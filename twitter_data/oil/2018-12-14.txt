Get a 1998 Altima for 500USD.

Change the oil.

It'll run for 400k miles.

2 2018-12-14 23:59:45 The atheist has not learned tolerance but they did learn that the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Isn't that what our society teaches now days 
3 2018-12-14 23:59:35 In SZ you can get the solvent used for paste in a little bottle to freshen up your paste... perhaps the same exists elsewhere? Smells like sweet almond oil so probably incredibly toxic 
4 2018-12-14 23:58:54 The more confusing thing to explain is the US dollar. It used to be valued based on gold, now its based on: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Basically the USD is valued because we agree it has value, we control the worlds oil supply, and we will bomb you to ashes if you don't accept our money. Fun!
5 2018-12-14 23:58:53 I’m from fairfax va! I tried krantom a couple times and it made me sick to my stomach. In the nursing home I was in we can’t smoke and I’m a smoker so I got a vape pen with cbd oil. They found it and took it away. I think it helped but I’m not sure since I was on morphine.

In fact I pay 0 for oil changes and 0 for transmission fluid and 0 for timing belt, it will be 8yrs for battery coolant and about the same for my brakes. 8 yr unlimited mile warranty for the battery and motor. It’s incredible.

45 2018-12-14 23:56:31 Business operates off margin. Increasing labor costs means I have to increase my prices over and above increased labor cost to maintain the same profit margin. The evidence you seek is basic math.
46 2018-12-14 23:56:27 @realDonaldTrump You support our people, but you have to show it in practice, the biggest support from the free people is that Iran is just a total boycott of oil, so that by the end of April, you can finish the Iranian oil, and leave the rest of the work to the people of Iran.
47 2018-12-14 23:56:22 Really should just stop subsidizing oil and pipelines.

52 2018-12-14 23:55:59 the obvious stupidity that can be seen in Trump, the denial of climate change, the seemingly systematic destruction of the environment (oil drilling on the shores), the derugulations to the detriment of the environment, the corruption that now shows in almost every Republican,

60 2018-12-14 23:55:12 I’m sitting at the shop, getting my oil changed in my car, and an old man is checking out. 
Worker*asking his info to check him out* “Last name?”
Old man *in a very inpatient voice*- “he just put that in there. Can’t you just pull it back up?”

61 2018-12-14 23:55:04 “Freedom” meanwhile thousands of good hearted American soldiers lost their lives so Bush & Cheney & co. Could make a quick buck. Did you know Cheney’s Halliburton won exclusive rights to oil extraction in Iraq? Fishy.

72 2018-12-14 23:53:50 bacon fat is best but olive oil (or lard! or dripping!!) works well. Butter you'd have to be careful with so it doesnt burn
73 2018-12-14 23:53:49 I've tried CBD oil recently and Kratom tea. The Kratom is amazing. What state or country are you in?
74 2018-12-14 23:53:48 Trump only understands 2 things. Sanctions and war for oil.

Soon, even our military won't follow his command. He can't even find someone willing to be his Chief of Staff. I have to go now. Khoda havez.

Maybe I should drop out and pursue art lol.
99 2018-12-14 23:50:17 The oil industry has been quiet for too long. The economic spinoff from this industry impacts all of Canada. Why took so long?

106 2018-12-14 23:49:42 The final Farm Bill legalizes hemp as an agricultural commodity and removes it from the federal list of controlled substances. It also defines cannabinoids (CBD) with a THC concentration of less than 0.3% as hemp, thus legalizing CBD oil that meets the 0.3% threshold.

108 2018-12-14 23:49:22 If oil subsidy is a scam, then what is president Muhammadu Buhari @MBuhari ?  SAINT ?
109 2018-12-14 23:49:21 Yes blame Russians, because all the the people in the streets are Russian bots.

You are making more money taxing the French people for fuel than the countries that produce refine and ship the oil to France.

So yeah, they are Russian bots and the answer is more taxes

111 2018-12-14 23:49:01 Congrats! As a woman who owns an oil and gas industrial service company, I can only pray I am able to thank @realDonaldTrump for making it possible.
112 2018-12-14 23:48:56 Brad, we pipe Canadian oil to Washington State where they have big refineries that process Canadian and Alaskan crude. They ship the finished products back to BC. These are integrated international companies who care nothing about what country they are working in.
113 2018-12-14 23:48:25 Really, ok, my truck needs an oil change, get on it.
114 2018-12-14 23:48:12 @SLFPSriLanka all are trying to get  popular on TV with #FakeMedia talking GARB. Pissu Puso Wage, it's like when you put Kerosene oil on a Rat Snake  or Garadiya.
115 2018-12-14 23:47:56 OBL and al qaeda should have been stopped by Clinton but he was more worried about good ratings than defense of country. And can you show me stats on all the oil US got out of iraq? France was working to develop oil when sanctions were lifted and fought w

117 2018-12-14 23:47:51 It’s not oil.
118 2018-12-14 23:47:43 Would be great start to extend tax credits for EVs (make up the $ from oil subsidies)
119 2018-12-14 23:47:28 you can toss prawns, prawns, clams, dye, once mixed in the oil, water is poured (3 cups of water for each cup of rice) and when it has absorbed the water is turned off and covered so that the heat ends to be done.
120 2018-12-14 23:47:26 @SUBWAY I found out today that your cookies contain fish oil  thankfully the vegetarian lady behind the counter let me know, the other two employees had no idea! Do you have plans to take the fish oil out of the recipe so that vegetarians can enjoy them too please?
121 2018-12-14 23:47:20 うふふ 冬のじじまごです
122 2018-12-14 23:47:14 Yeah, I'm sure the state that lives or dies on tourist dollars wants an oil spill off it's coast.
123 2018-12-14 23:47:02 I use Cetaphil for sensitive skin for my morning/night moisturizer and I love it! I also use a two faced primer before makeup and once a week put rosehip oil all over my face (usually Wednesday or Sunday!)
124 2018-12-14 23:46:52 If the recipe calls for frying small bits of turkey in grease before anything else, you'll calibrate right away. Tip on any stove, to brown things like meat: add bit of bread to oil and adjust heat until turns croutonish quickly without burning.
125 2018-12-14 23:46:52 The best way to fight fascists is *checks notes* providing them with oil to fuel their imperialist adventurism and signing agreements with fascist states called the Pact of Friendship, Neutrality, and Nonaggression between Italy and the Soviet Union.

127 2018-12-14 23:46:18 My car feels brand new after an oil change and tire rotation 
128 2018-12-14 23:46:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
129 2018-12-14 23:46:08 Halooo.. makasi udah mampir ke thread ku 
Itu face oil. Sbnrnya kegunaannya scr umum sih menjaga kelembaban kulit supaya kulit kita ga produksi sebum+oil secara berlebihan. Tapi, di setiap variannya ada fungsi masing2. Kebetulan aku pakai yg ricebran dan jojoba oil
130 2018-12-14 23:46:05 Thought Syria had their own oil? Ah no, silly me, the US grabbed that
131 2018-12-14 23:45:40 Really excited to try CBD oil to combat my propensity for ambling through life in an unrelenting disassociated panic.
132 2018-12-14 23:45:23 So raging my oil was stole. Whoever done it anyways hope yous stood on milos shit on your way out!
133 2018-12-14 23:45:13 We know profit is good 4 the business WE work 4 or WE own. Why not also 4 every business? Selfish profit is good 4 small salon and big oil.
134 2018-12-14 23:45:13 I think NATO is restrained from pushing back but if those oil powers can't find a plan B then they will take NATO down with them and we will enter an Asian centered international economy.
135 2018-12-14 23:44:54 Too much gun oil
136 2018-12-14 23:44:53 I just comb out my curls lmao n got hot vitamin E oil, I’m lookin like a mess and nobody braid but my sister who in Cali
137 2018-12-14 23:44:43 I hear a loud BOOM off the prow of party boat Detroit, upon inspection I find that on the horizon, the oil rig v*ltr*n has blown its own engines and is now spouting 50 foot high jets of fire into the sky, the string band is playing Despacito
138 2018-12-14 23:44:29 There's no point comparing the UK to Norway. They are one of the world's big oil producers and also have a relatively small population. Chalk and cheese. We will still need to buy heavily from the EU. And yes we will be failures if Brexit goes ahead
139 2018-12-14 23:44:28 "Take your soul, tell me what's the price bitch. Wrists leaking red blood like a oil spill. All this money got me feeling like I'm on that white shit"

141 2018-12-14 23:44:19 The simple truth nobody wants to tell us as Nigerians is; Oil is our problem, our economy is to dependent on Oil so any small movement in the price, gbam!!We are either in trouble or in plenty bt factually, with Trumps reluctance to ban SArabia, we are in trouble
142 2018-12-14 23:44:12 The oil industry lied!? *shock horror*
143 2018-12-14 23:44:04 >"demanding the immediate phase out of fossil fuels, including an end to oil and gas"
This will drive energy prices way past tolerable. Especially for apartment renters who cannot take advantage of rooftop solar incentives. AND -- will guarantee election of Trump types. Many.
144 2018-12-14 23:44:02 There wasn't any rooftop revenues, what we have then was just balloon economy and once the oil crash at international markets, the balloon burst and there was nothing to fall back on.
145 2018-12-14 23:44:00 Shark oil!!!
146 2018-12-14 23:43:43 They are vile, all of them vile snake oil salespeople.
147 2018-12-14 23:43:43 Girl no! Put castor oil on them every night before bed. I did it for a few months, and without touching them during that phase, they grew out. Try it out, maybe it’ll work if you’d like thicker brows 
148 2018-12-14 23:43:35 so i got an essential oil diffuser (non-ugly one god bless) and i think it could cure every illness i’ve ever had, muscle pain, and acne
149 2018-12-14 23:43:22 Justin Trudeau & the Liberals are soft on crime, soft on criminals, soft on our borders, soft on terrorists, but tough as nails on law abiding gun owners, male construction workers and the oil industry. #canpoli

151 2018-12-14 23:43:18 How’s the lawsuit against the oil sands coming along?
152 2018-12-14 23:43:04 Two onions, two head of garlic (about 15 good sized cloves), half a cup of olive oil, salt, pepper, hot pepper flakes, thyme, oregano, two tins of diced tomatoes. Simmer simmer simmer. Best & simplest pasta sauce ever. 
153 2018-12-14 23:42:53 If you read Oil, politics and violence by Max Sioullum sir, you’ll know that the northern forefathers planned all this from the start. That’s why we’ll continue in this mess even if we have competent leaders. So painful a whole professor(4mer VC) is assisting Adamu Adamu
154 2018-12-14 23:42:48 Climate change is another arrow in "The Left's Quiver" directed at destroying Capitalism and The Judeo Christian World as we know it! Criticise,denigrate and alienate to get people to stop using oil and push use of sources of natural energy!Welcome to Walter Mitty World!
  #COP24
155 2018-12-14 23:42:32 We don't want your stinkin' oil.  And certainly do no approve of what you do to obtain it.  Get with the program, transition to non-fossil energy sources!!!
156 2018-12-14 23:42:30 So we keep buying Saudi oil, the ones that stone there woman behead them and hang them from cranes. You better park all your vehicles turn the heat off in your home start wiping your butt with your hand because fuel is used to run and make products.
157 2018-12-14 23:42:07 How about legislation to stop Alaskan lands from being raped by oil and other corporations?
158 2018-12-14 23:41:23 I remember in 4th grade having to run a mile before I was allowed to have dinner (salad, no dressing because oil is fattening!!), even when I was feeling sick.
159 2018-12-14 23:41:23 a man just came in to use a phone charger bc of an emergency and then he had to borrow my phone and got oil grease on it and also yelled on the phone and also told me “this city has an underbelly trying to pull us closer to the devil” and i tried not to engage

- 2nd largest recipient of Oil & Gas money (2018)
- Voted 3x to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157)
162 2018-12-14 23:41:16 Flew in from Chicago, went to work, got the oil changed up, and did some Christmas shopping. 

Adulting is hard. Time for a drink and to relax.
163 2018-12-14 23:41:15 The oil tycoons are resisting their loss of relevance in the future.
164 2018-12-14 23:41:07 After her bath, I'd lie her down on my bed and give her a body massage with Welleda Camomile oil - then put her nappy and pj's on before her bedtime feed. #bedtimeroutine
165 2018-12-14 23:40:54 And on the other side of it..how many celebreties use the same brand they advertise for starting frm hair oil to paste to high end stuff !!! ..very few to none..so no point talking abt it isnt it !!! 
166 2018-12-14 23:40:32 Took my car to the shop today for one thing and the guy texts to say I need “3 new door latches, wiper blades, side marker bulbs, rear license plate bulbs, rear brake pads and rotors, brake fluid flush” and there’s an oil leak!!
167 2018-12-14 23:40:30 I drove my car 3000 miles across country and as soon as I arrived I took it to a shop for an oil change.  As I pulled into the shop, the car stopped running.  The engine had blown up.  I'm going to sue that shop!

172 2018-12-14 23:40:07 ..I should probably get paper intended for oil pastels, shouldn't I, and not use... Cheap sketchbook paper that is literally falling apart at the seams...
173 2018-12-14 23:40:01 coconut oil works wonders as a makeup remover!! literally melts everything off!
174 2018-12-14 23:39:59 Now @SheaMoisture knows they need to expand this Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil line to a styler and oil. I need more of the hydration and smell throughout the week.
175 2018-12-14 23:39:56 He is bery upfront about high turnover. If you don’t own his fund you really can’t complain. He is unmatched on knowledge of Cdn oil patch. Use that to your advantage
176 2018-12-14 23:39:54 This little girl is my hero and has more guts than the entire @GOP and every oil executive in the world combined!!!!!
177 2018-12-14 23:39:50 The world is changing so fast.  Hard to keep up.  But I think Russia will be a player in whatever happens because this is the oil countries vs global heating showdown.  It's existential for them.  They have no plan b.
178 2018-12-14 23:39:46 I did hear CBC's coverage the other day that suggested getting the world off thermal coal and converting transport to electricity/renewable fuels could actually hit the IPCC 2030 targets without shutting down current oil/gas (though not allowing an expansion) That gave me a hope.
179 2018-12-14 23:39:42 Hard to find Luis , best I could do is Coal  1000 grams/ KWh ,  Oil  800 , Gas  500 ,   Nuclear, Solar, Wind , Hydro al <   50 >  grams per hour

183 2018-12-14 23:39:16 Coconut oil or something that will constantly keep it moisturized has worked for me :/

187 2018-12-14 23:38:43 Now just keep up on your oil changes and don’t beat the fuck out of it every single time you drive it and it’ll last 
188 2018-12-14 23:38:36 You prob dont know this, never having been there. Nobody except BP lives in Antelope Wells. It's the least used port of any along the border.
This is VERY desolate area and between Lordsburg and the border there is Hachita, pop 40? and Animas maybe 150- 200.

193 2018-12-14 23:38:14 It’s a personal concern, not one I feel is a disqualifier. He is a (D) in Texas, he’s taken plenty of oil money and will vote/act accordingly. He’d still make a fine president or VP

197 2018-12-14 23:37:59 Yes, re oil. But authoritarianism is on the rise and democracy has the scars to prove it. The threat of nuclear weapons has never been more chilling.
198 2018-12-14 23:37:35 the USSR under Stalin aided the Weimar Republic and later Nazi Germany in their rearmament. Then the USSR traded oil, rubber, etc with Germany after the M-R pact, (which would be used againt the Soviet ppl!!). Not to mention the USSR literally invading Poland along with Germany.

202 2018-12-14 23:36:59 Bullshit. He didn't take any PAC money. Individuals who work for oil companies contributed to his campaign. Newsflash - a whole lot of people work for oil companies in Texas. I'm not sure he's ready to be POTUS, but the effort to smear him as an oil company toady is garbage.

240 2018-12-14 23:31:29 Like Alberta wouldnt want it's own currency. Besides, Oil keeps the Canadian dollar high hurting eastern exports so may be part of the deal. Could go with the American dollar like a 2 bit banana republic

260 2018-12-14 23:29:04 The technology isn't completely there to be 100% free from oil. The technology that is available is also very expensive for the average individual in Canada. But chin up, Alberta's oil industry is slowing down. Perhaps we will be the first country to stop it's oil industry.
261 2018-12-14 23:28:57 You are clearly a radical anti-pipeline, tree-hugging, eco-commie who just has it in for the sacred oil and gas industry of THE WEST and hate Alberta cuz you live in BC.  :)

272 2018-12-14 23:27:37 @shiva_sujeer ..This oil mafia...stealing from tankers and selling petrol diesel...because congi corruption method in people's blood..IOC official steals from petrol bunk..by asking bribe at bunks..otherwise.how come he gets a new SUV..every six months..my neighbour in mangaluru!
273 2018-12-14 23:27:33 Missing my 10min oil change place as I have been sitting at the dealership for an hour... wtf
274 2018-12-14 23:27:30 What's so wrong about wanting our tax dollars to be used for programs that benefit us - the tax payers, and not on Wall Street bailouts, corporate subsidies and oil wars?
275 2018-12-14 23:27:29 Fish oil. I saw some pinterest posts abt what vitamins to take & for what
276 2018-12-14 23:27:27 Hey Canadians, I'm perfectly cool with your whole #BuyCanadian #BoycottUSA thing so long as you keep your oil in your own fucking country and stop pushing your stupid, disastrous, jobs-killing pipeline on us. Thanks.
277 2018-12-14 23:27:20 Everytime I go to Ford for an oil change I come out with a brand new car.
278 2018-12-14 23:27:19 I miss working in the oil field just because of the corporate holiday parties

281 2018-12-14 23:26:41 Yeah and girls really be driving around on four dress belts with toxic waste for engine oil we all have our faults, your point?
282 2018-12-14 23:26:05 This is like complaining that is cost money to clean the gulf after the oil spill.
283 2018-12-14 23:25:55 Thanks Sweetie!

285 2018-12-14 23:25:36 GDP whose figures are majorly impacted by earnings in Oil, The real question is, Was Nigeria richer under the PDP in terms of real earnings? Yes, Why? Because the Crude Oil Market faired better. I think it's totally unfair to ignore the fall in revenue since 2014.
286 2018-12-14 23:25:31 When ur cooking with a crop top and hot oil burns ur tummy <<<<<<<
287 2018-12-14 23:25:22 Remember Paddy Adenuga epistle on losing oil deal that could have been a defining deal of his life, its bcos of this Man mindset, tho we need to be careful who we tell things to
288 2018-12-14 23:24:18 Today I'm using a Sonoma Chardonnay ($5.99) from Christophe Cellars, grapes from Sonoma, maybe a 2nd label from Napa. Chardonnay,shrimp, mushrooms, broccoli, sweet onions, carrots, olive oil & garlic in a slow cooker. Christophe Cellars is a Boisset Family Estates Collection.
289 2018-12-14 23:24:04 yall remember that one time i asked what would happen if i put chocolate milk in my essential oil diffuser
290 2018-12-14 23:23:59 Might be burning the midnight oil.
291 2018-12-14 23:23:13 Earlier this year I first read about the St. Kilda fulmar harvest: plucked white feathers swirling in the air like snow, the putrid stench of seabird oil that hung on everything, the single-minded bravery of the men on the cliffs. What a life those people led!
292 2018-12-14 23:23:13 How about the oil bottoming @51?
293 2018-12-14 23:23:11 Sensitive?  You realize that you came at my light tweet making fun of oil short sellers at the low with your barrage of bullshit Good Will Hunting stats?   Miss me with that shit.
294 2018-12-14 23:22:59 My cars oil life is at 15% , as is my will to live
295 2018-12-14 23:22:52 Oh boy you're thinking too much about it. Really it boils down to: robots are a waste of space and... They poop oil. Ew!
296 2018-12-14 23:22:20 Climate change is pseudo science. Climate has been changing since the planet got an atmosphere. Science is predictable yet not a single prediction has come to pass from the so called climate science. We can be energy independent now with our natural gas and oil fields
297 2018-12-14 23:22:12 But seriously the shadows in this are amazing. It would make for a an amaizing oil painting. My bestfriend is skilled with oil paints.
298 2018-12-14 23:22:11 knew i shoulda brought my oil pen
299 2018-12-14 23:22:10 Let's see proof of that. If you're going to claim that his foundation in funded by US oil companies, then you ought to name them.  Otherwise, it's just blather.
300 2018-12-14 23:22:04 i just get these cbd oil pills from a natural health store and whenever i feel like i’m about to get one or its starting to come one i just take one and it mellows out
301 2018-12-14 23:22:03 That's what I'd love to be able to do. Strange how we always want what someone else has.. But perhaps I'll try soon. I did a little oil painting in my youth of landscapes 
302 2018-12-14 23:21:17 @fordnation Doug Quebec wants to block our oil from reaching Irving refineries. Quebec is not a friend of Canada. Quebec is a leach and Trudeau has to go because he is not a friend of Western Canada.
303 2018-12-14 23:21:11 There was no Russian collusion so,under that umbrella Muller's going after every one conservative, worked,voted or liked Trump! Muller's a snake oil salesman! He'll never go after the real criminals above. Don Quixote Muller will continue to fight the Russian collusion windmills!

307 2018-12-14 23:20:42 Absolutely...  That picture just lied. In fact, that was politics. She edited the picture by deleting everyone on the other side. 
It should not be politics even when the gathering was political. 
Hope this made you smile.
308 2018-12-14 23:20:40 Correct.
Their acting Govt. leadership is parliamentary system.
Socialism is how their society runs.
Just like how it runs in the US for Oil corps, farms, banks, military, seniors. If we're gonna get to actually what is socialism in the US.
Won't change how we vote for "Leaders".
309 2018-12-14 23:20:34 Except the oil sands GHG is a whopping 0.15% of the worlds total - Shut It down now!!
310 2018-12-14 23:20:01 Why does it look like Veronica’s mom is drinking olive oil??
311 2018-12-14 23:19:53 And now he's got an "ally" in his war on AB. Legault had the audacity to state that "Alberta oil is not 'socially acceptable' in Quebec". I had hoped we might have an ally in him. No, just same old same old. Prefers to enrich a dynasty that kill & dismembers its critics.
312 2018-12-14 23:19:43 Because tarsands oil can't be refined in Canada, except for a small refinery in Alberta that should have been expanded decades ago. Refine it in Alberta.

318 2018-12-14 23:18:31 It's insane. Our species didn't evolve enough before we discovered oil and gleefully destroyed our habitat.
319 2018-12-14 23:18:02 bio availability plays apart for some of us the withdrawals gets more difficult the lower the dosage gets with clitch dosages being 900mg, 600mg, 300mg, 100mg (snake oil) right when you think it should get easier it can get more difficult.10% or less safe tapering Guidelines help

321 2018-12-14 23:17:55 Hey. Whistler had all of 1 gas station for decades to monopolistic delight. The second opened maybe two years ago.  BTW what is Alberta’s end game? The oil isn’t going to last forever and when the green energy revolution comes what is their economy based on? What is the future?
322 2018-12-14 23:17:52 Damn near a year my nose rings still haven’t healed. I musta gone through 5 whole tinctures to tea tree oil since August
323 2018-12-14 23:17:51 My friend is selling her car. It’s like 10 years old. So if anyone is looking for a 4 door sedan that’s rust free and that’s never had an oil change let me know.
324 2018-12-14 23:17:29 We love sets of olive oil and flavoured balsamic vinegar from local tasting rooms!  And this year we found cool word card games for conversation starters 
325 2018-12-14 23:17:26 It means that the 1trillion Naira APC govt is paying annually for subsidy is as a result of their incompetence in handling the oil sector, not for the benefit of any Nigerian! #IncompetenceSubdidy!
326 2018-12-14 23:17:23 No that's the german massage oil:p
327 2018-12-14 23:17:03 Jack dick humour what’s the deal? Oil Sykes dies in the states. Everyone goes see AA BB and UO.
328 2018-12-14 23:16:54 Nigeria was in a state of collapse, and I think ud agree that you fix the foundations - paying of pensioners back-logs, building roads, rail network, developing agriculture etc. All with revenue from oil price at about half the price it was 4 years ago, and an ever

331 2018-12-14 23:16:09 Friggin idiots would be better off huddled in the dark with whale oil lamps, trying to compose fear-based legislation with feathered quills.
332 2018-12-14 23:15:45 Who have failed to remain neutral. 

If you want to persuade them make a bargain, the Crimean population is mostly Russian, that's your interest - not hurting Ukraine - and to prove it, you will give the oil rights, share sea. No more war, no more animosity back on track.
333 2018-12-14 23:15:25 Sides that. I like being crude oil.
I'm Tennessee.
334 2018-12-14 23:15:24 You must keep in mind XRP will be the “oil” to literally connect various digital/tokenised assets through an immutable and interoperable platform.

336 2018-12-14 23:15:11 Missing the @RTESportAwards for the first time in a good few years, an army of colleagues still in the @RTEsport office burning the midnight oil to put the finishing touches to it. Promises to be a great show I reckon.
337 2018-12-14 23:15:02 I don't think it's the AB oil and gas companies contributing to your so called problem, it's you pot smokin hippies in Whistler that are the problem. AB will contribute by staying clear of Whistler..hows that for helping out. Less traffic on the hill means less energy being used.
338 2018-12-14 23:15:01 Alberta needs to reduce its dependence on oil. 
Any doubts or questions?

341 2018-12-14 23:14:42 Alternatively: good ol’ oil!
342 2018-12-14 23:14:39 I don't want to think about "Oil Derrick Dingu".
@badkaratemovie @corbydavidson @oldwaver
343 2018-12-14 23:14:35 Better comparison is tropical atoll living which *can* be optimized for those things and simulated with modern tech. I think there are tons of challenges but oil platforms/commercial ships aren't a good comparison. 2/2
344 2018-12-14 23:14:11 The Pew family aka Pew Foundation originally invested in the oil sands way back decades ago. It was called Sunoil . Later they sold it and it eventually became Suncor. Interesting how a family making millions off Canadian oil now leads a foundation supporting oil activism.
345 2018-12-14 23:14:10 Will the PPV still be available on Lucas Oil Racing TV?
346 2018-12-14 23:14:10 So being physically fit & attractive no longer increases the likelihood of finding a romantic partner?  
I wish that was the case when I was a teenager.  Despite the fact I'm no oil painting I did quite well in my 20s once I got a six pack. That was a LOT of effort.
347 2018-12-14 23:14:09 How else is there to explain it, the climate has a mechanism.  The Sun, GHG, tilt, orbit, eccentricity etc all play a part.  But the oil lobby has taught you to think, "Ah, dinosaurs had it hot, they didn't have SUVs, where's your global warming"
348 2018-12-14 23:14:05 you thought wrong. Now stop wasting your time.
You have me very wrong.
349 2018-12-14 23:13:23 The oil serum I just made is 
350 2018-12-14 23:13:20 Not a 'seasteading geek' but: Oil platforms aren't optimized, in terms of location (they're dependent on where the oil is) or construction (they have to hold heavy drilling equipment with signif. thrust forces rather than just housing etc) for living. 1/2

357 2018-12-14 23:12:33 Was @SecretaryZinke there?  The great DOI leader that cares for Native rights?  Or only if there is coal/oil on their land... 
358 2018-12-14 23:12:28 I'm against any subsidies, we need to stop subsidizing oil too.

Take your money, subsidize oil, refine it to fuel, fine the refineries, they pay it's often cheaper than compliance, then tax you at the pump to pay for roads.

Crony bureaucrats take a cut on every exchange.
359 2018-12-14 23:12:28 Hmmm. Takes money from big oil and lies about it. Doesn't support #MedicareForAll. And let's be real, he couldn't even beat Cruz... no thank you.
360 2018-12-14 23:12:26 You know that ain't a crowdfounder to have support, it's wan for human trying to survive and not die. A fool nd out cos my maw told me about it, a personal mate of hers. Aw he wants is cannibus oil and legally, its his only #hopeoverfear

Call them "Oil Change" because you gonna get a new one in about 4 months.
362 2018-12-14 23:12:22 For hair, you get a spray bottle, add 8 parts water and 2 parts oil(carrier and essential oils) 80:20%. You use this mixture to spray moisture to moisten your hair anytime you notice dryness or you need to comb it, it prevents breakage too
363 2018-12-14 23:11:50 Hey can recommend what oil I need to buy to sleep better, thanks
364 2018-12-14 23:11:50 me during a massage:

my brain during a massage: yAS GURL. WERK.  those knots outta my shoulders.  HIT. the pressure points on my feet. BLESS.  me with that lavender aromatherapyoil. WRAP. me in those heated towels.
365 2018-12-14 23:11:36 Money is merely the oil that greases the gears. Contracts are agreements between 2 ppl. Jobs are an entirely different animal which I do not have time to discuss. The market impeding human action, directing markets in some way either large or small doesn't make it free.
366 2018-12-14 23:11:34 Wow oil and diamonds!there is wealth in Africa
367 2018-12-14 23:11:19 Tried some cbd oil earlier to see if it helped with the joint pain. 

It really does. Recommend it to anyone.
368 2018-12-14 23:10:40 Your an idiot the world is developing faster than its transitioning to alternatives. Developing world's need and want cheap energy sources. Global oil usage is expected to climb until at least 2050 so like I said after I retire. Until then you can watch with envy as people earn.
369 2018-12-14 23:10:36 It’s ok lots of people in my industry I wouldn’t hire. Assuming the same for oil and gas managers.
370 2018-12-14 23:10:33 You have depended on oil for how many years again?. China has depended on its production capacity making it who she is today. Your clueless leaders still hoping on oil to boost the GDP of this country, even the clueless ones are talking about agriculture.
371 2018-12-14 23:10:33 Yeah around Oil mill.  I school in Unioort tho so mostly in alakahia. .. hbu

374 2018-12-14 23:10:26 Maybe they both can build the oil pipeline together
375 2018-12-14 23:10:26 Goodnight Toni. I wish you well with your shares.
376 2018-12-14 23:10:18 Go in for a $60 oil change and it's estimated to be $400 in updates/replacements/etc.

381 2018-12-14 23:10:02 How nice, no they really did predict a mini ice age along with Peak Oil, which the United States just passed Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer, 0 for 2 there
382 2018-12-14 23:09:41 I get them too. Black coffee, washing down 2 Tylenol extra forte....and rub On Guard essential oil on the back of your neck. Works for me.
383 2018-12-14 23:09:40 Hey Hey oboy chaiii someone should call 911 oo
Do you the price for crude oil till 2014 and pick free money about oboy are you kidding me
384 2018-12-14 23:09:38 You are the ones working there versus here. If the shoe fits, lace that bitch up and wear it. Two minute search to find 200+ oil and gas jobs here.
385 2018-12-14 23:09:37 Outrageous, and their baby mineral oil!
386 2018-12-14 23:09:33 Oil change and then 
387 2018-12-14 23:09:32 aww man, u drinkin kool aid. U rlly think he was gonna beat Cruz running as the white Obama? Also: we all know that 'he took oil money' epithet is kind of bullshit. Impossible to not 'take oil $' when u get $ from half of Texas.
388 2018-12-14 23:09:10 Bro they really got me on this one, 90$ fucking bucks for an oil change 
389 2018-12-14 23:09:05 @JustinTrudeau Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba should separate from Canada east and form Canada West. We could pipe our oil to Hudson Bay and not be blocked by BC or Quebec. Canada is obviously too big for us all to get along. Maybe you can straighten this mess out real soon.

398 2018-12-14 23:07:48 There are people VEHEMENTLY defending the man that murdered his pregnant wife and two small children, before  dumping their tiny bodies in 2 seperate oil tanks, and his pregnant wife in a shallow grave...on the grounds that

 she nagged him

I just can't
399 2018-12-14 23:07:45 Won’t be around as long as you think. 56% of oil and gas is used for transportation. How’s the ICE vehicle market doing? Give it 10 years, watch half the oil and gas market dry up.
400 2018-12-14 23:07:35 Has been amazing to watch unfunded liabilities grow at $100 billion dollars a week & accelerating Luke. Almost as amazing as watching them HFT rig the prices of gold & oil down as our debt literally goes exponential. When the lid blows off this baby it's gonna be a sight to see.
401 2018-12-14 23:07:29 Slow up buddy. Both flower and oil@both have their appeals
402 2018-12-14 23:07:27 Up to 4-5 years ago oil was 110, jobs were plenty and the revenue was there to hand out to the east like play money. Why doesn’t Justin do something about it now since he claims to be helping ... cause he’s no better then his dad.
403 2018-12-14 23:07:13 Chicken soup, and probably lots of Ginger in boiling water(after it is cooled a bit.) May help.
But what do I know? lol.
Oh, do you know of Oil of Oregano Theresa? Good for sore throat.
I had big time chills a week or so ago, and Tylenol Cold and Flu for the night, two nights.

409 2018-12-14 23:06:18 I just bought a necklace for a friend there. It is a great place. She sells peppermint oil and if you dilute it with water and spray it around your house it deters insects especially spiders and stink bugs

Houston is known to have world class medical centres like Anderson Cancer research center and space exploration as well.

Apart from those, Houston is also a hub for oil and chemicals.

Good bye to lone star state, Texas.
414 2018-12-14 23:05:53 If not babe I think cbd would be awesome. It’s a “high” without being high if that makes sense. More a relaxation and euphoric feeling. And cbd now comes in flower and concentrate form so you can smoke it like weed or oil and it has zero thc
415 2018-12-14 23:05:46 なんとなく想像できます

416 2018-12-14 23:05:41 Be ruthless in sticking to principles and the rule of law.  If the banking criminals had been sent to jail after 2008, we would be better as a country today. If justice had been done then, maybe so many wouldn't have fallen for the Snake Oil Salesman and his Crime Family.
417 2018-12-14 23:05:20 You must either have stock in oil or are an oil industry employee

419 2018-12-14 23:04:58 Next summer, I’m marching around the whole county with no shirt so i can flex my ripped, chiseled, and WASHBOARD 8 pack. I’m throwing all of my shirts in the trash on June 19th, 2019 and I’m rocking out with straight baby oil. And I’m walking around with a gallon of water just bc
420 2018-12-14 23:04:52 The vast majority of oil industry families continue to feed their families.
421 2018-12-14 23:04:31 I’m so confused on why I need so many filters and the most expensive oil every time.
422 2018-12-14 23:04:04 Argh. This one spot on the roof of my mouth keeps hurting when I eat citrus anything today. Even the lemon oil in my candy.

429 2018-12-14 23:02:15 Ok, that was silly. If there were no humans, oil would not be in barrels. It’d still be in the ground. Sorry. I got carried away.

435 2018-12-14 23:01:47 Why is a mayor of one eastern Canadian city traveling the world! Visiting countries that compete with Canadians for oil? While blocking Canadian oil pipelines! What benefit and for who?  Just makes no sense to me!

440 2018-12-14 23:01:07 Nothing has inherent value. Only people create the concept of value. What is the value of a diamond or gold that is never mined? What is the value of anything without humans to assign it? If there were no humans, would a barrel of oil have a price? Or a parcel of land?

442 2018-12-14 23:01:02 Saudi does not need the US in Yemen, as the US is a complete failure in Afghanistan for 15 years.

Saudi does not make much money from the US, as they export very little oil to them.

Saudi has 10 times more US dollars in reserve than the US itself.

No, it is a partnership

460 2018-12-14 22:58:42 Will there be a sea port in #Rajahmundry city by the year 2050 ?

Key risks

1. Rising seas (Global warming e. al)
2. Sinking earth (reportedly a result of oil & gas extraction)
3. #Polavaram dam (and ensuing fall in earth recharge)

470 2018-12-14 22:58:03 The transition to renewables will come in time, which will be good over all.

485 2018-12-14 22:56:23 So many things. Kava kava tea is really calming and lavender oil relaxes me and helps me sleep. I love a meditation app called Calm.

501 2018-12-14 22:53:46 @realDonaldTrump there are those in the world that argue that we should dump coal, natural gas, fuel oil, and nuclear to generate electricity in favor of green sources.  Can't do it until we can support 24x7 operation with green sources.  The greens are less than 10% of our power
502 2018-12-14 22:53:38 You’re a liar, these are not real numbers, don’t be fooled by this snake oil salesmen
503 2018-12-14 22:53:13 Nope, nothing to do with the glut of oil and the depressed price of oil.

511 2018-12-14 22:52:19 Yup, we all recall Alberta Premier Lougheed railing against the existence of all that oil and gas infrastructure. Why? Because it was in Ontario, silly. Too bad Alberta squandered his Heritage Fund, eh?

518 2018-12-14 22:51:10 Really, we only start to see deviation when constraints are a factor, such as Germany's frequent problem of potentially running out of oil for airplanes, or the Soviet Union's hasty defense during Barbarossa which relied very heavily on political mobilization.
519 2018-12-14 22:51:03 So many oil rich countries to invade!
520 2018-12-14 22:50:56 Well if you care to listen subsidy was removed shortly after they came in 2015 that was why pump price increased to 145 so at that point no subsidy until world crude oil price went up in 2016 hence increase in landing cost of refined products and subsidy returns.

542 2018-12-14 22:48:10 It’s only taken over 7 weeks of falling oil prices. About time @goapplegreen @pjcoogan
543 2018-12-14 22:48:05 Happy note: I bought motor oil. Have wine for Voltron party. And gonna get kh3 +ps4 on Jan29
544 2018-12-14 22:47:52 It was useful being raised in Alberta before I started my career, used to crying oil workers. Trudeau doesn’t do anything for us. 4.5 billion on a pipeline, extended ei benefits retrospectively to cover when harper wouldn’t.
545 2018-12-14 22:47:48  ya oil ama ?
546 2018-12-14 22:47:46 the oil change place off university and grandview

548 2018-12-14 22:47:25 Always wanted to do this, hopefully I'll find some oil next week
549 2018-12-14 22:47:23 You can use coconut oil or I just put organic chapstick I buy for myself from the store on his lips sometimes!
550 2018-12-14 22:47:16 Yeah that sounds perfect... I know you can get beard oil and stuff too

CBD oil
Intravenous vitamin C

Just a couple of cures we already have, but not allowed to know about or use them. Big pharma is only interested in keeping us sick or killing us. Shove it ABBVIE.
554 2018-12-14 22:46:29 Your logo and iconic mascot is a humpback whale, don't you think you should pull ALL advertising/support from @FoxNews programming and any other entities who deny climate change or support sonic explosions to search for oil in the oceans?
555 2018-12-14 22:46:20 when you apologize to the guy at bolton oil change for your overdue miles and he says" oh this aint nothing, this girl came in 30,000 miles overdue" 

LMFAOOOO
556 2018-12-14 22:46:13 Glad my brakes & this oil leak getting fixed 2mar!
557 2018-12-14 22:46:12 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
558 2018-12-14 22:45:59 Not at the expense of crushing the middle class.  Every time you wave your pen on this topic,it costs us money. How about not doing anything until you have a better sorce of energy than oil and natural gas.

561 2018-12-14 22:45:14 Stir up trouble in the middle-east, pull border forces boats out of service and what could go wrong before an election. I mean just because Murdoch and his mates who own Genie Enrgy are drilling for oil in the Yemen!
562 2018-12-14 22:45:02 1) Yeah because the oil market was booming, look daddy I understand your pain, this is the first time your voting that’s why am not disappointed in you like you are in me, this govt has a alot of faults, agreed. My point, since PDP didn’t file a better candidate,
563 2018-12-14 22:44:51 Ah, the sublime beauty of having a kiss in front of a bonfire located three feet from a shop full of motor oil.
564 2018-12-14 22:44:50 @HeatingYourHome absolutely fuming.  Had an oil fuelled heatslave boiler installed just short of 4 years ago.  Every year since it has broken down despite being regularly service.  Just spent another small fortune having a new burner.  Last year was the pump.

Fact: The NBS said at Q3 2017, Nigeria had about 11,547,236 motor vehicles in the country.

#PeterObisLies #2019debate
571 2018-12-14 22:44:15 The misery in that country is the result of years of mismanagement, policies that your ilk would like to install here. Progressives loved Moore’s film about Venezuelan healthcare. Joe Kennedy craved that pittance of oil from Citgo....

576 2018-12-14 22:43:34 Large dosages of CBD oil can cause drowsiness in healthy individuals, and drowsiness is a common symptom of many diseases  Most people do take small doses of CBD oil so looks like it adds up to me 
577 2018-12-14 22:43:16 After all that was and still is going on in France, I am extremely surprised that his government didn't refrain from signing the UN Migration Pact. He just put oil on the fire.
578 2018-12-14 22:43:03 I def gotta get a oil change when I get off tomorrow

586 2018-12-14 22:42:25 I just wanna know how I go to Jiffy Lube for a simple oil change and air filter change and pay over $100 with a discount.
587 2018-12-14 22:42:23 WHAT I REMEMBER. At this time of year I reflect on things the way they were when I was young. We had a coal burning furnace with what looked like tentacles moving the heat to the whole house.  All the houses in Canada used coal to heat our homes until oil was brought in, then gas
588 2018-12-14 22:42:22 Free market is a great thing!! Oil companies failed to innovate the market, and they are failing to adapt currently. Any company that cant evolve will eventually die!
589 2018-12-14 22:42:12 The reporter that died was Muslim brotherhood. If trump scolded and sanctioned Saudi’s the mkt would fall. Theywoukd pull $300 billion purchase order and give it to putin and he would restrict oil supply to USA and gas would be $7 a gallon

592 2018-12-14 22:41:48 I think a Good point was made against the THS, why watch the PBA when the locals toss higher scores than seen on tv or at the tournaments. The blue oil doesn’t help the perception since it looks like a house shot on tv
593 2018-12-14 22:41:33 ma’am no... i got suggestions is you need body oil is wonderful and keeps ya soft
594 2018-12-14 22:41:27 Saran ku ya nder. Cuman pake tomat yng di bekuin + baby oil asli mantul banget  aku pake soalnya jerawatku juga pada kering
595 2018-12-14 22:41:08 We need to be rapidly transitioning off fossil fuels not expanding capacity. But nobody wants to stop developing. Beto pays lip service to climate change while letting oil companies continue the status quo. Meanwhile every year the planet gets hotter.
596 2018-12-14 22:41:02 Avocado oil!
597 2018-12-14 22:40:48 The opinion of a group that wants to pay high school dropouts $30,000 annually ($15/hour) to submerge fries in oil until a bell rings is dubious at best. #stayinschoolkids #gop

616 2018-12-14 22:39:40 Well said! I think its silly for them to be mad. They have failed to evolve. Any company that cant evolve will eventually fail. Imo they shoulda invested their money into building the future car market, not just milking oil forever. But maybe thats just my opinion!

620 2018-12-14 22:39:09 I can excuse the spelling mistakes and grammar, of course, but not the logic.

You are blaming the EU for things that are actually the fault of successive UK Governments.

We chose not to build enough houses. We chose to underfund the NHS. We chose to spend all the North Sea oil

629 2018-12-14 22:38:14 Ry: Got it. We, Americans, should just throw out our morals, ethics, values & principles and just align ourselves with dictators, a few people here and there can be killed just so long as our oil prices stay low. Money matters more than people. You have lost your moral compass.

in 2017 i shipped 32 essential oils box in one box as IATA Regulations

now they say only one 5ml essential oil in big box of 12*10*4 which is $38.99 x 150 oils !!!
it is expensive
is it new IATA Regulations demand only one small essential oil
i could fit over 50
653 2018-12-14 22:34:27 Hi Jack, in all honesty it’s been a long time since I’ve used any oil based gloss so couldn’t comment on long term performance. There are lots of W/B options around now that outperform oil finishes.
654 2018-12-14 22:34:22 look all I want for christmas is an oil change
655 2018-12-14 22:34:16 I am still doing experiments on the optimal order for adding the ingredients.  The egg and the curry paste are giving me fits.  May need to try with a different oan to keep the egg from sticking and the oaste from absorbing the peanut oil
656 2018-12-14 22:34:11 No government job here. Just one where I see oil workers crying like babies. One day you will see someone like me, crying or we will have to clean up your shit. No maybe, guaranteed.
657 2018-12-14 22:33:57 Rob Portman is nothing more than a smooth talking snake oil salesman who is too terrified to hold a town hall north of Columbus. We @OHDems need to mount a campaign to vote him out!
658 2018-12-14 22:33:39 Coconut oil is so overrated
659 2018-12-14 22:33:35 OMG I am at work and someone drove threw the bay doors of the oil change place and hit one of my coworkers. I'm so glad he is okay! there's a lot of broken glass to clean up, I would show a photo of aftermath, but not allowed to. I't was so nerve-racking. Stay Safe Bruddas!

661 2018-12-14 22:32:58 It's not black and white, most people aren't 100% progressive 100% of the time. A Texan politician taking individual donations from the leading oil producing state in the country is less unforgivable sin and more understand who lives in your state.
662 2018-12-14 22:32:53 my art teacher wants the class to have whole ass acrylic/oil paintings done over the break :) rude to assume people just have those supplies at home but go off i guess :)
663 2018-12-14 22:32:45 Separating will literally make it harder to move oil out of the province. And when the industry does die we will have only Alberta to support our transition. What is the upside of this idea?
664 2018-12-14 22:32:42 Baba will clear your doubt, there won't be interference
665 2018-12-14 22:32:38 Thought they were still to produce a report which will take 2 years as to whether that oil is commercially viable or not. So we are truly mortgaging our country away... the Chinese willing to print paper on a promise. Zvakaoma
666 2018-12-14 22:32:27 Most Atikulooters are just after 3 square meals but If eventually the global price of crude crashes drastically today most of the errconomists here will see what corruption can cause on an oil driven economy.

668 2018-12-14 22:32:17 And you are right. Our resource, oil, has afforded the opportunity for all of CA to become enriched. Lived and worked oilsands in McMurray for over 25 yrs. Met all sorts from CA and all over the world there. Their lives were made better for the experience.

673 2018-12-14 22:31:39 The recent revelations that oil companies have been working to rollback gas efficiency standards so they could sell more gas isn’t surprising. This is part of SA’s plan to build nuclear power plants and sell their petroleum to other countries.

676 2018-12-14 22:31:22 40years of mismanagement by Conservatives has brought Alberta to where it is today. We never paid our way; instead we relied on roller-coaster funding from oil royalties & we never put a dime away for "rainy days". So spare me the outrage - you Conservatives ARE the problem.
677 2018-12-14 22:31:20 My son is in the Permian Basin oil patch working.
678 2018-12-14 22:31:16 Hello where's the extra slut olive oil pls the virgin kind is gonna be uncomfortable in my kitchen
679 2018-12-14 22:31:03 They need to lose the first word in extra virgin olive oil? Either the olives are virgins or they're not. And do they take an olive's word for it?
680 2018-12-14 22:31:02 Here we are again, Chris and facts.
Like oil and water.
681 2018-12-14 22:30:56 China's emergence happened in 15 years, we had oil since 1959.
682 2018-12-14 22:30:47 Mix 8 oz dates with 9 tsps broccoli. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve to your worst enemy.
683 2018-12-14 22:30:34 I hope after Xmas when me & @Katie31Savage come back up to Glasgow for another @CelticFC match for weekend my good friends on Twitter who buy my cbd oil & who don’t will be in the pubs around gallowgate if so I will gladly buy each one of you a  that’s how av  been brought up
684 2018-12-14 22:30:26 Umm has he heard about this thing called an EV? Does he know that he has sued the oil companies? Oh and he impounds ELECTRIC BIKES??

The hypocrisy is five layers thick. He looks like a damn fool.
685 2018-12-14 22:29:43 Petrolatums are petroleum by product. Its actually classified a waste product after producing everything else that can be derived from crude oil. I doubt it's deadly. You see kids cracked skin in winter despite being shiny? That's the reaction to petroleum.
686 2018-12-14 22:29:39 I didn’t even know there were that many types. But this could be helpful. Also I left the cardboard base I was going to use at work, for any cardboard too? Maybe some oil and some kitty litter also.
687 2018-12-14 22:29:39 Oil in Zimbabwe?
688 2018-12-14 22:29:38 I agree Heid, the effort some put in to the cause is incredible and I include Ade, Pete and Tony on the front line along with supporters like yourself. Too many throw stones and yet make little effort
689 2018-12-14 22:29:32 Lol, you believe the scientists but let’s keep up drilling for new oil even though we’re already the biggest oil producers in the world. That happened during Obama’s shift.
690 2018-12-14 22:29:28 Wouldn't you expect this? Oil and gas acreage carries uncertainty (is there an oil and gas field?). Not so for wind....
691 2018-12-14 22:29:27 And then oil sprays everywhere....
692 2018-12-14 22:29:10 If you work in the #oil and gas industry, stainless steel #nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
693 2018-12-14 22:29:07 They should learn to code. Move where the work is. Like the oil fields of North Dakota.
694 2018-12-14 22:28:57 Is the fuel powering that emoji rocket coconut oil or unicorn farts?

No va a cambiar en nada la situación lechera y el resto de los sistemas productivos , sino bajan el gas oil , energía  y la carga impositiva!!! MEDIDAS FUERTES YA!!!
697 2018-12-14 22:28:49 Abeg about how much was crude oil when Bubu raised petrol prices?
698 2018-12-14 22:28:32 Coconut oil becomes a fad and dumb brands and internet accounts will make life hacks using everything under the sun. Charcoal got trendy and they started putting that shite in toothpaste.  pathetic.

700 2018-12-14 22:28:30 @centraltimewpr CBD oil is NOT homeopathic. Dictionary: homeopathy is a system of medical practice that treats a disease especially by the administration of minute doses of a remedy that would in larger amounts produce in healthy persons symptoms similar to those of the disease
701 2018-12-14 22:28:18 Oil flows? Do you know how much a barrel cost now? Out major buyers now have mad supply of oil so who do we sell to?

703 2018-12-14 22:28:09 LOL.  I give him 90 days before he registers as an agent for some middle eastern oil interest.
704 2018-12-14 22:27:59 Oil?
705 2018-12-14 22:27:46 Man, I always get the 5ml bottle of essential oil alone in a box the size of a shoe box.  a 4x6 padded envelope would have done the job.
706 2018-12-14 22:27:43 Fish oil 
707 2018-12-14 22:27:33 To further help you see the weakness of your point. Until 2017, the largest importer of crude oil was the USA. Would you say they don’t produce a large amount of oil used locally? Fact: The largest producer of crude oil globally is the USA.
708 2018-12-14 22:27:30 @FirestoneAuto $75 for synthetic oil change in Odessa TX. You got to be kidding me...

710 2018-12-14 22:27:08 #US Economic Data: #BakerHughes Rotary #Rigs (Dec'8-14) : #Oil: Rigs ↓-4 rigs w/w, ↑+126 y/y. #State: While New Mexico deactivated ↓-5 rigs, Wyoming activated ↑+5 rigs w/w. #Basin: Permian & Williston, both ↓-3 rigs w/w, while Utica's count went up by ↑+1 rigs w/w.
711 2018-12-14 22:26:59 We don't? The whale oil industry didn't end overnight.  Nor did anyone say it was useless. Burning it as fuel is the issue. Most car makers are at the point of leaving it behind. The next 20 years will tell.
712 2018-12-14 22:26:58 How we spent the afternoon.  Note that 2 of the dogs have collars on, which is normally a big NO for me, but I had to have an oil change, I had a couple of harness get chewed up recently, and those 2 are my personal dogs who do well on-leash, so I made an exception.
713 2018-12-14 22:26:41 I cringe when someone reaches for the truffle oil
714 2018-12-14 22:26:41 i use stuff from the pharmacy:/ and make sure to hydrate my skin cause like if your skin isnt hydrated it will produce even more sebum/oil to balance it.. but my skins still shit cant confirm anything im just trying my best dgsfh

716 2018-12-14 22:26:14 loool stoooooop. deep condition it. use a hair mask like every two weeks. and oil it! you can just get a leave-in conditioner that you can spray if you're feeling lazy.
717 2018-12-14 22:26:02 Stella, I'm adopting a Pug this weekend & have a question about #SardineSunday. Are the sardines you eat water packed or oil packed? I want my new doggie to be healthy with a shiny coat.  Thank you.

721 2018-12-14 22:25:23 Fry garri with onions. Add salt. Use dried catfish to eat it and drink water. You can even use palm oil if you like, it's a free world.

723 2018-12-14 22:25:15 No. I’m Canadian and we can produce more oil. And yes I recall the oil shortage
724 2018-12-14 22:25:14 Our plan for getting our oil to water is to develop a landlocked country. That's the kind of outside the box thinking that's made Alberta so prosperous in the past.
725 2018-12-14 22:25:10 I still don't understand why all of our governments haven't collectively participated with tesla through funding and this new industry approaching us. We could be preparing students and existing oil and gas employees to have careers in a productive, solution paced future;
726 2018-12-14 22:25:06 Maybe sauté veggies in olive oil with salt/pepper?  Sometimes salads/raw veg tear me up too.  I switch to sautéed or roasted green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage Or Brussel sprouts and it rights the ship.
727 2018-12-14 22:24:59 There is also zero smog days a year in Alberta and Northern BC.  Funny how this is the place where our oil & gas come from!
728 2018-12-14 22:24:57 Coconut oil!
729 2018-12-14 22:24:48 Newsflash: The UK already decided to leave.  Sturgeon is hell bent on using this lever Scotland away from the UK, so is she just being a spanner in the works, or has she a better idea?  Has she any idea? Should we file under currency and oil deficit?
730 2018-12-14 22:24:26 What’s the biggest white lie you tell your parents? Mine is when I tell my dad weekly that I’ve made plans to get my oil changed.
731 2018-12-14 22:24:17 "When oil was at $100 per barrel, there was no infrastructure, now, we are spending more on infrastructure with 60% less earnings" - VP @ProfOsinbajo ... #VPDebate #2019Debate
732 2018-12-14 22:24:11 Yeah, but Iran, Libya, and Venezuela are all proof oil production is not just a matter of being able to extract the oil. Multiple types of political disruption can slow productions, and I greatly fear possible political climate for Russia in future.
733 2018-12-14 22:24:02 Waiting for my oil change and I’m in the waiting room where a tv is on. Family Feud is fun but WOW Judge Judy is not. Lol
734 2018-12-14 22:23:58 No kidding man, I’m paying 100$ a bottle in Canada with Aphria’s Rideau oil. Totally worth it however.
735 2018-12-14 22:23:57 Your just plain wrong. If it was commercially viable it would happen. If people could afford it, it would happen. If the energy produced was reliable & stable, it would happen. But currently renewable tech is none of these things. Medical grade plastics & 90% cars still need oil

740 2018-12-14 22:23:07 Ireland gets about 80% of its oil and gas from the UK, how will that affect things?
741 2018-12-14 22:23:07 We have to pitch in taxes while oil is low. And there is a secular trend towards declining oil prices.
742 2018-12-14 22:23:06 I have a SUPERPOWER! I am able to tell when a piece of fried food was cooked in burnt oil. The metallic acrid smell triggers a instant gag reflex. Thankfully I use my cape to clean up afterwards.
743 2018-12-14 22:23:04 Cannabis cures. Alcohol kills. Been my moto for years! Happy to hear CBD oil is helping you. I would also recommend creams if you can get your hands on them. Some vape shops in London sell them secretly. Once Ontario gets stores it will be much easier to find.
744 2018-12-14 22:22:53 Looool sis I kinda have soft one sometimes I wash it and leave it like that imagine and don’t even oil it

748 2018-12-14 22:22:18 I’m tired of my face producing so much oil, like please stop. Thanks.
749 2018-12-14 22:22:05 @afowler06 what Cbd oil do you use and where do you get it from?

752 2018-12-14 22:21:47 Mr. Macron from france is trying really hard to push for making France a leader in clean energy, but you can see that the far right who loves oil has created so much violence by promoting destructive protest.
753 2018-12-14 22:21:46 It has petrolatums. Some kids are allergic to that. My kids are so we migrate from 1 cream to another and eventually we find one that works. 

Creams that don't have harmful chemicals are generally not cheap. 

Coconut oil is also great for skin. Kids friendly too
754 2018-12-14 22:21:46 hello how good is the macphersons oil gloss at holding it's whiteness?
755 2018-12-14 22:21:41 Somehow avoided it. Heard a slight knocking. Lights came on for low oil. Got pulled over quickly. Mechanic said synthetic oil probably kept it from freezing up and likely stopped just in time
756 2018-12-14 22:21:31 Try Jamaican castor oil you can get it from Amazon ppl around me have tried it with wonderful results

758 2018-12-14 22:21:07 I think it may have been established 2013.

And Queen "purred"..

787 2018-12-14 22:17:47 Since the CWC is inversely proportional to gasoline (crude oil) prices, when oil prices are low the waiver credit is high to help these new fuels compete with their petro counterparts.

798 2018-12-14 22:16:54 In my humble view Saudi (As bad and often worse than the rest) managed to get the west to take out their opposition. Houses of Gaddafi, Assad and Sadam Hussein.  Why? Because Saudi had the oil we desired & fabulous riches to bestow!  Iran next in line.

812 2018-12-14 22:15:23 Maybe she does a few lines of Aderall with the snake oil salesman in chief before she goes on the air!
813 2018-12-14 22:15:15 Oh no what is CAUSING that, what oil or resin is leeching out of that plant!
814 2018-12-14 22:15:14 The entire plastics industry, and quite a few others, are based in oil industry products, transformed through chemistry into many things. And no, they can no more be held responsible for that than the steel industry can be held responsible for guns made of steel.

820 2018-12-14 22:13:55 Looking for that special gift?  Tallahassee friends, we will be at the Market Square Farmers Market tomorrow morning with the best extra virgin olive oil in town!
821 2018-12-14 22:13:47 Zomigosh, my workplace has a holiday social on, and they have little oil burners so you can roast a marshmallow and make your own hot smore, and it is AWESOME and there is ALMOST NOBODY HERE and I feel so bad for the organizer because seriously, this is AWESOME.

823 2018-12-14 22:13:23 So Doug, you are saying you are responsible for the low gas prices? So this mean that you now control crude oil prices & are responsible for the drop in oil that have put Albertains out of work! You can multi-task! You can kill jobs in two provinces at the same time! #onpoli
824 2018-12-14 22:13:15 I donut have oil film i put my trust in u Lord pls dont make my make up melt NSDJNDJDNDNFNFJF
825 2018-12-14 22:13:13 So I've got a long way to go with Atticus and this social studies project and decided to grab my weed pen with the oil that reduces my stress level. I accidentally grabbed the one I use for my insomnia instead and right now I am soooooo fuuuuuuuuuucked.
826 2018-12-14 22:12:55 I usually use a bit of avocado oil and just make it on a pan!! U can just cook it in the bag in the microwave I think but I don’t like doing that
827 2018-12-14 22:12:48 For driving a car ????

831 2018-12-14 22:11:52 ...how much his Western-backed assassination pertained to oil/preservation of USD/other bullshit

I dunno if he was a decent man or a monster, I've heard both. But it just made me sad thinkin bout what positive things could've potentially happened for Libyans if he lived

834 2018-12-14 22:11:40 Perhaps youll be able to recommend an alternative to oil?
835 2018-12-14 22:11:38 Last winter I used Sheer Wisdom lip oil cuz i get wicked dry easily. No one even noticed. It did the trick but was kind of expensive.

...even if there were papers put down to catch the loose oil?
841 2018-12-14 22:10:55 All in the name of oil.
842 2018-12-14 22:10:48 People don't face reality hence we keep going back to Corrupt individuals. We need to compare Nigeria to other developing oil dependent economies globally to judge this government. Everyone wants to be China,, Malaysia, Singapore and Netherlands in 2 years. People just like scams
843 2018-12-14 22:10:45 Fuck off! Heroin & patchouli oil! The bastard louse

846 2018-12-14 22:10:30 Both Kate Brown and Jay Inslee can talk about acting on climate all they want, but the bottom line is if they’re allowing new oil and gas infrastructure development in their backyards then they’re ignoring the IPCC report.
847 2018-12-14 22:10:27 With a 2.75% oil - how many drops would you start off with?
848 2018-12-14 22:10:24 Customer service in Detroit .. is like oil in water .. ain’t mixing

850 2018-12-14 22:10:18 Thought I posted this all day sorry, I gave my friend this recipe and it seemed to work so here goes 260g self raising flour, 1 TSP xantham gum, 1 1/2 TSP baking powder, 1 TSP salt, 480 ml milk. Oven to 200 with 1 tbsp or less oil heated up in each hole bake for 15-18 mins
851 2018-12-14 22:10:14 Can’t do anything without that oil huh?
852 2018-12-14 22:10:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this December? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
853 2018-12-14 22:10:02 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
854 2018-12-14 22:09:52 Thanks for your interest, my friend. But the idea is, Wind turbine / solar panel / etc. power battery that generates electrolysis. Then H2 is transported or used for thermal power plant (in replacement of coal, fuel oil, etc.) Kinds regards.
855 2018-12-14 22:09:37 FYI I support legalization of weed but I don't toke, smoke or drink.  I use CBD oil for pain in my hands,  that's all. Boring, I know
856 2018-12-14 22:09:33 As I type this...radiator fluid and oil is flowing into the sound 
857 2018-12-14 22:09:28 But he and ask her servant maid said, "Long as we've served you, you've never poured oil on their hinges, and his wife, and
858 2018-12-14 22:09:21 Yeah it’s a process. My skin used to be terribly oily and I found vitiman C oil and a super tiny amount of jojoba oil helped. If you’re finding that too frustrating try a gel based moisturiser
859 2018-12-14 22:09:21 the amount of people who just say awful disingenuous shit so they can sell books or snake oil pills or whatever the fuck but end up creating a bunch of morons who believe their trash...... this is why we as a society are going to fail

863 2018-12-14 22:08:48 Your barely at the venue so pls don't politicised everything
864 2018-12-14 22:08:48 The vast majority of the oil fields are currently in Scottish territorial waters. It's hard to see how rUK could reasonably claim ownership.
865 2018-12-14 22:08:18 Here's where we'll start the second half of December for some US crude oil grades:

WTI - Cushing Futures  - $51.20 bbl
WTI - Houston              - $57.00 bbl
WTI - Midland              -  $43.25 bbl
Bakken-ClearBrookMN-  $48.00 bbl

Not exactly finishing the year on a high note
866 2018-12-14 22:08:14 One of the worst December markets ever under @realDonaldTrump and @Republicans. Oil down and dollar high earning that these guys really did damage to economy. @CNBC @FoxBusiness
867 2018-12-14 22:08:05 Give it a test drive, Rev it out and see if it hesitates at all, Check any service history. Coolant and oil. Bushings are sometimes a problem to, pull on the top of each wheel and see if there is play side to side. At least it give you a fighting chance.
868 2018-12-14 22:08:02 yet to find an oil that doesn’t break me out!!!! also find it difficult to stick with them because they make me more oily lmao i know i probs have to wait for my skin to adjust but it’s just miserable

870 2018-12-14 22:07:50 Cenovus: "We are not attending the investor conference in Whistler because we need to take a stand against these non-stop unfounded attacks on our industry that fail to acknowledge the huge focus the oil and gas industry places on reducing emissions."
871 2018-12-14 22:07:49 Our Federal budget is N7 trillion. Our Federal tax revenue alone is N5 trillion. Our oil revenue is much bigger than these. Yet, why do we still borrow to fund our budget?
872 2018-12-14 22:07:48 If you wanna speak with an Irish accent then say ‘Whale Oil Beef Hooked’ really fast 
873 2018-12-14 22:07:44 That’s not a sound logic. Our oil still flows and citizens still pay taxes. There will always be resupplies to the shop..

876 2018-12-14 22:07:21 Finally getting an oil change  this poor 1999 van is a trooper! Pretty soon it'll finally be able to retire from long commutes and just be an in town vehicle.
877 2018-12-14 22:07:14 #beautyroutine = blacksoap mixed with honey and tumeric scrub. Coconut oil to moisturize thank me later
878 2018-12-14 22:07:13 There is huge carnage in the general market.  Oil won't move until the weekly reports make the cuts obvious.
879 2018-12-14 22:07:06 Tea tree oil fixes everything
880 2018-12-14 22:07:03 Having a car is cool and all until you gotta start paying for your car payment each month , get an oil change , new tires , alignments .. and the list continues

882 2018-12-14 22:06:54 If this government has actual announced "oh let's Forget the past loot's" let's start afresh!! With 60% less income. This will go well with PDP online influencers and supporters. The past leaders owns Oil wells, and refineries outside the shore definitely  they ar feeling heats
883 2018-12-14 22:06:30 One of them (GoFundMe?) kicked Laura Loomer off at least. Maybe they’ll catch on to Straka eventually. He is a snake oil salesman peddling hate and propaganda to grandmothers on fixed incomes.

887 2018-12-14 22:06:14 Don’t really know, just random diet with high protein, moderate carbs, low fat ( 1 whole avocado in only one meal) and olive oil.
888 2018-12-14 22:06:13 But that’s the true 16 years of high oil prices with very little to show for in terms of infrastructures.

900 2018-12-14 22:04:41 Both those extreme diets are composed of idiots. Proven healthiest diet (if you care and deprive yourself) is fish, olive oil, fruits and vegetables (the end). But they put carcinogenic and neurotoxic pesticides in everything, so you're still fucked. Enjoy a sensible diet.
901 2018-12-14 22:04:37 Wait. Everyone knows the @jsbmbaggedmilk ‘s Frank is an Oil Kong’s fan.
902 2018-12-14 22:04:26 This was their plan all along. They Re selling public lands to the Extraction Corporations. Big Oil and Coal. Shameful.
903 2018-12-14 22:04:04 @StudentsInvest  Going to upload an an interesting 2 videos regarding some macro analysis I did on oil markets.... The recent 1.2m bopd cut agreement on supply, the effect of distillate draws on consumer demand and whatever else of releveance that investors these days ignore

911 2018-12-14 22:03:02 I disagree with you @segalink , do you know the kind of corruption going on in Nigeria? No nation on earth can survive the kind of corruption we had in Nigeria. We are much better when you compare with other corrupt oil dependent developing economies. We need reality checks
912 2018-12-14 22:03:00 Oil and water. The wait is over.

916 2018-12-14 22:02:22 I believe it wasn’t oil’s fault. The problem is that oil is so valuable it attracts greed. You won’t find greedy dictators fighting over who gets to own wind mills and solar farms. No value and certainly no wealth building there.
917 2018-12-14 22:02:21 Lost in this is the fact that "breaking down" every 8k miles is a lemon! Imagine a breakdown before every 3rd oil change.
918 2018-12-14 22:02:21 Oh bugger auto correct got me again! Roags
919 2018-12-14 22:02:19 Many of these grifters have side hustles of selling snake oil... Amway to beet juice to protien powder. Playing on fear and insecurity from every angle.
920 2018-12-14 22:02:17 In Aug. oil companies bid $178 mm to drill on 801,000 acres in Gulf of Mexico. (~$222/acre.)
Today, wind* companies bid $405 mm to build offshore turbines on 390,000 acres off Massachusetts. (~$1,038/acre.)

*Actually, two winning bidders were Shell & Equinor, so...

933 2018-12-14 22:00:35 I had roast cauliflower at a dinner and now I make it bc it's so easy; you keep it whole, blanche/boil it for 10+- mins, coat with butter or oil and whatever herbs and spices, and roast it. It slices into thick slabs and melts in your mouth. It looks great too. Now I want it...
934 2018-12-14 22:00:33 December 14, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

937 2018-12-14 22:00:25 @Poli_Climate listening to the “solutions” episode, and just curious: rather than building methane pipelines to oil drilling sites (to avoid flaring)WHY NOT: build *temporary* distributed generation on-site to hook into the nearby electrical grid similar to how solar or wind do?
938 2018-12-14 22:00:13 there is no ethical way of making a living by extracting oil and gas we have to #KeepItInTheGround
939 2018-12-14 21:59:59 Kandy Pen 1/2 price with oil only $39.99. Like JUUL but better!
940 2018-12-14 21:59:50 Would you drink a glass of water with only 1 drop of crude oil in it?

Why not? The water is clean. Most of it is pure water. There's only 1 drop of oil.

When you try to enforce your values thru The State...The State is the oil.
941 2018-12-14 21:59:47 CBD oil helps me a lot w chronic pain, some of which is cramps. Just gotta make sure you’re getting the legit stuff and not a rip off, my grandma gets mine from some health store in gentilly I think
942 2018-12-14 21:59:31 Fighting wars in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan for oil interests is obscene.  Denying climate change is obscene, the average American paying $1500/yr extra for fuel with a wage bump of +$10,000 is practical.  You have no clue how much it will cost if we don't act.

944 2018-12-14 21:59:24 @pennjillette @SweetMattyD My one and only issue with having to stir natural peanut butter: the jar isn’t big enough to do the stirring when the bottle is full. If the oil settles on top and the jar is full, there isn’t enough extra room to stir it without making a mess

948 2018-12-14 21:58:54 I did a project with an oil company in which H&S had become formulaic to such an extent that people had become blind to it. Accidents were on the rise. The answer was to re-personalise it. To get leaders to tell personal stories. So it does work!
949 2018-12-14 21:58:34 Don’t forget oil has had a 120 year head start.
950 2018-12-14 21:58:33 I’ve brought the topic up to about a dozen random people through my day at work today.  Most people I’ve either never interacted with or people I see every few months, all Oil and Gas folk. I got a lot of rolled eyes and two “is this a thing people are talking about?”
951 2018-12-14 21:58:29 What this debate showed me was the insensitivity of Nigerian politicians to the real matter that ails this nation. None of candidates especially the other 3 addressed the fact that unless our economy runs solely on oil and the need for change not CHAINJ.
952 2018-12-14 21:58:21 Got off work, gettin this oil changed and then its off to start this weekend 
953 2018-12-14 21:58:18 I’m here at pep boys just trying to get an oil change & some lady just starts talking & talking to me about church 
954 2018-12-14 21:58:09 All these knuckleheads sell snake oil on the side.
955 2018-12-14 21:58:05 How many feet of oil?
956 2018-12-14 21:57:59 Start slow...like 2 drops in morning and 2 drops by evening and build it up. Read also the subscription from the cbd oil you use....
957 2018-12-14 21:57:59 “Fryer Oil Deluxe, the Scent of Flavortown.”
958 2018-12-14 21:57:58 He overdoes the pasta, doesn’t put oil in so it sticks together and puts a spoonful of ketchup on top
959 2018-12-14 21:57:54 NL government can just overestimate the price of oil (again) and dig itself out of this cluster fuck.
960 2018-12-14 21:57:07 I have huge sympathy for anyone who is out of work, no matter what industry they work in. But the lionization of the oil & gas industry (Mr Wilson's post above) is something we need to move past. As shown by the suffering in every bust cycle, we need to get off this one-car train
961 2018-12-14 21:57:03 But the specs are opposite oil vs gasoline, right? How do you interpret that
962 2018-12-14 21:56:36 Hahahaha what! You do know NK just got caught transferring oil right isn’t this against the sanctions?!
963 2018-12-14 21:56:35 Do you believe that the imminent disorder you have predicted will be a net positive for the climate... ie higher global oil prices=reduced consumption= fewer emission while also more famine=fewer people=fewer emissions?
964 2018-12-14 21:56:34 Commies should realize blood oil money from the gulf (other than genuine worker salaries) can only source them for so long until they have oil, after that the sheikhs & others are free to work in India for the livelihood.
965 2018-12-14 21:56:34 When did I say that? I'm saying it's not easy. Give me an example of a business that doesn't rely on oil money in Alberta. You suggested green energy- where you look for clients? Lets say the general public. Oil goes down - general public has less money to spend on green energy.
966 2018-12-14 21:56:28 @colinflaherty @willieonradio Gas is at $2.07! So Saudi Arabia kills a reporter and as a result gives us cheap oil? I’ll hold the next one down! ......too soon?
967 2018-12-14 21:56:23 @realDonaldTrump should impeached fast before the market crashes and the economy is destroyed. Economy is bad. I arming signs are low oil and high dollar. @CNBC @foxandfriends @MSNBC @FoxBusiness
968 2018-12-14 21:56:13 What you need to do is email landmark dodge and ask why it took 5 hours for an oil change when they told you 2 max! @landmarkdodge

970 2018-12-14 21:56:01 30% decrease in blood flow mediators from free oils, 20-40% decrease in blood flow to the brain from caffeine, and ultimately 100% blood flow in cardiac arrest. Your food choices matter. Go vegan. Oil free, caffeine free, whole plant based vegan.#vegan #diet
971 2018-12-14 21:55:48 It’s a gimmick that would appeal to many who watch those obnoxious tv cooking shows. Try my gold infused dipping oil on my platter.  If this happened at an event I was at, I’d be asking how many carrots &where was it mined , so I could be righteous & annoying
972 2018-12-14 21:55:46 But in the meanwhile, why not share the wealth of the oil with the People who really own the oil?
973 2018-12-14 21:55:44 People won’t want to pay more? Look. Oil has been a great, practical solution. But the drawbacks have become intolerable. No one solution can replace it, which implies an evolutionary, not revolutionary process. We are on our way, but not by 2030. 2050, maaaaybe.

Straw man, there was no claim that doctors were scientists.

In actual practice (sic) all doctors are trained to use scientific methodology and have been since around 1890. Doctors are not magicians or snake oil salesment

988 2018-12-14 21:53:58 i guess my last thought on this topic for the moment, a rephrasing of my previous points: investors like stability and predictability, at least as long as investments require long-term outlays of physical capital that is hard or difficult to move (factories, oil rigs, farms)
989 2018-12-14 21:53:43 Swear I’ve been avoiding this oil change for far too long.
990 2018-12-14 21:53:37 Instruction fro Murdoch must have okayed the embassy move. Must be big oil involved.

1001 2018-12-14 21:52:04 Shows there’s more money offshore for renewables than there is for fossil fuels. And two of the winners are historically oil and gas giants recognizing a shift and getting ahead of the curve. Progress towards the zero carbon economy we need will only reinforce this dynamic.

ETF (exchange traded fund) is a financial product, which tracks the performance of an index or a commodity (like gold or oil) or a basket of assets.

Advantage of ETF is one can take a position in an asset without actually purchasing that asset directly.

It'd be better they subsidise production or agriculture so as to help those battling against the odds of lack of 247 energy in the production sector.
1063 2018-12-14 21:45:20 It’s brutal Dirk. Crime in this part of the world skyrocketed when oil plummeted a few years ago. Junkies lost their jobs and have resorted to almost anything for a quick buck to find their next hit.

1070 2018-12-14 21:44:27 It's West Texas, a lot of people work in the oil and gas industry. That is not the same as being supported by the industry itself as is typically done with PAC like Oil and Gas PAC.

1086 2018-12-14 21:42:52 I don’t think Walker will be invited to do a coin toss or first pitch anytime soon! This Republican power grab is typical of their arrogant, self righteous attitude. Reminds me of Saddam torching oil wells on the way out of Kuwait..
1087 2018-12-14 21:42:50 I believe you’re referring to the agreement on refugee resettlement? Not quite “open borders”. You still haven’t provided proof that Soros has any sway over Trudeau. Oil and gas billionaires have far more sway than Soros.

1089 2018-12-14 21:42:32 I heard hi m this morning, and shocked myself by agreeing with him. As someone said , it says a lot about the state of our politics that the snake oil salesmen like Blair are believed!

1092 2018-12-14 21:41:25 Getting a oil change for a hemi so hurtful 
1093 2018-12-14 21:41:22 Yes mam, its tweeter and you seem to have chosen links on oil.However, you might like to sellect other topic by typing search on type.

1096 2018-12-14 21:41:14 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1097 2018-12-14 21:40:46 This is beautiful. Ugh, I'd love to get into oil painting.

Vs this government your lips will be dripping with saliva to see the extent of PDP looting
1100 2018-12-14 21:40:41 I dont know LeeAnne personally, not LGBTG (but support them fiercely) & only speaking facts seen on RHOD (plus maybe a little hint of knowledge gleaned from my career & those i associate with who drip oil) so perhaps try something different, oh & #spellyourhashtagscorrectly hun

Why is a country that has the worst violations on woman's rights, freedom of speech, religion etc... an ally? OIL . If we were truly a great nation we would have ditched them after 911 instead of Iraq

1106 2018-12-14 21:40:23 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1107 2018-12-14 21:40:23 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1108 2018-12-14 21:40:14 Ya ever had a true meltdown in Kroger because you couldn’t find the fucking olive oil.......don’t worry I’m doing it for you.

1110 2018-12-14 21:40:05 Don't Want Ads - Snake oil is making a comeback. Trudeau is the spokesperson and is demanding you buy it.
1111 2018-12-14 21:40:03 Favorite part of getting my oil changed at Valvoline is when they yell “GOOD TO GO BAYYYY 1” fucking hilarious 
1112 2018-12-14 21:39:57 As strong as that was it looked to me at ground level that it went over the bridge, I guess we would see oil or gas coming up, wouldn’t won’t to be on the bridge!
1113 2018-12-14 21:39:49 Yes. Peanut butter is a recipe not ground up nuts. Sorry it needs some palm oil, salt and touch of sugar. If you want the taste of just peanuts, eat peanuts. Dead on about Tots. Every homemade Tot is either mushy or tooth breaking hard.

1116 2018-12-14 21:39:23 I really need to start making time to do my own oil change. It’s cake but yo girl busy then when I’m not busy I get lazy.
1117 2018-12-14 21:39:06 Guys!!! COME ON!!! FFS!!! We can do WITHOUT PALM OIL!!! GRR!!!! 
1118 2018-12-14 21:39:05 No matter how many times you practice what you are going to say to the mechanic, to just get an oil change. It never flows as good as you plan it on the drive there.
1119 2018-12-14 21:38:57 Quebec claims no social license for pipelines, but Saudi oil paddles up the Saint Lawrence through sewage and no one seems to care!
1120 2018-12-14 21:38:46 My fiancé is so perfect  I am busy at work so I can’t do an oil change & he came & picked up my car 
1121 2018-12-14 21:38:44 I try to avoid eating anything with palm oil in it!

1128 2018-12-14 21:38:03 Then you’re set. Get your jammies on, have lots of hot tea, use warm (not hot!) olive oil in your ear, and use a cotton ball to keep it from running out. Feel better!

1138 2018-12-14 21:37:08 Fennel oil. Lemon oil and lime oil in my water. So good.
1139 2018-12-14 21:36:58 That's insane!  Try Vitamin E oil on the wound for it to heal faster!
1140 2018-12-14 21:36:55 Also the oil industry effects every other industry in this province including service, housing, tourism, banking etc. So this is not just about oil.
1141 2018-12-14 21:36:54 How much oil is being transported through this pipeline to market?
1142 2018-12-14 21:36:47 Reentry $tqqq at 43.00, next order to fill at 38.00. Eyes on $uwt oil breaks $50 start to add...
1143 2018-12-14 21:36:45 Yummy. Polvo à pescador (aka Polvo à galega). The secret is all on how you cook the octopus. Best the fishermen’s way: after it’s cooked, just sprinkle sea salt, pimenton la Vera and olive oil just before serving. That seasoning goes great with avocado and others.
1144 2018-12-14 21:36:40 Pas maaal. Après Joan Baez je l'ai déjà vu et dans mon souvenir... Bah ça a vieilli quoi. Et peur que Midnight Oil ce soit pareil. C'est où

1146 2018-12-14 21:36:39 That’s really odd. 
Some coconut oil right on your lip/nose might help the burning

1153 2018-12-14 21:35:39 @jacksoncrompton thanks a lot dude. CIBC cancelled the oil and gas portion of their annual conference, and will be looking at moving it to Banff next year. 1000 people with the flushest expense accounts around aren’t going to Whistler all because you’re a raging hypocrite.
1154 2018-12-14 21:35:22 Are you voting for more oil drilling too? We can't have both!
1155 2018-12-14 21:35:18 But the govt hv been selling crude oil and LNG. So the shop is fixed...

1172 2018-12-14 21:33:18 True, for eczema we tried all modern ( in USA) creams but no relief, what worked for us is virgin coconut oil ( normal coconut oil is little thick to spread ) this was best
1173 2018-12-14 21:33:12 They make us argue about the funniest things....why are we even talking of subsidy? an oil producing nation....it should be the cheapest commodity in our nation. But here we are ...arguing over fuel subsidy when the real issue is - IT's OUR FUEL! - why are we needing subsidy?
1174 2018-12-14 21:33:09 have you tried just CBD oil?

1182 2018-12-14 21:31:37 Two fake twats that need put stocks and fed extra spicy  bratwurst & castor oil
1183 2018-12-14 21:31:28 I’m not clear that anyone is saying that MAKING things out of oil is a bad thing. It is BURNING oil that is the problem.
1184 2018-12-14 21:31:23 There’s not enough space on twitter to even get started. But, oil prices, TMX, carbon tax x1000, senseless spending, causing investors to flee, losing our national credit rating, migration compact, trade war with the US, typical socialist BS. The list goes on.
1185 2018-12-14 21:31:17 Most of what I poured missed!  The bottles were stone, I think, and they had metal spouts, like an oil bottle has. It was rubbish ink. It used to rot the nibs of the pens. I think they used to mix it up at school? We weren't allowed to use biros.  (1/2)
1186 2018-12-14 21:31:13 Ladies (and gentlemen), if you need your fluids checked or the air in your tires checked come by and see us. We won't charge for it, even if you aren't getting an oil change. We just want you to be safe out of on the road.
1187 2018-12-14 21:31:05 You do know the US doesn’t put up all their crude oil/pretoleum up for sale right? They conserve/store it, in case of emergencies. What’s actually used to sell and ran through our economy is mainly imported from OPEC nations
1188 2018-12-14 21:30:59 At scale...cheaper than oil or natural gas without subsidies. And 100%. I suppose that means fertizers, etc, too. We are making progress, but 2030 is only 10 years away. That is a moment.
1189 2018-12-14 21:30:54 Of course they blocked it they are about pushing oil and coal so again get the lobbyist out of your governments. Your governments don't work for the people they work for the lobbyist that line their pockets with their money.
1190 2018-12-14 21:30:52 You still need to get an antibiotic. The warm olive oil is comforting, but it won’t cure an earache or swimmer’s ear.

1200 2018-12-14 21:29:41 My belief is that oil is not Alberta’s strength, our entrepreneurial spirit is. Our demographic is made of some the youngest and most highly educated people in Canada. Even if the day comes where our oil isn’t needed our private sector will lead the way in another direction.

1202 2018-12-14 21:29:36 Interesting.  Of course, offshore O&G exploration is some of the least-favored, most economically-challenged acreage in the oil patch in this commodity price environment, whereas offshore is highly-favored for wind.  So it's a bit of a skewed comparison.  Permian $25-$50k/acre.

1207 2018-12-14 21:29:14 On a serious note, there are really two aspects to this:
a) It's easier to camouflage when you publicly position yourself as the polar opposite. Makes leakages easier to discredit.
b) Nobody is more conscious of global warming than the oil companies, so to speak

1220 2018-12-14 21:28:00 you only get oily skin if your skin is extremely dry, it's your body overproducing oil to compensate. you still need to use a hydrating moisturiser. don't buy into the 'oil control' products they make your skin worse

1224 2018-12-14 21:26:59 Fuck San Antonio for not having oil changing places that can fit my low ass car inside 
1225 2018-12-14 21:26:52 Really can’t understand why any right thinking person would vote PDP that got us into dis mess in d first place when oil prices were at an all time high. Granted Buhari hasn’t done what we hoped for,but seeing as d new parties don’t have d capacity to win,the APC is our best bet
1226 2018-12-14 21:26:46 It does get to be pretty damn old though. I've averaged over 35,000 miles on my car since I bought the thing. I feel like I'm changing the oil every other week.
1227 2018-12-14 21:26:42 And not to be outdone, @oLIV_oil_ just finished the toughest semester of her college career while helping 50 freshman handle life as college students as their RA.  #soproud

1229 2018-12-14 21:26:39 So are you saying that Alberta should not have made so much money selling oil?

1232 2018-12-14 21:26:29 How sad this Peter guy is Mr President.   He doesn't realize what you have done for the economy, unemployment rate for everyone.  Oil independence and exporting.   I bet his his paycheck and consumer confidence is up.  Although he won't admit to it.  Yes, Peter is sad little man.

1239 2018-12-14 21:25:16 Adding oil to the flames may not be wisest here... LibrePlanet is a fine and safe conference, and spats between high profile attendees are nothing new. I've been privy to at least one of the incidents in replies here but I can't even be sure of that because of this shit medium.

1241 2018-12-14 21:25:06 Scotland has been subsiding the UK for decades, they enjoy 90% of oil money generated. Scotland would be one of the wealthiest countries in the world if the UK wasn't sucking on Scotlands teet. If we were such a burden, they wouldn't be scaring pensioners to remain in UK
1242 2018-12-14 21:25:00 Hey! A Fryer using cooking oil is very Unhealthy! It would be better to offer a large capacity Air Fryer! Please rethink your Holiday Giveaway! 
1243 2018-12-14 21:24:57 I hear ya Omar but we might have to convince the ‘big fella’ to bin those oil lamps he’s using 
1244 2018-12-14 21:24:45 I know. I can’t sleep without a certain amount of fat in my diet. My sister is the same way. So i have a protein shake around bed time and if my diet was low fat, I do the olive oil. It gets me at least 5 or 6 hours.
1245 2018-12-14 21:23:50 #Cowboys RG Zack Martin is out for Sunday at #Colts.

The last time Dallas didn't have Martin play a game was Dec. 29, 2013 vs. the #Eagles. Dallas could have clinched the NFC East with a win. They lost.

A chance to clinch the division is on the line at Lucas Oil Stadium.
1246 2018-12-14 21:23:43 Gbam! And how much was crude oil per barrel during their era of massive looting?

1248 2018-12-14 21:23:20 In August, companies spend $178 million for offshore oil leases ~ $222/acre
Today, companies spent $405 million for offshore wind leases, or $1,310/acre.

Kinda interesting, right?

1255 2018-12-14 21:22:36 See, if the oil industry was efficient; (extraction, production and logistics ) then we wouldn't need to worry about subsidy.
1256 2018-12-14 21:22:35 I don’t understand?!? “Don’t drink?!?”  Things like cooking oil?
1257 2018-12-14 21:22:35 Rub A535. Motor oil.
1258 2018-12-14 21:22:29 You're right. Trans Mountain Pipeline Company was created by a special Act of Parliament. Ownership of the company was split between Canadian Bechtel Ltd. and Standard Oil.
1259 2018-12-14 21:22:27 Picking recruit is like changing the oil for your pet, why did you do that when you could have done anything but that.
1260 2018-12-14 21:22:15 Lawnmower start fail.  

I took the spark plug out, cleaned and dried it, checked the oil, filled the gas tank, and pulled 20 times.  Not even 1 pop.
1261 2018-12-14 21:22:02 @askslim Watching Big Picture. So far the DJI and stock rankings 2.5 to 1 negative are very informative & useful for coming year!

1268 2018-12-14 21:21:00 He talked about the government inefficiencies in the oil and gas industry and also stated the need to priotize other sectors like Health and Education.
This government had continually denied the existence of subsidy before now.

1270 2018-12-14 21:20:47 Please evolve your mindset beyond fossil fuels. Let's embrace renewable energy for a stronger economy & healthier future. Your desire to open our public lands to more oil, gas & mining extraction is severely misguided, myopic & detrimental to our national interests. #CarbonTax

1274 2018-12-14 21:20:25 How can Canada continue to use/sell oil/fissile fuels and claim to be working against Climate Change? Oil=pollution. Wherever oil based products are used, they create pollution. MAKE CANADA OIL FREE, GREEN ENERGY CHAMPIONS! Now that would be a legacy! @JustinTrudeau

1280 2018-12-14 21:19:52 It takes 100x the amount of pure CBD to get the same effects as you would get from CBD with just a hint of THC. CBD oil works but you just have to use a bunch of it sometimes to get the effect needed for it to work. This came from my doctor when I asked him about trying CBD.

1290 2018-12-14 21:18:55 #2019Debate Here is a fact: Average oil price in the 16years of PDP was $55.88 while for APC in the last 3yrs is $40.31. Also the average oil price during the first 3yrs of PDP was   $22.32. So @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari should stop misleading people stating PDP had $100 for 16yrs
1291 2018-12-14 21:18:45 Has Buhari not ruled the country before? When Buhari ruled first, was there no oil exploration in Nigeria? What did he do ?
1292 2018-12-14 21:18:42 It's FRYday! To celebrate, you can order your next tank of oil on our website and save $5 with promocode: FRYDAY
1293 2018-12-14 21:18:27 I think the next “plan” is to go through the US. 

The fact is oil is still moving, but just like textbook economists they want to move more, and faster. 

Under economists way of thinking, turn all your resources into cash ASAP. 
Very bad policy. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
1294 2018-12-14 21:18:26 Stupidest response ever.   Shipping is one of the biggest CO2 producers.  Add that CO2 burden to your oil production  footprint.
1295 2018-12-14 21:18:24 listening to oil company representatives argue about they charged me hundreds of dollars to fill my tank and it’s empty still lmao
1296 2018-12-14 21:18:23 @FBI ...yes George. Meanwhile,stay in your lane. Don’t be a stain, like the one we need to hose off our driveway on a hot summer day...no amount of kitty litter can absorb the oil from your leaky transmission- you’re welcome for the haiku. Happy Holidays 
1297 2018-12-14 21:18:15 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1298 2018-12-14 21:18:11 But actualllllyyyyyyy...castor oil (from castor beans) might have been named that because it was formerly used as a substitute for castoreum, which was used in perfumes, and does indeed come from the perineal glands of beavers. So.

1300 2018-12-14 21:18:03 That they are printing money might be true since #Zimbabwe is currently without currency and nothing wrong with that. They cant pay with oil since the discovery has not been assertained as yet. Payment is maybe the usual gold, diamonds, wildlife and tobacco.

1308 2018-12-14 21:17:00 How much oil was being produced when Alberta joined confederation? Pretty sure it would be a major difference if Alberta separated right now
1309 2018-12-14 21:16:57 I’ve heard of neem oil but I don’t know of anyone that’s done it so 
1310 2018-12-14 21:16:54 Bear in mind he was only appealing to folks in Texas, so he couldn't be to tough on oil. If he runs on a national stage I would expect him to be more progressive on energy.

1320 2018-12-14 21:15:59 It’s the budget rule: has decoupled the 1:1 link between oil & rub. Oil of course is still important but not like it was. Plus beeakeven price for budget is now fallen again to $50 says ING so even more wiggle room for govt

1326 2018-12-14 21:15:27 Totally agree with everything you say Peter - the elite simply do not get it -or do but are not willing to take #climateaction - they are working at a snails pace so as not to upset Big Oil when they should be working at breakneck speed to equal the challenge of #climatechange
1327 2018-12-14 21:15:23 “When oil was at $100 per barrel, there was no infrastructure, now, we are spending more on infrastructure with 60% less earnings.”— Vice President, @ProfOsinbajo #VPDebate

1328 2018-12-14 21:15:16 I use beard oil that must mean I’m also using makeup
1329 2018-12-14 21:15:15 Notice what happens to both the stock market and the CDN $ when the price of oil drops. The fact that AB would have sole control over our own resources would mean our new currency would likely equal that of the USA. The value of the CDN dollar would drop like a rock

How could I be so stupid to forget a sleazy lawyer who with 15 mins of fame thought he could be POTUS.

Agree on MBS, sanction SWIFT use for oil payments.

1339 2018-12-14 21:13:13 The Khashoggi murder directed by MBS.  Nations that do not have a free press are not free, and the US has been sticking it's head in the sand with regards to Saudi Arabia - first for oil, now for weapon sales - plus their promotion of Wahhabism. They are not friends of the US

1341 2018-12-14 21:12:57 You really need 2 read about the whale oil industry. The writing is upon the wall. Fossil fuels have about 50 years, maybe less, then like the whale oil industry it mostly extinct.

1346 2018-12-14 21:12:21 Are you aware that your cheap oil rhetoric hurts US economy
1347 2018-12-14 21:12:14 I know a lot of oil servicing firms that have not been able to continue their operations here in the South-South since your men came in....Couple that with the irreversible hike in the prices of staple goods.
1348 2018-12-14 21:12:11 @BreakfastNews 
That solar powered @GreenpeaceAP
ship in the Australian bite.
Why don't they sell that technology to shipping companies, make billions of $ & protect the worlds wildlife from oil shipping disasters such as the Exxon Valdez ?
1349 2018-12-14 21:12:05 Read the conversation online, talk about it offline. The best of both worlds. Love it.

As far as content, the data collected here is a treasure. If data is the new oil, Twitter is continuously adding to its reservoir.
1350 2018-12-14 21:12:03 Oil at $100= 18,000 Naira during PDP years
Oil @ $60 =  21700 naira during APC years
So basically APC are earning more than PDP
So where is our balance?
1351 2018-12-14 21:12:01 Thought for the day, its been so long since i contacted you, yet was flarted by every tweet to the public that went out. So as sucess go's may waves part on or distanal paths even though we share a shell oil relationship.

1355 2018-12-14 21:11:20 And after separation and the collapse of global oil it will depend on foreign aid and producing birch bark trinkets for sale to people taking the rarely used land route to B.C. on holidays. In other words, start diversifying the economy and end the nonsense

1362 2018-12-14 21:10:51 I don't need to do that bcos I know what is going on about it. He said subsidy but he didn't explain how it's been done. I zm5tellinv you what subsidy mean by this regime. You can go and research on it and tell me how many oil marketers Nigeria is paying today.
1363 2018-12-14 21:10:44 It looks like the #political class are in agreement that #Oil subsidy is enmeshed in corruption

1367 2018-12-14 21:10:23 I’m doing better today. Just the “migraine hangover”. 

I use Peppermint essential oil on my forehead and neck. If the pain just gets worse, I take my imitrex. Mostly I’m just “down” for a day.

1394 2018-12-14 21:07:49 top secret U.S. military assessment found that North Korea is still evading U.N. sanctions by transferring oil at sea, and that a coalition of U.S.-led forces deployed to disrupt the movements has failed to dent the overall number of illegal transfers, three U.S. officials Said.

1397 2018-12-14 21:07:18 Tell it to the markets, brainiac. WTI at $51. All indexes in full-blown correction. It’s a bloody mess. So why don’t you get off Twitter and get your ass in gear. You are helping crush the oil and gas industry and all equities. You’re poison. GET TO WORK!
1398 2018-12-14 21:07:17 Oh, come on, W.
No one "loves" pipelines or oil.
No one "loves" the oil sands.

People "love" the big salaries that come with them, and by "love" I mean "have grown accustomed to the comfortable lifestyle they offer, to the point where any criticism becomes heresy in their eyes."

1407 2018-12-14 21:06:55 No amount of regulation or competition needed to curtail oil production will be winnable through reform. Capitalism is not "buying and selling", it's a system of increasing focus of ever growing wealth into fewer hands. This leads to more disregard for the environment.

1410 2018-12-14 21:06:36 Yeah - how dare the NDP build schools, roads, and hospitals, to try to make up for decades of PC mismanagement. 
How about you explain why, if CT does nothing, the major oil companies are all in favor of carbon pricing?
1411 2018-12-14 21:06:29 I don't get it. Your house smells like fried food? Half the reason most people don't fry is the mess and lingering fry smell that after 20 minutes just smells like hot oil.

1421 2018-12-14 21:05:04 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
WTI trading has a huge embedded risk. That said, the return is likely the highest among all major markets. The main reason is due to the ultra-high volatility, high liquidity and $10 per tick.

My straight forward response is:

Marijuana has health benefits, more specifically the Cannabis Oils
(Fights Cancer & some brain/mental illnesses)

However, Smoking it still damages your lungs.

So Stick to the oil for health

1428 2018-12-14 21:04:00 America only buys 9%. The get 40% from Canada and could possibly get more.... so they don’t really NEED Saudi oil
1429 2018-12-14 21:03:54 Is it just me or does your car automatically drive better when you leave from getting the oil changed lol
1430 2018-12-14 21:03:53 Yeah but checking the oil level just is so basic that I’d expect it

1437 2018-12-14 21:02:37 Yes, my Dad’s wife is also highly allergic to shellfish.  That shit can kill you as you’ve sadly discovered.  My sister-in-law has mutating allergies - one year she’s allergic to canola oil and the next year canola oil is fine and she’s allergic to garlic.  Very bizarre.

1439 2018-12-14 21:02:01 The only name you can call it is subsidy but when you look at it, NNPC is doing everything. NNPC is the the owner of the crude and the one importing it, the difference is been taking care by NNPC which is different from when oil marketers are collecting it without importing
1440 2018-12-14 21:01:38 All of the 3 new picks are still a good shorting opportunity given how oil pruce is trending.

1443 2018-12-14 21:01:14 I've heard of someone removing the eyepieces and emptying a bottle of oil in the bino. And seen a 10x (air) giving ~12x magnification because of the beautiful oil meniscus on its front lens.

1446 2018-12-14 21:00:48 Sadly, prices don't go down on Nigeria. 
And for the repairs of the refineries, the cabals and Nigeria govt never wished it work.

Have you not seen how President BUHARI removed @IbeKachikwu from the oil system, so the cabals can have their ways.

1455 2018-12-14 21:00:19 Poppy seeds have a sweet, nutty flavor and are used as flavoring in breads, rolls, and cakes. They are also used to make poppy seed oil, which is used in cooking, artist's colors and soap.

1459 2018-12-14 21:00:03 Playing lickspittle to the Saudis is a dumb move. Old men like me are willing to see our sons and daughters fight to protect America. But we won't send them off to lower the price of oil a few cents or enable the military-industrial complex to keep selling arms to the Saudis.
1460 2018-12-14 20:59:49 America only has a few thousand troops in the area. What they do have is air power to back up the Kurdish militia they have been training. Question is will Trump back Kurds or Erdogan? Kurds have oil and the option of asking Putin for help. Erdogan is also talking to Putin.

The poor adhesion may also be attributed to oil on the PCB. Did you wipe the PCB down with 99% isopropyl alcohol?
1462 2018-12-14 20:59:38 your numbers may be correct, but neither coal nor crude from the oil sands has very much to do with your socalled global warming in the first place. Being supposedly educaated, you should come to that conclusion if you look at real historical figures instead of those spewed by ??

Some businesses deal with frying
1493 2018-12-14 20:56:51 During my lunch break I got a burrito, filled my car with gas, and had the oil changed in my car.
1494 2018-12-14 20:56:49 Welcome to Oil & Gas!
1495 2018-12-14 20:56:49 It's a corporate pattern, just like tobacco, big oil, chemical companies, etc.

Deny, deny, deny... until the company is compelled to share memos, internal reports, & other confidential documents.
1496 2018-12-14 20:56:49 Even if there was no climate crisis this is still a better alternative than dirty oil!
1497 2018-12-14 20:56:43 should i buy an essential oil diffuser for my cubicle at work like i’ve been wanting to for a week or is that Too Much
1498 2018-12-14 20:56:40 read your briefings, Kim is transferring oil in open waters to get around the sanctions.
LIES FROM YOU DAILY
1499 2018-12-14 20:56:31 What about the oil transfers? 
Kim Jong Un is just playing with your ego.
1500 2018-12-14 20:56:23 @ShepNewsTeam You handled the last 35 minutes like someone telling the truth. NO FOX BIAS  GOOD There must be tremendous pressure on you. Like Castor Oil Fox must be taken in wee doses
1501 2018-12-14 20:56:19 LMAO. Wetin u dey consider?!
1502 2018-12-14 20:56:07 Hang on Formula E uses battery power so no petrol and no oil, touch of grease perhaps or just more bloody virtue signalling 
1503 2018-12-14 20:56:06 Equalization will always be a contentious topic. But that’s not my hill to die on. Alberta’s strength is oil. Which benefits all of Canada (equalization, trade, jobs etc), historically our economy has always done better under conservatives especially at a provincial level.
1504 2018-12-14 20:56:05 Lol okay
1505 2018-12-14 20:55:57 drove my brothers truck to get an oil change and my heart is completely shattered.
1506 2018-12-14 20:55:53 A 2015 study by Lazard Bank showed the cost for electricity from wind and solar cheaper than coal, natural gas or oil! Why is Oregon slow to move to renewable energy? Governor Brown, please explain.
1507 2018-12-14 20:55:52 who wants to give me an oil change for free bc ya girl is dumb and doesn’t know how to change my own oil
1508 2018-12-14 20:55:40 cbd oil can help with so many ailments ! It's been an amazing addition to my health! #cbd

1509 2018-12-14 20:55:13 Brexiteer fantasies of the UK as “super Canada” or “Norway plus” are overlooking a common attribute of those two countries: oil.
1510 2018-12-14 20:55:06 Rosanne sleep aids, Kavanaugh drinking, Trump swamp oil.
1511 2018-12-14 20:55:00 Right?? Get you some Toasted Sesame Oil, I put that ish on errrythang
1512 2018-12-14 20:54:53 Thank God for Makin my face like this cuz i just got the deluxe package deal for my oil change for the L-O 
1513 2018-12-14 20:54:52 I don’t even know where to start (nor do I really want to, you’re obviously set in your rhetoric). You ask for an explanation of the carbon tax & are now talking E-Disposal Fees, Saudi Oil, Trevor Noah & parties on jets?!  It’s like u threw-up a bunch of @CPC_HQ catchphrases 
1514 2018-12-14 20:54:51 Of course we didn't need the FDA to tell us! Speaking of which, I am out of my Greek medicine...ahem Manoli Canoli Olive Oil! #wellness #foodismedicine
1515 2018-12-14 20:54:37 They recently discovered oil in Zimbabwe
1516 2018-12-14 20:54:33 I’ll definitely give 100% bob  lol,. Side bar the CBD oil has been great for my anxiety/depression, id love to chat with you soon about depression and anxiety!! Thanks for sharing your story it will definitely help people more then you will know!!!
1517 2018-12-14 20:54:27 With Tobacco companies, oil companies and now Johnson&Johnson being found to have covered up and suppressed science that showed harm to citizens, there needs to be a criminal law to pubish conspiracy to cause human, environmental & global harm @Ocasio2018 @JoeCunninghamSC
1518 2018-12-14 20:54:23 Don’t go by the sensor use the stick. Oil level sensors aren’t really the best and if they’re reading low it usually means -really- low.
1519 2018-12-14 20:54:21 My predictions 4 the 2020s

Lab grown meat will kill the current meat industry.

Oil industry will collapse as ppl switch to electric.

Self driving trucks put millions out of work.

Electric utilities crumble as they face millions of small competitors.

Sexbots are a thing.
1520 2018-12-14 20:54:09 His death is a huge oil lie.
1521 2018-12-14 20:54:04 Never any straight flights to Guyana  when they start extracting that oil in 2020 they will be though
1522 2018-12-14 20:53:52 Hey all you folks that just get in cars and drive please put antifreeze in your car and get an oil change if you need to
1523 2018-12-14 20:53:48 No wait. Two hours left to bring your food donation in and get a discount on your oil change.
1524 2018-12-14 20:53:45 Oil ends sharply lower for the week; natural-gas futures suffer worst weekly loss since 2016
Dec 14, 2018 at 2:45 p.m. ET
1525 2018-12-14 20:53:39 homeboy changing my oil is kinda cute
1526 2018-12-14 20:53:33 how about campaign finance reform so our politicians aren't feeding from big oil's tit?
1527 2018-12-14 20:53:29 Haha I feel you. It’s not that cheap. The hemp flower is a pretty good deal most of the time. But it helps me a ton with that and everything else. The oil is good for the gut biome
1528 2018-12-14 20:53:25 Currently own some starter positions in $TWLO, $SMAR, and $GRUB.  Also long some oil through futures.  Still mostly in cash at 88% of portfolio.  We'll see if this marks a short-term bottom in the market.
1529 2018-12-14 20:53:22 Acetone or mineral oil.
1530 2018-12-14 20:53:20 What about all that oil money?
1531 2018-12-14 20:53:14 This idea that this one journalist over everyone else The Kingdom has killed is responsible for crude falling is absolutely silly. #oil is always last to reprise falling growth and inflation.
1532 2018-12-14 20:53:11 Barnes & J.R. working better than they did in the Oil Baron’s Ball days... #SHUWBA
1533 2018-12-14 20:53:08 i'm gonna try that, thank u!! do you add any type of oil or product to it before you braid it? anytime i brush my hair i swear it's like 80% of my hair falls out it's so bad
1534 2018-12-14 20:53:01 i mean when ash cooks there's some smoke, whatever, oil smokes, but somehow i was the first to set the smoke alarm off and it only took me like 20 seconds
1535 2018-12-14 20:52:50 try Mac and Cheese with coconut oil instead of butter it’s lit
1536 2018-12-14 20:52:42 相変わらずの引きでなんとかなればいいんですけどね笑
1537 2018-12-14 20:52:41 TM used oil??? 
I need that number
1538 2018-12-14 20:52:39 Ya know that's the thing I did look but the ground is wet so if it's small I cant tell but the smell went away after a few minutes and the oil level sensor says it's pretty much full but I'll check it again later today.
1539 2018-12-14 20:52:23 Damn right I’ll use coconut oil instead of butter any chance I get
1540 2018-12-14 20:52:19 Crude oil settles sharply lower after weak China data, stronger dollar
1541 2018-12-14 20:52:15 @droid_life just watched your live stream. Are you people really that out of touch that you seriously don't understand why people in rural America would need more storage on their phones? I guess oil field workers, railroad workers and military don't count.
1542 2018-12-14 20:51:57 changing the oil? impeller broken?
1543 2018-12-14 20:51:55 With the lie wey osibanjo dey fire. As a pastor I don’t think you will be healed if he prays for you o. Better drink anointing oil and sleep
1544 2018-12-14 20:51:54 @atiku@PeterObi@POTUS 
APC is party of hypocrites:-
1. Kachikwu revealed $25Bn under table crude oil contract by GMD Nnpc
2 . NEITI Report on secret Oil Licenses renewal- Nigeria lost  $10bn
3 Ganduje $5m Bribery scandal
6.Oshiomole $55m Bribery scandal
Nigerians NO APC in 2019!
1545 2018-12-14 20:51:53 Good. Stop taking oil money and protecting Saudi interests, then.
1546 2018-12-14 20:51:43 Even when you do diversify... let's say you start an advertising agency. Well, likely you are going to have some oil business as clients, or clients that depend on the oil business. So if oil goes down - you suffer too.
1547 2018-12-14 20:51:41 Tanke is overrated
1548 2018-12-14 20:51:36 @FoxNews @marthamaccallum 
For the US to turn it’s back on the Saudis would be the worst policy EVER. Russia will sell them arms AND help them wipe Yemen off the map,much like they’re allowing Syria to vanquish Assad’s enemy’s. Look for oil to race to $100/barrel as Putin laughs.
1549 2018-12-14 20:51:06 Ok I just wanted to be sure because I'm pretty sure that LEGIT CBD oil still is classified as a controlled substance like marijuana...or am I wrong?
1550 2018-12-14 20:51:02 i cannot shower w/o incense, a candle, or an essential oil burning.
1551 2018-12-14 20:51:01 Lesser of three evils man. Harper was good for business. When oil was $100/barrel no one cared about it cause things were booming. Go ahead and equalize, we are a country after all. The issue now is that our economy isn’t great yet we are still giving when we could be fixing.
1552 2018-12-14 20:51:01 You should be, you should also be very proud for looking so well for a 300yr old lad, is it the oil of olay?
1553 2018-12-14 20:50:59 Quit Bragging then you dumb ass - you need to take a class on how to cut your use of adjectives in half. You’re a goddamn president of the United States not a snake oil salesman.
1554 2018-12-14 20:50:56 Right... because SOCIALIST CHINA raising 800 million people from poverty has nothing to do with that LMAO. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the number of people living in poverty in Russia increased by 70 million. Putin fixed it by NATIONALIZING oil and gas. Free markets? LOL.
1555 2018-12-14 20:50:41 NO, and not new. He's a sleazy conman which is what he was the day he was elected absolutely nothing new. He sold snake oil to the    rural uneducated and they lined up to buy it.
1556 2018-12-14 20:50:41 Cornstarch is a great alternative. Add a couple drops of your fave essential oils for scent. Just make sure you know the properties of the oil you're using. Rosewater, sandalwood and lavendar are (usually) quite body safe.  
1557 2018-12-14 20:50:28 Ahhh Dr Stukus... I think maybe I am allergic to spiced fireplace logs... every time we burn one... I get hungry, and then my eyes and my ears start to itch ... I tried essential oil (of sweet potato) but it doesn’t help...
1558 2018-12-14 20:50:25 We took lead out of gasoline...was that alarmist? Is mercury in ocean a good thing?  Why are you using so much time and energy trying to tell people that changing our oil economy is a waste of time? Burning oil creates emissions rhat contain C02. We can measure it, with science
1559 2018-12-14 20:50:25 Living in Oklahoma is a settler hellscape, it’s like the worst of the south and the Midwest rolled into one with heavy oil and gas propaganda everywhere.
1560 2018-12-14 20:50:22 I use the brand Bio Oil, it's a mineral oil I wash my face twice a day and then I use witch hazel toner and then I apply the mineral oil all over my face with a cotton round and it does its magic
1561 2018-12-14 20:50:20 I’m tryna vape some vegetable oil
1562 2018-12-14 20:50:13 You may have tried this... But it worked for my dog. Original Listerine, two caps and two caps of Baby Oil mixed with some water and spray liberally on her after a bath. Bathe her every day for a week and spray it after every bath. After 7 days our guy was fine.
1563 2018-12-14 20:50:02 I’ve seen this before but I get a bit confused bc is this just donors like the whole Beto and oil/gas thing? Or did Bernie take in pac money from healthcare?
1564 2018-12-14 20:49:56 Owen is my biggest fan and biggest hater  but let me not talk too much shit until after he get my oil changed
1565 2018-12-14 20:49:55 それもアリかと！
変な先入観無いとフラットな気持ちでやれるし( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
1566 2018-12-14 20:49:48 Thanks for agreeing - there's no easy answer. You have to take advantage of businesses that make money. Would it have been better for Alberta not get so heavily involved in the oil business? Absolutely not!
1567 2018-12-14 20:49:42 Note also that the USD is pegged only to oil, albeit other commodities correlate to some degree
1568 2018-12-14 20:49:40 Good to know. The successful fight against trans fats in 2005 only caused fast food chains #McDonalds etc to quickly switch to Palm oil for its zero trans fat. Hard to win against “big food”. #McDonalds frying oil formula after 2005 fight nowadays is as secret as #fracking fluid
1569 2018-12-14 20:49:39 When you go get your oil changed and the guy ask do you want vanilla mixed with that cherry #shotyourshots
1570 2018-12-14 20:49:30 Uh yeah I’m pretty aware that oil export exists currently thanks.
1571 2018-12-14 20:49:22 Obi keep referencing China, Singapore & co. Were those countries attain that heights by magic?
PDP failed to invest in infrastructure   16yrs with the highest crude oil price and you're blaming govt with largest investment in infrastructure in 2 budget cycle.
1572 2018-12-14 20:49:18 It picked me back up, dropped me to the ground, threw oil and set me on fire
1573 2018-12-14 20:49:10 I need tires and an oil change.
1574 2018-12-14 20:49:07 Just had a banana, blueberry, apple juice, peanut butter, raw hemp protein, whey protein, flax meal + raw coconut oil...  smoothie
1575 2018-12-14 20:49:05 oh!イル

1579 2018-12-14 20:48:52 Thank god fossil fuel production is so beneficial to the environment.

Alberta tar sands tailing polluting lakes, oil tankers or oil rigs sinking and polluting the shorelines, razing forests for coal extraction etc...
1580 2018-12-14 20:48:49 Close To The Grace - @KodakBlack1k Gotta Get On That Oil To Listen To That
1581 2018-12-14 20:48:31 The difference is that the subsidy is not been pa6 to oil marketers but everything is manage by NNPC.
1582 2018-12-14 20:48:30 Anyone have an oil heater for sale? Need ASAP
1583 2018-12-14 20:48:26 一応、良番に備えて下見したけど、どうなるかwww
1584 2018-12-14 20:48:16 started using argan oil for my skin... it lowkey smells like pepperoni grease
1585 2018-12-14 20:48:12 Of course. But the oil market has become accustomed to thinking that market laws do not apply to crude oil & that the sell side has some kind of Divine Right
1586 2018-12-14 20:48:06 Who are these Oil Barons? They are the retirement funds, personal 401k's, colleges, hospitals and the publicly held stock. We must keep these people in check. We cannot allow them to become too wealthy!
1587 2018-12-14 20:48:00 If you go into get an oil change and you leave with absolutely no oil in the car how far do you think you’d make it?  I made it further than I would have expected TBH
1588 2018-12-14 20:47:57 Oil always dominates the energy space headlines. But you need to know the price of #NaturalGas fell today by more than 7% #veryimportant
1589 2018-12-14 20:47:50 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
1590 2018-12-14 20:47:49 Don't blame him, he just squashed some bottles of Guineas

1594 2018-12-14 20:47:21 Yeah they dyed mine twice with very strong stuff and I did coconut oil treatment in between. I was like blonde/orange for a lil  but yeah I love my extensions and pieces too 
1595 2018-12-14 20:47:18 Is that going to be your problem?   The message was clear. We've got lots of sectors that should be subsidized but not the oil sector. That should fix itself. Cars are liabilities. Will always be bro
1596 2018-12-14 20:47:08 3/4 cup masoor daal, two to three cups of water, 3 cloves if garlic, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp salt, 3-4 round red chillies .. all togethet cook till daal has split and uniform.   Add greeen chillie and fresh dhaniya. For terka is butter oil, 1/4 onion pour over daal.
1597 2018-12-14 20:47:00 CHANGE THE TIRES ON YOUR CAR AND GET AN OIL CHANGE DAMNIT
1598 2018-12-14 20:46:53 It might sound dumb BUT — I had a full blown breakdown earlier because my Opa has always taken my car to get an oil change and I have to go do it by myself this weekend ... I love that man more than life and I am so happy that he is getting stronger and better everyday 
1599 2018-12-14 20:46:44 Errr annnnd she didn't. She got condescending claptrap when of course she is right .. when we have been sold some undeliverable snake oil we should have the right to decide whether we want it or not
1600 2018-12-14 20:46:31 I’m excited to see Jones play his first NHL game tonight! I’m hoping the Oil rally around this kid #letsgooilers
1601 2018-12-14 20:46:30 Funny thing is, Americans would consider me a libtard. But that aside, I think AOC has some serious catching up to do. 1. Nuclear is a part of the green new deal. and 2. Oil Barons and big manufacturers (GE / SIEMENS and the such) are already "energy barons" They own the market
1602 2018-12-14 20:46:27 The only hope at this point for Alberta is a new government., at least Jason has curbed the serious layoffs by capping oil production..
1603 2018-12-14 20:46:20 How about oil prices?
1604 2018-12-14 20:46:13 抽選で変に良番引くのがたぶん
辛いです...
1605 2018-12-14 20:46:01 Ok

Please answer this simple question...how do we measure pollution or emissions from burning fossil fuels? Also, the methane released from abandoned oil wells is being released by what industry? The electric/hydrogen car emits what? All plastics can be replaced by bioplastics
1606 2018-12-14 20:45:58 What Jamie??? Where s the olive oil?

1614 2018-12-14 20:45:00 crashes dont happen at extreme oversold levels and just about everything is massively oversold/if you are short spx/oil you are playing with fire at these levels.
1615 2018-12-14 20:44:42 Big lie, even when the economy was still in good shape i.e when the crude oil was selling at 140,160,  there were massive looting and grand corruption, why are you so forgetful?

1618 2018-12-14 20:44:30 apparently I suck at having cars and never put oil in it and damaged some valve or something and will cost me about $1500 to fix hello yes who needs a sugar baby!!!
1619 2018-12-14 20:44:13 BTW you are touching on very important issues here. But we need to break through the fads, snake oil, and fashions.
1620 2018-12-14 20:44:01 Learning how to change oil rn so twitter can get off my back 
1621 2018-12-14 20:43:51 Omg. I wish I could make fuel out of the rage I feel when I’m told I don’t deserve any opportunities as a #daca recipient. I’d big oil out of business.
1622 2018-12-14 20:43:37 They went into the Middle East to control that last reserves of oil
And they have no intention of releasing Free Energy Tech unless they can CONTROL it. Once we are indep of the power grid they lose CONTROL
Thats why Trump's uncle helped suppress Nikolas Tesla Free Energy #qanon

1628 2018-12-14 20:42:26 they like "black oil sun flower seeds" the best,
1629 2018-12-14 20:42:20 Personally I could not tolerate oregano oil or tea tree oil by mouth even in capsule form. They both caused major gastric irritation (reflux so severe I couldn’t swallow).
1630 2018-12-14 20:42:09 youtube poop: alex jones and elaine benes buy uncle phil's lamp oil
1631 2018-12-14 20:42:07 The oil is too much 
1632 2018-12-14 20:42:00 Someone just made +3.68% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 51.134 → 51.040 (20x leverage)  ~ AWWWWW $WTICO $USD
1633 2018-12-14 20:41:58 This "fact" sounds fabricated. I know Zimbabwean people have better sense than that... Also, what oil?
1634 2018-12-14 20:41:58 Canola oil Cafe
1635 2018-12-14 20:41:50 Bruh I’m really just trying to get my oil changed and the dude doing it tryna get w me liiike just fix my car so I can drive away from you
1636 2018-12-14 20:41:43 Some sort of oil slick leaking from the wetsuit
1637 2018-12-14 20:41:40 Talking about DIPS, I think TSLA stock will be known as the "BIG DIPPER" unless the democrats stop @realDonaldTrump from drilling in America for OIL!
Elon must pray every night for democrats to win everything in 2020 so they will re-join Climate Accord & stop drilling & fracking!
1638 2018-12-14 20:41:29 And a huge pile of oil and gas.  And no California, Vancouver, Washington DC, New York or Toronto.
1639 2018-12-14 20:41:28 Big lie at some point this year oil was $80 per barrel so where is the 60% less coming from @ProfOsinbajo doesn't know simple mathematics
1640 2018-12-14 20:41:11 Hijacked the EPA and filled it with big oil and anti-environment money men. SICK!
1641 2018-12-14 20:40:57 Peter Obi made my day, now I see the reason Anambra state was a shining  light under him, even when oil rich states were agitating against  payment of minimum wage, he payed and still left close to 5biilion for  Obiano.  This man is class on economic issues.
1642 2018-12-14 20:40:53 You guys should be proud of the 16yrs and be comfortable talking about Electricity that you gave us with over 21b USD,the good roads you gave us,the loans you obtained with 114 usd oil/barrel,the hospitals you built all over the country, the schools,rails and food productions.
1643 2018-12-14 20:40:51 Ladies- put coconut oil on your hair after you towel dry it!!!!! My hair is so softttttttt
1644 2018-12-14 20:40:48 Buying avocado oil – bij Walmart
1645 2018-12-14 20:40:26 It is extremely dangerous for all when politicians deny science in favour of political expediency. Sadly, Canada buys an oil pipeline and promotes the development of fossil fuel extraction, while pretending to be concerned about climate change.
1646 2018-12-14 20:40:24 A Wall wont stop drug/human traffickers flying into private runways
A Wall wont stop international 'students', anchor babies or rich foreigners buying their citizenship. Politicians ALWAYS leave backdoors
The Wall just stops Americans from leaving esp when the oil runs out #qanon
1647 2018-12-14 20:40:07 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。

1650 2018-12-14 20:39:44 A taste of schnapps and sweat with an aroma of tiki torch oil.
1651 2018-12-14 20:39:42 I am attempting to convince the richest families in the world that a depopulation plan will never work & working together is the only way to survive. This false scarcity Oil & War economy is going to end soon one way or another.
1652 2018-12-14 20:39:42 He has an entire, oil rich, nation of UAE giving him financial backing and his team are immune to FFP. They can break it's laws.

So in a way, yes.

Who is top of the league again at the moment?
1653 2018-12-14 20:39:42 This is the guy Marie Renauld promotes as an authority on oil and gas. Real slime ball, nobody in Calgary will publish him. He also recently said all the work Vivian Krause did was just conspiracy theories. He’s an NDP apologist hoping for a comms job.
1654 2018-12-14 20:39:40 This is not true. This govt is earning more. Deception seem to be the trademark of the APC . Oil earning is not only price, quantity is the main part. Production was far lower under the previous govt .due to security issues the.
1655 2018-12-14 20:39:15 Boil them in hot oil
1656 2018-12-14 20:39:13 I don't care if it's organic - I won't buy/eat anything knowing there's palm oil int it, organic or not.
1657 2018-12-14 20:39:12 Tryna get into the oil fields  who know people ???
1658 2018-12-14 20:39:05 they really brought in the embodiment of big pharma and big oil to come in and ramble
1659 2018-12-14 20:38:44 Arrival of Buhari.Seem you should look at what they call Macroeconomy,do you know how many countries went to recession and crude oil prices.
1660 2018-12-14 20:38:32 Try a face wash with black soap. Use witch hazel to tone & moisturize with a mixture of grapeseed/apricot kernel oil + lavender essential oil
1661 2018-12-14 20:38:26 Look at African Dictators and you will See what it means to be a G Spiritual Warlord and Supreme Ruler.

1663 2018-12-14 20:38:19 Probably should’ve applied this beard oil before I put on my turtleneck
1664 2018-12-14 20:37:51 A7 I use my Ipad for Pinterest quite a bit so it usually ends up with flour, oil and some other unknown ingredients all over it...#MobileLiving
1665 2018-12-14 20:37:48 Craving tacos! The ones with the fried tortilla that still has oil drippin from it when you take a bite while you hear that sexy crunch #OohhhSi
1666 2018-12-14 20:37:46 ซื้อหมดไม่ได้...แม่ยึดไปแล้ว 
1667 2018-12-14 20:37:44 To the President: Blame the Democrats?; blame yourself. Midnight Oil is playing on the radio. Get the message!!
1668 2018-12-14 20:37:42 There is a possibility , so how do they pay with oil which is not drilled
1669 2018-12-14 20:37:34 Isn't their other more important things to deal with? Like all the palm oil in everything we bloody buy.
1670 2018-12-14 20:37:33 Bet it tastes like snake oil. Suckers.
1671 2018-12-14 20:37:31 Not that I disagree with the idea - clearly taxes exist mainly for punitive reasons - but Norway does have a large oil extraction industry that is higher taxed than other Norwegian firms
1672 2018-12-14 20:37:31 I'm all for stopping palm oil or at least reducing it but what happens when you do it, will be replaced by far worse oils 
1673 2018-12-14 20:37:27 There is definitely a link. The most recent index point falls during the news about the dismal price of WCS that was hanging over the province in November. The highly point from earlier in the year corresponds to better (though still not great) prices for AB oil.
1674 2018-12-14 20:37:23 最初は勝ちを目指すけど無理と悟ればバカスロ開始予定www
1675 2018-12-14 20:37:20 This debate so far doesn't seem like it's being staged for a citizenry who can scoop oil from gutters as die-hard entrepreneurs 

Very interesting and touche at least between OBIdient and OSIBajo

Forget about Galatasaray, sorry, Galadima and company 
LMAO

1676 2018-12-14 20:36:55 Sara Eisen so happy and gleeful today with the market losing 500+.  WHY do you keep her on the network?  @cnbc
1677 2018-12-14 20:36:52 Finally; we hear from an oil company.
1678 2018-12-14 20:36:47 I’ve drenched my room in Lavender Oil and now I feel fucking sleepy
1679 2018-12-14 20:36:45 Hahaha - oil I soil and sand is sand. But proof of work is not an asset which backs bitcoin - its an expense! Why do bitcoiners always mix up expenses and assets? Yes right, because they do not understand economy LOL
1680 2018-12-14 20:36:41 Interested! Will it require eternal economic growth and subservience to the oil lobby?
1681 2018-12-14 20:36:40 Ik imma be crying on that oil tonight  fuck it, I’m ready to let it all out 
1682 2018-12-14 20:36:16 Strongly suggest we all avoid buying any product that contains palm oil
1683 2018-12-14 20:36:11 四散爆死だけは避けたいです...
1684 2018-12-14 20:36:10 Mix oregano and olive oil. Put it under your tongue. It’s nasty af but it’ll kick any cold you have
1685 2018-12-14 20:36:08 Went to get my oil change and my brakes were completely fine and then this bitch tells me I need to get my brakes fixed soon I should get it there all of a sudden my brakes are squeaking and shit I think I got played
1686 2018-12-14 20:36:07 I have left over stew really thick if I heat it I'll need to add water
#ShouldInoIshall cook it up in hot oil like hash browns with fresh onions is that hash?
A fried egg to boot? 
If your in the neighborhood stop by
1687 2018-12-14 20:35:58 I have to commend this government for reintroducing the crude oil swap for petrol. That is what previous governments before PDP adopted. It has to a great extent curb fraudulent practices associated with oil subsidies.
1688 2018-12-14 20:35:57 I remember before the illegal dumping, the oil spills. These things happened in my backyard, my hunting grounds. All in the name of short term greed.
1689 2018-12-14 20:35:55 The Yemen women and children dying of starvation is the responsibility of the entire world! Saudi Arabians need a lesson in world diplomacy! Saudi Arabians live in a sea of oil which has made them wealthier than most of the world! The United States of America love all people!
1690 2018-12-14 20:35:29 Ah OK, can't speak to its oil change interval too much then - my 06 Chevy Malibu goes maybe 6-8k miles in-between (on synthetic oil)
1691 2018-12-14 20:35:24 first bullish sign for oil at about 2pm massive bull hammer on 15 minute chart.
Oil is all about fed-if they cant understand after 30 plus % move down its about deflation even after opec cut production they the are beyond clueless!
1692 2018-12-14 20:35:17 Specifically which jobs are you talking about? Oil industry?
1693 2018-12-14 20:35:08 we saw how Europe acted in Bosnia war and watched the massacre where the lands left by ottoman years ago. Ww1 and ww2 also very civilized wars lived in history. European kingdoms brought civilization to Africa and South America's native people also. USA oil democracy in Mid East
1694 2018-12-14 20:35:00 It's very simple: In "Sexy Dance Healing," Bob's Burgers teaches us that if you hurt your back slipping on oil the local Capoiera teacher is pouring out, if you do the exercises he prescribes for you (to keep you from suing him), you earn different colored scrunchies. Simple.
1695 2018-12-14 20:34:57 皆んなで爆死しようぜ！(´◉◞౪◟◉)
1696 2018-12-14 20:34:54 Beauty grade castor oil applied with a cotton bud does the same thing and also works on eyebrows
1697 2018-12-14 20:34:51 I get so annoyed at how long they take for my oil change at Toyota yet I still never bother making an appointment lol
1698 2018-12-14 20:34:50 Your levels might be fine. Diets aren’t one size fits all. My numbers  when I did low carb/keto. I know people who say theirs dropped. I’m healthiest eating moderate complex carbs, lots of veggies,  plant protein, fish, and other omega3 fats, like olive oil. Good to check up.
1699 2018-12-14 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
1700 2018-12-14 20:34:17 楽しみで寝れません。

1702 2018-12-14 20:34:12 #Nutella dos'nt spread happiness, download a home recipe that won't contain palm oil and tastes better than the real thing
1703 2018-12-14 20:33:58 Damn forgot my oil 
1704 2018-12-14 20:33:52 Ppl paying $60+ for a full synthetic oil change while you won’t pay over $50 at Walmart
1705 2018-12-14 20:33:51 Yes o...white linen should beware of red oil.
1706 2018-12-14 20:33:49 What about us who spend our productive time queing for cooking oil, money, salt and fuel? You think is not abuse??? The taxes imposed on us, you think is not abuse? And remember this is daily abuse whilst Masiyiwa was only criticised once
1707 2018-12-14 20:33:48 wait  u DON’T put cbd oil in yr coffee every mornin ——  ?
1708 2018-12-14 20:33:48 Me neither.
But I never bought into it.

Just used oil for massaging up babies and then a bath n done

Cos I hated talc as a kid.
1709 2018-12-14 20:33:48 Try steaming ur face once or twice a week and put the tea tree oil in the hot water.. and wear face masks either clay or sheet but clay is recommended! 
1710 2018-12-14 20:33:08 Thank you, I love you. I may have to experiment and see what combo works. Like, I might be able to do rosemary essential oil and thyme herbs. or maybe a minty oil with another herb. I am gonna have to brainstorm this lol
1711 2018-12-14 20:33:01 There is no oil in zim
1712 2018-12-14 20:32:57 Why ?for the profit from oil and arms sales of course
1713 2018-12-14 20:32:55 Vote for disaster or #PDP?  They were on power when oil was booming but they couldn't do anything solid until now?  Are you really serious?
1714 2018-12-14 20:32:46 Walmart aware how much faster oil changes would go, if 4 of the 6 mechanics weren’t sitting at the front desk talking about Star Wars. #theywantmoremoney #useless #deserveminimumwage
1715 2018-12-14 20:32:46 I thought it was more like 35% but if you have completed but not producing wells you can tie them in, you can also drill new ones that dont make the returns but do generate free cash flow in first year. I do think oil will bottom early next year though, WTI around $40 possibly.
1716 2018-12-14 20:32:22 Want to bend her over and bury my face between her cheeks, taste the sweat and suntan oil and arse, wanking like a bastard.
1717 2018-12-14 20:32:17 You’re okay with NK circumventing sanctions by continuing to perform ship-to-ship oil transfers? Of course they’re okay. You’re weak.
1718 2018-12-14 20:31:44 Do you have any background knowledge of Oil price dynamics?  What controls the price of crude oil?
1719 2018-12-14 20:31:44 A6: My best dish would have to be grilled chicken over angel hair pasta with lemon, olive oil and red pepper flakes.  #MobileLiving
1720 2018-12-14 20:31:40 "When oil was at $100 per barrel, there was no infrastructure, now, we are spending more on infrastructure with 60% less earnings" - VP @ProfOsinbajo ... #VPDebate #2019Debate
1721 2018-12-14 20:31:28 He's in a twisted, little, nasty world of his own. One day, people who fell for his lies will realise he is simply a snake oil salesman feathering his own nest.
1722 2018-12-14 20:31:26 Trump is the opposite of that!!  He hires oil industry people to oversee the environment he hires banking CEO’s to oversee the finance department.  HE IS THE SWAMP
1723 2018-12-14 20:31:25 Hm okay so lotion and oil?
1724 2018-12-14 20:30:46 I invented it especially for you: cauli grated like couscous, pressed into a base with a little linseed oil and topped with apple slices etc.

Who knows, we might end up on Dragon's Den and all your problems will be over!
1725 2018-12-14 20:30:30 I gave up charting ETFs, except for oil, and $GLD?

1728 2018-12-14 20:30:22 Do you have any background knowledge of Oil price dynamics?  What controls the price of crude oil?
1729 2018-12-14 20:30:11 same bro! i usually run out of oil at the worst times on hwy 501 like when i’m out running errands and shit. Like COME ON 
1730 2018-12-14 20:30:09 ...and I’m far more concerned with getting oil to market (to ocean) in a heavily regulated, safe way that plans for inevitable evolution to green industry than I am about mountain weather.
1731 2018-12-14 20:30:06 Its a miracle the LNG got thru and right after a big one was lost.  3 pipelines lost due to social justice nonsense. In the long run, all the oil will be extracted by future govts for great reward to the country.  Shame to wait and current suffering
1732 2018-12-14 20:30:04 You're getting shafted on the amount of profit you get from your oil. You get what Nigeria gets, & the world knows they're getting ripped off.
1733 2018-12-14 20:30:00 Someone just made +2.89% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 51.134 → 51.060 (20x leverage)  ~ AWWWWW $WTICO $USD

WTI has had a very ugly plunge today. If you have the fears, it's normal but if you are scared, it's abnormal.
1738 2018-12-14 20:29:17 My guess would be gov owned media. 

Same is happening in Hungary, Turkey, etc. They didn't have oil, but cheap credit. Now credits dried up, the mismanagement is more apparent, so they're blaming the "foreign powers" 24/7. Half the public believes it. They need to, to stay sane.

1742 2018-12-14 20:29:03 I'm gonna try to find out what kind of smells they like. They're a very earthy person, so maybe they'd be fine with some basil & an essential oil !
1743 2018-12-14 20:29:03 Thank you  for your words and passion Greta. Solidarity from the petro-metro. Even in the belly of the oil & gas industry, people are listening to your words. #ChangeIsComing
1744 2018-12-14 20:29:03 Cbd oil is essential
1745 2018-12-14 20:28:49 That’s because coconut oil and olive oil are used to seal in moisture so they need to be paired with a moisturizer then it’ll lock it the moisture and prevent dryness.
1746 2018-12-14 20:28:42 It already did. It picked oil 40+ years ago.
1747 2018-12-14 20:28:34 Nice reflection. I agree with you it's a human right thing. Unfortunately, policies about clean water, etc are not popular. It's always economic policies that are important for the people (coal mines, oil corporations & natural gas extraction sites) which are dangerous for people
1748 2018-12-14 20:28:33 But when people come together to combat climate change, he's worked with oil & gas companies to leak methane.

Said yes twice, before I asked if they understand.  They say, "little bit". 

Why the hell do you hire in your stores?!?

1754 2018-12-14 20:28:15 I agree-but congress has done very little and I don't see anymore done-Trump has too many ties with the country and he wants to keep the U.S. selling planes there, despite what the Saudi regime does-and let's not forget all the oil...

1762 2018-12-14 20:27:03 I bought a lavender oil & I slept so fucking good last night ughhhhh
1763 2018-12-14 20:27:02 I wonder if celebrities get oil changes
1764 2018-12-14 20:27:01 Go ahead - U don't even understand transfer payment system, why the current drop in Oil prices, why the previous downturn... in fact, what DO U understand? Besides rudeness, threats, insults?
1765 2018-12-14 20:27:00 And how would separating help expensive to refine oil get to the sea? Do you think separating means literally cutting Alberta out of Canada & floating off into the ocean?
1766 2018-12-14 20:26:56 I think that’s what’s going on in AB and why oil still has social license to pollute. The old AB adage “pls god let there be another oil boom and I promise not to puss it all away”...just let me fix the financial mess I’m in believing I’d have this high paying job forever.
1767 2018-12-14 20:26:55 My mom is 8 THOUSAND miles late on her oil change and I’m stressed
1768 2018-12-14 20:26:53 It depends whether or not A) they have oil, and B) if they're up-to-date on their "donations".
1769 2018-12-14 20:26:42 Money managers have cut their bullish Nymex WTI crude oil bets by 8,638 net-long positions to 119,675, weekly CFTC data on futures and options show.

1778 2018-12-14 20:25:48 Even if you are allowed not to pay wages , you will still not be able to produce sufficient cooking oil. You do not have raw materials and you expect to be competitive.
It is this wrong advice you give politicians which comes back to hit you then you complain.

1790 2018-12-14 20:24:03 The lastest I had from the CFO of NNPC is that no fresh subsidies are being paid to oil marketers. This administration is settling backlogs of N2.2 trillion naira inherited from past government. The scheme in place now is crude oil swap for petrol.
1791 2018-12-14 20:24:02 mazi may your oil keep flowing
1792 2018-12-14 20:23:56 Well my old man is a lifelong fisherman and an anti environmentalist. HE says that salmon fishing should be stopped or reduced for 2 cycles. 7-14 years. This is a man who will bilge pump oil and gas into the ocean and toss full garbage bags.

But, I have literally never seen any Democrat advance Venezuela as an ideal model.  But also, we should resist gun control.  Especially, now.  #NWO

1798 2018-12-14 20:23:32 If M4A becomes a thing then many new governmental jobs will be made. As for oil and gas industry, their jobs will be replaced with new green energy jobs. I don't know what could replace the Vermont jobs. Top-down reform is needed. I definitely see your point though.
1799 2018-12-14 20:23:30 It's more likely than not, Oil continues to plunge....
1800 2018-12-14 20:23:03 #2019Debate

1. These questions are straight forward but debate performances have disappointed me.

2. Avg oil price was c. $61 btw 1999-2015.

$100 for 16 yrs is a lie.

The military left $5.5b in foreign reserves 

3. Are Govt-funded adverts during debates legal and/or ethical?

1805 2018-12-14 20:22:21 And oil.
1806 2018-12-14 20:22:20 I’ve asked this a hundred times to all parties. So what is the plan then. It’s easy to say no ,but much harder to say hey how about instead of taxes we do this instead. I keep asking show leadership, show me a better way please . And I support Canadian oil .

1832 2018-12-14 20:18:16 Unless incentives are put in place to encourage that avenue. Green energy is a start but there is no easy answer. But focusing on just oil and wheat is also not the answer, which Alberta seems to constantly focus on.

Because it has more value that way. If you don't know why, that is something else you can study and learn.

1891 2018-12-14 20:11:40 That money was theirs. They delivered all that crude oil to us and then we didn’t pay for it. We froze the funds until everything was cleared. Now the money belongs to them. We don’t get to dictate how they spend it no matter how much it makes us unhappy.
1892 2018-12-14 20:11:20 If you haven’t tried Jamaican black caster oil, you should. But get the one from target in the brown glass bottle. It’s super thick and I would just put it on my ends while I’m twisting it/at night and it definitely helped them not break and maintain moisture

1900 2018-12-14 20:10:30 There's never been a shortage of cannabis until it became legal. The same people that were consuming prior to Oct 17 are still the same people consuming now. Something wrong here. Is this purposeful created for beaurocrats to control supply and demand? Just like Oil...OPEC of POT
1901 2018-12-14 20:10:28 On Kraft Mayo the second ingredient after water actually is Olive oil...so that's better.
Mayo is essentially oil and eggs,no reason it can't be good fat/protein and low carb.

1910 2018-12-14 20:09:53 You could probably get the recipe.  The fava beans can just be dry roasted in a frying pan on your stove top, red pepper can be roasted right on the burner.  Rest just goes in a food processor.  The trick is getting the good quality ingredients.  Olive oil is a lottery.
1911 2018-12-14 20:09:51 1. No. 
2. Resources are not something we run out of, they are stuff that once was a nuisance, garbage (oil, tungsten f.ex.), we found a way to to use, and eventually swap for something better (synthesized fuel out of water, CO2 and abundant energy, f. ex). 
3. No.
1912 2018-12-14 20:09:38 A race of electric cars in a state that’s built on oil. Kinda ironic, isn’t it? :)
1913 2018-12-14 20:09:30 Anyone have thoughts on 80 yr old woman doing keto? App has no risk factors (she claims she does not have dyslipidemia.) IS overweight. She's drinking 'bullet coffee' (butter + oil) and says it makes her feel really bad after. But she's lost 2-3 lbs and want to keep on...

1915 2018-12-14 20:09:20  honestly I put cocoa butter and castor oil on them
1916 2018-12-14 20:09:20 Okay I just looked it up and it said that the oil that the necklaces contain will be absorbed by the kid and be an anti inflammatory —> less pain. It has the same kinda vibe as essential oils to me so do what you will with this info.
1917 2018-12-14 20:09:19 Your neat word for the day: petrichor

Petrichor is the distinct scent of rain in the air. Or, to be more  precise, it’s the name of an oil that’s released from the earth into the  air before rain begins to fall.

1920 2018-12-14 20:09:04 And he said, ""Ajaokuta Steel Oil Company"

This is slap to the course I studied in school.

Finally, this agbada man has killed Oby Ekwesili's career..

I dread to think what they will try to get away with to keep scots oil and gas.
We have to indy quick and not let them delay like the did to Irish.
They cant be allowed to do that to Scotland
1925 2018-12-14 20:08:22 Why we are far from China:

OBJ and Atiku were competing for d most corrupt for 8years.

Peter Obi was in d economic management team of GEJ, era of oil boom but he was dead silent while they all plundered us into recession.

1926 2018-12-14 20:08:19 You know this how? He got hammered by Ted Cruz for wanting an extra 10% on every barrel of oil. He ran is campaign with only small donors and no superPAC money. By your reasoning I would say since you're from Quebec, all you want is equalization money from other parts of Canada.

1930 2018-12-14 20:07:50 Kindness is the oil that makes the world go around.
1931 2018-12-14 20:07:40 We are majorly dependent on oil as long as that remains our economy is as good as the global price of oil.

"Major economic something for Nigeria"


1935 2018-12-14 20:07:17 How many have died since , the country is still in chaos , yet you see Saudi kill there own and we supply arms , ots all money making ,they are all barbaric countries , with oil .
1936 2018-12-14 20:07:02 Matthew, you need to look at who is lying to you. You need to look at a map too. There's plenty of propane suppliers much closer than Oklahoma. There's roads and rail to bring heating oil to the U.P. Line 5's primary purpose is carrying crude to Canadian refineries, not propane.
1937 2018-12-14 20:06:36 Look at Norway, they have something like a 60% royalty on oil. Companies still drill there, still make money, while the country makes a fortune. They then used that money to build a healthy economy where every second car sold today is an EV, lots of Tesla's, cos they can...

1946 2018-12-14 20:05:36 I hope you can bring some change there. In Presidential Elections, Trump about how Saudi-Arabia was actually involved in 9/11. (Regarding the lost son of Osama as fake conspiracy). But then when he became President, the oil become to important. Why would that change with you?
1947 2018-12-14 20:05:35 @rozita_lotfi,
what a direct and clear viewpoint and stand from one of BBC member.
I am wondering what great interest is in saving the corrupted state in Iran.
I am sure such people paid directly from dollars  made from Iranian people oil export. @BBC
1948 2018-12-14 20:05:31 I had similar issues when I started, but discovered it was due to my body getting used to coconut oil, when I reduced it and reintroduced more gradually, I had no issues
1949 2018-12-14 20:05:28 We will not depend on oil alone. We will focus on diversifying the economy of Nigeria.

1951 2018-12-14 20:05:18 People in the #Oil industry who are constantly mad about losing their jobs don't seems to grasp that having a habitable planet on which to live is also an important part of job security.
1952 2018-12-14 20:05:12 also use jojoba oil and vitamin e oil on your face to moisturize at night. i know it seems counterproductive but it cleans your pores and makes your face produce less oil. also change your pillowcases and sheets regularly!
1953 2018-12-14 20:05:10 Snake oil sales are up in 2018, 2019 looking even better!
1954 2018-12-14 20:05:06 Because then, the prices of crude oil is much more, and the previous government didn't make good use of it. Good price, yet we Import rice for billions of naira.
1955 2018-12-14 20:05:05 Oil money in Nigeria can make anyone do anything including bloggers giving “in” something unique, sweet, dreams, breath, light , and things .....what were you thinking about ? You are “warn” 
1956 2018-12-14 20:05:01 I have to agree with you on that .
1957 2018-12-14 20:04:53 They make a drink like that at the beach bars in Bermuda. It's called Shark Oil, it's basically a Long Island Iced Tea on steroids.
1958 2018-12-14 20:04:52 How can you budget more money to subsidy than education, agric etc in a country that produces oil?
Obi.

1959 2018-12-14 20:04:51 Interesting the CEO of $CJ.TO (which I added today here today in this little collapse) just bought yesterday 100k shares in the open market, with all the nightmares of #oil and Alberta laid out in front of him.
1960 2018-12-14 20:04:50 We very well could have a depression, most likely caused by a focus on a failing market(example: oil) we would not be prepared for this and most likely homelessness and depression would skyrocket as well as debt

1963 2018-12-14 20:04:35 Just asked my neighbor to borrow some vegetable oil for brownies and her husband said “what, are you making bud brownies?” I responded “no I wish” and they chuckled... now I’m not sure if they’re pot heads or if that was a trap...
1964 2018-12-14 20:04:27 Man knacked her as a poor man, pregnanted and dumped her as a Billionaire oil magnate

1965 2018-12-14 20:04:23 Price of oil has dropped and that is our major source of income. Does that make your economy look good? I wish some of your were in the president's shoes.
1966 2018-12-14 20:04:15 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.

1970 2018-12-14 20:03:54 We need an Obama intervention. @realDonaldTrump killing markets and economy. Oil prices dropping is a good indicator of how much damage @realDonaldTrump has done to the economy which will soon be felt. @CNBC @foxandfriends

Saddam was murdering his people: industrial homicide on our screens nightly; what do you do? The idea it was just for the oil is pure conspiracy theory & as to cannon fodder our troops crushed his
1975 2018-12-14 20:03:30 Only if you keep it next to your stove and accidentally splash oil on it, not that I would know anything about that at all...! 
1976 2018-12-14 20:03:23 Why is the gold being mined not reflected in our revenue as oil is?
1977 2018-12-14 20:03:21 CLE, MN, ApptSt, 54
1978 2018-12-14 20:03:17 Cost of the refineries and the small amount of oil processed you almost get a 10 to 1 ratio of just building an oil export line. You would still need a product pipeline. As vehicle efficiency continue to increase there is no incentive to build more cap for Cdn market = pipeline
1979 2018-12-14 20:03:13 Electric cars are the wave of the future. Trump wants us to use the combustible engine for all time destroying the environment, making the country depends on oil.  Electric cars are propelled by 1 or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries. BACKWARDS!?

1982 2018-12-14 20:02:53 Obi just talked about ICT without mentioning the blockchain

1985 2018-12-14 20:02:40 It's almost 2020. We barely have 8 hours of electricity a day, we export crude oil and import its refined product. We have a non existent railway infrastructure, no government owned airline, minimum wage is still 19800, a dollar is over N360 naira.

1995 2018-12-14 20:01:32 Things not going well? Talks for denuclearization deal appeared to have stalled, in part to disagreements over the timing of sanctions relief. U.S.-led forces have failed to stop illegal oil transfers from N.K., which is evading sanctions from the U.N. by transferring oil at sea.

2001 2018-12-14 20:00:47 Not enough local demand for a refinery.  Otherwise there would be more of them in Canada.  GDP is not a good indicator of the value of produced goods or new wealth.  No country in their right mind would keep resources locked up.  EV battery production needs a lot of oil.

2010 2018-12-14 20:00:18 Here in the USA, it seems like the "political climate", the "social climate" and the actual environmental climate, mix about as well as oil and water. Most unfortunate.
2011 2018-12-14 20:00:00 Our focus has been on coal, partly ignoring gas, and totally ignoring oil. Great for the oil producers. Public energy production is the easiest fossil fuel usage to tackle but realistically we need to be reducing consumption of ALL fossil fuels.

2017 2018-12-14 19:59:30 The reason isn't too complex. These things take a long time to build nd repair.

2024 2018-12-14 19:58:36 Well you do have to look at your own faults before pointing out someone else’s i don’t buy from unsustainable palm oil products nor do I buy any of Nestlé bc Nestlé thinks no one has a right to clean water.

2028 2018-12-14 19:57:41 @AlbertaatNoon your guest is making a straw man argument about the hypocrisy of environmentalists and still benefit from oil. We complain because society has not given options and big oil has actively lobbied against alternatives.

2035 2018-12-14 19:57:24 Are things really as bad for $SLB as in 2009? Stock is lower than when Oil was $26, and is approaching March 2009 lows of $35.19 @jimcramer
2036 2018-12-14 19:57:21 3 oil rig toffees for a penny. No wonder I've so many fillings
2037 2018-12-14 19:57:11 And yet they are still importing oil right under your nose sanctions mean nothing to them or you. Resign now
2038 2018-12-14 19:57:08 The total count of drilling rigs currently active in the U.S. falls by 4 to 1,071, says Baker Hughes' latest weekly survey.

The U.S. oil rig count also slides by 4 to 873, following a 10-rig decline last week, while gas rigs hold steady at 198.
2039 2018-12-14 19:57:04 This thc oil, was far better outta the cartridge in meh chalice, than it was in the cartridge with the pen
2040 2018-12-14 19:57:02 That's the world we live in, a world run by big corporations and their puppet politicians. Those 2 million people died so the military-industrial complex could get big contracts, and the oil companies got their share of the spoils too. war profiteering scumbags with no morals.

2042 2018-12-14 19:56:53 Fact #Nigeria is the only oil producing country in the world that imports petroleum. This is really laughable
2043 2018-12-14 19:56:51 It was edict last Sunday at google church (from the temple of the biological mysticism)...come on Alan you've got to eat more sugar to keep your focus up during the indoctrination sessions. What... have you been eating coconut oil again:)
2044 2018-12-14 19:56:47 Not if you are a consumer who works in the field, and lives in a state whose economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas...
2045 2018-12-14 19:56:47 The oil mafia is responsible for it's failure . Artificial shoratge is caused by them . It's always chepaer than petrol and can be imported
2046 2018-12-14 19:56:39 We shouldn't be important products of a produce we sell. We should be refining the oil we reduce, to take advantage of the by-products ~ ANN #2019Debate #VPDebate
2047 2018-12-14 19:56:29 If correct (which I doubt) US/Obama trumped it with the 5 year #TransitionthroughGas support/manipulation of the oil price which freed US from Saudi who switched from Petro$ to Petro€ in response  accommodated by ECB QE. Amazed anyone believed ECB bullshit about 'stimulus'
2048 2018-12-14 19:56:22 Please send prayers, I ask for lots of prayer in my time of need. 

My scalp needs to be oiled. I am about to succumb to the lack of oil in my hair, fall out in the middle of the floor in my office, omg. Idk if I can make it until close. Just send the prayers.
2049 2018-12-14 19:56:18 The major driver for #IndustrialEthernet is the increasing demand for connectivity across all sectors including #Airlines, #Factories, #Manufacturing, #Mining, oil exploration, power grids, railways and utilities... Don't forget #5G for #IndustrialAutomation

2051 2018-12-14 19:56:08 Unemployment rate in Nigeria is 80 percent, secondly, how can a country that have oil, export d oil and import the refine product, and they say they are subsidize petroleum product, this politicians are wekid
2052 2018-12-14 19:55:39 We will invest in Private Public Partnership (PPP).     We will ensure more refineries are built, and make the oil sector transparent enough, so that the common man will understand  what is going on- ANN #2019Debate

#2019Debate
2054 2018-12-14 19:55:14 More refineries should be built blah blah blah... When NDA where bombing oil facilities and contributing immensely in our downfall you are suggesting more refineries... Does she even reside here in Nigeria #2019Debate
2055 2018-12-14 19:55:12 except when he was selling oil and iron to Germany after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.
I'm glad that communist parties around the world have people like you in their midst, because it means that they're not getting smart and they'll stay out of power.
2056 2018-12-14 19:55:11 - Fracking releases GHGs

- Oil business has polluted in Alberta; not cleaned up yet 
- Albertans pay less tax than Québecois 
4/4 are true. Where are the myths? #cdnpoli knows the truth.
2057 2018-12-14 19:55:09 Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop

He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a' standing
On the radiator grille....
2058 2018-12-14 19:55:07 I just spent 100$ dollars at this oil change place they always talking a nigga into shit
2059 2018-12-14 19:55:07 Quite. 
Also great time to try out some South East Asian delicacies, starved dead rats. 

On oil industry and more, management will soon received assistance from our Socialist Chinese comrades. "Exploitation" is one of their best core competencies.
2060 2018-12-14 19:55:02 Comfrey Oil or cream the old English name is Knitbone good for injuries and ligament damage, also used for bruises @LeedsMarkets @MarketRedirected
2061 2018-12-14 19:55:02 we must sit down to adequately tackle the possible source of subsidy which is why we need modular refineries to strengthen the dead refineries and privatize the existing ones for better optimum performance in the oil and gas sub sector of our economy
2062 2018-12-14 19:55:01 Have you ever met someone who smells like vegetables? And I don’t mean smelling like a good ol veggie stir-fry but someone who smells like raw green beans 

Could be a new Saje essential oil who knows
2063 2018-12-14 19:54:57 I fight it with so much coconut oil
2064 2018-12-14 19:54:56 Then we need to support manufacturing. Are we just going to depend on oil and import things?? Including oil products?
2065 2018-12-14 19:54:54 I disagree it's cheap clean fuel , if there is a shortage we can always import it. It's the Oil Mafia that's causing it . U should be talking about who is responsible for mismanagement
2066 2018-12-14 19:54:52 Environmentalists keep DemocRATS in power along with the Illegal Alien votes.
Not 1 new REFINERY allowed here in Commiefornia in nearly 50 years. No drilling for oil.
Yes. It's citizen voters own fault for voting for  (D)

2069 2018-12-14 19:54:26 There is no transparency in the oil sector. We will ensure that more refinery are built. Diversification is not negotiable in our government. - @feladurotoye deputy, Khadijah Abdullahi-Iya.

2076 2018-12-14 19:53:30 It's only called "extra virgin olive oil" if it's grown in the extra virgin region of France
Otherwise it's called Liberal Democrat olive oil
2077 2018-12-14 19:53:28 Transfer payments are the way of keeping Quebec in the federation. How much do they get and why do they get so much, don't except they are a "have not" province? We are paying Quebec to buy Saudi oil. Just look at Ultramar refinery.

Is clarified butter just Cow Essential Oil?
2082 2018-12-14 19:52:40 Hbb just stick them in the microwave for 15 minutes with a drizzle of olive oil. It works just as well. Make sure to prick them with a fork multiple times on both sides though because they’d explode from heat induced internal pressure otherwise

2085 2018-12-14 19:52:38 Yes, let talk about the oil.
2086 2018-12-14 19:52:37 A lot of those MLM essential oil companies have brain washed their sellers into believing THEIR essential oils are “so pure” that there’s no way anyone can have a negative reaction to them. Despite the fact that anyone could be allergic and some are known to poison pets.

2092 2018-12-14 19:52:16 I believe  the incentive is value added -  jobs, crude residue, petrochemical  industry etc. 

We won't sell oil at discounted price to local guys.
2093 2018-12-14 19:52:07 I’d check under the car after it’s been parked for a bit to see if you can find any fresh oil on the ground. And check the oil level as well

This shows trumps inability to maintain economic pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal.
2133 2018-12-14 19:48:24 Our government should have known about this and put a stop to it.  Another fail.  I’m sure it’s not the only campaign against oil and gas in Canada. Look at the easy coast when it comes to shale oil and gas. Insane.

2150 2018-12-14 19:45:56 Just checked which of my Christmas choc"s contain Palm Oil. They are going straight back to the shop tomorrow
2151 2018-12-14 19:45:54  If was all over the news last month that your discovered oil reserves
2152 2018-12-14 19:45:30 That’s what we used for everything growing up! Warm olive oil for an earache works wonders! 
2153 2018-12-14 19:45:20 It was our Country who gave him arms , well before Iraq war , it was about the oil , our troops where just cannon fodder .
2154 2018-12-14 19:45:18 It's so annoying the ypp vp candidate don't know much about subsidiary and the oil sector of the country..the major theft on our oil sector are perpetrated by the nupeng,Son,Dpr,ppmc and pppra and Apc govt ..These are the major oil theft feasting on the subsidy money  #2019Debate
2155 2018-12-14 19:45:16 Definitely lost the plot while sleeping on the mountain did our Rip Van Winkle.
The Middle East wars were never about the oil.
They were and are about protecting the Petrodollar Mechanism and the FIAT US$ demand and thus value.
2156 2018-12-14 19:45:11 There are no factories in Canada now (or planned) to build EVs.  Oil industries employs highly educated engineers, surveyors, etc.  And it will be a hundred years before EVs will work in rural winter Canada, if at all.
2157 2018-12-14 19:44:56 Ну, хз тогда.
2158 2018-12-14 19:44:33 can I bottle up the oil from my face? there's way to much of it
2159 2018-12-14 19:44:29 And out of business if it wasn't for corrupt oil money by sugar daddy.

We are subsidizing oil 
- Prof Osinbajo

Question:
Who're we paying the subsidies?
2162 2018-12-14 19:44:24 He made your debt, your oil.
2163 2018-12-14 19:44:20 Do you think if I ask nicely [redacted1] will set me up with [redacted2] like a Renaissance-era courtier bringing a portable oil painting of one monarch to another monarch and asking if they are pleased with the idea of marrying them
2164 2018-12-14 19:44:17 I want to bathe in a mixture of gravel and olive oil
2165 2018-12-14 19:44:16 Longest oil change in life 
2166 2018-12-14 19:44:13 That's what the latest NK story is about, that they have been buying the heating oil secretly. And Trump says he doesn't care, so, I reckon they will get all the oil they need.
2167 2018-12-14 19:43:59 I’m not a huge essential oils fan at all, but I had a 4 days headache just like you’re describing and I put peppermint oil on my temples and a tiny bit on my forehead and it actually helped! Hope you feel better girl!!

2170 2018-12-14 19:43:48 THIS. I’m allergic to lavender and so many lotions and essential oil blends have lavender in them. 
2171 2018-12-14 19:43:42 Although that is terrifying thought I do get nervous cooking naked mainly because of the oil splatter I dont want 3rd degree burns on my dick
2172 2018-12-14 19:43:15 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

Me: pizza grease
2174 2018-12-14 19:43:10 You should also understand or go and read about subsidy before 2015 and now. Government is no more paying oil marketers.
2175 2018-12-14 19:42:57 Our Constitution is written on Cannabis Hemp,  Navy Sails word Canvas comes from Cannabis Hemp,  Rope etc.  Resin farmers used 4 fuel,  tractors why did they need Gasoline? Oil crisis solved but over their Dead bodies
2176 2018-12-14 19:42:53 I'd like to see them sign both.  Cam really hasn't been good for two years, and I think he might be perceived in a group of goalies that aren't going to get you where you need to go, so teams won't throw big $ at him.  Might make him affordable as a two for Oil.
2177 2018-12-14 19:42:44 cocoa butter > coconut oil
2178 2018-12-14 19:42:42 I was trying out a new body butter. I noticed it was made in Colombia. I'm more than half expected to see hemp oil in the ingredients, but nope. Lol
I usually don't see a lot of products from Colombia, especially cosmetics.

2184 2018-12-14 19:41:40 A few years ago I started cooking with oil instead of butter and I just cooked with butter again and like butter is so good and honestly it does not get enough credit

2192 2018-12-14 19:40:40 is there oil on the stick?  there should be; there will be a mark telling you WHERE the oil should reach.If its way below that U need oil.  Having enough oil is very imp!  if you run out of oil, your engine will seize & Ur car is dead unless U put in a new engine.
2193 2018-12-14 19:40:37 @tinymixtapes thank you guys for finally giving immaterial the recognition it deserves as the best track off of Oil of every pearl

2230 2018-12-14 19:37:20 I’ll say it again: Exxon is only around because people use the product. If the demand stopped, they would discontinue pulling oil out of the earth.  They are not the ones burning it, you are.

2290 2018-12-14 19:30:59 I will say partly true. Cost of crude pays a large role in pump price of oil. Unless, we want to sell oil price at discounted price. I  agree that it can be N25 less than what it is, when imported.
2291 2018-12-14 19:30:58 "Consistent, from what I remember. But it started to spin rapidly, like it had been frenzied...

2341 2018-12-14 19:26:07 No, but you don’t have to be Adam Smith to understand how supply chains and global markets work. If the price of Saudi oil goes up the price of all oil goes up.

2394 2018-12-14 19:22:26 Trudeau has nothing to do with the global drop of oil prices and the problem is that Alberta has a single resource economy, which never works well in the long run. If they’d focus more on green energy, they’d diversify the economy more and be more future proofed.
2395 2018-12-14 19:22:22 I don't think that is the right way to look at this. The U.S. doesn't care about African land or resources. Quite the opposite, they've cut their buying of Afr. oil a lot. Instead, this is about challenging China and Africa is largely irrelevant here, merely a bystander.
2396 2018-12-14 19:22:20 But if the demand for Bamboo products increases the need for more land to grow it will surely involve deforestation. Look how our increased demand for Palm Oil, cheap to produce, but at the cost of acres of forests being felled and the deaths of Orang-utans

2417 2018-12-14 19:20:06 Shredded brussels sprouts sautéed in coconut oil with black mustard seeds and green chilis and curry leaves is a game changer!
2418 2018-12-14 19:20:05 All the talk I hear coming from Alberta about how the rest of Canada should be using their oil instead of the Saudis. All of a sudden, the NEP that they derided in the early 80s looks pretty good in hindsight. #abpoli #cdnpoli

2424 2018-12-14 19:19:43 Eventually, yeah, as in many decades or even centuries. The United States alone has vast coal reserves, short- and mid-term scarcity is a non-issue.

You guys have been telling us we were running out of oil for decades, that argument is weak.

2461 2018-12-14 19:15:30 How is the oil payola looking?
2462 2018-12-14 19:15:30 Depends on the type of fats. Good fats like avocado, olive oil, peanut butter etc takes fat away from your heart and vessels to be metabolised, reducing your risk of heart issues etc

2465 2018-12-14 19:15:21 APC govt is doing more infrastructure projects when FG is earning 60% less. When oil was selling for over 100$ under PDP NOTHING was done to stop poverty instead the money was stolen do you want to put thieves back in office #nextlevel

2474 2018-12-14 19:14:02 There should be transparency in subsidy. We will diversify the economy from oil. Restructuring infrastructure, excesses should be allocated to education.

2488 2018-12-14 19:12:51 Deregulation of the oil sector is the only way that makes sense. Allow people build refineries and sell off govt’s equity on refineries let market forces determine prices.
2489 2018-12-14 19:12:50 Or maybe it goes to purchasing extra Saudi oil to fuel the PM’s jet so they can have drinking parties at 35000 feet?

2496 2018-12-14 19:12:21 The answer may depend more on where China gets their oil from than anything else. If the US becomes a major supplier of oil to China (not impossible) their position might confound Confucius:)

2553 2018-12-14 19:05:36 Came to get an oil change let’s see how long this takes 
2554 2018-12-14 19:05:14 Lol I hate getting my oil changed. They always charge me so much more for it! I always pay 90-100 and I DONT FUCKIN KNOW! The one time I go with my boyfriend and we get charged like 50. That pisses me off sm
2555 2018-12-14 19:05:05 "The PDP brought about the poverty APC govt is doing what took India and Brazil's poverty figures down". "APC govt doing this when FG is earning 60% less. When oil was selling for over 100$ under PDP NOTHING was done to stop poverty instead the money was stolen" -VP Osinbajo
2556 2018-12-14 19:05:05 Why do any nation continued to support this roach motel circus. No article 8 no  inational rate. Just invade this SHIT nation and take the oil for payment!!!!
2557 2018-12-14 19:05:04 Got tea tree oil on my eyelashes now it’s in my eyes shit look blurry af lol
2558 2018-12-14 19:04:53 The oil barons don't want people to know alternatives exist, because they don't want to lose their stranglehold (and coincidentally, billions in government subsidies) on the energy industry.  Research, find ways to get involved, and use your voice to call for a better way.

2560 2018-12-14 19:04:51 I’m allergic to poles but I can walk on water like Jesus , my big black ass is seldom ashy so I’m well acquainted with baby oil, I take checks, Bestbuy gift cards, EBT cards and cash app/Venmo , I’m not physically fit but I’m fit where you’re paying to see.
2561 2018-12-14 19:04:49 I wonder what the sign language translator did when the ACPN governor said we “soleleh depend on oil” #vicepresidentialdebate
2562 2018-12-14 19:04:40 @dominos_india hi, please tell me whether do you use oil or butter in your products. And whether the cheese you use is dairy cheese or something else?
2563 2018-12-14 19:04:36 Something I do to help speed the alcohol removal is put a CLEAN 12” fan right behind my cooker . The dry air helps remarkably to get your oil the correct consistency.
2564 2018-12-14 19:04:29 And they need to fund this endeavor with oil, so they wanted an explicit endorsement of their natural resources policy and a diminution of renewables in the west. Drill baby, drill; arctic exploitation in Alaska and Siberia; commercialization of arctic shipping, etc.
2565 2018-12-14 19:04:29 Ooh, the essential oil is a helpful tip I hadn't heard before. Thanks, I'll look into that. I have compression socks, but I also itch a lot and so I find these particular ones unbearable after a little while, especially now that it's summer.

2567 2018-12-14 19:04:03 It will be so because the PDP should have built a strong reserve which would have helped to buffer the sudden drop in prices of oil globally.  The failure of the PDP to save during the raining days is upon us now.  Thank God we have a vibrant leadership in PMB and PYO
2568 2018-12-14 19:03:59 Tell me how Beto voting to deregulate the banks, fast track the TPP, ending a 40 year law that limited oil exports is progressive? He’s a corporate dem good/ok on social issues & gop on economic issues.
2569 2018-12-14 19:03:47 i swear this is true... even if developers are always busy, they will always find a time out for you...unlike the oil industry i  am coming from.
2570 2018-12-14 19:03:46 Not really. Scottish oil subsidies you, you steal the revenue for itself. If Brexit isn't cancelled, time for Scotland to go it's own way
2571 2018-12-14 19:03:46 As for shares, the very largest majority of oil by geography, 90+% if I mind right.

2573 2018-12-14 19:03:45 I hate lice with a vengeance but I'd rather my kiddo have something that I would have to spend an hour or two combing out of their hair then an actual malady. No crazy pesticides on their scalp, just oil the hair and comb, comb, comb and comb again.
2574 2018-12-14 19:03:41 Are you selling products to get that oil slick out of your hair or do enjoy bathing in the wastewater of the Exxon Valdez every morning?
2575 2018-12-14 19:03:40 The acne problem never ends ei, you must just use products that will help minimise your break outs. Use products with Salicylic Acid, it helps mimise the secretion of oil. Also wash, tone and moisturize every morning and night
2576 2018-12-14 19:03:25 Back to realty, even though that economic engine could use a new fuel valve or oil change, it’s still operating and producing Treasure that is then being collected and needed as a reward to support the ruler instead of where it makes sense and is actually needed.
2577 2018-12-14 19:03:24 Can't we just have a trump-like candidate in Nigeria. Someone who will just say ' We will be importing everything into Nigeria, We will start selling oil blocs at the rate of N500k, We will allow Nigerians to procure visa to anywhere they want'. Someone Crazy!! #2019Debate

I do use garlic infused olive oil thougj

Too lazy to do garlic on weekdays and premade paste taste a but weird

If I go all out I bake some garlic and squish them out
2580 2018-12-14 19:03:05 Oil, wind, water, well-educated populace, technologically advanced industries. Shorn of the dead-hand of a SE England focussed Westminster and we'd be fine. We could have policies that suit us rather than The City...
2581 2018-12-14 19:02:49 That’s awesome, good choice. But as a country you purchased the oil from them and never paid. You should ask the government for your $1.25 back.
2582 2018-12-14 19:02:48 Cod. And interesting, because it's a 150-yr-old bottle touted for cod liver oil, and a  testament to how the size of cod has shrunk in the Atlantic because of humans and climate change.
2583 2018-12-14 19:02:48 And olive oil. 
2584 2018-12-14 19:02:45 Bruh all I wanted was my oil changed
2585 2018-12-14 19:02:45 Don't mind him. The private sector that wanted to build it wants to build it in appreciation if they are given the contract to be in charge of drilling oil in the state. I hv forgotten the name of the oil company. That our guy Ifeanyi use to work for that company
2586 2018-12-14 19:02:32 If it weren’t for Trump the left would have shut down US oil and coal. That is what they strive for, luckily there’s someone in charge that isn’t an activist but a realist.
2587 2018-12-14 19:02:30 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2588 2018-12-14 19:01:45 foods like chips & candy. Palm oil can be produced sustainably. As a consumer, you can choose products labeled “RSPO”; this label is bestowed by The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an organization formed to promote the growth and use of certified sustainable palm oil.

2590 2018-12-14 19:01:21 Vi kommer sluta bränna olja när vi passerat peak oil och det börjar kosta mer energi att pumpa upp oljan än den ger. Om detta sker om tio, tjugo eller femtio år spelar ingen större roll vad gäller växthuseffekten.
2591 2018-12-14 19:01:20 It was less than half the US per capita figure in 1980. Not bad, although that was coming off a major boom in global oil prices. And assuming you can trust the numbers, same issue as with China.
2592 2018-12-14 19:01:02 It's just an obvious point to me. Small, developed countries tend to do better. Add Scotland's wind, water and oil (although better to leave that in the ground if we can afford to), and surely the financial argument falls in its own sword...

2598 2018-12-14 19:00:17 I have circulation issues in my legs now that I'm nearly 60. I use a dry brush and compression socks at night, and eucalyptus essential oil during the day. (It's worse in winter as it burns.) Sometimes, yoga helps, too.
2599 2018-12-14 19:00:11 Ah they are avoiding some sanctions by transferring oil at sea, along with goods, they are continuing to build weapons and storage facilities, and you are blowing smoke up everyone's a--s by saying all is well and you can wait (for what?) This has failed along with your rhetoric
2600 2018-12-14 19:00:08 there's a yerba mate essential oil? I wonder if it actually smells like yerba
2601 2018-12-14 19:00:06 When oil was at $100 per barrel, there was no infrastructure, now, we are spending more on infrastructure with 60% less earnings- @ProfOsinbajo ... #VPDebate #2019Debate #NextLevel
2602 2018-12-14 19:00:05 Of course, especially when they are invading sanction by illegally shipping oil.

2606 2018-12-14 18:59:53 Doing more with less is a feat to beat. Despite earning less from revenue generated from oil, infrastructural deficit is being bridged on a steady.

2607 2018-12-14 18:59:46 Can someone teach me how to change my oil bc I’m tired of paying for it.
2608 2018-12-14 18:59:45 #2019Debate
@Ganiyu Galadima
Nigeria does not have the capacity to determine the oil price at the moment.
2609 2018-12-14 18:59:39 they should do your oil change for free. I bet if you flirted with them they would goddess.
2610 2018-12-14 18:59:34 I'm certainly guilty of that. Surely, though, there must be a balance between healthy skepticism and freaking out about "chemicals" and "toxins" and other forms of gullibility that pushes people into the arms of various snake oil salesmen.

2615 2018-12-14 18:59:16 Im sure they gave you advice but do be careful on dosage etc. Clove oil is extremely strong. I would have only put one drop on a cotton bud and press it to the enamel for instance.
2616 2018-12-14 18:59:11 Separate and sell the oil to the east with a nice profit margin. Produce our own dairy and wheat. We’d be fine. Them....not so much
2617 2018-12-14 18:58:55 Lots of new oil and gas pipelines, subsidizing coal and mining, increased law enforcement funding and Military.
2618 2018-12-14 18:58:39 Yes play the blame game.
Because dems has control of the house, q4 financials for most companies dropped
Because of dems the trade war started in oct.
Because of dems oil prices dropped
Because of dems the dollar rose and is hard to find buyers from other countries

2627 2018-12-14 18:57:23 Ya stay going for the dummies that sell oil pens and weed for a living.
2628 2018-12-14 18:57:12 I use fresh rosemary and pull the leaves off the stems, with minced garlic (or shallots sometimes), salt, pepper, olive oil, and paprika. I think that's exactly what you listed!
2629 2018-12-14 18:57:00 If we replace NatSec with Foreign Policy in the list, does it change Seth's overall point? Papadopoulos was a campaign advisor whose role was apparently working on "foreign policy" issues concerning oil and gas. Trump's team associated what he did with "National Security" issues.
2630 2018-12-14 18:56:53 Vegans promote the oil and petroleum industries!
2631 2018-12-14 18:56:52 Yes! He’s itsekiri and also a billionaire in the oil business!
2632 2018-12-14 18:56:51 Neither is the want for oil. It doesn’t gives a nation the right to invade another, yet we did it. How about less involvement in eastern hemisphere and work on our western?
2633 2018-12-14 18:56:38 Hey Carl, we only cook our fries in peanut oil. We don’t use any oil to cook out burgers.

I once had a race with my ex-boyfriend at the barriers.  He saw my face and knew I wanted to race him.  We both had 1.6 engines, so would have been even, except that upon pulling away, suddenly a bloody oil tanker was in front of me.  I wasn’t going to argue with him!

2661 2018-12-14 18:52:34 You can make garlic oil pretty easily by just putting a cup of olive /neutral oil + 3 heads of garlic into a pot and roasting in an oven at 350 for 90 minutes. The best part is you can throw in seared chicken breast and it'll cook with the oil.
2662 2018-12-14 18:52:32 Okay but what’s your favorite essential oil?
2663 2018-12-14 18:52:29 When you steep your tea for too long and now it tastes like motor oil going down 
2664 2018-12-14 18:52:28 Actually that was part 1 because of the oil pipeline and many of the water treatment plants of our nation are already outdated and businesses are pouring dangerous chemicals into our rivers and streams. Sioux falls SD for example is a cancer hotspot as a result
2665 2018-12-14 18:52:26 Chernobyl can be blamed on Communism more than nuclear power. Lock at Soviet oil, gas, hydro and Coal, how many died in that production?

2683 2018-12-14 18:49:40 I keep hearing that fusion is around the corner. For 40 years...
Looks like China will achieve that while we are bla bla-ing and defending Big Oil.
2684 2018-12-14 18:49:29 This country is getting dumber by the day...I can't imagine what Whistlers energy foot print must be ...But, I bet it's full of oil !!!!!
2685 2018-12-14 18:49:27 might have used a lil too much kush oil in me breakfast awhoops
2686 2018-12-14 18:49:04 I need a oil change so bad
2687 2018-12-14 18:49:02 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2688 2018-12-14 18:49:00 今トイレ行こうとしたら住んでるの私一人なのにトイレの鍵閉まってて失禁待った無しか？と思ったけどマイナスドライバーで開いた
2689 2018-12-14 18:48:58 Nobody is expecting an apology. Trump is a snake oil salesman & I can see how his populist rhetoric would appeal to a certain demographic. I even said to my wife on the Monday before the election that he might win, and he did.

It's about leaning from past mistakes at thud point.
2690 2018-12-14 18:48:57 i needed an oil change & air in my tires so bad i feel like a new person don’t speak to me
2691 2018-12-14 18:48:21 He’s smuggling oil off shore...yup he’s doing great!!!
2692 2018-12-14 18:48:14 Hi Greta you are absolutely right& thank you for shouting out loud what many politicians refuse to hear.
You have to know that those who don't do anything to change are not just irresponsible. They are corrupt.
Lobbies of oil are powerful & they don't care if we die they make $
2693 2018-12-14 18:48:05 The View is doing a segment about gifts you can buy for under 50 dollars and so far they’ve shown olive oil and honey and GOD DAMN PEOPLE, YOURE SPENDING 50 BUCKS ON HONEY?!
2694 2018-12-14 18:47:59 Like oil isn't subsidized via having American troops on every continent. These "dumb energy" morons need only visit their nearest veterans cemetery if they want to see the cost.
2695 2018-12-14 18:47:47 @peter didn't exactly answer his second question but he is fun to listen to. Truth is, I'm only interested in listening to @ProfOsinbajo & @realpeterobi but Uncle Yemi isn't dipping his yam in the intellectual oil.
2696 2018-12-14 18:47:28 The Lord Jesus’ Spirit within your bellies empowers the common man to rise up and overthrow his spiritual, political, and economic oppressors. Fresh oil be imparted to all your bellies from the Lord Jesus Christ today! 
2697 2018-12-14 18:47:23 If you see me just pouring oil in my car, pls mind your own damn business and just know I’ll get the actual oil change whenever I feel like it bitch

2700 2018-12-14 18:46:31 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2701 2018-12-14 18:46:30 Scandavian countries are getting better in so far as they adopt more free market ideals. And isn't Norway heavily dependent on oil? All socialist areas are a cost and a net negative not a positive.  Socialism destroys information.  Destruction of information is bad in an economy.
2702 2018-12-14 18:46:29 His inability to find people to join his administration? He’s a bad snake oil salesman and he’s running out of suckers.
2703 2018-12-14 18:46:13 Check your Transmission oil today.
2704 2018-12-14 18:46:13 What negotiations? We leave, keep our oil and they get to keep the WMD. Simples.
2705 2018-12-14 18:46:10 Talking of GDP sir, can you tell Nigerians how @OfficialPDPNig depleted the excess crude oil which av a negative effect on the economy & GDP
2706 2018-12-14 18:46:07 Sooo slow #cl_f #manipulation #oil
2707 2018-12-14 18:45:59 Remainers don’t you see you are being played ? Tony Blair ‘snake oil selling ‘ his desires for a globalist peddled People’s vote . I’d steer clear if I were you ...it’s not how they are portraying it all . Soros funded too remember !!!
2708 2018-12-14 18:45:53 Waiting for my oil change
2709 2018-12-14 18:45:39 "Oil market back to deficit..." Has anyone told this to the oil market, yet?

2713 2018-12-14 18:45:08 The product quality may be different, they also have access to oil treatments and deep conditioners which usually helps with keeping hair healthy
2714 2018-12-14 18:44:56 I doubt it very much. Its clear that you have no idea. How do you think UK companies manufacture for US aircraft manufacturers? Or Middle East oil companies? You obviously have no idea what you are talking about. You are Welcome.

2717 2018-12-14 18:44:32 Thays ridiculous! CBD oil is prefectly legal!!! People depend on it for their health! Smh big pharma rears its ugly head I bet.
2718 2018-12-14 18:44:25 Finally got tea tree oil. Seborrheic dermatitis, sis, you’re CANCELLED
2719 2018-12-14 18:44:21 @alissa_ashleyy hey sis I need that oil concoction you talkin about, pmooooooo
2720 2018-12-14 18:44:16 2 billion daily is wasteful. Nigeria have been producing oil in commercial quantity and yet we have no functional refinery. Do Qatar buy fuel from abroad?

2725 2018-12-14 18:43:53 Gov should try to give relief to common ppl by lowering GST on flour, Oil, Rice, Pulses rather than giving any other subsidy @Hammad_Azhar @Asad_Umar n increase on luxury
2726 2018-12-14 18:43:50 I still get oily through out the day in my Tzone but it’s not a little oil sheet can’t fix! I also set my face with Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless finish setting powder and sometimes I’ll use hourglass veil translucent powder if I’m doing a full glam.
2727 2018-12-14 18:43:43 so my evening primrose oil supplements just came in lol I bought it cause it helps with horomal imbalances do maybe it’ll do good to my skin

2730 2018-12-14 18:43:37 You’ve got the tub of oil and May waiting to be tongued by the French twat.

2733 2018-12-14 18:43:32 Seguramente le recetara un tratamiento psiquiátrico para que el petróleo fluya y la producción se incremente sin inversión, sin tecnología y sin personal con conocimiento y experticia en el área de Oil&Gas.
2734 2018-12-14 18:43:31 I'm with Jim on this one.  Fear is everywhere, yield curve is still not negative and oil is tanking; sounds more like the famous climbing the wall of worry to me, at this point.
2735 2018-12-14 18:43:29 She's a snake oil saleswoman.
2736 2018-12-14 18:43:20 Anyone  willing to donate tires size p205 55 16? And/or oil change?
2737 2018-12-14 18:43:13 We get our oil cheaper from Saudi, Africa and Venezuela. Market drives oil. Even @stephenharper said it. The cost of pipelines & refineries makes it unaffordable, let alone the environmental factors. Check the 2 massive spills w Keystone & the FEDERAL judge who killed the pipe!

2742 2018-12-14 18:42:52 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2743 2018-12-14 18:42:52 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2744 2018-12-14 18:42:48 Does anyone know a good face oil for super dry skin?
2745 2018-12-14 18:42:43 Hey their smuggling in oil out at sea. So much for sanctioning their oil. North Korea is never going to change. Their leader is a brutal mass murdering Dictator who got exactly what he wanted from you. Recognition for all the world to see. He played you.
2746 2018-12-14 18:42:43 fair point, but oil paint isn’t something that people out there really need. people in need could really use soap!!
2747 2018-12-14 18:42:31 Ab toh adat si hai mujh ko oil Kay sath jeenay may
2748 2018-12-14 18:42:21 You are ignoring the fact that we once were in a recession and Obama pulled us out with a GDP growth of 3.1% and lowered a high unemployment to 3.9%.
Democrats want to get away from coal and oil because it is bad to environment and it will make the US like Venezuela.
2749 2018-12-14 18:42:20 What happened to the Oil Rice business on here? I never got to try it.
2750 2018-12-14 18:42:10 Let’s throw half a trillion is subsidies at it for a decade and then see if it’s still as expensive as running a fossil fuel industry that’s jeopardizing the sustainability of our planet. Oil had its helping hand. Renewables’ turn. Fair is fair, no?

2754 2018-12-14 18:42:00 @btenergy We hasve a technology that uses solar energy to produce more oil from existing wells. The technology is able to produce base load electricity with energy storage. Some aspects of the technology is being used to do air conditioning. Another  to distill polluted watyer
2755 2018-12-14 18:41:43 In the past two weeks I’ve had 3 people from my classes ask me to “just take a look” at their car which implies oil change or changing light bulbs and a few other random things and honestly I’m so over touching cars that aren’t mine
2756 2018-12-14 18:41:35 Let’s see. A rational business man would think: they went out of business because there is no market for the ideas put forth by their employees, so I should hire them and it will do great thing for my company. No that doesn’t make sense. I’ll pass.
2757 2018-12-14 18:41:12 And they are breaking sanctions by smuggling in oil.
2758 2018-12-14 18:41:07 I was suppose to get off Wilcox and Garfield to get an oil change, then the ramp was closed and somehow managed to end up by cal state LA 
2759 2018-12-14 18:41:05 Does all the oil / fluids from the vehicles that go over I-90 and 520 bridges go right into Lake Washington?
2760 2018-12-14 18:41:05 I usually hate gifts because clutter, but one favorite was some really nice olive oil.
2761 2018-12-14 18:41:00 I get paid tonight and I’m gonna order some 4’x8’ sheets of cardboard to do some big oil paintings on and I’m EXCITED
2762 2018-12-14 18:40:55 @realDonaldTrump if we put sanctions on Saudi Arabia whos to say hes not to go over and talk to Putin and start pumping Russia full of oil for their fuel needs who's to say Russia is not behind the murder to put a wedge between Saudi Arabia an America to break ties
Think about it
2763 2018-12-14 18:40:51 Americans destroy countries in every corner of the world supporting corrupted governments only because of oil & money and then don't want to have any consequences. You know what? Keep quiet and nothing will happen. Bunch of hypocrites.
2764 2018-12-14 18:40:32 Did you try the fish oil capsules?
2765 2018-12-14 18:40:28 Love sandalwood soap and have worn patchouli oil since the 80’s! (Have it on now)
2766 2018-12-14 18:40:23 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
2767 2018-12-14 18:40:15 Y’all I returned my textbook, got my oil changed, filled my tank, and went to the gym and it’s only 10:40, today is going to be a good day
2768 2018-12-14 18:40:10 HappyHannakuh!!!The Temple had 2 be cleansed for 8 days bcz of pagan rituals....enough oil n lamp 4 only 1 day...God'sburned the other 7 days! Your will b done n our land O God!!!

2770 2018-12-14 18:40:05 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
2771 2018-12-14 18:40:04 I heard the same about a ruffian who stole too much cod liver oil
2772 2018-12-14 18:39:58 Only a matter of time before the charade of compliance is dropped and oil transfers become blatant. Trump is weak in their mind and his domestic troubles reinforce that view.
2773 2018-12-14 18:39:46 I love this idea of Albertan separatism. Like, our main economic hurdle right now is getting oil through other provinces to tidewater, and separating would help that... how? 

Psst, here's a secret: it would make things even worse.
2774 2018-12-14 18:39:41 My fav kinds of oil paint? White and yellow
2775 2018-12-14 18:39:32 Thank you my friend
What sort of paint do you use? It looks like either oil or acrylic paints

2776 2018-12-14 18:39:08 The fact you don’t have to get out for an oil change....love this place
2777 2018-12-14 18:38:54 Lol just getting my routine oil and filter change nothing crazy. Well I’m not doing it this time, I have a coupon for it that made it cheap so I’m having the dealership do it
2778 2018-12-14 18:38:48 oil changes take fucking forever
2779 2018-12-14 18:38:46 It can't. What happens is unsold products & crude pile up in tanks/tankers because while Fed can print $ to support price it can't print logistics. Sooner or later $ oil price falls & after a lag USD currency falls
2780 2018-12-14 18:38:43 Chia better hope that the Oil make the playoffs or this won’t play well at all.
2781 2018-12-14 18:38:43 This mf prius dead ass cut me in line for my oil change 
2782 2018-12-14 18:38:40 Casava leaf (coconut oil) to be specific taste great, but petete leaf stays @ num 1 for me
2783 2018-12-14 18:38:34 Alberta is landlocked, look at a map. That'll get oil to the markets when you have to deal with a foreign country to get it there.  Grow up.
2784 2018-12-14 18:38:23 The #NationalOilScandal CONTINUES to unravel. More people now giving us more information. Keep sending info through 4kiplangat@gmail.com. Tomorrow we unravel names of those siphoning National Oil with using a company that is not even registered. This country nkt!
2785 2018-12-14 18:38:11 HAHAHA Yeah, he sees that you are a first rate fool. He's getting all the oil and coal and whatever else he needs by sneaking out with his ships while you aren't paying attention. Sanctions? Ignored. Still building nukes. Still building missiles. Nothing at all has changed. FOOL!
2786 2018-12-14 18:38:07 When the brominated vegetable oil reaches your body on the cellular level. So like 20 minutes.
2787 2018-12-14 18:38:02 Time could be better spent  exposing actual facts about anything.. immigration, taxes , 
Big oil , healthcare costs etc etc etc.
2788 2018-12-14 18:37:59 The growth of economics and the industry of the nation can't come for free. Millions of people suffered and struggled to survive, yet the outcome was a large advancement of America. There was pain and suffering, however, it was for the betterment of our society.
2789 2018-12-14 18:37:57 Es con carajo nomas, sssseco fuel oil
2790 2018-12-14 18:37:48 Yess ! I agree with the PTSD, that's what I have and CBD oil helps me a lot 
2791 2018-12-14 18:37:42 Is it a mass debate? If they're coming it could be an oil slick.

2796 2018-12-14 18:37:12 @RisingProfits30 @IvanNikolic i can sell now at 2.43+ but let see how oil do in the weekend .GL
2797 2018-12-14 18:37:11 Same reason they send you random samples of cologne, thinking you will just put some strange oil that came from nowhere on your skin. Deeply stupid marketing people.
2798 2018-12-14 18:37:08 It’s leaking oil  which I’m not even mad at the car anymore, I’m mad at the person that “fixed” it. I took it somewhere else and was told whoever changed my oil NEVER changed the filter 
2799 2018-12-14 18:36:59 A brave man, spoke the mind of many.
2800 2018-12-14 18:36:55 oil drippin from the wals
2801 2018-12-14 18:36:47 There was something wrong with the Baby oil aswell. Remember that from a Oprah Winfrey show many years ago.
2802 2018-12-14 18:36:41 I'm 45 minutes late for the comedy and soul show in Menlyn Time Square, my friend has been waiting for me for an hour and I have the tickets. I need oil from your pastor's.
2803 2018-12-14 18:36:36 A restoring facial mask, sultry cobalt blue, with beetle mica, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating Dead Sea minerals. The sachet it comes in is attractive.
2804 2018-12-14 18:36:12 I can’t seem to find any product that doesn’t make my face the shiniest of oil by 1pm
2805 2018-12-14 18:36:00 I'm getting an oil change rn and I am so nervous they're gonna find other shit wrong lmao
2806 2018-12-14 18:35:49 Israeli pan.  Ingredients: flour, flour, tomato paste, carrot, cornstarch, and olive oil.
2807 2018-12-14 18:35:42 If they like to cook, an interesting olive oil and/or balsamic vinegar is nice.
2808 2018-12-14 18:35:38 @gikibadges the badge system is skewed. Palm oil free is made to look worse than sustainable palm oil. And should really mark down plastic water bottles
2809 2018-12-14 18:35:33 To get an oil change now or wait ?
2810 2018-12-14 18:35:30 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @MCaruso_Cabrera There is no measurable gain from lower gasoline prices at this point, net net profits lost by US #oil producers will impact #DOW #SP500 more.Whilst #OPEC exist to maintain/increase #brent prices, #Trump oddly hurts US oil #wti industry
2811 2018-12-14 18:35:27 Tea tree oil, I love you
2812 2018-12-14 18:35:25 Reeeeaaaaallllyyyy. Well call me from the burn ward after you deep fry something in butter.  I’ll be eating coconut oil fried popcorn chicken. 
2813 2018-12-14 18:35:13 DOW dumps a buck oil drops too.
2814 2018-12-14 18:35:03 @DukeCambridgeUK @Prince___Harry @Charles_HRH Year 2019 maybe make INR 1=1 USD and further with Electric Vehicle in India, India Import $44.1B out of that 52.6% Oil, were as Export $26.98B.

there will be huge surplus in trade balance if Indians start use electric vehicle
2815 2018-12-14 18:34:36 I also appreciate the psychological wizardry of “little bit of mayo” and “little bit of oil” that lets me eat sandwiches with average amounts of oil and mayo but I feel better about myself
2816 2018-12-14 18:34:18 *it was the only way to do it 

Lol, no, you didn’t literally hand those companies anything. That industry is nothing but hard work. The wildcatters and oil men of the past century plus would laugh in your face for that one.
2817 2018-12-14 18:34:16 Alaska should secede and become an ordoliberal/Nordic Model utopia fueled by oil and salmon
2818 2018-12-14 18:34:14 Olive oil, rosemary, thyme and salt and pepper
2819 2018-12-14 18:34:05 leave it to brad to use la donna e mobile in the olive oil episode!!! just say you hate women and go
2820 2018-12-14 18:34:04 I suppose it's still the denial phase.  I'm not sure why anyone would remain bullish here.  Oil is gone, Banks, gone.  Transports on life support.  Retail, crap.  Restaurants give numbers that are trending down.

Now, if the US economy is based 65% + on consumption?  Bearish.

2822 2018-12-14 18:33:54 All the pain and suffering that the lowest class went through, many generations lives were ruined just so that we could advance a tiny bit, that is not worth it. We could advance just as much without the suffering if @mr_oil_man @Themelonman4 and @AndrewC09462884 could be fair.
2823 2018-12-14 18:33:39 Failure of the AOS (air and oil separator) cannot be ignored and it needs to be replaced as soon as possible. Ignoring or neglecting this problem can result in hydrolock and, subsequently, permanent damage to the engine.
2824 2018-12-14 18:33:37 And for you, on behalf of all your tweeps:this jumbo (albeit imaginary) jar of leather oil...applied to Mjolnir's strap daily, it will cut down on all that painful twirl-chafing!
Keep praising the Allfather and smacking down His enemies!
2825 2018-12-14 18:33:30 No it's oil. The world runs on oil.
2826 2018-12-14 18:33:30 Why do we IMPORT OIL if we are a "Net Oil Exporter"??  Doesn't make sense....  Or is it that I'm tired?  Someone please explain...thanks.
2827 2018-12-14 18:33:22 Was not at all those guns, you sure kill lots of garlic and olive oil, and now my hands smell awesome.
2828 2018-12-14 18:33:19 I remembered the day Mum gave me anointing oil to drink so it can “soften my heart” just because I watch horror movies and I don’t cringe.
African mothers and being extra
2829 2018-12-14 18:33:09 Imagine there’s a reason why they are 300 bob? I once hung out with someone who ran a premium restaurant, and often the oil they use for their fries are different, like this guy used canola oil instead of normal vegetable oil.
2830 2018-12-14 18:33:06 @Themelonman4 @AndrewC09462884 @mr_oil_man The gilded age was kinda worth it, but not for what it did to the people. If we did not exploit the people, and made everything fair, then it would be good. Maybe if the gilded age was actually true to america, not the businessmen behind
2831 2018-12-14 18:33:05 Brad bought me new tires and got my oil changed  love this man!!
2832 2018-12-14 18:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
2833 2018-12-14 18:32:25 That’s rich. All Kenney cares about is power, which is why he crawled his butt back to Alberta after him and Harper got kicked to the curb. He has no platform aside from “GSA bad, Oil good” and the desire to sell our province to his buddies. He has nothing but himself in mind.
2834 2018-12-14 18:32:24 Guy!You de work?Abi na business?If you de work be sincere is your take home still taking you home?How much did you save for the year?If business, what is ur turn around for the year?

2836 2018-12-14 18:31:58 jess also gave me this garlic cooking oil and i love it it's making my life so good
2837 2018-12-14 18:31:53 I really did ask for an oil change for my car for christmas 
2838 2018-12-14 18:31:43 Yes. Get the oil going and the gas going.
2839 2018-12-14 18:31:41 i tweet for everyone digging the top off the lavender oil bottle with their fingernails because god knows that little dropper ain't gonna give u enough
2840 2018-12-14 18:31:40 Kenyan oil has not been commercialized yet, furthermore domestic usage has not began
2841 2018-12-14 18:31:24 Do not ever use Take 5 oil change. They're complete scammers.
2842 2018-12-14 18:31:19 No but it’s diffferent oil I think
2843 2018-12-14 18:31:19 Better get your Time Machine in for an oil change, since you're re-lying on it so heavily. #trumpRussia #mookLawyer
2844 2018-12-14 18:31:07 i’m telling her to get on this black seed oil, she talking about it won’t agree with her medication. girl! that’s the damn problem here!
2845 2018-12-14 18:30:49 I dunno, what do renewables get now? 

But it literally IS, right now, cheap/sustainable and exploration and production get more efficient every year. 

Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. South Dakota outproduces it.
2846 2018-12-14 18:30:45 Looking for a tasty food that has anti-microbial properties? Try extra virgin coconut oil which contains lauric acid. The body converts the lauric acid into monolaurin, a monoglyceride our bodies use to smack down certain types of viruses and pathogenic bacteria
2847 2018-12-14 18:30:41 GIRL I have my essential oils diffuser that came w tea tree oil!!! i’m gonna use it tn
2848 2018-12-14 18:30:30 Or let me know when you're in town, and I can bring to you...along with some complimentary beard oil. But I'm sure that's not an option.
2849 2018-12-14 18:30:26 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
2850 2018-12-14 18:30:16 Millions of people are forced to live in poor living conditions because it's the only choice they have. Maybe if there was another, better option for housing, they would take it.
2851 2018-12-14 18:30:16 Personally I'm incredibly allergic to tea tree oil and eucalyptus and I've had people doubt me because "it's natural" BICTH WAT
2852 2018-12-14 18:30:14 Okay cool. So what I’ve been realizing is that getting something for their mentality or even their health is meaningful! Like essential oils or even a body oil for massages. Maybe get him an appointment for a self-care day? Something small but super thoughtful.
2853 2018-12-14 18:30:11 patchouli oil
2854 2018-12-14 18:30:10 now, what about the babies in baby oil ??
2855 2018-12-14 18:30:07 If rail is lone option to send Bakk oil to E Coast, carriers have power over shippers right? So if speed limits, then railways pass added  costs to oil producers when setting contracts? And producers would try  passing added costs to processers but latter would try alt. sources?
2856 2018-12-14 18:30:02 I understand your situation 
2857 2018-12-14 18:29:53 If they ask her if she used it then she should say "Man, I cannot thank you guys enough! We used it as a substitute for our regular gun oil on my AR-15 (my hubby has a M1A Springfield) and that shit is the FUCKIN' BOMB!!!! What is the name of the pro-shop that carries this?"
2858 2018-12-14 18:29:46 Yes!! With Lavender oil @younglivingeo I love them 
2859 2018-12-14 18:29:37 เหี้ยมาก55555
2860 2018-12-14 18:29:36 you may be right.

oh well, garbage goes my baby oil...
2861 2018-12-14 18:29:28 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil for everything (and essential oils are nice too!!!)
2862 2018-12-14 18:29:27 
2863 2018-12-14 18:29:26 Well they’re certainly addicted to our oil money.
2864 2018-12-14 18:29:25 Hmmm this reminds me of the old  theories in which George W  was a dummy who was also the mastermind behind the false flag operation to make oil companies rich
2865 2018-12-14 18:29:25 truffles yes, oil no, virgin or not
2866 2018-12-14 18:29:23 Media(2001-2008): 
Bush is a WAR CRIMINAL! He started a WAR for OIL !!!!
Arrest him!!!

Media(2018): Awww, look. He gave Michelle Obama some candy.

2867 2018-12-14 18:29:12 Got the black seed oil it’s a good day
2868 2018-12-14 18:29:10 I forgot my headphones at home and I have to wait an hour for this oil change 
2869 2018-12-14 18:29:06 hmm billions of dollars is less than 100.000 workers, I see how educated you are
2870 2018-12-14 18:29:05 Just took one squirt of CBD oil, think I might die
2871 2018-12-14 18:29:03 Then why do they have a bad life?
2872 2018-12-14 18:28:48 Anne is right, it IS dirty oil.  The attempted inter-provincial bullying, the disrespect and diregard for indigenous land and the voices of the people who's backyard the piplelines would run through. This oil is filthy and no one wants any part of it.
2873 2018-12-14 18:28:33 seriously 2 am got me watching random videos like how elephants are born to why olive oil is so expensive, bruh i need to chill
2874 2018-12-14 18:28:26 because we have more people than money
2875 2018-12-14 18:28:16 Stuck for a Christmas present?
Bottle of essential oil (or 2)
Orange oil is great for perking you up
Lavender for calming
You can add water and spray or add to oil burner
Cost roughly £5
Lasts for ages.
No chemicals
2876 2018-12-14 18:28:12 Giving millions of dollars and a chance at a better life to millions of people isn't criminal. It isn't my fault they don't have a better life when I did my part.

2878 2018-12-14 18:28:03 I haven't been using it long enough to make expert claims, but in the experience I've had - I can totally tell a difference. @MindofSnaps has been using it regularly for a long time & knows her shit, so she'd be the one to ask. But as far as my personal rec: not snake oil, do it.
2879 2018-12-14 18:28:02 Successful for you, Of course you are rich, you gain more profits than anybody else because you don't pay anybody! You would be successful. Also, can I mention that I did that to you. Payback's great isn't it!
2880 2018-12-14 18:27:49 It shall come to pass in that day That his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.

2881 2018-12-14 18:27:47 Geographic illiteracy aside, Fox *news* peddles snake oil for its dinner. But you know that.
2882 2018-12-14 18:27:45 .. why do you think they need oil from the beginning?
2883 2018-12-14 18:27:45 Sadly, what's missing from both analogies is the fact these people have been given the means to commit such vile acts by western led governments who's primary directive is to destabilise ME nations both for their oil and control of land, ie. Israel-Golan Heights-Syria-ISIS.
2884 2018-12-14 18:27:34 So that’s why he is breaking #Sanctions right? Getting #Oil in the dark of night at sea. 

Lies Lies Lies
2885 2018-12-14 18:27:20 seems reliable. Visual Capatalist. Thats your info?
2886 2018-12-14 18:27:17 Moon conj. Mars, 9:19 PM EDT & sextile Pluto, 12:05 AM:  Burning the midnight oil, if you're so inclined, is productive, less lackadaisical than earlier today as we zero in on our objectives. Acts of kindness to others take our mind off our own emotional tangles. #astrology
2887 2018-12-14 18:27:12 If you see posts from @Energy4USorg,

Don't beleive what it says. The NYT says it's paid by Marathon Patrolium & big oil to undercut car fuel economy rules that will reduce pollution and our dependence on oil.

GET THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SIGN PETITIONS

2888 2018-12-14 18:27:07 The 40 leaking mad oil. At first it was a little bit. Now it’s a fucking puddle.

2889 2018-12-14 18:27:00 หื้อออออ???
2890 2018-12-14 18:26:59 I look forward to them all going back to school to become computer programmers.   Or moving to North Dakota to enter the oil and gas industry.  Isn't that the RINO approach to losing your job?
2891 2018-12-14 18:26:57 See as OBO dey jump like rat wey enter hot oil .......heheheh
2892 2018-12-14 18:26:54 I changed my oil today and someone explain to me how I got it on my fucking windshield ?!
2893 2018-12-14 18:26:46 If millions of people are getting millions of dollars, then why are we living in places that stink and are dirty instead of mansions 
2894 2018-12-14 18:26:36 If we don't have any oil for internal gas supply, how can we cover any collateral for the #Petro?
Venezuela is the country with worst performance in OPEC.
Everything about #Petro is a lie, Venezuela is not able to pay in case you claim the collateral.
The country is in default.
2895 2018-12-14 18:26:35 Trump & his corporate backers, like the oil co's,  Koch Bros.

2896 2018-12-14 18:26:28 The Oil will be gone in 30+ years.
2897 2018-12-14 18:26:21 ahh yes the Weed Oil
but nah itll go away eventually i just gotta stop bein a gremlin lmao and last night i was more anxiety suffering than actual pain suffering
2898 2018-12-14 18:26:19 Hyped #tech #coding categories dying a slow but certain death : #java, #refactoring #oop #aop #hibernate #xml #patterns - with hype came complexity, and snake oil books followed soon after.
2899 2018-12-14 18:26:14 @mr_oil_man Look. Just treat your workers right. Give them money. You dont need to be the criminal. You just choose to be.
2900 2018-12-14 18:26:03 Yes but we got to put an embargo on Saudi Oil. 
Iran oil is cheaper and more reliable.
2901 2018-12-14 18:25:53 The 85% nationalist majority who live in and around the sperrins say there wont be any gold mines opening up in their back yards...you may dig for oil in Garvagh...good luck with that...
2902 2018-12-14 18:25:26 we have 7 oil diffusers in my house ahdhasghaah

2905 2018-12-14 18:25:19 I decided to be a DUMBASS and pull the stopper out of a bottle of fragrance oil WITH MY TEETH NOW ALL I TASTE IS LEATHER
2906 2018-12-14 18:25:18 Big dawg noticed I had a head light out so he told me to pop the hood.... I couldn’t find the thing to do that & he goes “I can see you check your oil like I tell you”  covers blown
2907 2018-12-14 18:25:09 Hahaha
2908 2018-12-14 18:25:07 
2909 2018-12-14 18:25:04 The number of rigs operating in the United States drilling for oil declined by 4 this week to 873, according to Baker Hughes, with 14 rigs taken out of service in December. There were 126 oil rigs deployed in the United States year-to-date, with ten added in the fourth quarter.
2910 2018-12-14 18:25:01 Is that hot oil?
2911 2018-12-14 18:24:59 got oil burns all over my chest the other night while cooking steak shirtless and now there is a real risk of me suddenly bleeding through my shirt at work today
2912 2018-12-14 18:24:52 Olive oil, vinegar, garlic, a bit of brown mustard, and spices!
2913 2018-12-14 18:24:52 Oil on stretched canvas lmao 
2914 2018-12-14 18:24:49 IF they build a wall Mexico will definitely “pay for it” over time due to less money that workers in the US will send to families in Mexico. That flow of revenue is more than what Mexico makes from exporting oil now.
2915 2018-12-14 18:24:49 You "respect the flag for what it stands for" is a very empty statement. You can literally attribute anything to that. So it stands for genocide, colonialism, imperialism, wars of aggression for oil? see, I can play this game too. It's not all about "liberty and freedom" chud.
2916 2018-12-14 18:24:32 @mr_oil_man hey its the 1906 version of fox news
2917 2018-12-14 18:24:32 @SOUNDCITYPHc USA produced the most oil in 2018
2918 2018-12-14 18:24:21 What are you talking about? OMG it's about accreditation... How on earth do you think we sell oil equipment is the US and the rest of the world? Accreditation is a compliance issue, it has nothing to do with 'influence and control'. You are Welcome. 
2919 2018-12-14 18:24:18 Where can I get the bio oil?
2920 2018-12-14 18:24:16 typically in argument you fight with evidence not claims
2921 2018-12-14 18:24:13 I don't have infinite money. Millions of workers are getting millions of dollars, which seems fair to me.

2923 2018-12-14 18:24:01 I don't see the big deal, TWS staff can just move to North Dakota and learn the oil and gas business.  Or go back to school to become computer programmers.  Isn't that the RINO approach to people losing their jobs?
2924 2018-12-14 18:23:58 I feel like Vampir Nosferatu is 3, and Batman's something like 6 after Nutt and a sentient oil derrick

2956 2018-12-14 18:20:48 Philip Anschutz is a Kansas grad who has mostly made his fortune from oil and transportation. I doubt if he losing a wink of sleep over the closing of the "Standard." P.S. The twitter word spelling substitution for Anschutz is "Chutzpah."
2957 2018-12-14 18:20:47 Must send Alberta oil  South, through the state of Washington. They want it. No so called first nation to deal with. Kinder Morgan is ready to build it. Seattle is ready.
2958 2018-12-14 18:20:38 S/O to the people who walked me through changing my oil cuz lord 
2959 2018-12-14 18:20:37 Is the wild growth oil in the white or yellow better? I like both.
2960 2018-12-14 18:20:29 I bought American Airlines when it went bankrupt at $.36/sh.

Paid for my new kitchen.
2961 2018-12-14 18:20:24 How much money? Not a lot since people are still living in the slums and working everyday with barely a break
2962 2018-12-14 18:20:19 News out today was military reporting NK is violating sanctions regarding oil. Add this to previous reports that NK is expanding nuclear facilities. That does not sound like "we're doing fine" but seeing how you folded in front of Pelosi, not surprised you FAILED in NK.
2963 2018-12-14 18:20:17 One of the reasons I'm not keen oil tree planting - it sort of bypasses one of the most exciting, and biodiverse, successional stages
2964 2018-12-14 18:20:14 Coal is worse for the environment than oil but not because of climate change.
2965 2018-12-14 18:20:11 Maybe they would if you properly paid them!

2967 2018-12-14 18:20:06 So, you’re saying Canada should create it’s own fuel company and refine our own oil products? Maybe call it Oil Can, Petroleum Canada, something like that lol.
2968 2018-12-14 18:19:56 *give
2969 2018-12-14 18:19:50 Standard MO of a snake oil salesman. Only this one is so , that he doesn't care that ppl know he's a pathological liar, and couldn't tell the truth to save his rear end.
2970 2018-12-14 18:19:43 you make millions and I've each worker cents!
2971 2018-12-14 18:19:40 dont you mean you give peanuts to them?

2973 2018-12-14 18:19:35 No you have to wait at least a minute or 2 for the car to warm up and have the oil flowing lol especially in the winter
2974 2018-12-14 18:19:34 If they were smart with their money they could invest in MY BANK and they could gain money from their investments.
2975 2018-12-14 18:19:33 @FiveGuysUK do you cook your burgers in peanut oil?
2976 2018-12-14 18:19:33 @mikeythefisch I’m gonna go get an oil change but I’ll be back in a bit to play if you wanna
2977 2018-12-14 18:19:17 I finally got an oil change my life is back on track 
2978 2018-12-14 18:19:17 I'm gonna clean the shit outta my car today and get an oil change. My poor car is a hot mess on the inside.
2979 2018-12-14 18:19:14 I make money and give it to people, it's not quite the same.
2980 2018-12-14 18:19:06 I go to this super Christian place to get my oil changed and I routinely get on grindr when I'm there. 

It's a riot.
2981 2018-12-14 18:19:06 Uhhh, lets see, did you miss rodney king, Trayvon martin, the oil and gas pipeline in the dakotas? Get woke!
2982 2018-12-14 18:19:03 If oil ever drops to $30 and stays there for 1 year, it will completely devastate Russia. I don't mean the economic disaster like in Venezuela, it's unlikely. Instead, all institutions will fall apart, no working law and order, no courts, no taxes, no healthcare nor education.

2985 2018-12-14 18:18:47 #CrudeOil FEB 2019 is 0.20 higher than JAN 2019 now. It means generally if you got rollover sellers will get 0.20 plus buyers 0.20 less arround. According your broker it will change.  When Current price higher then next month it is bull with evidence #oott Not yet happened. #oil
2986 2018-12-14 18:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2987 2018-12-14 18:18:40 You mean from the climate change deniers and oil & gas industry shills?
2988 2018-12-14 18:18:37 aren't you concerned that foreign controlled oil companies are dictating policy in Alberta? 

and you are aware that it was a court of law, enforcing the rule of law, that got TMX cancelled right? (am I the first to inform you of this? it was all over the news...)
2989 2018-12-14 18:18:34 Who decides the living conditions. You're the richest man alive, you could spare some money to help make the living conditions better!
2990 2018-12-14 18:18:20 how do they get the living conditions, WITH THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU PAY THEM
2991 2018-12-14 18:18:16 #Petro has no collateral.
How many times do I have to tell you if you want to claim your collateral for your #Petros then you must bring all your tools and take the oil out by Yourself?
Venezuelan oil production is down.
Only 1.100 Mill per day for China &Rusia debt.
2992 2018-12-14 18:18:14 Sure, it means you think “good people on both sides” applies to Nazi’s. So Trump must hate his own family and suddenly flipped after the election. It is all online.....but the truthers in WAPO are very feral. Radical stuff. “Big oil bad, Obama cool.”
2993 2018-12-14 18:18:07 I second this man!! My hair and hands have been so dry I literally rub coconut oil on them almost everytime I use it dstruggle
2994 2018-12-14 18:18:06 and the living conditions are caused by ___________
2995 2018-12-14 18:18:00 I will never forget the sensation of entering Waitrose that evening, choosing the olive oil and the courgettes, already imaging the Le Creuset I would cook them in
2996 2018-12-14 18:17:58 I see @chriscorrigan, things are in flux rapidly.  You wonder who is behind this? Oil and gas Public Relations firms? After all, creating public confusion and prolonging their business model is what they are all about.
2997 2018-12-14 18:17:38 gas and oil prices drops for 3 months boy i said
2998 2018-12-14 18:17:31 I believe that it's the living conditions that are impacting them, not the money they're receiving.
2999 2018-12-14 18:17:29 Glanon International, Inc. is the USA leader in portable filtration systems for oil & coolant.
The Filter-Cart has been reclaiming oil for applications such as: Injection molders; Turbines; Gear boxes; Compressors; Stamping machines. Merry Christmas to our friends in Plastics.
3000 2018-12-14 18:17:26 YOU JUST GO AND LITERALLY TREAT THESE PEOPLES LIKE PIGS AND MAKE MONEY OFF OF THEM! Maybe you should take facts in to consideration, hag.
3001 2018-12-14 18:17:14 i was like "i'll have some stroganoff before i go to the gym" but that was a bad idea because now i feel like an oil tanker minutes away from meeting a grisly fate
3002 2018-12-14 18:16:53 I live in PA.  Mr oil and gas money sucks.
3003 2018-12-14 18:16:47 You steal money, I steal photos, to HELP
3004 2018-12-14 18:16:42 Of course!! Always!! You even have to ask?? *quickly sniffs oil bottle and waits*
3005 2018-12-14 18:16:28 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
3006 2018-12-14 18:16:23 shiny dust

3008 2018-12-14 18:16:12 any oil painters on the tl wanna sell to me why oils are better@than acrylic/gouache/watercolor
3009 2018-12-14 18:16:10 HOW AM I A ROBBER???????
3010 2018-12-14 18:16:07 Nah not on their politics, but their oil resources. Let me make my stance simple for you "if we are ok answering one Nigeria by raping the oil rich regions, we should be ok as one Nigeria in discussing any region politics". 
Have a good day man.
3011 2018-12-14 18:15:52 maybe someone else would step up who is actually nicer than you
3012 2018-12-14 18:15:52 in dust
3013 2018-12-14 18:15:52 Use natural serum-in-oil.
3014 2018-12-14 18:15:42 I can’t stop feeling real anger:  why has #COP24 barely been mentioned on @CBCnews, our supposedly arms length, independent public broadcaster?  Why is there so much emphasis on the federal oil fight, but virtually nothing about investment in #greentech; why so little leadership?
3015 2018-12-14 18:15:40 Actually I am still alive right now, get your facts straight. I helped a lot  people, you have done nothing, I am a Captain, u are a robber !!!!!!

3018 2018-12-14 18:15:15 I think a massive investment in nuclear energy could serve as a way to bridge the gap between oil/coal and solar. It is fairly ”easy” to build nuclear plants and they are a proven and safe technology. Preferably if built on huge platforms at sea.
3019 2018-12-14 18:15:12 Rapier: No, The US Is Not A Net Exporter Of Crude Oil
 
 we aren’t net exporters of crude oil, and we aren’t energy independent. But, the U.S. has trended in that direction for over a decade. Regardless of whether it remains that way, this is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement.
3020 2018-12-14 18:15:02 Baby oil is not affected, right?
3021 2018-12-14 18:14:52 yeah. 2 cents a hecking hour. WOW MY PAYCHECK CAME IN! WOAH! 12 WHOLE CENTS! WOW!
3022 2018-12-14 18:14:47 I recall years ago making packet/box cake & only had to add oil + water.

3024 2018-12-14 18:14:36 The Shell Oil Company originally began as a novelty shop in London that sold seashells.
3025 2018-12-14 18:14:36 And you rely on them.
3026 2018-12-14 18:14:30 Check Pinterest for directions on how to mix- some call for the oil to be microwaved, but I loosened the coconut oil myself just by smashing it.
3027 2018-12-14 18:14:26 Oh yeah!
3028 2018-12-14 18:14:16 sludge from the oil industry?

3032 2018-12-14 18:14:11 Im from Ontario, but moved to Fort McMurray in 2007 and now live in Saskatoon since 2012 . I bought a house here and plan to stay here cause I love it here and so does my wife and two kids. I didn’t know anything about the farming and the oil industry until I moved out west .
3033 2018-12-14 18:14:03 @mr_oil_man @Themelonman4 Listen. If you guys actually were helping, then people wouldn't:
Die of cholera
have new York being the richest city in america but having 98% of the people who are poor
and maybe live longer that 30 years of age.
3034 2018-12-14 18:13:54 But Iran has a lot of resources that the Anglo-Saxons and the Zionist States want, oil, uranium, gold, and rare earths. Just need the pretext to invade them.
3035 2018-12-14 18:13:37 Nor would you be! You rely on them for your survival!

3044 2018-12-14 18:13:03 Oil prices up? Tax on consumers! Bad. Oil prices down? Slowing global growth! Bad.  Markets can’t recover as long as ALL economic data is spun negatively. #itsnotthatbad #norecession
3045 2018-12-14 18:13:00 im always afraid of trying rose hip oil,, were basically have the same type of skin, does it rlly work ??

I used doterra essential oils. 
Orange & peppermint. 
The tan jar is a brown sugar & orange oil w/ground oatmeal. 
The lighter colors I used white sugar.
3053 2018-12-14 18:12:39 i did not close what i bought from 52.2x. Waiting still.. Without SL #oott #crudeoil #usoil #oil
3054 2018-12-14 18:12:38 An indebted & rapidly sinking #Venezuela with its oil fields & territory leased out, is fertile ground for  establishment of bases by Russia & China. Landing of Russian bombers  either a temporary military threat or indications of future military base.
3055 2018-12-14 18:12:28 Just realized Christmas is in 11 days and I still have three (3) oil paintings i have to finish as gifts and i just realized they’re never going to dry in time :-)
3056 2018-12-14 18:12:25 Norway is taking the money from oil funds and giving them to the public to buy ev's.
3057 2018-12-14 18:12:23 Happy Bornday brother @Lega_c.
You smell like motor oil left under a car port out Bowie for a yr boy. You’re one of my personal unsung heroes from here. An honor sharing a stage w/ you . Your character & passion speaks louder than it did before and on man time..

I see you. Love.
3058 2018-12-14 18:12:21 He blushes and smiles.

"Actually it's just some bath oil i bought in Kakariko a while back. I have an extra bottle if you'd like it."
3059 2018-12-14 18:12:19 agreed!
3060 2018-12-14 18:12:18 Saute green onions in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add cod fillet and red wine. Cook thoroughly. Serve with cooked risotto and a bit of Worcester sauce.
3061 2018-12-14 18:12:17 Let me google how much oil changes gonna be & shit before I get this car 
3062 2018-12-14 18:12:11 I thought you were a contrarian.  But now that I think about it, maybe you were raised with extra baby  powder and oil. 
3063 2018-12-14 18:11:37 Errr.. you adopted Harper’s carbon reduction targets after mocking them, then took no action to even come close to meeting them while handing out billions to big oil. #flushthelibcons #cdnpoli
3064 2018-12-14 18:11:30 "We put poison in the earth to replace the oil we took out it's no big deal."
3065 2018-12-14 18:11:21 Afghanistan, is where all the poppy fields are. It is not as much about oil, as it is about drug.s
3066 2018-12-14 18:11:19 Lemsip, Olbas Oil, Wasabi Peas, hot water bottle. Come at me Phlegm, you sniffly bastard.
3067 2018-12-14 18:11:13 the fact that they are so INEFFECTIVE in their attacks is my favorite part. Go ahead, call the only black woman running a "cop" and call the candidate who refused all PAC money "in the pockets of big oil" 
Literally couldn't have chosen anything with more backfire potential
3068 2018-12-14 18:11:12 @MalickViews very important prog on energy crisis...how mafia designed the shortage of gas and trapped govt to switch to furnace oil...#dangerous 
Petroleum ministry needs replacement 
PM shud bring out petroleum policy and investigate as how this mafia is minting money
3069 2018-12-14 18:11:08 Trump clowning, buffooning @ his idiot rallies..."who is going to pay for the proverbial WALL"? Oh Mexico is paying, Mexico, Mexico. Now, perhaps Big Pharma. Big Insurance Co, Big Oil, Big Dfense Contractors,  Big Farmers & the rest of the elite capitalist billionaires can Pay!
3070 2018-12-14 18:11:08 Again, they would live better if that was so. Things wernt always expensive then, and if you would just give more than 2 cents, than maybe they would live nicer. Although, not everything you do is bad, since you dont do anything good.
3071 2018-12-14 18:11:03 Oh, come on...wasn't that all coincidance theory? or NOT!
You said it, I keep saying it:
BIG BRANDS SYSTEMATICALLY POISON US with food, drugs, cosmetics, perfumes, fibres, construction insulations, paints, glues, almost any oil product etc. We are so naive. No more! #MAGA
3072 2018-12-14 18:11:02 How do you know that their my workers? I wasn't the one who made such bad houses for them.
3073 2018-12-14 18:10:20 Without them you couldn't be rich. Without them you would be as low class as @Larry_Mutton and @DejaMcintyre4.

3077 2018-12-14 18:10:09 If GE wants to survive, they will need to amputate and regrow. Invest in Renewable tech Oil is out. We should be rooting for them, they are an old company that deserves a chance, but they have some massive changes to make.
3078 2018-12-14 18:10:09 It is pretty obvious why the legislation is bad.  Foreign billionaires want the oil sands completly shut down for a variety of reasons, none good for Canada.
3079 2018-12-14 18:10:06 At a car dealership in the waiting area...

Man 1: You're all dressed up, what's the deal?!!!

3085 2018-12-14 18:09:46 Ryan, separating from Canada means we won't need to get a pipeline built because, with no incentive to buy Alberta oil, they'll just buy it from the Saudis or the US instead.

3094 2018-12-14 18:09:10 So running your engine at higher rpms than idling before it's warmed up can cause increased wear to your valve train. Not to mention if there was any residual fuel in the cylinder then it essentially washes of the oil from the cylinder walls so those need to be re lubricated. 2/2
3095 2018-12-14 18:08:51 Apparently it has peppermint oil in it. I am assuming in a vain attempt at flavoring?
3096 2018-12-14 18:08:39 Coconut Oil 
3097 2018-12-14 18:08:38 wait... two weeks ago you basically said “Meh, cheap oil is too important to care that the Saudis murdered a US resident inside their embassy in Turkey” 

Flip-Flop much?

How about flip-flipping on being so enamored with @realDonaldTrump ? & get onboard with #IMPEACHMENT

3098 2018-12-14 18:08:37 China posted terrible data early this morning and instead of buying Gold and Oil backed Yuans they bought Dollars instead... Where is our friend to tell us about #dedollarization ?
3099 2018-12-14 18:08:23 Putin said that they didn't want the oil prices to go too high and they don't want to hurt the oil facilities by going too low. I agree we need to go electric, sustainable. Russia is relying less on oil and more on things like agriculture each year. It's gradual.
3100 2018-12-14 18:08:13 And they get paid.
3101 2018-12-14 18:08:12 Lone Star Olive Ranch has ALWAYS operated with this philosophy. You will know that our oil is 100% Texas, the Harvest date and the lot number.  We make the extra efforts for traceability.  

Know your food, insist on transparency, READ YOUR BACK LABELS.
3102 2018-12-14 18:08:10 Baby Oil...from petroleum? Really. 
Think about it people!
3103 2018-12-14 18:08:05 Corporate monopolies are still bad. You still should pay your workers more. If you are so concerned with their welfare, why do they still live in the slums?
3104 2018-12-14 18:08:01 If it's a real essential oil then it doesn't but I don't know that when I smell it so I get anxious anyway worrying about it. Most "essential oils" are fake, blends of synthetic fragrance diluting some essential oils.
3105 2018-12-14 18:08:00 getting my oil changed and they did the air filters too and apparently one of them is hidden in the pits of mordor
3106 2018-12-14 18:07:59 Yep, and I'm even more troubled than usual this year because of palm oil, as well. Have already told a friend I won't be buying her #FerreroRocher, as I've done every year for longer than I can remember. #PointlessPlastic #PalmOil

"fancy a bit of anal later?"

Wife looks at me in disgust as I have just roared this at her in a packed tesco...

I come back after looking for lube..

"I'm not paying €10 for lube.. There's cooking oil at home"

I'm not allowed go shopping any more
3109 2018-12-14 18:07:50 Most of my list is accomplished except an oil change and it’s just after 1. 
3110 2018-12-14 18:07:50 and you are revealing just how unscientific the arguments against the pipeline are. I appreciate the honesty. I wish everyone in this debate was this honest. Interesting how Chinese tankers filled with chemicals don’t affect sacred whales. Only Alberta oil does. @jonkay
3111 2018-12-14 18:07:47 I would but I gotta get my oil changed
3112 2018-12-14 18:07:46 So can you really tell a difference Amber? My wife got some cbd from somewhere else and it was a no go. I'm wondering if it was because we can't do THC. I just don't want to buy more snake oil you know.
3113 2018-12-14 18:07:44  Hmm, a good model to follow if you want to cover your  tracks. I lived in a town steeped in mob history and yet I had never heard of Corleone’s olive oil company. You are a font of criminal wisdom.

3115 2018-12-14 18:07:25 Yeah you're right STEM is so much harder than the humanities or arts. Why dont you pick up some more languages then because it's a valuable skill and it's super easy. Or better yet man how bout you make me a 26×32 oil painting and I'll pay you 5$
3116 2018-12-14 18:07:10 ICE OEMs/Big Oil are perpetrating $ trillions in fraud WW on consumers by denying hugely damaging impacts of ICE on our health and ecosystems 

that's perfectly clear with Tesla's products now on the market

and some call Elon a fraud? 
nothing could be further from the truth
3117 2018-12-14 18:07:03 If your complaining about poor people living in bad houses, you need to acknowledge how much money I give them. Not everything I do is bad and negatively impactful.
3118 2018-12-14 18:06:59 You need a sharp, thin knife. Sharp as you can get it. Wet the blade LIGHTLY with water or olive oil before cutting, that helps too. You should never have to saw, but use confident pressure when cutting maki. Too much trouble may mean you overfilled your roll.
3119 2018-12-14 18:06:58 First term is over now!

Now to stay a few extra days for a conference, head back home, and do an oil tanker's worth of work over Christmas break.

3121 2018-12-14 18:06:49 So, the @IndyEleven will play in Saint Louis for the first time to open the season on March 9th, then will head to Charlotte on March 15th before opening their 2nd season at Lucas Oil against Hartford on March 30th. Be there.
3122 2018-12-14 18:06:34 Then they should sack him as he gave them the only piece of real estate in the region without oil!
3123 2018-12-14 18:06:23 Apostolic leaders should never sell themselves short by borrowing oil from other houses when you poured out your own oil in your house. Train, equip, and release your people. Sow into them and STOP  spreading your seeds over fields God never told you to sow into.

3126 2018-12-14 18:06:02 and once you do, can you pay more than 2 cents?
3127 2018-12-14 18:05:57 Eh. Modern car engines have overhead valves and that happens to be the last part of an engine usually to get lubrication so when you start your car up and it's cold the oil is more viscous and thins as it heats up. It takes some time until everything is properly lubricated. 1/2
3128 2018-12-14 18:05:54 That explains why the American military are illegally occupying the oil rich areas of Syria?

3145 2018-12-14 18:04:52 You could actually pay your workers. That would be a start.
3146 2018-12-14 18:04:51 #StopNordStream2, raising gas and oil embargo against Russia and imposing toughest sanctions are the only way to show that EU means what it says to Russia. Everything else will be considered as weakness.
3147 2018-12-14 18:04:25 Use the money I donated to the government and tenement owners to give them a better life. My money isn't helping them because it never reaches where it needs to be.
3148 2018-12-14 18:04:24 Given the reality of climate change and environmental destruction investing in oil isn’t a win for anyone
3149 2018-12-14 18:04:20 I love it when people feel the same way I do about my products  this luxe oil is everything! It makes me super happy when people I personally know support me 
3150 2018-12-14 18:04:09 Baker Hughes Rig Count: U.S. -4 to 1,071 rigs: 

U.S. Rig Count is down 4 rigs from last week to 1,071, with oil rigs down 4 to 873 and gas rigs unchanged at 198.

U.S. Rig Count is up 141 rigs from last year's count of 930, with oil rigs up 126 and gas rigs up 15.
3151 2018-12-14 18:04:08 is that why you named it.  Cuz you can't accept loss
3152 2018-12-14 18:04:03 Is that why you keep arguing that you're not a robber?
3153 2018-12-14 18:04:01 The carriers rarely own the cars. They are either leased or owned by the oil companies, or in the near future, the Canadian government. The big selling points are additional capacity and the routing flexibility. Moving oil to the East and West Coasts of the US requires rail.
3154 2018-12-14 18:03:57 losing money to YOU?
3155 2018-12-14 18:03:56 Can ya accept losing you're whole family and an ARM?

3163 2018-12-14 18:02:41 Suggest you get a dictionary.  Secondly I suggest you look up the meaning of democracy.  Thirdly, you should consider Blair's role in the Iraq war where he lied about 'weapons of mass destruction' to engage in an bloody war about oil and power.

3215 2018-12-14 17:58:46 Similar to every businessman ever, the workers I hire automatically have an oppurtunity to make a living. Paying people allows them to work for a better, more sustainable life, and if they don't work, they don't get paid.

3228 2018-12-14 17:57:40 Read the Supreme Court suit where @fairquestions sued Observer Media, which itself accepts American Foundation funding, for libel when they continually accused her of being financed by oil companies.

Nothing gets your base fired up like being pragmatic! Let’s roll back tax cuts on the rich by a little bit! And we can reduce our subsidies to oil companies if they say it’s okay! pragmatism,fuck yeah!
3230 2018-12-14 17:57:30 Their lack of insight might also provide clues.  Even buses need oil.

3232 2018-12-14 17:57:28 Sending you good vibes. Does CBD oil help settle it?
3233 2018-12-14 17:57:27 true that, true that, what do you have to say now
3234 2018-12-14 17:57:23 " The U.S. is still a net importer of oil to the tune of 4.0 million b/d"
3235 2018-12-14 17:57:20 For most businesses, an oil spill is a good analogy to data breach. You have this stuff worth $ but if put in the environment, it's v bad. But for Facebook, the analogy doesn't quite fit, because their business model actually is dumping that stuff into the ocean
3236 2018-12-14 17:57:18 Maybe some palm oil production, cotton fields and in case of a hard Brexit maybe some bananas too
3237 2018-12-14 17:56:58 Deals all over the place in resource stocks. What a time to be buying mining and oil/gas stocks in Canada. #buylowsellhigh is the name of the game!
3238 2018-12-14 17:56:56 International market ma oil sasta howa yahan mehngaiye asmaan ko chu rahi hay , jab int market ma oil mehenga hoga tabi govt subsidies daygi, what a good governance?
3239 2018-12-14 17:56:55 @elliotcoleman I kept getting trashed in Black Ops 4 by a guy called Good_Tiger666.... if Snake Oil wasn't SUCH a good you would have just lost yourself a fan pal
3240 2018-12-14 17:56:48 "Friendship and money: oil and water." 
#favourite #friendship quote 

#iloveairtel @airtelbuzz
3241 2018-12-14 17:56:47 Dip your wick, pay for the oil..
3242 2018-12-14 17:56:43 Where are your "donations to charity" going. @mr_oil_man @AndrewC09462884 @keebs104 are probably paying people to keep quiet about their illegal activities.
3243 2018-12-14 17:56:42 Destination Sunday:  Oil City, LA with Pastor Kent Rhoades.  Anticipating!!!
3244 2018-12-14 17:56:20 Oil and geopolitical strategy...
3245 2018-12-14 17:56:18 I stay mixing coconut oil in everything to not be ashy
3246 2018-12-14 17:56:17 Your current opentrades have interesting coverage in transportation, financials, and oil. #stocks #buildingwealth #StockMarket
3247 2018-12-14 17:56:11 I’m not attacking u I’m giving you perspective on why this is lazy... When Johnny Manziel hit his GF there was no perspective on his dad being an oil tycoon and how that played into it. Anybody can lose control and do stupid $hit... it’s not mutually exclusive to having a bad fam
3248 2018-12-14 17:56:10 ..one reason our oil is not bigger news, because we export 90% of our oil- then price is set by OPEC, then we buy our own oil.
3249 2018-12-14 17:56:09 Peanut oil also needed, because it makes the best French fries.
3250 2018-12-14 17:56:08 Oh, you use tea tree oil?
3251 2018-12-14 17:56:07 Are you sure, i dont think you know me, I get a lot of my respect from all of my workers, I give them an opportunity, u give them nothing.
3252 2018-12-14 17:55:36 Hi Paddy, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks, Donna.
3253 2018-12-14 17:55:32 Feels like one might not need the CBD oil if they just avoided the pizza 
3254 2018-12-14 17:55:30 I agree, 100%. And we should be doing everything we can to remove the need for oil in our country's survival. Right now oil and climate change are the two biggest threats to our country. #Resist and go solar. Go wind. Go wave. Go USA.
3255 2018-12-14 17:55:19 true that
3256 2018-12-14 17:55:12 What the protests should be about:

-end of corruption in governments.

-end the suppression of free and clean energy technologies through the various invention secrecy acts.

-no more MIC false wars for oil. Again see above.

-end of the petrodollar economy as per all of above.
3257 2018-12-14 17:55:10 Today's reading is fundamental word: Charlatan, a person falsely claiming to have special skills or knowledge( hoax, fraud, scammer, or hoaxer, snake oil salesman, film flammer ) ________ is a charlatan #insertnameasapprpriate
3258 2018-12-14 17:55:05 Thanks Phil, we'll all be there tonight with our family, keep an eye out for us, maybe she can help with the oil can.
3259 2018-12-14 17:54:58 Clove oil?? Where do you get it ?
3260 2018-12-14 17:54:54 @mr_oil_man I actually wrote something about your crappy business practices and how you treat your people. Want a steak with a side of E.Coli and rat foot?
3261 2018-12-14 17:54:52 I stand by my last tweet that truffle oil is the Axe body spray of the food world.
3262 2018-12-14 17:54:34 Olive oil, by itself, clogs them. But not if mixed with, or followed by, honey. And grape seed oil is the least clogging moisturizer I’ve ever found.

But you do you.
3263 2018-12-14 17:54:25 2/2 EU was able to pay for crude with € since early 2015 - that was the reason for € QE - but now US #OilStandard peg is in place, Europe needs a Plan B. Only option is joining China/Asia buyers in (unsustainable) buy-side cartel. Oil commodity market is now on its last legs
3264 2018-12-14 17:54:13 Sleep, get a hair cut, replace the oil pressure sensor on my truck, hang out at my moms house, watch football, and that's about it.  Have a great weekend.
3265 2018-12-14 17:54:13 I took cbd oil and got some of the best sleep ever.
3266 2018-12-14 17:54:03 Prayer is the oldest snake oil of all
3267 2018-12-14 17:53:46 @DejaMcintyre4 I agree! @flash_guess, @uptonsinclar34 and myself are working hard to help you get a better life!
3268 2018-12-14 17:53:31 Apologies, just saw this one. 
351,000 boepd, up 25%, capex probably $4B is, so depends on your oil deck how much excess. Obviously budgets are malleable this time of year but they are aided by spending in 2018 for 2019 vol gro.  Expect FCF (but less than Street has them at now).
3269 2018-12-14 17:53:30 I do. I reported on that.
3270 2018-12-14 17:53:25 He is a perennial oil bull. Has not learned his lesson- obviously
3271 2018-12-14 17:53:23 If your father's oil company can get taken over, I think it says something about your father's company, not mine.
3272 2018-12-14 17:53:12 if you actually give equal pay and treat me and everyone else like normal you fat swine.
3273 2018-12-14 17:53:12 Avocado oil homie
3274 2018-12-14 17:53:07 A Bunch of red necks waiting for a Jason Kenney Hail Mary are waiting for their X-mas miracle but It just won't happen . US shale will kill our oil industry if we don't get some more open markets then the US. No pipeline eh well Here's 7000 tankers then problem solved #cdnpoli

3279 2018-12-14 17:52:40 Maybe you would get respect if you would actually care about people in the factories
3280 2018-12-14 17:52:31 You all live in an oil painting!

3286 2018-12-14 17:51:59 You do realize no one believes anything you say anymore right?
China like NK who by the way remains being supported and oil being transferred at sea.. just Incase you were not aware..
Oh and Pecker and Cohen have both told your story. With paper trail Opps..

Took cash from big oil. Number 2 in Congress behind Cruz. Another crook/liar
3291 2018-12-14 17:51:39 Every time I go to the express oil change place I almost crash into the wall pulling out.. thank you to the guy for walking out and directing me you are the real MVP
3292 2018-12-14 17:51:36 It definitely too practice with me too. The 3rd time I did it it was better. Hair has to be soaking wet (spray bottle ok deck lol), rolled really taut, and like may some oil or a bit of leave in cream
3293 2018-12-14 17:51:24 Lo g story short... Couple of automotive geniuses replaced the motor oil in their car with WD-40, and ran the engine for as long as they could until the car blew up in flames. Awesome. I wonder if the police, firefighters & the insurance company thought it was a great idea 
3294 2018-12-14 17:51:18 Saudi Arabia is down to providing just 9% of our oil. Trump had nothing to do with it.
3295 2018-12-14 17:51:10 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
3296 2018-12-14 17:51:02 Lets see how long this oil change takes 
3297 2018-12-14 17:51:02 You're exposing the wrong people. Again, talk to the tenement owners, and the government, and the architects. Also, talk to the families with so many children who can't even support them.
3298 2018-12-14 17:50:56 The American people want CLIMATE action: stop selling our public lands for oil & gas drilling; accept the science rather than silencing it; aggressiveLu shift to clean energy rather than offshore drilling; protect forests and invest in REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE! #climatehope
3299 2018-12-14 17:50:52 Well if you pack meat you don't work for me. If you work for me you get respect.
3300 2018-12-14 17:50:49 yep.
3301 2018-12-14 17:50:41 But Beto only takes money from employees of big oil. EMPLOYEES!!!! <guzzles bottle of wine and lubes up vibrator/fleshlight>
3302 2018-12-14 17:50:39 Used veg oil
3303 2018-12-14 17:50:36 She will have to give up most of her house goods. clothes, and running shoes because they have petroleum products in them. Maybe she will tell us all to go back to wearing animal skins again. Oil helps bring us so many things that we take for granted in our daily lives.
3304 2018-12-14 17:50:22 Lmao.. engine oil or???
3305 2018-12-14 17:50:13 Some butter, heavy cream, a good spoon of coconut oil, hot coffee of course. Add in a bit of Stevia(been using about the top third of a soup spoon), a partial spoon of unsweetened cocoa and few drops of Peppermint extract. Blend(NOT STIR) enjoy.
3306 2018-12-14 17:50:02 Continuing that ridiculous law passed by Bush when we only REALLY get 9% of oil from them..we're alienating our main suppliers ...Canada.  that was then...this is NOW
3307 2018-12-14 17:50:01 the pigs in the picture get treated better than I do
3308 2018-12-14 17:49:54 I definitely used pink oil growing up.
3309 2018-12-14 17:49:43 1 million a year for my entire family.
3310 2018-12-14 17:49:32 I am here to expose the terrible living conditions and working conditions that you robbers @Themelonman4 @AndrewC09462884 @mr_oil_man I have to spend day night taking pictures
3311 2018-12-14 17:49:30 How did you live, with a soul? I dont think so.
3312 2018-12-14 17:49:21 Why? Because they hate Alta oil more.
3313 2018-12-14 17:49:20 snake oil salesman, I meant Trump crying wolf on (CHINA TRADE) beginning to be ignored... Hope trump and his entire family gets locked for their machinations
3314 2018-12-14 17:49:16 I can help with that if you like? Here: have some of my patented "Gwyneth Paltrow Was Never Good In Anything, At All, Ever" oil.
3315 2018-12-14 17:49:16 Capellini (thin hair) are the absolute thinnest you can find. Although they're meant for soup, if you ever have a chance to try them with some shredded sun-dried tomatoes and a dash of olive oil your heart will sing with joy.
3316 2018-12-14 17:49:09 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
3317 2018-12-14 17:49:01 If you don’t get me a discount on an oil change you go in the pond lol
3318 2018-12-14 17:48:49 You can trim a tree all you want, it will regrow in spring. Stop Globalist source of FREE money.....Recognize Hebrew Biafra the origin of most Black Americans=70% Black votes and Bankruptcy for Globalist.(FREE OIL AND GAS).
3319 2018-12-14 17:48:48 How did you write this, with an oil lamp? I think so.
3320 2018-12-14 17:48:47 @phynofino EZEGE Nwanne pls drop OIL official video Biko
3321 2018-12-14 17:48:47 ....and an oil change
3322 2018-12-14 17:48:41 So you treat your pigs with respect and give them money. Interesting...
3323 2018-12-14 17:48:41 Clear parallels between current era Mena, AR & former era Zapata Oil Gulf "listening posts" turned distribution points. 5-Rig Names: Scorpion, Vinegaroon, Sidewinder, Nola III, & Maverick.
New Orleans Mafia was US Entry Point. 

2 New Orleans Mafia hitmen were in Dallas (JFK).
3324 2018-12-14 17:48:41 I don't know which is worse an oil company or a group of unhinged Morons. A pipeline is the safest most economical means to transport oil and Gas.  So what do the Nimrods at Sierra Club propose in lieu of?
3325 2018-12-14 17:48:39 Oh gosh... let us small islands have something nah. Alyuh have oil and carnival already. Shit lol
3326 2018-12-14 17:48:36 1/2 OPEC has been a dead letter since 2001, when the power shifted definitively to US/UK ie Wall Street plus a couple of oil majors. Power will shift (probably for some time) to the buy-side, initially Asia Buyers' Club: when EU (15m bbl/day) jumps with Asia it's game over #OOTT

3329 2018-12-14 17:48:24 Standard oil steals money from small companies through illicit schemes with the railroads. Read my book! There's the proof! Justice for ALL!
3330 2018-12-14 17:48:03 Phil, im looking at the stock market, oil prices and so on and it’s going to be a thick heavy judgement and everything is  falling .
3331 2018-12-14 17:48:02 Tell that to the government, and the tenement owners, and the architects.
3332 2018-12-14 17:47:57 as for a topping- throw veggie oil in a pan with some onions and garlic [and any seasonings here that you would want], heat that up and then add your pasta.

literally if you WANT to start cooking, pasta would be the go to place to learn I think.
3333 2018-12-14 17:47:57 350 million, If that is how much you spent on a charity what do you spend on your food and a house
3334 2018-12-14 17:47:31 Micellar water pakai yang garnier punya warna pink tu best!!! Oil cleanser hada labo punya bestttttttt warna kuning

3338 2018-12-14 17:47:17 Our overall policies and leftist orgs are baiting these people in. 
The entire crisis is manufactured and people are being driven like cattle. 
These deaths/ suffering are not mourned by organizers but seen as positive propaganda furthering the cause
3339 2018-12-14 17:47:13 Ughhh I forgot my book. 2 hours for this oil change smh
3340 2018-12-14 17:47:01 how much does it cost yo to make pepperoni pizza at home??? $4/12 oz pepperoni, $2-4 for shredded Mozzarelli (sale & how much) , $2.50 can of tomato paste...spices, flour, yeast, honey, oil  ...
3341 2018-12-14 17:46:59 
3342 2018-12-14 17:46:55 You’re right and makes you wonder our   fascination with oil production given the devastation left behind eg tailing ponds orphan oil wells destroyed animal habitat to name a few
3343 2018-12-14 17:46:54 "This is what happens when science & engineering are joined"- @rstein357  on evolving research on the San Andreas fault line and the engineering behind the Transalaska pipeline: (7.9 mag Denali earthquake, not a drop of oil spilled. #AGU100 #AGU18

3345 2018-12-14 17:46:44 i  already know biden sleeps wit peoples real enemys in oil they  want slaves their day  is ending and throwing fit
3346 2018-12-14 17:46:44 I helped my workers I helped the poor. Again,  I gave 350 million in charity. What have u done?
3347 2018-12-14 17:46:29 I won't quote the Nordics if you wont quote Venezuela, because Venezuela is what happens when Norway (welfare state fueled by oil revenue) doesn't work out. The only difference between Norway and Venezuela is that Venezuela's economy was not diversified and they lacked democracy.

3357 2018-12-15 23:57:39 Incorrect, have a high school diploma, spent 40 years drilling oil wells all over the world. Supt on ultra Deepwater drillship. 1st year I passed $100k was in 95. Final year to retirement paid taxes on $478k, since 2014 live out of checkbook, retirement income (9K) starts in May.
3358 2018-12-15 23:57:37 After selling off our national treasures and heritage to big oil and gas with his pockets lined- good riddance!
3359 2018-12-15 23:57:16 This will be the legacy of Islam - turning what used to be the Indus Valley Civilization into a Pakistan, turning what used to be the Great Persian Civilization into an Iran & turning the Kashmir valley into a Mini Saudi Arabia (without oil) in the mountains.
3360 2018-12-15 23:57:15 Our gov't has clearly sold out to the oil industry.
3361 2018-12-15 23:57:13 It was a great way to start a day!

Have fun at the Oil kings game, and maybe scope out some prospect of the identity line!
3362 2018-12-15 23:57:13 And where was the fucking oil from that blew up and killed many and destroyed the town of Lac Megantic Quebec?

3365 2018-12-15 23:56:54 Good article. key issue is Revenue Allocation. Stop that & open the industry.

Immediately OBJ deregulated NEPA, FG contribution to Electric Power has reduced dramatically hence BRF made that truthful statement considered offensive today

Agreed similar reforms reqd in Oil & Gas!

3375 2018-12-15 23:57:48 You’ve seen my girl with a flame thrower? @DHanscum and I have been speculating if we could make one work with Holy oil as fuel... I don’t know what made me think of that just now...

3377 2018-12-15 23:57:39 Incorrect, have a high school diploma, spent 40 years drilling oil wells all over the world. Supt on ultra Deepwater drillship. 1st year I passed $100k was in 95. Final year to retirement paid taxes on $478k, since 2014 live out of checkbook, retirement income (9K) starts in May.
3378 2018-12-15 23:57:37 After selling off our national treasures and heritage to big oil and gas with his pockets lined- good riddance!
3379 2018-12-15 23:57:16 This will be the legacy of Islam - turning what used to be the Indus Valley Civilization into a Pakistan, turning what used to be the Great Persian Civilization into an Iran & turning the Kashmir valley into a Mini Saudi Arabia (without oil) in the mountains.
3380 2018-12-15 23:57:15 Our gov't has clearly sold out to the oil industry.
3381 2018-12-15 23:57:13 It was a great way to start a day!

Have fun at the Oil kings game, and maybe scope out some prospect of the identity line!
3382 2018-12-15 23:57:13 And where was the fucking oil from that blew up and killed many and destroyed the town of Lac Megantic Quebec?
3383 2018-12-15 23:57:11 Definitions change in oil living languages conservatives on no longer what they were
3384 2018-12-15 23:57:09 Zinke's out! Senators: please make sure the next Interior Secretary works to protect our National Parks, NOT to further Big Oil!
3385 2018-12-15 23:56:54 Good article. key issue is Revenue Allocation. Stop that & open the industry.

Immediately OBJ deregulated NEPA, FG contribution to Electric Power has reduced dramatically hence BRF made that truthful statement considered offensive today

Agreed similar reforms reqd in Oil & Gas!

3392 2018-12-15 23:55:46 He's been lousy as far as doing his job of protecting public lands. He can sell his soul for whatever the oil industry will pay him but he has destroyed our faith in the Interior Dept's protection of our national parks and wildlife.
3393 2018-12-15 23:55:18 Man, what are you going to do when oil runs out? Carbon Tax would finance renewable energy competitiveness. Make things future ready. Hill Billies in SK and AB don't like facing the future.
3394 2018-12-15 23:55:16 Dear ashy people,

go to the store, buy a tub of coconut oil, apply a generous amount after ur next shower and rinse any excess with cold water. Repeat for 21 days bc that's how long it takes to make something a habit.

P.s. snitches get stitches does not apply to rape victims.
3395 2018-12-15 23:54:58 Ok. #protip for you all. When you estimate how much oil you’re taking.  Please use an eye dropper and measure. Don’t guess. You will truly mess yourself up. #hookupwentsouth
3396 2018-12-15 23:54:57 I need to buy more oil paints bc I ran out of one fucking colour arghh
3397 2018-12-15 23:54:45 due date wrapping up + desperation and the OK from my doctor led me to drinking castor oil about an hour ago.
3398 2018-12-15 23:54:43 I realised that most my Illnesses was probably due to docs feeding me drugs. Flu jabs etc I will NEVER touch another drug. I can heal with natural substances! Also oil of oregano is great! I just can’t stomach the oil form so waiting on tablets 
3399 2018-12-15 23:54:39 Oil & Vinegar starving artist
3400 2018-12-15 23:54:30 Ok so if you have a sore throat use tea tree oil and guard to gargle! It works! It’s a miracle! #homeopathy #selfcare
3401 2018-12-15 23:54:21 @Nikki_Bitchhh bought me this fancy ass essential oil set for Christmas. I love her so much. 
3402 2018-12-15 23:54:05 I would love to help out & I would sponsor her a nice high dose CBD full spectrum oil, and I promise she will be smiling whole Christmas 
3403 2018-12-15 23:53:55 No date. No location. No context.
Do you think that war would cease if the world didn't use oil? 
Do you think that all of our present armed conflicts concern oil? How about past wars?
Has there ever been a time that mankind has been free of war?
3404 2018-12-15 23:53:47 Gun oil and whatever he ate last, probably something gamey that had to be hunted
3405 2018-12-15 23:53:47 Oil.oil.oil.Did you turn the profit of that down?
3406 2018-12-15 23:53:45 and if that is true, are you saying we should let them blackmail us: sell us weapons or we stop producing oil? How long could THEIR economies last if they stopped pumping oil? Saudi has NOTHING else to export!
3407 2018-12-15 23:53:36 i know some of y’all out there driving a beat down 2002 hooptie with cracked leather seats,

come trade that hoe in at sands chevy wit me asap 
3408 2018-12-15 23:53:29 Well, I cane from AB where they worship Oil Cos so maybe it just looks that way to me. It’s nice to be among people whose values lie with critical thinking skills.
3409 2018-12-15 23:53:25 Take an epsom salt bath with some lavender essential oil infused and breathe  I love you.
3410 2018-12-15 23:53:18 さぶろ~誕生日おめでとう！！！
3411 2018-12-15 23:53:17 Is it made in desi ghee or olive oil?  
3412 2018-12-15 23:53:16 who is on the left....not your brother?
3413 2018-12-15 23:53:13 He has a flair for snake oil sales, it’s got to be said. #auspol
3414 2018-12-15 23:52:59 I like it when its heavily cooked in oil
3415 2018-12-15 23:52:59 I said I admire Albertans especially after the ignorant Quebec Premier said Alberta oil was unacceptable. Alberta took it well , I would still be seething
3416 2018-12-15 23:52:49 If we had oil dai America yakauya kudhara
3417 2018-12-15 23:52:45 Well, let's be honest. John Major isn't exactly Mr dynamic, but Tony Blair is a slimy snake oil salesman and the man who took the UK into an illegal war which killed hundreds of thousands of people. No comparison.
3418 2018-12-15 23:52:40 Standard blather from the can't see beyond next month crowd. Oil may be needed to manufacture some products for some time into the future, however it can & will be phased out as a heating & vehicle fuel. Shipping it overseas for short term profit isn't worth the pipeline risks
3419 2018-12-15 23:52:33 No one qualified will want it so it will go to a lobbyist that want to drill for oil in the Grand Canyon.
3420 2018-12-15 23:52:26 you're a charlatan and a snake oil salesman
3421 2018-12-15 23:52:16 Oh come on,cut him some slack. As much as he ran according to what he believed, he was running in TEXAS, for gods sake."Big oil" is a huge part of our economy here, and employs a lot of people, like it or not. He was running to represent all Texans. I'd say he threaded the needle
3422 2018-12-15 23:52:12 Send dumplings with chili oil please
3423 2018-12-15 23:51:57 And then onto his benefactors in the oil and gas industry.
3424 2018-12-15 23:51:20 Very nice picture and see !!..the pin stripe suit.
And if you ever want some bottled water Alex...he is ya man.
Malvern 
3425 2018-12-15 23:51:18 I'd show up with peanut oil and french fries.
3426 2018-12-15 23:51:13 He moved to open more coastal waters, public lands for oil & gas leasing, recommended the shrinking of as many as four national monuments, initiated the rollback of a number of Obama-era environmental regs which industry Republican lawmakers had criticized being overly burdensome
3427 2018-12-15 23:50:57 After Indy, we should,  turn off the oil, water, electricity, that we export foc atm to Englandshire, lets see how they get on !!!!

Not good is my guess
3428 2018-12-15 23:50:57 oil me by your bibliography and i'll oil you by mine
3429 2018-12-15 23:50:44 [RTRS] - MEXICAN FINANCE MINISTER SAYS 2019 OIL HEDGE IS IN PLACE, DONE 'VERY REASONABLY'
3430 2018-12-15 23:50:42 Its not enough. And after finding out how many oil lobbyists were involved in drafting the agreement I am even less impressed. Need bolder action.
3431 2018-12-15 23:50:40 Clearly you haven’t read the agenda. Climate change is a false narrative. You think if we lower our carbon footprint by stopping gas and oil production will change anything? What they didn’t tell you is we would buy it from countries that are not a super power after paying them t
3432 2018-12-15 23:50:33 What an active day for me          
Oil change done  
Spark plugs done 
3433 2018-12-15 23:50:33 やっぱ、芸人って天才よね笑笑
3434 2018-12-15 23:50:31 Mum had finally posted my oud rose oil  can’t wait to try it and prayyy it sorts out my hair!!
3435 2018-12-15 23:50:28 annnnd oil is Alberta's - what's your point in this thread?
3436 2018-12-15 23:50:25 Oil burns are the worse bruh
3437 2018-12-15 23:50:10 hella risky, I’d be drowned with anointing oil
3438 2018-12-15 23:50:06 What did people call having a photographic memory before 1848? Oil painting?
3439 2018-12-15 23:49:54 So I haven’t checked the oil from my car and lmao my brother just got after me :))))) bc it doesnt have any!
3440 2018-12-15 23:49:52 Balsamic, olive oil & soy sauce the family will never support you being a lesbian.

yeah I bet
3442 2018-12-15 23:49:43 They really had the oil jumping out the pan on him
3443 2018-12-15 23:49:41 The US always ignored the nations they did not have a juicy trade agreement with. That country was and is at war almost the whole time since it declared independence, "liberating oil" is an international joke for a reason. Nobody thinks about the US and say, yes they have hearts.
3444 2018-12-15 23:49:36 Snake Oil Salesman
3445 2018-12-15 23:49:26 Hear you, but unfortunately some of these people only have their own interests at heart. Like in the oil patch, you have no trouble hearing/reading about "the analyst" that's calling for WTI to go to $20 or $150, but if they call $50? No shock factor there so it gets brushed over
3446 2018-12-15 23:49:20 I’m bringing out my oil rig tonight. It’s been a while since some dabs 
3447 2018-12-15 23:49:18 Can I ask how you take it? I started about a month ago & I don't notice a difference at all. I've read that it doesn't pass the blood/brain barrier unless taken in conjunction with something like grapeseed oil. Mine is from GNC. Thanks.
3448 2018-12-15 23:49:14 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
3449 2018-12-15 23:48:54 If Saudi Arabia go against us we will haft to move all of those military bases and the price of oil could reach 200 per. Barrel that's around 5 to 7 dollars per gallon 
Think about that
3450 2018-12-15 23:48:48 Damn, you people are stupid. Name a single policy by the Trump administration and his EPA run by climate science deniers and the coal/oil industry that has helped improve air quality.
3451 2018-12-15 23:48:29 Vinegar and Oil Brainwashed by the Leftist Agenda
3452 2018-12-15 23:48:19 If you call ravaging our federal lands to help his cronies in oil and coal, then good on him ( not)..
3453 2018-12-15 23:48:15 Went to @sproutsfm and other store and I am unable to find carrots not grown with oil wastewater! So frustrating!
Only #CalOrganic and Grimmway out there! Ugh!  
3454 2018-12-15 23:48:13 "President Obama blocked Interior from releasing any land for coal mining. Zinke, by contrast, has sped up the process of obtaining these leases for new oil and gas drilling." What was Obama's action considering oil and gas? You're comparing oranges with apples here...
3455 2018-12-15 23:48:08 Drilling down into the EIA's 2019 forecast
The EIA's latest oil market outlook anticipates that the global oil benchmark, Brent, will average $61 a barrel in 2019. Meanwhile, it sees WTI, the U.S. oil benchmark, averaging about $54 a barrel next year. Motley story
3456 2018-12-15 23:48:01 คิดแบบนี้ก็อย่าอยู่ด้วยกันทั้งที่มึฃผิด ประสาท
3457 2018-12-15 23:47:54 And regards to industries like the oil and nonrenewables should also go under as well and those that will lose their job, the government should fund their retraining in those emerging technologies. That's what a government should do worry about the people not companies
3458 2018-12-15 23:47:43 I lost my fucking biosilk oil.
3459 2018-12-15 23:47:39 putting so much coconut oil in my hair was a mistake bc i just feel greasy and horrible now... tomorrow i gotta wash it out properly
3460 2018-12-15 23:47:28 The words, 'snake, oil and salesman' come to mind!
3461 2018-12-15 23:47:12 Oregano oil is great for cuts & ingrown nails but very painful on the skin. I wouldn’t use it for massage.
3462 2018-12-15 23:47:06 Take a look at the cartoon. The graph is a respond for the cartoon that implies that Quebec does not buy oil from AB.
3463 2018-12-15 23:46:52 Oil and Vinegar, oil and vinegar
3464 2018-12-15 23:46:43 Oil, international waters, renewables, water. Please do.
3465 2018-12-15 23:46:25 No disagreement there. However, there are lots of other Canadians that were sucketed into buying oil patch:  unsustainably high dividend yields, rubbish fixed income products.... that made certain IBankers & oil exec's fabulously wealthy. When those guys complain it's a bit rich.
3466 2018-12-15 23:46:23 the environment and Quebec can hardly be taken as contributing to Confederation. But of course, all the money they waste buying expensive foreign oil they get back in Equalization payments, so what do they care!
3467 2018-12-15 23:46:18 Let's send Quebec oil instead of equalization payments, thus saving them from buying Saudi oil.
If they don't like that, sweet fuck all is another good option.
3468 2018-12-15 23:46:05 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
3469 2018-12-15 23:46:00 Since when does Shell know that burning oil will lead to the climatecrisis?
3470 2018-12-15 23:46:00 And they should. A snake oil salesman doesn’t deserve any followers.
3471 2018-12-15 23:45:56 Real men of Alaska  call me oil cause I’m ready to be drilled 
3472 2018-12-15 23:45:52 Hope the government starts drilling for oil in your front yard.
3473 2018-12-15 23:45:50 I think Republicans are obsessed with oil because they're so crusty
3474 2018-12-15 23:45:36 But Chuck! A former oil & gas lobbyist to take Zinke’s place?  Is there no end to the swamp creatures with interests other than ours?
3475 2018-12-15 23:45:35 So long as TX’s 38 electoral votes are the cornerstone of the GOP electoral coalition, they will chase oil, and we’ll need to outflank them on climate measures.

The purpling of TX is the greatest opportunity we have to get real movement on climate. 2/2
3476 2018-12-15 23:45:28 It occurs to me that the same hostile foreign actors and their trollbot armies, combined with far right propagandists funded by Big Coal and Oil, are trying to incite unrest in Canada's Bible Belt just like they did in the US Rust Belt. The Prairies are being manipulated by...

3484 2018-12-15 23:44:28 The cooking oil was to keep it from rusting on the inside.
3485 2018-12-15 23:44:28 I think it does matter where Que gets its oil. By buying foreign oil at full price whilst devaluing Canadian oil, that is $ ripped directly from the Canadian economy. Not rocket science. Add the hypocrisy of buying from countries with poor treatment of women, human rights and

3487 2018-12-15 23:44:11 After MONTHS of being devastated about the grocery store situation in DC, today I discovered an Italian grocery store which is 25% pasta, 25% olive oil, 25% salami and 25% wine. I am still emotional about it.
3488 2018-12-15 23:44:09 I apparently hotboxed my bathroom w oil so much that it ended up smelling like actual oil, which isn’t supposed to happen
3489 2018-12-15 23:44:00 I taught to wash it by hand, dry it on a burner on the stove, and wipe the inside it with a tiny bit of cooking oil.  However, I wasn't taught to wash it in a dishwasher.
3490 2018-12-15 23:43:43 Yep, cleared some floor space and got the oil can out, yesterday !
Then went swimming, instead .....
3491 2018-12-15 23:43:42 I use mixed chicks and lots of oils. tea tree, coconut, olive oil and i also do hairs masks and hot oil treatments often.
3492 2018-12-15 23:43:34 Sure... industrialized nations with the population of New Jersey and North Sea oil pumping billons into the economy.. Their health systems send doctors to OUR med schools.  The rich come here for surgery.. Try again.
3493 2018-12-15 23:43:31 He doesn’t limit his food intake and does not track it. No need. He simply eats vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. No salt, no oil. His previous diet was the standard Atkins protocol.
3494 2018-12-15 23:43:20 Hey Frances. Please see @GretaThunberg and help fight for #climateaction. @jeremycorbyn rhetoric on #ClimateChange totally contradicted by #Labour industrial policy & recent @johnmcdonnellMP commitments on North Sea oil. Please help highlight the hypocrisy. Thanks.

3497 2018-12-15 23:43:02 For 40 years I drilled oil wells internationally, the entire time had a Rolls Royce type group health. Carried it on Cobra for 18 months after I retired. Looked around & a garbage policy $3500 deductible each at 80% hospital no doc, meds, eye or dental was $2,950 per month.

3506 2018-12-15 23:42:04 Same with the fact the US is oil independent first time in 75 years as of a couple weeks ago.
3507 2018-12-15 23:41:56 They will be useless in 50 years. Renewables have taken off. Whole countries going to them for environmental and economic reasons. Oil and gas infrastructure pipelines will most likely be abandoned by their billionaire owners.
3508 2018-12-15 23:41:55 Grand MA will soon give you Goya Oil to drink again
3509 2018-12-15 23:41:32 Offshore Oil worker and same. They talk about Scotland and our progressive government as if this is a bad thing. Shame the rUK didn't adopt more of their policies.
3510 2018-12-15 23:41:18 He was trying to help You... You said you were diversifing the economy  .... And depending less on oil... Isn't it...  Now you are saying he lied.... You must be a fool!
3511 2018-12-15 23:41:18 Are you using oil?
3512 2018-12-15 23:41:06 I used vitamin e oil slathered after each shower and never got stretch marks
3513 2018-12-15 23:40:56 Oil & Vinegar They’re Either Dead or Dead to Me. 

I need a nickname.
3514 2018-12-15 23:40:50 I started oil painting again.
3515 2018-12-15 23:40:32 Well he likes pin stripe suits and speaks quite posh.
And he knows his oil alright.
Friendly man...my new mate.

3517 2018-12-15 23:40:30 Walmart what tf y’all doing it’s just an oil change
3518 2018-12-15 23:40:27 I love my bacon with some fish oil
3519 2018-12-15 23:40:24 World oil price is not on Canada, true. But the differential that’s costing us $80 million every single day sure is!
3520 2018-12-15 23:40:11 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3521 2018-12-15 23:39:43 And the British sided with and helped the Arabs to win wars and then get oil.
3522 2018-12-15 23:39:16 Oil, threats,  money & tons of Gas .... what could POSSIBLY GO WRONG!!!!
3523 2018-12-15 23:38:59 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
3524 2018-12-15 23:38:52 War was won by US Navy and US manufacturing & US Oil/refining. Why would do these asshats think catching the most bullets is some kind of achievement? Still looking for a warm water port to this day lol
3525 2018-12-15 23:38:50 @JenniferJJacobs H/T: Given the resignation and months of scandal, perhaps the order Zinke signed in Alaska with @lisamurkowski aiming to increase oil production in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska needs to be reviewed?
3526 2018-12-15 23:38:47 It will rust. After each use wipe the pan out. If there’s food debris on it, use a scrubber. When it’s clean, place it on the cooktop over a medium flame to dry. then wipe the whole pan with a paper towel with a little oil on it. After many uses, it becomes non stick. Magic.
3527 2018-12-15 23:38:34 Olbas oil is so weird like who found this weird smell that magically clears blocks noses?? I don’t understand where did it come from who invented it how did they discover it’s magical medicinal powers
3528 2018-12-15 23:38:31 Maduro, a true quote about what has been done to remove by self sufficiently in Venezuela, " They always want to control my oil to put me into debt servitude." I agree with him.
3529 2018-12-15 23:38:28 That oil is why he got those blackheads. #LRT

3530 2018-12-15 23:38:10 You have been fooled for years  Oil gas fuel deception Is real the human population does not or has ever needed to be dependent on Coal or fuels such as oil gas to travel The powers that be have used this idea as a way to control you  your freedom of movement around the world
3531 2018-12-15 23:38:09 ok my car’s oil is changed and ready for this week  jsjdnxm
3532 2018-12-15 23:38:07 A 270% tariff on foreign fossil fuels coming into Canada like we do for our Dairy industry on foreign milk/dairy products might be all the encouragement Irving Oil needs to BUY CANADIAN.
3533 2018-12-15 23:37:50 Ladies, who suffers from bad menstrual cramps? I heard my cbd oil is taking away the pain!!!!!
3534 2018-12-15 23:37:42 Now that US is great exporter of oil. Let’s get gas below $2.00 nationwide (except Ca) Thanks for all you & your staff do. Merry Christmas!  MAGA @POTUS @WhiteHouse @PressSec
3535 2018-12-15 23:37:22 Lavender, tea tree oil
3536 2018-12-15 23:37:18 @POTUS were you complicit in the tear-gas bombing in Syria (2016)? Looks a lot like @HillaryClinton & Libya situation (2011).

According to Russian foreign intelligence, it wasn't Assad -- as it appears you have more interest in acquiring Oil resources than securing the Border.
3537 2018-12-15 23:37:17 Bro I just had pure weed oil smh shit looked like miracle drops lol
3538 2018-12-15 23:37:06 VERY BETTER TAKE THAT SHIT TOO NEW OIL LEAN “OFFSET” VOICE

~2mbd currently
3544 2018-12-15 23:36:37 @NancyPelosi ... we as Americans deserve more than being hijacked by big oil bullshit. 2015 opened thousands of well heads yet prior to that gas was less than 5.00 at the wellhead. The American's are getting screwed...
3545 2018-12-15 23:36:34 All that bitching about Trudeau importing Saudi oil and it turns out Canada doesn’t import ANY oil.... Corporations do!
3546 2018-12-15 23:36:23 Use ice or any hair oil 
Makes it slide off
3547 2018-12-15 23:36:17 Season with salt and pepper, wrap in prosciutto, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with rosemary, bake at 425° for 20-30 minutes. (Depending on thickness.)
3548 2018-12-15 23:36:10 Beto is not progressive enough and would be another oil monger. Quit trying to push us on him. If he cant beat Cruz he will not beat Trump.
#ThankYouNext
3549 2018-12-15 23:36:07 Tried a different CBD oil today & it feels like Im betraying @JoeVargas #NeverAgain #BigMistake #IPreferCloud9
3550 2018-12-15 23:36:06 Vinegar and Oil Gay Artist
3551 2018-12-15 23:35:50 This doesn’t always work well. “Vinegar and Oil I’m Overweight” is a terrible stripper name. 
Let’s see if I can do better.
3552 2018-12-15 23:35:49 I really ate this oil down under 15 minutes
3553 2018-12-15 23:35:28 Fall/Winter Sunset + smell of fried oil/funnel cake + PS2 arcade games = bliss
3554 2018-12-15 23:35:27 If your hair is dull, mix a few drops of tea tree oil with your shampoo! Works wonders 
3555 2018-12-15 23:35:27 I’m all for any alternatives to burning coal oil or gas that doesn’t create more headache. I recall in 1980s science class that nuclear waste was a problem. Has that problem been resolved?
3556 2018-12-15 23:35:16 I love you, Madame Speaker to be, but "special interests"?  Call them out for who they are - greedy oil and gas and mining interests.  We Democrats need to bury that euphimism and speak clearly about those we're up against.
3557 2018-12-15 23:35:14 Our tax dollars should be paying for our healthcare and not for wars that benefit big oil.
3558 2018-12-15 23:34:57 The oil industry pays very little taxes. Because it gets special tax credits along with tons of direct and indirect subsidies to the industry.  You and I and everyone else pays the price.
3559 2018-12-15 23:34:55 Please do not attempt to mislead. The NEB website craftily omits the actual detailed % of oil from Alberta vs outside Canada feeding the refineries in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. As well, the cartoon was not specifically referring to Quebec, but all Central/Eastern Cdn
3560 2018-12-15 23:34:41 I haven’t produced artwork in forever but I’ve got all the sketchbooks, canvases oil paints etc in the world
3561 2018-12-15 23:34:24 Oil
3562 2018-12-15 23:34:18 He's a shysters, a snake oil salesman. Takes the EU's money for all these years.
A hypocrite of the first order. Taking orders from a higher power I believe (Not God)
3563 2018-12-15 23:34:15 This is getting old.  Why don't you just give it a rest. You'd have to be an idiot to fail to recognize that $15 oil for any period of time is a killer for the overall Canadian economy.  We know how to fix it and we need to move obstructionists out of the way.  Hat fits, wear it.
3564 2018-12-15 23:34:07 Benzos, It's the ultimate Bitch. Group stuff helps. Listen. NA, AA, use CBD oil
6 months ago. Still battling.
3565 2018-12-15 23:34:05 Oily skin? It's still OK to use cream foundation. Apply it with a damp makeup sponge, which picks up the pigment but not the product's oil.
3566 2018-12-15 23:33:58 If they don't think our oil is "Socially responsible" enough then remove it from the equalization formula. We get to keep the other 50% in our province and bam the budget is balanced.
3567 2018-12-15 23:33:56 Say word.  What u drinkin... Castor oil?? 
3568 2018-12-15 23:33:44 I'm currently using sunny isle's Jamaican black castor oil intensive repair masque and organics' hair Mayonese for deep conditioning, I highly recommend.
3569 2018-12-15 23:33:40 Oil and Vinegar Bad With Money (btw this is a trash name...but then so is the idea of making a joke out of strippers who frankly deal with enough shit)
3570 2018-12-15 23:33:27 ever since my facial, i smell like tea tree oil 
3571 2018-12-15 23:33:19 @NancyPelosi it's a problem with big oil restricting oil in the form of price control. It was a HUGE MISTAKE to allow American energy to be sold outside the country. Big oil makes crazy profits and wouldn't be hurt by stopping the export of American energy...
3572 2018-12-15 23:33:18 Best thing to clean them is a fire pit. Throw it in until it’s clean and then put oil in it to re season it. Crazy how many people don’t know that you need to do that.
3573 2018-12-15 23:32:33 darkskins are only “pretty” to y’all when they have a photo shoot with oil all over them
3574 2018-12-15 23:32:22 A cheaper version of doTerra/Deep Blue. Look up the essential oil blend, buy them at Bulk Apothecary (online), and $10 fractionated coconut oil on Amazon etc. Put a couple of drops of ea into the oil and it will last forever. Much cheaper & bigger portion sizes. I have RA/PA/OA
3575 2018-12-15 23:32:17 Ah I’m sorry, I lost my mom in January. I read her Leonard Cohen’s poetry, played Judy Garland’s Over The Rainbow & Bach. I put peppermint oil on her lips & rose shea lotion on her arms, legs and face. It perked her up. I also gave her CBD tincture and it helped. Love & light 
3576 2018-12-15 23:32:05 With an oil lobbyist in his place! Lucky us, swamped drained. Wasn’t that always the endgame for all these “Trump appointments?”
3577 2018-12-15 23:32:01 I actually take proper oil and STILL don’t sleep 
3578 2018-12-15 23:31:49 yeah but mix it with a little oil
3579 2018-12-15 23:31:43 Now the approach you took, did it yield the desired result?
3580 2018-12-15 23:31:39 Saw a guy using a traffic cone to put oil in his car on the side of the road today
3581 2018-12-15 23:31:35 Oil of Oregano has been a life saver this year in my fight against asthma!
3582 2018-12-15 23:31:17 Actually the oil will be very good for the cat, helps with hairballs 
3583 2018-12-15 23:31:09 Oil and vinegar kinda douchey
3584 2018-12-15 23:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and beaten to death with a hammer.

3594 2018-12-15 23:29:42 #disruption via EV's will mean the end to gas stations/ oil changes/ 80% of maintenance- spares. Going forward - winners - tires/ rims/wipers/cabin filters/ car cleaning. EV charging does not need humans in the loop - RE: #Tesla  supercharges - payment via the car. Huge changes
3595 2018-12-15 23:29:40 Anything with Argan oil in it
3596 2018-12-15 23:29:32 the likes of Pelosi and Shumer spend millions and waste time fighting Trump on every level, while the Saudi Emirates looks to the future w/o oil by bldg the experimental city of MASDAR.  We would be better off getting along and doing what the emirate is doing..They will survive.
3597 2018-12-15 23:29:27 Trump had nothing to do with fighting ISIS.

Market is volatile thank to his nonsense.

Border not secured - and no wall, with children separated per policy.

There hasn’t been war in korea since the early 1950s.

Obama was the one that increased our oil production.

... next?

3600 2018-12-15 23:29:11 If you work for the oil/gas industry, you are complicit in climate change and should be held criminally liable.

3605 2018-12-15 23:28:28 NYT coverage of Trump’s cabinet is a soap opera, one minute they’re like “TRUMP APPOINTS OIL LORD CRIMINAL TO EPA” then “TRUMP’S SECTREARY OF INTERIOR TIRED OF THIS BULLSHIT” and “TRUMP’S AG DROPS BC HE TATTLED ON DEAR LEADER”

3610 2018-12-15 23:28:04 Is Trump pushing US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices all part of the master plan to help Putin?
3611 2018-12-15 23:27:50 When Trump withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal gas prices went up but when those in the oil market realized that there were so many side deals around US sanctions the price dropped again. It seem Trump's Iran policy is mostly political theater.
3612 2018-12-15 23:27:34 I used to get my NY parents Gallo or Molinari dry salami, along with the aforementioned Ghirardelli chocolates and local olive oil.
3613 2018-12-15 23:27:32 COP24 agreed how to report carbon emissions but not how to close down the oil companies
3614 2018-12-15 23:27:31 Russophobe is a lucrative business in the west, second to oil 
3615 2018-12-15 23:27:23 Did you even read the site you linked to? It literally says “Eastern Canada imports significant volumes of crude oil to meet its refining needs”.
3616 2018-12-15 23:27:07 @BetoORourke is not a progressive. His donors are big oil and gas. What are his proposals in dealing with climate change? Let's face it, Beto lost to Ted Cruz. He should run for Senator Cornyn's seat in 2020 and flip TX blue.
3617 2018-12-15 23:27:06 I have bursitis up my spine, both shoulders & hips. Got an injection & it really really helped a lot! Also, I’m into doterra essential oils & they have this one called “deep blue” that is amazing! Comes in an oil or a tube of cream, fabulous stuff! Good wishes to her!

3624 2018-12-15 23:25:42 $1.5 billion annually worth of imported oil from Saudi Arabia is no small amount
3625 2018-12-15 23:25:41 Coast to coast tax money built up Alberta's Oil Industry? Selling our oil to buyers regardless of their origin is what we are supposed to do. Now if you wish to talk about Bombardier then we agree.
3626 2018-12-15 23:25:35 Oil's contributions to Canada's GDP aren't nearly as great as many people think.
3627 2018-12-15 23:25:35 Have you tried CBD oil it's the oil from a cannabis plant. It is legal and would help tremendously with the pain. I do hope she feels better soon. Take care of each other peace and love.
3628 2018-12-15 23:25:24 @SecretaryZinke You are a hideous fucking coward rapist creep, defiler of the Earth for profit.  Fuck you, you pitiful ugly douche tool of the oil and gas industry. You betray Americans, betray your own planet, betray your own grandchildren for your arrogance. Hell awaits you.

3632 2018-12-15 23:24:50 If you season it correctly, you can do that. Flax seed oil, heat, oil, heat, repeat until exhausted. Worth every second.
3633 2018-12-15 23:24:48 I really like Factorio, but I haven't played it in a while cause I always get stuck shortly after starting oil processing (cause it's so complicated and micromanage-y)
3634 2018-12-15 23:24:45 I’m eating kale and my dad goes “you know how to cook the best kale? Use coconut oil because it’s easier to slide into the garbage” lmfao I’m done.
3635 2018-12-15 23:24:42 Vegetable oil?
3636 2018-12-15 23:24:33 That’s true, but that oil is refined in New Brunswick, not Quebec.
3637 2018-12-15 23:24:33 anyone want to share a @ridebooker from the airport to @WhistlerBlckcmb @GoWhistler for the oil & gas investment conference? oh whats’s that @jacksoncrompton? Whistler is petroleum-free?
3638 2018-12-15 23:24:24 And now hopefully those unemployed will find an honest job.   Maybe pick vegetables in California, or work on an oil rig.   Perhaps they finally appreciate the value of unionizing.
3639 2018-12-15 23:23:56 I have to admit I have done this, I set out traps for a mouse I saw and caught it, but then took it out and used oil and let it go, glue traps are horrible.

3641 2018-12-15 23:23:52 Ummm, this is my first Oil Kings game ever, and was told to watch this kid. Well, so much for that. Guess I'll just eat my $10 rubber dog, and tweet.
3642 2018-12-15 23:23:43 Today is a great day for cleaning and clearing out your living space. Simmer some lime wedges, cinnamon, cloves and lemon oil to cleanse the stuffy winter home.

3644 2018-12-15 23:23:42 Responsible snake oil harvesting also promotes the conservation of endangered snake communities.
3645 2018-12-15 23:23:28 Now, we want to stop things and you expect us to carry microphone and share donut and fanta after? No, thank you.
3646 2018-12-15 23:23:25 His replacement is an oil/gas exec. You'll have to keep a close eye on him.
3647 2018-12-15 23:23:15 I think you mean a strong partner in helping oil companies get filthy rich while destroying any chance for future generations to live on a sustainable planet.
3648 2018-12-15 23:23:00 Fam this argan oil smells so peng

3650 2018-12-15 23:22:57 I can not trust ppl who take money from Israel, big oil, big banks, and prison complex.
No more corrupt politicians. No more sell-outs.
3651 2018-12-15 23:22:36 Allegations are just that- Allegations
Hats off to Zinke for Leading us to the World's Top Producer of Oil and Gas! May we keep on Fracking and become the Voice of Nations once again! 
Going from the depths of a  USA World of Low Self esteem! Thanks Pres Trump! We are Back!

3653 2018-12-15 23:22:30 Perfect. I have sugar and palm oil at hone
3654 2018-12-15 23:22:25 Oil is $50 per barrel.  And you come up with this?  Your anti Trump sentiment versus good business sentiment is showing loud and clear.  You are not the business channel anymore.
3655 2018-12-15 23:22:23 Damn straight I would @ItsJeminem a paddling pool, baby oil & 2 Toblerones we are good to go! 
3656 2018-12-15 23:22:03 my brother, who did nothing to take care of the kittens: oh, so now that WE'VE taken care of them, you're gonna take them away?
me, who paid for every vet visit, stayed awake all first 3 days taking care of them and shoved a qtip coated in oil up their butt to help them poop: ya
3657 2018-12-15 23:22:00 I didn't see them organising themselves and sharing leaflets when they decided it was okay to harass and objectify women or rape them. They never did it quietly to 'win our hearts'. They hurt us, oppressed us, destroyed our will to live.
3658 2018-12-15 23:22:00 Our oil and natural gas industry provides nearly one-third of the revenue for New Mexico's General Fund. #FactOfTheDay
3659 2018-12-15 23:21:47 Put sugar inside palm oil den lick. It works.

3662 2018-12-15 23:21:24 I didn’t know much about Marilyn Monroe so while I was getting my oil changed I watched videos about her and now I’m crying
3663 2018-12-15 23:21:23 Well, that was an eventful 3 hours just to get my oil changed. So glad there was someone around to check out and fix that unexpected issue.

3666 2018-12-15 23:20:52 Sure sharing leaflets and sweets to criminals will really get the job done
3667 2018-12-15 23:20:51 The UK denied us our independence We don’t need your aid!  You signed a contract for our oil worth billions then give us back 3.1m? Hypocrites! #TotalFreedomFor Ambazonia #AdressTheRootCauses #FreeSouthernCameroons #FreeAllArrested
3668 2018-12-15 23:20:36 Always remember the founding sponsors for the NBA were OKC’s oil & gas companies. Without them we are not #bigleague
3669 2018-12-15 23:20:36 It must be olive oil.

3672 2018-12-15 23:20:04 Why the hell would we be helping the Saudis do anything?? Let them use some of that oil money they’re rolling in.
3673 2018-12-15 23:19:41 Sorry #stream didn’t work out very well today so far.  I woke up late, had to do an oil change on the teleporter and now doing family christmas stuff. But I may fire it up a little later! Probs some #CSGO or #LoL. :)
3674 2018-12-15 23:19:37 My conclusion is not at all that we must get out of oil, nowhere have I said that. 

Doesn’t mean climate change isn’t being greatly effected by human activity.
3675 2018-12-15 23:19:33 I just got Tee tree oil in my eye.. how’s your night going ? 
3676 2018-12-15 23:19:26 Yea u fit add candy join
3677 2018-12-15 23:19:22 $1.5 billion annually worth of imported oil from Saudi Arabia is no small amount
3678 2018-12-15 23:19:22 The docs kept giving my late mother opiates for her uterine cancer and I believe that’s why she died.  I took her off of the pills and replaced them with Cannabis oil, which I believe prolonged her life by a few years.  In the end, docs got her addicted again to opiates
3679 2018-12-15 23:19:18 I think BC’ers just like getting Ripped off. Carbon Tax, ICBC Rates, MSP Employer Fees,Speculation Tax, past Liberals Tax, Weaver wants more Power Tax, let’s fight Oil&Gas Development But take ALL the money from the North that Generates it Tax
3680 2018-12-15 23:19:13 I worked in Kazakhstan in ‘97-‘98 and this is 100% true. Tengiz oil refinery <shudders> and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Never again

3682 2018-12-15 23:19:07 Anyone know of a good book on the basics of #cannabis & the ECS system?

Tons of books about #CBD, hemp oil. Any recommendations please?  TIA 
3683 2018-12-15 23:19:07 I will be able to once industry starts finding and using alternatives. Better leave the oil in the ground than keep killing our biosphere.
3684 2018-12-15 23:19:00 Lol...olive oil n vinegar Democrat. Bahahahaha
3685 2018-12-15 23:18:59 Dude is a full on koch-head libertarian. DDT, asbestos, tobacco, oil, you name it. Also made fun of an environmentalist's death. Just send him to venus so he can breathe all that sweet CO2.
3686 2018-12-15 23:18:45 your neck looks like a oil filter
3687 2018-12-15 23:18:44 You mean Oil Man George Bush? Yup, put wealth ahead of country and planet.

They forgot to mention this at his deification last month.
3688 2018-12-15 23:18:41 I want the candle that melts into massage oil please
3689 2018-12-15 23:18:38 nope. Ive seen it and care...
hope you are squiffy 
3690 2018-12-15 23:18:33 New theme these days in the land of #shale industry is all about bad debt that was fueling the housing bubble is now effectively fueling #shale bubble. The less risky investors become the sooner bubble burst. I see signs of it these days already #OOTT #WTI #Brent $CL_F #OPEC #OIL
3691 2018-12-15 23:18:27 Pity they didn't mention IMO 2020. The sulphur cap on fuel oil.
3692 2018-12-15 23:18:26 But wouldn’t it be great if Canada didn’t have to rely on terrorist regimes for our oil
3693 2018-12-15 23:18:20 You realize the province of Quebec is in top 15 investors of oil sands development right?
3694 2018-12-15 23:18:05 So, China is becoming one of the key global printers of secure currencies. This is not a story. Paying using diamonds is a smart move by Zim if it’s true. What is unlikely is oil payments, Zim has no oil to use as payment form. FakeZone?
3695 2018-12-15 23:17:44 Need some coconut oil for this beard
3696 2018-12-15 23:17:44 I would like to waterboard Jim Inhofe with crude oil instead of water. Does that make me a bad person?
3697 2018-12-15 23:17:30 I believe that the Liberal party in conjunction with this provincial NDP are secretly implementing the Leap Manifesto in regards to Alberta's Oil industry.  What else could explain their actions to this point?
3698 2018-12-15 23:17:19 Be careful, this guy is in w Halliburton and wants to drill for oil in Montana.  They guy is dirty.  My hubby is from Montana.  He is disgusted by his behavior. You can tell he was not born in Montana because he doesn’t value the natural resources he values money
3699 2018-12-15 23:17:16 I also picked up Guess Who and Snake Oil

I know I probably shouldn't buy Snake Oil from anyone, I hear it's bad

3703 2018-12-15 23:17:02 @realDonaldTrump THIS IS YOUR STATE OF WYO CORRUPTION OF GREED OF OIL...AND THE STATE OF WYOMING IS NUMBER ONE IN THE U.S.A FOR CORRUPTION SO STOP KIDNAPPING OUR KIDS FOR A PAY-CHECK....
3704 2018-12-15 23:16:56 You could almost be forgiven for thinking that there is no such thing as a sovereign Syrian state reading his comment. Challenges huh? Like keeping oil & gas supplies from rebuilding entire economy & stopping SAA from decimating reminaing ISIS gangs I imagine.
3705 2018-12-15 23:16:45 I'm from about as far west as one can get. My home hasn't been ravaged in this way, so I can't speak to that experience. But we do rely on tourism, fishing, and logging. I would have more sympathy if Albertans weren't so dismissive about the risks of oil on those industries.
3706 2018-12-15 23:16:38 ............a conspiracy theory and health snake oil publication....bravo

3721 2018-12-15 23:14:07 “Oil & Vinegar Not a Doctor” is very alluring
3722 2018-12-15 23:14:02 Has she tried CBD oil? I don’t know if it is even allowed where you live. I know it helped a lot for my mom when she was going through treatments for cancer.
3723 2018-12-15 23:14:00 Just over 50% of oil in Québec comes from Alberta but way to keep the narrative dishonest. You’re showing excellent leadership here also retweeting a racist caricature of a French Canadian. Bravo. So much to be proud of, Jason
3724 2018-12-15 23:13:42 Thought it would be a good idea to jump out and scare my ma when she was taking the turkey out of the oven. Accidentally poured boiling hot oil all over me. Worst Christmas prank ever
3725 2018-12-15 23:13:37 The oil companies and mining businesses are thanking him profusely.
3726 2018-12-15 23:13:27 You would think there will be a trade in the next few days? Oil can’t go in like his for 6 weeks? Ruuta and bouwmeester? I don’t know how you would get the money to work
3727 2018-12-15 23:13:24 Gerald only gets paid to protest Canadian Ethical and Gay friendly Oil. Gerald gives Saudi and Nigerian oil lots of love. Sad. Traitor to Canada and #LGBTQ ? @FierteCapPride
3728 2018-12-15 23:13:08 Coconut oil or olive oil
3729 2018-12-15 23:13:07 It will only get downhill from here expect a bumpy ride in terms of an unstable global economic reccession plus many backing out of ties with EU and US rn while they settle their issues with trade and inflation over oil It seems Asia is the most peaceful rn despite everything...
3730 2018-12-15 23:12:52 The first two on the list are nations over-reliant on crude oil..coincidence?
3731 2018-12-15 23:12:50 Dig up some oil and make your own
3732 2018-12-15 23:12:45 $1.5 billion annually worth of imported oil from Saudi Arabia is no small amount
3733 2018-12-15 23:12:45 Mouse is doomed. The oil ruined the insulating qualities of its fur and also smells strong. And was released on the porch. If it lives out the day, it will be right back in the house. This was brutal and horrible to watch. Glue traps are pure evil, but this was also tragic
3734 2018-12-15 23:12:39 Petrolia Fire responded in the area of Oil Heritage Rd and Petrolia Line for a reported fire in a field. When crews arrived on scene a flare tip being utilized in an industrial application was what was called in.
No service required. All clear.

3738 2018-12-15 23:12:18 Oil & vinegar. That’s me alright
3739 2018-12-15 23:12:10 Maybe. I was thinking more along the lines of a cheeky Sabre EMP to stun, then a total Eclipse to the heart (by way of two torpedoes). We’ll have that 600i popping like a kernel in hot oil before you know it.

3745 2018-12-15 23:10:52 From more attempts than I care to remember, I can definitely say: no, the garlic does not "liquify in the pan with just a little oil".  It tastes and behaves no different than if you wack it with a big ol' masher, or slice it with a regular knife, or just grate it.
3746 2018-12-15 23:10:41 honestly lots of hair products, ive dyed my hair 4 times including bleaching so lots of deep conditioning, homemade hair masks ALLAT. i personally like to use Shea Butter for hair moisture and i always use Aloe oil.
3747 2018-12-15 23:10:40 Mr. Prime Ministry save the oil investments of the 1%, especially those who are also climate deniers, like Mr. Wilson.
3748 2018-12-15 23:10:38 The ICE is not going away immediately, but in 5-10 years no more passenger cars will be made that burn oil. Competition in the oil sector will become even more fierce than it is already. Albertan oil is high price, low quality and will struggle even more to compete. Sad but true.

3755 2018-12-15 23:09:35 what's certain is that a decent share of the TCJA and the increase in spending caps has flowed to the rest of the world.   drag from nx in q3 significant, and seems likely there will be a further drag in q4.    if net out oil see more clearly.
3756 2018-12-15 23:09:23 Answer my more important question, why isn’t Quebec playing fair with the rest of Canada?  You prefer $$ And oil from the US when helping Alberta gives you more $$ to spend on your social programs.  THAT is the real issue.

3760 2018-12-15 23:09:07 I don’t know what’s wrong with the memory of Trumpers. I’m seeing some say that gas prices were very high under Obama and that under Trump they’re extremely low. They also don’t understand how world oil prices work.

3766 2018-12-15 23:08:31 Perfume oil shops will always be in the itinerary somewhere. They really push you to buy. I dunno where I stashed em but I gave some to ppl. They seem to like ‘em. I don’t wear perfume so much as my is sensitive. I can get a cold from smelling the chemical from perfumes.
3767 2018-12-15 23:08:28 So @ShehuSani realised that camel and transistor radios cannot get him re-elected? He opted for these? Am confident these disabled Nigerians are wise enough and smarter than him, they will collect their share of "constituency allowance" and vote him out to where he rightly belong
3768 2018-12-15 23:08:23 @mcspocky you can also dice up fresh ginger & simmer in coconut-olive oil, 50-50 mix, for a couple hours VERY low heat to create an infusion. Works quite well also, i.e migraine, neck ache & aching typing fingers from too long at the computer screen. Ready in hours.
3769 2018-12-15 23:07:53 Hey @EvanLSolomon next time you do a piece on pipelines, please inquire about the market prospects for Albertan oil. All carmakers have announced plans to stop making internal combustion engines in the next 5-10 years. Competition therefore is going to be fierce.
3770 2018-12-15 23:07:49 I'm amazed at the number of people who still don't believe that our standard of living is dependent on Alberta oil and the workers who produce it. It's pretty simple math. I wonder why? Who do they get their information from? 
#cdnpoli #abpoli #skpoli #qcpoli
3771 2018-12-15 23:07:38 Hahaha, like Forbes is a scientific site. Please. It’s a business journal. Guess which business they were built on? Oil. Guess which industry loses if climate change is recognized? Oil. You’re so easily duped, preacher.

3775 2018-12-15 23:06:46 You don’t mind collecting billions of dollars in equalization from oil and gas / fracking but you choice not to develop your resources.  You could be a have provinces but you choice to collect welfare.
3776 2018-12-15 23:06:36 Alright so @BackroadC turned me on to Monat and I’ve been using their shampoo, aftershave, and beard oil. Since I started using it my hair has thickened up and my beard has softened up. Plus the no burn aftershave is real nice. I highly recommend everyone at least try it
3777 2018-12-15 23:06:34 Oil And Vinegar I'd Rather Not Know -- It's probably snappier in the original Elvish
3778 2018-12-15 23:06:34 At some point just like shale oil, yes.
3779 2018-12-15 23:06:34 The ingredients on Nido say hydrogenated vegatble oil which is terrible for anyone's health. I don't understand this "trust" you are talking about here.
3780 2018-12-15 23:06:30 Wrong. Iran. We are a net exporter of oil. Maybe in the past. Keeping Iran in check is the future. Thanks Obama.
3781 2018-12-15 23:06:29 *pours cbd oil over entire life*
3782 2018-12-15 23:06:27 That's the problem, United's best centre half and can't even get in the England team, treats a football like a hand grenade in a 13 year old's hands, turns like an oil tanker on his right foot, left leg may as well be a giant lollipop stick. He's shit, just so fucking shit.
3783 2018-12-15 23:06:26 I would argue that the volcano lair is farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...... more memorable than an cramped oil rig any day of the week. Visually if nothing else. I'm not saying you're wrong.... but..
3784 2018-12-15 23:06:14 sounds like he's taking more than cbd oil tbh LOL
3785 2018-12-15 23:06:07 Ironically, Ryan was able to get through policy wise in his first budget. In that case it was doofuses on the right who said he gave “Obama everything he wanted.” Ryan negotiated the elimination of the oil export ban which has been huge.

3787 2018-12-15 23:05:51 I take Kratom and CBD Oil to naturally alleviate symptoms daily for these issues.  They clear my mind from the many over thinking thoughts.  Psychedelics also are like the biggest help and like one big therapy session inside yourself.
3788 2018-12-15 23:05:38 So the message is: Fine to come here if you're an oil sheikh or Russian oligarch, but not if you're talented young EU citizen
3789 2018-12-15 23:05:34 They could always use Newfoundland oil. Then no pipeline needed, still Canadian.
3790 2018-12-15 23:05:21 The fact is, car markers are moving into EV but slowly, with a number of considerations dictating the pace.  Consequently, the combustion engine is likely to dominate and be with us for many years. Moreover, petrochemical demand is growing, pulling up oil demand along the way.
3791 2018-12-15 23:05:18 Snake oil in a different bottle.
3792 2018-12-15 23:05:00 Days off are for millionaires and oil tycoons...
3793 2018-12-15 23:05:00 We've still got more Blaze shirts and free oil changes to give away here at Fresno Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram! Here til 4pm for their end of the year sale!!
3794 2018-12-15 23:04:58 do you have any snake oil gummies
3795 2018-12-15 23:04:57 You inspire me! I had never heard of mct oil tho, did a ggl search, does it have a coconut flavor?
3796 2018-12-15 23:04:55 For this administration putting an oil exec in charge of a department created specifically to preserve our national landscape wonders would be apropos.
3797 2018-12-15 23:04:52 Many years I tried to get the "One Day's Oil Revenues" Project off the ground.
The Arab oil-producing countries would donate one day's profit from their oil revenues to get the "refugees" from Palestine resettled.
3798 2018-12-15 23:04:51 Here Mr. Patton, Organic Potato deep fried in rice oil with French pink salt you get at the Trader Joe's
3799 2018-12-15 23:04:43 Texas and the rest of the South will forever try to keep America Neanderthal.  Oil? They can keep it - we have "Lebensraum" in Canada with its vast resources.  There is vast Wind Energy on the upper Atlantic coastline.  Blue America should utter a huge "F U" to Texas and leave.
3800 2018-12-15 23:04:40 Love your account. Great replies lol. I’ll take a more in-depth look at oil free and anything else. I did hear garlic was bad somehow? Don’t care if it technically is. I don’t eat loads of the stuff anyway
3801 2018-12-15 23:04:20 You’ll need fitness balls, some sort of base (I use oil drain pans that cost about $1 each) and drumsticks. And then I recommend checking out @CoachPirillo, @DrumsAlive, and @drumfit  for ideas and inspiration. It is SO MUCH FUN! Both you and your students are going to love it!
3802 2018-12-15 23:04:16 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
3803 2018-12-15 23:04:15 If you aren’t responsible enough to take care of the vehicle that you’re driving (tire rotation, oil change, gas, etc.) should you really be driving?
3804 2018-12-15 23:03:45 Alberta production stopped because of the NEP, not the collapse of world oil prices, a cyclical thing, not the result of government interference in a healthy free market. The liberal government of the day under P.E.T. was responsible for Alberta's malaise.
3805 2018-12-15 23:03:44 Have you been to Eko recently??  They will hardly ever touch you like this and it’s a bigger market space. When there is no law, no crime
3806 2018-12-15 23:03:41 Right.  Like auto insurance.  You don't call your auto insurer when you need to have the oil changed.  Insurance is for catastrophic events.
3807 2018-12-15 23:03:37 Why keep saying that Québec does not buy oil from alberta ?
3808 2018-12-15 23:03:33 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
3809 2018-12-15 23:03:21 Romeo better start burning the midnight oil, his defense has significant deficiencies that Watt alone cannot mask

3812 2018-12-15 23:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
3813 2018-12-15 23:02:28 I get synthetic oil and the synthetic oil filter at the dealership and I still only paid around $70 with a full service check (checking fluids & tire rotation). Seems a bit high girly. 
3814 2018-12-15 23:02:24 Oil and Vinegar Nothing
3815 2018-12-15 23:02:12 STEM majors and dudebros have been talking trash on snake oil for so long but have y'all considered oil from a snake might have aesthetic/calming properties that help ppl who have been ignored by the abusive healthcare system?

DM me for snake oil prices btw

3818 2018-12-15 23:01:49 Trump will fill the the position yet again with a climate denier, who will have worked for the oil or coal industry. They will continue to sell our parks, and their national resources to the highest bidder.
3819 2018-12-15 23:01:39 Trouble dey sleep??? Lol. You must be joking. People’s bodies are touched on a daily basis and trouble dey sleep. Ahh. Education 
3820 2018-12-15 23:01:28 When you start using Coconut Oil 
3821 2018-12-15 23:01:12 But is Wheeler & Bernhardt any different? Bernhardt an oil/gas lobbyist was probably making all the policy decisions anyway while Zinke attempting to make his way up the political food chain. Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist has no concern for environmental protection.
3822 2018-12-15 23:01:06 I thought the issue was oil & supposed US perfidy?
3823 2018-12-15 23:01:02 Oil spilled out My pen almost over
3824 2018-12-15 23:00:56 Especially for oil drilling in sensitive areas, destroying wildlife and just being a POS
3825 2018-12-15 23:00:46 @ Beard Twitter: them beard oil thing does work or is a myth? I’m running out of eucalyptus oil 
3826 2018-12-15 23:00:45 I decree and declare that NO oil will be wasted in 2019! If it isn’t my assignment, it ain’t my business 
#NotWasting1Drop
3827 2018-12-15 23:00:43 Nobody is denying warming-cooling cycles over time, completely independent of humans. Duh.

What’s different is that we’re adding NEW carbon to the system (digging up + burning coal oil gas) & have raised CO2 above 400ppm (from ~285 1850s) for the first time in 3 million years.
3828 2018-12-15 23:00:42 Biodiesel maybe? Running on KFC fryer oil
3829 2018-12-15 23:00:41 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
3830 2018-12-15 23:00:41 I figa you bi into oil and gas oo
3831 2018-12-15 23:00:33 That’s why we need to nationalize the oil industry so these veterans and other deserving workers can keep their jobs - making solar panels and wind turbines and helping to convert the oil and gas infrastructure to support a low carbon economy to avoid climate catastrophe.

3833 2018-12-15 23:00:19 2016 Accord, i bought it new and added a 10 year warranty to it. So far I've only done oil changes and changed the air filter.
3834 2018-12-15 23:00:19 When I saw "Arlington National Cemetery" and "Ryan Zinke" trending I figured he'd shut it down so Big Oil & Gas could drill there.
3835 2018-12-15 23:00:15 Mine would be Oil Vinegar Everything lulz
3836 2018-12-15 23:00:15 Humanity, we got to stop living in the past hoping for a revival in yesteryear industries such as coal mining, oil, gas, etc.  We have to stop doing that.
3837 2018-12-15 22:59:41 The Sudan was a part of Khem; the problems didn't begin until colonization by France and English; colonial powers are still at play due to mineral and oil resources.
3838 2018-12-15 22:59:31 Broccoli is some of the best health value for money in the vegetable kingdom (& goes great, added late, on pizza)!

Refrigerated leftover broccoli also works great as a side dish with lemon & olive oil dressing, or mixed in with tossed salad.

3842 2018-12-15 22:58:53 Yes, everything you describe happened, but the major cause was the collapse in world oil prices. Why pretend Pierre Trudeau could set oil prices?
3843 2018-12-15 22:58:15 brok in to Adamawa and Taraba states. He also build some house in Yola and Kaduna GRA's and rented them. Not to even mentioned his business with late Shehu Musa Yar adua (NICOTES) and a certain Italian man Delhi for oil and Gas business in Lagos.

3847 2018-12-15 22:57:55 So I just took a 2hr nap bc it was raining too hard to try another oil change and I was avoiding unpacking my college stuff. And I can guarantee I’ll still go to bed at 10 and wake up at 8:00 tomorrow. Why am I the way that I am?
3848 2018-12-15 22:57:43 Dear Santa, 
For Christmas I would like an oil change, tire rotation, new break pads, new wiper blades and washer fluid, a car wash, detail, and a full tank of gas. 
I'll leave my keys next to your cookies. You're the best. 
Merry Christmas, Elise
3849 2018-12-15 22:57:39 ........but coconut oil..... mmmmmm
3850 2018-12-15 22:57:31 For the record, there is no "all Republican" state, school, restaurant or oil well. Let em golf and go to Maralargo where members get robbed by the head liar in charge.
3851 2018-12-15 22:57:30 By all means please install the puppets son shah jr. We would love to start stealing your oil again!
3852 2018-12-15 22:57:23 Oh yes Moroccan oil products are great!
3853 2018-12-15 22:57:00 We gave the shah refugee status after he was overthrown. The Saudi’s who did submit to the west like the shah, created OPEC to try and control the other non puppet controlled oil nations. It’s a farce. We’ve already declassified everything. We installed the Shah and armed him.
3854 2018-12-15 22:56:56 Obv theres some olive oil in there too
3855 2018-12-15 22:56:50 Yes the oil lobby are part of the can of worms.  I watched a very interesting report on the food industry,in particular the meat industry,who are huge producers of pollution,gobbling up resources to feed the wealthy countries.
3856 2018-12-15 22:56:49 So. Titan Publishing is now into oil. Sure. #Days
3857 2018-12-15 22:56:22 Sorry to but in but Moroccan Oil Curl Cream is really good for defining curls.30e for a large bottle that lasts me around 6 months

3859 2018-12-15 22:56:06 All of Canada has terrible challenges with the treatment of first nations women. Cherry pick the oil industry is self serving
3860 2018-12-15 22:55:50 Also, until a few years ago, they ran the oil markets
3861 2018-12-15 22:55:45 Which climate change predictions and peak oil predictions from the 1970s have come true?
#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
3862 2018-12-15 22:55:45 Unless they make reference to the production cuts that Russia plans together with OPEC, contributing to the oil price growth, the @culpaderusia narrative is total Bullshit.
3863 2018-12-15 22:55:37 daz wat u call oil, child
3864 2018-12-15 22:55:34 ..... "I'm not oil for this world."
3865 2018-12-15 22:55:23 I just don’t like baby lotions or soaps cause they put more shit uh there than it needs to be. I’d stick with the coconut oil if you do choose to put anything on his skin, if you put any on his face just use a very very very little bit cause you can clog his pores

3871 2018-12-15 22:54:04 Daigo, ZJZ, Oil King, Pikoro, Big Bird, CJ Truth, and 2 others could go 0-2, including Haitani, Nemo and Luffy
3872 2018-12-15 22:53:58 Okay so u had multiple lesbian experiences, homemade thong underwear, a little bit of pencil play, finger bang train, oil on the ass & bloody tent sex?? lol 
3873 2018-12-15 22:53:42 Wow. I temember when Venezuela was a big source for oil here, guess no longer the case. Meanwhile we have bumper to bumper traffic from 450 suburbs into M guzzling oil & yet they call it dirty - hypocrites!
3874 2018-12-15 22:53:41 So you’re personally going to benefit from the UCP regime. That’s clearly what you are inferring in statements promoting Kenney as the saviour. Let me guess, your husband’s company will directly benefit from unfettered oil production & flat personal & corporate taxes.
3875 2018-12-15 22:53:23 Y’all should really try oil pulling
3876 2018-12-15 22:53:23 Clocking out. Lol finna go get my oil changed
3877 2018-12-15 22:53:13 Well, at least it shouldn't poison you, so that's an improvement for the snake oil medicine market
3878 2018-12-15 22:53:08 This is an #AmericaFirst issue. We grew up using oils from American crops in peanut butter, mac & cheese, etc, etc. Farmers should demand we stop importing palm oil.
3879 2018-12-15 22:52:36 腰痛と恋愛はいやや
3880 2018-12-15 22:52:01 Need to get the oil to the coast to receive fair market value. According to premier notley losing 80 million a day just  on the oil differential is quite a bit of money according to my calculations. Not much of an economy  for the rest of socialist Canada.
3881 2018-12-15 22:51:59 Emission targets, carbon taxes, elimination of oil & gas, etc..... global warming has got to be the biggest scam in human history. Humans can't protect Mother Earth from natural events & cycles by paying more & more. Total con job.
Believers continue to fly/drive/heat/etc. - Why?
3882 2018-12-15 22:51:55 I draw d rope...d Engine no start...ionno weda to change d plug or na Engine oil

3885 2018-12-15 22:51:46 I’m sure he’ll be an oil man, or a coal mine owner, or an endangered species poacher.  Only the best right?

3888 2018-12-15 22:51:22 What’s that midnight oil lyric? Short memory I’ve got a short memory.......
3889 2018-12-15 22:51:15 B confused the oil indicator on her car (which is a clock telling her how long she has until she needs to get it changed) with "something that looks like it's a quarter dark, and 3/4ths lit up"

*sighs* they're like the hands of a clock. Man oh man.

3892 2018-12-15 22:50:55 I found all my art supplies and after getting 95% through an art project I learned I hate oil pastels
3893 2018-12-15 22:50:49 I want them to sell to that Arab guy! Oil money would do us wonders, I believe with the right management, we would be on top again!
3894 2018-12-15 22:50:48 I had already done this: it’s Dr Hauschka lemon bath oil. (Besides the less-tangible gift of sanity, I mean.)
3895 2018-12-15 22:50:41 I told my dad I needed my oil changed again and he got mad lmaooo
3896 2018-12-15 22:50:38 How have I changed the subject  the incompetence of city fans is unbearable. If it wasn’t for oil money you wouldn’t even be in this conversation, you’ll be waving your blue flag around London supporting Chelsea. Have fun playing catch up though, we’re waiting.
3897 2018-12-15 22:50:32 PICTURE THEM CLARICE PICTURE THE OIL PAINTINGS
3898 2018-12-15 22:50:21 Coconut oil is one of the best oils to use. My mom makes homemade skintherapy products so i just use the “Baby Balm” she makes but it’s just cocoa butter, mango butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, and some other natural ingredients we just don’t put it on her face.
3899 2018-12-15 22:50:16 Probably not, he has surrounded himself with yes men and women who are afraid to question him.  I agree the middle east oil politics is massively influential but it is the west that created that cauldron and continues to meddle.
3900 2018-12-15 22:50:03 cannabis oil for sleep and general balancing
3901 2018-12-15 22:49:59 OMG! Just shut up already. You wonder why we hate you. You’re trying to take us back to the Stone Age! You are actively trying to destroy America, it’s water, air, lands, and people. Show your old school oil and coal cronies the door and focus on sustainable energy!
3902 2018-12-15 22:49:28 Just PS4 wearing a bit. Unlike oil on a car, you can’t redo you heat sink every 5000 hours of gaming. And it’s a bit the fan
3903 2018-12-15 22:49:28 It’s clear we have a really big problem, it sucks, & fixing isn’t going to be easy. Do all these other countries pollute our water to get their oil? How much is a desalination plant? What about a pipeline to get water to sands and fracking? Cut costs with trans, I don’t care.
3904 2018-12-15 22:49:22 When you want to cook something really hot peanut oil is an excellent choice. It is general less prone to thermal decomposition and bursting into flames at really high temperatures when compared to the other oils.
3905 2018-12-15 22:49:14 Economy !!! U r talking rubbish what is the current GDP ?  And what was it before NaMo. Question n counter question goes for LPG , Crude oil, and other daily consumer goods used by common man. 
Please explain ! My next Vote is for NaMo that too in orange color.
3906 2018-12-15 22:49:13 Seriously!! If you can’t afford your Greek olive oil and whatnot, don’t get it??? It’s not that hard.
3907 2018-12-15 22:49:11 This peppermint oil opens up your nose faster than Vicks. Literally wakens up whole system.

3910 2018-12-15 22:48:59 Baby oil and hot water make a handy weapon if you’re ever in a jam.
3911 2018-12-15 22:48:53 This has made this Montanan very giddy. He ran on keeping public lands public and not selling them off. He’s just like the rest of Montana Republicans, just waiting to sell off every piece of land, state/U.S. parklands they can to mining companies and big oil. He’s despicable.
3912 2018-12-15 22:48:51 You should. Unfortunately they don't teach you history from around the world. You see, the computer or watch you wear doesn't work without the coltan from Congo. You car doesn't run without oil from overseas, your clothes and food? Coming from abroad. Yet these people are bad.
3913 2018-12-15 22:48:49 One time, I was putting on body oil and Joey Ryan DM’d me...
3914 2018-12-15 22:48:47 Very nice car. Looks new. Completely professionally detailed new wipers brakes and tires are like new. Oil just changed. One owner carfax available. Runs and drives great and everything works. Automatic.  $5000
3915 2018-12-15 22:48:36 Please use oil or lotion, or pure corn starch if you must have powder.
3916 2018-12-15 22:48:35 What a Racket, she’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Has worked for years to stop pipelines and slow oil and gas development which ironically she got through cutting production. Now she’s pro-energy because her jobs on the line. Pathetic. Nice royalty review BTW
3917 2018-12-15 22:48:31 I prefer the rus 100,000 Gallon Oil Tanks in the Background.
3918 2018-12-15 22:48:28 The currency will be oil, preferably bitumen in easy to carry zip-loc bags.
3919 2018-12-15 22:48:27 Does Smith have oil on his hands? Why can’t he squeeze the ball? #iubb
3920 2018-12-15 22:48:12 Interesting is in the eye of the beholder. Is the graph "energy" in metric tons oil equivalent, or "cost"?
3921 2018-12-15 22:48:04 My bf and I just had a legitimate fight over canola oil popcorn vs butter popcorn. 

It's okay @BlairRhys. Youre allowed to be wrong.
3922 2018-12-15 22:48:01 coconut oil? what would suggest?
3923 2018-12-15 22:47:31 We don’t challenge anyone or give in to anyone. (Saudi Arabia first) That's all. Saudi Arabia's oil policy is fixed, which is to obtain a price that does not harm the global economy and does not harm its economy. Accordingly, production is raised or reduced.
3924 2018-12-15 22:47:21 I agree. No sense in arguing with someone who doesn't realize the donations were from individuals who work in the oil industry.
3925 2018-12-15 22:47:19 Let me just put it out there, diversification of the Nigerian economy from oil will always be just a long sentence till Nigeria fixes Power. There will be no real diversification without huge increase in manufacturing and no huge increase in manufacturing without steady power
3926 2018-12-15 22:47:19 But you definitely don’t wanna put oil on his face
3927 2018-12-15 22:46:56 Putting coconut oil sur mes cheveux semble être une idée très mauvaise. Plus d’info demain
3928 2018-12-15 22:46:51 Right now im watching my dad change the oil of my car & I can't help but appreciate this man.
3929 2018-12-15 22:46:46 De olho nos royalties estes governadores farão de tudo para jorrar oil&gas em seus estados.
3930 2018-12-15 22:46:42 Oil king lost bc he ain’t talk to his girl all week lol
3931 2018-12-15 22:46:40 oil king, zjz 0-2 squad
3932 2018-12-15 22:46:39 @NuLeafNaturals CBD is the purest on the market and has 2.4mg #Cannabidiol per drop. Measure by percentage is not an accurate way to estimate THC. Full Spectrum Hemp derived cbd oil should be less than .3% Trace amounts may not be detectable.
3933 2018-12-15 22:46:36 Lmao I'm still thinking about that oil canvas painting someone did of it 
3934 2018-12-15 22:46:35 You might as well try to compare the taste of motor oil and camel piss. There is no similarity other than the nation of origin.
3935 2018-12-15 22:46:34 Butchering Saudi Sheiks would have to be molesting children in streets of Ottawa & Montreal before Trudeau would promote a East Oil pipeline. Butts has no moral compass. Saudi’s have the same opinion of women as Ecole Poly Technique killer & it’s OK Liberals-Now a Eastern Party
3936 2018-12-15 22:46:33 Could have been a Chanukah miracle. That miraculous oil was undoubtedly cooking oil.
3937 2018-12-15 22:46:31 Cbd oil does have lots of potential benefits in the right scenarios.

Though Ghee or Tumeric in coffee isn't something I'd have ever given a thought about. Cinnamon though, that I can understand.
3938 2018-12-15 22:46:28 When frank ocean said never trust a pre roll on endless I ain’t rly feel that cuz the convenience of a pre roll is chill some are shitty word but some of them are gas with the infused paper and oil and keef and shit
3939 2018-12-15 22:46:27 Such dickheads. How could they survive without oil & USA protection.
3940 2018-12-15 22:46:23 I need oil king and Magi to do well
3941 2018-12-15 22:46:23 Will probably be cooked with palm oil
3942 2018-12-15 22:46:21 That was the hey days of Scotland's oil boom. You know the one that was kept secret from Scotland by consecutive Labour and Tory Governments? Why do Tories lie so easily, or are you just so f&ckin stupid that you can't see the wood for the trees?
3943 2018-12-15 22:46:15 Getting my oil changed and for no reason just got the hokey pokey song stuck in my head. WTF is wrong with me?
3944 2018-12-15 22:46:14 agreed, but the oil lobby wins until you kill them off. I'm for killing them off before they kill everyone else.
3945 2018-12-15 22:46:13 Oil King acabou de caiu. Que dó. 
3946 2018-12-15 22:46:12 Bro I'm so sad for oil king ..
3947 2018-12-15 22:46:09 As you type your tweet on an object created by oil. #hyprocrite   Live for a day without oil or a bi-product of oil. Bet you can’t!
3948 2018-12-15 22:46:08 4/n. Oil price was skewed lower by KSA overproduction to compensate gor Iran sanctions, then DJT gave 1.3M in waivers. Then oil skewed by MSB trying to pls DJT re: Kashoki. Now, China said to resume US imports & Canada cut. Spare capacity is low.  KSA needs $70 wti 4 its budget.
3949 2018-12-15 22:45:46 It's like the highest court in the country approving the purchase of a proposed oil  pipeline, to have the same court later disapprove of it.
3950 2018-12-15 22:45:43 i try not to laugh every time the guy shows me what my oil looks like BC IDK WHAT IM LOOKING AT LMAO
3951 2018-12-15 22:45:29 Well.....I need an Italian BMT with everything except jalapeños...mayo, mustard, oil, and vinegar. WITH a lemonade and a splash of Powerade 
3952 2018-12-15 22:45:27 Cut in half. Cover in oil, roast and serve with a boner.
3953 2018-12-15 22:45:19 You just need to exersize and Take the thc oil and you’ll be good
3954 2018-12-15 22:45:15 Tea Tree oil will FOREVER be my bestfriend.
3955 2018-12-15 22:45:09 あーはいはいはい
3956 2018-12-15 22:44:39 I’ve ate 2 CBD oil gummy bears. I may be a little high here at work. It may just be my imagination since I’ve never done them before though. #onthedope
3957 2018-12-15 22:44:27 give me beard oil as Christmas gift.. 
3958 2018-12-15 22:44:26 So I decided to wear mascara everyday all day this week and my lashes have lessen a little bit and I'm sad but Im happy I have coconut and castor oil :)
3959 2018-12-15 22:44:26 Sympathies, have you tried the Hairball bikkies?  If constipation is a problem some olive oil on the plate (tsp)can help. I have a very fluffy, sheddy & fussy puss who hates being groomed.  He eats a lot of tuna and manages well for the most part.
3960 2018-12-15 22:44:23 ごめんごめんw
3961 2018-12-15 22:44:22 AMEN!! And Tiger Nation still has the BEST COACHES and STAFF in the COUNTRY!! What a difference a year is gonna make!! Penny can OUT Recruit “the snake oil salesman” in Kensucky
3962 2018-12-15 22:43:51 Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe
Can he be more cleaner
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up.....
3963 2018-12-15 22:43:45 Du!!!!!!!!!!  That hurt to see Oil King’s reaction to his loss 
3964 2018-12-15 22:43:30 Yah you can adjust this to hit dabs, oil, hashish,  whatever but I find setting 5 out of 7 perfect for flowers. Makes the throat tickle just enough..
3965 2018-12-15 22:43:12 Nooo oil :(((
3966 2018-12-15 22:43:04 “FOLKS, GET EXCITED...COMING TO THE STAGE NEXT AT CLUB TOOLZ...Oil and Vinegar Temperament”
3967 2018-12-15 22:43:01 know u weren’t asking me but yes. you just have to be extra careful about removing it. only oil free makeup wipes and even then, be careful about not touching the eyelash extensions themselves. there’s special eyelash wash too!
3968 2018-12-15 22:42:54 Let’s go for the Norway model. I.e., suddenly discover huge oil reserves that we can all benefit from. #Brexit
3969 2018-12-15 22:42:50 I hate paying places to do my oil change 
3970 2018-12-15 22:42:50 Fun #dragon fact: Dragons naturally create a highly flammable oil, which is stored in their throats. When they breathe fire, they spit out the oil, and their rough teeth create a spark to light the oil, giving an illusion of breathing fire.

Gotta admit, I miss seeing dragons.
3971 2018-12-15 22:42:50 Oil King out, Adel out. Nooooooo 
3972 2018-12-15 22:42:49 Sad for Oil King. Always want him to win.
3973 2018-12-15 22:42:32 Oil King 
3974 2018-12-15 22:42:30 My toes are ready to be sucked. Matching mani/pedi got me feeling brand new along with this oil treatment I got on, tuh! 
3975 2018-12-15 22:42:16 the Almond Nail & Cuticle Oil #fillyourstockings #enchantedbynature!
3976 2018-12-15 22:42:15 I'd say it depends on what you'll replace it with. Switching to more fresh veggies, whole grains etc are good for both your and environmental health. If you're swapping out a processed food with palm oil to one made with other oils it gets complicated but could be a net negative.
3977 2018-12-15 22:42:13 Awww Oil King, so much passion
3978 2018-12-15 22:42:07 Er, 'despite an "oil glut"'?

I don't think you can have too much oil, it is just more raw wealth for America, and can be exported.
3979 2018-12-15 22:42:06 Yes, as long as you keep them clean. Make sure to use an oil free cleanser to remove your eyeshadow, as oil breaks the glue down and can effect your retention :)
3980 2018-12-15 22:42:02 Oil King se va 0 a 2, por eso nadie se toma la foto con él
3981 2018-12-15 22:41:37 When it comes to Oscar, always expect the worst.
3982 2018-12-15 22:41:24 AHH. Got me breaking out some oil and frying me some chicken this thread. Damn
3983 2018-12-15 22:41:16 Dietary restrictions like not being able to have oil or salt on the fries?
3984 2018-12-15 22:41:15 So people get harassed everyday but you want them to be nice when they are protesting and saying “don’t touch us “?? . Dkm pls
3985 2018-12-15 22:41:04 That’s fucked...CBD oil really helps my friend not have to take anxiety medication
3986 2018-12-15 22:40:32 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you

3989 2018-12-15 22:40:17 A barrel of uncut, 100% pure Canadian maple syrup is worth more than a barrel of crude oil
3990 2018-12-15 22:40:14 If Americans are willing to give up their freedom and patriotism to a 'snake oil salesman' then what sympathy should they expect from the rest of the world?
3991 2018-12-15 22:40:09 If you have olive oil you can substitute it
3992 2018-12-15 22:40:06 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
3993 2018-12-15 22:39:58 i now talk about the options before they start. and give them the pro's and cons of each w/b, hybrid and oil there choice then with my advice.

3997 2018-12-15 22:39:37 My stepdad goes “the oil in my truck has more miles on it than your whole car”
3998 2018-12-15 22:39:36 Yeah man... Rub cast iron w oil and hang that up. Dishwasher Detergent will destroy the patina.
3999 2018-12-15 22:39:27 Holy crap that air fryer is gonna change my salmon ways. So delicious, and not a drop of oil.
4000 2018-12-15 22:39:23 Who owns Trump:
Russia
Insurance Companies
The Middle Eastern Hierarchies 
The coal industry
The Oil industry
Everyone he’s doing favors for w/o thought to the harm to US citizens and the environment.
Someone else has more,I imagine.
4001 2018-12-15 22:39:03 Oil and Gas production, straight out of the ground!
4002 2018-12-15 22:38:38 Madam prease I bling hen and palm oil for u today.. But your mother say u not home. Prease let me know when you come back because my broda Kweku wants to kill the hen so I bling u again
4003 2018-12-15 22:38:13 Then. Once again, big ups to them. 
4004 2018-12-15 22:38:08 When your really high and spill a gram of oil all over the bed and @fightmystepdad is just drunk enough to pick it up for you 
4005 2018-12-15 22:38:02 Nothing more frustrating than waiting outside Great Canadian Oil Change in East #Regina for 15 minutes, the only car waiting for next available station, to have someone come out and say they are closing more than 1.5 hours early for a party. Flat out disappointing.
4006 2018-12-15 22:38:02 Wessonality!  That's when you taste the ass and not the oil.
4007 2018-12-15 22:38:00 And how many millions of dollars did the oil industry invest in trying to bring forward a project and how many man hours of work were tied up in that
4008 2018-12-15 22:37:47 WE have seen sinkholes created by natural gas and oil extraction.  WE are seeing our forest dying at fast rates. WE have to rebuild our planet, There is NO safe extraction and messing with the inner mechanics of earth.
4009 2018-12-15 22:37:32 Please don't bother arguing with this one. He's clearly not well. Those women, big ups to them for speaking out. Knew such existed but boy oh boy, those mofuckers are crazy!!! The videos got me really pissed. I'd like to join the next one, I pray I'm in Lagos

4013 2018-12-15 22:37:02 The enemy is Climate Change. Their ally is the Fossil Fuel Industry. We need to guard against their operatives in the GOP and Democratic Party (Beto caught with oil money).

4016 2018-12-15 22:36:28 Just as bad is the disposable waste oil companies dump back in the ground. Texas has a law that prevents doctors from telling patients if they’re being poisoned by that waste. I don’t even drink the water in Oklahoma.  I know there is something wrong with it.

4019 2018-12-15 22:36:00 Not sure I get it re: Norway.  Norway produces a large quantity of oil & gas.  Most of it is exported, earning cash or foreign exchange for Norway, which I assume is very profitable.  What is the purpose of the subsidy?  Do the production companies get the subsidy.
4020 2018-12-15 22:35:48 What’s the best brand for Beard Oil?

4022 2018-12-15 22:35:32 Is this account @LilleyPeter for notorious #Brexit snake oil salesman, and “WTO PLUS PLUS PLUS” deal advocate, legit? #ProfessionalBullshitter 
4023 2018-12-15 22:35:32 No.    Alberta keeps taking our tax dollars to subsidize foreign-owned oil corporations, and Canadians have had enough of the free ride.
4024 2018-12-15 22:35:17 CBD oil helps me sleep. It helps with nerve pain/restless legs/ anxiety.
4025 2018-12-15 22:35:05 Mine looks different to yours and idk might have been a one off but all I could taste was olive oil
4026 2018-12-15 22:34:55 All green veg pretty much contains Vitamin K1 which is the antidote to a warfarin overdose.
Also, avocados, olive oil and some other things listed in the big booklet.
Alcohol - you either need to drink the same amount each day/week, and NOT binge on a weekend 
4027 2018-12-15 22:34:43 Jason is flogging snake oil.
4028 2018-12-15 22:34:34 Plenty firms Dey do awards dinner then things,massa we dey go chase high grade high else rice den oil saf we no go get
4029 2018-12-15 22:34:28 Pom juice is from a plant but not a whole plant. Multiple studies show artery benefits to unsweetened Pom.  Coconut oil is not a whole plant that precipitates a massive metabolic endotoxemia
4030 2018-12-15 22:34:22 about 2 months behind on getting an oil change yay me
4031 2018-12-15 22:34:20 Not to mention that Tar sands oil is garbage when compared to middle eastern crude.
4032 2018-12-15 22:34:04 That wouldn’t resolve the pipeline issue, and I get why people are frustrated about that. But it’s also not the country against Alberta here. Harper couldn’t get a pipeline built in 10 years. And the oil industry is a rough basket to put all your eggs into.
4033 2018-12-15 22:34:03 Per what I read, British MI6 asked CIA to overthrow Mosaddegh, due mainly to oil, of course. Dingbat CIA said OK. Local CIA dudes in Iran didn't think it would work, but gave it a try--it failed. So MI6 said "Never mind, then." But CIA locals gave it another try & succeeded.
4034 2018-12-15 22:33:55 My car is getting it's oil changed right now, and the guy calls to ask if I wanted them to change my headlight that is out and sounded like, genuinely surprised when I said I could handle it lmaooo
4035 2018-12-15 22:33:45 Foreign oil is being purchased only because it’s not available locally. The Liberals do not want Alberta Oil making it imposible to pipeline to tide water. Alberta oil means prosperity for the West. A Trudeau will never allow that again. Breaking news!
4036 2018-12-15 22:33:43 And they survived long enough thanks to a greater anti-fascist sending them food oil and weapons. The U.S.A capitalism made it possible to defeat the nazis. Dont forget the U.S. part.
4037 2018-12-15 22:33:32 I swear by oil of oregano pills too..been taking them for 3 years and 3 years no colds..I drive truck and am in a ton of different environments..
4038 2018-12-15 22:33:32 They are an embassment should remember the good old days of relegation battles before the oil money came in
4039 2018-12-15 22:33:23 It goes back 800,000+ years, but nothing changed out of the natural CO2 cycle until the 1800’s, when we started digging up fossil carbon (coal oil gas) and burning it, adding new CO2 to the system, and raising CO2 from ~285ppm to 412ppm and rising. 

That’s why.
4040 2018-12-15 22:33:10 I have a vape. It’s full of cannabis oil
4041 2018-12-15 22:33:03 gas and oil is death and the lies and blackmail and the stupidity of making plants illegal to create this sickness of using herbs to harass and imprison people and invade privacy saying oh know they have a plant/ is all part of this insanity. WE all should have free or low cost
4042 2018-12-15 22:32:54 Strange how all the multi millionaire public servants love Saudi Oil
4043 2018-12-15 22:32:53 Gerry, I think you’re missing the point.  Western provinces are already feeling alienated by Ottawa and Quebec.  When the Quebec Premiere says no-to more Alberta oil, yet imports oil from other non-Canadian sources, it increases the alienation.  Biting the hand that feeds them.
4044 2018-12-15 22:32:44 Oil & Vinegar Vape
4045 2018-12-15 22:32:44 Guilty, your just another corrupt Trump crony crawling away to jet a job with big oil/ gas or lobbying. Wallowing in the swamp
4046 2018-12-15 22:32:41 How then can APC say they inherited a bad government, when they are now returning to footprints of the immediate past government? Fuel price increased, yet subsidy continued when the global oil market price dwindled. Shocking for me!
4047 2018-12-15 22:32:24 As long as oil moons, we will do great in transportation
4048 2018-12-15 22:32:19 I just googled how to decrease body heat and got tender coconut water, pomegranate juice, almond oil, sandalwood, loose linen clothing, and the sitali yoga breath. You’ll get more laughter envisioning Milloy doomed by his own beliefs to become late-stage John Lennon
4049 2018-12-15 22:31:56 Really?. He believes  that cancer is  caused  by ' negative Really?. Honestly...
Snake oil..
4050 2018-12-15 22:31:43 I just don't know why the FDA did not put Obama out of business his 1st year of selling his snake oil. But they let him walk away with more $$ than he would have earned as a community organizing protester
4051 2018-12-15 22:31:42 We've got free oil changes to give away every 30 mins! Here at Fresno Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram on Blackstone for their huge end of the year savings!
4052 2018-12-15 22:31:16 If I only shorted oil in October and collected a month later 
4053 2018-12-15 22:31:06 but the trump cult love pollution its their constitutional right to be poisoned .... 

they need those oligarchs and murderous arab leaders to get richer so they err .. 

hang on a minute why do they support oil companies???
4054 2018-12-15 22:31:04 Right now, my focus seems to be covered in oil. I may catch it, but in a moment it slips out of my grasp.  #writingcommunity #amwriting #writerproblems #writerslife #wip
4055 2018-12-15 22:31:00 Big oil is fighting against solar roadways tooth and nail because guess where asphalt comes from?  Oil.  If we replaced our roads with solar roadways, big oil loses a big chunk of their revenue.
4056 2018-12-15 22:30:59 Thats OK Texas will be a waste land before oil reserves run out so who cares about Texas. I say that having been born there!
4057 2018-12-15 22:30:58 Called - said they use vegetable oil and butter. 
4058 2018-12-15 22:30:55 Of course they do.  But they are by far the lesser of the evils.  

How many birds and other wildlife have died from oil spills?  Idjit!
4059 2018-12-15 22:30:27 This nigga @44Spinner spit coconut oil all over his TV after laughin to hard. Ewwwwww
4060 2018-12-15 22:30:23 “EVOO, Extra Virgin Olive Oil”....  every damn time. Completely obviating the purpose of an acronym.
4061 2018-12-15 22:30:05 I use olive oil all of the time
4062 2018-12-15 22:29:49 Please don't pretend they don't also control some Democrats.... Natural Gas loves to donate to Dems...oil and nat gas have same owners!
4063 2018-12-15 22:29:49 Can’t you see your club is going down, you can’t even keep up with spurs lol soon you’ll discover oil 
4064 2018-12-15 22:29:49 it’ll change your life. castor oil > everything
4065 2018-12-15 22:29:43 It’s extremely dim and simplistic. Which not surprisingly is your typical Kennochio supporter. Btw, did you put that Oil in the ground?
4066 2018-12-15 22:29:35 Then stop taking money that is coming predominatly from provinces where the main industry is oil/gas production. Quebec wants it both ways. I can guarantee you that if the oil was coming from Que, there would be pipelines to every part of this country.
4067 2018-12-15 22:29:24 They cannot dictate how and where a private company buys its oil

4070 2018-12-15 22:29:23 I don't really cook very often.  The people I live with use olive oil sometimes.
4071 2018-12-15 22:29:17 If your driving down Hammersmith bridge and towards Westfield’s Shepperd bush - please be aware there’s some kind of oil spillage on the road which has made a couple of cars skid and lose grip on their car. I’ve just had a small bump In to the back of my car for the same reason
4072 2018-12-15 22:29:16 Vinegar and oil living overseas?
4073 2018-12-15 22:29:04 Is it olive oil or beef dripping in his hair
4074 2018-12-15 22:29:04 I guess I sent an incomplete thought. Carpet bomb the entire country and then go in and take whatever resources survived. Last I checked we can still drill for oil through glass
4075 2018-12-15 22:29:03 Never has an industry (oil and gas) with a pet government of four decades’ duration so successfully convinced people that it is patriotic rather than profit-seeking for shareholders and executives.
4076 2018-12-15 22:28:55 So jfaf causes pain ur ass, u can always use looo or vasline, try baby oil perhaps
4077 2018-12-15 22:28:55 Exactly... I can make that at home with pouring hot oil on some some raw chicken
4078 2018-12-15 22:28:49 Simple. The Oil Companies are ripping us off but the Govt. won’t do anything because they make lots of tax dollars. Very sad.
4079 2018-12-15 22:28:47 Before canada we do oil changes ourselves. Now the condo won't let me jack up cars and do oil changes. Something about regulations.. Pffft..
4080 2018-12-15 22:28:43 ...why? They understand the economic benefit to lead and not follow. Natural gas is the future over coal. Countries and groups who fight this will suffer. Oil field companies invested into natural gas liquidification processes for this reason.
4081 2018-12-15 22:28:41 N.B., Having said that...these are very POTENT essential oils that should be diluted in a "Carrier Oil" either PO or cutaneous/topical application.

We concur w/@AustinNoel18 that Young LIVING Eos .@younglivingeo offers consistently TOP GRADE [Rx Quality] essential oils & blends.
4082 2018-12-15 22:28:33 Insofar as it has oil and a bit of financial services?
4083 2018-12-15 22:28:10 Jalapeño kettle cooked chips  oil rn
4084 2018-12-15 22:28:08 I may be depressed, suicidal, and not doing the job i love. But i always feel better knowing im not that girl from high school who is now caught up in a pyramid scheme selling CBD oil on instagram.
4085 2018-12-15 22:28:08 Hoping he skips go and goes to h***. For pushing for elephant trophies, his recommendations for national parks & landmarks & drilling for oil.  
4086 2018-12-15 22:27:46 Many older people though I think are afraid of changing times and nostalgic by nature of “the good old days” -trump (one of histories best con-artists/snake oil salesman ) sold this ideal with MAGA-anyone honest(like you) realizes most things were worse in the “good old days”
4087 2018-12-15 22:27:45 When I used to work in construction, with many illegal aliens, finding where they crap in attics, closets, basically anywhere they can, could this be related to this?
4088 2018-12-15 22:27:38 Olive oil trump voters ?????
4089 2018-12-15 22:27:31 It’s clear we have a really big problem, it sucks, & fixing isn’t going to be easy. Do all these other countries pollute our water to get their oil? How much is a desalination plant? What about a pipe line to get water to sands and fracking? Cut costs with trans, I don’t care
4090 2018-12-15 22:27:08 Vinegar and oil no kids
4091 2018-12-15 22:27:02 Olive Oil with Sea Salt Needs to Get Out More
4092 2018-12-15 22:26:59 Canada for example is obliged to sell 75% of its oil to the USA via its Free Trade agreement.  That's a huge loss of sovereignty - but it's what happens when you deal with bigger nations. So England - as a middle power - is going to lose sovereignty whatever road it takes.
4093 2018-12-15 22:26:53 So, you're saying oil companies should be drilling on Venus, because it's not like they could fuck up that planet?
4094 2018-12-15 22:26:40 It can only be cooking oil.
4095 2018-12-15 22:26:37 Hi Erni. Why do you think they don’t bring sufficient oil?
4096 2018-12-15 22:26:32 I am baptising tomorrow afternoon. I love rural ministry. Remember to bring the service sheets, candle, oil, certificate and the water. #Edrychymlaen
4097 2018-12-15 22:26:08 I wonder why this amazing American success story isn’t embraced by business president Trump or business party GOP? Fox News?  Oh yeah, they all belong to big oil.
4098 2018-12-15 22:26:03 Exactly bruv!
Oil dey ur head jhare
4099 2018-12-15 22:25:40 The irony is once the natural gas and the oil is gone, the trees will be burned by the survivors for heat.
4100 2018-12-15 22:25:39 I've got one already ...

'Dierdre, what's for dinner'?
'An oil and grease.'

'See, I told you.'
4101 2018-12-15 22:25:32 I think we are in backward time where conservatives want to give grants to oil and car companies but don’t want to give grants to money saving medical practices like midwives - I thought you guys liked free markets?
4102 2018-12-15 22:25:17 @SecretaryZinke was an exploitive, plutocratic catering tool of the oil & gas industry. A disgraced Navy Seal and soon to be indicted member of the most criminal admin in America's history. #Montana needs to take a close look at why you say otherwise. #fecklessGop #environment
4103 2018-12-15 22:25:09 Toss cut potatoes in olive oil and put them in the air fryer for a few minutes. I used the air crisp function on my Ninja Foodi.

4104 2018-12-15 22:24:53 Why don’t they use Newfoundland oil?
4105 2018-12-15 22:24:51 자동트윗 어떻게만드는거
4106 2018-12-15 22:24:46 Keep in mind this discussion only pertains to sources of energy. It does not take into account the fact that oil is pervasive to every part of modern society. Our homes, places of work, clothes, food qnd electronic devices are all dependant on oil or oil based products.
4107 2018-12-15 22:24:41 We all thought he resigned because he was more concerned about coal and oil than citizens future water and environment needs
4108 2018-12-15 22:24:37 Like who get smashed two days in row? Like girl where’s my half of the oil money? 
4109 2018-12-15 22:24:37 Olive oil everything.
4110 2018-12-15 22:24:32 Wouldn’t matter. He’d look at that vista and cry because he didn’t see any beautiful oil wells or open-pit mines.
4111 2018-12-15 22:24:23 A lot of energy is from imported oil.
The easy way to figure out contributions to society is to look at total income.
The income from rural America is low and going down. The income from urban areas is high and going up.
4112 2018-12-15 22:24:20 Tasted of pure olive oil
4113 2018-12-15 22:24:20 You clearly have never been to the Escalante-staircase area!! 
People from around the WORLD come to enjoy The incredible beauty of that area and you are supporting ripping it up to get rich on oil!
You are disgusting!
4114 2018-12-15 22:24:18 Sounds stupid but round up gets oil out of concrete. Could give it a go
4115 2018-12-15 22:23:59 When u try to be a good daughter and clean out the refrigerator and accidentally throw out TONS of cbd oil and ruin the wknd 
4116 2018-12-15 22:23:47 Look into Black Seed Oil. (Amazon/Walmart/Health Food Stores) Massage and/or taken Internally. It and CBD Oil both helped my son with pain from Renal Cell Carcinoma. 
4117 2018-12-15 22:23:45 Yeah but you can't blame a more competitive market for their woes. As I asserted, that's just trade. 
Besides the price of oil remained frozen under Chavez's presidency.
That contributed to the devaluation of oil.
At the same time they have hyper inflation & a devalued currency.
4118 2018-12-15 22:23:42 Hahaha open the baby oil 
4119 2018-12-15 22:23:35 It's not really "them" that's the problem. It's certain snake oil salesmen on both sides of the aisle that keep taking advantage of them & the rest of us. They will only leave when we either vote them out or they find their snake oil doesn't sell anymore.
4120 2018-12-15 22:23:18 Can’t they loop it south thru USA and no Canadian oil for Quebec per their wishes!

4122 2018-12-15 22:23:08 Correct me if I'm wrong, but your argument is to wait until oil becomes scarce to the point that renewable energy is cheaper to produce. Wouldn't building the renewable energy infrastructure now be like being an early investor in kerosene?
4123 2018-12-15 22:23:08 Running low on beard oil. Time to re up.
4124 2018-12-15 22:22:55 She sorted it out alright - for herself and fellow CONS. She spunked North Sea oil on the unemployment bill, rather than invest it. She flogged off assets like council housing that Tax-payers had paid for leading to a  crisis in housing we are still paying for. And so much more.
4125 2018-12-15 22:22:49 nothing is perfect mate.oil discoulors straight away water doesn't take to many knocks partic on trim
4126 2018-12-15 22:22:46 Interesting that this field remains shut and there is zero impact in oil prices.
4127 2018-12-15 22:22:45 It was the oil industry that laid off all those workers while they still made fat profits. Why blame the government and not the oil industry?
4128 2018-12-15 22:22:21 That’s definitely possible. Hadn’t thought of that. I can have refined peanut oil (stripper of protein) but I might call in and see what they use.
4129 2018-12-15 22:22:18 これは人類の敗けですわ…
4130 2018-12-15 22:22:18 I’m about to fuck around and leave the dealer with a net car instead of an oil change ... 
4131 2018-12-15 22:22:09 Olive oil and mustard poor life decisions.
4132 2018-12-15 22:22:02 Beto is a big oil shill
4133 2018-12-15 22:21:53 You're funny...
4134 2018-12-15 22:21:40 I seen one parked on Ogden the other night, them shits are . But nah not if i gotta sell snake oil to sleepin people!
4135 2018-12-15 22:21:33 só por ter o both e o oil já ganhou de melhores do ano 
4136 2018-12-15 22:21:21 Looks like the oil boy is still on shift, look at that glisten !
4137 2018-12-15 22:21:20 "Environmental Recovery" led by a Texan in favor of off-shore fracking and oil? How does that work? Beto is charismatic but we supposedly have 12 years or less to avoid the worst of Climate Change with decisive, bold Climate Action! 
4138 2018-12-15 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
4139 2018-12-15 22:21:11 All I did was come in for an oil change, at the time of my appointment... but still I’m the last one left in the waiting room 
4140 2018-12-15 22:21:07 Today we were talking about avoiding charlatans and snake oil sellers. Only for a woman to say in agreement: yeah that’s why I take advice from my friend. She’s a life coach and telepath. TELEPATH. 
4141 2018-12-15 22:20:58 What if you agreed to be cooked and eaten by an internet cannibal but then you showed up at their house and they had like an L shaped island in a tiny square kitchen, or that kramer oil painting in their living room or some shit. A $2500 gaming chair.
4142 2018-12-15 22:20:54 You live in Seattle, you should add CBD oil 
4143 2018-12-15 22:20:52 Changing oil in personal transportation cube, then hoping to have a relaxing night of sketching (both Tardigrade and original scifi)
4144 2018-12-15 22:20:49 TO KILL AN ORANGUTAN

I was going to tell you this real cool way to make Nutella taste delicious but I just read the label again and I can't because it's made with palm oil.
4145 2018-12-15 22:20:39 As much as I love my new face oil and what it’s doing for my skin, it smells like fajitas
4146 2018-12-15 22:20:28 The Jack Herer sativa oil I just got is great. Boss Hogg sounds fun though
4147 2018-12-15 22:20:26 SOME people are either still restocking their cupboard stores years after moving out of their parents' home and/or use so much flour, sugar, and oil in everyday life that IT MAY RUN OUT AT ANY SECOND, IT'S NOT A RELIABLE CUPBOARD CONTENT also the sugar may have coffee drips in
4148 2018-12-15 22:20:25 I want a bike so I don't gotta worry about gas or oil changes and all that vehicle bs.
4149 2018-12-15 22:20:15 I just finished doing my hair 
Now coconut oil is dripping everywhere
Yay!
4150 2018-12-15 22:20:03 World Oil oligarchies are winning at the moment...we have to fight like hell to change it.
Can we do it outside govt???
4151 2018-12-15 22:19:57 I did, what of it? Now open the baby oil and get moving!
4152 2018-12-15 22:19:57 Is it an unreasonable conspiracy theory that gas is so cheap now because Saudi Arabia is artificially lowering oil prices to get political heat off them for killing a journalist?
4153 2018-12-15 22:19:57 Be his beard oil, yasssss
4154 2018-12-15 22:19:43 I’ll say this: Economists and Public Education mix like oil and water
4155 2018-12-15 22:19:37 i smell like nothing but coconut oil 
4156 2018-12-15 22:19:30 I never denied climate change and I agree something must be done, but to simply say "stop production of oil" is denying how pervasive it is to our society. People such as you who take a holier than thou approach cannot provide any reasonable, viable alternatives.
4157 2018-12-15 22:19:24 “2nd verse same as 1st” is precisely what his first few (great) films were not. WB seems to have turned the corner w/ Crude Oil, when he found European programmers will show any raw, unruly thing he throws together. It’s devolved to dare cinema.
4158 2018-12-15 22:19:16 Hot oil and sausage to the face
4159 2018-12-15 22:19:10 Bio oil & I use a scar gel like mederma but i use the generic store brand. Using both lightened mine up tons!!
4160 2018-12-15 22:19:08 It’s okay, “beautiful daddy” Trudeau just gave the oil industry exemptions from paris cuts, while still pretending to be a leader on the global stage for climate pushing
4161 2018-12-15 22:19:00 Dead

4163 2018-12-15 22:18:41 The other ones I think were made with some type of oil so it wouldn’t yellow but it would like make them greesy. Hella gross
4164 2018-12-15 22:18:29 Canada would think differently if they had any real intellectual property that China was ripping off.  Failing that, you are just following the money exporting whatever to whoever including your dirty oil.  BTW, why did you sign the USMCA & lower your restrictive tariffs on US?
4165 2018-12-15 22:18:22 It seems to me that energy should be a provision of a Country's National Security   .Without a secure source of Energy Canada can not defend itself if Eastern Canada is Dependant on Foreign Oil .The Government of the day should envoke  the Emergencies Act and build pipelines ....
4166 2018-12-15 22:18:17 Have you ever tried CBD oil?
4167 2018-12-15 22:18:13 Well done guys @AFoodbank if you know anyone who will go cold this winter, give us a tweet and we will donate 500ltrs of heating oil or 1/2 tonne of coal to your nominated individual..
4168 2018-12-15 22:17:58 It tasted of olive oil, it was disgusting
4169 2018-12-15 22:17:52 bullshit and gaslighting by oil companies at COP24 climate conference will cause the extinction of all life on earth in 10 years
4170 2018-12-15 22:17:47 Pwede jud bana? Kay akong balak tung baby oil cotton bus ug pulbos HAHAHA
4171 2018-12-15 22:17:46 @billshortenmp the expert on selling snake oil
4172 2018-12-15 22:17:43 Oil and vinegar current college standing
4173 2018-12-15 22:17:29 So bringing big ocean liners filled with Saudi oil is cheaper than pipelining from west to east? I think the billionaire Irving’s are deep in bed with the Saudi’s I’m sure a lot of their money is in a Saudi bank somewhere protected from the tax collecter
4174 2018-12-15 22:17:26 Mike, I've been on CBD oil for several months, no more back pain, depression or anxiety and no more meds. If interested, I'll put you in touch with the CEO of CBD BioCare Co.
4175 2018-12-15 22:17:25 This is an oil and gas industry lobbying account
4176 2018-12-15 22:17:25 On no oil diet for 2 days already. Stomach flu still strong. 
4177 2018-12-15 22:17:16 you know the future is looking great when a guy is getting paid by oil companies to say it’s fine because venus is 800 degrees and it’s still there
4178 2018-12-15 22:16:54 Itu baby oil apa olive oil si wkwkw
4179 2018-12-15 22:16:06 Canadian Maple Syrup is approximately 30 x the price of oil. Now you know. #NetflixDirtyMoney @Netflix_CA
4180 2018-12-15 22:16:01 Hmm...  Sha use rubber anyday you wan do am... If that 20litres of oil enter person...na oyun superglue..  Wa se ti
4181 2018-12-15 22:15:46 Combine 9 oz eggrolls with 4 cups baked Alaska. Blend with Olive Oil. Boil. Serve a la mode
4182 2018-12-15 22:15:45 Water and bio oil
4183 2018-12-15 22:15:40 Hahahah; oh, the seductive sounds of sesame oil.
4184 2018-12-15 22:15:40 Tea tree oil to clean it up and then pop it with clean tweezers!
4185 2018-12-15 22:15:34 What I don’t get about this idea is what would separation fix? I don’t think it would help get pipelines built. And might endanger moving large amounts of oil by rail, too.
4186 2018-12-15 22:15:26 Oil change
Gas
Picked up christmas wrapping paper

Adulting is tiring
4187 2018-12-15 22:15:13 Swear down, a new oil change is license to drive crazy for one week
4188 2018-12-15 22:15:02 If I was on chopped I would literally break into the liquor closet and then steal the truffle oil
4189 2018-12-15 22:14:59 How is she doing?  I wish her strength for her fight, since it is an ugly disease.  WTF are we waging war against Syria...Oh right, Oil.
Peace and let her fight HER fight.  And hope she helps us in our fight.  We need strong people, since we don't have anybody as strong as her.
4190 2018-12-15 22:14:45 When the rest of the world meets or even comes close to what the US has done, they can talk.  Until then, all they want to do is foist the cost of everyone else on the US.  BTW, when does Canada stop exporting their dirty oil to those not under any commitment?
4191 2018-12-15 22:14:34 It's also apparently a mature enough community to have trolls!!!?

(One of these days the Chemist and I are going to strip our basic Lodge pan and put down some flaxseed oil seasoning, which is allegedly magical.)
4192 2018-12-15 22:14:30 Vegan leather advocates are interesting. They don’t like leather even though it’s a byproduct industry (hides would be waste otherwise) and are supportive of the oil industry. Vegan leather is pleather (plastic) 
4193 2018-12-15 22:14:27 We only use the in-room essential oil diffusers if a little extra humidity is required. Good with eucalyptus oil for colds! Otherwise our furnace has a centralized humidifier.
4194 2018-12-15 22:14:19 That's hot. The oil matches are so sexy
4195 2018-12-15 22:14:18 My god mother made this oil man and when I say I feel good..I FEEL GOOD
4196 2018-12-15 22:14:15 I’m glad olive oil believes victims of abuse :P
4197 2018-12-15 22:14:11 Oga @DeleMomodu  how was OBJ govt better. Oil was sold at higher price with nothing to show for it. Increasing price of petrol every new year. You re not in Nigeria
4198 2018-12-15 22:13:54 I’m sure we could survive if we only use oil for plastics. There’s no point in arguing with ppl who don’t believe climate change is real. You’re already an expert at avoiding facts and obvs have this AB oil pride thing going on.
4199 2018-12-15 22:13:35 @RepThompson @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
4200 2018-12-15 22:13:33 He served alright,   he served the Koch BROTHERS  and oil companies.   He also served HIMSELF  a big chunk of TAXPAYER dollars.   Maybe you can share a cell.
4201 2018-12-15 22:13:28 Why is it you never bitch or protest about Saudi oil or US oil? Is it because Tides pays your way to focus only on Canada ?
4202 2018-12-15 22:13:16 If you twisted their arm with equalisation payments, there's a strong possibility they might like Alberta oil a little more.
Just saying.
4203 2018-12-15 22:13:15 Alberta's issue is that their oil isn't wanted by the only customer they developed over the past 50 years. Now they want to sell to those who already have too much.
4204 2018-12-15 22:13:14 Lol I was getting my oil changed and geno scooped me up from the dealer while it was being done 
4205 2018-12-15 22:12:57 おれもさ、ﾄﾞﾊﾞｧと行きたい日もあるわけよ。。
4206 2018-12-15 22:12:45 Have you thought about selling shirts or hoodies? I want to support you more, but I do not need, nor any I know, needs CBD products. My uncle used cbd oil when he was diagnosed with cancer to deal with the pain. It was the only thing that truly gave him relief.
4207 2018-12-15 22:12:42 Moved from there 20 years ago. Now Colorado is the same. Super majority of dems in the State and Polis wants 100% renewable energy AND single payer healthcare. We aren’t in debt because of our oil and gas and I have good health insurance through my company.
4208 2018-12-15 22:12:41 My family’s used CBD oil for yrs & have found @CBDAmericanSh 
(CBD American Shaman) to be professional/reliable. We were referred to them by my mom’s holistic MD to help manage anxiety. Faves are the capsules, equine strength ointment, & TOPICAL SERUM for amazingly fast healing.
4209 2018-12-15 22:12:40 Pick a fat 
- almond butter 
- coconut or flaxseed oil 
- avocado 
- cashews 
- pecans 
- etc.
4210 2018-12-15 22:12:34 hahahahahahahahahah......what next ,lets get back to whale oil?
4211 2018-12-15 22:12:29 The problem is renewable enerhy hasn't reached a point where it is economically feasible. Ontario tried to go all in on renewables and is up to its eyeballs in debt. Not saying renewables are not worthy of investment, they are not yet at the point where they cqn replace oil.
4212 2018-12-15 22:12:28 Is this a defense of Saudi oil vs Canadian oil?  No CO2 there?
4213 2018-12-15 22:12:20 빨간머리앤 보온병이요ㅠㅠ
4214 2018-12-15 22:12:09 Thats good..ilove my language proudly hausa bahaushiyar asali Allah yasa mu koyi turancin muma
4215 2018-12-15 22:12:08 I wouldn't go that far..but I get your frustration when you hear stupidities like the 'dirty oil" comment.
4216 2018-12-15 22:12:06 Sesame seed oil
4217 2018-12-15 22:11:30 Everyone is just growing alright weed and focusing on the oil. Not about it
4218 2018-12-15 22:11:18 Decided to try different finishes on each of my lanterns. The one of the left is a Puritan pine stain and the one on the right of just sealed with Danish oil. Can’t wait to get “candles” in them.
4219 2018-12-15 22:11:00 *THC oil 
4220 2018-12-15 22:10:56 I want a facial oil too.
4221 2018-12-15 22:10:55 I even put on oil to make my hair sleek r u proud of me
4222 2018-12-15 22:10:49 Probably will be some rich oil man...
4223 2018-12-15 22:10:32 Vacuumed the whole damn house today. Swiffer wetjet the living room/dining room floors. But I really need to get out the scrub brush & get down & wash the floors with oil soap this winter. Badly.
4224 2018-12-15 22:10:31 $300M daily of foreign oil. No Coker refineries yet in NB and QC to handle crude, and no EE pipe to feed such Coker refineries. Irving has said they would upgrade refineries if it were equitable.
4225 2018-12-15 22:10:26 The beard oil?!
4226 2018-12-15 22:10:20 been trying cbd oil with limited success,pretty weak,prob as its from hemp and not actual Cannabis,dont bother with the expensive Holland and Barrett stuff,over priced ans under strenghth,typical British way as always,second rate.
4227 2018-12-15 22:10:14 What if there was a process to get the oil out if the tar sands that greatly reduces the carbon footprint? Answer- Yes there is. My friend has a patented process that works. The federal government should look into it. Contact me for his name.
4228 2018-12-15 22:10:04 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
4229 2018-12-15 22:09:57 Further. I don’t buy his non-point about the comparison between oil and lithium production. It’s a non point because lithium production will need to be ramped up to meet the demand, cancelling any benefits of reducing oil production. That’s Lamborg’s point and it stand.
4230 2018-12-15 22:09:37 Can I get one that expires in March??  I’m not gonna need another oil change in a month
4231 2018-12-15 22:09:15 oh common you know GOP and  Truth goes like oil and water .. they can only polute it...
4232 2018-12-15 22:09:13 1 ltr of Saudis blood oil is to much Gerry
4233 2018-12-15 22:09:06 Yes to the MCT oil 
4234 2018-12-15 22:08:59 Oh Wankel engines are great, slight issues with oil burn and tip wear but pretty 
4235 2018-12-15 22:08:52 Nah, you can, really! Honestly, drying with a towel is probably worse then using mild soap. Dry it on a burner, then rub the oil while it's still hot.
4236 2018-12-15 22:08:48 Just tried a new beard wash and oil, all I can say is I’m in LOVE with this stuff. Took my beard from corse and scratchy to smooth and soft with just the first try!
4237 2018-12-15 22:08:48 I should clarify that unlike a lot of folks I don’t hate the energy (oil & gas) sector. Despite environmental issues they’re why our civilization exists & why close to 8 billion people can live on Earth. It’s time for it to be replaced as a primary power source though.
4238 2018-12-15 22:08:45 @WayfareFoods Soooo excited! Found your products at Wegmans and loaded up: butter, dips, cream cheese - yay! And no palm oil. My new best friends! 
4239 2018-12-15 22:08:44 I have a Question,   Why does eastern Canada import their oil from Saudi Arabia and pay a higher price than they could get it from western provinces of Canada and create tons of jobs across the nation, seem like sort of a win, win, win deal to me !
4240 2018-12-15 22:08:39 Oil portrait in progress...
4241 2018-12-15 22:08:30 Please provide an example of anything that is part of modern society that is not made with oil or derived from oil based products or is fueled by or lubricated with oil based products or manufacture without using oil. You can't.
4242 2018-12-15 22:08:23 Add THC oil for a real kick
4243 2018-12-15 22:08:17 Coconut oil works for some but it made my hair dry and my skin ashy af lmao
4244 2018-12-15 22:08:14 We will change the oil na

So much noise regarding climate change.  So few electric cars on the road?.  Confusion why?  Oh Oil companies OK!
4246 2018-12-15 22:08:07 Making latkes for friends tonight. This year, in addition to representing the oil that kept the temple lit for 8 days, the oil (and more importantly the temp of the oil) represents HOW MAD I WILL BE IF COTTON’S DUMB AMENDMENT GETS ADDED TO THE FIRST STEP ACT! Thank you.
4247 2018-12-15 22:07:56 Possibly because the vast majority of U.S. oil does not come by boat but rather the pipelines and trains also depicted on the graphic?
4248 2018-12-15 22:07:47 Damn I should’ve had you do my oil change, I just went to kwik kar yesterday lol
4249 2018-12-15 22:07:45 Increased youth unemployment, cut regulations to increase oil production, raised consumer confidence, moved the embassy to Jerusalem, highest black business ownership ever, fights for religious rights.
4250 2018-12-15 22:07:19 Lucifer knowing that Micheal would get rejected, he had a dead corpse summoned in circle of holy oil.  He made sure that when Micheal gets rejected, Micheal would straight into that dead corpse where they can kill him and finish him off.
4251 2018-12-15 22:07:17 The #Bush family's inter-generational #Covert community involvement and subsequent rise to power is AT LEAST troubling, considering during that same time #Putin (also an oil man from the covert community) rose to the top of #Russia, and now controls the @GOP executive figurehead.
4252 2018-12-15 22:07:11 depends on the kind of sick, but if it's a cold/flu: chicken noodle soup (chicken, onion, garlic, carrot, celery, bell pepper, spaghetti) seasoned with toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, and aleppo pepper
4253 2018-12-15 22:07:08 Apparently it's not good to use household oil because it will attract dirt and gum things up.
4254 2018-12-15 22:06:56 Kinda pissed that my future is being stolen from me by oil companies that just want a profit
4255 2018-12-15 22:06:50 At the time the additional taxes came in it was ridiculous, fortunately the global oil price fell. What was it $/l in Dunners
4256 2018-12-15 22:06:39 The reality is we had the conservatives for over 40 years making a mess and hiding it from us when we where busy enjoying the money following from the oil and gas and we trusted them that they are working for the future of the province until the last election 1/2
4257 2018-12-15 22:06:38 What a lot of Yisraelites who are comfortable living next to massa is  not aware of is that the whites are not just running to Ghana and other  African countries like Ghana because they could actually buy a land with  gold, diamonds or oil in their backyard but also because...
4258 2018-12-15 22:06:20 How can you say that. Besides being corrupt as help, he portioned off our precious National Parks to coal and oil industries. Disgusting.
4259 2018-12-15 22:06:19 Then mouse over the bars for oil and gas in the side panel when you view different countries. You'll see that the carbon intensity of gas is 490gCO2eq/kWh of electricity, oil is 650gCO2eq/kWh. #Wind is 11gCO2eq/kWh!
4260 2018-12-15 22:06:17 I am not very bright but can someone point me in the direction of something that explains how limiting production to reduce a glut of oil on the world market and building pipelines to increase the amount of oil on the world market both benefit Alberta?
4261 2018-12-15 22:06:17 Gasoline price should be $0.40/Litre, not $1.40/Litre! Put the oil companies into their place!
4262 2018-12-15 22:06:07 Chillaxing is kinda hard in this weather
I keep glitching and my bones r squicking like theyre rusty
Oil me with ur humour
4263 2018-12-15 22:06:04 a lot of people say that the trump presidency is a hard pill to swallow but have you ever tried fish oil? now those things are HUGE
4264 2018-12-15 22:05:59 Yes. Yes. Yes. My absolute favourite. If it gets too scary, use anointing oil on your bedroom door.
4265 2018-12-15 22:05:57 Came in for an oil change, left with four new tires and an alignment fix. Ok anndddddddddd...nobody’s getting Christmas presents from me
4266 2018-12-15 22:05:53 My granny really bought that dumb organic peanut butter with *no palm oil, added sugar or salt* and it's really more peanut than butter.
I want to fight
4267 2018-12-15 22:05:43 - Wash your hair 2-4 times a week
- Curling and flat irons tend to slowly dry out your hair so try to stop using those
- If you use heat to style your hair, use a heat protectant spray
- Oil your hair 2-5 times a month to see your hair grow strong and shiny
4268 2018-12-15 22:05:42 Thank you, @RyanZinke for destroying the Departof the Interior. Your legacy will be one of corruption and graft. You’ve sold the People’s land to your cronies in the oil industry. #GoodFuckingRiddance
4269 2018-12-15 22:05:36 Energy Stocks continue to get hammered this week as Oil and Natural Gas prices dropped.   The talk  is world economies are slowing reducing demand for oil.  And USA is drilling record amounts of oil & gas.  OPEC /Russia plans to cut production didn't do much to help prices
4270 2018-12-15 22:05:07 You’re suggesting that the government step in and forbid the import of oil?
4271 2018-12-15 22:04:57 I almost burned down my apartment. I forgot a pot of heating oil in the kitchen.

Smh for myself
4272 2018-12-15 22:04:50 Health care is a right- Health INSURANCE is a product- you are blending oil & water.
4273 2018-12-15 22:04:31 "You can be sure of Shell." - Shell Oil
4274 2018-12-15 22:04:21 Nick, another onside argument saying The preponderanceof evidence points to man made climate change, which means carbon taxes are required and we must get of of oil

Give me a break, saying it does not make it so
4275 2018-12-15 22:04:12 Even cooking oil will sort that. ;)
4276 2018-12-15 22:04:02 Fusion will be the ultimate primary energy source once commercialised but is currently not yet in the pilot plant phase. Once someone gets a self-sustaining fusion reactor working, R&D for commercialisation will pour in. I expect the oil&gas majors to be part of that phase.
4277 2018-12-15 22:03:56 You want to end the use of oil. That is an impossible task. What can be done is to develop technology that reduces pollution. Our pollution output is 90% lower than the 1960s due to improved efficiencies. We are doing better and advancements will continue.
4278 2018-12-15 22:03:51 Anointing Oil , Blessed Candles & Cleansing Bath Salt. 
4279 2018-12-15 22:03:48 Those foreign oil companies work within the regulatory framework. The money @WBrettWilson is talking about is attempting to create the framework. They are not Canadian and not working in the best interests of Canadians
4280 2018-12-15 22:03:36 I think that in the long run nuclear (fusion) will essentially supply our power requirements. Oil & gas will continue to be used for petrochemicals, which will result in a much smaller industry than today. However, we’ll likely need it for centuries, just not for energy.
4281 2018-12-15 22:03:32 Ham, anchovy and pineapple pizza with fresh provolone and basil oil.
4282 2018-12-15 22:03:08 The good, honest businesses are failing like crazy. But the cheats, cons, grifters, unhealthy, cheap, & flimsy are all doing very well under the Trump Administration.
This leaves more room for many more Pro-Trump Industries like oil, gas, coal, prisons, chemical,  & weapons! 
4283 2018-12-15 22:03:04 Absolutely but it moves oil in the meantime. Less efficient but still effective. Your government just bought like a million tanker cars.
4284 2018-12-15 22:02:55 i just inexplicably (literally can’t understand how i got here) found the trashiest $1 e-book about a rich japanese housewife who falls in love with her female swim instructor while her american oil executive husband is away and it’s driving me crazy
4285 2018-12-15 22:02:41 It's just better in English as the thread wasn't referred to a single region....pple who don't get Hausa can key in...
4286 2018-12-15 22:02:40 Actually I'm aware of power plays and imperial designs, also aware of UK desires to retain control of Mid-East Oil come what may, to suggest the UK forced Hitler's hand i's one view I don't subscribe too, my opinions on Asia Pac are different.
4287 2018-12-15 22:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
4288 2018-12-15 22:02:31 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
4289 2018-12-15 22:02:27 I signed up for an oil painting class at Creatively Wild Art Studio in DUMBO. During my last class there the teacher made us tea and I had a great time chatting with the other student. She encouraged me to take another class during her usual time.
4290 2018-12-15 22:02:24 Measure that carbon footprint from large tanker compared to pipeline? 
So is this your argument against energy east?
Maybe your argument should be against Saudi oil? 
What side of the fence are you on here?
4291 2018-12-15 22:02:20 Lemon, olive oil, oregano. Really tasty.
4292 2018-12-15 22:02:20 I finally discovered the source of non-stop annoying squeaking and it turns out it's my outside storage door. Specifically the lock.

I don't have appropriate oil or else I would be slathering it all over the damn thing.

4297 2018-12-15 22:02:04 Although Grapeseed oil is still used mainly as a massage oil is now being recognized as a wonderful anti-aging properties
4298 2018-12-15 22:02:03 I bought stuff to make sandwiches & made one immediately when I got home bc I was so hungry & omg, so good. Oatnut bread, mayo (with olive oil), mesquite turkey, provolone AND muenster, banana peppers & Famous Dave's sweet & spicy pickles. Yes.
4299 2018-12-15 22:02:01 Like mixing oil and water
4300 2018-12-15 22:01:52 And oil.
4301 2018-12-15 22:01:49 I’m no oil painting but I’ve excepted that

4308 2018-12-15 22:01:18 How about shoving that pipeline where the sun doesn’t shine. We don’t need more oil. We need to get rid of it.
4309 2018-12-15 22:01:17 It’s just a quote used to describe the larger picture; preserving nature is much more important than finding more oil.
4310 2018-12-15 22:01:10 Slowly more people are!:)

4314 2018-12-15 22:00:44 Prize for oil&gas is keeping their infrastructure at work. Means synthetic fuels from atmospheric CO2 & H2 from water. Needs high temperature primary energy. High temp. reactors or concentrating solar. Nuclear is 24/7 so more productive. My money would be on high temp. fission.
4315 2018-12-15 22:00:44 Coconut oil makes me smell like freshly baked cookies, mmmhh I love
4316 2018-12-15 22:00:40 @Kaitlin_Coppock  I’m going through Astro magic withdrawal.

4319 2018-12-15 22:00:18 When I was on vacation this summer I went in this little boutique olive oil store and got a bottle of chipotle olive oil and it has changed the game for so many things. My veggies especially are on another level
4320 2018-12-15 22:00:16 Oil, salt, sugar, dash of vinegar
4321 2018-12-15 22:00:10 December 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4322 2018-12-15 21:59:59 Oil Subsidy is a scam! 

Osinbajo (25/08/18; The Cable): We’ve saved N1.4trn by not paying fuel subsidy.

Now, owing marketers N1T for subsidy 

Osinbajo (14/12/18; VP debate): Where do you expect the poor to get N40 on each liter of petrol if subsidy is removed?

APC lying liars
4323 2018-12-15 21:59:50 Ai kuwa dai 
4324 2018-12-15 21:59:47 You know you’re old when your Saturday is LIT because of the specialty infused virgin olive oil set you bought yourself.  #ThisIs30
4325 2018-12-15 21:59:44 Trump needs enemies to divert Americans attention from his corruption. Iran(Who was meeting treaty requirements) is a good choice. Buy keeping their oil off market they enrich Saudi’s who were approaching financial instability. They keep fossil fuel corps. In huge profits.Ross?
4326 2018-12-15 21:59:16 Look up Lac Magantic and then tell me why oil should be transported by rail. It’s more expensive, emits more CO2, and less efficient.
4327 2018-12-15 21:59:15 Of course, but it’s not a matter of belief - it’s fact. 

CO2 has risen from ~285ppm (where it was for about 2M years +\- 15ppm) to 412ppm+. The extra carbon is from burning fossil fuels (coal oil gas) that was sequestered for millions of years.

Greenhouse Effect is fact too.
4328 2018-12-15 21:59:09 i want to learn how to oil paint someday
4329 2018-12-15 21:59:08 Oh, you mean the Paris Accord that Shell Oil helped write? Got it.
4330 2018-12-15 21:59:02 There is huge support in every province except Quebec. The one that would profit the most from transfer payments. Replace foreign oil NOW!
4331 2018-12-15 21:59:00 100% worth it, It's medicine :) Better than buying SSRIs, Ibuprofen, and tons of other medication, Full Spectrum CBD Oil is all in one! Also, there aren't really any negative side effects, unless you take too much then it'll make you drowsy
4332 2018-12-15 21:58:50 Among the developed countries, Canada has an important energy sector ie oil industry, therefore getting it to the market by building transmountain pipeline is essential for our economy.
@ElizabethMay @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @MichelleRempel @DanAlbas @PierrePoilievre
4333 2018-12-15 21:58:45 what is olive oil made off
4334 2018-12-15 21:58:43 Oil & vinegar under achiever. 
4335 2018-12-15 21:58:43 I cqn guarantee you  that if the oil was being extracted from Quebec and that province asked for a pipeline to the west coast, nothing would stop that pipeline from being built.
4336 2018-12-15 21:58:36 A type of oil at work
4337 2018-12-15 21:58:25 Well really I do a mix of lemon juice and olive oil but that name wasn’t as fun 
4338 2018-12-15 21:58:23 coconut oil clogs ur pores so i would drop that!!
4339 2018-12-15 21:58:16 Or if you use @wirexapp seems like the wild west all these snake oil merchants coming out of the wood work plz @TheFCA bring some confidence to the crypto community
4340 2018-12-15 21:58:16 The end of this year is so intense. Too many things happening at once. Kanye/Drake/Arianna/Pete/Nicki, Cardi/Offset, LindaIkeji, People taking oil out of the gutter to resell, VP debates, Prada and their mess. Make it stop!
4341 2018-12-15 21:58:14 The United States was the vision for the future until it got co-opted by the military industrial complex, big oil, big pharma, the insurance companies - sadly, it is no longer a representative democracy. It is an oligarchy run by the rich.
4342 2018-12-15 21:58:06 I really wish more people recognized that a drizzle of good oil can instantly elevate most dishes.

I keep a small bottle of olive oil at my desk to jazz up otherwise boring prepared soups. And when I order out for Thai, a little toasted sesame oil can make a huge difference!
4343 2018-12-15 21:58:02 For far too long Alberta's Oil Industry  has been subjected to propaganda that degenerates the industry. I'm happy to finally see push back on this. Thank you!!!!
4344 2018-12-15 21:57:50 Let's get this straight: deep-water rigs will leak. Oil co's. will be lackadaisicle @ fixing them. Terminate off-shore oil mining!
4345 2018-12-15 21:57:42 Gosh. Insult an Iranian and find yourself staked by a Persian (or quite a few). So the US, Great Britain and their oil companies had nothing to do with the events in Iran in the 50's? Well I never...

4347 2018-12-15 21:57:39 You must save Alaska from oil drilling now.

4349 2018-12-15 21:57:31 some light is forever on in my car if it ain’t the engine it’s the oil change 
4350 2018-12-15 21:57:27 but really...here's the real problem with spain. NO HOT SAUCE
WHAT IS WITH YOU SPAIN YOU COLONIZE ALL OF SOUTH AMERICA AND THE  CARIBBEAN  ONLY TO EAT NOTHING BUT OIL AND SALT 24/7 #smdh
4351 2018-12-15 21:57:26 Trump didn’t build no fortune he inherited it and he only became president with the help of Russia.Trump is a Snake Oil Salesman. #DonTheCon45
4352 2018-12-15 21:57:26 I slept several nights in the recliner. It’s the worst. I don’t know if it helped or if was coincidence, but I diffused the Thieves essential oil and that was the turning point for me.
4353 2018-12-15 21:57:21 ... as well as of global oil trade, US cheap food policy and venture capitalism
4354 2018-12-15 21:57:17 1 technically but why can every Saturday not be a day that you go out and ensure you support at last one small #business in your #local area.
Imaging the impact if everyone did this across the #UK
4355 2018-12-15 21:57:10 "Other O&G economies are thriving."
For economies with much lower extraction costs than the oil sands, that's true. That said, the supply glut and the associated low world prices are painful to all oil producers.
4356 2018-12-15 21:57:05 As sad as it is that you're willing to trade on the country's unity to try to resuscitate your failed political career, what's really pathetic is your willingness to sacrifice my kids' futures.

Your oil is making the planet uninhabitable!
4357 2018-12-15 21:57:05 A "good night sleep" kit with a blindfold, earplugs, and a nice soothing massage oil!
4358 2018-12-15 21:56:57 I clean them in the dishwasher and rub in a little oil and they cook eggs perfectly. I use them for stove to oven cooking.
4359 2018-12-15 21:56:54 That's false. 80% of oil in Ontario comes from the US or Canada. Oil shipped by rail is huge. Most of the trains I see are carrying oil and heading east.
4360 2018-12-15 21:56:47 Republicans send troops to wars of greed.
Democrats just pretend to care for them,
While helping the republicans send them to die for corporate profits.
America is an Oil Company with an Army.
At least Republicans are upfront with wanting everyone to suffer and/or die.
4361 2018-12-15 21:56:43 The smell in the five guys near me is stomach turning old oil. Get thee to chateau blanc.
4362 2018-12-15 21:56:34 @terrycrews If I understand it right, you did that painting with acrylic paints, right? So not oil painting wet-on-wet like Ross, right? (I'm a painting noob, but I'd love to tinker one day when I have $ and space for it :D )
4363 2018-12-15 21:56:25 Asweaarrigaadd 
4364 2018-12-15 21:56:18 I just ate seven servings of stuffed vine leaves, pretty sure half my blood plasma is composed of olive oil now
4365 2018-12-15 21:56:08 So... now you’re pro oil? As long as it’s imported from Saudi Arabia? You DO realize that you’re supposed to be working for Canadians, right?
4366 2018-12-15 21:56:08 Someone teach me how to change the oil in my car
4367 2018-12-15 21:56:07 @Toyota FYI, left my 11:45AM appointment @CrystalToyota without service yesterday. One hour into my oil change and my car still wasn’t taken (and three were still ahead of me???) Returning on Monday with the hopes of more efficient service. #Whyshouldwemakeappointments
4368 2018-12-15 21:56:00 One thing I hate about oil changes is WAITING 
4369 2018-12-15 21:55:46 All this essential oil this, essential oil that, Whatever happened to a good ol candle that's a fraction of the cost? 

Plus, Have you ever seen an essential oil give off light?
4370 2018-12-15 21:55:41 It was “frozen” money from the sale of Iran’s oil. If Iran’s money is returned to Iran, surely it can’t be called a gift???? I am sure you feel really stupid now..
4371 2018-12-15 21:55:40 Think i know why oil lobbyists @AndrewScheer @jkenney @ABDanielleSmith been so busy along with merchant of doubt steve malloy in US.  Big climate convention just closed with agreement on emissions
4372 2018-12-15 21:55:15 I said damn there’s no butter for my OATMEAL this nigga said use OIL
4373 2018-12-15 21:55:14 Self care is getting your car washed and oil changed
4374 2018-12-15 21:55:08 Almost all climate scientists disagree that we need to extract more oil.  Have you ever talked to Katharine Hayhoe- she's in your district.
4375 2018-12-15 21:54:40 The mysterious package that arrived on my doorstep contained a peculiar, unsettling oil painting that depicted a figure who looked eerily similar to myself getting stabbed through the heart with a wooden stake. Good thing I locked all the doors to my house, so no one can get i--
4376 2018-12-15 21:54:29 It hardly matters where Quebec actually gets its oil.  The point is that there are pipelines in Quebec, they use oil and have no intention to do otherwise.  Quebec is part of Canada.  Why not let Canadian oil pass through it?
4377 2018-12-15 21:54:22 Only the snake oil salesman can solve our other religions problem!
4378 2018-12-15 21:54:16 Can’t fall for the snake oil salesman, who likes to grab them by .... 
but if you’re interested, I have a bridge in Brooklyn for sale!
4379 2018-12-15 21:54:16 No. Ven sells oil on the global market and that has always been its source of revenue. It has always subsidized domestic oil consumption. So if all you got is that they respect the former prez a lot, well, I think maybe you don't have the leg up in this discussion and you know it
4380 2018-12-15 21:54:12 Tonight, in my bed, a few minutes away from dozing off to the beautiful land of sleep,I’m eternally grateful for my very ordinary bedroom, my daffaya , and the smell of lavender oil hovering in the air. I love you universe, be good to me.
4381 2018-12-15 21:54:12 my life’s a mess so lemme slather some coconut oil on it and buy some new setting spray, that should fix it right ¿
4382 2018-12-15 21:54:05 I just spent $60 on oil for my car
4383 2018-12-15 21:54:05 Northern Gateway, Trans Mountain, Energy East. All projects stopped or not going forward because of the federal government and our other “partners” in Confederation. Meanwhile, the home your in is heated by Saudi oil.

4385 2018-12-15 21:54:02 Got a free oil change 
4386 2018-12-15 21:53:41 Say it in English if you're confident. Oniranu oshi. This is the same vibe culture we're talking of, youre not intelligent enough to come up with a proper response so you jump on insults. You can organise the educative session on twitter na for men that are on the streets.
4387 2018-12-15 21:53:34 Any reasonable American would question the nature of the relationship given the history of our two nations. We are weaker than you, & don’t stand up to transgressions (real or perceived)  because of money & oil. We have little in common save regional stability & containing Iran
4388 2018-12-15 21:53:32 Oregano Oil, since it is as nasty as can be to mix with water and drink it down, this year I added it to coconut oil into some veggie caps ! The whole family is willing to use it daily now during the season 
4389 2018-12-15 21:53:17 mad because i bought some bull shit ass cbd oil smh
4390 2018-12-15 21:52:57 Steaming with olbas oil always helps me - I get really bad sinus problems. Hope you feel better!
4391 2018-12-15 21:52:52 New tires 
Oil changed 
Car washed and vacuumed 

I need an "I Adulted Today" sweatshirt!
4392 2018-12-15 21:52:49 Well Fuck. Our heating has failed because we ran out of oil. The nearest time to get New Oil is on monday and by then we'll have lost all remaining warmth. I WOULD DIE FOR AN ELECTRIC HEATER RN.
4393 2018-12-15 21:52:39 My mom told me to make pizza and now there’s so much olive oil on my hands that I can’t hold my phone
4394 2018-12-15 21:52:35 Irving Oil’s President would not keep receiving Saudi oil if you did the right thing and blocked oil shipments!
4395 2018-12-15 21:52:33 Me too. I'm reasonably sure it isn't olive oil, or I'd have been halfway to dead ages ago, so that at least is good
4396 2018-12-15 21:52:32 Oil producing Arab states are not making the major profits. Almost 90% of Iraq's Oil for example is extracted by Western Corporations who pay no or very little tax in Iraq.
To suggest that the 3rd or developing world is to blame is shifting blame.
4397 2018-12-15 21:52:20 I think it works both ways. Tempted to see midnight oil in London in June but it's £57! That's a fair bit.
4398 2018-12-15 21:52:18 The PM never said anything of the sort. He bought a fucking pipeline that Kinder Morgan couldn't get built. With Canadian Taxpayer money. Is that not a commitment to get your oil to market? You people are delusional.
4399 2018-12-15 21:52:16 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4400 2018-12-15 21:51:57 No but love olive oil
4401 2018-12-15 21:51:42 GE's vision killed it. Did not see the rise of #cleanenergy and its impact on Turbines & Oil. Taming of the Sun & Blowing Winds is helping our air but the silent streams are being killed by lack of compassion by Trump & his #EPA.
4402 2018-12-15 21:51:33 I still change my own. I would change yours if you lived closer. Mobil 1 full synthetic is $23 for 5 quarts and filters vary but I make sure I get a great filter and correct oil . Lots if scammers in Indiana use cheap oil
4403 2018-12-15 21:51:29 Is there oil in Japan? Make up some WMD Bullshit and the country is ours...well and the Yanks
4404 2018-12-15 21:51:26 So no tanker ban in eastern Canada so New Brunswick can import foreign oil, process it then ship it to the US?
Do you even realize how insane that is given what has been done to Alberta?

4405 2018-12-15 21:51:08 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
I have been looking for trading PC but the prices are pretty high. I'd only buy a decent  PC instead. Multiple monitors stand is really unnecessary. I'd put 2 monitors side by side and still make money from trading WTI. Less is more so I can focus on the trading.
4406 2018-12-15 21:51:08 Educative and interactive session indeed! When you tweet, they'll call you a twitter feminist and say you're not doing anything to help the situation.When you speak, they say go into the streets if you're serious. Now we're doing that,this one is harping on interactive session
4407 2018-12-15 21:50:52 I need th oil droplets for my face, my skin been dry than a mf ugh
4408 2018-12-15 21:50:52 Borders were defined in that year due to fishing rights, though conveniently the waters they took are some of the richest, also held many gas and oil rigs
4409 2018-12-15 21:50:43 We need too divorce ourselves from the Fed gov't n do our own thing, true but we, as in human species, can't let up on the DT's of the world. It's greed that motivates coal n oil ppl...
4410 2018-12-15 21:50:42 I dont know about the rest but, he got donations from many employers that worked at oil and, gas companies not directly from them. Very misleading which makes me question the rest.
4411 2018-12-15 21:50:41 You can not worry and Pray...its like mixing oil and water...#DyingToLive @KodakBlack1k
4412 2018-12-15 21:50:31 I got my oil changed today without anyone telling me to do it 
4413 2018-12-15 21:50:30 Caster oil packs. Seriously, can’t do any harm & has been a God’s send for many.
4414 2018-12-15 21:50:23 Took my two kids to @FarmerTedsFarm today, ordered my coeliac son what I thought was a gluten free meal, only to find out the food had been cooked in the same oil as gluten products  so angry, upset and outraged. My little boy could've been so ill.
4415 2018-12-15 21:50:16 I gargled with clove oil/warm water and rubbed peppermint oil/coconut oil on my throat .. sore throat went away after 15 mins and stayed away. I dont know if it was a fluke but I’m not complaining.
4416 2018-12-15 21:50:12 Pressure cooks plus it fries with a delicate mist of oil!!! I need crispiness!
4417 2018-12-15 21:49:59 Canada doesn't prevent Alberta from getting oil to market. The market does. Maybe if you refined it there, you could get more $ per barrel. It doesn't take more than it gets from Alberta. Ontario subsidized Alberta for decades. It'll do it again. Confederation is a partnership.
4418 2018-12-15 21:49:56 I’ve been adding olive oil to the water. It helps a bit.
4419 2018-12-15 21:49:45 somebody came into work and asked for beard oil today
4420 2018-12-15 21:49:40 I don’t think that’s meant to come across as bad as it sounds. I only work on a supply and install basis with 1 man and 1 labourer, with oil boilers and full systems it’s got to be impossible to stay under.
4421 2018-12-15 21:49:32 Castor oil! Put some on ur brows and eyelashes at night~ also good for dryness

4426 2018-12-15 21:49:09 No. But he likes our oil, unlike the PM. Try telling Quebec they can’t sell anymore Hydro because it’s too environmentally harmful. See how well that goes over.

4431 2018-12-15 21:48:52 With 9,000 new IRS agent you'd think they could have made Al Sharpton pay his taxes.

I will wake up to Swiss papers (Davos) and there will be no climate news. It is time to tell them to quit funding Al Quaeda for Oil
4440 2018-12-15 21:48:01 I’m sitting up here talking about going to Charlotte when I need a whole oil change 
4441 2018-12-15 21:47:59 That's the question that none of them can answer since oil is so intertwined with every part of modern society.
4442 2018-12-15 21:47:42 Frying with a teaspoon of oil and getting food that's crispy is magic. Also very simple to operate. Just two buttons to manoeuvre. Brilliant piece of engineering :)

4444 2018-12-15 21:47:27 waiting to get my oil changed right next to s&p so i decided to get a beer n some wingz hell yeah
4445 2018-12-15 21:47:20 The Venezuelan economy is 80% controlled by the private sector.  They are to blame for the country's problems, along with worldwide low oil prices (part of the amazing free market, dontcha know).
4446 2018-12-15 21:47:18 Almost time for an oil change 
4447 2018-12-15 21:47:12 Today situation in Alberta is result of your previously protests against pipelines and oil sands. At least keep low profile. Enough insulting our intelligence.
4448 2018-12-15 21:46:56 Specifically about oil & gas companies; what do you think of this idea: Instead of them investing in wind & solar (which many of the majors are beginning to do), they invest in R&D for fusion. Less immediate but ultimately far bigger payoffs for everyone.
4449 2018-12-15 21:46:54 Grapeseed oil is often used as a carrier oil in aroma therapy blends.
4450 2018-12-15 21:46:54 Make sure you choose an organic, cold pressed 100% pure Grapeseed Oil for massage therapy and as a skin moisturizer.
4451 2018-12-15 21:46:53 1/2 Democrats need to stop taking money from big tech. That being said, there is no excuse for the gop to take money from the NRA (like I said Russians use the nra to give republicans money) and for them to take money from big oil and coal when we need to start making decisions
4452 2018-12-15 21:46:43 because I sprayed the pans and there was a lot of oil. I was trying to soak it up
4453 2018-12-15 21:46:36 Did you really just justify the importation of Saudi oil?
4454 2018-12-15 21:46:31 I need to find a face cleanser for sensitive skin that I can use to get rid of my dark marks on my face ... I use vitamin e oil on my face after I wash it daily ... somebody point me in the right direction please  cause my skin would be popping without the dark marks

4458 2018-12-15 21:46:03 What's the jist?
4459 2018-12-15 21:45:54 The point is that behavior like this is obviously more prevalent in a place like the market where uneducated people are concentrated,you won't see this type of behavior on this scale in the midst of a similar number of educated people and that's a fact,let's not "whine" ourselves
4460 2018-12-15 21:45:50 And it is OK to support fossil fuels. In particular oil and natural gas are close to being the “perfect” fuels.
4461 2018-12-15 21:45:44 Quebecers are unprincipled lot when it comes to taking other people’s money. The greedy bastards don’t care where it comes from and dirty oil money is the best money of all especially  if other people worked their ass of to earn it.
4462 2018-12-15 21:45:40 Kiel oil brothers Columbus Indiana,Pence family environmental violaters look it up,make them pay.

4464 2018-12-15 21:45:20 I read on the bio oil. Too many fillers for me and mineral oil I have reactions to
4465 2018-12-15 21:45:09 Alex go chop all this oil and wonder why he can’t run on the park tomorrow
4466 2018-12-15 21:45:07 I came from MB 30 years ago right into the height of PET/NEP bashing and am still flummoxed all these years later. My first visit to church, the pastor prayed that God would give us back 'our' oil that Mr Trudeau had taken away from us. It was surreal.
4467 2018-12-15 21:44:58 Some one need to tell Mullas ,their oil is no big deal any more . !! Some one need to tell them they are finished.
4468 2018-12-15 21:44:49 Try putting some orange peels in the oil with it. I heard that's how people make the flavored ones.
4469 2018-12-15 21:44:47 for other states in that area to leverage support for the us as the middle east is oil rich. idk Exactly why lots of americans support israel but a part of it is the misbelief that it supports jewish communities (again thas blatantly wrong cos it works the other way round)
4470 2018-12-15 21:44:37 I know this fool 
4471 2018-12-15 21:44:31 warm olive oil mixed with Aussie or auntie Jackie’s makes my hair softer after being dry for long
4472 2018-12-15 21:44:27 So you not gonna mention that you needed a jump start to even get to the place for the oil change? 
4473 2018-12-15 21:44:27 Lunch: Bulletproof Green Tea and Dandelion Tea blend with Matcha, Cinnamon and Pink Salt. Salmon, Asparagus & Egg soup with Pink Salt, Black Pepper,  Turmeric, Cayenne, Paprika, Chia, Collagen Powder, Coconut Oil, Olive Oil & Butter poured over Cilantro and Mixed Greens.

4475 2018-12-15 21:44:01 You're being dramatic. If we fought for oil, why didn't we seize the war spoils? In any case, the USA is a net exporter now. We don't have the dependency on foreign supplies that we once had.
4476 2018-12-15 21:44:01 Oil consumption is actually projected to increase for the foreseeable future. Plus, please explain what 21st century conveniences you are prepared to sacrifice to live in a world without oil.
4477 2018-12-15 21:43:56 not oil, but all the others.
4478 2018-12-15 21:43:54 I don't think even the Jewish community can understand it. It's like applying hot oil to a burn. He hasn't fucked up this country enough, so he's doing it to another country as well. This will have very nasty consequences
4479 2018-12-15 21:43:48 Makes no sense when Alberta and Sask have oil.

4482 2018-12-15 21:43:38 Came for an oil change, I end up needing windshield washer fluid, a new filter, new wiper blades, one of my tires has a slow leak might as well tell me I need a new car 
4483 2018-12-15 21:43:29 What animal does MCT oil come from?
4484 2018-12-15 21:43:27 We are still accepting our Holiday Spice Drive donations until December, 17th!  We are looking for butter, flour, baking soda, baking powder, vegetable oil, and variety of spices. It would be greatly appreciated to consider dropping off your donations to 9 Straubel CT.
4485 2018-12-15 21:43:18 That was my thought exactly.everywhere we look we have "climate denial"&greed/stupidity.We have plastics,fracking&conflict for oil. As a boy I thought by2000 we would have a World Council for our planet.I thought hovercars,space travel&beautiful selfsufficient buildings,Dreamer
4486 2018-12-15 21:43:16 Oil spill
4487 2018-12-15 21:43:15 Gerry...So it's OK then to ship foreign Oil and destroy your own industry says the alternate economy man......
4488 2018-12-15 21:43:15 3/ in making sure that persons can come here illegally and stay. Trump poses a threat. These same people have oil and energy interests in Russia. Trump posed a threat to that as well. Senators and Congress lose their vast k come and benefits with term limits, Trump poses a threat

4490 2018-12-15 21:43:10 What a bunch of right wing malarkey; the oil issue, of getting it to market, is just as much a result of Harpers failures as it is of the current govt, which has at least taken it 2 the people #cdnpoli
4491 2018-12-15 21:43:07 Would be nice. Not sure how far big oil spreads its tendrils, but they need to be held accountable.

4496 2018-12-15 21:42:52 Not sure how to reconcile transfer payments to Quebec. $ from AB oil for which AB needs  pipeline is contribution to transfer payments.

4499 2018-12-15 21:42:19 Obama care was for more destructive in other ways than its few benefits like pre-existent conditions. The current law is a massive wealth redistribution under the cover of health car.  It’s a snake oil tonic nothing more.

4504 2018-12-15 21:41:22 Didnt realize they had major oil reserves and a vast land with small population in Northern hemisphere. Bad answer.
Apples and Oranges. If you dont have a Canadian solution....well...you know!
4505 2018-12-15 21:41:22 He’s trying to say that for 200 years playing through pain worked just fine and then these fancy doctors rolled in with their modern snake oil and suddenly “‘they risk permanent injury” and “ buy MRI’s!” Nonsense.
4506 2018-12-15 21:41:16 trying to get my oil changed again let's see if they ordered the filter like they said they would
4507 2018-12-15 21:41:14 It is insanely hard to find cbd oil without thc here in Edmonton
4508 2018-12-15 21:41:12 WWII torpedos ran on grain alcohol denatured w/ methanol. Sailors had various ways to remove it w/ mixed results. After enough sailors were blinded by methanol, they changed to denaturing w/ an oil that produced gastro cramps/violent evacuation. They had ways to remove that too.
4509 2018-12-15 21:41:08 Frizzy hair? Coconut oil.
No shaving cream? Coconut oil.
Dry skin? Coconut oil.
Bad credit? Coconut oil.
BF acting up? Coconut oil.
4510 2018-12-15 21:41:04 Rose hip oil is single handed the best thing I’ve put on my face my skin is fucking silk soft
4511 2018-12-15 21:41:04 I understand Economics. Competition isn't a cure all. Why did / do we have to bailout auto, insurance, & farm industries IF competition is so perfect? We also have #CorporateWelfare for nuclear power, oil & gas even though they make billions a yr in profits, & $4B to coal yr.
4512 2018-12-15 21:40:56 I agree with u on Flynn and @dsmann115 they just made a terrible vote after campaigning on taking the right vote. PG on the other hand is a snake oil salesman who puts his political finger in the wind and goes in that direction. He doesnt mean well 4 #Cincinnati just 4 himself.
4513 2018-12-15 21:40:45 I hate when people try to be slick as if I’m not baby oil 
4514 2018-12-15 21:40:42 It’s fake socialism. 

It’s a dictatorship. 

with all that money from oil there should be food and medicine for everybody if this were a true socialist society.  Think Scandinavia.

what’s going on is the sociopathic criminals at the top are stealing from everybody.
4515 2018-12-15 21:40:41 Yellow vests are in the news cycle, spreading and will get attention, whereas just another protest in same old boring ninja outfits is a big yawn.
4516 2018-12-15 21:40:39 Thanks for this. It’s a useful fact. So if we do like @BrianJeanAB demands and boycott Quebec, & they respond by buying all of their oil elsewhere, how much will Alberta lose? Another reason I won’t be boycotting any Canadian province.
4517 2018-12-15 21:40:38 Why are oil changes so expensive 
4518 2018-12-15 21:40:26 …ぐぅ
4519 2018-12-15 21:40:22 They also don’t cover other routine things like oil changes for government vehicles. Wiping phones that have no incriminating evidence is just standard procedure. Of course you don’t actually care about that.
4520 2018-12-15 21:40:19 Eastern Canada isn’t as used to be being bribed and corrupted by oil money. So building a pipeline (which will eventually leak) over lakes/rivers seems risky. And for what? To prop up a dying industry that we should be moving away from.
4521 2018-12-15 21:40:15 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4522 2018-12-15 21:40:15 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4523 2018-12-15 21:40:14 Developing nation's impact on the planet will increase, that's not  blame, it's stating a fact. They are copying  the west's model of consumerism and fossil fuel dependency. Other nations like Arab states will produce oil as long as there's a market.
4524 2018-12-15 21:40:13 I had to read it over.... Difficult for me in hausa..
4525 2018-12-15 21:40:11  that really dependson your perspective. The big bubble buster for the Poch Is a miracle worker philosophy is Leicester. He's doing a grand job against the oil merchants et al but still pales into insignificance compared to Ranieri @ Leicester.
4526 2018-12-15 21:40:09 So is chick-fil-a cooking their food in anointing oil or what??  #realquestions

4528 2018-12-15 21:40:07 Have you heard about our hearty All-Seeing Eye Essential Oil? It really boosts your enjoyment with its ancient many-angled one!
4529 2018-12-15 21:39:58 The behaviour has nothing to do with being "educated", if by that you mean literate. Apparently there is at least one otherwise well educated man who believes that you can "grab them by the pu$$y" ! Lack of consequence is the reason for abhorrent and antisocial behaviour.
4530 2018-12-15 21:39:52 Yay.  Can't wait.  Wonder which oil company exec you'll choose...
4531 2018-12-15 21:39:50 Oil price volatility – in three charts  di @FT
4532 2018-12-15 21:39:43 I’m really just posting whatever boring stuff comes to mind because I’m getting my nerve up to go get fuel oil.
4533 2018-12-15 21:39:36 The Liberals are broke and need revenue.  They are losing billions a year in oil and gas revenue, and already have payroll taxes over 50% for some people. They will tax anything and everything to get money.  Recession coming fast, and they are not prepared.
4534 2018-12-15 21:39:35 Lmao
You that was claiming you know how to talk.  
Oga carry your misogynistic self to yaba and meet your group

4536 2018-12-15 21:39:20 @exxonmobil  Your Chad/Cameroon Pipeleine has been operating in a legal void since 2003 because you have failed to provide an Area Specific Oil Spil lResponse Plan for the OSFST and the overland Pipelline
4537 2018-12-15 21:39:18 yes and now I am hungry. okay  gluten free piece of bread toasted in olive oil in a frying pan for me.
4538 2018-12-15 21:39:11 What’s in my purse? A mango, an avocado, a lime, some Florida water, rose oil, and and some lip gloss lmaoooo ion need to explain myself.
4539 2018-12-15 21:39:06 The Oil go on a hot streak, mostly due to hot goaltending & having the best player in the world... now some media want to forget how bad Chia has been at building the team around McD...I feel like I’m taking crazy pills!
4540 2018-12-15 21:38:47 Instead of being part of the problem and creating further divisions within the community, stop attacking and start presenting positive reasoning. Because the affordability argument is flawed if used on it’s own to excuse the use of palm oil.
4541 2018-12-15 21:38:32 Venezuela is an LEDC that is stripped down via cheap oil exploitation by the likes of MEDCs such as the US. You cannot ever compare it to the UK which is an MEDC itself and a lot of Lab policies like nationalising services are already in effect in other West European countries.
4542 2018-12-15 21:38:05 For soup, cook diced onion in oil, then simmer with chicken, cilantro, beef broth and peas. Top with sour cream.

4544 2018-12-15 21:38:02 He did what’s best for the US’ interest. Otherwise oil prices would skyrocket.
4545 2018-12-15 21:38:00 Yeah how funny how Trudeau sr. Put in mechanisms for Canadians to own the oil; every #conservative gvt, including provincial, has fought for the foreign corporations
4546 2018-12-15 21:37:18 I dont. I just cut them, coat them in oil and spices and cook
4547 2018-12-15 21:37:07 How about one of the CEOs  from the companies that engineered  the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ? BP or Transocean or Halliburton . Anybody recall a name ? The BP guy   was particularly  incompetent so he's perfect
4548 2018-12-15 21:37:03 For me it's almost all bean types. I suspect the hydrogenated vegetable oil makes it worse but not sure. All I know is that the mis of beans and chapo is guaranteed to give me acid all night long
4549 2018-12-15 21:36:56 @chigrl How many trades would you say you take on oil on an average day? Thanks!
4550 2018-12-15 21:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
4551 2018-12-15 21:36:39 You know what? Comprehension is your problem, get out of my mentions if you don't understand what I typed.
4552 2018-12-15 21:36:38 Quraafaadka Soomaalida waxaa ka mid ah, professore 710 maxaa loola jeedaa wuxuu yiri waa saliid(OIL) wadankeena ayay ka buuxdaa
4553 2018-12-15 21:36:33 QC gets vast majority of its oil from Alberta and U.S.
4554 2018-12-15 21:36:29 This picture looks like the teaser for a new Hallmark Christmas movie where the girl is trying to save her Christmas channel from the evil oil developer who in the end finds the true spirit of Christmas...
4555 2018-12-15 21:36:27 Typical world we live in...unless it involves OIL, no one gives a stuff! Where is the so called fucking called ‘United Nations’....send in the allied forces, remove the peasant fucking so called Generals and restore order. But no, there is no monetary gain for anyone. humanity!
4556 2018-12-15 21:36:26 @sarahzhang I don't see your article about ancients chewing tree sap tar as gum but wanted to add as kids living on the California coast where oil tar was often found on the beach, we chewed that tar like gum. Look at ancient human sites where oil is found.
4557 2018-12-15 21:36:16 It is not an addiction. And oil does not come from dinosaurs. Oil is the reason we have a civilization. That will never change.
4558 2018-12-15 21:36:10 You do realize that the $25 Billion in cash that gets sent from the US to Mexcio EVERY YEAR is more than the country gets from oil and amounts to 2% of their GDP...?
4559 2018-12-15 21:36:02 You should try fresh beets sautéed or broiled with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.  Canned beets of old do not represent beets.
4560 2018-12-15 21:36:00 regular humans: oil 

yeehaw people: oiyle
4561 2018-12-15 21:36:00 RETWEET if you  that oil exports are benefitting economies across the #USA!
4562 2018-12-15 21:36:00 also a question (that I don’t know if I’ll get an answer to) but does anyone have an oil diffuser?? and if so!! is it worth it and do u have recommendations 
4563 2018-12-15 21:35:52 @cbdhealth20 does 5% CBD oil show up on urine tests?
4564 2018-12-15 21:35:43 guys i’m: soft

4565 2018-12-15 21:35:26 I wish Josie Maran wasn’t so $$$ cause my skin is in NEED of that Argan Oil
4566 2018-12-15 21:35:24 I ain't cleaning it kelly you should see it!!I nearly cried!.GET TO FUCK OUT MY KITCHEN!!. Fat..oil stuff all over the cooker 
4567 2018-12-15 21:35:17 Maybe fried in olive oil and some season
4568 2018-12-15 21:35:13 I really like gun oil...
4569 2018-12-15 21:35:11 نعم والمسألة فيها تفصيل يا أخ فارس .
4570 2018-12-15 21:35:05 I think some big funds got caught on the wrong side. Look at $UGAZ. Makes no sense when dollar up and oil sliding.
4571 2018-12-15 21:35:04 I mean even the oil lobbyists see this and make the sucking-air-through-teeth noise.
4572 2018-12-15 21:34:56 And you justify that stinking behavior??
Like they represent the average Nigerian. It's sad you still somehow manage to put the blame on women in this kind of situation 
Sigh
4573 2018-12-15 21:34:49 Who knows? If she killed someone could be it? They've already tried to drag Beto for corporate oil when it was people who worked for the industry.
4574 2018-12-15 21:34:29 #CrazyQuestionsForAquaman  how did you feel about the b.p oil spill?
4575 2018-12-15 21:34:20 Exactly how are we better? No provincial trust funds, too low revenues w/ flat tax, non-diversified oil economy, underfunded schools & healthcare, struggling economy, minimal royalties negotiated by PC’s, but there are a lot of wealthy foreign investors. What’s better?
4576 2018-12-15 21:34:16 Ooo. I’m into it. I’ve heard rose hip oil is really good
4577 2018-12-15 21:34:12 Say that again when your grandkids are born. Then again, I'm sure the #ExxonPropaganda will have changed by then too. You realize that @exxonmobil Exxon knew about this since the 70's and used that info to protect their oil rigs and other infrastructure? But yea keep talking.
4578 2018-12-15 21:34:08 Special guest for our 11th episode... founder of Reichow Beard Oil Company... @Jake4Reichow !! Tune in later this week!
4579 2018-12-15 21:34:05 See get out of here if you don't have anything meaningful to say
4580 2018-12-15 21:33:55 One explanation is that they threw away their long-successful farming culture in favour of the get-rich-quick mindset. The oil industry took over all politics, finance, and culture in the province, leaving it vulnerable to the boom-and-bust roller coaster of global swings.
4581 2018-12-15 21:33:54 If there’s lots of stuck on food I use kosher salt combined with olive oil to clean and oil it up at the same time
4582 2018-12-15 21:33:41 Pray tell, you know this how? Evidence please. Didn’t Trump excoriate Merkel for dealing with Putin and advised her it was a mistake to engage in the purchase of natural gas an oil from him because it would empower him? Tell me how does Putin own Trump.
4583 2018-12-15 21:33:29 Warm SEA salt soaks for a 4 months. I don’t recommend using the tea tree oil jusso. Only use it if you develop a keloid. Or once in a while put a few drops in the sea salt solution
4584 2018-12-15 21:33:26 I think there's some botox there. Maybe he uses moisturizing oil, he never looks oily, but he always looks kind of waxy. Then there's his dead behind the eyes expression. Maybe this is just his DC, WH look where he knows he's in way over his head?
4585 2018-12-15 21:33:23 People are crazy, especially in a market place.
4586 2018-12-15 21:33:20 Funny, you haven’t mentioned the subsidies given to oil companies and ag.  Someone in your position should be smarter than this.
4587 2018-12-15 21:33:19 Veggie oil totally ok. Butter flavor shortening, I can't. My Jewish mother card would be revoked! But I really do use veggie oil in my latkes and I'm told they're amazing. Promise me no shortening!  Lol

4590 2018-12-15 21:32:57 Oil and Vinegar Atheism
4591 2018-12-15 21:32:49 Come and listen to a story ‘bout a man named Paul. A Nor’n Irelander, no longer bowled a cricket ball. And then one day he became a Prosper dude. And driving down the road he saw an oil rig pumping crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea.
4592 2018-12-15 21:32:34 I ate the second serving of my roasted root veggies from last night (cut/prepped last night, so I just had to mix oil/herbs/pepper + bake)
and now I am sad because I didn't make more
4593 2018-12-15 21:32:26 "You guardians are weird.. Why you use the oil from cabals..?"

Maybe he should leave the place, he probably told her that he isn't a guardian.

"we have killed some cabals under the bridge in the north but they could be some taken psions.If you see them just don't shoot them.."
4594 2018-12-15 21:32:24 The god of cryptic lore, he poured oil thereon.  #make
4595 2018-12-15 21:32:21 Argan oil. Anti age moisturiser as well so 2 in 1 basically
4596 2018-12-15 21:32:17 That is untrue. They have more care for us Americans than any Republican GOP ever has. All they care about is lining their pockets, wars for oil using our young American men and women. But you best believe they use our tax dollars to have good healthcare.
4597 2018-12-15 21:32:14 Oil and gas should pull all sponsorships everywhere until this pipeline is resolved.  Let green peace sponsor #Stars and the hospitals etc.  See how well that works out!!  Shut the tap off now!!  #YellowVestsCanada
4598 2018-12-15 21:32:09 Niggas always tryna get husband’d, but can’t cook, clean, build a house, fix shit around the house, change the oil or a tire, & damn sure can’t pay the bills. What do y’all bring to the table besides dick in some grey champions?
4599 2018-12-15 21:32:00 Mr. Burberry beard oil.
4600 2018-12-15 21:31:38 People who violently oppose PHEV (plugin hybrid cars) in favour of EVs (pure electric cars) are either delusional or want us to be dependent on oil forever.
4601 2018-12-15 21:31:35 Coal-fired industry in The USA would be only 40% in retrospect now; 60% preferred other environmentally friendly energy sources Sir!A lot on researches towards improvements of the methodology on extractions of vital constituents rawmaterials from fossil oil,should be welcomed.
4602 2018-12-15 21:31:22 People like you are the problem. Smh
4603 2018-12-15 21:31:19 this sounds more like what a bored texas oil family would name their 4th son
4604 2018-12-15 21:31:15 bless you  I’ll invest in some aloe vera. I tried putting some tea tree oil on it and it stung in what I think was a good way 
4605 2018-12-15 21:31:09 I use lemon oil, grapefruit oil mixed with water and alcohol to make a cleaning solution.. I also add peppermint oil mixed with some water in a spray bottle as a refresher to help me wake up
4606 2018-12-15 21:31:00 Feisty Olive Oil.

4608 2018-12-15 21:30:58 'Who in their right minds advocates to ignore the leak?'
-people in the drywall, cabinets, flooring and paint businesses
-people in the rain business.. but that's not yet a real thing, so swap 'rain' for 'oil'
-people who are not in their right minds!
-people hoping for THE Flood
4609 2018-12-15 21:30:52 You killed the season king of the pan man . Take some olive oil put it n pan ,use a paper towel and coat the entire inside then turn the pan on low and heat it just until it looks dry .take off burner leave it alone until cool .wipe pan out again. With a clean dry paper towel.
4610 2018-12-15 21:30:37 I'll have to take your word for all this. It's just that if we stopped using palm oil overnight I suspect the amount of CO2 going into the atmosphere would scarcely change. So whilst this may reduce the rate of CO2 buildup, we need radical measures to actually remove the stuff.
4611 2018-12-15 21:30:25 I got special olive oil for you and jay
4612 2018-12-15 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。

4618 2018-12-15 21:29:50 Yep but maintenance as well. Ive changed the oil & filters (1st time Ive done it. So messy)
The mechanic has taken part of the stern drives for repair. (??? $$$$). Ive cleaned whats left (lots of shells) Today Im going to antifoul the drives (blue) & hull (black). Big job
4619 2018-12-15 21:29:45 Olive Oil politics! Ha ha ha!
4620 2018-12-15 21:29:38 For dry skin, there are a lot of good facial oil. Hit sephora and get samples to try first.
4621 2018-12-15 21:29:31 Grapeseed oil helps prevent fine lines and wrinkles, caused by the loss of collagen and elastin.
4622 2018-12-15 21:29:30 Grapeseed oil maintains elastin and other connective tissue proteins that support organs, such as our skin.
4623 2018-12-15 21:29:28 He’s just trying to distance himself from the LNP, in the hopes of getting re-elected, another snake oil salesman
4624 2018-12-15 21:29:27 A bit hypocritical to call our oil industry dirty, not acknowledge the billions of dollars you’ve accepted from it and then buy your oil from Saudi Arabia.  Your hydro plants are great but you’re still burning oil! All we ask is you burn ours.
4625 2018-12-15 21:29:19 lmao
"This is Lagos"
What is that supposed to mean??
4626 2018-12-15 21:29:11 2/2 Alberta remembers the NEP when their oil was sold below market rates for the benefit of Ontario. Why would they expect BC to happily accept the risks for the benefit of others? If there is a spill who will pay to clean it up? There are ways to address these concerns
4627 2018-12-15 21:29:05 Is there any need for something the world knows about ?
4628 2018-12-15 21:29:03 @IMOHQ   The Komi Kribi 1 OSFST became obsolete in Jan 2015 because it is a single hull tanker. Why are the IMO turning a blind eye  to this 2.5 million barells capacity tanker operating in a legl void without a Area Specific Oil Spill response plan

4635 2018-12-15 21:28:06 Quebec gets 80% of its oil from Canada and the US.

But don't let facts get in the way of your whiny victim narrative.
4636 2018-12-15 21:27:44 Who needs a Dad to yell atcha to get an oil change when you got a fiancé that does it every. Single. Time. He gets in your car. 
4637 2018-12-15 21:27:40 Trabaho sako kay para naa koy pang exchange gift. Pwede man kaya baby oil pud? Haha
4638 2018-12-15 21:27:37 My dad is spoiling my kids even little miss Ava and she’s not with us. I looked and said what about me he said I saved your life by doing your damn oil change. No dad buy me some sneakers as well
4639 2018-12-15 21:27:35 Govt will “focus group test” any big ET disclosure at places like @Battelle and @RANDCorporation IMHO, IF govt has known of ETs for some time and plans to disclose. 

If govt doesn’t know all that much re ETs/UFOs, then Lazar and many others have been peddling snake oil.
4640 2018-12-15 21:27:28 My parents taught me almost none of that stuff. I learned cooking from home ec, oil & basic car/house maint. from friends (well into my 20s), budgeting from necessity & stints with poverty, and laundry from Mom screaming "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?!"
4641 2018-12-15 21:27:23 Well, Zinke p*ssed me off regularly, and I don’t think he was doing it right (unless “it” = pimping out public lands for the benefit of oil barons & using our tax  to aggrandize himself. He was expert level at that).

4643 2018-12-15 21:27:14 i got an oil change today.
i got my septum ring back today.
i got a car wash.
filled my tank. 
now i’m relaxing with a fucking face mask.
4644 2018-12-15 21:27:10 Now I see why I schedule my oil changes first thing in the morning....had an appt at 11:30 and left at 1:45 WTF
4645 2018-12-15 21:26:31 We will need this oil for many many years to come and I'd rather use Canadian oil and not have it imported from Saudi Arabia. The very device you used for brushing your teeth the first thing you did in the morning used oil.
4646 2018-12-15 21:26:29 My dog Harvey told me he is going to call animal services if I don’t give him a bath today.  

Btw, emu oil shampoo is great for dog’s skin and it doesn’t irritate   near their eyes or nose.  
4647 2018-12-15 21:26:15 You can also use 100% essential oils on the body as long as they are diluted in a carrier oil like almond or grape seed or avocado.  I like to use peppermint oil n tea tree oil mixed in jojoba oil on my scalp

Fuck nigeria
4652 2018-12-15 21:25:38 You can see the difference it makes when it goes away & sales go down. It has happened in other countries. Fact is, money always a factor. I'd rather they cut oil subsidies or tax carbon, but I'll settle for this. Lots of other subisides higher on the list to cut (corn ethanol).
4653 2018-12-15 21:25:35 There is an alternative to palm oil, but I think it's a bit more expensive. There is no such thing as "sustainable" palm oil. And so, I have had to stop buying Nutella (and some other things).
4654 2018-12-15 21:25:29 So he can lose?  Beto wants to tax barrels of oil. This tax will be paid by taxpayers. The tax he proposes will make a gallon of gas $7-$8 per gallon. Can you afford to fill up your car at that price? $140-$160 to fill up a 20 gallon tank.
4655 2018-12-15 21:25:29 Obviously. I didn’t know cars needed oil until a few months after I bought my first car and I blew up the engine. I never thought to check the oil. And I ended up driving it until it ran out of oil, and continued until the engine seized up or whatever and blew up.

4658 2018-12-15 21:25:07 My comment was meant as a rebuttal to the suggestion that the impact of the pipeline would be acceptable because it would only marginally increase oil tanker traffic. 
As a staunch advocate for clean, renewable energy sources, I protest all oil tankers and pipelines everywhere.

4666 2018-12-15 21:24:42 The reality is they know that too. It's not just fuel that comes from oil. It's the spin off chemicals that have made life easy for us

4671 2018-12-15 21:24:22 The weakening of Venezuela's oil profits can be laid to its subsidies & a more competitive market. Yes Venezuela isn't Communist, yet. However, it has some of its ugly features such as worship of a dead leader.
4672 2018-12-15 21:24:11 Oil of Oregano is as powerful as opium drugs WITHOUT drugging you. I use it for my broken shoulder from 2004 when USA gov broke it to shut me up. It works in minutes & lasts for hrs. Pain-management or antibiotic available in NATURAL Health stores & online like Amazon
4673 2018-12-15 21:24:11 Why do we need more oil? Didn't they just find literally one of the largest deposits ever in Texas?

This is just corporate lobbyist money in effect. A shortsighted decision purely motivated by profit, with no regards of the consequences.
4674 2018-12-15 21:24:07 Funny thing. This same guy I know who donated to Beto, donated to Bernie in 2016. Does that mean that Bernie took money from oil and gas lobbyists too? Because with your logic it does.
4675 2018-12-15 21:23:43 It’s not what’s causing more oil consumption- it’s SUVs & trucks

4680 2018-12-15 21:23:10 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
4681 2018-12-15 21:23:07 I'm not saying it's the best way to get there, but oil subsidies weren't going to be cut and carbon wasn't going to be taxed in this political climate...

4683 2018-12-15 21:23:01 One of the main reasons we have immigration law.  To keep large numbers of people from sweeping in like hordes of locusts and then moving on after they have depleted resources.

4691 2018-12-15 21:21:58 Yeah... you don’t want the soil... just the oil that’s beneath it
4692 2018-12-15 21:21:50 Did You see the video of people scooping groundnut oil from the gutter?
4693 2018-12-15 21:21:33 Any time you donate to a candidate or political party you have to list your employer. If you work in oil and gas, you have to disclose that. All of the money that you claim Beto took from oil and gas us actually from individual, hard working people who work in that field.
4694 2018-12-15 21:21:31 Bottom line is that those individual donors in oil and gas industry were backing a progressive Democrat. Why is that not  a positive thing? Oil companies worldwide are investing billions in shifting to renewable energies.

4700 2018-12-15 21:20:43 And by better, you mean spending the last 2 years opening up federal lands for oil drilling, rolling back regulations on car fuel efficiency standards, doing away with rules requiring companies to not dump waste into waterways. Stuff, like that, right? That's us doing better?

4706 2018-12-15 21:19:57 What are you even talking about? Do you know what an individual contribution is? I know someone who works in oil and gas here in East Texas. He donated to Beto. He has to put his employer on the thing when he donates. You can’t seriously think that’s taking PAC money.
4707 2018-12-15 21:19:57 I'm sorry, Saudi lives in the "dark"?

No.

If anything, KSA is one of the few countries that are trying to bring back the light in the Middle East, while Europe and your Congress are trying to figure out how much oil they can take from it.

But I don't blame you, for Fake media.
4708 2018-12-15 21:19:52 So... once we "got into the middle east" why did we not take all of their oil?  I mean if that was the reason, why don't we still have military control over their oil fields and tanker after US flagged tanker being filled and enroute to America?
4709 2018-12-15 21:19:32 So Formula E has its first race  in Saudi Arabia. On one side clean energy. On the other side dismembed journalist  dissolved in an oil barrel.
4710 2018-12-15 21:19:31 I love the city because it's always busy... Also the oil and gas sector interests me
4711 2018-12-15 21:19:11 Let me fix that , you mean US led occupation forces. More proof of stealing oil. The coalition is in grave danger, from within, nobody believes they are fighting Islamic State.
4712 2018-12-15 21:19:07 To America, Alberta is just Iraq (or anywhere with oil) without a military.. why the hell would they want to spend tax dollars when they could go in and take what they want. Especially if Alberta isn’t apart of the Canadian federation.. they’d be a tiny country with a lot of oil.

4723 2018-12-15 21:18:04 Of course , he looks like the objective is to leap out , I don't mind accidentally spilling a little crude oil he loves so much on the ledge .
4724 2018-12-15 21:17:56 Wow.  Donald Trump wins Presidential election 2016.  A crooked and stupid snake oil real estate salesman and it’s taking almost 2 years before his base begins to wake up
4725 2018-12-15 21:17:24 Already read that article... It does not discredit Beto as a progressive candidate, further shows he does not take corporate money. He was fighting for Texas, which relies on oil production and oil workers for it's vitality.

4730 2018-12-15 21:16:47 It's the Venezuelan version of US Resistance Movement, following int'l market factors affecting oil production, which has led to the present disaster.Communist, more than socialist leadership, is perhaps responsible.

4733 2018-12-15 21:16:31 Mostly agreed - I  encourage CAM as long as its safe, doesn’t crowd out proven therapy, and doesn’t break the bank. I do question whether our government should be paying for therapy w/out proven benefit over placebo. Why not tarot cards, astrology, or (literally) snake oil?

I’m sorry your situation is difficult. Blaming me or others for your misfortune is not going to change it though. I had nothing to do with decisions that put you in a financial bind, Nor did Libs or NDP
4747 2018-12-15 21:14:52 Whistler draws ire of oil industry with climate request: Oil industry insiders in Alberta are not at all impressed with… @environmentguru
4748 2018-12-15 21:14:50 Put a bowl of hot water in his room with olbas oil In it. Always do it for lacey and it helps.
Wishing him a speedy recovery xx
4749 2018-12-15 21:14:46  Use lavender essential oil as many people love feeling a walk
4750 2018-12-15 21:14:40 False. He brought his car into my shop for an oil change.
4751 2018-12-15 21:14:36 Nah I use the lil olive oil one 
4752 2018-12-15 21:14:35 No not entitled to it anymore our house runs on oil so no boiler or hot water the oil is 280 quid no chance of getting that before xmas .
4753 2018-12-15 21:14:26 This isn’t a BC opinion or sentiment. We refine and use Alberta oil here. It’s opinion from someone that obviously hasn’t thought through their actions or comments let alone consequences. Canada has enough challenges without creating more in my opinion by fighting among ourselves
4754 2018-12-15 21:14:09 And oil & gas industry makes sure that our voices are silenced?
 
That ended 11/6/18. Hear us roar.

4756 2018-12-15 21:13:50 I do like Ryan Zinke is out of the SOI position. That man was so sickening with his lies about being a geologist and trying to sell our public lands to oil companies. – bij In-N-Out Burger
4757 2018-12-15 21:13:48 @fagstein says:
... Quebec gets more than 80% of its oil from Canada and the United States, thanks largely to the Enbridge Line 9 pipeline, and that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Angola and Azerbaijan are not significant sources of oil in Quebec, according to the National Energy Board.

4759 2018-12-15 21:13:26 I also used to work for BP & am glad that they continue to be a pro-active company supplying energy to meet the needs of the world. Renewables are no cleaner(& less dependable)  & until we have sufficient nuclear, we still need oil & gas.

4765 2018-12-15 21:12:35 When no one noticed you and don't care either but act like they care when someone outside asks 
4766 2018-12-15 21:12:32 Trumps accomplishments (continued) named Ryan Zinke secretary of the interior whom has dismantled environmental protections that will be felt negatively for decades.   Named Rick Perry secretary of energy (does Perry remember?) and succumbed to oil companies
4767 2018-12-15 21:12:27 Unlike decades old oil subsidies which never end.
4768 2018-12-15 21:12:23 Sliced spam stewed with bacon mince. Toast baguette with olive oil and minced green onions. Serve immediately.
4769 2018-12-15 21:12:10 @GreenpeaceNZ  well we are going nowhere continually using oil.  Upsets the whole economies as Arabs want more money!!!
4770 2018-12-15 21:12:06 There was no "public service." You chose to serve big oil & the wealthy. You screwed over Native people (again) and yours is a legacy of climate change denial & destruction. The government stole our land. That is your legacy.

4771 2018-12-15 21:12:02 It’s not just about EVs. It’s about stoping the WAR for OIL!!!!!! Once people realize that they can get better transportation options with EVs and that they don’t have to give up theirs standard of living they will flock to EVs.
4772 2018-12-15 21:12:02 Beto's economic policies are classic bipartisan free trade. He cares more about the environment than any R, but I he's not serious about standing up to the fossil fuel industry. Part of his success was siphoning the big oil, pro business crowd that doesn't trust Cruz as a person.
4773 2018-12-15 21:11:51 procrastination level; expert: “I have to take a break from studying to oil my cutting board”
4774 2018-12-15 21:11:41 My car is getting an oil change and some other work done & I miss it so so much  being carless is poop
4775 2018-12-15 21:11:37 Educated man, imagine you're sexually harrased. You  peacefully protest against your harassment.
Then you are told to its not the best, Go to your harrasers,  share leaflets and be civil and win their hearts and hope some of them will change. 
But some of us didnt go to schools
4776 2018-12-15 21:11:30 Private companies exploiting oil fields may issue bonds based on estimated reserves but that's different.
4777 2018-12-15 21:11:25 Just got a fuckin oil stain on my tackma jacket!!! 
4778 2018-12-15 21:11:14 OBI: Oil gives you 80% of foreign exchange earnings.

CHECKED: Point valid, figures near accurate. As at 2017 NBS figures showed that Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings from oil the oil sector stood above 90%
4779 2018-12-15 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: day-old crust with fresh motor oil and cheese.
4780 2018-12-15 21:11:03 I’d try ditching shampoo for 90% of the time. Also, maybe try the oil along all of the hair - maybe about the same amount you use on the end, but distributed across the whole head.
4781 2018-12-15 21:11:01 
Everywhere oil on her body
4782 2018-12-15 21:11:00 On the old timber boat we use to have that got motor oil stains if we put it in the sun it would draw the oil up, then used the kitty litter/saw dust then used solvent and decreaser too. Took a few weeks of both drawing it out and solvent before we could repaint.
4783 2018-12-15 21:10:50 Putting CNG in cars was the need of the hour at that time cheapest fuel to save the depleted foreign exchange reserves 500million some said 1 billion$ reserves at that time also IPP were switched to gas from furnace oil at the same time govt. exploited gas reserves at that time.
4784 2018-12-15 21:10:47 Today's special at Wasota Vegan Paradise is oil free potatoes porridge with choice of 2 vegetables for $8.00
Also available in oil.
4785 2018-12-15 21:10:46 I love lemongrass.I got carried away spraying mosquito repellent cos it has lemongrass oil. Now the smell is overwhelming, I feel nauseous.
4786 2018-12-15 21:10:43 Of course I wait til my car sounds like a dying tyrannosaurus to get an oil change. Why am I like this?
4787 2018-12-15 21:10:42 Bullshit. Stop buying their Oil. That is what is needed
4788 2018-12-15 21:10:30 Yeah, but it was funny! I'm a straight oil-and-vinegar guy.
4789 2018-12-15 21:10:19 Lol nah those ones are naughty. Get peppermint oil. Add 15 drops of peppermint oil to water in a bottle and spray around the corners were the creepy crawlies chill

4793 2018-12-15 21:09:50 No chance of a nuclear war because all the rich Russian oil billionaires live in London you have been invaded by stealth and money . Greed and tories tell you bogie man stories.
4794 2018-12-15 21:09:48 Let me tell y’all tea tree oil works wonders
4795 2018-12-15 21:09:41 Interesting someone this intelligent would fall into the ideology. What's more frightening is individuals with this level of understanding of it, working to further it.
4796 2018-12-15 21:09:41 The problem is not "human psychology." Corporations have huge investment in oil. Not in the asteroid. In fact they would make money building the anti-asteroid technology.
4797 2018-12-15 21:09:41 At the oil changer cuz I gotta keep oil in the car so my engine don’t blow I’m good for that 
4798 2018-12-15 21:09:37 Walmart has had my car since 1. It’s 4  all I need is an oil change, Lord. 
4799 2018-12-15 21:09:31 Lol my lashes coming off. I had too much oil on my face soo don’t come for me. I was just being press bc I’m sitting in tf house

4801 2018-12-15 21:09:11 Just put clean oil in @AdvanceAuto with seafoam additive..exchanged starter fluid for throttle body cleaner when returning previous leaking caliper core reimbursement which I might use to clean MassAirFlow sensor even though driving pretty well regardless.#ThankyouForYourService
4802 2018-12-15 21:09:08 best moisturiser ive ever used is dermalogica? it’s expensive tho so get it on sale if u can + it smells like red lemonade. but also if u have dry skin, non comodegenic oil based moisturisers might work better, idk of any though? simple do one but ive never find simple effective

4804 2018-12-15 21:08:41 A Viper taking out an oil field with 763 Aim-9s is 117% realistic and the only reason I joined the AF. #longlivechappy
4805 2018-12-15 21:08:32 Enough of blaming others for the problems that have been caused by decades of mismanagement by the Conservatives. Pretty obvious that an oil based economy controlled by the oil industry a bad idea for people and the environment. Time to create the diverse economy of the future.
4806 2018-12-15 21:08:25 Mmm, might have to rub some coconut oil on that belly and rub to get you eating more!
4807 2018-12-15 21:08:15 Ha! At midday, I left the house to do 4.5hrs work. I’ve come home at 10pm with a Christmas tree, an oil on canvas painting, a vibrator, a bumbag, a tooth gem and 4 gluhwein in my stomach. IMPRESSIVE!
4808 2018-12-15 21:08:02 Means ending a cartel and getting competitive oil prices.

4812 2018-12-15 21:07:23 Obama 1.0 wasn't so great if you happen to live on top of "our" oil in the M.E.
4813 2018-12-15 21:07:19 Britain is not going to get another windfall like North sea oil that paid for our parents' generous pensions (and screwed the environment ) That's why 'they' want to escape the EU so they can sell off unprofitable agricultural land for fracking.
4814 2018-12-15 21:07:11 No no your absolutely right, City spend the most money so obviously they’ll win it. Liverpool might as well not bother chasing City. We all might as well just not bother because the glazers won’t match the Arab oil barrens so why fucking bother 
4815 2018-12-15 21:07:09 Presidents don't control foreign policy, the Pentagon and the CIA controlls foreign policy for the likes of ziocon bankers, oil and gas cartels and the Military industry... all of their wars are about destroying others to feed their personal greed...
4816 2018-12-15 21:07:01 Que bueno. El cbd oil o aceite de cannabis ayuda a muchas enfermedades.
4817 2018-12-15 21:06:56 You can try to get your hands on some clove oil at Whole Foods until you can get to a dentist.
4818 2018-12-15 21:06:38 I don’t owe you or anyone an explanation for my situation, income or choices. But I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you’re desperation is speaking.

I have family, friends & neighbours who are greatly affected by the oil glut and recession. Since I help them, I am too.
4819 2018-12-15 21:06:36 People around the world must be scratching their heads, it’s not every day you see a government sabotaging industries like oil and gas. You have to be some kind of special to do that.
4820 2018-12-15 21:06:33 Then explain the prevalent high rate of divorce in Muslim northern Nigeria communities (AREWA).
4821 2018-12-15 21:06:29 Art, is it possible to trade Canadian oil directly  (other than  using Canadian oil stocks)?
4822 2018-12-15 21:06:25 Respect my right to opinion, don't come to my Tl to dictate what to do and not to me, now leave here if you don't want to be unfortunate.
4823 2018-12-15 21:06:25 He was bought by oil companies, he did “serve” his country. Are you @realDonaldTrump the only one who doesn’t see the connection? Are your advisors faking the truth?
4824 2018-12-15 21:06:09 after they kill any hope for affordable healthcare & they cause poor ppl to succumb to illnesses, id like to know who they'll have fight their wars for oil? They gonna outsource? To whom? The Russians?
4825 2018-12-15 21:05:57 You think a non deep state actor would overlook a killing by Saudi to keep oil flowing? I mean deep state tactics are to overlook things as long as money keeps flowing.
4826 2018-12-15 21:05:49 Can't we all just get along, the Oil is winning games finally and last I check we are actually in a playoff spot.    So its 10 Lords a leaping today... enjoy and have some eggnog!!

4830 2018-12-15 21:05:29 The critic factor with gilts is the confidence they will be repaid and serviced and is not based on oil reserves..of course the long term prospects of the economy as a whole which includes oil is factored into the interest rate. For the UK as a whole oil is dwarfed by services...
4831 2018-12-15 21:05:24 Están haciendo un bocinazo y pasaron por el frente de mi casa, lo que me hizo pensar "¿por qué en vez de gastar plata en nafta/gas/gas oil para hinchar las bolas así no la juntan entre todos y la donan para hacer algo bueno?"

4842 2018-12-15 21:04:33 grape seed oil contains a high amount of linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid, which is really good for oily skin.
4843 2018-12-15 21:04:33 grapeseed oil is a natural anti-inflammatory and can help clear acne.
4844 2018-12-15 21:04:24 The way the weathers been in the north 2day, I'm feeling VERY lucky.
I have a roof.
I have no oil 4 heating, elec till Mon(if I use economically).
I have a few tins from f/bank left.

4845 2018-12-15 21:04:07 
4846 2018-12-15 21:04:06 I missed it was getting my oil changed.  I can pretty much guess...
4847 2018-12-15 21:04:05 Actually gas from Russia accounts for 40% of European consumption and oil for 30% so dependency is bigger on gas via pipelines (Eurostat)
4848 2018-12-15 21:03:53 @Mazarine_Sky_ what about me
4849 2018-12-15 21:03:35 I believe so. There are lies everywhere, censorship.. but the criminal infrastructure is here and we can see who is in charge, they keep changing and blaming others but banking system, oil companies and all others are under control of the same criminal element.
4850 2018-12-15 21:03:27 Would it be too much to ask that you replace Zinke with someone who will not rob and pilage our treasury and land...by the way, the land you are "auctioning" off, does not belong to you. We don't need more oil, we need clean energy, why don't you try to do something good.
4851 2018-12-15 21:03:23 Potatoes deep fried in hydrogenated oil should be number one on your AVOID list. Health is wealth

4855 2018-12-15 21:02:47 Valvoline be taxin on the oil change geeee
4856 2018-12-15 21:02:31 Put simply, the zionists do not need the SAUDI's and will probably kill them in a hostile take over because their oil industry is finishing and the USA need a military strategic position to attack Iran, next
4857 2018-12-15 21:02:14 Excellent idea, but never forget that Norway exports it's pollution...oil.
4858 2018-12-15 21:01:52 The economy is bad so u can't really blame them
4859 2018-12-15 21:01:46 He really is a snake oil salesman. He hasn’t mentioned the 10% increase 4 the middle-class since the midterms. He was full of crapola then & full of crapola now.

The Gullible can continue 2 believe him & believe he’s God’s  Gift.  I know better.  

Donny Dirty Deeds is a LIAR!
4860 2018-12-15 21:01:28 I'm not denying the climate is changing. Its has always changed, and will always change. The question is human influence. That I'm skeptical about. When there is so much money involved, just like the tobacco industry, oil industry etc, it's healthy being skeptical.

4866 2018-12-15 21:01:02 They're latkes. They're already fried in peanut oil. The healthy ship sailed and sank thousands of years ago! Plus, gotta have them with applesauce and sour cream. Some foods you only eat once or twice a year. Do it up right!
4867 2018-12-15 21:01:01 There are no safer pesticides than round up.

Clove oil, vinegar, rotenone, copper sulphate: all far more toxic than round up.

Natural does not mean safe.

4869 2018-12-15 21:00:35 Just a suggestion considering the style of this drawing I would love to see this coloured in an old anime pallet. You know with not exactly vibrant and poignet colours , maybe a bit washed out or looking a bit like oil paint. Anyways lovely drawing as usual.

4872 2018-12-15 21:00:13 Poppy seeds have a sweet, nutty flavor and are used as flavoring in breads, rolls, and cakes. They are also used to make poppy seed oil, which is used in cooking, artist's colors and soap.

4876 2018-12-15 20:59:22 I brush mine after I wash it and put a pantene leave in repair oil through it and let it air dry over night. I somehow always wake up with nice, non frizzy curls in the morning

4879 2018-12-15 20:59:06 This is how you know the US is corrupt. Giving a war criminal a human rights award? How about the people in Libya? Or the illegal bombing of Syria for an oil pipeline for Israel? SMH disgusting.
4880 2018-12-15 20:58:50 Yes im sat at home with no heating amd a 1 year old its freezing  just cant afford the oil to run my heating ...disgracefull 
4881 2018-12-15 20:58:39 Getting this oil change is taking wild long
4882 2018-12-15 20:58:11 Looks like things are not going to get better for the national parks until ppl wake up & stop the mining/oil drilling b/4 the land is contaminated & air polluted
4883 2018-12-15 20:58:07 Labour has a good platform and Trump's platform includes a border wall and "taking the oil." It's not even close unless you just compare personality politics which even then I dont see.
4884 2018-12-15 20:57:57 @jkenney Build a port in Sarnia, buy as many oil tankers as needed, ship to NB, right up the St Lawrence, past Mtl! Wouldn’t you love to do that! I’d love to see the look on their faces as all those tankers go sailing by!
4885 2018-12-15 20:57:53 I was around the last time this sentiment was gaining traction during NEP. At that time with the oil revenue Alta would've been 4th richest country per capita. Didn't make sense then.  Makes even less sense now with current resource revenues.
4886 2018-12-15 20:57:52 Gone home but you want to chickpeas and oil
Gone Hummus
4887 2018-12-15 20:57:43 Great for the sinuses.. I mix some of it with lavender oil and peppermint oil in my diffuser at night. Amazing
4888 2018-12-15 20:56:49 Not everyone went to standard schools. Some don't even go to class maybe he's one of them. U never said anything against them fighting against immorality. Just that their method is not the best but someone somewhere has poor interpretation skills.
4889 2018-12-15 20:56:43 Tired of the snake oil boat rower!  They want something to really cheer about.
4890 2018-12-15 20:56:20 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza
Braised Beef Short Rib, Red Onion Marmalade, Bleu Cheese, Mozzarella, & Olive Oil…$12.50
4891 2018-12-15 20:56:00 Honestly a month..but every time I do, I make sure to deep condition it with avocado, honey, egg, mayo, coconut milk, olive oil, bananas (all mixed together) I’m telling you food does a lot more for your hair then a lot of these products
4892 2018-12-15 20:55:48 "Buffet to buy GE for 200B all cash offer".
"BABA to pay 20usd a share dividend on dec 25, funded by alipay profits"
"China to buy 10B barrels of oil at 120$ from Russia"
"Trump retires and said all of this was "a joke""
4893 2018-12-15 20:55:25 #InteriorSecZinke just resigned: FFS Please replace him with someone who works for public lands, NOT BIG OIL . 
I'm sure #GOPCorruption & #IndividualOne won't 
4894 2018-12-15 20:55:23 This is how I feel about Sunday Riley Luna sleeping oil and Good Genes.......I did not want them to make my skin look so good
4895 2018-12-15 20:55:06 No palm oil 
4896 2018-12-15 20:55:02 Kratom makes my head and ears itch. It's annoying. but it does help with the pain and anxiety. Can't get the good stuff here like your THC oil. I forgot what it is called.

4898 2018-12-15 20:55:00 Okay week 3 olive oil breast massage works tremendously on perkiness and firmness
4899 2018-12-15 20:54:53 If you know anyone that studied Biochemistry and graduated from a Nigerian University with a Second class and above who is willing to work in an oil company with a salary of #150,000. Please help me ask where he/she did his/her SIWES
4900 2018-12-15 20:54:44 I agree that BIG OIL should diversify. Coal gasification is the future along with gasification plants for municipal garbage elimination. 5000 Centigrade works wonders for toxic waste.
4901 2018-12-15 20:54:42 Or be used to create the 100s of other products that rely on oil?
4902 2018-12-15 20:54:31 This eucalyptus oil >>>>
4903 2018-12-15 20:54:20 @ems_jon don't mind this one. Him just Wan talk.
4904 2018-12-15 20:54:08 I actally was able to do this for something before but finding the root of this oil leak is super involved and I dont have half the tools needed :(((
4905 2018-12-15 20:54:07 As an Ontarian living in Alberta for the past 10 years, I am convinced we should let them separate. Everyone here has nothing but disdain for the rest of the union. The racism is unhinged. Oil is crashing, climate change will hurt crops. If they think they’re better alone.. 
4906 2018-12-15 20:54:01 I’m not doing shit else today but getting an oil change done.
4907 2018-12-15 20:53:57  repeatedly voted to gut protections for endangered species

4908 2018-12-15 20:53:48 Best way to get rid of weed smell is oil diffusers trust me
4909 2018-12-15 20:53:46 Nobody said they shouldn't go to the market place, we said they should sensitize them and engage them in the most possible civil manner, now what has the approach they took yielded?
4910 2018-12-15 20:53:38 So “real peppermint oil” right before taking the tablet (bear in mind the patient can’t swallow it )
4911 2018-12-15 20:53:33 Quebec wasn't going to benefit from EE. The pipeline was going to pass through. However, the two refineries in QC are receiving western oil thanks to the Line 9 reversal. As soon as Keystone was given the go-ahead by Trump, EE was off the table.
4912 2018-12-15 20:53:14 Does car insurance cover oil changes and annual tune-ups? 

No because then it would be so expensive no one could afford it.
4913 2018-12-15 20:53:13 So people think this attraction oil they use to make men like them so they get money from them ,is not jazz? Lmao and the waist beads and one thread tied to a stick for bonding are all not shirk? Wow it's being sold openly now ba sai anje wajen boka ba
4914 2018-12-15 20:53:06 Whole flax seeds contain both the fiber + oil, giving you all the nutritional value in one. Add 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to a Green Smoothie!
4915 2018-12-15 20:53:01 It really testifies to the cultural isolation & cynicism being sold to rural or religious voters as @gop policy

It also highlights the craven duplicity of those snake oil individualists who realized yelling loudly can drown out the Truth long enough to profit & destroy it all.
4916 2018-12-15 20:52:58 Purebread or Savary Island. Can’t live without that salted olive oil bread there.
4917 2018-12-15 20:52:52 Returning Crimea against the will of 97% of its population not enough. What is: all oil industry is privatised to international corporations. Putin put in prison. New President takes CIA appointed advisors like Yeltsin. Russia buys American weapons, dismantles own defense indstr
4918 2018-12-15 20:52:44 this might sound gross but leaving mayonnaise and eggs on your hair for an hour or two then wash it out, if you cant stand the smell look for deep conditioners that have argan oil in them
4919 2018-12-15 20:52:08 “Zinke’s decisions helped make the US the world’s leading producer of oil.” No doubt they helped, but this language implies significant influence over a process mostly driven by market forces and fracking technology. I like your work in general. Thank you for it! @shannonvansant
4920 2018-12-15 20:52:02 The movement is for anyone to support senators, house members, pres candidates but I don't see any point in arguing if you think a guy who's taken 2nd most oil money in congress is going to save the environment good luck
4921 2018-12-15 20:52:02 @TochiOfficial_ now look at this type of people just imagine, tell me why thunder won't fire this one.
People can't comprehend simple stuffs.
4922 2018-12-15 20:52:00 I hope so. He gambled and got lucky with 19. Gamblers can be easily bluffed and Chia’s track record is shit. The Oil need a GM who can make educated decisions. That’s not him. 

This Jones article and what BN said is worrisome though.
4923 2018-12-15 20:51:38 Recently on a flight across the country I got stuck next to a trump supporter from North Dakota who was complaining about how many wind turbines they were building. I had to explain to him that the oil industry actually makes money building wind farms.
4924 2018-12-15 20:51:36 The tag alone explains the motive of the protest, where should they have protested if not market, where the failure of bad parenting lays in abundance
4925 2018-12-15 20:51:29 Olive Oil And Red Wine Vinegar Didn't Go To College
4926 2018-12-15 20:51:18 Clearly you know nothing about international air travel. How does anyone fly from London to Moscow without flying over the airspace of a dozen sovereign countries? BC will still get oil from Alberta because Alberta has to sell it to someone close. Alberta has little leverage.
4927 2018-12-15 20:51:18 Trog oil
4928 2018-12-15 20:51:08 You don't report. How could you report about the TRUE situation, being FAR AWAY fm here ? So, refrain from commenting. You just pour oil on the flame. But maybe it's what you're looking for, with your far-left ideology. We don't give a shit about fascits from left & right, here.
4929 2018-12-15 20:51:04 But how u gone be in a real and oil spill around the corner 
4930 2018-12-15 20:50:55 I need to order linseed oil and gamsol on Amazon you know what might as well buy the album too

4932 2018-12-15 20:50:49 3) palm oilbased biofuels actually have three times the climate impact of traditional fossil fuels. Palm oil is not only bad for the climate: As their forest habitat, cleared, endangered species, the orangutan, Borneo elephant, Sumatran tiger are being pushed closer to extinction
4933 2018-12-15 20:50:28 Abi. Basically the same approach both parties are using
4934 2018-12-15 20:50:20 The promise that EE would serve refineries in ON and QC was a pipe dream because those refineries would not spend billions on coking units in favour of more profitable foreign (lighter) oil. Oil companies make business decisions not patriotic ones, even in AB.
4935 2018-12-15 20:50:17 I'm actually feeling art positive after like 10 years, and I might go back into oil painting and it really excites me.

4938 2018-12-15 20:50:02 Wellll, not so fast, John. I love your work, really, but, the LA Times did a piece over 10 years ago showing that Brown secretly gave a pass to oil/fracking companies and did not raise their tax level from the 50's? Not sure of specifics, but, he did not tax the rich who fund him
4939 2018-12-15 20:49:58 Who wanna wash my face and tone it and oil it. I promise I'll be still and cooperative

4942 2018-12-15 20:49:41 The theft of 3 trillion dollars of Iraqi oil, converting it into gold,
is the most dangerous thing to happen to the U.S.A since
Dec. 7, 1941. 
Bush/Cheney did this foul deed.
4943 2018-12-15 20:49:28 Absolutely. Just as Clinton's expansion was enabled by Dot Com and Reagan's was enabled by unwinding of severe fed money policies and much cheaper oil. Always lots more going on than econ policies of chief though left footed policies can upset prosperity -- cf Trump tariffs
4944 2018-12-15 20:49:20 2) releasing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. As a consequence,  Indonesia – the world’s largest producer of palm oil – temporarily  surpassed the United States in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in  2015. With their CO2 and methane emissions

4946 2018-12-15 20:49:13 I had malort for the first time last night since moving to Chicago and now I know what it must feel like to accidentally drink your turpentine while oil painting.
4947 2018-12-15 20:49:12 I don't debate that, but the fact of the matter is Golan belongs to Syria and the fact that genie energy are trying to plan oil pipelines and drilling there should be both a cause of concern and international outrage

4952 2018-12-15 20:48:52 You know...He is the asshole that executed the opening of national park land for oil companies. Trump will have to take over leasing the 700 million acres that belong to the American people.

4954 2018-12-15 20:48:27 1) The warm, humid climate of the tropics offers perfect growth conditions  for oil palms. Day after day, huge tracts of rainforest in Southeast  Asia, Latin America and Africa are being bulldozed or torched to make  room for more plantations
4955 2018-12-15 20:48:08 grape seed oil, often found in many facial/skincare care products, is known for its anti-aging benefits to the skin.

The madness.
4961 2018-12-15 20:47:22 How about crude oil price?
How about the additional excise duty added by Jaitley?
Don't assume that all Indians are fools.
4962 2018-12-15 20:47:12 I use to follow my marketing team (Dangote) to the market fr awareness on new , we give out products fr free, but some people are still reluctant to collect thinking you hv a motive, talk less of meeting market people with violence, what's now the diff btwn both of them?
4963 2018-12-15 20:47:11 If they don't bleed green then I am not interested in the slightest. We need massive energy infrastructure reform yesterday, full throated support for a green new deal is the lowest bar. We don't have time for crypto-oilman "my 43k in oilmoney came from oil execs its fine" Beto.
4964 2018-12-15 20:47:05 Lemme finally start this oil painting
4965 2018-12-15 20:47:02 you can make it in a lab. Its eveywhereeeeeeeee like oil.. They need to say its rare to put a value on it.. common sense
4966 2018-12-15 20:46:49 So was I. But the goals of the program are still available for you to see.
The NEP required using Canadian oil as much as possible. It included plans for refineries and pipelines to meet that goal. It was really an energy independence program.
4967 2018-12-15 20:46:48 One important fact is if the Economy doesn't stay good, healthercare cost doesn't go down, Oil prices go up, Iran / Yemen, terrorist starts back up , if interest rates go up, unemployment goes up again during all the Investigations Americans hear are coming, it will fall on you..
4968 2018-12-15 20:46:47 Idk why in my head the dressing is on the stripper...but it is...which like olive oil and balsamic is not a look

4970 2018-12-15 20:46:34 More oil. Less shampooing. Way less brushing. More conditioning.
4971 2018-12-15 20:46:32 I just tried to mediate over my stomach cramps. I think I'm a step closer to becoming an essential oil mom.
4972 2018-12-15 20:46:18 It has not eluded anyone. We need to force them to change their factories with regulations that are enforced. They will not do it unless we force them. Bottles can be made to dissolve after touching salt water and can be made from hemp instead of oil.
4973 2018-12-15 20:46:18 car is leaking oil all over the place  great
4974 2018-12-15 20:46:10 Stop transfer payments from Alberta oil to Quebec!
4975 2018-12-15 20:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but Medicare.
4976 2018-12-15 20:46:06 Of course.
4977 2018-12-15 20:46:01 i jus discovered beard oil today. my shit been thoroughbred, had no idea it was product specifically made for this  #GameOver
4978 2018-12-15 20:45:57 That’s when I start putting more old oil on it
4979 2018-12-15 20:45:53 I know I LOVE cauliflower. Buy it frozen, defrost it spread out on cookie sheet. Put Olive Oil, Goya and pepper on it and roast it for 35 minutes on 350•. I don’t know if you were being sarcastic but this is great 
4980 2018-12-15 20:45:52 My absolute favorite is Ms. Sia Koroma, Sierra Leone, with qualifications as a  nurse, and an organic chemistry Msc, and she actually worked ...becoming chief chemist in an oil  refinery plant at some point.
4981 2018-12-15 20:45:49 Idk when fat women covered in baby oil became the wave but that shit aint it
4982 2018-12-15 20:45:40 The "Feds" do not import oil. Refineries - aka independent profit-seeking businesses - do. ON is receiving all western oil at this point and QC's refineries are accepting one-half western oil. When Line 3 is in service, refineries in QC will have easier access to more. /2
4983 2018-12-15 20:45:39 It saddens and blows my mind how his government took such a principled stance against the pipeline but not so much against BC oil patches and fracking.
4984 2018-12-15 20:45:35 Using coconut oil on my skin in the winter is the equivalent of using Dollar Store lotion! Can you say instant Ash?
4985 2018-12-15 20:45:32 In sha Allah
4986 2018-12-15 20:45:28 Saudis produce higher quality oil at cheaper prices in a less energy intensive process with lower emissions. Their human rights record is a disgrace. But Canadians continue to sell arms to them & buy their cheap oil.

4990 2018-12-15 20:45:20 I am interested in the concept of an independent Scotland. Question. How would you fund an independent Scotland. Salmon said with oil revenue last time. Within 2 years would have been cap in hand to EU!
4991 2018-12-15 20:45:11 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4992 2018-12-15 20:45:04 @waitrose so your getting rid of glitter baubles by 2020 will you still be using palm oil in your Xmas puddings in 2020?#savetheorangutans
4993 2018-12-15 20:45:03 Having a boyfriend that can change your oil , rotate your tires ,and give you a car wash for free is a man worth keeping

4997 2018-12-15 20:44:43 @jkenney I’m sorry this may not be very Canadian of me but I want the equalization payments to be stopped. Let Quebec pay for daycare and university and fertility treatments like we Albertans have to. I’m glad oil and gas company bailing out of Whistler, so tired of being  on
4998 2018-12-15 20:44:43 The Big Oil companies own scientists were the first to stumble upon the evidence for global climate change in the 1970s and refused to release the findings in favour of the vast profits to be gained and in the process set the climate change debate back by decades.
4999 2018-12-15 20:44:32 Mdara are you printing mari ndo pa ndabata pa oil apo ma1 kkkkk
5000 2018-12-15 20:44:25 I ignored the palm oil reference to begin with, but I keep being brought back to it. So I'll ask. Can you explain how not using palm oil will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere?
5001 2018-12-15 20:44:21 Amma fah abokin mai kudi bah mai kudi bane
5002 2018-12-15 20:44:16 Oil! Now THAT'S a rock!
5003 2018-12-15 20:44:15 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
5004 2018-12-15 20:44:14 ZINKE Destroyed 85% of Utah’s National Park System on orders from Adolf Trump knowing nothing about the impact that the elimination of MILLIONS Acres to be replaced with oil wells & refining ~ plus commercial institutions  that DON’T benefit the PEOPLE of UTAH ~ Rep Bishop conman
5005 2018-12-15 20:43:56 But worry about industries in eastern  that btw rely on the energy industry (auto, planes, trains). Feds would rather import oil from countries who don’t have the enviro regs and horrilbe human rights violations etc. We will have to sgree to disagree.

5009 2018-12-15 20:43:25 If oil and water don't mix; being messy and anointed won't work either.
5010 2018-12-15 20:43:24 300 dollars. This is how much my car has cost me today. Add another 60 for this oil change I’m bout to get. I think Ima just get a bicycle.
5011 2018-12-15 20:43:20 I’ve heard all the excuses, having spent a lifetime in the church hearing them.

The truth of the matter is that the “leaders” in Christianity that we see are wolves. And while there are good “Christians”, they are rare.

Anyone who says different is a fish oil salesman.
5012 2018-12-15 20:43:05 Exactly. What they are fighting for is genuine but they are taking a wrong approach. Reasoning with people peacefully is way better than shouting
5013 2018-12-15 20:43:03 Zinke has taken the Department of the Interior from a steward of the nation's natural resources to a front for gas and oil interests. How to destroy a nation one department at a time.
5014 2018-12-15 20:43:01 94% of the oil imported into QC comes from the US and Canada. Fact.

This rhetoric has one purpose, to manipulate and divide Canadians.

5017 2018-12-15 20:42:36 Nice! But what about your government’s weak stance on fracking and BC oil patches ? Why not attack fracking with the same vigor that you attacked the pipeline? Why are you,to a lesser extent extent, going down the same path as the Federal Liberals? Take a green progressive stand.
5018 2018-12-15 20:42:34 Bad bad... But sha it's kinda cool
5019 2018-12-15 20:42:33 I hate getting oil changes idk which one to get I feel like they be stealing my money 
5020 2018-12-15 20:42:32 I remember learning about this frog as a child (in the 1960s or possibly 70s) and I think this is the first time I've heard of it since. Had no idea it was thought to be extinct. Fantastic it's discovered not to be. Have been boycotting products with palm oil in them for years.
5021 2018-12-15 20:42:32 Careful with that open expression of relief, Senator. If Trumpian history holds, the next Secretary of the Interior will be either Charles Koch or a sentient oil rig.
5022 2018-12-15 20:42:18 Quick “Fact Check” shows Peter Obi lied about;

1. FDI inflows into Nigeria.
2. Total number of vehicles in Nigeria.
3. Total loans available to SME.
4. Percentage of oil earnings. 
5. And about buying the highest number of computers by any African govt.

Sigh!
5023 2018-12-15 20:42:11 I'm sorry bout the crying! I know it hurts u to the very core. Have u ever tried CBD oil? It works! After giving my 13 yr golden with hip dysplasia n torn ccl for 3 weeks, he actually jumped on couch n over. I hope all goes well for all of u!
5024 2018-12-15 20:42:09 worse than blanks, really. sure there was some fiscal stimulus in it. but in an environment where, qua @farmerrf, macro fluctuations were likely to be triggered by asset mkt fluctuations, a tax cut tailored to spur price rises of already elevated asset prices worse than snake oil
5025 2018-12-15 20:42:08 Oil, oil, oil, oil...
5026 2018-12-15 20:42:02 Lol. Cleaner? Have you ever been to any of these 3rd word shitholes oil fields. Very few enviro standards at all. And let’s not even get into the the human rights standards buying their oil supports. QC hasn’t got a leg to stand on.

Also do you actually think only states with oil can issue debt?

5034 2018-12-15 20:41:31 Bingo!  Entrepreneurs make this country (oil patch, mining , business) - we’re not asking for a lot , but simply to let capitalism work

5037 2018-12-15 20:41:13 Good for Climate Change, but Trump is so dumb he’ll hire another oil guy..
5038 2018-12-15 20:41:05 First Nations WANTS it and are suing now to get it done. Vancouver and the paid protesters (see @FairQuestions )seem to not want it. Everyone uses oil but the hypocrites say we don't need it.
5039 2018-12-15 20:41:04 Sure if you don't have any oil, I suppose a sup of petrol would do?

5043 2018-12-15 20:40:31 i take two sticks of unsalted butter, soften to room temp, then whisk it together with enough light olive oil to equal the weight of one stick. i store in the fridge in a glass container. spreads pretty easily this way — certainly easier than cold butter!
5044 2018-12-15 20:40:16 Guesz the onvious needs to be stated yet again: the federal government doesn't buy oil from anyone. The oil companies buy oil and sell it. On other words, it's an industry problem
5045 2018-12-15 20:40:16 Why can't people see through these snake oil salesmen? If your religious leader appears wealthy then they aren't living by christian principles, they are merely running a business and duping gullible people.

5057 2018-12-15 20:39:16 It says 94% of the oil imported into QC comes from the US and Canada.

Doesn't match with all the divisive rhetoric you've been hearing does it? I wonder why that is 
5058 2018-12-15 20:39:09 So the world faces castrophic climate change but gas & oil exploration & exploitation (one reason for the warming) should be encouraged?
5059 2018-12-15 20:39:08 Bro it's not maybe, they were clearly wrong, only God knows what their approach would hv degenerated into if not fr the intervention of the police.
Simple engage this people, synergize and sensitize them, some will def see a need to change, than this rancour.
5060 2018-12-15 20:39:07 I need an oil change. It’s past time  #tightenup
5061 2018-12-15 20:39:06 We buy most oil from cheaper sources. Make it cleaner & cheaper.

Bombarier is unquestionably LPC&CPC corruption.

Agreed water pollution is shameful & the prioritizing emissions makes no sense, when the water infrastructure needs are so great. Urban Canada is growing too fast.

5075 2018-12-15 20:37:53 There’s also a lot more geological risk in oil, so development can take longer and cost much more than expected. Also oil development and power projects have very different costs of capital.

Seriously other countries are entitled to produce more of what gains them currency. Venezuela's oil profit decline can't be laid entirely on that.

5088 2018-12-15 20:36:29 This is nonsense I am afraid - oil accounts for a small part of UK GDP and the ability to issue gilts is not dependent on having oil - see most of the worlds nations as evidence.

5091 2018-12-15 20:36:10 The Oil Field not for everybody.  it’s alot of hard work and long hours put in behind this money. Remember that before you just up and try to get in this lifestyle. Better be ready to sacrifice alot.  this a mans job, not no lil kids mess around. 
5092 2018-12-15 20:36:04 I’m calling it done.  ( I’m pretty sure it is done).  But feeling it’s time to move onto something new.  Next?!!  Oil is still wet so will get better shot later.

5095 2018-12-15 20:35:33 Yes, right. Bombardier would be a perfect example of how Quebec works. And don’t forget all the shit you throw into the St Lawrence too. 

We don’t make oil, idiot, we extract it and the world, including you, uses it.

5123 2018-12-15 20:32:46 How about a big well-built pipeline with super electric transmission line next to it.  Clean electricity goes east and west, oil gets to market in the east, and manufacturing can get cheap energy.  Everybody wins...  let’s make @JustinTrudeau pay for it all with the carbon tax:-)
5124 2018-12-15 20:32:42 QCers work their asses off. We also pay more total taxes.

We just don't have to make oil to do it.

5126 2018-12-15 20:32:37 We can't handle that much of the large international shipping. We are highly dependent on EU ports  eg Rotterdam for oil and Far East imports (8 times the annual tonnage of Grimsby)

5129 2018-12-15 20:32:05 If we divide by number of skiers or oil production we see a different story I guess. Assume it include the generous compensations/subsidies for exploration?

5146 2018-12-15 20:30:24 It is soooo pulsing that farmers, the ones who stand to lose the most out of climate warming would not be in favor of a carbon levy!? AB stands to lose so much, oil industry+farming, but yet they don't want carbon levy.

Do you think dumping of USED CAR OIL into streets and construction site throw outs like toilets and garbage makes our cities cleaner??? I agree With @adamcarolla  . Virtue signaling: PATHETIC
5154 2018-12-15 20:29:12 Do a castor oil treatment once a week and take hair vitamins. I did a below shoulder chop last summer an I have only like two inches left to grow till it's back below my ribs.
5155 2018-12-15 20:29:04 I just gave $80 to someone for their oil change. But I don’t appreciate the attitude. Smh
5156 2018-12-15 20:28:48 Let’s remember that Zinke’s corruption wasn’t limited to travel or private contracts. His corrupt policies and decisions should be reviewed and overturned, including his move to hand over more than 2 million acres of parks and monuments to oil and mining companies.
5157 2018-12-15 20:28:41 @JustinTrudeau how about we add a tariff of $30 barrel of oil coming into Canada and send it to Alberta as An equalization payment to help our oil and gas industry?
5158 2018-12-15 20:28:07 I think what you’re doing is great and wish to learn about oil lamps and kerosene as well. I’ve looked into getting a windmill for energy usage being from okla with all the wind we get here
5159 2018-12-15 20:28:01 Let’s make sure to prevent anyone pro drilling from ruining our coast and livelihoods. Here’s your pro oil candidate folks for OUR district.
5160 2018-12-15 20:27:59 Oil changes are expensive
5161 2018-12-15 20:27:57 Took my car to the dealer for an oil change. Told them I'd pass on the $198 service package so they called later to tell me if I need my murky power steering fluid flushed they can do that for $195.
5162 2018-12-15 20:27:51 Yorkshire biscuits, we mixed up the amount of oil to batter 
5163 2018-12-15 20:27:44 Guy now... Wetin bring doll enter matter now?
5164 2018-12-15 20:27:33 extruding those tears like a delicious churro into hot oil
5165 2018-12-15 20:27:26 Canada doesn't import oil from SA, producers do. Sounds like you want a national energy plan which I am also in favour of.
5166 2018-12-15 20:27:23 I part boil then in a tray with olive oil salt and pepper and a little thyme result nice crisp outside soft inside 
5167 2018-12-15 20:27:14 So I read somewhere that you could use petroleum jelly to take off your make up and I was super lazy to find some Vaseline so I used coconut oil and it worked like a charm
5168 2018-12-15 20:27:02 Make we no lie wetin those guys do no make sense at all, but you get one point and the point be say that you no fit expect anything better from uneducated guys like that.
5169 2018-12-15 20:26:37 Of a truth the price of oil is higher in the previous adm but so all so was the subsidy higher and a liter was cheaper then,now the price of the oil is lower making the subsidy lower too but we are buying fuel higher now, when you minus and plus the difference will not be much
5170 2018-12-15 20:26:24 #Iamkratom lot of changes for me in 2019 for 212lb to 189 in the dec 15 time for the Keto diet. Time to eat healthy 1500mg of cbd oil to treat my pains and kick opiates ass
5171 2018-12-15 20:26:14 I try the camomile essential oil it is for calming n uplifting the mood. Now i think im overdose n cant being hyper cnt sleep. It lifting the damn well
5172 2018-12-15 20:26:11 Oil be using them later
5173 2018-12-15 20:26:01 Yeah, but the deflating oil prices can also be ascribed to their subsidy of it as well as increased competition world wide. Unless they are blockaded they are still free to trade.
5174 2018-12-15 20:25:51 I'll blame them, they don't reason with their brain.
5175 2018-12-15 20:25:41 Aayana uddesam only oil nimpukuni ani..
5176 2018-12-15 20:25:35 We are sick
5177 2018-12-15 20:25:32 Probably brought it out on Twitter to receive heroic accolade, people applauding her are just deceiving her. A market where men are not even safe u carried ur feminism matter enta. She shouldn't mistake foolishness for bravery
5178 2018-12-15 20:25:25 You're a corrupt snake oil salesman and should probably steer clear of any moral judgments about literally any organizaton. The word Pharisee comes to mind whenever I see your name.
5179 2018-12-15 20:25:21 Trump answers to Putin? Is that why he's building our military back up. Why he backed out of the Iran deal that Russia supported and made the US independent from foreign oil.  Got it.
5180 2018-12-15 20:24:58 eucalyptus oil and burn some sage
5181 2018-12-15 20:24:48 crawfish & garlic noodles they cool just put too much oil in they flavors like I tasted the sea food more than the flavor cause of all the damn oil they use  ima stick to rockin crawfish after I try this place in concord I been seeing on fb
5182 2018-12-15 20:24:46 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @theroygreenshow  hey Roy using Veterans & victims of crime to help Conservatives get elected -- it has been a full court press on the CORUSERVATIVE Network - Have you no shame - Yesterday Adler saying people against oil are like NAZIS against Alberta FOX North
5183 2018-12-15 20:24:31 We have oil?
5184 2018-12-15 20:24:20 And yet, the vast majority of investment has been in climate denial disinformation and political lobbying to defang climate change mitigation legislation.. the only longer term planning has been in altering infrastructure designs of oil rigs and pipelines..
5185 2018-12-15 20:24:12 Diije
5186 2018-12-15 20:24:11 You will be right. In 2017 according to statistica and other sources in world over 56% of oil exploiting is for transport. And really 50% for cars trucks ...
5187 2018-12-15 20:24:05 this "new green deal" seems like it disproportionally affects the poor. i'm sure poor people can afford energy efficient things, electric cars, etc..until you make "green energy" cost effective it doesnt do squat. coal is still cheaper, so is nuclear and Oil.
5188 2018-12-15 20:24:04 Reorganized storage unit and got my oil changed this morning. Me-1 the overwhelming abyss of melancholy-0
5189 2018-12-15 20:24:03 Stop drilling you've struck oil.
5190 2018-12-15 20:23:51 How many con artist, snake oil sales men, scammers who have services out there for options trading can you name? I need to know if we are on the same page. Too many hacks taking innocent people's hard fucking earned money. Something has to be done about this.
5191 2018-12-15 20:23:51 Who can do an oil change RIGHT now?
5192 2018-12-15 20:23:49 LOOP LOADS 3 VLCCS IN SEVEN DAYS
Covington, Louisiana, December 10, 2018
 
In the last seven days, three VLCCs have departed LOOP’s Marine Terminal full of domestic crude oil.  As the demand for exports from Louisiana increases, LOOP LOADS 3 VLCCS IN SEVEN DAYS
5193 2018-12-15 20:23:32 Just pour salt inside the oil, shake and seal. It won't get spoilt for at least a year
5194 2018-12-15 20:23:28 Oil n Vinegar Existence.
5195 2018-12-15 20:23:28 That’ll show Saudi Arabia and other foreign oil exporters we mean business. Just not Canadian business.
5196 2018-12-15 20:23:28 I posted my complete process.. just use salt & rinse with water & oil it. I don't heat mine. 

You can barely read the USA on the bottom of mine I've used it so much. That's the only wording on the bottom no maker
5197 2018-12-15 20:23:23 You can't wait for Nigeria to get destabilized  finally like our oil refineries
5198 2018-12-15 20:23:15 Hydrogen created with alternative energy can be delivered to pumps for $2 per kg (equivalent in energy to a gallon of gasoline) by being piped as ammonia (NH3) in existing pipelines and converted cheaply at stations to H2. We have no need to power our vehicles with oil.
5199 2018-12-15 20:23:11 gonna try coconut oil in my hair again
5200 2018-12-15 20:22:57 Cheers car, 10 sleeps till Christmas and you decide you want an oil change... agaiiiiinnnn fml.
5201 2018-12-15 20:22:54 Does West Coast Environmental Law receive any funding from foreign (U.S.) NGO’s who are working to land lock Canadian oil to the benefit of the American economy of 80 million a day? Is this is about the weather or is it a corporate shakedown?
5202 2018-12-15 20:22:40 fuck crude oil
5203 2018-12-15 20:22:40 Jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja están haciendo una vaquita, para cargarle gas oil!!! jajaja jajaja jajaja
5204 2018-12-15 20:22:35 Focus more on SMEs and less on the oil sector. Progress starts from there. #vicepresidentialdebate
5205 2018-12-15 20:22:34 in Canada we have gov'ts continue to 'invest' and promote oil and gas.  Trudeau keeps on talking about growing the economy and protecting the environment at the same time.  He recently bought  a pipeline so we can export more tarsands bitumen The opposition party is worse
5206 2018-12-15 20:22:18 My brother leave them, they're unnecessarily brilliant, they'll never see the truth in what we are saying, they'll meet their waterloo soo.
5207 2018-12-15 20:22:17 They never clean up their mess. I grew up in Lynnwood. Imperial oil left a ton of contamination behind. I have elevated lead levels as a result of playing in the dirt in my youth. They only recently cleaned up their mess from 40 years ago. And it was a right to make it happen.
5208 2018-12-15 20:22:14 And the "richer* urban areas are entirely fed by resources produced in the rural areas....oil, meat, produce, grains, milk, cheese, etc. Remove the subsidies and see how $25 hamburgers and $5 glasses of milk taste. $30 salads for you vegans! #citylife #dumbfucks
5209 2018-12-15 20:22:11 Putting coconut oil on all my problems
5210 2018-12-15 20:22:05 As we were just outside of Paris at Les Cedres. I was initially a big PSG fan, but the outside oil money really changed the culture, and it sort of makes me gag
5211 2018-12-15 20:22:00 can u blame them we live in a bitter society
5212 2018-12-15 20:21:52 My opinion is that tucker carlson is a white supremacist, fascist propaganda spreader and all around snake oil salesman, the fact that he cuts his hair like a dork is just the cherry on top of the shit sundae, happy now?
5213 2018-12-15 20:21:50 I did something similar for my GIS class! I used LA County and overlapped the buffer of oil and gas wells in relation to American Indian and “Latinx”/indigenous populations
5214 2018-12-15 20:21:37 @charliebomber just test drove an 04 c320 4matic for great price but had some front end shake over 65 and smelled (though couldn't find) some burning oil. If my gambling days weren't behind me...
5215 2018-12-15 20:21:10 We wonder what oil you use when you perform such a massage then ?
5216 2018-12-15 20:21:10 For active pimples - tea tree oil diluted with water.. & im also using epanouie skin care line for mask & nightcream
5217 2018-12-15 20:21:06 People are just enemies of the truth , they're unnecessarily bitter.
5218 2018-12-15 20:21:05 Yep. Yep. Yep. We'd have been better off without an oil industry.
5219 2018-12-15 20:20:59 You trying to take one for the team and marry an oil tycoon?
5220 2018-12-15 20:20:48 It is not healthy ... use olive oil or grapeseed oil instead ... seriously ...
5221 2018-12-15 20:20:44 My grandpa is paying for my first oil change in my new car and they're playing star wars on the TV, and he keeps telling me random trivia things about each scene. I love my family.
5222 2018-12-15 20:20:42 Publicity to help restage his tired old Trump brand.   Also I believe he did run for the potential oil fields which were supposed to happen when sanctions were lifted! What a cheaters paradise !
5223 2018-12-15 20:20:39 Showing a placard to an illiterate and enforcing ur opinion while the only thing they undstd is "agree or force". They were lucky policemen was there, they wouldn't have made it out complete. Wonder how people we think are educated reason before taking an action.

5226 2018-12-15 20:20:03 If I'm not mistaken the total value of royalties collected since lougheed is less than 260B. All the subsidies and tax breaks when combined with clean up costs will dwarf the benefits we've received from our oil industry. Leaving us with a giant net loss.
5227 2018-12-15 20:20:00 That oil money.
5228 2018-12-15 20:19:51 Analysts at Fitch Solutions Macro Research have revised their oil price forecasts to 2022, 27/11/18
The analysts now forecast that Brent will average:
$73 per barrel in 2018
$75 per barrel in 2019
$82 per barrel in 2020
$84 per barrel in 2021
$85 per barrel in 2022

5229 2018-12-15 20:19:46 CBD oil. Works.
5230 2018-12-15 20:19:45 I think that number is really just the tip of the iceberg. And it's not the oil companies that will pay to look after the mess they made. It'll be us, the taxpayers.
5231 2018-12-15 20:19:40 I was properly dispose this coolant. I went to the auto part, they ain’t take it. Went to the oil change spot and they said throw it in the dumpster in the back... I was just trying to care about the environment
5232 2018-12-15 20:19:39 I was gifted a bottle of black truffle oil and I'm overwhelmed with what to do
5233 2018-12-15 20:19:38 please noplease don't add oil on fire
5234 2018-12-15 20:19:24 Domestic oil is unethical because why ? Sounds very troll like.
5235 2018-12-15 20:19:17 Aww, now he can’t embrace some other evil and twisted campaign, like lifting restrictions on hunting the bald eagle (too many of those damned birds, anyway!), or drilling for oil in Central Park (all those open meadows un-tapped, it’s in-American!). Good riddance! #DrainTheSwamp
5236 2018-12-15 20:19:10 All those guys are coconut oil players.
5237 2018-12-15 20:19:09 Yeah it’s usually stress or hormone related. I use maracuja oil and a charcoal clay mask to help dry it out. A dab of toothpaste on it at night before bed also helps when you’re in a pinch (like when I’m traveling and don’t have all my skincare with me)
5238 2018-12-15 20:18:56 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
5239 2018-12-15 20:18:47 I think if public officials engage in corruption, such as defraud taxpayers and sell off the public's lands to rich oil & gas pals, they should be stripped of their citizenship and deported to any country that'll take 'em. Problem solved.
5240 2018-12-15 20:18:16 Hmmm.

Oregano Olive Oil Unapologetically Independent


5241 2018-12-15 20:18:14 Just had a beard oil company I used last month call and try to pitch me hard. Told her no thanks, I now use coconut oil and the tears of communist as my go to because it made me feel like I was on a tropical vacation and smelled like freedom. 1) Why didn't she find that funny?

5244 2018-12-15 20:17:41 Weird, so Canada has oil and the @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau @albertaNDP doesn’t want to use it, but also #Liberals have a problem with #SaudiOil. So how are Canadians going to drive around. #CrisisComing
5245 2018-12-15 20:17:36 I am not with the taking money from oil companies
5246 2018-12-15 20:17:21 Plainly 
5247 2018-12-15 20:17:17 Oil paint just takes about a week to dry so that's prob why ppl don't like using it. The wait time is a bit long ;;;
5248 2018-12-15 20:17:07 Yeah, I’m sure Jesus would’ve bombed thousands of people for oil and profit.

You are disturbed.
5249 2018-12-15 20:16:52 Went and bought some wild growth oil too
5250 2018-12-15 20:16:48 I'm not saying I'm against pipelines. Time and time again they've proven to be the safest way to transport oil and they bosst economy significantly. I'm just saying that the Premier's direction on this is a bit off
5251 2018-12-15 20:16:47 Where is the west which ruined every stable muslim country,surely of we had a oil every one would have paid heed towards India's occupational terrorism in Kashmir.
5252 2018-12-15 20:16:31 For breakfast I fried eggs in the leftover seasoned oil from last night's roast vegetables and they're delicious but goddamn these are some ugly eggs
5253 2018-12-15 20:16:28 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
5254 2018-12-15 20:16:26 Damn someone should let the AB oil and gas companies to not pay their carbon tax portion of their bills. Can we reference you in case anyone has issues with that? #AskingForAFriend
5255 2018-12-15 20:16:24 The @Wendys @ corner o Goldenrod & Marketplace orlando is a health hazard & needs 2b shuttered. Dark brown fries? Told the manager u're either burning them or havent changed the oil. We're gonna change the oil tonight. All I got were fries. Waited again. Came out less Dark brown.
5256 2018-12-15 20:16:16 @DelishCondish do you know when the oil cleanser wil be restocked?
5257 2018-12-15 20:16:15 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
5258 2018-12-15 20:16:07 too big words from a guy whose desert kingdom was established with the British help and got lucky thanks to oil reserves. you should utter words relevant to your own league. Stop pontificating about things that exceed your capacity and posture!
5259 2018-12-15 20:15:52 Sliding one deep on this pressure an oil
5260 2018-12-15 20:15:35 Yes, but than Europe has to stop buying both gas and oil from Russia. North Stream 2 is just a mean of transportation.
5261 2018-12-15 20:15:31 This doesn't account for the money we'll have to spend on the tailing ponds' clean up, abandoned well maintenance, the inevitable oil spills, whether train, truck or pipeline. Nor does it at all account for the health costs.
5262 2018-12-15 20:15:06 He doesn't want the label bc he is not progressive per voting record. I was really excited about him until I found out how he has voted.  EX: Take a look at H.R 702 crude oil export ban. Beto voted against this. He also voted for H.R. 5538 Offshore drilling in the east golf.
5263 2018-12-15 20:14:53 Y so mean
5264 2018-12-15 20:14:37 Monte Solberg puts Province before Country. Empty offices in Calgary are the scares of bad government. Who can he blame now. He’s an old soldier still fighting old wars. He is deaf to the future and the multi technological disruptions Canada faces. Oil rents have been squandered.
5265 2018-12-15 20:14:31 Zinke’s replacement - scary as hell because he is shrewd + smart, drips w/oil + connections. With David Berhhardt, we must be more vigilant.
5266 2018-12-15 20:14:28 It was on oil and gas. I don't have it with me unfortunately.
5267 2018-12-15 20:14:28 The Little Pacific Project for Refilling Lake Mead is going viral on YouTube. Joi Scientific can desalinating ocean water as a free byproduct of replacing expensive oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear energy.

5271 2018-12-15 20:13:51 I feel like I could customize a nendo but it'd be a lot of work... And I might not have the tools T T I've seen forums say I could just use oil paint but idk ;;;

5276 2018-12-15 20:13:02 It’s total bullshit with a concentrated effort to trick people into buying their snake oil.
5277 2018-12-15 20:12:57 You know most of our problem on twitter comes from lack of comprehension , even the so called feminist don't understand feminism they're unnecessarily bitter.
Some people didn't even watch the videos before ranting.
5278 2018-12-15 20:12:57 Ignorant tweet.
The economic engine of canada is a concept I imagine you have trouble grasping.

This is the quintessential tweet from a lower-mainlander flake that uses oil, but advertises they dont.

5282 2018-12-15 20:12:28 Even the simple oil change.
5283 2018-12-15 20:12:25 Sweet! Bud, hash and oil is all I had available when I was younger lol. Come such a long way lol. Must try it.

5287 2018-12-15 20:11:01 So bring it to Ontario and refine it here  let quebec used justin's muslim buddy's oil
5288 2018-12-15 20:10:55 my group is supposed to argue about how oil is good... literally nothing is good about oil except for the fact that it's efficient
5289 2018-12-15 20:10:52 What about Johnson's baby oil? brah
5290 2018-12-15 20:10:48 Tension is rising in Kakumiro where Kasambya residents are on the verge of losing land earmarked for hosting part of the East African Oil Pipeline project. The landlord based in Kampala sold off the land after the village was identified as the site of project. #NBSLiveAt9
5291 2018-12-15 20:10:35 Not a lot. I generally root against them because they are a traditional rival of PSG. I went to Les Cedres before they were bought by oil money and went to a game at Parc des Princes. It was against Rennes. It was INSANE!
5292 2018-12-15 20:10:33 thats a lot of motor oil
5293 2018-12-15 20:10:29 The blame most definitely isn't only on the end users. We need to be given options.

And we know for decades oil companies deliberately obscured and lied about the effects of climate change. They are corporate criminals like tobacco companies.
5294 2018-12-15 20:10:27 My mom got me some CBD oil for Christmas and just gave it to me and goes “so am I a cool mom” 
5295 2018-12-15 20:10:25 i feel you, girl. i truly tried anything and everything too. the baking oil, fenty primer, glossier primer, primers on top of serums and oils, even no primer, priming spray.... you name it. 
i wanted to believe too 
5296 2018-12-15 20:10:14 Ok, peace, all the best. Good luck with their incitement called peaceful protest.
5297 2018-12-15 20:10:13 Illusion of oil @Kerry25Rhodes...
5298 2018-12-15 20:10:11 Pesto.
One bulb garlic (peeled, trimmed) (yes, one bulb, not clove)
As much fresh basil as you have (or about 1/4c dried basil)
1c nuts (Pine nuts are best, followed by macadamia, then walnuts, then you're on your own)
1c olive oil
Blend.
Add 1c fine grated parmesan and/or romano
5299 2018-12-15 20:10:05 I want to believe, I really do; but when I go for long walks along the beach, I can’t help but notice...  the beach is RIGHT where I found it in 1969. Al Gore is a snake oil salesman and the preachy scientists are worse than Nostradamus!!
5300 2018-12-15 20:10:03 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
5301 2018-12-15 20:10:02 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
5302 2018-12-15 20:09:54 Dude. as it says: How the numbers are calculated are disputed. we do NOT spend all the oil we produce.
5303 2018-12-15 20:09:33 I love my little car  I took her to get an oil change, filled her tank & got her new windshield wipers
5304 2018-12-15 20:09:30 The REALITY is that the world uses oil for virtually everything, and that the "interests" of the Economist are purely based on American's interests. Tell this bs to China and Saudi Arabia, not us. Thanks but NO THANKS.
5305 2018-12-15 20:09:30 Id believe this to be true f they were not simply shifting the risk.  Lining our highways and railways with increased oil, at the displacement of other products, is certainly a risk too, all the while exporting your own combustible fossil fuels.
5306 2018-12-15 20:09:26 Lol i scheduled to get my oil change at 8am today i hella forgot about nghtmre at the time. I woke up at 7:55 
5307 2018-12-15 20:09:11 Just saw the reason for the protest,indeed you right, most of them are illiterates ,taking up placards and shouting to their faces isn’t exactly the way to go,constant orientation would do the trick
tensions currently high on this thread so it was the wrong time to bring it up
5308 2018-12-15 20:09:05 Then why has he been a yes vote on environmentally harmful proposals and a no vote on Environmentally friendly proposals? For example: HR5388 offshore drilling in the east shore (He voted Yes) which passed the house or H.R.702 crude oil export ban  (He voted against this).
5309 2018-12-15 20:09:05 Once you join politics you must have a thick skin , you'll encounter a lot of foolish people

5312 2018-12-15 20:08:05 How about just a drop of peppermint essential oil/kernel of REAL peppermint hard candy? Or, just PLAIN Cola Syrup, still available in most drug stores relatively inexpensively.

CAUTION: for the T2D/T1D/IR Px, Cola Syrup might not be fall w/in the sugar restrict˚ guidelines.
5313 2018-12-15 20:08:04 prijo, prevencije radi, uzmi "tree oil"  , moze i peppermint oil, (zaboravih kako se kaze na nasem) utrljaj u kosu sat-dva, kada je "sezona vasaka"...

- Should be a law to the dreams come true but the reality is very different with evil illusions, with the darkest part of we. Our sleeps made a strange fantasy like guns in the sky, like a dog drinks some oil and nothing happend but is our reality.

5323 2018-12-15 20:07:08 baby is due in 5 days, 5 god damn days and I just got my first stretch mark on my stomach fuck bio oil it’s a scam I put that stupid shit on every day and what did I get for it, A GOD DAMN STRETCH MARK
5324 2018-12-15 20:07:01 Like fucking why? Why don’t they suck each other dick instead of the poor vegetables?
5325 2018-12-15 20:06:59 Don't "bait and switch" me. If I buy five NR.3 M1A2 SEP, I better not get a T-34 as my free one. Also, I want a complementary undercoating, two oil change vouchers, and a bumper sticker that's says "my other car is a fucking tank"
5326 2018-12-15 20:06:58 There's no ill going on a peaceful protest on the streets, it's done all over the world. You can't give flyers to oppressive men, the probability they'll throw it immediately is 100%.
5327 2018-12-15 20:06:50 Sitting at Russell Westbrook Chrysler getting my oil change who wants to bring me lunch
5328 2018-12-15 20:06:36 People don't understand how difficult and wasteful it is to make oil out of the tarsands. It's appallingly inefficient. Nor do people realise - or care - how heavily subsidised the tarsands are.
5329 2018-12-15 20:06:17 One 100% correct! Their mentality belong BC, and its not about to chage. How come other oil rich countries don't want to help them? Send them to the Saudis...or to the Emirates. They should get along well. Same culture.
5330 2018-12-15 20:06:12 Use coconut oil on your skin x
5331 2018-12-15 20:06:12 Likely never. The ironic part is had we continued with the NEP we wouldn't be exporting raw bitumen, the domestic needs would be met by domestic oil and we'd have all the pipelines we need.  We're literally whining and demanding the outcomes of the NEP be made reality today.
5332 2018-12-15 20:05:59 Cara Monica Frassoni non servono le norme europee, ci sono le norme OIL che sono costantemente disapplicate.

5333 2018-12-15 20:05:56 At a art museum,
Luke: This painting is has alot of angles
Paulie: Yeah it’s like it’s combining a type of modernism with cubism, which is wierd because the artist is usually known a more of a traditional style, even though it was done with oil, not acrylics 
Luke: Yeah...totally – bij Phoenix Art Museum
5334 2018-12-15 20:05:55 I’m very oily and honestly I go through phases. It doesn’t really stop my oil at all, but I feel like I’m trying and honestly that helps me get through the day. Lol
5335 2018-12-15 20:05:52 Do putin or evil house of saud get to weigh in? Since in the #trumpcrimefamily administration the interior is all about pumping as much oil as possible and skimming the proceeds into GOP bank account- or repaying the russian mob. #PutinsPuppet
5336 2018-12-15 20:05:50 Honestly just conditioner for the last month. Usually I’ll do conditioner and some oil. Maybe some type of curling cream if im up to it. But mostly conditioner
5337 2018-12-15 20:05:38 Deep fried chips are obviously nicer but good actifry chips get 80% there I’d say - a lot less hassle too obviously, no need to heat up a big pan of oil, they cook / turn themselves while you’re cooking something else etc 
5338 2018-12-15 20:05:28 I always forget to bring a snack with me when I get my oil changed and it's always so sad

5340 2018-12-15 20:05:21 So Zinke’s temporary replacement at Interior is a former oil lobbyist. Is it absolutely impossible for Trump to not put a piece of garbage in every leadership role?
5341 2018-12-15 20:05:09 Oil and vinegar mental illness?
5342 2018-12-15 20:05:07 This would be good, am trying to convince the wife that rapeseed oil is better than the other known non rapeseed oil.
5343 2018-12-15 20:05:06 While Petronas may be traditional oil & gas, it's a good start since it gives unis some entrpreneurial exposure instead of 0 for most business programs. When Petronas evolves, so will stations. Plus, we should encourage more companies to work with unis, so I take this positively.
5344 2018-12-15 20:05:02 Please explain this tewwt better. How is this bringing more money than oil companies?
5345 2018-12-15 20:04:44 Lol guys .. that's just oil to protect nail colour from spreading on skin .. p.s : nails that long .. I'm not a fan either
5346 2018-12-15 20:04:44 Crazy, right? But big oil, military and pharma are good. Plus blue states subsidize red.
5347 2018-12-15 20:04:44 All true, but I disagree with the solution and conclusion reached by open border advocates.
If you like low wages and shorter boom/ bust business cycles  then open borders is the way to go.
5348 2018-12-15 20:04:42 I believe @NJHoopsHaven and @JPPelzman will join me in using the old Bobby Gonzalez line to describe the first half:

It wasn't an oil painting.

WTI has been in a heavy consolidation since 11/29. If you have made money during this period, your trading skill is above par. Anyone who could have survived WTI's brutal and violent moves is not an ordinary trader.
5351 2018-12-15 20:04:31 I like this ruling very much,
I really do, Progressive Push
I like it cause it stops the pipe
I like it cause the trees are nice
I like it because oil can drip
I do not want an apocalypse
5352 2018-12-15 20:04:18 It's true, and I didn't know about the San Ardo oil fields and their status as the worst, until just recently.
5353 2018-12-15 20:04:08 That Dawn commercial where they clean baby ducks and otters is really cute but part of me wonders if they just dumped oil all over a duck.
5354 2018-12-15 20:04:05 Such is life bro... Our government of today never Care abt Education no more except 4rm Oil..  Awon wehrey...
5355 2018-12-15 20:04:05 @JustinTrudeau it’s time for a national energy corridor for oil and gas, and electricity. A strong country treats all provinces as equal. Mr Prime Minister take that strip of land from coast to coast and glue this country together. It’s long overdue!
5356 2018-12-15 20:04:04 We'll be dead as a species if we don't stop using oil in the next 20 years. And we need to go carbon negative in 30 to avoid the worst of climate change.
5357 2018-12-15 20:04:03 I’d rather be boiled in oil than eat Miracle Whip 
5358 2018-12-15 20:03:57 Report to NM Senate Dem caucus today: percentage of State revenues reliant on oil and gas production has gone from 35% in 2011, to today in excess of 45%.

5363 2018-12-15 20:03:45 Oil isn't an issue with a high commander level as long as you do your commissions and aren't running fleets over 35 cost too often.
5364 2018-12-15 20:03:13 So nationalizing their oil industry, an inflation rate of 1,370,000%, a currency that is worth $0.10 to the US Dollar &  bread lines are the United States fault?

5367 2018-12-15 20:02:48 @Olivefarmer do you have a video showing olives being pressed and the oil coming out? I would like such a clip without copy rights showing the contrast to oils from chem factories :)
5368 2018-12-15 20:02:27 I'd simply suggest that AB's recent struggles aren't a result of the feds giving equalization payments to the nation's poorest provinces it's a result of oil companies giving the AB government less in royalties, & being unwilling to either raise taxes or cut spending in response.
5369 2018-12-15 20:02:25 You sell veg oil?
5370 2018-12-15 20:02:23 @adamcarolla getting my oil changed ..they are playing classical music in the waiting area. It’s pretty nice.
5371 2018-12-15 20:02:20 Not only animals have suffered under Zinke. The dismantling of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante are tragedy for Native American culture and open lands given to the oil companies and mineral exploitation.
5372 2018-12-15 20:02:19 That is what happens when you have cleared out anyone willing to present a different perspective & only the cult members or paid shills remain. As has been said of the scientists paid for by oil and cigarette companies, you get results you demanded when you control purse strings.
5373 2018-12-15 20:02:18 Just got my oil changed and the new widow sticker says the next one is scheduled for June 15.  I'll be retired by then.  It's getting real.
5374 2018-12-15 20:02:13 Art, just wondering if I could ask you about EIA reported USA crude weekly production number: 11 million barrels a day does not mean 11 million barrels of liquid crude oil, it is equivalent, which means it could include lots of natural gas ?
5375 2018-12-15 20:02:11 Its a concentrate made from herb. Like hash oil, its just more thc in it
5376 2018-12-15 20:02:02 Twitter hivemind, can someone explain how  gas and oil piped from mainland Europe to Dublin will be taxed under WTO arrangements? #backstop #Brexit
5377 2018-12-15 20:01:56 Tried coconut oil on my hair! Never again!
5378 2018-12-15 20:01:49 Republicans use their "hatred of government," as an excuse to rob it blind.Becuz that same govt helps a limited number of needy,they justify big oil and insurance fleecing those needy in hc and arbitrary oil price hikes not tied to supply and demand.
5379 2018-12-15 20:01:36 So leave the oil in the ground as Quebec and others insist. What replaces the lost tax revenue to Canada? Green energy is not coming overnight but many of these comments seem to think so. We will never be able to totally do without oil and its related products.
5380 2018-12-15 20:01:25 Ok maybe that was the issue ...I tried a vape with oil but it definitely had THC....I was a wreak the entire day.

5386 2018-12-15 20:00:29 Sorry I misread your tweet. You are right, California has the dirtiest oil in North America but everyone points at Alberta.

5390 2018-12-15 20:00:15 Yes but we all need huge incentives to ditch our gas/oil boilers so we can afford the heat pumps.
5391 2018-12-15 20:00:09 New tiressss new speakers and I got an oil change. About time 
5392 2018-12-15 19:59:53 What are the chances Marie's carries coconut oil

5395 2018-12-15 19:59:41 So what good has this approach yielded? My brother you and I know, that way they took was wrong, am a Muslim, I don't support their act neither do I support free mixing, it's against my religion, but nevertheless you can't correct an ill with another ill.

5398 2018-12-15 19:59:33 Hey Knoxville. I’m looking for local mechanics for an oil change. Who do you go see?
5399 2018-12-15 19:59:20 Load of bollcks if your cbd oil did not have a carrier such as olive oil mct etc then it would just be paste
5400 2018-12-15 19:59:18 No, you don’t. If you did, you’d oppose our foreign policy (mining, oil, coups) that profits us & destroys Central American land, causing the need to emigrate. You’re simply prejudiced, esp. b/c even in emigration, their lower crime stats & economic contribution help us. Bigot.
5401 2018-12-15 19:59:09 You're like someone in 1830 scoffing that we'll never be able to light our lamps without whale oil and that anti whalers want darkness
5402 2018-12-15 19:59:08 Does Western include BC? It seems like the biggest obstacle to oil pipelines from AB is British Columbia (people and NGOs as well as government).
5403 2018-12-15 19:59:06 How interesting that the NIH would find corn oil, something we produce much of nationally, healthier than olive oil, something we import much of...
5404 2018-12-15 19:59:02 This is the music of my generation. The first truly anti-war generation, we thought. And look at all the wars we let the money changers lead us into, still. They distract us with social issues, so they can dig in and rape and pillage countries, for oil and money.
5405 2018-12-15 19:58:54 I would absolutely help him by pouring oil on the ledge.
5406 2018-12-15 19:58:45 I think he wants to turn my Twitter into an oil resort. But I have a surprise for him—I am from Huge City, and I have a snow curse.
5407 2018-12-15 19:58:42 He thinks we should be sucking the oil filled teets from SA instead of producing our own. The same country starving out Yemen! We need to focus on getting Trump out of office. Full stop!
5408 2018-12-15 19:58:35 I can’t comment on the approach cause I’ve no idea what the protest was for, 

I’m saying these folks selling jeans and other stuff wether in yaba or anywhere will hold you or touch you immediately there’s an eye contact and it’s annoying
5409 2018-12-15 19:58:25 He has already over estimated his budget at 64 a barrel. You spend what you have not what you wish for. Look back Parnell did it to  Alaska also. Unless oil spikes were in deep kimchi
5410 2018-12-15 19:58:17 If you genuinely don't believe an educated oil rich country can be independent then I genuinely pity you. You're like a sadly underconfidant shit looking for hand outs. Good luck.
5411 2018-12-15 19:58:16 I have a bottle of fresh snake oil; would you like to try that? Trump's is stale.
5412 2018-12-15 19:58:15 Don't be absurd... it will be a KFC branded, fried chicken flavored vape oil.
5413 2018-12-15 19:58:10 Speaker I am loving everything you’re doing! We’re behind ya all the way. Please don’t let any of these bastards escape justice after destroying the people’s property for the profit of oil, gas, & corporate interests. For the good of the country they must pay 4 their crimes
5414 2018-12-15 19:57:48 Yup - it should not stick if you're using it properly. I have four cast iron pans, three of which are passed down from my grandmother - aside from the salt and oil scrub, they've never been "washed", and they're perfect. I just brushed off fried egg residue with a paper towel 
5415 2018-12-15 19:57:47 Canadian Natural Resources president Tim McKay says: "Canadian oil and natural gas is an important part of the solution to reducing global GHG emissions."  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  Was PT Barnum right?
5416 2018-12-15 19:57:23 It makes more sense for us to use up foreign oil and gas before we consume our own natural resources
5417 2018-12-15 19:57:10 Any evidence that oil rule actually exists?
5418 2018-12-15 19:57:03 I have a lovely bottle of snake oil over here on this shelf, would you like to buy some? Trickle down bs is always the greatest until it isn’t.  Same old line they sell every time. Odd it is never ever their fault when it doesn’t work again though isn’t it.
5419 2018-12-15 19:57:02 Having read numerous books on the Eastern Front war between Germany and the Soviets, the evidence shows your right Steven.
USA 
farmers provided food,  Capitalists Manufacturing provided equipment & Clothing, oil, & other lubricants, metals. 
Good old USA 'Spam,'was a favorite.
5420 2018-12-15 19:57:00 Half and half? With a drop of weed oil...
5421 2018-12-15 19:56:32 Ow. Grease or oil got on ya?
5422 2018-12-15 19:56:29 Why would I attack innocent people sensitising my fellow oppressors by peacefully walking down a road, holding placards? They basically showed why the march was needed.
5423 2018-12-15 19:56:24 No oil or other fat - just gentle heating
5424 2018-12-15 19:56:04 Yes. This is 20 years average.
20 years ago Oil was at $10
5425 2018-12-15 19:55:59 Yeah. So many frameworks for "equality" are patronizing and often perpetuate not seeing minorities as fully-formed people. I think some of it's intentional. Unfortunately, many follow.

We live in the age of the grifter. Can't sell more snake oil if it truly fixes the problem...
5426 2018-12-15 19:55:25 Imagine a Nigeria with no crude oil. 
5427 2018-12-15 19:55:16 Our beloved Vnz used to be a country model in LATAM before "the revolution". These bastards have 20 years focused on destroying the foundations of the Republic+ country social&econ systems (s.a: health, oil, agriculture, manufact, electr, gold reserves, and so on).
5428 2018-12-15 19:54:50 You don’t get to dictate to survivors how to fight their oppressors. You truly believe that those people will read “leaflets” or you believe women should beg men not to assault them? My good God

5430 2018-12-15 19:54:28 Yknow as a dude who does work with oil rigs I really like Deepwater Horizon but watching it does give me anxiety.
5431 2018-12-15 19:54:21 It's Xmas shopping crunch time! Why not destress a little by picking up some oil from the Goddess? It's all 10% off on this fine shatterday!
5432 2018-12-15 19:54:17 Our paper was accepted today - “Can sea urchin grazing of kelp forests in the Arctic make rocky shore systems more vulnerable to oil spills?” @ninam_jorgensen
5433 2018-12-15 19:54:13 This, so much. Plus, we're completely ignoring that other parts of the world - increasingly more and more countries - are moving away from oil and gas. How many countries will no longer allow gas-fueled vehicles? Who's going to buy our oil twenty years from now? In fifty years?
5434 2018-12-15 19:54:09 Oh, there's more. I was just focusing on the environment. He also killed SB775, the cap and trade bill supported by 50 environmental justice organizations, in favor of AB398, the one he wrote with the oil companies.
5435 2018-12-15 19:54:06 What are u gonna do, if I don't do away with exposing ur sublime misogyny other than send back anoda tweet or block me? Oh I'm scared . Meanwhile you lost all rights to my civility when you called me OLOSHO. Quit pretending! Let d inner yaba boy in u shine!! #MarketMarchYaba
5436 2018-12-15 19:54:04 Are u on @khamenei_ir's payroll too? Damn we need to pump more oil. Too many mouths to feed.
5437 2018-12-15 19:53:52 A few weeks ago, I saw the single worst example of crypto snake oil that I've ever seen. My head is still reeling. The claims:

* Unbreakable encryption (of course)
* Proof of work, but with no scaling limits! Magic!
* Docker-AI-quantum computer-proof smart contracts. 
5438 2018-12-15 19:53:48 Guy I be Lagos boy born n bred, I know yaba wella, that's not d only market ppl hold your hands to patronize them, even super, in agege it's the same.
All I was saying is that approach is wrong, sensitization is the way forward in a very civil and convincing manner.
5439 2018-12-15 19:53:40 Bout oil these legs up extra good tonight
5440 2018-12-15 19:53:27 Highest ethical standards? FFS, who is being self-righteous now? Environmentalists have a different take.

QC buys oil from cheapest source like everyone in the free world.

QC doesn't "take" any of your $. QC receives neg. share from Ottawa. Keep bashing & you isolate even more.

5444 2018-12-15 19:53:06 Trump likes to WIN.”Q” mindset is a crippling pacifier. It is interesting,though,in a strange,Pavlovian,snake oil sort of way. It’s similar to techniques used by the Left’s Louise Mensch.
5445 2018-12-15 19:52:30 Can someone bring me CBD oil for my foot?
5446 2018-12-15 19:52:10 WE’RE EXPORTING IT. That’s what the Keystone Pipeline is for: To move oil to the gulf for EXPORT.

5452 2018-12-15 19:51:47 The Alta government thinks BC should be happy with $25 million p/yr for the TMX pipeline, putting at risk the $15 billion per year we get from tourism in BC. Inadequate compensation for the risk involved. Alta won’t clean up the tar sands never mind a oil spill in BC.
5453 2018-12-15 19:51:36 We bin get plenty mad people for this twitter o. Sigh
5454 2018-12-15 19:51:32 Paying subsidy after removing subsidy is to ensure the price of PMS in Nigerian remain at N145/ltr, as the price of crude oil rises, price of Petrol should increase,  just like AGO, petrol has not been fully deregulated. If not be ready to pay 250/LTS
5455 2018-12-15 19:51:20 In the long run, the industry is drying up though. The global price of oil is controlled by countries with the lowest marginal cost to produce it and there may be enough low cost supply to remove AB from the market. That’s economics, not politics.
5456 2018-12-15 19:51:19 #BestPresidentEver has for thr first time in 75 years caused the USA to become an oil exporter #MAGA and #KAG. This is GREAT for our citizens because it is great for our economy. People come first.
5457 2018-12-15 19:51:15 Which lobbying group is Paul Ryan heading to? Israeli terror lobby? Big oil lobby? Big pharma lobby?
5458 2018-12-15 19:51:02 Coconut oil is the truth.
5459 2018-12-15 19:50:59 Yes. But why bother with the cereal? I mix in coconut oil and a packet of sweetener and toss it in the microwave for 30 seconds. It tastes like warm coconut ice cream.
5460 2018-12-15 19:50:59 I’m really giving myself a hot oil treatment, it was so necessary
5461 2018-12-15 19:50:57 Strange how they suddenly had no idea that they were insulting anyone. People who worked for oil & gas, products produced by oil & gas & coal. WOW time we looked at saying “thanks Oil “, Gas & Coal for all you make and make possible. 
5462 2018-12-15 19:50:54 Pipelines are the most economically proficient way to transport oil.  I'm sure you would not want them using oil tankers in the Great Lakes and trucking it is cost prohibitive.  What is your alternative solution to the proposed concrete tunnel?
5463 2018-12-15 19:50:48 Can Nigerians afford to buy fuel if subsidy is fully removed? Can Nigerians handle the inflation? Is Nigeria the only one subsidizing fuel or any other resource for that matter if that’s the concern? Cc Saudi Arabia another oil producer; America who subsidized agriculture etc.
5464 2018-12-15 19:50:45 Explain this to the Oil & Gas Industry.
5465 2018-12-15 19:50:37 Zafar does a Series bomb blast in Oil mine where All get stuck .Aladdin,Jinu & Yasmine r trying right now 2 save them.Omar knows Ruksaar is alive as He sees her in Oil mine .Yasmine too will know that Aladdin loves Shezadi Yasmine.AlaSmine r very good friends now.
5466 2018-12-15 19:50:34 You don’t get it. The more we produce our own oil, the less dependent we are on foreign oil. So it is a good thing for us. Are you that dense?
5467 2018-12-15 19:50:24 Who in the hell decided these two women had any credence? Salt and Pepper, Vinegar and Oil, whatever, No Sense and Nonsense!
5468 2018-12-15 19:50:14 Bedt people he was a swamp dweller! How much money did he make letting the epa to be destroyed? Like drinking oil filled water!?
5469 2018-12-15 19:49:49 Not just that. We refuse to accept that the booms and busts of the oil business are not the fault of the rest of Canada. The Notley and Trudeau killing the oil industry lines wouldn't play so well if we took responsibility. They are bending over backwards, far more than any con
5470 2018-12-15 19:49:42 Oh yes, Zinke's leaving after the usual corruption found in all your appointees & after giving away half the nationally protected lands to your greedy fossil fuel (that gas & oil Donald) friends.
5471 2018-12-15 19:49:35 And leaves interior in a shambles - opening park lands to oil exploration, reducing the size of national monuments...using interior as his own little playground. Hes truly the definition of the corruption rampant in the trump administration
5472 2018-12-15 19:49:33 Do you know why AB has the highest per capita income in the country? It's because of a few things, the oil and gas economy,  AB has had a tax structure that has promoted growth, we've had the least government interference in the private sector. All these are being destroyed.
5473 2018-12-15 19:49:32 Be sincere to yourself, after watching all the videos up there, if you were to be sensitized with that approach, will u respond positively?
5474 2018-12-15 19:49:31 Shout out to you two for keeping it civil. 

These guys that touched her are known for that bs, even if you’re a guy they’d literally hold your hands just so you’d look at there wears, it can be irritating

5477 2018-12-15 19:48:59 They are following Trudeau’s agenda. Phase out TAR production. Actually technology has advanced so mining oil is old school. Terrible twist of fate for Alberta but what can be done? No pipelines. No Tar. No nothing. Albertans will be wearing sawed off barrels for trousers soon.
5478 2018-12-15 19:48:53 While they were spouting lies as Assurances to get the undiscerning to vote for them. Sadly all some people need to see is one of their own kind in suit, boot and a tie, +a smile while declaring themselves as the people’s best pal and boom! They are sold. Snake oil my friends ..
5479 2018-12-15 19:48:52 What does the nra babe to do with parks or oil?
5480 2018-12-15 19:48:45 ... are now comparing us with China, as if China start development 3+yrs ago.

or was China not in existence in there 16yrs of jamboree, looting and wastefulness. All had was our unrefined crude oil & people with private jets gallivanting & looting around town. Sad

5487 2018-12-15 19:48:12 It was for that guy. He’s a City fan, of course he’ll mock Liverpool despite the fact that even with all that dirty oil money pumped into the club, they still haven’t made it to a Champions League Final. 
5488 2018-12-15 19:48:11 Ok, have we learned our lesson? There are two areas of the private sector we should never, and I mean never pull candidates for the presidency from...Real Estate and Oil. The most corrupt areas of commerce out there. It’s like asking for a crook to run your country.
5489 2018-12-15 19:47:51 Their debt is hardly the worst. They have assets and a dividend to cut if the worst case scenario were to happen. I believe they will surprise next Q. I like VET, 50% Brent weighted and getting European gas pricing. 
Aa for a heavy oil name, CVE would be the top pick.
5490 2018-12-15 19:47:37 No she won't.  Until Obama dems were all for walls, fences, changing laws to disincentivise illegal immigration. Since Trump it's all about resisting. Our policies entice and bait these ppl in and open border leftist  orgs help to organize this border assault
5491 2018-12-15 19:47:36 The oil stayin in the ground?
5492 2018-12-15 19:47:26 My dad just told me he was “so proud of me for getting my oil changed.” Who knew this was all it took to make him proud?? 
5493 2018-12-15 19:47:21 I think even worse would be foreign ownership that in search of profitability- cuts down and recycles from the main platform. I don’t hear crying about oil subsidies tho.
5494 2018-12-15 19:47:11 Pls respect yourself and do away with my mentions , I didn't engage you after discovering how uncultured and ill mannered you are, you don't deserve a civil conversation, he that wants to know my view has bn replied with the most probable solution.
5495 2018-12-15 19:47:05 The Saudi’s didn’t become human rights monsters overnight. 

Hypocrites turning a blind eye to their egregious conduct, while selling them LAV’s, selling Canadian wheat or buying their oil has been going on for decades. 

Seems a bit hypocritical to make a fuss now. #cdnpoli
5496 2018-12-15 19:46:54 #cdnpoli So Quebec would rather pay full world oil prices to dictator despots in the middle east than 1/3 price for the lowest carbon immision oil on the planet. All the while dumping their raw sewage onto the St Lawrence due to lack of funds? Best interests of Quebec?

5498 2018-12-15 19:46:42 you cannot expect the world to change if the people who are trying to do it get disqualified as humans by some little bitches on this app - id rather have “cancelled” folk that are doing good things n helping, change the world than some snake oil salesmen in a suite and tie
5499 2018-12-15 19:46:39 I knew the oil wasn’t but bread is manufactured then I went down the manufactured rabbit hole 
5500 2018-12-15 19:46:26 try not suffer to much like i do
5501 2018-12-15 19:46:26 Oil & Vinegar Liberal
5502 2018-12-15 19:46:23 Oh, absolutely. Alberta's problems are largely self-made. Instead of diversifying and preparing for a future without oil and gas, we keep clinging to the past.
5503 2018-12-15 19:46:13 It's called EI, W. Reason why you don't know that is because you have no clue what regular people go through. Not my fault oil is volatile and you are too delicate to handle criticism. You speak for yourself and yourself only.
5504 2018-12-15 19:46:11 Yo this Alcorn St and A&T game is the highlight of my day rn while I wait on this oil change
5505 2018-12-15 19:46:08 many places around the world are losing oil production and Russia/KSA were pumping full capacity recently. Shale is the only real growth in the world. Without shale we would have a major shortage already.
5506 2018-12-15 19:45:58 depends on how bad. Warm bath and belly rubs - literally - or a bit of olive oil on the nose. I did the OO and he went about half an hour later.
5507 2018-12-15 19:45:56 “Nathan, there’s no way you can try EVERY stupid health product.”

“Hold my MCT oil.”
5508 2018-12-15 19:45:47 go to Marquette or Wisconsin - forget that snake oil salesman Calipari. You can get to the NBA at either in state school and get a top notch degree
5509 2018-12-15 19:45:44 Oil money is some of the oldest money in our country. They are the ones that will do anything to keep oil on top. I mean who wants to go broke but the effects it all has on other ppl aren’t a secret.
5510 2018-12-15 19:45:36 My hair is extremely thick and I hate it but it’s super frizzy and coarse without the oil
5511 2018-12-15 19:45:31 One more reason to support a #GreenNewDeal
We shouldn't be allied with KSA and we wouldn't be if it weren't for oil.
5512 2018-12-15 19:45:29 Should I get my oil changed or eat
5513 2018-12-15 19:45:28 So they say, but a month ago, the roughly 250 I figured were being suppressed miraculously appeared only to be sent back to Twitter purgatory last week.

...whatever they’re doing seems to change paths more times than a Liberal PM standing in between pro/anti oil rallies.

5514 2018-12-15 19:45:28 Tell me WHY Selma Honda wants me to spend $600 right now? I came for an oil change..... got me fucked up
5515 2018-12-15 19:45:21 Unless you have your great grandmama’s cast iron pans, you actually can wash them. Maybe not the dishwasher, but you can even use soap. However, put it on the stove on low heat to dry and rub a bit of oil in the bottom.
5516 2018-12-15 19:45:17 Shale isn't going to zero and doesn't need to go to zero. What needs to happen is Iran gets cut to zero and OPEC balances the market going forward. Shale will slow down if prices do not rise. They won't stop growing though and we need that oil growth.
5517 2018-12-15 19:45:11 I guess going route 1 and calling upon Turkey to remove all its occupying army and the RoC to follow with the dismandling of the National Guard is a leap too far for UCN right ... 
5518 2018-12-15 19:45:08 Idk the reason but I don't like the finish when I season cast iron with light oil,  less shiny and less non-stick
5519 2018-12-15 19:45:04 Give me a break. California doesn't even have to touch its oil and it STILL beats Texas.
5520 2018-12-15 19:45:02 I grew up with Miracle whip.  Now I use Miracle Whip + olive oil.  I will eat mayonnaise but it has an oily taste to me that is unpleasant.  IMO since they took out trans fats everything tastes different in a bad way.  I don't even like donuts anymore.

5524 2018-12-15 19:43:57 The "stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones"... Saudi Arabia is preparing itself for a future where oil won't be used to power means of transport anymore and they're right to do so.
5525 2018-12-15 19:43:54 Wait until the Colts fans see the number of Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil tomorrow.
5526 2018-12-15 19:43:38 The thousands of Saudi attacks on civilians are war crimes, but the U.S. has been locked in with the Saudis for over 50 years because of oil.

5531 2018-12-15 19:43:13 That probe, which is still ongoing, is examining whether a land deal Zinke struck with the chairman of oil services giant Halliburton in his hometown of Whitefish, Mont., constituted as a conflict of interest.

5533 2018-12-15 19:43:08 I’m with you Jake! Not to mention, for me it MUST be Hellman”s original. No other brand, no lite version, no olive oil infused. Just good, ole Hellman’s @Hellmanns 
5534 2018-12-15 19:42:45 Can they find anyone who cares about ENVIRONMENT rather than oil?

5538 2018-12-15 19:42:20 Meanwhile there has been several meeting from market leader to sensitized these boys on their evil acts. I've lived in yaba for 9 years. A your approach is nothing but bullshit. Cos they are not ignorant of what they do! #MarketMarchYaba
5539 2018-12-15 19:42:19 There’s a 30second ad for cooking oil before the video
5540 2018-12-15 19:42:19 The world needs a new 1m+ bpd of oil under normal circumstances. If one starts to price in a recession the numbers will change. This is why we fell so hard on Friday.
5541 2018-12-15 19:42:17 Anyway, it’s impressive. I’ve gotten many fluids out of babies, but never oil.
5542 2018-12-15 19:42:17  Allah kiyaye
5543 2018-12-15 19:42:14 If women were in charge of designing a car (just one make/model), we’d design one where you don’t have to get underneath the car to change the oil.

Think about it: it’s like having to get underneath a baby to change their diaper.

5546 2018-12-15 19:41:58 Never forget that Iran exists in its current state due to the CIA overthrowing their government during peacetime in 1953 because the Iranian Prime Minister wanted to nationalize their oil industry
5547 2018-12-15 19:41:58 One of the dumbest things I have ever done is rebel against my mum by not wearing oil on my hair cos I hated it so much
5548 2018-12-15 19:41:57 Most likely it's mostly oil prices. Taxes may have hurt a little.
5549 2018-12-15 19:41:52 Oil & Vinegar Not A Doctor.

This system doesn’t really work, does it?
5550 2018-12-15 19:41:47 Many oil companies work on 50 USD, yet only based on cash costs. This is very important to understand. In theory companies should pay their bills and add to equity (paying investors for their capital). Yet most companies are using the balance sheet for raising cash and burn it.
5551 2018-12-15 19:41:40 My dad fixed my car so looks like the old bird ain’t dead after all. New transmission and an oil change is all? Pft
5552 2018-12-15 19:41:36 But hey, the Cobell Settlement cleared the Bakken Oil Field from the clouded titles and land and water claims arising out of mismanagement of 2500 Native allotments so that big oil, ND and MT, and the GOP could prosper.  So there’s that.
5553 2018-12-15 19:41:23 Have these hands/fingers been dipped in some slimy oil?
5554 2018-12-15 19:41:21 OMG she trolled the WHOLE world on telling them that they are sitting on their hands while allowing countries (Like the United States of america) destroy it by giving the oil companies MILLIONS of dollars She should run the world Not our corrupt governments in our countries
5555 2018-12-15 19:41:18 Saudi  oil flows into Irving oil refineries period. Quebec gets 44%from Western Canada, 37% from USA, 11%from Algeria and the other 8% from other.
5556 2018-12-15 19:41:16 um, you’re favorite salad dressing is oil and vinegar ???
5557 2018-12-15 19:41:14 @UrHealthNut 
I Have An Amazing Salad Dressing That I Think U Might Love 
It's Olive Oil
Mustard
Salt And Pepper 
SunFlower And Pumpkin Seeds
Apple Cider Vinegar
And Some Honey 
You Need To Try This It Is The Best And I Think You'll Love It - It Last For A Few Days In The Fridge
5558 2018-12-15 19:41:04 If my baby isn’t here by next Friday then I’m gonna start sippin on castor oil n killing pineapples since my bf don’t be wantin to get busy
5559 2018-12-15 19:41:01 I feel bad for them, but nearly 300 died last year, we know of. Why? Because our policies entice them to trek across land that is deadly, and they have no idea how deadly it is.
The closer to 0% chance of illegal immigration we get, the less will try and die
5560 2018-12-15 19:40:57 Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. You are the cowards. You are just a scum of a society. You do not have a power in the world. We are the masters of the world. We have the money and the oil. You do not own a quarter of its wealth. We decide who we are.
5561 2018-12-15 19:40:54 He’s a criminal and a land-thief/raper. DoJ is investigating him. You can do better by Alaska by listening to the land & the people, not by the almighty oil $.
5562 2018-12-15 19:40:53 Yes for all the oil in Iraq.  Also D2R
5563 2018-12-15 19:40:47 That's....that's not how it works. That's not how anything works. But good for you trying to convince people that the problem of unethical foreign oil can be solved by unethical domestic oil. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5564 2018-12-15 19:40:41 Well it’s service to oil companies and prospectors that want our parks.  It service to you or me. 
5565 2018-12-15 19:40:40 My entire life I've watched this cycle repeat in Alberta. We go from chest thumping about how amazing we are in boom times, to giant temper tantrums when oil prices fall and blame the rest of Canada for our problems.
5566 2018-12-15 19:40:33 I'll say this a-fucking-gain: HOW is a US Congressional scumbag ( Nancy Pelosi, Peter King, "those people") going to stop me or anyone from buying olive oil from Italy and then telling everyone we know that we refused to buy it from Israel? How? #boycottisrael #bds
5567 2018-12-15 19:40:30 As for fox pelts, red foxes (of which the silver fox is a color morph of), are not threatened, and the incredibly small number harvested by indigenous ppl each year, again where the meat, oil, bones, and pelt are used, are not the issue.
5568 2018-12-15 19:40:25 Stop bullshitting! You that just called someone "Olosho" An oppressor does not get to dictate how the oppressed should react. And I put it to you again that you are not an inch different from those yaba boys. You will do worse if you found yourself in the market. #MarketMarchYaba
5569 2018-12-15 19:40:19 Went 6 months without an oil change. The outcome was not good I’m bad at adulting.
5570 2018-12-15 19:40:07 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
5571 2018-12-15 19:40:02 Grapeseed oil is also high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fats react with oxygen at high heat that should not be used for frying!
5572 2018-12-15 19:39:57 Por ser el dia del camionero me encaje, me quede sin gas Oil, no dormir la siesta y estoy cagado de calor.. Pero hice 2 viajes que es lo importante.. Saludos a los que estan tomando latas y en la playa
5573 2018-12-15 19:39:51 ร้องไห้ทุกครั้งที่สอบไม่ผ่าน เราเต็มที่แล้ว แต่ทำไมวะ ทำมไ
5574 2018-12-15 19:39:50 I know for a fact that over 90% of materials used in the oil and gas sector are brought into the country through Onne Port. Also, activities at PH city port has picked up considerably in the last 2 years
5575 2018-12-15 19:39:36 Had a great meeting with CBD Oil Manufacturer today. Our unique infuser method means that the taste is not effected  exciting developments ahead 
5576 2018-12-15 19:39:33 WHY ARE ANTS STILL GETTING IN MY CAR. GO AWAY THERE'S ONLY MOTOR OIL IN HERE
5577 2018-12-15 19:39:27 We have recently removed all palm oil products from are port folio
5578 2018-12-15 19:39:25 Wow, it’s sad to see fellow Canadians hating on Albertans - I guess u all walk everywhere, don’t use public roads, wear synthetic fibres , and make ur own clothes from scratch - because allllll depend on some aspect of oil and gas -
5579 2018-12-15 19:39:11 อยากจังง แต่จะผ่านไปให้ได้นะ
5580 2018-12-15 19:39:06 #Bill_morneau When you were in CALGARY you said the Federal government could do a better job promoting the Oil snd Gas sector. Is this how the Federal government intends to support the sector?
5581 2018-12-15 19:39:06 ACPM, Gas, Gasoline and Oil are: __________
5582 2018-12-15 19:38:56 จะเปิดเทอมละ 5555555 ลงให้หมดด ซ่อมแล้ว ซ่อมอีกกก อยากเจออาจารย์ติวเตอร์เข้มๆ มาอัดฉันที ใครๆก็ไม่ป่านตัวเน้
5583 2018-12-15 19:38:54 Oil?
5584 2018-12-15 19:38:43 Better yet, you can turn captured CO2 back into oil.
5585 2018-12-15 19:38:39 Is anyone else who used the Snapchat beard filter the other day now getting ads for beard oil? Or is that just me...
5586 2018-12-15 19:38:21 TCP helped to heal my helix piercing years ago, it’s been about 7 years and I’ve not had a problem since.
Maybe try diluting the tea tree oil first, it’ll take about 2 weeks for the bumps to go down if you use it daily
5587 2018-12-15 19:38:19 Lol just block the fool
5588 2018-12-15 19:38:13 And they have most oil reserve, that is why some races maybe smart than others
5589 2018-12-15 19:38:01 Kamal @Kmlisah
5590 2018-12-15 19:37:53 Wondering if this is a big reason for whole Russia-gate affair. Oil/energy interests in U.S.
5591 2018-12-15 19:37:51 Just used the lemongrass essential oil....I love love love it ....
I diffused it all over my sitting and dining room. 
5592 2018-12-15 19:37:40 Not sure if oil prices going down is a bad thing. House prices are rising, what assets are you talking about?
5593 2018-12-15 19:37:31 ถ้าเราเรียนแบบไม่ตกเลยสักเทอม ป่านนี้จบแล้ว นี่ตกแม่งอยู่ แล้วไงมันก็ต้องมาอีกเทอม ตกซ้ำมา2ปีละ กะวิจัยตัวร้าย รำคาญ อยากจบไวๆๆ
5594 2018-12-15 19:37:29 Really!?
Last time I checked climate talks have been ongoing for more than a decade and not a single thing has changed. Fossil fuels are still being burned and rich oil tycoons and countries are still making bank. Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!
#climate #ActOnClimate
5595 2018-12-15 19:37:20 Exactly! When oil activity is high: Feds back off! When oil prices tank: Feds, you better help! Do we want a national energy policy or not?!? I say this as a 30 year Albertan.
5596 2018-12-15 19:37:13 After all they've done to promote the oil industry, @IEA should be renamed IOA.
5597 2018-12-15 19:37:06 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
5598 2018-12-15 19:37:05 I’m telling you to do those coconut oil treatments 
5599 2018-12-15 19:37:02 And no interference from big oil bought politicians
5600 2018-12-15 19:36:57 On the real, if I eat another piece of breadfruit, I’m gonna turn into oil down smh
5601 2018-12-15 19:36:35 Bolivia has a nearly identical project as PSUV. You don't hear of these issues there, the only difference is the US hasn't imposed the same measures probably because of the lack of oil.
5602 2018-12-15 19:36:33 I use highest fat Millie’s wolfheart with a little salmon oil.
5603 2018-12-15 19:36:33 A lot of the oil boom money ends up going elsewhere as they cash out and go to BC or Phoenix or wherever.
5604 2018-12-15 19:36:29 Olive oil attitude
5605 2018-12-15 19:36:18 I gotta get my bmw back like asap bc if my ma think i’m paying for another high ass oil change for her car she got me messed up 
5606 2018-12-15 19:36:16 Oil and vinegar atheist? Sounds like a condition 
5607 2018-12-15 19:36:15 
5608 2018-12-15 19:36:14 After this half of I’m not buying shit. Well some small shit. And I’m buying my brother a half of some fire since he can’t smoke and makes oil out of it. He should be able to smoke soon tho.
5609 2018-12-15 19:36:09 Don’t fall for their trickery. It’s all motor oil.
5610 2018-12-15 19:36:00 The best art is all about risk. You only know who Picasso is because he stopped trying to do typical oil portraits.
5611 2018-12-15 19:35:59 Do you care to link me what brands you use on the salmon oil, rice bran oil, and the vitamins?
5612 2018-12-15 19:35:58 Gave myself a nice deep condition, hot oil treatment, and trim 
5613 2018-12-15 19:35:57 عجبك؟ 
5614 2018-12-15 19:35:57 I see oil white & Mary Berry  #StrictlyFinal
5615 2018-12-15 19:35:51 Oil change / Tire rotation taking a little 2 long ... 
UK game @ 5   
5616 2018-12-15 19:35:47 Can't wait to get home, wash my face, soak in my sunflower beauty oil, and SLEEP
5617 2018-12-15 19:35:46 Going to do a hot oil treatment today & fix this hair. It’s self love day folks! 
5618 2018-12-15 19:35:44  that's the only oil readily available for the Chinese
5619 2018-12-15 19:35:39 Aggravation, heartsick that he was elected when so many of us KNEW he is a vulgar snake oil salesman who’s only in it for himself; and that now he’s scorched our tender earth and people with his dangerous actions & policies. I grieve; deep anger.
5620 2018-12-15 19:35:29 "Then will the LORD be jealous for His land & pity His people. Yea, the LORD will answer & say unto His people "behold I will send you corn, & wine & oil & ye shall be satisfied therewith; & I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen" Joel 2 18-19
5621 2018-12-15 19:35:21 Norway has a tiny population and massive North Sea oil reserves - hardly surprising. Whilst being an incredibly ecologically sound country, it's economy is still heavily based on fossil fuels.
5622 2018-12-15 19:35:16 I’ve tried that and i think it’s aggressive on my skin. Tbh they get better and then worse and then better. But I’ve tried tea tree, mustard oil, tcp, salt water lol now I’ve just left it 
5623 2018-12-15 19:35:04 Lack of common sense is a nation accelerating the burning of coal, oil, and gas when science tells us that doing so is racing into climate Armageddon.
5624 2018-12-15 19:35:02 His deputy, Bernhardt= 8 yr 'shrewd legal oil & gas lobbyist, a DC insider. Stewardship of public lands & oceans is about to get worse. He was DOI lead in softening Endangered Species Act to allow more drilling. But he's not a NRA/Safari Intl ally...#BanTrophyHunting
5625 2018-12-15 19:34:58 Sanctions against individuals and the state, deflating oil prices, bans on certain exports and financial instruments to/for Venezuela, pressure on trading partners to do the same, financing violent opposition parties, same as in Chile in the 70s
5626 2018-12-15 19:34:30 in Archie:1941 pretty much, mr.lodge sells oil to the germans
5627 2018-12-15 19:34:20 Cooking oil
5628 2018-12-15 19:34:15 For me I'm a sucker for dark beers, the darker the better, I'm fond of frankencense or myrr or cypress oil, fucking love chocolate, and obsidian.
5629 2018-12-15 19:34:08 Talking about oil based pepper spray and combative and getting tased has me swEATIN YA’LL
5630 2018-12-15 19:33:49 Maybe Obama will negotiate a two-part 3.5 billion dollars deal for them like the one his administration secured for Natives after 1) the US mis-accounted dollars, but more importantly 2) oil companies etc stole oil, land, water, etc — worth at least 100 billion.
5631 2018-12-15 19:33:11 He did a lot of damage to our Parks & MONUMENTS, opening up oil drilling in protected areas. Sad.
5632 2018-12-15 19:33:03 They were lucky BP found them. Antelope Wells is only inhabited by a dozen or so BP. Nobody lives there. On the way to Lordsburg , 93 mi, two towns, Hachita, pop 40? Separ pop 0.
On foot, that part of the country will kill anyone. Lucky more didnt die.
5633 2018-12-15 19:33:00 Both levels of Govt have betrayed the oil industry in AB.

You elected a Premier that only recently flipped her platform based on the fiscal realities.

Not everyone in QC supports Trudeau, although understand LPC control all media in urban QC. 

I support the CAQ govt. QC 1st.
5634 2018-12-15 19:32:57 my mom, queen of the birchbox, just texted me to say she liked the kiehls cleansing oil so shes just getting me a whole bottle??? bless???
5635 2018-12-15 19:32:39 It's shocking  just told I'm paid n m agent coz I called out the lie

What oil is paying the Chinese nhai
5636 2018-12-15 19:32:26 Thank you Mark Cantrell for this wonderfully creative picture of Lior which I have proudly added next to the oil you painted of my home a number of years ago.
5637 2018-12-15 19:32:18 Do what the Texas people do. Drill for oil, into that pimple.
5638 2018-12-15 19:32:15 Seems to me that @BlaineHiggs told Quebec that they could move all the beer through NB they wanted - if Alberta can move oil through Quebec! Someone is trying hard to improve interprovincial trade & reduce barriers! @JustinTrudeau won't do ANYTHING to help the West & Oil & Gas!
5639 2018-12-15 19:32:14 Nah. Dish soap won’t hurt the actual seasoning at all.  Just avoid abrasives and you can clean like any other pan. Just heat and lightly oil when you’re done. 
5640 2018-12-15 19:32:09 Same with the mad hippie products.  My esthetician suggested straight grape seed oil on face and neck at night and rose water mist for hydration during the day.  Eye cream always makes my eyes burn, so none for me
5641 2018-12-15 19:32:08 Trump will be leasing the back yard for oil drilling.
5642 2018-12-15 19:32:08 Everybody need some bless oil and a good nights rest.
5643 2018-12-15 19:31:55 The grill is fired up and we are serving lunch over Sames Ford! And Santa is here! We are out here until 5pm - come by and join us! Free oil changes for new, unwrapped toy donations plus awesome giveaways from The Beach 96.5!
5644 2018-12-15 19:31:46 It helps that countries like Norway have a small population plus tons of oil wealth
5645 2018-12-15 19:31:44 I don't think you understand. Only 47% of the oil used is in transportation, heating, and electricity. The other 57% is used for other essential things such as medicine and in your phone. There is about a barrel of oil used in your Internet convenience.
5646 2018-12-15 19:31:37 Did you even read my tweet? Oil and gas is one of the biggest employers in Texas. A lot of people who work in oil and gas donated to his campaign. That doesn’t mean he took money from lobbyists.
5647 2018-12-15 19:31:30 Oil money
5648 2018-12-15 19:31:25 @SecretaryZinke  Who will sell Yosemite and our other national parks for oil & gas development once you are gone?  Have you ever been to a national park in your life?  It's pathetic to be so obsessed with money. @realDonaldTrump
5649 2018-12-15 19:31:15 Like, from an industrial process standpoint? Or like the end product itself? (Curios as someone who grew up using canola oil & seeing nearby farms growing it)
5650 2018-12-15 19:31:09 さっき起きてカプコンカップ見始めたけど、最初に目に入ったOil King vs ももちもさんも、NL vs 久保さんもすごい面白くて一気に目が覚めた
5651 2018-12-15 19:30:59 Oil & gas, since it's a transit country (Gasprom must pay transit fees). Putin need to 'cut the costs' as well. Less middlemen, the better.
5652 2018-12-15 19:30:52 If you're impressed by that, try finding video of making 100 ton SWL chain links for ship & oil rig anchors. 15cm diameter wire forged into 60cm links with cross-bar.
5653 2018-12-15 19:30:46 I just bought a cool new record  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
5654 2018-12-15 19:30:46 Whip together 9 oz dips with 2 quarts cereal. Add Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve over kale.
5655 2018-12-15 19:30:37 Chai you both are not nice
But shebi them get hair treatment oil him fit use na
5656 2018-12-15 19:30:34 Who gives a damn about Jason Chaffetz? He's out of the Congress, thank God, and likely selling snake oil somewhere in the Utah wilderness.
5657 2018-12-15 19:30:32 What kickbacks are you getting? Oh right. Oil, gas... when are the Russians arriving to mine the gold, silicone, etc? And what’s your cut?
5658 2018-12-15 19:30:31 Mr @Busisa74 hanzi you are diverting cooking oil to pay China to print our currency. Hanzi this the reason why we were experiencing cooking oil shortages. Mafuta arikuenda kuChina. The amount of people who are buying this nonsense is shocking esp Zimbos.
5659 2018-12-15 19:30:27 the distinction between hard mekabare and soft mekabare is that one emphasizes volunteering your vulnerability and one emphasizes spilling oil all over the floor and yourself as your vocal co-processors struggle to communicate the full extent of the damage to your systems.
5660 2018-12-15 19:30:17 Don't forget to check out my essential oil collection and see my political posts making fun of your beliefs.
5661 2018-12-15 19:30:13 Girl swear my car was about to blow up. I prob had no oil in mine 
5662 2018-12-15 19:30:11 More head oil
5663 2018-12-15 19:30:08 change oil
5664 2018-12-15 19:30:08 Other methods of obtaining oil from seeds uses sometimes toxic solvents. so you'll want to avoid those.
5665 2018-12-15 19:30:03 That Texas judge is on the same level of moral reprehensibility as Ted Cruz. I think fracking has resulted in the contamination of the water table in Texas with sociopath-inducing benzene derivatives. Too bad the EPA has been reduced to an oil industry lobbying organization.
5666 2018-12-15 19:30:03 The whole train smells like tea tree oil
5667 2018-12-15 19:29:46 My car needs an oil change idk probably get a new one
5668 2018-12-15 19:29:46 garrab some olive oil based soap for cleaning ur hair ya moe
5669 2018-12-15 19:29:44 Not interested. You know as well as I do that you can't guarantee the origin beyond doubt. Stop putting it in and I'll start buying. the vegans in my home are already going without any spreadable fats as they don't consider palm oil to be vegan.
5670 2018-12-15 19:29:43 Car Dealerships should offer beer and tacos while you wait to get your oil changed just saying
5671 2018-12-15 19:29:27 Canola oil is verifiably grody
5672 2018-12-15 19:29:18 cut the shampoo!!

5673 2018-12-15 19:29:15 The Sports are on while I’m getting my oil changed. 

I’m gonna try and follow along. 
Let’s see how long this lasts
5674 2018-12-15 19:29:10 @Bohecoindia Can you provide cannabis oil for pain management.
My parents is suffering from pain.
5675 2018-12-15 19:28:56 Also there is not a coordinated effort to educate all of the American citizens for jobs of tomorrow either through corrupt politics that interferes with free market (ie oil) and the crony gov”t that espouse those corporations! Need to be more like Deutschland!!!
5676 2018-12-15 19:28:52 @reploucorrea @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast

5679 2018-12-15 19:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 8 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.
 #ableg
5680 2018-12-15 19:28:31 And when he is released he faces years of community service while he fights fires in California, assists in flood relief and hurricane clean up, and spend years with indigenous people learning the true value of land. Oh and clean ducks after oil spills. Or so I would rule.
5681 2018-12-15 19:28:28 man,my bf bringing out the cream/oil.. candles all that..he about to give me a full top notch body massage 
5682 2018-12-15 19:28:13 Let me know how you go ! Some knuckle head serviced their Ag bike on my veranda and the timber has motor oil all over it.
5683 2018-12-15 19:28:11 Not for premium oil
5684 2018-12-15 19:28:07 Oil and Vinegar and Moved Away
5685 2018-12-15 19:28:05 Oil is not going away or will it ever soon.  Plant a tree to replace a lost one. Better then carbon tax
5686 2018-12-15 19:27:58 There is no appetite for western oil, only the money that comes from it, they should have separated
5687 2018-12-15 19:27:58 And O&G companies were using the same type of forecast. Oil prices extrapolated to follow the run-up to 1980 - hitting something like $100 in 1986, in 1986 dollars.

And we know that never happened (*world* oil prices) - in fact they cratered in 1986.
5688 2018-12-15 19:27:55 My room smells like fresh linen and baby powder from my oil diffuser

Clean!
5689 2018-12-15 19:27:54 Yep and MSNBC & others like them blame it all on @realDonaldTrump. While that snake oil salesman BHO wants to take credit for everything that's MAGA
5690 2018-12-15 19:27:46 I take oil of cannabis  close enough, right? Haha
5691 2018-12-15 19:27:45 I would guess that it would dissolve some sludge and varnish in a few minutes. If it doesn't clog any oil passages, you could flush it with Rislone then refill with oil. You could then drive it to your mechanic to see how much damage you've caused. He'll love you. 
5692 2018-12-15 19:27:39 i read all of the issues so far and it's GALAXY BRAIN level mr.lodge is a nazi sympathizer selling oil to the germans
5693 2018-12-15 19:27:31 Biblical prophecies coming to pass ... we need to put on our spotless garments and keep our oil lamps full !!
5694 2018-12-15 19:27:31 Revived infrastructure sector,sustained reforms in oil sector. Despite so much hostility from the deeply entrenched pernicious ecosystem it has been able to achieve a lot in short period of 4.7 years.its performance has certainly been stellar compared to 10 years of UPA rule
5695 2018-12-15 19:27:25 I used coconut oil on my face and got a zit the size of Mt Kilimanjaro . Switched to plain grape seed oil at night and it’s amazing.
5696 2018-12-15 19:27:12 These 120$ oil changes are catching up to me lmao
5697 2018-12-15 19:27:05 Bio oil worked wonders for me! I also use coconut  body butters and lotions :)
5698 2018-12-15 19:26:45 Can you find the pattern?
 
At Interior: Unethical Ryan Zinke Out. Oil Lobbyist In.

At EPA: Unethical Scott Pruitt Out. Coal Lobbyist In.

At HHS: Unethical Tom Price Out. Pharma Executive In.
 
In the Trump swamp, things are so bad they turn to lobbyists to cure ethical lapses.
5699 2018-12-15 19:26:45 Lyon is a team that is both a traditional strong house and doing well at the moment. PSG was my team until they got bought out by an oil magnate...and now it just feels wrong to support the dirty money. Before that, PSG was a real blue-collar team that was fun to support.

MISS, YOUR AT A MECHANIC. OF COURSE THEY CHARGE LABOR. WHO DO YOU THINK CHANGED YOUR OIL.

5706 2018-12-15 19:26:12 Bloody nonsense. Democracy must have a final people's vote to judge where this dismal process has taken us and whether our nation should impoverish itself chasing a worthless bottle of snake oil sold to us by shameless discredited charlatans and shysters like Hannan.

5709 2018-12-15 19:25:57 Mikes grandpa saw our beer bong and asked “what are they doing changing the oil?”
5710 2018-12-15 19:25:55 Is it not a shame that oil gives your zoo more than 90% of fx and you claim you now feed the world. Where is the fx from feeding the world? #zoonation

5716 2018-12-15 19:25:18 Beautiful Wouldn’t it be nice if our hard earned tax dollars went toward building green energy 4 healthy earth & people infrastructure-subsidies? Rather than money down the drain polluting, toxic expensive coal, oil, dangerous nuclear & fracking subsidies?
I think  so.

5727 2018-12-15 19:23:44 Amazing we still have any "Interior" left. But I'm sure you'll appoint someone even less honest to destroy the rest of it in order to turn a profit for AgriBusiness and Oil Companies.
5728 2018-12-15 19:23:40 But you are deviating from the subject matter, nobody is talking about rape here.
It's very simple, if I want to make you aware of something or change a norm, and I approach you violently that way without regard, you'll even do worse than them.

5730 2018-12-15 19:23:32 "more renewable than wind and solar" You think the world has a infinite amount of uranium. It has to be extracted from the Earth the same as oil and coal. The Sun may burn out in 4.5 billion years. Solar still a better choice and wind will be here for as long as the planet
5731 2018-12-15 19:23:21 Provided that government has to take a kiss on subsidised cylinders. It is a balanced move for more coverage of LPG connections but the prices have increased than MMS times despite of decrease in global oil prices

TODAY .because he wanted  me to fill out a vacation pass from his place of employment. A oil company. Wow .
5738 2018-12-15 19:22:31 I wash mine with soap , dry it, then wipe it down with a paper towel and a bit of neutral high smoke point oil (peanut or coconut or whatever I have kicking around)
5739 2018-12-15 19:22:30 why are YELLOW JACKETS on France about helping the poor and in Canada they're about helping Big Oil?
5740 2018-12-15 19:22:13 Solar also pollutes and so does hydro only different. Switching from oil cars to electric cars only switched pollution place; car production increase cancels effect of transition to electricity. We need to cut population within nature's capacity and waste less, recycle more.
5741 2018-12-15 19:22:11 Or AB could plan better, tax more appropriately, and understand that there’s not much Canada can do to protect the oil patch from boom and bust cycles. When oil was over $100 a barrel, AB was operating like a banana republic.

5746 2018-12-15 19:21:53 When MMS left a subsidised cylinder was 440₹, a subsidised cylinder today is 510₹ (despite of massive reduction of oil and gas prices over the years). Let alone the difference in prices of unsubsidized LPG which is far great.

•You don't speak for "almost everyone" in oil & gas
•Some environmentalists are extreme but no more than ABns who are in denial about past govs' hands in pipeline mishandling
•Extremes in both camps need to let moderates work

5773 2018-12-15 19:19:01 I’ve never heard of cbd oil. I am in the military so anything that will come up on a drug test is an automatic no for me.

5775 2018-12-15 19:18:54 @momochi212 playing Zeku is what inspired me to really play that character. He just won against Oil King using Zeku once again. My favorite player playing my favorite character. 
5776 2018-12-15 19:18:54 You wouldn't be twisting the truth a little would you Nathan, the Liberals supported energy East, "there is no support" means the oil industry can't make a profit from it. The fact that U don't understand that is probably why your party is so far behind in the polls.,
5777 2018-12-15 19:18:54 Never too early.  We just have to hope that after the Oil win the Pacific that Calgary hangs on to a wild card position

5783 2018-12-15 19:18:30 I live in a TX refinery town. Most oil employees I've known care more about having a steady paycheck than climate change. Even the floodwaters of Harvey didn't awaken them. When the chemical odor outside makes you want to gag, they say, "Smells like money to me!" Then they laugh.
5784 2018-12-15 19:18:30 Yes, selling lands that are national treasures to the oil and gas industry is quite an accomplishment.
5785 2018-12-15 19:18:21 I’ve decided to refer to the herb, oils, and incense spell components as kush, baby oil, and potpourri
5786 2018-12-15 19:18:18 If you didn’t catch it in time rub it down with oil set in a hot oven that’ll season it ( summer sun is better) for now that’ll do. Repeat 2x 
5787 2018-12-15 19:18:14 @ABDanielleSmith misleading listeners and readers.  Cpc negotiated current equalization formulas, she paid by dark $ to lie, play victim? Harper gave QC more trying to buy votes, ignored alb, ignored FN rights to reward pals working in oil like Gwyn whos wife helped cpc cheat
5788 2018-12-15 19:18:07 The oil price of today is not at the time of @GEJonathan that was the main reason of the protest   was because @GEJonathan made the announcement at the wrong time and it wasn't subsidy we needed then it was to repair our refineries
5789 2018-12-15 19:18:03 Peppermint oil! Diffuse it or rub it on your temples.
5790 2018-12-15 19:17:52 Oh Yes I stand by what I said Bro They do rape girls because I have a Charity that supports Survivors and yes all those Yaba agberos and Obalende touts that's thier area of expertise. They think it's thier ultimate right to sleep with whomever they wish to so yes they rape
5791 2018-12-15 19:17:44 My grandmother who looked like Golda Meir believed Hanukkah was about Israel's lack of oil. She said that was unfair and we should have kept the Sinai.

Anyway hey maybe you could get a spruce garland instead of an artificially scented candle, no? I mean Canada has trees, right?
5792 2018-12-15 19:17:26 Lmbooooo. He use to oil his feet to and I was like man ugghhhhhh what’s that about!

5796 2018-12-15 19:16:52 Wtf is happening at utd. 3 years for a player who has no legs left. This club needs oil money and a owner who is passionate about getting this club back to the top.
5797 2018-12-15 19:16:48 Hanzi Oil, isati yawanikwa ha ha. Printing is the easy part. We don't need China for that. A currency has to be backed by something of substance. This is a shallow conspiracy bruhh 
5798 2018-12-15 19:16:48 Yummy palm oil
5799 2018-12-15 19:16:40 also there's more to it than oil, Spain and France would not allow Scotland to join the EU because there are other political consequences to it to regions like Brittany and Catalonia
5800 2018-12-15 19:16:33 I think Climate Change & Peak Oil are similar.
Either can be fixed through technology.
The reason most think Clinate Change is a Hoax is political. Why allow China to increase their CO2 footprint until 2032 when they already burn 50.7% of the Coal consumed on the planet?!??
5801 2018-12-15 19:16:20 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
5802 2018-12-15 19:16:02 When Mexico gets as much oil as Canada... xD
5803 2018-12-15 19:15:59 I'd argue economic freedom and free markets have a higher correlation, although such factors might be difficult to quantify. Venezuela has plenty of cheap energy (oil) but it's no help to them due to their  economic policies of collectivism
5804 2018-12-15 19:15:59 You said and I quote
'These are the same men who rape and violate innocent girls and even children.' That's where the rape story came from.
5805 2018-12-15 19:15:57 Shea butter and coconut oil
5806 2018-12-15 19:15:50 so you didn't find the part where I supposedly explicitly said Ghana and Yemen were better off? Are you seeing things? I'm not sure if you know but oil isn't doing very well right now, it's hugely volatile and declining so it won't do anything to help your black hole deficit
5807 2018-12-15 19:15:47 olive oil never call
5808 2018-12-15 19:15:46 Ha ha ha ha. Now at least you’ll have time to defend yourself against those allegations instead of selling off our land to your oil buddies. Enjoy the fluorescent court-room lights of your retirement dude.

5810 2018-12-15 19:15:38 @WCELaw having municipalities do your dirty work on Canadian oil is disgusting. If your office uses 0 oil products then you can start talking about the horrors of oil and gas
5811 2018-12-15 19:15:19 Grapeseed oil also contains significant amounts of vitamin E. One tablespoon provides 3.9 mg of vitamin E, which is 19% of the RDA
5812 2018-12-15 19:15:13 A oil and gas conference that was to be held in whistler was canceled due to this letter,since then the mayor has apologized. It seems several BC towns were encouraged to write these letters as part of an organized campaign put other by the west coast environmental law org.
5813 2018-12-15 19:15:11 I've had a canker sore for like 4 days now, and I asked my dad for something for it, and I shit you not this man pulled out an essential oil.

I never thought I would fight my father, but I think it needs to be done.
5814 2018-12-15 19:15:10 You must have slept during Obama’s 2 terms. Now that Trump is in charge, the oil and gas industry is BOOMING and so is my paychecks.

5816 2018-12-15 19:15:05 But didnt he want to open up pristine land to oil interests or are you okay with destroying your state and the environment, hmm just another Trump Domestic Terrorist Cult loyalist! Also supporting another crook!
5817 2018-12-15 19:15:00 Should read: "...until it was closed after oil was discovered in Scottish waters."
5818 2018-12-15 19:14:53 He is a quitter! You hate quitters! What oil/coal executive are you going to appoint next! Who will sell the gov land to their buddies! Fracking will harm this country for your grandchildren!
5819 2018-12-15 19:14:49 Tesla!

We go soon dey drink our oil.
5820 2018-12-15 19:14:39 3-0 lead late , you don’t get cute on. Your own blue line . Chip it by and get it deep . Let’s face it Draisaitl is a great player . However he has been playing Santa  with multiple turn overs a game . Great run by the Oil in an extremely tough 8 games in 14 days ....
5821 2018-12-15 19:14:27 There is an obvious hole in this discussion. What is the environmental cost of creating those fertilizers (often from oil) and shipping them?
5822 2018-12-15 19:14:27 So ... olive oil childless by choice?!
5823 2018-12-15 19:14:26 We are in Dubai for two days any one interested in crude oil light or medium heavy or investment in new refinery or in ores, rocks rich in gold ( 3-8 grams of gold per ton ) contact us or meet with our partner in Dubai now till Dec.17.2018.
5824 2018-12-15 19:14:03 it says oil is extracted from it. it means it existed already in India
5825 2018-12-15 19:14:02 If you watched the video very well I didn't hear anyone accuse anyone of rape! Not sure where yougot yoir own rape story from
5826 2018-12-15 19:13:49 He from the country and don’t know how to do oil changes 
5827 2018-12-15 19:13:47 Omg! IKR? I was going to ask how you took it? I mixed mine with olive oil but I’m still tasting it in my mouth an hour later 
5828 2018-12-15 19:13:41 Indeed, the only instance you nutters can find of a sceptic getting money in any way from oil companies - was because they were giving the money to the alarmist University who hadn't yet kicked out the sceptic.
5829 2018-12-15 19:13:36 They didn't riot it was a peaceful march until the men started shouting ashawo and touching them which is the exact same reason why they were marching in the first place! Each Man to his own that's the way they deemed fit to do it and there is noting wrong in it.
5830 2018-12-15 19:13:32 Adulting and getting my oil changed. My car been screaming at me for the past month to change the oil.
5831 2018-12-15 19:13:29 Some other oil Baron fixed in destroying our precious natural resources for the sake of a few extra dollars no doubt. Another corrupt and crazy Trump appointee who will be forced out by ethics and hooker allegations.
5832 2018-12-15 19:13:28 hada labo, hatomugi, bio oil, acnol sudah tu ajah sederhana banget. kadang maskeran cuma pake oat meal aja atau teh hijau
5833 2018-12-15 19:13:28 Heaven help us!  Oil & Gas lobbyist appointed to head Dept of Interior? Trump Administration has no shame! Talk about SWAMP!
5834 2018-12-15 19:13:23 Do these old ass white dudes who make all this money off of oil and block green initiatives from happening not want their grandkids to be able to live on a healthy planet?? Or do they just assume they’ll be on the first spaceship out?
5835 2018-12-15 19:13:21 i havre rosemary oil diffusing and it makes me want to braise a big ole pork chop
5836 2018-12-15 19:13:19 Their is a motor oil brand called Purple?
5837 2018-12-15 19:13:17 If I could interject...what if Liberals passed legislation to ban oil tankers in the St Lawrence? Qc would whine. What if Ont said to Qc we don’t want your hydro and the Federal govt said we agree there is no social license for your hydro. Qc would whine. AB only wants fairness
5838 2018-12-15 19:13:16 Don't misquote the Ojota protest it was all about subsidy but the protest was due to the fact that @GEJonathan increased the fuel price when there was oil boom in the world oil market. He didn't opposed the removal of subsidy he only said a minimal removal is what is needed now
5839 2018-12-15 19:13:12 He’s in his 70s I believe
5840 2018-12-15 19:13:11 Report to NM Senate caucus today is State more reliant than ever on revenue from oil and gas production. Any spin we've diversified economy with corporate tax cuts purely fiction. With permanent fund considered, near 45% revenue generated from that sole energy sector.
5841 2018-12-15 19:12:57 I liked as soon as you mentioned taste testing motor oil. I see you're a man of class as well. I prefer a nice 0w-30 with a brake fluid chaser and some boones for flavah
5842 2018-12-15 19:12:48 A complete pile of whiny, self pitying horse droppings. Hyper partisan politicians like Solberg continue to dine out on NEP narratives, and now conveniently place all the blame for a global crash in the price of oil on another convenient Trudeau. It’s AB’s little security blanky.
5843 2018-12-15 19:12:32 So the answer is - a lot.
Probably north of 2 tablespoons.
BUT I’m told that people need to build up a tolerance to MCT Oil.
(I don’t know a delicate way of saying it other than : don’t trust farts :-( )
I’ve never had an issue with it.
5844 2018-12-15 19:12:16 This is an oil and gas lobby account.
5845 2018-12-15 19:12:14 I think in the future water rights are going to be the next oil licenses
5846 2018-12-15 19:12:06 I’ve been meaning to check my oil and other fluids cuz my car hasn’t been happy but with all this rainy weather I haven’t been wanting to sucbeu
5847 2018-12-15 19:12:03 Why count subsidies in $ per person? Doesn’t the ranking then reflect the relative importance of fossile energy exstraction in the national economy, and not the relative subsidy level? And, what about Norway’s natural resource tax on oil (55%) in addition to corporate tax (23%)?
5848 2018-12-15 19:12:03 Hahaha,,, kuma akwai oil a bauchi fah..
Alkaleri,,,amma sam ya ki.@Ahmadlalar
5849 2018-12-15 19:11:56 That’s for oil wells because you don’t have a shutoff valve up stream!
In this case they should shut down the gas flow first, the fire will stop then.
5850 2018-12-15 19:11:55 I love tomatoes , in salads, sliced with just a drizzle of olive oil and a little salt or with slices of mozzarella, in a sandwich, in soup, in sauce... *yummy yummy* 
5851 2018-12-15 19:11:54 #sanwoluonhealthcare.We see agberos collect money on the roads & markets without providing any form of service to the populace.Y cant LAGS create a health insurance scheme like dt of UK's NHS via such grass root tax & frm our 13% oil derivation, to cover 50% of health charges atl
5852 2018-12-15 19:11:49 War monger @BillKristol and his war drum the @weeklystandard were the most pro Iraq war media outlet in the country. As a result the oil pipelines through Israel were turned back on dropping the oil prices dramatically. Bill Kristol is a citizen of Israel.

5853 2018-12-15 19:11:46 Oil workers just will not believe that the very source oftheir income are the very people fucking them they are so dumb but really greed leads
5854 2018-12-15 19:11:45 Shell and BP were amongst the early pushers of wind in the UK.

And I forget which but when I checked just one an oil company gave ~50million to academics most of whom are alarmists.

So they funded alarmists!
5855 2018-12-15 19:11:43 Continued oil and gas development, nuclear fusion technology, and electric vehicles. Greater energy independence. The US was already shifting toward an Asia focus pre-9/11.

5857 2018-12-15 19:11:29 He must be smoking the same shit the premier of Quebec was, glad to hear the oil companies canceled the meeting there, hopefully more people quit going there, the prices are ridiculous and then let’s watch him squeal.
5858 2018-12-15 19:11:25 You are a horrible person, a corrupt oil & gas stoogie, and @Interior is 100x worse off for your "service," Sir.
5859 2018-12-15 19:11:18 Did I mention, the fee is assessed on the company profiting from the dirty energy, at the source. So oil or gas well, mine, or port of entry.)
5860 2018-12-15 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5861 2018-12-15 19:11:12 Yes both are big GHG emitters but have you ever tried cleaning up a coal spill vs. an oil spill? Coal, from a cleanup perspective is the lesser of 2 evils.
5862 2018-12-15 19:11:08 That's not true. The world need 1.4Mb more oil in 2019. That growth has to come from somewhere. Keep in mind we are losing 1.5Mbpd from Iran in May. Everything was fine until Nov 5th waivers! Trump is the problem, not shale.
5863 2018-12-15 19:11:04 Why accusing them of rape when   you can't substantiate the claim? 
What I simply said is that the approach was wrong, they could hv called out on them in groups and talk to them , tell them what they're there fr, why its not appropriate to do so etc, not make it a riot.
5864 2018-12-15 19:10:58 Yes thats a nail strengthener the other is cuticle oil
5865 2018-12-15 19:10:49 Why are you angry? You decided to display your animalistic attributes by yourself on Twitter. Or you think it's humane to ask people to accept harrasment and molestation. I'm sure you are d offspring of 2 rabid baboons. Cos ur mind obviously doesn't function like that of a human

Something worth exploring I believe.

5887 2018-12-15 19:09:45 Progress that will erase 10s of thousands of jobs. Making the return on the oil industry even lower than it already is. Which was my point all along. The industry has no future that will benefit us.
5888 2018-12-15 19:09:25 Which oil guy will get the job? The current deputy, or someone worse?
Why don’t you shock us all and find your own Sally Jewell?
5889 2018-12-15 19:09:16 I'm with Greta Thunberg: leave the damned oil in the ground. Or we are all dead.
5890 2018-12-15 19:09:08 I prefer paying around $1/L and a Carbon tax on that, TYVM

5895 2018-12-15 19:08:48 ... palm oil, to make a fortune because palm oil is in damn near everything. So full circle these actions by humans directly effect our environment, which effect our climate. I don’t think the world is gonna end. I believe that we are extremely inefficient

5897 2018-12-15 19:08:46 QC doesn't have much of choice. "Dirty oil" from the West. Or "Bloody oil" from Saudi Arabia & Cr. Prince Bonesaw. QCers choose the cheapest option, until they're presented with a better option that serves QC.
5898 2018-12-15 19:08:44 Let the Rothschild's and Rockefeller's pay carbon taxes for the world they made all the money off oil .... Watch ... 
How big oil conquered the world & let them pay the bill
5899 2018-12-15 19:08:35 Would now be a good time to petition for one of the following: 1) some sort of bigger refinery/canteen to generate more oil or 2) let the oil filter accessory actually reduce oil consumption on the ship it's equipped to?
5900 2018-12-15 19:08:16 "Crude Oil May See Light in Tunnel As Oncoming Train" Despite seemingly good news to support the broad demand picture, crude has only moved sideways after falling 33% from the early October high leading traders to wonder if more pain is on the way.
5901 2018-12-15 19:08:16 So, I think the next step in my journey of health is changing my vitamin routine. So, after some research, I’m going to start taking @ritual vitamins, and I think I’m going to add @RosebudCBD oil into my daily routine.

Too bad you cannot escape investigation, eventual indictments and hopefully prosecution for being unethical.  
Too bad we can't get back some of the public land you were able to set aside for your friends in mining and oil & gas industry.
5907 2018-12-15 19:07:35 Paul does CBD oil register? The THC (high) has been removed & many persons use same for chronic pain etc.
5908 2018-12-15 19:07:31 There should be lawsuits - people should start analyzing the produce. You'd never guess to look for oil residues - and an emulsifier, which is certainly not fit for consumption. How else does oil dissolve in water?
5909 2018-12-15 19:07:30 The village is waking up to the lies of climate change. Stop using all oil and related products and then we can talk.

If you think an educated oil rich country like Scotland wouldn't be welcomed by the EU you're a bit of a div.
5917 2018-12-15 19:07:03 If US shale keeps on expanding output the price of oil will probably keep on moving lower.
5918 2018-12-15 19:06:58 If you’re older than 25 and work at oil and gas for an extended period of time, it usually means you’re a cuck and a anti-environmentalist.

5924 2018-12-15 19:06:25 I try to avoid recommending specific brands, because it just makes it easier for people to accuse me of hawking snake oil.

5929 2018-12-15 19:05:37 Alas, it isn't just oil and tobacco who do this kind of thing.

These are the same men who rape and violate innocent girls and even children.
5931 2018-12-15 19:05:29 Because white ppl of Italian decent usually go off on a rant “I’m not white, I’m Italian!!!” 

So they just mayo made with olive oil, a bit different but basically the same 
5932 2018-12-15 19:05:28 @RealJayParker1 Great show today Jay.Imagine all the plastics we could pull out of the ocean alone,to convert back to oil to use again,and clean the ocean+ecosystem at the same time,at the same time push new hemp based plastics.
5933 2018-12-15 19:05:23 LOL......I figured it was the only place you could go that would have Tim Tams on one end cap and olive oil on the next one.

5935 2018-12-15 19:05:14 If everyone would open their eyes and see the bigger picture I think many would agree. Oil is part of the world, it will be processed somewhere else if not here. So it may as well be done here with a smaller environmental impact than some other country.
5936 2018-12-15 19:05:09 10 Kg mince will be about K450, 100 fantas K600, 15 liters oil just under 300 etc

5948 2018-12-15 19:03:51 Because as far as I am concerned with the behaviours displayed by this lot these are the people who need it.

5952 2018-12-15 19:03:33 So I found my old.. Old.. Ooolllld... Oil pastels... 

I wonder..
5953 2018-12-15 19:03:28 se eu fizer oil pulling a maçã do meu rosto fica igual a da kendall jenner ?
5954 2018-12-15 19:03:26 Yes.     It bothers me a lot that we import oil from Saudi Arabia.    We should be oil self sufficient from both a resource and refining perspective.
5955 2018-12-15 19:03:20 Hay noche, hay fuel oíl disco. 
5956 2018-12-15 19:03:18 Whistler is just a dirty oil ski resort! Hypocrites! #alberta
5957 2018-12-15 19:03:10 Always beard oil, even now use it, helps encourage growth and keeps it growing nicely in good condition. When it was longer had a beard controller substance as well, helps shape it.

5960 2018-12-15 19:02:59 I'm going BACK TO THE FUTURE ...because the past is behind us...The Future is the Oilers back in Houston because they never left our Hearts and our Minds.  The buried emotion we have for them underneath our City is about to explode!  Oil always Rises!
5961 2018-12-15 19:02:56 I don’t know, teddy Roosevelt wanted to break up company, not a fan of the oil and steel industry??
5962 2018-12-15 19:02:50 I don't see why energy & specifically fossile fuels are not considered national security concerns. High oil prices hurt our economy & enrich antiAmerican countries. The economy of those countries are dependent on high oil prices. Green energy & low oil prices = win/win for the US
5963 2018-12-15 19:02:49 This is indeed shameful...
Calling young girls prostitites just because they said don't touch us!
Just because they asking men to keep their hands to themselves 
Charity they said begins at home
I would really love to know where you want them to have this session @oil_shaeikh
5964 2018-12-15 19:02:42 Obviously, #Zinke was not serving the American people - he was serving the oil & gad industry, a complete violation of any oath he took. #Corruption must be rooted out - and penalized. @NancyPelosi
5965 2018-12-15 19:02:37 Tell me why I’m at woodmans to get an oil change.. and these mfs In here acting like I stole my car.
5966 2018-12-15 19:02:26 Had to go get my oil changed
5967 2018-12-15 19:02:25 Crude oil prices: At this point, fears of US yield curve inversion and trade tensions between the world’s largest economies have sent 2019 rate hike bets dwindling. Looking at Fed funds futures, the chances of a subsequent hike after December are only at 27.7% in March.
5968 2018-12-15 19:02:16 Lool Baba no fit clear Atiku doubt
5969 2018-12-15 19:02:14 I had a brand new lip gloss that did this, with the oil separating. Oil almost always separates from other ingredients, even in foods.
5970 2018-12-15 19:02:09 Well read my tweet with an open mind.
5971 2018-12-15 19:02:07 People like me,  I think,  only talk sense. We don't joke. We're not fit for your world.  We're  happier mixing with "us people" in a clear and present harmful warning. The oil rigs,  nuclear plants etc...
5972 2018-12-15 19:02:06 i’m sorry baby get better and take some cbd oil!!!!
5973 2018-12-15 19:01:57 la reine rouge et son sale caractère...
5974 2018-12-15 19:01:56 @jeremycorbyn A second Referendum as @AmberRuddHR  is seeking would result in SNP demanding a new vote on the same basis that time and things have changed. This would end bad for UK and the Labour party and break up the UK Oil and Whiskey going sky high. We'd be a joke Worldwide.
5975 2018-12-15 19:01:52 QC cannot unilaterally veto, true; however, they could be an ally for getting any project done.

Trudeau & the Feds could make this happen, but there are too many in the LPC that want this oil kept in the ground & want AB to "transition" from oil.

QC has some pipelines already.
5976 2018-12-15 19:01:52 Nigerians are praying that INEC shld be as neutral as possible so that PDP can sweep d polls as all APC’s propaganda machine oil has gone dried in dia engine. Osinbajo made d mistake of his life when he carelessly mentioned “corruption “which is their usual slogan and was shut up
5977 2018-12-15 19:01:50 Need to schedule some time to oil my biceps
5978 2018-12-15 19:01:48 I was losing my hair a few years back & I would use a mixture of coconut oil & avocado oil after a bath at least once a week. It helped my hair grow and helped with the breakage. You could also try Castro oil mixed with coconut oil and aloe vera I used that on my eyebrows.
5979 2018-12-15 19:01:45 hm. it seems oil paint is very dangerous and i should have had a window open when i was actually using it instead of opening one as an after thought. hm.
5980 2018-12-15 19:01:44 Instead of telling the truth about Alberta oil and years of mis management of the economy, she chooses to blame everyone else.. It's not a good look, she cries the blues when people are ugly towards her but she is no better and participates in the same ugly language,
5981 2018-12-15 19:01:39 Hermes are wonderful! A favourite place is a bucket in the toolshed,sometimes on an oil drum, and once with our neighbours cows.
5982 2018-12-15 19:01:39 お疲れ様ー(ФωФ)たのしかったなー
5983 2018-12-15 19:01:32 If it's really and truly stuck on, you can wash it, but you will have to re-season it before using it again. I can almost always get stuff to come off, it just might take a few rounds of scrubbing. You only need to worry about the food particles because it likes oil and grease.

5987 2018-12-15 19:01:10 So you really think this is a stunt! 
Big Sigh

So Market people shouldn't know that it's not alright to touch a Lady inappropriately....
These are the same Market Agbeei boys raping children up and down the place!
5988 2018-12-15 19:01:08 He has accomplished much to destroy more public land, let oil and gas companies get more access to public land, asked representatives from these same companies serve on councils, and, like you let's money & power dictate his decisions and dismisses climate change.
5989 2018-12-15 19:00:58 My sister drank pure castor oil I am sickened
5990 2018-12-15 19:00:48 #DidYouKnow half a barrel of crude oil is used to make one truck tyre #wickford
5991 2018-12-15 19:00:41 children should secrete canola oil if an erect penis is in their vacinity. for escape purposes and to avoid being grabbed. that's my opinion.
5992 2018-12-15 19:00:36 Given that crude oil is largely priced in US Dollars, the tone for crude oil could be set by how the central bank impacts the greenback and broad sentiment.
5993 2018-12-15 19:00:35 Thieves essential oil is my savior what I’m sick! 
5994 2018-12-15 19:00:26 let's go OIL KING the legend
5995 2018-12-15 19:00:25 I also forgot to mention I've taken cbd oil for I'd say a month now, I do see more of a difference in my sleep. Mine doesn't contain any thc.
5996 2018-12-15 19:00:22 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5997 2018-12-15 19:00:22 House tonight. And it's no way of determining where we stand on the walls with coconut oil, yeah.
5998 2018-12-15 19:00:21 I didn't know you owned a pizzeria also. Which was easier to start...pizzeria or oil change biz? #curious

6000 2018-12-15 18:59:51 Only about 3,000 miles overdue for an oil change so I can’t wait for Jiffy Lube to scold me  #ImBusyOk
6001 2018-12-15 18:59:51 Telling, since the Chinese are way ahead in green tech and conservation, while the US clings to its oil empire.
6002 2018-12-15 18:59:43 I just did my daily!  And took my saffron and fish oil. Doing good Miya!
6003 2018-12-15 18:59:42 Walnuts taste like the smell of dirt but with a mouth feel of crunchy oil that coats the roof of your mouth. Same with cashews but they’re weirdly kind of sweeter? Almonds are the dry white wine of nuts. You bite down and it’s like why is my mouth so dry?!
6004 2018-12-15 18:59:37 no matter how much i dilute my tea tree oil my face still smells like it and it’s so sTRONG
6005 2018-12-15 18:59:35 I don't know much about this area and I think it was possibly you who told me to avoid palm oil initially! :-) if I see palm oil in the ingredients should I avoid or not?
6006 2018-12-15 18:59:32 Burned my arm/hand at work and i have 2 very important questions.....How did my arm hairs survive the oil spalsh and are my freckles gonna grow back? 
6007 2018-12-15 18:59:29 Just get some coconut oil and make a sugar scrub at home. They're are recipes all over for it. My friend made some for me once, it was great. I went and bought a scrub from Lush, but I'll just make my own from now on.
6008 2018-12-15 18:59:29 I put my weed in apple juice for 2 weeks then let it set in the fridge until it’s oil
6009 2018-12-15 18:59:23 Ateh oil guy??
6010 2018-12-15 18:59:16 Hard to pretend something you've never had.

Ever pretended you liked something just to impress someone? 

I pretended to love cooking to impress my mom. Then when she asked me to pass the virgin oil, I made a joke about my virginity. Then mom laughed at me for being a virgin.
6011 2018-12-15 18:59:16 Pinche Rob! Jajaja se la hubieras pedido también a Oil King Jajajaja pobre vato
6012 2018-12-15 18:59:15 Did he remind Quebec about the oil tankers cruising up the St. Lawrence to deliver foreign oil to the Quebec refineries. Did he tell them they have a lot of nerve denying a pipeline through Quebec.?
6013 2018-12-15 18:59:12 Take over would only happen if oil was found in Tannadice.
6014 2018-12-15 18:59:02 넹 존버 타겠읍니다
6015 2018-12-15 18:59:01 I don't think so, my youngins are still grade school. My understanding is it's not offered.

We really should have a practical life skills class like, cook hotdogs & ramen, change oil in a car, wash laundry, budget, change out a light fixture, etc. The stuff our parents taught.
6016 2018-12-15 18:58:56 Sana oil
6017 2018-12-15 18:58:56 Someday when I'm housed, I'm contemplating making my own cannabis-infused butter, or organic coconut oil, which then can then be discretely used in/on foods as needed.
6018 2018-12-15 18:58:51 Quebec is the useful idiot that allows his anti Canadian oil policy to continue. That, and Quebec is his only hope of political survival
6019 2018-12-15 18:58:47 You're MAD
6020 2018-12-15 18:58:47 If the answer is QC, you don't. They don't decide the portion or pay out the money.

You're blaming a child for getting more allowance money. You hypocrites would do exactly the same in QC's place. 

Blame the Federal Govt who is responsible for spending & mismanagement of AB oil
6021 2018-12-15 18:58:44 butter->margarine
While debates on the health benefits of butter versus margarine often bring up the various additives in margarine, by buying a good quality, olive oil spread and using it when baking, you can make your cupcakes light as air as well as being a bit healthier.
6022 2018-12-15 18:58:42 Still, a report from the International Energy Agency last week offered potential prospects for higher oil prices down the road. According to the IEA, supply losses from Iran and Venezuela could underpin pledges from OPEC to reduce output.
6023 2018-12-15 18:58:41 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
6024 2018-12-15 18:58:04 Oil Tycoons like Leicester...
6025 2018-12-15 18:58:02 I was young when the Oliver North shit was happening...this amount of high treason and greed masked as American patriotism to sell oil and guns by @realDonaldTrump and those that control him make that look like ginger beer man. It's past time citizens took over for a bit!
6026 2018-12-15 18:57:54 He was busy telling lies as usual. He said NNPC is now the sole importer of petroleum products so how come they are owing oil marketers 800billions?
6027 2018-12-15 18:57:50 Beto decided that this would take the focus off his sleazy oil & gas donations and the environmental criminals to whom his political life is beholden
6028 2018-12-15 18:57:47 Oil changes shouldn’t be this expensive.
6029 2018-12-15 18:57:39 And illegal dictators like Putin. As Russia supplies only oil and gas - and never had a thriving agriculture, pharmaceutical or general manufacturing base Putin must be rubbing his hands in glee to get control of the USA!
6030 2018-12-15 18:57:36 Fake news. What oil in Zimbabwe. Get real
6031 2018-12-15 18:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
6032 2018-12-15 18:57:32 힝 그렇습니까..아깝네유ㅠ
6033 2018-12-15 18:57:25 Nobody is advocating that they can’t what people are trying to say is that AT THIS POINT in time we don’t have the ability to completely live without oil. And that completely living oil free is not an option unless we go back to how things were before oil.
6034 2018-12-15 18:57:24 But we don’t have oil yet, maybe it’s cooking oil
6035 2018-12-15 18:57:20 Seriously, we need to build a refinery in Thunder Bay, so Alberta can send their oil here. Ontario and all the ports on the Great Lakes can use the product. #WINWIN

6040 2018-12-15 18:56:58 It wasn't the conservatives that gave free rein to Chinese companies in the oil sands of Alberta! It wasn't under the conservatives that Chinese money made housing in our main cities unaffordable for Canadians!
Canada has ZERO leverage over China thanks to the conservative party.
6041 2018-12-15 18:56:56 The rise in crude oil slowed as risk appetite took a turn for the worse following a very cautious ECB monetary policy announcement the central bank offered gloomy economic forecasts for the year ahead, then key Chinese industrial statistics slowed to their weakest pace since 2016
6042 2018-12-15 18:56:43 And this is what we need right here - right now.  Get people into it and yes talk about it . You have NO idea who else is already “in the community” until you bring it up - the 2 guys at my oil change place I found out are HUGE DCI fans - woulda never known till opened my mouth.
6043 2018-12-15 18:56:43 I’m very skeptical when it comes to cosmetics ingredients but I wanted to try the lip balm before maybe I should check out the body moisturizers too  I also want to try something with squalane oil the face... and maybe something with argan oil for the hair
6044 2018-12-15 18:56:29 I honestly don't think Trudeau wants pipelines, he said he can't phase out Canada's energy sector soon enough. Even though Canada has some of the best records at minimizing environmental impact when dealing with oil.
6045 2018-12-15 18:56:21 Did u say our economy is already diversified when even as we speak 90% of our revenue is still crude oil, the reason Buhari double as minister of petroleum, may be i don't understand u well.
6046 2018-12-15 18:56:14 보고싶어요..
6047 2018-12-15 18:56:01 Ryan Zinke was a putz. I am so glad he is gone. Appropriating US public land, set aside for hard working Americans, by Teddy Roosevelt, is an abomination. Aren't you glad Alaska is not drilling for oil. Just imagine what an earthquake would do if it struck offshore.
6048 2018-12-15 18:55:59 it's "Springsteen on Broadway" on Netflix Eve so be sure to leave out a plate of bandanas and a glass of motor oil tonight
6049 2018-12-15 18:55:52 Hi!  I was luck enough to win a Brodiak, is there a picture of that that I can have?
6050 2018-12-15 18:55:50 I get my dog these ones called pet releaf, and they’re suitable for cats too! You could also just sprinkle straight CBD oil on his food
6051 2018-12-15 18:55:49 Corporate by a long shot...I think it's like 8 Billion goes to Oil Companies alone...

Most expensive means tested welfare program, Medicaid, costs federal government 30 billion dollars a year or about half of the amount corporations receive each year through assorted tax breaks.
6052 2018-12-15 18:55:48 Legalization is rolling on; the process can't realistically be stopped. Cannabis Prohibition began 1938; glad trend is  reversing. I like vaping cannabis oil for rapid relief (much less harsh than smoking). I need about 100mg of THC, so many edibles are too expensive per dose.
6053 2018-12-15 18:55:40 GOOD! He is nothing more than an environmental terrorist who's egos so big he make his staff raise the flag outside his office everytime he's there! He promised he wldnt sell off our monuments to oil companies then sold millions of acres to them!!
6054 2018-12-15 18:55:40 We could sell oil and gas to other customers at world price if we had pipelines. By your own logic Alberta should shut down its industry and then collect money from Quebec and Ontario. Real productive!
6055 2018-12-15 18:55:35 I went down the “is argan oil sustainable” rabbit hole and the answer is “if they make it so, it will help Morocco push back climate change there, but you have to know whom you’re buying it from, and” then my environmental studies degree kicked in.
6056 2018-12-15 18:55:33 grape seed oil is very high in polyunsaturated fats, mainly omega-6.
6057 2018-12-15 18:55:27 There is a difference between not paying at all and not paying to phantom oil importers which was the order of the day pre-2015

6062 2018-12-15 18:55:12 Thank you very much.  I'll be alright I think, it's just my hearing that's not great, things are OK in other areas. Been given spray to help with the discharge in the right ear, oil drops for the wax in the left one and also antibiotics. Hopefully after a goodnight's sleep...
6063 2018-12-15 18:55:08 Thank you so much! Rosehip oil at night and a good moisturizer have been doing me wonders.
6064 2018-12-15 18:54:48 Then we have the shell oil and BP funding the renewbales lobbyists. And oil companies giving 100s of millions to academics.

Alarmists get 100s of millions from fossil fuel companies.
6065 2018-12-15 18:54:40 I use to live in Barnhart while working in the oil fields and did just fine... So you were saying?
6066 2018-12-15 18:54:37 I used Almond oil too!!!

6070 2018-12-15 18:54:22 The fatty acid composition of grapeseed oil is the following:

6084 2018-12-15 18:53:02 @woodintexas no such thing as a Christian conservative they are  opposite ends of spectrum. Like oil and water just like Trump is the opposite of Jesus in the bible if you read it you would know that.
6085 2018-12-15 18:53:02 He needs more attention. We could use a total of the land he has given away. It seems like up to 3.5 million acres so far.   There was at least one report of the plan being to give to oil and gas industries, 50 million acres, for pennies on the acre stolen from our grandchildren.

6088 2018-12-15 18:52:38 Somewhere, Chris Rea is checking his tyre pressure, topping up the oil and filling the screenwash bottle. ‘It’s nearly time’ he mouths silently to himself.
6089 2018-12-15 18:52:35 I'm with U... think the big OIL negativity is typical recency bias and ignoring some pretty big upside catalysts.   Thus $WLL and quite a few other names prob. primed Jan. Effect plays.

6094 2018-12-15 18:52:00 its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.
 Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US
6095 2018-12-15 18:51:53 I really hate getting an oil change 
6096 2018-12-15 18:51:44 Crude Oil prices head into last weeks of 2018 looking vulnerable, dominant downtrend holds
Supply disruption from Venezuela and OPEC output cuts may support prices in the near-term
Risks to prices including slowing global growth, more hawkish Fed and weaknesses in stocks.
6097 2018-12-15 18:51:42 Think this through. If QC is forced to develop its Anticosti oil/gas as a solution to AB's equalization hysteria, it would no longer need to purchase AB oil for its two refineries. Right now, one-half of QC receipts are AB oil via the US. Line 3 underway will reduce that.
6098 2018-12-15 18:51:42 @RMWhistler so the mayor has apologized to the oil and gas companies...when is he going to apologize to the residents of whistler he represents?
6099 2018-12-15 18:51:41 @MrsdogC check out gerson therapy.  Rick Simpson oil.  God bless
6100 2018-12-15 18:51:38 I have mixed feelings about the oil, as much as I'd like it to be a revenue I think it would be better for Canada and the environment if we processed it and shipped it's processed form instead of raw form.
6101 2018-12-15 18:51:34 To the nearest oil executive board meeting to take his bought seat.

6105 2018-12-15 18:51:00 When a team wins, they always look more comfortable playing in front of the guy in goal, lol. Confidence goes a long way and at the moment they have it. The interesting part will be to see how the collective reacts to their next slump, as it is coming.
6106 2018-12-15 18:50:57 Cooking with boiling oil for first time, kind of terrified
6107 2018-12-15 18:50:53 Toh no problem
6108 2018-12-15 18:50:44 Mga hayuufff kayo hahaha. Ang akin lang pag magpapamasahe magbigay kahit magkano kahit piso keri na. May pamahiin kase sila kapag nag mamasahe eh. Cooking oil amps hahahah. Dalhin ko na nga lagi yung oil na ginagamit ko pang masahe para if incase na magkakasama tayo. Shuta kayo
6109 2018-12-15 18:50:42 Faced with any problem that can't instantly be solved by more oil or tax cuts, and we're suddenly out of ideas. I've never really thought about it before, but this province has the combined problem solving ability of a bee stuck against a window.
6110 2018-12-15 18:50:36 US-China trade war, Italy's rising populism, Brexit, elections in emerging economies, US Congress' policy gridlock, oil, Asia's waterways, terrorism including cyber attacks.
6111 2018-12-15 18:50:30 Dayum y'all really oiled that burger up, nice shot though just reccomend putting less oil and *fake filling* because it is too obvious
6112 2018-12-15 18:50:26 The correct phrasing would be: “and the private plane owned by oil and gas executives that you flew-in on.”
6113 2018-12-15 18:50:22 “TRUFFLE OIL LOOSE GRIP ON REALITY” DOESNT HAVE A GREAT RING 2 IT BUT IS ALSO ON BRAND SO IDK
6114 2018-12-15 18:50:17 Also need a new loc oil and moisturizer. Any suggestions?
6115 2018-12-15 18:50:16 @realDonaldTrump  North Korean sanction violation fine 32% of oil value seized : to be contributed to the Red Cross  before oil is returned !
6116 2018-12-15 18:50:01 El @didierooo ya le pidió sus shorts a Oil King 
6117 2018-12-15 18:49:57 I got my Jeep Cherokee a couple yes ago from Murdock Hyundai. i think I’m a fan for life. Plus add on five bucks a month to your payment and you get “free” oil changes/car washes/check ups for like 5 years
6118 2018-12-15 18:49:55 Yeah ... Venezuela ... with all that oil revenue should have been a socialist paradise ... future vision of the UK if Corbyn and his Momentum crowd get power ...
6119 2018-12-15 18:49:55 Ready to be covered in cocoa butter and almond oil. Dry where?
6120 2018-12-15 18:49:54 Line 9 reversal has elbowed foreign oil from ON's refineries and cut back QC's refinery receipts. Line 3, which is now underway on the US side after a long court battle, will reduce QC's foreign oil receipts further. That leaves Irving, which never promised to refine EE oil.
6121 2018-12-15 18:49:53 Truth.  RT @RevDaniel: Rosemary and Olive Oil Triscuits are the best Triscuits.
6122 2018-12-15 18:49:52 Maps are helpful to know where you are actually going and give context to GPS. I genuinely miss them (. And since I left NJ I had to learn to pump gas again .... don’t miss filling the oil etc. from the hand me down 1977 Buick LeSabre I first drove.
6123 2018-12-15 18:49:52 As a devil's advocate...Since May, the world thought Iran would no longer be exporting oil on Nov 5th! Shale didn't cause prices to drop, Trump did with his waivers! OPEC is shale's best friend right about now and Trump is the enemy to shale and drillers worldwide.
6124 2018-12-15 18:49:34 What is the achievement of gov here? It totally depends on the international crude oil price
6125 2018-12-15 18:49:23 Bio oil and I never got a single one.
6126 2018-12-15 18:49:23 I'm not against pipelines, I'm against shipping the oil to other countries. Specially China.
6127 2018-12-15 18:49:12 Just letting people know what I read about the mineral oil especially in regard to the face. I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful. Whatever works. I have no opinion because I haven't tried. Just sharing. 
6128 2018-12-15 18:49:05 Olive oil  
You're welcome sweedy .
6129 2018-12-15 18:49:03 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
6130 2018-12-15 18:48:55 After drinking Olive oil & honey started speaking truth.
6131 2018-12-15 18:48:54 not-so-funny story but all I know about oil painting is thanks to the internet and some friends, so there are ofc some things i’m not aware of or just didn’t know about, like the fact that i have to wait at least 6 months before varnishing a painting :-))
6132 2018-12-15 18:48:53 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
6133 2018-12-15 18:48:50 But the Quebec welfare bums have no problem taking Alberta dirty oil money and burning Saudi Oil for there 6 million cars ad trucks
6134 2018-12-15 18:48:46 Dude, it costs you ~100-150 bucks to get the tools you need, and then ~30 in oil and materials each time from then on out.

Fuck what they say, unless the car is under warranty.
6135 2018-12-15 18:48:45 And more oil makes this better than renewable energy does?
6136 2018-12-15 18:48:43 "Thanks to tRump administration, #BigOil can move forward w this dangerous plan to allow seismic exploration 4 oil and gas in our ocean. And they have permission to knowingly harm over 30 species of marine life, incl sea turtles, fish, dolphins, & the North Atlantic right whale."
6137 2018-12-15 18:48:33 Getting oil changes in the city is fucking expensive.
6138 2018-12-15 18:48:23 Never said that once actually. But what I did say, if you want to destroy water, you can take what we already can’t drink. So build desalination, a pipe line to feed it to your tar sands, and then will see how badly people want you oil, THATS TRUE CAPITALISIM, yours is fake.
6139 2018-12-15 18:48:21 What oil in the frying pan?
6140 2018-12-15 18:48:18 The German–Soviet Commercial Agreement let to 900,000 tons of oil supplied to Nazi Germany in the period February 11, 1940 to February 11, 1941 - which was virtually all Germany's supply of oil at the time
6141 2018-12-15 18:48:15 I am not such as stastatician but I do know that the players relax with him in goal & we get a lot more wins.  No way should we have lost to Philly.  1 soft goal = tie.  Then snything can happen in OT.
6142 2018-12-15 18:48:13 Obatla ka olive oil or ka sunflower?  thank you 
6143 2018-12-15 18:48:10 Volatility in oil prices is only going to get worse
6144 2018-12-15 18:48:05 Don't quote me on this but I think it's Argan oil and shea butter.
6145 2018-12-15 18:47:46 Oil and Vinegar Pigheadedness

Noone makes it rain when I'm on
6146 2018-12-15 18:47:43 i was supposed to get an oil change 2.5 thousand miles ago so like i’m i gonna die
6147 2018-12-15 18:47:41 Yes, that is exactly it in a nutshell. I am always astounded by those that want oil & gas to be free to be in market how they choose....but balk when they make choices like not building at all.
6148 2018-12-15 18:47:33 Let's see..... the pipeline is to bring Alberta oil to the coast to ship abroad.    So you are against the pipeline?
6149 2018-12-15 18:47:29 I used too much coconut oil hair product today by accident and it looks like my hair is greasy, but it’s fabulously silky so whatever. 
6150 2018-12-15 18:47:26 Well, we trust you oil companies so much.  After all, you'd NEVER lie to us, huh?  
6151 2018-12-15 18:47:24 Nothing makes me happier today than hearing this.  They need to restore the protected lands he opened up to the oil corporations. Immediately.
6152 2018-12-15 18:47:24 Synthetic oil? I also chose the manufacturer filter #fancyAF
6153 2018-12-15 18:47:14 I mean, I remember having to check and fill the oil when I stopped to get gas. I don’t miss it tho
6154 2018-12-15 18:47:06 @realDonaldTrump  North Korea :  violating sanction :  Why hasn't the North Korean oil been seized with a 32% fine before returning the oil for sanction violation ?   32% Fine contributed to the Red Cross !
6155 2018-12-15 18:47:04 Avoid hemp seed oil?   I’ll assume your comment doesn’t apply here?
6156 2018-12-15 18:46:43 Putin did not help elect Trump. America is exporting oil at historic levels. Would you like to be paying $8 gal gas? That was BO goal thru Paris Agreement & regulation of energy business.
6157 2018-12-15 18:46:36 It is not going to end well for oil. Oil countries need to make arrangements now. The forecast is bleak for oil. Be responsible to your citizens and make arrangements. @saudinews50_en
6158 2018-12-15 18:46:25 So you don't believe in climate change and you don't believe the US and OPEC are flooding the market with oil? It should be me that's done here. You're clearly an idiot of the highest order.
6159 2018-12-15 18:46:25 Synthetic oil, fancy filter. I got a good deal compared to last time
6160 2018-12-15 18:46:22 This cbd oil made my ankle feel so much better 
6161 2018-12-15 18:46:20 You do realize that oil will still be necessary for a whole bunch of things. Almost everything you use is a byproduct and there is no alternative. And in 5-10 years? Keep dreaming.
6162 2018-12-15 18:46:11 Your art looks awesome, sort of an old west oil paint style!!
6163 2018-12-15 18:46:11 @hockeyhunka @BarryHcl2 I see a very familiar face (and shoulder?) in this video! 
6164 2018-12-15 18:46:10 Check your Engine oil today.
6165 2018-12-15 18:46:05 Simple.
Trudeau doesn’t have the balls to tell Quebec “you want money from out West in payments, you need to let the Energy East pipeline go through”...
That & lots of Lib cronies make too much money with their tankers bringing Saudi Oil to east coast...
6166 2018-12-15 18:46:03 So i put tea tree oil on this bump and its tingling... is this normal?
6167 2018-12-15 18:45:57 currently at Lucas Oil Stadium to donate blood and you can go onto the field or in the stands and watch Christmas movies on the jumbotron 
6168 2018-12-15 18:45:52 Gimme oil.abeg
6169 2018-12-15 18:45:45 In the Pacific, the US is not bound to defend Philippine oil and fisheries resources in its EEZ, but to defend the Philippine territory from attack.  In terms of a US response, trade plays a large role and withdrawing from the TPP was a mistake (same with the JCPOA).  4/
6170 2018-12-15 18:45:43 Denier of reality (man made global warming), shill for the oil and coal companies.
6171 2018-12-15 18:45:38 No such thing as living your day to day life without oil, don't ask a environmentalist or green energy lobbyist unless you don't care about the truth.
6172 2018-12-15 18:45:37 My oil cart was half full last night... and it’s damn near empty now lmao love that
6173 2018-12-15 18:45:34 Popcorn shouldn't be fattening unless you prepare it in oil, add butter and salt.  It's actually a good occasional treat for dogs if air popped.  My dog loves popcorn as well.
6174 2018-12-15 18:45:25 I want to soak in oil at this point, my skin feels dry and I can’t take it
6175 2018-12-15 18:45:24 since we have another week to prepare, Imma need my secret santa to get:
coconut oil
rings
earrings
film for my vintage camera
black belt
my licence
6176 2018-12-15 18:45:22 Cocoa butter and vitamin e oil!!
6177 2018-12-15 18:45:20 What's with that cooking oil spray? It goes everywhere. It's makes an unremovable coating on baking dishes. 

Buttering a baking dish with a stick of butter puts it only where it needs to be and if it adds a taste it's the wonderful taste of butter.
6178 2018-12-15 18:45:20 that is the right way to rule. @narendramodi should know by now.
6179 2018-12-15 18:45:18 The health claims for grapeseed oil are based on its supposedly high amounts of nutrients, antioxidants & polyunsaturated fats

6181 2018-12-15 18:44:50 Ultra conservative, Republican, daughter of an oil man. How inane to annihilate the wild horses when over 88% of the USA citizens love them! Especially when every horse will make $$$ for our veterans. Sovereign w/our resources yes! Go forwards not backwards! Curses or Blessings.
6182 2018-12-15 18:44:50 How is this more complicated? All oil and gas pipes into Ireland run through the UK
6183 2018-12-15 18:44:39 Oil Fundamental Forecast: Neutral
Risks to prices including slowing global growth, more hawkish Fed and weaknesses in stocks
Crude oil prices head into the remaining weeks of 2018 looking vulnerable.
6184 2018-12-15 18:44:27 And you’re not? KM wants to send 340 tankers a year through Juan da Fuca of bitumen, not oil. A race to the bottom sending an unrefined product overseas while we pay ridiculous prices for gas
6185 2018-12-15 18:44:27 In case you haven't connected the news dots... Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal.
6186 2018-12-15 18:44:24 Sana, lahat ng canned tuna kagaya ng Gold Seas tuna. Less oil, puno yung lata ng tuna at di durog durog and most importantly, walang extenders so pure tuna lang talaga.
6187 2018-12-15 18:44:24 Paid all my bills, worked, got an oil change, and cleaned. Wtf am i doing with my life.
6188 2018-12-15 18:44:23 there are FOUR mechanics at this shop changing the oil on ONE car and I just need my tire plugged so I can go home
6189 2018-12-15 18:44:21 So many crazy people on the internet. honestly. All these lies about Israel and Israelis. As if Israel is NOT the smallest country in the middle east, while Arabs have all the oil, money and power that they have. Good grief!
6190 2018-12-15 18:44:12 Last night Hussain Manik had ގަރުދިޔަ with bagee riyaaz and today oil massage with yameen. WTF
6191 2018-12-15 18:44:08 How many Saturdays does this thing go on for?
6192 2018-12-15 18:44:04 You're supposed to seize the oil and return it after fine of 32% of the oil value :
6193 2018-12-15 18:43:45 Get over it, people who love the snake oil salesman should come first.
6194 2018-12-15 18:43:44 Niggas hate me more than these bitches and it’s because I’m slicker than canola oil and can’t be caught. 
6195 2018-12-15 18:43:43 When the tax is applied to all industries and regions you may have a point, but when Quebec cement plants, NB coal plants, and Vancouver continues to be the largest exporter of coal in North America then to continue to target only oil and gas will lead to separation.
6196 2018-12-15 18:43:43 An admirable goal but the first priority is to stop *burning* oil, not stop using it.  And I cycle to work, heat my home with clean electricity and fly very seldom.

But personal choice only gets us so far. Good policy is necessary.

What are YOU doing?
6197 2018-12-15 18:43:37 Sm ppl r busy majoring on social media networks as a means 2 campaign. Mind u, sm are doing underground works, grassroot engagement nd social media jabs (3in1). By Febuhari now, dey will start shouting rigging. Why won't they, wen all dey kno is d wealth of oil rigs!

6198 2018-12-15 18:43:37 Maybe just maybe it'd be smart for Alaska to start pulling away from it's economic dependency on oil and attempt to diversify. ONE industry seems to control Alaska. That's not a good place to be IMHO.
6199 2018-12-15 18:43:23 Usually i'm not only able to handle very spicy food, i love it. But the homemade Sichuan chili oil i made puts a certain strain on my ability to sit. Still... Worth it.
6200 2018-12-15 18:43:21 Alberta needs to move on. In 5-10 years automakers will stop production of internal combustion engines. The oil market is just too competitive for Alberta's product. Time to diversify.

6203 2018-12-15 18:42:54 I wonder how much The Steamboat Institute paid Ryan Zinke to speak in Steamboat.
I wonder what he did with the money.
I wonder if the American taxpayers paid for his trip to come to Steamboat.
I wonder if he is owned by oil and gas.
I wonder if i should contact Mr. Mueller.
6204 2018-12-15 18:42:51 Not true, your yearly physical blood work tells them if your insulin response is ok. Keto diet already proven to die years earlier, most likely from cancer due to all the meat. Vegan diet is crap also. Proven best diet is Pescatarian, fish, oilive oil, fruits and vegatables.

6209 2018-12-15 18:42:02 Sure, but Feds responsible & have jurisdiction over many of the harmful decisions of late: killing Northern Gateway; Tanker Ban that applies only to AB oil; Bill C-69; uncertainty over TMX; etc.

6211 2018-12-15 18:41:56 Welcome @GretaThunberg to this fight. Oil should be kept underground. That is the only way for the planet. That is what we have been pushing for #Yasuni while our presidents steal (literally) our future @Presidencia_Ec @juanseroldan
6212 2018-12-15 18:41:51 You can’t ridicule drake for using writers & be a fan of Kanye at the same time.. that’s water and oil.. check out the writing credits on any Kanye song, he needs a team on every track
6213 2018-12-15 18:41:50 Try Hemp Oil! No thc in it ... just pain relief and sleep.
6214 2018-12-15 18:41:50 Running out of land to rape?  Got all the endangered species back on the kill list.  Pleased the gas and oil guys enough?
6215 2018-12-15 18:41:49 Just had a reading where her pops told her he was happy she finally changed her oil

6218 2018-12-15 18:41:40 Bored of this “end dog meat” “no more palm oil” shit coming from people that eat meat, cba. Like great that u care. Selectively. Cows are giant dogs, animal agriculture is a leading cause of rainforest destruction, faux concern for the rainforest and animals needs leaving in 2018
6219 2018-12-15 18:41:32 That was the longest oil change ever 
6220 2018-12-15 18:41:20 Coconut oil. I melt a tablespoon or two and massage it into dry hair. Let it sit. Then wash my hair.
6221 2018-12-15 18:41:16 Oil and bake them- done!
6222 2018-12-15 18:41:15 And one of the most corrupt of Trump's swamp monsters, right up there with Betsy DeVos. You think protecting oil interests in Alaska is worth sacrificing your natural beauty? You want to become Gary, Indiana??
6223 2018-12-15 18:41:01 Oil king ooooo man, I literally have him going 0-2 let’s see!
6224 2018-12-15 18:40:42 feelin a bit bad for promoting oil company tho :T
6225 2018-12-15 18:40:35 なんか大学のWi-Fiじゃないとダメっぽいです…。
6226 2018-12-15 18:40:34 If your oil doesn't explicitly state how it is processed, then you should assume that it was extracted using chemicals like hexane.
6227 2018-12-15 18:40:34 Yeah, you are certainly one of them. There's no other way to go about it than this. Deal with it!!!
6228 2018-12-15 18:40:33 Nah, we all do. I guess they just pass the film of sweat, oil, and dead skin cells that accumulates off as a "glow"?
6229 2018-12-15 18:40:31 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
6230 2018-12-15 18:40:31 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6231 2018-12-15 18:40:27 In reality, even factoring out climate change, we have a much shorter timeline for action on converting our infrastructure away from oil and coal, as these things will become rapidly more expensive once we can no longer defer the cost of extracting them from the ground.
6232 2018-12-15 18:40:24 *Jack screams out, oil seeping from his back. Meanwhile Max just stood up, her nose gushing with blood* Max: You mother fucker....you hurt Jack!
Jack: Ill be fine max.....just fight him...i can repair myself....*Max snarls and runs at the Lucario*
6233 2018-12-15 18:40:23 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
6234 2018-12-15 18:40:22 Wowww, here in America, the land of Idiocracy, we pay between $30 and $50 US dollars for an oil change.
6235 2018-12-15 18:40:20 Not at all, because we aren't mediocre. There are a lot of football teams. We're just not quite as good as teams backed by obscene amounts of oil money or by a larger overseas fanbase.
6236 2018-12-15 18:40:18 Unless you're a knife catcher I see no bullish signs. From a bearish prospective Oil and Tech set up best. $USO $SMH $XRT

This doesn't mean we can't rally next week it means I won't participate in it b/c it would be a low probability set up.

No FOMO
6237 2018-12-15 18:40:17 I want to count this PAPER kam na gu Novel @phynofino  #oil
6238 2018-12-15 18:40:11 Brent, thanks for the clarification of the NDP performance. For awhile there I thought notley and the NDP were anti oil. Oh wait a minute, they were, but now not, but will be again if by some miracle they win in the spring.  Don’t trust them one bit.
6239 2018-12-15 18:40:05 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
6240 2018-12-15 18:39:49 That simple reality means our expensive to produce, hard to refine and ship oil has no future. We need $100 oil. But 2 things stand in the way of that.  1 battle for marketshare described above and 2 reduced buying power due to flat wages mean people can't afford $100 oil
6241 2018-12-15 18:39:48 There was me thinking you’d be a fan of palm oil Yacster...
6242 2018-12-15 18:39:44 You're talking about the differential. That's the minor problem. The bigger bust problem is global oil prices. That's responsible for way more of the current downturn than the differential. Global oil prices are down 66% from 2008 highs and down 33% since September.
6243 2018-12-15 18:39:43 smart cats know that when the orange man tries to formulate a clear sentence, a tibetan monch has brainfreeze #impeach
6244 2018-12-15 18:39:39 How about standing by the 30,000 oil workers out of work in Alberta?Why only help the GM guys?
6245 2018-12-15 18:39:29 It's one of those days where grounding oneself before handling electricity means wiping the gob of olive oil from the underside pinky finger

6249 2018-12-15 18:39:18 Oil & Vinegar Failure.
6250 2018-12-15 18:39:15 It’s the main character from the movie: “There Will Be Blood.” He’s a ruthless oil prospector. Steal’s people’s land...
6251 2018-12-15 18:39:08 パソコン音痴なので分かりません…。
6252 2018-12-15 18:39:02 Oil king / fujimura winners finals LETS GO
6253 2018-12-15 18:38:54 Google. There are some essential oil mixes that apparently repel them. But they need reapplied a lot.
6254 2018-12-15 18:38:50 Halliburton = Dick Cheney 
And Oil. Halliburton makes the pipes and other oil industry necessary infrastructure. Also Zinke (and his department) SOLD significant amounts of Fed land for exploration for, yes, oil giants.
But ya know, only hires the best
6255 2018-12-15 18:38:49 The main difference being the amount of competition for the tittle in Wenger's 1st 100wins, now we have all the oil tycoons buying the tittles...you have to admit to completely different errers!
6256 2018-12-15 18:38:30 Lemme oil my scalp.
6257 2018-12-15 18:38:21 But we we are debating a tangent anyway. That idea that top exec's at oil companies are not in conversation with top exec's of car companies is the fallacy.  They are, and would tend to act in mutually beneficial ways.
6258 2018-12-15 18:38:17 For soup, cook diced leek in oil, then simmer with cheese, oregano, vegetable broth and spinach. Top with sour cream.
6259 2018-12-15 18:38:09 After seeing my oil was super low, I made a dash to get my oil changed and was going to head to Austin from there, but jokes on me! I FORGOT MY DRESS IN MY CLOSET 

Disaster avoided, yikes
6260 2018-12-15 18:38:03 Oil change takes like 30 minutes on your own, MAYBE an hour if it's your first time.  Unless your time is worth more than $100 per hour (200 once you know what you're doing) you're cucking yourself.
6261 2018-12-15 18:38:00 Climate change says the oil industry needs to die. 

Even assuming that is false the US and OPEC are both increasing production levels to maintain a global glut in oil. Whenever supply falls a bit and prices recover the US increases production again.
6262 2018-12-15 18:37:39 My whole career was spent in oil and gas engineering and technology development. You're simply wrong.
The energy industry has secured a wonderful lifestyle to Canadians, the envy of the world. Windmills and solar panels are a part of energy evolution but can't begin  to compete.
6263 2018-12-15 18:37:35 And? Is oil money breaking the law? No. Did you get a trophy for knocking them out of the CL? No instead you got slapped up by Madrid in the Final
6264 2018-12-15 18:37:18 New coffee recipe:
8 oz coffee
MCT Oil

Turmeric
Cinnamon 
Full Cream

Soooooooo good.
Crazy good.
6265 2018-12-15 18:37:14 Even better with oil and garlic put into them x
6266 2018-12-15 18:37:11 Bio oil
6267 2018-12-15 18:37:03 I can hear the collective groans all of all the people who waited in line in the hot sun for extra md bottles at the md release just to find out there wasn’t going to be many available. Glad I had a ticket and grabbed term oil taps instead.
6268 2018-12-15 18:36:54 “I know it sounds scary.”
She sighed and went over to see if there was any oil to collect.
"They always had weird cookie recipe.”
6269 2018-12-15 18:36:39 Whos shutting down the oil industry? There’s a glut too many players alberta gov. mismanagement for 40 years price is low typical rollercoaster so lets blame trudeau?
6270 2018-12-15 18:36:38 Loved your segment and love Pearl Olives.. Always serving seedless and marinated in Olive oil and sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese. A favorite for everyone.
6271 2018-12-15 18:36:38 VPN
6272 2018-12-15 18:36:38 Your comment is completely ignorant and stupid: the $35 differential between Canadian and US oil prices, proves its entirely a made in Canada problem.  Trudeau has killed 2 pipelines and has been completely incompetent on the 3rd.
6273 2018-12-15 18:36:32 Not meaning you, of course...
Just in general... I like balsamic.
I like oil & vinegar with a touch of honey. They don't have that as a singular name though.
6274 2018-12-15 18:36:30 My friend has an Audi and it costs that motherfucker ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for an oil change.

He refuses to let me teach him how to do it on his own for 30.
6275 2018-12-15 18:36:23 An invigorating facial mask, sultry red, with Sri Lankan cinnamon, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating amber dust. It's a brittle clay.
6276 2018-12-15 18:36:06 My dad took my car for an oil change and then kept the free car wash for himself RUDE
6277 2018-12-15 18:36:03 I just realized there is cbd flower. I've only seen it In oil form. I'm going to have to try the flower soon.
6278 2018-12-15 18:35:54 What did you get? Diamond infused oil?!?
6279 2018-12-15 18:35:50 Agreed he’s atrophy hunting oil swigging monster
6280 2018-12-15 18:35:47 Don’t ever listen to the opinion of someone out east regarding the Oil - they don’t pay attention or care. My work has a Toronto office and this week one guy said “You guys are having a shitty season”.  I think he last checked the Western Conf standings a year ago.
6281 2018-12-15 18:35:47 Ago carry oil cam smear top
6282 2018-12-15 18:35:41 Me too.
They deserve to print their own n use the oil revenues to develop the country
6283 2018-12-15 18:35:35 I can’t wait to spend all my IT money on beard oil, face mask and hungry girls 
6284 2018-12-15 18:35:25 This thing embarrassed this evening  but na sure person that oil be. O ja si
6285 2018-12-15 18:35:24 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + decorations + plans + map! Go!
6286 2018-12-15 18:35:21 And good beard oil around.?
6287 2018-12-15 18:35:15 With oil money, cheating and being backed by a whole country, I think we still doing well compared to them. We kicked them out of CL and we are 2 points off them, not 10 as you. You should watch out to reach 4th place
6288 2018-12-15 18:35:12 don't think the oil companies have to worry about the cost of a room, they own all of Alberta.
6289 2018-12-15 18:34:58 すやぽぽぽん
6290 2018-12-15 18:34:46 Ok I'll contact you January InshaAllah
6291 2018-12-15 18:34:37 Do you have oil ‍

You think it's by exporting olosho to Abuja 
6292 2018-12-15 18:34:34 ねるねるねるね〜
6293 2018-12-15 18:34:33 Themite and Hibana wanting more research supplies for sure, mute and vigil wanting noise canceling headphones, Blackbeard and Rook want they friends and colleagues to have a good holidays and are ready to help make it happen, GSG9 wanting more adidas and Glaz wants oil paints!
6294 2018-12-15 18:34:28 I think they live in the storm sewers, not the sanitary sewers.  So they probably smell of musty water, rubber, oil, chemicals & other runoff from the streets & lawns.
6295 2018-12-15 18:34:25 Oil prices are artificially low because they don't take into account long-term considerations like scarcity over time. And this artificial cheapness has created a plateau of progress, as we're less motivated to innovate and adopt newer technologies. We've removed the urgency.
6296 2018-12-15 18:34:24 Came for an oil change , homie telling me about the unnecessary which adds up to $240!! . Sir i want ONLy a oil change ! 
6297 2018-12-15 18:34:18 Motor oil
6298 2018-12-15 18:34:16 Only spent $130 at my oil change so clearly I have finally mastered adulting...
6299 2018-12-15 18:34:00 334
6300 2018-12-15 18:33:56 Private companies use stock funds, bank loans and other. A lot of powerful people who have well funded lobbyists.  Oil is the an industry that does not evolve and innovate as quickly as other because of highly expensive infrastructure that need to be made profitable.
6301 2018-12-15 18:33:54 that's good. Maybe we can get the oil and gas guys to not go to the board meetings that allows cheap, safe, efficient cars into Canada.
Enough of these guys controlling improvements to our inports
6302 2018-12-15 18:33:53 Im annoyed af that my car has expensive taste too oil changes be roughhhhhh
6303 2018-12-15 18:33:48 Lovely folk... something tells me they’re perfectly happy to benefit from southern oil money though. There’s never been more asinine arguments than ‘they voted, let them suffer’ or ‘my taxes should only go to people who agree with me’
6304 2018-12-15 18:33:34 There would be no "bust" if the Oil industry if it was allowed access to tidewater and international markets. At present we sell domestically or the USA at grossly underpriced value....Re: WTI vs WCS
6305 2018-12-15 18:33:30 Which black castor oil ? Any kind ? And do grow do work
6306 2018-12-15 18:33:20 God I wish our oil only costed $8.50 a barrel to make....oh, also wish we could get it to tide water 
6307 2018-12-15 18:33:16 i think it’s a little too strong so you need to have a light hand and know good blending techniques for it to not look unnatural, also it dries out pretty quick so always keep it covered and if it dries out add a drop or two of some sort of facial oil :)
6308 2018-12-15 18:33:16 It’s going to be a coal or oil lobbyist
6309 2018-12-15 18:33:13 Χριστουγεννιατικη εορτή για τα παιδιά των εργαζομένων της motor oil λέει. Εντωμεταξύ είναι απ τα πιο ευνοημένα παιδιά καθώς μέσα στην εταιρεία επικρατεί οικογενειοκρατία και μόνο αυτά θα μπορούν να προσληφθούν αργότερα έστω και για πρακτική.
6310 2018-12-15 18:33:03 My daughter and I both use the Body Shop tea tree range , the oil is amazing to dab on spots , and I love the body wash , we have the whole range . I would share this treat with my daughter we could have so much beauty time together 
#fillyourstockings #enchantedbynature
6311 2018-12-15 18:33:00 "Woefully unprepared" implies there's some other economic sector Alberta was particularly good at that simply needed to be developed and it could replace the oil sands.  Well it was wheat before and while Alberta was pretty good at it but llots of other places are too.
6312 2018-12-15 18:32:56 Ok first of all u can’t put any kinda thc oil in a fuckin breeze
6313 2018-12-15 18:32:46 Once oil and gas phased out the US military will be out of a job
6314 2018-12-15 18:32:43 I’m sure you’re a billionaire by now with the depth and breadth of your market perception. And you believe all that bullshit the MSM spews about oil dying? Sure you do.
6315 2018-12-15 18:32:39 Jesus...you read an article like that and even the non-believers have to come to the realization that these guys will write whatever the flavour of the moment is and want any excuse to get back on the good side if the organization. So much for accountability.
6316 2018-12-15 18:32:37 2 Chronicles 31:

5 As soon as the command was spread abroad,
 the people of Israel gave in abundance the 
firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all 
the produce of the field. And they brought
 in abundantly the tithe of everything

6318 2018-12-15 18:32:18 I am going to start taking CBD oil again and then I will be God damn invincible
6319 2018-12-15 18:32:13 It is even more annoying when you consider that this imbecile of a governor was calling God's precious name while openly exhibiting his bigotry. Pls remind him that Oyo can't survive as a state without the crude oil from Secondus' backyard.
6320 2018-12-15 18:32:10 Wym mayo with olive oil  in confusion

6322 2018-12-15 18:32:08 I'm measuring my ketones 24/7. Just by how my brain feels. Eat 2 slices of pizza, wait an hour, what you brain feels like at that moment means low ketone levels. Eat 2 table spoons of coconut oil after a fast and wait an hour. That's what high ketones feels like. Repeat to learn.
6323 2018-12-15 18:32:05 In March 2003, Kellogg Brown & Root, Halliburton's construction and engineering subsidiary, received from the Pentagon what is called a sole-source contract, meaning it was awarded without bidding, to restore and operate Iraqi oil wells. The contract, which was classified
6324 2018-12-15 18:32:02 OLBAS oil on your pillow 
Never fails
6325 2018-12-15 18:31:56 Gas is down because of the world oil market. Lower taxes mean higher deficit because the government brings in less revenue. Isn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?
6326 2018-12-15 18:31:54 Another cracker Paul. Here's alternative closing lines:

6338 2018-12-15 18:30:40 I have not taken anything. The person who prepared this has mentioned the subsidy. So you can provide actual data if you have with 3 major parameters which I had asked. 1) subsidy, 2) loss by oil company 3) unpaid oil debt and also include state and central tax separately
6339 2018-12-15 18:30:37 Holey Moley!  You didn’t tell us that bio oil is $30 for a bottle!!  The one I found in rite aid was processed on 2015. I’ll keep looking!

6345 2018-12-15 18:30:08 Lower oil prices too. Although could be some recent price-support emerging at around $60/bbl for Brent. Interestingly this is still above the long-term inflation-adjusted median price in the low $50s. But expectations & dependencies have expanded during the years of $100+ oil.
6346 2018-12-15 18:30:07 Girls be darker than Akon talkin bout they mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?

6351 2018-12-15 18:29:36 In a world where the US and OPEC are both fighting to maintain marketshare prices will never rise. 

Which means our oil business isn't a good one to be in.
6352 2018-12-15 18:29:33 I fell down a deeeeeeeeeep youtube rabbit hole on Chris Watts last night. My guy murdered his wife and 2 daughters, shoved them down oil pipes and then pretended like he was concerned. Where the fuck do they make them at

6356 2018-12-15 18:28:41 "Why is that the standard Trudeau uses saying no to an oil pipeline through for Quebec (“there is no support“) isn’t the same standard he uses for a pipeline going through BC?"

Because Trudeau is a shallow, two faced narcissist.
6357 2018-12-15 18:28:38 Need to highlight 
In 2014 MMS left with Subsidy burden + Oil bonds + Pending payments for Iran 
In 2018 zero subsidy, Oil bonds being cleared and Iran debt being paid off

6359 2018-12-15 18:28:30 Royalties have been falling. The time you're talking about Natural gas was 5-10x more expensive, and oil was worth much more. Today only about a billion bucks comes in because oil and natural gas prices are in the toilet. And the US keeps increasing supply...
6360 2018-12-15 18:28:12 Never put cast iron in the dishwasher. Don’t put soap in it. Big mess?  Clean it with Kosher salt, hot water. Rub with oil
6361 2018-12-15 18:28:08 We're like oil and water, never meant to be together
Just strangers to each other
We're like rock and scissors, where one beats the other
Oh, no matter what
We are strangers to each other 
6362 2018-12-15 18:28:00 Neither have the oil.  But my first response was to the player contract situation. End of the day I care about the team.  97> 34 but the Leafs are better then the oil. That’s what’s important to me.  Hope I explained myself.
6363 2018-12-15 18:27:50 You should have gotten him some CBD oil, works wonders for my two girls
6364 2018-12-15 18:27:45 I used coconut oil as a makeup remover last night and biiiitchhhh.... LIFE. CHANGING.
6365 2018-12-15 18:27:42 $300 a barrel oil would make me less depressed
6366 2018-12-15 18:27:38 U.S. Natural Gas Drilling Steady as BHGE’s Oil Count Falls
6367 2018-12-15 18:27:35 Finally took my car to get an oil change
6368 2018-12-15 18:27:31 I know that many, many Albertans are enraged by the Trudeau name. I've witnessed it. It irritates the heck out of me because so much of the hate is misdirected. It's a knee-jerk thing when, for instance, world oil prices fall. *Everything* is Trudeau's/Notley's fault.
6369 2018-12-15 18:27:15 You get deep water, rocks, branches and other debris. Seen a car come a cropper earlier, raced into the water, hit a rock, engine dead and oil spill, poss cracked sump

6371 2018-12-15 18:27:06 Oil industry put toxic oil / tar / petroleum n skin creams cosmetics etc despite decades of warnings Linked to skin cancers (others too) due to contact with skin as well as when it interacts with sunlight - regardless how far it enters body  it does
What u use s ur choice Be well
6372 2018-12-15 18:26:52 The oil was mostly nationalized. New capital that gets created is driven by investment. So those were two separate examples.
6373 2018-12-15 18:26:51 A pipeline is considered in the national interest and is therefore under the constitutional domain of the federal government. Justin's dad forced the NEP on Alberta which limited what Alberta could get domestically for its oil. Money from these projects benefit the whole country
6374 2018-12-15 18:26:49 Sure now, its obvious that we can even do better
6375 2018-12-15 18:26:49 So would 4 other nations lol. You really are dreamers. So 4 nations that built the oil will all have shares ?  Indy 1 it was a 140$ a barrel. Now touching 60$ ?  Dream on geezer
6376 2018-12-15 18:26:37 You’re not glowing this girl ahh, be rubbing anointing oil and be deceiving yourself
6377 2018-12-15 18:26:37 Make watching basketball tolerable by pouring oil on the court and replacing basketballs with bowling balls (this also works with any other indoor sport)
6378 2018-12-15 18:26:35 Y’all, King David was always ready to receive the tea from the Lord.

“You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.” - Psalm 23:5
6379 2018-12-15 18:26:28 did a hot oil treatment. shampooed. now, deep conditioning treatment. im breaching over into hour 3.
6380 2018-12-15 18:26:26 I got a $75 visa gift card from my work. The adult in me says “get an oil change.” But the child in me says “3DS games.”
6381 2018-12-15 18:26:22 Go for Brexit and we will vote for independance then you will have to deal with an EU border in the North of England and negotiate for supplie of oil, gas and electricity to continue.  We see how weak England is, you cannot resit independance however you can stop Brexit.
6382 2018-12-15 18:26:18 I think Sam's heart is going to be broken forever & he is the son of the richest oil family in Texas so that creates problems for me.
6383 2018-12-15 18:26:17 Ctfuu she Better not need an oil change!
6384 2018-12-15 18:26:12 My stripper name would be too long to fit on a business card! (Do strippers have cards?) You see, my salad dressing is extra virgin olive oil, paradiso fig balsamic vinegar, turmeric, and freshly ground pepper. And, I'm disappointed in my mother for serving French dressing

6387 2018-12-15 18:26:01 Ok should we stop supplying oil and gas as 80 % comes through NI
6388 2018-12-15 18:25:59 Please screenwriters:

"Alexa, order me a gross of baby oil, confirm order"
6389 2018-12-15 18:25:45 Extra virgine olive oil for me
6390 2018-12-15 18:25:27 I was against going in in the first place. All the years we applied, then we strike gas and oil, we then got in quick smart. Wonder why
6391 2018-12-15 18:25:25 What happed to oil man?
6392 2018-12-15 18:25:21 BREAKFAST Dried Peaches Fried Apples with meat is required for cream 1 tablespoon of water 1 cup of cocoa oil, which has

6394 2018-12-15 18:25:11 Zinke is a slimeball who is a disgrace to the outdoor lovers and industry.  I'm sure he was smoozed by the oil industry.  Good that he is being investigated as he is part of the MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  Lock Him UP!

6396 2018-12-15 18:25:05 and the oil isn’t being driven by nationalization but rather by investment? don’t know the other metric but can research that on my own!
6397 2018-12-15 18:25:02 I’m on your side, but I’ve never had a seized engine due to lack of oil.
We shall see, but im certainly not falling out with anyone over it. Life waaaaaay too short.
6398 2018-12-15 18:24:58 @rshevlin - one can schedule a pick up of a sandwich, pizza, an oil change, claim inspection, Dr visit, and library book pick up on line. And a haircut.  Bankers' time has always been controlled by the bankers; why change now?
Not that there's any threats to traditional banking..
6399 2018-12-15 18:24:54 Wrapping the meat in leaves, he stows it in a jar full of seasoned oil then seals it shut with a bit of wax. Tucking it in a small hole in the dirt floor, he covers it then stands. “Fine. Tell me how?” He points at the coffee pot. “Every person there is waiting...”
6400 2018-12-15 18:24:50 I watch your show all the time here in US on PBS. Atlanta 8.1 & 8.2 I think.   I watched your waffles w/ olive oil show twice. Your voice is so soothing! 
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
6401 2018-12-15 18:24:46 Cool. I think wholefoods has organic avocado oil. I remember seeing it. Should give it a try after my vacation. Thank you. :)
6402 2018-12-15 18:24:43 "I wish.......This storm  lamp never extinguished!"
The Darkness Can Never Extinguish The Lamp, But the lamp burns bright when wick and oil are clean. Our  ethical and social responsibilities are to keep it clean. Let's all work together to strengthen the Child Rights Protection
6403 2018-12-15 18:24:40 Yeah it’s good gear, really nice to apply and dries quick. Usually go with oil base on exteriors but the MSP worked well
6404 2018-12-15 18:24:37 Very different. Hollandaise is based on a vinegar reduction with egg yolk and melted butter. Like a warm mayonaise where butter replaced oil. Carbonara is bacon, eggs and cheese.
6405 2018-12-15 18:24:24 Don’t forget USA exports oil again
6406 2018-12-15 18:24:21 Just took my car in to the mechanics and found out that the, over $100 oil change job I did at @jiffylube was never actually done. My oil was so black they said I could have blown my engine. And I hear that this is a thing with them!  #somad #wastedmoney #NeverAgain
6407 2018-12-15 18:24:16 And once I was @ one of my English friends’ place in England and while cooking I asked if she had any olive oil cause we basically put it in every mother fucking dish and she replied “ew”
6408 2018-12-15 18:24:10 Castro slicker than oil with those skills wow... #KCOneAfrica #CAFCC
6409 2018-12-15 18:23:50 Ah yes, John: how true (regarding the fact that we are in Europe). Thanks for your kind comments regarding Wally's painting: I was looking at it yesterday & one can clearly see a film of oil on the surface of the water which is so typical (sadly) of a working port like Boulogne.
6410 2018-12-15 18:23:44 ayun, sana oil
6411 2018-12-15 18:23:41 make sure you put oil on your edges and just wait for them to come out on their own
6412 2018-12-15 18:23:35 It has been cultivated throughout recorded history, used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and spiritual moods and medicine
6413 2018-12-15 18:23:34 But Me n u no go old bae
6414 2018-12-15 18:23:31 Well, if you just want to look at resources, a good example is the fact that most oil in the world is now owned by state oil companies. If you want to look at capital, you can look at FDI compared to domestic investment in countries like India, Indonesia, etc.
6415 2018-12-15 18:23:26 Help me tell her ooo... Screaming like witchcraft doll
6416 2018-12-15 18:23:22 Hey,  if vegetable oil is made of veggies,  and olive oil is made of olives,  what is baby oil made of?
6417 2018-12-15 18:23:18 My dad has been gone 20 years & I *still* hear him telling me to check my oil. 
6418 2018-12-15 18:23:15 -A barrel of toxic waste

-A fracking pump instruction book
-17 Laughing Oil Execs

6419 2018-12-15 18:23:15 So many say that @BJP4India has lost this election because they were in some way, unlucky- that #NOTA, that #Rafael . Really? crude oil price crashed 20-30% just in time for them, Mallya decision came ahead of Raj elections. Still, the result is this.
6420 2018-12-15 18:23:14 Cocoa butter oil first , Shea butter after
6421 2018-12-15 18:23:12 i need to go get an oil change smh. hate this shittttttt
6422 2018-12-15 18:23:02 Yeh my art is really large oil paintings... hopfully I'll be able to get a studio soon to do so. I'm sorry about that. Your potential is still there! I really hope in the future they take your work into serious consideration
6423 2018-12-15 18:22:58 Good old fashioned natural products like extra virgin olive oil work wonders for babies as a moisturizer, bum cream, for cradle cap etc....
6424 2018-12-15 18:22:58 We are always happy Kumbhakarnas still the hot oil comes pouring on us! 
Same attitude for Ram Mandir!
6425 2018-12-15 18:22:53 Gold, Diamonds, Coal, Platinum, Maybe Oil, Chrome, Iron Ore, Tobacco, Gorgeous tourist attractions and educated citizens!  Yet Zimbabwe is one of the most embarrassing countries.  38 + 5 is emotional torture for me!
6426 2018-12-15 18:22:49 Canadian oil is the only oil activists ever attack - and it's the most ethical, responsible & regulated. Go figure. 
6427 2018-12-15 18:22:42 The motor oil brand?
6428 2018-12-15 18:22:32 Shea butter and almond or olive oil. Unscented detergent.
6429 2018-12-15 18:22:29 Additionally, Quebec’s hydro is outside the transfer program but Alberta oil isn’t.  Are you claiming your hydro isn’t a resource?
6430 2018-12-15 18:22:28 Finally started using my oil diffuser and I’m in love. My place smells like pine and lemon grass right now 
6431 2018-12-15 18:22:27 I hope they don’t take hours to do this oil change. 
6432 2018-12-15 18:22:21 I am thinking buy silver calls once oil hits $45
6433 2018-12-15 18:22:18 Simple question, how do people up north keep warm without some heat source.  Can't burn coal, wood, manure, peat, etc etc.  You people need to get real.  Oil up those bicycle chains.
6434 2018-12-15 18:22:18 Time to oil that revolving door !!!
6435 2018-12-15 18:22:09 The United States does in fact need our oil. They consume more than they produce. Many of their large refineries are not set up for Permian crude. They are set up for heavier grades. Venezuela and Mexico are both declining. Those are facts.
6436 2018-12-15 18:22:07 Bank of Pinochet needs set up. Can invest savings in things guaranteed to turn a buck with no morals whatsoever. Child trafficking, torture and execution equipment, oil, tobacco, heroin and the global arms industry. End goal Western supremacy and free speech.
6437 2018-12-15 18:22:05 was looking at google earth and it's amazing all the gas and oil wells all over the place.

6439 2018-12-15 18:21:51 and you forgot the military, weapons of mass delusion, why the uk went to Iraq and killed people, all because of a central bank, and oil, plans to world domination, for sure
6440 2018-12-15 18:21:45 As an Italian I can easily say Italians aren’t able to live without olive oil
6441 2018-12-15 18:21:43 Trouble they sleep you go wake am, sorry to say you chose the wrong way to go about a campaign, it should be more of an educative and interactive session than that stunt you pulled.
This is Lagos, plus you're in a market place.
6442 2018-12-15 18:21:42 Why is she always shiny like she smeared oil on her face?
6443 2018-12-15 18:21:42 Fuck off. The smart money is in the oil industry not cleaning up its mess. I don't know anyone stupid enough to bet that the oil industry will clean up their messes. The costs are low estimates and likely to explode when we go to actually do the clean up work.
6444 2018-12-15 18:21:40 Nope. Good news though oil arrived today so we have heat again haha
6445 2018-12-15 18:21:32 The US has 1/4 of the world’s coal reserves and about 2% of the world’s  oil reserves. #helpfulhints #APHG
6446 2018-12-15 18:21:30 It’s incredible, I have three Moroccan oil brands but the garnier one is by far my favorite
6447 2018-12-15 18:21:23 Thanks for listening dude!  On a Saturday afternoon no less.  It's a big reason why I play Warframe in addition to the movement and lore.  Also THANK YOU for removing fish oil from archwings!  That was like Star Wars midochlorian levels.  Thank you so much!
6448 2018-12-15 18:20:55 20181214 Brent oil

6449 2018-12-15 18:20:48 I’ll change a tire any day of the week but I’m not changing oil ever again. Done it once and been paying people to do it ever since
6450 2018-12-15 18:20:37 You got a smoke screen, oil slick, and mini guns on that baby?
6451 2018-12-15 18:20:33 Andrew, Fair enough. In my personal experience, Brett’s leadership is helping me feel included in my Province and helping me feel that I am not wrong for helping produce our Gay friendly oil and gas. Foreign funded protestors have been telling me I am wrong, Brett defends me.
6452 2018-12-15 18:20:33 You got it in one,It’s Scotland’s oil.
6453 2018-12-15 18:20:32 Obviously predictions are different from knowing in advance. But if a mechanic predicts that your engine will seize unless you change the oil, what do you do? Tell him he doesn't have proof? Smh
6454 2018-12-15 18:20:29 Finally getting the oil change i was supposed to get like 2 months ago
6455 2018-12-15 18:20:24 He stockpiled our farm system with actual players not like the previous regime of only Oil King’s and veterans that would never play in NHL
6456 2018-12-15 18:20:17 the guys at my dealership forgot to do my tire rotation so they gave me a free one for the next time I get my oil changed and I’m pumped about it #adultjoys
6457 2018-12-15 18:19:44 Real life komi and a gamer? Noble hit the oil pocket.
6458 2018-12-15 18:19:42 Snakes, monkies etc don't trade. Markets are a Human construct.

No am not asking you to do the "being human" jig here.

But those doing monkeying, being snakes or even selling snake oil... Snatch your lunch from them, daily? That's what trading is.
6459 2018-12-15 18:19:39 sunscreen yg bagus sih dari jama kelas 1 sma sampe sekarang mahasiswi tingkat akhir cuman skinaqua. untuk cleansing oil saran aku yg murah dan kandungan oilnya ga terlalu banyak tapi ampun bisa make maybelline. untuk concealer bisa fit me atau maybelline yg gampang buat di blend

6461 2018-12-15 18:19:27 I hope Trump replaces Zinke with an oil industry executive—just to own the libs.
6462 2018-12-15 18:19:20 I need a butler. Is there a butler school? I'm going to see if I can hire a butler intern. Treating leather with mink oil has to be an elective course I bet. #PinkyOut
6463 2018-12-15 18:19:12 Big Data is The New OiL
6464 2018-12-15 18:19:09 If you don't diversify now, you'll again be in trouble. It is not traiterous to look at reality and prepare for it instead of one day waking up and stating that all oil production must end now. There is already a glut of oil.
6465 2018-12-15 18:19:00 You guys need to quit picking on Olive Oil. You keep it up and she is going to stop talking, and that would be a shame because she is great comic relief. And she is harmless. But having said that, if I was from the district that elected her, I would be really embarrassed.

6469 2018-12-15 18:18:48 I wonder how much The Steamboat Institute paid Ryan Zinke to speak in Steamboat.
I wonder what he did with the money.
I wonder if the American taxpayers paid for his trip to come to Steamboat.
I wonder if he is owned by oil and gas.
I wonder if i should contact Mr. Mueller.

6471 2018-12-15 18:18:21 It's going to be so easy making money off of oil equities in 2019. Have to be patient though and not jump in too early. ECA, CJ, PE, OAS, CRZO etc. all easy doubles once we hit bottom. Want to see WTI in the $40s first though.

6473 2018-12-15 18:18:13 Yes, they dont want the oil sands to fail, they want the oil sands to produce, and produce like a son a bitch. Then they buy the cheaper oilsands oil because they're the only ones we can sell too. Buy low sell high make bank.

6476 2018-12-15 18:18:01 The only thing @WBrettWilson cares about is his oil investments. He has a large conflict of interest in making an argument for separation. Change your diapers and go back to work. The sky ain’t falling.
6477 2018-12-15 18:17:58 Ive done it a few times but I always end up making them leaky . I have put dab oil in some empty pods a few times and that has worked like a charm
6478 2018-12-15 18:17:58 Interesting article. I see your point about the purge of all the oil execs
6479 2018-12-15 18:17:46 Sounds just as weird as the other advice I’ve seen about putting essential oils on the bottom of one’s feet to prevent colds. It doesn’t even have to be any oil in particular.
6480 2018-12-15 18:17:39 So, you’re okay with massive corruption, as long as your oil company buddies get access to public lands. Got it.
6481 2018-12-15 18:17:36 Rashid get correct information that your  Congress govt increased huge debt on Nation and paid subsidies. 
Modi govt paid that debt which created by Congress and stop subsidies so now government have no load about oil subsidies
You should thanks to Modi government if you patriots
6482 2018-12-15 18:17:31 A rich airline cant pay for a new bag?

Just stand up, and pay, and say you are sorry it taking you so long to admit we failed
And do it better next time

Okay?

6486 2018-12-15 18:16:57 Who cares. Doesn’t change which team is better today.  Considering the oil have had as many 1st overall picks as they have it’s kinda a joke they only have one playoff win nothing to be proud of.
6487 2018-12-15 18:16:52 Andrew Sheer wants to be a Harper 2.0. he's another #climatechange denier who panders to the oil and gas industry that is responsible for the existential #ClimateCrisis  Both Harper and Sheer belong in the same trash bin as Trump

6489 2018-12-15 18:16:23 To be mentioned for context - the images were under the rule of the Shah who decided to nationalise the oil industry shortly after. Obviously the US did not like this, so they supported the Islamic revoutionaries being afraid from a socialist revolution. Result you can see today.
6490 2018-12-15 18:16:21 Gotta Get My oil changed and my breaks done
6491 2018-12-15 18:16:12 When the Canadian federal government holds the foreign oil and tankers to the same standards as Canadian oil I will believe the country is committed to the environment.   As opposed to just shutting down Canadian oil resources so they can be Ecco celebrities

6496 2018-12-15 18:15:37 A country that  destroys over 300 illegal refinaries in the creeks anually is paying 1trillion to import the  same product of those refinaries. I am just pointing you to the  right direction. Deregulate and subsidize crude oil
6497 2018-12-15 18:15:31 Aren't American oil companies major investors in the oil sands of Alberta?

Car needs an oil change. I'll take of you baby (said to car).

Thanks @Take5_OilChange

Great service like always.
6503 2018-12-15 18:15:19 Grapeseed oil is processed from the seeds of grapes, which are a byproduct of winemaking.
6504 2018-12-15 18:15:19 lf they promised to pay them using the oil from a rock then it's alright.
6505 2018-12-15 18:15:19 Holy shit man, are you just figuring this out? Who ever said the oil biz is benevolent? It’s a dog-eat-dog world, son, and you better start eating, or else. The pro’s of having industry in your province outweigh the cons. But you’re a commie so the govt will magically pay for all
6506 2018-12-15 18:15:18 u have taken all high price when crude oil prices were high during regime . n though the price of cryde oil decresed from 112$ a. barrel to @  70 $  the retail petrol prices by current govt kept rising. not to metion they kept levying higher taxes to increase our misery
6507 2018-12-15 18:15:13 LRT: So Chiarelli is now a genius because of:

- Chiasson’s shooting % bender
- Koskinen’s 15 game sample
- The Coach.

Imagine if you shot yourself in the foot and then struck oil in the ground beneath. That’s 2018-19 Peter Chiarelli.
6508 2018-12-15 18:15:05 In page 388; NCP under Atiku decided to sell SADIQ OIL one of our oil marketing companies. Now u will understand why he is looking forward to sell NNPC .

6516 2018-12-15 18:14:39 Gampangnya lagi, mukanya diuapin dulu pake air hangat, atau habis mandi (soalnya kulit mati pasti melunak), kalo ada minyak zaitun, olive oil atau baby oil di rumah, gosokin ke idung. Pijatnya agak lamaan, ntar bakal rontok sendiri.
6517 2018-12-15 18:14:33 Alternative energy? are we stupid, the hell with that, Canada has oil. This is European bs cause they have no oil and gas.
6518 2018-12-15 18:14:28 Imagine being so shortsighted that you think lobbying for oil is more profitable than investing in renewable energy
6519 2018-12-15 18:14:15 My vests always getting stained with oil from the wire 
6520 2018-12-15 18:14:15 $370 to get my car starter replaced and oil change, could be worse 
6521 2018-12-15 18:14:06 But the VP even confirmed it yesterday, have you forgotten? Have you also forgotten that it was "on the news" that the oil marketers were asking for their (subsidy) money. Did you not read it in the newspapers?

6524 2018-12-15 18:13:08 Are there Canadian governments buying oil from those countries?  No not one. So what misdirection is this cartoon trying to do. Another Postmedia rant against something that isn't happening. Conservatives should know better.
6525 2018-12-15 18:13:01 The supreme leader of Iran is worth $200 billion. During Ahamdinejad's administration, Iran's oil revenue was $800 billion, more than all the oil revenues combined during the entire both Pahlavi monarchs. $200 billion of it disappeared and the leftist/commies/toudehi don't care.
6526 2018-12-15 18:12:58 Think I can get some free tires and oil changes out of it?
6527 2018-12-15 18:12:54 Brother Oil for the win last night.
6528 2018-12-15 18:12:53 I thought I was the only one scared about this kayan.... which one is bonding oil, get money soap, favour soap etc
6529 2018-12-15 18:12:49 Be sure to follow the money from Big Oil & Gas as it flows back to Trump, Kushner Enterprises. A bunch of Crooks is all they are!
6530 2018-12-15 18:12:45 I try not to make it a habit to start sentences with “you should”...And residential developments are much more controlled locally than oil and gas. There’s still much more to do in that arena but there’s a massive difference in what municipalities can do in housing vs. O&G.
6531 2018-12-15 18:12:29 I read your tweet to my husband.  He chuckled and said, “That reminds me... I need to get my oil changed...”  
6532 2018-12-15 18:12:19 Agreed. Neither will Hillary. Beto might, but he lost his senate try. Gives fodder to his opponents. Plus the Big Oil donations thing and lack of progressive credentials is troubling. My darkhorse? Amy Klobuchar. She is the least offensive to DLCers and progressives alike.
6533 2018-12-15 18:12:11 Grapeseed oil is often promoted as healthy due to its high amounts of polyunsaturated fat and vitamin E.
6534 2018-12-15 18:12:10 Grape seed oil is relatively high in vitamin E and phenolic antioxidants, as well as a rich source of omega-6 fatty acids.
6535 2018-12-15 18:12:10 Even Univ of Texas has its own oil well. Big on sports. Fantastic water ski access in Colorado river dams. A bit humid otherwise. :-)
6536 2018-12-15 18:12:01 They’d be less bigoted if they realized how much of their lifestyle is paid for by our oil and gas industry.  And how much their opposition is costing.

One group was upset that a spill might cost their industry millions.  And not having the pipe is costing $80 million a day.
6537 2018-12-15 18:11:48 Which service? A fraudulent energy contract to restore the power in PR from a company created out of thin air? The deregulation of federally protected land for exploratory drilling in search for oil? His constant use of taxpayer money for travel and personal expenses?
6538 2018-12-15 18:11:43 Everyone, I put flaxseed in my pumpkin bread and reduced the sugar and oil so it's definitely appropriate to constitute 100% of my diet for the next week
6539 2018-12-15 18:11:40 Do they make a essential oil for butthurt people? I think I can make my millions selling that.

So I’m currently an esthetics student (hence the MIA) and experimenting with essential oil blends and how aromatherapy affects the mind + body.
Who’d be interested soon in a aromatherapy body oil line?
6541 2018-12-15 18:11:29 Canada could use it's oil for decades more, lowering the prices of gas for Canadians . Instead of shipping the oil to other countries, build a domestic program to lower the price for domestic use. Canada has enough demand to do it, but the infrastructure is lacking.
6542 2018-12-15 18:11:27 Comments are always appreciated.  

Not everyone on #OOTT is an expert on oil and gas details so I try to provide context &  perpective.

6546 2018-12-15 18:10:36 In the case of o&g the motivation is profit. They are automating jobs away as fast as possible everywhere. In 10 years they will have a tiny fraction of the workforce they have today, and you'll be out of work. What then? Why are you so insistent that we back big oil?
6547 2018-12-15 18:10:36 Yeah but then consultants will come in and be like "you could make so much money for a new library named after an oil sheikh" and the cycle begins again.

6549 2018-12-15 18:10:14 You obviously don't understand the meaning of diversity. It's not to kill one entity and rely strickly on the other. Supporting oil actually keeps Canada diverse. Maybe for Christmas someone will get you a dictionary so you don't look as stupid in the future
6550 2018-12-15 18:10:09 Definitely up imo.  KSA will game the EIA weekly #s again. I believe DJT greenlighted KSA cuts about a month ago w/ his MSB comments. Takes 5-8 weeks to ship oil KSA->US. US prod capoed till mid '19 when new pipes r done imo.

6553 2018-12-15 18:09:28 "the bottom line is that we aren’t net exporters of crude oil, and we aren’t energy independent. But, the U.S. has trended in that direction for over a decade... this is undoubtedly a remark-able achievement."

6557 2018-12-15 18:08:50 What if we disagree? The #boycottwhistler  campaign shows that the oil and gas industry is really, really, really  desperate not to talk about its responsibility for the costs of #climatechange. They want taxpayers to pay 100% of those costs.

Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a lawyer and longtime lobbyist for the oil and gas industry, is expected to take Zinke's place.
He's expected to pursue a similar agenda of deregulation on the nation's public lands.
6575 2018-12-15 18:06:33 Hollywood ‘s latest thing. When you can’t find “the real stuff” use crude oil.
6576 2018-12-15 18:06:29 BC and Quebec are both importing foreign oil and refined products into their refineries and petrol stations. This is not about saving the environment! Follow the money, there are politicians getting paid to block Albertans oil from reaching other markets.
6577 2018-12-15 18:06:28 What’s the oil???? 3 weeks like guaranteed???
6578 2018-12-15 18:06:27 "management and conservation" of our land.
Sounds like a job for an oil barron from 1800 or so.
6579 2018-12-15 18:06:12 I think the first thing that should be done is prevent any of these activist from  owning or purchasing anything that is made   by oil products or consumes gas , starting with mr. Suzuki and mr. Gore," the green gangsters"

6583 2018-12-15 18:05:45 Comment to make. Why do you hate spurs? Year we lost out to Chelsea opposite fans were delighted when those racist oil monger scum won the league ahead of us, why? A club where we bring through young talent instead of spending 80+ million on foreign crap. Lot worse clubs than us.
6584 2018-12-15 18:05:32 That was not sarcasm. :) You were not justifying.
One more time: if you are dissatisfied with taxation policy or world's oil reserves and, because of that, start burning random cars and waving Jolly Rogers on the streets, you're a fool, or blindly following orders.

6589 2018-12-15 18:05:21 Andrew Scheer believes oil is the fuel for 21st Century and wants to go all-in and not begin to diversifying.

I've done all of the above.  But hey, the difference is, I've never lied to the FBI about it.

The other issue I have with you is "Big Israeli Oil".  Is that actually a thing?
6593 2018-12-15 18:04:41 The government lost me with their actions on oil and pipelines. You can't have a growing oil industry and fight climate change. You can have a shrinking oil industry and fight climate change.
6594 2018-12-15 18:04:39 Nice job Stinky! Reduce all the public land for Oil and Uranium .... THEN LEAVE!!! You're a thief and the only payback to the taxpayers is $200+ and you still get to keep your retirement home that was built by taxpayers money!!!

6597 2018-12-15 18:04:30 Palm oil is also responsible for mass deforestation and should never be used or produced.

6603 2018-12-15 18:03:46 Zinke’s combination of crackpot swagger and contempt for public lands will be hard to top. But I’m confident the tiny-handed oil company marionette has someone even worse on deck.
6604 2018-12-15 18:03:40 Also Quebec is huge importer if AB oil. But facts shouldn’t get in the way of a great persecution complex
6605 2018-12-15 18:03:33 You're caught up in tax loss selling. This rut is temporary. My E&Ps are both priced at 2016 levels when oil was $26, not $52. Be ready to buy on Jan 1st or sooner if the Fed blesses the markets with good news Wed. Trade war relief would sent E&Ps up.
6606 2018-12-15 18:03:27 Good riddance to Ryan Zinke, who absurdly claimed environmentalists were to blames for forest fires, threatened Washington's coast with offshore oil drilling, and was asleep at the switch while the greatest threat to our planet and our people, climate change, continued unabated.

6612 2018-12-15 18:03:17 Just Fox. Hardly a journalist among them. Snake oil salesmen, mostly.
6613 2018-12-15 18:03:15 Or it might never happen. The world market was going down a lot recently which was why OPEC and other oil producing countries decided to cut production. Some domestic prices were still going up.
6614 2018-12-15 18:02:58 You can use butter, or if you want to go healthy, you can use olive oil.
6615 2018-12-15 18:02:56 Fair enough.  I wrote my masters research on the theory of oil storage.  Not saying that makes me an expert.   But perhaps knowledgeable enough to reply on twitter.  I certainly learned from some pretty bright people in the industry, Ed Hirs is one of them.

6618 2018-12-15 18:02:46 Grapeseed oil is processed from grape seeds, which are an abundant byproduct of winemaking.
6619 2018-12-15 18:02:36 Maybe try coconut oil, especially if you're frying. It kind of has similar consistencies. Ghee is clarified butter and could be subbed with butter for most recipes.

6625 2018-12-15 18:01:25 I forgot Norway, Finland, and dozens of others with nationalized oil industries are just in shambles, it's a fact that state owned enterprises just kill economies. Definitely not just Venezuela being single commodity petrostate with no diversity in the economy as oil prices tank.

"Wait? You make cookies from cabals?... Is it a new trend to make cookies from Dead cabals?"

6629 2018-12-15 18:00:50 Understand what? Someone owning the oil and gas market for years will not have that amount of money then who will? And "data is the new oil" statement was made after Ambani showed the country how to gain profit from it.

6632 2018-12-15 18:00:41 It's going to be a painful process. Could even go lower in the short term. A lot of psychological damage and forced liquidation. Market fundamental are lagging, but will come on strong. Still expected tight differentials as Canadian oil is going to have strong demand, not LTO.

6636 2018-12-15 18:00:24 i need some new wipers and its time for my oil change..and more bills to pay.
6637 2018-12-15 18:00:23 I hate taking my car in for an oil change because the technicians always remind me of the $1500 of work my car needs done. Until it’s not safe to drive, it doesn’t need fixin’. And also when I can afford to fix it I will.

6651 2018-12-15 17:58:55 I hear you - we just ran out of heating oil and can't get any until next Thursday

So glad you're suffering as means you're back in the land of the miserable with the rest of us
6652 2018-12-15 17:58:54 - selling out indigenous communities for oil and gas
- massive expansion of the surveillance state 
- referring to black protestors as "t**gs" and failing to take action on mass incarceration 

That's just a few off the top of my head. I am still missing thousands of examples.
6653 2018-12-15 17:58:48 So in Star Wars, water is a precious commodity on Tatooine, but the Skywalkers are rolling in enough oil that Threepio can fully immerse himself in an oil bath? 
6654 2018-12-15 17:58:42 So even if you were right, you’d still be wrong about so much, and sticking with oil and coal will doom us to economic catastrophe even if it didn’t doom us to ecological catastrophe.
6655 2018-12-15 17:58:39 I support Brett. He is helping give a voice to the vast majority of of Albertans that support AB’s oil and gas workers. He may be a little harsh but not wrong. If a Canadian protestor breaks the law while being paid by foreign Tides Foundation then that is treason against 
6656 2018-12-15 17:58:31 The oil industry bent the ear of the pm. He has been bribed and corrupted! There is plenty of money that is not used. For every homeless person in the U.S. 2 speculative sit vacant. Money is wasted on the rich. Oil industry has turned Nigeria into hell for its inhabitants!

6666 2018-12-15 17:56:53 Hard has a similar view. And also take so much oil... I think today isn't going farther than D2/D3.
6667 2018-12-15 17:56:53 Trump would drain the SPR if he could. They just pulled 13Mb out of it recently but planned it well in advance to call it mischief. Whoever is in control of the SPR should be filling it now with shale oil instead of sending it to refineries. Lower gas glut.
6668 2018-12-15 17:56:50 I can't believe how well that works. It's as good as swearing in Irish by saying (in your normal voice) "whale oil beef hooked"
6669 2018-12-15 17:56:49 Awesome Sauce. Now I'm sure you'd feel better with a lil Phyrexian oil. You might feel slightly...mechanical..but you'd be juuuust fiine...yeah...just fine.

6674 2018-12-15 17:55:43 What about Krill oil?  And how much to take?
6675 2018-12-15 17:55:23 Does the cbd oil have THC? What dosage? You feel it what, a couple hours after dosing? What do you feel? 

(I have so many questions!)
6676 2018-12-15 17:55:19 Yet you still don't see the hypocrisy that Noam Chomsky pointed out when the "election interference" story broke?

6686 2018-12-15 17:54:40 #Solarpunkchat A6: a different point of view on the world would still exist, so even if the commerce of oil would be marginalized and become basically a luxury, there would still be smuggling and this would give new meaning to Black Market...
6687 2018-12-15 17:54:20 I cook with a ton of avocado oil and butter so I wipe my down pretty often. I don’t think every time though
6688 2018-12-15 17:54:15 Me too. I somehow doesn’t like it’s taste. I only use it when I make Avial or Pulissery. I am hearing a lot of good things about Avocado and grapeseed oils. Especially Avocado seems to have that nutty taste so hoping it would taste more or less like peanut oil.

6739 2018-12-16 23:56:22 We're not victims.  What always gets us is an oil price crash, we moan about our troubles, and what always resolves them is oil price recovery. So we can cry about not having pipelines when we need them, but without real change, the next price crash will do it to us again

6747 2018-12-16 23:55:01 thank you for reminding me! i forgot to take my CBD oil this morning so i think that might be why it’s so bad today.
6748 2018-12-16 23:54:53 What natural resources exactly? They aren't sitting on oil.
6749 2018-12-16 23:54:45 I very much approve. Olbas Oil is one of my all-time favourite smells.
6750 2018-12-16 23:54:43 This is great... We have cooperation with European about cultivated of oil palm, can increase production and marketed in a free trade. Also can promote the development of renewable energy...

6753 2018-12-16 23:54:13 That giant railyard pic I posted above? How do you think it gets paid for? By car buyers. Everything you see there, every fancy dealership building, every "free fresh baked cookie" you eat while waiting for oil changes, comes from CONSUMER pockets.
6754 2018-12-16 23:54:01 congrats, we’re doing excellent on unemployment and job creation, and we’re no longer a net importer of oil.

have fun with your solyndra tho.

6756 2018-12-16 23:53:28 Line 9 ends in Montreal. The Valero refinery near Quebec City still receives oil by tanker. Montreal no longer receives any oil by tanker.

6758 2018-12-16 23:53:23 Sorry, I’ve segued again. Chickpeas, olive oil and tahini. Often sold with the title “classic” to differentiate from all the stupid variants you can now get.

It is perfect and the best.
6759 2018-12-16 23:53:20 this place in Spokane sells exclusively like olive oil and I don't even cook but I want to buy the whole store.
6760 2018-12-16 23:53:18 This story is irrelevant. How old is it?  GM plant shutdown in ON, thousands of oil field jobs disappearing, call centre in the east shuts down.  I’m sure the next time the numbers are looked at, it’ll be a largely different situation and yes...thanks to our horrendous govt.

6767 2018-12-16 23:52:26 The splashy QC imports ZERO Saudi oil from Butts & Friends looks better than the reality. QCers buy refined petroleum products that come from Saudi & Middle Eastern sources via NB. Most refineries buy from USA & Canada. #FactsMatter #EvenTheOnesYouOmit
6768 2018-12-16 23:52:26 do all Mexican moms hate on canola oil for smelling like "fritanga" or is it just mine?
6769 2018-12-16 23:52:25 Oil marketers have been paid. (News)

So we fine this year.
6770 2018-12-16 23:52:17 But IMF-imposed austerity & restructuring *preceded* massive inflation and unemployment, following the 70s oil shock, which affected every economy, but decimated every developing one. And then policies of almost complete de-socialism in 88/89 preceded the violence and breakup
6771 2018-12-16 23:52:01 destiny has a lot of weird lore

like the fact that their currency is just material that can be used as fuel/power

like theyre literally using fuckin coal or oil or batteries in ziplock baggies as currency
6772 2018-12-16 23:51:58 What kind of fuckin name is “Olive Oil”?
6773 2018-12-16 23:51:43 I said they were competent technical managers. They were really good at running the oil sector. They were a technical rather than a moneyed elite and should have been brought into line rather than ejected.
6774 2018-12-16 23:51:38 Again oil and gas powers this world and has the potential to create huge economic opportunities for this country.  Unfortunately labour and the greens only know how to drain the economy and actually make life more difficult for poor people.
6775 2018-12-16 23:51:32 Blows my mind that people believe congressmen who take millions from oil companies over people whose career is dedicated to studying the climate when it comes to climate change
6776 2018-12-16 23:51:28 I’ve definitely been there. Those were the post baby oil gel days
6777 2018-12-16 23:51:22 I saw. You saw the other graph. Picking out a singular country to point out something made by others can occasionally lead to a much bigger “oversight”. And as other graph shows, only in 2018 when AB oil price constrained did QC all of sudden start buying large. Coincidence?
6778 2018-12-16 23:51:21 #Reagan was deeply indebted to the oil companies; Bush had made his own fortune as an oilman. And most of the key players and cabinet members in these two administrations were either part of the oil industry or were part of the engineering and construction companies so tied to it
6779 2018-12-16 23:51:10 It’s poorly mixed scrambled egg that has been placed  in a Bain  Marie container , possibly sprayed with oil and cooked on steam for 30 minutes , then left in hot holding for possibly an hour then mixed and served . At best . Definitely murdered . Possibly powdered eggs too
6780 2018-12-16 23:51:02 ไม่ชอบฝันอันนี้ที่สุดเลยอีสัดดดดด
6781 2018-12-16 23:50:49 So that you get extra oil in hell or something. Or don't at all if you stop being a fag.
6782 2018-12-16 23:50:32 Says it gets to 900 degrees. I don’t have a laser thermometer to check but it was very hot. Gotta lessen the oil on the edges but the blackened parts were still good. Takes about 90 seconds to cook a pie.
6783 2018-12-16 23:50:30 Can we tell who the ultimate consumer of the Saudi (and Russian and Nigerian, etc) oil is?
6784 2018-12-16 23:50:26 White candles, diffuser with eucalyptus oil, chocolate fountain.

6788 2018-12-16 23:50:12 'I'll get an oil change tomorrow,' I say to myself for the third month in a row.
6789 2018-12-16 23:50:08 Given the fact that our country possesses the fourth largest oil reserves in the world, and we have the most highly regulated energy industry on the planet, the fact that we import ANY oil is absurd and idiotic.
6790 2018-12-16 23:50:02 Don’t you think NZ should produce as much oil and gas as it uses?
6791 2018-12-16 23:49:59 Oreganol P73 oil and Congaplex

6794 2018-12-16 23:49:40 Just fyi castor oil (and I think also nut tree oil) helps hair grow back faster and healthier. I regretted it the second time I did that

6798 2018-12-16 23:48:53 Yum! Girl, your gf oat-flour based recipes rock. my. world.  My dang body recently developed wheat & gluten intolerance. But instead of being bummed I’m JAZZED that my vegan baking skills get to grow more! So QUESTION. Could I sub applesauce for oil in your other muffins? 
6799 2018-12-16 23:48:53 Maple fucking syrup or motor oil
6800 2018-12-16 23:48:44 They came for jobs period.  Not only oil & gas.
6801 2018-12-16 23:48:40 SOS I need an oil change but I have no idea where to go or what to do
6802 2018-12-16 23:48:37 Today I found out I handle the death of a loved one better than I handle not having enough vegetable oil for dinner.
6803 2018-12-16 23:48:21 Let he or she (politician (Conservative, Liberal, NDP, etc) activist, oil exec., environmentalist, journalist (right or left leaning) etc, etc, etc. . . ) who has not distorted the facts, cast the first stone.
6804 2018-12-16 23:48:20  and they say it's cost-effective because the Muppet would only take 10 billion dollars to create another 14 if they put it on every network primetime 
6805 2018-12-16 23:48:13 I would do the same; enjoying the Alberta oil money pouring in thru federal government under Equalization 
6806 2018-12-16 23:48:09 Really? Can they protect the water ways with their tiny navies? 

How are you they going to sell oil when Iran blocks off half the ports?
6807 2018-12-16 23:48:06 duterte allies desperately scrambling for spoils of the war in time to oil their election war chest
6808 2018-12-16 23:48:05 No, what's wrong is billions of our tax money being paid as incentatives to profitable oil companies and un necessary tax cuts to wealthy. Our tax money should be for betterment of American people including healthcare, living wage etc. Ass backwards GOP put profit over people.

6813 2018-12-16 23:47:40 Please consider disinvestment from the oil and gas sectors.  We can be a positive force for climate change! #SUCKITGOP
6814 2018-12-16 23:47:32 I think my biggest L to this day is when I got my oil changed and filled up my gas tank and proceeded to total my car literally 10 miles later 
6815 2018-12-16 23:47:30 I hope some of the money raised can utilised in your continued work in understanding EEHV, and the fantastic initiative to raise awareness regarding palm oil production.
6816 2018-12-16 23:47:24 I see this as victim blaming but I'm sure we'll agree to disagree here. The Feds are the MVP in AB not getting this resource to market while many provinces continue to rely on conflict oil. That plays a part.
6817 2018-12-16 23:47:01 i feel so educated telling people about the horny purposes of fractionated coconut oil
6818 2018-12-16 23:46:51 This vitamin E oil I got for hair smells so good  I oil my scalp at least once a day, my hair just soaks it up !

6821 2018-12-16 23:46:29 Oh. My. God. The charcoal nose strips ARE AMAZING!!! I have a preteen son, who has a little line of black heads/major oil on the bridge of his nose, and I've tried everything to get it off. I was skeptical of the product, but wow. Nose strips have come a long way! Bravo!

6824 2018-12-16 23:46:07 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
6825 2018-12-16 23:46:07 @NourishingWorld can we take high vitamine butter oil with the skate oil?

Or is it just recommended to take with the cod oil?
6826 2018-12-16 23:45:48 “They can’t eliminate palm oil exports so easily because demand is very high,” Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita told reporters. “If it’s suddenly stopped, then what about Unilever detergent? We don’t want to be the target of a negative campaign all the time.”
6827 2018-12-16 23:45:34 I hope they are protesting against the end of subsidies to the oil industry, a raise in the minumum wage and a more compassionate immigration system for asylum seekers like they are doing in France.

6832 2018-12-16 23:45:01 finna do this hot oil treatment when I get home
6833 2018-12-16 23:44:56 Quebec get Alberta oil through Enbridge Line 9. We send a lot of heavy oil their way and they refine it. Google it! Enbridge reversed that line quite awhile ago and now it’s totally west to east.
6834 2018-12-16 23:44:44 Sorry I do not understand. Equalization payments are made by wealthy provinces to poorer provinces. Historically Quebec was poor. But not today. Also Quebec revenue from James Bay (an enviro disaster) is excluded from these payments while oil/gas revenue in the west is included.
6835 2018-12-16 23:44:44 That’s fancy talk and sounds good but the fundamentals (haha “fundamentals”) have significantly turned me bullish on Oil for next year
6836 2018-12-16 23:44:40 OIL（/◎＼）ｺﾞｸｺﾞｸ
(//∇//)\有難うございますっ！
6837 2018-12-16 23:44:39 So @francoislegault our dirty Alberta oil, which actually happens to be some of the most environmentally friendly and ethically produced in the world, isn’t acceptable to Quebec but that ‘clean’ stuff from Saudi Arabia is, right? You hypocritical piece of crap. #quebechypocrisy

6842 2018-12-16 23:44:17 Rosemary and Olive Oil has got to be one of the most iconic pairings of all time.

6845 2018-12-16 23:44:00 thank God I was using that castor oil and anti breakage oil before I got my hair done
6846 2018-12-16 23:43:55 Hows the oil look? Seeing any leaks?
6847 2018-12-16 23:43:51 I just got tea tree oil in my eye  fuuucckkk
6848 2018-12-16 23:43:34 It's understandable. The country's income which is chiefly based on oil price has degenerated since PDP days. Not everyone is unintelligent.
6849 2018-12-16 23:43:22 Bring your conference to the heart of oil sands - I’d be pleased to help host.
6850 2018-12-16 23:43:21 BTW, your #4 response above wasn't very positive and life-coachy. Better take time to reflect on your tweet. You can do better. (See, anyone can be a "life-coach." It's the modern equivalent to a snake oil salesman...)

6854 2018-12-16 23:42:21 Chocolate chips are the oil of the earth.
6855 2018-12-16 23:42:13 Yes and more to the point what are chip shop chips fried in? Palm oil.
6856 2018-12-16 23:42:01 Always change the oil in your car when it’s time and get your teeth cleaned religiously twice a year.
6857 2018-12-16 23:41:50 I hope so too, but I doubt it because how is that possible when you have one Party whose loyalty is to one man and one Party, and the other Party’s loyalty is to country? It’s like mixing oil and water.
6858 2018-12-16 23:41:45 We don't produce enough oil to meet demand & thus we have to import oil to meet the remaining demand. I don't know about you, but I don't want to keep buying oil from Saudi Arabia. I'd rather keep that money in this country & put Americans to work.
6859 2018-12-16 23:41:45 I would say eco styler with olive oil.

6868 2018-12-16 23:41:02 Wait nvm. Had to do a oil change but I can leave my car here take a nap THEN come back for my car :)
6869 2018-12-16 23:40:54 I think Bush Sr was in cahoots with the scum, that's why I never liked him or his sons. Globalism is a cancer to this world. People and cultures are all different, most are like water and oil, they just will not mix. The elite like it because they can hide behind walls, we can't.
6870 2018-12-16 23:40:54 Hey, if I had the time, and know the language, I might consider going. It's US and Columbian sanctions that are the main cause of such squeezes, because they don't like the fact that corporations based in the US and Europe can't exploit the oil.

6875 2018-12-16 23:40:40 Mostly the eastern US, but yes, some goes to Atlantic Canada, Quebec and Ontario. It's the biggest oil refinery in Canada. Also, almost all the natural gas in NB goes by pipeline to the eastern US.

6911 2018-12-16 23:35:27 But castor oil and coat your lashes every night. Should help grow faster.
6912 2018-12-16 23:35:22 Can we cut them off?  Maybe they can use methane producing horses to pull their SUVs around for them. They don’t deserve any Alberta oil.
6913 2018-12-16 23:35:21 In the Permian WTI production did actually decline, only condensate production did grow. Most production growth came from heavy oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Companies are spending like mad, yet make huge (non cash)losses. Yet, please carry on investing. I am staying out.
6914 2018-12-16 23:35:20 Where is the despised Saudi oil?
6915 2018-12-16 23:35:15 I will score you third in the debate, you had low pts, one was your shaky tone in some case. 
Your high pts were 
your opening remarks "solid"
your response to PYO on SMEs
your restructuring plans from a local govt angle
your insistence to look away from oil
your subsidy response
6916 2018-12-16 23:35:10 Snake oil salesman!
6917 2018-12-16 23:35:00 it's all a big conspiracy by big oil and the incumbent car manufacturers trying to stop the EV future!
6918 2018-12-16 23:34:57 No shade but I went from someone who couldn't even hand wash his own car to someone who can change my oil, rotate my tires, fix my spark plugs AND will pump my gas/start my car for me on cold days. And he's one attractive son of a gun too
6919 2018-12-16 23:34:30 an oil exec will just take his place, next will be worse
6920 2018-12-16 23:34:25 @Prohibition Do you sell CBD oil or gummies in your Montreal stores? Thanks.
6921 2018-12-16 23:33:59 What a load of tosh. You’re a snake oil salesman.
6922 2018-12-16 23:33:59 People have their assets frozen when they are American citizens accused of a crime involving those assets. Just taking oil from another country and not paying for it because we think they suck is different. We froze it until they completed their end of the bargain.
6923 2018-12-16 23:33:53 We know that the endgame May is placed to oversee on behalf of the tax dodging hedge funded media, oil and war barons is one which avoids human rights and financial regulations. ..

If Corbyn can't or won't acknowledge this we must #Dissolvetheunion as a matter of urgency!
6924 2018-12-16 23:33:49 Hate to break it to you Brock oil demand will continue for years to come. So you can drive your tesla(which I love) into the forest and stay there.
6925 2018-12-16 23:33:48 Tar Sands bitumen requires a new Refinery - NO one willing to build one for that sort of "oil". Not worth it.
6926 2018-12-16 23:33:47 Avoiding palm oil in foods + chocolates is THE BEST DIET EVER it’s so easy to loose weight, help the environment + save money all at once!
Whenever I tried to loose weight in the past I obsessed about food. Not eating foods which pile on the pounds for environmental reasons works
6927 2018-12-16 23:33:38 My piss is clear, I am covered in coconut oil and eating organic food 

I have no room for hood niggas with McDonald’s dick !
6928 2018-12-16 23:33:38 I need a wax/oil cart plug like yesterday. #helpabrothaout
6929 2018-12-16 23:33:38 Trudeau leads with that but his actions speak differently. He's been caught on camera "mansplaining" he endorses Saudi oil which is a country known for oppression of women. He says construction workers are a danger to women, yet he's groped a reporter.
6930 2018-12-16 23:33:38 Oil Kings Dylan Guenther putting on a clinic in the first period! Two goals so far off beautiful shots

First overall pick in 2018 looking more than comfortable out there #OilKings

6932 2018-12-16 23:33:11 AMLO's using taxpayer money to build a $8.6bn oil refinery and a $6bn train, without a single environmental impact study for either. He also supports keeping coal and diesel-fired power plants open, and opposes tenders for clean energy. This is what's driving me to despair.
6933 2018-12-16 23:33:02 3-1 Oil Kings. Dylan Guenther.

6937 2018-12-16 23:32:48 พี่ทหารร้องไห้แล้วค่ะ5555555
6938 2018-12-16 23:32:45 Have you noticed that you are told to move or that you are a *&%# traitor if you don't think the oil industry is King in Alberta.  The mere suggestion that oil may not always reign supreme send some into a cataleptic rage.
6939 2018-12-16 23:32:39 No doubt he cleaned it with Trump Gun Cleaning Oil.
6940 2018-12-16 23:32:18 Trump said “take the oil”
6941 2018-12-16 23:32:12 EE needed a Refinery to process Tar Sands bitumen. NO ONE was willing to build a refinery for dirty cheap "oil".  AB ignores this important fact.
6942 2018-12-16 23:31:42 And what’s wrong with making money when we don’t have oil money to commit fraud. The people that are pouring oil money into your club go back and check the rate of poverty at the country they came from.
6943 2018-12-16 23:31:31 Awww an oil and gas baby that denounced corporate cash to run for Senate knowing he'd lose. Wonder why Beto became so popular? Wait because he took no corporate money ??? Bernie way? Mmmm lol thanks for proving my points again and again..
6944 2018-12-16 23:31:22 I assume Hitch was around $3M? Regardless, you are likely correct that they did not call Q. Same Oil mgmt as always, set their eyes on one guy and didn’t talk to anyone else.
6945 2018-12-16 23:31:16 What flavor vape oil are you leaving out for Santa this year?
6946 2018-12-16 23:31:10 John, you mean BIG OIL will be ready, and those pipeline companies who slipped you a ton.
6947 2018-12-16 23:31:01 2 things I learned today:
- coconut oil is a really good makeup remover/cleanser 
- checking your bank account constantly will prevent you from assuming you have any money. #iambroke #hellomroverdraft #ishouldnothavegotthatpizza
6948 2018-12-16 23:30:57 おはみくり
6949 2018-12-16 23:30:56 If your pan is seasoned correctly a little soap won’t hurt it.  After many uses the oil coats the pan, the heat changes the consistency of the oil. A little soap won’t kill it.
6950 2018-12-16 23:30:55 I thought Quebec got half of their oil from Alberta since that pipeline reversal a while back.  I try to stay out of it, the politics get so toxic! 
6951 2018-12-16 23:30:54 Please only report on “rappers” when they perish in a rediculous manner, such as falling off a pier, found floating in an oil drum or gets shot at a strip club.
6952 2018-12-16 23:30:51 I can think of three reasons:
1. Oil
2. Oil
3. Oil.
6953 2018-12-16 23:30:51 Hot oil poured on ur legs ????
The last time I heard that, it was John that experienced that before writing Revelation o. What a miracle!?!?! Much love sis.

6956 2018-12-16 23:30:37 So what Simon Bridges is promising by confirming more oil exploration if National are re-elected is to doom NZ to catastrophic climate change #nzpol
6957 2018-12-16 23:30:29 Anti protest law applies to Political summits such as G20. Not common protesting.Struck down Cold war Era anti Propoganda law that blocked even LEGITIMATE broadcasters.

6959 2018-12-16 23:30:27 If you’d actually do some research on the use of Saudi oil you’d know that the last time Quebec used oil from SA was some 12 yrs ago but 80% of it’s petroleum products originate in Canada. Saudi oil is refined in NB & shipped to US market.
6960 2018-12-16 23:30:24 Why don't you guys take this "opportunity" to pump massive federal government support to try to diversify Alberta's economy away from oil? I think the whole country including Alberta would look favorably at that.
6961 2018-12-16 23:30:17 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
6962 2018-12-16 23:30:12 /rlt/ muka gw kan berminyak ya, gw pake facial wash nipea man oil control dan whitening. Gw make selalu pagi2 sebelum berangkat kampus. Gw berangkat kampus pake motor, pas di kampus tuh masih cakep tapi pas dah jam 11 keatas muka gw berminyak lagi. Apa itu tanda2 ga cocok?
6963 2018-12-16 23:30:01 African Black Soap and dilute castor oil has been the one and only thing that fixed my complexion completely.
6964 2018-12-16 23:29:57 Vegan the better  Without palm oil or palm oil of a different name even greater 
6965 2018-12-16 23:29:54 True democracy is gone, this province has been the ugly step sister for too long, this country is too vast and the PM and certain eastern premiers are so 2 faced, oh we don’t want your dirty oil/pipelines blah blah, but we’ll force you to give us $$, enough is enough
6966 2018-12-16 23:29:53 Snake. Oil. Salesman.
6967 2018-12-16 23:29:41 I was supposed to get an oil change 1100 miles ago...
6968 2018-12-16 23:29:21 You get oil for head abeg
6969 2018-12-16 23:29:00 It's absolutely wild to me that something as avant-garde as Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides could get nominated for a Grammy but damn am I glad it did
6970 2018-12-16 23:29:00 “you look like you need to go down to jiffy lube and get the oil changed in your hair”

why does my dad roast me every day of my life
6971 2018-12-16 23:28:53 You should take some fish oil supplements before your next time on Capitol Hill.  Get that memory working.  200+ dimes “I don’t remember”.  You’re a disgusting disgrace to the office you once held!!

6973 2018-12-16 23:28:51 As soon as you add white wine & olive oil to the aldi pesto sauce it turns into a rich silky smooth pasta sauce
6974 2018-12-16 23:28:50 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

6982 2018-12-16 23:28:02 Without oil Saudi Arabia would be a barren desert populated by nomadic tribes, shepherds sheep & camels governed by fear & an archaic code of ethics.
With oil they became unimaginably rich...
BUT STILL LIVE BY 7TH CENTURY VALUES, EYE 4 EYE, WOMEN R CHATTEL.
6983 2018-12-16 23:27:41 As Canada is carbon neutral or negative, you can only lobby against the worst polluters. China, India, Arab oil.  Or stop buying their goods.  #cdnpoli
6984 2018-12-16 23:27:34 Why we keep selling oil with dollar
6985 2018-12-16 23:27:30 And, if you think that is because Saudi oil offends their tender sensibilities, think again. It is cost pure and simple. You'd do best not to imply any higher senses of Quebec morality in that situation.
6986 2018-12-16 23:27:27 Unsweetened almond oil
6987 2018-12-16 23:27:25 Isn't the Lurpak butter and canola oil?
6988 2018-12-16 23:27:18 Canola clear fry oil would be my recommendation ... although I haven’t tried it personally, I have several customers that will only use canola.
6989 2018-12-16 23:27:17 Oil and vinegar no college.
6990 2018-12-16 23:27:15 What happens when you find/ deport 1 and 2 more come in..

6995 2018-12-16 23:26:16 I get your point. However, "Misleading" does not mean untrue. My point with the thread is that Harper did not consult with anyone other than the oil industry on any of his environmental changes before he rammed Bills C38/C45 through.
6996 2018-12-16 23:26:12 It’s like no one remembers this country was built on hemp. CBD oil is great but there is so much more that is about sustainable living re this plant.
6997 2018-12-16 23:25:38 you're a voter, no? am just asking that Mistress/ everyone Not vote for big oil, fracking candidates. that's it, won't bother you again.
6998 2018-12-16 23:25:25 I've come to love it. It's oil (or maybe acrylic, i guess), quite big, and sort of this dark, haunting image of nude women in a forest? It's a bit abstract so it's kind of up for interpretation, but that's my read. Signed Laub-Novak '64. Again, no one cares. Except for you!!!!
6999 2018-12-16 23:24:51 A Historic 150,000 acres of land in Utah was auctioned off by trump to an oil fracking company. Why not tweet about that? And as you know the land sits next to a Forest. I'm sure the wildlife is gonna love having oil pumps and drilling going on in their HOME.
7000 2018-12-16 23:24:50 We pay taxes and as citizens have a right to a say in how our tax money is  used.Major oil companies are still getting billions in incentives (our tax money)when they've long been profitable and not been start up companies. Then theres that unnessary huge tax cut for wealthy.
7001 2018-12-16 23:24:47 this anxiety ridden dog was going INSANE, gave her some hemp oil and the puppy has finally chilled out. Thank god!!
7002 2018-12-16 23:24:30 Dinner, just pan fried boneless chicken breasts in coconut oil...   
7003 2018-12-16 23:24:14 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
7004 2018-12-16 23:24:06 As a climate change sub, I know catastrophic warming is inevitable in the next 40 years but I still think I should be forced to give up all of my fossil fuel based comforts by a big, strong government who tells me I’m a naughty bad oil chugging consumer slave
7005 2018-12-16 23:24:00 Well as at today we are still importing PMS and what was the exchange rate when he talked about subsidy being fraud. The peculiar scenario we find ourselves is that anytime there is crude oil price increase the differential will go up so that we can continue to buy at #145/ltr
7006 2018-12-16 23:24:00 Someone just made +2.17% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 51.249 → 51.325 (20x leverage)  ~ AWWWWW $WTICO $USD
7007 2018-12-16 23:23:56 Yep...and I guess Quebec is okay with purchasing oil from a bunch of woman oppressing LGBT persecuting savages instead of supporting their own country. Pathetic.
7008 2018-12-16 23:23:46 Basically the theory i'm operating on... every good has a (real) long run price and i can't imagine oil is at it right now
7009 2018-12-16 23:23:45 I have to say CBD oil is pretty awesome
7010 2018-12-16 23:23:42 The Irving’s import oil from Saudi.....all refineries in the East are Irving, I think. Apparently Quebec has not used Saudi oil since about 2006. I can’t swear to that date, but it’s close.
7011 2018-12-16 23:23:42 Well as at today we are still importing PMS and what was the exchange rate when he talked about subsidy being fraud. The peculiar scenario we find ourselves is that anytime there is crude oil price increase the differential will go up so that we can continue to buy at #145/ltr
7012 2018-12-16 23:23:18 Get some oil of oregano.  It tastes awful, but three drops under your tongue will kill respiratory infections in no time. Feel better!
7013 2018-12-16 23:23:10 Oil Kings regain their lead on the power play.

7014 2018-12-16 23:23:08 My car needs an oil change. Am I allowed to use the oil on my face, or do I have to pay for it
7015 2018-12-16 23:23:00 I'm up for a cordite and hydraulic oil scent in the morning. Smells like not walking.
7016 2018-12-16 23:22:56 Cerave OR just jojoba oil
7017 2018-12-16 23:22:55 Knock knock, do you have a minute to talk about our Lord and Savior, tea tree oil?
7018 2018-12-16 23:22:23 lololol, it's chugging MCT oil all over again
7019 2018-12-16 23:22:16 While doing some postgame editing, we’ve heard several passes of a low-flying helicopter around Lucas Oil Stadium. Wonder if it’s search crews out looking for the #Cowboys offense. #DALvsIND #Colts #HowBoutThemColts #NFL @WTHRcom
7020 2018-12-16 23:22:02 Almost $90 for an oil change ain’t it
7021 2018-12-16 23:21:45 A lot of ignorance about hemp (CBD). .3% thc. You could smoke an acre of the stuff and not get high. And it reduces inflammation which causes pain,  reduces/eliminates seizures, etc. Doctors with patients that use CBD oil have seen the proof.
7022 2018-12-16 23:21:27 Not just Trump but the Koch brothers and all other American billionaires who what everything for themselves. Corporate Welfare, Tax Cuts, America’s minerals and oil, state legislatures.

オリーブ栽培・オリーブ油発祥の地は
地中海沿岸です
7024 2018-12-16 23:21:13 Garlic roasted broccoli, asparagus mushroom and maybe a potato? Smoked salmon on a slice of toasted pumpernickle with an olive oil drizzle on the side if you’re feeling really hongry.
7025 2018-12-16 23:21:12 My dad told me that my brother was using CBT oil and it's really helped his pain.
I must find out what he's taking.
7026 2018-12-16 23:20:59 It's not our country that doesn't believe in science. It's just propaganda from Trump.. The Russian oil shill.
7027 2018-12-16 23:20:58 cheap gasoline in USA, that is all cheeto wants from SA.  if SA's oil fields dried up, cheeto/USA would have nothing to do with SA royal family or country itself.
7028 2018-12-16 23:20:50 The Rick Flairs take this one with a 14-2 Final.
7029 2018-12-16 23:20:49 Mmmm took care of a car that my Grammy left me. Its first oil change in 11000.
7030 2018-12-16 23:20:46 So now suddenly Quebec DOES import oil? You just told me you didn’t.

Now why, again, are you folks protesting getting oil from your own country? Would you rather it come from the US or some other place?
7031 2018-12-16 23:20:37 En Miniso, hay varias pero unas de caja negra que dicen que tiene tea tree oil control. Compré esas y me funcionaron.
7032 2018-12-16 23:20:02 Actually that's not true, Gerry just fires up the old printing press and we just print as much money as we need...its that easy
 And! Thats! Why! We have fluishing oil and gas industry and we have low unemployment and are able to give away billions around the world.
7033 2018-12-16 23:19:27 B Fox added one for the Oilers in the 3rd.
7034 2018-12-16 23:19:25 Quebec imports a ton of oil from the U.S. and pays a premium price. Price for Western oil is at least $30 cheaper because no pipelines. Could look at other provinces too.
7035 2018-12-16 23:19:23 Lots of opportunity in Texas. Far from perfect, but a good state to get established. There is decent housing at reasonable prices (tougher in Austin), where you can raise a family and live a decent life. We’re not all cowboys and oil wells here.
7036 2018-12-16 23:19:22 Oil companies are the worst.

7040 2018-12-16 23:18:50 Go Oil Kings Go
7041 2018-12-16 23:18:48 oil and vinegar no children.
7042 2018-12-16 23:18:41 1st of course, fine steel wool to remove old varnish, then rub with good teak oil?
7043 2018-12-16 23:18:40 Re BC, he has complete control of Kinder via the federal purchase.  The end game is the same, stranding Canadian oil.  Whatever it takes.

7049 2018-12-16 23:17:27 He’s the archetypal snake oil salesman. Andrew Bridgen embarrassed himself on BBC5Live when he said he was entitled to an Irish passport because he is English.
7050 2018-12-16 23:17:20 I stole my grandmas cbd oil and I’ve been on a wild trip ever since
7051 2018-12-16 23:17:10 Sorry not quite understanding. Higher prices shifts in the PPF of the economy, as potential output has decreased therefore inflation. In other words M*V is constant, higher oil price reduces Y so P must go up?
7052 2018-12-16 23:17:02 Those who would give up essential Tonalism, to purchase a little temporary Electro house, deserve neither Mustard oil nor Foyer.
7053 2018-12-16 23:16:52 I bought 12 drumsticks yesterday. Washed them. Seasoned with Lawry’s, overnight. Today I threw them in oven to convention bake. No oil use but they so delicious.
7054 2018-12-16 23:16:44 i really need to do this oil change but me finding a jack is impossible
7055 2018-12-16 23:16:37 It's reckoned for every Europe we got from Europe we gave back At least 4 times that in fish stocks estimate d to over 2 billion along with our of shore oil and gas which we have to pay for here is a country whoes leaders sold and betrayed to Europe causing the waste land in west
7056 2018-12-16 23:16:21 Our "friends" in Saudi Arabia are reducing oil output to raise the price per barrel.  Wait a bit, prices will be sky high in no time.

7058 2018-12-16 23:15:52 Don’t buy anything that uses Palm Oil, our rain forests in Brazil & Malaysia are needed for the planets lungs and the chance of losing animals unique to the regions. Orangutan are just one!
7059 2018-12-16 23:15:49 Am I wrong? My understanding was that the EE pipeline was to ship diluted bitumen to New Brunswick where much of it could be loaded on to tankers for export to Asia or wherever, to refineries that could process it. This is not light oil. Who can process it?
7060 2018-12-16 23:15:42 Partly because it's a bad idea. But I'm sure they'd partner up if things got so bad that shipping oil to a partly ice-bound port made sense.  Be clear.... there is NO comparison between them and our Saudi and Venezuelan tanker-lovin' cousins in Quebec when it comes to hypocrisy.
7061 2018-12-16 23:15:34 You Americans have employed every dirty trick in the book to keep Alberta oil in the ground
7062 2018-12-16 23:15:22 Scotland is NOT equal in the UK
and never will be. The English dislike Scots
We are treated like 2nd class Our feelings or views our Country are just ignored
The only reason they want us in the UK is OIL AND GAS
Money UK has squandered on tax cuts to the rich
We need Indyref 2
7063 2018-12-16 23:15:20 An economic and the West is a melting of us Oil is immanent to what thing in a situation is also fulfill it simply mean to
7064 2018-12-16 23:15:18 I don’t think there’s enough oil in the world to reverse all the sexism in Saudi.
7065 2018-12-16 23:15:15 Nope not even close, we’re self sufficient financially, don’t need oil money just it would just be nice to have access to the money we generate ourselves and yes im fully aware ya caught one
7066 2018-12-16 23:15:15 That's not the same as importing dude. They're not the ones importing oil AND IF YOU COULD READ YOUD KNOW THAT REGARDLESS OF PIPELINES THEY'LL STILL BUY FOREIGN OIL

7070 2018-12-16 23:14:26 sooo my oil is leaking..
7071 2018-12-16 23:14:15 So @CBSSports @NFL the transition noise you guys’d use sounds like a squeaky wheel. Can you please put some oil on it and quit it!
7072 2018-12-16 23:14:08 I don't really agree; PDVSA were actually really competent technical managers. Honestly a model for state-owned oil companies. They were also differential to elites, like you'd expect, but gutting them was still a mistake.
7073 2018-12-16 23:14:08 What’s happening to the economy of almost all the major oil producing countries of the world?
Our economy grew at 1.8% which isn’t where we need to be and btw the exact details of that meeting is unknown, just the one that can be used as election weapon.
7074 2018-12-16 23:13:56 そっちの都合かぁ
7075 2018-12-16 23:13:48 Getting near the end of the year. Tax loss selling will offer excellent opportunity for those with conviction. Oil service has been destroyed. Tremendous value in some names. Going over my shopping list.

7084 2018-12-16 23:12:19 No. You change your own oil in your car and you're nice.
7085 2018-12-16 23:12:06 @realDonaldTrump Every barrel of oil exported is a barrel NOT AVAILABLE to future Americans' energy needs.  Petroleum is a STRATEGIC NATURAL RESOURCE and not just a means of revenue.  At the very least, value should be added to raw petroleum by turning it into finished goods HERE
7086 2018-12-16 23:12:02 Palm oil unfortunately

7089 2018-12-16 23:11:58 If you want to paint with acrylics you don’t need to but you may want to if you want to prevent a bit of paint absorption. If oil you should use acrylic gesso for sure.
7090 2018-12-16 23:11:44 Alberta oil and gas have been the main drivers of our economy for decades.  It has created trillions in wealth, billions in revenue, millions of jobs, and one, single Liberal idiot and his master Butts is driving a stake through its heart - on purpose.
7091 2018-12-16 23:11:36 Switch over to CBD oil
7092 2018-12-16 23:11:36 Obama abandoned Eastern Europe and Ukraine especially to Putin. Giving Iran 150 billon doesn’t exactly help the United States. Trumps oil drilling is the most counter Russia you can get. EU is corrupt and in the hands of open borders types, a bully org
7093 2018-12-16 23:11:36 no, but i will buy it to get the oil stain out my garage

7113 2018-12-16 23:09:45 But the Manitoba Premier has not also just indicated that Manitobans are just so keenly sensitive that Alberta oil is just not acceptable in their elevated view of the world. Quebec's has. As you are aware, Albertans accepted "equalization" relatively gracefully for decades.
7114 2018-12-16 23:09:40 All the noise from the honking going by my house is super annoying and making me less likely to Support Oil and Gas. What a terrible idea.
7115 2018-12-16 23:09:24 Yes I work in the oil/gas terminal business as a night shift operator. Taking CS classes at community college and trying to learn as much as I can on my own.

7129 2018-12-16 23:07:41 Drilling rigs and other industry vehicles left Canada to park in Montana because their were no profitable oil prices in the USA either. Funny thing about world oil prices.
7130 2018-12-16 23:07:39 Support for Oil & Gas. A predominant, Canadian heartland industry. Their livelihoods under threat for political reasons.

This is a fallout of deliberate collapsing of our national interests via  #ParisAgreement and #UNmigrationPact fake "emergencies".

7134 2018-12-16 23:07:13 DON'T use oil! Use rubbing alcohol instead and let the alcohol dry completely!! It's an easy fix. MyMateVince has a video about it
7135 2018-12-16 23:07:02 @NancyPelosi  @realDonaldTrump why is trump allowed to advertise trump products that are on sale? The president should NOT be acting like a common snake oil sales man !who keeps the money from the maga hats and those silly presidential coins? He is not a salesman, but ‘president’
7136 2018-12-16 23:06:34 It's a BS point made by Trevor who can spout plenty of details while totally missing the point. QC is blocking interprovincial access.

If Quebec wants to keep using the Bakken Oil that killed so many innocent people in Lac Megantic, that's a choice they can own.

7145 2018-12-16 23:05:53 Pipeline is the safest oil transportation in deed; it's not Québec vs Alberta, it's reason against ecolo-ideologists.
7146 2018-12-16 23:05:52 Oil company lobbyists lies
7147 2018-12-16 23:05:29 It's only the Canadian tankers @JustinTrudeau is banning on the west coast, NOT the 6X as many US tankers that transport oil though the same CDN waters.

7161 2018-12-16 23:03:51 Thx. I'll try to figure it out. Looks like most of the Saudi oil goes to Irving in NB. I'll try to find out how much of that goes to Quebec. I suspect they burn a fair bit of Saudi-origin gasoline in Quebec
7162 2018-12-16 23:03:31 How’s CBD oil work for abandonment issues 

Asking for a friend
7163 2018-12-16 23:03:26 For your mind. Better go open one bottle of olive oil
7164 2018-12-16 23:03:25 I used to use Crisco or bacon grease. Now I use any type of veggie oil even olive oil. I oil both sides of the pan. All of mine are black and well seasoned!
7165 2018-12-16 23:03:24 Yes but no possum knuckles or squirrel oil
7166 2018-12-16 23:03:20 Okay i have most of the Shea moistures products now, it’s kinda hard to use a brush with my hair so i use a pick instead lol & what do you mean seal with an oil?

7169 2018-12-16 23:02:53 Coconut oil + lotion on freshly showered skin = amazing
7170 2018-12-16 23:02:44 I use the Beard Brand Tree Ranger beard oil from grooming lounge, and there is a local company that makes a wonderful beard balm.
7171 2018-12-16 23:02:39 Oil sensor I hope. Or its more serious and I get a special kind present this year for christmas. 
7172 2018-12-16 23:02:39 Grill at 500 degrees. Olive oil minced garlic and ground pepper  on each side. 6 minutes, 1 turn , 4 minutes. Rest 1. Crispy medium rare to die for.
7173 2018-12-16 23:02:31 It goes deeper than that though. The whole attack on PDVSA and the redistribution of its funds has to be recognized as an error now. The demands were legitimate but the project was a failure, as well wrongheaded given the structural weakness of the oil economy.
7174 2018-12-16 23:02:29 おはよぉぉぉ！！
7175 2018-12-16 23:01:45 Garlic and coconut oil is another thing that all females should have. Non-hydrogenated coconut oil. Not only are both great for you internally, external uses could cure things you wouldn’t even think of.

7178 2018-12-16 23:01:29 Do you know, not guessing, how people in Alberta are going to eat.  You put the heart of the oil patch out of work. You keep getting you BS salary, Quebec gets its transfer payments.  This is the crap the west is fed up with. Trudeau is not capable to do the job. Shut up/sit down
7179 2018-12-16 23:01:20 Then Canada must nationalize the oil sector. Otherwise, free market dictates.
7180 2018-12-16 23:01:16 Since oil is underground, Obama should have said "even if we drill every cubic inch of this country..."
Which is why he could not achieve this

7188 2018-12-16 23:00:39 In the first 10 months of 2018, New Brunswick, which has one refinery (Irving Oil) imported $3.1 billion of Saudi crude. Irving says it sends more than half to the USA. The rest goes to other provinces and Quebec.

7191 2018-12-16 23:00:04 Oil fire. Had to sacrifice myself to save the others. Was on 34th floor...half the building would've been in flames before firefighters arrived. 30mins later still no ambulance or fire brigade. Had to have random person drive me to the ER. Been in ICU ever since.
7192 2018-12-16 23:00:01 200F is too low to get a really good season unless you leave it in for the whole day. I do mine on 400-500F for about an hour with vegetable oil on all sides and they are black and shiny as obsidian! Bake them, cut the oven off after an hour, let them stay until the oven cools.

7212 2018-12-16 22:58:04 There has been a momentary loss of market control by the monopolists, with a resulting crash in oil prices, and as a result the Economy of Venezuela which is largely driven by oil exports, is no longer profitable to support the entire economy.
7213 2018-12-16 22:57:56 Mr Kenney is playing with social peace
Its totally irrelevant to oil exports wether Québec likes pipelines or not,since its fédéral

7214 2018-12-16 22:57:53 Would you be referring to the protests, In Calgary, Edmonton, Maritimes?

People are lovely 
7217 2018-12-16 22:57:45 The problem with Venezuela is that the leadership trusted Capitalism to provide a stable source of oil revenue, and Oil is a generally controlled market where prices are largely controlled by monopoly in production.

7323 2018-12-16 22:47:23 If we are tied in to fossil fuels until 2040 we will be on our last legs as a species. Get fully behind an infrastructure for renewables now ... you know, deep down, that's our future, not your mates in the oil and gas industry.
7324 2018-12-16 22:47:17 I've managed to get olbas oil in my eye and I now know the meaning of agony
7325 2018-12-16 22:47:08 Y'all can't even handle my level of chill right now. Got my own oil blend, lava lamp, ambient lighting, velvet throw and so gods damn comfy. I'll be accepting acolyte applications in the new year.
7326 2018-12-16 22:47:01 Was the meal supposed to be yours for eating? If no, just bridle your tongue and go cook yours! Eventually, it's people like who would add palm oil and bitter leave in noodles 
7327 2018-12-16 22:46:55 The solution lies with @CarbonEngineer tech. Making gasoline and any other fuel out of atmospheric carbon. Petroleum carbon based fuels are no longer necessary. In the time it takes to build a pipeline we could move completely past oil use
7328 2018-12-16 22:46:51 I be waiting until I’m about to collapse to cook food, wrist shaking as I’m holding the bottle of olive oil
7329 2018-12-16 22:46:50 just finished changing my car’s oil and it started pouring 5 min after god is real
7330 2018-12-16 22:46:36 Gee, I wonder what we did to deserve all that? Maybe overthrow their prime minister, take control of their oil and prop up a brutal puppet to rule over them? As for hiding "plans for" nukes, which country is the only one to have actually nuked people -- civilians, yet! -- ?
7331 2018-12-16 22:46:33 Can do his own oil change
7332 2018-12-16 22:46:29 @ArgosHelpers Hello. I purchased an oil heater from you a few months ago but it makes clicking noises all the time so I can't sleep with it on  I wasn't expecting it to be this noisy. My friend has one and it doesnt do that.
7333 2018-12-16 22:46:28 Hab 'ne Schicht Aloe Vera Gel drauf, gefolgt von rosehip oil, dann Mango Butter, hyaluronic acid, Shea Butter und mein Gesicht hat immer noch trockene Stellen, juckt und spannt WAS IST DAS DENN
7334 2018-12-16 22:46:06 Snake Oil!
7335 2018-12-16 22:46:01 Le peak oil est arrivé à point nommé. Le pétrole ne se substituera pas très longtemps.
Pour ce qui est de la fusion, c'est surtout le problématique de la production de tritium de va faire surface assez vite et qui va être longue à maîtriser si c'est seulement possible.
7336 2018-12-16 22:45:54 are garlic chips a thing? like potato chips with garlic and butter? i made kale and tossed with some garlic.oil. kinda made kale chips by mistake. just curious
7337 2018-12-16 22:45:45 don't get me wrong I love Beto but dont ignore the facts that he never joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus, instead chose the New Democratic Caucus, which views closer to HRC, said he would rejoin the Paris Deal, but didn't back off oil and gas for AOC's green deal so...
7338 2018-12-16 22:45:41 Olive Oil is playing at Murphs the night that I turn in my marketing porfolio so needless to say im going to rage harder than hard bc this is the perfect ending to my college career & celebration for finishing the semester from hell & god i missed getting murphs type of wasted
7339 2018-12-16 22:45:37 Oh I just realized I was googling oil imported into Canada not Quebec exclusively.
7340 2018-12-16 22:45:36 I just found valve oil in my makeup drawer and I don’t know if I should be proud or disappointed in myself 
7341 2018-12-16 22:45:18 still waiting on the oil
7342 2018-12-16 22:45:05 1. 55
2. Nova Scotia
3. Pay bills, get furnace oil, fill the fridge and freezer, and then sleep without worry.
7343 2018-12-16 22:45:01 Scheer will not stop the oil sands or pipelines. That's it. Seal closed.
7344 2018-12-16 22:44:58 Mr. President, if you were actually trying to do good for the country, I might agree with you. However, you are reversing so many positive things that have been accomplished. You are intent on turning the country into a mean spirited, oil soaked swamp.
7345 2018-12-16 22:44:55 Why does this picture smell like motor oil and provolone cheese?
7346 2018-12-16 22:44:42 Come on you know Trudeau is anti oil and vowed to shut down the oil sands. Don’t soft peddle.
7347 2018-12-16 22:44:19 おはよー！動画で元気になった！
7348 2018-12-16 22:44:18 i'm way over for an oil change and i have to only drive short distances or back to como!!!
7349 2018-12-16 22:44:07 Absolutely.  That's why I add a new reponse every time one of these oil and gas propaganda ads shows up on my feed
7350 2018-12-16 22:43:25 you're right, Mistress. big oil, dirty money and dirty pipelines are indeed "mean".
*I wasn't the person doing the name calling now, was I?*

7352 2018-12-16 22:43:03 Facts do matter Gerald. How much Saudi oil DO we import every day? The point I think is to replace it with our own and also reduce the need to import 50% of the oil Quebec uses. Surely you can understand that.
7353 2018-12-16 22:43:01 Why don't we take the money earmarked for pipelines and invest in solar or wind farms? Why can't we do that in Alberta? Why can't we train oil sands workers to work on solar and wind farms? The experts say this is the growth industry. They also say workers would get higher pay.
7354 2018-12-16 22:42:58 Yes.  Many vitamin stores have it liquid form.  You could also try oregano oil.   Also from a vitamin store.  Vitamin Shoppe is where I go.
7355 2018-12-16 22:42:29 @CarbonEngineer has the technology today to suck atmospheric carbon out of the air and turn it into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel. It burns cleaner and runs better in your engine. We could completely remove oil from the equation in the time it takes to build that thing

7359 2018-12-16 22:42:01 Those oil tankers in Quebec go through water that is used as drinking water by many communities. Stunning hypocracy.
7360 2018-12-16 22:41:50 Wow complete fabrication. It's BIG oil corporations not Quebec. The same corporations you love handing tax breaks to. GOVERNMENTS don't buy oil.
7361 2018-12-16 22:41:49 North Sea Oil and Trident bases say this won't be allowed to happen by "The Crown".
7362 2018-12-16 22:41:46 Hold on, are the Irvings not major customers for Hibernia? Where does Canadian oil from the Atlantic coast get sent for refining?

7365 2018-12-16 22:41:36 Agree but they still should by Canadian oil

7370 2018-12-16 22:40:54 Fiscal deficit
In 2017/18, Scotland’s net fiscal deficit – the difference between estimated revenues and 
public spending – ranges from 9.5% of GDP if North Sea oil and gas are excluded, to 
7.9% of GDP if North Sea revenues are shared on a geographical basis
7371 2018-12-16 22:40:52 Taking Sunday evenings back for body care. Supper is in the oven. I made an exfoliant with sugar, coffee, and coconut oil. Body will get clean, nails and cuticles will be trimmed.

7376 2018-12-16 22:40:17 Snake oil or some kind of roulette
7377 2018-12-16 22:40:16 Who is paying to build all new infrastructure for renewable energy. guarantee the oil company’s won’t and I don’t see any big investors from around the world stepping up in Canada. Guarantee that if the government tried to pay for it, it would be political suicide for that party

7381 2018-12-16 22:39:58 Well done, Grande Prairie is oil country.  600 trucks need to roll into downtown Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal to make an impact.  I’m sure there are many rigs and operators idle.  What would it take to start a GoFundMe campaign to offset costs and get these trucks rolling?
7382 2018-12-16 22:39:58 DO ANOTHER SNAKE OIL PODCAST
7383 2018-12-16 22:39:35 Yup.

If we were gonna do it for the “right” reasons, it would’ve happened 30-40 years ago.

Now it’s cheaper, so even the deniers and oil interests can’t stop it. 


7384 2018-12-16 22:39:33 also with the stranglehold oil barons have on the transportation industry, no they won't
7385 2018-12-16 22:39:33 What a stupid post. Quebec buys the refined oil from NB because they don’t make/refine squat in that province. The NB stuff comes from Saudi. So your post is bs.
7386 2018-12-16 22:39:32 Here's the thing. It's not just the oil industry that's affirmatively doing things to guarantee that civilization will cook itself. Use your vote as if the world depends on it, because it does. Did in 2000 and 2016. Too many people lied to themselves, so they could feel superior.

7389 2018-12-16 22:39:22 CBD Oil where you drip it under your tongue is also the most effective way of doing it as it'll spread out to your body faster and in a better quanitity as it's not dissolved in your stomach at all.
7390 2018-12-16 22:39:18 Wow. Alberta really wants to separate by relying on a soon to be antiquated way of life: oil drilling. Had no idea the West could be this dumb.  #Toronto #Canada

7398 2018-12-16 22:38:25 I'm not too sure about that, the U.S. only cares about the Southeastern part, which has oil
7399 2018-12-16 22:38:25 Trump's cabinet and appointments super white, male, Goldman Sachs, and big oil/energy corporations execs. Selectively focusing on a couple Indian immigrant appointments doesn't undo his launching his campaign and closed midterm arguments with white nativist demagoguery.
7400 2018-12-16 22:38:01 --- wipe down the cabinetry every time with the geranium water, and if there are really bad spots, I go for the oil/vinegar combo --- BUT learned the hard way, come back in ten minutes and see what the area looks like completely dry --- sometimes takes a few buffings.
7401 2018-12-16 22:37:44 I really hate when leftists try to hand wave the problems in Venezuela completely on wreckism and sanctions, it’s a factor but a realy minor one in comparison to the crisis in oil revenue

7407 2018-12-16 22:36:45 What about Saudi Oil being brought into Quebec ?  You never got an answer !!!!!
7408 2018-12-16 22:36:26 My position is none of it’s priced in 

- not lower rates, lower oil or lower PEs

But P will guide us this week

7416 2018-12-16 22:35:36 Actually oil field workers have a kind of unionized law in place that employers cannot just fire them from their jobs without giving them notice 30 days in advance.  Even the shittiest of workers are protected so HR has to do extra just to get rid of them.

7418 2018-12-16 22:35:32 @AlistairBurtUK is the man who signed it. His tweets call Brexiteer MP's some horrendous names. And check his images.. UN 2030 plan all backed by OIL & big business. He came out of retirement in 2017 to put this in motion. May hired him in her reshuffle. Arch remainer.
7419 2018-12-16 22:35:25 Why did he never answer your question about Saudi oil and you never pressed him! What kind of journalist would let that happen?

It is comprehensible our Group Captain did not execute his duty today and led us to a lost battle. You would be selfish not to share your squirrel oil & flattened snake strips with Capt. Dak as this might improve his sidearm before our unit anticipates a new Captain

7428 2018-12-16 22:34:04 Hence the military victory getting less attention than the miracle of the oil lasting a week longer than it should have.
7429 2018-12-16 22:34:04 For frosting I just used powdered sugar and milk and drizzled it over the top before covering to cook. Theres another girl and she made it, she said that it stuck to the sides so before I started I also did a thin coat of olive oil on the crock pot. 
7430 2018-12-16 22:33:55 Exactly blaming someone like when they blamed Notley but Oil prices were out of her control

7440 2018-12-16 22:33:03 Thanks for this bit of Alberta’s oil history.
7441 2018-12-16 22:33:02 1. So good to see! Though I do not work in the Oil & Gas, I understand it reflects on every1 in Alb. Those that cant find jobs in the O&G business usually go back home.  They need a job to support their families.  So they take away jobs that other people maybe more suited for.
7442 2018-12-16 22:32:58 (It was a Campari being engine oil joke)
7443 2018-12-16 22:32:56 Oil will move sideways and therefore OMC are better position for next 3 months. At cmp 344 one can enter and by March expect it to be 400.On can generate a reutrn of 16%. Global demand is not visible but supply is sufficient to keep prices of Brent in the range of 55-60.
7444 2018-12-16 22:32:23 This is just misleading. How much of the US oil they import is actually oil from OPEC countries and delivered via a US pipe? Also, NB gets lots of Saudi oil, refines it and sends it to QC. QC“imports” no Saudi oil may be accurate but to imply they don’t use Saudi oil is false.
7445 2018-12-16 22:32:15 You can come to Berlin it’s basically an all nighter for 70% of a day. Haha. Then again I always considered myself a lover of midnight oil and not just the band.
7446 2018-12-16 22:32:10 The countries that can (temporarily) handle single-payer healthcare are those that are wealthy (i.e. Oil reserves), small, and culturally homogeneous. But eventually you will run out of other people's money.
7447 2018-12-16 22:32:02 This provincial interference on issues that are federal matters. Reminds of squabbling children. Quebec calling Alberta oil socially unacceptable, yet buys oil from the Saudi’s who lure people to embassies to be butchered.
7448 2018-12-16 22:31:45 Pete will never change which is why Ive called for a new HC after last season. He and Russ go together like oil and water. Team Russ for me.

7450 2018-12-16 22:31:43 These stagnant oil prices are somewhat annoying, #OPEC ‘s cut wasn’t good enough honestly.

7458 2018-12-16 22:30:55 @EvanLSolomon enjoyed interview with Trudeau but you let him get away with not answering about stopping Saudi Oil coming into Canada Also next time could U pls ask what "price on pollution" he is putting on the millions of litres of raw sewage they allow 2 be dumped in our water

7460 2018-12-16 22:30:40 Liberals blames the wolves for the decline, so they culled the wolves. But it's clear-cut logging, mining and oil and gas development, which is to blame. Give the cariboo some habitat, so they can survive & hide from predators. It's not too late. NDP can order habitat restoration

In the wake of the plunge Friday, I really wonder how many people had the guts to keep WTI long positions over the weekend.
7464 2018-12-16 22:30:13 There's some debate over the distinction between the oil and the military victories, since it does seem kinda weird to omit any mention of such a stunning and improbable upset. In short, the military victory really only endured for a couple of years. Israel ceded sovereignty...

7469 2018-12-16 22:29:46 I sent a snap to my bf,pointing out my coconut oil hair mask for self care Sunday, and he sent back a pic of him pointing to his gaming headset with self care Sunday too 
7470 2018-12-16 22:29:35 You should commission an oil painting of this.
7471 2018-12-16 22:29:33 ....also, try spot treating with vitamin e oil in the evenings and drink lotsssssss of water. I used to get dry patches on my face and it turned out that I was just dehydrated
7472 2018-12-16 22:29:30 Okay I saw the olive oil on Pinterest but I was confused on how it worked. Is the cotton ball supposed to be soaked or just have a little bit of oil?
7473 2018-12-16 22:29:03 Yee with garlic & olive oil
7474 2018-12-16 22:29:00 Those are my thoughts exactly. However Beto is going to have to come around on universal health care and not supporting oil/gas as much as he did in TX.

7484 2018-12-16 22:27:51 ooooh coconut oil as a replacement? that’s really interesting
7485 2018-12-16 22:27:50 Frances and I was like oil and water but that was a misunderstanding so now we see each other.

7493 2018-12-16 22:26:43 I hated that.
7494 2018-12-16 22:26:42 interesting that this conference would not even be able to happen without fossil fuels. How are the buildings being heated, how were they made.

7498 2018-12-16 22:26:30 Was stripping regulations to increase US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices all part of the collusion, too?

7506 2018-12-16 22:25:29 Elasticity of substitution of crude oil is very, very high.  When we think about trading with "bad countries", need to factor that in.

Welfare for corporations often causes great harm.

7516 2018-12-16 22:24:53 VA's oil is expensive and it has a large pop, that's why it's particularly vulnerable to shocks.
7517 2018-12-16 22:24:53 @michaelmarini94

7535 2018-12-16 22:23:28 Religious obsession unreformed by modern economic reality is holding back proper reform in Saudi Arabia . The best thing for Saudi women would be the end of Saudi wealth. Making Saudis work rather than rely on oil wealth.
7536 2018-12-16 22:23:15 Trickle down economics is just trickle up economics delivered by snake oil salesmen to ailing customers as the cure for all ills.
And the small print on the label, which noone ever reads says ' do not take if you are experiencing poverty'.

7543 2018-12-16 22:22:24 Calgary went with LRT forty years ago. Today they have three lines stretching to the far south, northeast, northwest and west and now three BRT lines linking the LRT system. (Oil money helped a wee bit.)
7544 2018-12-16 22:22:23 Eat or consume? High fat content foods containing oil can easily fill 2k calories
7545 2018-12-16 22:22:10 Not for money. Not for oil!

7548 2018-12-16 22:22:06 Innnnnteresting! I typically just eat it with tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
7549 2018-12-16 22:22:05 Or, par boil, drain, shake in the saucepan, drizzle in some olive oil, season with whatever goes with the meat (I did a bit of salt and garlic powder tonight), chuck 'em on a tray with the rest of the veg because I'm cooking for one, 20 minutes in the oven at 220C and bonza.
7550 2018-12-16 22:22:01 I’m a Functional Coach and I also create plant based recipes.. This one is not, in any manner, appealing to me. I do use coconut oil for a variety of things (it worked in a pinch for a squeaky door hinge I had last wk), but, the thought of eating a ball of it gags me.
7551 2018-12-16 22:21:53 Isn’t the question really;
Why buy foreign oil when we have an abundance of Canadian oil and should be supporting Canadian businesses & provinces ?

7556 2018-12-16 22:20:46 Schear seems to be too thick to understand that rail cars are an interim measure. The construction  of the pipelines that Alberta needs to get its oil to market has been bungled by both the Conservative and Liberal governments. Rail cars are a more timely interim solution.

7562 2018-12-16 22:20:05 The faster 3k breaks the better. What is happening recently in crypto reminds me of the 2014 collapse in oil, with low cost producers trying to push high cost producers out of the market.
7563 2018-12-16 22:20:01 Trudeau and his team can’t even figure out how to sell weed for crying out loud.  If you blow that, image how hard oil and gas, logging, fishing, mining, tech ,etc. etc. is for these . What makes us think they can balance a chequebook?

7567 2018-12-16 22:19:45 I don’t believe I’ve heard a president whine as much as you do. Between the whining, the golf games and your traveling snake oil shows, when do you do any real work?

7570 2018-12-16 22:19:16 It is the hypocrisy of west coast tanker bans whereas the Quebec economy would collapse without tankers.

Production is likely less than 25% of CO2 production- the vast majority is through consumption.

No chance.

7582 2018-12-16 22:17:45 Energy East pipeline was proposed to send Alberta oil through QC to NB for refining. This would have reduced foreign oil being shipped to NB.

And without violently disrupting one of the best state oil companies on earth the economy would have been a lot stronger, so they wouldn't have been necessary in the first place.

7596 2018-12-16 22:15:36 only a little vitamin E oil, castor oil and coconut oil on your eyelashes every night girl! I mix them all in a tiny container, dab my pinky into it and apply it before I go to bed.
7597 2018-12-16 22:15:20 The carbon economy is fading.  New tech & research is happening.  Alternative energy sources are on the way.  We shouldn't be focusing on such things like oil & coal.  In Canada, there is a big issue with pipelines.  Odd that pipelines are a big commotion.
7598 2018-12-16 22:15:18 Their resting state is like a thick gel...they can focus to make themselves More and Less Solid, with the most concentration giving them the density of thick rubber or crystallized amber.
At their least viscous/least dense, they can resemble vegetable oil or corn syrup.
7599 2018-12-16 22:15:07 In fact I’m dreaming

Coconut oil
The scent of your body still lingers on my sheets
7600 2018-12-16 22:14:52 Bless you Heid. It's the nice people like you with always happy positive comments on twitter and lse that Ido it for. Don't stop x
7601 2018-12-16 22:14:50 Secret to good puds is getting the oil real hot & getting plenty of air in your mixture 
7602 2018-12-16 22:14:50 Go check your facts. Beto accepted ZERO $ from Oli and Gas COMPANIES or PACS supported by same. The fact that a large number of INDIVIDUALS work for the oil and gas industry in Texas does not mean he accepted money from industry!
7603 2018-12-16 22:14:47 Like trusting big oil's science on climate change...
7604 2018-12-16 22:14:43 well, hello #Trump2020 
thanks for ignorantly supporting fracking and big oil candidates, right winger.
7605 2018-12-16 22:14:41 When I fry stuff I use my hands to put everything in the oil and always end up dipping my fingers into boiling oil but it’s ok because my food always turns out bomb
7606 2018-12-16 22:14:27 It's okay Mayo. Ho jaayega. Add oil!
7607 2018-12-16 22:14:26 Diesel. Oil. Gunpowder. Sweat. Am I even close?
7608 2018-12-16 22:14:25 Lard & tallow are easiest on my gut. Avacado oil is least troublesome non-animal oil. Most other olive, coconut, butter, etc cause at least mild discomfort for me.
7609 2018-12-16 22:14:16 Try black seed oil
7610 2018-12-16 22:14:13 It's in Maseches Shabbos and it's discussed for less than a page. The focus is clearly more on the oil than on the military victory. It's telling that everything about Hannukah fits into less than 1/156 of Shabbos.
7611 2018-12-16 22:13:47 Lucas Oil Stadium and the surrounding area is such a great environment.  Classy fans.
7612 2018-12-16 22:13:33 The Abandoned Oil Turnabout
7613 2018-12-16 22:13:33 makes you wonder whose responsible for the mass migration of Islam, destruction of our oil energy and all around attack of the Canadian taxpayer doesn’t it!
7614 2018-12-16 22:13:24 It can help if you put ice on the region between your thumb and forefinger. Supposed to numb the nerves attached to that area...also, using lavender essential oil on a cotton ball n smelling it can help relieve the tension
7615 2018-12-16 22:13:03 Make time..buggar the siesta.
7616 2018-12-16 22:13:02 As I am and Carols Daughter products with argan or grape seed oil to seal in the moisture! 
7617 2018-12-16 22:12:39 Anyone know how much it costs to get a piece of art valued? And where is best to go in Wellington? I have an original oil colour by Bernard Aris I’d love info on.
7618 2018-12-16 22:12:35 No more fooling around. Time to get serious...I’m growing out my beard. And I’m gonna take care of it too. I’m talking beard shampoos, conditioners, oil, balms, the works. 2019 is the year I got full lumberjack #NewYearsResolution
7619 2018-12-16 22:12:20 Two kilos of Turkey, Tomato with fresh pepper. Groundnut oil, Maggi etc... One hot cofee. Sleep and think about life
7620 2018-12-16 22:12:09 Know any place I can get good beard oil
7621 2018-12-16 22:12:04 недавно поняла ,что "Лукойл" это может быть сочетание слов "look" и "oil"
тип кто-то такой шёл и резко:"О!Смотри нефть!"
7622 2018-12-16 22:12:00 Dude buddy @JustinTrudeau, I’ve been sitting in traffic for 45 mins now because GP, Alberta’s oil and gas community is having a legit parade on the main road and I’m just tryna go home pls build this GOD DAMN PIPE
7623 2018-12-16 22:11:48 Thanks to those that have criticised me for my suggestion that we stop some overseas aid while we sort out britexit and our homeless problem. oil have not changed my mind but do except we need to help
7624 2018-12-16 22:11:31 I think she’s in need of some butter.  Oil maybe...
7625 2018-12-16 22:11:24 I got to ‘oil’ Just spare me from wannabes 
7626 2018-12-16 22:11:14 I can't stop watching this video.  It says everything we need to know. Donald J Trump is the Best, Number 1 Snake Oil Salesman of all time. And if you still support him. You will get burned, because we all will.
7627 2018-12-16 22:11:13 I may need to try that . I used water, an oil, and a moisturizer. We gone see 
7628 2018-12-16 22:11:09 Don't use olive oil
7629 2018-12-16 22:11:09 y’all  I just peeped the wildest shit and im oil pulling and i can’t say shit out loud and I’m glad I am cause bitch i would’ve SCREAMED
7630 2018-12-16 22:11:05 coconut oil is great as eye-serum, but if you can't use it or don't want to, then I recommend ''berry white'' eye serum from Prreti, it's very good ^_^
7631 2018-12-16 22:10:51 That’s where oil comes from.
7632 2018-12-16 22:10:51 So happy you love the @passport_beauty gemstones! The Amethyst is amazing!  Makes for the best pre bedtime facial oil 
7633 2018-12-16 22:10:49 Of course it has been a huge benefit to Canada.  But that's no reason to excuse it from scrutiny in the here-and-now.  Oil has been a huge benefit to Canada too, but we're sure not shy about looking at it critically now.
7634 2018-12-16 22:10:33 thanks im cured. got some tips to cure my type 1 diabetes? fish oil? green tea? ginger beer? wanna give me your pancreas? you dont need it. stupid ass.
7635 2018-12-16 22:10:26 The shine of the oil rubbed on their muscles only making them stand out further and shine even brighter with the natural sunlight hitting them. The growth continues, the city soon becoming too small for their competition as well. Their growth focusing more on their muscles now.
7636 2018-12-16 22:10:23 Good question!
Since I would be an ‘action‘ figure, I would need a weapon/tool to enhance my power. Since I‘m a mom and quasi-nurse, I would carry a medical bag. Which would contain bandages, ginger, sage, tea tree oil, cinnamon, mint, herbs, cedar, licorice, & other medicines.
7637 2018-12-16 22:10:19 Compare to the reckless, fraudulent, shady subsidy regime in the past.  Where an oil marketer bring in e.g. 5Ltrs but claim he brought in 10Ltrs. Which is not verifiable but FG have to pay them. SO SAD.
7638 2018-12-16 22:10:19 Funny you don't seem to remember the part about those rigs leaving Alberta that seemed to find no shortage of work in the USA? I mean what with the global oil crisis killing the industry and all you'd think they'd just pack them up and store them until the market got better? ymmv
7639 2018-12-16 22:10:18 We subsidise you with our oil so only right you give us some of it back...
7640 2018-12-16 22:10:13 my anxiety is getting bad so i took some cbd oil and it’s calming down but i’m still crazy emotional lol
7641 2018-12-16 22:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this December? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
7642 2018-12-16 22:10:03 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
7643 2018-12-16 22:09:54 Elbow grease... so this is an oil painting. Even more remarkable
7644 2018-12-16 22:09:50 you did see #juncker flick womens hair etc? #protect us!!! you have to be #joking! their courts are #rubbish! & it is not just our #exports it is our #IMPORTS too... no #bmw #mercedes #citroen #peugeot #vw #winecheesebeef #watches #oil #gas etc etc etc - it cuts #both ways!
7645 2018-12-16 22:09:41 My wife started taking,  evening primrose oil,  and now the flashes are few and far between. Good luck with whatever you use. 
7646 2018-12-16 22:09:38 Think US Govt & car manufacturers worldwide should start using technology & build more EVs instead of polluting IC cars. If we take advantage of latest advances we don't need no stinkin' IC cars & the Govt must stop supporting & propping up Big Oil. That dog don't hunt anymore.
7647 2018-12-16 22:09:36 C-P-C has cut gasoline and diesel prices by 0.1 N-T per liter from this morning following a slight decline in international crude oil prices last week.
7648 2018-12-16 22:09:34 Oil & Vinegar criminal
7649 2018-12-16 22:09:27 A nigga just offered to pay for my oil change.... I see now why y'all be using these niggas 
7650 2018-12-16 22:09:16 Saudis will come and spend the money like its the end other world. Considering they hate Qatarians this will be a war of oil and money
7651 2018-12-16 22:09:10 Great interview! Keep pushing the Canadian Government(Trudeau) to build PIPELINES and buy Alberta oil rather than OPEC oil!!! It’s all about Jobs and Independence!!
7652 2018-12-16 22:09:07 Wtf is that oil slick on the front of his hairline? 
7653 2018-12-16 22:09:06 TDDとブクロハマはパルシィにも掲載予定だけどいつから掲載されるんだ
7654 2018-12-16 22:09:05 the loony left would blame that on the oil sands too!
7655 2018-12-16 22:09:05 Energy east
The plan to export oil more costly than the one we import,so its been declared non profitable by the company who would run it
The alibi for not raising taxes in Alberta
And the ever living Québec bashing argument( with péréquation)
Wish Trudeau had bought hydro lines
7656 2018-12-16 22:09:01 No recipe! Just whip your ricotta with lemon zest, olive oil, and honey. Then add in whatever feels right!
7657 2018-12-16 22:09:01 lisa's mom's homemade oil & vinegar dressing adulterer. I win.
7658 2018-12-16 22:08:56 Presido i greet you sir.
7659 2018-12-16 22:08:52 send mmm over...i tell you...I would like to see these photos.
Heron and Tigger please. 
7660 2018-12-16 22:08:21 パルシィくんははやく掲載して
7661 2018-12-16 22:08:14 What are some questions you may have about CBD oil? We'd love to help!
7662 2018-12-16 22:08:12 Gen 2 oil patch sounds so entitled
7663 2018-12-16 22:07:39 Quick update. Got that body shop matte foundation I'm loving it. For the first time in a while I did not have to deal with my glasses sliding on my face due to excessive oil.

I'm in love. Thank you so much 
7664 2018-12-16 22:07:38 これから二次創作するとき※これは公式の設定を無視して描いています って注意書きかかなきゃ
7665 2018-12-16 22:07:37 i should not have to wait 3 hours for a damn oil change 
7666 2018-12-16 22:07:37 Why is my oil change like $140?. I’m about to just not drive lmao
7667 2018-12-16 22:07:33 1. 46
2. Scotland
3. Clear some debts probably the first thing I'd do, then if I have any left buy a CBD vaping kit or some real oil to help me sleep, and recover from exercise
7668 2018-12-16 22:07:32 I was meant to be both a grumpy old lighthouse operator in massachusetts and a snake oil salesman in the american southwest but something went wrong and now I just play minecraft in a kansas basement
7669 2018-12-16 22:07:17 Hey here’s an oil change beb
7670 2018-12-16 22:07:14 You mean omega 3 the fish oil?
7671 2018-12-16 22:07:11 End these endless Oil wars 
Start with renewable energy and work for these soldiers to come home. Boys get sick missing a
and worrying about their dads.
7672 2018-12-16 22:07:08 Amazing what you can become with oil money
7673 2018-12-16 22:06:46 The KRPC was built purposely to handle heavy & extra heavy crude oil, mostly from Venezuela , & then it was meant to feed northern end users of the product. You can learn more on why it was built rather than clinging on this old narrative.
7674 2018-12-16 22:06:38 They should also be screaming at OPEC & US oil companies fracking in US. For people dependent on a commodity they should know more about how their industry works. People in agriculture know how their industry works.
7675 2018-12-16 22:06:33 That is better than a win for you?
7676 2018-12-16 22:06:20 Only if he can run around an oil rig with a shotgun
7677 2018-12-16 22:06:16 Oil off our land =- $$ from the receiver into our treasury. Get it done!
7678 2018-12-16 22:06:14 And the oil and the gas in the surrounding sea.
7679 2018-12-16 22:06:10 おもったけど毎月3誌買うの、一端の学生であるわたしにはキツいな…
7680 2018-12-16 22:06:06 Olive oil and balsamic no grandkids-? I think I broke the joke, sorry.
7681 2018-12-16 22:06:01 But to the original question. Alberta leaving and most likely joining the USA would benefit Alberta’s oil and gas sector. Canada on the other hand would suffer from a very weak dollar and investor confidence would plunge, and our debt to gdp would climb well past the crisis level
7682 2018-12-16 22:05:56 Canadian oil is already meeting all of ON’s refinery needs and a good chunk of QC’s.
7683 2018-12-16 22:05:51 Not until the Oil drys up
7684 2018-12-16 22:05:39 That was totally different. These facts are incontrovertible.
1) She was a Clinton
2) She was a Democrat
3) She was much too knowledgeable for a woman.
4) She was a secretary of state who didn't run an oil company.
5) Her cookies sucked.
6) That hair.
7) She was a Clinton.
7685 2018-12-16 22:05:31 What started out as a nice little tromp through the sewers for the thieves guild concerning Kobolds & troglodytes for the Fail Squad crew turned into....
Filling a modified bag of holding with 15 gallons of oil, tossing it and igniting the oil ...
7686 2018-12-16 22:05:31 Oil and vinegar not an engineer.
7687 2018-12-16 22:05:30 Lol a man say a cooking oil 
7688 2018-12-16 22:05:23 Some coal or oil lobbyist
7689 2018-12-16 22:05:18 In light of recent events there's a good argument to be made that the central Bolivarian project of restructuring the PDVSA and diverting oil revenues to social spending was a grave error.
7690 2018-12-16 22:05:18 Oil 
7691 2018-12-16 22:05:09 Shower, lavender body oil, candles, quiet music, your favorite perfume .. then sleeeeep
7692 2018-12-16 22:05:08 Oh, and good luck with the cancer linked to oil sands pollution, as well as when the Saudis/OPEC/the US decide to cause prices to tank again.

You're right, I totally envy you and those who work in your industry.
7693 2018-12-16 22:05:06 Sometimes palm oil is the lubricant we need.
7694 2018-12-16 22:05:00 Judging by you lot that character is snake oil salesmen, happy to meet the gullible everywhere - although you may find there’s not so many can’t see through your empty rhetoric as you think. Mind, we also need ‘stuff’ to trade. That’s ours. That doesn’t rely on imports from EU.
7695 2018-12-16 22:04:45 サマが思い描いてた通りのシスコンでニコニコ
7696 2018-12-16 22:04:34 48, Connecticut, buy Xmas gifts, pay off some bills!!! And take my mom out for a nice dinner... get an oil and transmission fluid change! Thanks for asking, how about yourself? Not the money part of the question! Lol
7697 2018-12-16 22:04:25 Ryan Zinke has pursued Trump’s agenda to promote oil drilling and coal mining by expanding federal leasing, cutting royalty rates, and easing land protections.
7698 2018-12-16 22:04:19 My father stays forcing me to write birthday cards in the year of 2018. I wrote a card but accidentally put the envelope on a surface where I spilled oil and he wants to roll his eyes at me for it. Dude take your damn cards and shove 'm up your ass
7699 2018-12-16 22:04:17 Valerian root is a natural alternative than can help induce sleep. CBD oil is also good for sleep and will help reduce stress.
7700 2018-12-16 22:04:02 As a woodworker and a writer I recommend first sanding it at a fine grit, so first at 220 and finishing above 400. There are lots of water white finishes but realistically any finish is going to change the appearance, especially oil based ones. Most woodworkers will tell you that
7701 2018-12-16 22:03:53 @francoislegault you rather support your own than the arabs. Arab oil isn’t dirty? It’s blood oil. If you want it for your people, that’s your choice. But you should let it pass so others can benefit. You can stay in your bubble. Foolish guy
7702 2018-12-16 22:03:33 Worked in Scotland for 5 years, Id happily vote them out of the union. The SNPs plan would of been great when the oil price tanked. Those who vote for SNP are a bunch of NEDs.
7703 2018-12-16 22:03:32 i use coconut oil to help the dry skin around my eyes, apply it twice a day or so and it should help
7704 2018-12-16 22:03:12 So what VP oshinbajo, “said is can’t remove subsidy now or fuel may go as high as N220/

The covers for the difference in the cost of import by NNPC. That is subsidy in place! 

This subsidy is strictly between NNPC & FG, No oil market is involved. 

That's the difference.
7705 2018-12-16 22:03:06 Nobody ever said it was easy to establish priorities, eh? #JustinTrudeau #ableg #cdnpoli #bcpoli #oil @oilsands #EnergyEast #Alberta #pipelines @HuffPostCanada
7706 2018-12-16 22:03:02 TRUDEAU HAS SHARE IN THE SAUDI OIL FIELD THA,S WHY HE IS NOT IN A HURRY.
7707 2018-12-16 22:02:47 3-1 Oil Kings after the 2nd.
7708 2018-12-16 22:02:43 Oil money go change things
7709 2018-12-16 22:02:38 I’m not naming any names here but I once had a dream one of my friends took out a bottle of olive oil and mistook it for water but drank it anyway
7710 2018-12-16 22:02:36 That second half doesn't make sense, fracking isn't pro UAE, it's in competition with them.  Fracking acts as a price cap on oil, and if it fails tar sands are the backstop.
7711 2018-12-16 22:02:32 China is sponsoring terrorist groups in Middle East same as Russia is to establish & protect their stake in Middle East oil. China & Iran are closely knit as #huawei case of #megwanzhou showed us
7712 2018-12-16 22:02:21 True - but the complaints have no basis without the heavy oil bit ...
7713 2018-12-16 22:01:53 So I might get to see your willy? 
Send 'em over pronto !!!!
7714 2018-12-16 22:01:34 I will take out my flat twist just to grease/oil my scalp and put them right back 
7715 2018-12-16 22:01:31 Okay friends, I'm in need of an essential oil diffuser. Ideas welcome. — looking for recommendations
7716 2018-12-16 22:01:29 20; Michigan, get some CBD oil / pay off student loans
7717 2018-12-16 22:01:28 今週もゆる～くいきましょ
7718 2018-12-16 22:01:22 Except when we have no pipelines to export with, in which case there is a national priority to displace oil imports and become at least Energy independent.  This is not a normal situation.  Econ 101 balance of trade logic doesn’t apply.
7719 2018-12-16 22:01:10 if we had the pipeline to Irving oil in New Brunswick we would not need the Arabic oil ..Use the army to install  THE PIPELINE  it if we have too.
7720 2018-12-16 22:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however a terrorism crisis.
7721 2018-12-16 22:00:46 I assume I'm safe to decide this now:
1. Low- Double Negative
2. Earl Sweatshirt- Some Rap Songs
3. SOPHIE- Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides
4.Yves Tumor- Safe in the Hands of Love
5. Palm- Rock Island

Not gonna lie, I love how stuttering and gritty music got this year.
7722 2018-12-16 22:00:44 The largest amount of lobbyist money comes from big oil, big pharma & the NRA. The majority of the money goes to Republicans. Think about it!!!! We need a law keeping all lobbyists at least 300 yards away from any government building.
7723 2018-12-16 22:00:44 1 multi-vitamin, 1 fish oil, 1 vitamin d per day

7725 2018-12-16 22:00:40 @iamspecialized any idea how long before the Gloss Oil Slick/Mint Epic size XL will be available again?

7728 2018-12-16 22:00:25 Is it worth noting that @NicolaSturgeon 's defence of the 2013 White Paper has largely been ridiculed and laughed at for the overly optimistic scenarios on finances and oil and ignoring everything that can go wrong? And it has gone very wrong.
7729 2018-12-16 22:00:21 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7730 2018-12-16 22:00:20 December 16, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7731 2018-12-16 22:00:11 So Trevor once again is so myopic that he totally misses the point.

WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF QC DOESN'T WANT TO USE OUR OIL, WE SIMPLY WANT TO TRANSPORT IT TO SAINT JOHN NB.

So that we can export it & maybe even replace the Irving Refinery imports. Which do include Saudi oil.
7732 2018-12-16 21:59:58 I laughed, then coughed until I passed out and hit my head because I inhale toxic amounts of oil and coal fumes every time I go outside
7733 2018-12-16 21:59:47 Clinton's are classic snake oil salesmen, had me fooled for quite awhile, problem....many still fooled by both of them.......
7734 2018-12-16 21:59:40 You reek of tanning oil, desperation, and panic. It’s quite pungent.
7735 2018-12-16 21:59:40 Nuttal is amazing in his own way. More bearish it gets it the more bullish he becomes. The guy has been aching for crazy oil prices since as long as I can remember. Doesn't even flinch when his past picks come up. Balls of steel lol
7736 2018-12-16 21:59:19 you are so kind--I will send pics of me on my horses!! In my tight riding breeches!!!!!
7737 2018-12-16 21:59:14 .@JustinTrudeau please explain the glaring double standard with respect to oil tankers?  I am waiting with bated breath.
7738 2018-12-16 21:59:08 Let's not push that.  Trudeau WANTS a separatist movement in Alberta (and Quebec).  His stupid immigration and oil policies are intentional.  The Liberals won the 90's because of the Reform movement; and Chretien antigonized it.  Liberals want the same again.
7739 2018-12-16 21:59:02 メイトで漫画の予約してないんだけど先着順なんでしょ…今日買いに行ったとき予約だけで部数終了とかしてたら泣くわ
7740 2018-12-16 21:58:49 Never knew about that. Glad I’ve never tried topical steroids. I have eczema but I use Shea butter and coconut oil to alleviate any spots. Since you posted this, I won’t be using steroids.
7741 2018-12-16 21:58:33 I’m getting my oil changed and I heard one of the mechanics say “well that’s not good”  nice

7745 2018-12-16 21:58:26 I just don’t see the logic when Rolls Royce, etc, moving out of UK because of Brexit, you’d close the border to the country that exports 40% of UK’s food & drink, will have majority of oil & 40% of the gas - you hit English & Scots businesses with more charges. Not surprising tho
7746 2018-12-16 21:58:11 Loved the video as usual! Regarding your eye issues- Make sure you’ve changed all your air filters in your offices and at home. Put some argan oil around your eyes day and night. Trust me this will help you, I live in Cali too.
7747 2018-12-16 21:57:53 When it was all cut up, cooked for about 15 minutes. Then blended and simmered for 25 more. Tomatoes, onions, garlic, habaneros, apple cider vinegar salt & oil.
7748 2018-12-16 21:57:47 He is obsessed with oil and gas and having as much as he can.
7749 2018-12-16 21:57:44 Okay so I have extremely, unflattering oily skin & I used @UrbanDecay de-slick oil control primer last night. Got home late & was too lazy to take off my makeup & my skin is STILL NOT oily and makeup still in place  a true BLESSING 
7750 2018-12-16 21:57:41 One day I’ll go visit the Lucas Oil Stadium.
7751 2018-12-16 21:57:29 Want to shut down oil production, here are a few products produced from petroleum: heart valves, dashboards, roofing, water pipes, eyeglasses, CD's & DVD's, telephones, cameras, parachutes, dentures, fan belts, golf balls, movie film, paint, refrigerant.
7752 2018-12-16 21:57:23 I use very high quality butter like Kerry Gold. Coconut and olive oil are my other two favorite infusions. You can literally make most anything into a healthy edible 
Do yourself a huge favor and get a magical butter machine. I have the MB2 and it makes life so much easier.
7753 2018-12-16 21:57:23 Omg I love olive oil

7757 2018-12-16 21:57:10 Disagree as much as you like. Alberta became a province under Canadian law.The land that the oil is on is owned by the crown. Federal land .All Canadians have a stake in Alberta.
7758 2018-12-16 21:57:05 In history, the Chinese praised mints for their tranquillizing properties while the Greeks and Romans added mint to milk to prevent spoilage and served the herb after meals as a digestive aid. Peppermint essential oil is known to give a cooling, awakening and refreshing feeling.
7759 2018-12-16 21:56:53 Coconut oil I get from Aldi’s. Drive next town over to get. Coconut butter I either order from Tropical Traditions or get the manna from Amazon bogo. Depends on sale. I like most bang for my buck.
7760 2018-12-16 21:56:29 Pipelines & Oil,Canada’s lifeline,safest & most efficient method of transporting OIL.
7761 2018-12-16 21:56:28 my skincare routine is rosehip oil crying off your makeup then rosehip oil again
7762 2018-12-16 21:56:27 Rapeseed oil. Higher burn and higher smoke temp. 
7763 2018-12-16 21:56:25 Oil and water don’t mix.
7764 2018-12-16 21:56:09 No offense but every time I bite into a Krispy Kreme doughnut it’s like I just bit into some oil... y’all gas it way too much. But yum yum go crazyyy  #letsargue #doughnuts
7765 2018-12-16 21:56:06 Yes. In the two cases, you have more money chasing fewer goods. The ratio M/Y goes up (M=money supply; Y=total output). But be careful: it's not only the potential "supply" of oil that increased; the whole PPF shifted. (Good question.)
7766 2018-12-16 21:55:58 You missed the point. It is about Alberta oil replacing imported oil in Eastern Canada at great benefit to this country’s balance of trade and internal economy.
7767 2018-12-16 21:55:55 Whoever invented Olbas oil, I salute you, I owe you a pint or a vino. 
7768 2018-12-16 21:55:43 The oil pit I throw you guys into, on day one may cause gays. Suzi and I are not sure?
7769 2018-12-16 21:55:41 Allah kiyaye
7770 2018-12-16 21:55:40 I’ve acknowledged that. Our beliefs are slightly different and that’s cool. I appreciate the conversation. Oil companies are running scams too. I would just like a change.
7771 2018-12-16 21:55:17 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.

7773 2018-12-16 21:55:14 Exactly! They refused us entry & didn’t let us join until N.Sea oil & gas were found and have been systematically asset stripping us of it ever since.

7776 2018-12-16 21:54:28 Well of course John. Anything for you John. Neocons have to salvage something... mostly oil for #HAL
7777 2018-12-16 21:54:27 Have people been sniffing oil instead of burning it?

7779 2018-12-16 21:54:21 Thank you. Do you use ghee, real butter like Kerry Gold Irish, or Coconut oil. I’ve heard coconut is a nice carrier oil. Thank you very much for answering. Love sent to you.

7782 2018-12-16 21:54:03 Massively export oil & gas worldwide at top price with export surtax. Cut consumption at home through measures, education amd contact reporting. use surtax proceeds to build world class renewable tech. for transportation, home heating, mfg energy, and then export that technology
7783 2018-12-16 21:54:03 Oil price is likely to average $60-$65/barrel in 2019, and is unlikely to exceed $80/barrel, Indosuez Wealth Management, the global wealth management arm of Crédit Agricole group.
7784 2018-12-16 21:53:58 My boobs have been destroyed since like 20 weeks but I went up a cup size already. I have a total of 5 stretch marks and they’re on my hips, they kinda have popped up one at a time. I just use bio oil but since that ran out it’s been vit E oil & black caster oil on my belly!
7785 2018-12-16 21:53:57 If use have coconut oil, witch hazel, or petroleum jelly try one; they’ll help a lot!
7786 2018-12-16 21:53:36 The purchase of the Olive Oil is currently for me to see how well I go with it. The 1L bottle (no virgins were killed during the making of it) was cheap enough for a test over the next month or so. Then, I will reevaluate. #food
7787 2018-12-16 21:53:27 I am reading the best one now. Now please let me carry on...The Horse of The Year show is calling.

7789 2018-12-16 21:53:22 By all means, here, use this oil too, it can have some swell effects ;)
7790 2018-12-16 21:53:22 Hahahah that's much better than olive oil atheist
7791 2018-12-16 21:53:21 I think @NickCohen4 is reaching his personal jumping-the-shark moment like Chris Hitchens did; you remember, when he suddenly became convinced that the Iraq oil invasion was a good and worthy cause and cheap con-man Ahmed Chalabi was the saviour of Iraq..
7792 2018-12-16 21:53:12 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
7793 2018-12-16 21:53:09 With dramatic cuts needed, climate scientist James Rewnwick @CubaRaglanGuy says lack of tangible action is bad news. National leader Bridges @simonjbridges commits to bring back oil and gas drilling. #ReallySimon ?!
7794 2018-12-16 21:53:04 I thought about that, but I prefer to carry jugs of such as oil or vinegar upright. Also, they tend not to be as collapsible.
7795 2018-12-16 21:53:01 Yeah critical of our oil but don’t mind having their hand out for transfer payments!!! Despicable!!
Two faced!!
7796 2018-12-16 21:52:55 All the States (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Ondo, Cross River, Imo, Edo &amp; Abia) in the Niger Delta in Nigeria have crude oil reserves
7797 2018-12-16 21:52:40 Heat pan, add oil, put salmon fillets flesh side down for one minute, flip over and cook skin side down covered for 8-9 minutes.
7798 2018-12-16 21:52:35 I thought one has to have traces of beard to even start using beard oil? 
7799 2018-12-16 21:52:24 I almost feel sorry for the thousands of #DallasCowboys fans that flooded Lucas Oil Stadium to see their team get shut out. #colts
7800 2018-12-16 21:52:11 @DavidLBunch David, please get SHELL out of OIL & GAS & into ELECTRIC , HYDROGEN and all non-emitting industries as fast as possible please
7801 2018-12-16 21:52:00 In Texas, oil and natural gas production is not only fueling jobs and the economy, but is also a significant contributor to the state’s education system.

7805 2018-12-16 21:51:33 because GANDu @BJP4India and SUTIYA @narendramodi are living in FOOL's paradise.
7806 2018-12-16 21:51:19 Okay. 

Help me understand how the numbers in that article make sense: 

“U.S. crude oil production – 11.7 million BPD”
+
“U.S. crude oil imports – 7.2 million BPD” 
= 18.9m BPD available 

Yet 
“U.S. petroleum consumption – 20.5 million BPD”

How is there a deficit of 1.6m?!
7807 2018-12-16 21:51:11 I've commented on that more than once & used the analogy:

If you neglect maintenance on your vehicle for ten years you've saved five grand in oil changes & the like, but will eventually spend ten grand or more replacing a tranny and blown engine.

That's "Ralph Klein" thinking
7808 2018-12-16 21:50:39 Y’all I thought I had a stomach virus...I did not. Just too much MCT oil. Imma send this right back to hell, where it apparently came from #keto #mctoil

7811 2018-12-16 21:50:15 I bet that's some good ass motor oil though.
7812 2018-12-16 21:49:59 There was a kid in school who did that and it smelled so bad! He claimed getting the oil and dirt trapped in the twists was how they form. He chopped them off not too long after starting. His mom probably yelled at him lol.
7813 2018-12-16 21:49:55 Standing prime rib
Generally I plan for 1/2 of a pound per person.
Roast should be at room temperature.
Rub the roast with mild olive oil,salt and pepper 
Put roast in an oven pre heated to 500 degrees. 
Leave oven on for 30 minutes.
7814 2018-12-16 21:49:34 @jackmintz imagine if Canadian oil met the eastern Canadian refinery demand and the excess was shipped out.
7815 2018-12-16 21:49:26 The way Manchester United is going down, they will soon discover oil..
7816 2018-12-16 21:49:26 Incorrect they are no more zoo animals left; for the last year, now they are eating cats, dogs and rats. 

The basic food that everyone can count on eating if you have the means is pasta in oil or tomato sauce.
7817 2018-12-16 21:49:16 This looks great. I will have to do this too. I drizzled Croatian Olive oil on my porridge. What a delicious treat.

7820 2018-12-16 21:48:52 WTF
7821 2018-12-16 21:48:49 Whilst I have used Olive Oil for cooking in the past, a lot of Keto advocates recommend using it as an extra source of fat and flavour to stuff like salads. Other diets also include Olive Oil for a similar purpose, such as the Mediterranean Diet. #food
7822 2018-12-16 21:48:48 "pipelines blocked by socialists charading as enviros" is a stupid dishonest thing to say. You do not understand that people prefer not to risk having oil poisoning their homes and parks? Why don't you get this?
7823 2018-12-16 21:48:32 The oil industry was warned over a year ago by their own analysts that over production was driving the price of Alberta oil downward as the oil inventory glut grew. When global prices fall, you don’t make up your earnings by over producing more.
7824 2018-12-16 21:48:31 Good to know. I also use corn starch or baby powder on oil stains, it absorbs too
7825 2018-12-16 21:48:30 anybody wanna pay to get my oil changed cause my moma trippin
7826 2018-12-16 21:48:26 Do you know that one dollar is now 360 naira?  Not everyone here is a fool. Do you also know oil price was at its lowest within this period. Do you know for the first time Nigeria export more than import.
7827 2018-12-16 21:48:03 Alright. The indica oil @nslc is pretty good. The prices are  highway  fukkin robbery. No way  people  will  keep  paying these prices.
7828 2018-12-16 21:48:01 Two baths. Second one with dish soap to get the oil‘s off his coat. And the extra smell.

7832 2018-12-16 21:47:08 Changing the oil has to be the easiest thing I hate doing. 
7833 2018-12-16 21:47:04 Right, they’re preparing for when China crashes the US dollar. But first, the Middle East must accept bitcoin for oil.

7837 2018-12-16 21:46:51 OMG wow, you’re amazing! You’re clearly the smartest person in the whole wide world, that’s why you’re following lies paid for by oil barons and spending your time arguing on Twitter.
7838 2018-12-16 21:46:42 Fish have like, a spine and that's it, easy to tell if it's de-boned.
Frying pan on medium high heat, olive oil in the pan.
Make sure the fish is dry and salt+pepper one side, lay that side down in the pan, salt+pepper the other side, cook 2-4 minutes and flip, cook 2-4 min again
7839 2018-12-16 21:46:40 Bitumen is a byproduct of crude oil. You refine the crude oil into different grades, the heavy products sink and the light ones float. You know those black paths you drive down every day? Bitumen is the binder for that asphalt. Educate yourself before spouting off on twitter.
7840 2018-12-16 21:46:32 ~3% of oil is used in chemical synthesis. But single-use plastics need to be reduced. So the oil industry, the largest, wealthiest, most powerful industry in history, must shrink by ~98% by 2050 at the latest, ideally 2030.

Many will fight the physics to the death.

Sucks for farmers but it’s in the same capacity as oil and fossil fuels. Economies change. Gotta grow with it.

7853 2018-12-16 21:45:32 I keep hearing the narrative of how Quebec loves the Saudi oil but doesn't want Alberta oil yet here we have proof that is a lie. If you want to blame the Irving family for being capitalists then yeah, go ahead.
7854 2018-12-16 21:45:32 Trudeau and Freeland both condemned SA, for human rights abuses.

Trudeau and Freeland support selling SA military equipment to commit more human rights abuses. 

Trudeau and Freeland still support importing SA oil

Yes Canada is afraid of SA and have no allies to support them
7855 2018-12-16 21:45:29 Yesterday, I decided to purchase a few new grocery items. The first is chilli flakes and the other is Olive Oil. The Chilli flakes are for increasing resting BMR and extra flavour. The Olive Oil is for adding to salads. #food

7859 2018-12-16 21:45:11 it tastes bad, and its just about the most unhealthy thing people put in their bodies, its about 30% palm oil, which if you didn't know is absolutely awful for you and the environment

7863 2018-12-16 21:44:58 Maybe! You’d think that just a nice olive oil and some vinegar would have been enough for these monsters
7864 2018-12-16 21:44:41 Asha- Did someone anoint your feet with Precious Oil today? If not, I apologize on behalf of all men.
7865 2018-12-16 21:44:35 I'm so glad I planned ahead and brought my little fan. You just put nice smelling oil on a cotton wool disc and pop it in the fan and it fixes bad smells. So easy.
7866 2018-12-16 21:44:22 TRADERS OF CRUDE OIL believe that in 2019 WTI crude oil will bounce between $46 and 82 per barrel.

okay
7867 2018-12-16 21:44:20 This is a mining site. Only 3% of the oil sands is mineable. How about looking at a SAGD site instead? Also, yes Canada has the highest environmental standards in the world, and this will be fully reclaimed to its original state. Dont let facts get in the way of your belief tho.
7868 2018-12-16 21:44:16 Recent figures from FIRS AND NCS are encouraging. D oil sector still remains our major source of revenue , low production and price are not helping matters.
7869 2018-12-16 21:44:12 Help me understand how the numbers in that article make sense: 

“U.S. crude oil production – 11.7 million BPD”
+
“U.S. crude oil imports – 7.2 million BPD” 
= 18.9m BPD available 

Yet 
“U.S. petroleum consumption – 20.5 million BPD”

How is there a deficit of 1.6m?!
7870 2018-12-16 21:44:00 Dandruff? Lemongrass oil may offer relief for your scalp. Dandruff is due to a type of yeast & lemongrass oil may have antifungal effects that fend it off. If you experience acne, dandruff or another skin condition. 1st try a small amount to see your bodies reactions.

7874 2018-12-16 21:43:20 Dinner was yum, think the tuna steak was so much better than I expected. Lightly pan seared with olive oil, sea salt, black pepper and smoked paprika. Popped it in the oven with minced garlic and chopped tomatoes. Heaven!
7875 2018-12-16 21:42:43 Christopher Watts story blew my mind, killing pregnant wife is enough but then strangling your two daughters and then stuffing them through an 8” hole oil tank is whole nother level shit Jesus

7881 2018-12-16 21:42:18 Different topic... Since I have to replace my bong and my oil rig, do y'all have any suggestions for an oil piece. Banger or nail? E-nail? Actually @ganjajon, guide my hand in this.
7882 2018-12-16 21:42:17 Just reaffirms the point. Religion is the route of most problems in this world. Closely followed by oil.
7883 2018-12-16 21:42:14 omg i hope you’re okay!  i recommend tons of eye drops and a nap after.
i did fresh banana pepper oil in the eye once.
7884 2018-12-16 21:42:08 My country used to be the same way. We were a social democracy. A drop in oil prices  in the 80s made it necessary to implement austerity measures. Those created social upheaval out of which emerged Chavez, the democratic socialist who promised to make it rain milk and honey.
7885 2018-12-16 21:41:56 ...New Donna Brazile just arrived at Walter Reed Medical Center of Oil
7886 2018-12-16 21:41:41 What's the point of vinegar when you had olive oil and soy sauce @Kapot333 ? (yes I'm very against vinegar use)
7887 2018-12-16 21:41:29 Do the US sell our own oil back to us at a discount? Not likely
7888 2018-12-16 21:41:18 I try to make it enjoyable by adding broccoli, eggs, and sesame oil  it's not something i wanna eat all the time but when I dont know what to eat sometimes it really does taste great. But that's just me
7889 2018-12-16 21:40:57 I hope @AndrewScheer will 
1)cancel carbon tax
2)withdrawal from UN Paris accord. 3)Get pipelines built
4)Stop importing dirty oil
5))fix our wastewater plants, don’t pump  into waterways
6)upgrade recycling 
7)withdrawal from UN migration-population affects emissions most

7891 2018-12-16 21:40:37 Just wait for electric cars to be more widespread... Crude Oil extraction will no longer be profitable and Iran will be on her knees
7892 2018-12-16 21:40:36 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
7893 2018-12-16 21:40:36 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7896 2018-12-16 21:40:25 Not like those oil-by-rail risks, right? Speak to the surviving citizens of Lac-Megantic about your concerns for the B.C. Orca population.
7897 2018-12-16 21:40:24 CIA intervention in foreign countries and supporting coups to undermine a competitor in the global oil trade will usually get that result if history has proven anything.
7898 2018-12-16 21:40:21 Pues nada. A joderse toca. A gastar más gas oil, tiempo etc. Es lo q tiene vivir en guirilandia. Luego saldrá su Ilustrísima diciendo q no entiende por q la gente no les vota

7900 2018-12-16 21:40:11 AVOCADO AND HONEY FACE MASK   

1. 1/2 of an avocado mashed
2. 2 tbs honey
3. 1/2 teaspoon coconut oil 

Mix the avocado with the honey and add in the coconut oil. Leave the mask on for 15 minutes and wash it off afterwards.

7903 2018-12-16 21:40:00 Hey Gerry - it's about getting Alberta oil ACROSS Quebec to tidewater...not TO Quebec.  Seriously...where have you been?
7904 2018-12-16 21:39:48 No! Have you heard of the tsunami in 2012 in Japan the nuclear plants are still pouring nuclear waste into their oceans, which have already shown in CA. Gulf oil spill, etc. Not to mention they feel pain.
7905 2018-12-16 21:39:40 @Lucas_Oil does your 75-140 synthetic gear oil need the friction additive that's required for limited slip rear end in a 3.73 gears 11 mustang GT supercharged?
7906 2018-12-16 21:39:36 Someone really needs to check his oil. Seems a bit low. 

Paging @ninaandtito
7907 2018-12-16 21:39:33 Why didn't you make the PM actually answer your question about Quebec blocking Energy East while apparently happily using Saudi Oil. Why does no journalist want to press him on that point? I would really like to know the answer from a bipartisan standpoint!
7908 2018-12-16 21:39:33 Yeah, but for one, that doesn’t just apply to the US. 

Same as we’re exporting some crude that’s not well matched to our refineries, that crude oil will be better matched with a foreign refinery that will use it for fuel production.

We’re still exporting *more* crude.  Correct?
7909 2018-12-16 21:39:31 Fox News Anchors know that when Mr. Drumpf starts whining, Paul Ryan silently writes a song about #love

7912 2018-12-16 21:39:22 All the "we hate all those Canadians in our Alberta" ppl were saying Quebec gets all it's oil from Saudi Arabia. Than when shown otherwise they keep saying it, or say Quebec should get even less.

Donald Trump logic. Keep saying you have a large penis until you believe.
7913 2018-12-16 21:39:13 Every single thing we use petro oil 4 can be better replaced by things that aren’t the poison responsible 4 destroying a livable climate. The arrogant ignorance of fossil fuel pimps is only exceeded by their historic greed & the surgical ethics bypass procedure they all received.
7914 2018-12-16 21:39:10 kitty litter/ fat absorber in the sun followed by degreaser left to sit for a little while then rinse thoroughly. may have to repeat a few times but eventually it gets it all, I followed mine with timber oil because it looked a bit dry.
7915 2018-12-16 21:38:59 I never said an oil transportation infrastructure deficit wasn't a problem. it is. It's just a much smaller problem relative to the global supply, demand and price issue.
7916 2018-12-16 21:38:55 Yes!! Mine was sooo bad puss was coming out of it i had even considered taking it out. But i would put the oil day and night and it helped it so much it’s completely gone
7917 2018-12-16 21:38:55 I’ve learned a lot of technology is withheld for monetary purposes like the electric car for instance which was made in the 1870’s but are just now hitting the market comfortably due to them harming oil and metal companies

7925 2018-12-16 21:38:15 I watched the first 20mins of the first one, and binned it off. 
What gets me with the repeat thing, esp on the BBC is, if we wanted repeats, we can watch them free elsewhere, why do we have to fork out an exorbitant licence fee to keep Gary Lineker in beard oil?!
7926 2018-12-16 21:38:14 Vetiver is a very pungent oil. One drop added a lot of depth to this rosemary/lemon combo

7927 2018-12-16 21:38:12 Someone who clearly won gold at the Onion Olympic infiltrated our entire apartment this evening with their cooking. I brought my aroma fan and lavender oil from home and mostly vanquished it but the smell in my toilet could be improved with a bout of diarrhoea, to be honest.

7931 2018-12-16 21:37:55 So let me know how I can “shop” for that liver transplant or knee replacement. If totally free market, few people could truly pay the cost of their health care. We are not talking about oil changes which the free market is addressing quite well. This is different.

7938 2018-12-16 21:37:15 They forgot to add cream that list. My preferred fats are saturated beef, pork, chicken, cream, butter, coconut oil and zero corn, soybean, and other rancid vegetable oils
7939 2018-12-16 21:37:07 They had apparently done a VT for @BBCBreakfast where Billy said what he was able to say in the end. Lineker's pissed off the #TMS @Aggerscricket crowd already this weekend.. Piss off the #BTCC crowd... horse's head in his bed in the morning (or BMR engine leaking oil..)

7957 2018-12-16 21:35:39 My point being that irving imports saudi oil, refines it, then sends to all eastern provinces, including qc. To claim qc doesn’t import saudi oil is a weak argument. They suck up that refined saudi oil like a fat kid with a Slurpee.

  1 3/4  tbsp of  Black Pepper 

 Marinate  Pork in 1/2 cup Olive Oil and  Black Pepper for 1 hour.

7979 2018-12-16 21:33:14 Do you honestly feel that man is not the primary cause of climate change due to industrialization by the overuse of fossil fuels such as coal and oil? Seriously?
7980 2018-12-16 21:33:12 Syrian oil fields aren't worth fighting over for major powers. Even the regime doesn't always bother fighting over them, instead buying oil from ISIS after ISIS took them over.

7986 2018-12-16 21:32:34 I don’t see this as cherry-picking or implying anything, it’s a graph that shows that Quebec is using more Cdn oil that it has in the past.
7987 2018-12-16 21:32:29 Careful what you advocate .@DVATW because rUK may well end up being importing  gas, oil, electricity, water, food etc from independent Scotland.
7988 2018-12-16 21:32:13 More than when he was in office, you mean? More than his fake, illegal Iraq oil invasion?
7989 2018-12-16 21:32:11 Exporting #cdn heavy oil to China massively offsets methylmercury, GG, etc from burning coal & was poorly messaged.
Assuming consultations are a success, pipeline utility may be the same field of dreams as Peak Oil's threat demanded we build the oil sands

8002 2018-12-16 21:30:26 Yes! And we hypocrites here lecture the West while we put in production THE biggest GES contributor of the country. Mcinnis cementery. We lecture on oil while receiving equalization pay in the other hand & polluting. @francoislegault , you insulted the West, refuse equalization!
8003 2018-12-16 21:30:26 Beside our insurance they're taking away our EPA, Consumer protection, National parks, Oil drilling safety, affordable housing, and our reputation around the world. They are also picking our pockets clean including the lint.

8011 2018-12-16 21:29:42 which is still 50%. the majority of Canadian oil is going through the US as well and is a secondary market situation to refinersin QUE. what this indicates is it's better for Canadians to look at increased US market access for secondary sales then direct Canadian shipment.

8028 2018-12-16 21:27:13 Kirsty Blackman told WM a few days ago that it is SNP policy to maximise extraction from the North Sea. She was speaking in favour of giving oil companies a taxpayer-funded handout. Same day, Sturgeon was handing £1m to a Swiss playboy in the name of fighting climate change.
8029 2018-12-16 21:27:01 As always! Check out the tweets on @AlistairBurtUK the man who signed us up! Proof that the UN runs on oil & big business. Their plan 2030 is about to get a serious wake up call.
8030 2018-12-16 21:26:50 Nice! Had an attic just like it in my last house, and loved it. Learned to oil paint up there, (brushing along with Bob Ross on a little tv) and had the other half arranged for darts with friends.
8031 2018-12-16 21:26:48 total oil and gas in canada is about 8% of the economy. oil sands less than half of that - as the economy grows that proportion will drop.

8036 2018-12-16 21:25:05 Notice Barwell said he didn't *want* a second referendum. I don't *want* to do the washing up but I will *have* to. I am learning that you have to watch what they say very carefully. Snake oil salespeople the lot of them.
8037 2018-12-16 21:25:03 Yeah don’t call out Quebec hypocrisy on calling Alberta oil bad but have no problems using it and leeching billions in equalization from it , you’re a bigger fool & hypocritical asshat than the Quebec scumbags in government - go away
8038 2018-12-16 21:24:51 I agree about that in regards to the wild black walnuts but the English walnuts are a little better. FYI If you get a scratch in your wood floor or furniture you can take the meat of the nut and rub it into the scratch to cover it up. It’s the oil that does it. Happy cashews 2 u

8042 2018-12-16 21:24:33 CBD oil from hemp is 100% legal in every state, as far as I know.  You can also use combination formulas like Hempanol by North American Herb & Spice.  Check also with naturopaths and chiropractors in your area and try to find at least one you're comfortable with. Best wishes.
8043 2018-12-16 21:24:24 You have totally missed the point that Saudi oil is processed in Canada and shipped to Quebec. An Energy East pipeline would take Canadian oil east, refine it and sell it to Quebec. A made in Canada solution..but apparently Quebec, prefers theocratic product.
8044 2018-12-16 21:24:20 You see your mentality.... How much is yam? How much is palm oil? How much is rice? How much is toiletries? Do you even know what you saying? So they'd buy rice 5naira, garri 2 kobo? Soap 50k.... And feed with 3k for a month.... Be real

8047 2018-12-16 21:23:44 Straws are more of a distraction than an issue in and of itself. The problems are plastic, CO2, fossil fuels, fracking, oil spills, pollution with hormonally active substances like BPA, pthalate levels in pregnant women, global warming, climate change, habitat destruction, etc.
8048 2018-12-16 21:23:43 Yes, Ryan Zinke has accomplished much in his two years of being in the pocket of big oil and coal!!! He’s under 17 separate ethics investigations due to his wanton disregard for his money grab.  Lining his wife’s pockets with quid pro quo deals!!! #TrumpCrimeSyndicate

8051 2018-12-16 21:23:33 "Annual CDN oil transported on the Pacific Coast amounts to 6 million tonnes, while US oil tankers transport six times as much through same CDN waters, at 37 million tonnes."

Yet, no ban on US tankers

8052 2018-12-16 21:23:14 Gerald
In my life time facts have never mattered much to Liberals.

What you're saying is that Quebec is in favour of pipelines that feed them oil but have a deep principled concern for the environment that compels them to oppose pipelines that might help others.  
8053 2018-12-16 21:23:06 If we became more depended or remained as depended as before, the demand for pure crude oil would remain as high as before, and it’d be more profitable to sell crude internally, to feed energy consumption needs, than to use that crude to make “plastic products” to export.
8054 2018-12-16 21:23:02 Bruce Willis walking around an oil rig trying to shoot Ben affleck with a shotgun. Wtf. Well a sackable offence #Armageddon
8055 2018-12-16 21:22:37 Republicanism at it's highest. Oil company, really. No, will not believe anything that comes out of fossil fuel/Republican group.

8057 2018-12-16 21:22:36 We will always need oil and gas so dont panic
8058 2018-12-16 21:22:12 That large emitter program is what @jkenney wants to go back to, so nothing will change for oil sands under him.
8059 2018-12-16 21:22:01 Old furniture, walls and windows grungy, overlooking the freeway or a strip of fast food... far away from any 'real' restaurants, the breakfast was... well, when we got there it was a vat of greasy biscuit gravy with no biscuits, and four sad gray sausages in a pool of orange oil
8060 2018-12-16 21:21:30 U guys really thought you'd win?
8061 2018-12-16 21:21:22 We did get closer to energy independence. 

1. We’ve produced more oil. 
2. We’ve produced more products that offset need for oil. 
3. We’ve exported more oil products (meaning, the market demand for oil was lower for some than the market demand for oil products).

8078 2018-12-16 21:18:08 While most people watch cat videos on YouTube, I spend my time watching videos on how fracking and oil wells work.
8079 2018-12-16 21:18:08 Apologies I got my billions and millions messed up.  Canada’s oil production is 4.2 Million barrels/day.
Diversification is easier with money, even if it’s oil money.  But, that’s a different question.
8080 2018-12-16 21:18:03 I like Shea moisture’s Black castor oil line, and actual Jamaican black castor oil, As I Am leave in conditioner does wonders for my hair, moisturize and then seal with an oil, also use a shampoo or denman brush to detangle they don’t snag at your hair

8090 2018-12-16 21:16:44 This is good news. We now know that we can cut off Quebec from the bulk of its oil.
8091 2018-12-16 21:16:40 It smells like gun oil and desperation.
8092 2018-12-16 21:16:35 So glad my baby hair really growing back. I do her ponytails every weekend for the whole week. Sometimes longer than that they can last. Just oil it and tie it down no matter if it’s frizzy or not. Her shit sprouting

8099 2018-12-16 21:14:58 Reduce all oil uses, reduce length of all supply chain. Convert all unemployment in machine-less farming and permaculture. Repair everything, design 300 kg cars, velomobiles, etc. "Sustainable development" will never work but the solar panels will help keep some of the lights on.
8100 2018-12-16 21:14:44 Yeah I usually use a nice Sandalwood beard oil
8101 2018-12-16 21:14:41 Needs to be oil then butter like a proper schnitzel and I won’t hear otherwise.
8102 2018-12-16 21:14:28 It's raining here and the puddles are all iridescent-y. They are pretty even though I know they are iridescent because of the layer of oil and grease coming to the surface. In other words, the pretty colors are really because of pollution.
8103 2018-12-16 21:14:25 Sometimes only coconut oil will do the trick 
8104 2018-12-16 21:14:25 Are you harvesting for oil or fiber?
8105 2018-12-16 21:14:17 Heard in the Lucas Oil Stadium before the Colts-Cowboys game:  Some Cowboys front office personnel flew from Dallas to Kansas City Saturday and drove to Indy. While on the way, they made a stop in Terre Haute and took a picture with the Larry Bird statue outside Hulman Center.
8106 2018-12-16 21:14:11 You might have to go other ways to get it, regulators are way behind.
Say a story recently with a mum sourcing it for her child on the quiet.
I used to smoke all forms recreationally, from what I've seen described the oil effect seems different anyway.
8107 2018-12-16 21:14:00 Don't forget Newfoundland, PEI, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia - if BC gets an oil tanker ban then those Provinces should get bans as well.  The West can send them oil by rail.

8111 2018-12-16 21:13:18 William, thanks for posting this. My father was there in XXX Corps, He said it was the coldest winter he'd ever known, so cold the oil in the Machine Guns froze. That's going straight on my Christmas book list .

8113 2018-12-16 21:12:52 First, his cooperation with Hitler in 1939 made WWII possible. All Hitler's invasions since 1939 including 1941 on USSR (early phase) ran on Stalin's oil.
Then, he exterminated / enslaved millions. 
Clear, he was a communist!

8124 2018-12-16 21:12:06 Again, Equalization is based upon a Province's "fiscal capacity":
Personal income taxes
Business income taxes
Consumption taxes
*Up to 50 percent of natural resource revenue (*Oil, *Gas, Coal etc)
Property taxes & misc
Alberta's resource sector directly impacts "fiscal capacity".

8127 2018-12-16 21:12:05 I reread what I wrote a few times and I saw nothing regarding supporting candidates getting PAC money.  In fact, one may say I was going for the opposite of injecting a large flux of cash into the campaign system. Or, we could cross our fingers and hope Beto's oil $ means nada.
8128 2018-12-16 21:12:03 So today I managed to get $125 before tax oil change for $65 after tax. 
8129 2018-12-16 21:12:00 Whether or not we need what the machines produce is up to debate, but he's not wrong our entire economic-techno-industrial system runs on oil. 
Endless economic growth is by definition not sustainable in a closed system. The only viable solution is to produce and consume less.

8134 2018-12-16 21:11:49 You need some @FireCider some Oregano Oil, and airborne. If you can’t breath out your nose, also add X-Clear nasal spray.

8141 2018-12-16 21:10:38 Betcha it's light sweet oil. That most refineries can process.
8142 2018-12-16 21:10:34 Short-term profits that ruin the environment and isn't sustainable. 

Oil and gas is Heavily subsidized. It's a joke. They are irresponsible leaches.
8143 2018-12-16 21:10:18 Shill........your literally arguing for oil companies. What a noob u are at this. :)
8144 2018-12-16 21:10:16 How are they “supporting oil and gas?”

8146 2018-12-16 21:09:49 All I know is that my time working at Cineplex was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Minimum wage, horrendous health code violations, absolute layered filth of popcorn, butter/oil, sticky dried-up pop.
8147 2018-12-16 21:09:43 Remember kids, that's a big merry Christmas from Gerald and Justin to 100,000 oil industry workers soon to be on welfare thanks to these two clowns. Can you feel the love?
8148 2018-12-16 21:09:41 @theNSLC cannabis menu is not  clear or explained. I said “one” of a sativa type and stone oil. Upon looking at bill, I noticed 3.5 sativa. Upon refund, they ‘misunderstood’ my one to  mean one lack @ 3.5. Not satisfactory.
8149 2018-12-16 21:09:32 Never in my life have I ever felt like an idiot until I had to go get the oil changed in my car by myself.... where is my dad what is going on where do I park my car ???

8152 2018-12-16 21:09:24 Got my Dry Shampoo for free this month which is a $32 Value! It leaves my hair fresh and clean! Adds volume to my locks. Provides texture and lift. Absorbs oil with rice starch. 

Waterless shampoo that absorbs oil, refreshes my hair and helps to extend my style 2nd and 3rd day!
8153 2018-12-16 21:08:56 You have probably already looked at CBD from hemp oil as it has anti-inflamation properties might be helpful

8155 2018-12-16 21:08:50 There’s resistance to building oil pipelines in the U.S. as well, as anyone following the Keystone XL file will tell you.
8156 2018-12-16 21:08:49 Yeah I read the same. Foreign oil imports have been steadily declining over last decade or two.
8157 2018-12-16 21:08:47 This is a confused person with eyes oogying with eyes oogying with oil.
8158 2018-12-16 21:08:40 From the article you cited:
“So, indeed when you consider crude oil and finished products, for the week ending 11/30/18, the U.S. was a net exporter of 0.2 million BPD of crude plus finished products.”
8159 2018-12-16 21:08:39 Actually, the #oil and #coal industry is increasing #pollution in urban, city settings and making life for homeless #veterans even worse. Not that #bigoil seems to care.

8161 2018-12-16 21:08:27 Like steel? Oh because the Genesis has no steel, I see. Look up lithium mining vs oil sands. EVs win hands down when it comes to cradle to grave pollution - even when powered by 100% fossil fuel electricity. Plus the tesla 3 is cheaper and faster than this gas guzzler.

8164 2018-12-16 21:08:13 No. No, no, no. Well, depends on the steak. Tavern steak, Micmac Bar and Grill steak - yup. But a thick-cut pastured ribeye, seared in a cast iron pan for two minutes each side, just salt and pepper and olive oil, tented for 10 minutes so the juices can settle ... FOOD OF GODS.
8165 2018-12-16 21:08:06 Oils a generic term. Lamp oil, whale oil, fish oil, olive oil, wti oil, brent oil, wcs oil. Youre not great with semantics

8167 2018-12-16 21:08:01 First the VP never talked about the last fuel subsidy regime backlog which have already been verified by the previous admin before they left govt, which the current admin have start paying the oil markets who's claim have been verified already.

8169 2018-12-16 21:07:53 Yes. I can walk down the road from my home to the beach here in Blackpool and no longer have to sidestep oil slicks, shit, condoms etc. Now we have recognised clean beaches.
8170 2018-12-16 21:07:48 I drove through a part of LA today that had several oil rigs, digging away like those bird things that drink water. 

I felt sad, and like the things I loved were expensive in ways I could never repay.
8171 2018-12-16 21:07:38 The media relies on advertising revenue from oil companies.
8172 2018-12-16 21:07:29 And when Trump stripped regulations to bolster US energy production and pressed OPEC to lower oil prices, was that all part of the collusion?

Asking because energy exports are critical to Russia.

8176 2018-12-16 21:06:50 I can feel my insides protest against the large amount of hot oil I have consumed today.

8178 2018-12-16 21:06:37 Made the sundried tomato sausage. Fried the garlic in oil. Stir fried the spinach. Waited for the water to boil for the pasta for ten minutes just to realize I never turned the burner on.
8179 2018-12-16 21:06:30 “squirrel oil” made me actually snort

8189 2018-12-16 21:05:12 Energy East would have backed out Saudi oil though. And given the federal government forced the withdrawal of Energy East it could be easily stated that the Cdn government forced Irving to buy non-Canadian oil. That is a mind blowing statement if you think about it.

8229 2018-12-16 21:01:05 Would you not think being an economist it would be better to use a domestic supply that is selling way below market values to supply domestic needs rather than buying US oil at full market price?

8272 2018-12-16 20:56:26 We want to keep the Earth but we can't afford financial and security to keep getting oil from over seas  where it is sent to be refined. We have to be financially safe too!!
8273 2018-12-16 20:56:05 All of you writers on the payroll broke out the anointing oil because he had a monster 4th quarter last week ...what you all failed to write about was why we were in that position to begin with. He missed low, high and holds the ball to long...blah, blah, blah.
8274 2018-12-16 20:56:04 How is the US a political circus? Don’t you mean the #fakenews? Trump is a patriot trying to do right by his country. First time in 60 yRs US is worlds no1 oil producer. The UN is to blame for the unrest in Europe Australia heading the same way
8275 2018-12-16 20:55:49 Husband is in Indy visiting our son so they could go to Lucas Oil Stadium to watch their Cowboys get beat up on. He's still having fun, though, 'cause that's my guy.

8280 2018-12-16 20:55:00 Extra virgin olive oil didn’t go to law school
8281 2018-12-16 20:54:35 Further, the subtitle was “Crude, refined products exports exceed imports in weekly data
Shale boom has boosted U.S. crude oil shipments to record,” which isn’t inaccurate if you consider “oil” to mean a category including “finished/ processed oil products.”  3/
8282 2018-12-16 20:54:28 Wouldn't it be a shame if all us sole traders boycotted @WorcesterBosch from now on. I'm going to start fitting grant oil boilers dont fit Worcester gas these days anyway out of principle. Just a shame as a trade we dont stick together enough!
8283 2018-12-16 20:54:23 “I doubt that will happen at this point you and she water and oil you don’t mix . And you made the stupid mistake of beating her in front of her siblings and the two other times as well. She will never forgive you for that.”
8284 2018-12-16 20:54:21 WHO MADE MACRON FOR PRESIDENT OF FRANCE - BANKS,MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, MILITARY INDUSTRY COMPLEX, OIL COMPANIES ... MACRON IS FIGURE , HIS SUPPORTERS IS REAL ENEMY. THIS LIBERAL WAY OF DEMOCRACY COMES FROM USA ACROSS THE WORLD. USA IS A CANCER OF THE WORLD SYSTEM.

8287 2018-12-16 20:54:02 Should get into car sales, got the gift of the gab, or maybe a snake oil salesman, or wait, best of all, a politician or lawyer
8288 2018-12-16 20:54:02 Just spit-balling here, after looking at these 2 pictures...maybe less Olive Oil?

8293 2018-12-16 20:53:25 still learning about having oil, there is a risk we may run out before it comes!
8294 2018-12-16 20:53:18 That's easy. They can help by stop producing oil and gas, going bankrupt and silently disappear from this world. 
Yes. That does include your greenwashing project. #FckSky, #FckShell, #Youth4Climate, #BoykottShell
8295 2018-12-16 20:53:08 I hate the fact that tea tree oil is so strong scented but that shit works wonders so
8296 2018-12-16 20:53:06 Have you been to South Africa? Dirty and trash everywhere. Have you been to Cairo? Paris? Moscow? London? So dirty. Beijing? The air is yellow from pollution.  This country is clean, Sir. we have less pollution than in the 1970s! We are using less oil than in the 1990s. Progress

8299 2018-12-16 20:52:49 I know this is hard for you to understand...better to use Alberta oil since we don’t kill reporters and put women in jail and respect human rights. God gave you a brain Gerald please start using it.

8302 2018-12-16 20:52:33 Why is it absurd? It’s a given Iraq was occupying Kuwait. However there is context, a long standing dispute over oil prices & stolen reserves. There you go with that word “Regime” again & Propaganda caricatures about Putin. It wasn’t Putin that destroyed Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan
8303 2018-12-16 20:52:22 This is the longest I had to wait for an oil change

8305 2018-12-16 20:51:56 My horse and donkey have always only been fed grass hay and a cup of black oil sunflower seeds and are very healthy. They occasionally get short periods in the pasture. The muzzle didn’t work on the donkey because he immediately ate a hole in the bottom. He’s smart that way
8306 2018-12-16 20:51:46 The media corporations have become more powerful than "Standard Oil" even was.

8310 2018-12-16 20:51:02 ^^ definitely do the coconut mix. Even doing castor oil, coconut & argan oil mix is real good. I can get you a little container that comes with a mascara brush so you can use that!
8311 2018-12-16 20:50:35 QB recieves zero oil from SA, and most oil is from Canada. Facts matter.

8315 2018-12-16 20:50:02 The Bloomberg article says “America turned into a net oil exporter last week, breaking almost 75 years of continued dependence on foreign oil and marking a pivotal - even if likely brief - moment toward what U.S. President Donald Trump has branded as "energy independence." 2/
8316 2018-12-16 20:49:58 That’s the ignorance of Zimbabweans. You just talk without knowledge. The Americans shoot black people in the streets everyday, while they send citizens to fight wars for the private interests of the military industrial complex & oil companies. Is that constitutional?
8317 2018-12-16 20:49:57 hey chris let the owl drink my oil
8318 2018-12-16 20:49:54 Dear mr. President please drill for the oil that we already own up north show that we are not under the influence of some other Nation for oil consumption and save this nation from so much agony God bless you

8321 2018-12-16 20:49:38 By which I mean they’re still selling their guilt ridden snake oil to unhappy, gullible kids, not that I’ve got the devil speaking through me. Although having said that ...
8322 2018-12-16 20:49:20 #Np OIL by @phynofino #SundayNightPartyMix With @DJAboki1 #InDaMix
8323 2018-12-16 20:49:16 My mother used to heat up "camphorated oil" (as she called it) on the stove in tinfoil pans she'd saved from various TV dinners and refrigerated foods. Then she'd slather that on our chests using a wad of cotton balls.
8324 2018-12-16 20:49:12 What do we do?
Take best of three?
SNP are only bothered about their oil on the coast of the UK!
Let's remember where you get your money from eh!
You cannot keep having elections.the cost.
Let's just get out.
I'm a remainder but I've had enough. Get out This Island will be ok.
8325 2018-12-16 20:49:09 We should be using our oil and gas and mineral resources to build plants HERE IN CANADA to produce this technology. We don’t need to burn coal. We have massive amounts of abundant energy from water, oil, gas, solar and wind.

We can and should be doing this.
8326 2018-12-16 20:49:08 Oil and Vinegar Unilingual?
8327 2018-12-16 20:49:04 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
8328 2018-12-16 20:48:56 Why does Kirk Cousins look like the tin man without the oil?
8329 2018-12-16 20:48:52 does anyone want an essential oil roller keychain thing ??? you fill it with essential oils and can roll it on your skin throughout the day. it comes with a bunch of them and I NEED ONE so i think i'm going to sell the rest for like $5
8330 2018-12-16 20:48:43 Because the end game is to strand Canadian oil.
8331 2018-12-16 20:48:30 Or changed the oil...
8332 2018-12-16 20:48:22 BTW, "drastically"? the G&M article says "While Quebec’s refineries do not disclose the sources of the oil they  use, most of it now consists of conventional light crude from Alberta  and shale oil from the United States", so at least 50%
8333 2018-12-16 20:48:09 Ridiculous excuse ! Simply straight up gouging of the public after oil is hitting rock bottom.Prices should be around $1.15 a litre out west.Investigations need to be conducted.
8334 2018-12-16 20:48:06 Rail cars will move oil to port while the pipelines go through the courts. The alternative is to do nothing and lose money. Don't these people understand that?
8335 2018-12-16 20:48:04 Something about Lucas Oil Stadium and teams not being able to score
8336 2018-12-16 20:47:58 *puts drops of lavender oil in my diffuser and pretends i don’t have 2 exams in the next 3 days*

“this is fine”
8337 2018-12-16 20:47:50 In the case of the BPS report, their findings were “water = oil” and their solution, as always, was more market-based reforms to solve the problems of market-based inequity.
8338 2018-12-16 20:47:47 OIL PANIC IS A REFLECTOR!!!!! OIL PANIC IS A REFLECOTR NOW THAT’S SO CRAZYYYY
8339 2018-12-16 20:47:41 How can you call the man stupid? Obama never had a 2% GDP in 8 yrs.  Trump has been 3 & 4% in 2.  Many less on foodstamps because they have jobs.  Oil independence and exporting.   Remember Obama said you have a magic wand?  Why yes he does.  Obamacare unconstitutional,last call.
8340 2018-12-16 20:47:28 Do you want me push it with oil or not my muse?
8341 2018-12-16 20:47:25 It better happen soon Mr. President before the markets really start tanking.  Now amount of jawboning about tariffs, russia, oil, corrupt lawyers & politicians etc. is going to stop the inevitable train reck, unless you've got a magic wand for "real" growth.
8342 2018-12-16 20:47:24 is that oil thing an instant kill or what
8343 2018-12-16 20:47:15 I don’t give a damn what American Petroleum Institute or anyone affiliated with them has to say about drilling for oil. Leave it there. No one gets killed, the marine life will survive, and our climate will be better off. Go solar or hydroelectric.
8344 2018-12-16 20:47:10 Yes I need the thermometer..the oil temp is everything 
8345 2018-12-16 20:46:48 I'm going to my mom's house to take reference pics for a comic (and to visit my family too I guess lol) and if I can remember I'll take some nice pics of the oil painting of a Porsche I did years ago. It's still a really beautiful painting

1)What we operate for pms is price modulation which was based on worse case scenario of $60/bbl @ #145/l.
2)Anytime price of crude oil is <$60/bbl, NNPC makes profit from #145/l.
3)Anytime price of crudeoil is >$60/bbl, NNPC underrecovers @ #145/l.

8351 2018-12-16 20:46:01 Bailout and oil sector need not be used in the same sentence. No one is angling for government dependency, just trying to overcome government inadequacy. #CdnPoli #AbPoli
8352 2018-12-16 20:45:53 Anyone ever use Fry Light? Because I hate it. I cook with it and I cremate everything and I mean everything. I cook with olive oil and it's like I turn into Jamie Oliver in the kitchen. Nicest dinner ever. While my fry light dish looks like it should be put in an urn...
8353 2018-12-16 20:45:42 USA: did you say oil!? Oh ok I think you need some freedom.
8354 2018-12-16 20:45:21 @MichelleRempel Michelle, I warned everyone about SadSocks.  He wears the Canadian flag on his feet, Mr Harper wore it acrossed his chest, enuf said.  But I digress, can u explain to me how oil royalties are paid and how do the Feds get their peice of the pie.
8355 2018-12-16 20:45:16 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8356 2018-12-16 20:45:13 There is no good reason why Canada can’t do what China is doing. Except for the factbtgatbthenpolicy debate is skewed to benefit oil and pipeline companies and not our society as a whole. 

As a result you and I argue over a loonie and others walk away rich.
8357 2018-12-16 20:45:12 When Caroline said "I can't guarantee the safety of your friends of questionable character" I think she was talking about both Blake AND Yang. Friend(s)=Plural. Blake for being a Faunus and Yang for the Mercury incident and her disability.
8358 2018-12-16 20:45:02 Also there is a very substantial field (oil and gas) south of Hook Head Wexford. It just needs the economics to make it viable.
8359 2018-12-16 20:44:51 You would think when a woman is prescribed a shot of Dr. John's Root Oil 
taken orally she would be suspicious.
They usually are when I prescribe it.
8360 2018-12-16 20:44:27 Get an oil drum of Teflon lubricant from AutoZone and roll with it

8365 2018-12-16 20:43:36 Good to know, our Mazda could probably use a detailing after the drive up to NY for Xmas. Do you know how to make the arrangements? Think they do oil changes as well?
8366 2018-12-16 20:43:19 Prolly getting cbd oil lol
8367 2018-12-16 20:43:08 Overheard on a hike in Portola Valley...1st person: “I read that @Benioff said that data is the new oil”. 2nd person: “actually, data is the new garbage”

8369 2018-12-16 20:42:59 I need my mans to come back and give me another c*nnabis oil massage
8370 2018-12-16 20:42:48 Just on a pure economic policy. Canada would be totally effed. Our dollar is based off oil currently. With no oil production our dollar would get a serious beating. BC would totally be isolated. Alberta would instantly see trump tax cuts and adopt a US dollar.
8371 2018-12-16 20:42:37 Right! CBD Oil has been very effective for my anxiety as well!!
8372 2018-12-16 20:42:31 “Our generation will never be able to fly (among other things), other than for emergencies. Because the adult generations have used up all our carbon budget.” Emergencies? I wish it will be the case. More probable for bombing other countries and get the last drops of oil! :-(
8373 2018-12-16 20:42:30 I think that was the oil they found

8376 2018-12-16 20:42:16 Do you know how hydrogen is produced? Either through immense use of electricity (splitting water is not an efficient process) or by processing oil, again using lots of electricity. Battery is more efficient.
8377 2018-12-16 20:41:57 The oil pastels weren't good for shit

8383 2018-12-16 20:41:25 Then #BoycottOil and support massive government investment oil free equitable transportation choices including electric rail and buses plus cycling and walking. Dramatically reducing demand is a sure way to bring oil prices down.

8385 2018-12-16 20:41:19 Hey! A lot of our customers have had a lot of success treating their chronic pain, may I ask what kind of pain you're experiencing? Depending on the location, you might want to consider CBD Salves vs CBD Oil!

screaming oil
8387 2018-12-16 20:41:08 No one told me that using coconut oil after a shower would make me feel like a soft baby
8388 2018-12-16 20:41:02 We're sentient patches of oil swept along down corridors of shadow. #cyberpunk
8389 2018-12-16 20:40:58 oil and vinegar divorcee.....hmm, not sure it really works for me. 
8390 2018-12-16 20:40:58 We love a good death threat at work for making someone walk for peppermint oil.
8391 2018-12-16 20:40:55 Is that were they are from. Don't worry there are so many of these snakes oil salesman that  almost ever state yields one. We have Santorum. About once a week I post that we overwhelming voted against him.
8392 2018-12-16 20:40:51 Yep, all performance oriented engine folks use ethanol for no reason?! We don’t blend ethanol for BTUs/MPGs, it is blended for octane. Been in the fuel biz for two decades, I know propaganda vs. reality. Unfortunately the oil campaigns are well-financed and not all can...
8393 2018-12-16 20:40:46 And for the rest of the day, my new after shave is called 2 stroke fuel with chainsaw bar oil.
8394 2018-12-16 20:40:43 as it is sold direct to offshore destinations. Massive new oil fields found, UK taxes oil cos, hardly anything compared to Norway.  Also if you add GERS for Wales NI and Scotland together it is not credible that England assigns itself hardly any debt with 55m while the small
8395 2018-12-16 20:40:42 What is your solution to removing oil from the supply chain that powers modernity? Do you have one? For instance: which med-tech  do you think our hospitals need to do without to meet targets?  I’ll wait.
8396 2018-12-16 20:40:41 I just yelled, "The stars at night, are big and bright!" And no one clapped afterward, so I think all the #Cowboys fans have officially left Lucas Oil Stadium. #Colts #DALvsIND
8397 2018-12-16 20:40:40 And their argument is that oil sold at 140USD during those years, meaning cost of refined products were higher then. Scam
8398 2018-12-16 20:40:35 And now his assistant, a crony to the oil industry, takes his place. More corruption coming up!!!!
8399 2018-12-16 20:40:27 You can regulate the nicotine in vape  pens. Choosing a lower oil nicotine mg from 18mg the highest and down to 2mg the choice is yours. 
I use 18mg and cut down cigs. I was at 35 cigarettes a day to 16 now. It helps! Just having the vape and not carrying smokes.
8400 2018-12-16 20:40:26 おにーさんにまかせとけー！

8405 2018-12-16 20:39:42 Time for thousands of Cowboy fans to start exiting Lucas Oil with their heads down!
8406 2018-12-16 20:39:27 And what would Alberta do with all it's oil if they separate? All pipelines to BC would be blocked.
8407 2018-12-16 20:39:24 Yessssss the oil is my fave
8408 2018-12-16 20:39:09 JT say's to Solomon "Investment just a li’l down in oil". This clown is either so out of touch or just that arrogant to make such an asinine remark, also add that TMX one-liner he & Morneau like to use about 'Buy'n' TMX??! Kinder Morgan didn't need anyone to buy the f'n thing!
8409 2018-12-16 20:39:03 Infusing Calendula adding Calendula oil to your bath  water will keep your skin soothed from dreaded Winter Skin !
8410 2018-12-16 20:39:00 You might want to convert to Judaism. Better to go with the miracle of oil lasting for 8 days story. Just a thought. #GKG
8411 2018-12-16 20:38:56 dumb oil paint and dog hairs;another fucking poem;so much dog hair;;;it never stops.
8412 2018-12-16 20:38:48 “The national message, intended or not, seems to be: you are poisoning the earth but send us your billions in oil revenue until we implement policies that will strangle your economy.
8413 2018-12-16 20:38:44 I’m way over due for a oil change.. I need to stop playing and go get one
8414 2018-12-16 20:38:35 GERS is constructed in such a way that it doesn't represent all our output, tax income, or indeed the situation in an independent Scotland.  It is loaded with UK expenditure that the UK wants to set against the other nations. Much of our oil income is not accounted for /
8415 2018-12-16 20:38:29 He’s a maniac maniac, put his picture up outside of Lucas Oil Stadium @JimIrsay @dsleon45
8416 2018-12-16 20:38:22 Every so often I think about how Carter tried to establish a solar industry and reduce dependency on foreign oil. But he wore a sweater on TV so he had to be destroyed. :(
8417 2018-12-16 20:38:13 Exactly. Because there is no plan linking our current energy sources to the need for full scale transition away from fossil fuels. 

We can only make that transition by using our oil resources to do it. Instead we’re giving them away and charging a tax to pay for our sins.
8418 2018-12-16 20:37:50 Still no sign of Deutschland and my oil is running so low ;_; why won’t she come home #azurlane
8419 2018-12-16 20:37:38 The onlyyyyy reason I would need a boyfriend in 2019 is to harass me until I get my oil changed it’s like at least 10000km past due
8420 2018-12-16 20:37:28 Agreed and as an added measure place a tariff on imported oil. If QC is adamant about importing oil they should have to pay a premium or doing so.
8421 2018-12-16 20:37:22 Había dos pelotudos que se hacían los lindos afuera de la recepción cuando terminó y a uno se le terminó la nafta. Si la nafta , pero esta todo bien por que fuimos a buscar mas a la oil  jajajajaja
8422 2018-12-16 20:37:20 Here we go again.  Trump is trying to get rid of ALL environmental protections.  Drill oil in pristine places, putting our coastlines, wildlife and health at risk.All so the oil companies can turn a profit.Selling out our future all in the name of greed.  This is tragic!!!
8423 2018-12-16 20:37:17 If he's not great, California's wouldn't have brought him back for two more terms as governor. When you talk about 45-55 mins drive, gee whiz, who asked you to stay far away, get on your bike, kick off the excess calories. It's the oil companies bought and dismantled the rails.
8424 2018-12-16 20:37:13 For people who suffer from year sound sinus problems like me, get a cool most humidifier and a diffuser with Peppermint and Eucalyptus essential oil.....It’s a game changer trust me!!!
8425 2018-12-16 20:37:04 Canada should never import oil.
8426 2018-12-16 20:37:03 Cut off their subsidized daycare, they will soon see the importance of Canadian oil
8427 2018-12-16 20:36:54 Nothing was funnier than watching coconut oil debates when folks discovered it.
8428 2018-12-16 20:36:35 Yesterday I tried to buy a completely, 100% legal CBD oil vape pen off of a reputable manufacturer website so I too could experience instant anxiety relief. I didn't think there would be a problem. 

There was, in fact, a problem.

8432 2018-12-16 20:36:17 Well, the saudis have everything to do with motorsport, given they sell oil!
8433 2018-12-16 20:36:07 Do you think this also has anything to do with making sure Genie Oil is protected there?
8434 2018-12-16 20:35:47 Can you make a promise to challenge people that talk of things like a ‘managed no deal’ as if it’s a thing? It’s getting silly now and u, as a major broadcaster, surely have a duty of care to call these charlatans and snake oil salesmen to task. Before it’s too late. Any chance?
8435 2018-12-16 20:35:40 Ok, look for water in the oil, it’ll look like mayonnaise in the oil filler cap. If the oils like that you’ll need an oil change. There is an additive you can put in the water that can seal a slight blow though
8436 2018-12-16 20:35:40 Lucas Oil is by far the worst stadium in the world as far as energy goes
8437 2018-12-16 20:35:37 Bi polar disorder?  You know what else has bi polar disorder?  THE PLANET.  BPD is a made up bs ailment designed only to sell big pharma drugs to idiots who can't tell they're being taken by a snake oil pusher.
8438 2018-12-16 20:35:35 If you were alive 100 years ago, I imagine you be infuriated by the drop in whale oil usage.
8439 2018-12-16 20:35:32 Have you tried Peppermint Oil @siano2020  ??
8440 2018-12-16 20:35:26 I like blanched green beans which you can pre-cook, then when lunch is nearly ready, toss and finish them in hot butter, garlic, olive oil and cracked black pepper.
8441 2018-12-16 20:35:18 Call me crazy- but if you want them to say something nice about you Maybe you should do something nice?

Polluting our streams -selling our Parklands to big oil -killing migrant children 
Turning the country over to Theocrats-rampant cronyism 
Not really high on the list pal
8442 2018-12-16 20:35:15 So ... basically corn (Illinois), oil (Texas), money (New York) and cocaine (Florida)?

8447 2018-12-16 20:34:36 Relevance. Lots of people talking about all the non Canadian oil Quebec imports.
8448 2018-12-16 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
8449 2018-12-16 20:34:15 Oil, oil or oil.
8450 2018-12-16 20:34:14 I actually ate there last night. Burger was good but the fries were so damn greasy and soggyI ate a few and that was the end. They were literally dripping oil
8451 2018-12-16 20:34:08 He’s obviously selling snake oil. $10 for feedback from someone you could easily get by joining a group chat.
8452 2018-12-16 20:33:59 I think that awareness is important.The oil industry has made us dependent upon it in every way, like Nestle, Monsanto, Phizer, Bank America. So divestment is a challenge.
Now that the truly unnecessary behemoth is in a death roll, expect oil in as well as around even our water.
8453 2018-12-16 20:33:57 I want a oil change for Christmas 
8454 2018-12-16 20:33:55 I am genuinely asking you to explain how Scotland can earn (approx) £60bn/year, spend £74bn and subsidise England at the same time. Please don't go back to the 1980's "oil boom".
8455 2018-12-16 20:33:54 น้องดูผอมไปเลยอ่ะ
8456 2018-12-16 20:33:29 Right!  Quebec Liberal economics: sell oil to the US for 20$, buy it back at 60$.  No wonder they need 15 billion$ transfer to make it thru the year!  Quebec hypocrites have oil pipelines everywhere.  Add one more for Canada.  Is that too much to ask?  Apparently, yes.

8461 2018-12-16 20:32:46 Be careful. He's armed with beard oil.
8462 2018-12-16 20:32:43 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
8463 2018-12-16 20:32:14 Pipelines are the safest, most efficient and effective method of moving oil. Anything built today will outlive its usefulness yes, but that's not a reason to ignore demand and do nothing instead.
8464 2018-12-16 20:32:09 I’m opposed to the pipeline expansion currently. But if there was a plan like this that took on energy transition as Canada’s moon shot, I’d be behind it. We have the resources and talent to do it. But we keep pandering to large oil and gas companies and we’re wasting time and $
8465 2018-12-16 20:32:07 I keep hearing about these “misinformation campaigns” funded by big oil. Ive yet to see even 1 real example. Perhaps you could provide even 1 link. And BTW, and campaign that points out all the benefits fossil fuel has provided mankind that last 150+ yrs is not misinformation.
8466 2018-12-16 20:32:07 Get an oil change and trade it in...quickly
8467 2018-12-16 20:31:56 Energy is distilled oil?

8473 2018-12-16 20:30:54 What worries me is to learn that the ceviche, burritos, anticuchos, Spanish wines and Peruvian pisco sour I am eating and drinking are all made of oil.
8474 2018-12-16 20:30:49 Sounds oxymoronic how to mix the oil & the water + others 
8475 2018-12-16 20:30:47 It’s good that you read and don’t just listen to skewed media. Under Carter we realized double-digital inflation and mortgages, gas lines through oil embargoes (I was in em), American hostages for over a year. He would go on TV and chastise is for being bad Americans. Bad times
8476 2018-12-16 20:30:46 Lol. Yaba left patient.
8477 2018-12-16 20:30:30 My grandma used a skillet to deep fry them. The oil usually comes up about halfway. Hope they turn out good!

8480 2018-12-16 20:30:18 I’ve been hearing this kind of trip since the 80s. There’s nothing new in what you’re saying. But you people never worry about dependence when a defense contractor or oil company gets government handouts. You’re only upset when poor people get a meal. Every time.

8484 2018-12-16 20:30:11 I'd like to wrap this up with fracking, Hydraulic fracturing, the technic to reach disperse oil pockets under ground. The result of fracking ctivity is leaving hallow canals under the ground that can be filled up by torrential rain. Then using SCALAR, earthquakes.

8489 2018-12-16 20:29:46 So far the two leaders only say publicly that they agree on the Guterres Framework as a basis. So as a multicommunal movement we are not going to satisfy you by taking sides beyond that. What we can say is we don’t support the status quo or a two state pseudo “solution”.
8490 2018-12-16 20:29:44 Oil
8491 2018-12-16 20:29:43 Quebec is our biggest welfare state. They take more from Canada than they give and then they spend the money given to them on foreign oil.
8492 2018-12-16 20:29:38 I told her about the improvement in our dog’s health on CBD Oil and she wondered if it would help her.

When I said it was made from hemp, she became suspicious. The old stigma strikes again.

But I have facts, research and now first hand knowledge of its wonders, I’ll flip her!
8493 2018-12-16 20:29:33 Olive Oil Never Calls Unlike Your Sisters
8494 2018-12-16 20:29:30 Equalization depends on fiscal capacity for taxation... not GDP.

AB has no PST.

AB is therefore in deficit ONLY because it refuses to tax enough/cut spending enough.

Also AB was running deficits even with $100+/barrel oil.

AB is in deficit by choice.

You're welcome
8495 2018-12-16 20:29:03 What makes me wonder is Kenney has pushed the oil production cap reduction which the large oilsands companies are now saying will have a negative impact on the industry. Betcha they will blame Notley for pushing it through
8496 2018-12-16 20:29:01 I use real oil and soy sauce instead of aminos(?), and serve underneath the potatoes (with real cheese) instead of on top
8497 2018-12-16 20:28:56 Trump supporters... you are being had.  Open your eyes to the onslaught of deceit.  This man is a snake oil salesman.  Don’t be duped.
8498 2018-12-16 20:28:54 Been procrastinating this oil change for about a week now.

8501 2018-12-16 20:28:37 Are they all funded by the fossil fuel companies.  The only ones from #climatedeniers are those funded by big oil or coal companies.
8502 2018-12-16 20:28:26 And Schröder? No he don’t like this, why we have to stop this.
America would deliver Fraking oil with all the chemicals you have to pump in the soil.
Remember the current discussion about climate change makes environmental compatibility of products more important than ever before
8503 2018-12-16 20:28:22 You would think so but you must remember that the big oil companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron think a carbon tax is a great idea. A carbon tax would be fabulous for the seven sisters limit competition from fracking and enable their oil networks to game the rube goldberg system

8510 2018-12-16 20:27:43 @sindark What is your solution to removing oil from the supply chain that powers modernity? Do you have one? Don’t quote your blog which has no meaningful content. Hypothesize a solution. Let’s have it.
8511 2018-12-16 20:27:41 Use some oil and balm from @ManCave nor too bad at all really, the oil is nicely scented. Expensive for what it is though.

8514 2018-12-16 20:27:28 "there are numerous self-assessment tools being promoted to help companies determine their readiness for it"?

Some remember 1999, and the potential catastrophe to move from 31/12/1999 to 01/01/2000!

$Billions have been spent in snake oil tools to help determine readiness!

A new study on 12/10/18 shows
8518 2018-12-16 20:27:19 .@MichaelEMann @HonorTheEarth @ClimateJusticeNOW @MsEddieD Can't imagine why anyone would be tweeting about big oil and gas suppressing the television, cable, and mainstream media, now that we have maybe 5 years left to mitigate the worst of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.
8519 2018-12-16 20:26:57 If it's cold, it congeals. Try changing the oil after a short run when it's warmed up but not hot. If it's chunky or has different consistency's in it=yep, that's bad.
8520 2018-12-16 20:26:53 Can't go wrong with prime rolled club roast.  Sprinkle with Black Label Borsari seasoning, spray all over with Pam or rub with olive oil first, then Borsari.  Roast at 325 (convection if possible) until internal temp is between 140 and 150, unless you like it super rare. Yum.
8521 2018-12-16 20:26:46 @dandakich Absolutely too many Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil.  They are a little bitter at this point, however.
8522 2018-12-16 20:26:37 So when did energy CHANGE its definition to literally mean OIL! Climate change is a conversation we gotta have! Since I was born, almost 4decades ago, it doesn't rain in December here in Kenya now it does! Everyone is confused!
8523 2018-12-16 20:26:34 In the uk the French fries are vegan because they’re cooked in separate oil from the chicken etc so I’d assume their veggie burgers are the same?x but i know it the us it’s all the same oil
8524 2018-12-16 20:26:17 You could be the Emperor of Antarctica by this time next year.
Your own personal army of penguins.  
Potential oil and mineral mining.
8525 2018-12-16 20:26:08 Here's a wee hint. Mind when Ffoulkes was banging on about the oil and gas in the Clyde area  and then went awfy quiet and ended up in the H O L.?
8526 2018-12-16 20:26:08 Lubricity may be a problem but I'm sure the collective genius of the oil majors could solve that as they did  octane rating in unleaded petrol.

The key is getting the oil cos. to engage with nuclear technology which is outside their current experience. Collaboration will be key.

8531 2018-12-16 20:25:30 US has an ex coal lobbyist as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and an ex oil lobbyist as head of the US Department of the Interior ....you can not make this stuff up
8532 2018-12-16 20:25:14 We provide you with a good part of your water and electricity and not to mention billions in oil revenue....as I said what the hell does England bring to the table that Scotland need..NOTHING
8533 2018-12-16 20:25:09 Hahahaha!! Yep, need those glasses for sure.  Oil of Oregano may not taste good but it helps with getting rid of bacterial infections.
8534 2018-12-16 20:25:08 I let Jeff hit my bowl and I forgot there was oil in it and hes been coughing for 20 mins calling me an asshole 
8535 2018-12-16 20:25:01 i just remembered that once in high school i went to an expo with my art history class and had to watch a video of a naked woman rolling around in olive oil
8536 2018-12-16 20:24:53 What happen to using oil ehn?
8537 2018-12-16 20:24:49 So I mixed together my Africa’s best oil and JBCO for my oil treatment and y’all....my curls were defined. I had to wash it out but it gave me so much moisture omg
8538 2018-12-16 20:24:45 Yes.. if Shell immediately stops producing oil and uses its resources for renewables instead. Why not assist in fusion energy development? There’s a dollar in that clean technology. Just sayin... Leave all fossil fuels in the ground! #auspol

8542 2018-12-16 20:24:15 I have mo problem in the east  taking far more oil from Hibernia and Nova Scotia. No need for pipelines. Line 9 already too much. Soon so much renewable energy, little need for fossil fuels.

8544 2018-12-16 20:24:00 Massage oil too, all dat
8545 2018-12-16 20:23:58 Well he got the best deal possible re NAFTA 2. Ch 19 kept, US corps cannot sue CDN govt, Canada doesn't have to keep sending oil whether we like it or not. He's working on tariffs - how's China doing in that regard?
8546 2018-12-16 20:23:51 bashir is only wanted because he refused to let western oil companies divide his country. south sudan is even worse off now than before.
8547 2018-12-16 20:23:50 Same. Everything looked delicious. I’m ready to do olive oil tasting

8550 2018-12-16 20:23:10 I want my kids to be able to see the pangolin if they want to. Unfortunately it’s critically endangered bc of deforestation (palm oil industry).
8551 2018-12-16 20:23:05 Why are you guys so shameless??? The infrastructure that was not provided in sixteen years of oil boom, you want bubu to provide it in 31/2 years of oil slide.
8552 2018-12-16 20:23:04 so a few people have asked me about my skin care routine as of late. 

i switched the oil cleansing method (because winter) and i wear sunscreen. 

aztec clay mask here and there. 

that’s it. 

the only “tip”  is that i reduced my dairy intake by 95%.
8553 2018-12-16 20:23:04 The way #MUFC are going down, they will soon discover oil
8554 2018-12-16 20:22:48 You idiot.
The big money is on the Denialist side.
Koch Bros, Big Oil, Big Fossil are throwing money at any scientist willing to lie for Denialists.
While govt scientists get by on moderate wages are hard fought for grants.
Doh!
8555 2018-12-16 20:22:48 I wonder how much bigger their equalization dividend would be if AB sold oil to them and profited, rather than buying it abroad. 
8556 2018-12-16 20:22:28 Haha, it's barely broken in! It just ticked over 6k, so I'll be doing all the 6k service work but it's humming along perfectly. Love the DOHC oil/air-cooled boxer, I think it's one of the best engines BMW ever made.

8561 2018-12-16 20:21:37 So does this guy think that the oil arrives in Quebec? He's not aware that it arrives in the maritimes?
8562 2018-12-16 20:21:36 Alex Salmond. Look up how NI came into oil 280 million Barrels worth in 2012. Europe public heard about it but none of UK. No news!! At all for such a massive find. That is due to it being Scotland after UK agreed a referendum in 2012 for 2014. Betrayal at it's best!!

8576 2018-12-16 20:20:11 it took original muckraker slash investigative reporter Ida Tarbell about two years to take J.D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company down.  read Taking on the Trust: The Epic Battle of Ida Tarbell and John D. Rockefeller by Steve Weinberg.  it's a fascinating story; she's awesome
8577 2018-12-16 20:20:03 i’m also not sure if coconut oil has affected my eyes, since i’ve been using that on the dry skin but last night i slept with it on my eyelids and it may have caused the puffiness, i’m hoping my doctor can give me a cream or something to put on it

8580 2018-12-16 20:19:52 After learning about cbd from you I bought some my mum for her sciatica and she’s had her first few decent sleeps this week and she’s convinced it’s the oil! So big thanks
8581 2018-12-16 20:19:44 I assume the "check oil light " has been shining brightly? I wouldn't drive it, until you flush it and then change the oil... Best bet, get your oil changed, tires rotated every 3 or 4 thousand miles... make it a point, then you don't have these "surprises"
8582 2018-12-16 20:19:41 @Wrangler i just bought 2 flannels.  washed and dryed them and they shrunk a whole size...now i look like i robbed them from a little brothers closet....damn i really liked them.  oil rags now.

8584 2018-12-16 20:19:40 Zero. You don't use oil ?
8585 2018-12-16 20:19:38 Apparently @jiffylube allows employees to smoke while they change your oil! Wow
8586 2018-12-16 20:19:26 Yes you did the math and the sum total was that since big oil and food companies have enough recourses to significantly reduce carbon footprint - poor people should have to eat lentils all day.
8587 2018-12-16 20:19:16 I had it once my mom put oil in my hair and straighten it next day i was life free they can’t survive in heat and oil makes it hard for them to stay attached

8589 2018-12-16 20:18:55 Lol, yes. You not understand how trade works? You sell oil outside your nation then you have to bring that money back and pay taxes in the sale nation or you can invest it and bring back the capital untaxed. They fund your social programs in Iran with that capital. Like Norway.
8590 2018-12-16 20:18:48 Because it's expensive to refine. When I was in university 20 yrs ago I had a prof that said we would never extract Alberta oil because it was too expensive. I knew he was wrong & that prices would eventually make it profitable. But I also knew it was vulnerable to low prices.
8591 2018-12-16 20:18:47 What is he going to do when his supporters figure he can’t actually do anything that’s he’s promising? He can’t get AB equalization, he can’t fix the deficit without killing services, AB can’t separate and become some conservative oil utopia, and those jobs aren’t coming back
8592 2018-12-16 20:18:40 Hope so. Hope your stomach is ok after the Starsucks soy oil latte. Like the real stuff personally and avoid Starbucks for the many good local places. I’m a picky pain in the behind when it comes to coffee, food and drink and hotels for that matter.

8606 2018-12-16 20:17:03 Allowing your slender gook wife to get fat is like buying a brand new car and purposely never changing the oil
8607 2018-12-16 20:17:02 It’s called condensate, hydrocarbon liquids that are produced from gas wells. Most of what is produced is bought by oil sands companies. Bitumen won’t flow in a pipeline without it.
8608 2018-12-16 20:16:59 Agree with most of this; however, Saudi oil refined in NB does get consumed in QC too.

8610 2018-12-16 20:16:40 Why is the U.S. a major exporter of oil good?!? That requires fracking which destroys underground water tables and causes earth quakes where no fault lines previously occurred. America of the 1960’s when Trump thinks great had strictest regulation & highest taxes.

8612 2018-12-16 20:16:26 Considering the inflation rate just hit 1 MILLION percent in Venezuela, I don't know if this counts as an "exclusive".
Hyper-inflation has preceded many a collapsed regime. Chavez bet the farm on oil w/ no economic diversity. Maduro followed suit. Oil prices tanked. It's academic

8618 2018-12-16 20:15:45 Frying plantain shirtless and the hot oil just touched my skin. See why I don't like revealing myself to people. Just showed this plantain my shirtless self and look at how the oil repaid me.
8619 2018-12-16 20:15:41 You realize that it’s actually harder to drive a pipeline across another country’s territory right?  So you’re suggesting becoming your own country, removing yourself from any possible trade or governance agreements and imagining that will be easier to get your oil out?

8628 2018-12-16 20:15:13 @JustinTrudeau already flushed 4.5 Billion down the drain in the sector that actually makes money. Bailout of oil is stupidity. We need pipelines.
8629 2018-12-16 20:14:35 it seems kinda counterintuitive but using a moisturizer can actually help with this, sometimes when your skin gets dehydrated it overproduces oil to compensate!
8630 2018-12-16 20:14:26 @MiamiDolphins Tannehill’s release is so slow you can capture it on oil painting.
8631 2018-12-16 20:14:13 I know not all British Colombians are against oil and gas development. But I will never step foot in BC again. I've had just about enough of these self righteous leaf licking, tree hugging ass holes that think they can change the climate.

8635 2018-12-16 20:13:54 Guys, if they give you rice and oil at work this weekend, please bring it to me. I want to donate it. Don’t ask who I’m donating to. Just Take come x

8637 2018-12-16 20:13:35 you should call him out on hos lies. He wants to undermine oil industry because Alberta votes conservative. Climate is an excuse to raise money that fund things like the Clinton Foundation or Aga Khan who in turn fund Trudeau Foundation and Tides etc. He also buys off the media.

8639 2018-12-16 20:13:18 As much as I enjoyed the win today, I can't help but to feel mad that rent boys bought with oil money are the team hunting us at the top. Have all respect for this man, and to see him shake his head to what once was a team to beat in PL is painful

8641 2018-12-16 20:13:05 I wouldn't support a pipeline in nova scotia either. People are starting to look at what is going to be here in future generations.  Oil is not the only way to go. And if you lived in nova scotia you would see wind farms everywhere. And also tidal energy.  The country is changing
8642 2018-12-16 20:12:46 Engine oil it's very thick and refreshing and you get a good value for your money
8643 2018-12-16 20:12:41 Only smoking the finest hash oil I’m 2019. I don’t care if that means smoking less, I’m gonna do what I need to do. I’m sick of smoking inferior product disguised as something I feel okay about spending money on.
8644 2018-12-16 20:12:00 “That’s only going to get worse if Canada’s Cape Bretoners and Newfoundlanders suddenly have a border between them and the oil sands.” So as a Cape Bretoner who lives here with her Ontarian wife and Alberta-born son, how would citizenship work?

8650 2018-12-16 20:11:04 You are the one making the extraordinary claim of a climate catasphophe. You need to provide sufficient evidence. In this case in particular the challenge is much simpler. What is your solution to removing oil from the supply chain that powers modernity? Do you have one?

8654 2018-12-16 20:10:41 Yup. The #cdnpoli mistake of environmentalists: wanting to kill our oil industry instead of promoting responsible development+alternatives
8655 2018-12-16 20:10:40 Do you regularly check your oil?
8656 2018-12-16 20:10:35 Which oil rent???? Lagos just became an oil producing state and even before the advent of oil in Lagos. It contributes clearly more than 45% of the GDP.
8657 2018-12-16 20:10:26 Must be the olive oil

8662 2018-12-16 20:09:57 Two words...peppermint oil. Unless I'm consuming alcohol, the mint oil totally alleviates the hot flashes.
8663 2018-12-16 20:09:52 This is only possible when underpinned by a major global program of renewables growth, electrification and energy storage to replace the existing coal, oil and gas dominated energy paradigm.
8664 2018-12-16 20:09:52 America has completely destroyed Venezuela by preventing it from selling oil on the international markets. The "right-wing" commentators say they deserve it b/c they wanted "socialism". 

There's something sick & twisted about these people.

8671 2018-12-16 20:09:05 also Rosneft sanctions would need to be lifted for Rosneft oil deal 19.5% shares sale Dec. 7, 2016 for Exxon/Rosneft partnership quid pro quo. Again, Trump would need to conspire to get sanctions lifted against CEO Igor Sechin so he + Kushner could personally profit w/ that deal.
8672 2018-12-16 20:09:05 #IWouldBeSlashed too. Came to do my undergraduate studies, then I did a PhD which incidentally was industry funded. I then worked as a postdoc also earning far less than the 30k threshold. Eventually I did work in the oil industry where I started off on 30k.

8674 2018-12-16 20:08:41 21 years of life and I’ve never got to see the Cowboys score in person!!! And after I leave Lucas Oil Stadium that statement will still be true.
8675 2018-12-16 20:08:35 Do you have a home, a car a family that needs goods and services? If so you are complicit. Just bc it sounds good doesn’t make it correct. The attacks on FF/Ab r dangerous and uncanadian. If you really believe what you say, you first, show us how it’s done. No gas, No lng, No oil
8676 2018-12-16 20:08:33 Brussel sprouts boiled in an APA are great, toss them in a little olive oil on the finish
8677 2018-12-16 20:08:33 start rubbin your beard with oil
8678 2018-12-16 20:08:31 Hello oil business. Week after 9-11 USAF flew 450 Saudis  back that feared for their lives free on our dime out of Stewart Air Force Base.
8679 2018-12-16 20:08:28 Sometimes it’s better to take your oil.
8680 2018-12-16 20:08:28 I need a fucking oil change but I don’t want to pay for ...
8681 2018-12-16 20:08:26 Mexico aims to lift oil and gas production by almost 50% in the next six years and in January will award infrastructure and drilling contracts to develop 20 fields.
8682 2018-12-16 20:08:22 Yeah! These weren't quite deep-fried but close enough, quarter inch of canola oil in a sautee pan, so with three of them the oil came all the way up the sides
8683 2018-12-16 20:08:22 Beto needs to suck up to big oil.
8684 2018-12-16 20:08:14 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
8685 2018-12-16 20:08:05 Mumu, if Lagos is supernatural stop collecting oil rent from niger delta. Onuku......
8686 2018-12-16 20:08:03 Come here lemme oil that ass!
8687 2018-12-16 20:08:03 Thanks for asking. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
8688 2018-12-16 20:08:01 The pens are easy to find but the oil cartilage is impossible. And I don’t live in a state where that stuff can be shipped to so I’m really shit out of luck
8689 2018-12-16 20:07:59 Im sure the UK defence secretary is fully aware of the awesome capabilities of the Khinzal....poor bastard has to put on a good show and try to stem the drop in recruits.  turns out people don't generally like murdering foreigners for oil
8690 2018-12-16 20:07:57 Not bottom end... too much hot oil! :-)
8691 2018-12-16 20:07:56 Oil and vinegar debt
8692 2018-12-16 20:07:54 I removed my makeup with coconut oil last night and holy shit... I will never use ordinary makeup wipes again.
8693 2018-12-16 20:07:46 yeah, there may be trace amounts but the point of being vegan is that companies that use animal products won’t get money for animal products. if it is on same machinery of boiled in same oil technically it is vegan by petas 99.9% rule, which is what i follow, others may be strict
8694 2018-12-16 20:07:42 Offre 20 euros à la personne qui me livre là maintenant à domicile un pot de Crispy Oil Lao Gan Ma. 
C’est pour manger tout de suite, à la cuillère.
8695 2018-12-16 20:07:42 why are my beardless brothers hating on men with beards? your gfs juice is his beard oil?

8699 2018-12-16 20:07:00 Word Bank report and Conclusion on How  CORRUPTION is a MAJOR CHALLENGE  is base on Years of study and research. 
I doubt if your "Thesis" can change the Facts on ground.

with CORRUPTION, benefit of Productivity will never get to the People.

Malabu Oil scam is typical example
8700 2018-12-16 20:06:41 using all natural coconut oil as shaving cream when shaving my legs has been the best decision ive ever made, & so is simply putting it on my legs while i shower like wow im soft af
8701 2018-12-16 20:06:32 Ooooooh, I'm used to flat-cooking my hashbrowns like bacon kinda like Waffle House does with almost no oil, I keep forgetting more 'fried' versions exist! XD Yeah I'd be cooking those at medium-low or flat 'low' on my rangetop for 8-10 minutes.
8702 2018-12-16 20:06:30 Sugar scrub exfoliating, & tee tree oil after waxing or shaving>>
8703 2018-12-16 20:06:25 I really honestly aint on anyones side  in this Brexit crap I just love Great Britain  and hate Commies   really until Blair   arrived we all knew where we stood that guy was a charlatan a snake oil salesman in my book
8704 2018-12-16 20:06:24 Haha... it’s not a secret  
Being Vegan for 5+ years & only eating plant-based, organic foods, combined with turmeric juices + using @BO_TA_NY which boosts skin elasticity, is 100% #Vegan, and has avocados, turmeric and apricots in the oil which naturally enhance skin glow 
8705 2018-12-16 20:06:12 Mou is our problem
8706 2018-12-16 20:06:01 This seems like it's gonna backfire and Misakj is gonna pull a Moca from the last story. I swear. HH don't do this to us
8707 2018-12-16 20:05:59 Oil and Gas revenues provided billions and billions into the economy across Canada. Without oil and gas that money does not exist. Even Rachel Notley is figuring that out.
8708 2018-12-16 20:05:38 Steve, very good thread. One additional point to think about: how is it they can actually buildpipe in the US and get their oil to mkt and we can't. Thousands of miles and mlns of bbls in last 5 years while Canada does squat
8709 2018-12-16 20:05:29 People often say fat fills them up more than anything else (peanut butter, steak, spoonfuls of coconut oil, etc)

Makes sense:

1g fat = 9 calories
1g protein/carbs = 4 calories
8710 2018-12-16 20:05:23 Should be neutral since (real import) = (nominal import (price*volume)) / (import price deflator (price)). Given that there are good data on volume of oil imported, it seems strange that price change would not be well taken into account... But your chart is certainly intriguing !
8711 2018-12-16 20:04:40 Cause they don't classify, coincidentally, natural gas as damaging or harmful to the environment. It's like, I need N.G because it heats my home, allows me to cook food etc. Etc. It good. Oil, I don't need that, it's bad. Once N.G becomes "not needed", its bad.
8712 2018-12-16 20:04:37 Your version of the facts you mean? Fact....Canada could supply all of our current needs but still we pay the higher cost to import oil? That makes sense to you? The payments we make and would be making would help the country as a whole! There’s the real facts!
8713 2018-12-16 20:04:12 I’m so pissed.  WTF? WTF? Precious beautiful sacred lands. We don’t need that much oil. The greedy bastards!
8714 2018-12-16 20:04:00 ...and to think it cost more than AT&T stadium or Lucas Oil Stadium
8715 2018-12-16 20:03:56 Health: self-care first. Eat healthy, vit D, C, Fish Oil. Exercise.  go to the best doc. 2nd, 3rd opinions. Your health matters.
8716 2018-12-16 20:03:53 Ditto the S&V Taytos. Or chips! Oil, salt, vinegar - it just works. Also - Apple juice, pineapple, ginger and steam steam steam. 
8717 2018-12-16 20:03:51 Are you suggesting that someone cannot use oil products and talk about risk management at the same time? Not everyone subscribes to #absolutism...
8718 2018-12-16 20:03:46 Some guy asked if he could oil me down at the beach today 
8719 2018-12-16 20:03:43 We have pipelines that go south. In the last few years the US has grown supply and pushed out our barrels so our primary purchaser no longer needs our oil and we have no meaningful alternative, hence the discounts.  We’ve been trying to go West and East, but Que and BC...
8720 2018-12-16 20:03:24 I toss them in olive oil over medium heat until lightly browned, sprinkle with sea salt while warm (smoked sea salt delish!). Great taste and texture chopped over salads.
8721 2018-12-16 20:03:21 Conversation with my daughter Tamara about ukushinka is interesting.

So what is relish in your language? 
It is not pap (nshima) with meat. It is pap and meat. 

By the way, meat  is not part of relish. Just like salad is not cooking oil.
8722 2018-12-16 20:03:14 Yer nae oil painting yersell mate!!!
8723 2018-12-16 20:03:05 Yeah the first one went in very hot oil and blackened on the outside but remained uncooked on the inside so I turned the oil way down so I could leave them in for longer. still not long enough, though!
8724 2018-12-16 20:03:03 2 things against ur conclusion, 1) The govt calls itself Socialist & 2) 95% of exports and 25% of GDP is oil, which was nationalized along w/ big segments of other major parts of the econ. So while the entire econ isn’t govt owned & run, the most important parts are.
8725 2018-12-16 20:03:00 :)  The settlement asset must be "useless" in normal business given debt levels, or else the increase in price needed to reduce debt on a real basis will destroy the global economy.  US move fr gold to oil to back USD required a move in oil fr $2.50 in 1970 to $40 in 1980.
8726 2018-12-16 20:02:45 Have they told you yet that their wife died, and he’s raising his young son/daughter on his own. And he works on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea, blah, blah, blah. I’ve gotten many of those. I play it out a bit then shut them down hard.
8727 2018-12-16 20:02:39 Oil change time I do my lil car so wrong and be mad when it’s mad
8728 2018-12-16 20:02:39 There was no scenario where that was going to be in Alberta's coffers. You could make a credible argument that allowing provincial domain to continue to retain control over oil and gas keeps billions in Alberta's coffers. Cohesion always ebbs and flows.
8729 2018-12-16 20:02:34 And like how? It wouldn't be palm oil if it didn't come from palm oil trees anyway
8730 2018-12-16 20:02:31 My husband hates all things pumpkin spice so I know he won’t mess with the oil I bought 
8731 2018-12-16 20:02:26 So here it goes new clean nutrition and consistent training from tomorrow. 

Please pray for me 

P.s - I love mayonnaise so much that I've found an alternative "Avocado Oil Mayo" if it tastes anything close to mayo I could last this diet lmao!
8732 2018-12-16 20:02:24 Год назад я пошел на концерт кобыл и трупоглазых жаб зная только несколько их песен.
В этом году я пошел на их концерт и из всех сыгранных песен я не знал только нескольких. 
Но в оба раза эта музыка подарила мне невероятные эмоции, было горячо!
8733 2018-12-16 20:02:23 this argan oil smells soooo good I cannot get over it
8734 2018-12-16 20:02:16 Wow this car burns oil really bad
8735 2018-12-16 20:02:15 I need a hot oil treatment
8736 2018-12-16 20:02:08 Anthony Bourdain’s hatred of truffle oil is one of my favorite things about him
8737 2018-12-16 20:02:05 You can believe StatsCan, the data is easily accessible, $22 billion worth of Saudi oil since '08 alone, into the port in NB, then refined, then on to... you guessed it! Quebec and the other provinces. This is just a misleading graphic that is making the rounds today.
8738 2018-12-16 20:01:59 Subsidy was removed at a point, but It resumed when crude oil price jumped in the global market. This impacted the cost of refined products.
8739 2018-12-16 20:01:56 The problem is with greedy politicians with their hands in the pockets of Big Oil & Gas and greedy manufacturers. They all believe in climate change it’s just not profitable for their Greedy ways.

8740 2018-12-16 20:01:55 My method: Boil until *fully* cooked and starting to fall apart, drain and leave to cool a bit. Heat thin film of fat in hot oven (~220C fan) for ~10 mins, toss them in salt & oil & cook until crispy (30-40 min). Got it down pat now!
8741 2018-12-16 20:01:52 I'd say I depend nearly not at all on palm oil, only a few foods I seldom eat contain palm oil
8742 2018-12-16 20:01:50 Holy cow! How long since you had your oil changed?
8743 2018-12-16 20:01:35 During anointing today, the man in front of me was bald, I couldn’t stop laughing in front of the altar when the oil touched his head 
8744 2018-12-16 20:01:29 It's the reverse bro... We earn from crude oil, the price determines how much we earn. Your financial status revolves around your income, it determines what you can do. How would we have been better off with fuel price at 87, with heavier subsidy depleting our reserve?
8745 2018-12-16 20:01:29 A bit of a random one, but does anybody on my TL have any experience with CBD oil? Particularly as it relates to anxiety, sleep issues and mood swings? I'm looking in to trying that before I look at other medical/professional options and would appreciate some opinions
8746 2018-12-16 20:01:28 Drain it, change it then run it... take a ride to get the new oil into the system 
8747 2018-12-16 20:01:25 I finally got more CBD oil. I’m happy now
8748 2018-12-16 20:01:23 ima put cooking oil in ur wax pen
8749 2018-12-16 20:01:02 Trini women known for pouring hot oil into the ears of abusers while they are sleeping also adding finely ground glass to food.
8750 2018-12-16 20:01:01 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
8751 2018-12-16 20:00:54 Skin oil? Hell yeah baby!!!

8757 2018-12-16 20:00:05 Try taking the oil. You don't have to smoke it, you can take it in tablets or drops
8758 2018-12-16 20:00:00 This took an... interesting turn...
8759 2018-12-16 19:59:55 Serious question.
  Who is Big Oil?  Is it Exxon or Aramco (private or national).

Do the NOP's consider divestment a threat?  If not how do you reach them?

#ringthebellforclimate
8760 2018-12-16 19:59:51 They say so much goes into landfills, yet we burn petroleum products (oil & gas) for power and throw plastics full of chemicals into our ground and water. Same with paper and card.

Instead of a blue bin how about a red bin for burnables? Save our earth and water for free power.
8761 2018-12-16 19:59:50 They can justify charging you 40x more for a ticket... Same reason oil for cars is so expensive, they say it's from fossil fuels to keep the price high... Oil is easy to find, no shortage. If you knew oil was easily accessible, your petrol would be worth 5-10 cent litre
8762 2018-12-16 19:59:46 Another Auntie would use the kerosene stove to cook for herself and her kids. Then empty the oil and take the wicks so her abusive husband could not make himself food. GGrandma left for work one morning and went to Venezuela. Never came back until he died.
8763 2018-12-16 19:59:41 I buy low salt Tuna in Olive oil ..won't buy the ones with Soy vegetable water..
8764 2018-12-16 19:59:40 We protested the pipeline down here in Texas. Same issues and add pipes leaking junk into our water system. Our Gov paved the way for them. And he just got re elected. Ugh. Now they are using our ports to ship the oil. Just waiting for another oil spill disaster at this point
8765 2018-12-16 19:59:40 USA wants oil and we have lots .

8769 2018-12-16 19:59:08 Because stopping the blood shed for oil cant be stopped.
8770 2018-12-16 19:59:06 But I think you should really try the oil. I haven't tried it  but I've heard good things about it.

8773 2018-12-16 19:58:32 The problem is the new generation doesnt want anything to do with fossil fuels. They are looking into alternative energy sources. So oil is going to be like coal. They are the future generation. And they are changing things like we did and our ancestors did.
8774 2018-12-16 19:58:12 Ik you said oil free, but I use jojoba oil 100% pure & it absorbs into the skin very easily. It’s also non comogenic or w/e
8775 2018-12-16 19:58:07 Off deliveroo. You know they didn’t even bother serving it with sambal, just a few thin slices of chilli in oil 
8776 2018-12-16 19:57:56 My car used 1 pint of oil per tank of juice at least,  it was by no means a bomb either

8778 2018-12-16 19:57:34 Crude oil imports grew to 759 Mb/d in 2016, a 1% increase. Canada’s main sources for overseas imports in 2016 were Saudi Arabia (11%), Algeria (11%), Nigeria (10%), and Norway (6%). Guess what happened 2017, 2018, and future. #LiberalLogic
8779 2018-12-16 19:57:34 As for Syria that has zero to do with me not wanting WMDs on my doorstep....if UK hadn't interfered in the Middle East for many many years in their oil wars we would never have gotten to this point
8780 2018-12-16 19:57:18 750 dollars?.. what an f’ing joke ... that’s probably how much his oil change at the Bentley dealership costs...

8782 2018-12-16 19:57:13 All the cowboys fans in Lucas Oil are fuming and it’s so hilarious  Sorry you travelled from Texas to not even score any points in over half the game.
8783 2018-12-16 19:57:12 Sounds like she's talking about you! Will you be having an after Christmas sale on the snake oil you're trying to hock?
8784 2018-12-16 19:57:07 And then there is the Palm Oil...
8785 2018-12-16 19:57:00 Because I support climate action and many who are advocating Alberta oil do not.
8786 2018-12-16 19:56:56 Big statement to dismiss the analytical teams, economists,  and executives at Suncor and CNRL. Is it not possible that they view this as a path to maximizing their returns on heavy oil long term? Read some of @ShellScenarios or Tzertzakian etc... for more context.

8788 2018-12-16 19:56:34 I’m about to start taking primerose oil. I hope this shit works 
8789 2018-12-16 19:56:34 If the supply increases, the prices will drop sharply and the investment will stop and the oil producers will come out with the highest cost 
What is the low supply and prices will see a sharp rise !!
This is simply the equation
Market stability and supply assurance are the goal
8790 2018-12-16 19:56:28 If this is the [the art of the deal] to fail at everything you touch and go bankrupt a half dozen times, I’d say quit telling us how great you are and how much your making America great again. Talk about fake ,Trump is nothing but a con man selling snake oil. So many got bit.
8791 2018-12-16 19:56:22 Yep. It’s great. I don’t believe in keeping the oil in there forever though, I’m too scared of food borne illnesses...even though the heat would probably kill everything, I know...so we just do 7-10 days in a row. 
8792 2018-12-16 19:56:17 Hahaha sizimenezo panopa mpira wathu ukufunika working hard...and iwobi does that...oil make us play with 10 Men...panopa azilowa home games basi..At least we don't get exposed
8793 2018-12-16 19:56:03 my dad is annoying me so i guess I’ll change my oil Alone even if it takes me forever with my Weak arms
8794 2018-12-16 19:56:00 Yea I know. Disagree with Rystad on this. Be careful. There are graveyards of people who thought Shale was a small, expensive, unsustainable resource and therefore oil price had to go up.

8802 2018-12-16 19:54:23 Apparently straight and furry is seen as water and oil for peeps.
8803 2018-12-16 19:54:18 Shows how much of an idiot you truly are. Take all oil and gas products out of Whistler then and see what's left. How are you going to get all the goods needed to run Whistler. Horse and carriage.  Get your head out of your ass. #dontbeabrock

8805 2018-12-16 19:54:07 A few million Europeans migrate to Kuwait and in one generation you’ll have all that oil.
They have to welcome you
8806 2018-12-16 19:54:07 I can’t pee
8807 2018-12-16 19:54:05 No, it very often doesn't work like that ... hence the third chart. A fall in oil prices will boost the nominal surplus, but depress net exports because it lifts *real* imports via the import price deflator. Q4 could be such a case given the big oil price drop in Nov.

8810 2018-12-16 19:53:47 As Saudi oil imported to Quebec
8811 2018-12-16 19:53:45 Heres a tasty tip. A1, worcestershire, tabasco, canola oil all mixed up to your liking. Once youve marinated and your meats about a little over half way cooked and the veggies saute pour a little bit of that on there and theyll coat themselves in that and your set baby.
8812 2018-12-16 19:53:42 martw się o siebie-nie masz mózgu bo PO wygryzło
8813 2018-12-16 19:53:35 Actually getting my oil changed by myself for the 1st time today 
8814 2018-12-16 19:53:35 You're just too busy lying to the public to get back in power that you don't bother to check that 80 % Quebec"s oil comes from Canada & U S through Em bridge 9 pipelines! Right wing & it's supporters will go on being dishonest and use their alternative facts to deceive Canadians!
8815 2018-12-16 19:53:31 After this Ethel dripped Olbas oil on Ron's foreskin whilst he took his afternoon nap
8816 2018-12-16 19:53:31 Hello, how much is this please and does it contain palm oil?
8817 2018-12-16 19:53:28 Omo, see somewhere in Nigeria  
Oil money when manage well, good oooo
8818 2018-12-16 19:53:25 But where is the coconut oil
8819 2018-12-16 19:53:14 Can't be the only one that grew up to believe that eating groundnut or anything that contains oil causes pimples even tho it's not scientifically or biologically proven.
8820 2018-12-16 19:53:09 I'm afraid this I DO know something about and (respectfully! ) that may have been a small part of it. Mostly it was : countering Iran ( Iraq led a war against them ) , oil, arms sales. And here in uk we were just as complicit. Even after hallabjah.
8821 2018-12-16 19:53:07 이제 상대방이 무슨 행동을 싫어할지 눈치를 채도 걍 한다 그게 나 다운거니까

8824 2018-12-16 19:52:52 who wants to go with me to get this oil change? 
8825 2018-12-16 19:52:45 This looks like an oil painting

8827 2018-12-16 19:52:39 Mine tends to dislike it when I run low (ish) on water. 
When low on petrol.
 Oh and once when I didn’t have any gear box oil for a long time 
8828 2018-12-16 19:52:33 Your lies will be exposed soon enough. People will remember who sold them the snake oil. 
 It is because our tax money through subsides! Prior to subsidee you didn't have many turbines going up. Why? Because it was never profitable! Big tax scam!!

8830 2018-12-16 19:52:29 Melatonin baby. And we ain’t got none! I’m glow in the dark melatonin deficient and grew up on the coast in the baby oil and iodine suntanning with lemon juice in your hair craze. It’s a freaking miracle I didn’t look like a Shar-Pei by 17 I burn wearing 75 spf 
8831 2018-12-16 19:52:19 I bought cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, guac, chicken, pico de gallo, avocado oil and some how I better magically make this an amazing meal. So I can meal prep for the week. Adulting.
8832 2018-12-16 19:52:18 Oil!
8833 2018-12-16 19:52:01 White people love to fetishize indigenous people but arent supporting/protecting the waters or stopping oil pipelines w/ us
8834 2018-12-16 19:52:00 No, I won't loose my home training
8835 2018-12-16 19:51:48 If you’re saying that ‘Corbynomics’ has worked around the world, then yes, social democracy has, in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Spot the commonalities there. Oh, and Norway, which didn’t spunk its oil wealth away and is 1/10th of the size of U.K.
8836 2018-12-16 19:51:47 your oil tho 
8837 2018-12-16 19:51:47 사람한테 비위 맞추기 이제 귀찮아서 안해
8838 2018-12-16 19:51:34 My heating oil is on automatic delivery. Getting a delivery now. Sunday afternoon. #thankful for those who work weekends.

8840 2018-12-16 19:51:23 I think talks are going on. ExxonMobil is coming to explore oil in sea. Strong possibility of huge oil in the sea. Rekodik is also discussed but it will take time. It is not like the previous govts to sign in hurry so that they fill their pockets but the agreement is full ofFlaws
8841 2018-12-16 19:51:23 Yeah, take power back, separate. Be independent.  Dig all the oil out of the ground. Go hard.  

But you should stop reading fairytales cause magic beans and Alberta’s access to coastal waters are make believe.

8844 2018-12-16 19:51:15 We should do everything we can to transition rapidly to renewables. While  Canadians are using oil and gas, let's buy Canadian.
8845 2018-12-16 19:51:15 Things have been different since I read the book “broken jars still carry oil”. Some important chains were broken. I feel freer than ever. #jars
8846 2018-12-16 19:51:12 Where would you like CO2 levels to be?    World wide there are 100"s of new coal plants being built?  Why is China not included?  Why are climate scientists not pushing nuclear if they are really serious? What shut in oil sands and not US oil?

8850 2018-12-16 19:50:42 How is it that the US has increased oil and gas production, yet is the only country to show a substantial reduction in emissions? Explain!

8853 2018-12-16 19:50:14 Castor oil that’s all I’ve used for years 
It’s super strange I usually never breakout THIS bad
8854 2018-12-16 19:50:03 It's like their trying to be sneaky about it. Kinda like "what ever are you talking about, what is oil" then they run away. Yet at the same time, everyone knows they are buying dictator oil.

8857 2018-12-16 19:49:46 In what way, shape or form does your declaration clarify your position vis a vis my comment?  Go on, make a clear statement ref the removal of Turkey’s occupying troops and the National Guard. Your position is at best a celebration of wishy-washy vagueness. Ridiculous.
8858 2018-12-16 19:49:44 My Anderson arms w/ rf85 had been great! Never need to oil it. Great if you are looking for something that might get dirty in a truck etc.
8859 2018-12-16 19:49:38 Yeah I've smoked it a few times. Not the oil, but the weed. It completely relaxes your whole body. Like a body high. Not the same feeling as  THC.

8864 2018-12-16 19:49:02 After listening to this eliminate oil & gas concept, I think we might have it slightly wrong. Maybe the Globalists want total control of all oil & gas for themselves. If our oil starts flowing Canada could get too powerful on the world stage. Just thinking

8869 2018-12-16 19:48:38 Ann focus on who and why we fight pointless wars. Oil, petrol dollar, drugs. Our leaders have been corrupt on all of this.

8871 2018-12-16 19:48:20 If the USA is going to tax its allies to fund our national security's, they should be expected to stop buying middle eastern oil too.

8873 2018-12-16 19:48:15 Ya Saudi oil is going to Irving in New Brunswick which is so much better!
The cherry on top is that it's then exported as gasoline to Quebec with most of it going to the US! So much better!
SMH....

8894 2018-12-16 19:46:21 Better yet, commandeer the ship, give the crew a huge salary with Canadian citizenships, and use the ship for Canadian oil.
8895 2018-12-16 19:46:19 Fossil fuels aren't going to last forever shale gas and other tight oils are expensive to extract and a symptom of peak oil rather than the cure.  As the article says energy transitions take a long time but that doesn't mean oil will last forever.

Is that how he is repaying Putin for his help?
8900 2018-12-16 19:45:41 I definitely need a oil change before I leave out of town this weekend @Shawn

8904 2018-12-16 19:44:57 In addition, Iran and Saudi Arabia compete for the leadership of Islam.  They also compete for leadership in the international oil market, especially since Venezuela is a basket case.

Unfortunately for Islam in general and for Jihadis in particular, the oil price is weak.

8907 2018-12-16 19:44:32 The first crayons were made from a mixture of charcoal and oil. Later, powdered pigments of various hues replaced the charcoal. It was discovered that substituting wax for the oil in the mixture made the sticks sturdier and easier to handle. 
8908 2018-12-16 19:44:24 YEAH, TRY CHANGING YOUR CARS OIL, WHEN THERE'S NO OIL TO BE HAD! AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FILTER!
8909 2018-12-16 19:44:20 CBD oil has been very helpful for me. Usually I’ll try to feed myself crackers or toast very slowly. If I can keep down liquids I’ll have lots of water or tea. Pedialyte helps too. Just being very gentle and patient with myself. Good luck and feel better!
8910 2018-12-16 19:44:17 I bet a mom on FB has the perfect essential oil for that
8911 2018-12-16 19:43:46 First the earth cooled. Then the dinosaurs came. They got to big and fat and then they died and turned into oil. And then the Arabs came, and they all bought Mercedes Benzes. Then Prince Charles started wearing all lady Di's clothing. He took her best dress out and put it on.
8912 2018-12-16 19:43:45 Thanks for the time pointless time waste but I'm bored now and would rather return to plating with the cat or putting my hand in boiling oil.
8913 2018-12-16 19:43:37 I would agree with your forecast, but I claim no special competence in birds' entrails. If oil is a barometer, it's a bad one, as the chart in my post shows!
8914 2018-12-16 19:43:29 Olive Oil I Never Call
8915 2018-12-16 19:43:28 “Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty.” — Pope Francis, addressing oil executives at the Vatican
8916 2018-12-16 19:43:25 (Sigh) It is dangerously scary because it mortgages future generations to take care of the current one. If oil dries up or if the EU begins to get energy from someplace else, then the main driver of their economy disappears. How do you fund these social programs then?
8917 2018-12-16 19:43:15 o woah i didnt know u could just use oil to clean ur self but thats cool. we r like cast iron skillets.
8918 2018-12-16 19:43:04 You’re not factoring in the billions given to oil companies. You know. The ones responsible for your problems.
8919 2018-12-16 19:42:39 You don’t think she . . . was actually . . .refilling with tea rather than oil ?

8921 2018-12-16 19:42:30 Cuomo and Kellyanne go together like oil and water. Separately, they're okay but together they don't mix well.
8922 2018-12-16 19:42:23 @IcelandFoods Palm fat is the Same as Palm oil!  So what's with the phoney PR position?
8923 2018-12-16 19:42:21 Venezuela use to be a rich country with all their oil now that money goes to a few and the country dies the democratics want socialism to come to America
8924 2018-12-16 19:42:14 oil dissolves makeup, so u just massage the oil into ur skin then wash it off with warm water (& a washcloth that u don’t mind getting makeup-stained). hemp seed doesn’t clog ur pores so it’s good for oily or sensitive skin
8925 2018-12-16 19:42:09 That cleansing oil is my holy grail
8926 2018-12-16 19:41:54 انت لو تترك عنك موضوع خاشقي الي خشرت نفسك فيه ابرك لك صار حسابك ممل جدا انا مواطنة سعودية وأؤيد قتل خاشقجي الخائن الي لو عاش يوم واحد خرب لنا بلدنا انت كمغربي وش دخلك الا ان كانك تبغي لنا خراب الديار وانت تتظاهر انك مكرز بالمحبة والخلاص!
8927 2018-12-16 19:41:43 Alberta still has to plan too because all those same workers abandon ship every time the price of oil dips so we can't exactly rely on it for budgeting

and yet we do regardless of who is steering the ship god I hate this fucking province
8928 2018-12-16 19:41:25 why the dried seaweed just nut oil in my mouth
8929 2018-12-16 19:41:24 My recollection is that they refused to sell their oil to us; we simply bought elsewhere.  We used our clout to enact a worldwide UN ban on ANY trade with Iraq for 13 years; that's a true embargo. This was one of bin Laden's 3 reasons for 9-11.

8932 2018-12-16 19:41:17 WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE TO KNOW HOW MANY LITERS OF WATER CAN BE POISONOUS BC OF ONE DROP OF OIL
WHY DO I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE MAKING YOU ADDICTED
WHY DO I HAVE TO KNOW THIS SHIT 
 CAN SOMEBODY PLS SLAM MY HEAD AGAINST THE FUCKING WALL
8933 2018-12-16 19:41:00 You are dumb as you confused income with expenditure and bring similar statistic on earning from crude oil. What the FM release in figures is quite different from the actual expenditure.
8934 2018-12-16 19:40:59 Zinke’s Likely Successor Is a Former Oil Lobbyist Who Has Influenced Trump’s Energy Policy ... so as you can see, the bottom of the barrel has yet to be reached
8935 2018-12-16 19:40:49 And that to get to these numbers, we're not talking about corporation and PACs, but individual donations and the occupations/employers they list on the disclosure form.

This is how you get to "BETO TOOK MONEY FROM BIG OIL" smears. (Note: I haven't endorsed *any* 2020 candidate.)
8936 2018-12-16 19:40:43 Double digits, she needs a oil change & some new tires
8937 2018-12-16 19:40:43 Will not buy anything that uses palm oil. No exceptions.
8938 2018-12-16 19:40:41 "Oh Lord, Please give us another oil boom, we promise we won't piss it away like the last one."

The Alberta Prayer. Said every bust since '82.

Our current woes are not the Fed's fault. They are ours, for pissing away every boom we have ever had,  and leaving our cupboard bare.

8942 2018-12-16 19:40:18 2/ For example, taking corn to $200/bushel & oil to $10,000 per barrel would starve billions to death & collapse global supply chains.  Gold's attraction is that "it isn't used for anything", so it can be inflated as much as needed to re-collateralize the system.
8943 2018-12-16 19:40:13 Dude don’t show a 2017 graphic the world export maket changes monthly I buy/sell oil from that refinery and many more in N.America. Haha love how you kids get in the internet and send dated graphics trying to spin it like your an oil/products trading expert.

8945 2018-12-16 19:39:58 Prepping a 7 lb. standing prime rib to smoke. Rubbed with a baste of olive oil, freshly minced garlic, black pepper & sea salt.
8946 2018-12-16 19:39:55 That oil had me on my ass last night
8947 2018-12-16 19:39:45 Well, the contrast between city and country is more or less universal. I think it's more about difference in culture, whether you carry motor oil on your boots or cowpat, having book learning or being hands-on (imputed contrast, not real, I know).
8948 2018-12-16 19:39:41 I just passed a Five Guys and there were literally BOXES UPON BOXES of peanut oil. Steer clear of Five Guys
8949 2018-12-16 19:39:39 how do u wash ur face with an oil
8950 2018-12-16 19:39:34 The people of planet earth should do at least this? be a good example! for leaders such as presidents congress people and senators this means be for world peace NOT war! be for banning nukes bombs and missiles be for green energy NOT oil, coal and fracking! be for medicare 4 all
8951 2018-12-16 19:39:24 Oil majors should relocate their headquaters to porthacut.
8952 2018-12-16 19:39:04 Issued licence for refineries during OBJ administration did not see the light of the day.

Most of these guys own refineries abroad and would take crude oil for a refined product.

Private investors prefer to play when the downstream sector is deregulated fully.
8953 2018-12-16 19:38:40 Mourinho the buying coach. Was top notch before oil money sugar daddies. Now bang average
8954 2018-12-16 19:38:28 This is the single most terrifying thing you’ve said yet. You think the government which under both parties has been far too friendly with big oil is now run by lefty scientists? The government is realizing climate change is economically perilous. That’s what’s happening.
8955 2018-12-16 19:38:25 I will days to review this.   I will approach with an open mind. Let's assume you are right. You still have answered zero questions wrt to Vivian Krause and tar sands campaign.   Why only Canada's resource? How does stopping Canada's oil impact emissions.
8956 2018-12-16 19:38:15 thanl@u!! i get them every now n the i think bc the oil from my hair!
8957 2018-12-16 19:37:50 When we moved into our first house, “elders” prayed over the place and put oil over the doorposts. I imagined “spirit realm activity” that night. I wonder why....
8958 2018-12-16 19:37:45 میرے خیال سے یہ دونوں اچھے نہیں ہیں صحیت کے لئے ۔
Any item with oil fare not will for helth
8959 2018-12-16 19:37:44 Throwing leftover rotisserie chicken in a pan with some olive oil produces a decent approximation of shawarma.
8960 2018-12-16 19:37:13 I’m coming off this oil and just mad
8961 2018-12-16 19:37:12 Got any vegetable oil? 
8962 2018-12-16 19:36:50 I guess all the tankers full of crude oil in the St Lawrence are just taking a detour????
8963 2018-12-16 19:36:38 URGENT GLOBAL QUESTION: What has happened to Kettle Chips? They're now no better than a Walkers or, dare I say it, a Tyrrells... Weird oil, no skin and hardly any salt. ARGGGH.

8964 2018-12-16 19:36:35 I am so glad I bought my peppermint oil.  This sinus headache is trying to creep up but NO! Lol
8965 2018-12-16 19:36:35 Yet illegal immigration is at a 40 year low. Typical trump create a problem and sell a solution. Snake oil salesmen
8966 2018-12-16 19:36:33 I swear I envy women like you. My nigga cheated on me 5x and I took him back every time because who’s going to change my car oil , sis ? Who 
8967 2018-12-16 19:36:17 the problem is "it should be", even adding the oil I barely reach 1200 calories.
8968 2018-12-16 19:36:14 exfoliate every other day at the end of your wash routine & bio oil! i use the indian clay mask to minimize & clear my pores once a week
8969 2018-12-16 19:35:59 Idk why ppl fall for the super expensive itworks “skinny coffee” .... bulletproof coffee is just coffee, grass fed butter and oil that’s literally it, you don’t need to order it from there and support yh weird Ponzi scheme
8970 2018-12-16 19:35:44 May... may have had a @BeavertownBeer Gamma @HOS_Tynemouth and then maybe a Neck Oil at the Turks... maybe 
8971 2018-12-16 19:35:36 So you use oil instead of brick, mortar and you will still need contractors. There is a reason the current building materials are used, it is because they are the cheapest bang for the buck. You want more homes built, don't make them more expensive.
8972 2018-12-16 19:35:23 Try some CBD oil
8973 2018-12-16 19:35:11 But, if oil prices fall, the fall in the import price deflator should be compensated by the fall in value of imports, no ?
8974 2018-12-16 19:35:07 Wuqarka akwai kayfi
8975 2018-12-16 19:34:55 Those are the cold hard facts Helgard. They won’t just enter a sovereign nation to protect white people who suppressed others human rights for decades. If SA had oil maybe it would have been different. There is not even a US military base in SA to protect.
8976 2018-12-16 19:34:47 Nothing breaks your heart more than an oil stain on a brand new sweater

8981 2018-12-16 19:34:14 @alikqvc 
My lovely christmas present was a set of windscreen wipers and tin of oil very romantic
8982 2018-12-16 19:34:11 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Norway is a large energy producer, and one of the world's largest exporters of oil. Most of the electricity in the country is produced by hydroelectricity.

Produz energia limpa, exporta energia suja: Um grande negocio!
8983 2018-12-16 19:33:56 Beto took 29 large donations of over $200 from OIL EVECUTIVES, so no they weren’t just from employees dipshit. He violated the “No Fossil Fuel $” pledge he took. But who cares right? 
8984 2018-12-16 19:33:46 They get a large % of their oil from NB. Come in man.
8985 2018-12-16 19:33:41 Try again .....Irving refinery gets 100% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, United States & Nigeria none from AB. We export 99% of our oil Canada makes up over 45% of US imports at a 30%+ discount to the benchmark index due to lack of pipelines: thanks Quebec/Vancouver lose billlions
8986 2018-12-16 19:33:34 maybe an essential oil diffuser? those are popular now. me and anna always get people nice insulated mugs too and put those sheet face masks in them. or maybe a donation to a charity she likes
8987 2018-12-16 19:33:24 For those who have traded the oil market long enough and are looking to get long, remember..... “the oil market always overshoots”
8988 2018-12-16 19:33:12 Just caught a lady spraying different scents of Axe in the air to test them out as if they all don’t smell like a combination of Pine-Sol and motor oil
8989 2018-12-16 19:33:03 The solution is simpler - set neutral reserve asset (say gold) & then keep oil stable relative to gold...ie IMF says "Gold is now valued at 400 bbls per oz."  Each nation can then choose how to value gold in its currency based on its energy needs/policies.
8990 2018-12-16 19:32:50 There cannot be a physical delivery of the disease like oil or gold if the contract buyer wishes.
8991 2018-12-16 19:32:45 กอดแน่นๆเลยคะ หัวใจมีแต่แผล
8992 2018-12-16 19:32:41 You can go ahead a d manufacture the cooking oil yourself since the currency that you made is already in circulation.. Bond noted
8993 2018-12-16 19:32:33 What is a Prospect?

A Prospect is a serious Student, who is also a gifted athlete, w/ ability & desire to play WBB (College Basketball).

I'm not searching to fill another Rec program.

Rec Players & Prospects are really like Oil & Vinegar.
They don't mix well.
Different goals.
8994 2018-12-16 19:32:27 Which is why we should stop deploying innocent people to wage for-profit wars on behalf of offense contractors and oil companies.
8995 2018-12-16 19:32:21 Wanted to buy Cantu daily oil for dry hair and it's selling point was "made with natural shea butter". I already have shea butter and I see a difference in my hair, why pay more for a product?
8996 2018-12-16 19:32:16 It appears I didn't purchase oil pastels on amazon, but SOFT PASTELS, which are entirely different. ... But i'mma play with this stuff anyway and watch youtube tutorials. YEAH.

9000 2018-12-16 19:31:24 Isnt it nasty?! You can be the cleanest person and still catch lice. Truly black people or anyone with thick, more naturally greasy hair have the advantage against never catching them. Thats why they put oil or mayonnaise in your hair when you do bc it suffocates them to death
9001 2018-12-16 19:31:14 CBD oil is supposed to be a wonderful, natural anti inflammatory.
9002 2018-12-16 19:31:14 I went into the health store to reup on oil of oregano, I came out with a new diffuser and a bunch of supplements i’ve been researching
9003 2018-12-16 19:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and open borders.
9004 2018-12-16 19:31:05 @petedavidsonSNL -One way, Start feeding it nature’s simple fresh organic fruits and vegetables, whole grains, organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil, fresh herbs, it will tell you how happy it is!  2/
9005 2018-12-16 19:31:04 Turkey legs. Rub with olive oil and Greek gyros mix (under the skin as well). As many as you need, or as many as your oven will fit. You can stick heads of garlic to roast in foil packets on the sides.. Smells heavenly.
9006 2018-12-16 19:31:04 Are those your oil leaks?? LOL
9007 2018-12-16 19:30:43 I moisturized my face w/coconut oil today. Hm.

9009 2018-12-16 19:30:32 Melania Trump complaining about “opportunists” is like the CEO of an oil complaining complaining about climate change. If she hadn’t married a fat, old “rich” C-list celebrity, she’d be picking beets for 40 cents an hour in Eastern Europe.

9011 2018-12-16 19:30:20 I think you’re missing the point, there, sir. If they’re getting oil from a country other than their own, that’s an issue. When there’s abundant supply and your province reaps the benefits of said oil, why would you not purchase that product? How do you not see that???
9012 2018-12-16 19:30:09 That 2000 Election was Bush vs. Gore. (Oil vs. Climate). The Supreme Court chose oil and we lost all those years to in action. @realDonaldTrump is in bed with Russia and Saudi Arabia for the same reason Oil. I've run 4 times on Climate Change since 2004. We need support to win.
9013 2018-12-16 19:29:34 It's my understanding that refineries in NB who are supplied by Saudi oil sell their product in Quebec. Does that count?
9014 2018-12-16 19:29:26 Yo offset crashing cardi’s show is so dead. That is not cute, I’d be pissed

9019 2018-12-16 19:29:00 You win the nonsense tweet the day. Imagine any government saying you can only buy PEI potatoes or Ontario cars  or BC wine etc. BTW are you old enough to remember “let those eastern bastards freeze in the dark!”? And you expect those same easterners to be dependent on Alta oil?
9020 2018-12-16 19:28:56 Sautéed sprouts in toasted sesame oil, then into an omelet. Heaven! #sprouts
9021 2018-12-16 19:28:50 I'm sure the same activists who are against Energy East would be similarly against a pipeline that, for example, would bring Texas oil through Quebec.
9022 2018-12-16 19:28:50 It's so lush. I make this all the time. Its my easy cheat dinner. Biona gnocchi, pref pumpkin but plain is OK too. Tin cherry Tom's, tin chopped Tom's, jar of roasted pepper, if in oil drizzle all with some oil, add gnocchi & any herbs or anything you like. Cheese, saus, veg. X
9023 2018-12-16 19:28:48 Get your facts straight... The majority of Suncors (which owns 68% of Syncrude) oil is refined in Alberta and sold as West Texas Intermediate. It’s mainly the smaller SAGD projects that produce “WCS”.
9024 2018-12-16 19:28:36 Bullshit... Obama's GDP growth was a pathetic 1.5%.. Trump is nearly 4%. Obama's economy was carried by big oil, new drilling techniques and fracking.  The top jobs states were GOP led with TX leading the way.. Obama DOUBLED the deficit with his failed stimulus and others.
9025 2018-12-16 19:28:31 Love these krisprolls. I’d like to know whether the palm oil is sourced responsibly too.
9026 2018-12-16 19:28:29 Try to concentrate on your countries affairs,  just leave Uganda to Ugandans,  we actually know your target.. Oil while destabilizing Africa.. We are fully awake,  we shall fight you accordingly.

9030 2018-12-16 19:28:15 it should be around 1700 I think, the plan also takes in account 16 g of olive oil every day, but I almost never use them.

9036 2018-12-16 19:27:33 I went thru menopause drug free. Took Primrose Oil only and just toughed it out. Do not use Premarin. It is made from urine of impregnated mares who never ever set foot outside. Their foals are destroyed at birth. Horrible business.
9037 2018-12-16 19:27:33 Doggy pot. Sounds crazy but maybe a bit of CBD oil will help relax her. They have treat infused ones.
9038 2018-12-16 19:27:24 If only we had some sort of national program for energy that ensured we used Canadian oil and set prices.
9039 2018-12-16 19:27:24 Ummmm??? Under the Trump admin, we just became self reliant in oil. Also, in case you missed it, "We have the gold" #Qanon

9042 2018-12-16 19:26:56 We have empowered Denis Coderre into a anti oil radical
9043 2018-12-16 19:26:56 Maybe? It's pretty much manioc flour, milk, oil, salt, and shredded cheese (we lean heavy on parmesan  because that's what the friend who gave us the recipe uses)?
9044 2018-12-16 19:26:37 We are diversified & should be more so without Energy. Mining is unique & native to Canada. Energy is being & can be replaced by many more environmentally friendly renewable resources industries. Energy(oil & gas) are dinosaur industries from the last century.
9045 2018-12-16 19:26:27 Somewhere I read that Tilly took the job entirely/only to seal some deal with Putin - and put his hefty-a**  in the running for (sitting down??) 9 figures worth of oil business
9046 2018-12-16 19:26:17 I wish, however paper ballots are more difficult to cheat votes on.
9047 2018-12-16 19:26:09 Saudi Arabia not to charge ‘On-Time Delivery Premium charges’ on Crude Oil. Thus saved the country thousands of crores.

India could get additional supplies of Uranium from Australia for its energy production.

There r many benefits but 4 ur info the aforementioned r enough
9048 2018-12-16 19:25:58 Yes, he's too narrowly focused on improving the material conditions of the working class. He should broaden his horizons and support a war with Iran or prop up oil & gas interests.
9049 2018-12-16 19:25:56 I am very concerned what is going on senators who are not Natives, involved in tribal lands  "protections" and to business with oil productions too.
9050 2018-12-16 19:25:48 Alberta is effectively buying Saudi oil for Quebec.
9051 2018-12-16 19:25:46 My mum ordered gluten free chips the other week, when they brought them out they said they had been cooked in the same oil as the regular ones. When she complained they took the chips but didn't bring a replacement or refund her money

9056 2018-12-16 19:25:22 Too risky!  LMFAO!  Is sending oil in a tanker across the ocean less risk (Exxon Valdez)? Is sending it via train less risky (Lac Magentic)? It’s in the damn ground in a steel pipe! There is no safer way.  You people are deluded!!!
9057 2018-12-16 19:25:21 @patsnsox123 , did you do any fact checking on that meme you posted with your Tweet?
Did Beto take money from an Oil PAC, or an oil Corp, such as Texaco, or Shell?
Just wondering.

9061 2018-12-16 19:25:09 naw cause i pulled in & im like “it look like a oil stain” just there 
9062 2018-12-16 19:24:59 Oh oh...indien we niet willen aangeven dat de rest vd wereld het Niet Wil of geen geld ervoor heeft..dan Blame Oil..tsjonge tsjonge wat is dit nog weer stoer. COP is doodgewoon mislukt omdat wereld slimmer is dan Idioten in NL.
9063 2018-12-16 19:24:43 If refineries can’t get oil delivered from Alberta, who else can they buy from!

The government merely controls the method of shipping and spent 4.8 billion of our tax dollars just to prevent Alberta from shipping oil!

2019
End The Madness
9064 2018-12-16 19:24:37 Many Albertans inflate the importance of Alberta oil and gas within the Canadian economy, but o/g only make up 10% of Canada's national GDP, and Alberta is not the only province who mines o/g. Alberta does put emphasis on o/g, and Albertans cry 'recession' every time prices slump

9071 2018-12-16 19:23:34 Yeah it was my first time making a roast on my own, splashed a bunch of hot oil on myself peeping things 
9072 2018-12-16 19:23:27 It is too late: for uneconomic, environmentally destructive tar sands development. When will oilbertans get your shit together and realize the industry has moved on? You squandered oil windfall instead of investing in diversification. Blame Trudeau, but only Canada will save you.
9073 2018-12-16 19:23:14 Also the slogan of the Saudis who funded the 9/11 hijackers. A pox on all your houses–the sooner we spin down oil & gas production, the better. Your petroleum wealth allows you to live beyond your means, but it won’t last forever.

9075 2018-12-16 19:23:11 I slipped on oil in Bjs in front of a table of fine ass men. How’s your day going ? 
9076 2018-12-16 19:23:06 I believe 81% of the oil QC consumes is from USA ...Not Alberta.
9077 2018-12-16 19:23:00 lrt as a stem major, honestly the highest paying job i could get in industry as a chemical engineer is a 6 digit starting salary if i go into the oil industry
9078 2018-12-16 19:22:59 Sooooooo this ninja was really gonna force feed his dog charcoal that you use on the grill because he thought the Dog got into some oil and he knows they use charcoal to clean your system.... I kept him from doing it but WTF
9079 2018-12-16 19:22:40 Tried that last year. Tasted terrible. I wouldn’t do it again but I definitely wouldn’t use peanut oil unless you like prime rib that tastes like peanuts.
9080 2018-12-16 19:22:30 You have no chance of winning a second Indy vote. When all of the billions of pounds worth of oil tax revenues didn’t materialise

Lemon juice

I don't get my wings. I first cook them on the pan without oil then transfer to the oven Cc @julleberry
9082 2018-12-16 19:22:23 Then we wonder why Zimbabweans don’t have a currency, why they can’t manufacture cooking oil or why we consume more than we produce with people who think like you?
9083 2018-12-16 19:22:10 I am going to do that..I did it for Tool ...so will do it for myself....
Good idea.
9084 2018-12-16 19:22:07 Noo...
Oil and energy related.
9085 2018-12-16 19:22:03 Replace the vegetable oil in the brownie mix with Blood Orange Olive Oil for some of the tastiest brownies ever! 
9086 2018-12-16 19:21:58 For 99% of B2B startups there are only two cities for which "relocate to ______" makes sense: SF/Bay and New York (incl. its more live-able suburb, my hometown of Boston).  There are a few other edge cases like Houston for oil industry, Seattle for MSFT-focused tech etc.
9087 2018-12-16 19:21:58 The colour of inanimate objects is not racist or we would not call oil black gold!
9088 2018-12-16 19:21:57 @LanceSnacks I have an important question so I hope you can respond soon, but is the palm oil used from sustainable sources? I'm a frequent customer and finally noticed it now and it's upsetting.
9089 2018-12-16 19:21:54 When you give a fuckboi a chance  and he ends up breaking your heart.
9090 2018-12-16 19:21:48 If you’re going to take them, a decent multi and/or omega-3(dha/epa)...try to find one not fish oil based, as that derivative is become more and more toxic
9091 2018-12-16 19:21:46 Jerry must of spent some of that oil money!!!
9092 2018-12-16 19:21:41 If only more of us could see objectively from all angles. Great breakdown and coverage of multiple interests. It made me think twice about my opinion on matter. I'm still pro-P/L. If all oil produced was shown on emission severity index, why is only AB oil on the chopping block?
9093 2018-12-16 19:21:41 3) Norway's oil is all off shore and just as expensive to extract as AB.
9094 2018-12-16 19:21:39 Olive oil is so fucking expensive and if there’s anything about being an adult that makes me mad, it’s that.
9095 2018-12-16 19:21:39 Pointing out that Quebec gets a lot of oil from Alberta from the Line 9 reversal doesn’t do much to silence the charge that they are being hypocrites for saying there’s no social acceptability for Alberta oil in that Province. Clearly there must be.
9096 2018-12-16 19:21:36 Midnight Oil volta pra cá ano que vem?
9097 2018-12-16 19:21:34 Saudi oil, no good. Iraqi oil no good,Venezuelan oil, no good. U.S. oil, no good. Canadian oil very good! There isn't much flowing to Quebec and points east because the Liberals have screwed up the pipeline file so badly !  Voters, kick their asses to the curb !! #cdnpoli #onpoli
9098 2018-12-16 19:21:34 Love being covered in oil.

9112 2018-12-16 19:20:11 Pipelines and no more handcuffs. The oil patch has never asked for bailouts. Very simple, not simple enough for our current federal and provincial governments to understand apparently.
9113 2018-12-16 19:20:10 According to world/oil-and-gasoline-fast-facts/index.html   Jan 2018, USA surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil production. So, if the US continues with its efficiency run in shale oil production in addition to their conventional production, projections below will be reality.
9114 2018-12-16 19:20:08 These refs in Lucas Oil man.
9115 2018-12-16 19:19:49 I heartedly agree with you, you are right and my apology to u. Just feel glad she is joining the dems.

9117 2018-12-16 19:19:47 ... Due to a drop in oil prices. Not based on what was reality at the time. Westminster currently taking us though brexit despite every single forecast showing catastrophe, even their own, is that competent? 800 page white paper versus a big red bus 
9118 2018-12-16 19:19:45 Fusion energy will crush oil soon Oil is in the past and to cut Putin’s throat Green energy is a national security issue Russians have nothing but hookers and Vodka that’s not much economic stability to support his thugryyPutin will fall Green energy revolution will take over

9121 2018-12-16 19:19:11 I guess that explains why oil is $11/bbl instead of 70

9123 2018-12-16 19:19:01 Many Albertans play off political trends from the US, and so libertarianism and xenophobia play well here. Some Albertans think carbon tax is meant to attack the oil industry. Growing up in Calgary, working in oil and gas was a sort of right of passage. Of course it's hype....

9127 2018-12-16 19:18:43 Yeah taking out the p2w is good, but leaving the prompts In the pressure people to buy gold only to not be able to use it is something that we should never see in games.

That's a God damn snake oil salesman
9128 2018-12-16 19:18:39 I think you may be spot on with that as it was busy and this particular piece was dripping in oil too which I think signifies they quickly just removed it from the fryer. 
More haste less speed I think the saying is
9129 2018-12-16 19:18:27 Woke up feeling semi hungover so I hit the CBD oil and now I feel like fifty bucks. That shit works sometimes.
9130 2018-12-16 19:18:26 And alot of that will be pam oil

9133 2018-12-16 19:18:15 The government doesn't tell to the oil refineries where to buy their oil from....so you propose to nationalize the oil industry?
9134 2018-12-16 19:17:55 Here is an idea why not build refining capacity here instead of relying so much on others oil. We ship out for them to refine then buy back, makes no sense.
9135 2018-12-16 19:17:48 Why does @JustinTrudeau support Saudi blood oil instead Alberta oil?  Build a gawdamn pipeline already!!!

9139 2018-12-16 19:17:34 Lets face facts President Trump is going to do what the big oil companies want and doesn't care about the environment
9140 2018-12-16 19:17:15 The oil price shock gave us distributive quarrel leading to inflation. The credit crunch gave us universal credit, homelessness and food banks. Irresponsible to ask people to suffer. The poor carry the greater burden.
9141 2018-12-16 19:17:11 I beg to differ. Now the public is better informed than they were in 2016 when listening to the snake oil salesmen, they need a binary choice-a no-deal Brexit v Remain
9142 2018-12-16 19:17:05 Why do you support Saudi blood oil instead Alberta oil?  Build a gawdamn pipeline already!!!
9143 2018-12-16 19:17:01 Not true Brett as Ontario’s #RingofFire Chromite deposit could create great jobs building stainless steel pipelines for oil and gas from the west @KWGresources could process the Ferrochrome to feed the stainless steel industry.
9144 2018-12-16 19:16:58 Yes! These guys are snake oil salesmen preying on the weak and the naive. Will be a “special place” in hell for them.

For all we know, you could be faking your location...
9147 2018-12-16 19:16:51 Lies, damned lies, and statistics. Lots of QC gets oil refined by the Irving's in NB. Guess where that oil comes from. Saudi, Libya, Russia, etc. Between 22-25% of all imports goes from these dodgy places. And those imports aren't going to ON and West. They are servicing QC East

Do I pass inspection?
9156 2018-12-16 19:15:25 Drop a few drops of either lavender oil or peppermint oil into a warm bath and soak. Essential oils are the shit, always works for me. If not there’s always an epsom salt bath.
9157 2018-12-16 19:15:12 So they’re pro pipeline but they’re against the globalist world order? Who do they think is going to buy the oil if they get the pipelines built? I’m confused.
9158 2018-12-16 19:15:04 Trudeau is a puppet of the globalist agenda which is to eliminate the Oil and Gas industry , import poverty , destroy the middle class ... he’s doing a great job at it !

9182 2018-12-16 19:12:30 Why would Quebec allow tankers from the US and Algeria for their oil and not pipelines from Alberta and Saskatchewan? Why also is Trudeau giving Quebec 13 billion dollars of deficit spending this year? No wonder their liquor taxes are the lowest in the country.
9183 2018-12-16 19:12:20 Yes I always try it when I feel like having instant  cooked food by adding  garlic paste,mozzarella  cheese with olive oil and some spices.

9186 2018-12-16 19:12:03 Since I'm currently lying on my bed feeling as if I can't get up, I'm going to just take my oil drops for my wax filled ear. Then that way I know it'll definitely be done before I actually do fall into a deep/profound sleep later.

I have no respect for the politicians who tricked people into thinking wars for money and oil were really for freedom
9190 2018-12-16 19:11:32 We're gonna build a swamp and fill it with oil. We will appoint some trophy hunters to deal with the animals. We're gonna take your public lands and sell them to oil drillers and miners. We're gonna log the forests and pollute the rivers. MAGA.
9191 2018-12-16 19:11:24 G-give me the oil mommy
9192 2018-12-16 19:11:13 Exactly the same thing. However, I'm not the hypocrite going around expecting perfection, imagining that incremental progress is worse than none, and deifying a dualistic snake oil salesman.

9194 2018-12-16 19:10:51 They aren’t asking the government to pay for it they are going to pay for it. They just want to get approval. In Texas they found the biggest oil discovery in history just recently.

9200 2018-12-16 19:09:44 Oh gotcha. The plot point was that it was a hard freeze, and with the oil shortage and no heaters burning in the groves, they’d lose their crops. Citrus fruits are destroyed. So it was below 32° freezing, not just chilly.  I live down here and we freeze periodically!

9203 2018-12-16 19:09:04 @VinnieTortorich so if coconut oil is the best thing to cook in from a carb standpoint, why is coconut water so carby?  Or do I have it wrong.
9204 2018-12-16 19:09:02 The oil and gas can't Not afford to ignore the lies being spread about. 
Someone mentioned they took the high road. I agree. Bit they also don't take these jerks seriously I think and thought it would go away. When they clued in, then the vilification kicks in.
9205 2018-12-16 19:09:00 QC still imports a lot of foreign oil while blocking Cdn oil pipelines. It’s hypocritical considering the US is not part of the Paris Accord, they have no CO2 tax, QC does not do border adjustments, and they continue to receive eq payments largely funded by the West. Oh Canada!!

9208 2018-12-16 19:08:55 LMAO There is nothing wrong with a little whip now and then, the problem is your a Marine your use to eating in the field, unless its dry with a little gun oil and sand on your sandwich your just NOT happy.
9209 2018-12-16 19:08:55 ใครเหยียบตอน Oil press รอบต่ำอยู่เลข 6 กูไล่ลงจากรถเลย lol
9210 2018-12-16 19:08:52 You could DIY some! Coconut oil + shea butter works great, then some kind of wax to make it a balm texture (I just use coconut oil though) 
9211 2018-12-16 19:08:42 I like this simple orange ginger marinade: Mix orange juice, soy sauce, minced ginger and garlic, and olive oil. Pour over chicken in a zipper bag and marinate in fridge for a few hours. For a sweeter taste, add brown sugar.
9212 2018-12-16 19:08:06 My questions are how will that situation be improved under a Kenney govt? And is one term enough to evolve the political reality re the oil industry in Alberta?
9213 2018-12-16 19:07:56 Si se invento el monotributo para disminuir y unificar la carga impositiva en los oficios con ingresos promedio bajos....hasta el dueño de Denver Oil Company es monotribustista con un ingreso de 50000 pesos anuales....y declara un pozo de dos metros para sacar agua...
9214 2018-12-16 19:07:56 Hard cheese can also be covered in olive oil in a jar and kept that way! Delicious. I would recommend the Lidl Spanish olive oil for it too!
9215 2018-12-16 19:07:49 Who the fuck is paying for reclamation? Oh, right, the taxpayer. So you want me to sponge off the taxpayer so the oil industry doesn't have to clean up it's in messes? Is that your position here?
9216 2018-12-16 19:07:45 That scalability is one of the things they always overlook. People are like "well, look at Norway!" and I'm like "yeah, they have the population of Ohio and more oil than some OPEC nations."
9217 2018-12-16 19:07:34 With who? Joe Biden, who is a right winged Democrat creep? Beto who takes money from oil companies? The only person who is going to defeat Trump is Sanders and Gabbard. Don't expect people to vote blue no matter who if you are going to cheat... again!
9218 2018-12-16 19:07:13 Oil dey your head
9219 2018-12-16 19:07:10 Officials must have got some of Mr. Jones’s oil money before the game.
9220 2018-12-16 19:07:04 Let’s not look to far forward in your political career, for now just do the job you were voted into like fixing our roads & keeping the oil rigs off our coast
9221 2018-12-16 19:06:59 Bought some argan oil today so if my hair isn’t waist length by next summer I will demand a refund
9222 2018-12-16 19:06:56 Yeh , I swear they ain’t cooked in oil and in a frier
9223 2018-12-16 19:06:54 What does the fact colza,canola,rapeseed oil is now called different names in different cultures thanks to marketers have to do with GMO safety? Do you have 400 independent toxicology trials conducted by food agencies to demonstrate  HT Canola is safe for human nutrition?
9224 2018-12-16 19:06:49 BTW, coconut oil can quickly go rancid in shipment. Sunflower oil is not subject to such deteriation.
9225 2018-12-16 19:06:48 But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t want to do socialism like in Venezuela or the former Soviet union. She wants to do it like they do it in Norway where they have 4 million people sitting on top of vast reserves of oil.
9226 2018-12-16 19:06:24 @thameswater is there any way of reporting someone repeatedly pouring cooking oil/fat down a rd drain is it you or council who should deal with?

9233 2018-12-16 19:05:43 Fair comment. Got 30 hours in the Citabria which I did all my aeros training in, also flown Extra 200, XA42 and RV-7 upside down. To be honest we don’t even want to do stall turns in this just due to potential oil loss. Rolls and loops will probably be the extent of it.

9236 2018-12-16 19:05:31 he did, sort of. "“There is no social acceptance for a pipeline that would pass through Quebec territory,” Legault said."

guess it's okay for QC to use our "dirty" oil but not to pass it along to others.

hypocrite.

we again agree.
9237 2018-12-16 19:05:31 I hate that Republicans let oil and coal industry execs run our EPA. I hate that Republicans constantly cut taxes for millionaires and corporations that only use the money to buy back stock and not create jobs. I don't have patience for people that support an oligarchic agenda.
9238 2018-12-16 19:05:22 I saw a Phil Dorsett jersey at Lucas oil. A true asset for the patriots
9239 2018-12-16 19:05:21 Mr. Sowore should tell us another interesting story on job. Are you going to sack or kill all workers engaged in the services of NNPC or Oil Companies to create vacancies for job seekers? Even when the workers there are not sure of their job security because of low production?
9240 2018-12-16 19:05:07 Yep all of the 2 remaining Eastern refineries still imports oil from overseas.  Kinda weird when you consider that nfld offshore oil is sold abroad, and come by chance has to import from other sources.

9250 2018-12-16 19:04:17 And no, the data is not there. There is a wonderful bar graph showing the splitof foreign oil imports. And a lovely pie chart showing split of rype of oil (which bitumen is something like 5%). But nothin about the total consumption broken down by source. Even Stats Can omits it
9251 2018-12-16 19:03:57 Better jobs ??

9252 2018-12-16 19:03:48 Don’t see to Peter Lim. Valencia suck. Sell to the Saudi’s and bring this corrupted oil money in baybee.
9253 2018-12-16 19:03:44 this acclaimed recovery includes taxes, mtn fines and oil marketers but still it has not equal recurrent budge
9254 2018-12-16 19:03:38 Like I said, what they want and what is likely to unfold are two completely different things. If yields start to spike, they won't be able to cut and will be forced to raise. We've seen even with falling oil prices of almost 30%, inflation is still around the Fed's 2% target.

9260 2018-12-16 19:02:54 So I’ve been longing to give my hair some tlc all week but I can’t decide between a mask or a hot oil treatment 
9261 2018-12-16 19:02:50 i've done coconut oil, castor oil, almond oil and they're just ok.
9262 2018-12-16 19:02:38 Mom bought CBD oil and it smells like weed so she’s frantically trying to explain to cooper and I that it’s “not the bad stuff”

9266 2018-12-16 19:02:28 Trade ya jobs. You can work with some 20 year olds who think they are all that because they can do an oil change.
9267 2018-12-16 19:01:59 Line 9 from Montreal to Sarnia was reversed in 2016.  Virtually all offshore oil to the two Quebec refineries was replaced with western Canadian crude, upgraded product, and Bakkan shale oil.  Of course ol Jason and the gang never mention this.

9272 2018-12-16 19:01:16 We are going to have a HUGE trade on oil coming up - I think it's important to gather a list of names that you love the most when sector bounces ie: $OAS $WLL $SM $ESV whatever you fancy -- you'll be ready and familiar with a "go to" list. Compile that list today!
9273 2018-12-16 19:01:11 At least you recognise Remainers think #facts we can't change are important! UK's prosperity has a lot to do with our location, our character didn't give us North Sea oil & gas for starters. Means we import a lot of food too, through ports like Dover! #factsmatter #Brexit #FBPE

9284 2018-12-16 19:00:31 I read a stat that cited Energy Canada as a source, that said Quebec gets 80% of its oil from Canada and the US. I could find any information when I tried to google it though.

9287 2018-12-16 19:00:08 It simply raises a different question though. I thought the QC Prime Minister said there was no social accetibility for Alberta's dirty oil in QC. I'm having trouble keeping up with the narratives.

9292 2018-12-16 18:59:47 More tight oil & gas in the Bakken, 7 billion ppl, rapidly developing world...they'll go to the cheapest source... not subsidized wind and solar. We will indeed see.

9309 2018-12-16 18:57:50 Can’t believe your answers on pipeline Trudeau. You basically cancelled Energy East when it was proposed so don’t say there’s nothing on the table right now. You need to get Quebec onside and get off Saudi oil. Over 13 billion to Que and we get none?

9313 2018-12-16 18:57:45 Absolutely ridiculous.  Like I said on a tweet yesterday, it is Alberta oil, not Saudi oil that has financially supported Quebec.  When is the silent majority in this country going to stand up for what is right.
9314 2018-12-16 18:57:43 I kinda like the idea of EVs as the percentage of non-fossil energy increases on the grids.  When generated by coal & oil, kinda pointless, IMO.
But, they should be able to stand on their own, without being subsidized by tax payer's money.

I can't afford to buy one anyway.

9344 2018-12-16 18:54:22 Oil and vinegar child out of wedlock
9345 2018-12-16 18:54:20 Do they market it as Canadian oil?
9346 2018-12-16 18:54:04 Also, if the Irvings wished to purchase Canadian production, Hibernian oil would be a much less complicated option.
9347 2018-12-16 18:54:03 Indianapolis should be ASHAMED! Just as many Cowboys fans cheering as it is Colts fans. And the refs AIN'T gonna give us no calls against thr Cowboys.....not even at Lucas Oil Stadium.
9348 2018-12-16 18:53:58 so coconut oil doesn’t clog ur pores?
9349 2018-12-16 18:53:50 It’s tracking me! I...I have a past. I’m wor... he put his finger to my lips. Jaxon is very susceptible to it. I’m stronger. What?  Never mind. I have this oil that will keep the burn feeling away. Use it always. The hell? #MeadowsMuse 165
9350 2018-12-16 18:53:44 That’s what it needs to be done
9351 2018-12-16 18:53:40 Because there is a big difference between oil and bitumen.
9352 2018-12-16 18:53:38 Acting like climate change is the fault of individuals is liberal fallacy getting us killed. The problem is:
- oil, coal, & gas, as industries
- unsustainable mining, logging, & manufacturing processes
- animal agriculture and fishing industries
- capitalist overproduction
9353 2018-12-16 18:53:35 The Trudeau Liberals would rather buy oil from a great country like Saudi Arabia instead of the outcasts in Alberta. This is great stance by the Trudeau Govt in showing how Confederation works for all (some/ most) Canadians. Keep Quebec Happy gets him re-elected. Oh Canada!
9354 2018-12-16 18:53:32 OIL PAINTING IS EXPENSIVE AS FUCK BUT SO FUN TO DO IT JUST TAKES WAY TOO LONG AND IS A BITCH TO DRY LIKE I HAD TO HANG UP MY PAINTING FOR 2 DAYS STRAIGHT TO DRY WHY CANT EVERYTHING BE ACRYLICS AND EVEN BETTER WATERCOLORS SHXNWJDJDJ watercolor dry so fast... best medium
9355 2018-12-16 18:53:31 But have you told him yet? He could get 500 messages 
Save The Heid One.
9356 2018-12-16 18:53:31 Saudi murdering, women hating Sheiks send 80,000 barrels of oil per day to Quebec according to PM Trudeau this morning on CTV Question Period ....but he said it in Canadian English so the Equalization Welfare $ Parasites in Quebec wouldn’t notice.
9357 2018-12-16 18:53:23 Sir Teddy, That is not Benghazi. This is the Petrochemical Industrial Complex of Sirte Oil Company located near the town of Marsa El Brega 260km from Benghazi, 360km from Sirte City & 800km from Tripoli. You can see from this map Our company have its own airport & seaport.
9358 2018-12-16 18:53:19 I’m just gonna bring a pillow to school tomorrow and sleep I can’t sleep at all even tho I inhaled like 100000ml of lavender essential oil

9362 2018-12-16 18:52:53 fuck off... Norwegian oil > football
9363 2018-12-16 18:52:45 Don’t have to be rich, but want to have enough money to get the oil changed when it’s time.
9364 2018-12-16 18:52:39 Yeah nah not messing with that Phyrexian Oil m8
9365 2018-12-16 18:52:31 Mental health awareness and social media are like oil and milk. But proceed.
9366 2018-12-16 18:52:30 ALBERTA.... why are we in confederation when we are not wanted?  The east buys oil at a premium from murderous dictatorships yet doesn’t want domestically produced oil meanwhile taking our money. We are being pushed out
9367 2018-12-16 18:52:18 Time for all of us to purchase electric cars. People solar energy is free ? Disrupt the need for oil.  We started off with a small solar panel to charge phones and portable lights.
9368 2018-12-16 18:52:17 Sorry....  
9369 2018-12-16 18:52:12 If oil prices doesn’t go back up the oilfield will start laying people off next year Trump thinks lower oil prices are good but it’s not and when oil goes down it will cause a ripple effect in our economies .
9370 2018-12-16 18:52:09 In return, India got Rs 16,87,660 crores in Foreign Direct Investment. We signed S400 deal with Russia worth Rs 40,000 crores. Saudi Arabia, UAE agreed to invest Rs 4,00,000 crore in Ratnagiri oil refinery. Signed oil storage deal with OPEC nations for Padur and Vizag. (1/n)
9371 2018-12-16 18:52:07 Sack mourinho,get a decent coach and players. Reduce your average players, invest more and then football will be there for you.
9372 2018-12-16 18:51:58 Changed the rear main seal. Hopefully no more oil leaks.
9373 2018-12-16 18:51:53 Health: self-care first. Eat healthily, vit D vit C Fish Oil. Exercise. If you must go to a doc, go to the best. Get 2nd, 3rd opinions. Your health matters
9374 2018-12-16 18:51:51 Economic sabotage. Your income from oil mostly
9375 2018-12-16 18:51:45 5| Uhhhhhh Another Reason Why Poor Ppl Are Broke ?? Guess How Much our Tax Dollars Go To Israel ?? Ain’t We Oil Efficient Now ?? Can’t 400 Million Ppl Make It MANDATORY for Hybrids & Electric Cars Only Along With Being Oil Independent Now ??
9376 2018-12-16 18:51:43 Pep is a man that rode Messi’s coat tail for years, failed in Germany and now has dirty oil money to play with
9377 2018-12-16 18:51:42 I think these cities are of a Veiw that sueing the oil companies is a way to grab some easy money to fund their solar and wind power dreams. The thing is, the oil and gas companies supply a product that they the consumer drives. Perhaps they should sue themselves?
9378 2018-12-16 18:51:42 Tar sands oil is socially unacceptable.
9379 2018-12-16 18:51:24 Хорошо, что я не попадала на твои твиты
9380 2018-12-16 18:51:21 Not even close. Most of the green initiatives are directed at the oil industry who get a pass on much of the carbon tax, still get a sweetheart deal on royalties and other tax subsidies. We get their clean up bill and the burden of the carbon tax.
9381 2018-12-16 18:51:21 You can also give Alfie some coconut oil - I buy the organic brand in a jar for my lil babies ...a teaspoon a day. They sit by the jar at the same time every day, they love it. It’s an all around health benefit 
9382 2018-12-16 18:51:14 I gotta do an oil change but I wanna wait til it stops raining.
9383 2018-12-16 18:50:53 Agreed it isn’t brewing for a recipe of success it’s brewing a recipe of oil and water. A total separation and not an integration for success.
9384 2018-12-16 18:50:45 y'all know that if the 2020 dem candidate isn't an all out progressive with no incentive to be beholden to oil companies that hundreds of millions of people will die in ten years right? this isn't lost on y'all is it?
9385 2018-12-16 18:50:43 Ты аккуратнее, весь мой аккаунт в последние два дня один сплошной спойлер
9386 2018-12-16 18:50:42 #MarketMarchYaba we need this in Port Harcourt esp oil mill market and major bus stops. A tout almost slapped me when I shoved him away for grabbing me by d waist. The most painful part? A woman nursing a female baby was laughing!
9387 2018-12-16 18:50:20 Seems journalists care a lot more about other journalists than good journalism. Good journalism will survive. If it’s bad, or alienates it’s audience, it will die. If journalist cared as much about Coal Miners or Oil/Gas workers as they do themselves, that’s something.
9388 2018-12-16 18:50:14 Is this dude arguing the the oil industry is hard done by?
9389 2018-12-16 18:50:03 can i just say 1. whoever gets to oil chanyeols chest has my dream job 2. im sad chan didn’t perform love shot in the open jacket with the chain necklaces , ok Ty
9390 2018-12-16 18:49:54 so dairy milk is made with palm oil and i think i’ve finally got something to give me a health kick
9391 2018-12-16 18:49:32 Just imagined the face of a supermarket employee when you ask for oil with a specific molecule length 
9392 2018-12-16 18:49:22 Shale oil refining wall
9393 2018-12-16 18:49:21 Go drill for oil
9394 2018-12-16 18:49:17 So you’re talking about power production? Oil only accounts for around 1% of that market.
9395 2018-12-16 18:49:16 Beto = Big Oil.  We need Green New Deal candidates.  Fuck no to Beto
9396 2018-12-16 18:49:05 How do you expect them to discern the source of the gas they put in their car or the oil that goes in their furnace in a way that enables making a choice. That’s nonsense.
9397 2018-12-16 18:49:03 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
9398 2018-12-16 18:48:42 Ignore him Heid. He's attention seeking
9399 2018-12-16 18:48:41 Ko baka da engine oil a motar Kane kwaro
9400 2018-12-16 18:48:40 In the movies,grifting was swindling,cheating snake oil salesmen.  You know, democrats.
9401 2018-12-16 18:48:40 Pogba is more of attacking while herrera and matic are more in defensive so apparently, there’s no attacking midfielder throughout the game that’s my point.
9402 2018-12-16 18:48:35 What’s even more funny is that @francoislegault bases the pipeline social acceptability argument on AIR, there is no independent study implying this, while based on other recent statistics from when the QC Bill 106 was passed, the province is in favor for a local oil & gas sector
9403 2018-12-16 18:48:32 I’m changing but I’ll still slap any bitch ...don’t think you slick. Cause bitch ima bottle of oil hoe. Play with your life
9404 2018-12-16 18:48:19 Do Irving refineries buy Saudi oil, refine and then sell to Quebec?
9405 2018-12-16 18:48:01 The way @ManUtd is going down errh,they will soon discover oil@thenanaaba @CillaCurlcy @KuamiEugene @KinaataGh @OneRJZ @efiaodo1
9406 2018-12-16 18:48:01 I read the qualifying "decline" just happens to be a false statement. Overall consumption of oil is not forecast to DECLINE in the foreseeable future... don't believe me check out the IEA--which is a cheerleader for unreliable and eco unfriendly renewables--even they admit it
9407 2018-12-16 18:48:00 Cringe worthy to say the least. How anyone with any sort of rational thought process can support the current shit show that is our oil economy is beyond compression. “The pipeline is a solution”... Get this pathetic excuse of a PM out of office!!! 
9408 2018-12-16 18:48:00 Pls take black seed oil , half tea spoon sleeping time or first thing in the morning. It reduces  the side effects of chemotherapy,,,, Get well soon.
9409 2018-12-16 18:47:52 Oohhhhooo ni juju sisi hatuna oil rigs  ..
9410 2018-12-16 18:47:40 Also for all the “BuT ThE JoBs” nuts, oil has been working hard to automate more than ever before. 

There are more jobs waiting for us in the conversion to renewables; if anything there is a massive industry waiting to begin; and oil is choking it for threatening its monopoly.
9411 2018-12-16 18:47:37 castor oil itu apa? trus natrep yg mana?
9412 2018-12-16 18:47:29 Caster oil 
9413 2018-12-16 18:47:25 So many amazing superfoods like moringa turmeric and coconut oil and medical advaces likr ionic silver, stem cells, and bemer therapy. And we are supposed to grateful for THIS junk? 
9414 2018-12-16 18:47:24 MCT is Coconut Oil? But you already had Coconut Oil in the list! 
9415 2018-12-16 18:47:23 How much of the recent decline is tied to the stock market and slowing global growth, versus OPEC+ keeping their quotas?

I’m very curious what OPEC countries are going to do that need $80 oil. Your grip on the big picture is much better than mine, but I just don’t see it.
9416 2018-12-16 18:47:17 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9417 2018-12-16 18:47:10 Read this on a post today. #interesting $145  barrel of oil 2015 Diesel per litre £1.19! - $59 barrel of oil 2018 Diesel £1.34 per litre ???
9418 2018-12-16 18:47:07 Because they’re already in bed by the time the Oil hit the ice at 8pm MST. They only see highlights.
9419 2018-12-16 18:47:03 A cooking oil yuh use grease yuh eating apparatus?

9422 2018-12-16 18:46:32 TY Hilton called for a taunting. Literally no one in Lucas Oil Stadium knows why. #Colts #DALvsIND
9423 2018-12-16 18:46:29 Gosh, Crosby Textor have sure been busy giving @simonjbridges his disingenuous 'lines'. Trouble is, when he mixes them up, he says in one breath @jamespeshaw should push harder on climate change then promises a return to gas and oil drilling. Immoral and inept.
9424 2018-12-16 18:46:24 Блэт, я ещё не успела досмотреть...
Ну, всё короче на ближайший месяц надо где-то забарикадироваться. Или поставить запрет на некоторые слова в тви...
9425 2018-12-16 18:46:08 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
9426 2018-12-16 18:46:06 EOG used to stand for Enron Oil and Gas.

9431 2018-12-16 18:45:55 A big chunk of our dollar reservers are used for paying off for crude oil. Replacing it with Indian rupee/ any other material should help. 
India has decided to trade in Indian rupees. Can there be atleast an approximate guess of the impact?? 
I apologise if I am circling around.
9432 2018-12-16 18:45:51 A couple of weeks ago I went to get my oil changed and they come up to me like “you need new tires. Yours are 7 years old.” I was just like “for sure, I’ll get them next time.”

My car isn’t even 7 years old.
9433 2018-12-16 18:45:46 Sad, i assume refining our own oil would significantly increase $ at the pump and that's the reason we export our oil to buy it back once refined. I'm I correct?
9434 2018-12-16 18:45:42 Well I certainly wouldn't choose Christmas carols.  I would go for something with power, Cold Chisel, Angels, AC/DC, INXS, Midnight Oil. I apologise I only listen to classic rock to get me through a hard day. And yes before u say something, they are all Australian, sorry. 
9435 2018-12-16 18:45:41 Coat them in seasoned cornflour and then fry in oil till crisp, then I put on kitchen roll to drain the excess oil, we could have eaten loads more they are that good

9437 2018-12-16 18:45:34 I bet that wall will cost more than the Iraq war and oil won't go up lol
9438 2018-12-16 18:45:33 Add oil
9439 2018-12-16 18:45:05 Olive oil, salt, squeeze of lemon and loads of crushed garlic does the same for me. Also walnuts and olives and avocado and ummm oh yes fries, like the more fries I have on my plate the more salad I require
9440 2018-12-16 18:45:02 Saudi Oil should have a Carbon Tax / Tarrif applied. Canada First. Wake up Butts. Liberals are destroying our country.
9441 2018-12-16 18:44:58 and continue oil exploration...back to the future
9442 2018-12-16 18:44:31 So what are their oil sources? Is some from here?
9443 2018-12-16 18:44:04 Bridges just told #RNZ he doesn't give a stuff for NZ and the future of our climate .Will bring back oil and gas offshore exp;oration and doesnt agree with the scientist that it is going to fuck civilisation. Also wrong on Paris/US. 
Nats will kill your kids future #nzpol #cop24

9445 2018-12-16 18:43:28 This. For someone supposedly so astute at business the sheer stupid he's spouting about separatism fixing our Oil & Gas problem really makes me question if he's become completely unhinged.

9447 2018-12-16 18:42:58 Unapologetically saying no all 2019. Doing all things I wanna say no too
Travel , sex, pampering myself , lathering my skin in coconut oil.
9448 2018-12-16 18:42:58 i wanna learn how to do an oil change, cause when i need one i can just do it myself.
9449 2018-12-16 18:42:55 Mine is Oil of Olay, $12 and I look 10 yrs younger than I am
9450 2018-12-16 18:42:50 The American Embassy in Dublin has to be one of the most disgusting buildings I’ve seen. 

Looks like a glorified oil tank and doesn’t fit in with the Georgian Architecture at all around it.
9451 2018-12-16 18:42:47 asked Kierran to cover our food with FOIL and I turn around to see him pouring OIL over it asking what I said ??? Why are boys so impulsive 
9452 2018-12-16 18:42:46 Cuddled up in bed with my puppers Pacey James, he hasn't been feeling good lately. Had his first dose of full spectrum pet hemp oil over a scrambled egg. I have chicken and stars soup with oyster crackers! — watching Man On Fire

9454 2018-12-16 18:42:42 I take oil of oregano  when I start feeling under the weather... my flu last year lasted 3 days instead of a week or more. #gonatural
9455 2018-12-16 18:42:31 Henry Kissinger is her friend and mentor, she supports fracking, big oil, Wall St. drones, War. Drug war and is anti-single payer. How can anyone with this on their resume be seriously called progressive?! She too the right of Reagan! Also HENRY KISSINGER
9456 2018-12-16 18:42:24 I can't vote AB NDP because they've crawled into bed with big oil and refuse to get out.

9458 2018-12-16 18:42:19 Thank you. I have sent “Ducks” to people I was trying to find common ground with about the oil sands. I have sent your Stompin’ Tom comic to folks. You make the world better. Do what you need. It’ll be good.
9459 2018-12-16 18:42:16 does it have palm oil in? think sainsburys are pretty good labelling them vegan

9461 2018-12-16 18:41:57 The number of supporters maybe quite declining
9462 2018-12-16 18:41:45 Too much of red oil
9463 2018-12-16 18:41:41 You're lucky if you don't get unnecessary oil in your hair on everyday basis.
9464 2018-12-16 18:41:37 @realDonaldTrump Good day,I would like you to stop Fracking. In  Oklahoma
they're having thousands of mini earthquakes  which are caused by the oil companies fracking.
9465 2018-12-16 18:41:34 I have stay my friends w dog tonight.oil everywhere in. Basement into my furnace.i need break
9466 2018-12-16 18:41:30 I read the ingredients of the FOUR brands of regular graham crackers, and ALL FOUR were made with canola oil. I had to buy “honey graham sticks” from the organic bullshit section.
9467 2018-12-16 18:41:28 Why is oil paint so p r i c e y
9468 2018-12-16 18:41:25 A different political system needs to be put in place. New laws need to be written. And we need to come to an understanding that our obsession for the mighty dollar is dragging oil into our oceans, melting away our ice at the poles, causing world spread poverty...
9469 2018-12-16 18:41:16 too much of red oil.
9470 2018-12-16 18:41:15 Time for the snake oil salesman to resign !
9471 2018-12-16 18:41:15 It's used as a motor flush on old gummed up Motors and not meant to be left in. Go the economic route and use diesel fluid. It will loosen up your rings, lifters, un-gum your motor!
Let it run in park for 5 to 10 minutes drain and replace with oil.
9472 2018-12-16 18:41:10 You cant slick a can of oil
9473 2018-12-16 18:41:10 You are a pure liar. Who established the refineries and since 1980s how don't we have a functional refinery in 38yrs even under massive oil boom btw 1999-2014.
9474 2018-12-16 18:41:10 That's the problem when you have a leader that gets, presumably unwanted, "help" from the outside to make him a dictator (in the 50s, the CIA and others overthrew a PM who wanted to nationalize oil)
9475 2018-12-16 18:40:55 Why is there so many Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil? #BoyBye lol
9476 2018-12-16 18:40:55 Infrastructure, no health premiums, no sales tax, and free University... but NO, Alberta is entitled, we’re whiners, evil conservatives and don’t give a shit about the world because we love “dirty oil”

If you think Albertans are “Trupian style conservatives” have Kenny try and
9477 2018-12-16 18:40:52 There is significant amount of truth to this cartoon,
But don’t be fooled into believing this is just a Quebec attack!

Justine and the liberals have committed large sums of money to shut down Alberta’s oil industry!

Billions to:
BC
Trans pipeline 
Quebec 
The eastern provinces

9482 2018-12-16 18:40:25 Oil will be around a lot longer than you think dum dum ... talking to sheep gets monotonous...

Just because you’re afraid of dirt under your prissy fingernails doesn’t mean a real man can’t earn good money without a degree...

But I’m sure you wouldn’t understand manhood

9485 2018-12-16 18:40:15 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9486 2018-12-16 18:40:15 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9487 2018-12-16 18:40:15 Lol oil & gas are more nuanced! Really? Great thinking there Simon Bridges. I really want you in charge. #not Great that you think "we've got some time to think it through" #ClimateChange #ActOnClimate #NatsWontAct

9490 2018-12-16 18:40:07 There’s nothing quite like sitting in a Whole Foods, sipping Topo Chico, eavesdropping on oil executives having their after church discussions about the dangers of socialism.
9491 2018-12-16 18:40:06 The @NZNationalParty leader @simonjbridges is on @rnz_news @NZMorningReport now saying National will bring back oil and gas exploration if they are reelected, and repeating nonsense about needing more fossil fuels (gas) for the transition. #dinosaur

9498 2018-12-16 18:39:45 Well recipe for it as follows:

Cream Cheese spread
Franks Hot Sauce
tofu (or seltan chicken)

Mix in a bowl till you get a light-moderate orange tint.

freeze for 1-2 hours.

After freezing, cut into stick-shapes, flour - flax-egg - breadcrumbs.
Veg oil for frying!
9499 2018-12-16 18:39:36 Gas from these gas fields would of course be sold on the global market as Ireland sold all natural oil gas and natural resources for pennies under troika and means gas prices in ireland would not see a decline.
9500 2018-12-16 18:39:36 We don’t need more gas & oil exploration @simonjbridges .
Why would we need to import coal when there is no ban on its extraction?

9505 2018-12-16 18:38:54 ROTTEN DEMOCRATS have forced Interior Secretary Zinke to resign. They threatened him with continuing the 14 corruption cases against him in January. Oil and coal companies will miss him. Me too

9506 2018-12-16 18:38:49 With no parameters on ingredients I'd recommend Sweetbreads a la Trump.  While Trump's brain will be fatty (he strongly denies it) it can be crisped in a sauce pan with some olive oil & herbs.  A corruption reduction sauce would be a great addition.
9507 2018-12-16 18:38:46 National will reintroduce oil and gas exploration. Unequivocal statement by Simon Bridges on @radionz.

9511 2018-12-16 18:38:16 How much was a barrel of oil in the international market? How much did they meet fuel and how many times did they increase it? How much was dollar when they took over from Abacha? Didn't infighting ruin their 2nd term? How was infrastructure when they left? We ain't kids here

9518 2018-12-16 18:37:46 Olive oil.    Why ?
9519 2018-12-16 18:37:33 Except that we now know Quebec gets almost all its oil from Alberta and absolutely none - 0% - from Saudi Arabia.  Why are you and @jkenney so afraid of a fully- informed electorate? #ableg #cdnpoli
9520 2018-12-16 18:37:25 I'm so sorry. Have you tried CBD oil and products? There's been some research showing it destroys some cancer cells
9521 2018-12-16 18:37:24 I don't even understand what is happening again oh. There's this viewing center in my area that no longer show Man Utd match again and it's not as if they don't have enough fans there

9531 2018-12-16 18:36:37 They made an unprecedented revenue from our oil that was selling as high as $140b under PDP but they spent all with no savings!
So ask them where are the infrastructures that they should have built with the huge loans, depleted foreign reserve &unprecedented oil revenue?

9540 2018-12-16 18:35:43 Right. And I understand your frustration that the benefits of oil may be threatened. My point is simply that in QC, what they hear is, "We're sick of being treated like the richest province while people attack the thing that made us the richest province" and they don't care.

9554 2018-12-16 18:34:01 Nonsense! China is paying the same discounted price that you complain the Americans are paying. When globally, oil prices fall you can’t expect to make the same amount of money by simply producing more. Over production and a supply glut pulled Alberta sludge down, not pipelines.

9567 2018-12-16 18:32:47 See, give it a couple of years (early to mid 1990s) and that’s when he probably got in deep with the golden toilet, Russian Oil Oligarchs and the former-Soviet-satellite fashion models who pee on you in 5-star hotel rooms for American dollars.  (KGB in every corner.)
9568 2018-12-16 18:32:46 The big mystery: will it be someone from the oil & gas industry or someone from the coal industry?

9572 2018-12-16 18:32:16 From the perspective of outsiders (I'm not really stating my own perspective per se, but "popular opinion") your, "our fossil fuels gave us the 'convenience' of super low taxes", is another person's "we thought the oil boom would never end, so we kept taxes low but kept spending"
9573 2018-12-16 18:32:11 We played with no passion, no attacking sense and we got outplayed throughout the game. Mourinho needs to go period
9574 2018-12-16 18:32:03 No one said there wasn't any pipelines or Albertan oil being processed/consumed in QC. Neither of these leaders want the oil industry expanded.

You continual bashing of QC is nothing short of "manufactured hatred".
9575 2018-12-16 18:31:59 He fucking deserves it, no player is bigger than the club
9576 2018-12-16 18:31:59 It was a private company that specializes in oil infrastructure carrying the financial burden not sure how any one could say it doesn’t make sense I think they might have a better understanding than you or I .
9577 2018-12-16 18:31:36 @thereallisaann I really hope Southside treated you well last night, I wanted to be there but my oil in car has gotten too low to risk heading out there in rain, my punishment was getting followed by one of your copycats this morning 
9578 2018-12-16 18:31:34 You will repeal carbon tax, buy pipelines, create massive debt, polute and give money to all the oil workers without jobs. We know.

9591 2018-12-16 18:30:03 We will continue to promote truth and hopefully Albertans won’t be fooled. 2% of the nations fresh water supply, tar sands destroys 4-6 barrels of fresh water for every barrel of oil. The cost of desalination? Today? 410% average increase annually per family.

9596 2018-12-16 18:29:57 Hi Polish. As I understand it, they mean the porosity doesn't need to be so high as previously described for the oil to flow...That's my take, but I'm no expert..A positive..

9601 2018-12-16 18:29:32 Fail to realize if they actual helped Alberta, helped the oil industry, the amount of equalization would become so great that like some Nordic (and left leaning countries like Canada) we could fund water treatment in Quebec and BC so Montreal and Victoria would have to dump crap
9602 2018-12-16 18:29:28 Wow!!! Mexico is an OIL RICH Country!! And, they have the ability to FIX their own Country. They won’t!!! They are and have always been corrupt!!! There is no reason for the condition of Mexico other than PURE GREED, LACK OF RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, MONEY!
9603 2018-12-16 18:29:27 Energy company doing energy things. It isn’t transitioning oil workers into kindergarten teachers as seems to be the idea in many quarters. Reality is, these renewables have their place but they are light years from replacing oil.

9610 2018-12-16 18:28:57 Can you explain to me why all oil used in Canada should not come from Canada? Pipelines are much safer than ships coming up the St Lawrence or oil coming by rail.
9611 2018-12-16 18:28:51 I see you answered my question below.  Still, this is no justification for not allowing a pipeline to be built.  Regardless of source Canadians in Quebec use oil.  Why not support a domestic industry?

9616 2018-12-16 18:27:37 If BP's gushing oil would one day we commit ourselves to live in a stagnant world, devoid of curiosity, empty of dreams.
9617 2018-12-16 18:27:37 Sweet baby Jesus it’s all because of the benefits of oil , which Quebec also has , but refuses to extract ;-)

9620 2018-12-16 18:27:19 Busy few days. Thanks to all our rescuers. Broken wing transferred from our friends at Swan Support. Sally and Ian picked up the poor swan with a pike hook in its neck and beak. A very underweight swan from Isleworth  with oil damaged feathers brought in by Natalie.
9621 2018-12-16 18:27:17 Pls research and make video on Dhodak Oil Field. What went wrong there? You may also look into oil spitting in D.I. Khan (Umer Kot)
Thanks

9624 2018-12-16 18:26:33 Is that I would love for all of Canada, and every Canadian to have more... I have no issue with equalization, I have issue with those who want equalization, but actively fight against supporting it...

While Quebec actively fights “dirty Oil” and dumps tones of raw sewage they
9625 2018-12-16 18:26:28 I went to an oil+gas company party once and it was worse. Worse food, worse lines, and even more stress on people about not remembering names of co-worker's +1s.
9626 2018-12-16 18:26:16 Nicola Sturgeon is still getting away with appearing on national tv to extol the virtues of her White Paper.

Why does no one point out it estimated oil revenue of £40 billion more than has been taken since 2014?
9627 2018-12-16 18:26:06 where’s my hair oil oml i cant let my hairline recede like that my hair is one of the few good things about me
9628 2018-12-16 18:26:02 Our whole argument does not rest on oil. It never has.
9629 2018-12-16 18:25:59 They don't want an oil pipeline passing through, but a couple of years ago dumping about half a million liters of sewage into the St. Lawrence was okay. 
So, glad I live up river.
Would they prefer it ship up the Seaway?

9639 2018-12-16 18:24:51 COOOOOP CHANTS IN LUCAS OIL WE LOVE IT
9640 2018-12-16 18:24:48 Lies. Bulk of the oil now comes from US and Canada. If you can’t win with the truth, give up. Recklessly pitting Canadians against each other with lies to gain support shows exactly why you aren’t fit to govern.
9641 2018-12-16 18:24:36 Basically what Richard said, gas prices have a whole bunch of input factors of which the oil price is just one. Local factors often outweigh global ones for commodities where transportation can represent a significant cost vs the value of the underlying good.
9642 2018-12-16 18:24:30 Lmao an oil diffuser
9643 2018-12-16 18:24:02 Roses are red, violets are blue, if it wasn’t for oil money, you’d be in league 2
9644 2018-12-16 18:23:50 Oil-n-me sounds about right 
9645 2018-12-16 18:23:35 A ferry isn’t loaded down with 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge like an Aframax oil tanker would be. A ferry doesn’t have to wait for the tides so it doesn’t scrape bottom or hit any bridge it’s passing the under while sailing through the very populated Metro Vancouver.
9646 2018-12-16 18:23:29 Because this is not a black or white issue, there are many shades of grey. You can be liberal minded, believe in climate change/global warming, want a carbon tax, etc. At the same time believe that developing the oil & gas industry benefits Canadians and Canada as a whole.
9647 2018-12-16 18:23:22 Can we make synthetic palm oil?

9649 2018-12-16 18:23:08 Irving was willing to build a deep water port , and investors were extremely interested in building upgraders in Saint John to process The bitumen to get a better price with the refined oil .
9650 2018-12-16 18:23:02 I am heavy handed with the cheese, think I used half the block  I found it in asda, and as with all the @ButeIslandFoods range it's palm oil free 
9651 2018-12-16 18:22:46 The humiliation is just too much.
9652 2018-12-16 18:22:42 BUT you can use more oil just not less..it can cover them if you prefer
9653 2018-12-16 18:22:41 Hi Lizzie, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks, Donna.

9655 2018-12-16 18:22:33 Well I do know that before the socialist government took over, Venezuela was the richest country in South America.  They have huge oil reserves, yet people are starving and leaving the country in droves.  Explain that
9656 2018-12-16 18:22:31 Built with English money. Much of it is around the Shetlands, I would suggest giving them an indy vote to be independent or go back to Norway. They would be fucking loaded without the Scottish soaking up their oil money on benefits and buckfast.
9657 2018-12-16 18:22:05 It was in distress cause there was nothing in the oil reserves tank.
U forgot that u drained it out for small amount of wd-40 .
You still needed to put oil in after .
Oil was the grease. 
The car was running on air.thats the high pitch u heard.
9658 2018-12-16 18:21:50 Can’t go wrong with a good old-fashioned prime rib roast. Boneless- easier to carve for a crowd. Coat with olive oil, season with salt/pepper, a little onion powder, garlic powder and paprika. If you want to get fancy, put thin slices of garlic into tiny slits in the meat.
9659 2018-12-16 18:21:46 Take heart brother u’r not the only one
9660 2018-12-16 18:21:41 Sad you continue to attack with no facts. Thoughts on Paris agreement? If you read it... or Chinese oil deal? Or historic low unemployment rates across the board and especially with minorities? Stop leading with emotions. The 2 original persons who conducted said he was innocent
9661 2018-12-16 18:21:37 To the  oil & gas industry:

Look at what just happened to salmon farming in BC. Due to un-checked activism, 1/4 of its operations are being CLOSED by govt. Ignore this at your peril.

Ask yourself: where is  oil & gas going to be 10 years from now? Same could happen to you.
9662 2018-12-16 18:21:28 Haven't smoked the oil but I've smoked the weed. It's pretty good
9663 2018-12-16 18:21:17 1. Learn what imperialism means
2. The internationally recognised government of Syria invited its allies Iran & Russia to defend it against a foreign invasion
3. The US is illegally occupying Syrian land and blocking Syrians access to their own oil
That's whats happening in Syria

9665 2018-12-16 18:21:06 Also note that Irving has said they might very well continue to import Saudi oil even if Energy East were built

9672 2018-12-16 18:20:37 I need to take more classes on essential oils. I know they are extremely beneficial. When I had a fever, a friend gave me lavender oil to apply at my temples and the nape of my neck for fevers. Excellent advice. It works beautifully.
9673 2018-12-16 18:20:28 The paper I read said that hydro is calculated at the actual price charged while oil and gas are calculated at the projected best price. So there ya incentive to underprice hydro, both to keep costs low for citizens and to continue to get payments.

9686 2018-12-16 18:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
9687 2018-12-16 18:19:26 Again a blanket observation of someone who lives here NOW but hasn’t their whole life and does not remember the years (yes Kline years)

When money was put aside, when savings where a priority, when thinking of the future was done, when oil was used to encourage diversification.
9688 2018-12-16 18:19:19 Saudi oil goes to NB and to the US and then goes to Quebec. Those refineries not only refine all pollution and CO2 out of the oil, but reverse all of the sexism and homophobia incurred in Saudi Arabia.
9689 2018-12-16 18:19:18 You see those glass doors open? The oil is going inside!
9690 2018-12-16 18:19:14 I was responding to her tweet, which was incorrect and still is. You have decided to enter a debate on whether we should import Saudi oil or use domestic.  Another conversation. Have a nice day
9691 2018-12-16 18:19:12 The oil is in Scotland's territory. International law applies.

The "assetts" you talk about in the EU are intangibles.
9692 2018-12-16 18:19:08 Oil & vinegar raver 
9693 2018-12-16 18:19:06 Yes. The formula is generally considered on a roughly quinquennial basis. However, nothing prevents Parliament from revising it at other times. So, for example, it could have been amended in 2014 or early 2015 when oil prices fell.
9694 2018-12-16 18:19:00 If talk of separation wakes people to the inequality and unfair treatment Albertans, and our oil sector faces I’m good with it. It’s so frustrating to give away money that we desperately could use to Eastern Canadians whom criticize where it came from yet still willingly take.

9697 2018-12-16 18:18:51 Бляяяя
9698 2018-12-16 18:18:45 As someone concerned about the environment, and the future, build the pipeline. Just do it, build the pipeline, no one understands how long it'll take to get off oil.  The pipeline will reduce environmental impact, and who knows maybe one-day It'll pump something other than oil.
9699 2018-12-16 18:18:40 Oil prices are down globally, which is why in the East where we buy oil they’re enjoying record low prices on gasoline. They’re down even more in the West, where we export oil due to over production and a supply glut that the industry was warned about over a year ago.

9701 2018-12-16 18:18:32 Adam is right. I've been at it for over 35 years. My tolerance is quite high. No pun. But the Health benefits far out way the side effects. My intuition is Spot on these days. Full spectrum oil taken at night Should do the trick. The Benefits are in the Sleep.
9702 2018-12-16 18:18:26 Cheap oil is like cheap drugs. It gets people too addicted too fast and they wont be able to give it up too easily.
9703 2018-12-16 18:18:17 The question is whether we will need that much crude oil for the lifetime of a new pipeline.  If the world is going to reduce emissions enough to meet Paris targets I think the answer may be no.
9704 2018-12-16 18:18:11 So curious what about my internet habits and lifestyle would lead to a targeted ad by a pro-pipeline org?

- lives in BC, the province widely against your pipeline & the one that will be spilled in
- tweets constantly in support of #ClimateAction and against oil
- is liberal AF

9706 2018-12-16 18:17:53 If I ever need a bottle of snake oil, I know just the salesman
9707 2018-12-16 18:17:49 We'll likely disagree but I'd argue Energy East died because it was a $16B project proposed shortly before the price of oil went from $100/barrel down to $39/barrel, and it's only back at $51 today. Regulations are a good scapegoat, but the project no longer made economic sense.
9708 2018-12-16 18:17:44 Venezeula destroyed their capitalist economy and now people starve to death despite oil. I lived in Japan for years, and they have social programs on par with Scandinavia. They are always on the edge of fiscal crisis, lack oil, and its only their economy that keeps them afloat. 2

9730 2018-12-16 18:15:32 What do you suppose the chance of something bad happening from one of those many OPEC tankers steaming up the St Lawrence daily is. They don't have to meet Canadian double hull regs or environmental or human rights standards either. Cuz that's sooo much better than Alberta oil.
9731 2018-12-16 18:15:30 Oh for sure. I tricked myself into thinking he was one of the good ones. Then he had on a bunch of big oil climate change deniers to "both sides" the dire UN climate report. Don't watch @chucktodd
9732 2018-12-16 18:15:22 Yeah and Trump is cutting regulations to bolster US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices on Putin's orders.

9734 2018-12-16 18:15:11 Should be top by at least 10 points by now shouldn't we.... Even the messiah Pep had bad days in his first season and he inherited the oil rich city side. If Emery gets us 4th this year that'll be a monster achievement
9735 2018-12-16 18:15:01 GAIL since its inception is converting waste material into valuable & further value added product e.g. once waste of oil wells used to be burnt as waste gas at Bombay high oil wells is now fueling so many fertilizer, power, Polymer & LPG plants..Same will be Biogas in near future
9736 2018-12-16 18:15:00 Someone gave Tosin cookies made with this oil. She thought she was running mad and we had to tie her down! No jokes
9737 2018-12-16 18:14:45 Butts is distorting the numbers by showing refined oil in QC. But the consumed petroleum products come from all over, including the Middle East. Price is the primary determinant.
9738 2018-12-16 18:14:43 Great, but none of this makes them actually socialist. Oil and gas subsidies are great, but its free money that not every country has, it masks a lot of problems, and they only help if you have the capitalist engine to leverage it. 1/2

9742 2018-12-16 18:14:15 And I corrected her statement. But your premise is disingenuous as much of that imported oil, not all is consumed in Quebec and Ontario. Also the 50% from the US is bought at the market price and while we sell Canada’s oil in the west at a high discount. We look like chumps.

9748 2018-12-16 18:13:45 Culture overpowers everything at the end. Asians have goals. What are our goals?

We have spent 50+ years unduly welded together just because of an irrational and unproductive urge for Niger-Delta oil. What are our goals?
9749 2018-12-16 18:13:40 Oh, sorry. 
I agree. 
Resistance to pipelines is just an “easy” way out for people who don’t want to take responsibility for their own activities (The Whistler fiasco another example). And restricting Alberta oil just means another producer fills the gap and our economy loses.
9750 2018-12-16 18:13:38 Sitting at @mrlube getting an oil change done on this car of mine and GUESS WHAT COMPANY JUST EMAILED ME ABOUT GETTING THAT DONE SOON?
9751 2018-12-16 18:13:29 9 parts have been used to oil the asiwaju patronage system....corruption pure and simple!
9752 2018-12-16 18:13:28 I use Olbas Oil when I have a cold that’s good too:)))...using it a lot at the moment:/xxx
9753 2018-12-16 18:13:27 В смысле Марго? Какого фига? Ты же должна
9754 2018-12-16 18:13:27 i put coconut oil on my eyes ( mainly lashes) and kept it on for some time and now they look darker and like 1mm longer BLESS
9755 2018-12-16 18:13:22 Maybe get a diffuser (I recommend Doterra) and try a lavender oil. Some companies also sell a sleepytime oil/spray...I usually see them for kids, but nothing says adults can’t use them. I have a diffuser and it really helps. I’m a monster if I don’t get enough sleep 
9756 2018-12-16 18:12:58 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
9757 2018-12-16 18:12:56 Irving Oil needs feedstock to process for their US market ... and they just happen to be rich Liberal partisans will support Saudi oil over our own eastern pipeline?
9758 2018-12-16 18:12:55 I’ve always supported President Trump’s push for drilling for our own oil. I mean, it makes sense 
9759 2018-12-16 18:12:51 Hi Andrew. Your coalition has taken a very principled stance against the pipeline Trans Mountain pipeline, so I’m quite confused and would like answers as to why BC government doesn’t have the same stance towards oil patches and fracking in BC?
9760 2018-12-16 18:12:49 OTD in 1979 OPEC states raise oil prices
9761 2018-12-16 18:12:39 Well, I get grossed out by oil monsters, I can't help it
9762 2018-12-16 18:12:37 Is it necessary to find the coconut butter?  Could I just whip the coconut oil to make it into a fluffy butter myself?
9763 2018-12-16 18:12:37 Olivia Colman asking me to give money to starving kids in Yemen it's a great cause but why don't all the oil rich Arab countries nearby sort it out?!
9764 2018-12-16 18:12:33 hmm okay i can respect that, ive just heard several vegans say that the oil isnt vegan, but youre right u cant just pick and choose
9765 2018-12-16 18:12:31 Racks of lamb, butterflied. Blend a thick paste of chopped garlic (lots), rosemary (lots), olive oil, and pepper. Coat liberally and let stand for 4-5 hrs. Roast 10 minutes per side. Fed 14 with this; everyone raved.
9766 2018-12-16 18:12:28 Haha grade A stuff this one . The kind that pirates take before seizing oil tankers on the Indian Ocean
9767 2018-12-16 18:12:27 Tis all I care about. I must spend a solid 10-20 minutes each day turning lamps on and off, not to mention the daily refilling of my essential oil mister. Best use of my time.
9768 2018-12-16 18:12:20 A meal in 5 minutes! Ribeye steak grilled with pancetta mince and olive oil.

9771 2018-12-16 18:11:58 Where do the Mortal Engines cities go for an oil change?
9772 2018-12-16 18:11:55 Every parent needs to give their kid headphones. I don’t want to listen to whatever YouTube video they’re watching while I wait for my oil change.
9773 2018-12-16 18:11:41 “It always does. I get submerged in freezing water. You get boiled in oil.. did you forget?”
9774 2018-12-16 18:11:40 Why would we give up the oil fields if we left the UK. Are the UK going to give up their oil fields if they leave the EU?

The UK government has done nothing but take from the oil fields.
9775 2018-12-16 18:11:22 "I wanted to destroy everything beautiful I’d never  have. Burn the Amazon rain forests. Pump chlorofluorocarbons straight  up to gobble the ozone. Open the dump valves on supertankers and uncap  offshore oil wells." ...

9778 2018-12-16 18:11:11 I just got bamboozled into getting my sister an oil change 
9779 2018-12-16 18:11:07 We'll oil up the Sherman tank.
9780 2018-12-16 18:10:59 Just getting ready to post peppermint oil, but figured someone had to have recommended it!!! It works!
9781 2018-12-16 18:10:49 I would be thrilled if you visited Maine. I have tons of infused coconut oil to cook with and also I'm a chef :D :D
9782 2018-12-16 18:10:46 Очень. Особенно учитывая то, что я без понятия, буду ли  я в роли гг, или Марго, при том, что Марго по идее автор
9783 2018-12-16 18:10:44 Does the data show origin for gasoline products? I've never been sure whether the Irving Oil facility in NB ships stuff to QC, but they DO have Saudi oil going through there. May be a knock on effect there where QC isn't importing SA oil to its refineries but is still buying it?
9784 2018-12-16 18:10:39 i haven't done a professional treatment but have tried it at home so grain of salt. honestly felt like i'd coated my hair in plastic. i'd rather leave it in coconut oil overnight, supersoft the next day.
9785 2018-12-16 18:10:39 I keep mine in fridge. Amazing for sandwiches. Don’t use non stick spray in loafpan...poison. Use coconut oil (cold pressed virgin) or olive oil, extra virgin. And FYI...it’s delicious.
9786 2018-12-16 18:10:35 China is printing Zimbabwe's new currency notes and are getting paid with oil and diamonds for their service but Africa why

9787 2018-12-16 18:10:30 Well that should quiet the Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil Stadium! 
9788 2018-12-16 18:10:25 The US is 100% self sufficient in oil. You’re living 40 years in the past.
9789 2018-12-16 18:10:22 Olive oil can't find a job he likes

9793 2018-12-16 18:10:08 Market access is a dilemma of your own making over 40 years of short-sighted conservative rule and oil barons more concerned with profits than planning for the future. What can be done to help you us being done, but will take time
9794 2018-12-16 18:10:03 It’s way too many Cowboys fans in Lucas Oil... I’m already irritated #colts
9795 2018-12-16 18:10:03 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
9796 2018-12-16 18:09:56 So are Scotland going to pay their share of the national debt? Give up the oil fields that the UK has invested money in. You have no clue whatsoever, you're just a low information, bigoted runt. I try really hard not to react to the ignorance you tweet.
9797 2018-12-16 18:09:53 Thank you Stalin ji... I WANT MODI TO BE DEFEATED AS RAJINI WIL NOT CONTEST 2019... with 2 years of ANTI INCUMBENCY AND HUGE OIL PRICE PEOPLE WIL BE AGAINST CENTER AND STATE AND LOOK OF NEW ALTERNATIVE THATS RAJINI.. MODI LOSS IS STEPPING STONE FOR RAJINI CM  #SadistPM
9798 2018-12-16 18:09:51 Lucas Oil needs to be a fucking bearpit today
9799 2018-12-16 18:09:50 Not idiots. Criminals. An alliance of RU SA US Israel UAE defeating Iran, controlling the glut of oil reserves.
Hamstring alt-energy. Keeping us fossil fuel dependent. It's an agenda.

Go ahead, call me a nut.
9800 2018-12-16 18:09:47 Facts & the truth is a foregone conclusion that he'll lie. Millions of us are still in sticker shock. With this #DT1, it's like an oil spillage daily in a wet ocean in h3ll that cleaning crews have to contain the mess & clean up his daily lies.
9801 2018-12-16 18:09:43 Drinking oregano oil tastes like if you put a band-aid in water and let it sit for a day before chugging it #wellness
9802 2018-12-16 18:09:41 So, how is oil getting subsidized? Corn gets heavy subsidies as part of ethanol mandate which I disagree with; the food aspect for corn and dairy is more complicated but they are food and not a Tesla.  There are other options for cars.
9803 2018-12-16 18:09:32 
9804 2018-12-16 18:09:30 OIl money has made the Glazers model of ownership even more redundant. It could be another 26 season effort

9807 2018-12-16 18:09:19 Turn away, vegan and vegetarian friends

because I'm here to say that I just seared lamb chops in butter and olive oil and this is the most delicious lunch I've ever had in my life.
9808 2018-12-16 18:09:16 Back in the game Mr. Oil.
9809 2018-12-16 18:09:15 :)  xx
9810 2018-12-16 18:09:11 That blood orange olive oil is LOVE.
9811 2018-12-16 18:09:10 You’re all about AB not using oil sands but you have no problem with Quebec rejecting our pipeline on principle but then continuing to use oil from SA, where you’re quiet as can be!

9815 2018-12-16 18:08:32 It’s probably my oil based so it’s resistant to water.

9821 2018-12-16 18:08:11 getting my oil changed and everyone in this place is huffing and puffing. yeesh.
9822 2018-12-16 18:08:09 I’m learning more about Oil exporting than I really want too
9823 2018-12-16 18:07:52 Oil change on babe
9824 2018-12-16 18:07:44 My dad asked what I wanted for Christmas. I said an oil change & tune up lol wish I was still 10 ;(
9825 2018-12-16 18:07:42 right, but palm oil ruins rainforests and the animals in it, so why is it vegan? other than not being an animal product, idk ive heard from a lottt of vegans that palm oil is not ok
9826 2018-12-16 18:07:39 I been slicker than a can of oil since I was knee high to a duck
9827 2018-12-16 18:07:37 Cash at hand:
@Apple $237.1bn.
@Microsoft $135.9bn.
$373bn.
Both are just $2.8bn shy of having as much liquid cash as the entire 2017 GDP of Nigeria/@AsoRock $375.8bn; an OPEC nation of ~180m people.

Nothing is more powerful than tech innovation, not oil,Govt's or money..Nothing
9828 2018-12-16 18:07:31 Canada doesn't, oil companies do and the temporary and drastic decline in price has since corrected itself with the return of some American refineries to service. I agree that takeaway capacity needs to increase, preferably to "tidewater", hence TMX purchase.
9829 2018-12-16 18:07:31 SAME. IM SQUEEZING AND TEA TREE OIL and fjehjfkskfkw
9830 2018-12-16 18:07:27 #IWouldBeShlashed too. Came to do my undergraduate studies, then I did a PhD which incidentally was industry funded. I then worked as a postdoc also earning far less than the 30k threshold. Eventually I did work in the oil industry where I started off on 30k.
9831 2018-12-16 18:07:24 Great question. It's not conflicting. The graph above is for Quebec only. The oil imports from Saudi Arabia go to New Brunswick.
9832 2018-12-16 18:07:16 Savanna’s dad made the family instant oatmeal and is cooking the dogs eggs and meat with coconut oil  love him
9833 2018-12-16 18:07:13 Abeg no forget we get better Palm Oil wey dey alright
9834 2018-12-16 18:07:08 i’m so surprised, he’s my climate denying big oil senator,
another home state embarrassment
9835 2018-12-16 18:06:51 Asin bro better oil dey ur head 
9836 2018-12-16 18:06:39 Guys, please I need some clarification here Is it true that, wearing of CONDOMS kills 90% of the male cells leading to low sperm counts? Do the oil in the condom turn to powder after you are done with the assigned job? Advice to save a brother please

9838 2018-12-16 18:06:20 Much rare UK media coverage of Zinke resignation. Kent Pocahontas Warren on warpath for scalps to protect First Nations and USA parks from Big Oil etc. USA far ahead of UK. Time for Change
9839 2018-12-16 18:06:12 Sending love & best wishes to staff and animals at @chesterzoo - having worked on the palm oil and songbird songs with @ashleyfayth I know how dedicated and passionate the staff are with the creatures in their care.
9840 2018-12-16 18:06:08 Most of the responses from this group of deniers has been very bad.  Usually no links, bad graphs without who it is by or it is from a paid anti GW think tank or organization funded by big Oil & Gas.  I love it, you guys are giving me lots of material for my projects.  
9841 2018-12-16 18:05:59 So much of learning how to adult is figuring out the best way to get oil off of dishes
9842 2018-12-16 18:05:52 Oil and gas industry is as powerful as we make it. I chose to not fly, drive electric, heat with biomass. Thus reducing their power a little bit by my individual action. Without many many more of us changing their individual behaviour no diplomatic effort will change anything.
9843 2018-12-16 18:05:47 I am very particular about the gas that goes in my car...only premium. That is how I am about what fuels my spirit...I don't fill up on a word because its there...
For this next level I require...high octane oil...premium anointing, mediore won't do...
9844 2018-12-16 18:05:32 Man doesn’t even know what sport he’s watching. Commercial businessman, lock him behind the scenes to strike deals with more watch brands and oil companies
9845 2018-12-16 18:05:27 He would probably want to start giving a shit. You can do alot in this world but dont piss of the americans, especially if you have access to oil
9846 2018-12-16 18:05:16 I think Stephen Miller is beautiful. I am body positive and if a man wants to rub oil over his hairless body because he thinks it looks good, the government should pay for it
9847 2018-12-16 18:05:11 They are special afterall they import foreign oil drain the rest of of transfer payments and pollute their waterways #boycottqc
9848 2018-12-16 18:05:08 Reduce deficit, reform GOP tax bill, investigate voting machines, restore all federal land and ban oil/gas drilling & mining, establish border task force to investigate migrant camps for graft/corruption, establish task force on electoral college reform, help central america.
9849 2018-12-16 18:05:07 Alberta needs to move to Thorium Nuclear + Alternative  from oil. They could be Canada's leader for this, but need to let go of the past, and embrace the new energy technologies. It would be a better future for Alberta and the world.
9850 2018-12-16 18:05:06 'The west' will include whatever we think it should include.  How long do you think BC can last without shipping products across #Buffalo? Weeks? Months? Certainly not years. BC doesn't want to ship our oil because something something 'the whales', let's see how long that lasts.
9851 2018-12-16 18:05:01 Why do we continue to purchase oil from other countries when we have our own. Does not make any sense. Time to cut off transfer payments to Quebec and BC until the pipelines are built in both directions.
9852 2018-12-16 18:05:00 Sounds like tons of Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil today. Wish I was one 
9853 2018-12-16 18:04:58 I use the actual plant. It’s at Public’s for $2. I added vitamin E oil so it would last longer
9854 2018-12-16 18:04:57 Talk of rotting timbers on the Mary Rose inspired my husband to sand and oil our kitchen surfaces last night!
9855 2018-12-16 18:04:51 Me putting new oil filter on my car: “I should make sure it’s on super tight so it doesn’t leak or fall off”

Also me, struggling to take filter off at next oil change: “who the fuck put this fucking filter on so damn tight?!”
9856 2018-12-16 18:04:50 Quebec is getting 44% of its Oil from Alberta and even have bitumen processing but need another pipeline to get more which Quebec has refused
9857 2018-12-16 18:04:45 Why is target the only place that sells the type of motor oil I need for my car? Gas stations, you need to step it up.
9858 2018-12-16 18:04:43 I would have loved to see this conversation stay on the rails of respect, opening up the important topic of #ParisAgreement & @CPC_HQ.

A friend pointed out yesterday, that man made forest fires in BC emitted more C02 than all the Alberta Oil Sands did ... this year.
9859 2018-12-16 18:04:31 tbh my biggest tip is getting a good prescription. sometimes i’ve found some soothing in cbd oil, or a magnesium supplement (they sell some in powder form at centra market for u to mix in with ur bev)
9860 2018-12-16 18:04:26 Lucas Oil looks better with Drum Corps in it.
9861 2018-12-16 18:04:21 #ANGS Christmas tree is a great sign as it means there's pressure to contain which means oil and gas will be free flowing and they're working on a Sunday because they have to

9864 2018-12-16 18:04:14 I'll bet the oil fields of the north slope in Alaska are 2nd. Bunch of dudes working 2 weeks (or more) straight. Nothing better to do after work. Lol
9865 2018-12-16 18:04:08 @realDonaldTrump Please Mr Trump help the people from Venezuela scape 20 years of robbery and starvation!! Not only innocent children are dying of starvation but also the animals in the zoo... They are rich in oil but totally dominated by corrupt politicians! That's enough!!

9867 2018-12-16 18:03:55 TBH I don't care where Arsenal end this season I just want Man Utd to discover Oil
9868 2018-12-16 18:03:55 What was the oil price den
9869 2018-12-16 18:03:46 Not heard of it but sometimes use cbd oil and it chills me out a little in the night.
9870 2018-12-16 18:03:19 We were going to put her down tomorrow but decided until after Christmas. I have her on cannabis oil for her pain. I don't think I can do this. Pray for me to find the strength
9871 2018-12-16 18:03:14 palm oil doesnt either? lol
9872 2018-12-16 18:03:13 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.

9877 2018-12-16 18:02:46 Ha ha rahul becoming PM WIL BE THE GREATEST LOSS TO STALIN TO BECOME CM... AS RAHUL WITH DMK MP AT CENTER WITH HUGE OIL PRIZE IN 2021 and admk at state..

9878 2018-12-16 18:02:36 also has palm oil which while its not an animal product it damages the rainforests
9879 2018-12-16 18:02:35 So you like the fact they're nice guys. Hard to argue that but neither of them are going to push progressive policies. We will continue to swirl the drain unless we get leadership that has their priorities in order. 

Beto is second largest boot-licker to Big Oil and Gas. Pass!
9880 2018-12-16 18:02:33 I can see why - only question is lard or vegetable oil?
9881 2018-12-16 18:02:26 He’ll give any province a veto to strand Canadian oil.  Whatever it takes.  That’s the end game.
9882 2018-12-16 18:02:10 Do you think Trump removing regulations to bolster US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices shows intent to repay Putin for his help in getting elected?
9883 2018-12-16 18:02:09 All the Ex's do not matter. All their hands are bloody with Hebrew Biafra GENOCIDE for oil and gas. Globalist.
9884 2018-12-16 18:02:02 Went to a @Valvoline for the first time today for an oil change and was thoroughly impressed. Was done in 13 minutes, never had to leave the car, and staff didn’t try to sell me a bunch of extras.
9885 2018-12-16 18:02:00 Sorry just seen this, my daughter saw on fb that someone we know on coach 2 didn’t get back until 11pm. It’s bad enough if there’s no hold ups, did you go the season where there was an oil spillage on the motorway?
9886 2018-12-16 18:01:51 She’s my beard oil..

9888 2018-12-16 18:01:47 Ok. So are you his engine oil?
9889 2018-12-16 18:01:38 2 cups cooked/mashed SP.                3 eggs.                                                    4tbsp GF butter, ghee or coconut oil                                                            3tbsp coconut flour.

9891 2018-12-16 18:01:05 #Colts win the toss and defer. It’s game time at Lucas Oil Stadium.
9892 2018-12-16 18:01:00 A little more oil in my lamp I pray
9893 2018-12-16 18:00:56 Yeah and look at the waist-size and health of the "average" American.... Too many unhealthy trans-fats and "healthy" oils in the diet..and Cottonseed oil will just be as toxic to the body as Canola Oil.
9894 2018-12-16 18:00:55 From what? You are the that to Canadian values, trying to replicate that American snake oil here
9895 2018-12-16 18:00:51 UN: Who is going to shut down oil production in their country?

: No chance

: HaHaHa....

: You are crazy

: We are expanding

: We will! We will! Us first, we want to be “world leaders”!  Our people don’t need jobs - we just increased EI benefits!

9897 2018-12-16 18:00:49 Stupid ppl r attracted to snake oil. Marx said a lot of shit to make his method appealing to the anarchists w/in the International. "Stateless communism", labor being "life's prime want". The truth is the guy was a German nationalist & sold the exact vision that Lenin made real
9898 2018-12-16 18:00:46 Combine 1 pound gumbo with 2 quarts jelly / jam. Add Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve for brunch
9899 2018-12-16 18:00:45 @MMMNightShift if you don't know how to change a Tyre or check the oil level in your car you should not be allowed to drive.

9905 2018-12-16 18:00:13 Last time the Cowboys came to Lucas Oil, Jerry Jones winked at me in the tunnel and I delivered the game ball ... lol 

Unfortunately I won’t be at the game to deliver the game ball but it’s all good 
9906 2018-12-16 18:00:03 Minister, until our government can find an alternative fossil fuels, specifically Alberta oil, a carbon tax will only hurt hard working Canadians who are already burndened with high gas prices. We need to promote reliable fuel source for our climate, innovation, not taxation!
9907 2018-12-16 17:59:57 But which of the two options is it?
9908 2018-12-16 17:59:55 Um, Lucas Oil, this new entry system is NOT cool!!! A simple notice would have been nice! #DALvsIND
9909 2018-12-16 17:59:27 We have ample refining capacity.  We lack infrastructure to get the crude oil to said refinery.  Rather than send it in ships across the ocean from Saudi, we should sent it across our land in a PIPELINE.
9910 2018-12-16 17:59:23 An historian at the National Portrait Gallery in London has understaken a search for notes on the original oil re such claims. Such depictions were certified only when consistent with fact, he says, but there are many renditions of the two in Sentencing scenes like this one.
9911 2018-12-16 17:59:15 It’s a good feeling in Lucas Oil today!
9912 2018-12-16 17:59:11 I think we'd be lucky to battle with Wolves tbh mate. Enjoy battling it out with Oil FC
9913 2018-12-16 17:58:53 I’m curious why conservatives cont’ to spread a false narrative of Saudi oil in QC, instead of using the rise of domestic oil in that province as a political win? The transformation began while they were in power. 

Why is a lie more politically advantageous than a win? #cdnpoli
9914 2018-12-16 17:58:46 snowってほんとに可愛いか当てにならんよなー笑自信がある人はそもそもそういうツール使わなそうやし
9915 2018-12-16 17:58:35 Grill.. use the grill. Cover a roast “anything” with garlic, mustard, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper and olive oil   the day or two before...
9916 2018-12-16 17:58:23 Hot shower and lavender oil
9917 2018-12-16 17:58:23 #climatechange is a talking point, again. A few #Facts:
1. Solar panels are made from petroleum products.
2. Petroleum is oil.  
3. In order to make the petroleum used in solar panel manufacturing, the oil must be drilled.  

#FactsFirst #FactsMatter #justsayin
9918 2018-12-16 17:58:23 South Africa needs to be careful. If you start actually murdering white people in numbers.... Can you imagine what the Americans are going to do? 

They will be there dropping freedom bombs like you found oil or something.
9919 2018-12-16 17:58:22 The baby oil
9920 2018-12-16 17:58:14 Not unlike the “thank and oilfield worker” campaign, they don’t want you to take a drive out to a drilling rig and shake everyone’s have with a box of donuts, but to maybe give them a break and realize that everyone uses oil and gas...
9921 2018-12-16 17:58:12 Most pancake mixes require a lot of additional ingredients. Add: eggs, oil & milk, you might as well have made the pancakes from scratch.

9923 2018-12-16 17:58:04 Job done at Anfield. Time for the #Colts to do the biz at Lucas Oil against the Cowboys. Strong passing game and a good defence to take us 8-6 and keep the play-off dream alive! #GOCOLTS
9924 2018-12-16 17:58:03 why buy me beard oil for christmas when you can be my beard oil.. for FREE
9925 2018-12-16 17:57:41 Has anyone in the @GDATF. Tried using CBD oil to help with anxiety and replacement medication side effects? I just started and already feeling and seeing amazing results. DM me if you would like more information!!
9926 2018-12-16 17:57:22 dinner at 2545h lmaorz  .. trying to remember when e last time i zombie-ate quite like this was  haha (noteself pls buy onions+garlic w) ((also this close to asking my local (town, not island) pokego group if anyone/'s folks do/es their own shallot or garlic oil &ifcanbuy, lols))
9927 2018-12-16 17:57:18 How is it misleading if it says it’s where Quebec gets their oil?  NB can’t get oil from Canada as readily and has gone on record to say it will continue to import.
9928 2018-12-16 17:57:07 How bout we demand them to either stop importing foreign oil , or forfeit eq payments ? Or maybe suppprt Energy East ? It’s a bit hypocritical don’t you think ?
9929 2018-12-16 17:57:00 Great to see quotes from 2016, an attempt to understand oil industry, little late however
9930 2018-12-16 17:56:54 Back in the day, government guys were awfully palsy with the oil executives.  Jus' saying.
9931 2018-12-16 17:56:51 being home for the holidays is so nice because there r more people around to help u if u need it. like, for example, i asked my dad to bring me some makeup remover and he brought me tanning oil instead
9932 2018-12-16 17:56:43 I'm a member of neither 

The greens worry me with plans for keeping the oil under the sea

And the SSP worried me with some of the space cadet Rise candidates they offered for election
9933 2018-12-16 17:56:39 Potatoes are in the oven.  Olive oil, garlic powder, spice mix and some grated Parmesan cheese.  There might be some gouda to finish it off when done cooking.

9937 2018-12-16 17:56:05 No no no. You are overlooking the obvious fact that England would suffer great financial hardship if they were not subsidising Scotland so much. All those oil, whisky and Salmon subsidies add up you know!

9941 2018-12-16 17:55:44 It's the most likely outcome. What happens to animals trapped in oil spills? What is it that kills the furry ones, aside from the fact that that oil is toxic, unlike olive oil? Her heart was in the right place. She wasn't "wrong". She was misguided and ignorant.
9942 2018-12-16 17:55:35 US has annexed Syrias oil fields  before Putin could

9944 2018-12-16 17:55:11 Because the price of crude oil , our mono product has dipped in the spot market.
9945 2018-12-16 17:55:06 I try to make myself feel better about mine by adding coconut oil to the mix.
9946 2018-12-16 17:55:03 Alberta sold out DECADES ago. The blame sits squarely on their shoulders for NOT doing oil right. EVER
9947 2018-12-16 17:55:01 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions,But they do not all pop at the same time..My people, never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come

9948 2018-12-16 17:54:59 bring it on baby get the oil out and we will fight
9949 2018-12-16 17:54:48 Does your canada include using make in canada oil? Or just Saudi ones?
9950 2018-12-16 17:54:48 Again, if the #Colts (7-6) win their final 3 games they have a very, very good chance to make the playoffs.

Next hurdle is the Cowboys (8-5) now from Lucas Oil Stadium.

9952 2018-12-16 17:54:41 So I'm not an 'oil fixes everything' person, but hot damn this lavender oil mixed in with my topical benedryl makes a measurable difference compared to benedryl alone!
9953 2018-12-16 17:54:33 For gods sake Michael, change the oil in that hat.
9954 2018-12-16 17:54:33 That Oil E Mf
9955 2018-12-16 17:54:28 SNOWでいじり倒した原型ないやん
みたいなんやで、だいたい自撮り晒してるのなんか………
9956 2018-12-16 17:54:22 I bought oil paint and mini canvases
I'm gonna paint some dicks yeet
9957 2018-12-16 17:54:21 That discount is costing Canada almost $80 million per day.  Building pipelines to tidewater opens up the entire world market for Canadian oil.
9958 2018-12-16 17:54:17 I got so much to do! Oil change first!
9959 2018-12-16 17:54:11 Name me a Tory one that has been good for the economy, thatcher had the luck to have North Sea oil and gas to cover up her assult on our economy apart from the last dubious labour one most labour governments had a lot to deal with, to be fair, so did the Tory ones.
9960 2018-12-16 17:54:06 Let's face it... renewables are off the table. Especially when this place is set up for oil & gas extraction, and refining. There's just nothing in it financially in the long term provincially or federally. It's going to take the peoples to make the change they'd like to see!
9961 2018-12-16 17:53:51 Hypocrisy is a word that is being used an awful lot lately
And in most instances it's used wrong..
It's not hypocrisy when someone changes their mind.

It's hypocrisy when a politician says that oil is bad and but accepts donations from oil companies at the same time.
9962 2018-12-16 17:53:45 trimmed my ends, did a deep condition and hot oil treatment the other day and my curls were so pretty
9963 2018-12-16 17:53:42 No water, soap, detergent. Scrub w/salt + teaspoon of bicarb. Wipe out residue w/unflavored cooking oil (debate ensues) ya’ll have my dead grans spinning in their graves, as my 50+yrs old cast iron skillet escapes from the cupboard & smashes an escape thru the kitchen widow.
9964 2018-12-16 17:53:35 like to oil them two up..don't want them rifles to rust...

9966 2018-12-16 17:53:35 Ontario NEVER hears about oil. I was recently told by an Ontarian that y'all 'heard stories' about the devastation wreaked on the prairies by PTv1.0 Let me know when actual news of the prairies reaches you. Shouldn't be more than a decade or so
9967 2018-12-16 17:53:18 Debunk what?

That she pushed it all over the world as SOS?

We just know the next “Hillary” is going to be the same bundled bag of bullshit that will still shill for banking, oil & gas, private health insurance & all the industries standing in the way of real progressive policy.
9968 2018-12-16 17:53:14 I saw some recipes they put canola oil in it from Jamaica
9969 2018-12-16 17:52:55 Sorry, been there. Try taking some herbal supplements: black cohosh, biotin, evening primrose oil...
9970 2018-12-16 17:52:51 What’s a veg oil diet?
9971 2018-12-16 17:52:32 Why are there so many Cowboys fans at Lucas Oil smdh
9972 2018-12-16 17:52:26 no way you can tell me that alternative medicine isn’t the way to go. you’re telling me i can rub this oil on my body and my pain goes away instantly?!? yea we out here
9973 2018-12-16 17:52:25 You youngsters been smokin’ too much of that phish oil...
9974 2018-12-16 17:52:23 Several things here are listed more than once, presumably to make the list look longer than it actually is. Several things listed can be made without petro chemicals if we needed to. Some of the things listed are incredibly vague ("toys" who knew wooden blocks were made of oil?)
9975 2018-12-16 17:52:23 You can’t fake oil, anointing or fruit. It’s a process on top of a process. It’s not accumulated over night. Promotion comes from God not man.
9976 2018-12-16 17:52:21 We open for your shopping convenience @ Noon today.  Join me for blood orange olive oil brownies.
9977 2018-12-16 17:52:19 Very loud cheers here at Lucas Oil as the Cowboys take the field. I assume this date was circled by every Cowboy fan that lives in the Midwest. #cowboyswire
9978 2018-12-16 17:52:13 @VassyKapelos Can you please discuss the emissions being release by using train and truck to transport oil vs a pipeline.  There are more pollutants with transport.  Also the risk to people is greater in transport to pipeline.  Look at the train derailment in Que. 2013.
9979 2018-12-16 17:52:09 A 2 team league back then plus didn't come up against Arab oil money a lot easier back then
9980 2018-12-16 17:52:08 Roar goes up here at Lucas Oil Stadium . . . and it's the Cowboys running on the field. Lots of Dallas fans here.
9981 2018-12-16 17:52:06 Mines and their deadly poisonous tailing ponds is only one. Runoff into rivers kill fish and evetything else. 
Tarsands dirty oil ponds kill thousands of birds.
9982 2018-12-16 17:52:02 Oil and vinegar hippy
9983 2018-12-16 17:52:01 What? Proud of Canada  in BC. I’ve heard some Albertan’s aren’t happy since oil prices dropped. Nothing we can really do about that. Sorry 
9984 2018-12-16 17:51:53 Its their oil that goes in all of the cars 
9985 2018-12-16 17:51:52 Loooootta Cowboys fans in Lucas Oil today
9986 2018-12-16 17:51:45 Yes they r n they cook it very well no spices no oil
9987 2018-12-16 17:51:35 Suck on it oil car companies
9988 2018-12-16 17:51:34 Saudi is a very small player in our foreign oil purchases.
9989 2018-12-16 17:51:29 i ate pasta and i feel like the olive oil added to my general physical discomfort today. i feel like i should've eaten just... leafs
9990 2018-12-16 17:51:28 Lots, and lots, and lots of Cowboys fans here at Lucas Oil today.
9991 2018-12-16 17:51:23 The US$ also faces the looming threat of a world no longer dependent on oil but instead run on electricity. Trumps idiotic myopia is causing America to be left behind as others seek forward thinking policies.
9992 2018-12-16 17:51:10 That is GB's 3rd different men's rider to place on the podium in the omnium this #TissotUCITrackWC season. Oil Wood and Mark Stewart both placed 2nd in a round. So much depth in the omnium all around. 10 different riders have been on the podium across 4 rounds.
9993 2018-12-16 17:50:40 Termine en fuel oil ayer, nada que ver
9994 2018-12-16 17:50:35 #MUFC are so, so ordinary. Another week of players tweeting about "fighting" to get the right result beckons. Liverpool play with a sense of excitement. United play with fear. You can sign noodle and car oil endorsements to beat the band. All means nothing if you can't compete.
9995 2018-12-16 17:50:34 CBD oil helps.

9998 2018-12-16 17:50:15 Dey said we lost jobs in 3years,FG nd states didn't sack,banks didn't do mass sack,oil companies didnt,no factory reported closed since 2015,Dangote didnt.Where are jobs lost?
Atiku doubled his works force from 50,000 to 100,000. We should confront them wit accurate fig and data
9999 2018-12-16 17:50:09 Trust the oil on your life. Don’t let the depth scare you, discernment is developed there. 

God has secret provision for the ones who believe and obey.

10003 2018-12-16 17:49:37 And remember millennials, Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves in the world.
And even with these oil reserves, Venezuela is broke
10004 2018-12-16 17:49:36 If natural twitter can chime in.. black Castor oil helps hair grow in general so it should work
10005 2018-12-16 17:49:31 They always present the worst example.
Venezuela’s in this mess because their oil exports dried up and the guys running the government have been dictators.
10006 2018-12-16 17:49:09 oh!イル
10007 2018-12-16 17:49:08 Most of their oil comes from the US...given the current state of things, this isn't any better than Saudi IMO.
10008 2018-12-16 17:48:48 US$ based on oil being oil sold in dollars. Trumps bad behavior is causing a massive shift to replace it with a Chinese gold based currency. Say goodbye to unlimited national debt and hello to an era of austerity.

10016 2018-12-16 17:48:22 @realDonaldTrump - a true leader would leave a legacy to be revered. But, Jeffrey Sachs accurately sums you up thus... "It's not a matter of belief or denial. It's a matter of putting oil and coal company — and country — interests above the interests of all of humanity.” #climate
10017 2018-12-16 17:48:16 apparently i put too much oregano oil in my new humidifier/oil diffuser because now the whole room just smells like pizza. send help
10018 2018-12-16 17:48:10 How are you going to whine about "open borders" eroding sovereignty (not true) when your entire economy depends on getting oil and gas to foreign market?

How does being completely and utterly dependent on fossil fuels to attract foreign dollars make you more sovereign, exactly?
10019 2018-12-16 17:47:55 The Saudi oil goes to the Irving refinery in NB.
10020 2018-12-16 17:47:54 If Canada is going to tell Alberta how to ship it’s oil then Alberta should be able to tell Canada how it should spend any money from Alberta oil revenues.
10021 2018-12-16 17:47:54 HAHAHHA US IN CARLE HALL PULLING OIL AS IF IT WAS THE MIRACLE CURR TO CRIPPLING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY

マスクしたらだいたいみんなかわいく見えるしね(*^_^*)
10023 2018-12-16 17:47:50 Actually the Saudi oil comes to Canada from Alberta. But don't tell anyone, big secret, much of the patch is owned by NOT CANADIANS
10024 2018-12-16 17:47:48 Oil not ....... 
10025 2018-12-16 17:47:46 Energy East would allow 1.1 billion barrels a day to be sent to Canadian east coast refineries.  This would eliminate a need to help import all foreign oil.  It would improve Canada’s GDP, and provide healthy interdependence between eastern and western provinces.
10026 2018-12-16 17:47:46 My goodness, tea tree oil has a strong smell.
10027 2018-12-16 17:47:38 早くヘッドセット買い替えなきゃなぁ
10028 2018-12-16 17:47:35 @Valvoline oil change 12/12. Flat tire 12/13. @Valvoline says valve stem busted, should be easy fix. Tire shop says someone was too aggressive with their air hose, stem unfixable, need new tire. $130! That tire wasn’t even 1.5 yrs old! 
10029 2018-12-16 17:47:32 so you don’t wash off the oil you just leave it in??? also thank you so much
10030 2018-12-16 17:47:23 Not to mention his indebting us to a foreign power, undermining faith in financial institutions, & our ability to repay=higher interest rates, higher prices in food.

Losing the US$ as oil reserve, while being weakened with debt, =US greatly disadvantaged to debt holder.
10031 2018-12-16 17:47:22 Who has taken over your body and mind?

Zinke and the Pipeline killing off salmon and Orcas..? Trashing your tourist business. Find an industry to replace oil, will ya?
10032 2018-12-16 17:47:21 Chef Kawasaki cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.
10033 2018-12-16 17:47:19 So Ilnur Cevik who had important political role in the Turkish invasion of #Afrin & now northeast Syria via crafting policy & contact with foreign diplomats (which paved the way for the military invasion) has major business interests in #Kurdistan, including in the oil sector.
10034 2018-12-16 17:46:49 With idiotic opinions like that, I can see why you only have 30 followers. You are good with Canadians, you included, losing $80M a day? You think oil trains are better than pipelines? Classic AB hater. The sheer amount of these haters means it is truly #timetogo
