1 2018-10-04 23:59:18 @realWillStanton they gave us two meetings. The first on how they are not giving us a raise because we make a competitive wage when we add the 5 stocks we get after working 2 years and in our productivity bonus. The second on how they were giving us a raise to 15 without previous
2 2018-10-04 23:58:47 Amazon stocks keep dropping. I’m telling you. Making our pay $15 was a huge mistake.
3 2018-10-04 23:55:55 Big facts! Your chances of having the funds for those investments are higher when you put your money into a few stocks here and there. Just gotta know what you’re putting your money into.

7 2018-10-04 23:49:20 Arguably North got the best season out of Greenwood then sold him when his stocks were highest. I would argue his output since has not hurt North massively. Reckon Kelly’s loss might sting Geelong more.

9 2018-10-04 23:48:03 I wonder how many congressmen and congresswomen own gun stocks? Every time there is a mass shooting gun stocks go up. Profit over people. Follow the money.

So. Begs the question. Does the ROW ‘catch up’ to the US or the US ‘sink down’ to the ROW?

45 2018-10-04 23:37:43 This sort of gun control is outdated/outmoded. Bump stocks can and will be 3D printed. Carry on.

48 2018-10-04 23:35:50 Shorts actually keep stocks from becoming too overpriced. This is why the shortselling became legal; to keep stocks from becoming overpriced when they shouldn’t. Overpriced companies create bubbles that will lead to many investors losing their assets when the bubbles burst.

50 2018-10-04 23:35:06 Shouldn't be buying stocks when you are treading water. It is called an investment, you are supposed to use surplus money, not gamble.
51 2018-10-04 23:34:57 It’s like if you pull the top ten companies by market cap you get an R-squared of around .95 depending on timeframe. Question the benefits of owning a ton of stocks sometimes.

57 2018-10-04 23:31:49 The reason why a lot of us are stressing out about preorders is because SM doesn’t overproduce so we constantly have to worry about not having enough stocks. We have 28 days left to preorder but tomorrow SM will determine just how many albums they’ll produce. @weareoneEXO #EXO
58 2018-10-04 23:29:44 What about when they say you dont need bump stocks?
59 2018-10-04 23:28:44 Many involved in the stock market are profiting and that's Great. Those of us that have no stocks are profiting too. Workers have job security and higher paying jobs. Stocks and jobs sometimes go hand in hand.God bless the USA and the world.

63 2018-10-04 23:27:11 These morons say the stock market is not the economy and then when stocks dip 1% start talking about economic problems.
64 2018-10-04 23:27:03 Why take bonuses and stocks away? Appalling bait and switch. Not nearly enough. Try again. You are killing our middle class and our retail stores. You owe us, your country, your workers (who earn you the money you're hoarding), much more.
65 2018-10-04 23:26:00 First day since July 3rd that more S&P 500 stocks are oversold than overbought.
66 2018-10-04 23:25:23 Is it bad that a disproportionate amount of stocks are having lows and the large ones have been propping up the market?
67 2018-10-04 23:24:36 If the market gets bad the high valuation stocks often get hit the hardest and it's trading at over 80x 2019 earnings
68 2018-10-04 23:23:52 Stocks hit the crapper today
69 2018-10-04 23:23:11 Actually, dem spending injects *real* money into *real* people's pockets, hence we avoided another great depression ppl had money to spend. Would have climbed out faster w/o R interference. R spending goes to corporations to buy back stocks. $ hoarded, taken out of the economy.
70 2018-10-04 23:23:08 @MomentumAdvice What are some reputable sites to buy stocks through without going through the major stock companies?
71 2018-10-04 23:23:07 Well he's implementing disastrous economic policies like the tariffs that often take some time to hit the economy. The tax breaks for corporations just let them buy back stocks so it'll be interesting once they market settles
72 2018-10-04 23:23:03 It’s interesting how global stocks all went up and down together until @realDonaldTrump started putting America first!

81 2018-10-04 23:13:55 Nope but he won’t be there forever. Pence is really the stickler and Trump needs those evangelicals. I really don’t see them asking about stocks though. And if I say no, I’m not invested, how will they prove I am? It’s a waste of time to try to prove I am.
82 2018-10-04 23:12:46 I like shooting guns but nobody needs an AR 15 or bump stocks or high capacity magazines.The NRA has lost a lot of it's power. Officers of the NRA may have some illegal ties to Russia.

84 2018-10-04 23:11:38 If only the stockmarket was the only part of the economy. And if only companies weren't artificially inflating the market by buying their own stocks back.

96 2018-10-04 23:01:33 It's October, so as expected, a bunch of stocks are in the red. So bizarre how it happens pretty much yearly. Some years worse than others.
97 2018-10-04 23:01:14 If you need the monthly cash flow to fund your life-style, your yields are important. Who wants to sell their favorite stocks?
98 2018-10-04 23:00:49 I love innovation. I also love finding under and over valued stocks. $TSLA is simply way way over valued. It’s simple math.
99 2018-10-04 23:00:39 Lol I know this is hyperbole but imagine if Trump ends up being Hoover.  He also wasn’t a politician, w/a biz background, he started with the tariffs and stocks roared in the beginning of his term.  And infrastructure projects!  You know Trump wants to put his name on something!

104 2018-10-04 22:59:37 Stocks for beer probably at an all time high right now. I am drinking to this
105 2018-10-04 22:59:36 Shorting over-valued stocks creates value by reducing the wealth companies and insiders can extract from shareholders. Removing capital from unproductive uses is a good thing.
106 2018-10-04 22:59:30 Oddly, it is both. Stocks like the banks, telcos and utilities are absurdly cheap. Yield on $BCE.CA is close to 6% which is more than 2x the 10 yr bond. So value is absolutely there. Question is, will anyone buy in? Probably eventually patience will win out.
107 2018-10-04 22:59:08 Their stock was getting so high that it was actually cheaper for them to just give the people a pay raise (and ditch the stocks).

What's happening to our King Salmon stocks?

117 2018-10-04 22:53:10 If you truly love what Tesla does, buy stocks. If you're just in for the money, find another stock! You'll be needing a strong stomach to invest in Tesla.
118 2018-10-04 22:52:14 Agree his production will be hard to replace, but best to sell stocks when they're high though right. This league hasn't embraced that part of player movement yet. There seems to be a reluctance to roll an asset on for further assets as per NBA
119 2018-10-04 22:49:28 They volatile af if you invest in them you have to watch them constantly before they start to dip. They have penny stocks that are as cheap as 1/4th of a penny.
120 2018-10-04 22:48:05 I’m all for new stocks but I think they’ll go right back to the dead this way. One roll of Ektachrome is $53 for XXL scans at IFL vs. $35 for B&W.

I’m happy if there are people who don’t care and support it. I won’t.

127 2018-10-04 22:40:44 To the people who use "prophetic insight" to guide them in buying stocks or cryptocurrencies, well, it sounds more like the Egyptian arts of divination than anything from God. At least to me.
128 2018-10-04 22:39:30 a good argument for not allowing people to buy or sell stocks
129 2018-10-04 22:39:07 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @TheJusticeDept People are not stupid : They realize Cable TV Financial charlatans push+pull stocks in collusion w/ Shorters & make huge profits, they keep stock prices unchanged for 20 minutes,etc. Very sad in this great country this scam goes on daily !

139 2018-10-04 22:31:00 Isn't he saying ”for gods sake get out of debt now we've given you so much warning. Just Do It!” Just as Obama or was it Bush? said at the 2009 low ”Buy stocks now”
140 2018-10-04 22:30:50 That's what it looked like to me.

145 2018-10-04 22:30:07 Would've loved to buy at $29 but barely out of college then, worked couple years, wife got sick with Guillain-Barre June 2013. Wasn't quite looking at stocks. Upset because if it wasn't for tweets and bs very likely would've been ATH now, not same price as 3 years ago.

150 2018-10-04 22:27:09 "Funds can be allocated from investments, not taxes." - whose investments? Florida (or any state) does not invest in stocks or whatever to create revenue. Plus, investments have risks. And if FL did have investment income why would it be earmarked for canals? Clueless.

152 2018-10-04 22:25:21 Today’s weird interaction is an excited Yugoslavian man stopping me on the street to tell me his stocks went up, meanwhile the sound of someone practicing the trumpet can be heard. It’s 8:20am and I’m too sleepy for this
153 2018-10-04 22:25:07 Maybe you should invest your life savings into meme stocks you hear about on reddit
154 2018-10-04 22:24:48 Wtf are you doing investing your life savings? These are stocks, not a casino You can't blame anyone but yourself. It's called "yo' fault" disease
155 2018-10-04 22:24:34 My new fetish is faking business phone calls on planes while using vaguely incorrect jargon around people who would likely know the correct usage of the jargon I’m using. Just ordered my imaginary phone person to “swap the stocks with the Wichita branch immediately”

160 2018-10-04 22:21:37 It goes beyond "real use". Stocks represent ownership of companies offering products/services with real use. Stocks offer dividends. Yet most tank in a recession. "Real use" does not suffice.

169 2018-10-04 22:16:55 Tech stocks were hit with news that China infiltrated leading companies', including Apple and Amazon, supply chains by implanting a spy chip in their servers. Both companies, denied the claim.
170 2018-10-04 22:15:27 You think there will be a squeeze on MJ stocks leading up to 10/17? The last two weeks have been brutal for them, especially CRON, seems like a sell the news event. They are due for a good PR, a surge in volume with good PR could potentially get it to test 14-15
171 2018-10-04 22:15:26 Middle class and Poor people can not afford stocks.  Nothing extra in our paychecks. So who cares
172 2018-10-04 22:14:44 Be my guest! It's about polish politics. Right now a very sad, irritating and painful story. Just about right for an unhackable password . Investing and watching others picking stocks (like you) calms my nerves. :) I really like following your tweets!

178 2018-10-04 22:12:05 @jimcramer so you are saying this is the beginning of the downturn in stocks?
179 2018-10-04 22:11:37 Bro today was a bloodbath on my stocks. Looked like the red wedding
180 2018-10-04 22:11:09 You on fire!!!!!! I am still upset about $prtk though.. completely went against what stocks usually do post approval. $ttph and $akao fell hard and this guy... played the reverse especially on a bad day as today.

188 2018-10-04 22:06:41 they’re taking away VCP which is a tremendous help during the holidays, they’re starting a new stocks program that no like likes for some reason, and people who’ve been here for 5+ years are only getting $1.25 raise while newbies start @ $15
189 2018-10-04 22:06:37 US Stocks may lead. The US President couldn’t lead newborn ducks. Instead of leading, he divides this country.
190 2018-10-04 22:04:32 What was the point of studying #finance? Everything in this market is opposite from what I learned... #stocks is the safety trade in a #bond market with rising yields and #gold is actually a thing. Guess you live and learn.
191 2018-10-04 22:03:49 It clearly states that a watch on valuations is about to occur, meaning stocks are overvalued.  There will be a correction.  It’s right there in the fucking graph,  you report bs, never getting to the heart of an issue, obstructing, diverting, etc.  THIS IS A WARNING.  SELL
192 2018-10-04 22:03:11

194 2018-10-04 22:02:27 Not all stocks cost that much, and allot of people don't stay in the same spot forever, they move up if they earn it
195 2018-10-04 22:02:13 Once you learn technical analysis of single stocks, how would you go about learning the intermarket relationships?
196 2018-10-04 22:01:51 It's OK. JRM's got our back. He said that the effects of Brexit can be offset with stocks, bonds, savings, inheritances etc. So he'll obviously be handing out his to those who need help if we leave.
197 2018-10-04 22:00:55 Yep Amazon knew their stocks have been rising and their image has been getting hammered because of low pay and bad conditions. So announce the 15 per hour the day before they take bonus and stock options. Total scum bag corporate move made for pr and screwing the wage slaves.

203 2018-10-04 21:58:09 You know? Because Obama making and over taxing the rich for those social programs. Forcing businesses to sell stocks and move production overseas. Which meant job loss and people being laid and forced to accept government help.

211 2018-10-04 21:55:52 Yes. Makes me sick that people see stocks as just a way to enrich their bottom line. They are a vote of support, not a tool for speculation. Life is about more than money. Perservere @elonmusk Some of us get it.
212 2018-10-04 21:55:21 Yes sir!!!!!! 
213 2018-10-04 21:55:19 Earlier than January 2015, excuse me. I also became heavily involved into stocks, trading, & finance. I then studied why stocks (in theory) go down. I then realized that the entire stock market is rigged, and concluded the only way to fix it was by influencing voters. @ACLU @CIA

217 2018-10-04 21:53:12 With USG borrowing like drunken Kavanaugh rates bound to go up! I doubt even Fed can restrain them even though Trump wants the Fed to do exactly the same! Yes I liquidated my treasuries ETF SHY today. MM funds better than SHY. Also stocks better than bonds!
218 2018-10-04 21:52:50 55%of Americans have no stocks at all they have poor wages,poor housing(if their lucky to have a home )and poor medical care if any the infrastructure is a mess the vet's are left to deal with  mental problems and your education is a mess your kids did from drugs or bullets MAGA?
219 2018-10-04 21:52:31 Your distroying the World Economy. It is expected. World rich also have a lot of money invested in American Stock. When they pull, Stocks will fall more. Stock down today
220 2018-10-04 21:52:29 Guess you didn’t see the warning. Stocks are over valued and just like you they will come crashing down.
221 2018-10-04 21:51:37 HE DOESN'T NEED TO HELP TO PAY FOR ANYTHING. HE HAS ENOUGH. 50 TIMES OVER ENOUGH. CASH. OUT. SOME. STOCKS. @JeffBezos
222 2018-10-04 21:51:16 Nah that doesn’t make sense....corporate buybacks are merely companies obtaining loans and using them to buy back shares of their stocks to inflate their market cap. They wouldn’t give it to their workers...further more this further highlights another layer of exploitation.
223 2018-10-04 21:50:32 Investing in stocks when you can "barely keep your head above water" was a bad idea.

228 2018-10-04 21:48:54 A PSA to everyone in here flipping their desks or hiding under them:

Don’t put money into stocks if you
A) can’t survive losing it,
And,
B) want it back quickly.

And if you have: Hang on to your investments and your hats. You’ll be fine.
229 2018-10-04 21:48:29 Thinking about buying into pot stocks in Canada.
230 2018-10-04 21:47:37 Crypto currency good or just a loose fairy tale. I'd say if trump has stocks in it it must mean something.
231 2018-10-04 21:47:08 Tiger woods was dropped when he was involved during the scandal he had. Nike's stocks will go down if they support him if it's proved that he is guilty.
232 2018-10-04 21:46:52 Your employees work in Silicon Valley, they could find many companies whose stocks could double in a year. If your stock is constantly hurt by you, you will have difficulty keeping or find new employees, as company stock maybe they rely on to make life better.
233 2018-10-04 21:46:49 I watched your Does the Market care about stocks" video, it was interesting but your back & forth on scenarios that cause a market top (yields)/52 week highs) made me glad I just buy and hold and not market time - it was over my head lol
234 2018-10-04 21:46:12 what stocks do you love right now?
235 2018-10-04 21:46:06 True! And Tesla has AMAZING products! But what if people who rely on their company stocks to maintain life style have to leave because the company stock gets hammered in short term?
236 2018-10-04 21:46:04 I'm in high school, I own stocks, and my parents are far from rich... Check your facts
237 2018-10-04 21:45:37 Today in 1996 tech stocks fell AND Barnes & Noble gained... No, wait... that was today in 2018 #whereAmI #crazytown
238 2018-10-04 21:45:25 True investors always love their favorite stocks going lower, because they can buy more. This is exactly what I am doing. TSLA is a rare gift. It's so rare I don't remember ever seen something like this.
239 2018-10-04 21:45:11 Not if the stocks crash into the ground tho. Because then your value is down

241 2018-10-04 21:44:40 My portfolio compared to what it was under Obama is all the proof I need. So sorry if your stocks aren't doing well...Mine are doing great, and I couldn't be happier.
242 2018-10-04 21:44:36 Don’t put money into stocks if you
A) can’t survive losing it,
And,
B) want it back quickly.

What about this is difficult?

He is a politician, the thing is to please whoever is asking the question.

250 2018-10-04 21:42:33 You are really helping the shorts by showing you could not control yourself. Even if you don’t care about your shareholders, think about your employees. They have tsla stocks and could not stand your constant damage to its prices by feeding the shorts through your stupid behavior
251 2018-10-04 21:40:59 Yes that is part of it. More the clear accumulation of growth stocks as they breakout of defined consolidation patterns.

258 2018-10-04 21:35:54 I simply believe most of the big money investment world -- is of a disbelief mindset. Energy stocks are massively underowned. 
The world view is permanent disinflation, and that rates will never go up -- it's been that way so many years.
259 2018-10-04 21:35:47 I sure hope you are right this time around, that this is the biggest bubble of them all...so we can pick up cheap stocks and cheap homes. Cash is waiting, ready to go.

298 2018-10-04 21:21:26 A small position. Been debating what to do. The problem is it will obviously be purely news driven. No news and the stock probably becomes stagnant. But once the cat is out of the bag (assuming it does happen) it’s too late. It’s one of the stocks that’ll gap up and be gone

301 2018-10-04 21:20:40 Yeah, you are probably right. But, seriously, your tweeting only HELPS the shorts. How do I know? Everytime you do it, stocks loses values, makes money for the shorts.
So, stay quiet or focus on product only for a while and let's see what happens. I know shorts would hate it.
302 2018-10-04 21:20:35 Amazon workers in my state didn't ask for $15 because here they already pay $15 or more, plus incentive pay, stocks, healthcare. But now Bezos took away all of that away. So workers here took a paycut. Everything was fine w/pay until Bernie got involved & Bezos fooled him.
303 2018-10-04 21:20:21 Better: Swapping bonds for “cash” alters the private sector’s portfolio mix. More bonds, less cash. Market can’t collectively change Q of cash. So bond (and equity) prices, hence total stocks of each, adjust. Preferred portfolio balance is restored.

312 2018-10-04 21:17:37 The best part of The Tweet is the implication that because someone shorts stocks they must be evil. As if being short a stock is a worse crime that running a multi-billion dollar fraud.

317 2018-10-04 21:15:25 Months ago, it was highlighted the greatest valuation disparity between value stocks like energy, and concept / tech stocks...since the major top in 2000.  Which means, ever.

325 2018-10-04 21:11:45 Most retirement accounts invested in stocks. Anyone who wants to retire anytime worries about markets. Affects real estate market too, if people lose money in markets, they have less to pay for R.E. Less equity is loss of wealth. Big runup helps the rich. Losses hurt everybody.

389 2018-10-04 20:43:14 Do you even read these things? "Rally prompts warning on valuations" meaning all that buyback of stocks instead of investment is falsely elevating the value of these stocks.

393 2018-10-04 20:38:36 Wtf happened with the stocks today!?
394 2018-10-04 20:36:25 Deploreables love citing stock market run up as signs of Trumps positive impact on economy--I havent heard them complain about how increasing interest rates are going to crush real estate value--I guess because typical Deploreable is heavy into stocks but doesnt own a home right?
395 2018-10-04 20:36:20 who the fuck is scraeming "SELL THE COMMON" at my house. show yourself, coward. i will never short stocks
396 2018-10-04 20:35:56 Fun fact: 84% of US stocks are owned by the richest 10% of Americans. 

Sorry, everyone else -- you're being left behind. 

MAGA = a Minority of Americans Getting Ahead.
397 2018-10-04 20:35:07 Stocks fucked me all up today  ...
398 2018-10-04 20:33:31 Your base must be rubbing their hands with glee at the hundreds of thoisands they have made trading stocks...oh wait...no, hardly any of your base have ANY investments whatsoever. Try being a president for once, the USA is more than a stock market valuation.
399 2018-10-04 20:33:10 IOW, "crashing" stocks to save USTs won't work.  "Crashing" stocks will increase UST supplies significantly, while simultaneously reducing the only UST buyers' (US private sector) ability to buy USTs.  In next big selloff, most will be surprised to watch TLT sell off w/stocks.
400 2018-10-04 20:32:48 Yeah because stocks aren’t overly saturated from stock buybacks or anything.
401 2018-10-04 20:32:23 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $COTY, $INCY, $AKAM, $MCHP, and $RL.
402 2018-10-04 20:32:18 JUST IN: U.S. stocks in broad retreat as bond yields rise. S&P 500 on track for worst session in 3 months. Stocks fell sharply on Thursday as interest rates hit new multiyear highs, dampening investor sentiment. U.S. stock market is headed for a decline in the range of 8% to 13%.
403 2018-10-04 20:31:54 The problem is that thanks to changes in US econ since Clinton Admin, for the 1st time ever, if stocks fall, US deficits will rise as fast or faster as consumer spending & tax receipts drop.  Saw this in Feb when TLT sold off w/sharp sell-off in stocks = Fed is cornered.
404 2018-10-04 20:31:14 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $STZ, $LLY, $JEF. $COG, and $CME.
405 2018-10-04 20:31:08 You do know stocks have been going up at the same rate for the past 10 year and it has only help the top 20%.  The bottom 80% would like to know why there real income has gone down. Can you explain?
406 2018-10-04 20:31:04 Dodged a bullet today with all these stocks down $tsla $vtvt $igc $hsgx.
Took the day off going over charts and hanging with fam! Hope everyone stayed safe!
407 2018-10-04 20:30:29 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD. $GE, $BAC, $F, and $MU.

410 2018-10-04 20:28:57 Stocks are up, real wages are stagnant. Tell me why I should care about how much more money the wealthy are getting.
411 2018-10-04 20:28:34 U.S. stocks ended sharply lower Thursday as U.S. Treasury yields continued their climb to multi-year highs on latest round of strong economic data, building concerns for an acceleration of inflation.
412 2018-10-04 20:28:25 Thanks. Not seen marriages one, but my Waitrose only stocks the #gf self raising flour that contains buckwheat. The Schar flour didn’t give the same results as the Sainsbury’s one. Not bothered just for us, but it’s for sons birthday party & needs to feed non #freefrom kids.
413 2018-10-04 20:27:50 $COST is another one of those stocks that had a "good chart".  Until now.  Too bad its not worth the price.  Dump.

415 2018-10-04 20:24:50 That's great of less than 50% of the people, who own or are invested in stocks. Otherwise, it benefits the rich, corporations and speculators.  Stock market numbers are not a true economic indicator
416 2018-10-04 20:24:27 Perhaps other countries could keep pace if they gave massive, debt-accelerating tax cuts to corporations so they could drive up the market by buying their own damn stocks back with the unwarranted windfall they received. you know, just like what the GOP & you idiotically did.
417 2018-10-04 20:23:43 Okay I have good news and bad news, bad news is that store no longer stocks that product, good news is I found a store close by that does! London East Dulwich Local is currently showing stock, I do hope that helps. Frances

420 2018-10-04 20:22:07 World stocks sag: Europe -1.1%; US -.8%. Investors suddenly awoke to rising interest-rates & the challenge that could pose to stocks. First casualties are utilities, REITs and general bond-proxy stocks. Further significant rise will imperil others. Stocks still best bet long-run.

424 2018-10-04 20:20:43 Stocks are down today.  Why dont you tweet about that?
425 2018-10-04 20:20:35 What has caused this today? Is it wider than just tech stocks?
426 2018-10-04 20:20:02 So overheating economy, super tight jobs, wages up and interest rates up. Good econ news but bad news for stocks. What's odd is the 10/2 spread widens which the inversion was a concern just last week but now it's not a concern?
427 2018-10-04 20:19:48 Stocks mean nothing to the majority of Americans.
428 2018-10-04 20:18:45 How does ANYONE pay attention to this complete and utter quack??? He is ALWAYS bearish the US, stocks, dollar and economy.  Always bullish gold.  Always forecasting armageddon.  He's a JOKE!

431 2018-10-04 20:16:21 After looking at so many stocks falling +10% off their highs... I think we are in fact IN a BEAR market. Only a few big stocks held this market up, along with stock buy backs
432 2018-10-04 20:16:13 Like.. I mean I feel bad for the amount of people that are going to instantly sell and just burn their money. Stocks DO come back. Money goes from the active to the patient.
433 2018-10-04 20:15:49 I still agree with you. No jail time. Do something creative he'll never forget. Stocks at crosstown mid-day? Maybe? Ha ha.

436 2018-10-04 20:15:19 Nice spin but Nasdaq is down nearly 2% today and S&P nearly 1%. It makes absolutely no difference how big the gap is between different countries stocks when they all go down which is what is just about to happen.

Mortgage rates are up, interest rates are up, industry is slowing.

447 2018-10-04 20:10:06 There are many, many people who want to make a fortune from investing in stocks.

So, you've got a lot of competition.

Your odds will improve if you work harder than them.
448 2018-10-04 20:10:06 Wait, none of the stocks are broken. Just cheaper.
449 2018-10-04 20:09:51 Stocks end sharply lower on interest rate fears, but mkt rallies from worst levels. Dow -200, -0.75% to 26,627, but was -1.3% at low. S&P -0.8%.

Nasdaq and Russell 2000 bear the brunt, -1.8% and -1.4% respectively.

464 2018-10-04 20:05:13 We all came into this world naked & broke. We may not leave naked but we will leave broke. Not 1 dollar,no stocks/bonds,no 401k,mutual funds. Nothing.

465 2018-10-04 20:05:11 Stocks tumble. After falling as much as 357 pts, the Dow closed at 26,627.48, down 200.91 (-0.75%). Nasdaq -1.81%. S&P -0.82%.

the way they both lose the first four stocks is soooo funny
511 2018-10-04 19:49:50 Not true ... they are going down 197.90 points today at this juncture .... and stocks are not the only indicator. Interest rates are going up!
512 2018-10-04 19:49:35 JUST IN: U.S. stocks in broad retreat as bond yields rise. S&P 500 on track for worst session in 3 months. Stocks fell sharply on Thursday as interest rates hit new multiyear highs, dampening investor sentiment. U.S. stock market is headed for a decline in the range of 8% to 13%.

529 2018-10-04 19:45:48 So many biotech stocks, even a bunch of them that trade in the penny stock space are on fire lately, and here is a stock at below three cents being attack by shorts and manipulators, that could be the next big thing since the little blue pill, being held back by these crooked S,B

it maybe a fund/trust. however, how is behind those trust and fund!
540 2018-10-04 19:43:12 I hope that's how this will play out but I'm worried U stocks will get crushed with everything else in an upcoming crash though.
541 2018-10-04 19:43:05 You should invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, and your marriage, but not necessarily in that order.
542 2018-10-04 19:42:47 Now that he has been driven out of Tesla for smashing those shorting his stocks could this be a coordinated attempt to drive down SpaceX stock?

548 2018-10-04 19:40:05 Well here we go. The carnage in international stocks and U.S. small and mid cap and FANG/tech stocks finally matters to large cap stocks. I guess the expected 10-year US Treasury rate spike was finally enough for them to roll over also.

559 2018-10-04 19:38:01 Is he suggesting we short US stocks then?
560 2018-10-04 19:38:00 Well duh. Corporation gets the largest tax break, they use that money to buy back their own stocks. This is pathetic. The only thing that should matter in US, is crime rate, cost of living, healthcare and how educated we are.

590 2018-10-04 19:30:56 People's well being has been disconnected from stocks since the 1980's when they rose by commoditizing the American labor force.  You're the anti-populist.

597 2018-10-04 19:28:33 You realize those employees lost their monthly bonuses and stocks because of it so they actually lost money on the deal.

600 2018-10-04 19:27:25 I would prefer the stocks split and everyone continues to receive stock as part of their compensation package. If all employees get stocks all will have a common interest to improve the value of the stocks. I view it as sort of a fairness insurance policy haha

627 2018-10-04 19:16:37 It is now obvious to me that my first experience trading stocks, and specifically margin trades and such, was on Runescape with the swordfish market. @RuneScape thank you for helping me choose my career path.

630 2018-10-04 19:14:38 They are looking at the stock aspect correctly. If we are aiming for someone's total compensation to be 31k but a single stock is worth 4k, it isn't easy to award stocks and keep the correct compensation. Stock pay needs to go so employees can earn a consistent wage.

635 2018-10-04 19:13:53 It's tough to stay in stocks sometimes, but I remind myself $AMRN still only has a $6B market cap, Vascepa could be doing $3B or $4B revenue per year & its patent protection runs til 2028. Not investment advice. Do your research elsewhere.

638 2018-10-04 19:13:25 Yeah I’m starting to see the difference between 35mm and 120 in colour stocks especially.  For example I love Fuji 400x in 120 but hate it in 35mm
639 2018-10-04 19:13:22 They are great!!
640 2018-10-04 19:12:49 No you said that they only offer penny stocks. Stay on the topic. I never implied that.
641 2018-10-04 19:12:43 the indicators are clear that these stocks are volatile in relation to a clear trending direction (bearish).  Make money BOTH WAYS unless a stock is stagnant or in a unpredictable flux state (in which case keep as cash and out of market).  ok to play as a bear if conditions demnd
642 2018-10-04 19:12:34 Best to buy US energy stocks. TOG,KEL and all these other cndn energy stocks are going nowhere, complete garbage.

657 2018-10-04 19:02:41 So now we’ll have all three branches of government firmly in the GOP camp (at least until the midterms). The Executive and Legislative branches are already laughing stocks. Looks like the Judicial branch isn’t far behind.
658 2018-10-04 19:02:24 We not only need to vote the Republican Party into Extinction we need to break their backs financially! People should be selling off their stocks that support Republican party members. Without money to back their propaganda there will be no propaganda

1) if you’re typical of most USian women, you control at least 80% of your household discretionary spending. So stop spending. Don’t pay down debt, save ALL the money you’re not spending where it doesn’t benefit men -not in banks, don’t buy stocks. Boycott the economy.

722 2018-10-04 18:38:21 What did the stock market do in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s? IRA and 401k only invented in the 1980s. Let's ask Mr. Buffett or Mr. Lynch. They both did well in the 1970s secular bear market when stocks were dirt cheap.

790 2018-10-04 18:15:51 @TheStalwart I liked your points on @planetmoney The Indicator about asset bubbles, especially the shared excitement of individuals beating the institutional money to cryptocurrencies and cannabis stocks. A commonality I had not connected.
791 2018-10-04 18:14:52 The only thing the Republican Party understands is money! If people would sell off their stocks and companies that support the Republican Party the Republican Party would go under. They would no longer have the funds to lie misrepresent the facts to the American people.

795 2018-10-04 18:14:06 Can you imagine the governmental savings and the incentive for investments and working harder and therefore more business etc. Stocks would go up and consumerism would drive the economy to new heights.
796 2018-10-04 18:14:03 Wages are not rising. And when they do the companies just cut other benefits and compensation. Shareholders only care about having seeing growth every quarter. They force suffering on the workers to get rising stocks and then just selloff and abandon the company if they see red.
797 2018-10-04 18:13:51 Why does @CNBC have a banner saying that stocks are plunging today because of a “spike” in rates?

10 yr Treasury rate up 1bp.
798 2018-10-04 18:13:44 Well youre guessing there. Drilling will prove this up. Until then...... roll the dice. Ive invested in a lot of gold stocks. Ive heard this song before. But..   could be very promising though
799 2018-10-04 18:13:41 Note that: Short #stocks today, long $BTC and you will be lucky. $NASDAQ is breaking out of a big ending triangle and has a -30% correction ahead.

805 2018-10-04 18:12:53 So identify your portfolios, if you have weak stocks, badly managed scripts- churn them! 
If you have good scripts, don’t book losses, just hold and buy more if surplus capital available!
If you are empty handed, keep fear aside and start buying!!!

Equity indices gave back a good chunk of recent gains as participants traded stocks for bonds after US 10y yields hit a 7 year high of of almost 3.20%; Solid US weekly jobless data assisted the yield move; NZD continued to struggle, hitting a low of 0.6474.

812 2018-10-04 18:10:35 Ugliness in the indices today, which isn't a big surprise with all the ugly internals we've seen.  When multiple stocks are failing on breakout attempts or making one day breakouts with no follow through it's a bad sign for the overall market. Always remember, CASH IS A POSITION.

815 2018-10-04 18:09:09 Market sentiment has reversed sharply from summer, when most buy and sell-side sources anticipated price increases into the fourth quarter. Now, most seem more concerned about buying before a further slip in prices devalues their stocks, heightening the wait-and-see mood.

Looking at track record, very little volume interest in this stock entire year until now. What say u abt interest?
823 2018-10-04 18:06:32 11:03am: All my stocks are DOWN today!

11:05am: THAT is the whitest thing I’ve ever said.
824 2018-10-04 18:06:29 This fall, which hasn’t stopped yet has primarily taught us to be in good stocks only. Possessing fundamentally safe stocks always keeps us safe. 
If we like a stock at a high price, why do we resist to buy more when it crashes. Being in good stocks can make us do so.

830 2018-10-04 18:05:36 2018 has been an year of total uncertainty for the stock markets. So many reasons, starting from the LTCG Tax of 10 percent in the Budget 2018, have been the trigger for one of the worst sell of in small and mid cap stocks.

838 2018-10-04 18:03:09 Since you think 2.6% for 5 years is a great Interest Rate i think you are peroetuating the austerity and robbery of savers so loved by Mark Carney ...none of your offerings of stocks are doing much good either
839 2018-10-04 18:03:00 What sort of things are you expecting besides closing certain stocks at round numbers?
840 2018-10-04 18:02:00 Remember that immediately after this mass shooting Republicans said they would ban bump stocks... and then NOTHING HAPPENED?
841 2018-10-04 18:01:57 Bond yields are up so there will be some selloff in stocks. If the Fed continues to increase interest rates the selling will get worse.
842 2018-10-04 18:01:37 My investments goals are:

Paying of all debts including mortgage
                       &

845 2018-10-04 17:59:15 Fair point, rising rates due to good strong economic growth is ok.  This is especially true when rates are still so low.  The concern I have is when rising rates effectively get ahead of the economic growth.  Stocks typically peak ~7 months ahead of recessions.  We're probably ok

913 2018-10-04 17:39:34 I understand. But I still see this as more of an overall market reaction then just this particular stock. There are a lot of good stocks down a ton today. pyx.

922 2018-10-04 17:36:44 Best advice I ever got is to just assume that money you put in stocks (for a casual investor) is locked away for 7-10 years. Then you don’t worry about the day to day.

946 2018-10-04 17:28:34 if we short future we will be buying 1 ATR away call na sir?

and one more question suppose yesterday low in a stock is 99.25 and in first 25 minutes stocks breaks low i.e., 99.25 and reverses and again after 9.40 it breaks 99.25... can we take the entry or we have to ignore?
947 2018-10-04 17:27:52 This move in stocks isn’t even moving the bonds.  It’s not a big deal, at all.

1015 2018-10-04 17:08:22 Yeah. I mean my top 5 stocks are 50% ish so not like I’m not concentrated. But 30% seems bananas.
1016 2018-10-04 17:08:17 Generally my thought right now given its highly speculative nature, is that if all assets decline, then so will Crypto. The one huge caveat is if the big whack comes to the $USD, then all bets are off. So far even Cannabis stocks aren't all getting whacked today. Let's see at 4.
1017 2018-10-04 17:08:12 7th October 2008 was the evening where it was agreed RBS would be bailed out to the tune 500bln. 3 days time it will be 10 years. Now approx. 3 x as many stocks making 52 week lows as highs. Not seen since 1999.
1018 2018-10-04 17:07:16 I think consistency to whichever sizing discipline you choose is key. I tend to agree with your approach, but some clients do like concentrated 5 stocks portfolios. Where ive seen most get blown up is when they change rules to let that one high flyer run

1055 2018-10-04 16:57:50 The 10-year Treasury note yield jumped 10.3 basis points.

Rising yields appeared to dampen a rally in stocks.

1221 2018-10-04 16:15:37 Interest rates have increased. Normally, this has an inverse relationship on the market as bond yields rise, stocks will reduce since investors will move money from the market and into bonds.

1315 2018-10-04 15:55:15 @JeffBezos hi jeff! I work at phl5, and I was never asked about this pay raise or vcp & rsu's, so many of my co workers are devastated! The monthly vcp and stocks got me through, 1$ an hour is nothing compared to those....why couldnt we just get a raise?
1316 2018-10-04 15:55:10 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $STZ. $NOV, $LLY, $HPQ, and $BHGE.
1317 2018-10-04 15:55:00 That's not true. Suppose I give you tips / advice on which stocks to buy, but you never buy those stocks. I have, nevertheless, given you that advice, have I not? And this is a big technical reality.

1320 2018-10-04 15:54:14 Really appreciate ur effort. Looks fine but most of stocks form longer wick. So can we neglect it
1321 2018-10-04 15:54:12 I'd rather have guaranteed income that comes on every check than stocks or bonuses that rely on performance
1322 2018-10-04 15:54:03 The stocks of the company that supposedly implanted this chips has fallen from 24 to 9 .40 dlls, Apple and Amazon denied that any leak of information had happened to them, would this be a strategy from US government to create manufacturing jobs at US soil?
1323 2018-10-04 15:53:42 There is fashion statement"you can't make money in commodity stocks". However if catch at start of the rally and get out timely, there is humugus amount of money in between... Sugar is in such a trend
1324 2018-10-04 15:53:41 But Amazon took away stocks and bonuses... Corporations are so frickin shady. Just do right and trickle the wealth down a bit already!! Ffs...
1325 2018-10-04 15:53:37 And yet, due to the now reduced competition in the space, they're in a position to raise prices and have less of an incentive to improve their products, so they can cut costs. Not surprising both stocks are way up.

1347 2018-10-04 15:48:23 It’s not my normal strategy but how stocks have running recently I believed it could go further, if you look at my past trades most of them are 30/50 cents a share profit. Today it was greed.
1348 2018-10-04 15:48:03 Trader to trader stocks to trade is great but it’s not worth the almost $200 dollars a month, etrade or Td ameritrade platforms work just fine for profits, but if you try STT and really like it by all means, Amazing platform to use but it should be a luxury when u have alot of

1353 2018-10-04 15:46:21 Yeah, just speaking on principle, funds can't hold OTC stocks. They're not supposed to at least. They should have left a long time ago

1359 2018-10-04 15:44:55 The US Fed quietly warned Congress so they could sell stocks and whatnot. Crooked system.
1360 2018-10-04 15:44:43 They’re making idiots of themselves. Don’t they realize the entire world is listening to the rubbish they’re speaking. They’re laughing stocks and making a mockery of the US judicial system. They must be stopped.
1361 2018-10-04 15:44:31 And now it has been made public that this “raise” came with the elimination of stocks and bonuses for these employees who were already struggling and now will now be even worse off before. So good job, I guess
1362 2018-10-04 15:44:14 @AnilSinghviZEE @CNBC_Awaaz @porinju @StocksResearch from year 2014 to 2018 bse jumped from 20000 to 39000 and small cap index from 6000 to 19000 in terms of valuation stocks are down between 20 to 50% which is normal infact we are preparing for wildest bull market from 2019

1364 2018-10-04 15:43:54 Things are looking and feeling a bit frothy in equities, if it weren't for protectionist policies (good or bad) I think we are delaying the inevitable rout in stocks. This could lead to a much larger, more prolonged correction in all asset prices.
1365 2018-10-04 15:43:44 It's more to do with Before and After. Stocks with after bad news is out rose

1379 2018-10-04 15:40:03 That’s a little bit disingenuous, isn’t it? People only watch you and pay attention to what you say re: stocks because that’s precisely your job and how you present yourself as. If you were a rando nobody would mistake it for advice. Can’t have it both ways
1380 2018-10-04 15:40:01 You mean like the Boston Marathon Bombing, or Sandyhook, 9/11 building #7, Las Vegas shooting with bump stocks. Baptist church shooting in Texas, I mean it goes on and on... Moon landing, JFK....??????

1387 2018-10-04 15:36:05 Well the gods honest truth to that is simply... ignorance. By strict dictionary definition. One lacking knowledge.

1406 2018-10-04 15:28:20 Breadth‘s been very weak for quite sometime, and the lack of broad participation really means the liquidity is rapidly draining. Another sure sign is the retail stocks selling while the consumer confidence just hit ATH. The liquidity peaked, then you have EMs selling for months.

1417 2018-10-04 15:24:57 Good or bad time to buy dividend stocks? US Treasury yields are highest in 7 years, making dividend stock prices fall. But does that price fall make that dividend look more attractive? Where will it balance out?

1444 2018-10-04 15:14:01 Pressure on stocks as bonds sells off. When bonds get propped up stocks continue up. This can continue a while as they print masssively while killing the currency. Stealing cash from every other existing dollar. Get out of cash.

1510 2018-10-04 14:51:47 Amazon can absolutely exist without him. Management, CEOs, board members get replaced all the time. His value lies more in company confidence for stocks than anything unique to him. Especially trillions times more unique.

1558 2018-10-04 14:41:07 I'm not wealthy and I own stocks.  Gas Prices have been decreasing in NYS.  I already said I got a raise.  SO your points are actually lies.  LOL.
1559 2018-10-04 14:41:03 It's just as bad banning bump stocks with a R next to your name as a D. Founders would hang their head
1560 2018-10-04 14:40:47 We know what your "investigations" look like. And all the info on Kavanaugh you withheld. Did you release your tax returns yet? Did you ban bump stocks yet? Oh, right "hard to push through," though you push through this, and you'll separate kids from parents. What a joke you are.
1561 2018-10-04 14:40:31 If you want to start small try the app acorn. If you really want to watch stocks, open up a Bank of America account put the money you want to invest in the account. Then find stock codes for the stocks you want to invest in. Watch your account grow. I currently do both.

1566 2018-10-04 14:39:30 Which inherently puts the Fed in Trump's cross hairs. What a time. Fed didn't think it through. They saw what Washington was doing and now they want to take it all back while they talk down stocks at the same time. Not going to work.

1589 2018-10-04 14:35:23 Returns from high-yield bonds have already been muted this year, especially relative to markets like stocks.

1592 2018-10-04 14:35:09 Yes, & I've argued its even worse than that - Wash DC has made stock mkt THE key component to consumer spend growth that drives 65% of GDP & therefore US Tax receipts.  So if anything happens to stks, UST supplies will rise > demand (ie ylds up on stocks down, like in Feb.)

If u want to build up LARGE holdings in stocks, u have LET go the craze for bottom fishing.

If a stock moves from 1000 to 10,000 u have to be willing to buy ALL the way, from 2000 to 6000, provided valuations keep pace with price rise.

Getting scared not an option.

Right now the S&P has a dividend yield of 1.9%. 10-year is now 3.17%. Bell says a 10 yr above 4% could lead to underperformance in stocks

1680 2018-10-04 14:12:34 I agree with you on that, but to prolong our argument...  Most Amazon warehouse employees are in the retail segment of their biz which is NOT profitable. Min wage increase deepens their losses there. Awarding stocks on top would be irresponsible business.
1681 2018-10-04 14:11:54 Ok so buying 100 of a $1 stock is way more effective than buying 5 $20 stocks. Just a tip

1688 2018-10-04 14:10:29 Stocks will decide their bargain value, after that volumes themselves comes down and demand will be created after some duration.

It is IMPOSSIBLE to get the bottom. 

What i have learnt over the years is that 

# the LAST phase is generally a free fall

# even if u get stocks CLOSE to the free-fall, it's profitable 

# stocks STAY fallen for some time 

# one can keep buying on way up
1690 2018-10-04 14:10:07 Today,#Sensex crashed over 800 points.

1691 2018-10-04 14:10:05 unless you cash those stocks in, they may not be worth crap if the economy collapses.  Of course when you cash them in they won't be worth as much when you pay all the fees associated with processing them.

1710 2018-10-04 14:04:37 Stocks typically rise during Fed tightenings and peak close to when the yield curved inverts. Based on Fed funds vs. the 10-year, we still have some room. With our long-term readings bullish, the secular bull is still alive, but that does not rule out a cyclical correction.

1734 2018-10-04 13:59:25 Rates up stocks down. 3.18% yield in the ten year. We think this goes higher. Stocks take a pause to digest but we want a steep yield curve proving the strength in the economy. This process will continue for some time.

1750 2018-10-04 13:52:45 @timothysykes Learned a new rookie mistake today. A sub-topic of "not being prepared". Putting stocks on your watch list and then not remembering why.
1751 2018-10-04 13:52:38 Any good stocks? 
1752 2018-10-04 13:52:37 Agreed. It seems like the only stocks that are doing well are those in the DJIA. lol
1753 2018-10-04 13:52:32 Hey day traders, is your favourite way of finding "stocks in play"?
1754 2018-10-04 13:52:14 I'm really good at picking stocks but boy do I suck at setting stop losses. I get stopped out and it continues on without me way more times then I can count. 
1755 2018-10-04 13:51:26 I agree that many parts of autos are sensitive to rates as many are financed via variable/short end borrowings.  I have stared at the homewrecker stocks too.  Valid points, but the breaking point isn't just yet but his bell ringing is noteworthy and registered.
1756 2018-10-04 13:51:23 Kolanovic highlighting gap between U.S. and Chinese internet stocks on @BloombergTV
1757 2018-10-04 13:51:17 Correct.  But if stocks fall, the deficit (UST issuance) will increase faster than the increase in buyers.  Only hope is to inflate the heck out of stocks & hope it will translate into growth tax receipts that reduce issuance...but that don't drive a rise in yields.
1758 2018-10-04 13:51:07 IF... and I say IF, keyword there... Trump is being truthful on the matter, bump stocks are in the final stages of being made illegal.  He said it's been a process.  So yeah, actions will speak louder than words, but it sounds like 3 weeks out, we'll have an official update

1765 2018-10-04 13:49:18 It's still a big surface area.  The main draw would be that the fish stocks are relatively un harvested.

1809 2018-10-04 13:37:00 Yeah, umm, no that's not what they said at all. Two things:

Before Las Vegas, how many mass murders using Bump Stocks? After Las Vegas? HINT: it's 0 for both.

2nd, most experts agree he'd have killed more people without a bump stock.

Ban then if you want, I don't care.
1810 2018-10-04 13:36:51 This is not a win for us, please don't praise Sanders, Bezos, or Amazon. They're eliminating our monthly productivty/attendance bonuses and employee stocks.

1846 2018-10-04 13:29:03 One difference would be that last October the number of stocks making new highs stayed relatively elevated. Right now new low list is expanding at a time when new high list is contracting.

1853 2018-10-04 13:26:41 Same cast of characters in $MSRT and other stocks as well.  That company was one of the most heavily promoted stocks in the cannabis industry in 2017 and Honig & his co-defendants were all involved in the company in 2017.

1858 2018-10-04 13:24:47 Yeah, I'm never commenting on reasons. Same with stocks, there is always a reason. Main point being when it can't get any better, it must get worse and vice versa. My whole life runs like that.

1868 2018-10-04 13:23:15 Making money if you already have money is astonishing.

1869 2018-10-04 13:22:18 @LeeR912 Soo.. Playing devils advocate. If there is a Dollar/economic reset, why won't people switch to Gold and Silver instead of XRP? Hearing that Goldman are long on Silver now. Countries like Russia,China, and India  are already loading up their stocks

1904 2018-10-04 13:12:28 It is a catch 22.. read the whole story.  There are multiple negatives including no more stocks given to employees.  Where Amazon gives, it also took things away from its employees.  A win/lose.

1909 2018-10-04 13:08:41 Do you work for Amazon? Because all of that information is inaccurate. Bonuses are MONTHLY based on productivity/attendance, and stocks are annual vesting after 2 years. So every year some stock would vest for longtime employees. This gone = overall pay cut.
1910 2018-10-04 13:08:41 Stocks are falling as bond yields rise. And Snapchat's woes continue. $SNAP down after two analysts cut their price targets. I'll discuss with @jchatterleyCNN on @cnni @firstmove just after the market opens at 9:30 ET.

But whether penny stocks or not, it's always a gamble w/o knowledge, experience & plans to capitalize on both. A solid bet requires all three either way. Rather find solid bets w/ high gains.

"Market Cap" - refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares. It is calculated by multiplying a company's shares outstanding by the current price. It is commonly used to determine a company's size.

1932 2018-10-04 12:57:06 So what just caused such a spike in yields and stocks?
1933 2018-10-04 12:55:55 It's not just that raites are rising that may pressure stocks but the rate of rise that can disintermediate models
1934 2018-10-04 12:55:30 Dow implied open -50 now...not the end of the world...expecting more chop ahead of NFP.  Plan is to look for opps in both strong (long) & weak (short) stocks/etfs.

Vague exercises.

1944 2018-10-04 12:48:08 Aye.  On a side note Merrill Lynch has passed a rule where no client can buy or sell equities that are below $5 per share.  They say they are trying to protect investors from 'penny stocks' but ironically that now means these traders cant purchase Sears shares lol.

1950 2018-10-04 12:45:54 (1/2) When I talk about the "generalized" asset market boom/bubble (depending on your perception) that aggressive global #QE/record-low #interestrates has driven, I get the sense some don't "get it." They focus solely on #stocks, or maybe high-yield #bonds, etc.
1951 2018-10-04 12:45:30 Maybe, maybe not.  Schiff’s advice to gullible people like you is dangerous though.  He’s been screaming to sell stocks and buy gold since 2011.  Cost me a lot of money until I finally wisened up.
1952 2018-10-04 12:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 8 stocks Wednesday including $INFN, $CSIQ and  $ITUB.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 52% in $WTW where October 70.0 calls bought for $2.50 closed at $3.80.

1961 2018-10-04 12:42:12 The tax cuts were a few hundred billion. A 10% correction in US stocks would equate to $3 trillion loss. Relationship of course not one for one but you get my point.

Yeah, the raises were pretty insignificant to begin with considering most Amazon employees are working in cities with absurd costs of living, but now they've also slashed all Tier 2 and 3 employee's wages down to 15 and revoked their stocks.

Although the raise was nice, you then took other things away like stocks.  Therefore, I’ll be shopping elsewhere bc I don’t support greed.  Thanks,have a great day.

1986 2018-10-04 12:30:18 Whenever I read articles they say Apple is the largest company.

2031 2018-10-04 12:12:32 I was getting 2 stocks of Amazon and $1500 of vcp. A 1.75 pay increase does not make up for the benefit loss. This is not a gain it is a loss. You need to keep your dirty hands out of stuff that's not your business.

1. Bying companies with very little debt or the ability to handle the debt without problems.
2.Not using leverage in investing.
3.Avoiding cyclical stocks?
4. Keep some cash like 10-20%?
5. Buying stocks that is not too sensitive to cycles. Mcdonalds and diapers?

They all say they are sniffing at a recession. Have you had any of these discussions?

2100 2018-10-04 11:44:47 I think quotas themselves are a large part of the problem.

2108 2018-10-04 11:42:49 Indeed. You're quite right - serious headwinds for our prop stocks. Thus I'm buying slowly and trying to stick with quality. HYP not the quality it was but still attractive at the right price - which admittedly could be quite a bit further down.

2291 2018-10-04 10:15:28 How much US debt is recycled in repos and various other shadow pathways to buy US stocks? This was always my theory: more US debt = more shadow money = more stock purchasing power. I.e. the Fed's most important role is to backstop the debt; B/S level in itself is irrelevant?

2300 2018-10-04 10:11:16 really enjoyed this post. its another reason to not pick stocks that I feel gets overlooked. typically its about the person  choosing bad stocks but the fact that most stocks simply under perform the index is a great point.

2311 2018-10-04 10:05:35 Good for you for thinking about this now! 
1) Time is your friend. 
2) Don't invest your "I need now" $. 
3) Only invest in real companies with real numbers (don't gamble). 
4) View corrections as "one day only"sales of your favorite stocks. 
5) Don't panic. 
You'll be fine.

2334 2018-10-04 09:54:04 A few banking stocks holding breath fr RBI rate hike decision. After tht  expect neat fall - 20%
2335 2018-10-04 09:51:48 Money tends towards one, hard money defeats other money, use tokens are like prepaid cards, useless. Stocks are shares in entities which are about, new markets and innovation. Money is invested in stocks to share the risk associated with these risks. Stocks not going away.

2337 2018-10-04 09:49:33 The #ASX was only my vehicle as practise grounds before moving over to the U.S Markets.

2338 2018-10-04 09:48:34 People from most countries have at least something at stake (ranging from stocks to rights and peace) when it comes to who's going to be occupying the WH. Someone might argue that even more so with Nato countries (like the one Ida is from), as their military is on the same boat.
2339 2018-10-04 09:48:25 Don’t burst all of @realDonaldTrump’s minions bubbles. If they don’t have “huge and record” setting stocks to claim, they have nothing.
2340 2018-10-04 09:48:11 Good aren’t they. Been using them for years and only just found somewhere in London that stocks them after they rebranded all the packaging
2341 2018-10-04 09:47:48 What a joke! Start eating stocks listed at NSE BSE
2342 2018-10-04 09:47:47 Tom, wouldn’t rising bond yields become (finally) competition for the investment dollar with stocks ? Would think that would have negative long term implications for the stock market.
2343 2018-10-04 09:47:31 The idea that “all tokens will fall to zero” only works if either 1) no tokens are securities, or 2) all securities, including stocks, all cease having economic value.

Either scenario is very unlikely.  

Stocks are here to stay and they will be tokenized.

Get on board.

2351 2018-10-04 09:43:17 I would like to trade half my stocks, so I am looking at a new high to sell. Should it be around 19 just after opening? Which do think is the trading zone? would you buy back intraday, or wait for new low next sessions? I think no major event will happen before 11/10

2421 2018-10-04 08:41:11 The most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen is that stream strip on Business Day TV showing headlines and stocks then they say “Business Day cannot be held responsible for any incorrect data” lmfao what?!
2422 2018-10-04 08:40:22 Get out while you still can. The window is closing  fast. Insiders are selling their own stocks while doing massive buybacks with company money (aka debt).

Don't wait until it's to late. Better take profit now....

2425 2018-10-04 08:39:03 Can you just stick with stocks?
2426 2018-10-04 08:38:15 ah well yay, since it'll be a preorder-only thing, I don't plan to order more copies than needed so I don't keep stocks. If I need more envelopes, I'll buy more, but for now I'm aiming small xD
2427 2018-10-04 08:37:43 Oui, je sortie aussi, j'ai croisé ma voisine qui partait au marché faire des stocks avant la pénurie, le cantonnier en train de creuser une tranchée, alors j'ai couru jusqu'au café du village et je les ai trouvé tous là en train de discuter de la récolte des pommes. ANGOISSE !
2428 2018-10-04 08:37:11 After today’s fall in Sensex, I think the gains accrued over the last 3-4 years on stocks purchased have finally been wiped out. No reason to worry of course, we are living in achche din.

2431 2018-10-04 08:35:11 Problem is stocks have performed so badly on AIM for so long, that most people are underwater,no matter what stock they are in..So they are trapped in..So no liquidity in the market at the minute..I like #MRS and it's cheap...But so are many others..
2432 2018-10-04 08:33:56 Maybe do intensive research before buying and then not do another review until 2 years has passed? Looking back on my own investing I feel that I have been following the stocks too closely and that I could reduce the amount of following after bought it. Just my experience.
2433 2018-10-04 08:33:20 Stocks standing strong amidst the carnage - Hindalco, Nalco ,Deepak Nitrite and Nocil
2434 2018-10-04 08:32:55 They do not have any old unreturned stocks. I’m still looking tho
2435 2018-10-04 08:30:51 First averaging is against the principle of investing. Second don’t fall in love  with any stocks. And last but not the least always remember history repeats itself.
2436 2018-10-04 08:30:24 #EmergingMarket stocks are down about 2%, the most since March on a closing, thanks for rising UST yields. As soon as one risk starts diminishing, another pops up to remind you how fickle markets can be. The lira, btw, is more than 2% weaker against the USD

2440 2018-10-04 08:27:22 I wonder how long the Chinese leaders are going to sit back and watch Chinese stocks go down.
2441 2018-10-04 08:26:07 Bonds continued to fall overnight and weighed on Asian stocks with Nikkei down 0.71% and HK down a further 1.88%. US 10yr yields rocketed to 3.21% and 30s are soaring and now at 3.38%.
2442 2018-10-04 08:26:02 Bonds continued to fall overnight and weighed on Asian stocks with Nikkei down 0.71% and HK down a further 1.88%. US 10yr yields rocketed to 3.21% and 30s are soaring and now at 3.38%.
2443 2018-10-04 08:25:33 This is not a logic that can make any analyst sound super smart or diligent. But my experience, over the past years, says that it is extremely useful in filtering out bad stocks.

2450 2018-10-04 08:20:15 What if I ask: How seldom would you be comfortable checking the prices of your stocks? Once per year? Is there a frequency that is too low for being optimal? Assuming you are a long term investor.
2451 2018-10-04 08:19:37 My advice..Indian market going to be down till next stable government. Now not to invest till Election 2019, at time to result..buy Good bluechip company stocks.

2453 2018-10-04 08:17:28 How does averaging in stocks that has value causes harm? This is a great opportunity to average if they had paid a higher cost . Of course this applied to Long term investor..

2455 2018-10-04 08:16:22 The analysis from @resi_analyst shows there is no crisis as you and I have tended to believe.

The bubble only exists in major "desirable" cities. 

QE funds had to flow somewhere. The choice was over valued stocks or real estate.

My advice :
1. Hold on to quality stocks even if they are down 15 20%
2. Dont panic..stop watching ticker prices
3. If you have surplus , deploy in buying

2482 2018-10-04 07:57:35 The S&P BSE Allcap index accounts for 99% of the total market capitalisation of BSE listed companies. As many as 359 stocks out of 1,068 companies on the index are down more than 50% from their 52-week high levels on the BSE. That's 1 out of 3. @SunilBSinghania @NagpalManoj

2488 2018-10-04 07:53:07 FTSE 100 - 7,462.36 −47.92 - many defensive stocks have been hit by increasing bond yields with fears about Italy and Greece again to the fore. One suspects that a hawkish FED is driving these yields up!

2494 2018-10-04 07:48:44 Salaried people should not rely on behaviour - just be in a long term SIP and don't break it for anything. No salaried person can make money in individual stocks in the long term. ( except for those with loads of good luck )
2495 2018-10-04 07:48:10 Global stocks fall on US bond rout. 10y US Treasury yields highest since 2011 at 3.22% following upbeat data, hawkish Fed
2496 2018-10-04 07:47:39 Sadly yes. Along with rees nog who thinks we all have isa, stocks and savings to fall back on, its obvious that we're on completely different planets
2497 2018-10-04 07:47:31 SBI Life went below 500 on 01st Oct 2018 when Sensex was up 250 points.

Today Sensex is down 700+ points and SBI Life at 565.

Moral - Sharply corrected, Good  stocks, will bounce back stronger after Q2 earnings. Risk - flat Q2 earnings can take NIFTY below 10k.

2500 2018-10-04 07:44:12 I did that for @CIPR_UK awards. It was really good to be shortlisted and I met some great people, but it underlined to me that what we do is really specialised and specific, and it's quite hard to explain to those in mainstream journalism or PR.
2501 2018-10-04 07:43:38 Lots of defensive stocks getting hurt by higher bond yields
2502 2018-10-04 07:43:09 I am holding 7 stocks, 6 of which are largecaps and 3 short positions. So not really seen what happenned to midcaps, what did I miss?

2505 2018-10-04 07:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2506 2018-10-04 07:39:07 It really depends on the MU. I had a really hard time learning falco (Im good now bc of hours with @haraldvin and @Zorc85 ), abusive foxes and marths who knows what theyre doing. However I do agree he is one of the best at finishing stocks

2521 2018-10-04 07:25:41 Fortunately it hasn't hit me today but 2018 really has been the year of Profit Warnings. Stocks that have been good for many years are suddenly coming out with them. It's clearly been a big part of why so difficult to make progress this year.
2522 2018-10-04 07:25:32 So do you think that it is a time to buy value stocks under current circumstances in the Indian Market ??
2523 2018-10-04 07:25:16 Hi! Don't be disheartened. Due to overwhelming responses from the customers the product went out of stock. The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller. (1/2)

2545 2018-10-04 07:10:04 @cnbcKaren @steve_sedgwick Goodmorning european stocks are lower but to me normal down less than 1 percent i expected alot these weeks. maybe this downtrend is caused by worry or expectation after  USMCA , The deal should be done as US-Europe new Deal!

2549 2018-10-04 07:08:09 Never be too perturbed about stk mkt as long as you have systematic investments. Corrections are a necessity & periodically, very useful. They help churn the sectors/stocks. Also, we should never lose wit & humor. Always have a smile. Life is not that bad & need to appreciate it.

2584 2018-10-04 06:48:46 I go by returns, not NAV. Dividend funds are best for people who need regular income & less risk. These funds typically have stocks like ITC, HUL who give consistent dividends. Equity funds work better IMO. Bluechips perform better in bad times. Midcaps better in the long term.

I’d rather take a guaranteed $160 a month than maybe $192 a month at $15 an hour. More likely I’d see an extra $96 a month with the bonuses.

2671 2018-10-04 05:42:28 The dollar notched an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011, while Asian stocks were pressured as borrowing costs rose at home.

2704 2018-10-04 05:17:54 No it doesn't, since I invested in Shell Gas stocks. By them increasing the price, it benefits me
2705 2018-10-04 05:17:34 Instead buy stocks like Apple and Amazon at peak prices, good luck.

2707 2018-10-04 05:14:33 As a former employee, give me that extra money an hour. Sure, I could get the 4% bonus reliably a month, but getting all 8% rarely ever happened because the other 4% was dependent on the entire facility. As for the stocks; you had to wait two years just to touch them.
2708 2018-10-04 05:14:32 Miran that is dumb, they will print more tickets and you will high chance to win but still overall not great investment, I suggest you hire a reputable broker and invest 50-70% of your money in stocks
2709 2018-10-04 05:13:30 At the republican party we have no memory of a massacre in Las Vegas. People kill using a gun and then blame guns. The men building bump stocks would not be able to pay NRA dues. Congress knows about school shootings but it's just fake news.
2710 2018-10-04 05:13:04 Ready to take notes? Real simple, when an economy begins to flourish jobs also increase, it goes hand in hand. Increased income leads to increased spending and vice versa. Stocks can increase and decrease due to presidential actions absolutely.
2711 2018-10-04 05:11:27 Value stocks (growth but cheap) not quality stocks (growth with high price) is performing very well since yesterday in this bloodbath market !!... hmm

2714 2018-10-04 05:10:09 rather than hoping for the other 4% and stocks. The other 4%, by the way, was only awarded if the entire facility’s production rate was more than 100%, I think 110 or so. At 100% you might bet one percent. At 99.9%, you got zero extra money.
2715 2018-10-04 05:09:50 I constantly come to twitter to see your updated analysis. I appreciate you posting all these comments on all the stocks your watching. Havnt got any emails yet but I'm waiting for those too :)  Thank you BD!

But there are 2 stocks that have gained over 50% in last 4 trading sessions.

Any Guesses ?

2721 2018-10-04 05:05:04 My 401k only went up 2% year to date, doesn't help the average joe who doesn't trade in stocks for a living.
2722 2018-10-04 05:05:00 But you did have paid time and vacation that accrued that you could use in emergencies. I don’t remember what it was exactly, but paid time accrued monthly while vacation accrued quarterly. As for the stocks, you didn’t get much, I got ~$2300 off the four stocks I received. But
2723 2018-10-04 05:02:47 Circumstances have changed since the last tweet and I found out amazon is taking away those employee’s  bonuses and stocks, so that is robbing Peter to pay PETER. Otherwise, a corporation and its workers are not “similar”; so it would make no sense
2724 2018-10-04 05:02:09 Most of this year 10-20 points dip in Nifty led to 0.5-1% drawback in most stocks , now its reverse Nifty merely up 10points from lows stocks up by 1% . Will this sustain beyond tomorrow RBI policy ? big big question . #watching #trendreversal
2725 2018-10-04 05:01:25 When would you get stock awards? At what point do you start getting stocks and how frequently do you get them? Not challenging you, honest questions.

2727 2018-10-04 05:00:47 That's true.  The current stock program was discontinued at the same time as the new $15 goes into effect.  (The associates said they would rather see the $ in their check vs waiting for stocks to vest) They are looking into new programs to replace it though.  #What'scomingnext

2730 2018-10-04 04:59:55 Honestly, as a former employee, I would have rather have the $15 an hour starting than the “bonuses” that you only get under certain conditions and the stocks that you only get after two years of continuous employment.

2733 2018-10-04 04:56:02 Please also do some work to reduce production cost and increased efficiency with safety of worker, low transportation and storage cost to overall development which is missing from out coal India stocks. @PMOIndia
2734 2018-10-04 04:55:13 Time to consume consumption stocks! No matter how high oil goes we won't stop wasting tasty and unhealthy food and stop using Cosmetics!
2735 2018-10-04 04:55:12 Conversely, this means 2/3rds of the stocks in your index funds provide no return.  Also, a few stocks do really, really well, so you can way outperform indexes if you choose well.
2736 2018-10-04 04:54:59 Peak season monthly incentive double.  If I'm not mistaken you can earn up to an extra $400-$500 a month for peak. Yearly you can get 2-4 stocks at $2,000 each.
2737 2018-10-04 04:54:24 It was the associates' that said they wanted to see the $ in their pay & not having to wait for their stocks to vest.  That's why the current RSU plan was eliminated.  They are looking into some type of direct stock purchase plan to replace it.  We'll just have to wait & see.
2738 2018-10-04 04:53:29 The so called assault weapons under Clinton did nothing. Bump stocks can go. Makes the weapon so inaccurate. As far as the size of the magazine it does little to nothing. How long does it take to change a magazine and recharge the weapon 5 seconds or less?
2739 2018-10-04 04:52:24 Update: However as I had said this next few months represents a good opportunity to create a portfolio of good funds and few very few top stocks with a 3-4 year view. As we suspected the markets have trapped in most folks with that 'new high' jig. Funky PMS investees = new mob!!

2750 2018-10-04 04:47:16 Many new traders are drawn to supposedly undervalued stocks trading at or near their 52 week lows. Be careful most are there for a good reason.

2791 2018-10-04 04:23:38 Eh.  But why?  His job is to make himself more money.  You can have bonuses and stocks, or you can think short term and get more money upfront and take your own risks,  which may be better off anyway.

2794 2018-10-04 04:22:18 Feels like the bottom is falling off #stocks isn't it? But all is not lost yet. The next key support for #Sensex is 35000 and for #Nifty is 10550. Let's hope these hold, else there could be big trouble. @sanjeev85624057 @businessline

2827 2018-10-04 04:03:44 Perhaps some of you are better than me at this, but when big news events are around the corner, I tend not to hold open positions. This is similar to how you try not to hold open positions during the NFP or earnings when trading stocks.
2828 2018-10-04 04:03:36 There is a process for banning bump stocks. It is in motion. Try and pay attention.

2844 2018-10-04 03:56:27 This is a sad piece of wisdom that I am embarrassed to say I've forgotten as it's pushed out to the margins. This is central to what we are dealing w/today.

2847 2018-10-04 03:53:53 So the 10yr at 3.5% would be normalish, with it could come a 30% decline in stocks, making valuations normalish....both good things. But the Fed and the Pols will hit the panic button and it won’t happen.

2849 2018-10-04 03:52:07 They admit that it’s a global expansion, and yet lump all cannabis stocks as being tied strictly to the Canadian market. It’s half-assed analysis. That said, a lot of companies look ridiculously expensive. But a lot don’t.

2883 2018-10-04 03:27:34 This is exactly why people still buy stocks. Momentum is a powerful and underestimated force.
2884 2018-10-04 03:27:30 You have more cajones than me to play those types of stocks.
2885 2018-10-04 03:27:21 The “awesome” economy is really only great for the 1% and those who cash out their stocks right now. The way the GOP murders the golden goose is as appalling as it is predictable. 

Democrats build steong economies and Republicans cash them out to make the uber wealthy richer.
2886 2018-10-04 03:25:44 Don lemmon your a joke to journalism! People inherite money from their parents every damn day! The stocks were dropping before the election because they thought Hillary was going to win. Record gains is record gains. The economy is booming now and now only!!

2912 2018-10-04 03:08:48 Why will investors be in stocks if the rate of return from S&P in form of dividends is 1.8% when they are getting a better return on a 10 year treasury note 3.18%? I'm not an economist but just thinking why they would favor stocks at inflated levels?
2913 2018-10-04 03:08:36 Pls don't try & sell PE(Puts) in this environment how much so ever attractive they might look because of High IVs. The Range of stocks & index on downside is too big to be controlled once it gets ITM.

Its that period where Option Buying works better with timely entry n exit..

2926 2018-10-04 02:59:55 Yea you're right about that managers at the warehouses are still gunna receive their stocks. Just hourly associates will not receive anymore stocks. We're losing thousand of dollars a year because of this.
2927 2018-10-04 02:59:23 but still market is over valued, unless stock prices goes to feb 2016 levels there is a chance that people may not make money for 3-5 yrs considering worst case scenario to follow even in good quality stocks if invested at current levels.

2932 2018-10-04 02:56:52 You're missing the point. Their min wage is lower than $15 but it was supplemented by bonuses for meeting targets & stocks once a year. If amazon raises the wage but cuts the other $, it's a wash.

2936 2018-10-04 02:52:33 That's false they gave us a dollar raise but are not giving us our yearly stocks and they took away our monthly bonus so we're losing between 1500k and 3500k a year depending on the bonuses

2940 2018-10-04 02:49:35 We need to be patient. The days of Lithium being a hype spec stock are gone imo. The story will now be about real results in the Lithium space which is why I no longer carry spec stocks in the space. (except BGS which are unlisted options). I'm building for 2020 when I see BIG$

2942 2018-10-04 02:46:38 $12 or more an hour plus monthly bonuses and stocks isn't too bad for a job with no extra schooling required. You want more money go to a trade school or college.
2943 2018-10-04 02:46:35 I lost money in stocks today, my former 1000 became 800. Hahaha. Seems like I'm throwing away money.
2944 2018-10-04 02:46:10 The sum total of what I know about stocks is I put my 401k into Nvidia at 67 the day before an earnings call and my job now is to never touch that investment.

He didnt. Didnt care. It was Obama era. It had to go.

They still haven't even done anything about bump stocks...

2954 2018-10-04 02:42:27 Meanwhile, all that capital trapped in China will keep blowing bubbles in RE, stocks, commodities...etc. For an aging population which needs to save for its future, this adds up to a big problem. Even during good times, a certain amount of capital is always eyeing the exits.
2955 2018-10-04 02:40:24 $TLRY going to the well-what's really interesting is that in order to really trust these cashed-up stocks, you have to blindly trust that they will spend incredibly well.  Our experience is that in these early days, with reg changes monthly, its impossible to spend big and well.

2973 2018-10-04 02:28:01 Just as stocks and all other assets are not in the basket. Look at net wealth for the story
2974 2018-10-04 02:28:01 Did sm's sales of stocks is really drought to the point that, that company gave exols a month of pre-order? I see what u did there #exoot9_comingsoon
2975 2018-10-04 02:27:29 Might as well be at the BMO
2976 2018-10-04 02:26:55 Oh we have. The early 2000’s dot com craze was even crazier. Stocks with no revenue were worth billions and didn’t have a proven concept.
2977 2018-10-04 02:25:23 Don’t sell off your shares yet. Xmas gift of apple/google always good idea. There are some cyber security & fraud stocks that are cool right now. The only social media I’d invest in right now is snap and only because it’s so low. It went public at 24$ it will rebound...I think!
2978 2018-10-04 02:24:38 The existence @blueapron & @MoviePass reinforces trust in #DataDriven businesses. #Analysts hammering these stocks is pure ignorance. @Twitter is a gr8 example of similar circumstances & rebound success, u hv 2b a @Benioff or @Steven_Ballmer  to recognize such business models!
2979 2018-10-04 02:22:39 Let them think they’re being virtually raped. Bio stocks should soar over the next year after these people get medicated.
2980 2018-10-04 02:22:35 Morgan Stanley India Strategy: Q2 starts with market heavily focussed on #Rupee , Crude, liquidity & elections; likelihood is that sentiment improves during the quarter. It’s a good time to re-engage in growth stocks that suffered disproportionately
2981 2018-10-04 02:22:13 I guess if you can’t sell either security before 30 years then there’s no reason to demand a premium for the higher volatility along the way for stocks.
2982 2018-10-04 02:21:50 I’m always looking for some nerdy tech stock tips. @bebes1616 has his 1 share of Apple.  I have Snap and that’s it for tech stocks. I stick with things I know.

2983 2018-10-04 02:19:03 can anyone show sm stocks condition to me? 
2984 2018-10-04 02:18:59 I liked it. Either scenario he sees U stocks rallying significantly.

Scenario 1
6 to 9 months of very big gains.  Cool off, then full bull market 6 to 12 months after.

Scenario 2
Full bull market is starting now and will last for a few years.

End result is the same.
2985 2018-10-04 02:18:26 Thanks Jackson. It is tough when you buy early and hold long but my gains in AJM, PLS, AVZ and AVL always bring me back to that principal.  PLS and AVZ were sold and excellent returns but not meaning a negative for those stocks. Rarely buy but AJM did tempt me recently.
2986 2018-10-04 02:18:25 Stocks will follow their big brother bonds, very soon
2987 2018-10-04 02:17:48  in bonds. Could stocks be next?
2988 2018-10-04 02:17:40 At least with a wage increase they will see more income quickly. Working class people don't worry about stocks or bonuses because, for most, the bills are due yesterday.
2989 2018-10-04 02:16:55 It is going to open more than 80 points down.
1. Crude crosses US$86.
2. US yield rising.
3.Trump threat against India for 5 billion tariff hike.
4.FIIs on selling spree.
5. Rupee keeps falling.
6. Even good stocks correcting, means margin pressure is there.
2990 2018-10-04 02:16:07 I can’t want 7% from bonds when that’s what I want from stocks.
2991 2018-10-04 02:15:34 I’ll enjoy a bourbon and coke with you if we go over 3.5 and we can cry in our drinks cause stocks won’t act so good. In fact it will be downright fugly

2993 2018-10-04 02:14:23 So how high did @SMTOWNGLOBAL stocks now after the release of~EXO's comeback?
2994 2018-10-04 02:14:07 But as I’ve read this was only an option to employees with seniority. People who have been working there for over 3 years. So a huge amount of people didn’t get these stocks or bonuses. But for the people with seniority now they don’t get this perk.
2995 2018-10-04 02:14:06 $SWM 1.025 not for me as im allergic to tv stocks since i lost the lot in the $ten debacle, but for others without 'issues' might be a good earner 60tf
2996 2018-10-04 02:13:45 apple stocks rise by 20%.

3000 2018-10-04 02:10:09 Exactly, plus the stocks aren’t bad and they proved they can hold up adequately against most forward lines. Have the son of Craig Kelly coming in father son who is a CHB
3001 2018-10-04 02:09:32 Although this is very unfair for the people with seniority. For a lot of people 15/hr is really good for them. And you don’t lose your stocks from what I read. You just don’t get new stocks. And other people don’t have to live off foodstamps and barley get by.
3002 2018-10-04 02:09:18 He is not the sole owner of the business, the shareholders are. There is no "greed" here. People but stocks,some windows and prphans, for income, or capital appreciation, they call the shots.
3003 2018-10-04 02:09:08 I admit it. When I mute a goon, I picture that autumnal mead guy getting tossed in the stocks.
3004 2018-10-04 02:09:04 Which are the e-sports  stocks that you recommend to follow ?

3007 2018-10-04 02:08:28 People need to realise that with penny mining stocks that consist of dirt in the ground there is no such thing as “fundamentals”. You can only trade the chart - failure to break resistance on news/bearish engulfing candle/breaking support = gtfo of this stock.

3015 2018-10-04 02:02:15 I'd like to know what stocks are doing so good.  I invested in a few cannibus, oil & gas etc that were suggested by stock advisors.  Only 1 cannubus is moving & in the green.  All others in the red at a minus symbol.  Very disheartening.
3016 2018-10-04 02:01:43 I'd love if you had a you tube series on financial matters. Honestly for real. I think it would be fun to watch and a lot of people do not know anything about investments or stocks. By a lot of people...really I mean me.
3017 2018-10-04 02:00:57 Mb rephrase the question as:  current valuations imply a 2% total return on stocks for the next 20 years - so what return guarantee do you need from the US treasury to insure you will have your savings when you retire?  Bet you get a lot more 3% replies with that one...
3018 2018-10-04 02:00:45 Sir u understood in wrong way.
3019 2018-10-04 02:00:31 I dabbled into the stock market for a bit and found my luck with stocks sucked 
3020 2018-10-04 02:00:18 And mundane companies that have borrowed huge sums and repurchased their stocks are trading above inflated market multiples.  I know how both of these stories end!
3021 2018-10-04 02:00:10 Investors don't actually get money unless they sell their stocks. You're thinking of corporate

3024 2018-10-04 01:56:13 @snatch1218  Hi Mate  Are you a foreigner in Japan trading stocks?
3025 2018-10-04 01:54:55 As for your chart. ***Wall Street is not the economy***

Have you seen wages lately? Have you seen the amount of debt accrued? Nobody is benefitting from record stocks unless they are investors in those companies. That chart is a measure of the wealthy becoming wealthier.
3026 2018-10-04 01:53:20 Please don't share wrong message. Last time u share worst is over for maruti at 7400 level.. but now its tradinding at Rs 7246. So please don't share such stupid view.. nifty fall is not over looking for 10758 with 1 or 2 sessions. May it can touch 10629 level
3027 2018-10-04 01:53:11 You know it's Soros.
But I think he is hurting.  He is resorting to threats when he would first do money.
His payroll is too big now and these elections are costing dearly. He is now forcing others  to pay too,  They will get sick of THAT!

Stocks are staying high which hurt him.

3030 2018-10-04 01:51:35 $SSTI $RUN $CBIS $NXTTF $MJ All stocks that have huge potential in the next month to blast off. 
3031 2018-10-04 01:50:50 That dudes the reasons your stocks are doing so good lol
3032 2018-10-04 01:50:09 If you’re bullish stocks you don’t want rates breaking higher.
3033 2018-10-04 01:47:50 Half of the monthly bonus is only given if the entire building makes plan. Stocks are only given if you last long enough to earn them, but all of that is maybe money that was considered an hourly wage that you don't see.
3034 2018-10-04 01:47:02 Serious question: How is losing the cash holdings that significant? It doesn't disappear like dividends would. It reduces supply and then moves cash into an investment that can then be turned back into cash. When I calculate my net worth I include my stocks.
3035 2018-10-04 01:47:01 I’m part of the group, I also have been part of other groups, but this is totally different, they are teaching us to trade stocks and forex as well, from 2 traders that actually had experience in the market, not crypto turned forex. Tune in to the free streams, you’ll see
3036 2018-10-04 01:46:18 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
3037 2018-10-04 01:46:11 lmao get your stocks up and meet me in la
3038 2018-10-04 01:45:36 But they were totally cool with bump stocks?
3039 2018-10-04 01:45:27 2/3rds of Americans do not own stocks or participate in a 401k.  40% of stocks are owned by foreign investors.   1 in 5 Americans have less than 5,000 saved for retirement. 
So who’s getting rich.   Foreigners and the 1%.

3044 2018-10-04 01:40:07 I do work in a fulfilment center and all full time employee of Amazon got stock awards no matter where they work. I have been a tier 1 associate for 6 years with Amazon and I got stocks every year.
3045 2018-10-04 01:39:32 Don’t praise til you know the real deal! Stocks and incentives are now gone for these hard workers! 10 hrs a day with barely time for the bathroom! @JeffBezos could help his employees more! #withoutemployeesheisnothing
3046 2018-10-04 01:37:47 tell him to just invest in stocks like a normal person maybe???
3047 2018-10-04 01:36:54 The longer you trade, the more stocks you see & think, fuck that...I remember when gxy was 50 rode it to 260 and now its being toyed with at 282 the mentality that a stock is more stable after a certain price point is simply myopic
3048 2018-10-04 01:36:17 So after all the details came out it looks like I will lose about 4500 per year with the new plan and my wife who gets no raise and loses stocks and VCP so she will lose about 6000 per year. So together we are out 10 grand a year. I guess it's time to move on from Amazon.
3049 2018-10-04 01:35:22 Stick to stocks lol
3050 2018-10-04 01:33:38 home depot stocks just plummeted girl

3052 2018-10-04 01:32:29 It was really amusing to me last night that the news of the big retrenchment exercise at Starhub came out the same day people here giving advice to just buy telco stocks if they didn’t know what to invest in
3053 2018-10-04 01:32:29 So hard to find good info on Aussie Weed stocks but I’ve got small positions in $CAN and $AC8
3054 2018-10-04 01:32:25 These weeds stocks are messing with a lot of people

Typical EM bubble stats:
- Debt/GDP rising 120% -> 150%
- Current account 2pp weaker
- Foreign currency debt 45% of GDP
- GDP output gap of +4%
- Stocks rally 20% pa for 3 years 
- Real FX overvalued by 15%
3057 2018-10-04 01:30:30 Wrong Bernie, Most will lose far more of their wages than gained by the raise. Gone are annual stock grants and monthly bonus checks. I lose $4100 to gain $1144. Do not fail the workers now, demand the full return of stocks and bonus checks in addition to the $15
3058 2018-10-04 01:29:47 Thinking or implementing it on the days before results of certain stocks.hope it s the right strategy. Worked well for q1 as you said for liquid stocks.

3060 2018-10-04 01:27:43 Jeff Bezos can afford to pay his employees a living wage,bonuses & stocks. Until the ‘60s corps were viewed as owing something in return to a society that provided legal protections & an economic ecosystem. Globalization &  deregulation put shareholders above all others.
3061 2018-10-04 01:27:39 Yes, keep your back stocks. Back in who you have with Reid, Goldy and McLarty still in the system. Dunn and Shaz will return mid season. Settled lineup to me
3062 2018-10-04 01:26:17 Losers bracket is just last stock.

And last stocks ain't 0 stocks.
3063 2018-10-04 01:25:22 This only benefits new employees, employees like me who have been with the company for some time will actually be making less now because they’re taking our stocks and our monthly bonuses away. 
3064 2018-10-04 01:24:56 It's all the fun of watching stocks with none of the benefits

WHY, in the 21st century, are we still talking about voting booths and paper ballots?
3067 2018-10-04 01:23:27 @amtvmedia Hi Mr. Greene, I enjoyed your video about De-dollarization. Do you think XRP is a good alternative investment to stocks, in addition to gold and silver?
3068 2018-10-04 01:23:18 The real reason buybacks suck because they are almost by definition rent seeking. Self disclosure, I only buy stocks with dividends.
3069 2018-10-04 01:23:07 It is going to open more than 80 points down.
1. Crude crosses US$86.
2. US yield rising.
3.Trump threat against India for 5 billion tariff hike.
4.FIIs on selling spree.
5. Rupee keeps falling.
6. Even good stocks correcting, means margin pressure is there.
3070 2018-10-04 01:22:37 Are you referring to the banks which pay more than the min wage, or a company like Tim Hortons that operates on a razor thin margin?  Companies are not charities. The stocks of these companies fund our RRSPs & other investments but I gather you don't care much for capitalism.
3071 2018-10-04 01:22:18 You went from international bullies to international laughing stocks. Looks good on ya.

3073 2018-10-04 01:19:24 Individual stocks so strong, conventional thinking is to buy all small dips. Seems like a bull trap to me. Am short nq but have stops in overnight. Last night they started buying at 10pm
3074 2018-10-04 01:18:49 Maybe because LIC , being one of oldest investor in Indian equities has good hoard of blue Chip stocks that ensures it perform better among the bad ?
Other insurance cos don't get same scrutiny. Y ?
3075 2018-10-04 01:18:42 You better hurry and cash in now on stocks. I'm finna be buying stocks every week.

3081 2018-10-04 01:15:42 I own stocks, I'm not rich. Just trying to be. Why is that bad again?
3082 2018-10-04 01:14:58 its funny - lot of stocks i follow in mid cap land are trading as though the recession already started - but AAPL at all time highs enough to keep SPY's up I guess - and joe blow gets to see his 401(k) safely flat
3083 2018-10-04 01:14:13 Something is amiss in USA - a day ago Dow 30 stocks was up 193 points while Russell 2000 stocks down 1.39 % trading below 50 day average - more than half of Nasdaq stocks below 200 days averages - only 42 % of Nasdaq stocks above 50 day average ! DOW seems a lone wolf !
3084 2018-10-04 01:13:53 TLT down-spike arguably catalyzed crash in stocks in February. And we didn't have EM/China falling apart back then.  Tomorrow should be interesting.
3085 2018-10-04 01:13:20 15 * 30 * 50 = 22500 though, and the stocks accumulate with experience. Many workers own several shares. If you worked there 3 years, your stock compensation is $2k in capital gains + $2k in a new share.
3086 2018-10-04 01:13:14 I literally just googled marijuana stocks. Investing in all three soon. But damn that's where the money at

3090 2018-10-04 01:10:01 Bought #vtvt today 1k stocks at 4$ , then set a stop loss at 4.20. 
As I'm putting sugar in my tea.
It gets sold and then the stock goes to 6$ . Was the last day trade left. Brutal mistake.

3091 2018-10-04 01:10:01 Sadly most of us don't have stocks or 401k's. Just 3 jobs, lousy h/c insu. W/expenses going up faster than wages.
3092 2018-10-04 01:09:54 Lessons from @Iamsamirarora 1. There are atleast 150-200 stocks out of 500 that make atleast 20% in an yr, we dont need feel left out of a few.    2. There is more money made when “ you lose less money”   3. Concentrated portfolio is always prone to being effected by frauds.
3093 2018-10-04 01:09:51 Consider buying VRX, FCX, NBL, KMI, BTI, MRO, STO, GE or ETP. All great stocks. Some with great dividends and growth potential and guess what?? No flipping fees!! Use ameritrade and it's $7 a trade buy and sell. No more secret hidden fees!!!

3098 2018-10-04 01:07:47 "All of the deleveragings that we have studied (which is most of those that occurred over the past hundred years) eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)." - Ray Dalio

3100 2018-10-04 01:05:54 If I had the funds and the stomach for shorting stocks, $NAVI would have been my top choice awhile ago & would remain so today. They are notorious for deceiving borrowers. They will go down for it eventually.
3101 2018-10-04 01:05:04 Last  trade didn't end up well so far. The 12.5 call is at 100% but the stocks are down more than 50% from 13 to 6. I had 10 puts which I rolled to December..

3119 2018-10-04 00:53:35 We can make a lot of positive changes without even touching that amendment. We had an assault weapons ban before temporarily and we can get bump stocks banned. Background checks, laws requiring safe storage, plus much more is not in violation of 2A.

3127 2018-10-04 00:49:47 Just in case you forgot Gary Dumas, Trump did not win because of majority vote. I imagine you are one of the “tax breaks freeks. You need to speak for the masses who are poor and underpaid. The masses on Main St. Who don’t own stocks.

3139 2018-10-04 00:45:21 I just know they are full of it because our portfolio is diversified and as a whole, it ain’t booming. U.S. tech stocks, which have nothing to do with Trump, are strong but overall, the market could be better.
3140 2018-10-04 00:44:28 They should be working on a 950 horsepower engine.  Hobby Stocks are making 500 horsepower with today's head technology.

3144 2018-10-04 00:41:59 I wonder if the right understands that the left doesn't want to take your guns away, we just think that crazy people, especially all of the spree killing white males shouldn't be allowed to buy automatic weapons or bump stocks. #Idiot

3147 2018-10-04 00:40:57 So you’re missing the point here. He raised wages due to the constant backlash of how he has been underpaying his workers to only take away the stocks and monthly bonuses. This equals to the same amount of pay as before, and for some less.

3153 2018-10-04 00:37:47 Exactly but ignorance is bliss. One should simply ask which is more important, stocks at bubble valuation ATHs or $tnx at 2-2.5%.   I put 10% of my crash puts on today. We’re very close to breaking point.
3154 2018-10-04 00:35:53 Holy Mother, some journalists & editors engage in wicked stock manipulation.

Bloomberg's journos earn bonuses for having an impact on stocks. This incentivizes them to post stories that would either or TSLA.

They post negative stories because negativity gets more attention.
3155 2018-10-04 00:35:31 Oh look /ES down 10. If you bought stocks today...you are doing it wrong. $SPY $QQQ $DIA $TWTR $NVDA $VIX $AAPL

3157 2018-10-04 00:35:14 The entire MSCI was pushed by 6 stocks only  ;-)
3158 2018-10-04 00:33:42 Strategists at Citi put the context for #equities and #riskassets as follows: "Late Cycle, Not End Cycle" The difference is still significant #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks
3159 2018-10-04 00:33:14 Very underwhelming, as usual. Bump stocks still legal? Yup. But he & his party HAVE enabled postcard size tax returns. We simply cannot allow complacency to remain in Congress. #TaxScam2 ? Sure. We need new ideas. A fresh approach. Uncompromised elected officials. #FlipItBlue 
3160 2018-10-04 00:32:30 I’m about to start learning how to trade forex. At the top of the year my goal by December was to be a fluent trader in stocks options crypto and forex ! 3 down 1 to go ! 
3161 2018-10-04 00:31:56 To be fair, it’s quite uncommon for companies to issue that many stocks every year to its employees. If Amazon increases by 20-30% a year, their wage bill would be fluctuating too much and companies need predictability. From a business pov, this is standard. $15 is good!
3162 2018-10-04 00:31:53 With stocks soaring, everyone should be getting huge raises & tons of benefits!!! That used to be the way it worked long ago in the good 'ole days. I was there; companies took care of their workers, we had co. paid insurance, retirement benefits & more! Now, they buy back stocks.
3163 2018-10-04 00:31:37 NAMANANA stocks is up on amazon
3164 2018-10-04 00:31:26 Bonuses and stocks are usually discretionary. The pay increase is reliable
3165 2018-10-04 00:28:03 Not having patience for losser stocks, having an exit strategy.  Quantitative risk management

3170 2018-10-04 00:24:10 Not smart. He probably has a dozen AR-15s with bump stocks and 60-round magazines in his truck. And 3 pit bulls.
3171 2018-10-04 00:23:53 Selecting stocks. @AIServicesCH --XE
3172 2018-10-04 00:23:48 Is that why you still accept blood money from the NRA? Is that why we still don’t have meaningful common sense gun regulation? Is that why we can still purchase bump stocks? Your thoughts & prayers go about as far as they went after the Stoneman Douglass high school massacre.....

3175 2018-10-04 00:22:35 Chance if you ever want to gouge out my uterus and fling it into the stocks and throw into a bucket immediately
3176 2018-10-04 00:22:15 When it's Election time,I am extremely likely to NOT vote for Liberals or any of their preference parties!
I'd like to round up every Lib politician who has sabotaged my career,my town,my state,my country,my environment & my wildlife & put them in public stocks.

3177 2018-10-04 00:21:27 Will point out that HRC always agreed on higher wages, ie, $15. She wanted it raised in phases because many businesses would potentially struggle. I live in the Bay Area. Stocks are the only way people can afford to buy homes. Amazon stock is worth almost 2K a share. 
3178 2018-10-04 00:21:15 @jsp4423 at least they have funds, most stocks this cheap are in huge debt.
3179 2018-10-04 00:18:31 Lost $3.92 in the value of my Robinhood stocks today but that was offset by the $5.80 worth of dividends paid me today.
3180 2018-10-04 00:18:16 my mom just made 20,000 in stocks today and i’m over here stressing over a college education
3181 2018-10-04 00:17:04 Why don't you stop with the "thoughts and prayers" B.S. and do something about gun control? Bump stocks STILL haven't been banned. WTF is wrong with the GOP?
3182 2018-10-04 00:16:51 There has been some reporting concerning bonuses and stocks though, but still if it moves other companies to move to $15 it's a step in the right direction.
3183 2018-10-04 00:15:17 The right stocks matter

3187 2018-10-04 00:12:50 @amazon gives with one hand and takes away with the other. As expected from the morally bankrupt obscenely wealthy, they are taking bonuses and stocks away which will nullify any gain the employees make with the salary raise. #NotMyPresident #OurRevolution #TheResistance
3188 2018-10-04 00:12:44 Haha oh it's just a coincidence all the same people push these paid promotion stocks like $Dati and $Dirv $Afom? I think not, but whatever! I have my own methods I use. Best of luck to all you pumpers!

3190 2018-10-04 00:12:24 120 hours at least it takes me to search snd find the good Possible winners! It is not an easy process and it is never be only a luck! Look could work for some times but not with more than 258 stocks since I started! I am proud to be honest and thorough with you lovely members!
3191 2018-10-04 00:11:59 1. See Japan?
2. I believe increasing pessimism about stocks would —-> bull steepener? But only after big flattener (unless fed rate cuts get priced in)

I’m sure I’m missing something and/or using different textbook.
3192 2018-10-04 00:11:09 $SPPI $AMRN about 8 years ago I got into biotech stocks investment, and these two were my first biggest holdings. How time flies. 

I’d do researching nightly, and trying to understand their studies. Also because I was scared to lose $. 

Congrats to all LT shareholders.
3193 2018-10-04 00:11:03 I'm terrified @realDonaldTrump is going to start using the FEMA alert system the way he uses Twitter. Can you imagine getting 27 texts at 3am because hes on a tirade? Samsung and apple stocks tank bc people turn in their phones...

3195 2018-10-04 00:10:01 A well balanced portfolio should include:

1. Diversified Blue Chip Stocks. 

2. Real Estate. 

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!
3196 2018-10-04 00:09:10 Actually just bad the last 2 Days. I expect it will rebound but will maybe take some good news. It seems that I have been the most contrarian of investors lately because the stocks that I buy, move contrary to my expectations.
3197 2018-10-04 00:08:53 VCP = variable compensation pay aka bonuses.  Double during peak I believe.  A sizable amount of money for most associates. The stocks were very valuable.
3198 2018-10-04 00:08:20 Actually shit the bed is referring to stocks when they tank, in bberg terms usually about 80 bps, not the actual shitting of beds by humans, but I just ran with it
3199 2018-10-04 00:07:47 The damn stocks are down 
3200 2018-10-04 00:07:30 The day before yeah. More of the same today but in different stocks. Not a good look for $XLP / $XLV / $XLB
3201 2018-10-04 00:06:11 As Donald Trump slaps tariffs on China & an economic slowdown looms, foreign investors are coming to the rescue of the nation’s ailing stock market. However, the Chinese equities tumbled after JPMorgan downgraded the nation’s stocks, forecasting a full-blown trade war next year
3202 2018-10-04 00:04:26 @Tiberius009 agree. Given mania in pot stocks akin to block chain &shipper trades, Square dissatisfied w/momo. $SQ I believe it will bounce.
3203 2018-10-04 00:04:19 Okay the right calls all shooters of innocent children or church goers hero’s. They must, doing nothing is condoning. Not even bump stocks. They love their shooters with guns!!
