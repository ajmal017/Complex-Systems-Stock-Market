Creating a scapegoat is a distraction
Not a solution
1 2018-02-21 23:58:46 What are thoughts about #spy testing Low from couple weeks ago and resuming upward trend?  When stocks close to round numbers dont they tend to hit? Close enough to 3000... also, really teasing us with Q4 letter
2 2018-02-21 23:58:28 Is that it?  No bans of bump stocks or cranks?  No repeal of the Dickey Amendment?  No outright ban of assault weapons?  It’s better than “thoughts and prayers”, but it’s not the whole answer.
3 2018-02-21 23:58:25 Oh hell.  He didn't do crap about the bump stocks
4 2018-02-21 23:58:02 It’s about change. There is no reason for any civilian to own an AR15 or any weapon like it, No bump stocks either. This is about selfish people and their sense of entitlement not wanting to compromise. You can have guns, guns that we deem safe for civilian use.
5 2018-02-21 23:57:56 Why can’t bump stocks require the same purchase criteria as suppressors (aka silencers)?
6 2018-02-21 23:57:51 @realDonaldTrump you need to listen to the kids. Imagine if that was your son that didn’t come home, would you just say “ban bump stocks for guns”, no you would want serious change! @Emma4Change #listen
7 2018-02-21 23:57:38 Students demand banning AR-15. Accepting nothing less.  Stepped up vetting, armed guards and bump stocks are not enough
8 2018-02-21 23:57:22 Give all the banned bump stocks to the teachers...brilliant!!
9 2018-02-21 23:57:14 - no more private gun sales 
- buy back & destroy
- no Bump stocks or anything like
10 2018-02-21 23:57:07 I want to buy some stocks for my daughters and gift it to them this Christmas. But again... Thanks again @berthacoombs
11 2018-02-21 23:57:01 He’s approving this move on bump stocks because the @NRA previously said they weren’t against that ban. That came out after the last mass murder in Vegas.  

No real moral courage here. The #GOPNRAAxis is still very much steering the discussion. 

Let’s be clear to expose this.
12 2018-02-21 23:56:33 Was it cod? I think you are referring to lekkerbekjes (="nice-in-the-mouthies"). They were nearly gone, but because of CFA, cod stocks were restored and we have them once again, though more expensive.
13 2018-02-21 23:56:29 Four months after Las Vegas, President Asshat wants to ban bump stocks.  Does this mean he'll go after AR-15s in June?  Hint:  Don't count on it.

15 2018-02-21 23:55:32 We will never be like Australia though. I'm all for banning bump stocks. And making it impossible for rifles to be turned into automatic weapons. I'm also all for mental health evaluations. I do think some things need to change, but a ban won't solve the issues.
16 2018-02-21 23:54:37 Dump stocks?
17 2018-02-21 23:54:28 The main challenge facing the advancement of gun-control is that there is the issue of it being a slippery slope in which initially assault rifles and bump stocks are banned, but then eventually even the simple handgun is being banned.

40 2018-02-21 23:53:55 First they came for the bump stocks, and I didn't speak out because I didn't own one. 

Then they came for all semi-autos but I didn't own one. 

Then they came for bolt and lever actions but I didn't own any. 

Now they've come for me and there's nothing to defend myself with.
41 2018-02-21 23:53:53 Banning bump stocks wouldnt get it done and there isnt one person on the planet that believes what you said, banning assault rifles is something we already have data on and that data says that banning assault rifles lowered mass incidents by 36% and yes you can get the guns back
42 2018-02-21 23:53:50 People need to stop giving homie stocks, if you get blown back afterwards you look stupid
43 2018-02-21 23:53:44 From the Dem: " No one should pretend this bill alone is an adequate response to this epidemic."

Nope. Not strong at all.

You started with me on the hyperbole. Of course I am. I really do want solutions. But background checks and a bump stocks ban doesn't do that.

45 2018-02-21 23:53:10 I guess we should have left those bump stocks out there. He is talking about stricter background checks not letting mentally I'll gave guns and gathering Governors from different states to come up with a solution together. Ya not doing anything you all act like he does not care.
46 2018-02-21 23:52:28 I wonder why the market faded towards the end of the session? I mean all these stocks were very strong today and gave it all back at the end.
47 2018-02-21 23:52:23 You are a silly drama queen. We had background check all the time. Whats wrong w/ enhance it? '
Bump stocks crosses the line to fully-auto. Most gun owners never heard of ut before Vegas. Also discussing issues doesn't mean submitting to liberal will. This GOP Congress is amazing
48 2018-02-21 23:52:15 If machine guns are illegal for civilian use, why are bump stocks legal?  What am I missing?
49 2018-02-21 23:52:14 Brandon, we support his actions for banning bump stocks but that someone had to teach him how to be human, to empathize...is another matter entirely.

Tips to prevent further deaths:
1 - Outlaw bump stocks and any other accessory that easily converts semi-automatics to virtual automatic weapons of war.

52 2018-02-21 23:51:25 I also think that rate of Fire loopholes like bump fire stocks should be outlawed. I understand the need for guns for protections, but a 30 round .223/.556 bump fire rifle is a machine for killing, not protecting
53 2018-02-21 23:50:55 Why should i buy stocks?
#thomasanswers @ThomasSanders
54 2018-02-21 23:50:54 WA Farmers sold out their own members by wanting grain stocks information displayed publicly. Plus never supported their ex-member Mike Baxter in his hr of need. PGA has reached out to Waff on issues but won't again leopard/spots ect...
55 2018-02-21 23:50:18 The problem isn't banning bump stocks, it is HOW. If members of Congress want to risk their reelection by banning them, so be it. Doing so by unelected bureaucrats issuing a "rule" carrying the force of law w/serious criminal penalties is not solely optics, it's unconstitutional.
56 2018-02-21 23:50:06 Except, that wasn't HIS idea  Banning Bump Stocks was proposed by dems after the last Mass shooting and the vote failed because of the GOP
57 2018-02-21 23:49:54 I'm pissed and feeling mean. Given, that the NRA wields a lot of boughten influence, could they please schedule a mass shooting@ at THE WHITE HOUSE. Trump's pathetic solution is for teachers and staff to have guns. Oh yeah, he wants to ban bump stocks? State are doing that now.
58 2018-02-21 23:49:49 Stricter background checks, age restrictions on certain weapons, ban bump stocks, and do away with the gun show loophole. In many states one cannot buy a pistol until age 21 but rather one can buy a semi automatic AR-15 and hundreds of rounds of ammo…

60 2018-02-21 23:48:55 ... there was a D bill on the floor about banning trigger modifications, but they said it was about bump stocks (well then why not state that in the bill, yes I READ the entire bill, even did CTRL-F for bump || stock) and not even mentioned. ...

63 2018-02-21 23:48:19 @megynkelly I challenged you to a debate on your FB page I oppose all forms of gun control including the age limits and banning bump stocks.  Hire Vets to do school security or arm the teachers
64 2018-02-21 23:48:17 Kids are sitting ducks at school.
If we ban bump stocks, kids will still be sitting ducks.
If we ban AR-15s, kids will still be sitting ducks.
If we ban all guns, kids will still be sitting ducks.

Now, can we solve THIS problem?
65 2018-02-21 23:48:07 Nice set up with the Republicans. President vows to support background checks & limit bump stocks & the Congress says “No go, no way.”  #Congress #TrumpListeningSession #BS #Republicans #NRABloodMoney
66 2018-02-21 23:47:50 Ban the large capacity magazines along with the bump stocks.
67 2018-02-21 23:47:38 So if we ban bump stocks are we also going to ban belt loops on pants?  Cause they work as a bump stock as well.
68 2018-02-21 23:47:33 ... I have come up with ideas for BG checks I'll provide to my state and federal reps which won't hurt any of the current ones at all and actually would make sense.  As for bump stocks, I really see no point in them. I back a R sponsored bill in IL for banning them, but only them
69 2018-02-21 23:47:31 President Trump says he wants to ban bump stocks - devices that can turn ordinary rifles into weapons that can fire like a machine gun - such as the one used in the mass murder in Las Vegas last year - He will meet with governors & Attorney Generals from across the country
70 2018-02-21 23:47:28 No. She can't ban assult weapons by a  memo b/c that is against the law. She will need to change it. The memo is to let ATF re-examines it '10 decision on bump stocks. Which they have a power 2 regulate since it turns A.W. 2 fully-auto. NRA supports memo b/c it stops D's big bill
71 2018-02-21 23:47:15 I don’t think what they wrote back them had any idea of how vulnerable our children would be in school bc of Aka’s, automatic rifles and bump stocks.  They were writing about the right to decide to bear arms for or against slavery, not killing multiple people as quick as we can.
72 2018-02-21 23:47:04 I'm sorry people y'all going to have to deal with me talking stocks n crypto until I get hood rich then you will just have to deal with me talking shit
73 2018-02-21 23:47:01 Pre-orders. Limited time. Limited stocks.
74 2018-02-21 23:46:54 Yea Yea we know. Stocks go up its because of Obama. Stocks go down it's Trumps fault. Blah Blah Blah.
75 2018-02-21 23:46:49 I don’t think what they wrote back them had any idea of how vulnerable our children would be in school bc of Aka’s,automatic rifles and bump stocks.  They were writing about the right to decide to bear arms for or against slavery, not killing multiple people as quick as we can.
76 2018-02-21 23:46:48 No, taking guns is NOT the agenda.  RNC has been saying that for ages & it’s a lie.

Banning Bump stocks will do little, 
Why should a kid be able to buy an AR15 when he’s on a no-fly list & cannot buy a handgun?

Cutting ACA & changing Obama’s mental health EO did not help!
77 2018-02-21 23:46:33 Obama’s Dir. of ATF laughed at bump stocks when he approved them for purchase.
Parkland shooter didn’t use bump stock.
Children (13 yr olds) cannot purchase a gun. 
No one can purchase a gun w/out ID.
You’re wrong all over the place.
78 2018-02-21 23:46:33 in addition, my highschool has campus cops, and i think it would be helpful to have campus cops at EVERY HIGHSCHOOL, i have never felt safer than i have with our campus police. so, ban bump stocks, assign cops to guard every highschool, problem solved i guess.
79 2018-02-21 23:46:19 When was the last mass shooting with a fully automatic weapon (bump stocks don't count)? Can't remember? Hmmm, it's almost as if restricting access to some weapons has been successful...
80 2018-02-21 23:46:10 Memes are laughing stocks
81 2018-02-21 23:46:01 It shouldn't be only ARs. In fact, no one would say it should be "only ARs." High capacity magazines, silencers, bump stocks, armor piercing ammo, etc. should also be banned. Then we can work on the regulatory/logistical side of it.
82 2018-02-21 23:45:42 Tank Stocks  

Force everyone with a retirement plan (401k, IRA, ROTH, etc) to increase allocation to "safe" treasuries.  

Remember that advisors to qualified plans are now DOL fiduciaries.  You will have no choice.

84 2018-02-21 23:45:22 I need to look into dividend stocks.....
85 2018-02-21 23:45:08 Renew the assault weapons ban add that, bump stocks. Easy.
86 2018-02-21 23:45:07 Trump isn't going to touch the 2nd amendment. But, there are things that can be done. Bump stocks should go. Not allowed to buy a gun until 21 ok with me. I support Trump.
87 2018-02-21 23:45:04 Here in DC arriving @i24NEWS_EN studio to join @MichelleMakori I think it’s 80 degrees outside. Feels like Miami. Lots to discuss. Late day sell off. What’s worse for stocks?  #inflation or #washington
88 2018-02-21 23:44:02 after i said this i hadn't realized that bump stocks can turn a semi auto gun into an automatic weapon. I also learned that people with fully automatic weapons are put on a watch list. so in a sort of contradictory way i think the problem here lies with bump stocks.
89 2018-02-21 23:43:46 Help us stand up for the Second Amendment, call the White House at (202)-456-1111 today and tell President Trump that he should oppose the expansion of federal background checks and oppose the ban on bump stocks.
90 2018-02-21 23:43:05 Mmmm. Actively working with congress to ban bump stocks? Since when? He was in FL until Mon/Tue unable to golf because of the inconvenience of optics.  We all know he sings his own praises loudly. Must have missed his tweet.
91 2018-02-21 23:42:47 Hey @IvankaTrump, dude, with all due respect:

Please stop advising your Dad to make dumb moves like bombing Syria and banning "bump stocks". Americans don't want this stuff to happen, and it's going to hurt America if you keep doing this.
92 2018-02-21 23:42:31 Yeah. Facing down/describing the stuff you carry but don’t look at can be WILD. There’s a reason every therapy room I’ve been in stocks tissues.

95 2018-02-21 23:41:32 He should have done this after Las Vegas.  I guess it wasn't the time then.  Bump stocks had nothing to do with Parkland.  #neveragain
96 2018-02-21 23:41:22 Make bump-stocks illegal
97 2018-02-21 23:41:17 i think a good middle ground in this whole school shooting thing could be

1. Ban all bump-stocks from ever entering or being sold in this country, because bump stocks make semi-auto guns essentially fully auto

2. Make it mandatory for ALL high schools to have campus cops
98 2018-02-21 23:41:04 Trump: "Let's ban bump stocks and increase background checks for those trying to b-"
*NRA check clears*
Trump: "I mean, arm all teachers. Let's make sure every man woman and child has a gun. Firearms all around. The only solution is more guns."
99 2018-02-21 23:40:59 No. Even the NRA said that 'bump stocks' which turns legals (semi-auto to full-auto) ought to be stopped through agency regulations. Not by an act of Congress (as liberals will demand ban on semi-auto). This is a smart move that cuts liberals out. 
>Trump has been good on 2nd AMT
100 2018-02-21 23:40:59 @realDonaldTrump
#BanAssaultWeaponsNow 

And bump stocks

for all guns sales - thorough background checks and a waiting period

And, NO guns in schools. That’s a recipe for horrid accidents!
101 2018-02-21 23:40:58 How can trade 5 stocks together in the same day 
102 2018-02-21 23:40:52 I believe the trick they have come up with is sacrificing bump stocks to save their precious AR-15. Beyond the comprehension of caring citizens. 
103 2018-02-21 23:40:11 So, did he tell the NRA that he was going to ban bump stocks, but "don't worry, you'll be selling more guns to teachers!"
104 2018-02-21 23:39:56 $SVY Is in my top 5 stocks. I have been holding for while now. Highly recommended for anyone interested in L.T holds it ticks all the boxes 
105 2018-02-21 23:39:43 @POTUS @NRA As a concealed carrier, law abiding citizen and NRA MEMBER, I have always thought we needed better background checks, three-day waiting period, end of bump stocks, and 21 to purchase gun. @FoxNews
106 2018-02-21 23:38:42 The NRA killed the Congressional attempt to ban bump stocks. They've opposed even the most innocuous gun control measures, like background checks and the Assault Weapon Ban. 

They are complicit.

108 2018-02-21 23:38:19 This is a good time to remind your investment advisor that you don't want to own any stocks, ETFs, funds, or bonds that profit from making or selling guns and ammunition.
109 2018-02-21 23:37:59 It does seem a technical analysis biz. The 10yr goes from 2.89 to 2.95 and stocks drop 450 Dow points. So that’s become a tech anal biz too. Maybe I’m too old for it.
110 2018-02-21 23:36:51 “That’s a stupid idea” 
Yeah, ok... so then should we just do nothing as per usual? You do realize he also assigned Jeff Sessions to work on banning bump stocks, right?

114 2018-02-21 23:36:17 You think his base wants the Obama administration approved bump stocks outlawed?  Asking for a friend..
115 2018-02-21 23:35:57 How about we let them have nothing, especially since it doesn't just apply to bump stocks, but anything they deem to be a similar device, such as echo triggers, etc.  Done letting people slowly pick away at the 2nd amendment.
116 2018-02-21 23:35:53 @am640 who's this John guy on the air? I'm sure he owns tons of oil and building stocks. Open up greenbelt for more construction? Really?   Expand oil extraction? Thank god conservatives won't be elected any time soon.
117 2018-02-21 23:35:40 Our schools *DO NOT* need to be turned into militarized zones. We need automatic & semi-automatic weapons banned. We need bump stocks banned. We need universal healthcare so people can get proper mental health treatment. Most importantly, we need caring people in this world!
118 2018-02-21 23:35:31 I hear stocks are going up in the gun industry and cowboy hats....I'm proud to be Canadian...
119 2018-02-21 23:35:30 I mean, the NRA has opposed any limitations on guns including bump stocks.
120 2018-02-21 23:35:20 Why doesn’t traders just withdraw coins off the exchange. This ain’t stocks. Find out who swimming naked. No supply to cover.
121 2018-02-21 23:34:47 Agreed.

The LV shooter had numerous rifles, with scopes and bump stocks, and large capacity magazines.  

We can do better than just an Assault Weapons Ban.
122 2018-02-21 23:34:41 Yeah. You'll ban bump stocks. Great
123 2018-02-21 23:34:31 If Congress made “ bump stocks illegal TONIGHT, it wouldn’t stop the VIOLENCE! That’s like doing major surgery WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE & spoon ! DJT politically encouraged the violence with those rallies. We need to WATCH, WORK, & DEMAND BETTER GOVT. & NOT buy into the B.S.
124 2018-02-21 23:34:24 Get your bump stocks b4 our government takes them away
125 2018-02-21 23:34:12 Retweeted Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod):

Trump banning bump stocks is like banning phone chargers when the phone is the problem.......
126 2018-02-21 23:33:54 Bump stocks had nothing to do with Florida shooting FBI failed to follow up
127 2018-02-21 23:33:50 Background checks and bumper stocks ban is totally not enough. Outright ban of Assault Weapons is the only way to make a difference. Look at Australia, they banned assault weapons and that was it for mass shootings, gone!
128 2018-02-21 23:33:45 Please gimme the stocks for next month to gege ayee 8D
129 2018-02-21 23:33:21 Smaller bullets. Bump stocks. Background checks. Mental evaluations. Everything except banning guns. Am I in the twilight zone? #ParklandStudentsSpeak
130 2018-02-21 23:33:16 The 2nd amendment is the right to have not need. I’m just saying....... so much shit is going to go down if they take that away. I do agree bump stocks for civilians are not needed but they sure are fun.
131 2018-02-21 23:33:15 What the right had gives (ban on bump stocks), the left hand takes away (Arm teachers and take away gun free zones) - LOGIC certainly was never one of his strong suits, was it?
132 2018-02-21 23:32:54 Thanks for reminder about executive action opening door to lawsuits.  Nothing this president does is altruistic.   Agree, Bump stocks  ban is insufficient  and executive action is a con job.

135 2018-02-21 23:32:08 Bump stocks are useless ....keep up good work
136 2018-02-21 23:32:07 Obama didn't have to go through the house and senate to ban bump stocks.  He just had to do it.  And he never bothered.  Why?
137 2018-02-21 23:32:03 Tomorrow
138 2018-02-21 23:32:00 Yesterday: Increased background checks and bans on bump stocks are half measures, at best, but at least Trump is proposing SOME productive change. 

Today: LOL NVM.
139 2018-02-21 23:31:47 #GunControl is (among other things):
1. Stricter background checks
2. Banning bump stocks
3. Banning automatic weapons such as the AR15.

#GunControl is NOT the "Men in Black" knocking at your door and demanding you hand over your licensed and legal weapon.
140 2018-02-21 23:31:32 The shocking thing for me tho is this... Obama never even bothered to ask the Dept of Justice to ban bump stocks.  Trump has already done more than Obama ever did on gun control.
141 2018-02-21 23:31:14 Jesus fucking Christ, trump *considers* banning bump stocks, a thing five fucking people have, one of whom is dead, and I have professional democrats in my timeline ready to shine his fucking shoes.
142 2018-02-21 23:31:08 This is a terrible idea that won't go through. His suggestion to bad gun stocks and raise the age for obtaining a AR-15 are good.  I just wish we could go a little further by banning aasult weapons altogether.
143 2018-02-21 23:30:52 Sadly his statement on Bump Stock is just show really,  the ATF/DOJ already declared during the Obama Admin that they couldnt regulate bump stocks without new legislation,  

So unless Congress passes something on them, you wont see that change,
144 2018-02-21 23:30:34 Even if Trump imposes stronger background checks, bans bump stocks & raises the age for purchasing guns, still won't fix the gun issues!
145 2018-02-21 23:30:29 Another down day on Wall Street, need a strong finish to the week to stay in the green for 2018.

146 2018-02-21 23:30:25 The bump stocks worked well enough in Vegas, and well enough that months later POTUS is trying to look like he's doing something by limiting access to them.
147 2018-02-21 23:29:45 - Raise minimum age to buy a gun
- Thorough background checks for ALL gun purchases
- Ban Bump Stocks
- Ban Assault Rifles, if you don't want to take it that far, then push for a special certifications to purchase one that involves thorough bg check.

#ParklandStudentsSpeak
148 2018-02-21 23:29:43 What Trump said was pure NRA properganda.

No mention of banning guns. In fact he wants more, to put them in teachers hands. More background checks and ban bump stocks. 

Only banning sales and removing all guns from the community will work. No guns without special licences.
149 2018-02-21 23:29:32 I see yields are mean, in red stocks’re too 
 I see them blow up for me and you

151 2018-02-21 23:29:16 The ban on bump stocks is a violation on the 2nd amendment we the people have the right to have the same weaponry as the government and military why shall the American people be enslaved by the rich and belittled and have our rights taken away #traitor
152 2018-02-21 23:29:12 I am proud to be a stocks holder #COLFinancial
153 2018-02-21 23:28:46 For the record:
A) Banning bump stocks is t/bare minimum that he could do
B) He should’ve done this after Las Vegas, why did it take 17 dead teenagers and teachers?
C) He hasnt actually done anything about it yet, lets hold the handjobs until after something is signed and passed.
154 2018-02-21 23:28:43 Bump stocks were not at the Florida school murders.
155 2018-02-21 23:28:43 (well sorta) Because Remington wrote "the kids are not alright, they are actually crisis actors" on all bump stocks, such equipment is granted first amendment protection!
156 2018-02-21 23:28:15 Trump may push for band-aid bill on bump stocks just to stifle the masses so the cronies may get through Nov election.
#NeverForget
157 2018-02-21 23:28:11 a gun is a tool, & is useless until put in the hands of someone with ill-intent. Banning the tools won't solve anything. I agree, there should be extensive background checks, longer wait period, an end of selling bump stocks, & other measures meant for military use.
158 2018-02-21 23:28:05 STOCKS-Рынок акций РФ поднялся во главе со Сбербанком

161 2018-02-21 23:27:22 These need to go along with bump stocks ....
162 2018-02-21 23:26:46 Trump has went from ban bump stocks to full NRA arm the teachers propaganda in less that 24hours.
163 2018-02-21 23:26:44 It’s a combination of this and stronger school security, banning semi and bump stocks,, clearing FBI burocracy and overly PC procedures ,increase mental health services .
164 2018-02-21 23:26:35 Why are bump stocks and cranks still legal after Vegas? It's a win for Dems and Repubs! Why can't we do that at least?!
165 2018-02-21 23:26:01 Banning bump stocks won’t be enough #GunReformNow #NRA #NationalSchoolWalkout
166 2018-02-21 23:25:59 There are multiple solutions but when you can’t even get bump stocks banned or loopholes closed you can thank the stranglehold of the NRA
167 2018-02-21 23:25:01 The patterns I look for are stocks that have been crashing hard recently, and then I wait to see if they pop back up above the moving average line. The companies needs to also have good news and hype around it too. Then I will buy and hold for a few hours or just a day then sell
168 2018-02-21 23:24:30 Your friend did, who you've liked several times in this thread.  And after he did you make the bizarre claim I don't know what a bump stock is.  If you don't think that bump stocks somehow lower the bodycount then I'm sorry for assuming so.
169 2018-02-21 23:24:23 It would be nice if folks who don’t like guns just got a little educational assistants about them. The same gun with wood stocks and same fire rate and power would be used to do the same thing. I know you’re not just racist of black guns right.. kidding. But really
170 2018-02-21 23:24:14 So dumb that even in this situation he has to be told what to say by his donors and minders 

Only reform which may come out of this tragedy is banning bump stocks The assault weapon that the white terrorist used on the kids& teachers in Parkland will remain untouched
171 2018-02-21 23:24:11 God bless your little pea-pickin’ black heart, Jay. Does the good lord above help you pick your stocks?
172 2018-02-21 23:24:10 Also trump is pushing  through a bill that will  make all bump  stocks and other devices that make normal guns into automatics  permintly banned  and illegal
173 2018-02-21 23:24:09 I know its a semi automatic that fires as fast as the trigger pulls. Better yet it can be modified with bump stocks, genius.
174 2018-02-21 23:23:49 You know what's amazing.  With all the shootings under Obama.  Obama did even less than Trump on gun control.  Didn't even bother to ban bump stocks.  And all he had to do was ask the Justice Dept to ban them (like Trump just did).
175 2018-02-21 23:23:10 And the saddest part of all is that BOTH sides of the aisle CONTINUOUSLY acquiesce to the will of the NRA. There will be no change. Perhaps a small bone like yes to bump stocks as a trade off to permitting across state line concealed carry permits. #LostCause
176 2018-02-21 23:22:57 Trump got together with the NRA and was told what they’d accept. They’ll give up bump stocks if he says we arm teachers now. They are a manufacturer’s lobby group, they aren’t representing ordinary gun owners.
177 2018-02-21 23:22:37 Let’s see if we can find common ground what justification is there for anyone outside the military or law enforcement to possess a military assault weapon and high capacity clips bump stocks etc?
178 2018-02-21 23:21:55 Trump saying he wants to ban bump stocks reminds me of this kid in the afterschool program where I taught who never, ever behaved, then one day did for all of 30 seconds, and I praised him to the moon and back. The bar's just so low at this point.
179 2018-02-21 23:21:37 Me personally. 

Ban Assault rifles, and bump stocks, they have no place on the streets of this country.

Will it make a difference?
I don't know, and frankly I don't give a fuck.

The" @NRA way" has lead to many assault rifle killings since the ban was lifted, and...
180 2018-02-21 23:20:49 And if it matters, as a Marine I practiced fire discipline. Bump stocks are idiotic. Full auto is a tool for gaining fire superiority but worthless for anything but defense. Single pull, one round all day long. But then again, I'm trained, I respect law and liberty.
181 2018-02-21 23:20:40 Arming teachers is not the answer. In fact, it’s a stupid and utterly ridiculous suggestion. Trump is fronting, NRA in his back pocket, he won’t impose shit minus ban on bump stocks. America, your children lives mean fuck all to the @GOP
182 2018-02-21 23:20:38 We can ban bump stocks, raise age to buy to 21, increase background checks and even ban AR type weapons. Where you are wrong Sir is the opposition to increasing our defenses at schools. There are MILLIONS of other guns - must protect our schools with armed guards.
183 2018-02-21 23:20:15 Yup, those would definitely kill the exact same amount of people. Don't know why the Mandalay Bay shooter went with bump stocks when he could have hit 900 people with a Toyota Camry.
184 2018-02-21 23:19:45 I see some people think Trump is doing something because of his #bumpstock announcement. That’s just a shiny object to distract and pacify.

He could’ve moved to ban bump stocks after the #LasVegas shooting. #Parkland wasn’t about bump stocks - the issue is #AR15s.

185 2018-02-21 23:19:31 I am fucking glad...........glad that President  Trump is pushing a bill to ban and make illegal  all bump stocks and devices that make everyday guns into automatics

188 2018-02-21 23:18:32 Trump is working on bump stocks,Mental health and security. So let’s give him a chance to do the right thing. To have a sit in meeting with the parents of the school shootings past and present is a start and a first for a President.

191 2018-02-21 23:18:07 BAN the sale and ownership of AR 15 to civilians, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity ammo clips, universal background, close gun show loopholes.

194 2018-02-21 23:17:38 Bump stocks don’t make them auto but I don’t really care if they ban bump stocks. Banning an ar style rifle does nothing because hunting rifles are the same thing. A couple handguns are even more dangerous but at least we won’t have scary looking guns #LiberalLogic
195 2018-02-21 23:17:23 "We". Not all US citizens hold your opinion. Even the President seems to be starting to move on the issue, preparing to ban bump stocks. This might be the start of an uprising against gun ownership, that could bring the US more into line with other civilized Western democracies.
196 2018-02-21 23:17:13 He could do bump stocks on his own but it wouldn't last
197 2018-02-21 23:16:56 @drboycewatkins1  what do you think about Robert kiyosaki's sentiments about investing in stocks, bonds, etc.??
198 2018-02-21 23:16:55 Full disclosure.  I don't advocate for any fully automatic weapon or bump stocks to be legal.  I want better background checks and more security in schools.
199 2018-02-21 23:16:38 No chance.  House Republicans shut down Democrats' attempt to bring the bill banning bump stocks up for a vote. But they do plan to vote on making it easier for foster kids to gain access to guns. So, there you go.
200 2018-02-21 23:16:08 He would advocate that too if he had stocks in tobacco companies.
201 2018-02-21 23:15:59 Dump that dog..energy stocks
202 2018-02-21 23:15:58 FYI, Obama's administration approved bump stocks. 300m firearms in America, tragedies occur. Banning firearms will not change tragedies from occuring. This conversation in Washington will go away in a week. SORRY 2ndAmd = freedom from tyranny.
203 2018-02-21 23:15:51 We can call bump stocks and the GOP will regulate it.
204 2018-02-21 23:15:47 ???? It has to so with all this "It's Trump's fault" and NRA nonsense. No one seemed interested in banning bump stocks or AR15s during his 8 year, but now they are?
205 2018-02-21 23:15:38 Bump stocks turn semi auto weapons into automatic weapons?
I've seen this lie in the media 6 times in the last 24 hours.
There needs to be some gun legislation. Spreading fear only makes the gun lobby dig in deeper.
The left is being incredibly stupid and overreaching.
206 2018-02-21 23:15:10 Terror gap bill (2016): bill to add terrorist suspects to anti-gun registries; killed by NRA

Automatic gunfire ban (2017): would have banned bump stocks and other additions which make weapons fire automatically; killed by NRA who claimed it was an ATF regulation (it wasnt)
207 2018-02-21 23:14:53 Or maybe DOJ/ATF recognize that there’s no rational basis on which to ban “bump stocks.”
208 2018-02-21 23:14:53 Music to gun manufacturers. Will their stocks go up tomorrow.
209 2018-02-21 23:14:49 @wolfblitzer Trump won't do anything that would hurt NRA support, but no elimination of things like AR-15s, bump stocks, high capacity mags
210 2018-02-21 23:14:41 Did you notice it took him 4.5 months to propose banning bump stocks? He has no motivation for this job but doesn’t want to risk angering his base/future Trump Network subscribers.
211 2018-02-21 23:14:31 THAT'S NOT A "AK47"....... ITS A "CHEAP SKS".........THOSE MISTAKES MADE THE AK47 FAMOUS TO SCARE PEOPLE JUST LIKE THEY ARE DOING WITH BUMP STOCKS AND AR15'S NOW........
212 2018-02-21 23:13:47 I really really hope that this schoolshooting will make a turningpoint in US history, but at the same time i’m thinking: how do you get rid of those millions of rifles and bump stocks?

213 2018-02-21 23:13:46 yes, they do control all 3 branches. 
 and Trump just had one of his executives (Atty General) ban bump stocks
and he is assembling the congress to re look and address age requirements for some nomenclatures of firearms, and stricter background checks
214 2018-02-21 23:13:30 I truly cherish our second ammendment and wish it not to ever be infringed upon, however, bump stocks...over 21 for ar15 rifles...transparency between agencies.....definitely needed.
215 2018-02-21 23:13:23 Vegas and parkland.  but you keep saying they aren't fully automatic but bump stocks do just that.  its not even a gun.  nothing says you can have fully automatic.  i repeat, join th emilitary if you want to play with them

217 2018-02-21 23:13:17 You misunderstand my beef. I wholeheartedly support his action to make bump stocks illegal.
218 2018-02-21 23:13:14 Okay. AR-15s are not manufactured or shipped with bump stocks. So, do you mean that bump stocks should be illegal instead of the AR-15?
219 2018-02-21 23:13:03 "Shall not be infringed" includes bump stocks and other accessories....
220 2018-02-21 23:12:26 @wolfblitzer meaning he will discuss background checks he will discuss bump stocks he will put armed teachers in schools but that's it
221 2018-02-21 23:12:10 Dude Trump’s legislation he just signed to ban bump stocks has much more teeth than any of the legislation Obama passed 

Are you sure it’s not just the fact that it’s coming from Trump that you don’t like it
222 2018-02-21 23:12:02 posted a rant when @MissAuroraSnow posted something on this basically im against bump stocks and i want more screening for mental cases, illegal aliens, & criminals and when the states or law enforcement fuck up like they did here they are held accountable for it
223 2018-02-21 23:11:44 Thank you for understanding the issue here. If members of Congress want to risk their reelection by banning bump stocks, so be it. They must not surrender their lawmaking power to unelected bureaucrats to create a "rule" w/the force of law and serious criminal penalties.
224 2018-02-21 23:11:29 @realDonaldTrump Why are you talking about bump stocks! This is about a shooter with an AR15 why are you not talking about that!!

232 2018-02-21 23:10:14 Trump doesn't have a heart. ..... BTW, bump stocks should have been banned long ago, after the Las Vegas shootings.

234 2018-02-21 23:10:09 President Trump signs the directive calling for a ban on bump stocks.
Trump announced Tuesday he signed a directive to ban devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons.

236 2018-02-21 23:10:01 @GregAbbott_TX  your directive to TEA re school safety is ridiculous.  Schools already have safety plans in place.  Stop blaming the victim and pass legislation raising the age to buy gun, extend waiting period, ban sales of auto ammunition and bump stocks, 6 month waiting period
237 2018-02-21 23:09:54 Pretty simple to me. We live in a society that nurtures the proliferation of guns. Ban assault weapons, create stringent background checks for all gun purchases no exceptions, forbid the retail sale of guns except through licensed dealers, outlaw bump stocks. #BanAssaultWeapons
238 2018-02-21 23:09:33 I dont care if it was a fairy wand.  it should be banned.  it shows up at every mass shooting.  that and Bump stocks.  its not relaly that big of a surprise
239 2018-02-21 23:09:13 I’ll believe it when he signs it into legislation. Until then it’s bullshit and most likely All they will do is ban bump stocks and declare victory without pissing off the base too much. He’ll throw his shoulder out patting himself on the back.
240 2018-02-21 23:09:11 Obama tried to pass many gun regulations during his tenure. Bump stocks got through because they, as opposed by other devices, didn't alter the interworking of guns. So keep reading and quit saying nonsensical information.

244 2018-02-21 23:07:56 Trump enjoyed this press moment to make himself look like he cared & was actually considering taking bold, meaningful action, but he won’t do a thing- & he won’t ban bump stocks because he can’t do it by himself and he knows it. He  was obviously pushing armed guards in schools.
245 2018-02-21 23:07:23 I know I’ll get flack for this but I’m prepared. I’m pro 2nd amendment. I think we need to have guns. HOWEVER. I am for the banning of bump stocks and extensive background checks.
246 2018-02-21 23:07:21 At least trump is now for banning bump stocks and improving background checks. He is better than u on this.
247 2018-02-21 23:07:08 Besides bkgnd chks (incl. within families), bump stocks, nat'l DB, & assault rifles must be focused on. ONLY these would help much!
248 2018-02-21 23:06:51 Bump stocks should absolutely be banned, but they are also not the real issue. #DemandAPlan #ItsTime
249 2018-02-21 23:06:49 I read an article once that analyzed the stocks of gun companies and they ALWAYS rose after a school shooting so it doesn’t surprise me at all that the right supports guns so strongly. Sad that we can’t care about lives instead of pushing agendas.
250 2018-02-21 23:06:02 Thanks H that’s a good read 
I was actually asking about Tungsten stocks $SEI $VML were a few that got mentioned..as I believe tungsten demand will be aligned with #EV technology..
251 2018-02-21 23:05:55 what are stocks and how does it even work #ThomasAnswers
252 2018-02-21 23:05:36 Much as I think he’s incompetent, you have a solid point that his base is surprisingly solid. Add to this the gun regulations on bump stocks being implemented, and more neutral liberals will probably concede this point to him.

254 2018-02-21 23:03:37 By “considering” he’s actually being told what to say and do by Wayne LaPierre. And if anything does get signed—like banning bump stocks? It’ll only be to put off any real conversation/action about regulation and banning assault weapons. In short: 45 can fuck off.
255 2018-02-21 23:02:39 This wasn't a listening session to stop kids from getting killed in schools! 

This was an infomercial for NRA to sell more guns to all teachers & stop bump stocks from bleeding profits off REAL AR assault gun sales.

Trump Guns. A new brand. Cha Ching.
256 2018-02-21 23:02:28 Like how he supported banning bump stocks after Vegas? Not buying it until I see some actual legislation getting signed.

260 2018-02-21 23:01:52 Legislation is the only answer for it; meaningful bipartisan legislation. Not legislation that bans bump stocks, or other empty symbolic gestures.
261 2018-02-21 23:01:38 Don’t you see our cries?
The death of innocent lives,
Which you care nothing about?

Banning bump stocks isn’t going to do anything.

Because at 18 you can still buy a military weapon

And that is where the problem lies.

There is no need for military weapons for civilians.
262 2018-02-21 23:01:35 Obama and the Democrats (with the 2 "Independents" Sanders and Lieberman...) Could have enacted any gun control laws they wanted in his 1st 2 yrs.. Why didn't THEY do something then?! Or try to block bump stocks?
263 2018-02-21 23:01:31 Trump banning bump stocks is like banning phone chargers when the phone is the problem.......
264 2018-02-21 23:01:21 Forgive me
Comments:
1) Many economists warned this WILL HAPPEN
2) Does this help middle class households?(NO it does NOT)-Execs own the stocks
3) When executives receive more stock, they will sell stock & invest in their own company-> Creating jobs (HELL NO)
Thank u GOP/Trump
265 2018-02-21 23:01:11 @realDonaldTrump I didn't HIRE you to restrict my freedoms more.  Bump stocks have nothing to do with these shootings.  But I bet the FBI and CIA do.  Remove Gun Free Zones and see how far these killers get.  Investigate your own Deep State too.
266 2018-02-21 23:00:47 @realDonaldTrump BAN THE BUMP STOCKS. ALL FOR BETTER BACK GROUND CHECKS. STATES W/ OPEN OR CONCEALED CARRY WRONG, NATIONAL CONCEALED CARRY W/ 1 WEEK TRAINING,
267 2018-02-21 23:00:45 Trump banning bump stocks is like banning phone chargers when the phone is the problem..
268 2018-02-21 23:00:38 Criminals will be criminals from the beginning of time til the end of time.   Now with everything we have said.  I am a firm believer that there are certain guns, bump stocks and accessories that should NOT be readily available to the general public.  Stricter gun laws I’m for.
269 2018-02-21 23:00:29 @realDonaldTrump BAN Bump,Slide stocks and all semi auto rifles.  Do it NOW we do not have time to wait for your balls to drop.

270 2018-02-21 23:00:23 You're making a pretty irrelevant point. 

UK stocks had been overfished prior to joining the EEC and most of the catch is sold to the EU. True or not?
271 2018-02-21 23:00:10 I only found out about this sh-t after Andray wrote a mini-thread a couple days ago. 
The thing that bugs me is there may be no real incentive for Twitter to change course. (They just posted a 1st-time profit in terms of stocks.)
272 2018-02-21 22:58:37 The narrative is that #stocks slid today on this idea the FOMC didn't have the Jan. jobs report wage data and thus their inflation views in #Fedminutes are anachronistic. NFP was publicly released only 2 days post-Fed confab. Is it possible the Fed was already aware of the data?
273 2018-02-21 22:58:27 Imagine if Barack Obama banned bump stocks via ‘executive memo’ ... 

How would the #BigTalkers react?
274 2018-02-21 22:58:26 what are stocks? 
275 2018-02-21 22:58:17 I wouldnt argue with you, its pointless, you have your own agenda. Google fair fishing, See where the boats are from. There decimating all stocks around this ciast.
276 2018-02-21 22:57:19 #ThomasAnswers what are stocks? How does one go about trading them?
277 2018-02-21 22:57:05 Over & over & over, elected officials offer thoughts & prayers in place of action (whatever happened to the bump stocks ban?) & sometimes even as they enact legislation that does more damage.  Spare me the faux outrage. & are U implying only Christinans think & pray? Gross.
278 2018-02-21 22:56:58 Get off this Russia crap and on with more useful issues. Metal scanners at all schools, clear back packs would help, ban assault weapons and bump stocks for a start would be great
279 2018-02-21 22:56:41 People  find  a  way  if  it’s  banned  or  not  

Drugs are illegal but people are dying from overdose 

Ban bump stocks and someone hell bent on mass murder will find a way to alter their weapon.
280 2018-02-21 22:56:31 there will NOT be any gun ban pass this congress ... i'll BET on that .. they may do some other things like ban bump stocks & improve background check databases ... hopefully the #Conservatives will force them to include a national concealed carry provision to get that thru ...
281 2018-02-21 22:56:29 @ledgerstatus dude whats the name of the ichimoku indicator that lets me switch between crypto/stocks settings? Cheers
282 2018-02-21 22:56:19 Trump is an NRA stooge. 

What's needed is very strict gun control. Which is very much what the NRA does not want. 

Trump offers peanuts:  ban bump stocks, give teachers guns, mental and background checks. 

Nothing about banning ownership. The NRA is very happy today.
283 2018-02-21 22:56:12 Finally it looks like someone will do something to fix this problem and I'm sure Congress will be more than willing to pass this bill from the President with banning bump stocks and funding to train teachers in the use of a firearm and end visa lottery
284 2018-02-21 22:56:05 BTW, it has NOTHING to do with pension funds.....your 401k may have gone up drastically, it may not have.....depends on which stocks you own.
285 2018-02-21 22:55:30 Sales if bump stocks will be be up 500% before ANYTHING happens if at all. Kudos to the kids!!!! STOP the slaughter!!!
286 2018-02-21 22:55:07 @realDonaldTrump Don’t forget it’s not just mass shootings at schools, what about churches, restaurants, shopping centers, groups outside a Casino hotel! No semi auto Weapons. No Bump stocks, and No auto weapons except military/ Police! Mass is the key word!
287 2018-02-21 22:53:54 Really??? How many are killed in cars? How many kids died in bombings? How many in knife attacks? FYI the NRA has no problems with banning stocks. What about the weapons and drugs that flow across the border? Lets take their guns first.
288 2018-02-21 22:53:37 @WarrenDavidson -as a life long Bill Buckley conservative, 2 things:   

1) Bump Stocks need to go - "spirit of the law"  

b) A DACA deal is a repub. win (with appropriate qualifiers). Minor I.A.s are already here, already paying taxes, and pissed at dems.  Make it happen!
289 2018-02-21 22:53:20 To say that he is not doing anything just really proves how much you hate this President.  It would not matter what he says you would still find something insulting to say.  He did take a step. He outlawed bump stocks and other devices that make a rifle automatic.
290 2018-02-21 22:53:17 @realDonaldTrump First I've been a big supporter thus far but have some questions now.  Why the actions on bump stocks? 1. Vegas shooting was done with full auto not a bump 2. It's not guns remember? 3. If we can't trust you to protect the 2A here where else can we not trust you?
291 2018-02-21 22:53:14 Bump stocks should have restrictions which most people and @NRA agree with. What exactly are military type weapons?
292 2018-02-21 22:52:21 All Trump wants to do is change the background checks a little bit and look into taking away the bump stocks. That is not enough. We need to ban assault rifles and high capacity magazines.
293 2018-02-21 22:51:47 Unless they want to ban bump stocks which requires allegiance to Gun Owners of America
294 2018-02-21 22:51:44 “I really just wanted extra boxes of crayons—“
“Here are a couple of bump stocks too!”
295 2018-02-21 22:51:31 im not confused.  that was just one idea.  Lets ban Bump stocks, assault weapons, AR 15, semi automatic.  Don't try to play semantics.  lets take all these military grade weapons and ban them.
296 2018-02-21 22:51:21 legally armed so gun stocks will make money
297 2018-02-21 22:51:14 Bump stocks are being banned, case closed. Nothing more to see here!
298 2018-02-21 22:50:53 Why can't we just ban "bump stocks" and assault rifles? ..... No one is talking about taking guns away that are already out there! That's what the NRA wants gun owners to believe.  Just stop selling the damn things! They're not for defense!  They're weapons for combat.
299 2018-02-21 22:50:52 FOX @johnrobertsFox VERY INDIGNANT That Our @POTUS Hasn't Outlawed Bump Stocks..OR GUNS OUTRIGHT -IT SEEMS HE'S ASKING FOR HERE AT THE WH @dailybriefing What Is Roberts DEMAND Here? That US Pres. Doesn't Need any Counselors? DO IT BY FIAT? .This is America -2nd Amendment STANDS..
300 2018-02-21 22:50:48 no bump stocks. 3 round max mags.  Sales of guns AND ammo AND accessories (mags, etc) go into database.All acts of violence and mental instability go into the database.

Just a start.
301 2018-02-21 22:50:37 I’m very glad @POTUS has finally come around on bump stocks, & that some Republicans are seriously discussing gun safety measures, albeit minimal. We must continue to hold @GOP’s feet to the fire, especially now that there are specific openings, like Sen. @marcorubio
302 2018-02-21 22:50:20 @PrimetimeWFNZ David Tepper's Appaloosa just dropped about $1 billion 
David Tepper's Appaloosa went big on pharma stocks in the fourth.                                  He invests in Drugs that are brain-damaging babies and children. Not a worthy Panthers owner. SOUNDS CRAZY.
303 2018-02-21 22:50:00 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.

307 2018-02-21 22:47:41 Trump solution is throw some crumbs like bump stocks, raise age for assault guns, something for mental health, etc., but will see in a month or two what happens. Root cause is guns period.
308 2018-02-21 22:47:00 The Dow finished Wednesday 86 points below Tuesday's low. It was the 2nd day in a row that The Dow had closed beneath the previous day's low. The run last extended to 3 days on 30 December 2016, 287 trading days ago #stocks
309 2018-02-21 22:46:54 Thanks for your opinion but i think the shooter in Vegas thought bump stocks had a different purpose like shooting as many people as possible as fast as he could
310 2018-02-21 22:46:51 NRA already called for banning bump stocks(2017)and the need for armed security at schools in (2012). Clearly, if the FBI investigated they would have confiscated Nikolas Cruz’s guns and this tragedy would have been avoided. Hopefully, future armed security will be more competent
311 2018-02-21 22:46:02 I have zero problems with President Trump banning Bump Stocks.
312 2018-02-21 22:45:42 He'll have to check with the NRA before he does anything. Trump was safe speaking out against pump stocks because the NRA is ok with that.
313 2018-02-21 22:45:37 Thank you
314 2018-02-21 22:45:33 His approval will go up because of this stunt. Big deal, bump stocks are banned.

317 2018-02-21 22:45:22 @POTUS Please defend the 2nd Amendment. Don't be sucked in by the ignorant cry baby Liberals that want to ban semi auto guns. Bump stocks & AR15's are not responsible for these deaths..The sicko 19 yr old,  FBI & local police are....

SHOP - @Shopify 
(Soon) GAME - @millesports 

RT!
319 2018-02-21 22:45:04 Fair enough.  They used a 9mm Tec & sawed-off shotguns they practiced w/ to get used to them, rather than Armalite clones w/ 30 rd magazines & bump stocks that require less time to get acclimated.

I can’t imagine what you went through at Columbine, BUT (1/2)
320 2018-02-21 22:44:35 Banning bump stocks is not unconstitutional. Other than that it is all in unconstitutional.
321 2018-02-21 22:44:15 it'll be fine, DT will keep them from using bump stocks
322 2018-02-21 22:43:44 Watch trump conn those family into thinking he care and is looking into it bump stocks that should have never have been legal in the first place funny now we're doing something and getting nothing done the conn kill time hope it goes away.the republican way of government.vot
323 2018-02-21 22:43:34 Chicago is right next to Indiana where you can buy ARs with bump stocks and explosives.
324 2018-02-21 22:43:26 He did call to ban modifications of stocks on guns, it's some kind of start, but look Congress plays a big role here, why do you think Obama couldn't as president
325 2018-02-21 22:43:23 I have no problem making it tougher for people to get guns. 
Mandatory 10 day waiting period while people are background checked. Ban bump stocks.
Close the gun show loophole. 
It will stop a lot of this senseless killing.

Attack the teachers pension fund now Judd. They own gun company stocks.
Idiot.
330 2018-02-21 22:41:42 Most assault rifles cost range is more like 10 to 50 grand. The cost you are referring to is the price of an ar15. Also, nra approved regulating bump stocks

332 2018-02-21 22:41:38 Sack Jeremy (C)Hunt. Then put him in the public stocks for a few days -no point taking him out at night. Let him sit in the dark and cold and think of the death and misery he is responsible for.
333 2018-02-21 22:41:36 He's ordered the Justice Dept to look into banning bump stocks and I believe he's also come out on favor of stronger background checks
334 2018-02-21 22:41:31 Bump stocks, yes. I don't see a need for them. But, if someone is smart enough to rig it to become full auto? Can't stop that.
335 2018-02-21 22:41:27 Stocks close lower as Fed minutes trigger volatility
336 2018-02-21 22:40:54 @BetteMidler Trump just did more to advance the gun and school shootings debate than Obama ever thought about doing. Remember, Obama made bump stocks legal, just the opposite of helping. Must kill people like you left wing hacks! Who only care about yourself!
337 2018-02-21 22:40:39 How much SNAP is Kylie short? Tbh, I would invest in a Kardashian HF that buys or sells stocks ahead of tweets/IGs. Would crush it.

340 2018-02-21 22:40:14 Bump stocks?! NOT ENOUGH! All assault weapons need to be banned!
341 2018-02-21 22:39:52 @realDonaldTrump Wow A president that agrees to ban bump stocks. Had black lives matter been funded to provide a thousand dollar reward for the arrest of violent criminals. Would be a real investment. An important investment. Powerful meeting. Some great ideas.
342 2018-02-21 22:39:46 We have given up stocks and are now a curling centric society
343 2018-02-21 22:39:21 I'd just let it all die down then. 'Bump Stocks' ban in 6 months (if there isn't another massacre before then) & 1000 tweets from Trump congratulating himself on getting more done than Obama ever did. Or...
344 2018-02-21 22:38:54 Ban bump stocks
345 2018-02-21 22:38:51 They say they support heavy regulation, but it’s a lie. They supported ending bump stocks, but month later rescinded. They’re also claiming the AR-15 isn’t and assault rifle, even though Clinton’s 94 banned their sales. The NRA hasn’t been genuine about anything
346 2018-02-21 22:38:47 As anti trump as some people are, I’m surprised they aren’t trying to argue in favor of keeping bump stocks legal

348 2018-02-21 22:38:31 I find it hard to believe that the founding fathers could anticipate assault weapons, high capacity mags and bump stocks.  They had muskets.
349 2018-02-21 22:38:23 But Jon....you are in the Wild West! They have had a gun culture for 150 years! A balance is needed. Ban Bump Stocks that create multiple firing...yes..but handguns and single shot rifles no..because too many criminals have them. At least Trump's doing more than other Presidents
350 2018-02-21 22:37:59 I think some of you are missing what he is saying. I am a supporter of the 2ndA but there are a couple of things that can be done right away; 1 bump stocks need to go 2 raise the age for all guns to 21. If you aren’t old enough to drink or rent a car you don’t need a gun.
351 2018-02-21 22:37:40 Yeah ill be fine mate thanks for your concern. Surprised about @DanTame19 like though after that defensive shit show by Leeds 
352 2018-02-21 22:37:32 These are good ideas:

- Banning assault weapons and bump stocks
- Universal background checks
- Focus on mental health

Trump's ideas:

- wants teachers and coaches to carry guns
- wants to send a company of armed veterans into schools
#ParklandStudentsSpeak
353 2018-02-21 22:37:24 If you research my timeline, it is extremely clear I can’t stand Trump. I agree with universal background checks, gun violence restraining orders, raising age to 21, banning bump stocks & mental health reporting. But you’re not going to infringe on my constitutional rights.
354 2018-02-21 22:37:20 Then we can't stop at bump stocks. The AR-15 has been a common thread in way too American deaths. Instead of getting rid of accessories that make the machine more deadly, why can't we get rid of the machine itself?
355 2018-02-21 22:37:16 We need gun CONTROL. Background checks, restrictions on purchasing semi-auto and automatic weapons, bans on bump stocks, restrictions on how many weapons you can have, ETC. No, we aren’t trying to take away your precious fucking guns that you only touch once a year.
356 2018-02-21 22:37:15 Trump has announced bump stocks illegal to purchase/use. He also is wanting to raise the age requirement for those that want to purchase any firearm to 21. Haven’t heard him state that he wants schools to be a war zone.
357 2018-02-21 22:36:57 Now that's the spirit of Cramerica. Booyah! @EconGlobal #WallStreet #stocks #investing #markets #trading #traders
358 2018-02-21 22:36:57 Okay we've had another school shooting and we need a way to stop them happening, any suggestions?

Ban Bump Stocks?

Proper Gun Control measures?

MORE GUNS!

...

Have a seat in congress 3rd person!
359 2018-02-21 22:36:23 I cannot imagine anyone on the Right (with a conscience) buying Twitter stocks. For shame if they do.
360 2018-02-21 22:36:11 Do it quickly put a bill for bump stocks and training teachers and end the visa lottery
361 2018-02-21 22:35:58 I am absolutely promoting a middle-ground. Even @realDonaldTrump appears poised to ban bump stocks via regulation & appears supportive of bipartisan legislation to improve background checks. Close the gun-show loophole & you have compromise that doesn’t touch the 2nd Amendment.
362 2018-02-21 22:35:57 The get bump stocks.
363 2018-02-21 22:35:31 Banning bump stocks is a good idea. It's not an affront to the Constitution. A semi-automatic is designed to be exactly that, NOT a machine gun. The licence to have a semi, is NOT a licence for a machine gun. Pretty simple really. #Trump #WednesdayWisdom #WeStandTogether
364 2018-02-21 22:35:19 @realDonaldTrump  suggestions on keeping our schools safe. The Sandy Hook Promise program works, please use this. Raise the age of gun ownership to 21. No bump stocks, no guns of war, no large ammo magazines. Listen to these teenagers, they are speaking the truth.
365 2018-02-21 22:35:14 Ban ALL types of assault weapons...and bump stocks and flame throwers...yes you can order those online....
366 2018-02-21 22:35:05 Je crois que l'accueil a été trop positif, le tweet a été supprimé, sans doute par manque de stocks.
367 2018-02-21 22:34:57 .@POTUS OPPOSE ban on bump stocks. HR 34 is what we need! #MAGA #DonaldTrump #Opposebumpstockban
368 2018-02-21 22:34:29 The nra was ok with regulating the stocks after Vegas happened. But yeah, they’re evil because of that
369 2018-02-21 22:34:06 Incorrect...Trump has said he's opening to looking at background checks and also taking action on bump stocks.
370 2018-02-21 22:33:49 The AR15 is NOT an assault weapon by any definition - it's for hunting small game and target shooting. Bump stocks were originally developed (2010) for disabled people who still wanted to shoot but were unable too.
371 2018-02-21 22:33:47 Mr. President I've been a long time supporter and this is the first time I really question you.
But do you really think getting rid of a spring device like a bump stocks would stop anything? It's easy to make them so I don't think a ban would do anything to someone who wants one.
372 2018-02-21 22:33:45 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell on Wednesday.

378 2018-02-21 22:33:31 @realDonaldTrump So ban assault weapons and bump stocks, build more schools and institutions. Creating jobs along the way.
379 2018-02-21 22:33:21 #ParklandStudentsSpeak No one so far has suggested a national database that the NRA is preventing. Law enforcement wants & needs this. Only one person brought up banning assault weapons & bump stocks (?). We have way too many guns in our country. Hunters want to hunt, no problem.
380 2018-02-21 22:33:20 As I said, stocks go down bonds go up.
Stock-market rally vaporizes as 10-year yield climbs to 2.95%, dollar strengthens.
381 2018-02-21 22:33:16 Bump stocks are cool but doesn’t hurt me
382 2018-02-21 22:33:14 @realDonaldTrump 

Help stand up for the Second Amendment, call the White House at (202)-456-1111 today and tell @potus that he should oppose the expansion of federal background checks and oppose the ban on bump stocks.

If that number is busy, then call 202-456-1414.
383 2018-02-21 22:33:02 There's going to be a lot of confusion about the recent Minneapolis City Council action so let's be clear: They are urging #mnleg to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, etc. There is no change to city policy or state law.
384 2018-02-21 22:33:00 “Yes I own stocks. I also like going to the race track.” ~Burt Malkiel
385 2018-02-21 22:32:53 Assult weapons ban works, could you imagine the Columbine massacre if they had access to AR-15's,  High capacity magazines, & bump stocks?
386 2018-02-21 22:32:35 It is a good first start. And next ban assault weapons and bump stocks, now.
387 2018-02-21 22:32:34 You are an inspiration to all of we adults. Don't give up. Stand your ground. Don't give in. The #NRA is already starting their change the narrative messaging, w/#Trump now supporting banning bump stocks and #NRAIsATerroristOrganization  surrogate on @CBSNews agreeing min. limits
388 2018-02-21 22:32:20 The nra already said hey were in favor of regulation of the bump stocks
389 2018-02-21 22:32:00 Looks like we'll have a re-test of those early February lows after today's reversal.  Most of the top performing stocks still holding up pretty well
390 2018-02-21 22:31:47 Trump's solution to the issue of gun violence in schools right now appears to be:

1. Banning bump stocks
2. Arming teachers

That's it. He thinks that'll pretty much solve the problem.
391 2018-02-21 22:31:46 FYI. The teacher w gun narrative is also to get folk to stop talking directly about the shooting last week. Lad Vegas ( memba that) switched to bump stocks not how 1 dude pulled it off.
392 2018-02-21 22:31:33 Well here is Trump, not listening..lol  He is talking about mental health issues, and arming teachers.. sigh.. how about putting legislation to ban semi automatic assault rifles like the !R-15 and bump stocks and put an age restriction on the age of a person who buys a gun?
393 2018-02-21 22:31:32 #ParklandStudentsSpeak
Great, look at institutions and #BackgroundChecks BUT ALSO LOOK AT BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS. It's too damn easy to get those type of weapons. @POTUS
394 2018-02-21 22:31:32 5) Buy gun stocks
6) Buy cyber school stocks

Obviously in jest.
395 2018-02-21 22:31:28 I, for one, support deeper background checks for gun purchases; banning future sales of Assault Rifles; banning bump stocks. I also support our 2nd Amendment. But, the writers had muskets, never dreamed of what we have available today.  #guns
396 2018-02-21 22:31:20 Growth and income funds are typically considered value as well. The philosophy of a growth and income fund is that it's usually invested in large cap companies who also pay nice dividends. These are often referred to as blue chips or value stocks
397 2018-02-21 22:31:19 Want to do something personal to fight the gun manufacturers? If you have 401K/etc, ask your financial advisor to take your money out of any stocks with guns. They can and will do it.
398 2018-02-21 22:30:59 Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for initial step with bump stocks. Please recognize assault weapons have no place in our society. #neveragain
399 2018-02-21 22:30:42 And what's your f'n solution to this problem?  And banning assault weapons and bump stocks isn't going to do it. Beefing up B/G checks isn't going to do it either 'cuz private sales DON'T require B/G checks.  And what about "black market" & "straw purchases"?
400 2018-02-21 22:30:41 Trump has to do EXACTLY what the NRA tells them to do on guns. The NRA supports background checks and banning bump stocks, as well as arming teachers. That is all he will offer.
401 2018-02-21 22:30:22 I heard what he said.
He said he wanted bump stocks banned, and any other device that can turn a semi auto in to a full auto.
And I will CERTAINLY 'fuck with trump' on any issue I disagree with.
He is no more the 'MESSIAH' than obummer was.
And you would be wise to accept that.
402 2018-02-21 22:30:10 @CharlesSchwab,Mary From Denver is a freaking gem!!! She helped me out so much and helped me understand my schmoney & stocks! #GreatCustomerService! #ThankYouMaryFromDenver.
403 2018-02-21 22:29:50 We don’t need more guns! We need gun control! Ban assault rifle, ban bump stocks! This is two things we can do without adding more guns to our communities! The NRA would love more guns, this is not about the NRA, protect our kids and our communities , stand up America 
404 2018-02-21 22:29:36 Oh they're definitely gonna do that or assign a vet to patrol every school campus. They'll combine that with something that further stigmatizes people with mental health problems. 

still gonna be able to buy an ar15 and bump stocks tho
405 2018-02-21 22:29:27 Could you imagine how much more worse Columbine would have been if they had AR-15's and bump stocks?
406 2018-02-21 22:29:24 Removing bump stocks from the world is a great fix for stopping deranged people from killing people in gun free zones.
407 2018-02-21 22:28:47 Concealed carry? Rather than ban semi automatic weapons,bump stocks,raising age to purchase guns, Trump is talking about having teachers,undercover cops/retired cops carry at school? Damn never thought I'd see the day that school would become armed camp.
408 2018-02-21 22:28:25 Alyssa Milano,  YOU are getting drawn into LIES.  Assault weapons have been banned for many years.  Do your homework.  Break away stocks and model names DON'T make a gun an assault weapon.  Being automatic, that's when you can hold the trigger down and it will continue firing.
409 2018-02-21 22:27:46 What are you going to do with all the stocks you bought with them now? :)
410 2018-02-21 22:27:32 What needs to be done is to;  
1. Immediately ban Semi Automatic Assault Rifles. 
2. Ban Bump Stocks.  
3. Close the Loop Holes that exist at Gun shows. 
4. Extensive Universal Background Checks.  
Anything less is BS. It's time for action not talk. #AMJoy #CNN
411 2018-02-21 22:26:59 More guns is NOT the solution. Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump these are the only solutions.
412 2018-02-21 22:26:50 I love the last paragraph "Jesse believes that in post 2009, stocks go up and that is good, but that at some unknown point in the future they might go down and that could be bad"
413 2018-02-21 22:26:43 This would be subject to availability whilst stocks last Sophie 
414 2018-02-21 22:26:43 Your boy Barack Obama was the one who legalized bump stocks in the first place. #fact
415 2018-02-21 22:26:09 Just need the #StockMarket to dip for two more days. That’s all I’m asking. #Stocks #MutualFunds #Investing #Money
416 2018-02-21 22:26:09 Bump Stocks = BS to distract.

Surely he means:   'Extreme Vetting'  

Don't worry folks, "We will be 'Extreme Vetting!
Yes! Extra Extreme, who knew it could be so Extreme!! Believe me "
417 2018-02-21 22:26:04 I am proud of @POTUS for so my this.  We have an opportunity for change here.  Every state should put in place extreme risk protective order processes, and if @POTUS makes proper extensive background checks and bans shit like bump stocks, we can make a difference here.
418 2018-02-21 22:25:49 Wondering the same thing & believe they've all been coached (adults too) to respect the "office" of the presidency even if they dislike him. Or they wouldn't have been allowed to speak to him. What will be interesting will be how quick he lets this all go. Bump stocks will be it.
419 2018-02-21 22:25:23 @tarapalmeri  Check your facts, bump stocks do not turn rifles into machine guns. MGs are belt fed not magazine fed like rifles and can fire hundreds of rounds per minute. The best marksman with a bump stock can't do that. Not having the facts is why no one has trust in #MSM
420 2018-02-21 22:25:00 I started investing in stocks in 1984. I started as a pro in 1994. The Dow was trying to get to 4000. I did financial crisis and dot bust. I’m actually one of the most experienced traders in the world. That’s how I got here buddy.

423 2018-02-21 22:24:25 @GOP Vote them all out of office, Florida. After the Tylenol poisoning scandal legislation and packaging was changed within months. We can do this America. Sensible gun control (no AR-15, no bump stocks, better background checks) will not hurt anyone.

425 2018-02-21 22:24:21 Talk done.....now, ACT....get the ban on military style weapons....ban the bump stocks...limit magazines to 6 shells...end crank triggers....allow gun companies to be sued....outlaw anything that turns a semi automatic into a full automatic.....buy back guns on a national basis..
426 2018-02-21 22:23:49 e.g. calling for a ban on bump stocks; transparent as a superficial attempt at a token appeasement.
427 2018-02-21 22:23:46 Republicans need to get out of the pocket of the NRA and do what is right for the country. Close the gun show loop hole and ban bump stocks is a start in the right direction. Or maybe it is time to repeal the 2nd amendment and turn gun legislation over to the states.
428 2018-02-21 22:23:27 Bump stocks are silly, they could go away.  Taking away the Obama era reg was stupid.  On magazine capacity; you served just like I did.  How quickly can you do a mag dump and reload? Higher capacity magazine actually tend to malfunction more than lower ones.
429 2018-02-21 22:22:58 Oh thank god, this kid is talking about banning bump stocks and certain guns.. Fucking finally!!  thank you kid!
430 2018-02-21 22:22:30 Oh.  I only knew about the bump stocks thing.

Well, I can only hope we don't get another AWB.
431 2018-02-21 22:21:52 Pls get facts straight. Trump repealed Obama era gun checks that would have made it difficult for mentally ill people to obtain guns. ANY gun control legislation proposed were blocked by #Republicans who are bought by NRA. Let's hope Trump succeeds in banning bump stocks.
432 2018-02-21 22:21:47 I ain't talking about the bump stocks thing. I'm talking about this meeting that's happening live right now.
433 2018-02-21 22:21:46 If The Stocks Treat Me Well I Will Be Purchasing Thousands Of Bucket Hats And Donating Them To The Local Schools So That The Impoverished Kids Are Working It

439 2018-02-21 22:20:59 He's already proposed a re-evaluation of the laws regarding the legality of bump stocks.
440 2018-02-21 22:20:56 what needs to happen right now is a federal restriction on hi capacity magazines for all assault style weapons AR's and AK's, Fal; HK, etc, also folding stocks. California has had these restrictions for years successfully.

442 2018-02-21 22:20:53 I'm afraid so. I know flattery is a technique that seems to work but in this instance I doubt it. The NRA wouldn't tolerate further concessions beyond  'looking at regulating bump stocks' or background checks. The only result will be to undermine the credibility of the leaders
443 2018-02-21 22:20:51 You start with prevention: mental healthcare, background checks, banning bump stocks and assault riffles. Do it now POTUS @Congress40th #CommonSenseGunLaws #ParklandSchoolShooting
444 2018-02-21 22:20:48 If only we all carried AR’s with bump stocks 247. Then no one would get shot, amirite?
445 2018-02-21 22:20:37 @realDonaldTrump's only gun control measure will be renaming bump stocks "Trump stocks"
446 2018-02-21 22:20:11 Let them have "Bump Stocks". All they do is make a weapon inaccurate. I believe most people can pull a trigger fast enough not to need one.
447 2018-02-21 22:20:02 Fully agree any progress is better than none, I just hate seeing so much credit given to what amounts to almost nothing (e.g. NRA saying bump stocks should be banned/regulated). But yeah it does seem like this issue is gonna be small steps or no steps
448 2018-02-21 22:19:52 #ParklandStudentsSpeak
How about instead of arming our teachers and putting up numerous checkpoints/metal detectors ... WE HAVE #GunReformNow ... how hard is that to ban assault weapons and bump stocks?
@realDonaldTrump solution: ARM THE TEACHERS.
449 2018-02-21 22:19:43 I'm just saying, this was the legal reasoning at DoJ. Perhaps we ought to direct some of this blame at the NRA, as they so rabidly attack any limit on gun rights that the Govt really has to pick its battles. And I don't recall any public outcry about bump stocks before Las Vegas.
450 2018-02-21 22:19:38 He should be put in stocks in the public square with a sign displaying his crime against  NATURE!!
451 2018-02-21 22:19:31 @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  Conceal and Carry for Teachers and others is not only solution. More is needed to end it. You need to ban the Assault Weapons.  You need to ban the Bump Stocks. YOU NEED THIS ALONG WITH THE conceal & carry.  POTUS  YOU NEED BOTH.
452 2018-02-21 22:19:31 i think we are looking at furious get me out of the world's worst stock market tomorrow morning and we can buy that dip on level's on many stocks and sell the rip. market getting back little oversold.
453 2018-02-21 22:19:30 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors, #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Mandatory mental screening, gun safety training before gun sale. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
454 2018-02-21 22:19:26 And banning bump stocks
455 2018-02-21 22:19:25 Here's a few of "crazy" ideas: 
1. get guns off the streets. 
2. ban the sale of bump stocks. 
3. make assault rifles inaccessible to the mainstream public.
4. demilitarize the police force. 

#ParklandStudentsSpeak #ListeningSession
456 2018-02-21 22:19:24 skippity bop ill be ur top
457 2018-02-21 22:18:56 ARMING TEACHERS DOES NOT SOLVE MASS SHOOTINGS.

BANNING ASSAULT RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS HELPS STOP MASS SHOOTINGS.
458 2018-02-21 22:18:53 Of course! 
All weapons stocks went up minutes after the shooting.
459 2018-02-21 22:18:22 Bump stocks? High capacity mags? Any thoughts? How do you feel about the law Trump signed overturning the Obama-era policy of identified mental illness being a bar to gun ownership?
460 2018-02-21 22:18:21 That was one incident involving bump stocks..  I don't think these kids will be distracted.  They are smart enough to know assault weapons, period, are a huge part of the problem.
461 2018-02-21 22:18:16 Why is no one at the White House suggesting that assault weapons and bump stocks and silencers be outlawed?
462 2018-02-21 22:18:05 I see bump stocks, then I see more regs. Get off my rights! It's not only a right, it is an OBLIGATION! I care more about those who are willing to freely give up rights than I do mental Health patients. An America filled with corruption and anti-American,  isn't AMERICA!
463 2018-02-21 22:18:03 @NRA already considered getting rid of bump stocks so eliminating them isn’t action. #GunLawsNOW
464 2018-02-21 22:18:00 who wants to bet, the outcome of this Trump 'listening session' will be that the only recommendations that will go forward is MORE guns (arming teachers).  Background checks, raising the age and banning bump stocks or assault weapons will go by the wayside. The guns win again
465 2018-02-21 22:17:44 i sometimes use wallpaper imgs, and stocks from gfx packs, some cc's, smoke, and other effects. for this one though, to make the shape, i just used one stock img
466 2018-02-21 22:17:41 I do believe and is perfectly logical that the more you do well on stocks the more you desire a longer health span!
467 2018-02-21 22:17:36 So, I’m honestly confused.  If Trump is serious about his comments regarding bump stocks and background checks; why can’t he write an executive order?
468 2018-02-21 22:16:32 Dear sir, you are absolutely maddening. Enough monitoring. Throw down some common sense gun violence prevention bills. Your statement about preventing bump stocks pales in comparison to you supporting carry reciprocity between states. Choose life.
469 2018-02-21 22:16:31 He has no intentions of doing anything. Hes just saying what he thinks hes supposed to say. Then he will not do a damn thing. He will pretend the "bump stocks" thing will be enough, and even that will be dropped liked with Vegas.
470 2018-02-21 22:16:10 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors, #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Mandatory mental screening, gun safety training before gun sale. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
471 2018-02-21 22:16:01 DT should have banned bump stocks after Las Vegas. This is Parkland - ban AR-15s. #ParklandFlorida #BanAR15
472 2018-02-21 22:15:55 Or we could just ban AR-15 guns and bump stocks....
473 2018-02-21 22:15:53 With all the attention on NRA lobbyists (rightfully so), we need to be just as concerned with Gun Owners of America GOA. It seems many have left NRA for GOA BECAUSE after Vegas the NRA sent out a memo considering banning bump stocks.  What is wrong with these people?
474 2018-02-21 22:15:34 Prediction: Congress will pass a minor gun bill (like banning bump stocks) but will tie it to cutting funding for school lunches.
475 2018-02-21 22:15:23 He's selling more guns guess his NRA stocks are going up
Yes make the schools a war zone..
476 2018-02-21 22:15:15 @realDonaldTrump executive orders to increase the age to 21 to purchase a firearm, extensive back ground checks and out law bump stocks.
477 2018-02-21 22:15:06 The Background checks narrative is basically a distraction from the Stocks news.
478 2018-02-21 22:14:54 By enhance the NICS do you mean universal background checks, or something else? How about someone who raises no red flags, like the Las Vegas shooter last fall? Maybe we should ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines?
479 2018-02-21 22:14:42 Be sure to tell them "bump stocks" are not enough.  It must be all assault weapons. It must mirror Australia.
480 2018-02-21 22:14:38 I bought 2 stocks about 2 weeks ago, hopefully it hasn’t peaked
481 2018-02-21 22:14:27 It makes no sense to allow them to sell AR 15 under any circumstances. This is OK for military, not civilians! No kits, no bump stocks either!
482 2018-02-21 22:13:41 Just remember Obozo signed the ok for bump stocks in 2004. Stop being so ignorant HATER
483 2018-02-21 22:13:38 I NEVER own any of those stocks that shoot up 35% or 98% or 24% after the close....

i have owned plenty of the ones down 32% and down 43% and TRADING HALTED FOREVER though...

484 2018-02-21 22:13:38 And trump is fixing to ban bump stocks which makes semi auto guns fully auto

489 2018-02-21 22:12:54 So there will probably be no rate hikes in 2018... and we can go back and buy stocks....
490 2018-02-21 22:12:47 compassion yes but my problem is every time this happens people blame the gun and not the person using them or the conditions that caused it to happen do i support a ban on bump stocks YES do i support denying people with mental issues violent criminals and domestic assults yes..
491 2018-02-21 22:12:36 No bumps stocks, but semi-automatic weapons are now considered US citizens
492 2018-02-21 22:12:30 Fed confirmed they'll raise rates throughout the year. Interest rates up, Stocks down. Simple shit guys
493 2018-02-21 22:12:30 Would banning bump stocks be a good thing? Serious question.
494 2018-02-21 22:12:10 Ban bump stocks + 999 gaZEEELION dollars for the bigass Mexico paid for wall + cover the WH in gold veneer + kick out all brown ppl ... DEAL!
495 2018-02-21 22:11:51 Gonna have to sell my Disney stock and buy up gun stocks. Who is gonna watch a Disney movie when they have to worry about their own teachers having a gun in their desk?  #ListeningSession
496 2018-02-21 22:11:46 He really is. All has is spoken about is banning bump stocks. Did you know that in Israel one has to be 27 to buy a gun & after one obtains a gun license they are only allowed one firearm. I honestly don’t think that they are going to do anything about this.
497 2018-02-21 22:11:31 White privilege is me complaining that my local grocery only stocks mild and medium salsa never hot.
498 2018-02-21 22:11:30 Bottom line.  If you take NRA money you are gone. I don't care how it's laundered it to you. I don't care if you get it by carrier pigeon. You are gone. If you do not support the Banning of assault weapons you are gone. If you do not support Banning bump stocks you are gone.
499 2018-02-21 22:11:14 Someone at Mar a lago this weekend must told him it was a good to ban bump stocks. Remember that’s how @realDonaldTrump makes his policy. #WorstPresidentEver
500 2018-02-21 22:10:39 If you ban bump fire stocks what is going to happen to those who have them? Asking for a friend. @realDonaldTrump
501 2018-02-21 22:10:36 So Trump moves forward with banning bump stocks, is open to stronger background checks, and hosts a listening session with survivors but y'all still mad lmao
502 2018-02-21 22:10:31 Some Nonhumanangels do not want to be like Jesus Christ when they are born through Humans but, they want to be like me. If you know Christianity and Catholic are False Companies, why are you investing in False companies? Why are you buying Christian and Catholic Stocks?
503 2018-02-21 22:10:23 I too have no issue with removing bump stocks. Voice of reason puts words in our mouth and then debates them. How about you listen to what we are saying. I want a gun to defend my family in times of danger.  What has changed in our society is value for life. We've always hadGuns.
504 2018-02-21 22:10:05 Yeah dumbass @realDonaldTrump Ban assault weapons, High capacity mags. Install  BG checks with teeth.
  Bump stocks are a no-brainer.
505 2018-02-21 22:09:58 The "No Bump Stocks, No Immigration from Mauritania, and 10% Corporate Tax Rate Cut Bill"
506 2018-02-21 22:09:52 Banning stocks is a good baby step. Then ban assault rifles and sales to those under 21, those who have police reports on violent behavior, and multiple weapons brought over a certain period of time.
507 2018-02-21 22:09:48 Big shout out to @Papa_Stocks for calling $FIEC & $HNET from the lows, epic picking 
508 2018-02-21 22:09:24 dt asked for a solution from kids/parents.The senior from Parkland was excellent-brought up Australia that handled their situation after only 1 school shooting&have had none since.Fake prez then gives a thumbs up-took 5 months for bump stocks&only because of this school.
509 2018-02-21 22:09:19 You ok mate
510 2018-02-21 22:09:13 1 - ban bump stocks - big deal, most shooters can shoot almost as fast and more accurately without than with one.
1 - silencers - no such thing - suppressors lower sound about 30 db on average (140 to 110) about 1% since its a log scale
511 2018-02-21 22:09:01 No one except one young man speak about banning the sale of AR 15’s and bump stocks! Were they coached?
512 2018-02-21 22:08:47 Trump's proposition to ban bump stocks will only induce people to buy them. I imagine this is part of the plan. Zap the normiecon amygdala, mobilize normiecon army.
513 2018-02-21 22:08:47 If anything, it’ll be bump stocks, but even for that the freedom caucus will try to add poison pills.
514 2018-02-21 22:08:39 lock the doors arm the teachers  ban bump stocks 60 round clips
515 2018-02-21 22:08:31 But yet it was the Obama administration approved bump fire stocks in the first place???
a 17 year old can enlist in military service and possibly die in combat???
Just something to think about.
516 2018-02-21 22:08:20 And there's gonna be a bill that has some modest gun regulation (banning bump stocks) twinned with something insane, like purchasing a tank for every school.
517 2018-02-21 22:07:59 You’re half right, it started w/their movement but now being hijacked by unscrupulous people with lots of . This President is already doing more than other Presidents. He’s meeting with victims & first responders, he’s banning bump stocks, raising gun ownership age, etc etc.
518 2018-02-21 22:07:45 It won’t do any good. Trump looked totally bored as he had to be quiet and just listen. The best they’ll get is a law against bump stocks which weren’t even used in this most recent massacre.
519 2018-02-21 22:07:41 Republicans are so depraved it will be a cold day in hell when they ban bump stocks. It will never happen as long as Republicans hold the majority.
520 2018-02-21 22:07:07 I've yet to hear a cogent argument on why semi-automatics, silencers, bump stocks are necessary and why a longer mandatory waiting period, mental health status check and gun registration are not.
521 2018-02-21 22:06:50 I'm not splitting hairs between M4s and AR15s. You know bump stocks and extended magazines are relatively easy mods, and they up the rate of fire way past a pump or bolt action. They also can be accurate at 300 yards; stop playing dumb
522 2018-02-21 22:06:28 Refs can only make discions within the established rules of the game, and as the ATF has already stated before they cant define bump stocks as "machine guns" or any other restricted item without more legislation from congress. and state legislation isnt federal legislation
523 2018-02-21 22:06:22 Bump stocks?
524 2018-02-21 22:05:44 Ramp angle is awful for one so rolling stocks a nightmare. Philosophy wise, US has standardized 463L palletized system for fast up/downloads. Russian designed theirs to load directly onto trucks from a/c, thus internal crain. Much less efficient/time consuming. AN124 same issues.
525 2018-02-21 22:05:41 yo @jack do you have a feature to do twitter music? just popular songs on twitter to played streaming from somewhere. Think about it and give me some stocks/share in music revenue for giving the idea.
526 2018-02-21 22:05:33 VIX above 20, and generally uptrending is not good for stocks... Another ramp early March?
527 2018-02-21 22:05:30 Ban on "pump stocks"?? That's not enough!! Put MORE $$ funding towards "Mental Health"!! Where were THOSE AGENCIES??? Dept.OfChild.N.Families!!! Restructure Your Program!!! Congress: Provide More Funding!!!
528 2018-02-21 22:05:28 "We're gonna get it done". Whatever "it" is. Try ban assault ricles, bump stocks, serious background checks, 4 week wait, license all weapons. IT is nothing but a pronoun without a subject.
529 2018-02-21 22:05:15 Dude, really? Have you not had enough!  I'm a gun owner. I live in rural AZ on a farm where guns are a needed tool for protection against predators. You know what's not needed?  High capacity mags and bump stocks!  We need common sense gun control period!
530 2018-02-21 22:05:03 He can't do anything while taking millions from the NRA.  He's just playing president right now.  I guess one of his Mar-a-Lago guests must have told him "hey, at least sign a memo about bump stocks".
531 2018-02-21 22:05:02 I think I'm misunderstanding you. What is he doing that you call a success?

And I ask, how is this fighting back? Against what? Why did he even write this? I don't care who is to blame for bump stocks & assault rifles being here. I want to know what he is going to do about it.
532 2018-02-21 22:04:40 @realDonaldTrump OK so you start with bump stocks. What’s next? Conservatives really are getting tired of being bullied by the progressive left radicals. Please fight for us, Don let them continue to push their socialist narrative on you #MAGA. Never forget!

536 2018-02-21 22:03:44 Back at ya. The part that’s true is the assertion that sacrificing bump stocks doesn’t address the real problem. You admitted as much in your 1st reply when you mentioned AR15s. 
Now, since you’ve so much free time, where’s your plan for budget cuts and long-term fiscal reform?
537 2018-02-21 22:03:31 I'm afraid he was lying about bump stocks leading up to the meeting to calm parents. Media better be all over that if it's a lie & he tries to blame the Democrats. It's noteworthy he's doing a listening session, but there must be action. He doesn't seem to be absorbing much.
538 2018-02-21 22:03:18 Question: Did you know that your urge to put a ban on bump stocks and other devices is a decision that can be respected?

Question: Do you see it is possible to like decisions from someone you loathe?

Not guns

sense of entitlement

Removing safety measures to ensure the psychiatric unwell can’t stockpile guns.

You’ve stopped the next school shooting.

That surely will have a higher deductable then any plans have now
Trust me people just going by
559 2018-02-21 22:00:13 Ummmm No!  Some gun control just makes sense like these Bump Stocks and a National Background Check.

561 2018-02-21 22:00:05 You have the right to your opinion! I think he does, already after eliminate bump stocks! What did Obama do other than create separation and hate between us! My guess both sides will finally get off their collective asses!
562 2018-02-21 21:59:55 President Trump should pursue the ban on Bump Stocks - There is absolutely no need for what is an essential assault weapon for 'protection'!
563 2018-02-21 21:59:50 Prediction; At the end of this, Trump will guarantee 100% that he will do something about background checks, assault weapons and bump stocks.  Minute he steps out of that room he will be descended upon by a group dark men.  He will do nothing.
564 2018-02-21 21:59:49 Yet we don't have bump stocks now. And yes its more than modern sporting rifles, like following up on tips and what not.
565 2018-02-21 21:59:39 During your whole speak on bump stocks and background checks, your tone was basically "I could care less".  It was as though you were being forced to make a speech you didn't want to do and you could care less about school shootings or gun laws.  You're just disgusting!!
566 2018-02-21 21:59:33 Wow I didn’t realise it was that bad 
567 2018-02-21 21:59:31 How might that be relevant to the point I made? Or do you highlight the fact that the Dutch fish mostly herring in UK waters, but there isn't a British market for it?

UK stocks had been overfished prior to joining the EEC and most of the catch is sold to the EU. True or not?
568 2018-02-21 21:59:29 Please stop with these false statements honky. You’re spreading misinformation. There are literally 100’s of links for conversion kits. And tRUmp has only told the DOJ to craft a ban on bump stocks. Long way to go before it happens.
569 2018-02-21 21:59:16 I’m not saying that there isn’t changes that need to be made, I think we need some, bump stocks are fuckin useless, mental health tests administered by RESPONSIBLE gun shop owners, NOT the government, the minute we let them dictate us is the minute we surrender
570 2018-02-21 21:59:12 Is not that they have the urge to cash out millions and gazillions of owned stocks in a day. They are in for the long term.
571 2018-02-21 21:59:12 #ParklandStudentsSpeak #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives #GunReformNow 
Please do advocate for banning assault weapons & bump stocks now.
Gun owners will still be free to own guns, just not ones that fire hundreds of rounds a minute.
572 2018-02-21 21:58:56 my mom literally stocks up on this stuff its crazy i tease her alot and ask her if she is getting ready for the apocalipse 
573 2018-02-21 21:58:51 Here's some "denial":

Obama approved bump stocks.

Obama had 100% control of the federal government, yet did none of the things he complained about.

Both of those suggest that your movement is empty, self-serving politics.
574 2018-02-21 21:58:33 Calling the WH. Hello, can we hear from the president who has taken credit of stocks until several weeks ago?  Hello?  Hello?
575 2018-02-21 21:57:57 Not really coz rates and fx stopped moving and many non-US indices barely moved. US stocks are on the brink of a nice abyss now.

579 2018-02-21 21:56:19 homeboy, the weapons I am referring to fire faster than even an m16 A2 with the three round burst.  I’m talking about bump stocks and other modified assault rifles.  It is you being disingenuous by suggesting the weapons used in ....
580 2018-02-21 21:56:16 Price of bump stocks are about to fly through the roof. SHEESSSHHH
581 2018-02-21 21:55:56 All I read is everyone trying to call the bottom in bonds.  Stocks dip so bonds MUST rally.  NO!  Bonds are smelling both inflation and the Fed's tolerance of same.  Still ridiculously priced in  real terms -- all long bonds.
582 2018-02-21 21:55:37 Like the Dems did for the last 8 years? Who authorized bump stocks? How soon you libs forget.
583 2018-02-21 21:55:30 Don't think I'm the right person for this. Plus, 'coarse' is not a biological definition. But yes, most British Isles cyprinids have been shuffled in waves from the continent. Almost impossible to seek "local" stocks 1/2
584 2018-02-21 21:54:55 I'm a gun owner but we really need stricter background checks and the bump stocks need to be outlawed. There is no reason for a civilian to need that ever
585 2018-02-21 21:54:49 Yeah i was glad he actually made a motion about bump stocks and stuff. I was like finally after a year i can agree with something lol
586 2018-02-21 21:54:32 Better: Age 25 for all semi-automatics, 21 for single shot (fully auto remain illegal). No bump stocks. All buyers must have background check, psych evaluation, written exam, gun range exam, show proof of safe storage in home. Only licensed dealers can sell. No gun show loophole.
587 2018-02-21 21:54:26 Oh wow. That was lucky. Great to hear that it's selling out. Hope they get more stocks in soon. Hope you enjoy it Paul. Please let me know what you think and be sure to show it off.

589 2018-02-21 21:53:57 Bump stocks will be banned bit will return with a different name.
590 2018-02-21 21:53:54 Hasnt he already signed the ban on bump stocks? And encouraged congress to find more solutions?
591 2018-02-21 21:53:26 Yet we have modifications like bump stocks that allow semi automatic guns to act like fully automatic guns. Or how about how kids as young as 13 can go to a gun show and buy a gun with no ID or parent present?  It's more than just assault riffles.
592 2018-02-21 21:53:13 I removed it from my home screen and put it in an app folder I never look at between the stocks and compass
593 2018-02-21 21:53:08 Trump listening to the victims speak, and his proposed ban on bump stocks is actually very good and more than Obama ever did for gun control.
594 2018-02-21 21:53:04 I can hear the Snapchat stocks tumbling at first site of this Tweet...
595 2018-02-21 21:52:19 Just watch trump conn those kids and there families by telling them his looking into bump stocks and other things and having a meeting with governors.all smoke and mirrors.nothing important will happen it about time letting people com down hope it burns it self out.the conn.vot
596 2018-02-21 21:52:16 Yes the NRA  is preventing sensible regulations. The NRA opposes universal background checks, Assault weapon bans, not even bump stocks. Why is gun ownership and use not regulated like vehicles? THE NRA
597 2018-02-21 21:52:14 ....and like @SRuhle said the NRA will go along with the bump stocks, so he is doing nothing to challenge them.
598 2018-02-21 21:51:47 two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
The decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks.  
I understand that this wasn’t per Obama usual policy’s on gun control.
599 2018-02-21 21:51:26 Hoping so much that we get better gun laws and enforcement. But, even with all the current activism, it's likely that NOTHING WILL BE DONE. Conservatives will, at best, say something will change, like maybe bump stocks. 1/2 #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunControl #MarchForOurLives
600 2018-02-21 21:51:06 .Yeah.
Bump stocks now.
Probly grandfather existing ones in.
After they most likely sold 100K of them since the LV massacre.
Big whoop.
601 2018-02-21 21:50:48 Is that 27% including retirement plans? If it is then virtually ALL stocks are owned by....say the top 10%.
602 2018-02-21 21:50:43 I bet Penny stocks will be next !
603 2018-02-21 21:50:40 Crypto and stocks have no reason to correlate at some point they decouple and never trend together again.
604 2018-02-21 21:50:28 We have a duty to all those affected by all the horrendous shootings to fight like hell for change. Ban bump stocks, assault weapons, and anything that should only be used by military or law enforcement. If you want to use those weapons, join the military or police. PERIOD.
605 2018-02-21 21:50:23 You do realize he pushed sessions to figure out how to ban bump stocks back in October with 0 publicity.  And this just happens, give him rime to get something on his desk to sign. He's not a dictator
606 2018-02-21 21:50:18 Thank you for responding back !!!! They are in the right space with Instagram and whatsapp is not yet monetized..So I do see it as my long term holding but given the environment these days... getting skeptical !! But , your response always give me a right direction !!! Thank you
607 2018-02-21 21:49:55 Y'all saw how quickly the GOP jumped to get a tax scam bill passed. 

Now watch them drag their feet and do nothing over gun violence and strengthening background checks, banning bump stocks, or reimposing the assault weapons ban.

Priorities.
608 2018-02-21 21:49:54 Thank you for the input. We have forwarded it on as feedback on your behalf. ^DT
609 2018-02-21 21:49:47 I think the Wii's casual audience was huge, and dissipated quickly, the Switch has a higher percent of hardcore audience, so you're right, it won't dissipate as drastically. 
But expect Nintendo stocks to be noticeably lower in 3-4 years. With console releases, it's like the tide
610 2018-02-21 21:49:44 Turned it off shortly after the misguided girl that called Drumpf a “great leader” and praised his pathetically weak move of sending a “memo” about bump-stocks. Just like his rallies the people are carefully screened #Trumplies #NeverAgainMSD
611 2018-02-21 21:49:01 let’s invest in these stocks, let’s vacate on these yachts
612 2018-02-21 21:49:00 We should continue “fighting our fight,” but we can’t ignore Trump.
He has too much power and he’s the ‘NRA’s president.’
They spent over $30 million to help elect him, therefore he’ll do what’s good for them, not for the people.
Don’t be fooled by the bum stocks ‘ban.’
613 2018-02-21 21:48:57 I agree....the guy that slaughtered 50 plus people with AR 15s and bump stocks was over 50. Ban both.....period.
614 2018-02-21 21:48:42 The MS analyst also mentioned higher inflation.  If nominal rates are rising mostly from higher inflation & not from higher real rates, then growth outlook is unch. The same level of corp earnings is discounted by higher nominal rates = lower NPV for stocks.  (Part 2)
615 2018-02-21 21:48:38 Stocks mixed in volatile day: US -.6%; Europe +.2%. Small investors be wary of trying to time market & buy when market looks like it’s rallying like today. Likely to lead to short-term paper loss or worse, panic selling & realized loss.
616 2018-02-21 21:48:29 While I am supporting both of those changes (bump stocks and minimum age), I agree with you about gradual erosion of freedom.
617 2018-02-21 21:48:25 MG this is a Trump shit apprentice shit show.  He is using these people as puppets he is owned by NRA and will do nothing big.  He will throw some money at Mental Health which he & Repubs slashed, say we will do better at Background checks & maybe ban bump stocks.  Wake up.
618 2018-02-21 21:47:55 Just as I suspected. EVERY person there is a sycophant for Trump. So far, I've heard "more active shooter drills", "outlaw bump stocks", "higher gun buying age", "mental health", "more school security". NOTHING about outlawing military rifles or large magazines.
619 2018-02-21 21:47:53 It is a natural cycle. Understand this way..If buyers are legit then 1st phase of stocks buying done..Then it requires pullback as stock bounces too much... Whatever that level will be, that will be the second phase of buying assuming buyers are legit from 1st phase else problem.
620 2018-02-21 21:47:42 Just so everyone sees this. Stocks tank 2000 points...Gartman gets bearish...stocks  immediately go back up...Gartman supposedly covered short...stocks then go back down.  It really is incredible. It happens all the time! Has to be doing this on purpose or is truly clueless.
621 2018-02-21 21:47:17 Bring back the stocks on a Saturday morning better than telly anyday.
622 2018-02-21 21:46:48 I can see the lockdown drills happening and maybe police officers assigned to schools but I dont think they'll go anywhere near bump stocks.
623 2018-02-21 21:46:48 Bump Stocks.
624 2018-02-21 21:46:44 Stocks initially jumped higher Wednesday, Feb. 21, after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month, but then declined sharply. The minutes indicate that the Fed sees further rate hikes ahead amid strong economic growth and a rise in inflation.
625 2018-02-21 21:46:39 Ban bump stocks or any devices that enhance weapons into semi auto or auto.
626 2018-02-21 21:46:24 That's a good goal and would turn immense profit, but greatly difficult. The Wii's beginning was already a perfect storm, I just don't think it's realistic to expect that storm to stay perfect.
The Switch is looking fantastic, but expect the stocks follow the same pattern
627 2018-02-21 21:46:21 Dear Donald Trump:  Your big deal was some kind of memo on bump stocks.  Why wasn't that already done?  Pathetic!  Signed: America #DeadlineWH
628 2018-02-21 21:46:13 If people can tell by looking at you whether you are having a good or a bad day in the markets, YOUR POSITIONS ARE TO BIG!

629 2018-02-21 21:46:01 @NCHouseSpeaker Ban Bump Stocks
A ban on bump stocks of the kind used in Las Vegas to mimic automatic weapon fire. #NOGUNSinschools
630 2018-02-21 21:45:38 I tend to cater my grocery shopping to the stores that have the best book deals and stocks
631 2018-02-21 21:45:11 Retest first then continue the uptrend in stocks??
632 2018-02-21 21:44:59 I have a different problem: I cannot keep anything in the fridge or the cupboard. My wife stocks them, but I throw it all out, preferring the clean, pristine refrigerator walls and warm pantry shelving. .. We eat out a lot, but she wants to put locks on the fridge & pantry doors.
633 2018-02-21 21:44:59 People can change but the facts do not, Australia bans all guns, homicides go up, I’m not against all gun laws, ban bump stocks and make the rifle age 21, but take the guns completley away and history will repeat itself
634 2018-02-21 21:44:47 Those other items actually convert the gun to fully-automatic.

And yes, that makes a rather large difference. Not just legally, but practically as well.

I don’t care about bump stocks, but they’d better not mess up our other, established laws in the process.
635 2018-02-21 21:44:37 I am a teacher, you are right. Automatic weapons , bump stocks, ghosts guns should be banned. ( They were under Brady Bill which was not renewed in 04.) If you viewed video of FL shooting, a hand gun would not have helped. MR 15 blows through doors.
636 2018-02-21 21:44:31 is it cause and effect? @GeraldoRivera has dinner w/ @realDonaldTrump over the weekend at Mara-A-Lago and the President then issues his first actions about guns - calling for more background checks and ordering regulation for the end bump stocks that turn rifles into machine guns
637 2018-02-21 21:44:23 This is what antis do.They just keep trying to chip away at gun rights one step at a time..Trump banned Bump stocks..Ok..Now he's THINKING about getting the age raised from 18-21 to buy a rifle.If and i say if he does,then i'm beginning to wonder,what's next?
638 2018-02-21 21:44:02 Trigger to a "shock drop" for stocks you think? Maybe retest the lows? That is the call by @dwyerstrategy on @HalftimeReport this afternoon.
639 2018-02-21 21:43:41 I do not have positions in the mentioned stocks.  I have just noticed such scandalous ways while researching and looking at stocks for a few years now.
640 2018-02-21 21:43:39 NRA -your fees are too high -your administrators are paid too much. But your message is clear and you are Freedoms Safest Place.  Will be re-upping my membership. I don’t need your freebie incentives to join -I just need my 2A protected at all costs.Oh yeah and fuck bump stocks.
641 2018-02-21 21:43:36 so the bump stocks will stop perpetrators from taking the lives of innocent souls?
642 2018-02-21 21:43:27 Better Background Checks-sure
Outlawing "Bump Stocks" go ahead will make NO Difference
Bump Stocks R Easily made. Murderers DO NOT CARE about LAWS Get REAL
Left will legislate us to only have Water Pistols
#msnbc #FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @NRA #NRA #Parkland #Dems #TheResistance
643 2018-02-21 21:43:24 Bump Stocks verbieten ist vollkommener Bullshit und nur Augenwischerei.
644 2018-02-21 21:43:09 The fact that people have to plead for tiny restrictions like not selling assault rifles, not selling bump stocks, not selling guns to people who have harmed others or themselves...
645 2018-02-21 21:43:01 So when the industry was booming, stocks were soaring and profits were crazy but as the popularity in traditional sneakers has fallen over the years to product they do not carry, they have struggled to keep their stocks above trends that run at about 55% of where they expected
646 2018-02-21 21:42:34 If you think the GOP & NRA are actually going to give up the bump stocks, then you probably were a Trump voter & you ARE GETTING CONNED AGAIN.  Everything you are hearing is what the GOP & NRA thinks you & the press want to hear. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN!!!
647 2018-02-21 21:42:08 I Mate, DM me i have a list of CAD exposed Weed stocks ......
648 2018-02-21 21:42:06 It’s obvious his 20% showed up. Only the one man so far was brave enough to mention bump stocks/assault rifles.
649 2018-02-21 21:42:05 They talk about fundamentals in the slandered stock, but what about stocks that are in the negative like Tesla?  Nobody wants to talk about fundamentals, but claim the price is in future potential.  Does ROKU or AMD not have positive future potential?
650 2018-02-21 21:41:57 Remember $ADXS Advaxis? that was a fun one from the #Biotech2015 bubble, now in desperation mode trying to sell stocks in a secondary at $2... Thanks for playing.
651 2018-02-21 21:41:44 Bans of automatic weapons resulted in them no longer being used for mass shootings. We should continue this, and add bump stocks, semi-automatic weapons, and high capacity magazines to the list. Hunters don't need them. 

2/x
652 2018-02-21 21:41:43 Investors in South Africa hit the trifecta on Wednesday, as the nation's stocks, bonds and currencies all gained as the nation's new president announced plans to raise sales taxes and curb spending to stabilize debt and prevent another credit rating downgrade.
653 2018-02-21 21:41:29 He won’t even try to. He will ban bump stocks because it’s obvious and the optics are good and then do nothing else.
654 2018-02-21 21:41:27 BK have full stocks of chips , burgers, salad, drinks , napkins, cups, sauce sachets, buns, cheese slices and everything on their menus..... and that my friends is down to one thing... the storage and deliveries are carried out by the mighty BIDVEST. #enjoyourclosures
655 2018-02-21 21:41:13 What are bump stocks exactly?? 
656 2018-02-21 21:40:55 Even professionals are not trading this crypto market, so why would amateurs try? This is the most highly manipulated market to top it off. Crypto currency is an investment. You want to trade stick to Forex, Futures, stocks, options etc. Crypto market will wipe you out.
657 2018-02-21 21:40:43 So Nintendo made a lot of money with the Wii but investors didn’t like what they were doing and that made their stocks go down? Am I understanding this right?
658 2018-02-21 21:40:36 You absolute cutie 
659 2018-02-21 21:40:29 You should understand that many stocks are manipulated.  AMD was slandered into plunging territory despite a beat.  I'm sure people with big money aided in the slander because a few percent of millions of dollars is a lot of money.
660 2018-02-21 21:40:25 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
661 2018-02-21 21:40:02 The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place. forex stocks
662 2018-02-21 21:39:07 Jfc I watched one video on bump stocks and now my entire @YouTube recommendations are nothing but conservative videos. Your algorithm blows.
663 2018-02-21 21:39:02 No it cant...it can be modified yes...but civilians cant get the parts to convert it legally...plus Trump just banned bump stocks...so for a law abiding citizen...it cant be made full auto
664 2018-02-21 21:38:56 Stocks Turn Lower, Dollar Rises After Fed Minutes /articles/2018-02-20/asia-stocks-to-drop-dollar-gains-as-yields-rise-markets-wrap
665 2018-02-21 21:38:39 I love you Chuck but we really must ban all assault rifles too, as prior administrations have done, together with those bump stocks. Both are only meant for mass murder & war. Also institute buy back for millions already out there. AND require license & way stricter backgd check
666 2018-02-21 21:38:37 Don't be placated with Trump's order to ban bump stocks for semiautomatic weapons. We need mil style assault weapons out if the public sphere.

667 2018-02-21 21:38:02 Probably 20 million. If you draw a trendline off the 04, 08, 14, stocks that's where it intersects--can u say BULL
668 2018-02-21 21:37:49 Is anyone watching the President live on tv???  WHAT IS HAPPENING???? It's like he has handpicked who's there.  It's not THANK YOU!!!??!! Do something like NOT sponser NRA, ban AR 15 guns except military, waste bump stocks....get a new phone resident....
669 2018-02-21 21:37:39 What are bump stocks ?
Is that the ammunition ?
670 2018-02-21 21:37:30 He took credit for not action on bump stocks
671 2018-02-21 21:37:25 The manipulation occurring in the #Cobalt space is obvious. Mineral price going up but stocks down? Cobalt supply agreements for $AAPL et. al should change the sentiment. It’s sad to see retail get screwed however little can be done; simply the big boys playing with their algo’s
672 2018-02-21 21:37:23 You're right except that the NRA is literally promoting death and preventing us from being able to stop them by writing laws such as forcing concealed carry across state lines, allowing bump stocks and  silencers that are realistically only used to commit murder.
673 2018-02-21 21:37:03 With an assault weapon and bump stocks.

675 2018-02-21 21:36:51 I wonder how much of this commitment towards stocks stems from the fed put and how much from plain stupidity
676 2018-02-21 21:36:45 I can’t stand the thought of trading stocks anymore. Futures seem to obey levels way better. Just have to be very patient that’s it. Super easy to rush and get burned
677 2018-02-21 21:36:42 Which explains why he is listening to High School kids and attempting an effort on bump stocks.
678 2018-02-21 21:36:36 Hear a lot about how too many creatures are taken from the sea, stocks are crashing & some face extinction.
Imagine they were all there. How deep would the water be?
Stripping all life from the sea may be our best defence against rising sea levels caused by global warming.
679 2018-02-21 21:36:35 So the kids want more drills and "to feel safe"?  Oh and age restrictions and no bump stocks. Really?  #ParklandStudentsSpeak
680 2018-02-21 21:36:35 Trump is using these kids for a photo op and I guarantee he will not do anything. A memo does not change the law. @realDonaldTrump is a bought and paid NRA puppet as well as GOP Congress. Why didn't Trump ban bump stocks after Vegas shooting? #NeverAgain #GunReformNow
681 2018-02-21 21:36:19 Yet you support banning things like bump stocks. It seems you do not understand how government works. A bump stuck ban will progress into a full blown ban on semi-automatic weapons. Wise up.
682 2018-02-21 21:36:16 If ppl can't see its the Entire market that's garbage right now they are blind, all these stocks move as a whole. FAT, MMJ, PKG, DDB, MYM, NF, N, TBP, BLO, THC,  LGC.... The list could go on forever, the bashers are out on every stock in full force, eventually things will turn!
683 2018-02-21 21:36:15 Donald #Trump ha annunciato di aver chiesto al Dipartimento di Giustizia americano la messa al bando dei bump stocks, meccanismi che modificano le armi semi-automatiche in mitragliatrici automatiche.
684 2018-02-21 21:36:07 Rising interest rates continue to act as a wet blanket for stocks. As soon as the 10 year treasury yield spiked up this afternoon, equities quickly sold off the highs and ended the day in the red. Stock market volatility is back as investors deal with a complex monetary backdrop.
685 2018-02-21 21:35:54 Change age to 21 and go to better back ground checks buy,get rid of hi capacity mags and bump stocks. USMC vet 68-69 Father and Grand and Great Grand Father. 
686 2018-02-21 21:35:48 One reason you’re being a disingenuous prick is that those shotguns had bump stocks, one other thing that we actually want banned.
687 2018-02-21 21:35:30 How we're these people chosen,? They're all telling Trump what a great leader he is. No mention so far of any gun bans, no mention of raising the age to purchase. Just thanking everyone, talking about bump stocks and school safety drills.
688 2018-02-21 21:35:23 Except he HASN'T actually taken action on bump stocks. But okay.
689 2018-02-21 21:35:18 Watching the students address Trump re: guns/schools. So far none have asked for gun control. Heard "ban gun stocks", "Trump is doing a great job". CLEARLY, these kids and their messages have been screened. #BanAssaultWeapons
690 2018-02-21 21:34:48 Lovely pix.. but those cormorants eats quite literally tons of salmon, depleting stocks no end.. hate to be a party pooper but that is how it is!!
691 2018-02-21 21:34:46 The NRA agreed that bump stocks should be banned months ago. @SkyNews
692 2018-02-21 21:34:44 So far 5 kids from parkland spoke & 1 mom. He started off this photo op saying they already are looking into background checks & stopping bump stocks. I think the WH was very selective in which student/ parents they invited cause they sound completely different from the majority
693 2018-02-21 21:34:34 He better DO more than listen!  And banning bump stocks only begins to address the Las Vegas shooting incident.  We need help for our kids.  Imagine if this were Barron’s school!
694 2018-02-21 21:34:33 No problem with that. What he's saying now about bump stocks and school safety have been pre-approved by the NRA.
695 2018-02-21 21:34:33 I know it’s a trading platform, what I’m saying is, is the only purpose of the platform is to make money? If so then it literally has no use case. Stocks are companies, cryptos are currencies, football index is people?
696 2018-02-21 21:34:27 & fed minutes spoil the rally looking to jump on some $TVIX or short indices tomo  #markets #stocks #equities
697 2018-02-21 21:34:02 To be clear. You agreed,  then twist my words. I'm not out here fighting to keep bump stocks. I'm fighting for All my rights. Even when I seem to have none left. Still they want more. I say, he banned bump stocks. You say impeach.

701 2018-02-21 21:33:35 It's one thing to restore honor and morality to the US as in theory MAGA would be but it's evident that subverting the rule of law is still a thing as Turmp by executive order is banning bump stocks, the appropriate method is constitutional amendment.
702 2018-02-21 21:33:32 I don’t know how this is possible but it’s going to get worse their stocks just went down
703 2018-02-21 21:33:24 Rising interest rates continue to act as a wet blanket for stocks. As soon as the 10 year treasury yield spiked up this afternoon, equities quickly sold off the highs and ended the day in the red. Stock market volatility is back as investors deal with a complex monetary backdrop.
704 2018-02-21 21:32:57 The sharp reversal into the close helps illustrate the type of volatility which tends to occur around the 50 day MA.    Buying stocks as close to a buy point as possible helps to keep risk in check as major averages continue to dance around the 50 day MA
705 2018-02-21 21:32:29 Teenagers talking about bump stocks is insane #NeverAgain @realDonaldTrump America we are better than this.  #BumpStockBan #AssaultWeaponsBan
706 2018-02-21 21:32:25 In my opinion, trump went to the nra and said you got to give me something for a "win" and the NRA came back with regulations on bump stocks that are made by a third party and not by the gun manufacturers they work for.
707 2018-02-21 21:32:24 Yes, houses shouldnt be flipped like penny stocks, by foreigners or Canadians. They are shelter, to live in. #vanre
708 2018-02-21 21:32:10 So far two #ParklandStudents have spoken to @realDonaldTrump. Neither of them said he isn't going for enough on gun control. One student: "I’m confident you’ll do the right thing. Appreciate you looking at the bump stocks yesterday."
709 2018-02-21 21:32:09 Options/Stock/Crypto tip of the day:
Shorts on all oversold stocks, and load up on Crypto drop as pull outs will happen.
710 2018-02-21 21:32:02 Agreed! The market is so volatile it can change in a second and the TA needs to be monitored more than stocks to increase positions or take profits.
711 2018-02-21 21:31:37 These Students were COACHED ... making SURE they thanked 45 for "all he has done" WHAT HAS HE DONE? BUMP STOCKS?
712 2018-02-21 21:31:31 Then 12 to 2 I played halo while watching the stocks. Then cleaned, prepped one or two more games with Revan now I'm at work
713 2018-02-21 21:31:26 What's to continue talking about????Just do what needs to be done. Ban AR-15 weapons and bump stocks!!  Simple as that but NRA won't let the useless GOP and trump do that.
714 2018-02-21 21:31:16 Don't let it stop at bump stocks...that's just a pacifier to get them through the week.  Keep making history!! #neveragain
715 2018-02-21 21:31:11 "I appreciate you looking at bump stocks.. it's a step in the right direction.. maybe we can compromise on some solutions so no child, no person ever in this world will have to go something so horrific and tragic," Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS student Julia Cordover says at the WH
716 2018-02-21 21:31:07 people hold stocks for 3 years to get 50% lmao
717 2018-02-21 21:30:42 First student to speak at #POTUSlisteningsession commends @realDonaldTrump for inviting them to speak and for his movement to ban bump stocks @cbs2iowa @fox28Iowa
718 2018-02-21 21:30:36 Confident Trump will do the right thing? He had months to take care of bump stocks, yet now when the SHTF, he asks Sessions to look into it!  Where did they get these people from? TrumpSupportersRUs? Trump probably had them screened for party registration.
719 2018-02-21 21:30:32 The listening & the maybe , might do something on bump stocks is Trump doing the least possible while trying to get media to say he’s doing something. This will take relentless pressure

721 2018-02-21 21:30:22 Do you think rappers buy stocks in the pharmaceutical industry so they can still say they move weight?
722 2018-02-21 21:30:20 There’s no one solution. I agree with that. There never is. Bump stocks bans wouldn’t have prevented Parkland, and age restrictions wouldn’t have stopped Vegas. That’s why we do a concert of multiple measures. Same as ANY other issue we’ve ever addressed.
723 2018-02-21 21:30:17 Guns don’t kill people. People kill. We need a ban on bump stocks except for military and law enforcement. Those purchasing should be 21 and have through background check.
724 2018-02-21 21:30:13 #theblazewhy with the debate over the 2A and school shootings, why is it that security of the schools is not a major talking point. Regardless of what we discuss/compromise on (bump stocks, as you talked about today), I know many schools anyone can walk into w/ no resistance
725 2018-02-21 21:30:08 Did u criticize obama when he approved the sales of bump stocks?

728 2018-02-21 21:30:01 Students from Stoneman Douglas thank the President for hosting them and his actions on bump stocks #StonemanShooting
729 2018-02-21 21:29:55 The Romney thing is lame. Bump stocks are lame. The Deep State is vast and powerful. Romney will lose, bump stocks shouldn’t exist and the Deep State will be diminished. Have faith
730 2018-02-21 21:29:39 And we know it! And Democrats are too partisan to oppose it! Just wait till they have no voice too! Bump stocks are the leap off to the slippery slope!! #SerfdomHereWeCome
731 2018-02-21 21:29:36 The top five stocks that fell today were $DCN,  $NFX. $CPB,  $CHK, AMD $GRMN.
732 2018-02-21 21:29:32 Trump coming out against Bump Stocks is like Apple coming out against Ransom Ware. It’s not exactly a bold move.
733 2018-02-21 21:29:21 Julia Cordover, #Parkland survivor: "I appreciate you looking at bump stocks. Maybe compromise on some solutions so that no child, no person has to go through this."
734 2018-02-21 21:29:08 - @julia_cordover says that banning bump stocks was a good start, but wants to work with Trump for more compromise
735 2018-02-21 21:29:05 Looks like their stocks are about to “take off”
736 2018-02-21 21:28:54 Well I mean assault rifles won't that's just silly but bump stocks probably will so yeah
737 2018-02-21 21:28:52 Twitter stocks last year were $15 per share, they’re averaging $33 now.. my theory is that Donald J Trumps tweets are the biggest contributor to that increase. I guarantee only 30% of baby boomers even knew what Twitter was before he started running. #MAGA 
738 2018-02-21 21:28:52 Like I said , things that work. Banning bump stocks or “ assault rifles “  do very little to stop gun violence. Only thing it will do is let politicians run campaign ads claiming they “ did something “
739 2018-02-21 21:28:40 I see yields are mean, in red stocks’re too 
 I see them blow up for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world 
740 2018-02-21 21:28:36 they must be stupid..They should buy US stocks instead..
741 2018-02-21 21:28:24 The top five stocks that gained today were $AAP, $MAT, $EXPD. $MOS. and $PSA.
742 2018-02-21 21:28:07 U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday in a rocky session after the  release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting  pushed yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a  four-year high.
743 2018-02-21 21:28:07 Mark the time - I agree with you! AND we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban, ban hi-capacity magazines, lift ban on CDC research, scuttle concealed-carry reciprocity bill, ban bump stocks and require a national computerized registry... to start. #GunControlNow
744 2018-02-21 21:28:05 A worse case of yes we really want to hear you, but don’t fool yourself into thinking that we give a shit. We haven’t listened to any of the others yet, what do you think makes this different. Gun laws and regulation of bump stocks and modification of guns would be great.
745 2018-02-21 21:27:59 I know right! funny thing is, this is how a certain popular world wide footwear operates and their stocks are in the shitter now
746 2018-02-21 21:27:40 For example: the DOJ isn’t sure if it has the ability to ban bump stocks specifically because they don’t actually turn semi autos into automatic weapons (which would be banned under the 1986 law).
747 2018-02-21 21:27:20 Rising interest rates continue to act as a wet blanket for stocks. As soon as the 10 year treasury yield spiked up this afternoon, equities quickly sold off the highs and ended the day in the red. Stock market volatility is back as investors deal with a complex monetary backdrop.
748 2018-02-21 21:27:19 These kids are scared and that is understandable.  Ask them would they feel safe if they knew that there was person or persons at school ready to engaged anyone that wants to come to their school and shoot people. That would be an immediate relief.  Banning bump stocks is not.
749 2018-02-21 21:27:13 Please define which gun laws or background checks would have helped in Parkland.  Bump Stocks are of negligible impact. Not putting lives above guns, putting rights above pointless rights infringements. Re: idleness: Agreed, but the changes needed aren't directly gun-law related.
750 2018-02-21 21:26:57 Don’t be fooled students. A machine gun is fully automatic and does not need a bump stock. An AR-15 is an assault rifle that can be altered with a bump stock to become automatic. So if Trump says he will ban bump stocks for machine guns it’s garbage.
751 2018-02-21 21:26:51 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $WMT, $AMD, and $CHK.
752 2018-02-21 21:26:28 President trump should have not signed away stocks for guns it just gives democrats a step closer to take All guns &protections &2nd amend.
753 2018-02-21 21:26:23 Anyone who believes trump will ban gun stocks or do anything..call Kushner. he's got a building to sell you!! 666!!!
754 2018-02-21 21:26:22 Not really, Massachusetts banned them last month and were given days to turn them in under threat of a life in prison as of today 4 bump stocks have been turned in.
755 2018-02-21 21:26:21 Trump is actually pushing to ban bump stocks. An actual thing I agree with.
756 2018-02-21 21:26:03 Hi Nathan, I have been searching the nearest store to you that stocks Horizon Zero dawn complete edition and I was able to find it in the Mickleover store In Derby. 1/2
757 2018-02-21 21:25:51 Don’t be fooled students. A machine gun is fully automatic and does not need a bump stock. An AR-15 is an assault rifle that can be altered with a bump stock to become automatic. So if Trump says he will ban bump stocks for machine guns it’s garbage.

759 2018-02-21 21:24:59 Machine guns are regulated as well by legislation so I agree that it may not be possible to construct an administrative rule that classifies Bump stocks as a machine gun part but it is illegal to put parts in a gun that reverts it to its auto design.
760 2018-02-21 21:24:43 Semi Automatic which mean hand guns and rifles are ok though.  And those cheeky stocks that make 'em shoot quicker getting around those rules.  Cheeky buggers.
761 2018-02-21 21:24:40 I was against bump stocks. 

Apparently Obama thought they'd have a "purpose."

765 2018-02-21 21:24:17 Yes..bump stocks are not needed and should be banned. But without a bump stock..he still kills some. And that is his mental health, not a gun legislation issue
766 2018-02-21 21:22:19 And weren’t bump stocks made legal during Obama’s Administration?

768 2018-02-21 21:22:00 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks will not solve the problem!  Get rid of the AR15 type weapons. Do it because it is good for the country.
769 2018-02-21 21:21:45 Billy Graham was great.
But by you circumventing the 2nd with an exec. Order with the atf on bump stocks , well that's unconstitutional, you lost a tremendous voter base over this,,
However strategic or not this move was, it's a huge mistake.
770 2018-02-21 21:21:37 Apparently Trump has announced support for stronger background checks on gun purchases and banning bump stocks. Additionally, today he's meeting with students and families affected by the shooting last week.

Sincerely hoping this is a step toward real change.

772 2018-02-21 21:20:44 It is a weapon that is used for hunting humans. It is an assault weapon, not a defensive weapon. Bump stocks on such a weapon make it fully automatic. Banning assault weapons worked. Still have weapons suited for defense and hunting.
773 2018-02-21 21:20:35 Sorry for late reply. Unfortunately I don't trade in the penny land or stocks below $10. Yeah I miss out on opportunities but I'm ok with that. Good luck to you.

775 2018-02-21 21:20:16 I've been trading futures, index and commodities only for past two years.  Took a year to learn and test strategies. I barely trade stocks anymore. Do what works for ou. Have to find you're system, then work to become good at it and then exploit it.
776 2018-02-21 21:20:12 Where, in what I said, did I urge that we “ignore” the industry behind bump stocks and other modifications?
777 2018-02-21 21:19:55 How many stocks do you typically hold at a time?
778 2018-02-21 21:19:37 A recent Reuters poll found that US crude stocks likely built by 1.3 million bbl last week, a fourth consecutive week. Motor gasoline stockpiles are projected to have decreased by 0.6 million bbl. Distillates are expected to have decreased by almost 1.6 million bbl.
779 2018-02-21 21:19:07 @sullivanradio If Trump gives into the demands of these students bans assault rifles, bump stocks ups the age to buy rifles, extends background checks and then we have another mass shooting then what happens? Do we try and ban guns outright?
780 2018-02-21 21:19:06 Eating #healthyfood is secondary, not eating #junkfood is primary.

784 2018-02-21 21:18:13 Ah-chooo! Stocks go down. Tied my shoelaces...stocks go up. That’s where we are right now
785 2018-02-21 21:18:11 What would have helped in Vegas? A ban on bump stocks. And what Trump has proposed won’t hold up in court. We need LEGISLATION to fix that.
786 2018-02-21 21:18:07 The Vegas shooter used multiple weapons, AR-15s with a bump stock. That's how he killed or injured over 600 people.

Bump stocks are an accessory. And they don't apply to most mass shootings.

You want to save lives, get rid of guns that kill so fast that no one has a chance.
787 2018-02-21 21:18:00 They’re evil for not banning bump stocks? Do you even know what the hell you’re talking about? Go smoke another bowl and quit trying to sound intelligent.

791 2018-02-21 21:16:53 WOW!  This is a 180 turn-around!  Stocks negative on the day and in risk of having short-selling programs kick in.  But bonds are hardly responsive.  Smells suspicious.  Big selling came into bonds and notes moderately after the FED minutes to suggest a big seller.  Now what?
792 2018-02-21 21:16:36 Lots of money coming out of stocks & bonds. Will it go to real estate, private equity, both or something else? $SPY $TLT
793 2018-02-21 21:16:14 Silencers are regulated by legislation (National Firearms Act of 1934, updated periodically by congress). No legislation on bump stocks yet.
794 2018-02-21 21:16:04 Who, the students? Well, you’d have to ask them, but I’m guessing it’s mostly what most Dems/liberals have been asking for for awhile: Ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, etc.; full background checks; waiting periods; limit on magazine/clip capacities and so forth.
795 2018-02-21 21:16:00 Your right. If he bans bump stocks you can still purchase an AR-15, so what's the point? You have to ban both or it's ineffective. 

Gun owners might be ok with a bump stock ban because they know they can still purchase an assault weapon.
796 2018-02-21 21:15:57 very good point but like we saw in oil collapse, even bankruptcy-driven discipline is an ephemeral mirage.  reality is 10s of billions of capital waiting on sidelines to come into cap structures in front of equity, which may be where we head, so these stocks may have lost decade
797 2018-02-21 21:15:54 Students should unite, with parents, into a National group supporting increased gun regulations. 
Every school is at risk as long as military grade weapons are legal. Banning Bump stocks and silencers are not enough.
798 2018-02-21 21:15:44 @SenFeinstein ban assault rifles and bump stocks now, thanks

800 2018-02-21 21:15:27 They’re using trumps terminology . Trump pushes ban on 'bump stocks' — devices that turn weapons into 'machine guns'
801 2018-02-21 21:15:22 $ROKU Prime example of why it's not a good idea to hold stocks through earnings.
802 2018-02-21 21:15:21 Bump stocks make semi automatic guns shoot automatic, are you suggesting we ban all guns, even pistols?
803 2018-02-21 21:15:20 Didn't know that bump stocks were used to change firearms
804 2018-02-21 21:14:57 My hope for the Listening Session with @realDonaldTrump is that he listens. And responds appropriately by immediately signing an executive order to ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Require vigorous background checks and allocates $ to intervene with the At Risk people.
805 2018-02-21 21:14:52 Why Bump Stocks Ever Existed

1: keep hicks dumping mags and 'having fun' thus staying angry about full auto laws

2: Serve as a sacrificial lamb that doesn't really make anybody any safer unless you happen to spend large amounts of time at the target end of a backwoods gun range
806 2018-02-21 21:14:27 Most of the mass shootings have involved rifles with no bump stocks anyway. The mass shooting of police in Dallas, I think the guy used a 1950's era Soviet semi automatic weapon.
807 2018-02-21 21:14:15 I didn't sell any bitcoin, you didn't get those from me, hodling. You may have got some stocks I sold, but I am still sticking with they are WAY overvalued. They will crash, always do, and interest rates are going to be hiked, so seniors will flee stocks to bond ladders and CDs.

810 2018-02-21 21:13:34 Stocks take another fall as the yield on 10-year treasuries gets uncomfortably close to 3 percent.
811 2018-02-21 21:13:25 It's carefully worded so that if Sessions comes back and says bump stocks don't make a gun a machine guy then he won't try and ban them. It's how to look like you're doing something while doing nothing. Trump's specialty...
812 2018-02-21 21:13:10 Banning bump stocks as your only attempt at gun control is like making the ban of a very specific and rare type of needle the centerpiece of your opioid epidemic plan. As usual, @realDonaldTrump is a remarkably uninformed coward. So much 4 standing up to establishment, you tool.

816 2018-02-21 21:12:32 You should call yourself @MicroScope17. You have some valuable observations but the fact remains that a true macro perspective would acknowledge that #bitcoin is affected by currencies just like most assets. Thus, there is indeed a correlation between stocks and $BTCUSD.

827 2018-02-21 21:10:49 Whether @piersmorgan influenced @realDonaldTrump 's decision when it comes to banning bump stocks is irrelevant. Saying he had no influence is also saying that marches, protests and media platforms have no influence

I support reporting more mental health issues into the NICS system.  I am OK with banning bump stocks as they are a gimmick.

I am unsure if there is any empirical evidence regarding waiting periods reducing crime.

835 2018-02-21 21:09:39 Banning bumps stocks, 
836 2018-02-21 21:09:20 I’m all for strict vetting of gun laws for children and the mentally ill. So let’s ban bump stocks and see what happens. I doubt NRA members or people with a gun license would use these to murder someone but maybe you’re right 
837 2018-02-21 21:09:11 As we sit here and ponder the future of gun reform, we have doubts as to whether or not bump stocks can actually even be banned.  Damn, it was so easy to ban gay marriage  for so long.  A good ? Is why bump stocks were ever legal to begin with?
838 2018-02-21 21:08:42 The typical 60/40 stocks & bonds portfolio didn't perform well today. You should think outside the box and watch @tastytrade to see who did well!
839 2018-02-21 21:08:41 Loizzi he just now wants to ban bump stocks. Didn’t the Vegas shooting happen in October. So he’s making a move on something that should of happen last year and it took another massacre to make that change. Let’s make a change on age limit.

842 2018-02-21 21:08:23 First one is good. Second one is good if it is true. 3rd one I have mixed feelings about. And our soldiers defeated ISIS, not Trump. So far he is continuing the wars both he & Obama claimed to finally end. 

He apparently supports some regulation on bump stocks, so thats good.
843 2018-02-21 21:08:03 Enact common sense gun restrictions, eg universal background checks, ban on military assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. Then add other interventions as we can afford them. "Mental health focus" means doing nothing. "Armed security guards" -- who's going to pay for that?

847 2018-02-21 21:07:38 @realDonaldTrump gets 0 points for this executive order to review regulating bump stocks. #NotImpressed
848 2018-02-21 21:07:08 Bump stocks turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons.   It's a start.  AUTOMATIC weapons are already HIGHLY regulated and EXTREMELY difficult to purchase.  The weapon used in this case was a semi-automatic rifle.  Most handguns are also semi-automatic.
849 2018-02-21 21:07:03 rarely take action to resolve the real issues at hand. When I see politicians limit large capacity magazines, bump stocks, increase the wait time for purchasing weapons of any kind and complete full background checks along with massively increasing mental health care we can say..
850 2018-02-21 21:07:02 Vegas was a different case. Vegas used a bump stock to transform the weapon into an automatic. Automatic weapons are banned and bump stocks should be too. Gun nuts will become a militia if you try to take their guns. Welcome to the real world

852 2018-02-21 21:06:59 the rifles like AR-15’s are not automatic and are legal (even in CA). Trump said yesterday that he wants something on banning bump stocks (used in Vegas), so that should help. We need more help when it comes to mental health issues

854 2018-02-21 21:06:54 Bump stocks not sticks, typo.
855 2018-02-21 21:06:32 I’m aware of this, but no one needs a device that essentially turns a semi automatic into a fully automatic weapon. This shouldn’t be considered ‘pandering to the left’. It should be called common sense. I’m all for owning guns, but no one needs bump stocks.
856 2018-02-21 21:06:20 @RepThomasMassie Can we ban assault weapons? Can we put an age restriction? Can we ban bump stocks? Background checks? Are you willing to do anything at all to prevent this happening in Kentucky?
857 2018-02-21 21:06:16 Am I the only one creeped out by how parallel stocks and some cryptos look?
Just as an aside.

860 2018-02-21 21:06:03 There’s some strong bipartisanship on background checks and banning bump stocks. And Trump, of all people, is pushing for gun reform ideas to be put on the table. This shooting definitely feels different than the others. There’s some movement actually happening
861 2018-02-21 21:05:56 Translation... Trump has asked his owners in the NRA if he's allowed to throw the public a meaningless bone by tweeting the possibility, then suggesting a ban on bump stocks, which they've already suggested they're open to, which of course won't matter. We need REAL gun control!

868 2018-02-21 21:04:28 Also it's a false notion that bump stocks turn guns into automatic weapons. They are still semi auto with a bump stock. Without googling, so I expect a quick reply. Do you know the difference between semi auto and fully auto?

875 2018-02-21 21:02:31 KInda late there buddy, Bump stocks have been sold out since Vegas. No reason for semi auto weapons to be legal in the first place.

•Universal background checks for all gun purchases
•Mandatory 3 day waiting period for all purchases 
•Eliminate high capacity magazines 
•Eliminate bump stocks 
•Mandatory training on fire arms every 5 years
890 2018-02-21 20:59:07 Do you think it’s enough to just ban bump stocks?  I think it’s a distraction from bigger issue- automatic weapons. But hey, I’m just a mom who got a robo call from my kids school yesterday that there was a copycat hoax called in but school on lockdown to verify.
891 2018-02-21 20:58:53 And now stocks are properly down.
892 2018-02-21 20:58:50 Bump stocks. Yeah, that'll fix things.
893 2018-02-21 20:58:48 Common sense gun control laws aren't focused on banning a gun... It's stricter reg. processes reinstated/passed by caps on mags, silencers, bump stocks; imposing more safety training, bg checks, mental health assessments & prosecuting dealers who continuously ignore the rules.
894 2018-02-21 20:58:47 @SenatorRisch STOP taking money from the NRA.  LIFE should always trump stupid money!  Vote for gun control laws that ban assault rifles and bump stocks and other stupid legislation! REALLY when is enough enough for you Mr. Risch? Please NO patronizing reply. We are sick of them.

901 2018-02-21 20:57:04 Now that stocks sold off so hard rates can head back down
902 2018-02-21 20:57:04 This is not enough. Mental health evals and background checks should be mandatory and conducted yearly. Straw sales should be a felony and heavily fined.  Bump stocks, assault weapons and any magazine over 10 rounds should be banned and result in a felony charge for possession.
903 2018-02-21 20:56:57 Rules help. Selling some into strength helps. #stocks #investing
904 2018-02-21 20:56:57 absolutely nothing. Trump has even called for much regulation on bump stocks.  There are people who want to abolish the second amendment entirely, that is the issue that makes the NRA and GOP so defensive
905 2018-02-21 20:56:51 What are you willing to compromise on? We do live in a democracy which only works with give and take. How about a ban on bump stocks for national reciprocity? Deal?
906 2018-02-21 20:56:39 There’s no need for a ban. That is part of the problem and why people are concerned about their second amend. Rights being eroded. I don’t have a problem w/expanded background checks & outlawing accessories (ie bump stocks) but stop with the banning nonsense.

910 2018-02-21 20:54:26 When the Second Amendment was written, were there bump stocks???
911 2018-02-21 20:53:54 You have some balls. "Holding bump stocks hostage."  Automatic weapons are hostages?  Stop a second and think about that. 

Un.Fucking.Believable.
912 2018-02-21 20:53:49 I believe we need stricter gun laws, stricter background checks and keeping the guns out of the hands of people that are mentally ill.  Would I be in favor of a ban on bump stocks....absolutely.  When do we put children's/people's  lives above guns.  Sitting idle isn't the answer

916 2018-02-21 20:53:28 And there were 17 young adults who died on February 14th in Florida.  They were special too.  And all you can do is ban bump stocks???
917 2018-02-21 20:52:54 How do you host a listening session? Its called presidenting like an adult. These are teenagers who deserve a real president to handle mass shootings and your govt ineptness. Kids are dying and thanks to you sales of bump stocks just rose. Yes we need to change
918 2018-02-21 20:51:51 @JoeNBC and how many more deaths will it take for Trump to take another step?  He's only promised to "look into" banning bump stocks, not to do anything.  So no thanks are due until TRUMP REALLY DOES SOMETHING

920 2018-02-21 20:51:26 As soon as people STOP   calling an AR15 an “Assault Rifle” we can then have a serious conversation about Sensible “Gun Laws”.  
1. Ban bump stocks. Agreed, ban them. 
2. Raise the age to buy a Pistol/Handgun and an AR15/AR10 or similar to 21. 
Ok, FINE. 
3. Mental illness
921 2018-02-21 20:51:15 He only went because they told him it would be insensitive to go golfing! He has no compassion, he also took $$$ from NRA. He only addressed bump stocks yesterday because he was told it would be bad optics to not do something!
922 2018-02-21 20:50:57 If it had been Obama proposing banning bump stocks, Conservatives would be loosing their minds and calling for revolution right about now....

930 2018-02-21 20:49:24 Do you find it kind of ironic he released the ban on bump stocks yesterday after pressure from victims when he knew of this problem months ago.
931 2018-02-21 20:49:01 Bump Stocks are not weapons  (arms) and therefore not protected by the 2nd A.  That means they can be banned. See how easy this is?
#GunReformNow
932 2018-02-21 20:48:48 What might Rev Graham expect you to do about gun control? Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and improve back ground checks. What have you actually accomplished? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You worship at the NRA. Vote Wittman out.
933 2018-02-21 20:48:37 I’ve been a cosponsor of H.R. 3947, the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, to ban bump stocks since October. That’s when a shooter used a bump stock to target concert goers in Las Vegas in what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
934 2018-02-21 20:48:28 Sign’s are for markets to go higher. I see .SPX & QQQ, XLK higher. stocks AAPL, GOOGL, Higher
935 2018-02-21 20:48:08 I'm a gun obsessed monster.I think background check should be mandatory.

936 2018-02-21 20:47:58 So, my previous employer has screwed me over royally and I'm unable to withdraw funds from my stocks I bought with them while employed there because the stock firm still has me listed as an active employee. It's been over a year since I was employed with them.

Motherfuckers...
937 2018-02-21 20:47:31 He actually did not ban bump stocks. He asked the DOJ to draft legal legislation. Very different.
938 2018-02-21 20:47:31 The dollar index hit a fresh high after briefly turning negative  and stocks gave back gains on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's  rate-setting committee, at its last policy meeting, showed more  confidence in the need to keep raising interest rates.
939 2018-02-21 20:47:26 @timwilliamsart so Trump says got to improve background checks, wants to do away with bump stocks.
940 2018-02-21 20:47:20 trump’s decision to regulate bump stocks was definitely a step in the right direction.

944 2018-02-21 20:46:33 @ShepNewsTeam Hey Shep before you jump on the bump stock band wagon do your due diligence. Bump stocks only enhance the ability to bump fire a semi-auto. You don't actually NEED a bump stock to fire a semi-auto like a fully automatic weapon. So what does banning it do? Nothing!
945 2018-02-21 20:46:25 Never will get rid of bump stocks, they are made on 3d printers now. Ban assault weapons. If you want to play with one join the army.
946 2018-02-21 20:46:09 Reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban would make bump stocks irrelevant.
947 2018-02-21 20:46:05 he doesn't even know what bump stocks are, he probably thinks he's banning bumper pool

962 2018-02-21 20:42:16 The NRA that supports banning bump stocks and making background information on mentally ill more accessible during background checks? Or maybe the ones that AREN’T involved in mass murders?

964 2018-02-21 20:41:31 There's not a lot of profit in bump stocks. It's a conspiracy to sell more guns. A president taking a stand perceived to be anti NRA will send people rushing out to purchase overpriced guns and ammo for fear the government is coming to get their weapons. FEAR Sells Guns. SAD!

992 2018-02-21 20:35:22 @POTUSPressPool Why is it OK to make bump stocks illegal because they turn a firearm automatic, but POTUS will not talk about making semi/automatic firearms illegal? The purpose of both is the same, to kill many people quickly.
993 2018-02-21 20:35:17 They're gonna try to make USD, UST rates & US stocks all rise at once.  They will eventually fail, but doesn't mean they can't try.
994 2018-02-21 20:34:44 Bump stocks are not needed. Or any modified gadgets.
995 2018-02-21 20:34:44 Retail buyers....come out, come out where ever you are.   The volume on these stocks are pathetic.
996 2018-02-21 20:34:33 Trump is not bullying students. He is meeting with them / he wants to do everything he can in the Executive Branch. He can make Orders for an emergency block for sale of bump stocks, sales of all guns to under 21, and FBI to follow up on actionable intel

2) raise age to buy any weapon to21
3) ban sales of all semi-automatic assault weapons
4) REPEAL law allowing individuals with mental health issues to buy guns.

1001 2018-02-21 20:34:08 What I want to know is where are the Dems? Why are they not uniformly, constantly, insisting on reinstating the assault weapon ban? 
I fear they don’t want to make waves, & hope they might get a temporary ban on bump-stocks or some other meaningless measure.
Dems, start leading!

1005 2018-02-21 20:33:35 If you think stricter gun purchase background checks will solve the problem your mental. Outlawing the ownership of AR'S and bump stocks is the only answer. No one needs assult rifles for target practice get real. Outlawing ownership is the answer.

C'mon already @jack, where is the Edit button?
1014 2018-02-21 20:32:14 There are bump stocks that are sold which make semi-automatic weapons, automatic. That’s why I’m bringing them up.
1015 2018-02-21 20:32:09 Because having bump stocks unavailable will certainly change everything.....I call BS you fool
1016 2018-02-21 20:32:05 I see progress. That’s a start but much more needs to be done. It won’t happen overnight but it will happen. They will ban bump stocks. I hope it helps. Time will tell. Florida’s shooting is the worst. It could have been prevented.

1019 2018-02-21 20:30:57 The best part of this whole situation is now Trump is trying to band Bump Stocks and other things that “turn regular guns into machine guns”. This goes against the NRA which he was originally for. It makes me laugh!! Its priceless!

1022 2018-02-21 20:30:25 You can do the same thing with a stick from your yard.

Crafting gun policy around bump stocks would bring out way too many Don Quixote references in a middle America increasingly powered by wind turbines for comfort in a nation where kids eat laundry soap as a “challenge”.

1024 2018-02-21 20:30:09 @KatiePavlich @EmilyMiller Please answer a question for me. If I remember correctly wasn’t bump stocks originally approved because of disabled individuals and veterans? I seem to recall that fight. If I’m wrong please correct me. I have never seen a need for one.
1025 2018-02-21 20:29:50 So @realDonaldTrump gets permission from the @NRA to ban bump stocks. Nothing more than a token gesture to appease the US public. Wouldn't want to risk those "campaign contributions" (read: bribes). Pathetic excuse of a man.
1026 2018-02-21 20:29:49 Liberals are loving his calls to ban bump stocks and tighten background checks.
1027 2018-02-21 20:29:36 Is a ban on bump stocks enough? #guncontrol
1028 2018-02-21 20:29:14 "Despite the fact that the Obama Admin approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least 2 occasions, the NRA is calling on the ATF  to immediately review whether these devices comply with  federal law," the NRA wrote in a statement.
1029 2018-02-21 20:29:09 Could do that all night lol.. might need more stocks though lol
1030 2018-02-21 20:28:49 I was surprised to hear the president asked to reexamine banning bump stocks
1031 2018-02-21 20:28:38 @scottsands Scott check out binary triggers. Bump stocks are fun, but not practical.  The LV shooter would have killed as many people, if not more and saved ammo without one.  Smoke and mirrors.
1032 2018-02-21 20:28:34 Disagree, it failed to have any effect, thus it was discontinued. Bump stocks may or may not be illegal, last I heard this was not clear. High capacity mags are illegal in many places but shouldn’t be. Again there’s no real benefit to doing it, and it infringes on rights.
1033 2018-02-21 20:28:27 My thoughts here is we try to take back 50 272.46 or we do go to 100dma in the next few days will see close to be sure $SPY #trade #stocks #investing
1034 2018-02-21 20:28:23 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE THAN THAT! GET RID OF THE BUMP STOCKS!! UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO GET RID OF POLICE, MILITARY, ETC., THEN NO ONE NEEDS A RIFLE LIKE THE AR-15 TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR TO COMMUTE MASS MURDER.

1036 2018-02-21 20:28:08 How about semis with bump stocks. Stop playing dumb, like you don't know how to make a semi turn fully (or act like it).
1037 2018-02-21 20:27:54 But why are they going after the NRA? They promote gun safety, against bump stocks, and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. They also help to keep the government from over reaching, something the ACLU use to do.
1038 2018-02-21 20:27:40 Absolutely true that @realDonaldTrump is not proposing anything the NRA opposes. The NRA was OK with banning bump stocks after Las Vegas and yet @GOP did nothing.
1039 2018-02-21 20:27:02 Many of these kids survived being attacked by machine gun. They have every right, by experience and the US Constitution, to rally for gun safety.  We all should. Anything you can do to push background cks, better data collection, banning bump stocks and AR-15s is a good thing.
1040 2018-02-21 20:27:01 Absolutely. And I'm in full agreement with you. And many conservatives support banning such add-ons. But that's just it, those are add-ons. Not stock items sold as part of an existing firearm. Regardless, I think it's very viable to see at least the bump stocks banned.
1041 2018-02-21 20:26:58 But have no problem with stocks going up 10% on earnings?
1042 2018-02-21 20:26:45 The majority of weapons used for mass killings are LEGAL semi-autos. Bump stocks can make them act like fully automatic weapons. Even though fully auto weapons have been made illegal, semis with bump stocks are legal. How's this for common sense: Don't sell semis OR bump stocks.
1043 2018-02-21 20:26:01 AR-15 supporters in Congress:  Banning Ar-15 butt stocks and replacing them with more comfortable foam rubber will  NOT save lives # GET REAL
1044 2018-02-21 20:26:01 The article talked about good facts but it didn’t tell you how they went about getting them off the streets. Let’s just say it would never work in the US. So besides making it harder to get a gun, banning bump stocks & machine guns how are we going to stop the people who kill?
1045 2018-02-21 20:25:43 it's like stock trading but the stocks don't have any companies behind them and you get nothing from having them
1046 2018-02-21 20:25:18 75% of gun owners who do have knowledge of guns support banning bump stocks.

You’re in a minority and on the wrong side of history.

1049 2018-02-21 20:24:31 Don’t worry, Trump is banning bump stocks and improving background checks. He’s listening. And step by step 2A will eroded.
1050 2018-02-21 20:24:22 Sure, it's those tired of being shot who are unreasonable:

America: "We need to strengthen background checks and close loopholes. Maybe restrict bump stocks and assault weapons?"

Cons: "OMG!! THEY'RE COMING FOR ALL OUR GUNS AND USING CRISIS ACTORS TO STEAL OUR RIGHTS!"

1058 2018-02-21 20:22:06 I am amazed that an american discussion on guns is all about a ban on bump stocks, the size of the magazines and/or about allowing 18-year olds and mentally unstable persons fully automatic assault (war) rifles. For us Europeans this is just f***ing crazy.

1060 2018-02-21 20:21:52 This, like anything else in security, is essentially an economic issue: how much effort must the bad person go to? Banning full auto and large magazines and bump stocks all raise the cost. Perfect? No, of course not, but nothing is, not even absolute bans, e.g., the war on drugs.

1071 2018-02-21 20:19:04 This is an uninformed comment. They have a narrow scope which they focus which is calling on legislators to act.

1086 2018-02-21 20:17:27 DOJ only regulates firearms and bump stocks aren't firearms.
1087 2018-02-21 20:17:07 The only thing dumber than bump stocks is banning bump stocks. Anyone proficient with a firearm isn't going to use full auto...much less a fucking bump stock.

1094 2018-02-21 20:15:35 I don't want automatic, semi-automatic or bump stocks in the possession of anyone in a  public home. I agree they should be sold. But I want mandatory law, they be kept at gun ranges. No one hunts with these weapons, so there's no reason to have them. Target shoot at a range.

1100 2018-02-21 20:14:32 Bump stocks are a novelty. But the ban isn't defined clearly. This could include trigger kits, spring kits etc.. These do not convert to full auto. However, it is a very slippery slope.
1101 2018-02-21 20:14:23 Trump is proposing a ban on Bump Stocks.

Changes to Background Checks to make them stricter.

More extensive action on Mental Health.

Adding more security to schools.

Let me guess, this isn’t enough for Liberals…. #GunReformNow
1102 2018-02-21 20:14:20 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks are not the only problem. You’ll need to do better than that. Take guns out of the hands of those convicted of a violent crime, mentally disturbed, and children under the age of 21.
1103 2018-02-21 20:13:51 how about banning bump stocks and assault rifles?  if you disgree, id love to hear your opinion.  Do you also know how much regulations and laws were changed after Timoth McVeigh killed allt hose people?  Why aren't you screaming for solutions as if this was Al Queda?
1104 2018-02-21 20:13:29 @MSDouglasHigh You are strong.
I graduated in 1968 but listening to the young people at MSD High, I am 17 and strong again. Ban Assault weapons, ban bump stocks and never forget all the carnage caused by crazy people with guns.

1109 2018-02-21 20:12:57 Don’t you stricter background checks should be done? The bump stocks shouldn’t be needed by private citizens in my opinion. This is the right thing to try. No more than that
1110 2018-02-21 20:12:57 Retail trading has an ugly record because it's hard to control your emotions.

1113 2018-02-21 20:12:30 Delusion at it's finest! Just because he says it doesn't make it so! So let's start with the stock market. Only 35% of Americans have money in the 401k program and only about 50% have stocks. So exactly who is doing well that would be the top 1%.

1117 2018-02-21 20:11:04 @DLoesch I am personally curious about your opinion on bump stocks.  As I understand, they are made to shoot bullets faster than the speed of a normal gun.  Do you feel they are necessary for sport shooting or hunting?
1118 2018-02-21 20:10:59 So many computers and not buying stocks ought to be a crime.
1119 2018-02-21 20:10:50 Stocks drop as fast as followers
1120 2018-02-21 20:10:46 @realDonaldTrump How about a compromise.  A ban on bump stocks for a national conceal carry?
1121 2018-02-21 20:10:44 Instead of trying for an outright ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, ask your state legislature to tax those sales.  If an assault rifle costs a thousand dollars more and a bump stock costs two hundred more, it will stop some people.

1123 2018-02-21 20:10:09 Trump can talk about banning bump stocks as they are a small operation. Doing so would not affect the major funders of the NRA. An assault weapons ban would hit the NRA in the pocketbook, so is unlikely to be endorsed by Trump
1124 2018-02-21 20:10:07 Banning Bump stocks is a joke. Fully automatic weapons are not very effective in a mass slaughter unless operated by the military. Semi automatic assault weapon is the weapon of choice for the actions in the school or by a swat team. Just more talk with no results.
1125 2018-02-21 20:09:54 Bump stocks should have been banned after Las Vegas. Bringing it back now is a cheap bone to throw at these Florida kids and a slap in the face to anyone with an ounce of common sense. We need to ban assault weapons like Reagan had the guts to do.

1131 2018-02-21 20:08:48 Ok people dont need to buy guns with large clips and or bump stocks to fire faster. Can we work on banning whatever label of gun those would fall under?

1134 2018-02-21 20:07:23 It’s more than just that. No semis, no bump stocks, no parts to convert pistols, thumbprint locks, truly universal background checks with no exceptions, mental health flags, etc. Whatever it takes to make mass shootings a less common occurrence. I know many gun owners who agree.
1135 2018-02-21 20:06:45 People buying these FANG stocks are losing their mind.  They were buying them like nothing happened two weeks ago.  We are coming to a seasonably weak period.   They deserve to get their clocks cleaned.

1137 2018-02-21 20:06:01 Bump stocks do not make weapons fully automatic.  And to top it off the rounds which is equivalent to a 223 round is no where near the most lethal round.  The actions of few, should not create confusion sequences for the majority.

1160 2018-02-21 20:03:01 He’s only banning them because the @nra said it’s ok you egotistical imbecile. It’s a political strategy because they know banning them won’t affect their bottom line. I doubt a shooter intending to commit mass murder will call it all off because bump stocks are banned.
1161 2018-02-21 20:02:57 We’ll believe it when we see it. Where are the bills to ban bump stocks and high-capacity magazines?
1162 2018-02-21 20:02:25 "The NRA doesn't approve of #bumpstocks . Even though they were approved by the Obama administration...."

Can you show me where they dont approve of bump stocks? The statement I am reading says they want them regulated and does not say how, just regulated.
1163 2018-02-21 20:02:20 Assault weapons should be banned. Bump stocks should be banned. High capacity magazine should be banned. None are needed to defend yourself in a world where the police are just a couple of minutes away.
1164 2018-02-21 20:02:18 Where is CNBC's daily reminder that stocks rally during rate hikes......
1165 2018-02-21 20:02:08 This is what he does best and then turns around and says he will ask for a ban on bump stocks knowing congress will vote against it!
1166 2018-02-21 20:02:05 We can have the 2nd Amendment & still institute sensible gun control legislation, which would give cops more tools to stop violent/ insane people from owning guns legally. How about making it illegal to sell bump stocks, which easily turn a semi automatic into fully automatic?
1167 2018-02-21 20:02:00 I'm calling emailing and marching with our kids for sensible gun laws. 21 is still too young for a person to buy an assault rifle. Age 25 minimum. Bump stocks ban totally.
1168 2018-02-21 20:01:49 Stocks extend gains after Fed minutes.  Strong economy!!
1169 2018-02-21 20:01:45 There is no reason anyone needs fully semi-automatic rifles in general, but they especially don't need military triggers, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines which would be a great place to start, in addition to better background checks.
1170 2018-02-21 20:01:33 IDK, Tyler. Anything that can be used to create a nat'l gun registry is a non-starter for many gun owners, including progressive ones (and I honestly don't blame them). I think GVROs, expanded b-ground checks & certain modification bans (like bump stocks) are more realistic.
1171 2018-02-21 20:00:43 My passion of stocks and investments came from my grandfather and dad who have been very successful investors. That being said, I'd like to dedicate my newest title promotion of Portfolio Management Director to my dad and Goong Goong.

1175 2018-02-21 19:59:26 Trump did one good thing so yes I agree that Bump Stocks should be banned. But Nikolas Cruz didn't have a Bump Stock on his AR-15. Trump and the Republikkkans need to provide money for better mental health programs as well. The obvious signs were there but choose to do nothing.
1176 2018-02-21 19:57:55 I dont think JUST taking away the guns is the answer. Law enforcement needs to be more responsible and act on hints and reports. Gun modifiers like bump-stocks need to be outlawed. Gun show loopholes addressed. Not just guns, but policy as well. #ParklandStudentsSpeak
1177 2018-02-21 19:57:35 $spx every tick lower in bonds they buy more stocks - dcf math makes perfect sense
1178 2018-02-21 19:57:09 I did not interpret the FED minutes to be as doveish as many others did.   The bond market did not budge.  Plenty of reasons for stocks to rally, but I view the FED still on course for 3 rate hikes in 2018.
1179 2018-02-21 19:57:05 Bump stocks and background checks? We have the federal government failing to enforce existing laws in 2 of the last 3 shootings and we’re @realDonaldTrump talking about bump stocks and background checks... @nra @goa #GunRights #GunControlNow
1180 2018-02-21 19:56:52 .@MikeDeWine campaign: "Both President Trump and the NRA have called for revisiting the way the federal government regulates bump stocks and we support the process US Attorney General Jeff Sessions is undertaking to do it." @MaryTaylorOH "does not advocate a ban on bump stocks."

1182 2018-02-21 19:56:37 *yawn*

Polling said Hillary was going to win the popular vote by 2 to 3 percent. 

That happened.

Polling was never out by more than a few percent.

75% of gun owning households backed a ban on bump stocks in a recent poll.

1186 2018-02-21 19:54:44 Wondering exactly who and what would be harmed by banning weapons of war in the US. Who would be harmed by raising the age you can buy a gun? Who would be harmed by not being able to make a weapon automatic (bump stocks)? Who would be harmed by stricter background checks?

1195 2018-02-21 19:53:29 Banning bump stocks is easy because not many people use them. Guns should be registered, that's not unconstitutional. I propose a ban on AR-15 style weapons. Weapons of war shouldn't be on American streets.
1196 2018-02-21 19:53:25 2/2 You could confiscate 90% of legal AR's and there would still be hundreds of thousands of illegal guns.  Ditto on bump stocks.  Ditton on basically everything.

1198 2018-02-21 19:52:53 Sen. Schumer, I love you, Lol. It should ALL be banned. But expanded background checks, and banning bump stocks, STILL wouldn't have stopped the killer in Parkland, Florida. Banning assault weapons, for military use ONLY. #NEVERAGAIN
1199 2018-02-21 19:52:48 @DonaldJTrumpJr No new restrictions on guns. No ban on bump stocks. No age requirement increases. I've never sold a bump stock, but it's simply a plastic stock connected to a plastic grip. Outlandish for government to tell gun owners what kind of plastic stock they can use.

1216 2018-02-21 19:48:13 I thought he said he wrote a "memo" asking that they take a look at bump stocks. It seemed as if it was all an act so he looks as if he's doing something.

1220 2018-02-21 19:47:35 7/15 - Moreover, ETFs conformation allows: 
1. Enhanced returns in favourable environments. 
2. Improved returns in sideways markets.
3. Reduced portfolio volatility under adverse conditions.

1221 2018-02-21 19:47:32 Don't bother banning bump stocks. 
You can have the same effect as a bump stock 
by simply looping your thumb around a belt loop or 
even just keeping your finger just a short distance away 
for the trigger after the first shot fired.
It's just using the recoil to fire faster.
1222 2018-02-21 19:47:16 Bump stocks make a semi-auto like the AR fully auto. Plus 50 round banana clips can be bought anywhere.
1223 2018-02-21 19:47:14 Funny how GOP has sat on doing anything about bump stocks for 4 months and now suddenly it is their idea to fix everything.
1224 2018-02-21 19:47:13 Is he now " Long of " stocks?
1225 2018-02-21 19:47:12 Powerful bankers help create them, then they short the stocks and markets and crash them -- there's the real answer.
1226 2018-02-21 19:47:09 I said to ban totally??  This is just hopeless.  Should  not have bothered having a rational discussion .  Kids are dying because of ridiculous gun laws.  Bump stocks??? Wtf
1227 2018-02-21 19:47:06 Also prior to EU membership, many of our waters were overfished and fish stocks down. Not any more!
1228 2018-02-21 19:46:59 I switched from @Scottrade to @CharlesSchwab before the @TDAmeritrade merger BECAUSE of many reviews I read online about the excessively long TDA hold times. I never anticipated needing their assistance, but that was the main reason I switched before the transfer. Good luck!
1229 2018-02-21 19:46:54 There are Indian companies who seem to be doing well if you look at their offices/buildings/junkets/fleets of cars, but their stocks have hardly moved over a decade.

The promoters and the CEOs/COOs etc steal too much from their own companies.
1230 2018-02-21 19:46:42 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS respectfully Sir, please do not alter the age to buy a gun or ban bump stocks. The Second Amendment is too important to erode! I voted for a candidate who pledged to preserve the Second Amendment and YOU were that candidate. Please don’t give in.
1231 2018-02-21 19:46:35 Unless you want to blame Obama for the mass murders that happened while he was in office.  If I'm not mistaken there were several that happened in his tenure.  He did nothing to stop them.  Didn't @POTUS say he wanted to ban bump stocks yesterday? He at least is making an attempt
1232 2018-02-21 19:46:27 1) Ban bump stocks
2) Universal background checks
3) Assault rifle ban
4) Properly fund mental health
5) Make gun violence a health and safety issue.
6) Congress needs to worry about the American people instead of the influx of money from the NRA.
1233 2018-02-21 19:46:23 Invested in some stocks and just got a text saying my portfolio is up 12% now that may not seem like a lot but over time it’ll all start to add up especially considering my initial investment 
1234 2018-02-21 19:46:21 Finally, March bonds are challenging 143'00, but technicals are showing "over sold" condition. Analysts are still confused about the correlations between stocks, notes, and bonds because if rates up up too fast and too much, equities lose momentum. That could be what's happening.
1235 2018-02-21 19:46:15 If they cared about #gunsafety they would have banned bump stocks after the Vegas shooting. They’re trying to distract and placate the movement with empty gestures
1236 2018-02-21 19:46:08 And the reaction of #markets , #stocks and #bonds , suggests general confidence that the #Fed will be able to continue with its "beautiful normalization" of monetary policy -- that is, higher rates and declining balance sheet without major disruptions to the #economy and markets.
1237 2018-02-21 19:45:51 US stocks have taken the minutes from the January FOMC meeting--which were released 45 mina ago--in stride, ticking to new session highs.
1238 2018-02-21 19:45:43 And now, the #GOP may be interested in supporting a bill to ban bump stocks not because Trump may flip and say it needs to be done but because they don't want to lose their jobs. Beware, after 11/18, they will become their real selves.
1239 2018-02-21 19:45:33 And I want to know is who is the market for bump stock manufacturers? For what purpose would any non-military person purchase something to make their rifle into a machine gun? How many bump stocks are sold each year? At last I agree with Trump on one thing.
1240 2018-02-21 19:45:30 Yes, and the govt has a right to legislate their availability.

You’re in an tiny minority in not wanting bump stocks banned, even a large majority of Gun owners want them banned.
1241 2018-02-21 19:45:27 I now have a full position in $LTBR. Idk if there is a better looking chart out there  but it looks to have found multiple day support at the $1.46 and has huge upside potential. First price target is $1.80-$2.   #stocks #trading #money #invest #Trade #Stockstowatch

1243 2018-02-21 19:44:55 Weapons of war I carried in combat have no place on our streets.

For starters:

Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines

Close the gun show and private sale loopholes

Limit the number of weapons and amount of ammunition that can be purchased at any time

1248 2018-02-21 19:44:01 Thanks? This is bullshit. Trump could’ve banned bump stocks immediately after Vegas, but instead he held this “NRA sacrificial lamb” of a concession for another day. Now they want everyone to say “Thank You,” but what about the AR15s that keep killing Americans?
1249 2018-02-21 19:43:58 The only gambling I do is stocks
1250 2018-02-21 19:43:52 The action of your stocks is a key indicator of mkt conditions. Are stock following through from buy points or not? Are your stocks holding up or failing en masse? No indicator will give that information to you.
1251 2018-02-21 19:43:43 Meanwhile, in the U.K., and I would guess across Europe too, nobody knows or cares what bump stocks are, as few of us have, or have the slightest interest in, guns or consider them an essential part of our lives
1252 2018-02-21 19:43:36 Deflecting I see! If that's the case then this now downward spiral of stocks is your fault....and last year's incline which you took credit for was his fault then. Guess who is winning?

1254 2018-02-21 19:43:28 he didn't ban bump stocks.   read the thread by @EricColumbus
1255 2018-02-21 19:43:27 These things should happen in the next 30 days:
Ban AR15 for military use only. 0 justification for civilians to have them.
Ban bump stocks 
Take the money for the wall & use it to install metal detectors in EVERY school in the US.
Raise the gun buying age limit

1256 2018-02-21 19:43:25 Lets knock the stocks back down again
1257 2018-02-21 19:43:15 Under Obama's Adm bump stocks were approved. Go figure. @realdonaldtrump has inherited a politicized-weaponized mess. FACT: You are no challenge to President Trump, he listens to We The People US Citizens not outsiders.
What about UK school children groomed as sexual slaves? ???
1258 2018-02-21 19:43:14 Now that Bump Stocks are illegal, let’s hope Bitcoin raises in value
1259 2018-02-21 19:43:08 STOP WITH THE PENNY DAY TRADING. UR MESSING WITH THE MARKETS!! Or IS THIS BEING DONE FOR THAT PURPOSE ALSO. STOCKS SHOULD B HIGH R GETTING MESSED WITH BY PENNY DAY TRADERS!!
1260 2018-02-21 19:43:03 Please just state facts. You do not know if that’s true or not. Stop exploiting these kids. Ban Bump stocks, high capacity mags, Vets for Armed school security. Increase age to buy a gun. More funding for mental health. Hopefully that solves it
1261 2018-02-21 19:43:01 Obviously you haven't even looked at the article.  So look up other articles about what bump stocks can do with AR 15s. Even the Florida legislature and now, Trump are becoming aware of that.
1262 2018-02-21 19:42:56 People are taking my tweets out of context. I don’t have any problems with the kids. They’re still the victims and we need to remember they are grieving. They deserve to be heard. I just don’t think we need to ban the weapon. Ban the bump stocks and put tighter background checks.
1263 2018-02-21 19:42:43 The only gambling I do is stocks

1265 2018-02-21 19:42:39 @realDonaldTrump for the record Sir there are no Machine guns, there is no such thing as an assault riffle. And no bump stocks
1266 2018-02-21 19:42:33 The somewhat dovish Fed minutes pushes Stocks higher. Dow +275 points.

1268 2018-02-21 19:42:23 Don’t be mad bro. Maybe Trump will ban bump stocks for you.
1269 2018-02-21 19:42:19 Stocks add to gains after the minutes released.
1270 2018-02-21 19:41:33 @realDonaldTrump Keep your promises to those of us who voted you into office. That mean NO further infringements on the 2nd amendment! Banning bump stocks will not save lives, it will just grease the slippery slope! Banning any firearms or accessories will not help #MAGA
1271 2018-02-21 19:41:30 Nothing wrong with that! We do not need bump stocks.

1278 2018-02-21 19:40:43 @realDonaldTrump You made a big deal out of signing a MEMO banning bump stocks, directing Sessions to "look into it". If ur serious, why not sign an #ExecutiveOrder NOW, followed by the same on #AssaultWeaponsBan? You haven't done anything to convince me OR the #ParklandStudents.

1299 2018-02-21 19:37:54 Probably because he told you to ask him about banning bump stocks.
1300 2018-02-21 19:37:34 Post the link where the #NRA sells bump stocks or makes any  $ from the sale of #bumpstocks .

1310 2018-02-21 19:36:16 Bump stocks are ridiculous to own or use, however they do not turn a semi into an auto rifle and I have no prob with people who love to waste their ammo having one.

1313 2018-02-21 19:35:42 Well that would explain why he has moved to ban bump stocks and tighten gun laws ...
1314 2018-02-21 19:35:38 It took him 3 1/2 months after Las Vegas to “sign a memo” asking the Justice Dept to “look into” the bump stock issue.He waited until he was pressured by public reaction to a shooting that apparently did not involve bump stocks. This is just one more deflect & delay tactic.
1315 2018-02-21 19:35:31 No need to ban semi automatic rifles when they have the same fire rate as a pistol. Ban the bump stocks
1316 2018-02-21 19:35:26 No shame. Wear your socks and stocks LOUD and PROUD.
1317 2018-02-21 19:35:20 Bonds are getting annihilated, this is not good for stocks peeps.. Not good at all..

1319 2018-02-21 19:35:14 From your article. “In all, just 54% of Americans invest in the market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401(k), according to Gallup.” My overall % must of been our dated. But still a majority. 1/
1320 2018-02-21 19:33:53 My opinion cud b wrong.  I don't invest much in stocks so my opinion isn't included in mr market's sums.
1321 2018-02-21 19:33:29 If Democrats really wanted to ban bump stocks they would have done it when they held the White House and majority in Congress. Funny how Trump seems to be the only one who's about to change talk into action.

1324 2018-02-21 19:33:11 Honestly banning bump stocks doesn't really solve anything, it's just a reactionary tactic.

1326 2018-02-21 19:32:51 Oh, that's priceless. Obama took credit for the ever-growing economy, until the market made an adjustment. Tell ya what. I promise not to bring up Obama each time I deposit my increased paychecks and when i exercise my stocks. No excuses for Trump. No credit for Obama
1327 2018-02-21 19:32:44 Mark my words. The NRA will allow their puppets to use a crumb like bump stocks and use rhetoric like they are on the sides of youth to tighten school security to quiet the young voices. Then back to the shit show. #NeverAgain #TheResistance
1328 2018-02-21 19:32:36 I'm hoping for ' I am the first person who wanted to ban bump stocks, no one has mentioned it before, I also invented words and hair...etc etc'

1331 2018-02-21 19:32:13 Mark my words: T will announce he’s banning bump stocks when he meets w survivors later this week as a token. He thinks that will be enough. It’s NOT & these kids are going to make sure he knows it. More POWER to THEM  #ParklandStudentsSpeak
1332 2018-02-21 19:32:10 Not sure on that one, just make sure you have yourself protected if this thing rolls. This action just took out the biggest crowd and caused the most pain. Too many people had higher rates/lower stocks trades on. They just got squeezed. Let's see if mo continues after those gone
1333 2018-02-21 19:31:53 How responsible and lawful are bump stocks? I bet the NRA likes to cash in on those!

To what extent are 'EU stocks' bars explained by a) several TACs not fished at MSY with very low TACs (i.e. due to their poor state e.g. Irish Sea sole and whiting)? and/or b) several larger (tonnage) TACs fished at MSY (e.g. herring, n. hake, etc)?

1348 2018-02-21 19:29:39 As far as I'm concerned, people can be allowed to have all the bump stocks they want, as long as they aren't allowed the assault rifles to go with them.

1356 2018-02-21 19:28:17 Why is Trump writing a memo to AG to come up with a ban on bump stocks when he could issue an EO?

Because it is mainly a diversion...Giving the appearance that something is being done until everything calms down and people beginning to forget.
1357 2018-02-21 19:28:12 That's the only reason he has suggested to ban bump stocks.
1358 2018-02-21 19:27:59 Don't fall for it- Trump's banning 'bump stocks' is a ruse only intended to alleviate pressure from passing any meaning gun control legislation
1359 2018-02-21 19:27:58 IF you let democrat or republican change or mess with the costitition once it would set a president to do it over an over again that's why democrats start small with gun mags an stocks
1360 2018-02-21 19:27:55 @SpeakerRyan WHY doesn't President Trump SIGN an EXECUTIVE ODER to BAN BUMP STOCKS and AR-15 WEAPONS?
1361 2018-02-21 19:27:51 @realDonaldTrump  You are being misled by ignorant advisers on the issue of bump stocks. They are a "wedge issue" with no value except to get gun-banners' foot in the door. Talk to some people who know firearms technology who don't have an agenda.
1362 2018-02-21 19:27:42 Trump took 30 Million from the NRA. There is no way he doesn't do whatever they tell him to. You wont even get 7 Republican votes in the senate to ban bump stocks. #NeverAgain
1363 2018-02-21 19:27:40 Who'd have thought, after Mandalay Bay, that our senior senator would still not outlaw bump stocks. Who'd have thought it would turn out to be the #MoronInChief who would lead the way. You're a coward. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
1364 2018-02-21 19:27:38 Banning bump stocks will be the foot in the door the Democrats and left want. Recreational gun accessories will all be scrutinized.
1365 2018-02-21 19:27:31 @realDonaldTrump WHY doesn't President Trump SIGN an EXECUTIVE ODER to BAN BUMP STOCKS and AR-15 WEAPONS?
1366 2018-02-21 19:27:31 Ok, let’s have a dialogue. This thread is about pursuing some level of gun control in the wake of yet another mass school shooting using an AR15.   Wd making it somewhat more difficult to obtain an AR15, high capacity magazines and bump stocks be a horrible inconvenience for U?
1367 2018-02-21 19:27:06 Mid-Day: Stocks are higher and MBS unchanged after recent reports currently.

1370 2018-02-21 19:26:57 I am very happy that President Trump wants a ban on bump stocks. If this saves ONE life, it is priceless.  More needed! #EnoughIsEnough #POTUS
1371 2018-02-21 19:26:50 I am a little concerned that the House/Senate might do some pittance of a thing, like outlaw bump stocks, and then say they "did something."
1372 2018-02-21 19:26:46 Or maybe it will become a self fulfilling prophecy and the goverment is coming to take their guns bc people are sick and tired of trying to get NRA to be reasonable. THEY STILL SUPPORT BUMP STOCKS. #GunReformNow #NRA

1374 2018-02-21 19:26:33 @realDonaldTrump Ur answer is ban  BUMP STOCKS.  It's ASSAULT RIFLES THAT killed 17 more people in Parkland not a Bump Stock. Get real and do one right thing in your SICK life. Save our KIDS!
1375 2018-02-21 19:26:32 Well they’re semi automatic, I think bump stocks are the problem. Not a weapon with a similar fire rate to a handgun
1376 2018-02-21 19:26:11 @RealDonaldTrump - Banning bump stocks is fine and dandy - and meaningless,  just like your illegitimate "so-called presidency."
#Cruz didn't gun down 17 innocent kids whose blood is on YOUR hands with a bump stock.  BAN assault weapons!

1380 2018-02-21 19:25:53 If you're a parent, & do not want common sense #GunReform including a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers, tighter background checks, & restriction on DV/mentally ill/no fly from buying firearms, you're NOT fit to raise a child.

1381 2018-02-21 19:25:43 Very true. It definitely has me pinned to the sideline for now.

#wallstreet #stocks #bitcoin #ethereum
1383 2018-02-21 19:24:51 @DanaPerino it should be a no brainer that bump stocks should be banned. What most don't realize is that law makers try to insert verbiage into the text of new laws that prohibits mods to parts like triggers and such. Laws would ban many after market upgrades which are now legal.
1384 2018-02-21 19:24:37 I’ve gotta say, what Chung CNN and listening to the dotards defend assault rifles and bump stocks, keep cutting mental health and accusing these kids of being bought makes me scream.
1385 2018-02-21 19:24:17 Why would they be his down fall? He already called for a ban on bump stocks etc. And no one blamed Obama and there where more mass shootings during his admin. than any other. So I really am not understanding why everything is trumps fault when he has been in Office for a year....

1387 2018-02-21 19:23:36 Congratulations to you, Piers, on the decision to ban bump stocks. In my opinion, this decision was entirely down to your lobbying. Well done.
1388 2018-02-21 19:23:31 You want bump stocks, we want suppressors removed from the NFA.

You want 30 round magazines banned, we want National reciprocity.

You want to repeal the 2nd Amendment, we'll see you in Hell.
1389 2018-02-21 19:23:21 I hope you've invested in toothbrush stocks and/or have a solid dental plan.
1390 2018-02-21 19:23:17 What’s so hard about compromise?
• Keep the second amendment but make it really hard to obtain an assault rifle and make bump stocks illegal.
• Have your religious views but keep them out of school and politics.
1391 2018-02-21 19:23:05 This tiny handed putz is so full of himself it's crazy, there needs to be a outright ban on ARs & high cap mags not just bump stocks.
1392 2018-02-21 19:23:03 So 45 decides to toss a bone by banning bump stocks...not good enough!

1394 2018-02-21 19:22:33 Danger here is a surprise bond and note rally that could spook expectations.  The FED gave no indication on whether the economy is doing better or worse.  Equities crashed in fear of higher interest rates.  If bonds drop from here, stocks could get blown out, again.  Tentative!
1395 2018-02-21 19:22:29 Stocks rally because .. ummm .. Fed says ...

""Amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by nonfinancial corporations, several participants cautioned that imbalances in financial markets may begin to emerge as the economy continued to operate above potential."

1398 2018-02-21 19:22:09 Agree, my question is when is the good management going to start. If a farmer  was to manage his crops in the same way many stocks R managed, then much of his crop would rot on the root.

1401 2018-02-21 19:21:32 Trump trying to look responsible by "banning" bump stocks - any fool with a 3d printer can make one at home, they are just a simple mechanical device. Why not ban all semi-automatics - then they can't be converted to full auto with a bump stock.
1402 2018-02-21 19:21:24 Dow jumps 240 points after Fed minutes, with stocks drifting near session highs

1408 2018-02-21 19:20:18 Fomc minutes signal all fed officials agree on aggressive rate hikes. Positive for dollar, but very bearish on Stocks and commodities including Gold and crude oil. Dow and Nasdaq pared some of gains
1409 2018-02-21 19:20:15 @realDonaldTrump What's needed is a ban on semi-automatics, military style weapons & banning bump stocks!
Duh!!!!
1410 2018-02-21 19:20:15 Not nearly enough. Bump stocks were supposed to be banned after Las Vegas. The issue with Parkland, Sandy Hook and so many more atrocities is semiautomatic weapons. Do you support continued sales of those weapons? #EndGunViolence #indivisible19 #DefeatFaso
1411 2018-02-21 19:19:58 I do use a very specific set of criteria, everyone should have a system they use to define when / where they buy and sell or short stocks.

1413 2018-02-21 19:19:42 Gun show private sales are such a minute percentage of sales.  Bump stocks I agree and the mentally ill don’t usually get diagnosed till after they shoot
1414 2018-02-21 19:19:42 ha, so true, in the pot stocks they all go up and down simultaneously too, we live in the matrix so the key is just have fun, and pretend to go along or they send in a sentinel and snag you out of your warm fluid bath.
1415 2018-02-21 19:19:32 We can't accept Trump's petty gesture of banning bump stocks as enough. Too little, too late. We need complete #GunReformNow! Comprehensive background checks, banning all assault rifles, and more funding for people with mental illnesses would be just a start.
1416 2018-02-21 19:19:27 Snap market reaction to Fed minutes? Dollar falls, stocks rise, yield curve steepens, precious metals rise. Who knows if it'll stick, or if it's a "first move is a false move" situation like on many other Fed event days though ...
1417 2018-02-21 19:19:16 Stocks rally on a Fed that is hiking rates to stop the stock rally
1418 2018-02-21 19:19:14 Could be some progress from the WH on getting bump stocks banned. That I'd be in total agreement with. A number of states already have 10 rnd mag capacities (here in Canada it's 5!), so gradually that's happening too.
1419 2018-02-21 19:18:56 @jimcramer It's me again. Booooo-Yaaaah!!!!
1. Why don't stocks in the Real Estate sector have positive Retained Earnings? 

2. Does $BRKA have any holding in Real Estate via Stock Exchange?
1420 2018-02-21 19:18:56 I'm watching these amazing kids confront the status quo & listening to the reporters discuss it. 1 said the NRA indicated they were willing to discuss bump stocks. My question us why do we care what they're willing to discuss? They're a business, not law makers. We tell them!
1421 2018-02-21 19:18:38 i'm lost in the woods now....have no idea how much longer the FED wants to delay the action and stop pumping up stocks, but sure it going to end in a disaster and will take the economy as well. Nice job FED, tap on your shoulder and have Donald duck cheer for your fantastic work!
1422 2018-02-21 19:18:35 Yet another warning from the Fed that their Frankenstein market is "elevated"=buy stocks dumbass.
1423 2018-02-21 19:18:33 Yeah that’s the other thing. Stock market shits itself and nobody is saying “see we’ve been telling you that stocks don’t work”
1424 2018-02-21 19:18:30 The kid didn't have a criminal record, a background check wouldn't have stopped him. Even if the FBI had done their job, the law wouldn't have permitted them to take the gun. We need red flag laws, we need need to get rid of bump stocks, and we need to stop selling assault rifles

1426 2018-02-21 19:18:21 But the NRA is still donating.. Trump did at least come out and pushed things forward. I have no idea what you saying that has to do with Obama, he had the chance to make changes and didn’t. Scary trump is pushing to ban bump stocks and strengthen background check, scary stuff
1427 2018-02-21 19:18:18 Yes ban extended mags, yes ban bump stocks. But calling for reasonable gun laws when you really mean a ban is disingenuous because I’d say a vast majority agree with banning what I said, the NRA too.
1428 2018-02-21 19:18:09 A blanket gun ban won’t work But banning bump stocks and limiting magazines capacities is a step in right direction thst most can agree on

1434 2018-02-21 19:17:30 Glad this has been recognised however you are still forging ahead with MSY on some stocks that you know are data deficient and will choke industry you can't play it both ways. The effect will be vessels tied up for long periods because of lack of data.
1435 2018-02-21 19:17:24 Yeah exactly my point. It does nothing. It's just pandering to rightful cries of some sort of action to be taken against the over obundance of gun violence. It doesn't have any significant impact. I mean how many bump stocks or yet alone guns that support it do u own?
1436 2018-02-21 19:17:23 He does not. He has rolled out the ridiculous "bump stocks" concession the NRA coached him to hold in his back pocket, but bump stocks are both unreliable and misrepresented for what they do by the NRA.
1437 2018-02-21 19:17:15 The way you backed down on bump stocks
1438 2018-02-21 19:17:06 Hey Criminals were are going to raise the age to legally purchase rifles and outlaw stocks... Ok now you can't get them or use them!! 
See how simple that was, just like illegal drugs!
Oh I forgot criminals don't follow the law! 
Honest people do!
1439 2018-02-21 19:17:00 Bump stocks were not used in Parkland. Adults also use assault weapons for mass murder. Raising age is not going to make a huge difference. BAN of these weapons and high-volume magazines, funding for mental health the answer.

1444 2018-02-21 19:15:59 Stocks are backed by P&L, physical assets as part of a revenue producing business which is then valued accordingly. Buying a ‘share’ of a player (backed by absolutely nothing in his case), is definitely make-believe
1445 2018-02-21 19:15:53 Trump: What is the smallest thing I can do to make it look like I'm doing something?

Trump: I'm going to take steps to ban bump stocks!

We need to do more.

1446 2018-02-21 19:15:51 Banning bump stocks is a start. It's like saying nuclear bombs have to be red instead of blue so you can see them coming.

1449 2018-02-21 19:15:12 @KatyTurNBC Senator Feinstein confirms that an executive order or regulation will not be a true ban on bump stocks. It has to be a law, a bill passed through the legislature.

1452 2018-02-21 19:14:42 So you don't think the recent Florida tragedy had anything to do with him feeling pressured to ban bump stocks and it was all your doing?

1454 2018-02-21 19:14:27 It should be noted that legally speaking, the Fed is not permitted to make direct stock purchases. However, there is nothing to prevent it from funding a Special Purpose Vehicle that could then buy stocks through indexes or Exchange Traded Funds.
1455 2018-02-21 19:14:27 It's great that you recognize our law enforcement. Help them do their jobs by supporting the elimination of bump stocks, background checks

1462 2018-02-21 19:13:23 Stocks have been on a relentless tear since Donald Trump won the presidency in November 2016. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 42% and continues to break records on a regular basis.

1477 2018-02-21 19:11:28 I'm am a pretty pro fun firearm person, but I will admit, bump stocks,  30 and larger round mags need to go.  Get rid of instant background checks and go to a 14 or 30 day model would be a good start.

1482 2018-02-21 19:11:17 p.s. Trump's proposed ban on bump stocks, if implemented, doesn't count (though I'll be the first to commend him if that happens)
1483 2018-02-21 19:10:57 To make effective change we need to start with a 14 -day waiting period for purchase, universal background checks, a ban on bump stocks, a ban on all assault waepons, a national minimum age of purchase at age 21, and it is imperative to institute campaign finance reform NOW.
1484 2018-02-21 19:10:55 He just banned bump stocks as a modification for assault rifles? You still sure he’s an NRA pawn?
1485 2018-02-21 19:10:35 Don't get me wrong its great that trump is directing the justice department to ban bump stocks but that's way too late, it shouldn't take a school shooting to enact change, this is a single step in a marathon. #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #FloridaShooting #FloridaSchoolShooting
1486 2018-02-21 19:10:30 Things that should be illegal:
Assault weapons
Magazines that hold more than 10 rounds
Silencers
Bump stocks or any conversion of semi to automatic
armor piercing bullets
Feel free to add to this list
1487 2018-02-21 19:10:17 You are trying to argue it with me like I'm a liberal who wants to get rid of all guns, I understand your point, but at the same time making it illegal makes it harder to get. No ones going to be on street corners selling bump stocks.
1488 2018-02-21 19:09:54 I am all for fixing the moral decay of our society but in the meantime lets stop new sales of bump stocks and semi automatic weapons and make all gun sales require back ground checks.

1494 2018-02-21 19:09:19 Trump cannot ban bump stocks. Nor, can the ATF.
1495 2018-02-21 19:09:16 I would add that Bump Stocks and background checks are too.
1496 2018-02-21 19:09:04 Good. Glad you agree. Bump stocks should be the next to go too. Guns need to be restricted to certain people
1497 2018-02-21 19:08:55 Amazing how the chart setup going into the meeting (bullish consolidation just under the highs of the day) tells the coming move in stocks. It's all big money, knowing ahead of time and accumulating. That causes the pattern formation.
1498 2018-02-21 19:08:54 I guess higher rates are now good for stocks ---
1499 2018-02-21 19:08:49 Obama gave the OK for bump stocks. He missed several opportunities to make good when the Democrats controlled the 3 branches of government. After so many years of Dems in control and pushover Republicans. Why is this still an issue?

1502 2018-02-21 19:08:00 Sure, because every time there’s a mass killing, sickos think the ban may come so they rush out and buy the gun before it is prohibited. And so stocks go up because the money-grubbers see the opportunity. Yes, dead kids sell guns! That’s America for you!
1503 2018-02-21 19:07:44 I don’t think buying make-believe stocks counts as being a fucking trader either.
1504 2018-02-21 19:07:38 Actually, some have decided to give up the bump stocks. Concentrate on individual shot precision instead of multiple shots. But you keep up your narrative, we'll be just fine.
1505 2018-02-21 19:06:56 ooooh ban bump stocks. or at least, propose it. trump won't oppose any gun control. its another money fund that he's in the pocket of.  #c4news
1506 2018-02-21 19:06:54 Undoubtedly, a grassy knoll is involved. Well, at least Trump is banning bump stocks. Or is he?

1508 2018-02-21 19:06:41 3. Government eventually defaults on debt (most of which is held by Americans in their retirement portfolios because of the perceived safety). This would be a nightmare for those close to retirement who hold fewer stocks and more bonds, wiping out their lifesavings
1509 2018-02-21 19:06:34 I don't think there's one single solution. I think there's room for different solutions. Banning assault style rifles and bump stocks is a start. At least changing the age where one can buy one should be done. You can't buy a beer but you can buy an assault rifle...makes sense.
1510 2018-02-21 19:06:29 UPDATE: Stocks move higher slightly after Fed minutes
1511 2018-02-21 19:06:28 Vegas shooter didnt modify any firing setup to shoot more than 1 bullet per trigger pull. He used what i already said, bump fire stocks, which just spring the recoil back allowing you to pull the trigger faster. Can do the same thing just holding the gun a certain way without 2/2
1512 2018-02-21 19:06:11 Bump stocks were made legal during Obama’s reign.  Thanks POTUS 44
1513 2018-02-21 19:06:06 #NEVERAGAINMOVEMENT

The ONLY REASON Bump Stocks
have made it back into conversation and news, since Las Vegas, is because THESE CHILDREN were massacred in Parkland, Florida.

In addition, legislation is
"on the table", to raise the 
legal gun buying age to 21.

1516 2018-02-21 19:05:32 Ban the Bump Stocks if the criminals want one they will get one . (period) 
EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE 
1517 2018-02-21 19:05:29 No president Trump is pushing to limit/restrict bump stocks. They are easily manufactured, but have a high failure rating. This is one view as to why the Las Vegas shooter had so many guns. Many jammed up.
1518 2018-02-21 19:05:23 And trust me Im far from his biggest fan, but props to Trump for bypassing congress and banning bump stocks.
1519 2018-02-21 19:05:19 @POTUS This imo does not add up unless she has been privy to some insider trading leaks, like what sent Martha Stewart to prison.   Even if an inheritance occurred or big windfall on stocks she owned, I doubt she could of amassed that kind of net worth.

1524 2018-02-21 19:04:41 As the #ParklandStudentsSpeak, are they and others happy that President Trump has ordered the ban of bump stocks for guns?
1525 2018-02-21 19:04:15 Lois I'm a conservative gun owner. I've been in law enforcement for 26 years. I agree something needs to be done. We need to ban more guns for non law enforcement. Ban all parts that turn weapons from semi auto to full auto. More than bump stocks. Raise age limit.
1526 2018-02-21 19:04:10 Nor should you suggest that we need to get rid of bump stocks and other things that we like on our firearms.  Frankly I'm tired of the Law Abiding Citizen having to pay for some Maniac that walks into a school and shoots up a bunch of kids problem.
1527 2018-02-21 19:03:50 $OLVI nice smack! Lets see .20s!
1528 2018-02-21 19:03:48 A very good article and agree with the sentiment (and the comment re #bitcoin being simple S&D). 

I've done VCTs myself to see them from the inside. Wouldn't recommend anything to a client unless I'd be prepared to put my own cash in.
1529 2018-02-21 19:03:46 I thought I read that even bump stocks are illegal. They’ll have to really crack down on the sales somehow.
1530 2018-02-21 19:03:33 Hence the reason Congress shouldn't be allowed to legislate another gun law or reinstate the assault weapons ban because they don't know what they are talking about AND they are dangerous with legal wording. I'm not opposed to banning bump stocks OR raising the age limit BTW.
1531 2018-02-21 19:03:30 Pray for it ! This law on bump stocks isn't enforceable. The sellers will hide under terms like 'impact enhancement' or 'fire optimization' or sth like that. These maniacs are jazzed by nature ! #ParkLandStudentsSpeak

1536 2018-02-21 19:01:55 I just saw a video about bump stocks and it actually pretty amazing how it works.
1537 2018-02-21 19:01:41 Curious... 1) before a few months ago... how many people had even heard of bump-stocks... 2) how did those things ever become legal... they scream - "these are bad news and should be illegal for the same reasons machine guns are illegal"... what the hell... no one needs 'em...

1545 2018-02-21 18:59:52 Even the Vegas shooter did not have one. He relied on a loophole with bump stocks and special modifications. Which have wide support from even conservatives on eliminating (since it's a loophole to current law, and not additional restrictions)
1546 2018-02-21 18:59:47 Totally agree. GOP and NRA throwing us a bone. You would have a hard time finding someone who believes bump stocks should be legal.
1547 2018-02-21 18:59:32 This is Trump's biggest problem.
His belief that libs can love him.
They hate him, deeply. It will never end, ever.
For that reason, "giving" them bump stocks, or anything else, is insane.
Further, the Vegas shooter is a lie.
A 60+ yr old man cant shoot 58 people w/a bump stock.

1561 2018-02-21 18:56:38 Trump’s directive to ban bump stocks is probably, in his mind, a minor/strategic concession to quiet critics.But it’s dumb.
-Ineffective (3DPrinting/innovation)
-Rationale for ban collides w cons’ 2ndA arguments
-How many mass shootings have they been used in? 1?
-Left won’t stop
1562 2018-02-21 18:56:34 3 weeks ago Denver enacted a ordinance banning bump stocks, as of today not one bump stock has been turned into the Denver PD
1563 2018-02-21 18:56:30 @kwelkernbc seriously. Just because reality tv president puts on a somber face and tone to talk about bump stocks in order to deflect you take the bait ?
1564 2018-02-21 18:56:28 While speaking about 'bump stocks', Trump appeared like one heavily sedated on powerful antipsychotics. 
'Commander in Chief' or psychotic 'Kommandant' pyschopath of "what the he'll is going on" taken WH by a covert coup guised as overt populism.
On scale of 100 grade is -100

1566 2018-02-21 18:55:32 Banning bump stocks do not stop military capability  guns from slautertering many. AR-15 need to be banned!  PERIOD.
1567 2018-02-21 18:55:23 Trump's banning bump stocks, I expect outrage from the same people who have spent 30 years saying Hillary Clinton will take our guns away from the kings of consistency known as the Republican Party

1568 2018-02-21 18:55:19 Come on Steve, which alien has entered your body? How did stocks do in the 70s when the dollar declined? Furthermore, the dollar rebounded smartly amid irrelevant QE.  Don't go monetarist on me.  Money supply is such a waste of time.
1569 2018-02-21 18:55:19 Grow up. Your team colluded you”didn’t know”. Putin got your job for you. Get the bump stocks banned, purchase age to 21, support Medicaid mental health coverage and then just go golf while Mueller  gets his ducks in line

1575 2018-02-21 18:54:19 A lot of proof out there the prick paid off everyone or haven't you heard! Why was Obama trying to take all our guns except bump stocks., and then the Las Vegas shooter, it doesn't take a brain surgeon
1576 2018-02-21 18:54:11 Gun reform is: No weapons in the hands of the mentally ill. No assault weapons sold. No bump stocks. Strict background checks. Yup, sounds awful!
  Change is coming.
1577 2018-02-21 18:54:09 Deer NRA please agree to help the president get rid of the bump stocks. Please call for stricter background checks. & mental illness. People are talking gun owners. silent majority of those who support the NRA or getting a little Fed Up with these massive shootings.
1578 2018-02-21 18:53:56 Sell homes! BUY STOCKS!
1579 2018-02-21 18:53:42 And I know people who go to the range with bump stocks weekly to shoot, yet have never fired them at anything other than metal or paper targets down range. For hours at a time. No one dies! Your point is completely invalid here!
1580 2018-02-21 18:53:40 Banning bump stocks because someone used an AR15 without one is as effective as banning chrome bumpers because someone drove a car into a crowd. 

Why not harden schools with armed security? Oh I know because it would work and destroy the narrative.
1581 2018-02-21 18:53:35 It's a start.  Bump stocks however aren't the primary problem.  Assault-like weapons, ammo, accessories & lacks laws are.

They use them as weapons against Dems to get what they want
When nothing else works
1587 2018-02-21 18:52:36 The young people from Parkland & across the Nation are forcing a conversation about gun control & help enact measures such as a reinstatement of Brady bill, raising ownership age to 21, ending bump stocks & other common sense measure we already have consensus on. #guns #Parkland
1588 2018-02-21 18:52:18 democrats don't care about bump fire stocks , the stock is just a step to banning the whole fire arm . The Modern Sporting Rifle . Let's call it what it is !
1589 2018-02-21 18:52:17 Not likely to prevent it when there are already 5-10 million in circulation in the US. When further sales were banned from 1994 to 2004, the ones currently owned were not changed. And bump stocks and other modifications  were allowed to be used.
1590 2018-02-21 18:52:15 And bump stocks is a start but the difference between semi automatic and automatic settings on many rifles has more to do with the jerk of ones finger rather than any aspect of the weapon itself (meaning it’s rather negligible).
1591 2018-02-21 18:52:07 When the fork hits your wallet, this could be considered an income event. Seems more like a spinoff and I'm not sure how that gets treated with stocks. Point is we don't know.
1592 2018-02-21 18:51:57 It is sickening that it takes 17 children dying for @POTUS to look at bump stocks used to massacre 58 in Vegas 4 months ago. Get right on these issues America. #NeverAgain
1593 2018-02-21 18:51:44 Bump stocks are a means to make an automatic weapon out of a semi-automatic one, heavily decreasing its accuracy in the process, leading to more stray bullets.

If you use a bump stock, your goal isn't to kill someone in self-defense, but to kill as many as possible.

IMHO, good.

1597 2018-02-21 18:51:13 Bump stocks are the shiny keys#davidhogg
1598 2018-02-21 18:51:12 Trading Dreamers for a Racist Wall is a false offer. Bump Stocks is a token nothing burger. He's not proposing 'Stronger' background checks. He's proposing FINALLY fully enforcing the EXISTING background check system. Of course #Trumpflakes fall for it all as real change.
1599 2018-02-21 18:51:09 Ban Assault Weapons!  Do not let the NRA and it's stooges talk this movement down to merely "bump stocks" and "background checks".  

It is time to act!  It's time to make real change!

Ban Assault Weapons.  

 #ParklandStudentsSpeak
1600 2018-02-21 18:51:05 Frankly I don't care about bump stocks, as they turn rifle accuracy to .  If accurate fire doesn't matter, use a shotgun.
1601 2018-02-21 18:51:00 The Second Amendment is not a license to slaughter. It gives us the right to self-defense. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and other military-like weapons.

#NeverAgain
1602 2018-02-21 18:50:57 Not just bump stocks Donald. All assault weapons. Private citizens do not need them. They think they need cannons and hand grenades also. Get a damn shotgun. It is your best in home protection. An assault weapon could kill a neighbor several blocks away.
1603 2018-02-21 18:50:56 Bump-stocks transform AR15s from semi- to fully automatic rifles. Slide Fire, the manufacturer of the bump-stock, said it "sprays [bullets] like a fire hose." Look it up -- and you can feel free to stop lecturing us about automatic rifles being illegal.
1604 2018-02-21 18:50:48 Even taking it at face value, banning bump stocks is useless when the same effect can be achieved with a plain old rubber band.  There's a YouTube video showing exactly that:  m5XzQ1BS7gU
Watch with school kids in mind on the other side, and there's no way not to be horrified.
1605 2018-02-21 18:50:43 Ok Hft are having fun trying to see if your work is true LOL bull flg is the set 273.50 is the 20 dma we push by shorts will run $SPY #Trade #stocks #investing
1606 2018-02-21 18:50:41 @realDonaldTrump fixes:  Require 3rd level permitting for bump stocks.  Do not allow military  .223 ammo.  Reduce power of ammo without special permitting.  Require higher level investigations for repepeat police visits, FBI contacts or similar even in absence of committed crime.
1607 2018-02-21 18:50:20 i want post malone tickets :(
1608 2018-02-21 18:50:09 45 is definitely doing this symbolically. The only way to permanently ban bump stocks is to introduce legislation and pass it through both houses of Congress. Telling Sessions to ban bump stocks is useless theater.
1609 2018-02-21 18:49:53 Bump stocks should be illegal as it essentially constitutes a fully automatic firing rate.  The bill needs a clear language that doesn't unintentionally include match grade triggers that don’t increase the rate of fire.
1610 2018-02-21 18:49:46 True, very true. I'm sure all of those responsible gun owners will be largely unaffected by reasonable legislation requiring background checks and banning the most dangerous aspects like bump stocks.
1611 2018-02-21 18:49:22 @SheryAhnNews @JChatterleyBBG It's important to note the president wants to ban all devices that convert a weapon to fully automatic fire.  Bump stocks are only 1 device.  Other devices exist.  Owning an unlicensed fully auto gun is a federal crime.  Must include conversion kits
1612 2018-02-21 18:49:22 Nowhere NEAR enough, @JeffFlake. But it’s a start. Ban bump stocks. Ban unfettered sale of assault weapons. Extend background checks....like you do with abortion (a constitutional right also).
1613 2018-02-21 18:49:20 Stop lying. No one wants to take guns from law-abiding citizens. Poll after poll after poll shows the majority of Americans- including gun owners- want common-sense restrictions

No bump-stocks

Longer wait period

Mental health check

Close gun show loophole 

Etc
1614 2018-02-21 18:49:08 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You won't get away w/your meaningless PR memo on bump stocks. #Parkland shooter didn't have them. #WeCallBS
1615 2018-02-21 18:48:57 No, the government declared a war on fat to get rid of obesity. Because, as was thought back then, fat makes you fat.

We didn't regulate spoons, we regulated fat.

We're not interested in banning gun stocks, we're interested in regulating guns.
1616 2018-02-21 18:48:28 Dead ass wanna get up in these stocks, currency.. allat
1617 2018-02-21 18:48:24 Why are these states so racist they must make themselves international laughing stocks just to assert their prejudice??

I mean good for him that he makes money from picking out the best stocks in precious metals but goddamn...
1619 2018-02-21 18:47:32 NRA is more important than a child's life. The Kids and their parents do not donate enough to their campaigns. America needs a popular democracy. Trump is even attempting to ban bump stocks to appease so he does not have to regulate firearms.
1620 2018-02-21 18:47:21 I hold the RNC & R Party equally culpable in these tragedies NRA gave Djt campaign 30 mil $$. Gave Ryan 3 mil. & its a looong list. What’s their answer? We’ll try to take up a conversation banning “ bump stocks”. Total cop out & totally inadequate !

1625 2018-02-21 18:46:54 Generally stocks go up not down upon a takeover offer. This is an exception due to poorness of offer and $RAD being such poor operator of its business.  See $NXPI for example among others.

1627 2018-02-21 18:46:50 And if you remember, the NRA actually supported a ban on bump stocks after Las Vegas.  Throwing crumbs to buy silence.  Plus bump stocks are cheap - manufacturers not big source of NRA revenue
1628 2018-02-21 18:46:35 Global stocks are going higher because of frothiness and withdrawal of QE by Central Banks and soon they will realise dollar which is massively overvalued  as US debt and deficits are high will betray them leading to collspse

1630 2018-02-21 18:46:09 Yes, you will but I bet they take away bump stocks and the little things from this generation. It is the next generation that will be brainwashed enough to think it would be the right thing to do to give up guns.
1631 2018-02-21 18:46:02 not just anything, I think we want Background checks for all, mental health screenings, banning AR-15's and large capacity ammo. bump stocks...
1632 2018-02-21 18:45:57 I don't think he will, Bump Stocks we can do w/o. FBI Investigation needed, get rid of no gun zone in schools, let some school facility & teachers carry. GET FBI, LOCAL POLICE to  collaborate with each other, to stop mentally ill. Better background cks
1633 2018-02-21 18:45:55 Ahw, i just bought pitchfork stocks
1634 2018-02-21 18:45:33 Its shaky because da economy IS on up swing!It's natural n healthy quite honestly.If it just shoots straight up n follows da economy on same path it could set lot of 401k's up 4 huge loss if it crashes.BASICALLY IT SHOULD GO UP AND DOWN BUT MOSTLY UP.With Stocks steady wins race.
1635 2018-02-21 18:45:32 Partly yes by centralizing stocks, allowing retail investors to buy companies they may not have otherwise purchased. Centralizing always increases systemic risk. Even so, that was then. Today's ETFs backed by futures will become a problem. And then there's rehypothecation.
1636 2018-02-21 18:45:32 Thanks Joseph, how can anyone stand to tote around their mugs and have their photos made at such a place, let alone have any stocks in that company.........or furthermore drink and promote their coffee.......they do not have the only coffee in the world......I run from them.....
1637 2018-02-21 18:44:41 How we the people are tired of your advertising this BS. Concentrate on banning AR-15s and mega magazines,bump stocks and raising the age to 21 to own a gun. Call back  reciprocity bill. Most people don’t know about it and that it allows machine guns.#MomsDemandAction
1638 2018-02-21 18:44:25 No kidding - and things like 'bump stocks' are more like toys than anything.
1639 2018-02-21 18:44:18 They certainly going to get away with offering up bump stocks as a solution! NRA and those taking the blood@money gig is up finally!
1640 2018-02-21 18:44:15 This may be the ONE. Look how many deaths it took.  To hear politicians say they are willing to have "conversation" just isn't enough.  Getting rid of bump stocks isn't enough.  We don't NEED these types of weapons. True hunters don't need these weapons.  #ParklandStudentsSpeak

1642 2018-02-21 18:43:54 Banning bump stocks and adding more gun control is not going to fix this problem! We need more protection more police in gun free zones!
1643 2018-02-21 18:43:50 We can't accept Trump's little gesture and be satisfied that it's enough. It's too little too late. We need complete #GunReformNow. Banning bump stocks is not enough. Extensive background checks and banning assault rifles would be a nice start.
1644 2018-02-21 18:43:23 #stocks Assuming all dividends reinvested, money put in the DOW 30 in Feb.1998 today would have earned you a 5.97% return on dividends and your total investment a 219% return. This beats Treasury returns and the total investment results for the S&P 500 which came in at 154.869%
1645 2018-02-21 18:43:22 And now that bump stocks are illegal, there should be no more mass shootings with them right? Cause thats what you are saying about banning the single shot ar 15s.
1646 2018-02-21 18:43:18 Every GOP member of Congress has no doubt been given talking points by the NRA. When shootings like this happen, the NRA goes quiet, so then their puppets take up the slack. BTW, AZ just voted to not even DISCUSS banning bump stocks. #bloodmoney
1647 2018-02-21 18:43:15 Getting rid of bump stocks? That's the republican grand solution to the gun proliferation and gun violence problem in America? I didn't think they were serious.
1648 2018-02-21 18:43:07 @WilkowMajority MR Wilkow,  I wanted to get your thoughts on reports that President Trump has proposed a ban on bump stocks.  I am not a gun owner (But want to be), so I'm not sure what they are and what they do.  Gun Owners of America is opposed to it
1649 2018-02-21 18:42:58 Banning bump stocks, isn't the agenda. Stopping dangerously criminally violent young men from getting WMDs like an AR15 is.
Do something "real" .@realdonaldtrump
1650 2018-02-21 18:42:53 @POTUS MR president the libs are going to trick you on this bump stock business 
The wording is wrong 
You want to ban bump stocks fine but it should say bump stocks only anything other than that myself and millions of others can not and will not  support

1653 2018-02-21 18:41:57 I just divested myself of all gun stocks. Fidelity was listed as supporting gun stocks on several sites. They gave me a lame answer.  Something like no control over “indexed funds“ & “Figure it out yourself”. Gun stocks were there, hidden, & now gone because I sold them yesterday
1654 2018-02-21 18:41:54 @piersmorgan Congratulations on the decision to ban bump stocks. In my opinion, this decision was entirely down to your lobbying. Well done.
1655 2018-02-21 18:41:53 I cannot believe you turn your back on gun owners Trump you will not be getting reelected you're just like every other turncoat politician I was one of your biggest supporters but I cannot believe that you are trying to ban bump fire stocks the Second Amendment means nothing to u

1657 2018-02-21 18:41:24 Why is it that bubble in few tech stocks is treated as prosperity for entire USA and bond yields are rising not because of growth but due to selling of bonds by treasuries and fed and media is telling lies that it growth
1658 2018-02-21 18:41:15 what are bump stocks?
1659 2018-02-21 18:41:13 I have at least one argument in favor of devices that make a firearm easier to fire multiple times quickly. What about people with disabilities that make it hard for them to do so otherwise? Does banning of bump stocks or similar devices violate the ADA?
1660 2018-02-21 18:41:11 Thanks for the good Q, Nicholas. I assume you are referring to the general market, not $ANET alone. For now, low volume on up days does not negate 2/14 follow-through. Higher trade on significant down days would concern me! #stocks
1661 2018-02-21 18:41:03 It’s misguided emotion & used to push agendas. Trump & the NRA are saying ban bump stocks, & raise the ownership age. They’ll likely expand the mental health background checks too. Things the right probably disagree with. Call it down the middle Ahmed. #ParklandStudentsSpeak
1662 2018-02-21 18:40:52 Times up NRA. You are complicit in everyone of these mass shootings. You have bought politicians and you have allowed AR-15, bump stocks, etc to be purchased and used on kids.

1670 2018-02-21 18:39:43 When we stray away from the constitution, which was intended to defend us against enemies foreign AND domestic (tyranny), we will inevitably find that the emotional arguments won’t end with stocks or magazines, but with total restriction.
1671 2018-02-21 18:39:12 Invest in quality stocks
1672 2018-02-21 18:38:17 Mr. Trump's call for banning bump stocks is a ploy to make it appear he is taking action on gun control, without controlling guns or offending the NRA. Are you seriously concerned, Mr. Trump? Then call for a ban of the AR-15 and similar weapons. Future victims are waiting.
1673 2018-02-21 18:38:14 $CNDT one of the better looking charts out there, didnt pullback to give us an entry, watching a wide range of stocks this afternoon and waiting for a signal, might be a slower afternoon if volume doesn't pick up out there.
1674 2018-02-21 18:38:11 @realDonaldTrump If you do feel the need to ban bump stocks or raise the age limit to 21, please remember your promise to eliminate TWO regulations for every one enacted.  Thank you for all you do.
1675 2018-02-21 18:37:45 BS - all he did was say he wants to ban Bump Stocks - that's nothing, a drop in the bucket.  He's just saying anything because the pressure is on, and he has to respond with something.  I think all anyone wants is for "sensible" gun legislation, not ban all.

1677 2018-02-21 18:37:39 Today Obama seems to have pushed out Trump from my stocks, so Trump went to my crypto portfolio and has started wreaking havoc there.
1678 2018-02-21 18:37:29 Which I don’t necessarily disagree with, but definitely will point out that the NRA has skewed this beyond control to justify hardware like bump stocks, AR-15s. But this has now opened the door to that one guy who fears losing his life in an zombie apocalypse, to want them.
1679 2018-02-21 18:36:52 There is no way Apple is in talks to buy commodities. Someone is planting this in order to sell cobalt stocks.
1680 2018-02-21 18:36:48 A man in Las Vegas killed over 50 people and wounded another 500+ in 9 minutes with semi-auto rifles some with bump stocks.  Your point is completely invalid here.

1684 2018-02-21 18:35:29 Bump stocks=illegal. Limit size of magazines. Extensive background checks. Safety training and testing. Military style weapons=illegal. Waiting period to purchase.

And your 2nd question? If that's your point, why do we have any laws?
1685 2018-02-21 18:34:39 Big fucking deal, ban bump stocks, but leave semi auto AR-15, AK's & others on the market.That just don't do it for me

Passing a ban on bump stocks is a start, but clearly not enough. Nearly 70% of Americans want a ban on all assault weapons. #GunReformNow
1688 2018-02-21 18:34:21 *5 weeks later* 

In an important piece of investigative reporting, we found that bump stocks are, in fact, even more widely available now than before shit for brains @realDonaldTrump “banned” them.
1689 2018-02-21 18:34:19 Banning Bump Stocks is a start but it wont solve the gun issue. It’s a weak loss ass response by Trump. #StandUp
1690 2018-02-21 18:34:16 They said they'd consider banning bump stocks, is that the word? I don't know about them. People who do say it makes it hard to aim.
1691 2018-02-21 18:34:05 This is ridiculous! Who gives a  about bump stocks!
BAN SEMI AUTO LONG GUNS
1692 2018-02-21 18:34:03 Only cowardly bullies carry knives, take away the knife and they are nothing but snivelling worthless pieces of bile. Bring back the stocks and publicly humiliate these worthless souls.
1693 2018-02-21 18:33:45 Exactly. That is the biggest bullshit action anyone can take. You wouldn’t need to ban bump stocks if there weren’t any semi automatic assault weapons in the public realm.
1694 2018-02-21 18:33:37 Strengthening background checks? Okay. A ban on bump stocks and the like? Absolutely not. One term if that goes through.
1695 2018-02-21 18:33:29 More GOP window dressing. Anything short of re-instituting the assault weapons ban, outlawing bump stocks and tightening background checks would be cosmetic.
1696 2018-02-21 18:33:29 Kudos to President Trump for taking a stand on strengthening background checks and banning accessories like bump stocks. Yep. I said it. Credit where credit is due. Let's hope he holds firm.

1700 2018-02-21 18:32:33 What Trump is doing right now it's exactly what Obama wanted to do remember what the bump stocks in the stiffer background checks and all this other stuff and granted Obama did do some of it but Trump's attacking the 2nd Amend which he promised he would not do when he was running

1704 2018-02-21 18:31:27 Considering the US already had a successful assault weapons ban, that over 90% of Americans want background checks for buyers, that bump stocks can be eliminated, etc. it borders on criminal to make dumb, distracting statements when we can be enacting sensible legislation today.
1705 2018-02-21 18:31:18 I hope you are feel strongly enough and are impressed enough with them to actually do something about it. We need universal background checks and need to ban the AR-15 and all similar weapons, high capacity mags, and bump stocks.
1706 2018-02-21 18:31:18 I’m against banning the gun, but am pro a 30 day hold or something that prevents someone from buying a gun just to do these atrocities and I don’t see the need for bump stocks anymore... I don’t want to be afraid sending my child to school anymore!
1707 2018-02-21 18:31:18 And banning bump stocks will not solve anything. The Ar-15can fire off single shots almost as fast as an automatic weapon. It depends upon the dexterity of the shooter
1708 2018-02-21 18:31:03 Hey Twitter. Thanks for screwing the conservatives & Trump Supporters last night during your "purge ". Time to sell ALL shares you have in Twitter stocks. We won't forgive. We won't forget!  #MAGA
1709 2018-02-21 18:30:56 Seems like a good day to buy stocks in sex doll manufacturing. All those lonely right-wingers will need new robot friends.
1710 2018-02-21 18:30:40 I will agree with you on that. But restricting access to AK-15s other than law enforcement  is one way to stop the ease of killing. Also banning bump stocks, and universal background checks. It's a start.
1711 2018-02-21 18:30:38 So are bump stocks ban. only congress can write laws
1712 2018-02-21 18:30:38 In addition to President Trump requesting the Department of Justice propose a ban on bump stocks, I am requesting the president call for a congressional investigation into the FBI's mishandling of Nikolas Cruz & Devin Kelley.
1713 2018-02-21 18:30:33 That’s my thoughts
1714 2018-02-21 18:30:20 I hope they challenge your ban on bump stocks. That would be unconstitutional too.
1715 2018-02-21 18:30:19 All they have to do is reclassify semi-auto weapons with bump stocks as auto, and bingo, no more legal problems
1716 2018-02-21 18:30:18 proof is in the pudding. he says a lot of things that aren't true. he lies and can't be trusted on any level. If this goes through, great. but we need a lot more legislation than just bump stocks. he won't do that. he's incapable of doing that because the nra pays him.
1717 2018-02-21 18:30:08 Hey Trump why didn’t you call for a ban on bump stocks 4 months ago? Trying to make it look like you are doing something. You are a poor excuse for a “President.” Can’t wait for the “SWAMP” to be drained!
1718 2018-02-21 18:29:39 Not how bump stocks work gun noob
1719 2018-02-21 18:28:58 rand back on the saddle...11.63 to the USD 16.3 to pound...financials ..banks..insurers all likely to benefit. I wish I could add property stocks..but Rivonia crowd had to spoil it!!!
1720 2018-02-21 18:28:57 He didnt stop it did he? He knew it was becoming law didnt he? It became law under him right? Why didnt he just use his executive order to make them illegal right away? FU Snowflake - you cant have it both ways. Obummer did nothing to prevent bump stocks from being legal!!!
1721 2018-02-21 18:28:39 2010 govt ruled bump stocks not subject to regulation. Than u Obama  @joncoopertweets
1722 2018-02-21 18:28:29 Banning bump stocks will do nothing to ameliorate the situation. Banning AR-15s is a good start.
1723 2018-02-21 18:28:14 I applaud the fact teens are actually taking a stand for anything , Im sorry for your loss but do you honestly think criminals are going to give up THEIR weapons? The 2nd will always be no matter what .POTUS has already banned bump stocks, working on raising the age to 21 to buy
1724 2018-02-21 18:27:54 Stephen Paddock murders 58 people in Vegas with the aid of bump stocks. Trump does nothing. Nikolas Cruz murders 17 people in Florida, without bump stocks. But, suddenly Trump signs a memo ordering regulations on bump stocks.
1725 2018-02-21 18:27:51 @BoSnerdley Rush needs to study up on how bump stocks work! Also, full auto guns are *very* costly (as in 10's of $K's each)- they are used for fun and as status symbols.
1726 2018-02-21 18:27:25 If a certain brand named can of bean were deemed poisonous, they would be taken off the shelves immediately.  So why weren't bump stocks taken off the shelf...they both are a danger to your health.
1727 2018-02-21 18:27:16 Just talked to a gun lover about the usefulness of bump stocks.
He said it doesn't matter the usefulness, they are protected by the 2nd A
and that will be the slippery slope to further gun bans (semi-autos)
I personally can live without them ...
1728 2018-02-21 18:26:47 Particularly "Credit check organization" of gov jurisdiction.
Financial credit investigation & Other various inspection agencies. 
Also it included the stocks and the company registration, too.
All inspection and accreditation organizations involved in "credit" were targeted.
1729 2018-02-21 18:26:40 What's funnier than the stupid republican conservative establishment thinking they're doing FUCKING ANYTHING by banning "bump stocks" because of the scary prospect of the "rate of fire" being too great as if you could go on the ban effective trigger finger discipline! FUCKING WOW

1731 2018-02-21 18:26:27 Rush :Setting age limits on 1A rights banning bump stocks is slippery slope Progressives won’t be satisfied no matter what They’ll continue to push for more restrictions until they get the guns
1732 2018-02-21 18:26:25 And that the @NRA is using to distract. They're saying 'sure! Ban bump stocks!' Meanwhile they're fighting every bit of common sense legislation out there whilst driving a divisive narrative.
1733 2018-02-21 18:26:22 Then why is he focusing on bump stocks used once in LV and NOT on AR-15s used in most of the other mass shootings, think Sandy Hook, Parkland, Columbine, Aurora, Orlando to name a few?
1734 2018-02-21 18:26:16 If anyone thinks that banning bump stocks and AR-15 will prevent future mass shootings are idiots. First of all a "determined" mass shooter will just get these things in the black market. Besides, the VA Tech shooter used a handgun to kill 32 people on campus.
1735 2018-02-21 18:26:15 @davidhogg111 Give the NRA Hell tonight!!! They've done way more than just deserve it. Check with Emma what I sent her about bump stocks (and why that's a throwaway for the NRA). David in Toronto.
1736 2018-02-21 18:26:11 Enough gun aficionados have blithely encouraged banning bump stocks to make me fairly sure it's a meaningless gesture.
1737 2018-02-21 18:26:10 Not enough. What the country wants is no automatic rifles or pistols, no high velocity ammunition, no bump stocks, and no silencers in the hands of any civilian or police officers. We want the killing to stop. Simple. Show our children we care.
1738 2018-02-21 18:26:04 I'm not sure I'd get too excited about him giving in on an item that roughly no one knew existed before Vegas. Bump stocks should have been class III from day one.
1739 2018-02-21 18:25:52 Affects your stock to a variable degree because:
a) Lack investor voting rights (reducing value)
b) Indexes won't cover stocks that lack certain rights so you miss out on passive investment (which again, reduces value)
c) Lack of investor protection which increases volatility
1740 2018-02-21 18:25:49 So sad. Does anyone know how many innocent people are killed by porno every day. Thousands!! Just ask the National Pornography Association. We must out an end to the sale of Butt stocks. They’re so dangerous.
1741 2018-02-21 18:25:48 @DocLiza1 FYI #POTUSTrump is going to pass law to BAN Bump stocks, Raise the age to buy a gun. Sorry this happened to Children, I'm just as Devastated as a mother. 

But that said, I believe in the #2ndAmendment bc you Never know if You'll need to Protect yourself and Family.
1742 2018-02-21 18:25:34 You changed the mental health law with buying guns now you say better background checks!  Get your head out of your ass and do something real to protect Americans make it illegal to sell or buy semi automatic weapons and bump stocks!
1743 2018-02-21 18:25:29 Won't go center but will offer something, maybe including GVROs, age limits, bump stocks... May not be a lot, but is a departure from previous Repub Just Say No on control.
1744 2018-02-21 18:24:58 Why don't you award the survivors of the Florida mass shootings with real solutions. How about a ban on assault weapons, strict background checks and a buy back program for all current owners who wish to get rid of bump stocks and assault weapons.

1750 2018-02-21 18:23:54 He's all down for a band-aid fix, the NRA gives no shits about bump stocks so they allow the gesture. It's not enough, not even close.
1751 2018-02-21 18:23:36 I still don't understand the whole banning of bump stocks... How would this prevents anything?

1757 2018-02-21 18:22:12 As usual he is a day late and a buck short.    Bump stocks were the issue after Vegas, which was the last major slaughter.    -They should not only be banned, the people that sold them to Paddock should be charged as accessories to murder.

1762 2018-02-21 18:21:29 They already do the background checks, and you wait a period of time unless you have a CCW and then YOU've already been checked. NRA wanted restrictions on "bump stocks", didn't pass.  The LAWS on the books need upheld. And armed guards at school is a must.

1765 2018-02-21 18:20:36 It would be something, which when it comes to something as dangerous as bump stocks, is a Hell of a lot better than nothing.
1766 2018-02-21 18:20:29 There was an outcry after Vegas to ban bump stocks, but Trump did nothing. In fact he wouldn't even talk about any gun control. Obama looked at bump stocks, but was unable to ban them, because they didn't fit the criteria needed to ban them.

1769 2018-02-21 18:19:55 The wall WILL stop Mexicans from coming into the U.S. illegally, then. How do you label common sense with something that has never been tested or done?  It’s “common sense and logic” that kids shouldn’t have access to bump stocks, automatics and weapon grade artillery.

- outlawing AR-15’s, Bump stocks, and any rapid fire weapon. 
- No ammo clips over 10 bullets
- no gun sales to mentally ill.
- background checks to include domestic violence.
- quit doing the bidding of Russia, the NRA

1775 2018-02-21 18:18:41 .@realDonaldTrump has prided himself, patted himself on the back & gloated immensely about his highly-publicized reversal of "Obama's" executive orders." Now Mr. POTUS, do the same by issuing an EO to ban gun bump stocks. I'm waiting, to see your Cheshire cat grin and thumbs up.
1776 2018-02-21 18:18:34 Yeah, idiot, “no reason”.  Previous assault rifle ban had NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER (stats), Obama and DNC did jack-sh|t for gun control AND immigration, Trump is banning bump stocks, improving background checks, and possibly increasing the age to buy.  WHOM TO VOTE FOR?? 
1777 2018-02-21 18:18:30 I get your point mate and the Index works in similar ways..Likes of Neyney can be seen as Blue Chip stocks, i.e. we expect them to earn a high amount of dividends - high demand (MB or PB) - The current price of a future/stock is the discounted value of all its future returns
1778 2018-02-21 18:18:29 @realDonaldTrump THANK YOU 4 asking AG 2 ban bump stocks. WE NEED FEDERAL LAWS to have universal gun laws. 2A supporter, Trump supporter....
1779 2018-02-21 18:17:54 Wrong for the 3rd time. They don't make a bigger bang and can't change the quantity of the gunpowder. Bump stocks are a tool to use inertia to turn the movement of the recoil to reset the trigger finger into a squeezing position. Still one squeeze, one fire.
1780 2018-02-21 18:17:45 @realDonaldTrump Your directive to Sessions to ban anything which increases speed of firing shows ignorance & affects many guns not just bump stocks. This is a very anti-gun directive far exceeding what Obama &  Dems have tried for years.
1781 2018-02-21 18:17:36 Background checks and bump stocks.  You are one massacre behind.  Let's ban assault weapons.
1782 2018-02-21 18:16:21 Today it will be bump stocks, tomorrow it will be the whole damn gun!!!
1783 2018-02-21 18:16:18 "Common sense" gun laws mean a lot more to me than minimum basic.  To me, common sense means no assault weapons, no large ammo clips that permit rapid firing or quick firing of multiple rounds, no guns under 21, limits on hand guns, no bump stocks, training requirements, etc.
1784 2018-02-21 18:16:16 I’m a strong believer in 1A &2A- I’m also a survivor of horrific domestic violence that has been threatened by gun. That being said, common sense leads me to agree with banning bump stocks. It’s not a true ‘hunt for your family’ it’s an item to ‘hunt your family’ in wrong hands.

1788 2018-02-21 18:15:27 Trump's approval of stopping bump stocks is a good thing. But remember, they do not gain the gun manufacturers a penny. They are a separate industry not supported by the NRA.
1789 2018-02-21 18:14:51 @Emma4Change Have to do this in two parts.... I've covered this in detail before but just a reminder that banning "bump stocks" is a smokescreen for the NRA; they could care less. Much more popular and accurate are auto-tiggers, which do the same job as bump stocks only far more
1790 2018-02-21 18:14:13 Yep, we’ve been talking about a lot of Bre x like stocks out there right now
1791 2018-02-21 18:14:06 Li’l Paul will want a quid pro quo.  He’ll give bump stocks for Social Security.
1792 2018-02-21 18:14:04 Wouldn't you say every MOP has investments in stocks and shares though? Surely they are impacted by brexit also 1 way or another.
1793 2018-02-21 18:13:50 The reporting on this has been nothing short of awful. Trump never issued a "bump stock ban." He issued a memo instructing the DOJ to look at changes that may or may not have banned bump stocks, which may or may not have been implemented, at some indefinite point in the future.
1794 2018-02-21 18:13:47 @davidhogg111 I hear a lot of blame on @realDonaldTrump but do you remember when other mass shootings took place and Obama did nothing with full control senate and House. Trump is already putting legislation forward with the bump stocks.
1795 2018-02-21 18:13:45 Any noisy indicator is bullish for stocks
1796 2018-02-21 18:13:33 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks and other devices won't solve anything. What it will do is put people out of work for optics sake!

1801 2018-02-21 18:12:14 JFC no one has come with a solid explanation. It’s just we need more gun control. But what exactly? Trump just banned bump stocks and people attacked him for it. The left says let’s not make it political but my god

1810 2018-02-21 18:10:22 We actually have decent gun laws here in Hawaii. Check Wikipedia  under Hawaii Gun Laws. Banning bump stocks would make them even better. Thanks for not running away from the problem. We can all do much better. (peace, please)
1811 2018-02-21 18:10:04 outlawing "bump stocks" is not the answer. The answer is stop selling assault rifles, and PUT security back in the schools. ONE security officer can not do crap... in a school of over 3,000 students.
1812 2018-02-21 18:09:16 Did you see Trump came out and announced he directed the attorney general to begin the proposal to completely ban bump stocks and also spoke out to say we need to strengthen background checks? That’s factually more than what Obama did against Guns in 8 years
1813 2018-02-21 18:08:28 I feel these students are finally going to be the defining change for America who can make a difference. Whether that means strengthened background checks, a ban on assault rifles or bump stocks, the chances are stronger than ever to accomplish reform.

1818 2018-02-21 18:07:32 I have business ideas I want to pursue  , think I’m ready to start investing in things/ stocks
1819 2018-02-21 18:07:23 @realDonaldTrump it's the principal of the matter - dont give the anti-gunners what they want. Even banning bump stocks plays into their arguement that "guns are the problem and accountability for ones actions don't matter"
1820 2018-02-21 18:07:04 Obama's ATF approved bump stocks. Once they are available,  they are easily replicated with a 3D printer.
1821 2018-02-21 18:06:45 Heck, most folks I grew up with could take out 20 to 30 with a single action rifle before someone could stop them. It doesn't matter what guns you restrict. The fact that you mentioned bump stocks reveals your ignorance. Total non-issue.
1822 2018-02-21 18:06:12 Not a big lose. This will actually protect guns. Most AR’s can’t handle rapid fire. It ruins the gun. Not designed for it. Banning bump stocks will preserve the guns life only. #savetheguns
1823 2018-02-21 18:06:00 Bump stocks are novelty items at best, and I personally don’t consider them safe for shooters or anyone around them. Gun rights activists and the @NRA should just take this one on the chin and worry about more important matters. That’s probably what @realDonaldTrump is doing.

1825 2018-02-21 18:05:38 Call the White House at (202)-456-1111 today and tell President Trump that  he should oppose the expansion of federal background checks oppose the  ban on bump stocks and magazines and throw his support behind the  repeal of gun-free school zones instead if busy call 202-456-1414
1826 2018-02-21 18:05:34 Trump signed an order to ban bump stocks, which increase the firing rate of a gun. We've still have a long way to go but it's a start, at least.
1827 2018-02-21 18:05:02 There are multiple ways to leverage fundamental analysis. You could do it yourself, rely on a professional ananylsis, buy a mutual fund, or you could even randomly pick stocks to invest in. #ECO2307
1828 2018-02-21 18:04:40 @realDonaldTrump #neveragain So Donnie what are you gonna do about this? #NeverAgain Your weak attempt to ban bump stocks? To tighten something you reversed that a real President started? #NeverAgainTrump
1829 2018-02-21 18:04:27 It will not stop at bump stocks. Bump stocks do not kill people people with murder in their heart kill people. Knives kill people, cars kill people, trains kill people, what's next
1830 2018-02-21 18:04:21 I feel like banning the gun itself is obviously wrong but I’m perplexed why more conservatives/Republicans don’t rally around banning bump stocks and raising the ownership age. Hopefully it’ll catch on
1831 2018-02-21 18:04:16 Oh the irony. Obama's executive order for dreamers was good enough for you, no legislative action needed, but not Trump's executive order to ban bump stocks. Very interesting, Ms. Boxer, very interesting.

1834 2018-02-21 18:04:05 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if you want to totally ban bumpstocks be prepared to lose lots and lots of votes and support. Choose a happy medium that will satisfy everyone. Treat the bump stocks just like all full auto weapons. Anyone who wishes full auto must obtain a, cont.

1837 2018-02-21 18:03:34 @HeatherCarterAZ I am so disappointed in your refusal to discuss banning Bump Stocks, I expected more from you
1838 2018-02-21 18:03:16 @realDonaldTrump Do not ban Bump Stocks, rather make it a Class 3 license to get one, the same license needed to own fully automatic weapons.  The class 3 is expensive to get and a far tougher checks.
1839 2018-02-21 18:03:14 Not sure how restricting bump stocks is going to help save lives. Have y’all seen how creative prisoners are with little to nothing to work with? Creative minds can overcome the bump stock barrier...my hubby tells me it can be done with a belt loop.
1840 2018-02-21 18:02:56 Hadn't kept up with Canada's big seafood stocks (Highliner $HLF.TO and Clearwater $CLR.TO). Wow, glad I left them alone. I'll have to take another look, but with all the debt they might still be expensive

We must have a federal ban on assault weapons & bump stocks.

1843 2018-02-21 18:02:50 They are protected under the 2A and i doesn't matter if they are useful. Reguulations on bump stocks will in turn be used to ban all "rate increasing" devices until they eventually go after all semi auto weapons.

1846 2018-02-21 18:02:03 President Trump is moving to ban bump stocks. One democratic Senator says that this is a step in the right direction but could be tied up in court for years. #JOUR280

1848 2018-02-21 18:01:40 @realDonaldTrump Instead of urging bans on bump stocks why don’t you use an executive order? You seem to have been able to use it against Obama gun check regulations. What is stopping you now? You spineless worm
1849 2018-02-21 18:00:58 Are they going to outlaw belt loops on pants? The Bump-Stock is an offshoot of the bump fire technique. Sacrificing Bump-Stocks is okay by me. I have no use for one, but I really hate seeing people be misinformed about it.
1850 2018-02-21 18:00:46 Background checks and bump stocks. Do we accept a band-aid and leave assault weapons available for the masses to protect the domicile?
1851 2018-02-21 18:00:37 I am so proud of all of you standing for what is right. Some politicians are saying, per a pole taken by them, that gun violence is down because all has excess to guns. Whom did they poll?  AR15 should still be illegal and also the bump stocks. Stand your ground and God bless.
1852 2018-02-21 18:00:06 Hunters use semi-auto weapons because they are effective, none of them use bump stocks.
1853 2018-02-21 17:59:58 Stronger backround checks, raise the age, bump stocks, wtf does that have to do with mental illness, FBI not doing their jobs, attempt to disarm the people, get real and go after the real cause
1854 2018-02-21 17:59:57 Not particularly..TBH but that’s because I’m less a trader than an impatient LTBH, if something is a buy for me I tend to try & get filled regardless, on a lot of my smaller stocks it can be useful for timing top ups ..certainly enough to repay the cost many times over..i think
1855 2018-02-21 17:59:57 @NRA 
I believe in 2 ammendment 
I think it would be smart and wise to come out against public sale of AR15 and bump stocks
Please be wise in the tragedy, #NRA is mis understood and you need to fix that
1856 2018-02-21 17:59:30 This is the loveliest message  although the pedantic side of me thinks... a winning lottery ticket, stocks and shares 
1857 2018-02-21 17:58:53 @realDonaldTrump Please oppose the expansion of federal background checks … oppose the ban on bump stocks and magazines … and throw support behind the repeal of gun-free school zones instead. Support Americans that follow the law.

PARTIALLY RIGHT..
His had Bump Stocks on an AR-15 but...
The high-powered weapons also included a .308-caliber AR-10 rifle and an AK-47-type rifle — as well as four Daniel Defense DDM4 rifles, three FN-15s and other rifles made by Sig Sauer, according to reports.
1862 2018-02-21 17:57:32 The stocks suck
1863 2018-02-21 17:57:13 He could have come out against bump stocks when the NRA even said they would support it...but he didn't. Now that it's not an issue in the most recent mass shooting...now he's coming out? Too late @POTUS...again.

1866 2018-02-21 17:56:58 Ah the Facebook page of a local news station... The only place where a story about Trump wanting to ban bump stocks is met with the comment "OKAY THEN WHY DON'T WE TEST THE RAPE KITS?! END THE BACK LOG!"... I mean, I'm down with that, but what does it have to do with bump stocks?
1867 2018-02-21 17:56:53 How about this? Don’t waste time and money trying to take away guns. Just wont happen. Regulate the industry. 10 rnd or less mags, no collapsible stocks, outlaw binary triggers and bump stocks, just to name a few. Revamp the process it takes to get a gun. 7 day wait again

1877 2018-02-21 17:55:16 I had to wait 3 days to purchase a handgun. So I’m not opposed to others having to wait also. So I’m all for raising the age limit, possibly a 24-48 hr policy of a complete and thorough background check, and banning bump stocks.
1878 2018-02-21 17:55:14 murder illegal, drugs illegal, drunk driving illegal. These restrictions and laws only affect law abiding citizens. If some guy is going to shoot up a place, why would he care if bump stocks are illegal? Making something illegal does not eradicate it. So why capitulate?

1883 2018-02-21 17:54:13 Civil disagreement != intolerance, and yes Shapiro is making a statement. He has most definitely seen all permutations of gun control proposals. Just because he doesn’t think any are practical does not mean he’s right. Trump is now looking to ban bump stocks. That’s practical.

1898 2018-02-21 17:51:27 I hate to be the guy, but this will not be newsworthy in a week. The status quo has already begun, they'll ban the manufacturing of bump stocks. Nothing will happen with gun control and this will all be a waste. Another tragedy, but not the last.

1900 2018-02-21 17:51:20 No one cares about the definitional difference between semi automatic and automatic and no one cares about the mechanics of how bump stocks works. What people care about is that mass shootings stop. So cut the straw man stuff
1901 2018-02-21 17:51:14 No. You are wrong. White male USA citizens that are racists are the most dangerous terrorists. Read the numbers that the FBI keeps. Banning assault weapons worked before, it can work again. Banning bump stocks and large clips will help. Look at the stats for the banned years. Tx.

1908 2018-02-21 17:50:14 @realDonaldTrump HEY, There MISTER! Don't give the authority to ban bump stocks just to get people to think that you are doing something effective. Bump stocks do NOT turn a semi auto into a full auto weapon. YOUR job it to PROTECT the Constitution.

1920 2018-02-21 17:48:31 Even though many may have survived #LasVegasShooting, banning bump stocks is a crumb thrown in hopes of curtailing the national outrage about unfettered massacres--will it work? I hope not

It's other caring individuals who are giving to this important cause.Stop spreading lies.Things are changing.Get on board or get run over.Even Trump sees it and is asking for bump stocks to be outlawed and better background checks

1929 2018-02-21 17:46:20 Yes, says the guy that during the 2008 financial crisis, had Timmy Geithner and the government there to lend him an extra pair of swimming trunks and floaties for his bank stocks.
1930 2018-02-21 17:46:17 First bump stocks then a knock on the door asking for your weapons. This is how it starts.
1931 2018-02-21 17:45:51 If you think that Trump is not doing anything to change gun policy in this country understand that he is supporting legislature for tougher background checks and looking to ban bump stocks again. More reform is likely necessary but at least he is attempting some kind of reform.
1932 2018-02-21 17:45:39 If memory serves me well, Paul Ryan had never heard of Bump Stocks before Vegas.
1933 2018-02-21 17:45:15 Yesterday, they allowed cryptos to move higher while stocks went lower. So how does this correlation work?
1934 2018-02-21 17:45:13 notice,right now its a regulation change /eliminate only bump stocks as opposed to saying ," any device that increase firing rate to more than 4 shots per minute"

bumps are not the issue (only part)  the issue is the assault / fast firing large volume rifles fed by large clips
1935 2018-02-21 17:44:55 @NicolleDWallace @mitchellreports Nicolle is an incredible optimist when she thinks kids & parents can ask Trump for a fact driven debate on guns.

1936 2018-02-21 17:44:43 To nicole wallace on andrea mitchell.  Banning bump stocks is NOT a step in the right direction.  Banning bump stocks is a ploy to keep assault weapons on the street!  How many of the mass shootings in the last 20 years involved a bump stock? PLEASE!  "Ban bump stocks" =NRA!
1937 2018-02-21 17:44:39 It’s his token policy change. Banning bump stocks doesn’t affect the NRA so he can spew this BS and think he’s a hero. We know better. He’s owned by the Russian backed NRA.
1938 2018-02-21 17:44:35 #NeverAgain Trump proposes banning bump stocks. #Tokenism Get serious Trump.
1939 2018-02-21 17:44:22 Love ya man, but throw the crazies a bone with the bump stock BS.  So when they say "Trump didn't do anything!" he can say "Bump Stocks, Bitch".
1940 2018-02-21 17:43:55 $ANDI 0.0273 rebounding
1941 2018-02-21 17:43:53 No. Assault weapons are for hunting humans. Bump stocks and huge clips made the massacre at Las Vegas possible. Hunting and personal protection defensive weapons not taken. That is what most sane people want. Please read the history of gun control in Scotland and Australia.
1942 2018-02-21 17:43:04 But doesn't it matter that these bump stocks can alter a gun into a machine gun which IS illegal?  Do you own one?
1943 2018-02-21 17:43:00 We waited to talk about solutions after Las Vegas and the bums couldn't even pass a ban on bump stocks! WTF?
1944 2018-02-21 17:42:40 Huh! Trump is agreeing bump stocks should be banned! Finally a good decision!!
1945 2018-02-21 17:42:40 These kids hearts are in the right place but they're being financed heavily by the left who want to band all guns. As a vet, cop and NRA member I support stricter background checks and banding bump stocks. I do not support banding sales to over 21 for long guns.
1946 2018-02-21 17:41:47 London stocks reversed earlier losses to end Wednesday's session higher, helped along by well-received results from the likes of Lloyds and Glencore, as the pound slipped following an uptick in the UK unemployment rate.
1947 2018-02-21 17:40:45 @realDonaldTrump Now you want to do something about bumper stocks? You had your shot at that; you failed miserably. Now you want to use it as a bone? It's not going to work.
1948 2018-02-21 17:40:37 I think raising the age limit is a good idea. It seems young kids now are less mature than in generations past. They are "indoor cats".

We have to stop thinking ANY reasonable gun law is a straight shot to complete bans. The guys arguing FOR bump stocks are nuts, for example.
1949 2018-02-21 17:40:15 I own stocks in that company we are practically family
1950 2018-02-21 17:40:14 The NRA have authorised Trump to talk about banning bump stocks then, that’s not token at all
1951 2018-02-21 17:39:58 i call this weakness. third day in a row that a daily short is working. stocks are too easy
1952 2018-02-21 17:39:54 Their website is down supposedly due to high traffic. Isn’t it wonderful that they have bump stocks that make shooting safer?
1953 2018-02-21 17:39:53 Real requirements for friendship over here. I'm asking real questions...whats your debt to income ratio? Views on stocks, mutual funds, income property? Lol niggas really get blocked for not having the right answers over here
1954 2018-02-21 17:39:42 I'm not going to have an argument about whether "semi auto" is automatic, especially given that bump stocks are still on the market as we speak.
1955 2018-02-21 17:39:39 He just banned bump stocks. Which were made legal by Obama.  Let that sink in
1956 2018-02-21 17:39:22 @rainnwilson WHY don't non-Fox networks EVER seem to report when Pres. Trump does something positive? He placed a ban on bump stocks, yesterday. He's looking into age-limits for gun sales. NO CNN, MSNBC REPORT!!
1957 2018-02-21 17:39:22 We see through your terrified bs. And by the way, just bump stocks won’t stop us. #RussiaSanctions #NeverAgain #GunReformNow
1958 2018-02-21 17:39:21 So trump is trying to ban bump stocks lol smh
1959 2018-02-21 17:38:59 Guns are a simple thing to build. Making them illegal or bump stocks or anything WILL not work, you can just make one. Ever heard of a 3D printer??
1960 2018-02-21 17:38:53 He hasn't banned them. He has recommended banning bump stock (which turns guns into machine guns which r illegal anyway) but u still can have any guns like assault rifles. The florida shooter didn't use bump stocks. He also repealed Obamas gun regulations on mental illness checks
1961 2018-02-21 17:38:50 The stocks go up and their currency go down you would be lucky if you manage to break even when yiu get out.
1962 2018-02-21 17:38:49 Trump Jr has already attacked them as actors with an agenda (he retweeted) so yea, they have already started.  And Donald. Sr is recommending banning bump stocks (which were not even used) so they are doing something.
1963 2018-02-21 17:38:43 Fact: mass shootings are happening more often and taking more lives...instead of instituting much needed reform to background checks, ban bump stocks, etc.. @Jackkingston wants to ban violence...on tv He wants to curb make believe gun violence, instead of the real thing!

1965 2018-02-21 17:38:23 Sadly sales of bump stocks  rose. Announcement worked in favor of NRA. Epic fail.
1966 2018-02-21 17:38:21 Bump stocks alone don’t kill you and no it’s not “dramatic” read a real history book!
1967 2018-02-21 17:38:14 Don't get me wrong, bump stocks need to not be a thing... But let's also acknowledge how many tragedies #POTUS is behind on in actually taking action to prevent lost lives... Just a thought.

#GunContolNow
1968 2018-02-21 17:38:05 Gains in tech stocks, Amazon drive Wall Street higher: (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with technology shares and Amazon driving gains ahead of minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting.
1969 2018-02-21 17:38:02 He just issued a ban on bump stocks. Which by the way were made legal by Obama. So wth are you even talking about. #Factsmatter
1970 2018-02-21 17:38:01 @realDonaldTrump Do away with bump stocks, OK. BUT what is needed is to have mental ill persons reported to law enforcement & they DO THEIR JOBS. The school, students, sheriff office, FBI ALL Knew & did nothing. The gun is not to blame they are. WE HAVE ENOUGH GUN LAWS!!
1971 2018-02-21 17:37:18 Contrary to numerous press reports, Trump did *not* order DOJ to ban bump stocks yesterday -- his order amounted to nothing, but was widely misreported. I can explain. 1/
1972 2018-02-21 17:37:18 @AStramanak @cnnbrk @marcorubio @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Lorenzo Prado's account is why you DON'T arm teachers and have a tragic accident. 
Ban assult weapons, raise the minimum age to purchase, deeper background checks, Ban bump stocks, longer wait period #EnoughIsEnough
1973 2018-02-21 17:37:03 It does very much feel this way. 

But I polled 30 Financial Advisors last week, and the vast majority were convinced that stocks are headed lower.  So my bias is that the pain trade is still higher. 

#bullish
1974 2018-02-21 17:37:00 That's a long stretch from not wanting to die on a hill for bump stocks. Might want to scale back the paranoia a bit. Or don't. Either way works for me.
1975 2018-02-21 17:36:54 Automatic assault weapons are already illegal and NRA and @realDonaldTrump both support banning bump stocks. If FBI had done it's job, gun laws wld have prevented this shooting. It's not a lack of laws...It's incompetence.
1976 2018-02-21 17:36:47 Feel ko konti lang stocks? Hahahaha kasi pag pupunta ako doon laging out of stock daw yung mga hinahanap ko 
1977 2018-02-21 17:36:46 @realDonaldTrump @ChiefJohnKelly what threat bump stocks requires POTUS attention? Clear USA of enemies within & fill GTMO 45sqmi to max. Fanning flames  false reasoning doesn't help MAGA. Gun control is ppl control not criminal control, not mentally-ill control, not CIA control
1978 2018-02-21 17:36:05 @ScottWapnerCNBC  Just wanted you all to know. Bond buyers are no one we know, only ppl with 15 M in bank are buyers. Stock buyer's generally don't care what Bond rates are, nor interest rates, we have plenty of money to buy stocks & have no debts. No ppl can live on 2.85% !
1979 2018-02-21 17:35:57 I can't believe POTUS is agreeing to outlaw bump stocks. That shooting in Vegas was a false flag. That hotel room was staged. Where's the video footage in the hallway? Why were all tech devices confiscated? Why was the spot light turned off the stage but turned 2 crowds?
1980 2018-02-21 17:35:48 Why is the right so opposed to *sensible* protections and "WELL" REGULATIONS? Even your potus is calling for end to bump stocks and better regulations of background checks.  EVEN him.

No amendment, none, not even the 1st is without immunity from regulations.
1981 2018-02-21 17:35:35 The only way this will change if people like you sale their stocks. Money talks. And won't buy them back until they stop censoring.
1982 2018-02-21 17:35:08 @realDonaldTrump. Highly disappointed regarding your decision on bump stocks....what's next? I voted for you to protect our rights. You have caved to the dark side..
1983 2018-02-21 17:35:05 People Stocks and Emotions

When People See Red On The Screen They Panic They Sell Sell Sell

When People have Drawdowns and Pullbacks in Real life they Panic and Worry 

They never look at it as a buying Opportunity or A Chance To become stronger in Life.

Stocks and Emotions
1984 2018-02-21 17:35:05 Stocks were down some weeks ago, but I didn’t fold...they back lit like a mug!! Issa great day indeed! #choosejoy
1985 2018-02-21 17:34:36 Well that's a tad dramatic, Aunt. Bump stocks =\= "guns"
1986 2018-02-21 17:34:20 This is why nobody takes you seriously they should bring back public stocks drag you out of your buildings and set you out for the public that the rotten fruit at for a week or so that'll stop lying reporters
1987 2018-02-21 17:34:17 Trump is encouraging congress to outlaw Bump stocks as that permits any rifle owner to turn their gun into a machine gun. Im betting they will ignore him because gun control can only come when we get a Democratic president yet Obama did not even propose it.
1988 2018-02-21 17:33:53 Wake up, open up CNN, find out porn is more dangerous than bump stocks and assault rifles to Congress... #ItsTheAmericanWay
1989 2018-02-21 17:33:50 Let them look those survivors in the eyes and explain why silencers, bump stocks, 30 round magazines, and arming children is more important than 17 lives.
1990 2018-02-21 17:33:14 Everyone thet habe FPC stocks lost the money! It's nothing lift to sale! And this is not the end! Q1 will be 100% profit warning! So if we are in 10kr think where we will come to.How much can we cry? What's left is to laugh at the stupidity of the company.
1991 2018-02-21 17:32:54 On Fox Biz News today @ 2pm. Tune in! Still working through the vestiges of the recent corrective process stocks underwent. Whether the low on Feb. 9 was the bottom may yet be known but equities are compelling regardless given the strong fundamental conditions.
1992 2018-02-21 17:32:33 Super .. It helps to have a conviction on our core stocks
1993 2018-02-21 17:32:11 thats why all stocks/crypto are measured by market cap. because it shows you the potential rather than the price of the company
1994 2018-02-21 17:31:56 Funny. My friend who is a die hard Trump supporter now supports Trump's ban of bump stocks. I swear to God he'd be pissed if Hillary was in office and did the same thing. Trump keeps gradually decreasing my approval of him.
1995 2018-02-21 17:31:51 More BS. Sessions had already filed intent to propose rules on bump stocks to the Federal Register in December. This was just grandstanding.
1996 2018-02-21 17:31:34 I'll be surprised if anything changes in gun laws. I think it's great to hear Trump wants bump stocks banned. I hope these kids don't walk away disappointed. Politicians need to remember these kids are close to voting age. It's still all about the money in the end.
1997 2018-02-21 17:31:16 Il faut enlever aussi les stocks, mais d'une année sur l'autre ca ne bouge pas trop. Bref, quelque soit les "besoins", dès lors que t extrais ton pétrole, tes merdouilles bitumineuses ton gaz et ton charbon, tu peux être sûr qu'il va terminer en CO2
1998 2018-02-21 17:31:09 MBS slip back into negative territory as Stocks add to gains. Dow +140 points.
1999 2018-02-21 17:30:56 Stocks open slightly higher, Dow +40 points.
2000 2018-02-21 17:30:55 Ban bump stocks and make background checks more in depth (if possible) 

There is no other gun laws to stop psychos from finding a way to hurt people (one of the last 5 shooters killed 32 people with HANDGUNS
2001 2018-02-21 17:30:38 Guns dont kill people - mentally sick people do! We need better mental health treatment in the US. By the way - remember it was Obummer who approved the sale of bump stocks!
2002 2018-02-21 17:30:12 Thanks - it's nice to get sensible answer from NRA member. We think bump stocks should have been banned straight after Vegas. The truth is you have a mountain to climb...

America is great in many ways - somehow you are going to have to be great at taking guns out of circulation.
2003 2018-02-21 17:29:48 @DickeyCollas relevant 2specify stats apply 2 ASSESSED stocks only...covering major commercial species but not full diversity of catch sp. 
Also, a stock can be defined on scientific criteria(e.g. genetics,ethology) OR practical/political choices(e.g. data availabity)
BR
2004 2018-02-21 17:29:44 Were bump stocks used in Florida?
2005 2018-02-21 17:29:18 and Obama signed legislation to legalize bump stocks!
2006 2018-02-21 17:29:14 $jor and $aaz seems to be moving today.  Both have lots of promise with their properties.  With the weather warming up, so will these two stocks.  (I hold both)
2007 2018-02-21 17:29:12 Maybe you need some direct US exposure? I added US stocks as part of my new year shake up, its been my saviour so far. 9 straight days meaningfully up due to US holdings.
2008 2018-02-21 17:29:04 Yes! My mum still stocks tins whenever there is a Labour Government.
2009 2018-02-21 17:29:04 OK let me rephrase it I’m sorry the word assault popped up there offending ur senses while mass murdering of our children does not ...A.R. 15‘s should be banned there is no reason for them there’s no reason for bump stocks there you go
2010 2018-02-21 17:29:03 Not rhetoric, just asking what Trump White House is doing about the problem. I cited whataboutism when there was an attempt to blame the problem on others. I think Trump's statement about bump stocks is a step in the right direction. Sorry you are low energy.
2011 2018-02-21 17:28:29 The rifles are banned. The equipment "bump stocks " used to convert the legal guns into assault weapons are legal. These need to be banned too.
2012 2018-02-21 17:28:28 @SpeakerRyan Do your job and protect us from your gun toting NRA cronies. Eliminate gun shows, bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity magazines, fund mental health care, better data base integration for background checks, raise the age to purchase any weapon.
2013 2018-02-21 17:28:09 @realDonaldTrump Do your job and protect us from your gun toting NRA cronies. Eliminate gun shows, bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity magazines, fund mental health care, better data base integration for background checks, raise the age to purchase any weapon.
2014 2018-02-21 17:27:48 And way to announce your planned ban on bump stocks, allowing sales to soar ahead of time.
2015 2018-02-21 17:27:41 @marcorubio Do your job and protect us from your gun toting NRA cronies. Eliminate gun shows, bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity magazines, fund mental health care, better data base integration for background checks, raise the age to purchase any weapon.
2016 2018-02-21 17:27:13 They Want Fix NICS, Ban Bump Stocks, Increase Age For Rifle Purchases. And what do we get. Let’s deal. We want National Reciprocity.
2017 2018-02-21 17:27:07 I find it much more constructive to look at what the stocks that make up the market are  doing rather than have theoretical arguments about why we do or do not have to retest the lows.

Don't just guess; pay attention to breadth, leadership & indiv. stocks to form an opinion.
2018 2018-02-21 17:26:51 What about the bigger sleeper story reveals about teachers pension funds invested in gun stocks. And now there will be major Sell offs damaging that gun companies. Why are the schools where the shootings are with teachers whose pensions are in gun stock?
2019 2018-02-21 17:26:25 Trump pulled a fast one. The Obama administration reviewed the law pertaining to automatic weapons and concluded an Administrative Rule banning Bump Stocks would likely not be legal and therefore concluded Legislation was required. Trump gave DOJ a poison pill.
2020 2018-02-21 17:26:23 Stop quoting the bible. Do your job and protect us from your gun toting NRA cronies. Eliminate gun shows, bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity magazines, fund mental health care, better data bases for background checks.
2021 2018-02-21 17:26:23 The WH is trying to offer up bump stocks, devices used to upgrade your weapon up to an assault weapon, but doesn’t want to ban assault weapons. This makes zero fucking sense!
2022 2018-02-21 17:26:11 Ar15 s and bump stocks also need to be banned ! Nothing less is acceptable! You need to listen to all americans  on all issues , not just your base. Your base will forgive you for anything but the rest of anericans won't and you and Republicans will be vited out ! Get smart !
2023 2018-02-21 17:26:10 @realDonaldTrump  I agree with banning bump stocks! I agree with better backround checks. I do not think that any law will make a maniac or deranged person say " Oh my! I better not commit this crime or I may get in trouble". Arm and train Teachers.
2024 2018-02-21 17:25:53 You r a expert.Give us few stocks idea to buy
2025 2018-02-21 17:25:53 part of the problem when I have done them is that it encourages short term/day trading habits. The kids remember that one dude who put it all in some obscure stock that took off--they don't remember the danger in that or the long-term benefit of balanced portfolio/mix of stocks
2026 2018-02-21 17:25:52 Do you think it is still Okay to hold $FB given all the political news??
2027 2018-02-21 17:25:51 @guardian in spite of the protests in Florida today, banning the sale of any particular gun or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Bump Stocks should be allowed too. The problem is angry PEOPLE not weapons.  Should these items get difficult to obtain, the angry PEOPLE will turn to BOMBS
2028 2018-02-21 17:25:37 Just when I didn't think GOP could go any lower. They actually said these teens that got shot at are tools of liberals. Imagine instead of saving lives they blame Dems.  Get rid of Bump Stocks & automatic weapons. Kids are more important. Australia did & they dont have massacres.
2029 2018-02-21 17:25:35 I disagree with him, but bump stocks are a cheap gimmick, maybe he's trying to get leverage on the dems by confiding with them on something so he can more easily pass something like immigration reform.
2030 2018-02-21 17:25:33 Where are all the Dow 25,000 Hats and Pom-Poms?  No excitement is bullish.  Too much is Bearish... #Dow #stocks
2031 2018-02-21 17:25:25 Please do not give an inch on gun control, including bump-stocks. Your constituents are watching.
2032 2018-02-21 17:25:10 You definitey do not want mendatory transparency for stocks, and the other things you mentioned are better served by a centralized database.
2033 2018-02-21 17:25:03 I feel something is missing in the day till I dont hear @petenajarian on @HalftimeReport
2034 2018-02-21 17:25:01 @TheJuanWilliams know the #NRA came out questioning the legality of bump stocks & other items easy to obtain for turning a weapon into auto after #VegasShooting Additionally, the NRA doesn't make law, & that Congress & @realDonaldTrump need to make these changes. @OutnumberedFNC
2035 2018-02-21 17:24:48 Black people should go out now and buy themselves a bunch of AR-15s and bump stocks. White folks who want sensible gun control and who have all the money should finance it. These people will ignore everything but black people with legally owned weapons of war...
2036 2018-02-21 17:24:39 How can we expect you to vote concerning gun laws?  Do you support banning assault weapons as well as accessories such as bump stocks?
2037 2018-02-21 17:24:34 Mortgage Bond prices are near unchanged while Stocks grind higher. Floating is recommended.
2038 2018-02-21 17:24:24 I'm  watching from California and want to follow right behind all you kids and do whatever I can to support you. You may be able to get done what we all need: Sensible gun control: No bump stocks, no large clips, background checks, no mentally unstable access, no AK-15 or AK-47's
2039 2018-02-21 17:23:58 Me and my husband were just talking about that. I hope one of his sons starts one. Agree liberal twitter FB stocks will drop by at least half of what it is now.
2040 2018-02-21 17:23:43 I also want to ban assault rifles, close gun show loop holes, ban bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines. I want a 48-hour waiting period for firearm purchases, and secure conditions for firearms by dealers before the point of sale. We need common-sense steps to keep WI safe.
2041 2018-02-21 17:23:14 when GE rallies it's all over for stocks. Markets in turmoil @petenajarian
2042 2018-02-21 17:23:03 WMT down about 16% from its 52 week hi. Do you think it might be oversold here and a buying op I do and did #stocks
2043 2018-02-21 17:22:58 @TIME In spite of the protests in Florida today, banning the sale of an particular gun or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Bump stocks should be allowed too.  The problem is angry PEOPLE not weapons.    And should weapons get difficult to get these angry PEOPLE will turn to BOMBS
2044 2018-02-21 17:22:52 4 months later...
Trump says
bump stocks aren't good.
That $30 million payment
from the NRA 
sure delayed that response.
He cares more about $$$$
than he does about US.
2045 2018-02-21 17:22:43 Sorry, your segment is misleading and dishonest. I don't want to take all guns away. Handgun? Fine. Hunting rifle? Fine. An AR-15? No, sorry. Bump stocks? No, sorry. That's how most feel. Be honest about that. My uncle can keep hunting but he doesn't need an AR-15 to do it.
2046 2018-02-21 17:22:02 @BruceandPamela The Presidents Action against bump stocks would not have affected last weeks shooting in any way.
2047 2018-02-21 17:21:56 Obama hung his head, blamed NRA & said generic GC would stop it after each massacre.
NOT 1 PROTEST
@POTUS  Looks into camera & blamed the shooter!
5 days after he has plan:
Ban bump stocks
Raise age to 25 for AR-15
Mental ill ban
Intense BG 
PROTESTS
2048 2018-02-21 17:21:32 I've called about four different gun stores in Lubbock this morning trying to get some information on "bump stocks." Turns out there's very few stores that sell them around here. I found that interesting.
2049 2018-02-21 17:21:25 So are 17 students that never got to grow old. Banning bump stocks good start, but it’s only the beginning! nationwide background on all gun sales to include gun shows and private sales, ban assault rifles, no guns for mentally ill. NRA will hate u but we the people will love you
2050 2018-02-21 17:21:07 Talking about stocks in Finance always makes me think about Personal Finance in high school where @MitchHanmer11 made like $8000 in 3 months on his pharmaceutical company
2051 2018-02-21 17:20:58 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system
#GunReformNow
2052 2018-02-21 17:20:57 Starting a newsletter that guarantees positive returns on stocks for 4 straight weeks. If your interested just let me know #eco2307
2053 2018-02-21 17:20:33 Liberty should be promoted except where it is harmful to society. Bump stocks and auto weapons are excessive for public use. You have your handguns, rifles, shotguns to defend yourself still. It's like allowing someone to carry a knife but they then carry a samurai sword instead.
2054 2018-02-21 17:20:26 there IS a quick and simple START that can happen! Ban bump stocks, ban automatic rifles, increase age levels for purchase of guns, increase background checks, make background checks mandatory for every sale/transfer of guns Just b/c U sell to Uncle Joe doesn't mean he's not nuts
2055 2018-02-21 17:20:23 @USATODAY In spite of the protests in Florida today, banning the sale of any particular gun or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Bump Stocks should be allowed.  The problem is PEOPLE not weapons.
2056 2018-02-21 17:20:02 Should Utah consider a ban on assault weapons? @GovHerbert says he supports a ban on bump stocks, suggests it's not clear which firearms would fall under the "assault weapon" umbrella. #GovKUED #utpol

2059 2018-02-21 17:19:45 Bump stocks have been used with alot of gang shootings they need banned, we need longer checks that add mental health to many loop holes i am a nra member and i think what not is being seen or heard is 90% of members say there needs stronger checks
2060 2018-02-21 17:19:41 RT. they are. politicians/organizations who have done nothing will try to use you. We must enforce the laws, strengthen back ground laws, ban bump stocks which make guns automatic, keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill. ARM THE SCHOOLS!
2061 2018-02-21 17:19:36 #stocks  If you've no interest in studying stock reports or the market in detail, but you want to invest for your future, or your children's futue, dollar cost averaging with all dividends reinvested in a Total World Stock Index Fund is your best choice, but never trade it.
2062 2018-02-21 17:19:33 Gov. Herbert says states ought to take the lead on firearms legislation. But balks at assault weapon ban — defining an assault rifle is hard. Appropriate to do away with bump stocks. #utpol
2063 2018-02-21 17:19:17 Why 4 months after the Las Vegas massacre, are you willing 2 talk about bump stocks & background checks, & what, exactly, is the plan beyond your usual rhetoric? These kids (& their votes) will, absolutely, flip the House, & you are aware of that but you're too late.
2064 2018-02-21 17:19:11 Herbert says he agrees with Romney that states have primary role in coming up with policies for safe schools. On assault rifles, Herbert not as keen. Is ok with ban on bump stocks. #utpol #utleg #GovKUED
2065 2018-02-21 17:18:40 @OutnumberedFNC Prez Trump is again abandoning a campaign promise this time on guns. He has directed Sessions to ban bump stocks but why won't he direct him to go after IRS Lois Lerner & other Obama crooks who violated people's civil rights.
2066 2018-02-21 17:18:36 @ImKnope and @GrooveCube is stab across angry stocks !   
2067 2018-02-21 17:18:22 @NBCNews In spite of the protests in Florida, banning the sale of any particular gun or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Even banning Bump Stocks is wrong.  The problem is PEOPLE not weapons
2068 2018-02-21 17:18:11 @trish_regan You should bring out the fact that bump stocks are a product of the Dems , & repeat this fact in your reports.
2069 2018-02-21 17:17:48 I would bet any amount that Pelosi has more wealth from the stocks she owns, VIA Donald Trump. Yet they hate AMERICA.
2070 2018-02-21 17:17:35 @KennedyNation Making a rifle with a barrel shroud and pistol grip resembling a military assault rifle does not make it an assault rifle as, if I put air scoops and Pennzoil stickers on a 55 Chevy does not make it a NASCAR. Bump stocks should be banned, but now, they are selling.
2071 2018-02-21 17:17:27 Banning bump stocks is not enough. We must ban civilian possession of the AR-15.
2072 2018-02-21 17:17:05 And @AJWVictoriaBC doesn't even get the fact that the Canadian and US stocks are linked and the TMX legal issues are important enough to be disclosed in US securities 10-Q filings.
2073 2018-02-21 17:16:47 Stocks, noted. I'll add that to 'shaven'.
2074 2018-02-21 17:16:41 How many stocks do you usually track in your watchlist so that they're actionable? ie, do you try for it to be small (like 50-100?), or is a 300, 400, or more stocks watchlist still happening quite frequently for your criteria?
2075 2018-02-21 17:16:20 NRA: We should probably consider banning bump stocks

Trump: *does nothing

*School shooting that has nothing to do with bump stocks, 17 people are killed

Trump: I'm making the Attorney General ban bump stocks.
2076 2018-02-21 17:16:17 @AJNewsGrid In spite of the protests in Florida, banning sale of any particular gun or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Even banning Bump Stocks should not happen.  The problem is PEOPLE not weapons.
2077 2018-02-21 17:16:13 Trump conferenced the NRA. Bump stocks is as far as they will go.
2078 2018-02-21 17:15:58 Explain to me how that would have stopped this shooter?  He passed the background checks because the police did not put him on the domestic violence list.  He had the weapon for quite some time.  Bump stocks are junk and should be banned.
2079 2018-02-21 17:15:47 I don't give a rats ass if you ban bump stocks. But they're not the issue. Mental health, psychotropic drugs ARE the issue. All mass shooters are on them, while almost 90% suicides are on them.
#EnoughIsEnough #antidepressants
2080 2018-02-21 17:15:35 You need to read the law. Mentally ill and domestic abusers can’t purchase guns. Bump stocks aren’t going to change one thing.
2081 2018-02-21 17:15:15 I read an article last week that it was the writers 5 stocks to buy.
2082 2018-02-21 17:14:43 I know you arent a Trump fan, but I believe he took a step in the right direction with the banning stocks and cranks. I believe there is still more room, as in tougher checks, but also to arm police with military grade weaponry. This will hopefully deter the bad guys to rethink.
2083 2018-02-21 17:14:41 FakePresident: should have applied much of this emotion for those students in FL (incl. all victims of similar tragedies too)! Additionally, do something curbing/preventing more "gun violence" t-Rump!  Banning bump stocks is only a minuscule step MAGA
2084 2018-02-21 17:14:40 Doesn't look like it to me right now they're losing support for wanting regulations on bump stocks and many gun owners including me aren't to happy with trump's support of it to he also supporting  increasing gun ownership age
2085 2018-02-21 17:14:24 We need to bring back public stocks that way when a reporter lies you can just take them out into the Public Square and lock them in them for a week
2086 2018-02-21 17:14:19 Trump bans bump stocks. Big friggin deal, very few people have bump stocks. This is a NRA sponsored ruse by Republicans! Will do no good! Have the balls to do the right thing.. ban assault rifles.
2087 2018-02-21 17:14:19 You’re talking absolute nonsense, while bodies of children are being buried due to poor gun control !
Bump stocks is the best you can do ? That is just really sad, show some leadership and abolish these type weapons for the public !

2089 2018-02-21 17:13:40 @realDonaldTrump In spite of the protests in Florida, any ban on sale of any pistol or rifle is a HUGE MISTAKE.  Even banning Bump Stocks is a MISTAKE.   The problem is people NOT WEAPONS.
2090 2018-02-21 17:13:38 @realDonaldTrump Directing Sessions to ban bump stocks ?. Why not also direct him to get Lois Lerner & other Obama crooks who violated citizen's rights. Yo seem to avoid that.
2091 2018-02-21 17:13:36 Trump will ban bump stocks. All Obama did was talk.
2092 2018-02-21 17:13:35 Check the article I linked to in my first response. The Trump administration said they were looking at banning bump stocks. It's been 5 months and NOTHING has happened.
2093 2018-02-21 17:13:28 Do you think banning bump stocks will help?
2094 2018-02-21 17:13:26 There are 90 deaths every day due to gun violence or 33,000 per year. Banning bump stocks, even banning assault rifles, will do little to decrease these numbers.
There are simply too many guns on the street!
2095 2018-02-21 17:13:10 Private sector banks are better to invest rather than PSU Banks.
2096 2018-02-21 17:13:06 Classic deflection. Didn't do it after the Vegas massacre when bump stocks were used. Did it now to move people away from idea of a ban on assault-type weapons. He's sticking to the NRA line. I commend him for pulling wool over eyes of public...again
2097 2018-02-21 17:12:58 Could you imagine the outrage if Obama had mentioned the banning of bump stocks by executive order?
2098 2018-02-21 17:12:58 Don't ban bump stocks or any has nothing to do with what's going on what could help is raising the age to a rifle 221 definitely but we need to get teachers educated not to hate the president and teach bad Behavior. need to get God back in our country and schools@realDonaldTrump
2099 2018-02-21 17:12:54 @realDonaldTrump THANK you sir for

2100 2018-02-21 17:12:34 You left out: allow bump stocks to remain legal, after allowing them to even be legal in the first place.
2101 2018-02-21 17:12:30 Bump stocks R just another smoke screen,AR15 "s can easily be modified to a machine gun, besides that anyone with the IQ of and ant can make a bump stock, getting military grade weapons off the market is the only way to begin stopping these mass killings,Trump will not do it,
2102 2018-02-21 17:12:17 These same companies laying off ppl in droves. They also moving overseas. Businesses also buying their own stocks to inflate the market. Meanwhile, these tax cuts have increased our national and trade debt. The dollar is weakening because of this deficit.
2103 2018-02-21 17:12:13 Answer:  we would not ban bump stocks etc. Her Supreme Court would do that. That’s how they roll.
2104 2018-02-21 17:11:50 Stay your course David! You are doing great! Ban AR-15, enhanced background checks, ban bump stocks. Don’t let them charm you or sell you a bunch of crumbs @SenSchumer @maddow @AriMelber

2107 2018-02-21 17:11:19 What amendment is the right to own bump stocks?
2108 2018-02-21 17:11:19 To do that, the NFA would need to be re-written. Bump stocks are just plastic and NOT a firearm. Will there be an amnesty? General like in 1968?

2110 2018-02-21 17:10:49 I’m a big supporter of the 2nd amendment. Why are folks upset with Trump wanting to ban bump stocks?  How many of you all own one or know someone who does? Who actually knew what a bump stock was before it was brought up? I didn’t know until the Vegas crisis
2111 2018-02-21 17:10:45 Hey here’s an idea @realDonaldTrump. Maybe we can collect all the proposed outlawed bump stocks and build your fucking wall out of them!

2113 2018-02-21 17:10:37 Again, your base will swallow your bullshit hook line and sinker everyday all day. But the rest of us that focus strictly on facts, you only “signed a memo” about pump stocks because of Parkland. Why didnt you “sign a memo” 24 hours after Las Vegas? Your base can’t be that blind!
2114 2018-02-21 17:10:31 I cannot be the only person who thinks the argument that no NRA member has shot up a school clears them of complicity. Their membership dues go to lobbying for the legal right to bump stocks and AR-15s. They need to look those survivors in the face and explain why. #GunReformNow
2115 2018-02-21 17:10:29 Your right there, their stocks go up because of us when we leave someday it will be like the crash in the 20s without us they are nothing but John do enjoy your vacation it’s the least they owe you

2122 2018-02-21 17:09:51 CZ Frankly, I don't care about/for bump stocks. Seems like a great way to waste precious ammo. But while a prohibition can be argued, it should be argued in Congress, and decreed not from executive order.
2123 2018-02-21 17:09:50 You finally comment on a couple things I agree with such as better background checks and banning of bump stocks, then you have to go and bring up Obama. You will never learn.  @RealDonaldTrump

2126 2018-02-21 17:09:07 The reason Trump is talking waiting periods and bump stocks.
2127 2018-02-21 17:08:18 Yes, the casual observer has it all back to front. Add in likelihood of O&G stocks being pummeled in overall market downturn and capex will get further smoked. Speaking about "oil" is too vague. You have to be specific as to grade. Apples and oranges.
2128 2018-02-21 17:08:12 Here is the absolute least that congress can do in regards to gun control:

1) Make illegal to own bump stocks
2) Make illegal to own ghost guns
3) Repeal the Dickie Amendment
4) Create government buyback of all semi-auto and full-auto guns

This is the bare-minimum.
2129 2018-02-21 17:08:08 This orange cheetos tool believes for every new regulation we should get rid of two. Fine ban bump stocks and remove 922r and make assault rifle bans illegal.

The NRA never cared about bump-stocks.

2146 2018-02-21 17:03:59 I said murderers not mass murderers. Most murders are not of groups. Sorry but bump stocks and assault rifles will be banned. Much more stringent requirements need to be placed on buying guns of any kind. Requirements should be like licensing of other kinds.

2154 2018-02-21 17:02:36 They're using Depends to soak sweat at the WH. Bet Trump does exec order banning bump stocks as a feel-good smoke screen.
2155 2018-02-21 17:02:33 I though bump stocks was a euphemism for lap dance
2156 2018-02-21 17:02:27 I note that his memo does not say "ban bump stocks." It asks the DOJ to finish its review and submit proposed regulations for banning devices which convert semiautomatic weapons to fully automatic ones. Not the same as being headlined.
2157 2018-02-21 17:02:24 Ban the assault rifles. Then there will he no need to ban bump stocks.
2158 2018-02-21 17:01:54 Ban bump stocks? Ban ANYTHING?
Avoid emotionalism (and legal bloat) with a scientific approach:
1) Auto-expire the ban in 5 years.
2) Auto-create study of actual effects in 4 years.
3) Act with informed perspective.

2165 2018-02-21 17:01:07 Prediction: bump stocks will remain legal for foreseeable future. Hope I’m wrong. Banning anything gun-related is a step towards the good side (“step in the *right* direction” did not seem apropos).

2168 2018-02-21 17:00:07 I don't care what Trump thinks he's doing basically. Banning bump stocks is a complete waste of time when they can be made at home for less than $1. this helps nothing this does not save lives. And he knows it. But he wants to stand up there and Pat himself on the back. Idiot!

1) Get a bunch of minorities and women to buy an arsenal of assault weapons and bump stocks next Monday.

2) They'd be banned by Tuesday.
2174 2018-02-21 16:59:39 @CarolHLN bump stocks don’t kill people; bullets do.  Ban.Assault.Weapons.
Less guns, not more
2175 2018-02-21 16:59:32 How would you feel if we got rid of gun free zones and only had to give up buno stocks. Wouldnt yoy be for that? Let the kids have a voice and the people we voted for will have a solution.

2177 2018-02-21 16:59:05 Yep. If he even follows through on the idea of banning bump stocks.  Once one of his crazies informs him that the Dems have had a bill banning bump stocks ready since shortly after Las Vegas, he'll switch his mind ....

2180 2018-02-21 16:58:30 Trump is considering banning bump stocks. OMG he is coming for your GUNS!
2181 2018-02-21 16:58:23 Hey @CNN you and #liberals will be more successful in changing the age limit to purchase a Assault rifle then you would be at banning it. Change the age to 21 or 25. And ban bump Stocks. As a responsible gun owner I'd support that, but not banning them. #GunControlNow @NRA
2182 2018-02-21 16:57:40 I bet he wont even follow through on bump stocks.
2183 2018-02-21 16:57:34 also i applaud trump making the move to ban bump stocks! thats a huge move for solving gun violence.
2184 2018-02-21 16:57:28 What are the stats? How many of the children killed in schools in 2018 were killed by guns equipped with bump-stocks?

2187 2018-02-21 16:56:42 Bump stocks are waste of time to even talk about. This just makes me even more angry. They can be made for less than a dollar and they're easy to make. This is not even close to a solution. This helps in no way!!
2188 2018-02-21 16:56:36 My teacher today told us “Bump Stocks make SEMI autos into FULLY autos.” 

I’ll take “That’s Bullshit” for $1000 Alex
2189 2018-02-21 16:55:57 Sweetie, and I use that term very loosely, no one is attempting to bar you from owning a gun.  What we are trying to do is make auto/semi-auto weapons illegal, ban large magazines/bump stocks, strengthen back checks.  How does that effect u?
2190 2018-02-21 16:55:44 "Bump stocks" are lowest of low-hanging fruit. Even the odious NRA indicated support for some limitation on bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre because, y'know, MACHINE GUNS! Trump & Congress did nothing. Acting now is far too little, too late. We need REAL gun control.
2191 2018-02-21 16:55:40 That's it in a nutshell bump stocks are waste of time. They can be made 4 less than a dollar
2192 2018-02-21 16:55:37 Trump Changing Mind ON BUMP Stocks apply to AR 15 Weapon but not AR 15 REMEMBER 1994 Weapon Ban On same Weapons No longer Law So the Paper worth of this Republican Bill? If you Reelect Republ Party Musical Chairs Next Generation of Advanced AR 15 /Suppressors In Gun Stores @Soon
2193 2018-02-21 16:55:24 Rep Ruben Gallego really thinks Congress will act on "bump" stocks. Does anyone believe him he does?  #BanBumpStocks #RememberTheMassacres
2194 2018-02-21 16:55:14 That’s the problem with Republicans, If the economy is doing ok, stocks are growing everything is fine. Well America is not fine, we’re hurting at our soul. We have forgot what it means to love your fellow man. We have a commander In chief who could careless about his fellow man
2195 2018-02-21 16:55:00 Hahahaha ReTHUGLICANS are pathetic. Everyone invest in tin foil,  them stocks are soaring!
2196 2018-02-21 16:54:52 So, now the criminals who don't give a damn about the law is going to have bump stocks coming out the ....... machine guns, fully automatics and the movie makers will continue flaunting uzzies for their terrorist training movies for kids.
2197 2018-02-21 16:54:42 Banning bump stocks are waste of time. They can be made in your basement or garage living room 4 less than the dollar!!
2198 2018-02-21 16:54:29 serious question- images of Vegas suite showed & early reports of 2 weapon mod'd w. the "dreaded bump stocks", yet no conf. on this (or much else) these were actually used
doubtful since a bipod rig for prone delivered plunging fire would defeat operating principle of bump stock
2199 2018-02-21 16:53:37 @realDonaldTrump thank you for moving to ban bump stocks

2202 2018-02-21 16:53:19 @realDonaldTrump ..bump-stocks/background checks a good start now get rid of military style weapons used to kill masses..
2203 2018-02-21 16:53:12 My point exactly, Stocks can't be full bearer. So why use an immutable database if you might have to modify it in the future if someone lose their access? You really shouldn't use a blockchain for that.
2204 2018-02-21 16:53:05 1: If you are on the no-fly list, no guns.
2: No bump-stocks.
3: Psychological evaluation as part of background checks.
Can you and I start with agreeing on these 3 things? A lot of my hope for the future of America rides on this. Ever see a liberal beg a conservative?

If you knew anything, you'd know bump stocks are trash, and no serious 2A person gives a shit about them.
2207 2018-02-21 16:52:45 This guy in class is talking about gun stocks and guns. Can you tell I’m worried? This is an economic class.
2208 2018-02-21 16:52:37 Coming up live at noon on @SPECNewsAlbany I’ll have some reaction to President Trump’s potential ban on bump stocks
2209 2018-02-21 16:52:36 The White House now says that age limits for the purchase AR-15 rifles are “on the table.”

Also, President Trump has directed the Attorney General to push for legislation to ban “bump stocks.” 

SORRY MR. PRESIDENT, NOT GOOD ENOUGH! BAN AR-15 RIFLES NOW!!! #neveragain
2210 2018-02-21 16:52:24 The issue is the deadly combo of both....these semi automatic rifles that can do mass harm, especially when bump stocks are added to make them like a machine gun. Combine that with someone who has mental illness but was able to purchase this gun legally, it doesn’t make sense.
2211 2018-02-21 16:51:49 Exactly! It’s not within his legal purview to ban bump stocks. However, TV pundits are praising him despite being a calculated ploy to buy time until news cycle drifts away to follow sexier scandal.

2213 2018-02-21 16:51:25 I’ve converted 6 guns with bump stocks. Carry one for coyotes in the log truck. Fun to shoot.
2214 2018-02-21 16:51:22 It is funny - Higher rates should kill ponzi stocks like AMZN NFLX but they are leading the turd herd higher-- Guess Federal Reserve really needs them to keep the peasants happy
2215 2018-02-21 16:50:58 I think the President feels the need to toss the gun grabbers a morsel or two to maybe placate them. Well, he's wrong, it won't work. Raising the purchase age and banning bump stocks won't do anything to fix the problem. Bump stocks can be made at home.
2216 2018-02-21 16:50:47 $SHOP Trading at below secondary price at $137 ??  nonsense !!!  Good add.. #stocks #trade #investing
2217 2018-02-21 16:50:46 Bump Stocks, STUPID, Assault Rifle bad term and then Gun Control laws in place now.  I own several and use them as intended some good old fashion home training will go far. I have never known the NRA. to condone unlawful use.

2221 2018-02-21 16:50:18 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So now u want to BAN bump stocks and RAISE the age of gun purchases to 21 ?!!! ARE YOU KIDDING? What abt the PSYCH DRUGS that the ppl are taking? We KNOW they cause murderous impulses! You r showing ur TRUE colors! GLOBALIST-NWO!
2222 2018-02-21 16:50:08 Please add "High Capacity" magazines to the regulating "bump stocks." No legitimate reason to have 15+ round mags in our society.  These mags allow shooters sustained high volume fire with minimal loading. FL shooter fired 150 rounds.  Las Vegas shooter - 60 & 100 round mags.
2223 2018-02-21 16:50:00 Is this a response to Florida or Vegas? Weird response for Florida and not timely for Vegas. Is this an answer to, 'you have to do something'? Because this is literally doing nothing. Watch videos of people bump firing without bump stocks.
2224 2018-02-21 16:49:55 I can still print bump stocks on my 3D printer. Are you going to ban printers too?
2225 2018-02-21 16:49:36 .@realDonaldTrump Why wasn’t banning bump stocks a “priority” months ago when they were used to murder 58 people in Las Vegas? It also baffles me that you think banning an accessory will solve the actual issue.
2226 2018-02-21 16:49:35 I don't disagree. My point is, they said they were banning bump stocks after the Vegas shooting. 5 months later, nothing has come from it. 

After all the school and public mass shootings, I see very little to be optimistic about, considering they just keep loosening restrictions
2227 2018-02-21 16:49:27 I have a problem with it. Bump stocks are not the problem. That ban will fix nothing. It's pointless. The only thing it does is take away away some of our rights. Hopefull it's just to get some heat off his back but won't actually go into law. What have the democrats gave?
2228 2018-02-21 16:49:06 As if steckbeck telling me at 11:59pm that I had a test at 9am wasn’t bad enough, homie didn’t even let me finish the test this morning bc he scheduled it too close to his class time
2229 2018-02-21 16:48:56 Do, you want to ban bump stocks.  BS that is too little.  You are an NRA whore!  Your mother should have had a miscarriage.

2235 2018-02-21 16:47:54 I’ve had people on Twitter try to convince me that bump stocks were already banned shortly after #VegasShooting - they should have been after Vegas but gunlovers don’t need to perpetuate lies.
2236 2018-02-21 16:47:33 Precisely. I actually spent 10 minutes trying to find any information on what he has done on "Gun Violence" and I came to the conclusion he wants to pass a universal background check law, a ban on assault rifles and a ban on bump-fire stocks. Groundbreaking...
2237 2018-02-21 16:47:30 Trump is directing legislation to ban bump stocks. Great fucking move, a rare time I'll congratulate him
2238 2018-02-21 16:47:13 Think he is throwing them a bone with bump stocks. Would have to go through congress anyway, probably wouldn't pass. Think it is a political move only.
2239 2018-02-21 16:46:51 If you support gun reform what do you think they should do besides banning assault rifles. Removing bump stocks is good but it's not gonna stop school shootings
2240 2018-02-21 16:46:51 If Congress tries to distract by passing legislation banning bump stocks, don't let them win.  Don't let it stop there.  Demand more. Demand an assault weapons ban, demand universal background checks. Don't ever stop, keep pushing.

2243 2018-02-21 16:46:30 Why weren’t bump stocks banned after #VegasShooting ? If #NRA doesn’t oppose, what did #Trump admin have to lose by taking action then? Wouldn’t affect #FloridaSchoolShooting but could potentially save hundreds or more lives. #Trump needs 2 do more, not just what #NRA supports.

2251 2018-02-21 16:45:10 Flippers are tripping!
2252 2018-02-21 16:44:55 Foul language or loss of rights? What's more offensive? But you're right. I felt bad that I swore. Doesn't change the sentiment. A ban is an infringement. It really doesn't matter your thoughts or my thoughts on bump stocks. What matters is that it's a peeling away of rights.
2253 2018-02-21 16:44:35 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NRA if you want your core to turn on you, continue talking about bump stocks and gun control.  My loyalty is to our Constitutional Republic, not the NRA or the president.  #2ndAmendment #GunControlNever

2257 2018-02-21 16:43:58 @TuckerCarlson morning Tucker , I guess we are banning bump stocks now.

2266 2018-02-21 16:42:23 No serious shooter gives two rips about bump stocks.
Trump will use this to take the wind out of Dem sails.
Just watch...
2267 2018-02-21 16:42:19 Personally, I think any additional gun control is not the way to go. However, I live in a Democracy where we need to compromise. What is the other side willing to compromise on? How about bump stocks for National Reciprocity?

No. He is not.

2282 2018-02-21 16:39:49 I hope bump stocks & strengthening Background Checks are the first and LAST "gun control" ideas from the administration. Gun control is JUST PC. We expect the 2nd Amendment to be VINDICATED during YOUR administration.
2283 2018-02-21 16:39:49 You know Obama legalized bump stocks?
2284 2018-02-21 16:39:33 I think getting rid of bump stocks is a good idea. I don’t know why they were a thing in the first place. We’ll see, I guess. I’m on the side of optimism, and I like to withhold judgement until something happens.
2285 2018-02-21 16:39:33 Read good books, Trust ur instincts, stay away from people giving magic formula & targets - Business are dynamic & so is there potential

Understand reasoning, if convinced & price right, invest. Focus on stocks with longevity of growth, U may err on price but time will compound
2286 2018-02-21 16:39:20 And just FYI, bump stocks original design was to assist ppl with fine motor skills issues like say a vet who has lost fingers. But the design was perverted/subverted. What shoulda happened was a permit to own just like a handicap parking permit
2287 2018-02-21 16:38:57 @RalphMassullo, @WiltonSimpson, @RepWebster, What are your positions/votes on bump-stocks, gun show loop holes, CDC gun violence research, repealing Obama restrictions on sales to mentally ill?
2288 2018-02-21 16:38:54 It was read on O'Reilly's site. You know it's got to be true.   Better yet... the conspiracy theory is that the shooter was paid by Hillary.

2290 2018-02-21 16:38:44 @RepThomasMassie on @840WHAS disagrees with ban on AR15 , bump stocks or any INFRINGEMENT
2291 2018-02-21 16:38:44 Unless they ban these AR-15S is safe FOR THE NRA that bump stocks & background checks are done. Tougher gun laws, age to purchase guns. Implement (even though mentally ill is interchangeable with terrorist) what DT rolled back out of spite. NRA still in the GOP WH pocket. FLA HAH
2292 2018-02-21 16:38:41 As a former officer how many times did you encounter bump stocks? Just not sure I see the point of a City ban on something that isn’t used in City violent crime anyway. Try a ban on cheap $120 Hi Point pistols that are actually confiscated daily
2293 2018-02-21 16:38:34 Why don't you put out another executive order on bump stocks and assault weapons. Instead of a listening meeting that won't accomplish anything ,obviously your are not committed to anything that your party doesn't like, get a backbone for once.

2295 2018-02-21 16:38:27 The only reason they are talking about banning Bump stocks is because the NRA knows they are in trouble and this would be a way of making it seem like at least they are doing something.  #ItsANothingBurger

2298 2018-02-21 16:38:04 we have had enough of Budget commentary this afternoon ......lets discuss some stocks!!
2299 2018-02-21 16:37:55 Trump is only pushing ExecOrder because he’s been told: that won’t cut it—To regulate bump stocks, you need a “law” passed by Congress, dude! More promises & lies from guy who does NOTHING good for Americans & then there’s that little barrier—there’s no money in it for TrumpCorp!
2300 2018-02-21 16:37:35 RIP Reverend #BillyGraham sending “AR-15’s and Bump Stocks” to the family and friends. 
2301 2018-02-21 16:37:34 I respect your opinion but can I ask why you want bump stocks to be available?
2302 2018-02-21 16:36:59 I support the 2nd amendment & opposes the filthy Dems attempts to eliminate our freedom, but they can ban Bump Stocks. The answer isn’t more gun control. We see how that works in Dem Chicago, murder city USA.
2303 2018-02-21 16:36:35 The truth is I’d like bump stocks outlawed but only because they wildly decrease the accuracy of a weapon… Get it? ‘Gun control!’ Hahaha!

Trade them for suppressors, call it “gun control, hearing protection, and rifle power reduction bill”

2306 2018-02-21 16:36:19 Ehhh, Bump Stocks are incredibly hard to use. And even at Maximum Efficiency, Bump Stocks still don't shoot at a rate that most Automatics Shoot at
2307 2018-02-21 16:36:19 If you ban bump stocks, which can be easily made in your garage..

Then the next shooting 3 months from now it will be something ELSE, and then we'll need a ban on something new next time...

And it will go on and on until they ban gun ownership

Don't EVER give the Left an inch
2308 2018-02-21 16:36:18 Question:  

If Hillary had been elected, with a GOP Congress and a raging base ... do you think we would be discussing banning bump stocks, enhanced federal background checks and raising the age for gun purchases?

It seems that the most dangerous place for Liberty is #GOP rule.
2309 2018-02-21 16:36:03 True. Perhaps because Presidents Clinton and Obama made efforts to enact legislation that would support a safer school environment.

@Potus 45 has proposed banning bump stocks, six months after they gained notoriety for killing a bunch of adults.
2310 2018-02-21 16:35:56 "A slow, longer term grind may allow stronger stocks to detach and push higher" - great insight, a slow fall is quite different from a rapid one!
2311 2018-02-21 16:35:40 I took out 12k shares
2312 2018-02-21 16:35:17 Banning bump stocks is a slap in the face.
How about banning the guns they go on..?????
2313 2018-02-21 16:35:03 NRA... If you want me to support you do not advocate bans on gun accessories such as Bumpfire Stocks.
2314 2018-02-21 16:34:59 heres the problem...it wasnt a Assault weapon. it just had that Shape to it. thats it. SO many non gun users mis identifying a weapon is infuriating. Assault weapons for civilians are already banned. Not the stocks. that makes sense. those suck and arent really useful.
2315 2018-02-21 16:34:54 I'll guarantee they have no idea WHO you are or care what YOU think either.  Smart kids!  Now go back to offering "thoughts and prayers" for the next shooting.  

Maybe at that point Trump will ban assault weapons - as bump stocks had nothing to do with this massacre.
2316 2018-02-21 16:34:53 #stocks#StockMarket  Stocks should pay you from their free cash flow over many years. Buy only choice stocks with a pedegree and pay you a dividend. Otherwise, ignore them for the long haul. Buy stocks as art collectors would consider a Rembrandt.
2317 2018-02-21 16:34:52 Maybe October would have been a good time to deal with bump stocks. Regardless of whether it's a sliding stock or a stationary one, it's a distraction from the real problem: the death machine it's attached to.
2318 2018-02-21 16:34:48 I agree with the high capacity magazines & bump stocks. Waiting period should be as long as it takes beauracracy to dot Is & cross Ts. It should not be easier to obtain a gun than it is to get an IEP for a special needs student.
2319 2018-02-21 16:34:45 I agree. Give them bump stocks if it will shut them up for a minute!
2320 2018-02-21 16:34:42 I don’t understand how banning bump stocks gon stop mfs from shooting shit up but ok..

2323 2018-02-21 16:34:21 Almost every hand gun is semi automatic. This is a ridiculous want, how about just do things that actually make sense. Bump stocks, mental health background before buying (depending on what what they want to deem unstable for gun ownership), armed guards at schools.
2324 2018-02-21 16:34:18 Now? Now u are about gun control? Even the NRA at time of the LasVegas disaster was in favor of banning bump stocks...& from you?...silence. So, NOW, that you've been called out once again u are going to do something about LasVegas...when will you do something that truly counts?

2326 2018-02-21 16:33:53 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks' 4 months after Las Vegas shooting.  The next thing TTrump will ban will more  than likely be the 2nd Amendment. And all this time we thought he supported the right to bear arms. Forget a ban, make the law enforcement agencies do their damn jobs.
2327 2018-02-21 16:33:46 Can you please explain why did you buy near 73 price?

I'm asking bcoz usually you only tend to purchase stocks lifting out of clearly defined bases with volume but that was not the criteria here
2328 2018-02-21 16:33:46 @jimwelch1 I support: 
Background checks on ALL purchases including gun shows!
Must be 21 to purchase a weapon- 18 years olds mental/criminal records are still sealed. 
Ban assault style weapons.
Limit size of magazines
Obviously bump stocks
2329 2018-02-21 16:33:30 Gov. Hogan refuses to support common-sense bill banning bump stocks, because he doesn’t “think anyone in the history of our state has ever been killed with a bump stock.” Before October 1st, no one in Nevada
had been killed by a semiautomatic w/ bump stock either. #EndGunViolence

2333 2018-02-21 16:32:39 I have a buddy at work who trolled a gun group with anti-Trump content to watch them try to defend why it totally makes sense that bump stocks should be made illegal since Trump said so. To their credit, they were consistent and said Screw Trump, so he unhappily deleted his post
2334 2018-02-21 16:32:26 No bump stocks needed 
Clips holding no more than nine needed.
But also kids who have 39 police reports should be notified to all agencies. Along with FBI reports, autism, adhd,depression .
This to should be a matter not taken lightly as well
2335 2018-02-21 16:32:26 Stop lying. Bump stocks don't make a gun into an automatic weapon. That's BS and you know that, or at least should know that. If that was the case they would already be illegal because automatic weapons require a class 3 firearm license. Do your research NYT.
2336 2018-02-21 16:32:21 Love this! Look at O/S!!
2337 2018-02-21 16:32:17 @CNN NOPE Trump did not call for banning Bump Stocks.

2368 2018-02-21 16:28:07 Thanks for the response. I could put buy stops with my brokerage but I want to see volume before I buy.  As seen with other stocks like ATHM, they crossed the key list buy point today but retreated.  I wouldn't want to have that situation.
2369 2018-02-21 16:27:56 @realDonaldTrump good morning Mr President. We don't need to ban bump stocks. You can bump fire a semi automatic weapon without a stock. It's on u tube.  What's next banning u tube. I know there is public pressure,  mental health and maybe raising age to 21. Have a great day

2370 2018-02-21 16:27:49 President Trump did sign executive order to stop selling bump stocks to public. New gun owners need more thorough & extensive backgrounds done including longer wait time. To and include checking school records.

2380 2018-02-21 16:25:19 Yup. And regulating them and making them very difficult to get, miraculously, works in this country where apparently gun laws don't work. No reason for extended magazines and bump stocks, either. Along the same reasoning of fully auto being unnecessary.
2381 2018-02-21 16:25:13 Oh wait, you need to spread some truth...President Trump banned bump stocks yesterday.  Come on Nora ... how much does Soros pay you to omit truth, 2 million?
2382 2018-02-21 16:24:47 Perhaps so called "bump stocks" should be categorized in the same manner as full auto firearms! Don't ban them, but treat them in the same manner as a machine gun/ sub-machine gun! I don't have a problem with that!
2383 2018-02-21 16:24:36 Remember folks, the ethical investor doesn't buy gun stocks.

2392 2018-02-21 16:23:23 Don’t get me wrong I think they should regulated at the very least. But if you seriously think bump stocks caused that amount of damage at that distance you’ve got your facts wrong. Go shoot a few AR’s equipped with bump stocks and a few without them and tell me your grouping.
2393 2018-02-21 16:23:19 You’re missing the whole point. Military style weapons aren’t needed on the streets, neither are bump  stocks, quick loaders and high capacity magazines. Bad hunter or bad intent. Which is it?
2394 2018-02-21 16:23:13 Laws restricting mods (e.g., bump stocks) to “as sold” guns will not protect innocent lives. Armed teachers and security guards will.

Any attempt by DOJ to bans bump stocks will end up in the Courts.
2411 2018-02-21 16:21:05 @SarahPalinUSA good morning. Now they are wanting to ban bump stocks everywhere. You probably know how to bump fire. You can go to u tube and learn to bump fire without a stock.  I guess they are going to ban u tube next. Have a great day

2418 2018-02-21 16:19:48 After seeing what happened in Las Vegas, I suspect that almost everyone (at least the sane ones) would disapprove of 'Bump Stocks'.
2419 2018-02-21 16:19:17 Oh, sidenote.. bump stocks were part of the ban. Which go on more than just the AR-15. I'm still able to go purchase an AR, legally, at any shop that carries them.
2420 2018-02-21 16:19:11 Great! As a licensed gun owner, I hope he does listen.  I hope he negotiates as well

2424 2018-02-21 16:18:52 Happy to hear @realDonaldTrump is in favor of banning bump stocks, it's not a gun and not covered by 2nd amendment.  Yet, in my heart the questions I want to ask the students are, Was that troubled boy picked on by you?   Why didn't the coach that helped so many help him?
2425 2018-02-21 16:18:37 Stocks starting higher bouncing from yesterday. Tech strong. Digesting higher rates and a huge flow of new government debt. Highest yields in a long time. $tsla $fb $aapl

2430 2018-02-21 16:18:04 @realDonaldTrump @JeffSessions_  Banning Bump Stocks is the Right Thing; and You Can Make It Happen #Parkland
2431 2018-02-21 16:18:02 If you eliminate all mass shootings it wouldn’t make a dent on firearm deaths and injuries in this country which occur predominantly mostly from suicides and “regular” shootings. Banning bump stocks, while reasonable, will make even less of a dent on these deaths and injuries.
2432 2018-02-21 16:17:59 Of course he knows bump stocks were not used at the school. The GOP-NRA-trump gang is just dangling the bump stock as a bone to the students as a delay tactic, hoping emotions will quiet down and be forgotten, as in the past shootings. Disgraceful!!

2434 2018-02-21 16:17:43 Your attempt to calm our upset regarding automatic weapons ( what you call a “machine gun” ) with the banning of bump-stocks is insulting.  Now is the time to ban killing machines. Now is the time to protect children and teachers in schools. Going to school should be safe.
2435 2018-02-21 16:17:19 More whataboutism. Roe v Wade dealt with this in 1973. Now have a real discussion about assault rifles and bump stocks.

2442 2018-02-21 16:15:56 agreed. those stocks are pretty stupid.
2443 2018-02-21 16:15:50 I’m not for banning the AR-15, but Congress should easily pass restrictions on purchases to the mentally ill, domestic abusers, and terrorists (watch list). Tighter background checks and wait periods should be enforced. And you can ban bump stocks. #velshiruhle @GOP @DNC @NRA
2444 2018-02-21 16:15:48 So, you/we can buy military-type fire arms. Trump has asked his attorney general to propose new regulations that would ban bump stocks, devices that allow rifles to fire more rapidly and he’s tweeted about “strengthening” background checks for guns. The carnage will go on ...
2445 2018-02-21 16:15:48 wait, so you have not laughed, or done anything to celebrate life, since the tragic shooting? did you bother to commend the President for outlawing bump stocks? or for addressing the death of those students? no? spread love, not hate... #LiberalLogic?
2446 2018-02-21 16:15:44 Ban on bump stocks is just a diversion. NRA trying to appease people so they back off on meaningful gun laws, like banning Assault Weapons. Don't fall for it! The gun is still there and a killing machine. #BumpStockBan
2447 2018-02-21 16:15:32 Get some Balls And handle this @POTUS . Also, Your starting to show DEEP STATE COLORS WTH !!! is up with Ban on BUMP STOCKS and Changing the age to own a gun !?I Guess you need to change the age to join the military to 21 How does that sound ? ridiculous !
2448 2018-02-21 16:15:18 stocks up or down 4% is a good one
2449 2018-02-21 16:15:15 No, I heard him say ban anything that turns a gun into a machine gun. There is a debate as to whether bumb stocks do that and it could turn out that they don't agree it does. so he was being very sneaky about it.
2450 2018-02-21 16:15:08 There is nothing special about an "AR" type weapon that makes it better at killing than any other type. Bump stocks are stupid gimmicks that no competitive shooter would use if they were allowed. Rifles in general are used so rarely in crimes they are barely worth discussing.
2451 2018-02-21 16:15:05 $LTRX 2.24 on watch ; low volume
2452 2018-02-21 16:15:02 Yes bump stocks are for automatic weapons, they should not sell them because auto's are illegal. Background checks for rifles needs to be the same for handguns much more strict. We have no security guards at our schools just resource offices in the vicinity, no armed teachers.
2453 2018-02-21 16:15:00 When they ban bump stocks, black market will open up to sell them for big$$$ even though it is just a piece of plastic composite. Crooks do not obey the law.

Are you saying the president was wrong to approve the sale of bump stocks?
If so, are you suggesting that they should be illegal now?

2465 2018-02-21 16:11:45 Wouldn't it be nice if the media did their homework on actual sales of bump stocks. Majority of gun owners and NRA are against them. Not that many made or sold. They are a novelty that really serve no purpose.

2468 2018-02-21 16:11:37 Shows how little Trump knows what he is talking about. Banning bump stocks can only be done through legislation. FAT CHANCE WITH NRA PULLING THE STRINGS.

2470 2018-02-21 16:11:23 So Trump asked DOJ to consider thinking about regulating bump stocks, which they have already asked ATF to do after Las Vegas, and isn't being specific about it. Seems like a pressure release of no real substance.

2474 2018-02-21 16:10:58 Exactly. You can, and I do, support both. I've asked so many hard line gun owners what would be wrong with banning bump stocks, guns designed to fire 90 rounds per minute, background checks, and licensing for a start. I get called names or told to mind my own business. SMFH
2475 2018-02-21 16:10:49 POTUS says he is "open to" a bacon bump stocks? With his track record does this mean anything or is this designed to be a palliative headline that lets time pass until the US forgets and moves on to other priorities. Act like the lids who are keeping this national alive!

2479 2018-02-21 16:10:36 What if the armed teacher is overcome by an angry student who takes their gun and shoots up the classroom? What's Plan B? How about banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines - let's start there.
2480 2018-02-21 16:10:32 You're right no one does need automatic rifles, that's why the shootings have been carried out with bump stocks on semi-automatic rifles, and guess whats getting banned, bump stocks

2485 2018-02-21 16:09:57 Agreed -- so does that mean you believe in universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and taking assault weapons off the streets?

2500 2018-02-21 16:07:57 The bump stocks turn semi-automatic into machine guns where multiple rounds can be shot as in the Las Vegas shootings.  AR-15's are semi- automatic.

2507 2018-02-21 16:07:04 What exactly has Trump done here?  He’s not changed anything and - spoiler alert- he won’t.  Even if bump stocks were banned it doesn’t change whether civilians should be able to buy weapons designed for storming buildings.
2508 2018-02-21 16:06:56 tRump says he's directed AG Sessions to "propose changes that would ban bump fire stocks". Nice lame response from the same guy who makes it rain executive orders like dollar bills at a strip club.

2510 2018-02-21 16:06:36 bonds keep going down but stocks know better
2511 2018-02-21 16:06:35 Regardless of that they should be banned. It requires a significant background check to buy fully automatic weapons and bump stocks are just a way to bypass that process. It’s way past time for the rhetoric on both sides to stop and work on logical, effective legislation.

It took another horrific gun massacre involving many children for him to now bring bump stocks back up and now is ready to “consider” raising the age limit.

Bump stocks just allow semi-automatics to function more like fully automatics. Carnage can still happen (read: Parkland). Nothing short of a semi-automatic ban will be sufficient.

2524 2018-02-21 16:04:54 So what you are saying is that there is NO practical use in our communities for bump stocks whatsoever.
2525 2018-02-21 16:04:53 We demand the regulation of bump stocks, the banning of high-fire-rate weapons and large catridges, age limits on purchasing deadly weapons, and more educational resources to help kids resolve conflicts peacefully and mindfully.

2527 2018-02-21 16:04:32 Good call!
2528 2018-02-21 16:04:31 Yes. Banning bump stocks will surely protect schools and gun free zones from  another attack.
2529 2018-02-21 16:04:23 Banning bump stocks and strengthening background checks is not the answer.  Ban all sales of weapons of mass destruction to anyone except the military and the police.
2530 2018-02-21 16:04:20 Leaving aside the minefield of Chicago, it's true we can deal with mass shootings by banning assault weapons/bump stocks/etc., and that wouldn't totally solve our more general gun death problem. But we can only do what is politically feasible now.
2531 2018-02-21 16:04:19 And automatic guns r already illegal plus trump just banned bump stocks.
2532 2018-02-21 16:04:04 That's not actually correct.  The bump stock does not pull the trigger, your finger does. The spring loaded bump stocks worked as you describe and were actually deemed to be full auto devices by the ATF and are not for sale.  Your comments illustrate why the misinformation.
2533 2018-02-21 16:03:59 It’s also a weapon that’s killed hundreds of people in multiple shootings including Parkland, Orlando, San Bernadino, Santa Monica and many more. There is no waiting period for purchases of it, it can be added to with sights, mags & stocks and shoots at 3200 feet per second :(

2535 2018-02-21 16:03:49 Raising the age for gun ownership and banning BUMP STOCKS is a great beginning. Now add armed guards and metal detectors and our children will have a more secure environment.
2536 2018-02-21 16:03:47 That’s why untrained civilians going nuts use bump stocks and high-capacity magazines...
2537 2018-02-21 16:03:32 Congress & Amerc ppl please read. If @realDonaldTrump was SERIOUS about banning bump stocks for guns, he'd do the following TODAY. He'd sign an EXECUTIVE ORDER in public banning bump stocks. TODAY. Then, if the NRA wanted to challenge in court, so be it. He's playing America.

2542 2018-02-21 16:02:44 Attention all you liberals... The bump stock has not been used in a shooting since the Las Vegas massacre, and if you actually listened to his speech, Pres Trump has been exploring the legalities of banning bump stocks and working on it for a months.

2544 2018-02-21 16:02:36 While many are reporting that Trump has banned "bump stocks", he has only directed his attorney general to PROPOSE changes that would ban them. A new rule might never happen, and even if it does, it likely wouldn't affect those already on the streets.

Tiny POSSIBLE step forward.

2550 2018-02-21 16:02:16 You don't understand the argument for them then. To ban bump stocks you would have to redefine what a machine gun is, and since bump firing can be done with no modification to semi autos it would open the door to a ban on all semi auto rifles.

2573 2018-02-21 15:59:44 Good observation, seems to be a double standard when it comes to guns. Obama signed legislation to legalize bump stocks, Trump signed executive order to ban them. It will be interesting to see how liberals square that circle.

2576 2018-02-21 15:59:36 Dear @realDonaldTrump aka President Asshole. Lack of bump stocks may have slowed the Vegas shooter. It won’t do squat for school shooters. Did you know hooking your thumb in your belt loop will do the same as a bump stock? I’ve never fired an assault rifle and even I know this.
2577 2018-02-21 15:59:34 IMO Bump stocks are worthless toys. Buy some fireworks if you like loud noises.
2578 2018-02-21 15:59:32 People don't seem to acknowledge Trumps move to ban bump stocks. Isn't this a step in the right direction? Or have we fallen accustomed to this political divide and fail to recognize when the opposing party is trying to work with the other?

2645 2018-02-21 15:51:21 That's exactly why he went to Sessions he knows it can't be done by executive order he also knows there has been a bill since the Las Vegas shooting to ban bump stocks and repukicans won't bring it to a vote. He doesn't want to do a damn thing about it

2655 2018-02-21 15:49:31 They thought full auto because he used bump stocks
2656 2018-02-21 15:49:31 For bump stocks? Nope. I was blaming him for not doing anything about them until the kids spoke out.
2657 2018-02-21 15:49:30 He can’t just “show up anyway”. Do you know how disruptive a presidential presence is? He’s pushing for a ban on bump stocks. If you want him to hold someone responsible, demand accountability from the FBI who could’ve prevented this. But not going to the funeral is excusable

2664 2018-02-21 15:48:39 @realDonaldTrump says bump stocks should be illegal. A logical extension of that is ANY rapid fire weapon should be illegal. This isn't difficult. Other countries have set the example. Are we smart enough to follow? #ParklandShooting
2665 2018-02-21 15:48:22 For once, I agree w/you: YES, we have to strengthen background checks. And banning bump stocks is NOT enough: we need to reauthorize the ban on assault weapons, AND ban high-capacity magazines. Keep handguns for self-defense and rifles for hunting.

2675 2018-02-21 15:46:14 Meth isn’t as popular as cocaine or heroin. As for Walmart, doesn’t have an FFL for the majority of their stores. Bump stocks only make a semi-auto gun automatic. They greatly reduce the accuracy of the weapon and are pretty impractical

2695 2018-02-21 15:43:12 It appears markets, commodities, forex and stocks are all holding position and waiting for FOMC Minutes this afternoon. Volatility pending.
2696 2018-02-21 15:43:02 I agree with President Trump when he said he wants to ban Bump Stocks. An AR-15 is a legal, Semi automatic Rifle. To own any Automatic Weapon is against the law. And to Modify a semi-automatic in any way to fire automatic is against the Law. Why do you need an automatic weapon?
2697 2018-02-21 15:42:35 This has been tried and failed. Plus the way you identify an “assault weapon” is highly subjective and not based on anything particularly extra-dangerous about the gun.  Bump stocks I think are already illegal, or should be. High-capacity magazines are illegal in a lot of places.
2698 2018-02-21 15:42:29 The first nouns should be gun safely-no more assault rifles & gun stocks.  EVERY country has mental health issues--and don't have 33,000 gun deaths a year!!!

2705 2018-02-21 15:41:28 #stocks  Interesting to note if you had invested money in the DOW 30 in January 1928 with all divdends invested (this covers the Coolidge boom, the Great Depression, WWI, and what follows), you would have a return of 33,334% adjusted for inflation. From Jan 1968 it's 2075.603%
2706 2018-02-21 15:41:26 @DLoesch 

Dana, what is your position on banning bump stocks and "anything" that would increase rate of fire?

To me this goes into performance trigger systems too. Does it prevent assembly of a stripped lower end? Any trigger will increase its rate of fire.
2707 2018-02-21 15:41:23 @sarahchad_ "The only way to close this loophole permanently is legislation. He should call on Congress to pass Senator Feinstein’s bill to ban bump stocks, rather than just draft memos," Schumer said in a statement, referring to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.
2708 2018-02-21 15:41:22 Banning bump stocks is a good and easy first step. We need to ban assault rifles and strengthen background checks to really accomplish anything.
2709 2018-02-21 15:41:21 In a thriving economy, it’s not just economists who expect interest rate increases. It is something investors assume almost without thinking, hence the occasional sell off in stocks.

2716 2018-02-21 15:40:43 Oh and BTW whay are you not out bragging about your ban on bump stocks? You incessantly brag about your actions that you think are positive for our country. Frankly I think it’s a positive thing you did but you have not said boo about it. Are you afraid of the NRA?

2742 2018-02-21 15:35:46 A semi automatic weapon can still kill a lot of people.  Should not be readily available to anybody.  And president Stupid and his pals in congress have done nothing re bump stocks which turn these weapons into automatic weapons.  So can we expect you to start lobbying him?
2743 2018-02-21 15:35:33 You can't bumpfire from a window shooting down, full auto fire isn't even an effective method of fire, and bump stocks are plastic pieces of trash that the gun community regard as gimmicks. I don't give a shit if you ban them because they don't do anything anyways.

2769 2018-02-21 15:30:23 They have no idea. The push to ban bump stocks is not based on rational thought but on emotional appeal. Most folks behind the ban have no idea how a bump stock (or bumping) works.

Vegas shooter used a bump stock, converted a semi-auto into fully auto &killed 50+ people.
This was October &yet u can still legally buy semi-auto’s &bump stocks today.
It’s insane &it needs to end
2772 2018-02-21 15:29:30 Stocks actively being included and removed from the Nifty 50 !!!!
Churn is like that of a fund manager 
2773 2018-02-21 15:29:29 The only result of this mess will be more ARs and bump stocks sold. Bet me
2774 2018-02-21 15:29:07 Yeah...you wonder how much chip stocks have left in the tank after recent, shorter term run?
2775 2018-02-21 15:28:56 fuck donald trump you think banding bump stocks on ar-15 will stop school shooters. you said it is time to protect our children. protect the children  #ProtectOurChildren
2776 2018-02-21 15:28:52 Bump stocks or not, even the family of the designer of that weapon said he never intended it to be in the hands of civilians. Nobody needs a spray weapon or high capacity clips.
2777 2018-02-21 15:28:50 Stick to quality stocks in your portfolio with higher allocation to large cap funds and PMS. And take advantage of all significant dips to add to your equity portfolio. India is in a sweet spot for next 10 years !!
2778 2018-02-21 15:28:31 @Brendanekstrom 
So Trump is trying to make moves toward gun control - raising age limit on AR purchases and banning bump stocks. Meeting with the Parkland community and survivors today. What do you think?
2779 2018-02-21 15:28:21 $ANTH and $AKER are the two stocks actually persevering and not just crashing on down. At least not yet.
2780 2018-02-21 15:28:12 Time for all conservatives to leave twitter and Get On GAB! Twitter will be all liberal loons! Twitter stocks will sink!!!
2781 2018-02-21 15:27:56 Cash is the best place until things settle. What is wrong with it. To savings before you lose it. Stocks are greater that 150% of GDP. You want to own that?
2782 2018-02-21 15:27:52 I believe it was a prank to just to receive some media attention. Else why would someone intentionally mention mostly non FnO stocks in that fake circular to create panic for short positions
2783 2018-02-21 15:27:51 Also: "Ban things which weren't used or even present at the crime scene!"
(bump stocks, plastic tacti-cool looking rifle components, etc.)
2784 2018-02-21 15:27:47 it wasn't an assault rifle so please stop spreading the lies, the issue is that you can buy a rifle without the same level of scrutiny that you have when you purchase a hand gun. I want the same laws and background checks for all weapons, banning bump stocks I am also in favor of
2785 2018-02-21 15:27:18 Confirmation bias. You choose the 2 cos that go out of business to prove your pt. The other 99% were great buys during those times!! Buying the beaten down stocks (or just the SP500) in 2001 and 2009 were amazing strategies!! Huge gains if you had a long time horizon!!!
2786 2018-02-21 15:26:50 10 years back- Lehman Crisis

2787 2018-02-21 15:26:34 Gee, let’s get optimistic that Trump will be against bump stocks. That’s like saying, I hope we can get Trump to come out against Hitler...or Putin...
2788 2018-02-21 15:26:33 @sendavidperdue Sir, as a veteran ,i agree to ban gun stocks,however not assult weapons.If a man or woman is old enough to serve our country,they are adults.This is a mental health issue not an excuse for dem to get votes
2789 2018-02-21 15:26:20 Why doesn't @realDonaldTrump just sign one of his cherished Executive Orders to ban bump stocks. He signed an EO to ban Muslims; why not one to ban bump stocks?
2790 2018-02-21 15:26:19 Sounds good to me!
2791 2018-02-21 15:26:01 @SenatorBooker please add your voice to those who oppose assault weapons . #BanAR15 and bump stocks #NotOneMore #NoNRAMoney
2792 2018-02-21 15:25:52 @realDonaldTrump @NRA #NRA #2A banning bump stocks is an feel good measure. It doesn't stop bump fire.
2793 2018-02-21 15:25:49 Yes, and we need to allow studies on gun violence. All manner of causes, from the weapons, access, emotional health, age, gun education, bump stocks, background checks. We need EVERYTHING on the table again.

2799 2018-02-21 15:25:16 @realDonaldTrump I asked you to leave my second amendments alone! Bump stocks were never used in a school shooting! We also know Las Vegas was a false flag! I guess you are not for the 2nd amendment which shall not be infringed upon! You sir are losing my interest! My family too!
2800 2018-02-21 15:25:15 Ban bump stocks, better background checks follow up on leads! Abolish gun free zones armed guards at schools. Train teachers and arm them to have at least a fighting chance. The root cause is lack of parenting and unstable people pushed into our society and political correctness
2801 2018-02-21 15:25:14 Executive order banning bump stocks. Good job, Trump.
2802 2018-02-21 15:25:10 Bump stocks are a non-issue. Gun ignorant people's imaginations go wild. They think AR means assault riffle!

2805 2018-02-21 15:24:27 The floor in both House & Senate. So his memo does ZERO. Congress has to change the laws to ban them & also gat cranks which work by placing inside trigger area w a crank on the side. As fast as you can push the crank, fast bullets fly. Just like bump stocks.
2806 2018-02-21 15:24:24 l thought bump stocks were banned a long time ago?
2807 2018-02-21 15:24:19 Billionaires don't pay large amounts of their wealth in income tax because they don't make their money in income.
His wealth is in stocks, etc. 
If his wealth was income, that money is taxed at the 37% current rate for incomes over $500k. 
So his $92B would pay out ~32B in tax.
2808 2018-02-21 15:24:02 Only right-wing pinheads will take the time to listen to this has-been. I propose a new reality show, where these guys team up, one team puts apples on their heads while the other tries to shoot the apples with AR-15s with bump-stocks from 30 yards. Then switch sides.
2809 2018-02-21 15:23:53 I suggest we outlaw assault rifles and let people have as many bump stocks as they want.
2810 2018-02-21 15:23:47 But it was OK with you when Obama legalized gun stocks wasn't it??
2811 2018-02-21 15:23:37 I agree that it MIGHT, we don't know. I want to go to the root cause and address how we deal with mental illness in our communities. We probably don't need bump stocks or 30 round clips but if we take care of mental illness none of that will matter.
2812 2018-02-21 15:23:27 a chimpanzee became the 22nd most successful money manager on Wall St after choosing stocks by throwing darts at a board of 133 tech companies
2813 2018-02-21 15:23:25 It's minimal but it's a start. Remember what happened after Vegas with the bump stocks?
2814 2018-02-21 15:23:22 would you rather it run at 2 or 3%?:if your holding bonds you want 2%. the audacity of bond traders to indicate that once the 10yr gets to 3% retirees & pension funds will lock in rates & abandon stocks: really? If you have $1 mil that’s $30k. Try to live on that! @cvpayne
2815 2018-02-21 15:23:17 Good work maybe these psu bank stocks SHOULD be in F&O so that price discovery happens quickly, rather than death by a thousand cuts!
2816 2018-02-21 15:23:11 So is there another app out there like Twitter maybe somebody needs to invent so we can all go over there and then and then tweeters Stocks can be flushed down the toilet
2817 2018-02-21 15:23:07 After researching bump stocks, I have concluded that they are not that big of a deal and could care less that Trump did what he did. Now if he goes further then bump stocks., I will call him out on that.
2818 2018-02-21 15:23:05 Do we need bump stocks?  I'm a gun owner and i personally don't need them. Just do it the right way.  Get a trust, class a license and then have full auto.
2819 2018-02-21 15:22:41 Didn't Twitter just make YUGE money off of stocks ? Hmm 
2820 2018-02-21 15:22:29 Ok so better background checks, no bump stocks & then I dont want to hear about weakening our 2nd amendment rights again for 100yrs. Consider this issue solved.

2823 2018-02-21 15:22:23 1st off DOJ doesn't handle bump stocks legality, that's ATF. They have ruled bump stocks & gat cranks as accessories they don't have jurisdiction over. It would take legislation to make them illegal. After Vegas massacre a bipartisan bill was done but Rep refused to bring it to

2825 2018-02-21 15:22:21 #WednesdayWisdom @RealDonaldTrump floating possible action on bump stocks shows how the public get 'diverted'. #GOP makes it look like something will happen--and then nothing ever happens. Scam.
2826 2018-02-21 15:22:08 I've directed AG Sessions to write regulations banning bump stocks! But gun owners need not worry! TWICE as many regulations will be REPEALED!
2827 2018-02-21 15:22:02 My son, who knows much more about firearms, say banning bump stocks is as close doing absolutely nothing as you can get and still look like you’re doing something.

@gwcarpenter #CFP2020 #CFPreality
2829 2018-02-21 15:21:50 Trump's plan to outlaw "bump stocks" is a pathetic scam. There is only a small chance of saving lives.  There are other more important measures, like improving background checks, limiting magazine size, and stopping gun sales without any background checks. NRA has a true friend.
2830 2018-02-21 15:21:42 Very brave of @realDonaldTrump to express his desire to ban bump stocks, one of the only things the NRA is wiling to concede.
2831 2018-02-21 15:21:06 Trump wants to be the originator of banning bump stocks and will be very reluctant to pass the ban on to someone in the Congress unless he orders it. No principle, just power and ego.
2832 2018-02-21 15:21:04 When doing your executive order on bump stocks you just gave the liberals the power they needed over you. Now this will escalate with them as they keep pusshing for gun control. This is a society problem not a gun problem.
2833 2018-02-21 15:20:28 As a republican gun owner, and a hunter, I'm not in favor of bump stocks either.

2841 2018-02-21 15:18:54 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @scrowder @GunOwners Please, Pres. Trump, don't abandon our 2nd Amendment Rights and those who support and elected you.  If you can stop with Bump Stocks, we can deal with that, but an "Assault Weapon" ban is a DEAL breaker and stab in our backs!
2842 2018-02-21 15:18:46 Banning bump stocks is nothing. Go ahead and do it, but it will not slow or stop the #NeverAgain movement. These kids are not taking crumbs from the @NRA, they are kicking ass, taking names & forcing politicians out of jobs. This will not stop until assault rifles are BANNED

2849 2018-02-21 15:17:04 I actually am okay with banning bump stocks. I understand that you could get one somehow or even 3d print one if you wanted to, but i dont see the point to them.

2866 2018-02-21 15:14:05 Yeah because you saying you want to ban bump stocks which you can't do without Congress. And we have a republican Congress who takes money from the NRA so don't see that happening and maybe you should ban assault weapons no civilian needs them. He didn't use BUMP stocks
2867 2018-02-21 15:14:01 And copped some stocks 
2868 2018-02-21 15:13:59 @CNN , @MSNBC If bump stocks get banned, how long until someone makes a vest or harness you wear with a bump device built into it?...  you can then use it on any semi auto rifle, not just AR’s...   folks will find a way around ANY new laws.

2870 2018-02-21 15:13:36 Because The #NRAIsATerroristOrganization ALLOWED him to put bumper stocks on the table right after Vegas, but is just now mentioning the "possibility" of maybe doing away with them. Nowhere near enough.

2872 2018-02-21 15:13:21 Banning Bump stocks as a gun compromise is like offering someone with cancer a Tylenol. Media, stop promoting this as some sort of "compromise". It's a slap in the face.

2881 2018-02-21 15:12:33 Banning bump stocks is just slapping a bandaid over a spurting artery. Our country is bleeding out & it’s blood of our kids. 
These kids will be the ones to institute change & deserve all of our support.
2882 2018-02-21 15:12:31 Dealing with "bump-stocks" to help with gun violence, is like changing the air freshener hanging from the mirror, and calling it a complete restoration of the automobile.

2885 2018-02-21 15:11:49 @realDonaldTrump You told the Justice Department to ban bump stocks & other gun modifications. You will be a 1 term President for back stabbing the people who helped elect you & the 2nd Amendment. We will not forget the betrayal!
2886 2018-02-21 15:11:46 The 2nd doesn't protect the right to keep and bare accessories to firearms. I am pro 2nd but there is no need for bump stocks other than for mass damage. Give a little to give a little.
2887 2018-02-21 15:11:36 Sir, we can count on YOU to make a common sense decision on how to make things better in every arena. Your ideas regarding gun laws are common sense, I agree with whatever YOU decide.  Bump stocks have no business in our world, any more than machine guns do.

2892 2018-02-21 15:10:47 An outright ban is impractical and would likely have an inverse effect.  I am willing to consider giving up high capacity mags, bump stocks, etc. to get concessions like prescription drug reform. SSRI drugs being should not be  given out like candy at the receptionist desk.
2893 2018-02-21 15:10:24 Like was done in MA right after horrific shooting in Las Vegas. Legislation introduced,passed,signed. Bump stocks banned in MA.

2904 2018-02-21 15:08:59 @chucktodd Trump wants to ban bump stocks. One positive step IF it ever happens. Trump has a terrible habit of talking a lot & doing little when time for the rubber to meet the road Remainder of critical issues like universal background check & assault weapons still not happening
2905 2018-02-21 15:08:44 tired: ban bump stocks

wired: fucking ban all guns
2906 2018-02-21 15:08:41 Accessories were not included in the 2nd. As gun lovers we have to be able to give and take, that's what a functioning society is. I love my AR and they would have to kill me to take it, but I'm willing to give up bump stocks since it's not really a useful accessory.

2910 2018-02-21 15:08:06 @davidfaber
@carlquintanilla I respectfully disagree with the notion that stocks are safe until interest rates go much higher (based on history). The problem with that analysis is that private and public debt is very large against the past, so headwind of rates much lower.
2911 2018-02-21 15:07:58 This illuminates a wider issue in the gun debate, where gun enthusiasts try to prove they know more about the subject than anyone else. File under "Bump stocks aren't automatic".
2912 2018-02-21 15:07:56 High momentum stocks deliver incredible short-term returns a few times a year. Learn to recognize those markets & be aggressive during them.
2913 2018-02-21 15:07:23 Trump to take steps to ban bump stocks baby steps little Donnie,   YOU NEED TO STOP THE NRA FROM PAYING OFF GOP AND DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE ABOUT OUR PPL/CHILDREN BEING SLAUGHTERED
2914 2018-02-21 15:07:07 any asshole can come up with stats and bs for stocks...it is like these assholes with all there baseball analylitcs......rediculous to listen to these fvcks   wonder what all these assholes who have been buying bonds over last couple of years
2915 2018-02-21 15:07:07 The NRA has reached too far - There is no legitimate reason to own an assault rifle, bump stocks and mega clips, except mass murder. They are being used monthly to massacre our school children
2916 2018-02-21 15:07:05 Schumer on Trump/bump stocks: "The only way to close this loophole permanently is legislation. He should call on Congress to pass Senator Feinstein’s bill to ban bump stocks, rather than just draft memos."
2917 2018-02-21 15:06:46 @WAHouseDems @WaStateDems what is the status of SB 5992? The voters want to see a ban on bump stocks in WA, at the very least. #waleg

2919 2018-02-21 15:06:30 Ok I get that.. How do you feel about banning bump stocks or other means of making a gun an automatic?
2920 2018-02-21 15:06:17 Weird. I've read veterans that are very familiar with the weapon and say the opposite. They say it's essentially the M4 missing one fire rate rarely used (that bump stocks restore) and another that is widely used but not necessary for being excessively lethal in a crowd.

2923 2018-02-21 15:05:50 Schumer criticizes Trump approach on guns, asks him to call for bump stocks legislation. "He should call on Congress to pass Senator Feinstein’s bill to ban bump stocks, rather than just draft memos."

Also calls to remove concealed carry from Fix NICS bill
2924 2018-02-21 15:05:21 I’m all for banning bump stocks but announcing it in response to the Parkland slaughter is like Mary Richards applying for a job.

“What religion are you?”
“Mr Grant…it's illegal to ask questions like that in a job interview."
“So call the cops. Are you married?”
“Presbyterian.”

2938 2018-02-21 15:03:32 No one is going to miss bump stocks. They suck. The problem with an idea like banning mods is in the way it will be codified, which can only infringe upon 2A. This is worse than you might think.

I would propose at least an age of 21 for women and 25 for men to purchase and own a firearm.  Lets let those frontal lobes develope.
ARs and other semi autos should remain and NOT be banned.
2956 2018-02-21 15:01:34 Obama failed to take any action in his 8 years president Trump has started to address the issue with banning bump stocks and will come up with a policy to protect our children in schools and we applaud his action!

2966 2018-02-21 14:59:47 Why is Trump enacting a bump stock ban via executive order? If anything, that's something Congress should pass.

And I'm open to talk about a bump stock ban, if it ONLY bans bump stocks and nothing else. Automatic firearms are already banned, so there's a logical argument that...
2967 2018-02-21 14:59:31 Trump wants to ban bump stocks and ban high schoolers from buying guns. This is more than Obama did in 8 years.

2969 2018-02-21 14:59:09 The increasing sales of bump stocks reflects the increasing worries about the Congress getting ready to ban them: its the “Get ‘em now, while you still can” mentality.

2977 2018-02-21 14:57:40 .. these two words [birth control] sum up our whole philosophy... It means the release and cultivation of the better elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction, of defective stocks --
2978 2018-02-21 14:57:30 a lot of stocks shot up to resistance and then stalled
2979 2018-02-21 14:57:29 It's great that you're finally putting a ban on bump stocks! But you're one mass murder behind! And it should have been done long ago. Why you putting a ban on bump stocks it would be a good time to put a ban on semi-automatic weapons!

2984 2018-02-21 14:57:11 Concerning bump stocks don't give the democrats a win by allowing their bill to be voted on. Instead have republicans develop a federal plan to  ban bump stocks and implement funding to harden school security allowing State implementation. With federal oversight.
@realDonaldTrump
2985 2018-02-21 14:56:54 Yes, it is. And now we have a nation of hateful nitwits with bump stocks.

3006 2018-02-21 14:54:30 Again I agree. I'm not saying ban guns all together because it's been proven over and over again banning anything completely in America is pointless. Just ban unnecessary shit. Bump stocks are like a 1 step escalators. There's just no fucking point and unnecessary.

3016 2018-02-21 14:52:25 Exactly. Banning AR-15s may or may not help in some very small way. It’s common sense gun law tightening (bump stocks, random background checks on ammo purchases), mental health, school security, etc. Even then, it’ll help - not solve.

3019 2018-02-21 14:52:08 It's funny, I just learned that it was teenagers that demanded the right to vote at 18 instead of 21. Nixon actually was the President that changes that. So, I guess Trump's good deed will be banning bump stocks.
3020 2018-02-21 14:52:03 So that is were we misunderstand each other.  No one is suggesting taking away anyone's ability to defend themselves.  If you are competent gun owner/handler a 9mm is all that is needed.  No justification for assault weapons or things like bump stocks.
3021 2018-02-21 14:52:00 A good start with bump stocks, age increased and most importantly 48 hour wait. I am nieve about Gun Control even though my family hunts!
3022 2018-02-21 14:52:00 Bump stocks do make guns fire automatically as they enable the finger to become part of a quicker firing mechanism.
3023 2018-02-21 14:51:55 At least the president might ban bump stocks...it's a start. Only hope they can make it hard for the idiots out there to buy anything other than a glock. If that. Be leniant towards the ppl that actually hunt for sport I guess
3024 2018-02-21 14:51:41 At least President Trump is doing what Obama had never mentioned : bump stocks ban
3025 2018-02-21 14:51:36 One reason he doesn’t is that millions upon millions of NRA dollars are at stake. He’ll go after low-hanging fruit the NRA doesn’t really care about (like bump stocks), demand great credit for that, and stay away from real issues like ...
3026 2018-02-21 14:51:27 Their stocks have finally gone up after years of being in the teens. I think Trump is the number one reason why they have gone up.
3027 2018-02-21 14:51:14 Hey Brandon Minoff, if there were gun control, ie AK47s off the market to the general public, bump stocks off the market, more thorough background checks, not selling firearms to minors, then you would not need to tell the media they are using this tragedy 2 push 4 gun control
3028 2018-02-21 14:51:11 In the past two days, Trump has proposed raising the age to buy a gun and banning bump stocks.

Should we be suspicious?
3029 2018-02-21 14:50:51 What is the over under that the president and Congress will do nothing about bump stocks? I'd put the odds very much in the favor of do nothing, we only have years of observational data, but this time will be different, oh look NRA money, nevermind. We have no reason to believe.
3030 2018-02-21 14:50:28 Also, he didn't really 'ban bump stocks'. If he were sincere he'd support the Congressional bill presented after Las Vegas and make it law. Instead he refers it to the DOJ which will ultimately defer it to congress...wasting years while bump stock sales will increase meanwhile.

3033 2018-02-21 14:50:19 You lost me at "spraying a crowd." Banning bump stocks is not pointless.
3034 2018-02-21 14:50:16 Massachusetts banned bump stocks feb 1, turn them into the cops or face charges if caught. welp, they have 4 of them so far. only 4.  and IMO, if you are dumb enough to turn your guns over to cops then you don't need to have guns.
3035 2018-02-21 14:50:13 We don't need bump stocks, But we do need ar 15 defensive rifles, To many loony liberals and democrats to not have them
3036 2018-02-21 14:50:09 What the actual fuck? No he's not. He couldn't give a shit about the constitution and even if he did, bump stocks aren't a constitutional issue.
3037 2018-02-21 14:49:56 Plus, it's possible the gameplan is that the DoJ will say, "Well, with bump stocks, we've determined that's congress' responsibility to pass a law which we can then enforce," which is essentially what happened with DACA. Executive branch threw it to congress, where DACA died.
3038 2018-02-21 14:49:52 We disagree on this point, but that's ok.  I hope we can agree that limiting bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and requiring background checks are at least worth considering.

3042 2018-02-21 14:48:57 Guess you must be pretty disappointed that your cult leader Trumpy is recommending bump stocks be banned. Next he’ll be banning guns. Will you still idolise him then? You do realise he stands for nothing?
3043 2018-02-21 14:48:56 That may be. While banning bump stocks is common sense, it's a paltry response to gun violence in the US. Would you agree?
3044 2018-02-21 14:48:21 I'm pretty sure she went into extensive detail about him wanting to ban bump stocks. Guess that doesn't count. 
3045 2018-02-21 14:48:13 Wasn't he a all chummy with Sessions over bump stocks yesterday?  Bizarre
3046 2018-02-21 14:48:10 @realDonaldTrump don't know if you're aware, people have already figured out how to print guns out on a 3D printer. People have also figured out how to 3D print bump stocks. We can't uninvent guns, laws are not going to stop murderers
3047 2018-02-21 14:48:10 Have you watched his voice today!! Banning bump stocks and is arranging meetings on solitutions for school protection.  Try to watch something other than CNN OR ABC OR NBC!
3048 2018-02-21 14:47:56 Don't be a sucker for bump stocks because that's where it will end. Bump stocks had nothing to do with MSD!! #MSNBC
3049 2018-02-21 14:47:42 So how does this prevent black market bump stocks? Last I knew China makes them too, so they are going to stop now? Honestly all you morons who want shit banned have never been on the dark web, nor realize the US Post Office delivers illegal things everyday from there.
3050 2018-02-21 14:47:41 I wish buying stocks was as easy as buying a lotto ticket.
All a dis fancy banking rigmarole probably not even necessary, just wah stress people out.
3051 2018-02-21 14:47:37 did you guys get out nice and easy?
3052 2018-02-21 14:47:33 I spent so much time trying to explain to Pro-Gun folks that there are some things that can be done to current legislation to help prevent this. I was met with hatred and denial. Then Trump says no Bump Stocks and Stricter BG checks, they're like "well I GUESS SOOO..." 
3053 2018-02-21 14:47:17 Good point. It’s more that I want him to stop being on Twitter all day. Though if he could actually get work done on banning bump stocks and tightening background checks like he claims, I would actually praise him for that.
3054 2018-02-21 14:46:56 You really should read what Easy D just did. He said investigate if they have the authority to ban bump stocks. Guess what, we already did that and they said no. Doing something great would be working with Congress to write a law that gave them the authority to do that.
3055 2018-02-21 14:46:49 Just this: any seasoned gun enthusiast is wont to instruct you how "arbitrary" and "meaningless" the existing regulations on bump stocks and many other areas re "modifications" actually are.

3058 2018-02-21 14:46:18 I doubt he knows what bump stocks are.
3059 2018-02-21 14:46:08 Trump just banned bump stocks (a bump stock makes a semi-automatic firearm 100% automatic) so don’t say he isn’t doing anything about guns or gun control
3060 2018-02-21 14:46:05 Why are you restricting bump stocks. Now criminals will have them. You are now a politician. Just lost my vote .

3062 2018-02-21 14:45:53 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks, assualt rifles, universal background checks, gun shows. It’s not hard.
3063 2018-02-21 14:45:36 @JeffreyToobin do we have any reason to believe that the only reason trump has made these announcements of bump stocks, background checks, etc., only because he knows repubs won’t budge so he can then blame them? Nope. That’s probs his angle
3064 2018-02-21 14:45:27 @AZHouseGOP No vote on bump stocks because video games??? That's like no action on opioids because Tylenol.
3065 2018-02-21 14:45:17 Gun control by way of banning all assault type weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks all need to be banned from public ownership.  End of story.
3066 2018-02-21 14:45:11 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase.

3067 2018-02-21 14:45:09 So this proffered GOP solution is "form over substance" and will not even withstand Judicial scrutiny, much less matter since god-knows-how-many bump stocks (1) are already in the stream of commerce and (2) these MILITARY GRADE GUNS kill just as well without bump stocks.

3070 2018-02-21 14:44:43 And common sense policies that protect citizens rights under 2nd Amend & protect all of our lives-restrictions on assault weapons, ban large ammo clips, ban bump stocks, illegal to sell guns to mentally ill, children, terriorist watch, domestic abusers. Make It Happen

3072 2018-02-21 14:44:32 You have yet to even acknowledge the last Florida gun slaughter. Change your voting record, your voting record is despicable. After Newtown, you voted against gun control. Bump stocks is not the only answer.
3073 2018-02-21 14:44:20 Bump stocks’re meaningless, nobody uses them. And he’s not giving amnesty, he’s using their narrative against them. No Trump supporter that I know’s going 2abandon Trump. We all understand the bigger picture.I’m a long term Investor, I don’t freak out when a stock goes down
3074 2018-02-21 14:44:10 Unfortunately, this sounds like the kind of thing the #AZLeg would do as well as evident by their recent vote on bump stocks.

3080 2018-02-21 14:43:27 The Second Amendment does not preclude making certain kinds of guns, ammunition and equipment illegal, e.g. machine guns, silencers, armor piercing ammunition, bump stocks.  We should outlaw assault rifles!

3083 2018-02-21 14:43:12 Oh please.

What "meaningful difference" is "the Federal Government banning bump stocks" going to do when, as here, such State Action will INEVITABLY be OVERTURNED via Judicial Review as a VIOLATION of FEDERALISM? It is UP TO THE U.S. STATES to REGULATE their OWN gun laws.
3084 2018-02-21 14:43:09 No. He knows he can’t ban bump stocks. It’s the least he can do and yet he knows it can’t be done. Pure CYA politics.
3085 2018-02-21 14:43:06 Options trading has tripled my “dividend “ returns. Here’s the interesting thing. When I have been assigned a stock (assigned put) I have made even more money selling the stock on the open market within 30 days! Key is to work with high quality stocks/companies
3086 2018-02-21 14:42:54 @realDonaldTrump The FBI new about the Parkland shooting months before. It had nothing to do with bump stocks. I'm all for trading bump stocks for suppressors BUT not giving up both. If you want to fix the problem of mass shootings, fix the FBI. PLEASE fix the FBI.
3087 2018-02-21 14:42:51 So they're bound and determined to ban bump stocks the best I can say is ok watch how absolutely no lives are saved because of this.
3088 2018-02-21 14:42:48 hes going to pass stronger background checks and ban bump stocks, which I can support
3089 2018-02-21 14:42:16 What what what will the Left have left when President Trump does what Obama, W & Clinton refused to do - use his influence to bolster background checks, end the loopholes & support a ban on bump stocks & automatic weapons?  This doesn’t get any better!
3090 2018-02-21 14:42:10 The President doesn't make law. He sees that what Congress legislates is carried out. I am tired of rule by Executive Order.
If bump stocks go, the Congress must speak.

3098 2018-02-21 14:41:09 Banning bump stocks is a positive step, but it’s too late for the victims in Las Vegas. And it wouldn’t have saved any of the victims in #Parkland. The goal shouldn’t be just revising our gun laws after massacres, it should be real action to prevent them from ever happening.
3099 2018-02-21 14:41:08 The NRA has approved Trump issuing a ban on bump stocks as a sacrificial lamb to the outraged populace.  Let's accept this ban and push forward to further gun legislation reform.

High velocity guns, read what they do to a body.
3110 2018-02-21 14:39:45 I have no problem legislating bump stocks, purchase & ownership age to 21, machine guns, and magazine capacity to 10 or 12 rounds.
3111 2018-02-21 14:39:43 No. Bump stocks are not guns. Strengthening background checks , improving coordination, compliance with reporting those who should not have guns, and improving mental health access for all are common sense not gun control as defined by Libs.

3114 2018-02-21 14:38:43 , loin d'être inutile, ce fut concret et pertinent.

Même si l'EO n'était pas parfait, transcendant, le révoquer n'était aucunement une avancée. 

La requête de Trump au DOJ concernant les 'bump stocks' est de l'esbroufe. Une telle législation concerne le congrès.
3115 2018-02-21 14:38:39 Really?  Let's see, I am a @realDonaldTrump supporter.  Yet, I do NOT agree with getting rid of bump stocks.  They help those with physical handicaps use their firearm.  But hey, who cares about facts right?
3116 2018-02-21 14:38:28 Too little too late. Bum stocks had nothing to do with Parkland shooting. This should have been done easily after Las Vegas. Trump’s just trying to divert away from real action.

3124 2018-02-21 14:37:25 Bump stocks are purely novelty items, the reality is any firearm enthusiast views them as pointless and will agree that even in the vegas scenario considerably more damage would have been done without them... there's a reason our military got rid of full auto m16...

3126 2018-02-21 14:37:15 Still waiting for the NRO opinion piece to appear on Trump’s (vs Congress’) authority to regulate bump stocks.
3127 2018-02-21 14:36:49 Banning bump-stocks is a really STUPID move. 

Trump should be focused on repealing Obamacare, building a wall, reducing immigration, de-funding NPR & PBS & Planned Parenthood, ending NAFTA, etc., instead of screwing his base on gun rights.

3139 2018-02-21 14:35:35 Thanks Calum, I appreciate the reply. My local store no longer stocks the turkey rashers.
3140 2018-02-21 14:35:29 Me. He's finally willing to look at maybe banning bump stocks. He won't even commit to doing the least amount possible.
3141 2018-02-21 14:35:24 Don't need bump stocks, can do the same thing with a belt loop, whats next "Ban Pants" movement led by 14-year-olds who can't change a tire or cook for themselves?
3142 2018-02-21 14:35:11 Stocks open slightly higher, Dow +40 points.
3143 2018-02-21 14:34:51 Invest in stocks!
3144 2018-02-21 14:34:43 If it were that easy, then there’s no point to have bump stocks, right? #logicfail

If it makes it easier for a mass murderer, and the only benefit is to ammosexual losers, then there’s no legitimate reason to keep it.

3146 2018-02-21 14:33:41 Congratulations and well done Twitter, Alphabet and Facebook for those great stock Rises.. RISE UP TECH STOCKS.
3147 2018-02-21 14:33:39 trump just banned bump stocks that turn weapons into automatic weapons more than Obama did in 8 years.
3148 2018-02-21 14:33:25 Come on Twitter your stocks are finally going up- I think it's because of Trump.
Why would you sensor it now????

3150 2018-02-21 14:33:21 LOL... Yes. Never underestimate how cheap stocks are each day at 930am... at least for 15 minutes.
3151 2018-02-21 14:33:11 Aren't you suspicious of the timing? This could have been done soon after the Vegas tragedy. This was a political decision to make it look like republicans care about gun safety. Bump stocks was an easy one to give up. More needs to be done and they'll be against it all the way.
3152 2018-02-21 14:32:59 I was offended by your statement on @morningmika today.  We were building shanty towns on the quad in the 80's.  Remember this ditty:
Trustees, you know,
South African stocks have got to go,
Trustees, you know...etc
3153 2018-02-21 14:32:33 Bump stocks are a no brainer. No credit is deserved for that smoke screen!

Ban military style wepons!
3154 2018-02-21 14:32:06 Not get rid of guns; just restrict the access to them, especially to assault weapons and semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks. Enact and enforce gun safety laws, gun purchases not permitted for folks w/ psychological issues, domestic violence & physical assault convictions.
3155 2018-02-21 14:32:05 soon i'll play with stocks
3156 2018-02-21 14:31:38 Bump stocks? Bump stocks are so "Vegas Massacre." Trump needs to get with the times. That will NEVER be enough now.
3157 2018-02-21 14:31:05 Breaking (9:30 AM EST): Stocks open slightly higher ahead of Fed minutes... -- CNBC
3158 2018-02-21 14:31:02 They don’t want to take your guns James. They just want tighter gun laws... such as raising the minimum age to purchase guns, banning bump stocks and more thorough background checks. Many people support the second amendment but just want to help make this country a bit safer 
3159 2018-02-21 14:30:49 Assault weapons are already banned in America.  Please learn the difference between assault rifles and normal rifles. Bump stocks should be banned, absolutely.
3160 2018-02-21 14:30:44 Actually, I don't think he banned bump stocks.
3161 2018-02-21 14:30:40 President Trump Makes Move to Ban Bump Stock Devices Used in Vegas Shooting. Vegas Shooter had bump stocks in the room but according to the media he never used them. They're useless anyway ban them it's about Mental Health not guns
3162 2018-02-21 14:30:15 No, it's a semi-auto rifle with a modification.

A) In order to be automatic, the gun itself needs to chamber the next round

B) I want bump stocks banned, and it sounds like they will be. So you should be happy, right?
3163 2018-02-21 14:30:09 Bump stocks are silly accessories.  They decrease accuracy and increase ammunition consumption. That's why the Army gave up full auto for soldiers.
You get the same effect by hooking your thumb in a belt loop.
Throwing a starving dog a rubber bone.
3164 2018-02-21 14:30:08 Is that only me or happening with every1 all my pf stocks volumes have gone down n hardly moving 3-4rs range in last weeks. @indian_stockss @Nifty11413Mode
3165 2018-02-21 14:30:05 Bump stocks are in the news.. did you know they were designed 2 assist ppl w/ fine motor skills issues? Say a like vet that lost his fingers. That design was perverted. What shoulda happened was a permit for a bump stock like a handicap parking permit.  I.e. better law
3166 2018-02-21 14:29:24 I hope gun control advocates follow the GOP playbook and force concessions in the name of “compromise” before getting right back on message.

Bump stocks gone? Thanks. Not enough. Now let’s shrink the clips.

Reload time ratio increased? Thanks. Not enough. Ban the AR-15 class...
3167 2018-02-21 14:29:08 Ban assault -or assault like- rifles, ban bump stocks,
Have a universal background check system,
Waiting period of 72 hours if approved,
Limit mag limit,
3168 2018-02-21 14:29:06 1. Trump has proposed that bump stocks be banned through regulations.  It's a good step but it's not nearly enough.  The ATF may lack the authority to ban bump stocks.  #GunReformNow
3169 2018-02-21 14:28:17 GE, what a house of pain. Took a shot at it again under $20. Had to sell. Investors have to keep an eye on stocks like GE, UAA, IBM. The laggards in a secular bull market can become leaders in next transition. Keep an eye on what isn't working (L small UAA, IBM)
3170 2018-02-21 14:27:57 I think I’m going to purchase some stocks today 
3171 2018-02-21 14:27:49 *wispers* bump stocks are for entertainment, they actually suck if you need to hit something. the gun literally bounces around under full auto making aiming difficult.. they are a novelty item
3172 2018-02-21 14:27:22 He did sign an order for regulation that bans bump stocks though. Which, if we're being honest, bad absolutely zero to do with this shooting, or the vast majority of them.
3173 2018-02-21 14:26:50 Do you support the ban on bump stocks?
3174 2018-02-21 14:26:44 These easy gives on #GunControl like ban on bump stocks/age requirements are fine, but we need to stay laser focused on assault weapons, high capacity ammunition clips, background checks, wait time, loophole closures, licensing, no sell if on ‘no fly’ list or mental health watch.
3175 2018-02-21 14:26:29 The sheep are afraid and the wolves are hungry. #guncontrol can be improved: 6 cartridge magazines max, no devices to subvert current laws like bump stocks. Fix society’s disconnect and culture of instant gratification
3176 2018-02-21 14:26:22 #EPFO declares 8.55 % interest rate for 2017-18, lower than 8.65 % for 2016-17. Already low interest rate in FD, #LTCG on stocks/mutual funds!
3177 2018-02-21 14:26:19 Amazing! Over and over again! 
Why is sold out? I don't care if you have a billions of items on stocks, all is sold out, so do trillions items  first I can login after 7 hours. It's no enough your effort. This is worldwide  we need bigger stock
3178 2018-02-21 14:26:08 As a veteran and a hunter I ask that your support of assault-style weapons, large magazine capacity, bumper stocks, gun sales loopholes, and guns for the mentally needs to stop. Pistols and shotguns are best for defense, and rifles for hunting. Quit trying to play army like kids!
3179 2018-02-21 14:26:05 Don't get too excited. Trump said he was asking Justice for a proposal against bump stocks, nothing else.
3180 2018-02-21 14:26:03 rump repealed obamas order to ban guns from mentally ill.  gop votes AGAIBSR every measure-bump stocks, background checks, assault weapons, national registers on computers. all that gop against. hint-so is the nra
3181 2018-02-21 14:26:01 Billy Graham and bump stocks both in the same week
3182 2018-02-21 14:25:46 Democrats don’t want to bad Bump Stocks. They want to gut the 2nd amendment & ban all gun ownership.
3183 2018-02-21 14:25:41 Obama tried to take our guns yet allowed The Bump Stocks., and what do you know hah....LAS VEGAS Massacre! Obamas plan!He needs to die!
3184 2018-02-21 14:25:07 Bump stocks are a no.
3185 2018-02-21 14:25:03 @JayWeber3 Bump stocks were based on BS. They were never really intended for the disabled as sold to ATF. They are a workaround to attain near auto experience.
3186 2018-02-21 14:25:00 If banning bump stocks is our only answer to all of these tragic shootings we will have failed our kids again
3187 2018-02-21 14:24:35 Never understood this. That even the most ardent gun rights legislators haven’t banned bump stocks already is crazy  - only makes their side look worse. I’d like to consider a domestic violence temp/probationary ban - far too many are this situation and obvious.
3188 2018-02-21 14:24:32 Is anyone going to tell this illigitimate POS that congress passes laws and a president signs them.
Regulations to outlaw bump stocks coming real soon?
The only thing this gopig congress does fast is pass tax scam bills.

3190 2018-02-21 14:24:01 Also Trump is trying to show concern about the shooting by asking Sessions to investigate bump stocks as well as determining if something further can be done for background checks and mental care. Whether you agree or not, at least he is trying to take action unlike Obama.
3191 2018-02-21 14:23:48 PRESIDENT TRUMP, I HOPE THIS IS FAKE NEWS, BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW AT THIS MOMENT.  I JUST READ AN ARTICLE YOU ARE BANNING BUMP STOCKS, AND THIS IS THE FIRST THING YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, AND I AM TOTALLY AGAINST YOU DOING THIS.
3192 2018-02-21 14:23:30 Trump is moving to ban bump stocks. How long ago was Vegas? He moves fast. That ought to be a huge help--banning bump stocks. I know it's one step at a time. But bump stocks; that's the best you can do? SMH.
3193 2018-02-21 14:23:25 Interesting how James Flanagan of Gann Global is calling for a move below the December 2016 low, before a 100%+ move in the metals stocks. Could this lower low be a full on capitulation down to roughly Gold $1100? I’m increasingly thinking yes with what’s going on in USD/JPY...
3194 2018-02-21 14:23:24 Why did you direct Sessions to ban bump stocks? Isn't that Congress who makes laws? I've been a loyal supporter since way before you even announced your run. And still am. Bit not happy with any infringement on my 2nd! #MAGA

3203 2018-02-21 14:21:38 Listened up to about 12 minute mark. Need to respectfully disagree with you re: bump stocks. Those specifically aren’t the issue. Triggers, magazines, etc are all under consideration for new restrictions. See recent @GunOwners statement.

3206 2018-02-21 14:21:14 He could actually ban bump stocks like he proposed doing yesterday instead of denying he said it two days from now.

3209 2018-02-21 14:20:30 And how would that have helped in Las Vegas, Orlando, etc? How about instead of focusing on bump stocks, we actually focus on protecting our children? As long as they're stuck in Gun Free Zones all day, they remain at risk.
3210 2018-02-21 14:20:24 Agreed! There is NO reason 2 own an AR-15 unless you like killing a lot of people in short period of time. We can do more: outlaw 1) AR-15s & other weapons of war, 2) bump stocks, 3) high-capacity magazines (10 bullet max)! Then do buyback progr & get as many off streets as poss!
3211 2018-02-21 14:20:05 @SRuhle The reason nothing got done on bump stocks and background checks is on Obama. He had control of both chambers but, you want to put it all on Trump and Republicans because you're just a little girl who strangely gets a camera and mic to spew nonsense and hate. #MSNBC
3212 2018-02-21 14:19:59 I agree. But I still think, criminal or not, no one needs bumps stocks for any type of reason.
3213 2018-02-21 14:19:55 . @realDonaldTrump it’s been one week since #Parkland. Bump stocks are not enough. Every person who dies as the result of a gun from this moment forward is blood on your hands. Your party is trying to undermine the kids? Shame on you. #NeverAgain #wecallBS

Hello President Trump.  Why not designate bump stocks and other converting mechanisms, class 3 items which are in same category as automatic weapons themselves.  Real hard to get.  One can duplicate bmp stocks with their thumbs in belt buckles anyway.
Keep on helping us.
3219 2018-02-21 14:18:02 And  you know most people care nothing about a ban on bump stocks, because that ban is meaningless. It's a feel good law. A bump stock is not needed to accomplish what the device does for a shooter. It can be done with a belt loop, a nylon strap,etc.Are they going to outlaw those

3221 2018-02-21 14:17:53 Good morning, young adults.  You are being heard!  The President has spoken about raising the age limit & banning bump stocks.  Your voices are being heard.  Ignore the awful haters, and march on.  #LettersToStoneman
3222 2018-02-21 14:17:45 The fact the Donald Trump banned bump stocks is proof that protesting works
3223 2018-02-21 14:17:43 So why are bump stocks still legal TODAY. They can spit out more death than that OLD Tommy gun ever did AND it's illegal!  Bump stock devices which can modify a semi-automatic rifle to fire as many as 800 bullets per minute. And they still sell 100 round clips TODAY. Get Smart!
3224 2018-02-21 14:17:36 It is an outcry that is Just about the stocks that have no legal use and OUR PRESIDENT is lessening.
3225 2018-02-21 14:17:33 If Trump or Congress bends to control freaks on bump stocks, there will be no end to their gun-eradication demands. Because of 2a they do this incrementally. Violent predators need disarming, NOT THE REST OF US.
3226 2018-02-21 14:17:31 before everyone talking about them constantly slidefire stocks were relatively obscure and not very successful as a product for years for reasons previously mentioned.
3227 2018-02-21 14:17:25 No they didn't because bump stocks do not turn a semi-automatic rifle into an automatic.

If they want to ban bump stocks, then pass a law.
3228 2018-02-21 14:17:21 Yah who!!!!!!!!!!! President does an emotional thing while Florida does the mature thing.. not about bump stocks it about school security change the NARRATIVE TRUMP.@realDonaldTrump
3229 2018-02-21 14:17:21 So Trump banned pump stocks. Because they turn semi weapons into automatic. Most pump stocks are pieces of shit and are pretty difficult to use for more than 3-7 shots. Not to mention the lack of accuracy. I’m totally fine with this I always thought it was as stupid mod anyways.
3230 2018-02-21 14:17:15 Conservative voter, YES. No gun till 21. Any trouble with the law, domestic violence, fighting, etc...no gun,(10 year clearance) Ban Bump stocks, maybe a special permit needed for AR-15. PASS CODE security clearance at all schools. A badge opens the doors. @foxandfriends

3232 2018-02-21 14:16:54 Dude. You were doing so well yesterday with your announcement on bump stocks.  Must you always undercut any positive message that you put out?  Seriously, Americans are concerned for your mental health.
3233 2018-02-21 14:16:45 Tomorrow, Net Neutrality is over. Now you can expect to pay more for Internet Content. Another fine example of Republican Leaders who want their Stocks to Bump.
3234 2018-02-21 14:16:33 Why he’s making noises about bump stocks - if he gave a shit he would have done this long ago.  Never mentioned banning assault weapons.  He only knows about being bought and sold.

3245 2018-02-21 14:15:23 Banning bump stocks, and, what I think is the most rational and effective action, protecting kids like we protect money. Or the airport - and that means no more 'gun free zones' at schools. You might as well paint a target on them.
3246 2018-02-21 14:15:21 Our Willow season is progressing nicely and we are busy, busy! If you're thinking of ordering please do so sooner rather than later as our stocks may not last until the end of March this year.
3247 2018-02-21 14:14:59 But.....but.....but.....what about the 2nd Amendment?  Everyone knows Thomas Jefferson had bump stocks specifically in mind. Also, when the government comes to my house with their tanks and Air Force, how can I defend myself without them????

3251 2018-02-21 14:14:25 Bump stocks should already be banned.

3252 2018-02-21 14:13:59 The question of whether Trump or Congress has the Constitutional authority to 'do something' about ________(fill in bump stocks for now) is crucial. Also important:  whether the gun-grabbers will ever stop at bump stocks, regardless of which branch of gov't imposes the ban. #NO

3256 2018-02-21 14:13:08 Stocks I’m watching today, $AMZN $ROKU $BIDU. I’m looking for new highs in AMZN, if the S&P500 can climb back over the 50day. Bidu needs to break its resistance at 248.50 and I’m looking for Roku to hit new highs after they report earnings tonight.
3257 2018-02-21 14:12:50 $ROKU the earnings after the bell today should be great !
Past holiday season and Super Bowl should reflect good sales

3258 2018-02-21 14:12:31 Someone please educate the president and all others bump stocks do not make a weapon into a machine gun
3259 2018-02-21 14:12:23 You say Ban bump stocks so guns can’t be turned into machine guns, so ban machine guns too
3260 2018-02-21 14:12:23 Talking about banning bump stocks, increasing the legal age to get the AR to 21, hopefully the FBI is looking at how they missed so badly on this guy, and more coming. Nothing? not hardly.
3261 2018-02-21 14:12:19 Why haven't you tweeted about your potential ban on bump stocks? It's sure to get you zero votes from the left and lose some from the right. It's a lose lose. Rethink it before it's too late.
3262 2018-02-21 14:12:11 I sure hope so, I've accumulated 200,000 shares. MJ stocks will be coming back with a vengeance as we get closer to the summer and I really think this is a bottom fish at this price,
3263 2018-02-21 14:12:02 Bump stocks need to go and then automatic weapons like they were outlawed when Pres. Reagan was shot. Does the @GOP think to act only when a President 's life is affected?!? #disgusting
3264 2018-02-21 14:11:38 Won’t get into the list mistakes of this regime but you are correct that Obama admin allowed bump stocks. They also issued sev exec orders promoting better gun control. Right now prohibition of bump stocks is just talk; we’ll see if legislation becomes a reality.
3265 2018-02-21 14:11:35 PLEASE SUPPORT:
Background checks on ALL purchases including gun shows!
Must be 21 to purchase a weapon- 18 years olds mental/criminal records are still sealed. 
Ban assault style weapons.
Limit size of magazines
Obviously bump stocks
1 of 2
3266 2018-02-21 14:11:25 Sometimes for work I come across some wild facebook groups. Anyway, some gun owners who voted for Trump are mad at Trump and regret their vote now that he has expressed he wants to regulate bump stocks
3267 2018-02-21 14:11:19 Yesterday it was bump stocks tomorrow it will be all firearms and you’ve played into the lefts hands
3268 2018-02-21 14:11:06 Watching the news, students marching on the capital in Florida. Again, guns have never killed anyone. Bump stocks haven't either. PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE. Liberal left using kids to push their agenda. Shameful.
3269 2018-02-21 14:11:03 1965 to August, 1982
DJIA traded between 700 and 1,000 with tiny exceptions             Strong GDP did not mark up stocks. Rising interest rates competed for investors. Money market funds at 18% to 21%. Long Govt bonds at 15%-16%. It was interesting.
3270 2018-02-21 14:10:30 Look at you going after bump stocks. Your a good boy, your a good little boy! Trump want a treat, come on buddy get the treat!!!
3271 2018-02-21 14:10:28 And let’s not pretend a 10 day wait and banning bump stocks would be enough. Crumbs from the @NRA. Not nearly enough.
3272 2018-02-21 14:10:24 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3273 2018-02-21 14:10:17 Yes they all  have known, it's always the person trying to stop the bad stuff who they make out to be the bad guy. It's clearly the dems because they knew and DID NOTHING, JUST LIKE GUN CONTROL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ALLOWEE BUMP STOCKS TO BE SOLD
3274 2018-02-21 14:09:52 A few trip stocks to watch out for today: $RCMH .0008
            $MSPC .0003
            $ILST .0007
3275 2018-02-21 14:09:29 Those features include: handle protruding beneath the gun, adjustable stock, flash hider, removable compensator, foregrip, etc.  bump stocks are banned and mags are limited to 15 rounds (soon to be 10)

3277 2018-02-21 14:09:15 Asit, I love reading your insightful reports, especially when it comes to infrastructure stocks.  Have you thought about potential of steel tariffs and effect on American steel and aluminum stocks?  Could be big, esp. X .  thanks!!
3278 2018-02-21 14:08:49 Banning “bump stocks” is akin to giving a tissue to someone dying of pneumonia. @BettyBowers @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @krassenstein

3280 2018-02-21 14:08:40 What other side is that?  The mass murderers with semi-automatics and bump stocks?
3281 2018-02-21 14:08:39 *your 

You’re wrong 

As another Canadian. We do not have to be elected to speak our thoughts.

Be quiet, troll, while others #standwiththekids who do not want to die so you can have a gun and bump stocks to compensate and murder en masse
3282 2018-02-21 14:08:30 DT could have won big by signing exec order to ban gun stocks, raise legal age to 21 AND starting a discussion of why do we need AR15's at all! For duck and deer? Prez too slow in making a stand. Geraldo, am with you ever since Willowbrook
3283 2018-02-21 14:08:19 Son modelos inferiors que ya dejaron de venderse acá; parece que stocks invendibles han sido exportado a países latinoamericanos.
3284 2018-02-21 14:08:15 what are you investing in? gimme tips/stocks/advice lol.
3285 2018-02-21 14:08:15 @SRuhle PLEEZE. WH report, you can't possibly believe Trump abt gun control of bump stocks or anything else. It's all PR. This is just ONE if the reasons TRUMP is the WORST PRES IN HISTORY! Last place...
3286 2018-02-21 14:08:13 Same bullshit going on here. I have been shadow blocked for over a year. Sell Twitter stocks while you can.  Something better is on the way .
3287 2018-02-21 14:08:12 @realDonaldTrump YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BAN BUMP STOCKS! FBI IS TO BLAME FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN FL!
3288 2018-02-21 14:07:51 Strengthening background checks, getting rid of bump stocks and guns that are automatic.
3289 2018-02-21 14:07:40 So, it appears #45 is circumventing the do-nothing Congress and directly ordering DOJ to address bump-stocks.  Am I accurate?
3290 2018-02-21 14:07:31 The loopholes are found by liberals bent on making more laws when making legislation. The bump stock legislation would have passed in a heartbeat if it stopped at banning bump stocks. They overstepped the bounds as always.
3291 2018-02-21 14:07:15 Bump stocks do not make a semi automatic weapon into a machine gun ! They do however make the easier to shoot at higher rates
3292 2018-02-21 14:07:01 It seems like the left is walking into a trap. @realDonaldTrump will come out in support of banning assault rifles/bump stocks, etc. while working aggressively behind the scenes to kill it - ala DACA.
3293 2018-02-21 14:06:54 Because they all thought you would lose and ignore it. They want you out of office because you are an outsider. By the way I hope you do not enact an executive order   based on emotion in regards to bump stocks.  Have a great day and stay strong.
3294 2018-02-21 14:06:47 Why is Trump Talking about guns, bump stocks etc.. NOW????
Where have you been?? You see votes getting away from you!!!
Talk Talk Talk as usual   Vote him out!
3295 2018-02-21 14:06:15 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks not the big issue.  We need to ban, confiscate and destroy all assault guns, period.  2nd amendment applies to musket loaders only
3296 2018-02-21 14:06:07 Well said one question, apart from convection hw much in practically the micro caps works (I mean out of 5 stocks how many will be successful )
3297 2018-02-21 14:06:03 $AMZN  how about ATH today !!  only $11 more, tiny % . I will hit $2K with patience as a LT investment !!  $QQQ $XRT #stocks #trade #investing
3298 2018-02-21 14:06:01 You know what? I’ll put my pride down, though I usually disagree with his general existence, thank you @realDonaldTrump for helping to ban devices such as bump stocks. I can respect that.
3299 2018-02-21 14:05:42 First, bump stocks, then anything you can attach a bump stock to. Slippery slope.
3300 2018-02-21 14:05:36 I agree with that. I don't think bump stocks should be legal. Automatic weapons waste bullets according to my brother in law who knows guns.
3301 2018-02-21 14:04:56 90% OF THE MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE ON BUMP STOCKS, ANYONE WHO WANTED ON GOT ONE
3302 2018-02-21 14:04:45 I'm willing to bet that someone had to explain to Trump that bump stocks wasn't some kind of wall st investment strategy.
3303 2018-02-21 14:04:43 @AmericaNewsroom : and how does banning bump stocks prevent a massacre such as The recent Parkland school shooing?
3304 2018-02-21 14:04:41 Democrats still won't get what they want, but these kids will get AGE HIGHER,BUMP STOCKS,no MACHINE GUNS. hate them anyway,only MILITARY need those! @SenFeinstein @NancyPelosi @nytimes @washingtonpost @maddow @DonLemon_CNN @AC360 also MENTAL HEALTH bill! 
3305 2018-02-21 14:04:37 Any support from Trump will be strictly along NRA lines. Bump stocks is an easy one.
3306 2018-02-21 14:04:35 Exactly, cryptos have more utility than actual equity stocks. And yes I am going hold until things become more stable but that won’t be years until the marketcap is in the trillions. Even if you don’t believe just buy a little and forget about it.
3307 2018-02-21 14:04:32 Banning bump stocks is a joke. There's only been just 1 mass shooting where they were used. Need to ban the weapons/guns that they are used on.
3308 2018-02-21 14:04:18 After the Vegas shooting there was no agreement to ban bump stocks.  Now they’re being put out as a conciliation because what the public really wants is to ban AR-15s.  Gun companies don’t want that.  $$$$$.
3309 2018-02-21 14:03:37 Know what'll make them feel safer? Bump stocks. 
Don't blame me, I'm just saying what people who aren't thinking are thinking.
3310 2018-02-21 14:03:28 Why is @MSNBC @SRuhle letting the #BumpStockHoax take over the narrative? This is about #BanAssaultWeapons. Were bump stocks used in Florida?
3311 2018-02-21 14:03:27 They were speaking just like this on CNN this am - bump stocks were only the beginning, it’s a long term project for them.
3312 2018-02-21 14:02:55 I don't know, but that's my new favourite hashtag
3313 2018-02-21 14:02:48 *2 mass shootings later*
“Bump stocks probably shouldn’t be a thing” - Our so so smart and gracious president of the United States
3314 2018-02-21 14:02:14 Banning semi-automatic weapons would be Brave. Taking on bump stocks gives GOP and Trump cover to do nothing more. Semi-automatic weapons are weapons of war, and have no place on American streets. You want to really be seem as brave, Mr President?  Reinstitute that ban.
3315 2018-02-21 14:01:50 banning bump stocks? So calculated. Why not AR15's? Because that would cause blowback from the NRA. Banning bumpstocks might fool people into thinking you're doing something.
3316 2018-02-21 14:01:50 Oh no! I had a lip wobble when he talked about you all in his speech. He'll be missed.
3317 2018-02-21 14:01:39 An AR -15  cannot be easily modified into fully automatic.  In order to do that you have to heavily modify the firing mechanism in the receiver.  
You might be thinking of bump stocks, an external add-on, which allow a higher rate of fire but do not modify the gun.
3318 2018-02-21 14:01:36 Agree! Just H being a dpoil sport and causing the stocks to tumble again
3319 2018-02-21 14:01:07 I need your stocks!

3321 2018-02-21 14:01:06 BofA on 4-week average trends: 

Hedge funds have been sellers of US stocks since late Jan.2018.

Institutional clients have been net sellers since early Feb 2016.

Private clients have been net buyers since
early Feb. 2018.
3322 2018-02-21 14:01:03 With how DACA went with him after he said he wanted to help them I don't see why anyone would take him seriously here. He'll propose a half-measure like bump stocks and try to extract something worse from Dems for it.
3323 2018-02-21 14:00:48 Bump stocks for that case, raise age limit for school shooting cases. Can you not sort this stuff out yourself or are you going to resist any common sense proposals?
3324 2018-02-21 14:00:39 An AR won't do shit to a rhino I was thinking more along the lines of deer or elk since it's the same caliber as hunting rifles commonly used for deer or elk an AR would also be a good choice for hunting because of hours light it is compared to guns with wooden stocks.
3325 2018-02-21 14:00:30 Bless him, it’s the end of an era. Where do we campaign to get him a peerage #Lordunclemeurig

3331 2018-02-21 13:59:49 If your response as a gun store upon hearing that Trump wants to ban bump stocks is to raise prices to cash out rather than to proactively refuse to sell them - Congratulations, you're a piece of shit war capitalist who has the blood of school children on your hands. #guncontrol
3332 2018-02-21 13:59:27 Thought for the moment... take your bump-stocks and your Assault rifles and shove them up your arses. Guns NOT mental illness/anger ABSOLUTELY ARE the problem. You have an Arsenal but can only use one at a time, so why so many? Crazy with knives=less damage than a-hole with gun.
3333 2018-02-21 13:59:23 Most PSU bank stocks also gained. SBI was up 1.28%,  Syndicate Bank 0.6%, Bank of Baroda 0.59%, Canara Bank 0.1%, Allahabad  Bank 0.97%, Dena Bank 2.96%, and PNB 0.47%. However,  Bank of India was down 0.35%, United Bank of India 2.08%, and Union Bank  of India 1.53%.
3334 2018-02-21 13:59:19 Only until he finds out that bump stocks are necessary for squirrel hunting. He still mistakenly believes everybody is talking about 'burp' stocks ...
3335 2018-02-21 13:59:09 First priority is Congress to roll back and legislate to repeal the #Obama no-decision that allowed bump-stocks to be sold. 

The bump-stock modification used in Las Vegas was allowed (despite objections) during the Obama admin. #Truth
3336 2018-02-21 13:59:06 Trump’s plans to turbocharge economy could slam stocks, Jack Ablin warns...
3337 2018-02-21 13:58:47 How are we going to prepare for the craziness that will ensue because of that tipping point? One concession (banning bump stocks) has already whipped the trump base into a frothy mess, and a video alleging that @davidhogg111 is a criss actor is trending second on youtube.
3338 2018-02-21 13:58:35 Yes.  But in this case there is no obvious inconsistency between the LFS stocks figures (sharp slowing of rate of increase) and the IPS flows figures (sharp fall in net inflows).
3339 2018-02-21 13:58:34 Talking to Mum about which stocks to invest in 
3340 2018-02-21 13:58:22 No to guns on campus except for security. Business' don't need extra permission to protect themselves. Self-defense already applies. I worry they'll shoot someone for stealing a candy bar. Yes on prohibiting bump stocks.
3341 2018-02-21 13:57:56 Hi, we don’t have to use all salt stocks in one season as all Dorset’s material is covered. It can be carried over to the next winter.
3342 2018-02-21 13:57:24 I agree Mr. President, you have my full support but I don’t agree with the ban on bump stocks!! #MAGA #2ndAmendment
3343 2018-02-21 13:57:20 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks does nothing to prevent the #FloridaShooting. Grow a pair and suggest a ban on semi automatic weapons. No reason for them in our society. #GunControlNow
3344 2018-02-21 13:57:15 @realDonaldTrump RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS and PROVE you have no financial ties to Russia

Bump Stocks are not enough, Semi assault riffles need to be banned- follow Reagans lead on this.
3345 2018-02-21 13:57:14 You're confusing stocks with flows Rob.  Both the headline LFS numbers, the IPS,  and NiNos all consistent with falling net EU migration, for work and otherwise.
3346 2018-02-21 13:57:12 Our problem isn’t bump stocks. Our problem is kids buying rifles. Raise the age requirement, make the background check more extensive, make magazine sizes smaller, DO SOMETHING other than banning a bump stock that is just a piece of plastic that goes on the gun.
3347 2018-02-21 13:57:10 The issue is not guns falling into the hands of kids.  Or mental illness.  Or bump stocks.  The issue is guns.  We are the only society that has allowed such a plague to be unleashed against us...and the problem won't go until we dramatically, not slightly, reduce their numbers.
3348 2018-02-21 13:57:01 That goes without saying. My parents already have a house but I bet they'd love a nice vacation house. Then I'd build my dream house, get a car, invest in business and stocks, and then do a LOT of shopping.
3349 2018-02-21 13:56:58 IT stocks gained on recent weakness in rupee against the dollar and as  Nasscom reportedly issued a cautiously optimistic outlook for the Indian  IT sector.
3350 2018-02-21 13:56:55 I read that Trump is planning on banning bump stocks but my tired brain read it as "banning bobby socks" and I was very distressed
3351 2018-02-21 13:56:52 Bump stocks are a novelty that wears down your non full auto capable barrel unless it’s upgraded to a heavier one. I was going to order one just because the left didn’t want me to have one but I wouldn’t use it but a couple of times for grins so in the long run it wasn’t worth it
3352 2018-02-21 13:56:50 Those are the headline estimates of long-term international immigration flows based on the International Passenger Survey. @ONS has repeatedly warned against using stocks data to measure flows. They also say they don't think the IPS based estimates are wrong.
3353 2018-02-21 13:56:40 Liberals be like “Gun control now!” 

Trump says “okay ban Bump stocks and let’s raise the age to buy AR-15s. 

Liberals “OMFG NRA terrorist”
3354 2018-02-21 13:56:29 No point for bump stocks. Plus it can’t stop further bans of weapons. In my opinion.
3355 2018-02-21 13:56:23 Then let Congress pass a law banning bump stocks.

Stop making excuses for governing by regulation.
3356 2018-02-21 13:56:22 We can't let this go. Trump is trying to make #GunReformNow go away by giving us this empty gesture of finally doing something about bump stocks. It's too little too late. It's not enough. We need #GunReformNow. We need to have assault weapons banned an nothing less.
3357 2018-02-21 13:56:22 The work done by the Advisory Councils shows that for most stocks the #LandingObligation is achievable, says @ikingmaNL. But winter is coming - 2019 is around the corner and we must now find ingenious solutions for the remaining residual chokes. #CFP2020
3358 2018-02-21 13:56:05 Its only zero in February & March but the annual tonnage of bass allowed still exceeds scientific advice for yet another year. In what circumstances are is the scientific advice likely to be followed, when bass stocks collapse perhaps?
3359 2018-02-21 13:55:57 IT stocks gained after Nasscom reportedly issued a cautiously optimistic outlook for the Indian IT sector.
3360 2018-02-21 13:55:51 I think it’s cuz bump stocks are low demand,  aftermarket kit-built products, hence negligible risk to PAC $$$ from NRA and manufacturers
3361 2018-02-21 13:55:48 The "bump stock" ban is ignorant twaddle. Its definition of bump stock is incoherent. Bump stocks are gimmicks that do nothing people can't do without them. Typical meaningless gun control legislation.
3362 2018-02-21 13:55:43 The landing obligation of fish stocks is a solvable problem - good will and ingenuity is needed #CFP2020 #CFPreality
3363 2018-02-21 13:55:38 la seule méthode pour limiter le changement climatique serait de laisser une partie des stocks de fossiles en sous sol, cad ne pas tout exploiter jusquà l'os pétrole/charbon et gaz. Aucune chance dans un monde dirigé par le capitalisme...
3364 2018-02-21 13:55:29 I agree, bump stocks are NOT needed. And I am a 2nd Amendment 100% believer. Even have an AR15 and several other weapons.
3365 2018-02-21 13:55:28 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I am a teacher from Stoneman Douglas High School. No bump stocks were used here but they should be banned. The AR 15 was used and should be banned. It was 1994 to 2004. 2nd Amendment guarantees right to bear arms (I own a pistol & rifle) not AR15s
3366 2018-02-21 13:55:25 What part of "shall not be infringed" includes banning bump stocks and background checks?
3367 2018-02-21 13:55:08 Markets largely embrace the budget: rand, local bonds and share market, though limited to certain stocks.
3368 2018-02-21 13:54:31 Hey @realDonaldTrump!! Instead of banning bump stocks, why don’t you ban the weapons that are converted to automatic fire through the use of bump stocks?? #SensibleGunControl #NoNRAMoney
3369 2018-02-21 13:54:19 So funny that porn is bad, but all these assault rifles, bump stocks, etc are extensions of, or rather symptoms of, small penis syndrome.
3370 2018-02-21 13:54:06 @TheDaleJackson  Will Clete give Pres Trump credit on banning bump stocks?
3371 2018-02-21 13:53:21 Didn't the Obama administration approve bump stocks?  Just saying.
3372 2018-02-21 13:53:18 @permabear_uk $QCOM is such a badly run company, consistently misses earnings/revenues, always fighting with their customers. Much better #semiconductors stocks to own such as $NVDA $MU $INTC etc #investing #trading #TomsTruths

3374 2018-02-21 13:52:41 Well, at least you're not alone.  I usually go by the 30/30/40 rule on these types of stocks, and would have taken my first couple sets of profits on this one when it jumped up a while back, but nope, didn't put in my sell orders and completely missed.
3375 2018-02-21 13:52:17 Oooo, stop bump stocks.  But allow mentally ill to buy guns.  And the NRA wants to arm teachers.  Say, when did you guys get your guns back after Obama took them all?  #NRABloodMoney
3376 2018-02-21 13:52:03 More thorough mental-health screening & banning bump stocks won't stop the killings. That's trump throwing us tiny bones so we'll believe he cares. He doesn't. Nothing less than a total ban on all assault weapons is the only valid first step. #NoCompromise

3385 2018-02-21 13:51:04 @POTUS Respectfully Mr. President concerning the ban on bump stocks, there are videos showing how to use a belt loop on ones pants as a bump stock, I guess  banning bump stocks will be a good gesture though
3386 2018-02-21 13:50:58 So in other words - Obama accomplished nothing and so far Trump has accomplished nothing (we don't know about the ban on the bump stocks yet).  It's a great big tie of nothingness.  Yeah America!

3400 2018-02-21 13:48:30 Yes but Joe, it's HIS fault because he took a couple steps backwards by taking the mental health/felons right to own guns. Now besides the bump stocks you STILL have to put that back in place plus an age limits on ability of buying guns. Parents can still get the kids guns
3401 2018-02-21 13:48:29 Trump has said he wants bump stocks to be made illegal in this country and I think it’s about time. As pro-gun as I am, there is no need for a bump stock and I’m excited to see the government making a move to better protect us

3414 2018-02-21 13:45:57 After Las Vegas, Maryland Democrats started moving legislation to ban bump stocks.

Even Trump is now moving to ban them.

3416 2018-02-21 13:45:37 I am not for taking any right away but banning bump stocks and requiring background checks on private sales would be something we all could agree on. I still drive around with a rifle between the seat and the console when I go to feed cattle.

3479 2018-02-21 13:33:34 Piers, how many mass murders have used bump stocks? This “big” move by the President would have stopped one attack? You do know that there is a shooting technique that mimics bump stock action without the need for a bump stock, right? Most of us gun owners don’t need them.
3480 2018-02-21 13:33:31 Delay tactic. Congress can act on its own. Referring bump stocks to federal agency is being done to slow the process down.  Congress should act now. Feinstein et al have bill.

3496 2018-02-21 13:30:04 @Morning_Joe trump is “talking” about bump stocks and AR’s.  Why can’t he revoke the EO he signed giving mentally ill access to guns.  That would be an immediate “action” to show good intent. Actions speak louder than words.

3501 2018-02-21 13:29:08 Just like with bump stocks, this is the equivalent of banning headlights from cars in the hopes that it would prevent drunk driving.

3506 2018-02-21 13:28:19 I think it’s great to see @POTUS acting. Bump stocks, talking about background checks. 
Hopefully, we’ll finally get some changes. 
Supreme Court will reign in the limits appropriately. Let the people push things as far as they can to start making change.

Because Trump is lying

3525 2018-02-21 13:24:04 R's, D's, and the NRA all agree that bump-stocks need much tighter regulation, and our elected officials couldn't or wouldn't take any action. They must be replaced with thinking, acting, adults who don't vaciliate,  but do something!

•Buybacks

•Redflag hotline
•Graduated licencing
•Extended waiting period

No excuses, America.

#WeCallBS #NeverAgain
3535 2018-02-21 13:21:38 They are a waste of money and just waste ammo but that's beside the point. They do not make a semi-auto into an full auto. Bump stocks are 1 pull of the trigger 1 round expended, that's text book semi-auto.
3536 2018-02-21 13:21:21 Buffett wrote the best piece about stocks and inflation in Fortune many years ago
3537 2018-02-21 13:20:49 The fact is the bump stocks made him less accurate and he probably killed less people because of them. I'm not even sure he used bump stocks I think they're lying to us. I honestly don't give a rat's ass about bump stocks. You are insane
3538 2018-02-21 13:20:36 Yesterday I even thought “I bet bump stocks are flying off the shelves”
3539 2018-02-21 13:20:18 But don't you think something needs to be done? NO ONE NEEDS BUMP STOCKS,  NO  ONE,  NO B NEED FOR ANY AUTO FINE!
3540 2018-02-21 13:20:13 Again, it made his weapon more efficient to kill innocent people. Both the gun and the bumb stocks need to be made illegal for civilian purchase.
3541 2018-02-21 13:20:04 Credit where it's due, Trump moving on gun control is something unexpected, and good.  I hope this isn't a trick, distraction, or whatever. 

It doesn't go far enough, but it's a start.  The fight has to continue past bump stocks.
3542 2018-02-21 13:19:55 It starts with bump stocks and other modifications. Then it will just trickle down.
3543 2018-02-21 13:19:36 Not a great defense.   A more important point is that Obama probably had no idea what bump stocks were- like most everyone else- because they hadn't been used in a high profile mass murder.

 Had this happened under his watch he would have done everything he could to fix it.
3544 2018-02-21 13:19:09 Ok, great, ban bump stocks, but one was not used in #FloridaSchoolShooting . Why are we rearranging around the edge of the real issue? #NoMoreBullshit #BanAssaultWeapons
3545 2018-02-21 13:19:04 Trump saying he will ban bump stocks (which he is only doing because the NRA gave him permission) is not even closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, it is nudging the door so it is fractionally less open! #guncontrol #bumpstocks
3546 2018-02-21 13:18:54 Would’ve been better giving my hard-earned to my border collie to pick stocks. Woof woof 
3547 2018-02-21 13:18:51 The NRA offered to give up bumper stocks after Vegas but the out rage died down before they actually had to. So they are going back to something the NRA has ALLOWED them to sacrifice. It is a Band-Aid. A meaningless gesture. The Stoneman shhoter didn't use one. Just an AR.
3548 2018-02-21 13:18:50 Bump stocks just might be the bone the NRA throws us just to distract the AR-15 debate. Even most of the staunchest 2nd amendment protectors could get behind that.
3549 2018-02-21 13:18:43 @Pornhub and #kleenex stocks are plummeting as we speak... #Floridiots
3550 2018-02-21 13:18:41 Cool. You’re anti-AR-15s and bump stocks, which is basically as pro-gun control as I am. We don’t need guns like that, but I’m all good with more reasonable guns. And obviously “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” but they kill the most people the easiest with a gun
3551 2018-02-21 13:18:31 I'm not attacking. I'm stating facts. Bumb stocks were used in that shooting. Yes? And they were used so he could make his weapon more efficient for killing innocent people. That's a problem that needs to be addressed.
3552 2018-02-21 13:18:24 Again, bump stocks are effective enough to cause death and mayhem. Didn’t Paddock fire 1,100 rounds in 10 minutes? Bump stocked semi-auto or full-auto is a distinction without a practical difference.
3553 2018-02-21 13:18:12 Doesn't matter all i need is a rubber band. But bump stocks are pointless.

3555 2018-02-21 13:18:06 Drumpf is president now, albeit illegitimatly. Then he shouldn't have a problem banning bump stocks. Since he has a sick, jealous, unhealthy obsession w/Obama and repeals all the good he did.
3556 2018-02-21 13:18:01 Very little of me is laughing in all this..
 But part of me can't stop laughing that after Obama tried to move mountains on gun control and Republicans wouldn't give a single vote, a republican president wants to ban bump stocks and is talking background checks!
3557 2018-02-21 13:17:27 @StansburyShow @Fantone people who have no idea what they're talking about push to ban "Tacticool" weapons because they look scary. Guns are guns period and can kill just as many people regardless given the training. Blaming bump stocks is just another short term scapegoat
3558 2018-02-21 13:17:03 @michaelcburgess I urge you to support any piece of gun legislation that supports tighter background checks, eliminating bump stocks & assault weapons. Be the change. #NeverAgain
3559 2018-02-21 13:17:00 No one used bump stocks until Las Vegas but due to the media hysteria w/flaming red arrows pointing to them as a good way to increase trigger pulls (but not accuracy if there are specific targets) then it's likely that will have the same results media attention did for AR-15s
3560 2018-02-21 13:16:51 this is something I never thought I would read about trump... "Trump says he's signed a memo directing the Justice Department to propose regulations to 'ban all devices' like bump stocks used in 2017's Las Vegas massacre." I think its the first thing he wants that I support!
3561 2018-02-21 13:16:20 U.S. government sends ICE agents out to arrest & deport people on old, sketchy traffic violations.

3562 2018-02-21 13:15:59 Ban bump stocks, strong background checks, 21 to buy a gun. I am ok with all that. Bundle this with immigration issues. #DACA, Fully fund wall, end chain migration and visa lottery. Make Dems vote no to all that.
3563 2018-02-21 13:15:58 Banning bump stocks ain’t going to work, the yanks need to ban assault rifles. Why do you need an AR-15 to hunt deer, I don’t my .308 works very well thank you!!
3564 2018-02-21 13:15:51 The team has some considerable names who have already proven themselves successful. Sometimes risks pay off. Since we’re all here talking about penny stocks, isn’t the riskiness already implied?
3565 2018-02-21 13:15:50 Small actions from a small president.  @realDonaldTrump is just doing the bidding of the @nra who told him they were willing to sacrifice bump stocks to show that he is "doing something" when in fact he is doing very very very little.
3566 2018-02-21 13:15:37 Does asking to ban bump stocks make any difference? Isn’t it too little too late?
3567 2018-02-21 13:15:24 It is the right policy with a caveat. If he passes something on bump stocks but ignores the rest of the problem, it does nothing to make us safer and lets the GOP argue that that is all that is needed. Then, when it doesn't decrease shootings, they say gun control doesn't work.
3568 2018-02-21 13:15:16 Now you're ready to reconsider bump stocks? Now you're ready to demand background checks? See kids? You can make a difference. It only took another 17 of you being killed. Smh

3580 2018-02-21 13:13:21 The issue isn't about the right to own guns. It's about the right to SELL arms. Gun stocks go up after massacres gunmakers r making millions
3581 2018-02-21 13:13:19 @realDonaldTrump  Good start to "ban all devices" like the rapid fire bump stocks, but I pray that this is extended to the multiple shot magazines. I know little about guns but you know what I am requesting as a fellow republican.
3582 2018-02-21 13:12:55 For example let’s take $AAPL. I purchased it at $97 per share several years ago. Morningstar says to consider purchasing it at $102. I’m owning a 5 star stock now based upon this.  It’s true for all my stocks I have purchased in years past.
3583 2018-02-21 13:12:45 I already check with them. And as per policy there are many good stocks in your restricted script so it's difficult to achieve full capabilities of demat account. I am just thinking for other options.
3584 2018-02-21 13:12:44 I agree that AR-15’s should be taken away. Trump made a big move by proposing to get rid of bump stocks and other gun mods. The reason I’m comparing them to guns is they have all been used for murder. We can’t say that people with guns kill more people so others don’t matter

3590 2018-02-21 13:11:42 La cosa triste, e l'avete mostrata voi del @ilpost dopo la strage di Las Vegas, è quel video dove un tizio molto serio spiega che senza "bump stocks" lo sparatore avrebbe potuto uccidere con più efficacia.
3591 2018-02-21 13:11:42 The Obama ATF ruled that hey had no jurisdiction over bump stocks as they were not guns.  The NRA supported legislation banning bump stocks which Congress failed to enact.
3592 2018-02-21 13:11:36 Also this doesn’t seem to affect the stock at all. When I was looking to buy tech stocks Twitter was $14 a share. Now it’s sitting above $30! Despite real user growth being nonexistent.

3597 2018-02-21 13:10:11 @realDonaldTrump raising the age to buy a gun or banning bump-stocks will do nothing. If you want to stop this madness, get God back into the schools and homes. We spent 50 years kicking God out of the public places and we wonder why people have no value for life.

3600 2018-02-21 13:09:37 Banning Bump stocks is only going to make all want to buy assault weapons. Please ban all Assault weapons first, then ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase "All" weapons
3601 2018-02-21 13:09:10 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks were not involved in Florida. You are on a slippery slope starting this process. Deal with the mental illness issue and forget about the 2nd amendment attack. DACA people back to their own country and follow the law.
3602 2018-02-21 13:09:10 @realDonaldTrump good job trying to get better background checks and getting rid of bump stocks!
3603 2018-02-21 13:09:06 Yes I watch the news too Brian.  The ban addresses bump stocks, not machine guns, Tommy guns or fully automatic weapons all of which are already banned under fed law.
3604 2018-02-21 13:08:45 Plus it would just be nibbling around the edges to try to keep Repubs in office. Anything less than expanded background checks, bump stocks and banning assault weapons and they're just playing games.

3607 2018-02-21 13:08:20 Banning bump stocks and not assault weapons is pathetic. Presidential yet? You need to read Tom Friedman's article, Joe, for a reality check.
3608 2018-02-21 13:08:15 That argument doesn't seem balanced with the Quinnipiac numbers.

3616 2018-02-21 13:07:41 Why don’t you acknowledge what @POTUS is doing and has proposed regarding outlawing bump stocks?? 

What are your suggestions on how to keep our students safe, SPECIFICALLY?? Not what you think is wrong currently but what you actually PLAN TO DO ABOUT IT?? #MarchForOurLives
3617 2018-02-21 13:07:41 “Larger society” agrees that no one needs an assault rifle or bump stocks and wants strict background checks.
3618 2018-02-21 13:07:39 Oh, by the way, if passed, only bad guys will have bump stocks.  Only good guys who follow law won't.

3623 2018-02-21 13:06:45 Ban bump stocks? First, it was the firearms, now it’s the bump stocks...not the person firing the weapon?
3624 2018-02-21 13:06:20 Here is an exercise for you. Take the stocks in your portfolio, & tabulate the price you paid when you purchased. Then go to Morningstar and look up the 5 star price. Have you held your value stocks long enough to have purchased 5 stars? ...

3628 2018-02-21 13:05:37 Bannng bump stocks is a drop in the bucket..Reality check
3629 2018-02-21 13:04:42 If Trump thinks we will drop #gunreformnow because all of a sudden he's willing to do something about bump stocks, he's sadly mistaken. We will not rest until all assault rifles are banned. It's too little too late!
3630 2018-02-21 13:04:20 @netnethunter what’s the cut off for debt for the different buckets of stocks?

3632 2018-02-21 13:04:07 Background checks? After nullifying restrictions for gun sales to mentally ill?
What a guy.

But (just) now offering a ban on bump-stocks?

3636 2018-02-21 13:03:36 WHY? Do you have any idea what an AR15 really is, or are you just following the #liberal line?
An AR15 is no more dangerous than any other small caliber hunting rifle. As a matter of fact, the only difference between the two are the stocks, aesthetics.
3637 2018-02-21 13:03:28 What about the bump stocks you can print at home on a 3d printer. Are you going to ban 3d printers too

3646 2018-02-21 13:01:00 #BumpStockBan #3dBumpStock
Banning bump stocks. Ridiculous lip service to the NRA. You can print these on a 3d printer at home. You can also make a robotic device that will do the same thing. What next, ban 3d printers. I call bs.
3647 2018-02-21 13:00:57 Feeling a bit emotional at Uncle Meurig's farewell speech. What a dude. #NFU18
3648 2018-02-21 13:00:54 An important point: the gun makers don't manufacture bump stocks so they won't care if bump stocks are banned.  
Banning is the right thing to do but it is not enough and is meant to appease and distract.
3649 2018-02-21 13:00:54 Fuck all my bots went down with the stocks #TwitterLockOut
3650 2018-02-21 13:00:50 @RepNewhouse , @PattyMurray , @SenatorCantwell. For gun control, don't go for the bump stocks.  It is the magazines/clips that carry 10 to 40 rounds that are the real problem.  Limit the size of the clips to 4 rounds, all you need for hunting.  Shotguns can only have 3 to 5 shots
3651 2018-02-21 13:00:12 Bush didn’t push tie regulate bump stocks.  Trump is.  Obama didn’t either btw

3654 2018-02-21 12:59:51 What gets me is we aren't (I'm not) trying to take away guns, just bump stocks and semi/auto assault riffles. That's what I don't understand them defending.
3655 2018-02-21 12:59:35 Bump stocks are the spinner hubcaps of the firearms world.

3658 2018-02-21 12:59:14 Only thing here correct is regarding bump stocks. Like they said, their manufacturers don’t make bump stocks so they don’t really care if they are made illegal. That’s Wayne’s own words. Post link to their support of background checks.

3660 2018-02-21 12:58:40 We can't settle for banning bump stocks..that is a weak response to the REAL ISSUE! The only reason that was proffered because it would have the least impact on nra.its like taking a manslaughter plea vs 1st degree murder.ban ar 15
3661 2018-02-21 12:58:34 As President Trump called for the justice department to put a ban on bump stocks, our local lawmakers voted a similar bill out. How it’s pushing students to take action - NEXT on #abc15

3666 2018-02-21 12:57:39 "Donald Trump Signs Memorandum Directing AG Jeff Sessions To “Propose Regulations” Banning Bump Stocks"
Key word here is 'Propose'
"put forward (an idea or plan) for consideration or discussion by others."
He's not telling him to do it but to 'talk about it'
Which means - NO!
3667 2018-02-21 12:56:44 Dear #Gunsense Supporters,

You want a ban on bump stocks? Fine, we get National CCW reciprocity. It's a compromise that you get what you want and we get what we want.  If not, then no deal!

3668 2018-02-21 12:56:10 @cspanwj I love my bump stocks... fondle the foreign ones?
3669 2018-02-21 12:56:10 The danger with the bump stock regs @realDonaldTrump is pushing is not the stocks themselves. It’s what it leads to. The libs’ goal is to classify all semi-autos as machine guns. Wake up people!
3670 2018-02-21 12:55:53 Trump has agreed to ban bump stocks, but that won't be good enough for the left because it is not 100 percent their way and even if it was, the left would still complain
3671 2018-02-21 12:55:51 An aquisition for stock $WAAS has been executed #pennyStocks #stocks #MergerAgreement #Trade #StockTrading
3672 2018-02-21 12:55:43 Approving the bump stocks is actually a good thing. The more people who believe the hollywood myth that spraying a room with full auto is the best way to kill lots of people, the better.
3673 2018-02-21 12:55:40 Thoughts on Trump banning bump stocks?
3674 2018-02-21 12:55:20 Which is my point. Anything to distract from Parkland is the game they are playing. Get rid of bump stocks? Good! But AR-15 style rifles are the real issue. No obfuscation!
3675 2018-02-21 12:55:04 Please explain how banning bump stocks will do anything to stop a mass shooting tomorrow, next week, next month, next year? #HardenSoftTargets #HardenSoftTargets #HardenSoftTargets #HardenSoftTargets #HardenSoftTargets
3676 2018-02-21 12:54:45 I thought, he said they'll look into banning bump stocks.  Isn't that code of politicians to say:"Give us time to find research and studies that will say, that bump stocks are lifesavers."?
That is how our german politician operate about Dieselcars.
3677 2018-02-21 12:54:38 You can get banned from the_donald for posting things Trump and the Whitehouse actually said. I was banned for posting about how Trump wants to hike aid to Israel as well as ban bump stocks

3679 2018-02-21 12:54:01 Trump backs ban on 'bump stocks' on semi-automatic weapons: Trump will do a 'throw the dog a bone" act to appear to be doing something about gun control- be wise to his con tactics. People of the US- stand up now and demand radical gun control laws that really make a difference!!

3681 2018-02-21 12:53:19 In the FWIW category, the NDR Trading Sentiment Composite has risen out of the excessive pessimism zone and is now neutral. Near-term tailwind for stocks has dissipated.
3682 2018-02-21 12:53:10 telling DOJ to ban bump stocks will do NOTHING. ATF says accessories to guns aren't under their dept. It would take legislation to ban them. Dems put forth such a bill after Vegas & Reps leaders wouldn't even bring it to a vote on the floor. The NRA & Reps have blood on their
3683 2018-02-21 12:52:58 See this? This is why I am glad to see Whole Foods taking it on the chin.  No store that only stocks fake medicine deserves to stay in business.

I'm serious, their entire pharmacy section is herbal and homeopathic garbage.
3684 2018-02-21 12:52:57 The president is now looking into banning "bump stocks", which is a response I guess to the Las Vegas massacre, placing him only a little behind the curve--the Parkland killer evidently did not use that device.
3685 2018-02-21 12:52:48 sir stocks which are not in FnO  they also fall  so stop trading that is right solution
3686 2018-02-21 12:52:37 Trump outlaws bump stocks
3687 2018-02-21 12:52:35 So we're missing the medication conversation and going straight back to talking about  bump stocks...
3688 2018-02-21 12:52:05 @KMOV Bump stocks do not convert a semi suitor into a "fully automatic" firearm. The trigger is still pulled once-per-bullet fired.

*Trump moves to ban bump stocks after Florida*

Trumpers: lol who cares
3692 2018-02-21 12:51:47 Get real, bump stocks yes but assault weapons must go
3693 2018-02-21 12:51:10 Love  the guy, but bump stocks were legalized under th Obama administration. And Trump, guy that everyone, including myself, loves to hate is moving towards a ban on them. But y’all still gonna find something to complain about.
3694 2018-02-21 12:50:59 You stupid Fudds better wake up. When the libs realize you can bump fire your “sporting” rifles without a damn bump stock, your “sporting rifles” will be classified as “machine guns.” They’re chomping at the bit for an AWB. @realDonaldTrump already betrayed us on bump stocks...
3695 2018-02-21 12:50:48 But out of those true automatic weapons that are used in these deaths, how many of those weapons were actually legal and registered? Bump-stocks are already illegal.
3696 2018-02-21 12:50:43 0bama wanted bump stocks for the rifles he gave to the Mexican drug cartels.
3697 2018-02-21 12:50:26 Trump ordered Feds to try to ban gun “bump stocks” in wake of Parkland shooting even though the device was not used at the high school.
3698 2018-02-21 12:50:26 There are already questions about the legality of Trump's order; that's the reason why ATF refused to implement policy and regs. As much as I want bump stocks banned, we can't do it by any means; people and orgs besides the NRA would object and I'm pretty sure they'd be right.
3699 2018-02-21 12:50:17 Dear MSM, stop reporting @realDonaldTrump blocked bump  stocks. He didn't. He passed the buck to Kebler Elf, @jeffsessions, to look into banning them. This is a far cry from doing it. It was a PR stunt ahead of today's meeting with victims of gun violence, & you fell for it.
3700 2018-02-21 12:50:09 Don't go gettin' all excited about #Trump banning bump stocks.

Here's why:

- Sessions will drag his feet
- I don't believe it can be done be Executive Order.
- If legislation is required, it will never was Republican House.
- Lastly, the NRA

Therefore, #VoteThemOut2018
3701 2018-02-21 12:50:00 hi jay, can they let some other stocks run instead always nflx? just like 10 stocks and multitudes are suffering and if theyre ' up' they move up meagerly..jd should RUN like netflix
3702 2018-02-21 12:50:00 Bump stocks are already banned.  (How'd that work in Las Vegas?)
3703 2018-02-21 12:49:58 Trump speaks of banning bump stocks. Torn between thinking he may actually being doing something for the better or, thinking he’s taking the bare minimum stance on a device used multiple shootings ago allegedly developed for handicapped shooters.
3704 2018-02-21 12:49:40 With this and the outlawing of bump stocks, looks like Trump is signalling the beginning of much tighter restrictions around guns. Good.
3705 2018-02-21 12:49:17 @Para_Tweet daytraders paradise this end of market.these stocks in a world of there own.NCR bottom fishing could have made a 1/2 years wage on it if we only knew.

3707 2018-02-21 12:48:53 Outlawing bump stocks, working in why the FBI failed in it's duties, researching more about the Parkland shooting.
You know, stuff Obama would've been praised for.
3708 2018-02-21 12:48:49 I saw posts there complaining the NRA was too lax for opposing Bump Stocks 
3709 2018-02-21 12:48:10 REALLY?? And we really believe that ALL existing stocks of live, native smallpox - including the several tonnes rumoured to have been produced in the old Soviet Union - have all been accounted for? I'm a lot more scared of those being dug out!
3710 2018-02-21 12:48:00 By the way, you totally got clowned. Trump ordered Sessions to ban bump stocks yesterday.
3711 2018-02-21 12:47:01 Eliminating bump stocks don't violate the 2nd Amendment. Even the NRA is for this.
3712 2018-02-21 12:46:57 I don’t see how banning bump stocks could change things problem is morals  these shooters lack them some how we need to instill morals & teach what eternity is like if you kill. Lake of Fire will be torture.
3713 2018-02-21 12:46:55 What do bump stocks do?? When I tell you, I know nothing about guns. I think they are so destructive & do not belong in the hands of humans
3714 2018-02-21 12:46:27 Any rifle that can accept a 30+ round magazine is the problem. Bump stocks just escalate the problem.
3715 2018-02-21 12:46:06 Why can't we have FULLY automatic!?. And we should be able to keep bump stocks.
3716 2018-02-21 12:46:02 Do not let Barbera Boxer and the Dems. Be a part of crafting any gun bill. The trick will be on us if they do! Get rid of bump stocks Raise the gun age to 21 across the board one item per bill. No hidden agenda!!

3718 2018-02-21 12:44:54 What law would of stopped this tragedy from happening? What laws now on the books did not stop this from happening? Bump stocks should be banned but evil will do evil not matter what law is passed. To push a leftist "disarm us all agenda" is insincere to the victims and families
3719 2018-02-21 12:44:49 We have battery backup, we can't buy replacement batteries in Taree as no-one stocks them. It was the actual phone line, try to use the phone, even as a pager, and it says 'check tel line'.
So phone line is down. We may need to look at a different phone or a whistle.
3720 2018-02-21 12:44:33 I Dems prepared an open plan to ban bump stocks and anything else they see fit. If it were just bumpstocks most people would be ok with it. But the Dems wording leave it open to anything they want to ban. Not a good bill. That how you Dems work.
3721 2018-02-21 12:44:30 I Sure as Hell Would SUPPORT Your Proposition To BAN Bump Stocks ......  ASSault Weapons .... NO GUNS for those Under 21!  You Talk Big but NOW....FOLLOW THRU for Our Kids and Grandkids!  And For YOURS!
3722 2018-02-21 12:44:25 Never mind #kfc chicken I’m worried about #cadbury cream egg stocks.
3723 2018-02-21 12:44:09 In the interest of national security, students should demand an Executive Order prohibiting sales of ARs & Bump Stocks since every hour of the day more are produced & sold to public. Americans with these weapons are bigger threat to US citizena than foreign terrorists. #Parkland
3724 2018-02-21 12:43:42 Listening to NPR. Prez wants to ban bump stocks. Seems like misdirection considering that was a key issue in the LV shooting. Not being able to get a bump stock would not have stopped the shooter this time from killing those teachers and students. #banassaultweapons
3725 2018-02-21 12:43:26 No, we really dont. Stop listening to these idiots who dont know what theyre talking about. Those stocks were used in ONE violent crime. What you should do, is get rid of gun free zones, take some of the school funding and put it towards private security, or get cops to guard it
3726 2018-02-21 12:43:21 Trump’s statement on bump stocks was a test ballooon, nothing more.
3727 2018-02-21 12:43:00 Signing a memo to instruct the USAG to “propose” a ban on bump stocks.....cause that will change things. #geethanks #notreallyguncontrol
3728 2018-02-21 12:42:58 @LauraMonteverdi @AmandaJaegerTV a ban on bump stocks won’t keep someone from killing large numbers of people. I have 5 automatic rifles and with practice you can fire them just as fast #AR15 #gunsense
3729 2018-02-21 12:42:32 Really your the one who approved BUMP STOCKS
3730 2018-02-21 12:42:30 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well
3731 2018-02-21 12:42:11 After las vegas bump stocks is all we heard about, now its a joke? 
I like your point though.
3732 2018-02-21 12:42:03 I'm so for it but in the end it will be a bunch of people burning calories and nothing changing in Trump's DC from it. I hope I'm wrong but we need a ban on assault weapons not bump stocks.
3733 2018-02-21 12:42:00 By the stocks price action last two days.
3734 2018-02-21 12:42:00 @DrewSteeleRadio long before bump stocks and AR 15 we had rubber bands!  Problem is non military rifles the barrel will heat and bend, not good.  That's why Vegas Shooter had so many guns.  You don't need them to hunt, but the 2nd Amendment wasn't in case the deer turn against us
3735 2018-02-21 12:41:56 @realDonaldTrump is thinking about banning bump stocks, used in the Las Vegas massacre last October. So given his pace, he’ll consider saving students’ lives sometime around May. So much for his inauguration claim that American carnage ends now.
3736 2018-02-21 12:41:49 Don’t we need bump stocks and assault rifles for our well regulated militia?
3737 2018-02-21 12:41:46 With the amount of bearish sentiment around the US Stock Market, I believe many people are going to be caught off guard when we break to new highs. #StockMarket #stocks #NASDAQ #DowJones #SP500
3738 2018-02-21 12:41:35 @netnethunter, currently, how many stocks do you have in the inner circle portafolio?
3739 2018-02-21 12:41:15 Meanwhile, the pressure grows in Washington to do something on guns. Trump indicated he's open to strengthening background checks and directed theAG to look into banning bump stocks.BUT, The NRA agrees with him, so that equals “no progress”.
3740 2018-02-21 12:41:14 Nice rhyme. @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know what to do. Ban bump stocks, increase background checks, ban semi automatics? Ooh, it’s so confusing—which will improve the bottom line? Which will prevent bankruptcy?
3741 2018-02-21 12:41:11 Bull traders stop trading stocks in a down trend
3742 2018-02-21 12:40:51 If the GOP Congress passes, and Trump signs expanded background checks and restrictions on bump stocks, it's important to acknowledge it as progress. 

There's nearly a zero percent chance of that happening though.
3743 2018-02-21 12:40:28 Get your bump stocks while you can.
3744 2018-02-21 12:40:11 I bought 6 items from BTS 4th Muster from ktown4u. i hope ktown4u manage to secure the stocks >.<
3745 2018-02-21 12:39:55 I hope another platform other than Gab not really user friendly, and twitter stocks tank!!
3746 2018-02-21 12:39:38 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
3747 2018-02-21 12:39:38 I'm fully invested in high quality international net nets. Inner Circle Portfolio was up 66% last year. Still good net net stocks to buy in 2018.
3748 2018-02-21 12:39:23 Comnpanies manufacturing bump stocks don't have a legal budget to litigate. I doubt the NRA will oppose @realDonaldTrump .
3749 2018-02-21 12:39:20 Your falling for the BIG CON, the NRA was quiet for the past week while Trump and NRA had a meeting. The meeting was to figure out what to do about all the heat with the latest massacre. Let’s throw the fools a bone we’ll support a ban on bump stocks. More $$$ in AR16s
3750 2018-02-21 12:39:09 A GOOD MOVE? President Trump has ordered the Attorney General to work on developing rules to ban the sale of "Bump Stocks", devices which make semi-automatic guns more like automatic weapons. The stocks have been used in several mass shootings - including the one in Las Vegas. …
3751 2018-02-21 12:39:07 Banning bump stocks is the lowest hanging fruit there is. Especially after Las Vegas. Even so, Republicans refused to even give it a vote.
Do you really believe Sessions will do anything? Very doubtful.
Most likely will never be discussed again, and people will forget.
3752 2018-02-21 12:38:33 Trump's move to ban bump stocks isn't such a big loss to the gun world practically, but it's a compromise with the gun grabbers & that isn't good. Now they'll push even harder for more restrictions & bans, give them an inch & they'll want a mile.
3753 2018-02-21 12:38:27 No band on bump stocks!
We will not give up one inch of our gun rights.
The Democrats will not vote for you regardless what compromises you might give them.
3754 2018-02-21 12:38:20 Hi Sophia. We are very sorry to hear this. Kindly visit your nearest MANGO store which stocks the MANGO Man range and explain the issue to one of our managers who will inspect the tie and advise you further. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused. Kind regards.
3755 2018-02-21 12:38:13 I'm fine with banning bump stocks but again the AR15 is just a semi automatic rifle. It's not the issue.
3756 2018-02-21 12:38:08 How will this EO on Bump Stocks stop me from printing them on my new and improved 3D Printer Mr. President??? Don't fall for their nonsense. You are a much smarter man than that sir. @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr

3765 2018-02-21 12:37:15 Really? And bump stocks and tighter controls on semi automatic rifles too.  Seriously, you’re going to do something?
3766 2018-02-21 12:37:08 Then I suggest you use your platform to SUPPORT THE USE OF BUMP STOCKS! The left is so predictable! If Trump had banned all weapons you would have condemned the move as unconstitutional!
3767 2018-02-21 12:36:45 Please don't cave to the liberals about gun laws, bump stocks & background checks! We need to execute the laws already on the books! That's why we voted for you & we love you! Execute murderers put metal detectors in all schools, allow the teachers to be armed!

3772 2018-02-21 12:35:27 Even the NRA agrees that bump stocks should not be legal.
3773 2018-02-21 12:34:26 Banning bump stocks is not a bad idea . Mr. President .
3774 2018-02-21 12:34:18 Banning bumps stocks is the "thoughts and prayers" of legislation.  It makes people feel good but in the end it doesn't really do much.
3775 2018-02-21 12:34:18 Would hope that it would make a difference for the better. There is no reason why bump stocks are even available or needed

3786 2018-02-21 12:31:32 I see. So when you travel and have access to your bank account back home then you're screwed as well. 

Same for stocks, you can't travel and own stocks on a broker you have access to.

3791 2018-02-21 12:30:30 GP "President Trump on Tuesday ordered the Justice Department to propose a ban on “bump stocks,” which make semi-automatic guns more lethal." <= NYT
3792 2018-02-21 12:30:26 The NRA better pull their stocks out of their butts and look at what's trending. They may end up on the trash heap of history!
3793 2018-02-21 12:30:11 You do realize that the regulations regarding Bump Stocks have already been subject to extensive review, so it should not take the DOJ more than a day or two to revise the interpretive rules if this is not just another Trump con.
3794 2018-02-21 12:30:08 The banning of bump stocks would be a slippery slope. We cannot give the left an inch. As it won't stop just at bump stocks @realDonaldTrump #2A #GunRights #bumpstocks
3795 2018-02-21 12:30:08 Finally, all this happened before the notorious LV maaasacre during which it bevcame immediately obvious to every sane person that bump stocks should be illegal. Trump was president then, and now finally 5 months later is taking the right first steps.
3796 2018-02-21 12:29:51 It’s been 7 days since #Parkland. All the president can do is look at a ban on bump stocks. Which weren’t used at Parkland. How about reinstitute the Assault Weapons ban, to ban the gun used in Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, and other shootings, @realDonaldTrump?
3797 2018-02-21 12:29:48 Weakliest: @realDonaldTrump & Florida legislature fail to ban semi-automatic weapons. Ban on bump stocks thrown as a scrap to divert attention from the fact that they're all pimped out to the @NRA
3798 2018-02-21 12:29:31 automatic weapons are not legal... that's why bump stocks were invented: to mimic automatic fire.
3799 2018-02-21 12:29:16 I agree about the bump stocks...
I’m really ticked at what twitter did last night....

3800 2018-02-21 12:29:15 Dude, we see through your motives. We want stricter background checks, banned AR  and bump stocks and more. You toss bits and claim compromise. Not going to work anymore.
3801 2018-02-21 12:28:54 @realDonaldTrump Please do NOT ban bump stocks. You do not want/need to be the one who set precedent that unravels 2nd Amendment.
3802 2018-02-21 12:28:47 @cameron_kasky The @NRA lets its @GOP lackies and @POTUS  talk waiting periods, expanded background checks, and banning  bump stocks, but that's their low-ball offer, what they'd give to break the momentum of #NeverAgain and #MarchForOurLives... Aspire higher. #BanAssaultWeapons
3803 2018-02-21 12:28:07 This will do nothing. Ban on bump fire stocks will do nothing. Ban on semi auto rifles will do nothing. Our current laws aren’t enforced and crazies loaded up on anti depressants are still allowed to purchase guns. Enforce what we have be4 adding more laws. #GunLaws #2A #FBIKnew
3804 2018-02-21 12:27:52 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
3805 2018-02-21 12:27:37 Obama didn’t “approve” anything. There were two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
3806 2018-02-21 12:27:10 The 2nd Amendment will NEVER go away! Mental Health is a serious issue that needs NOW resources, priority & change. #POTUS45 is for improved background checks & banning of bump stocks IMO AR15s etc... probably need to go, ALL schools should be better protected & kids supported

3809 2018-02-21 12:26:11 Trump is banning bump stocks because it's the one thing the NRA will let the GOP ban without holding back campaign contributions in 2018. Also Trump and his supporters can go in front of cameras and claim they did something about mass shootings.

3812 2018-02-21 12:25:27 You are such a BS artist! Those students are going to spearhead a movement that will oust Republicans from the House & Senate. Your staff made you see that background checks should be addressed...after your awful Presser about bump stocks and DOJ. These teens are saying bring it!
3813 2018-02-21 12:25:24 Now I have to take that same money out to be ready for the taxes owed on it next year. It is a scam. You added trillions to the national debt all to give big business and top percent money that allow them to do whatever they want with it., like buy back stocks, pad overseas accts

3815 2018-02-21 12:24:40 So, I guess Trump thinks by outlawing bump-stocks it will make semi-autos less lethal. Does he not realize a semi-automatic rifle will fire a shot with every squeeze of the trigger even without a bump-stock? What a childish, idiotic, pathetic, dumbass excuse for a human being!
3816 2018-02-21 12:24:32 .@realDonaldTrump Show us your tax returns...and your idea on banning bump stocks is only the tip of the iceberg. Sort of like Kushner’s problems with his security clearance...which reminds me: WHY is he and Ivanka even in the WH when they do NOTHING useful?
3817 2018-02-21 12:24:24 Bump stocks don’t make a semi auto full auto, It increases the rate of ordinary fire. Language Matters!

3822 2018-02-21 12:23:50 @realDonaldTrump don’t stop at bump stocks ban all assault weapons to civilians. Please. #gunsense #GunReform #AR15 #SchoolShootings
3823 2018-02-21 12:23:43 Banning bump stocks and other modifications won't do anything when people can easily create their own homemade modifications.
3824 2018-02-21 12:23:39 @realDonaldTrump We give up Bump stocks and we get to bring God back into schools! A novelty for something that's been lacking in society, which in the end is the real problem! Sorry but the right is built on a foundation of Christian values, while the left is majority atheist.
3825 2018-02-21 12:23:33 Nein. Dem Vernehmen nach hat man sich in den Sanitärräumen des zwanzigsten Stocks verschanzt und hält gut gesichert zwischen Brille, Bürste und Rolle eine kabinenübergreifende Krisensitzung ab.

3828 2018-02-21 12:22:19 Trump... prohibiting bump stocks won’t uphold a shooter to kill people. You’re thinking in the white direction, not in the right direction...
3829 2018-02-21 12:22:09 Bump stocks would’ve been passed by almost any administration, on a legal technicality. Stop over simplifying to suit your agenda. What about Congress blocking reform after Newtown?
3830 2018-02-21 12:22:03 ATF (under Obama) previously found a ban on bump stocks was not legal since it did not alter the weapon.

3832 2018-02-21 12:21:41 Now that POTUS has expressed a desire to ban bump stocks, will bump stocks be banned?
3833 2018-02-21 12:21:24 Not just bump stocks but civilians purchasing military style weapons also need to be banned. There are some many other guns for civilians to own we don't need military style weapons.  Theres age requirements to do many things and there should be one in order to purchase a weapon.
3834 2018-02-21 12:21:00 Yes Tomi, take your bible, your AR-15 /bumper stocks (God Forbid their ban) and go spread the word!
3835 2018-02-21 12:20:56 There's zero real world need for bump stocks. At least raise the age for buying guns like the AR15 so those kids whom you say aren't even mature enough to protest can't buy them

3838 2018-02-21 12:20:49 Pres. Trump says he's signed a memo directing the Dept. of Justice to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.  More on that at 6:34 on @morningedition.
3839 2018-02-21 12:20:44 I am a Republican from west central Pennsylvania. I support a ban on bump stocks, enhanced background checks, and passing a law that allows no one under the age of 29 to purchase an AR 15 type weapon. I also support limiting the magazine clip to six cartridges.
3840 2018-02-21 12:20:03 So, it took students storming out of school yesterday to get the orange shitgibbon to "talk about" banning bump stocks.  @realDonaldTrump is all talk and no action.
3841 2018-02-21 12:19:30 You forgot he put a ban on bump stocks which weren’t even used in the #Floridaschoolshooting. But were in the Vegas shooting. Why not outlaw them then? Why do we need semi-automatic weapons? Why do we do more to get to drive a car then get a gun? #GunControl

3843 2018-02-21 12:19:17 Obama approved  these bum stocks that the Vegas shooter used to kill 58 pple and wounded 500. 2 different gun stocks do u think he took money from NRA?? Weather it’s done at a concert or our schools pple were killed Trump will listen and he’s just not a stand around a do nothing
3844 2018-02-21 12:19:06 The GOP is trying to muddy the waters with a push to ban bump stocks...while good and much overdo there is much much more that needs to be done.
3845 2018-02-21 12:18:55 There are three names that I can honestly say plotted very important dots together for me in swing trading stocks...Mr. Ed Riley is at the top! Thank you Ed!

3849 2018-02-21 12:18:05 @MSNBC The answer is we don’t need AR 15’s military assault weapons in Civilain hands, the bump stocks the mental test is a waste of time, ban AR 15’s ban military assault weapons, stop killing children. The NRA has the Republican Party by the balls.
3850 2018-02-21 12:17:46 WEDNESDAY: @POTUS is beginning to take on gun regulations. The first step is pushing to ban bump stocks. This as Parkland teens descend on their state Capitol in Tallahasee, FL and demand action. More at 9 AM EST with @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox.
3851 2018-02-21 12:16:08 I like those old pics of clergyman in deckchairs at the beach wearing their bib stocks
3852 2018-02-21 12:15:47 proving trump has NO intention of banning or even limiting assault weapons- he stated  they will ban bump stocks or anything that will modify LEGAL WEAPONS" .
 that says -AR-15/AK-47s are safe in the republican world.
3853 2018-02-21 12:15:28 I'm just over here wondering why @realDonaldTrump didn't call for a ban on bump stocks after one was used in #LasVegas ?? Not that I believe he will follow through anyway.
3854 2018-02-21 12:15:10 About freaking time! And ban the AR-15 and bump stocks while u are at it. Ooh, and how about if you take that 31 million $ the NRA gave you and donate it to @Everytown or to families devastated by gun violence????  #Parkland #columbine #sanbernadino #LasVegas

3858 2018-02-21 12:15:00 A ban on bump stocks would have reduced casualties in Vegas, but would not have had any effect on Sandy Hook or Parkland. Let’s be serious and demand more than a bandaid on this gaping wound. Ban assault weapons. Close the gun show loophole.
3859 2018-02-21 12:14:41 Banning bump stocks is a no brainer and should have been done month ago. You are going to have to do much better than this. Americans have had enough! We demand stricter gun laws NOW!
3860 2018-02-21 12:14:06 What are bump stocks?
3861 2018-02-21 12:13:40 Quick question: if trump can DIRECT Sessions to “ban bump stocks”, can he DIRECT him to investigate something like Clinton..even tho Sessions is silent and way ahead?
3862 2018-02-21 12:13:38 @realDonaldTrump The move to ban bump stocks is a cowardly decision because it is the one met with least resistance. We do not need to own assault weapons for personal protection.  Their sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.
3863 2018-02-21 12:13:11 Not a Dem vs. Rep issue.
At minimum, effective background checks, ban on AR-15 and bump stocks.
3864 2018-02-21 12:12:19 You must own stocks in the insurance business! Insurance does not stop someone from getting a gun and killing people. I’m surprised at you shilling this crap.
3865 2018-02-21 12:12:18 @realDonaldTrump 's "ideas",  ... he makes a lot of noise, but, Justice was already reviewing a bump stocks ban via regulation.  Background checks already on the books.  No new initiatives.  No guidance on education.
3866 2018-02-21 12:11:59 Wow, a ban on bump stocks will totally stop this idiocy
3867 2018-02-21 12:11:50 If you are serious, you will be looking at a doing a lot more than banning bump stocks. Close the gun show loophole immediately.
3868 2018-02-21 12:11:49 #filmfeb 21: For Color, the Tetanal Kit is good: 30 rolls for $20? Nice. I had bad luck with their E6 chems going off too quickly for my liking.. unreasonable expectations? For b/w, D76, Ilfotec HC & Rodinal. I like what I get from Rodinal, especially w/ Ilford stocks.
3869 2018-02-21 12:11:38 Bum Stocks are a modification to a rifle that essentially allows it to fire like a machinegun...
3870 2018-02-21 12:10:59 Now that bumpfire stocks and the constitution are banned we can dispense with the FumblingBumblingIdiots Everyones safe now
3871 2018-02-21 12:10:27 @DavidAWelter We need better gun control now. 70% of the American public would like to see a ban on assault weapons. Let’s ban bump stocks. That’s a no-brainer. I’m seeing a lot of you blowing your own horn but no action on gun control
3872 2018-02-21 12:10:16 Prediction: the so-called ban on bump stocks will be nothing of the sort. It will produce a huge black market in the easily produced bump stocks, while doing nothing – absolutely nothing — to avert or prevent school massacres and other gun violence.
3873 2018-02-21 12:10:13 ATF said bump stocks can only be banned by legislation after ER Vegas. 45’s playing us...again. Wake the fuck up, pundits!
3874 2018-02-21 12:09:59 A public traded STOCK company is not the same as a public company their stocks are available to the general public to buy and god again read more by law they are only accountable to their stock owners 


3875 2018-02-21 12:09:27 Let’s start by banning bump stocks, using the no fly list in addition to background checks for sales, include a pre-sale screening people with a history of mental health issues, puttting metal detectors in schools like we do for concerts, sporting events, etc.
3876 2018-02-21 12:09:19 He's calling for tougher background checks and getting rid of bump stocks what more do you want banning guns? Haha don't make me laugh snowflakes will ALWAYS complain he's in the wrong.
3877 2018-02-21 12:09:10 Yeah, ban all semi-autos, the AR-15 just an example. Bump stocks need to be banned also. Yes, the "2nd Amendment" the clue's in the Fucking name, it can be amended! We banned slavery,gave women the vote, society moves on. Holding onto dogma,which has little meaning now, for what?
3878 2018-02-21 12:09:00 Trump pushes for a ban on bump stocks more than four months after the massacre in Las Vegas. 

Makes sense now that a school shooting that didn't involve a bump stock happened.
3879 2018-02-21 12:08:54 Glad to see @realDonaldTrump taking a stance on bump stocks on these assault weapons
3880 2018-02-21 12:08:44 The @NRA lets its @GOP lackies and obedient @POTUS talk about waiting periods, expanded background checks, and banning bump stocks, but that's their low-ball offer, what they'd give to break the  momentum of #NeverAgain and #MarchForOurLives... #BanAssaultWeapons #GunControlNow
3881 2018-02-21 12:08:13 Sir do you track penny stocks? Like SPYL. It's been doing great volumes since few days. But stock price hasnt moved much. Wanted your insight. Thank you
3882 2018-02-21 12:07:49 I'm not on the gun control train so it's not a concern for me. Bump stocks aren't even an issue, really.
3883 2018-02-21 12:07:48 @CNNPolitics The President wants to ban bump stocks. Bump stocks don't kill people! It's what bumps stocks are connected to ( guns ) that kill people. Ban the assult weapons. That's another way Trump  dragging his feet.
3884 2018-02-21 12:07:17 It’s only because of intense pressure that you are doing this. We should not have to beg you to protect the lives of our children. Ban bump stocks, assault weapons & high capacity magazines whose only purpose is mass murder. Waiting to see if you choose life over NRA money.
3885 2018-02-21 12:07:04 They got private jets I got a coconut. 

They have beach houses I have an island bungalow.

They have 5-star chefs I have 10 fingers.

They have stocks I have stacks.

They have happiness I have genuine happiness.
3886 2018-02-21 12:07:02 But don't you see that they can apply the same reasoning to mags? Why do you need 10,25,100 round magazines? Even though we both may like Trump, he won't always be pres. So why ban the bump stock? We need to fight this creeping tyranny!  It won't stop with bump stocks.
3887 2018-02-21 12:06:55 Correspondent Bob Costantini joins us at the bottom of the hour from Washington DC to talk about the President's order to the Justice Department to ban "bump stocks."
3888 2018-02-21 12:06:46 mdr ça donne envie de dévaliser les stocks
3889 2018-02-21 12:06:25 Good for market. He can move stocks.
3890 2018-02-21 12:06:19 Democrats have been pushing background checks since obama. Also bump stocks were supposed to be banned after the las vegas massacre. GOP is to blame
3891 2018-02-21 12:06:09 @realDonaldTrump It's great you saying you support stronger background checks & banning bump stocks. But you've said you would support bills in the past you later rejected ( DACA). How can we believe you?
3892 2018-02-21 12:05:43 A couple of new stocks showed up in my screen yesterday, one was from Zimbabwe. I’m not to confident about that so I better update the screen....
3893 2018-02-21 12:05:39 @CBSThisMorning speaking of bump-stocks @GayleKing why haven't you found out more info on the #LasVegasShooting?
#tcot #NRA
3894 2018-02-21 12:05:34 Imagine looking back thirty years from now and seeing that our best response to the recurring mass slaughter of children was to... ban bump stocks. Tinker at the margins of background checks. Implement brief waiting periods.
Shamefully, pathetically inadequate.
#RepealThe2nd
3895 2018-02-21 12:05:26 NRA doesn’t like bump stocks either. Win-win? No crying foul @realDonaldTrump
3896 2018-02-21 12:05:22 CBS News. The Orange Racist says we have to do “real” fixes. Remember how far banning bump stocks got?

If the NRA does not approve any legislation about guns then there’s no way the GOP will let it happen.
3897 2018-02-21 12:05:05 Stocks can hurt your heart too
3898 2018-02-21 12:05:01 Guess I wasn’t clear. I was suggesting Sessions proceed at prosecuting a bump stock ban at the same speed Killary is being prosecuted which is a snails pace or not at all. At that pace, Killary will have died and bump stocks will be obsolete when the prosecution is complete.
3899 2018-02-21 12:04:22 And just to clarify  ‘’bump stocks’’  are ILLEGAL genius
3900 2018-02-21 12:04:21 NO STOCKSさんのパートナーの方は幸せですね(^_^)貴方は正しい方なんですね。心に残るリプライ、感謝します。
3901 2018-02-21 12:03:57 The reason bump stocks won't get banned is because idiots like Dork Dianne Feinstein will have so many other things such as those dangerous barrel shrouds attached to the bill. "You know the shoulder thing that goes up!"
3902 2018-02-21 12:03:39 Bump stocks are fun but they have no practical value. Trump threw them a meaningless bone.
3903 2018-02-21 12:03:07 Imagine looking back thirty years from now and seeing that our best response to the recurring mass slaughter of children was to... ban bump stocks. Tinker at the margins of background checks. Implement brief waiting periods.

3905 2018-02-21 11:59:51 ATF can’t legally ban “bump stocks,” even by executive order. They’re not firearms. Only Congress can pass legislation to outlaw these devices (which were not used in the recent Florida mass shooting). #guns #FloridaSchoolShooting

3907 2018-02-21 11:58:56 The @NRA, its @GOP lackies and obedient @POTUS pay lip service to banning bump stocks and expanded background checks, but that is their low-ball offer, what they might give to break the momentum of #NeverAgain and #MarchForOurLives... #BanAssaultWeapons #GunControlNow
3908 2018-02-21 11:58:27 They should have outlawed bump stocks after the Vegas shootings. This is Trump's attempt to do the least possible and still say they are making GREAT progress with gun control.
3909 2018-02-21 11:57:59 Sen Rubio is very brave. How many politicians so brazenly ignore the will of the people (background checks, assault weapons ban, bump-stocks, etc.) to maintain NRA rating and funding.
3910 2018-02-21 11:57:35 Then I guess you would agree almost as good as the group of lawmakers who voted down loopholes for folks on watch lists to not get access to guns, or limiting mental healthcare or not even addressing bump stocks, background checks, limited ammo or ban military style weapons.
3911 2018-02-21 11:57:33 Don't fall for Trump's bullshit smokescreen on bump stocks. Keep up the pressure for a total ban on assault style weapons!
3912 2018-02-21 11:56:46 There has been 1 mass shooting using bump stocks.  Maybe 1% of the murders in this country are committed using AR-15s.  The vast majority  are committed by criminals using illegal handgun. So the left says pass new laws and don't enforce existing laws on illegal handguns.
3913 2018-02-21 11:56:20 Our economy is doing better, stocks and jobs are a good indicator. Is this because of Trump? Trickle down? Stroke of luck? Not quite sure, but hope we can still keep it going.

#pardonourpolitics #economy
3914 2018-02-21 11:55:25 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Like 2 commend & thank you 4 considering banning bump stocks & a deeper look into background checks for gun ownership. Please keep an open mind to all the options. I have a school age child. Please put our Safety 1st! Thank you!
3915 2018-02-21 11:55:21 But Robert have a heart. Some of these people have berokers on speed dial to sell stocks at present price with other people's money than buy when companies shares reach a lower price. A nice little earner. Only pension money anyway to take a hit. And a crashing company.
3916 2018-02-21 11:55:18 It's harder to aim when using a typical belt loop to simulate fully automatic firing. Bump stocks allow any novice to fire his AR-15 about as accurately as an actual fully automatic weapon

3919 2018-02-21 11:53:59 The bump stock doesn't even modify the gun. You still have to physically squeeze the trigger for each fire.

Under the Obama Administration the ATF already approved the Bump Stocks. It would be a shock to the base if they reverse that under Trump. i.e. slippery slope.
3920 2018-02-21 11:53:29 Very good point and a calculated answer.  Infact there is no need for panic selling of bank stocks at this time.
3921 2018-02-21 11:53:11 I'm glad I live in one of the more progressive and proactive states.
Massachusetts already banned bump stocks within days after the Las Vegas massacre.

3924 2018-02-21 11:52:07 I agree we need a ban on assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. however, I have friends in the NRA, and where I do not agree with their views, calling Americans “child murderers” is not the way to debate this. Let’s try and be civil while we debate.

3929 2018-02-21 11:49:49 He thinks he already TOOK it by banning the bump stocks. 
A car can plow into a group of protesters, and Trump would say, “I’m going to ban the turbo charged engine,” completely ignoring the 1,500 lb. vehicle that did the job.

3939 2018-02-21 11:46:25 let's see what is the least step, oh yes bump stocks. No Mr. President there are some good people who need guns for protecting the country and civil society, these are law enforcement and military. The rest of us with guns need to forget our paranoia and trust them notthe NRA.
3940 2018-02-21 11:44:24 Perhaps you recall the two weeks of coverage of a push to ban bump stocks immediately post-Vegas?

All teachers must have right to carry-concealed, sign contract that protectionll be on person at all times while at school, less chance of theft1/3
3945 2018-02-21 11:42:49 opinion - trumps late night  suggested ban on bump stocks is a decision he endorses (grudgingly) as an appeasement to the 97% opposed to assault weapons, I'm willing to bet 3 weeks ago he had no clue what a bump stock is- or what it does, still doesn't.
3946 2018-02-21 11:42:44 -45 is only willing to talk about this "banning bump-stocks" because the NRA was already considering it. They needed a cheap thing to sacrifice rather than what we really need which is massive gun reform and a ban on assault weapons. It has nothing to do with the victims.
3947 2018-02-21 11:42:35 Well, Trump didn't ban anything (he couldn't, of course). He announced that he's directing that banning bump stocks should be "looked at"
3948 2018-02-21 11:42:30 What’s wrong #MSM? Where are the stories letting the world know #POTUS is banning bump stocks? Doesn’t fit your #anti-Trump narrative? That’s ok. #POTUS will tell the world and show once again that you are #RagMags with an agenda. #Protest #MSM #CNN #FakeNewsMedia
3949 2018-02-21 11:42:29 Now this guy's thinking about bump stocks! Trump's officially too dumb to qualify as an old man 
3950 2018-02-21 11:41:56 It’s nice to see players know when they weren’t up to par. Overall been a great player this season though. KRO stocks 
3951 2018-02-21 11:41:54 Banning bump stocks seems a bit empty as I don’t think the school shooter used one. The Las Vegas shooter did but that was 5 months ago & it wasn’t the right time to talk about it then.
3952 2018-02-21 11:41:31 I’m fine with (and supportive of) Trump moving to ban bump stocks, but that nothing to stop deadly shootings with AR-15s.
3953 2018-02-21 11:41:06 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks: A great thing bump stocks should have been banned long already! Certainly don't need that to hunt with!
3954 2018-02-21 11:40:58 Ban bump stocks? Looks like we’re shopping for m4’s from the market then.
3955 2018-02-21 11:40:55 I'm gonna be real with you I don't give a shit about bump stocks if they ban them they ban them it's a cheap gimmick toy you can bump without one so its honestly stupid to ban them but if it shuts some people up it's nothing to me

3959 2018-02-21 11:39:53 Regulate bump stocks? What is the possible legal use for transforming a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic weapon. The is B's.
3960 2018-02-21 11:39:45 Bump stocks? From a gun owner here? They should have never been legal anyway! AR  style guns?
Don’t own, need or want one.

3962 2018-02-21 11:38:51 So bump stocks will get banned now & Republicans/Trump will claim that they managed to effect some form of gun control where the Dems/Obama failed. Nevermind the fact that the formers have always resisted/blocked any previous efforts. #Hypocrites #MarchForOurLives
3963 2018-02-21 11:38:43 @POTUS I've enjoyed Bump Stocks for years and never shot anyone with it!  Most didn't know what they were until Vegas. Thanks for making criminals out of all of us.
3964 2018-02-21 11:38:40 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
3965 2018-02-21 11:38:01 #morningjoe When #Trump says he'll B banning Bump Stocks "Really Soon", that means NEVER. He's HOPING Parkland will go away or he'll cause a diversion 2 MAKE it go away. The Wh Supremacy wing of his base, kooks who wanna take over ,  will B very unhappy if he touches guns.

3971 2018-02-21 11:37:02 58 die and more than 400 wounded in Las Vegas by a man using a gun equipped with a bump stock. Ban on bump stocks? No.

3972 2018-02-21 11:36:56 90% of the country is in favor of common sense gun laws, yet Randy can’t even commit to voting for ANY gun regulation. I’ve been calling about bump stocks for months, and he hasn’t even budged on that issue. He is completely beholden to his NRA donors.
3973 2018-02-21 11:36:18 And considering banning bump stocks is a tiny band-aid to be slapped on a punctured artery.
3974 2018-02-21 11:36:03 Look at the sales of bump stocks after Los Vegas shooting when gun owners of America thought they would be banned.
3975 2018-02-21 11:35:52 Floridians don’t blame you directly, we know you’re weak & highly susceptible to NRA influences. Remind us on your positions/votes on bump-stocks, gun show loop holes, CDC gun violence research, repealing Obama sales restrictions to mentally ill? @FLGovScott

3977 2018-02-21 11:35:32 It dont matter though Mr Molyneux .. thats not the point , the point is , it looks as if someone is doing something proactive lol the ones that want bump stocks banned dont have a clue what they even are lol
3978 2018-02-21 11:35:16 ... pres probably thinks its the perfect time to buy bump "stocks"....
3979 2018-02-21 11:35:04 Totally agree, but if assault weapons are banned those bump stocks have no purpose.
3980 2018-02-21 11:34:48 @superpixels did i hear you say bump stocks were used in parkland shooting? i had not heard that
i may be confused with las vegas
3981 2018-02-21 11:34:33 Republicans are also behind the accepting of money from NRA, and are guilty of not PROTECTING citizens of America, therefore neglecting the duty you are put in office for. You are also behind the sales of silentcers, this instrument used for criminal activity and bump stocks also

3984 2018-02-21 11:32:49 Bump fire stocks are a fun way to burn through ammo. No one is going to fight a ban, but we should get something in return for the deal.
3985 2018-02-21 11:32:03 巴马的时候也讨论过禁bump stocks，最后提案被民主党否了。
3986 2018-02-21 11:31:57 From what I've been seeing, it seems bump stocks are shit-tier awfulness and it seems to be a thing that make it SEEM like Trump is doing something involving gun control. So technically I guess it's fine?
3987 2018-02-21 11:31:45 Considering bump stocks were supposed to have been banned after Las Vegas, it’s an insult
3988 2018-02-21 11:31:40 10 bucks says literally nothing happens. Doll Hands does a big-boy photo-op yesterday and the media took the bait as per usual. All he said was ‘I wrote a memo so we can look at banning bump stocks’.  A memo? Come on now.
3989 2018-02-21 11:31:35 Congratulations to #Trump on his proposal to ban bump stocks. He has been so indecisive about doing this. It should have happened after Las Vegas. 
He needs to stop being indecisive and inept about taking stronger action. #FloridaShooting #GunControlNow #FloridaHouse
3990 2018-02-21 11:30:53 its a negotiation marker. It will be watered down to bump stocks then it will be crushed in the senate
3991 2018-02-21 11:30:52 I'll pray daily for BigBang to leave and start their own company, They deserve respect and recognition for everything they achieved not for their records to be hidden in the dungeon and only brought up when YG wanna save his stocks to hype his other groups.
3992 2018-02-21 11:30:40 If bump stocks didn’t have a use case they wouldn’t exist at all.
3993 2018-02-21 11:30:16 Trump pushing to ban bump stocks, about time. Shoulda been done after Vegas
3994 2018-02-21 11:30:12 Seems like he's a mass tragedy behind the times.

Bump stocks were the issue with the last one. This one was about a troubled 19 yr old able to buy an assault rifle with no wait and no background check issues before killing 17 of his former classmates.
3995 2018-02-21 11:29:28 “Bump stocks” are a silly add-on accessory and have zero to do with any “gun” reform.  This is a distractive/useless proposal to make it appear “something” is being done.  It’s like banning, I don’t know, add-ons to a car that make it go faster than 65 MPH................
3996 2018-02-21 11:29:21 Was there a ban on bump stocks or is this fake news? @scrowder
3997 2018-02-21 11:28:08 Sounds like Trump is cramming for your listening mtng today. Bump stocks regulation news today. Background checks yesterday. It's It's a start but NOT enough. Banning ALL ARs would be needed. Keep the faith. Many are fighting with you.
3998 2018-02-21 11:27:04 Trading stocks is a fun fun game
3999 2018-02-21 11:26:00 Truth: Trump did not approve of bump stocks. Obama did. Trump has directed the Dept of Justice to propose a rule, "as expeditiously as possible." re: Bush- quickly outlawed them & he was long gone before OBAMA approved, never outlawed, & they remained legal throughout his prez
4000 2018-02-21 11:25:58 If we can't be honest enough to say that bump stocks are designed to circumvent the laws against automatic weapons, then how do we have the integrity we claim to have?
4001 2018-02-21 11:25:45 Uggghhh tell your circle to stop lying to you. Wal-Mart stocks crash to poor earning causing more layoffs,  Applbees and IHOP each closing over 100 restaurants due to decline.... how are those mainstreeters going to pay their bills? Get off FOX and have someone read to you
4002 2018-02-21 11:25:40 @TheLastLeg, #Isitok to question whether or not @realDonaldTrump has only done the bare minimum (of asking for bump stocks to be banned), because it has almost no chance of passing?
4003 2018-02-21 11:25:25 Banning bump stocks is hardly caving on gun control.  Guessing the Romney endorsement is a “pick one’s battles” situation.  Almost zero chance that Romney doesn’t win Utah.
4004 2018-02-21 11:24:59 Trump has directed a ban on all Bump Stocks and other full-auto conversion devices for semi-autos. Still no word from democrats approving his actions in a better direction. Can nobody give credit where due? This is why I dislike Republicans and Democrats. Childish.
4005 2018-02-21 11:24:48 a lot of haters of any missed move. coins, stocks, anything ! losers 
4006 2018-02-21 11:23:44 #morningjoe @JoeNBC Trump NEVER said "eliminating sale of assault weapons". Joe's gonna have to walk that back in the next segment. Watch, he'll reiterate & prop up the WH meme instead again: 'ban bump stocks & background checks'
4007 2018-02-21 11:23:40 Where was Trump after Vegas when Feinstein went after bump stocks? Cruz wasn't using one. Late to the game. Worried about ignorant base. #TheDishonorableDonaldTrump
4008 2018-02-21 11:23:38 Only federal legislation will work to ban bump stocks. This is just another Trump stunt.

4013 2018-02-21 11:21:51 BTW....the AR 15 is semi Automatic and can easily be modified by bump stocks. Something the GOP said they would do After the Vegas Massacre. Nothing was done. Nothing. And here we are again.
4014 2018-02-21 11:21:38 I commend the students wanting to try and change things. I agree that bump stocks and other automatic guns shouldn't be in any civilians hands.
4015 2018-02-21 11:20:55 There has been only 3 Machine Gun shootings since 1934 so why worry about Bump stocks?

4019 2018-02-21 11:19:19 #morningjoe @JoeNBC Wait a minute! Bump stocks?? Trump/NRA/GOP is sterring the convo there now? Did the Parkland, FL shooter have a bump stock? NO!! He did HAVE an assault rifle regardless! But BAN those? Nah. See, how they do.... #JustbBumpStocksNotEnough
4020 2018-02-21 11:19:09 Korrekt. Was durch den legalen Erwerb von Bump Stocks aber umgangen wird. Wir werden sehen was passiert.
4021 2018-02-21 11:18:44 @JayarJackson You're 100% right.

They're not gonna ban bump stocks in Congress. The Executive could issue a regulation. I doubt they will, but that's the only realistic option. 

The fact that Trump passed the buck almost certainly means they won't.
4022 2018-02-21 11:18:33 Thanks. I’m wondering what this’ll do to twitter stocks since #MAGA pushed them to profitability first time ever last year #TwitterLockout #TwitterLockout #WednesdayWTF

4024 2018-02-21 11:18:26 Yea if he would only get that mental health check back he repealed. By the way bumper stocks were not used in Florida. ALL officials need better they all need to work on something. Not a take away, but end this. I wish I had all the answers but it won’t be solved on Twitter
4025 2018-02-21 11:17:35 Why am I hearing you banned "bump stocks"? Hope this isn't true. @realDonaldTrump
4026 2018-02-21 11:17:23 Put the NRA out of business by creating a saner gun organization. 100 million gun owners, only 4 million in NRA. Get the sane people into an org that represents those against bump stocks, against assault rifles, FOR background checks #NeverAgain #KillTheNRA
4027 2018-02-21 11:17:12 Ban bump stocks, AR15, close gun show loopholes, regulate interstate, improve database. All long overdue.

4033 2018-02-21 11:14:32 Law makers have a lot of blood in their hands and still refuse to change gun laws. Their focus is money , money , and shutting the government down. They still selling bump stocks and AR-15. Why Americans so obsessed with guns.

4035 2018-02-21 11:13:21 Banning bump stocks isn't nearly enough. Ban the AR 15, which is an unnecessary killing machine. #MorningJoe stop lovin' up on DT again.
4036 2018-02-21 11:13:16 Gun control should be immediate .  While politicians are flapping their jaws people are probably buying up all the bump stocks they can find .  ?  What about the bump stocks that are already out there ?  ?  ?
4037 2018-02-21 11:12:25 बढ़ा चढ़ा stocks & housing are exceptions.

now lender enjoy on same asset interest 10 times with a 10 time  bubbled price asset.
if same goes on ,
some where bubble to burst.
4038 2018-02-21 11:12:22 Yeah. I've been waiting for the health and criminal databases to be merged for some time. Mental health concerns will be the tip of the spear, I expect. But meanwhile I'll I've seen from Trump is a move to ban bump stocks. Which is perfect.
4039 2018-02-21 11:12:08 It's already illegal to convert semi-automatic firearms to full automatic.  Bump stocks got past the regulations by manufacturers lying about what their device does.  Someone should go to jail.

4043 2018-02-21 11:09:41 @morningmika @joenbc To ban bump stocks is a start, no however, Trump is doing this because the NRA agrees. I want trump to go further, eliminate the sales of semi and automatic sales, limit to guns a person can have, background checks, close all loop holes, trump won’t watch!
4044 2018-02-21 11:09:10 1 of 2
Reasonable gun reform:
 Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, large clips, large ammo buys
 Background checks
 No one with history of violence, especially domestic violence, can buy/own
 One week or more waiting period
 Create national gun registry
4045 2018-02-21 11:08:30 Three things I can say about Indian stock market action:
1. IT stocks seem super fav sector now - and I am not surprised.
2. Nifty refusing to break the MA support despite bearish headlines
3. Liquidity has come down dramatically
4046 2018-02-21 11:08:09 Getting ready for more market fireworks this week. Looks like a lot of stocks that were running on potential are now being looked at with an FA eye and not stacking up. Always pays to keep an eye out for key dates before taking a trade.
4047 2018-02-21 11:07:58 Long overdue change on bump stocks ?!?! You realize they were originated and approved through OBAMA under the ATF??
4048 2018-02-21 11:07:52 Are you going to give Trump credit for his stance on bump stocks? Or is this a strictly partisan, virtue signaling endeavor for you?

4050 2018-02-21 11:07:04 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks were a compromise to outlawing semi-auto.  Take bump stocks away plays into Dems hands to disarm America against 2nd amendment @KrisParonto
4051 2018-02-21 11:06:57 The NRA agreed that the bump stocks should be banned. Donald Trump is also proposing a ban on all items that turn a semi-automatic into a fully automatic.
4052 2018-02-21 11:06:30 Just tuned in to @Morning_Joe, since the horror seems to be talking about bump stocks & background checks- have they opened up a spot on Mt Rushmore yet?
4053 2018-02-21 11:06:17 Let’s see how many people fall for the WH shenanigans w-regard to gun control. “Trump was moved by the students” “Trump wants to raise the minimum age for gun purchases” “Trump wants to ban bump stocks and increase background checks” etc... remember DACA and health care?
4054 2018-02-21 11:05:59 As Africans with this Modern Education we have attained and the largest Arable land we sit on we still discuss how to feed our selves If you go to US they will tell you that they have food stocks that can last for 100yrs fuel storage that will take them 200 yrs We learnt Nothing
4055 2018-02-21 11:05:15 I find it funny that the first thing you wanted to do was punish @Twitter by selling your stocks. You've  financially supported @Twitter until now? Hypocrite! Conservatives are being cut off everyday. Your late to this party. Sad! #MAGA
4056 2018-02-21 11:05:05 To be clear:
Banning bump stocks is not banning guns
Background checks is not banning guns
Mental health checks is not banning guns
Only banning guns end this
4057 2018-02-21 11:05:02 hope stocks are full
4058 2018-02-21 11:04:42 He’s not my favorite in any capacity, but if trump is talking about banning bump stocks let’s be grateful for the step in the right direction. We can’t solve America’s crisis immediately. It’s an extremely divisive and complex issue let’s remember that
4059 2018-02-21 11:04:36 Mr @POTUS - Bump stocks weren’t involved in FL. The sheriff and FBI FAILED to keep those children safe. If you go after our guns, you will not be re-elected. People failed those children.

Bump stocks and universal background checks don't impact sales of assault weapons which is why NRA will offer them up as a sacrifice. It's a game.

4073 2018-02-21 10:58:55 Trump has been mocked for asking Mar a Lago members what he should do about the Parkland shooting. It's possible that as the massacre hit so close to home they pushed him to ban bump stocks and pursue further gun control. If so, they deserve some credit.
4074 2018-02-21 10:58:34 We don't need bump stocks we real Estate and good paying jobs
4075 2018-02-21 10:58:20 Making bump stocks an NFA regulated item is a reasonable regulatory approach.
4076 2018-02-21 10:56:37 The Fight won't be easy. They will throw you off message with a bone or 2 ( no bump stocks ). Don't give up. None of us will. Vote the bums out of office.

4081 2018-02-21 10:54:21 Is Trump banning bumpfire stocks, increasing background checks a betrayal of the 2A?
4082 2018-02-21 10:52:52 Same, they really are a stain on the club. Made us into proper laughing stocks. Players distancing themselves from the fans. We’re an ongoing joke for pundits et al.
4083 2018-02-21 10:52:08 Bump stocks are a novelty, same effect can be achieved with a belt loop.

4088 2018-02-21 10:49:40 I do.. Bump stocks where allowed because there is a grey area in current regs. Binary triggers are classified as a semi auto trigger assembly because they require a motion of the trigger to fire a round. if you actually read the regs trigger assemblies that are clearly defined.

4091 2018-02-21 10:48:35 Definitely good progress on EU-only stocks, but VERY important to consider that this is a) based on landings (i.e. doesn't consider catches that aren't landed) and b) focusing just on stocks with MSY-based advice (i.e. excluding the majority of stocks without such advice)

4098 2018-02-21 10:44:55 It was their fault.  Why has Trump done nothing about gun laws since the biggest mass shooting in modern Americas history, on his watch in 2017?  Now these kids have been shot, there’s a mention of banning Bump Stocks?
4099 2018-02-21 10:44:29 @BretBaier 
Fox previously reported that a bump stock was NOT used by the Las Vegas shooter, but bump stocks were found in his room.  Last night you said a bump stock WAS used by the shooter.  Which one is correct?

4123 2018-02-21 10:35:01 Weird the story I read said that the President signed the memo to ban bump stocks, I believe his name is... let me check... Donald Trump
4124 2018-02-21 10:34:50 @realDonaldTrump this ban on bump stocks and other objects that don't violate the law or change the way a firearm operates in intolerable and there is no excuse for it.  You should be singing executive orders expanding rights and forcing state to follow federal law.

4127 2018-02-21 10:33:48 Funny... I have not heard you commend your president on the ban of bump-stocks and increase of checks. Now that does not make everything better, but it is a start in the right direction, and more than Dems have ever done?
4128 2018-02-21 10:33:43 I wish for a few conservative billionaires buy out @Twitter stocks. Enough w/ its bias, censoring, purging, anti-conservatives policies that allow liberal free speech but severely restrict conservative views

4134 2018-02-21 10:28:38 I do find it interesting that bump stocks were legalized during Obama administration , but you hear the media say that
4135 2018-02-21 10:28:20 Bump stocks are actually fairly easy to make. You can out law the sale of them but someone can simply make a simple version at home.

4141 2018-02-21 10:25:24 I know I will be criticized over this but, banning bump stocks or any other devices that may cause a weapon to increase its ability to fire more, WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING when someone makes a decision to commit a crime of this magnitude. #Minehasntshotanyone
4142 2018-02-21 10:25:11 Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks'
4143 2018-02-21 10:25:07 @MSNBC The Trump ROBOT appeared Tuesday 20 Feb 2018 and declared that BUMP STOCKS will be regulated.  Hold the phone everybody, wait til the sun comes up, the Trump ROBOT should go back into it's closet, and everything will be denied.
4144 2018-02-21 10:24:51 Replace scene world banks, world Stocks and world economy..."we're heading for an iceberg captain! Don't worry, Stocks float
4145 2018-02-21 10:24:14 With AK-47s used in every mass murder, the bump stocks used only in Las Vegas, I would think we should stop sales of guns of war.
4146 2018-02-21 10:24:11 @Morning_Joe The Trump ROBOT appeared Tuesday 20 Feb 2018 and declared that BUMP STOCKS will be regulated.  Hold the phone everybody, wait til the sun comes up, the Trump ROBOT should go back into it's closet, and everything will be denied.

4148 2018-02-21 10:23:40 I know a place that sells them and still stocks them
4149 2018-02-21 10:23:38 If trump does ban bump stocks then well done to him.
4150 2018-02-21 10:23:22 Trump's banning Bump Stocks is something that should of been banned in the first place
But is the least he could to help fight the growing problem of gun violence
He just wants to look like he's doing something, without REALLY doing anything
4151 2018-02-21 10:23:00 Why didn’t Trump propose the bump stock ban after the Las Vegas shooting? Because the NRA told him not to. The NRA is willing to sacrifice bump stocks now to shut ppl up about banning AR-15s. Problem: it’s too late now.

4153 2018-02-21 10:21:56 @WBTV_News a lot of your recent post have been misleading about guns. These “bump stocks” do not create machine guns. They do increase the rate of fire. Quit referring to them as an assault rifle. Those type of guns are fully automatic and the guns we Citizens can purchase r not
4154 2018-02-21 10:21:42 @Jaduk99 Finally the tables are starting to turn, talkin' 'bout a revolution...coming collapse in Stocks will make Brexit..
4155 2018-02-21 10:20:46 Actually, this is flat out wrong. He called for legislation yesterday banning bump stocks.
4156 2018-02-21 10:19:40 Serious question: How many people actually own bump stocks, or are looking to buy them, as opposed to those who own, or are looking to buy AR-15s?
4157 2018-02-21 10:19:28 More BS from the killer of Native Americans. Bump stocks were NOT MADE LEGAL by the Obama Administration. It was determined that bump stocks were not included under the then regulations.
4158 2018-02-21 10:18:01 So L.Ryan's or Venebles stocks go up?

4161 2018-02-21 10:16:01 He has already expressed inability to pay citing seizure of accounts n stocks as an excuse.Also imploring employers to look for other avenues.The cheek to threaten bankers with damages,can u match/beat him ?
4162 2018-02-21 10:15:59 @realDonaldTrump In addition to bump stocks are you going to look to ban big trucks, pickup trucks, pressure cookers, airplanes, fertilizer? What will this solve? Just another freedom restricted.

4165 2018-02-21 10:14:07 .@JanIsakson of @FishSecretariat raises the key question: there are legal objectives to restore ALL stocks to health. Looking at the positive figures on volume of catches, the industry will be fine; but will the vulnerable stocks be fine? #CFP2020
4166 2018-02-21 10:14:00 Fishermen & anglers want big stocks & big fish and have their part to play #CFP2020
4167 2018-02-21 10:13:47 Think of his endeavours, his strengths. As technology advances, so his strengths become weaknesses. A drone replaces a pilot or a extraction team. A data system like Bloomberg makes stocks a statistical data rich pursuit. JCB or Rolls Royce are full of geeks, not sweating brawn.
4168 2018-02-21 10:13:20 Folks acting like banning bump stocks is going to lead to revocation of 2A. Won't.  When has the US ever had 1 good thing lead to more greatness? I mean, election of 1st black president was supposed to end racism. We'll probably get legal tanks next. So there's that
4169 2018-02-21 10:13:16 Answer my questions.  "sexism" is not an argument.  It does not speak to market behaviour or gender domination of said market.  If there's a market for female writers why is it not being catered to by anyone?
4170 2018-02-21 10:12:32 Same thing with bump stocks. Republicans want them illegal too. Where sides disagree is on suppressors and magazines

4172 2018-02-21 10:12:05 I think bump stocks are stupid, but I don’t support them being banned. Next will be aftermarket triggers like Geissele, Elftmann, and Timney with lighter trigger pulls and shorter resets. Give the Dems an inch and they’ll try to take a mile.
4173 2018-02-21 10:11:28 @Emma4Change  You all are making a difference, yes, change is happening already. Trump calling for a ban on bump stocks (Las Vegas) and improved background checks. You have tremendous support and my deepest sympathy. God Bless You
4174 2018-02-21 10:10:39 Banning bump stocks isn't enough now. We need REAL #GunReformNow
4175 2018-02-21 10:09:41 Automatic weapons aren't illegal. Please stop saying that, they are not. There is an entire community of people who own automatic weaponry in America. 
If you think the line is only 'not automatic' then shit like bump stocks, are those ok?
4176 2018-02-21 10:09:36 "Bump stocks" are at best a novelty item, and at worse an accuracy eliminating gimmick, but @POTUS please Sir! Don't let the anti-2nd Nazis put some broad, generalized crap on your desk. They will use it to eliminate the right to bare arms all together!
4177 2018-02-21 10:09:19 Oh that’s right those weapons are already banned. Bumps stocks were determined by obama to not be illegal
4178 2018-02-21 10:09:12 I'm still annoyed by the fact boltguns made for human users don't have stocks. I can understand SMs not needing 'em, but humans would. #warhammer40k

4183 2018-02-21 10:07:19 @realDonaldTrump; may you have a good day President Trump. Bump stocks are an accessory to a rifle like a scope. Making tighter regs on the gun is not the answer, securing our schools with trained armed personnel would be a smarter step. May God help and guide you with this.

4200 2018-02-21 10:01:44 Dude. Do not.
4201 2018-02-21 10:01:21 Mr Trump. Banning bump stocks are a bare start. You need to introduce licensing for all guns, registration of them ALL, and ban semi auto weapons. Handguns should require real reasons to own them. Look at gun laws in Australia.

4208 2018-02-21 09:58:37 Delays will be variable and unpredictable. Just moving the schedule to the right won't work. No CU will mean returning to stocks, warehouses, rents, more staff, wastage through obsolescence, unhappy FD and investors. And loss of customers who want JIT delivery, not back orders.
4209 2018-02-21 09:57:33 How is a women-only writers' convention going to effect an industry?   Wealthy women are everywhere.  Why do they not patronise female literature?  The time for 'patriarchy' arguments has long since passed I'm afraid.
4210 2018-02-21 09:57:01 @msnbc @cnn What I don't understand, is, why hasn't our social media fight fire with fire & taken on the Russian bots with their same type of cyber ammo: craft a counter narrative of prepotorous meme's. Example & since Trump hinted at taking away bump stocks: #TrumpTakesAwayGuns
4211 2018-02-21 09:57:00 Bans don’t accomplish anything, and bump stocks don’t make a gun more deadly. It’s bad logic.
4212 2018-02-21 09:56:08 NRA had already conceded bump stocks and Trump removed the additional background checks last year..but he’ll get credit for doing absolutely fuck all 
4213 2018-02-21 09:54:49 we have larger scams of stock market than diamond industry. Investors are trapped in stocks with high price, operator play games & shares become penny shares. Investors disappear. shell companies listed. should we ban share market too? No. you cannot paint all with one color.
4214 2018-02-21 09:53:40 I did research on topic, bump stocks least sold items in a gun shop & purchased mainly by those whom committed mass shootings, like Vegas. This is token gesture, but b'ground checks & training needs 2 be mandatory. No way u drive a car w-out passing written & driving test.
4215 2018-02-21 09:53:04 He was good in his former invesco life, it’s the sins of this life that are catching up: stuffing his income fund with cash guzzling biotech & having to chase yield with highly geared stocks to try to make up the income

4217 2018-02-21 09:52:26 But that's not just-in-time. That's keeping stocks. Ask finance directors how they feel about that.
4218 2018-02-21 09:52:20 While investors seem to have adjusted to 10-year rates at a four-year high for now, the deluge of supply could push yields higher, weakening the case for owning stocks at elevated valuations

4231 2018-02-21 09:46:40 Counter-arguments like the claims they are paid actors or brainless pawns - those sorts of "arguments". The GOP is so fearful of the NRA they won't even pass legislation to ban frigging bump stocks. A lot of gun owners are fed up with this nonsense.

4236 2018-02-21 09:43:06 That doesn't disprove my point. That confirms that the Bush Administration approved of bump stocks, it's just the change between those two versions that didn't fly.

So I ask again, why are you only blaming Obama? And why did Trump and the NRA take so long after Vegas to say so?

4239 2018-02-21 09:40:58 You just earned my vote. There are a bunch of MUST ideas: ban bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity magazines, mandatory wait time, mandatory ‘psychiatric‘ evaluation,  background checks, no domestic violence or any violence, any mental illness that might suggest violence.

4243 2018-02-21 09:37:15 If bump stocks are illegal, why isn't Trump already removing them?  If bump stocks are not illegal, wouldn't making them illegal require legislation? Is this Trump's latest attempt to consolidate power in his hands?

4254 2018-02-21 09:31:38 There could be different variables to try out, definitely. As long as the 2a is protected. I think it's a good start to take away bump stocks (that's what they're called right?) 
I just know there's evil in the world, and some people are gonna do whatever to commit evil acts..

4257 2018-02-21 09:30:58 While it's common sense to outlaw bump stocks, they were not used in the last massacre. Semi automatics should be outlawed period.

4261 2018-02-21 09:28:59 I'd definitely support a clear, structured legislative measure on bump-stocks. Like shall issue reciprocal CCW with a bump stock ban. I'd also like to see the NFA rewritten as well as its successor policies- I think it's time to make new civilian automatics legal under NFA again.
4262 2018-02-21 09:28:55 President Trump I personally don't care about bump stocks but guns aren't the problem people are. No gun ever killed anyone they are tools like a hammer or knife in the right hands useful in the wrong dangerous. But it is still the hands holding it that determine that.

4266 2018-02-21 09:27:25 Trump "banning" Bump stocks is a start. But it also means he's about 9 mass shootings behind the rest of us.
4267 2018-02-21 09:25:29 Trump’s call for banning “bump stocks” and the @NRA’s complicity prove how compromised both the organization and the White House are. Their Russian handlers further driving a wedge between American people. What did bump stocks have to do with the shooting in Florida?

4273 2018-02-21 09:19:36 So Trump wants to ban "bump stocks", even though they've not been used in most mass shootings.

It's almost as if he's had a meeting with the NRA to work out what's the least they can get away with, but still be able to claim they're "doing something"... 
4274 2018-02-21 09:19:15 No, that's because the President at the time supported gun control legislation. Trump's campaign was supported by $30 million from @NRA and a complicit @GOP who last year blocked legislation against Bump Stocks that Trump now says he supports. More guns = more dead #GunContolNow

The conversation should have taken 10 seconds.

"Is there a practical use for bump stocks?"
No.
"Then why do citizens have them?"
4278 2018-02-21 09:16:16 Really disappointed with our RINO president.  Banning bump stocks, big government spending, amnesty, tariffs.  Might as well have HRC in the White House!

4285 2018-02-21 09:14:01 Thank you for taking a first step by banning bump stocks! Now we need to ban semi-automatic guns, like the AR-15, from civilian use. FYI, There have been ZERO mass school shootings in the U.K. Since 1996 when handguns were banned.

4330 2018-02-21 08:49:22 Why do you see this as an attack on the 2nd amendment? Why restricting bump stocks specifically?
4331 2018-02-21 08:49:00 3) I would also love to see a law preventing the use of bump stocks which make legal guns much more dangerous. They allow a gun to fire at nearly the rate of a machine gun.
4332 2018-02-21 08:48:43 @realDonaldTrump Thank you, President Trump, for the ban on bump stocks; a bold and brave first step! (See? I *can* be nice when YOU do the right thing!) Now, please outlaw automatic weapons, too. It will feel EXTRA good!
4333 2018-02-21 08:47:30 If you read the memo carefully and have been following the ATF review of bump stocks, it's easy to see the memo doesn't say what the media is reporting it says. @MrColionNoir has summed up what the memo says.

4335 2018-02-21 08:47:04 Yet Obama & democrats did Nothing. Even with a majority in Congress. Trump is bringing people to the table, proposing legislation to block bump stocks, and recommending tighter restrictions. Don't let your hate get in the way of your sense of knowledge.

4337 2018-02-21 08:45:32 Trump is trolling the media. The memo doesn't actually say what the media is reporting it says. It's a huge nothingburger that includes a fairly blatant wink and nod to gun owners. The mainstream media now owns the claim that Trump wants to ban bump stocks. It's a genius move.

4356 2018-02-21 08:38:13 To make money in stocks you must have, "the vision to see them, the courage to buy them and the patience to hold them". Patience is the rarest of the three.

4360 2018-02-21 08:37:40 @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 Trump's under pressure  move on 'bump stocks' carries a double-barrelled risk. It will infuriate much of his pro-gun NRA hardcore while doing little to deter pro-gun control protest momentum launched by young Americans who'll see it as desperate opportunism

4381 2018-02-21 08:24:54 To be clear, it is not a gun control measure, it is a memo calling for an administrative action on bump stocks that would not be legal.

4392 2018-02-21 08:17:00 Cause bump stocks don't meet the definition of automatic, like binary triggers and gat cranks each still require a pull of the trigger for each and every shot. Unlike a filed seer, drop in auto seer or burst fire kit which allow multiple shots from one pull of the trigger.

4427 2018-02-21 08:05:50 Bump stocks were supposed to be banned after the Vegas attack, Trump didn't do it, now all of a sudden he is doing it because the school kids are on him. The NRA gave Trump permission to ban these but not assault rifles.
4428 2018-02-21 08:05:50 Not only that but the only "common sense gun law" is total ban on guns. I heard some shit about banning "bump stocks", that's not the thing killing kids in schools! It's like trying to stop stabbings by banning knives that cost more than $70, you're missing the point somewhat....

4430 2018-02-21 08:05:40 You have to feel sorry for America's budding mass murderers. They may no longer be able to obtain bump stocks. 

Instead, these poor lost souls may have to save up for an extra couple of weeks, to buy an actual machine gun.

You have only acted now because Florida kids who escaped death have gone to Washington. What about assault rifles that these kids want banned. Background checks are a smokescreen for inaction

4483 2018-02-21 07:47:08 Pretty upset President Trump is pushing to ban bump stocks. Infringement.
4484 2018-02-21 07:46:42 I consider any semi automatic cartridge fed rifle an assault rifle. Our FN FAL’s were semi auto. How about all the conversions made on semi automatic rifles? The bump stocks for example. YouTube is filled with people blasting away with their modified M4’s.
4485 2018-02-21 07:46:29 300m+ guns in USA. I am sure banning bump stocks will help! What a joke. The total lack of morality and political metal from #realDonaldTrump down - Sad!
4486 2018-02-21 07:45:26 Il s'agit peut être simplement d'une erreur ou d'un bug technique. Il suffit de leur poser la question mais normalement si il n'y avait pas de stocks, il n'aurait pas été possible de commander ;)

4494 2018-02-21 07:41:24 I realize that 
But what do you think bump stocks do 
They turn the guns into automatic 

And this is legal 
And they have been used in multiple.mass shootings

4497 2018-02-21 07:40:44 The NRA did when they said “we should ban bump stocks”

It’s a shitty spot to be in
4498 2018-02-21 07:40:20 This may be a bit of a wild theory but with the Tangerine Tyrant saying he’s gonna ban bump stocks & toughen background checks I’m thinking he knows the GOP/ NRA are fucked & being the selfish twat he is he may well flip/ flop across to Dems (as he was originally) or go it Indy.
4499 2018-02-21 07:40:04 Mo, it's doesn't take an elite education to realize bump stocks are an accessory. We'll make them illegal. Subpoena the sales receipts from the websites that sold them, then come take them and any semi auto they're near too.
4500 2018-02-21 07:39:58 >Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks'
Ох, ну наконец-то что-то адекватное. Трампу как раз не грозит критика поехавших, которые считают что любое регулирование оружия это сразу коммунизм.
4501 2018-02-21 07:39:40 Wir erinnern uns: Bump stocks wurden unter der Obama-Administration für legal erklärt. 

Wir erinnern uns nicht: Jeglicher Aufschrei darüber.
4502 2018-02-21 07:38:34 Who NEEDS a gun and can't wait 2 days
Should know in advance 
Can't exactly go buy a gun to defend yourself in the moment either

If they're normal people they won't fail the background checks

Please research bump.stocks I don't see how anyone can defend them
4503 2018-02-21 07:38:33 1.4 million people have been killed in the US by firearms between 1968 & 2011. Japan rarely has 10 gun deaths per year, or 400 compared to 1.4 million in the same time frame. Banning bump stocks wont save 1.3 million #NRABloodMoney #theresistance #hardball #amjoy #GOPComplicit
4504 2018-02-21 07:37:58 Does anybody actually take a look at Nikkei’s history here? They predict this nearly every time, generally incorrectly. $aapl is one of the market’s favorite stocks to manipulate.
4505 2018-02-21 07:37:49 I support the second amendment fully, but I stand by the decision to ban “bump stocks”. I don’t think we should have something like that get into the wrong hands ever again. #SecondAmendment
4506 2018-02-21 07:35:40 Trump signed a memo for the ATF to ban the bump stock but they don't have the authority to do so.  So... nothing happpens. Congress needs to provide legislation to ban the bump stocks.
4507 2018-02-21 07:35:28 Surely Trump banning bump stocks will just push up demand for ARs ? Winners ? The gun shops and retailers who will sell MORE guns #OnlyInAmerica
4508 2018-02-21 07:34:55 When the old stupendous Midcap rally will happen, everyone would have been striving for that for couple of months now but it's not happening, just very few stocks performing, all other just pausing or going down everyday
4509 2018-02-21 07:34:16 Trump just did something I agree with...hell hath frozen overeth. Thank you for moving to ban bump stocks. One small step towards common sense gun reform, one giant leap for @realDonaldTrump.

If you can't drink alcohol you can't buy assukt rifles
The gun control I want is we need a stricter background check system, more FEDERAL training requirements to own a gun, a federal waiting period, and bump stocks illegal
4517 2018-02-21 07:30:59 Only opposed to the following:
1. Any weapon that can be fitted with a high capacity mag.
2. High capacity mags.
3. Bump stocks or any devices sold to alter any weapon to make it fully automatic.
4. Unrestricted high volume ammo sales.  Not sure where to draw the line here.

4519 2018-02-21 07:29:33 Expert soldiers will tell you that bump stocks decrease accuracy and result in less damage. No law will stop a motivated killer. People are making bombs with household products that can kill a whole room full of people. Hire armed unemployed vets to patrol schools and have drills

4521 2018-02-21 07:28:15 Trump pushes for ban on rapid-fire gun ''bump stocks''...
4522 2018-02-21 07:27:58 @realDonaldTrump if you out law bump stocks whats to stop a guy who has ill will and wants to kill many people from using a 3d printer and building it himself? only thing that stops the mad man is a guy with a gun or he runs out of ammo you are smart man don't let dems push bs
4523 2018-02-21 07:27:57 A ban on bump stocks is meaningless. An AR-15 will fire a round as fast as one can pull the trigger. When I was trained in military we were told to keep the weapon in semi-auto mode because full auto was wasteful and would require much reloading. Semi-auto was more accurate.
4524 2018-02-21 07:27:14 Trump bans bump stocks months after this immediate no brainier should have been enacted but does zero to halt the murderous slaughter in USA schools by dodging the bullet of real gun control. What a misnomer President @realDonaldTrump. #DodgyDonald strikes again.
4525 2018-02-21 07:26:57 Huh. So Trump is actually trying to ban bump stocks. Not shocked given its DT Jr that is the gun advocate of that family.
4526 2018-02-21 07:26:49 Speaking of bump stocks, maybe we can get some more transparency regarding the Vegas shooting. 

In contrast with Parkland, where vast amounts of info was unveiled within hours, Vegas is still littered with unanswered questions.
4527 2018-02-21 07:25:24 People shocked about Wallmart stocks going down "out of amazon fear". LOL. I don't even know what Wallmart is.
4528 2018-02-21 07:24:33 Bump stocks were only used at one mass shooting. One bill for one item. Not enough.

4531 2018-02-21 07:22:51 The weapons  that bump stocks are being placed on are already weapons designed to fire rapidly.. Assault rifles  can easily fire off  2 magazines, 60 rounds in a minute without the bump stocks. Each one of these rounds could easily tear your insides into pieces.
4532 2018-02-21 07:22:28 Is that not the most pathetic attempt at gun control by #morontrump banning bump stocks.  Ban guns you pathetic twat

4536 2018-02-21 07:20:31 That was a great video! As for the issue at hand... Trump should realize, that it's not bump stocks that is the problem here.

4544 2018-02-21 07:17:42 Trump wants a ban on bump stocks. A step in the right direction. Unfortunately he already took one in the wrong direction by overturning an Obama ban, just because Obama did it, and Florida just voted against an assault rifle ban.
Just a step but with miles to go.
4545 2018-02-21 07:16:46 @realDonaldTrump going to outlaw bump-stocks eh?  Why don't we just out law any thing that is more than a single shot, eh?  If the FBI can't stop one teen how are they going to stop bump-stocks?

4546 2018-02-21 07:16:36 DT's ban on bumpstocks is like trying to put out a 5 alarm fire with a squirt gun. THE problem is clear. It's public ownership of war fighting assault weapons, not the bump stocks, the ownership and sales. He solves nothing. He doesn't even identify the problem itself.

4549 2018-02-21 07:15:54 They are not coming after "US" Kemosabe.

Reform of data bank for background checks. Bump stocks are illegal once placed on a weapon so Outlaw the sale of them   ETC...

I want the value to be driven by users who see crypto not as an asset to be liquidated into fiat currency and instead as the liquid, digital currency.
4564 2018-02-21 07:10:25 Good news that Trumpski seems to be shifting his position. Here is the thing. If the rationale for banning bump stocks is denying access to rapid fire weapons, the same logic should apply to al rapid fire weapons i.e. assault weapons.  How far are you prepared to go Trumpski?
4565 2018-02-21 07:09:57 So since there's alot of talk about banning  bump stocks and assault rifles, what are you supposed to do with them if they get banned? People put alot of time and money into their firearms.
4566 2018-02-21 07:09:37 Also shorting stocks should be outlawed - it’s a ridiculous practice and it’s long been suspected that many connected Wall Street brokers game the system with insider knowledge. Allowing the shorting of stocks opens the door to far more unethical behaviour in brokerage world...

4578 2018-02-21 07:04:39 @realDonaldTrump gun owners helped you get to the WH, and this decision on "bump stocks" is a stab in the back. You might as well out law pressure cookers, cars, alcohol again, pills, forks, spoons, crazy democrats,  rental trucks, FBI, should I keep going?
4579 2018-02-21 07:04:36 Fuck bump stocks. Eliminate assault weapons period. Nothing in the second amendment denies this move.

4582 2018-02-21 07:03:46 A stock AR15 is not equipped with "bump stocks" and neither was the one used in Florida & the law, Trump signed, still makes it easier for mentally disturbed persons like Cruz to buy a gun tomorrow. It's all about money. Me, YOU & our kids are expendable

4587 2018-02-21 07:03:05 Trump thinks bump stocks are stocks on Wall Street that get a bump when something negative about him comes out @IanKarmel
4588 2018-02-21 07:02:50 i am with the right, but i do agree that bump stocks are pretty much useless in home defense, you could also just shoot at a very close fire-rate in semi-auto if you have a good trigger finger.
4589 2018-02-21 07:02:37 @realDonaldTrump is fond of signing executive orders. He's signed hundreds of them in his first year as President and a lot of them are just plain stupid.  
But 3 months after Las Vegas he's still waiting for a committee to report before banning bump stocks.
4590 2018-02-21 07:02:32 Automatvåpen er allerede forbudt på føderalt nivå. Las Vegas-massakren ble utført med en «bumper stock» - en innretning som gjør halvautomat til helautomat. Ikke engang dét klarte den republikanske kongressen å forby. Trumps forslag om forbud mot bumper stocks nå er en vits.

4598 2018-02-21 06:59:57 Banning bump stocks is a step forward, but the proof is still in the pudding! Still a mountain to climb!
4599 2018-02-21 06:59:23 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, with all due respect, banning bump stocks for the actions of one man is no different than banning airliners for 9/11 or motor vehicles for mass vehicular homocide. Nobody mentions holding the FBI & other LEOs accountable for dropping the ball. Why?
4600 2018-02-21 06:58:57 Pensions should stay at initial set age of 60 for women 65 for men that is when government officially class you as a pensioner bus pass clarifying point so why no help financially for an extra ten years when that’s when needed the most. No wonder people dying before their time.
4601 2018-02-21 06:58:05 Trump is banning bump stocks. CNN is showing up to random people’s doorsteps asking them questions about Russia , and high school kids
4602 2018-02-21 06:56:56 Gun owners are a safe & respectable lot. Some own full auto & thousands of others own bump stocks. There is no issue w/ guns, the issue is criminally unstable who will use any weapon. Brazil & Mexico are both valid & it seems Sweden is starting to have an issue w/ grenades...
4603 2018-02-21 06:56:23 No one saw Jordan going from penny stocks to making 60 million a month
4604 2018-02-21 06:56:12 Bump stocks. A half measure. And an insult.

4608 2018-02-21 06:53:24 so maybe bump stocks but really no way u and Donald will do that however let me explain to you what happened in vegas and florida so maybe your pea sized brains can pick up some of the facts @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr not that you will do anything about guns
4609 2018-02-21 06:53:18 I agree. But background checks are a start.
Trump pushing for a Ban on gun bump stocks is a good step forward.
It may not be enough, but we won’t know until we try. And I’ll take some progress over none whatsoever any day of the week.
I will give trump credit for this.
4610 2018-02-21 06:52:56 I'm very pro 2nd. I am 100% for improvement of current laws. Funding for streamline BGC to include all states and Fed is a great thing. Bump stocks are stupid but not worth the cost to regulate as it's a 0 crime impact law, only a political move.
4611 2018-02-21 06:52:16 My Nikkei really sluggish, Hang Seng H-Fin (+2%) on fire. Asia Pacific stocks rise with a stronger USD and despite risk struggling for most of the US session. Walmart (-10%) drags Dow lower ( -254 pts ) while US Treasury sold $179bn of securities. Orderly overall
4612 2018-02-21 06:52:06 I won $3,000 right here in the US on Predict it-org Obama legalized political betting for a Liberal University to be able to make money, it's NOT gambling it's penny stocks, each stock is worth a dollar, but what you pay for it depends on the market...

4624 2018-02-21 06:49:34 okay so when I stock tank in doubles im a god but when my stocks tank in real life suddenly im "homeless" and "need financial help"
4625 2018-02-21 06:48:16 The Vegas guns were NOT full auto - if the reports are true, we really don't know more than they've said so far. Bump stocks are even questionable because they just aren't very accurate because of the mechanism. Gun control doesn't work, just ask Mexico & Brazil
4626 2018-02-21 06:48:08 Sorry Kurt. Gotta go against you on this one. 
A ban on bump-stocks is a shiney flashy thing to distract you from the fact that they haven’t actually done anything about the problem. 
The GUN is the issue. No gun - bump-stock is useless.
4627 2018-02-21 06:48:00  We want machine guns and bump stocks

4632 2018-02-21 06:45:44 Yep. I started trading stocks seriously in the last 6 months before the GFC, thought I was a genius. Then REKT!
4633 2018-02-21 06:45:21 Trump talking to his WH Chief of Staff...
Trump: I sense people are against this practice of bumping stocks of companies selling firearms. Let’s ban this ‘bump stock’ thing to appease the masses since sales of firearms are through the roof anyways.
Kelly: (long sigh)...
4634 2018-02-21 06:44:24 Allowing bump stocks to be sold is the correct choice. They aren't breaking any law and their effects can be replicated without the use of any device. What you just said is a great argument why to not vote Trump - he is more of a gun grabber than Obama
4635 2018-02-21 06:44:21 Stock tweeters have suddenly gone silent.

4638 2018-02-21 06:43:07 Bump stocks are so 5 months ago. The new trend is seeing if you can purchase an assault rifle being mentally ill
4639 2018-02-21 06:42:55 Watching all the trump supporters turn their back on him after hearing that he is in support of banning bump stocks for semi-automatic weapons is literally hilarious. Shows where their loyalties are at. Jumping ship when he tries to come together as a country for the better.
4640 2018-02-21 06:42:48 My rep @MichelleUgenti are you really in favor of bump stocks?  Since they ruin aim, their only value is in the spraying of bullets across a crowd of people.  I’m very disappointed that you voted to block discussion of HB2023.
4641 2018-02-21 06:42:47 It all fell apart when the Confederate side tried to fix bumb stocks to their muskets
4642 2018-02-21 06:42:24 Bump stocks are garbage. I got one as a promotion and its in a box in my attic.  Total junk.
4643 2018-02-21 06:42:08 Trump's not moving toward AWB, he's throwing another Obama era regulation out the window. Obama allowed the bump stocks to be sold. He could have stopped them, but he didn't, so Trump's just correcting his mistake. He's had to do a lot of that, right?
4644 2018-02-21 06:41:33 @realDonaldTrump’s order to ban bump stocks is a bit like putting an Elastoplast over the stump of a severed limb. 

Surely the real answer is to ban all weapons like we and most civilised countries do. 

Then again, we’re not bankrolled by the @NRA (or equivalent).

4651 2018-02-21 06:38:15 .@realDonaldTrump it’s NEVER been about bump stocks, its a generalization of “rate increasing devices” which effects ALL semi-auto firearms. Keep it up & your 1st term will be YUGE flop. More-so than Trump University. #MAGA doesn’t mean blind loyalty to YOU. #ShallNotBeInfringed
4652 2018-02-21 06:38:08 Bump stocks are incredibly cheap and easy to access, they were originally designed to assist with hunting for semi-disabled hunters, but in reality, there is no practical reason to ever own one. I agree it's not *much* but if he actually does this? Good. And I hate him so...
4653 2018-02-21 06:37:27 @realDonaldTrump 
If he's thinking bump stocks....that's not the end to being able to turn a semi-auto into an auto, there are plenty of other ways....  Perhaps, if we focused on the shooter and the process of how he obtained a weapon.......
4654 2018-02-21 06:37:22 This is a cynical ploy to save the AR-15.  We need to demand a ban of AR-15 sales, bump stocks and high cap magazines. Also, universal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases. Don't let up in 2 weeks.  We have to sustain pressure for change.

4656 2018-02-21 06:36:41 Trump does not have the authority to ban bump-stocks.  The dept of justice made that announcement last year.  It has to be congress and he knows it.  And congress will never do it when the sob's are owned by the NRA.

4659 2018-02-21 06:36:06 Mr. President, do not press for more gun control, bump stocks is not the issue. Have the laws enforced. You will see a decrease in gun use.  Put felons that use a gun back in jail as the law dictates. Take the “power” from judges that “reduce” the law.
4660 2018-02-21 06:36:05 I’ll believe it when I see it. Plus banning bump stocks is hardly gun control.
4661 2018-02-21 06:35:38 If he bans bump stocks, he will be seen as pulling a Reagan. Not great when the gun issue is much more important now than back then. Clinton lost congressional majorities over the AWB.
4662 2018-02-21 06:35:37 And banning bump stocks should not, could not, and will not stop us from advocating for common sense gun control and enforcement. Too many have died and the answer may not be black and white... but we need to do something.
4663 2018-02-21 06:35:25 How many bump stocks were actually sold? And do you know that you can bump fire with ANY kind of stock? Also, "high capacity" is a misnomer. The AR-15 comes standard with 30 rnd magazine. Not "high capacity." More than 30 rnd mag and jams like crazy.
4664 2018-02-21 06:34:24 If you are still wandering what country where Trumps loyalty is now your not alone. Just because he us POTUS right now he is not protecting us at all Bump stocks not a big deal a start. Protecting us from Russia is a huge deal and he is doing zip. Sanctions nope not happening
4665 2018-02-21 06:34:13 Jack and the Republicans need to stop insulting these young people and  other people intelligence this stuff they talk about is ridiculous bump stocks it's crazy need to get rid of this type guns PERIOD !!!!!
4666 2018-02-21 06:33:52 President Trump apparently going to sign EO to ban bump stocks in response to the Florida shooting. While we at YDCC are happy this measure is being taken, it must be realized to be a political ploy. Bump stocks were denounced by even the NRA. For Trump, it was a safe move.

4671 2018-02-21 06:32:10 US President Donald Trump has signed a memo to ban certain devices like the one used by the shooter in last year's Las Vegas killings. Bump-stocks make it possible for rifles to fire hundreds of shots a minute.
4672 2018-02-21 06:32:10 @realDonaldTrump So, you do realize what poor taste that thumbs up photo exhibits, right? These young people are not going to be appeased by bump stocks or background checks. The assault rifle is going down...just like your "bot" likes, Don. #ByeBye #enoughisenough
4673 2018-02-21 06:31:54 Again Trump is full of sh*t.   If I remember, banning bump stocks was something that puppetmaster NRA did not object to.   So Trump is “Allowed to” do that.   He is no hero.           NRA can GTFO of here.
4674 2018-02-21 06:31:01 I'm with you in regards to fully automatic weapons, and support the ban on bump stocks as Trump ordered today. No one needs to be able to modify they're semi-automatic to a fully automatic weapon. 
4675 2018-02-21 06:30:58 This may be the repeat of 2015, probably it will end up more volatile in the second half around elections time. I don’t think the yields have a lot higher to go, but certainly one more test of new highs, both in yields and stocks, should happen into spring. $SPX $TNX

4680 2018-02-21 06:26:27 Ban all assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Require BG checks for all purchases. Eliminate all BG check loopholes. Require safety training and safe storage. Bar DV perpetrators and the mentally ill from purchases.
4681 2018-02-21 06:26:17 I haven't studied whole lot into guns, laws, and all of that. Obama WH should've had someone monitor, approve, or disapprove all gun innovations. Bump stocks shouldn't have gone into full production. ATF approved it and most politicians didn't know about it til Vegas shooter.
4682 2018-02-21 06:25:31 No, we must focus on banning assault rifles. You just signed a FAKE memo banning bump stocks knowing they can ONLY be banned thru the legislative process (Congress). NOT thru the ATF (no authority to do this). All this is for show, not action. So Support Sen. Feinstein's ban bill

4685 2018-02-21 06:25:16 The justice department said Trump didn't have the authority to ban bump-stocks anyways.  Unless Congress outlaws the bump-stock it's just rhetoric to appease the public and Trump knows it.

4707 2018-02-21 06:14:32 He's full of shit. The NRA had to give approval and it will require votes. It's just so the GOP can say they did something before elections. Bump Stocks aren't anything without the gun & in mass murder the AR15 is weapon of choice.

4709 2018-02-21 06:13:25 He said "Ban devices that can convert Semi Automatic Weapons into Machine Guns" He never said "Bump Stocks", specifically.  Bump Stocks make Semi Auto fire faster but, not fully automatic. They do not turn an AR15 into a Machine Gun. He is playing word games.
4710 2018-02-21 06:13:22 Wow unbelievable Twitter is going to lose alot of people, & the people will find another available chats rooms instead of Twitter then their Stocks will go down, My ADVICE IS PULL YOUR STOCKS OUT OF TWITTER!!
4711 2018-02-21 06:12:35 Trump is mentioning bump stocks&background checks because he knows these brave students from Parkland are not dropping this fight. They're becoming activists who will not stop until they achieve their goals. Trump knows how bad this is for him, they'll be voters in next election
4712 2018-02-21 06:12:03 SIP in stocks or in pharma MF.??
4713 2018-02-21 06:12:01 Wait, wait .@PressSec Sanders please advise dotard don that the NRA controlled GOP Senate & Congress has already established that bump stocks don’t kill people. People kill people. The Thoughts & Prayers comment was needed here. You messed up.

4715 2018-02-21 06:11:45 Trump by banning bump stocks has done more than Obama did when dems were in control of the government. Well now isn't that intersecting?

4717 2018-02-21 06:11:14 The @NRA supports the changes with the bump stocks and more background checks. How are they “murderers”? You mean like Planned Parenthood? Who spends 100 times more on bought politicians?
4718 2018-02-21 06:11:11 Also funny that it took the so called president 5 months to act on bump stocks.
4719 2018-02-21 06:10:46 restrict the sale of penis-stocks to the mentally ill.
4720 2018-02-21 06:10:46 Now reject our NRA keepers and get moving. Ban bump stocks. Ban assault rifles. Implement waiting periods and background checks. You know, regulate weapons of mass destruction like you do the constitutional right to abortion.
4721 2018-02-21 06:09:59 Is this just for show? Can bump stocks be regulated? Legislation may be required to do anything about these & Legislation won't happen. Someone probably told him this so he can put his memo out and get "credit" for trying to do something gun related for the kids in Florida....
4722 2018-02-21 06:09:44 It’s so interesting what could pan out per SEC. Call it a stock, now it’s an anvil to take out Corp co’s, or does it get a heavy handed delivery in future and they all stockS? that wouldn’t be good. Or something in between. These unknowns make for our intense volatility.
4723 2018-02-21 06:09:12 Wow and you guys are VERY upset that someone is finally standing up to the NRA.

Instead of taking a pop quiz these kids had to walk over the bodies of their dead friends.

This needs to stop.

Ban bump stocks.  

Restore the assault rifle ban.

No one needs automatic weapons.
4724 2018-02-21 06:08:42 Been telling niggas to cop bump stocks now it's too late dumbass niggas.
4725 2018-02-21 06:08:41 Bump stocks are only one problem, gun control means closing all gun stores, mandating people to purchase guns from law enforcement or homeland security. No one needs 5 or 10 guns, no one needs semi automatic weapons.
4726 2018-02-21 06:07:17 When you remove your hat, you do not disappear entirely, silly. Bump stocks are an ACCESSORY.
4727 2018-02-21 06:07:11 Pat Robertson, calling for a possible ban on assault weapons as well as bump stocks - “It's just got to be sensible.” 
This might be only time Pat Robertson & "sensible" have appeared in the same sentence.
4728 2018-02-21 06:06:40 I love the fact that you are our president and all but the butt stocks are taking to fair. some of us need then to go hunting with so we don't fall our of the tree stand @realDonaldTrump
4729 2018-02-21 06:06:33 Whoa! Trump hasn't banned bump stocks yet. He asked Justice to draw up a proposal. Not a done deal, and since it's Trump, that makes all the difference!
4730 2018-02-21 06:05:57 ATF announced in December that it would explore the possibility of regulating bump stocks as machine guns, and asked the public to submit comments on the proposal. In the end, 85 percent of the more than 32,000 comments expressed opposition to such regulation,
4731 2018-02-21 06:05:31 @JoeNBC What a leader we have, wandering the halls over the weekend at his FL resort asking guests what he should do about gun control & whether he should fire Gen Kelly. Gonna throw out some crumbs about "bump stocks". U kidding me? How lame & weak. Plus moron Don Jr re-tweeting
4732 2018-02-21 06:05:19 I dont think banning an AR15 is proactive, or bump stocks, or grips. Nothing but stupid. I think we should hire Vets to stand gaurd over our schools, all entrances, armed. More than one, at each and every school. I also believe we should take a look at why

4740 2018-02-21 06:01:39 Tell that to the 58 people who died in Vegas.   

And before you quibble. Yes I know those were bump stocks.  But the distinction makes little difference to the dead.  

And also when you can fire 50 rounds a minute uninterrupted for several minutes, semi automatic hardly matters
4741 2018-02-21 06:00:55 Trump banning bump-stocks is a meaningless diversion.

Only ONE mass shooting in US history used a bump-stock.
We need Federal registration of all military-style assault rifles.

4748 2018-02-21 05:59:25 Happy to read @realDonaldTrump is slowly making major changes: ban on bump stocks and strengthening background checks. In light of what happened in Florida, you should not promote gun use. Kids do NOT need to think about guns; they have more important things to focus on.
4749 2018-02-21 05:59:05 I think trump's call for a ban on bump stocks was spoon fed to him by the NRA, who are now trying to stop a burgeoning movement by throwing a crumb to the majority of Americans who want common sense gun control. trump took 30MM fr NRA.
4750 2018-02-21 05:58:29 I gotta be patience with stocks 
4751 2018-02-21 05:58:27 Maybe he's one of "the people" with ISP stocks.
4752 2018-02-21 05:58:25 Yes, arms includes all weapons. Bump stocks are a novelty no one takes seriously. Bump firing is a method that cannot be banned, Newton's law.
4753 2018-02-21 05:58:21 Obama did nothing but pay lip service. He cares about no one except himself.  He blamed gun owners and the NRA EVERY time.  And Trump did compromise, today. He banned bump stocks and instituted a minimum age requirement. That's more than what Obaml ever did.
4754 2018-02-21 05:58:02 Obama just enjoyed the position and perks. He is a lot richer today. Ask Neil Bush about how Obama got some special money and stocks from Bush Family for not Persecuting Georgie. Before he was Sworn in.
4755 2018-02-21 05:57:58 It is. The bumpfire stocks retain the one round fired per trigger pull. It's not a conversion to a mg
4756 2018-02-21 05:57:51 so i dont kno much about stocks but im curious as too why dow j has 5x the amount of the next highest and what would happen if it were to fold?
4757 2018-02-21 05:57:48 Exactly my thoughts. Very troublesome. Rate increasing modifications could cover a wide variety of parts; binary triggers, rotary triggers, bump stocks, and even low travel triggers if left up to the state to decide what increase rate of fire. It also sets the precedence (...)

Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American..." Tench Coxe
4763 2018-02-21 05:54:23 And Trump came out in favor of taking action on... bump stocks. Which can be done through regulations that don't have to pass Congress. The cowardice continues.
4764 2018-02-21 05:54:06 People tend to expect multi-bagger returns from their stocks.

And sometimes, in reality, the stocks don't move an inch for years.

4766 2018-02-21 05:53:35 Yes I believe I knew from the beginning what you are saying. I too am concerned about any change in gun laws. The left performs surgery with an axe.
I was not aware of bump stocks until LV; no claim to be a gun enthusiast, but strong on 2nd Amendment rights. No big differences.
4767 2018-02-21 05:52:58 Another problem is since guns are mechanical objects, they can be retooled. Mags w/ 10 round capacity can be manipulated to hold more, if you ban bump stocks someone can just make one at home. 3D printers are getting advanced enough to make attachments at home.

4768 2018-02-21 05:52:57 I have faith they will put it in a committee to be looked at, why you ask?

4770 2018-02-21 05:52:27 You have to fight back with facts guys. If you haven't yet, look back at the history of these mass shooters. Since 1988, more than 3 dozen of these shooters were on psych meds and I'm an NRA supporter, but I believe the bump stocks should be outlawed also.
4771 2018-02-21 05:52:02 Well he is trying to make changes such as making bump stocks illegal. The dems will delay votes and obstruct on it for the sole reason it was his idea. They will do nothing till election time. Blame the swamp who has been there for much longer than Trump.

4775 2018-02-21 05:50:17 Expressing they might be okay with banning bump stocks and more comprehensive background checks are attempts to act like they are doing something. Not meaningful. But it's good to know you support the FBI confiscating guns from people without criminal convictions or due process.
4776 2018-02-21 05:50:17 The left made a big deal out of the bump stock after Las Vegas, so it's an easy one, even NRA won't oppose. & he's doing it as a EO, Congress won't vote. Incidentally, Obama's BATF ruled bump stocks legal because they don't really do what the anti-gun crowd claims
4777 2018-02-21 05:50:16 I think he's looking to ban bump stocks through regulations, not legislation.

It looks like Trump is trying to refocus the #GunViolence debate away from the gun, to a discussion about what's causing the violence. It'll be interesting to see if he can pull it off.
4778 2018-02-21 05:50:04 Machine guns (by which I assume you mean fully automatic firearms) are banned. Bump stocks are a way around it; turning semi-automatic into nearly full automatic
4779 2018-02-21 05:49:54 whether it’s declaring opioid epidemic, infrastructure week (twice), bump stocks or background checks, its bullshit with no intent of follow thru.
4780 2018-02-21 05:49:37 Look to the NRA leadership's surrender on Bump Stocks after Vegas and you will see why this is happening. The President is right in line with NRA's position, he is being led down the garden path by the likes of Wayne, Chris Cocks, and Marion Hammer.
4781 2018-02-21 05:49:31 I realize Trump is pushing this because it's just a move to appease the left, but f**k that.  I don't even have an interest in bump stocks, but - No more bans.  No more limits.  No more infringements.  I'm done.

4783 2018-02-21 05:49:12 It's within the document that founded us how things can be done.  Complete gun freedom is as bad as no guns at all.  Proper regulation is tough when even our politicians don't understand assault rifles, bump stocks, magazines, and ammo differences.

4803 2018-02-21 05:45:28 Because if they DID mess up our gun rights in that process, bump stocks become irrelevant. People would start building real machine guns.

4818 2018-02-21 05:39:53 I think this proposal will make the Left mad. It makes Trump look reasonable and destroys part of their narrative. Bump stocks are not efficient and doesn't enhance accuracy. The hypocritic Left will be caught in criticizing this move. I love it.
4819 2018-02-21 05:39:29 @realDonaldTrump supporting regulations to ban bump stocks isn't going to remedy anything. We do not have a gun problem. Bump stocks and the like are not the problem. The problem is government agencies not doing their job!
4820 2018-02-21 05:39:22 I do not believe such fits in with the intention of the law. I continue to belief that bumps stocks are a liability to the gun rights cause.

4822 2018-02-21 05:39:08 The president is trying to place a ban on bump stocks and he has floating ideas, what kind of ideas, what does a president have to do to place a ban, simple as that...
4823 2018-02-21 05:39:06 The NRA really wins in this case.  Possible ban so get your bump stocks now.  Trump is not a man of his words.  Won't believe it until I see it and even then...still questionable.  We need change.  This isn't working.
4824 2018-02-21 05:38:45 Did the Florida shooter had bump stocks? White House is a laughing stock
4825 2018-02-21 05:38:45 How about standing up for the BC Sport Fishing industry that generates $1 Billion for BC every year and ask what is being done to protect BC’s wild salmon stocks? That’s infinitely more important than a switch of Family Day. - Sincerely guy in tourism biz
4826 2018-02-21 05:38:39 @finebaum @FinebaumsIman @darriel5 @Legendisland @cnnbrk  banning bump stocks is like using raid to rid all the roaches in the forest.
4827 2018-02-21 05:38:34 OMG, no one likes bump stocks.  Ask any NRA member.  But....ok we will outlaw them.  Do you feel better now?

4830 2018-02-21 05:38:19 What do bump stocks do?
4831 2018-02-21 05:38:14 Something that should have happened months ago, when bump stocks allowed a shooter to commit the deadliest shooting in the US.
4832 2018-02-21 05:38:01 Most stocks are not related to bank scam, that’s not a justification. ITC  HAS POOR GROWTH -cig sales.  You have better safe options.

4835 2018-02-21 05:37:16 I rarely buy stocks.
4836 2018-02-21 05:37:15 Ban BUMP STOCKS!! Yeah, knives, cars, bombs n poison all ok!! Only those who kill w/a gun are evil (sarc). Absolute idiots these Democrats.
4837 2018-02-21 05:37:14 Bump stocks don’t turn semi autos to full auto. Adding an accessory does not reclassify a weapon. Saying a bump stock turns a semi to full auto is like saying adding a wing to a civic makes it a race car.
4838 2018-02-21 05:36:45 David Brooks is a solid argument for bringing back the stocks and rotten tomatoes.

4842 2018-02-21 05:35:59 Tidigare nämnda faktorer + en mediakultur som glorifierar allehanda idioter bidrar allihop mer till att fenomenet ”masskjutning” fortsätter i USA. Bump stocks känns som helt fel ände att börja nysta i. Som vanligt fattar politiker ingenting om var fokus bör ligga.
4843 2018-02-21 05:35:22 As a Pro-gun advocate, I believe Bump stocks should be banned, since it enables the use of a highly dangerous technique that mimics automatic fire.
4844 2018-02-21 05:34:51 Because history teaches us that they never stop.  Give an inch and they will take a mile. I don't give a flip about bump stocks.  I care about their real goals.  Fight them here, to keep them away from the most important items.  Not another inch.

4848 2018-02-21 05:34:22 Is it true Trump has recommended bump stocks be banned? That would mean he's at least doing something. More than the others?
4849 2018-02-21 05:33:30 Trump tries to ban bump stocks for semi-automatic guns and all people can worry about is how that wouldn’t have prevented the Florida shooting. NEWSFLASH the only way the Florida shooting could have be prevented was if the FBI and school administrators did their jobs.
4850 2018-02-21 05:33:17 If they DO propose to fuck up our other gun laws, then we keep the bump stocks.

That’s a worthy trade.

They aren’t good for much of anything and haven’t been used in more than a couple of crimes in decades.
4851 2018-02-21 05:33:03 @realDonaldTrump Wow you got off your dead ass and are trying to get bump stocks banned. What a great idea! It wasn't yours though. Lots more gun control work must get done. #maketherepublicansdigthegraves
4852 2018-02-21 05:32:49 So far he's pushing for a ban on bump stocks. Great question
4853 2018-02-21 05:32:41 Parkland shooting and #Bumpstocks don't go together. No bumpfire stocks were used in the making of this horrible event.

4855 2018-02-21 05:32:07 Är någon förvånad över att ”bump stocks” är huvudfokus för Trump efter Parkland, Florida? Finns ju femtielva andra saker som kass psykvård, drogpolitik, noll förvaringskrav, ett slapphänt FBI och gun free zones, som alltihop bidragit till att dylika attentat är deras verklighet.
4856 2018-02-21 05:32:04 I will repeat this one last time: I don’t give a damn about bump stocks. Even though they’ve been perfectly legal since they were invented.

What I care about is that in the process of getting rid of bump stocks, they don’t fuck up our other gun laws.

That’s it.

4859 2018-02-21 05:31:00 Please explain how banning Bump stocks will calm the hoards of liberals @DLoesch ? What are your thoughts on the NRA supporting this unnecessary move. Rationalize this decision the NRA has made. It doesn't make sense.
4860 2018-02-21 05:30:52 I don't care about bump stocks. Throw the Dems a bone. If I need automatic I can do it in 15 min flat without a bump stock.

4863 2018-02-21 05:29:54 We were specifically talking about bump stocks, which should be banned and he did not try to ban it

4865 2018-02-21 05:29:17 Lol this is 100% what happened. "Bump? Stocks? That's good right?"
4866 2018-02-21 05:28:14 This @realDonaldTrump proposal on bump stocks is, indeed, nothing but a con job - don’t fall for it. They’ll drag this out until they think the controversy is past, then ditch it. Don’t take the bait!
4867 2018-02-21 05:28:10 Memo to MR.TRUMP...It’s not the bump stocks that are killing people, it’s the guns. And events like the grade school CHILDREN raising money by a raffle of which the GRAND PRIZE is an AR 15 ASSAULT rifle. The right to bear arms in AMERICA is far more than the preservative of life.
4868 2018-02-21 05:27:46 My take is different. I believe Trump is asking DOJ to do something that’s smart and makes sense regarding Bump stocks. We elected DJT because Dems want to disarm American and would have under Hillary. Dems don’t trust Joe citizen a whole lot. @foxandfriends @Varneyco @LouDobbs
4869 2018-02-21 05:27:16 @TrumpCommsHQ, Don’t give in to the emotion of the anti-gun movement. Banning bump stocks is a slippery slope with no real public safety gain.
4870 2018-02-21 05:26:23 An AR15 isn't an assault rifle. To stop attacks at schools folks need to spend more time and money protecting schools with metal detectors, locked doors and security. You can't legislate evil away. Banning bump stocks or AR15s won't stop future attacks.
4871 2018-02-21 05:26:18 Do you want him to put on a genie suit and turn back time?  He's doing something. He already banned the "bump stocks". Congress has to propose bills, then they get voted on in the Senate and House, then President Trump will sign.  Much more than ANY other President has done.

4874 2018-02-21 05:24:47 I agree, bump stocks don't mean anything. I don't care if they're banned. Banning guns, ammo or magazines is another matter. I have faith that President Trump will never allow it & he will veto any legislation that tries to do so.
4875 2018-02-21 05:24:38 Trump signed an executive order to regulate bump stocks? Who wants to be the one to tell him that's not what condoms are called.
4876 2018-02-21 05:24:00 You do understand that this is pointless, right? Bump stocks can't be banned by executive order. It needs to be done legislatively - through Congress. Translation: it ain't happening.
4877 2018-02-21 05:23:57 Great just reinstate The Obama initiative you reversed and add bump stocks and assault weapons. Put your name all over it. Whatever it takes to keep innocent people and kids from getting killed.
4878 2018-02-21 05:23:52 Most people agree bump stocks are a novelty accessory item that doesn't bother me if they go.. it's when they tried to add other items that get the no. Yes on 18.. if you can die 4 your country u can own a gun. ACLU disagree w your 1st question
4879 2018-02-21 05:23:38 Trump thinks he can snow the chumps.  But 45's lied every time.  So 'bump stocks & background checks' won't get it done.  An assault rifle ban is the lowest common denominator.  QED
4880 2018-02-21 05:23:24 Hey @Twitter how come I'm never involved in these purges of conservatives? I support 2A, oppose abortion, fully enamored with @POTUS (his leftward lurch on bump stocks not withstanding). What's a man got to do to be singled out and marginalized by you people? I need cred!

4888 2018-02-21 05:20:37 We shall see.  Do you believe that someone on a no fly list should be able to purchase a gun?  Do you believe some with mental issues should be able to purchase a gun?  Do you believe an 18 year old should be able to purchase a gun?
Do you believe bump stocks should be sold?
4889 2018-02-21 05:20:11 #NeverAgain Hey because of your pressure Trump got off his dead ass and is trying to get congress to ban 'bump stocks'! These are the attachments for assault rifles that convert them to full machine guns. Way to go! I'm helping as much as I can!

4892 2018-02-21 05:19:33 Wasn't bump stocks like five mad shootings ago?
4893 2018-02-21 05:19:25 Give back 30 mil your campaign took from NRA for 2016 campaign! Then require background checks, reduced firing or eliminate Semi automatic’s & get rid of bump stocks!
4894 2018-02-21 05:18:37 It all depends on your investment style. If I choose to follow a Value style, sure I will be buying low PE stocks, with attractive fundamentals.
4895 2018-02-21 05:18:37 No, just automatic weapons and bump stocks, thank you.  You can keep your penis-like rifles and guns to hunt and protect your families.  But if you need military grade weaponry and you're not a soldier, then you probably shouldn't have them.  Sensible; no need for vagina hats.
4896 2018-02-21 05:18:32 Bump stocks are a novelty . No shooter who cares about accuracy would use a bump stock . This will not prevent mass shootings and there is no history of one being used in a mass shooting .
4897 2018-02-21 05:18:15 Yes but that was before the introduction of bitcoin futures and budge bracket clearing firms. Since then, the correlations have been higher. The investor base is beginning to overlap, and because of that, bitcoin and stocks are starting to mirror each other more.
4898 2018-02-21 05:17:50 Keep your eyes on the ball. Trump proposing to ban bump stocks is just a distraction from gun reform and the Russia scandal.#TrumpColluded #RussianSanctions #GunReformNow #TrumpLies
4899 2018-02-21 05:17:28 Recommendation. I’m guessing they’re just waiting for things to blow over like they did with Las Vegas. They talked about banning bump stocks then, too.

4901 2018-02-21 05:17:10 Senator Feinstein advises that bump stocks aren't something you can do this through a mere regulation. There has to be a bill passed to create a law banning them.

4903 2018-02-21 05:15:21 I wholeheartedly agree with you with the bump stocks and large magazines, especially because a bump stock essentially does make it a war weapon, allowing it to act as an automatic.
4904 2018-02-21 05:15:18 Why not ban the AR-15 then the bump stocks would not be needed
4905 2018-02-21 05:14:55 We call BS, Distractor-in-Chief. This timing proves his motive insincere - nearly 600 Americans were shot by one man bcs bump stocks. 45 had no courage to do this months ago when Vegas happened. He is no leader. Merely an insecure puppet

4907 2018-02-21 05:14:36 Trump’s giving on bump stocks because he knows the NRA was ready to throw that bone after the LV mass shooting. 

Typical cowardly action from the Moron in Chief. WH sent late invites to kids from Parkland for tomorrow knowing they wouldn’t be able to attend and challenge him.
4908 2018-02-21 05:14:12 No. Fully automatic weapons are illegal without a proper license. This specified devices that convert semi-autos into pseudo-autos. It directly mentions bump stocks. Granted this wouldn’t help for what happened last week, but it’s a step. Just need more steps.

4911 2018-02-21 05:13:07 Yep, I don't see this as an infringement on our 2nd amendment. Trump won't let the libs take citizen's guns. I don't care about bump stocks.
4912 2018-02-21 05:13:06 Banning bump stocks isn’t enough and these monsters can’t bring themselves to do that. America is a hostage to stupidity and cruelty.

4916 2018-02-21 05:12:03 Some conservatives (and Trump now) are willing to discuss new gun control policies (ie tougher background checks, bump stocks, etc), but it needs to be done because they think it will truly help and not because they see it as an easy way to appease Dems....
4917 2018-02-21 05:11:56 Bump stocks are a gimmick, I wouldn't even want one

I love that you are leading on this issue, and putting forth common sense solutions that will save lives, while still protecting our constitutional rights. #2A
4920 2018-02-21 05:10:57 Get rid of bump stocks.
4921 2018-02-21 05:10:55 Look I understand what you are saying, but as you know most midgets like you said are committed with handguns. However we ban full bump stocks criminals will still get a hold of them. I don’t see why lotta biting citizens can’t have these things just because one insane guy!
4922 2018-02-21 05:10:47 I support any measure to make people safer, but bump stocks are pretty rudimentary, can be 3D printed or made from trash. Gives the GOP an undeserved out. Please don't let them get away with calling this a substantive compromise. This is a token little nothing for them.
4923 2018-02-21 05:10:39 GOP held bump stocks in reserve for the next mass shooting, which tells you just how truly evil they are, so they could "act" like they were doing something, but in reality just put off something they should've done back then. Now just dangling the carrot in front of the cart.
4924 2018-02-21 05:10:32 Bump stocks. He's working hard to alienate his base.
4925 2018-02-21 05:10:32 Tell that to the victims families of  the Las Vegas massacre. I'm sure they'd love to hear your take on bump stocks.
4926 2018-02-21 05:10:11 Sometimes I think @POTUS listens to his kids for advice. Ban Bump Stocks would have not prevented one death in Florida. SMH

4931 2018-02-21 05:08:20 @maddow the reason youre confused about why DJT is directing the justice department to do the thing on bump stocks is so it LOOKS like hes doing something.   And when it fails because hes doing it wrong he can say "I tried but THEY won't let me."
4932 2018-02-21 05:08:08 I’ve decided personally that I want a repeal of the second amendment and a total ban on private gun ownership. If people want to debate bump stocks and what constitutes an assault weapon that’s fine but it’s just micro-steps toward the real solution.
4933 2018-02-21 05:07:19 exciting stocks are happening
4934 2018-02-21 05:06:58 As long as real wages remain the way they have been - stagnant - deflation is actually better for stocks because more middle class people can invest, the drivers of bull markets (no selling). All we got now is hedge funds and day traders. No inflation until Americans get raises!
4935 2018-02-21 05:06:57 So Trump signed the bill outlawing bump stocks. How do you feel about this?
4936 2018-02-21 05:06:53 @NPR @npratc Headline ignores that shooter didn’t have bump stocks.
4937 2018-02-21 05:06:50 Bump stocks just aren't a hill anyone is ready to die on. They're literally just a toy. They're not useful in any serious level. Its an easy bone to throw at them.
4938 2018-02-21 05:06:28 sure trump..just like you said to bring a daca plan and you would sign it..then when you got it you had to add what you wanted for granting it..so what now..strike bump stocks..if everyone agrees to your stupid wall again..
4939 2018-02-21 05:05:46 President Trump, much to his credit, is now finally pushing for a ban on "bump stocks", which are described as a device that "turns a rifle into a machine gun". The rest of the western and civilized world scratches their heads that there could be any need to debate such a ban.
4940 2018-02-21 05:05:36 45 rounds per minute without bump stocks. Higher capacity means higher rate of fire even without modding. Add bump stocks for even higher.

4942 2018-02-21 05:05:05 Eh. I don't really care about Bump Stocks. They are just accessories/add-ons not a full blown weapon.
4943 2018-02-21 05:04:39 Bump stocks are stupid anyways no big loss there. Gun control is about hitting your target right.
4944 2018-02-21 05:04:36 Yes, the US is "special" in a very bad way there. The rapid fire thing hopefully will be addressed by getting rid of those goddamn "bump-stocks", as for high capacity, we are limited to 5 rounds for an AR mag up here. I think in CA it is 10 rounds. It should be nation-wide.
4945 2018-02-21 05:04:25 Because they fight any level of gun regulation and make rediculous claims and statements that are far right wing. No one needs an AR 15. Or bump stocks. Pistols for self defense?  Maybe..  maybe 1 or 2 shot pistols. Limits on ammunition.
4946 2018-02-21 05:04:21 Sorry, not familiar with that one at all. I see it’s based in Bermuda. I typically don’t hunt for dividend stocks outside the US for a variety of reasons. Hope it pulls out of its rut for you though!
4947 2018-02-21 05:04:01 I beg to differ. I only follow a few stocks...and don't ever recall one going on to be a success..... I only actively expose a few.... the absolute worst was OODH. that asshat "ceo"and I used to go at each other tooth and nail both in public on iHangout and in pm's.
4948 2018-02-21 05:03:35 Hmmmm he's pushing to ban add ons to weapons. Things like bump stocks. Not sure what you're talking about. Maybe be relevant and you can be in Cars 4. Dick.
4949 2018-02-21 05:03:29 Annalice is still searching for a huggable stuff toy cause she felt guilty about not buying immediately the one we both liked and now wala ng stocks 

And I'm feeling guilty na pinaguilty ko siya cause now nagmall hopping na siya para lang bumili 
4950 2018-02-21 05:03:10 Let 1000s of POC sit outside their convention with their open carry and concealed cary permits and weapons since none are allowed inside. Don't forget to bring your rifles and bump stocks to protest. The State of Texas has No laws about rifles even assault refiles . LET'S DO IT !
4951 2018-02-21 05:02:59 ps - I don't own a weapon beyond a kitchen knife. It's kind of the point. I'm arguing against guns, hence the example of why bump stocks make them scarier if you have to face one.
4952 2018-02-21 05:02:42 It was common wisdom that stocks were a great inflation hedge. Then the 70s happened. Stocks went nowhere. Walmart, by the way, became a major phenomenon in the 70s. Shoppers saw them as fighting high prices.
4953 2018-02-21 05:01:41 You're alienating your base. First you offer amnesty to nearly 2 million illegals, now you want to ban bump stocks. Careful if you want to remain in the White House for a 2nd term.
4954 2018-02-21 05:01:32 Definitely a step in the right direction for Trump to want to ban bump stocks
4955 2018-02-21 05:01:19 It can't happen soon enough. Now they need to organize a buy back of bump stocks already sold #GunReformNow
4956 2018-02-21 05:01:16 POTUS slightly caving to DEMS on gun control by banning bump stocks really jerks my chain, this could be a strategy for re-election to prove he's cooperative & willing find middle ground but DEMS have to start working with DJT too, on welfare & the wall, where's the QUID PRO QUO?
4957 2018-02-21 05:00:56 Remember when the Trump Cheerleaders in the Conservative Media (Hannity, Ingraham, Coulter and others) said conservatives who didn’t vote for Trump would own the Dems Gun Control laws. Well who’s owning Trump’s cave on banning Bump Stocks?
4958 2018-02-21 05:00:53 So many of these Congressmen as so ridiculously unreasonable. 

Look @ Constitution. Was a massive compromise by all.

Today, we can't even discuss getting rid of bump stocks, let alone AR15s with dozens of kids dead in shooting after shooting.
4959 2018-02-21 05:00:47 Trump has no leadership. He waits for others to force him into action like banning bump stocks. He should have done it right after the Las Vegas mass shooting.
4960 2018-02-21 05:00:42 It was a thought exercise, which is why words like pretend and exercise are used - oh and I never gave him my address which makes it a really shitty "threat". Still no argument for bump stocks huh?
4961 2018-02-21 05:00:41 @FredLucasWH No the NRA did not support a ban on bump stocks. They supported some vague “additional regulations.” Read the article you hyperlinked. Boy, you’re a real beacon of truth.
4962 2018-02-21 05:00:37 Coming together in the face of both tragedy & adversity for one cause: #GunReformNow #GunLawNow #ParklandStrong banning bump stocks alone is not enough @realDonaldTrump. @NRA #BloodMoney is of more value! #ISupportTheSecondAmendment #NoSupportForAssaultRifles.

4963 2018-02-21 05:00:23 Stay away from our 2A Kasich.

Trump wants ban of bump stocks expand background checks.
How about a bill addressing real killers in Ohio. mental health opiod addictions Homelessness 
Leaving children in home of the abuser
Human Trafficking (ohio ranked 4th highest in USA)
4964 2018-02-21 05:00:16 Traded margin on stocks - not at a flat rate, some required 100% equity and others less. Impossible to say
4965 2018-02-21 04:59:54 @realDonaldTrump if bump stocks get banned I'm not voting for or supporting you on anything else period
4966 2018-02-21 04:59:51 These stocks are no longer value plays but momentum plays. In the commodity space its very important to look forward and I don't think they have the same pricing upside as they had a yr ago
4967 2018-02-21 04:59:42 Don't think the left will be happy with bump stocks they are coming for our rifles next

4969 2018-02-21 04:58:57 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks
ONLY using Speech writers does Trump #SoundSane #BUT #HeStillLies&EvadesTheTruth
The slow measured way sound emits from his #MetrophonicPerformance Is #Eerie when he reads a speech
4970 2018-02-21 04:58:54 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U. S. national debts & public stocks owned by Chinese government, enterprises and oligarchs, (2) kick ALL the Chinese banks out of the SWIFT system, (3) change the regime in Beijing.
4971 2018-02-21 04:58:39 Today, Our President ordered the AG to ban Bump Stocks. This is a legal mod that turns semi-auto guns into bullet spraying automatic assault weapons. Don’t expect the media to praise this though, because it goes against the bash Trump agenda.
4972 2018-02-21 04:58:32 No bump stocks or high-capacity magazines?! So much for the tolerant left.
4973 2018-02-21 04:58:31 Best thing is to NOT ban bump-stocks. They wreck accuracy, thereby potentially saving lives if one is used vs not used.
4974 2018-02-21 04:58:17 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U. S. national debts & public stocks owned by Chinese government, enterprises and oligarchs, (2) kick ALL the Chinese banks out of the SWIFT system, (3) change the regime in Beijing.
4975 2018-02-21 04:58:04 Did anyone see Trumps speach on banning bump stocks, wondering, am I the only one who thinks that has to be one of the most pathetic attempts to be sincere. The tone of his voice was so false like he was giving a eulogy it was so fake.
4976 2018-02-21 04:56:59 trumpl$tilt$kin graciously cited a 'memorandum' which instructed sessions, in light of recent events, to place a ban on bump stocks. 
Great?! Maybe, but still skirting the issue! No bump stock was used in Parkland!
We don't WANT military weaponry available on our streets!
4977 2018-02-21 04:56:52 I wonder if trumps ban on bump fire stocks was just to quite liberal main stream media
4978 2018-02-21 04:56:51 You want “evidence based solutions”. What evidence do you have that banning bump stocks, a useless item used in exactly one crime ever, will reduce mass shootings?
4979 2018-02-21 04:56:31 You guys should have a good season this year. That's a nice looking team.
4980 2018-02-21 04:56:23 Well not those stocks. Some other stocks.
4981 2018-02-21 04:56:14 I think Trump is stupid.... but what if this is a plan to have the DOJ come down on Bumpfire stocks, just for it to go to the courts... and rule that accessories like bumpfire stocks and supressor are not modifications... and therefore can't be regulated as such...just a thought
4982 2018-02-21 04:56:05 Solutions. Lots. 1. Ban bump stocks and make penalties for possessing them severe. Same for all conversion kits. 2. No one under 21 owns a gun. Period. 3. Serious background checks and 30-day wait for a gun purchase. 4. No more than one gun purchase per year.
4983 2018-02-21 04:55:54 Our stock market currently worst in g7, USA stocks...up 21%.  But he is pretty so there's that.  Lol
4984 2018-02-21 04:55:52 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. AR-15 rifles are.
4985 2018-02-21 04:55:17 Nothingburger. Bump stocks can help speed of firing, but without skill & lots of practice will give up more in accuracy. Also, the device is simple enough to build, & the technique can be mastered with no added equipment at all with enough practice, so . . .
4986 2018-02-21 04:54:39 Let them eat bump stocks.
4987 2018-02-21 04:54:31 And experts state the the sounds a Mandalay bay say that it was fully automatics and not bump stocks that was heard.  Multiple shooters.
4988 2018-02-21 04:54:27 @realDonaldTrump - Mr. President, we don't need any more gun laws. The madman will always find a way to kill. Even if you ban bump stocks, the left won't be satisfied until all guns are banned. It's a death by a thousand cuts. If anything, we need less gun laws and restrictions.
4989 2018-02-21 04:54:18 Took long enough; should have been a no-brainer. Bump stocks should never have been ruled OK in the first place.
4990 2018-02-21 04:54:12 Banning bump stocks would not have prevented the Florida school shooting.
4991 2018-02-21 04:54:11 Basically a 1v1 killed myself 3 times cuz 2v1 for 3 stocks is boring :(
4992 2018-02-21 04:53:45 You trying to figure out what those letters stand for? Or do you just lack a real argument for bump stocks.
4993 2018-02-21 04:53:44 Bump stocks could disappear tomorrow, I wouldn’t care.

BUT… if the government pulls some kind of trickery to ban them without actually following the law, we could all be in for some deep trouble down the road.

I insist that they do it properly, without infringing other rights.
4994 2018-02-21 04:53:43 I challenged a guy a while back. Since like 18xx year, every time stocks have had 8 consecutive years of gains, the following year was negative 100% of the time. #eatthatstat
4995 2018-02-21 04:53:32 Except bumpfire stocks don't "turn" semi automatics into automatics.
4996 2018-02-21 04:53:23 Since Trump alleges that he told DOJ to review legality of bump stocks in October, who was working on it? I would not be surprised if Trump was just lying. @maddow DOJ should easily be able to inform.
4997 2018-02-21 04:53:08 Banning guns or bump stocks won’t stop gun violence. Why is it people can’t understand that. And it won’t make it harder to get. Close one avenue 100 more open up. My  goes out to families in FL but more die from alcohol annually then guns do in five years. Wake up folks.
4998 2018-02-21 04:53:00 Criminals with bump stocks will keep theirs, they don't obey gun laws. Bump stocks can easily be made at home and you can imitate bump stock fire by using your belt loop and your trigger finger. Look on you tube.
4999 2018-02-21 04:52:57 Add Der Donald to those opposed, according to Faux News. He wants to ban bump stocks..... Really Conservative, huh? 
5000 2018-02-21 04:52:34 Not good news at all.  Reevaluate your stance on this.  No authority to regulate firearm accessories.  Bump stocks do not turn semiautos into machine guns or “assault” weapons (fake term).
5001 2018-02-21 04:51:59 Yep, it's like the hysteria over bump stocks. Take him seriously but not literally.
5002 2018-02-21 04:51:58 Why did Obama approve bump stocks in the first place?
5003 2018-02-21 04:51:53 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks??! Is that it? Trying to keep the kids quiet because they are way more intelligent?
5004 2018-02-21 04:51:50 That is not caving. Even the NRA was okay with getting rid of bump stocks.
5005 2018-02-21 04:51:48 Top 5 stocks ?
5006 2018-02-21 04:51:34 @_soniashenoy - Are stocks of jbf industry a good buy ?
5007 2018-02-21 04:51:34 It isn’t a matter of "defending" them. I don’t care about them at all.

What I care about is government properly following the law.

And I’m telling you that bump stocks are a BIG legal problem, if the government want to ban them.
5008 2018-02-21 04:51:18 Banning guns or bump stocks will never fix the real issue here
5009 2018-02-21 04:51:08 No, we don’t. Besides being an infringement they’ve done NOTHING to stop bad people from acquiring guns. Pushing on this issue and the banning of bump stocks may cost you the mid term election....
5010 2018-02-21 04:51:00 RT @IDIG_INVESTMENT: $OTTV CAN ACHEIVE THE REVENUE OF COMCAST WITH A MUCH LOWER OPERATIONAL COST. #PENNYSTOCKS #STOCKS ~> YES I JUST SAID…
5011 2018-02-21 04:50:27 It’s a serious situation that NDP laughed at today- they gave many groups (business people, activists)advance notice of what they were going to do-they should have known that people could trade on that information either short selling KM or even buying renewable energy stocks.
5012 2018-02-21 04:50:25 "Bump-stocks" is not a hill I would advise risking casualties to defend. As a modification which makes a popular legal weapon function as an illegal weapon, that hill is far outside the perimeter, & current battlefield. Dump the liabilities & concentrate on preserving the assets.

5014 2018-02-21 04:50:13 People who are complaining about trump proposing a ban on bump stocks are people who shouldn't be a part of the gun control debate. You really can't just give up this one useless attachment?
5015 2018-02-21 04:49:46 Obama approved bump stocks. The left are all hypocrites.
5016 2018-02-21 04:49:35 Dotards deflection is so

5017 2018-02-21 04:49:29 - Barcelona - David Hogg - Post Malone - Rihanna - Jackson Memorial Middle School - Bump Stocks Definition…
5018 2018-02-21 04:49:17 Bump stocks are trash anyway. I get the line in the sand concept. This just isn’t it for me.
5019 2018-02-21 04:49:06 Guess I was thinking longer term. Wasn’t saying calling EPS on tax short term is important, more like which companies can generate more FCF long term that don’t have to pass it along to customers. I can’t provide many example of stocks popping on this but I feel like some should
5020 2018-02-21 04:48:56 I thought stocks were the perfect inflation hedge?
5021 2018-02-21 04:48:51 I love it. I too am a #DGI but I do own some growth stocks. Feel that I have to in todays market. I always struggle with it though because I do strongly believe in the #DGI way but feel the market gives a lot of love to the growth names. $XPO $TCEHY $SQ $NVDA $NFLX for example.
5022 2018-02-21 04:48:47 Yes President T. we really do need to strengthen background checks and a longer waiting period instead of 3 days maybe 7-10 to make sure all background checks are clean & nothing pops up on a person! Banning bump stocks is needed and high powered rifles need to be looked at again
5023 2018-02-21 04:48:39 It’s not enough. Regulating accessories (suppressors, bump stocks, AR-mounted scopes, etc) none of it will be enough. It has to be the weapon itself. Not to mention increased background checks, mental health screenings, and the like.
5024 2018-02-21 04:48:32 Is that all the victims mowed down with AR-15 are worth? Bump stocks? tRump needs to go back to his boy and tell him to ban AR-15s too.
5025 2018-02-21 04:48:30 the same way he wants to solve DACA? please, asking the DOJ to look into bump stocks will go nowhere, and he knows it.
5026 2018-02-21 04:48:24 Technically, bump stocks are already illegal. They alter the operation of the weapon and make it fully automatic.
5027 2018-02-21 04:48:16 President Cracker thinks banning bump stocks will be enough to placate them pesky kids. Hopefully, that’s way too little and much too late. #MarchForOurLives #GunReformNow
5028 2018-02-21 04:48:12 Wow bro....that requires lot of guts & self belief! 

As you said you grew from $20k to $100k in approx 5 months...what was the ratio of leverage to cash that you used? 

Also did you only trade on margin in stocks or did u also traded futures/options?
5029 2018-02-21 04:48:08 Historically, high inflation is terrible for stocks. There's only one thing worse for stocks than inflation -- deflation.
5030 2018-02-21 04:47:01 #WakeUpUSA Joe,when did he "direct" The AG to do this?

I heard him say he sent memo about" looking into bump stocks but the ATF has do a study first that might take a year" tot eh AG..
if U have something that shows DJT actually DIRECTED the AG to do ANYTHING I'd like to see it.
5031 2018-02-21 04:46:45 Warren Buffett has always been a firm believer that staying invested in stocks is the only course.

5032 2018-02-21 04:46:42 @POTUS  I'm gonna speak without a filter,  trying to appease the left and fix the problem in regards to mass shootings is not outlawing bumer stocks

 We need to fix the communication between lawn enforcement and mental health staff and school officials
5033 2018-02-21 04:46:41 Trump talks about "background checks" & bump stocks. That's the BEST he can do without angering his base! A background check should've done on HIM. Trump hasn't got a shred of decency in him. Had a killing happened in HIS FAMILY he'd probably have the same stance. #disgusted

Propose that licensed teachers be allowed to carry concealed in the classroom. That will FIX the mass school shooting problem. It takes guns to stop guns. Fact of life.

5039 2018-02-21 04:43:54 Im obviously not a trump supporter but im thankful he's agreeing to push a ban on bump stocks. I'd like to see more gun regulation in the future, but i'm at least happy to see some progress :)
5040 2018-02-21 04:43:38 Ban on bump stocks….well, the solutions for less shootings…ok, you will kill less people in the same time.

Stupid USA
5041 2018-02-21 04:42:48 That's nice but I'd rather the country ban bump stocks, weapons of war, imposes strict background checks, and bans ppl with mental problems from being able to buy weapons
5042 2018-02-21 04:42:43 Outlying bumper stocks is not gonna fix the problem. we need to fix the mental health care problem in this country and the communication between lawn enforcement and mental health care staff field@mike_pence
5043 2018-02-21 04:42:36 The Constitution does NOT give the right for civilians to be armed with AR-15s, bump stocks or other such devices. The founders were writing about muskets and the right to form militias in order to fight a tyrannical government.

#stocks #Nifty #investing #equity
5045 2018-02-21 04:41:38 So @realDonaldTrump is “urging” the ban of bump stocks, the one item the NRA has said they’d happily ban after the Las Vegas shooting as a way to shut people up over stricter gun laws and background checks. Well we know who’s paying for 45.
5046 2018-02-21 04:41:37 Why ban bump stocks if you can still purchase an AR-15? Shouldn't we ban both? Why does anyone need an assault weapon? 

#guncontrol #BanAR15
5047 2018-02-21 04:41:10 I agree with all of this Bryan, expect bump stocks. I’m totally ok with those being banned and illegal. And I’m one of the biggest 2nd amendment supporters and anti-banning anything firearm related people you know.
5048 2018-02-21 04:40:52 Article by a kid today showed that you have to be 21 to buy a pistol, but only 18 to buy a gun with a stock. AR-15s come w/o stocks so at the gun store the 20 year old was told to buy a stock to get the AR-15 before his 21st birthday. The gun laws we have are like Swiss cheese.
5049 2018-02-21 04:40:15 The thing that drives me nuts about tv pundits who say, "I don't know anyone who'd be against a ban on bump stocks, on any side of the aisle": why wasn't such a bill introduced the day after Vegas? Obvs people are against it, or at least afraid of making waves by supporting it
5050 2018-02-21 04:40:15 Precisely. Today, the trump admin announced efforts to “ban” bump stocks. (A stupid toy whose loss would be fine with me). Nothing but crickets from the left. He could announce confiscation of all guns tomorrow, and they would protest.

It’s all about the issue...

5052 2018-02-21 04:40:07 So isn't the thing about bump stocks that it's just physics? Convert the recoil into another trigger pull? If this gets them to shut up then great but they'll be back

5054 2018-02-21 04:39:24 Agreed. Picking up Jake Lever despite giving up a first round draft pick was actually a good move which helps their defensive stocks majorly, and he's still young. Of course Max Gawn had to sit out 12 weeks last year and Jesse Hogan through personal reasons.
5055 2018-02-21 04:39:14 First “Bump stocks”.... now “background checks”.... okay, okay, I hear ‘ya.... Can we hit the trifecta and stop the sale of assault weapons?
5056 2018-02-21 04:38:56 Bump stocks increase the rate of fire. Regulating them would mean you also have to regulate competition triggers, polished trigger and even the human finger. You would also have to look into a standard trigger pull weight. Big can of worms not gonna happen. #protect2A
5057 2018-02-21 04:38:28 @MichelleUgenti, @jlawrenceLD23 You both voted to stop HB2023. To ban sales of bump stocks. You should both be ashamed of yourselves especially Michelle who has three young children in school.
5058 2018-02-21 04:38:23 An announcement was made about the possibility of bump stocks being banned after the last shooting...causing people to rush out and buy them all up. This time everyone is targeting AR-15's so they will be the next gun to fly off the shelves. What a joke.
5059 2018-02-21 04:38:06 Moron: "We must do more to protect our children". So he bans bump stocks. Used once, by an idiot, and not in attacks on schools. He can't say a word not approved by the NRA. And then, there's that $30M NRA campaign money. 
5060 2018-02-21 04:37:47 So apparently @realDonaldTrump thinks he's going to pacify these kids from #Parkland by calling for a ban on bump stocks. (used by the VEGAS shooter) How stupid do you think these kids are Donnie?  #ParklandStudents #BanAssaultWeapons
5061 2018-02-21 04:37:38 And outlawing bump stocks. And keep guns away from those with mental health issues. And limit high capacity magazines. And reinstate the federal assault weapons ban. And mandatory trigger locks. And.....
5062 2018-02-21 04:37:30 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks would be one step towards common sense gun control. I know AR15’s are best sellers, because the NRA brags about that, but AR15 and similar weapons have no place on the streets of America. Ban them!
5063 2018-02-21 04:37:28 @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @maddow what's with the little 'clear feed' into #45*'s ear during his talk about bump stocks today?  Looked a little like a hearing aid...?
5064 2018-02-21 04:37:17 I started trading stocks today. Made a dollar my first day. Not bad at all for first day lol
5065 2018-02-21 04:37:11 Trump is calling for a ban on bump stocks. Alright, I'm listening.
5066 2018-02-21 04:37:04 except...bump stocks were a thing during the LAST mass shooting.. y'all are a little late. Maybe when the next group of people die due to automatic weapons lawmakers will finally do something worthy of anything.
5067 2018-02-21 04:36:31 No sir it starts with getting sanity back into our Country and establishing the most rigid gun control legislation throughout the land including the ban of ALL military type weapons, multi-magazines and bum stocks. Also the most rigid background checks in the world. Enough!!
5068 2018-02-21 04:36:27 While the comment re Donny’s progress as a reader was mine, it was Ali Velshi who reported the absurdity of Donny’s announcement the bump stocks.
5069 2018-02-21 04:36:23 Magazine should be limited, bump stocks banned.
5070 2018-02-21 04:36:17 Listen @Potus. Bump stocks are not the problem. Assault rifles are. Focus on getting rid of the real promblem. No civilian “NEEDS” an assault rifle.

5073 2018-02-21 04:34:59 The reason bump stocks aren’t banned yet is because it sounds too much like a brand of cock ring so legislators are confused.
5074 2018-02-21 04:34:57 @realDonaldTrump  You ban bump stocks and you'll lose this voter.
5075 2018-02-21 04:34:52 Am I the only one who saw that @realDonaldTrump introduced gun reform that will ban bump stocks or is that not the kind of news #angrytwitter  likes to talk about ?
5076 2018-02-21 04:34:44 He is giving up nothing most if not all NRA supporters agree with.  Bump stocks and background checks.  It’s something for nothing.  It makes them feel better.  Just roll with it.
5077 2018-02-21 04:34:30 @realDonaldTrump decided to ban bump stocks which weren’t even used in FL. Did just enough to not piss off the NRA and not enough to actually make kids safe. Worst POTUS ever.

5081 2018-02-21 04:33:48 A little late Dotard in Chief.. the company that manufacturers bump stocks recently went belly up so it makes total sense you would do this now as no financial loss to you or the NRA,

5085 2018-02-21 04:33:10 I agree this is reasonable as bump stocks only exist to essentially break a law by making a gun automatic.
5086 2018-02-21 04:33:08 Let's just ban all semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
5087 2018-02-21 04:32:48 Don't worry, he won't. There will be tightened ristrictions on gun purchase regulations and no more bump stocks but that is it.
5088 2018-02-21 04:32:44 After any mass shooting, gun sales increase and gun manufacturer stocks go up. Remington just filed for bankruptcy , because fears of gun controls lessened after trump was elected. Bet AR15 style guns are sold out in Fl.
5089 2018-02-21 04:32:24 @CNN Really Jack? I’ll answer by saying probably “none”. Now I’ll ask you some questions, how many own semi-automatic weapons or weapons with bump stocks? Won’t answer the wall question, since that is THE MOST idiotic question I heard. That is just dumb shit.
5090 2018-02-21 04:32:20 I don’t think bump stocks are manufactured by major NRA people.
5091 2018-02-21 04:32:19 Great questions. Or what about stocks? Can they seize my phone to check my robinhood account?

5096 2018-02-21 04:31:44 Facts: Republicans let Fed Assault Weapons Ban expire in 2004; Jeb Bush signed the 1st Stand Your Ground Law in FL. Repubs control ALL 3 branches of govt & couldn’t repeal bump stocks after #LasVegasShooting. Trump & Repub Senators received over $50M in #NRABloodMoney.

5104 2018-02-21 04:30:04 what happens to the bump stocks after they are declared illegal? They will be “destroyed”......then “thrown in the trash”.....then wind up in the hands of crooks across the country....see: CHICAGO...
5105 2018-02-21 04:30:01 As a lifelong hunter and shooter I don't see the need for silencers, bump stocks and huge mags. Person to person transfers could be done via FFL dealers as with gun shows. Radical changes - no! Sensible ideas - yes.
5106 2018-02-21 04:29:43 It’s not whether bump stocks remain legal, but what they’ll have to redefine. Mark my words, this is a slippery slope that inevitably leads to banning semi-autos. 

Go ahead and ridicule now, but take a screenshot so you can look back later.
5107 2018-02-21 04:29:41 If you regulate Bump Stocks they will just become more popular and cost more. Especially on the street.
5108 2018-02-21 04:29:40 It would take more than just banning bump stocks..triggers can be adjusted, and there are many devices as well, that can increase firing...we must do more!!!! #MarchForOurLives #neveragainmovement
5109 2018-02-21 04:29:26 President Trump is cleverly going along with what the Democrats are screaming for up to a point. Bump stocks ban. Strengthening background checks. He knows they don't do anything to stop mass shooting. But he'll go along with their charade to show how pointless it is.
5110 2018-02-21 04:29:19 >trump banning bump stocks
this is pretty pointless, bump firing a gun is already a meme
5111 2018-02-21 04:29:02 Banning ‘Bump Stocks’ is a good start.
5112 2018-02-21 04:28:34 What's the finish is the question and I have no prob banning bump stocks but what's the end game in your opinion
5113 2018-02-21 04:28:26 You can’t ban bump stocks because 1) you can easily make them 2) 3D printers(see 1) 3) you can bump fire without any modification needed 4) so what’s the point of banning them?
5114 2018-02-21 04:28:06 But gun manufacturers that support the NRA don’t make the bump stocks, so teeny, tiny, cowardly step forward.

5122 2018-02-21 04:26:19 Trump directs DOJ to determine bump stocks illegal under current law using common sense. With that he’s done more than Congress or Obama re gun control & isn’t done. Isn’t Obama the legal scholar? Then again, Trump banned bump stocks while Holder fed automatic weapons to cartels
5123 2018-02-21 04:26:11 @NRA Please fight the ban on bump stocks. A ban will not fix anything!
5124 2018-02-21 04:26:03 First two stocks and yields then reversal.
5125 2018-02-21 04:25:52 @POTUS  U need to leave the 2nd Amendment alone. U can ban every gun & the next WK can have anthr mass shooting like N FL. with the same gun thy wnt banned. Libs don't care about bump stocks, thy wnt all guns. We banned drugs,did thy stop it. No U want my vote N 20 leave it alone
5126 2018-02-21 04:25:48 Our president is such a joke.He didn't want to talk about banning bump stocks after Las Vegas where one was actually used,but now that he's being upstaged by intellectually  superior high school kids he wants to grab the spotlight back.America is being run like reality Tv.
5127 2018-02-21 04:25:44 They have spent millions of dollars in character assassination campaigns against republicans that offer even modest gun regulations, and despite initial lip service to restrictions to things like bump stocks and magazine capacity, they eventually convince politicians to drop it..
5128 2018-02-21 04:25:41 It was actually more measured than I was expecting, although I'm too lazy to find it again.  Presumably they're interpreting "shoot...more than one shot" with a "single function of the trigger" (machinegun definition) to include the behavior provided by bump stocks.
5129 2018-02-21 04:25:39 You STILL think Obama is coming for your guns? Assault weapons should be illegal, large magazines should be illegal and bump stocks should be illegal. Most agree lay people should not be able to have guns that kill hundreds of people in seconds.
5130 2018-02-21 04:25:38 Background checks, bump stocks, mag size can be addressed. But everytime someone says ar15 is an assault weapon they already lost because mechanical and technical it is not. So ur not banning it or u have to ban every 223 remington round hunting rifle. Not happening.
5131 2018-02-21 04:25:31 @NBCNews -- someone had to explain to trump about 'bump stocks', he thought it was a move done by pole dancers! SAD!
5132 2018-02-21 04:24:46 He doesn’t really want to - meanwhile sales of bump stocks will increase in anticipation - he wouldn’t make a move without consulting with NRA and his other corrupt gun industry moguls and getting their approval. It’s a cynical, disingenuous PR move.

5135 2018-02-21 04:23:31 I can't believe you weren't "outraged" when President Obama failed these kids by not passing any gun laws the 2 years he had supermajorities in the Senate and House and who's ATF repeatedly declared Bump Stocks legal. So disgusting

5137 2018-02-21 04:23:20 They know Russian bots are pushing gun control, so now he wants to ban bump stocks. Trump is either too stupid to realize he's playing right into their hands, or he's working with them.
5138 2018-02-21 04:23:01 Ban Bump Stocks and strengthen background checks. Damn. I'm shocked. This is a good start.
5139 2018-02-21 04:22:55 It's not really either.  He instructed the ATF to continue going through the federal regulatory process (including proposing rules and putting them out for public review and comment in the Federal Register" to ban bump stocks using existing laws as justification. Memo's online

5149 2018-02-21 04:22:19 I recall a teacher telling me the story of a tycoon in the late ‘20s getting his shoes shined, the man shining his shoes proceeded to give the tycoon advice on stocks. Following which, the tycoon pulled ALL his money from banks, sold his stock. The next day the market crashed.
5150 2018-02-21 04:22:12 Holy shit trump is planning to ban bump stocks!! I havnt seen conservatives this angry cince President Obama was re-elected. 
5151 2018-02-21 04:22:05 The Cheeto-in-Chief has called for a federal rule banning bump stocks but I have one simple question for him: What the futz took you so damned long?!?!?
5152 2018-02-21 04:22:02 Bump Stocks about to get banned by Trump.
5153 2018-02-21 04:21:59 I'm willing to give up bump stocks to say to a leftist that Trump did more for a gun control than Obama did. Now if they'd just leave those poor kids in Florida alone and let them grieve instead of indoctrinating them.
5154 2018-02-21 04:21:42 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr. Banning bumpstocks makes no logical sense. The Florida shooter wasn't using a bump stocks. How about making JUVENILE records public record so we know who these dangerous ppl are. Let's start with transparent JUVENILE records
5155 2018-02-21 04:21:37 Reports say Trump’s told DOJ to look into creating regulations to prohibit sale of “bump stocks.” DON’T BELIEVE IT! Trump & GOP have no intention of pursuing real gun control. It’s a PR move; a cheap distraction from their indifference to carnage & killing.
5156 2018-02-21 04:21:35 @realDonaldTrump Why are we talking about bump stocks, when we should be talking about how ALL divisions of security should be in touch with each other. If local cops know they've gone to a house 39 times, then so should the state police, FBI and DHS! #MAGA #MolonLabe

5158 2018-02-21 04:21:25 Yeah but bump stocks defeat the purpose of fully automatic guns being illegal lol
5159 2018-02-21 04:21:14 Too late. That should have been done after Vegss. Bump stocks weren’t used in Florida. Ban SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS !

5164 2018-02-21 04:20:29 I thought they wanted to ban bump stocks before and Obummer vetoed it.
5165 2018-02-21 04:20:26 But attacking bump stocks as if they were even used in Vegas POTUS will only alienate your base. You direct the DOJ to ban bump stocks, but you don't direct them to stop illegal entry or to jail law breaking mayors a city councils who allow illegals to enter & even protect them.
5166 2018-02-21 04:20:22 5things you need to know today:

2. Russian Trolls aren't mythical creatures
3. Asia stocks up because everything is awesome. 
4. Yen legs jelly as Kuroda will never give up.
5. Do you really think there are 5 things to talk abt?
5167 2018-02-21 04:19:52 Trump is bluffing about bump stocks.
ATF has already said it doesn't have the authority to regulate them.
If it goes ahead anyway, gun merchants will sue, and probably win.
As @NancyPelosi says, this can only be done by legislation.
And the time to legislate is now.
5168 2018-02-21 04:19:49 I can't believe President Obama failed these kids by not passing any gun laws the 2 years he had supermajorities in the Senate and House and who's ATF repeatedly declared Bump Stocks legal. So disgusting
5169 2018-02-21 04:19:41 My advice put aside a nice chunk for savings and a smaller chunk for stocks (after you pay your necessary bills). It adds up
5170 2018-02-21 04:19:22 Trump knew there was a consensus on Bump stocks, so an easy give! If he really wanted to help, he should suggest for real changes. Ban AR15 and similar weapons, universal background checks- interstate wide linked. Mental alert at least temp bans on purchasing.
5171 2018-02-21 04:19:17 RT JoeNBC: The president deserves thanks for taking an important first step on gun safety laws by directing the AG to ban bump stocks. Let’s hope expanded background checks are next so we can keep military-style guns out of the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers and the m…
5172 2018-02-21 04:19:02 So what the hell is POTUS up to with that memo?! They clearly do not make them into machine guns by the legal definition. “Single function of the trigger.” He has no legal authority to take action against bump stocks. It would take a new law.
5173 2018-02-21 04:18:39 It's not the Dems or Reps, it's the NRA. Has .@POTUS heard from them yet? BTW: Besides bkgnd chks (incl. within families), bump stocks, nat'l DB, & assault rifles must be focused on. ONLY these would help much!
5174 2018-02-21 04:18:22 Absolutely not far enough for Donald Trump to call for a ban of bump stocks: Trump could have done that immediately after the Las Vegas shooting. #ThrowThemOut #BanAssaultWeapons #GunReformNOW #MarchForOurLives

5176 2018-02-21 04:18:12 @SenFeinstein 
I no longer listen to me Feinstein after her collusion with #FusionGPS .

However, Massachusetts made bump stocks illegal. Any state has judicial authority to regulate the 2nd amendment. More so than the President and federal government. #AR15s are illegal in Mass.
5177 2018-02-21 04:18:12 Wouldn't you think farmers, who provide life sustaining food, would be a higher priority? Not providing farmers water is similar to eating the seed corn, or making a meal of the breeding stocks. But California is not known for good decision making.
5178 2018-02-21 04:18:07 Bump stocks are legal and don’t turn legal weapons into machine guns, so...
5179 2018-02-21 04:18:00 And instead of blaming party lines for the tragedy, I'll say again, forget your political stance, and offer constructive thoughts on how to fix our kids dying. Trump banning bump stocks is a good first step - and I give him credit for it, but just a band-aid.
5180 2018-02-21 04:17:49 @realDonaldTrump you pass or sign legislation banning bump stocks or other like devices count on no support come election time. Goes for any rep
5181 2018-02-21 04:17:35 Don’t need bump stocks, let’s get real banning a rifle is not going to make our children safe, I don’t expect joe to have any ideas,he can’t even be faithful , real family man#pullyourheadout
5182 2018-02-21 04:17:15 No, he didn’t use a bump stock. Trump is simply picking a subject (bump stocks) that the NRA has already said it wouldn’t mind seeing regulated. No gun sales will be affected. Trump doesn’t lose credibility with the NRA.
5183 2018-02-21 04:17:11 The 1st gun reform we need is a total BAN of all assault rifles. Any candidate that doesn’t say that should be threatened with losing his job in the next election cycle. We also don’t need bump stocks. extended clips and ghost guns. The 6, million NRA members can fuck off!
5184 2018-02-21 04:17:00 Stocks in Ban Period:  
BALRAMCHIN,

5185 2018-02-21 04:16:59 I can't believe President Obama failed them by not passing any gun laws the 2 years he had supermajorities in the Senate and House and who's ATF repeatedly declared Bump Stocks legal. So disgusting
5186 2018-02-21 04:16:54 Retweeted Nov8Reelection (@4YrsToday):

Will @realDonaldTrump listen to the NRA when they tell him to not ban bump stocks?
5187 2018-02-21 04:16:33 @CKforCleanIndia @CIIPresident @anjali_damania @KiritSomaiya banks must c for existing loans-r companies hv inflated stocks in buks/doing fake sales to satisfy  bank staff! @TVMohandasPai @sunilalagh @PandaJay @rajeev_mp @nishikant_dubey @sureshpprabhu @SecretaryDEA @RajivKumar1
5188 2018-02-21 04:16:30 Let's give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He has consistently not done anything that is not a win-win for him. He gave up bump stocks. The shooting  community considers them stupid. He wants to raise the age of purchasing ARs to 21. Just like handguns. Not a big loss.
5189 2018-02-21 04:16:29 Bump stocks? We talking about guns or the stock market?
5190 2018-02-21 04:16:24 how about it stocks rupee weaker can they move
5191 2018-02-21 04:16:23 Bump Stocks are covered under the second amendment but @realDonaldTrump put a ban on them. #DACA is a fancy term for #illegals but Trump and @DNC want to make them legal. What the hell is wrong with you morons? @NRA @FoxNews @GunOwners @IngrahamAngle
5192 2018-02-21 04:15:51 I don’t give a rats ass about bump stocks in and of themselves, but that’s really not the point is it? The government is infringing on our god given rights. This is not acceptable.
5193 2018-02-21 04:15:48 With a knick knack paddy whack 
Give a dog a bone 
Trump to regulate bump stocks owned

Bump stocks, huh? They're so last mass murder.

How about banning #SemiAutomatics & #BanAssaultWeapons that just killed at #Parkland.

#ParklandStrong do not let #Fake45 throw U a bone.
5194 2018-02-21 04:15:36 It's never "the time" but there certainly are enough times to die by guns lately. How many @SpeakerRyan ? How many children have to die? Background check, banning bumper stocks, and not allowing Assault Weapons ISN'T taking anything from 2nd amendment rights. Safety FIRST
5195 2018-02-21 04:15:28 The list of stocks trading at or near low risk entries  will continue to increase as we consolidate the recent gains assuming the market does not fall apart and retest the lows from earlier this month
5196 2018-02-21 04:15:16 @foxnewsnight Not agreeing with @ChrisStirewalt about not taking action on bump stocks being a future Republican problem. Obama had 8 years to fix healthcare and didn't even address mental health issues so now it's a GOP problem?
5197 2018-02-21 04:15:14 How does banning bump stocks help get the actual gun out of people’s hands? 
That’s just a scrap that needed to come out.  Trump fixed nothing
5198 2018-02-21 04:15:09 @realDonaldTrump I agree Bump Stocks need to go.     BUT, prevention in schools must happen ASAP. Our children need to be protected like our pretty politicians.
Thanks for everything you do for our country and our children.

5200 2018-02-21 04:14:52 banning bump stocks will get mass shooting fatalities down from 50 to a dozen or two. 
unless the shooter already has one.
is this what the GOP plans to run on in 259 days? a bump stock ban?
5201 2018-02-21 04:14:48 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks & making the age for semiautomatic rifles 21 sounds logical, but don't go PC on the base! Sanctity of all life is needed, ban abortions! The democrats have support of abortion in their political platform!
5202 2018-02-21 04:14:44 1st of all he is The President (yours too) 2nd he has started looking into different things including calling for a national ban of bump stocks. He’s also looking into strickter back ground checks. . Next I would hope he repeals H.J. Res 40., then more restrictions @ gun shows
5203 2018-02-21 04:14:40 As one of those vampires id say banning bump stocks is a fake gesture at best. In fact this is the 2nd time they’ve been banned since Vegas. And if you really feel this way please direct your thoughts to the survivors of the attacks and tell them this is enough
5204 2018-02-21 04:14:34 Recognized weapon expert Chris Stirewalt appears on Fox to discuss bump stocks. I look forward to watching not-Fox
5205 2018-02-21 04:14:26 Live today afternoon on Zee Business Channel from 12pm to 12.20pm for market view and stocks  ideas, Dt 21-02-2018
5206 2018-02-21 04:14:08 It's only legal if the main guns aren't operational. So you can own it, but not at it's full person-killing capabilities. Which I know doesn't change things in your argument, but makes it more baffling to me that bump stocks are still hard to ban.
5207 2018-02-21 04:13:58 Trump bans bump stocks he's a dollar late and a dime short the movement of no more is in full swing assult weapons are out or gop is out
5208 2018-02-21 04:13:55 Something seems weird in the chart patterns, no? Maybe Luke Gromen is right on this. The BOP situation of the USA is bad and people are racing out of the dollar into stocks, then gold??
5209 2018-02-21 04:13:48 Like bump stocks were used in Vegas & A lone man did all that shooting and chaos.
POTUS with this move has fired a shot across the bow of his base, especially 2nd amendmenters.
For the 1st time I am ashamed of a political decision he has made for pure politics.
5210 2018-02-21 04:13:36 Gun Control or Pacifiers? 
If bump stocks are banned criminals will still get them on the black market. 
Raising the age to buy a gun to age 21 because younger people are not mature enough.  Hmm... 19 year old criminals will get them on the black market. @POTUS @jeffsessions

5212 2018-02-21 04:13:26 BUMP STOCKS WERE MADE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ... GUN CONTROL IDIOTS WANT TO TAKE AWAY RIGHTS FROM DISABLED PEOPLE? #foxnewsatnight
5213 2018-02-21 04:13:20 You are mistaking being in favor for reasonable limits on gun ownership as being "anti-gun".

Strong background checks, 21-year-old minimum for purchase, no bump stocks.... these are all reasonable and don't infringe on your 2nd amendment rights.
5214 2018-02-21 04:13:10 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
5215 2018-02-21 04:12:50 I have to know what bum stocks are used for other than hacking guns before I take a vote.
5216 2018-02-21 04:12:39 YOU HAVE /HAD PAGE WITH STOCKS AND TRENDING STATISTIC STATISTICAL STATISTICS SEND POST HASTE TO ME godeternaleternally@gmail.com

@SwingTraderstoc
5217 2018-02-21 04:12:09 Right. How many mass shootings have there been since LV, and you're FINALLY getting around to thinking about banning bump stocks and background checks? And at the same time still trying to claim it's all mental health (while cutting funds for mental health). #TwoFacesOfTrump
5218 2018-02-21 04:11:50 Outlaw knives as well?They kill more people than bump stocks?What about cars?Handguns? All kill more than bump stocks. How bout we have armed security at schools. Medal detectors.
9/11 we blame the terrorist,
drunk driver kills we blame the driver,
Mass shooting we blame the gun
5219 2018-02-21 04:11:29 But how do you define "Assault weapon?" and since bump stocks are just plastic and can be 3d printed very cheaply how do you ban them? Logically those knee jerk reactions aren't realistic or effective.
5220 2018-02-21 04:11:04 Are you going to do anything? Propose to ban bump stocks or limiting high capacity magazines or upgrading the antiquated tracing system used for background checks? Anything?
5221 2018-02-21 04:10:41 I’m the farthest thing from a trump supporter, but I can honestly say he is right for pushing a ban on bump stocks & better backgrounds checks
5222 2018-02-21 04:10:30 Tough sell, there.  Bump stocks may be the sacrificial lamb
5223 2018-02-21 04:10:05 @IngrahamAngle Did u know Bump stocks and how they work?? I tell U U don't need a bump stock to fire fast.. I won't say it here and how to do it. People that know guns know.. Believe me it's so easy..............
5224 2018-02-21 04:10:05 Sir, please leave bump stocks alone. They were only supposedly used in one shooting. It’s the tip of the iceberg when it comes to restricting gun rights to hard working, God Fearing, honest Americans. Thank you sir. -A concerned Navy Veteran.
5225 2018-02-21 04:09:34 As it is, the job market is corroded by all manner of factors including tech disruption, nepotism etc. I know a teacher who works at a bank, a banker who teaches, An engineer doing Insurance sales and a lawyer trading in stocks. Its tough outhere!
5226 2018-02-21 04:09:32 @RealDonadTrump Your proposal to ban Bump Stocks is a JOKE.  Seriously one jackass uses one and now you want to ban it.  How about banning Pressure Cookers?  What's next? Banning AR's?  Then there WILL BE A PROBLEM.
5227 2018-02-21 04:09:31 Today's pullback was exactly what this market needs.  The straight up action over past week makes it much harder to find quality setups.  Aside from the NASDAQ, all major averages are below their 50 day SMA thus warranting caution.  Patience will be required as stocks setup
5228 2018-02-21 04:09:30 Let’s start with the estate tax. Who gave the government the right to retax assets that has already been taxed?  Do you pay income tax on your saving account every year? How about your stocks?  They don’t deserve it and it may be unconstitutional (at least pre Roberts anyway)
5229 2018-02-21 04:09:21 @BWilliams I sincerely hope that members of congress will hear the cries of these children. @realDonaldTrump needs to sign and executive order banning all Semi-Auto & Bump Stocks. However, he will not stand up to the @NRA. Money is more important than the lives of our kids. #SAD.
5230 2018-02-21 04:09:20 @realDonaldTrump Disappointed in your new position on bump stocks. I was at NRAAM 2017 in Atlanta. I heard you vow to never infringe upon the second amendment. #NRA are on the wrong side of this as well.
5231 2018-02-21 04:09:18 #BanAssaultRifles He is only talking bump stocks because his owners at the #NRA gave him permission. That discussion was best held after the #VegasShooting. Bump stock was not a factor in #FloridaSchoolShooting. Smoke and mirrors as usual.
5232 2018-02-21 04:08:55 Bump stocks are waste of ammo, that shit aint cheap. Im sure there is a purpose for some, I just wont own one.
5233 2018-02-21 04:08:54 Don't b fooled by talk about bump stocks, that's  a very small bone to throw to a very big dog. Completely ban assault weapons would b a good 1st step
5234 2018-02-21 04:08:35 You're so stupid. Two separate times Obama authorized bump fire stocks! 2 times! So I guess you were here Obama was the reason behind the Las Vegas shooting.
5235 2018-02-21 04:08:32 I COULD CARE LESS FOR THE BUMP STOCKS, BUT IT IS JUST A STEP TO TAKEN AWAY OUR SCOND AMENDMENT. THIS IS THE OPENING FOR IT. TRUMP BEST TREAD SOFTLY ON OUR SECOND AMENDMENT OR HE WILL NOT GET VOTED BACK IN.
5236 2018-02-21 04:08:21 Agreed. But if fully-auto machine guns are illegal shouldn't bump-stocks...not that I'm an expert on the subject. Huge fan by the way.
5237 2018-02-21 04:08:12 Stop already.  You are the President of the United States. Who cares about ratings on CNN and MSNBC? Worry about how you’re going to impact #GunLawsNOW not just numb stocks.
5238 2018-02-21 04:08:11 Does that include his ban on bump stocks and "other automatic devices". It's a slippery slope and he is a FRAUD.
5239 2018-02-21 04:08:09 Wayne will be responsible for killing the NRA if he keeps cucking on things like bump stocks! #fuckwaynelacuck
5240 2018-02-21 04:07:57 Trump’s admonition to "ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns" faces a huge uphill battle.

Machine guns have had the same definition for 84 years. And there are no currently legal devices that do that. Not even bump stocks.
5241 2018-02-21 04:07:42 Read article how well anti smoking ads cut way down on teen smoking. Make NRA pay 4 them like tobacco com pd 4 theirs? Everthing helps! Test kindergartens  mental health & all again every 4 yrs & give GREAT treatment! Begin at the beginning! No bump stocks 
5242 2018-02-21 04:07:26 Take the issue away from the Dems..Question: Why  should  a 19 yr old be able to buy an Arsenal of guns? Answer... they shouldn’t! Banning bump stocks should be easy! Should have already happened. We are not giving up the 2nd but we can do some fine tuning! Let’s get it done. 
5243 2018-02-21 04:07:03 Mitt is gonna win Utah by 60 points. Trumps best bet was to extend an olive branch and hope he’s not a McCain. The ban of bump stocks is not an issue. At the least they should require a class 3 license.
5244 2018-02-21 04:06:57 I’m a gun person and I could care less. Bump stocks have zero sporting value. I’m all for precision and accuracy when shooting and a bump stock brings neither to the table.
5245 2018-02-21 04:06:11 MA's ban succeeded in getting four whole bump stocks off the street. 

Seriously. Only four people turned them in.
5246 2018-02-21 04:06:06 Absolutely ridiculous. Especially after Trump spoke with Sessions to ban bump stocks. Money speaks unfortunately
5247 2018-02-21 04:05:48 Bump stocks are useless. You can use your damn belt loop as a bump stock. Throw em a bone if it shuts ppl up.
5248 2018-02-21 04:05:32 Oh - but he ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stocks ... which they can’t do ... because HIS administration decided last year it had to be done by Congress!
5249 2018-02-21 04:05:17 @POTUS The same day you sign for ban of bump stocks, the Florida House votes no? Odd how all that worked out today.
5250 2018-02-21 04:05:05 No reason bump stocks should be legal. They intentionally were created to circumvent the law. This Trump supporter feels it's a wise choice.
5251 2018-02-21 04:05:03 Mr. President, looking to ban slide fire stocks is a mistake, and a terrible decision. Just because they were used by one man should not be the sole reason for banning them - and it's possibly dubious these stocks were even used.
5252 2018-02-21 04:04:55 I will not vote for Trump in 2020 thanks to him calling for the ban of bump stocks #LostMyVote #RIPTrump2020 #not1inch @realDonaldTrump
5253 2018-02-21 04:04:32 Actually it looks very good!! Retinal disease in my family.  Take 2 minutes and say a prayer of thanks and then write a story on biotech stocks and gene therapy!!!  And then  again for a cure.
5254 2018-02-21 04:04:25 I never would have thought Donald "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters" Trump would be the one to take action with the tiniest amount of gun control by banning bump stocks.
5255 2018-02-21 04:04:19 I should have bought stocks in Cottonelle.
5256 2018-02-21 04:04:17 I know you are talking about banning bump stocks. A bump stock wasn't involved when children & teachers were killed in Fla.. Do you think 17 dead kids is an 'acceptable' kill number so long as it's not 50 kids with a bump stock? Do you really think students will feel safer then?
5257 2018-02-21 04:03:40 Stocks can make you wait for many years and give returns of many years even in a single year. Like a stock which has not given any return in last 4 years and gets doubled in 5th year. You will be fetching 18% CAGR; which is quite good over the period of time.
5258 2018-02-21 04:03:37 Yep. It's a wimpy, half-assed attempt to get everyone off their backs while they pretend to care. Besides, they won't care if bump stocks get banned 'cuz they're not made by weapons makers who basically own NRA members because they love their damn weapons above all else.
5259 2018-02-21 04:03:36 How about FIXING existing background checks, Banning bump stocks even though it's not difficult to rig a field expedient one, and referring threats of online violence to a professional for evaluation? And fuck all holding anyone responsible for the actions of another.
5260 2018-02-21 04:03:35 Why are we banning bump stocks but not fixing NICS? The #maga movement just rang its first major death knell. Bump stocks had ZERO to do with the Florida shooting, so why do it? Anyone? This is how it starts. @GaetaSusan @ChrisLoesch
5261 2018-02-21 04:03:22 I'm not really a gun guy but my good friend who has been shooting his whole life says bump stocks are garbage and no one really wants one anyways.
5262 2018-02-21 04:02:58 Would be interesting to see HDFC AMC stance now - (HDFC mutual fund schemes like Prudence, Top 200, etc. has solid exposure to all PSU banking stocks - their star fund manager has been rather steadfast in his psu bank picks. ) Your views and comments welcome..
5263 2018-02-21 04:02:58 Bump stocks were already having trouble by design. It’s not a loss
5264 2018-02-21 04:02:55 States that does not allow the ban of bump stocks may not be helping matters, guns buying is like buying a pencil in the shop 
5265 2018-02-21 04:02:52 Why is Trump rolling over on his promise to uphold the 2nd amendment? The reason gun owners are up in arms about Trump outlawing bump stocks is because its a slippery sloap. You start banning things that increase fire, it can go into triggers, frames just about anything.
5266 2018-02-21 04:02:49 If they cared about bump stocks they'd had outlawed them already after Las Vegas.
5267 2018-02-21 04:02:34 Miguna Miguna on auction! Hurry! while stocks last!!!
5268 2018-02-21 04:02:27 And calling to ban bump stocks? Looks like i will be looking elsewhere in 2020
5269 2018-02-21 04:01:52 Ok so the USA hockey game is on CNBC (the channel with the screaming stocks guy). Channel 355 if you're a Big Baller like me who has DirecTV. #Olympics
5270 2018-02-21 04:01:50 I should have qualified that. If he was a good shot, more would be dead. He had a lot of time & ammo. And bump stocks are stupid. I think Trump is just giving Libs a bone. He knows law-abiding gun owners get the stupidity of this & the insignificance of them
5271 2018-02-21 04:01:41 Mr. Prez you were not elected to pass more gun control laws.  Bump stocks?!? Really??  They want to end 2A, they just won't admit it.
5272 2018-02-21 04:01:35 You have to be the most tone deaf president this country has ever seen. Want to make a difference: ban all assault weapons nationwide; make background checks mandatory;  no gun sales to anyone younger than 21; ban bump stocks; make parents lock their guns up.That would be a start
5273 2018-02-21 04:01:30 You don't actually believe Trump's actually going to do anything about bump stocks? This is a diversion.
5274 2018-02-21 04:01:26 I don't really care if they ban bump stocks. It's kind of a dumb accessory.

But let's not pretend banning something any moron w/ a pile of scrap wood and some basic tools could build is an effective deterrent for mass shootings.
5275 2018-02-21 04:01:03 Bump stocks have been illegal in California since 1990.
Why don't you ask us how we did it, Mr @POTUS?
You'll need a law/can't do it with regs alone.
Massachusetts and New Jersey also outlawed them post-LV.
Other states should also look as you'll get state action faster.
5276 2018-02-21 04:00:56 Trump announced today he's banning bump stocks.  These kids just hit one from beyond the arc.
5277 2018-02-21 04:00:47 #45 move to ban bump stocks which makes it easier to fire more round quickly ... Welcomed development #saysomething 
5278 2018-02-21 04:00:42 @GOP and @POTUS Banning bump stocks but ALSO assault rifles would be great but only one part of an effective solution. Kids in school MUST be protected better. One entry into school, metal detectors & armed guards would stop most if not all sick or evil people from attacking!
5279 2018-02-21 04:00:39 Thanks for the thoughtful replies, appreciate the real conversation. Outside of the #2A argument, how do you feel about restricting bump stocks?
5280 2018-02-21 04:00:37 If people want to belt-loop bump fire, go nuts, but these stocks are just a work-around the law. Probably should have been banned as soon as they were invented. I feel like they're just for feeling like Rambo for a few fleeting seconds. This is as far as I'd cave, ever.

5283 2018-02-21 03:59:39 Feinstein torpedoed her own bill after vegas because she went too far. The NRA almost agreed on looking up on the bump stock issue and she came in with a bill that prohibited any gun mods instead of just bump stocks. Gun ownerz cant trust the person who started the assault ban.
5284 2018-02-21 03:59:25 Ridiculous lack of any care or management of our Wild Salmon stocks!!!
5285 2018-02-21 03:59:09 Taking stocks at 12% is downright silly, thanks hydro pump.
5286 2018-02-21 03:58:57 A. The story is about background checks.
B. They actually do discuss bump stocks right in the middle of the article.
C.  Next time you may want to read (not just skim) before commenting.
5287 2018-02-21 03:58:56 $MON OWn Philip Morris and other sins stocks but even if I knew this would make me a billionaire I wouldn’t buy this stock. Devil incarnate
5288 2018-02-21 03:58:49 Ruth Marcus (Washington Post columnist) just dismissed bump stocks ban on LO'D show as too little, too ineffective (DOJ can't do it unilaterally anyway) and if you really wanted to do something, you would do it through legislation.
5289 2018-02-21 03:58:42 EO addressing BUMP STOCKS is smoke and mirrors. @realDonaldTrump is only talking about it because #NRA said he could. Bump stocks were not used in #FloridaSchoolShooting. @ananavarro @donlemon
5290 2018-02-21 03:58:39 I am a responsible gun owner and NRA member. We are people, not a for-profit organization. Don’t care about bump stocks. Ok with background checks. But if you want IRS or DMV types deciding who can have a gun, forget it.
5291 2018-02-21 03:58:39 Banning bump stocks will have little or no practical result. Trump and the GOP thinks that giving an inch will be sufficient. We won't stop until we take a mile.
5292 2018-02-21 03:58:15 Careful what you wish for. Russia and North Korea have vats of the stuff. It only takes a scab about the size of your thumb nail to kill billions. We have stocks too.
5293 2018-02-21 03:58:05 Bump stocks are not arms and can be made illegal.   But to what effect? The same result can be achieved with rubberbands on the trigger and trigger guard!  My point is we can not legislate our way out of this evil.  We must turn to GOD!
5294 2018-02-21 03:57:14 Also not talked about is how shitty bump stocks are. Most "gun" people hate them. They make the gun fire wildly and very inaccurately. They only worked in Vegas because he was shooting into a large, densely packed crowd.
5295 2018-02-21 03:57:06 @IselaBlancAZ Where were you on the bump stocks vote today? HB2023. You are my representative. Why didn’t you vote?
5296 2018-02-21 03:57:04 OK
5297 2018-02-21 03:56:44 Doesn’t mention the AR 15 does he? Of course not. Bump stocks should have been banned after Las Vegas. What took him so long? Needs to show he’s doing something but your right Lawrence, he has no thoughts of his own. The mans too stupid. RESIGN !!!
5298 2018-02-21 03:56:34 Trump announced today he's banning bump stocks, though. He was dragging his feet on this forever.  If it wasn't these outspoken students that put pressure on him, what was it?
5299 2018-02-21 03:56:22 Thoughts and prayers to you for your huge loss of target shooting without bump stocks. 
5300 2018-02-21 03:56:19 We need to ban assault weapons and bump stocks, limit high-capacity magazines, and strengthen background checks and waiting periods. We also need to fund mental healthcare adequately. People are finally rising up and saying that enough is enough. #NeverAgain
5301 2018-02-21 03:56:17 @cnn @SymoneDSanders : “A step in the right direction” on Trump’s call for background checks and ban on bump stocks. #guncontrol 
5302 2018-02-21 03:56:09 Hmm I rarely see this in physical bookstores though. At least in SG, not sure about the stocks in MY. Maybe you can try Bookdepository? They almost always have every title to ever exist
5303 2018-02-21 03:55:48 I’m not sure bump stocks are really an issue of gun control! What worries me is how far this could go.
5304 2018-02-21 03:55:37 Agreed.  Eliminate the bump stocks and get the minimum age for firearm purchase to 21 nationwide.  I think they could get bipartisan support for these.
5305 2018-02-21 03:55:35 Reports say Trump’s told DOJ to look into creating regulations to prohibit sale of “bump stocks.” DON’T BELIEVE IT! Trump & GOP have no intention of pursuing real gun control. It’s a PR move; a cheap distraction from their indifference to carnage & killing. @heffnera #NRA @NPR
5306 2018-02-21 03:55:03 What good is Banning bump stocks when you still will have the AR-15 assault weapon that's an insult to everybody's intelligence !
5307 2018-02-21 03:54:44 Guess it's a good thing assault rifles were banned in '86 along with all the other automatic weapons, that's one item already taken care of. #aheadofthegame Seriously though, aside from most of #3 I'm on board with this. Bump stocks can go though they violate the '86 ban anyway.
5308 2018-02-21 03:54:39 I don’t understand why banning bump stocks is an issue. Like no one is supposed to have automatic weapons
5309 2018-02-21 03:54:21 Obviously you missed this after VEGAS?  The ATF has already said the justice dept does not have jurisdiction & if they want bump stocks banned a law needs to pass congress.
5310 2018-02-21 03:54:05 Evidence @realDonaldTrump doesn’t get anything done ...
The DOJ started looking into the legality of bump stocks in December. The Vegas shooting happened on October 1st.
5311 2018-02-21 03:54:04 Of course. They want to deflect from that with the bump stocks idea.
5312 2018-02-21 03:54:01 It's almost like Trump doesn't actually want bump stocks banned but just wanted people to get off his back and to have something to boast about when he meets with MSD High survivors. Assuming he goes through with that meeting.
5313 2018-02-21 03:53:48 yeah. he agrees. He's wrong. Bump stocks are not an illegal modification, which is what he wants investigated. Nor does it turn a semi-automatic into a full auto. In either case, if you want to fix gun crime, start at the source, the people pulling the trigger.
5314 2018-02-21 03:53:48 @RAZ0RFIST what dost thou think of the emperor putting up a ban on bump stocks?
5315 2018-02-21 03:53:43 Tramp can't ban bump stocks by directing DOJ  that has to go through CONGRESS  so his mouthing as usual is just fodder for those that don't know the laws , limits, rules , etc on how government works.
5316 2018-02-21 03:53:21 Nobody wants to take your shotgun. Background checks, semi-automatics, bump stocks and raising the age to 21 to buy weapons are the issues on the table. I just watched it on PBS. Parkland students are riding busses to talk. Don't worry, the NRA gave Trump $30M Nothing will happen
5317 2018-02-21 03:53:20 Hey! @CNN @MSNBC @maddow  - Don't get too excited that my man @realDonaldTrump mentioned banning Bump Stocks.  He thinks Bump Stocks are something you buy from your broker... #POTUS #MAGA
5318 2018-02-21 03:53:05 Hell no I've got 6 guns molon labe I'm just saying what's true. I realize the Ar and.bump stocks are mere useful tools for Marxism  confisca
5319 2018-02-21 03:53:00 2. Reach agreement on the kinds of guns that are not "needs." AR-15s and similar weapons should be a start. What else is out there? Bump stocks and devices that convert weapons to automatic or semi-automatic. Magazine sizes should also be an issue.
5320 2018-02-21 03:52:59 @scrowder @NotGayJared Theory: Liberals hate Trump so much that he’s making the concession on bump stocks and they’ll *still* complain against what he’s doing!
5321 2018-02-21 03:52:50 Let’s get the year straight. Nasdaq peak =March 10, 2000.  In 1999 stocks were rising so furiously that many were splitting every couple of months. Me thinks bottom is not in until the SEC makes a definitive reg on ICOs/tether. Only then will we get back on the semi-log plot.

Pound V euro: GBP slides as UK retail sales miss…
5323 2018-02-21 03:52:10 I was actually against bump stocks, before I was for them.
5324 2018-02-21 03:51:59 Wade, ICYMI, the NRA already agreed to support banning of bump stocks right after Vegas massacre & nothing/no one moved on it! Now POTUS is coming out saying he supports banning of bump stocks like he thought of it! Continue to fight! 
5325 2018-02-21 03:51:27 The professional soldier in me really can not get excited about this. Unless you are wanting to spray a big crowd at close range. Bump Stocks ruin the tactical advantage of an AR style weapon.
5326 2018-02-21 03:51:27 There is a coup going on against him and all Trump can do is give into the menstrual hysterics of the communists and ban bump stocks? These people want you and everyone who voted you into office dead.  Where is the fucking wall? Compromise with these people is no deal at all!
5327 2018-02-21 03:51:23 Five months after the LA shooting, Trump wants to ban "bump stocks" at the heels of another tragedy. i.e. to do what he should have done months ago, but only doing now in a desperate NRA backed effort to take pressure off more serious gun reforms. #FloridaShooting #guncontrol
5328 2018-02-21 03:51:00 Great. It's now a garage project for US to duplicate. So stupid.
Bump stocks are easy.
Garage project.
Are you guys stupid?
5329 2018-02-21 03:50:49 Don Bacon. Our Representative, proud to lead from behind. Oh, NRA not opposed. Also A.F.T. Isn’t sure it has the authority to ban bump stocks w/o additional legislation. So, thanks for the smoke screen.

5331 2018-02-21 03:50:10 @POTUS Bump stocks do not make semiautomatic rifles machine guns.
They do make a higher volume of fire possible, so perhaps availability should be moved by Congress to NFA.
National carry reciprocity & suppressors removed from NFA need to be enacted.
5332 2018-02-21 03:50:01 As I read the memo and even the speech, he and it nowhere say that bump stocks do turn guns into machine guns, just that he wants clarification on whether they do and wants to ban parts that do so.
5333 2018-02-21 03:49:55 So there are several aftermarket mods that are banned. And Trump was just saying today he wants to ban bump stocks. And aren’t there already restrictions on magazine capacity in several states, as well as certain kinds of ammo?
5334 2018-02-21 03:49:27 @realDonaldTrump Sir, thank you for asking AG to ban bump stocks. It's a start.
5335 2018-02-21 03:49:23 After bump stocks will be clips, #Guaranteed
5336 2018-02-21 03:49:08 HAHAHHA! I'm ok with that "cave" -  because bump stocks suck.  It's a good way to waste ammo fast. Accuracy goes in the toilet.  Bump stocks are worthless - and if he's going to ban something to shut the liberals up, that's a good thing to do away with.
5337 2018-02-21 03:48:59 Want to get closer to 50% approval @realDonaldTrump? Show some backbone and be true to your real beliefs. Common sense gun control. Beyond bump stocks. All guns 21+, universal background checks, admit your mistake on mental health gun buys in Feb.
5338 2018-02-21 03:48:49 A semi-automatic rifle that can be upgraded to an automatic weapon using accessories such as bump stocks easily. Also the most popular weapon used among mass shooters. ALSO something people like Cruz can STILL obtain legally and easily with our current gun laws.
5339 2018-02-21 03:48:32 guns dont kill people, bump stocks do.... (apparently)
5340 2018-02-21 03:48:27 NOT TO MENTION the ridiculous idea of bump stocks & high capacity magazines. All must be stopped sale of immediately. We must get serious about moving forward on single payer healthcare. It is absolutely imperative to society's mental health! There are many ideas on the table.
5341 2018-02-21 03:48:06 Because without bump stocks, this would never have happened, right? Oh wait, never mind. It would have. And it will happen again until we decide to protect schools with armed guards and armed teachers.
5342 2018-02-21 03:47:50 I get the distinction.  Just questioning whether one mans ability to bump fire should have any bearing on the debate.  And I disagree with you in the Vegas thing.  Sure, accuracy is decreased with bump stocks.   But he wasn’t concerned with accuracy.  Just amount of lead thrown.
5343 2018-02-21 03:47:36 Not high capacity semi and full autos or bump stocks there weren't. Your pickup window audience is rubbish.
5344 2018-02-21 03:47:23 He said he would outlaw bump stocks after Vegas shooting. What’s the holdup? The govt needs to combine it with a buyback program, to take them off the streets. #MomsDemandAction #EveryTown #GunReformNow
5345 2018-02-21 03:47:18 Hi Izzal, this promotion is while stocks last. Thank you.
5346 2018-02-21 03:47:16 @SpeakerRyan After Las Vegas, you promised action on bump stocks, saying they were clearly designed to circumvent federal firearms laws. It's been 141 days. #whereisthebill
5347 2018-02-21 03:47:08 It’s shameful that a ban on bump-stocks wasn’t passed within a day of the Vegas shooting.
5348 2018-02-21 03:47:07 Bump stocks work I've seen it I guarantee it will take out multiple targets in 10 seconds fire rate not as fast as full.military M4
5349 2018-02-21 03:47:01 NRA wanted to "trade" a bump-stock ban in exchange for universal concealed-carry reciprocity among States.

The latter might still be a good idea. But banning bump stocks may not be so easy. They simply don’t meet the 84-year-old definition of a "machine gun".

5351 2018-02-21 03:46:56 Agreed. So why is there a 180-day review ongoing for bump stocks?
5352 2018-02-21 03:46:52 Educate yourself...go watch YouTube on bump stocks and rubber bands...this is going down the same path as the war on drugs...it didn't work either.
5353 2018-02-21 03:46:50 I have yet to ever hear an effective catch all solution ,but the enhanced gun control will definitely not do it .After Vegas ,the cry was "Ban Bump stocks"!.Well,if we banned them,would it have stopped this tragedy,No ,of course not!
5354 2018-02-21 03:46:44 I'm like a lot of gun owners, never heard of # Bump Stocks until all this Crap came up, all the guns I ever bought have ORGINAL Stocks ,as for as Back- Ground CKS they know if I ever got a parking ticket within minutes! !

5359 2018-02-21 03:46:01 Let’s keep gun parts out of the conversation, and deal with the bigger issues, gun free zones, and mental health epidemic. Banning such “ bump stocks “ will not fix any future tragedies. Mr. President, keep your promise, protect our constitution.
5360 2018-02-21 03:46:01 Gun stocks are parts of guns just like when you ban fully automatic tigger mechanisms, they aren’t “guns”, but they are part of a “gun”, they are the trigger mechanism.
5361 2018-02-21 03:45:51 @realDonaldTrump  Where is the Real You?  You Now want to give Amnesty to Illegals, you are amping up the War in Afghanistan and today you are going for banning bump stocks?   You ran on the OPPOSITE to All those issues.  Who is getting to you>?? BUILD THE WALL!
5362 2018-02-21 03:45:50 Don't forget "we're looking into banning bump stocks". It's a newer talking point, but it's already gaining traction.
5363 2018-02-21 03:45:44 If you are serious, then you MUST attach a medical history to the application. They MUST agree to ALL medical records being released or NO GUN. AND, ban all assault weapons, bump stocks, magazines etc for everyday people. IT MUST BE DONE! PLEASE THINK LIKE A DAD & NOT A PRESIDENT
5364 2018-02-21 03:45:40 I don't know....make laws?

As places to start:
Close gun show loopholes.
Waiting periods. 
Ban bump stocks and other aftermarket mods.
Ban high capacity mags.
Ban certain military grade ammo.
Treat gun violence like the epidemic it is, let the CDC study it.
5365 2018-02-21 03:45:17 What are you talking about? Limiting bump stocks was already endorsed by the NRA.

5370 2018-02-21 03:44:51 People will find any reason to shit on Trump; the ban on bump stocks and the like is a GOOD thing. Yes there is more work to be done, but damn people.
5371 2018-02-21 03:44:50 Um, no. Who manufactures bump stocks?
5372 2018-02-21 03:44:36 @realDonaldTrump what the hell ban  on  bump stocks it’s not the gun it’s the mental dems don’t go against your word this was Fbi  fault have security at schools not at the coward congress and senate and why is obama care not cancelled and why are illegals still in this country
5373 2018-02-21 03:44:34 If true, it's a meaningless token gesture, since bump stocks are not needed to bump-fire a gun.
5374 2018-02-21 03:44:20 You will find, just like Obama did, without actually changing the law the ATF cannot ban bump stocks. BTW anyonw with a good gun should not ruin the barrel with a bump stock!
5375 2018-02-21 03:44:10 Full autos are not illegal in all states. Bump stocks make firing highly inaccurate. Vegas shooter would’ve killed more without them. They do not make a semi-auto into a full auto.
5376 2018-02-21 03:43:55 And no gun sales to mentally ill, no sales to under 21, no bump stocks, no assault rifles, national buy back AND quit taking big $$$ from NRA!
5377 2018-02-21 03:43:49 @realDonaldTrump   I haven't supported a single thing that you have done so far during your presidency but thank you for at least doing something to hopefully regulate bump stocks.

5392 2018-02-21 03:41:58 Dave Attell talked stocks, bitcoin, “corrections”, “down markets”... I was kinda caught off guard!
5393 2018-02-21 03:41:46 IT INFRINGES ON MY RIGHTS AS A GUN OWNER.  BACKGROUND CHECKS WE HAVE.  WE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.   IF NO ONE ENFORCES OUR EXISTING LAWS, WHAT GOOD ARE THEY?  AND NO OTHER RESTRICTIONS BESIDES BUMP STOCKS. 
5394 2018-02-21 03:41:41 Bump stocks are the spinning hubcaps of the gun world. I think they’re a joke / novelty but the problem is that it leads us down a slippery slope and opens doors for other bans / “compromises” where we will feel the sting as law abiding gun owners.
5395 2018-02-21 03:40:29 Thanks big bro , stocks on the rise 
5396 2018-02-21 03:39:43 Is Trump really going to risk it all, lose NRA support, over bump stocks of all things???  Why strengthen something that doesn't work?  Sounds like a Dem... it doesn't work, so let's throw more $$ at it and then it will work!
5397 2018-02-21 03:39:41 A ban on bump stocks would be nice, but it doesn’t even touch the problem. We need much stronger gun control laws. I’d support a law under which all sales are regulated, and all guns are registered. No more loopholes.
5398 2018-02-21 03:39:27 I'm an Olympic Rifle coach and could care less about bump stocks and other Walter Mitty gimmicks.  I only want to see a good tradeoff for the concession, as our opponents aren't exactly operating in good faith.
5399 2018-02-21 03:39:03 I say if we must have guns, let them have muskets, and no more. That is what the constitutionalist had. All automatic, semi automatic and block stocks should be banned! I’m with the kids!
5400 2018-02-21 03:39:01 Please correct headline. US President Donald Trump backs same ban on 'bump  stocks' that NRA backs.
5401 2018-02-21 03:38:43 I've been learning about stocks and reading about how to invest so I will never go broke. 
5402 2018-02-21 03:38:26 I agree, ban the bump stocks if it makes Libs feel better. Never heard of them til Las Vegas. Waste of ammunition anyway.
5403 2018-02-21 03:38:25 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks is going to do nothing to confront someone that's hell bent on committing evil. Violent people need to be met with violence that's the only way you can deal with them.
5404 2018-02-21 03:38:23 Like 90% Canadian Pot Stocks and I just bought my first domestic pot stocks today lol. I’ve been trying to practice w BitCoin and crypto currencies but that shits on a whole other level. You trade? 
5405 2018-02-21 03:38:19 I think this is all part of a master plan response to Remington declaring bankruptcy to get arms makers' stocks back up.
5406 2018-02-21 03:38:16 He can support banning bump stocks several different ways, not just your bill Dianne.
5407 2018-02-21 03:38:13 As I figured, you have a conspiracy. You are quoting articles which were printed before it was determined what guns were used (AR-15s with bump stocks). With Trumpers, its ALWAYS a stupid conspiracy. You think he didnt use the AR-15s but a super secret machine gun, correct?
5408 2018-02-21 03:37:50 @IngrahamAngle The question going forward is what else will Trump ban to appease anti-gun groups ?. A bunch of school kids with support from George Sorros & leftist women's groups scared him to order ban on bump stocks. The next incident could lead him to ban other guns.

5412 2018-02-21 03:36:37 Twitter: “Trump needs to do something about guns” 

Trump: *pushes congress to ban bump stocks and other gun mods*

Twitter “Well there were no bump stocks in the parkland shooting”

There was in the LA shooting, do those deaths not matter? He did what you asked. Can u be happy?
5413 2018-02-21 03:36:20 Yeah I don't think banning bump stocks is in itself government tyranny.
5414 2018-02-21 03:36:16 I don't even find this surprising or effective, even if bump stocks are banned there are other ways to simulate the system that probably doesn't even require modifications to the gun. Its going to be just another pointless law that does nothing but punish law abiding citizens.
5415 2018-02-21 03:36:14  ...and???  Are any of them being indicted?!  Just MUTT ROMNEY & now bump stocks!  Clinton,Soros,Obama &his administration,Alphabet agencies targeting citizens?!!! Any JUSTICE?!

5417 2018-02-21 03:35:54 What isn't "the economy"? Consumer optimism made this place boom. The DOW isn't a direct reflection of the economy. Rumors can crash it as it did when rumors of feds raising interest rates caused software dumping of stocks to tumble. It was just talk. Economy is growing fast.
5418 2018-02-21 03:35:47 Shame on Trump for refusing to discuss bump-stocks immediately following the Vegas shooting months ago.
He put people's lives at risk.
5419 2018-02-21 03:35:44 That means these kids are getting through. If #Trump #NRA #GOP think move to ban "bump stocks" going to end this they're badly mistaken. The horrors of Trumpers will spread the worst, majority of country won't believe them.
5420 2018-02-21 03:35:32 Take a look at what the AR can do with different bullets. Who needs bump stocks or sticks. Major damage.
5421 2018-02-21 03:35:01 @realDonaldTrump the @ATFHQ has alre publicly stated, "under current Congressional law, bump stocks are legal because the modification does not meet the definition of machine gun." You are either stupid or know already this will have ZERO IMPACT. @maddow
5422 2018-02-21 03:34:37 Lack of morals, lack of discipline, and a lack of respect for other people’s lives and property is the problem with people today. Ban bump stocks all you want, won’t change a thing.
5423 2018-02-21 03:34:32 Bump stocks weren’t a factor in any large scale shooting that I’m aware of before LV. I never even heard of them before LV.
5424 2018-02-21 03:34:31 School shooting>too soon>mental health>execute!> need... More guns! weaponize police, Principals, teachers, Security guards, ICE in the schools> only way to stop a bullet is an infinate number of bullers going the other way>let's talk bump stocks>those dreamers are cute huh?
5425 2018-02-21 03:34:22 Laura, you really gotta lighten up on the man. It’s bump stocks, not the 2nd Amendment. Cut him some friggin’ slack. In the meantime, listening to more Mike Gallagher in the AM.
5426 2018-02-21 03:34:14 We already know - bump stocks. A little too little, too late. The kids who want to live are coming.
5427 2018-02-21 03:34:08 Trump banning bump stocks will probably work just as well as posting a sign that states “gun free zone.” Does he think criminals actually follow the law?
5428 2018-02-21 03:34:07 Very disappointed in @realDonaldTrump by his comments regarding bump stocks, firearms, and his directive to infringe upon our second amendment. It seems he has quickly forgotten the people who put him there and the rights he was put there to protect.
5429 2018-02-21 03:34:01 I've not heard anyone say "take away all the guns". 
I have heard: background checks, ban people w mental illness/on federal watch lists from owning guns, ban bump stocks, reapprove the federal assault weapons ban, educate people on safe gun use/storage.  #GunSense
5430 2018-02-21 03:33:51 We'll see. It would be nice to have him do something like a President. But, the test will be down the road, will he sign legislation to ban bump stocks?
5431 2018-02-21 03:33:45 @realDonaldTrump you promised to do away with gun free zones & didn’t now you’re going after our guns. You’re going to lose my vote and millions of others. When guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns so even tho I don’t have them criminals will still get bump stocks
5432 2018-02-21 03:33:41 So do we all do a shot of tequila when Jeff Sessions declares bump stocks as being legal?  Or maybe a bong hit 
5433 2018-02-21 03:33:38 Trump, apparently wants to ban bump stocks. That’s a start. Better background checks. FBI following leads. We have a lot of room to grow on without all the hatred. Btw liked your bio till towards the end. Good talking to ya. Gig em!
5434 2018-02-21 03:33:31 #1 ED I am said: America don't be fooled Ban on bunt stocks was already in affect nothing done But did you know JR Trump & NRA Tried to pass
5435 2018-02-21 03:33:30 You recently tweeted to ban devices that make rifles into machine guns. Dumbass bump stocks increase the rate of fire but DO NOT turn it into a machine gun. Tgat fucks us as a trigger job could be said to increase the rate of fire while smoothing it out. Think before you act!
5436 2018-02-21 03:33:21 I am beyond disgusted that democrats could pass Obamacare with no republican votes but not gun control. Banning bump stocks and AR15s should have been East for Dems.
5437 2018-02-21 03:33:00 There w/be 2 types of liberals that have 2 different inputs on the presidents recent band on bump stocks..

1 group will say its a major win and the other will say its still not good enough. 

What both groups will never understand is that guns w/still shoot w/out a bump stock
5438 2018-02-21 03:32:47 @IngrahamAngle 
Listening to your gun discussion. Republicans need to give on bum stocks. The hard line approach is cornering the party and creating a perception of not caring. Get out of the box, nobody needs a bum stock.
5439 2018-02-21 03:32:47 I have friends who have.bump stocks and I've watched them live fire on targets I was amazed at the rate of fire and the controlled accuracy

5443 2018-02-21 03:32:07 @realDonaldTrump.  Bump stocks were NOT used in Law Vegas.  They were fully automatic belt fed weapons.  We need to enforce the existing laws effectively before we decide to add more laws.  @TomiLahren @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @cspan
5444 2018-02-21 03:31:53 This is Bullshit.  Anyone following gun trends knows the new slide sticks have replaced the Bump stocks and this is ineffective rhetoric.
5445 2018-02-21 03:31:38 Nigga he wants to Ban Bump stocks i'm done
5446 2018-02-21 03:31:35 That's it, bump stocks, really?  Ban guns that were meant for the military and war. Moron
5447 2018-02-21 03:31:30 They're legal.

ATF has already informed congress that they do not have the ability to regulate Bump Stocks.
5448 2018-02-21 03:31:28 I stand with the kids, the survivors, the real adults that love life. I stand against the NRA and those that think their wants are more important than they needs of the many. Assault weapons ban needs to be reinstated, bump stocks are not enough. It's time to STAND, #NoNRAMoney
5449 2018-02-21 03:31:18 Trump’s calling the justice department to ban weapon mods like bump stocks and the internet doesn't know who to be mad at.
5450 2018-02-21 03:31:10 Me neither! Now the only people who can get bump stocks are criminals, terrorists, Muslims and Trump/America hating Democrats. Hey, and, by the way, most if not all, of these mass murderers are/were registered Democrats or leaned that way.
5451 2018-02-21 03:31:07 Cool. So when are you getting your drones? Do you know if Walmart stocks any?
5452 2018-02-21 03:31:04 For today – Nifty now has a strong resistance at 10430-50.

5454 2018-02-21 03:30:43 Dear liberals, sell your stocks and wait 2-5 years to buy again. Let conservatives hold the bag. Weak president equals weal nation. I’m selling tomorrow. Every last account. Cash is king when the leader is a clown
5455 2018-02-21 03:30:33 @IngrahamAngle The "bump stocks" are only a symptom of the violent actions occurring in America. We can't legislate sanity or common sense.
5456 2018-02-21 03:30:26 @SenDeanHeller Pres Trump wants bump stocks made illegal and background checks.. support this. lead this in NV
5457 2018-02-21 03:30:19 Bump stocks should never have been approved; the only reason the Obama BATFE approved them was that they were hoping for a mass shooting. They prevent the shooter from exercising positive control over the operation of the weapon.
5458 2018-02-21 03:30:17 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS banning bump stocks won't be enough. They will demand more. They always want more.
5459 2018-02-21 03:30:04 The kind of bump stocks available now are just tubes connected to the pistol grip, the shooter applies forward tension on the front of the gun to pull it into his finger. Since no mechanical force is exerted its not a machine gun. Its the same as a gatling gun.
5460 2018-02-21 03:30:02 @IngrahamAngle Trump betrayed his base again by banning Bump stocks. He surrendered to the anti-gun lobby to make himself look good though most gun owners with bump stocks haven't harmed anyone. Next he could ban AR15 or high capacity magazines.
5461 2018-02-21 03:30:00 Bump stocks are not firearms. Ergo, not subject to 2nd amendment protection.
5462 2018-02-21 03:29:57 Love to read all these strategists! Low & falling yields bullish for stocks bc of valuation. Rising yields perfectly normal & healthy signaling growth. Flattening curve spells no danger. Steepening curve signals strong growth prospects! Everything always bullish! 
5463 2018-02-21 03:29:57 I know let’s widen the gun free zone around schools and get rid of bump stocks and beg criminals not to break those laws.
5464 2018-02-21 03:29:47 Indeed. Because 30 years ago when this guy was in high school, people didn’t have AR-15s. Bump stocks. Or extended magazines. So yeah, it is a gun problem.
5465 2018-02-21 03:29:39 I’ll believe this when they have the executive order signed and bump stocks are no longer available.
5466 2018-02-21 03:29:30 @realDonaldTrump Don’t cave to the gun control. Banning bump stocks, solves nothing. Make gun free zones extinct. That’s the only thing that has a chance to work. Good guys with guns, saves lives. Banning bump stocks does not.
5467 2018-02-21 03:29:30 Before Las Vegas no one knew "bump stocks" existed 
5468 2018-02-21 03:29:14 Eliminate bump stocks and AR 15s.
5469 2018-02-21 03:29:09 President Trump has moved to attempt to ban bump stocks...I know this is not the solution, but hopefully it will open a door to a bipartisan effort...fyi, I am a conservative who favors more strict gun laws.
5470 2018-02-21 03:28:57 He is wanting to ban bump stocks. A start but a lot more needs to be done! He has yet to call for any other action. MARCH ON MARCH 24! UNTIL ALL SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ARE ILLEGAL!
5471 2018-02-21 03:28:43 Exactly. Those fuckers know we're at a breaking point..."give 'em bump stocks." Nope. We are coming for a huge change...we will get it!
5472 2018-02-21 03:28:32 Buy your Bump fire stocks while they are cheap. I don't like em but I know they'll be worth double in the coming months. lol
5473 2018-02-21 03:28:28 I don't agree with the bump stock ban, but I can see why he would do it. He's taking hard hits and probably feeling bad about the kids that were killed. It's his compromise. Bump stocks aren't useful, so I can live with this one.
5474 2018-02-21 03:28:20 ...where bump stocks weren't an issue.  But in Florida you can get an AR-15 before you can buy booze! Pretty crazy, right?
5475 2018-02-21 03:28:04 I’m the most against #bumpstocks. I’ve always been. Many people have said, you’re the most against bump stocks that we’ve ever seen — far more than Democrats let me tell you. Too bad FAKE NEWS failing media would never tell you that. Sad!
5476 2018-02-21 03:28:01 Um, ar 15s do NOT fit the definition of an assault weapon. I know they look scary senator, but stop feeding bullshit to the sheep. One trigger pull, one bullet. Like a pistol.  Want to go after bump stocks? Better bkgnd checks? Be my guest
5477 2018-02-21 03:27:59 Bump stocks are not mechanical devices, bump stocks in the past actually were banned because the stock included a spring which pushed the gun forward into the shooters trigger finger, since a spring is by definition a type of simple machine, these were denied ATF approval.

5479 2018-02-21 03:27:44 I applaud President Trump banning bump stocks. For Trumpists though I want to point out that...Trump is coming for your guns.
5480 2018-02-21 03:27:44 I thought he responded with a round of golf. The senate and congress make laws, they are the ones who will have to ban bump stocks (they won't). A memo is just for show, it is meaningless, much like your opinion.
5481 2018-02-21 03:27:33 I happen to think he's being politically smart about the bump stocks, but I'm just an imbecile.
5482 2018-02-21 03:27:28 A stock dont follow a big investor. buying / selling stocks based on their position is nt a good idea. Eg: A big invstr bot krbl at 20rs and exited at 100rs for 5x returns. In next 2 - 3 yrs the stock surged to almost 675 rs, more than 5x frm the sale..
5483 2018-02-21 03:27:14 Where there is a will there is a way.  Bump stocks don't matter, but let's pretend they do.
5484 2018-02-21 03:27:12 Nifty Technical View: Closing at the levels of 10360 which is well below the support levels and overall pattern being bearish, the fall can take Nifty to 10280-10075. Nifty took support with Fibonacci levels at 23.60%, which is 10338.

5485 2018-02-21 03:27:08 Um, bump stocks?
5486 2018-02-21 03:26:42 Trying to ban bump stocks is probably the only sane thing that moron has done so far.
5487 2018-02-21 03:26:41 .@IngrahamAngle If you give the left an inch they’ll take a mile. Today it’s bump stocks tomorrow they’ll move to something else. Never satisfied and not honest players. #IngrahamAngle
5488 2018-02-21 03:26:40 It is not the President's job to create laws. That falls on Congress. He has just instructed the AG's office in a memo to look into steps necessary to ban bump stocks and all devices like them. I got home five minutes ago and have this info already. Where do you get news from?
5489 2018-02-21 03:26:39 I'm curious as to what Sean Hannity and Bill Mitchell have to say about Trump directing Sessions to try an ban bump stocks? We all know what they're reaction would've been if Obama did this
5490 2018-02-21 03:26:38 @nra if @realDonaldTrump bans bump stocks we will be going down a road with presidential gun mandate control. @nra thanks for #surrendering
5491 2018-02-21 03:26:15 need to diversify my stocks :L
5492 2018-02-21 03:26:08 @IngrahamAngle First guest incorrect information. The vegas shooter had 20 Bump stocks not a single firearm.
5493 2018-02-21 03:26:00 Sir holding bank of maharastra 1000 stocks @ 23 rs what to do???
5494 2018-02-21 03:25:54 @realDonaldTrump you are wrong about Bump Stocks. 2nd Amendment is about the people being able to resist an out-of-control government. Why would you reduce the firepower of patriots who may be the last chance of the free Nation?
5495 2018-02-21 03:25:49 Obama had a chance to ban bump stocks and didn't do it but of course he's a hero. #IngrahamAngle
5496 2018-02-21 03:25:32 There are also collectors. Some like differant configurations based on application. Its a semi automatic weapon. One trigger pull one bullet, except in the exception of bump stocks. Thats an add on, not standard equipment. I would never own a bump stock. Ammo isnt cheap.
5497 2018-02-21 03:25:24 He isnt banning anything, he is looking into it. He could just "art of the deal" and have congress pass a law tomorrow to ban bump stocks
Also, I could only imagine you freaking out if Obama said it, hell you zealots freaked for 8 yrs Obama coming for guns when he did nothing
5498 2018-02-21 03:25:08 OIC Dotard now wants restrictions on bump-stocks.What a wonderful man!
5499 2018-02-21 03:25:02 Don’t know if I want to go back to stocks or do 6s 
5500 2018-02-21 03:24:55 True, but the same could be said for so-called cheap stocks with low P/E’s. Many are dying businesses with no real future earning power, making their stocks actually overvalued. Hard to find compounders that are undervalued, also hard to find cheap stocks that are actually cheap
5501 2018-02-21 03:24:52 Banning bump stocks is a start.
5502 2018-02-21 03:24:51 We are just nibbling around the edge of gun violence because those are the terms that are dictated to us by Big Ammo. So we talk mental health checks, and bump stocks, and how we can get fewer toddlers to shoot themselves in the head.
5503 2018-02-21 03:24:31 I'm not an advocate for bump stocks since it's a waste of bullets for a cheap thrill but it still doesn't solve anything.
5504 2018-02-21 03:24:27 Spoiler alert: It’s bump stocks. Now please don’t watch the show.
5505 2018-02-21 03:24:22 Banning bump stocks is a very small step! The assault weapons ban needs to be reinstated Nation wide! Kids and people's lives mean more than Assault Weapons!
Get the NRA and gun lobbyist out of our government!

5510 2018-02-21 03:23:29 If it takes this long to consider the banning of bump stocks as necessary, I’m terrified to imagine how many children will die before banning military-style high capacity weapons is considered measured.

#GunReformNow
5511 2018-02-21 03:23:26 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks won't satisfy the Marxists. They will keep on going after our second amendment until they abolish it.
5512 2018-02-21 03:23:13 Bump stocks and background checks. The later, shoring up information sharing across agencies. This is both acceptable and will tip gun grabbers hand. Just like DACA deal. Art of Deal.
5513 2018-02-21 03:23:11 Banning only bump stocks ain't gonna cut it, Trump.
5514 2018-02-21 03:22:56 @realDonaldTrump I’m glad you’re talking about bump stocks but we are going to hold your feet to the fire. Your actions speak louder than these words. #Resistance #GunReformNow
5515 2018-02-21 03:22:55 Bump stocks aren't mentioned in the constitution.

I admire you so much,particularly your stance not to own tobacco stocks. Watched great Frontline segment on Middle East and wondering how you justify owning Raytheon et al. Just asking. Greatly value all the good you do and your incredible work ethic Pops is smiling above
5520 2018-02-21 03:21:50 Trump pulled a fast one today by saying he has asked Justice Dept to look into curtailing use of bump stocks on AR15s. He knows that only Congress can pass a law to authorize this. Just go with Diane Feinstein's bill. He is a devious don of a bitch. him up.
5521 2018-02-21 03:21:43 Bump stocks? Really? He thinks he’s slick but bump stocks— to any real gun owner— don’t mean shit banned or not. Especially when spraying a large crowd of people. Appeasement BS.
5522 2018-02-21 03:21:25 stocks and bonds baby
5523 2018-02-21 03:21:20 Bump Stocks is their easy way out. NRA is cool w that. These kids weren't killed by bump stock. It was an assault weapon.They should be confiscated as Australia did 30 years ago following a massacre. There's just no justification for civilian ownership
#neveragain
#BlueWave2018
5524 2018-02-21 03:21:07 Trump has given orders to ban bump stocks. Assault rifles is what needs to be ban.
5525 2018-02-21 03:21:01 I'm in full support of restrictions on the bump stocks that were used in Las Vegas. They are a gimmick/toy that is absolutely unnecessary.
5526 2018-02-21 03:20:51 @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews  Strong move by Trump getting rid of the Bump stocks, great idea by Trump! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA
5527 2018-02-21 03:20:44 It's a hollow gesture. The bump stocks are not sold by the big gun manufacturers, so they're not the ones getting the profits. Hence the NRA not countering this, no money to be made.
5528 2018-02-21 03:20:40 President Trump's concern for those victimized by gun violence is commendable.

Strengthening background checks and banning bump stocks is REAL ACTION!  
2nd amendment rights are upheld just safer!
Our Nation is blessed to have safety as a top priority. Thank you Mr. Trump! 
5529 2018-02-21 03:20:32 I was responding to Hairy Nipples. He was speaking directly about losing purchasing power. It doesn’t matter if you are trading BTC, alts, cattle, stocks, forex, oil, or baseball cards. If your purchasing power declined its a losing trade. The cross currency is irrelevant
5530 2018-02-21 03:20:27 About overturning regulations, Trump just enacted more on assault weapons and bump stocks. I don't get it.
5531 2018-02-21 03:20:26 He went a little left, giving them bump stocks instead of gun bans.

5534 2018-02-21 03:20:16 1) Prior to Feb 19, 2018, if someone said they wanted to take the very small incremental gun violence prevention step of banning bump stocks, it meant he/she was a Constitution-hating tyrant who wanted to seize all guns in the US; burn every church and bible; throw everyone...
5535 2018-02-21 03:20:08 Stocks and Flows. Know the difference @algore. The amount of new investment in green energy does not exceed the amount of installed capacity in fossil fuels. First year economics. #ClimateChange @gwpf @ClimateDepot
5536 2018-02-21 03:20:05 Also, because NRA explicitly endorsed subjecting to “additional regulations” the bump stocks it took pains to note were approved by the Obama administration, while the org pushed right-to-carry reciprocity while staying mum on any of the proposed legislation banning bump stocks.
5537 2018-02-21 03:20:04 Easy one. I spoke with the NRA weeks ago and mentioned bump stocks. The rep said they already released a statement they would not oppose.
5538 2018-02-21 03:20:02 People who want bump stocks have weak trigger fingers nubes
5539 2018-02-21 03:19:48 These 8 stocks have remained FIIsâ favourite over the last 12 quarters
5540 2018-02-21 03:19:46 Whoa now he is considering bump stocks. Far from a commitment to ban.  How long until he will commit to working toward an AR15 ban impossible no. Probable not likely. #NeverAgainMSD
5541 2018-02-21 03:19:43 Kamala will vote for anything that will get her into the WH. During last months news cycle she was falling all over illegal immigrants.  We do need to institute a functional national background check, dump bump stocks, and enforce our current laws.
5542 2018-02-21 03:19:40 Violent video games don't kill people; people with semi-automatic weapons made fully automatic by bump stocks kill people.
5543 2018-02-21 03:18:52 Polling good right. Do it. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks
5544 2018-02-21 03:18:51 That's why Donald Trump is saying he's going to "IMPOSE" a new ban on bump stocks,he can't do that unless Congress and Senate pass a law,all propaganda and B******* from Donald Trump the DICTATOR once again.
5545 2018-02-21 03:18:43 Trick question. They’re all Remington 10/22’s with different stocks.  If they are semi-auto with removable magazines ban them from civilians or require high premium high deductible insurance.
5546 2018-02-21 03:18:37 If they could ban bump stocks then I seriously doubt they will be able to ban AR's.
5547 2018-02-21 03:18:20 An unnamed White House source says the slaughter of seventeen children was a reprieve for them from the Rob Porter story. During which they created the lame bump stocks story for Trump to respond to the media.
5548 2018-02-21 03:18:19 Who stands for unchecked gun laws? @DiehlFoSenate Who stands for no further restrictions on background checks, bump stocks or semi-automatic weapons? @DiehlFoSenate Who is a Trump puppet? @DiehlForSenate Why would you vote for a puppet?
5549 2018-02-21 03:18:06 my stocks are down 
5550 2018-02-21 03:18:03 Name four or five initiatives he could champion that wouldn't jeopardize his 2A campaign stance? Background checks that work - all for it. Bump stocks - gone. That's 2 and that's about it.
5551 2018-02-21 03:18:00 Oh brother - bump stocks to the second amendment are the equivalent of a spoon to a PB&J sandwich
5552 2018-02-21 03:17:24 AND banning assault weapons AND banning bump stocks
5553 2018-02-21 03:17:14 And news flash cucks: It was under Obama administration that bump stocks were made legal.
5554 2018-02-21 03:17:07 florida student emma shamed trump into pretending he will ban bump stocks...#Trump DernerDavid
5555 2018-02-21 03:16:56 He got bump stocks because the major manufacture don’t make them. They’re third party and it makes no damn difference to gun manufacturers whether they exist or not.
5556 2018-02-21 03:16:54 Get out of bed with the NRA before more kids die. Ban assault weapons if your man enough’ banning bump stocks is patronizing the NRA!
5557 2018-02-21 03:16:48 I suppose after Trumps announcement you are pro bump stocks. Right Gav? @GavinNewsom
5558 2018-02-21 03:16:46 Uh why would we care? Bump stocks aren’t a human right having a firearm to defend yourself is. Bump stocks make a gun practically full auto so it makes sense.
5559 2018-02-21 03:16:26 Why did you wait until now to move against bump stocks? To give your Base more time to stockpile them?
5560 2018-02-21 03:16:15 So wait. Floridians killed by a kid with an assault weapon and the pres wants to ban bump stocks? Isn't he one mass murder behind? Don't be fooled. #neveragain
5561 2018-02-21 03:16:04 @realDonaldTrump-Sir! I hear that you plan to outlaw the sale and use of bump stocks that make military style weapons far more deadly. KUDOS! If you take it a step further and outlaw military style assault weapons, the majority of Americans would stand behind you. No question.
5562 2018-02-21 03:15:51 Exactly they said laws must be written the bump stock is outside the per view of what they can do and than the republicans voted against the bill to outlaw bump stocks
5563 2018-02-21 03:15:46 @DLoesch Trump now pushing to ban bump stocks, with nothing in return.  If nothing else make them class 3 devices to mitigate the 1986 law banning new full auto guns made after 1986.
5564 2018-02-21 03:15:45 Parkland killings were not done with bump stocks they were accomplished with an AR. Trump/republican’s will never ban AR’s because of the money ftom the NRA.
5565 2018-02-21 03:15:41 Don, even the NRA came out against bump stocks because they do make a semi into a full.  Not a very reliable full, but still gets you to full.

But to your point, I never like a these incremental chances....like boiling frog !
5566 2018-02-21 03:15:39 I feel like the GOP and NRA already had this ready to go should another mass shooting happen. Bump stocks are a dry bone while blood spills
5567 2018-02-21 03:15:25 Even his language with sessions and bump stocks was vague. He has no intention on restricting guns or bump stocks or implementing stronger background checks. Simply trying to please with rhetoric.
5568 2018-02-21 03:15:23 Prediction: now that he wants to ban bump stocks + focus on background checks, Rs will write lame bill w immigration/wall attached that wouldn't change anything except to give Rs $$ for wall & the Ds won't pass & he will say Ds don't really want change or to protect the country.
5569 2018-02-21 03:15:20 You're fucking dreaming. They BLOCK EVERYTHING. As soon as the heat died from Vegas they dropped concern for bump stocks limits like a hot potato. If they even consider that teeny tiny measure now, it will be only because they feel up against the wall. And I wouldn't count on it.
5570 2018-02-21 03:15:19 Too bad these bump stocks have already been released to the masses and banning them won't stop people from buying them on the street.  Their value will increase now.
5571 2018-02-21 03:15:18 Ugh where can I buy the Aztec Clay? Wala daw laging stocks sa Healthy Options and the ones in Lazada are too pricey. Halos triple yung price.
5572 2018-02-21 03:15:12 Trump wants to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks and I’ll believe it when I see it but OMG IMAGINE IF OBAMA SAID THAT
5573 2018-02-21 03:14:10 Am I the only Firearms Enthusiast to be floored by the Trump Administrations proposed ban on bump stocks / accessories. Next are my Three Gun Trigger Sytems, Long Range Builds and Flarred Mag Wells.
5574 2018-02-21 03:13:45 Bump stocks and a k anything have no place in America households..
5575 2018-02-21 03:13:30 I'm fine. Bump stocks are a gimmick anyways.
5576 2018-02-21 03:13:27 Then why are you focused on bump stocks? Sad.
5577 2018-02-21 03:13:25 I get it don’t give an inch, but they are playing for keeps on this one. I think it’s smart, they don’t realize how stupid bump stocks are.
5578 2018-02-21 03:13:22 What in the world are you talking about JoannaCocoGrove? He is showing honor and respect to heroes and not movie stars. Just this very day he came out against bump stocks.
5579 2018-02-21 03:13:17 We all agree on this. Getting rid of bump stocks was a good idea also. I really hope we can focus on what causes people to want to commit these murders. Gun laws only do so much. We must fix the mental health issues in society or laws wont work. You surely understand this, Sir.
5580 2018-02-21 03:13:17 Honestly, he might gain popularity from the opposite side which he could use. The people that would be mad with this will forget by 2020 and look at the things he campaigns like the growing economy and tax cuts. Pure political move, not saying I support him banning bump stocks.
5581 2018-02-21 03:13:10 I agree with you on pretty much everything but... bump fire stocks really should not be available to the general public. No accurate shooter would own one. They’re only good for mowing and spraying. I just told my super lib dad to watch you so please don’t post this kinda shit!!!
5582 2018-02-21 03:13:10 Bump stocks are not the problem!  Phony solution to manipulate the uninformed!
5583 2018-02-21 03:13:09 Off the boat is a big word your penny day flipping weed stocks bro come on seriously you guys getting totally outta hand
5584 2018-02-21 03:13:06 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Ban assault weapons and bump stocks.
5585 2018-02-21 03:13:06 bump stocks r shit anyways.... if youre that hard up for one 3d print it
5586 2018-02-21 03:13:04 Would be a good 1st step that is assuming your actually gonna do it not just talk about it like you did bump stocks.
5587 2018-02-21 03:12:56 I did. They cannot act on them under NFA as automatic weapons because they are not automatic weapons. Automatic weapons in this context is well defined legal term. Bump stocks dont make weapon automatic, it increases rate of fire. But they have other courses, if willing, than NFA
5588 2018-02-21 03:12:53 @realDonaldTrump At last, Deceitful Donnie, has done something good and proposed a ban on bump stocks.
5589 2018-02-21 03:12:52 Even though I am a member of the NRA, I fully support the banning of bump stocks. Honestly I’m surprised the ATF has let them slip through the loophole
5590 2018-02-21 03:12:44 Full auto is illegal.  Bump stocks make a semi nearly full auto. They should be illegal by default.  Easy.
5591 2018-02-21 03:12:25 Bump stocks are not our guns! Just saying... trump will have to do something... I’ll go with getting rid of bump stocks!
5592 2018-02-21 03:12:14 So what happens to previously purchased bump stocks?
5593 2018-02-21 03:12:11 So once again citizens are held responsible for the actions of criminals and the failure of gov to protect its ppl. Today it’s bump stocks tomorrow whats next? Is this the beginning of the gun grab?? @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @RandPaul @GregAbbott_TX @DanPatrick
5594 2018-02-21 03:12:04 Wow you guys are totally out of it chill out seriously ! You talking bout the sector and any stocks sounding bit ridiculous here ...
5595 2018-02-21 03:11:42 trump: “come on, guys, give me something. They’re pains in my ass and I gotta make em think I care”
NRA: “Ok, bump stocks. Now gtfooh.”
trump: “yes sir, whatever you say, sir”
5596 2018-02-21 03:11:32 ok,  so you have nothing credible to answer and resort to shameless abuse..  thats very typical of you ...  pumping unknown stocks during up cycle and deceiving gullible investors..
5597 2018-02-21 03:11:29 In India also, many many Pharma stocks rose 50-100x, in last 15-20 years, from nothing to generics boom. That time is over, the first time thingie. Move on, to new bubbles.
5598 2018-02-21 03:11:27 Shame on everyone who chastises these kids who are in mourning for their friends, teachers and are suffering. There is zero reason for semi auto weapons or bump stocks outside of military. Your words are indefensible.
5599 2018-02-21 03:11:26 i'm guessing any questions about bump stocks would get an answer like "no bump stock, no bump stock. you're the bump stock"
5600 2018-02-21 03:11:19 Unlike you, most Democrats will do the right thing in spite of your falsely blaming them & Obama for all that's wrong in your regime. You lied again today that Obama Admin. promoted bump stocks. Republicans negated all attempts at a real ban on them including OCT 2017 ATTEMPT.
5601 2018-02-21 03:10:59 What good does restricting bump stocks do?!?!  you can do the same thing a bump stock does by sticking your thumb through your trigger guard and in your belt loop. ITS NOT THE GUNS PEOPLE!!! WHEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND THIS?!?!
5602 2018-02-21 03:10:54 Trump Caves to Gun Control Advocates. Calls for a Total Ban on Bump Stocks.
5603 2018-02-21 03:10:53 The Stock Market is a market. For stocks. #TheMoreYouKnow
5604 2018-02-21 03:10:39 Bump stocks are garbage. They burn out so quickly because they get hot real fast and only made of plastic a lot of them. A 3D printer can do that for you. Now banning the AR-15 which is really a sporting rifle I’m 100% against and iffy on the age restrictions.
5605 2018-02-21 03:10:37 Some Trump supporters defend his apparent compromise on bump stocks as "insignificant" in the big picture. But it's always the right compromising in "small, insignificant" issues while the left cries for radical socialism. It's no surprise the Overton window is so to the left
5606 2018-02-21 03:10:34 hahahahahahaha.... 

See Republicans... we don't have to repeal the Constitution.  

Took months to ban bump stocks.

Soon it will be assault weapons.
5607 2018-02-21 03:10:32 I don’t think it’s a big enough issue in the eyes of our public to make him lose support.Most people that have an issue with banning bump stocks are already are typically in strong support of Trump anyway. It’s support so strong that I don’t see it losing votes with this issue.
5608 2018-02-21 03:10:32 @BernieSanders
I contacted all my reps
And asked them to support/legislate:
Assault weapons ban (including bump stocks and high capacity magazines)
Universal background checks (especially gun shows and private sales)
If they receive $ from the NRA or Gun Lobby to not do so.
5609 2018-02-21 03:10:25 Yep! The NRA legitimately came out against bump stocks briefly after the Las Vegas thing.
5610 2018-02-21 03:10:08 It's not just bump stocks it "rate increasing devices" the ATF was reviewing. Written that way it would be open to interpretation, who is to say a lighter 3 gun trigger is not considered a rate increasing device. Very slippery slope they are getting on.
5611 2018-02-21 03:10:03 He called for a memo about a ban on bump stocks that will not go through see article &/or tweet by Feinstein. The DOJ has been looking at it for awhile
5612 2018-02-21 03:09:56 @SarahKSilverman
I contacted all my reps
And asked them to support/legislate:

5613 2018-02-21 03:09:51 I don't see it. I can't find a connection between bump stocks and the right to bear arms.
Neither side loses or gains anything meaningful. It's looks more about bragging rights than anything.
5614 2018-02-21 03:09:13 We have been fed up for way to long.I live in #lasVegasStrong they said it is to soon to talk about gun control right after it happened and it is still not time after 15 children are dead! Sandy Hook,20 babies dead and it is still not time! By the way bump stocks are still legal
5615 2018-02-21 03:09:04 @cbs46 why are you doing promos saying “Trump has banned bump stocks.”  Although he did comment on that today, they are not banned yet.
5616 2018-02-21 03:09:02 I think the proposed plan to ban Bump Stocks and Binary Triggers is a great idea. There is no practical reason for either modifier. Taking a step in the right direction. @realDonaldTrump
5617 2018-02-21 03:08:44 trump saved banning bump stocks for just such a tragedy as this. Just like he saved DACA and Dreamers to use as hostage/leverage.

Banning bump stocks alone are not even close to acceptable, the country needs to hear and heed the voices of these kids. They are not wrong.
5618 2018-02-21 03:08:30 I'm pro-gun but only a fool dies on the hill to keep bump stocks. They are a ridiculous niche item. Let it go.
5619 2018-02-21 03:08:13 Why does anybody care about Bump Stocks?  Trump supports the 2nd Amendment period.  Democrats want to ban all gun ownership.  Banning Bump stocks?  Who cares.
5620 2018-02-21 03:08:02 And the Children will lead us. Pitiful that we have no adult Republican Leaders who will step up and make our children at least feel safer. Ban AR-15 type rifles and bump stocks and the clips and the ammunition.  You will rue the day when re-election comes up.
5621 2018-02-21 03:07:56 @WhitfordBradley 
I contacted all my reps
And asked them to support/legislate:

5622 2018-02-21 03:07:32 Bump stocks can be banned with a single page letter from the ATF. No lawmakers required.
5623 2018-02-21 03:07:15 Kotak Inst Equities on consumer stocks: Turned +ve on both JUBI & NEST post the 3QFY18 results; Believe the new managements at both the companies have started regaining the lost execution excellence.
5624 2018-02-21 03:07:15 Kush needs those classified reports to correctly invest in foreign stocks. He owes the Russians a boatload.
5625 2018-02-21 03:07:09 it's almost as if he wants us to be happy with getting rid of bump stocks, while not changing anything else having to do with guns...
5626 2018-02-21 03:07:05 He also supported ban of bump stocks and we’re 5 months post-Vegas shooting and only today has it come up again. I’m hopeful for change but skeptical. In the positive side, these kids are an inspiration and may be leading the movement needed for meaningful change.
5627 2018-02-21 03:07:04 Buy Britannia Industries, target Rs 5,500: Sharekhan #stocks #tips #bse
5628 2018-02-21 03:06:54 The wording is important here. The proponents was to get rid of Bump Stocks and trigger cranks, but cant just talk rate of fire increase or you could inadvertantly get into things like competitions triggers which are legitimate tools for competition shooting.
5629 2018-02-21 03:06:53 Why don't we ban all bump stocks, lock, stock, and barrel.  Including all military style,  multi-clip, assault weapons from every street in America, from every school yard, from every church, from every corner of this once great country. And toss every NRA toady in Congress out.
5630 2018-02-21 03:06:40 stocks!
5631 2018-02-21 03:06:38 Seems simple to me bam ar15s , bump stocks, improve background check, make age to own firearm same as drinking. 21.  I think most Americans would agree.  DONE
5632 2018-02-21 03:06:32 I think you meant to say 'You're proof'....o_0
Unlike you, I know what bump stocks are and what they can and cannot do. Banning them all is useless, because they are useless.
And the LAST thing I have any patience for is a liberally insane fool from canada, blowing off.
5633 2018-02-21 03:06:25 I guess the NRA is good w/ban on bump stocks to drive up demand $$$ for the real thing.  If not, #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #CallingYourBluff #NeverAgain
5634 2018-02-21 03:06:09 *stocks. Ffs
5635 2018-02-21 03:05:56 Minor speed bump cos old men are slow learners. Trump is already offering Bump Stocks and Background Checks. We are going to the whole enchilada. Women and Kids rule.
5636 2018-02-21 03:05:53 @NancyPelosi #DNC #RNC Thanks for giving away 90% out of your $100 Million to people making less then $25000 a year. This is only a crum but you can afford it. BTW your stockholding include a GUN company!! Your offer to sell ALL your stocks and give the $ away is great! #FoxNews
5637 2018-02-21 03:05:49 Asia stocks dip, dollar recovery continues as yields rise #Market
5638 2018-02-21 03:05:47 I disagree. It's my opinion.  There r MANY changes that need to be made. From BG checks, clips sizes, bullying,mental health, bump stocks, ENFORMENT of existing laws, say something when u c issues, etc. It's not just 1 issue! I've done research to educate myself on this topic.
5639 2018-02-21 03:05:38 Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we need to go further that just strengthening background checks, including banning assault weapons, banning bump stocks, and banning armor piercing bullets.

#NeverAgain
5640 2018-02-21 03:05:36 Also a lot of relatively strong stocks already making new ATHs
5641 2018-02-21 03:05:26 I'm good with that..What do we Need bump stocks for? If anything ever happens,i doubt not having them would make a difference.Have to give them something
5642 2018-02-21 03:05:23 But there are degrees. We ALL agree you can't own a nuke. Now, let's see what ELSE we can all agree on. Maybe that domestic abusers can't have guns. Maybe a mandatory 10 day wait period. Maybe no bump stocks. There are reasonable ideas.
5643 2018-02-21 03:05:22 Hey @Wiki_Stocks, Thank you for the follow!
5644 2018-02-21 03:05:21 Bump stocks? You mean the item the NRA was ok w/ banning after Las Vegas shooting? Background checks? You mean what NRA said is ok historically (e.g., Brady Bill)? How many mass shootings (however defined) have taken place since Vegas? Do we need that many more to get other 1/
5645 2018-02-21 03:05:17 He had a chance to get rid of bump stocks but didn’t.
5646 2018-02-21 03:05:12 Banning bump stocks is hardly revolutionary. It’s kind of like having a house completely infested with mice and buying one mouse trap.
5647 2018-02-21 03:05:01 @realDonaldTrump BAD MOVE !  Banning bump Stocks or banning anything concerning guns.  NOT GOOD. Don't sell out to the Communists.  Remember THEY NEVER  compromise with ANYTHING - they just wait you out to wear down to their demands. THAT is how Satan always gets his way
5648 2018-02-21 03:04:53 りゅうおうのおしごと!7話でみっともなくボロンボロン泣いてしまった
5649 2018-02-21 03:04:38 I agree.  I think bump stocks fell through the cracks.  Don't need them.
5650 2018-02-21 03:04:36 They're "to early to talk about it" didn't work and Trump, though literally the least he could do, called for a ban on bump stocks. They're terrified
5651 2018-02-21 03:04:30 I’m not getting to excited because he  has talked to NRA. They are not against banning bump stocks. This is nothing but a political move.
5652 2018-02-21 03:04:18 First, who cares who is facilitating??? If it’s for our country’s good? Do I care that dRump will take credit for banning bump stocks if he manages to do that as he said today? No! As long as it gets done!!
5653 2018-02-21 03:04:10 He already had a response, he wants to ban bump stocks
5654 2018-02-21 03:03:55 And if they do ban bump stocks, you still have your belt loops on your pants! Lol!!
5655 2018-02-21 03:03:51 since a fresh bair is so strong and it can get you early stocks especially if the opponent doesn't change their DI in time
5656 2018-02-21 03:03:43 Tonight at 10: President Trump signed a memo to outlaw bump stocks; hear from local leaders. Two teens are suspected of planning a school attack in Plattsmouth. Plus, we'll tell you about a new study linking exercise to a longer life after breast cancer. Be sure to tune in. #LNK
5657 2018-02-21 03:03:29 Trump tweets call to strengthen background checks .   Gun control, Donald. No bump stocks,no stockpiling, only 3 guns per household.  Nra can't give politics $.  Nor individuals like mercer, Koch, Murdoch.  Do those we r getting somewhere.
5658 2018-02-21 03:03:09 Easy. Ban bump stocks, 30 days wait after gun purchased, extensive background check (background check on family too), mental health evaluation, all social media’s checked, references, every 6 months report guns to local law enforcement, ban military style guns, I can go on and on
5659 2018-02-21 03:02:54 I actually don't have a problem with this.  It's a useless bone ..... throw it.
(as in bump stocks are actually useless anyway).
5660 2018-02-21 03:02:48 The trump-GOP-NRA gang are hoping that dangling a bone (bump stocks) to the fired up students will be sufficient to calm their high emotions.
5661 2018-02-21 03:02:46 @realDonaldTrump I’m glad that the president is taking action and moving to ban bump stocks. It’s a small step in the right direction but there’s much more work to be done to solve this epidemic of gun violence
5662 2018-02-21 03:02:39 Bump stocks offered up by the NRA to appease the masses. Don't get fooled-ban assault rifles. #noshitsherlock #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
5663 2018-02-21 03:02:28 banning bump stocks sure as hell isn’t gonna do much. willfull blindness
5664 2018-02-21 03:02:25 So trump backs banning bump stocks 
5665 2018-02-21 03:02:21 Democrats tried to outlaw bump stocks and your ignorant Republican house & senate voted the measure down.
5666 2018-02-21 03:02:20 The stocks are good.
5667 2018-02-21 03:02:18 I actually would not have banned automatic weapons. However, i believe that bump stocks should be illegal because automatics are illegal therefore bumps stocks convert something legal into something illegal. Therefore they should be illegal.
5668 2018-02-21 03:02:05 As of 11:00 a.m., PSEi 8,633.91 down 88.79 points or 1.02 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5669 2018-02-21 03:01:48 It’s about time someone banned bump stocks. They basically make guns fully automatic
5670 2018-02-21 03:01:40 Is it true that @realDonaldTrump urged a ban on bump stocks because he thinks blue chip stocks are better?
5671 2018-02-21 03:01:34 Obama is the one that legalized numb stocks in his last term
5672 2018-02-21 03:01:32 #AssaultWeaponsBan ! Scotland/Australia has not had a mass shooting since they banned assault weapons.Weapons You can't appease us with small changes like banning bump stocks. That's inequate to protect our children.
5673 2018-02-21 03:01:24 Bump stocks can be made in any machine shop, this is inconsequential.
5674 2018-02-21 03:01:23 I was working a simple life. I was making payments on a car, rent. Decided to focus and work towards the ghost life I have been living. Companies, writing, stocks. Tired yet Not giving up.
5675 2018-02-21 03:00:59 The antis are hoping this will create a rest between gun owners @NRA & @realDonaldTrump its starting to happen already. If we split rank we lose! We need to remain United in 2A defense "bump stocks or not" It's not a firearm. The doggies got a bone. Trump always ahead of the game
5676 2018-02-21 03:00:29 didnt use any stocks :)
5677 2018-02-21 03:00:25 Guarentee there's some type of loophole where ATF can't ban bump stocks. It will take a Bill and I doubt that will go anywhere unless there's a Dem Congress and Trump is pressured. Trump doesn't do anything for the benefit of others.
5678 2018-02-21 03:00:13 I refer to them as "Obama stocks", since they were made legal during his regime.
5679 2018-02-21 02:59:56 Under Obama, you could have bump-stocks. Let that sink in.  #NRA #bumpstocks #bumpstock #2ndAmendment #2nd
5680 2018-02-21 02:59:51 if Sumitomo did their job really well, the trains should be fine and ample stocks of spare parts should be available. Kaya lang wala eh, di ba nga cannibalized ang ibang trains? Kinuha ang parts ng iba to say it’s working. You call that maayos? Ano na mangyayari sa spare trains?
5681 2018-02-21 02:59:50 I'll say one thing. At least Donald Trump is asking to ban bump stocks & strengthen background checks while the rest of you worthless @GOP fucks have been content to let children, concert goers, night club dancers & church goers die horrible deaths for yrs for millions in @NRA $.
5682 2018-02-21 02:59:43 Imagine the outcry had Obama banned bump stocks for semiautomatic assault rifles to convert them to illegal automatic ones.
5683 2018-02-21 02:59:37 So you are saying all of the modifications that the gun on top can have and all the bump stocks and other “accessories” are available on the gun on the bottom?
5684 2018-02-21 02:59:27 @POTUS  bump stocks were Vegas. False flag. Careful what you approve. Educate yourself on the language.
5685 2018-02-21 02:59:13 So skip it and leave bump stocks in place?
5686 2018-02-21 02:59:04 Bump stocks were from the last massacre. Catch up and maybe after the next one, you can ban assault weapons
5687 2018-02-21 02:59:00 NO - GOP r digging in. They don't support America, they support the NRA. They will look at bump stocks and background checks and they wont even take those steps seriously. We need the auto and semi auto guns off the streets -period.
5688 2018-02-21 02:58:48 Rid this country of bump stocks and AR 15s.This is NOT a slippery slope. Protect our people. I vote Rep. please don’t make me regret it .
5689 2018-02-21 02:58:40 Students everywhere, you inspire me! Your persistence has already driven action- Trump ordered Justice Dept to propose regulations to ban so-called bump stocks which can convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic weapon. #StudentsDemandAction #makingadifference #GunReformNow
5690 2018-02-21 02:58:39 Totally agree on the bump stocks & see POV on high capacity mags but even then if someone just wants to kill a bunch of people, think of the carnage from a pump or semi auto shotgun @ close range. I think we need to address the roots of this problem. Disease not just the symptom
5691 2018-02-21 02:58:21 Here we go bump stocks are going to be sold out just like they did after the same threat during the Las Vegas shooting
5692 2018-02-21 02:58:09 Confused. Didn’t Trump administration decide last year that Justice Dept couldn’t rule on bump stocks?? Didn’t they say Congress had to do it?? Does Trump know bump stocks weren’t used in #Parkland ??
5693 2018-02-21 02:58:07 Hey @realDonaldTrump how about the guns that are already like machine guns. How about doing something about those! Did you get approval from the NRA to throw this pitiful bump stocks bone to the 97% of the country who want REAL action?
5694 2018-02-21 02:58:07 Let’s face it, Trump’s words are as empty as his heart.  He knows background check enhancements will never see the light of day.  Bump stocks?  Please.  Voting out Republicans is the only way to change the laws, not to ban guns, but put reasonable controls in place.
5695 2018-02-21 02:58:05 What principal is that?
I feel no conflict supporting the second amendment and not caring if bump stocks exist.
5696 2018-02-21 02:57:50 Bump stocks and better background checks...common sense. But that’s it or risk losing your base.

5698 2018-02-21 02:57:24 No Trump, you can’t have my Bump Stocks.. this is partly why you were voted in because your support for the 2nd Amendment. I’m not a fan of this push for more regulation #ArmedCitizensStopCrime #illkeepmybumpstock #2ndAmendment #StillMyPresTho
5699 2018-02-21 02:57:14 It's foreign stocks as a percentage of my overall stock portfolio.
5700 2018-02-21 02:57:13 Asia stocks dip, dollar recovery continues as yields rise.
5701 2018-02-21 02:56:58 I over heard on the news that Trump may be taking action on bump stocks. What are your thoughts on those? And what do you think about tracer rounds? They are legal in every state except California
5702 2018-02-21 02:56:57 Bump stocks are a accessory and a stupid accessory at that. You cucks gonna cry over a worthless attachment? He essentially gave them some trash as a gift
5703 2018-02-21 02:56:52 @realDonaldTrump Ban on Bump Stocks, Modifiers!
I worked two years to get you elected. Any illegitimate attacks on the Constitution and you lose my support. What comes next? Limited rounds?
Today I am sad and feel highly betrayed. A sad day for America!
5704 2018-02-21 02:56:25 Trump cannot stop Romney from running. Notice Romney's reply? Trump has not talked about banning any kind of guns. He only asked for bump stocks to be looked at. Calm down.
5705 2018-02-21 02:56:11 Ah, "following" here was intended to describe the chronology of events - benchmarks in Asia rising after a poor showing by US stocks - rather than similar direction. I do take your point, however, and have amended to "despite".
5706 2018-02-21 02:56:09 And by replenishing the population, the value of stocks are preserved and enhanced. Without restrictions the wealth/welfare we get from such natural resources is diminished ie tragedy of the commons. Same with 3D space in urban environments or beautiful view. 

Why have parks?
5707 2018-02-21 02:56:09 Short-End treasuries fall, Asia stocks trade flat !
5708 2018-02-21 02:56:03 Bump stocks are not protected by the Constitution. I honestly don't think even the NRA will touch this. They likely suggested it, to try and get very angry NRA members to calm down and not pull their support.
5709 2018-02-21 02:55:53 Bump stocks that make a semiautomatic functionally full automatic are as low as $49. Insanity. Make common sense gun safety regulations a priority. And this from a southern boy rated sharpshooter at military a school who supports RESPONSIBLE gun ownership.
@shannonrwatts @jpc268
5710 2018-02-21 02:55:31 Just read trump signed something going to Sessions about banning bump stocks these are the devices that can turn any assault rifle into a machine gun .  Feinstein fired back if trump wants to end bump stocks trump needs to call GOP
5711 2018-02-21 02:55:10 ATF says you can't regulate bump stocks so nice try on that Fat Don. Plus the NRA doesn't carea about them anyway so that was a really safe move.  What else you got Putin's Bitch?
5712 2018-02-21 02:55:03 Bump stocks? That’s it...soooo an AR-15 is not an issue, letting a mentally ill person buy a gun also not an issue, letting the CDC study gun violence again not an issue. So are bump stocks seriously the only thing you see as a way to “curb” gun violence?
5713 2018-02-21 02:54:51 I remember his flip-flop on the bi-partisan DACA agreement so I don't believe his line of crap about supporting the ban of bump  stocks.
5714 2018-02-21 02:54:36 He can EO bump stocks. They could ban them or so heavily restrict the manufacturing that it makes it impossible to make. 

No way to legally do this with the actual weapon though.
5715 2018-02-21 02:54:32 NO Bump stocks, NO AR 15, EXTREME background checks on all buyers of pistols.  This insanity MUST STOP.  FOR ALL, FEDERALLY.
5716 2018-02-21 02:54:19 Waiting to see this reflected in the $ECOS stock price
5717 2018-02-21 02:54:04 @realDonaldTrump DO NOT CAVE ON BUMP STOCKS. While I personally couldn’t care less about bump stocks, if you are willing to restrict my right to own one, what other rights of mine are you also willing to restrict?
5718 2018-02-21 02:53:55 No, guns for sale in the US have not had burst or auto fire functionality since the 1980s. The AR-15 is basically a hunting rifle with some exterior mods that make it look like a military weapon, vs the 'normal' looking rifles with wooden stocks it is functionally identical to.
5719 2018-02-21 02:53:32 Predicted Hottake: 
"Bump stocks are shitty un-American devices that should be banned because the promote bad marksmenship."
5720 2018-02-21 02:53:19 And Barry did what? Gave us bump stocks!
5721 2018-02-21 02:53:06 Trump was backed by the NRA the same NRA who went to the atf to try n ban bumpfire stocks even though they comply with the law. Then they when to trump and he tried get the surgeon general to bypass congress. Some president.
5722 2018-02-21 02:52:51 Trump needs a Republican Senate so he needs a Senator Mittens.
The NRA supports getting rid of bump-stocks.
5723 2018-02-21 02:52:46 No NRA supporters are not opposed to regulating bump stocks and other mods. So sick of Russian troll trying to divide the US.
5724 2018-02-21 02:52:36 GOOD NEWS: Trump is making sure all the mentally ill people he approved to buy guns will not be able to purchase bump stocks. #floridaHouse #nra #guncontrolnow
5725 2018-02-21 02:51:59 A useless one and he knows it. Bump stocks are not the only method of increasing the rate of fire of a weapon.

5727 2018-02-21 02:51:23 Trump just made a VERY piss poor decision. It won't just end with Bump Fire Stocks. He just handed libs. a major victory in coming after our 2nd Amendment. He should have just had the ATF classify Bump Fire Stocks as NFA items. So incredibly stupid!
5728 2018-02-21 02:51:09 Did Trump really just ban bump stocks and that's it?
5729 2018-02-21 02:50:58 So did a little research and saw Fahmi Quadir initiated her short position in $VRX at around 234.38 .. but still hasn’t closed her short position after the stocks fallen more than 90% because she wants 0 ...  love her faith in herself but take some profits girl 
5730 2018-02-21 02:50:56 So Trump putting forth a ban on bump stocks doesn’t fucking bother anybody? No one? You are all OK with this? Are you fucking kidding me? #2a
5731 2018-02-21 02:50:53 @KangHexin Hi, what's exactly happening here? If Asian stocks were tracking Wall St, then it should be lower right? But u r saying Asian equities are trading higher following a weak lead from Wall Street.???
5732 2018-02-21 02:50:53 Thank you Mr Trump for banning bump stocks.
5733 2018-02-21 02:50:38 The AR-15 is a civilian version of a military weapon. Nothing in the 2nd Amendment prohibits regulating certain types of weapons or requiring universal background checks or eliminating certain accessories like bump stocks or silencers. Freedom has nothing to do with it.
5734 2018-02-21 02:50:33 Trump saying banning bump stocks should be considered as legitimate gun reform so it all goes away is like saying Trump should only bang porn stars every other week as they pole dance while serving cheeseburgers since his wife was busy raising the kid.
5735 2018-02-21 02:50:06 #forex Prime News: Wall Street Retreats as Dow, S&P Weighed Down by Walmart: A sharp decline in Walmart shares weighed heavily on the Dow and the S&P 500 on Tuesday to put a six-session winning streak in jeopardy, but gains in Amazon and technology stocks helped… #forexsignals
5736 2018-02-21 02:49:55 Idea! Lets:
-have a national gun registry
-have strict background checks 
-make gun owners take training and classes
-ban semi automatic weapons
-ban bump stocks and similar modifications
-create an incentive for people who already own semi automatic guns to turn them in
5737 2018-02-21 02:49:54 They wanna outlaw bump stocks but I just got a big bump in my stocks.  What’s up with that!? #MAGA
5738 2018-02-21 02:49:50 A knife won't kill 20 people in 2 minutes.

Ban bump stocks.
5739 2018-02-21 02:49:30 Background checks and Bump stocks...neither would have stopped #Parkland!
5740 2018-02-21 02:49:29 I'm good with #FixNICS and banning bump stocks but not much else here
5741 2018-02-21 02:49:22 Did you see what Trump did today with bump stocks? Obama could have done the same thing after Sandy Hook. Listen, we are on the same team, I think NeoLiberals have destroyed the democratic party. I understand why you take offense to attacks on Obama, but democrats are wiped out
5742 2018-02-21 02:48:59 3) Gun Safety & Awareness classes every 3 years in schools 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th grades.
4) A Federal ban on all "bump" stocks or any modification that create automatic weapons. A federal ban on all magazines over 10 rounds
5) I am open to talks on a gun ownership license
5743 2018-02-21 02:48:44 I say the FBI is probably behind it - they probably have stocks in weapon companies. As we know, guns stocks go up when one of these false flags happens, because sales increase for fear of more regulations. That’s the only way that makes sense - it was staged by the FBI
5744 2018-02-21 02:48:42 I don’t care about bump stocks I care about false flags and how deep state uses them to further their agenda.
5745 2018-02-21 02:48:38 UNPOPULAR OPINION: Bump stocks should have been banned immediately after the Las Vegas shooting. I'm all for defending our 2nd Amendment, but no one needs an add-on to make a gun as powerful as a fully automatic rifle that is banned in America
5746 2018-02-21 02:48:25 .@realDonaldTrump can use "bipartisan call" all he wants but HIS PROMISE to voters was to protect the #2ndAmendment He lied. Bump stocks are a ridiculous caving to democrats. #BumpFire does NOT require any devices #NRA #TCOT #GOP
5747 2018-02-21 02:48:06 @realDonaldTrump keep going forward. You called for banning bump stocks, stronger background checks, open up the CDC or some group to study these incidents. Try to find out what creates monsters like this. Stop this before it becomes a possibility in a childs mind.
5748 2018-02-21 02:47:44 Well armed in case govt tries to oppress  is 2nd amendment. What would that really mean if folks could afford the equipment?   Bump stocks r a laughingstock compared to govt arsenal.
5749 2018-02-21 02:47:31 It seems to have worked, ppl think he banned bump stocks...All he did was made a derictive to explore banning it. In other words it just another 3 card Monty trick
5750 2018-02-21 02:47:11 Bumpfire stocks, I could care less. Wouldn’t have one if you gave it to me. I disagree on ARs, that’ll be a matter for the SCOTUS to decide, and their precedents would suggest it might very well infringe.
5751 2018-02-21 02:46:50 I fully expect bump stocks that allow for assault weapons to become fully automatic to be made illegal within the next year.
5752 2018-02-21 02:46:36 I was encouraged by you call to strengthen background checks and to banning bump stocks.  The kids who are fighting for their lives wouldnt be caught dead doing either and it was a disgusting comment to make
5753 2018-02-21 02:46:28 Bump stocks were invented because automatics are illegal, and the market was willing to pay to make their rifle fire like crap. Bump stocks have never been the problem, they are a symptom of the problem.
5754 2018-02-21 02:46:12 Do the liberals arguing for less migration to Australia know that the value of their stocks and houses depend on population growth projections?
5755 2018-02-21 02:46:00 banning "bump stocks" is a smokescreen for the NRA; they could care less. Much more popular and accurate are auto-tiggers, which do the same job as bump stocks only far more efficiently and accurately. NRA can look like it's giving up something they don't give a crap about.
5756 2018-02-21 02:45:45 It’s not just him. Right Wing been attacking these students all day. Looks like America’s school children will be the ones to lead. Trump is caving on bump stocks and background checks.
5757 2018-02-21 02:45:40 @ChadPrevich Have to say I was mildly disappointed when I checked to see if you've said anything about that national conversation you say never happens or has an effect after the POTUS directed the AG to find a way to ban bump stocks and other modifications. Ah well.
5758 2018-02-21 02:45:26 If the GOP really wanted to ban bump stocks, it could be done in a day.  #nrawhores #BanBumpStocks
5759 2018-02-21 02:45:21 You must be bummed that Trump is considering control on "bump stocks". I'd complain loudly if I were you. You won't be able to shoot as many coyotes as quickly if this major infringement on your freedoms goes through.

Stand up, Joe. Stand up and fight the oppression you face.
5760 2018-02-21 02:45:13 Do you support @POTUS wanting to ban bump stocks?
5761 2018-02-21 02:44:57 several years ago @FXCM told its customers they soon could trade stocks on their platform. Anything new on this matter?
5762 2018-02-21 02:44:56 I don’t think bump stocks should be legal. Sure they are fun AF to shoot but it’s just something the avid gun owner, like myself, can do without.
5763 2018-02-21 02:44:49 i don't have it in me to criticize him for maybe pushing for a ban on bump stocks and better background checks (whatever that means). clearly it's not enough and he's probably thirsty for some positive punditry, but...
5764 2018-02-21 02:44:36 The news even says they are looking at banning bump stocks
5765 2018-02-21 02:44:32 Obama’s made bump stocks legal, I wonder why?
5766 2018-02-21 02:44:22 Hi, what's exactly happening here? If Asian stocks were tracking Wall St, then it should be lower right? But u r saying Asian equities are trading higher following a weak lead from Wall Street.???
5767 2018-02-21 02:44:22 Look up the protest outside the Whitehouse today, children led on the ground for three minutes because that is how long it took because it was that easy to buy one. Bump stocks? What made the shooter in last Vegas able to fire automatically. Clearly not illegal
5768 2018-02-21 02:44:12 Oo. Maganda kumuha k insurance, stocks, o bumili k lupa
5769 2018-02-21 02:44:01 Correct me if wrong but we haven’t had neutral SR refs for years & we always whinge about. Also doesn’t help Oz ref stocks bit thin.

5773 2018-02-21 02:43:43 Fuck I like bump stocks
5774 2018-02-21 02:43:25 In theory they are the same as any other rifle. In reality, the design on them allow for modifications like bump stocks and foldable stocks. Also, a red car is the same as a blue car, but insurance on red cars is higher because the perception of them leads to misuse.
5775 2018-02-21 02:43:18 Why wait so long about bump stocks. That should have been done in October after the Las Vegas shooting. 58 DEAD.
5776 2018-02-21 02:43:07 Good start with the bump stocks, @realDonaldTrump. Now, onto closing the background check loopholes and baking assault weapons. You'd take a big step forward as President in my book with that.
5777 2018-02-21 02:42:58 On serious note trump starting weak ban on bump stocks is both a critical pivot and the safest move possible without upsetting his base
It means while he refuses to piss off his critical base he wants desperately to be liked enough to try some form of gun ban
5778 2018-02-21 02:42:50 Didn't the manufacturer already stop production and sale of bump stocks?
5779 2018-02-21 02:42:35 1 officer for 3000 kids not enough. Resource armed guards for all schools immediately. Tighten NICS link all federal data bases. Ban bump stocks. Assault weapons are banned. AR-15 not an asssult weapon. It is a semi automatic rifle. Impose age restrictions for semi-auto rifles.
5780 2018-02-21 02:42:26 Don't stop at bump stocks. Renew the ban on assault rifles!

5781 2018-02-21 02:42:24 Bump Stocks Definition
5782 2018-02-21 02:42:19 Memorandum is not law. Let's not chase a rabid animal down a hole least we get bitten. Bump Stocks have never been designed with brains. People are responsible.
5783 2018-02-21 02:42:08 It is nothing as usual from this WH. Remember the strong rhetoric concern’g the opioid crisis? Then no follow up & more importantly no budget. AFT has already weighed in about bump stocks & the current legislation cannot touch them. It will take new legislation that Feinstein has
5784 2018-02-21 02:42:00 Then u will have everyone and their brothers picking stocks in next leg up
5785 2018-02-21 02:41:49 1/2  because OG traders got into crypto for different reasons. they got into it for the idea that crypto will rule all and fiat will die. you got into crypto as a noob for quick gains on fiat investments. for you, crypto is no different than stocks.  fyi @CryptoQF
5786 2018-02-21 02:41:44 I think its a bone he's tossing to the anti-gunners just to get them on board. Something like bump stocks is a relatively minor sacrifice.
5787 2018-02-21 02:41:42 NRA was behind banning bump stocks after Las Vegas, Congress did nothing. Money is being spread around as we speak. WWA State banned them today.
5788 2018-02-21 02:41:18 Which amendment grants the general government the power to ban stocks, or anything? Especially when the ban is from an arm of the executive branch which cannot create laws. #SlipperySlope
@RepThomasMassie @justinamash @RandPaul tag @AP4Liberty @ShaneTHazel
5789 2018-02-21 02:40:52 Trump now supports banning bump stocks?  
Yeah, that was Two Mass Shootings ago...
Maybe he's waiting for the next mass shooting before rescinding the law making it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns.

5790 2018-02-21 02:40:45 Will be opening a GO for this, and sorting things out. Will post as soon as possible for a GO. If merong stocks, 3-4 weeks after shipment from Korea. :)
5791 2018-02-21 02:40:45 will try to upload another one today or tomorrow. 
I still have old stocks will be on sale and 'luckybags' too

5794 2018-02-21 02:40:05 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks didn't kill anybody in Vegas. The issue that needs discussion is how did an elderly man get 20 something guns up to his hotel room 32 floors up? That happening is much scarier than a bump stock. Still no video or real answers to an idiotic narrative
5795 2018-02-21 02:39:40 Bump stocks are a distraction.  We need real reform.
5796 2018-02-21 02:38:45 If you're confused by @realDonaldTrump supporting a #bumpstock ban:

The @GOP will draft a bill that makes nuclear weapons available to civilians and bans bump-stocks. @TheDemocrats will vote against it.

Then Trump will insist that Dems voted against the bump-stock ban.

Get it?
5797 2018-02-21 02:38:36 Iiiinsane. Outlawing bump stocks? Isn't this essentially the starting process of ridding 2A? The government will take inch by inch... eventually those inches add up to a yard. Not a good look for Trump, which is upsetting. Arm and train teachers if we want to make a difference.
5798 2018-02-21 02:38:16 Except now Trumps taking bump stocks... what's next?
5799 2018-02-21 02:38:14 Banning bump stocks will not solve anything. We need a ban on assault weapons.
5800 2018-02-21 02:37:59 Welp the price for bump stocks, are going to sky rocket on the black market now.
5801 2018-02-21 02:37:56 Finally two things I can agree with you on today. Bump stocks and background checks.
5802 2018-02-21 02:37:51 BS.......It is up to Congress to make a law against Bump Stocks as Trump.
5803 2018-02-21 02:37:22 Stocks will sky rocket. Obama was the best gun salesman in history
5804 2018-02-21 02:37:19 Lol at trump issuing memo direct JD to ban bump stocks. Elite gaslighting
5805 2018-02-21 02:37:18 The NRA, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks.
5806 2018-02-21 02:37:15 The ammunition stocks for the ALP election campaign wud b overflowing. This impending campaign one suggest, cud b extraordinarily filthy.
5807 2018-02-21 02:37:10 It’s already illegal, as I believe it should be, for anyone to own a fully automatic weapon.  Also not they are preparing to ban bump stocks.
5808 2018-02-21 02:36:45 And how does the administration plan to get those bump stocks out of the hands of criminals, I wonder? So if they make them illegal to own, some law abiding citizens will obey the law, but how does the govt plan to force criminals to do so?
5809 2018-02-21 02:36:26 It's extremely good and cool that we're "fake" banning bump stocks simply to distract from meaningful gun control debate
5810 2018-02-21 02:36:19 #trading #investing What did well today in #stocks despite a drop $ARMO $DPW $PAGS $CASA $ATVI $CAVM $ROKU $MDB $INTC $MSFT $TORC $GRUB $XRX
5811 2018-02-21 02:36:04 Maybe the chosen one that signed bump stocks into law knows something about mass shootings
5812 2018-02-21 02:36:01 This is a diversion.  Bump Stocks should have been addresses after LV. Fake News
5813 2018-02-21 02:36:01 Bump stocks and fast release triggers are the exact same loophole. If you're cool with one, you're cool with legal machine guns.
5814 2018-02-21 02:35:54 @realDonaldTrump, @POTUS, @DonaldJTrumpJr Please do not just roll over on this Gun control.  Make the right deal.  National Reciprocity, Hearing Protection ACT.  I am all for hardening the background checks, bump stocks are a novelty, do not make Law Abiding Citizens Criminals.
5815 2018-02-21 02:35:45 Under huge pressure, Trump is writing a memo to the Attorney General to ban bump stocks! When this actually goes through, I will tell Trump it's a start! My real question is: why did it take him this long? I have a feeling because he's been in defensive mode his whole term!
5816 2018-02-21 02:35:15 bump stocks
5817 2018-02-21 02:34:54 Bump stocks are kind of redundant, in general. Using them for continuous firing, you run the risk of overheating, miss/slamfiring, or decreased accuracy of the weapon. BUT, banning them only opens the door for Libs to eat away at the 2A as much as possible. Nothing suits them.
5818 2018-02-21 02:34:45 Yes I agree ban bump stocks, and I live in California so I assumed every state went through background checks but ig not, and assault weapon is such a general term and there’s guns out there that wouldn’t be considered an assault weapon and can still do the same thing
5819 2018-02-21 02:34:44 1. That not what bump stocks do. They don’t make full auto weapons easier to use. 

2. Did you read the next paragraph? 

3. It still doesn’t make your claim that the NRA wants FA firearms for everyone true
5820 2018-02-21 02:34:21 @realDonaldTrump why are you pushing things that make no difference?  Bump stocks rarely used and you know if you give a liberal an inch he will take a mile. They will want to ban more and more. Soon they will intro magazine capacity limits. Do not sell us out
5821 2018-02-21 02:33:58 I have no objection to banning bump stocks, as long as the wording is clear that bump stocks are all they're banning. All it takes is one activist judge to interpret it the wrong way & triggers will be banned! They'll use it to get around the 2nd amendment & ban firearms.
5822 2018-02-21 02:33:41 They are not wrong...bam bump stocks, ban assault weapons...no one needs these HUMAN killing machines except the law enforcement and the military....what if it happened to Your kids???? Don't think it can????
5823 2018-02-21 02:33:27 There was a bill but Democrats added several other things to it besides bump stocks so the Republicans voted it down.
5824 2018-02-21 02:33:24 Joe trump gets thanks for nothing.Howabout he do us all a favor & steps down.He is a disgrace to our country period.All  those military style weapons should be banned not just bump stocks really Joe he deserves thanks?
5825 2018-02-21 02:32:58 Trump is pushing to ban on bump stocks. I’m sure the Dems will bitch about this too 
5826 2018-02-21 02:32:35 Despite being badgered with bad news Nifty is down only to 10360 . Any positive event can trigger a swift rally to 11k. Individual stocks though will take a long time to see their Jan highs again
5827 2018-02-21 02:32:32 Maybe you haven't seen the post of Feb 3. Also, in the current market volatility what update are you expecting. Being an investment portfolio & with good stocks, one needs to sit tight in troubled times. I am inviting you/others to write the next post. Let me know ur updates.
5828 2018-02-21 02:32:31 High capacity mags, bump stocks, limits on firing speed, limits on post-purchase alterations, limits on types of ammo. All easy to do.
5829 2018-02-21 02:32:30 What’s Trump doing banning bump-stocks?  Letting libs push him around will just get us more FFlags.  I hope Sessions ignores him.
5830 2018-02-21 02:32:27 @Wriseup @Rishu @HaggyAlerts @ChartWars @ACInvestorBlog @ACSlater @ReformedTrader11 @TraderKush We Trade all stocks
5831 2018-02-21 02:32:18 And since those bumps-stocks will be illegal, no one will ever use them again, right? Oh.
5832 2018-02-21 02:32:17 AR15s have been used in a lot of recent shootings. Let’s start there. Bump stocks are obviously bad. Even the NRA has graciously agreed to allow us to even debate that. Shore up the background checks (instead of cutting funds.) Jusy a few suggestions.
5833 2018-02-21 02:32:14 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 8,641.10 down 81.60 points or 0.94 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5834 2018-02-21 02:32:05 I don't care to spare bump stocks. Frankly I see no use for them. They're superfluous to being stupid. BUT the point about magazines & triggers IS well made. The march to disarming Americans is relentless, not easing. Ballots are ineffective means to keep our constitutional right
5835 2018-02-21 02:31:51 bump stocks are finna get banned too? what the fuck?
5836 2018-02-21 02:31:30 Who said do not ban bump stocks? Fine by me.
5837 2018-02-21 02:31:16 @realDonaldTrump stricter background checks are fine, but don’t take away our rights to buy bump stocks!! Don’t be like them!!
5838 2018-02-21 02:30:57 Trump is trying to ban bump stocks. Sounds good to me. I wonder what the left will have to say about that 
5839 2018-02-21 02:30:51 Not so fast Fatty Arbuckle!  You haven’t done one solitary thing to push for gun control until now and the most you can do is ask for background checks and stay the sale if bump stocks.  Is that the NRA whispering in your ear, you decrepit marionette?
5840 2018-02-21 02:30:48 Right, the federal govrnment doesn’t, and shouldn’t have power over individual states. If you’re in a state that doesn’t I don’t know ban bump stocks, call your governor and local congressman and petition for a bill to be passed in your state. States can do that.
5841 2018-02-21 02:30:43 I agree with all@of you. Give them a finger, they want the arm. And true, they’ll never shut up. But, automatic weapons are illegal. Shouldn’t bump stocks be too? Just saying.
5842 2018-02-21 02:30:31 Trumps abt to pull some "Atta boy"s in his rating for banning bump stocks (leaving SLIDE stocks and semi autos) standing on the graves of the 15 kids he slung under the bus last Saturday.
5843 2018-02-21 02:29:52 I guess I missed the alternate ending to The Emperor’s New Clothes, where the Emperor’s men throw the brave kid in the stocks and chuck rotten produce at him for telling the truth.

Where can I cop the director’s cut?
5844 2018-02-21 02:29:38 Tiny hands, what the he'll are you thinking (if at all). Control bump stocks!!??! How will that protect our children? You piss of your masters but mollify them with " guys, I had to do something and you don't hunt wild game using them anyway". All the while insulting the people
5845 2018-02-21 02:29:15 Asking the Justice Dept to make suggestions about “bump-stocks” is a long long way from passing gun laws.Don’t let them off so easy.
5846 2018-02-21 02:29:12 Trump pushes ban on 'bump stocks' — devices that turn weapons into 'machine guns' CNBC - 5 hours ago

A surprise turn around by Trump. Rumour is riped in DC, Trump is in deep shit with Mueller and trying to buy political good will with guns
5847 2018-02-21 02:28:40 What machine gun madness ? An what machine gun did he use? Bump stocks ,jam to much to be effective. Stick to CNN news you know nothing of guns
5848 2018-02-21 02:28:32 What turn legal what happens in two machine guns is the trigger mechanism! Not bump stocks, bump stops are for recoil!
5849 2018-02-21 02:28:22 I thought you were against bump stocks, dave.
5850 2018-02-21 02:28:18 Cmon... Bump stocks and the such... really? You might as well remove peoples hands. The school shooter didn't have anything like it. He had his finger.
5851 2018-02-21 02:28:12 The NRA probably let him give us that token because bump stocks are cheap and can just be 3d printed by any schmuck near a public library
5852 2018-02-21 02:27:59 @realDonaldTrump Just how many votes are you willing to give up in the next election by banning Bump Stocks? It is going to COST you a BUNCH!
#2a #NoGunBans #NoGunControl #MAGA #SaveBumpStocks
5853 2018-02-21 02:27:57 This reprobate will be banning bump stocks, and then selling a 3D printing machine  with a built-in 'bump stock' button right next to the power button.
5854 2018-02-21 02:27:51 @realDonaldTrump Sir, why give anything to Dems on gun laws? Bump stocks really no big deal. My question to you Mr. President, when does it stop? How many liberties and freedoms do we need to have taken away? We should stand firm with the NRA. Please don’t screw us, please.
5855 2018-02-21 02:27:42 On a separate note: sell all your stocks now. Thank you
5856 2018-02-21 02:27:40 Ugly guns are the problem, right? LOL.  You have a CIC considering bump stocks...can make them in a garage.
Zip help for A  Paddock.
Whose fooling who, here?
Pistols do the major damage.
Taking rifles stops your distance sniping ability.
Tyranny is not a close quarter fight.
5857 2018-02-21 02:27:01 Bump stocks are a step. Go all the way. Ban AR 15s and others like it!!!
5858 2018-02-21 02:26:58 He tasked Sessions with looking into regulations on bump stocks. Nothing like beating the bump stock dead horse to death. It's not a gun problem.
5859 2018-02-21 02:26:57 I know what a bump stock is bro, I'm just saying the bump stock itself isn't what kills you. Any one who has experience with guns knows bump stocks are only for fun or large crowds. I don't need nor do I ever want a bump stock. Its a waste of money
5860 2018-02-21 02:26:35 @Its_Notmyfault We don't mind TOO much if bump stock ban becomes law..playing a little poker with the gun-control freaks; bump stocks aren't that good unless skilled, and very few use 'em anyway.
5861 2018-02-21 02:26:30 What will banning bump stocks do? Anyone can make their semi automatic gun into a fully automatic without the use of a bump stock. This is a waste of time
5862 2018-02-21 02:26:29 Absolutely, and I am seeing media like USA Today actually saying Trump has "effectively banned" bump stocks?? In what universe?? Best case scenario is that Sessions orders the ATF to find some loophole 3-6 months from now and it gets tied up in court for half a decade....
5863 2018-02-21 02:26:28 @realDonaldTrump care to explain why bump stocks are being addressed now and not after the Vegas incident? Because if it's because the latest incident happened in a major swing state there are no words to describe how horrible that is. These are the things that divide us
5864 2018-02-21 02:26:02 I did read it. It says that the NRA opposes the illegalization of bump stocks, which make full auto weapons much easier to use.
5865 2018-02-21 02:25:50 しゃぶ葉じゃん
5866 2018-02-21 02:25:45 Sure.  They say that an AR15 (with a standard or extended magazine) is the same as a bolt action rifle.  In only one aspect are they the same - one pull (bump stocks and cranks excluded), one round.   A bolt action won't let me then immediately pull the trigger and fire again.
5867 2018-02-21 02:25:45 @realDonaldTrump I will give you props for trying to deal with Bump Stocks.  It’s a small start.  Next let’s look at making 21 the minimum age for any gun purchase. It’s insane you can buy at AR at 18 but not a handgun.
5868 2018-02-21 02:25:43 of Bumping Stocks, his new porn video company (Don JR, curator), specializing in classic 80's porn immediately preceding the '87 Crash.
5869 2018-02-21 02:25:07 Sorry one more point Joe- bump stocks? We need a ban on assault weapons! He too chicken and heartless to make a real difference. It’s what they call a cheap move. I could have used another word if you know what I mean.
5870 2018-02-21 02:25:06 Trade Setup: Selling Seen In Financials, Auto, Energy, FMCG, Realty Stocks
5871 2018-02-21 02:25:06 Plus the fact that it was a very limp Trumpism. How long has it been since Vegas? That was the time to at least acknowledge the attempt to ban bump stocks. Believe it or not, the majority of vendors selling bump stocks during Vegas actually pulled them from purchase, not Trumpy?
5872 2018-02-21 02:25:06 Standard operating procedure. Accuse those of what you are guilty of. Russian pawns
5873 2018-02-21 02:25:05 Trade Setup: Short Covering Seen In PSU Banks, Media Stocks
5874 2018-02-21 02:25:04 Trade Setup: Buying Seen In I.T., Metal, Textile Stocks
5875 2018-02-21 02:24:51 Really?  Ok , so assault weapons are ok ,  the problem you think , and the job you are to b engage on is Bump Stocks?
5876 2018-02-21 02:24:51 Bump stocks were made legal during Obama’s reign.  How ironic.
5877 2018-02-21 02:24:45 Mr. President, bump stocks did not commit the Las Vegas strip massacre, a madman did. A gun is nothing without a person to use it, and it is not a "killing machine" without a madman to wield it.
5878 2018-02-21 02:24:28 So Trump asked to ban bump stocks (which makes semi automatic weapons fire like automatic ones) and other gun modifications like... You should have done this shit a long time ago... I don't understand why it took this long.

5880 2018-02-21 02:24:19 1) Bump stocks have nothing to do with anything. 
2) There were multiple shooters in Las Vegas with AUTOMATIC weapons. 
3) You don't have to buy one. 
4) Just because you think something is unnecessary doesn't give the federal government authority to restrict it.
5881 2018-02-21 02:24:14 It'll be interesting to see how Schumer and Pelosi react to your proactive initiative to ban bump stocks. They'll be strategizing all night how to make this a bad thing. Idiots!
5882 2018-02-21 02:24:03 Banning Bump Stocks is like saying children deserve a more level playing field against 
#HumanHunters
5883 2018-02-21 02:23:48 You’ve been helping Russia undermine and sow discord in our country. Russian pawns!
5884 2018-02-21 02:23:41 True, but bump@stocks? Who cares. Throw them a bone. Maybe they’ll shut up a little.
5885 2018-02-21 02:23:34 Didnt he say the same thing after vegas where bump stocks were an actual factor in that shooting? Correct me if I'm wrong but Cruz did not use a bump stock. Banning bump stocks in response to cruz even tho it was vegas were they were a factor is a weak cowardly quarter measure
5886 2018-02-21 02:23:20 I want my bump stocks.
5887 2018-02-21 02:23:07 Bump stocks should be banned. I also think the AR-15 needs to go back on the ban list as well. The public does not need access to purchase this weapon.
5888 2018-02-21 02:22:50 Background checks and bump stocks won’t put a dent in the gun manufacturers flow of guns.
5889 2018-02-21 02:22:41 LOL first he caspves on bump stocks. Now background checks. It’s like we got a whole new dictator as he sees the end of his regime.
5890 2018-02-21 02:22:36 @jeffsessions, the rate of progress DOJ is currently using to prosecute Killary and the Demorats should be used in pursuing @potus request to consider a bump stock ban. That way Killary will be deceased and bump stocks will be obsolete by the time the data gathering is complete.
5891 2018-02-21 02:22:26 Bump stocks are basically useless unless skilled..not used in Vegas or any other mass-murder anyway.
5892 2018-02-21 02:22:21 Despite the fact that Obama administration approved sale bump stocks on at least 2 occasions NRA  asked that the sale be put under heavier regulations. Official NRA statement.
5893 2018-02-21 02:22:13 Banning bump stocks is common sense and a good decision.
5894 2018-02-21 02:22:11 So you must be furious right now that Trump is heralding banning bump stocks.
5895 2018-02-21 02:22:00 Will @realDonaldTrump listen to the NRA when they tell him to not ban bump stocks?
5896 2018-02-21 02:21:55 Trump wants to ban bump stocks? How long before CNN has a segment talking about how good bump stocks are and how mean Trump is for wanting to ban them? 
5897 2018-02-21 02:21:42 Well,  ain't this a simplistic meme?

Wee defend all of those things with many additional measures,  before we do so with guns. Also,  do we defend all of those things with ARs, bump stocks,  silencers, and people behind the weapons without any regard to background?
5898 2018-02-21 02:21:37 Ha, good catch. He has common sense when it comes to bump stocks, wouldn’t say in most other places. 

Not a fan of 45, but we should recognize these small victories while still keeping our eyes on the bigger picture, too.
5899 2018-02-21 02:21:36 assault weapon being the bump stocks they put on the end of rifles, semi auto rifles that carry large magazines, Mods, etc.
5900 2018-02-21 02:21:35 Coming down from D+15. Momentum against democrats: tax cut popularity, shumer shutdown, economy , trump banning bump stocks ... , dems floundering on DACA...
5901 2018-02-21 02:21:28 President Trump is NOT a hero because he is calling for a ban on bump stocks. The NRA has been advocating for more regs since Vegas. Trump is a spineless coward that takes millions of dollars from the NRA. He is complicit in these mass shootings. Vote his ass out in 2020.
5902 2018-02-21 02:21:09 HE THINKS PEOPLE ARE STUPID.  Bump stocks are a small part of the problem... a very very very very small party.  REAL GUN REFORM NOW!

5905 2018-02-21 02:20:14 Agreed.  But does he even have the power to ban bump stocks or is this just another piece of paper headed over to Congress for them to review to see if it's legal?
5906 2018-02-21 02:20:12 3/5 @kurteichenwald @TessRafferty 

7. A felony for negligence in reporting any of the above (including military).
8. No bump stocks or other alterations to increase rate of fire.
9. Makers and sellers of assault weapons or its ammunition no longer protected from litigation.
5907 2018-02-21 02:20:05 What are you doing? Stocks are falling!
5908 2018-02-21 02:20:03 Credit where credit's due. Proud of @realDonaldTrump for proposing legislation to ban bump stocks
5909 2018-02-21 02:20:02 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. forex stocks
5910 2018-02-21 02:19:57 He ordered the ATF to "look into" updating regulations to include bump stocks in the machine gun category. Asked and answered under Obama. The ATF deemed it illegal to do so. 

"Order" Congress to do its job: Legislate.
5911 2018-02-21 02:19:49 Then vote for Hillary next time.  Who the hell cares about bump stocks anyway, half the time they overheat the rifle and don’t work.
5912 2018-02-21 02:19:43 which does not describe bump stocks
5913 2018-02-21 02:19:19 Simple but, I always prefer to buy stocks on the way up than on the way down. I know. I know.
5914 2018-02-21 02:19:16 Well, you’re welcome to your opinion. I think someone who is responsible and law abiding should be able to own a rifle of their choice. 

My point on bumpfire stocks was I response to how inaccurate you thought burst fire and auto was. They’re worse.
5915 2018-02-21 02:18:36 Jonathan smokes elevated htis sad stocks ! :'(
5916 2018-02-21 02:18:27 Trump doesn’t seem to think so, he finally did something today about bump stocks
5917 2018-02-21 02:18:12 Vegas shooting was almost 4 months ago. Even my friend, the biggest NRA supporter I know says bump stocks are bullshit. Why are we still debating them? Why did trump sign a memo directing sessions to “look into the problem?” This is bullshit,less than doing nothing. DO SOMETHING
5918 2018-02-21 02:18:00 Trump is a bitch for wanting to ban bump stocks...
5919 2018-02-21 02:18:00 Willian stocks dip, dollar recovery continues as yields rise
5920 2018-02-21 02:17:59 I read that you dumped all your stocks when Trump took office, who’s the stupid person now???
5921 2018-02-21 02:17:55 I see some Second Amendment absolutists attacking the Administration's position that they want to ban bump stocks. Seriously guys, is that really the hill you want to die defending?
5922 2018-02-21 02:17:49 It feels like the fever is breaking.  Banning bump stocks is a no-brainer, but symbolically it’s big. They wouldn’t do it after Vegas. The NRA & Rs are on notice and they know it. They’re on the other end of 97-3 issue in this country. They’ve got a pair of 2s right now
5923 2018-02-21 02:17:23 I’ll say this one time and one time only... Until you address the REAL problem (hint, it’s not guns), killings will continue. And if you think Libs will be satisfied with a ban on just bump stocks, you’re in for a rude awakening.
5924 2018-02-21 02:17:02 Why didnt @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks after Vegas? Too little, too late ole chum!
5925 2018-02-21 02:16:57 Bump stocks and conversion kits are banned now, what a chad move by the president
5926 2018-02-21 02:16:50 And eats tide pods
5927 2018-02-21 02:16:47 @realDonaldTrump, you’re about to figuratively shoot yourself in the foot with the idea to ban bump stocks and the broad term of “weapons modifiers”. Most of us gun folks happen to believe in giving  #notoneinch when it comes to #2a and #guns . Gonna lose your core support pal.
5928 2018-02-21 02:16:42 Trump isn’t doing anything heroic. In Oct ‘17 the NRA announced it wanted a ban on bump stocks.
5929 2018-02-21 02:16:27 Only good solution, No
Fastest solution? Yes

Now, stop with the name calling and start caring about our kids

Bump stocks aren't illegal yet and Las Vegas was 4 months ago. You want to work on legislation, and it sounds like they will, go ahead

Protect our kids in the mean time
5930 2018-02-21 02:16:20 Bump stocks for National concealed carry reciprocity is a good deal.

5933 2018-02-21 02:15:21 I really need to learn stocks and trading..
5934 2018-02-21 02:15:11 IHUB is the worst. Many of them work for IHUB to short stocks (IHUB founder was sent to prison for this, research Janice Shell, she is probably IHUB's top paid shill) others are trolls who lost money in the market and bitter. Groups of bashers who "descend" are paid by Ihub.
5935 2018-02-21 02:15:09 trump wants to ban bump stocks.  
That is the "timely" response to the Vegas shooting.  So what about Parkland? No bump stocks there.
5936 2018-02-21 02:15:01 I do too, but it is nothing burger. ATF has looked into it & the law is narrow & about the finger & the trigger. Bump stocks require new legislation that Senator Diane Feinstein has ready to go if there was any leadership in that institution.
5937 2018-02-21 02:14:35 Problem is that bump stocks don’t actually turn the weapon into fully automatic, so terminology and classification makes it difficult to ban specifically. Obama tried to ban them  and was unable to do so.
5938 2018-02-21 02:14:31 Universal BGC won’t work without a registry. No one wanted bumpfire stocks until they talked about banning them. High capacity mags aren’t dangerous. You have to stop these folks before they get started. How did this kid slip through the cracks?
5939 2018-02-21 02:14:16 Wrong. He was always against bump stocks.
5940 2018-02-21 02:14:05 Love monopoly stocks. Can’t wait to long this soon
5941 2018-02-21 02:14:05 Bump stocks? What a joke. Guess what u can get the same gun without it. It’s the magazines not the way it looks! It’s not even the magazines it’s the crazy person getting these weapons and also learning how to use them.
5942 2018-02-21 02:13:40 #NeverTrump.So glad you got right on the bump stocks. Vegas shooting was October 1st. Maybe too much Executive time?
5943 2018-02-21 02:13:38 It’s against the right to bear arms which is the second amendment also bump stocks do not turn guns into machine guns it’s just an attachment gun control also does not work more guns=less crime BTW I am a trump supporter I am not a crazy liberal I’m just pro gun
5944 2018-02-21 02:13:34 i think the point is to use it in a down market and less so in an up market... like buying stocks in '09-10...
5945 2018-02-21 02:13:31 How many died in Oklahoma bombing no gun used there yet no one said ban fertilizer no one said ban fertilizer after 1993 World Trade Cntr bombing terrorist have used vehicles to run people down no one tries to ban them Now Trump wants to ban bump stocks after 1 issue with them
5946 2018-02-21 02:13:02 "Dear Mr Lapierre, May I please have your permission to shut these obnoxious voters up about Guns.  I am hoping you will allow me to offer them "Bump Stocks".  This way we can get them off our backs.  Please Mr LaPierre, I really need this one.  Pretty Please, Sir???" Your Donald
5947 2018-02-21 02:12:59 Make Bump Stocks need a Tax Stamp & Special Licence like other Fully Auto weapons
5948 2018-02-21 02:12:58 If you remember, a few months ago, all of the talk was about bump stocks. These were approved by the DOJ under Eric Holder and the Obama administration.
5949 2018-02-21 02:12:50 Its not the fact that we need bump stocks, its the fact that once you start giving a little on the 2A, they will keep taking.

5951 2018-02-21 02:12:37 Mr President, good job starting the process of outlawing bump stocks. You realize your memo doesn’t finish the task? Follow through on the process.
The real news will be monitoring your actions, this isn’t Hollywood. Don’t cower and cave as you have to Russia. #geterdone
5952 2018-02-21 02:12:27 Banning bump stocks is putting a bandaid on a gaping wound.  It will do little to stop gun violence
5953 2018-02-21 02:12:23 Amazing. Trump wants to ban bump stocks, yet now it’s @FoxNews @seanhannity that’s talking about “the real Russian collusion.” Absolutely disgusting. 

 #FoxNews #Hannity #bumpstock #GunControlNow
5954 2018-02-21 02:12:22 @realDonaldTrump  Just so we know, just like all you said about DACA, and lied! We know you were doing the same about bump stocks and background checks! Unlike the Republican Party we know that you can’t do anything but lie! Love guns hate Families!
5955 2018-02-21 02:12:18 Yes bump stocks who cares. Those can be made in your basement in 15 minutes and less than $2
5956 2018-02-21 02:12:08 I want my country back and I’m not willing to jeopardize that just so I can join the “ideological purity” circle jerk over something as irrelevant as bump stocks. Pick and choose your battles wisely and keep your eye on the prize.

5958 2018-02-21 02:12:04 Some one in your Administration should be aware Gun Stocks such as Bump Stocks cannot be Regulated - there needs to be a Law - and our NRA owned Congress will Again Do Nothing - Understand President Trump - I do not expect a Stable Genius such as yourself to know all this Trivia!
5959 2018-02-21 02:12:02 I feel like he asked Sessions to write a term paper on bump stocks to avoid actually doing anything about the gun problem. 
5960 2018-02-21 02:11:57 Bullish for stocks!
5961 2018-02-21 02:11:41 Am I the only one who checks stocks and is happy for the man who invested until I check the next day and know someone’s wife just left them.

5963 2018-02-21 02:11:02 The Vegas shooting was months ago and he's just now asking if bump stocks are illegal?  He's just moving his lips - he's never going to do anything to miss off the NRA.
5964 2018-02-21 02:10:49 Banning bump stocks isn't enough
We must #BanAssaultWeaponsNow (AR-15's)
We need stricter #GunControlNow
Anything less is unacceptable

5966 2018-02-21 02:10:26 We think there's been a lot of chaos thus far, what happens if Trump lead effort to strengthen background checks & outlaw bump stocks?  Shreds a lot of R talking points.
5967 2018-02-21 02:10:25 Trump Train Rolls we the Working Class Americans do not give a crap about bump stocks. 99.9% of American’s don’t own one. Anything else we will not be nice.
5968 2018-02-21 02:09:57 It's not important what current mkt price is for your stocks

What's important is the mkt price when u need to cash out

So pls do yourself a favour..stop monitoring your NAV everyday.
5969 2018-02-21 02:09:57 In the age of 3-D printing, you can outlaw bump stocks all you want. People who want them will be able to get them.
5970 2018-02-21 02:09:42 Fuck each and every single one of you hypocritical Trump supporters that saw no problem with Bump Stocks until he decided they needed to be banned. What else won’t you mind him doing since he has that magical R by his name?
5971 2018-02-21 02:09:23 Every bone huh? What happened to the musket? Can’t find the box that has your confederate army costume and confederate flag? If you can’t find it just put your white sheet on, that will work and bring your AR-15 with the bump stocks.
5972 2018-02-21 02:09:21 I dont know much, but this seems like the best option. But I want bump stocks.
5973 2018-02-21 02:09:10 The Donald Trump claiming he wants to ban bump stocks/etc. is the same Donald Trump that sat at a table a few weeks ago and said he'd sign a clean DACA bill & CIR bill. He's the same Donald Trump who has lied over 2,000 times in 1 year.
#Maddow
5974 2018-02-21 02:09:05 No one is arguing. Fact: more guns than people in US!! I do think ban the AR15. Ban bump stocks. But...my family is a hunting family. What to do? Revamp the schools!! Armed guard at door at ALL times!!! blah, blah; to ban a regular shot gun for hunting; won't work. Peace!!
5975 2018-02-21 02:09:04 Yeah, take a book out of Hollywood's playbook and look at "circumvention devices" that e.g. strip HDCP copy protection out of streams.  How can those useful tools be made illegal in a jiffy, but bump stocks can not?
5976 2018-02-21 02:09:03 Looks like he is. Discussing bump stocks and upping age for legal ownership of AR-15. Its been less than a week since the shooting. I call that action, don’t you? More to come.
5977 2018-02-21 02:09:01 projections, Schuur estimated that soils at his site in Alaska could lose two-thirds of their carbon by the end of the century. Previously, he had estimated that Arctic soils as a whole would lose just 5 to 15 percent of their carbon stocks in the same time frame."
5978 2018-02-21 02:08:58 @real Donald Trump. Strengthening background checks and outlawing bump stocks are both steps in the right direction for gun control. Too bad bump stocks were not banned after Las Vegas. Perhaps #Parkland would not have happened.
5979 2018-02-21 02:08:22 If you can head up to Brisbane, there a place in Woolloongabba called Pennisi that stocks the full range. Ease in with Chipotle and Green, advance to Black, Red and Caribbean, then complete your journey to XXX. You won't regret this, sir.

5982 2018-02-21 02:08:05 Stocks shares and trades get you paid 
5983 2018-02-21 02:07:52 Ok, so Trump “wants” to ban bump stocks. Now. He was hoping it was forgotten, but now needs something....anything! So cynical....#ImpeachTrumpNow
5984 2018-02-21 02:07:44 How many rounds is to many 5, 10 15? I will agree on the 48 hours, that doesn't really bother me. Banning bump stocks won't solve it the same affect can be achieved by putting you thumb through a belt loop, but sure take those what ever. But how many rounds is to many?
5985 2018-02-21 02:07:43 In your presidency I have only questioned one or two of your positions so far. Although I disagree with your plan to ban bump stocks from law abiding citizens, I am going to try and keep an open mind about this. Always remember who your base is.
5986 2018-02-21 02:07:41 Yea, result good. Motivation suspect. Because bump stocks not even used here at #Parkland. The real motive? #NRA @NRA gave him this. Watch they won’t comment on it.
5987 2018-02-21 02:07:25 Thats everyone try to get some fun from their bump stocks before they get confiscated
5988 2018-02-21 02:07:15 MSNBC...president is taking action, a memorandum to direct making these bump stocks and devices like that illegal. I just want to remind you, even the NRA thought that they should be made illegal.
5989 2018-02-21 02:07:12 Why do you think you need bump stocks?
5990 2018-02-21 02:07:11 I can't believe President Obama failed them by not passing any gun laws the 2 years he had supermajorities in the Senate and House and repeated declared Bump Stocks legal.
5991 2018-02-21 02:07:10 Address the buying and selling of AR15's, not banning bumper stocks. That was Vegas, which was months ago. Why are you adding insult to injury with such ignorance???
5992 2018-02-21 02:07:05 @realDonaldTrump knows regulating bump stocks can't be  done under current law. Requires legislation. His "memo" to DOJ was PR
5993 2018-02-21 02:06:49 Strengthen background checks. Ban bump stocks. #Trump’s all of a sudden sounding like a #snowflake, ain’t ‘e? Woot!
5994 2018-02-21 02:06:45 #Obama #ATF approved bump stocks,even though they let legal semiauto fire like an illegal full auto

That’s the same ATF that that ran #Fast&Furious in plot to discredit #2A

Now bump stocks being used to discredit #2A

Coincidence?

I agree with #Trump,not #Obama
#BanBumpStocks
5995 2018-02-21 02:06:37 Trump to ban bump stocks
5996 2018-02-21 02:06:31 Yes, they r accessories 2 fake news, caused great consequences such as Wall Street stocks plummet & waste of tax payers $, misuse of govt resources & slow down on positive outlook of d nation & leave bad impressions 2 other countries. These biased media should be investigated.
5997 2018-02-21 02:06:29 That's the long game, I think.  Bump stocks exist because they had to be approved by the ATF in the first place.  Nothing has changed in the laws regulating machine guns to change that.  Asking Sessions to "propose" something is a chip on the table.
5998 2018-02-21 02:06:07 Getting rid of bump stocks and Expanded background checks should happen but you will never keep illegal guns out of the hands of people. And second amendment proponents like me will never give up our guns.
5999 2018-02-21 02:05:58 right on, agree to sensible gun laws.  No one needs these weapons, make them available, but hard to get.  No bump stocks or auto-mods.
Raise the age to 21.  No blanket purchase of gun, ammo and high cap mags in 1 visit.
6000 2018-02-21 02:05:57 All he wants to pass is Bump stocks. Useless the bill and him. You don't care if children get hurt. You're in the same league as him stupid
6001 2018-02-21 02:05:25 Bump stocks arent the only speed mod.  If you allow the Left to start this snowball you'll wind up with a single shot 12 gauge with a 25 lb trigger being all that's left.
6002 2018-02-21 02:05:21 Since everyone agreed on banning bump stocks, he set it aside so he could call for it the next time there was a massive call for improved gun laws and pretend to be listening. That's all he'll do voluntarily. Now the GOP will drag their feet on it until the next school shooting.
6003 2018-02-21 02:05:12 depends... i see so many people rushing to payoff their mortgage w/o realizing they have 75%+ of their net worth in their home... this seems foolish to me... have used HELOC to buy stocks and private businesses in the past... cheap financing...
6004 2018-02-21 02:05:10 I don’t give a shit WHAT the NRA says we the people don’t want AR 15s in our society.  Those of us that hate guns have to compromise for those who love guns. But AR 15s & bump stocks are too far!
6005 2018-02-21 02:05:09 Few stocks moving higher on volume and no leadership sectors.  That makes odds of catching a big winner low.  When the odds are low I'd rather be in cash than getting chopped up.  Being in cash keeps your capital and psyche intact and ready to trade when conditions improve
6006 2018-02-21 02:04:58 Trey Gowdy on Sunday morning show said that ATF should restrict bump stocks NOW???@maddow
6007 2018-02-21 02:04:52 Bump stocks, seriously? Nope. We've move on. You had your chance @realDonaldTrump #AssaultWeaponsBan #ParklandShooting
6008 2018-02-21 02:04:52 It's more "no one needs X" which misses the point of something being a right. That said, I don't care that much about bump stocks themselves.
6009 2018-02-21 02:04:52 @realDonaldTrump You let us all down today.  you turned your back on the 2nd amendment.  You caved to the left.  Today bump stocks,  tomorrow the semi autos ... You lost my respect
6010 2018-02-21 02:04:46 Trump recommended DoJ establish regulations to ban bump stocks. To his credit, that's one good measure and a start. We have many items to check off the list, but so long as he remains prez, good that he's willing to take ONE sane measure. Now legislation. #guncontrol #gunreform
6011 2018-02-21 02:04:44 I wonder if Nigerian Christians have the luxery of being outraged by a proposal to ban bump stocks?  Probably not.
6012 2018-02-21 02:04:32 Why does every article I read about guns keep saying bump stocks make weapons automatic? Tie in the term “assault rifle?  Just say it increases rate of fire be honest!!! Still one round a pull.
6013 2018-02-21 02:04:31 He is not "banning" bump stocks - he is regulating them.
Machine guns are not "banned" - they are regulated.
6014 2018-02-21 02:04:28 Whether you are for or against the proposal of banning bump stocks, I’d be very concerned if @realDonaldTrump is steering his policy based on the opinions of foreign citizens.
6015 2018-02-21 02:04:26 @realDonaldTrump So the Dems won and you are rolling over on gun control by banning bump stocks????  WTH???  I don't recognize you lately!
6016 2018-02-21 02:04:22 Thank you on bump stocks
6017 2018-02-21 02:04:19 But, you know....all you folks who were thinking of buying bump stocks...now's the time.  Just someone drop Sessions a note when the demand slows down so he can look like he's actually going to do this.
6018 2018-02-21 02:04:17 @realDonaldTrump you are such a massive twat!!! If you cared about school children, you’d ban GUNS, not just ‘bump stocks’!! #Trumpcunt
6019 2018-02-21 02:04:13 You are missing the point.  Bump Stocks are not the problem. Guns are not the problem. People are the problem.
6020 2018-02-21 02:04:08 “My catcher sucks”
6021 2018-02-21 02:04:05 Can the military use bump stocks?
6022 2018-02-21 02:04:04 Ideas are trying to be put forward but the only one to come out of it I’ve seen is teachers getting weapons. That’s not the best way to go is it? “Gun problem? We’ll add more guns” and it’s from 2 republicans surprise surprise. All trump has done is put forward to ban bump stocks
6023 2018-02-21 02:04:01 Just like NOT implementing Russian sanctions, Mr. Shithole will do nothing about bump stocks. Does he even know it wasn't a bump stock in LV? Sick & tired of the lawless, inaction, by our so called President.
6024 2018-02-21 02:03:42 And bump stocks are just one trick to make ARs fire in full auto while skirting the definition of "machine gun." Is the ban going to cover all of them? Is it going to cover how easy it is to convert AR hardware to auto?

(hint: NO IT WILL NOT)
6025 2018-02-21 02:03:40 Bump stocks are deemed legal and will continue to be as the don't change the firing mechanism of a rifle so the ridle.isnt truly full auto it's a recoil energy transfer device. Trump knows this. This is him looking like he's doing something without doing it .
6026 2018-02-21 02:03:39 I have no clue what an assault weapon is... if it is an automatic weapon fine cause only military have it .   Like Trump banning bump stocks
6027 2018-02-21 02:03:31 Tonight on news channels:
Cooper: guns, shooting in FLA
Maddow: shooting in FLA, trump signing to regulate bump stocks
Hannity: the dossier and how it’s all lies.  

F’in really Sean????

6029 2018-02-21 02:03:09 Agreed...bump stocks have no useful function except for Vegas style massacres.
6030 2018-02-21 02:03:01 And ban AR-15s, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines as start. Then outlaw mentally ill folks from having a weapon, and authorize social services to ask if the client has access to weapons. They might lie, but if it’s a kid crying for help there’s a chance they will admit it.
6031 2018-02-21 02:02:34 Those words of "FAKE NEWS" is a Russian propaganda Tool! Yet, u still keep using it! U your self said after Las Vegas that ONLY Congress can Ban Bump Stocks, yet here u are AGAIN saying the opposite! When do u ever tell the Truth?
6032 2018-02-21 02:02:28 Trump is signing an act to try and ban bump stocks is my understanding. So last I saw the news anyway.
6033 2018-02-21 02:02:25 Turning a weapon into a fully automatic is already illegal. Bump stocks do not turn a rifle into full automatic, close but not.
6034 2018-02-21 02:02:23 Students, don’t fall for Trumps so called ban on bump stocks. He is going to say he’s doing something and he’s really not. He will still receive money from NRA as well as the rest of them. #nobreaks
6035 2018-02-21 02:02:16 Good try bad lie they should b banned assault weapons & magazines to private gun owners better background checks for gun shows & private sales, banned bump stocks etc & other things not needed to hunt or home protection for private gun owners, limit guns owned by 1 owner.
6036 2018-02-21 02:02:09 He just ordered justice dept to look into banning bump stocks. It will never happen. That’s not how our gov’t works.
6037 2018-02-21 02:02:06 And I’m completely for banning things like high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
6038 2018-02-21 02:02:05 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 8,650.89 down 71.81 points or 0.82 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
6039 2018-02-21 02:02:02 All are already banned, minus bump stocks for now, and mentally ill. The mentally ill party is the tricky one.  Who makes the diagnosis,  what" illness" warrants a lose of a right? How many pro 2a people who might need help,  not go get it for fear of losing their guns.
6040 2018-02-21 02:01:59 And hundreds were shot.  Months later Trump talks about doing something about bump stocks because he's trying to defuse a social movement that will end the availability of guns meant for mass-slaughter.
6041 2018-02-21 02:01:17 "Likely" engaged in "flirting"!!!! Oh goodness me!! To the stocks with them!!!
6042 2018-02-21 02:01:15 Tell that to the people at Route 91 Harvest festival about bump stocks. There’s no legitimate reason any civilian needs to own essentially the same weapon I had in the military..
6043 2018-02-21 02:01:06 Asia stocks higher, N Korea @VP @Uber Japan @WalMart Russia bots @YvonneManTV @EdBaxterRadio @news_Denise #DaybreakAsia Radio
6044 2018-02-21 02:01:02 so whats ur plan potus , bump stocks and getting rid of ar15 does nothing, potus dont let these kids make adult decisions u need to get rid of these illeagals they pose more of a threat to citizens
6045 2018-02-21 02:01:01 Pros and cons on stocks?
6046 2018-02-21 02:00:56 Look for the price of bump stocks to skyrocket.
6047 2018-02-21 02:00:48 Reminder:  Obama made bump stocks legal
6048 2018-02-21 02:00:37 @MSNBC reports DOJ informed WH after LV shooting bump stocks can't be regulated under current law. Requires legislation.
6049 2018-02-21 02:00:24 Trump wants to stop the sale of bump stocks. And next he will give us paper towels like he did for Puerto Rico.
Whoopee!
6050 2018-02-21 02:00:02 The problem is that it won't stop with bump stocks,  it will just be the beginning.
6051 2018-02-21 01:59:58 How about enforcing existing laws? And what took you so long to direct the AG to ban bump stocks?
6052 2018-02-21 01:59:48 Oh really? Then why did Pres. Trump have bump stocks banned and is turning up background checks. That is more than Obummer ever did with gun laws. Dems have been trying to ban for years and Trump had it done in two days.
6053 2018-02-21 01:59:46 Tired of laughing each time theu say the usa wont be buying or might not be buying Nigeria oil,first of all,most upstream oil coys and servicing oil coys re partly own by nigerians through stocks,nos 2,the transactions done by this coys re majorly outside the usa
6054 2018-02-21 01:59:28 1) You can ban assault weapons, extended magazines and bump stocks but the tooth paste is already out of the tube. There are millions of the guns already in the hands of private citizens. If a outright ban is not achievable at least eliminate extended clips and bump stocks.
6055 2018-02-21 01:59:26 MA moved to ban bump stocks pretty quickly. Nationwide, we are talking about it today?  Why so long?
6056 2018-02-21 01:59:25 y'all can ban bump stocks but what about semi automatics???
6057 2018-02-21 01:59:20 What we support: 
• Expanded background checks.
• Your gun was used to hurt someone, & perp gained access to firearm because it was not locked away, you’re looking at jail time
• Ban ban rapid-fire bump stocks
• Online threats of physical violence result in gun confiscation
6058 2018-02-21 01:59:17 better background checks (talks so far) and trying to hopefully maybe pass a bill on banning bump stocks
6059 2018-02-21 01:59:12 Suprised but happy, I have to give credit where credit is due...If this is seen through thank you for working on a ban on Bump Stocks, this will save lives. Please reconsider your stance on further restrictions and background checks on semi-automatic weaponry. @realDonaldTrump
6060 2018-02-21 01:59:10 Bump stocks=slippery slope=beehive=common sense gun reform it is not! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
6061 2018-02-21 01:59:08 So we can ban bump stocks but not assault rifles how many people have to die by an assault rifle ... ???
6062 2018-02-21 01:58:45 He was meaning to say ban Trump Stocks
6063 2018-02-21 01:58:26 I should give them a try. Been looking for a good Korean site that stocks smaller sizes, but I might start there.
6064 2018-02-21 01:58:25 And tell your dad to make sure that the bump stocks on the rifles get left alone it's stupid to go after them.
6065 2018-02-21 01:58:18 Banning bump stocks is nothing more than a dodge to keep from coming up with legislation to ban sales of assault rifles such as the AR-15, which the NRA will fight tooth and nail to prevent.  Ban semi-automatic assault weapons and there will not be a need to ban bump stocks.
6066 2018-02-21 01:58:17 Here's a fact. A guy with semiautomatic weapons fitted with bump stocks killed a bunch of people. 

You'd have trouble recognizing a fact if it walked in the room, shook your hand and introduced itself as a fact.
6067 2018-02-21 01:58:08 Haha. Yeah stocks are a little crazy right now....
6068 2018-02-21 01:57:30 My opinion is bump stocks are junk anyway. I’ve seen more dead pulls, miss-feeds and lock-ups than they’re worth! Give me a quick reset.
6069 2018-02-21 01:57:16 You had to wait 6 MONTHS to ban bump stocks!?????????
6070 2018-02-21 01:57:12 I'd like to believe he is giving them bumps stocks because he knows usually only the non proficient use them.. Will he ban Levi's? Lol
6071 2018-02-21 01:56:55 But that ship has sailed. How can we get the guns back? The logistics befuddle me.

I'm not for taking guns away, yet. I'm not entirely convinced that's the answer. I want some of them to be illegal, and bump stocks gone. Trump's even on board with that (scary I agree with him!)
6072 2018-02-21 01:56:35 On the other hand, if the assault weapons couldn't be purchased, there wouldn't be a demand for the bump stocks in the first place. Folks who want to alter that weapon will find a way with or w/o bump stocks, it's merely more convenient to buy/use pre-configured to the gun.
6073 2018-02-21 01:56:23 Did Obama really actually legalise bump stocks?
6074 2018-02-21 01:56:23 We gotta do more than that like banning bump stocks and making sure people with a mental health history can't get their hands on a gun.
6075 2018-02-21 01:56:10 It’s the NRA “slippery slope” argument that keeps the republicans from agreeing to do anything - case in point: bump stocks
6076 2018-02-21 01:55:57 He made a ban on bump stocks. Bump stocks make guns be able to fire many rounds without reloading, so then this will make it harder to kill more people. Then he is meeting with victims of other school shootings such as sandy hook.
6077 2018-02-21 01:55:49 Bump stocks are Trump’s shiny bauble.
6078 2018-02-21 01:55:47 Agreed.  Pass the bump stock legislation banning bump stocks.  Also study assault type weapons  that should be banned.  Maybe tbe AR15 is preferred because it's lightweight and low recoil.  Maybe revise the budget to reinstate Medicaid funding for mental health programs.
6079 2018-02-21 01:55:37 Trump did nothing with bump stocks after Las Vegas...
Its only with pressure from these kids that he is now finally doing something
6080 2018-02-21 01:55:30 Maybe don't assume things about me. I know quite a bit about weapons. And if an AR-15 isn't an assault rifle, what is it? After all, you can very easily make it full auto with those precious bump stocks the NRA loves so much.
6081 2018-02-21 01:55:30 Banning bump stocks unfortunately won't do anything being that 99.9% of Mass shootings don't use them. It looks good on paper though. The real issue is 18 year olds being able to buy ar-15s. You can't even buy alcohol at 18!
6082 2018-02-21 01:55:27 I'm sick of no universal background check.
I'm sick of bump stocks.I'm sick of high capacity mags.
I have a CCW. I Had a T.S In the army. I have no felonies, no tickets, no run ins with the law. 
If you have any issues, you don't need a gun. If you fail a check? On u.
My point.
6083 2018-02-21 01:55:26 I'm not a fan of bump stocks because they are an an end run around a legal ban on full auto rifles. The Vegas thing was not about bump stocks. If Trump has to give something, bump stocks are a good sacrifice.
6084 2018-02-21 01:55:20 If you bought stocks the day before the 1987 crash, you made a sh*t ton of money. Epic epic epic epic bull market since then.
6085 2018-02-21 01:55:14 Doing nothing literally means you’re complicit. Stop giving 19 year olds the ability to get AR15’s and educate your retarded candidate/President, and at least have the BALLS to tell him that bump stocks weren’t used this time. AR15’s were though.
6086 2018-02-21 01:55:10 Dump stocks banned.i have not met a real shooter who ever looked at the bump stock as more then a novelty. Nothing more.we need to look at the killer and find ways to deter these future animals from striking again.
6087 2018-02-21 01:55:09 My thoughts on BTC: It seems strong right now relative to bonds, gold, alts, and most stocks I'm following. (Not to say it's not volatile though.) I think we've confirmed the bull trend these last few days.
6088 2018-02-21 01:54:55 What do bump stocks have to do with this shooting?
6089 2018-02-21 01:54:53 Outlawing Bump Stocks. You are F**king Up. Stand strong.
6090 2018-02-21 01:54:46 And banning bump stocks and AR-15s!
6091 2018-02-21 01:54:39 @realDonaldTrump By banning bump stocks, Trump thinks he can throw the people a bone. Bump stocks weren't a factor in FL or Sandy Hook etc etc You know where u can stick ur bump stock trump. Not a good enough plan. You're just taking your orders from the NRA.
6092 2018-02-21 01:54:12 I own bump stocks for both my AR and AK. Not in a million years will it ever be considered fully automatic.
6093 2018-02-21 01:54:11 Stocks To Watch: Bank Of Baroda, Gitanjali Gems, RIL, Union Bank
6094 2018-02-21 01:54:01 And the Vegas mass murderer had nearly 20x the victims of Columbine, using what would have been Federally banned "assault rifles" augmented with bump stocks. 

As of 2017, all legally purchased.  Right?
6095 2018-02-21 01:53:56 The NRA supports banning bump stocks so Trump isn't going above and beyond. He is a fake trying to make people think he is taking a major stand which he isn't.
6096 2018-02-21 01:53:50 Truth is they should have always been illegal so Trump is literally doing the least he can do... and bump stocks have already caused many deaths in the Las Vegas massacre.
6097 2018-02-21 01:53:49 since Parkland mass shooting w/AR15 Trump considers ban of bump stocks, telling victims #bugoff
6098 2018-02-21 01:53:36 What we need, is for you to retire...and take your bump stocks with you!
6099 2018-02-21 01:53:30 I'll be on @foxnewsnight at 11:30pm tonight for a data-driven analysis with @ShannonBream of the gun control measures (bump stocks, AR-15 age) from Pres. Trump today.
6100 2018-02-21 01:53:26 Great point about bump stocks!  I'm so sorry for your loss.
6101 2018-02-21 01:53:24 Bump stocks is another Obama policy that needs to be rolled back.
6102 2018-02-21 01:53:07 Shame on @RepTimRyan . You have been looked upon as a leader in the Democratic party, and you go on #Hardball and can't take a single stance on the gun issue. Not age, not bump stocks. What if it was your kid at that school? Goddammit grow a spine! #TheResistance #GunReformNow
6103 2018-02-21 01:53:04 They bring up bump stocks which anyone with the tools can make in their own garage, I call BS! Sensible training and yearly evaluations should be mandatory, you must be mentallyfit to drive an oil / gas truck. You need to be the same to employ a firearms permit! Dammit!
6104 2018-02-21 01:53:04 @USATODAY should listen to @POTUS statement again. He said he'd write a memo.... asking ATF to look into banning bump stocks only... I asked @potus to be careful of the wording and to please consult the @NRA and @GunOwners #2ADefenders
6105 2018-02-21 01:52:55 Bump stocks are not banned. Just read today that Trump is getting after it, as well as looking at improving gun control laws that are too lax or with loopholes. Finally something to look forward to. He's gonna need help from both sides to make it happen.
6106 2018-02-21 01:52:54 Did Trump actually cuck by saying he is in support of banning bump stocks, or is it a lie the leftist media made up to discredit our savior
6107 2018-02-21 01:52:45 Sad to see the national dialogue is about to shift to bump stocks alone. While these are awful, we shouldn't shy away from the broader necessary conversation about assault weapons in general. Nobody needs an AR-15. They want them. And I want a pony. Neither of us need those tho.
6108 2018-02-21 01:52:41 Would Democrats agree to defunding Planned PH & pass Steinly Bill in exchange for GOP increasing age to buy AK like guns to 25, make illegal Bump Stocks & require background checks to be finger print so it's national?
6109 2018-02-21 01:52:41 I agree with the worthlessness of bumpfire stocks but I say fuck them they ain't getting nothing. It's only going to give them the fuzzies that they won. Fuck that
6110 2018-02-21 01:52:40 Going short on bump stocks tomorrow
6111 2018-02-21 01:52:38 They criticized Trump wanting to ban bump stocks..after screaming for the ban..You just can't take em seriously.
6112 2018-02-21 01:52:06 No. While I agree, the bump-stocks are pretty worthless, give a Commie an inch and they take you to hell with them. Don't yield, don't give them an inch. Attack. Be on offense not defense. 5 thousand Americans protect themselves with a firearm every day in US! No Mas!
6113 2018-02-21 01:51:50 Tomorrow I am going short on bump stocks.  $bump
6114 2018-02-21 01:51:44 If you support Trump you should turn in your bump stocks, not rush out and buy them.
6115 2018-02-21 01:51:34 Exactly! Plus, banning bump stocks is kind of pointless since they can be made very easily out of stuff from a hardware store.
6116 2018-02-21 01:51:22 "Dear Mr. LaPierre, May I please have your permission to sign a document that may eliminate Bump Stocks.  The people of America are riding me pretty hard and I have to give them something to shut them up. Please, Mr LaPierre, pretty please... Yours most gratefully, always Donald"
6117 2018-02-21 01:51:18 Don't care about bump stocks.
They aren't necessary to kill bad people breaking into your home or the government if they would ever start to arrest enemies of the state.
6118 2018-02-21 01:51:18 Don’t let him out of your sights, Joe. He can’t be allowed to ban gun stocks, then say he did more than anyone and rest on that. You and Mika needs to keep applying the pressure.
6119 2018-02-21 01:51:17 Hey @jack, since your stocks are higher thanks to @realDonaldTrump and his rants...can you show him how to use the thread function? Seems he doesn't and is making him look crazy. Thanks. #twittersupport @TwitterSupport
6120 2018-02-21 01:51:12 Go back and watch the footage of the Vegas shooting, listen to the gunfire sounding like a damned helicopter, and tell me that banning bump stocks is, "meaningless".
6121 2018-02-21 01:51:06 Horseshit!  Didn’t the Vegas shooter use trigger cranks and bump stocks?
6122 2018-02-21 01:50:59 CNN, NBC, CBS and ABC all reported Trump's ban on bump stocks an hour prior to Fox, so go fist yourself with Trump's tiny hands.
6123 2018-02-21 01:50:43 The founding fathers did not have AR-15s and bump stocks in mind when they made the second amendment. If you think having these things are more important than peoples lives, please go away.
6124 2018-02-21 01:50:22 Trump directed Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks and other gun modifiers without congressional oversight. They have come for us. There was no negotiation. They will be knocking on doors soon unless something is done. Supreme court must step in. I tweeted about it...
6125 2018-02-21 01:50:18 president rants incoherently and it’s not even a thing anymore. good news about the bump stocks, I guess.
6126 2018-02-21 01:50:12 F&O Ban stocks list for 21-02-2018:

    In Ban: Balrampur Chini, Dish TV, Fortis Healthcare, GMR Infrastructure, IFCI, Jain Irrigation, JP Associates

    New in ban: IFCI

    Out of ban: HDIL, Oriental Bank
6127 2018-02-21 01:49:50 To Ban Bump stocks is a start to the issue of the Mass Shooting Problem in the U.S.A is going thru,but @realDonaldTrump If you really want to solve the problem start taking MENTAL illness more serious!
6128 2018-02-21 01:49:43 @POTUS Sir, the gun community of legal gun owners are already beginning to light up. Not very many like bump stocks, however, over 1,000,000 people signed to get rid of NFA, now this. We elected a president to right the wrong, not make it worse. Sir.
6129 2018-02-21 01:49:39 @realDonaldTrump Do you think your pathetic attempt to prohibit bump stocks sales will solve the problem & make you feel like a big man? Not even close! YOU don’t have the courage to meet with students in Florida
6130 2018-02-21 01:49:34 @realDonaldTrump , good move on the bump stocks.
6131 2018-02-21 01:49:34 Strengthening background checks is a good tiny baby step. So is banning bump stocks. Still a long way to go, though, bless your heart.
6132 2018-02-21 01:49:28 No it's not. He's testing the waters. He's hoping this is "good enough."  The legislation to ban bump stocks was already written after Las Vegas.  This is nothing.
6133 2018-02-21 01:49:23 Since when can the AG ban bump stocks? Shouldn't he ask Congress to pass a bill banning them?
6134 2018-02-21 01:49:09 Yea but..... bump stocks don’t do that. So it ain’t gonna work.
6135 2018-02-21 01:49:04 Ah, the old “bump stock” deflection... remember when they banned bump stocks after Las Vegas...?

6137 2018-02-21 01:48:40 More like: Ban bump stocks + we want to provide every citizen with a bulletproof vest, but Democrats deny funding.
6138 2018-02-21 01:48:39 The NRA asked the ATF to reconsider Bump fire stocks after the LV shooting
6139 2018-02-21 01:48:36 For all stocks
6140 2018-02-21 01:48:19 Hey, @RoyBlunt I don’t even care if you keep NRA $$$$ as long as you work to strengthen background checks & ban assault weapons/bump stocks.
6141 2018-02-21 01:48:19 CS on IT stocks: Prefer stocks where margins have come off & have visibility
on recovery—Tech M & Persistent. Like mid-size cos where there is the possibility of attractive growth & have reasonable valuations: Cyient & NIIT Tech.
6142 2018-02-21 01:48:08 Yeah great catch!!!!! Because Barack Obama had total control of the government during his tenure, and no there was obstructionism present at all!!!!! I'm sure he could have banned bump stocks anytime he wanted!!!! You're blowing me away with what a great catch this is!!!!!!
6143 2018-02-21 01:48:06 D.isabled #prestRUMP : Imperfect record (2 W, 2 Many L? & 2 T)! 2 WINS - Syrian attack in response to chemical warfare & pending ban on bump stocks. Too many LOSSES to list!. 2 TIES - re-establishing the ban on elephant tusks & decommissioning the search for voter fraud. #resist
6144 2018-02-21 01:47:55 Yeah, Im just hoping it doesnt continue down a slippery slope. I could give two shits about bump stocks but thats where it starts and before we know it "assault weapons" bans start popping up.
6145 2018-02-21 01:47:50 @DLoesch @seanhannity What the heck!!! My President..strong supporter of 2A has ordered AG to “quickly” come up with new regulations on bump-stocks and “other gun modifiers”???
I have strongly supported his “conservative” values. Is this now a stab in the back??? What modifiers?
6146 2018-02-21 01:47:48 Ban Assault Weapons, bump stocks and process background checks.
6147 2018-02-21 01:47:45 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks? Kids are dying in our schools b/c of assault rifles and that’s the best you can do? History will judge you for the spineless coward you are
6148 2018-02-21 01:47:42 Not worth worrying about because IMO low probability and if so, stocks go to zero and we have bigger problems than asset allocation
6149 2018-02-21 01:47:33 Small step forward. No bump stock used in CT, TX or FL massacres. More school scares today, including one in Omaha, and likely copycats in the future. ATF claims bump stocks are “not regulated as a firearm” Do you have your thoughts and prayers locked and loaded for the next one?
6150 2018-02-21 01:47:32 I have to agree about strengthening background checks and I'm happy you wish to ban bump stocks. Now BAN the assault weapons. They are for war, not personal protection or hunting.
6151 2018-02-21 01:47:30 Banning bump stocks would not have prevented the Parkland shooting.
6152 2018-02-21 01:47:10 It's probably good that 2A activists freak out about gun control just to remind politicians how much it will hurt them to go after guns, but literally nothing will happen with our current govt and Supreme Court.

Yes, Trump "cucked" on bump stocks but the NRA did first. Big deal.
6153 2018-02-21 01:47:08 Actually Obama ordered ATF to study what bump stocks had on Violence. Right now it would take legislation to do it.
6154 2018-02-21 01:46:58 First bump stocks, then any piece of furniture that these idiots say increase the rate of fire or concealability . Soon it will be the end of Rifles and guns in general. Turns out Trump might not actually be for the 2nd Amendment. And the NRA are crossed. I will not be supporting
6155 2018-02-21 01:46:46 Well, then he's got a pretty damn good track recors.

Bump stocks are junk.
6156 2018-02-21 01:46:38 And banning bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines, and AR-15s, and reversing your dumbass decision to allow those actually deemed unable to care for themselves due to mental illness to acquire and posses firearms.  There's an opening bid.
6157 2018-02-21 01:46:38 Me too! I am very worried about the future of gun ownership right now. I honestly thought that Donald Trump would #DefendTheSecondAmendment yet he is now banning bump stocks and other devices as well as “strengthening background checks” whatever that means...
6158 2018-02-21 01:46:22 Pres Trump coming out for back ground checks on gun purchasers and making Bump stocks illegal, please write sen Heller and tell him to get behind this move ...republicans need to be pushed on this ealry before NRA squeezes them
6159 2018-02-21 01:46:14 Ban the damn bump stocks @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
6160 2018-02-21 01:46:06 Awwww, are you upset Trumpy Wumpy banned bump stocks and tweeted about more psychological evaluation?
6161 2018-02-21 01:45:58 Been curious to find out how big a business bump stocks are.
Well, business has been big enough that leading maker, Slide Fire Solutions, has been pretty active in court filing patent suits against competitors
6162 2018-02-21 01:45:50 Were bump stocks used in Las Vegas?  Would they have been able to do what was done? One 65 year old drunk gambler, 27 firearms, no video. I’ll leave it there.
6163 2018-02-21 01:45:50 Toughening the background checks and banning bump stocks would be good. The push to disarm law abiding citizens when we can't keep drugs out of our country is insane. Evil will always find a way. Need tougher regulations on the rouge FBI. Make them do their jobs the right way.
6164 2018-02-21 01:45:28 4 months since Vegas and NOW you start to do something about bump stocks?? What an obvious attempt at patching another issue you screwed up on!
6165 2018-02-21 01:45:21 @realDonaldTrump : I'm getting hammered in all the news! I've got to throw the sharks a bone! Bump stocks!
6166 2018-02-21 01:44:51 Remember when they said they were gonna ban bump stocks after the last mass shooting?

How's that's going??
6167 2018-02-21 01:44:22 Oh? Did Trump say he was gong to act unilaterally and ban bump stocks? 

Because I don't remember him saying that today. 

You've confused an Executive Order with Congress passing a law.
6168 2018-02-21 01:44:16 I'm all for changing some gun laws that are both sides can agree to, such as bump stocks, background checks for personal sales of used guns.. etc but this whole ban on assault weapons is crazy and one sided. Definition of assault weapon is pistol grip and  changeable magazine..
6169 2018-02-21 01:44:15 So we should make them legal, right? After all, they’re no more dangerous than a semi auto AR15. I mean, why worry about bumpfire stocks? There’s no danger with rapid inaccurate fire right.
6170 2018-02-21 01:44:11 Total BS. Bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. I’m sick of people who know nothing about guns saying crap like this. And I’m disappointed Trump is so quick to pander to the Left, using Obama’s tried & true method to boot after Congress failed to pass.
6171 2018-02-21 01:44:11 @realDonaldTrump if banning bump stocks might prevent a mass shooting, why not further action, like banning certain weapons?  Asking for 300 million friends.
6172 2018-02-21 01:44:05 Shooter(s) did not use bump stocks.  They had select fire weapons.
6173 2018-02-21 01:44:01 Hey. GOP...trump’s weather vane for the economy is losing money...stocks are not happy
6174 2018-02-21 01:43:55 Q: How many shooting involving bump stocks have there been since then?
6175 2018-02-21 01:43:43 Obama legalized bump stocks. Next
6176 2018-02-21 01:43:42 Donnie. You moron. You're supposed to be the 2A president backed by the NRA. Stop behaving like a reactionary Democrat. 

"Bump stocks" are just a tool.
6177 2018-02-21 01:43:42 Ban N R A from political arena.

Ban assault weapons 

Ban large capacity magazines

Ban bump stocks

21 and older for purchase

10 day waiting period

No gun show purchases
6178 2018-02-21 01:43:29 No one needs bump stocks.
6179 2018-02-21 01:43:27 @POTUS Sir, ANY tax stamp to buy or own a gun in unconstitutional and a betrayal of your base following. Are you still a friend to the 2nd Amendment? This seems like a political move, just beginning to wonder. Bump stocks were not on Vegas photos of guns.
6180 2018-02-21 01:43:21 Yes. Which doesn’t meant banning bump stocks. Turn back on this
6181 2018-02-21 01:43:18 I'm all for strengthening background checks and who cares about bump stocks...but what about the next mass shooting? Will these people admit it didn't work?
6182 2018-02-21 01:43:12 bisexual stocks
6183 2018-02-21 01:43:11 ..... mission creep.... Trump won't be President forever ya know. All bump stocks do is change rate of fire. So do my comp triggers. That's what ur dealing with, rate of fire not converting to a mg. Converting SA to FA is ALREADY a federal crime.
6184 2018-02-21 01:43:06 We disagree on tactics not desired outcome. 
Suffice it to see we can & should ban bump stocks. IMO, a mistake to throw it away.
6185 2018-02-21 01:43:06 There’s an oxymoron or US.  There are good people on both sides but the ones with bump stocks kill more.
6186 2018-02-21 01:43:05 I'm not sure any real gun owner would care. Bump stocks are very impractical and decrease accuracy. Ban-away!!
6187 2018-02-21 01:43:03 ha. trump calls for a ban on bump stocks? so people can still massacre school kids, but they'll be slightly slower while doing so. that'll fucken show 'em.
6188 2018-02-21 01:42:52 If you can use Executive Authority to ban bump stocks, you can use it to fix #DACA. C’mon man.
6189 2018-02-21 01:42:50 But was it a good investment? Gun stocks rose after the event.
6190 2018-02-21 01:42:46 I'd like a written statement MLA format, 7 pages, and PowerPoint from the 71 fuckheads explaining why the fuck you need bump stocks so bad
6191 2018-02-21 01:42:45 But not if we're talking about guns. Only bump stocks!
6192 2018-02-21 01:42:42 Not that bump stocks should even be necessary. The 2A as written to me says all arms are fair game
6193 2018-02-21 01:42:35 You will do nothing real about it. That’s why you brought up bump stocks today to deflect from school shootings . Bump stocks would have never been brought up if not for the shooting!
6194 2018-02-21 01:42:26 Please be mindful if Feinstein signs on, it's not a good thing, remember due process sir. Bump stocks are another big issue effecting millions of us and our property. 2A voters are counting on you to stand with us not anti-gun zealots They don't act in our best interests.
6195 2018-02-21 01:42:25 But a bit like US stocks or Australian property, living standards in Australia are already very high, so I think most people are OK with data like this treading water a bit. Costs of essentials are the killer.
6196 2018-02-21 01:42:24 If he does ANYTHING IN ANYWAY THAT RESTRICTS THE 2nd AMENDMENT including banning "bump stocks" he will be shocked at how quickly we will abandon him! BELIEVE IT!! If he's going to act like a Democrat then we'll vote for one instead of Trump. Ask Bush Senior what that's like!!
6197 2018-02-21 01:42:21 Trump signed legislation making it easier for mentally ill people to get guns.  He's sent a "memo" to Sessions on bump stocks.  No one is holding their breath when this known liar tries to make himself look honorable.
6198 2018-02-21 01:42:02 oh shit trump just banned bump stocks he saved the world hallelujah
6199 2018-02-21 01:41:51 By definition of “machine gun”, bump stocks DO NOT turn an assault rifle into a machine gun.
6200 2018-02-21 01:41:43 do i believe that @realDonaldTrump ‘s proposed ban on bump stocks is a step in the right direction? absolutely.
do i also believe that it’s only for good press? also, absolutely.
do i still believe that he is the worst thing to happen to this country in a long, long, time? Yup.
6201 2018-02-21 01:41:24 Republicans tried to ban bump stocks last year, but Dems wanted to add draconian unrelated items to the bill to kill it so they could blame Republicans for its failure...
6202 2018-02-21 01:41:21 BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT BUMP STOCKS KILLED NO CHILDREN AT ANY SCHOOL EVER, 
WASTING TIME
2A
3%
WAR IS NEAR
6203 2018-02-21 01:41:21 I think what the President did for bump stocks was good but very late and now we need to extend background checks and to get rid of the private sale and gun show loop holes.
6204 2018-02-21 01:41:18 The Las Vegas shooting was October 1st.  It is almost March the following year, and as President, he is passively suggesting maybe we’ll suggest doing something about Bump Stocks. 58 Americans died.  That’s concerning.
6205 2018-02-21 01:41:03 Attempt du jour to court the public that believes you're unfit for office? Why haven't you strengthened background checks earlier? Why haven't you banned bump stocks earlier? What specific legislation do you support? #NeverAgain
6206 2018-02-21 01:40:58 Should bump stocks be banned immediately?
6207 2018-02-21 01:40:57 Aren't criminals just gonna get bump stocks because they're criminals 

Lol
6208 2018-02-21 01:40:41 Saying the elimination of bump stocks is going to go a long way towards solving our gun problem is like thinking reverting to dialup Internet will solve your addiction to porn. #SchoolShooting
6209 2018-02-21 01:40:33 That would be unconstitutional. We're trying to move away from an executive branch that does whatever it wants. I'm for banning bump stocks but not that way. The system is made to be in gridlock and only when most of America wants it done, which in the case of bump stocks is true
6210 2018-02-21 01:40:29 bump stocks are a joke. if shit ever gets to the point i need a full auto i'll just make a small mod and it's done and for real, no hack.
6211 2018-02-21 01:40:25 @stocks_rachel Apologies if a personal a/c but like to highlight shortcomings with Amex Travel that goes to integrity of the Amex products
6212 2018-02-21 01:40:11 potus u know criminals can make bump stocks themselves, and since they dont care about the law ur just wasting ur time , we need to go after all crazy people mentally ill kids lock em up
6213 2018-02-21 01:40:04 Keep saying things like this!!! There may be hope for you yet Mr. President. I'm a Democrat but im praying so hard for you to do good,  be better, embrace change. I really appreciated your bump stocks (sp?) Tweet. Sounds like you're on the right track. Please, help our babies.
6214 2018-02-21 01:39:47 Really.  Bump stocks are just icing on the murder cake.
6215 2018-02-21 01:39:41 I’m pro 2A, but I feel bump stocks need regulation.
6216 2018-02-21 01:39:39 John do your job and get legislation passed in Congress to outlaw "bump stocks".
    It's also time for national background checks, stricter regulation for all automatic& semiautomatic weapons to include minimum age to purchase and a waiting time.
6217 2018-02-21 01:39:25 NRA trolls are out in full force. Something got them nervous. maybe Trumps saying he is interested in gun control??? Background checks and bump stocks ban?
6218 2018-02-21 01:39:09 "How could they do this to us?" Welcome to the ugly world of power politics where $$$ rules. My colleague was murdered in Vegas & only today-as a result of YOU-did action get taken on bump stocks. Focus, keep blinders on and we will lift you up and carry you over the finish line.
6219 2018-02-21 01:38:59 Please tell us all how many bump stocks were used to kill students last week?
6220 2018-02-21 01:38:55 I don't believe the "slippery slope" starts with bump stocks. Never had heard of them before the Vegas shooting.
6221 2018-02-21 01:38:45 You've lost my vote because of "President Trump says he’s directed AG Sessions to propose regulations to “ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns” like the bump stocks that were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting" #WeThePeople #SecondAmendment
6222 2018-02-21 01:38:35 Banning bump-stocks will cost him little, if any, support. Keeping existing (any) guns out of the wrong hands rather than outright bans will be welcome but the hard-left ban dreams will remain dreams.
6223 2018-02-21 01:38:22 @VP@IvankaTrump @foxandfriends
This is another of your many chances to do the right thing. Call out the NRA and the majority of your Republicans. Tougher background checks like you are getting a license. Ban bump stocks and semis in the same class as rifles.
6224 2018-02-21 01:38:21 Getting rid of bump stocks and fixing background checks is a god way to do something on a bipartisan manner.

But, like with DACA, Democrats don’t want a Trump to make #GunReform. It’s another talking point they won’t have anymore
6225 2018-02-21 01:38:17 Bump stocks are ammo-inefficient, accuracy-reducing novelty items. There's no valid reason for a gun owner to buy one except excess money & a desire for noise.

However, an American doesn't need to justify exercising his/her rights to govt. I urge SC congressppl to oppose a ban.
6226 2018-02-21 01:38:14 Bump stocks,Longer waiting periods, Better background checks. All needed imo. Hearing assault weapons need to be banned drives me crazy. FULL auto assault weapons are already banned.
6227 2018-02-21 01:38:03 Now the president is thinking of banning bump stocks....that should have happened after the Las Vegas shooting.   But that's not enough, automatic weapons should also be banned.  And that's just the beginning.
6228 2018-02-21 01:37:55 GOP led by @realDonaldTrump can write a Bill to eliminate Bump Stocks, make purchasing "assault type weapons" be 25 yrs of age & add 10 billion to DHS to assist in providing security to schools.  Dems give in on Kate Steinly Bill.  Easy for both with small downside.
6229 2018-02-21 01:37:51 The problem is that banning bump stocks can easily ban other types of weapons and accessories. Please get up to speed before you go giving up anything. #GunGrabbers love your tweet. #GunSense
6230 2018-02-21 01:37:50 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks today.  We expect to learn his revised position as soon as next week. (Fixed it!)

6232 2018-02-21 01:37:45 I’m not yelling.  No attitude, either.  I’m just saying that putting a ban on bump stocks is like tying to kill a flood of roaches with a napkin.
6233 2018-02-21 01:37:12 we shouldn't be. future returns on #bigoil stocks will be dismal.
6234 2018-02-21 01:37:08 .@TrueFactsStated the only way bump stocks can be banned is through legislative action, essentially Trump is handing the NRA a win on this one.  Check out Dianne Feinstein's tweet feed on this.
6235 2018-02-21 01:36:52 No, we're tired of you people thinking we're even blaming guns. We want background checks on people, not guns. We want an age limit on when people can buy the guns.  We want bump stocks outlawed. Are these really hard concepts?
6236 2018-02-21 01:36:34 Why not draft real common sense gun laws right now? What are you waiting for?  I mean, you were able to force through comprehensive tax reform in like a month.  Banning bump stocks, universal background checks, etc....ahould take like an hour.
6237 2018-02-21 01:36:26 Banning bump stocks is doing shit for our citizens.
6238 2018-02-21 01:36:05 Let's be clear. Outlying bump stocks does not eliminate assault weapons. It just prevents assault weapons from becoming super-assault weapons. Trump's pretend move is spurious.
6239 2018-02-21 01:36:05 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks' 4 months after Las Vegas shooting
6240 2018-02-21 01:35:51 No, Miss Litella.  It's bump stocks.  Bump.
. . . .
Oh.  Never mind.
6241 2018-02-21 01:35:44 This is a frustrating slippery slope but I don't think @realDonaldTrump should capitulate on the bump fire stocks, Once Bump stocks are under the purview of regulations, Triggers and other modifications may follow. If he bans those I think he should open up the Machine gun reg.
6242 2018-02-21 01:35:37 Gee, only about 5 months after bump stocks used in Las Vegas (Oct. 1).  Now deal with type of weapon used in Feb. 14th Florida school slaughter.
6243 2018-02-21 01:35:33 How @realDonaldTrump lost the #2020Election, "President Trump says he’s directed AG Sessions to propose regulations to “ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns” like the bump stocks that were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting" @MrColionNoir you agree? #2A #PPL
6244 2018-02-21 01:35:11 Did this particular shooter use bump stocks
6245 2018-02-21 01:35:09 "Trump orders Justice Dept to ban bump stocks"

INFRINGEMENT!!!
6246 2018-02-21 01:34:59 .@TrueFactsStated but they aren't giving a bump stocks at all, because the ATF itself has said it has no jurisdiction to ban them.  By doing it through the executive branch, you've guaranteed that manufacturers will be able to win a TRO.
6247 2018-02-21 01:34:58 Not enough. Do not play that game. Bump stocks regs. and background  checks have all ready been okayed by tne NRA.  We are not fools.
6248 2018-02-21 01:34:57 I'm a supporter of the 2A but I don't have a problem banning bump stocks. I'm ok with stronger background checks and even a wait period.  I don't like the idea of a ban or a registration but I can support smart measures. As a law abiding citizens these won't hinder my rights.
6249 2018-02-21 01:34:51 Trump announced he signed a "memorandum" to eliminate bump stocks today.
The very minimum he could do, without causing the NRA too many problems.
He had to give something to the "kids," to show them he is working on solutions.
He is frightened of these kids.
He should be. 
6250 2018-02-21 01:34:51 C’mon Josh! It’s a hollow promise and you know it! Bump stocks are a tiny bit of the problem!
6251 2018-02-21 01:34:39 FYI: I oppose banning bump stocks. I oppose ANY concession to gun hating liberals. My 2cents..
6252 2018-02-21 01:34:34 Why do you care about bump stocks? Honest question.
6253 2018-02-21 01:34:32 So short paper media stocks?
6254 2018-02-21 01:34:20 Bump stocks? 
When will we get a credible explanation-ANY explanation- of the Las Vegas massacre?
6255 2018-02-21 01:33:55 Do you actually know what Bump Stocks are?
6256 2018-02-21 01:33:50 @realDonaldTrump Don't mess with ANYTHING regarding the 2nd Amendment including "bump stocks". If you do we will abandon you!!! BELIEVE IT!!! Ask George Herbert Walker Bush how quickly it will happen! If you're going to act like a Democrat we'll just vote for one instead of you!
6257 2018-02-21 01:33:49 . @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @POTUS, you want to ban bump stocks and limit the age for long guns to 21.  Fine, then you better move the military draft age up to 21.  The age restriction is a ridiculous proposal that won't save a single life.
6258 2018-02-21 01:33:45 “Out of junk bonds, into bump stocks”
6259 2018-02-21 01:33:30 Bump stocks are for P_SSIES 
6260 2018-02-21 01:33:24 Why? Bump stocks were approved by the ATF why ban them, they don't hurt anyone???
6261 2018-02-21 01:33:22 Trump proposed a ban on bump stocks? If the last 12 months have taught me anything it's that at any moment now some federal judge from California is going to come swooping in and block Trump's unconstitutional order banning something protected by the bill of rights #GunReformNow
6262 2018-02-21 01:33:12 Bump stocks ban, strong background checks and 21 to buy a gun. I am all for. Bundle this with immigration issues. #DACA, wall funding, end chain migration and visa lottery. Put this all in one bill. The ball in Dems court. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
6263 2018-02-21 01:33:06 Ha! Wouldn’t be a bad gig, but seriously, don’t forget to deduct those losses! You can use them to offset gains from crypto or other capital assets like stocks :)
6264 2018-02-21 01:32:58 You betrayed us today...stabbed your base in the back!  Not sure if you are a traitor or Trojan horse but banning Bump Stocks is now only the beginning, soon magazines & ammo.  You let the genie out of the bottle.  I was on the Trump train from the beginning, now it's DUMP TRUMP!
6265 2018-02-21 01:32:49 @POTUS Sir, isn’t banning bump stocks succumbing to the hysteria. People use their fingers to operate a weapon with standard trigger, as fast or faster than a bump stock. Gun control is stupid logic from the left. People and soft targets are the problem.
6266 2018-02-21 01:32:25 Investing is not like that. Anyone can go wrong in any particular stock. That’s why you need to create a portfolio. Not investing or leaving markets is very easy solution but to stay invested you need to pick quality stocks. Better to switch to mutual fund route
6267 2018-02-21 01:32:23 Let's be clear. Outlying bump stocks does not eliminate assault weapons. It just prevents assault weapons from becoming super-assault weapons. Trump's pretend move is spurious.
6268 2018-02-21 01:32:21 Or...maybe he'll ban bump stocks.
6269 2018-02-21 01:32:08 1. Ban assault rifles, 2. Link data bases (police, mental health, school) example if student is expelled his names needs red flagged 3. More complete background checks 4. Close gunshow and private sale loopholes, 5. No bump stocks, 6. No gun if on no fly list
6270 2018-02-21 01:31:55 Weird how bump stocks were approved under the Obama Admin isn’t it?
6271 2018-02-21 01:31:46 What would you recommend? That's constitutional, of course., and that would have stopped those 17 deaths? (And that number was not all children, btw...some heroic adults.) Oh, and @POTUS just banned bump stocks.
6272 2018-02-21 01:31:32 If Trump is going to ban bump stocks, that's the least he can do. Nobody who is not the military or a SWAT team needs to fire 100-round bursts.
6273 2018-02-21 01:31:27 @realDonaldTrump Gun laws in California, Illinois, Washington. Oregon, D.C are so strict it renders 2nd amendment worthless. Instead of banning bump stocks why dont you pass an executive order nullifying the gun laws of those states & giving back 2nd amendment rights.
6274 2018-02-21 01:31:23 I'd like to see the definition of a high-capacity magazine. But I'm definitely on board with bump stocks if that's what Congress decides. All of this is missing the bigger point.
6275 2018-02-21 01:31:19 Bump Stocks are trash but you can’t give Libs an inch or they’ll take a mile.
6276 2018-02-21 01:31:19 Just a friendly reminder that Obama was the president who legalized bump stocks, and Trump is the one pushing to ban them.
6277 2018-02-21 01:31:16 Dear @POTUS @realDonaldTrump:
Banning bump stocks is all well and good, but did you consider that appeasement only leads to more demands? Or did you just forget?
6278 2018-02-21 01:31:14 Ohh 100% clear. Next will be binary triggers, then collapsable stocks, then mags then nothing but slingshots that you have to register.
6279 2018-02-21 01:30:53 It's just bump stocks.
6280 2018-02-21 01:30:52 off with the family on a road trip to QLD tomorrow. First stop - Crescent Head for a surf, then Goldie for 7 nights, then 3 nights at Crescent on way back. Only holding 2 stocks and they both looking great so very comfy leaving them for a couple of weeks
6281 2018-02-21 01:30:52 Up until you named 'bump stocks' as a first step in the gun debate, you had my full support.
I don't own one, don't want one and don't need one, but banning them is total bullshit.
And I am pretty sure you are smart enough to know that as well.
Which seriously worries me sir.
6282 2018-02-21 01:30:52 The NRA told Trump get out there throw them a bone on gun laws let's go with bump stocks American people want AR-15 assault rifles banned not bump stocks nice try Trump won't work !!
6283 2018-02-21 01:30:49 Bump stocks were approved by the Obama regime, so it's just another reversal of his policies. 
6284 2018-02-21 01:30:48 Fuck Ask Jeeves, in 7th Grade Social Studies class when learning about stocks my class voted to invest in Ask Jeeves because they liked the Butler I was pushing Google and IMG they called me dumb fuck that butler and them. I’m not bitter or anything.
6285 2018-02-21 01:30:46 But he’s talking about bump fire stocks which are a completely different matter, have nothing to do with ‘converting to automatic,’ and you know that.
6286 2018-02-21 01:30:43 Even the NRA thought bump stocks shouldn't be allowed. He must have checked with them first. AK-15s tho are ok.
6287 2018-02-21 01:30:42 I agree mate but their front row stocks are not strong. That could hurt them.
6288 2018-02-21 01:30:29 Proper legislation begins at the federal level w/ minimum wait times, a robust “who should not”data base, sensible enforced restriction on idiocy like bump stocks and a plan to replace our jails as the primary method of caring for the mentally ill. States can go farther if wanted
6289 2018-02-21 01:30:21 Bump stocks unnecessary
6290 2018-02-21 01:30:20 It makes it shoot somewhat faster, but FAR less accurate. You can make your own bump stock out of rubber bands. Or a spring. Or limp wrist it. In any event - it’s dangerous and stupid. But banning bump stocks won’t stop a determined killer....
6291 2018-02-21 01:30:15 As much as Trump has invoked protecting the 2nd Amendment, I don’t see how he can ban any firearms...but especially the AR-15 or any semi autos for that matter. I personally don’t care about bump stocks but that’s all I can live with.
6292 2018-02-21 01:30:08 Today, the not-so-great Donald J Trump did the only good thing he’s done so far (maybe in his life) — banned bump stocks at long fucking last!
6293 2018-02-21 01:30:02 Bump stocks, strong background checks, 21 to buy a gun. I am in favor. Couple this with immigration, #DACA, the Wall, and chain migration and visa lottery. Put all in one bill.
6294 2018-02-21 01:29:58 Banning bump stocks to start with which is more than Obama accomplished in 8 years.
6295 2018-02-21 01:29:48 No, need to ban assault weapons and bump stocks.  Get rid of them all, now, and everything changes.
6296 2018-02-21 01:29:45 Still searching for the language in the 2nd amendment that mentions bump stocks...
6297 2018-02-21 01:29:32 Trump is banning bump stocks. This is a start. Yes I know cruz didn’t use one, but paddock did.
6298 2018-02-21 01:29:18 #Bump stocks need to go but head numb nuts #Wray at the FBI can stay. Really Donald?? Check out the stats on knives. The last time I checked knives can be dangerous if misused.
6299 2018-02-21 01:29:15 I'm on your side, but I think you have some facts wrong-Full auto are near impossible to ownBump stocks make semi easier to fire faster.
6300 2018-02-21 01:29:12 That’s a good start. If you can create a nationwide computerized database, ban bump stocks, ban semiautomatic weapons, impose nationwide training, licensing  and registration and restrict ammo possession and magazine capacities, you’ll have done what no one could do!
6301 2018-02-21 01:29:05 Reasonable restrictions on who can purchase guns is just common sense that most Republicans I know agree with and I’m generally right of center on issues and sorry I don’t think regular citizens need assault weapons or bump stocks
6302 2018-02-21 01:29:01 Why did Obama make Bump Stocks legal? They are useless even for gun advocate.
6303 2018-02-21 01:29:00 About a thousand other variables too. Al Qaeda/ISIS, degree to which Turkish military preparedness is affected by purges, how quickly US and allies burn through their stocks of precision munitions, potential for downed airmen paraded on TV as POWs, PMFs, etc.
6304 2018-02-21 01:28:59 I do too!  I sent an email to then AG Loretta Lynch in 2016 warning of the dangers of bump stocks /slidefire stocks, and of course heard nothing.
6305 2018-02-21 01:28:45 Too bad you didn’t raise a complaint about bumb stocks when the Obama admin approved their use in 2010...0
6306 2018-02-21 01:28:41 BUMP STOCKS CAN NOT BE MADE ILLEGAL. Thats like banning the cooking of vegetables. As anyone with money and knowledge can make a bump stock with a CNC machine. And now they make CNCs like 3D printers. Maybe ban the owning and distribution but it will never be stopped!!!!
6307 2018-02-21 01:28:35 I don't understand why some people are criticizing Trump for wanting to ban bump stocks and other modifications. Trump does one good thing he still gets shit for it. Sure, a bump stock wasn't used in Parkland, but its was in Las Vegas, which got 58 people killed
6308 2018-02-21 01:28:29 @TuckerCarlson Barrel shrouds are "stocks" that surround a barrel, allowing cooling of the barrel and allowing the shooter to hold it without burning his hand on the hot barrel.
6309 2018-02-21 01:28:27 The moment you and and officemate talks about high flying stocks and he mentions a stock you own just got bust -10% overnight
6310 2018-02-21 01:28:24 you gotta talk more about Stocks and the Economy
6311 2018-02-21 01:28:23 you caved on bump stocks and now you support Romney? This isn't what we voted for.
6312 2018-02-21 01:28:11 no leniency. he has had plenty of time to ban bump stocks 45 only doing this as a try to deflect and get out of banning assault weapons. he thinks we stupid enough to be appeased by this offer. what an insult
6313 2018-02-21 01:28:10 Trump has asked the DOJ to determine if bump stocks are illegal (or not). 

Media: “TRUMP MOVES TO BAN BUMP STOCKS!!!!!” 

Lol wut.
6314 2018-02-21 01:28:08 nobody cares about bump stocks if someone wanted one bad enough from what I’ve heard u can make 1 easily i think that’s why he said it& in 2017 NRA said they’d support ban
6315 2018-02-21 01:28:06 Looking for the part of the 2nd amendment that mentions bump stocks...

6317 2018-02-21 01:27:58 Ban bump stocks and high capacity mags. May not make a difference since there are so many out there already
6318 2018-02-21 01:27:58 Ohh I feel ya. You should see my FB. Got people I’m not friends with, sharing my photos of guns at the range saying “this is the problem” and “can you believe this guy”. Now I saw where Trump is gonna bam slide fire stocks 
6319 2018-02-21 01:27:57 100% for stricter background checks & the ban of 'bump stocks'.. Definitely a good start. You'll never take the weapons, but we can still become safer in many other areas
6320 2018-02-21 01:27:53 Oh please laughable! Ban the damn AR-15 and bump stocks. Do something Right for a change! BTW...was the extra billion for netanyahu to be shuttled to Jared to pay his 666 mortgage? You know Jared is like a son to him and very, very loyal to you. That's my bet.
6321 2018-02-21 01:27:51 Bump stocks are not enough. It’s just crumbs.
6322 2018-02-21 01:27:41 Why did/does the NRA support a ban on bump stocks? I've not found any answer that lays their position out in detail. Have I missed it?
6323 2018-02-21 01:27:37 Even Trump thinks bump stocks should be banned, so a one two punch and all of our kids will be so much safer.
6324 2018-02-21 01:27:34 gonna give credit where credit is due, and say good job to trump for banning bump stocks. but it is an empty gesture in a world where seventeen kids had to die before he did something. seventeen lives sacrificed before he realized this is HAPPENING. and we’re not relenting.
6325 2018-02-21 01:27:31 @timothysykes hi, honest question, that I imagine you’ve looked into: do you think your method could work on the stocks Robinhood holds? Thank you!
6326 2018-02-21 01:27:25 What in the world do background checks have to do with CNN and MSNBC? If you want to do something about fixing our mass murder epidemic then get off your ass and do something more than ask DOJ to think about banning bump stocks, which should have been illegal all along.
6327 2018-02-21 01:27:24 The problem is broken families and a broken culture.  Banning bump stocks is meaningless and useless
6328 2018-02-21 01:27:16 I don't agree with a lot of what Trump does, but I agree fully with the ban of bump stocks.
6329 2018-02-21 01:27:13 Well if thats the case, bump stocks should be put behind licenses that cost $1000s to obtain just like fully automatic weapons.
6330 2018-02-21 01:27:10 We should definitely ban bump stocks.  Nobody believes though that @realDonaldTrump is serious about gun control.  #NeverAgain #VoteThemOut
6331 2018-02-21 01:27:07 I did not tell him about bump stocks...
6332 2018-02-21 01:27:05 Bump? As in Bump stocks correct?

6334 2018-02-21 01:26:58 You're a bit late on this one you arrogant fool! Supporting background checks and banning bump stocks will not bring back those who died in Las Vegas or at the high school in Parkland. You are not fit to sit in the Oval Office!
6335 2018-02-21 01:26:45 You all can do it. Change in politics is hard. Ask A liberal granny about Vietnam and she will tell you they just did not give up. We are with you and today I called my 2 Republican Senators who are owned by the NRA. No military weapons, no bump stocks!
6336 2018-02-21 01:26:40 And getting all automatic, semi automatic guns and bump stocks  and other devices that quicken firing speed banned, and raise the age limit to purchase guns, and close the private sale-gun show sale loop holes, and limit the number of cartridges buyers can own....
6337 2018-02-21 01:26:15 Investing in future stocks! Good to start early!!
6338 2018-02-21 01:25:58 The Las Vegas massacre happened on 10/1/17.  Why are bump stocks still available?   Your credibility is ZERO.
6339 2018-02-21 01:25:41 We will see where Trumps direction goes. The ATF has already ruled bump stocks are legal. Without a change in law, I don’t think any ban would survive a court challenge. Trump and Sessions know this.
6340 2018-02-21 01:25:35 And banning high-capacity mags, bump stocks, and assault weapons.
6341 2018-02-21 01:25:33 As someone that is often critical of you @realDonaldTrump i if I am going to be fair have to acknowledge when you do positive things as well. The banning of bump stocks and other attachments on guns is a step in the right direction and a step I appreciate seeing.
6342 2018-02-21 01:25:33 Not enough!!!!  Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, make it illegal for parents not to lock up weapons, no interstate travel with concealed weapon permit. @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
6343 2018-02-21 01:25:14 Bump and slidefire stocks are just bullshit gimmicks. I wouldn't waste any political capital trying to keep them from being regulated. Same with  trigger cranks.
6344 2018-02-21 01:25:08 In regards to gun control I'd like to clarify my stances. 
I DO NOT support a ban on all guns
I DO supporting weapons similar to AR-15's
I DO support carrying permits 
I DO support banning bump stocks that convert guns to fully automatic
6345 2018-02-21 01:25:00 @ByronBernstein  sup, can you give me any of ur stocks to invest 5k in I dont care if high risk I want to get lucky :) thx
6346 2018-02-21 01:24:59 Too little too Late ! Background checks,Bump stocks,assault weapons,&expanded clips, NO Gun over 10 rounds..
6347 2018-02-21 01:24:58 banning bump stocks is a no brainer move
6348 2018-02-21 01:24:49 clearly it is or wouldn’t u have stopped im literally laying in bed reading stocks while u try to convince me ur not pressed. so continue
6349 2018-02-21 01:24:49 If these silly people believe that Banning bump stocks will reduce violence, go for it. At this point I would agree to rubber bullets just to shut them up. They don't have a clue and nothing will be accomplished. But they will feel empowered. Dumbest word ever...
6350 2018-02-21 01:24:45 A good first step but we also need bans on assault weapons & bump stocks, which are NOT protected by 2nd Amend.
6351 2018-02-21 01:24:36 Trump is banning bump stocks for 4 months. Can Britain take this ass off our hands?
6352 2018-02-21 01:24:25 Is this like "I will release my tax returns" or "I will sign any DACA bipartisan deal brought to me"?  We need LAWS on bump stocks and background checks:  NATIONALLY, just like the NRA has pushed to have lax gun laws, on a national--not State--level.
6353 2018-02-21 01:24:24 Beating bump stocks into sidewalk chalk
6354 2018-02-21 01:24:23 @TuckerCarlson 
Tucker, I normally support your arguments, today's show Tue 2/20/18 WE NEED TO BAN AR15'S!!!!!!!BUMP STOCKS!!! YOUR SCIENTIFIC STUDY DOES NOT INCLUDE MASS SHOOTINGS!!!
6355 2018-02-21 01:24:14 I’m a card carrying member of the NRA and a proud supporter of the 2A. But hell yes bump stocks should be banned. Further, let’s make a comprehensive background check for firearms purchases. Hell, even include a psych eval! Ban the crazies and criminals, not the guns!
6356 2018-02-21 01:24:04 "Kill the NRA" One of the reasons I support Trump is his wealth of common sense. You want to ban bump stocks-sure. You want to raise the age to purchase an AR-15 to 21-sure. You want the FBI & cops to do their job on background checks--hell yeah. No slippery slope lies from him
6357 2018-02-21 01:24:02 I'm guessing you probably ignored the fact trumps pushing legislation to ban bump stocks and other rifle components deemed unnecessary.... but yea he's terrible
6358 2018-02-21 01:23:55 Trump can’t sign a executive order on AR-15’s they have to write and pass the laws these bump stocks originated under obama
6359 2018-02-21 01:23:52 bump stocks effectively make ARs fully automatic.
6360 2018-02-21 01:23:47 Hurr Durr... Too retarded to read the news, bump stocks are banned tard ass. Read the paper for once. That shit Lord named Trump just put in gun regulations but you couldn't see under your fatrolls to notice. Get a life loser lmao
6361 2018-02-21 01:23:46 The Prez has to start with something tho bump stocks wasn't used in the recent case
6362 2018-02-21 01:23:32 Gun show in Doswell this weekend.  Think I need to cash in some stocks and get a Barrett.
6363 2018-02-21 01:23:26 Bump stocks were NOT used in the school massacre. This is just a distraction from the fact that ARs are the issue at hand. "Look we're doing something you asked for." But that "something" doesn't do anything to address the instant problem.
6364 2018-02-21 01:23:26 Wow, banning bump stocks as a solution? Really? How do we present logical arguments with factual data to counter leftists demands for gun control if you throw out an illogical, nonsensical compromise offer that literally solves nothing?
6365 2018-02-21 01:23:11 Get the sod and shame him. Put him in the stocks at Forrest Place just for a day and let him see how much fun that is!!
6366 2018-02-21 01:23:06 donald did something good what he seriously is going to ban bumper stocks if true about time
6367 2018-02-21 01:22:51 #DonaldTrump "The NRA says it's okay to ban bump stocks, since they are not weapons. And muzzle loading firearms because they're old. And Trebuchets because no one knows what those are."
6368 2018-02-21 01:22:48 Out of the hundreds of mass shootings, how many of the shooters used bump stocks? One. So, how would this help?
6369 2018-02-21 01:22:44 Ok. Well it sounds like we’re on the same page. 2A is fine except for semi automatic rifles and bump stocks. Is there anything we should know about ammo clips?
6370 2018-02-21 01:22:43 Background checks and making bump stocks illegal is not enough! The kids who survived the massacre in Florida are coming after you and the other NRA asskissers. Too bad you’re not man enough to meet with them. You lack empathy, sympathy common sense and soul.
6371 2018-02-21 01:22:37 hey stocks are down watch out
6372 2018-02-21 01:22:34 Somewhat disappointed...please don't cater to liberals demands to take away our Second Amendment right as guaranteed in our Constitution.  Banning stocks is only the first step toward their goal.  This is NOT Nazi Germany!
6373 2018-02-21 01:22:29 The bar is so low for Trump. Bump stocks, the lowest hanging fruit were not used in Parkland. Trump is a puppet of the #NRA, bought with 30+ million so of course NRA you'd this. NRA approved actions will not stop the next #Parkland.
6374 2018-02-21 01:22:29 @realDonaldTrump  ban on bump stocks to placate the whiners? Have no right to limit what any American can attain! The reason the 2nd Amendment exist mostly to stop the infringement of the government.
6375 2018-02-21 01:22:24 As far as gun control, I'll wait and see if this goes past bump stocks, which I'm fine with doing away with an accessory whose main purpose is to be a technicality to violate the auto weapon ban.
6376 2018-02-21 01:22:19 Aaaay good news trump actually proposed a ban to bump stocks this is a relatively small but meaningful step in the right direction
6377 2018-02-21 01:22:09 You have an error.

...when manufacturers of the stocks asked the ATF to review their product, the federal agency determined that the stocks did alter the weapon in a way that would fall under its definition of a machine gun, making them legal to sell.

Should be 'did not alter'.
6378 2018-02-21 01:22:04 LaPierre made a phone call.  All the collectors got their message that they ought to go out and buy lots of bump stocks.  Meanwhile Sessions dilly-dallies and sashays toward a policy that will never be enacted.
6379 2018-02-21 01:21:58 NO BAN ON BUMP STOCKS
6380 2018-02-21 01:21:54 @POTUS President Trump, You are making a Huge Mistake calling for a Bump Stock Ban Sir! I voted for you because I believed in you! Banning Bump Stocks is like giving a rabbit one bite of a carrot! The rabbit WILL eat the whole carrot! Disappointed! 
6381 2018-02-21 01:21:44 Florida legislators stood up bravely to refuse any legislation banning so called  assault weapons though you surrendered quickly to ban bump stocks. You need to learn from them & stick to your election promises.
6382 2018-02-21 01:21:40 Trump has magically evolved on gun control, calling for background checks and a ban on bump stocks, and I'm honestly so confused??
6383 2018-02-21 01:21:25 I wonder how many federal judges will rush to block Trump's unconstitutional ban on bump stocks?
6384 2018-02-21 01:21:24 I do think a ban on bump stocks is fine though. It won’t affect my life or interests any.
6385 2018-02-21 01:21:09 Ps. Good for trump on recognizing the issue with bump stocks. What his order means, I honestly don't know. Could be some political ploy for all I know. But fuck it. #awareness #idowantanuzitho #whodoesnt #cartelshit #hoodstuffwithmyfriends #gambinocrimefamilythings
6386 2018-02-21 01:21:02 Collab with Parker
6387 2018-02-21 01:20:50 Bump stocks up the fire rate, making a semi-auto weapon basically fully automatic. They should be banned but it would do nothing to solve the problem of gun violence.
6388 2018-02-21 01:20:47 Don't see many bump stocks or 40 round magazines attached to a Browning BAR.  Its about the availabilty and accountability of who holds the weapon.  Weapons of long range w/ high full-powered rounds should be bolt action...not semiauto or selective fire for the general public.
6389 2018-02-21 01:20:23 And no need  for bump stocks or the AR15 and much needed access to mental health professionals
6390 2018-02-21 01:20:20 But you want to get bump stocks and other trigger modifications.
6391 2018-02-21 01:20:08 No problem... Background checks, Bump Stocks and Age 21 regulation... sounds good.  But beware of DEMS getting their nose under the tent!
6392 2018-02-21 01:20:04  Well Said!
Some May say this is the first step in taking away Our 2nd Amendment Rights!?
I Would Counter That Bump Stocks Were Designed To Side Step The Rules Of Law On Who Can Own A AutoMatic Weapon!
We Do Not Need Bump Stocks IMHO!

Please reread before replying-
6393 2018-02-21 01:19:59 President Trump has ordered regulations to ban bump stocks. Making automatic weapons less likely to be in the hands of everyday Americans. #j2150cl
6394 2018-02-21 01:19:55 Not a big deal. Bump stocks are toys. No realistic use.
6395 2018-02-21 01:19:53 "...to the Department of Justice to PROPOSE a ban on bump stocks.." He "ordered" them to "propose a ban"... Close, but not quite?

6397 2018-02-21 01:19:48 Bump stocks allow a gun owner to circumvent the law and turn their semi-auto rifle into a full-auto rifle, the traditional way of doing this is to replace the bolt assembly which is illegal without a class 3 license.
6398 2018-02-21 01:19:46 Bump stocks weren’t invented when the 2 nd amendment was written
6399 2018-02-21 01:19:41 Anyone wanna bet that Trump tries to make a deal to get rid of bump stocks? Like funding for the wall or a sweet DACA scam in exchange for the bump stock ban?
6400 2018-02-21 01:19:38 Need a statute banning bump fire stocks and drop-in triggers and other devices which get around the law, and providing clear authority for FBI and other law enforcement to arrest persons like Parkland shooter who threaten gun violence.
6401 2018-02-21 01:19:31 Obama admin issued letters on several occasions reflecting their view that bump stocks didn’t violate existing law. That’s different than legalizing them. One of the rare moments where I actually applaud his admins effort to interpret existing law appropriately. Not the same..
6402 2018-02-21 01:19:21 @realDonaldTrump finally agreeing to make bump stocks illegal. Too bad it’s only because the NRA green lighted the move. It is the LEAST they will do. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
6403 2018-02-21 01:19:20 Bump stocks are useless and hard to use anyway. Most people with ARs don't have them and don't care about them. This isn't a victory for the anti gun crowd I assure you.
6404 2018-02-21 01:19:20 We do understand these networks are laughing stocks! Always get a kick out of there fake news.
6405 2018-02-21 01:19:12 

Liberals in 2017: Ban bump stocks!
*Trump wants to ban bump stocks*
Liberals now: Banning bump stocks isn’t enough!
6406 2018-02-21 01:18:46 Wtf does banning bump stocks have to do with abortion.
6407 2018-02-21 01:18:45 Banning sale of bump stocks doesn't serve to stop people from getting their hands on bump stocks, because people can build/import them readily. It's a step in the right direction. Curtail freedom to bear firearms, impose lots more restrictions on sale of unfinished parts too
6408 2018-02-21 01:18:19 Not true on almost everything. Bump stocks are illegal in Canada and should be banned in the US. As for mags, they are the same, flash suppressor, yep! Barrel should, yep, pistol grip, yep. Folding stock, not likely but completely possible.
6409 2018-02-21 01:18:10 Why didn’t you condemn trump today for directing justice department to propose banning bump stocks today? This seems hypocritical...
6410 2018-02-21 01:18:07 Well.. if bump stocks are banned, you will still be a good law abiding citizen for not having one.
6411 2018-02-21 01:17:46 I don't mind banning bump stocks.  Trigger assemblies can ALWAYS be modded.
6412 2018-02-21 01:17:26 Reason why a gap happens in stocks is very different for a reason why a "gap" happens in bitcoin

Basically the candle closed at the bottom of the spread, then the very next trade was at the top of the spread. It's very visible when the spread is REALLY wide, like Stamp always is
6413 2018-02-21 01:17:19 @DonaldTrump Hope this is fake news or you just lost 83% od your support.  "Trump urges ban on 'bump stocks,' other gun modifiers"
6414 2018-02-21 01:17:17 I don’t think you understand how stocks work
6415 2018-02-21 01:17:09 Russia continues to flood our social media with divisive posts and you have not fully implemented sanctions. Children are DEAD and the best you can offer is that you have instructed the AG to look into banning bump stocks? That is not enough. No civilian needs an assault rifle.
6416 2018-02-21 01:16:43 From the outside looking in, the trade assets are there to make that happen.

Good luck.
6417 2018-02-21 01:16:34 Bump stocks were not illegal when Trump took office. You’re a liar
6418 2018-02-21 01:16:18 I completely support you trump but the recent call for a ban on bump fire stocks isn’t the right thing to do you are giving into the left!!
6419 2018-02-21 01:16:11 Bump stocks were not illegal when Trump took office. Why do you always have to lie?
6420 2018-02-21 01:16:08 @realDonaldTrump you lost my support after today taking an anti 2nd amendment stance bump stocks and other devices don’t turn anything into an automatic. You don’t need a bump stock you can simulate with you belt loop. You are being advised wrong and FYI the NRA is Loosing SPRT.
6421 2018-02-21 01:16:06 You know Russian bots are pushing gun control, so you want to ban bump stocks. Are you falling for it or working with them?
6422 2018-02-21 01:16:03 I think it is a planned negotiation.  Bump stocks and fixing our call-in background checks are ok if controlled .  No one wants weapons in the hands of Rabid Liberals!
6423 2018-02-21 01:16:02 Put in stocks.
6424 2018-02-21 01:15:53 Really good from Trump on trying to ban bump stocks. If it goes through I’ll give him major props and it’s a really good step in the right direction.
6425 2018-02-21 01:15:53 Exactly.  

KEEPERS:  “You have to give them something.”

TRUMP: “But won’t the NRA be mad?”

KEEPERS: “They said give ‘em bump stocks.  AK-15s generate WAY more revenue.”
6426 2018-02-21 01:15:52 Bump stocks are a gimmick and do not convert semi auto into full auto. They use momentum to increase the rate at which the trigger is pulled. I prefer enforcing the laws on the books before creating new ones that open the door to banning other accessories.
6427 2018-02-21 01:15:44 @FLGovScott  Making our kids live in prisons while armed lunatics roam free is not a solution.  

Our kids deserve stricter background checks with no gun show loop holes and bans on bump stocks & assault weapons. Check the Brady Bill for legal-challenge proof language.
6428 2018-02-21 01:15:40 So wait a minute. The president can just arbitrarily ban something? Did he really ban bump stocks or did he call for a ban?
6429 2018-02-21 01:15:39 Bolt action hunting rifles don’t have high capacity magazines, flash suppressors, barrel shrouds, folding stocks, bump stocks, pistol grips or other modular components designed solely to fire bullets accurately as fast as you can pull the trigger.
6430 2018-02-21 01:15:33 He’s calling for the ban of bump stocks.
6431 2018-02-21 01:15:11 There was a executive order that removed Obama Administration protections against people with mental health problems from acquiring guns. Today I saw they actually going ban bump stocks.
6432 2018-02-21 01:15:10 Ban the bump stocks, we don't care. It's not like they help us do anything other than waste money. Horrible accuracy. Its just made for fun.
6433 2018-02-21 01:15:07 I don’t care about bump stocks. Besides, think of how much fun you can have rubbing it in Liberals’ faces that Trump succeeded where Obama failed for 8 years.
6434 2018-02-21 01:15:00 I will cheer when he has the courage to ban military style weapons and bump stocks. The NRA is covered with blood and the majority of the House of Reps.
6435 2018-02-21 01:14:59 First the ATF says they dont regulate bump stocks it going to take a law and we know where that will end up
6436 2018-02-21 01:14:53 Bump stocks ruined accuracy God.. a real Soldier makes every bullet count.
6437 2018-02-21 01:14:50 From@what I’ve been told, it’s easy to modify without the bump stocks. Maybe it’ll appease the liberals because they think it means something.
6438 2018-02-21 01:14:43 Parody? Bump stocks aren't accurate anyway. Just a toy to fire off a lot of rounds.
6439 2018-02-21 01:14:38 Put in stocks. Like the old days.
6440 2018-02-21 01:14:29 I think right after LV there was a piece of legislation that took away assault rifles, but named like 200 individual ones. Plus bump stocks. It wasn't new.
6441 2018-02-21 01:14:23 I've seen bump stocks more like-able than @DineshDSouza
6442 2018-02-21 01:14:20 Mike piazza hall of fame voting system. Stocks put 2017 in the posts.
6443 2018-02-21 01:14:17 Obviously,  ban assault weapons, high capacity clips, bump stocks, consistent universal background checks , higher age to buy weapons, mental illness violent social media posts , won't effect most legal gun owners, common sense unless you're in NRA pocketbook.
6444 2018-02-21 01:14:08 And then what will you ask for.  I’m on board with bump stocks, enhanced juvenile background checks and making it as close to impossible to turn a trigger pull weapon to straight auto fire. Anything more!  FORGETABOUTIT!!!
6445 2018-02-21 01:14:02 Yes—Stocks were Bought—Then Sold.   All the Signs of a Short Covering Rally—That was then Sold.
6446 2018-02-21 01:14:01 You said during your campaign we wouldn't have to worry about our guns. It's a bad move to suggest banning 'bump stocks' and putting an age restriction on AR-15's. The left/Dems/Deep State want to abolish guns to make us defenseless. Protect our right to defend ourselves
6447 2018-02-21 01:13:59 My plan:

Draft GW from UConn & then trade her to LV for McBride.
Trade Coates & the other top pick from Rnd 1 to NYL for TCharles.

New Starting 5:

PG - Sloot
SG - Quigley
SF - McBride
PF - Dolson
C - Charles

* Sloot & Charles would be Top 10 players.  Good back-ups.  = Title.
6448 2018-02-21 01:13:47 #GunControlNow People say banning assault weapons and bump stocks will make the black market for them even worse.  However, the black market will never go away.  So if even one life is saved by a ban, it is worth it!
6449 2018-02-21 01:13:46 Trump banned bump stocks today...... you demoturds upset about that too?
6450 2018-02-21 01:13:42 There are so many major headlines today on #GunSafetyLaws:

- Denver banning bump stocks, having residents return them to the police
- CA winning the 10-day waiting period case
- FL denying the hearing on banning assault weapons
- The President banning semi-automaic modifiers
6451 2018-02-21 01:13:41 I've been watching. Not you but elections up and coming. I think the dems are trying to split votes for the repubs. May just be strategy. Also..bump stocks are nothing and not illegal to own yet..keep watching. Keep awake.
6452 2018-02-21 01:13:36 We aren't born yesterday. Most news chanel are not worth watching. The shadow party is upset lost money in stocks invested in wrong stocks. Hillary was suppose to win. Well we want a republic a constitution. we love you Mr. President
6453 2018-02-21 01:13:29 Don’t fuck with trump but the truth is none of you mother fuckers need bump stocks you can barley handle a .22 
6454 2018-02-21 01:13:28 Anyone own any stocks? Or interested in it?
6455 2018-02-21 01:13:28 Doesn't matter what I think - what do the richies at Mar-A-lago think? I hope they want to expand background checks, ban bump stocks and create a national gun registry.
6456 2018-02-21 01:13:27 this is what an old man full of himself looks like........ he made most of his hedge-fund fortune in 2008-9 as almost all US suffered horrific losses in Singer's "legitimate" markets of stocks/bonds/housing/jobs.......
6457 2018-02-21 01:13:22 Definitely forgot about that. Buy gun stocks after mass shootings
6458 2018-02-21 01:13:15 I need some suggestions for top 5 laughing stocks on NBA 2K18 I have 2 people already need 3 more
6459 2018-02-21 01:13:02 Tax the guns. Insurance for victim restitution, healthcare if injured, funeral expenses. Registration. Education. Trained Adult guardianship permit, after internship in a trauma unit. Ban bump stocks.  Listen to old ladies and children.
6460 2018-02-21 01:12:58 I hate Trump, but I will give credit where credit is due. I am glad he's pushing for banning bump stocks. It's not enough, but at least it's something. #bumpstocks
6461 2018-02-21 01:12:47 I’m a supporter of the president but today when he said he is pushing to ban bump stocks really hurt me because it is against our second amendment rights
6462 2018-02-21 01:12:43 It's unclear whether the ATF has the legal right to ban bump stocks. Don't you think it makes more sense for Congress to just pass a law banning them?
6463 2018-02-21 01:12:39 The police got bump stocks tho while they ride around the hood
6464 2018-02-21 01:12:36 $VPC 0.9 smoked and some. Bought a few $VPCOA on mkt at 0.3, and still holding all placement stocks + attaching options. Don’t think merchant have gone into all the trouble to make just 20%, they usually back bigger winners
6465 2018-02-21 01:12:35 You can't convert an AR to automatic because the gauge of the milled lower is too narrow to accept the trigger assembly, by design. Bump stocks never work perfectly, especially with gloves on. AR gas blocks and gas tubes usually can't take more than 4 24 round mags b4 they fail.
6466 2018-02-21 01:12:33 I am pro gun and an NRA member and these bump stocks are just dangerous toys I agree take them away.  Leave our ARs and extended magazines alone!!!
6467 2018-02-21 01:12:31 I’d suspect that over time you’d be able to trade USD for most, if not all coins. However they’ll still trade together. Similar to how US stocks have high correlation to each other.
6468 2018-02-21 01:12:09 How many bump stocks have been in the news.  As I remember only 1 in Las VEgas
6469 2018-02-21 01:12:06 SMH... @realDonaldTrump would be so much smarter to stop the russia tweets and focus on what he said about bump stocks today. @POTUS #PRteam is so bad at their jobs. But then again so is Trump.
6470 2018-02-21 01:12:05 Bump stocks should be illegal and the AR15s attached to them as well. If you are a civilian ,not in the military or police force, you only have one reason to own an automatic weapon.
6471 2018-02-21 01:11:55 Prediction:  trump will not ban bump stocks. He will claim that it’s not his fault no republicans will vote for any form of gun control.
6472 2018-02-21 01:11:52 Bump fire stocks are dumb in the first place.  I use to have one on my ARSENAL SLR-107R AK47 and the bump stocks only burns through the ammo much faster and is just a gimmick.  The anti-gunners can have the piece of shit plastic bump fire stocks if that makes them feel vindicated
6473 2018-02-21 01:11:29 Bump stocks are legal bro
6474 2018-02-21 01:11:28 I'm in the "I don't care about Romney" camp so Trump's endorsement are not isn't my concern. My worry _is_ with the bump stocks, because we now have a precedent for emotional appeal moving regulatory policy. Expect more.
6475 2018-02-21 01:11:22 Bad guys. LoL. You mean gun lovers and their kids.  It'll take comprehensive changes in all facets. Add Restrictions on purchasing weapons. Raise age limit on all gun purchases.  Full & COMPREHENSIVE background checks. Ban semi auto, bump stocks, and other conversation devices.
6476 2018-02-21 01:11:21 Uranium 1, Clinton’s getting cash. Podesta gets stocks in a Russian firm. Yeah you’re right they were so hard on Russia.
6477 2018-02-21 01:11:18 If Trump moves forward with the ban on modifying firearms (bump stocks, trigger mods, etc), it will be the beginning of his end.
6478 2018-02-21 01:10:38 U get how regulation works right? & how there are reasonable limits to the 2nd Amend. Like how you can't own a full auto weapon, or an bazooka, and that isn't "criminalizing millions of ave Americans." However people ask about bump stocks or extended mags & suddenly you lose it
6479 2018-02-21 01:10:26 Why did the Obama administration legalize bump stocks????? Please answer this.
6480 2018-02-21 01:10:21 Anderson Cooper has been on the air for 10 minutes now. He has not mentioned the fact that Bump Stocks are being banned. It's all about Russia and hatred.
6481 2018-02-21 01:10:18 Bump stocks? BFD. How about banning all assault weapons. Period. Thompson machine guns were outlawed decades ago. Why? Mass killing machine. No difference between T sub machine gun and assault weapons with large clips. This has everything to do about sane gun rights.
6482 2018-02-21 01:10:17 I don't thank him unless it's been done. Passing it off to the AG is not good enough. Also bump stocks were not used in this massacre, why is he months behind if he really wanted to do something?
6483 2018-02-21 01:10:12 Just get the consistency down. Either way there will always be a volatile market to trade. Lets talk stocks and ETFs if crypto ever becomes a snoozefest ; )
6484 2018-02-21 01:10:05 President Trump please don’t ban bump stocks it is against our second amendment rights
6485 2018-02-21 01:10:05 @realDonaldTrump first they will want the bump stocks, which are actually pretty stupid and not many serious shooters would own one, and next they want other parts and then they will want some 1994 Clinton type ban. You will lose in 2020 if you acquiesce to liberal panty waists.
6486 2018-02-21 01:10:04 if bump stocks will soon be illegal than what will happen to the millions that are in the hands of Americans already?
6487 2018-02-21 01:09:47 Bump stocks are kinda cheatibg for a law thats on the books. I have no problem with a ban.
6488 2018-02-21 01:09:41 Again only banning weapons that are so deadly that they are too dangerous for the public.  I guess you are mad the president took steps to outlaw "bump stocks" today...you should be based on your posts.
6489 2018-02-21 01:09:37 When "they" give an inch in this fight take it. Be thankful you got it. Then fight for the next one. Things will not change over night. Bump stocks make AR15's far more deadly. It's a victory.
6490 2018-02-21 01:09:32 @Guardian reports Trump's "tiny offer" on bump stocks. Actually the offer concedes everything: the link between guns & killing. #guncontrol
6491 2018-02-21 01:09:30 Seeing the results now of the eclipse smacking loads of stocks - eclipses can show effects up to one month to the day either before or after .  Remember about the cover ups ! BIG, GSW, CPH etc
6492 2018-02-21 01:09:30 So are semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, and magazines that hold too many bullets.
6493 2018-02-21 01:09:22 Exactly. The NRA has given trump the bump stocks but they were floating that after texas.
6494 2018-02-21 01:09:22 bump stocks is also what Trump does to the stock market ***APPLAUSE SIGN FLASHES***
6495 2018-02-21 01:09:19 Good grief, you act like a petulant child everytime Trump makes a decision you don't like. The NRA agreed 12 months ago that bump stocks require regulation. Romney is evil but the President is wise to support him. We don't have to. I won't.
6496 2018-02-21 01:08:59 It's BULLSHIT! Come on Bump STOCKS WERE ONLY USED IN VEGAS,REGULAR ASSAULT RIFLES WERE USED IN ALL THE REST! AND HIS WAY WILL TAKE YEARS! TAKE IT BACK! GETTING SOFT!!!!!
6497 2018-02-21 01:08:51 It's time to short on bump stocks.
6498 2018-02-21 01:08:51 Should have happened right after Vegas.  Had the most recent shooting not happened, they would have continued to ignored the bump stocks.  They are offering crumbs.
6499 2018-02-21 01:08:46 I agree bump stocks are bad for the gun. I'm saying if we give up just one 2A item that will snowball into much more. By then it's to late.
So the "Shall not be infringed" phrase is only words?
6500 2018-02-21 01:08:28 Even I think $AMZN similar to many other tech. stocks might be overpriced, you can't compare $AMZN to $WMT since $AMZN is growing rapidly in different areas (e.g. cloud computing); one should compare $WMT to an established company such as $AAPL even if it is not a retail company.
6501 2018-02-21 01:08:25 I think bump stocks are dumb. Waste of ammo and would be difficult to aim. Put a serial number on them and nfa them like full autos. If people want to pay all that money to ammo dump like a full auto then let em do it. You ban ar15’s then you open the door to ban all semi autos
6502 2018-02-21 01:08:24 this ban on bump stocks do nothing, when you can look it up and know you can bumb fire with a finger and  a belt or even a stick
6503 2018-02-21 01:08:16 More applicable is the @NRA proposals for legislation on bump stocks, DOJ can’t just impose ban
6504 2018-02-21 01:08:15 Trump made an effort to stop events like this from happening as well. Bump stocks are officially banned in America. I just want the media to focus on the people who lost their lives though. The guy in Texas had no idea if he lost friends in the church because of the media.
6505 2018-02-21 01:08:14 @realDonaldTrump accepted >$22M from NRA during campaign. 39 days in office he signed Executive Order allowing mentally ill to purchase guns. NOW he's being vocal about bump stocks? Are you F'ing kidding? Another diversion tactic! How about reversing that Executive Order too?
6506 2018-02-21 01:08:14 The only people pushing to ban bump stocks are those who don’t understand that the same effect can be achieved with an elastic band.
6507 2018-02-21 01:08:04 Oh, I think a whole lot more than just banning bump stocks needs to be done.
6508 2018-02-21 01:08:01 Fuck bump stocks (there are other devices that have the same effect including a 3d printed version). Go for the assault weapons ban & discontinue the notorious ar-15 entirely.
6509 2018-02-21 01:08:01 Hey @realDonaldTrump if you are going to regulate Bump Stocks & SIMILAR DEVICES, Wink', Wink', you have to drop two current reg's

How about #CCW #reciprocity & the outdated $200 #NFA Tax Stamp?

Please no #guncontrol but smart #CommonSenseRegulations #FloridaSchoolShooting
#2a
6510 2018-02-21 01:07:57 Trump moves to ban rapid-fire gun ‘bump stocks’...
6511 2018-02-21 01:07:54 Bump stocks need removed your correct. Also I know plenty in the Midwest who use it to take care of prairie dogs
6512 2018-02-21 01:07:43 First one is bump stocks.
6513 2018-02-21 01:07:31 2/2 env chapter world-first 2 discipline via trade sanctions those who subsidize fishing overfished stocks. No brainer? Course it is - #SDG14 says so & here in #Pacific we know it matters. It’s about real world livelihoods. #CPTPP moves beyond warm words to action.  It’s a start
6514 2018-02-21 01:07:22 They won't push for anything but a slight tightening of the registry and bump stocks. States control much of it anyhow.

Got to vote, can't let these leftist take control.
6515 2018-02-21 01:07:21 Trump spoke of a ban on bump stocks apparently
6516 2018-02-21 01:07:16 I rarely see anybody with bump stocks.  They are not used for home defense anyway.  No reason to ban them.
6517 2018-02-21 01:07:04 In general I don't see an issue with bump stocks.  They are a novelty item. Pretty much no real benefit to have one. I doubt very many gun owners will care if they are banned. Could be wrong. I won't though.
6518 2018-02-21 01:07:01 Um, but they did in Vegas. Why do people need bump stocks?
6519 2018-02-21 01:06:58 It's not about bump stocks.  It's about "giving in" when the narrative on the left is getting more and more insane.  This was not a time to concede anything, even if toothless.  Feeds their narrative IMO.
6520 2018-02-21 01:06:56 @realDonaldTrump 
We can not just say things that'll make a difference, we must do things to make a difference"
Ban bump stocks
Raise age to buy AR-15
5 days after school shooting...
Still waiting 4 Obama's gun control after Sandy Hook!
6521 2018-02-21 01:06:52 Because “bump-stocks” start school shootings...not guns, and now the people behind the guns, but bump-stocks? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!?
6522 2018-02-21 01:06:48 @realDonaldTrump You are late to the party Bump Stocks should have been addressed the day after Vegas Shooting Assault rifles of any kind have no business in the hands of anyone other than a war zone Be a man for once Do something right for others #BanAssaultWeapons
6523 2018-02-21 01:06:39 You want Obama to be @potus44 again? He’d be doing something. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump got installed by Putin. It looks like Putin gave him permission to say he’s against bump stocks.
6524 2018-02-21 01:06:32 Exactly. Also, bump stocks are an easy sacrifice because they aren’t even NECESSARY to install in order to “bump fire” a semi-automatic weapon. No tools, no accessories, and no modifications are needed to bump fire a semi.
6525 2018-02-21 01:05:35 Stocks were way over due a correction most of us new it was coming in 2018
6526 2018-02-21 01:05:31 Bump stocks are a stupid accessory anyway, they screw up the accuracy of the weapon. That's not the concern.

It's a risk anytime you cave to leftist legislative pressure, it only emboldens their hope, & it's these incrimental gains that fuel them to a total 2A repeal possibility
6527 2018-02-21 01:05:26 I was at a gun show the week following the Las Vegas shooting and lets just say the guys I talked to were not impressed by the GOP politicians talking about banning bump stocks. (The vendors were happy about the skyrocketing price they could demand for bump stocks though.)
6528 2018-02-21 01:05:07 Trump shows his outrage with a ban on bump stocks. An item used once by a deranged shooter, and something most knowledgeable gun enthusiasts would NOT even consider buying. This does nothing to solve the problem. That's why it was such an easy "concession" to make.
6529 2018-02-21 01:04:52 Bump stocks are irrelevant. They take away from accuracy. Pull rhe trigger yourself.
6530 2018-02-21 01:04:45 Yes friend it is, and does not cover bump stocks
6531 2018-02-21 01:04:36 Digging your heels in no matter what is foolish. Sometimes you have to do a little tweaking. 

Bump stocks? How many shots does one need?

18 year old can buy a gun but can't buy alcohol?

It's only going to get worse, many messed up kids and dis-engaged parents.
6532 2018-02-21 01:04:35 They want to regulate bump stocks so they don't regulate guns themselves. It isn't that hard to tell. They also don't allow the CDC to study fun violence. Why would that be? They definitely share a part of the blame.
6533 2018-02-21 01:04:30 Bump stocks do not increase rate of fire.
6534 2018-02-21 01:04:29 Accidentally clicked on yes while thumb scolling, so -1; bump stocks are not the problem, and it's a slippery slope to start blaming random gun parts rather than the perp. It's a heart problem, not the hardware. #2A #MolonLabe
6535 2018-02-21 01:04:27 President Trump proposes ban on bump stocks. News.
6536 2018-02-21 01:04:17 Good thing today he announced he wanted to an bump stocks and increase background checks....
6537 2018-02-21 01:04:15 Why do I think banning bump stocks was a calculated plan by GOP in case another mass shooting just to appease their benefactors
6538 2018-02-21 01:04:12 You may get rid of bump stocks and a few accessories that most gun enthusiasts can make themselves if they wanted to, but you won't change or get rid of the 2A and you won't infringe on it too much or you'll have an uprising on your hands. Stock up on canned goods and water!
6539 2018-02-21 01:03:54 So we are against India & bump stocks?
6540 2018-02-21 01:03:22 I actually don't care about bump stocks. They're stupid and pointless, but any ban at all of anything just encourages the gungrabbers.
6541 2018-02-21 01:03:18 trump advocates for banning bump stocks which will save AR-15 owners thousands of $$$ a year on ammo expenses at shooting ranges.
6542 2018-02-21 01:03:07 Banning bump stocks should’ve been done after Vegas. Wouldn’t have made a lick of difference here. Sure, it’s better than nothing, but pretty damned close to nothing if you ask me. #whathaveyoudoneformelately
6543 2018-02-21 01:03:04 Cool your jets. Banning bump stocks won't impact me negatively at all. If I want a real automatic, I'll just buy one. Chess.
6544 2018-02-21 01:02:52 Get real!  How unfair!  Most people don't even know what stocks they hold in there 401...and even if they did so what!!  Shame shame on you!
6545 2018-02-21 01:02:39 Lol, the best stocks always get abused.. I learned panic selling cost me tons..
6546 2018-02-21 01:02:34 And military should have the absolute best weapons. Deer hunters and general public have no need for that kind of weapon. Hunt by all means. Protect family. All possible withiut bumo stocks and AR15.
6547 2018-02-21 01:02:30 I didn't say everything was a slippery slope. I said that banning bump stocks is. It's pretty arbitrary, and it's reactionary (Las Vegas) as opposed to being a real solution to any future problem. That said, it isn't the worst idea I've heard.
6548 2018-02-21 01:02:22 BUMP STOCKS

6549 2018-02-21 01:02:03 "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau." - Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University, 1929.
6550 2018-02-21 01:01:53 Former President Obama legalized bump stocks, while President Trump is banning bump stocks. You’d think the media would report that, but it doesn’t fit their anti-gun narrative they are perpetuating in order to elect Democrats in the midterms.
6551 2018-02-21 01:01:51 Its dumber to think this reinvestment into business has yielded gains for the average person in the united states. There is a main street disconnect- most stocks are owned by few people, who reap the benfits as the poor die of no healthcare the conpanies are profiting from
6552 2018-02-21 01:01:51 Give them the bump stocks!
6553 2018-02-21 01:01:24 Only semi-automatics are legal, one trigger pull per bullet
 Bump stocks make firing much faster.. close to "automatic" or "machine gun" rate
6554 2018-02-21 01:01:18 You’re upset about bump stocks and keeping Romney in his back pocket?  I voted for a guy to get shit done.  I’m good.
6555 2018-02-21 01:00:56 Then propose a bill that bans bump stocks and ONLY bump stocks. No filler crap. No pork. No strings attached. ONLY bump stocks.
6556 2018-02-21 01:00:47 The Dems had control under Obama to ban bump stocks, and they didn't
6557 2018-02-21 01:00:40 It's taken over a year, but if he does ban bump stocks, this would be his first good move.
6558 2018-02-21 01:00:33 Definitely disappointed with pullback in #Metals today... Still think Gold $GC_F, Silver $SI_F, Platinum $PL_F, & Copper $HG_F have more upside in 2018. *I was surprised Gold was sooo weak today... would have thought even with the fake bid in USD, flight to safety on weak stocks.
6559 2018-02-21 01:00:31 Bump stocks can go- makes fire rate similar to auto.  Would also be OK to make purchase age 21 like handguns.
6560 2018-02-21 01:00:24 #CNN #MSNBC Trump signs "Memo" telling Congress to look into new"Rules" for Bump Stocks. As for AR15's, only <crickets> , no bans, no rules, no legislation. #hardball #maddow
6561 2018-02-21 01:00:14 ...banning bump stocks is hardly caving, it's needed, w/ you on Mitt tho, not a fan even if and probably smart for Trump to endorse in the grand scheme.
6562 2018-02-21 01:00:11 I’m sorry to hear that @voxman77  The NRA supports exactly what Trump is doing & no rules have been changed. Have faith in Trump he won’t let anyone take away guns. He’s only looking at certain bump stocks...read the Federal Register. I posted a link.
6563 2018-02-21 01:00:07 Funny thing is, it would be another reversal of Obama policy because bump stocks were approved by his regime.
6564 2018-02-21 01:00:07 “The ump was terrible”
6565 2018-02-21 00:59:57 It's sorta like a hurricane pantry--everyone stocks up.

They'll be on gunbroker in a month.
6566 2018-02-21 00:59:54 And the same can be said for the teams in the NBA.

Bird & McHale
Magic & Kareem
Thomas & Dumars
Jordan & Pippen
Hakeem & Drexler
Shaq & Kobe
Duncan & Parker
Curry & Durant

Top 10 talent in the Starting Lineup is the common denominator.

The Bulls & Sky have work left to do!!!
6567 2018-02-21 00:59:49 So let me gets this straight Obama approves bumps stocks and now President Trump bans them and Trump is the bad guy?
6568 2018-02-21 00:59:47 You're right. Stuff it @realDonaldTrump shouldn't bother banning bump stocks after all since he is only going to get criticised for trying to take a step in the right direction. 
6569 2018-02-21 00:59:46 Donald Trump Directs Justice Department To Take Steps To Ban Bump Stocks: President Donald Trump announced he has…
6570 2018-02-21 00:59:28 As a gun owner I am sick of you people justifying AR15's and bump stocks. There is nothing wrong with owning a gun, there is something wrong with owning weapons of war. Remember that 2nd amendment isn't absolute, that is why you can't own a machine gun. Go back to Fox now.
6571 2018-02-21 00:59:26 So the PR he's getting re: bump stocks is all BS ?

Thanks Jali_Cat !!! 

Good to know that the "President" is pretending to make law today ...
6572 2018-02-21 00:59:17 Trump cannot ban bump stocks of his own accord. It's unconstitutional.
6573 2018-02-21 00:59:12 Then we  should ban bump stocks not the gun.
6574 2018-02-21 00:59:03 @POTUS So you ordered a ban on bump stocks? When the anti gun extremists figure out all you need is a shoe lace or rubber band the will demand a ban on semiautomatics. BTW a bump stock an automatic does not make. @WilkowMajority
6575 2018-02-21 00:59:02 Cool, but you know bump stocks weren’t used in #Parkland right? I mean don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased to hear you’re trying to ban bump stocks. But a lot more needs to happen if we are to protect school kids. If you won’t act, its time for the #IL14 to elect someone who will.
6576 2018-02-21 00:58:55 Why do we need bump stocks tho
6577 2018-02-21 00:58:50 Bump stocks actually make accuracy of weapon worst , so maybe it's a good thing ? lol
6578 2018-02-21 00:58:41 I am fine with banning bum[ stocks.
6579 2018-02-21 00:58:40 Trump's reaction today regarding bump stocks is a direct result of - not just left wingers wanting these banned - but some right wingers willing to compromise and put banning on the table. You think Trump won't look at the deal presented to him? This is why you don't compromise.
6580 2018-02-21 00:58:09 #DelhiChiefSecretary #DalalStreet  we expect Bearish Phase 2 continue ,investors have lost confidence in Public Sector Banks ,investors stay away from Nationalised banks ,traders keep trading these wretched STOCKS
6581 2018-02-21 00:58:02 If that's the case then I was wrong. I just have a thing about bump stocks.
6582 2018-02-21 00:57:59 Why wasn’t this proposed last OCTOBER!?!? Bump stocks won’t get banned. HE ACCEPTED 30 million dollars from the NRA in 2016. He spoke at their conference. He said that he is a friend of the NRA. You kids need to get organized on registering to vote!
6583 2018-02-21 00:57:57 Then why did you and the ATF approve bump-stocks which was used in the Vegas shooting? Clarification please #GunControl
6584 2018-02-21 00:57:51 Bump stocks aren't guns or gun control. Full automatics are already banned so might as well ban the kits to make guns full auto.
6585 2018-02-21 00:57:39 Your legislation contains much more than bump stocks !

You going to change it ?
6586 2018-02-21 00:57:23 Again: That is the point. You make laws more restrictive. No bump stocks. No semi. No 18-21 yr. old purchasing a weapon. All weapons removed from domestic abusers. (Not just future purchases but also previous ones) No personal sales, including gun shows. It's just not hard.
6587 2018-02-21 00:57:23 Bro Trump announced he was going to ban bump stocks like 3 hours ago
6588 2018-02-21 00:57:13 No one is paying attention.  Trump just says stuff, but Congress ignores it, or Congress says stuff and Trump ignores it. That is why everything is a mess! And then they both say they "tried".  The bump stocks are not recognized by the ATF as a weapon....
6589 2018-02-21 00:57:11 Lobbying the government to make it easier for "bad guys" with guns to kill "good guys" with bump stocks and semi automatic assault rifles is why the #NRAIsATerroristOrganization and why the youth of #ParklandStrong will #KilltheNRA
6590 2018-02-21 00:57:11 No bump stocks were used in Fl. I'll give up bump stocks for national concealed carry, and suppressor legislation.
6591 2018-02-21 00:57:09 Mr. Pres good work on over regulation, economy ,ban bump stocks? Trying 2 provide sane border and immigration protections that every other modern country provide thier citizens. Legal immigration is a great thing, very different than illegal, we know the difference, stay focused.
6592 2018-02-21 00:57:01 I already give you snacks before d: I should keep the snack stocks for the others 
6593 2018-02-21 00:56:59 It's a trick, can't believe anyone still falls for them. Bump stocks weren't involved in Parkland or Sandy Hook, just Las Vegas and nothing was done then. It's a useless executive order designed to con the low info gullible.
6594 2018-02-21 00:56:57 Trump and his minions and the NRA will have a full assault on these kids and do something like ban bump stocks and claim they did something. Republicans are paid for by corporations to represent their interests. Period.
6595 2018-02-21 00:56:55 You still haven't replied to why you want to ban bump stocks....
6596 2018-02-21 00:56:54 For years while people have been high-fiving each other over a stock market where the top10% over 85% of the stocks, where 50% don't hold any, where nearly all the wealth accumulation has been from owning assets not from wages, household debt has reached record levels.
6597 2018-02-21 00:56:52 He won’t. Memo to ban bump stocks. They’re junk anyway. All weapons must meet ATF regs. So many American parts etc! Don’t need full auto!!!
6598 2018-02-21 00:56:37 Bump stocks ban was so 4 months ago
6599 2018-02-21 00:56:19 These kids are crying out to the president to do something, and what does he do, ban bumper stocks, which is a damn Las Vegas mass shooting issue. Has NOTHING to do with Parkland, FL. What a piece of work! @RealDonad_Trump
6600 2018-02-21 00:56:17 The teams w/ Top 10 WNBA Players, in their Starting Lineups, are the one's winning titles.  Case in pt...

Minnesota has Moore & Fowles
Phoenix has Taurasi & Griner
Los Angeles has Parker & Ogwumike
Seattle had Bird & Jackson
Houston had Cooper, Swoopes & Thompson

CHI has none.
6601 2018-02-21 00:56:15 #shitholePOTUS is not doing anything courageous by banning bump stocks as NRA gave green light after Vegas that they were ok with the ban #spinelessGOP courageous would be if GOP gave back NRA donations and ban AR15
6602 2018-02-21 00:55:57 Great call on banning bump stocks! @realDonaldTrump
6603 2018-02-21 00:55:54 Great spot as always Mouse! $4ce and other quality Li stocks have provided beautiful entry points....market sentiment is all but guaranteed to return to the sector soon. 

Typical buy the lows sell the highs...
6604 2018-02-21 00:55:50 Sure ban bump stocks. Who cares? Guess what? If you really want one you just need a 3D printer. Same with extended magazines. So if you are crazy enough to plan a mass shooting you can still make it happen. 

So maybe we should think of some real solutions? 
#MAGA
6605 2018-02-21 00:55:45 There are so many restrictions and taxes for alcohol. No one complains. Yet if there is one mention of putting one tiny restriction on firearms (bump stocks), NRA goes nuts.
6606 2018-02-21 00:55:43 Bump stocks are only one type if device, there are multiple types as well as a device that can be 3d printed, but fuck that. Go after the ar-15 itself. That weapon should be discontinued.
6607 2018-02-21 00:55:36 Any #StockTraders give me a like and follow 
Also message me some stocks to check out ill let you know what I think.

@StockTwits @RobinhoodApp @etrade @Investingcom
6608 2018-02-21 00:55:28 Unlikely. Buying bonds for the yield is like buying stocks for dividend yield. Sure the yield is higher, but if they keep rising, you are incurring capital losses.
6609 2018-02-21 00:55:18 Vitally important everybody, regardless of political affiliation, gets behind @realDonaldTrump to ban bump stocks and impose an age restriction on purchase of assault type weapons. These are small steps, but small steps forward.
6610 2018-02-21 00:55:18 What did President Obama do?  Shouldn't Obama have banned bump stocks before Las Vegas so this wouldn't even be an issue for Trump and the Justice Department?
6611 2018-02-21 00:55:14 Bump stocks were proposed 4 mos ago after Las  Vegas
6612 2018-02-21 00:55:10 I don’t care about bump stocks, but what good did this do? It seems like a cheap concession, a hollow victory. It changes absolutely nothing.
6613 2018-02-21 00:55:09 I agree.  Bump stocks should be illegal.
6614 2018-02-21 00:55:06 Nobody cares about bump stocks that’s why he said ban them
6615 2018-02-21 00:54:52 He gets no credit. I see him. Banning of bump stocks was suppose to happen months ago. It didn’t. So now, in order to avoid discussion about banning assault rifles, he’s throwing this red meat out. F#ck that. We want both banned!  #neveragain
6616 2018-02-21 00:54:43 This is a purposefully misleading statement. The Obama administration enforced the law, which did not ban the manufacture of bump stocks. In enforcing the law, the language did not ban bump stocks. The admin policy was not supportive of them.
6617 2018-02-21 00:54:40 Side note, Bump stocks like the one used in Vegas will be outlawed (or at least heavily restricted soon). That is change I can support.
6618 2018-02-21 00:54:38 Wife and I disagree on bump stocks.

According to Twitter, this means we are now divorced.
6619 2018-02-21 00:54:32 Plus there are untold numbers of bump stocks already sold and everywhere.  They really are worthless for any accuracy or control.  I don't own one and don't want one but I have fired an AR with one, waste of ammo.  I'm not against banning them but the milk is already spilled.
6620 2018-02-21 00:54:31 When our government can't even find the backbone to ban bump stocks, but they can find the time to give generous give backs to the rich. Hail our Dear Leader who shoots blanks.
6621 2018-02-21 00:54:22 gotta learn how to hold onto these stocks
6622 2018-02-21 00:54:11 It's just a show, to make us think he's doing something. Banning bump stocks wouldn't have saved a single one of the 17. He must think we're stupid.
6623 2018-02-21 00:54:02 @samches  another thought they said the ban was shot down, I would suggest introducing a different bill making it ILLEGAL to own assault weapons and paraphanelia, bump stocks, etc.
this is different then a ban, a ban will just prevent further sales.
6624 2018-02-21 00:54:01 We should've bought stocks in @JustForMen
6625 2018-02-21 00:53:57 I just heard @realDonaldTrump just say he wants to outlaw Bump stocks. I hope he realizes that he is infringing on our 2A and can be voted out in 2020 for doing so. We voted you in to protect our rights not infringe upon them.
6626 2018-02-21 00:53:48 What I want to know is, why does 45 need to "take steps" about Bump Stocks? Thought his Executive Order was way strong? #CravenPresident #Vote2018
6627 2018-02-21 00:53:37 They do not fight against smart gun control.Thats your label.Coming to the table to discuss this with people that always assume the worst intentions is tiresome. 

People have no use for Bump Stocks IMO. NRA wanted further restrictions on it by ATF. Dems poisoned a similar bill
6628 2018-02-21 00:53:30 The problem is this won't stop at bump stocks. "All devices" will have a very broad interpretation. Triggers will be next, then magazines, then you might as well go ahead and repeal the whole thing. Even if it's extremely specific and to the letter, liberals will keep whittling.
6629 2018-02-21 00:53:22 @reaIDonaldTrunp thanks for banning bump stocks, my nigga !!!!
6630 2018-02-21 00:53:18 Jesus you are negative on anything he touches. Good god. Stop looking for the negative if he get bump stocks banned you won't give him any credit would you.
6631 2018-02-21 00:53:17 Maybe if Fleshlight made tactical rifle stocks people could just fuck their guns already and leave the rest of society alone.
6632 2018-02-21 00:52:55 Also found legally purchased bump stocks. All info is on Google please do some research. But that is not what you are paid to do.
6633 2018-02-21 00:52:52 Boy I hope those Florida legislators are armed because I think these kids coming to see them are real mad and mean business......congressmen better break out those bump stocks..lock and load.... per The NRA...
6634 2018-02-21 00:52:21 En lo del los bump stocks estoy d acuerdo y también sobre el funcionamiento d la democracia así que ya veremos!!
6635 2018-02-21 00:52:18 NEWS ALERT | President #Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in #LasVegas massacre (The Associated Press)
6636 2018-02-21 00:52:16 I'm going too. Just waiting for the right timing. Waiting on some inheritance money (never had anything given to me like that) my Oma passed away last month and left some stocks, bonds and a CD. For the first time in my life I could up and go anywhere and live.
6637 2018-02-21 00:52:14 No other president banned bump stocks.
6638 2018-02-21 00:52:13 You limit capacity, you ban mods, you ban bump stocks.

Hopefully your not including semi automatic as assault weapons.

Reason farmers, need those up to 10 rnds because predators such as Coyote, Wolf, bear, Bob cat, lynx, & others that can attack the farmers only means to live.
6639 2018-02-21 00:52:08 Look at him still trying to throw Obama under the bus for bump stocks. He has zero personal accountability.
6640 2018-02-21 00:52:01 This guy said “I trade stocks” and Dev thought he said “I trade socks” 
6641 2018-02-21 00:51:59 It is not enough. 17 kids were murdered, not by bump stocks. Ban assault rifles. All of them.
6642 2018-02-21 00:51:58 Bump Stocks?
6643 2018-02-21 00:51:53 No, it doesn't. And anyone with working hands and fingers can bump-fire. The commenters here are much more honest than this article and demonstrate that this isn't about bump stocks. It's about gun bans and gun grabs. Take them at their word.
6644 2018-02-21 00:51:52 Sorry, but banning bump stocks is not nearly enough! How about banning ALL firearms!
6645 2018-02-21 00:51:51 Leave bump stocks alone! Slippery slope to gun control@realDonaldTrump
6646 2018-02-21 00:51:44 Interestingly enough - I witnessed an employee showing another her annual #Gains at TSP from our recent mailing.

Culture differences? IDK 

Does the same individual change #MO when stocks underperform the #Gfund ?

Prolly not 
6647 2018-02-21 00:51:44 We gave an inch long ago and they took that mile the next second. Now we’re slowly pushing back to where we were. Let them have bump stocks. Improve doctors rights to go to DOJ/LEO and ask for a temporary confiscation until court. Enforce current background checks, unlike Obama.
6648 2018-02-21 00:51:39 Yep. Our country would fall to the back of the pack. According to the media they are looking to ban bump stocks. The FL legislators shot down the proposed ban on 'assault rifles.' It's definitely an issue to watch closely (while expanding gun collection).
6649 2018-02-21 00:51:27 Interesting; I didn't know that.

Personally I'm not big on bump-stocks....not that I ever used one.  But, all things considered, I think I lean more towards "Meh" about banning them.

Everybody is welcome to argue against me on this, though.
6650 2018-02-21 00:51:19 Dems need to join President Trump to Outlaw bump stocks.
6651 2018-02-21 00:51:12 POTUS/Congress can ban bump stocks all they want. #NikolasCruz didn’t use one at #Parkland and still managed to kill 17 people. 

So, yeah, bump stocks are bad, but that solves nothing.
6652 2018-02-21 00:51:09 Trump wants to ban bump stocks. That's a start I guess. I believe in banning guns in general like other countries. The sad thing is that that won't stop the bloodshed. It's mental health. If someone really wants to kill people they'll find another way.
6653 2018-02-21 00:51:08 Minimum 30 days in the stocks
6654 2018-02-21 00:51:06 You are wrong, Mark. Fully automatic guns are illegal. Please explain why "fully automatic" guns with bump stocks should be legal? I agree with the "embolden" part, but we have to stay rational, which I think President Trump is doing.
6655 2018-02-21 00:51:05 Putting a ban on "bump stocks" is a foot in the door to ban other accessories, guns and ammo. 

Just say'n!
6656 2018-02-21 00:50:58 Yes. If adults can't stop gun violence at schools, hopefully the teenagers whose friends died in front of them can start the process. They are scared and they are pissed! I am on their side, no one needs an AR-15 or a bump stocks.
6657 2018-02-21 00:50:57 It would require Congressional action in order to avoid court challenges to ATF’s enforcement since its not within the scope of ATF’s powers as bump stocks are not “guns,” is why this is an easy proposal for Trump to make knowing it likely won’t come to fruition w/ GOP in control
6658 2018-02-21 00:50:57 I'm willing to listen. I'm against bump stocks, and for strong mental health screenings and full background checks as I mentioned. But blanket bans on guns i'm most likely not going to be for. I'm for tougher laws where they make sense.
6659 2018-02-21 00:50:51 not a bad thing.
No reason to have bump stocks.
Anything that turns a semi auto to a fully auto is not good
6660 2018-02-21 00:50:45 @realDonaldTrump   Getting warmer...great on banning bump stocks.  Now ban assault rifles!  Offer to buy them back!  I bet there are a TON of people who will gladly trade ‘em in!  Do it!  Make History!
6661 2018-02-21 00:50:44 "Hello Mr LaPierre?  Don Trump here.  My I please have permission to ban Bump Stocks?  You see, they are the only way I can get these Kids and American Public off my back....  Pretty please, Mr LaPierre"
6662 2018-02-21 00:50:43 I vaguely remember hearing that.
Bump stocks don’t kill AR 15’s kill
6663 2018-02-21 00:50:38 For real, stocks are like horses in horse races.
6664 2018-02-21 00:50:37 Agreed. The bump stocks ban is window dressing so Trump can say he did something. It’s not enough.
6665 2018-02-21 00:50:31 Good to know that Trump is taking a cue and moving to ban bump stocks. But the problem is, a bump stocks was, as far as we know, only used in the Vegas shooting. This ban wouldn't have saved anyone in Parkland, Orlando, Aurora, or Sandy Hook. There's a lot more to change.
6666 2018-02-21 00:50:23 Bump stocks they can do in their sleep.  Not enough.
But it’s a start considering Dems let it go after not clamoring for it after @DianneFeinstein introduced it.
Dems need to learn how to buck up.
6667 2018-02-21 00:50:13 When future generation will look back they won't be able to comprehend why civilians used bump stocks to begin with.
6668 2018-02-21 00:50:11 You cracked it, Rick.
6669 2018-02-21 00:50:08 At least the Bill addressed the problem. Not Bump Stocks.
6670 2018-02-21 00:50:07 Bump stocks are junk anyways
6671 2018-02-21 00:50:06 I heard that bump stocks need to be legislated, not through administration or executive action.  Renders this inadequate even for bump stocks. Maybe someone knows more?
6672 2018-02-21 00:50:00 #bumpstocks "Trump asks Justice Department to ban bump stocks and other gun modifications"

Hang on...ban...guns? Wasn't Trump saying "Your Second Amendment is protected with me as president" at a rally? -_-
6673 2018-02-21 00:49:59 Automatic weapons are already illegal. And Trump is going over turn the Obama signed law that made bump stocks legal.
6674 2018-02-21 00:49:59 What trump doesn't understand is that "bump stocks" aren't going to cut it. We want better gun legislation all across the board. Bump stocks are just the beginning - #BanAssaultWeapons
6675 2018-02-21 00:49:57 Looking at a little green in those stocks ath
6676 2018-02-21 00:49:56 @EricTrump Why is @POTUS banning bump stocks without getting something like suppressors or national reciprocity in return?

Shouldn't the 2nd Amendment get something positive passed into law for once?
6677 2018-02-21 00:49:48 Exactly. And bump stocks are crap anyway.
6678 2018-02-21 00:49:28 We need more than just a ban on bump stocks #bumpstocks #GunReformNow
6679 2018-02-21 00:49:14 Hey @realDonaldTrump nice jesture,  but this time it's about a complete assault weapons ban! Bump stocks was the last mass shooting... #MSDStrong #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
6680 2018-02-21 00:48:57 #2: the ATF has already ruled that "bump stocks"  are legal. Please do not mis-represent either the points or, the President.
6681 2018-02-21 00:48:56 Cool. Now ban AR15s, bump stocks, large capacity magazines. Pass "No fly no buy," and "red flag weapons confiscation."
6682 2018-02-21 00:48:52 Now you care about bump stocks? Months after the massacre in Vegas?

You're just afraid of losing your semi automatic weapons, and are offering something less in exchange.
6683 2018-02-21 00:48:50 The AG doesn't have the legal authority to ban bump stocks. Trump doesn't deserve anything for such a meaningless gesture.
6684 2018-02-21 00:48:47 What did bump stocks have to do with anything in the first place. Also if you mention the Vegas shooting. Then you have no education on bump stocks. This will solve nothing. But I guess it will appease the left. They wanted something. They got nothing.
6685 2018-02-21 00:48:44 This is why I don't believe the father's call for a ban on bump stocks will ever happen. This family is hideous.
6686 2018-02-21 00:48:43 Never said or inferred that Obama endorsed bump stocks, only pointing out that they became legal for you to buy under his administration. Is that not true?
6687 2018-02-21 00:48:43 Most likely yeah
6688 2018-02-21 00:48:38 @DonaldJTrumpJr Why is your dad giving away bump stocks and age restrictions on rifle purchases for nothing in return? If bump stocks are going to be banned, why can't suppressors be unbanned?
6689 2018-02-21 00:48:37 This is the way I look at it as well.  The bump stocks are crap anyways
6690 2018-02-21 00:48:33 Tell her stocks are running low 
6691 2018-02-21 00:47:46 Pres Trump Just blinked! Banning Bump Stocks nothing,Ppl substitute easily!It’s beginning,once give 1 thing up,will start on next!Lk Privilg
6692 2018-02-21 00:47:43 Let them have the bone. Those bump stocks can be made by materials that you have in your home.
6693 2018-02-21 00:47:32 Will be interesting to watch how people react to what Trump is doing with bump stocks and such.
6694 2018-02-21 00:47:24 That ship has sailed. Now we want a ban on all assault weapons "Bump Stocks". I plan on marching with these kids! #GunContolNow
6695 2018-02-21 00:47:15 @realDonaldTrump
The longest journey begins with a single step. Congratulations on moving to ban bump stocks. Carpe diem Mr. President. Stand up to the NRA.
6696 2018-02-21 00:47:10 Throw them a bone to shut them up. Not a gun person but from what I hear bump stocks are garbage anyway.
6697 2018-02-21 00:47:06 You need to seriously get over yourself. People are suffering. Focus on that. Your proposed ban on bump stocks is a step in the right direction. We need more of that.
6698 2018-02-21 00:46:48 Bump stocks are silly. They rarely work more than 3 shots and they hurt your shoulder. Good riddance.
6699 2018-02-21 00:46:45 banning bump fire stocks is like an analogy to some other thing that does not begin to address any problem of any kind. It's NRA sleight of hand.
6700 2018-02-21 00:46:37 DOJ/ATF can not regulate non weapons I.e.  bump stocks. It has to be legislated so it’s a little trick to look like you’re doing something when no one is doing anything.
6701 2018-02-21 00:46:37 Neither just correcting your facts. You make it seem like Obama endorsed them. He did not. Bump stocks weren’t part of the conversation until Vegas massacre.  Unless you’re a gun enthusiast you had no idea what one even was until just a few months ago.
6702 2018-02-21 00:46:36 Very interesting gonna look further into this one. NYHC a profitable company do you know?
Very nice looking find here Papa
6703 2018-02-21 00:46:24 Leading to two options.

Either:
• "Reinterpret" the National Firearms Act to include regulating bump stocks and all things similar, whether or not they alter the guns internal mech.
• Or pass an actual law to simply ban Bump Stocks.
6704 2018-02-21 00:46:20 Turns out, he can’t. Just heard on @chucktodd show that bump stocks are not covered under Federal Firearms regulations. We will need actual legislation to get it done. In this GOP House ? Nope.
6705 2018-02-21 00:46:00 I was sitting in the car repair place this AM listening to the news discuss a local school with upped security because of a Snapchat threat of someone with an AR-15 captioned "Florida round 2". Shit has GOT TO CHANGE and while banning bump stocks is a good step it is insufficient
6706 2018-02-21 00:45:58 When you see that your stocks have been doing amazing, so you’re doing amazing 
6707 2018-02-21 00:45:46 Where in the constitution does it say you have the right to bump stocks?
#GunControl #GunControlNow
6708 2018-02-21 00:45:34 @realDonaldTrump I don't own a bump stock and never will. I'm perfectly happy with my regular old semi auto but it will start with bump stocks then something else. They will keep chipping away at the 2nd Amendment until there is nothing left. Expected more from you Mr. President
6709 2018-02-21 00:45:33 The shooting only happened last weej and the president immediately took action banning bump stocks and will take action on school safety!
6710 2018-02-21 00:45:24 Also, please explain how @POTUS @realDonaldTrump taking action to ban bump stocks is #FakeNews?
6711 2018-02-21 00:45:13 Trump moves to outlaw 'bump stocks,' considers other steps after Florida shooting
6712 2018-02-21 00:45:12 Banning bump stocks is a good start, but how about you actually ban the actual GUNS aka automatic and semi automatic weapons #GunControlNow #BanAR15 #GunReformNow
6713 2018-02-21 00:44:42 are you kidding? Empty ploy...this was about bump stocks!
6714 2018-02-21 00:44:36 @POTUS Why are you stabbing gun owners in the back?  Directing the DOJ to ban bump stocks without laws passed by Congress.  Are you kidding me Mr. President?  Very Disappointing?  Gun owners will remember your lack of strength on gun rights.
6715 2018-02-21 00:44:34 Trump relented on Bump Stocks something he should have done after Vegas. He doesn’t want to understand that what we want is a ban on ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS! I hope these kids hold onto this like a dog with a bone. Maybe they can do what we could not. #GunContolNow #MarchForOurLives
6716 2018-02-21 00:44:01 Yea coz bump stocks r def protected by 2a
6717 2018-02-21 00:43:57 Stick to your system and your edge will play out 

Although I’ve got $A2m we have all had those stocks when we have got our two early 
6718 2018-02-21 00:43:56 Problem solved!  But leftists just want to ban guns, dont give a damn about the real problem .. Now Trump is going along, wants to ban bump stocks, he said they convert rifles to automatic weapons.. .
6719 2018-02-21 00:43:53 Evil black gun owner/builder here...bump stocks are stupid. Ban away,  please.
6720 2018-02-21 00:43:51 Does outlawing bump stocks really hurt anyone? No, they can be made, if necessary to use against a Dem Socialist-Marxists gov take over. Just think, if Veneusula had a 2nd, they would not be eating thier pets!
6721 2018-02-21 00:43:46 I agree that nobody really needs bump stocks. I do disagree with more gun laws that won't solve real problems. If you give the libs an inch they will take a mile. Before you know it, they'll have taken the #2A.
6722 2018-02-21 00:43:44 Also, let me give credit where it is due. Trump just instructed the DoJ to push for bans on bump stocks and other such modifications to rifles to increase firing rapidity.  That is a good first step!
6723 2018-02-21 00:43:43 This is not new. All the stocks where these guys are there is naked shorted beyond recovery.
6724 2018-02-21 00:43:42 this is wrong.  there are many semi automatic rifles that cannot and do not use bump stocks.  only AR15-style rifles can use them.
6725 2018-02-21 00:43:38 Watching @RepTimRyan stumble over what should be done with gun violence, the guy means well but let's make it simple:  1. Ban on all assault rifles.  2. Universal background checks.  3. Ban on all bump stocks. There. You're welcome. #Enough #NeverAgain.
6726 2018-02-21 00:43:37 @POTUS taking executive action to ban bump stocks via the dept of justice sets a scary precident. Next Dem Pres will go for the 2A jugular. 

#VoteThemOut2018
6727 2018-02-21 00:43:28 sure bump stocks are an issue with semi auto guns but its still possible to bump fire without the stock. the problem is still just guns
6728 2018-02-21 00:43:27 "After Florida Shooting, Trump Calls For New Regulations On Bump Stocks"

A little late to the party, there, bud!
6729 2018-02-21 00:43:21 @maddow First he came for bump stocks, then your AR-15...

#TrumpIsComingForYourGuns
6730 2018-02-21 00:43:19 And, by the way, these "bump stocks" were legal in the Obama administration.  Irony, sweet irony.
6731 2018-02-21 00:43:18 No one cares about Bump Stocks. Its not a gun control move; its just a stupid accessory that no one cares about and you can make your own basically. Its easy to be a pundit and not having the whole country bearing down on you.
6732 2018-02-21 00:43:09 Telling Sessions to "come up with something" to ban bump stocks doesn't mean anything suggested will get considered, let alone passed. Also, remember Trump's style is to "say yes before saying no."
6733 2018-02-21 00:42:59 Sadly the house probably won't allow this. The domestic arms industry owns too much of the gop but i do remember the nra themselves coming out against bump stocks after LV.
6734 2018-02-21 00:42:56 Bump stocks don't turn AR-15s into machine guns.
6735 2018-02-21 00:42:52 No you can infer.  :) I don’t think either a EXO would stand up on bump stocks either.  The best way is in the branch that has the power to create laws.  Except they are spineless jackasses
6736 2018-02-21 00:42:47 $thds Thanks papa stocks for another loser.. lol, yeah pump and dump as usual, but actually the company has a great product.. too bad it's not got the recognition it deserves.
6737 2018-02-21 00:42:46 If you're a fabricator, you can build an automatic rifle from scratch.  Having bump stocks, any idiot can make a sloppy automatic AR.  I own a DPMS Oracle base gun with mods, and I think bump stocks are stupid.  Not to mention, they're a novelty and useless for accuracy.
6738 2018-02-21 00:42:45 You say you have a bill to stop bump stocks.  Then why did you stop a bill after Las Vegas to do the same by pushing all sorts of extras into it so that it couldn't pass?  Tell the truth for once.  #LyingDick
6739 2018-02-21 00:42:39 WHY IS TRUMP ASKING TO BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW AFTER BEING SILENT ALL THIS TIME? BECAUSE HE IS SCARED TO DEATH OF THE WALLS CLOSING IN ON HIM  AND HIS BULLSHIT FAMILY AND CABINET.    MUELLER IS COMING AND TRUMP IS THE TARGET
6740 2018-02-21 00:42:35 Instead of complaining about @POTUS @realDonaldTrump taking steps to ban bump stocks, you should be rejoicing that he is taking action. The @BarackObama administration twice approved the sale of bump fire stocks. This fact is verified true by @PolitiFact.
6741 2018-02-21 00:42:26 Debate is debate! To have a favorable outcome EACH SIDE needs to take their lumps! THE LEFT LOSES CAUSE WE KEEP OUR GUNS AND WE LOSE CAUSE WE GIVE UP BUMP STOCKS and AR 14s! IT LOOKS LIKE a WIN FOR OUR SIDE! I know there are many GUN owners who disagree with me but thats debate!
6742 2018-02-21 00:42:04 Bump stocks turn (along with another mod) semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons.

Which is fucking dumb to hunt with all that & 30 rnds  (Rnds = Rounds, Mod = Modification)

You could get me to Understand 10 rnd clip but never Turn a Semiautomatic to fully automatic.
6743 2018-02-21 00:42:04 No mention, of the bans he wants to be placed on bump stocks, I would expect nothing less from ABC news
6744 2018-02-21 00:41:54 Agree with both of you-and disagree. Amazon first provides a service, arguably like crypto. It's the valuation method (like internet stocks) that I question.

How, how much, and when will we see profits.
6745 2018-02-21 00:41:48 @repcharliedent calling for a ban on bump stocks is a hedge. The bump stocks make a regular gun fire like an assault weapon. Get of the fence. Take a stand. You're leaving Congress call for an assault weapons ban.
6746 2018-02-21 00:41:39 @POTUS ... women to handle in a defense situation. Concealed carry needs to be passed for all 50 states equally. Those who are responsible adults shouldn't be left to be victims if they are traveling from each state to another! Bump stocks are a fun item use only so I have no ...
6747 2018-02-21 00:41:22 Almost a week since the school shooting in Flordia that killed 17 people, President Trump plans to ban "bump stocks", or devices that enhance semi-automatic guns.
6748 2018-02-21 00:41:19 a ban on bump stocks would be a good step to help save lives.
however, death tolls could still be dozens high with semi-auto weapons in public shooting incidences, just as they were in florida, vtech, and sandy hook.
hopefully, this can start a movement on gun control
6749 2018-02-21 00:41:14 Wrong.
He will get the full mileage on it.

The good part is that bump stocks are worthless throw-away gimmicks for most shooters.  There is absolutely no accuracy with a bump stock.  We make the long shots---the sissies spray and pray.
6750 2018-02-21 00:41:11 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'
6751 2018-02-21 00:41:10 Well, to me. He said and meant to ban bump stocks and any device that makes a legal gun, illegal. What Congress does or doesn't do; I won't blame Trump. Do you blame Obama for Congress not passing his agenda?
6752 2018-02-21 00:41:03 Exponential TRADING is not in any book or open trading topic, It was invented to SAVE losing trades, It can be used in any index, currency, or in $DAX $SPX, etc, or stocks using perhaps options or ETFs, or combination, 

BETTER in EUROPEAN TRADING FORMAT
6753 2018-02-21 00:41:02 @RealTrump2016 so I guess the Vegas massacre wasn't enough to ban the bump stocks then?  You spineless fool!  Ban all assault weapons!
6754 2018-02-21 00:40:51 Bump stocks? You're worried about a piece of plastic that makes a gun less accurate? It's nothing!
6755 2018-02-21 00:40:47 @DonaldJTrumpJr Why is your dad directing the DOJ to ban bump stocks?  Stabbing gun owners in the back and being weak on gun rights is poor politics.  Please ask him to stop.  Very disappointing!!
6756 2018-02-21 00:40:44 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Resist the call from the gun control weirdos and cowards that politicize kids deaths for political gain! Anti-2nd Amendment speakers and politicians have neither authority nor credibility. Don't ban bump stocks! Release the Trump stock!
6757 2018-02-21 00:40:18 That’s simple. Banning bump stocks is not nearly enough.  It’s an appeasement of the American public.  Per QU polls, 67% of the American public want assaults weapons BANNED.  Stop pussy footing around with bump stocks.
6758 2018-02-21 00:39:52 Let’s start somewhere simple. Ban bump stocks and anything else that makes a gun shoot faster than what a person could do with a trigger pull. There is no need for magazines that hold over 10 rounds. Reinstate the mental health restrictions trump got rid of.
6759 2018-02-21 00:39:50 Of course not...My point is, congress will offer watered down expansions of background checks as “THE” solution. When in actuality it would amount to a bandaid on a gushing wound.We need a ban on AR-15’s & similar weapons, bump stocks & also curb the ability to buy unlimited Ammo
6760 2018-02-21 00:39:49 Bump stocks are junk.  I wouldn't own one.   Good move throwing a bone to the leftist morons.
6761 2018-02-21 00:39:49 Just a question... weren't bump stocks made to assist the disabled?  I'm truly asking as I have this but can't find any firm information
6762 2018-02-21 00:39:42 @realDonaldTrump is now going to ban bump stocks.. I’ve tried to stay supportive but this is the last straw so to speak. Good luck in 2020 you’re going to need it
6763 2018-02-21 00:39:36 @realDonaldTrump 
Bump stocks allow semi-automatic assault weapons to mimic fully automatic assault weapons. They do not turn semi-automatic weapons in to "machine guns". you're using words to dodge and confuse. stop it.
6764 2018-02-21 00:39:32 Trump directs Justice Dept. to craft ban on 'bump stocks' as shooting response takes shape
6765 2018-02-21 00:39:25 #AlexJonesShowFirst he came for bump stocks, then your AR-15...

#TrumpIsComingForYourGuns
6766 2018-02-21 00:39:23 Trump banned bump stocks lol
6767 2018-02-21 00:39:22 Order on bump stocks a knee jerk reaction you are being used @realDonaldTrump
6768 2018-02-21 00:39:17 Dem Rep. Tim Ryan from Ohio is making a fool of himself on Cris Matthews Hardball over AR15 ban. Dems failng to demand outright ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity mags, all killing machines, are betraying their constituents and will pay the price.
6769 2018-02-21 00:39:17 Legislation would get it done faster than an executive order. Where is your proposed law, congressman?

Bump stocks weren't used in FL shooting.

This is a weak way to do nothing. It's hollow words. #WeCallBS
#ny19
6770 2018-02-21 00:39:16 The NRA will turn bump  stocks into their so called for leaf.

They care more about arms profits than country.
6771 2018-02-21 00:39:10 I'm guessing the NRA will gladly trade this for the additional "ammo" it will give them for their Niemöller scare-ads.  "First they came for our bump stocks..."  And, I'm sure the GOA will paste them for it.
6772 2018-02-21 00:39:09 Not going to happen. The platform is too popular and to make a sweeping ban of them would only cause further issues for law abiding citizens that would be a political nightmare. He's only doing the bump stocks to shut people up.
6773 2018-02-21 00:39:03 You leave this matter up to congress. They are the ones who right the laws. BTW - Bump Stocks are technically not illegal and therefore the AG would do a thing about it. ;)

This is only 1 of 2 decisions Trump has made I don't like. I'm still happy.
6774 2018-02-21 00:38:59 1) "Bump stocks" not =  full auto
2) A-R-15 with "bump stock" is not a machine gun.
3) A-R w bump stock is wildly inaccurate
4) can achieve same results w a shoelace wrapped around trigger+tied to belt loop
5)allows BATFEIEIO to ban any gun parts they choose
6775 2018-02-21 00:38:55 @RealAlexJones First he came for bump stocks, then your AR-15...

#TrumpIsComingForYourGuns
6776 2018-02-21 00:38:53 Bump stocks should be illegal.  Agree it is an attempt at a workaround to bypass the law.  Pretty crap product anyway.
6777 2018-02-21 00:38:51 Bump stocks is nowhere near enough and not a satisfactory response to the Parkland shooting. #AssaultWeaponsBan
6778 2018-02-21 00:38:21 Ima listen to this as soon as Beethoven's 9th wraps up. How 'bout that Trump though? RIP Bump-Stocks.
6779 2018-02-21 00:38:19 Bump stocks are bad but not the real issue. Congress must return the ban assault weaponry, repeal the law sheltering manufacturers and sellers. Make gun insurance mandatory.
6780 2018-02-21 00:38:18 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. President, banning bump stocks and what have you is exactly the WRONG thing to do! Your be playing straight into the hands of the Left, because IT NEVER ENDS! Today, bump stocks. Tomorrow, standard capacity magazines. AR-15'Ss next week!
6781 2018-02-21 00:38:16 Step in the right direction but bump stocks don’t kill.
6782 2018-02-21 00:38:08 Trump thinking about banning bump stocks is all political,!since a bump stock wasn’t even used in the massacre; let it pass, he’s showing he’s willing to negotiate but the Democrats will keep adding onto the bill like they did last time and sink it, just like they always do.
6783 2018-02-21 00:38:08 A start, but the right thing to do is to direct congress to address bump stocks and assault guns!
6784 2018-02-21 00:38:05 "But what about Obama?" says the guy, inaccurately blaming Obama.

Way to also mention MS13, props for that.

Bump stocks aren't actual firearms, so the ATF ruled they didn't have the authority to regulate them in 2010. They were approved in 2003, Obama didn't blame Bush for it.
6785 2018-02-21 00:37:59 @realDonaldTrump Why are you directing the DOJ to ban bump stocks?  Stabbing gun owners in the back after they supported you is poor form. Stop please.
6786 2018-02-21 00:37:55 I see all these kids out here saying they're not going to vote for Trump anymore because of bump stocks infringing on their second amendment hate to tell him bump stops are an accessory they are not firearms has nothing to do with the Second Amendment
6787 2018-02-21 00:37:51 $ifxy please don't post crap stocks with $ifxy tag and $andi tag..
6788 2018-02-21 00:37:44 Trump just lost a vote . But at this rate there will be no next time. I'll say it real sloooow......people kill...people... not bump stocks. such a sell out.. #Trumpdone.
6789 2018-02-21 00:37:42 Banning bump stocks is a strawman's way of dealing with a major issue. Rearranging crappy patio furniture. This does start the process but a lot more has to be done.
6790 2018-02-21 00:37:39 @RepTimRyan Just say it. BAN AR-15 and Bump stocks. Get some guts and DO it!!! You are bumbling to avoid making a stand on Hardball.
6791 2018-02-21 00:37:23 I believe this gesture to ban bump stocks, while good, falls under #6
6792 2018-02-21 00:37:19 Trump just said bump stocks turn semi-auto rifles into “machine guns”.  Are his shit eating fans going to fill their diapers over that misuse of language?
6793 2018-02-21 00:37:15 Wait, Timmeh. "Did you take an AR-15 duck hunting with your kid or not? If not, don't mention duck hunting when discussing bump stocks. You get that, right(?)"... #hardball
6794 2018-02-21 00:37:00 He will distract us with bump stocks and quietly deregulate suppressors later.
6795 2018-02-21 00:36:56 no, an ar-15 is an ar-15.  the bump stocks make them into "fully automatic".
6796 2018-02-21 00:36:56 Thanks for pressing him on bump stocks in your interview, Piers! Much appreciated
6797 2018-02-21 00:36:55 You sure are a funny guy! If Trump was defending bump stocks, you would probably lose your mind. Or......are you defending bump stocks?
6798 2018-02-21 00:36:55 @realDonaldTrump Dont let the gun control freaks cause a knee jerk reaction to infringe on our gun rights.  37000 people are killed each year with cars and we dont ban them.  10k with guns.  Dont ban bump stocks, but its ok for tougher background checks.  BANS WONT HELP!
6799 2018-02-21 00:36:54 That would make gun stocks a VERY bad investment.
6800 2018-02-21 00:36:32 would you say you bumped up your stock of bump stocks?
6801 2018-02-21 00:36:32 Shhhh! If he figures out there's more to stocks than their price, he might tell his audience.
6802 2018-02-21 00:36:20 It's the bare minimum to ask for a ban on bump stocks after Las Vegas. Fact that assault weapons are permitted at all is insane.  #BradyBill
6803 2018-02-21 00:36:20 Uh oh Trump getting bump stocks outta here
6804 2018-02-21 00:36:18 It’s the assault rifles, @realDonaldTrump - not the bump stocks. You’re a couple mass shootings behind the curb dipstick. What in the hell have you been doing? Golfing?
6805 2018-02-21 00:36:15 @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews  Trump's push for the removal of bump stocks is a strong position!  Great idea by Trump!
6806 2018-02-21 00:36:10 Time has passed since the Las Vegas shooting and now Trump had decided to act on bump stocks. This is just a sugar coating in the hope it will silence people. So when the next massacre happens is he going to ban schools?! #KillerTrump #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
6807 2018-02-21 00:36:08 Aaaaaaaand Dump signs memo banning bump stocks. Y’cool?
6808 2018-02-21 00:36:05 There’s a book called “lifecycle investing” I think that talks about this a bit. I’d love to be able to be in stocks at 150% for example in my Roth based on age and future expected deposits. Today it requires me managing buying 2 year leaps and such. Lots of effort.
6809 2018-02-21 00:36:02 Here's the issue of the moment! Trump Takes Step to Ban 'Bump Stocks' - Wall Street Journal
6810 2018-02-21 00:35:40 Stocked up on bump stocks today for the coming black market. Gonna make a bundle!
6811 2018-02-21 00:35:30 Bump stocks were only used once? ASSAULT RIFLES EVERY TIME!
6812 2018-02-21 00:35:28 sorry AZ, i won’t be visiting a state that supports “bump stocks” !  i’ll vacation elsewhere   #BanAR15 too
6813 2018-02-21 00:35:23 You're absolutely right, outlawign bump stocks falls very far short of what's needed. #NeverAgain
6814 2018-02-21 00:35:19 @realdonaldtrump President Trump already said he would support legislation HOURS ago during The Medal Of  Valor Ceremony that bans your Bump Stocks, which you would not know if you stepped on one.Experts said after the horrible Las Vegas shooting a belt will make a bump stock
6815 2018-02-21 00:35:14 Ask him who APPROVED BUMP STOCKS, Obama 2010.
6816 2018-02-21 00:35:13 I noticed when he wrote this he blamed Obama again for the bump stocks popularity. What a toad
6817 2018-02-21 00:35:10 @realDonaldTrump Dear Sir, I hope u will consider adding a buy back program for gun stocks. To get them off our streets. I think u are the only one who can help save our children from those who try to kill them. You are great 
6818 2018-02-21 00:35:07 that's a lie. Obama respects the US constitution. Obama had no constitutional grounds to declare bump stocks illegal. That's Congress' job.
6819 2018-02-21 00:35:07 Wow Meathead... that’s some really deep sleuthing you did there.  Question: why doesn’t tRUmp do (or even say) anything about it? Could Benedict Donald be a double-traitor perhaps? Better go hide your bump stocks, boi.  
  
#TrumpColluded
6820 2018-02-21 00:35:06 “bump stocks” sound like something your rich friend’s dad went to prison for.
6821 2018-02-21 00:34:54 I’m an NRA life member and do not think that bump stocks should be legal or at least have the same approval process as fully automatics, which is VERY stringent!
6822 2018-02-21 00:34:53 So stupid that Trump now says to ban bump stocks. Bro you should've done that back in October. It was an easy "just do." How about you do that AND address the rest of our gun problem.
6823 2018-02-21 00:34:45 I can’t believe conservatives are saying “it’s just bump stocks..” blah blah! I don’t care if it’s the Color of the weapon or holster. No touch 
6824 2018-02-21 00:34:39 One of the first things that needs to happen is to allow the CDC to once again monitor and analyse gun statistics for our country. We also need to ensure uniform reporting country wide. A ban on assault weapons and mods like bump stocks. We then need uniform...
6825 2018-02-21 00:34:23 They owed us the banning of bump stocks after the LAST 50 ppl were massacred. What are they going to do for #Parkland ?
6826 2018-02-21 00:34:22 so trump , you are not protecting the 2nd amendment .. bump stocks dont turn a rifle into machine guns.. wow  the rhino in chief . i think most has reservations about you and you are making it true
6827 2018-02-21 00:34:18 Broadly speaking I support the 2nd amendment and I'm open to hearing arguments of why America needs bump stocks, but as of now I just don't see one.
6828 2018-02-21 00:34:10 Worrisome that he's using the #Parkland shooting to take action on bump stocks, which we were demanding 5 months ago after #LasVegas. This seems like a cookie to make us go away.
6829 2018-02-21 00:34:09 Banning Bump stocks should be legal. We can’t own machine guns so this shouldn’t be an issue
6830 2018-02-21 00:33:34 Many conservatives are freaking out because President Trump directed the DOJ to ban bump stocks.

But I have no problem with this.

If machine guns are illegal, why the hell would a modification that makes a semi-automatic shoot like an automatic be legal?
6831 2018-02-21 00:33:28 Dems should have joined President Trump in outlawing bump stocks,the device used by Vegas shooter. 
The manufacturer must be Democrat.
6832 2018-02-21 00:33:26 While I doubt anyone is more pro #2A than I am, bump stocks probably should be banned.  Worthless for any hunting, accuracy or self defense.  LV is lucky the shooter didn't convert his weapons to select fire or moreover to 3 shot burst kits or many more would have perished. #NRA
6833 2018-02-21 00:33:20 First he came for bump stocks, then your AR-15...

#TrumpIsComingForYourGuns
6834 2018-02-21 00:33:20 Giving up bump stocks is an easy sacrificial lamb for the death lobby. Bump Stocks aren’t manufactured by gun makers whose interests the NRA represents.
6835 2018-02-21 00:33:18 I agree with @realDonaldTrump on banning bump stocks.  It’s a small step in the right direction, but any positive movement is a good start.
6836 2018-02-21 00:33:05 That's insane. The whole point in things like bump stocks (in my opinion) is to even the odds between the citizen and a government armed with fully automatic weapons. The point in the Second Amendment is to keep us free.
6837 2018-02-21 00:33:05 Exactly all he did was to instruct the DOJ to suggest possible regs on bump stocks , to waste a couple of wks/mths until the media focuses on the next shiny object,  making it look like he is doing something while he does nothing again, he is playing the American people
6838 2018-02-21 00:33:04 Bump stocks are not firearms. They are firearm accessories The ATF has no power to regulate them. This NRA talking point has no merit.
6839 2018-02-21 00:33:03 Doesn't the NRA already support the ban of bump stocks? Don't quote me on that I could have heard incorrectly.
6840 2018-02-21 00:32:58 I’m not right about much, so don’t put much “stock” in my opinion on bump stocks. #I’mNoComedian #ItsSadIEvenMadeThatPun
6841 2018-02-21 00:32:58 The sb in the WH only decided to ban bump stocks to make himself look good.  Where was he months ago? What a pig! How coincidental that he did it today
6842 2018-02-21 00:32:57 @realDonaldTrump is only proposing ban on bum stocks because the NRA said they would be willing to go along with that ban! 
They probably don't make them so they don't care, no sales lost for them!!!!!

#NeverAgain

#TheResistance
6843 2018-02-21 00:32:56 You've never listened to the other side, you just clutch your guns and act like there's no possible route for changing this country's sad reputation for mass killings.
It's garbage to want stringent background checks? Removing ARs? Banning bump stocks? Reasonable controls?
6844 2018-02-21 00:32:54 This isn’t a piece of legislation though, he just sent a memo to the DOJ asking them to say whether or not bump stocks comply with the law. Don’t believe the fucking media.
6845 2018-02-21 00:32:51 It is already a bait and switch. This should have been done in response to Las Vegas, where bump stocks were actually used. To do this in response to Florida is really an indicator of just what a bait and switch it is.
6846 2018-02-21 00:32:43 Mark Levin commented on Trump signing into law that no accessories could be sold that turns a regular rifle into rapid fire gun.(bump stocks,etc)suggested the age to join the military should be 21. He said he found it interesting that conservatives today jump to progressive ideas
6847 2018-02-21 00:32:30 LMFAO
6848 2018-02-21 00:32:25 I sold $Riot too early!! GRRR, Working on my full time i couldnt see the whole chart the way i wanted... Short @ 12.16 and Bought back @ 11.12. I so wanted to hold this over night but you cant really thrust these stocks and now is at 10.65.... Good Trade either way...
6849 2018-02-21 00:32:25 Not over bump stocks
6850 2018-02-21 00:32:24 Do your research Joe. @SenFeinstein says administration can’t ban bump stocks using regulators or executive order. Only way to ban them is for congress to pass a law. That will never happen.
6851 2018-02-21 00:32:22 Don't find any solace in the fact that Trump is banning bump stocks. This isn't Trump going against his base or the NRA; it's something even the NRA has said needs to be done. I won't be impressed until Trump does something the NRA paid him $30m not to do.
6852 2018-02-21 00:32:20 I've been hunting and shooting for almost fifty years. I don't mind a ban on bump stocks at all. But note to Libs when the sh*t hits the fan you'll be running to the nearest NRA member for protection.
6853 2018-02-21 00:32:17 Thank you President Trump for possibly fixing what Eric Holder did. I saw the letter authorizing bump stocks signed by him at a shooting range in San Diego when he was all powerful.
6854 2018-02-21 00:32:12 Why stop with bump stocks? Ban all weapons. Ban anything that can be used to assault.
6855 2018-02-21 00:32:06 Ok so I should not infer that trump was in a hurry to ban Muslims but wants to slow walk bans on the bump stocks? That was what it looked like to me but fed rules vs laws vs exec orders are not clear to me.
6856 2018-02-21 00:32:04 “Personal finance” should be a required class in HS for all four years like math/science/history. With different areas of study... paying for college, retirement, stocks/bonds, mortgages, how interest rates work, etc.
6857 2018-02-21 00:32:00 @realDonaldTrump sounded like a kidnap victim being forced to make a video when he about banning bump stocks #Hardball
6858 2018-02-21 00:32:00 @jimsciutto mass has already banned bump stocks
6859 2018-02-21 00:31:57 Bump stocks has nothing to do with  with violence with guns #dumbpresident

6861 2018-02-21 00:31:54 Bump stocks are not the problem, a part of it but not the problem.
6862 2018-02-21 00:31:47 I don’t oppose sensible reforms. No Bump stocks, Improved Background checks, Very strong penalty’s for gun crimes.
6863 2018-02-21 00:31:41 But let’s ban bump stocks.  Or said differently, let’s crack open the door so the gun grabbers can kick it in
6864 2018-02-21 00:31:31 @realDonaldTrump Was shocked you caved to hysteria and banned bump stocks, which do not create "machine gun" action, contrary to hype. You promised to defend 2A, but you just broke your oath to us and nation.
6865 2018-02-21 00:31:29 Bump stocks.?? No one gives a flying fuck about bump stocks... @realDonaldTrump #youarethebiggestloser
6866 2018-02-21 00:31:18 I suspect collusion between Trump and the NRA regarding bump stocks.
6867 2018-02-21 00:31:11 Missing 2 days of golf get Trump to direct lil Jeffy Sessions to ban bump stocks.
6868 2018-02-21 00:31:06 Bump stocks. Good! Now stop sitting on those Russian sanctions, Traitor-in-Chief.
6869 2018-02-21 00:30:59 Get "assault" style weapons under same regs as full-auto. More do-able than ban. Legislation necessary for bump stocks; current law NG
6870 2018-02-21 00:30:46 get it straight.. trump did NOT 'ban bump stocks'.. he signed a memo to Justice Dept to PROPOSE regulations relating to them.. it's to keep 'us' quiet.. he is lying AGAIN & media falling for it. @ABC, @CBS @NBC @CNN @MSNBC
6871 2018-02-21 00:30:35 Very small, considering it would still be legal to buy the weapon that was used in the recent mass shooting. Stopping bump stocks sales but not large capacity rifles is a small step.
6872 2018-02-21 00:30:28 Limit clip/magazine size
All firearms are sold and transferred with a local LEO witness 
All guns are registered 
Bump Stocks are banned
Domestic abusers MUST relinquish all firearms for a period of time
Single-shot rifles only are allowed (for hunting and sport shooting)
6873 2018-02-21 00:30:27 Banning bump stocks is not the answer
6874 2018-02-21 00:30:08 What legislation do you propose? Ban bump stocks is fine by me. Banning “assault weapons” is bs. 3/4 of firearms in circulation are semi auto and not ar15 so why single them out?
6875 2018-02-21 00:29:59 That could be, though I’d bet money something comes out of this. It’s actually a golden ticket. He could get our dream issues passed if he plays it right. And the bump stocks is the perfect issue to give a concession on, just like DACA
6876 2018-02-21 00:29:58 While I know from research that bump stocks make a shooter less accurate and a trained shooter can shoot just as fast with much more accuracy w/o one, this will not help shootings... a lack of common sense, core values, child discipline, and GOD, in today’s society is the problem
6877 2018-02-21 00:29:55 Ban the assault weapons, then you can have all the gun stocks you want.
6878 2018-02-21 00:29:53 @realDonaldTrump  Sir, I just saw the headline that says u are banning bump stocks. You are the best. U took action when no one else had the guts to. Thank you. 
6879 2018-02-21 00:29:50 Who believes gun control nuts would be satisfied if bump stocks or the AR-15 were banned? These crazies would only be satisfied with the wholesale confiscation of ALL our weapons! Give an inch, they'll take a mile - at gunpoint I'm sure.
6880 2018-02-21 00:29:49 Real Common sense gun control include NOT only universal background checks but
A Mandated 48 hour waiting period to purchase
And MOST Importantly: Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
6881 2018-02-21 00:29:44 I think bump stocks are the argument against "criminals will just get illegal guns". If that were true, a hacky workaround wouldn't be necessary. They'd just buy the fully automatic weapons a bump stock approximates.
6882 2018-02-21 00:29:25 Agree.  No prob canning bump stocks.  Real issue is mental health and other background and safety checks not complete. Then utter fail at the FBI
6883 2018-02-21 00:29:24 Since Oct. 31, 2017, department store stocks have surged 43% (Sears doesn’t count, no longer a retailer) $JCP $M $KSS
6884 2018-02-21 00:29:16 @PressSec Next X Press ask Guns,Bump Stocks&Automatics:Please Ask WHERE THEY'VE BEEN DECADES NOT INQUIRING SAME IN CHICAGO? I know what it's like to look out Home Window seeing Hispanic Gangs Firing To See Which to Rule GRADE SCHOOL THAT YR! 1 Sawed Off Shotgun & 1 SemiAutomatic!
6885 2018-02-21 00:29:10 Bump stocks aren't weapons. They are not firearms. They are an accessory and a pretty useless one at that.
6886 2018-02-21 00:29:03 @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @dbongino @SebGorka @foxandfriends   Bump stocks were legalized by Obama HE did nothing to stop it
6887 2018-02-21 00:28:59 I heard Trade Zero has more short inventory for stocks. It that your broker?
6888 2018-02-21 00:28:41 I personally don't listen to the lies others will wanna dig up on you, however, I did hear you wanna ban bump stocks??? Is this true, and if it is you have some explaining to do. We The People didn't hire and vote you in to help shred OUR Constitutional Rights!!!!!
6889 2018-02-21 00:28:35 So happy Trump is pushing to ban bump stocks! 
6890 2018-02-21 00:28:32 Bump stocks legislation is just smokescreen legislation.
6891 2018-02-21 00:28:30 This is political Jiu-Jitsu and it's working Thomas. Bump stocks are a loser policy wise, it's time to cut them loose
6892 2018-02-21 00:28:27 @realDonaldTrump , ban AR-15's and I swear I'll never insist on banning AR-15 bump stocks ever again. Deal?
6893 2018-02-21 00:28:27 Just saw on news he ordered AG to ban bump stocks that Obama made legal. More needs to happen re Mental Health, school security FBI and LE follow up etc. Our binary society needs to change.
6894 2018-02-21 00:28:22 Same thing Gov Cuomo did in NY he banned bayonet lugs, pistol grips, collapsible stocks and muzzle breaks. Literally did nothing to address the issue but he acts like he did. They r so dumb. Manufacturers have already circumvented his dumb law.
6895 2018-02-21 00:28:21 Thank you Mr. President in banning bump stocks now let's move onto Assult Weapons and stringent background checks
6896 2018-02-21 00:28:19 Very disappointed with @POTUS ‘s uninformed, anti-freedom decision to ask that bump stocks be banned today. 
Restricting and taking away the (relatively few) freedoms we still have is never the right answer, from any President or party. Let Dems be the totalitarians... 
Sad 
6897 2018-02-21 00:28:11 DT is full of shit w/ another distractor for idiot MSM. Bump stocks should be banned tho have shown up once. DT could've encouraged FL Legs to at least 'discuss' ban on assault weapons...write another EO - not 'back' this other ban. Remember DT encouraging supporters to 2A HRC?
6898 2018-02-21 00:28:09 You do realize that when you ridicule Trump for taking 4 months to ban bump stocks you are blaming Obama for taking 8 years to do nothing.
6899 2018-02-21 00:28:06 Bump Stocks were illegal during the Obama Administration Stonewall Jackson. It is the Republicans that made the Bump Stocks Legal.
6900 2018-02-21 00:28:06 Let's Outlaw bump stocks to make people thing that's what was used in Las Vegas when actually it was a fully automatic weapon at least the 7.62.
6901 2018-02-21 00:28:01 What! Is @realDonaldTrump doing dem bidding? Bump stocks are NOT required to do bump fire. And there are any numbers of videos on YouTube demoing it. You need nothing more than a nail driven in the side of a window opening.  Its ONLY going to affect law-abiding citizens. #tcot
6902 2018-02-21 00:27:54 On general, yes. This is a foothold for more. 

But if you're going to compromise on #2A , this is pretty safe. Many responsible gun owners won't defend the merits of bump stocks.
6903 2018-02-21 00:27:51 @CNN already trying to find ways to criticize him for asking for a ban on bump stocks. They dont want him to do anything to msm and libs can continue to say he's the problem.
6904 2018-02-21 00:27:34 Should be noted that the NRA issued a statement after Parkland, Fla shooting that regulation of bump stocks is probably a good idea. It's called cover.
6905 2018-02-21 00:27:33 Bump stocks exist already because they DO NOT fit the definition of a machine gun per the NFA.  THAT's why the ATF OKed them in the first place. 

If I can recreate a bump stock effect by using a shoe string or my belt loop, it's patently obvious the gun is not altered.
6906 2018-02-21 00:27:32 It’s a token gesture and too little too late. The NRA could care less about bump stocks as long as people can still buy unlimited assault weapons.
6907 2018-02-21 00:27:31 Ban bump stocks? I’m more of a “shall not be infringed” type of guy
6908 2018-02-21 00:27:28 I might be wrong and correct me if I am but I thought bump stocks could be made. If correct a ban would not help.
The Las Vegas shooter modified his weapons. Can't stop that.
6909 2018-02-21 00:27:10 President Trump wants to ban bump stocks who cares about bump stocks less than the AR-15 all together people are already challenging they won't give up their car so it's time for the government to make a law Banning the gun in the US. Let's protect our people
6910 2018-02-21 00:27:03 is eurooilstock data proprietary? there shouldn't be a % sign on the change of the stocks.
6911 2018-02-21 00:26:38 Disappointed to hear a minority crying about Trumps proposal to outlaw bump stocks, I don't think it moves homicide numbers much but it's a nobrainer to get done
6912 2018-02-21 00:26:35 President Trump directs Attorney General Sessions and Justice Dept to propose regulations to ban 'bump stocks,' which makes it easier to fire rounds more quickly. #guns
6913 2018-02-21 00:26:35 It is about time that the Bump Stocks are going to actually get banned. We need permanent Legislation to do this first and make sure that they are permanently banned.
6914 2018-02-21 00:26:23 NRA in Oct. said bump stocks should require additional regulations.
6915 2018-02-21 00:26:14 You got stocks, bonds, commodities and then they all break down to sub divisions. What’s going to make money doe. The research 
6916 2018-02-21 00:26:07 Really?  DJT supports banning Bump Stocks??  Then why the hell didn't do something about after the Las Vegas Massacre in October?   Talk is cheap.
6917 2018-02-21 00:26:05 Bump stocks are 1 pull, 1 bullet. They don't convert the rifle to full-auto. ATF, under law, had little choice in the ruling. Sad but true
6918 2018-02-21 00:25:57 So don't ban bump stocks? Alrighty. Guess you want more dead kids.
6919 2018-02-21 00:25:49 @POTUS is not the 1st to addr banning bump stocks, but he will take all the credit for the ban. Wasn't it @SpeakerRyan in Oct, that REFUSED to allow a debate on the banning of bump stocks after the LV massacre? The ban is a start, but it would not have stopped 17 kids from dying.
6920 2018-02-21 00:25:44 Bump stocks are dog and pony show..have to aim much higher
6921 2018-02-21 00:25:35 Pruitt’s security detail cost $832,735.40 in salary & travel expenses for his first quarter at the agency, according to E&E News obtained records last year under the Freedom of Information Act. #Traitor @realDonaldTrump only says bump stocks & its good news but its congress' job.
6922 2018-02-21 00:25:30 Of course not, it's not about the issue at hand, it won't ever be enough and they will never like President Trump.  It's about getting guns out of the hands of "everyone" and it's about continuous hate of POTUS.  Those two narratives of the left cannot be fixed by bump stocks.
6923 2018-02-21 00:25:29 Are you saying the source of funds use to buy bitcoin are from credit the way stocks are bought on margin? or homes from mortgages?
6924 2018-02-21 00:25:21 Please explain WHY it is necessary for ordinary ppl to own semi auto weapons or devices like bump stocks.....WHY ?
6925 2018-02-21 00:25:05 A memo to propose a study to determine if we should ban bump stocks is not the same in banning bump stocks, and why not just ban the damn rifles all together??
6926 2018-02-21 00:25:04 Who gives a fuck if they ban bump stocks they aren’t accurate for anything anyways
6927 2018-02-21 00:24:42 Keep it going! Bump stocks area a token concession. A start, but not nearly enough to stop the mass killings of our citizens, by our citizens - and  the  senseless slaughter of  our school children.
6928 2018-02-21 00:24:40 If it took this long and something this tragic to finally provoke action on bump stocks, I have no hope for what it takes to finally ban assault rifles.
6929 2018-02-21 00:24:37 Semicap equipment guys will have to be shorted down after first momo break; stocks will be down by half before any signs on the BS.
6930 2018-02-21 00:24:37 I understand the concern over bump-stocks, however people need to understand that the same effect can be achieved with a belt-loop on your pants, or a rubber band, or several other methods.  Personally I feel there is a mental health crisis in this country.
6931 2018-02-21 00:24:27 President trump making bump stocks illegal,Personally I don’t mind. You can still shoot a gun without one. What do you guys think???
6932 2018-02-21 00:24:20 Maybe you missed my point (unsurprising)...bump stocks SHOULD be banned. But they've been used in ONE (albeit the deadliest one in American history) mass shooting. So they are NOT the root cause. 

I've been shouting for an assault weapon ban for YEARS you moron. Crawl b4 u walk
6933 2018-02-21 00:23:55 Keep the guns, impose tighter regulations to buy them, simple . Ban bump stocks, simple
6934 2018-02-21 00:23:51 True, back then it wasn’t the priority it is now. This fall we may see elections lost because the candidate takes money from the NRA. Trump even agreed to look at bump stocks. Times have changed.
6935 2018-02-21 00:23:41 agree 100%. you can't give them an inch. it's not like libs will stop bitching if he bans bump stocks, they'll just become emboldened and push for more.
6936 2018-02-21 00:23:30 Obama sucked.!  He supported bump stocks!!  Why is this so hard to understand for the @DNC ???  Trump can only do so much in our system and is banning them.
6937 2018-02-21 00:23:29 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We can’t ignore crazy people killing innocent by Banning guns rifles bump stocks etc. Guns don’t kill. Let’s find those who shouldn’t have rights to a gun / rifles and block them.
6938 2018-02-21 00:23:23 True, I should just have left it at ‘killing’, rather than ‘killing people’. Are semi-automatic weapons converted with bump stocks used much in hunting? As a responsible gun owner, what would you want to know about someone before putting a gun in their hands?
6939 2018-02-21 00:23:20 Trump ban bump stocks. Listen to  Isaac Green of Anti School. Ghttps://youtu.be/ULPUr8fv4A
6940 2018-02-21 00:23:14 Obama legalized bump stocks! Now we're taking a step backwards?! Giving the EVIL Dems 1/2 inch is like giving them 1,000 miles! This will be an irreversible mistake! And the mental health checks is a slippery slope. We have the majority and are losing it!
6941 2018-02-21 00:23:12 Honestly he just made the demand for bump stocks that much higher.
6942 2018-02-21 00:23:08 He already knows that he can use it to try and further they dismantling of our system. I can hear SS now "Look Trump tried to ban bump stocks and congress would not let him."
6943 2018-02-21 00:23:07 Trump's call for a ban on bump stocks does little to fix the major problem of out of control guns. He will have to do something for real, like digital data base of those unfit to own guns. Stop conceal carry nation wide until issue is solved.
6944 2018-02-21 00:23:04 Bets on the NRA favoring a new AWB? They already gave the okay to ban bump stocks!!!!
6945 2018-02-21 00:22:56 So you all disagree with Trump on bump stocks then yeah
6946 2018-02-21 00:22:51 Go back and dig up Eric Holder’s comments where he basically admits that he needed to help create discord to facilitate gun control. My opinion is that is why you have fast & furious, plus Obama Admin doing nothing about bump stocks.
6947 2018-02-21 00:22:45 What do bump stocks do?
6948 2018-02-21 00:22:39 Apparently Trump just signed a memorandum to make bump stocks illegal, so I guess Slide Fire Solutions need to liquidate before that happens.
6949 2018-02-21 00:22:30 Also banning bump stocks is the only compromise that NRA agreed for.
6950 2018-02-21 00:22:29 @businessinsider Check Diane Feinstein tweet. This memo means nothing. They need new legislation and this is just bump stocks.What about background checks, assault rifles, AR15s?
6951 2018-02-21 00:22:22 @johnrobertsFox by the president listening to other peoples ideas your logic is that means he has no ideas himself? And banning bump stocks is the key to stopping mass shootings... Are you that freaking dumb?!?!?! Get rid of this guy @FoxNews and put in Kevin all the time!!!
6952 2018-02-21 00:22:20 I agree that shouldn't make that big a deal out of this since Obama admin are the ones actually legalized bump stocks. But all the disinformation  is so frustrating.. Seen so much ignorance out of the Senator lately, just had to vent.
6953 2018-02-21 00:22:11 Glad to see President @realDonaldTrump moving forward with the banning of bump stocks and removing that loophole from the Federal Assault Weapon Ban.
6954 2018-02-21 00:22:00 Yes, they supported banning bump stocks. Have not seen that they support stronger background checks, renewing gun licenses (as we do for driving), limiting assault rifles to those with special training, etc. They also promote the "good guy with a gun"nonsense.
6955 2018-02-21 00:21:47 Military style guns need to be banned, the bump stocks and background checks are a start but not enough.
6956 2018-02-21 00:21:46 crypto as a whole reminds of the early internet stocks.....what people are saying about bitcoin they said about #amazon
6957 2018-02-21 00:21:36 They caved on bump stocks too!
6958 2018-02-21 00:21:35 @chadbensonshow I’m an NRA member, and I have no problem banning bump stocks. 

If full auto is illegal, then why would we allow people to sell something that’s only purpose is to defeat the law.
6959 2018-02-21 00:21:31 If you have a weak hand, you still have to play it. That's what Trump is doing now. Who cares about bump stocks.
6960 2018-02-21 00:21:24 8 years and Obama administrations only accomplishment on gun control was to reinstate the use of bump stocks. So don’t go blaming Pres Trump
6961 2018-02-21 00:21:23 RT @markknoller: Leading the network evening newscasts: CBS/NBC: students mobilize in wake of school shooting episode; ABC: Trump acts to ban bump stocks and open to other actions.
6962 2018-02-21 00:21:19 Especially when Obama legalized Bump Stocks in the first place.
6963 2018-02-21 00:21:07 People are concerned about his looking into bump stocks, but he's talked about that before. And yes, that would be very stupid. He needs the 2A people
6964 2018-02-21 00:21:03 Trump is just saying he supports banning bump stocks, he knows Congress won't pass any legislation. His statement is cover so he can have something to talk about at town hall.
6965 2018-02-21 00:21:01 Turning a semi auto to a full auto should always be illegal. As a gun owner bump stocks skirts the law and is a liability to responsible gun owners.
6966 2018-02-21 00:21:01 .... before pushing legislation to speed the FDA approval process. This was just one example of his habit of buying healthcare-related stocks and then pushing for policies that would increase their worth
6967 2018-02-21 00:20:52 No he is not bump stocks should be banned Nrs has been advocating this he has done nothing that move to the left
6968 2018-02-21 00:20:44 I did note that they got that part wrong. But yes, there is a legitimate argument to be made about bump stocks.
6969 2018-02-21 00:20:41 So now we know you don't care for UK fish stocks at all. You presumably think it is racist to do so! Ha ha ha
6970 2018-02-21 00:20:21 I kind of think Trump is posturing when he says he wants to ban bump stocks because Congress has already voted down such a bill. Maybe the kids can shame Congress into reconsidering. I doubt it. They will have to turn 18 and vote them out of office. I hope so.
6971 2018-02-21 00:20:20 Not only do they refuse to pass legislation banning these rifles and bump stocks but now they are verbally attacking the CHILDREN who are victims of a horrific crime. 

I am so F’ing disgusted. As if these kids haven’t been through enough 
6972 2018-02-21 00:19:55 So he says he would ban assault weapons and bump stocks, and push for waiting periods to purchase certain firearms. Now I want to see him pressure Congress for these laws like he pushes for everything else he wants. I’ll believe he’s serious then, not before.
6973 2018-02-21 00:19:54 President Trump is working to ban bump stocks, a move supported by the NRA as well as Democrats. Yet this is another example of the double standard this President faces, as we all know he will not receive any praise or fair coverage on the issue.
6974 2018-02-21 00:19:54 How about never say that. Bump stocks are just an attachment and guess what he's only doing it to get some heat off the issue. You know he's watching Fox and probably can't understand all the coverage it's getting.
6975 2018-02-21 00:19:50 People kill people with or without bump stocks
6976 2018-02-21 00:19:46 @POTUS @RealDonad_Trump I don't see eye to eye with you. However, I commend you for proposing a ban on bump stocks.  #FloridaSchoolShooting
6977 2018-02-21 00:19:41 Trump can not take executive action against bump stocks and he knows it. Such a liar.
6978 2018-02-21 00:19:25 I know nuffink about Mongolia stocks so I'll have to take y'alls word on it all
6979 2018-02-21 00:19:13 They will likely regulate bump stocks like they do fully automatic, silencers, and sbr
6980 2018-02-21 00:19:02 lol all he did was open a door to bump stocks being banned sometime in the future. just a PR move to lower the pressure he’s getting in the wake of these shootings
6981 2018-02-21 00:18:46 Do you have sources? Both bump stocks and fully automatic machine guns were found in the hotel room, but I could not find any report on which were used and which weren't. It's all speculation until it's officially released, which I'm guessing will be never...
6982 2018-02-21 00:18:32 Went for bump stocks today.
6983 2018-02-21 00:18:30 1. Assault rifles do not exist 
&
2. Bump stocks do not make the weapon automatic
6984 2018-02-21 00:18:12 TRUMP BANS BUMP STOCKS !!!!!!!!#!########!!!!!######!!!!######
6985 2018-02-21 00:18:07 That would be bump stocks -- be specific.

No one gives a shit about them...they suck.
But, guess who gets the mileage from this one?
6986 2018-02-21 00:18:05 All massacres using Assault Riffles didnt use bump stocks, except Vegas . . . This solves nothing
And there are many ways to make your Assault Riffle fully automatic...very simple
6987 2018-02-21 00:17:51 Yes, it is a step forward, but bump stocks were not the issue in #Parkland. #NeverAgain students know that this "action" was merely a sop to Cerberus. There is much more work to do.
6988 2018-02-21 00:17:48 No I'm not My opinion My family has guns /gun safes to store them but we have no automatic weapons and don't need them We protect ours very well with out them! Just feel they have no relevant use 4 the average gun owner! My opinion doesn't mean POTUS a traitor banning bump stocks
6989 2018-02-21 00:17:46 This is so simple as to be stupid... mechanisms are not the issue, rate of fire is, bump stocks should NEVER have been legal in the first place.
6990 2018-02-21 00:17:39 @realDonaldTrump I got you and Melania's thank you card today. As soon as I can, I'm going to frame it. Your announcement on banning bump stocks is the right thing to do.
6991 2018-02-21 00:17:28 Yes AR15 and bump stocks should be not available to public for sale.
I don't think law on bump stocks has been changed in Las Vegas or Nevada yet, after Mirage tragedy.
6992 2018-02-21 00:17:25 Things harder to get than guns and their add-ons:

Driver's license
Photo I.D.
Replacement Social Security card
Replacement birth certificate
Maiden name back after divorce
Background check pass for a "reality" tv show
Friendly service at the bank.

Kill the NRA
Bump Stocks
6993 2018-02-21 00:17:19 Just heard that @realDonaldTrump  supports banning bump stocks. Is the world changing... For the better? #YouGoDonny #guncontrol
6994 2018-02-21 00:17:17 Bum stocks?!? I thought it was a ban on bumper crops to support agricultural commodity prices.
6995 2018-02-21 00:17:06 Washington – Trump Orders Regulations Drawn Up To Ban Bump Stocks
6996 2018-02-21 00:16:49 it's a giant scam. Just like the mom and dad investors in tech stocks. They turned out brilliantly as well.
6997 2018-02-21 00:16:38 Except that craven Republicans in Congress never took it up ..glad Trump finally took some action on bump stocks.
6998 2018-02-21 00:16:32 I'm kinda confused, but what would banning bump stocks do in your opinion because you can simply bump fire with a belt and a finger or heck even a stick can make a semiautomatic rifle or handgun bump fire.
6999 2018-02-21 00:16:30 ドリコム休まないw
7000 2018-02-21 00:16:28 Bump stocks.

Big frigging deal, @GOP 

Melt them all down and use it to build a political prison.


7001 2018-02-21 00:16:26 Focus on something that is within reason. I hear Trump is interested in banning bump stocks. Won't matter because if someone wanted one they could easily make one. 
Same with magazines if extended mags are ever banned. #3Dprinting #AR15
7002 2018-02-21 00:16:15 Hrrrrmmmm.... Did someone tell Trump he’s against Regulations? It’s ok guys! The environmental/workplace regulations he’s rolling back will help offset any people who aren’t killed by bump stocks. 
7003 2018-02-21 00:16:04 @realDonaldTrump Vegas shooting was Oct 1.   Why the delay and now all of a sudden you are making a move on bump stocks? A little too late. The kids are on fire. Bless this generation. Future voters.
7004 2018-02-21 00:15:59 @realDonaldTrump Mr. president, bump stocks DON'T turn ANY weapon into a fully automatic. Banning them does not do a thing other than meaning you have to pull the trigger really fast with your finger.
7005 2018-02-21 00:15:49 If I'm not mistaken, there is wide spread support for the banning of bump stocks (including the NRA).  Frankly, I'm surprised they weren't banned after Las Vegas.
7006 2018-02-21 00:15:48 Don’t let this be about bump stocks only. All military style weapons must also be banned
7007 2018-02-21 00:15:42 Your job requires instant communication with you superiors or clients that can’t be handled through a simple phone call? 

A bump stock does NOT make an AR full auto. I think bump stocks are junk gimmicks that are prone to cause jams.
7008 2018-02-21 00:15:40 #stocks To supplement SSecurity:a special retirement account permitting individuals to invest up to $40,000 a year until age 75 using any investment vehicle, free of federal taxes, and free of brokerage/management fees until funds are withdrawn.
7009 2018-02-21 00:15:38 BBC headline: Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks'
Translation: Ramp up production of bump stocks, guys. You're gonna sell a ton of them!
7010 2018-02-21 00:15:34 How long have you been predicting a market crash? Why do you think people should start fire-selling stocks? So they can enjoy 0% or negative real return on Treasuries and bonds? Do you think they'll forget suddenly that profitability of US companies is at an all time high?
7011 2018-02-21 00:15:31 Bump stocks reinstated during Obama’s Administration. So not only did Obama do 0 on gun control, he made it worse.
7012 2018-02-21 00:15:29 @POTUS 
Replying to my earlier message...Sorry.  You don't need to amend the Constitution to ban bump stocks.  I thought it was a gun grab for the AR-15.
7013 2018-02-21 00:15:29 Why don’t you report the news that @realDonaldTrump banned bump stocks today???  @POTUS can only do so much!  Congress makes laws in America (in case you didn’t know that). Obama supported bumb stocks!! Check that fact! Now what will u all say? Trump is trying 2 make a difference
7014 2018-02-21 00:15:27 Soooo, bump stocks are the BEST you can do? Don't get me wrong .@realDonaldTrump , that is certainly an improvement, but given that last time Congress was up in arms about banning bump stocks, this is clearly the LEAST you could do. And it won't fly. Step it up Republicans.
7015 2018-02-21 00:15:12 @tedlieu @krassenstein
@kylegriffin1 @funder @RepAdamSchiff @SethAbramson @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @TeaPainUSA  How many of the mass shootings have had AR-15 involved and mental illness? Making bump stocks illegal is common sense. But only one shooter used those
7016 2018-02-21 00:15:06 After the Vegas shooting,
it didn't occur to trump
to ban bump-stocks?
What changed?
Did he just wake up?
He is so pathetic.
7017 2018-02-21 00:15:02 I don’t think he deserves any thanks. The ban of bump stocks should have been done immediately after the Vegas massacre. We should also ban assault rifles they do the same thing as bump stock with rapid file. Back ground checks should have been done years ago.
7018 2018-02-21 00:14:56 Mitch Bitch McConnell the tortoise and Ryan the Giddy are the leaders in the Senate and House they can stop bump stocks and AR15's!Over 500 ppl were shot in Vegas in 13min and 7min in Florida shot over 30 ppl and they still refused to do anything except obfuscate with lots of BS?
7019 2018-02-21 00:14:52 I’ll assure you if I want a bump stock I’ll just make it all the way. Junior. Don’t chip away at Our #2ndAmendment Bump stocks are a joke. #GunGrabbers are using them to abolish The #2nd
7020 2018-02-21 00:14:41 The @NRA does support responsible gun laws and were among the first to call for legislation on bump stocks #FloridaSchoolShooting
7021 2018-02-21 00:14:40 to be fair in this case I think bump stocks are only legal because of a loophole in ATF execution of standing law. Close that loophole and bye bye
7022 2018-02-21 00:14:21 @realDonaldTrump 
Ban bump stocks, really? Because every massacre has used them.  You just infringed on half your supporters, thanks!
7023 2018-02-21 00:14:16 You just self described a group of people that will never even be exposed to bump stocks, which defeats your own argument that doing so will have “NO EFFECT”.  I literally made you make yourself look stupid, and you’re blathering on like a child with memes.  You lose.
7024 2018-02-21 00:14:11 Are bump stocks useless without automatic weapons?
7025 2018-02-21 00:14:10 Yes! Lead from Congress and don’t stop at bump stocks.
7026 2018-02-21 00:13:58 I agree with Trump to ban bump stocks and other gun modifiers. They are not needed to hunt  or target shoot.
7027 2018-02-21 00:13:58 "The legislation included raising the "firearm possession age from 18 to 21 and banning bump stocks." It failed, 36-71. No wonder it's called the Gunshine state".
7028 2018-02-21 00:13:46 @realDonaldTrump @NRA I support a ban on bump stocks and strengthening background checks but stay away from my AR15 and other semi-automatic firearms or lose my support. Period.
7029 2018-02-21 00:13:45 Even though I think bump stocks and similar are wastes of ammo and grossly inaccurate at best... this bs opens the door for regulation against any number of accessories that make our arms more efficient.  Optics, bipods, rests etc... stop this PC Bullshit @NRA
7030 2018-02-21 00:13:36 Thousands of students stage walkout protesting Trumps lack of gun control pathetically he announces a ban on bump stocks and sells it like its a new bill. Those were already banned people its an empty gesture
7031 2018-02-21 00:13:34 No banning bum stocks damnit
7032 2018-02-21 00:13:24 Restrict AR ammo to 1500 FPS and lethality is greatly reduced and bump stocks stop working. Owners can still enjoy range time. Restricting ammo is quick and easy.
7033 2018-02-21 00:13:07 You Promised to Uphold the Constitution and Protect our 2nd Amendment Rights. Not cave in
Starting with Banning Bump Stocks.
What's next? It's people fixing that needs attention. Law Enforcement.
Enforce Present Laws.
7034 2018-02-21 00:12:11 Though just saw @realDonaldTrump signed into law that makes bump stocks illegal. That's good news
7035 2018-02-21 00:12:05 Some already have bump stocks. I don't own any "high capacity" mags. 
All of mine are standard capacity.  
Mag limits are useless. Watch videos on how a mag can be changed in mere seconds. That doesn't really make a difference. 1@30 or 3@10. Two reloads @2sec/each = 4 sec's
7036 2018-02-21 00:12:00 #realDonaldTrump finally changing tune on weapons but only on bump stocks. Really just nod and wink PR move. Knows he needs #Republicans in Congress to make it happen. Can blame them if it doesn't. #CommanderInCheat #VoteThemOut
7037 2018-02-21 00:11:58 @realdonaldtrump So you “asked ur admin to review bump stocks on Oct. 1,” & it took almost 3 mos. for the DOJ to publish it & another 2 mos. (& another mass shooting) for u to send @AGJeffsessions a memo to actually do something about them???  Talk about #FakeNews!!! @PressSec
7038 2018-02-21 00:11:52 Trump moves to ban Bump Stocks
7039 2018-02-21 00:11:50 45 thinks bump stocks are a sex toy accessory
7040 2018-02-21 00:11:44 Piers you know nothing about guns and what is going on. Bump stocks prevented the Las Vegas shooter from hitting more targets you cannot aim with those things. What happens when they use a white van to mow down people you going to outlaw white vans.?
7041 2018-02-21 00:11:41 Only because the NRA doesn’t make a dime from bump stocks.  They told Trump to throw the gun control a bone.  NRA only interested in guns and ammo.
7042 2018-02-21 00:11:40 No! I feel your frustration though. Our President a craftsman,thank God,when it comes to dealing w/ these double dealin snakes,that are now the Democratic Party. Bumb stocks, who cares! Just a chip in the deal. Have faith. Don't you fall in bucket.
7043 2018-02-21 00:11:28 Since I've been on decapeptyl my stocks have done very well, thank you.
7044 2018-02-21 00:11:28 A perfect time to read a statement to the public because it  will make him seem a tad bit empathetic, do you really believe otherwise? Even the NRA agrees they don’t need bump stocks and no doubt encouraged him to read the statement at this time
7045 2018-02-21 00:11:16 Stocks plunged as W.R. Berkley Corporation unveiled a irascible plate today.
7046 2018-02-21 00:11:10 Where did you get that from exactly? Stop pulling words out of your ass. Banning bump stocks is a great START to gun control.
7047 2018-02-21 00:11:08 Banning bump stocks is probably a logical move. They are incredibly inaccurate so the shooter shoots indiscriminately by default.
7048 2018-02-21 00:11:04 Hey Mr. "Friend to the second amendment", how can you jump on the "let's demonize bump stocks" bandwagon? A bump stock's just a range toy, its not a weapon, bump firing can be done just as well with nothing but your hands, let is start with this and it'll never stop, guaranteed
7049 2018-02-21 00:11:04 See? Not that difficult to pinpoint bump stocks or other stocks with that function.
7050 2018-02-21 00:10:59 President Trump direct Justice Department to ban bump stocks the same ones that "bumped" off another one of America's sweathearts(sweethearts) and yet can Doan get a life and get it before it was taken by "bump" the friendly gay pregnancy cheer leader for all people and nobody is
7051 2018-02-21 00:10:49 Restrict the velocity of AR ammunition to 1500 FPS and lethality is greatly reduced and bump stocks stop working. Owners can still enjoy range time. A compromise.
7052 2018-02-21 00:10:39 Banning bump stocks which turn rifles literally into machine guns is the least to be done. Crap, even the NRA agreed to this one, something like 6 major shootings ago.  We need an assault rifle ban period.
7053 2018-02-21 00:10:36 Certain TV personalities in DC think they're gonna thread this issue with a ban on bump stocks. That is ill-conceived.
7054 2018-02-21 00:10:27 There is already a bill to ban bump stocks collecting dust in the Senate.
7055 2018-02-21 00:10:22 Devils advocate here, maybe to let it look like he (they) are trying to get something done to loosen the leftist grasp on this fight? I don't know. I think bump stocks are stupid, BUT their is no reason to go after them.
7056 2018-02-21 00:10:21 That guy is the son of an fbi agent
7057 2018-02-21 00:10:05 I hardly even know what's going on here..this started w/ me asking Hammy about bump stocks..pretty sure Sig Sauer is German though..
7058 2018-02-21 00:10:03 The Vegas shooters didn't use bump stocks idiots. 
They had full auto firearms. 
Anybody with experience around automatic weapons knows this to be true.
7059 2018-02-21 00:09:50 @SymoneDSanders @realDonaldTrump bans bump stocks. What will you find wrong with that??  Remember that congress writes laws. @POTUS can inly do so much. Obama endorsed bump stocks!!!  Check that fact! @TuckerCarlson @CNN @JesseBWatters
7060 2018-02-21 00:09:49 stick with buying stocks at all time highs .....what could gone wrong
7061 2018-02-21 00:09:40 A ban on bump stocks is a decent start. A ban on assault rifles is the more sensible -- and effective -- remedy for mass shootings
7062 2018-02-21 00:09:37 A step in the right direction but it’s not good enough. Btw, @NRA supports no bump stocks so #liarinchief is ok with it. #GunReformNow
7063 2018-02-21 00:09:30 You took your money out when stocks sored?  Loser!
7064 2018-02-21 00:09:24 It's very unfortunate that the barn door has been open on assult rifles and bump stocks.  In the when while, the Gun shows and online sales are pumping them out into the public as fast as they can make them.  Is a production freeze possible?
7065 2018-02-21 00:09:17 Not really a surprise, but Trump buckled on bump fire stocks.
7066 2018-02-21 00:08:43 And in today's example, the president asked Jeff sessions back on December whether or not bump stocks are illegal under current law. He said no, so now the president has asked sessions for proposed legislation to submit to congress outlawing them. Doesn't sound unreasonable to me
7067 2018-02-21 00:08:30 As a gun owner, I'm pretty much neutral on banning bump stocks.  Personally, I don't see the need for one.  However, banning bump stocks is only a consolation prize.  It won't change a thing.
7068 2018-02-21 00:08:12 For all those who say protesting won’t get you anywhere- Donald Trump, lord of the conservatives, just  ordered regulation to ban bump stocks. It’s a start. Keep fightin
7069 2018-02-21 00:07:59 I likely will never say this again but im actually happy that Trump requested a banning of bump-stocks. It’s a step in the right direction
7070 2018-02-21 00:07:53 It's not the bump stocks that worries. It's that it starts with them.
7071 2018-02-21 00:07:43 No, of course not. However, we need to stop selling assault rifles, bump stocks, and magazines that hold significant numbers of rounds. We have to start somewhere.
7072 2018-02-21 00:07:40 That’s the leader of the #TrumpCrimeFamily he wants to happen. He knows the ATF has already ruled on Bump Stocks. It will take your bill to make it happen. Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t.
7073 2018-02-21 00:07:20 Sarah I admire your courage and handling of the press.  Tell the President the problem isn't the bum stocks but the multi-round magazines/clips.  If you limit the magazine size to 4 (all you need to hunt) no bump stock is necessary.  Shotguns are limited to 3 to 5 shells. Gracias
7074 2018-02-21 00:07:17 My best guess is because he isn't calling for banning/registering AR's like some out here are. Millions are out here and hurt no one daily
He took a swing at bump stocks. Big deal. 
Some are out here and it's not like they are going back so I don't see the issue
7075 2018-02-21 00:07:10 Sadly most of the mass shootings didn't incorporate Bump Stocks and still created mass carnage. It's a start but so more could be done to keep semi auto rifles out of the hands of nutjobs and hateful people hell bent on killing innocent people
7076 2018-02-21 00:07:09 I find it interesting that @realDonaldTrump wants to now “consider action” on “bump stocks”. A few months too late for Nevada, but STILL not addressing the assault weapon problem. And do I believe he’ll do jack on any of it? Do You?
7077 2018-02-21 00:06:45 "President Trump directs Justice to ban anything relatd to "related) to anything related to "bump stocks" and yet how could the shooter had it on the rifle without knowing it had a roughen edge on the bottom surface.  %7% believe and 43% have an opinion they would rather keep to
7078 2018-02-21 00:06:42 Get yo Bump Stocks while u still kan
7079 2018-02-21 00:06:33 @realDonaldTrump I fully support your agenda to make bump stocks illegal. I hope you see the massive support you get for this as a reason to continue smart gun control laws. You took a step in the right direction today.
7080 2018-02-21 00:06:17 Trump suggesting we ban bump stocks is right above doing nothing in the effort level.
7081 2018-02-21 00:06:12 Good for you, in backing the ban on bump stocks @realDonaldTrump; keep going. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
7082 2018-02-21 00:06:05 Well.. increased caution and patience mainly. SPY daily swings are still sizeable and this can work with or against you on individual stocks. Has me currently hunting more bearish opportunities than usual at the moment. Also keeping a closer eye on SPY during short term entries.
7083 2018-02-21 00:06:03 Banning bump stocks as "machineguns" looks questionable, and it has to go through notice and comment. Congress could ban them tomorrow if it wanted to.
7084 2018-02-21 00:05:57 “If they take our bump stocks, our guns are next...”

Yup. That’s right. If you are a responsible gun owner who follows the rules, and can pass a background check, you won’t have any problem. If not, then yes...  we are taking your guns, numbnuts.
7085 2018-02-21 00:05:53 Unfortunately, this takes an act of congress. DOJ nor ATF have the authority to ban/regulate bump stocks. This is just fluff PR.
7086 2018-02-21 00:05:51 The announcement by Trump on Bump stocks seemed contrived and scripted out of necessity!Underestimated young students resolve & passion!Today's lame response is a year late and dozens of previous lives lost! #NeverAgain #holdthemaccountable2018 Remember their names!Vote them out!
7087 2018-02-21 00:05:45 Bump stocks equal NRA bull shit.
7088 2018-02-21 00:05:37 The one that bans bump stocks or the one that bans the sale of specific assault rifles? The shooter already owned his AR-15 as do 5 million other people and would have been able to keep it. These solutions wouldn't help what happened in Florida
7089 2018-02-21 00:05:35 Trump may have run on "draining the swamp" but his campaign finances look like any other Republican's. So far it looks like the NRA has pre-approved limits on bump stocks and enhanced background checks. The AR 15 is a cash cow, Trump's donors won't let him ban it.
7090 2018-02-21 00:05:17 Hey -It’s a start & - if Trump wants to not only outlaw bump stocks- but re-instate assault weapons ban, create 30 day waiting period, age requirement, mandatory gun training & licensing & gun registration for tracking lost / stolen weapons he can brag BIGLY & I’m OK with it
7091 2018-02-21 00:05:16 But yet President Trump is backing gun control by signing a bill against bump stocks... Unlike Obama allowing people to buy them.
7092 2018-02-21 00:05:11 昨日買ったポンイチ頑張って
ドリコムは1回休んでええんやで。
7093 2018-02-21 00:05:07 Someone needs to explain to our president the concept of separation of powers.

Congress creates and changes laws.

DOJ enforces laws.

POTUS directing DOJ to ban bump stocks is at best  a PR Stunt at worst a way to holdup a bump stock ban in the courts.
7094 2018-02-21 00:04:46 Trump just told the atf to ban bump stocks and other devices, (whatever that means). Wtf if he can’t even stick up for the 2a then I’ll be looking for a new candidate. I’ve been a trump supporter from the start but this is completely unacceptable.
7095 2018-02-21 00:04:37 Meh, I don't really care about bumper stocks, they are a quirky workaround they people can just 3D print anyways.

It was a logical gesture.
7096 2018-02-21 00:04:35 I'm thinking he had no idea what he was talking about.  He thought this was all about the bump his stocks got when he, and he alone, caused the stock market to surge, beginning several years ago.
7097 2018-02-21 00:04:21 @realDonaldTrump 
Sir, you are very wrong on Romney. 
And bump stocks? Seriously? 
Hope you're not getting DC'ed.
7098 2018-02-21 00:04:14 Bump stocks were used by the shooter in last year's deadly Las Vegas shooting spree
7099 2018-02-21 00:04:09 NRA was against the use of bump stocks also.
7100 2018-02-21 00:04:01 Don’t get upset about Trump agreeing to ban #bumpstocks. The NRA called for a ban on them after Vegas. Trump won’t go further than that, I promise you, he knows better.

Bump stocks shouldn’t be banned, but as long as that’s the only move, it’s harmless.
7101 2018-02-21 00:03:56 No.  If heaven forbid some one comes in and shoots my kids school up with an assault rifle there is no credit to give.  It took an entire new massacre to occur to get bump stocks banned.  That's not good enough.
7102 2018-02-21 00:03:51 Bump stocks are how Gorge Washington chopped down Cheri tree but now bad for America?! #thanxObama
7103 2018-02-21 00:03:47 And your more accurate in semi auto mode. Let them use the stocks less dead people
7104 2018-02-21 00:03:46 Last I checked your hero Obama oversaw 20+ shootings and sis squat and his doj found bump stocks legal?
7105 2018-02-21 00:03:40 This is the tip of the iceberg. In my opinion this is at best the very least we can do. Surely we can go further then bump stocks. This makes me think your in with the @NRA John
7106 2018-02-21 00:03:32 Here is recommended Legislation Congress should pass that  I would support:
1- Ban bump stocks or any mod that makes a semi-automatic weapon replicate an automatic weapon.
2- Increase age to purchase ANY gun or ammo to 21 (Unless military or law enforcement).
MORE...
7107 2018-02-21 00:03:13 It's frustrating you're moving the country in the right direction & people finally get to see that but now you're getting derailed by guns. Ignore NRA. 77% of America wants tighter gun control $ wants semi-assault weapons banned. Bump stocks aren't enough. LISTEN. Be brave.
7108 2018-02-21 00:03:11 Ban bump stocks?  
But to clarify: Isn’t a bumpstock-ban-by-fiat the kind of  “executive overreach” Trump supposedly opposed #DACA for?

Let’s demand actual LEGISLATION — the kind that doesn’t expire as the #AssaultWeaponsBan did.

#ParklandSchoolShooting
7109 2018-02-21 00:03:10 Bump stocks & echo triggers should have never been allowed by the BATFE. They make a good weapon system unreliable and inaccurate. The problem is all administrations put folks into powerful SES/GS positions who know nothing about the agencies they are running.
7110 2018-02-21 00:03:06 Banning Bump Stocks is NOT gun control.

It's not a BAD thing, but it's NOT ENOUGH.
7111 2018-02-21 00:03:04 Also keep your bump stocks not accurate at all just like full auto used for suppression fire anyways
7112 2018-02-21 00:02:59 Ban bump stocks?  
But to clarify: Isn’t a bumpstock-ban-by-fiat the kind of  “executive overreach” Trump supposedly opposed #DACA for?

Let’s demand actual LEGISLATION — the kind that doesn’t expire as the #AssaultWeaponsBan did.

#ParklandSchoolShooting
7113 2018-02-21 00:02:55 I'm not for Gun control... President Trump is right about bump stocks...
7114 2018-02-21 00:02:52 Bump stocks makes no sense for any experienced shooter. 
Absolutely no aim for a magazine that is 10 rounds. 

Also Trump only asked DOJ for clarification, no official ban yet.
7115 2018-02-21 00:02:52 Which freedoms do AR-15s and bump stocks protect for you exactly?
7116 2018-02-21 00:02:45 People forgot about the Vegas shooting already and it took the latest Florida School shooting for Trump to now direct Sessions to “propose” a ban on bump stocks. How much power does the NRA have over politicians?
7117 2018-02-21 00:02:45 One significant omission must be stated; namely, owning a home “freezes” your monthly housing cost, which in turn frees the owner to invest more in stocks. An owner of 20 + years pays half in housing compared to a current renter. Who can afford to invest more?
7118 2018-02-21 00:02:37 The person playing "President" is another paid  whore of the domestic terror group NRA.  He might play with the idea of eliminating bump stocks so as not to ban assault rifles from killing our children and fellow Americans.
7119 2018-02-21 00:02:33 Obama admin ok'd the sale of bump stocks & NRA has asked ATF to review if legal...don't be a mindless parrot.
7120 2018-02-21 00:02:32 Let's throw some cold reality on #Thump's stemming BS about bump stocks,the Congress writes bills that turns into law!AG Sessions  enforcement of the law is his job!From Florida to DC Republicans are donor prostitutes for the NRA,#Thump has trickery for the kids coming to DC!
7121 2018-02-21 00:02:30 That was the path of least resistance and will bring no opposition. What needs banned are the assault rifles idiots use bump stocks on.
7122 2018-02-21 00:02:27 Suggestion that after Parkland we only ban bump stocks is a giant dog whistle to the NRA: not used in Parkland, everybody knows it. We need a ban, but this is totally insufficient (not a year from now) and doesn't wash away complicity in this tragedy, GOP. Time to go. #NeverAgain
7123 2018-02-21 00:02:19 European stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by a weaker euro on reports the EU was preparing its own plan for Brexit, with the UK to possibly be given 'special associate' status. BNP Paribas rose 0.7%, @Airbus jumped 2.2%, and @RollsRoyce Royce gained 1.4%.
7124 2018-02-21 00:02:07 Setting up for another run is $SQ.  Base looks very similar to Oct '98 bases in $schw, $aol (no longer) formed during a sharp mkt correction #stocks #leaders
7125 2018-02-21 00:01:54 Outlawing bump stocks is good but it’s about 2% of what really needs to be done. This is scraps, trump and the gop may do to give appearance of taking action.
7126 2018-02-21 00:01:53 Trump wants to ban Bump Stocks ? How the hell does this address the AR-15 assault rifle used in these massacres ??!! He's trying dig out of an avalanche with a thimble. Moron !
7127 2018-02-21 00:01:45 Here’s why prayers & condolences aren’t enough. Gun control action needs to be taken. Florida, where the shooting happened, just proved they don’t care about the well being of their kids. Here in WA state we have banned bump stocks (before Trump) & looking at doing more.
7128 2018-02-21 00:01:40 New kid in the block, I am exciting about  the stocks market, today I made my first profit, in GEN, in at 1:47 and out at 1:59.5, Thanks# tImothysykes@.com.
7129 2018-02-21 00:01:36 So we also agree that the assault weapons ban should be reinstated. Probably agree that bump stocks should be banned and background check system notably improved. But do you really believe that puts an end to mass shootings? That there are no other causes?
7130 2018-02-21 00:01:33 Time for true talk! #Gunsand Gunaccassories with all the gossip, when are we going to talk about home built guns and home made "bump stocks" or foreign made smuggled guns, I.e., Ak47. Ar15, etc.
7131 2018-02-21 00:01:33 The assault rifle ban that Clinton enacted did not result in homeade bombs.  It did lower the death rate from shootings.  I just cant justify any automatic assault rifles or bump stocks.  Those aren't hunting tools, there just isn't valid reason to have AR 15, AK57 etc
7132 2018-02-21 00:01:25 Trump is vain, if we praise him for putting pressure on bump stocks, he will bam guns just for the good press.
7133 2018-02-21 00:01:12 @realDonaldTrump What a man of courage and courageous concern about our youth you are!! Imagine you asking sweaty Jeff to write a decree banning gun stocks. The most amazing abandonment of the second amendment imaginable. Don't be surprised to see your face on Mount Rushmore.
7134 2018-02-21 00:00:54 やっぱ4時くらいの見てないと駄目なんだな。
7135 2018-02-21 00:00:50 Correct. Bump Stocks should have been banned immediately after the Las  Vegas shooting.
7136 2018-02-21 00:00:49 US stocks fell on Tuesday, dragged down by Walmart post its results and a US$179 billion auction of Treasury notes that pushed short-term bond yields to near-decade highs.
7137 2018-02-21 00:00:49 Would love if our officers didn’t have to face criminals who are armed with literal killing machines as they attempt to enforce said laws. In time, I suppose. 

Banning bump stocks, can we all get behind that?
7138 2018-02-21 00:00:41 @realDonaldTrump  suddenly has interest in banning Bump Stocks. You know this is a distraction. Florida Students blasting his ass.
7139 2018-02-21 00:00:41 Serious question: How many ppl have been killed in the history of this country by someone using AR-15's with #bumpstocks? Like 58? We have a very serious gun problem in this country. Sick of focusing on the stupid shit, background checks, bump stocks. We need real reform.
7140 2018-02-21 00:00:30 Trump says he signed a directive to Attorney General Sessions to outline regulations to ban #BumpStocks .
It's a band-aid solution.
Bump stocks weren't used in #Parkland and most other shootings.
America needs a permanent assault rifle ban & universal background checks. #2A #maga
7141 2018-02-21 00:00:24 RT Bayonet Forest DDPAT FT GIVEAWAY RT I would like to ban 'bump stocks'
7142 2018-02-21 00:00:16 Yes, thank you for “facilitating” the ban of bump stocks.
7143 2018-02-21 00:00:16 It’s been all looked at before. ATF can’t do anything about enforcing bump stocks bans.  They need a law to address and the legislative branch has abdicated its responsibilities #neveragain #istodaytheday
7144 2018-02-21 00:00:15 Hey bro, this is another deflection; although one of some significance. Significant because bump stocks need to be illegal but irrelevant to the cause of #ParklandSchoolShooting 
7145 2018-02-21 00:00:09 One step at a time. Everyone wanted bump stocks outlawed after Vegas. Now no one is pleased it’s been done? Trump wanted a talking point, “I banned bump stocks.”, and if that’s what he gets for doing the right thing, he can have it ... and we keep hammering the other issues.
7146 2018-02-21 00:00:02 The #markets are unforgiving, and emotional #trading always results in losses. #forex #stocks
