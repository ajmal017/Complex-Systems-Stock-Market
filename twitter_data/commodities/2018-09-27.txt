40 2018-09-27 22:46:12 I wish I could agree with you. I'm sure you understand the concept of 'diminishing returns' in consumptn of commodities (demand). There is only one commodity on the planet that exhibits the opposite trait (increasing marginal utility); MONEY! The more you get, the more you want!
41 2018-09-27 22:43:14 Mariah the commodities sales agent is in the house but is stone cold stunned into a coma by Jessica Lowndes.
42 2018-09-27 22:42:21 Even if Minimum wage is 100k and prices of commodities are still high 

I don’t see any sense
43 2018-09-27 22:35:23 In regards to the price of commodities, the rise of wages operates as simple interest does, the rise of profit operates like compound interest. 

Our merchants and masters complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price and lessening the sale of goods.
44 2018-09-27 22:33:41 Y como logras deficit cero en un pais con una balanza comercial negativisima que solo exporta commodities (cuyo precio internacional baja), sin desarrollo industrial, con una concentracion demografica incoherente y con un sistema impositivo basado unicamente en su recaudabilidad?
45 2018-09-27 22:31:14 And how sure are we that if Minimum wage is increased from N18,000 to N50,000 that the Price of stock in the market,price of small house commodities and utilities will not increase too....... Its all a circle,increased salary=Increased market price... #Stake
46 2018-09-27 22:28:43 To be faire i'm sad for 1broker.
I was trading commodities there. 
47 2018-09-27 22:23:09 Nass is killing Nigeria so bad but people are focused on presidency 

Make angel come rule us with our kind nass, we go still Dey backward...as per minimum wage, all we need is to beat prices of commodities down so people can live and save comfortably on 10-20k per month 

IMO!
48 2018-09-27 22:21:24 Y no usa tc, sino p internacionales de los commodities. Tampoco usa el y del resto del mundo, sino absorción interna de la argentina. Y finalmente el período es muy diferente. En definitiva, es un buen articulo pero los resultados no son del todo comparables.
49 2018-09-27 22:15:10 “What are commodities Alex?”....that’s right for $420.
50 2018-09-27 22:14:34 Shane, after the referendum the pound dropped against a basket of currencies by 15%, including the dollar, most commodities are priced in dollars, oil for example is 5p a litre more than it should be. A 400 gram  packet of shelled walnuts imported from America is 10% higher.
51 2018-09-27 22:13:22 Antonio is a  commodities sales agent that likes Cocktail sauce on their tomatoe pizza with cognac
52 2018-09-27 22:10:43 Why can't 1broker be a dapp?  Isn't it essentially just a Bitcoin gambling site revolving around the price of stocks and commodities?
53 2018-09-27 21:54:36 .@SecretarySonny highlights hydroponics and tapping into the farm to fork movement as ways farmers should diversify beyond just bulk commodities. That was unexpected but I couldn’t agree more. It’s something we discuss often at the @UTagandfood. #WSJFood

55 2018-09-27 21:51:49 What we forget always when issue of minimum wage pop up is price control, there is no price control in this country, the moment there is increment in minimum wage booooom commodities sky rocket
56 2018-09-27 21:45:45 i could love my whole life without basic commodities as long as i can get as much affection as i want
57 2018-09-27 21:41:47 taking art that was literally created to criticize capitalism & turning them into commodities like overpriced key chains or beach towels is pEAK irony i wish i could say sorry to these artists
58 2018-09-27 21:41:31 Great review. Recall that push by Howard in detail. #neoliberalism again. Patients as clients/consumers /commodities. Anything but a patient to whom a duty of care is owed. When one resiled from these descriptions there was derision of not meeting "change" @chrisegginton

62 2018-09-27 21:30:00 Soybean prices may have bottomed out — or at least it certainly feels like it, according to a commodities analyst and broker. While prices may not fully recover as #China continues to shun U.S. imports, there could be enough demand bright spots to regain half the ground.

64 2018-09-27 21:25:59 i think diary-keeping and commiseration can be very useful but the people who run the platforms and tbh most of our institutions really are just using us as commodities. the plum gigs are still gonna go to all their prep school buddies.
65 2018-09-27 21:25:10 Here's the challenge, the government increase minimum wage, the market and every business person would increase price of commodities,  and we back to square one.
66 2018-09-27 21:23:21 It probably is fair to ask whether population growth leads to extra demand for all services & commodities. It does! And this growth is welcome because history tends to show that it leads to prosperity. The new population doesn’t have to be foreign, but very often better if it is.
67 2018-09-27 21:22:27 Some sectors will be prominent than others thats a norm variable come in play too. How markets behave particularly for commodities.  What can't be content is a more overall growth several sectors was noted and that makes a case.

70 2018-09-27 21:00:27 All irrelevant commodities in the end Mr Paul.
The currency in all civilisations is people, humans and what they contribute.
These commodities that you speak of, merely assist in the enslavement of people and the concentration of wealth and power.
71 2018-09-27 20:48:50 I’ve been enjoying the low cost of commodities, much more than I would of you were elected. Thank God we dodged that bullet. Surely having a Preimer Horwath would have been the final nail in Ontario’s coffin.
72 2018-09-27 20:43:23 A realistic, balanced home management advisor is seduced by a funny, delicate commodities sales agent.
73 2018-09-27 20:36:47 But "crypto assets" are not the same as "cryptocurrencies" (trusting you've carried fwd the precise language).

It also is not new/surprising, in  the context you've outlined (IE, the interpretation that they are commodities already has consensus, so this is not unexpected.)
74 2018-09-27 20:30:38 Want to know price updates on commodities in Nigeria?
75 2018-09-27 20:19:44 Securities are a subset of commodities - I could see a division of labor scenario where the SEC enforces against ICO fraud, while the CFTC addresses the remaining other scenarios that involve tokens that might not be securities. The CFTC's Part 180 + SEC's 10b5 are v. similar.
76 2018-09-27 20:18:41 @theresa_may I want the funds from our commodities pumped into health, education & jobs for working class. Do it it not, then one of your Cabinet shall be exposed for sleeping with prostitutes, your Judges sniffing Cocaine.....
77 2018-09-27 20:12:17 The SEC has opened a case against Tesla CEO Elon Musk. According to the docket, securities/commodities is the reason.
78 2018-09-27 20:04:02 Danault is a low-tier 2nd line C, the rest are not exactly tested or known of as NHL commodities
79 2018-09-27 20:03:50 I believe what makes it inhuman is the value it can get for you. History has taught us that the more the increase in the price of something, the likelihood that the prices of other commodities will increase in Nigeria. Not everyone works for the government.
80 2018-09-27 20:00:30 CFTC is well suited to reg OTC commodities b/c frauds in OTC markets are equivalent to those in futures. Prosecuting binary options, swaps fraud, manipulations, etc is what CFTC does. Utility token models have similar attributes to commodities-can be bought to consume or invest
81 2018-09-27 20:00:09 Y'all: fuck capitalism, fuck corporations, fuck commodities

83 2018-09-27 19:44:26 So you think positive rates no big deal given Trump's spending. Which sectors do you think will be notably stronger/weaker year over year going forward? Personally, I cld see Europe & Japan & commodities outperforming over next 6 months--rebalancing.

86 2018-09-27 19:41:18 Smoldering take: I think you could make an argument that there are dozens of pass catchers “defenseless” on plays every game that get lit up and aren’t flagged b/c there was no helmet involved. It’s about protecting commodities not players. And it’s all just stupid.
87 2018-09-27 19:39:50 It's basically a big warehouse... The price of commodities there should drop a little though
88 2018-09-27 19:38:51 No..think markets remain optimistic that all of this trade crap will resolve itself. If you look at sectors..and commodities..it’s a different story. Don’t be fooled by major market indices.
89 2018-09-27 19:37:19 Yes. That’s right. Sold these mortgages as A + when they were actually C- commodities. Dirty tricks that destroyed economies of towns in Italy, Norway and others.

99 2018-09-27 19:04:20 The Bible treats women as second class citizens, property, walking wombs, commodities, human shields, scapegoats, sex toys, political bargaining chips and bait for cons. I find it a poor guide for how we should be treated.

124 2018-09-27 17:57:06 Thatcher introduced the cap with right to buy. The whole plan was to kill public housing and turn homes into commodities on the market. The result? Housing to buy is out of reach for many, ex-council homes are being rented at more than twice council rents from private landlords.

134 2018-09-27 17:22:04 Quais drivers para alta em commodities voce ta vendo ? Perguntando de boa mesmo. Fui recentemente em uma palestra de um diretor da CME e o cara tava pessimista. Falando que desaceleração china e puxada nos juros do EUA iam derrubar demanda e jogar commodities pra baixo
135 2018-09-27 17:20:01 I... I just saw a tweet whining about after receiving R10, how long of a break will she take before releasing another album? Hun. That's a special level of ungrateful. Also, another example of ppl seeing artists as commodities and not actual ppl who need to live their own lives.

141 2018-09-27 16:52:13 Nope. Our society really view women as disposable commodities.
142 2018-09-27 16:49:51 She was not assaulted in this way multiple times. These are either liars or demonstrations that @GOP men don’t actually see women as individuals, but as commodities to be used. “All the same” and OK to use like this.
143 2018-09-27 16:45:01 But then why do these women make themselves commodities and dance on item numbers? For money, fame! & why presumptions that only women get abused, what abt men newcomers, strugglers? Why can’t rules b same 4 evryone? There r many unanswered questions which will remain unanswered
144 2018-09-27 16:43:13 It is people like you don't have the masses @heart with stupid post like this..If they can't pay then they should regulate price of commodities or make market for the poor...Useless post

148 2018-09-27 16:25:57 I am very interested in commodities production as well. And yes, I think industry and government understandings are the default equilibrium as well.

202 2018-09-27 13:13:27 The only reason the NLC is fighting for more wage is bcos the current one cannot purchase enough commodities in the market. So if the Fed. Government cannot afford to pay the increment demanded, then they shud atleast make the current wage have more purchasing power.

229 2018-09-27 10:54:19 The only “gulo” i’m seeing right now are the prices of the commodities. Magkaka-gulo talaga if the government will not address this immediately. I hope the gov’t will focus on the REAL problem.
230 2018-09-27 10:50:25 The government had some investments in gold and other commodities which weren’t giving a decent return Brown sold some if them and used proceeds to make other investments such as foreign bonds

239 2018-09-27 09:54:46 In my own perspective, embarking on nationwide strike is not the remedy for solution. FGN should regulate the prices of goods and commodities that will be affordable for the citizens to purchase at ease. There should be a framework in actualising the process.

241 2018-09-27 09:43:00 Minimum wage or not the issue is that government should regulate prices of commodities in the market and cut down both monthly take home and allowances of our Lawbreakers....Lawmakers and make National Assembly unattractive.

the problem in the market of information products,
Information is a new kind of commodities that still do not have a correct business model and price.

258 2018-09-27 08:27:03 In the context of market making, credit access can be achieved by increasing liquidity in the capital markets, like peanut butter holding jelly, by setting up a commodities exchange this will accelerate growth, stability creating tremendous opportunities for borrowers & lenders.

260 2018-09-27 08:19:08 I think there is a fine line publishers tread between marketing books as commodities, and as literary works. In so doing they may miss the trick on both sides, children’s books undervalued, lack of reviews in the press etc, but on the other side also missing promo opportunities.

284 2018-09-27 07:13:06 The prime minister @narendramodi was very fond of fault finding with the Centre over price rise when he was chief minister. Now as Prime Minister he is tongue tied when soaring prices of essential commodities, petrol,diesel and cooking gas are touching an all-time high.

286 2018-09-27 07:02:32 I do hope we all realize that the moment this new minimum wage is approved, the prices of commodities will double even triple. So we will be back to square 1.
287 2018-09-27 07:02:17 Do u labour under the belief that any M'sian govt can influence commodities prices? Prove it by concrete examples!
288 2018-09-27 07:01:00 M'sia is not the US!  Unfortunately!   Which commodities prices can M'sia influence? Crude oil? Natural gas? Palm oil? Rubber? Where is it a dominant supplier? Go read up on "price setters" & "price takers".
289 2018-09-27 06:59:33 Gaming companies also bypass the SEC in the way they sell crates. As virtual commodities become more valuable it raises the question of whether they are in fact considered securities and fall under certain regulations. This would require licensing and becomes very tricky.

The boomers can't cash out. The bankers gave them fiat money that you cannot as a bulk group exchange for commodities. That's why they hand it out like confetti.
346 2018-09-27 00:27:09 Si efectivamente es eso, tiene sentido que países exportadores de commodities estén en la parte más alta de la tabla. Se necesita capital y trabajo para producirlo, pero no un porcentaje muy alto de insumos.
347 2018-09-27 00:26:21 im getting that impression Usd will keep sliding into Q4. it doesn’t always happen, but usually when commodities start going up, the dollar weakens. after the fed announced the hike today, dollar was pretty flat. that’s bearish to me.
348 2018-09-27 00:22:14 In the last few weeks, both the CFTC and SEC have had US district courts ratify their views that cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to the CFTC’s anti-fraud authority, and that ICO-issued tokens could be securities and subject to the SEC’s anti-fraud authority...
