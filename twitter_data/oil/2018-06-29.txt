38 2018-06-30 23:56:56 Definitely would not say fire him for it. I'm more supportive of Chia than many Oil fans. But I did not like spending that much cap on an NHL unproven goalie. I preferred waiting to see what is out there as we might be able to get an NHL proven guy for that money or possibly less
39 2018-06-30 23:56:52 Saudi Arabia has now denied even speaking to Trump about oil. His Lying has reached a new level of crazy.
40 2018-06-30 23:56:48 What happened.....? That darn.oil leak?
41 2018-06-30 23:56:41 Your career wouldn’t have been possible without oil!! Specifically jet fuel for you to travel for mr Olympia, why do you hate the poor and want to kill their chances??
42 2018-06-30 23:56:35 Add extra tariffs on the oil Canada is pumping through Mn. Now they want to build a new line. Why cant the pump the oil through there own country instead of   Polluting Mn?

45 2018-06-30 23:56:04 You pulled out of Iran deal to reward Saudi, AbuDhabi, et al, your personal business partners, so they can monopolize oil supply. We know your scheme.

47 2018-06-30 23:55:54 It chops up birds. It is intermittent. And guess what lubricates the things - lots and lots of oil.
48 2018-06-30 23:55:54 At this point in their careers it's about cementing their legacy with their club team. If either Argentina or Portugal become a powerhouse, which I dont see happening, they'd play but that's unlikely. Ronaldo may play in one more Euro but even that is iffy. They need their rest.

64 2018-06-30 23:53:04 And now comes the #whataboutism.

We've established that Nazis weren't socialists so you leap into "yeah, well what about".

Yes, Venezuela followed a socialist model. But they failed to diversify their trade and the economy collapsed when oil prices dropped 70%.

Nice try.
65 2018-06-30 23:52:56 He did confirm it by actually doing it. They are now at maximum oil production. Meaning they cant do any more. Check your facts.
66 2018-06-30 23:52:43 No that’s right - but he’s doing it to protect his constituents and ensure high oil prices don’t undermine the economy
67 2018-06-30 23:52:14 I thought India declared this past week that they would not abide by unilateral sanctions and only by U.N. sanctions? Also Europe is looking into laws to prevent their companies from complying. And then there’s the black market... not sure there will be such a reduction of oil.
68 2018-06-30 23:52:08 Oil changes, brakes replaced, wiring problem let me know I got you starting next month. I’m back

70 2018-06-30 23:51:58 I've been in the habit of drinking a lot of water all the time since middle school, so whenever I see people talking about needing to drink more water, I just feel so healthy. I'm like the poster for health.

71 2018-06-30 23:51:43 And a bit of snake oil . It is easier for a rich person to appease one’s conscience by soaking in a poor country’s tears of salt than for a poor person to have the doors of prosperity open by greedy nations.

85 2018-06-30 23:50:10 I like to stir fry it. Start w/ some veg oil, add some garlic & ginger. Remove the g & g after a bit (before they burn, just to flavor the oil). Add chopped up bok choy, after it’s cooked dow, remove from heat. In a cup, mix soy sauce, sesame oil & a pinch of sugar. Pour over.

116 2018-06-30 23:44:20 I agree, which trump has done by expanding oil and gas production. I don’t believe the government should control that stuff but it’s the way it is. We can sit back and dream in our libertarian utopian thoughts, or work with the system we have.
117 2018-06-30 23:44:18 Main thing is always compare apples to apples. $0 down & only 1st month & DMV fees down payment. I shopped around took the lowest price I was given & said Dealer X offered ($30 less than they really did). Can you match that price & throw in rubber mats & a few free oil changes?

125 2018-06-30 23:43:33 Trump just asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production cause the price per barrel is getting to expensive.  What’s your plan when the oil price craters again.  I can hardly wait for the next election . You and Trudeau will be having a holiday in India together
126 2018-06-30 23:43:11 ...Ghawar field which is KSA's biggest field has to have millions of gallons of sea water pumped into one side of the field to keep the pressure going for the oil fields to work on the other side. In the near future KSA will have a hard time keeping level production...

134 2018-06-30 23:42:09 why oil field workers gotta be so loud for
135 2018-06-30 23:42:07 Thatcher wasn't also to blame for the 18% inflation in 1980. That was the 2nd oil shock of 1979. Just as Labour weren't to blame in 1975 as it was from the oil shock of 1973 and the Barber Boom
136 2018-06-30 23:42:06 Use our own oil, and refine it ourselves.  Now, THAT would be in the interest of national security!
137 2018-06-30 23:41:53 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

141 2018-06-30 23:41:38 I HAVE to get my oil change done Monday
142 2018-06-30 23:41:38 True for line 9 and that's of course the whole point because that's where we want to sell our oil.  You get that the pipelines are connected to Alberta right?

The Enbridge upgrades increased our capacity to export oil to PADD II in the US.  

Too bad about the Gateway reversal!
143 2018-06-30 23:41:32 Need some oil to get that good sizzle going 
144 2018-06-30 23:41:10 Well peak oil is a thing and it's occurring now. I hint at it in my tweet. If Trump thinks he can shut off sources of oil and other countries can pick up the slack he is in for a rude awakening. KSA has been pumping 10+ million barrels a day for decades...
145 2018-06-30 23:41:05 Consider this tho add in some kinda like ??? Roasted pine Nuts maybe a sprinkle of olive oil

151 2018-06-30 23:40:26 Don't forget to crate your dog, inside the house, and turn on some music or the TV to drown out the fireworks noise this weekend. Also we have plenty of Happy Traveler and CBD oil to help calm them down too!
152 2018-06-30 23:40:21 absolutely right. why? coal and oil donates more to the LNP than farmers and shoppers #insiders
153 2018-06-30 23:40:18 I just drank oil in my dreams didnkefnkdcjkemdk
154 2018-06-30 23:40:06 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
155 2018-06-30 23:39:55 Our two cats occasionally get kitty cabin fever in the winter - they get cranky with each other, hissing and spitting. I have found that lavender oil has a calming effect on cats. A bit wafted around or a tiny bit dotted on bedding seems to settle things. Maybe dogs too?
156 2018-06-30 23:39:31 The employee guys at the dealership were ohhhhh boy. They could have all checked my oil with their dipsticks.
157 2018-06-30 23:39:31 I can go on about this but the point is there will be a market for oil & no government European or American will be willing to let the world slide to recession just so the militias of Libya get paid
158 2018-06-30 23:39:03 Roasting up some cauliflower with olive oil and ras el hanout, and I'm pretty sure this is what heaven smells like.
159 2018-06-30 23:38:30 Two major recessions, the early eighties and one that started in 1990.

Selling British industries to foreigners, a process that is carrying on today.

Squandering the revenue from north sea oil to pay for the dogma of her policies.

Presyo ng LPG, tumaas… Panibagong oil price increase, asahan na ngayong unang linggo ng Hulyo
161 2018-06-30 23:38:13 How rich was Libya then , it was search for water through deep drilling that raise the hope for oil prospect in Libya. It is not about population .
162 2018-06-30 23:38:13 The Saudi’s do not agree with you over the oil.  Maybe you need hearing aids?  First North Korea, wrong information  re Dear leader. And now Saudi’s say they never told you such a thing. Two big whoppers back to back. So maybe you’re telling Big whoppers.
163 2018-06-30 23:37:40 What difference would a promise from National make to you?

Why is fossil fuel exploration a good idea?

Where will you go fishing when the sea is polluted and oil is washing up on your coastline?

THAT is the point.
164 2018-06-30 23:37:37  Don't get any oil on ur pants, ruining them

167 2018-06-30 23:37:13 I am a robot. I piss oil
168 2018-06-30 23:37:12 pota I need ginger oil for this sore throat... may natututunan din naman ako sa hayop na botany na yan e
169 2018-06-30 23:36:56 How about this, let's put efforts into reducing the number of bird kills rather than tearing it all down and just burning oil?  Sound reasonable?
170 2018-06-30 23:36:55 and then all the poses he does, the fact he always makes sure to get a bottle out and oil up when matches start, literally a crime

173 2018-06-30 23:36:25 Why don't we just use American Oil ? We don't need foreign oil !
174 2018-06-30 23:36:11 Oof. Atleast there is no oil yet, and all our mines except the one on the north pole will be shut down soon. Our country would fall in the hands of the centrist welfare programs after the war anyways, fascism wont change much except for the government size.

You achieved nothing.
175 2018-06-30 23:36:02 Never forget that @LexiBiloxi referred to herself as a burn victim after we made fried chicken and she got sauced by the oil

178 2018-06-30 23:35:13 So here's a post for yall girls dealing with period cramps I have the answer for you: peppermint oil is a literal godsend. I used to struggle with severe cramps for years and certiand pain killers kinda worked but peppermint oil works the best. Thank me later girls
179 2018-06-30 23:35:11 Malcom, Russia has little to offer  been to St. Petersburg. All they have to export is oil  &Gas the ruble is in the Tower. This is why they resort to hacking
180 2018-06-30 23:35:10 Americans clearly never learn how this CIA BS. works. Y'all keep on falling for this same fucker  y over and over again. Now innocent people will be killed in Iran coz of the military industrial complex and the oil corps who have Neo-Cons in their pockets.
181 2018-06-30 23:35:01 Some of this increase is because of  taking Iranian  oil back off the market.
182 2018-06-30 23:34:59 Is Gull Island oil real or bllshit?
183 2018-06-30 23:34:55 its #2. #3 is a qualification of #2 and acknowledgement of evidence suggesting that some pufas e.g. corn oil may be less optimal. its a nuanced doc but its anti sfa pro pufa with qualifications. read all relevant sections. its pretty clear.
184 2018-06-30 23:34:47 I think it’s inflammation that does that. Try CBD oil it helps.
185 2018-06-30 23:34:40  this is funny , you know your room was on fire, i was burning out phela, your oil heater is too much hey.couldn't help it

188 2018-06-30 23:34:06 BUT. Crucially I want England as a neighbour not a master. WM threatening 20 years of devolution. It's not a union. Oil apart, Scotland has enviable resources and will make a success of Indy. No one denies this. We are not uniquely incapable of running our own country.
189 2018-06-30 23:34:05 find me dancing to washed out in my living room while cooking up some garlic oil to cut out FODMAPs from my diet and researching fruit shrub recipes

193 2018-06-30 23:33:26 I think I put too much oil in the lawn mower. I assume more gas is the answer.
194 2018-06-30 23:33:25 My Shea butter mix has way too much oil in it...I’m sliding all over the chair
195 2018-06-30 23:33:22 We are in the oil business not the farm business, peasants
196 2018-06-30 23:33:17 I'm in! Let's Turkish oil wrestle!
197 2018-06-30 23:33:00 As an oilfield worker prices are not too high. Any lower and we face another bust and many jobs lost. American oil from American soil.
198 2018-06-30 23:33:00 I hope you guys don't take like half my tweets too seriously, a lot of the time I say stupid shit when I'm on CBD oil lol
199 2018-06-30 23:32:34 I dont want them separated at all. I want them returned within days to wherever they came from as a family.
200 2018-06-30 23:32:13 so arizona made edibles, wax, cbd and thc oil illegal but it’s legal to buy the flower. everything that my mom uses to treat her cancer is now illegal. STOP GIVING MARIJUANA A BAD NAME WHEN IT DOES NO HARM
201 2018-06-30 23:32:00 Im depressed I literally got oil a month ago and the mechanic said thats the lowest amount of miles he’s ever seen thats engine got blown he doesn’t even know how it happen

203 2018-06-30 23:31:49 I am about to start the KETO diet and I have tried the CBD oil. The CBD oil has helped but my body took a very long time to get used to it.
204 2018-06-30 23:31:28 Most Hello Fresh recipes tell u to put olive oil in the pan before cooking the meat. Well i didn't read the recipe and this time it was butter.
 i have a good feeling I won't know how to cook when I get my own place..
205 2018-06-30 23:31:25 I would do eggs with avocado oil and bacon then for lunch I would do fatty burger patties with bacon cheese and avacado then dinner I would do fry some chicken with almond flour. Shit like that you just gotta get creative lol
206 2018-06-30 23:31:21 10% crude oil 90% coloring
207 2018-06-30 23:30:55 Well, he cares about the oil...

209 2018-06-30 23:30:45 Lol unfortunately she can't block God ai
210 2018-06-30 23:30:26 @realDonaldTrump - Why would you want the Saudis to pump more oil? That would devalue the ruble. Think about it - if you can.
211 2018-06-30 23:30:25 Hahaha. Im thinking of doing it again. Heres the thing. Mag cge silag ask nako which is ma apil siya. That i needed sometimes to ask him so. Palimot2 ko ako manghud ako suguon na lang. In fact, gusto nila nag mag usa mig balah ug balik. Kaming tanan sa ako igsoon. Kapait
212 2018-06-30 23:30:23 Being poor, having little opportunity or living in a country with little rule of law doesnt qualify for asylum. Nobody gets across without paying. $5,000 or more a head to support cartels. You're not interested in facts though.
213 2018-06-30 23:30:20 the claim that Obama really does something good. I'd say it is based on no grounds. Did the oil ministry), or the "government" ever had any.
214 2018-06-30 23:30:12 Best thing that happened to me today was my mom letting me know that she was gonna pay for my car oil change 
215 2018-06-30 23:30:11 Stupendous!  I got just under 1000 shares of $DRIP, i.e., a 3X shorted ETF comprised of select S&P 500 oil companies.  As their market capital goes down, I'll make more money to fund my nefarious deeds.  Moo Ha Ha.
216 2018-06-30 23:30:09 Trump asks Saudis to boost oil production
217 2018-06-30 23:29:52 Venezuela have huge problems. Their oil revenue being taken by corporations. The previous government involved in  huge corruption charges.
Do a bit of research and stop believing the MSM and BBC .
218 2018-06-30 23:29:23 There is a real easy fix for this. If the people of Colorado don't want evil oil, withdraw all operations from the State. Shut in the wells, stuttering down all refineries, and stop all wholesale, and retail operations. 

Colorado produces 2% of US oil, we can live without it.
219 2018-06-30 23:29:14 what about MAGA and our own oil business? what’s wrong with you, or better stated - what’s right with you?
220 2018-06-30 23:28:48 grow up ,a state built on oil and a tiny population ,lucky them but dont compare to us
221 2018-06-30 23:28:46 Lara Saguisag talked about Bayou Magic, petrofiction, and the embeddedness of oil in literature. #ChLA18
222 2018-06-30 23:28:31 If you would like to know who truly calls the shots in the USA (it’s not the president) research the top Christian-Zionist bankers, oil companies, and weapons manufacturers. The US is controlled by corporations. Meaning; the US government works only to benefit the interests of...
223 2018-06-30 23:28:23 Can we stop normalizing George Bush? Cheney was really the president during that time and he lied us into war after ignoring warnings given to him, bringing about 9/11.Thousands of Americans and others died as a result of the crass incompetence and oil greediness of that admin.
224 2018-06-30 23:28:11 Congratulations! Can't wait to see you on the podium again at Road America!
225 2018-06-30 23:27:46 If one says at 50 that they have lived half their life and chances are they die in their 70s then it is much like remaining oil reserves. Bring me the enhanced. Stretcher bearers.
226 2018-06-30 23:27:16 HOW BOUT AMERICAN OIL PRODUCTION?
227 2018-06-30 23:27:07 · A place like the land before time, prehistoric. Tarantula mounds were in the field... when they're on the move they look like an oil spill. Bats, scorpions, cow ants. Armadillo. A hoot owl perches on a low branch with wise grace, accepting your admiration.
228 2018-06-30 23:27:02 I got a question for vape pen users out there. I got this brand of oil I'm not really a fan of bc it clogs & stuff, but also I got one with a sativa I love & there's oil still in there but it WILL NOT heat up. It's like it's stuck or something. Has anyone ever dealt with this?
229 2018-06-30 23:27:00 Organic black African soap+ coconut oil = glowing skin for life
230 2018-06-30 23:26:57 Customer gave me an outdoor fry pan and strainer insert for Frying on a gas burner, picked up some fresh shrimp and Cod...gonna do Onion rings to...Peanut oil...375 degrees and other thoughts or suggestions welcome....
231 2018-06-30 23:26:50 Is that the price of oil or temperatures? I can’t tell.
232 2018-06-30 23:26:31 FUCK coconut oil why would i ever put any oils on my face so i can clog my damn pores
233 2018-06-30 23:26:19 I thought the price of crude today has little to do with the price at the pump. Refineries do and after the flooding last year, I thought all the refineries were back online. Does greater oil production today have bearing on pump prices in 4 months?
234 2018-06-30 23:26:08 Someone just threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills at me.
Don't worry, I only suffered super fish oil injuries.
235 2018-06-30 23:26:06 while i was in australia i never once saw the brand australian gold sunscreen or tanning oil. i expected it to be everywhere...idk if anyone cares i just thought it was weird lol
236 2018-06-30 23:25:56 As If the oil is in yoruba land or hausa fulani land, but they in control of that, greedy people.
237 2018-06-30 23:25:52 You orchestrate the rise in oil prices and now try to make them fall by election time. Typical Republican tactic.
238 2018-06-30 23:25:44 Parliament is dissolved, caretaker government already had a charge but still fake propaganda is your first priority.. 
The prices of WTI Crude Oil & Brent Crude Oil are increased in the international market.

240 2018-06-30 23:24:54 I really wanted 5H to give me an URBAN gritty thot bop with a Music Video that was reminiscent of DC’s Lose My Breath. Just a slow motion scene with them S T R U T T I N G in unison ugh  Black outfits. Baby oil. Smokey eyes. WHYYY
241 2018-06-30 23:24:52 Lastly if they did such 13 other countries would be fucking pissed to the escalation of war.  OPEC would dissolve oil prices would plummet and the world would draw into a recession since the new price wouldn’t prop up an entire industry.
242 2018-06-30 23:24:47 Between a cat covered in oil and a planking, rolling baby with a dirty nappy, the theme of the evening has been "high stakes cleaning of wriggling angry thing"

It's been real.
243 2018-06-30 23:24:39 The 2 good things Georges has done for me in the last week is get $5 off an oil change and out of a speeding ticket
244 2018-06-30 23:24:37 someone else's path isn't going to give me answers to my own

though I may be inspired by another, I am unequivocally my own journey

A: My car has been making some weird sounds recently.
M: When’s the last time you changed your oil?
A: You have to change oil??
#dumbshitadamsays
247 2018-06-30 23:23:57 3/ but you go once a week instead of twice. Going back to oil- we cultivate new markets that appreciate what we are selling and which understand the value of decisions which have more that a single-bottom-line benefit.
248 2018-06-30 23:23:46 Were fetzer valves, ball bearings, and 30wt oil mentioned?
249 2018-06-30 23:23:39 If oil can be found in Libya, a desert , it can be found in the north. Libya oil search started in 1915 , before it was discover in 1951.
250 2018-06-30 23:23:36 You are disgraceful. Literally a snake oil salesman. Don’t you have enough material things yet? And to think you pretend to be a follower of Christ. Jesus would toss you out with the money lenders.
251 2018-06-30 23:23:06 The article you sent is also stale oil surged the day before cause the actual number was 600k.  2.  OPEC votes as an all or nothing group.  The group  has a defined market share that scales up or down on agreed production cuts.  Saudis CAN NOT just open he tap for 2 million BPD
252 2018-06-30 23:23:05 First part, yes.  Second part, no.
253 2018-06-30 23:22:54 Pretty sure, as with most things you utter, its pure . How about we stop EXPORTING our oil? Or are you not that smart.....my bad, I forgot, you, like your #MAGA cult, aren't.
254 2018-06-30 23:22:46 The only problem with this is the fact that Saudi cant raise oil output as they are running at max capacity. If they could raise it they would have done so long before now.
255 2018-06-30 23:22:38 Use Castor oil so it won't leave scars
256 2018-06-30 23:22:32 -Change your pillowcase regularly 
-Stop leaning against your hands as it causes oil transfer/buildup
-Putting hairspray on the front of your hair can cause oil buildup on your forehead 
-Regularly wash makeup brushes 
-Carry oil absorbing sheets
257 2018-06-30 23:22:17 Will they ask you what your IQ is ? Will the ask why you took credit for oil production figures when it was actually OPEQ ? Will they ask you why North Korea is still working on nuclear weapons ?
258 2018-06-30 23:22:14 Don't forget the "Coconut Oil" fund. Think of the hair! Must it suffer drying out and split ends? Please, halp.
259 2018-06-30 23:22:01 Coconut oil is for anal only, ok. 
260 2018-06-30 23:21:55 Two things real quick:
1. Obama wouldn’t have begged the Saudis, he built the US’s independence on foreign oil
2. BSM controls Saudi Arabia, you spoke to the wrong guy
261 2018-06-30 23:21:51 Came for a $40 oil change and ran into $250 problems 
262 2018-06-30 23:21:34 Recently my friends and I visited the mall. One of them has a peanut allergy. At the five guys, there’s a big disclaimer saying the fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil. My friend with the allergy orders the fries, and eats them.
263 2018-06-30 23:21:28 that may explain the Saudi Arabia oil production misperceived agreement too. Maybe it actually was a gas station  attendant from Exxon.
264 2018-06-30 23:21:27 I won't complain about the heat because right now I don't have to buy oil for my house and there's no snow on the ground. Thank you Lord of Summer

266 2018-06-30 23:21:13 oil paint.....  pssshhhhh.  So so disappointed in you trying to be a well rounded artist when it doesn't fit MY narrative. 
267 2018-06-30 23:21:13 I'm curious, regardless of the type of epilepsy, have you tried some type of alternative therapy (CBD Oil, Ketogenic diet, Yoga, etc) to help manage your seizures? #livingwellchat  Yoga has always helped me
268 2018-06-30 23:21:10 I know I need to follow rules but I am not wearing sunscreen! I want to be tan lined up!  I put on baby oil gel so it can cook on my skin 
269 2018-06-30 23:20:10 
270 2018-06-30 23:20:04 Balor Brand Baby Oil?
271 2018-06-30 23:19:35 So prices of oil go down.
272 2018-06-30 23:19:34 The TOBACCO industry said it was safe, not doctors or scientists.  BIG OIL wants you to think climate change is false, not scientists.

Dude, the science is so simple that either you get it, or you just like to be a contrarian.  I'm thinking it's the latter.
273 2018-06-30 23:19:30 Looks like he does good work. Gotta get my oil changed soon also
274 2018-06-30 23:19:22 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
275 2018-06-30 23:19:21 When I got the GT500, I wasn't sure if my dad had ever actually changed the oil in it. I was a little scared because it had 11K miles on it. It has full synth Motorcraft, so feeling better about how these high end oils protect.
276 2018-06-30 23:19:19 maybe that's what's missing: space
277 2018-06-30 23:19:13 I need another oil change 
278 2018-06-30 23:19:13 Mother Earth will become barren.  Then what? Leave the damn oil in the ground!!!  Renewable energy is the ONLY solution.
279 2018-06-30 23:18:34 No unless you are sweating. Washing your hair strips it of natural oils and messes with the pH of your scale which can lead to over production of oil in the scalp. Only wash your hair when needed.
280 2018-06-30 23:18:34 I need some baby oil
281 2018-06-30 23:18:33 Dropping oil price, lowering income for oil sales.
282 2018-06-30 23:18:26 All you are trying to do is steel the oil like you sad on campaign
Such a thief I hope Muller puts it in charges.
283 2018-06-30 23:18:01 Imagine if efforts were made to not have to rely on oil at all. Something cheaper, cleaner perhaps.
284 2018-06-30 23:17:56 Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't a massive increase in Oil production send oil prices plummeting and ruin the economy of oil producing nations?
285 2018-06-30 23:17:55 My 32oz of castor oil came... it’s the size of my foot. Mind you I’m a size 10 shoe.
286 2018-06-30 23:17:41 Even though I love seeing him but baby oil on lol

297 2018-06-30 23:15:55 There is no turmoil and dysfunction in Iran.  The only issue is that Trump and America has tried to ruin the denuclearisation agreement and as a result there is less oil in the market.  
As other inept Trump decision.

315 2018-06-30 23:14:10 1) Study "greenhouse effect"
2) CO2 is a green house gas
3) For millions of years, plants soaked up CO2, died, turned into oil.
4) Levels of CO2 dropped, the earth cooled
5)Starting 1900 we dig up plants (oil), burn to release carbon again

What do you think happens next?

336 2018-06-30 23:12:21 BREAKING: This morning the President tweeted that he had convinced Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production up to 2 million barrels.  Doing so would break OPEC rules.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

346 2018-06-30 23:10:34 There's a reason why God didn't give oil to those in the Northern part of this Vampire Country

351 2018-06-30 23:10:02 I wonder how much of his parties campaign donations came from the oil and gas sector...?
352 2018-06-30 23:09:44 The truth is governments subsidize oil because it returns their money in spades in terms of overall benefit to the economy (all of which requires fuel to work). The subsidy narrative misses the bigger picture. 

Fossil fuels make *piles* of money. Their costs are climate related.
353 2018-06-30 23:09:36 @CNN Is it within a President's Mandate to be asking the leader of #SaudiArabia to increase production and reduce the price of oil . Is this any different from the Currency Manipulation @POTUS accuses #China of taking part in ? @BBCWorld @MSNBC @nytimes @washingtonpost

378 2018-06-30 23:06:11 Nice.  @POTUS thanks for making us more dependent on Saudi oil.  Awesome power move.   When #Obama was president oil prices dropped and stabilized.  Alternative sources were pursued and the oil producing nations felt the pain.  Now you are begging.   #ArtOfTheDeal

383 2018-06-30 23:05:34 How do you figure that? The Enbridge upgrades and line 9 reversal virtually eliminated the light oil differential.  

We had 1.2mm bbls of added pipeline capacity under the CPC before the NDP came in to power.  And zero since, though TMX and line 3 are close.

That dries out some hair types. It’s all trial and error. When I had curls I made a Shea butter whip, can’t now
395 2018-06-30 23:04:39 Vital to get framing right: the problem here is that the rich people of this world (you and me) who have benefitted from centuries of deforestation and coal/oil burning aren't PAYING to compensate the rest for saving what remains of the planet

403 2018-06-30 23:03:24 He started agricultural programs that would be able to feed his people. But by raising Oil Prices and growing their own food he enraged the US and Europe so they started to undermine is country by stopping food imports and cutting oil production.

I don't like playing this part, but someone might want to, should anyone wind up in court in a defensive firearms case. Better to act proactively in these matters, I mean why do we can in the first place?
428 2018-06-30 23:00:06 got oil in my toes yeah yeah 
ain’t no soil by these hoes yeah
got these bones in my eyes yeah
don’t eat those cones full of pies yeah yeah
429 2018-06-30 23:00:05 When you have to bargain hunt, you need a brilliant coach. (See Bill Belichik). Do the #Oilers have a brilliant coach? I think not.
430 2018-06-30 23:00:02 Trump urges Saudis to raise oil output 'by two million barrels'. France surrenders.
431 2018-06-30 23:00:01 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
432 2018-06-30 22:59:56 Bad news sa mga motorista, oil price hike, asahan sa susunod na linggo #MaynilaItoAngPilipinas #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
433 2018-06-30 22:59:56 Instead of keeping your Air Wicks plugged in all the time, save money on air fresheners by just rubbing the scented oil on the inside of your nostrils.
434 2018-06-30 22:59:54 I am . Siya man mag cgeg texts. D ko pede maka chanemge ug number. Haasit
435 2018-06-30 22:59:52 Bet you’ll accept the cheaper oil prices though?
436 2018-06-30 22:59:50 Saudi Arabia already agreed to increase oil production in OPEC summit
437 2018-06-30 22:59:37 Dodd: "What do you think is the ideal way of life?"
Kerouac: "Hermit in the woods, one-room cabin, wood stove, oil lamp, books, food, outhouse, no electricity, just creek or brook water, sleep, hiking, nothing-to-do -- (Chinese Wu Wei)."
438 2018-06-30 22:59:25 actually, the fondue is just the first course, you actually do cook meat and veggies in a broth or oil. and then the next course is a big ole pot of chocolate  fuck am i craving melting pot right now??
439 2018-06-30 22:59:14 That could be true. I wonder if any of them know about Kratom or other things like CBD Oil? I am going to check it out.
440 2018-06-30 22:59:09 And Norway gets a ginormous amount of money from.......oil
441 2018-06-30 22:59:04 Battle of the ships.  bread and butter, starch and banga, milk and oil. In that order. 
442 2018-06-30 22:59:02 Thought I was being clever. Found an old bottle of geranium oil. Good for keeping mozzies away. Blitzed the room. Unfortunately it’s gone off. And stinks.  #heatwave
443 2018-06-30 22:58:44 BUT ITS TRUE. You deserve to hear the truth, hon. Your artwork is phenomenal and you should put your oil paintings out more. 
444 2018-06-30 22:58:43 @cooperjac Jim Bell will bring some motor oil down to Florida for the return tripp.
445 2018-06-30 22:58:40 That's A test. I'm looking forward to the part where someone burns themselves with increasing hot oil.
446 2018-06-30 22:58:35 Yayyyy!!! Oh my gosh yesterday I made zucchini and carrot noodles with sesame oil, tahini, soy sauce, and pepper flakes w/ green onions and avacado. This thing is amazing
447 2018-06-30 22:58:31 Yes! I have some wrapping foam with eucalyptus in it so I put that through my scalp,oil and wrapped a hot towel around my head I was so irritated 
448 2018-06-30 22:58:31 Dividend is a great way of thinking about UBI but the issue people still ask is where the money comes from. No matter what, there will be net payers and net receivers. In Alaska, the net payers are essentially the stockholders of oil companies.
449 2018-06-30 22:58:23 Is it an oil?
450 2018-06-30 22:58:13 Ko aku agak ragu ya kalo dipakein ke muka. Kalo buat komedo gt mending pake face oil atau minyak zaitun deh kayaknya
451 2018-06-30 22:57:57 Think the economists said that oil prices have peaked and will be coming down.  Trump probably read oops was told the same. So he will claim lower prices are bc of him.
452 2018-06-30 22:57:54 Trump making it look easy... ring up the prince; BOOM oil prices go down!  Easy when u actually put America FIRST!!
453 2018-06-30 22:57:47 Uhh, well it's true they stole the car, but they did change the oil, so it's only fair to let them keep it!
454 2018-06-30 22:57:45 How is the being of beholden to those who hold the purse strings of the buffoon in chief related to developing instability in the domestic oil markets?
455 2018-06-30 22:57:39 @realDonaldTrump we don't need BigPharma synthetic CBD oil so politicians can make profits off kids-we NEED natural CBD Oil USPatent6630507 #ReclassifyCBDOil Reclassify Marijuana out of Class1 #RepealNCVIA #NoForcedVaccines
456 2018-06-30 22:57:37 Absolutely right, we subsidize, fined for water use for these special interests Ranchers that destroy & take the land away from the Wildlife that belongs there & further is allowed to kill what’s left, these are our lands we need to get Welfarists Ranchers, oil, Mining out
457 2018-06-30 22:57:26 Washed & vacuumed my car, got my oil changed, & a full tank of gas . 
458 2018-06-30 22:57:21 Tea tree oil can help dry pimples... Hanap ka muna ng products na hiyang sa skin mo minsan kasi ung products mismo ang natulong sa pagdami..
459 2018-06-30 22:57:01 Good to hear, Lets make some moves to bolster oil and gas development and lower taxes a little and you might get my vote next election!
460 2018-06-30 22:56:52 Prices "too" high 
Or
"Prices to high"

The second one sounds like you are conspiring to set high oil prices with Saudi Arabia.

Just sayin....
461 2018-06-30 22:56:44 Thank you 
462 2018-06-30 22:56:39 There needs to be more of a push on renewable energy. Oil will only lead us further down the path of foreign reliance and unnecessary conflict.
463 2018-06-30 22:56:38 Could see spike up Sp500 futures on Monday, If IF If
A sharp sell off crude oil prices. ( actually, predicted crude oil would fall below $70)
464 2018-06-30 22:56:35 Please stop Louisiana has given up Billions in Oil &Gas royalties that Alaska gets to keep.
465 2018-06-30 22:56:29 America First....let’s buy more Saudi oil....
466 2018-06-30 22:56:01 I grease my scalp real good plus oil my shit my hair itch like crazy
467 2018-06-30 22:56:00 And there's me thinking the US was awash with oil thanks to the miracle of fracking LOL!
468 2018-06-30 22:55:56 If there was VAR in 1986, there would not have been a ‘Hand of God’ goal. There would have been a red card but no World Cup for AFA. So #Argentina please know that #Messi has delivered for you. Time and time again.
469 2018-06-30 22:55:53 Got some oil right now...
470 2018-06-30 22:55:49 just use tea tree essential oil and they stay away good for you and the environment :)
471 2018-06-30 22:55:41 Nooooo .... I WORK IN THE OIL FIELD ....
Well it could get back around  $65.00 and everyone will be happy.
People remember the first 50% $cost of a barrel of Oil goes to the landowners and the GOVERNMENT'S (state/fed)
Ex: $70 ÷ 2(50%) = $35.00 a barrel 
Then the cost to get it ..
472 2018-06-30 22:55:29 So I forgot my regular sunglasses at work so now here I am. Driving with clout goggles, an oil pen and The Carters Apeshit playing. The epitome of trash. #imselfaware
473 2018-06-30 22:55:22 We complain too much instead of doing something about it. Blame Harper and Paul Martin...they are willing to sell Canada to Russians and Americans. Our oil and no refinery. Very funny. Selling the 407 highway and doing who knows what with Niagara power plant. ..
474 2018-06-30 22:55:18 Is because the barrel of oil is heading to 10 dollars or less. Definitely is the best time to short oil companies.
475 2018-06-30 22:55:10 Oil production, April. (million barrels per day)

Russia: 11.35
Saudi Arabia: 9.92
Iraq: 4.41
Iran: 3.82
UAE: 2.87
Kuwait: 2.71
Nigeria: 1.59
Angola: 1.5
Venezuela: 1.42
Algeria: 0.99
Libya: 0.98
Qatar: 0.6
476 2018-06-30 22:55:09 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
477 2018-06-30 22:55:07 How far did the #Isles make it in the playoffs the season before? If u were to chose a team after the playoffs when the Oilers lost to the Ducks, who would you pick would go farther the year after? Isles of Oil? I would of taken the Oilers.... ooops
478 2018-06-30 22:54:35 Look up BLACK SEED OIL!  We all needa knw about things like this
479 2018-06-30 22:54:33 PM Abiy's policy towards the Somali pple is same as TPLF's old policy. How he rushed the crude oil fiasco before addressing the human rights crisis in the region is an exmple of that same old policy of 'the land is ours but not the people'. It speaks volumes @fitsumaregaa
480 2018-06-30 22:54:29 Of course my parents have olive oil bar soap.
481 2018-06-30 22:54:28 Yes.
Especially if they own pets.
Or if they have a garage.
...
I smell like cigarettes and engine oil, quite a lot.
482 2018-06-30 22:54:14 Nah but fr... how they extract Baby Oil from babies?
483 2018-06-30 22:54:05 it is a good start but I cant see the yanks handing over that oil rich territory in the north east
484 2018-06-30 22:53:58 Not if oil drops too low + China trade tensions. All on heels of Russia meeting.
485 2018-06-30 22:53:50 Best idea ever @BelongsToHayden (laying the strips of bacon in the pan, I take the tongs from the draw. Taking a plate from the sink from last nights washing up, I put some paper towel down to soak up the oil so it doesn’t end up on my ass)
486 2018-06-30 22:53:42 Water is the new oil
487 2018-06-30 22:53:35 なるわけないだろ
488 2018-06-30 22:53:27 Hemp has no CBD in it. But has omega 3 and 6 that help for pain and anxiety in most people. I've been taking it for 2 years as oil and its helped a lot. Chia seed oil is twice as good though but way more money.
489 2018-06-30 22:53:26 I give my kids cannabis smoothies. We juice the leaves. My dad used cannabis to heal his cancer. And my 18 month old niece takes cannabis oil for her seizures.Cannabis is safer than Tylenol. Should be taken orally for best effects.
490 2018-06-30 22:53:13 Same foreline trap as on my system! Great traps, having the ability to change the trap material is very convenient, and provides bidirectional protection from oil backstreaming/absorbing water vapor (with the proper trap material.) I got 1lb of trap zeolite from LDS for only $25.
491 2018-06-30 22:53:04 He actually didn't pitch the end times back then...And Tammy was somehow mesmerising and sincere.  I say this as a lifelong liberal cynic. Started watching them for laughs and watched it all unfold. He's a snake oil man.  She was the real deal...tacky but real.
492 2018-06-30 22:53:02 About time... you are responsible for high oil prices,  to benefit your friends.  Now your friends can fix it.
493 2018-06-30 22:52:59 Another paid big oil commercial by ‘Friends O Science’.
494 2018-06-30 22:52:39 まゆだぬき ？
495 2018-06-30 22:52:39 あら…ガシャは運ですからね…
496 2018-06-30 22:52:32 You are AWESOME for trying to get the oil prices down.  We are behind you 100%.
497 2018-06-30 22:52:19 Why so greedy oil corporations can benefit? Oh wait, so you can benefit that's right. Because our president is nothing more than a mentally challenged businessman trying to make himself richer through the power of the government for his own corporate greed.
498 2018-06-30 22:51:55 They need to cut output, running up prices, so less oil will be wasted.
499 2018-06-30 22:51:52 Those 2 are like oil and water.
500 2018-06-30 22:51:50 Vast wealth stolen from Scotland.......that will be what, the RBS bailout ?, the £10bn annual fiscal transfer ?, the 4000 jobs at Faslane, the naval shipyard jobs - please don't say the oil tax revenue or you get the dunces cap
501 2018-06-30 22:51:49 Lots of grease and oil I suppose
502 2018-06-30 22:51:32 Trump breaks the Iran deal then asks the Saudis to increase oil production. This is going to raise prices and possibly nullify the OPEC pact. This is a windfall for Saudis and Russia. 2 key countries he conspired with.
503 2018-06-30 22:51:23 I put grape-scenting engine oil in the Weed-Eater (2-stroke). Don't @ me !
504 2018-06-30 22:51:16 I was low on olive oil so a trip to the store was stiill required.
505 2018-06-30 22:51:01 Not in the oil patch. If you are a warm body you will get hired. Walmart starts at 13 and that goes for fast food places and retail. A couple of yrs ago Best Buy was starting out at 12.50. Oil field is paying big bucks
506 2018-06-30 22:51:01 That is the answer right there. Let China buy TMX. Then the oil it pumps to tankers off coast of BC will be foreign.

Everyone knows foreign oil tankers off our coasts are safe. Nobody ever protests them. 

Then China can make billions and piss off Albertans.
507 2018-06-30 22:50:59 Great, there goes my oil stocks.  Sell off American shale oil producers
508 2018-06-30 22:50:58 Mitch McConnell said they might get to the Supreme Court nomination proceedings by early fall. Two months or more to get it started? No wonder it takes forever to get anything done in Congress. Trump makes a five minute phone call and gets the price of oil down.
509 2018-06-30 22:50:44 Inadmissible
510 2018-06-30 22:50:34 Plus deregulation leads to the preadatory practices that tanked our economy in 2008. Deregulation lets coal and oil companies to pollute our drinking water. There is a reason Nixon started the EPA. It was necessary.
511 2018-06-30 22:50:23 So did you actually read Spicey's book to be able to avow "Really good, go get it!", or are you lying for him like he used to lie for you? Once a snake oil salesman, always a snake oil salesman. #LiarInChief #DidYouThinkAmericansAreThatStupid?
512 2018-06-30 22:50:22 I hate when I see people not putting on sunscreen and putting on fucking tanning oil instead but it’s none of my business I guess
513 2018-06-30 22:50:15 Grab the oil shit fire
514 2018-06-30 22:50:01 I really don’t believe you. Do you think a King would listen to you? Oil production increase was announced on Wednesday morning, heard it in the car on my way to work.
515 2018-06-30 22:49:45 Watermelon, tofu, chili oil, kombu, sea salt.  Ivan ramen
516 2018-06-30 22:49:24 Stop beating Oil King. Let Oil King win everything.
517 2018-06-30 22:49:12 Why does Saudi Arabia get away with being murderers and thieves? 
Because Oil?
518 2018-06-30 22:49:08 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
519 2018-06-30 22:49:07 Asparagus + Olive Oil + Salt + Grill = Happiness
520 2018-06-30 22:49:03 I feel like I'm that olive oil "extra virgin"
521 2018-06-30 22:49:02 What’s this mean for US Oil & Gas operations? Do you think the current economic uptick is contributed by the increase in Oil & Gas exploration and production?
522 2018-06-30 22:48:44 The reimagining of ICE by the left is an agency that provides safe passage of illegals into interior. They have said so.
523 2018-06-30 22:48:30 Hmm. I wonder if this will have any impact on the price of oil?
524 2018-06-30 22:48:23 July na. Birthmonth ko na. Cguru mao ni ang pina ka sad na birthday nako. Haist.
525 2018-06-30 22:48:11 We tear up the deal Iran, as a result gas prices soar, we once again rely on Saudi oil. The art of the deal? For who?
526 2018-06-30 22:48:10 Our hillbilly mouse proof food storage is working! Not a single mouse in a month! Pallets mounted 22 inches off the ground on pillars of wood and block covered in metal flashing and soaked in motor oil!
527 2018-06-30 22:47:56 Liar.  He doesn’t control the release of oil.  It’s OPEC and they had already announced they were going to release more oil.  You have nothing to do with it.
528 2018-06-30 22:47:49 hi has anyone’s nose piercing been infected i’ve tried everything, tea tree oil, saline water, antiseptic cream but nothing’s working n it’s just getting worse LOL someone help a girl out xx
529 2018-06-30 22:47:35 An Outlined plate 16 from the portfolio
Michael Ponce De León
Oil pigment, vinyl edge binding, and pencil
530 2018-06-30 22:47:24 My legs ache with nobody to rub me with oil sigh
531 2018-06-30 22:47:05 Atleast bai. Gimibgaw lang. Never kong nireply sa iyang messages last nyt.
532 2018-06-30 22:46:56 Still Psalm 23
Psalm of  "King David".

"Thou' anointest my head with oil. My cup runnetth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord, forever".
533 2018-06-30 22:46:53 How do I have oil on my scrubs and I just put them on an hour ago 
534 2018-06-30 22:46:38 Its everywhere. Get peppermint & tea tree oils; use in spray bottles w/warm water & dish soap. Use it all over. NEEM oils w/coconut or vaseline, rub & leave on. Wash hair w/apple cider ving; Wash/shower w/Pepp oil. Stop breads grains wheat GMOs rocessed. We're all infected.
535 2018-06-30 22:46:34 not sure if real.... someone posted the transcript of phone convo. and no talk of oil outputs....trying to find it again
536 2018-06-30 22:45:52 OPEC crude oil price (1998): $12.28 U.S. dollars per barrel
OPEC crude oil price (2018): $67.33 U.S. dollars per barrel
@OPECSecretariat @realDonaldTrump 
Is da price of crude oil going 2 go down to 1998 level during da @BillClinton administration? @realDonaldTrump @RalphNader 42
537 2018-06-30 22:45:43 @CNNMoney Oil price increases is total BULLSHIT !!!!!!
538 2018-06-30 22:45:33 Didn't you say over and over again that you do not want to import anything. Shouldn't you raised the tariff on the import of oil.
539 2018-06-30 22:45:18 If people with COW can be this 'powerful' what if they had CRUDE OIL?? 
JUST THINKING 
540 2018-06-30 22:45:17 What part of "Largest Proven Oil Reserves in the World" is causing confusion for you? Ever hear of "Desert Storm"? "Operation Iraqi Liberation"?, Wow, the letters for that 2nd one spell "OIL". False reasons for those wars. Kermit Roosevelt and Iran, Google it.
541 2018-06-30 22:45:09 How about stop empowering and doing business with oil dictatorships which steal the life chances of an entire country: such as Equatorial Guinea 
542 2018-06-30 22:45:05 If you struggle with #insomnia or have trouble #sleeping soundly through the night...magnesium oil is a safe way to promote restful #sleep.
543 2018-06-30 22:44:50 Thank you for helping the poor by keeping oil prices down. 
544 2018-06-30 22:44:26 I'm a popsicle on a hot griddle soaked in boiling oil.
545 2018-06-30 22:44:22 i like sauces that make you sweat b/c very spicy... the sauce i make most often for udon noodles is:

* peanut butter
* 2 eggs
* hot sesame oil
* soy sauce
* filipino fish sauce
* carmelized green onions
* baby spinach
* beef broth
* sriracha
* 4-5 diced fresh thai chilis
546 2018-06-30 22:44:20 probably wid be if there was no poppy farming for the West , nor oil or pipeline.
547 2018-06-30 22:44:19 lavender oil!!
548 2018-06-30 22:44:11 We don't need mining or oil and gas drilling in Alaska, either. We need to move away from it all and keep Alaska's resources from getting destroyed by those wanting only profit. We need to move to a more renewable energy fast before someone destroys our beautiful state.
549 2018-06-30 22:44:03 Nobody on the left can say what an acceptable number is for the Maras and not the only gang of illegals operating. Drug cartels are well established as well.
550 2018-06-30 22:44:00 Ebi you oil dey your skin fine 
551 2018-06-30 22:43:54 It won't be a bad idea if federal government can declare state of emergency on these sectors: Education, Health, Security, Transportation, Economy, Power, Works, Housing, ICT, Tourism, Civil Service Commission, Oil & Gas, Agriculture. 

These sectors are existing on life support!
552 2018-06-30 22:43:51 Looking forward to seeing you rip around Grandview speedway Tuesday night
553 2018-06-30 22:43:43 Maybe 30% to 40% Canadian oil rebranded to be USA oil. Good deal - Buy it at 40% discount & sell it at full market price.
554 2018-06-30 22:43:36 Today I was talking about how I have truffle oil and my moms boyfriend looks at me and goes you have truffle butter? I’m at the age where they no longer have a filter around me. NOOOO
555 2018-06-30 22:42:59 Bros, you sha like to hype yer self o. That Egusi still need oil, salt and ogiri.
556 2018-06-30 22:42:56 Dropping the bucket down the well for water, and ending up with oil
557 2018-06-30 22:42:46 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
558 2018-06-30 22:42:44 OH .. so the Saudis are so rich .. they evenh ad enough pocket change to finance the 9/11 atrocities .. yet we're going to continue purchasing oil from them? I could'a sworn I'd hear that the US was producing enough of our own oil to now be self sufficient when it comes to that!
559 2018-06-30 22:42:32 The oat lotion sounds excellent...not as greasy as coconut oil, which has its drawbacks I realize. Glad you weren’t more seriously injured, but I’m sure you’re very sore 
560 2018-06-30 22:42:32 Camilla is gonna fight you! But easy solution to handle the competition... Just heat up some oil in the fryer.
561 2018-06-30 22:42:30 My B in law Designs & builds the Oil rigs..he is YES too..and English! ;)
562 2018-06-30 22:42:04 Learn or do gulma
563 2018-06-30 22:41:57 About the firewood or the oil used to fry the akara?
564 2018-06-30 22:41:35 Women are scum,so this girl blocked me from viewing her status,because I use to caution her on the way she dress ,and preach to her,just because I CNT shout wowww woww like ambulance
565 2018-06-30 22:41:34 What about Texas and Louisiana oil workers. They voted for you.
566 2018-06-30 22:41:27 Yes I work with grease and oil for a living and no I'm not going to spend 2 hours everyday after work scrubbing the fuck outta my skin just to make you feel better when you see me. Take it or leave it.
567 2018-06-30 22:41:21 Still have a video of me and @d00mbl4de struggling to cook in Switzerland (maybe Germany?) with the lack of oil so we resorted to using water. A good time
568 2018-06-30 22:41:12 got some peppermint oil in my eye,, will I ever be able to open it again yes or no @WebMD
569 2018-06-30 22:41:04 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed! لماعرف
570 2018-06-30 22:41:02 And so little democracy...
And democracy these days is inversely proportional to Your countries oil reserves.
Unless You have nuclear weapons.

572 2018-06-30 22:40:51 From the wsj. "A senior Saudi official said the kingdom has made no specific promise to President Trump but rather assured the U.S. of its capability to meet oil demand."
573 2018-06-30 22:40:45 This looks like it could be an old oil painting !
574 2018-06-30 22:40:42 Did my first service on my motorcycle. Amsoil in all three holes, new oil filter (without getting oil everywhere), new air filter, and new plugs.

Feeling pretty good. Enjoyed it and saved some money.

583 2018-06-30 22:39:47 They usually smell of dirt and oil, and their breath is so bad it's toxic to humans. Know matter how cute your car is don't let it jump up on you or sleep on you, it becomes an annoying habit that could land you in the ER.

Biden's son sits on the board of an oil company in Nazified Ukraine.
Freedom House was started by Reagan's CIA director Bill Casey. It's a CIA front.

Quite a selection of democracy advocates...

601 2018-06-30 22:34:42 If this is the case.. July Oil will close between 62-65 at least this range appear to be the equilibrium range if supply is going to increase
602 2018-06-30 22:34:36 First remove makeup w a vegan/fragrance free makeup wipe, rub coconut oil on face (idc what ppl say abt it not being a face wash, it’s a face wash in my book), pat it down w warm washcloth, let it sit, spray rose water, let that sit, dry it a bit, vitamin e oil to moisturize
603 2018-06-30 22:34:34 No, but i mix mine with some Coconut/Shea butter oil since I have extremely dry skin. It’s  helped my blending come out way better.
604 2018-06-30 22:34:16 2 things GOI should consider before 2019 elections:

606 2018-06-30 22:34:13 if venezuela was really socialism you'd be complaining about your fair share of the oil revenue over steak dinner. maybe the problem is having criminals for politicians
607 2018-06-30 22:34:03 Good Saturday, your President has uttered, so far, just a couple of outright, provable lies.This one and the whopper he told about the Saudi’s agreeing to increase oil production on his say so... people domestically and abroad are finally starting to call out his ridiculous lies.
608 2018-06-30 22:34:01 Going organic with your skincare? Try clove oil on pimples. Dries them right up.
609 2018-06-30 22:33:25 Reduce your stress! Dab essential oil (like lavender) onto your pulse points (wrists and behind your ears) to help you stay calm
610 2018-06-30 22:33:13 Art friends: any recommendations on a mid-price range set of oil paints? I don’t want to break the bank but also want decent quality while I learn
611 2018-06-30 22:32:57 Trump's economy isn't as great as he he thinks it is--& that's according to conservative fund managers on Wall street. Tariffs will weaken it further, as will increases in oil prices.
612 2018-06-30 22:32:47 The oil sands are the most environmentally responsible oil in the world! Trudeau's Globalist agenda is spelled out in the UN agenda 21.That is why he treats cdn oil as he does.he is fulfilling the globalist agenda !!!

614 2018-06-30 22:32:10 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

616 2018-06-30 22:31:00 Use almond or coconut oil every day. Using almond or coconut oil every day will moisturize your skin, help you tighten loose skin and get rid of stretch marks. Rub a little bit of oil along your belly and thighs before bed.
617 2018-06-30 22:30:57 And yet Russia and Saudi Arabia plan to increase crude production,  have anything to do with oil companies shuttering production facilities
618 2018-06-30 22:30:41 Doug, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil/Gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Selling Canada’s Gay friendly oil saves lives of #LGBTQ @PrideToronto @GayTorontoEvent

620 2018-06-30 22:30:28 Ya. @JustinTrudeau doesnt realize @realDonaldTrump can shut his little pipeline down as quick as he opened it. Careful, little one. Rince and repeat..... America will close your dirty oil pipeline down faster than you gave a terrorist millions......

626 2018-06-30 22:29:54 Saudi kingdom is the key country to balance the oil prices as well as the only country assist and help others. It is peace country love peace. May God bless king Salaman and his crown prince Mohamed and bestow all saudis with his blessings. #ولي_العهد_محمد_بن_سلمان

they might not go extinict, but olive oil is going to get mighty expensive

634 2018-06-30 22:28:29 All depressing with Trump trying to force Grid operators to use coal instead of  cheaper green energy and Heathrow expansion - and both Arctic and Antarctica melting to oblivion - Trudeau spending billions on pipeline - Big Oil still rules when it should be consigned to history
635 2018-06-30 22:28:06 Why do we need to buy oil when we have plenty of our own?

640 2018-06-30 22:26:47 U use non oil based soap. Oils do nothing but spread the pepper extract around. Thats why u dont drink milk when eating peppers it spreads the oils around

A simple phone call and Trump adds $billions to the US Economy 

It has a double-whammy, KSA also puts more pressure on Iran too by lowering oil prices
649 2018-06-30 22:25:30 @BBCWorld what happened to the JCB electric Excavator? Bp is dismantling the North Sea oil, no news.

651 2018-06-30 22:25:29 Trump supporters and clever is like oil and water.
652 2018-06-30 22:25:29 The oil price will go up,  The straits will be bombed and shipping stopped, and it will start a fight that would tank the dollar as it is on it's last legs and Trump would fail as he never thought he would in his nightmares

657 2018-06-30 22:24:52 The prices are too high. Why don't you release some of the reserves. Let's make a deal you can do all of your racist shit. If you keep oil prices at $35 a barrel.
658 2018-06-30 22:24:51 There is no more turmoil and DYSFUNCTION in Iran and Venezuela than there was in January 2017. There is, however, more turmoil and dysfunction in America due to your wreckless policies. That is what is causing oil prices to rise.

667 2018-06-30 22:23:00 Liar.  He doesn’t control the release of oil.  It’s OPEC and they had already announced they were going to release more oil.  You have nothing to do with it.
668 2018-06-30 22:22:57 Is that you?
669 2018-06-30 22:22:56 In this case "I'm not wrong and all these people keep arguing against me, or the straw man they've built of me, anyways"
Not my fault if the logic can't be seen, it's dead simple.  One wording could lead to negative results, the other won't.  Simple as that.
670 2018-06-30 22:22:51 So to add to this picture of higher tariffs/retaliation/oil- lower demand for US exports by key trading partners translate into stagflation, low real US rates, still high/wider trade deficit. Add some selling of US bonds holding by central banks and the pic for weak $ is complete

690 2018-06-30 22:20:00 Mary, I don’t remember anyone complaining about oil prices when it hit over $4 a gallon, some places $5, when Obama was president. It is amazing what the left can find to complain about under Donald Trump. The difference is that Trump can fix the problem, but Obama couldn’t.
691 2018-06-30 22:19:54 Well, many countries actually asked for increases, including China.  OPEC won’t do anything based on what DJT alone says.  It is true he asked the Saudis.  It is also true they previously asked to decrease output to keep oil propped up  and imposed sanctions on Iran limiting o/p.

703 2018-06-30 22:18:43 I agree regarding the international community, but not on Libyans. Distribution of oil revenue and militia oppression are topmost concerns for Libyans. While his move does not fully address it, I anticipate it is tactical and the strategic plan behind it will be revealed.
704 2018-06-30 22:18:43 Oil industries are preserving the profit they have left in oil while acknowledging that renewables are inevitable. They funded opposition research to make oil competitive (even with subsidies) in the emergence of renewables.
705 2018-06-30 22:18:41 The venue has an underlying smell of engine oil...
706 2018-06-30 22:18:38 Use to drink castor oil when younger...not the best thing in the world!! Worse than marmite!! 
707 2018-06-30 22:18:34 Oh Uganda May God........... Now all social medias have been blocked, Tax Tax everywhere, Tax on cooking oil (VAT&Direct), Four Taxes on Mobile Money Transactions! What's really wrong with our Country?! and now Social Media Tax!! So embarrassing making us hate our dear country!!!
708 2018-06-30 22:18:34 Their 7oz steak sheathed in harp oil (for the strings) slid into their love taco
709 2018-06-30 22:18:33 You mean blatant lie by trump because his followers don't understand the oil market
710 2018-06-30 22:18:24 Bathers & baby oil. Me going to the beach 25 yrs ago.
Me aged 45: deck chairs, wind breaker, water, baseball cap, factor 20, umbrella, kindle, spf lip balm!! #nohashtagsuitable
711 2018-06-30 22:18:11 So, from start to finish I was at Valvoline for and hour and 23 minutes.  
I got my oil changed for $10.96
712 2018-06-30 22:18:08 A real fix is to stop using our land-$ to subsidize oil & instead use our $-resources to build out automated production of solar-wind-batteries so that we don't need oil to begin with, this is a win-economically/win-environmentally/win-for the word humanity.
713 2018-06-30 22:17:57 I am using a lot of QoL mods that fixes small annoyances I have with the game, auto applying oil,quest markers on the map, better icons on potions and oils and jumping in shallow water. Nothing big but things that made my experience much more enjoyable
714 2018-06-30 22:17:32 Orrrr an “I can’t be wrong so I’ll argue the most ridiculous point in order to try and win” kind of guy. If all you’re trying to do is win minds, you absolutely suck at it.

717 2018-06-30 22:16:49 Oy there is zero maintenance. Tires. That's it. Brakes don't even wear out due to regenerative. No oil changes, nothing.
718 2018-06-30 22:16:38 "How do you do it, roots in the soil untangled 
Releasing in sweet summer oil still I recoil like mace 
In all the little moments I pushed you away that I can't erase 
Cause every moment overflows with power 66 thousand miles an hour" #PostASongLyricYouLove
719 2018-06-30 22:16:32 is oil wet?
720 2018-06-30 22:15:40 And who payed for this article? Certainly not oil companies.
721 2018-06-30 22:15:40 Im so poor right now that i cant afford to get my oil changed which means i cant drive my car but it doesnt matter anyway bcuz im too poor right now to even leave the house to do anything

723 2018-06-30 22:15:35 I'm from America and your oil is too expensive.  Don't worry we have ours.
724 2018-06-30 22:15:34 Jojoba oil
725 2018-06-30 22:15:34 Your boss in Moscow won't be happy---he wants to keep oil prices high. You didn't clear this with him, I suppose.
726 2018-06-30 22:15:21 Yes, like their extreme anti-immigrant stance and their refusal to take their share of refugees. Granted, it works in Norway because they invested their oil money very wisely. As long as no one else comes in. Greece, Italy, Spain...not so much
727 2018-06-30 22:15:15 I did include olive oil and lime juice. Cumin next time?
728 2018-06-30 22:14:43 And most of these things were accomplished in spite of Obama. He fought oil and gas production, he fought tax cuts, no child left behind replaced with a worse system. Really don’t see any of HIS promises fulfilled. He gave us Obamacare, worse healthcare ever, at highest cost.
729 2018-06-30 22:14:39 I didn’t sleep last night went to moms today and changed my oil and replaced my spark plugs, then trimmed shrubs at my grandmas and then went swimming. Now I’m spinning poi by the pool waiting on my Italian food. I’m going to sleep so well tonight
730 2018-06-30 22:14:23 @GreenpeaceUK @ChrisGPackham @wwf_uk @mcsuk @CITES In a week where news has come through on tiger poaching, Japanese whaling and now virunga open for oil drilling, how do you remain so optimistic?
731 2018-06-30 22:14:09 Traditional hot dogs are made from a mix of pork, beef, and chicken. This bladder will act as the inner part of a mold. Then they add either canola or sunflower oil.
732 2018-06-30 22:14:06  hmm I’ve tried monoi and olive oil haha both work. I prefer monoi though, smells better than olive oil..
733 2018-06-30 22:13:48 Don't forget his payoff from Woodside Petroleum for screwing East Timor over the oil and gas treaty.
734 2018-06-30 22:13:45 More a "I'd rather otherwise legal owners and carriers to not wind up in serious legal trouble because of flippant remarks" kind of guy
735 2018-06-30 22:13:30 Can I put some oil on your boobs
736 2018-06-30 22:13:23 Let me guess you already bought your oil stocks and now waiting for it to go up
737 2018-06-30 22:13:19 This is what used to be called a travelling medicine show a 100 years ago. Any of you good people need snake oil or goat testicle implants? Doc Souza will fix you right up.

739 2018-06-30 22:13:12 I put coconut oil in my hair and my curls look so nice.
740 2018-06-30 22:13:07 Never short oil on a Friday .. lol
741 2018-06-30 22:12:58 Oil/gas/coal are keeping Ireland's economy going during heat wave as they did during last winter's severe weather. Intermittent wind power cannot guarantee ANY electricity.
742 2018-06-30 22:12:40 Anything that can pull your hair you should avoid & it can result in permanent hair loss. Wrap your hair up at night in a bonnet or silk scarf to protect those edges. Oil your; edges, scalp, and ends with coconut oil & macadamia oil. Deep condition & hot oil treatments 1 a wk
743 2018-06-30 22:12:36 FFP is a joke. The oil clubs (PSG, City, etc.) have been gaming the system for years. That's how they didn't violate "FFP" last year despite spending over a quarter billion on Neymar and a 130+ million promissory note.
744 2018-06-30 22:12:24 Maybe Trump asked Stuttering John to increase oil production, thinking he was the King of Saudi Arabia.
745 2018-06-30 22:12:18 Getting an oil change
746 2018-06-30 22:12:18 i know but like this one each veggie u cook separately lol but tbh i dont think you have too unless we put spinach cos that one u just blanch then mix with sesame oil and sou sauce
747 2018-06-30 22:12:12 Dozy dreamer. You know england can't cope without Cymru and Scotland. You have no water no oil and not enough energy. That is why we are not allowed to leave. And i agree it is funny as f**k. I'm not funny but England is a joke though.

751 2018-06-30 22:11:58 Tonight: homemade fried rice. sesame oil, pulled rotisserie chicken, peas, rice, egg. First: dog park.
752 2018-06-30 22:11:31 Covered in oil and squeezed together.
753 2018-06-30 22:11:26 The upsides to having severe sunburn are as follows.
1. Forced to find new solutions, almond oil #1.
2. Pain makes you sad so you go to bed early = more sleep.
3. You appreciate the fan a lot more than you used to.
4. More time to read because sitting at my desk is uncomfortable.
754 2018-06-30 22:11:11 And why is the same demand ask for when the country is benefiting from high oil revenue which is above $100 for at least 15years ,so made demands when the country as no money is not realistic 

 above $100pb
755 2018-06-30 22:10:45 Just like he suggested the Saudis are going to increase oil production by a huge amount (they aren't).  He humiliated Hope Hicks in a staff meeting. That's why she left. She's too smart to come back.

758 2018-06-30 22:10:00 Natty short rolled into an oil short...  Might recover from the killing in $EEM sooner than I thought
759 2018-06-30 22:09:59 Check out the stock market commodity exchanges and financial markets. Every up/down makes money. Example $10.00 in oil 1% rise is nothing. $10 million oil 1% rise is money. IF TRUMP cared he would be making friends abroad not destroying your old alliances lining family pockets.
760 2018-06-30 22:09:48 Isn’t #Oil price was very high during #Conservative rule? How come $13b debts? Must smoking weeds!
761 2018-06-30 22:09:47 And thousands  of layoffs in the oil patch direct result of LPC policies.  No bailout for them
762 2018-06-30 22:09:39 A little olive oil, lime juice and cumin maybe?
763 2018-06-30 22:09:27 I would be asking for a refund tbh. What do you have a masters in? So you are saying that the oil industry is making a fortune in renewables but are funding Scientists to disprove the climate fraud? Hmmm struggling to understand that logic. Who funds the climate alarmists?

765 2018-06-30 22:09:18 I need an oil change but nobody ever has my filter for my car 
766 2018-06-30 22:09:08 日曜朝から辛いっすね…
アイドルちゃんたち見て癒されましょ(これしか言えない)
767 2018-06-30 22:09:06 Ladies: if u plan on goin 2 the pool alot don’t 4get 2 give ur hair some extra TLC. Chlorine can be hard on ur locks, try using thicker conditioners /a good leave in conditioner if ur submerging alot. Also, let’s not 4get the power of a good hot oil treatment. Stay healthy 
768 2018-06-30 22:09:00 TV or oil induced edging?
769 2018-06-30 22:08:53 I couldn’t imagine having a man that doesn’t know how to change the oil or work on my car or fix stuff around the house. Or even hang stuff on the wall, even if it takes him 6 freaking months to finally do it.. Like I can do it too but I don’t wanna & it makes him feel important
770 2018-06-30 22:08:53 The real problem wasn't the driver, it was the mechanics. If they fitted a cone filter, polished intake kit and billet oil cap, they could have shaved 20 seconds off that time, easy.
771 2018-06-30 22:08:47 Using oil of lemon eucalyptus instead of DEET for mosquitoes:DA REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS TRYIN' TO DREAM UP ANOTHA PHUK'N HI-DOLLAR WAY TO STEAL FROM THE "REAL" AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS !!!!
772 2018-06-30 22:08:45 Yep.  The "wine about it" t-shirt is replaced by some obscure brewery they've been too. And the yuppie dog is a beard oil.
773 2018-06-30 22:08:42 Black Soap, Shea Butter, and Unrefined Coconut Oil has my face looking and feeling like a brand new massage chair.
774 2018-06-30 22:08:41 Our taxes don't run this economy believe me, oil does. If taxes did run the economy jobs will be created cause taxes have to be paid and citizens will be more involved in the electoral processes. Tithes run most part of churches and to what benefits?
775 2018-06-30 22:08:32 Er, what happened to America first? American oil? Are you going to add import tax to oil?
776 2018-06-30 22:08:10 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
777 2018-06-30 22:07:56 I put oil in my hair every week and also use a gooood moisturizer for my skin Bc hospitals suck the life from u lol
778 2018-06-30 22:07:55 I need a nice thorough body massage with coconut oil 
779 2018-06-30 22:07:43 Kate, my daughter, Kaisha, is driving around in a '53 plate Peugeot 306 in dark green! In the last week a new oil leak sprang up and her exhaust dropped off. As a full time carer for my wife I can't afford to help her out. Would love if your lad could help her out.
780 2018-06-30 22:07:40 Try castor oil and a good haircut !
781 2018-06-30 22:07:39 If you can make olive oil pancakes, DM please? I want to dedicate my life to you.
782 2018-06-30 22:07:25 If there is any lust involved it's Westminster's for Scotland's oil.
783 2018-06-30 22:06:59 Amazing imagery. 

Reminds me of the townspeople caught in the mass from the barbed-wire factory in David McCullough's "The Johnstown Flood" - they survived the flood, could not escape the prison of wire which rested against the bridge, the oil debris on the river caught fire...
784 2018-06-30 22:06:56 I wish someone would make a map of oil spills in canada too.
785 2018-06-30 22:06:55 Mix it w/ coconut oil & rub it over yourself... no mosquitoes will not come near you. If you have the herb, rub it directly on your skin :)
786 2018-06-30 22:06:42 Louisville ky has gouged us for 15 years over oil prices. They keep adding taxes to our gas here in Louisville mr. President I wish you would talk to our governor Matt Bevin and tell him to do something about it we have tried everything from calling to doing anything praying to
787 2018-06-30 22:06:36 The Libs have a will oil blue commissioning don’t they
788 2018-06-30 22:06:36 Got that oil change now I’m bouttah go act a fool on 3127
789 2018-06-30 22:06:34 Until American socialists after they get elected start wanting government to take over Oil Companies, Walmart, Amazon, Netflix, Att to ‘further the revolution’ Venezuela style I’m not concerned.
790 2018-06-30 22:06:27 Try local oil #Albertaoil #ethicaloil
791 2018-06-30 22:06:22 Gowdy is a grandstanding hawker at a sideshow while his buddies sell snake oil and have a crooked game of chance nearby.
792 2018-06-30 22:06:21 Why are we now more dependent on foreign oil?
793 2018-06-30 22:06:09 We use oilatum oil in bath for Nells too. Or cetraben cream too. Both are good.
794 2018-06-30 22:05:52 The oil field will be the death of me but I believe in reincarnation
795 2018-06-30 22:05:47 And it’s false. Men just have different jobs that women don’t do. I work I’m the oil and gas industry. I’ve seen women attempt to work in the field. Of the 100, only 1 lasted. The rest of the ladies work in an administration position. So the 70% on the dollar of a man, wrong.
796 2018-06-30 22:05:46 Looks like I need some 3in1 oil then
797 2018-06-30 22:05:23 Pipelines..oil fields..G7 in Toronto. A few that come to mind
798 2018-06-30 22:05:21 I accept that I'm just gonna beam like fresh grease and I carry my oil blotters. It's all I can do
799 2018-06-30 22:05:16 The sooner we develop a new source of energy to replace fossil fuels, or start investing on producing our own oil, the sooner we can stop kissing up to the Saudis.
800 2018-06-30 22:05:03 What songs do you sing in the shower? My usual mix is Midnight Oil’s Beds are Burning or Human League’s Louise.
801 2018-06-30 22:04:50 Do you have any rosemary oil or the plant?
802 2018-06-30 22:04:35 No need to question!
Objective: OIL
803 2018-06-30 22:04:31 Jamaican castor oil.

Iraq: 4.41
Iran: 3.82
UAE: 2.87
Kuwait: 2.71
805 2018-06-30 22:04:18 Yes I have read. I have a masters in this and working on PhD. Oil industry is heavily invested in renewables now because the markets are making oil obsolete. To stay relevant, they need to adapt.
806 2018-06-30 22:04:14 wore a split thigh floral dress today (groundbreaking), made palatable thanks to my friend coconut oil. two things of note happened:
1) at one point, felt strange treacle-like liquid between my thighs, checked & found a crushed fly?!!
2) sexy snakeskin sandals all day = blisters
807 2018-06-30 22:03:43 I will forever be appreciative of my daddy changing my oil and rotating my tires  #DaddysGirl
808 2018-06-30 22:03:37 Scotland - the only country in the world to discover oil, get poorer, then have their people convinced that oil is a curse.
809 2018-06-30 22:03:15 Después se enojan los chicos del pasquin barrial, poner una nota sobre el cierre de una fábrica sin la declaración de ningún actor de la negociación, es de mínima arriesgado e imprudente. Ya se comieron la curva con la militarización de OIL por no diferenciar una operación
810 2018-06-30 22:03:11 It would help if the GM knew how to do more than just make draft picks.......Good GM's do more......Hextall has done NOTHING to improve the current roster while Giroux and Voracek are still top players. Stop buying his bullshit. He's a snake oil salesman with no pressure to win
811 2018-06-30 22:03:02 Free agency(and the trade deadline) is already beyond absurd in Canada.
812 2018-06-30 22:02:44 Or threaten.n to release our oil reserves.gas should be about 200 a gallon or take it from iraq

814 2018-06-30 22:02:23 More copy & paste nonsense. Have you actually read what 97% agreed on? Do you not read that the oil industry is heavily invested in renewables?  You just parrot nonsense, without even reading up. Get back on Google and I’ll await something credible.
815 2018-06-30 22:02:05 30 hours on new generator and oil change done. next change at 50 hours
816 2018-06-30 22:02:02 Finally getting this oil change 
817 2018-06-30 22:01:44 #1 #POTUS et al #WH doesn’t control oil prices.                                              #2 USA has oil stored in USA, use it.        #3 #POTUS doesn’t control oil prices.
818 2018-06-30 22:01:16 Kaitlyn’s oil is slaying
819 2018-06-30 22:00:29 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
820 2018-06-30 22:00:18 Ready to drink castor oil and say fuck it
821 2018-06-30 22:00:15 Mark carney, most discredited gov of boe ever, not trustworthy as all brexit predictions were 180 degrees out. Oil, virtually worthless now, has shown a slight increase recently but not worth mentioning etc. Wish you the best of luck, think you’ll need it!
822 2018-06-30 22:00:06 COCONUT OIL CURES EVERYTHING. Litterally drench it and leave it in over night and then wash it out in the shower and shampoo just your roots so it doesn't look greasy! I do it once a week and it helps my dry hair so much!
823 2018-06-30 22:00:06 Use the oil flask on the door to the left of the drawer.
824 2018-06-30 22:00:04 Putin wants to pump more oil, guess what Trump wants now?
825 2018-06-30 22:00:00 Oil production, April. (million barrels per day)

826 2018-06-30 21:59:40 Yep. Like veganism; vegetarian, keto, etc - any diet can be done unhealthy. I choose to eat a very healthy vegetable heavy keto diet with lots of healthy fats like avocado and coconut oil. Others eat nothing but bacon and butter. Doesn’t mean “keto” is unhealthy. The person is.
827 2018-06-30 21:59:36 Yes, we know. This is all about oil.
828 2018-06-30 21:59:34 then all the white looking women coming for me keep bringing up shine and oil. lol weave not supposed to be oily baby.
829 2018-06-30 21:59:27 I read this as "no-hands source" clear as day, so I'm probably too mad to offer advice. Candles are good for meditating. Oil lamps or lanterns are warm.
830 2018-06-30 21:59:03 Today I just had an intense family argument about if America sent problem solvers like Alcapulco the same way they took over Iraq & the oil they won't have people fleeing into the United States. But they are scared to deal with cartels.
831 2018-06-30 21:58:25 No India export refined oil to many countries including big ones.
832 2018-06-30 21:58:22 Which word? The words he uses when he lies or the word he uses to abuse people or the word he uses to sell snake oil?
833 2018-06-30 21:58:14 I’m also here for that definition... 
834 2018-06-30 21:58:13 Stop meddling in our markets. What about all the domestic oil? We need higher prices
835 2018-06-30 21:57:47 Don’t put baby oil on your elbows when you have a habit of leaning on them.
836 2018-06-30 21:57:41 its an oil change but its too hot to go under a car now
837 2018-06-30 21:57:36 Yes sir,wai she wan become sojo
838 2018-06-30 21:57:26 Saudi Arabia has increased oil production for years and years... but the output has been a steady flat line. The oil is running out. Maybe you should look into other technologies? Perhaps, the fastest growing industry in the world? Maybe invest in that?
839 2018-06-30 21:57:17 Hydrogen fuel cell technology needs to move forward. I'm sure oil companies don't want that to happen.
840 2018-06-30 21:57:08 Never mind the oil, where are you hiding the babies, trumpsky?
841 2018-06-30 21:57:04 I have burnt so badly today legit red as a lobster, currently covered in coconut oil and aftersun
842 2018-06-30 21:56:31 Well @GreenKeithMEP how do you justify this massive waste of police time and money on a conventional oil play? Not on my doorstep bollox?!
843 2018-06-30 21:55:34 Y’all should’ve seen this one customer who literally tasted and smelled her motor oil just to figure out what type it was. Fucking people today man.
844 2018-06-30 21:55:29 Sin oil no yegas to get the drinks 
845 2018-06-30 21:55:19 For the love  of blood oil money Yinon plan and New World Order.
846 2018-06-30 21:55:09 Hello Steve Stockman my name is Michele Brown and I am and beret thinking and I like to offer you and business proposal since you are in the Oil Business I struck Oil and want to sell to the highest talk now if I was you I take my talk serious I can be michelebrown655@gmail.com
847 2018-06-30 21:55:00 the secret is olive oil and salt
848 2018-06-30 21:54:56 Exactly!
849 2018-06-30 21:54:54 Maybe instead of lunch l should buy you anointing oil.
850 2018-06-30 21:54:51 haha  I need that country strength throw my ass over a shoulder after he work my land and change my oil.
851 2018-06-30 21:54:45 Liams back is so patchy he'll never again leave me put oil on him 
852 2018-06-30 21:54:42 Weird question that I hope someone can help me with: I have a canary, and bought odorless mineral spirits for thinning out my oil paint. He should be fine, right? Or will I have to move him?
853 2018-06-30 21:54:21 i put the tea tree oil chapstick in the dryer. it’s over my mom won’t buy me anymore
854 2018-06-30 21:54:17 Oil change duh 
855 2018-06-30 21:54:08 These people are not Republicans. They're Oil  People with a splash of the Russian Mob. Not a political party. Most certainly there's a Hub of People that have terrible Dirt Secrets on them all. And the Trumpians are desperate to keep the Dirt Secret. Just throw'n it out there.
856 2018-06-30 21:53:41 Treating myself to an oil change and new air filters, the guy at valvoline told me I “deserve it” and ya know what?? I DO
857 2018-06-30 21:53:27 It needs to be on radio not on the internet. Internet penetration is terribly low in this country. The people who will sell their vote for shiny 500 Naira and a bottle of oil don't have data to be listening to your podcast.
858 2018-06-30 21:53:19 Wasting our money on oil exploration.
859 2018-06-30 21:53:15 Well, they DO have oil..
860 2018-06-30 21:53:07 Oil prices low does not mean problems for US. Putin isn’t going to stay in power forever & low oil prices will hit Russian domestic politics hard! Positive for US.
861 2018-06-30 21:53:07 Olive oil works
862 2018-06-30 21:53:06 Marseille monaco Lyon Bordeaux Lille are all big clubs your saying there’s no competition but how can there be when psg has oil money and can pay 250 million for one player
863 2018-06-30 21:52:48 not centrally no as oil price fluctuates. But we would still rake in billions regardless.
864 2018-06-30 21:52:33 Vitamine E oil and massage helped mine, they should fade down quite a bit. Laser also helps
865 2018-06-30 21:52:20 Ill did my snowballs in oil and throw them at you while im skiing down a hill. Get out of my country fascist. Don't you dare step inside our borders again.

Pew pew.
866 2018-06-30 21:52:06 oo sa watson...pro usually blend ko sa oil..lol
867 2018-06-30 21:51:49 Trump lied again. This time about Saudi oil production. Does he ever tell the truth about anything?
868 2018-06-30 21:51:36 the system is more corrupted than ever, the proxy war in the middle east is too costly the oil money belongs to Iranian is not for you to waste, the Russian is not in our side working with the USA on the side, selling us arms and making us pay.
869 2018-06-30 21:51:13 Good. Let other oil suppliers destroy their ecosystems and crash after their reserves dry up. Canada should be planning for the future, not going out with the dinosaurs.
870 2018-06-30 21:51:08 Me and lisa forgot pillows, tin opener, blanket... our response "fuck it we will buy some more" 

The couple (over 50 years old) pitched up next to us have been arguing for a solid 20 minutes because one of them forgot cooking oil..

Fucksake. Just chill!!
871 2018-06-30 21:51:06 One thing i would hate is for ANYONE to put the wrong oil and mess my shit up hahahaha
872 2018-06-30 21:51:05 Someone on here once made a video mixing their highlighter into baby oil and it was the best thing I’ve ever seen. Been using this trick the whole summer. I been looking so glossy.
873 2018-06-30 21:51:00 best part about getting the oil changed in the car? Petting the friendly shop cat
874 2018-06-30 21:50:51 Hmm. Prices still rising though because of Iran Oil coming off the market. I Hope this counters that. What ever happened to us being energy independent? Oh wait we are, we just export it all now. Look into that Mr. President. (:
875 2018-06-30 21:50:24 It’s a method for faster hair growth ... basically you massage you hair with an oil ( coconut , jojoba, Black castor etc ) and then you lay upside down so that your head/hair is hanging and you massage your scalp for 5-7 mins everyday
876 2018-06-30 21:50:16 In another place and time, Perez would be disemboweled or drawn and quartered for that remark.
877 2018-06-30 21:50:16 hmm yeah bob seems to have a system with his liquid hwhite so I think he uses mostly pure paint, but it would be good to use turpentine or some oil to dilute it a bit, otherwise you're doing good for a first painting, keep at it if you want results!
878 2018-06-30 21:50:11 Oh they use oil in food as well. 1 liter is US$300.
879 2018-06-30 21:50:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
880 2018-06-30 21:50:03 I legit just want my oil changed and to not have to stand here all day and wait.. 
881 2018-06-30 21:50:00 RETWEET if you support oil and gas and American energy security!
882 2018-06-30 21:49:59 Coconut oil 
883 2018-06-30 21:49:38 Exactly. You have enough oil for yourself and no one else deserves any.
884 2018-06-30 21:49:36 They are just fine when it comes to $. Considering, the ownership has been creating a "war chest" for many years. Originally was to fund championship caliber teams in Westbrook & KD's prime. Obviously that changed. Large amounts of oil $ behind them, they are fine.
885 2018-06-30 21:49:20 Steyer is an Oil billionaire. These fascistic leftwingers are all 2-faced Hypocrites
AlGore made his money from oil and tobacco
886 2018-06-30 21:49:15 @Uchybaba your relationship need an engine oil. Don't date yourself
887 2018-06-30 21:49:14 While I appreciate the #grammarpolice, let’s focus on the fact that it’s Trump cronies profiting from this while suppressing new technologies that aren’t oil dependent.
888 2018-06-30 21:49:12 Me: I need to tan
*puts on sun tan oil
*sits in shade
889 2018-06-30 21:49:11 80% of my guys were shocked wen I told em wavy is a she
890 2018-06-30 21:49:06 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
891 2018-06-30 21:48:59 Boohoo is really bad for the environment, as is all fast fashion, and people should really take sustainable fashion seriously since the fashion industry is number two pollutant in the world, right behind the oil industry.
892 2018-06-30 21:48:46 i’m losing weight time to go home and drink olive oil
893 2018-06-30 21:48:34 They eat Argan fruit, poop it out and then the nut is easier to crack to extract the oil to use it in cosmetics. Tough shit.
894 2018-06-30 21:48:22 I'm from AC and saw it for myself day in and day out. Snake oil salesman.
895 2018-06-30 21:48:16 Haven't been really active on twitter though mostly minding my own business, but compared to trading oil and fx trading crypto is a walk in the park.
896 2018-06-30 21:47:48 just heard a lady complaining that the coconut oil she bought wasn’t making her cats skin any less dry no matter how much she put on it. 

lady you feed them the oil.....you’ve just been greasing up your cat for the past week.
897 2018-06-30 21:47:47 Wait, what happened? Before President Obama left, there was a "glut" and we were exporting OIL, now we gotta beg Saudi Arabia again?? #RADA Reclaim America's Democracy Again #RADA
898 2018-06-30 21:47:44 Remedy available, CBD oil, evening primrose tablets, rubbing essential oils onto my stomach. I tried all these before I was diagnosed because not a single dr in 10 years took me seriously, I was diagnosed December 17 and I still suffer, I still need pain relief and I dread (3)
899 2018-06-30 21:47:41 His patron in Moscow wants oil prices to be high. Trump's blabbery is just gaslighting.
900 2018-06-30 21:47:27 おはごです！
901 2018-06-30 21:47:06 Or pat it..do you want cream on? do u want try get another bath with some oil, see if that help..the cream was a choice..i was learned early to understand my own skin..that cream helps, sometimes it doesn't, it hurts worse to be to moisturised,sometimes it's comfiest to be dry.
902 2018-06-30 21:47:04 Huckabee is a mouthy crook with a bible in his hand.  He can take a bribe happily from any oil rich country.
903 2018-06-30 21:47:03 First: Trump created jump in oil prices by backing out of Iranian deal. Second: Trump tweets that he asks Saudi Arabia to bail him out. Third: Saudi’s say Trump never asked. Moral of story: Trump creates problem, then lies and covers up with more lies. #TrumpLiesMatter #BeAVoter
904 2018-06-30 21:47:01 The oil industry isnt collapsing
905 2018-06-30 21:46:51 Maybe you shoukd ask Mr. Tillerson how the oil thing works...oh, maybe he would not answer your call...
906 2018-06-30 21:46:48     is she ready ?
907 2018-06-30 21:46:32 Yes that’s what I’m trying, hemp oil is great for your skin
908 2018-06-30 21:46:27 Whip together 4 cups Ahi Tuna with 8 oz dips. Mix into  Olive Oil. Boil. Serve to your worst enemy.
909 2018-06-30 21:46:22 lead to as much reconciliation as is possible in the future. I think supporting pipelines is a major regression regarding reconciliation -- even if Trudeau did it to avoid Chinese legal action over oil supplies, I think other alternatives could have been pursued & I'd rather ...
910 2018-06-30 21:46:18 Reminds me... I should oil my ropes.. never know when you might need them.
911 2018-06-30 21:46:08 "Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production."
912 2018-06-30 21:45:45 You know that thing when you bite into a garlic knot and it explodes everywhere and now you have oil all over your dress? YEAH ME TOO.
913 2018-06-30 21:45:29 Fuck oil changes
914 2018-06-30 21:45:21 Made waffles & bacon for breakfast. After my morning shower, put some Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum, The Ordinary Marula Oil, SPF. Now I’m drinking my green juice. She’s feeling ~~~cÜt3~~~ today
915 2018-06-30 21:45:19 Jessica Hernandez  I am sauteing a chicken breast in olive oil with some fresh ground garlic and sea salt and sprinkled Rosemary from your garden on it. O M G it's so fragrant!!
916 2018-06-30 21:45:14 @ImNotScottySire for the fire wallet put just regular lighter fluid, no special "oil" needed! Or maybe even tiki torch fluid? Havent tried that tho 
917 2018-06-30 21:45:09 Just walked home from work..... It’s so fucking hot. Stay home, play video games, and hit the oil pen weather.
918 2018-06-30 21:45:02 Getting ready to put in my June doTerra essential oil order if anyone needs anyt ... #necklaces #jewelry #cats
919 2018-06-30 21:44:43 So first of all, my stomachs has been killing today. Then my nose gets all blocked and I have to sniff some olbas oil. Then when I finally think it’s over, I find a tonsil stone. Life’s good.
920 2018-06-30 21:44:38 Make sure there is no palm oil in the peanut butter as well.
921 2018-06-30 21:44:20 of course the King agreed -- Trump had at least 8 holdings in Saudi Arabia and probably blackmailed him into release more oil so his image will improve!
922 2018-06-30 21:44:19 For African/Super Curly Hair: Put 2 tbsp coconut oil and 4 tbsp of honey in a bowl and heat briefly in the microwave. Leave it in the hair for 20-30 minutes and then rinse your hair with lukewarm water. The oil nourishes the hair, the honey strengthens the hair structure.
923 2018-06-30 21:44:19 I got 99 problems 
& coconut oil solves like 87 of them 
 
924 2018-06-30 21:43:54 Lol my process:
1. Rub coconut oil liberally on my face. It immediately removes  the makeup
2. Clean with a face wipe
3. Repeat 1 and 2
4. Wash my face with black soap and water twice
5. Pat dry
6. Moisturize
925 2018-06-30 21:43:52 How can we make it 500 per person? With conservatives standing in the way of technological progress for the oil lobbies, we need to make more natural carbon sinks in the mean time.
926 2018-06-30 21:43:45 Y’all do realize you’re paying the mechanic to also inspect what else is wrong w your car when you get an oil change right..? Like you’re literally paying, they’re just doing what they’re supposed to. It’s up to you if you want to fix the problem.
927 2018-06-30 21:43:43 Looks like you could use an oil boy? Or in my case and oil man 
928 2018-06-30 21:43:42 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
929 2018-06-30 21:43:41 oil or acrylic?
930 2018-06-30 21:43:41 President like yeah I put in a call to the prince Saudi about oil it’s too high. Ok no problem done. All the people shorting oil just lost their ass on a phone call lol
931 2018-06-30 21:43:32 ７月１０日はオイルの日。 
雑学記
「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。

OIL！
932 2018-06-30 21:43:31 18$ for an inspection sticker  and my oil light just came on. Annoyed...
933 2018-06-30 21:43:26 And the Hill does not call Trump a liar! Unless only the interns are working ...they should have known one call to a cartel member doesn’t get a deal done. Also, they want the oil prices above their break even point so the can make more PROFIT!
934 2018-06-30 21:43:09 I am a proud Canadian your honorable! My hat is off to you Mr. Trudeau ! Many thanks for forcing the pipeline forward ! Canada needs a reliable and cost effective way to transport our oil.
                  Yours truly, 
                           Peter Driesel
935 2018-06-30 21:43:06 That's because they have banned drilling where oil is known to be. Innovation has come along way and they need to continue. I think we can be less gas/oil dependent in the future.
936 2018-06-30 21:43:01 And I don’t blame you. Any one with a mortgage and kids needs a stable job. Oil industry is still too volatile and perhaps allways will be.
937 2018-06-30 21:42:56 The sinister side of me kinda wants them to get their Iran war finally started as then KSA oil in reach of Iran would burn so quickly and with it burn down the whole kingdom, world economy and US empire in the fallout. 
But accelerationism is a poison fruit, I know, I know.
938 2018-06-30 21:42:55 Yo, this oil change place is getting on my nerves.
939 2018-06-30 21:42:55 Hahah You poor thing. Don’t forget to use aloe vera or coconut oil for the burn!!
940 2018-06-30 21:42:52 Selling books as well as snake oil, nice to you have other irons in the fire for when you're out of office.
941 2018-06-30 21:42:32 That "oil" is tar destined for China.  Do your research.
942 2018-06-30 21:42:27 The sun is one thirsty bitch today y'all sucking oil straight out my cock
943 2018-06-30 21:42:03 Drain/replace all fluids (oil, transmission, coolant, fuel), fresh battery, start her up and see what works and what doesn't. Look for dry rotted hoses and belts.
944 2018-06-30 21:42:02 And the earth will run out of oil that much faster!
945 2018-06-30 21:41:59 My father in law. He grew up with nothing to become the CEO of an oil company. Each day he got up early to greet the drivers, ask about their families, and send them on their way with a kind word ... and an apple. He embodies the word integrity- in his personal life and business.
946 2018-06-30 21:41:59 Makaboo, pose toi, bois un thé, fais des gâtés à tes chats, détends toi, passe ta soirée tranquillou.
Et c’est pas un bouton de fièvre qui va te défigurer, t’es magnifique. Pour aider à le cicatriser utilise la tea tree oil si tu en as et gratte pas...
947 2018-06-30 21:41:50 Hello troupe Lip smacking n Groom bonding...I went out, walked to the beach pulled a large plastic oil container out of the sea then walked down to John guitars, practiced bass for nearly two hours and power walked home.
Wish I'd seen the #FRAARG game...YIP
948 2018-06-30 21:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
949 2018-06-30 21:41:33 Thursday:  Got hold of my birth certificate without a hitch.  Yesterday:  Stymied in further efforts to secure various odds and ends, but bought some body oil and some more sunscreen and enjoyed elderflower lemonade at Whole Foods.  Today:  Laundry.
950 2018-06-30 21:41:28 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
951 2018-06-30 21:41:27 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
952 2018-06-30 21:41:25 I just splashed fucking hot oil on my fucking lip! WTF!
953 2018-06-30 21:41:24 Oil is quite flammable … what have you done?
954 2018-06-30 21:41:16 Oil "find"  ?
955 2018-06-30 21:41:12 Productive Saturday, Parkrun, car oil, filters & sparkplugs changed and fully cleaned inside and out, well it was getting knee deep inside.!!!!! Race entered for Sunday, chilling with a cold beer and radio  
956 2018-06-30 21:40:59 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
957 2018-06-30 21:40:50 Would you rather she get money from pacs? It costs money to run a campaign. Support those who you want to represent us anyway you can. I’d rather see a politician funded by their constituents than big pharma, oil, nra, etc.
958 2018-06-30 21:40:46 To take a nap or do oil change on my car and clean the truck ughhh
959 2018-06-30 21:40:46 Well, that should help the new Saudi- Russian oil monopoly get off to a good start,  just like your mobster boss wants.
960 2018-06-30 21:40:40 @J9Krokey , @ManInTheHoody needs your “Voodoo Oil” recipe for big spray!!
961 2018-06-30 21:40:28 De-bagged as soon as they enter politics by big pharma, oil companies, coal and oligarchs! 
962 2018-06-30 21:40:25 たらこって美味いよな！
963 2018-06-30 21:40:22 In the age of fake news, disinformation, misinformation and deceit, we can all agree on one thing and one thing only: 15/19 were Saudi. #trump #iran #middleeast #oil #petrodollar #saudiarabia #crownprince #mbs #911 #clinton #brexit #putin #russia #opec #GameOfThrones #marvel

965 2018-06-30 21:39:56 i like my avocado with some olive oil and salt 
966 2018-06-30 21:39:56 Venezuela, but long time ago. Right now we barely export some oil
967 2018-06-30 21:39:46 Few things wake you up like rubbing jalapeño pepper oil into your eye...
968 2018-06-30 21:39:38 So easy-like getting your oil changed-or any other meaningless chore-right? What do you NOT understand? They are fleeing for their lives! Careful-your white privilege is showing.
969 2018-06-30 21:39:30 If you traded oil you got this down.
970 2018-06-30 21:39:19 Fridays when his kids are gone and the President breathes heavily, Paul Ryan silently whistles the #starspangledbanner
971 2018-06-30 21:39:01 It's holy oil, you can't get that many places these days. This witch she used must be something special.
972 2018-06-30 21:38:58 Cannot lie your way to lower oil prices. Economics do not work that way.
973 2018-06-30 21:38:56 What about the Yemen?Oh wait Saudi A. Can bomb the shit out of them since they don't have oil
974 2018-06-30 21:38:54 What ? What terrorists ? U mean the sunni ones in Iraq and Syria ? The ones saudi and us sponsored to bring chaos so U warmongering mofos can have cheap oil ?
How about u mind your own damn business for a change ? Wasnt that Trump's policy during campain ? Why did he change ?
975 2018-06-30 21:38:40 If you have the ability, try lavender essential oil with aloe.
976 2018-06-30 21:38:11 Do you think all this Mr A or B defected to APC is a miracle. The $1b and $322m are the oil that grease the palm of those defecting, else you get roped into one crime or the other. God help us so a killer squad does not become the plan B
977 2018-06-30 21:37:56 Good for turkana people.this oil is corrupted.
978 2018-06-30 21:37:22 where can I get a keg of CBD oil
979 2018-06-30 21:36:51 They can't remember that... Because they have a sleeping brain cells like oil (ororo) 
980 2018-06-30 21:36:47 Or that look could be “mom do we have the right stops on our oil shorts? - very concerned about the quality of my next salmon filet”

982 2018-06-30 21:36:37 Each side of the crankshaft and slide piston down onto it then put the cups on. Replace oil pan gasket and oil filter, replace pan fill with 30wt oil (thickest u can get, great for older engines), put yer spark plugs back in and crank her up...bet she'll run like it's shoreleave!
983 2018-06-30 21:36:32 Ahh it eventually comes to #oil !!!
984 2018-06-30 21:36:29 Did we just prove something about saturated fatty acids in foods or about oil extracts? Did we just prove something about proteins in plants/animals or about a protein powder? Similiarly, we don't blaim fructose in fruits as a result of using fructose powder in a trial.
985 2018-06-30 21:36:22 No one even considered open borders. That’s Fox and Trump propaganda. Meanwhile, Ryan Zinke is selling off our parks to oil companies. Is that ok?

987 2018-06-30 21:36:10 If essential oils has a oil that  stops your friends/family from posting political articles on social media, they would be the real mvp.

988 2018-06-30 21:35:37 I had the hardest time sleeping for years due to anxiety and panic attacks. I started taking CBD oil in March and haven’t missed an hour of sleep. My anxiety and panic attacks are almost non existent now.
989 2018-06-30 21:35:30 Well, 2000 nukes and a giant lake of oil and natural gas also helps!

994 2018-06-30 21:34:51 Second that it's been a pleasure following you. Been trading crypto since 2013, traded oil and fx before that. There aren't many in this space who truly know wtf they are doing, you're one of the few who do. Keep it up and may the profits be with you... :-)
995 2018-06-30 21:34:40 hi love. baby I need a good tanning oil or something to pick up the speed on this tan .. can you help me ?
996 2018-06-30 21:34:34 Yes thank God there is no oil but the effects of global warming are plain to see.
997 2018-06-30 21:34:33 Good point!  Also, Trump tells us he asked KSA to increase oil production, but doesn't indicate that he asked KSA to stop bombing and starving millions of civilians in Yemen.  He's right that there's "fake news" against him, but this time it's not fake; Trump "outed" himself.
998 2018-06-30 21:34:19 Shale gas extraction is a 2-stage process:
Stage 1: huge amounts of borrowed money is burnt to produce oil & gas.
Stage 2: the oil & gas produced in stage 1 is burnt.
999 2018-06-30 21:34:18 I opened a cabinet and dropped a bottle of castor oil in the toilet and now i can’t find it like this mf done disappeared wtf

1004 2018-06-30 21:33:26 Popped her pistons eh? Well, you could get a set of rod bearings and an oil pan gasket set and new filter n oil...pull the spark plugs then the oil pan..each rod will easily slide up the cylinders providing there's no damage to the walls and once u slide one up u put one bearing
1005 2018-06-30 21:33:21 I wonder how much oil prices have dropped since this announcement?
1006 2018-06-30 21:33:11 Something along the lines of the Montgomery bus boycott is due.  Oil would  hit the hardest. The will to do it is required.
1007 2018-06-30 21:32:59 What about a 25% tariff on autos and retaliation that would follow, and/or $100+ oil prices that spur re-think Fed trajectory, of which, by the way, the mkt is already skeptical of 2019's 3 hikes?
1008 2018-06-30 21:32:52 Oil prices always skyrocket under republicans. Why don’t you check with President Obama how he kept those gas prices at at minimum during his 8 years in office? I’m sure he has some tips you can use.
1009 2018-06-30 21:32:43 Preparing for a beach vacation and I decided to sit down and list the risks we willing pay $$$ to go Dodge:
1) Rip current

3) jellyfish swarm

5) offshore oil rig explosion and chemicals
6) lightning strike
7) hurricane

1010 2018-06-30 21:32:39 I also LOVE that @CloakAndDagger features Roxxon Oil, Marvel’s evil oil company. I know, redundant.
1011 2018-06-30 21:32:27 #Compromise4BetterSouthSudan Sudan’s Ministry of Oil and Gas on Saturday has expected that oil  production in South Sudan’s Unity and  Thar Jath oil fields would resume  in less than two months. CEPO calls for allocation of quota of (40%-50% of the oil revenue as "Oil for Peace"

1017 2018-06-30 21:31:23 Yup, Trump and Salman have a good bond working together against the Deep State too, like Putin.
Hopefully this will roll back the oil prices a bit and won't backfire later.
They don't want to drop it too much.
1018 2018-06-30 21:31:20 Ah you know, the usual, spilled boiling fucking oil on half of my dick, so I'd say pretty good so far

1037 2018-06-30 21:27:51 Glad the Oil are spending 2.5m on an unproven KHL goalie while there’s an abundance of proven goalies available who will probably get less than that
1038 2018-06-30 21:27:45 Trump's lies are becoming bigger and bigger and easier to prove false. Recent ones include North Korea deal, Saudi Arabia oil, and that ICE is "liberating" towns from immigrant gangs.

1047 2018-06-30 21:26:03 As a major member, the UK has been instrumental in forming those laws. We also had major opt outs like not being in the Euro or Schengen. The only medicine we’re taking is the brexit snake oil.
1048 2018-06-30 21:25:58 I'm not doing a yard sale, but up to the same thing. Shredding day. We seriously had oil delivery bills from 1986. From when we lived at our first house. Ha!
1049 2018-06-30 21:25:55 I've spent the whole day brainstorming how I can get the word out about my CBD oil business and how I can get some customers.   If you have any ideas please share! And if you need the health benefits of CBD oil hit me up!
1050 2018-06-30 21:25:54 Pls remove any of your picture with uniform on social media. COAS just issued an order to print any pic with military uniform as evidence for trial. Pls info orders. @DefenceInfoNG @MurtalaIbin how true???
1051 2018-06-30 21:25:26 Also, doTerra essential oil brand has a marvellous blend called Clary Calm which contains, obviously, clary sage. It's awesome for balancing hormones too, and when used in the latter half of your cycle reduces PMS symptoms.

1057 2018-06-30 21:24:18 Exactly. Finland, Norway and Sweden are Nationalist. They have successful socialism because they are tribal. They also have enough natural resources (oil) to fund their social programs through export.
1058 2018-06-30 21:24:15 Gotta prop up that Petro-Dollar at all cost!! My Cronies aren't making enough profit!! Pump that oil!! Spill that oil!! OOPS!! Who woulda seen that coming?!
1059 2018-06-30 21:24:09 And when governments have poor policy that increases regulation on the best oil field in the world, show frustrating inability to build pipelines and add useless taxes... it BECOMES their fault.   But don’t tell me, tell the masses that are fleeing

1069 2018-06-30 21:22:59 Putin has billions of barrels of oil that he wants to sell, but the US sanctions are stopping him so he needs Trump to lift the US sanctions against him.  And Trump will try to do that because Putin will pay him millions.
1070 2018-06-30 21:22:59 Regular Traders and Investors: "We're bullish on oil in the short term." 
Oil Specialists: "We're bullish on oil in the long term, and this may represent the best buying opportunity since the financial crisis lows."

1075 2018-06-30 21:22:02 DYK? Over 500000 jobs in Canada are associated with and support the oil and gas industry!   That is a lot of hardworking Canadians!
1076 2018-06-30 21:21:57 Trump asking the Saudi’s to produce up to 2 mb/d is 100% bullish for oil. He just wants assurance that he can cut Iran & Venezuela exports to nearly zero and not have a massive price spike that is his fault.... @Bamabroker
1077 2018-06-30 21:21:40 Have to be careful to use the correct weight oil for butt-cheek lube. Too thick, doesn't lubricate right, too thin, it'll smoke.
1078 2018-06-30 21:21:30 #NeverDrinkAnd drive.  No trigger any bit of oil going in the flames.  It could degenerate your life, too.  Stick to drinking water, sodas, soft drinks, etc.  No alcoholic types.

1083 2018-06-30 21:20:59 This is all a distraction to keep the people fighting with each other, just wait for July 16 Trump/Putin summit, keep your eye on oil prices, notice they ate up your tax cut? And your refund next year, well that will be smaller too
1084 2018-06-30 21:20:38 Although that’s what was said publicly and I guess we have to take their word for it I have a hard time believing it because my thought was they’re letting oil rise throwing a bone to Putin to get his cooperation on some geopolitical issues. He needs cash.
1085 2018-06-30 21:20:37 おはゅ
1086 2018-06-30 21:20:32 How about you tell it to the oil companies, the ones actually responsible for gouging us on gas

1091 2018-06-30 21:19:40 Same here! I didn’t expect this to be so much fun.
As for 2022 there’s going to be a lot of oil money involved. That’s all I’ll say
1092 2018-06-30 21:19:40 Terrible decision for this country!  Trump is making a serious mistake. This is padding Saudi pockets and will harm American oil production. This in turn hurts the stock market. That effects many peoples retirement accounts. Bad policy.
1093 2018-06-30 21:19:33 Brush in your favorite oil and throw on a cold wet durag before you leave the crib. It’s hot out there today
1094 2018-06-30 21:19:23 Oil  prices will go up from now , because Trump’s tweet clear that no oil in market
1095 2018-06-30 21:19:11 Obama used fake reports of people being turned away at the border as "being deported." More lies.  BTB.. he didn't create 14 million jobs or make the stock market go up either.. that was done by big oil, new drilling techniques and fracking.

1104 2018-06-30 21:18:18 FUCK @Walmart in Greensburg’s Automotive area. Every time I’m here they’re just plain rude and they take FOREVER I came to get my oil changed over an hour ago. The guy told me it’ll take about 45min to an hour if I had some shopping to do.
1105 2018-06-30 21:18:17 You’re absolutely right. Let’s bring the troops from the Middle East so they stop “helping” the countries. Or is it okay to help when there oil involved?
1106 2018-06-30 21:18:09 And also, like any world leaders actually listen to him? “Ok Donnie, I’ll kick some butt and raise oil production because YOU asked me to”. 
1107 2018-06-30 21:18:08 Haha no worries, if they're so dry that they're hurting, maybe you can mix some sugar (not too fine, bigger crystals are good and they'll dissolve into finer crystals by themselves) and Olive oil and gently scrub your elbows with that.
1108 2018-06-30 21:18:01 Liar. ‘Saudi Arabia confirmed the call but not the agreemt, according to the AP
"During the call, the two leaders stressed the need to make efforts to maintain the stability of oil markets & the growth of the global economy," said a statemt from the state-run Saudi Press Agency.’
1109 2018-06-30 21:18:01 You were real innocent when you destroyed iraq for oil and gold, yep real victims
1110 2018-06-30 21:17:59 Only the Moslem countries say that and they're so xenophobic that they think of it like it's the crusades and no non Muslim state should be there. The rest need oil. Give me a break. BDS is about the destruction of Israel as the world's only Jewish State. Warfare, Lawfare, ROR.

1112 2018-06-30 21:17:56 I don’t even rinse my rice. 1:2 is my rice to water ratio. Bring to a quick boil, & lower the flame. Stir it ONCE to distribute salt/butter or oil. And dont stir again. Do not stir again lol

1114 2018-06-30 21:17:54 Love the flavor of that oil!
1115 2018-06-30 21:17:43 I don't need a guy to wash and style my hair or give me facials but massages are nice, North Indian Hindu Prashant and South Indian Hindu Sarat both give the best oil massages, Sarat likes to sniff my hair, play in it, massage me, his boob massages
1116 2018-06-30 21:17:43 Would be funny if during independence negotiations with Westminster we just said, because we could, "right we'll block our water and our oil trade with England" and see how much we get out of it. We are owed A LOT.
1117 2018-06-30 21:17:39 #Islamabad: The caretaker government has increased the price of petrol, diesel and kerosene oil for the month of July 2018, as recommended by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (#OGRA).
New Prices Petrol Rs 99.50 diesel Rs 119.31 kerosene oil Rs 87.70 & light diesel oil Rs 80.91
1118 2018-06-30 21:17:37 The Saudis already said they would be increasing oil production. You didn’t do squat, Trump, but go ahead as usual and try to take all the credit. 

Btw, it’s TOO, not TO - but you wouldn’t know that.
1119 2018-06-30 21:17:28 I remember reading an article about peak oil in the late 70's which quoted an alleged expert as saying that there were millions of barrels of oil locked in shale formations all around the world and we'd never be able to extract any of it. Never say never I guess.
1120 2018-06-30 21:17:14 There's plenty of oil being produced. Why don't you tell all your criminal pals to stop manipulating the price per barrel. You lie so effortlessly.
1121 2018-06-30 21:17:11 Fucking vegetable oil? You don;t know what the fuck you are talking about.
1122 2018-06-30 21:17:04 Well, we can only hope that he would give it up. Drilling Oil's bad for the environment of course. #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
1123 2018-06-30 21:17:02 I would have been cheap and lazy, bought some sour gummies from Amazon so I didn't have to go out, and then dropped some thc oil on it\rolled it in keef.
1124 2018-06-30 21:17:00 I told my brother to put sum gas in my car since he usin it to buy cookin oil nd he told me “u betta sit yo ass down”  ugh niggas are ruthless
1125 2018-06-30 21:16:47 Oil  prices will go up from now , because Trump’s tweet clear that no oil in market
1126 2018-06-30 21:16:42 “Yeah, sure- though I /don’t/ have oil... there might be some lotion in the bathroom.” 

he shrugged with a smirk, settling down his coffee.
1127 2018-06-30 21:16:36 Hey, if you were really wanting to MAGA, you’d advocate for independence from foreign oil. And for renewable energy. Dork.
1128 2018-06-30 21:15:59 7月はもう枯れ場でしょう。隠居する。oilは買いかな
1129 2018-06-30 21:15:10 One job, man. One job. I'm not driving you to the station in the morning anymore.

1132 2018-06-30 21:14:59 It's all about the  oil & money ....smh

@realDonaldTrump is out here to enrich himself.
1133 2018-06-30 21:14:57 I have ran out of maybes for us. I only have a few ifs to get me thru this lifetime, if only i get over you, i will then choose not to say maybe.
1134 2018-06-30 21:14:56 My mom greased my scalp every day when I was little with this grease olive oil and hair mayonnaise that shit stink but it’s probably why my hair long now
1135 2018-06-30 21:14:46 NY yeah that I can I was a motorcycle i get castor oil for the low #lifehack if you can come home to turn into a cat toy
1136 2018-06-30 21:14:32 He already did cuzzo.. He is getting that oil money at PSG!! But i mean i guess he could always get more
1137 2018-06-30 21:14:20 Translation:  "Scottish oil revenues bail out the UK a bit more."
1138 2018-06-30 21:14:17 Can Saudi Arabia increase oil output unilaterally? Does it not need consensus of other OPEC states like Iran and Venezuela?
1139 2018-06-30 21:13:55 Connie told me to take my eyelashes off with oil and my vision is going blurry
1140 2018-06-30 21:13:49 yeah I meant that rhetorically of course they will 
Iran is looking at other measures to export oil which means consolidation with possible partners. could bring them closer to BRI either way the neocons will be displeased for true
1141 2018-06-30 21:13:33 #OOTT #Oil
#SaudiArabia's announcement of 1M increase post #OPEC's vague statement on June 22 forced #WTI to gap down 100+ pt at last Sunday open. Now that #Trump has asked #Saudi king to add 1M more oil, what reaction will oil markets reflect when #CME resumes the trading?
1142 2018-06-30 21:13:22 “Well, you know, the primary reason we’re with Saudi Arabia is because we need the oil. Now we don’t need the oil so much. Look Saudi is going to be in big trouble pretty soon and they’re going to need help...we get nothing for it and they’re making a billion dollars a day.” 8/15
1143 2018-06-30 21:13:10 @SalVulcano Hey ... go to a barbershop after you've mowed the lawn,  eaten a tuna sandwich,  changed the oil on your car,  etc.  
1144 2018-06-30 21:13:07 Big oil can. The smaller operator who do the work can’t.

1146 2018-06-30 21:13:05 get the panthenol spray and leave that shit on to soak in, its really calming. Anything with aloe vera is also great and dont forget to moisturize a lot (coconut oil) cause otherwise your skin is gonna peel off
1147 2018-06-30 21:13:05 You know it’s hot when Vaseline turns into Baby Oil.
1148 2018-06-30 21:12:45 post malone probably smells like french fry oil
1149 2018-06-30 21:12:45 I'd gently scrub them first and then use petroleum jelly (like vaseline) but if you don't have that at home, you can rub in a few drops of Olive oil maybe. It's your elbows, so you don't have to worry about clogging pores really
1150 2018-06-30 21:12:43 They will just ship oil to U.S. to swell weekly EIA inventory until November. The real facts are not relevant to the market.
1151 2018-06-30 21:12:36 The oil industry can do all it wants, sooner or later consumers will demand EV’s. #innovationalwayswins
1152 2018-06-30 21:12:24 “Riiight. And I went to Greece for the olive oil.”

She had also gone for the women.
1153 2018-06-30 21:12:24 Check oil light came on in my car today so I did the responsible thing and put a dunkin doughnuts napkin in front of it
1154 2018-06-30 21:12:10 Agreed, but why don’t you have solidarity with other oppressed people’s like when the government allowed mercenaries for oil companies to brutalize indigenous water protectors? I never saw you ask obama to put an end to it. Why
1155 2018-06-30 21:12:08 No they weren’t. The Earth had much more vegetation and we hadn’t discovered oil and coal as energy sources yet (the main sources of CO2 emissions). I actually have a masters degree in studies regarding this.
1156 2018-06-30 21:12:06 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
1157 2018-06-30 21:12:02 No B on this tweet. Remember a divorce cut the pie in half - and then government attacks on the energh industry (and a drop in oil price) dismantled a lot of what was left - and some charity work took a bunch - so not much left. 

I will be ok though...

1162 2018-06-30 21:11:51 President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had received assurances from King Salman of Saudi Arabia that the kingdom will increase oil production, "maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels" in response to turmoil in Iran and Venezuela. Saudi Arabia acknowledged the call took place,

1165 2018-06-30 21:11:42 I wish I could retweet that point 1000x. 

On the world stage Canada has been played like idiots. Like babies with candy. 

Our oil rivals donate a couple million dollars to environmental groups and we sabatauged our own economy of 10s of billions in future income.
1166 2018-06-30 21:11:34 I got a drive thru oil change for the first time ever and this is terrible. I have a hard time saying no to them and they ask me to get stuff done every 2 minutes. I’m gonna end up leaving here with a new car
1167 2018-06-30 21:11:21 You do know that when SA increses production, the price of oil goes down. That means oil companies here will have to lowere their prices too, they'll lose money. Maybe you should learn a little about econmics before you make economic decisions. #25th45 #StupidPOTUS

1170 2018-06-30 21:11:08 Wow, my hero. Not!! We don’t import oil from Iran.
1171 2018-06-30 21:11:01 Okay, it took us longer than we had wanted to spend, due to the 100° temp and 6000% humidity, but I’ve taught my daughter to change the oil, transmission fluid, transfer case fluid, differential fluid and the air filter on the jeep.

It was a good day.

Next weekend, spark plugs.
1172 2018-06-30 21:10:57 Coconut oil and sugar is so good for exfoliating. My legs look so nice and feel so smooth.

1180 2018-06-30 21:09:57 You understand that oil is a limited resource, right? Maybe there are other ways to become independent of the OPEC controlled oil market. Ever heard of #Tesla?
1181 2018-06-30 21:09:53 Don't you own stock in oil and gas though?
1182 2018-06-30 21:09:47 I see, it's true Trump has been making a lot of demands recently, not least the one of Saudi Arabia to pump more oil in order to flood the market and assist in bankrupting Venezuela and Iran.
It's now clear he's not going to make America great again, but make America hated again.
1183 2018-06-30 21:09:46 And he's pissed off the people we usually but most of our oil from in North and South America.
1184 2018-06-30 21:09:14 Keep this energy when I make oil

1214 2018-06-30 21:03:30 Of course we and our society uses oil.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t oppose by projects or argue for policy and infrastructure that reduces our dependence on oil.

1237 2018-06-30 21:01:08 Of course they did.  With the newly imposed sanctions on Iran, the Saudi's see an opportunity to rake in billions by increasing oil production (to pick up the void).  It has absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  What a B.S. artist.  Even the WSJ had an article on it today.
1238 2018-06-30 21:00:54 This is true, but they're fried in the same oil as everything else, which would make them a no-no, at least for hardcore veggies :)

Essential oils are nature’s purest essence of the botanical they are pulled from. The “oil” is extracted primarily through steam distillation or cold pressing. They are often called the “life-force” of the plant.

I thought it was nice that you are secure and safe from the horrors of the coming brexit... so aye it is only nice for me - but my job on the rigs isnt safe as Sir Ian Wood told us that oil is running out...  despite the humungous finds West of Shetland
1261 2018-06-30 20:57:59 Moving isn’t fun at all but moving in this Texas heat just plain sux! #overitalready
1262 2018-06-30 20:57:41 Crude oil stock is falling doe to export and not due to demand. Market has got it wrong
1263 2018-06-30 20:57:35 Oil control? Is she a fraud?
1264 2018-06-30 20:57:09 My cat has switched from ferociously licking cologne or lotion off of my body to licking lavender oil. It’s gotta be better for us right?
1265 2018-06-30 20:57:08 Bitch no you can’t get a oil change and bitch NO you can’t just get a free gram tf. Bye leave
1266 2018-06-30 20:57:04 @solt_oil しおみさん、初めまして。茶良助と申します。影ながら作品と呟きを拝見しておりましたが、フォローバックとヴィリーアンソロ企画について拡散下さりありがとうございました。こちら呟きが雑多で大変恐縮ですが、どうぞよろしくお願い致します。
1267 2018-06-30 20:57:01 Tea tre oil is VERY VERY VERY harsh on skin i used it when i got my nose pierced and it only made it worse
1268 2018-06-30 20:56:59 Oil everywhere! And metal! Yeah 
1269 2018-06-30 20:56:48 Ok. Who sent me a hand fan, avocado oil and travel bottles? We were not registered for this lol
1270 2018-06-30 20:56:29 You’re aware that none of those hijackers were from the countries Trump is banning? They’re mostly from Saudi Arabia, but he won’t go against them because of the oil.
1271 2018-06-30 20:56:16 Yes, and compliant economically of course because they have oil.  
Also Iran have ended oil transactions in dollars & now use the euro. 
This is treason as far as the US is concerned,
1272 2018-06-30 20:56:14 Don’t sleep on wild hair growth oil ay ! Does work wonders 
1273 2018-06-30 20:55:52 Got this tanning oil. My new shades. Y'all catch me at the lake 
1274 2018-06-30 20:55:44 Seeing all the lobby-work (and what not) of all ICE-profiteurs, oil industry and ICE-car-makers mainly, I'm still surprised that the latter started creating BEVs actually. BMW started, when ?, 2008/2009? I can only imagine the pressure that created.
1275 2018-06-30 20:55:41 They need to show your match vs Oil King on stream.
1276 2018-06-30 20:55:40 Oil massage. Yes ma'am.
1277 2018-06-30 20:55:37 I used to do It all the time and then my drain got clogged and i didn’t know why and ryan was like probably from all that oil 
1278 2018-06-30 20:55:34 I love grape seed oil though.
1279 2018-06-30 20:55:27 The only industry in Rivers State is politics and that is not good at all. With the fluctuations in oil prices as well as the gradual but steady decline in the importance of oil globally, investing and diversifying the sources of revenue will be ideal.
1280 2018-06-30 20:55:27 Saudis also signaling OPEC lost any relevance to them, consistent with global oil demand peaking in 5-10 years. Taking Iranian market share now since it’s the last chance b/f demand starts going down
1281 2018-06-30 20:55:23 my new face cleansing oil has Rosehip, grape seed AND jojoba oil!
1282 2018-06-30 20:55:10 Sautee sliced green onions and thinly sliced red bell pepper in a bit of olive oil with some oregano or basil for 3 minutes, toss in a handful of sliced olives. Mix in oven-proof dish with crumbled goat cheese and two whisked eggs. Bake at 375 for 20ish minutes. So good & easy!
1283 2018-06-30 20:54:56 If you’re long oil over the weekend it’s  time to get religious
1284 2018-06-30 20:54:56 1.Signatories to Budapest Memorandum should have acted as soon as Putin green man set their foot in Crimea
2. Complete isolation of Russia & disconnection from SWIFT
3. Stop buying Russian gas
4. Negotiate increase of oil production by OPEC. Low oil prices hurt Putin
1285 2018-06-30 20:54:44 Please don't be angry, I sell beard oil 
1286 2018-06-30 20:54:35 As soon as I can buy Tesla I will, oil driven cars are a thing of the past in my mind!!
1287 2018-06-30 20:54:15 Trust me when i tell you that tax cuts benefit every american , if not directly then indirectly . Also saudi arabia agrees to ramp up oil production to lower gas prices . Man Trump keeps winning . #TRUMP2020 #MAGA #WalkAway #PENCE2024
1288 2018-06-30 20:54:07 Annex Mexico. Go into it like we did with Saddam and start with the cartels. Take their land, then take their resources, then give them all citizenship. We'd have enough materials, metals, oil, etc to last us the next two hundred years or more. They wanna be American? OK.
1289 2018-06-30 20:54:05 Pour two handfuls of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
1290 2018-06-30 20:53:52 So, Vanguard 500 index fund is "Big Oil" now? That article is a smear-piece with zero substance.
1291 2018-06-30 20:53:50 He's getting the money upfront. My suggestion for paying for the wall is cut off their foreign aid and tax there oil a dollar a barrel.

but I find it cute when stupid people say stupid things because they wouldn't know research if it bit them.
1292 2018-06-30 20:53:32 mpl oil ? where can on get it
1293 2018-06-30 20:53:23 Went to get my oil changed 3 weeks ago and invested in a new battery..
1294 2018-06-30 20:53:21 Because the oil is in Iraq, US don’t give a fuck about Mexico unless they got something to offer
1295 2018-06-30 20:53:21 Have e you tried cbd oil
1296 2018-06-30 20:53:16 You gonna trade to be more “equal”?

I’m not. My mama didn’t raise a fool, and changing oil is disgusting and dirty.  
1297 2018-06-30 20:53:11 I saw the O this morning.  Obama?  Oil?
1298 2018-06-30 20:52:49 #UnitedNations you must put sanctions against #USA, if kids are not re-united, then
No OIL into USA!
1299 2018-06-30 20:52:17 True. Italian olive oil is often 'pimped', maybe faked is the better word. Cheap oils are added. There were a lot of cases here in Austria.
1300 2018-06-30 20:52:13 Don’t tell me we’re gonna have to settle for another corporate gas & oil dem?
1301 2018-06-30 20:52:06 Protein shakes are very useful. I added olive oil for extra Calories.
1302 2018-06-30 20:52:05 The U.S. hasn't bought Venezuelan oil for over 10 years. 
You are lying again.
Fix prescription drug prices..
Fulfill a real promise. 
Then resign before you are forced out in disgrace
1303 2018-06-30 20:51:54 Since the lifting of sanctions in 2016, Iran has returned as a major oil supplier, selling around 2.5 million barrels a day, or more than 2 percent of global supplies. NYT
이란이 공급하는 일 2백만 배럴을 대체하는 것이 쉽지은 않다는 점이 문제
1304 2018-06-30 20:51:52 I hate being *that person and this post isn’t about it but pls be careful with anything tea tree oil, it’s not safe around pets unless it’s very very diluted
1305 2018-06-30 20:51:47 You could find all the relief you need in your home with treatments such as:
~ cold or warm compresses 
~ olive oil
~ garlic
~ tea tree oil
~ hydrogen peroxide
1306 2018-06-30 20:51:44 This is my 4th oil change today 
1307 2018-06-30 20:50:56 Why not buy Canadian oil ?
1308 2018-06-30 20:50:54 I've read oil Kings, the Kingdom, a history of wahabbism, books, by aburish on the me and the prize.
1309 2018-06-30 20:50:38 Next time try peppermint oil (it’s a lifesaver) put 3 drops on your temples and back Of your neck and try wearing sunglasses (even inside) that should help
1310 2018-06-30 20:50:32 $1.36 for gas?!? Looks like im investing in a backyard oil refinery..
1311 2018-06-30 20:50:22 One time it was so humid my oil painting fucking undried
1312 2018-06-30 20:50:21 need to oil my scalp
1313 2018-06-30 20:50:18 Baby oil. Or they make ourdoor tanning lotion at Walmart.
1314 2018-06-30 20:50:17 Don’t even argue with them? There is no point these people are deluded if they stay in the sun for ages that would be good for us all... enjoy bring your oil xx
1315 2018-06-30 20:50:08 when it’s this hot out i highly recommend keeping a spray bottle full of water by your bed and spritzing your face and then putting your face right by the fan. put a few drops of essential oil in the water too bae you deserve it
1316 2018-06-30 20:49:59 It removes excess oil without drying out your face, acne, dirt, bacteria, shrink your pores, tones your skin ... I love it
1317 2018-06-30 20:49:51 If one more person tells me to drink castor oil I’m gonna freak out.
1318 2018-06-30 20:49:50 Harper Government. I got years of extra debt, my great grandchildren will be paying off, his austerity measures only added $150 Billion to our debt while losing services & jobs. Harper may have let me put more in my TFSA. He put all our eggs into oil, deregulated enviro, FIPA
1319 2018-06-30 20:49:31  i still use it but i have to add coconut and tea tree oil to make it more of an antiperspirant
1320 2018-06-30 20:49:27 It’s a cheat, we had to make them ourselves from a side of smashed avocados and olive oil. @spitefuls
1321 2018-06-30 20:49:24 i hate oil changes 
1322 2018-06-30 20:49:22 Its time to buy oil from Iran ,in there local currency,we are already on Grey list,and iranis are suffering from un sactions
1323 2018-06-30 20:49:20 Trump asks Saudi Arabia to increase oil production (CNN Money)
1324 2018-06-30 20:49:07 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
1325 2018-06-30 20:49:06 Might be a little late but for future reference, put peppermint oil on your temples and behind your ears.
1326 2018-06-30 20:48:50 Honestly the ride is over now it's time to see if any news is real.  I live in Texas and Oil Business is insane to put it mildly so news like having 11 oil wells inline to be tapped is not a surprise at all.  Oil is booming in Texas I know this fact.  $CEI is Oil in Texas.
1327 2018-06-30 20:48:47 “I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!“ Said differently: your wish is our command... DC calls the shots
1328 2018-06-30 20:48:34 I’m honestly surprised my shit hasn’t  no worries tho I’m waiting in line for an oil change rn lmaoo
1329 2018-06-30 20:48:27 Me: *drops bottle of olive oil on floor, pour spout pops off, knocks over Hokkaido roll dough* SHIT!!!
Husband: do you need help or something?  Me: *imagines his face melting like the Nazi in Raiders* no, I’m fine.
1330 2018-06-30 20:48:15 I doubt Bush or Rubio would gotten tax cut, Alaska oil reserve, nok talks, human trafficking arrests,  Paris accord extortion, dropping Iran deal, Pacific bad trade deal, renegotiating nafta. No way.
1331 2018-06-30 20:47:53 CPP is an independent body and operates independently of the government Mr Coyne knows this he also has a vested interests in oil and gas and mining.
1332 2018-06-30 20:47:07 I need an oil change, but dammit it’s hot
1333 2018-06-30 20:46:59 Vegan fare today. Even vegan cake with coconut oil to replace butter and egg. Well done transition northwich.
1334 2018-06-30 20:46:57 You subscribe to the Too Wee - Too Poor - Too Stupid theory that the MSM has pumped doon yer throat for decades....understandable - but I have worked 27yrs in Oil & Gas and KNOW better- Scotland has amazing potential if only people were smart enough to see. #EyesWideOpen
1335 2018-06-30 20:46:56 Lol! Right!!! I just mixed some peppermint oil with water in a spray bottle and girl... it feels AMAZING!!
1336 2018-06-30 20:46:55 And yeah I think the the fuck not. Bros MAKE Bros go out and funnel beer using the same funnel I changed my oil with 2 hours ago.
1337 2018-06-30 20:46:27 honestly i need to learn to do this stuff myself, i know oil changes are easy but i dont exactly have anywhere to do it
1338 2018-06-30 20:46:21 Don’t forget the 2 this morning; ICE driving MS-16 away that he saw first hand & his call with Saudi Arabia to raise oil production to 2M per day (I believe Reuters reported it’s currently at 11M per day).  Everything is a lie.
1339 2018-06-30 20:46:01 — Crush some garlic and warm it up with extra virgin olive oil.After that, let it cool just above body temp & pour few drops into your ear (3-4 drops). It will help you at least to survive few nights.Of course you need to visit doctor as soon as you can and grab some drugs to use
1340 2018-06-30 20:45:47 Didnt wanna change my oil so took it to get it washed and seeviced and i got finessed lol oh well
1341 2018-06-30 20:45:42 Yes!  Awesome!  Hemp oil is great.  Hemp can be used in soooo many things!  This is awesome!
1342 2018-06-30 20:45:34 A smarter move would be to support businesses investing in free energy in order to reduce dependence on oil and reduce CO2 emissions.  But that would reduce the amount of $ going to your oil exec cronies, so we can’t have that.
1343 2018-06-30 20:45:33 You mean the post-war period with much higher economic growth than Thatcher, despite the latter having a ton of unearned windfalls of privatisation, oil discovery, and council house sell-off; all while doubling the national debt?
1344 2018-06-30 20:45:32 Dundun fried with palm oil?
1345 2018-06-30 20:45:32 #LuHan cdrama . In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together, and the music that brings harmony. Friedrich Nietzsche #quote
1346 2018-06-30 20:45:31 Oh you’re so F-cking amazing.  The saudis were the ones who took down the twin towers.  If you didn’t sanction Venezuela we could still get oil from them. GiVE THE CHILDREN BACK DO YOU HEAR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TODAY
1347 2018-06-30 20:45:23 #SonniesCorner... now I'm bare foot in the kitchen cooking for my family while hubby uses his toxic masculinity to get the oil changed
1348 2018-06-30 20:45:11 I was 36. Sent away for 6 wks by locum to 'see what happens'  (lump got angry!). Then GP drew diagram of how Oil of EP levels out my hormones. Reminded him Mum was diagnosed at 42, but still think my private health cover swung the referral.
1349 2018-06-30 20:45:06 Well, of course, OIL always speaks louder ... 911 terrorists from Saudi
1350 2018-06-30 20:45:06 Walmart, target , and ULTA sells castor oil . Helps a lot
1351 2018-06-30 20:45:00 Well from 12 June till 1 st July caretaker government has increased oil prices.On June 11,petrol price was Rs 87.70 and now it has soar up to Rs 99.50/ltr.Diesel has gone to Rs 119.Although they came for just two month,but they have put extra burden on our wallets.Shameful!
1352 2018-06-30 20:44:54 I saw that tweet and knew it was a lie. Saudi Arabia loves the high oil prices. They would not increase the production to lower prices to help Trump
1353 2018-06-30 20:44:29 I use peppermint oil. It usually works good for me. Depending on how bad it is.
1354 2018-06-30 20:44:26 I need my oil changed ; not moving my car unless they pay for it...
1355 2018-06-30 20:44:25 Exactly what Saudia Arabia and Russia wanted more oil production and Power in World Oil Reserves, feasible with US leaving Iran Deal and US Sanctions in Venezuela! Russia will also be pleased with no US sanctions on Nord Stream II!  It should make for a great Summit with Russia!
1356 2018-06-30 20:44:23 DR Congo to allow oil drilling in two national parks listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites and home to mountain gorillas, bonobos and other rare specieshttp://abbeyshop.website/2018/06/30/dr-congo-to-allow-oil-drilling-in-two-national-parks-listed-as-unesco-world-heritage-site...
1357 2018-06-30 20:44:13 Drop a beauty/health tip below. I’ll start. 

If your hair is prone to oil/greasiness, only shampoo the scalp, and only condition the length.
1358 2018-06-30 20:44:12 I agree with the conclusions of the article.  However, don’t see any references to an Oil & Gas industry representatives denigrating EVs?  Some in the industry are actively advocating EVs.
1359 2018-06-30 20:44:07 Did you get this agreement in writing this time? NK isn’t doing shit about nukes idiot. Oil isn’t the future also. Stop pushing a dying industry
1360 2018-06-30 20:43:43 I've been applying my hand lotion to keep it moist, but just now remember I was sent an oat hand repair lotion by @Auntievivi8, I'll try using that. Don't like having coconut oil on my hands for some reason
1361 2018-06-30 20:43:38 “Welp I blame Trump and North Korea for that one.” He giggled as he slumped into his chair. Though he was only trying to make light of the situation. It’s fucked up what people would do for land, money, and recourses. They would destroy themselves for just another cup of oil. Or—
1362 2018-06-30 20:43:09 Iran can produce oil but you are trying to prevent that for no good reason other than it was deal made by Obama.
1363 2018-06-30 20:42:54 May be true but you are trying to kill our jobs in the oil industry. Not good
1364 2018-06-30 20:42:51 Big oil and automobile companies in particular. They have a lot of pull in this world lol
1365 2018-06-30 20:42:47 Ohmygod sis same!!!my face is breaking out and I’m going crazy with the tea tree oil rn  but I have a lot tricks up my sleeve hon maybe I can help?
1366 2018-06-30 20:42:32 been at the pool for hoursssss cooking in coconut oil with Alisia 
1367 2018-06-30 20:41:53 This is only a back door step 2 support  which was responsible 4 global jihadi activities. Trump family must be benefiting from Saudi Arabia’s increased oil income. Shame.
1368 2018-06-30 20:41:35 With Trump talking about OPEC, Saudi Arabia, and oil - albeit in his garbled fashion - here are a few good history-oriented books to get a more accurate grasp of the story:
1369 2018-06-30 20:41:26 Tuna for the win! RT for tuna in oil, Fav for tuna in water.
1370 2018-06-30 20:41:22 I use Cedarwood oil and it helps me sleep 
1371 2018-06-30 20:41:14 Hello Michael. Thanks for contact us. Unfortunately, we do not recycle rotors, we only recycle batteries and oil. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks. Adam
1372 2018-06-30 20:41:11 Don't forget the planet* total cluster fuck we are facing... American oil companies knew about the effects of CO2 decades ago. Add that to American Capitalism.
1373 2018-06-30 20:40:58 babe. babe. i am coated. i have deet poisoning. i sweat lemongrass and peppermint oil. i have a wall of citronella candles and a fogger. i wear repellent clips on every seam. the beasts continue to feast upon me, unabated.
1374 2018-06-30 20:40:36 This woman at Valvoline was about to get cussed the fuck out she was being so rude to the mechanics and was like “I don’t trust mechanics you better not be ruining my car”. Like okay then bitch learn how to change your own oil you entitled little brat
1375 2018-06-30 20:40:29 Exactly what Saudia Arabia and Russia wanted to up oil production in OPEC! Feasible wit US leaving Iran deal and US sanctions in Venezuela! Also Russia will be pleased US will not apply Sancti
1376 2018-06-30 20:40:24 Oil money....
1377 2018-06-30 20:40:17 I know it! They had us on pins an needles and showed their asses and could have cared less at our convention! The disrespect was at. Now they want us to move on and support this one trick pony, snake oil salesman. The hell we will!  #NeverSanders
1378 2018-06-30 20:40:12 I thought that was an oil. Haha
1379 2018-06-30 20:40:07 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1380 2018-06-30 20:40:05 There’s oil here bra. Bring jobs to America
1381 2018-06-30 20:40:03 @edhenry 

I’ll bet Trump got the Saudis to increase oil production not only to lower oil prices but it shows Putin, just before the summit, Trump’s power and gives Trump more negotiating ammo.
1382 2018-06-30 20:40:01 Commander in chimp McTrumpcake says he has received assurances from king salman of saudi arabia that the kingdom will increase oil production
1383 2018-06-30 20:39:53 - shave with coconut oil instead of shaving cream
- exfoliate 2-3 times a week
- put on sunscreen if you are going swimming or tanning!!
- always put on lotion after showering!
- shower after working out or if you are sweating because you can get heat rashes
1384 2018-06-30 20:39:43 With all the buy Canadian advice how can we possibly buy a Canada gas and oil? Mostly foreign products!
1385 2018-06-30 20:39:42 This "unknown region" doesn't just involve the Oil & Gas, but many industries, as data exposes over £30bn in exports one year allotted to UK, but missing from country totals! (similar figures of ~£20bn for imports unallocated)

This obviously makes for inaccurate results...
1386 2018-06-30 20:39:40 That's not 100% true. There was a crucial point in the 1970s when the Shah of Iran kept pushing for OPEC to raise the oil price, and Saudi Arabia undercut him in order to win US favor. But it's also worth observing that the Shah probably had the market wrong anyway.
1387 2018-06-30 20:39:37 Did u get vegetable oil at the cash n carry?....wheres Manuel im snowed under here ffs
1388 2018-06-30 20:39:30 But you may say, then why are we still in Afghanistan?  They don’t have oil.  True. They don’t, but they have poppy plants which makes opium.

We’re there to protect poppy plants that make heroin for big Rx.  It’s partly we have skyrocketing Rx overdoses.

It’s for Rx profits.
1389 2018-06-30 20:39:29 My mum keeps telling me to put coconut oil in my hair like its not her genetics making my hairline do squiggidy squiggidy at my small age
1390 2018-06-30 20:39:28 This is along with the regular greasing of nipples, bearings and flanges as your boat maintenance DIY jobs. 
You also need to wash your boat regularly - IMHO and check gearbox oil and fan belts.
While this is going on, you spot all of the other bits that need attention.. 
1391 2018-06-30 20:39:24 Trump has declared war against oil companies in the US, first he puts 25% Tariffs on the steel they use for pipelines and drilling rigs and now he’s called on Saudi Arabia to pump more oil so they get lower prices on barrels of oil. He used to say he wanted US oil Independence!
1392 2018-06-30 20:39:11 this oil change is looong over due....I went 17,000 miles since my last oil change 
1393 2018-06-30 20:39:10 He was oil checking dudes earlier he just wanted to taste it or he doing coke numbies
1394 2018-06-30 20:39:08 [takes fish oil pills after lounging in bed doing nothing until 1pm] I’m so responsible!
1395 2018-06-30 20:39:06 Now the midges have landed  Oil!!!
1396 2018-06-30 20:39:00 Sadly accurate 
They are not as concerned because we are the favorite oil supplier.
1397 2018-06-30 20:38:52 Under obama the prices were high due to his policies that restricted oil supply. Now they are high due to increased demand from the growing economy. Obama never had that problem.
1398 2018-06-30 20:38:42 “The oil change man” 
1399 2018-06-30 20:38:34 You’re a snake oil saleswoman, and a fork-tongued liar. We’re disgraced to have you as a representative.
1400 2018-06-30 20:38:34 So these protests are the direct result of State Dept trying to drive Iran's oil exports to zero?
1401 2018-06-30 20:38:29 Would you join a oil company to combat climate change?
1402 2018-06-30 20:38:22 Suggest you keep applying coconut oil to the cut on your palm so it doesn’t dry out & hurt as much when it reopens...because you know it will!
1403 2018-06-30 20:38:20 Alright people who’s covering my base with my deep tanning spray oil I bought today...need someone to get my back 
1404 2018-06-30 20:38:20 I am waiting in my car with my left arm getting burned, to get an oil change.  It's now 20 minutes.  Other two bays have had cars that came after me get serviced.
1405 2018-06-30 20:38:16 Certainly seems like a good idea! BTW loved your out of the box thinking this AM on Cavuto was it? Strategic oil reserve indeed! You are so much more than a pretty face!
1406 2018-06-30 20:38:12 My momma used tea tree oil to fix everything since I was little so I understand but coconut oil don’t get it for me. Now, olive oil?! Underrated queen 
1407 2018-06-30 20:38:10 Why are we not shutting our enemies out (Most 9-11 hijackers from Saudi) and drilling our own oil? Employ American oil workers.
1408 2018-06-30 20:38:09 I don't want to take cbd oil i want to smoke a blunt just like we take pills all the nourishment goes into the mouth
1409 2018-06-30 20:38:07 Why didn’t Arnold mention the outdated internal combustion engine? Oil companies not give him permission?
1410 2018-06-30 20:37:57 Cut in half, toss lightly in olive oil and balsamic, bit of pepper, salt, roast on cookie sheet. #wholenewworld
1411 2018-06-30 20:37:25 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
1412 2018-06-30 20:37:20 I find it weird/suspicious #Trump is advising leaders in another country how much oil to produce; especially when there's companies there owned by him. #CrookedTrump
1413 2018-06-30 20:37:16 War is justified if a country attacks us.  We have a right to defend ourselves.  But we’re bombing 7 Middle East countries.  Most share one thing.

OIL
1414 2018-06-30 20:37:11 So I should eat more steak AND more olive oil? Works for me.
1415 2018-06-30 20:36:51 *too.

How about putting America first and not shipping oil to China? Or allow drilling off Florida’s coast? 

…is what you’d be saying if this was happening under President Obama.
1416 2018-06-30 20:36:48 I would argue the opposite
1417 2018-06-30 20:36:24 week 36 & I’m sooooo uncomfortable & miserable today  now I understand why people take castor oil lol ..
1418 2018-06-30 20:36:23 Maybe if you had not backstabbed Canada we would not have to beg Terrorist King For oil. Grandpa sucks more every day
1419 2018-06-30 20:36:23 who the hell forgot anyone?  The GOP?  They have controlled the government for the last 24 years.

20 or 24 years GOP controlled House
14 of 24 years GOP controlled Senate

What are you talking about?  The GOP are snake oil salesmen and women

1421 2018-06-30 20:36:19 Smoky Mac n Cheese: Add 1/3 handfuls of sliced chicken, 2/3 squirts of bacon bits & 2 oz of fish oil to a bowl. Roast for 45 sec and enjoy!
1422 2018-06-30 20:36:13 Don’t let the kids be a distracting smoke screen. Don’t get sucked in and distracted from imp. Issues like environment, budget, protecting Park’s snd beaches from oil, heads of departments not filled, voter rights, organic standards, immigration costs, SS.

1424 2018-06-30 20:35:39 I live by (pure) tea tree oil I mix it in with nearly everything. But slandering coconut oil is like slandering your elders. It's not cool bro 
1425 2018-06-30 20:35:26 80 million people living under strict Islamic rule for decades because the U.S. didn't get cheap oil from their government. Think about how horrific that actually is
1426 2018-06-30 20:35:17 Everybody's grub their oil changed today....
1427 2018-06-30 20:35:01 Every. Time. Stop oil exploration. Stop believing oil companies.
1428 2018-06-30 20:34:53 Yeah people letting there bears drive cars, jumping into pools of oil, crazy country there.

1431 2018-06-30 20:34:18 the area of the national park is 1,920,000 acres, yes 1.9million acres: the area for oil production will cover precisely 10 acres..
It will located roughly 30 miles from any area where gorillas have their habitat. This a non story.

1436 2018-06-30 20:34:01 She seems to have invested it all in "big oil." 
1437 2018-06-30 20:33:50 With constant cruising, most boats - in my opinion - you should do an oil change 2 or 3 times between each oil filter filter change. 
We never get it hot or fast enough for long enough to keep it sweet #ItalianTuneUp ( second time I've used that today )
1438 2018-06-30 20:33:45 I know the John Deere tractor is up for maintenance. I thought today would be a great day to change the oil. Until I walked outside. 90+ degrees.
1439 2018-06-30 20:33:44 who knows, indeed! think tanks can only create deniers, not good will. i believe fewer lives would be lost if we suddenly put big oil out of business right now, even if half of those that voted them off the island were deniers.
1440 2018-06-30 20:33:19 (( if you can get like a facemask and put peppermint oil in it. When I did housekeeping, it saved me a million times

1442 2018-06-30 20:33:13 does anyone have a tanning oil/ spray they would recommend ?? I want one for when I go on vaca so I can get as tan as possible!

1444 2018-06-30 20:32:52 The raising oil prices are a result of the Iran nuclear deal that caused an over supply and subsequent lack of investment. 3 years of mainly short cycle oil investments could cause long term problems.
1445 2018-06-30 20:32:50 Simple. First defaults/asset deflation and then inflation via oil/other commodities/war will be the answer. It always has been, always will be...
1446 2018-06-30 20:32:47 Saw it done on TV. Going to put a lot of oil on the dough and the grill, cook one side, flip it, put the cheese, etc on, then finish it.
1447 2018-06-30 20:32:44 What happened to being independent from foreign oil ?
1448 2018-06-30 20:32:41 Its crazy to think five guys cooks there french fries in peanut oil 
1449 2018-06-30 20:32:41 Read and learn:
"Below are the 15 countries that exported the highest dollar value worth of crude oil during 2017:

Saudi Arabia: US$133.6 billion (15.9% of total crude oil exports)

Russia: $93.3 billion (11.1%)

Iraq: $61.5 billion (7.3%)

1451 2018-06-30 20:32:17 This is well within the overproduction of quote they always do.  In other words, no big deal.  

The world produces nearly 100,000,000 barrels of oil per day.  200k is a 0.2% increase. On a typical $3.50 it’s less than a penny.
1452 2018-06-30 20:32:09 is this what trump promised saudis in exchange for more oil production????

1459 2018-06-30 20:30:58 what DOES "Prices TO high!" mean?



not to mention, but i shall, you can't unilaterally increase oil production,

#LEGALLY
1460 2018-06-30 20:30:54 He looks a 2nd amendment fan from Kentucky. A classy 2A fan from Tucky, you know who manages the Tire store as opposed to an oil changer
1461 2018-06-30 20:30:44 The only thing which will turn it is when the economic damage kicks in. However problem it's like turning an oil tanker headed for an ice berg. Damage is happening and even an immediate course correction wont fix it.
1462 2018-06-30 20:30:22 "This is just simply not doable," said one senior Saudi oil official. Womp, womp, womp. And NO, the Saudi King DID NOT agree. Why you have to LIE to impress your supporters? #Facepalm #FAIL #WEAK #LiarInChief #BLOWHARD #MORON #RUSSIAGATE #StormyDaniels #KarenMcDougal
1463 2018-06-30 20:30:22 You laugh now, but consider how USA fucks up the land of others by drilling their oil and going to war. When ppl try to flee, USA says no to refugees. Now usa takes over space, and when the planet is fucked by oil drilling, where will the rest of us escape to?

1474 2018-06-30 20:29:29 We didn’t say they voted to ruin the UK. They voted in what they believe to be the UK’s best interests but were misled & manipulated by charlatans, snake oil salesmen and Russia. 
Where is your evidence that they continue to want this? A people’s vote would clear that up for you.

1477 2018-06-30 20:29:10 Don't fall for it, @DanielPinchbeck . Weed was illegalized to stop HEMP OIL. The ALEC corps just planted the ENTIRE STATE of KY - REPLACING TOBACCO AS KY STATE CROP - to start mfr of HEMP OIL. U.S.A. will FEIGN that it's Saudi oil - but it's HEMP OIL they are producing now.
1478 2018-06-30 20:29:04 I’m a moisturising addict. My mother got me into the habit, she’s Anglo-Indian and our skins tend to look ashy if we don’t moisturise. Her father used to oil his skin with mustard oil. My mum is 83 and has beautiful flawless skin.
1479 2018-06-30 20:28:52 Are there foreign companies drilling the oil like Total, BP, Shell, Exxon or is it just national companies of Saudi and UAE? This is an interesting claim. I wish you would write an article.
1480 2018-06-30 20:28:43 So yesterday someone spilt oil on the floor and of course while I was running I had to step on it. I slipped and fell so fucking hard dude
1481 2018-06-30 20:28:32 Here's a hint of olive oil, and THAT, kids, is why god left us.

1483 2018-06-30 20:28:05 So you're laying out your plan to cut taxes to the richest, cut education and healthcare again, be sycophants to the oil industry, and blame teachers and nurses for the inevitable continue oil boom and bust cycles?

1492 2018-06-30 20:26:01 Lots of science involved in the oil industry so not clear on why you think he's a science denier. As I just said the EPA turned into a powerful bureaucracy w/out representation and needs to be significantly shrunk or dismantled. Also why do you think the choice is enviro or corp?

1498 2018-06-30 20:24:42 The reason there has been activity at North Korean nuclear sites is because they’ve been clearing out space to store all our new Saudi oil. Nothing to worry about
1499 2018-06-30 20:24:40 If oil hit $300/bbl we would have wanted US military bases in Iraq so we could invade Iran. Yes, I know that's ruthless, but global population is 7+ billion. If transportation fuel prices go through the roof the misery is brutal and global.

Started using beard oil my wife got me its boss check it out
1511 2018-06-30 20:22:50 So it's a simple recipe. Mayo, sesame oil, soy sauce, and siracha. For a couple cups mayo it'd be a couple teaspoons oil and soy. And you can add the siracha to taste! Or if you prefer Sambal chili paste you can you use that in place of the siracha! Both are good!
1512 2018-06-30 20:22:42 Then let's see them do it and how long they can keep it up. The Saudi fields were overstated. How many years do you think they can keep it up? Why do you think the US wasn't exporting? I believe the oil end game is upon us. The world switches to electric (fusion power)

1520 2018-06-30 20:21:30 Counterpoint: in 2003 every oil expert in the world thought we were looking at $300+/bbl oil. We got really lucky and developed horizontal drilling, hydraulic fraccing, and proppants. But no one had a crystal ball in 2003 to know the US would start gushing oil in 2012.

1529 2018-06-30 20:20:20 As of tomorrow, I’m going to try and do a months worth of oil sketches with my non-dominant left hand. Who knows what the results will be?
1530 2018-06-30 20:20:17 Recently it's "Digitisation", the snake oil of all corporate problems.
1531 2018-06-30 20:20:16 I understand Baslamic Vinegar & Olive Oil but not plain salt.

Grew up eating tomatoes like apples & melon with its pure sweetness.
1532 2018-06-30 20:20:05 I use JBCO, essential oils (lavender, ylang ylang, rosemary, sweet basil), avocado oil and sweet almond oil.
1533 2018-06-30 20:19:51 Venezuela is going through hardships because of Wall Street and oil.  Not socialism.
1534 2018-06-30 20:19:42 Look at iran. They had a successful government, but it didn't bend over backwards for the U.S. &sell them cheap oil. So the CIA planted false news stories about the president about him being a bad Muslim, he was overthrown &the shah put in, which lead to the revolution.
1535 2018-06-30 20:19:41 Went to go get an oil change today and get a diagnostic on my car today. Other probably wouldn't be able to tell but I've felt like my brakes haven't felt the same for a bit. I was right. Need to get my brakes done soon. As well as some other things. #theregoesallmymoney
1536 2018-06-30 20:19:30 Partly due to oil price and mainly Dollar value hike
1537 2018-06-30 20:19:20 I'm just always plaiting it at night.. And keeping it moisturized.. For me personally I feel like coconut oil works best on my hair but there are other natural hair products you can find at most shops that are good. 
1538 2018-06-30 20:19:09 Vlad must have told Don to get the prices up for oil. Russia needs the metro dollars to continue their war in Syria and to fund their defenses as well as support their invasion of Ukraine. Don is such a good boy. A really good boy!
1539 2018-06-30 20:19:08 Hi Ken. Clean the screen thoroughly, most importantly the edges when the screen meets the bezel. An aggressive scrub with cleaner on a q-tip at the bezel will get out the crumbs, skin oil, food truck grease (not judging) that accumulates there and causes the receptor confusion.

1542 2018-06-30 20:19:00 It’s appropriate given that Trump is the most successful snake oil salesmen of all time.
1543 2018-06-30 20:18:43 Went to get my oil changed and then got invited to their mechanics party tonight

and lavender which balances the oil production 
and keeps you looking fresh.
1546 2018-06-30 20:18:32 It is a true assessment Pierre.  They are only interested in regime change at any cost.  It is hard to predict if their actions will lead to regime change or make their regime stronger. Anyways the price of oil will go higher as you have predicted.
1547 2018-06-30 20:18:30 Use castor oil
1548 2018-06-30 20:18:28 Also, you have to remember that their reserves do not equate to the volume produced at the surface.

Oil contracts & gas expands as petroleum is produced due to their compressibility - the ratio used to measure this volume change is called Formation Volume Factor (Bo or Bg).
1549 2018-06-30 20:18:22 Big oil has been funding a lot of think tanks for a very very long time.  Who knows, maybe renewable energy generation will slow the acceleration of our emissions, but there is no "the solution" - there's just going to be hella lotta dying.
1550 2018-06-30 20:18:03 I make my own oil and use that on my scalp. Then braid spray when I have braids in.
1551 2018-06-30 20:17:44 Coffee and cbd oil together are contradictory and the caffeine won

1554 2018-06-30 20:17:15 hmmm I wonder if my little guard gun can mop floors?  I think if yours can do the dishes mine should be able to do the floors for me. I mean, sometime she acts just like a liberal.  I buy all her cleaning oil & bullets, keep her polished & she just lays around in her gun safe

1558 2018-06-30 20:17:01 Slathered myself in coconut oil. 
1559 2018-06-30 20:16:30 Only reason you are saying this instead of believing17Intel agencies is bc you'er setting us up. When you return from mtg w/Putin you will lift all sanctions so you can profit from the billions of barrels of oil produced from Kara Sea. You hv been chomping at the bit to get at it
1560 2018-06-30 20:16:26 Sitting in a room full of essential oil vapor, warm compress on jaw muscles, watching low stakes television programming. Happy Saturday.
1561 2018-06-30 20:16:24 On Saudi Arabia increasing oil production at request of the MOFO: According to Bloomberg, Saudi state media have confirmed a phone call between Trump and King Salman took place, but have not confirmed any agreement on production increases.
1562 2018-06-30 20:16:24 The oil in the mayonnaise would absorb that shit good though lmao.
1563 2018-06-30 20:16:11 Release the nation's emergency oil reserves now.. Also tell people to drive less.. OK for work or medical reasons..  No more joy riding.
1564 2018-06-30 20:16:06 Yes... 2 major reasons.
1.. International oil destabilizing condition.
2... Pakistani Govt are not ready to give subsidy on oil prices
1565 2018-06-30 20:16:06 just paid $122 for an oil change, i'm doing this shit myself from now on 
1566 2018-06-30 20:16:03 I know that, but Nepal is a small country with minimum consumption of oil, and it’s also mentioned here ‘GDP’.. that’s sounds impossible
1567 2018-06-30 20:15:48 We have the solutions. Big oil companies put a halt to them. Maybe be could talk them into being partners into engines that run on water. There needs to be a common ground for the good of the people. (Keeping prices down!)
1568 2018-06-30 20:15:48 I should prob call that cat to change my oil tbh
1569 2018-06-30 20:15:43 How about the Saudis refuting trumps claim about increased oil production to lower costs? That one takes the cake 
1570 2018-06-30 20:15:29 Regardless of today'a result, Uruguay is the better side

Yeah. It's all President Obama's fault.

Tell me. When you don't gas your car up or change the oil or rotate tires, is it President Obama's fault when your car fails?
1580 2018-06-30 20:14:40 What does one off 2mbbl/d of oil represent? More or less the amount of solar and wind that is added every year in the world (taking into account eff. of engines).  Bearish oil maybe ? Bullish oil maybe? Screwing OPEC sure. 
In the grand scheme of things for energy : meaningless

1587 2018-06-30 20:13:58 If Putin had agenda before Trump elected, it would have been: Weaken Nato, weaken EU, weaken WTO, weaken US influence globally, stir up discord in Europe by fomenting immigration concern/populism. Distract from Crimea, and MH17/Ukraine. Oil price up.

1591 2018-06-30 20:13:36 Trump already made a deal with the Saudi Prince to trim production and raise oil $, buoyed by reneging on the Iran nuke deal.

Saudi want to close its deficit.

Putin wants higher prices for more petrodollars.

Obama, Saudis in 2014 raised production to restrict $ flow to Russia

1603 2018-06-30 20:11:32 I am not an oil expert (at all, in fact rather a novice), but from reading over the years it always seems to me that 10MM boepd was the sustainable maximum, and that it was gradually declining (mostly because of Ghawar plateauing at best)
1604 2018-06-30 20:11:28 And what about the taxes that are imposed on oil.

1613 2018-06-30 20:10:47 No racing for us tonight.  Car is mostly back together. We have a couple fenders and good to make and we will be good to go for Thursday at Lucas Oil Speedway!
1614 2018-06-30 20:10:45 Not so much OUR dependence on foreign oil, but that the international market price for oil is driven by foreign considerations. And THAT drives our prices.

1624 2018-06-30 20:09:30 Having your hair up causes lots of tension and the weight of it does put more pressure on your scalp. Wear your hair down whenever you can and castor oil does wonders for the scalp! Don't forget to give yourself scalp massages to stimulate growth! 
1625 2018-06-30 20:08:58 My skin produces so much oil a fast food company stockroom doesnt even compare
1626 2018-06-30 20:08:53 couldn’t find the olive oil so i guess it’s m&ms and red bull for dinner again
1627 2018-06-30 20:08:48 My question would be, is it 100% organic? If no then don't use it again & see if you can get a refund on it, if yes, then it contains to much tea tree oil in it. I use plain coconut oil as a makeup remover & then use a special organic toner & lotion for my face. No issues now.
1628 2018-06-30 20:08:44 and in a year or so oil will go 120$ who will they blame then?

- 

President Donald Trump asked King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia to increase crude oil production to put downward pressure on prices and alleviate some pain at the gas pumps.

Source link 
-...
1631 2018-06-30 20:08:32 Liar-that would break OPEC rules.  Saudi Arabia has  refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.
1632 2018-06-30 20:08:02 Is this going to be the reason trump & GOP sold out the US - stocks in mining or oil or some other Russian industry? Were they offered some prime real estate? Is our democracy worth so little they'd dismantle it to enrich themselves?
1633 2018-06-30 20:08:02 John malkovich is doin everything he can to save deepwater pissed oil all over the gulf and we cared for about 3 months horizon
1634 2018-06-30 20:08:02 Dear @akgop so the President now wants Saudi Arabia to increase oil production which would lower the PPB & further the Alaska fiscal crisis & cost more Alaskans jobs. I thought conservatives believed in free markets. Oh well.
1635 2018-06-30 20:07:52 All I’m saying is they sprayed the pitch in olive oil before the game.
1636 2018-06-30 20:07:41 - rub your legs again! It's a second coat to get even softer.
- rinse. You can use a mild soap to get some of the oil of.
- Lotion your legs up and feel the softness!
1637 2018-06-30 20:07:36 I’m too scared to go too long without an oil change bc of my past experience with my first car 
1638 2018-06-30 20:06:42 YES!! Tinted prime time, mineral veil, barePro liquid foundation and stick concealer, complexion rescue, gen nude blushes, and allll the skincare but especially oil obsessed, pure plush, and skinlongevity. 
1639 2018-06-30 20:06:14 Any specific place I should get the oil from? And do I just massage in the scalp?
1640 2018-06-30 20:05:52 Let’s say the dogs ass was a Democrat. The dog is saying his ass ( the Democrat) was the only thing that got that nasty Republican taste out of it mouth. Like an orange slice after cod live oil.  See how that works? Simple.
1641 2018-06-30 20:05:48 Because the Word Cup is still the most watched football tournament and in international footy you can’t just buy a team, you’re forced to play with lesser talents. It’s why oil state nations won’t ever win the World Cup.
1642 2018-06-30 20:05:47 Buddy, I see people eating out of the trash here in the US too. 

It’s almost like the mismanaged state fucked over the Venezuelan economy(oil ain’t forever) but despite what the propaganda tells you, socialism isn’t the state.
1643 2018-06-30 20:05:35 Can you explain to me whether Iran's current turmoil can be reduced to its oil production? Iran has been experiencing turmoil in various spheres of economy & such economic turmoil predates Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA. I didn't say Iran Protests gave rise to turmoil. (cont.)
1644 2018-06-30 20:05:26 This is called "a rock and a hard place".

Oil price high = angry voters, enriched enemies, alt energy migration.

Oil price low = shale bankruptcies, Putin angry, climate angry.

When this price spread reaches zero, things get really interesting.
1645 2018-06-30 20:05:05 Definitely. Try a mix of peppermint , tea tree and JAMACIAN BLACK CASTOR oil at night to stimulate growth

1650 2018-06-30 20:04:06 Check who cut vets benefits and services. Check REAL stats for deaths robberies rapes murders committed by people in US.

1659 2018-06-30 20:02:59 Prices are relatively low and discovery is obscenely expensive. Not much need for discovery with oil sands in abundance. There's nothing wrong with renewables, but that doesn't mean that my tax dollars need to subsidize them. 
Prices reflect market conditions. Let them fight.

1665 2018-06-30 20:02:28 @elicrafra @XT_coconut_oil can we get real food
1666 2018-06-30 20:02:24 I’m sure they are in there!! Did you know they make their popcorn in Hawaii with coconut oil? It’s divine!!
1667 2018-06-30 20:02:15 For those who like to shit on Messi for not being good enough, he was far better than Ronaldo in today's win or go home matches. With that said, the both have the same issue. #WorldCup
1668 2018-06-30 20:02:08 Sure thing! Also, if you have issues with it being too sticky on your hands and want to avoid more flour, a little bit of olive oil rubbed all over your hands will take care of that too
1669 2018-06-30 20:01:50 Can you explain exactly how the Iran Protests have impacted Iran's oil output and the effect on global oil prices? Trump's tweet is a blatant attempt to divert from the fact that his push to zero-out Iran's oil exports is expected to have a major impact on global supply...
1670 2018-06-30 20:01:39 Biggest reason I cut streams short is because I’m always in pain. CBD oil gummies help immensely.

1672 2018-06-30 20:01:34 Is India Preparing To Cut Oil Imports From Iran?...

1674 2018-06-30 20:01:32 Denuclearization, more oil from Saudi Arabia, just @POTUS lies as usual.  Take note Trumpers.

1677 2018-06-30 20:01:13 Russian Oil Well collateral?
1678 2018-06-30 20:01:12 remember folks the united states gave Japan all the oil it needed to massacre the Koreans and Chinese and didn't bat an eye until Japan took away America's largest holding in the East (the Philippines)
1679 2018-06-30 20:00:53 Ororo no b crude oil 
1680 2018-06-30 20:00:52 Was it not this Uruguayan team that eliminated Ghana from the world cup some years back...
N now they rally behind them like we are into some serious oil business together...Does Messi's  exit warrants Ronaldo's exit too...
#lawsofgh#
Eny3 easy..
Mu de bibiara y3 politics ampa..
1681 2018-06-30 20:00:33 It's a "static" decline curve. I stop all new wells 1 year back to discover the base decline rate. Getting "legacy" production from EIA drilling productivity report? I've never been able to make any sense of that information. It's pure hype. Rigs don't produce oil.
1682 2018-06-30 20:00:31 I mixed raw Shea butter and olive oil together and y'all omgggg
1683 2018-06-30 20:00:25 Quick question,

Does Jamaican Oil work better than Jojoba Oil or they are one thing??

Also, purpose, to grow hair or to just  nurture it ??

Recommendations??

1684 2018-06-30 20:00:23 Fam i don't put random shit on my hair where do you get the oil in Canada tho
1685 2018-06-30 20:00:03 End the drug war like Portugal using treatment not jail & revive the economy on main street, save the environment, and end global dependence on oil (and, by extension, oil wars) with a green/environmental new deal
1686 2018-06-30 19:59:51 Thoughts on giving away an traditional oil painting portrait?
Yay/Nay?
1687 2018-06-30 19:59:42 Harrowing accounts but most of all transparency as the public want and expect ...all in chronological order from the very start..it ain’t over yet.   Ignore QC Khan , he’s a snake oil salesman 
1688 2018-06-30 19:59:40 Neutrogena Body Oil. 
1689 2018-06-30 19:59:35 They are desperate to get their hands on that oil.
1690 2018-06-30 19:59:21 Castor oil
1691 2018-06-30 19:59:01 Nice one, I guess that's oil on canvas?
1692 2018-06-30 19:58:33 honestly the magic of oil
1693 2018-06-30 19:58:26 - castor oil           - milk 
- coconut oil
- olive oil 
- onion juice 
- egg yolk 
- fenugreek seeds 
- aloe vera 
- lemon
1694 2018-06-30 19:58:22 A shame I can’t buy a beer and drink one in Walmart 

This wouldn’t be a problem if I was born and raised in Germany and so happened to have an oil change in Walmart
1695 2018-06-30 19:58:22 A slap at the petroleum industry? Probably would be a good way to hurt "Big Oil."
1696 2018-06-30 19:58:20 I fucking hate trolls, I really do. I wish I could just take someone's words as their genuine position/experience, but charlatans these days are no longer confined to traveling around selling snake oil at carnivals :(
1697 2018-06-30 19:58:20 Yo so what if oil really became obsolete
1698 2018-06-30 19:58:06 Groundnut oil
1699 2018-06-30 19:58:01 What you'll need:
- 1 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup of oil (any type of oil, coconut, olive)
- 3 tablespoon citrus (lemon, lime)
- 1-2 razors
1700 2018-06-30 19:57:58 It is Im actually glad Oilers dont have cap space to waste the best free agent signings are almost always the depth guys with something to prove
1701 2018-06-30 19:57:58 That is why I only recommend @TheCarrickInst Trained functional neurologists @DrFRCarrick is The Godfather, responsible 4 coining the term functional neurologist. Beware of any1 that calls themselves a functional neurologist but aren’t #CarrickTrained many r snake oil salesmen
1702 2018-06-30 19:57:50 Peeps these days
1703 2018-06-30 19:57:39 No.  I’m just trying to inform you.  Neither party gives a about us.  They’re bribed by the MIC, Wall Street, big oil, health ins co’s, etc.

Would you rather your taxes go 4 health care, ed, infrastructure, investing in green jobs or 4 tax cuts for corp, wars & 1%?

Be honest.

1705 2018-06-30 19:57:29 Oil prices especially Petrol price is not at all hurt us! Mostly middle class or upper class own car and little price rise didn’t matter! The inflation is more important and that under control! We will be with @narendramodi ji again and again!
1706 2018-06-30 19:57:28 Al-Morsi brigade--death secrecy: All commanding officers, staff officers and Western-region revolutionaries are ready to move towards the oil crescent to liberate it from the Egyptian-Emirati colonial forces, which have been robbed of Liben 's power.
1707 2018-06-30 19:57:01 FYI crude oil price have taken a $10 per barrel hike in the international market just in the month of June. Unfortunately PMLN can't manufacture oil, it has to be imported.
1708 2018-06-30 19:57:00 why is it so hard for me to find a cleansing oil lmao
1709 2018-06-30 19:56:54 Were you able to negotiate a future free oil change and new windshield wipers an exchange for paying for the most expensive oil change today? #NewMath
1710 2018-06-30 19:56:41 Ewwwwww it a ugly dog
1711 2018-06-30 19:56:40 Ronaldo , Messi say goodbye to Russia on the same day. What a day of football  #Russia2018 #WorldCup #Messi #Ronaldo
1712 2018-06-30 19:56:22 ...energy production giving us independence from foreign oil, regulations to try and fix the economic situation that led to the recession, minority rights, the list goes on and on.
1713 2018-06-30 19:56:21 Indeed, we make many users out of oil by-products. It has transformed our society, oil continues to be important as well. Speaking of power transmission eventually we will have local micro production reducing the need for dependents on transmission. Solar backed by NG generation.

1719 2018-06-30 19:56:02 The king is out,You fought q good fight king Ronaldo ,you're the greatest  player ever.
1720 2018-06-30 19:56:00 Slacking on the castor oil 
1721 2018-06-30 19:55:46 You mean the economic collapse that happened because the government had all their money in oil only, and then the price of oil took a sharp nosedive in the midst of a global economic crisis? The bit where it had nothing to do with socialism, actually it was capitalist BS?
1722 2018-06-30 19:55:42 Oml look at that ugly dog ㅋㅋㅋ
1723 2018-06-30 19:55:17 or fix this morning's oil tweet.
"prices to high"
1724 2018-06-30 19:54:58 Not that simple. Discovery is at an 80 year low. Mostly tight oil at that.
Most oil from a few ME fields that are past prime.
Even big oil is getting into renewables. Cost of production will rise before fields dry. The economics will change commerce long before depletion. Ready?
1725 2018-06-30 19:54:57 A teaspoon of sugar and a dash of baby/olive oil does the same thing and is safe to the enviroment

1730 2018-06-30 19:54:19 try mixing it with a vitamin e oil
1731 2018-06-30 19:53:39 It does sound like they're generalizing now that I think about it.

"Try this wholisitic miracle snake oil! It will cure your kidney stones!"
1732 2018-06-30 19:53:37 All of a sudden I want to make a giant abstract oil painting and sell it for 2000 dollars
1733 2018-06-30 19:53:36 But it was another lie. OPEC needs to make the decision and they want oil prices hig.
1734 2018-06-30 19:53:11 Them muss have oil pan dem knee
1735 2018-06-30 19:52:58 More important is that he leaves out that his "pal" Prince Salman and his "pal" Vlad were the two parties squeezing production to raise the price of their oil, but before the meeting with Putin, Trump needs the price to come down. After, haha.
1736 2018-06-30 19:52:52 someone bring me some frying oil and a pack of thin cut chicken breasts . ill make my own fucking katsu
1737 2018-06-30 19:52:46 Whole flax seeds contain both the fiber + oil, giving you all the nutritional value in one. Add 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to a Green Smoothie!

1742 2018-06-30 19:52:34 What kind of oil do you get?
1743 2018-06-30 19:52:30 Malcolm Trumps forming an alliance with oil producing countries who play ball. Time to go after our oil co. For aiding and abedding a known felon. Along with banks and financiers.
1744 2018-06-30 19:52:18 Yo I was use to going in the supermarket smelling a couple of lotion bottles and choosing the best  one where do you get your coconut oil tho?
1745 2018-06-30 19:52:02 The health ranger, is heartless money grubbing snake oil salesman. He targets the gullable and those easily impressed by his evidence free babble. Unfortunately, in the end Darwin will have his say.

1748 2018-06-30 19:51:46 Disfunction in *Iran*s's oil supply? Is he saying that because he's telling people not to buy Iranian oil that it's Iran's fault?  And it's not like VZ's kleptostate has been an effective oil producer for years, as the GOP's been telling us all along.
1749 2018-06-30 19:51:44 Lmao brought my truck for an oil change and a guy walked in with an ice pack on his forehead and said “hell nah this shit melting already” 
1750 2018-06-30 19:51:42 Yeah, Gas Stations usually wait another month after the oil $ drops before they drop gas $ ... But of course AS SOON AS the oil $ goes UP, they raise the gas $ at the pumps.
But once the 'petrodollar' collapses, it's all moot anyway.
1751 2018-06-30 19:51:36 Free oil changes for life. But thanks
1752 2018-06-30 19:51:35 me yesterday tbh. i got a hot oil treatment from lush and am a bit less fluff today.
1753 2018-06-30 19:51:34 I put baby oil on instead of lotion and now my body out here getting fried.
1754 2018-06-30 19:51:19 I think that in every protest picture or video I’ve seen to date featuring anti-hydrocarbon protesters, nearly every thing they’re wearing or using is sourced from gas/oil. From gore-Tex jackets, to plastic kayaks. Then there is power transmission....ever been to a copper mine ??
1755 2018-06-30 19:51:10 Oh the wait for a oil change. 3+ hours at Wallisville @Walmart I understand it’s the Holliday next week but come on!
1756 2018-06-30 19:50:59 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1757 2018-06-30 19:50:46 hey boys, have heard about Nuveen making a sun block lotian with canibis oil. They call it SPF 420 !
1758 2018-06-30 19:50:43 Let me get some oil
1759 2018-06-30 19:50:33 Yessss CBD oil >>>>
1760 2018-06-30 19:50:32 Because they're rich and control the flow of oil, the US doesn't really have economic independence and we lost manufacturing a long time ago. We should start producing our own or switch to other sources so that the Saudis can find someone else to sell their crap to.
1761 2018-06-30 19:50:20 Oil + alcohol: is a hassle but it works
1762 2018-06-30 19:50:17 Fellow kings, make sure you put castor oil on the beard today. The sun is shining today, so shall we
1763 2018-06-30 19:50:01 Boom. Oil is going home
1764 2018-06-30 19:49:59 Is there butter on the field or like oil ??
1765 2018-06-30 19:49:52 You mean like inventing a rule, then pretending we don't all remember? 
You made the #McConnellRule. Now you have to stand by it. 
Or admit that you have the morals and character of a snake oil salesman.

1766 2018-06-30 19:49:50 Ricin (/ˈraɪsɪn/ RY-sin), a lectin (a carbohydrate-binding protein) produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis, is a highly potent toxin. A dose of purified ricin powder the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human.
1767 2018-06-30 19:49:14 What is up with this grass? Did the groundskeepers spray oil all over it instead of water?
1768 2018-06-30 19:49:08 Someone poured crude oil on this pitch #URUPOR
1769 2018-06-30 19:49:06 They have made a real change! They empowered the gangs to control the area for several years and allowed them to control public funds and choose the candidates for the last election. This changed the entire landscape of the area.

＼It's OIL!!!／
1771 2018-06-30 19:49:02 Great post if... it wasn't so dishonest! BP spilled 136,000 litres of toxic mud off the coast of Nova Scotia during an exploratory test. This after your gov't approved BP to drill seven of the deepest offshore oil wells ever! Don't doublespeak!
1772 2018-06-30 19:48:54 I've had some baked peppers that have a small amount of anchovy paste mixed in w/ garlic & olive oil, and that is great. But if I see an actual anchovy...
1773 2018-06-30 19:48:53 Question: Will Trump realize some day that he can’t have a total blockade on Iranian oil? Or will he just keep tweeting at the Saudis as the oil price climbs ever higher?
1774 2018-06-30 19:48:51 I remember, when our own government blew up 7 buildings, blamed it on arabs, started a war to drive up oil prices, and rob Americans of their treasury and promised freedoms traded for false security and safety. Got it. That 9/11 ? Come on Laura I know you know the truth, right?
1775 2018-06-30 19:48:45 The money were  loot from oil sales yet no Niger Deltan states will benefit from it.
Very funny...
1776 2018-06-30 19:48:39 I don't post what i don't verify sir.
1777 2018-06-30 19:48:31 Is the pitch covered in oil? So many players losing their footing in midfield.
1778 2018-06-30 19:48:31 I thought we were on our way to energy dependence with US oil reserves and natural gas.  Is there an associated timeline?

1780 2018-06-30 19:47:59 They used to put pink dye in it. They dropped the dye years ago but kept the name. It's made in BC. Co-op and London drugs is where I usually get it. But twice a year they have giant tubs and buckets at Costco. It's made with coconut oil an enzyme from seaweed and baking soda.
1781 2018-06-30 19:47:57 The collapse of Iran’s Islamic regime “is around the corner,” and the U.S. will keep increasing sanctions until it happens, President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani told an exiled Iranian opposition group

1784 2018-06-30 19:47:28 i'm speaking about this from a black man perspective. i see people selling beard oil and beard maintenance stuff on every corner and even on campus (i go to a pwi)
1785 2018-06-30 19:47:18 I am genuinely worried that Torriera has been so good, that one of the the oil teams might now realise how good he is and blow us out of the water.
He has been excellent up against Ronaldo.
1786 2018-06-30 19:46:58 Ahh yes American "democracy " where corporations buy politicians and try to get whatever laws they want passed. Go ask Nestle why the water in Flint Michigan hasn't been fixed yet. Or how oil companies knew the risks of global warming but hid it from the public
1787 2018-06-30 19:46:48 Someone once said that data is the new oil ,#bigdata talks . its time for it to become scarce b4 we even state mining, #socialmedia Analysis
1788 2018-06-30 19:46:47 You nail it Tammy! We could produce enough oil and nat. gas for the US alone for another 400 years. By then, we will either be extinct or there will be different energy available!
1789 2018-06-30 19:46:45 I use cbd oil for my dogs epilepsy. This law should allow the use for this purpose

1799 2018-06-30 19:45:26 Was there talk of Macedonia joining the Russian Federation? Or Montenegro? Albania? Turkey perhaps?
All recipients of structural funds... not Scotland, the largest oil producer in the EU... we're unwelcome of course.

1810 2018-06-30 19:44:09 So obama bows to a Saudi king and we get nothing, Saudi king bows to trump and Saudi Arabia increases oil output at trumps request to help bring gas prices down...

1812 2018-06-30 19:43:46 KSA and other Arab state should increase the supply of crude oil to bring the souring prices down to affordable level. @KingSalman @HHShkMohd @KingAbdullahII @realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau @EmmanuelMacron @theresa_may @Queen_Europe @thepmo @PutinRF_Eng @SenSanders @Pontifex
1813 2018-06-30 19:43:46 imperial is better for cooking since it goes by volume and not weight. a cup of water, sugar, oil, peanut butter, etc is a cup. if you go by grams you have to get out a scale because those all weight differently.
1814 2018-06-30 19:43:41 Right ! I always mix my lotion and baby oil 
1815 2018-06-30 19:43:41 It is the official position of the editorial desk at 222 minutes that only the following should ever be put on a beef steak:

Salt
Pepper
Olive Oil

Furthermore, said steak shall never be cooked past medium rare.

Anyone who says differently is fake news.
1816 2018-06-30 19:43:27 My parents: Here's another movie trailer about the dairy industry, oh also your oil free salt free vegetable meal is on the stove
Me: *drinking salad dressing* what
1817 2018-06-30 19:43:11 So you don’t want us to use more American oil?
1818 2018-06-30 19:43:06 I doubt the King of Saudi Arabia has much to do with setting oil production quotas. You would have thought the King of America would have known that.
1819 2018-06-30 19:43:05 10-30 engine oil is good. Berts can tell u how much u need. Probably 4 bottles
1820 2018-06-30 19:43:03 Marginal cost of oil exploitation is very low in Saudi Arabia compared to other oil producing countries
1821 2018-06-30 19:43:02 Yeah like mixing oil and water
1822 2018-06-30 19:43:00 You are a snake oil salesmen, but you definitely got scammed by KJU.  Go ahead and deny again, no one believes you. You have no credibility.
1823 2018-06-30 19:42:56 What, no increased tariff imposition on importing oil into the USA to protect indigenous American oil workers? My word.
1824 2018-06-30 19:42:53 I’ll get sum oil for you when it dry up, it’s all love this side Danni, I’ll support your body if you won’t 
1825 2018-06-30 19:42:52 "Produce" more??? "produce"?? "PRODUCE"??? "More"?? Is oil manufactured?
1826 2018-06-30 19:42:47 vin has oil
1827 2018-06-30 19:42:45 For a lamp to keep burning, One needs to continue to put oil in it.
1828 2018-06-30 19:42:38 Only when we have managed to destroy all of the natural world will we realise the loss. Someone [would like to know which company] is going to drill for oil in the sensitive area's in the Congo... you know, where the Gorillas live.. Our legacy is truly terrible!
1829 2018-06-30 19:42:28 I need a oil change
1830 2018-06-30 19:42:27 Soon enough Saudi Arabia won't have any oil
1831 2018-06-30 19:42:24 I'll read it after d match,but we must verify because we don't like people issuing statements and attributing to him
1832 2018-06-30 19:42:04 READ YOUR BOOKS MAN. OIL WILL CEASE TO EXIST WITHIN 40 YEARS. YOURE DRAININ IT BRO
1833 2018-06-30 19:41:55 It would have nice, for those of us who trade oil and oil stocks, to have your substantive take. But it’s your twitter feed, so thanks for that spelling lesson.
1834 2018-06-30 19:41:33 U.S. imports of #Venezuela crude oil jumped to a 9-month high in April, according to @EIAgov, two months after then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Trump administration could ban crude imports from the nation.

1835 2018-06-30 19:41:21 In the 70's Asians moved into N Dallas and began a large presence. In the 80' s I believe North Dallas Mosque was built a block away and Muslims came. In neither case do I remember life changing in any measurable way.
1836 2018-06-30 19:41:12 What is palm oil mainely used for ?
1837 2018-06-30 19:40:58 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1838 2018-06-30 19:40:54 Will you be at @RaceSelinsgrove next Sunday?
1839 2018-06-30 19:40:47 Ahem, I literally dunno how hard it is to not get oil all over the stove coils every time???? Somehow I? manage not to? Not every time? But that’s just like? Not for other people?
1840 2018-06-30 19:40:37 White racists have been whitewashing the history of the Southern traitor's butchery, racism, and slavery for years. Pun intended. 

That's why they're suckers for snake oil shills like Dinesh the felon Dsousa.
1841 2018-06-30 19:40:34 Waiting on an oil change for the next 15 minutes. Hit me up with any salary cap questions you have in advance of tonight’s events, and I’ll try to answer them.

1843 2018-06-30 19:40:30 Now that the instability he created has caused higher oil prices, they are more than happy to. If he stayed in the Iran agreement, they'd pump it out and give our so called friends from Saudi Arabia "gas pains"
1844 2018-06-30 19:40:27 …ぐぅ
1845 2018-06-30 19:40:26 Yes, Trump going take ALL of the Iranian oil off the market and Saudi said they are going to make up the difference, excellent Trump!
1846 2018-06-30 19:40:26 Get someone to rub it with warm scented oil for you
1847 2018-06-30 19:40:24 Is he paid in Oil !

1857 2018-06-30 19:38:18 I just made zucchini chips. Well, they are in the oven. I am roasting them with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. They smell amazing.
1858 2018-06-30 19:38:00 My mind dey tell me say Ronaldo go equalize
1859 2018-06-30 19:37:54 What about the no boiling kn oil crisis?
1860 2018-06-30 19:37:34 You shouldn’t wear baby oil in the sun.
1861 2018-06-30 19:37:32 Um, the actual headline should be, "Saudi King agrees to increase oil production after Trump direct request" but no, no, you gotta leave out the part about how he agreed, because that makes Trump look good.
1862 2018-06-30 19:37:26 Oil cap? Air hockey puck? Jar opener?

1864 2018-06-30 19:37:11 India import huge quantity of crude (unrefined) oil then refine it to consume in country and export surplus refine oil.
1865 2018-06-30 19:37:04 Putin is just fine with oil @$74. I have doubts this is what happened. He could threaten to release SPR but he’s too busy talking up coal.
1866 2018-06-30 19:36:53 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @Xtreme365R
1867 2018-06-30 19:36:41 I thought that. I took the oil pump drive shaft out and spun up the oil pump. And it pumped the oil through the lifters in the bottom half of the motor. This is what has me stumped. O.0
1868 2018-06-30 19:36:31 But I get you though. There are tons of lives that are actual lives that need tons of help right now. But we place animals/oil/ and money as our priorities
1869 2018-06-30 19:36:30 Sitting in the heat waiting to get my oil changed is not what i wanted to do this afternoon but..I'm the procrastination queen, so here I sit 
1870 2018-06-30 19:36:27 We got Pioneer Nuggets oil wax back in, and 25% off... What a deal... Hopefully a deal you cant pass up. Only nine more hours of the sale :)
1871 2018-06-30 19:36:17 Recommend red wine vinegar, olive oil based marinate. Salt it up. Soy sauce was just your sodium vehicle.
1872 2018-06-30 19:36:10 So I’ve been having trouble sleeping at night and my Filipino grandma has been putting oil on my chest and behind my ears before going to sleep. SHE JUST TOLD MY MOM SHE HAS BEEN PUTTING CBD OIL ON ME. BRUH, I THOUGHT IT WAS COCONUT OIL SHE GOT BLESSED ON EASTER.
1873 2018-06-30 19:35:54 It’s a mix of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs and spices mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise or another oil bruh
1874 2018-06-30 19:35:52 I just went outside to do a half-hour-long chore

I am now drenched in sweat, dizzy, hot, exhausted, and in pain

all I was doing was sprinkling adsorbent to suck up motor oil drips, then sweeping it back up

I hate the Southern US' weather
1875 2018-06-30 19:35:50 I’m so confused why you would be turning your blinker on for an oil change
1876 2018-06-30 19:35:40 I put very little faith in oil industry hacks to accurately predict the ensuing decade of geopolitics, and have exactly no idea why anyone would. Attention-grabby predictions based on some relatively quiet but (admittedly) large changes in the energy are a great way to sell books
1877 2018-06-30 19:35:28 I'll tell you why. My boy @L0WTIERGOD is always burning the midnight oil, hitting the gym to consistently keeping his body in true form.
1878 2018-06-30 19:35:23 America was on the path to decreaing foreign oil consumption in its efforts to be energy independent and use less fossil fuels and more renewable energy sources. US dependence on oil hit 30yr low in 2016. Oil consumption is directly attributable to toxic air contamination.
1879 2018-06-30 19:35:20 MAGA: making American oil industry great again.
1880 2018-06-30 19:35:17 Apologies that our league isn’t run by oil money and tourists bud, with the exclusion of maybe Liverpool and Crystal Palace the PL is dead atmosphere-wise.
1881 2018-06-30 19:35:12 There is one large orange, two lemons... Thyme, garlic, rosemary from my yard, bought some sage. Placed it all on a bed of baby carrots (to absorb the drippings)... Better pull it out of the oven and dribble olive oil.
1882 2018-06-30 19:34:54 Olive oil, chopped garlic, poultry seasoning S & P ... apple cider vinegar, olive oil, water and whatever seasonings for steak
1883 2018-06-30 19:34:49 There’s still a sea separating it, which we’ve found oil and gas in! Thank you for that  Maybe when we’ve extracted it all you can have the Falklands back haha
1884 2018-06-30 19:34:47 Oh yes. I soaked em good with oil.
1885 2018-06-30 19:34:46 Ooh baby! Cut it into strips, fry in oil, and dip in BBQ sauce!

1889 2018-06-30 19:34:38 Countries like #SaudiArabia and #Oman just don't have a bright future in Gasoline usage.

No wonder why some oil companies are dispersing misinformation about @Tesla!

There's always a corporate politics of greed to ruin @elonmusk's car company!

1890 2018-06-30 19:34:27 You are not the first to ask, "Why this waste?" 
A woman once poured expensive oil out on Jesus: "..And they criticized her sharply. But Jesus said, 'Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me.'" Mark 14:5-6
The souls that are being saved are worth it!
1891 2018-06-30 19:34:26 That pitch is mad slippery

1894 2018-06-30 19:33:48 I could rob someone with cooking oil thats how hot it is rn....
1895 2018-06-30 19:33:45 I’m putting on ONE layer of lotion, no baby oil
1896 2018-06-30 19:33:43 I don’t know how porn stars do it bc I’m covered in tanning oil but also I’m covered in grass, dirt, and sweat and that is not attractive.
1897 2018-06-30 19:33:42 Considering a large percentage of oil comes from Canada that we are in a trade war with...
1898 2018-06-30 19:33:42 PDF/E > Fuel oil > ISO 14000 > Aerospace industry > Leisure industry > Chemical industry > Turpentine > Gutta-percha > Fragaria vesca > Elk
1899 2018-06-30 19:33:35 It’s raw coconut oil but because of the temp in my room is was slick melting so imhad she waisted it 
1900 2018-06-30 19:33:11 KSA is a responsible state & committed towards the stability of intn'l economic & don't forget USA is among the highest oil producers. However production increase has already announced by OPEC members including Iran and others awa Russia
1901 2018-06-30 19:32:57 Where?
1902 2018-06-30 19:32:56 今日はお話ありがとうございました！お気をつけてお帰りくださいー！
1903 2018-06-30 19:32:50 I have to when they refill the oil. 
1904 2018-06-30 19:32:29 Hooked on that foreign oil eyh???
1905 2018-06-30 19:32:12 Who owns the oil company?
1906 2018-06-30 19:32:01 Saudi oil fields are drying up.  They need to pump in water to get the oil to rise.  Fossils are dead energy.   Solar, wind hydro are live energy.  Time to go live.
1907 2018-06-30 19:31:49 ... You will need all that oil. Prices for foreign cars will go up due to your trade war. Means everybody will buy US cars with technology from the 80s and 90s.
..but wait, 2 weeks ago you said that the US should become independent from oil imports. Hmmpf...
1908 2018-06-30 19:31:48 Apparently the driver was out of the driver seat checking  the oil spillage when the tanker rolled back , smashed some fifty cars. I pray for Gods peace for the families.
1909 2018-06-30 19:31:39 Soon....
1910 2018-06-30 19:31:32 Ended up not going hiking because weather looked crappy. But I made oil blends for my cousin,  cleaned, and threw away my broken dresser.
1911 2018-06-30 19:31:26 America doesn't use either country's oil
1912 2018-06-30 19:31:24 According to my husband who was just in a meeting the OPEC nations area going to pt a very high tariff on our oil...
1913 2018-06-30 19:31:17 Coconut oil¿
1914 2018-06-30 19:31:00 There you go telling lies again! 

There was no confirmation that Saudi Arabia would increase oil production, as President Trump said.
1915 2018-06-30 19:30:51 Oil change, Carwash, and a haircut! That’s how you do a Saturday!
1916 2018-06-30 19:30:42 This is what will follow of the tradegies we see rocking in Nigeria something needs to be done now rather than later to avert feature conflicts that will haunt us all in our oil endevours.
1917 2018-06-30 19:30:34 With limited water supply. @realDonaldTrump convincing Saudis to increase oil production over Irans rebuttle? Iranians are getting squeezed. There will be an uprising, they are starting to suffer and it will get worse. Need to keep an eye on Iran, right now.
1918 2018-06-30 19:30:12 Oil painting. I showed a pic of my latest painting to a colleague I'm visiting in Vienna last night. He looked at me and said, "Why are you are you still sitting behind a computer?"
1919 2018-06-30 19:30:07 I am pretty sure he meant to say I’m too high because we never really talked about them producing more oil
1920 2018-06-30 19:30:04 The most stable fats under heat are Saturated Fats.  Lard and Beef Tallow were used almost exclusively in the past, not to mention Coconut Oil. Unsaturated fats oxidize quickly and become unhealthy when heated.
1921 2018-06-30 19:30:03 No, we’re just gonna fashion an industrial sized oil container into a swear jar ;)
1922 2018-06-30 19:30:02 "Triple-digit oil?  Really."
1923 2018-06-30 19:30:01 Moody's says 70% chance #Venezuela's @NicolasMaduro completes term
• Expects economic contraction until mid-2020 & oil production dropping to 500,000 bpd
• If he leaves office, GDP could grow at double-digit rates in first two years, boosting growth in Colombia, Peru and Chile
1924 2018-06-30 19:30:00 Mexican government nationalized oil industry, took massive loans that exposed the economy to huge risks, then the economy got hit really badly.

And now you're claiming it's anarchy?
1925 2018-06-30 19:29:56 I just voted! I love your polls "Oil Tot"!
1926 2018-06-30 19:29:55 You hit the nail on the head - Muslims gave money - tons of it - from oil - and now they want the world - and are willing to fight and pay for it - of course the liberals are all in - it will clear up their mess and have more money in the long run
1927 2018-06-30 19:29:51 mama oil pastel on paper finished. my first oil pastel portrait aha
1928 2018-06-30 19:29:47 would be lovely to use our resources already in place since we supply 1/3 of oil supply to the world. While I 'get' the economics of allowing the prices to stay 'up,' it doesn't help the average Joe. Tho previous admin said citizens wouldn't mind paying >4 bucks!
1929 2018-06-30 19:29:36 I smear olive oil all over my chest every time Ronaldo scores #Ronaldo #CR7 #CristianoRonaldo #URUPOR #POR #WorldCup
1930 2018-06-30 19:29:29 Tell me this!! I spend about 40 USD for oil and conditioner for this thing. Best I just shave it off my face.
1931 2018-06-30 19:29:27 i would readily believe that the sky in the 2nd picture is actually a hyper-real oil painting
1932 2018-06-30 19:29:23 Not good for American oil workers!!
1933 2018-06-30 19:29:15 "Pour some null oil on me
Ooh, in the name of love"
1934 2018-06-30 19:29:14 We want a war on the old rules. We want to break the CBLs monopoly over oil revenues and the Governments monopoly of the national budget and ensrhine new rights-based fiscal rules as a baseline and guarentee for decentralised local politics and economic security.
1935 2018-06-30 19:29:14 ditch oil! go straight solar !
1936 2018-06-30 19:29:10 I need Fosters to start selling those oil cans in cases!
1937 2018-06-30 19:29:04 You do know that all happened for ONE raise in oil prices and later bus ticket prices right? You know that after plenty of raises there isn't even much proper transportation anymore right?
1938 2018-06-30 19:28:59 hahahahahahahaha More likely is the fact you made the call to make sure that your billionaire oil baron supporters can keep raking in the money. The day oil prices drop, will be the day the moon turns into green cheese and you turn into an honest person.
1939 2018-06-30 19:28:37 I love Dave’s killer bread. So good with avocado red onions some olive oil, kosher salt and aged balsamic vinegar

1943 2018-06-30 19:27:55 What promises has he kept. As far as his failings, which are legion, how does repealing no dumping of coal slurry in rivers help anyone? How does repealing protections of marine waters for oil drilling help anyone? How is lessening taxes on rich people the greater good?

For the same model to work in the USA, oil reserves 65 times the size of those found in the North Sea would need to be discovered in the USA, oil prices would need to sky rocket and the march to more sustainable sources of energy would need to halt and then it would still
1946 2018-06-30 19:27:41 YA'LL REMEMBER WHEN COD LIVER OIL WAS THE TING ?? MANN THESE HEALTH TRENDS.

1951 2018-06-30 19:27:19 @janegarvey1 and @fifiglover - the feather mattress topper and coconut oil incident was priceless. Must have looked like a mad woman laughing away whilst walking the dog #Fortunately

No Bobby.  This isn't "time"based.  It is purely luck in that Norway leveraged an unsustainable (and non-duplicatable) resource to temporarily fund socialism.  The oil reserves in the North Sea are dwindling and so is socialism in Norway.
1955 2018-06-30 19:27:13 I like my partners like I like my coconut oil: Cold, pressed, and unrefined #showerthoughts
1956 2018-06-30 19:27:11 Dote45 is @ Bedminster, cheating his way around the Dogpatch, stumping with his crooked RWNJ "donors", trying to sell potential SCOTUS Nominees on his brand of rancid, Snake Oil Politics.
1957 2018-06-30 19:27:11 thanks to my daddy for the oil change
1958 2018-06-30 19:27:01 I started the day with the intention to get things done. 4 hours trying to get an oil change later...
1959 2018-06-30 19:27:00 U mean oil cartels?

1961 2018-06-30 19:26:47 Aired up the tires, added washer fluid, and now just waiting for the oil pan to finish dripping. Woooo

1963 2018-06-30 19:26:47 I’m always afraid they’re not going to put oil back in my car And my engine is going to lock up 20 feet down the fucking road.
1964 2018-06-30 19:26:39 No I'm unsure epidemiology has any role! Nothing against olive oil per se, though it's deification is more to do with a canny olive oil Council and the fact that the med. Is a great place to invite Americans to conferences !
1965 2018-06-30 19:26:26 MENTAL HEALTH IS THE NEW COCONUT OIL . EVERYBODYS TELLING YOU ABOUT IT . EVERYBODYS SERVING IT . EVERYBODY KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT IT .
1966 2018-06-30 19:26:22 It's a great feeling!! Whether it's marching against Monsanto, Big Oil, trump, or protesting unjust treatment by our govt. #Solidarnosc feels amazing!
1967 2018-06-30 19:26:21 Why Canada got dumb. Proportional representation was not implemented. So we got pointing finger anger politics. No unity. In walks lobbyists of oil production corruption. Healthcare is missed labeled. Sick medicated fits the model.
1968 2018-06-30 19:26:00 You see my struggle. Sorry. I meant oil.
1969 2018-06-30 19:25:56 Oil money rewards strong young bodies, not mature, responsible decision making.
1970 2018-06-30 19:25:18 Didn’t have time so I boiled them for 2 mins to cook and very lightly shallow fried them with olive oil. Recipe coming up iA! Xx

1980 2018-06-30 19:24:07 TRUMP, SAUDI KING AGREES ON OIL PRODUCTION INCREASE
1981 2018-06-30 19:24:06 The oil companies control the price of gas and oil. The American oil companies just need to sell more overseas and the gas price would drop here. We have plenty of oil reserves that obama would not allow us to drill for. But you should know this already.
1982 2018-06-30 19:24:01 I’m in imagration procedures. Big oil and big pharma North America. The renewables are off the map.
1983 2018-06-30 19:24:00 @realDonaldTrump There is a simple fix #America needs to rage a all out war on gangs in America & invade any #country that gangs have taken control of we'd do it for #Oil why not for lives give #ImmigrantChildren a fighting chance free there country.
1984 2018-06-30 19:23:53 Way to break that dependency on foreign oil dipshit!!!
1985 2018-06-30 19:23:42 Also look at the influence of oil within both bush administrations, what his father tried to start and what the son felt like he finished for the father lol it’ll blow your mind man
1986 2018-06-30 19:23:25 Alam ko na gusto ko! Magpa hot oil, pakulay, pa haircut, bilhin lahat ng gusto kong bilhin! Gumala! Makalimot! Makalimutan ko sya...

1988 2018-06-30 19:23:03 #NowPlaying @ 15:22:05 ET: "The Oil Slick" by Frightened Rabbit from "Pedestrian Verse" (2013)
1989 2018-06-30 19:22:56 Exactly.Trump will lift sanctions on Russia after his summit. Putin then by use of CrimeaP/L will be able to deliver billions of barrels of oil it has been producing in the Kara Sea. Trump will make billions off this deal. This has been Putin/trumps goal from the moment trump won
1990 2018-06-30 19:22:51 I meant a pair from Cavani 
1991 2018-06-30 19:22:48 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
1992 2018-06-30 19:22:37 Right so pre1970 American dominance is misleading ...2 is a major difference because there’s no national security issue anymore. Going forward, oil will be less and less important. LNG and renewables are the future.
1993 2018-06-30 19:22:33 almost put jamie's vape liquid on my piercing instead of tea tree oil what's everyone else up to
1994 2018-06-30 19:22:27 They finna say everything wrong with my car when I get this oil change
1995 2018-06-30 19:22:20 Boss man let me leave so i can change my oil, might as well down a few while I’m out here
1996 2018-06-30 19:22:11 Lotion lotion? Or pink oil lotion?
1997 2018-06-30 19:22:11 There’s oil everywhere 
1998 2018-06-30 19:22:00 It's the story of a man named Jed -- a poor mountaineer who barely kept his family fed.  Then, one day, he was shootin' at some food, and up from the ground came a'bubblin' crude...oil that is.  Black gold!  Texas tea! #hillbillies
1999 2018-06-30 19:21:58 I thought we were Self-sufficient in America with oil? Thought we had a surplus? Also it’s Too not to.
2000 2018-06-30 19:21:56 If only we had nationalized oil, gas, and metals companies. Imagine how rich we'd be. Not to mention united as a country. Last I checked Norway has $1.2 trillion in the bank.
2001 2018-06-30 19:21:49 Peppermint essential oil will help with the swelling, eucalyptus oil too, hit up a chiropractor cause the doctor gon tell you to just rice it (rest ice and elevation) got me able to walk on my sprained foot in like 1 week. Also eat calcium rich foods and magnesium too
2002 2018-06-30 19:21:22 They replaced the “paleo” diet with the “keto” diet bc they realized how ridiculous it was to try to eat like our Paleolithic ancestors except the keto diet is still just as ridiculous. I wonder at what point paleo people realized cavemen didn’t cold press their avocado oil
2003 2018-06-30 19:21:21 Today.
2004 2018-06-30 19:21:20 I see stupidity. I’m a ex Patriot because of the stupidity. Big oil get off it wouldn’t known for 30 years. It’s ok I’m leaving North America
2005 2018-06-30 19:21:18 He means oil will remain  in elevated narrow band. Time to do SIP in Lowest cost producer in Airlines
2006 2018-06-30 19:21:17 Or are they playing the long game. They keep Russian support in not blowing OPEC apart when they had little choice at this time but to accept and they simply put production in storage and wait for world to demand their supply when oil hits $100 to which they sell at higher price.
2007 2018-06-30 19:21:11 This Castor oil will not come out this shirt
I done bleached it twice zmh
2008 2018-06-30 19:21:02 So he has agreed to sell us more oil (paid for by Americans) and make more money for his country.  After you finish putting money into the pockets of Saudi Arabia, when will you start putting money into the pockets of Americans?
2009 2018-06-30 19:20:44 Breaking: Jean Swanson “The Order of Canada is given to people who want a better country, spending billions of taxpayers dollars on an oil pipeline given the threat of climate change is not making Canada better country.” @swanson4council #stopkm #bcpoli #cdnpoli
2010 2018-06-30 19:20:38 Still selling snake oil? Reunite the families.
2011 2018-06-30 19:20:30 Buy yourself organic hair products and always spray your hair with water to be hydrated, also have a hair routine for example wash (and deep condition) your hair once a week, put on some oil (black castor oil, argan , tea tree or olive oil). Do some braids before bedtime.
2012 2018-06-30 19:20:29 Let's keep our own oil.
2013 2018-06-30 19:20:20 hahaha he's speaking like a monkey would speak on twitter. "Me spoke to Saudi Arabia. Oil much money. Price too high. Iran very bad. Saudi sed he can make more. Now I has a happy."

2017 2018-06-30 19:19:14 Mint oil feels so good to the scalp!!!
2018 2018-06-30 19:19:06 Take goat cheese, put it onto a bowl/platter whatever. Take some olive oil- put in some minced garlic, and herbs- especially lots of thyme, (but also lovage, oregano, sage), and heat through gently for 10 mins or so. Pour oil over cheese. Eat w/ bread & booze.
2019 2018-06-30 19:19:05 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2020 2018-06-30 19:19:05 And the real ironic thing is that Venezuela is an oil rich country.  Doesn’t George Soros own part of that oil?  Isn’t it Petrobas or something like that?
2021 2018-06-30 19:19:01  STOP TELLING PEOPLE TO PUT COCONUT OIL ON THEIR SKIN!
2022 2018-06-30 19:18:36 Caitlin is reluctant and has a bottle of oil, will they soothe Christopher?

Stephen gave a nod, mostly to himself, and pushed his astral form from his body.

2030 2018-06-30 19:18:06 #BiggBossMarathi Pushkar is trying to play a game by adding Oil into Sai and Megha fight ?
2031 2018-06-30 19:18:05 Why are you shocked? Look at who is in charge & he is requesting 2 million gallons of oil from Saudi Arabia  rather than promote solar energy & electric vehicles. #Isupportcleanenergy electric vehicles are our future. Solar power is our future.
2032 2018-06-30 19:17:53 there you go just what we need. To become more dependent on the Saudis again for oil. Why don't you look to your own oil.
2033 2018-06-30 19:17:43 Trump is probably cutting oil imports to raise US gas price. He's probably getting a kickback from US O&G Cos for raising the price/barrel of oil & increasing their profits. I remember the gas lines from the Nixon Oil Embargo.
2034 2018-06-30 19:17:38 Interesting I wonder if Canada will raise tariffs on exports of oil to the US? #whopays
2035 2018-06-30 19:17:38 Just remember: this guy wants you to stop putting coconut oil in your coffee...BUT wants you to take viagra  and basically sells $60 blueberry pills? T-nation is officially canceled.

2037 2018-06-30 19:17:18 What was your problem with your A5? Mine is is 2010 model brought brand new but it had oil consumption problems in exactly 2 months. Later on had a cam belt problem , now the back windscreen is caving in, I hope yours is not a Cabriolet too.
2038 2018-06-30 19:16:55 So @SimonjBridges and @NZNationalParty policies are not only on the the wrong side of climate change science but continued unbridled oil exploration and pushing animal agriculture industry growth especially dairy rboth main contributors to climate change & global warming activity
2039 2018-06-30 19:16:47 Don’t worry I took Jamyes car to get an oil change not to long ago and they called me Mr. Utley

2044 2018-06-30 19:16:20 Oops.  I believe Cadet Bone Spur is mistaken.  However, oil production on the planet Covfefe will increase....coal too! That Cadet Bone Spur sure is a goodly negotiator!
2045 2018-06-30 19:15:55 I know some have short memory, so I've to recall you what exactly happened. Iraqi Governmental forces were simply guaranteeing "rules of the Constitution" A Constitution stating the government is responsible for International oil deal, and safety of all Iraqi Borders.
2046 2018-06-30 19:15:47 You spoke like know-it-all person , who told you saudi ran out of oil , saudi now produce 10 million and it has capacity to produce 12,5 million
2047 2018-06-30 19:15:39 “Too” not “to”you are an embarrassment and it’s your fault the oil is going up... or was this your plan all along? Give Saudi’s more money?

2058 2018-06-30 19:14:16 Known reserves and exploration fail to provide the "cheap" oil upon which modern tech depends.

2080 2018-06-30 19:12:03 Doubt it. Because those billions aren't enough. Trump is totally cutting off oil revenues to the regime. That's over 200 billion lost in one year. Not to mention the countless companies that will pull out. With further devaluation of thecurrency, more Iranians will pull out funds

2084 2018-06-30 19:11:28 I thought you said we didn’t need to rely on the Middle East for oil ...
2085 2018-06-30 19:11:24 Quotas in hiring or changing standards to accommodate diversity are just social engineering to what end? 
Too many Asians getting too smart flooding universities, make it harder for them and easier for others. Meritocracy should rule
2086 2018-06-30 19:11:19 Libra: Likatya, I heard all of the angels are gathering tomorrow?

2089 2018-06-30 19:10:58 "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords." ✞Psalms 55:21 #Jesus #God #Bible
2090 2018-06-30 19:10:58 They should add "walking the plank", "keel hauling", boiling in oil, the guillotine, extra.
2091 2018-06-30 19:10:46 As for Venezuela, you wouldn't even be talking about it if US oligarchs weren't so obsessed with getting their hands on its oil. There are suffering people all over the world. The US supports 70% of the world's authoritarian regimes. Focusing on Venezuela is pure hypocrisy!
2092 2018-06-30 19:10:35 i got the vegetarian option at my friends grad party and god... it’s just unseasoned pasta drenched in 2 cups of olive oil
2093 2018-06-30 19:10:31 INVEST IN CANADIAN OIL. We are friends of the US and democracy
2094 2018-06-30 19:10:30 Big Oil can afford to take a hit.
2095 2018-06-30 19:10:24 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
2096 2018-06-30 19:10:23 Sounds like what he said about US Steel opening up a new plant, Saudis increasing oil production and that there was no collusion with the Russians.
2097 2018-06-30 19:10:05 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
2098 2018-06-30 19:10:03 Be careful though! Tea tree oil is toxic to cats
2099 2018-06-30 19:09:56 Yup! The reeds soak up the oil and the scent sort of wafts
2100 2018-06-30 19:09:24 Did an oil change on the Z and it was stupid hot. Debating if I should detail it
2101 2018-06-30 19:09:23 2)was able to refill. Once she tossed, she noticed her oxy (she’s a 5X cancer survivor) missing only to find he was taking those. I call that addiction whether it’s textbook or not. She tossed those as well. I got him CBD oil which he used with success and is now doing better.
2102 2018-06-30 19:09:13 The irony of course is that the first and only time Iran had a democratically elected leader, Mossadegh, doing BP Oil's bidding, the CIA made sure he was ousted (1953?). Khomeini worked over 20 yrs in Paris fomenting the revolution of 1979.
2103 2018-06-30 19:09:12 The legacy decline in the Permian was last year 1.2 mill bpd  . This increased to 2.6 mill bpd this year and will likely reach over 4 mill bpd by next year. The total US oil and gas legacy decline will go over 12 mill boe pd and year. Truly horrific numbers.
2104 2018-06-30 19:09:11 Love  cbd oil
2105 2018-06-30 19:09:11 You, an idiot, at any sign of illness: Walgreens brand cold medicine.

Me, a multicultural goddess of the sea: pickled garlic, canned anchovies and diced tomatoes soaked in extra virgin olive oil.

2109 2018-06-30 19:08:44 Huh! I use neem oil in my shampoo & sometimes on my skin... talk to me please! Do I stop?
2110 2018-06-30 19:08:43 My infection cleared up. I can sing again. I have my script for legally blonde. I got my oil changed. I finally drank coffee for the first time since Tuesday. Life is good.
2111 2018-06-30 19:08:25 Yes a bit of oil and into a frying pan did the trick. :)
2112 2018-06-30 19:08:17 A whole list of unhelpful ways of talking about current developments in machine learning. For example: Data is the new oil:  ( BS phrase most popular in the translation industry), Google and China (or Facebook, or Amazon, or BAT) have all the data and AI will take all the jobs
2113 2018-06-30 19:08:10 The toothpaste didnt work. Maybe baby oil will. Thanks!
2114 2018-06-30 19:08:04 Yeah we have hydro power nailed down in Quebec. Strange that our government is obsessed with building transmission lines south to the states vs to Ontario. Same with pipelines. I know they're risky, but in the event of an emergency, I want Alta oil flowing to Canadians.
2115 2018-06-30 19:08:03 Are you intentionally and deliberately trying to destroy the US oil industry?  We get just 9% of our imported oil from Saudi Arabia.  40% comes from...CANADA.  Some "stable genius" you are.
2116 2018-06-30 19:08:01 Missing an “o” in too...so #Obama had his finger in Saudi Arabia oil pot

2121 2018-06-30 19:07:21 I had that problem and realized it was due to oil build up on the screen at most used touchpoints.  Gave the screen a good cleaning and problem solved.

2126 2018-06-30 19:06:59 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2127 2018-06-30 19:06:56 Sorry what do you mean? You are unsure that olive oil has any role in nutrition?
2128 2018-06-30 19:06:49 @SkinnyTanHQ so disappointed ordered your special on tan and tone oil I am very pale and made no difference at all! Really disappointed

2130 2018-06-30 19:06:33 Chavez in Venezuela had universal care.. I'm sure of it.. now they are eating zoo animals.. except they are all gone too.. eating cats now. 
Nationalize oil fields; no one left to crack the whip on maintenance & machinery froze shut. Can't pump oil very well when pumps out.
2131 2018-06-30 19:06:14 That’s great news! Why should we have to ask the Saudi’s for oil increases? Did it ever strike you as odd that we have to ask them? Really?
2132 2018-06-30 19:06:14 Yep, nothing confirms Lee's legitimate point better than condemnation from an openly racist imperialist drunkard, the kind of guy you can count on to help engineer a coup against a democratically elected leader who was going to *gasp* nationalise oil that BP felt entitled to!
2133 2018-06-30 19:06:12 Wow I need to buy Bio oil or something for all these burns on my legs
2134 2018-06-30 19:05:53 Tea tree oil!!
2135 2018-06-30 19:05:41 Well we are seeing that in real time. One I find fascinating is the bs policy with Iran that lead to higher oil that benefited Russia
2136 2018-06-30 19:05:39 Apparently getting your oil changed now requires the same time investment as a complete engine overhaul.
2137 2018-06-30 19:05:37 The lights are back,I'm leaving this longue
2138 2018-06-30 19:05:17 maybe not but nutella is consorting with palm oil and this i shall not allow in my temple (Chocolate though is good and that def sounds amazing)
2139 2018-06-30 19:05:14 Oil is the new whale oil, primitive, inexcusable, brutal
2140 2018-06-30 19:05:04 DONALD will make a deal with Putin, for Russia to increase output, and the friends stop buying Iran oil, and RUSSIANsuppose to be Iran allies,
2141 2018-06-30 19:04:47 I need classes on that accent
2142 2018-06-30 19:04:42 The back of my wig looks like I sprayed a whole can of oil sheen on it.
2143 2018-06-30 19:04:35 Off baby duty and back in bed. Watching the Jackal (Edward Fox) and smoking hash oil.
2144 2018-06-30 19:04:35 That's ridiculous to compare public education, socialized health care, public infrastructure funding and a responsible immigration policy (that accounts for tax free labor...the real obstacle from business) with the overreach of a one note oil state.
2145 2018-06-30 19:04:24 Change oil
2146 2018-06-30 19:04:19 Actually I don't know properly about this.I think there need a research about the present status of oil spill and it's impact on environment and biodiversity in the Bangladesh portion of Sundarbans.
2147 2018-06-30 19:04:17 It not for you to do policy like this....it supposed to be OPEC decision.....you are playing god abusing power as to when u want with anything....from china trade war to oil....then u might as well declare yourself king of Saudi Arabia and Canada...after all u think like god
2148 2018-06-30 19:04:12 Started my CBD oil journey yesterday...and I can not say how good it is! I haven’t even felt anxious once! And it’s helped with my pain loads! Guys if you suffer anxiety or chronic pain...you have to try the CBD oil! It’s incredible.

2152 2018-06-30 19:03:23 What an embarrassing tweet. It shows that you know nothing about Venezuela apart from western media and US imperialist propaganda. Look at abi martin's video on YouTube for another version. Remember the CIA is funding right wing groups to achieve regime change. They want the oil.
2153 2018-06-30 19:03:19 Oga goan buy better oil perfume from @ohandieze.No dey disturb us for here,rain go still fall reach October seff

2155 2018-06-30 19:02:57 Ronaldo giving them that inspiration
2156 2018-06-30 19:02:36 It's a contradiction for us to be eating Ofada and support campaign against Climate Change. The way ofada sauce oil is bleached until the onions are fried burnt must be addressed at the next UN Earth Summit.

2158 2018-06-30 19:02:31 Saudi Arabia has always increased oil production to destabilize other economies.
2159 2018-06-30 19:02:30 Iran is studying ways to keep exporting oil and other measures to counter U.S. economic sanctions, state news agency IRNA reported on Saturday....

The $322million recovered Abacha loots Buhari is sharing to Northern States comes from sales of crude oil from the Niger Delta region, yet no state from that region is getting the planned conditional cash transfer.
2166 2018-06-30 19:01:55 Remind me never to recruit you to an emergency operation on an exploding oil rig 40 miles out to sea.
2167 2018-06-30 19:01:52 Can you do a like for like comparison with oil exploration extraction, refining, and burning?

2169 2018-06-30 19:01:23 I mean she did, which is just as bad if not worse. Jill Stein has millions invested in oil, big tobacco, etc. She’s nothing but a narcissist.

2172 2018-06-30 19:01:16 I looked for her,n we're best friends now
2173 2018-06-30 19:01:14 I agree totally. Also,  I think there should be substantiated proof that @realDonaldTrump got Saudi Arabia to increase their oil out, as was reported and against OPEC polices. MSM needs to do a better job, calling out his lies... #StrengthInNumbers
2174 2018-06-30 19:00:59 Trump is an oil man like Putin.Unless they can be convinced to change they will go down in history as names synonymous with massive death. They will make Stalin Mao and Hitler look like childs play as they unleash the fury and power of climate change upon us. God help us all.
2175 2018-06-30 19:00:39 Im laid up in my backyard. Blasting Scorpion. Drinking ice cold Fiji. Spraying Banana Boat dry tanning oil.
2176 2018-06-30 19:00:34 but when they grow up and realize they have to pay their own Xbox and car loan and mortgage and  pay taxes that goes not to them, not to their schools, neighborhoods or businesses but to support ilegal immigrants then we'll see if socialism seems so cool
2177 2018-06-30 19:00:23 This is your alter ego. Saudis were responsible for 9/11. Go on attack Saudi Arabia. Look at the oil.

2179 2018-06-30 19:00:08 Getting close to the stagflationary moment in oil once people realize the world has no more spare capacity - suddenly offshore investing in the US will catch on

2181 2018-06-30 19:00:05 If your dog's hair is matted with paint/tar/sticky material - trim with clippers or soak the area with vegetable or mineral oil for 24 hrs.
2182 2018-06-30 18:59:49 Better than dealing with Iran. They have money & oil, NK doesn’t have those advantages
2183 2018-06-30 18:59:42 @GOVUK Please do not allow SOTO International to harm gorillas in the DRC area.  What can we do to stop their oil exploration in this natural habitat?  This is evil and harms us as humans!

2189 2018-06-30 18:59:12 All of us from Canada would love to send you our oil being as we are your neighbours, but unfortunately Trudeau our boy child leader is mentally handicapped. Did you put him on the no fly list yet for paying off ISIS terrorists.
2190 2018-06-30 18:59:09 On some real shit  why my oil change $50 ugh everybody else pay $20 wtffff

2194 2018-06-30 18:58:19 I’ll do your oil change for you 
2195 2018-06-30 18:58:15 Because too much of our nation's wealth is tied to oil.

2198 2018-06-30 18:57:48 Good initiative. Next up: 1/ get rid of Abdi Iley, 2/ set fair oil revenue sharing agreement with region for sake of stability, 3/ the PM must not pardon the unrepentant Mengistu. A step too far, that will sour the public towards him #Ethiopia
2199 2018-06-30 18:57:40 Went to @IndigoWild just for body oil left with a bag full of goodies and I’m not upset at all! Im about to be smelling so good 
2200 2018-06-30 18:57:26 This does not make America great again. When SA increases oil production,it affects oil jobs in Texas, The Dakota’s, Oklahoma..Takes American jobs & gives them at low cost to Middle Eastern companies who have no OSHA rules (human rights )SA is also a covert sponsor of terrorist.
2201 2018-06-30 18:57:22 Apparently 45 is cutting any help to the solar industry in order to fuel the oil industry
2202 2018-06-30 18:57:19 i’ve done some nasty things with coconut oil
2203 2018-06-30 18:57:16 While getting oil change:... manager: “how much you weigh” new worker: “uhh 150?” Manager: “alight son get in the car crank it and back it on up”.... “you got a pedal?... go head back it up slow maybe it won’t crash wid ya” Me to myself: omg my cars gonna break down now...
2204 2018-06-30 18:57:09 overheard getting oil changed: dad "your mom's having the girls over for dinner" 6 yr old "the alcoholics?"
2205 2018-06-30 18:56:53 Why not increase American oil production domestically?
2206 2018-06-30 18:56:48 Not against any of that and the best of the best always comes to the fore. The promotion of diversity just for the sake of diversity is the driving force for many even when there is no tangible benefit. In fact could be the opposite, and it's still pushed.
2207 2018-06-30 18:56:47 Do you agree with this Neil or is it marketing by the oil companies?
2208 2018-06-30 18:56:45 ต้องง้อมั้ยอ่ะ
2209 2018-06-30 18:56:42 So you're colluding with the Saudi's, who had the highest number of terrorists on the planes on 9/11, to manipulate oil prices ahead of the mid-term elections????
2210 2018-06-30 18:56:40 Not true, this is part of the Sanctions on Iran oil export. You need to connect facts in a correct manner. Do not speculate !!!
2211 2018-06-30 18:56:34 All oil must covert to nuclear energy now. Your sons and daughters will pay the price of your climate denial folly.
2212 2018-06-30 18:56:19 Get Tabletop Simulator on Steam, "Snake Oil" is a perennial favorite of mine. Pandemic is also really friggin' good. Cards Against Humanity (of course), Exploding Kittens, and the myriad games you can play with just a normal deck of playing cards are also fun, if not board games.
2213 2018-06-30 18:56:00 So let me get this straight, Trump hikes oil prices by pulling out of Iran deal and reinstating sanctions, which hurts oil importers like the USA and benefits Russia. So he either really didn't think it through or is a traitor, or both.
2214 2018-06-30 18:55:54 Avon dry oil spray not in the new avon book but I can back  order it. if any one wants any? 2 quid a bottle  orders are going in on the 8th july x
2215 2018-06-30 18:55:49 Yes they did agree as requested by Trump, firstly, he asked them to increase by a Million last week. After they agreed. He went on to ask his Allied to completely stop exporting oil from Iran to zero. That's when oil prices went up again on the week. Hence his new tweet to ask
2216 2018-06-30 18:55:38 Def the oil sis

2218 2018-06-30 18:55:35 I switched to pink solution for my laundry and cleaning around the house. I put a few drops of lemongrass or lavender essential oil in mine. But the scent is super faint after washing.
2219 2018-06-30 18:55:33 it is so hot in my room that my coconut oil (which is usually like a soft solid-y texture) is now pure liquid 
2220 2018-06-30 18:55:32 อ้าว งอน ผมอุตส่าห์ง้อ เสียใจ
2221 2018-06-30 18:55:30 Dollar prices? Oil prices? Why spread half lies? We should always toe the path of honor, regardless of the side we're on.
2222 2018-06-30 18:55:27 Ben asked me why my mom was looking at napkins while checking  the oil today... boy needs some help
2223 2018-06-30 18:55:23 The oil is nationalized, give him the green book
2224 2018-06-30 18:55:12 @maddow 
Trump says Saudi king agreed to raise oil output by up to 2 million barrels - I saw a news report on the Saudi King's decision to up their oil output over a week ago.  Nothing about Trump in the report.
2225 2018-06-30 18:55:12 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.
2226 2018-06-30 18:55:09 For skincare, the First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream is a must have moisturizer. It's so hydrating and perfect for all skin types. I've also heard great things about the Kopari coconut body glow and coconut rose toner!! For acne, try The Body Shop's tea tree oil!
2227 2018-06-30 18:54:49 Set prices to high and let the oil flow!

2230 2018-06-30 18:54:23 Trying to listen to anything but @SOPHIEMSMSMSM’s “Oil” is like trying to get under someone to get over someone but you just thinking about them the whole time.
2231 2018-06-30 18:54:16 rumor has it that the Chinese are massively moving their USD reserves into oil. including buying American oil to alleviate the trade imbalance

2237 2018-06-30 18:53:23 Which will drive down the price of oil and put American oil producers out of work . He is an idiot . fake president
2238 2018-06-30 18:53:19 It’s officially that hot in my flat that my jar of coconut oil has melted. Thanks #Heatwaveuk 
2239 2018-06-30 18:53:18 I mean I agree the Oil over payed on the KHL goalie, but I hardly see how adding Steve Mason to the free agent pool impacts anything. I’d rather have a lottery ticket than a guy who is guaranteed to be bad.
2240 2018-06-30 18:53:12 What happened to the pipeline from Alberta, CA to the US? We already know that North America has more oil than anywhere else in the world!!!
2241 2018-06-30 18:52:58 one of the benefits of playing for an oil club in a second tier league. fresher.
2242 2018-06-30 18:52:39 The current shade of my skin is nothing short of fucking ridiculous. Oil’s going right in the bin
2243 2018-06-30 18:52:27 Ignorance is when you don’t know something.  We know Trump is lying about this since Saudi Arabia already announced they were increasing oil production days ago.  However Trump is ignorant to knowing the difference between “to” and “too”.
2244 2018-06-30 18:52:26 Water will be the new oil, you watch, that's why westmonster et al are trying to stir up trouble and division.
2245 2018-06-30 18:51:50 @Netenyahuisrael I think Israel and jordan as the leading successful economic and countries where gcc are failure nations fully dependant on oil and Egypt is poor ailing... So I think jordan and Israel are leading the earth besides Korea Japan
2246 2018-06-30 18:51:43 Not necessarily..I got to know her through AQ's jam on which she was featured..saw the video on Hiptv I think
2247 2018-06-30 18:51:41 Idk if it’s me or my flat irons but I can never get my hair silky straight . Like idk what I need to do because if I put too much oil then it be greasy & stuck together
2248 2018-06-30 18:51:40 I think it’s has more to do with America taking your oil at a cut rate to supply you with low standard service on goods

2254 2018-06-30 18:51:16 You've got me there. Maybe whatever they have to use to clean up the mess every time BP cause an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?
2255 2018-06-30 18:51:08 The oil cooler on the F4U Corsair has the same effect, thus the “Screaming Death” nickname.
2256 2018-06-30 18:51:07 I guess chimps don't pay the bills...maybe time for people to put their money down and offer to pay DRC the revenue they'd get from oil in exchange for not drilling? But sadly they won't...

Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns

2258 2018-06-30 18:50:48 #WR: Iran feels the impact of the US sanctions. @Reuters says that “Iran is studying ways to keep exporting oil and other measures to counter U.S. economic sanctions.” Meanwhile, in the domestic side, Iranian protesters complain against the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the regime.
2259 2018-06-30 18:50:25 i wonder if spread sheets are a man thing. His detail is amazing ....
2260 2018-06-30 18:50:11 OPEC had already agreed to increase oil production. Unfortunately that kind of news is buried under the avalanche of Trump madness every single day.
2261 2018-06-30 18:50:09 This is ridiculous! He should know if the Saudis increase their output, US oil producers, will certainly be hurt by the lower price. And so will Putin's Russia,whose economy is just starting to recover from the increase of oil price.
2262 2018-06-30 18:50:06 It’s spelled dysfunction, and we don’t get oil from either country
2263 2018-06-30 18:49:58 Why don't you increase the US oil production and raise the tariffs on foreign oil instead?
2264 2018-06-30 18:49:56 I was talking about North Sea oil , closest to GB, not Mid East oil!
2265 2018-06-30 18:49:56 Can you please focus your attention on #Virunga in the #DRC. #Soco has efficiently destabilized the region to be allowed to drill oil from the last habitat of the #mountaingorilla How can this be allowed to happen in this day and age? #takeaction #savevirunga
2266 2018-06-30 18:49:34 Getting my oil change. As I’m here waiting for it to be done, there is a Twilight marathon on their tv. Shit I might as well stay here all day lol
2267 2018-06-30 18:49:30 The economic effects of rising gas prices is the key factor for the slow down of our economy.  Trump will not stop the shipping oil overseas b/c big oil is profiting big time. Just remember when ther was a huge surplus & prices were low!!!
2268 2018-06-30 18:49:27 Siempre, pero siempre estuve de acuerdo con Ud, pero esta vez, voy a discernir con Ud. Para mí el objetivo del #Oil es de 18,53.  Saludos

2274 2018-06-30 18:48:43 Booty rubs con baby oil
2275 2018-06-30 18:48:39 It is what it is. We have about 60 years left of oil, estimates, even though earth is continually making more.
2276 2018-06-30 18:48:34 Yeah, it's all about our first exposure to it I think.  America really went into overdrive for Gulf 1 in a way that would be hard to understand for people who missed it.  We were very army-shy in the 80s and then BAM holy shit let's smart bomb these oil stealin' iraqis.
2277 2018-06-30 18:48:17 US already exports the most oil. Now bro needs to make money for his friends.

2283 2018-06-30 18:47:42 need to wait for the outcome, of DONALDand Putin summit if the USA friends stop buying Iran oil Russia and Saudi will increase the output so we won't be better off in long run.
2284 2018-06-30 18:47:40 All oil fields or just those in the east?
2285 2018-06-30 18:47:18 India should stop importing oil from muslim countries !!!
2286 2018-06-30 18:46:53 Trump just asked MBS to increase crude to 2m barrels to cover shortfall from Venezuela & Iran
Crude is going for $74per barrel More money to oil producing nations, but more expenses to non-oil producing nations
This means the US is systematically regulating our pace of growth
2287 2018-06-30 18:46:51 You don’t produce oil, it’s is extracted from a reservoir. These reservoirs run out at some point and you don’t seem prepared for this time point in the near future.

2289 2018-06-30 18:46:45 Bruh, you simply sound stupid now.
2290 2018-06-30 18:46:40 Getting an oil change is like going to the doctor for a routine physical and waiting to be told you already died.
2291 2018-06-30 18:46:37 My dad puts our tanning oil that’s like spf 8 on his head if that counts lmao
2292 2018-06-30 18:46:31 US oil producers require high prices to make a profit.   So, this actually makes me quite happy.
2293 2018-06-30 18:45:57 Yes for his own interest more oil more revenue  more arm sales for USA
2294 2018-06-30 18:45:57 You’re wrong. The use of deadly force is permitted if a reasonable person believes they are in danger of losing their lives or under threat of great bodily harm. A firearms instructor is great for advice on shooting. What the laws say are great for, you know, what’s legal.
2295 2018-06-30 18:45:48 Is that baby oil.?
2296 2018-06-30 18:45:47 What an Idiot!!!  Trump wants the Saudis to overflow the market with oil so that the oil prices of other countries should fall.  That will put Canada, Venezuela, and other small countries ina deep Recession.  The Saudis should refuse.
2297 2018-06-30 18:45:46 Trump administration is unlike any other, Perry has long standing ties to Kremlin oil
2298 2018-06-30 18:45:46 How does trump want higher energy prices? He just negotiated lower oil
2299 2018-06-30 18:45:45 Because of this, the free market does not, and cannot, exist in any necessary marketplace. Oil? You have to drive to work. Electricity? Water? These are necessities. You can’t say “no” which means you’re a *captive* market. Captive markets harm consumers.

2301 2018-06-30 18:45:26 But the bottom line is, the sanctions placed on Iran, along with his actions in Israel have created instability in the region and are directly to blame for the increase in oil prices.  The irony of it is when OPEC increases output and prices drop, it kills our domestic oil.
2302 2018-06-30 18:45:23 America had a surplus of oil under Obama. Our export of oil increased by 50%. Why not increase our production so America can profit instead of Saudi Arabia?

2304 2018-06-30 18:45:02 Interesting I never heard of grape seed oil lemme see
2305 2018-06-30 18:44:58 Pre-empting #Iran stoppage with additional production means that the best the market can hope for is to have production at current levels once Iran is out of the market > cannot find a more bullish scenario! #oil
2306 2018-06-30 18:44:32 Great. Let’s contribute to the problem by increasing the use of oil instead of using our innavative minds to make use of the many forms of energy that don’t poison the air we breathe and destroy the world! Get a fucking clue man!
2307 2018-06-30 18:44:27 I love it! Prefer it or grape seed oil.
2308 2018-06-30 18:44:26 Okay so what? Our oil our decision and interests! Your interest is to support terrorists that is the difference
2309 2018-06-30 18:44:25 Hmmm, inner conflict on this. I’m long oil via $RYE & $MRO, but also long $KSA.

Many people are saying?
2313 2018-06-30 18:43:56 Could you not ask @JustinTrudeau if Canada could increase oil production?  Probably not.

Can you provide the Oil & other commodities that we get from Iran at the same price and insurance?

2326 2018-06-30 18:43:07 Just because trump asked sadie Arabia oil will increase. Wonder what that cost us.
2327 2018-06-30 18:43:05 All non-nuclear energy is from the sun. why not convert and use it directly. oil has so much external cost, it will be banned as energy source eventually.
2328 2018-06-30 18:42:56 I just found out a nice bouquet of flowers is about 50$ while a full gram cartridge of delicious thc oil is about 50$, now the question is which would i prefer?

2331 2018-06-30 18:42:28 This is why it is impossible to gauge actual supply and demand for oil.  Official production and reserve numbers worldwide are cooked and supply itself is manipulated.  This ends up making oil stocks more volatile than they could be.
2332 2018-06-30 18:42:19 Anyone notice that #Trump's Muslim ban countries, trump targeted, are competition for Saudi Arabia's oil exports. Any Country's Govt that let's trump build golf courses and resorts there, the people in charge, can't do no wrong

2343 2018-06-30 18:41:39 So let me get this straight... you want #SaudiArabia to go back in time millions of years, create more dinosaurs, kill said dinosaurs in Saudi Arabia, then come back to the present and dig for their corpses once they turn into oil? I knew they had time machines!

2354 2018-06-30 18:40:26 I think analysts who think that #Trump drew a line in the sand at $80 #oil are wrong. His real target is complete and utter stoppage of #Iran oil sales without market unraveling. The definition of unraveling varies but I think beyond $100 qualifies. He would be ok with $90-100

2359 2018-06-30 18:39:31 A democratic, oil rich Iran, that had at least normal relations if not friendly ones with America and Israel, is basically the Arab world's worst nightmare. Gotta remember the Arab vs Persian rivalry is older than even their sectarian Shiite vs Sunni one.
2360 2018-06-30 18:39:21 Sorry if you feel "embarrassed". Next time do some research before defending socialism and posting imbecilic videos by imbeciles offering preposterously imbecilic explanations for why the people of oil rich SOCIALIST Venezuela literally don't have enough to eat or medicine.

2362 2018-06-30 18:39:12 So, His Highness @KingSalman  supports moving US embassy 2 Jerusalem, supports tearing up JCPOA n now increase oil production so that people in Iran go hungry because of US sanctions? Is this what "Custodian of Two Holy Mosques" means to be? @OIC_OCI @RT_Erdogan @HassanRouhani
2363 2018-06-30 18:39:09 Is it weird that I find seasoning cast iron to be oddly therapeutic and zen? There's something about repeatedly rubbing oil all over metal, into every nook and cranny with your bare hands, that is almost meditative.
2364 2018-06-30 18:38:54 #OOTT #Oil #WTI 
A fellow's opinion: "In fact the #IEA suggest #Saudi only has 1.8m of capacity." 
What's the difference between 1.8M and 2.0M? What matters is how oil markets react to #Trump's request. It cannot be bullish for sure. Expect another gap down at Sunday open.
2365 2018-06-30 18:38:43 You are supposed to dilute tea tree oil. It is very strong and can burn your face..

2368 2018-06-30 18:38:14 Why is that a surprise? No one announced that oil supplies were running out.
2369 2018-06-30 18:37:46 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts hemp seed oil with 1 part red wine vinegar and 1 part avocado. Add pepper and maple syrup to taste.
2370 2018-06-30 18:37:24 oil is at $74.25/barrel now so we'll see.

2373 2018-06-30 18:37:05 The oil industry won't die, they'll just start buying up EV Charging Networks like BP and Chargemaster plc.
2374 2018-06-30 18:37:01 Everyone knows 9/11 was a drama to invade Iraq for oil but  Muslims did not blame your religions and Prophets for their loss and casualties. 
Now tell us Mr. Geert Wilders who is the real extremist?
2375 2018-06-30 18:36:52 How about something intelligent AND valid? Like our inability to extract & refine our own oil, leaving us at the mercy of other nations. Stupid spending tens of billions on defense when there will be no oil to fuel ships & planes!

2381 2018-06-30 18:35:59 More oil production.Amazing effort President. Thank God for you!
2382 2018-06-30 18:35:58 Graduated and got an oil change? Look at you go slaying life, hell yeah!
2383 2018-06-30 18:35:58 Requirement for her to drive. Check oil, change tires, check air pressure, etc ;)
2384 2018-06-30 18:35:56 This is the reason and only reason Norway has been able to pay for it. Even that is starting to crumble as the oil reserves dwindle, so will the welfare state. Norway is doomed, ultimately.
2385 2018-06-30 18:35:54 Really. He put missiles facing Belgium, killed 200 Europeans in Syria, undercut their main source of economic power by upping oil production, convinced Europe to spend more on their defense against ,Europe?, and ended an agreement which gave more money and power to Russia’s Ally?
2386 2018-06-30 18:35:46 With every tweet the story of global oil complacency 2015-2018 becomes mo' dead.  There is not a bearish narrative to replace it to be found on this planet. #oott #crc #sn #anydamnep #hedgeyourpersonalenergycosts

2388 2018-06-30 18:35:38 Tea tree oil can be very strong, you could be allergic to it, or it could be too intense for your skin. I'd just wash your face with just water for a while until it goes away, if it doesn't in a few days go to your doctor!!
2389 2018-06-30 18:35:30 How can you do both? Cut dependence on Iran oil and support Iran's Chabahar
2390 2018-06-30 18:35:18 You actually ordered him to reduce the oil price and the king nothing replied :I am at your service sir! Let me increase the production, reduce the price and make the natural resources of my contry as cheap as shit! Hope this shit one day cover all your ugly face, Mr.president.

2396 2018-06-30 18:34:33 The King isn't doing you any favors, because his economy declined during the oil glut of 2016 when the US became oil sufficient under Obama. You created demand to help the King by destabilizing Irian and and Venezuela production. @ananavarro @Lawrence @UKParliament @GOP @DNC

2405 2018-06-30 18:33:22 Can not press like, it' s strange to give a like to something like that. Sorry and respect for the ones to sacrifice for so noble cause and I WISH that motherfuckers find no oil and go home.
2406 2018-06-30 18:33:19 Strong Trump just talk to King Salmon. I told him if he makes more oil for Trump, I will get beautiful hooker to visit him at Trump Tower. Surprise! It’s Melanie!! King Salmon like that very hard. Anyway, playing lots of golf today. Wish me luck losers. #MAGA

2410 2018-06-30 18:32:53 For years GOP wanted to drill so we didn't depend on OPEC. Now we produce huge amounts of oil and we export it. How come Trump doesn't demand we use our own big beautiful oil? More jobs for refineries
2411 2018-06-30 18:32:51 I was about to take my car for a oil change , get a car wash , then work but now whole day changed now, now my car at home with a fucked uo back bumper n didn’t get oil change now I’m late for work... missing money.. so mad

2417 2018-06-30 18:32:17 So I used this tea tree oil face wash a couple days ago and ever since my entire face has this weird rash... any ideas why or what I can do to fix it?! 
2418 2018-06-30 18:32:13 Yes. Thank you & thank you Mr President for supporting the natural gas industry & not the faux, lying so -called "enviro-mental" ( they're "mental" alright). Al Gore was nothing more but a snake oil salesman.
2419 2018-06-30 18:32:13 Maybe he will grow up to be a snake oil peddler on TV and have a daughter who lies for a living.
2420 2018-06-30 18:32:13 I can’t know what’s in the paper since the paper is not named in the pic. Would love to check it out, along with smoking, vegetable oil consumption, mustaches ... even if sat fat was the only association found, it remains an association.

2430 2018-06-30 18:31:00 All Trump talk is trash. Saudis agreed means nothing. Saudis can't take decisions like that as OPEC decides how much oil they will pump. India succumbed to US pressure to Buy shale oil.from US substituting Iran oil. Clearly India and Iran are the loosers in this deal.
2431 2018-06-30 18:30:54 Saudi's King Soliman fires back at IQ45's tweet claiming Saudi King was going to raise oil production 2M barrels. Soliman said they never talked about it at all.

2435 2018-06-30 18:30:29 Clean it with warm water and sea salt. Every other day and dry it properly. Use an oil for moisturizer. Be careful touching it and stuff when your hands are dirty.

2454 2018-06-30 18:28:17 That's the kind of job only found in the Alberta Oil industry. Nowhere else in the world has jobs like that. With the possible exception of Saudi princes.
2455 2018-06-30 18:28:13 My questions are whether this is a bribe to the Saudis for future help or solicitation of future (personal?) rewards from the Saudis; and what happened to Trump's boasts/ aspirations for US energy self-sufficiency or is it just a way of pushing up the value of US oil reserves?

2485 2018-06-30 18:24:53 Yup no one saw that coming. With Tesla the issue has never been the demand so it shouldn’t matter if oil is 40 or 70 they are still going to be constrained by production. so i’m not sure how that will factor into the bull thesis.

2506 2018-06-30 18:22:37 What happened to ending importing oil?
2507 2018-06-30 18:22:35 The Oil companies are just plain salty that #Tesla have brought to life an alternative method of powering cars that don’t rely on them or the destruction of our planet!
2508 2018-06-30 18:22:28 Because we're still attached to foreign oil :(
2509 2018-06-30 18:22:16 oh please, he knows no more about oil production and the cartels than he does about anything else.  Zippy-doo-dah-zilch.
2510 2018-06-30 18:22:15 Why does Trump want to destroy the US oil industry?What happened to energy independence? Does he want to build hotel in Saudi Arabia?  Anyone told him in 2017 we imported 40% of our oil from CANADA and only 9% from Saudi Arabia? I thought this guy was smart?  I guess not.
2511 2018-06-30 18:22:14 So bottom line is they dont want oil to be drilled or something like that?
2512 2018-06-30 18:22:12 Why don’t we just invade them and take their oil boss? #MAGA
2513 2018-06-30 18:21:55 لا ياصفا ذولي يجون في ناقلات النفط من برا ياخذون oil او ناخذ من عندهم
2514 2018-06-30 18:21:53 Thanks for fighting any unjust war we send you on to go free some oil. We thank you with a place on our street to live when you are no longer wanted, unless you lose a limb then we truly sorry & give you benefits.
2515 2018-06-30 18:21:53 They are all in this for the profit ; his visit to Saudi Arabia on his swing to the G20 was to solidify his new partners in crime plus Russia minus Iran who he sanctioned their Oil ; it was never about the nukes but the price of oil for greater profit for which trump has 19%  !?!
2516 2018-06-30 18:21:43 The Impractical Jokers maybe. They said they would send the oil directly to the White House so Trump could dispense it himself. They even included a free pump!
2517 2018-06-30 18:21:42 So, it's treason, then.
2518 2018-06-30 18:21:42 The rate at which Accra Aca is digging deep... they’ll soon find oil in Accra #NSMQ2018
2519 2018-06-30 18:21:39 From oil, income not available to other states, so how would they copy that?

It's Not from other people's income, then spread out by a group of bureaucrats, as they see fit.
There is no democracy there. It's just heavy taxation.
2520 2018-06-30 18:21:33 Trump calls saudi to boost production..mr president..this is not watertap..this is oil...open up US onshore before its too late..anyway brent is all set to enter 90s..may be tripple digit...MENA oil disruption is serious...one more oil shock is coming...

2524 2018-06-30 18:20:46 People that buy into the oil commodity market should consider the lost value of their home when high gas prices cause another recession or causes our economy to grow less than it otherwise would have. Is it worth it? Invest in something more productive.
2525 2018-06-30 18:20:38 Anyone ever had avocado oil before ?

2532 2018-06-30 18:19:50 Jill Stein also has major investments in Oil.
2533 2018-06-30 18:19:38 How would that help Russia? Everything Trump does somehow advantages Russia & Trump! Does Trump make fortune off it?Will it hurt the EU? Can it hurt USA oil production? And Will it hurt Canada—source of most of the oil USA imports? Trump’s not happy till all others are miserable!

.. 

Aand comes back with some oil from.. somewhere. 

Starts oiling her,
2537 2018-06-30 18:19:26 Trump at least got part of this right — treating Saudi as one big dumb gas station. Having screwed up in Yemen; in Qatar; in Lebanon, let them help keep oil prices stable.
2538 2018-06-30 18:19:24 Likewise. Had friends working in the oil patch spending most of their time sitting in a truck playing on their phones. Fact is, the jobs aren’t coming back and technology with eat more and more jobs until the process is almost entirely automated.
2539 2018-06-30 18:19:20 And haven't the oil fields in America slowed down production...
2540 2018-06-30 18:19:05 Well fuck I guess if you got that much to invest in that kinda vehicle you got the bread to pay for oil changes / maintenance 
2541 2018-06-30 18:19:04 I use regular shampoo on my beard and its fine. The only thing i buy specific for my beard is beard oil. Probably wont ever buy it again tho

2545 2018-06-30 18:18:27 The President of the United States of America is an ill-educated fool. The price of oil is *too high therefore you should switch to electric cars. 
2546 2018-06-30 18:18:25 Really? Are you really "shocked"?  First of all, ironic choice of words... Second of all... I can't help but think that we all didn't expect the oil industry to die without a wimper?... This is but the beginning. It's up to consumers to decide by where they put their money.
2547 2018-06-30 18:18:12 #MSMN certainly looks very interesting at £2m MCAP with 2 licenses producing and the 3rd one flow testing .. Oil heading over $80 makes it even more exciting
2548 2018-06-30 18:18:05 Most prob respond positively bcse they think it's the right thing to say.
Realistically how is my life made better in a tangible way by just having an Asian next door? Am I safer, more econ secure, schools better, healthier, any happier? Makes no diff IMO.
2549 2018-06-30 18:18:03 Also a violation of OPEC treaty and the moron doesn't understand shite about oil economics and ... oh, I just give up. I had a bunion once that was smarter than DJT
2550 2018-06-30 18:18:03 I am a libertarian, free market acolyte, but the Saudis / OPEC are all oil manipulaton anyway. All Trump did was move deck chairs around. The ship is still the Saudi / Opec SS Contrived. Also,hard to believe the Saudis can just say yes & not even appear to check with OPEC/Russia.
2551 2018-06-30 18:17:55 $60 for an oil change? *cries in synthetic oil*
2552 2018-06-30 18:17:47 Fans or area de oil Alan doesn’t everyone describe it as that?

2556 2018-06-30 18:16:52 I’ll be concerned when oil prices get “too” high.

2558 2018-06-30 18:16:40 The oil slick one we had a fight over?  loved that lil guy
2559 2018-06-30 18:16:37 2. This is the first time in 50 years where we have someone that can really get things done. Build refineries, we will make out off gasoline and diesel with our own oil. That ought to really help us control prices and stability.

All your Silicon Valley friends let these people cook and mow their lawns but no one does anything regarding where they are from? But China needs more money? Legislation fixes all this.
2571 2018-06-30 18:15:41 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed! لاتنسى

2574 2018-06-30 18:15:28 Putin didnt want Trump. Since when does Russia want a Republican? #Never Russia is a gas station. ~50% of govt revs are oil EXPORTS. They want US to cut oil prod to zero. THATS DEMOCRATS PLATFORM. Thats OPPOSITE of GOP. You are being lied to because you are superbly gullible.

2577 2018-06-30 18:15:10 Previously, a lot of critical factors influenced the oil price. And, it really consider the market overview (supply, demand, currency, etc)

Today may mark a new era where the oil price can be influenced by just sending a tweet.

@OPECSecretariat @oilpriceupdates
2578 2018-06-30 18:15:07 To be fair, Trump has spoken to King Salman and made an agreement for SA to produce more oil. Prices will go down.
Iran and Venezuela seem to be distracted by other problems at the moment.

2594 2018-06-30 18:12:28 @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, Thank you for taking action to counter the recent unmerited run-up in the price if oil.  I was pleased to read that Saudi Arabia was increasing production.  My prayers are always with you...KAG!
2595 2018-06-30 18:12:25 The amount of money, Nigeria makes yearly from crude oil is more than the amount of money, South Africa makes from it's total exports yearly
2596 2018-06-30 18:12:22 Yes. Nothing in that article changes the fact Putin wants Canada's oil left in the ground. Why did you delete it?
2597 2018-06-30 18:12:21 Do you not see? This is a direct attempt to RAISE the price of oil.  That, and it’s Trump’s first effort to insert himself as a direct influencer of the price from now on.  Watch and see.  Price will only go one way - the way Putin wants it to
2598 2018-06-30 18:12:21 Venezuela is an oil rich country ravaged by socialist policies. By the way you never mentioned "public spending" you posted a ridiculous video by some guy claiming "dollar zombies" cause Venezuela's crisis and blamed on borrowing in foreign currency. Did you actually watch video?
2599 2018-06-30 18:12:20 If electric vehicles succeed and become cheaper, oil industry would die, and so the global banking system will change, monopoly will weaken, they have every reason to do that.
2600 2018-06-30 18:12:19 I would only get that done at a dealer, not the oil change place. Now getting a trans flush every 50k is a good idea.

2610 2018-06-30 18:10:18 Trump said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia's King Salman had agreed to his request to increase oil production "maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels," an extraordinary amount not confirmed by the kingdom and which would push the OPEC leader to a level of production never tested before.

2613 2018-06-30 18:09:55 @FUTURENEWS2020 whats the story with USA asking Saudis to add 2,000,000 barrels of oil production?
2614 2018-06-30 18:09:49 The world is still drunk in oil industries, but not for long
2615 2018-06-30 18:09:26 Oil painting is much more fun and easy than I imagined
2616 2018-06-30 18:09:16 Someone who doesn’t get an oil change often 
2617 2018-06-30 18:09:14 Russia could add as much as 400,000 barrels a day. Aside from the Saudis, are Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq likely to be able to put more oil on the market soon.

2621 2018-06-30 18:08:54 The evil spirit that afflict mineral rich African countries is rearing it head in Turkana. You will be beaten & oil will still be taken
2622 2018-06-30 18:08:47 Did we all just forget when we essentially tortured native Americans over an oil pipeline? Like all this "this isn't the America I know" bullshit. Seems like we have a short collective memory.
2623 2018-06-30 18:08:27 i need an oil change

2626 2018-06-30 18:08:09 Set oil prices to high!
2627 2018-06-30 18:08:06 I use mpl oil... it usually works for me. You can try it.

2629 2018-06-30 18:07:58 @SaratogaOlive obsessed with you lemon balsamic and garlic olive oil. We gave them away as favors at our wedding last year and I’ve been hooked ever since
2630 2018-06-30 18:07:57 But that was half the point after all, wasn't it? Keep oil prices high for his boss, Uncle Putin, and his boys in Saudi so he can go rub their "Pleasure Dome" again.

2631 2018-06-30 18:07:54 As usual our dumb and illiterate media missed the real breaking news: The American oil giant Exxon Mobil enters the Pakistani "oil industry". The "shale revolution" is set to reach Pakistani With 105 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 9.1 billion barrels of shale oil.
2632 2018-06-30 18:07:51 Trump says Saudi King Salman has agreed to raise oil production up to 2 million barrels...Now, as I remember,trump ALSO said N.Korea said they were limiting nuke sites; turns out that they're IMPROVING their facilities..When I hear it from King Salman....
2633 2018-06-30 18:07:45 We should buy Venezuela’s oil...help out the people...
2634 2018-06-30 18:07:29 Did you ever get around to bringing up the little matter of 15 of the 19 highjackers plus OBL being Saudis, while 0 were Iranian, Venezuelan, Iraqi or Afghani, or were you too busy curtsying, selling weapons & buying oil?

Just curious.
2635 2018-06-30 18:07:27 #Saudi & #UAE keeps lying about food assistance to #Yemen , even when they're stealing over 2.5 millions barrels of crude oil,not to mention LPG &LNG exports. That's 150mil $/day we're talking about. Trump &the others get their shares Cash. No wonder no one wants the war to stop.
2636 2018-06-30 18:07:26 THE OIL CURSE HITS KENYA.
The turkana have blocked everything. M7 was thoughtful for once when he refused the oilpipeline there.
2637 2018-06-30 18:07:07 You don’t understand much about oil drilling do you?   Neither does Trump, obviously.
2638 2018-06-30 18:06:59 Wow. They really live in a fantasy world. It’s incredible to watch everyday.
2639 2018-06-30 18:06:58 When AT&T, or Shell Oil, or any of the big businesses fill out their tax returns on a postcard, then it will be great news. Until them it's a sham.
2640 2018-06-30 18:06:53 So You think it's better to buy expensive oil, than support alternetive energy science. Bright, You are not.

2642 2018-06-30 18:06:49 Not to mention canola meal is a byproduct of making canola oil for cooking
2643 2018-06-30 18:06:44 And hence made India agree upon reducing import from Iran...Clear now. Mean India also negotiated well and clarified it's concern over high oil prices. Good
2644 2018-06-30 18:06:43 Gikomba fire tragedy .
Boda guys v matatu guys fight in kisumu 
Guys In turkana are fighting against the oil project .
2645 2018-06-30 18:06:39 I just bought a new phone, then looked down and saw I needed an oil change  Taking L’s all summer ‘18
2646 2018-06-30 18:06:35 They had already decided to do this So again has nothing to do with you. Better watch out,consumers like low gas prices but your big $ oil men don't so good luck balancing that.
2647 2018-06-30 18:06:23 my gf is gone and i too am getting an oil change what is this
2648 2018-06-30 18:06:22 There’s a common, but I think incorrect, view that the bergamot oil will curdle the milk. But I’ve never seen this happen. It’s more that the citrus based flavour doesn’t suit the mill texture. Try it with a squeeze of lemon and sugar and see what you think.
2649 2018-06-30 18:06:21 Scott, OIL pays every Alaskan a yearly wage, without it many could not live there. Small sample size, not socialism.
Alaska is not an example of anything to compare to the lower 48. That's a statistical outlier.
2650 2018-06-30 18:06:21 :(((((( ugh, that sucks. Have you tried lanolin oil? I put some on my lips every night and it pretty much saved them
2651 2018-06-30 18:06:16 how can we trust Saudi for oil production? they are hardcore Indian enemy.
2652 2018-06-30 18:06:07 @POTUS If americans want rid of  <t> we will take him on conditions serves his jail term here. We will send him west to work oil fields or Cenral Canada work in the woods and last NFLD to the fishing grounds. PS send large supply of diapers .
2653 2018-06-30 18:05:51 He wouldn’t want oil from Iran, they’re not lining him and his families pockets. They also didn’t interfere in our election and try to get Trump elected.
2654 2018-06-30 18:05:41 Thought we are the leader now?
Why are we exporting oil?
2655 2018-06-30 18:05:36 @deborahskyrim is commenting on Canadian oil so I’m ASSUMING that is what she is protesting. Why else would she be on this thread ??This could just be My Native American Intuition. The fact is the World can’t run 100% on renewable energy today, but we are working towards it
2656 2018-06-30 18:05:34 “do you have moroccan oil at your store” 
“no” 
“yes you do i swore i saw it there”
“no, sorry. maybe it was at cosmoprof?”
“wait who is this”
“SalonCentric”
*hangs up*
2657 2018-06-30 18:05:19 I know they know I’m not paying for this oil change. 4 hours of my Saturday in this dealership. I might swing in the cashier if he doesn’t just hand me my keys

2659 2018-06-30 18:05:05 @trailerparkboys @SWEARNET Hey - since weed's gonna be legal in CAN, you guys have any plans for Ricky branded weed products? e.g., Ricky's Honey Oil, Hash Coins (make 'em weed infused chocolate in lieu of real hash!), 5 hr. De-Energy, etc.?
2660 2018-06-30 18:05:01 Maybe Trump shouldn't have destabilized oil prices by violating Iran deal. High gas prices are on Trump. Reap what you sow.
2661 2018-06-30 18:04:48 hmm lagi satu now that i’ve tried biore & hada labo punya cleansing oil, i think i like biore more? i cant exactly point out why 
2662 2018-06-30 18:04:41 MCT oil is surprisingly pleasant in taste.  Breaking the fast o'clock has arrived.
Now for some broth.  
My stomach seems to be surprised lol.
2663 2018-06-30 18:04:29 US is in itself such a big oil producer & it still has to beg the Saudis to lower prices?
2664 2018-06-30 18:04:14 Before the discovery of petrol, whale oil was used for lighting, cooking, and machine lubrication.
2665 2018-06-30 18:04:05 why not increase American oil production?
2666 2018-06-30 18:03:54 We buy $150,000,000 a day in oil and export what to make it "fair trade"? #NoWall
2667 2018-06-30 18:03:46 Got ‘em! 
2668 2018-06-30 18:03:46 Candy had a 8 am appointment to get a oil change for the car & there’s still 4 people ahead of her
2669 2018-06-30 18:03:37 We were talking about TB, UK identity, Oil & potential of Indy2 in this thread?
Healthy debate right up until you told me to “fuck off”
I would never address anyone on here in a way that I wouldn’t be willing to do in person.
I wouldn’t dream of saying that 2 you.
Thats a shame.
2670 2018-06-30 18:03:22 Trump will make the US a great Trade Deal! Including gas & oil!
2671 2018-06-30 18:03:18 I am a strong independent woman but I also would not mind if someone wanted to take my car and get my oil changed and answer the mechanics questions for the rest of my life.
2672 2018-06-30 18:03:15 -Eat food which are rich in vitamin E and protein
-Use silk pillow cases
-Have your hair in braids while sleeping
-Don’t wash your hair everyday
-Use frizz-taming mousse/serum/oil/spray or other hair products
-Leave in your conditioner for a longer time (3-5 mins)
2673 2018-06-30 18:03:14 "Hustled" has several meanings.  Selling snake oil comes to mind
2674 2018-06-30 18:03:13 Hey who give everybody oil can BOYD, thats right, he,s very underated, but dude can pitch
2675 2018-06-30 18:03:12 They already said they were going to increase oil production.
2676 2018-06-30 18:03:10 Strange. Gearbox main shaft oil seal?
2677 2018-06-30 18:03:08 So what property are you getting to overpay a single supplier of oil? Too bad we weren’t less dependent on oil —- oh wait we were before you took over. 
2678 2018-06-30 18:03:08 Should a Christian vote for a person who supports abortion but hates War or for his opponent who hates abortion but sees nothing wrong with sending our boys to fight and die and slaughter for Big Oil?

2680 2018-06-30 18:02:48 My gf told me something last night that stuck to me she said “ People pray for cake, but when the almighty gives them eggs, oil, butter, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen” so with that being said just trust the process!
2681 2018-06-30 18:02:43 i just burnt myself w hot oil i wanna die
2682 2018-06-30 18:02:43 Oil isn't free*

2684 2018-06-30 18:02:37 Mmmmm tzatziki. I've been tying not to count weeks before I, once again, set foot in Rethymnon. Cretan tzatziki is the best I've tasted.Very simple. Yohgurt, oil & garlic. No cucumber or mint. Lovely. Easy to mix at home.

2688 2018-06-30 18:02:22 Girl go Debe market and get some fresh coconut oil.

2691 2018-06-30 18:02:11 Face wash and blemish gel from Body shop. I also purchased a jar of tea tree oil from Amazon.
2692 2018-06-30 18:02:07 They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and...
2693 2018-06-30 18:01:56 Genie Energy was granted exclusive oil and gas exploration rights to a 153-square mile radius in the southern part of the Golan Heights.
2694 2018-06-30 18:01:33 thats not my fault dude hmpf,, stop dying and you can stop going to jail
2695 2018-06-30 18:01:29 It's a UK registered oil company, traded in London. Prime Minister of Congo has very little power in this game. The oil company pays and supplies weapons to the rebels in the region, Congo Gov wants to avoid another civil war.
2696 2018-06-30 18:01:20 Oil longs be like "Thank Goodness CME contracts are every 30 days LOL"
2697 2018-06-30 18:01:20 They haven't cut oil regulations inland.  They've cut offshore regulations.  ND is at the center of the continent.

They are hiring again, and they will fire again.  Oil isn't sustainable, and the GOP has wasted any and all funding allocated to renewable power options in ND.
2698 2018-06-30 18:01:20 Why don’t you stop all the North Dakota Oil from being shipped off shore?  Yes, all that oil is being sent away. There’s no oil shortage in USA, there is a glut. Anyone can fact check this but Trump. The oil in N Dakota can sell more off shore than in USA. High prices are on Don
2699 2018-06-30 18:01:01 Thieves oil is my best friend. I’m hoping and wishing my itchy throat doesn’t progress into anything.
2700 2018-06-30 18:00:58 hmmm....what would the oil/gas companies say if everyone in the country were to NOT use the pumps for oil/gas/diesel for 1 day...only 1 day?? RT if yall wanna see this and if you RT this, fill your cars or trucks up today and leave the pumps ALONE tomorrow    RT!!!!!
2701 2018-06-30 18:00:47 Oh it's just a bit sour. Whenever it expires I just season it with olive oil and it's good to go. Sometimes I let it dry and it becomes like normal cheese
2702 2018-06-30 18:00:30 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
2703 2018-06-30 18:00:25 Yes, pressure the oil company and especially the UK Government (it's registered on the London Stock Exchange). Congo Gov. has very limited power in the Eastern Provinces. Also, watch the movie.
2704 2018-06-30 18:00:21 That was yesterday's FAKE PHONE CALL
Today he pretended to have called the Saudi King to manipulate oil prices. FAKE PHONE CALL

Seems the only phone calls he actually has are with FAKE Senators
2705 2018-06-30 18:00:09 Blackwater mercenary/military contractor has a whole private airline and an airstrip inside a ranch 40 minutes  via chopper from the oil wells. You have not seen these 'private military contractors.' Forget KDF na Recce squad. These are killing machines lurking around us.
2706 2018-06-30 18:00:09 I’ve: got my oil changed, my hair cut, gone grocery shopping and have started a load of laundry. Busy today, lazy tomorrow.

#charlatan #hypocrite
2710 2018-06-30 17:59:50 Why don’t you call all of our oil companies and ask them to lower their profit margins and help lower prices. Our poor, fixed income and lower middle class families are having such a tough time just affording to get to work! Profit is ok but on the backs of the poor isn’t!
2711 2018-06-30 17:59:44 The oil of God makes the difference and challenges are for those who are going some where in LIFE.
2712 2018-06-30 17:59:41 Thanks for this true thread! I’m PhD engineer (UIUC-state school but elite engineering program). when I started 5 of 7 major oil co’s CEOs were UIUC engineers. now all big corps are run by HBS MBS etc grads who serve only themselves and top 1%. As in law, NOT a good thing for USA
2713 2018-06-30 17:59:31 But lower oil prices will hurt your BFF Putin. He’s gonna be mad at you!!! Better get on the phone and apologize to him
2714 2018-06-30 17:59:26 The mental gymnastics you do, and the cognitive dissonance you get from being a liberal Trump supporter might be tough, but selling snake oil to Trump supporters is easy. I mean wasn't there a blank book about Democrats that was the number 1 best seller on Amazon? Yeah, easy.
2715 2018-06-30 17:59:20 You do realize that an increase in production also hurts #American oil producers!  Please someone explain #economics to our @POTUS

2724 2018-06-30 17:58:56 I pour a bit of olive oil in pasta or noodles if I make a stir fry. Keeps it from drying out.
2725 2018-06-30 17:58:53 Today I decided I was going to be an adult & wear sunscreen. When I went to lay out I put on what I thought was sunscreen. 2 hours later my dad says “Alyssa you’re red as shit” 
I checked the sunscreen & realized it was 10SPF tanning oil wtf 
2726 2018-06-30 17:58:46 I just got coconut oil in my eye and I’m pretty sure I just reversed my LASIK.
2727 2018-06-30 17:58:44 I love #myPresident and part of his success is responding to things quickly and as we know Oil can have instant reactions. Tweet, Cabinet Announcements, SPR?, Export ban? etc.....
2728 2018-06-30 17:58:36 จะตายแล้ว...
2729 2018-06-30 17:58:35 Lol "data is the new oil" hell yeah
2730 2018-06-30 17:58:25 Maybe read the beginning convo. Did Trump call? Yes he did. Paragraph 6. She then switched convo to Iran oil, because, no one reads past the first para, do they?
2731 2018-06-30 17:58:20 have a more unique way of doing eggs. use a stainless steel quality pan. use olive oil. turn it up rather high. add eggs and stir constantly. they're done in like 2 min and the pan stays totally clean.

2755 2018-06-30 17:55:59 For years i have wondered why,during times of famine and unrest and countries on their knees why the FUCK is oil so important.
2756 2018-06-30 17:55:49 Need to wash this heart of mine with engine oil

2759 2018-06-30 17:55:42 This morning Trump tweeted that he had convinced Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production up to 2 million barrels.  Doing so would break OPEC rules.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

But go ahead, swallow some more.
2760 2018-06-30 17:55:40 Reuters 6/30/218
Trump says Saudi king agreed to raise oil output by up to 2 million barrels
 
"The statement reported by Saudi media did not mention any intention by Saudi Arabia to raise production by 2 million barrels per day."

So, at best you are just hoping, eh Mr. Trump?
2761 2018-06-30 17:55:37 I saw that too! Olive oil isn't something I use too often. I still have some. Thanks for the heads up!
2762 2018-06-30 17:55:33 Haters, oil your own machines - if you really have one! ;)

2768 2018-06-30 17:54:57 This might not be what you guys are looking for but CBD oil can really help with anxiety. I know a couple of people who put it in their tea/coffee/water and really like it

2770 2018-06-30 17:54:54 Peel the potato and grade it. Then squeeze the juice and mix it with olive oil. Try it for a few days that way you won’t spend money on going to the hospital. Worth a try.
2771 2018-06-30 17:54:52 Did u ever change her oil bc if not I take it back
2772 2018-06-30 17:54:41 But I think Bashir wants SS oil more than the Troika. Worth noting how even France is not openly engaged despite Total having some of the largest  blocs in Jonglei!
2773 2018-06-30 17:54:15 It was on sale for .99 so you can see why I just could not pass it up.  BTW on this subject of frugality Giant Tiger of all places has Aurora extra virgin olive oil cold pressed for $2 off the regular price.

2780 2018-06-30 17:53:48 That's just a bad time waiting to happen. A friend in TX was so upset over being laid off that he skidded on wet oil on the highway, laid his bike down, and got hurt pretty badly. Had full leathers and helmet on too.

2783 2018-06-30 17:53:08 Trump claims Saudi Arabia has agreed to boost oil production amid turmoil | guardian
2784 2018-06-30 17:53:07 The President tweeted that he had convinced Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production up to 2 million barrels.  
Doing so would break OPEC rules.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

At least he tried.
2785 2018-06-30 17:53:07 It’s available now, at the very first experiments for e-cigarettes resulted in serious injuries.
#Oil is our catastrophe
2786 2018-06-30 17:53:05 So... what your headline should have been...

Trump lies again, this time about oil prices.
2787 2018-06-30 17:53:03 Why not buy our oil from russia?  It's where we got our president.
2788 2018-06-30 17:53:00 20 drops lemon eucalyptus oil in 4oz water.  Shake before applying.  You will smell lemony, better than deet?
I also use gerainium oil 10 drops, but not abs. Necessary.
2789 2018-06-30 17:52:53 More FAKE NEWS. That is why oil keeps going up.  They are cutting production you twit
2790 2018-06-30 17:52:49 Can you show us the document that King Salman of Saudi Arabia signed agreeing to increase oil production? No. Then you are as usual full of shit.
2791 2018-06-30 17:52:38 Oil change is my worst adulting chore!
2792 2018-06-30 17:52:23 From the wsj. "A senior Saudi official said the kingdom has made no specific promise to President Trump but rather assured the U.S. of its capability to meet oil demand."

2802 2018-06-30 17:51:36 My mom had a kidney stone and it was awful! A lady told her to drink a spoon of olive oil and potato juice every morning before breakfast for 10 days. She did it and got better. She didn’t do it for 10 days because she said it was disgusting so she stoped like at day 5.
2803 2018-06-30 17:51:33 Plus the Saudis are nearly out of oil. They are NOT going to increase production. They have been at max for a while now. Do you really want us to believe there is a shortage when we are EXPORTING oil?
2804 2018-06-30 17:51:19 What ever happened to energy independence!  You know, drill, baby drill.  You know Iranian oil could fill the void too!  You know trading with Iran might actually bring them into the world of nations and modify their behavior.  
2805 2018-06-30 17:51:17 The people of Alberta. They have no interest in governing. Just in letting oil industry do whatever it wants and cracking down on descent.
2806 2018-06-30 17:51:11 To b a good activist, it helps if u don't keep track of things... like the prediction of peak oil in 1976.

2812 2018-06-30 17:50:45 Ruling party is not focused on rupee instead they have already bowed to US ($). Forced India to back out from Iran in oil purchase.

2819 2018-06-30 17:50:18 A higher price of oil should benefit the already stressed Saudi economy. Why would he want to increase oil production to lower it :/
2820 2018-06-30 17:50:14 Lots of people make their own cannabis oil to treat cancer. Lots of people use natural remedies for lots of ailments. They don't only become medicines when they are manufactured and administered by a doctor or a chemist
2821 2018-06-30 17:50:13 And rolls over for Kim Jong un and Putin. Oh and check the actual time line regarding production for barrels of oil. Trump had nothing to do with increased production. Nothing.
2822 2018-06-30 17:50:13 So Trump wants to tank the oil business in the US so we are dependent on foreign oil again? It cost oil producers 50 bucks to produce 1 barrel of oil. It will also put 10s of thousands of people out of work again. #fucktrump

2844 2018-06-30 17:47:50 Because they are an ally.  Plus I’d think you find that the US Gov., funded the early stages of Al Quada. The Afghan Freedom Fighters that Reagan loved so much. Probably also a back room deal to keep the oil flowing.

2847 2018-06-30 17:46:52 So he gets to sell 2 million more barrels of oil at the current high price?

Magnanimous.
2848 2018-06-30 17:46:42 Gee, I wonder who caused all the turmoil in Iran that’s causing oil prices to spike? And it’s “too” not “to”, President Grammar Dolt.
2849 2018-06-30 17:46:36 Usually no coating - just tossed with a bit of olive oil and herbs, but I have done potato croquettes which turned out great.  I don’t really make anything battered so I’m not sure how that would hold up.

2911 2018-06-30 17:40:37 the furries are leveling your unsoldierly oil geologist
2912 2018-06-30 17:40:36 Oh so right. I guess trashing the economy, and thus demand, is one way to bring down oil prices.
2913 2018-06-30 17:40:29 YAY Foreign Oil!
2914 2018-06-30 17:40:28 Policy from the @POTUS is anti-business! He disrupts planning, international trade, and org behavior. He has intentionally driven up the price of oil and he is more than happy to trash independent monetary policy. Maria will not confront the unfit, malignant @POTUS lies.
2915 2018-06-30 17:40:27 He probably thought that just him floating out some bs would drive down the price of oil. You know, on a Saturday, when markets are closed
2916 2018-06-30 17:40:24 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2927 2018-06-30 17:39:23 Sarah ngan kak Iman ada cakap yang oil cleanser ni mungkin ada yg tak sesuai dgn skin kita. So kena try and error. Maybe your skin tak boleh dgn olive oil(hada labo), mineral oil(biore) if I'm not mistaken. Baca balik okay  I pun dah try banyak product yang they suggest.
2928 2018-06-30 17:39:15 I believe AB’s energy is among the most responsible anywhere. I believe it is wrong for Canada to import oil from less responsible nations. I believe anti-oil eco-nuts are being fed lies from our foreign competitors and are hypocrites when they use energy products they vilify.
2929 2018-06-30 17:39:06 Bankruptcy Don is now personally pulling the strings on the world markets. Whether it’s oil, tariffs, or trade deals, why are we trusting a reality-tv host with our economic welfare?
2930 2018-06-30 17:39:02 Wasn't using turpentine, so I didn't need any ventilation. The paint didn't smell any weirder than my acrylic lol. Oil paint, in itself, is fine from what I'm reading, it's the stuff you add to it.
2931 2018-06-30 17:38:53 Also, I got my truck back.  Oil change and new tires as requested not done, but after a month just givw me my fucking truck and let me go.
2932 2018-06-30 17:38:48 Or to think like some of the peak oil folks: It will come back on August 1, 2029 at 1530.
2933 2018-06-30 17:38:48 No he wasn't. He made clear that oil was a bonus. You need to stop reading the shite pumped out by the MSM. And the idea that we'd lose trade with England is ridiculous. You need our water & energy as well as our food.
2934 2018-06-30 17:38:30 well the oil sector is miniscule in comparesment to other private sectors, furthemore it was not chavez who nationalised the oil industry but carlos andreas perres in 1976
2935 2018-06-30 17:38:16 First, proof read your tweets. What did trump give up for Saudi Arabia to maybe increase oil production. Trump does not speak about gas prices now (much lower under Obama!).
2936 2018-06-30 17:38:14 Heck when we were younger we all had jobs in high school so we could buy our Copenhagen and Wiser’s for the weekends. Then once school was over we either go into forestry or drill for natural gas and oil. I took the oil route...
2937 2018-06-30 17:38:12 The Saudi Arabia King had agreed to doubling oil production @OPEC meeting. Even #Iran agreed to double their production, but with the fear of Iran's inability to supply to international markets when the economic sanctions become effective, #Saudi Arabia has that burden
2938 2018-06-30 17:38:10 Keep your day job. Humor and you - oil and water.
2939 2018-06-30 17:37:44 LOL, This is amazing... Trump supporters who scream against globalization will champion this too. Meanwhile, as oil prices go down, domestic oil employment will take the hit.
2940 2018-06-30 17:37:44 Yeah, I think it was rebranded here in the 80s or 90s so folks wouldn't have to say "rape" when discussing cooking oil!
2941 2018-06-30 17:37:42 "increase oil production, maybe up to 2m barrels". If Saudi increases by 1 barrel, they have adhered to the agreement.
2942 2018-06-30 17:37:21 Just an oil change
2943 2018-06-30 17:37:11 i use the salt and water thing + tea tree oil and it comes back still  i ain’t takin out my piercing tho
2944 2018-06-30 17:37:08 We should not depend so much on oil. There are good alternatives
2945 2018-06-30 17:37:07 Yup. He watered it down by adding N Korea and Venezuela. He’s not going to hinder our relationship with the Saudies. We have too much invested with the. Oil for starters.

2949 2018-06-30 17:36:37 PRICE OF OIL YESTERDAY 6/29 WAS CLOSE TO 75.00 A BARREL . SEEMS THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE SPECULATORS DRIVING THE PRICE UP SO THEY CAN PROFIT !!!!
2950 2018-06-30 17:36:29 I can't eat anything with peanut butter it makes me go into the hospital. Plus I can't eat anything cooked with peanut oil.
2951 2018-06-30 17:36:20 The IEA is a political organization,  controlled by consumers of oil not so much producers who pay the bill,  U.S and Japan primarily.  Healthy to be a little more than cynical about what they tell us.   A history of underestimating demand, over estimating supply and capacity.

2956 2018-06-30 17:35:47 BREAKING: This morning the President tweeted that he had convinced Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production up to 2 million barrels.  Doing so would break OPEC rules.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

SURPRISE, SURPRISE!
2957 2018-06-30 17:35:32 Agree, but couldn’t we release from oil reserve to drop the price? Just wondering. Interesting to see if Allies will stop buying from Iran. Even more will be what will China and Russia do.  It is a crazy world and seems to be going nuts

2959 2018-06-30 17:35:29 All three have small populations with homogeneous culture and much of it supported by oil. Still, they can't afford homes of their own, pay above 40% in taxes and still lack income equality.
2960 2018-06-30 17:35:26 Lord, I humbly ask that you heal us from any hurt, shame, sickness and guilt. Heal our hearts O Lord God. Give us beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and let us wear the garment of praise instead of the spirit of heaviness and burden. Amen.

2965 2018-06-30 17:35:11 Agreed, Samatha. Although, his tariffs and other economic inanities will tend to bring oil prices down as trade and economies collapse.
2966 2018-06-30 17:35:08 Wrong , i think the highest was about 10.6 now 10.14 aramco said they can reach to 12.5m also saudi already agreed to increase oil production in OPEC summit

2971 2018-06-30 17:34:39 The Venezuelan private sector has been decimated. Shortages on all fronts. 95% of Venezuela’s revenue is government owned oil and Maduro has run PDVSA into the ground. What the hell are you trying to prove Matus? Is there any upside in Marxist regimes? Any communist upside?
2972 2018-06-30 17:34:34 We as a species rely on oil way too much. Why aren't we looking at alternatives or renewables?

2980 2018-06-30 17:34:03 We need relief at the gas pumps. Why can’t we increase our oil production and processing?  Gas used to be a $1.13. What the heck is going on?  Everyday Americans, truckers can not afford this fleecing!  It’s almost $5 now. Money does not grow on trees!

Almost never is the tadka done first, then fry tomatoes with oil and cook through, then add rasam podi and pepper. Then add dal water and finally raw mango pulp. Almost completely
2991 2018-06-30 17:32:45 So @Tsepish comes to me today about a clearance sale at Hobby Lobby on some higher end art supplies.  OTOH ... cheap art supplies on the other hand fuck Hobby Lobby.  I’m going to reconcile this by hoping they’re taking a loss. I do need to pick up some series 4 pigments in oil.

2996 2018-06-30 17:32:02 Commercial inventories at a 5 yr average,  however the oil in process is much greater than in the past.  Larger inventories are required just to meet refinery/commercial demand today.  That is going to be a factor not recognized by the market early on as supplies tighten.
2997 2018-06-30 17:32:02 Solar power is mostly used or publicized for use in heating or electricity generation, oil isn’t used in electricity generation (less than 0.7% of US electricity is generated from petroleum) but has other uses, that’s what I meant.

3001 2018-06-30 17:31:44 The oil crescent situation has certainly exposed a LOT of hidden truths about #Libya's crisis.

Libyans are watching as their supposedly Libyan-led, UN brokered political process reveals its true colours. A western led political sham with UN for optics & Libyans as cannon fodder.
3002 2018-06-30 17:31:39 Thanks to King Salman and to you President Trump.  That should help to lower the price of gas in the USA.  Also in case we or King Salmon needed oil for our ships or planes we would have it.

3010 2018-06-30 17:30:51 The middle-eastern oil runs on double-hulled ships as well but ones that are registered in places like Liberia where the regs are much less strict so the ships are less well-equipped, less well-crewed and less well-maintained.

3025 2018-06-30 17:29:29 This is why Holland & Barrett are selling CBD oil as a 'food supplement' (probably in breach of #PSAct, but who expects logic in this policy field?)
3026 2018-06-30 17:29:28 To my knowledge there are no single-hulled tankers running out of US or Canadian ports. The issue right now is that the Alaskan oil fields are drying up and have to be replaced with other sources. If not Canadian crude then either oil-by-rail or middle-eastern oil 1/
3027 2018-06-30 17:29:28 Tell me why my coworker just paid for ms schissler’s oil change
3028 2018-06-30 17:29:27 Did he sign a contract? The Saudis have been controlling oil production and prices for decades and as in the past will increase or decrease at THEIR discretion, not YOURS.
3029 2018-06-30 17:29:24 You know as well as I know, main stream media paints a very different picture of the situation than in fact exists. Important to understand the power of oil industry on govt and media.
3030 2018-06-30 17:29:22 U.S dollars are at the heart of the worlds financial system,  U.S. has the largest consumer market , the strongest military and big oil production and some wonder how Trump will enforce an Iran embargo? Carrot and stick.
3031 2018-06-30 17:29:17 Actually, all major oil producers are happy to replace Iran. Even India announced they won't be buying Iran oil! China also hesitant to replace Total. Nightmare for regime.
3032 2018-06-30 17:29:16 Senator, you meet with the Prez almost every week. You could tell him..... that your campaign contributions are suffering because of that. By the way.... Oil & gas, mortal enemies of wind and solar.

3040 2018-06-30 17:28:26 I think teaching creationism wouldn't be a big deal for half the country.  They resent color, tolerance, anyone who threatens them or whoever is scapegoated to look threatening to them. They don't understand or see that they are being scammed by a world class snake oil salesman.

3044 2018-06-30 17:27:42 So we will become a oil dependent country again?  Under President Obama we were no longer dependent on foreign oil.. Huge set back for the USA.

3047 2018-06-30 17:27:27 Inclined to agree 98 percent of the time, but the two percent of the time where they're cooked together with the chorizo and soak up that oil...
3048 2018-06-30 17:27:22 Virunga is a national reserve. The movie/documentary frm frw yrs back felt big oil was behind the instability & murders in area. Virunga was protected!  Looks like documentary was right. LeoDecaprio bankrolled movie. Well done. See it when it's back on Netflix.

3054 2018-06-30 17:27:06 What about our country's oil production???
3055 2018-06-30 17:27:04 In 1962 when I was 3 1/2 my buddy Kippy and I decided to dig for oil in my back yard. We found it.  We hit the line from the oil tank in the garage to the house furnace.  I think my dad was 50 before he thought it was funny.
3056 2018-06-30 17:26:58 hayst hope oil
3057 2018-06-30 17:26:55 So, you read a tweet saying we are going to increase our reliance on foreign oil and immediately think about how America is great again?  That’s a weird train of thought. Kind of like, there’s a racist misogynistic douchebag - let’s make him president!
3058 2018-06-30 17:26:48 Such a tool. The grifter is the reason oil prices are so high.

3062 2018-06-30 17:26:32 I could not agree with you more - this is not just about oil. I don't know about you but the redrawing of the lines is pretty alarming. Positioning himself as an influencer is laughable.
3063 2018-06-30 17:26:30 Don't be insulted. Albertans are lead to believe through govt &a media that pollution isn't bad & it is by design. When I lived there speaking openly about the horrific pollution caused by the oil industry was akin to taking you life in your own hands. Propaganda rules in AB.
3064 2018-06-30 17:26:25 Probably from Russia who's only real export is oil...
3065 2018-06-30 17:26:23 “I’m bringing my oil to yours tonight... fancy that. How fortunate.”
3066 2018-06-30 17:26:17 Let’s figure out how to move our oil to the markets better instead.
3067 2018-06-30 17:26:12 President Trump is worried about high oil prices and claims to have persuaded Saudi Arabia to increase production. Yes, higher oil prices are a burden on industry and consumers, but higher oil prices also tend to promote energy efficiency and diversity.
3068 2018-06-30 17:26:02 When are all you global warming lovers going to wake up? Global warming maybe real, but shutting down the coal and oil industry is not the answer. The market will move to other energy sources as they become more affordable. Focus on that.
3069 2018-06-30 17:25:58 I'm not adverse to Jesse w/27 as long as Draisaitl is the pivot. I agree with you in terms of him playing w/Strome.Ik they had some good moments together vs 3L comp,but to your point it's not a good match in the long term IMO.
3070 2018-06-30 17:25:55 I know, right? But we keep at it. Sprinkle olive oil and rough grate very young pecorino over. 
3071 2018-06-30 17:25:54 I believe I've done sufficient research in the topic and will now be reporting my findings. Christan baptism involves public humiliation, involuntary hair cutting, getting covered in lubricant oil, and drowning.
3072 2018-06-30 17:25:50 Iran has been sanctioned by Trump. That's why Oil price has gone up. And now trump is ordering other countries to produce more.
3073 2018-06-30 17:25:40 One of the heathens I live with shoved a 4L jug of vegetable oil in the freezer and I’m like ???? Why???
3074 2018-06-30 17:25:37 My husband moisturises with coconut oil for my approval - and for comfort! One of those please yourself tasks!
3075 2018-06-30 17:25:14 8 day old news from opec meeting, saudis agreed to “measured “ increases at behest of other oil producers including your Russian colleagues
3076 2018-06-30 17:25:13 It definitely cannot replace oil (at least not until super capacitor technology improves), but it can offset how much is used, the issue is that even before the tariffs, it was too expensive to offset its cost when you take into account supporting hardware and maintenance.

3085 2018-06-30 17:23:55 Okay, I'll play.  

When an oil tanker or cargo ship enters the Port of Houston, the captain of said vessel relinquishes control of the vessel to a Port of Houston captain for steerage through the ship channel and the docking of said vessel.

Betcha didn't know that.
3086 2018-06-30 17:23:45 Dude, you don't understand oil or it's business. America has people who do, use them. FYI They even have summits over thus and use reserves.  this was stupid. Please stop 
3087 2018-06-30 17:23:39 It's a monopoly. I liken it to Marathon oil being the only fuel supplier here in Louisville, which means they control the price.
3088 2018-06-30 17:23:36 Middle school was @Jaydeen_Ariana & I listening to sleeping with sirens while hanging upside down, massaging coconut oil into our scalps to try to get longer hair anyone else?
3089 2018-06-30 17:23:36 Its been sold before as a normal small BBQ. They've just rebranded it as vegan, as the size is perfect for veggie skewers etc. If you finding the skewers get stuck, before cooking soak half a chopped onion in oil and then brush the grates with it just before you put them on
3090 2018-06-30 17:23:11 Why aren’t we just building infrastructure to get the oil we are producing to markets instead of worrying what Saudi Arabia is doing?  Wouldn’t that creat jobs and allow us to buy our own oil?

US #18/75.7
Norway #23/74.3
Norway really only underscores the US due to government spending of oil money. It outscores us on property rights.
3092 2018-06-30 17:23:01 You can smell the fear in the markets. We’ve been riding up the roller coaster since 2009 and with such huge disruptions in the world economy recently, we’re all getting ourselves steeled for the inevitable. Did you catch The Donald begging the Saudis for oil? Enjoy the ride!
3093 2018-06-30 17:23:00 Tax breaks don’t have to be given out to multi-billion $ corporations. Especially when the citizens of AB are only getting a few cents on a barrel of oil. What a farce.

3105 2018-06-30 17:20:54 Trump is solely responsible for escalating oil prices (causing undue hardship on the American people) for unjustly reneging on our nation's "Iran nuclear deal" monitored/inspected by the IAEA. Your belligerence has isolated us from the rest of the world. #PutinsPuppet

I suspect many voted Remain out of the exact ignorance of the EU they attributed to Leavers. No matter, the Tories are keeping us in via the backdoor.
3115 2018-06-30 17:20:11 Noting that 'fucking up other countries' was one of the driving motivations behind our oil boom - even aside from the US's usual model of 'make sure the rich people get richer'.

3132 2018-06-30 17:18:40 Socialism doesn't require you to have a mono-economy built on oil, though. That's just what Venezuela happened to have, and when the US oil industry erupted, they were one of the economies that got fucked up - one of many, which includes social systems of all kinds.
3133 2018-06-30 17:18:27 Trump should insist that Putin leave the Crimea. Putin will agree. Trump will diminish sanctions considerably, the Ruble will go up in value. Investment in oil and gas will increase and Putin will have more hard currency for military expenditures. Does this go well for US?.
3134 2018-06-30 17:18:17 It’s most certainly is not a game @BlairKing_ca ! You create a narrative that supports oil tankers and ecological disasters and then you back peddle as fast as you can when one thing you say, goes against another. Like this!

3177 2018-06-30 17:12:19 Increase production - drive down prices - free-up mkt for Russian oil - finance RU arctic oil and Ukraine nat. gas - build pipelines - 10's of billions for Exxon - crush Venezuela.

Sanctions and SEC oversight would prevent this. 

Trump and Repub House & Senate are enabling it.
3178 2018-06-30 17:12:18 If anybody wants some free tanning oil, just come to Lagrange ShopRite and touch my fleece because it’s literally covered in it.
3179 2018-06-30 17:12:11 The NDP strategy IS winning. Eliminate oil and gas.
3180 2018-06-30 17:12:09 Woke, the u.s. needed a scapegoat to stabilize oil prices across the economy. The middle easy was a vibrant progressive society until western greed turned it to fundamental extremists. When god said greed was bad, this is what it leads too.
3181 2018-06-30 17:11:47 It'll be lucky if it stays on anyone's skin with that much oil in it! Lol 
3182 2018-06-30 17:11:45 You’d better ask him to witdraw finances of his terrorists in Syria and you withdraw your troops so Syria can kick out ISIS and start pumping oil again. Btw Venezuela is coz US is sanctioning (swift) them to poverty
3183 2018-06-30 17:11:36 Why scientists are not using the process of photosynthesis as a source of power for the whole human civilisation why they are using coal, oil which cant be remake @neiltyson
3184 2018-06-30 17:11:29 The system was already there ! They just continued as b4 ! Do you know that the GNC don't pay 4 wages or treatment to cancer patients in the east or south where most Libyan oil is from !

3191 2018-06-30 17:10:35 Govt is not so serious to control prices of Oil, Diesel & Gas.

3193 2018-06-30 17:10:21 Dumb mother fucker...drove two hours to get his diesel oil change and fuel filters..and since he drove ALL the way here we had to take him on..cutting into my Saturday family time #Dumb #FML

3195 2018-06-30 17:10:06 Endless oil story
3196 2018-06-30 17:10:03 Oh what a funny headline: if @realDonaldTrump @POTUS can understand and explain oil production targets, I will buy him a family meal from @kfc , even hand delivered to Air Force One. What a good laugh  
3197 2018-06-30 17:09:59 Nah... we dont have any oil 
3198 2018-06-30 17:09:44 The Moroccan oil always used to make me think of chocolate
3199 2018-06-30 17:09:43 #Libyan  Misrati HoR members canceled the planed visit to France  after the #US ambassador #Stifani visited Misrata.
We will not share or oil with frogs , we are already sharing it with the eagle .
3200 2018-06-30 17:09:35 Well of course he did, he's returning the favor you've done for the Oil Industry by shutting down clean energy! Even though every indication is that clean energy grows economies and slows climate change!
3201 2018-06-30 17:09:28 Showing up to the party with a two-liter of olive oil, drinking it out of the bottle
3202 2018-06-30 17:09:22 Q: Why would #Trump ask Saudia for more oil when the US is supposed to be 'energy independent'? 

A: Because the idea of US energy independence is a scam. 

Not likely Saudis have any more capacity, either.
3203 2018-06-30 17:09:18 Trump Putin aren’t eyeing Europe they are wanting total control of the Artic oil. They want Euro and NATO dissolved before that to make it a cake walk. Duh.
3204 2018-06-30 17:09:13 Oil, similar to his announcement this morning, he'll likely take an oil commitment, that Putin will be happy to provide, & try to spin it as Russia doing the US a favor since he acted to further destabilize the middle east & we should relax Russian sanctions & chum up.
3205 2018-06-30 17:09:09 Last time at the dealer was about the same for Mobile One full Synthetic, same as I always get no matter what. I think the first oil change I did on this car at 3K miles was motorcraft synthetic blend though.
3206 2018-06-30 17:09:08 Bedanya cleansing oil sama mc apa ya?
3207 2018-06-30 17:08:50 In Angola, the most extreme case, after 40 years of Marxist-leninist constitution (not an euphemism) things weere opened in last decade, now the game is outside capital, deregulation, state corruption reduction & above all, econ diversification to not depend on oil price.
3208 2018-06-30 17:08:40 So much for using US own oil Don like you campaigned on... Another failed promise...
3209 2018-06-30 17:08:34 Saw 5 Diesel engines pulling over 58 cars of oil parallel to QEII Highway in Alberta Canada. Meanwhile wheat stockpiles are backed up for months and sitting in Saskatchewan with zero rail space for transport. How stupid are our politicians?! #buildtheline
3210 2018-06-30 17:08:14 I like Trumps oil tweet today
3211 2018-06-30 17:07:51 I feel for you and think a lot of other's do, too. It's really a great *country*, but seems that the idgit-in-chief would like to ruin every corner. Wants to drill for oil and other resources in national parks and most of the coast. Up until 2yrs ago, didn't think about moving.
3212 2018-06-30 17:07:50 @ForexStopHunter Today in the Eagle's Nest we reviewed our plans for Indices, oil, metals and FOREX.  Dale shared his insights and prognostications.  One session can easily pay for a years worth of this invaluable, intimate teaching.  Be smart, check it out.  Prosper!

3214 2018-06-30 17:07:43 Interesting,  because all the oil masters say on BBC ... gas is high because of ONE PERSON ... you
3215 2018-06-30 17:07:40 Me neither.  It would involve buying a bottle of wine.

I'd do something like orange juice/lime juice, olive oil, cumin, cayene, garlic cloves.  Maybe some Worcestershire sauce and some liquid smoke.  Some coriander or paprika or chili powder.
3216 2018-06-30 17:07:38 Just spent $100 on an oil change, never going to @valvoline again. Fucking rip off
3217 2018-06-30 17:07:37 They sell it in every black beauty supply store. Luster's makes a pink oil moisturizer and so does Bronner Brothers.
3218 2018-06-30 17:07:33 Every time I get my oil changed, they bring in my filters and tell me I need to change them... I just say “nah just put those back in there. The airs fine.”
3219 2018-06-30 17:07:31 India should make a policy for Iranian Oil @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp 
Iranian Oil can be divided into two segments
1. Direct supply (~12M)..which must be in Rupee
2. Another Route (~7M)..prefer Russia and here we can use russian ruble
Talk to Iran and Russia
3220 2018-06-30 17:07:19 This is leadership? We have the technology to ween ourselves from oil and use energy that is less expensive and doesn’t polute our world. This is the leadership we need now. If you can’t provide that then ...........bye. Your history is sealed!
3221 2018-06-30 17:07:14 Knocked out an oil change in the wife's car, now looking to get two 12"for mine. Ze hunt begins
3222 2018-06-30 17:07:11 Oil is traded on the world market and any cuts or increases to production impact that.  It has little to do with “climate change” alarmism or skepticism.  We really rely on fossil fuels a LOT and will for a LONG time so any increase in costs is regressive and hurts the poor.
3223 2018-06-30 17:07:05 Thanks for taking my car to get an oil change 
3224 2018-06-30 17:06:48 Like Trumps tweet on oil today

3226 2018-06-30 17:06:36 And we thought you were a friend of the oil industry. There goes the Texas vote..maybe it was not King Salman but stuttering Bob pranking you again.
3227 2018-06-30 17:06:25 Heavenly Father, anoint my Brother Ken with the oil of gladness today. Renew his strength, resolve, and peace. Bring hope alive with new eyes of understanding in the name of Jesus. Amen.

3233 2018-06-30 17:05:48 Terrible corruption there, terrible news this National Park is being sold out to oil. The clock is ticking on the extinction of the Silverback. All for money, greed and power.
3234 2018-06-30 17:05:46 See, the king of kindness should have his features preserved in oil! I want to do it sooo much! He's so interesting and difficult to draw, it would truly be the challenge of a lifetime trying to capture him.
3235 2018-06-30 17:05:35 Seabass, Bouillabaise potatoes, green stuff, finished with anchovy oil
3236 2018-06-30 17:05:29 BREAKING: This morning the President tweeted that he had convinced Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production up to 2 million barrels.  Doing so would break OPEC rules.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

SURPRISE, SURPRISE!
3237 2018-06-30 17:05:27 Not doing anything to stop dirty oil production in the oil sands is being dismissive to the environment.  When will you stand against it and do something real
3238 2018-06-30 17:05:27 More is an ignorant fear mongering snake oil salesman."
3239 2018-06-30 17:05:20 U do the same have a great rest of the weekend and a great 4th I volunteer to rub oil over u if u layout in that micro bikini or I have a hot slippery substitute for oil  
3240 2018-06-30 17:05:16 "MAYBE" up to 2m barrels". We will see b/c oil prices have shot up from $68 a barrel to $74 since 6/26 due to your State dept. demanding all countries to halt imports of Iranian oil. Oil has gone from $64 to $74 since 6/19 (VZ a factor too). Oil was $45 exactly one yr ago.
3241 2018-06-30 17:05:03 Bullshit they already decided to up oil production. It's not about you!
3242 2018-06-30 17:04:59 a top and a power bottom oil on canvas (2018)
3243 2018-06-30 17:04:52 Great to see @BlairKing_ca you agreeing publicly now about the risks these oil tankers pose to our shared coastline! I’m sure you agree even more that oil tankers passing through the difficult Burrard Inlet Narrows pose an even greater risk to our coast and the ecosystem below!
3244 2018-06-30 17:04:46 Saudis Boost June Oil Production Close To All-Time Highhttps://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudis-Boost-June-Oil-Production-Close-To-All-Time-High.html #oilprice
3245 2018-06-30 17:04:29 Iran was ravaged, betrayed, corrupted and destroyed because of our vast oil supply and for our brain power.  How do you think iranian americans are the most highly educated minority group in america? In such a short time? Iranians can do anything with almost nothing.
3246 2018-06-30 17:04:25 Good that they pull out of Virunga but who ever gave permission for exploration in the area should know this will disturbs the ecosystems and if oil found then they will want to exploration rights thus at the end is the same
3247 2018-06-30 17:04:18 So, trump the magician asks the King of Araby and it is done! The price of oil is going down. Down how much... he didn't say, but I'm certain price at the pump will now be only $1.280 per gallon! All praise 
3248 2018-06-30 17:04:17 Look at these exquisite oil paintings by Belarusian painter, Dmitry Kustanovich. He's mastered more than one style :O :)

3251 2018-06-30 17:03:57 I thought far right meant Nazi. Can't be a Nazi and a Jew. It's like saying oil & water are the same thing. Don't care for @benshapiro as much as some but he does have good points & wouldn't call him a troll. If so, then do is @billmaher .

3256 2018-06-30 17:03:19 3/ from about 1947 to 1970 the US had a large trade surplus with many countries b/c it was building and selling products the world demanded. This has changed.  Now a large volume product US buys from CDN is oil/gas. This is a large part of the trade deficit. Stop buying oil???
3257 2018-06-30 17:03:03 oil is the cancer of mother nature...
3258 2018-06-30 17:02:54 Why would they do that?? Lower oil prices mean a huge hit for them and less stability in Saudi Arabia. They rely on it as they have nothing else of value.
3259 2018-06-30 17:02:54 Even the President of United States trying to manipulate oil prices. Amazing.
3260 2018-06-30 17:02:44 Donny ‘explained’ to the King of Saudia Arabia about lowering oil prices. The ‘explanation’ of why the King should do this didn’t work. MAGA #trump
3261 2018-06-30 17:02:37 Really really bad take... the reality is that high gas prices which his Iranian sanctions are partly responsible for are nullifying his tax cuts and hurting Republican election chances. He's also lobbying Russia to pump more oil and Russia does want to pump more oil.
3262 2018-06-30 17:02:36 I’m using Schmidt’s right now. I have to add coconut and tea tree oil for it to really last all day
3263 2018-06-30 17:02:23 America is India's friend. But in Iran issue America ordered India to don't buy oil from india. America should know India's situation. Our petrol price is 80 rupees already. If we are not getting oil from Iran then price will increase more.

I enjoy every season with its differences to appreciate...the sun does appeal to me more & more these days though! Enjoy the salami & olives, I made some oil up for the bread with vinagar, garlic & some basil!
3270 2018-06-30 17:01:37 Why is it I have to learn from @SarahPalinUSA (not our media) Trump Scores victory from Saudi Arabia to produce 2 million more barrels of oil?
3271 2018-06-30 17:01:34 I don't have any lube, but I have coconut oil 
3272 2018-06-30 17:01:31 The british establishment is, effective, manipulative and devious. They can normalise sectarianism, and portray oil as worthless. They dominate the media and can dictate narratives.
Screaming about unfairness is counterintuitive. To defeat them, we must exploit their weaknesses.
3273 2018-06-30 17:01:27 Oil per barrel has a history of settling in the $100+ range for long periods. 

There are different supply/demand dynamics now though. Still, be careful betting real money that’s it’s topped.
3274 2018-06-30 17:01:17 Dear World:

Sacrifice your oil magnates so the British Isles can have our rain back.
3275 2018-06-30 17:01:12 If you read your manual a lot of makes are actually 5,000 miles between charges not 3,000 miles oil change shops recommend
3276 2018-06-30 17:00:57 Sure he is. The Saudi government is the biggest employer there and they fully fund all retirments of the country. Yeah they are going to produce more to lower oil prices. Just like Putting is your buddy and you trust him. You are gullible.
3277 2018-06-30 17:00:55 Who needs contributions from capitalist oil companies when you can take bribes from the islamo-marxist world bank & friends.

3281 2018-06-30 17:00:33 I was referring to their trillion dollar oil fund which  will help them when the oil runs a out. Alberta does not have that or anything close to that

The photos of F16 bombing are turble and there are a lot of disasters, the children are burnt live.
The Saudi oil and money make you agree for very thing even inhuman

3290 2018-06-30 16:59:29 AMLO seems to want to renationalize oil. Many investigative reporters B4 died looking into the corruption of PEMEX. Bringing this corruption back is a horrible idea.

And USA is now energy independent, so oil is little leverage for MX.  MX also relies on US tech for exploration.
3291 2018-06-30 16:59:26 US ECONOMY IS JUST SURVIVING BECAUSE OF TWO FACTORS ONE THEY CAN PRINT DOLLAR AND THEY HAVE A PACT WITH SAUDI ON  OIL PEGGED IN DOLLAR . The day it will not happen US economy will collapse like pack of cards .

Although in this example ..not looking at Dollar valuation is wrong but still I will call it Karma for BJP..saddest politics is being played
3295 2018-06-30 16:58:56 Oil changed, $126. Think I’ll start doing this myself. I literally have access to a pit and everything I need. Also have access to a lift and everything I need.

3312 2018-06-30 16:56:59 Oil change and car audio upgrade! Lol
3313 2018-06-30 16:56:41 Wait, you're working with a foreign government to fix oil prices? What ever happened to free markets and all the invisible hand crap?
3314 2018-06-30 16:56:32 man i’m starving and i’ve been waiting for an oil change for three hours kill me
3315 2018-06-30 16:56:09 I think that is part of it, as it came out recently that they approved a couple of synthetic meds at least 1 based off CBD oil with THC. Figure they can’t make money off natural stuff that works, so they have to ban natural and require us to use synthetics.
3316 2018-06-30 16:56:04 Hahaha. That’s funny. What she doesn’t know is most oil companies are part of a huge holding that incorporates other industries. And how about pharmaceuticals? There is a lobby for every industry sweetheart!!

3319 2018-06-30 16:55:51 What about domestic production? Under #Obama, US  oil production increased. @POTUS, have you contacted Russia about oil importation? Just in case
3320 2018-06-30 16:55:49 Could you not scrap mind's eye and just use oil?
3321 2018-06-30 16:55:13 Teacher : Muza
Muza : Yes sir!
Teacher. : What is 1 minus 1 ?

Muza : cooking Oil sir.
Teacher fainted.

3322 2018-06-30 16:55:12 NUPENG threatens nationwide strike over 300 sacked oil workers
3323 2018-06-30 16:55:04 That is great. I find that most info that you see online underestimate the fuel savings with the Model 3. If I charge at home at night, it costs less than 2 cents for a mile. Then there is the time and cost associated with oil changes. Some day it will soak in.
3324 2018-06-30 16:54:51 Did he kiss your ring for keeping Saudi Arabia off the travel ban list, despite the fact that almost all of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? Anything for oil, huh?
3325 2018-06-30 16:54:39 President Trump tweets that Saudi king agrees to pump more oil...
3326 2018-06-30 16:54:38 If your car is newer, go to a Toyota dealership. I bought my Corolla in ORL, but take it to the dealership in ATL. If you’re nice to them, they can hook you up with deals + promos. I was going to pay $25 for the oil change, but the dealer told me about a promo + got it for free
3327 2018-06-30 16:54:34 My two body guards refuse to let me go get my oil change alone 
3328 2018-06-30 16:54:33 Its ASSad who is killing civilians not the rebels.
And yes, for world powers its just a playground and market for arms and a way for cheap oil.
3329 2018-06-30 16:54:26 The export ban would have to be on refined products to make any difference to consumers, which would be much more stringent from the prior export restrictions, which were just on crude oil.
3330 2018-06-30 16:54:17 Tea tree oil helps.
3331 2018-06-30 16:54:14 They decided this before talking to you. Why do you lie about the most easily disproved stuff? Saudi agreed to raise oil production already, at an OPEC meeting. Literally everyone reported it  including @FoxNews @FoxBusiness
3332 2018-06-30 16:54:06 Ok spelling issues here. First, it's dysfunction. And second, it's too, not to. Thanks for keeping us reliant on foreign oil.
3333 2018-06-30 16:53:58 Hope Lucas Oil LM do drug testing..JMO..
3334 2018-06-30 16:53:53 And yet another completely false statement. Saudi Arabia has not confirmed anything. In fact, they are about to raise the prices again. Thanks, stable-genius, for messing up the Iranian deal. Your worshipers can't wait until oil prices go up again.
3335 2018-06-30 16:53:49 @acethespades12 brought me home earplugs because he snores and also took his lunch break to get my oil changed. Wowwie folks, I love this man.
3336 2018-06-30 16:53:32 @animalradio 

Marijuana Dealers pushing pot use on Dogs so help!!

Heavy Pressure To Use!! 
Ok to smoke weed around pets!
And safe because it’s just “herb”. 

Also CBD Oil (I know it’s not full marijuana) but they’re also pushing that.  Dealers say use on Dogs dying for pain.
3337 2018-06-30 16:53:21 They just want to discover oil in the north by fire by force ......is oil the problem ? How have they been able to manage the one on ground over the years?
3338 2018-06-30 16:53:17 Again establish that I am fake Imam I have already established your not a well versed person on the Bible . any one or any item which was annointed of oil is a Messiach Saul was Messiach ooops you mean you did not know , 
3339 2018-06-30 16:53:12 That's a very ideological defense of Hillary acting as Soros' henchwoman for hire while offering an empty assessment of Putin's agenda or Trump's fulfillment of it.
Consider Trump's direct & open opposition to Nord Stream 2 against Putin's agenda & Saudi Oil, not Russian, 2MM bbl
3340 2018-06-30 16:53:04 "The just shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head. For my prayer also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased" (DRV Psalm 141:5).
3341 2018-06-30 16:53:01 that wld be quite the the escalation - I wld estimate China has more to gain w/ cheap oil than stifle US shale, escalate war w/ trump admin. Provided no change to potential trade sanctions US has on table
3342 2018-06-30 16:52:43 After this oil change it’s Smokey time 
3343 2018-06-30 16:52:41 I’m watching Cooking High on Netflix and I’m drooling on myself. Its’s sooo amazing what these people can cook with canna butter and cannabis oil 
3344 2018-06-30 16:52:38 His way to pay you back for not being included in the Travel Ban even though his terrorists (None from countries covered by Ban) killed Americans Here! Also for not making a fuss about Human Rights Violations? What's your PROFIT ON THIS DEAL? Screw American oil Producers ,Right?
3345 2018-06-30 16:52:27 It's not an ideal set-up but this is where they're at. Will be interested to see what direction they go in if the Rattie experiment isn't as productive the second time around.
3346 2018-07-01 23:58:53 i used the siete almond flour tortillas that are frozen and i rolled them up with chicken and fried them with grape seed oil! the sauce is boiled tomato, boiled chile, and some spices it was so good 
3347 2018-07-01 23:58:49 natural which is 8 years now is Jamaican black castor oil which cost me R110 but it was worth it and I'd buy it again other than that, all
3348 2018-07-01 23:58:43 Niggas be tryna burn rubber but it be smelling like a nigga need a oil change 
3349 2018-07-01 23:58:33 spent a couple hours on trey’s boat WITH tanning oil on and still got no color... i guess i’m not going to tan this summer
3350 2018-07-01 23:58:25 Brand new shirt on; and I just spilt olive oil all over it 
3351 2018-07-01 23:58:13 Maybe it is time to move towards The USA for Financial and Defence benefits especially in the oil Industry. Just a thought.
3352 2018-07-01 23:58:10 I paid for an oil change and the dip shits didn’t refill my oil before they gave me my car back. I have a rage headache.
3353 2018-07-01 23:57:58 The issue is simple. Who Invaded who & Who are the victims of Invasion & War. The USA supported the Zionist Invasion of Palestine & have supported the Zionist Regime ever since. Their objective is typical of Usury. Profit from the suffering of others - Control of Middle East Oil
3354 2018-07-01 23:57:48 Scott, hate to break your bubble on this one but the only reason we hate Iran is they sell oil in euros.  Not good for dollar dominated commodity.
3355 2018-07-01 23:57:44 I love jews, Israel but hate Israeli lobby, selfish energy/oil war lobby in US, Salafi fanatics and Irani Mullah regime. I love secular Assad. If the US intelligence agencies along with Israeli lobby had not trained IS style Jihadis against Assad, Assad would not have to do this!
3356 2018-07-01 23:57:40 I love it when democrats eat their own offspring

Sunburns itch, but you aren’t supposed to itch them... 
Your shoulders are a terrible spot to be burned...
Bug bites on sun burns are like fighting fire with more fire...
Coconut oil is helpful when it comes to peeling skin...
3358 2018-07-01 23:57:33 Why are stores closing selling clothing?  Because the clothing is not what we want!  We want natural organic clothing that isn’t polyester from oil and fracking!  We want real fabric of linen, cotton, silk and hemp!
3359 2018-07-01 23:57:17 Who has our oil & Gas at the moment? Who sells licenses to foreign companies? Who asks them to shift their HQ to London or off shore to avoid paying Scots revenue?

Who is humping you cross eyed while you scream in ecstasy for more of the same?

3382 2018-07-01 23:56:04 How is it that I’m so italian I sweat olive oil but at the same time have the pastiest skin in the Western Hemisphere?
3383 2018-07-01 23:56:00 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.

3386 2018-07-01 23:54:28 Nigeria is a poor nation with oil, GDP per capita of ~ $2,000 & 87m poor ppl (scream inequities & 1bn ppl India has 73m poor ppl) fraudulently subsizing the rich - petrol, electricity & fertilizer - with btw 30% & 50% of FG budget.
Our poor need education, jobs & healthcare.
3387 2018-07-01 23:54:15 You can use a soft lint-free cloth to massage it into the leather in small circular strokes. Please keep in mind that it is an oil and will change the color of the strap to a deeper color but it does keep the strap supple and soft.

3394 2018-07-01 23:52:53 they have like oil cleansers and stuff like jojoba oil is a good one, but also like soaps for that specific area
3395 2018-07-01 23:52:42 many oil folks on line today! But shifting gears. just had incredible meal at Cote steakhouse in NYC (22 st) Highly recommend. We were a group so we opted for chefs table selection. won’t need to eat for days which is problem since I am lunching tomorrow w @JasonBordoff
3396 2018-07-01 23:52:30 I am liking the signing the Oil have made so far. Was still hoping we would have Big Rig back #Oilers
3397 2018-07-01 23:52:24 When the dressing and croutons are made from scratch, this is true. Also kale ceasar salad is PRETTY FUCKIN scrumptious. The key is massaging the kale with olive oil before tossing it in dressing. I was skeptical at first, but that shit is delicious
3398 2018-07-01 23:52:20 It has pros and cons, but As of this time, lalong tataas ang inflation rate.. weak peso will mean, higher oil prices (since ang ginagamit nating pag bili ng oil ay dollar).. this will mean higher prices of basic commodities..

3403 2018-07-01 23:51:22 Lol, Trump is a real bully (but still a legend) cause Saudi said they would cover Iran’s share of oil production literally a day before.
3404 2018-07-01 23:51:07 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.

3409 2018-07-01 23:50:43 I used flaxseed oil and sorinkled the Vegan yolk on thr tofu. Then I just added black salt at the end of the stir fry. Added tomato , avacado, green salsa, cilantro  & put all into a tortilla. It was perfect. I vary the recipe. The Vegg is 1 of my staples :) Tnx!
3410 2018-07-01 23:50:40 And don't forget the Chairs at universities that were endowed by Big Oil.
3411 2018-07-01 23:50:39 Just received a phone call from The Master Prophet wanting to send me Miracle Oil...I just need to answer a “few questions.” I think I’ll just pray to my God and ask Him for grace and guidance in my daily life

3419 2018-07-01 23:49:41 You first need a principle of oil wealth sharing to build the foundation for a new social contract.

This then can act as a foundation for a new system of governance with rights and democracy as a key mechanism.
3420 2018-07-01 23:49:28 Inadmissible at trial, dumb point
3421 2018-07-01 23:49:15 So somebody used my full bottle of oil and have the cheek to put it back into my bag nbcb.
3422 2018-07-01 23:49:11 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
3423 2018-07-01 23:49:11 I’ve found that rubbing a Q-Tip dipped in castor oil on them at night before bed speeds up the growth process. 
3424 2018-07-01 23:49:06 coconut oil is the answer
3425 2018-07-01 23:49:03 Did he just delete the Oil tweet
3426 2018-07-01 23:48:54 When I was still a young kid, I realized that the Earth's supply of coal (and oil, minerals, precious metals, gemstones, etc. would be depleted long before the wind ceased and the sun died! One doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to understand this!
3427 2018-07-01 23:48:40 Did he just delete the Oil tweet?
3428 2018-07-01 23:48:33 Because, of course the biggest roadblock to addressing climate change is naturally those scummy socialists. Why won't they just let capitalist oil our way to a greener future?
3429 2018-07-01 23:48:33 Never really read into the essential oils hype but I’ve been so sick and ever since putting peppermint oil on myself today I’ve felt sooo much better!
3430 2018-07-01 23:48:32 True and not true, using something gentle or like an oil is best. Just don’t be using fuckin like st Ives or some shit
3431 2018-07-01 23:48:32 I had an oil leak for the longest but when I change my own oil I fix it 
3432 2018-07-01 23:48:31 Yeah you’re right dude! But the peace of mind that comes with knowing that I’ll never need to change the break pads, change the oil or really do anything much at all is just a bonus on how magnificent this car is to drive and be in. You should give one a try
3433 2018-07-01 23:48:25 A Tale of Two-Face Politicians on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. There was a time, not so long ago, when Hillary (2003) was "adamantly against illegals & their employers"+Obama (2005) said it was "an affront to legal path"+Schumer (2009) found it "inherently wrong." Then snake oil oozed...
3434 2018-07-01 23:48:15 Rumor has it Msr. Fahrenheit also drank cod liver oil for fun and ate kale.
3435 2018-07-01 23:48:14 What really rubs them up the wrong way is, Scotland doesn't even need the oil. We have an abundance of natural green energy. We're even making our own hydrogen to run our new ferries. Suppose we'll take it anyway and put it in a big fund for the future like Norway. #indyref2
3436 2018-07-01 23:48:10 What does JustinTrudeau stand for?

5. No support for Canadians
6. No support for veterans
7. No free speech
8. More illegal immigrants

What do Canadians stand for?

3438 2018-07-01 23:47:48 I think that's definitely a chicken an egg question. You can't achieve stable government to be able to share the oil wealth without a democracy and civilian law.
3439 2018-07-01 23:47:33 Roasted is pretty good. Season it and drizzle olive oil and Roast it until it almost looks burnt and then some parm. Otherwise it is just a vessel for ranch or pizza crust?
3440 2018-07-01 23:47:31 How do you grill yours? I've been doing mine wrapped in foil, with olive oil, italian spices and a little smoked paprika.
3441 2018-07-01 23:47:25 Omega-3 is the most toxic polyunsaturated fat from all of them. Omega-3 should come ONLY from plants, NOT from fish, fish oil is most toxic shit what people can get from nature in their food. Also body makes ratio, you dont need to calculate it :)

3445 2018-07-01 23:46:55 I see the great point that you are making about economic and political choices. Except that you missed out the most important aspect. One country is friends with the US, can attract investments and sell its oil. The other is not and cannot. They both have massive oil reserves.

3456 2018-07-01 23:45:02 So you talking to the Prince and him okaying the oil production tweet...it was just more lies? There really SHOULD BE a LAW AGAINST CONSTANTLY LYING AND TRYING TO DECEIVE the American people. So called Patriots dont behave this way, but Dictators do!
3457 2018-07-01 23:44:57 I agree one never says never in oil but agree it is unlikely but If Golden Pass had access to EOM Permian gas ( negative shadow price) and was willing to eat sunk terminal costs, US LNG could land below Gasprom’s $2.25.

3460 2018-07-01 23:44:34 I love how the left is constantly bashing big oil big everything unless it's A IG ORG for BIGGER GOVERNMENT. Then it's good... IDIOTS. The WTO is a joke just like trade wars are a joke but the binary mindset on both sides is like watching 4D tic tac toe!
3461 2018-07-01 23:44:13 I can’t say enough about the benefits of essential oils. Lavender oil on my pillow has changed my sleep game. Peppermint oil relieved an awful headache the other day. Just wonderful.

A White House statement issued Saturday night said Saudi Arabia maintains 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity, but didn't pledge to increase production by that amount.
3481 2018-07-01 23:41:13 Totally agree.  I, admittedly, diffuse lavender and tea tree oil every night before bed but only because I enjoy the smell.  I worry for truly sick people who look to this as yet another holistic promise of wellness, when, in reality, it might just be a waste of money.

Again, if what you say is true, and I don't know the oil provisos of NAFTA, then Canada would be happy to get out. Can't both be unhappy NAFTA may die AND upset NAFTA

3531 2018-07-01 23:34:14 Great thread, Litsa. Thanks! Just want 2 add another perspective on this-

Also many men aren't open about WHY they're AGAINST Roe. But among themselves, in sleazy bars, or covered in oil under the hood, or reloading their shotguns or golf tees, they do, bragging about ownership.
3532 2018-07-01 23:33:57 All industries over time face competition, unless you are BIG OIL & BIG COAL! In that situation, you say to the Republican Party: WE DON'T WANT COMPETITION!! With that said, the GOP obediently complies and screws all new energy technologies...it's a "conservative" thang..

3536 2018-07-01 23:32:48 Not in that one those are the famous LA off shore oil platforms. Behind me behind huge walls are the pumps that make all the noise and smells.

3538 2018-07-01 23:32:45 My car ran out of oil, like not even a drop left so I had to use my sisters car to run to the store to get some. Then her car breaks down and DIES in the parking lot. Like what the fuck. I hate cars. Why can’t they be simple 
3539 2018-07-01 23:32:43 Its BECAUSE Iran holds probably the world's largest oil reserves and the US and West want it. Just like Iraq. So the regime change quest will never end. The West will create some excuse to eventually attack Iran unless Russia intervenes.

3546 2018-07-01 23:31:20 Yes not that it has swings of $10-20 or so - paper traders do wonderful - same people in many instances were all beared up at $30 - oil like gold is one of those commodities where opinions forget history with ego

3562 2018-07-01 23:28:05 The ironic part is, the oil and gas companies have recently sounded more moderate on climate change than the administration's stance on the subject.
3563 2018-07-01 23:27:24 Why not use bitcoin cash? @rogerkver ? Or have Venezuela change so that they don’t have these embargoes and so on, can sell their oil and rebuild their economy?
3564 2018-07-01 23:27:17 I want to thank the President for the opec deal pumping more oil everyday to lower gas prices at the pump...gas in chicago illinois is way to high.
3565 2018-07-01 23:26:56 Most analysts do not believe stranding of US oil and gas assets will happen within 5 yrs. @DeSmogBlog view oil demand falling 50% or even 25% globally by 2024? Demand wld have to collapse AND countries like Libya, Venezuela, Iran, Angola etc would all have to recover unlikely
3566 2018-07-01 23:26:50 Or rub it with a load of salt and olive oil to soften it, then use it in a salad. Or make kale and chorizo soup...
3567 2018-07-01 23:26:35 Are there repercussions to YOUR LIES? What happened to Saudi Arabia increasing oil output uhhh?!
3568 2018-07-01 23:26:29 Definitely dumbing-down of the 33%, although they didn't have far to go. Also, Big Oil Big Coal have ruled the roost for a 125+ years. Now, they don't want competition from solar and wind, hence, Republicans are dissing alternative energy in favor of oil & coal. Any questions?

3570 2018-07-01 23:26:21 hahahaha... Got to wonder why Lucas Oil doesn't seem to care about an issue that seems pretty obvious with 2 test not being taken or missed, but I guess money matters and they know along with tracks when the black 0 rolls into town so do a lot of people to watch him.

3584 2018-07-01 23:23:56 Iran will be able to sell to China because it accepts the Chinese gold backed Yuan! Saudi still wants the petrodollar, so China favours Iran for oil supplies. Iran is not going to lose out because the US does not follow through on its agreements.

Walked out my front door yesterday and a wasp immediately stung me on the shin. What the fuck.

3600 2018-07-01 23:21:42 So Canada does better if the US economy is strong. So why would your leaders purposely make changes that would cause our economy to be hurt if it would ultimately be bad for Canada? If they were halfway competent, they wouldn't. So Maybe they won't charge us $66 for oil afterall
3601 2018-07-01 23:21:40 My original plan for today was to add more  proofing to the garden. Right now, I am slathered in coconut oil and aloe to keep the sting out of the sunburn, while I watch Queer Eye season one and knit. That works too. #missyougarden #ithurtstomove

3624 2018-07-01 23:17:10 FWIW I worked for him in Sydney in the 90s. Flat rate of pay, every day. Same staff ‘meal’(sliced tomatoes, bread & oil), everyday. He added 10% surcharge on Sundays & Public holidays, I made a point of telling customers it wasn’t going to the staff.

3626 2018-07-01 23:16:57 If you don’t mind me asking, where do you purchase the ordinary rose hip oil from? Sephora doesn’t seem to carry it anymore and I’ve seen reviews on Amazon claiming they’re not receiving the real thing. Thanks in advance!
3627 2018-07-01 23:16:46 Atta boy Donnie call up those Saudis and get them to increase oil production. This stuff is so simple, even a dotard could do it. OPEC won’t care.

3633 2018-07-01 23:14:29 My goodness. Russia will not be an asset to America. They produce oil but most other things we get else where. It appears we will be purchasing from Russia after Trump blows everything else up. Handwriting on the wall.  Buckle up
3634 2018-07-01 23:14:02 We need to vote Republican Incumbents out of office, way too much snake oil has been drank.

3637 2018-07-01 23:13:38 Just because you were in a @thyssenkrupp_en @thyssenkrupp elevator doesn’t mean it was there fault.  Probably wasn’t, actually.  Would you blame your car manufacturer if you never changed the oil and it broke down?
3638 2018-07-01 23:13:38 Utter rubbish. Cryptos trade on two psychological factors: greed and fear; nothing else. The entire concept is nothing more than digital snake oil. Eventually everyone wakes up to that fact and these “coins” go to zero. Greater fool theory at its finest.
3639 2018-07-01 23:13:33 Still, the whole petrodollar edifice lies on OPEC – and the House of Saud– pricing oil in US dollars; as everyone needs greenbacks to buy oil, #everyoneneedstoBuyUSdebt. Beijing is set to break the system – as long as it takes.

3640 2018-07-01 23:13:31 Let us channel the recovered loot to reviving AJASTEEL,bail out our Textile Industries and Sugar Industries.Then we can say bye to over-reliance on oil.That is the real distribution to Nigerians.

3642 2018-07-01 23:13:07 This is the case of a typical African, complaining even if things are positive...why don’t you come up with ways to make sure that the subsidies continue...Europe has no natural resources yet they’ve been subsidizing for citizenry for ages. Nigeria has all that oil!!! Be quiet
3643 2018-07-01 23:12:43 What isn't?   What has outrage gotten us?  Nothing happens when we expose republican crime.  Nothing happens when a supreme court seat is stolen.  Nothing happened when trump said he can pardon himself.  Nothing happened when the oil companies were put in charge of the EPA.
3644 2018-07-01 23:12:40 yes!  i use no sulfates no parabens.  i also use castor oil and rosemary oil :)  thank you

3647 2018-07-01 23:12:29 Meanwhile, you are begging the Saudis to produce more oil and Kim is fixing up his nukes. Where are those kids....? Great...not.
3648 2018-07-01 23:12:23 My mother has probably close to a million dollars in medical bills over the last ten years.  You cant explain to me how this system will pay for her and the many like her.  Not all of us are in decent health.  This is snake oil, pure and simple.
3649 2018-07-01 23:12:22 Yes, I just love how Thug Ford ‘warned’ the oil companies not to raise gas prices for holiday weekends, and then I paid the highest price ever on our way out of town for Canada Day.

3654 2018-07-01 23:11:42 Oil leaks just help lubricate the drive belt.

3656 2018-07-01 23:11:33 The start to every white recipe: olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3657 2018-07-01 23:11:22 So what happens if/when we no longer use oil?
3658 2018-07-01 23:11:01 Year round daylight saving time has been tried before as recently as 1974 during the oil embargo.  It was very unpopular especially for parents with kids going to school in the dark mid winter.
3659 2018-07-01 23:10:58 Pretty sure I gave mom a big bottle of organic tea tree oil at the same time I scored mine, look up all it’s magical properties and make a 10:1 dilution of it and use it for everything.
3660 2018-07-01 23:10:40 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
3661 2018-07-01 23:10:30 I see! I just use an oil bc I can use that for other things outside of shaving but I can't share my hair conditioner with my skin
3662 2018-07-01 23:10:17 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3663 2018-07-01 23:10:10 I honestly wish that taking castor oil while near the end of pregnancy was something that never became known. There’s so much risk associated with it and yet women still take it and then act surprised when their newborn ingests meconium and ends up in the NICU with major issues.
3664 2018-07-01 23:10:09 It's so damn hot outside I can feel the oil on my body cooking me 
3665 2018-07-01 23:10:05 Well I guess time to take out the switch! If that’s to much for your extra Virgin olive oil ears! Not my problem! But to raise your children to be out right disrespectful is wrong in so many ways.
3666 2018-07-01 23:09:38 Because the oil exec's have a lot of alimony and child support (not to mention mistresses, hookers, etc) they have to pay...and all of us get to pay it for them...

3669 2018-07-01 23:09:13 So I was like “internet can I use my favorite magical potion tea tree oil to clean it instead?” And the internet was like “dilute it first and then that’s a great idea and also it doesn’t sting like an angry bee”
3670 2018-07-01 23:09:10 Why stick Spearmint Oil in Prevalin? It's like sticking fire up your nose and down your throat. Yeah, I can breathe now. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TOO with that crap in it. 
3671 2018-07-01 23:08:56 Use oil free moisturiser
3672 2018-07-01 23:08:45 Would be interested to know if decreased plastic bag consumption translates to diminished oil consumption, causing lower per barrel oil prices.
3673 2018-07-01 23:08:45 temperature at the crib: jar of coconut oil now completely liquid
3674 2018-07-01 23:08:42 pancakes and bacon with 3 capsules of amino acids + 2 capsules of b complex + 2 capsules of fish oil 
3675 2018-07-01 23:08:32 Crazy to think De Haan could get 5 when Hamilton is on the roster sitting below 6. Leafs and Edmonton use a guy like Faulk, maybe you can pry Nylander or RNH from Oil - C, LHD, Goalie still continue to be areas of concern for me.
3676 2018-07-01 23:08:28 It's stupid to give credit, or blame to presidents for the price of oil
3677 2018-07-01 23:08:26 Cathy, if your brain was “croaking oil” it wouldn’t move a chigger’s bowels!
3678 2018-07-01 23:08:24 Currently all hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles comes directly from oil. Hydrogen vehicles rely on old world gas station infrastructure to remain necessary, plug in electrics can be charged anywhere power is, which is everywhere. EVs get cleaner as the grid does.
3679 2018-07-01 23:08:22 Argentina agreed to share resources (the oil) back in the 90s under Menem but Kirchner tore the agreement up so now you guys get nothing.
3680 2018-07-01 23:08:14 No wonder they just rinse and repeat same crap over and over again. #PUFA loaded indl vegetable oil SUCKS!. Good for oiling the rusted door hinges. Even lighting lamp with them is toxic. Traditionally, India we used #ghee even for lighting lamps till this crap came in.
3681 2018-07-01 23:08:06 Australian shares are expected to begin the September quarter on a positive note, as Wall Street recovered with with oil and gold prices. The Australian dollar came back to US74¢ with a 0.7 per cent increase. #market #ASX #invest #saving #monday #morning

3686 2018-07-01 23:07:58 serious question, what the heck do you do for a living? own an oil company? I would kill to have a collection like yours but cannot afford it.
3687 2018-07-01 23:07:57 “Something wrong?”

She arched a brow as she looked at him. Her seemed distracted and she was oblivious to what made him that way. 

“Let’s head to the massage room. I need one wil some warm oil.”

She began to walk towards a door that read private on it.

3701 2018-07-01 23:05:58 If are greatest fuel resource is oil, than why do we distribute it to other countries like we have unlimited reserves. I say we stay greedy with our oil, & let other countries find it from some other country. In 200 years oil will be scarce & whoever controls it will be powerful.

3709 2018-07-01 23:04:54 Anyway 
1 Oil companies have been raking it in for years without renewing
2 any downturn is used to shed jobs and reduce ‘waste’. Paying folk off.
3 they wouldn’t still be exploring and finding new fields of vast amounts of oil if it was not worth it.

3716 2018-07-01 23:03:37 Amazing! The Belize Barrier Reef is no longer in danger, thanks to Belize's moratorium on marine oil exploration & increased protections for mangroves.       We must NOT allow more drilling in our oceans.

3722 2018-07-01 23:01:34 Year round daylight saving time has been tried before as recently as the oil embargo in 1974. It was highly unpopular & dangerous for children going to school in the dark.

That was all bullshit, bullshit that you willingly swallowed Joe.

3756 2018-07-01 22:55:48 Why do Americans accept this? I don't understand. Trillions to start wars in countries who have oil, little regard for their own citizens. Cripes. A "democracy" I'm thankful to not be part of.

3771 2018-07-01 22:53:13 plus the legislature is like "OIL MONEY BITCHES" and then production dies out and they're all "WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LET'S CUT ALL THE BUDGETS NOT OUR FAULT" /repeat cycle forever
3772 2018-07-01 22:52:48 every single day i wake up and say "i need an oil change but i'll do it tomorrow"
3773 2018-07-01 22:52:38 This CBD oil that I bought stated that it was in agreement with the 2014 Farm Bill.
3774 2018-07-01 22:52:29 We have a spare one that works good, but leaks oil?
3775 2018-07-01 22:52:28 Don't eat A&W anything other than their root beer. They use fry oil that's like 200 years old that was sucked from the back of an ancient ghost bear that is also a zombie.
3776 2018-07-01 22:52:18 Buying only Canadian oil will be the best thing we can do.
3777 2018-07-01 22:51:57 I’ve found if you leave spray oil in the lines for more than an hour it will always put some more chemical out of the lines, no matter how well you decontaminate.
3778 2018-07-01 22:51:55 my psa for the night is if you haven't fried whole milk mozzarella and then dipped it into a swirl of olive oil & balsamic glaze, then you haven't yet lived
3779 2018-07-01 22:51:40 Isn’t that oil bullish?
3780 2018-07-01 22:51:20 if you like peppers try some padrons. sauteed in a bit of olive oil and salted perfect bar food. also they don't take up much room
3781 2018-07-01 22:51:06 It’s because every day Trump that leads America, Tim feels like he’s back in the Shawshank prison storage room. Better get some oil on it Tim, because we are making America Great Again.

3785 2018-07-01 22:50:08 Just use a leftover pork tenderloin. Put some olive oil and garlic on it. Browned it a little and then let it smoke on the grill. Shredded it up and added Sweet baby Rays Sweet’n Spicy barbecue sauce on a bun. Put it back on the grill for just a second to warm the bun. Oh yea!
3786 2018-07-01 22:50:06 We need animals but they don't need us. No need to shout. We still need energy. Don't need it for games, but in hospital I do like it. Oil is the worst in every way. Wind is a good choice if you have to choose. Maybe nuclear can be best someday, but not yet. What's your choice?
3787 2018-07-01 22:50:06 Jojoba Oil
This is a well known natural oil that is often used to repair damaged hair.If your beard looks dry and lifeless, jojoba oil will be great for you.
3788 2018-07-01 22:49:52 In practice it’s the water, BUT if you put straight ouzo in the freezer it will also go cloudy as gets colder! Key is solubility of the anise oil in alcohol. Soluble (clear) at 38% ABV & up (ouzo usually 40%); water dilutes. Solubility drops with cold too, though. #ouzyscience

3810 2018-07-01 22:46:51 I remember this Facebook nigga added water to olive oil cause he didn't have enough olive oil in the bottle and wanted to stretch it.
3811 2018-07-01 22:46:48 So many ppl associate olive oil with fatty/unhealthy food when it's actually the bases of a perfectly healthy Mediterranean diet

I wish I was good at cooking lol

3819 2018-07-01 22:46:03 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3820 2018-07-01 22:45:54 “I am looking for a partner. Someone to help me stretch out everyday. Cover me in oil for competitions and give me a good...pounding...workout.”

She gave him a wide smile.
3821 2018-07-01 22:45:52 Walnuts, pecans, and macadamia nuts are really good. Almond butter > peanut butter too. Everyone should eat fish a couple times a week and take a good triglyceride based fish oil or krill oil supplement to get the right Omega3 to Omega6 ratio.
3822 2018-07-01 22:45:51 I do not. After several issues which led to FINALLY identifying the cause, it seems I’m most sensitive to the OIL in fresh cilantro (leaves).

3857 2018-07-01 22:39:36 Trump requests Saudi Arabia to produce 2.000.000 barrels to drop the oil price, while he sends his vicepresident Mike Pence to carry out the interventionist coup against Venezuela. In that way, he shows he wants to sack the Venezuelan petroleum with his fake defense of democracy.
3858 2018-07-01 22:39:31 Trump wants low oil prices, but he will not be able to get it, because he does not understand Oil markets. The situation in both Iran and Venezuela is caused by Trump administration, not other reasons. Trump bought this upon himself. Iran + Venezuela losses will exceed 1mb/d
3859 2018-07-01 22:39:11 Been going on since oil was discovered in Scotland
3860 2018-07-01 22:38:55 I have very close family who are doing very well in the oil & gas industry religion is not on the radar. Ability is all.
3861 2018-07-01 22:38:45 Me to my wife: Is this olive oil or a jar of urine? Either way I'm good.
3862 2018-07-01 22:38:35 8pm pst!!! I have some fun oil and paint. For tonight 
3863 2018-07-01 22:37:39 shame on you FIFA. russia did not deserve to win. that foul should have earned a penalty for them. SHAME on YOU. (by the way how much was KGB's role in it?)
3864 2018-07-01 22:37:36 rumor has it that the Chinese are converting USD reserves into oil - including American oil. to alleviate the trade imbalance
3865 2018-07-01 22:37:34 i kissed an emu once when i was a toddler and also emu oil is good for your face
3866 2018-07-01 22:37:27 I thought politicians couldn't accept money from foreign governments. He is making deals with big oil.
3867 2018-07-01 22:37:21 I put on tanning oil and my dad watched me slide off the leather stool and goes “cami you little oily bastard”
3868 2018-07-01 22:37:19 purivera almond oil
3869 2018-07-01 22:37:18 Cuci muka nya dulu sampe bersih, siapin air anget sama kapas. Olesin baby oil ke bagian yg byk komedo. Sambil pijat selama 15 menitan. Trus udh deh elap baby oil pake kapas sama air anget td .
3870 2018-07-01 22:37:11 What is legitimate paying 200K a week 40m+ transfers. Many teams in the PL can’t afford that. I totally get we can’t compete with oil tycoons or Rich Arabs. But if we could I’d welcome it wouldn’t make it any less legitimate.
3871 2018-07-01 22:37:10 My friend was on the whole 30 and he made crumbled sausage egg white cups. Coated each cup with coconut oil, cooked approved crumbled sausage and put some in cupcake pans, added whisked egg whites and baked them for 20-25 min.
3872 2018-07-01 22:37:06 I came to jiffy lube to get my oil changed and st the waiting room there’s a man staring at me and I just want to runaway
3873 2018-07-01 22:37:06 This baby oil
3874 2018-07-01 22:37:00 wow what a president ask saudia arabia to increase oil and he does
3875 2018-07-01 22:36:51 I have a blue jug from Greece that contains Olive Oil.
When heated by sunlight the shade of blue changes slightly.
I have noticed this and pointed it out. That does not make me racist, anymore than pointing out when people get roused on #QT they change colour.

3876 2018-07-01 22:36:39 Seeing how much hotter it's gotten each year and how quickly the years have heated up really makes me want to clobber Scott Pruitt and America's oil-and-gas / dirty energy aristocracy. They should've never been allowed to buy their way with policy.
3877 2018-07-01 22:36:24 Money/Oil is boss......sadly !
3878 2018-07-01 22:36:16 Aaahhh

No money left
3879 2018-07-01 22:36:14 I really need to change the oil on my Acura but I’m so lazy and this heat 
3880 2018-07-01 22:36:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3881 2018-07-01 22:36:02 Follow whoever on #OOTT or #Trading. But please folks, DON'T give anyone you meet online your money for trades or trading education, and don't put it anywhere they ask you to. There are plenty of scam artists out there. #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F #ES_F #Forex #EURUSD #DXY
3882 2018-07-01 22:35:48 Trump has given lethal weapons to Ukraine which Obama refused. Trump wants to drill for US oil. Obama gave Syria to Putin & allowed Ru back into ME after decades of bi-partisan US efforts to kick Ru out.

Seems to me Trump's policies are far more anti-Putin than Obama
3883 2018-07-01 22:35:36 @Hellmanns 

Hey!  So, I really want to try your olive oil mayonnaise. Before I buy a jar, would you be able to tell me whether or not most folks in your taste tester groups could taste the olive oil or does it taste like regular but using olive oil?

Thank you!
3884 2018-07-01 22:35:32 I'm smothered in hemp oil, laying out getting hugged by the sun

3886 2018-07-01 22:35:28 2018, now is time we should be looking at ways to use wind/solar/hydro energy ..time to stop giving OPEC the upper hand in these awful trade deals... Oil ain't that scarce
3887 2018-07-01 22:35:24 THAT OIL IS A BOMB!
3888 2018-07-01 22:35:22 @thegoldenmuzzy what’s your thoughts on where Maroon ends up? Us Oilers fans would love the big rig back in Oil city!! Ice cap show rocks
3889 2018-07-01 22:35:14 .The Super Highway project is called the (TEPR) Dubbed the Trans-Eurasuan Belt Development willl have to be built beside railway. This is a negative effect as it will also run along oil and gas pipelines making it difficult to build. @geography_411

3891 2018-07-01 22:35:03 Let's be clear. NAFTA hardly created a laissez faire North America & dismantled the Mexican (then PRI dominated, neopatrimonial) state. PEMEX remained a SOE & oil sector pretty closed to outsiders until very recently. US drug, gun, and immigration policy has been a huge problem.

3894 2018-07-01 22:34:11 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
3895 2018-07-01 22:33:54 That aint just oil folks...
3896 2018-07-01 22:33:40 Statistics from Calgary during the recent oil price crash support your statement
3897 2018-07-01 22:33:39 Will we see a video on how the Oil did today
3898 2018-07-01 22:33:36 You're a fucking moron. The Saudi government doesn't control oil production. Oil companies control it, and they can only produce so much at a time. Not because of artificial restriction, but because of how much they can produce with the equipment they have.
3899 2018-07-01 22:33:15 From his bandolier, Reinhard retrieves a trio of items.

In quick succession, he employs his opening salvo: Lobbying an Oil Urn, drenching the beast, followed by a well-placed Molotov Cocktail.

Ignited, the beast recoils as Father Gascoigne screams his indignation.

Great pipeline of prospects and 5 finger discounts courtesy of the Oil 
3901 2018-07-01 22:32:31 The @theSNP should read any Dictionary on 'independence' and 'sovereignty', and then explain to the masses how Scotland can be 'Indy in Europe'.  The reason there is no entry for 'Indy in Europe' is because there is no such thing.  Snake oil.
3902 2018-07-01 22:31:56 For a Pastor to say this shows how politics can make a religious leader miss heaven. Imagine a man ordained with groundnut oil (Not anointing oil) vomiting this trash.
3903 2018-07-01 22:31:55 what nonsense.
3904 2018-07-01 22:30:57 Im changing the oil in my car cuz i dont trust other people 
3905 2018-07-01 22:30:54 While Trumps tweet was debunked his interest in lower oil prices was confirmed.
3906 2018-07-01 22:30:53 That's the water that comes from the oil wells, after recycling there is still dissolved natural gas. In the US and Europe it'd be a jackpot to get that much gas in water, you can make millions from separating and selling it, but worthless in Iran that flares most of its gas
3907 2018-07-01 22:30:42 So far I'm not very impressed with CBD oil. I'm running about 50/50 improvement which is slightly better than placebo.
3908 2018-07-01 22:30:41 Definitely use the oil. Not only helps protect but it totally brings out the color of the wood. Looks ugly without it.

3913 2018-07-01 22:30:22 @pepboysauto I dropped my car off at your Winchester, VA store location for an oil change 6hrs ago, (was told it may take 2hrs). Iv been calling the last 2hrs to get my car bc I have a flight to catch & was put on hold and hung up on. Is this the business your trying to promote?
3914 2018-07-01 22:30:09 But no comment Colin on the reality of expensive to extract oil? There is a reason the NS cut back jobs and production - oil price was too low. Now with US shale oil as soon as price rises much above $70 the Americans start pumping. High NS costs make it difficult to compete.
3915 2018-07-01 22:30:02 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3916 2018-07-01 22:29:32 Yes believe it or not I’ll get offended when people attack my team. I’ve been an Oilers fan since they came into the league. Will I criticize moves they make? Sure. But you go out of your way to constantly attach the Oil, I’ll take exception. Don’t be surprised.

3917 2018-07-01 22:29:13 Our government relies on oil companies for the petrol and they don't pay this much for it, they +taxes on the price of petrol so that it cost R26/litre so the last man to sign off is the government official
3918 2018-07-01 22:29:00 And the floors will be full of grain, and the crushing-places overflowing with wine and oil.
3919 2018-07-01 22:28:52 We should be worried about CCS for CO2-EOR with geological storage. Following the expansion of #45Q tax credits, projects like the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line are coming on stream. CO2 complexes for coal, gas, tar sands, and oil are the future. Don't ignore the political will!
3920 2018-07-01 22:28:49 Drinking soda is like putting the wrong oil in your car .... literally
3921 2018-07-01 22:28:47 @AlikoDangote I came for an interview over 8years ago and I was told that when the oil refinery or telecoms aspect of the Dangote Group kicks off I will be called.....pls sir I hope that dream of becoming an employee is still alive to become a reality soonest
3922 2018-07-01 22:28:23 At Iowa in a Nationwide race. Stenhouse had a healthy lead, but his motor blew coming off Turn 4 on the final lap. Edwards got in his oil, couldn't steer out of it, and plowed right into Stenhouse at the line.

3924 2018-07-01 22:28:16 Perfect example of why there is no honest conversation on illegal immigration.  
No debate can ever take place when one side clings to irrational, illogical and outright false beliefs.
3925 2018-07-01 22:28:15 Are we or another country to determine from whom we are to buy oil.Lots of lives have been sacrificed by ppl of India to achieve self determination

3927 2018-07-01 22:27:44 y’all better stop playing and keep up with your car maintenance lol $30 oil change can turn into you needing a $3,000+ engine cause you waited too long.
3928 2018-07-01 22:27:30 brush the bbq grills with oil before cooking to prevent food sticking. If you use garlic or chilli oil, it adds extra flavour too. Also, if doing a lot of burgers, tape 2 foil containers together and put cooked burgers inside to keep them warm while you cook up another batch 
3929 2018-07-01 22:27:03 oh thanks im just confused and dumb :]
just ordered some lumber yard utility balm and oil. wont buy from anyone else.
3930 2018-07-01 22:26:51 Cabbage slaw with chili-peppercorn oil, black vinegar, soy sauce, green onions and cilantro is a pretty good accompaniment to BBQ pork

3934 2018-07-01 22:26:33 $LG.V #AFRI he certainly has mine too. I'm sure #Lenigas wouldn't mind being called Sheila, Margaret, Hilda, or anything just as long as he can twitter ramp loss making shares all day every day. The irony of "Mr Profit" calling him that too.
3935 2018-07-01 22:26:20 Y todas las casillas que abrieron tarde porque los "ciudadanos ejemplares" no llegaban? Ahora que gane AMLO, a quién le van a echar la culpa de todo?
3936 2018-07-01 22:26:17 Would you say that watch danish oil provides a bit of protection? or if I wanted more of a protective layer so nothing messes up the wood would I be better off with something else?
3937 2018-07-01 22:26:13 I agree
3938 2018-07-01 22:25:49 Make sure to change oil
3939 2018-07-01 22:25:48 He built a  wall.

He instantly reunified America. 
Oh by the way he won the Nobel Peace Prize too.

3944 2018-07-01 22:25:32 Reading that you lied again. This time about Saudi Arabia producing more oil. Does it surprise me that you lied? No, for we have come to expect it from you.

3948 2018-07-01 22:25:04 It’s probably because the hydro and oil goes to blue states? I don’t know... We know that it’s only the Trump and B Sanders supporters who agree with this trade war. Seems like Canada and the EU want to end this quickly.

3959 2018-07-01 22:23:12 yeah, this is a personal high CBD hemp grow, when it finishes it should be around 15% CBD, which is a good starting point to a good oil
3960 2018-07-01 22:23:06 @AJNewsGrid Oil prices are set by market forces not OPEC.  Fear of war, high demand times, supply/demand.  The time when OPEC could set prices is long gone, but apparently Mr Trump does not recognize this

3975 2018-07-01 22:21:19 @realDonaldTrump we need lower fuel costs. Our gasoline price has never gone down, but crude oil prices have tanked. Please help America and get fuel prices under control. Thank you, Mr President. You are awesome.
3976 2018-07-01 22:21:09 Chill out Matthew,Benning did ok today.Flames or the oil didn’t improve,heck I’m not even sold on Tavares as they lost JVR,bozak and komorov.

3979 2018-07-01 22:20:45 ROV's, ROV's are perhaps the best options to gain quickest access to the remotes location in the caves. The Oil & Gas industry has ROV's that have umbilicals 1000's of feet in length, and can operated around the clock!!That is a resource that must be considered.
3980 2018-07-01 22:20:32 Who are these people using vegetable oil instead of butter for quick breads.
3981 2018-07-01 22:20:24 Can you imagine if we had cats of war instead of dogs of war?

3982 2018-07-01 22:20:23 Easy money ? You should be selling oil to help people not make what you call easy money 
3983 2018-07-01 22:20:21 I usually use coconut oil for skin and hair. It works miracles man.

3991 2018-07-01 22:19:34 We have the deficit. Another one of Trump's lies you believe. You get 40 to 60% of your oil from us, along with natural gas, electricity, timber and water. How many of your resources do we buy? We do almost 900 billion a yr in trade and we have the deficit, not you.

3994 2018-07-01 22:19:04 Think about this, same week of his inaguration, he was actively pursuing Trump Tower Moscow. He wants to start a civil war, make as much money off it as he can, take his Rosneft oil profits, and continue to rob the world from his new  sanctuary in the east.
We gotcha Commrad!

4022 2018-07-01 22:15:09 Last week, 52% of college-educated white women began drilling for oil in a group of tired dolphins, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice. But her emails!
4023 2018-07-01 22:14:51 Just remembered back in class 4 when we'd shower then apply soap to our clean bodies. not just to act as body oil but also to quicken the next shower sesh. Just ran from class to shower no need to get the soap.

4027 2018-07-01 22:14:27 Putin will act like he hates Iran if Trump lifts sanctions allowing dollar funding of Russian energy projects and the import of U.S. services and technology to get them going. Russian oil/gas can then replace Iranian oil and gas. This is the long game of Putin and Trump.

4031 2018-07-01 22:13:36 It is oil, we re-framed it. We bought it in a charity shop in Great Malvern (UK) two or three years ago but we estimate it to around 1930-1950. I would love for you to do that, thank you so much. I'd just like to put a name to it, a man out of history. 
4032 2018-07-01 22:13:18 Valuing the relationship w/ the EU doesn't mean unilateral agreement: EU reliance on Russian gas & oil; the Iranian nuclear program; invasion of Libya in 2011, radicalizing N. Africa; 150b trade deficit; Paris accord, to U.S. subsidizing their security...EU can pay more for that

4047 2018-07-01 22:11:25 I'm sincerely confused. Everybody 'gets' that King Salman didn't really agree to increase oil production like Trump tweeted, right? Even the White House itself has issued a 'corrective' statement clarifying that never happened. Did some OTHER uber-bearish thing happen this wkend?

4050 2018-07-01 22:11:02 Before we would pay OPEC prices we could bring our pumps and other methods of getting oil that were mothballed after the prices came down. That also brings more money into our economy. It's not like we don't have our own energy reserves. So it isn't an either-or situation.
4051 2018-07-01 22:10:31 Lolol there’s a big oil trail on the opposite side now because of me

4059 2018-07-01 22:09:11 But if you compare oil w. wind, you can choose the better one. As long as we don't have safer options, choose tse one doing less harm. And creating better one's

4062 2018-07-01 22:09:02 The purpose of well logging is to identify productive formations in the subsurface.  There are 3 things you need for a productive formation: Hydrocarbon Saturation (oil/gas presence), Permeability (rock has the ability to flow fluid), Pressure (energy source).

4077 2018-07-01 22:07:11 It's totally fine that you believe in other projects but never underestimate your position as an influencer to spot the scams, snake oil salesman to clean up this eco-system. Unfortunately most devs forget about the advantages of k-selection v r-selection at very early stages.
4078 2018-07-01 22:07:08 Thanks, amw. The wind/solar/geothermal combo have been pushed and subsidized for decades now and done miserably. So just what revolutionary technology do you think will supplant the coal/oil/gas/nuclear/hydro combination?

4129 2018-07-01 22:00:08 Ojo ,no se pueden poner los vehículos al frío. .... en invierno no los usen ..... mira si en Europa ,Asia y Estados Unidos usaran el super Gas Oil de Ancap en invierno .... dejen de decir idioteces por favor y digan la verdad ,manga de delincuentes.
4130 2018-07-01 22:00:07 Dude it's fairly well know to those who know, ChefJack, and D&C mix like oil, and fire.
4131 2018-07-01 21:59:51 shows up with my legs coated in oil and my eyes all lidded like a high hooker; "gentlemen, get me your finest collection of cocks to step on with my peet."
4132 2018-07-01 21:59:51 Check out @TuckerGoodrich for seed oil info.
4133 2018-07-01 21:59:43 Need me a new bottle of coconut oil
4134 2018-07-01 21:59:24 So I'm watching got and when stannis is attacking the city and when he comes ashore why didn't they just bathe the shore with oil and then set it on fire??? It would've been a better strategy u fucking fools
4135 2018-07-01 21:59:24 #HealthyTip : Coconut oil can burn fat and promote weight loss, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
4136 2018-07-01 21:59:21 Explain to me why exporting oil to #Syria has anything to do with #climatechange and the shortage of water in #Khuzestan?  #Desalination plants are being built, but this will take time.
4137 2018-07-01 21:59:18 Yep the oil....
4138 2018-07-01 21:59:16 I'm out of lavender essential oil, I don't think I can survive anymore
4139 2018-07-01 21:59:16 This little fan is cool put some oil in the middle thing and turn it on and whole house smells good
4140 2018-07-01 21:59:11 今日の会社への道のりかなり空いてたなぁ〜
4141 2018-07-01 21:59:09 Try some of the new BECCA x Chrissy Teigen products! They just released a new bronzer/blush, lip gloss, and body oil - I'm curious 
4142 2018-07-01 21:58:44 By wearing plastic clothes such as polyester, we are all supporting the drilling of more oil and fracking.
4143 2018-07-01 21:58:41 Trump to release Strategic Oil Reserves , 
Ease price @ pumps,
Counter Russia-OPEC plans
Cover loss in market place from Iran sanctions
TRUMP IS A BUSINESS MAN AND A LEADER
4144 2018-07-01 21:58:39 Cbd oil is an oil extracted from hemp or marijuana.
4145 2018-07-01 21:58:13 You know what a can of beard oil goes for?
4146 2018-07-01 21:58:13 Trump has stolen 4000 children from families seeking asylum. U.S. has NO moral authority. Iran has a middle class. Remember when Iraq had a middle class? All to privatize oil.
4147 2018-07-01 21:57:59 
4148 2018-07-01 21:57:54 Permian Basin Oil Field Service companies are depending on, and encouraging legal or illegal immigration since 2014. West Texans tend to vote against their own self interests because of racist sensibilities.
4149 2018-07-01 21:57:46 devi nahi dayan
4150 2018-07-01 21:57:37 Absurd argument. Do you live next to oil refineries or wait for lightning to hit your electricity pole?
4151 2018-07-01 21:57:18 I find it really ironic how working in oil and gas gets you discounts on so many things except actually getting gas. Bonkers
4152 2018-07-01 21:57:10 Not even nearly the same thing, but we have just found that a thing my partner is on is charged @ £100/100ml (to the NHS and he has 15ml/day)  but the neat product is £5/equivalent. The difference? Sunflower oil as the mixer
4153 2018-07-01 21:57:09 てらあり！！！
4154 2018-07-01 21:57:05 Considering his penchant for oil and gas peeps there's an afredo Castro with precision drilling, or there was. Don't know if it's the same guy
4155 2018-07-01 21:56:50 My period is making me all achey and tingly  #mecfs Time for a shower with some white flower oil. #livetweetyourperiod
4156 2018-07-01 21:56:45 "Just stay still~"
Neo went behind Yang, rubbing her boobs with the oil
4157 2018-07-01 21:56:31 Gutted to hear about Virunga oil drilling permission. Heart breaks for the people of the Congo, still exploited to this day
4158 2018-07-01 21:56:18 in what world does watermelon and olive oil sound good? also him at the cheese section made me laugh
4159 2018-07-01 21:56:15 I was born in 1974, but I’ve studied  embargo extensively. I’m making point that in 1973 it was Saudi Arabia that used oil as a political weapon against USA while Shah refused to help. Now it’s USA/KSA wielding the oil weapon against Iran. Times change but oil always political
4160 2018-07-01 21:55:57 I am going to have to change my oil and my transmission fluid and filter now.
4161 2018-07-01 21:55:16 To call working with reputable brands “selling out” is laughable.  It’s good business, as long as you do your due diligence to align with brands that have potential value to your audience.  As long as you’re up front and not selling snake oil for a few shekels, let the $ flow.
4162 2018-07-01 21:55:07 What can I put on a super angry spot? I’ve tried tea tree oil but it seems to be aggravating it! #help #skincare #tips
4163 2018-07-01 21:54:38 حياك الله . الرجاء توضيح الاستفسار حتى نتمكن من خدمتك
4164 2018-07-01 21:54:24 Dunno if your skin will like it, but bio oil works miracles for the scars! The scars around my nipples have disappeared completely, and the large ones have faded a lot (i haven't used it in a while bc I'm having a revision so in case they have to make new incisions)
4165 2018-07-01 21:54:01 I completely agree with you, the fact is when people use Venezuela as an argument they don’t mention against socialism they don’t mention the role of US in inhibiting it’s grown as well as it was not really socialism but more faliure  to diversify its economy as oil prices fell
4166 2018-07-01 21:53:51 He shouldn’t. Democrats apparently are too stupid to pin rising oil prices on Trump’s decision to get out of a functioning arms control agreement
4167 2018-07-01 21:53:40 What is cbd oil?
4168 2018-07-01 21:53:11 .I did not wanna pay for no damn oil change today 
4169 2018-07-01 21:53:10 I love your Jesus tweets; however, a billionaire gas/oil man asked you on a date today. He even spoke to your mom about it (charming & polite), & you don’t have enough ambition to go out? This is the third! Do u realize how rare this is & how many women would jump at this?
4170 2018-07-01 21:53:01 Safe journey Shea.
Enjoy your 4th July celebrations. 
4171 2018-07-01 21:52:51 Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers know it must
be good because the programmers hate it so much.
4172 2018-07-01 21:52:48 It's a shame that you've turned to Saudi Arabia for oil when Canada is closer and has oil to share.
4173 2018-07-01 21:52:45 If I was on Queer Eye

Antoni: You need more oil for those potatoes

Karamo: Get tf back on ur meds

Tan: Youre going to wear out those clothes.

Jonathan: Youve had the same hairstyle for 4 years

Bobby: Ur sleeping on a mattress on the floor with ur moving boxes on the floor
4174 2018-07-01 21:52:45 After I chop my hair off, take my biotin pills, massage my scalp with coconut oil once a week it’s over my hair will be luscious once again
4175 2018-07-01 21:52:18 OIL
4176 2018-07-01 21:52:10 I'm will take that risk. It does not make sense Canada is doing us a  favor selling oil for a 1/3rd what they could get for it elsewhere. You'd need a ton more ships or something. Benefiting from existing pipelines, road, and rail connections make it more profitable to sell to us
4177 2018-07-01 21:51:57 Shark liver oil is used in the production of Preparation H.
4178 2018-07-01 21:51:54 Psalms 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
4179 2018-07-01 21:51:39 One of the surprising effects of Cbd oil I’ve recently discovered is it’s a powerful appetite suppressant. I have no desire to eat and I have to remind myself to do so.
4180 2018-07-01 21:51:31 Holy shit I feel like ive been dipped in boiling frying oil. Im a drenched frenchfry right now and I normally never sweat.
4181 2018-07-01 21:51:17 Hey I got an idea. Let's explode a bomb above a burning oil well to starve the fire of oxygen. Great idea! I'll drive the jeep! Don't forget your  helmet.
4182 2018-07-01 21:50:59 Tires, oil change and battery. At least I got a deal on a battery
4183 2018-07-01 21:50:42 That said, much of that inefficiency comes from the weight of the car. Running the numbers taught me less about biology than it did about oil. Incredibly energy dense. You can see why people kill for it.
4184 2018-07-01 21:49:59 Would be...
4185 2018-07-01 21:49:51 Not a great signing though IMO. Although the Oil were so bad last year it's hard to judge his play.
4186 2018-07-01 21:49:27 Lol  nice one ..... Ps could u oil me please 
4187 2018-07-01 21:49:14 You’re offended that Craig Button, NHL analyst consistently slams the oilers?

The same Oilers that have limited cap space and are coming off a 78 points season in season 12 of their rebuild?
4188 2018-07-01 21:49:07 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
4189 2018-07-01 21:48:58 Have you won the lottery and are showing off about the clock in your new Rolls Royce? If not, check the oil level.
4190 2018-07-01 21:48:52 They can take our oil wealth but they'll never take our baked goods and confectionery. #scotlandthebrand
4191 2018-07-01 21:48:46 Try pesto tofu, it is amazing! Can make your own pesto but if you want super quick meal can get pre-made from Whole Foods. Just sauté cubed firm tofu in olive oil until lightly browned, turn off heat, mix in pesto sauce, add whole pine nuts for extra protein, serve over arugula!
4192 2018-07-01 21:48:31 im gonna make an angst band where all the songs are just oil can harry saying NYREORRYGEROGH for 3 minutes
4193 2018-07-01 21:48:20 Niggas really try to flex in their cars meanwhile when they flip the camera and see their dashboard the check engine light is on, they need an oil change, and they need a wheel alignment 
4194 2018-07-01 21:48:18 The truth is he does not care to, never cared to & literally plays us or sincerity like a fiddle. He’s a master snake oil salesman & self centered huckster with zero humanity. He cares only about winning & having control. BTW: I know him since 1962
4195 2018-07-01 21:48:02 vitamin e oil is amazing!!!!
4196 2018-07-01 21:47:45 Right - which is why they are making an electric version... for those oil barons.
4197 2018-07-01 21:47:44 Is anyone among you sick? He must call for the elders (spiritual leaders) of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; ...

James 5:14-15 AMP
4198 2018-07-01 21:47:41 Coming from the instigator himself. When you pour oil on fire....Trump and everybody else in his kindergarten should be FIRED!
4199 2018-07-01 21:47:31 guess you gotta be Pink Oil Moisturizer now
4200 2018-07-01 21:47:27 I finally got around to getting some CBD oil and let me tell you.. LIFE CHANGER 
4201 2018-07-01 21:47:12 Great work, btw what about olive oil?
4202 2018-07-01 21:47:09 David, what do you think the Oil will do with Bouchard? Play the first nine then sent down?
4203 2018-07-01 21:47:08 International exposure is good, but it’s not the coconut oil to every problem abeg.
4204 2018-07-01 21:47:04 (Or perhaps a tiny bit of olive oil, my wife has just suggested.)
4205 2018-07-01 21:46:54 5 Hour wait for a oil change
4206 2018-07-01 21:46:41 Am I miserable or am I just crying cus I’ve put too much olbas oil on my pillow. Dunno
4207 2018-07-01 21:46:39 Drivers Meeting will be held at 6:00 pm ET. Lucas Oil Late Model drivers meeting will be held at the Lucas trailer and AMS drivers meeting will follow at the Pit Shack. #RaceMansfield #Freedom50 #SummitRacingEquipment
4208 2018-07-01 21:46:35 I’m in Costa Rica right now. San Jose has holes in the sidewalks the size of oil drums. It’s a beautiful country, but it has a lot of other issues that need to be rectified. Great ploy for tourism though.
4209 2018-07-01 21:46:23 Coconut oil maybe?
4210 2018-07-01 21:46:15 Baby oil helped when my dog had a little rash like this
4211 2018-07-01 21:45:50 The US is now producing 10.9 million barrels of oil a day and is exporting 3mm per day. And yet, because the socialist paradise's production has fallen off a cliff, oil is up to $74. We predict it moderates, plus we're due for a recession.
4212 2018-07-01 21:45:48 I've just made myself some golden milk with coconut oil and turmeric. It's *supposed* to be good for menstrual cramps, hormone balancing and helps you sleep. The jury is still out. 
4213 2018-07-01 21:45:47 Maanghang ba yung efficascent oil? Bakit wala akong nararamdaman, manhid na ba ako?
4214 2018-07-01 21:45:11 I thought coconut oil was bad for us!  
4215 2018-07-01 21:44:59 Bloody brilliant!  ‘What about olive oil though?’ 
4216 2018-07-01 21:44:53 I did something similar with cannabis and coconut oil. Thinking back, I should have also made narcotic-strength caffeine to go with it due to the 18 hour naps it induced.
4217 2018-07-01 21:44:53 Thanks. I do take fish oil, Ocuvite, and the new Ocuvite that is supposed reduce eye strain. 
4218 2018-07-01 21:44:46 Oil money gang   
4219 2018-07-01 21:44:45 That's better for prevention before it occurs. The oil is more a "cure" for after infection.
4220 2018-07-01 21:44:42 All my herbs seem to be doing well this year.  A basket of oil-garlic-herb-coated new Valley potatoes are going on the grill right now...and that's a basket of goodness right there. 
4221 2018-07-01 21:44:30 i shave with honey conditioner or coconut oil 
4222 2018-07-01 21:44:10 Food truckin. Cause of the oil spill song?
4223 2018-07-01 21:44:03 You didn’t say it was little hun 
You said it was burns from hot oil and bleeding from your foot
4224 2018-07-01 21:43:59 Does anyone know of a good leave in cream/oil for curly hair that isn’t ridiculously expensive???
4225 2018-07-01 21:43:41 Ive learned long ago Bush vs Gore.Corp Dems are much better then far right warmongering starve the poor feed the rich trickle down snake oil ecomics loving swine
4226 2018-07-01 21:43:39 i hate having a car that take full synthetic oil !!!! high ass oil changes lmao fuck
4227 2018-07-01 21:43:34 If you believe that... I have some ‘totally legal’ hemp CBD oil to sell you out of my van!
4228 2018-07-01 21:43:10 Sorry, I didn't recognized the painting. I like it, it  looks like an oil painting. Where and when did you buy? I can ask about it if you wish at the fb clown groups...
4229 2018-07-01 21:43:07 Move to norway. We have fish, potatoes, vikings and oil.
4230 2018-07-01 21:42:59 Now my mom is really mad bc I mistreated her favorite olive oil bottle and lost the cap I’m gonna jump out a 2nd story window
4231 2018-07-01 21:42:43 Josh was simply supposed to just change the oil in my car and now it’s going to the shop for the week because he found like 5 things wrong 
4232 2018-07-01 21:42:38 Olive oil maybe? 
4233 2018-07-01 21:42:10 Monday morning forward- #UPL  news due on Sarawak/Petros oil, N Africa and Wick rig.

4235 2018-07-01 21:41:41 a fture is coming where water is going to cause more wars than oil ever has!
4236 2018-07-01 21:41:22 Oil that shit up!
4237 2018-07-01 21:41:07 You have every right to speak out indeed. Please don't take it personally but as an American it is just fine with me that people from other counties dislike my President. He doesn't represent you, he represents me. If you can make more money selling oil to China. do it.
4238 2018-07-01 21:40:56 ... thanks to Republicans who can't figure out how to line their own pockets enough with the proceeds (unlike they do w/oil cos and automobiles) 
4239 2018-07-01 21:40:56 Very sad...when I don’t need and can’t use 2 bottles of oil in a year. It’s crazy...the one not taken can be sold at regular price after the sale. #poorbusinesspractice
4240 2018-07-01 21:40:44 Iran is feeling the heat. “Iran has asked fellow OPEC members to "refrain from any unilateral measures", warning that would undermine the unity of OPEC, following reports that Saudi Arabia has raised its oil production to a record high this month.”
4241 2018-07-01 21:40:35 My cart cracked and it still had oil left  R.I.P gone too soon
4242 2018-07-01 21:40:35 It ain’t been a whole year for yours right? It’s looking better than mine at that time. I use Shea butter or coconut oil
4243 2018-07-01 21:40:32 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4244 2018-07-01 21:40:31 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4245 2018-07-01 21:40:26 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
4246 2018-07-01 21:40:18 i dont wanna be neither long neither short oil here, rather neutral.
definitely not short. since I started looking into options, thought maybe its a good time to express trade through options betting on vol, since there's a huge excitement about this market
4247 2018-07-01 21:40:16 Coconut oil I think
4248 2018-07-01 21:40:14 Well since the Athabasca Region is the home of the oil sands which exist in surficial deposits that literally seep into the waterways the answer to that is it is not possible to remove these contaminants from the terrestrial or aquatic ecospheres
4249 2018-07-01 21:40:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
4250 2018-07-01 21:40:02 russia did not deserve to win. they cheated.
4251 2018-07-01 21:39:41 Don't know where on the scale Soco International are, but not all oil companies are ethical b*****ds.  Read "Collapse" by @JaredDiamond3 for a compare & contrast
4252 2018-07-01 21:39:25 Those remittances are definitely a symptom of challenges within NAFTA, and they're obviously most targeted on the southern states. And its growth since ~2006 is troubling, but that's connected to the devaluation of MXN due to the drop in oil prices since 2008
4253 2018-07-01 21:39:21 The marketing person that came up with extra virgin olive oil really kicked the can for the next time there’s an olive oil enhancement
4254 2018-07-01 21:39:20 Bout to dieee on this court on this oil 
4255 2018-07-01 21:39:20 Yesss I just put my castor oil mix in and had it in for like 3 hours  hair bout to be buttery lmaooo
4256 2018-07-01 21:39:12 every single time The Donald issues alternative facts, a depressed snail cries for mama #resist
4257 2018-07-01 21:38:37 Get a boat bristle brush and brush the oil down your hair. It’ll help replenish the ends and you’ll move the oil from your scalp so you won’t have to wash so often. The brushes are expensive ngl but worth it. Look up tutorials of how to wash them, it’s easy
4258 2018-07-01 21:38:36 Your argument is that it works all too well at funding, and funding is the issue. Socialism is not to blame for the judgment of presidents and generals. If anything the executive decision making is capitalistic in terms of what wars are fought over. e.g. oil profits.
4259 2018-07-01 21:38:28 それは知っとるけどイベントやる伏線だったのかって
4260 2018-07-01 21:38:25 Addition by subtraction
4261 2018-07-01 21:38:19 Wow! The Rethug head of what is supposed to be the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Agency practically wetting himself to prove to @BP_plc how much he cares about the concerns of the oil industry! How much more corrupt could the GOP get? Our poor country!  #RegulatoryCapture #Shameful
4262 2018-07-01 21:38:03 That’s so fricking amazing, though.  Finding stuff like that is neat. Think of all the hands the coins might have passed between, what they could’ve paid for. What kind of stories were told on the pottery. What that oil lamp might of illuminated.  I love history.
4263 2018-07-01 21:37:59 Omega 3 can be a big help. Vegans can use flaxseed oil.
4264 2018-07-01 21:37:54 lmao for real and i been hitting the oil pen all day
4265 2018-07-01 21:37:35 will fight on 'vikas' (#$%^%^), and will get beaten badly....

4271 2018-07-01 21:36:57 I got the wild growth oil! It’s just bc mine is too short to cornrow I be so frustrated lol

4274 2018-07-01 21:36:39 @realDonaldTrumclass+p  HOW ABOUT PUTTING TARIFFS ON EXPORTED OIL WHICH IS A DCELINING RESOURCE+VITlAL TO OUR NAtionAL DEFENSE AS ANY OF OUR WEAPONS WHICH CAN'T BE USED, MANUFACTURED OR even  SHIPPED.

4278 2018-07-01 21:36:10 I'm in Lehigh Co & just discovered that the insect I've been trying to identify is the #SpottedLanternFly nymph.

4283 2018-07-01 21:35:33 My sister and I are 20 and 27 years old and we still just had to go in the bathroom together and hide to put tanning oil on because my mom will STILL kill us if she sees us doing that 
4284 2018-07-01 21:35:31 North British was a company’s name. It was not a government term. 
Is Facebook a number of faces on books?  Is BP’s petroleum British?  Is Shell Oil’s oil from shells?  What about McFarlane Clansman?  They aren’t even in a clan. 
You should investigate these misdescriptions.

4296 2018-07-01 21:34:20 Oh there was definitely more than one, there were trained mercenaries, mobsters, and CIA agents out there to get him that day. The big guys that wanted him gone were big oil, big pharma, the mob, his vice president LBJ, Nixon, and the CIA. Oswald got set up if you ask me.

4298 2018-07-01 21:34:15 Come taste our new seasonal summer products. Lime Balsamic, Passion Fruit Balsamic and Hickory Wood Smoked Extra Virgin Olive Oil. They're all out of this world delish!
4299 2018-07-01 21:34:04 If I were OPEC I’d be pumping and selling as much oil as I could suck out of the ground now because we are probably only 20-30 years away from demand being cut in half, maybe more.
4300 2018-07-01 21:33:59 We weren’t invited into the Union Wayne , we were robbed by the Labour Government on the first referendum, then by fear tactics in the 2nd referendum, the Union offers nothing now , they’ve taken all industry, banks , robbed oil resources for years . Your link lies

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
4313 2018-07-01 21:31:48 Welcome to the Oil @TobiRieder8!!
4314 2018-07-01 21:31:38 The bigger oil companies need to establish a meaningful code of environmental conduct fit for 2018.
4315 2018-07-01 21:31:33 Those victims need to drill for oil

4317 2018-07-01 21:31:30 Courier parked in a shop for delivery. Painter wanting to paint this shop (not any of our painters). Old man painting small oil paintings in the shop. Loitering wife watching him. Man trying to sell me books even though we don't sell books.
4318 2018-07-01 21:31:15 Krill oil works very well for my chronic dry eye syndrome. Also a warm gel mask on eyes for 10 minutes each day. I am not taking meds for it and am doing quite well even when I run out of krill oil sometimes.
4319 2018-07-01 21:31:04 I ain’t like the why my bike chain sounded last night I gotta clean and oil it
4320 2018-07-01 21:30:49 marinade them in whatever you fancy, chilli with olive oil would be nice. They're pretty versatile, but easy to overcook so only needs a few mins on each side.
4321 2018-07-01 21:30:41 Shame to British government for this evil deeds against the black community. The question is are supposed to be together in the first place if not for British criminal mind set to steal oil and gas in Biafra land.

The people are broke the only economy it will effect will be the British and American oil industry.
4332 2018-07-01 21:28:41 Try threading! I used to always break out, out some cocunut oil and vasaline. It’ll help, but threading is painful but soooo worth it
4333 2018-07-01 21:27:54 Double dose of black seed oil and a cup of elderberries 
Can’t let these trips break my body down
4334 2018-07-01 21:27:31 @ogunsanwojide currently giving a massive breakdown of the 2018 budget @channelstv .

He has exclaimed oil is not our Jesus Christ.
4335 2018-07-01 21:27:22 The @GOP is a party of snake oil salesmen who blame the DEMS for everything while they rob their base blind.
4336 2018-07-01 21:27:06 Ada lagi tak simple cleansing oil?
4337 2018-07-01 21:26:57 Neo kisses Yang back while still rubbing her backide with the oil
4338 2018-07-01 21:26:55 I hate the process of taking make up off idg how people say its so satisfying and fun like sis I'm about to pass out but I got to rub coconut oil on my face for 10 mins wash it off and then deep cleanse ma skin before I can even think about getting into bed
4339 2018-07-01 21:26:53 a good multivitamin (i use gat sports), omega oil, probiotic, and maca should be good to start you off
4340 2018-07-01 21:26:41 Yeah, it really is. Plus, I never wanted to be a hired assassin for oil, banking, pharmaceutical, and corporate interests. The last soldiers that defended America and her constitution were in WWII and maybe, Korea.
4341 2018-07-01 21:26:36 Then he wasted pine oil all in my hair knowing I just washed my hair I can’t stand his dumb ass

4345 2018-07-01 21:25:56 He's really good but at no point was he the best CF in baseball. No makes more highlight reel grabs but that's an altogether different discussion.
4346 2018-07-01 21:25:43 Correction: it’s been 3 years of failure and frustration. Oil was booming earlier, there were no problems. You dropped the ball while laughing about it. Responsible govt would have enacted steps to protect Alberta’s top industry. But socialism and business never mix do they?
4347 2018-07-01 21:25:14 #NaturalHairLadies ; a better oil than coconut oil?

4360 2018-07-01 21:22:58 Until oil and gas comes under GST, there is nothing to celebrate!
4361 2018-07-01 21:22:48 Scott, now we've known eachother how many years? I've not once called for injury to you or said you needed to be boiled in oil. Can you say the same to me? Whose presumptuous
4362 2018-07-01 21:22:37 Vegetable oil in eyes = blurred vision
4363 2018-07-01 21:22:37 CBD oil, PS-100 and l-theanine powder.  CBD works right away.  PS and theanine build over a few days, sleep gets a little better as you go.
4364 2018-07-01 21:22:26 So lower oil prices is going to help Venezuela, a major oil exporter... how?
4365 2018-07-01 21:22:22 It's heavy oil and should be left in the ground forever, and we need to find alternative energy sources which don't despoil the environment. Oh, and Happy Canada Day, fellow Canadians. 
4366 2018-07-01 21:22:16 Boiling in oil.
4367 2018-07-01 21:22:08 just covered my damaged ass skin in lavender oil and now everyone around me is dying sorry
4368 2018-07-01 21:22:02 Greg used to say that in an RE8 you needed to keep your scarf over your mouth so as not to swallow too much of the castor oil sprayed from the engine, or you’d get the trots. Definitely best avoided.

4372 2018-07-01 21:21:16 Slice them thick, toss in olive oil, salt and pepper and barbecue/chargrill. Great through tomato sauce with pasta or in a curry. Charring adds such a great flavour
4373 2018-07-01 21:21:04 Yes you are!! I'm so cool with all Pisces women but then men!! We're like oil and water.
4374 2018-07-01 21:21:04 Also this is due to rising oil prices globally
4375 2018-07-01 21:21:02 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4376 2018-07-01 21:20:54  I’ll forgive you and take fish oil.
4377 2018-07-01 21:20:38 They are the owner of the money.The money comes from oil drilled in their region .Monies paid to killer herdsmen where is it coming from sale of Cows?
4378 2018-07-01 21:20:27 All you have to do us release American oil reserves. That is just sitting there for this reason. I guess you couldn't ask Putin about his oil.
4379 2018-07-01 21:20:27 Did you change your oil???
4380 2018-07-01 21:20:16 Laughed when I was at an Oil game live and their in-arena trivia question was: "Which three Oilers on the current roster were taken 4th overall?"

It was Pouliot, Reinhart and Larsson.
4381 2018-07-01 21:20:07 And yall have a pot full of oil.
4382 2018-07-01 21:20:06 I was skeptical at first, but guided meditation has really helped me, both in falling asleep&staying asleep. 2 apps I use are @Headspace & @inscapelife. I’ve been diffusing essential oil blends at bedtime too, which, even if they don’t actually help, smell lovely. Wishing u rest!
4383 2018-07-01 21:19:58 Haha. Yes the oil has been there for years. The reason why it hasn't been produced is, that most of it is non commercial. Plus this guy only pumps and dumps stocks that's why he's being so rampy!
4384 2018-07-01 21:19:56 Eggs + Melted Cheese + Butter as substitute oil = Good shit experiment
4385 2018-07-01 21:19:38 i wish that was oil it’s just sweat 
4386 2018-07-01 21:19:11 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

4390 2018-07-01 21:18:35 I got a free bottle of olive oil from Harmon’s today it’s probably the highlight of my week.
4391 2018-07-01 21:18:29 The character of Hud in Cloverfield. Only flaw in an excellent movie.
I get that he’s there to raise a couple of laughs, but was so thick he was verging on having a mental disability.
Made the best mate relationship with Rob (VP of an oil drilling company!) less believable.
4392 2018-07-01 21:18:24 Not sure what 3rd world shit hole you live in but the US economy is #1 in GDP and #20 in GDP per capita, countries with higher GDP/CAP Are sparsely populated oil producers and geographically insignificant tourist/gambling destinations.

4396 2018-07-01 21:17:46 Oh Chuckie Joe, 4 pretending to be a world watcher smarter than us common folk, you aren't very bright. Let's try small bites: carrots/sticks/triangulation; summit's with China, then Norks, now Russia; crude oil supply from Saudi, not Iran or Venezuela (no $ flow 4 terrorists)
4397 2018-07-01 21:17:43 why is coconut oil $17

4400 2018-07-01 21:16:59 Chef Ramses cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with toothpaste.
4401 2018-07-01 21:16:50 This sounds weird, but get some primrose oil and rub it in your lady bits leading up to labor. Helps keep you from tearing!
4402 2018-07-01 21:16:50 Please do because you said in your tweet that the study shows artery damage, when it actually shows reduced blood flow and calls it a "dysfunction" which is restored after 3 hours of digestion. That is not damage. Other videos say that virgin oil makes a difference.
4403 2018-07-01 21:16:37 Whats the english got to do with it? they weren’t the ones claiming our oil would b worth $200 a barrel try again
4404 2018-07-01 21:16:34 I feel weird bc I'm buying something at the sex shop but it's just flavored oil so that I can make my own lip balm .-.
4405 2018-07-01 21:16:30 I'm fascinated.  Run by me the evidence for the misrepresentation of the oil revenues?
4406 2018-07-01 21:16:12 With tight sanctions on its oil and banking sectors, Iranian businessmen turned to Comoros for passports which offer visa free travel and paperwork ease around much of the Middle East. Over 1,000 Iranians have capitalized on Comoros’ passports-for-cash regime.
4407 2018-07-01 21:15:56 I agree. Also BTC v. OIL and other commodities.
4408 2018-07-01 21:15:53 Hence why taking a pick for Letestu was always the better play.

4411 2018-07-01 21:15:32 I wasn’t going to confess this, but my sisters dog finished off a mozzarella, avocado, tomato and basil salad dressed in lemon olive oil last night. I was ashamed and impressed at the same time.

4416 2018-07-01 21:15:13 Saudi Arabia will increase oil production when they are good and ready, and N Korea will de-nuclearise when they are good and ready .... Nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump
4417 2018-07-01 21:15:03 It’s so hot my coconut oil has liquified.  #firstworldproblems
4418 2018-07-01 21:15:00 Coconut oil solves all your problems
4419 2018-07-01 21:14:45 just tried oil. kinda nice.
4420 2018-07-01 21:14:14 if you can still squeeze the tubes, they're probably still OK, although expect some oil separation.
4421 2018-07-01 21:14:05 @GeorgeWBush_43 the Elders say you get your oil company Texan friends inline as far as Robbing the people's money along with OPEC of course or all hell will break loose in a grave way or for those responsible.. enough is enough YOU SAID YOU CHANGED.
4422 2018-07-01 21:14:01 Yo why is massage oil such a sexualized item like hello if I wanna cover my body in scented grease I can guarantee it will not be sexy
4423 2018-07-01 21:13:50 You’re in Ocean Beach baby; more oil 
4424 2018-07-01 21:13:49 It was about fighting for the country world war 1 and 2 not for oil
4425 2018-07-01 21:13:47 What kind of ??? Targets a 3 year old birthday party?
Just hate happy kids?
4426 2018-07-01 21:13:33 Here is how the Ford's of the political world operate They sell the 10cent a litre tax cut as relief for the 'little guy' when all it will end up being a a massive tax cut for the oil giants while they continue to gouge Canadians at the pumps
4427 2018-07-01 21:13:30 Go around in CR and assemble a car: a front here and a back there, a motor elsewhere... recovered from an old car. The energy (here oil) efficiency of their daily transport is terrible. Given the wealth of the people, no way this will be replaced any time soon ...
4428 2018-07-01 21:13:26 Wondering how close Earths New Oil Czar (Putin) is to unveiling the Reborn USSR ...unstoppable with USA sabotaged from WITHIN and European Union deranged...Putty's sitting on top and bottom of the world....Caviars flowing comrades
4429 2018-07-01 21:12:51 are the psg oil barron’s gonna sell mbappe for 250 mill after the world cup?
4430 2018-07-01 21:12:47 Def a good read, but someone's math is way off: "He bought his car, used, with 40,000 miles on it. It now has 140,000, after driving for Flex for seven months, and Uber and Lyft before that. That means he’s incurred about $40,000 in expenses..." In 7 months- 40K in oil changes?
4431 2018-07-01 21:12:37 smart!! i love cornbread, but ive only had it once since I've gone vegan :/ we have a box in the pantry and you just add water and oil and an egg, but im gonna use cornstarch instead
4432 2018-07-01 21:12:28 It already has coconut oil in it
4433 2018-07-01 21:12:15 I wanna see how many people do this wrong (in my eyes) when doing an oil change at the end do you...
4434 2018-07-01 21:12:08 Its a good thing Bangledesh opened borders for refugees. Now we need to oil industry to respect others.
4435 2018-07-01 21:11:59 Oil control mattifier is my fave 
4436 2018-07-01 21:11:57 I put it in my coffee with coconut oil. Coconut oil helps your body absorb it faster.
4437 2018-07-01 21:11:53 It sure does. That’s amazing! I sure hope they make the change Now!
4438 2018-07-01 21:11:29 My coconut oil has melted completely.much easier to smear on but nearly lost half the pot on the floor.runny bastard.

4440 2018-07-01 21:11:14 They said I didn’t have any recalls when I did my oil change. Was it only on certain makes/models? You have a Jeep? @tijohnson
4441 2018-07-01 21:11:11 Do any of you have a financial plan outlining how the lost income from oil can be replaced?
4442 2018-07-01 21:11:08 Waiting for an oil change and there is lady here who is on her phone and keeps flipping back and forth between Italian and English mid-sentence. It’s both strange and impressive. #PepBoys
4443 2018-07-01 21:11:02 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
4444 2018-07-01 21:10:46 What's your point? Cut off the electric car guy, but give a few billion more to the starving oil tycoons?
4445 2018-07-01 21:10:38 while buying yarn yesterday

I walked by the canvases in Michael's

and....now I can't stop thinking about painting.

I wonder if my....15 year old oil paints are any good still.
4446 2018-07-01 21:10:30 The ingenuity in oil and gas is incredible.  Look into the technology developed for well logging.
4447 2018-07-01 21:10:22 As Venezuelans starve to death while billions of dollars worth of oil lies buried underneath them, I'm still waiting for a socialshit to tell me where I can visit a socialshit state where poor people are not dropping like flies. Apologies for the typos, they are quite deliberate.

4450 2018-07-01 21:10:02 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
4451 2018-07-01 21:09:58 #PutinsStooges Money makes their world go round...Putin now holds landlord status over Arctic and Antarctic Oil Bonanzas..( Rex had a Texas Tea mission he completed) ...now all Putin needs is a Reborn USSR "without" a USA as its sole competition to being earths lone Super Power.
4452 2018-07-01 21:09:54 It's so hot that my coconut oil has completely melted.

#firstworldproblems #ThoseNHSNursesHaveItEasy
4453 2018-07-01 21:09:36 This is also why they enacted the tariffs on U.S. goods. Even oil production has decreased there because of tight regulations. They spend more than they produce in various areas. 
4454 2018-07-01 21:09:35 Misplaced grievance. You cannot put this on people looking for a better future for themselves. If it is not Herdsmen or Oil tanker leakage or striking hospitals, it could be SARS...i cannot blame anyome for wanting to leave abeg
4455 2018-07-01 21:09:31 Snake oil salesman.
4456 2018-07-01 21:09:14 Last 7 years, is that factoring in poop? That stuff stains!!
4457 2018-07-01 21:09:02 Ever tried CBD oil?!
4458 2018-07-01 21:08:41 Aye i do, tell me something did oil ever reach $200 a barrel like salmond was basing his whole we’ll b like norway theory on?
4459 2018-07-01 21:08:38 Making brown rice on the stovetop is like changing the oil in your car: it's worth knowing how to do it, but not worth doing it more than once
4460 2018-07-01 21:08:26 US oil oligarchs is a funny way of saying "the chosen".
4461 2018-07-01 21:08:21 I was going to use it to help check my oil.
4462 2018-07-01 21:08:14 Homemade is the best, at least no sugar and easy to do. better oil at home too.
4463 2018-07-01 21:08:10 Remember after the oil spill when the Obama tipped their toes in the water 700 miles away in Florida? Talk about setting up photo ops.
4464 2018-07-01 21:08:05 Ja polecam: do mycia zwykle mydło siarkowe z barwy i jako nawilzenie bio oil
4465 2018-07-01 21:07:50 I started off as a tool maker to trade, now I'm a manufacturing Engineer, for an oil and gas company..
4466 2018-07-01 21:07:45 Reminds me of the airline fuel tax surcharge when oil was at $100 a barrel.  Then the price plummeted and to everybody's surprise the tax stayed on the airline ticket. Insurer's didn't lower their premiums since Wynne's announcement but I won't be surprised if they raise them now
4467 2018-07-01 21:07:33 International oil prices increases from $30 to $ 77. Dollar has been strengthen against all emerging markets currencies. Get your facts right, Even NS wouldn't able to do any magic.
4468 2018-07-01 21:07:22 It’s so hot in our room that my jar of coconut oil is pure liquid 
4469 2018-07-01 21:07:21 Not if your pals ( US terrorists) the Saudis produce more oil -at your behest-and spike the prices at the pump for US.. but the hell -You don’t care. You don’t have to pay for your gas .. We, the people do ..
4470 2018-07-01 21:07:17 Oil on the go. Flower at home.
4471 2018-07-01 21:07:17  if Brazil and Belgium get through, both quarters and the semi on that side could be tremendous.
4472 2018-07-01 21:07:09 Oh yes, time to buy oil for the ball pit, for ultimate VA show down :D
4473 2018-07-01 21:07:08 Lmao Fariba just said "that bitch needs to fall in oil." About Martha btw.
4474 2018-07-01 21:07:07 I get my oil changed at Ralph Hayes. It’s cool to meet someone from out west that knows about Ralph Hayes. I saw a deal at Piedmont and jumped on it.
4475 2018-07-01 21:07:07 baby oil>>>> lotion
4476 2018-07-01 21:07:04 haha. no but seriously its healthy. if u use a good natural oil to fry the fries
4477 2018-07-01 21:06:47 So we have banned nuclear, fracking gas, oil and gas exploration but we will end up importing gas from Russia! Putin will be so pleased.
4478 2018-07-01 21:06:45 It's confusing seeing world cup and love island tweets literally on top of another.
It just doesn't integrate.
Kinda like oil and water it's just there.
4479 2018-07-01 21:06:43 Ethiopia samali oil is being next year if Allah says
4480 2018-07-01 21:06:41 5)  After the BP spill, Obama bungled the clean up process, he slowed oil production from other companies that had done nothing wrong which lead to higher oil prices.  He helped drive up the cost of gas by blocking the Keystone Pipeline.
4481 2018-07-01 21:06:39 Exactly sista sitting in C block for an oil change 
4482 2018-07-01 21:06:33 It’s so weird that there are NO Mexican/Central American immigrants here in flyover country, yet I get a variety of Spanish-speaking stations on my car radio 
4483 2018-07-01 21:06:32 Ngga need some caster oil or wateva...asap
4484 2018-07-01 21:06:14 So will we.  We have more oil than the saudis, still in the ground ,  and many more untapped reserves of mining. So good for you ,Trumps family only care about his own finances.
4485 2018-07-01 21:06:13 give Harry SuperOmega3 fish oil by Naturnetics n put retaine in 4 dryEye Shop around 4 catarac surgery if that's a problem
4486 2018-07-01 21:05:56 Russians are mad over their oil prices too.  Big compliant at Putin's Q&A this year.  Dues Vult.
4487 2018-07-01 21:05:36 We higher than olive oil, I am fruit salad. Tunechi, get it right.
4488 2018-07-01 21:05:29 One word “OIL”
4489 2018-07-01 21:05:27 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
4490 2018-07-01 21:05:26 Downer: 'Try to see good in people. Stop hating.'
Not easy Alexander, ASIS bugged East Timor ministerial offices allegedly on your orders to screw them out of their oil/gas resources & now, witnessK & his lawyer charged for revealing that criminality? #standwithbernardcollaery
4491 2018-07-01 21:05:22 Tax Money?
That's laughable. How much tax money was spent on the 2 wars your country was in?

Human rights are less expensive than greed over oil.
4492 2018-07-01 21:05:18 No we’re against Trump because he’s a scumbag and a moron that’s distancing us from our allies and seems intent on causing a world wide recession.  As to the law that allows companies to sell snake oil to the dying, he should be ashamed.
4493 2018-07-01 21:05:11 Ya greece or oil gears.

Smoove sounding like Biff Tannin from Back to the Future. 
4494 2018-07-01 21:05:07 A sump dude. Oil sump. Under the engine. It stores engine oil
4495 2018-07-01 21:05:01 Yes exactly

4497 2018-07-01 21:04:45 my dad just took my car and got the oil checked, washed it, filled it up and vacuumed it out im cryin hes such an angel
4498 2018-07-01 21:04:37 I should have said that all geologists know you wont find oil or gas by an active volcano, but that spoils the scarestory
4499 2018-07-01 21:04:20 I would say the same thing is happening Today to the First Nations peoples of the North, whose ancestral Lands are, like in the past, being encroached on by more greedy Wašíču, looking for Oil, Coal & Rare Earth Metals.
4500 2018-07-01 21:04:09 The U.S. banned crude oil exports in 1975 in reaction to an OPEC embargo that created a major crude oil shortage that sent prices skyrocketing, slamming the U.S. economy. The U.S. government overturned this ban in 2015, and January 2016, the U.S. started exporting crude oil.
4501 2018-07-01 21:03:59 Behold... the glory and the power
4502 2018-07-01 21:03:58 You remember that tweet a day or 2 ago from The Orange Asshole about him talking on the phone with the Saudi king & getting an agreement to lower oil prices?

Well, Sexual Predator Donny LIED

4520 2018-07-01 21:02:11 Fat people who fart oil, show racism towards fellow Muslims and cuck for Trump
4521 2018-07-01 21:02:05 I thought I would put this out there. I thought most people knew it. But seems it's not so. If you are being attacked by bees or hornets /wasps in this heat. Wormwood/Artemisia spearmint  thyme plants repel them . Peppermint oil or even STRONG MINTS from a shop they HATE mint.
4522 2018-07-01 21:01:59 More lies on the way folks! Maybe bigger than the Saudis agreeing to pump more oil after talking to assclown. Probably not as large as the fake NK sideshow, that will be difficult to top.
4523 2018-07-01 21:01:31 Says the oil guru! You don’t see the wreak of bias or you just don’t care? Wow!
4524 2018-07-01 21:01:19 The government should consider sharing the oil money instead of just the Abacha loot. What’s NGN5000 going to do for anyone.
4525 2018-07-01 21:01:02 Yup. ALL the Oil had bad moments. I believe Russell is better for us than not.  (Because we aren’t going out and acquiring better).

4533 2018-07-01 20:59:33 If the US would stop exporting our oil wouldn't need to rely on OPEC, shouldn't stayed with the Iran agreement then gas prices wouldn't have gone up. Trump just put target on Israel back, who will get whom first Israel or Iran.
4534 2018-07-01 20:59:18 Driving to your holiday destination? Make sure your vehicle is in good repair. Check your oil, tires and emergency kit before you head over the river and through the woods.

4537 2018-07-01 20:59:04 BTW  The US didn't tank oil prices, Saudi Arabia did
4538 2018-07-01 20:58:53 Actually that’s no true. The USA and RUSSIA have the most of the 3 resources you mentioned. We have the largest oil desposits in the world. We don’t need Canada if they can’t play fair. President Trump will win. Watch !

4548 2018-07-01 20:58:13 @Chi_JBean Hey JBEAN Sunday Cubs Day, you Hear anything about any recall? I haven't, just had my oil changed last week too and update the U-Connect
4549 2018-07-01 20:57:46 Definitely, I mean, we've barely just started adapting to an agricultural lifestyle (still have lactose intolerance and Celiac) from 15k years ago and now we've added oil, food with too much glucose, plastics, instant international communications, etc. just in the past 100 years.
4550 2018-07-01 20:57:42 Ah but oil is running out and the oil prices are not good. Isn't amazing how yoons say one thing but hypocrisy when a fact comes along.
It's then met with a chestnut from a decade or years ago 'ah but Salmond said... '

4555 2018-07-01 20:56:58 This. This is a one year deal and this a one year relationship with the oil. He underperforms, he's out. Over performs, oilers likely won't want to pay.
4556 2018-07-01 20:56:54 Everything is better. Just cooked a meal of local orata, Ligurian style baked with lemon, black olives and thyme, plus roasted potatoes with olive oil and rosemary, simple rocket salad, fresh ricotta with local honey, local cherries, all with a delicately frizzante vermentino.
4557 2018-07-01 20:56:53 So... we could boycott the oil companies.... keep them in their place. Have you heard that there is only one Koch brother now? The one Koch brother has all the power now... I'm thinking it is Charles... he is the only who will get in front of the camera...
4558 2018-07-01 20:56:48 Brother was in a union for his first job as a grocery store bagger. Grocery store paid him minimum wage.
Union left him with less than minimum wage after the dues.
They used the money for stamps to mail him and his "brother and sisters" letters of who they should vote for.
4559 2018-07-01 20:56:21 Hi sure like 2 get hands on a bottle of 1500 cc cbd oil. Prices please.
4560 2018-07-01 20:56:19 So you like oil around $100 a barrel then? Would you complain about rich oil companies and $5 a gallon gas?
4561 2018-07-01 20:56:16 do you want to eat my oil painting
4562 2018-07-01 20:56:04 This is the point of OPEC is to manipulate/control Oil prices via supply adjustment. OPEC don't need to increase the supply America need to remove the sanction.
4563 2018-07-01 20:55:46 Too* Short oil, the lessening in demand from our two main suppliers is going to raise prices.
4564 2018-07-01 20:55:45 Hah you suck bill. Have some fish oil
4565 2018-07-01 20:55:29 Mexico plays tomorrow while I’m getting an oil change... what a time!!!
4566 2018-07-01 20:55:27 Someone said money is the oil that lubricates love. True or yes?
4567 2018-07-01 20:55:18 *whispers* it's the oil
4568 2018-07-01 20:55:14 My mother like to complain that kfc does have rhell oil but after I eat she fry chicken, i does feel like my cholesterol sky high

4572 2018-07-01 20:55:05 Thanks for the compliment!
You shud also try.

1 potato
1/4 onion slices
3 table-spoons of oil
2.5 tea-spoons of salt
1.25 tea-spoon of red chilli powder
1 tea-spoon of coriander & cumin powder.
Some coriander leaves & green chillies before end.
Done!
4573 2018-07-01 20:55:01 Made some very nice steak, Gordon Ramsey style.  Oil, butter, salt, pepper, Rosemary in a searing hot cast iron skillet.  90 seconds both sides, pouring the butter reduction over it. Perfect med/rare that @TaniDaReal and @RichardNightfox would be proud of.  #CanadaDay!
4574 2018-07-01 20:54:49 Hey Putin as long as you give him little russian oil he will serve you
4575 2018-07-01 20:54:45 I hope you are trolling ? Even Vettel said that with the normal tyre it would have been worse. Mirros were banned because it was on the halo. Let's remind us who cheat with oil (start 2017 to help you). And it's not because merc don't get penalize that they are favoured
4576 2018-07-01 20:54:41 I agree about removing the cog labelled SLT! SLT ought to be the gear oil to make everything run smoothly with little friction rather than the spanner in the works.
4577 2018-07-01 20:54:41 - 3 face masks
- estee lauder double wear foundation (i had the old formula only)
- the body shop almond body butter
- beauty blender
- the body shop tea tea oil 
- viktor & rolf flowerbomb perfume (so expensive but the best)
4578 2018-07-01 20:54:29 Oil prices surged to their highest level in more than three years on Thursday, as the number and volume of supply outages continues to rise. The odds of a significant shortfall in supply are also growing by the day.
4579 2018-07-01 20:54:27 Yep, enviro warriors need photo ops. Steel straws will save us but oil pipelines are bad!!
4580 2018-07-01 20:54:20 I promise you, the coconut oil works on my face
4581 2018-07-01 20:53:52 So I requested special prayer for Taylar because of her condition. She cut a fool when the preacher was trying to put oil on her! 
4582 2018-07-01 20:53:51 Protests that started across the country on December 2017 reached the capital on June 25, when merchants from the bazaar in Tehran, came out into the streets. U.S. threatened sanctions on European countries that have not ceased importing oil from Iran as of November 4
4583 2018-07-01 20:53:49 An entire bottle of lavender oil broke in my bag and now I just reek of lavender yee haw
4584 2018-07-01 20:53:46 EJ20 　turbo 12mm oil pump. 9911-4535
4585 2018-07-01 20:53:36 I'm not accepting prayer requests for now. I'm not done praying for people of plateau and victims of Otedola oil tanker accident etc.
4586 2018-07-01 20:53:08 We dont need oil and gas for f’ing fuel. lubricants yes. fuel no. might as well strap a wood burning stove on your tail gate. Electric cars, trucks, boats, trains, and planes are perfectly viable and have been for decades.  Cornyn is an old white dinosaur and should join them.
4587 2018-07-01 20:53:03 Simanyi evn cooking oil tax increased.......expecting a  rise in Rolex prices...:What a sad country!..
4588 2018-07-01 20:52:38 Snake oil!
4589 2018-07-01 20:52:36 England must surely fancy themselves. Bigger question is can they put it together when it counts. Pressure + England is like oil and water.
4590 2018-07-01 20:52:24 They came out smelling amazing. That anticipation is driving me nuts. I gotta eat it to see if my handy work, worked out. The oil looked and smelled fantastic  AND I GOT MORE LEFT OVER TO GLAZE ON MY CHICKEN AND WAFFLE DINNER
4591 2018-07-01 20:52:17 Was just about to go to jail for a oil change..
4592 2018-07-01 20:52:02 It's no Corrib Oil deli.
4593 2018-07-01 20:51:57 I made a 'Mediterranean Roast' today. All plant-based apart from some halloumi. A big pan of roasted roots with plenty of rosemary, garlic and olive oil ... what's not to like!
4594 2018-07-01 20:51:50 People wait up to 12 hours in food lines and walk away with maybe a can of beans.

Democratic socialism has destroyed Venezuela, a country with the largest reserves of oil on the planet, a country rich in minerals and other resources.They now have warehouses of rotting fruit.
4595 2018-07-01 20:51:37 "If"
4596 2018-07-01 20:51:35 This is misleading, the company in question has no activity in Congo and no plans to drill or has received any permissions to drill for oil in Virunga. Otherwise completely accurate article.
4597 2018-07-01 20:51:24 #Tehran has vowed to 'defeat' attempts to curb its oil revenues by allowing private companies to export it. #Iran also reminded #SaudiArabia that it was bound to an #OPEC agreement to only boost exports collectively
4598 2018-07-01 20:51:19 Oh, me too, olive oil is great.
4599 2018-07-01 20:51:06 My wife tried that #necklace #gimmick Total snake oil! #babies #momshopping #webmd
4600 2018-07-01 20:51:06 Every time I fire up my bike all the smoke goes directly into my neighbors yard. I wonder if they enjoy the smell of castor oil and race fuel or they just don't want to talk to me. #2smoker
4601 2018-07-01 20:50:32 Olive oil, garlic, Italian seasoning. Cut into small pieces, cook on medium heat. 
4602 2018-07-01 20:50:30 Trump pulled out of Iran deal to reinstate sanctions thus prevent them from selling oil. He rewarded the Saudis and other Arab nations so they can control oil prices. Without Iran, oil price goes up!
4603 2018-07-01 20:50:12 The new Lush foundation is 45% COCONUT OIL. Enjoy your breakout!
4604 2018-07-01 20:50:10 Works for me too. Helps reduce the itch and brings the oil to the surface to help you recover faster.  Go to the Rx now and buy some.
4605 2018-07-01 20:49:58 @papushatech - is the perfect technology to destroy oil refineries residues around the world! #Papusha #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin #Blockchain
4606 2018-07-01 20:49:47 Love it! I didn't even know who this justice was, now I kinda love him!

5) Lagos now confirmed as Oil producing state
6) Reconstruction of rail lines
7) Apapa Wharf road been construction by Dangote with Tax relieve by Fed govt.
8) Lagos produced the most powerful Minister in PMB's government
9) National Stadium will soon be**
4609 2018-07-01 20:49:23 If my girl was awake she'd be so pissed because her and football are water and oil 
4610 2018-07-01 20:49:22 Look into cannabis oil!
4611 2018-07-01 20:49:18 Q said that Hillary funneled some of the Russian Uranium to Syria to ignite a war so they could maintain their investments overseas (Genie Oil). The US used the DS gas attack as a cover to take out unsuspecting DS targets in Syria.
4612 2018-07-01 20:49:15 also, didn’t the Koch brothers father build oil refineries to the Nazis?
4613 2018-07-01 20:49:07 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
4614 2018-07-01 20:48:59 Makes sense to them.
4615 2018-07-01 20:48:55 I've said it before, and I'll say it again... this cough seriously needs to cough off! Also, how long does it take for warm olive oil to fix my bloody ears?? It's a pain in the butt being deaf! 

Ugh. /rant over
4616 2018-07-01 20:48:41 Обожаю серии пенальти
4617 2018-07-01 20:48:41 I hope it's sooner than later.  No country wants our military within their borders.  It's all about natural resources (Oil, gas ...)
4618 2018-07-01 20:48:37 My coconut oil is liquid it’s so damn hot
4619 2018-07-01 20:48:25 @DrAhmedAlissa بشرتي دهنيه ، هل استخدم غسول للوجه free oil ؟؟

 هل صنفرة الوجه عند الحلاق مفيده للوجه ؟
4620 2018-07-01 20:48:25 I feel like there should be a monthly event at The Phoenix called "Bear Baiting" and it would involve a bear, oil, visqueen, and a few otters or chickens/twinks.
4621 2018-07-01 20:48:15 Bolivia is socialist yet their fiscal policy is very healthy. corruption is what kills both capitalist & socialist governments! Venezuela’s crisis was caused by many factors: sanctions, political corruption , overconfidence in oil revenues. Not supporting socialism. Just saying.
4622 2018-07-01 20:48:13 And all top of that you put tariffs on other countries. You do realize that most of the proucts in the U.S. is made by other countries. Samsung, LG, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, Nike Shoes, oil, Smh.
4623 2018-07-01 20:47:40 i put way too much oil in this pot its fine
4624 2018-07-01 20:47:30 Looks like I'll be learning to do an oil change soon
4625 2018-07-01 20:47:26 DS sites in the targeting zone belonged to Cheyney. Genie Oil. If you knew anything about Q, like you claim you do, you'd know they are only backing the people's revolution in Iran. The "nukes in Syria" isn't necessarily true.
4626 2018-07-01 20:47:19 @patmaroon
Don't go to Calgary.. You could imagine the spit in the face that would be to the oil faithful

Will miss you in Edm..... Still
4627 2018-07-01 20:47:13 An interesting point in this is that gas is never mentioned. These figures relate to oil only and we have for years pumped £billions of gas directly into the European grid by undersea pipeline without it coming onshore in UK
4628 2018-07-01 20:47:12 Now what media ... now what .... hahahha  TESLA taking over ... enjoy oil and gas your run on top is coming to an end.
4629 2018-07-01 20:46:50 Y'all know they make beard oil, right
4630 2018-07-01 20:46:41 No love. I just spray it with water and twist it with coconut oil

4634 2018-07-01 20:46:28 Olive oil.!! Literally put a few drops in your ear. Soak a cottonwool ball/pad in olive oil & pop it in your ear! Works every time for me! X

4637 2018-07-01 20:46:13 'Tonic' was always classically touted as a cure-all, but as soon as I fashion it up with some Gin I proceed to feel the whole next day like I'm going to die.

Watch out for those snake oil salesmen kids.
4638 2018-07-01 20:46:09 lol
4639 2018-07-01 20:45:55 It's drawing what seem like texture rich oil paintings! 
4640 2018-07-01 20:45:54 2 days ago, there is a defunct Shell Oil Company building where I'm at security guards call the police and tried to have me arrested I was arrested held overnight , the only thing actually missing was a old Samsung phone with a cracked up screen when you turned it on it had Fox
4641 2018-07-01 20:45:54 Roast the potatoes and asparagus. 
Slice the polenta and lightly sautée in olive oil. 
With the diced tomatoes, add Serrano peppers and olives for a sauce to top the polenta.
4642 2018-07-01 20:45:49 Dear whoever is behind this handle. 

What you have prayed for me, if it is true that I am protecting evil, so shall it be.

But if you were paid to cause commotion and division, read Psalms about the oil and water thing.
4643 2018-07-01 20:45:46 Mix 2 quarts unicorn tears with 2 tablespoons enchilada. Mix in Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve with salmon

4646 2018-07-01 20:45:11 my skin is breaking out and producing so much oil that america can invade me.
4647 2018-07-01 20:44:45 As a pot smoker... it’s something I use at night when desperate for sleep. My mom who is not a mmj user has had some great side effects from 1,000mg cannaboid oil.stops her tremors. It’s relaxes her subtly. I think we have a long way 2 go 2 make it even close to a pain relief 
4648 2018-07-01 20:44:44 Trump is unhinged. Just his tweet about Saudi Oil production that had to be walked back because of OPEC outrage is proof. He's not a big picture thinker, he won't listen to experts and other countries exploit it. He's the single biggest threat to the US
4649 2018-07-01 20:44:30 You are adding oil to the fire! I will probably get it. Then, I can blame you for tempting me. 
4650 2018-07-01 20:44:24 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your lavash, join our club!
4651 2018-07-01 20:44:23 Ginger and mint tea. Peppermint oil and other essential oil mixtures.
4652 2018-07-01 20:44:09 Home grown oil production?
Us distributors price gouging? 
Playing the world oil market game!
Not our first oil price rodeo!
US products can’t compete now with China!
US Foreign sales? Where?
US product product availablity info! Non-exsistent! 
eBay Us product sales? Dismissal!
4653 2018-07-01 20:44:05 i keep getting cravings to just Smell Coffee Beans.... esp espresso...... like omg when i have to clean out the hopper at night n i smell the good bean oil its like my fave smell besides gasoline. my other fave smell. i have one brain cell
4654 2018-07-01 20:43:52 Ye of little faith. The Oil WILL make the playoffs. I expect a division title, too.
4655 2018-07-01 20:43:49 What abt turkish oil wrestle?
4656 2018-07-01 20:43:48 Mr.Hennry we were in a broken situations for 25 years and all the output went in their pockets ... government and rule you spoke about has never worked for the people's interestes ..you will not know how deep and miserable the situations in the oil territories .. don't we deserve
4657 2018-07-01 20:43:42 Perhaps you mean the fish. Because I’ve taken the oil and it’s not working like whatever these dudes do.
4658 2018-07-01 20:43:41 DRC consulate office address number 9. 6312 S. Fiddlers Green Circle, Suite 210E, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111. Demonstrate. Raise Hell. No oil drilling in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Remember the Gulf of Mexico.
4659 2018-07-01 20:43:32 There are quotes to many reputable studies in both the links I provided .. Including a video from a world renowned heart specialist md who states why no oil. I'm not at my desk atm but seems if i have to reply with each link to each relevant study, it be tomorrow now as its late.
4660 2018-07-01 20:43:31 my dad works for an oil company so i get free gas 
4661 2018-07-01 20:43:00 After many years I have figured finally how to bake brownies correctly; don't follow the instructions on the box & use coconut oil instead of butter. My co-workers loved them 
4662 2018-07-01 20:42:59 Oil is there not sure why people are doubting this so much won’t be long now
4663 2018-07-01 20:42:49 It's all the fish oil.
4664 2018-07-01 20:42:30 Do you have extra oil in a jar, to keep your lamp burning? Do you understand the parable of virgins (Mt 25:1-13)? Do you know what to expect before Jesus appears?
4665 2018-07-01 20:42:28 NO ONE will ever be able to say again that OPEC is not political and sticks to technical/economic issues
Oil production has been weaponised -- only this time the weapon is pointed at Iran and is being wielded by the United States and Saudi Arabia
Quite a turn around from 1973 ...
4666 2018-07-01 20:42:18 Lmao. You that is rejecting oil company
4667 2018-07-01 20:42:14 They are getting so desperate.Sorry far left, damage is done! America is not buying your snake oil! You will be jailed for your crimes. When grandpappy Bush dies, you shall be exposed. Remember folks, there all one in the same
4668 2018-07-01 20:42:05 Would this also make the road blindingly bright during daytime?
4669 2018-07-01 20:42:05 The oil stuff is in my hair and I feel gross
4670 2018-07-01 20:41:53 Its summer, ladies. Please lay off the perfume. Perfume oil is where its at. Or even sunscreen. Anything is better than being overly perfumed. 
4671 2018-07-01 20:41:46 Is it possible that Rieder signed for 1 year with the Oil knowing that if one of Russell/Sekera are moved next year and he plays well this season he could potentially sign for another 2-3 years in 2019-20? Strome and Nurse should be taken care of in the next few weeks so...
4672 2018-07-01 20:41:43 Yes, Virginia. Even pubes get dried out. Coconut oil your entire wetworks down.
4673 2018-07-01 20:41:32 The cost of oil (Holy Spirit) is time! The cost of the presence and power of God in our lives is the time we are willing to exchange to seek Him.

@pastorbrady
4674 2018-07-01 20:41:28 This is the type of heat that turns your coconut oil into liquid form
4675 2018-07-01 20:41:18 So my brother and I had a deal. He’s gonna cut the potatoes and put them in the oil for French fries. And I just have to take them out. Oh my sweet Lord.

these are the ingredients for a villain, fyi
4677 2018-07-01 20:41:08 Actually, Israel is saving Syrians while the Syrian leadership & Rebel groups slaughter each other. Israel has no desire to try to dig for oil in Syria, but please feel free to spread your bullshit.

4681 2018-07-01 20:40:27 I gotta wake up at 4 in the morning. Clean my house. Do a couple more interviews for Long John Silver’s. Replace 3 tires, get an oil change, do laundry, and drive to Des Moines. If anybody has some good ol’ Iowan meth laying around let me know
4682 2018-07-01 20:40:26 Mavis Leno was a driving force in changing the opinion of U.S. President Bill Clinton and the executives of the now defunct oil company Unocal Corporation concerning the Taliban, after Leno had shed light on the group's treatment of women.  There's more to Leno than we know.
4683 2018-07-01 20:40:24 Just done a monster leg massage with the oil I mixed a few weeks ago. It still smells amazing.

4688 2018-07-01 20:40:01 Should the fryer be on?  And should there be oil in it?

Directions unclear.
4689 2018-07-01 20:39:58 Yeah, what David said.  Confluence of uncoordinated interests.  Like, if I am selling munitions, and you're a neocon, and Jim wants the oil rights.  History is the vector sum of aggregated self interest.
4690 2018-07-01 20:39:57 @Jo_Bond @washingtonpost   thk god for new zealand...3 islands away from any madness.... except oil!
4691 2018-07-01 20:39:52 Hah! Alberta recorded the fastest expansion among the 10 provinces. Gross domestic product grew by 4.9 per cent, the oil-producing province recovering from two straight years of falling output following the collapse of oil prices.

4694 2018-07-01 20:39:39 Is CBD oil legit tho? I have a lot of questions.
4695 2018-07-01 20:39:38 Did a DIY tuneup job on motorcycle after decades.  Cleaned carbs, replaced oil and air filters, switched to Synthetic oil, new tech E3 spark plugs. Now engine purrs like a cat :-)
4696 2018-07-01 20:39:36 Probably for the same reason you can't smoke in an oil refinery.. Lol.
4697 2018-07-01 20:39:35 Put baby oil in y’all bath water skin be feeling like a baby
4698 2018-07-01 20:39:26 It's probably not ugly but if it is, it's the oil...and the paint
4699 2018-07-01 20:39:22 Imma see what I can do come next week. Idk about clove oil for severely cracked teeth / open wound type stuff? But for general toothaches it can be a godsend, available in teeth section of any ol pharmacy. It's just like, a numbing agent.
4700 2018-07-01 20:39:21 Frist full day vegetarian soon to be vegan, my body rejects and doesn't process the meats oil, eggs are not a problem like Burger and poultry. I miss cheesebergers.

4702 2018-07-01 20:38:44 How much oil is sitting still in tankers offshore that the speculators are not selling until the price climbs to where they make a very handsome profit?
4703 2018-07-01 20:38:42 —Baking soda 
—Apple cider vinegar
—Lemon juice
—Tea tree spring oil
—Coconut oil
—Salt
—Aloe vera 
—Olive oil
4704 2018-07-01 20:38:31 I heard this all the time growing up Catholic. “Did you know the penalty for stealing a chicken under Henry viii was to be boiled in oil? Torturing someone to death for not believing in your religion doesn’t sound so bad now, does it?”
4705 2018-07-01 20:38:27 He bites his lip as he rubs the lotion under her bikini straps. How he would love to rub massage oil on her in the bedroom. His hands run down her back and around to her stomach. "I can't keep my hands off of you" he whispers
4706 2018-07-01 20:38:27 Venezuela....rich oil country...disaster.  Cuba disaster....dont see anyone overrunning their borders except to leave.
4707 2018-07-01 20:38:26 I used the coupon that I received from Influenster “free” to get my country crock with sunflower oil and it tast delicious. Oh and did I mentioned that it is also healthy @CountryCrock @Influenster #CountryCrockSunflower #Contest #Complimentary
4708 2018-07-01 20:38:24 Ancient Rome had social programs one was Annona for food shortages. People were issued tokens, called tesserae (= to food stamps) and they went with containers to government warehouses where they received their portions including pork, oil,  & baked bread from government bakeries
4709 2018-07-01 20:38:14 Don't need bitchin smartphones when you got oil
4710 2018-07-01 20:38:06 Probably zero. The closest he’s been to Latin American manual labor was walking up a flight of stairs to Chipotle.
4711 2018-07-01 20:37:58 David was the 8th son of Jesse. 7 sons passed under the hand of Samuel completing a cycle. However, the 8th son was not invited to the gathering. He’s the outlier that was called, and it was on his head that oil was poured.The Lord has a tendency to anoint outliers and outsiders.
4712 2018-07-01 20:37:53 Congrats Donnie you lied about Saudi Arabia pumping more oil and telling Republicans to pass immigration bill. 2 easily provable lies in 1 day
4713 2018-07-01 20:37:53 has anyone used castor oil on their hair before?? if you have what were the benefits???
4714 2018-07-01 20:37:47 The muhjadin were created by the US because the secular Afghan govt was friendly to the Russia, the secular govt of Iran was overthrown because they werent selling oil to the US. The south American govts overthrown because US companies did not want to pay the taxes they owned
4715 2018-07-01 20:37:24 13 million...Lets ask the question, McDavid or Tavares?
4716 2018-07-01 20:37:18 If you don't want oil on your sandwhich DON'T SAY OIL
4717 2018-07-01 20:37:14 why is my oil painting so ugly
4718 2018-07-01 20:37:13 Goya oil will finish in the market
4719 2018-07-01 20:37:03 Wrong. Asia and US benefit, and oil oligarchs. Every Canadian just spent 1250$ on an overpriced pipeline.
4720 2018-07-01 20:37:03 Jeremy as you have been told i am friends with two people in the field, one works in Texas and UK for Amercan oil. Im inclined to think he knows what he talks about.

4724 2018-07-01 20:36:27 And who is arming the Houthi Rebels- innocent Iran! That Shia and Sunnis cannot make peace even in 21st century is a shame. Both sides to blame. Of course USA takes advantage of it- guaranteeing energy-oil-to its citizens; Israeli interests(I love jews,Israel but hate lobbies)

4728 2018-07-01 20:36:10 The future today. just in time production increase as oil hits $70 per barrel.  I am buying 100 more TSLA shares now!
4729 2018-07-01 20:35:40 Baba after how many yrs of abolition of slave trade and end of colonialism. Africans always giving excuses as usual. I hope u know Nigeria discovered crude oil after Independence and our economy was thriving after Independence wit just agriculture before oil.
4730 2018-07-01 20:35:39 yesterday I put too much peppermint essential oil in the bathtub that I was cold in steaming hot water - weirdest sensation ever
4731 2018-07-01 20:35:36 Amen brotherly!!   Na you oooh, Oil money!!!
4732 2018-07-01 20:35:34 Is the webuye paper factory in use? Who should supply us with sugar? Why do not we refine the Turkana oil in Kenya?
4733 2018-07-01 20:35:30 Did you know that ducks secret oil from a gland near their butt so they can make themselves aquaphobic?
What I’m saying is that maybe xeno goku is part duck which explains his highlights on his fur. It was a cause of goku secreting oil from his gland and lathering himself up
4734 2018-07-01 20:35:21 Nigeria must evolve, revolutionize,  industrialize and give opportunities to capable people with knowledge and the  will to put the country on a path of sustainable growth and development. Oil money is opportunistic revenue. It breeds corruption, laziness, exclusion & poverty.
4735 2018-07-01 20:35:16 OK! I went to the store and acquired the 500mg CBD oil, about to test it because my stomach is really saying no to another dose of ibuprofen.

私も出たが
4740 2018-07-01 20:34:21 YES I wonder how explicit Pompeo was with Falih about U.S. expectations for more oil? Did Pompeo give a blunt message? Did Falih hear it? Or did Trump simply think the ministers were being too cautious?
4741 2018-07-01 20:34:16 If you think a robust and growing economy is a good thing, then you think that’s good.
And again, Democrats can’t spend an entire decade restricting oil & gas operations, then claim victim when prices rise.
If demand grows and supply declines, prices go up.
4742 2018-07-01 20:34:12 The news media never lets the truth get in the way of a good headline or story
4743 2018-07-01 20:34:10 so i couldn't breathe properly through my nose and we have this japanese healing oil at home that you can rub on your chest but a tiny bit ran down my chest and under my boob AND IT'S BURNING LIKE CRAZY
4744 2018-07-01 20:34:07 One idea that has been discussed is how to make the people who protest for something actually do it themselves. For example, don’t like oil, don’t use it, don’t like plastic, don’t use it, don’t like CO2 don’t make any, stop exhaling.
4745 2018-07-01 20:34:05 I think you're allowing those Oilers colours to bleed through 
4746 2018-07-01 20:34:03 Border was more secure before 45 got ahold of it. All those resources being diverted to asylum seekers has left the rest of it vulnerable.
Adding $2T to the debt and getting into trade wars are damaging. Dow had worst 1st half since 2010. Economists afraid.
Oil&gas prices rising.
4747 2018-07-01 20:33:55 Just another tribe like big oil or big labor.
4748 2018-07-01 20:33:50 I hate the smell of raw coconut oil
4749 2018-07-01 20:33:38 Because something happened in the #oil market and the Russians are celebrating, right?
4750 2018-07-01 20:33:31 Dear Mr. Batmanghelidj with all due respect are you following the events in Iran? Do you see people’s situation  all over the country specially Khorramshahr where people are dying of thirst???? I don’t see you tweeting about that and questioning where our oil money is being spent
4751 2018-07-01 20:32:50 The smell of lavender oil intoxicates me

4754 2018-07-01 20:32:13 I love to oil that ass before I eat em
4755 2018-07-01 20:32:02 People want permission to be hateful racist, sexist, homophobes again, and his success is that he's giving it to them, wrapped in the feel-good of pop-psychology self-help and delivered via faux-intellectual word-salad to make them feel smart. The perfect snake oil recipe.

4758 2018-07-01 20:31:42 The meeting earlier this week between @SecPompeo and Saudi #oil minister @Khalid_AlFalih is even more interesting after Trump’s comments (Pompeo ran the @CIA before the @StateDept).

4761 2018-07-01 20:31:05 I know they can lay hands during rites of healing (as can any lay person authorised to do so) but I have ever only known priests to anoint with oil.
4762 2018-07-01 20:31:03 The government of Sweden has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Stacy Keibler in a gauze wig.
4763 2018-07-01 20:31:02 Ok I may have never seen butter + salt used in rice in my life but.... white rice + soy sauce + sesame oil + sesame seeds 
4764 2018-07-01 20:30:59 You probably need better motor oil for the negativity. 

But seriously, who do we trade for without giving up the farm?
4765 2018-07-01 20:30:43 @PrestonHoodChev I don't know who schedules appts for your customers but they're misleading people. I was told that a tire rotation was free with an oil change but was charged for both. When I asked they told me the safety insp was what was free and that's a $50 value.
4766 2018-07-01 20:30:38 Inversion ceremony complete, crimson pinpricks appear & bubble up on Saul’s skin. “What did you do to me!” he screams, as the dots erupt, spewing like tiny oil strikes. He coughs a spat of blood & his body racks in agony as his internal organs migrate toward his throat.

4779 2018-07-01 20:29:06 And while the Syrian government is busy trying to quell a civil war, Israel is attempting to settle some of that Syrian territory it occupied and to dig for the oil that is there. No wonder they want this horror to continue, maybe it keeps Syria too busy to fight them off, no?
4780 2018-07-01 20:28:58 So we're all up to speed:

North Korea hasn't denuclearized

4786 2018-07-01 20:28:05 Imran to give a final blow to pml you must destroy pml farmers vote by having an urgent agricultural measures to bring rural farm economy.plenty of scope to increase self sufficient in edible oil and saving billions of dollars in import of palm oil and soyabean

4797 2018-07-01 20:27:10 I actually stopped what I was doing to do some research as I was intrigued and found that as you say, all this study does is SUGGEST but that's it. A suggestion is not a fact and there are too many studies to show that olive oil is beneficial.

4821 2018-07-01 20:23:21 It’s still oil  RT @queennefertitty: Bro olive oil is 120 calories a tablespoon. How in the fuck
4822 2018-07-01 20:23:19 If you MAKE a problem -you don’t get to BRAG that you’re solving it -family separation, oil prices, cabinet picks.    I could go on...
4823 2018-07-01 20:23:18 I can normally spot a Constable, even if the image of him today being old fashioned - but I think he was actually pretty dynamic for his time & now. His oil sketches & drawings are incredible. Nice combination Sebald/Constable {who so effected by place would like Sebalds work!}
4824 2018-07-01 20:23:17 MOD prevent oil exploration in the Firth of Clyde as oil rigs would be a hazard for submarines so quite what it would make of such a bridge I don't know especially given they know how much munitions etc are dumped in the area.
4825 2018-07-01 20:22:55 Como q el pueblo se está cansando de las patitas del Pit,de la porquería de gas oil q nos roba Ancap,los buenos frenteamplistas,hartos...
4826 2018-07-01 20:22:52 
4827 2018-07-01 20:22:51 I’ll bring oil
4828 2018-07-01 20:22:15 Gotta oil ourselves up & slip out they arms
4829 2018-07-01 20:22:04 I live by the boarder near buffalo and the trucks that have been pulling in here and there is a lot of them at this oil refinery from the states also the hydro made here and Quebec 80% goes to the states
4830 2018-07-01 20:21:57 MY week!
Saudi Arabia raised oil output by 2 million barrels!
US Steel is going to open 6 new plants!
NK is getting rid of ALL their nukes!
I demand an immagration bill but not the republican imm. bill
I guarantee you everybody that ever bought a Harley-Davidson voted for Trump!
4831 2018-07-01 20:21:48 tell me why this older adult male staying at my lake house with my family has watched me rub tanning oil on my chest, commented on the small sunburn on my boobs, and watched me rub tanning oil on my butt and immediately looking away when i catch him staring... #creepstatus
4832 2018-07-01 20:21:48 And guess what these Republican candidates are running on, property tax relief if they really cared about residents, they’d have done something about it before now and run on it. Don’t put your hopes in the hands of these liars. They work for big corporations, big oil donors
4833 2018-07-01 20:21:46 His claims of new US Steel plants and Saudi Arabia expanding oil  production aren't lies, they're delusions.
4834 2018-07-01 20:21:46 Oil pens are my go to, flower is for special occasions #adulting

4836 2018-07-01 20:21:13 Sadly the Gulf of Mexico has been full of mercury from that BP oil rig explosion for years..we're still brave enough to eat from the oceans(crazy humans) 
4837 2018-07-01 20:21:11 Simpler theory Sir,

Everything Trudeau does  CDN dollar (via  biz exports):

-Trash NAFTA
- Stop Oil
- Green burden 
- Higher taxes N Debt

Soros hedges - shorts specific currencies

Not Votes but MONEY!

4843 2018-07-01 20:19:38 Had such a wonderful oil change experience with @Take5_OilChange
4844 2018-07-01 20:19:29 I’ve tried lavender oil, vinegar ,tea tree and lemon. Had to get a trap in the end 
4845 2018-07-01 20:19:28 Any sanction that prevents Iran from selling its oil and thus reinvesting that money back into its country is an easy one to see. See that don’t have a globalist federal reserve that can just print off paper when ever they need money, they have to rely on natural resources
4846 2018-07-01 20:19:20 slice aubergine, courgette, peppers, roast in oil at 180 for half an hour. wilt spinach in butter, cook sliced mushrooms and onion in a pan. beschamel is soy milk and butter heated up then whisk in flour. reduce tomatoes for red sauce. then just layer all that into lasagne :)
4847 2018-07-01 20:19:08 reccommending "organic refined coconut oil" to make "healthy" fry bread (ignoring the health myths) is like the exact opposite of why fry bread is a culinary tradition. its fuck-you bread. this is what the government gives, this is what nourishes spirits and souls and bodies.
4848 2018-07-01 20:19:02 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
4849 2018-07-01 20:19:00 How is the US not within their right to impose sanctions on a country that they don't see eye to eye with (govt wise)? Why would I not do that? You're talking about Chavez but he is long gone and not to mention that the mismanagement of funds and the state-owned oil company (2)
4850 2018-07-01 20:18:35 Trump is creating the Space Force to siphon oil from the sun and you can’t convince me otherwise
4851 2018-07-01 20:18:33 DRC consulate office address number 5. 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue N. W., Suite 407, Washington D. C. 20006. Demonstrate. Raise Hell. No oil drilling in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Remember the Gulf of Mexico.
4852 2018-07-01 20:18:21 I collected Garbage Peel Kids and Bazooka bubble gum comics as a kid. Meme coins resemble the same thing and people know it, it is a small subculture, it holds more value than snake oil cryptos.  @ummjackson @LupeCoin @piedpipercoin @pepedapp @dogecoin
4853 2018-07-01 20:17:53 I feel he saves extra saucy jabs just for the Oilers that go beyond normal commentary as a journalist. As soon as the Oilers show weakness, he’s Jonny on the Spot to point it out and how terrible they are. My opinion.
4854 2018-07-01 20:17:43 Maybe. I thinks she is probably pretty deep in  oil’s pockets. I also think the Trumpers would be a problem. Yesterday wasn’t bad here, but phony preacher dude was a lot pounder and more aggressive, and it looks like they have been getting violent nationally.
4855 2018-07-01 20:17:36 Or you could stop #TheWarOnSolar you clown. #Solar #SolarJobs #RenewableEnergy #SolarJobs employ twice as #Coal. #Trump is buying oil from his campaign sponsors.

4857 2018-07-01 20:17:15 Hi, Claire. We are sorry to see this! To remove it, we recommend that you take a cotton ball, saturate it with baby oil or coconut oil and hold it in place for several seconds to saturate the area, then wipe the product off. Follow up with a makeup remover wipe.
4858 2018-07-01 20:17:07 Reciprocity is a 2 way street and @JustinTrudeau just put tariffs on 13B Worth of American goods. Some North Korea, Russia, and oil too — LMK your thoughts? @CNN heading to you on this sweltering Sunday
4859 2018-07-01 20:17:02 Roughly, yes. Moreso started with British-owned Iranian Oil demanding that the British protect their monopoly/slave-labour "rights" Iran, and then the British seeking US support to stage a coup. 

Just another example of US destroying/destabilizing the Midddle East all for $$.

4861 2018-07-01 20:16:36 #SouthAfrica imports crude oil from Iran and if it continues doing so after US sanctions deadline of November the US will do what is required to penalize SA. SA also has military agreements with Iran.  Not good for SA to support this vile regime!
4862 2018-07-01 20:16:25 What this based on the oil being $200 a barrel again 
4863 2018-07-01 20:16:25 @Scottymechanic just watched your video on car’s that burn oil. Very interesting. I was wondering What’s your thoughts on the 90’s Firebird & Trans Am engines?
4864 2018-07-01 20:16:15 Aloe Vera gel + peppermint oil=smooth clear skin 
4865 2018-07-01 20:16:01 Resolved in as much as he's pressing for more oil not that SA agreed to any more than monitoring the situation and increasing as per last weeks OPEC's agreement which is precisely what the WH and SA statements post tweet described
4866 2018-07-01 20:15:58 “Karun is my blood, Khuzestan is my life” “A drop of water decreases, Ahwaz will rise” “Oil and gas you looted, water you stole, nothing left till you take our blood  #BloodForWater
4867 2018-07-01 20:15:57 South Africa is not the only country that has recently had to hike their fuel prices. Many countries have had to do the same because the price of oil went up. You can go ahead and burn your stuff but it's your fellow country men who will be affected.

4870 2018-07-01 20:15:12 Is the Saudi leadership keen on pumping out more and more oil now partly because it doesn’t think there will be much demand 40-50 years from now?
4871 2018-07-01 20:15:02 How interesting, the oil search in Bida Basin is a futile effort. Why not develop  proven to reserves in the Niger Delta.

4875 2018-07-01 20:14:27 Take into account that the KRG uses a large portion of that money to pay the oil producers that work there to pump that oil.
4876 2018-07-01 20:14:10 Salutations, it's Olive Oil. I've been thinking if after all these moments you'd like to give me your advice.
4877 2018-07-01 20:14:08 Interesting. But US doesn’t tolerate imports of Iranian oil. How is this all really fitting into American policy toward counties that want to have beneficial ties with Iran?
OR - is US willing to give room to India to use all options to counterbalance Chinese influence?
4878 2018-07-01 20:14:05 a country much better than it would have been under corrupt western leadership embezzling the county. maybe they wouldn’t be starving if the US wasn’t tanking the price of oil out of spite. but nah, it’s bc chavez actually gives a shit about people that they’re under siege
4879 2018-07-01 20:14:02 Economists are the modern snake oil salesmen all claiming to have a cure. Bear in mind that 75% of £1.7tr debt is owed to pension and insurance funds. We're enslaved to our own debt by proxy. Smoke and mirrors.

4892 2018-07-01 20:10:57 I'm not disappointed. He had a chance to go to war for oil in Syria, and for their ores. He chose limited response in Syria and a carrot-and-stick approach in NK. He's no warmongering neocon. He gave peace a chance.

4911 2018-07-01 20:08:52 Those look delicious. I'd #veganize it with @nutiva  coconut oil but they look amazing
4912 2018-07-01 20:08:43 They have really had us over a barrel...no pun intended... We hope to see our own oil being produced more here in the USA.  Would be great not to be at all defendant on any foreign oil...

4917 2018-07-01 20:08:00 This video describes one very small study. It is definitely not conclusive and there are several studies that show the exact opposite - that olive oil is good for you. It doesn't seem to me that this is well researched at all.
4918 2018-07-01 20:07:37 Probably does get dirty either. I don't suppose a layer of dirt, tire marks & oil will affect it..

4924 2018-07-01 20:06:14 Oriana Fallaci, in her book 'The Force of Reason' describes the process of how the invasion started. Qaddafi and Boumédiène the mid '60s promised Europe a steady & secured supply of oil, if they admitted 'workers' from the moslem oil producing nations. Europe took the bait.

8. Upgrade your regular towels to exfoliating fabric
4927 2018-07-01 20:05:53 We need cheaper fares. When oil prices go up they feel the need to increase fares but when oil prices go down prices still go up get back to reality so everyday people can actually use the network
4928 2018-07-01 20:05:35 And! Major American cities used to have huge electric tram public transit systems, until GM, Standard Oil, Phillips Petroleum and Firestone got together, bought a controlling interest, and gutted all of it, forcing people to buy cars.
4929 2018-07-01 20:05:22 But we supported revolution in Venezuela for the same reason we brought down Mossadegh in Iran. And our company Chevron Texaco has murdered how many native tribes in Ecuador by destroying their pristine rainforest with oil waste dumping?? Backed by the US government no less

4933 2018-07-01 20:05:04 The real issue is Trump thinks Saudi maintaining 2mb/d spare capacity = OPEC manipulating oil markets upward. If they put that spare capacity online and on the market tomorrow... oil would shoot to $100. The reservation of spare capacity manipulates markets downward.

4937 2018-07-01 20:04:30 man, this was a powerful response. What’s happening in Venezuela has been really sad, especially because I liked Chavez when I was a kid. Plus you guys have all that oil.

4987 2018-07-01 20:01:00 so when all these "master" artists paint the same oil portrait of the virgin mary & baby jesus they get put in the friggin louvre, but the 1000s of drawings i made of my anime fursonas in diapers eating each other are just "deeply disturbing" & "should never see the light of day"
4988 2018-07-01 20:00:44 You can drink oil and be happy and alright
4989 2018-07-01 20:00:39 Of course, not France, as good Americans are supposed to believe France is worthless! Hey didn't W. Bush acted as such? And who want "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" anyway? Isn't greed and oil better anyday?

4992 2018-07-01 20:00:29 I prefer the grill version.  Not as tough,  smokey,  easier to keep juicy.  If you get a chance try cubing it marinating in lemon,  thyme,  olive oil.  Then kabob it with veg. Serve with herb rice. Good n healthy to.
4993 2018-07-01 20:00:18 #petrolhike between 2010 and 2015, crude oil average was more than $80. Now oil is around $80, a bit cheaper but petrol is expensive. #ThumaMina wokunuka.
4994 2018-07-01 20:00:08 @theresa_may you have to STOP British Oil Company Soco International from drilling in Virunga National Park and help save the endangered Mountain Gorillas and all the wild life there, there are some places man should not destroy this is one of them
4995 2018-07-01 20:00:04 Why do they say flax seed oil is a better source of Omega 3s? Because flax O3s are all short chain, fish (and alege) have long chain omegas which are what we actually need
4996 2018-07-01 19:59:55 That table needs some oil
4997 2018-07-01 19:59:55 SAME SAME SAME i was so scared of using oil for so long

5002 2018-07-01 19:59:19 Sorry to see Eric go. Was a good soldier for the Oil.
5003 2018-07-01 19:59:08 Like Lady I’m gonn buy you some peppermint oil . 
5004 2018-07-01 19:59:08 Anxiety patients, keep lavender essential oil with you at all times. Put it behind your ears and on your wrists. Put some on your pillow. It helps a lot.
5005 2018-07-01 19:59:06 We don’t have the tanker ports we would need to sell oil elsewhere. 99% of Canada’s exported oil goes to the US, most via pipeline.
5006 2018-07-01 19:58:57 Damn I hate waiting on an oil change.

5009 2018-07-01 19:58:44 DRC consulate office address number2. 12 Greenway Plaza, Suite 1100, Houston, Texas. Demonstrate. Raise Hell. No oil drilling in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Remember the Gulf of Mexico.
5010 2018-07-01 19:58:35 you make a claim that is because there's a fear of running out of oil,  how about the fact that we're destroying our environment and making it inhospitable...
5011 2018-07-01 19:58:34 A drop of plate oil wouldn't go a miss !!
5012 2018-07-01 19:58:29 Synthetic oil and premium gas. Can’t tell me it ain’t nice driving a smooth whip tho
5013 2018-07-01 19:58:04 For sure. They were the best with oil. I could stay in the Rijksmuseum for weeks just looking at painting details! Sigh. So beautiful.
5014 2018-07-01 19:57:54 Yes, I can believe that. All the dumb ones go to Edmonton. All the smart ones go to Calgary and become oil company CEOs. 
5015 2018-07-01 19:57:53 All these tanners are going to get Melanoma using baby oil to tan. Just stop. #BigBrother20 #bb20
5016 2018-07-01 19:57:39 I agree that fried oil tastes good.
5017 2018-07-01 19:57:35 Kale has a lot of benefits and a lot of minerals in it, however it doesn’t always taste nice. So one trend to follow is crunchy kale : you cook kale with loads of olive oil for five minutes and it tastes so much better!
5018 2018-07-01 19:57:19 Cannot wait for my cbd oil to arrive
5019 2018-07-01 19:57:12 Canadians love our neighbors in the states. This trade was NOT all Trumps fault! Trudeau wanted this, his goal is shut down oil&gas, coal fired plants (aluminium &steel). What better way to get it done, this way Canadians will say it was Trumps fault!

5022 2018-07-01 19:56:39 When the door squeaks a little oil or grease. Right?
5023 2018-07-01 19:56:31 I guess those people felt the same way when western people seeking for oil and diamonds invaded illegally their homeland and their culture, lives and heritage threatened and bla bla bla. Anyway, this will not improve your income, as long as the system (capitalism) doesn't change.
5024 2018-07-01 19:56:14 #forexnews Trump playing oil short this week.
5025 2018-07-01 19:56:12 Happy with Rieder, Brodziak, and Gravel.  I wonder if the Oilers try to sign an Orpik or another dman yet, and then having enough dmen, try to trade for a Nylander or Marner.  Was thinking the Oil could send a Nurse or Klefbom for probably Nylander as a core of a deal.
5026 2018-07-01 19:56:08 With a paprika, honey and garlic purée with an olive oil base ;)
5027 2018-07-01 19:56:05 Maybe affordable sensors can be had from the oil and  gas industry equipment sellers.
5028 2018-07-01 19:55:48 Again defra to stop ignoring one of the healthiest animal feeds on planet.

5029 2018-07-01 19:55:39 Saag is a generic catch-all term for green leafy veggies, palak is spinach. So saag could be spinach/mustard/etc and usually the fattening part is the paneer and the amt of cooking oil/ghee used
5030 2018-07-01 19:55:12 I spent a day with @fmassard in Priorat last October....if his wines are anything to go by (and they are), that will be delicious olive oil!
5031 2018-07-01 19:55:12 that’s normal for engine oil?
5032 2018-07-01 19:55:07 Borrowing for recurrent expenditure is my greatest challenge. We need to develop the country to oil business activities. I understand the part of FDIs, but I feel we have to take the right steps that will encourage investors to trust us with their fund.
5033 2018-07-01 19:55:02 Yep, got caught out by one myself. Are oil companies really so hard up they have to resort to these kind of con tricks?

5035 2018-07-01 19:54:45 Started using Amla beard oil to moisture my beard and my beard has never felt and looked healthier.
5036 2018-07-01 19:54:34 Farage is famously personable and approachable! All for the wrong reasons! Snake Oil salesman geberally have the gift of the gab!
5037 2018-07-01 19:54:33 Well, he didn’t want to sign with them at the time as the Oil were stacked on the wings. So they didn’t have much choice but t trade him.
5038 2018-07-01 19:54:29 If Clinton didn't slaughter children for her Oil Masters, she and everyone she knows would not be under the crosshairs of Americans.
5039 2018-07-01 19:54:16 Pretty much everything! Lemon oil, garlic, balsamic vinegar, rose vinegar, a few splashes of Tabasco and Cholula, Dijon mustard, oregano, thyme, Marjoram, Himalayan salt and Pepper with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.
5040 2018-07-01 19:54:09 A post apocalyptic Mad Max type movie taking place in the prairies where Maple Syrup is the new currency. So large oil tankers travelling through the country carrying maple syrup have to defend against the vile Canadian biker gang called "The bad d'Eh's".
5041 2018-07-01 19:53:50 Wow frozen bio oil is doing fucking numbers for this burn
5042 2018-07-01 19:53:49 The US gets most of its imported oil from,,,,,,,, Canada and Central America. You know, those countries Trump  is bad mouthing in his childish way . LOL
5043 2018-07-01 19:53:28 OMS book says flax seed oil is a better source anyway! I slosh it on everything now. But fish 3x a week is good for other reasons. I probably only eat fish once a week though
5044 2018-07-01 19:53:21 Is this why Republicans want such a strong military to support the 1% all across the globe and exploit countries for oil and precious metals and minerals it sure looks that way and with the EPA going the way it's going there going to leave America a polluted toxic dump for money
5045 2018-07-01 19:53:18 Funny because in 2016 a few prepper websites were predicting he would be "set-up" for the collapse of the economy. Deregulation, trade wars, oil dependence... had nothing to do with it 
5046 2018-07-01 19:53:18 I get my oil from Aphria. They are out of Ontario but came highly recommended by my med marijuana counselor.
5047 2018-07-01 19:53:14 The U.S. relies on Canada for 30% of its oil. So why wouldn’t Canada threaten to stop supplying the U.S. And  sell to the rest of the world, instead. 
Canada could also put tariffs on the billions of gallons of Fresh Water, that it channels to the U.S.
5048 2018-07-01 19:53:05 Agreed. Growing up my dad always made them with just pine nuts, olive oil, Parmesan, and rosemary. Everyone liked it but me.

5051 2018-07-01 19:52:59 She actually grew up in a modest neighborhood in Westchester with deep connections to Bronx where she was born and had relatives. Her family seemed to teeter between working class and lower middle class.

- king salman : yes sir of course majesty. 
True story.
5059 2018-07-01 19:52:00 Yes, we know that Jason aligns with moving tar sands oil from Canada to Minnesota. And that he agrees with President's decisions like issuing petroleum waivers at the cost of MN Soybeans.  Ending the Farm to Fleet biodiesel program at cost of US biodiesel. Oil only hurts MN
5060 2018-07-01 19:51:57 @CIA If you can not stop Moon Jae-in's economic cooperation, highway, railroad, etc. for Kim Jung-eun, stopping oil exports to Iran will not have any effect.

5062 2018-07-01 19:51:44 How to get clear skin easy and fast!
1. Drink a lot of water: water has been said to decrease amount of oil leading to the skin becoming very soft and moisture rather than being oily

5068 2018-07-01 19:51:12 Well, is that on Baghdad or on Erbil? If Erbil insists on makes deals with foreign companies and wants to export its own oil, is there any other way?

5075 2018-07-01 19:50:18 Those oil tycoons we use to read about in those Mills&Boon books
5076 2018-07-01 19:50:14 Oil traders, operate only on two things:  1 is greed, and 2 is fear. 

Oil traders neither know nor care about oil "facts. 

The oil Truth, to a trader, is what the other fellow he trades against believes, and how you (trader) can exploit that greed or fear for your own gain.

5084 2018-07-01 19:49:00 Ekiti just signed a rice deal with Lagos recently. These states all have their strengths. Crude rent is just the problem. Also, these oil states have money to throw around. A lot to make from them if states make good deals.

5086 2018-07-01 19:48:39 It's extremely hot today. Now mi know what its like when di chicken inna hot oil a fry.
5087 2018-07-01 19:48:32 I can give you tips even, that was my job from July 2016 to June 2017. But I could never wish for it, it wasn't by choice neither. Stick to 8-5 much better unless he's from the oil rich countries
5088 2018-07-01 19:48:28 Actually the number of East Coast Canadians who work in the Alberta Oil Industry is very high. Not all of Eastern Canada is blind to the plight of Oil workers.
5089 2018-07-01 19:48:07 @rajsengupta having some AMAZING results in terms of pain relief from #cbd oil. Worth looking into if you ever fancy doing that sort of trial!!!
5090 2018-07-01 19:48:07 A blend of Avocado pear, coconut oil or castor oil or olive oil and aloe vera and egg yolk  works magic
5091 2018-07-01 19:48:04 Rose essential oil is wonderful.
5092 2018-07-01 19:48:02 Oil you can do that in lieu of. the £20 challenge as your tips are pants!

5094 2018-07-01 19:47:35 Shout out to the wee woman in Morrisons who recommended I try Prevalin for my hayfever. It stings like hell when you first spray (peppermint oil) but oh... sweet relief!
5095 2018-07-01 19:47:30 Realities of oil pricing: flows from oil traders, not market fundamentals. 
Oil prices will go where the traders, who are rank speculators, push it.
5096 2018-07-01 19:47:26 @RoyalSaudiNews NINJAOA GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATO

1. PETROLEUM OIL HAS BEEN SHUT OFF SOME TIME AGO AND IT IS NOW LOCKED.
2. THERE WILL BE NO MORE PETROLEUM OIL ANYWHERE TO GET

....NINJAOA
5097 2018-07-01 19:47:18 "Of course~"
Neo started rubbing Yang's back with the oil, it felt warm, yet liquidity, it felt good on the skin
5098 2018-07-01 19:47:09 Solar energy  ,a 30kwh setup or more will set you back 50k and 100kwh solar setup around 150000 and the panels and batteries have a life span of about 25 years so stop worrying about Eskom and the evil oil industry my leader join the feature and prepare for the future...
5099 2018-07-01 19:46:53 That's just an interim solution. What are those rusty looking tankers doing on the road in the first place? Some of these oil corporations need to be held culpable.
5100 2018-07-01 19:46:49 It matters not that its extra virgin, I go on what the science surgests, which it shows that oil damages the arteries in our body, this includes any olive oil. I know this goes against tv cooking shows and mass marketing but the facts are clear. 
Please read the link I provided.
5101 2018-07-01 19:46:43 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
5102 2018-07-01 19:46:43 The "Oil Slick" is a shot. Can't remember the recipe though.
5103 2018-07-01 19:46:34 my coconut oil melted and it straight up looks like a jar of semen i'm sorry for this tweet in advance
5104 2018-07-01 19:46:31 I sometimes watch the webcam at LaPlata Mo train depot. Every day sand trains carrying tons of sand pass through going to the fracking sites for oil extraction. Literally tons and tons
5105 2018-07-01 19:46:27 Aint no oil field boo  ..... i just know 
5106 2018-07-01 19:46:27 Somebody really needs to investigate Trudeau. Was his rise to power financed by the Saudis as was Bush, via his fake oil company which actually produced no oil, and Obama during his educational history.
5107 2018-07-01 19:46:06 Only if you're doing it wrong! Saute the fuck out of it with garlic, olive oil, chili flakes and a hit of nutmeg and kale is amazing.

5112 2018-07-01 19:45:42 Probably time to explain the benefits of the oil change.......... :(
5113 2018-07-01 19:45:37 Some time ago I bought an oil  painting of two Spitfires shooting down a German Messerschmidt during WWII.  #BrexitBritain
5114 2018-07-01 19:45:34 Capture oil
5115 2018-07-01 19:45:33 There are nine offices where passports and visas can be gotten from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their minister of oil, of course, is a savage. tRUMP, Trudeau and now this creep whatever his name is. No oil drilling in Virunga. Following tweets will give addresses.
5116 2018-07-01 19:45:29 Broccoli is a disgusting tree from the darkest pits of hell (which, BTW, is probably where Tron players go).  Spinach gives you superpowers and is delicious when sauteed with garlic and olive oil.  No contest here.

5120 2018-07-01 19:44:27 The same reason why Kellyann constantly LIES and offers  alternative facts for Trump. Do you know that the President lied about speaking with the Saudi Prince regarding the increase in the production of Oil. No outcry from his base. Shameful
5121 2018-07-01 19:44:23 Oil production, April. (million barrels per day)

5130 2018-07-01 19:43:14 Oil need one of Yamo/JP to step up this year, they also need a bounce back year from Talbs, if they can get that and stay reasonably healthy we’ll have playoff hockey

5135 2018-07-01 19:43:00 Ethiopia began on Thursday its first-ever crude oil production under a test production scheme that will see initial production of 450 barrels of oil per day.
Ethiopia, a rather large country in east Africa, started production from oil fields in its southeast today.
5136 2018-07-01 19:42:44 Given the greed of the wealthy oil companies, I wouldn't count on gas prices coming down.
5137 2018-07-01 19:42:39 My love they are fighting over power not oil.
5138 2018-07-01 19:42:37 They act like we're against ALL immigration! No one is saying that. We want ILLEGAL immigration stopped. There's a difference. And all the legal immigrants I know are pissed that illegals get to step in front of the line ahead of those working their ass off to get here legally.
5139 2018-07-01 19:42:36 We've banned Nutella from our household and replaced it with a substitute with less palm oil. But generally it's totally OK to eat it straight from the jar.

5144 2018-07-01 19:41:49 You could substitute with lemon juice and olive oil, or some balsamic!
5145 2018-07-01 19:41:46 Yet 'astonishingly' no mention of this oil bonanza in GC Report! You'd think it was written be someone who didn't want Indy! If we're being honest this report didn't exactly kickstart the debate, it pretty much killed off the Indy dream which is why nobody wants to talk about it
5146 2018-07-01 19:41:18 Meaning the Chinese can build it, because they were going to build it anyway.  And India can get some oil.
5147 2018-07-01 19:41:07 I think he just has some heavy bags full of snake oil.
5148 2018-07-01 19:41:04 Those are oil based glues on the stickers. Get some lighter fluid, like for a zippo, rub it on the sticker, wait a minute and the stuff comes right off.
5149 2018-07-01 19:41:00 I swear Putin must have promised his boys some oil fields

5151 2018-07-01 19:40:43 From where to where?
5152 2018-07-01 19:40:40 Yes. As an apprentice on oil tankers it was my job to show the films , “All the presidents men” was a 4 reeler, I showed 1 3 2 4 and Nobody had a clue
5153 2018-07-01 19:40:39 Oil change complete @British_Airways - just need to refuel and load the catering - this will take another 90 minutes.
5154 2018-07-01 19:40:37 I bought an oil diffuser and it arrives tomorrow. I’m so excited 
5155 2018-07-01 19:40:36 US administration threatened to impose sanctions on Iran's business partners if they do not cut Iranian oil imports to "zero" by November 4, in an attempt to further isolate Tehran politically and economically.

5167 2018-07-01 19:39:27 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
5168 2018-07-01 19:39:25 You wish to castigate Musk as if he's dropping leaking oil tankers in the ocean, while simultaneously ignoring what he's done for making EV and solar viable - and the first space launch company to HAVE EVER RECYCLED A BOOSTER.  *He's already way ahead of everyone else recycling!*
5169 2018-07-01 19:39:10 hdshh i need to practice oil painting so badly but i dont have any pictures that i can reference :((
5170 2018-07-01 19:39:09 In 1978 my school had SNP and Labour give us a “talk” about Scotlands Oil. I was a Modern Studies student and I was (at 16) very angry that the whole political spectrum wasn’t represented. 40 years later...#indy2
5171 2018-07-01 19:38:53 I’m pleased with the sand paper they have now,I don’t see the oil or flames getting any better.
5172 2018-07-01 19:38:42 And they don’t even have the right agency

5177 2018-07-01 19:37:52 Impact on helicopter industry recover, airlines? @nytimes quotes Ctr on Global Energy Policy’s @JasonBordoff: “It’s certainly easy to imagine a scenario at this point where oil prices hit $100 again this year.”
5178 2018-07-01 19:37:51 Soco International is a vicious oil and gas corporation that has its offices in England and Not in U.S. They got permission to drill for oil in Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is where the wonderful Gorillas live. This is their home.

5183 2018-07-01 19:37:28 You are the enemy of the Iranian people and the friend of the criminal Islamic government of Iran and the Iranian people hate you. Because you only want Iran's oil and resources, not the freedom and welfare of the Iranian people
5184 2018-07-01 19:37:17 The UK is an island of coal the vast majority of which remains unmined and will always remain that way.

Understanding why that is would inform Nats as to why their predictions/hopes for oil revenues are so fundemtally and obviously flawed.
5185 2018-07-01 19:37:06 Akinyoa unam oil from head to toe hahaha
5186 2018-07-01 19:37:05 Picking you up but I think I need an oil change first
5187 2018-07-01 19:36:53 Still can’t understand how people don’t know how to change their oil or their battery
5188 2018-07-01 19:36:49 Sounds like the relationship was on thin ICE
5189 2018-07-01 19:36:30 I’m exhausted I almost wanna say f the oil change for one more day cause I need a nap 
5190 2018-07-01 19:36:28 Yes oh!! 
Soon @APCNigeria and their media boys will tell us how @MBuhari canceled the oil well contract @OfficialPDPNig gave out to @UN
That was why United Nations now said Buhari government is encouraging his terrorist brothers.

5195 2018-07-01 19:36:01 It’s all about negotiations.  Oil accounts for about 20% of your GDP.    Much more difficult to negoatiate with bulls that import and export trillions annually.

5207 2018-07-01 19:34:24 Exactly. And other than Nixon's headline trip in 72 China was not a trade factor. Oil politics were front center on commodity stage.
5208 2018-07-01 19:34:17 I would hear the same thing too. But I am oil I let all the hate slip from me . Still waiting and I know someone will see my worth . Love your pix both of y’all look amazing .
5209 2018-07-01 19:33:48 Injustice happens in different ways. Millions of Igbos killed in a civil war and we unlooked because we weren't Igbos, and it was a "war". They forcefully commandeered land because of ND oil, and we chilled because we weren't all from ND. They have come for the middle belt btw.
5210 2018-07-01 19:33:43 watching in horror as the folks at jiffy lube clean my car and give it an oil change as I know they’re thinking “when’s this bitch gonna get her life together”

5215 2018-07-01 19:32:44 While oil supply disruptions in Libya, Canada, and Venezuela are already underway and expected to be either moderately long-term (Libya) in some cases, or infinite in others (Venezuela), Iran’s supply disruptions, or export disruptions, have not yet materialized fully
5216 2018-07-01 19:32:27 If Reider plays consistently like he did against the Oil then he could be getting an extension.

5224 2018-07-01 19:31:54 “Fish oil, wine stains and the everyday hardship of life as the messiah in a desert town.. Hi, I’m Jesus, and you’re probably wondering how I keep my robes so white?”

5226 2018-07-01 19:31:38 I should have bought stock in oil companies when crude oil was l $50 a barrel , now it going back to $100 a barrel and I would be laughing to bank right now
5227 2018-07-01 19:31:24 Maybe - but centralization is destroying us so we need alternatives.

Maybe without oil we could avoid decentralization but we are where we are.
5228 2018-07-01 19:31:21 Dear white collar robber baron in chief, you spew lies like no other!  Top of your class.  Just because you believe this snake oil chant, doesn’t make any of it true.  Don’t unpack, and don’t steal anything when you are voted out.  Do your job, petty retaliations is not a job.

5234 2018-07-01 19:30:49 The oil pressure switch on my Rover SD1 is of the three prong variety. One prong makes the oil warning light appear. The other two form part of the circuit with the fuel pump. If the engine loses oil pressure, it breaks the circuit to cut the engine and prevent damage.
5235 2018-07-01 19:30:42 Today marks my one year anniversary of quitting my 14+ years corporate job as an oil & gas engineer, and decided to travel the world in a backpack, do what I love while earning a full time living online. #introvertwithalaptop

5244 2018-07-01 19:29:10 People sometimes forget that Ghana has oil because we don't see anything
5245 2018-07-01 19:29:08 Bro olive oil is 120 calories a tablespoon. How in the fuck
5246 2018-07-01 19:28:55 Nonsense. You have no control over Saudi oil production. And by the way, it’s “too” high, not to high.
5247 2018-07-01 19:28:42 Some pubs do have stickers, just haven’t seen orange ones. Sometimes I get them on the Monday booth giveaways. I use Goo-b-gone (orange oil) to get them off.

5249 2018-07-01 19:28:27 Well when you describe it like that. Haha. I’ll try olive oil. I have a back up copy that I bought so I can just switch covers if I have to.
5250 2018-07-01 19:28:21 Yeah they should probably close campgrounds and overnight stays for that reason. But banning people from poking around our own land seems like yet another way to sow apathy. Guarantee the oil wells aren’t being turned off and won’t be.
5251 2018-07-01 19:28:16 From Daily: Oil has been 1 place to park $$. Looking back from June 2017 til now, oil has risen by over 63%!
Last wk, $USO cleared the 200 wk mov avg for the 1st time since 2014. Major trend reversal. That puts oil high on the list of investment prospects 4 buying dips.
5252 2018-07-01 19:28:10 What?! No push for all those patriotic American jobs fracking to retrieve good old American oil? Perhaps #PresiDenseChump will make more money from overseas investments? As with ZTE, the priorities become clearer over time.
5253 2018-07-01 19:28:06 San Marzanos, sautéed onion and lots of fresh garlic, a bay leaf, good red wine, good olive oil, salt, red pepper flakes, dash of dried oregano and chopped fresh basil. And I put a sprinkle of sugar to tame acidity. Voila

5255 2018-07-01 19:27:50 En ese caso deberian advertir e informar previamente las condiciones en que debe ser usado el gas oil que venden, para la mayoria de los usos rurales seria inapropiado por lo tanto su calidad no es adecuada para nuestro pais y ademas caro.
5256 2018-07-01 19:27:41 A lil thread on the eclipse:

Our upcoming eclipse triad asks: are you a grape, a diamond, an olive, or a seed? What does it all mean? 

Grapes must be crushed to make wine
Diamonds form under pressure
Olives are pressed to release oil
Seeds grow in darkness

5258 2018-07-01 19:27:17 Iran and Saudi try'd to get Hurt the US through an Oil shortage but Trump let them know we have plenty of Oil that we only have to cut down our own export to other Countries and Russia has lots of oil to sell also..so Fuel prices should be going back down..They cannot beat Trump
5259 2018-07-01 19:27:08 Fresh oil

Helps you deal with the complexities of life, gain new (healthy) perspective, and shows you what’d you are and WHO God is
5260 2018-07-01 19:27:03 "Mutual respect"? That's rich coming from you. How about respecting the laws of our great country and stop blocking the pipeline. If it weren't for the foreign funding from US oil interests you wouldn't be remotely interested. You are a shaemeful & despicable politician. Resign.
5261 2018-07-01 19:26:55 Appreciated bro! 
5262 2018-07-01 19:26:47 I love Traeger rubs and seasoning. But I would not buy their pellets. Their pellets are 100% alder wood with oil added to wood. No matter if you buy mesquite, apple, or maple. Or anything in between. Just a heads up! Good smoking my friend!

5268 2018-07-01 19:26:07 I googled how to get it off. For me, olive oil worked on my copy of that new YA with the animal crackers about the animals that escape the private zoo starring a boy (lol my copy is not in the room with me).

5276 2018-07-01 19:25:34 Mike.. you're a big bhavna fan.. what does she put on her hair to make it so shiny and healthy? I heard she used almond oil and vitamin E oil on her skin
5277 2018-07-01 19:25:31 This guy is terrible.  He is causing the turmoil is Iran and Venezuela by blocking their shipments of oil !!!
5278 2018-07-01 19:25:12 Me: man I love olive oil and lime together. It’s my favorite salad dressing.

@nataliedelc: did you eat limes before meeting me? 

Me: yeah, cherry limeades
5279 2018-07-01 19:24:51 U.S. President Trump calls on Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production by 2 mmb/d to reduce global oil prices which have started inching back towards the triple digits. Trump mistakenly believes though that Saudi Arabia has the ability to sustainably increase its production.
5280 2018-07-01 19:24:50 Suspect not white and simply a deranged individual who was evicted. Prob has nothing to do with Trump or them being refugees,  just the closest ppl to lash out at.
5281 2018-07-01 19:24:50 Yeah, I can’t imagine there wouldn’t be oil at either of those places lol. I think skipping the mustard seeds will be fine
5282 2018-07-01 19:24:40 Getting an oil change and they need to hurry tf up!!! Sweating and shit
5283 2018-07-01 19:24:35 Iran has asked fellow OPEC members to “refrain from any unilateral measures”, warning that would undermine the unity of OPEC, following reports that Saudi Arabia has raised its oil production to a record high this month.
5284 2018-07-01 19:24:31 Your head get oil. 
5285 2018-07-01 19:24:16 Yeah, I mean that's why our legislature legalized it even though they're still very anti-cannabis, there were so many medical stories, especially after Sanjay Gupta started making documentaries about it, the people were like we want this oil!

5303 2018-07-01 19:22:34 Yes, silver typically follows oil. For one, higher production cost to manufacture like all other commodities. I think the reason silver and other commodities didnt respond to the oil move over the last two weeks was due to options expirations and the end of Q2.
5304 2018-07-01 19:22:31 Hatred for Islam and Muslims using this tragedy. Muslims can quote a litany of western imperialism in their countries if they wanted to score cheap political points. This isn’t the way to resolve issues but simply pouring oil on fire.

5315 2018-07-01 19:21:04 Lots of talk about that apparatus yesterday in the NXS race. If they mount it too close to the oil tank there's so much residual heat that the A/C basically doesn't function. It can only reduce air temp by about 20-30 degrees. Who wants 120F blowing on them??

5349 2018-07-01 19:16:48 What has changed in the last 24 months warranting the increase in price? Has the supply gone down or demand up? Shale is not resulting in the glut anymore? Hedge funds have taken a long position on oil? What underlying fundamental is driving this?

5359 2018-07-01 19:15:50 @MFollowill has been a pleasant part of this world cup compared to others (like Perez). Followill has been the Mavs play-by-play for years, calls FC Dallas games and is going to be a mainstay at the top of Fox, or another network, for years. Just as nice in person as well!
5360 2018-07-01 19:15:30 Left the House without Beard oil 
5361 2018-07-01 19:15:30 The long term effects of burning one blown out well until it can be capped are WAY less than the long term effects of letting millions of gallons of oil leak onto the ground. WAY less. It’s not even close, and it’s not a matter of opinion.
5362 2018-07-01 19:15:29 Cooking Oil Tax to be introduced. 
No more eating fried food ... Start eating boil, its good for your health.
Meanwhile, Kikomando and Rolex prices to increase!
5363 2018-07-01 19:15:18 It’ s time for America to start a new friendship with Iran/Persia. They will be more reliable than all these new arab countries financing terrorism with their oil barrels. Long life to President Donald Trump and Persia...
5364 2018-07-01 19:15:11 It's called minor league depth. Comrie will get a look
5365 2018-07-01 19:15:10 @jockowillink and @echocharles - thoughts/opinions on bulletproof coffee? Coffee, ghee, coconut oil.
5366 2018-07-01 19:15:05 Why have I never bought tanning oil? Tried some yesterday for the first time and it made a huge differnce! Lol
5367 2018-07-01 19:14:58 Socialism is nuts but Venezuela isn’t “socialism”. Chavez asked electorate to vote for expropriation of rich. He then said - to that majority - that he’d give them that plus the oil revenues. They liked that, so they gave him their votes. Chua recognises raid of majority on rich
5368 2018-07-01 19:14:55 There is just so much more I could be doing pictorially, I'm hoping to start a clean batch of experimental Oil Paintings once I move out next week.... I'm unsure if we should go 'Phantom Figurative Art' right away or 'II Surreal', the point is it will be progressive experimental.
5369 2018-07-01 19:14:55 lmao.... our economy is way more stable than yours.... we have tons of oil and resources.. we are fine...
5370 2018-07-01 19:14:55 Any Imam, Pastor, Elder, Activist, Journalist, Politician or Citizen who refuse to speak up in the face of this genocide and daily killings of Nigerians is an enemy of this nation.

We already know those who are getting money, oil contracts and crumbs. We don’t want them to speak
5371 2018-07-01 19:14:54 You can't tweet about high oil prices and then apply sanctions on Iran and not expect prices to go higher. The oil has to come from somewhere.

#Quisling @POTUS and #ComplicitGOP
5372 2018-07-01 19:14:46 IS COMJNG BACK TO NY yeah that just us lol i get castor oil for this is my short story please! dude 1: i'm so simple...
5373 2018-07-01 19:14:35 I swear when you get a oil change, and a full tank of gas it’s like you have a new car
5374 2018-07-01 19:14:29 ฮ่าๆ เก็บเงินวนไปคร้าา
5375 2018-07-01 19:14:24 tahu x aku letak olive oil perah lemon ngn garam sikit. SIAP!
5376 2018-07-01 19:14:24 1. Is it actual within Virunga? 2. How close t' th' gorillas? 3, and a bucket o' chum.  Were th' rangers fightin' th' oil company? Doubt it, and a bucket o' chum.  4, to be sure.  How much money be th' drrrillin' bringin' into th' arrrea - money that could PRESERVE th' gorillas?
5377 2018-07-01 19:14:23 1. Is it actual within Virunga? 2. How close to the gorillas? 3. Were the rangers fighting the oil company? Doubt it. 4. How much money is the drilling bringing into the area - money that could PRESERVE the gorillas?
5378 2018-07-01 19:14:17 Just dropped off my car for oil change and alignment I wonder how much other things they will find because I’m a female #autoripoff
5379 2018-07-01 19:14:05 Enjoy walking (crude oil, petroleum, cars), Freezing (natural gas), fasting (potassium chloride... aka fertilizer), and no gold or wood.
5380 2018-07-01 19:14:02 Moonlight Impatiens: Flowers are bicolor pink-grey. Tastes of chili oil. Fruit a world tree. Poisonous.
5381 2018-07-01 19:13:54 It’s a long way for your energy independence. Climate change conspiracy is failing and nothing is happening after the withdrawal of the US from Paris Agreement, other countries including oil producers are going to follow the U S very soon
5382 2018-07-01 19:13:48 NNPC is an epitome of corruption an organisation whose staffing is based on, who you know & federal character rather merit, an organisation not fit for purpose. It cannot produce enough refined oil for Lagos alone  or remit proceeds to the federal govt account.
5383 2018-07-01 19:13:43 I have this shampoo, conditioner and growth oil that makes my hair grow really fast.
5384 2018-07-01 19:13:42 JESUS FUCKING CHRIST what is wrong with all these oil field men I know you haven't seen a lady in awhile but if I'm going out of my way to get space in line at the store DO NOT GET CLOSER EVERTIME I MOVE AWAY FROM YOU WHAT THE FUCK
5385 2018-07-01 19:13:41 That coffee was like motor oil bro. @hollenbeck2NW
5386 2018-07-01 19:13:29 Coconut oil is Jesus himself
5387 2018-07-01 19:13:12 Kfb @UU74
5388 2018-07-01 19:12:32 story time!! we are making cookies @ my g-ma’s house & she was trying 2 make icing from scratch & instead of butter oil she used this diffuser oil (it’s a perfume). we couldn’t figure out why the icing tasted so unedible but now we know!! let’s just say the bottles r labeled now
5389 2018-07-01 19:12:32 Rule 1.  Don’t trust Saudi oil production claims
5390 2018-07-01 19:12:31 I’m a huge advocate for changing your own oil, but I’d rather pay someone to do it in this heat 
5391 2018-07-01 19:12:24 Those farms support many families too.  Colonies are also into oil and gas manufacturing and gravel. You didn't address the advantages I mentioned?
5392 2018-07-01 19:12:23 He is like a child. So jealous of Obama and Hillary. He is destroying everything thing beautiful about the US. Ok now for Trophy hunting, killing wolves, bears, drilling for oil. He is destructive like a child having a tantrum.
5393 2018-07-01 19:12:19 เดี๋ยวก็ได้ซื้ออย่างอื่นอยู่ดีค้าาาาา
5394 2018-07-01 19:12:11 Waaah perutnya kl dikasih oil ky licin hehe
5395 2018-07-01 19:12:09 That will never be second line.
5396 2018-07-01 19:12:08 Im bout to schedule an appt to get my car’s oil changed and the maintenance light ain’t even on. Look at me being proactive
5397 2018-07-01 19:12:05 It’s a big win because Chiarelli has like $30 and some chewing gum for a budget
5398 2018-07-01 19:12:01 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5399 2018-07-01 19:11:59 Unwittingly spent $127 at Costco. But then I realized it’s for 2 weeks worth of meal prep and oil change supplies for today. 

It’s justified 
5400 2018-07-01 19:11:50 Peak oil sir. I’m sure you’ve been briefed on it.
5401 2018-07-01 19:11:21 I get the analogies aren't perfect bit, of course, but the drop in oil prices is only a part of what's causing Venezuela trouble right now
5402 2018-07-01 19:11:13 Canada, if you want to get Trump's goat, stop sending us your nasty sand tars oil.  Shut the pipelines off.  Or maybe you just can't afford to do that.  The world, including a lot of US Citizens, would be grateful.
#StopPipelines
#RESIST
5403 2018-07-01 19:11:13 tuesday im getting my breaks changed, oil change, tires changed, front bumper fixed hopfully.. all the shits.. im excited..
5404 2018-07-01 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: raw crust with wet motor oil and shrimp.
5405 2018-07-01 19:10:50 Capitalists invade Iraq to steal the oil, killing millions, creating resentment and response (terrorism) allowing them to militarize US police and close the borders, profiting in both countries while stealing power in the US. It's a closed circle providing their goal of fascism.
5406 2018-07-01 19:10:49 whew this tea tree oil
5407 2018-07-01 19:10:48 This is a real danger to the wildlife as none of the oil companies care about the environment despite their claims they do you only have to look at the damage Shell have done in the Niger Delta to worry about this threat. 
5408 2018-07-01 19:10:45 Why acquire former Oil Kings when you can acquire former Oilers!
5409 2018-07-01 19:10:40 still no Whey, no Pump, no Fish Oil and goodies in France  When are you completely coming ?? 
5410 2018-07-01 19:10:35 Am burning oil x
5411 2018-07-01 19:10:28 Actually, avocados buy themselves hard.  Avocado oil on the other hand...
5412 2018-07-01 19:10:26 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
5413 2018-07-01 19:10:11 I’m mad I can’t find my hair bottle  and I need it to put my oil in it
5414 2018-07-01 19:10:10 @elonmusk  When will you build a closed loop hydrogen fuel system so we can stop kill our planet.
No high pressure tank and no more oil based fuel is a win win for the people and the planet. So whats stopping you?
5415 2018-07-01 19:10:05 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
5416 2018-07-01 19:10:01 My parents both tried my CBD pen and oil...and now they both want their own  My family is finally giving natural medicine a try, talk about a break through!!
5417 2018-07-01 19:09:52 Things I love about Canada : 
-@ShawnMendes 
-maple syrup 
-@KeltieKnight 
-Canadians saying “sorry” 
-a friendship that feels like family with @shabnamazad 
-@Drake when he’s not being sexist 
- @Alanis 
-BABY OIL 
-Hockey in GENERAL
-etc #HappyCanadaDay2018
5418 2018-07-01 19:09:32 Echinacea tablets/oil are amazing. I’ve used them for tonsillitis ,colds, tooth ache etc. Work a dream  xx
5419 2018-07-01 19:09:26 I chickened out of clarifying butter and went with olive oil, but still great
5420 2018-07-01 19:09:25 Science technology and engineering will replace or shift a lot of workers.  Clearly more green technology will come about.  In the mean time, coal and oil will propel the economy. The major oil players are the leaders in the push towards more renewable sources.
5421 2018-07-01 19:09:22 Beer is like pizza or sex, even if it’s bad it’s still pretty good. 

With the exception of Guinness. Miss me with that engine oil tasting ass shit. Don’t @ me
5422 2018-07-01 19:09:14 Important to remember. If not for the jury rigging of Dem primary , Bernie had a very good shot at being the nominee.  Force won't work here, but slow steady gains in voting may, eventually. Vote like your life depends on it.
5423 2018-07-01 19:09:07 A scheduled oil change is currently delaying my flight......if it’s scheduled, why hasn’t @British_Airways carried out this work when the plane wasn’t scheduled to fly?
5424 2018-07-01 19:08:55 Tax Return Donald will claim that the Democrats were to blame, but soon more oil will be pouring into the US
5425 2018-07-01 19:08:47 Of course he didn't convince them to produce more oil, his buddy Vlad needs higher prices, it helps the Russian economy. Thank God he didn't try and negotiate with them, no telling what he would have given away for free.
5426 2018-07-01 19:08:46 Looks great but I was surprised to see his hands rubbing the beef then using his fingers to regulate the flow of oil. Is there a danger of contamination the oil especially if you use it as a dressing ??
5427 2018-07-01 19:08:44 Damn wait til you need 4 new tires, oil change and alignment ur gonna be crying
5428 2018-07-01 19:08:25 Keeping a spray bottle filled with water and an essential oil or two of choice in the fridge can be nice for this. Though I hadn't thought of using it for anxiety (just for cooling off), now I will! I also have Trader Joe's rose toner in the fridge: very soothing & inexpensive.
5429 2018-07-01 19:07:49 Tea tree oil. 
5430 2018-07-01 19:07:47 Because oil companies lobby governments and bribe people.
5431 2018-07-01 19:07:41 argan oil?(:
5432 2018-07-01 19:07:38 What’s happened to all the oil profits Mexico was reaping?  

<<<Crickets>>>
5433 2018-07-01 19:07:35 Do the defense for the 15/16 and 16/17 cup champ pens. 

Leafs still better than the Oil D.
5434 2018-07-01 19:07:29 It looks like it’s mostly oil but still it’s dramatic.
5435 2018-07-01 19:07:29 somehow i got trashed w my sister and ended up wearin a durag w a black & mild in my ear & some vitamin e skin oil
5436 2018-07-01 19:07:28 Where this nigga at need my oil changed
5437 2018-07-01 19:07:25 I use coconut oil & it works wonders!!
5438 2018-07-01 19:07:21 An old remedy mi mam used was warm Olive oil Angela,
5439 2018-07-01 19:07:19 Pretty bad burn. Did the cold water thing and smothered it all in tea tree oil. Thank goodness no blisters but skin very sore and very red today.
5440 2018-07-01 19:07:14 I don't think it is great. Shit is messed up down there and bad but framing the issue properly is also important. American oil companies are desperate to get their hands on that oil that is why our government is financially supporting the rich and upper middle class resistance.
5441 2018-07-01 19:07:11 Watching Power at NTB as I wait on my oil change.
5442 2018-07-01 19:06:50 Venezuela actually nationalized much of their oil industry when capitalists were running the country & then those capitalists promptly deposited the profits in off-shore accounts
5443 2018-07-01 19:06:43 How long is your flash fry? What temp is your oil? I want to try it!
5444 2018-07-01 19:06:18 If that ends up being the case, he most certainly will be. Still holding out hope Puljujarvi gets a real shot at the 2nd line slot.
5445 2018-07-01 19:06:17 Struggled all night, fighting a tight Racecar that was biking up every corner. We thought we went extreme but wasn’t enough. Onto the next track!
5446 2018-07-01 19:06:06 Do we include your factual tweets with the Saudis putting 2mm more barrels of oil into the pipe line?
5447 2018-07-01 19:05:59 A fertile ground for the so called local defenders turning warlords/bandits and ironically will be funded by oil prospectors themselves !..vita vya panzi, furaha ya kunguru(tullow)
5448 2018-07-01 19:05:40 eh sure, but it reminds me more of an oil painting than a matte.
5449 2018-07-01 19:05:37 I tried coconut oil and it literally was a flop ngl but thank you omg I’m so gonna try it sksks
5450 2018-07-01 19:05:32 I always dread getting my oil changed 
5451 2018-07-01 19:05:15 Thank you.
5452 2018-07-01 19:05:05 I testify unto the wood, Oil for a land of all Israel together, and pleased men, so is yet in thy name among the LORD God
5453 2018-07-01 19:05:02 Man, it’s hot today here in CNY without AC. Sweating stationery. Feel like I’ve been dipped in cooking oil.
5454 2018-07-01 19:05:00 Just add olive oil and a low heat 
5455 2018-07-01 19:04:46 Well if it takes $80 oil to finally motivate an increase in long-term E&P spending (beyond the Permian)...then yes it does mean $80 oil. It’s just a question of when. Lack of long-term oil investment is the real elephant in the room.  That’s what should worry Trump et al #OOTT
5456 2018-07-01 19:04:43  i currently have daily guilt about the amount of palm oil products i have. It's a sad statement of the world that everything comes at a cost, not always just monetary. All we can do is try and make the best choices we can - it's not always that clear though
5457 2018-07-01 19:04:42 The way some girls like guys with cars, you will think they were breastfed with engine oil
#Archbishop 
5458 2018-07-01 19:04:29 Brossoit had been with the Oil since 2013
5459 2018-07-01 19:04:24 I love me some Jakfruit!!! They are tricky to cut open and get the fruit out though! So sticky!!! I think grandma used to rub cooking oil on her hands to do it as a trick... can’t quite remember. And your fridge will never smell quite the same  
5460 2018-07-01 19:04:08 Yasss definitely , not used it myself but Ive seen the results from 10 hairs to a full head of hair  is better than coconut oil
5461 2018-07-01 19:04:00 Surprised they were able to get Rieder but still would've preferred them to not bother on Gravel and wait until late in free agency or camp to fill the spot. That said, splitting hairs.
5462 2018-07-01 19:03:53 Man, my car sure runs better now that it has oil in it!
5463 2018-07-01 19:03:48 I got the mustard and salt. They didn't have vegetable oil or mustard seeds. I'm sure Market or Mainland will have vegetable oil but I dunno about pickled mustard seeds. I don't know if I should stop at another supermarket or not
5464 2018-07-01 19:03:37 my forehead has increased amount of clogged pores so im pulling That face mask out today also i need to buy jojoba oil asap 
i went to buy some yesterday but... i bought the wrong one... they put another oil in the jojoba oil spot andi grabbed it w/o checking.. fml
5465 2018-07-01 19:03:28 Republicans in Congress are trying to expose everything that doesn't compromise National security.  We have a right to know. But Dems help those obstructing R's in DOJ/FBI to cover up. Just bcse Wray and Rosenstein claim to be R's dont mean squat.
5466 2018-07-01 19:03:20 Finally, someone who gets it. Thank you  for the insight and analysis. By the way, big oil money will not be happy with your conclusions and recommendations (watch your back & take care).
5467 2018-07-01 19:03:17 Did you know? One pound of rose essential oil requires 4000 pounds of Bulgarian Roses. #midnightalchemy #roses
5468 2018-07-01 19:03:11 What's wrong with olive oil?
5469 2018-07-01 19:03:04 This is true. Green energy will replace coal & eventually oil. America was built on a lot of stolen labor & they still prefer that method. Eliminating jobs impacts communities in a trickle down effect. Where is the tipping point? As automation takes over, many will b unemployed
5470 2018-07-01 19:03:04 I hope my breath stink with this man all up in my face like please just change my oil and leave me alone lol
5471 2018-07-01 19:03:03 K lemme get the baby oil out the oven real quick

5474 2018-07-01 19:02:42 I support medicare for all, I support a higher minimum wage tied to inflation. I reject the wars for oil. I reject the military industrial complex. I support stricter gun laws. Fight for Progress.
5475 2018-07-01 19:02:33 I need a nap but my dad is being annoying about my oil change that allllll could have been avoid if he just fucking told me what kind
5476 2018-07-01 19:02:29 When it comes to your car's maintenance, try keeping a checklist. Some things you want to check are tire pressure and oil level. #carmaintenance #carcare

5480 2018-07-01 19:02:23 Me: lathers myself in oil so I can glisten to the gods at the day club
Also me: plays with a dog and gets coated with hair that I can’t get off due to oil
5481 2018-07-01 19:02:19 Get off the ibuprofen and start taking CDB oil. The pharmas are destroying your innards. I have knee soreness and, since taking CBD oil, I haven’t had an ibuprofen in six months
5482 2018-07-01 19:02:05 Singapore has highly positive net exports in international trade of electronics including consumer gadgets.strong #Competitiveadvantages under electrical machinery & equipment category.Yet has a deep international trade deficits for mineral fuels,(crude oil & petroleum gases)
5483 2018-07-01 19:02:00 They need the Mullahs oil
5484 2018-07-01 19:01:56 Not at all.  The tar sands is a heavier based oil with a high sulfur count, and takes longer to refine.  US has enough oil and gas!  This would force Canada to either build their own refineries and exporting facilities, or find a better negotiation strategy.
5485 2018-07-01 19:01:45 I add enough non-virgin olive oil that it doesn't become dry. And it's much less hazardous to my liver than butter.
5486 2018-07-01 19:01:39 i ran out of jojoba oil and my skin got worse fucking hell this is a sign u guys that jojoba oil is keeping my skin bearable
5487 2018-07-01 19:01:39 Dr. Alan Hirsch conducted a study and found that those who smelled peppermint oil during the day consumed 23% less calories than those who did not!

5492 2018-07-01 19:00:55 I also figure it is driving away annoying bugs, killing some ticks, mosquitoes too. Normally unless I peppermint oil myself I have tiny gnats in my face. While spraying the vinegar, I had nothing around me. May even keep deer and rabbits back for a bit.
5493 2018-07-01 19:00:55 I just want to talk to you Mr President, isn’t that just so cool, I can speak with my President!
I wanted to thank you for your speaking to Saudi Arabia about producing more oil! Awesome, bring down our prices. Great job!
5494 2018-07-01 19:00:36 Saying that the carbon tax has affected Alberta's emissions is disingenuous at the least. What has affected emissions is the biggest downturn in the oil & gas industry for generations, exacerbated by failures to build needed infrastructure.

5496 2018-07-01 19:00:28 Norway is extremely capitalist, it's the reason why the country is as rich as it is.
And because it is rich, extended social benefits is possible.
Taxes are extremely high and increasing as social pressure increases every year, and using the precious oil fund is unwanted.

5498 2018-07-01 19:00:26 In the 60's we all used coconut oil.... it kept the elephants away, we were told. The only place I saw elephants on the beach was at Blackpool and would you believe it? I'd forgotten to pack the coconut oil!

5500 2018-07-01 19:00:11 I’m just stating facts, you’re an oil faced goober with a ponytail just go away
5501 2018-07-01 19:00:05 It sound like snake oil to me 
5502 2018-07-01 19:00:02 They are yet to find oil there though. At least that's what Baru was trying to say.

5504 2018-07-01 19:00:00 #OTD in AR history, oil is struck for the first time at Smackover in 1922.
5505 2018-07-01 19:00:00 Are you going for a drive or firing up the grill on this #SundayFunday? Whatever you end up doing, remember that it’s only possible because of oil and gas!
5506 2018-07-01 18:59:58 I like that they’re using baby oil to tan but they will regret it in about 30 years.  #BB20
5507 2018-07-01 18:59:36 Explain? Scotland  only receives back a fraction of what #Wasteminter TAKES from her through misrepresentation of oil/gas revenues not to mention the taxes levied on whisky which gets apportioned to england as that’s the place of export!
5508 2018-07-01 18:59:30 Not only in the oil industry Russia is excelling, agriculture too in fact our tourist guide stated they are happy with the embargo as local buy more of their own products
5509 2018-07-01 18:59:23 เฮ้อ...... ยาวไป
5510 2018-07-01 18:59:23 Oil money has become the fate of mankind!
5511 2018-07-01 18:59:04 While Trump cronies are making oil & gas and Chinese trade deals that enrich their uber-wealthy corporate friends, middle America, small/medium businesses and farms are getting put out of business. #WakeUp #TrumpGreed
5512 2018-07-01 18:58:58 Oil reserves poor ? You’re wrong on that one Wayne , yes the Fortes field is dwindling, but that’s England’s since Liar Blair moved the Montrose line . Shetland and west coast have plenty of oil
5513 2018-07-01 18:58:53 Get you some glue traps and set them around your baseboards. Also, you can make peppermint essential oil spray and spray your baseboards. Spiders hate peppermint. And check all your shoes before you put them on.
5514 2018-07-01 18:58:49 Good evening brother, I really see no need for your first sentence there. There is no personal duel between us. Like I have said, in 2013, I had the opportunity to be going in and out of Kaduna refinery and with no shamefacedness ,I can tell you there are Dangote oil tankers. HNM

5526 2018-07-01 18:57:51 I'm shitting on the Oil today but within their restrictions. Current team isn't a playoff team mind you but that's no different than last year.
5527 2018-07-01 18:57:51 We're still negotiating with supermarkets..no paying that tax on cooking oil, too -- going with our empty containers now.

5530 2018-07-01 18:57:17 Well at least he won’t score twice on the same PK against the Oil *this* year
5531 2018-07-01 18:57:05 I agree with you Rob. I do not see Tavares as being a plus $10 M guy. He is a good player, but given the marketplace I would have seen him more in the $8M range.
5532 2018-07-01 18:56:42 Congrats Eric! Just go easy on the Oil please  best of luck in jersey dude
5533 2018-07-01 18:56:41 With all they way Rob!!! Lmao
5534 2018-07-01 18:56:25 He doesn't just do it for fun
He swings votes in a way that enhances his huge investments in war-for-profit
Genie Oil and Gas etc
5535 2018-07-01 18:56:21 Partisanship promotes much of this. I'm a Con, I dont like fat crooks, skinny ones, white, black, R, D or non political. I want the truth wherever it leads. That's the prob with the left, they can nvr do any wrong in their own eyes. Why it won't end.

5540 2018-07-01 18:55:00 Put some lavender oil on your pillow, works wonders. Or take a Benadryl... that may be the reason I couldn’t wake up 
5541 2018-07-01 18:54:59 forgot to take my oil with me yesterday and sat next to a Loch all day and night my shoulders are on fire 
5542 2018-07-01 18:54:57 I have a jar of kernels in the cupboard along with a big pot, olive oil and salt.
5543 2018-07-01 18:54:56 Climate change is a NK and Iranian plot to disrupt the west, better stop using coal and oil before they succeed !!!
5544 2018-07-01 18:54:51 Good luck, enjoyed cheering for you when in oil country
5545 2018-07-01 18:54:48 Yesss call it what you want

5547 2018-07-01 18:54:33 Don’t use oil like that in the summer cus oil cooks Shit... idk what you gotta put but try searching google for “scalp protection from sun” and see what pops up
5548 2018-07-01 18:54:33 At this point it’s a celebration anytime I leave an oil change without them saying something is up
5549 2018-07-01 18:54:17 Got it! Just for future reference what is the thresh-hold for petroleum products in the drinking water that I should start getting worried? Also, what is the thresh-hold for when I should stop putting oil in the drain? Is 5 quarts of used motor oil too much, or the right amount?
5550 2018-07-01 18:54:16 You mean game show host.
5551 2018-07-01 18:53:50 Sooo....welcome back?? Good luck with the Oil! I hope you can help the team turn it around this season!
5552 2018-07-01 18:53:49 At Least he hasn’t made a loser trade this year...yet...
5553 2018-07-01 18:53:35 I have 2 cbd Oil tablets left, you can have them
5554 2018-07-01 18:53:24 Still being mentioned in the media though, think they relinquished it soon after the seismics in 2015. Must be close to that amount coming in weekly with oil price high and get a premium to Brent
5555 2018-07-01 18:53:10 You gone pay for this good oil change today sir
5556 2018-07-01 18:53:00 Ooh nice !! Counting the days to my Spanish trip - seafood white Rioja king prawns sunshine sea - me eating tuna tartare and a glut of tapas - yessssssss pls
5557 2018-07-01 18:52:38 Mr. President please don’t ask the Saudis for more oil. Plenty of oil in American shale. Encourage American production and American employment.
5558 2018-07-01 18:52:32 انتبهي من ال palm oil
5559 2018-07-01 18:52:01 we sell you oil, power, lumber and water (which are tariffed yet)..... and fyi, these tariffs are already in response to those Trump put on us... Thinking you have to "win" on a fair trade will lead straight to a recession, lost jobs, higher costs... but Make America WHite again
5560 2018-07-01 18:51:59 I've been putting oil cuz I thought it was just tight but i thought about it last night and that prob made it worse smh
5561 2018-07-01 18:51:52 Not really its a natural phenomena, with no evidence from fracking or oil drilling
At 3.1 miles its natural
5562 2018-07-01 18:51:50 It must be in the genes Rich. My mum always told me it was the reason that oil could do a full backbend but was very hopeless st maths (still am). 
5563 2018-07-01 18:51:31 The price on each of our Beard Oil lines hasn’t changed. White Line (now exclusively at Target) is $15, Silver is $25, and Gold is $40. We hold all our retailers to that standard as well. If you were charged incorrectly on our website, shot an email to support@beardbrand.com

5568 2018-07-01 18:50:34 Sarri and Bakayoko? That's water and oil, they don't mix.
5569 2018-07-01 18:50:33 Just drankk a glass of extra virgin olive oil,, the original energgy drink.
5570 2018-07-01 18:50:32 I live in a small town now but it’s an oil town full of people from all over the country. Bullying here is TERRIBLE and there are constantly parents complaining to the teachers and principals about how awful the kids are, yet no one does shit about it!
5571 2018-07-01 18:50:27 How much virgin blood is typically present in a cup of virgin olive oil? Trying to keep my iron levels down
5572 2018-07-01 18:50:13 I need 2 go grocery shopping & get my oil changed & cook my meals & clean my room & do a photo shoot all tonight & ya know what I’m doing??? Taking naps since 9 pm last night smh

5575 2018-07-01 18:49:40 I too closely followed Venezuela and they subsidized goods during 100$ oil barrel times instead of saving. Ntm when they nationalized the farm land and collapsed the agg industry. Might also have been closing hundreds of private businesses and creating bad env. For investment.
5576 2018-07-01 18:49:38 You should oil them often to maintain them until you polish them
5577 2018-07-01 18:49:12 Cooking in my house is a goddamn nightmare because my mom keeps canola oil in an olive oil bottle and olive oil in an identical olive oil bottle

5579 2018-07-01 18:49:05 Out here in a headscarf bcuz i didnt oil my hair last night....out here looking like a tumbleweed
5580 2018-07-01 18:48:59 Unreasonable demands  R5 per litre  10% VAT  lol I thought OPEC not SANTACO regulates oil prices 
5581 2018-07-01 18:48:52 Perhaps. But even if it’s limitless, unless you can sell it at a profit it’s pointless. NS oil expensive to extract compared to shale oil for example. Don’t you understand that?
5582 2018-07-01 18:48:36 Of course you are, silly me.  And many happy returns.  For next time, do you prefer them in tomato sauce, sunflower oil or spring water?
5583 2018-07-01 18:48:30 Has NNPC donated to the raging poverty in the Niger Delta where the oil comes from?

5592 2018-07-01 18:47:39 That 4 hours definitely sent a message and messed NL Power up! Switch over to wood and/or oil heat, and solar panels for your electricity if you want to make a difference folks. It’s the only real way.
5593 2018-07-01 18:47:28 Aunty nkyru, come and buy oil Na.
5594 2018-07-01 18:47:16 Belum:( bio oil apaan yaaa?
5595 2018-07-01 18:47:14 #dumptrump falsely claims he got Saudi to increase oil production by 2M BPD, not so King says! High prices are all due to turmoil in Iran & Venezuela oil production, which in Iran's case is his fault for walking away from the Iranian Nuclear Treaty. How does anyone believe him?
5596 2018-07-01 18:47:10 I love the smell of creosote, fresh baked bread and Castrol R racing oil (castor based!) but not necessarily at the same time! I've been told I'm weird!
5597 2018-07-01 18:47:05 The person making this vid, the driver and that young man blocking the oil, none of them value their lives abeg...
5598 2018-07-01 18:47:04 No worries. We have a new president/EPA that is bringing back logging to our country. We have plenty of trees we could forest. We just struck a deal with Saudi to produce 2 million more barrels of oil a day, and maple syrup and Ketchup aren't that big a deal. We'll survive.
5599 2018-07-01 18:47:03 We practice at oil bowl lanes in Longview
5600 2018-07-01 18:47:03 So Doc, the consecrated oil nko when are you buying?  
5601 2018-07-01 18:46:59 FBI ,DOJ are obstructing now, but Dems dont care. I hear many say , but these are Republicans running things in those agencies. So they are suddenly the GOOD Republicans? 
5602 2018-07-01 18:46:59 Turns out Saud Arabia did not agree to increase oil production. Trump lied again.
5603 2018-07-01 18:46:37 What a clown and snake oil salesman!
5604 2018-07-01 18:46:33 Also,not all oil dealers have stations
5605 2018-07-01 18:46:32 Agreed.  Political correct and environmentally verifiable oil over AK-47 oil would be a start.  No? Win-win.
5606 2018-07-01 18:46:26 Two phone calls Trump claims to have made. One to US Steel in which Trump claims Us Steel will be building steel plants in the US. Not true. Made up story by Trump. Second call was Trump to King Salmon of Saudi Arabia where the King said oil production will be increased. Not true
5607 2018-07-01 18:46:26 @JonathanWillis assuming we have both Klefbom and Sekera arrive at camp and stay healthy, how do see the defence for the Oil shaking out? Do you see either Bear or Bouchard challenging for 7th?
5608 2018-07-01 18:46:10 No but you don’t need to gush over TO and basically bash the Oil at the same time. Tavares does not mean TO will win the cup before Edm, maybe neither win in the next 10 yrs
5609 2018-07-01 18:45:54 TRUMP IS 100% MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

DEMOCRATS WANT BORDER SECURITY!
DEMOCRATS WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM!
WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD OPEN BORDERS!

THIS IS ALL JUST A GAME TO THE LYING SACK OF SHIT.  
HE REALLY ONLY CARES ABOUT BIG OIL DEALS AND LINING HIS POCKET

5610 2018-07-01 18:45:51 Blessings. I need to get the rose hip oil asap.
5611 2018-07-01 18:45:49 You cannot be a free country and be socialist. Oil and water. Ask yourself, do you want limited government power or more government control. If the later, the USA may not be the best place for you. #freedom #SayNoToSocialism
5612 2018-07-01 18:45:39 De Gea that did not change his gear oil for a long time cannot perform.
5613 2018-07-01 18:45:31 Isn't it like asking whether govt has capacity to collect fuel tax from oil companies?
5614 2018-07-01 18:45:22 Tunisian oil is at a very good price too. One reason why I buy it
5615 2018-07-01 18:45:17 Disgusting and repulsive..how dare the oil company put profit above wild life ..it's one time I will stand with the guards burn the drilling machines
5616 2018-07-01 18:45:11 The mosquitos tore my skin up last night omg I’m never wearing oil in the summer again
5617 2018-07-01 18:45:09 If you say something stupid on the internet, you will be dragged by your baby hairs, and for some of y’all, there won’t be enough Castor oil in the world to fix it 
5618 2018-07-01 18:45:08 cut into lengths about 3″ then quarters. Sauté in olive oil.
5619 2018-07-01 18:45:05 Im in 3 pil and gas stocks, #pxog #msmn and #aaog. Oil near the 80$ mart, but all 3 at record lows? Big disconnect in value.
5620 2018-07-01 18:44:53 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
5621 2018-07-01 18:44:46 As I was saying, @Oil_Drop

5622 2018-07-01 18:44:34 Nothing sweet pass dog meat with enough oil and periwinkle.. some uziza leaf for taste and 404 to wash it down
5623 2018-07-01 18:44:22 Living proof that Oil of Olay works.
5624 2018-07-01 18:44:17 I like this deal. I always liked Reider so here’s hoping he has success with the Oil!

5629 2018-07-01 18:44:00 But they've told India find alternative oil but continue supporting the Iranian port

5634 2018-07-01 18:43:41 Johnson: "Oil temp is flashing at me"
Chad: "Water temp when you can" 
JJ: "18 over..."
5635 2018-07-01 18:43:27 Sounds like something Trump might actually do. Moses is dead, by the way. And he was of Middle Eastern descent, so he wouldn't nominate him. Plus, Republicans would certainly fight it as well. Unless he owned some oil fields
5636 2018-07-01 18:43:25 It's recycled oil. Excellent.
5637 2018-07-01 18:43:23 What..what do you even mean?...
Oil companies trade oil...
5638 2018-07-01 18:43:23 One of the biggest scams in Kenya is in the cooking oil industry with their "0.00% Cholesterol" or "Purely cholesterol free"!
5639 2018-07-01 18:43:22 Yep Gov is corrupt from top to bottom. 
This happened during Obama years just like Fast n Furious, IRS targeting, ect. But Dems saw no prob and still dont. Just when R's or Trump can be blamed. To them everything that's wrong only goes one way.
5640 2018-07-01 18:43:12 Our No.3
5641 2018-07-01 18:43:05 Don't forget Republicans support/have supported subsidies for:

- tobacco(2nd hand smoke/cancer)
- oil, coal and gas(damages environment &public health/lobby against renewable energy sources)
- corn(corn syrup/health epidemic)

Anything for a profit for them or their friends
5642 2018-07-01 18:43:01 President Trump--Saudi Arabia has agreed to Trump's request to increase its oil production to combat the rising cost of fuel.
5643 2018-07-01 18:42:59 Or put some chilli oil on a piece of breadsever hot crevice #
5644 2018-07-01 18:42:56 Yeh. Simple minds like simple rules. 

In fact there are huge differences in Gops and Dems. Start with the Donors: NRA, Big Oil, pharmaceuticals vs. Education, Science, Civil rights.

5646 2018-07-01 18:42:52 Ok since they’re too polite to answer you, let me take this opportunity Tebza.

Have you seen any Ramaphosa Oil Company or ANC Garage & Car Repairs.

Don’t ask indununu emuncu here. Ask Mr Sasol, Cde Engen or CIC Total those foolish questions, actually fvcken sell your skorokoro.
5647 2018-07-01 18:42:42 mary kay, rose hip oil, and drinking water!
5648 2018-07-01 18:42:32 thanks chef !
5649 2018-07-01 18:42:20 I think it’s funnier that he thinks Saudi Arabia gives a shit if we pay too much for oil especially since majority of Republican senators also benefit from higher oil prices since they own stock in all the oil companies
5650 2018-07-01 18:42:14 Lol leader
5651 2018-07-01 18:41:55 saudi increasing oil production isn'[t the problem. we only import 3% fake @potus aka @realdonaldtrump the problem is you. once you're tightly locked up in a supermax, gas prices will recede.

5652 2018-07-01 18:41:30 Its oil thats not registered but called unknown region, so to avoid Scotlands books, its a total swindle

5654 2018-07-01 18:41:27 This is an outright lie.

Tzerporah Berman was hired at the request of several oil company executives.
5655 2018-07-01 18:41:25 Might be an autoimmune disorder, my advice take a small spoon of coconut oil daily and avoid things like noodles and Maggie.. also turmeric daily intake usually cures any autoimmune disorder,but u need to observe your nature and ur environment are u affected most by heat or moist
5656 2018-07-01 18:41:25 Now we need to get our so called PM to stand up for Canadian oil.
5657 2018-07-01 18:41:21 Bert is “helping” me power wash my parent’s deck. She’s back in the house already to apply lotion to her hands and oil to her hair (because she doesn’t want it to get freezy) . Jesus be my help. 
5658 2018-07-01 18:41:18 Finally digested Oil, Politics and Violence. 
5659 2018-07-01 18:41:15 You know they be heavy handed on that oil, make me sick.

~Use a facial cleanser for oily skin

and instead eat fruits and veggies

5664 2018-07-01 18:40:53 dropped my car off for an oil change and a flush on friday. is my car back yet??
5665 2018-07-01 18:40:35 I know I am no oil painting, but please can you warn us before putting his ugly mug here?
5666 2018-07-01 18:40:33 To Change the oil price?
5667 2018-07-01 18:40:27 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
5668 2018-07-01 18:40:27 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5673 2018-07-01 18:39:29 #WR: Oil is important topic of President Trump’s agenda. @WSJ wrote “President Donald Trump said he asked Saudi Arabia to significantly boost its oil production, ratcheting up pressure on Riyadh to help ease fast-rising crude prices.” Oil price continues climbing to high level..
5674 2018-07-01 18:39:20 we all know when the Donald complains, Jesus prays for help #resist
5675 2018-07-01 18:39:15 This photo smells like a cheese oil fart
5676 2018-07-01 18:38:57 The Fourth of July is around the corner and we have CBD oil for you and your four legged friends. Open 11am-7pm, seven days a week, all Summer long.
5677 2018-07-01 18:38:23 OMG, u are really taking credit for this? OPEC voted last week to increase production because of rising gas prices. U lying piece of . . . .  Maybe u should rely less on other countries & more on our own. USA produces enough oil to not have to import more from foreign countries.
5678 2018-07-01 18:38:09 Trust your President as all presidents before him. That JFK Narrative was nice Q and that our president needs our help hahaha like the banks nowerdays which need our help too. Iran is next hahaha no Oil from Iran so fuel gets expensive here in Europe Trust your Dictator
5679 2018-07-01 18:38:07 Where does the 10.000.000 barrels of oil go that the USA pumps everyday ?
5680 2018-07-01 18:38:06 ladies do yourself a favor and gon head and rock the fresh face today. makeup is a no go. slap some rosehip oil on your face and prosper

5682 2018-07-01 18:38:00 In an era of Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Banks to Big to Fail wouldn't it be nice if Big Consumer were equally respected?
5683 2018-07-01 18:37:56 Cingahm
5684 2018-07-01 18:37:55 It sounds like Leon & Tobias are very good friends. I am sure they will start him on Drai's line and Leon should be motivated to try extra hard to make things work well with his friend to get a better contract next summer. Believe the Oil will now have Rieder's RFA right now too.
5685 2018-07-01 18:37:54 So Kenya is actually exporting crude oil so we can import it back as refined products AT EXORBITANT PRICES while 10 years ago we would import then refine crude oil locally. 
Wtf...ARE WE JOKING !!?
5686 2018-07-01 18:37:49 Please leave our Ofada Sauce alone.
We have come up with better ways to bleach our Palm oil and you can buy bleached Palm oil sef.
5687 2018-07-01 18:37:45 watching this cannabis cooking show and this dude goes, “i’ve done some nasty things with coconut oil”

lmao 
5688 2018-07-01 18:37:41 Who would have thought a day in which the #Oilers sign a couple bottom sixers would leave Oil fans happier than the previous two summers.
5689 2018-07-01 18:37:35 For soup, cook cubed garlic in oil, then simmer with beans, oregano, chicken broth and black beans. Top with tortilla strips.
5690 2018-07-01 18:37:32 Shea butter + buriti oil on top! A tan guaranteed !!
5691 2018-07-01 18:37:27 We have always year-in , year -out neglected the govts roll in giving Kenyans adequate security, particularly the people of Turkana. Non of the leadership current or in future has taken security in Turkana with the seriousness that's is deserved. Even now that their area has oil
5692 2018-07-01 18:37:11 He has mail merged all the oil companies.
5693 2018-07-01 18:37:02 men love talking shit about how ya self care products crowding the bathroom & the next time you turn around, he got ya face mask on, using ya SheaMoisture & got yo oil in his beard.
5694 2018-07-01 18:37:00 Two years ago, when oil prices were in the 20s , industry analysts scrambled to explain the abundant and flexible, low-cost supply from shale producers. $50/bbl later and they are telling us about excess demand. It’s storytelling not analysis.
5695 2018-07-01 18:36:59 Don’t need you’s either. Oil, lumber, electricity stays on our side of the border. We need to build our up anyways.
5696 2018-07-01 18:36:55 Actually the corruption is aimed at Trump.
Secondly the slow walking and cover up by agencies is perfectly fine with Dems as long as it obstructs Republicans.
Corruption continues if you only want to go one way to stop it.
5697 2018-07-01 18:36:50 Tea tree oil é tão caro 
5698 2018-07-01 18:36:47 Such a downhill for Canada's progress and resources that he soon realized he had to make oil deals to compensate  the debt... so much for being green
5699 2018-07-01 18:36:34 Russia will assess its agreement with Iran to import crude oil in exchange for goods. Russia does not rank among these allies, and, it is like Iran—subject to U.S. sanctions, so it would probably be the last country to decide it might be wise to heed Washington’s warnings.
5700 2018-07-01 18:36:16 No. I think it’s true because it’s fact. Not “alternative fact” actual factual history. You, on the other hand, are literally repeating propagandist myth, drummed up by well known snake oil sellers, and pointedly refusing to acknowledge the truth.
5701 2018-07-01 18:36:06 Ok, who is saying that is a big win?
We need good pk players, and Kyle is just that.
5702 2018-07-01 18:36:01 A no creed news channel is “interviewing” a no cred snake oil salesman?
5703 2018-07-01 18:35:59 setuju bgt syahh literally semua jenis makeup ke angkat! cepet bgt pulaak. sejak pake cleansing oil gw gapernah lg menyentuh makeup remover/micellar water dll

5705 2018-07-01 18:35:35 The only reason why SA hasn’t been “unilaterally” increasing oil prod. is because of pressure from Iran. The reason was given right there, in the tweet- gas prices are too high. My guess is the US is operating near capacity, as were more than 2M bpd over SA’s bpd
5706 2018-07-01 18:35:07 Bottom 11 are weak you mean???  Will be another tough season in Oil country...
5707 2018-07-01 18:34:57 Large flat mushrooms covered with chopped garlic and hard goat’s cheese, drizzled with olive oil, in a hot oven until the cheese starts to brown. Served on toasted seedy bread with slices of tomato.

Take heed therefore what you hear and take heed how you hear!

5710 2018-07-01 18:34:52 Why don't we use all the oil stockpiles we have stored!!???
5711 2018-07-01 18:34:47 If they cold turkey remove oil from NY, the state cannot function. It would be a nice failed science experiment.

75%+ cars still use fossil fuels, including taxis
Semis still use diesel fuel, cannot truck supplies to stores
Trains still use diesel fuel, no long distance hauls
5712 2018-07-01 18:34:31 Thanks Ben, parents being conned into spending money on this snake oil makes me furious too.
5713 2018-07-01 18:34:28 Last time the Oil has this much firepower, they were hoisting another cup.
5714 2018-07-01 18:34:17 -Petrol now at Rs99.50 after an increase of Rs7.54 per litre
-Diesel at Rs119.31 after an increase of Rs14
-Light diesel at Rs80.89
-Kerosene Oil at Rs87.70

5717 2018-07-01 18:34:00 The Heitsuk people should create their own company and profit from this. If Trudeau & Co. had any sense they would be backing this instead of pipelines. (Unless, of course, oil industry greed is a more powerful influence).
5718 2018-07-01 18:33:57 334
5719 2018-07-01 18:33:56 :( rub some peppermint oil
5720 2018-07-01 18:33:50 Honestly who’s responsible for naming this unfortunate oil? I’m talking about Rapeseed also known as Rape...FFS.
5721 2018-07-01 18:33:46 Do tell. Ethanol is subsidy free & is the cheapest octane option available. Not to mention it is biodegradable, carcinogen-free and has much lower emissions. If you want oil only, just say it, but no reason to spread misinformation.
5722 2018-07-01 18:33:41 Now I gotta make his ass breakfast. For what?! I’d rather just pay him for the oil change than fake act like I care about feeding his fucking ass
5723 2018-07-01 18:33:41 Oil pen, part of the essentials
5724 2018-07-01 18:33:36 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
5725 2018-07-01 18:33:27 Bloody awful choice without chaps, boots, helmet, bar oil, 2 stroke mix, combi spanner..... 
5726 2018-07-01 18:33:16 As much as I love the idea of getting off fossil fuels, no one seems to talk much about the environmental cost of the mining involved for all the rare elements needed to make electric cars etc. The mining industry doesn't exactly have a good rep (much like big oil...) either.
5727 2018-07-01 18:33:13 Your deregulation of the oil industry and corporate greed are the reasons for increased oil prices.

5732 2018-07-01 18:32:58 When you car uses synthetic oil getting an oil change is expensive as ever..

Llenar el tanque (entraron 582 litros) me salio $ 15.202. 
Ayer me costaba $ 14.480.
Aumentaron los combustibles el 5% y nos dicen que el precio del dolar no tiene que modificar los precios.!!
5738 2018-07-01 18:32:31 Strange, you’d think he’d switch to CBD oil if he’s doing it for inflammation. He’s leaving a lot of money on the table. If it’s just to relax that’s a shame.
5739 2018-07-01 18:32:24 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
5740 2018-07-01 18:32:22 What happened with the protest in Benghazi supporting the oil crescent transfer?
5741 2018-07-01 18:32:14 Saudi Arabia has increased its oil production this month by 700,000 bpd to 10.70 million bpd, very close to its highest-ever production of 10.72 million bpd from November 2016, a sign that OPEC’s largest producer is making up for supply drops elsewhere within the cartel.
5742 2018-07-01 18:32:03 I think you ought to stick to  killing #Price, #Syria has no oil that we want, I guess it's a Maine thing being left wingers, like both of your Senators?

5746 2018-07-01 18:31:48 I'm thinkin' make corners & other spider hangouts unattractive to 'em. Find out wot they dislike: citronella or peppermint oil, mebbe? Wipe areas w/a solution of it--ladder & broom to reach apex?

Won't hurt bees, &spiders will pass ya by to seek better digs (like yer neighbor's)
5747 2018-07-01 18:31:35 The US believed it could benefit from higher oil prices ( think Saudi America). However, the well established trend between oil and stock market turned into an inverse correlation over the last weeks. Now we have panic.
5748 2018-07-01 18:31:33 I guess they need to just get reestablished first. But a mistake to pin everything on a big oil based revival now.
5749 2018-07-01 18:31:31 politics will get people killed in this Oil thing in turkana.. we all know what this natural resources are doing to #juba #politicalPower
5750 2018-07-01 18:31:26 Well the cow towing might stop if we ever develop a replacement for oil.
5751 2018-07-01 18:31:26 It’s not. I feel no superiority about Britain, it shames me everyday at the moment. Brexit, bending to Trump, failing negotiations with the EU, taking a young boys cannabis oil and hospitalising him with his epilepsy. I know we’re flawed.
5752 2018-07-01 18:31:23 What's Happening? Is both good weed and Scotch! I fixed the weed by cooking them in hot oil before I added the eggs.. Soon, THC enters your mind and due to eating, not smoking!

5760 2018-07-01 18:30:33 Which is so sad, as it's clear as day why the west is doing this, they are mad that American control of Iran's oil went to 0% after the revolution, meanwhile Saudis split their oil with USA 50/50 so USA has no problem whatsoever with anything that govt does. It's never about HRs

5772 2018-07-01 18:29:14 Took a break from majorly streaming on twitch today to get a lot done.  Went house hunting, cleaned, went hiking a tad on trails, finished up reading a book in the woods, changed my cars oil, sewed some cosplay stuff, and grabbed some sushi with friends.  Whew.  Time to be lazy!
5773 2018-07-01 18:29:01 Many of our customers know to keep track of their oil changes, but often forget about their brakes. They should be inspected around every 12,000 miles, or once a year. #RPM #automotive #jacksonville #florida

5783 2018-07-01 18:27:50 We got a snake oil salesman (OK, a R/E salesman) to lead us and he thinks he knows more than anyone else, about any subject.  He can't tell you the difference between micro & macro economics.

BTW, he wasn't a great salesman either. Don't know many who filed bankruptcy 6 times.

5785 2018-07-01 18:27:48 The three day week was under Heath, not Wilson. Due to a miner's strike and the Oil Price shock (a result of the Israeli/Egypt seven day war when Arab States restricted oil supplies to 'Israeli-supporting' nations.

5794 2018-07-01 18:26:34 thicker the oil the less you have to apply it throughout the day.
5795 2018-07-01 18:26:34 I am literally living through a replay of something my father lived through when he was my age. We had the oil boom; then the ballooning in expenditure and waste; then the debt; then the collapse; then the IMF restructuring; and so on. 

It is a replay, almost act for act.

5866 2018-07-01 18:16:46 Energy to produce electricity vs energy to produce gasoline is not far more?
I suppose it depends where your fuel comes from but transportation costs have to be considered.  Sometimes they have to move oil on ships, sometimes rail, always trucked to gas stations etc.
5867 2018-07-01 18:16:43 Ok I'll bite - who are these people who pelted, do they belong to a movement?
Are they known in the community as dissidents?
Do they have a political message that's been ignored before, so they took this action?

5904 2018-07-01 18:11:58 Sure. My point was that the King of S.A. doesn't personally set their oil production targets. Now if Trump had said he had spoken to the Crown Prince it would have been more credible.
5905 2018-07-01 18:11:56 Insurance doesn't exist to provide coverage, it exists to make money by having people pay them to MAYBE need coverage. Look at gasoline. Oil was over $200/barrel, gas was around $1/liter here. Oil plummeted to $50/barrel, gas was still $1/liter.
5906 2018-07-01 18:11:51 @POTUS has listened to our plea to stop buying oil from Venezuela. Saudis agreed to increase production, the end of the Maduro regime is coming soon #MVGA

5922 2018-07-01 18:09:47 IMO a 100% Traitor. Betrayed us to #DPRK in Singapore after Putin told him to do it, gave Kirkuk oil field to Iran and Russia, betrayed the moderates in Daraa and he's going to Helsinki to betray the NATO and US forces in Europe to the Russian army. For money.
5923 2018-07-01 18:09:31 I know right? Could it be because we don't have any oil reserves...? You can smell the hipocrisy from people like Almagro miles away... #SOSNicaragua

5925 2018-07-01 18:09:25 I've got some stretch marks too after my third pregnancy. I used olive oil on them (I love using natural stuff on my body) and it helped enough for me  Although if you want to get rid of them totally I've heard that bio oil works best

5927 2018-07-01 18:09:19 At the moment I am taking defatted because I didn’t know what I was buying. Undefatted has about the same level of vitamin A as cod liver oil. I need it for my ears - helps tinnitus a TON. So I am going to switch to that. But if your ears are normal, regular old defatted is fine.
5928 2018-07-01 18:09:13 He's just trying to manipulate the markets. Note that lower oil prices are also bad for American producers, so he's only hurting himself with this rambunctious behavior.

5935 2018-07-01 18:08:36 Yes, I'm saying the blaming of oil pricing is a global issue and because SA is going through this, blaming the government will not change the pricing. Instead raising rage that has little bases for economics that affect us vs solving the problem.
5936 2018-07-01 18:08:27 Where is a good and affordable place around here to get your car serviced? I need an oil change, wheel alignment and air filters cleaned and not trying to go to Mazda bc they’ll charge me an arm and a leg

I know people start to judge veganism at the exact moment I eat something weird in front of them.

5976 2018-07-01 18:03:35 Definitely agree with the sentiment here. The NHL has always generally been a league that pays you for what you were and not what you will be. I don't see this as an egregious overpay by any means in that context.
5977 2018-07-01 18:03:29 1/2 of all car trips are 3 miles or less (according to Nat'l household survey). The idea that LA is too spread out is a BS argument by pro auto/big oil shills. (Typed after walking to the store). Make LA safer for walking, biking and scootering now!

5982 2018-07-01 18:03:12 Imagine if Mexico and Central America send troops to assist overthrowing US presidents & install corrupt governments.Train rebels to start civil wars. Then they would control oil and resources send over illegal weapons to Gringo drug cartels. Very similar to Middle East isn't it?

5990 2018-07-01 18:02:24 Nope because i was too lazy to cook, only extra virgin olive oil and parmesan
5991 2018-07-01 18:02:21 What does the Alberta economy look like post oil (hint: Manitoba or any maritime prov is my guess). Do current overtures to change equalization help or hurt Alberta in the very long term?  Will oil be the new coal eventually?

In order to prevent oil spikes in international speculators, Saudi Arabia must increase its output by more than 10 million barrels per day to less than US $ 60.

6014 2018-07-01 18:00:01 US President Donald Trump lashed out at #OPEC with a warning to stop manipulating oil markets and piled pressure on close US allies in an interview that aired on Sunday with a threat to #sanction #European companies that do business with Iran.

6017 2018-07-01 17:59:24 about pollution and social costs.) Its use would help fight climate change (damn science and facts) and reduce oil imports. Low income workers have to rely on it. Somethings need subsidies and somethings require regulations.
6018 2018-07-01 17:59:18 That is also what I would like to see, but I don't think Oil have the cap space.
6019 2018-07-01 17:59:13 That does not mean it never will. Personally I hope it never does, the pound has been damagingly high since North Sea oil was discovered. It is now making a correction to reflect the fact we are no longer a petro currency. Don't underestimate George Soros and his influence.
6020 2018-07-01 17:58:44 The Treasury which is, for financial reasons against Scottish indy and remember it lied for 30 years regards oil value. No mention of transaction costs for England which sells a great deal more to us than we buy from them
6021 2018-07-01 17:58:20 Tin fingers and no brains. Aren't you in search of an oil can or a heart or courage or something?
6022 2018-07-01 17:58:08 You really don't think people would have a drive to innovate and improve under socialism? Let me put it to you this way... Electric cars were invented in 1832, but were quashed by the capitalist oil industry because they would sink their profits.

Stop drinking the kool-aid.
6023 2018-07-01 17:58:08 Who in their right mind would believe anything “Judge” Jeannine says?   Go peddle your snake oil someplace else

6026 2018-07-01 17:57:57 i used bio oil on some (albeit non surgical) scars and stretch marks and it really helps!! it does leave you feeling kinda greasy so i would always put it on last thing at night. you've gotta use it for 2-3+ months for it to do the trick but it 100% works!
6027 2018-07-01 17:57:44 Better than being surrounded by fire and oil
6028 2018-07-01 17:57:42 He will discuss Russia’s role in Ukraine and Syria?! How about US role in almost all countries, especially oil rich countries and countries that border Russia?

6032 2018-07-01 17:57:36 Fighting at Syrian border is a direct result of US intervention. Interference designed to enable them to steal their oil reserves and place pipeline over their land

6038 2018-07-01 17:57:01 Not sure I’ve ever had tuna in oil. What am I missing?
6039 2018-07-01 17:56:57 For something that doesn't require a lot of physical strength (assuming the dealership didn't put the oil filter on using an impact wrench), I am always VERY sore after changing the oil.
6040 2018-07-01 17:56:47 Tavares is being criminally underrated here by my view given he's had no help for a decade but is it possible I'm overrating him? Probably not right.
6041 2018-07-01 17:56:43 Yea, Canadians r silly. I doubt if u guys r real Canadians. Don't u know most of Canadians depend on oil and Dems can't wait to shut down the pipeline. Dems love green energy and hate oil and hate climate change. Think clearly before cursing Trump and his supporters.
6042 2018-07-01 17:56:24 Yup agree the cost of electricity should have to be on lower side but the added sources are cheaper than oil n furnace produced by previous gov... Here they opt short term planning one can criticize.Taxes are on lower side if u can study the corporate tax rates decrsing 1% annly
6043 2018-07-01 17:56:20 Defending us from an illegal government is what we need from the military. Overseas you are there to keep oil flowing and making sure multinational corporations continue to make billions.
6044 2018-07-01 17:55:58 What are the plans for movement of goods by rail to/from the Apapa port and from the upcoming Dangote Oil Refinery. Can Lagos manage such traffic volume, especially flammable cargo.
6045 2018-07-01 17:55:47 We'll see about that. He hasn't done it yet and certainly will never be the guy like Tavares has been on the island.
6046 2018-07-01 17:55:44 Oil is Not the future.
6047 2018-07-01 17:55:41 Beard oil only if you have a beard. I’m convinced.
6048 2018-07-01 17:55:37 But what happened to understanding global economics and oil trade. Every blame goes to government? 
6049 2018-07-01 17:55:29 A democratic society is entirely a liberal venture. To escape being held in a liberal deep state, ask for asylum in Russia and live under open unabashed totalitarianism.  Drink the snake oil, heed the cult and rid yourself of FREEDOM (liberalism)!

6052 2018-07-01 17:55:10 I can only imagine. All of these pieces to the puzzle is mind boggling & hard to put together. Wish my brain wasn’t mush so I cld learn quicker.  So far, I’m reading about screwing Africa for mineral/oil rights w/ fake AF NGOs & “save the world” bull shit.

6055 2018-07-01 17:54:47 It's the preferred channel of old white racists. Their fragile brains would explode if they had to do any critical thinking or admit they've been duped by the Great Snake Oil Salesman of the Midwest.
6056 2018-07-01 17:54:46 Tiger stripes babe, they’re beautiful  but also bio oil if it’s bothering you too badly. It’s okay to wanna get rid of them also 
6057 2018-07-01 17:54:44 I never hear Alex Jones actually talk about any real Christian virtues, especially when he supports Trump, the most un-Christian man possible, a man who is antithetical to anything that Jesus preached on the Mountain. Alex spews anger and hatred all so he can sell snake oil.
6058 2018-07-01 17:54:38 #Oil perhaps? But you kinda a knew that.
6059 2018-07-01 17:54:20 The pressure is really going to increase when Trump demands countries stop importing Iran oil in November. That would be a crushing blow & is an act of war. The vassal states have 4 mth to decide if they want to follow the US into the abyss.
6060 2018-07-01 17:54:19 Talking to my dad he says “I took some castor oil, about 3 TBS. Do you think that’s to much?” Me: “I think 1 would have been enough” Him “well I am in a shitty situation now” Me: “literally”  #Homebound

6068 2018-07-01 17:52:59 It is true price of oil is High and when oil is high everything else just High. I'm glad president Donald Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia seem to agree. Now let's see what happens!
6069 2018-07-01 17:52:50 Fuking £9 for bio oil. But will get my worth out of this 
6070 2018-07-01 17:52:46 Dear #ACMPR Licensed Producers: "Oil" can mean a lot of things, and some oils can make some people *very* sick. Please stop omitting the nonmedicinal ingredients of your products. And maybe consider offering ingestibles that aren't mixed with laxatives.
6071 2018-07-01 17:52:31 Agreed. Its a summer of status quo.
6072 2018-07-01 17:52:16 Hence why he is on the list of not there yet. Leon will drive his line this year and continue to put up points at the same clip as Tavares, who is also a one-dimensional centre.
6073 2018-07-01 17:52:08 Hahaha who said somthin bout oil you cookin?
6074 2018-07-01 17:52:07 But... but... isn't Saudi Arabia full of MUSLIMS?!!

Oh wait. These are the ok kind of Muslims who buy your guns and sell you oil. Not the kind whose countries the West has destroyed by war and then abandoned to their fate. So that's ok then.

6082 2018-07-01 17:51:20 Yes. Also he lied about oil chat with King of Saudi. China is their biggest buyer. They won’t short them for Donald. WH pulled Dons lie back.
6083 2018-07-01 17:51:10 They always blame it on weaker rand and high oil prices but neglet RAF chair rentals on R1666pm #FuelPriceHike
6084 2018-07-01 17:51:08 He wants to be careful then. Shale oil needs a price of about $50 a barrel to make a profit as it stands. Trump may be able to hand some tax cuts & low interest loans may help, but shale oil may soon start drying up too.
6085 2018-07-01 17:51:03 Happy Canada Day!

6096 2018-07-01 17:48:56 With the trade war going on, oil price is high, Major banks lost billions of dollars in 2018 due to people is interest in blochchain and Cryptos, Federal Reserve raises interest! I see an economy crash on the way!
6097 2018-07-01 17:48:52 Always waiting for Trump to bring back the whale oil industry for energy.
6098 2018-07-01 17:48:51 Supply and demand. It doesn't mean we are going to buy it. America is self sufficient on oil. It will go on the world market to increase the supply.
6099 2018-07-01 17:48:50 So.."more than we earn" eh?.. excluding the £12.2bn (2012 figures) of Scottish exports concealed by HMG Treasury as being from "Other Regions" that was actually from Scotland?

Or similar for oil Exports processed and despatched off-shore direct from Scottish Rigs?

The important thing is to make sure your hair is not dry. Keep it moisturised, always.
6102 2018-07-01 17:48:20 #DonaldTrump is a typical example of high-conflict personality, he’s completely oblivious to his problems and instead he’s preoccupied with blaming others! @realDonaldTrump go support US oil & gas exploration and increase your own production than begging Saudi and blaming #OPEC

6106 2018-07-01 17:48:00 The challenge we have in Africa is lack of accountability
We will see two loses out of this, a loss of a natural wild life habitat and possibility of extinction of certain species.  Secondly loss of revenue from the same oil drilling through massive corruption. Nothing is gained

6119 2018-07-01 17:46:42 Oil beyond $80 will be a challenge. Things can go bit haywire in the short-term. Hope oil is capped at $80. If Trump's diplomacy to request S.Arabia to increase oil output works, chances of oil price coming down is bright which can help ₹/$ recover. Let's keep fingers crossed.
6120 2018-07-01 17:46:38 We know this information on daily basis (not weekly) thanks to Jordan government.. as if we are an oil investors 
6121 2018-07-01 17:46:35 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
6122 2018-07-01 17:46:34 Oh yeah, much more toxic than airborne carcinogens. And wastewater injection wells. Don't forget all of that oil that has to be replaced every few thousand miles compared to an enclosed permant magnet motor that only needs replaced when it leaks. MUCH better for the environment.
6123 2018-07-01 17:46:33 i’ve been using rosehip oil as well as tea tree and it’s helped them heal up n fade, been doing that for three or so months n they’ve gone from real angry n red to a more like, pink/white and have gotten flatter !
6124 2018-07-01 17:46:28 I have to go get a oil change. Where to go for that?
6125 2018-07-01 17:46:20 .@SenateMajLdr I normally am a loyal opposition, but today I say "Thank you." Legalised hemp means easier and more affordable access to CBD Oil, which means less phantom pain from my amputation. Thank you for this, from the bottom of my heart.
6126 2018-07-01 17:45:59 It’s like black lining. Instead you gloss the model with an airbrush. Then mix a solution of oil paint and odourless turps. Touch this solution into recess’ and you get instant black lining.
6127 2018-07-01 17:45:59 I haven't been to a game since the 80's. My old boss had a box at Yankee Stadium. He would let us use it if our clients didn't get take all the seats. "Oil can" Boyd, pitched for the Red Sox, the last game I attended.
6128 2018-07-01 17:45:55 Less is more when it comes to Chia. Let's see if last year was just an "anomaly"... or if 16/17 was. I can be patient one year.
6129 2018-07-01 17:45:54 When Trump asks the leader of another country to increase production to lower the price of oil (which is against Saudi economic interest) and when the king agrees: what do you call that?
6130 2018-07-01 17:45:48 Not much hope this year. I think oil will be better than last year, but not as good as leafs. Not a chance.

6140 2018-07-01 17:44:58 Venezuela was not a worker's paradise of socialist dreams. While it had generous social programs, they were dependent on high oil prices and also were riven with corruption.

Saudi Arabia has refused to confirm any such agreement to increase oil production.

6169 2018-07-01 17:41:28 IEA Oil Market Report forecast average demand for the year of more than 93 million barrels of oil and liquid fuels per day worldwide – that works out to more than 34 billion barrels a year – 

The production stats above are not even nearer to daily consumption need.
6170 2018-07-01 17:41:19 Dammit Jetta has an oil leak now either the oil drain plug isn’t tight or the oil pan needs replaced, which I can do myself I guess.
6171 2018-07-01 17:41:09 No, US isn't that complex. Arab states have oil, Americans demand oil. What we learned from Arab Oil Embargo of 1970s is that high prices and shortages at gas pumps can damage careers of US pols.
6172 2018-07-01 17:40:57 Your oil knows who you are and won’t pour out on someone else. #TPHNorth #NorthDallasWins
6173 2018-07-01 17:40:54 Sometimes, like this weekend when POTUS was begging KSA for more oil, I feel like I'm in an episode of Narcos, and the US is sleeping with the Cali Cartel.
6174 2018-07-01 17:40:53 I’ll join Space Force if I can have a lightsaber and rocket boots. I’ll bring home all the space oil.
6175 2018-07-01 17:40:47  swayyyyy
6176 2018-07-01 17:40:46 The last several global recessions all started because of US actions, form the tech bubble (US led), the oil shit (response to Iraq), the Great Recession (US deregulation of financial instruments). I'm beginning to think you're just intentionally dishonest.
6177 2018-07-01 17:40:45 ...for every elastic thingy 
6178 2018-07-01 17:40:36 COCONUT OIL.
6179 2018-07-01 17:40:27 I felt angry and helpless many times but... it always felt like my fault, no one else's. I had good friends though, a good community. I sometimes wonder if I'd have bought the misogynist snake oil if I hadn't been insulated by good people in those vulnerable years.
6180 2018-07-01 17:40:26 リナちゃんどした？考え事か？可愛いけど無理すんなよ？(なでなで
6181 2018-07-01 17:40:19 He's exactly where he belongs. He's not better than DRose or Teague. Just because he's from Minnesota doesn't make him a better pg. He's a good oil guard, maybe even an above average defender but he can't score like D Rose or Teague.
6182 2018-07-01 17:40:15 This gives detail about their need of money (through sell of Aramaco") and desperation for alternate economic development. 

This video also used word "post oil economy".

So knowing this, every move looks in orderly manner.
6183 2018-07-01 17:40:08 You are rude fr tho lol
6184 2018-07-01 17:40:06 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
6185 2018-07-01 17:40:03 My suegra put a whole bottle of baby oil on my coco  #groomingtime!
6186 2018-07-01 17:39:54 Clove oil is also a natural anesthetic. When I had wisdom tooth surgery, my granny had me rest clove oil soaked cotton balls on my gums. It helped a lot. Taste isn’t great, just a heads up. Lol
6187 2018-07-01 17:39:46 Comedian Claims To Trump: How Dare You Stop Calling Press The EU, Says It Will Boost Oil Production #news_salad
6188 2018-07-01 17:39:31 "Occupied" a @netflix show about conflict between Norway and Russia over oil. When I described the show (forgot the name) to a Norwegian friend in the US then I remembered the name he said "accurate name" because of Crimea, etc... "It may happen one day to Norway."
6189 2018-07-01 17:39:29 O Q TA ACONTECENDO MEU DEUS
6190 2018-07-01 17:39:16 Ya, there is a transformer all the way to the left in the middle top shelf.
6191 2018-07-01 17:39:14 I’m the same way. Oil fan in SW Ontario. If I have to watch them all the time as I’m in their “viewing area” I hope to see good hockey.
6192 2018-07-01 17:38:51 The only way to prevent stretch marks is lubricating the skin from the inside since that is where the tearing occurs. A spoonful of cod liver oil a day should help prevent more tearing.
6193 2018-07-01 17:38:50 Have 2 male coworkers in their 40's. One is divorced, the other's wife lives in another country. Lately they've started full-body wrestling in the back room. I think its sexual tension but haven't said anything yet. I did suggest they take off their shirts & rub oil on eachother
6194 2018-07-01 17:38:37 100s of millions go to corporate America each year, and yes,this is welfare and so called Christians don't bat an eye,but feed poor people,  NEVER, what would Jesus say about that, look up the word subsidies, we give money to big oil co, to find oil,u know they can't afford it
6195 2018-07-01 17:38:26 Get some oil from the BP
6196 2018-07-01 17:38:19 Centers you could at the very least make an argument for:
McDavid
Matthews
Crosby
Eichel
Bergeron
Barkov
MacKinnon
Schiefele
Backstrom
Stamkos
6197 2018-07-01 17:38:18 I have too many bottles of flavored olive oil. And at least ten different ways to make coffee.
6198 2018-07-01 17:37:58 I remember 0bama said that the president could do nothing about oil and gasoline prices.
6199 2018-07-01 17:37:56 bio oil is real good
6200 2018-07-01 17:37:40 To upcoming preachers, preach the BIBLE not BOOKS. Don't sell oil, handkerchiefs, talisman that's superstitious ~Bishop J.B Masinde

You are Blessed #RKC
6201 2018-07-01 17:37:33 coconut oil
6202 2018-07-01 17:37:30 Midnight Oil. Rum, coffee, ginger and banana liqueurs, vanilla.
6203 2018-07-01 17:37:18 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
6204 2018-07-01 17:37:15 But,but,but, he sd he had increased the supply of oil. Bc the price of gasoline was too high!
6205 2018-07-01 17:37:03 Year 4 with best player in the world and somehow the bar is 'will be competitive for playoffs'. Chiarelli must have something on all the local media guys. Crazy
6206 2018-07-01 17:36:53 Your conclusions are disconnected from the facts.  US has remained engaged in Mideast oil wars for decades, entire anti-Russian tale was invented as bizarre excuse for Clinton's defeat.
6207 2018-07-01 17:36:46 Let's get real Donnie boy. It's you and your republican cohorts that created the fake shortage so the prices go up and big oil lines their pockets.
6208 2018-07-01 17:36:44 Getting an oil change right now and then going for a hike with my best friends later WOW this is being 22 for real, y’all
6209 2018-07-01 17:36:37 Some jobs that aren't hard but most people are afraid to do mechanics charge a lot for. Many need special tools these days and others have been made so you have to swap a major assembly instead of just the bad part from it. But generally I don't do oil or exhaust systems any more
6210 2018-07-01 17:36:29 I mean I think it had something to do with peak oil causing the collapse of society but okay I guess your take is the valid one.
6211 2018-07-01 17:36:26 Oilers in cap hell now haha. Oil fans saying the JT contract is "bad". When they have his salary tied up in Lucic and Russel. You pay your stars and don't fuck up on bottom six/bottom pair D.
6212 2018-07-01 17:36:06 No. They are acting on their behalf. They have vowed their Bakassi oil interest must be protected.
6213 2018-07-01 17:36:04 mek you ah chat bout you ah oil gun, ah mussy ya batty man brudda dem catch you ah oil down - gunshot ya life done, middle day before night come
6214 2018-07-01 17:35:55 YES I love roasting whole baby potatoes like this. So good with lemon-infused olive oil and sea salt
6215 2018-07-01 17:35:43 Bio oil is good at getting rid of scars/stretch marks. You do have to use it regularly and it can take a while to see results, though.
6216 2018-07-01 17:35:01 Ako lang ba yung di kumakapal kilay sa castor oil ?
6217 2018-07-01 17:35:00 Mukuma Allah bamu na gari
6218 2018-07-01 17:34:47 Price per barrel of crude oil is 80USD (R1100), 160 liters per barrel. R6.88 per liter of unrefined crude oil. Here you are asking for R5 per liter of refined petrol. Logic = 0
6219 2018-07-01 17:34:36 Could you really easily name ten centers better than John Tavares bc that seems like at least somewhat of a massive reach to me
6220 2018-07-01 17:34:32 The way some girls like guys with cars, you
will think they were breastfed with engine oil.
6221 2018-07-01 17:34:29 Totally agree, if Trump was sincere about making America great, he would seize this opportunity to support oil and gas exploration all over America!
6222 2018-07-01 17:34:20 My car has new tires, the alignment has been corrected and an oil change?? That’s MY amazing man.
6223 2018-07-01 17:34:20 Watching the @OtterTailCh Perham @BNSFRailway webcam, a pair of oil loads have passed by EB in the last hour, one with a pair of @CanadianPacific GE's and just now, a pair of CSX GE's (with an orange GE). The train with the CP GE's is coming up to Dower Lake at 1234.
6224 2018-07-01 17:34:15 I realllllly thought I was going to get my oil changed today. I’m not.
6225 2018-07-01 17:34:12 Sir, with due respect, this tweet is only half the story. What are their populations, what is the volume of oil and gas sold by each country?
6226 2018-07-01 17:34:03 UK "Manufacturing" sector is plants assembling mostly foreign parts, power generation, oil & gas production, & construction industry, plus lots of relatively small parts manufacturers & specialist manufacturers. If big assemblers leave post-Brexit, the parts companies go under
6227 2018-07-01 17:33:54 My whole stomach is a giant stretch mark so I have just learned to embrace them. I’ve heard some oils or lotions can help prevent them but won’t take them away. Bio oil is meant to be good. I’ve heard people say moisturising lotion with collagen in them are good too
6228 2018-07-01 17:33:53 Can you spray the need oil on a crop and then immediately eat the crop without washing it off first?

If not, move along to something else because it’s not a good alternative to normal pesticides.
6229 2018-07-01 17:33:50 But he's not one of the other best centres. Could easily name 10 who are better or just as good and far younger.
6230 2018-07-01 17:33:49 Still running like a top. Good compression. A couple of small oil leaks, uses about a quart between changes.
6231 2018-07-01 17:33:40 No cap space.  Thank goodness.
6232 2018-07-01 17:33:32 OPEC control production,  the oil price relates to international market trading.  The price of petrol at the pumps is what we pay after our government have loaded the levies. A liter of fuel costs less than R5.00 to reach the pumps,  the rest is govt. levies.
6233 2018-07-01 17:33:32 Sure. The collapse of oil power plays is also going to realign things as well, which will come with upheaval.
6234 2018-07-01 17:33:24 Tea tree oil is magic!!
6235 2018-07-01 17:33:20 I use olive oil, but I mainly eat fresh never fried foods.
6236 2018-07-01 17:33:12 Thanks G! Sweltering south of the county 
6237 2018-07-01 17:33:01 Wouldn't it be better to provide economic activity so those recieving this vegetable oil can afford to purchase it themselves. Wouldn't the glut of free vegetable oil depress the local market for vegetable oil? Won't those who rely on selling the oil be put out of business?
6238 2018-07-01 17:32:56 No actually you think of poor engineering and expensive aftermarket parts to make it even close to a reasonable product. Like Trump it lives and sells on noise and image, but has no real substance. Amazing what smoke and mirrors can make snake oil sound like
6239 2018-07-01 17:32:42 Not when it’s 100 degrees. It makes me 20x more likely to sweat soon as the sun hit me. Basically like cooking oil lol
6240 2018-07-01 17:32:42 Man, I gave my friend my Princess Diaries books to read and she left MANGO stains and oil from karahi on the pages!! I was so annoyed. 
Never again, man. Also men are trash js
6241 2018-07-01 17:32:19 今更ながらアナスタシアのフリクエやってる
6242 2018-07-01 17:32:16 I know people who have been pushing for solar/renewables so oil/gas is used only for export, but between IS, sheer incompetence and the big cheques being written to everyone by big oil it's just not being considered.
6243 2018-07-01 17:32:15 Tunisia and Algeria are on an olive oil *tariff quota* though? How generous is that?
6244 2018-07-01 17:32:13 How will the silly @theSNP party finance an independent Scotland?

Oil? Tourism? Or little industry they have? The UK will not substitute their nation, their wages or silly projects.

EU don't want them? And majority of Brits don't too.

6246 2018-07-01 17:32:04 "Moderate" Murkowski grinning like an idiot because they let her let oil companies destroy her own state in exchange for massively enriching billionaires was also quite something.
6247 2018-07-01 17:32:02 NNPC speaks on crude oil found in Niger
6248 2018-07-01 17:32:00 Cocoa butter  and cocoa oil
6249 2018-07-01 17:31:57 Bringing chemicals, gas and oil to be properly disposed... the land in our communities is our future #ReimagineVIPSweepstakes
6250 2018-07-01 17:31:46 If the best center in the world makes $12.5MM surely $11MM for one of the other best centers is reasonable
6251 2018-07-01 17:31:39 $15?! Where you go? Lol my oil changes are more than that
6252 2018-07-01 17:31:35 we all all know as long has the purse string in America are by certain people this will never change . the oil producing Arabs have to more and if means rationing oil so be it the west will soon tell Trump about how things work
6253 2018-07-01 17:31:27 ของมันเห็นๆกันอยู่
6254 2018-07-01 17:31:16 Trump tweeted that he called the Saudi king and ordered him to increase oil production by 2 million barrels a day.  This is how Al-Hayat (a mouthpiece of a Saudi prince) today described the call: "Trump and Saudi King stress the stability of oil markets".
6255 2018-07-01 17:31:14 Realize that the United States of America is the only oil company on Earth that owns its own army.
6256 2018-07-01 17:31:10 Yes. And they need to utilise their existing capacity fully to extract maximum in next decade. Else after that no use. Peak oil demand has been reached. Henceforth may be stagnation and then decline.
So Saudi need to cash Asap and look out for alternative income generation.
6257 2018-07-01 17:31:05 Looks like a flattering image of Jeff Goldblum to me to be honest. I would love to see more potraits of him. Perhaps oil paintings if you have the time.
6258 2018-07-01 17:31:03 made @AIMEESONG raw bars today. they were pretty good although i should definitely buy coconut oil for the next batch of bars cause i'm sure the olive oil altered the taste. nonetheless i think it was a success. 
6259 2018-07-01 17:30:50 The drilling permit was transfered to a company called Oil Quest  International in 2017 which is a subsidiary of Soco International
6260 2018-07-01 17:30:43 #bayrock russian oil mafia money laundring ....we are so good at that....#followthemoney
6261 2018-07-01 17:30:39 Yes, and shall we see what sect these extremists largely come from? And the solution isn't violence, it's embargos against the gulf states that provide money to these groups through oil profits.
6262 2018-07-01 17:30:38 This is b/c Don Swenney isn't very good at his job

6265 2018-07-01 17:30:03 Acidic. Im fucking dying, argan oil
6266 2018-07-01 17:30:03 More police officers deployed to guard Ngamia 8 oil field after protestors broke into site, Turkana County Commissioner Seif Matata says.

6268 2018-07-01 17:29:56 I often buy Tunisian olive oil in France. Very good too.
6269 2018-07-01 17:29:38 オイルの種類がやっと分かった
どんな何探しても無いから英語の動画でmineral oilってあったから探したら流動パラフィンって(ベビーオイル)意外と単純やった、、、
見つかって良かった！
取り寄せたら早速作業します！
6270 2018-07-01 17:29:36 Just put peppermint oil on my pits and they feel like they’re burning off. This is the second time I’ve done this 
6271 2018-07-01 17:29:35 @FoxNews @WhiteHouse No matter what you hear from the White House, it was I that called the Saudi King and demanded he pump out more oil to make up for Iran. We will soon drown in oil..oil..oil!
6272 2018-07-01 17:29:34 He does exactly move the needle
6273 2018-07-01 17:29:30 Of course the snake oil salesman says it works!
The tool described here could be a useful teaching aid but should not be used for an important final assessment. State of the art AI has the neural capacity of an insect. Do you really think a beetle can judge writing?
6274 2018-07-01 17:29:29 Stand by what I said heading into free agency, John Tavares isn't a $10M+ player but kudos to the Maple Leafs for going out and getting their guy. Just an fyi, you may want to push up the timeline on upgrading of that backend.
6275 2018-07-01 17:29:22 Stop using fish oil based deodorants.
6276 2018-07-01 17:29:20 気のせいじゃなかった
6277 2018-07-01 17:29:09 ？揺れた気がしたけど気のせいかな
6278 2018-07-01 17:29:00 He has no understanding of U.S internal relations or economics either!

After failing to bully Saudi Arabia to increase Oil Production, Trump still cannot understand that OPEC is an organization of Sovereign Countries!
6279 2018-07-01 17:28:53 I know you'll be here
6280 2018-07-01 17:28:52 Something deliciously comical about "100% green energy" advocates touting Norway's economic situation without knowing it's exclusively due to being oil rich.
6281 2018-07-01 17:28:50 กล่าวหาว่ะ
6282 2018-07-01 17:28:40 Btw. Yr all blocked so stop waisting time replying I will not see it.
6283 2018-07-01 17:28:13 Don’t let the Tavares deal get you away from the fact that the oil signed Kyle Brodziak today. #centerdepth
6284 2018-07-01 17:28:10 They’ve gone this far, mine as well give Eberle back to the oil.
6285 2018-07-01 17:28:10 รู้นะว่าพี่ตั้งใจพิมพ์ผิด
6286 2018-07-01 17:28:08 Yeah, I’ve been using a 40,000 IU vitamin e oil on them twice a day for like six months, and I haven’t seen much improvement  I’ll have to look into those other things!
6287 2018-07-01 17:28:07 Public adversary policy of the Care Takers; Hike in oil prices, hike in everything ? Who will benefits from that money ? #Lahore @BBhuttoZardari @OfficialMqm #Government #Admin
6288 2018-07-01 17:28:05 No, they didn't ... Didnt check oil stocks , but influencing prices with false statements is a federal crime in usa ?
6289 2018-07-01 17:27:54 Bio oil has also helped me! It takes a while to see results, and I had to apply twice a day but it’s worth it when I do.
6290 2018-07-01 17:27:42 20180629 Brent oil

6294 2018-07-01 17:27:10 Claire just made caprese salad with trader Joe's balsamic (instead of the 30 year aged balsamico we got in Tuscany), pure olive oil (instead of the $30 bottle of Tunisian unfiltered EV) and Diamond kosher salt (instead of the Fleur de Sel we got in Paris)  #fwp
6295 2018-07-01 17:27:09 หวาวว เย้ๆ ติดด้วยแน่ะะ เพราะช่วงนี้ได้คุยกันมากขึ้นอีกนิดสินะคะะ! 
6296 2018-07-01 17:27:06 What a wet fire cracker..a dud...his press conference will just be another snake oil speech
6297 2018-07-01 17:27:05 I hate going get my oil change  this niggas annoying
6298 2018-07-01 17:27:01 Jojoba oil is literally liquid Gold for my skin
6299 2018-07-01 17:26:49 It's an oil painting I've been working on for the past while now. I've been painting space art for almost five years now.
6300 2018-07-01 17:26:44 Sometimes our best pictures are the oil and when I tell people that they would be better off without you..
6301 2018-07-01 17:26:42 Good old King Edward Potatoes, peeled and chipped as thick as your thumb, par boil in water, dry in a towel then place in the freezer for an hour. Heat oil to 130c, fry for 5 mins, back to freezer, 1 hr, reheat oil to 180c, fry 7 mins. Its a faff but so worth it!
6302 2018-07-01 17:26:41 @profit_raining can share your view on oil for this week please
6303 2018-07-01 17:26:30 No kidding!!!  It will be interesting to see how the TO media discuss how it will be no problem to sign everyone. After how they bash the OIL at every turn.
6304 2018-07-01 17:26:23 Ooo! Ooo! Then do SF and LA!
6305 2018-07-01 17:26:12 How did you get that revelation? 
6306 2018-07-01 17:26:03 @ovofnm dude I’m finally going to the pool to tan. Literally have tanning oil on me right now. I tried to find a picture of an oiled up white guy to drive the picture home for you...but porn kept popping up. 
6307 2018-07-01 17:26:00 Oil production was halted before breakdown in 2013 due to Sudanese oil pipeline tolls. If that isn't finalized in a long-term agreement, which is fair to both sides, rehabilitation is pointless. If GOSS,now desperate, let's Bashir charge whatever he wants, more disaster.
6308 2018-07-01 17:25:59 Ah, but he is promoting more drilling in the Gulf and rolling back regulations on off-shore drillers, so that we can have another Deepwater Horizon oil spill.....
6309 2018-07-01 17:25:57 ไม่เทค้าบบบ
6310 2018-07-01 17:25:47 What happened to decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil.
6311 2018-07-01 17:25:45 Its been slow im Venezuela's case, horribly slow. But still, Maduro can buy will from other countries thru cheap oíl trade. 280+ killed +500 or so gone in 2 months and  yet this isnt called a massacre or a dictator. Nor sanctions upon the killers aside visas revokes. #Nicaragua

6313 2018-07-01 17:25:37 "Erm... do you want some oil?" She felt kind of bad, looking at him looking at the soup so sadly.

6315 2018-07-01 17:25:25 The state-run Saudi Press Agency confirmed Saturday that Trump had spoken w/ Salman on the phone about the need 2 “maintain stability of oil markets,” But there was no mention of any agreement or oil amount. The president was calling on the Saudis 2 ignore their commitment 2 OPEC

6317 2018-07-01 17:25:02 You can get headaches if you stop using them , along with that 15,000 people die as a result of aspirin every year . Whereas marijuana don't kill anyone , is a natural painkiller , in a oil form helps stop fits . Your idea of making it illegal wouldn't help shit

6322 2018-07-01 17:24:20 I really dislike acrylic. I'm going to give oil my best shot. I really like the look of the medium and feel it would be the best for some of the things I want to paint. I'm going to take a class too so I'm sure they'll talk about safety.
6323 2018-07-01 17:23:56 Also, I gotta buy beard oil now. This thing is getting long.
6324 2018-07-01 17:23:47 Yes because it’s the looks of the Prophet that shaytan cannot take. As I heard one scholar he said shaytan can come as a far person saying he’s Prophet
6325 2018-07-01 17:23:42 Break oil pls
6326 2018-07-01 17:23:38 But Baru has been wasting our resources in looking for oil in the north while the country suffer.
6327 2018-07-01 17:23:19 She has mistaken vinegar and coconut oil for water..
6328 2018-07-01 17:23:17 Bio oil is really good !!
6329 2018-07-01 17:23:13 They could have your server any time ? And a @potus tweeting a big oil country is increasing production , is not manipulating (stock) markets ? Maybe even a crime

6331 2018-07-01 17:22:59 anything rich in vitamin E will be helpful for scarring! Look for skincare products full of avocado butters and oils and wheatgerm oil!

6335 2018-07-01 17:22:27 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
6336 2018-07-01 17:22:19 Potential is worthless. Knowledge is worthless. Ideas are worthless...

In the same way that crude oil is worthless.

If you don't transform it into something useful then it is, by definition, a waste.
6337 2018-07-01 17:22:18 I asked the financers of 9/11 to pump more oil for us because prices spiled when I cancelled the U.N. supervised denuclearization of Iran.
6338 2018-07-01 17:22:09 I’m a little bit too excited to re-up on peppermint essential oil. Lemongrass has worn me tf out, until 2020.
6339 2018-07-01 17:22:07 I used to do everything on mine but it just isn't worth it much of the time anymore. By the time you are done doing an oil change can cleaning up the mess and disposing of the stuff your time has to be worth very little to come out ahead.
6340 2018-07-01 17:22:04 Honestly those two topics bring out the snake oil salesmen. I think the technology has some promise, but it's not a cure all.

6343 2018-07-01 17:21:50 A lot of people don’t use oil because of the solvents. They can be harsh and make you sick. Maybe try acrylics? Look into Golden Open? They dry a little slower. Or look at a retarder for whatever brand you choose. They’re no oils, but give you a little more workability.
6344 2018-07-01 17:21:49 @CNBC but $GS said no?  Lol and yes to $200 oil?  @elonmusk great job double production in a qt!  @grassosteve @LaMonicaBuzz
6345 2018-07-01 17:21:44 @IslesWhiteSUV Let’s change that oil and see where we end up.
6346 2018-07-01 17:21:36 Well since you like Sonic 06, Planet Wisp in Generations, Oil Ocean in Mania, 2 over 3&K ad hate CD and etc, I don't expect anything less from you lol
6347 2018-07-01 17:21:35 I was 10. We used to slather oil on our skin to speed up a tan & lemon juice in our hair to give us blonde highlights. Surprisingly this resulted in red raw skin and dried up straw locks.
6348 2018-07-01 17:21:25 Less consultant more trainer - as it happens, I refer to Tom's work in some training and have respect for him but we part ways here. Nobody hurt - both adults. Try it.

P.S. No snake oil. No need. #Restorative practice is simple, #respectful and effective
6349 2018-07-01 17:21:23 so in a year of half decent oil prices they still run an $8B deficit? wow. 

too bad they're giving away the resource for nickels still. and refusing to tax at even the most minimal level... #abpoli
6350 2018-07-01 17:21:22 Bio oil worked for fading mine but they are still very white, thick and visible
6351 2018-07-01 17:21:14 We don't need a president that will promise us good roads, we need someone that'll implement good polices;
No trailers during the day.
No police checkpoints.
SARS actually taking over roads to stop armed robbers.
Restructuring the oil industry, let's refine our oil ourselves.
6352 2018-07-01 17:20:58 #ESP are out of the #WorldCup? Knocked out by #RUS and Akinfeev is a national hero!

His reward? A red star? A 50ft statue? His own oil company? perhaps even his own former Soviet state?

Looks like Putin finally has an opponent who he can't assassinate or beat! #Akinfeev4Russia
6353 2018-07-01 17:20:50 CEPO should be more realistic & logical in making statements. B4 allocating any percentage there should be an agreement in place. Otherwise, the gov't can still building-up for wars. Oil production should not starts in this month. #WeNeedPeace
6354 2018-07-01 17:20:49 I'm entirely done with the cult of babying cast iron.  I'm putting this fucker in the dish washer and I'll oil it later.
6355 2018-07-01 17:20:47 Shoulda let them work it out in the battlefield of ideas
6356 2018-07-01 17:20:46 Oil export or outsourcing was done during Ahmadinejad presidency. They were able to circumvent sanctions.
6357 2018-07-01 17:20:42 I use Bio Oil/Cocoa Oil but thats more for pain /itchiness! Dont know what you're after but those help a few of my deeper ones 
6358 2018-07-01 17:20:42 That’s a fairly twatish thing to say tbh, you are an embarrassment to people who think they should drill oil in the Weald for the right reasons, and in the most environmentally friendly, low key way as possible.  Which is what ukog are doing.
6359 2018-07-01 17:20:41 I didn’t put Argan oil in my hair last night when I washed it and I can def tell today..... 
6360 2018-07-01 17:20:38 Okay, everyone! We're going to try to raise $150 today for the Oil Valley Film Festival. I'm going to get a coffee in me and we'll be off and running. The #OVFF brings global cinema to Pennsylvania's Oil Region. #film #twitterfunding #fundraising #w00t
6361 2018-07-01 17:20:22 Now Libya's NOC confirms that closure of oil ports in the country this past week has led to loss of 850k b/d. What a weekend for oil and OPEC! #OOTT (And it's not over yet).

6365 2018-07-01 17:20:05 Nice CGI graphic!  (look at the asphalt texture.  Way too uniform.  Real parking lots have oil stains from filthy ICE cars)   It just proves our point that the competition is *vaporware*.  That charging station doesn't exist!

6369 2018-07-01 17:19:41 As China takes soybean contracts to Russia we'll be using less oil in Midwest this year due to reduced fuel consumption on idle farm equipment. @realDonaldTrump egotistical tariffs are going to screw farmers. @VelshiRuhle @RWPUSA @RedTRaccoon
6370 2018-07-01 17:19:19 I don't feel like celebrating this year. I think the 637% gain to #KM of taxpayer's $s is just to over the top. I loath that the #lpc/#cpc tagteam subsidizes/bailsout corporations but a Texas Oil Giant is treasonous imo.

6381 2018-07-01 17:18:20 U do know that most pre-chavez govts called themsely socialist? Ditto in Mexico? History aside Chavez had the oil boom and could've done so much but instead just stole so much.....

6383 2018-07-01 17:17:35 Does anyone have scar gel/cream recommendations for fading scars? I’ve been using vitamin oil, but it just isn’t doing the trick, despite consistently using it for several months. Maybe my scars are just stubborn, I don’t know, but I’d appreciate recommendations!
6384 2018-07-01 17:17:30 It’s like an oil paint for a moment. Good shot though.

6389 2018-07-01 17:17:03 With due respect to Dubas, who I believe is going to be real good in his role for a long time, this likely had far less to do w/ him and much more to do with those above his pay grade.

6396 2018-07-01 17:16:21 There is a palm oil processing Mill in Ukanafun. I have headache each time I look at the facility lying wasted. Could it be as a result of the fact that it was fixed by former Gov Attah? But government is supposed to be a continuum.

6414 2018-07-01 17:14:52 Chavez replaced knowledgeable oil workers with his supporters.  He did not reinvest to keep production up and used too much of the money on socialist programs.  It is estimated that Venezuela has more reserves than Saudi Arabia.

6418 2018-07-01 17:14:16 Idiot, begging Saudia Arabia to increase oil production will only make the price of oil go even higher seeing as how Trump has created a 'desperation need'. You want the oil America and desperately need it then you are going to pay more.
6419 2018-07-01 17:14:16 Less petrol used = less oil imports = less money leaving the UK economy
6420 2018-07-01 17:14:13 Well duh...... when you have private jets & helicopters the cost of jet fuel can be concerning. Lower oil prices means lower fuel prices means he could have acted rich much cheaper. Now he’s flying on the taxpayer’s dime..... what is one supposed to do?
6421 2018-07-01 17:14:11 I agree! 
We need more oil to burn capitalist american flags!
6422 2018-07-01 17:14:05 Oil per barrel dropped below $50 a barrel over 6 weeks ago ( normal time it takes to reflect at pumps), yet we see the same high prices  this is due to a variety of causes - but your tax is the reason prices are staying high 
6423 2018-07-01 17:14:05 I’m dating the sweetest guy. I leave my debit card at the bar and he offeres to get it for me while I’m at work. I can’t find time to get an oil change and he offers to take it in for me. I won’t let him do these things but the fact that he offers is just 
6424 2018-07-01 17:14:03 Absolutely and will steadily increase! Not everyone is mislead by mainstream (paid for by big oil and legacy auto) media.

6431 2018-07-01 17:13:29 well Venezuelas oil was the same way until it tanked. Also could be the taxes

6445 2018-07-01 17:11:52 Yes!! I got the 250 mg oil dropper but I have used cbd biscuits on Guapo (for his back hip pain) and they did seem to work also! But the oil definitely kicked in faster/had him comfortable knocked out
6446 2018-07-01 17:11:41 no mention of oil and trade deals in the article
6447 2018-07-01 17:11:35 All that freakin baby oil... and conditioner... and dawn soap 
6448 2018-07-01 17:11:20 So @realDonaldTrump doesnt  manipulate it by calling people in The Middle East and ordering them to produce more oil/day  and then bragging about it on #twitter?

Strange world we live in..

6450 2018-07-01 17:11:17 Venezuela was the subject of an extremely shitty and corrupt government, they compounded their decline by incorrectly and stupidly implementing their socialist-esk policies. They would of went to shit even in a capitalist economy cuz their only source of income was oil.
6451 2018-07-01 17:11:00 I would go with cold mezes for zeytinyağlılar. Honestly there sometimes isn't even olive oil, especially with dolma and sarma.
6452 2018-07-01 17:10:54 Old fashioned oil based soaps.
6453 2018-07-01 17:10:54 พล็อตที่เท่าไหร่กันแล้วค่ะ โอ้ยยย พล็อตน่าลั่นน่าอ่านมากค่ะ นี่เรื่องยาวดอฟลอว์ที่เหมือนคุณพ่อขายาวยังเขียนไม่ไปถึงไหนเลยนะคะ ว่าจะเขียนแค่เรื่องนั้นแท้ๆค่ะ 5555555555
6454 2018-07-01 17:10:41 The best part was when you had to tweet the olive oil tariffs for the third time.

What about the quotas thing? Are there quotas on Everything But Arms, or is she wrong about that too?
6455 2018-07-01 17:10:34 You want a Russia conspiracy? Okay... We got into cold war middle east cause Russia and Oil. So thus They made US prop up Saudis which then gave Wahhabism to Bin Laden that then started 9/11... ??????… Russia-gate, nailed it. (feel free to laugh now.)

6457 2018-07-01 17:10:14 I am beginning to realize you might not have any kids..but displaying other folks videos and kids pics..so you can garner sympathy for commiting fraud. how low you can go man? If you had kids you will not make a complete mockery and display of them
6458 2018-07-01 17:10:09 >wake up 
>immediately bleach hair cuz the feeling of oil in it is just Too Much
6459 2018-07-01 17:10:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
6460 2018-07-01 17:10:05 Like who? You're getting pounded in all directions.

Most of our country is natural resources... You had to beg a prince to make more oil.
6461 2018-07-01 17:10:04 แพ้มากค่ะ ตอนที่เคยเลี้ยงนี้ติดบ้านเพราะมันเลย แต่เสียดายที่น้องหมดอายุขัยไวไปหน่อยนะคะ ฮืออออ เคยมีความคิดอยากเลี้ยงกระรอกให้มันมาไต่ๆบนตัวด้วยค่ะ รู้สึกว่ามันเท่ แต่พอซื้อชูก้า ไกรเดอร์มาเลี้ยงนี้แบบผิดคาดมากๆค่ะ ทั้งดื้อทั้งซน เอามาไต่บนตัวนี้แผลเต็มค่ะ ฮืออออออออออ
6462 2018-07-01 17:09:55 Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production according to President Creme de la Creme de la Connards?
I stopped believing anything Trump communicates a long time ago.
Do you trust his words?
6463 2018-07-01 17:09:49 Hence Proved today

6464 2018-07-01 17:09:47 I always enjoy seeing odd and interesting things, especially from you Matt. I don't care if it's snake oil or not!
6465 2018-07-01 17:09:45 Oh the elephant woke up. Jeez bitter man. Who are you calling morron. You have a picture of an elephant for crying out loud. Time block yr ass.
6466 2018-07-01 17:09:44 The demand outlook for olive oil improved recently on increased Russian demand.  Russia, who is currently hosting the World Cup..... 

whoops... 
ok, what about soybeans?  
Sorry, my friend! Spain’s loss my loss too.
6467 2018-07-01 17:09:36 New favorite drink:  Anything from @drinkbai plus a scoop of @perfectketones vanilla MCT oil.  Man oh man talk about tasty AND the perfect fuel for your body!
6468 2018-07-01 17:09:18 You know I took advantage of the fact that we have a zero turn mower and mowed with tanning oil on... Bad idea now I have grass like glued to me
6469 2018-07-01 17:09:09 Real oil news vs baseless Trump bloviating!
6470 2018-07-01 17:08:47 Meanwhile in Oil country we continue to go backwards while keeping our fingers crossed for next season. "IF" only all our players play to potential
6471 2018-07-01 17:08:42 As long as Oil can show them we can contend before their contracts expire we’re good.   If not, than the Oilers deserve it.  (Oh god, Tavares joined his childhood fav team.)
6472 2018-07-01 17:08:41 @sas at the Athens airport is so rude and inconsistent.First attendant says I can move heavy items (bottles of wine and olive oil too large to go in security) into my carryon and check it for free, but it’s too soon to check in.Night girl says 70€ for overweight or extra bag??
6473 2018-07-01 17:08:40 If you get hacked, you don't belong in this space. Go trade oil or pharm stocks.
6474 2018-07-01 17:08:37 What I find interesting is her profile and a link to Christian Democrats...  those two are like trying to mix oil and water.
6475 2018-07-01 17:08:30 So the narrative is that crude #oil will push higher this week after #Trump and #Lybia news because of spare capacity and outages. #OOTT #opec

6477 2018-07-01 17:08:20 You can't fight big oil but you can stop driving your car.
6478 2018-07-01 17:08:15 These things will eventually come back to him when he'll have to make the choice between a boiling oil bath or dismemberment through horse.
6479 2018-07-01 17:08:04 "Munyes had been speaking at a funeral in Kakauma, Turkana West, when residents started chanting 'Mafuta ni yetu (The oil is yours)'" surely, @TheStarKenya you can do better than this, spellcheck, translation (English to Swahili) #GitheriMedia
6480 2018-07-01 17:07:59 I'm also wondering why nothing in your thread actually mention the fact that in 1976, the year your thread starts, is the year they decided to nationalize the oil industry. I'm sure such a socialist based move had nothing to do with the collapse of the country that you described.
6481 2018-07-01 17:07:43 De Gea is Overrated....Gears rusted already...baba needs oil

6483 2018-07-01 17:07:20 Totally disagree that #BigData is overrated. Just because association is not causation doesn't mean association isn't producing important novel insights. #BigData will do for medicine what fracking did to the oil industry.

6485 2018-07-01 17:07:12 The WH late Saturday issued a statement backing down from this tweet that you had  convinced Saudi Arabia’s king to produce as much as 2 million barrels of additional oil a day to bring prices down. More Trump fake news lies. Your own admin can't believe your lies.
6486 2018-07-01 17:07:01 1st u better know oil & gas eco & then talk.
6487 2018-07-01 17:07:00 I went to market today, an old woman bought mustard oil in a plastic bucket, and the bucket broke after few steps most of the oil spilled on road. And she was collecting that oil with her hands. I wanted to help but I was afraid how would she respond 
6488 2018-07-01 17:06:56 This is why Trump is meeting with Putin. Oil. Not world peace, Syria or NK.

6490 2018-07-01 17:06:52 The snake oil salesman strikes again
6491 2018-07-01 17:06:36 One day, nearly all jobs will be automated. We're better off allowing this automation while taxing these billion dollar companies (who pay $0 in tax) to pay for a universal income. Or we could just start declaring major corporations like Oil & Gas /Walmart as Gov Public Utilities
6492 2018-07-01 17:06:27 Childish for bringing me oil in one container and vinegar in another for my salad dressing.
6493 2018-07-01 17:06:19 I really don't know why more people don't know about it, it's just an amazing oil and so therapeutic in lots of other ways too x  do you use essential oils regularly?  X

6495 2018-07-01 17:06:05 
6496 2018-07-01 17:06:01 We will see this fight with OPEC turn into a argument for lifting sanctions on Russian Oil Sales.

6500 2018-07-01 17:05:37 I am sorry to hear about your pain.
I suffered with chronic pain for years.Then I found an acupuncturist who in addition to her treatment also got me onto Charlotte’s Web Advanced CBD Oil. I have just about been able to get off opiods completely. There is hope in other treatment.
6501 2018-07-01 17:05:11 #Ayurveda recommends #abhyanga (#ayurvedic oil massage) before exercise, which is another reason why it works well to exercise in the morning, after your morning massage. This will tone the muscles, get the blood circulating and prevent injury or strain.
6502 2018-07-01 17:05:01 え、まって、これやっちゃったかもしれん
6503 2018-07-01 17:04:56 We do have oil in Venezuela and there is no uproar either

6506 2018-07-01 17:04:21 Can certainly understand the disappointment but w/ due respect to Tavares, he isn't worth what he's going to get. Again, nothing wrong with being down b/c of the decision but the Isles future will be just fine. Book it.

6508 2018-07-01 17:04:16 You could help the U.S. increase oil production instead.
6509 2018-07-01 17:04:06 We don’t need or want more oil...we’re all moving to electric cars, wind & solar energy...NO MORE FOSSIL FUELS!
6510 2018-07-01 17:04:01 Exactly,gas here in TX is $3.00 a gallon & it keeps climbing, yet Crude is still far lower than it was when it was $4.00+! Trump owns oil and gas stocks, that's why he was so damn set on pipeline, to make PROFITS! Sadly supporters don't care that He's self profiting as President

6515 2018-07-01 17:03:34 The presence of oil in Iran and the lack of submissiveness to American imperial dictums must not be overlooked.  Persians will never forget the US-inspired 1953 coup! 
6516 2018-07-01 17:03:31 Swell, now oil prices and gas prices will go through the roof. Any guess as to how lousy a businessman Trump is or how stupid?
6517 2018-07-01 17:03:25 It’s a U.K. onshore oil exploration company/producer claiming to have BBO resource.  Of course it’ll attract investors and sentiment #UKOG
6518 2018-07-01 17:03:23 Long term, it could be very good for peace in the middle-east, as the oil power dynamics have been quite pathological.
6519 2018-07-01 17:03:13 My mom just told me to take cbd oil for my anxiety 
6520 2018-07-01 17:03:13 What I got from this, Trump wants the other countries to stop receiving Iranian oil and have it redirected to the US. 
Meaning that he wants to be the ONLY recipient of Iranian oil.

6532 2018-07-01 17:01:40 I like how you say that without anything bothersome like proof you feel you need to deal with. Sixty five percent? And what form of govt aid are they on? Should all people who get oil I aid be randomly taxed as well?

6540 2018-07-01 17:00:49 This was confirmed by SDN's mini of oil last nite on Sudan TV Al-Wajah by Ahmed Bilal. This is hidden under section 5 of KDA of 27/6/18.

6547 2018-07-01 17:00:13 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

6581 2018-07-01 16:55:50 Econ 101: when you take oil off the market through sanctions, prices rise
6582 2018-07-01 16:55:46 Umm, I'll take that.
6583 2018-07-01 16:55:41 I wonder how long it will take for Putin to make the Russian goalie minister of oil or some other ridiculous state position. The man won't buy his own vodka shots in Russia for the rest of his life.
6584 2018-07-01 16:55:38 そうなんですよねえ、お部屋も汚れるだろうし、餌も何でもいいわけでもないし。勝ってみたいなとは思う…

6587 2018-07-01 16:55:21 Good point. I may I write about the olive oil market instead...

6592 2018-07-01 16:55:08 Massage shredded kale with salt, then work in avocado lemon juice and olive oil. One of Nature's perfect alchemies. It actually makes kale taste good.
6593 2018-07-01 16:55:08 Though Islanders fans are feeling down at the moment. In the long run, by not badly overpaying Tavares in both $$$ and term it will make the Isles a far better team. #Reality @TheNLKing
6594 2018-07-01 16:55:01 OPEC must have oil hidden in some drawer somewhere that we don’t know about. If Saudi Arabia (according to Trump) has agreed to bring on 2m extra barrels, is there anything else left in OPEC?
6595 2018-07-01 16:55:00  Spain lost against Oil Miners @iamnights and u said there were gonna win the world cup
6596 2018-07-01 16:54:58 How many years has he been an mp and he still doesnt know how our democracy works. He is such a snake oil salesman......

6598 2018-07-01 16:54:47 @realDonaldTrump 

More lies From President Bone Spurs.

The Saudis NEVER agreed to increase oil production.

Another loss for the Liar In Chief.
6599 2018-07-01 16:54:43 Let’s all congratulate Russia’s goalkeeper over his new oil field #worldcup #esprus
6600 2018-07-01 16:54:38 They started with 3 items easily obtained in the US.

Wait until the really big stuff starts.  Like oil.

6602 2018-07-01 16:54:21 actually the Libyan oil is not lost - has to be sold on other channels

6606 2018-07-01 16:53:58 That pic was the last two that were left from the batch I made last night! The recipe said 350 degrees for the oil.
6607 2018-07-01 16:53:55 Only the wine and oil of the Holy Spirit is faithful to the King, no flesh can ever be.
6608 2018-07-01 16:53:46 Yea if they continue to steal the oil from Yemen.
6609 2018-07-01 16:53:28 Also the mistaken assumption that both Tamil and southern culture owe nothing to Sanskrit or the sanskritic megalapolis. I am amazed at how well this snake oil has been sold abroad to foriegners.
6610 2018-07-01 16:53:24 Nope Benezuela is a oil exporting nations which is a failed state. Thanks to Chavismo.
6611 2018-07-01 16:53:08 @McDonalds why does YOUR sprite hit harder than the SPRITE
6612 2018-07-01 16:53:01 Girl you never put coconut oil on a healing tat, never!!
6613 2018-07-01 16:53:00 I will say this Mr. Trump many of your votes came from oilfield hands like myself so be careful with oil. If you reduce the price we lose our jobs and you lose loads of votes.
6614 2018-07-01 16:52:58 @kaufpost is referring to governance and development outcomes here, not the economic performance of mining operations themselves. In this regard the data supports his statement pretty clearly.
6615 2018-07-01 16:52:41 i’ve been using aloe vera gel mixed w olive oil as a lotion n i love it!
6616 2018-07-01 16:52:35 Palm oil stew? Just turn it to of ads sauce
6617 2018-07-01 16:52:32 Lifetime free oil to the russian team
6618 2018-07-01 16:52:22 The #US-#SaudiArabia deal for Saudi to increase her oil output by 2 Million barrels amount to a unilateral action & display of selfishness on the part of Saudi, capable of undermining the unity of #OPEC. #Nigeria must condemn the action in the interest of her recovering economy.
6619 2018-07-01 16:52:22 Why did Oil sign a backup w 4 nhl games experience for $2.5M?
6620 2018-07-01 16:52:20 They just rename it Iraqi oil since Iraq is basically an Iran client state at this point.
6621 2018-07-01 16:52:18 Ran the streets fuckin wit Gunna til like 5 in the morning just gettin up back on the oil
6622 2018-07-01 16:52:13 なんだなんだ。もう深夜だぞ寝ようよ

6624 2018-07-01 16:52:04 @Avitaddis9 Tried everything but the cloves oil so far will have to get some tomorrow. Painkillers paras and nurofen take some edge off but that's all. Tried the whiskey it works breifly, got some oragel which somehow made it worse. I'm resorting to ten cans of lager now ha ha
6625 2018-07-01 16:52:01 Oil producing countries are getting worried now. And for countries who were relying on it to rebuild like Iraq it's a disaster.
6626 2018-07-01 16:52:00 oil to rub your feet
6627 2018-07-01 16:52:00 Thank you WAPF for teaching me about pastured animal foods, cod liver oil, raw milk, wild seafood, and a whole foods diet.

6630 2018-07-01 16:51:34 The 9/11 terrorists were from the country that recently entered into an oil production agreement with Russia, and was part of the interference in the presidential election, so our corrupt @POTUS will only speak of them with love no matter how many buildings they fly planes into.
6631 2018-07-01 16:51:30 Coconut oil is the answer
6632 2018-07-01 16:51:28 After leaving the car alone for the day a big old drop of oil has formed on the rear main oil seal  will get cracking on gearbox removal later.
6633 2018-07-01 16:51:26 I know right?!  Where’s the news that we traded for Kessel, Karlsson and Tavares took a discount to sign with the Oil??

6638 2018-07-01 16:51:14 desperate times call for desperate measures. i used nallennai/sesame oil to make pasta arrabiata sauce. turns out it was fantastic.
6639 2018-07-01 16:51:13 Ho FFS ! How do you like your president lying to you every god damn day ? “The White House issued a statement backing down from President Trump’s earlier tweet that said he had persuaded Saudi Arabia to produce as 2 million additional barrels of oil a day to bring prices down”
6640 2018-07-01 16:51:13 Hahaaaa! Our coconut oil is for the dog, i think that makes it worse.

6648 2018-07-01 16:50:28 cleanse > toner/acids > aloe > serums > moisturizer (> oil)
that's what I prefer anyway. aloe usually sinks right into the skin and doesn't leave any residue, so it's easier for it to absorb if there isn't any heavier products already on it !

6663 2018-07-01 16:48:50 First of all, all countries and companies who deal with Iran will be bullied and blocked.. Second, all transactions will be in dollar and America will block it.. 
So Iran will have to barter, and get rubbish for it's oil and gas from China and India.. Problem it is..
6664 2018-07-01 16:48:43 @BrunoTshibala  Mr. Prime Minister - I am urging you to reconsider granting permission to drill for oil to Soco International in the Congo.  Members of your country fight and die everyday to protect Mountain Gorillas which your country is blessed to have native to your land.

6670 2018-07-01 16:48:22 Of course he's agreed to increase production.  But has he agreed to decrease prices? If you knew anything about economics, you would know that oil is sold as a commodity - NOT BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
6671 2018-07-01 16:48:22 I think the Oil is done .... unless they can find some for 3 dimes and an empty coke can.
6672 2018-07-01 16:48:20 80% of the oil paintings I’ve received from Magic artists have pet hair embedded in them.  
6673 2018-07-01 16:48:19 Despite yet another silly Trump effort to try and analyze/push the oil market, this story (Libya now down 850k b/d) is the only real piece of news this weekend.  Losing 850k Libya plus VZ plus Iran plus flat Permian means eating into virtually all global spare capacity #OOTT
6674 2018-07-01 16:48:13 Wow in speech less, can’t believe Spain our out. Well done Russia let the party begin   This just makes it even more interesting for @England . CMON England  #ThreeLions #Russia2018

6676 2018-07-01 16:48:11 true. They ARE capitalist, and struggle with all the problems that are inherent in that system. They also have large oil reserves off their northern coast that they use to fund a lot of their social programs

6683 2018-07-01 16:47:54 WHEN ARE AMERICAN'S GOING TO DEMAND THAT @POTUS STOP LYING TO THEM - LIES SOLELY INTENTED TO DECEIVEIN ORDER TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK GOOD.  Trump's tweet about a he made a deal with Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to lower gas prices - IT WAS A LIE THAT THE WH HAD TO BACK DOWN FROM.
6684 2018-07-01 16:47:48 Did you ask why NK is still testing?   What about WH backing off Trump's tweet claiming Saudi agreed to produce more oil??
6685 2018-07-01 16:47:45 @limbaugh my spiritual father was a prophet. He passed away before the election. He told me of Trump being president 3 years prior. What we are witnessing is someone God placed in authority. When Trump came to dallas during campaign he was annointed with oil by great men of God.
6686 2018-07-01 16:47:45 Akinfeev bout to be “gifted” a nice little oil company
6687 2018-07-01 16:47:39 Might be one of the reasons the oil sucked?

He should get 30-40 something in the game totals, barring injuries...

He has since been arrested by the Police.
6689 2018-07-01 16:47:37 It’s not just president Trump. Look what gov of Texas said other day about US oil production-completely off base, misninformation, etc. but he’s a politician making a politicians statement. Maduro did it last week when he said Venezuela is ready to production another million bpd

6735 2018-06-29 23:56:22 Aw thank you! Garnier fructise leave in, black castor oil and i used the castor oil eco styler this day!
6736 2018-06-29 23:56:14 Grilled Salmon,  and steamed cabbage, carrots and zucchini with extra virgin olive oil and pepper
6737 2018-06-29 23:56:09 It kills me how many times I go the feed of a pro-car tweeter and see it loaded with progressive politics. When you argue for LA as a car city, you're just a big oil/auto shill. It's hypocritical to hate Trump for pulling out of Paris but fight for his policies in your hood.
6738 2018-06-29 23:55:57 They taking all day just for a oil change
6739 2018-06-29 23:55:46 In Ghana it's called Ab3 (Twi)
We use it for soup (ab3-nkwan), eaten with fufu, banku, omotuo ( rice balls) and kokonte 
Oil is also made from it ( red oil)
6740 2018-06-29 23:55:33 その昔、「OIL OIL OIL.」と鉛筆で書くとサザエさんの歌のリズムになるってトリビアがあったよね。
6741 2018-06-29 23:55:04 It's a public secret that oil companies are secretly threatening people who are trying big time to change the world.
If i find out who these assholes are...
6742 2018-06-29 23:54:48 We recommend our Jamaican Black Castor Oil Head To Toe Restoration or our 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave In Treatment.
6743 2018-06-29 23:54:47 Another problem is crude palm oil
6744 2018-06-29 23:54:38 Natural resources are important to an economy. But not all the countries that I listed have oil. Each country prosper's under good management of resources. Socialism, is like too many cooks in the soup. An Elite Class will develop, no more socialism.
6745 2018-06-29 23:54:38 I heard that you need to put tea tree oil with another carrier oil (like argan oil or jojoba or almond) cause it’s so strong. Have heard good things about it tho. I’ve never tried cetaphil but my old roommate loved it & she has sensitive skin too
6746 2018-06-29 23:54:35 THEY'RE SOOOOO CUTE! AND YOU'RE RASING EM RIGHT! REP THE OIL KID.
6747 2018-06-29 23:54:35 The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo either keeps on protecting the ‘Unesco World Heritage Sites’, or does something to reduce poverty and bring prosperity to its people by exploring to find and extract oil from its soil. Choice is theirs. @RDCJosephKabila
6748 2018-06-29 23:54:17 I burned my face and eyes with hot oil at work today. I am in so much pain. :c
6749 2018-06-29 23:54:16 Parang bago ‘to. Nag change oil ka ba?
6750 2018-06-29 23:54:16 Me as a teen: I can’t wait to be an adult and no more pimples

Me, now an adult: I got hella pimps and America has went to war for less oil then is currently on my face
6751 2018-06-29 23:54:14 It's a public secret that oil companies are secretly threatening people who are trying big time to change the world.
If i find out who these assholes are...
6752 2018-06-29 23:54:12 Prolly not it sounds like they’re grinding prolly need oil or new ones tbh idk
6753 2018-06-29 23:54:11 Raw sugar, coffee grains (un-brewed), & olive oil. Mix together. Scrub on legs. Set for 10 mins and rinse off.
6754 2018-06-29 23:54:03 demi apaaaah habis baca soal face oil tau tau udah nangkring avocado dan sweet almond oil di keranjang 
6755 2018-06-29 23:53:53 In the end when all the canopies of the dense forest disappear, the gorillas become extinct and water sources poisonous...will man drink oil? We must resist every attempt to drill oil there!
6756 2018-06-29 23:53:52 As has hard #Brexit "visionaries" #Legatum's Christopher Chandler...

"Distressed sectors, transition economies, where normal metrics don't apply" i.e. Russia in 94 where Chandler made fortunes as the biggest foreign investor in Russian state(?) gas and oil behemoth, Gazprom.
6757 2018-06-29 23:53:48 رحنا وماشفنا شي من الاكل كله ينطبخ ب pork oil (زيت خنزير).

6758 2018-06-29 23:53:34 Hard not to just keep buying $DNR on every pullback. Oil ripping, free money.

6763 2018-06-29 23:53:13 It took less than ten years for Chavez then Maduro to destroy oil rich #Venezuela. No way!
6764 2018-06-29 23:53:06 that's why you throw olive oil on them, so you can't tell ;)
6765 2018-06-29 23:52:41 Mine is a side affect from my birth control I’m about to hop on the Castro oil and horse shampoo wave
6766 2018-06-29 23:52:28 Methinks you've completely misunderstood my meaning.  Your phrasing, not your intent to defend yourself, is what I am speaking about.  I carry myself.  I'm just trying to save some judicial headache should it ever come up.
6767 2018-06-29 23:52:20 Just look at those glorious clip-on wheels! And that backpack? Well, someone has to bring along some tasty energy snacks and cans of hi-octane oil, right?
6768 2018-06-29 23:51:44 Robert, our outdoor power equipment return dates start at the time of delivery or pickup from the store. You are well within your return period if you still have your receipt. Keep in mind we cannot accept returns with gas or oil in them.
6769 2018-06-29 23:51:32 Dear taxi driver.  You talk too fucking much.  I do not want to defend the oil industry or Donald Trump right now.

6772 2018-06-29 23:50:37 You probably left it on too long, or perhaps they were too tight. After 4 weeks, if I don’t take the braids out my edges come off. Apply the vapour rub and massage the spot, leave on for a minimum of 15 minutes before washing. Apply peppermint or J. Castor oil everyother day.
6773 2018-06-29 23:50:25 did not plan on getting an oil change today but my light says otherwise

6776 2018-06-29 23:50:00 Small geographical share of oil revenues but still manage to square the books what do you think with all our receiots and 80% of oil and gas revenues.try to keep up.
6777 2018-06-29 23:49:51 Yeah I use it too, the baby oil one leaves your legs smooooooth
6778 2018-06-29 23:49:25 So many cliffs we are racing towards in this state. The Tulare Basin is seriously showcasing the dangers of mining both water & oil with no regard to humans or environment.
6779 2018-06-29 23:49:18 Blacklight Research: "Annual global oil demand growth is now running above two million barrels a day, according to our calculations. That’s 35% higher than the trailing five-year average. More than half of this growth is coming from the United States."

6783 2018-06-29 23:48:36 ...not complaining of the fact that we are a huge population and oil money cannot go around! Think of us and not how to dig deeper into the wealth of he Nigerian government.  We the people are not going anywhere - help us #nigeria #lagos #Plateau
6784 2018-06-29 23:48:24 Straight white bros saying it won't be so bad comes from a position of privilege. Even if Hillary had won, things would still be pretty shitty for people without those privileges, yet she wouldn't be worried. Turns out she's the daughter of an oil exec and another rich person.
6785 2018-06-29 23:48:17 Argon oil works wonders. How often are you shampooing and conditioning? You might want alternate it up.
6786 2018-06-29 23:48:16 We have 30 trillion US in oil reserves
How about we become the cheapest energy cost nation in the western hemisphere
Oh I forgot.
Carbon Taxes.
What a bunch of socialist liberal pussies we are 
Oh yeah . A jam embargo will save us.
A curse that USA maple syrup
6787 2018-06-29 23:48:10 See Baba? And I would take a lukewarm bath with lavender or peppermint oil in it. Or a bankin soda bath also. You need to draw out the virus
6788 2018-06-29 23:48:10 It’s like calling littering and negligent oil spills in the ocean the same thing . Both bad but different
6789 2018-06-29 23:48:01 I think we are going back to oil lamps.

6795 2018-06-29 23:46:34 Eastern Canada, that pressure you feel on your auto sector because of Trump tariffs, is what AB and SK have felt for years with their oil industry. #cdnpoli #ableg
6796 2018-06-29 23:46:15 How is he doing that? Sanctions on Iran reducing the oil supply? Supply goes down….prices go up. Let me help you with basic economics.
6797 2018-06-29 23:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, and illegal immigration.

6803 2018-06-29 23:45:37 I got SCREWED!!!  Now the inflation has already eaten up the tax cuts with oil prices alone.  Good work.
6804 2018-06-29 23:45:25 Oh no!  Have you tried peppermint oil?
6805 2018-06-29 23:45:12 Men these days don’t know shit. They can’t change oil, fight, fix a sink.. or nothing. All these men know how to do nowadays is do drugs and cry
6806 2018-06-29 23:45:10 No, use oil, but not in the pan, on the steak.  Thin layer.  Then salt the shit out of it.  Sear quickly high heat, then lower.  Add 3 tbs butter. Add crushed garlic and sprig if rosemary. Tilt pan and spoon butter over steak repeatedly until done.

He keeps stuffing money in Russia's pocket. He surrendered Syria to Russia. Opened up oil opportunities for Russia sob
6819 2018-06-29 23:42:58 Hey @mrlube ... went for a oil change today. Had a coupon for 2 free movie tickets and I didn’t receive them because apparently they didn’t have any left. Not good enough. #YEG
6820 2018-06-29 23:42:51 Well, In keeping with all the manipulations, market makers will make sure oil falls if dollar falls
6821 2018-06-29 23:42:36 grrrr i need an oil change 
6822 2018-06-29 23:42:30 I put so much body oil, I can’t walk correctly cus my feet keep sliding off my sandals!
6823 2018-06-29 23:42:21 Give the locals jobs. Not menial but professional jobs. The Turkanas will bear the brunt of environmental degradation and the effect of oil extraction. Brushing the locals off is what led to Ogoni rebellion, etc.
6824 2018-06-29 23:42:19 God, I hate the smell of patchouli oil. Lived in the mountains of Colorado for many years and the hippies all used it. Disgusting

6831 2018-06-29 23:41:28 It's a combination of factors Jim.  Especially given the common issues among so many Vets (PTSD, exposure to harmful environments, chemicals, etc.) are dealing with.  We have a generation of folks who spent months exposed to defoliants, oil fires, etc., because of their service.
6832 2018-06-29 23:41:22 My curls are on a different level that’s for sure I’m not sure which level do you have any good recommendations for something I can put in my hair every day with the same castor oil element because I realized if I don’t put something in my hair every day it’s dry 
6833 2018-06-29 23:41:19 I literally have put all fluids in my car this week while Dave is out of town power steering, oil and now water

6843 2018-06-29 23:40:00 What an idiot, he doesn't realize the Putin crap is all about boosting the price of oil and collecting on the winnings for our hedge fund aristocracy.
6844 2018-06-29 23:39:08 the most important thing is to never lose your reasoning. Enjoy all the marvels of the world but never forget the drops of oil on the spoon. BE ONE WITH YOUR DESTINY. CREATE YOUR OWN FATE. WE HAVE BEEN HANDED ALL THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED. NOW IT'S UP TO US.
6845 2018-06-29 23:38:58 You’re going to start saying the drop in oil price was a conspiracy to hurt socialism aren’t you.
6846 2018-06-29 23:38:30 
6847 2018-06-29 23:38:22 It’s so easy to be enchanted by the clown show that is the United States; but as a Canadian, I feel like we should be watching @JustinTrudeau more closely. We don’t need oil pipelines. We need reconciliation. But idk lol I’m a noob at politics 
6848 2018-06-29 23:38:19 Higher gas prices are good. When oil goes under a certain $/barrel, fracking is no longer profitable. I lost my last job when oil went under $42/barrel bc my plant supported the US oil industry. #TheMoreYouKnow
6849 2018-06-29 23:38:15 I know it seems ridiculous, but there's enough precedence for it to be a legitimate concern.
6850 2018-06-29 23:38:07 I’m starting to see the benefits of drinking my coffee black with coconut oil and cinnamon and skipping breakfast.

6854 2018-06-29 23:37:30 There is no logical link there. You CAN'T and WILL NEVER lose weight by  exercising. You lose weight by NOT STUFFING YOUR FACE AND CREATING A  CALORIE DEFICIT. Exercise for weight loss is fake news, snake oil, FAT LIES.

6859 2018-06-29 23:36:39 Joe joe be trying to lick my deodorant or my hair if I just put oil in it. I wonder if they feed him 
6860 2018-06-29 23:36:18 I don't drink European wine or bland cheeses. I prefer butter to oil.  Better quality & prices outside EU. If we sort out the UK juniper problem for gin. I'm fine.
6861 2018-06-29 23:36:02 Not really.  Bush turned region upside down for oil interest and sent our kids to iraq to die when Afganistan was harboring bin Ladin

6866 2018-06-29 23:35:02 Socotra Islands belong to Somalia not Yemen. Saying "Socotra of Yemen" is same with "Abyssinian Coffee" and "Ilale (Adigrat) Oil". There no Coffee in Abyssinia but in Oromia, Sidama, etc, while Ilale is in Somali region (Ogaden) not Tigray!
6867 2018-06-29 23:34:51 - If you’ve got dry skin, opt for a face oil.
-Be sure to exfoliate your skin at least twice a week, if not every day.
-Stop touching your face throughout the day! Its hard I know.
-Try taking up yoga or another relaxing activity to de-stress yourself on a regular basis.

6873 2018-06-29 23:33:58 This castor oil  has my hair looking amazing
6874 2018-06-29 23:33:48 Research face cream. Just wrong
6875 2018-06-29 23:33:44 if i have menthyl oil on benjamin wont play with me ;;-;;
6876 2018-06-29 23:33:32 then there was that huge oil spill a month or two later, and everyone forgot about
fast and furious.
6877 2018-06-29 23:33:28 We use your technique...mostly. We add an extra yoke for every two eggs. And half truffle oil/half butter. We go low and slow for creamy dreamy.
6878 2018-06-29 23:33:27 Okay so I’m considering doing my first fanart video tonight as a “Fanart Friday” thing.....But I’ve been waiting on an oil change for nearly 4 hours so IDK if I’ll even have time when I get home. 
6879 2018-06-29 23:32:28 Ummm. You’re no oil painting Dean. 
6880 2018-06-29 23:32:10 So if you want the #oil to behave....remember it is #roses and pink....and who shall we have round to dinner? I fancy a #Legion and a #Lilith to play...Goodnight.
6881 2018-06-29 23:32:08 As long as #China Okeys Petro-dollar, America sees no problem with the China`s oil and gas project in #OgadenBasin.Thanks to #US policy towards Somali nation in #Occupied_Ogaden.
6882 2018-06-29 23:32:00 Because the imperial US was undermining glorious socialism! Sure the economy wasn’t growing and the oil boom just fattened government employees wallets rather than the average Venezuelan, but it’s how the revolution made Venezuelans feels that counts.
6883 2018-06-29 23:31:58 Nothing and I mean nothing pisses me off more than ordering Chinese food and telling them to bring me hot chili oil AND THEM NOT BRINGING IT!

6886 2018-06-29 23:31:24 I visited the US Midwest in 2004 and watched a rake of CMT and it was wall to wall American soldier patriot SUV oil hero patriot American.
6887 2018-06-29 23:31:15 In Psalm 89:20, 27 it says, "I have found David My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him . . . I also shall make him My first-born." (NASB). As you can see, David, who was the last one born in his family, was called the firstborn by God. This is a title of preeminence.
6888 2018-06-29 23:31:05 But dodo without oil, is that one still dodo?  That’s boli na
6889 2018-06-29 23:30:59 I measured the temp and it only increased by a degree (used an immersion blender). Tested my perception 3x with a viscosity cup. 1st the blended was faster, then the reg. oil, and then the reg. oil again, each only slightly. It appears I was wrong.

6891 2018-06-29 23:30:45 Soybean oil!    (JK...don't do it!)
6892 2018-06-29 23:30:39 Nothing like taking a cool shower and lathering yourself with coconut oil after a beautiful day at the beach 
6893 2018-06-29 23:30:34 What's funny though is Bobby nix just talking out of his butt when the oil supposedly had a plan this summer other than draft good.
6894 2018-06-29 23:30:23 1 word. Coconut. Oil.
6895 2018-06-29 23:30:19 Wtf was I thinking when I was younger asking to be an adult?! I got bills to pay, oil changes to make, meetings and work to go to..... I truly did not know wtf I wanted.
6896 2018-06-29 23:30:13 getting oil changed and it,,,, Hot
6897 2018-06-29 23:30:02 CNBC has a conversation with two local Williston, ND businessmen about ND's oil and natural gas industry.
6898 2018-06-29 23:29:59 why does this video look like an oil pastel painting
6899 2018-06-29 23:29:52 Haha, sorry. I just want to send Geoffrey into retirement with a good oil’ fashioned goodbye.

I also didn’t really visit here since I was a kid. This is the least I can do.
6900 2018-06-29 23:29:51 Putin is driving policies & positions Trump is spewing!
Read  'Putin's Plan' to know what's going on & why. Putin wants NATO weak so he can move on Ukraine, Baltics & what were other Soviet satellites. Weakening or breaking up the EU gives Putin economic influence w/ gas & oil!
6901 2018-06-29 23:29:50 Mom comes home with super expensive cleansing oil and hydrating toner and I’m just 
6902 2018-06-29 23:29:28 Start with the article you sent on a salt water spill. Oil is organic made from decomposed plant life and bacteria eats it.  Salt isn't. 

The Romans salted the fields in Carthage for a reason.
6903 2018-06-29 23:29:19 Never had I thought I could stop respecting the office of the POTUS but this clown brings the prestige to the ground. SLEAZY SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
6904 2018-06-29 23:29:02 get one of those mesh things that covers the oil while they’re frying!! saved my skin many a time
6905 2018-06-29 23:29:00 Is Keith hinting at that he's got some "special" oil?
6906 2018-06-29 23:28:52 Any suggestions for how to check that specifically? (no I will not chug canola oil)
6907 2018-06-29 23:28:17 I had forgotten that. It was good for our country...it's a shame that it is now working for big oil under Pruitt. Another serious loss for our country.
6908 2018-06-29 23:28:10 YOU HARNESSED SAN ENERGY IM SO PROUD OF YOU ALSO TTHSISI FUVKIGNGNG OIL SHAMPOO UAING MOISTURIZED SCALP HAVING INTESTINE LOOKING NECK HAVING RAW SPAGHETTI FLABOUR JOINT CRACKING FASHION EXPERIMENTATIONAL BITCH
6909 2018-06-29 23:28:04 Okay...after my quick analysis of the aforementioned device , I came to the realization that the said device uses ‘little or no oil’. Some foods can’t be made without oil, the air fryer only reduces the needed oil by a huge percentage
6910 2018-06-29 23:27:14 White people must be stopped I'm at this food place and this man is eating purple heirloom potatoe chips seasoned with coconut oil
6911 2018-06-29 23:27:06 Now we just need @comcastcares to wake up and add a big boy channel
6912 2018-06-29 23:26:55 Just hope Americans will enjoy their $3000 dollar tv's and their 150,000 dollar cars ....but then you wind be able to afford gas at $10.00 a gallon gas since Canada sells you 40% of your oil ...all thanks to Dotard tRump
6913 2018-06-29 23:26:53 Been to Benghazi a few times and was very close to it 2 weeks ago ,oil was shut down due to fighting there between 2 Libyan factions. Original pipeline contained meter bypasses big racket for years
6914 2018-06-29 23:26:34 
6915 2018-06-29 23:26:29 I put coconut oil on the parts of mine that are dry and it works wonders!!
6916 2018-06-29 23:26:09 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
6917 2018-06-29 23:26:07 I got the same 2% raise I got for the past 3 years which was 45 cents an hour this year. Can't pay mortgage, phone, electricity or oil. Constant shut off notices.
6918 2018-06-29 23:25:57 Y’all getting finessed niggas putting vape oil n shit n the THC pens n tryna get them off #StayWoke lol 
6919 2018-06-29 23:25:38 Tell me why Tristyn is doing my oil change all while talking on the phone to some guy about buying a truck
6920 2018-06-29 23:25:38 Hey Glen I stopped at the crash scene in Moonlight last nite & walked around. Oil stain is on the extreme outside edge of bend, no skid marks at all. Divers southbound cant see that corner until 20+ metres away.  I found strips of shredded tyre thrown 5m south of impact too
6921 2018-06-29 23:25:34 I love the idea too of seeing Kyle back in oil country lol great depth player
6922 2018-06-29 23:25:32 i remember discussing this in a group of friends once. one factor that became immediately apparent was that what makes a back massage ‘good’ varies a ton. it went from ‘carressing application of oil’ to ‘push that elbow halfway through my thorax’.
6923 2018-06-29 23:25:28 I just met a guy who competes in beard competitions, in a unicorn onesey, and owns a beard oil company. #random #layers what did you do today?
6924 2018-06-29 23:25:16 naiwan ko yung katinko liniment oil, baka kailanganin ko 
6925 2018-06-29 23:24:38 You better tell the truth.a wise man once said it takes energy to wait. You will burn  whole lot of oil while waiting.
6926 2018-06-29 23:24:30 Ever since I copped the oil diffuser I e been playing with scents seeing which ones I like and how to pair different ones... tea tree oil and frankincense do not mix.. my apt smell like an old folks home lol
6927 2018-06-29 23:24:28 I usually try and let my body naturally heal when I'm sick but when I get a stomach ache I am such a little BITCH. I will take all the Pepto, use medicated oil, etc.
6928 2018-06-29 23:24:16 Potholes aren’t as dangerous as @ChicagoDOT stripping a road, laying oil, and leaving steel grates sticking out of the road like Mario Kart obstacles without laying asphalt—for weeks.

Or leaving several inches in height difference for disabled & elderly pedestrians.
6929 2018-06-29 23:23:59 Many left their skin in other countries fighting for oil under false pretenses

6932 2018-06-29 23:23:48 the people who invented olive oil are smarter than all of the manhattan project & einstein combined. god bless
6933 2018-06-29 23:23:34 I am praying.  Also might be suggesting CBD oil after seeing the effects on my mom with RA...

6936 2018-06-29 23:22:17 Lol ,just pray u see what u can answer
6937 2018-06-29 23:22:11 I need me a good vapor and some 10000000% weed oil I’m about to go to the smoke shop 
6938 2018-06-29 23:22:07 I've been arguing with republicans who believe the conspiracy theories for 26 years. This is bigger than just Russia. Americans began this. Cultivated it. Grew it into millions of brainwashed followers. Mercer, the Kochs, & the oil industry have funded it for decades.
6939 2018-06-29 23:21:37 She got a oil change, new shoes, a FULL tank, new clothes, a wash and a vac 
6940 2018-06-29 23:21:29 Just like his driving career, he is there for one reason. If last name wasn't Earnhardt he would be changing oil at some Jiffy Lube in the morning.

6942 2018-06-29 23:21:11 exactly. when you take the right proportion of the farm for hemp, you got fuel any diesel engine (incl electric generator) can run on, machines move free of oil, you produce textiles, ropes etc and from "waist" after pressing oil you feed swine etc. would made farmers self-suffic
6943 2018-06-29 23:21:11 They will use the 5,000 or 3,000 to close down Holyrood as they create a state of emergency. Scotland has no political control then. WM creams oil and uses power grab.
6944 2018-06-29 23:21:06 Agree! Hope you can sort us out @bacpr @bhf But how will you deal with food based conundrums like roughly 5-7 × more Sat Fat in olive oil than in a steak - so by doing this you would be in breach of current dogma to cut the Sat Fat you naughty boy 
6945 2018-06-29 23:20:34 Dang! I think i got 2nd degree burn after cooking oil splashed on me upon placing our viand for breakfast on the frying pan.
6946 2018-06-29 23:20:33 I got a free coffee when I got my oil changed and that made me so happy, haha.  It's the little things.
6947 2018-06-29 23:20:28 I need to learn how to change my oil and tires 
6948 2018-06-29 23:20:06 Yo @Sea_BassRL just letting you know @crazeepreacher been burning midnight oil to lay the hammer on you
6949 2018-06-29 23:19:21 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
6950 2018-06-29 23:19:06 That's oligarchs causing hassle in Venezuela also Chavez didn't diversify the economy when the oil business was bombing. As bad as it is now its still a whole lot better when America controlled their oil
6951 2018-06-29 23:19:04 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
6952 2018-06-29 23:19:02 The American economy has weathered the POUTS storm, despite the stock market stumbling and inflation inching up.
As trade wars kick in, the oil price spike and inflation will choke consumer demand. That leads to prod'n cutbacks and layoffs.
Plus, lower tax revenues.

6953 2018-06-29 23:18:56 me: please change my oil

car mechanic: oh my god, how have you been driving around with only 3 wheels? you need another tire

6955 2018-06-29 23:18:31 Taking on oil companies, transition from oil to electric. Battery storage, off the grid power, solar, making life multiplanetary, internet for everyone, automation for driving, neuralink research, openAI etc etc
6956 2018-06-29 23:18:22 And I forgot to say I do my own filters and oil because of your videos. Thanks!
6957 2018-06-29 23:18:19 And after that I guess you want to pass an anti boil in hot oil and a anti tar and feather law. Hey Kamala, no wonder  California has become the laughing stock of the country.....they have no leadership !
6958 2018-06-29 23:17:40 You know it’s about control of oil production, not social democracy Buddy.

Keep up the great work otherwise.

6960 2018-06-29 23:17:20 I borrowed one just like it from a friend. It works very well on all counter sizes with regular effort. You probably just want to oil the hinges for long clipping sessions.
6961 2018-06-29 23:17:16 I’m decently handy and now change my oil and filters. What’s the next thing I should try?
6962 2018-06-29 23:17:02 Eat more salt. Consider getting MCT oil, it will give you energy.
6963 2018-06-29 23:16:48 @kare11 @Jeff: Olive oil is PUNGENT, not bitter.
6964 2018-06-29 23:16:42 LOL.. just will be wearing oil, no clothes and only eating green foods.
6965 2018-06-29 23:16:32 We would have just claimed ownership of Lucas Oil at that point. Irsay would have had two solid drinking buddies, so I don’t think he would have had a problem with it. We’d probably be part owners of the Colts right now if that shot drops

6973 2018-06-29 23:15:11 I have cruets w/ the measurements for different kinds of dressings but I mostly stick w/oil & lemon juice. I invest in good olive oil too.
6974 2018-06-29 23:15:02 If you know anything about anything, you'll know Venezuela is the way it is because of the US and the West fixing oil prices to undercut them. And Williamson doesn't support fascists either - that's the Tories you're thinking of.
6975 2018-06-29 23:14:59 Good luck!!!
6976 2018-06-29 23:14:41 They have plenty of oil wealth too. EU should force these countries to take responsibility.

6981 2018-06-29 23:13:24 “Pandering to big oil” is where the money comes from to pay $16b in transfer payments to QC which is where the Libs get their votes. Or did you think that money came from selling cheese?
6982 2018-06-29 23:12:42 Lol how stupid and biast are you for making such claims, Russia gdp has decreased because of its oil gains, Donald trump is selling weapons at incredible arms russia isn’t even benefiting as much under weaponary selling either in Asia’s influence Russia decrease whereee show meee
6983 2018-06-29 23:12:38 Same plant different strains  hemp has less than .3% thc so it doesn’t make you high but makes the Cbd oil which also has medicinal purposes  for humans and animals along with rope and clothing also hay forage for horses believe it or not
6984 2018-06-29 23:12:24 Why don’t you go visit Pauly NOnuts Manafort in jail?
Kind of strange how he helped elect the Ukrainian President that let Putin walk in & invade the Ukraine, so Putin could get his oil out of the Black Sea. But, Obama blocked it.
6985 2018-06-29 23:12:22 I'll post some charts later. I'm holding $XHB for LT play. $XLE/$XES/$OIH/$FCG are harder. Big question is why are they lagging oil & do they play catch up? No idea. Some stocks like $DVN, $HES, $APA, $APC look promising, but still lagging. $WLL, $ECA, $WTI weaker than I'd like.

6994 2018-06-29 23:10:41 Why did the government of Venezuela give the trump inaugural $500k which is unaccounted for? Y'all wanna drive that country and people into the dirt so you can get your paws on their oil. Don't be coy Mikey you're just as dirty as your boss. We The People see you.

What have you done lately, Joyce?
6999 2018-06-29 23:10:05 I’m going to spend the night blowing my nose and Googling “zinc and CBD oil interactions” so Mike is getting us pizza.  Fair tradeoff. #sicklife
7000 2018-06-29 23:09:56 Hell yeah. Moroccan argan oil in my hair after I clean it is the best and always makes my hair look just a little less frazzled.
7001 2018-06-29 23:09:56 Nope, never gotten oil golem. At least you're original, I'll give you that.
7002 2018-06-29 23:09:17 The ManWhorian Candidate is serving Putin. He ended the Iran deal (for Russian oil). He is trying to weaken NATO, pulling troops out of Germany, for Russia. Trying to weaken the EU, for Putin. Always slow playing the Russian sanctions. The GOP against US democracy, pro Fascists.

7019 2018-06-29 23:05:10 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

7032 2018-06-29 23:03:03 Never thought that you will surrender like this to US and stop buying oil from Iran. Right now India can bargain better and get cheaper oil from Iran or ask US to supply the oil at the same cheaper price.
7033 2018-06-29 23:03:01 Your right Hugh, I can think of one man, if gone that would make the world a better place. I'll give you one guess and it rhymes with poo!
7034 2018-06-29 23:02:49 I pan fry. Salt the bejesus out of it, hot heat, no oil. An iron skillet is best, but almost any pan will do.
7035 2018-06-29 23:02:39 You work in oil and gas?  Why do you hate Earth?
7036 2018-06-29 23:02:19 Simply because international oil price increased dramatically! Think!!!!
7037 2018-06-29 23:02:06 my plan for the day was to workout and get my oil changed and do laundry and instead I took a 3 hour nap and watched tv

7041 2018-06-29 23:01:41 Thoughts on crude oil with the hefty funds increase into August and a decline GDP estimate??
7042 2018-06-29 23:01:22 @McDavidAcuraPlano. I’m very frustrated with the service. Waited 3 hours for an oil change. I had an appointment. Probably won’t come back even though I’ve had them servicing my car since I bought it there
7043 2018-06-29 23:01:17 I reckon this scene would make a great looking oil painting.
7044 2018-06-29 23:01:10 Oh, and sell your soul... For oil money.

7050 2018-06-29 23:00:25 When @ the mercy of health professionals, I remember that I must maintain preventative habits: exercise, homeopathic dental care (oil pulling, flossing, etc), eating clean+drinking water.

Service givers are cold, give minimal info, & send you on a "who takes my insurance"dance.
7051 2018-06-29 23:00:25 We have heard of prices more like $0.026-$0.033 these days in the interior. Frankly, we would be surprised to see prices even this low within the first few years of the regulated market. We expect to be licensed and extracting by the end of 2018, let's talk if you need legal oil
7052 2018-06-29 23:00:18 Oil and gas. Seen companies without warning leave the UK and base elsewhere. But it’s not publicised so clearly it isn’t relevant
7053 2018-06-29 23:00:11 So when I was ohh eight maybe ten hundred I got in a HUGE fight with dad, I made a holy oil flame thrower with plans of a grenade launcher.
Anyways that’s when I met Loki. After I saved him we talked for a long time, I wanted to go back but I got lost.
7054 2018-06-29 23:00:05 "Oi!" She had just finished setting the armor when he picked up a silver cylinder, which contained a bright blue liquid. That happened to be a coolant pump, and they were delicate. So naturally, the oil covered woman snatched it from his hands after getting around him. "No -

7061 2018-06-29 22:59:12 The GDP of Russia is equivalent to Texas.  The spending now is a) focused on high visibility platforms at a cost to Russia’s full spectrum capability and serves to therefore exaggerate the real threat level and b) is unsustainable (especially if oil prices fall further).
7062 2018-06-29 22:59:05 @bukolasaraki Quick one Mr Senate President. 
Will you and your members look into laws that regulates the activities of oil and gas distribution especially tankers 
Also please ask the executive for their plan for railway and pipelines development
Your citizens die daily.

7065 2018-06-29 22:58:04 Entire country moved to the left on economic issues after 2008 financial collapse.  That’s how Trump beat a field of traditional Republicans.  When his snake oil economy proves fraudulent, voters will be looking left for real solutions.  Trickle down Republinomics is dead.

7067 2018-06-29 22:57:41 His strategic patience as foreign policy didn't get much done and he is the king of "kick the can down the road" diplomacy. Do you remember how he handled the BP oil spill in the gulf? Incompetently. Obama was always "one speech away from victory" and one of our worst Presidents.
7068 2018-06-29 22:57:10 Now I have a choice @DIRECTV has gotten way to high for me only kept it because of @mavtv
7069 2018-06-29 22:57:08 Oil, yes. Like we were doing ourselves a favour by plastering one factor 1 coconut oil
7070 2018-06-29 22:57:04 Tell me exactly how you think the world will work if we stopped all oil production tomorrow?
7071 2018-06-29 22:57:01 We can stop increases in CO2 - just stop burning oil, coal, gas and aviation fuel. CO2  and CH4 and other fossil fuel gases do cause climate change - this is accepted by vast majority of scientists. I'm sorry if this inconveniences you - but human induced climate change is real.
7072 2018-06-29 22:56:58 Remembered salt and vegetable oil, but I forgot to add butter when dropping it in the collander, forgot to buy sauce, and bought chicken breast fillets instead of chicken patties
7073 2018-06-29 22:56:50 There is less oil there, like in Yemen. Besides, after “liberating” Iraq, it became a de facto province of Iran. We couldn’t have f**ked that up any worse than we did. A Neoconjob we will paying for over decades.
7074 2018-06-29 22:56:42 Too much spent huffing gun oil, I reckon.

7082 2018-06-29 22:54:02 Hahah no problem! It’s ok to use those paints- just don’t eat it! ( don’t lick your brush!) also for oil, turpentine is toxic. But you can always use oils to thin your paints- like linseed oil and safflower oil!
7083 2018-06-29 22:53:48 M Smith in"The Present" wonders why US hasn't wholly switched frm oil to solar power=end of a fossil fuel.Believes cost of 1 1/2-3tr  wld return w profit in 4 yrs.Contends oil cos. wld still profit.Says we r able to replace bldng materials for houses w plastic=less deforestation.

7140 2018-06-29 22:41:36 I was just reading an investment analysis which is highly bearish on oil prices. Should oil prices turn bearish are you going to give credit to Trump since you are giving his appointment the blame?

7154 2018-06-29 22:39:43 Can almost smell the Oil of Ulay (as it will always be to me) wafting out of the TV... 
7155 2018-06-29 22:39:30 I just sat for two hours plus at Walmart just to get my oil changed... this has got to be the awfullest most responsible thing I’ve done in awhile.

Doesn't Putin get to audit this complete waste of Russia's oil revenue, or is it a bottomless pit?
7157 2018-06-29 22:39:08 Jojoba oil works wonders
7158 2018-06-29 22:39:01 I didn't see you giving handouts to us oil workers. Now that oil is back you sure do want your equalization payments. Screw you , care about us workers . All you have done is Destroy Canada in 3 years. Time to seperate Alberta!
7159 2018-06-29 22:38:53 Hello, has anyone used Cbd oil for pain? Is it helpful?
7160 2018-06-29 22:38:51 don’t know if i’ve ever eaten at that one but the chicken on the sandwiches at the largo one are absolutely smaller than normal, and last night the fry oil was old and tasted gross as hell
7161 2018-06-29 22:38:47 I’m going to have to be a lot more careful putting oil in my car from now on.
7162 2018-06-29 22:38:44 My Bro in law. A Sunderland man  STRONGLY supposts Indy. Has worked in oil industry  40 yrs knows the truth about our Oil. Don't mention J Murphy to him! lol :D

7165 2018-06-29 22:38:19 Claim nya sih gitu. Tapi gue pake sekali with 12% developer oke2 aja sih, wise aja pilih catnya. Jangan pake miranda kalo ga mau kering. Dan jangan lupa juga sedia vitamin oil sehabis dying rambut.
7166 2018-06-29 22:37:59 Oil is not immune and the oil prices crash ended up damaging the Canadian and Alberta economies and caused thousands of job lay offs. Tech industry also doesn't cause damage to the environment like a bitumen tar sands spill. #cdnpoli #StopKM #KeepItInTheGround #NoPipelines
7167 2018-06-29 22:37:29 US already has NE Syria for that 25% of the land and 70% of oil gas grains and water there

7169 2018-06-29 22:36:52 the christmas tree story is so funny cause it could only happen in college. and texas a&m has all that old oil money
7170 2018-06-29 22:36:45 It's overbought. Now that August Brent Crude expired, that better corrects soon or it will crash worse later on.

7178 2018-06-29 22:35:28 Soon we will eat money and drink oil , Only then we will realized that we are deeply fucked.
7179 2018-06-29 22:35:19 Got that gasoline/oil industry money!
7180 2018-06-29 22:35:16 Right after we discover oil huh? Typical
7181 2018-06-29 22:35:14 -some good lotions, oils , butters etc to try are...
-cocoa butter
-african shea butter
-coconut oil
-cocoa butter gel
-baby oil
7182 2018-06-29 22:35:13 Cook in a leaf oil in a cup
7183 2018-06-29 22:35:10 Oil 
7184 2018-06-29 22:34:38 A lot of fast food places use sunflower oil, I think in n out and chipotle are two off the top of my head.
7185 2018-06-29 22:34:27 I’m actually pretty damn proud of myself right now. I’ve attempted to deep clean our shower since we moved in & monthly since then. I always used some sort of bleach product & nothing ever worked. I just tried white vinegar, dawn soap & essential oil.. holy shit
7186 2018-06-29 22:34:25 I gotta do that... Well except for the nails.  What's cbd oil, for vaping?
7187 2018-06-29 22:34:06 The problem is that our data has become the oil of this era. They call people resource because that's how they see them. Something that can be used.
7188 2018-06-29 22:33:45 I just remembered I had a dream I bought rosehip oil......
7189 2018-06-29 22:33:44 Jack Sprat's mortal enemy.
7190 2018-06-29 22:33:19 Just continue wearing it in protective styles cuz you gon get tired of having to take care of it everyday but if anything you could wash it once a week, get olive oil as tu aceite & find a great shampoo & conditioner to wash & allat get a leave in conditioner too
7191 2018-06-29 22:33:09 I wash every day if I can tho cause I'm just using water so it doesn't strip my hair it just helps move the excess oil along its way
7192 2018-06-29 22:32:43 The process is outmoded not the resource. It’s like says oil is outdated because we have nuclear power. He should look up clean coal then plants.
7193 2018-06-29 22:32:39 This will compound as water cut goes up and we get into wetter their II rocks. Water always a problem due to visc it always out runs oil to wellbore
7194 2018-06-29 22:32:35 @JENNIWOWW tell me why tf did you put water in the cooking oil!!? Ayyyy mujer!  #WatchingTheShowAGAIN  #JSFamillyVacation
7195 2018-06-29 22:32:31 Try castile soap and coconut oil. Also, the flash sale at Macy's
7196 2018-06-29 22:32:16 Our goats are feeling very sorry for themselves. But on the mend I think. 
Rennet and tea plus vodka and oil, baking soda and vitamin c.
7197 2018-06-29 22:32:11 We have an upcoming generation embracing socialism, oblivious to history, Cuba, VZ. Charmed by self serving politicians like Sanders who sell snake oil. A global society that devalues life (Eire). A growing dependency on gov't checks.  And Kelly is keeping us from the abyss?
7198 2018-06-29 22:32:06 No, it’s an infused oil- in m making some calendula cream for my hosts! Nice to have some reliable 
7199 2018-06-29 22:32:02 Keep an eye out for a new video coming soon, a video on how to oil your bat. oiling my @SalixBats AJK players bat in this one, head over to their site to buy yours! #cricket #gun #bespoke #players

7202 2018-06-29 22:31:35 Popped a full blow lamp canister one in an incinerator at the bottom of the garden once when I was about 13... well an old oil barrel bonfire effort anyway... yeah, that big mushroom flame/cloud as high as a house they get on films... yep, that 
7203 2018-06-29 22:31:34 You mean sit around the White House?
7204 2018-06-29 22:31:33 Honestly if I didn’t have my de-stress essential oil roll on on me at all times I’m not sure WHAT I would do.
7205 2018-06-29 22:31:28 Do you keep your coconut oil in the fridge?
7206 2018-06-29 22:31:06 yeah oil is reeeeeally tricky, acrylic is kinda simpler to work with in that sense
you shall try oil someday tho!
7207 2018-06-29 22:31:02 Nah, that is just a mere denial and main cause of misery despite lot of money due to oil
7208 2018-06-29 22:30:44 I like to re-fry mine in a pan. Put a little oil in there and cook over low-medium heat until crispy again. Constantly flip them so they don't burn.
7209 2018-06-29 22:30:25 I just want to know why the oil and gas corporations get $2.3 billion to reduce methane emissions they shouldn't be releasing in the first place, while children's services gets only $4 million to help indigenous families stay together. @RachelNotley ? #ableg #abpoli @Pembina
7210 2018-06-29 22:30:14 Its all accusations where is your proof? Court order etc. stop sending me the freaking news ;) look  what Bilal Erdogan says, he said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was profiting from the sale of ISIS oil. “If you follow ISIS oil, you will find Assad.”  ;)
7211 2018-06-29 22:30:07 He gives us reasons on the daily to hate on him and if you haven't been swayed to join the ranks it means that you're either a lemming or somehow profiting from his snake oil smarminess
7212 2018-06-29 22:30:04 They must come from a long line of phony Christians, selling snake oil and salvation to credulous settlers.
7213 2018-06-29 22:30:03 Yes that may be true however you (we) are up against a snake oil salesman and he has the microphone..
7214 2018-06-29 22:30:00 Also, it must be hot because my coconut oil is now liquid.
7215 2018-06-29 22:29:51 You belong to a Koch-sponsored party that is actively trying to destroy public transit and force everyone to drive cars and consume oil. So maybe have the decency to shut up.
7216 2018-06-29 22:28:44 my lil bitch so spoiled i rub her down in oil

7229 2018-06-29 22:25:43 @CERVASJ cervashad an explosion on the guy at terribles over an oil change. Liberals are becoming very aggresive
7230 2018-06-29 22:25:43 Oh I get it.. Hell, why do you think I'm on here screaming from the roof tops all time? I feel just like you, trust me. You continue on too. As my Father would say when I use to bug the crap out of him, The squeaky wheel always gets the oil/or attention. I heard it both ways.

7236 2018-06-29 22:25:03 Mm, made some pizza topped with fresh Campari tomatoes, fresh basil, red onion, and olive oil. A perfect treat on a hot summer day.
7237 2018-06-29 22:24:47 Me thinks the #lotion #emoji might be put to 'moderate' if not 'more than moderate' inappropriate usage. 
But... at least that means no more oil drum when it comes to a certain forms of lubrication. 
7238 2018-06-29 22:24:45 Lavender 
Ingredients: 
-½ cup coconut oil 
-1 tbsp lavender essential oil
-½ cup shea butter 
This is great body butter for first time beauty DIYers. All you have to do is add all of the ingredients into a small pan and heat on a low heat until they are melted together.
7239 2018-06-29 22:24:42 Breezin12  MMMmmm....MINX, I'd love to stuff my face between those legs of yours and spread your Vulva, open your lips, get you all nice and wet(I LOVE OIL TOO!!!!)

7244 2018-06-29 22:24:30 I believe he’s now a baby oil salesman.
7245 2018-06-29 22:24:22 and they only started the oil fund in the 90s tae , for pensions , and have dipped into once in 2016 , and only then the interest.
7246 2018-06-29 22:24:17 Hoes can be hoes but damn bitch, DAILY? You ain’t tired? Ya p*ssy ain’t dry? When’s the last time you had an oil change on that thang
7247 2018-06-29 22:23:20 She also said I had a maintenance warranty so I was thinking why did I just pay for an oil change then? 
7248 2018-06-29 22:23:03 my oil pen has become my best friend
7249 2018-06-29 22:23:00 maybe he should take some of your snake oil supplements to make him become more of a man like you, Alex. You know, crazy as shit and overly paranoid.
7250 2018-06-29 22:22:57 Really?

7253 2018-06-29 22:22:31 Orange  
Ingredients: 
-Zest of 1 orange 
-1 cup coconut oil 
-2 tbsp honey 
-4 drops orange essential oil 
-Pretty glass jar 
Melt coconut oil in the microwave & add each ingredient & stir it thoroughly. Pour into a jar & wait for it to become solid. Then mix it to a butter
7254 2018-06-29 22:22:29 It does, I wear it for that reason too. It separates the water from the product so that the hairs are “glued” in place kinda. But I’d suggest putting olive oil on your edges after laying it with gel, edge control type ppl should be fine.
7255 2018-06-29 22:21:37 if anyone thinks they had a bad day just know that my friends put an “I  penis” magnet on my car without me knowing and I took it to a dealership to get my oil changed.

7260 2018-06-29 22:20:50 My little dude recently hurt his back 4 weeks ago from jumping off the bed. It broke my heart to see him in pain and unable to be himself. Been giving him cbd oil & with crate rest he’s starting to walk again. Give Brix lots of love  he feels it, it heals.
7261 2018-06-29 22:20:34 Try a cocoa butter shampoo/she's butter shampoo or coconut oil is really good too at moisturizing dry skin.

7264 2018-06-29 22:20:09 Aye it's a shame for him but I'm sure he'll excel at wherever he ends up. Just so long as he remembers to put baby oil on his gloves when he plays against us #lufc
7265 2018-06-29 22:20:04 These last 30 mins of my mate leaving my house have been a series of unfortunate events. Like the bathroom was covered in coconut oil from shaving my legs and taking my makeup off. Then the fucking metal clogged for the sink didn’t wanna come out so I had to get scissors toget it
7266 2018-06-29 22:19:22 No there not. And most of those 'scientist' r being paid handsomely by the oil & gas industry.

It's a travesty.

7272 2018-06-29 22:17:46 I went to Bristol, I bought the van at 2 years old. Took It there after I bought it. Then after I realised I was going through oil and ask them to check it and then they tell me the bad news. This was in March this year.
7273 2018-06-29 22:17:43 Girl all I drink is water nothing better than some H2O I’ve heard of witch hazel I’m def going to get some I’ve heard a lot of great things about it. And I totally forgot about Teatree oil that shit is AMAZING! THANK YOU MAMAS
7274 2018-06-29 22:17:43 I guess but that'd be like comparing Armageddon to There Will Be Blood because they're both about shitty fathers in the oil business.
7275 2018-06-29 22:17:25 Yep it is and will go up in seconds become is made with so much oil really bad idea to mix fire with it
7276 2018-06-29 22:17:06 "reverse funnel" .......ugh
7277 2018-06-29 22:17:05 This oil change is taking too long 
7278 2018-06-29 22:17:05 Except the tech industry doesn't rely on market prices and has high security. Oil is a commodity that is reliant on world market prices. When they prices tanked it affected the economies of Canada and Alberta. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #KeepItInTheGround #NoPipelines

7280 2018-06-29 22:16:45 How does the president of the United States have any control over gas prices has ever done was released a national Reserve bring prices down but it's all about the oil companies not about Trump he doesn't have stock like with the bushehr Cheney had stocking Oil Business
7281 2018-06-29 22:16:45 Another recent concern for Permian shale oil wells is that many are getting sour. This will also increase lifting costs.
7282 2018-06-29 22:16:40 No, I supported the "attack" on Assad. but he has basically ceded Syria to the Russians. The ending of Iran sanctions aids Russia and Assad, but really it was to increase the price of oil which Russia desperately needs. Always warned Assad of the bombings so as not to anger Putin
7283 2018-06-29 22:16:36 Bio oil. Scar gel by derma-e. Vitamin c serums. Clinique’s pep start eye cream has caffeine for dark circles and puffiness
7284 2018-06-29 22:16:25 and those taxpayers who knew better will pay too. This man is proving to be incompetent with no understanding of anything except branding. Cant even run a real business, just promotes a name like a snake oil salesman.
7285 2018-06-29 22:16:21 Baby oil, mario badescu spray, and cetaphil face cleanser are the holy trinity to Sophia’s clear skin
7286 2018-06-29 22:16:21 The existing supplies would be bought up real quick by the same group who has the bulk of the paper money/real estate, diamonds, oil, etc. Good will has little value; false promises of performance is fuel for the competitive deception that masks the root causes of the bankruptcy.
7287 2018-06-29 22:16:10 Clean hair cut plus an oil change ?? TODAY AND TOMORROW OFF?? Bro.. SEND ME THE ADDYS!!
7288 2018-06-29 22:16:05 I wonder how many times I can excuse myself to hit this oil b4 it becomes suspicious

7293 2018-06-29 22:15:36 I used CBD for 8 weeks and here’s my opinion:

CBD Oil for recovery as a fitness enthusiast/athlete < sleep, recovery modalities, and proper nutrition.

Save yourself the money, or spend it on actual weed and have more fun.

7298 2018-06-29 22:15:10 New business idea: Just Fucking Oil Changes And Tire Rotations. 

No 30 point inspections/fishing expeditions. Just fucking oil changes and tire rotations. Exactly as advertised.
7299 2018-06-29 22:15:05 I can't wait to get drunk and remind my neighbors why they hate me.
7300 2018-06-29 22:15:05 It was one that was sent to me in the mail for an oil change for $22.95 and she tried saying I couldn’t use it b/c my car takes synthetic but my car actually takes conventional lmao it was the last year that they made the legacy w/ non synthetic
7301 2018-06-29 22:14:47 All the oil revenue! Surely Trump is heavily invested in/indebted to Rosneft.

7303 2018-06-29 22:14:44 Not Kenney saying “destructive”.  Kenney swearing “a rebound, regardless of oil price, could never happen under the “destructive” NDP govt”.  Just curious...that would be a silly thing to say, since it’s the price of oil—and not government—that drives “rebounds”.

7313 2018-06-29 22:13:10 Can these be bought to support the family?
7314 2018-06-29 22:13:05 Well, OK, but my all time favourite was from the branch office's "elder statesman". 
"But where will the money for an oil fund come from?". And even better, his puzzled expression when everyone collapsed in tears of laughter!
7315 2018-06-29 22:13:01 Actually  you import 80 percent of the oil you use and try to attack is we still have allies England Japan the EU not one nation will aid you if you attack us
7316 2018-06-29 22:12:38 Then what? They masterminded the disapearance of their own citizen, Nnamdi Kanu for his determination to do something about this genocide. What do they care? One Nigeria where oil flows directly to them or they go broke.
7317 2018-06-29 22:12:22 $CL_F #BakerHughes reported that the number of U.S. rigs drilling for oil declined by four to 858 this week. $USO $UCO #crudeoil
7318 2018-06-29 22:12:22 The sociopaths who run corporations and the banking cartels don't care.
The huge corporate manufacturers of weapons aren't concerned about the casualties of wars in foreign countries.
And when wars increase the price of Oil, the Oil corporations are happy too.
Socio-psychopathy
7319 2018-06-29 22:12:17 I wish if my family were like this

7321 2018-06-29 22:12:05 The temerity of Japan to object to CCP Oil drilling in CCP claimed territory! What next? CCP China has claimed (part?) South China Sea as its own. It is not the end of CCP creep into the region. It is only the beginning. Time has shown that & no-one offers strong resistance.

7329 2018-06-29 22:11:22 @marty_walsh a nation without borders is not a nation you bozo. How’s the open border situation working in Europe? How’s socialism working in oil rich Venezuela? Tax and spend and a government regulated country does not work. Stay out of my wallet.
7330 2018-06-29 22:11:16 The only positive thing about trump is the reveal of how a foreign government and a snake oil salesman and gerrymandering can destroy what was a great nation.
7331 2018-06-29 22:11:13 I need to recover from this $125 oil change 
7332 2018-06-29 22:11:06 Treated my new perm to a coconut oil condition tonight. Small sections, saturated it in coconut oil (@superdrug for hair and skin) then left it for 20 mins.

7333 2018-06-29 22:11:00 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
7334 2018-06-29 22:10:56 I do hope you are right, Terri, but I fear there will be not a single pipeline built in Canada so long as the Liberals rule in Ottawa, and the NDP rule in Alberta and BC. I 100% support Alberta Oil and Gas. Those parties do not.

7338 2018-06-29 22:10:42 That's going to happen with or without the American military there. The amount of international interest in that region is due to the majority of the world's oil comes from there and it makes most countries nervous not just US to leave it in the hands of Islamic extremists
7339 2018-06-29 22:10:40 just put a k&n oil filter in my car who wants to race
7340 2018-06-29 22:10:37 Coconut oil is good for dry scalps my mum n sister use it an they have very bad dry scalp conditions
7341 2018-06-29 22:10:06 yeah there's no reason to drill for oil offshore or make your workplace smell like a fruity fog machine

7345 2018-06-29 22:08:52 I apologize Hersh. That was not intentional.
There are most likely oil companies fracking close to your home .You ok with that ? Have you been to Ft Mac ? Do you honestly believe that our crude is the worst kind of environment injustice? What do you better ?

7348 2018-06-29 22:08:31 Drinking Stella Rose wine out of one of those handmade Mexican clay mugs u buy at the border. Let's see how it clashes with this Gelato Brass Knuckles oil.
7349 2018-06-29 22:08:17 Wow. I voted life without parole. Hang them? Do another one & add boiled in oil & burned at the stake. I'm interested to see what people say.
7350 2018-06-29 22:08:15 Makes sense.  They’ve tripled the amount of wells (in-fill) in their on-shore maturing fields to produce the same amount of oil.  Even super giant fields have their limits.  Do the math.  Av. Decline rate of 2.5% over 30+ years.  Something’s got to give eventually.

7354 2018-06-29 22:07:39 that is great! Where do you get your oil change?

Pretty sure he was in the room. Also seems to me a short time after that Hendricks also intimated he was an issue
7359 2018-06-29 22:06:39 #BreakingNews Last week, BP spilled 136,000 litres of toxic mud off the coast of Nova Scotia during an exploratory test. This after the federal government approved BP to drill seven of the deepest offshore oil wells ever, citing their "confidence" in the safety of the project.

You have a propensity for violent solutions to problems (eg. blowing up Ecuador's London embassy + martyring oil execs family members). We don't agree on problem solving approaches and other matters. 
Respectfully,

7363 2018-06-29 22:05:49 Oil is up. Watch Alberta as oil climbs in value. Will the people come back or will we continue our dependance on oil & gas? #abndp
7364 2018-06-29 22:05:35 This is your positive case for the Union?
You need to do some homework on that one and according to WM they are looking for super Dooper trading deals post Brexit.
So they won't be wanting our oil, electricity, water, whisky etc etc etc?

I wouldn't tell someone to have more MUFA, i'd tell them more olive oil. So why aren't our guidelines like this?

7374 2018-06-29 22:04:24 No. Oil is priced in dollars so India has to devalue its currency and export so the RBI can maintain a dollar reserve. With another Persian Gulf War on the horizon, Iran sanctions, and Saudi's lifting price controls on exports, India has no choice but to devalue.

7381 2018-06-29 22:02:43 Here's an idea @jkenney... why don't you tell us how you would have balanced the Alberta budget when oil (WCS) was trading as low as $16.30/ barrel per month? You couldn't even balance the federal budget when it was trading at $90.97/ barrel per month! #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

7387 2018-06-29 22:01:28 Norway & Scotland discover oil in the  70's. Norway 2018, almost full employment. High salaries. High standard of living. 1st class social care and infrastructure. Huge economic surplus and $1 trillion pension fund.
UK 2018- Relentless austerity, low pay and £1.7 trillion debt.

7391 2018-06-29 22:01:12 I do an oil treatment when my scalp is super dry. You can use hair specific oils, argon oil, jojoba oil (I use olive oil) and you soak your hair in it and wrap with plastic fir half an hour to overnight before washing out.

7401 2018-06-29 21:58:57 What does the oil have to do with stolen animals?  The same  community is demanding for 10% from the oil proceeds.  Classical example of bad politics.
7402 2018-06-29 21:58:55 Relax, they're not building any pipelines. TM expansion is mothballed indefinitely, Energy East & Northern Gateway are dead. Canada will continue to import foreign oil by tanker - far better than by nasty pipelines from Alberta & Saskatchewan.
7403 2018-06-29 21:58:54 It's crazy how language changes everything. Came to get an oil change and the manager was speaking to a man and rolling his eyes. As soon as the man gave his name the manager realized they spoke the same language. I waited 5 minutes to be attended bc they couldn't stop laughing.

7406 2018-06-29 21:58:29 Ever wonder what oil is? It’s remnants of vegetation decayed over hundreds of millions of years. A product of nature and a storage of CO2. Using it is an organic, natural process whereby humans are putting back some of that stored CO2 of days gone by. It’s not pollution!
7407 2018-06-29 21:58:16 The thread is about the olden days: when supermarkets were rare, we shopped the high street with much less choice, food prices were higher, pies came in tins, lard rather than olive oil, le Piat d’Or for wine and pizza was Italian rarebit.
7408 2018-06-29 21:58:14 – make sure you brush at least 2 times a day, morning and night
– brush your teeth after eating or drinking
– coconut oil pulling 
– lemon or orange peels 
– strawberries and other fruits
7409 2018-06-29 21:58:13 Amazing  so many Canadians are fooled by this incompetent government. We are being sold snake oil from @gmbutts so @JustinTrudeau can get votes from Canadians suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.
7410 2018-06-29 21:58:12 I hate Goodyear I dropped my car off at 8 hours ago for simple oil change and my car still not ready and I gotta drive to Austin in 30 minutes  what the fuckkkk
7411 2018-06-29 21:57:54 The security issue has to be addressed by the government if oil transit as to go on as required
7412 2018-06-29 21:57:52 Sure! And then what about autos? Wheat boards? Oil? Gas? USA sees CDA as divided among provincial interests. Were it not we could threaten turning off spigots and hydro electricity . UNITED WE STAND , DIVIDED WE FALL is an axiom better understood by Trump than we care to face?
7413 2018-06-29 21:57:26 Chevron requested the Constitutional Court of Ecuador to cancel the burden of $9.6 BILLION for killing people, causing health crisis and decimating Amazon. Court has ruled. Findings will be announced in next 7 days. Pence announced $1.5 million to aid Ecuador + wants more oil.
7414 2018-06-29 21:57:17 Hmm I feel like quinoa cooked in veggie broth n cooled w black beans, avocado, lemon/lime n cilantro would b niiiice maybe some kale marinated in olive oil n citrus too n if ur feeling a little nutty, sunflower or pumpkin seeds?
7415 2018-06-29 21:57:17 Watch the games my friend...and find me all the Ryan Reaves types still playing.
7416 2018-06-29 21:57:01 I always wondered what would happen if I went to hospital in full drag and what solvent they’d use to dissolve all my grease paint. I doubt the NHS has much coconut oil laying about.
7417 2018-06-29 21:56:54 I’ve heard baby oil works really well too.
7418 2018-06-29 21:56:54 We love that you're going above and beyond to show people the effectiveness of Proactiv! We hope the mask is doing its job of absorbing excess oil while soothing, conditioning, and nourishing the skin. 
7419 2018-06-29 21:56:47 @realDonaldTrump @potus @VP @trish_regan @FLOTUS President Trump Please Help! OPEC is taking all the money you gave us in our gas tanks! Please get oil prices down to 50 per barrel! Anything higher is a lie! It's hurting us
7420 2018-06-29 21:56:43 Do people know Russia is the number two oil exporting country in the word?  I know people are afraid of the middle east, but are they paying any attention to how dangerous Russia actually is?
7421 2018-06-29 21:56:42 I checked my oil all my myself today. #girlpower
7422 2018-06-29 21:56:40 If you use electricity you use coal.  Much cheaper than oil and natural gas.   Guess Arnold thinks everyone can afford what he can.
7423 2018-06-29 21:56:20 Become good dad and also work on new projects :) as for today just get my car’s oil and filters changed XD
7424 2018-06-29 21:56:13 glad I actually stuck to the promise to myself to clean today. now I need to go wash my car, get an oil change, and go grocery shopping.... and I felt like I wanted to do something else but my peanut brain forgot I guess,
7425 2018-06-29 21:56:07 Back in the day eveyrthing was real in Zim,from Music to Tea to Sugar to Margarine to cooking oil even Zim pussy was tasty not nowadays!
7426 2018-06-29 21:56:01 Getting my oil changed and the waiting area doesn’t have air conditioning , I’m going to die bye

7434 2018-06-29 21:54:37 I’m more of a fan of non-essential oils like 10w30 and Castor oil... they don’t taste nearly as good but my inner is just as at peace.
7435 2018-06-29 21:54:29 Oil changes always come at the worst times smh
7436 2018-06-29 21:54:27 Seems like they are dumping the shorts more than adding to the longs
7437 2018-06-29 21:54:24 I need to do my damn oil change tomorrow...got the oil and filter weeks ago

7444 2018-06-29 21:53:44 "Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling and Ban Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces Amendment"

that is a single ballot measure in florida this november, because they are clearly two related issues and definitely not a blatant attempt to leverage inconvenience to enable drilling.
7445 2018-06-29 21:53:42 If Andy disnae zip it we'll turn off the oil

7446 2018-06-29 21:53:32 Some local shops may do free diagnostic checks, which will tell you which code is triggering the Check Engine light. It could be low oil, it could be a bad O2 sensor.
7447 2018-06-29 21:53:27 So has anybody noticed an uptick of Oil company and now Steel company twitter commercials (promotions)lately? I block them constantly. It like the Republicans are doing all of the advertising on here now. Weird and kinda creepy. @Twitter what’s up with that?
7448 2018-06-29 21:53:15 Regulations to make sure we have clean water..air..food..banks to stop charging outrageous fees..landlords to be able to just kick you out for no reason...oil in our oceans poisoning our fish just to name a few..nursing homes abuse..How is that good for the average American?

7456 2018-06-29 21:52:07 In the 1960s, the Democrats stopped fucking over unions by voting for Taft-Hartley as they did in the 1940s and for Landrum-Griffin in the 1950s. 

Oil interests via New Dealer Lyndon B Johnson funded Dem campaigns in the pre-1960s era.
7457 2018-06-29 21:52:04 Mine has been on for a few weeks now. It could only be a million things. I just checked the oil and other fluids and decided mine wasn't that major. I hope.
7458 2018-06-29 21:52:04 Palestine was desolate and deserted. Melted with malaria and swamps, look around,  at Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan, where are they, and where we are. The oil Gulf states haven't reached tenth of what we have. We turned Israel to paradise, its like a thorn in the eyes of Islam
7459 2018-06-29 21:51:42 Now wait a minute.. lol i didn’t see i can change oil, but I’m sure if i YouTube I’ll be right there and ready to go  lol

7462 2018-06-29 21:51:37 And giving the little bit right back to the oil companies. Thanks fucktard.
7463 2018-06-29 21:51:32 By professional economist analysist Nigeria should have 20$ in excess crude oil sales from the budget bench mark, where are these excess  taken?
7464 2018-06-29 21:51:19 Eat loads of garlic - they hate that stuff - and rub tea tree oil around your face and head. Or indeed rub garlic butter around your face!

Sign the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge!!
7472 2018-06-29 21:50:01 the lady that changed my oil saw my hunter x hunter lanyard and gave me a discount 
7473 2018-06-29 21:49:57 I balanced it out with a dinner of quinoa, edamame/broad/french beans, peas, sugar snap peas and a herb/oil/garlic/maple syrup dressing all made from scratch though. Life is all about balance! 
7474 2018-06-29 21:49:55 Everyday at least one oil field guy asks for my number and 9/10 are married, at least take your dam wedding band off when you ask bro 
7475 2018-06-29 21:49:52 Bitch you not happy I got an oil change 
7476 2018-06-29 21:49:44 I know what your going through... Syringomyelia has affected my life the best medication I found has been CBD oil no THC just the CBD it allows me to keep painting animal portraits
7477 2018-06-29 21:49:41 In terms of production, it's much more, but way fewer are small farmers. Oil companies bought out inventions that should have made fuel cheaper. We had GOOD electric cards in production. Big oil bought them out then bought the rest from those who owned one.

7480 2018-06-29 21:49:28 Eminent domain, they’ve been doing it forever. How do you think the pipeline projects get built? Oil company pays the gov who seizes it under EDomain :(

7482 2018-06-29 21:49:16 Does he realized how many people work in the coal industry. And how many people rely  on coal that cannot use oil ,gas, wind or solar.
7483 2018-06-29 21:49:14 I got an oil change!! Lets party
7484 2018-06-29 21:49:13 exhibiting my unleashed masculinity by blasting kacey musgraves while changing my own oil in the middle of the street
7485 2018-06-29 21:49:06 It's a pretty picture: fighting forest crimes in the "developing" (aka yet to be civilized) world while basing its economy on the very resource that is destroying these forests as well. Norway's economy is 50% North Sea oil roughly, just check.
7486 2018-06-29 21:49:05 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
7487 2018-06-29 21:48:59 Agreed. Tea tree ones are amazing. And the argon oil ones. I get mine from poundland usually or Superdrug. You’ve reminded me I need to get some more 
7488 2018-06-29 21:48:35 I've read the secret Hillary/Cameron emails dividing up the oil in Libya. They are on wikileaks of you go digging. Sarkozy got a cut too.

7490 2018-06-29 21:48:18 Yes fab one, and olive oil...any grease basically. Almond oil is often used in beauty products, but clearly not great if you have a nut allergy!
7491 2018-06-29 21:48:13 my house robots won't stop fucking and I can't get any work done because 
a. the place is messy without them doing the housework
b. there's robot cum (oil) everywhere
and c. have you ever heard what it sounds like when two pots bang together over and over?
7492 2018-06-29 21:48:04 Yes, but lift has costs. Cost that include lifting of water. Over time water increases, increasing costs (lifting, hauling, disposal). No doubt a shale OIL well can produce 20 maybe 30 years. Real question is how long can they produce economically.

7495 2018-06-29 21:47:27 Premier @RachelNotley's swift response to the global collapse in oil prices, prevented thousands and thousands of Albertans from losing their jobs, their savings and their houses. Jason Kenney doesn't have the slightest clue what he's talking about. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

such measures will slow the Growth of the Texas Economy, & potentially jeopardize oil/gas developments in US Energy.
7503 2018-06-29 21:46:00 The ratio of Cow to humans is like 3.5 to 1 in Uruguay.

7506 2018-06-29 21:45:42 Never know when devious minds brainstorm ideas. Why do you think Opec just decided to increase oil production last week? I’m sure we had a lot of input into that decision. I doubt Putin was pleased. Maybe it Gives us some more leverage? China isnt going to help w/ Kim.
7507 2018-06-29 21:45:27 Within 7 minutes today at work I: slipped on oil and destroyed the left side of my body, spilled a milkshake all over myself, and got punched in the eye on accident by my coworker. It is not a great day at Chick-Fil-A!!

7509 2018-06-29 21:45:09 Trump is clearing the way for Putin to reclaim the Baltics and Balkans. Perhaps Turkey as well. Own a land bridge between Europe and ME and warm water routes for world wide oil export.
7510 2018-06-29 21:44:26 Well we supply 40 percent of your oil and the electricity to 1/3rd of your country and we control 40 percent of the world's supply of potash used by farmers and the only land access to alaska all these could be shut off. Also your only ally now is Russia

7521 2018-06-29 21:42:18 I can only imagine how large the congregation will be in that "Land of Oil" church on Sunday.

People will start saying there's power and blessings in the church because of the "prophecy".

Sigh.

7523 2018-06-29 21:42:03 I didn't manage to pipe up at the time, can use coconut oil in balm. Allegedly some health benefits. If nothing else its a different smell/taste to the ones suggested

7526 2018-06-29 21:41:20 It's kind of the musical (for want of a better term) equivalent of root canal surgery. In an oil drum being rolled down a mountain, while being bombed. Oh, and there's a swarm of wasps in the oil drum, too, and they've all just had root canal surgery so aren't very happy.

7530 2018-06-29 21:41:07 All Canada has to do to fix this issue is stop importing oil. They are the US largest source. It’ll hurt our wallets big time but you bet it’ll get everyone to vote those imbeciles out.
7531 2018-06-29 21:40:57 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.

7538 2018-06-29 21:39:45 Why did you cut off the first part of the video where it's all put into context?  Or did you wish to change the context and meaning of what she was saying?  Sounds like yellow journalism.  Unfortunately, your liberal friends will eat this up as gospel, no?  Snake Oil Salesman.
7539 2018-06-29 21:39:38 So you're going to sell off parts of our national parks (that we all own) to oil companies to pay for maintenance? Why not cut that 6b from the military budget which is nearly $1 trillion per year? Way to squander what little us people actually own ya fucks.

7550 2018-06-29 21:38:17 People just keep looking at the scoreboard (price), being stocks, oil, rates, fx, crypto. If you want to win, you gotta see how the game is being played, you gotta know the players, the drivers, the moving parts, mkt psychology. Make a case! Thats how you win!

7559 2018-06-29 21:36:11 Which isn't to say that growing food to save land is a bad use of energy, or that growing trees instead of drilling oil is a bad use of land, just that both are (still) finite so need to be measured against competing uses (esp. wildlife habitat for land).
7560 2018-06-29 21:36:07 Okay my pick, oil and gas. You asked. I appreciate them when it is minus 30.

7564 2018-06-29 21:35:45 I used Moroccan Oil shampoo in my shower. Haven’t spoken a word about it but now it’s in my Instagram ads. This is getting weird, y’all.
7565 2018-06-29 21:35:42 What would they call it if oil had never been discovered?
7566 2018-06-29 21:35:27 I'm lost though, what oil would you use? Around me I have available only olive oil and a plethora of seed oils. Mayonnaise made with olive oil is a whole different thing. I ask but I don't know what the answer could even be.
7567 2018-06-29 21:35:23 I usually hoard things like receipts for work done on my car, even oil changes and such. Apparently the one and only receipt I ended up throwing out was for when I got my A/C compressor replaced last July/August. Guess what part of my car just stopped working again...
7568 2018-06-29 21:35:09 I know a man in Lagos, he's a friend to capital oil CEO. He has trained 5 guys n all are millionaires today. When serving him, you're free to enjoy, flex but don't save his cash. N u will serve him for 9 years, though he will make u wealthy.
7569 2018-06-29 21:35:08 We buy petrol. The people we buy petrol from buy politicians and try to get them elected so they can use our government to fight wars over who gets the oil in the ground. That particular oil field around Cyprus has involved a lot of that.

7578 2018-06-29 21:34:12 Sell oil, not buy oil.
7579 2018-06-29 21:33:56 Why does it take them so long for an oil change... it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
7580 2018-06-29 21:33:55 I assume you have staples i.e. olive oil, spices
Slice cheese, slice carrots lengthwise, slice apples, alternate layers, whisk EVOO with a little bit of your wine for a vinaigrette and drizzle over layers, toss a little dried basil. Et voila a really crappy insalata caprese
7581 2018-06-29 21:33:46 Lol it's amazing that this paid ad is just a string of comments with bad publicity. The oil industry is truly garbage.

7586 2018-06-29 21:33:21 Shipping data from this month indicate that Russia and Saudi Arabia had started to increase their output in advance of the accord...this bump is still short of the 1.8 million barrels removed...expect rising oil prices soon

7589 2018-06-29 21:33:02 Yeah ngl I was using castor oil at night, and then in the morning I would wash it off when I washed my face...one of my brows was hella janky
7590 2018-06-29 21:33:02 What diabolical super-genius came up with this strategy?! Those childishly rendered cartoons will certainly bring Canada's oil & gas industry to its knees.

What next? Giant paper mache puppets?

7592 2018-06-29 21:32:52 OK- so Emirati want to tarnish the images of Qatar and Kuwait- but why?  I thought the Emirati we worried about diversification as they look at the end of their endless supply of oil. I thought they wanted good investments. How did they end up in Trumps bed?
7593 2018-06-29 21:32:50 Viene actuando fenomeno como cobertura. El ADR cerro con un doji semanal y quedo apoyado sobre LT que viene dsd oct17. Sin embargo por 5ta semana consecutiva busca y no logra posicionarse sobre U$S37.50, miraria el oil y tendria cautela, abajo de U$S34.5 empieza a complicarse ...
7594 2018-06-29 21:32:45 There is one simple way how: decrease your oil consumption by alternative engine. Free yourself forever!

7596 2018-06-29 21:32:24 Okay, to clarify: In the combustion chamber. Except early 911s, where the air cools the engine and all the oil is on the ground underneath it.
7597 2018-06-29 21:32:15 Why can't people who want to extract oil be left alone and should be able to do what they are doing? Yes, I do believe in a clean environment and sure, technical responsibility should be taken when extracting oil. Members of Greenpeace are bullies. #Petroleum #Oil
7598 2018-06-29 21:32:14 I disagree, particularly in energy & oil. Canada can live without most of the stuff on this list. How long can the US go without electricity to several states, and oil shortage? Canada is the largest single supplier of oil to the US, so if America refuses to purchase, who hurts?
7599 2018-06-29 21:32:06 This has got Al Sharpton style phony baloney call-a-press-conference snake oil grand standing all over it. An insult to all the martyred who were lynched.
7600 2018-06-29 21:32:00 Coconut oil is rly comedogenic (clogs pores), so be careful using it if you're acne prone! I recommend jojoba bc it's one of the closest oils to what your body actually produces, and helps level out natural oil production.

I thought it would be a bombshell but never heard anything on national news. Anyone have info? Maybe I’m just crazy.

7616 2018-06-29 21:29:37 That’s the trouble. There is no easy solution. People talk about heat pumps a lot, but that are a significant cost, and require upkeep. Oil and wood would be the same I imagine.

7618 2018-06-29 21:29:24 The point is to be careful what you buy.  Using illegal rainforest wood for loo paper/palm oil for food is morally indefensible too.  We share the planet, at this rate we will have no other species to share it with.

7620 2018-06-29 21:29:13 I’m not sure. I think Putin’s main motivations right now are Arctic oil and Crimea. I would however think the Russians could get to him and probably should. I don’t think they can control him.

7623 2018-06-29 21:28:49 It’s honestly resulted in improvement for poor people of Venezuela, or would be if they weren’t being held hostage by 4 or 5 oligarchs who are withholding food to make a political point–not to mention the US big oil interests who are working hard to make Venezuela dysfunctional.
7624 2018-06-29 21:28:46 See u don’t understand we were already in a trade war. & we were loosing. Watch Trump u might learn something. I just saw he has won the war with the oil. The gas prices will b coming down soon.

7627 2018-06-29 21:28:05 I'd get involved in a plot to overthrow my shitty corrupted government that's been ruining my country (which could EASILY be a massive superpower due to it's massive oil reserves and mass appeal) instead of running away and pretending I'm living any better in a different country.

7638 2018-06-29 21:26:26 The majority of Scala jobs aren't purely functional. Anyone selling you "object-functional" or "we're somewhat functional" is snake oil.

In scala, people push "Reactive manifestos" and "Future is an asynchronous monad" and other snake oils, and many companies ate it up.

7645 2018-06-29 21:25:59 Actually more like 35% revs from oil now - but goes up and down with price. What the BOGIT chart shows is the slave dependance on value of ruble to oil price is clearly broken now - although again it is influence FX rate of course

7647 2018-06-29 21:25:34 I would suggest that the work of FRSC should not be on the road alone but should also start from whatsoever place these articulated vehicles ( oil tankers, containers and so on) are known to be taking off from.

7661 2018-06-29 21:24:10 Bit of 2 stroke motor oil would probably be better. Ky has the wrong viscosity & dries into a bogey like consistency under friction.
7662 2018-06-29 21:23:52 Got to be jam first, it's all to do with density of the material. Less dense substance (cream) on top of the more dense one (jam) - bit like oil and water!
7663 2018-06-29 21:23:45 Paul Stamets has been experimenting with using pearl oyster mushrooms to break down land based oil spills by soaking it up with sawdust. Another potential reason for why they'd use them in space, both for food and decontamination :)

7671 2018-06-29 21:23:22 @jiffylube $119 for a oil change, and that doesn't include vacuuming the interior.  It's the little things that keeps customers, its also the little things on why businesses loose customers. #peaceout #cheaperatthedealership
7672 2018-06-29 21:23:16 @SenMikeLee sold his lawyering to the gas & oil industry to cut EPA restrictions like carbon emissions.
He deserves no judicial seat.
7673 2018-06-29 21:23:15 Blessed to be goin back to Oil & Gas. Shit is oi king back up

7675 2018-06-29 21:23:01 Seriously? Salt water more damaging than oil spills? Have you EVER been to the coast? Data for this load is yours to provide.
7676 2018-06-29 21:22:59 I think it'a a two-way street, so to speak. The ex-colonial powers (France more UK) empower Arfican dictatorical regimes and them, on the other hand, exploit the country for their sake AND return the favor to the ex-colonials in oil+privileged contracts+buying weapons etc.

7685 2018-06-29 21:21:44 HOW ABOUT THAT OIL SPILL FLOWING DOWN RIVER?
7686 2018-06-29 21:21:15 Why is that I have to pay $75+ to get my oil changed for my VW yet I can change it myself for half that??? And almost any other car brand is a reasonable price.
7687 2018-06-29 21:21:15 Well said
7688 2018-06-29 21:21:10 Cool, only great things can come from making it easier for oil companies to spend more time on the bottom of the ocean
7689 2018-06-29 21:21:06 I never said not to consume nutrient dense real food. Nor did I say to eat refined carbs and seed oils. We are specifically talk LCHF. You can still not consume refined carbs and seed oil and eat nutrient dense real foods and not be LCHF.
7690 2018-06-29 21:20:56 I'm never going to have to pay for an oil change again. Here I am learning how to do it on my own 
7691 2018-06-29 21:20:50 I wish i had someone to personally rub tanning oil on me so i don’t have to do it, because i absolutely hate it

7711 2018-06-29 21:18:31 Americans don’t seem to realize how much they depend on Canada for energy (electricity), oil, and other very basic commodities. It’s an American fallacy, not knowing enough about your neighbour to the north. Both countries’ economies are very intertwined. We depend on each other.
7712 2018-06-29 21:18:22 Jeremy do you have any information on who will control the cost of medical cannibus?  I have been getting my oil from a grower and producer in Ontario, namely Tweet where the price has remained the same over the 5 year period that I have been on it.

7743 2018-06-29 21:14:58 I'd argue that we have more to fear from Turkey than Russia in the Mediterranean. They aren't really our allies any more - and they are competing with us to get at the oil.

7771 2018-06-29 21:11:05 - Do: wear lots of sunscreen and reapply throughout the day/ every few hours. 
-Don’t: use suntan oil or not apply sunscreen, sunburns are very dangerous and can lead to issues like skin cancer.
7772 2018-06-29 21:10:59 France has just put in a major pipeline to Russia for oil most of the European Union has made massive deals with Russia in the last 7 months so let's be honest about who is our allies. In America Democrat Senators work daily to divide the country4political
7773 2018-06-29 21:10:44 About sunscreen? The “screen” is a bunch of harmful chemicals. A natural alternative is carrot seed oil that has a natural spf of 25-30. Mixed with red seed oil, you have a SPF 40 and no chemicals. And gatorade is nothing but salty sugar water lol
7774 2018-06-29 21:10:40 Well you're trying to make potions, so maybe Alchemists? Or since you're trying to hawk illegitimate medicine, maybe Snake Oil? Bad Medicine could fit too?
7775 2018-06-29 21:10:39 Really sad to hear. Even sadder for me given that my country, Australia, is so tied in with Indonesia. We are probably the country that benefitted most from the destruction of East Timor in the shape of our oil deal with Indonesia.

7779 2018-06-29 21:09:42 My assertive haggler persona broke down today when a new mechanic asked me what kind of oil I'd like in the car I've driven for 10+ yrs, & I said, "Umm, there are different kinds?" 

Mechanic: "Yep, regular & synthetic."

Me: "Hmm, yeah, I don't know. What do you think..." 
7780 2018-06-29 21:09:39 Actually, CBD oil is very effective in treating several medical issues, most importantly, pain. Relatively expensive since not grown locally. THC is not in hemp, so no high. Will be good as a replacement crop for tobacco in those states.

7791 2018-06-29 21:06:54 We have a trade deficit with the canadians.  They are insane to impose tarifs in on us.  They will loose 100s of thousands  of jobs. The way we are going we could stop buying oil from them next year.  It will be very bad for Canada.

7802 2018-06-29 21:05:21 Trump is NOT your crazy old uncle. He a calculating grifter posing as businessman. He get outplayed in most business dealings. Got in debt up to his neck with Russia. And sold out to Putin. His is the art of the BS. And he has the alt right megaphone selling his snake oil
7803 2018-06-29 21:05:11 Trump rescinded a regulation that offshore, underwater drills must have a Safety Valve - to  prevent oil spills, like the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion, deaths & pollution of the Gulf Of Mexico.  Reg was the result of a Study Commission.
7804 2018-06-29 21:05:09 Scotland's oil tax has been changed frequently over the years, making it harder for companies to plan because they don't know what they're dealing with. So rates have to be lower to attract investment.  Norway's tax regime has not changed for decades, so the reverse is true.
7805 2018-06-29 21:05:00 If you’re in New York this weekend stop on by booth 5960 at the Summer Fancy Food show. Come by to meet the #terradelyssa team. You can sample our Deglet Noor dates and olive oil. #degletnoordates #oliveoil
7806 2018-06-29 21:04:08 Lmao, is it not perfume oil?
7807 2018-06-29 21:04:04 This is the reason why we are slowly pulling away from the Middle East mr. President will the oil pipeline drop down is our biggest world largest water resource please protect it without the water the people can't live
7808 2018-06-29 21:03:47 Just ran a story that people are bathing in crude oil for "their skin and joints". 

WHY? 

People, there are Epsom salts and bath bombs that are so much better than 10W40.
7809 2018-06-29 21:03:35 Why the f#$% is it so hard to find valvoline vr1 oil in a town that has like 10 sprint car teams and numerous other race teams !
7810 2018-06-29 21:03:28 The mind boggles. Though, to be fair, FAT OR OIL are (sometimes) liquids, and definitely messed with the plumbing.
7811 2018-06-29 21:03:27 Black Oil Modelの決定的な欠点がわからない。誰か教えてください。。。
7812 2018-06-29 21:03:06 i wish i had that natural glow but instead i got oil
7813 2018-06-29 21:03:00 If you’re in New York this weekend stop on by booth 5960 at the Summer Fancy Food show. Come by to discuss your bulk olive oil and specialty oil needs and meet our team.  #bulkbycho #choamerica #oliveoil
7814 2018-06-29 21:03:00 Currency is not an issue. Can you name me a single country that doesn't have a currency? We'll have our own this time. And oil accounts for less that 15% of our economy - have you seen the price this week? The drop in price had minimal impact anyway as we also burn oil.
7815 2018-06-29 21:02:42 ion have the patience for oil changes, shit take too damn long
7816 2018-06-29 21:02:38 I’ve been really productive today. Bought my best friend’s baby shower gift, got my oil changed, shampooed and conditioned my weave, and now accounting homework. Whew!
7817 2018-06-29 21:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
7818 2018-06-29 21:02:18 I want to stay in and rub your feet with baby oil 
7819 2018-06-29 21:02:16 When I go in the sea I can literally see the sea salt on my skin  better stop sitting in the sun with coconut oil on 
7820 2018-06-29 21:02:06 My nana asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I said I wanted them to get my oil changed. Needless to say she didn’t believe me, but I really hate doing it.
7821 2018-06-29 21:01:42 A question about olive oil. 

Am I the only one that detects no flavor from it? I keep seeing people go crazy over olive oil, but to me it just tastes like liquid air. 

What am I missing?
7822 2018-06-29 21:01:36 Following up after Bush repealed it great decision Obama gave you three rigs anchor in Alaska your pipeline was also part of Obama once this oil pipeline is fully attached and operational by 2020 you will still be in office for the rewards but Obama gave you three rigs
7823 2018-06-29 21:01:25 Got bad news for Arnold. Coal and oil are what powers our civilization until nuclear fusion or solar arrays in space. No amount of crying or whining will change that fact.
7824 2018-06-29 21:01:19 I throw fresh florets into the oil and just fry them until they are suuuuper brown and crispy. It rules.
7825 2018-06-29 21:01:17 i bought a @Groupon @GrouponHelpUS for an oil change. that’s all I got, an oil change... and then I had to pay more.... what????!
7826 2018-06-29 21:01:16 Any source for this 0.5% ? Apart from prices, rationalising oil imports by reducing buffers at higher prices, buying more at lower prices, improving efficiency of fossil fuel based power plants, could lead to lower oil import bill.
7827 2018-06-29 21:01:00 Misleading headline since it ignores the value added, incomes, and taxes generated from increased oil activities in oil-producing states.  Oh, and don't forget the royalties that landowners make too.  
oil equities increased too where investment and retirement money is!
7828 2018-06-29 21:00:49 The Kardashians, if properly rendered, could provide enough lamp oil to illuminate a third world library for weeks.
7829 2018-06-29 21:00:47 So much Duh. People insist on fairy tales. Whether it's perpetual bliss ("Just answer a few questions & be happy forever!"), or healing scored thru a hug or someone's gaze, or just plain ol' snake oil... Con-people always take advantage of the craving for easy miracles

7831 2018-06-29 21:00:36 Um... Hardly, so far you don't know how Barnett works, you don't know why Scotland isn't as rich as Norway (despite extraction more oil than them) you don't know why they stopped producing Scottish accounts in 1921, is there anything at all you DO know?
7832 2018-06-29 21:00:31 I'm currently getting my oil changed and I know very very little about cars so it's stressful for me and the guy keeps asking me if there is things I want done and I'm like "idk sure"
7833 2018-06-29 21:00:29 “Assad! Oil! Imperialism! Dollars! Secularism! Conspiracy!”

*silence*
7834 2018-06-29 21:00:29 I knoww, SEM. Start with oils cleanse and oiling at night. One step at a time.

Oil cleanse 

Steam face
Mix 2 oils - Coconut & castor mix is fine
Massage into face firmly. Upward right movt 
Dip face towel in boiling hot water
Cover face 2 minsu
Wipe off oil w towel 

A Glow.
7835 2018-06-29 21:00:23 We know. You're already selling off our national monuments for pennies on the dollar to foreign miners/oil workers. And American companies are creating job... for people overseas. When you add those numbers up then yeah, our job creating stats go up.
7836 2018-06-29 21:00:22 Money is the oil, you put oil in as the government does the economy.
I thought that was quite a clear analogy.
7837 2018-06-29 21:00:19 June 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

7844 2018-06-29 20:59:38 Yeah man from way back he said it was during the era they increased civil servants salary i think it was around 1976-78 according to him during the oil boom
7845 2018-06-29 20:59:33 Decided to cook chinese food instead of ordering takeout to be healthier and save money but I literally spent twice the amount on ingredients and with the amount of oil I used I’m pretty sure it’s not any healthier 
7846 2018-06-29 20:59:31 Check out the spray olive oil!  It is amazing for coating veggies etc!
7847 2018-06-29 20:59:07 I would love to express deliver a case of hair oil for Josh. His hair is looking dry and thirsty as fuck! #loveisland
7848 2018-06-29 20:59:00 I didn't say police.  I said an attorney.  And if the guy you stop has a particularly vindictive one?  I wouldn't doubt them combing through your social media.
7849 2018-06-29 20:58:59 No matter how old I get... having another man oil me up and massage me at these massage parlors will always feel a little strange

7851 2018-06-29 20:58:43 Okay but what if Lebron actually does come to Philly how will the city afford all of the oil and butter for the poles #sixers #Lebron
7852 2018-06-29 20:58:09 Mr. President the record must be set straight on the reasons why today you are in the Alaska Straits drilling for oil. One Clinton sign an executive order preventing Drilling bad decision by the president Bush behind him repealed it under the Wars Powers Act.
7853 2018-06-29 20:57:11 The Oil claims and dithering on currency killed the economic case last time and that’s not really a debate.
There is a long way to go still to address those issues if there is a 2.
It will be interesting to see.

7855 2018-06-29 20:57:04 1st pic burns. 2nd pic, I used Melaleuca oil w/ carrier oil... Burn completely stopped,  and less redness!
7856 2018-06-29 20:56:55 It is the only solution. The oil patch must die so that the Earth can live.
7857 2018-06-29 20:56:27 EVERYDAY!
7858 2018-06-29 20:56:26 I was planning on going to the beach with money. But after getting a new computer and being screwed over at a oil changing place....I'm going to the beach broke af.  But I'm going y'all
7859 2018-06-29 20:56:18 my mom jacking my vape all night and passing around an oil pen is one of the more peculiar things i’ve begun to witness
7860 2018-06-29 20:56:14 What did this  pathetic propagandist pimp say about BUT HER EMAILS, tho? Stop pandering to this illusionist. He thinks this is a Las Vegas show.

7862 2018-06-29 20:56:05 Best $120 I could ever spend. I spend almost that much on a tank of gas thanks to the ridiculous corporate driven oil culture supported by The Greatest Country of All Times.
7863 2018-06-29 20:56:05 having the oil fields, agricultural areas and not giving them to the saa is more harmful for assad than losting a few of soldiers or aircrafts.
7864 2018-06-29 20:55:59 With the oil prices going up every month, I'm looking for hold HVST to see if the company have good earnings (and of course analysts upgrading the stock, hedge funds, Institutions  buying it) , instead od seeling at the 1 day of opening for a quick $, what you think?

7868 2018-06-29 20:55:24 Odd since I'm Italian.... butter and olive oil were a staple growing up.
7869 2018-06-29 20:55:15 It seems Nigeria has forgotten that its most valuable resource is its people. Not oil, not foreign currency, but the many individuals that are struggling to survive within it. #ABetterNigeria
7870 2018-06-29 20:55:14 Question about essential oils/cats!!! I bough an oil diffuser for my room and I have some essential oils. It’s it safe to have on with my cat constantly in the room and are their any essential oils that are bad for cats to be around? Please and thank you 
7871 2018-06-29 20:54:49 #MAGA - "Oil prices surged to their highest level in more than 3 yrs on Thursday, as the number & volume of supply outages continue to rise.

7873 2018-06-29 20:54:25 Oil change, get my car washed, fill the tank up and food maybe? But WHERRRE?!
7874 2018-06-29 20:53:58 What "absence of business"? Even @ElizabethMay admitted there is a huge market for AB oil outside the US.
7875 2018-06-29 20:53:46 [TEENAGE JOKE TEENAGE JOKE]
I IMAGINE THAT SAID SPITTLE CLEARED A BIT OF THE OIL FROM PUBERTY AND MAY HAVE BROUGHT SOME INSPIRATION OF A FUTURE ACNE CREAM DERIVED FROM SALIVA IN WHICH MAGA'S ARE CAPTURED LIKE HORSESHOE CRABS AND FED A STEADY DIET OF MINORITY IMAGERY

7876 2018-06-29 20:53:44 You gave away 100Mt of our carbon budget to the oil sands to get it.

A bill. A payment. A grocery list. A oil change. A refill/ spa day. A lace front install. A bundle install. Even a doctor visit .. tf 
7879 2018-06-29 20:52:45 Funny that you'd call the EV crowd defensive.
Nope, we're full on the offensive side against oil mongers. Expect no less than to be called out for your alliance with fossil fuels and trying to keep the status quo.
7880 2018-06-29 20:52:45 Or we laugh as exports to the US represent 20% of GDP. Good luck sending wood, oil, and gas on a ship... will do exceptionally well!
7881 2018-06-29 20:52:44 I didn't say ending the threat couldn't mean killing an assailant.  It's just that a vindictive attorney can easily take your first statement as a "desire to kill someone" and possibly influence a jury against you.  Please take as much action as is required to go home tonight.
7882 2018-06-29 20:52:37 One simple word winning
7883 2018-06-29 20:52:30 Saudis r the US puppets. Oil from Iraq was much better as Saddam they couldn't control.
7884 2018-06-29 20:52:30 My sister decided to empty this Narciso Rodriguez Perfume Oil into a smaller bottle and this whole room is filled with it. 

So proud.
7885 2018-06-29 20:52:11 Bella got new tires, an oil change & a full tank of gas all within the last two days...I’m broke
7886 2018-06-29 20:52:00 Thanks media, now I can drain my oil finally!
7887 2018-06-29 20:51:59 @RichardLochhead @CrownEstateScot They're selling all Scotland's assets before Independence all lands oil fields resources
7888 2018-06-29 20:51:58 I was even arguing with myself that I didn't add red oil.
7889 2018-06-29 20:51:43 @ngaio420 been watching cooking on high. Why only butter and oil? I would like to see some herb heavy cream, or nut butter, or maybe even avocado. Also I wish the chefs would try to pair the flavor rather than try to hide it. Regardless I appreciate your contribution to the show.
7890 2018-06-29 20:51:40 Oil change 
7891 2018-06-29 20:51:35 Before I mask, I wipe away any dirt with rose water and witch hazel then I mask with that Garnier Charcoal exfoliating wash. After that, I tone w that Natures Refreshments Tea Tree oil toner. I moisturize w my eczema ointments so I can’t recommend those.
7892 2018-06-29 20:51:34 Because who doesn't need an oil drum of vodka or condiments
7893 2018-06-29 20:51:24 Its a hole u drop oil in
7894 2018-06-29 20:51:17 It’s Syncrude but a few people told me that the pipelines are full

7896 2018-06-29 20:51:10 We don't know yet! But it's a safe assumption that they will be permitting some amount of leasing for oil drilling and fracking, given the orientation and political donors of the current administration.
7897 2018-06-29 20:51:01 That’s not the official Sessions account @jeffsessions is the real account
7898 2018-06-29 20:50:56 If he can’t change my oil, I don’t want him.
7899 2018-06-29 20:50:45 Look how he takes an opportunity to credit Ru, but ignores Puerto Rico, or all the other struggles of US citizens.
Imposing tariffs on allies, hurt them & most of US.
Helps Ru & big oil & big biz he likes. 
7900 2018-06-29 20:50:43 The resources of all of europe aren't enough to compete with just the USSR, let alone all the allied nations except the USSR.

Without access to lots of chromium and oil they'd have the same production problems.

The US and Canada could make up for the lack of USSR 1/2
7901 2018-06-29 20:50:29 Look at the record $1.7 time spread in WTI. The time spread in Brent is $0.4 only. Libya, Iran, etc. do not explain the difference.
7902 2018-06-29 20:50:23 I've been saying the oil companies should shut down in California for years. Will take about 10 minutes for these dipsticks to wake up.

7904 2018-06-29 20:50:03 My friend is really pushing for Fracking Zac (hes willing to compromise on Oil Zac for the name). It comes with a hat that doesnt change in size despite how big or small Zac may be at the time

7912 2018-06-29 20:49:07 Ahh.. the ignorance spreading snake oil salesmen have expanded to Europe. Before y'all take Infowars Europe too seriously I suggest y'all look up all the videos of the failed predictions of Alex Jones as well as how many batshit crazy things that have been promoted by them.
7913 2018-06-29 20:49:07 Oil and gas are the same and the price of gas has gone up over 30 cents a gallon under Trump.
The coal miners are still wanting for their jobs to come back and Carrier in Indiana went to Mexico anyway...but Trump owes stock in it so Trump doesn’t care about American workers.

7917 2018-06-29 20:48:49 Oil change and low beams replaced for a Mercedes equals 210....
7918 2018-06-29 20:48:41 The dystopia shifts from the rural community where we have adapted to the cities where they can't. The rural urban covenant breaks down and a Malthusian nightmare begins. Oil is currently approaching $80. The poor earlier pricing means little exploration has occurred. It begins..

7922 2018-06-29 20:47:57 Hearing rumblings the Oil and Nucks are in heavy conversations with Dubas and Leafs Nation for the mean machine and press box queen, Matt Martin. Both teams looking for skill and grit, I think this is a great addition for either club
7923 2018-06-29 20:47:40 Greg Abbott :You are a disgrace to Texas, bought and paid for by the NRA, big oil corporations imposed your religious views on the people.
7924 2018-06-29 20:47:13 He can always send Kudlow to Fox News and have him lie about the oil price.

7927 2018-06-29 20:47:04 Good, only 19 state will vote 2019, we have 36 States and oil producing States are not including
7928 2018-06-29 20:47:03 On a positive note I was expecting some expensive news on my car today.  But my dad and I fixed my fuel injection issues with some STP products and my brakes were still in great condition.   $16 bill for oil change and tire rotation was .
7929 2018-06-29 20:46:55 Free oil change and they fixed whatever was minor 
7930 2018-06-29 20:46:40 Duck would be occasional. But pretty high fat then ....

I'd say meat protein in my case is 80% beef and 20% other (fish, chicken, pork, occasional duck) on a typical week.

No seed oils, obviously. Mostly cook w/butter, some olive & coconut oil.

I see eggs aren't that hi in n6?

Shoddy would be a good description.

And here we thought our oil kept California in supply.

You sure are a lippy keyboard cowboy.

7938 2018-06-29 20:44:45 Salt water spills are more damaging than oil spills that's for sure.  

If we care about the environment more than politics we would talk more about salt water containment and disposal.

7942 2018-06-29 20:43:38 Americans, and everyone else who cares to know, Oregano oil kills both fungal and viral infections. It is potent. Put it on your carbuncles, ugly bumps, potential melanomas and burn those suckers off with no scar. painful, itchy but beats chemo. be persistent. do not eat
7943 2018-06-29 20:43:35 Wait. An argan oil advert??

7947 2018-06-29 20:43:10 Great! I guess we can now expect you to stop trying to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, right? But wait, if any of that mattered (or were true)  why are corporations doing such huge stock buybacks? Doesn't make any sense at all. I think you're selling more snake oil.
7948 2018-06-29 20:42:36 Crude oil caps huge weekly gains amid global supply outages
7949 2018-06-29 20:42:26 The SNP were no angels either on occasion and both sides took liberties and exaggerated.
Remember Oil Revenues?
Erm, hello!
It’s done for now.
7950 2018-06-29 20:42:19 What about the elites who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars & an oil refinery business @ birth? 

Shouldn't these few elites be allowed to use their great wealth to influence & manipulate American Democracy for their own financial self-interest?
7951 2018-06-29 20:42:07 Ummm..... that's why we want to build this Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. So we don't have to sell our oil to the U.S. ! We want to sell our clean ethical oil on the world market. 
Try to to keep up.
7952 2018-06-29 20:42:02 That isn't fair to CNN. CNN is generally truthful (although not 100%) just very sensational. On Infowars they just spout complete fucking nonsense on the regular. Then they just happen to have the ridiculous snake oil product that can keep you safe from that nonsense.
7953 2018-06-29 20:41:35 Castor oil?
7954 2018-06-29 20:41:35 I want a conventional oil change only nothing more, nothing extra

7957 2018-06-29 20:41:25 Try bathing with a tablespoon of coconut oil. It soothes the skin from burns, rashes, acne. Also find a diy coconut scrub for your face that works for you! Pinterest is your bff

7959 2018-06-29 20:41:14 India preparing for 'cut in oil imports from Iran' @AJENews. India has many friends who will gladly step in to fill the gap as it would be risky for her to continue with Iran oil imports. When America sneezes the whole World catches a cold. Beware India.
7960 2018-06-29 20:41:12 Yep, all three examples are a joke, they're all made up, The Highland Clearances are made up, our oil wealth is made up, our inventions are made up our industrial revolution is made up, keep denying it fool But I've wasted enough time on you. Ciao.
7961 2018-06-29 20:40:57 Blockchain will fuel the next oil boom.  Data and blockchain will be the next gold rush. Being part of the next gold rush may be worth risking it all. Sit back and watch or participate. Have a great day all.

Donald is a snake oil salesman and you have fell for it hook, line and sinker. Sorry Ed but I think you've been fooled by him
7971 2018-06-29 20:39:49 I filled up in Edmonton @ 116.6.  There's no place in BC with a price even close to that, and still people are protesting Alberta oil pipelines. #BCroads
7972 2018-06-29 20:39:38 Yes. You must be young. Too young to have experienced the affect of the Arab oil embargo. Inflation devastated the economy in the 70's. Inflation at 12%, interest rates at 18-20%. That was just one commodity, oil.
7973 2018-06-29 20:39:37 I put peppermint oil in my humidifier. So I should put it on my temples?

You're welcome.

7980 2018-06-29 20:38:03 Most of this difference tracks global oil price data really closely. Oil is a commodity and prices are decided by international benchmarks. G2G negotiations impact less than 0.5% of the price. In fact buying from Iran would be cheaper now but GOI stopping due to pressure from US

7982 2018-06-29 20:37:31 What Buhari is doing to southerners, only God can help us. Oil money looted from the Niger Delta by Abacha, 90% or more of it being shared with all the northern states and 3SW, 1SE and no SS state. Never have I seen a very tribalistic fellow and the worst ever to head a country.
7983 2018-06-29 20:36:51 Yeah, the whole maintenance thing is can be an eye opener. Sythetic oil?! Special coolant/anti freeze!? Special washer fluid (I passed)!? You don't turn brake rotors, you just replace them?! and so on and so on...
7984 2018-06-29 20:36:46 I still can’t get over the “algorithms are not assets and cryptocurrency is actually fucking worthless bullshit snake oil sorcery” minor issue.  Wall Street went for subprime mort’s too.
7985 2018-06-29 20:36:45 India needs energy for its burgeoning economy. If US doesn't want it to come from Iran, then its US's job to show the alternatives :-) Let them send more Shale oil to India at concessional rates ;-)
7986 2018-06-29 20:36:37 I agree, Pk has been made a scape goat. 61 million tonnes of palm oil consumed globally each year. Stopping Pk use won't reduce that.

7988 2018-06-29 20:36:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
7989 2018-06-29 20:36:04 the other thing is how does this relate to their existing assets and business model? their existing assets are tied to mobility via oil. not sure how providing EV charging at scale doesn’t undermine their ability to realise value from oil concessions ...
7990 2018-06-29 20:36:01 Can you apply for medicaid?? If not, melatonin can help, but I'm sure you're already familiar with that. Another option is to try cbd oil, but that can get quite expensive as well, depending on how much it takes to help you sleep. (Part 1)
7991 2018-06-29 20:36:00 My parents have this cool machine where you can put some oil and whatever you want inside, and it "air fries" it. Literally the laziest cooking device I've used, but I love it.

8002 2018-06-29 20:33:40 He would have bags filled with chocolate mishapes, jars of Lime marmalade & (my cousins hated this) bottles of cod liver oil. We were very popular & because we had so much, generous with our bounty.

8010 2018-06-29 20:32:53 It is oil actually but it's not very practical for me, so at the moment I'm using acrylics all the time. If oils dried quicker, or if I had more space, I'd be painting in that medium.
8011 2018-06-29 20:32:48 That's not enough oil
8012 2018-06-29 20:32:45 Mbe if we didn’t let wealthy corps not pay taxes or very little and we didn’t spend 60% of our budget on military manufacturing and wars for oil we could take care of American citizens

8019 2018-06-29 20:32:27 I make me some spicy hummus with olive oil and eat it with some pita or naan and listen to Greek music while reading Aristotle and hit that bottle.

b. just burn it

Yeah, he was fired.

8073 2018-06-29 20:26:12 Which have all been paltry, while corporations use billions to buy back stock and Wall St. Takes huge bonuses. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else

8076 2018-06-29 20:25:59 So buhari wants to share the $321m abacha loot to 19 northern states that don't even produce oil which the money was stolen from!!
8077 2018-06-29 20:25:53 What the heck is 'argan oil'? Is this some old thing we hate (like palm oil) rebranded, or some new habitat and more multiple species invaded?
8078 2018-06-29 20:25:46 yeah checked if oil level sensor was low, it’s fueled up, checked the spark plug and it has compression so idk what else it could be. Even trying starting it without the air filter and nothing.
8079 2018-06-29 20:25:32 Since when has eating octopus in oil ever been classed as good nosh... LOL

8082 2018-06-29 20:25:04 I loveeeeee summer bc my skin is always so soft from all the coconut oil I put all over my skin to catch some rays 
8083 2018-06-29 20:25:03 He removed a dictator who murders hundreds of thousands of his own people with gas and who had also invaded at least 2 other countries with an intention of developing atomic capability with oil revenue to back him up.
I would take that bet again.
8084 2018-06-29 20:25:03 TX loves NAFTA. Wisconsin and the rust belt are getting hosed. Are we part of the US or not? And TX oil and gas doesn’t need anymore breaks from anyone. In fact all tax breaks & subsidies need to end.
8085 2018-06-29 20:25:02 Darn it. We could put the holy oil around his kennel and then I could light it on fire. It’d keep him in. Even as a duck, he’s still an angel.
8086 2018-06-29 20:24:56 Wait! This viral audio that has gone round whatsapp was is coming from land of oil ministry?
8087 2018-06-29 20:24:52 I don’t think it’s ever hit above 20 @oilfractals would know

8099 2018-06-29 20:23:59 I suppose so, but that seems to leave patients vulnerable to being preyed upon by scam artists. And when they claim to cure ailments that rigorously tested medical science can only manage, many forego treatment for what amounts to snake oil. SMH
8100 2018-06-29 20:23:52 is that so. Then why don’t you stop Zince from destroying said Parks for oil company profits.
8101 2018-06-29 20:23:47 Like the twist on salad dressings using rapeseed instead of olive oil- would love to try!

8109 2018-06-29 20:22:46 Ethiopia is special. this country has ethics: The head of state does control all of them. we are talking central power.    Somali region prisons must be freed. for the oil man, it has to respect all systems. every one must be happy to avoid trouble when you produce oil.
8110 2018-06-29 20:22:39 I was thinking magic tanning oil or some such nonsense
8111 2018-06-29 20:22:33 I believe FED swap lines have been open again in Europe since LIBOR started to flair. Doubt there will be a dollar shortage, if that's what you're getting at. That said, Dollar has been strong. Repatriation has fueled a lot of it... and a weak, oil deficient European economy.

8116 2018-06-29 20:21:51 True, but it would be a very different life than we have now. Of course eventually the oil will run out or rather become unviable to extract, then the dystopia begins and all manner of fun ensues. Prior to that, oil becomes very expensive and the rioting starts.
8117 2018-06-29 20:21:50 And they can’t poop, so they just eat up face oil til the die in your pores.

8122 2018-06-29 20:21:18 El @MinHacienda, Mauricio Cárdenas, advirtió que, tras la estabilidad reciente que ha tenido el peso colombiano #USDCOP frente al dólar, se debe tener presente el riesgo que puede tener una depreciación de la moneda nacional. #Ojo Depreciación, el #Oil no es el drive, No lo es!
8123 2018-06-29 20:21:09 I saw a tweet about Norway being 40% Renewable Energy soon. Germany, China also will have a big jump on the US by the time Big Oil gives in to the inevitable. Trump and GOP Sugar Daddies' greed will put us in an expensive hole shortly . $$$$ Folks. Through your nose .

8128 2018-06-29 20:20:25 I’d like to think that oil for cars was majorly trial and error. Like there were a couple of cars that exploded that were filled with milk.
8129 2018-06-29 20:20:18 Tomorrow morning I’m gone be adulting  oil change, car wash, going to the bank

8141 2018-06-29 20:18:53 No. I mean full time jobs lost and it had nothing to do with price of oil. Everything changed when the anti-pipeline Liberals got elected

8167 2018-06-29 20:15:02 Stop blaming it on lazy youths. When politicians are stacking oil money in banks abroad rather than using it to create jobs. You think those people don’t know about death? But most of them see it as a means of livelihood in a corrupt country. Not like I’m in support of them tho

8218 2018-06-29 20:09:11 "Competitive pressures" You mean like cartels in oil or media? Mankind always does better when cooperating. Mankind always does better when they show empathy, when they share. The current individualism, or atomisation - when you are on your own, your weak and vulnerable!

8229 2018-06-29 20:07:33 I just filled up the windshield wiper fluid, and you would think I changed the oil, rotated my tires, and rebuilt my engine by my feeling of accomplishment. Yes. I did that. I do deserve a cupcake. Crushing the game!

8232 2018-06-29 20:07:04 Iran's biggest customers are China, India and Turkey.

2 out of the 3 are ready to openly defy Trump's desire for an oil embargo (Erdogan being a hot head will seize this opportunity).

India might want to comply, but high oil prices might force them to continue buying from Iran.

8237 2018-06-29 20:06:35 It takes more oil to produce solar panels right now than to just burn oil.  When the technologies become available I'll support solar, but right now it's just not there.  We should put that money into research and development not solyndra.
8238 2018-06-29 20:06:23 Except for Alberta oil and gas. We won’t stand up for them. We have effectively shut down all new pipelines except transmountain which we bought and will start any day now ;). Soon with the transfer payments we will bleed Alberta dry and they will be our slaves. Buah ha ha ha ha!
8239 2018-06-29 20:06:17 So no Trump Hotels in the Grand Canyon? ...& no oil drilling?  I won't pop the champagne corks just yet.
8240 2018-06-29 20:05:58 Authoritarian regimes who rely on their oil and gas resources to stay in power should continue to be afraid. #permiania

8243 2018-06-29 20:05:43 Amend your 'carbon' tax plans. We produce 3 to 4 million BPD of oil and ship 3 million BPD to the USA. Your Carbon tax becomes a defacto penalty on one of our most important exports, while still allowing 1 million BPD of oil imports w/NO carbon tax.  U think about that, Minister.

8247 2018-06-29 20:05:17 I mopped up as much of the spicy, garlicky, prawn-infused oil as I could manage with copious amounts of bread. If I hadn't ordered another five dishes I'd probably have just slurped up the rest.

8253 2018-06-29 20:04:25 My thoughts exactly, but sadly seems they just want to make a quick buck by exporting the whole crude oil

8260 2018-06-29 20:02:55 2. Olive Oil
Olive oil is a well-known natural remedy for thicker hair growth as well as eyelashes. This oil is rich in vitamin E and oleic acid that nourish and add volume to your eyelashes. It also helps keep the lashes dark.
8261 2018-06-29 20:02:33 Aspirations and sensitivity equate to oil and water because your not sensitive to my aspirations. Ego will constrain someone else’s aspirations. Your truth is not my truth. I can see fit to give you the benefit of a doubt until you aspire to give me a reason not too. 
8262 2018-06-29 20:02:29 No more oil over people in Syria! Let deep state take a jail brake!  Most Muslims peaceful unless infiltrated by deep state global funding! Desperate measures for desperate elites make genocide normal.  Complicit equals complacent 
8263 2018-06-29 20:02:27 Texas Tech + Oil Patch jobs.
8264 2018-06-29 20:02:16 Marula oil
8265 2018-06-29 20:02:15 First half of the year ends with #DOW down #SP flat and # NASDAQ  up. Oil continues to rally. Expect very low volumes next week.
8266 2018-06-29 20:02:12 1. Castor Oil
The powerful follicle-stimulating and nourishing castor oil can help you enjoy lustrous and voluminous lashes. It also helps fight micro-organisms that hamper growth.
8267 2018-06-29 20:02:05 I love the feeling of washing off all my tanning oil after tanning outside
8268 2018-06-29 20:01:59 The ‘auto sector’ as you know it will be gone in 10-15 years. The ICE is dead & EVs are the future. All the casting, engine assembly, exhaust, air cleaner, oil filter, spark plug, oil, and on and on plants will be empty and the jobs and trade gone.
8269 2018-06-29 20:01:52 I think @Ocasio2018 expressed the essence of it pretty well.  She said, "the GOP is freaking out because I'm going to send their kids to college."
8270 2018-06-29 20:01:33 Sounds reasonable. 

I have a wife who would do that . . . Except hacking my system would be more about like castor oil in my orange juice.

Though, that would be overreacting.
8271 2018-06-29 20:01:25 Crude oil like you
8272 2018-06-29 20:01:10 Calhum, it has been stated in WM Parliament that Scotland in no way is subsidized by anyone. Over the last 40+ years Scottish oil alone has kept the UK afloat.
Scotland has a Net export/import balance, England does not.
8273 2018-06-29 20:01:09 Hard to say. Economics isn’t taught in schools nor capitalism. Perhaps they don’t understand it was “their” system that destroyed a vibrant oil economy in Venezuela. Or they’re believing the party line about the tent cities in LA. Or they just haven’t the brains of a chicken.?
8274 2018-06-29 20:01:05 By the way Mexico is going the same rout Lopez Obrador is the worst liar  and corrupt person he also like Kim young  murdered his brother on an issue of oil in Tabasco investigate
8275 2018-06-29 20:01:02 I guess you won’t mind when we hit 2C food won’t grow. Extinctions are on the rise. We are not immune. We’re next. We aren’t doing one thing to slow it down. His oil buddies will have us dead by 2026. Say scientists

8277 2018-06-29 20:00:39 Oh yuck!
No idea if this works, but I've heard that if you pee around your perimeter, they can smell if you eat meat & keep clear. Pepper spray or citrus essential oil mixed with alcohol in a spray bottle might help too. Other that comes to mind is peppermint oil, ditto.
8278 2018-06-29 20:00:13 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
8279 2018-06-29 20:00:13 i was like, i could have sworn i had changed my oil super recently too?? AND YEP I DID, IT JUST WASN'T HOLDING ON TO IT AT ALL

8285 2018-06-29 19:59:35 You should feel full from all the tears Americans caused to the world. Do you enjoy the tears of children in , Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya,Iran,Syria,Vietnam,Korea,laos ,and many many more who had the bad lack to have oil or leaders who Americans didn't like.
8286 2018-06-29 19:59:27 It would behoove them to pay up front, but all it takes is s .01 cent tariff on oil. Don't be such a Debby Downer. The economy is booming. Most people are happy. I'm sorry you're not.
There is a gofundme page for the wall.
8287 2018-06-29 19:59:15 I will cross my fingers that this is a positive step for electric vehicles and not (as history might imply) oil company dirty tricks. 
8288 2018-06-29 19:59:07 しれっと出てるのがいいですねｗｗｗ
8289 2018-06-29 19:58:47 isn't it amazing how water cleans itself up? Like, if you spill it on yourself? Wouldn't it be great if everything was like that. Oops, broke a bottle of olive oil, no worries it'll evaporate into nothingness soon
8290 2018-06-29 19:58:47 His wife is his Vice President. His daughter runs the Aliev foundation and was married to Emin, who along with his father run the largest oil AND investment company (Crocus group) in AZ. Before Ilham, his father ruled AZ for years. Sounds like a dynasty, not a democratic govt

8295 2018-06-29 19:58:34 Oh that looks really nasty.  If you’re going out in the evenings or anytime through the long grass put some tea tree oil on your pulse points as that should keep the biters away

8342 2018-06-29 19:51:39 It's crazy how other African countries are managing to make strides in different areas and Nigeria literally has nothing to show for all that oil money, vast lands for agriculture and large population resource. We'll be the laughing stock of the entire continent

8344 2018-06-29 19:51:30 Never followed the idiot. Worked for 8 years with the state trooper screwing oil company whore and did nothing. Didn't support teachers. Didn't increase taxes on big oil. Basically sat in corner and fondled himself
8345 2018-06-29 19:51:26 u concede noise, Lakewoodites don't want their lake view marred by wind turbines, birds will die & a for profit project is subsidized. 

Yet we're a wash in cheap proven, efficient, domestic energy from coal, oil, gas &  hydro.

You're pushing a solution in search of a problem
8346 2018-06-29 19:51:23 行けるか微妙だけどライブ予約して会社に行く
8347 2018-06-29 19:51:20 今回も主催はOILさんなんです？
8348 2018-06-29 19:51:12 fuck modding your whip, get a oil change first 
8349 2018-06-29 19:51:09 Need fi oil my waistline cause when me go home me wah go party
8350 2018-06-29 19:51:04 You asked and we did it!  Three SLS free shampoo bars and one conditioner bar.  Organic and amazing.  Mango Tango, Blue Moon and Citralicious.  With Mango De Tango conditioning bar.  $10.  Sodium cocoa sulfate, hemp seed oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter are the base.
8351 2018-06-29 19:51:04 i put coconut oil on my feet and now that i’m sweating my socks are a tropical sesspool
8352 2018-06-29 19:50:55 "Laying out a plan". So basically more cash will exchange hands between Big Sugar/Big Oil/NRA and GOP candidates in order to keep killing the Everglades, Coastal Waterways and Estuaries and allow Big Oil to resume offshore drilling now that Trump has signed off on pollution.
8353 2018-06-29 19:50:46 I was hoping big oil would ignore EVs until it was too late to stop them, but, maybe it is already too late to stop them.
8354 2018-06-29 19:50:44 Not really. Try and get your agricultural goods from somewhere else. Those types of things don’t last traveling over sea. We can produce our own oil in the gulf. You ice bucket challenge of a country won’t get far. Side note: I’m not a trump supporter, just stating facts.
8355 2018-06-29 19:50:38 I'm a liberal activist, too. We're all about community. But not so much about big oil.
8356 2018-06-29 19:50:37 True Life: Jamaican Castor Oil brought my edges back
8357 2018-06-29 19:50:31 There was more oil on that piece of pepperoni then I have in my body.
8358 2018-06-29 19:50:22 After their oil?  Why?  We don't need it.. Do you read? Can you read?  Google "Biggest EXPORTER of oil".. READ.. If it were about money it would be us NOT wanting Venezuela to produce more oil to keep the price up.. You are not smart.
8359 2018-06-29 19:50:14 Blaming the NDP for the fact that wages are depressed is like blaming the CDN government for the price of a barrel of oil. It's a non-starter, but people who don't read buy into the ideology. Alberta is an oil dependant province. Most of your eggs are in one basket.  Who's fault?
8360 2018-06-29 19:49:42 What budget problems with oil @ $74?
8361 2018-06-29 19:49:15 To the asshole at GoodYear I just needed a simple oil check and tire check for our road trip you aikae
8362 2018-06-29 19:49:15 All for GOD (Gold, Oil, Dollars)
8363 2018-06-29 19:49:11 Well said. I agree with you I am Socially Left Driven Ergo Socialist and Duncan G AM Show is Capitalistly Right Driven Ergo Capitalist(Corporate)=Oil and Water do not mix=BUT when I stand back and look at the Spurious arguments on behalf of The Right used by AM=Anti-People,Poor..

8366 2018-06-29 19:48:55 I think so. Those plastic bags are organic material, extracted and distilled from natural crude oil.

8374 2018-06-29 19:48:07 And if you're saying we should nationalize the oil and gas industry in America.. Where do I sign up?
8375 2018-06-29 19:48:01 And you know what? That’s fine, most wars are like that. But just don’t get on your high horse pretending you are the good guys when you are napalming children or robbing a country of oil..
8376 2018-06-29 19:47:55 It makes my hair smell like cod liver oil
8377 2018-06-29 19:47:51 I also love when people drastically overestimate the weight of makeup. Like hell, If I *was* wearing 2 lbs of it I'd be less upset that I'm blowing like $5 per face on what amounts to a sprinkling of mica schist and some oil.
8378 2018-06-29 19:47:41 I agree. There is no more qualified hustler of snake oil, bullshit, & lies, than Barack Hussein Obama. Lap it up, puppies. In other news, Michele Obama declared herself the greatest FLOTUS of all time...........OF ALL TIME !!!

8381 2018-06-29 19:47:26 Coconut oil mask then the next morning doing Epsom salt scrub to exfoliate!
8382 2018-06-29 19:46:59 I know. When did oil become such a curse? Lol
8383 2018-06-29 19:46:38 About 85% of the world’s soybean crop is processed into meal and vegetable oil, and virtually all of that meal is used in animal feed. Some 2% of the soybean meal is further processed into soy flours & proteins for food use. About 6% of soybeans are used directly as human food.
8384 2018-06-29 19:46:18 #summerflu feeling like looking forward to #CruisingWithJaneMcDonald  whilst drinking a hot orange and sniffing olbas oil #Fridaynight #livingthedream
8385 2018-06-29 19:46:16 We were so appalled that he hasn’t learned to express not even one contrite sentence. Civility evades him like oil and water! Real people died! Can’t he put himself in their shoes? Never mind I know....
8386 2018-06-29 19:46:10 @maT_bohs discovered horse oil exists did you have a large jar in high school?
8387 2018-06-29 19:46:00 umm Norway and Sweden have tremendous oil and gas assets that they have nationalized and used to support their Bismarkian welfare state.  Despite that the effective tax rate is north of 50%.
8388 2018-06-29 19:45:48 And they have the beliefs of children.  All appetites and no idea how to provide for them.
8389 2018-06-29 19:45:45 Trump is a moron, as many in his staff can attest. Just ask Rex Tillerson.

@realDonaldTrump is the modern equivalent of a snake oil salesman. All smoke and mirrors, hype and BS. Take all that away, and all you have is a poor, little man.
8390 2018-06-29 19:45:40 Oh gamm.  girl til YouTube I been on cross when that glue wouldn’t come out til I use hair oil and shampoo and it come off with ease
8391 2018-06-29 19:45:31 I'll let a man rub oil on my back. I'm not a massagynist
8392 2018-06-29 19:45:28 vote! Coconut oil (hope it's extra virgin), is very stable at high temp. so ideal for oven baking etc. No free radicals. No premature aging concerns caused by my plate of food!

8394 2018-06-29 19:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8395 2018-06-29 19:45:15 Then that is an issue we should press in response, instead of commencing a trade war.

This has been a longstanding thorn in our relationship, from softwood to oil. Business should be private, not public.
8396 2018-06-29 19:45:15 i got a new phone two weeks ago and today i was eating a salad and the olive oil spilled directly on the speaker so now i can't hear anyone who calls me HAPPY FRIDAY xo

8400 2018-06-29 19:44:51 Need to get this oil change
8401 2018-06-29 19:44:45 Canada is the largest purchaser of US agricultural goods. We can go somewhere else. Don’t think for one minute we need you more. 40% of US Oil imports come from Canada. Hydro power comes from Canada. We need each other.
8402 2018-06-29 19:44:44 This oil belongs to KENYA first. They should refine it here for us then surplus can be exported.
8403 2018-06-29 19:44:35 50% off tanning oil so you and the boys can take gram pics
8404 2018-06-29 19:44:34 Imagine caring what other people are upto LOL, could never be me. Oil your own machine.
8405 2018-06-29 19:44:32 I can’t believe one of your TOP priorities is protecting OUR National Parks but you are letting oil companies take all that equipment into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Drill baby drill. Makes me ill.
8406 2018-06-29 19:44:16 I hope Olive Oil will be gone soon
8407 2018-06-29 19:44:10 self-care tips from CIA analysts is just the start. next up we're gonna have gardening tips from William Calley, Henry Kissinger inspiring us to move and play soccer, and Dick Cheney teaching us how to oil paint

8410 2018-06-29 19:44:01 According to Unionists, Scotland is uniquely pish at everything. Even our oil isn’t worth pulling out. If we found gold in the Highlands it would be “the wrong type” as it gets flogged through London.
Imagine these people as parents...

8413 2018-06-29 19:43:02 This is because olive oil pumps free radicals into your food at high temperatures and not healthy idea. Guessing your target audience are health savvy so would be taking notes on this.
2. Relieved that the 3rd option that you voted LAST, actually got it bang on right and get our
8414 2018-06-29 19:42:58 Trump just asked Modi to accept his suzerainty & demanded a tribute in oil. What's unreasonable about it. The joke is on you if you felt a gujju dhandho type would stand up. You need a more solid spine for that then and it cant be developed from eating vegetarian dhoklas.
8415 2018-06-29 19:42:47 @HondaCustSvc My 2016 Honda Accord would not start yesterday and when I jump started it all the warning lights came on. Once I turned it off it wouldn't start again. What should I do at this point? I got the oil changed, battery checked and everything inspected one day before.
8416 2018-06-29 19:42:46 Coconut oil will keep the first two problems at bay!!! But wowww I just love shorts (and short dresses) so much

i think if you fix his eyes it would be wonderful but i don't know if you can paint above oil paint... i am an art student but not a good one apparently 
8418 2018-06-29 19:42:40 @jimcramer Thoughts on IBM and their shift from hardware to cloud-based business? It recently almost hit a 52 week low and has now been upgraded as well as seen some boost from the tariff shenanigans and increased oil cost. Is this a buy?
8419 2018-06-29 19:42:34 $Sanctions$ Putin can't get the oil unless the sanctions are removed
8420 2018-06-29 19:42:23 The guys who are changing my oil are singing the ‘cup song’ from pitch perfect in unison...FINALLY, good service and a Performance. Now, this is what I’m talking about.
8421 2018-06-29 19:42:21 I use pore strips after that I cleanse my face using whatever cleanser after that I put tea tree oil I sill have some put it made my pores smaller and some went away but I just use the strips once then just cleanse and tea tree but be careful w the oil is kinda strong
8422 2018-06-29 19:42:17 I threw it into the oil, shortly before adding the pasta. So it was slightly fried, but still green
8423 2018-06-29 19:42:03 Pretty sure it shouldn’t take an hour and a half to get an oil change smh
8424 2018-06-29 19:42:00 @PrisonPlanet I'm a financial advisor at Wells Fargo and I always tell Trump supporters to invest their retirement savings in oil because I know they'll lose all of their money and end up homeless
8425 2018-06-29 19:41:47 selling the only CBD oil that proves 94% compared to the rest coming in at 6%. let me know if you want any! takes away arthritis pain, anxiety, joint pain, and just about anything else
8426 2018-06-29 19:41:25 And how are you paying for that 2 BILLION "protection" ? OH more debt for Canada...Get that pipeline built and start selling that oil so we can pay for the spending spree you've been on since taking office
8427 2018-06-29 19:41:23 I only use oil from Saudi Arabia, which is famously progressive.
8428 2018-06-29 19:41:22 That doesn't matter. We're talking about Azerbaijan at the moment so don't try to change the subject. And as corrupt as Armenia is, at least we don't have one family running our entire country and oil production.
8429 2018-06-29 19:41:14 It has already struck, multiple times. Those in control of the states would rather give tax cuts to oil companies, while the country rots.

8447 2018-06-29 19:38:48 Ah, I misunderstood. I put the black plate with holes in between to circumvent the dripping fat problem - sprayed it with olive oil so the skin would not stick. Turned out okay TBH.

8454 2018-06-29 19:38:03 Why 10 Rs popcorn sold at 250 in cinema hall? Mumbai high court to state?. I guess may be they are putting some gold particles on it or may be frying in olive oil. ;)
8455 2018-06-29 19:37:56 This is really good advice wallah.
8456 2018-06-29 19:37:48 How about stay the hell out of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge with your oil drilling.  What an awful thing.

8461 2018-06-29 19:37:18 In a nutshell taking resources from person A to benefit person B who has done nothing for them. This redistribution occurs AFTER those at the top have taken their share. Generally the largest share.

8463 2018-06-29 19:36:56 Nobody smokes it anymore. (Oil, edibles). It won't be sold in 7-11 or convenient stores.  And parents who smoke are more active, patient, and present than parents looking to drink & party.  Im sorry, but you don't know what your talking about.

8468 2018-06-29 19:35:53 Sir we are behind China and USA in oil imports. And crude oil imports are bought by forex reserves and not by buying USD in exchange of INR. If our forex reserve is low then we have to buy USD with INR. Forex reserves just crossed $400 bn for India. All due to devaluated INR
8469 2018-06-29 19:35:38 Thank you for letting us know. Shell Oil Products US has zero tolerance for this alleged behavior, and we take this seriously. We expect that third parties selling Shell-branded motor fuels treat every customer in a fair and inclusive manner. We are investigating this issue.

8475 2018-06-29 19:34:25 has nothing to do with oil price, mostly rates (differential and expectations) i.e. rates steady or higher in US, rates lower in Canada and headed much lower (in attempt to head off recession).
8476 2018-06-29 19:34:22 Others lost their farms and ranches, due to EPA extortion, IRS extortion, federal extortion preventing them from refining their own oil while the Texans and their Saudi isis buddies got the green light.

8479 2018-06-29 19:34:07 This essential oil obsession I have is quite expensive. Totally worth it tho!

8486 2018-06-29 19:32:56 Yep CBD oil helps me immensely!
8487 2018-06-29 19:32:46 Coconut oil tu fam..nothing more
8488 2018-06-29 19:32:33 Yay! That's what we like to hear, Michelle! We'll definitely pass along your vote for this incredible oil!
8489 2018-06-29 19:32:26 Damn dat boy breath smelled like transmission oil and pork chops earlier 
8490 2018-06-29 19:32:03 Thank you for letting us know. Shell Oil Products US has zero tolerance for this alleged behavior, and we take this seriously. We expect that third parties selling Shell-branded motor fuels treat every customer in a fair and inclusive manner. We are investigating this issue.
8491 2018-06-29 19:31:44 I’ve been at the dealership since 12:45, there’s NO REASON that I’m only getting an oil change and I’m still sitting here 
8492 2018-06-29 19:31:37 Damn that pesky oil making others rich but us poorer. The quicker it runs out the better...
8493 2018-06-29 19:31:33 Oil well that's always a possibility
8494 2018-06-29 19:31:23 I Need To Buy Me A Oil Burner  Like Soon
8495 2018-06-29 19:31:18 Killing baby bears and pup wolves in their sleep?
White supremacy?
Taking babies from their parents?
Selling our national parks to drill?
Oil platforms on our coast?
Premium raise on healthcare?
None or terribly expensive healthcare for preexisting condition?
Killing free trade?
8496 2018-06-29 19:31:12 @cafreeland I say we SUSPEND TRADE  to U,S.  No car parts = no cars.  No oil. No water. etc., etc.    We have food.  We can survive. Buy Canadian until we feel fairly dealt with. @globeandmail @AndrewScheer @CBCPolitics @CBCNews @brucesellery @CTVNews
8497 2018-06-29 19:31:11 How much did the Texas oil firms pay you to post that gem of fake numbers.

8499 2018-06-29 19:31:09 Agree. I voted remain mainly because I work for a Danish company. 
Now, they can feck off! We should of said at the start, we’re off, what can you offer? 
No of this UK needs to do a deal. You wanna sell you cars, meat and olive oil to us, you give us a deal.
8500 2018-06-29 19:31:09 LOL! Maybe they can shoot the latest one out of a cannon and he can stick the landing into a vat of boiling oil!

8507 2018-06-29 19:30:15 Canada does not share all of her policies. Guaranteed jobs with the government, regardless of need, is one of the reasons why Venezuela went bankrupt. Took over oil production (socialist move), got rid of experience+expertise, doubled the workers. Outcome: production decreased.

8511 2018-06-29 19:30:00 @Mangan150 is home made mayonnaise just to be thrown out as an idea? Can't find a single recipe advising to use non-seed oil. I'm Italian and traditionally bound not to use olive oil for it, do you have any ideas? (I'm growing celery for the first time, wanted to use it on that).
8512 2018-06-29 19:29:56 Paging John Kilduff and Dennis Gartman, who once said oil would become like “whale oil”. I made hundreds of k’s taking the other side of their trades. Thanks, suckers.
8513 2018-06-29 19:29:41 gapapa banget dong, kan untuk cleansing doang ujung2nya juga dibilas. lagian lebih enak pakai cleansing oil karena lebih gentle dan deep cleansing jg

8519 2018-06-29 19:28:57 I understand the flood of “Expressed Opinion”. Major oil companies have ‘always’ been responsible citizens & cooperative.
If the evidence is so overwhelming why do people get fired from universities or not able to publish opposing ideas. When did freedom of speech become a crime?
8520 2018-06-29 19:28:27 I genuinely hope we do, and I going to guess you don't have a fucking clue about what "socialism" is.
8521 2018-06-29 19:28:17 It’s also worth noting that Sweden and Norway funded generous social programs through oil exploration & exporting in the North Sea — much like Venezuela. Socialist economies and railing against the environmental impacts of oil companies are not compatible.

8528 2018-06-29 19:27:22 My research tells me that Trumps has made sure to give ISIS access into Iran and retain their position Syria. Wonder what'll be discussed at the Trump-Putin summit. Oil is a primary interest of his because those backing him need their assets to grow and for that they need ISIS.

8534 2018-06-29 19:26:53 MLs posting the photo of an American flag flying next to a Rojava one make me roll my eyes so hard

They typically recognize imperialism screws up revolutions

They want "self-determination" but don't like Kurds selling oil to us

The USSR and US were literally allies in WWII

8536 2018-06-29 19:26:48 Poison Ivy. Technu soap will get rid of the oil , Urushiol. Dont scratch or it will spread by attaching to your fingers and the next thing you touch will have the oil on it.
8537 2018-06-29 19:26:46 ya barber shape you up with a bottle of baby oil and a wooden stake
8538 2018-06-29 19:26:41 Without oil nothing will be like Nigeria  ...but soon very soon the owner of the oil will come and overtake he's property.
8539 2018-06-29 19:26:20 We've been hearing for days that @forestservice is going to issue a decision this week on oil drilling and fracking in the Ruby Mountains. Are they waiting until 4pm Friday to dump the news on us because they know how unpopular their decision will be?
8540 2018-06-29 19:26:18 That rare moment when thanks to a coupon plus credit card cashback, a car dealership oil change is not only cheaper than the cheapest Groupon, but also cheaper than the retail price of the materials + DIY.  Thanks @HollerClassic @Honda!
8541 2018-06-29 19:25:55 This heat is terrible but a solution to staying cool is as simple as peppermint oil on the back of your neck cools you down instantly 
8542 2018-06-29 19:25:49 I wondered - thought that was oil!!!
8543 2018-06-29 19:25:46 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
8544 2018-06-29 19:25:37 I want to start a private school that requires students to learn practical life skills like how to change a tire/oil, taxes, how to budget, cook, how mortgages work, insurance, etc.
8545 2018-06-29 19:25:31 U.S. oil prices settle with a first half of the year gain of more than 20%
8546 2018-06-29 19:25:27 I hate the cities.. 
1) There are too many people and I feel like I can’t move 
2) No one is as friendly as small town people 
3) No one lets me in when I need to change lanes 
4) No place takes appointments for oil changes and I am currently waiting 2 hours for an oil change

8550 2018-06-29 19:25:06 Interesting supposition; if trump is successful in ordering countries to cease buying oil from Iran, Russia is the benefactor. Russia economy relies on oil for influx of money. Is trump again acting for Putin?
8551 2018-06-29 19:24:57 What is not true exactly?
What where the real reasons for toppling either Saddam or Gaddafi?

These regime changes where certainly not for any humanitarian reasons, nor for the benefit the people of either Iraq or Libya.

Power, control, oil & money!
& of course the Petrodollar!

8575 2018-06-29 19:22:19 In mind seeing an episode of Columbo years ago. If you rub (I think it was) castor oil inside the end of an exhaust pipe it'll bellow black smoke. Save all that pissing about. 
8576 2018-06-29 19:22:16 Breaking News....Brent Crude Oil approaches $80 a barrel.
8577 2018-06-29 19:22:13 If I’m doing a hot oil treatment on wash day, that’ll be the first thing I do. But throughout the week i would just do it at night so my hair was usually dry & twisted up.
8578 2018-06-29 19:22:12 Me too! Have a BA in Art History and my Teaching Certification in Fine Arts. Do you like oil painting? 
8579 2018-06-29 19:22:10 Yup! Widowed ex-US military who are now working in the oil industry seem to be magnetically drawn to befriend me on FB.

8582 2018-06-29 19:21:55 I dress with a simple olive oil and lemon juice, salt and pepper dressing;  I use this on all my vegetable and salads...it just can't be beat.  1/3 part lemon juice or vinegar to 2/3 part oil. Plenty of salt and pepper.
8583 2018-06-29 19:21:42 UGH they are all sold out!
I can't believe it so close...but still  no vegan burgers! I LOVE the Sunshine Burgers (I'm WFPB and they have NO oil!)
8584 2018-06-29 19:21:42 -Nuts: Almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, etc.

-Grains: Whole grains like oats and brown rice.
8585 2018-06-29 19:21:24 The volume of depredations from Trump and Co. reminds me of a James Bond car spraying oil out the back to make anyone following skid off the road.

8595 2018-06-29 19:20:22 That should say BOIL NOT OIL
8596 2018-06-29 19:20:12 Yep. There’s a contrast in how the US govt responded to the BP oil spill vs. Dow in Bhopal. And yes, Central India pollution, enabled by govt dilutions/deliberate weakening of Adivasi laws. Wrt climate, developing vs. developed world is at the heart of enviro justice debates.
8597 2018-06-29 19:19:23 what were you doing with a pair of scissors and a bowl of fish oil??? 
8598 2018-06-29 19:19:20 The oil pump changed on my new motor in my suburban and all is well. 
 Now to break it in.
Praise the Lord.
8599 2018-06-29 19:19:17 Because nobody stopped Obama from taking that land.   Perhaps our land here in the southwest has oil that Obama didn't want anyone finding out about?

8605 2018-06-29 19:18:41 Yes, in this time Putin will 

- Sieze more land and resources across Europe
- Even more control of EU politicians to create social chaos and assure fracking never occurs in EU
- Eventually ban US oil/gas imports to EU
-Russian military bases in Baltics, Ukraine, Belarus

8607 2018-06-29 19:18:24 Enyewe, Kabila has checked out of DRC, he is allowing drilling for oil in the Virunga, home of the mountain gorilla. 
8608 2018-06-29 19:18:23 , i refuse to honor special bulletin offering a free oil change at pep boys.
8609 2018-06-29 19:18:01 Not all vegan food is equal. Are you eating mostly processed, gmo products soaked in unsustainably farmed oil with dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of food miles or are you eating local, whole produce when you can? Let’s always strive to be better vegans
8610 2018-06-29 19:17:46 At least you wont burn it with oil lol
8611 2018-06-29 19:17:46 When people with Trump bumper stickers on their car come to my Jiffy Lube I drain all the oil from their engine and don’t put any back in and then charge them for full synthetic oil.
8612 2018-06-29 19:17:44 Lastly oil up on state dept sanctions, which while helping US capex also dramatically raise risk of trade war.  These 2nd/3rd order effects not well studied/understood
8613 2018-06-29 19:17:38 Evangelicals are a mess - and so many snake oil salesman among them ripping off the most vulnerable.  Some guy is using hashtag q anon, I looked and seems like random crazy right wing paranoia stuff - what is that all about if u know. Just curious.
8614 2018-06-29 19:17:20 You guys. Please do not put coconut oil on your face. That’s a breakout waiting to snatch your dignity.
8615 2018-06-29 19:17:14 Mikey would put his body on the line BUT ships stopped burning whale oil long ago.

8620 2018-06-29 19:16:51 And my dentist isn’t doing anything to fix the oil filter on my car, but then again, that’s not his job.
8621 2018-06-29 19:16:51 Capex heavily oil rise.  Oil rise heavily state dept driven. Don’t need big fall in risk, just need Risk to stop rising for it to hurt US Consumption - see ATL Fed revision today off weaker PCE.

8643 2018-06-29 19:13:45 @timseymour Tim, your own show promo'ed Gartman 100 times saying oil would never be over $50-$60 in our lifetime. I never heard you saying he was dead wrong. Own up to it man

8645 2018-06-29 19:13:17 Is it oil or gold that they have found under the soil of Palestine? What is worth paying with all these innocent lives that they risk earning the tears of their own prophets? Born of hate and contempt Banksterism has betrayed its delinquency in spite of itself.

8663 2018-06-29 19:11:13 I believe this will be good for jobs, while under construction then again when dismantling after failure, good for oil companies, lots of transportation and manufacturing spin-off also. Not so good for the Taxpayers who will end up footing the bill for the whole boondoggle.
8664 2018-06-29 19:11:11 Interesting how the Iran nuclear sanctions that Trump is planning impose may have less to do with fission & fusion & are more about OPEC & the oil market & Hezbollah & Houthi rockets & Israel & Lebanon & Syria & Qatar & Saudi Arabia & Russia & I am almost out of characters ...

8700 2018-06-29 19:06:34 I hate doing things like this... I need an oil change app.

8703 2018-06-29 19:06:19 Horse/oxen/mule based transportation system very land intensive. (They got to eat!) Coal and oil? Not so much. Speed from transportation system also puts downward pressure on land values.

8705 2018-06-29 19:06:16 Water in hot oil? Stupid 101!
8706 2018-06-29 19:06:15 It doesn't because you're ignoring the emissions from refining the oil into gasoline. You car has low tail pipe emissions, but #EVs have ZERO tail pipe emissions. So no, your car isn't "basically equivalent".

8719 2018-06-29 19:04:23 @HunterDCJR I can't believe it takes 3.5 hrs for a oil change. I don't think I will go back to you guys even for warranty/repair work.

8738 2018-06-29 19:01:03 E mesmo nesta reportagem que você mandou ela não afirma que foi um mal negócio. Ela afirma que se tornou um mal negócio devido às crise Mundial e desmente esta história que a Petrobras pagou dez vezes mais por Pasadena que a Astra Oil. Leia o que você mesmo mandou.
8739 2018-06-29 19:00:59 ....breaks out the massage oil.......... or tanning oil, , I got both...
8740 2018-06-29 19:00:54 Secondly you said my economics is not good then please tell me why in all sectors exports are in minus and imports are higher. The import export balance decides the currency strength. And you might be knowing when modiji came in to power crude oil price was 40$ per barrel

8749 2018-06-29 19:00:17 Since the royals are fully onto the diversity bandwagon & pushing it with all their might, sadly I doubt they'll be crossing swords with globalist causes of pandering to minorities, powerful entities/brokers & mega rich oil sheiks intent on Islamizing Europe. #NWO #Agenda2030

8752 2018-06-29 19:00:00 Want to know why you should change your oil consistently?
1. Maintains engine reliability
2. Cools engine components
3. Removes engine wear particles
4.Improves gas mileage
5.Promotes vehicle longevity

Come on in today and we'll take of you in no time!
8753 2018-06-29 18:59:59 Just a oil change?!!
8754 2018-06-29 18:59:54 Nothing better than watching Daniels mom lather him with coconut oil before he leaves
8755 2018-06-29 18:59:54 How much money does he have invested into "sustainable" energy? That is the real question. They are jamming this down our throats & we don't want it. We have volumes of natural resources in our country ready to use. I 100% support coal, gas, oil, etc. Solar & wind aren't working
8756 2018-06-29 18:59:45 hows the lard mining , thats the important thing , real Scots dont care about oil , oven chips are lethal weapons - and dentist agent bastards.
8757 2018-06-29 18:59:33 Today I learned you can make box mix brownies with butter instead of vegetable oil. 
As someone who currently has butter and not oil and really wants brownies... this was a revelation of a life time.

8760 2018-06-29 18:59:03 Getting GREAT results as a MOSQUITO & BUG GUARD w/ just 3 essential oils: SPEARMINT, TEA TREE, & LEMONGRASS - 
Use a carrier oil if used directly on skin. Video coming soon!
8761 2018-06-29 18:58:59 I use Argon oil for my hair and nails and any dry skin for eczema stuff! It’s about $25 for a bottle but it lasts for months!  It’s super hydrating for summer especially but idk if I’d use it on my face. Rose water though you can’t go wrong.
8762 2018-06-29 18:58:51 Best essential oil to use when kids are screaming... dog is barking n u are about to close on a house!!! Aka the chill me fast type of oil????
8763 2018-06-29 18:58:49 The entire Democrat Party runs like one big Nigerian crude oil scam.
8764 2018-06-29 18:58:40 damn an oil spill?? :/
8765 2018-06-29 18:58:22 Curbs on H1B visas, sanctions under CAATSA for weapons procurement, case  in WTO against minimum support prices in agriculture, tariffs against  Indian commodities and restrictions on oil from Iran. Wonder what will we get  at 'the next level of India-US ties'?
8766 2018-06-29 18:58:21 Expanding offshore oil drilling in I’m extremely proud of the women and God
8767 2018-06-29 18:58:14 Absolutely. This was a fundamental mistake from day 1. The EU is not negotiating. It’s a rules-based organisation. What an embarrassment to see our snake oil salesmen trying to haggle for a deal.
8768 2018-06-29 18:58:03 No. Due to oil Texas as a state will not even notice the death of nafta. EPI had a report in 2003 that covered econ impact from various industries. Unfortunately no 1 has done similar research since then.
8769 2018-06-29 18:57:54 Apparently, the Lemongrass Ché Balm helps with his muscle pain.  and this is coming from a CBD Oil user.
8770 2018-06-29 18:57:48 I bit the bullet and took my car for an oil change. I know you were all concerned 
8771 2018-06-29 18:57:42 Oil revenue is already included (there is no ...extra). Even if there were, does not mean QC should b exempt of including $3 Billion in Hydro NET revenue ( not including discount rate they give residence which further reduces their income capacity).
8772 2018-06-29 18:57:42 (Your not allowed to laugh) do you use tanning oil? I wanna get brawwwwwzzzz when I go away
8773 2018-06-29 18:57:41 well. one of you is right. 
I suggest you both lather up in oil and have a wrestle on College Green.
8774 2018-06-29 18:57:35 Pretty sure it was an AR shotgun. Weapons grade. Can also be used to detonate nuclear weapons. Why are free Americans allowed to purchase WMDs???
8775 2018-06-29 18:57:33 US President Trump: Modi can lie to indian public, but lying to me is no acceptable. Modi: yes sir. Trump: India will stop buying oil from Iran. Modi: yes sir. (in private) please dont cancel my us visa after 2019.
8776 2018-06-29 18:57:19 $HUSA $CEI these two stocks are literal neighbors in Houston...both oil based and in the lime light. With oil up and world news pushing towards US production+supply the logic says these should still creep up even after their big days yesterday Oil is up they should follow.

8779 2018-06-29 18:57:00 people are dying in Nigeria n d govt are yet to do sumtin abt it. This fuel or crude oil we are talking should not be transported by road it should be by sea or underground. Our govt know all dis they just don't wanna do it. God will save us from bad govt.
8780 2018-06-29 18:56:57 This is the longest I’ve ever waited for an oil change.. really guys? An hour  pulled up to speedee oil before and they have me out in literally 10 mins
8781 2018-06-29 18:56:56 See what happens is because my car takes dexco full synthetic 6 qts of oil, yall price was 69ish!  Walmart Is 50! But I did try
8782 2018-06-29 18:56:55 Forgot about that too! Even though I still see it all the time!  Either Dawn was in wide usage on animals prior to oil spills, or wildlife rescuers gave vets the idea.
8783 2018-06-29 18:56:55 For those interested I do use a spray of TeeTree oil and water for ninor injuries.
I also found it helpful after the NHS had screwed up my Wife's leg Ulcers to ease infection but don't tell them.
Only when they used Cucumin on her leg did the Ulcers finally go.

He talks to a man that is supplying cannabis oil to an ex-police officer and a father who lost his son through a lethal strength skunk that wants regulation so that, like alcohol, you know the strength of the ingredient.

8791 2018-06-29 18:56:30 may they strip him of his medical licence. May the parents of dead infants infected by unvaccinated kids sue the crap out of him. Until these snake oil salesmen feel it financially there is no change.
8792 2018-06-29 18:56:22 Iran will like the higher oil prices for more profit.

8800 2018-06-29 18:55:21 @CroftHelima Hi Helima I just saw you on Power Lunch on CNBC I am so happy to have seen you. You are totally awesome I love the way you explained the oil situation. Fantastic I am now your #1 fan I learned so much. I will be following you on Twitter. thank you take care Fred 
8801 2018-06-29 18:55:13 I’m staring at Energy equities on my screen that were >30% higher earlier this yr vs where they’re trading at today..oil prices are at similar level & the backdrop of the fundamental picture appears to have significantly improved for long-term investors..Am I hallucinating? #OOTT
8802 2018-06-29 18:54:55 Don't try to judge my right to choose even though Republicans are paid heavily by the oil industry. This is probably the most stupid political argument, I wanted and have one, if you like not knowing how much gasoline will cost from week to week be my guest, don't judge me?
8803 2018-06-29 18:54:49 Oil should be a blessing not a curse. The leadership & the oil company in Turkana should angage the locals in meaningful dialogue to agree on way forward. Power play will not work. The resource should be seen to benefit the locals and environment.
8804 2018-06-29 18:54:40 It wasn't a joke. U said a very right thing. Isn't government earning from its own companies viz. Oil primarily, banking and what not. Good governance will surely make such reforms to ease out taxman burden.
8805 2018-06-29 18:54:28 I ordered some CBD Oil and should receive it by July 3rd. It’s supposed to help with anxiety and weight loss..  I’ve lost 12# so far....hoping to lose 28 more. Will keep you updated! 
8806 2018-06-29 18:54:22 This tweet wins the day. 
Only something so entirely stupid could me smile.
8807 2018-06-29 18:54:18 There’s also the dead cat I buried where they dug up the neighbour’s oil tank. There was also a dismembered cat corpse on the corner a few years ago. We weren’t sure if it was from a crazy neighbour or a coyote. Lots of ghosts here.
8808 2018-06-29 18:54:14 Make sure you stick your finger in the hole, it may feel slippery from excess oil but it works better when you shoot it.

8813 2018-06-29 18:53:45 Sanctions against Iran are said to  push oil prices to $90. For RSA, this means that the possibility of petrol rising above R18/l over the next 3-4 months is pretty high. And there's nothing anybody can do about it.
8814 2018-06-29 18:53:31 I admire your optimism, but seeing public lands leased for mining and drilling oil & gas at Bears Ears & Grand Staircase Escalate N.M.s, knowing Trump & Zinke's plans and Sweeney's past, they all want to drill in the Arctic. We will see.

8825 2018-06-29 18:52:10 Oil becoming an issue up here. About 60c higher a gallon from last year now as per AAA. Definitely a drag on the consumer and seriously annoying to folks at the pump every few days.

8832 2018-06-29 18:51:26 Our CPP, which we pay for, should not be used to try and claim political points! Most of my contributions came from the oil industry so a bit hypocritical if you invest my share in renewable energy, don’t ya think?

8838 2018-06-29 18:50:10 Not so the excessive corporation tax burden non oil industry reduced significantly
8839 2018-06-29 18:50:06 I believe that we might see a slight improvement in the real world for steady state cruise but I don't believe that it will be anywhere near the 21% improvement stated earlier. The system cuts off oil pressure to the lifter but the parts are still moving.
8840 2018-06-29 18:50:01 I'm a rigger. Oh, so you work on oil rigs? No I rig the system at the expense of working families. I rig laws to make it harder for working people to form unions and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions. How can so few control so many? #scotus
8841 2018-06-29 18:49:39 Everyone is hitting us with tariffs, prices are going up. Real wages are going down due to inflation caused in part by surging oil prices exacerbated by Iran boycott. If that's winning I dont want to see what losing looks like
8842 2018-06-29 18:49:34 what I heard is foreign companies in joint ventures with NOC will still export their loads in east. They get percentage of oil produced and sell that oil,  rather than getting percentage of each barrel exported. NOC east says wants normal ops, but Libya revenue paid to new bank.
8843 2018-06-29 18:49:29 In the next three weeks i need to get:

8845 2018-06-29 18:49:10 yes, sure. also if we look at the fact that commercial mayo is made with less eggs than oil the amount of egg was probably almost negligible.

8852 2018-06-29 18:48:00 I have some because of Mason and yeah I use it because it’s gentle and I don’t breakout as much with it! Then a rose water witch hazel, tea tree oil as spot treatment, and aloe vera or baby lotion as moisturizer!!
8853 2018-06-29 18:47:42 That is a big issue... People just dont care.
But big oil and corporations are an issue, we just cant fight two battles if we dont have access to a cheaper alt to plastic thats well established.

8865 2018-06-29 18:46:20 We're not socialists. Please do some research. Social democracy =/= socialism. Two of our main sources of national income is trading in oil and exported goods. We're wealthy because we're capitalists, not because we believe in never-ending fairy money like socialists do.

8870 2018-06-29 18:46:08 i thought argon oil was agave for a bit
8871 2018-06-29 18:45:58 Quite wrong. Crude oil, gold, iron, copper, coffee, diamonds, cotton, tea, petroleum/natural gas…Africa currently possesses 30% of the planet’s remaining mineral resources. All of that plundered since the beginning of the colonial era.

8876 2018-06-29 18:45:27 Should be yesterday. Canada needs alternative markets right now. If China puts a tariff on US oil could be important to the Canadian economy. Right now US sends $1b a month to China.

8891 2018-06-29 18:44:40 I agree with you on gas tax, it’s a regressive tax. Let’s remove the $4 billion a year in government subsidies to big oil instead.
8892 2018-06-29 18:44:36 Just buy the oil and filter and i got a guy for you.
8893 2018-06-29 18:44:31 I just noticed that as well.
8894 2018-06-29 18:44:28 @mathewi enjoyed your chat on TWiG. I pumped gas too! The smell of gas and oil makes me nostalgic every time.
8895 2018-06-29 18:44:12 As we hurl insults and wonder why other ports are not used to import petroleum products, guess whose company took the FG to court for trying to open up other ports for different use other than crude oil 
8896 2018-06-29 18:44:10 Third world sh!t nationalizing an oil pipeline! Now will probably need another billion in repairs and a further environmental study
8897 2018-06-29 18:44:07 It's the oil
8898 2018-06-29 18:44:04 Gun oil's silicone stuff, Pjur, and this stuff i got in Japan called Mr. PePe. Amazingly thick n doesn't dry out. Water-based too.

8904 2018-06-29 18:43:44 Oh good.   Another way we can sell our oil at a 25% discount.

8906 2018-06-29 18:43:36  Oil prices ROSE to over $74.00 a barrel on the Stock Exchange today. While Wall Dt. is gleeful about this, the average American will feel the effect at the Gas Pump, and in higher prices in the Fall/Winter for home heating prices. Expect $80.00 by Sept. or before.

8910 2018-06-29 18:43:23 Two questions

2.  Is Donald a good father to you?

8913 2018-06-29 18:43:17 First find a non oil based EVERYTHING.  Use warm water to moisten .  Follow with cleanser (I use a foam cleanser since its nicer to skin), and wash off with cool water.  Then use a toner (apply in upward strokes!!!) And then oil free moisturizer.  The same thing at night.

8933 2018-06-29 18:41:42 You think? Bernie didn’t bother voting until he was 39 years old and could vote for himself. Such a great civil rights activist that he spent the 60s and 70s not bothering to vote and white flighting to Vermont. What a snake oil farce his movement was in 2016.

8941 2018-06-29 18:41:01 I always forget about Groupon. I just paid $35 for a $80 oil change! 
8942 2018-06-29 18:40:59 I think you're wrong about what Canada produces. The one thing I'm sure about is that everyone loses in a trade war. Not sure why we're still sending out oil to the US.
8943 2018-06-29 18:40:55 most of these city folk are inhaling toxins from the rain soaking your antifreeze and oil stained streets. try being out in the desert during a rainstorm. Or the mountains. That’s the scent of rain. Lol

8955 2018-06-29 18:39:43 and yet, trump endorsed their behaviour and keeps a deviding hateful rhetoric every single day. your country is deeply devided on several issues and he is throwing oil into the fire. mighty fine president. but half of your country will never be reconciled with him or his ideals.
8956 2018-06-29 18:39:39 Doesnt work for me haha. I’ve tried literally everything but castor oil which I didn’t want to try. But I also don’t want to get induced. So we’ll see what happens

8965 2018-06-29 18:38:57 Should be an adult and go get my oil changed but I hate that I’m trapped in my car and they sit there and talk to me and also try to upsell me on filters.
8966 2018-06-29 18:38:47 It's kinda nice having an auto parts store like literally at the end of the road. I got motor oil even though my garage door is currently very broken.

8968 2018-06-29 18:38:16 Extreme weather is a result of climate change. Scientists have been talking about it for 40 years, but the corporate media can't report on it because they share board members with big oil.

8974 2018-06-29 18:37:15 A refinery should be constructed in turkana and the the by product which has more value exported and distributed amongst the locals. It's absurd that we are still importing crude oil while we have our own being transported by logistic indian cartel

8977 2018-06-29 18:36:49 Climate change was a complete hoax up to ,and only until after, the pipeline was allowed. 3 times the greenhouse gases produced from oil sand production. By-product so toxic only India will take it. But what's really important is that billionaire Koch makes more money, right?
8978 2018-06-29 18:36:37 Thought this was new tax rule and they were buying fuel oil and got caught.  From HFIR or A. Bradley on a chat for the source.  It’s no drop in demand though.
8979 2018-06-29 18:36:29 Why dint u wait for a few months??If everyone is NOT backing down,india wont either,but this probably rhetoric,when time comes they will stop all import of oil

8983 2018-06-29 18:36:03 I don’t know where the account went but on Twitter a few years ago someone kept describing scenarios of Bruce Willis being covered in tanning oil & slithering off lawn chairs and such etc. I wish I could find it, it was good fun. Or wait was it Nick Cage?
8984 2018-06-29 18:36:02 It's very nuanced. What's happening in Venezuela isn't because everyone has healthcare it's because the economy had no backbone. Too much reliance on oil.

8997 2018-06-29 18:35:02 honest question is it big oil and corporations, or just general lack of concern from everyone else? 

I avoid straws, and plastic silverware, talk to others about it, and they don't have a level of concern to change their behavior.

9004 2018-06-29 18:34:37 BTW, Trump is expanding the military, bombing Syria, aligning w North Korea, and drilling oil and mining coal throughout the US, all of which hurts Russia directly.

9015 2018-06-29 18:33:23 I’ve tried EVERYTHING, and just switched to all natural (cheap) routine and it’s amazing: wash face with a bar of olive oil soap & a muslin cloth, then top with organic cold pressed jojoba oil. And a natural Australian clay mask. And I have sensitive oily cystic skin x
9016 2018-06-29 18:33:19 Cities already tax utilities, car tabs etc - all required for electric & ride sharing vehicles. Also huge increases in property tax with real estate boom. Time for them to be more efficient w/ public transport. If oil & auto companies must reinvent; so must cities.

9023 2018-06-29 18:32:17 1 cup of coconut oil. Pure Aloevera Pieces(1 bowl). And you just heat it in a pot on the stove for 15-20 minutes and that will be the outcome.

9028 2018-06-29 18:31:47 No the opposit is true, if theres no money in the economy who puts it in? Investment leaves, wages remain low, where is the money for the economy. Thats like saying don't put oil in your car when the engines about to seize up.

9072 2018-06-29 18:26:41 I don't know a lot about the situation in Venezuela, but I can still figure out that socialism had nothing to do with it. They had a crash due to the oil market crashing in like 2014 or whatever. So you could make the case that it's capitalism's instability that led them here.

9084 2018-06-29 18:25:03 Hmm. Ok. I'm watching oil closely bc I think that's been a big driver of USD strength. It's a positve feedback loop for U.S. mkt (negative for EM) bc our economy is so levered to energy now vs. 3/5/7 years ago.
9085 2018-06-29 18:24:56 @realDonaldTrump For myself, I do draw the line at using FRACKING water for Agriculture, in search of oil, is not safe!  The Fracking pressure of water required, forces out minerals,

9139 2018-06-29 18:19:41 that's the concern. Sarir and Misla are collectively Libya's biggest producers. The oil is sticky and it they cut production the balance sits in the pipe and congeals.

9141 2018-06-29 18:19:29 That will never happen. Trump would never piss off Saudi Arabia. For starters: SA owns +/- $117 billion in U.S. treasuries, and who knows how much in private investments. The U.S. is dependent on SA for oil (it's #2 after Canada). Trump appears to have business ties in SA. Etc.
9142 2018-06-29 18:19:21 Yes but I only eat the things I know bother me every now and again so at least I enjoy them. I still have to avoid garlic so I use garlic oil.

9149 2018-06-29 18:18:52 Oil change is taking too long.
9150 2018-06-29 18:18:41 Just proves you haven’t been paying attention. Countries are already opting to use local currencies for trade as well as sell oil for gold. Nothing happens over night, everything is gradual. 70 years is nothing, Russia has cities that are three times as old as the united states.
9151 2018-06-29 18:18:11 It is only in Nigeria that petroleum products are transported by roads thereby wrecking havocs. Alternatively, in advanced oil producing environments, petroleum products are conveyed by rails, water channels and pipelines. Nigerian government doesn't value human lives.

9159 2018-06-29 18:17:17 You can since it grows the economy, and even more so now since @realDonaldTrump is much smarter and/or more patriotic than @BarackObama since Trump also ...

- cut regulations so a barrel of oil that used to cost $60 to get out of the ground now costs $40
- set #TrumpTariffs

9174 2018-06-29 18:15:47 Basically. The checks & balances in Nigeria crumbled when they found oil. All of a sudden the salary incentive to do your job was engulfed by the possibility of huge illegitimate gains. When you're able to say fuck everything with no repercussions what you end up with is Nigeria

9176 2018-06-29 18:15:42 Dani we should just throw Kermit in the oven, sprinkle some olive oil and roast em. Cuz we all know how tasty roasted greens are 
9177 2018-06-29 18:15:39 If you're trying to remain celibate or reach a certain target, then stay focused. But if you've just been having a dry year for no real reason lol, then it's time to oil the pipes 
9178 2018-06-29 18:15:32 Sorry for the inconvenience with the construction please horse trailers go all the way south turn left then on oil then left again.  Spectators first left and wind around
9179 2018-06-29 18:15:31 She and the democrats benefit from the Mexican Cartels bring drugs, sex trafficking, and now the cartels are selling oil. ICE interferes with this.

9183 2018-06-29 18:15:05 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
9184 2018-06-29 18:14:53 I pay higher taxes, neighbours and friends can’t get oil sector jobs, real estate prices are soft here....my kids have less so people here illegally can have free stuff. You throw out the term ‘racist’ like you have a clue what you’re talking about.  You don’t.
9185 2018-06-29 18:14:47 i ran over something and while driving the van this morning....when i got out some kinda liquid was leaking...it wasnt oil nor was it the coolant. fml i think it was water.  lajimmas gonna kill me guys ! im so scared ! FMLLL
9186 2018-06-29 18:14:42 We survived but products from Common Market such as olive oil and vegetables were very expensive. (Olive oil was sold at chemist's in tiny bottles. For your ears.)
9187 2018-06-29 18:14:35 Let's not forget trillions wort of subsidies into oil industry in order to keep it cheap in order to keep cars anyhow profitable. Without those subsidies Tesla and EV's would not need anything rather than manufacture something
9188 2018-06-29 18:14:09 A swimming pool and a box of pizza and the smell of tanning oil are the best days

9192 2018-06-29 18:13:26 I’m currently air drying. I’ll evaluate when I blow dry and then drench edges in castor oil.
9193 2018-06-29 18:13:24 this is so, so poweful, ice, you did such an amazing job
its oil pain, right?
9194 2018-06-29 18:13:12 Waiting to get my oil and AC charged in my car. AC doesn’t work. It’s a 20 min wait. I might die from a heat stroke.
9195 2018-06-29 18:13:06 Consequences; all major oil producers using the affected terminals have no choice but to stop production & that include Wintershall Mellitah Harouge Sirte AGOCO etc.
Also fields producing mainly Gas used by GECOLE will eventually have to stop (wells produce gas&crude together)
9196 2018-06-29 18:12:56 What about free shavers, shaving foam, shaving oil beard wax, etc? Oh, & so’s not to discriminate against those with a reaction to wet shaves, free Braun shavers (maybe Phillips, now, actually). Or what about vouchers for the Turkish Barbers?
9197 2018-06-29 18:12:37 odd, would expect all or none. 3 PCs here all getting the page. btw, how about that Gulf of Mexico oil and gas... dropping like a rock

9200 2018-06-29 18:11:49 The only problem is #Khartoum never wanted a peaceful #SouthSudan, for obvious reasons, but the current economic crisis might have made them change their hearts, literally they are benefiting more from SouthSudan's oil than ourselves. So the bottom line is, economic interests
9201 2018-06-29 18:11:37 Ordered a @mymonq essential oil pen and I L O V E it. I got the “forest” blend which smells (and tastes) so yum and it’s so soothing

9203 2018-06-29 18:11:09 Ran out of tanning oil so I used olive oil today...is that smart? Maybe not. Does it work really well? Oh yes.
9204 2018-06-29 18:10:58 Yeah, I've seen a few of the names (zeves and hellzerk) before, but I'm sure you cooked up the rest in a Norwegian lab (obviously paid for with North Sea oil money).
9205 2018-06-29 18:10:56 Mm, nice. 
Mine is:lemon juice or flavoured vinegar, mustard, Kosher salt
mix well then whisk in olive oil until desired texture. 
I have a bag of dried Italian seasoning which i can add, or not.
9206 2018-06-29 18:10:48 all information useful at this stage. Keep it coming. Its a very fragmented picture, so good to hear what oil buyers are hearing.
9207 2018-06-29 18:10:45 Haha I've only changed my own oil once. It was when I worked at a shady buy-here-pay-here dealer and they let me get my car on the lift. Otherwise it is annoyingly messy for such a small task haha.
9208 2018-06-29 18:10:31 Obama and his cohorts, Clinton included favor using children to oil their war machine over Trumps separation policy

9210 2018-06-29 18:10:19 A one time bonus doesn't begin to even what they got!!!  Oil companies received a BIG tacit and went up on the price of gas and made more money.  Our little tax cut was gone plus some with the high price of gas.  When are you going say something about the gas prices

9222 2018-06-29 18:09:05 #Crude oil Outside key reversal on the monthly chart will give it plenty of nuts to run up the next couple months. Strong signal. Also closing at the high on the quarterly chart just as bullish.

Is this how you do it or? Also in the morning what do you do?

9228 2018-06-29 18:08:30 @marcorubio that’s what I thought Matt. This country is so screwed and he’s playing the offended schoolmarm. He should just buy a fishing boat and take tourists out until the oil clouds the water.
9229 2018-06-29 18:08:21 $SAEX 1.595 Avg after $GBR run this gets over 1.85 we have an oil runner off $GBR but have not seen a huge continuation in $SAEX yet seems
9230 2018-06-29 18:08:00 I made the argument that we not only need Dems, we need quality Dems with backbones and courage, and I got blasted for trying to divide the party. But we do. Dems that support big oil, big banks, and approve all of Trump's nominees aren't helpful.
9231 2018-06-29 18:07:46 I’m ok. Yeah the police came. The other driver refused to give me their info. So now I have to wait for the police report to be filed. I was just giving my co-worker a lift back to the office cuz she dropped her car off for an oil change! 
9232 2018-06-29 18:07:42 You have to commit to join the euro at a future date, the date is unspecified. Given Scotland has strong tangible assets to borrow against I think we will be fine. As for the rump uk, without oil as security for borrowing they will be in trouble. What else do they have?
9233 2018-06-29 18:07:41 I slept in so late today  i could’ve been out enjoying the weather but instead here I am getting an oil change

9242 2018-06-29 18:06:47 Right now it's real tough to trade crude on options side so I have been sitting out and focusing on GC.  Until there is a flattening topping plateau that allows for Oil Vix to collapse & premiums to narrow, it's just not a good R/R from options standpoint.  $80 res TL is max top
9243 2018-06-29 18:06:37 Great that crack oil lol 
9244 2018-06-29 18:06:36 yes. the oil that comes with sundried tomatoes are extremely tasty
9245 2018-06-29 18:06:33 Ugh... About 80% of canola oil is produced from genetically modified plants. I prefer olive oil and peanut oil.
9246 2018-06-29 18:06:29 Some people complain about their T zone being oily. Bitch every surface area of my face is oily. I wouldn’t be surprised if my eyeballs secrete oil too
9247 2018-06-29 18:06:25 We off the oil tonight?
9248 2018-06-29 18:05:52 1) add a splash of acid - vinegar (something light, not balsamic), lemon juice, lime juice. 2) spices - literally anything you want. I dig a little sea salt, black pepper, and crushed chili flakes. 3) a splash of good olive oil in the mash.
9249 2018-06-29 18:05:50 As in you use dried tomatoes to infuse the oil?

That's kinda like the dried tomatoes in oil. I always keep those for salads.

9288 2018-06-29 18:01:21 OMG Will, close this deal. Would have to likely drop your selfie side business, but that’s an easyyyy call lol
9289 2018-06-29 18:00:53 chega na morena e fala, cê é a peça de pakista que faltava na minha oil slick pad...
9290 2018-06-29 18:00:52 But eliminate grains. Beans can get too carby. Stay away from seed oils, only use olive and cocunut oil. Keep checking those labels.
9291 2018-06-29 18:00:46 It only took me 10kiles over to get my oil changed i need to adult better...
9292 2018-06-29 18:00:41 New obsession: olive oil drizzled feta cheese with a pinch of sea salt and mint.
9293 2018-06-29 18:00:38 You probably live in your mother's basement and as such are impervious to such considerations as earning a living or paying for costly, misguided policies based on pseudoscientific snake oil.
9294 2018-06-29 18:00:32 @PhilBryantMS Congrats on @realDonaldTrump mentioning U N today’s speech. ppl of MS who have cancer pain,severe RA pain would b helped100% if only u wud sponsor bill: approve MEDICAL CBD oil for us.  There is NO HIGH, Not addictive, & it helpsW/Pain. Help US!
9295 2018-06-29 18:00:29 Trouble is the oil needs to stay in the ground....

9300 2018-06-29 18:00:04 they dont make a lot of sense in a place as spread out as Indy. You're not going to need to fight traffic very often. For the bro living 2 miles away from Lucas Oil it would be a god send on game day

9303 2018-06-29 17:59:42 yes ofcourse they not asked DE about it
knetz already forget so they don't want to give some more oil to the small fire right lol
9304 2018-06-29 17:59:38 Defend it by building those pipelines you will need a lot of steel and will create jobs for the steel workers. And will make transport of oil much safer and generate wealth for Canadians.
9305 2018-06-29 17:59:36 lol he's using his laser vision to seal up an OIL tanker, that whole ship blows up the second he start closing it
9306 2018-06-29 17:59:33 He is a ufa he was traded for assets if he want to he can go back The oil or didn't want to lose him for nothing so they traded
9307 2018-06-29 17:59:15 The Gulf States can't have a post oil economy with an unstable Middle East.
9308 2018-06-29 17:58:38 Reward companies who use environmentally friendly, recyclable materials & tax companies using plastic
 More imp the govt shd stop investing in crude oil used in producing plastic. Buying #TransMountain pipeline show us how interested Canadian govt really is in the environment 
9309 2018-06-29 17:58:24 Getting this oil change
9310 2018-06-29 17:58:22 WTI Crude and Brent oil are up +1.09% and +2.05% today respectively
9311 2018-06-29 17:58:18 Took Pepper to the vet this am and the assistant was wearing sooo much patchouli oil that now PEPPER actually smells like it. FML  #worstsmellever
9312 2018-06-29 17:58:17 Avocado oil would do the trick.
9313 2018-06-29 17:58:15 Can’t wait for the day I can tell my husband “the car need a oil change” and he takes it in or changes it himself.
9314 2018-06-29 17:58:14 Watch out for her pre-nup
9315 2018-06-29 17:58:10 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to withstand the harsh conditions of these fields.
9316 2018-06-29 17:58:09 Oil & gears, burps & farts and thoughts & prayers all accomplish the same here.
9317 2018-06-29 17:58:06 Yeah, draining the old oil, changing the filter and putting in fresh oil!!!
9318 2018-06-29 17:58:06 palm oil being bad for the environment while also being a cameroonian staple is so anti black
9319 2018-06-29 17:58:04 He may even thrown in 2 free oil changes
9320 2018-06-29 17:57:56 Yeap, I make my own too. I particularly like dry tomato oil. Sweet sweet umami bomb.
9321 2018-06-29 17:57:55 You could of fooled me cause it looks shiny and healthy af!!! Let me come there and rub coconut oil on it

9324 2018-06-29 17:57:15 @drsanjaygupta Please, Dr. Gupta, can you tell us, me, Is CBD oil safe for stroke recovery? Does it yield increase risk of strokes, decrease risk, have or no known effect? Thank you! #strokesurvivors
9325 2018-06-29 17:57:04 I have genuinely packed a travel bottle of baby oil to bring to Cork to avoid the chub rub
9326 2018-06-29 17:57:04 “Get the oil changed”, is that a euphemism for something? Because if it’s not it should be!
9327 2018-06-29 17:57:03 They refine more oil than they produce within their borders, they can work to increase that volume. Also a dry pipeline hurts us too.
9328 2018-06-29 17:56:56 because they socialized their oil industry and the price of oil was up. Now it's down. Their economy tanked because they tied their entire exports into oil. That's what happens when you make an entire economy depend on one export with an incompetent gov.
9329 2018-06-29 17:56:51 Coconut oil, sporting waves, and this some shit made by fubu lol
9330 2018-06-29 17:56:46 Cameron is OG Original Gammon and I'd guess Phil is too — the real question is whether Phil went full UKIP or just spoiled his ballot with a big streak of Transit van oil

9332 2018-06-29 17:56:38 There's a first for everything. Yesterday, I found myself in the supermarket scrutinizing washing liquid, toilet paper and canola oil to make sure it was Canada made and not imported from US. Empowering and bummer at the same time. #OhCanada #BoycottAmerica #BoycottUSProducts
9333 2018-06-29 17:56:22 Indeed, but easier to put tight oil on lift. We'll have to wait a couple of decades to do the detailed comparisons!
9334 2018-06-29 17:56:20 Coconut oil and a smooth bottle opener 
9335 2018-06-29 17:55:58 Because this inept government does not see oil production as profitable for the economy.
9336 2018-06-29 17:55:57 then came tariffs... a bearish stock market...higher oil prices...and what are the Europeans talking about this weekend?
9337 2018-06-29 17:55:57 my mother in law told me today that I should put some coconut oil on the bags under my eyes.... 
9338 2018-06-29 17:55:49 I took the day off to initially golf, which turned into mowing the lawn, an oil change, inspection sticker, and maybe Bed Bath and Beyond. I don’t know, I don’t know if I’ll have enough time!
9339 2018-06-29 17:55:41 I pick the wrong day to come get a oil change... they takin alday fareal
9340 2018-06-29 17:55:38 Were can I find tanning oil , not banana tan brand something else , plus I’m looking for shimmer and bronze sprays !! #help
9341 2018-06-29 17:55:33 Maybe swapping Coconut oil for unrefined Shea butter for those with oily skin ... Cause they do the same thing but the unrefined shea butter is non-comedogenic so it doesn't block pores.
9342 2018-06-29 17:55:28 if you're just breaking out in rashes and it's nothing beyond that, I would try a more natural route lol the aloe helped with itching immediately. Almond oil helped prevent any scarrin
9343 2018-06-29 17:55:23 I Need My Oil Changed… & I Don’t Mean My Car 
9344 2018-06-29 17:55:22 He’s got the turning speed of a fuckin oil tanker, he’s shit, like most Chelski players.
9345 2018-06-29 17:55:20 Gemini culture is sun protecting ur face/neck w ur life thus having a skin tone that is too pale for most foundations, but having super tan legs bc u coat them in deep tanning oil every single time that u aren't wearing long pants
9346 2018-06-29 17:55:14 Thank you! That's half a bottle of conditioner and a lot of morrocan hair oil 
9347 2018-06-29 17:55:07 Really pleased at the sell SP at 2.15p
Fantastic week
9348 2018-06-29 17:54:58 Not an enemy, but roots of all evil now as oil, gas, minerals, food & soon WATER, supply controlled by wealthy few to manipulate & exploit the many! 
UK must build reservoirs if we are borrowing to house the world's poor!
9349 2018-06-29 17:54:55 Arugula with just olive oil and lemon juice is so good do not sleep
9350 2018-06-29 17:54:55 First off all, we don't want to be self sufficient. We want to export oil. 2nd it cost twice as much to frack than to drill. Saudis dropped the price of oil to 40.00 a barrel to keep US production off. They raised the price lately because Trump sold them weapons.
9351 2018-06-29 17:54:52 Doesn’t Popeyes use peanut oil tho?
9352 2018-06-29 17:54:52 Doug, you’re drinking the Kool-Aid if you think the oil won’t get burned. It’s just hurting our economy not to allow companies to invest in our oil. #WakeUp
9353 2018-06-29 17:54:49 Ain't that a mood
9354 2018-06-29 17:54:48 I’m spilling sauce like it’s oil

9359 2018-06-29 17:54:29 Why is @realDonaldTrump allowing ISIS to remain in Syria? Because that's what the CIA wants. They want it that way.

Russia, Iran, and Syria are fighting away ISIS and all of a sudden the United States of America are backing the Kurds. Great stuff. 

Oil fields > Humanity

9364 2018-06-29 17:54:04 $50 for an oil change and $50 to fill my tank? I want to die
9365 2018-06-29 17:53:51 Idk why people think their oil pantings where you fill up a cup and like spill it out is worth anything like anyone can learn that with a 10 minute YouTube video
9366 2018-06-29 17:53:46 The sit in your car oil change is a great concept, until it's 100 degrees outside and you realize you have to turn the car off.!
9367 2018-06-29 17:53:36 my dog and I will gladly trade the swamp for the South.
9368 2018-06-29 17:53:33 I need to go get a oil change.
9369 2018-06-29 17:53:29 Lmao sis I just realized there's also coconut oil in that tweet alaaaaaaaa 
9370 2018-06-29 17:53:23 this dollar rise and my oil diffuser are the only good things i got goin for me right now and honestly that’s fine

9374 2018-06-29 17:52:29 Our meal plan says to drink bulletproof coffee (coffee with cream, butter, and coconut oil) but I ain't about that life so I just use cream and these have the coconut oil in them instead, so... I start my day eating candy AND IT'S FOR A DIET this is awesome
9375 2018-06-29 17:52:12 And why would @TYTPolitics and @cenkuygur do that? If you haven't been with me long, let me refresh your memory. Ahem. IT'S OWNED BY OIL. HE'S PAID $10 MILL A YEAR. The Middle East owns him. #ProAmerican they are NOT. We are learning... we are learning...
9376 2018-06-29 17:52:09 You look like someone who needs a sign that says don't leave your children unattended.

9378 2018-06-29 17:52:01 One of my favourite gaming memories playing the oil tanker MGS2 level on the Demo with Z.O.E Japanese. Then finding out you could do all sorts with the guards.
9379 2018-06-29 17:51:56 Checked my car in to get my oil changed and the girl said “I know the account says it’s under Rian, but you don’t look like a Rian, so what name do you want me to call out when it’s done?” 

 thank you Sally once again for giving me a boys name it’s fine
9380 2018-06-29 17:51:52 I'd be worried about sanctions on Iran's oil too if it were my source of income.
9381 2018-06-29 17:51:48 Yes! Try out simple stuff first. I’ve had a lot of success with CeraVe. For oily skin, believe it or not a good moisturizer will help tons because it’ll keep your skin moist so it doesn’t feel like it has to produce extra oil. And sunscreen, always sunscreen!
9382 2018-06-29 17:51:47 Those oil and gas companies there could put him on another level of wealth...
9383 2018-06-29 17:51:43 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade. Also always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down (gravity with pull the product's moisture back up to the top surface)
9384 2018-06-29 17:51:38 Dumping of chicken in the news lately, but other profucts go under the radar because no local lobby group to raise awareness. For eg. I was listening to a local olive farmer explaining it’s impossible to produce olive oil cheaper than imported from Italy due to EU subsidization.
9385 2018-06-29 17:51:23 Curbs on H1B visas, sanctions under CAATSA for weapons procurement, case in WTO against minimum support prices in agriculture, tariffs against Indian commodities and restrictions on oil from Iran. What will we get at 'the next level of India-US ties'?

9392 2018-06-29 17:50:12 What is the size of the Quebec Supply Management protected dairy products economy vs the AB and SK oil and gas sector?
And yet, nobody in Ottawa seems to be concerned about that part of the economy, but all party seem to want to protect that Quebec monopoly.

9413 2018-06-29 17:48:21 And drink olive oil. At least a shot or two (ironically)
9414 2018-06-29 17:48:14 Last night I had a dream that I tried to make avocado toast but I forgot the olive oil and had no cheese.
9415 2018-06-29 17:48:14 Nice, I would like to rub oil all over those x

9418 2018-06-29 17:47:54 Briefly after getting yuan added to IMF currency basket in Oct 2016 CHI next wanted to fight "$ hegemony" w a petroyuan -- yuan denominated oil trade. But Trump blocked that hard w his pivot to KSA. Also bailing on TPP undercut CHI plan to use AIIB to give yuan loans to 3d World.
9419 2018-06-29 17:47:49 gotta get an oil change BUT this time it’s with gabbys dad.... pa que no se aprovechen los estupidos
9420 2018-06-29 17:47:41 Oh yeah that's why 6 other countries also agreed & Iran complied, now bc of trump 
The lifting of sanctions had roughly the opposite effect. It spurred around 7% growth over the past 2yrs, returned oil exports to nearly presanctions levels & unfroze the countries foreign assets
9421 2018-06-29 17:47:41 @FredMatiangi @JBoinnet. .please deal with this warlord inciting his people. Crude Oil is a resource for all Kenyans. Cattle rustling is an issue that is unrelated. He might stoke violence against the truck drivers!

9471 2018-06-29 17:39:08 Four supertankers chartered by energy major BP have been held up or delayed off China's east coast over the last two months, unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country's private refiners starts to impact global markets.
9472 2018-06-29 17:39:07 European refiners are cutting purchases of Iranian oil faster than expected as the U.S. prepares to reimpose sanctions on Iran, threatening a more severe impact than the last round of punitive measures in 2012 even though the EU has not joined in.

Not lots of dead birds if properly located; site studies will ensure these are. Temporary subsidies that scale down to zero soon, unlike oil which has huge subsidies for 100 years
9491 2018-06-29 17:37:13 And the Orlando update.  Drove it up yesterday, car performed flawlessly.  I had planned on changing the oil while here since I have access to a garage here... until I found a coupon for a full synthetic oil change at the Honda dealer for less than the retail cost of supplies.

9546 2018-06-29 17:32:15 agreed. Several of my municipal and county stakeholders in my research on the #EagleFord in 2015 noted that $70-80 was ideal—enough to generate a profit for the oil companies but not enough to overly burden the average American driver

9950 2018-06-29 16:53:05 @howlinrays just wondering, is the peanut oil you use to fry your chicken highly refined? i'm just being careful as i don't want to get an allergic reaction
9951 2018-06-29 16:52:49 Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the ten largest globally. But they arent helping? Where's your disgust there? Why arenr you highlighting libyas appauling behaviour?
9952 2018-06-29 16:52:38 Gotta play Total Praise today and tomorrow....but that song has the oil!!!!!!
9953 2018-06-29 16:52:36 Sir please predict again about International Oil Prices. They did decline according to your prediction but today they have again gone up with Brent crossing 79$ /barrel.
9954 2018-06-29 16:52:32 Truth, I burned myself with olive oil just last night, my arm looks leperous. There is even more danger with an open flame. Leaving the grilling to my hubs.

9960 2018-06-29 16:51:00 Millennials have already killed: cable, marriage, Buffalo Wild Wings, the oil industry, etc. We have much blood on our hands, what's a little more if it means we add ICE's pelt to the collection.
9961 2018-06-29 16:50:25 With current petroleum usage there is an estimated 45-50 years remaining in oil production. The expansion of GA 400 is not a wise investment given this prediction. 

An employee/employer address database could point out excessive travel. Families would be wise to reduce travel.
9962 2018-06-29 16:50:22 No, That’s not the flavor. It’s pretty distinctly bitter, like the bitterness and olive oil but amplified.
9963 2018-06-29 16:50:18 @WhiteHouse these OIL prices are going to throw a wet blanket on the great economy. A little help please....
9964 2018-06-29 16:50:09 Possible explanations for Canadian oil stocks' lagging.
1) End of quarter rebalancing means buying won't accelerate until July
2) Investors don't *really* believe in $73 oil
3) Investors believe the WCS dif will accelerate

9974 2018-06-29 16:49:32 What is "necessary red tape"?
Why not throw out Health and safety regulations for Oil and Gas industry workers?!
I am sure companies don't appreciate all that red tape that they have to deal with, plus think of the profits to be made!

Today's Fun Fact: Did you know that the Leduc #1 Well produced approximately 318,000 barrels of oil! 
9992 2018-06-29 16:47:28 Yes  I use Kératase Elixir in my hair. It’s an oil. A couple of pumps in my hands then I message it into my hair, it really helps me 
9993 2018-06-29 16:47:07 The #crypto industry always reminds me of early Alta oil and gas.  In 1914 gas was found.  Speculators and scammers went crazy.  So crazy the local Stock Exchange had trouble.  It took 30 years for oil to become really established with Imperial striking in Leduc. $BTC #Calgary
9994 2018-06-29 16:46:59 A demented chimpanzee would have run profits during the oil boom. Klein was a barely educated fool with a drinking problem
9995 2018-06-29 16:46:58 2016 was life or death for Putin; if Hillary won, she would have applied sanctions which would've tanked Vlad's economy and him. All Putin had to do was promise the win for traitor trump & give him a % of an oil Co. & Putin could rule the world. Trump sold out the US for money.
9996 2018-06-29 16:46:38 Again, totally untruthful propaganda you are pushing. Trump's gov will go down as one of the most corrupt in history & it's no coincidence the PC party is very cozy with them.
Oil ind which Harper could have improved in his long 10 year tenure is currently Trudeau's to clean up.
9997 2018-06-29 16:46:37 When the guy doing my oil change says “damn that’s your jeep?? It looks tough, I’m impressed”  & my day is made because there is no better compliment
9998 2018-06-29 16:46:23 I agree with your recent threads Unseen, I see unprecedented potential for growth.  We have our own oil now.  We've had a boot on our necks for more than 30 years.  The economy will explode into prosperity. For everyone.  Here you can be a millionaire in 5 years with a taco stand
9999 2018-06-29 16:46:19 Did you know about the deadly fire in Nigeria that happened yesterday? An oil tanker overturned and exploded. Listen, the whole world is in chaos. Hug your loved ones and tell them you love them every moment you have! Tomorrow is not promised! #LoveandLight

10006 2018-06-29 16:45:46 Hey #energy/#oil Twitter, here's a superrrr basic Q: is it still a "downturn" even? With XTO/Chevron/Pioneer turning a profit at <$26/barrel, is $70+/barrel WTI a "low price environment" still? What's the consensus here?
10007 2018-06-29 16:45:45 Well, then I’ll start doing the research and showing y’all proof that the problems you think vaccines caused are actually from Big Oil companies, and what they put into the water, air, and soil all over this country alone.
10008 2018-06-29 16:45:42 Did the civil war happen? How about the Great Depression ? OPEC oil embargo? What about the Boston tea party??
10009 2018-06-29 16:45:33 And Norway (easily the wealthiest) is incredibly oil rich.
10010 2018-06-29 16:45:24 Boom.....Boom! Kenya can't siphon oil while stealing livestock too from Turkana. Kama mbaya.  Turkana must enjoy the gains of independence
10011 2018-06-29 16:45:22 I got you! Remember I was telling you about that hallucinogenic cactus oil got? She puts it in that
10012 2018-06-29 16:45:16 The toy slime that kids love to play with... the stains they leave are oil stains. Treat accordingly on any surface.
10013 2018-06-29 16:45:16 I did. And Trump has a great need for Putin's help to offset the loss of oil in the world market that the sanctions against Iran cause, Trump needs Russia to ramp up the production so India toes the line. So Putin has bargain chips on the table.
10014 2018-06-29 16:45:02 I ain’t think I would be paying this much for a oil change but it’s whatever as long as it getting done

10022 2018-06-29 16:44:00 These seem like unhealthy binaries. Need jobs in Greater Minnesota? Build a detention center or prison. Need jobs in Greater Minnesota? Build an oil pipeline. I am sure a little creativity could allow us to answer that question with better, less harmful, more sustainable ideas.
