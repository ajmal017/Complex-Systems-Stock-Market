1 2019-01-04 23:59:13 Coached my people on stocks today. They were encouraged to invest in stocks even with little amount of capital ,like $1000 . Over 150 people got this stuff. Being paused but going to continue tomorrow, Isha Allah . No better feeling than being ur own boss.....
2 2019-01-04 23:58:34 And how did you convert to this hardcore stream of libertarianism? Semi-related: do you consider yourself a sovereign citizen? If not, what do you think of the sovereign citizen movement?
3 2019-01-04 23:58:03 Those CEOs should've been jailed and stocks sold and given to employees
4 2019-01-04 23:58:00 Gun owner, but not an NRA member:  

Bump stocks are a really niche item which are worthless to most shooters. There was almost no upside for the NRA to fight Trump on this issue. 

Of course, had Obama done this, it would have been the literal destruction of the 2nd Amendment.
5 2019-01-04 23:57:44 This is exactly how I feel about diet non-caffeinated drinks. No one stocks diet ginger ale, or diet Sprite.
6 2019-01-04 23:57:33 What did you do for the government?
7 2019-01-04 23:57:03 2% annual tax on US stocks and bonds would generate ~$1.4T.  Collect directly from brokerage, exchange or perhaps equity/bond issuer, so impossible to evade, regardless of who/where the owner is.
8 2019-01-04 23:56:48 It's not my forte, but I think like stocks, the trend is your friend...but I think it's your enemy for a long time if macro valuations are anything to go by.
9 2019-01-04 23:56:37 Even with QE though, don't the banks need to sell their T-bonds / MBS and be willing to buy stocks with the proceeds? Not sure that would put prices to the moon especially if earnings / fundies deteriorating. Would weaken USD & help EM I suppose.
10 2019-01-04 23:56:34 S&p futures has correlation ratio above 0.3 with most world stocks, which will go up next Monday sharply.
11 2019-01-04 23:56:00 Ovomit, the fact you hated him so much for no reason still boggles. Who banned bump stocks? Trump. Who is hurting farmers and workers? Trump. But Obama existed and was in the White House and you guys lost your shit. Says more about you than me
12 2019-01-04 23:55:16 It's a stunning palette. I think BeautyBay in the UK still has stocks and I think they ship to the US. It's worth it. Alien is an amazing pallet for cool toned & Thirsty is so so summery. Ugh Jeffree's products are amazing! I cannot wait for the foundations this year!
13 2019-01-04 23:53:48 Kevin can you please explain that they aren't brokers and he isn't trading anything anyway those aren't stocks or equities, they have been paper trading under the guise of a stock market. Go to your local Attorney General for faster results. @Guruleaks1
14 2019-01-04 23:53:17 Bro you gotta teach me how to trade...I wanna get into stocks and stuuf

40 2019-01-04 23:50:35 Keep in mind I'm viewing it from the lens of a Wario main, who is a heavy char. I just don't see inkling consistently being able to close stocks before at least 160 vs Wario
41 2019-01-04 23:49:33 Not sure kasi limited stocks lang po kay supplier 
42 2019-01-04 23:49:26 Lol even stocks. But intraday I can’t do it. Too much they can lean on. But it’s probably the same...it was just harder for me
43 2019-01-04 23:48:22 So... again, are you actually “well-off” and “comfortable” (which is generally how wealthy folks describe themselves here), or are you just a wannabe?

Because your values, theories, and manner of speech *do not fit in* with either new-money families or old ones.
44 2019-01-04 23:47:42 Isn't that what dx will offer? Tokenized stocks 24/7 trading.
45 2019-01-04 23:47:31 Premium burn? How’d you exit an option position after hours?
46 2019-01-04 23:47:26 Fucking bump stocks
47 2019-01-04 23:47:24 I find DIAs are best bare bones product to make sure there's some $ down the road. If time horizon is long, I'd rather educate on benefits/upside of stocks instead. I've yet to see a variable annuity I'd recommend (only possibility is someone with no kids/heirs/beneficiaries).
48 2019-01-04 23:46:47 Im not saying that the stocks are out of a bear market or a correction, im saying everything good is happening at once and I feel the economic strength and the increased chance of an agreement with china will calm down the markets and push it back into a bear market eventually
49 2019-01-04 23:45:26 Did I say we are out of a correction at all, Im saying the stock market is rebounding and it was today panic selling. People were saying the economy will start to dip and the stocks will go down even further with it. The S&P climbed 3.5 percent today. Slashing substantial losses.
50 2019-01-04 23:45:22 With the level of inflation he foresees, hard assets will rise spectacularly in value, both in terms of price and demand.

He also foresees foreign stocks increasing in value as foreign nations will easily be able to pay off their debts in devalued US dollars.
51 2019-01-04 23:44:48 I think the stocks went up today because the Dems took over yesterday not because of you.
52 2019-01-04 23:44:37 A little sarcasm in my response to someone complaining about the stocks dropping and Trump
53 2019-01-04 23:44:21 Great Fairy morning! New authorized Dealer added to my lumalaking pamilya. Stocks na lang talaga kulang. Fairy Skin lipad ka na!  Ikaw sali ka na rin! Be my authorized dealer!

54 2019-01-04 23:44:18 Chinese stocks and funds I track bounced strong off a double bottom, with a higher low and greater than average volume.  In my view the worst in that market has past.
55 2019-01-04 23:44:18 Trickle down economics has failed, wages are falling, people are having to work more jobs to pay the bills all the while the super elite rich keep sitting on stockpiles of cash. I guess you like sending the middle class into poverty and ruining the economy? Stocks are plummeting
56 2019-01-04 23:43:44 took 4 stocks dab
57 2019-01-04 23:43:32 But I will always want to live by the life I once promised myself to and that was too not ever worry about a price tag because I know I am that financially stable from being smart. Investing into stocks. 401k. Savings. Not worrying about needing the fancy stuff
58 2019-01-04 23:43:01 #BigBounce on voit toujours les mêmes candidats "bêtes à concours" des émissions télévisées, il faudrait penser à renouveler vos stocks sans parler de cette émission achetée à l'étranger qui est nulle juste après quasiment de ninja warrior 
59 2019-01-04 23:42:07 Yet you don’t understand how private business works? I find it hard to believe you trade stocks or you would understand what a 70% tax would do to private business stocks.
60 2019-01-04 23:42:04 point to where i argued against anything other than your lie about stocks. oh that's right, you can't.

you have to switch and try to pivot the discussion. so predictable lefty 
61 2019-01-04 23:41:08 CFP a response to international fishing waters being a commons good ie zero excludability with high rivalry for fish. Has helped preserve NS stocks. Biggest prob for UK fishers is UK Gov - not EU- allowing a small number of large UK firms massive share of the quota.
62 2019-01-04 23:40:51 No stocks dipped so low because of the election and how the Dems took over the house. The stock market rose over a 1000 points last week. And when the Dems waste the next 2 years trying to impeach Trump instead of helping Americans, Trump 2020
63 2019-01-04 23:39:01 Lo de la caida de la industria y construcción es esperable con esta tasa de interés ya que no se reponen stocks
Lamentablemente fue la única forma de parar la corrida cambiaria
Todo va a mejorar cuando bajen las tasas en pesos
64 2019-01-04 23:38:43 Stocks and saving up a cash fund for real estate so doubting, but I voted for stocks.
65 2019-01-04 23:38:43 I don’t mind it at all personally (slight bias cuz i had to deal with this in smash 4 lmao). But Peach makes you work extra hard for those stocks
66 2019-01-04 23:38:17 Are you actually wealthy or just aspirationally wealthy?

I ask because *none* of the wealthy people I know talk or think like this. And I’ve been fortunate enough that I know more than my fair share.
67 2019-01-04 23:38:04 Thanks!! I’ve been looking for some more female traders. If you have any interest in trading pot stocks, check out my article!
68 2019-01-04 23:37:50 If I was smarter I would have put everything in liquor stocks on 11/9/2016.
69 2019-01-04 23:36:20 Because Obama was there 8 years, and his record is what it is, while Trump is yet to be seen, and stocks are far more volatile and worse long term indicators
70 2019-01-04 23:36:16 someone who knows stocks tell me how to short another man's fursona
71 2019-01-04 23:35:46 Knowing where to start, what type of place is reputable.... No one in my family had ever bought stocks, other than in their 401k. I have no clue where to start, what's safe, legalities, etc. It's overwhelming - so I just don't!
72 2019-01-04 23:35:22 The more you use the character (i'd recommend watching @gsmVoiD youtube) you start to release this cute pokemon is a true monster. I'm at the point where i'm comfortable gimping bad recovery characters off stage for easy stocks.
73 2019-01-04 23:34:38 “Jerome Powell is an idiot.”              Stocks -2,500 
“Jerome Powell isn’t an idiot”.          Stocks +750


74 2019-01-04 23:33:38 No calls, only puts. No problem with tanking even though my stocks will be sad. Haha
75 2019-01-04 23:32:54 Thinking about that night I wasted so much money in Vegas and drunkenly I pulled all my money out of stocks. I wonder if I’d be rich now 
76 2019-01-04 23:32:46 @realDonaldTrump POTUS a big thanks for eliminating that national deficit with that stock market you made go higher...oh...wait the National Debt is up under you and stocks are down.   #AnotherTrumpBankruptcyComing
77 2019-01-04 23:32:10 Je suis addict...et j'en trouve toujours dans le supermarché près de chez moi...ya jamais eu de rupture de stocks en général les gens aiment pas
78 2019-01-04 23:31:55 If I had put all my money into stocks a year ago, I wouldn't need to work right now  and I'm mad.
79 2019-01-04 23:31:40 Yup, I live on edge. Haha
But $SQ and $TWTR were best 2 stocks for me in 2018, realized 100%+ gain on both with stocks unlike $NVDA. Oh boy. LoL
80 2019-01-04 23:30:32 It will certainly help with your uranium stocks! 
81 2019-01-04 23:30:01 Stocks roared back Friday after investors received three belated New Year's presents.
82 2019-01-04 23:28:10 Chip, as to the wild DOW swings-- the DOW is only 30 stocks; granted, they are the major players in business, but that's out of 5000+ different companies in the total stock market. Too much emphasis put on these 30, IMHO 
83 2019-01-04 23:27:01 @jimcramer why are cybrr stocks not rallying?
84 2019-01-04 23:26:42 I began following him probably mid 2000s. 

He’s a hard asset guy, gold/silver, mining stocks and the like mostly.

He’s also very critical of the Fed and attributes much of what happens in the stock market to their monetary interventions.
85 2019-01-04 23:26:01 Investing in crypto last year was a great choice i did because the stocks are going up. (Invest in your money y’all)
86 2019-01-04 23:25:35 These are the 1 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$BSBR
87 2019-01-04 23:25:11 I think you read charts differently than I do. Other than the crash that started while Bush was in office, the last decade has had generally increasing stocks. Some ups and downs, as is always true, but some record breaking gains in some quarters.
88 2019-01-04 23:25:08 Non rien à voir. L'appli est différente du site web ;) 
Comme les stocks magasins qui sont aussi différents. 
C'est juste que l'offre venait d'être mise en ligne et il y a souvent ce délais aussi parfois. Là les stocks tiennent toujours ;)
89 2019-01-04 23:24:57 I see tech stocks bleeding hard, if crypto holds January I will buy more bags regardless the price
90 2019-01-04 23:24:33 The FED raising rates was causing people to move from stocks to treasuries/gold/silver. You must have failed Economics class. The FED eased concerns today and went up 700+ pts and 321k jobs added. You lose Socialist.
91 2019-01-04 23:23:37 It will slow down the economy because people don't have $ to pay their bills, daycares have no kids, Workers will protest, investors will pull out stocks, businesses will fail, no one will use public transit. Citizens need to stop buying retail and only buy food and pay rent.
92 2019-01-04 23:23:26 Cramer:  "And to everyone else, here's my hope.  You can finally buy stocks again without fighting the Fed."   Then Cramer whispered:  "wow!"
93 2019-01-04 23:23:12 she is one of the biggest hub thieves,hdogtx too,and has that  trash about treat others as youd want to be treated....satan! hipoctyte!
94 2019-01-04 23:22:57 Se essa foto fosse o que expressa, Israel não estaria na posse e falando para as corporações: Brazil Stocks? Buy
95 2019-01-04 23:21:05 Coca Cola finally started giving me dividends for my bought stocks 
96 2019-01-04 23:20:05 I give it weight for sure, but in the end it is always about the individual stocks on my list.  FTD sharpens my focus and gives me permission to buy for sure, but the actual stocks will pull my money in after that.
97 2019-01-04 23:18:43 Would you rather have Tristan T. or Bagley in a 12 team ros? Looking stocks and rebound. Thanks
98 2019-01-04 23:18:38 Yep, cause people suffering and property loss and let board of directors cash in their stocks,  take huge yearly bonuses ,change board of directors,  file bankruptcy to pay vendors 10 cents to the dollar... sell out and rename and nothings changed.
99 2019-01-04 23:17:47 $SDT and $SDR say they do not plan a reverse split of the units or other action in an effort to affect the trading price. #stocks #dividends #StockMarket
100 2019-01-04 23:16:28 Fell the most percentage, not the lowest. And thats just stocks. The economy is still doing very good
101 2019-01-04 23:16:04 I agree.  Some are saying in first quarter we could go to Dow 20k before we bottom and start@new uptrend.  I sold some stocks today at close.  I think we should hit 2600 where it should find bigger resistance.  But who knows
102 2019-01-04 23:15:10 New EG series for 2019! #EGAnswers: You ask, we answer. What stocks are vexing you? What's our opinion on your favourites? What do you want to ask a CEO but have been too scared? Call and leave us a message on +1 (415) DOPE-PIT .
103 2019-01-04 23:14:46 SELL “”CASH COVERED PUTS”” leverage on your own with stocks you would like to own!!!
104 2019-01-04 23:14:38 The market did go into correction territory but its gained 1,700 in the last 10 todays. Also the trade war partly factors into both the stocks and the industry, and china and the US is setting up a big meeting to make a deal soon. So everything you said really is misleading.
105 2019-01-04 23:13:53 It’s awesome though how wrestling seems to annihilate time zones & smb’s leisurely watching SD on the couch early work day night while I stay up till 5am for it, or how I can watch brunch time NJPW and smb stocks up on cold brew to watch it in the middle of the night. It’s dope.
106 2019-01-04 23:13:53 Yes me too.  He never mentions on tv about his Dow theory sell last week and how he sold stocks
107 2019-01-04 23:13:50 Trump is the best!!!! My family is dripping in cash since president trump took office. My stocks have gone up 10x, I can retire in 5 years instead of 50!!!
108 2019-01-04 23:12:49 Newswire: double top in internet security stocks leading to sizable downside for retail traders, insider trading to blame suggests indignant Mnuger.
109 2019-01-04 23:12:27 Yo hablo en términos fiscales y comparando el desastre de Cristina que gobernó consumiendo los stocks de capital acumulado (energía, ganado, fertilidad del suelo, infraestructura, industria con tremendo atraso tecnológico) y un gasto público 12 puntos del PBI arriba contra 2007
110 2019-01-04 23:11:30 DO you really think it will stay up almost a million people are not getting paid which = money not being invested. Also to survive people will be selling stocks to just survive.  If this shut down last as he said months or years we are fucked.
111 2019-01-04 23:11:01 Honestly I really like that there’s variety in the stages for once and it’s not the same like 3 stages and the actual rules r basically the same as smash 4 except for the stocks and time so I don’t see the problem in it
112 2019-01-04 23:09:12 Why???? It’s just getting started!
113 2019-01-04 23:09:10 Through my opening 3 rounds and only two stocks yet dropped between them all combined. Great start
114 2019-01-04 23:07:43 Stocks to buy in 2019: Lululemon and Apple (because they are going down! Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it!)
115 2019-01-04 23:07:04 I hope one day if the Egyptian League will become a really professional league and clubs will be companies with stocks.....you will take over the club to show them how business is done.....the club chairman should be a man with wisdom and business mentality not a football player
116 2019-01-04 23:05:35 Lagging indicator......

Isn't bad, China economic data bad yesterday ...result 650 pt drop in the dow

the Fed made the statement today it drove stocks higher because they know Trump's has screwed up with the tarrifs

The only thing holding up the stock market is the Fed
117 2019-01-04 23:05:21 Problem is the Deep State & Silicon Valley can easily tank the economy for a few years, just enough to hurt Trump 2020.

Is it a coincidence that tech stocks all going down?

119 2019-01-04 23:05:08 And then guess what. I'm going to spend the last two weeks of March triumphantly driving around Europe, bent banana in one hand and red passport in the other, welcoming migrants and protecting fish stocks
120 2019-01-04 23:03:36 The press: if stocks plunge, that is bad. If stocks surge, that’s also bad.
121 2019-01-04 23:02:41 I totally agree. Investor who held FANG stocks made a killing for years, and if they are still holding — now they are getting killed.
122 2019-01-04 23:02:13 Yes and no hence why legislating bump stocks has proved tricky

126 2019-01-04 23:00:38 More and more stocks are drumming up huge interest on the NYSE. Do you think this means that cannabis will be legalized nationwide in America eventually?

And do you think more countries are going to make moves toward legalization?
127 2019-01-04 23:00:21 Les stocks aloué a chaque magasin (si les magasins en reçoivent des non reservé) c'est deja "prévu". Dans le sens ou le siege a deja fait sa distribution par rapport a ses commandes. Mais on ne sait pas combien on va en avoir.

128 2019-01-04 23:00:21 Great idea. But when all the former super rich people stop buying planes, boats, luxury cars and jewelry what do we do then? Oh i forgot investments that they make in companies and stocks.
129 2019-01-04 23:00:15 BANG! flag bump stocks
130 2019-01-04 22:59:23 Worst December for US stocks since the Great Depression. He inherited GOLD and turned it into . So sit down
131 2019-01-04 22:59:20 F$ck the speech,  look at stocks going up
132 2019-01-04 22:58:26 Apple’s stocks are down, I guess it’s time for them to introduce another connector type and cable.
133 2019-01-04 22:58:12 I'm not sure if you've heard, but there's super low unemployment, there's actual GROWTH IN WAGES, and stocks actually help anyone with a 401k, or any other savings plan (most middle class people), just to name a few. And it's supply side economics.
134 2019-01-04 22:56:53 Going to review my portfolio this weekend. I want to return to being neutral as well as revisit the stocks on my buy list.

Not sure I trust this move up. Saw something similar Dec 4th. Either way, want to have a plan ready. 
135 2019-01-04 22:55:44 Let's put that to the test. I have vaaaaast stocks of nothing. 
136 2019-01-04 22:55:15 If you give them your bump stocks then they will have all of the bump stocks. This is the exact same thing that happened in Nazi Germany when Hitler made everyone turn in their guns. And we know #LasVegasShooting was a False Flag incident too.
137 2019-01-04 22:53:35 The market has to pull my money back in by proving itself thru the action of leading growth stocks.  It’s just that simple for me.  1 small stock broke out today on Monster relative volume as I define it.  First one I’ve seen in a couple months. It’s a small start.
138 2019-01-04 22:53:34 Sorry, my views on individual stocks are reserved for my columns and my newsletters. Here I just post 'em and you can decide.
139 2019-01-04 22:52:07 Brawl had 3 and would have shortened to 2 the year Smash 4 was released.

Melee and PM have 4.

Only 64 has 5.

Stocks are always important in general by definition...
140 2019-01-04 22:51:54 STOCKS IN FERRY TICKETS AND REMOVAL COMPANIES
141 2019-01-04 22:51:19 Lee, does your numbers reflect the fact that a large number of stocks are owned by pension funds, school districts, etc who are not individual people?
If not then is your 84% number low?
142 2019-01-04 22:50:35 In fact if you are IT you probably can provide good info on time between a wave that stock is running low from a shop to deliver to replace .

You might also be able to find some way of picturing what a day’s delay means in warehouse stocks...the amount that has to be stored.
143 2019-01-04 22:50:35 Such a scam.....another attack on our president by the heathens that run the Fed Reserve.  One word from them and stocks soar.  Time to close down the Fed.

146 2019-01-04 22:47:21 Or how about he’s pro 2nd amendment but made bump stocks illegal when Obama made them legal?!? The markets do well and he claims ownership but when they crash it’s the dems?!? Or trying to discredit GEN Mattis cos they don’t agree... cmon
147 2019-01-04 22:47:03 I’ll try to do that more. Thx.  I did actually buy 2 stocks today for the first time in a long while and still own them..... baby steps...
148 2019-01-04 22:45:52 Pretty sure those arguing for higher rates aren't in favor of loopholes.

I'm a beneficiary of many of the current tax policies--cap on SS, income via stocks, NQDCP.  I don't pay taxes at all on about 1/3 of my annual income

That's nuts
149 2019-01-04 22:45:21 not really. they've been open in the past about not caring about bump stocks. 

their conduct following the castile shooting was much more disturbing.
150 2019-01-04 22:45:18 They want to raise taxes and impeach the president but can’t understand why overseas investors are dumping stocks. Idiots
151 2019-01-04 22:45:00 WINNING!Every time POTUS makes a big move, stocks soar!
152 2019-01-04 22:44:59 In 2018, my investment portfolio went up to an incredible number. I was up hundreds of percent.  #Apple $SPY #stocks $AAPL #investing
153 2019-01-04 22:44:23 SPIKER COMBINE stocks slump
154 2019-01-04 22:43:49 J'ai cru voir qu'une offre de reprise est prévue, ce qui signifie que les magasins auront (normalement) du stock pour faire ces reprises...
Mais pour les stocks, le site web faut le voir comme un magasin a part.
Parfois ils ont des offres que chez eux et ils ont leur stock
155 2019-01-04 22:43:41 @cowrywise can i purchase stocks and do a DRIP on it on your app?
156 2019-01-04 22:43:18 I have stocks that have lost $10,000 in the last few months. It is my fucking business

159 2019-01-04 22:41:33 Can we bring back the stocks? Please? It will provide some use for all the food that will have rotted, stuck in transit . Lots of candidate targets- JRM,DD,BJ,NF,AB,etc etc. Feel free to add more.
160 2019-01-04 22:41:27 QE won't help real economy. It is stocks' favorite form of liquidity and helps them plenty. Just distinguishing between the two.

163 2019-01-04 22:39:28 If stocks keep rallying, the corollary would be the worst bond crash in history. Ergo stocks will not keep rallying. Bonds will do so hot either, despite that.
164 2019-01-04 22:37:59 Come on Big Pumper apparently is a lot of people’s hero on here, should see the comments I got for asking big pumper to prove even buys or sells stocks, my guess is a paid pumper
165 2019-01-04 22:37:48 Wall Street stocks surged higher on Friday to finish a volatile week on an upbeat note following dovish Federal Reserve comments and a strong US jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.3 percent, or nearly 750 points, to end the week at 23,433.16.

168 2019-01-04 22:36:55 Ok,, confirmed from the transfer agent NO share structure change for WDBG..
169 2019-01-04 22:36:32 One of the stocks that has blown everybody’s nuts off is $NVDA. It’s surprising all the @cnbc guys like @ReformedBroker are not touting this now rather than back when it was at all time highs. It’s actually at a price where it might be interesting now.

171 2019-01-04 22:35:07 My track record with predicting the stocks has been pretty solid, so, we shall see...LOL
172 2019-01-04 22:35:03 @ScottTakeda thanks for the follow. I see you worked with @jayrmonty I once threw tomatoes at her while she was in stocks. It was kind of scary cause they wanted good throws and I was worried about hitting her too hard. Turned out great on screen. She's awesome. Very positive.
173 2019-01-04 22:34:46 Father in law got his root stocks from bare root super market trees!
174 2019-01-04 22:33:59 #Trump 2018 was the worst for stocks in 10 years,
175 2019-01-04 22:33:54 I thought this too, when I saw the media bashing Tesla and his stocks plummeting.  The media actually shows us who the good guys are.
176 2019-01-04 22:33:45 Good day for market and for these stocks: $AGEN, $TNXP, $CREG, $SOLO, $MBRX, $ARQL

183 2019-01-04 22:33:08 Or does anyone take financial advise from that money and stocks channel?
184 2019-01-04 22:32:31 OK but I think you may be overthinking the process or perhaps trying too hard to guess the next move here, maybe because of the extreme volatility that we've been getting in the market.  I'm not typically day trading stocks.
185 2019-01-04 22:31:47 The week in #crypto and #blockchain:
• 10th anniversary of the #Bitcoin genesis block
• @Bakkt raises $182 million
• @BitTorrent announces $BTT token
• Italy forms team to guide its #blockchain strategy
• @DxdotExchange announces trading of tokenized stocks
186 2019-01-04 22:30:38 Happy Friday! What a wild ride. Stocks surged today w/ a job report that smashed expectations combined w/ Powell's comments. Do yourself a favor, the media is too loud, too noisy & freaking everybody out. Turn it off & tune it out. Focus on taking care of yourself and your family
187 2019-01-04 22:30:33 Investors in Apple stocks.            The EBITDA of 2018, can surprise positively, net income will be the largest of the company.
188 2019-01-04 22:30:18 Pretty good #daytrades today. Short $WATT $NBEV long $UGAZ.  I’ll post charts later trying to finish flip watching stocks on my phone. Blows !!
189 2019-01-04 22:27:55 C'est vrai, vous êtes l'historique de leurs stocks !
190 2019-01-04 22:27:47 Need for hiring dictates more than cash on hand does. 

Corporations that feel they’re staffed tend to reinvest the money or service debt / stocks.
191 2019-01-04 22:27:45 I’m in both stocks and I made a lot of money on $WUC already as well as still holding significant shares in the money in $WSTRF.  I like both but fresh money at these prices I am putting my money in Goviex! $gxu $gvxxf  232 could make Western the better play depending on outcome!
192 2019-01-04 22:27:38 Thank you for the coverage of the MASS Street Stocks. Lots of blue collars racers, instead of the rent-a-rides.
193 2019-01-04 22:27:26 Stocks go up in the long term
194 2019-01-04 22:26:51 i said in a comment toward mick that this game is a lot more similar to smash 4 than melee/pm, this is a game with 3 stocks not 5 or w/e and you hold on to your stocks until the absolute bitter end of it in this game. stocks definitely hold more weight in the diff games.
195 2019-01-04 22:26:20 Actually you have stocks NOT bonds
196 2019-01-04 22:26:15 Lots of those witches already in Village Stocks, others planning to confess and clear their consciences! We pray many more will come forward, aware of duty to country and family, not to a Moron!
197 2019-01-04 22:24:54 BUT STILL... TWO STOCKS??
198 2019-01-04 22:24:20 Why ok I got 31.19.  I'll take 10 stocks
199 2019-01-04 22:24:17 Yup, it’s just the stocks that I own and rest all are flying high haha
200 2019-01-04 22:23:44 You better check your stocks, Fiter.  You're coasting on old information.
201 2019-01-04 22:23:37 Since Donald Trump was elected I have:
⚬A better job
⚬A better income
⚬401K with greater value
⚬Stocks with more value
⚬Greater interest on my savings
⚬Hope for the future.

But...
I'm not tired of #winning yet!
 @realDonaldTrump
202 2019-01-04 22:23:28 I can buy USTs or I can buy stocks or a house or a car, but I can’t buy more than one.

If pvt sector has to finance US deficits, consumption that drives US GDP will get crowded out
203 2019-01-04 22:23:11 What app do you use for stocks?
204 2019-01-04 22:23:09 Always on Neva off my connect we’ll stocks me
205 2019-01-04 22:23:06 What exactly makes you think anything will happen? First "D5" failed miserably, then they said "by the end of the year", nada! Bum stocks illegal? They let the Demonkratz take over the House...how is one suppose to "trust the plan" when we don't even know what the plan is?! 
206 2019-01-04 22:22:40 All I can say...there was a reason I said I was pulling all my money out of stocks and putting into crypto...#Crypto #ETC #BitCoin #DogeCoin #LiteCoin
207 2019-01-04 22:22:07 Just fought a ridlet wit items on, 2 stocks, and 3 mins even though my preferences say none of thsose
208 2019-01-04 22:21:57 For the first time in my investment career I’ve earned enough dividends to buy more stocks with. In my mind that pretty much makes me the best Warren Buffet  if you don’t feel the same way then you’re a hater and this is not the way you want to start your 2019 off
209 2019-01-04 22:21:41 Euh, si c'est des matchs en 2 stocks, et que t'as 2 stocks d'avance, oui tu as gagné, mais pas au time out 
210 2019-01-04 22:21:27 I  Buffett too, but I noticed several months ago he bought Apple as price (and S&P 500) seemed to be correcting at the top. Buffett is known for staying away from tech stocks bc he doesn’t understand tech. He based his Apple buy on the iPhone  being around for the next 10 yrs
211 2019-01-04 22:20:48 Well Taleb says not to give him advice about stocks, but to show him what’s in your portfolio.  As in, what you do with your own money is what you really think.

I’m analogously unimpressed by someone who “advocates” stoicism and then takes a lavish vacation to Maui.
212 2019-01-04 22:20:46 No real news yet stocks jumped. Daily 5 to 600 points swings in dow jones is the norm these days
213 2019-01-04 22:20:35 You do know that come the revolution you will be
a) sacked
b) put in the stocks in Trafalgar Square
c) you and your families made the subject of police harassment for the rest of your lives,
don't you?
214 2019-01-04 22:20:33 Justement je campe et je gagne parce que c'est victoire automatique si j'ai 2 stocks d'avance 
215 2019-01-04 22:20:28 Real estate investments and stocks in Nike,  apple, uber and air bnb
216 2019-01-04 22:20:14 I thiiink you lose two stocks if it's counted as an sd?
217 2019-01-04 22:19:01 I remember. You guys were doing liquidity debating too off that stuff?  Basically same strategy I did for a lot of stocks back then to box it and trade the spread of high volume super thick stocks.
218 2019-01-04 22:18:48 so you admitting that you are primarily a PM/Melee player swaying your opinion invalidates your arguments even more to me. Ult is a game way more similar to smash4 than the other two, these are games where you hold your stocks to the bitter end.
219 2019-01-04 22:18:33 Quelle excellente idée les matchs à 2 stocks et seulement TROIS MINUTES
Bien joué les mecs là on s'éclate
220 2019-01-04 22:18:23 I don't see $ up stocks up bond yields lower. That's a perfect outcome. Will not happen. They can't have a perfect outcome, yield curve is inverting everywhere. I could see a new synthetic high in stocks, but yields move much lower, the bond market is already pricing it in. $?
221 2019-01-04 22:17:48 Stocks are way down for the year
222 2019-01-04 22:17:48 Hey @jimcramer have you ever thought of co-hosting a PTI type show about stocks? Think it would be a huge hit. Hmm who would co-host with you?
223 2019-01-04 22:17:15 Gold stocks are too hot to jump on now.  Wait for a pullback perhaps? $NST is the gold standard for ASX gold companies, still value in $DCN IMO but I'm now less enthusiastic about $SAR at these prices.  $WGX is a punt, a lot depends on their costs upcoming quarterly.
224 2019-01-04 22:17:00 71% of global stocks ended 2018 in a bear  market.* How did investors react? Matthew Bartolini examines the data.   
*Bloomberg Finance L.P., as of 12/31/2018.
225 2019-01-04 22:16:51 @Apple @AppleSupport How comeyou don’t send a return label with online orders? You make it next to impossibleto return an item from your website when there are no apple stores within 200 miles. No wonder your stocks are tanking.
226 2019-01-04 22:16:33 It only takes one impeachable offense. Not more than one. Trump has done none. But we have the lowest unemployment for ALL minorities. Great stocks. The prez is great n you listen to morons.
227 2019-01-04 22:16:30 OBAMCARE  created by law makers to BOOST the very stocks they were givein by the insurance corps as preks to write regulations in thier favor then at peak the larger holders cashed out and re bought at 70% lower only to lose thier asses after
228 2019-01-04 22:16:05 Definitely "bookmark worthy" thanks. Cannabis stocks will always be a tiny portion of what we do and all our other individual holdings are US-listed, so I'm hoping there's an equivalent compilation since I currently wade through EDGAR filings for comparable data.
229 2019-01-04 22:15:03 You don't even need an advantage. You can just trade stocks since it kills the opponent first.
230 2019-01-04 22:14:14 If you don't study any companies, you have the same success  buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at  your cards.
#PeterLynch
231 2019-01-04 22:13:27 my stocks are surging beyond control
232 2019-01-04 22:13:26 Pretty much same levels....$BTC bullish and still waiting for a burst thru Resistance (R) = $4400 with Support (S) of $3600 and a stop out of $3500...$ETH  R = $150ish and S of $115-120, stocks are choppy AF and $BTC has been hanging in. We been buying since 12/15.  Not advice
233 2019-01-04 22:12:59 I know but I can’t remember the last time Mattel’s stocks bumped up at least one point. I can understand 0.29 or 0.45, but the fact it bumped up a whole point is huge
234 2019-01-04 22:12:49 CEOs are bearish biology technology stocks.
235 2019-01-04 22:12:40 That's why all these corporations bought back stocks with their tax break to drive up their price instead of giving employees raises or building new factories, right?
236 2019-01-04 22:12:32 The jury is still out on if that is a big deal in ultimate. Because it's not a big deal in melee or PM. I think having 3 stocks as opposed to 4 matters with small blast zones. But when I personally play on WW. I do not feel like the stage is janking me out
237 2019-01-04 22:12:21 The arguments anti-Apple goons keep tossing around get really redundant. I keep seeing “bent iPad” rants all over the place, yet they don’t even have experience with one? Pretty much, they see it on YouTube videos and start squawking, lol... Same goes for Apple stocks.
238 2019-01-04 22:12:13 My favourite of all the deep rube stocks.
239 2019-01-04 22:11:12 So like?? Is Mii Brawler supposed to lose two stocks when they use side-b suicide off ledge??
240 2019-01-04 22:10:48 Okay, in terms of logic, let me restate that... Bump stocks are not necessary to the operation of a firearm.
241 2019-01-04 22:09:31 There is also plenty of affirmative action/socialism  given away to many many corporations in the form of Tax credits and breaks-but wait- they are the “job creators “ I can hear the right screaming- right- job creators who repatriated $1 trillion dollars to buyback their stocks.
242 2019-01-04 22:09:18 10 years ago I was up to my ears in debt and totally ignorant about monetary policy. Thanks to Bitcoin today I'm completely debt free, have a sizeable savings account, bitcoin and stocks portfolio and read Murray Rothbard and Ludwig Von Mises.
243 2019-01-04 22:09:08 tryna be more versed in stocks finances investments all that shit..
244 2019-01-04 22:08:32 Do you actually know what’s going on with the stock market?? Because if you don’t trade then stfu! Market may be down on an average but certain stocks are soaring. If you know what you are doing, which obviously you don’t, you’d be buying low & selling high. I made 6k today 
245 2019-01-04 22:08:13 Hello everyone, due to lack of stocks, @/mildxwild will not accept international orders :((
246 2019-01-04 22:08:04 in what way? Defeating Isis, great economy, loves his country, bringing troops home, securing our border, keeping his promises, giving power back to the states, lowering taxes, banning bump stocks,raising wages, lowering unemployment, while standing up for people that deserve it.
247 2019-01-04 22:07:50 Now, here’s where market gets really tricky if it actually has put in a short/intermediate term bottom. It won’t give u an entry point & it’ll make you feel like you are chasing for the next 100 SPX points. Selling puts on stocks you want can help.  If u get put, you’re happy.
248 2019-01-04 22:07:21 yeah real shit, even i shouldnt be in stocks rn im just taking a chance im super confident in

you should be maxing savings allowances and shit and then looking at funds unless youre f ull time stocky dude

this shit is so complicated
249 2019-01-04 22:07:03 The first Trump appointed head of the CDC bought tobacco stocks and had to resign; the second Trump appointed CDC chief was considered too ethically compromised for GWB to appoint to the job.
250 2019-01-04 22:06:48 So @Cnbc I wonder if we are going to here Dan N. say there are NO catalysts to make stocks rise again tonight?  LOL  $compq
251 2019-01-04 22:06:48 No decís burradas. Pero si sos comerciante sabes que cuando te financian las ventas te cobran la tasa. Si sube , te suben los precios Si pierden dinero pq están bajando stocks, cuando querés volver a comprar no hay. Y los precios suben. Sabes todo lo que hay q saber
252 2019-01-04 22:06:37 It would be nice if the Democrats will make bump stocks legal again since Trump made them illegal.. They don't like it when he succeeds at anything..

254 2019-01-04 22:06:01 Breaking News: US stocks surged Friday following one of the strongest jobs reports in recent memory as annual wages grew the most since 2008. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also gave investors an extra lift, saying the Fed will be patient when assessing the US economy.
255 2019-01-04 22:05:51 I want to work and like to work but my point is that a high tax rate is a disincentive to do so.  I feel that rn at close to 50%, can only imagine what 70 would do to me.

And you could invest all the money in stocks and pay low rates due to cap gains but that's different.
256 2019-01-04 22:05:51 Can we get someone to photoshop a picture of Ellen and Kevin Hart in the stocks in the town square please? Thanks in advance.
257 2019-01-04 22:05:45 A large part of his investing thesis is buying large cap stocks below book value that pay dividends and letting those dividends compound which buys him more stocks etc gold and BTC don’t pay dividends, plus btc is specialized tech and that’s outside his wheel house
258 2019-01-04 22:05:30 And there is a HUGE opportunity for insider trading when they deal with corporate lobbyists on a daily basis. No one who takes corporate campaign funds should be allowed to own stocks. This is why members of congress become multi-millionaires within just a few years. Corruption.
259 2019-01-04 22:05:30 He may have several targets correct. I could see short term rates up, the $ up, and stocks at new highs. However I disagree on gold.

261 2019-01-04 22:05:26 why is he forgetting that 9/11 happened in the air. from that perspective , the wall needs to be sky hi. Lets buy Steel stocks 
262 2019-01-04 22:05:19 What kind of "jobs"? Part-time, low paying jobs? Trump's tariffs are killing farmers, auto workers,and many other companies.  Stocks are down because they know layoffs and low-profit announcements are coming.  Trump simply amps up his racist cult members with calls for a "wall".
263 2019-01-04 22:05:07 Your money, your choice to hold or not.
264 2019-01-04 22:04:46 it's been one day of recovery. chill RB. stocks across the board are still way down since October
265 2019-01-04 22:04:38 What’s fake is your fraudulent treasonous Presidency. This wall is profit for you & your con group. Steel cost more than cement for one. It would take 70 billion not 5 billion your excuses are bullshit & there is no emergency. This is abuse of power!!! Stocks in steel right? BS!
266 2019-01-04 22:04:27 El estado con su mal gasto se endeudó dejando seco el crédito a los privados, q no pueden crecer y deben vender stocks para bajar capital involucrado. Baja el empleo y hace subir gasto del estado requiriendo más deuda. Mala Praxis de quien no sabe cómo funciona nuestra economía
267 2019-01-04 22:04:20 So “pro-constitution” republicans have been in office for just under two years, yet they haven’t made it any easier to legally own a firearm (in fact, they only banned bump stocks), Trump signed a bill to keep NSA spying, and the debt has risen to 21 trillion. They’re not helping
268 2019-01-04 22:03:39 2 trillion added to the deficit. Worst year ever for US stocks. LOSER...lol
269 2019-01-04 22:03:32 I’ve been teaching myself stocks and investing but  I’m still sooo confused

287 2019-01-04 21:59:07 Wow....looks like stocks getting hit after hours.
288 2019-01-04 21:58:48 Haha hope the local restaurant stocks it .full tin candle in the top .well a lot off candles
289 2019-01-04 21:58:29 but wouldn’t lower stocks need to happen first, thus dominant? unless one assumes realized equity move thus far was already enough to force a policy reversal?
290 2019-01-04 21:58:29 Anyone on here know how to trade stocks interested in learning?
291 2019-01-04 21:58:14 Broad rally for US stocks, DJIA back up 747 after yesterday's 660 pt drop. Looks like the end of the world is not arriving this week. Stay with quality. That lets you relax and take the long view. US economy still the best in the world, no other major economy comes close.
292 2019-01-04 21:55:30 Can’t wait bro, in need of a break without stocks constantly  on my mind
293 2019-01-04 21:55:29 Any law against the second amendment is treason. That includes bump stocks and red flag laws. Don’t throw up the white flag or back down on any laws.

295 2019-01-04 21:55:18 Honestly, the stock market isn’t the best way to gauge how an economy is doing, I was just pointing out that the stock market in the last month hasn’t been doing too well in comparison to the current spike in stocks.

Also, Obama’s numbers were comparable.. (1/2)

309 2019-01-04 21:48:19 Found myself wrapped in faux fur blankets while it stormed all last night and today and snoozing. Also watching the value of my stocks increase by over $900 after last month's drubbing was pleasant too.

Who’s with me?
321 2019-01-04 21:43:03 Market corrections are healthy!  Its same with stock mkt. Current bear mkt might go dwn another 10% but will offer big discounts on great stocks soon.
322 2019-01-04 21:43:02 Perhaps consider tweeting links to your Reddit commentary on stocks ... I generally avoid platforms other than Twitter because I can't afford the time drain they tend to become for me, but I'd certainly click links to read good info, just like I do with links to articles.
323 2019-01-04 21:42:30 #ImpeachTheMF
The longer the shutdown, the more damage that will be done. Not just in the U.S., but the rest of the world. We have already seen the impact the China Tarriffs have had on their economy. Just look at the damage it's done to Apple and other stocks.
324 2019-01-04 21:42:29 World stocks soar: US +3.4%; Europe +2.8%. Solid jobs report + FED reassurance spurred markets. Alert: rallies are often fierce in a market that significantly declined. It takes more than 1 rally to change market's pessimistic outlook due to China, Trump & slowing  world growth.

NEW YORK (AP) — Global stocks soared Friday and reversed the big losses they suffered just a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 746 points in the latest twist in a wild three months for markets.

333 2019-01-04 21:40:44 correct if you're a lay person and don't actually construct your portfolio....that said, if you do buy your own stocks and don't manage volatility or incorrect picks with capital preservation discipline you're a moron....so as always....the opposite can also be true....

339 2019-01-04 21:37:39 No need to figure it all out this weekend. If the market is settling down, quality stocks will start to show clear setups, trigger with volume, and follow thru.  We are still in the “show clear setups” stage of the analysis. 
Always better to be late than early 
340 2019-01-04 21:37:36 Thank you!  Lots of stocks pulled back to their 20ema.  May be an opportunity to buy some puts....

345 2019-01-04 21:35:18 not really 
If it still works but he dies first it won't be a huge issue 
Chrom can still get consistently early kills without it and it'd still be a good way to tie up stocks if you're behind.
346 2019-01-04 21:35:18 Similar to an IPO base. Many cryptos will pop when first listed, and fall into a listing base that can last anywhere from a few days to 6-18+ months before it breaks out (if ever). The first breakout from an IPO (stocks) or listing base (crypto) can be emphatic with a huge move.
347 2019-01-04 21:34:27 Hmmm we’ll see lol . I do enjoy racing dirt street stocks but not as much as ovals . But I imagine only because I’m not very good at it . I’ll give it a go eventually .
348 2019-01-04 21:34:13 Technical analysts believe that all known information is already priced into stocks and that patterns in the ups and downs of equity prices can better predict the market’s movements.

352 2019-01-04 21:31:51 Bro the original comment was a joke. The stocks are like this because of the seasonal jobs, and We’re finally making trade talk again with China. It was so funny watching Trump bow down to China after saying he was gonna be tough on them. He gave them what they wanted at G20
353 2019-01-04 21:30:57 Don't forget about the impacts of currency on your investments. An almost 1% rise in the CAD/USD today dampens the gains on U.S. stocks for us a little.

364 2019-01-04 21:28:31 Sort of. Bump firing is a shooting technique which allows the shooter to puller the trigger more frequently than traditional shooting techniques. Bump fire stocks are devices that assist in performing the technique which can also be done without any special equipment.

367 2019-01-04 21:27:36 That’s one possibility but strikes me as a particularly high risk play for Fed. What if stocks don’t go up? Powell’s gotta believe he really caused the selloff to bet that strategy works. I’m not sure he does...

371 2019-01-04 21:26:11 But I'm big on solidarity, and I want everybody to have the same freedom. So I might pay a little more in taxes than some others but if that means that they can have the same opportunities as me then I'm happy to do it.
372 2019-01-04 21:25:46 Are you dense? Do you think that ENTIRE stock Mkt rally from 11/0816-1/20/19 was a Farewell Love song due to Obama, or....as the stock Mkt is a forward looking indicator, anticipating actions to be take by Trump that would be beneficial to $AAPL & all stocks.
373 2019-01-04 21:25:40 Today's been crazy. So much to do. So much big shit coming this year, I have a feeling these stocks are going to go 3x 
374 2019-01-04 21:25:34 Hundreds of people gunned down at once with a bump stock. Conservatives still want bump stocks.

377 2019-01-04 21:24:04 Sort of... Bump stocks use the recoil of the gun to allow the stock to keep pulling the trigger over and over. It doesn’t change the mechanical function of the gun’s action at all. Think of it as a plastic finger that’s able to pull the trigger faster than your real finger.
378 2019-01-04 21:22:25 Watchlist for Monday $ACB $CRON $IGCC $AMRH $TTNP $IPCI $HSGX $CGIX $WDBG $HEMP $KALY $PURA most of these are on their first Green Day, so for Monday I'm looking find the best one or two and bring in 10-20%. #Stocks #FridayThoughts #PotStocks #Gains

382 2019-01-04 21:20:23 Oh now it’s 20 yrs?!?!  Cause you just said 2 yrs?!?!?  So which is it?!?  Cause during the Obama years it surged...the last two years, not so much.  We’re heading for a massive recession...goodluck with your stocks.
383 2019-01-04 21:20:10 Who audits stock market besides Trump's SEC?

How do we know the true value of all stocks? Sure balance sheets but who actually confirms those sheets are actually balanced?

Who audits investors? Where does their funding come from?
384 2019-01-04 21:19:56 Soaring? I’ve lost 15% value of all of my stocks over the past month (not counting my 401K). I think you need to learn the meaning of that word.
385 2019-01-04 21:19:40 Maybe but those companies (stocks) with outsized debt will have to pay a lot more for money today ......... not good for earnings..
386 2019-01-04 21:19:17 Stocks as investment in long term.
387 2019-01-04 21:18:54 Todays hot take:

Trying to compare how stocks traded in 1929 is like comparing an eBay listing to a cattle auction.
388 2019-01-04 21:18:44 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Neutrals are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  REV stocks. Thank you for tuning into  Fox.
389 2019-01-04 21:18:02 Crushed this week shorting the chop for the past 5 days. Over positioned my trades I see why you should never risk more than 2% per trade so you can survive the bad streaks. Even 4-5% is too much  #trading #stocks always learning!
390 2019-01-04 21:17:23 Gun twitter: bump-fire stocks modify a semiautomatic weapon into one able to fire shots more frequently, not faster, correct
391 2019-01-04 21:17:22 But you willingly let the ATF ban bump stocks....BOYCOTT THE NRA SUPPORT THE GOA !
392 2019-01-04 21:17:14 Stocks rallied today as the Dow gains over 730 points. Story coming up yet this afternoon.
393 2019-01-04 21:17:13 Long 3 stocks over the weekend, mr trump if you could not say some dumb shit to trigger Wall Street this weekend it would be greatly appreciated
394 2019-01-04 21:16:48 Invested in @Mattel stocks. Let see how these hoes roll. @KarlKinnamon
395 2019-01-04 21:16:41 For this we get free healthcare, education + pay during, subsidized childcare + subsidies per child, state pension and more. I know many of you think that with this system, your freedom to choose gets taken away. And that might be true for people, who can afford it.
396 2019-01-04 21:16:35 #stocks pop as $DJI $SPX and $RUT all close up over 3% and $NDX gains over 4% while #gold sells off after testing $1300. Join Coach Frank over on YouTube at 4:30 Eastern to discuss the day's price action in the Market Recap #trading
397 2019-01-04 21:16:22 I just can’t. I agree they might help the needy which is great but they help the wrong people too much I’m afraid. I just want us 1st. Imported space labour and a lack of jobs for us and companies allowed to up stocks and go abroad yet import on the cheap. Corruption all over.
398 2019-01-04 21:16:01 B.S. as companies stocks are plummeting! The stock market is unsettled by your rhetoric & mismanagement! You better enjoy this last 2 years if you aren't impeached before then! We don't want a crook in the WH surrounded by crooks!
399 2019-01-04 21:15:52 I favor buying the investment companies buying cannabis stocks. They are trading at a discount.
400 2019-01-04 21:15:37 Well, stocks basically never had a down day in 2017, even with three hikes + beginning balance sheet rolloff. Don't see that happening again.

But, agree, one way out could be some give and take. Smart investors would wise up to that pretty quickly, though.
401 2019-01-04 21:15:20 Mike - I like you and enjoy your commentary but... You basically just said the longer stocks stay down, the longer they won’t go up.. and if they don’t quickly go up, they could stay down for longer. Hard to disagree with that!!
402 2019-01-04 21:15:19 If stocks are up on Monday, the bulls will be on a winning streak of..um,...2 consecutive wins.
403 2019-01-04 21:15:04 Blowout #Jobs #JobsReport & #FederalReserve Powell not as likely to raise rates help RALLY #stocks covering big moves on @SpecialReport tonight $dji $spy $ndq
404 2019-01-04 21:14:59 $nflx is your best bellwether stock for risk appetite, it sent you strong sell signal to get out of stocks on October 16-17 after ER and now last couple of days it says get back in stocks, $spx
405 2019-01-04 21:14:30 Just need to find right stocks at right valuations. I love been eyeing one up. Just one mind you.
406 2019-01-04 21:14:06 But if you were holding waiting for real estate to drop now stocks have also dropped so you have to extend your time on sidelines or take the loss. Either way it's a waiting game for many and fewer buyers as FIVRE suggested.
407 2019-01-04 21:13:55 #BuildTheWall2019 It’s simple. The Democrats lies to their base. The day they took office the stocks went down, @realDonaldTrump tweets and it goes up, way up. Republicans stand by @realDonaldTrump or you all will be sitting with the Democrats. We MAGA!! 
408 2019-01-04 21:13:47 Stocks just had their best day since last week...
409 2019-01-04 21:13:28 Señor economista, que dice de la inflación en cada uno de esos paises? Porque no aprovecha taaanto conocimiento y le explica a su jefe lo de los Stocks...ud si sabe que son no!?
410 2019-01-04 21:13:27 All you have is a bunch of “short sellers” bashing tweets w/ no facts. I’ll gladly be patient and tell you that you’re wrong. But then again you’re the same dummy who RT your rant about $grat from Dec 18 and the stocks gone from .105 to .15! What idiot would listen to you?

412 2019-01-04 21:12:35 I don't know.  When the 10 yr yield went toward 3.25 % in Oct,  high beta stocks started to puke just like they did in '99-2000 when high interest rates rattled them too.   Be careful what you wish for I guess.   Cheers

414 2019-01-04 21:09:57 Stocks fluctuate. That's their nature.
 Your young journalists fresh after schools of journalism know very little about free market and real life.
415 2019-01-04 21:09:44 CBOE SKEW INDEX, a measure of perceived tail risk in #stocks, falls to 2014's lows. $SPX
416 2019-01-04 21:09:07 I would like to read this book as an interested novice in the stocks market, though the book seems suitable for seasoned stock market participants. This is great financial investment advice from a person well versed in the industry.
417 2019-01-04 21:08:32 The Dow has now surged 1,641 points, or 8%, since Christmas Eve. #stocks

419 2019-01-04 21:08:01 The #jobgrowth is not of your doing.
Due to the change you're pursuing,
Stocks are all up and down,
And you are such a clown,
You can't see the system ungluing.
420 2019-01-04 21:07:44 High volume pennys, I loooove cheap tech stocks, I have this pattern iv been playing with on paper for a while. Been working so far.
421 2019-01-04 21:07:39 Some people lost their life savings in the failure of Showcase Revue stocks around the same time. #LateNightNipples
422 2019-01-04 21:07:00 Stocks surged, with the S&P 500 rising more than 3% Friday, after the jobs report and the Fed chairman both reassured investors.
Now w all the prosperity lets balance our budget, reinforce border, reform Immigration, cut entitlement spending & cut Natl debt.Its unsustainable. Duh
423 2019-01-04 21:06:52 Unemployment went up. You added over $2 trillion to national debt in less than 2 years. Wages are stagnant except for the wealthy 1-2%. Stocks are unsteady from one day to the next. Domestic terrorism is on a significant increase, as is healthcare costs/prescription medications!
424 2019-01-04 21:06:48 I know it's not my discussion since I'm not American, but I'd like to offer some perspective from my country: we pay aprox. 50-60% of our income in different taxes. Few very rich people choose to leave. I guess bc there are more to life and love of country than money?
425 2019-01-04 21:06:36 So real economy is strong (NFP). But Powell is dovish if economy is bad, so stocks up.  But economy’s good so will be rate hikes. Which stocks don’t like. 
426 2019-01-04 21:06:13 Stocks are up. Great jobs #s
Give a chimp a job
427 2019-01-04 21:06:11 Stocks surge after robust jobs report and dovish Powell remarks
428 2019-01-04 21:05:03 Does it really need to be said yet again? 250 million people are NOT "on the move."
Time for IRIN to grasp the simple difference between stocks and flows!
429 2019-01-04 21:04:57 EM stocks look interesting. May see new entry there. But otherwise no change for me. $RGLD only position. Long cash and patience. Good w/e.
430 2019-01-04 21:04:47 ouais faut juste faire gaffe à ses stocks de thé quoi
431 2019-01-04 21:04:38 Stocks close with big gains on strong Jobs Report, Powell's dovish remarks. Dow +750 points.
432 2019-01-04 21:04:25 Stocks surged, the $USD weakened and #Treasuries tumbled with #gold as a risk-on tone gripped financial markets after #investors got good news on the #economy, Federal Reserve @federalreserve policy and trade tensions!
433 2019-01-04 21:03:28 I mean the only good thing about it, would be better opponents. But I agree for all that time spent you could probably learn a new language, learn to invest stocks, and write a book, lol.
434 2019-01-04 21:03:16 @realDonaldTrump you've done a great job, Mr. President. I wonder where was the people during the past 2 years that the market was up tremendously in 20 years, even when it was down, still up.  I know because I have money in stocks over the last 20 years.
435 2019-01-04 21:02:00 i got bonds not stocks. that’s how u save
436 2019-01-04 21:01:15 The Rich steel the stocks, they put lots of money into companies get their money back and steel the rest in stock.
437 2019-01-04 21:01:05 I see no issue with a CEO or other top executive averaging around €500,000 as base pay. Having said that, any more than that is outrageous since most CEO's ALSO benefit from numerous other perks such as stocks, vacations, etc....adding €5-20M!

439 2019-01-04 21:00:55 Nice 2 read more Bullish posts on Twitter rather than everyone slagging eachother off . I suspect this is due to the Mkt and particular stocks doing very well which is good for everyone and good for Tops as I’m back at my desk Thursday & we can have some multi-Baggers in 2019 
440 2019-01-04 21:00:54 I currently have no positions for apple. Thinking if nows a good time to buy or should I purchase more stocks in TESLA? 
441 2019-01-04 21:00:50 You need to check yourself into a looney pin. You have no brain  what so ever. Your a very sick person who needs help and shouldn't be In charge of this country . You have caused so much chaos and are killing our people out of their retirements. Stocks is down because of you. 
442 2019-01-04 21:00:45 Nothing you have said even provides value or discredits anything to do with any stocks... it just exemplifies that you are just like all the other idiots on here. Thanks for proving my point.
443 2019-01-04 21:00:37 and today's rise in stocks was due in fair part to Powell stating that he won't resign if requested to do so by President Trump.

446 2019-01-04 20:59:32 Let’s see under Obama, stocks went from 8,000-16,000 total per day in office + 2.75. Under Trump from 16,000 to 23,000 total per day in office +9.50. These numbers are rounded out but I think you can see Trump Whoops Obama perty good.
447 2019-01-04 20:59:09 For expert investors only: periods of 3% daily swings in the #SPX are always a precursor to big falls, never to big rises. #stocks
448 2019-01-04 20:57:59 hard to know...its structurally fucked but bulls are dumb and there is tons of dumb money comparing stocks to their ATHs and counting $$$. This can go on most of January.
449 2019-01-04 20:57:30 You guys are funny. From AP yesterday --

BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
450 2019-01-04 20:56:41 Gold stocks don’t give a shit by gold pullback. 
451 2019-01-04 20:56:24 Is that like seizing legally purchased rifle stocks or magazines with capacities greater than X rounds?
452 2019-01-04 20:56:23 one of my Chipotle coworkers:

"I like to celebrate the holiday of a certain man breaking into people houses & leaves behind boxes, and stocks you throughout the year to see if you are naughty or nice."
453 2019-01-04 20:55:59 Oh Charles Gasolin, stocks up made U went nuts  #CharlesGasparino @FoxBusiness @LizClaman
454 2019-01-04 20:55:33 If I let u hit ya stocks up  bout to take off like a rocket I ain’t talking stocked up!
455 2019-01-04 20:55:04 Not when bonds are overvalued and stocks are undervalued.  Imho
456 2019-01-04 20:54:52 2 stocks red today and about 30 green l, I hope this is a sign of things to come in 2019.
457 2019-01-04 20:54:21 Heading into the 4:00 p.m. ET closing bell, Stocks holding solid gains reversing yesterday's steep losses. Dow +750 points.
458 2019-01-04 20:53:37 I see all $XLV, $XLK, $XLF, $XLI are still nice on daily chart. So keep in your mind to seek good stocks like health stocks, technology stocks, finance stocks, industrial stocks for next week
459 2019-01-04 20:53:24 $SPY The $VIX Is better in my opinion as a fear indicator and not so much for viewing the volatility on stocks/market. $STUDY
460 2019-01-04 20:53:14 Only ones thats own stocks are the rich CEOs, large corporations, and Wall Street. Not a true economy for the working- class American.
461 2019-01-04 20:52:07 Mayoria de sectores y stocks que sigo estan en la zona de la oferta. Todavia seguimos en un Bear Market asi que el processo es el mismo nada ha cambiado. Cuando el mercado cambie nosotros cambiamos con el. Ambiente complicado para los swing traders.
462 2019-01-04 20:51:08 if jobs surge it‘s your economy, if stocks fall it‘s dems (even before they are in power). You‘re such a poor cherry picker...
463 2019-01-04 20:51:06 Ça arrive souvent que certains produits apparaissent sur le site avant voir après car gérés différemment et les stocks sont parfois différent aussi (stocks des boutiques physiques par exemple)
464 2019-01-04 20:50:48 What stocks show the vol surge
465 2019-01-04 20:50:29 A Few Recent Walk ins :) Spot anybody you know?

*******Alot of you have been using them...dont forget while stocks last you get a Free 10% LOYALTY DISCOUNT VOUCHER with any piercing *****
466 2019-01-04 20:50:14 But you realize, that the reason the stocks have skyrocketed today it’s because they have plummeted precipitously so much since October, largely due to the impulsive actions of Trump and his fed chairman
467 2019-01-04 20:49:57 #risk sentiment is going up heading into the end of the week - European as well as US stocks are firmer which is in line with the #forexmarket : $JPY , $CHF are weaker and the $USD broadly lower.

Good luck and good trading !

469 2019-01-04 20:49:48 On our product roadmap for sure. We're planning to introduce international stocks and fundamentals before we work on a screener
470 2019-01-04 20:48:27 $GTEC.V $GGTTF $GENE.V giving the market asymmetrical risk opportunities. This will be one hell of a play going forward. Looking forward to hearing more details in regards to the merger. Should move both stocks higher IMO.
471 2019-01-04 20:47:54 Marijuana stocks taking the day off with money pouring into oversold conditions elsewhere. Give it a couple of days and I think the curl back upward resumes. An amazing day for everything else I own.

474 2019-01-04 20:46:27 Not just Obama, but just about every lib friend of mine, too.  They also said to sell all stocks after the election...lol...this data has to be killing them.  But watch BHO take credit for something he said was impossible.
475 2019-01-04 20:46:24 Ohhh shit I’m up today time to move some stocks around just know I stayed down till we came up 
476 2019-01-04 20:44:57 It would only take 107 more days like today before stocks reach Dow 100,000.
477 2019-01-04 20:44:51 BREAKING!!!    Breadwinner will be back in this bitch slanging stocks before the end of the month.   I can't sit out and let you motherfuckers have all the fun w/ so much volatility.    Lets get rich bitches.... again.

480 2019-01-04 20:43:55 I dont sell stocks, but I do ok.  Top 3% income.  Not bad for a beaner.
481 2019-01-04 20:43:45 Government shuts down , stocks go back up 
482 2019-01-04 20:43:14 sure....those on sidelines holding stocks, now have to extend their real estate #BuyersStrike. 
Less buyers = well....you know.
483 2019-01-04 20:42:25 Take a look at today’s jobs numbers. Stocks go up and down all the time. Did you really think the Dow was going to continue to grow to 30,000? 50,000?
484 2019-01-04 20:41:07 Methinks some gold bugs want your stocks to collapse, because they believe that's the only way that they can sell their gold at a much higher price.

485 2019-01-04 20:40:50 That’s true. The communication, networking & collaboration that can be done now is incredible. I remember a guy who got this Compuserve thing. Connected it to your phone line & you could get sports scores, weather & stocks on this little green screen thing! Couldn’t believe it!!
486 2019-01-04 20:39:50 What consitutional crisis are you referring to? I am really curious who and what you are referring to. Considering @DNC want to do away with the #2A and ban bump stocks. Limit free speech on others but it is okay for them to say whatever. It’s also okay with them to break laws!
487 2019-01-04 20:39:28 Listen, I've got a few stocks I'd like you to talk up. Just till their up 10 or 12 percent.
488 2019-01-04 20:38:52 They tell us Wall Street ups and downs are emotionally driven. I think it’s billionaire investors “timing” the market. They make millions in a single transaction and send the market into chaos. We should require stocks be held for a some time before resale just like mutual funds.
489 2019-01-04 20:38:48 its not home bias-and I am merely posing the contrast as stocks start to trade less as a unit and more individually driven by the skew in earnings, profitability that we can now identify.  There are undervalued LPs and MSOs and overpriced ones on both sides.
490 2019-01-04 20:38:30 I think politicians should be prohibited from owning socks!

491 2019-01-04 20:38:11 We are corrupt, we are terrorists but come and invest in our country. Only an idiot like IK can do this. Results: USD530mln gone from stock exchange alone , foreign reserves down by $4bln, stocks down by 20000, rupee down by 35%, exports, revenues all down.
492 2019-01-04 20:37:44 Stocks are up today .
493 2019-01-04 20:37:31 Time to buy stocks in 3M Bondo.
494 2019-01-04 20:37:25 Anything. I will listen. Start with, I don't know, the economy, deficit, stocks...I promise, I'm listening.
495 2019-01-04 20:37:19 I hope Apple move pass through this phase.. Their stocks are dropping real bad...
496 2019-01-04 20:36:54 I see that Bull, but that makes zero sense..to me anyway
497 2019-01-04 20:36:49 stocks are going up, yaass
498 2019-01-04 20:36:48 This would help, not hurt, because taxes paid to the government are spent and recirculated to the economy. The Very Rich can only buy so many yachts so, past a certain point, they just invest the excess in property, stocks, and bonds which are largely economically unproductive.
499 2019-01-04 20:36:14 I don't have any exposure to US stocks - too expensive & better value elsewhere. I have two US-focused ITs on my watchlist - PCT & NAIT. Both charts don't inspire confidence. CGI (Canadian) similarly also looks like it's heading further south.
500 2019-01-04 20:35:58 The beginning of this chart (2000) started with gold down around 60% and SPX up around 12 fold in the 20yrs since 1980. Same chart then would have stated that stocks crushed gold (by a lot!), having no implication whatsoever on future returns (other than warning of overvaluation)
501 2019-01-04 20:34:45 Next fang stocks: $SQ $OSTK but yes why throw money at #Fidelity so they can turn around and fuq you over and still have no true ownership and multi day settlement so they can fuq you over again for good measure. Nonsense
502 2019-01-04 20:34:39 Why do these people think everyone in CA is a dem?
If they were we would have never had Issa, Rohrabacher, Nunes, Mccarthy, Calvert, Hunter etc.
It's such an uninformed argument.
503 2019-01-04 20:33:08 312,000 jobs were added overall in the month of December so it affected all stocks

505 2019-01-04 20:32:28 #powell Never happy. He did everything asked of him and now he needs to be advising on stocks as well...
506 2019-01-04 20:31:29 Oh, the look of absolute arrogance on @SenKamalaHarris face is priceless. It is also a good indicator of the direction (downward) the Dems are about to take this country. I should have shifted my 401K to all bonds as I'm sure my stocks are about to crash for the next two years.
507 2019-01-04 20:30:25 And put the parents who have failed them in stocks outside.
508 2019-01-04 20:30:04 Fact that market jumped (Nasdaq 4%) is the need for cheap money to inflate stocks at high pe's and forward(2020 & 2021). Q1 earnings will be the real indicator and any stock that has direct or indirect exposure to China will be mulled. $AAPL $CAT $BA
509 2019-01-04 20:29:40 @realDonaldTrump U.S. steel companies should decline to bid on any contract that would involved providing their steel for a border wall. All employee investment portfolios and investment banks should refuse to hold stocks in any company which chooses to supply steel to this wall.
510 2019-01-04 20:28:51 Very few stocks setting up that I can see.
511 2019-01-04 20:28:49 Is it possible that Trump or family just bought loads of stocks in steel companies?
512 2019-01-04 20:28:45 When USD currency crisis goes down and stocks go parabolic (eg Argentina Zimbabwe) what will understanding of public be?  Stock market is so engrained in popular psyche in US. People conditioned to think high markets are good. How will disconnect drive behavior and perception?
513 2019-01-04 20:28:34 Good spot to buy as many tech stocks as possible at any price for the 3:30 ramp and Monday morning premarket ramp

515 2019-01-04 20:27:40 Sensitive about this Grat garbage are we? You and I both know it’s just one of sheldons many pump and dumps. Some are are just trying to let other sheeple know how to stay away from Twitter hyped stocks. Don’t take it so personal.
516 2019-01-04 20:27:02 THE FIRST WEEK OF THE YEAR WE MADE 27.25 AND LOOKING TO MAKE OVER % THIS MONTH . WE SOLD $RARX WITH 4.6% GAIN $PKE WITH 12.8% GAIN $USM WITH 3.8%  GAIN $DG 6.05% TOTAL 27.25 . STILL HOLDING SOME GREAT STOCKS .
517 2019-01-04 20:26:50 My gut says that Xmas did not mark the low in U.S. stocks this year. Part of what wears down bulls is not the losses but the time spent below the old highs. People are not mentally marking down their portfolios down b/c many have not experienced a bear...
518 2019-01-04 20:26:22 For me, the kind of freedom I get in research is huge. But it would be a much harder transition to make if I had children to support - especially if I hadn't gotten that tech stocks windfall.

521 2019-01-04 20:24:41 Exactly but he doesn’t see it that way why use common sense and out law bump stocks ban assault weapons block domestic assault offenders from owning guns & other common sense measures when it’s so much easier to say “there is nothing you can do “ We need to stop the gun carnage
522 2019-01-04 20:23:36 Just picked up some more $Grat

Had to utilize my tax free savings account all three stocks have now been average down.

523 2019-01-04 20:23:05 Ah! You don’t understand what a quote is. Fair enough no point trying to have a conversation with you. 

If we do have a hard Brexit, hopefully nobody you love needs medicine and your food stocks are secure. 

Have a good evening.
524 2019-01-04 20:22:13 Seems we have confirmation in stocks volatility of late. But I think the trend is 
525 2019-01-04 20:21:41 Hi, sorry to hear that! What happened to it? 
Back to your original question, sadly the PS Store only delivers digital goods, so it's best to check with your preferred retailers as they'll have the most accurate info on stocks. ^NL
526 2019-01-04 20:20:56 Which is precisely why it will matter far sooner than most think possible, particularly if stocks don’t return to ATH ASAP and then rise on low vol from there, forevermore
527 2019-01-04 20:20:13 craziest week in stocks
528 2019-01-04 20:19:58 Thanks Apple for taking my phone for a week and doing absolutely nothing to it and sending me that same BROKEN phone back (the same phone that hasn’t been working for a month and I’ve only have it for 2). No wonder your stocks dropped so much. Rotten company is what you are

531 2019-01-04 20:17:50 Hardly any growth stocks moving higher w/ volume today. Disappointing on such a strong up session!
532 2019-01-04 20:17:48 FD, no items, 4 stocks,  8 minutes, Fox only
533 2019-01-04 20:17:23 Never buy put options and never short stocks,
Dangerous on big up days, surprise investors.

535 2019-01-04 20:16:27 @CNBCClosingBell everything is fixed. Don't raise rates and stop selling off the balance sheet. Back to pumping up stocks beyond reasonable levels and blowing up the debt with low taxes on the rich. @BruceBartlett @RBReich @jimcramer @paulkrugman @tomfriedman @HalftimeReport
536 2019-01-04 20:16:24 That's why I am buying drugstore stocks!
537 2019-01-04 20:16:17 Stocks Soar


538 2019-01-04 20:15:28 I agree. try to make something that you like. like try mixing different shapes to make something else. or make a letter logo. BUT DONT USE STOCKS
539 2019-01-04 20:15:21 supply and demand for shares to borrow, depends on the stock and brokerage firm, some stocks are cheaper and some brokerage firms are cheaper (especially if you have an account there).  Stock loan desks essentially trade this process.
540 2019-01-04 20:15:15 You might want to dump your Cemex stocks...........
541 2019-01-04 20:15:10 .   Making stocks drop?  I can’t believe it
542 2019-01-04 20:15:01 Reckon it's their attempt to cut down on food waste by making sure the stocks run down by the end of the week! 
543 2019-01-04 20:14:36 Excuse me @AliVelshi After the Presser we just saw, you go to the Stock Mkt? Really? Most Americans do not own stocks. Most Americans worry about their next paychecks AND the Maniac who JUST had a Presser full of god damn lies!! Just stop!! Click!
544 2019-01-04 20:14:34 That has been the story of late . Entire market behaving like penny stocks. 3-4% moves

546 2019-01-04 20:14:07 I'm going to inform you, that I'm going for a trip to big city tomorrow. I've been given an opportunity to finally get the Nintendo Switch. Here's hoping the stores there didn't run out their stocks of Switches then. UvU (1/2)
547 2019-01-04 20:13:45 شكرا  لك
548 2019-01-04 20:13:43 My daughter heard he has stocks in steel.  Now he's talking about making a wall out of steel.  Little bit of profit for him?   Hmmm....???
549 2019-01-04 20:13:26 Ya buddy... a steel see through fence... way to bump up steel industry stocks.
Uhm a little side note... steel fences corrode over time and would cost insane taxpayer money to maintain. 
But what the heck....
No deal on the fence....
550 2019-01-04 20:12:50 It sounds like that 
551 2019-01-04 20:11:40 2 long years hearing about this constitutional crisis were in... CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IT IS? The only crisis I see is the democrat parties false claims of Collusion. USA Unemployment down, stocks up, GDP up, N.Korea peace to name a few, Our country is prospering you fools.
552 2019-01-04 20:10:55 i read this as socks instead of stocks and let me tell you i was so confused 
553 2019-01-04 20:10:53 Per Trump, its Mad Max territory at the border because they are driving through desert dunes & ravines, through the river, through fences & farmland. On the US side everyone’s real scared but doing great with their stocks & golf course memberships & high-paying jobs & healthcare
554 2019-01-04 20:10:19 I didn’t ignore it I gave you facts that answered your question , job growth hasn’t slowed , unemployment is at a record low , and corporate buying back stocks has to do with what for employment numbers and bnp growth going up by 2.7% ?
555 2019-01-04 20:10:05 Soooooo then AR15 assault weapons  of war & bump stocks will be outlawed, for the safety of our Country?????????
556 2019-01-04 20:09:52 I go out thinking about some hotel... switch it to The Press to give Eric’s stocks a boost.
557 2019-01-04 20:08:43 I’ll be 66 next December and very close to retiring - IF I have any investment money left after the stocks are done with me. 
558 2019-01-04 20:08:38 Bro this shit brazy #stocks going up! Keep the government shit down a little bit longer!
559 2019-01-04 20:07:38 Wall Street remains strong after Trumps @POTUS press conference - in the conflict about mexican wall he is ready for a government shutdown that lasts a year #stocks #wallstreet #trump
560 2019-01-04 20:07:35 LATE CYCLE 10+ years

Cheap Stocks?

or

Cheap VIX?

With Trump as our President digging a bigger debt hole... I'll buy cheap VIX 100%
561 2019-01-04 20:07:29 They wouldn’t even with a total popular vote
562 2019-01-04 20:07:24 No problem. People will be so sick with worry at losing their job they won’t feel hungry. Even if you’re in a job food stocks may run low. That’s when the government will ram “Will Of The People” so far down our throats we’ll be sated until Seaborne Freight sails to our rescue!
563 2019-01-04 20:07:03 I believe more filings will come within the next 90 days. In general, I believe all #Marijuana & #Hemps stocks is a buy and hold, the industry as a whole will explode like it did several years back. This is a great opp, 

new sector = new millionaires

ALL IMO @TradingTeacher
564 2019-01-04 20:06:25 Unlike real billionaires his only experience w stocks was his casino stock & doesn’t understand oil prices as everything is supply/demand
565 2019-01-04 20:06:10 Thank you for making stocks go up bigly today
566 2019-01-04 20:05:46 Steel and concrete stocks surging along with the rest of the market. But they essentially just got nearly an hour's worth of free advertising from Trump...which they sorely need since the 12-month chart isn't as pretty as today's. $X $AKS $CLF $USCR $MLM $VMC
567 2019-01-04 20:05:24 As usual with all her stocks!,  knew her for long time! her tweets/posts always followed by massive dumping (ASCM-CANT-OTCX-VERT)
568 2019-01-04 20:05:10 You're like the only one I follow who also does stocks and I appreciate that.
569 2019-01-04 20:04:47 Incredible day in the market. Numerous stocks out there are having their best day since December 26.
570 2019-01-04 20:04:28 Lmao “ . If you understand stocks then you will know an RS does not hurt your position it #helps” that has to be the stupid comment I’ve heard a ceo say
571 2019-01-04 20:04:12 It's still greed, people looking for ROI. The point I'm trying to make is, it's better to tax the super wealthy and give the bottom % tax breaks & benefits. It increases revenue bc poor ppl have to spend the $$ to buy neccessities vs billions who just buy back their own stocks
572 2019-01-04 20:03:41 The Three Red Lines:

-Gun control laws (regs banning bump stocks don’t count)

-Judges who aren’t rock-solid anti-Roe

-Tax increases
573 2019-01-04 20:03:35 im mostly interested in stocks and IRAs but open to any
574 2019-01-04 20:03:27 Since late 2017, the Fed has been paying off that debt (which equates to draining money out of the system).  They're down from $4.5 trillion to about $4.1 trillion now.  So, still a long way to go.  Assets must be sold to raise cash, hence stocks face selling pressure from this.
575 2019-01-04 20:03:02 Trump winning in terms of jobs. The report on jobs is very good. 312 000 jobs created surpassing the predictions of Economists and U.S. stocks have rallied...Trump fielding questions without henchmen filtering the questions on CNN.
576 2019-01-04 20:02:51 At midday, Mortgage Bonds lower as Stocks skyrocket on jobs data, Powell's somewhat dovish words. 10-yr yield 2.67%.
577 2019-01-04 20:02:50 Yesterday Headline (Barrons)Dow drops 519 points because the market has bigger problems than just Apple

Stop this motherf*****, I want to get off!
578 2019-01-04 20:02:49 *stocks drops*
579 2019-01-04 20:02:32 Anything more than $5 is more than I want to spend on single stocks at this stage of my life. I'll stick to losing $100 on movie pass and my other meme stocks.
580 2019-01-04 20:02:08 Closed out all my positions bar $IMMU which I will hold into next week. $SPY struggling to break 20ema so lots of stocks pulling back right now, protecting my gains and let’s see how monday opens. Nice solid gains for me today another $173 banked on this $5k challenge.
581 2019-01-04 20:01:53 At 3 PM today NASDAQ stocks are up about 4% but the DTYS ETF (which shorts 10-year Treasury Bonds) is up 7%.  I haven't liked bonds for a long time. Bond shorts are another matter.
582 2019-01-04 20:01:30 I got out of stocks after losing my shirt in 2008 and now invested in rental homes at least I control my assets
583 2019-01-04 20:01:22 It's underweight us stocks too though
584 2019-01-04 20:01:15 I thought it was from the leather stocks they used to wear, collars
585 2019-01-04 20:00:48 Like I will keep saying... You wait to buy stocks super cheap, or VIX cheap in a late cycle market like this
586 2019-01-04 20:00:35 Saw a chart. Volume is about 1/2 for most of the big name stocks.
587 2019-01-04 20:00:21 Exams were never my thing really. *Stocks up on Pot Noodles*
588 2019-01-04 20:00:18 Bump stocks are stupid but that doesn’t give the President or the ATF the authority to unilaterally change the interpretation and execution of legislation
589 2019-01-04 19:59:29 @freetrade when are you hoping to release the new American stocks?
590 2019-01-04 19:59:00 Success for regular people and speculators and investors keeps widening, during allot of Obama stocks did perfectly fine though unemployment still pretty high and stagment wages, the trade disputes are lowering stocks, but people here are being employed more.
591 2019-01-04 19:58:29 Non, on peut taxer les flux et les stocks. Vue le niveau des inégalités de patrimoine. Il faut faire les deux.
592 2019-01-04 19:58:12 It’s an investment. Look at any pension plan, bonds, stocks. All have foreign investments as part of their portfolios. Is there a risk? Sure. There’s a risk with any investment...
593 2019-01-04 19:58:09 Did I hear Trump say “the stocks have gone up one hundreds of percents”
594 2019-01-04 19:58:03 Donald Trump's just said he told apple to make they phones in US and they didn't so he basically don't care about they stocks 
595 2019-01-04 19:58:00 Meanwhile our stocks are falling the longer he speaks.
596 2019-01-04 19:57:59 A 20 p/e uptick every 10 years on stocks may seem normal for most that have been raised in #cubicles
but for all the ones that were raised in and around common sense and real reality without having to look into a pair of fucking goggles surely knows its how fucking crooks make $s
597 2019-01-04 19:57:56 2:30 p.m. unreal  66 stocks hit my main scanner so far
how can we follow so many breaking or retesting recent highs in a timely manner
perhaps gotta rethink my approach

598 2019-01-04 19:57:33 No I'm not joking. Mitt Romney made 20 million dollars in stocks and paid basically no income tax for it. If you think that's hard work screw off.
599 2019-01-04 19:57:07 Bob Ross knows stocks 
600 2019-01-04 19:56:56 M&A in rage? already 4 r-mergers: $OHRP, $FLKS, $APHB, $MBVX, and a mega merger of $CELG. After 2018, stocks look cheap :-). should be good for 2019.
601 2019-01-04 19:56:51 I wonder how it will influence the stocks? 
602 2019-01-04 19:56:32 I was told it originated in the UK. When someone was put in the stocks, they would write the crime above their head. "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" was way too long, so the acronym F.U.C.K. was born.

604 2019-01-04 19:56:16 Finally stocks rebound a little 
605 2019-01-04 19:56:15 Stocks have gone up 30% since trump.took office. Fact. Unemployment lowest in 50 years. Fact. Wage growth 3.2% biggest in 14 years. Fact. Minority unemployment lowest EVER. fact. You said what again Miss I own stock so I think that makes me sound smart...
606 2019-01-04 19:55:40 Hindi permanent ang stocks, minsan mataas, minsan bumababa. Kaya lang parang tumaas yan dahil siguro, bumagsak ng 50%, ngayon ano ang pagmmalaki sa 4% up? Wala rin.
607 2019-01-04 19:55:06 My stocks are plummeting; I blame the instability caused by this bankrupt actor
608 2019-01-04 19:54:41 Another $25 million in outflows in $PFF yesterday.  That ETF continues to have outflows nearly everyday since November 1st.  Already $60 million in outflows in 2019 - who is driving up the price of all these preferred stocks?
609 2019-01-04 19:54:18 @chcustomstocks Chris hi do you still do custom stocks for a Daystate Pulsar?
610 2019-01-04 19:54:04 I play with stocks for a living, Rick. I'm trying to boost your pharma stocks by causing headaches!
611 2019-01-04 19:53:30 I own several stocks in different segments, thus follow the market and it’s not true. The economic growth has remained low, lower then when under Obama. Deficit has risen, by more than $1 trillion, running on the skirt of the last administration doesn’t count.

616 2019-01-04 19:52:27 There's legit a guy at this gym who's either having a phonecall board meeting or buying/selling stocks every time I see him. That's success baby.
617 2019-01-04 19:52:21 Any of y’all trade stocks?

619 2019-01-04 19:52:04 Lesson learned by quants at Putnam in mid-1970 -- beta alone isn't enough; you need alpha. Beta stocks bounce and fizzle; alpha stocks bounce (but not as spectacularly) but then keep going.
620 2019-01-04 19:51:48 SAAS stocks +6%
621 2019-01-04 19:51:09 Uhhh it's awful. I trade stocks so I know.
622 2019-01-04 19:50:58 Mot been trading for a year. I’m bout to be linking with him and getting my grind on. Stocks be long term investments and it be hard to get your money to fold to profit
623 2019-01-04 19:50:46 Still some very sick people out there .Would be nice to catch them and place the in the stocks in the Market place
624 2019-01-04 19:50:39 Tokenized stocks solve the problem of rehypothecation where hundreds think they actually own the same stock but do not. Opening up new industry of tokenized stocks custodial solutions. The only weak link is that it’s on Ethereum which has proven to deliver failure after another
625 2019-01-04 19:49:23 Ok so I hope nobody listened last night when I said to sell stocks and run around and panic.
626 2019-01-04 19:48:44 Which could mean he keeps raising rates as long as stocks stay above the lows.
627 2019-01-04 19:47:11 So it’s not enough that a sh!t load of people got killed and maimed by a guy who used bump stocks?

633 2019-01-04 19:45:42 Also also: we already *do* carry their health care burden, through premium payments. That’s how private health insurance works, unless you think every dollar you pay is earmarked for your care.
634 2019-01-04 19:45:30 Very interesting. Just scanned stocks that had good mention in IBD last several weeks. They are doing nothing. And if they are moving, they are moving on very low volume. That can change. But for now: squishy.

641 2019-01-04 19:44:36 Yep tokenized stocks on ethereum is without question a trainwreck in slow motion. That’s why I recommend scalping tickets to board the train & waving those greedy suckers goodbye as you walk away counting gainz in slow motion as a huge fireball consumes them all behind you

643 2019-01-04 19:44:27 Stocks preparing, what souls!
644 2019-01-04 19:43:47 A bit of a sidestep from “doesn’t pay any taxes.” Consider leading with the data rather than the hyperbole. 

Also, of course people benefiting from social programs don’t contribute to their funding as much. If they could afford to do that, they wouldn’t need those programs.

650 2019-01-04 19:42:28 With the legalization of Marijuana in so many parts of the world, trading Pot stocks are really the in thing. With triple-digit gains, a very real probability isn't it time you had a closer look at your portfolio or started with Pot Stocks
651 2019-01-04 19:42:11 It depends if u mean salary or shares. CEO’s used to have large amounts of stocks and gained wealth through the stock price increasing. Which is supposed to be linked to company performance but Enron proved it isn’t quite so simple
652 2019-01-04 19:41:38 Too bad about no more tax breaks to increase debt for the rich to buy back their stocks to pump up the market, huh?
653 2019-01-04 19:41:27 The wild swings in the stock market indicate just how unsure investors are in today’s world.  I am not sure if stocks are a safe investment anymore, especially with everything tied to a chaotic global economy.  #StockMarket #DowJones #TrumpShutdown #tariffs #JobsReport
654 2019-01-04 19:41:00 I don’t think so. Earnings will be worse,  and this Jobs number gives fed cover to hike if stocks stay up.

656 2019-01-04 19:39:42 So much Winning! Taxpayers footing the bill. Trump says tariff is easy to win. Where is it now? Passing the cost to the consumers that’s what!!

658 2019-01-04 19:39:18 Hoarding funds does not create jobs. We've seen with the recent and passed tax cuts and tax code that the wealthy and corporations will pocket funds and buy back stocks, if you want to help people going hungry, HELP THEM!

676 2019-01-04 19:33:50 FED# backed down today and finally acknowledged global slowdown. They used words 'patient' and 'flexible' in regards to future interest rate hikes. They should have stated this last month. Tremendous damage done to stocks in past quarter due to their blunder.

685 2019-01-04 19:30:20 You are a complete nutcase. You stock market tanked BEFORE the Dems took the House. Perhaps the reason for the decline in stocks is due to your crazy policy, tweets and the #TrumpShutdown

688 2019-01-04 19:28:48 The stock markets rose 33% under Obama during a similar period, that says nothing about the health of the economy. What Trump inherited was a bull market, and if you know anything about stocks, you would  not overheat a bull market by tax cuts. That's what's causing volatility.
689 2019-01-04 19:27:50 I can literally get a gun any time I want.   You honestly think bump stocks and background checks are vital. You definitely do not belong on Twitter. “Oooo look at all these words I’ve picked up from other people” get fucked pig.

692 2019-01-04 19:26:06 Powell today became what i feared he might become. Fed can not save the economy using the "tools" mentioned in the fed freak show today.

707 2019-01-04 19:22:43 Besides the drying up of easy money - stocks are not just about the US economy, but are now more about the world economy. Unfortunately almost everywhere else the economic data is bad (for example Apple fell because the Chinese didn’t buy their products at the same rate).

-GM closing plants
-Harley is making bikes overseas
-Stocks had their worst year in a decade
-Farmers needed a $12B bailout
-Fed deficits are SKYROCKETING

Enough with the bullshit, you inherited a strong economy and are making it worse.

776 2019-01-04 19:01:04 I spent a lot of time on here opining on the theory that if equities bottomed without triggering the Fed put that stocks and the USD would rally in tandem.  Obviously that changed today and I will need to change along with it. Nothing to be gained by digging your heels in.

801 2019-01-04 18:52:15 WRT the Fed, even if Powell doesn't raise rates, the damage to the credit bubble is already done, IMHO. It's going pop; stocks are therefore heading lower over the next 12 months.

806 2019-01-04 18:50:09 Are you really so spiteful that you’d pass up marginal income *which helps you and your family* (and, if you’d like, the charities of your choice!) because you’d go, “ultimately I get more psychic benefit from knowing I’m NOT funding food stamps” (or whatever you object to)?

857 2019-01-04 18:35:29 Yes, and in a very negative way. Most of the gun people I know don't care about bump stocks or think that they are kind of dumb.
But the way this ban was executed was quite alarming. It also seems like an invitation to be a slippery slope. The NRA should have been all over that.

869 2019-01-04 18:31:48 Powell expressed he's ready to play ball, be flexible. This crash started in December when Powell gave the impression not willing to play ball much. This is trend changing material. Want to still short stocks? Fine, just wait until market close at least.
870 2019-01-04 18:31:30 So the counter argument is: he did it too. & he’s a bad orange man for doing things the last guy did.

But remember kids, this is just day 2.  The hate, vulgarity & outlandish conduct is just really going to shift gears.

878 2019-01-04 18:28:47 Well...the new tax cut came into effect in 2018...so no one has seen their return as of yet...stocks are always up and down...but the market is ahead of where it was in 2016...so they must not be making good investments? But go on, your thinking has amused me!
879 2019-01-04 18:28:32 I guess this is awesome news if you're among the 10% of the country that holds 84% of the stocks. Otherwise, it's still just right wing capitalists doing right wing capitalist shit at the expense of the working poor. But celebrate that, Matty. Fucking hack.

889 2019-01-04 18:25:08 Honest question:  The fed has to have your back on pumping stock prices.  Because 9x% of stocks don't have a dividend, why the heck would buy them, unless, every year your dollar goes down, to inflate the stock price?
890 2019-01-04 18:25:04 This is true but its an obvious fact. Are you saying you'd advocate a higher capital gains tax on blue chips for example vs emerging market or potential high cap low volume stocks and options?

896 2019-01-04 18:21:50 Mek sure you investing inno. wether stocks/land/venture
897 2019-01-04 18:21:37 Invest in a wide net of low risk stocks. I'm not very good with money, so it would be safer if I dont have immediate access to it >~>

912 2019-01-04 18:19:05 It was about forty years ago I learned about it, which places it on or before the 1970s.  Most likely before, when US Army Chemical Corps had more latitude and fresher stocks of sarin (contamination of the agent made it less effective and hardert to store as time went on).
913 2019-01-04 18:18:36 They need to prop up their stocks in
914 2019-01-04 18:18:34 Nope.  Basically more of the same from them.  They aren't, and haven't been zealous enough on defending rights beyond hunting/sporting.  Bump stocks are dumb toys, but that doesn't give the federal government constitutional authority to ban them.  Congress, maybe.
915 2019-01-04 18:18:29 Cue sad trombone. Only 12 stocks in S&P 500 lower right now. Macy's. Advance Auto Parts. O'Reilly Automotive. Autozone. Newmont Mining. Cabot Oil & Gas. Gap. Public Storage.

916 2019-01-04 18:18:14 CNBC then and now ,the sky is falling worst December since 1929, Now great jobs numbers,stocks up big! You talked people out of the market causing them to miss this 1000 point + upswing
917 2019-01-04 18:17:55 if he doesn't invest in stocks, drop him.
918 2019-01-04 18:17:34 The US economy remains strong // Stocks tumble because one company revised its revenue projections. Something does not compute.
919 2019-01-04 18:17:19 I've never heard of bump stocks before conservatives started saying the Demmunists were trying to take them away. The phrase basically just serves as a dogwhistle now
920 2019-01-04 18:17:14 I was close to losing Richter player but manage to win

I had 1 Stock while he had 3 stocks

Man my Pichu is good
921 2019-01-04 18:17:10 I dont like mainstream stocks. But tesla maybe.
922 2019-01-04 18:17:04 Good luck to all. I am all in on Uranium mining stocks and 2% yielding cash. Only trading ups and downs in the market to scratch the itch.
923 2019-01-04 18:17:01 I guess its just not my style for forex. For stocks, yes.
924 2019-01-04 18:16:21 @kerryfoodgroup I haven’t been able to find go go cheese spread in any major supermarket for the last month or so. Any idea who stocks it?
925 2019-01-04 18:15:28 How about YES. That money is much more well spent trying to combat climate change or pumped into the economy, rather than sitting in stocks and bonds for the next 50 years just to passed down to their kids to sit in stocks and bonds for another 50 years!
926 2019-01-04 18:15:28 Stocks and deficit are doing great too, morons.
927 2019-01-04 18:15:24 Sweet! Do it 
928 2019-01-04 18:15:10 On Fox Biz News today @ 2:15. Tune in! Stocks melting up on strong jobs report and market-friendly comments this morning from present and past Fed Chairs. Enough to cure the correction? Maybe not but definite green shoots.
929 2019-01-04 18:15:01 Bump stocks were never even heard of much if at all till a crazy man decided to use one and the media jumped all over it. Fake news comes to mind.
930 2019-01-04 18:15:00 In 2020 I will vote for the opponent of any candidate for President, VP, House or Senate who refuses to divest stocks, hotels and other financial conflicts of interest.  That includes you @realDonaldTrump

933 2019-01-04 18:13:14 “If we’re below 23,300 we want to be short the Dow, net short of stocks in general”

“If we’re below 2530 [SPX] we want to be short or in heavy cash positions”
934 2019-01-04 18:13:04 Wow wow look what President Trump and gop stocks up Dow over 700 points  from a strong jobs report way to go gop stand your ground MAG good job people
935 2019-01-04 18:12:23 Stay focused.  International stocks are far more advanced in the drawdown than US.
936 2019-01-04 18:11:46 I managed to get two stocks, I'm happy

945 2019-01-04 18:10:07 Where are all the folks who were lionizing Powell for championing normalization last month? Is his martyrdom revoked for sounding like a patsy and goosing stocks this morning?

950 2019-01-04 18:09:17 FBN yesterday ; DOW down 640 pts tanking on poor Manufacturing numbers and economy slowing down..everything is awful

951 2019-01-04 18:09:05 this gap and go rally in stocks on an nfp day reminds me of the march 2018 nfp rally
952 2019-01-04 18:08:44 I agree that the tariffs have a negative impact on the stocks which will hopefully go away once there is a new trade deal with China and the EU. I also have to again say that the democrats are also part of the slide of the stock market
953 2019-01-04 18:08:29 January is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks.

963 2019-01-04 18:04:19 Time to sell the stocks.
964 2019-01-04 18:03:51 It’s great to see the market bouncing back a bit today, but to keep things in perspective, NASDAQ was over 8,000 back in early Oct, 2018, and it’s 6,736 after today’s ~4% gain. #markets #stocks
965 2019-01-04 18:03:50 Most I use my local ASB bank one 3% per transaction. I struggle to get American stocks cheap thou as I have to buy through physical people, hence you buy and hold for a long time

976 2019-01-04 18:01:15 Just purchasing stocks on sale.  The market is apolitical. It just can't withstand economic shocks as a result of Trump's  political ineptitude.

Penny stocks or tokens require a thorough DD questionnaire before you even begin the dance.

1022 2019-01-04 17:47:05 Basically DX has pool of stocks that can be traded 24 hrs extremely transparently on $ETH but for redemption that is reliant on DX. Guess #ETH relieves them of some account management & gives users more control.
1023 2019-01-04 17:47:04 On the plus side, Boeing stocks are up nicely. 
1024 2019-01-04 17:47:00 No. My view hasn't changed of the NRA. Their views seem exaggerated enough without being advocates of bump stocks.

1026 2019-01-04 17:46:46 I don't like Options, it's as much guessing as shorting. I prefer stocks. If your options expire then you're simply out that money, but if my stock goes down chances are it will come back up.

1033 2019-01-04 17:45:22 If too many companies scale down their stocks, like what happened, stocks would become more volatile, and a massive crash is more likely to happen, especially with this crazy market manipulation tarriff scheme. Dow tumbled and ruined Christmas for many.
1034 2019-01-04 17:44:41 Anybody who does 2 stock and anything less than 6 minutes, or 3 stock 3 minutes or less is getting blocked. I don't like 3 stocks 6 minutes, but that's at least doable. Some of these online players thinking they can just get their wins through timeouts. 
1035 2019-01-04 17:44:24 Now do the day after they won the house, or the day after the 16 election. With stocks that matter.

1048 2019-01-04 17:42:47 Wondering why your defense & contractor stocks are tumbling? Thank Donald!

Even tho furloughed feds miss mortgage payments & dig into retirement funds in a gov't shutdown, they eventually get paid by congressional acts after shutdowns. But hundreds of 1000's of contractors don't

So u have to go to the business to find if its good or not

1066 2019-01-04 17:34:15 lucas has to be a top tier because i’m at 2mil gsp playing against people who are way better than me and still consistently winning with 2 stocks
1067 2019-01-04 17:34:13 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $GPS, $AAP, $M, $COG, and $AZO.
1068 2019-01-04 17:34:01 If someone chooses to run for public office, they should know it’s not to ILLEGALLY ENRICH themselves by having inside knowledge to buy & sell stocks! They should be like everyone else in America & live on their paychecks PERIOD! You want to be rich, work in corporate world!!!
1069 2019-01-04 17:34:00 ended war on coal? ISIS 90% destroyed? stocks up $7Trillion was last January - how the damage since then, plus the deficit? you still expect anyone to take you seriously? 
1070 2019-01-04 17:33:35 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $MAT, $AMD, $NFLX, $VAR, and $FCX.
1071 2019-01-04 17:33:12 Stocks, real estate and private business holdings. All of which don’t get taxed!  Taxing income will NEVER get to the amounts AOC would need to pull this off. Even if this were to be something the gov wanted to take on they couldn’t ever pay for it. Maybe 50 years & it’s doable!
1072 2019-01-04 17:33:08 Chill, ride the wave and continue to buy stocks at a discount. With a long perspective and choosing companies that will be here in 5-10 years we should do well :)

Pretty sure boa did the same at one point
1077 2019-01-04 17:31:57 Funny... Just a day, or so ago they warned of missed earnings, so people want to buy into those stocks now?
1078 2019-01-04 17:31:02 lol Have you seen the Jobs report for Dec. Do you even think before you post. Oh yeah and the stock market is up 710 points today. If you are going to blame im him when its down you have to give credit when it is up. Here is a secret Stocks go up and down all the time forever !
1079 2019-01-04 17:30:33 Constructive behavior in the #stocks on my #watchlist. But I am missing volume here. Don’t be in a hurry! You don’t want to be the first at the party 
1080 2019-01-04 17:30:31 Stocks are green :-)
1081 2019-01-04 17:30:21 So much winning. From the yesterday:

BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.

1085 2019-01-04 17:29:36 Good point. They rode several bull markets up but they'll sell into a bear market. And the companies whose stocks they own don't generate enough dividend yield to create a significant income.

Passive income getting hard to come by. I'm worried too.
1086 2019-01-04 17:29:18 Now just shut up for the rest of the week and let the stocks pick up steam. Don't ruin it with petty stupid tweets.
1087 2019-01-04 17:28:08 Sitting and watching stocks trade daily for months and months over different changing market conditions is how you learn to recognize the best choice of action

1096 2019-01-04 17:26:45 I know what a difference paper choice makes, but I’m still always blown away when I get physical samples of the same thing on different paper stocks. I am *very* excited about the Silent Titans bonus book.
1097 2019-01-04 17:26:44 I don't know explain to my fellow Americans why ! Im sure it will be entertaining. When the prime is high Stocks will die. When the prime is low Stocks will grow. Or maybe you didn't learn that.
1098 2019-01-04 17:26:42 Michaels stocks acrylics, cottons, and blends. 100% wool, specific sheep or specialty fibers, or hand dyed will all crank that price.

Michaels 100% wool, such as it is, is prolly itchy and scratchy.
1099 2019-01-04 17:26:27 A few well discussed twitterati stocks hitting new 52 week lows today incl. 7DIG, FFI and W7L.  

In contrast new IPO AJ Bell (AJB) hitting new highs. Don’t hold any of these.
1100 2019-01-04 17:26:06 Why won’t Congress enact a law that requires the President, Vice President and Members of Congress to follow the same financial conflict of interest rule, 18 USC 208, that applies to just about every other federal employee?
Because they don’t want to have to sell their stocks.
1101 2019-01-04 17:25:53 When I come to power using #facetime without headphones on public transport will be banned and anyone found breaking the rule will be punished in the stocks with rotten food

1107 2019-01-04 17:24:02 To me, Powell revealed himself as a Wall Street shill today.  I think 3000 S&P before next blip down, then up to 4000.  It makes literally no sense, but finally realizing stocks are going to be supported at all cost.
1108 2019-01-04 17:23:30 It is all contrived to make it look bad for the Democrats.
Yes it will bounce back because it has to.
Rich people have to make money and then take it.
Somebody has to lose and it is usually someone with a small investment.

1110 2019-01-04 17:23:22 It’s more than fun. Y’know if he was actually put in the stocks, he could be pelted with rotting vegetables ALL DAY. No eggs, of course, ‘cause that wouldn’t be vegan.
1111 2019-01-04 17:23:16 it's always a word game as we know. but he also said (looking at Yellen) "reducing balance sheet supposed to be like watching paint dry"

= auto pilot 

Since Oct "far from neutral" stocks plunged -20%, bonds rallied 75bp. 

he also said "listen carefully to the market"
1112 2019-01-04 17:23:09 Not so sure... his base doesn’t own stocks, and China can be a useful bogeyman to blame if / when the economy turns

1115 2019-01-04 17:22:41 One of the biggest problems I see w swing traders is that they think the news drives stocks & markets. That discounts the FACT that over 10,000 #hedge funds control over $3.3 Trillion & are putting that money to work every day moving stocks. It's what they r paid to do! #options
1116 2019-01-04 17:22:40 he’s coming to a place where more people than the national average are on long term medication, to tell them that talk of shortages is nothing to worry about. he should be in, at best, the stocks WHILE WE STILL HAVE TOMATOES TO CHUCK
1117 2019-01-04 17:22:38 Stocks giddy over Powell, Dow +nearly 700 points.
1118 2019-01-04 17:22:17 That's okay Frank! Hope you had a good rest, my the stocks stay in the Green today!
1119 2019-01-04 17:22:07 looking at the year charts on the Nasdaq, Dow and S&P500, we are near crossing above the 20 day, a minor win, if it comes in the next week.  Many stocks still below their 20 day
1120 2019-01-04 17:22:02 IMO more likely that we re-test lower BB/low $25's before next move up. Will look to add to position in this region. Fully expecting earnings to show phenomenal sales for all legal weed stocks. Demand up here is unprecedented.
1121 2019-01-04 17:21:49 Stocks futures regain any modest losses that were given up soon after the jobs data.

1123 2019-01-04 17:21:14 I just got back to Edinburgh from Kerala. I have anecdotal evidence that the fishing communities where I was are under quite a bit of stress because fishing stocks are down. I suspect its the same story up and down kerala. Its also reflected in the increased prices too.
1124 2019-01-04 17:20:54 and you still think stocks are lower now vs Obama? you need help...and a calculator

1126 2019-01-04 17:20:32 @sainsburys which store nearest to Newport, South Wales stocks the Gardein range?
1127 2019-01-04 17:20:26 Agreed. At least they have to recuse under the Court’s rules (Congress has no such rule) but it would be better if they sold the stocks.
1128 2019-01-04 17:20:24 Someone donate money to me for stocks please
1129 2019-01-04 17:20:23 Compared to the world of disaster capitalists. They make money in markets by gambling in futures and stocks. They are the money men behind Brexit and this is the future if we let them. When it comes to Brexit why does the “party of business” want it so badly?
1130 2019-01-04 17:20:22 Bonne nouvelle ça ! Bon courage à vous ! Au niveau des stocks, j'espère que ça va le faire et que je pourrais commander dès que le site revient dans un orbite proche 
1131 2019-01-04 17:20:12 STOCKS - PERFECT DAY:  China is back at trade talk, government reported extremely strong jobs report, and Federal Reserve said they'll be nice.  Market is up over 600 points.   I took a small short position in market and will sell more stocks if market gets to 24,000.

1133 2019-01-04 17:20:07 Demand number is likely wrong. Gasoline demand was higher on ethanol blending. A better weekly proxy.

Exports could be lower, due to decade high tanker rates. PADD1 stocks were low, more product was likely sent there or stayed in PADD3.

Weeks ahead should show change.

Is #POWELL a #PATRIOT like that of #GREENSPAN and his "IRRATIONAL exuberance" comments who jacked up interest rates and KILLED #STOCKS?? The #FED a PATRIOT??
1139 2019-01-04 17:18:32 And it looks like the stock markets LOVE that the Dems have taken over the House--stocks way up this morning.

The numbers are only "final" until changed again after nobody cares. 
All that being said, I don't mind quarterly stocks updates. Gives us a measurement, albeit not entirely accurate.

1149 2019-01-04 17:14:24 The only other time I shorted stocks was satellite radio stocks 12 years ago.  I only short if I'm convinced they have to go BK.  Tesla is a strange beast with 9 lives.
1150 2019-01-04 17:14:19 Yes. Plenty of ppl approached abt exposure to gun stocks. Fr that pt on we started to screen for other vices and the client response has been tremendous.

1154 2019-01-04 17:13:17 my aunt worked for UPS for years and apparently there are stocks in my name and as soon as they get to be worth over $100 again she's gonna help me sell them so i can just get free money basically :)))
1155 2019-01-04 17:13:04 It's a new year, but our resolutions haven't changed. In 2018, bump stocks were banned. In 2019, we will keep fighting for universal background checks and so much more. Join us as we continue to demand change.
1156 2019-01-04 17:12:51 I’m not happy but I am not unhappy! What the heck is that? It’s not that I don’t care; I just shifted my focus away from my heart because to have that is to have all of me! Now I focus on trading stocks! I will revisit the heart one day or never!
1157 2019-01-04 17:12:27 EVERY other tech stock should "warn" about slowing and watch stocks rocket even higher!!!

1159 2019-01-04 17:12:05 $SPY Some will continue to 2nd guess every move until stocks/markets are considerably higher.  Don't let this be you. Buy low, sell high.
1160 2019-01-04 17:11:21 Like when my father was investing in, say, 1974, the stocks weren't that attractive since returns hadn't really outperformed "safer" instruments like CDs for 50 years or more. Seems valuation now is driven in part by a perception that didn't exist prior to 1980.

Cool man!
1162 2019-01-04 17:11:00 The Market was warned just a day ago that earnings will miss in 2019

Next day... "Hey, time to buy stocks again!"


1163 2019-01-04 17:10:45 Why is the Market up (specifically growth stocks) when the Fed said 2019 Growth slowing and 2020 will be even slower? Good luck buying into this, they told you things are slowing and at best they will slowly adjust. $VUG $SPY $QQQ
1164 2019-01-04 17:10:32 Anyone looking to get into trading stocks? I've been looking at it for awhile and this app Robinhood has been pretty cool so far. If you want to check it out, let me send you a link and when you make an account, we both get a free stock, possibly Apple, Twitter, Microsoft.
1165 2019-01-04 17:10:31 I called my friend last night, he can document it, and I told him things are looking good for stocks. He had a hard time believing it after yesterday's decline. I told him the Fed can't raise rates any time soon because of the yield on treasury bonds. What did the Fed say today?

1172 2019-01-04 17:08:23 My stocks are down dude don't spread lies I'm worried about my financial situation
1173 2019-01-04 17:07:56 I mean, just guessing, but as smaller indexes with less total stocks a big hit to a single massive stock affects them more and the rally based on jobs that goes mostly to smaller firms doesn't buoy as much?
1174 2019-01-04 17:07:35 To me this is a bit more than disagree when after the Vegas shooting La Pierre was on a Sunday show saying “the ATF needs to look at this (bumpfire stocks) and do it’s job”...that’s not disagreement but capitulation
1175 2019-01-04 17:06:59 all economic models have their limitations and capitalist theory assumes a balanced fair market- it holds less true when income disparities are so polarized like they are today.  95% of stocks are held by the top 15% of the population- this is not free market it's aristocracy.
1176 2019-01-04 17:06:57 jungkook stocks sugarcanes and eat them like a panda and this is so RELATABLE to me honestly
1177 2019-01-04 17:06:42 Hundreds of thousands of American workers still don’t know when their next paycheck will come. The fundamentals of the stock market are faltering after stocks posted their worst year in a decade. #JobsReport
1178 2019-01-04 17:05:51 Government reported extremely strong job report for December. Trade talks with China have resumed.  Trump said to buy stocks.  So market is up huge.  I'm selling the rally, taking a small short position..Foreign companies still avoiding doing business with USA . & BUDGET DEFICIT.

1180 2019-01-04 17:05:35 Stocks surge as markets start to realize the breadth and depth of Trump economic boom.  MAGA!

1185 2019-01-04 17:04:30 The Puritans sure objected to that but the president paying off mistresses would have to wear the scarlet letter "A" and be put in stocks in the town square.  Too bad the good old days are gone.
1186 2019-01-04 17:04:14 I agree. Great point. However..... name me one republican or political figure who has criticized the Trump administration for banning bump stocks.

1193 2019-01-04 17:02:30 Any friends who buy penny stocks?
1194 2019-01-04 17:01:45 SPY briefly peaks above 251 resistance before now trading at 251.  'January effect' stocks mentioned in webinars catching bids led by ROKU up 10%, NFLX also catching major bid (high rel strength on Thursday).  If SPY stays near 251 into afternoon, then "possible" panic to upside.
1195 2019-01-04 17:01:44 Yup been saying that since the beginning. It doesn’t add up and it was way before this smoke and mirrors game currently being played. I was called a basher but as the otc world shows. Truth is not appreciated
1196 2019-01-04 17:01:36 So your picking a point in time . Reagan was a great president . Carter sold the Panama . I'm asking My Fellow Americans to buy stocks now and pay attention to the prime. Not making an argument why dems are dumb
1197 2019-01-04 17:01:33 yeah it is! I'm thinking of doing some pictures on semi thick paper, using both ink and copics. Bnha is definitely on my list of what to draw. I will do some and then see if anyone wants to buy them. Also want to sell them on bigcartel, but I need to pay to limit stocks on items
1198 2019-01-04 17:01:04 Stocks Too High, I would!
1199 2019-01-04 17:01:00 #USDA suspends release of key reports (crop production, stocks, winter #wheat seedings) scheduled for next Friday (Jan. 11). No new release date set yet. #GovtShutdown
1200 2019-01-04 17:00:50 Notice that the stock market doesn't care at all about the (limited) gov't shutdown?  Stocks have the view it is all political theater nonsense.  Who doesn't hate Congress?  May be best that some of the gov't stays shut down.
1201 2019-01-04 17:00:37 Cause there is NO such thing as price manipulation in stocks

1207 2019-01-04 17:00:12 US | EIA Crude Oil Stocks Change  for december: 7000.0 (Cons: -3086000.0, Prev: -46000.0)
1208 2019-01-04 17:00:08 There is still time to buy energy stocks. But... I can’t tell you when or if the market will crash again
1209 2019-01-04 17:00:08 It used to be financed by foreigners buying USTs...that has ceased.  Now that domestic private sector must finance it, domestic sector doesn't have the balance sheet to finance it w/o selling stocks...but if stocks don't rise, US economy falls = problem.
1210 2019-01-04 17:00:02 US | EIA Gasoline Stocks Change  for december: 6890000.0 (Cons: 1967000.0, Prev: 3003000.0)

1214 2019-01-04 16:59:35 RT Nicholas_Merten: jstattsiv No, I absolutely think those things built a bubble, and US stocks are going lower in 2019. I talk about this on my channel all the time. But QE is over and rates are nearing 3% this year. Seeing this kind of growth in this environment is extreme…
1215 2019-01-04 16:59:33 Easy.  Gingrich tried to with clinton.

At least with Bill, the economy was in a surplus by the time he was done.  Stocks didn't fall like they are doing under your watch, and housing was booming.  He also left after two terms on a high note.  You won't get two.
1216 2019-01-04 16:59:28 Tech stocks are over rated, literally.
1217 2019-01-04 16:59:11 Sunny will be the first to tell you him and I do not get along lulz. But what I will say is he actually gained some respect by speaking his truth as he sees it. You don’t like it ignore it but as punisher stated. Something is fishy and I commend sunny for going against the herd
1218 2019-01-04 16:58:51 Did you notice that the day you left the U.S. to showboat in Iraq that stocks gained over 1000 points? When you returned, it has been on a free fall. Leave the country and don't come back. Take your family with you. #TrumpResign
1219 2019-01-04 16:58:41 Everybody, just stay diversified. Stocks, bonds, commodities. You will be fine in the long run.
1220 2019-01-04 16:58:37 When Trump elected in 2016 stocks shot up just a month after elections & continued, until the dems won the house.  There are no coincidences.
1221 2019-01-04 16:58:32 SHORT $RECN at $15.95.  #stocks #finance #DOW #nasdaq #money
1222 2019-01-04 16:57:59 Just a day, or so ago they warned of missed earnings, so people want to buy into those stocks now?
1223 2019-01-04 16:57:41 can we stop including the stock market though. Totally agree with the rest but when GM lays off thousands, stocks go up. If there is regulatory progress, stocks go down. Not sure the stock market should be on this list, given it’s a pretty distorted metric.
1224 2019-01-04 16:57:33 Stocks looking extra nice today! What a day it has been. Hoping it’s the beginning of the Bull Run! 
1225 2019-01-04 16:57:29 A reminder from few days ago: 

Under Trump and thank to him, "US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent." (The Associated Press)
1226 2019-01-04 16:57:28 Just a day, or so ago they warned of missed earnings, so people want to buy into those stocks now? 
1227 2019-01-04 16:57:25 The point is look at how this bump stock ban came to light, he had an unelected unaccountable individual just add a few sentences to an existing law and poof...bump stocks are illegal, that’s a very dangerous precedent
1228 2019-01-04 16:57:10 - Worst stock market since Great Recession
- Worst Dec. for stocks since Great Depression
- 800K fed workers (>200K Vets) with no pay
- Record China trade deficit
- Nearly $1T budget deficit
- Nat’l debt $22T
- Life expectancy dropped
- 40K gun deaths

Winning?

@realDonaldTrump
1229 2019-01-04 16:56:51 You know what? You are your own worst enemy. You've done two (ONLY two!) good things since you were elected - banned bump stocks and gotten a prison reform bill passed. But you do so many batsh*t crazy things every day those things get completely lost. #Steponyourowncrank
1230 2019-01-04 16:56:33 Very true! Days like today are Especially encouraging for stocks like $KALY.V $KALTF that are having high volume upward momentum days

1233 2019-01-04 16:55:22 The stocks rallied on #Powell staying independent.
1234 2019-01-04 16:54:42 Because their jobs rely directly or indirectly on selling stocks. If they were all so smart, they wouldn’t need to work!

1238 2019-01-04 16:54:08 .@petenajarian why is it that the @HalftimeReport has real traders like you, that trade, but @CNBCFastMoney show at 5 pm et has a bunch of folks that just talk about stocks, with no disclosures, thus zero skin in the game? I bet the rating suck when you're not on the evening show
1239 2019-01-04 16:53:59 thing is you never know if this stock will keep running ... sometimes they keep running so it is 50/50 coulg do up or down. So that is part of the trading stocks
1240 2019-01-04 16:53:54 It’s important to note that when the Fed talks of inflation they’re talking abouta a 70s style run on the dollar. And when they talk of asset bubbles they’re talking about stocks in ‘99 or housing in ‘06.

The great tax burden they put on the middle class and the working poor. The tax cut for wealthy did not help every day people! 
They bought back stocks and ran with the money! Greed over humanity!
1275 2019-01-04 16:42:40 Super duper high marginal rates mainly hit upper middle class, truly obscenely rich masters of the universe don't get touched.

Also, wealth is much easier to identify than income -- stocks, bonds, bank accounts, buildings, private corporations -- to confiscate from tax cheats.
1276 2019-01-04 16:42:24 Look at FAANG stocks. They represent a huge and highly undiversified chunk of the stock market. Not good.
1277 2019-01-04 16:42:21 Fed does little durning President Obama's term keep rates low President Trump elected economy , confidence &stock market sore.Democrats win house in November Fed keeps raising rates stocks & confidence sink, huh Americans should ask Chairman Powell to resign he is a swamp dweller
1278 2019-01-04 16:42:15 Allow me to translate:
CB's should ~always~ print money, and buy stocks/bonds...
Repeat, until everyone's RICH!!!

That's Ross's entire investment strategy, folks...
Proceed with caution...

1311 2019-01-04 16:35:51 The reason why Apple Stocks got down.
1312 2019-01-04 16:35:29 They're already paying their fair share of 35%, which amounts to millions in taxes. They even get taxed on the money they invest in stocks or housing. Make companies pay their fair share, who bring in billions and pay 0% or even get tax returns.
1313 2019-01-04 16:35:28 Assault rifles can be altered by putting bump stocks for instance. Federal/State Law refers to semi/auto rifles/pistols/shotguns that accept detachable magazines. Bush banned semi/auto rifle imports in 1989. Talk to Brian K.

1320 2019-01-04 16:32:58 Unemployment started dropping years ago. Trump had some hand it, but not as much as people think. Depends where your funds are in your retirement fun. If it’s in an account that accrues interest, yes, it will do well because the feds just raised the rates. Not so good for stocks.
1321 2019-01-04 16:32:36 Where do you trade stocks @PeterLBrandt ?
1322 2019-01-04 16:32:16 They want different results but don't seem to be able to change their manipulative ways Luke. I am watching oil fade which tells me this rally is probably not real and I would expect stocks to sniff that out as well. Again until gold is set free nothing changes.
1323 2019-01-04 16:32:10 Woohoo. You got bump stocks banned. Something found at 1 crime scene. Don't even know if he used it. But you got it banned. Amazing!!!!
1324 2019-01-04 16:32:02 of all stocks in the pooper today $DECK is -3.40
1325 2019-01-04 16:32:02 Isn’t it from them freezing apple stock the other day and said that the Q1 numbers were dropping? I don’t know much about stocks, but that caught my eye the other day
1326 2019-01-04 16:31:40 nothing quite as exhilarating as buying/selling stocks & following the stock market
1327 2019-01-04 16:31:28 $RGBP I agree it is just a matter of time My DD on companies I select is never for a quick $$$ buck it is for big $$$. $BCDA $TEAR $CELZ $TSOI $CBBT $VRUS $CTIC $WLL Do your DD and always stay away from STOP & YEILD SIGNS.

1328 2019-01-04 16:30:29 Might give some back later in the day but a close above 2500 for the $SPX would be good for next week. Historically the first couple of weeks in Jan are good for stocks. Last two weeks are poor, historically.
1329 2019-01-04 16:30:23 Insane move in growth stocks w/ most up 5%+ and many up 7% or more
1330 2019-01-04 16:30:18 *She can’t help but to chuckle softly as she hugs her* It’s not like I had a choice but I don’t plan on it. *She stocks her tongue out at Daiki, grinning softly*
1331 2019-01-04 16:29:46 Gonna be a lot of mad folks over this. People are getting those refund anticipation loans, which I tell people all the time to leave alone. 

If you have no property (house, land), no stocks/investments and only have W2s/1099s, you can do your own taxes in under two hours.
1332 2019-01-04 16:29:23 #Powell seemed to disconnect stocks from the economy.  Psychological wealth effect drives consumption.  Powell was creating a recession.  Glad he wised up.
1333 2019-01-04 16:29:07 Career politicians don’t give a damn shit to how stocks perform.
1334 2019-01-04 16:28:11 Stock Market is down because:
1. Most of the stocks were inflated by buy backs, not a rise in market share.
2. Real wages haven't gone up.
3. There are multiple ongoing trade wars.
4. There are big layoffs coming.

Having worked for the NYSE for 13.5 years..you sort of see trends
1335 2019-01-04 16:28:07 *Bump stocks*
1336 2019-01-04 16:28:00 But it works well for their wealthy donors. They LOVE debt! After all, lending the government money & collecting interest, or dividends on bank stocks, is a far better deal for them than paying taxes. Bonus if they can make more people desperate enough to work for a pittance.
1337 2019-01-04 16:27:39 Summary of Powell's interview:  You may safely resume accumulating more debt and buying stocks on margin.   

#Fed #FederalReserve
1338 2019-01-04 16:27:21 Not much higher for now - maybe 2% higher. We are already up 7% from the Christmas lows. Multiples are still too high & earnings growth will be modest. My view is that growth holds up but stocks don’t see a ton of upside in 2019

1340 2019-01-04 16:26:23 Come back, come back. Stocks go down everytime you leave your desk. Why?

1342 2019-01-04 16:26:06 Buying stocks based on job numbers is like buying a horse because you like the smell of his poop.

1345 2019-01-04 16:25:24 Jumping in uninvited. Education is a right, in the same way food is a right. Not everyone needs a t-bone....which is why the driving issue is what jobs we require degrees for. The job market is becoming a store that only stocks t-bones / BS degrees in admin jobs.
1346 2019-01-04 16:25:22 Powell said FED will be patient with rate hikes, watch for data, he did not say he is done with hikes or he will cut.  The market is pricing in no hikes or even cut in '19. With today's wage data, there are hikes coming in 19, even if few - that's not good news for stocks
1347 2019-01-04 16:24:55 I'm taking a domestic bias as a European Investor, more exposed to european stocks. In this perspective, moving from a style to another, using factors tilt, and sectors rotation inside the benchmark can help you improve your return.
1348 2019-01-04 16:24:34 I'm not sure you understand how Capitalism works... As a CEO, if you tell me that after 10 mill, everything is taxes 70%, I'll just cap my salary at 10, and take bonuses, stocks, or just be happy at 10. Just to not give you that 70%. Accounts will attest to this. It happens.

1351 2019-01-04 16:24:08 CDFI MoneyMind tip for Jan 4: on an average day, a moderately well diversified stock portfolio will EARN you 1% or more on your investment. Credit cards CHARGE you an average of 19% interest. Therefore it’s better to buy stocks than pay your credit card balances off. #finance
1352 2019-01-04 16:23:37 Well unless either happens, we can't judge. Tech is available for improvements & to increase supply of fruit/veg stocks. Though currently there is enough anyway, it's just not well distributed. 
In terms of crop farmers suffering, well part of the blame is with supermarkets

1354 2019-01-04 16:23:24 @timothysykes  I appreciate your personal response to my questions in the past. I am still trying to get to the point I could afford your training. So buying your book would give me all the info I need to be successful at trading penny stocks?
1355 2019-01-04 16:23:24 You may be getting an extra $20 a paycheck but the rich got millions. Corporations used their extra income to buy back stocks which doesn’t benefit you in any way. So don’t let $20 blind you to who really won here. We could really use those tax dollars right now but they’re gone
1356 2019-01-04 16:23:20 Stocks are like sushi. You don’t want a bargain.
1357 2019-01-04 16:23:16 on big board stocks, they help, sure.  not sure if it is equally beneficial on the OTC.  I have seen many OTC stocks R/S, then fall to oblivion soon after the split.  $AITX $OCSY - to name a few in recent memory.
1358 2019-01-04 16:22:48 Broke people buy iPhones. Rich people buy extremely cheap chinko phones and shares/stocks from Apple 
1359 2019-01-04 16:22:29 hyg /jnk lead stocks so based on their moves today spx will probably hit 2600 level and possibly backtest back test 50 day MA.

m. mangers ding what they want to buy and rotate the spx profits from today into those assets. spx almost up 3% and gdxj down less than 0.5%
1360 2019-01-04 16:21:49 When the prime is high Stocks will die and when the prime is low Stocks will grow. With that said it's easy to see how wealth is controlled and built
1361 2019-01-04 16:21:49 I got stocks with limited or Victoria secret fact ...

1367 2019-01-04 16:21:07 I keep trying to tell you that the Fed is not interested in propping up stocks. If they were, they wouldn’t have raised rates 9 times already and wouldn’t be shrinking the B/S by $50B per month. They may play dumb, but they’re well aware of what they’re doing.
1368 2019-01-04 16:21:05 After this morning we can now get back to picking stocks instead of trying to stay alive.  We’ll let the paint dry and then start buying some equities - can lay loose on the oex puts for now.  This was a great morning whatever the market does the rest of the day.  $spy

1380 2019-01-05 23:44:07 So you are against the stock market now? I just bought 1000 shares of a cannabis company. at 1.18. it's already up. Is there something wrong with what I did? Do you own any stocks, funds? Something wrong with that too These moralists are quite a fun crowd.
1381 2019-01-05 23:42:28 stocks that about to have MACD crossovers: $ISM and $IRC still needed to break those resistances
1382 2019-01-05 23:41:29 Yeah, but not for the next couple of elections.  Women are overwhelmingly Democrats.  Trump had a good day yesterday with economic numbers up and stocks coming back.  But 2020 depends on how smart Dems are. With E. Warren that is a bad choice.
1383 2019-01-05 23:39:38 Corp awash in cash not raising wages but buying back stocks,now asset bubble. Tax break gave them more $ for more buybacks. Not as much coming back as he says. Look at GM,majority of GM vehicles sold in China not here & made in China. We're headed for hard times I fear.

1386 2019-01-05 23:36:40 Reduced to character slurs? Typical. But to ask...down from what? Sotero era stock levels? If so you better have a strong chat with your fund manager. no doubt he's investing your 401K in Climate change stocks.

1397 2019-01-05 23:44:07 So you are against the stock market now? I just bought 1000 shares of a cannabis company. at 1.18. it's already up. Is there something wrong with what I did? Do you own any stocks, funds? Something wrong with that too These moralists are quite a fun crowd.
1398 2019-01-05 23:42:28 stocks that about to have MACD crossovers: $ISM and $IRC still needed to break those resistances
1399 2019-01-05 23:41:29 Yeah, but not for the next couple of elections.  Women are overwhelmingly Democrats.  Trump had a good day yesterday with economic numbers up and stocks coming back.  But 2020 depends on how smart Dems are. With E. Warren that is a bad choice.
1400 2019-01-05 23:39:38 Corp awash in cash not raising wages but buying back stocks,now asset bubble. Tax break gave them more $ for more buybacks. Not as much coming back as he says. Look at GM,majority of GM vehicles sold in China not here & made in China. We're headed for hard times I fear.
1401 2019-01-05 23:38:00 Interesting.. But the index was very different until it became the an index of 500 stocks
1402 2019-01-05 23:37:14 I will recomment on this tweet in a year or two when bitcoin is well over $25,000, stocks are 50%+ off, and the whole economy is a recession, if not a depression.  For an advisory firm, you are definately abysmal.
1403 2019-01-05 23:36:40 Reduced to character slurs? Typical. But to ask...down from what? Sotero era stock levels? If so you better have a strong chat with your fund manager. no doubt he's investing your 401K in Climate change stocks.

1412 2019-01-05 23:26:34 Then you trade it ... But how does that differ from trading FANG stocks, which are not as susceptible to wild moves?

I like your 50/50 on a 12x. Have to take that bet every time no?

1417 2019-01-05 23:23:59 How do you find stocks like this. Is there a specific screener you run?
1418 2019-01-05 23:21:47 I wonder what their personal financial advisors are telling them. Stocks are going to tank if they even attempt it. They'll end up going broke.
1419 2019-01-05 23:20:19 I trawl the websites of Coke’s and Woolies to look for weekly specials then head to a place where two or more groceries exist eg Westfields, and go from one to the other picking up bargains. It’s like paying for stocks, you’d want to pay for the best possible prices :)
1420 2019-01-05 23:20:07 I feel ya but I'd rather use Diddy than Bayonetta at times I use one combo with bayo and feels like I sit there for 5 years and my stocks gone.
1421 2019-01-05 23:17:43 Sure they are. It's like how Mexico will be paying for the wall...
See how great the economy is doing? People now have more money because of the drug companies (look at how much their stocks have increased!). The "good economy" is actually paying the Rx cost not the consumer.

1430 2019-01-05 23:13:09 So you understand what owning stocks mean right?
1431 2019-01-05 23:12:22 Are you referring to personal investment or purchasing stocks or something? That's not investing in the company in the way you seem to be implying...
1432 2019-01-05 23:11:13 Go look at your stocks and define the day the market began to fall. Then look at the day before and tell me what event occurred to start it. Glad you brought this up because finance is my livelihood.
1433 2019-01-05 23:10:26 I’m not in favor of the tax, but those earnings that are taxed at 70% are also put into stocks. They don’t consume more
1434 2019-01-05 23:10:23 Finished figuring out how to rebalance our accounts (not simple w/ moving targets + 5 accts) and looking at stocks for my "fun money" acct. And now can't remember if took meds for headache 5 min ago or not...

1436 2019-01-05 23:08:02 How do you measure global GM.PMI? Is it just the JP index or do you individually take every countrys GM.PMI and char it individually? And what are you feelings of the ISM report lagging the market over the quarter? Would you be now looking at defensive stocks over growth?
1437 2019-01-05 23:07:14 I was doing a lot of Christmas shopping in #uranium #stocks too, Marcelo. As I see it, the reverse impact of $URA in a bull market will add extra torque to all names $URA holds, moving them far higher as they gain leverage from AUM growth of $URA as has happened in past. Cheers!

1446 2019-01-05 22:57:30 So SPX -5% (before divs) just like this year. And that's probably the optimistic view. If correct, another traders' market just like this year. Short the rips, cover/buy the dips. And pick your spots (specific stocks, sectors, etc.). Great alpha opportunities for the nimble.
1447 2019-01-05 22:56:01 As someone who works in financial services - I can tell you know that stocks and sharing are the BASIS of businesses therefore u are wrong and that is never going to happen

1452 2019-01-05 22:50:30 That’s not true. It creates investment AND buy backs.  You can’t have one without thee other. You can’t create a climate that allows for growth but not the ability to buy back stocks. It’s a talking point of the left but isn’t vested in situational reality.
1453 2019-01-05 22:50:18 Thanks Erick. There's no mention of thumbhole stocks in any Australian state firearms law or regulation as far as I am aware.

1486 2019-01-05 22:27:40 Yes, called inverse condemnation. Even if not negligent, they have to prove they were prudent, and liabilities are not always recoverable in rates. All CA utilities stocks have tanked in the last 12 mos for this reason
1487 2019-01-05 22:27:10 Optimal vegan diets should be tried both with and without DHA supplements in order to separate the effects of abnormally high intakes of DHA/fish/mercury etc. This is especially important since fish is expensive and only becoming more expensive as stocks are depleted.

1522 2019-01-05 21:59:25 Apart from this kind of greed and cruelty it's an appalling industry. Smaller fishes mined out of the seas to feed them. Fish stocks severely depleted. Deprives many marine-feeding birds of their food. No wonder they are declining.

1531 2019-01-05 21:52:14 And when you say "Americans", is that code for billionaires who buy their stocks back?  Or is it the rapists you support in the white house?  Because real citizens have had their money stolen and redistributed to those types, eh Scalise?

1536 2019-01-05 21:47:29 Stocks go up on growth and future results, not necessarily when unemployment goes down. If you paid attention yesterday the unemployment rate actually rose to 3.9% v. 3.7% and the market rose 750 pts, wonder why....
1537 2019-01-05 21:47:24 Hey, this makes me uncomfortable. The issue was not with the team members at Kaikohe, it was with the fact the store no longer stocks books & I'd need to drive to Kerikeri if I want them. Why do you want to know the staff member I spoke to?

1551 2019-01-05 21:36:36 @FoxNews Investing in stocks is a GAMBLE. Do not invest what you can not afford to loose. Market goes up and down. There is no such thing as guaranteed profit in the stock market. The higher the risk, the higher the reward. CAN GO EITHER WAY.  What goes up, comes down.

1552 2019-01-05 21:36:07 Also, people in those upper brackets likely make more in capital gains (stocks, investments etc), than they do in salaried income, which have a tax cap at 20%, meaning that they have a vested interest in their own companies doing very well (as they’ll make more off stock)
1553 2019-01-05 21:36:05 As for drug companies... Is your stance to lower prices before or after you bought or sold all your stocks? Especially with Pzifer???? Duhhhhhh
1554 2019-01-05 21:35:05 And to time both IN/OUT & sector rotation decision is even harder. You might have a rules based risk mgmt trigger for a % trim, but heaving portfolios in&out of stocks & "All Cash" is not the way. That's a shitty PM that can't hold/trust their allocation.

1556 2019-01-05 21:34:19 Very interesting, thanks. Charitably, -4.4% is probably not the level of down market they are trying to protect you from, and 2018 was unusual in that stocks and bonds (and gold) went down at the same time.
1557 2019-01-05 21:32:15 Hi Tweeps! My last full day in the Leewards but checking into @Twitter as usual! #Stocks were so erratic last week it makes me wonder! As for the ongoing #GiletsJaunes riots in France that's a worry too! I've friends who'd have spent $millions in Paris shops but avoided the city!

1617 2019-01-05 20:53:59 Clearly your experiences left you an inaccurate impression. For most private individual landlords, it is an active small business like owning a store, not an investment like stocks and bonds. Corporate landlords are a different breed entirely.

1620 2019-01-05 20:52:01 Theoretically they can change the rules to buy stocks, yes. But my view is the ECB loses control, then the Fed and we have a financial system collapse. At that point Political Tensions will make changing the rules in an emergency difficult if not impossible.

1646 2019-01-05 20:34:20 2019 is the year to start stackinn money boys 

#Crypto | $Btc= down/finding a bottom

These next 1-3 years are going to be some of the best investing opps of your life. 
If you aren’t spending time learning & preparing, I’m sorry
1647 2019-01-05 20:34:19 You must be long pot stocks man. Lol
1648 2019-01-05 20:32:37 Interest rates. When they go up many stocks go down. People expect higher return from interest thus covet yield dividends less as there is more risk there. Not that I am excusing JT in any way. He has ruined this country. So much. So wrong. So quickly.
1649 2019-01-05 20:32:22 Don’t worry. I’m lowering my daily and putting Denali stocks on so I’ll be right there with you
1650 2019-01-05 20:31:25 Markets r unstable due to tech stocks overpriced and fed fucking with interests rates to much. I really need to learn how world works
1651 2019-01-05 20:31:22 U never tell anybody to buy the stocks ,they are barking up the wrong tree
1652 2019-01-05 20:30:54 "I'm buying all stocks of Wolf milk."
1653 2019-01-05 20:30:34 Let's not forget that the Trump tax cuts enabled businesses to buy back their own stocks rather than pass the tax savings on to consumers. Why doesn't Trump mention that?
1654 2019-01-05 20:28:50 How about u do some research on DT, his daddy's ties 2 the mob, their ties 2 Russia, the Kremlin& Putin.

Start w/ Fred Trump's busines/Brighton Beach NY, Trump's in 1980's, Ivana, Cohen's dad, Kushner's dad, Trump properties, diamonds,
David Bogatin, Mike Markowitz, stocks.

1660 2019-01-05 20:26:26 Jsais pas par ex sur SSBU contre les joueurs moins bon que moi je fais comme eux je bourre et comme je bourre "mieux" ben je gagne sinon je me fais ken. Alors que par exemple quand je joue contre mehdi c'est quand je reflechis le plus que jarrive a lui prendre des stocks/games.
1661 2019-01-05 20:26:24 Also home ownership is great. A mortgage is not homeownership, your renting from the bank. Would you take a loan out and make the minimum payment to buy stocks? If the year was 1929 you would.
1662 2019-01-05 20:24:40 That too. I was actually just wondering--is buying stocks from third parties and selling it for higher to other third parties really something worth incentivizing?

Seems like only earnings from directly injecting new money into a company should be so privileged.
1663 2019-01-05 20:24:35 Pelosi takes gavel, stocks tank

1665 2019-01-05 20:21:22 If you're rich enough for Bugattis, yachts, & other toys it's going to represent only a small fraction of your wealth. Most of the liquidity is in stocks, bonds, private equity. 95% of the wealth is either here or in semi-liquid real estate, Dividing up illiquid assets not needed
1666 2019-01-05 20:20:27 The DTF publisher has stocks to clear, so will cut prices. No such incentives for digital publishing.

Also some authors keep digital publishing rights to themselves. So they get more money from digital sales than DTF and even less incentive to drop prices on popular books.
1667 2019-01-05 20:19:20 Dumped my pot stocks before legalization, paid off my house and bought US dollars, if you couldn’t see this coming etc, etc, etc
1668 2019-01-05 20:18:54 Clearly that's how she got all that money for stocks. Not getting suckered by that $6 chicken.
1669 2019-01-05 20:16:07 When buying stocks y always ignore words like we expect to Or will expand y know what I'm getting at
1670 2019-01-05 20:14:45 Trump u do realize that u always project the crimes u commit. 

So 1.7 million pounds of heroin R coming thru ur mafia channels along w/ 17,000 Russian women/children/men w/ m13 & most likely other fire arms?

Must be the 5.6 billion y'all looking 2 launder via stocks

1671 2019-01-05 20:14:41 have gotten crushed this year and it was not due to the general market.  TiO2 stocks dropped to a 1/3 of their value before the market issues.  So, if they can sell the TiO2 asset they may get $10 to $30 mil vs Amir's $230 mil value.  Their offer to date was $25 mil before MOPC.
1672 2019-01-05 20:14:15 Steel industry doesn’t agree with Trump.  Stocks fallen 60% since last year!
1673 2019-01-05 20:13:25 stocks > forex
1674 2019-01-05 20:12:02 probably not enough to bring them into production and profitability.  The market knows this.  So in 12-14 months from now they will get creamed again.  Hopefully their lawyers can get back the seized MOPC properties but any buyer knows that asset is chancy to buy and TiO2 stocks
1675 2019-01-05 20:11:40 After being sat on cash (mainly) since Oct.  Just started to dip toes in the water again. Bought 19 stocks on Thursday. Factor investing based on Quality Value and momentum. I have a 10% stop loss set on each. I’ll reinvest capital from sold stocks into best performers.
1676 2019-01-05 20:11:09 Dividend stocks and funds are great in TFSAs, particularly for retirees. You can milk (withdraw) the dividends as an income stream tax free. Ditto for REITs and preferreds.

1679 2019-01-05 20:05:52 if you're playing with 2 stocks and small timer im just gonna try hard to take your first stock and then circle camp cause clearly you wanna play smash 4 for glory and so imma give you the real experience
1680 2019-01-05 20:05:25 Let me share an old wisdom, a “secret” with you. Whenever a market or any asset gets unusually volatile and volatility is stuck at elevated level, you need to trade the higher (e.g. weekly) time frames. You’ll have a much clearer view. #markets #stocks #trading #trendfollowing
1681 2019-01-05 20:04:30 There's always them people that don't seem to buy any stocks but always have a negative opinion on every other stock (for the sake of it).

If these people were genuine they would tell us why these stocks are shite and which stocks they think are good.
1682 2019-01-05 20:04:08 read an article abt how dispatch tryna kick yg out of big3 and let bighit in..kinda mindblown. it makes so much sense since yg didnt know abt the jenkai thing from the answers they gave the press but sm did, however it still affected both companies their stocks dropped like crazy
1683 2019-01-05 20:03:22 Yes Neeraj. Stocks and markets are more cyclical than what people think.
1684 2019-01-05 20:03:09 Does she know we had a 90% tax rate in the past, and it just about killed our economy during Ike era? Thats why JFK and Reagan did what they did to save the economy. If you tax all the people who provide jobs buy stocks and create an economy to death they leave.
1685 2019-01-05 20:03:02 We can talk about whatever you wanna talk about... Sex, money, drugs, sports, politics, laws, cars, stocks, ratchet shit, trips, military, space... I mean it's whatever! I know about it all. Ion know everything but you can have a conversation with me about whatever

1692 2019-01-05 19:57:19 Why is buying a stock from another person or entity considered investing?

The company doesn't get that money. What have you "invested" in, exactly? Why is money earned from trading stocks around seen as a benefit to society?
1693 2019-01-05 19:56:35 If your in one of these free rooms ask yourself why is this service free are they in stocks ahead of you and want you there to push up their stocks. If you can't find the sucker at the poker table it is most likely you. Free always has a catch. #trading #stocks #rooms
1694 2019-01-05 19:56:22 It really doesn’t matter anymore in light of how formality is fine but not as revered as it used to be but the tenacity of the PK woke is amusing.  They make themselves laughing stocks just by having their nose in the air with that stupid air of superiority.

1696 2019-01-05 19:55:41 It's gonna be fun in quite a short while comparatively, seeing their reactions. Just hold out for a bit, then wave a gold bar or a few stocks of Franco Nevada in their faces... If they can't take the heat...
1697 2019-01-05 19:55:05 I thought he came across a right arrogant cunt, who knew very little about football and had zero interest in building team spirit. He’s a chequebook manager that’s never had a chequebook. Never improves a player, just stocks his squad with dross, then has no idea how to use them.
1698 2019-01-05 19:54:51 AR 15s as well as the assault rifles modified with bump stocks to make them resemble fully automatics. Please saying "assault rifles don't exist" is BS. When a rifle is comparable to a weapon used by the military it shouldn't be in civilian hands. Should I be allowed a tank?
1699 2019-01-05 19:54:40 I’ve done this too! I’ve learnt my corner store actually stocks a HUGE range. Who knew they did more than milk.
1700 2019-01-05 19:53:53 #EIA report indicated weekly #ethanol production down 31k bpd from the week prior at 1.011 million bpd. Ethanol stocks were higher by 29k bar at 23.162 mil bar, with the Midwest the only region to add to their stockpiles, by 509k bar
1701 2019-01-05 19:53:46 Well its ok to fall in luv wit stocks u believe in/investing in so long as it makes sense from all angles. & as the ol saying goes if seems too good to b true usually is in otcland. We all have diff trading strategies & goals too. So jus have to refine, learn & keep movin forward
1702 2019-01-05 19:51:01 So I invest my money in other stocks and maybe after summer I can invest again in $AMRN. When there is better guidances or news . Not before .

1705 2019-01-05 19:50:36 All of those clamoring about science deniers are just pawns helping Al Gore and others to become vastly wealthy. When you know what stocks are being posted, you know how to invest and in what. A hidden insider trading tactic if you will.
1706 2019-01-05 19:49:31 CNBC scrapped their BTC real-time window as soon as it displayed no correlation and low-vol relative to stocks.  Inconvenient for the mainstream narrative to say the least.  Can you say cognitive dissonance? @APompliano

1715 2019-01-05 19:44:29 The problem is the NRA has constantly led the fight to prevent any major legislative effort to study, prevent, &/or stem the rising tide of rampant gun violence in America. 

They lobby for MORE, EASIER access to weapons & deadly toys (silencers, bump stocks). Worse, not better
1716 2019-01-05 19:44:26 Since you know the economy will collapse, please sell all stocks or any other assets you own to protect yourself financially!  After the collapse you’ll be able to buy them back at much lower prices.

And let us know how that works out.

1719 2019-01-05 19:42:15 It could be a good time for investors to pour some money into emerging markets.  Funds like $VWO were hit hard last year, and might pick up some speed if domestic stocks continue to be volatile.

1726 2019-01-05 19:37:49 Actually they would probably pay smaller salaries and bonuses and spend more in the company to boost capital value. They would look more to capital gain in stocks or shares.
1727 2019-01-05 19:37:36 Tell that to the companies who used the money to buy back their stocks while laying off workers. Tell that to the ballooning deficit during a healthy economy. Or just continue ignoring it because... Well, I don't really know why you do.
1728 2019-01-05 19:37:06 With all the corruption that’s going on in congress. You think bad words are the biggest concern?There are congressmen buying and trading stocks in companies they’re making policies on.Using tax payers money 2go on vacations.Those things have no place in congress not words

1731 2019-01-05 19:34:48 It seems like to own a business. All you have to do is lower your profit first whether if it’s giving out free samples , or cheaper prices then once you gain enough customers. You can raise more profit & stocks
1732 2019-01-05 19:34:35 When I went to Georgia Southern.. I majored in chemistry.. then I changed 3 times  computer science, chemistry.. I love chemistry but I end up doing marketing and business finance : I told my advisor I wanted to trade stocks for a living .
1733 2019-01-05 19:33:33 As the ATF correctly noted under President Obama, a bump stock doesn't turn a firearm into a machinegun for purposes of the NFA. Banning bump stocks is completely possible, but requires Congress to pass a new law.

@sonicmega carried tf outta me. He took all 6 stocks game 1 lmaooooo
1739 2019-01-05 19:30:50 It does not means zero AT ALL! Among other things, it means people have money to eat, drink, dance, AND buy stocks. That people are confident to buy papers instead of food, thus making money work to spin the economy as a whole. The list is very long, shall I go on?
1740 2019-01-05 19:30:47 #Halfords are going to have to increase their stocks of #yellowvests - the whole country is getting on board with this one !
1741 2019-01-05 19:27:35 Div on stocks held less than 121 days is usually taxed as regular income. Div held longer than that are usually taxed as long term capital gains which max out at 20%. The debate on rates in DC is centered on reg income. It shouldn’t be allowed to stay that way. Income is income.
1742 2019-01-05 19:26:58 The stock market is easy to follow but isn’t the whole economic story. 84% of stocks are owned by only the richest 10% of Americans. Only the richest half of the U.S. owns *any* stock at all. Broad-based prosperity to secure the nation means raising *wages*. Let’s focus on that.

*Record China trade deficit
*Nearly $1T budget deficit
*Nat'l debt $22T
*Life expectancy drop
*40k gun deaths

Where's the winning???
You're a failure!
1746 2019-01-05 19:25:51 You picked an oil lobbyist to run the EPA. Then you picked a coal lobbyist to replace him. You picked a billionaire that never went to public school to run the DOE.

1753 2019-01-05 19:18:18 Actually, ever since this banning of bump stocks and the rifle/shotgun purchase age becoming 21 in Washington . Gun owners are starting to despise of Trump and the NRA for doing anything about it. People are currently investing into the GOA these days. Politics is so divided lol
1754 2019-01-05 19:17:46 Stocks, that's not too hard.

1757 2019-01-05 19:14:24 Felt a little silly flipping $ARK for only 7% profit after two months. Then realized some people hold stocks a whole year for less. Some people don't invest at all.

1760 2019-01-05 19:13:06 This is the complete fan irrationality. Buying a commodity to only sell it at its lowest point in value. This is like if you purchased stocks pre-2008 and then sold them after the market tanked.
1761 2019-01-05 19:12:43 Team Nemeziz dominates team Copa 4-1.

1764 2019-01-05 19:11:31 For stock selection strategies, high dispersion is a good environment.  Look for when average volatility of a stock’s return >> volatility of the average return of stocks (over some suitable universe).
1765 2019-01-05 19:11:11 Maybe they would be happier with old public shaming techniques like the stocks in the public square.  SMDH
1766 2019-01-05 19:10:45 Guys, You don’t invest in Shares or hold shares. You trade or hold invest into Digital Stocks. MPS tokenized the stocks and back each digital stock with 1 :1 where you are entitled to dividends too. We are preparing a document where all the questions will be answered.
1767 2019-01-05 19:09:33 Maybe if @GaryLineker paid his taxes we could afford more stocks of medicines.
1768 2019-01-05 19:09:24 I can see the Graunaid title now: Britain (and Tories) shame as NHS Bloodbank stocks denied to Exhiled French Vampires.

1770 2019-01-05 19:08:12 No se si la palabra “coin” es adecuada. Todas esas redes son efectivamente compañías, con dueños claros definiendo el destino de su red. Así que se asemejan más a acciones bursátiles, “stocks” que a monedas. Aparte, ser moneda no es el objetivo de esas compañías.

And had no overall effect on crime.
1774 2019-01-05 19:03:27 It isn’t laws it’s rules, not the same thing.  It’s ethic rules, at least he is up front about it, how did Harper become a millionaire while PM and what was in those stocks?  Like I said, like Trumps tax return.
1775 2019-01-05 19:02:58 Short term is more like Shahid. Sehwag stocks are the ‘cool trend’ stocks which perform well, until@the trend wears off.

1778 2019-01-05 19:00:50 2/ the stock market. In 2018 the Dow fell 5.6%, the S&P 500 6.2% and the Nasdaq 4% making it the worst year for stocks since 2008. All because of volatility introduced by misguided policies from 45, the man who declared bankrupcy 6 times. And despite his claims, coal
1779 2019-01-05 19:00:40 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
1780 2019-01-05 19:00:03 You are deranged. Guns have nothing to do with Trump. As a matter of fact he just outlawed bump stocks which Obama approved. This was a domestic dispute.  In the state thats controlled by democrats with the strictest gun laws.
1781 2019-01-05 18:59:43 No more 2 stocks, please...
1782 2019-01-05 18:59:16 Music is also different bc it’s a personal thing us artist produce, it comes from the soul, when do stocks or sell house that’s material, there may be a connection but not as  significant as something you create. That’s why it’s harder to detach from the fact that ppl being shady
1783 2019-01-05 18:57:51 why do people play 2 stocks
1784 2019-01-05 18:57:40 We've still got a few wristbands to give away with a Start Collecting! set (or equivalent).  Pop down tomorrow to claim yours (whilst stocks last!)
1785 2019-01-05 18:56:07 Most shops seem to have their stocks in already
1786 2019-01-05 18:54:26 Most of the Scottish fishermen around the coast with family owned boats who fish sustainably don't support this policy, not because they don't support conservation, but because there are better ways to do it than a 3nm limit, for the stocks & the coastal communities.
1787 2019-01-05 18:54:23 just finished watching this movie called "billionaire boys club" bc i had nothing to watch and taron egerton and ansel elgort are in the movie. man the movie was full of investing, stocks, trading, basically money HAHAHA thanks Sir Alex, bc of u naintindihan ko yung movie HAHAHA
1788 2019-01-05 18:54:11 But what if pretty soon every girl is selling the hair products, then who’s left to buy them??? The market is getting too saturated....stocks are plummeting.....pull your money from the banks pUT IT UNDER YOUR MATTRESS
1789 2019-01-05 18:53:30 Been this way for a while. You can track xrp but can’t trade it. Nothing more than being able to see xrp charts on the Apple stocks app.

Some stocks are just starting and will show massive gains if all goes according to plan but can you wait?  Look for the bottom and get as close to it as you can but know what, why, & how long.  Know!
1792 2019-01-05 18:51:32 Penny stocks, bruh.

1794 2019-01-05 18:51:04 Instead of building more, they bought back their own stocks.. It just shows the stock market really is a ponsi scheme.

1797 2019-01-05 18:50:14 Most articles about penny stocks in USA are posted by short groups ...
1798 2019-01-05 18:49:45 TIL: You can add currency exchange rates in Stocks. Thank you, kind sir!
1799 2019-01-05 18:49:17 I’m new to the market- what did you shirt back then in 2008-2011? A whole bunch of stuff or just a few stocks?
1800 2019-01-05 18:47:49 I would hedge - only if I own stocks.  Otherwise, I either buy puts or calls depending on the earning sentiment - kind of lottery.  Due to high volatility, the premiums are so high and often straddles does not return much.  Again, it depends on personal choices.
1801 2019-01-05 18:47:03 #SuperSmashBrosUltimate @NintendoAmerica YOU NEED SERVERS! I seriously just lost 2 stocks from a single fall. We need better connection!
1802 2019-01-05 18:46:37 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
1803 2019-01-05 18:46:31 Thank you Walter , really important here to keep individual stocks up ...need more new highs but a great int term bottom seems to be in place...my guess a test of old highs but no go 2019
1804 2019-01-05 18:46:28 If this is true some people would have large stocks in place in order to make a mint.
But entrepreneurs are not as gullible as journalists.
1805 2019-01-05 18:46:02 I don't think those people who would pay 70% are working for their money. It's inherited wealth in stocks and other investments.
1806 2019-01-05 18:44:20 Thank god for stocks. I needs the moneyyy
1807 2019-01-05 18:43:56 You hit on a really important issue that gets overlooked: long-term capital gain taxation. I was a stockbroker and saw how much the 1% made and how little they had to pay in taxes from stocks (15-20% at most). We need to treat capital gains like hard-earned ordinary income.
1808 2019-01-05 18:43:00 and he couldn't even put that in stocks for investment, what real billionaire puts their name water or steaks lol
1809 2019-01-05 18:42:48 Dump the FANG stocks; the 8yr cyclical run since WWII is coming to an end. Sell now, buy later when the bloodbath is over in 6 months 
1810 2019-01-05 18:42:44 KTR is contract.....I'm a freak about munition stocks...Any engagement with Russia / China/ DPRK will deplete our stocks quickly and Russia / China / DPRK don't appear to have that issue.  (DPRK stocks are mostly primitive but still plentiful).
1811 2019-01-05 18:42:30 Now I’m interested in real estate...

Let me get this music shit on the road, all that money Is going into stocks & land 
1812 2019-01-05 18:42:18 Are you remotely familiar at all with the $WVE platform? Or are you just guessing that stocks can’t go up a lot? My guess is that you never owned $REGN or $ALXN
1813 2019-01-05 18:42:04 Have given up reading anything DT says about Trump as they are so obviously biased against him. Friday it was announced that there were 312000 new jobs in the US in the last quarter almost double predictions and other figures that sent stocks soaring 5% in one day. Give it a rest

1815 2019-01-05 18:41:09 Perhaps. But it is an opportunity to buy good stocks at affordable prices.
1816 2019-01-05 18:40:53 He is making any and all efforts to attempt to protect his tanking stocks. Doesn't seem to matter to him if his efforts are unethical, immoral, or just downright wrong.
1817 2019-01-05 18:39:55 Stop this retarded ass gangbanging shit! Niggas is quick to end generations of families by killing them over blocks & streets they don't own but will NEVER have that same energy with coming together to start businesses and get stocks in companies, rebuild and uplift communities!
1818 2019-01-05 18:39:36 Que se puede esperar de usted que cree que stocks en Mercado de capitales son inventarios y que la pobreza del país se resuelve vendiendo aguacates.... me quedo 1.000.000.000.000 de veces con Duque, Fajardo, Vargas Lleras o Pinzon
1819 2019-01-05 18:38:43 WRONG!  Stocks have plummeted lately.  #checkyourfacts #ResignNow
1820 2019-01-05 18:37:07 70%? That’s insane. What you should do is to tax revenue from stocks more
1821 2019-01-05 18:36:44 Not one of the great pick. You still can find great opportunity in other stocks if you see. Will share some if I see 1 is to 2 or 1 is to 3 on Monday.  Huge margin blockage.
1822 2019-01-05 18:36:34 Well I quess I picked the right stocks. All the new jobs, unemployment numbers and wage growth are just A mirage. Can you imagine if Trump actually wins on China’s trade war.
1823 2019-01-05 18:36:32 Surely he’ll keg it. 
1824 2019-01-05 18:34:36 OECD oil stocks are up due to increased production from US, Saudi Arabia and Russia.  Both US and Russia hit record production this year.  US is on pace to increase export by 1 MBPD a year, while OPEC is trying to cut that much to stabilize the price.  #fsuenergy #russianoil
1825 2019-01-05 18:32:54 But in the end, the sum total was still Crowley’s. S6 showed it, he had total control over hell’s soul stocks.

1828 2019-01-05 18:31:32 Do you honestly believe that the majority of the general population has a “real estate portfolio”, “stocks” OR a “401k” ???
1829 2019-01-05 18:30:56 Best time to buy #Stocks, #Crypto, etc. is when everyone is panicking & the’experts’ are loosing their shirts

1831 2019-01-05 18:28:40 We need the stocks brought back for individuals like these. As a punishment stick em in the stocks for a month and all the neighbours come and dump their rubbish over them.
1832 2019-01-05 18:28:12 That man checking his stocks and savings
1833 2019-01-05 18:28:02 I can answer that for you, since I've been hedged. No you cannot, order does not get filled. You also wont be able to short a lot of stocks anymore. Shortsize 0 now actually means something, with cfd's that did not matter.
1834 2019-01-05 18:26:42 Ohhh so they are clearing the stocks huh, wish you have a new one soon!
1835 2019-01-05 18:24:30 What about taxing capital gains as income? I am fairly certain I worked at least as hard digging trenches in the Marines as someone who makes money on stocks.
1836 2019-01-05 18:22:38 OMG, it is so simple. But for those who are mentally challenged :

everyone = everyone with any interest in health
what should we do? = continue normally without panic. You know chemists order stocks, producers produce, importers import, patients use drugs sensibly. Okay?
1837 2019-01-05 18:21:58 Great stuff EB, proof it can be done  January is looking really good, need to approach with caution still and look for those stocks with decent fundamentals or the ones getting the massive ramp and ride the trade wave 
1838 2019-01-05 18:21:56 Perhaps a way is to tax certain income types differently (like stocks) vs income brackets. Also tax certain purchases (entertainment, luxury) differently vs routine consumer goods. Obviously not as simple as I put it.
1839 2019-01-05 18:21:49 He's an idiot. So many of his stocks are tanking and he hated on SX.
1840 2019-01-05 18:21:27 Yeah, just like how all the companies that JUST got hella tax cuts turned around and uh *squints at notes* bought back as many stocks as possible, gave themselves hella raises, and laid people off.

... wait
1841 2019-01-05 18:21:24 Hardly. They actually got the A+ rated governor to change the law around gun safety. Not as much as they might have liked, but not nothing either. Orange Foolius just banned bump stocks too. Keep better track of current events.
1842 2019-01-05 18:20:17 Will be by 830 ish
1843 2019-01-05 18:19:56 Are you there now
1844 2019-01-05 18:19:37 How about a 1% financial tax on the purchase of stocks,  bonds and other financial instruments.  Don't understand how sales taxes on everything are accepted but not on financial instruments.
1845 2019-01-05 18:19:12 Best team won 
1846 2019-01-05 18:19:11 Pues usted no sabe que son stocks con stocks de inventarios y es economista y ya sabemos que se puede esperar de usted. Asesinar magistrados por un lado y tirarse una ciudad con su mala gestión por el otro
1847 2019-01-05 18:18:57 Mr. Price also stocks some. I saw at the one in Sarit. 
1848 2019-01-05 18:18:18 1st of all, it was not trumps win. It was President Obama's. 2nd, most of the tax relief from former Replb. congress, was used to buy back their stocks, repay loans, & pay bonuses to their top tier exec.'s. The economy is however, starting to take a dump due to trumps/rep doing.
1849 2019-01-05 18:17:20 S&P 500 was -20.4% peak to trough. Small cap and international stocks worse. Commodities prices & TIPS breakevens falling. All good reasons for Fed to pause rate hikes.
1850 2019-01-05 18:17:17 And no amount of bump stocks, Viagra or misogyny would get that micro-penis to grow, @NRA ! 
2019, and they still hoping I guess.
1851 2019-01-05 18:17:14 yeah hold on lemme get my stocks back
1852 2019-01-05 18:17:13 Sir please suggest 5 stocks for long term. I will hold it for 10 years or more....@AnilSinghviZEE @iamrakeshbansal @kunalsaraogi  my favorite sir @iamVishChauhan
1853 2019-01-05 18:17:05 agree, most Americans enter adulthood with abysmally little understanding of taxes, interest, banking, mortgages, loans, stocks/bonds/investing, insurance, budgeting, etc. Lamentable.
1854 2019-01-05 18:16:24 - Worst stock market since Great Recession

- 800K fed workers (>200K Vets) with no pay

1858 2019-01-05 18:14:44 As ive just explained i know from first hand knowledge that medicine stocks are affected. I have also seen 15k knocked off my pension, with the fund manager in no doubt why the value dropped sharply. People can see effects with their own eyes right now.
1859 2019-01-05 18:14:18 Can we buy stocks in that HESCO company?
1860 2019-01-05 18:14:18 Its almost uncanny how brazilian stocks surged after his election.

1863 2019-01-05 18:12:38 I hope you do a better job going after these governors than you did with bump stocks and red flag laws. Oh wait a minute you didn't bother fighting those did you. While I'm a member your actions have casued me to join GOA not sure if I'm renewing with you guys or not!
1864 2019-01-05 18:12:33 If this market can get going, a few of the software stocks look ready to blast out. I am sure you know which ones.
1865 2019-01-05 18:12:09 Stocks
1866 2019-01-05 18:11:02 It might be a good job report but I’m on my 6th contract job (vs a permanent role) in the last 5 years and I make $2 less an hour now than I did a year ago. I couldn’t care less about the job report or unemployment rate or stocks or the market. None of that reflects my life.
1867 2019-01-05 18:10:55 Just 5% of the better growth actors show solid-to-extreme accumulation, an extremely low number, vs. the 40%-55% seen during much of '17-'18 #stocks

1870 2019-01-05 18:09:53 I wish other people would do this. Lol not announce when re stocks are happening... just let them happen and say surprise bitches 
1871 2019-01-05 18:09:25 "The right" is presumably in charge at this very moment, and they're... banning bump stocks, at a time when they should be abolishing the ATF.

The right is so impotent, they allow things to drift in the direction of Hogg's desired "progress" within a year.
1872 2019-01-05 18:09:15 small changes to my trading education after I could trade the markets part-time : I will publish nightly watchlists for possible stocks that may move next day. Maybe it could be a good way to specify some swing setups, not intraday exclusively.
1873 2019-01-05 18:07:45 Así me siento cuando compró stocks que obtienen buen beneficio y justamente mi análisis técnico arrojaba un futuro prometedor jajaja
1874 2019-01-05 18:07:36 Stocks are a ponzi scheme, you know this. They don't help economies and are not an accurate measure of prosperity. I dont have time to explain how bonds actually help gov's but you have google

1877 2019-01-05 18:06:10 Then you provide incentives to companies to reinvest back into their companies and employees and lower their taxes to under 20% if they reinvest instead of now just buying back stocks and screwing the employees.
1878 2019-01-05 18:05:28 Luke, as always love the line of reasoning and agree Fed has to “let the dollar go” (as well as choose policies supportive of USTs and stocks).  But is the dollar’s fate entirely in its hands, if foreign CBs don’t want to tolerate too much appreciation of their own currencies?
1879 2019-01-05 18:03:35 EDA stocks ended the week at a flat 0.0%, with @Synopsys taking the lead.
1880 2019-01-05 18:03:16 What lmao smash 4 had two stocks 6 minutes so 3 minutes each stock why not the same for ultimate it makes sense I think 8 is fine but your argument personally doesn’t make much sense to me
1881 2019-01-05 18:03:02 Equipment stocks eked out 0.4%, BESI led the pack this week. With @Veeco and Applied Materials @Applied4Tech close behind. Assembly and WFE grew this week, 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. Test sunk 2.8%.
1882 2019-01-05 18:00:34 The only way apple gon get me off this 8plus is if this bitch blow up . Apple stocks fell hard this past week.

1884 2019-01-05 18:00:03 Tip 4: Of course, you're looking for deals and low prices, but stay away from penny stocks. These stocks are often illiquid, and chances of hitting a jackpot are often bleak. Unless you see a real opportunity here and have done your research, stay clear of these.
1885 2019-01-05 17:59:12 It’ll be stocks & shares next
1886 2019-01-05 17:58:57 Hello, that is 3 years. Check the last few months stocks. Then, ask me questions.

1889 2019-01-05 17:57:30 the official ruleset for competitive smash ultimate should be 6 stocks, 21 minutes, best of 18, and all stages should be legal but for the shulk one because i hate it

1893 2019-01-05 17:55:10 Global stocks soared Friday and reversed the big losses they suffered just a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 746 points.

1902 2019-01-05 17:51:16 4.  Prosperity tainted by capitalism, which, as you may have noticed, continues to the present day, and in which we all are willing collaborators, irrespective of nation, but especially if we own stocks or pension plans
1903 2019-01-05 17:51:14 You own stocks, don't you think a lower capital gains tax rate would benefit you? You're not rich, you're trying to become rich, let's implement policies that will make it easier for you to keep more of your money.

1906 2019-01-05 17:49:00 I have a feeling many #debt investors have been shorting these O&G, shipping stocks and for example #offshore #oil drillers heavily while targeting their debt. Create distress on the equity side to fill your debt portfolio at cheaper prices. That's how I would do it...

1908 2019-01-05 17:45:11 Great article Jon. I would add The Big Short to the best trading films. I thought they did a good job with the trading desk banter. Some firms have employed the relative ranking system. I was at a firm a while ago that required us to rank our stocks and sells to equal buys.
1909 2019-01-05 17:44:11 And what will you be taxing exactly? Net worth isn't the same as having that amount of money in a bank account. I could have a billion worth of stocks without necessarily having a single usable dollar
1910 2019-01-05 17:44:01 Stocks o Crypto? Este año, 70/30. 
Recomendación para quien la quiera tomar
1911 2019-01-05 17:43:40 @BitLifeApp could you make it so we could make&manage our own businesses & also maybe do stocks?
1912 2019-01-05 17:43:38 apple stocks rise by 10%.
1913 2019-01-05 17:42:36 My own personal experience is that these Pico Cap stocks Gap higher when the market turns. Sadly one needs to be early when owning these pain maker stocks.  Sigh.
1914 2019-01-05 17:42:30 I need to find someone I trust or at least know has no interest in fucking me over to teach me how to invest in stocks & such
1915 2019-01-05 17:42:22 looking to trade GLO then the present liquidity is an issue.  But, it is profitable today and when they open the U Ops the CEO said this will be profitable from day 1 too.  Really?  That is huge.  So, all stocks have pros and cons.  This one has so many Pros of significance.
1916 2019-01-05 17:41:58 47 street stocks at Dillon
1917 2019-01-05 17:41:47 Distressing yes. But what are YOU doing about it for your family. For Pete's sake do not rely on soothing "keep calm" messages . I sorted my family's emergency stocks and provisions based Italian earthquakes (we know about) last summer.
1918 2019-01-05 17:40:55 Actually, you have never stated that. Luckily for you, because it would just have boosted the number of silly inaccuracies that you sputter. Stock markets have always done better under Democrats. 2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008, on your watch.
1919 2019-01-05 17:40:44 #Stocks,#Indexes We do not imply that a major top is necessarily expected next week.
1920 2019-01-05 17:39:52 Now it it's SHTF and something critical to sustaining my friends/family for another day, like personal money, a vehicle, food stocks, whatever the situation demands.. I'll hang his head on a pike defending it. I'd fall back, report robbery and let cops shoot him... Over a straw.
1921 2019-01-05 17:39:50 If one would have pick frontline stocks when market is at 10,050  then their return is somewhere b/w 20-25%
1922 2019-01-05 17:39:37 Tip 3: As a beginner, it is advisable to focus on a maximum of one to two stocks during a trading session. With just a few stocks, tracking and finding opportunities is easier.

1924 2019-01-05 17:37:49 Face it. These people are greedy AF and they could care less if we drink toilet water. It’s  all a ruse to make it seem like they are so special. What did most of them do with their #Trumptaxcut? They bought back their stocks and did not give us raises or hire more. #GreedyAF
1925 2019-01-05 17:37:46 Why can't we do that now? Are there EU laws setting out what food miles should be or restricting us from growing more food? As fish stocks are declining, should we "land more of our fish" or should we have quotas to ensure that fish stocks last?
1926 2019-01-05 17:36:28 Montana Gop house rep Greg
 "The journalist body slammer" gianforte owns stocks in Russian companies! Can any reporters dig into that?
Montana gop sen daines went to russia july 4th! Montana gop are traitors!
1927 2019-01-05 17:36:06 took 2 cloud stocks in like under 30 seconds and then they just SD'd the last one :pensive:
1928 2019-01-05 17:35:47 Remarkably liberal actually - he should be horse-whipped through the town, spend a couple of days in the stocks and then hanged
1929 2019-01-05 17:35:43 @kevinomccarthy  congrats on ya new position...Nancy Pelosi is hated by the American Samoans with a passion...because her California tuna fish ass husband owned mega stocks in the tuna industry she denied them a minimum wage increase a few years back./ Congress is chickenchyts
1930 2019-01-05 17:35:41 Fund managers and investors pick their stocks only when market in deep correction. Because value always lies in beaten down quality stocks
1931 2019-01-05 17:35:15 Not being in financial circles, but paying more attention now...I find this tweet amusing. Clearly, unsurprising to your followers. But, takes me back to investments class & the VIX topic: 
one can buy options 
 on an index (VIX) of options
 of an index (SP500) of stocks

1934 2019-01-05 17:34:57 I’m adding to my drug company stocks making those double strength psychiatric meds.  Imagine their sales to the GOP base when @realDonaldTrump starts getting impeached and into prison.
1935 2019-01-05 17:33:59 And from one such similar data the % of stocks tend to remain for 3 more weeks nearly a months time
1936 2019-01-05 17:33:15 Actually, high taxes promoted investment, since they provided incentives to pay less taxes if they invested in businesses. Taxpayers learned that the best way to make more money was to grow their income by investing  in real business activities, not just stocks.
1937 2019-01-05 17:33:08 The risk is not in our stocks - but in our socks (ourselves )

1938 2019-01-05 17:32:37 @ARMYYYYY_yoongs I see you liking my tweets, HMV stocks ggs now, they have Red Velvet and TWICE atm 
1939 2019-01-05 17:32:37 Well he did hire that ass whole fed chief....so yes the down turn in stocks and housing is due to hiring the fed chief who is a moron..
1940 2019-01-05 17:32:36 @AOC is right to get us thinking radically about tax reform. We’ve had high marginal tax rates before. 70% ain’t radical. Radical would be to tax wage income the same as income from stocks. That’s where $10M taxpayers live. #Bronx #goals
1941 2019-01-05 17:31:13 @GregForMontana do you still own those stocks in Russian companies!?
1942 2019-01-05 17:29:54 Kindly make a fair policy sir,when no stocks no use of floating any scheme...Deep respect... good and best products but bad management No proper stocks no proper reply. @_narendrabansal @sardana_nidhi
1943 2019-01-05 17:29:38 The 4 Worst Dividend Stocks For A Bearish 2019 - Forbes The 4 Worst Dividend Stocks For A Bearish 2019  Forbes

What good is a 2% or 3% annual yield if you can lose it in a single trading session? The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 are officially in bear markets, which means ...
1944 2019-01-05 17:29:13 Here's my advice to anyone following stocks on Twitter: Assume everyone is a paid shill. Never take anything from a Twitter "Guru" without a grain a salt. If your portfolio is mostly highly "pumped" stocks on twitter, you probably aren't doing your own homework.
1945 2019-01-05 17:28:09 @Apple 's biggest problem is that no one wants to trade in a $1000 iPhone for another $1000 iPhone. Good companies support old products and aim for longevity. @tim_cook is just looking to stockpile cash. I'm looking for other tech stocks to hold. Apple is a sell for me.
1946 2019-01-05 17:27:08 Another very impt point that is misunderstood: money paid to the government is spent and helps the economy. The very rich, however, can only buy so many yachts so past a certain amt, most is invested in land, stocks, and bonds, which is largely unproductive for the economy.
1947 2019-01-05 17:26:39  fair enough! It’s stocks and shares mate. Great way to gamble. I’d highly recommend
1948 2019-01-05 17:26:00 "Get a 401k and invest in stocks."
1949 2019-01-05 17:25:56 I'm glad the stocks are dropping. That means less agregious monetization and more quality shit. Not from Activision or EA, but quality shit elsewhere. I have high hopes for 2019.
1950 2019-01-05 17:25:38 As the author knows, it’s not the proportion of revenue derived from the 1% that’s relevant to public policy debate about taxes in most developed economies, it’s the proportion of their total income (stocks, funds etc...) that’s taxed at all. There’s 2 divergent tax systems today
1951 2019-01-05 17:25:23 Everton are very average ! On the plus side, Liverpool has a head of steam Beb 
1952 2019-01-05 17:24:37 To anyone that has any Tesla stocks.. sell em. Asap.
1953 2019-01-05 17:24:16 These 3 Stocks Turned $1,000 Into $7,000 -- in Just 1 Year! -  #cloudcomputing
1954 2019-01-05 17:23:54 What happened in the last 2 months? O that's right the democrats took over the house no wonder why they stocks fell they were planning ahead of  all the free stuff they want to give to other countries
1955 2019-01-05 17:22:28 @Ripple what about an exchange of value from traditional forex stocks to crypto mega use case for @xrp #help the investors get out fast
1956 2019-01-05 17:21:52 And while scams occurred (just like in any market, even "Regulated penny stocks" which are far worse), creative destruction occurred as well. I'd prefer the so-called "Wild West" over endless bureaucracy, politics & middlemen. But the free market is unappreciated & misunderstood.
1957 2019-01-05 17:21:22 Bump stocks aren't gun rights.
1958 2019-01-05 17:21:17 Yeah bond buying happens during economic downturns when stocks don't a fetch a safe or high return
1959 2019-01-05 17:20:56 It improved my opinion of them.  By never trying to get rid of them, the NRA has shown that it's fine with major restrictions on machine guns, which bump stocks and trigger cranks amount to an end run around.  This is consistent & demonstrates that the NRA does have limits.
1960 2019-01-05 17:20:51 Probably had pharma stocks lmao
1961 2019-01-05 17:20:50 Many @porinju high conviction stocks have done the same....Lanco is not even trading...Sunil Hitech is about to zonto zero....and so on....
1962 2019-01-05 17:18:42 Just don't forget to turn in your bump stocks, traitors.
1963 2019-01-05 17:17:28 The debt is not a walk in the park but real estate and stocks are not bubbles. This debt load is only going to increase over time and that is an entirely different conversation than discussing stock bubbles. P/Es are too low to call stocks a bubble and real estate is fine too.
1964 2019-01-05 17:17:08 Sally, lives on Via Corazon with 9 cats.

Put all their savings into cayenne pepper stocks. Can't retire.
1965 2019-01-05 17:16:21 Elites (CIA) start war, (Elite media) gets lower classes fired up to fight, get them killed, puts middle class into war debt, makes billions on defense stocks, keeps foreign markets open on cheap products and labor. Repeat.
1966 2019-01-05 17:16:14 $AAPL - quote @JimCramer: "Own #Apple, don't trade it". FYI, your buddy @CGasparino said on @FoxBusiness yesterday that "Jim Cramer knows nothing about the economy." Ouch ! I enjoy your knowledge of all the co's you cover but disagree abt the value of the high PE stocks you love.
1967 2019-01-05 17:16:13 Poor people are actually the ones who buy goods and services and contribute to the economy. Wealthy people hoarding wealth or investing in stocks does nothing for the economy.
1968 2019-01-05 17:15:38 Don't mind that poster he's one of those people who loves his country and capitalism and is probably up to his eyeballs in stocks like $AAPL at $200+. He just wants one last chance to sell. The audacity of some calling you a doom and gloomer. Pitiful really.
1969 2019-01-05 17:15:00 I'm w/ u @WolfOfWeedST Even if they sold their entire 66,127,375 Class 2 Stock, their 16,666,667 Class 1 stocks are 10votes ea, so they still have majority voting power & control, so why wouldn't they sell? W/ full control they make the rules & will give themselves more shares!
1970 2019-01-05 17:14:41 The gaps are killer on both sides up and down. Last time I remember times like this was 08-09 which was volatile but also bottoms were put in as well. Stocks bottomed before the indices did. Stocks bottomed I’m fed while indices bottomed in feb-March I believe
1971 2019-01-05 17:14:18 I’m sure once gun regulations become a lot stricter that all the bad people with illegal guns will all the sudden follow the rules and abide by the rules. Just like the recent bump stock ban. I’m sure all the criminals are turning in their bump stocks right now
1972 2019-01-05 17:14:10 I wonder which stocks those 'pessimists' are shorting?
1973 2019-01-05 17:13:06 Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla stocks to be tokenized on #Ethereum #Blockchain - not sure what problem is being solved here, but it is backed by institutional money!
1974 2019-01-05 17:10:05 And 50% Capital gains tax on stocks
1975 2019-01-05 17:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1976 2019-01-05 17:08:02 That was a great presentation!

1977 2019-01-05 17:07:17 I have stocks of jet airways, ONGC, CONCOR, SIEMENS. future details of these stocks in upcoming months
1978 2019-01-05 17:05:51 Exactly. Their stocks were pretty low until she showed up & then they sky rocketed in sales.
1979 2019-01-05 17:03:21 Need to get me one of his pro stocks
1980 2019-01-05 17:03:06 a silly reply? Do you honestly think it’s a concern for people in lower income brackets? Something like 85% of stocks are owned by the richest 10%.
1981 2019-01-05 17:02:27 You hit it in the nail: I’ve already red to buy stocks being so low...seriously?!

1989 2019-01-05 16:59:24 I would have more sympathy with the save parlington campaign if some of those same voices didn’t oppose the stocks blocks development near us, that is a classic brownfield infill type development that they apparently prefer
1990 2019-01-05 16:59:02 @DETaylor1988 @carlstubbs92 @SmallBeerLtd @adam_stocks_ bomber command, marquis of granby, the wig and mitre, yellow bellies. Your boys took one hell of a beating . Seriously well played Lincoln 
1991 2019-01-05 16:57:08 December was the worst month for stocks since 2009, and it is an uncertain bear market at the moment.
1992 2019-01-05 16:56:44 i wanna find someone who can teach me how to flip stocks fr
1993 2019-01-05 16:56:10 80% of stocks are owned by 20% of the wealthiest
1994 2019-01-05 16:56:07 اعتقد ان الجيل يحسب على مولد الشخص نفسه يعني لكل منا جيل وهي على النحو التالي من كان مولده الي يوم مولدك يساوي ١٥ سنه يدخل في جيلك .
 يعني الجيل ٣٠ سنه ١٥ قبل و١٥ بعد من مولدك .
هذا والله اعلم
1995 2019-01-05 16:54:54 I've never owned physical gold. I do see a case for a very small position in gold stocks -- maybe 2% -- coupled with a rigorous rebalancing program. The gold stocks should be a decent diversifier and the rebalancing bonus should allow you to generate a modest real return.
1996 2019-01-05 16:54:49 Thank you
1997 2019-01-05 16:54:48 Do you think tech stocks and "the internet" are the same thing?
1998 2019-01-05 16:54:18 Nope. Has history has shown time and again, giving wealthy business owners more cash does not translate to more jobs and higher wages. Most of the cash from the new tax plan were used to buy backs stocks to improve the cost per share on the the balance sheet.
1999 2019-01-05 16:53:22 Stocks paid dividends
2000 2019-01-05 16:52:56 Potential economic explanations (other than variance) for the rise of growth stocks, and whether the trend could conceivably continue/strengthen.
2001 2019-01-05 16:52:22 That is such a silly reply, you don't have to be a trader or high income to invest in stocks but the less free cash flow you have the more tricky it is to choose to lock up your money for an extended time.
2002 2019-01-05 16:52:14 It's time to sell apple's stocks dude!
2003 2019-01-05 16:51:52 unfortunately the gradual adaption will need to take place between 30th march and whenever stocks run out...
2004 2019-01-05 16:51:23 Savings and banks are stupid. Throw that shit in stocks.
2005 2019-01-05 16:50:24 Paul warned everyone to sell stocks when Trump got elected. He has terrible insight.
2006 2019-01-05 16:49:36 How to choose stocks for this strategy?
2007 2019-01-05 16:49:32 Easing fears of a recession, the labor market bounced back resoundingly in December as employers added 312,000 jobs 
2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade.
2008 2019-01-05 16:49:31 With 3 stocks ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2009 2019-01-05 16:49:08 Long term stocks are like Rahul Dravids batting... consistent, boring, predictable. Small cap stocks are like @virendersehwag 's. . Unpredictable but the day he fires, he creates unimaginable magic. The Portfolio needs the the whole team to perform at different times. Diversify.
2010 2019-01-05 16:47:42 For what it’s worth, some 29% of SP500 revenues are international. Course, I have no idea what % of global stocks’ revenue is US. I suppose a trade deficit would imply it’s less than 29%.

2012 2019-01-05 16:46:49 Apparently depends on stocks’ next move. We’re back to tail wagging the dog policy.
2013 2019-01-05 16:46:31 Well, depends on your choice? Not all like that! Just like stocks, need to do your DD  Controlling and Intrusive, or autonomous and supportive? Your choice!
2014 2019-01-05 16:46:27 Buffet straight up says he should be taxed more. Also no one “earns” that amount of wealth. Gates used monopolistic practises at Microsoft to extract his wealth and buffet is a glorified gambler (what stocks really are)
2015 2019-01-05 16:46:26 I always wondered this. My charity only stocks window envelopes because we use them for everything else but we get different colours so they don’t look like bills.
2016 2019-01-05 16:46:10 Check the P.E. ratio of the stocks while buying them. PE ratio = Market price/EPS. EPS is earnings per share. In the easiest language, PE ratio represents the undervaluation or overvaluation of a stock.
2017 2019-01-05 16:45:14 @RonnieMoas hi Ronnie, just wanted to know if you are planning on putting out a new update(for crypto/stocks) to your subscribers soon? Thanks so much! Happy new year

2019 2019-01-05 16:44:43 If there a bull they shoulda been buying not complaining. But then again I play stocks not options.
2020 2019-01-05 16:44:32 Stocks are not a direct correlation with how employment is doing. The reason why they are doing poor right now because they budget deficit is increasing and loans are a lot more risky right now bc of the tax cuts.
2021 2019-01-05 16:44:31 Pot stocks are penny stocks at the moment. I've got 26 shares for less than $10.

Hemp was just legalized in the United States and that's where they get the majority of CBD from.

2026 2019-01-05 16:41:51 If it admits to the raw sewage maybe I will. I am infuriated by Canada’s lack of regulations on dumping sewage into the oceans. 

Victoria, BC does too. The killer whales are dying b/c of lost salmon stocks. No one talks about the sewage.
2027 2019-01-05 16:41:11 Yes, I warned my folks on the first major drop in the stock market! Moving my 401k $ out of stocks & into a stable capital fund, I explained to them why I made the move.  Ignoring my advise to consider doing the same with their stocks, I hate to tell them, I told you so!
2028 2019-01-05 16:40:26 Tip 1: In addition to knowledge of basic trading procedures, traders need to keep up on the latest stock market news and events that affect stocks. Make a wish list of stocks you'd like to trade and keep yourself informed about the selected companies and general markets.

2035 2019-01-05 16:37:55 Investments are tanking because of the Communist Federal Reserve that wants us broke. No thank you. Not playing onto that. They ruined my Disney, Krispy Kreme, and Sherwin williams stocks and 401k. Nuff on that.
2036 2019-01-05 16:37:34 If you’re interested in stocks and are willing to stay in it for the long run then buy into Sirius Minerals, guaranteed money maker 
2037 2019-01-05 16:37:24 And you can, there's nothing stopping you. 

Investing in individual stocks is a risky undertaking.  

There are plenty of mutual funds where you can dollar cost average in and do very, very well and limit your risk.

The key to any investment  is compounding, not day trading

2042 2019-01-05 16:36:26 This is uncontroversial mind imho. The real sticking point is whether we should move to a flat rate on the stock of wealth, i.e. an internal negative rate of return, tax, on stocks of wealth above a certain level 1/2
2043 2019-01-05 16:34:53 Moved everything out of stocks.

Booyah combo can be very narrow, and the roller isn’t as big a threat if the opponent knows what they’re doing.

2047 2019-01-05 16:32:59 The ultimate goal of investors should be to find the best companies they can, and hold their stocks for the long term – ten, twenty, thirty years from now, thinks Warren Buffett,
2048 2019-01-05 16:32:30 So I told her there were some people who would rather put their money with her than an investment advisor, or whatever Gerber is.

Her: But I don't know anything about stocks

Me: Yeah, but at least you admit it
2049 2019-01-05 16:31:55 Sounds to me that they should buy stocks in Kleenex then. It would curb the pink eye epidemic.
2050 2019-01-05 16:31:41 The economy should just function normally. Why create another murky arbitrage avenue
People Shop price $5

Buy from piporro shop and mop up all stocks, put them on street for $7. Ndiko kupenya manje uku.
2051 2019-01-05 16:31:19 Warren Buffett always believed in the fundamental values of a business. 

"If you're right about the business, don't bother about attempting to buy stocks based on how their stock charts have looked over the past 200 days.
2052 2019-01-05 16:30:56 If the president and the Fed chair can influence the stock market by what they say, stocks are not valued at their real worth.

2054 2019-01-05 16:30:15 It seems to be slowly recognized that a recession is in our near future. Specifically it will probably be here by late summer. As expectations can change quickly the business cycle can do the same. The stock market tends to lead. #stocks #recession #Expectations
2055 2019-01-05 16:28:37 Also 312,000 NEW JOBS last month!! Record low unemployment....just because u havent made money on your stocks doesnt mean the market isnt gaining. It has ups and downs but overall is up and our GDP is up as well. What is the issue?
2056 2019-01-05 16:28:34 Ross just wants to be on TV. Wants to be seen and heard. That's why he has a band and majored in communications not business or finance. 

He wants to be a celebrity just like Elon.

Investing other people's money in ETF's and bubble stocks is just a means to an end.

2058 2019-01-05 16:27:39 It's supposed to be one of the best stocks to invest in right now in the US - though that may change since legalization means RCT & longitudinal research on the impact of THC re. development, short- and long-term health, and safety outcomes will be more easily accessible.
2059 2019-01-05 16:27:37 Wow.  New York was in disarray in the mid eighties, and guys like these emerged. Friends in banking, stocks and finance were callig me to say, "Com'mon, they're giving money to guys like us away. Stop what you're doing and get rich!"

2065 2019-01-05 16:25:50 Sir, since long you have stopped posting your scans. They were helpful in shortlisting the stocks for trade and made life simpler for me. Can we expect this in future. Thanks.
2066 2019-01-05 16:25:33 The people in MA, CT, & VT are ignoring the ban on bump stocks. Millions more, including police officers, are ignoring the "high capacity" magazine ban in NJ. People will not comply with gun control laws, so now what?
2067 2019-01-05 16:25:10 That’s not the primary case. Long-term capital gains affect everyone with investments in stocks and mutual funds (roughly half the US). The market and startup economy did fine when they were taxed at the same rate as income, until 2000.
2068 2019-01-05 16:24:35 I'm gonna record the 3 stocks now
2069 2019-01-05 16:23:59 Cause bulls are too busy filing for bankruptcy from all the down days. Or maybe they've given up on trading stocks.

2073 2019-01-05 16:22:49 There are many countries that would be happy to have thier tax revenue. Also they pay taxes and are not a drain. That extra money they make they invest in stocks, companies, and business ventures. Tax them and that will all stop.
2074 2019-01-05 16:22:17 That’s brilliant and respect for actually declaring (many don’t!)

Pay tax on income, rental property & stamp duty for buying FTSE stocks - I’ll avoid paying anymore than I have to because god forbid shit hits the fan government ain’t helping me with anything, sad reality.
2075 2019-01-05 16:20:09 Never let a peach/daisy take you to castle seige.  I just saved you 3 stocks of never touching the ground. You're welcome.
2076 2019-01-05 16:18:07 I’ve noticed you haven’t posted a story about trump confiscating bump stocks.
2077 2019-01-05 16:17:54 THIS IS SO GREAT AND NEEDED, but why do you think they didn’t include lobbyist limiting in this. 

Maybe bc that’s how Dems take in corporate $, & god forbid we stop ALL major conflicts of interest such as lobbyist influence donations and purchasing & profiting from stocks.
2078 2019-01-05 16:17:18 People who give homie stocks won’t last the winter.
2079 2019-01-05 16:17:11 $NAV 21.50 and eventually 17 area in 2019. Just a matter of when. possible buy out at this levels. Low PE stocks tend to be Cyclical biz. $F

2088 2019-01-05 16:11:09 Rich people will make their money in other ways,  high top rates will cause growth of smaller companies to fill slack left by bigger ones shrinking.

2108 2019-01-05 15:58:18 I'm long numerous mj stocks and after reading all the short reports and rebuttals I have zero doubt that APHA did not act in the best interest of shareholders and I believe an SEC investigation is inevitable if not already in progress.The Execs n related parties should be ashamed
2109 2019-01-05 15:57:56 Focus on investing, global news can impact stocks. Why are they fighting? I had some bad experiences with the French but not all are this way. There are many good people in the world, including U.S. We have great kids, teens, and young adults who care about others. Peace

2117 2019-01-05 15:52:38 Supply and demand will decide where this industry goes and how well stocks do. There will obviously be some winners but finding the right one may be tough.
2118 2019-01-05 15:52:35 We need gun control. BAN the sales of bump stocks, background checks for everyone. If you have a history of mental illness they need to require a series of evaluations before that person can be around a gun. Require safety classes and background checks every 6 months
2119 2019-01-05 15:52:09 If the Fed keeps us in the zone, we'll be fine. Pause hikes + continue QT while inflation under 2% and stocks creeping higher and we're all happy. Nobody is asking for 20% market returns, just stability and 5% YoY gains would be nice. The Fed has to keep assets stable, not bubble
2120 2019-01-05 15:51:46 Your right Michael, in the early days I was glued to the financial news, pre Internet, reading all papers at the library, watching Lou Rukeyser, Squawk Box, NBR, and while good, it at times had conflicting news. Then you listen to what you want to hear.

2121 2019-01-05 15:50:33 Our house is down as well.  Stocks are down, stock options have disappeared and jobs are disappearing.  We did not want to retire when we are now.
2122 2019-01-05 15:48:48 One can rent a family as well, there.
2123 2019-01-05 15:48:31 Yes.  The Warren CFPB & Obama economy are still steaming along.  But it’ll crash if Donny Piss Pants remains in power much longer.  

Wealth doesn’t create jobs. Fair laws & actual small business does.  The Uber wealthy hide & horde money.  Stocks go up when employment goes down.
2124 2019-01-05 15:47:28 Republicans create deficits by giving more money to rich people, which doesn't stimulate the economy because they just buy stocks or hide it offshore.
2125 2019-01-05 15:47:20 That's how you grow the economy, per capita as well ;)
Further downstream businesses can flourish too:

1. Uber/aggregator portals can be floated showing best GF/BF
2.  Credit rating agencies can rate them and find some earnings traction

Overall prosperity!

2127 2019-01-05 15:46:27 People like him that encourage the sales of bump stocks are idioc. I hope someone stops him before it is too late. They kill me with the southern thing, I doubt they could survive in the real country for a night lol.

2129 2019-01-05 15:43:52 I think Alon would do stocks/flows as a dynamical system anyway? The concept of difference isn’t really the core part of calculus, IMO
2130 2019-01-05 15:43:39 don't understand why stocks markets are not open 24/7...
2131 2019-01-05 15:43:14 Speak for yourself . I'm an average American, and his tax cuts was a good thing. My stocks are also doing great, even with the fluctuation in the market. Screw the obstructionist Dems. Build the wall.
2132 2019-01-05 15:43:11 I like to put it this way:

If you owe someone money but decide to invest the money you have into stocks instead of paying back the debt that is owed, you're really investing on margin.
2133 2019-01-05 15:42:16 "Some Business news" aka Establishment News that paints a picture of a great economy because of the Stock Market when they know almost all stocks are owned by Top 10%

2138 2019-01-05 15:39:42 Best advice.
Stop investing directly in stocks.
But mutual funds or Nifty index fund.
2139 2019-01-05 15:39:08 Would be able to see some true unseen value there :)
2140 2019-01-05 15:39:03 Which one sirji? There are so many amazing dialogues in 3 Idiots.. Just love that movie..
2141 2019-01-05 15:38:41 Great job! I managed 5.8% with many of the same stocks, they are all up 5-18% each with position sizes from 10-25%. To make 27% I would have needed sizes of around 50-100%. So, I'm very curious about how much you carried in each position.
2142 2019-01-05 15:37:44 25 yrs old.
Invested for the first time in 2018.
For the first 2 months it was live heaven.
I thought making money is so easy.
After 2 months markets crashed and kept on crashing for months!
But still I think God to teaching me early in life that there's no quick money in stocks
2143 2019-01-05 15:37:26 Gotta look at them stocks and make some frickin money with that Pear Phone.
But wait, isn’t calling the Pear Phone a Pear Phone the equivalent to calling an iPhone an APPLE PHONE?
2144 2019-01-05 15:37:09 Maybe you should stick to commentating on stocks and shares.
2145 2019-01-05 15:37:07 I agree all you say , but I prefer to invest in other stocks right now , I wouldn’t mind to buy again $AMRN later .
2146 2019-01-05 15:36:51 Kind of like how the NFL Draft Combine workouts can only really hurt a player; either with deflated draft stocks from poor 1-day performance or inflated expectations off of 1 day of great non-football activities.

Indian Rupee likely to appreciate further next week.
IT stocks are not likely to do well.
But premiums are high ahead of results.

I plan the following strategy.
1. Buy 1X2000CE.
2. Sell 3X2100CE.

2160 2019-01-05 15:30:06 You're excused though I'm not sure what your excuse is other than feigned ignorance. Surely you are not basing your investments on the weekly market? Stocks have increased exponentially since Trump's inauguration and increased 700 pts. yesterday despite the partial shutdown.
2161 2019-01-05 15:30:00 Do u think a son of a peasant like me, can invest in Apple stocks? I am also curious to know if it is Halal or not....

2164 2019-01-05 15:27:34 Stupidity and greed are incurable though, it would seem. 
Might help if none of us bought tinned tuna though? Lower the demand for it and let stocks recover.
2165 2019-01-05 15:27:18 Massey, we elected Trump he is our president. We are better off. Jobs and wages up in Detroit. Illegal immigration down. Bump stocks illegal.

2173 2019-01-05 15:22:01 Stocks went up like crazy Friday.  I hope you bought on Thursday like I did. 
2174 2019-01-05 15:20:54 That's how you play these OTC penny stocks!

2182 2019-01-05 15:19:01 The art trade doesn't rely on raping the ocean for profit, an ocean that is the life support system of our planet. Some blue fin tuna stocks are recovering, but from an incredibly low level. Let them fully recover then harvest them sustainably.
2183 2019-01-05 15:18:51 People that enter the OTC, see stocks making huge gains, and want the same thing, but don't understand what their up against. 
Is why 99% of OTC tickers are junk... CEOs and associated conglomerates know how easy it is to fleece these people who want to get rich over night.

2185 2019-01-05 15:17:50 I read that a birkin bag is a better investment than gold or stocks. I told AT this and he says “when we actually have better cash flow and not so much debt (buying a building is expensive), you can have a birkin bag. Until then I’m buying stocks”

Of course at his age, there’s loads of time.  But it’s an interesting exercise which got us reviewing our PF yet again!

We’ve emphasised timing is key.
2190 2019-01-05 15:13:40 Yeah, on the surface that sounds shitty, however the government actually rewarded businesses for expanding and hiring more people (employers would hire people........THEN GET TAX CUTS)

Now they get tax cuts and just buy back their own stocks to artificially inflate their worth.
2191 2019-01-05 15:13:23 I had a friend who once worked  in a brokerage selling bonds & stocks. The cold calling was done in an open room and they could hear each other talk. He told me all of the 6 figure earners were the biggest liars in the room. Some of our NJ pols were in that business! Guess who?
2192 2019-01-05 15:13:03 Britons still use 16th century finance terms. A stock is a government bond according to UK test material. But at banks even in the UK they use the American English terms: stocks are equities and government bonds are treasuries for the US and govies for everyone else.

2195 2019-01-05 15:12:53 Most shareholders act passively, through the buying & selling of stocks & shares, rather than active participation, many don't even pay attention to the executive pay structure. Their interest is in share performance & most holders couldn't care less about wages of serfs vs CEO

2200 2019-01-05 15:09:47 The secret to "dipping in" is to let the stocks be your barometer. If things continue to move up and work, I'll add to them, trail my stops, and initiate new positions.  If things start rolling over and breadth turns ugly again, then I just "dip out".

2205 2019-01-05 15:01:08 One thing I have learned recently is the importance of individual bonds over bond funds.  With this knowledge I now see how much of the community is missing out for their fixed income portion of their money.  It’s all stocks with bonds as an after thought.

2212 2019-01-05 14:56:13 With women more prominent in Congress, one of the male senators said, we may get beyond stocks & weapons, & on to pre-K for all, education in general.  It is proven, proven, proven.  Equalizer, at least if home culture is equalized.  That is proven too.  Mom's vocabulary matters.
2213 2019-01-05 14:56:10 Patience is an investors worst enemy, at least I know it’s true for me. Pick good strong stocks that will last in your portfolio or buy the index. Then every month/qtr invest the same $ amount and reinvest dividends. Wait 30 years and done.

2217 2019-01-05 14:54:23 The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.2% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. (The S&P 500 and Dow were down slightly in 2015, but the Nasdaq was higher that year.)

2221 2019-01-05 14:50:18 He’s right. People tend to sell and buy at the wrong time based upon emotion. I’m 7.6% in cash, focusing on safety and high dividend with free cash flow, stocks and taking some profits.
2222 2019-01-05 14:49:31 Very true... some institutional money won't touch stocks below $5.
My guess is that is what the plan is with BYOC, nothing less than $5 after RS.

2260 2019-01-05 14:19:19 If you knew anything about stocks you’d know there are always corrections. The Fed rate hike was a big impact to the recent negative growth. Yesterday Fed says they are not looking to rate hike again soon and the market boomed.

2269 2019-01-05 14:11:57 Thanks. I now own zero stocks, and expecting another 2000 / 2007 crash at any time.
2270 2019-01-05 14:11:24 But i want to put stocks charts too, it's possible? Thanks
2271 2019-01-05 14:11:20 I met both of y’all about 10 years ago at a stocks-for-tots event. By far the nicest people I’ve met in years of being around racing.
2272 2019-01-05 14:09:57 Libre kita yung ketsup nila madami akong stocks HAHAHAHAH
2273 2019-01-05 14:09:54 I trace much of this back to the dot com boom in the 90s when stocks were splitting three times a year and traditional business had to start focusing on tomorrow’s stock price and not healthy growth /end
2274 2019-01-05 14:09:46 Buy popcorn and soda stocks, this is going to be entertaining.

2276 2019-01-05 14:07:32 So many sheeple follow the insanely bear biased financial media.  The US economy will be fine earnings will grow 6-10 percent on top of stimulus fueled 2018 numbers.  Trade war will end and stocks will deliver returns in line with earnings growth.  Selectively place your bets.
2277 2019-01-05 14:07:29 Not affected 
2278 2019-01-05 14:06:44 Je vous rejoins toutefois sur les conditions d'extraction des stocks actuels où on ferme tout de même pas mal les yeux. Bref, pour une éolienne donc, il reste le soucis de toute l'électronique de pilotage avec ses matériaux / de la tech choisie pour le parc installé / à venir
2279 2019-01-05 14:05:31 The tariffs on China are really putting a lot of pressure on some technology stocks. Apple has a lot of exposure. It is in everybody's interest to resolve this trade war. In the longer term it will get resolved one way or another. In the short term Apple is a bargain.
2280 2019-01-05 14:05:12 Dry January starts when the stocks run out.
2281 2019-01-05 14:04:54 Yes but then you would surely have seen a steepening of the world curve. Instead it flattened...and stocks still liked it. Which is a bit counterintuitive.
2282 2019-01-05 14:04:20 Bansal ji tell 3-4 stocks like itc which can be bought  for next 10 yrs

2284 2019-01-05 14:02:52 I dont know why anyone is still with Fascistbook, zuck's stocks are dropping like lead because hes been caught out and the same will happen to jack, thats the only way they will wake up to their censorship and discrimination is when their wallets take a hit!
2285 2019-01-05 14:02:06 With little cash to invest in stocks,reduce the diversification risk:by investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your overall investment.

2292 2019-01-05 13:57:11 TOTD: Buy the stocks who have been dragged down by the decline in index. 
- The market rose, because of our beloved powell. This could mean the market will ease up for a short periode, which means increase in stock prices! So find the healthy stocks, because they will go up.
2293 2019-01-05 13:56:52 Went to 5 restaurants just to find crab soup. Usual place close for renovation and out of stocks. So I call everyone.

2299 2019-01-05 13:50:26 Why only Tech stocks would not last? because tech evolves? Many industrial companies must evolve due to tech as well and some succeed to thrive and some other died... like any other companies in any sector.
2300 2019-01-05 13:49:33 Can also trade stocks based on insider information.   It is a kleptocracy designed to enrich members.   Needs to change.

2309 2019-01-05 13:47:03 The gun nut apparently doesn't understand the distinction between cyclic rate of fire and effective rate of fire. Bump stocks absolutely increase the effective rate of fire. Gun nuts like to pretend they are smart about guns. Really they play idiotic semantic games.
2310 2019-01-05 13:46:43 It's like tether for stocks.  You have to trust they have the shares they claim...
2311 2019-01-05 13:45:53 But we're not talking about stocks or mutual funds are we?

2316 2019-01-05 13:44:01 This week in crypto:

1. Overstock using BTC to pay taxes
2. Consensys & AMD build cloud computing
3. DX Exchange launching tokenized stocks
4. Thai government digitizing voting onchain
5. Bakkt raised $182 million
6. Fortnite store accepts Monero

No one can stop the progress!
2317 2019-01-05 13:42:34 Stocks been going crazy lately
2318 2019-01-05 13:40:51 Did buy and will buy more cylcical stocks on Monday .. possibility of a decent correction upwards for a change .. ie. not just a 1-2 day rally ...
2319 2019-01-05 13:40:49 Recent $EWZ $JNK move confuses me.
Some small cap and oil stock move were not bad too.
Thare are not mid bigcap breakout stocks, but $RZV momentum might come back with BB.

2322 2019-01-05 13:37:45 Fantastic work last night by @ActorPaulMarlon and @JackH1985 . They absolutely smashed it at @actorawareness working class story season. Don’t miss the performance of TRUE COLOURS this evening! I loved it! Raw, funny and touching. GO SEE TONIGHT! 
@Tom_Stocks
2323 2019-01-05 13:37:44 I can tell youb100% for sure that absolutely none... NONE of that rally in stocks yesterday was about the trade war; NONE

So these articles you see mentioning it as a reason for the rally are worthless political propaganda or ignorant reporters that write what they're told.
2324 2019-01-05 13:36:52 Based on this I must be worth...

2326 2019-01-05 13:36:12 Ur bio about seeking knowledge even if it's at China is said by muhammed (pbuh). You don't even have the audacity to quote who mentioned it. I've removed my investment in stocks . It isn't much. urging people to do the same
2327 2019-01-05 13:36:02 Made mistake of reading some narratives of last week’s market. Apparently what’s good for stocks is painfully anemic growth (let’s bring back Obama) coupled with continued subzero real rates set by the Fed.
2328 2019-01-05 13:35:41 Yeah, but so are many other stocks.
2329 2019-01-05 13:34:21 Agreed . But midfield is horrendous.  Fred reminds me of djemba djemba.  Mac toss face he wouldn't get in stocks 3rd team with the likes Reagan the cat and joe Kirkpatrick

2333 2019-01-05 13:30:33 I tried to teach my ex about stocks and investing but  hey everyone don’t wanna gain
2334 2019-01-05 13:30:32 Am I wrong or are people delusional from having been spoiled by Utopian-like stock returns for 10 yrs. Stocks go down 5% last year (first decline in 10yrs) and everyone lashes out like it's the GFC
2335 2019-01-05 13:30:22 @PRSundar64 Can u suggest me few stocks for long term accumulation as SIP.

2336 2019-01-05 13:30:19 I’ve been doing 10% plus a rack a month for my daughter. By time she 18 she will have at least $18,000. That’s outside of stocks and investments.
2337 2019-01-05 13:28:57 I'd love to be mentored on stocks/investment. That would be a brilliant  type of knowledge to gain. Of course, I'd be doing my own studying, too. I enjoy this kind of stuff so much.

Moi perso j'ai reçu un mail de confirmation, puis un second mail pour me dire qu'ils avaient tous les produits en stocks et que du coup elle partait tout de suite ! Peut être que tt est pas encore en stock et du coup -
2339 2019-01-05 13:26:49 You are funny.  There is no winning in my house.  Stocks down, losses of over $200,000, husband furloughs, and a criminal president sitting in our WH.  How is that winning?
2340 2019-01-05 13:25:52 This is probably an open ended question, but when first trying to form a strategy what do you look for? I've been picking out 1 specific fact from stocks i.e it gapped 100%, and then trying to track everything it does after that, just can't seem to connect the dots, if you get me
2341 2019-01-05 13:25:20 can we start a petition for Piers Morgan to be put in stocks and pelted with vegan sausage rolls for red nose day/children in need?

2343 2019-01-05 13:20:40 I enjoyed the markets, both oil and stocks, yesterday for the first time in months.  Then I remembered i recovered roughly 1/8th amount of what I lost.  Good enough economic news that it oil survived an awful Cushing report.  I would be embarrassed if I put out “expert” estimates

2367 2019-01-05 13:05:38 Reading about the Stocks and Shares. I never quite understand why 'the market panics'. A large part of the well-being of the economy seems to come down to psychology. Has the market tried 'not panicking'?

2391 2019-01-05 12:45:53 What lies? I have lived through both the era. Yes, employment is at the lowest but it is the result of an ongoing trend which was put well on the road by Obama's efforts. Stocks reflect the economic outlook. NK is back to square one. It is threatening to start producing missiles.
2392 2019-01-05 12:43:23 You keep believing those lies. Unemployment is the lowest it's been in over 50 years. Stocks don't control our economy, did you miss the manufacturing and labor #'s that came out yesterday. Turn off the fake news and try to think for yourself..NK stopped the missiles goofy.
2393 2019-01-05 12:37:15 Thanks. My intrigue is the gap closures fyi. Been a reoccuring thing I've seen in a lot of stocks lately. Both downside and upside gaps (mostly downside lately though). Cheers.

2395 2019-01-05 12:36:11 @reneritchie @DanielEran  Why must one be subjected to this mindless clickbait business porn with the iPhone stocks app. Why can’t I have freedom from this porn shite. Steve Jobs would be all over these stupid faked Forbes bait articles. Tim Cook needs to pull his thumb out!! 
2396 2019-01-05 12:36:02 amen, sadly i think we will get another year of this current attitude due to the stocks as they will want quick money,
but i think there will be a bounce back because the ones that do well will be those that dont go for the quick buck and publishers will hopefully see that

2399 2019-01-05 12:30:41 Unemployment rates are falling at the same rate as they were under Obama. NK is more likely to launch missiles now than they ever were in past several decades. What religious freedoms? Many non-Christians are cowering. Economy, same as under Obama + Stocks have tanked.

2417 2019-01-05 12:14:41 Well, the more money you have, the more money you can get for doing nothing. You invest money, & as long as your stocks don't tank, you get a return on that money. That's free money. That billion is not just sitting there -- it's earning money for you. It's absolutely wild .

2420 2019-01-05 12:12:08 They push for the little things first. It is progression. Ban magazines and bump stocks, then other scary accessories “for the children”. Eventually they get the semiautomatics ban, then revolvers.

2432 2019-01-05 11:57:47 Cramer is the last person you should listen to imo. I started trading in 2008. Not the best year to start trading. But I survived. He bashed stocks that did well and pumped the ones in his charitable trust. There is a vid of him saying manipulating stocks is fun and worthwhile.
2433 2019-01-05 11:55:45 "Experts warn that the fish is facing potential extinction, with stocks of Pacific bluefin having dropped 96 percent from their pre-industrial levels" is a better headline.

It’s in the individual stocks.

As a young trader, it’s interesting to watch everything unfold.

If your system of screening stocks allow more than 1-2 stocks, per year, to buy at current valuations, u should recheck it. 

In times of big market corrections, your screener will hit u with 30-40 stocks & u wouldn't KNOW what to avoid!!

Too much time is spent on FINDING new stocks. 

Too LITTLE time spent on allocation and building up big positions on existing stocks. 

U need just 5-10 stocks for 5-10 years with sizable positions.
2470 2019-01-05 11:23:15 Also some stocks pay dividends which is a payment you get for owning the shares, most often quarterly, and you can usually sign up to have that reinvested and then your holdings grow faster. Most of the time it’s nothing huge, but it’s a bonus.

2490 2019-01-05 11:07:35 For rich people, straight income from wages is a fraction of the money they make in a year. Once you account for stocks, options, investments, etc, that 70% marginal (not total) becomes close to probably 30% of what they actually made in a year. You're not a very good economist.

2518 2019-01-05 10:40:30 But listen to the asymmetry in those statements. Market is every bit as bad as Greenspan & Co.
Yes, stocks boosted beyond norms in relation to the economy during #QE #ZIRP: ergo current decline does NOT necessarily imply recession, but a restoration of sanity, as #Powell implies.

2533 2019-01-05 10:21:31 Tough call to answer that question. I do believe that keeper stocks are up right across the board this year. Galekovic, Thomas, Young. Even Reddy is having a good season. Maybe we’re just seeing general improvements.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2534 2019-01-05 10:21:23 What is your definition of “operated”? If we are going to label stocks and their movements depending on whether an entity holds 10%/ two-three entities hold 20%, lots of high quality cos will be labelled.

2536 2019-01-05 10:18:52 As such, Nigeria must limit its current uptake of the Block 2 variant to six units which would give us multirole service while ramping up stocks of the upcoming Block 3 which would be a formidable air superiority asset
2537 2019-01-05 10:16:50 Tides launders money for anyone. Own a lot of railway stocks? A couple million to block pipelines is a great ROI. Want to de-stabilize Canada, nudge Alberta out of Confederation? It's cheap and easy.
2538 2019-01-05 10:16:17 The Euro can not survive. The whole of Europe are in trouble even the likes of Germany, France their debts are out of control, stocks have tumbled. They are on the verge, Portugal is the only member holding its own. Italy  Spain Cyprus Ireland etc are done for.
2539 2019-01-05 10:15:03 Well, they are seizing bump stocks already.

2543 2019-01-05 10:09:57 Also, the whole corporation buy back of stocks, was that because of QE then?
2544 2019-01-05 10:08:45 And how does lower cost of borrowing help stock prices go up (WRT QE), if not thru borrowing money to purchase stocks?
2545 2019-01-05 10:08:33 Find this hard to believe because European supermarkets stock milk in refrigerated sections. So, isn't it logical that the consumer buys it and stocks it in the fridge again at home?

2547 2019-01-05 10:06:08 Markets are expecting a hike, it is priced in which is partly why stocks have had such an awful year. If they didn't hike rates, and gave some indication that they would hold off for a period of time, I would expect a rally.
2548 2019-01-05 10:04:20 @GerberKawasaki I might dump my stocks at 2604 man. Rebuy the mega dip at 2326 s&p futures. Mega double bottom off the weekly 200sma. And 2 monthly supports. I can dig that. Double capitulation. Restart bull market with low oil and recovering China after trade deal.
2549 2019-01-05 10:03:16 these are not quality stocks
2550 2019-01-05 10:01:06 I see. Moving along, how much are you personally suffering? Stocks took a little dip and came right back, and jobless numbers are way down. What’s your affliction? Are the Communists razing your house to make way for the next Olympics? They do that. #gop #tcot
2551 2019-01-05 10:00:10 I think signaling effect is basically:”oh the cb has got out backs and is pulling stops out to support econ, so now lets invest/hire/buy/consume” is the mechanism- rather than “lets borrow money to buy stocks” which I dont think is an actual thing

Further qs if u don't mind:

Signaling effect?
Who's doing most of the borrowing to purchase stocks
2555 2019-01-05 09:54:39 Mini stocks race three.
2556 2019-01-05 09:52:58 Afaik: 

QE -> signaling effect -> confidence -> stocks up 

QE -> term prem compression -> cost of borrowing lower -> stocks up

QE -> fwd guidance on rates -> cost of borrowing lower -> stocks up

are the main non-quack theories, probably left some other ones out bec early

2558 2019-01-05 09:52:34 You are right but they can stop #QT and lower rates again which will inject more liquidity into the system and boost stocks later this year
2559 2019-01-05 09:51:55 Stocks have some appeal...
2560 2019-01-05 09:51:20 You only take credit when the stocks are going up. It was a matter of time before you started planning blame on failure.
2561 2019-01-05 09:51:19 Agree Stewie. #Fed created all these bubbles that mis-allocated capital everywhere and eventually they will need to go back to more #QE and stop #QT to keep things from imploding. I think in 2019 that means the market will be pretty choppy but once they relent stocks go up.

2568 2019-01-05 09:44:22 You are no better than psycho Colleen, who only endorses what you want to hear.  Real facts?  No.

Stocks go down: Blame Libs.
Stocks up: All credit to Trump.
How delusional and batshit crazy is that -- you take no responsibility for your wrong judgements.

2611 2019-01-05 09:06:03 US stocks drop on Powell remarks. Then US stocks rally on Powell remarks (pretty much for saying the opposite). Conclusion: Powell should learn to shut the f*ck up.
2612 2019-01-05 09:05:27 Last year I finished 91st with a 0.18% profit, which was a lot better than my real life result (-7.5%). Buy and hold a few stocks can work out better, but is not as much fun.Currently at 226.
2613 2019-01-05 09:03:44 Interesting, thanks for all this, I thought things were actually much better over there, like defaulting to 3-5% when locking money up in something relatively secure for 3-5 years.

People can invest in stocks here without being accr. yes, but it's only local, awful stocks IIRC.

2617 2019-01-05 08:59:54 Ok. Those stats are meaningless.. But there are many stocks that are grossly undervalued. $AAPL, $NVDA, $MSFT among the big companies for example...
2618 2019-01-05 08:58:31 ETFs are too boring. I Need the Kick of Stock-Trading. And only with Stocks are huge Profits in Short Time possible. With ETFs you will never get rich but with Stocks is it possible.
2619 2019-01-05 08:55:59 Most of the A group stocks getting adjusted towards lower bands.  This may continue of few more quarters. Swing traders with short positions shall continue to do well  in this kind of scenario
2620 2019-01-05 08:53:48 And that's what System Trading is All About! Finding Past Biases, Relation of Certain Number or tool with past Behavior of Security, Hoping that it will Repeat in Future.

2627 2019-01-05 08:44:05 Usually a stock bounces off the 200DMA a few times before it sinks....watching these few stocks could give us a clue if we have any further downside. If they remain resilient we shouldn't be too bearish.

2629 2019-01-05 08:42:53 We have a Big Sale on Giro helmets and shoes. Save big money on both road and MTB, including the Giro Riddance shoes and Montaro Helmet plus many many others. 
Whilst Stocks last.....
2630 2019-01-05 08:42:52 Volatile doesn't mean down, it's been going up and down. There's big selloffs and people come in and swoop up stocks at a lower price and it goes back up.
2631 2019-01-05 08:42:22 Wait...there's no way to buy index funds or similar? Only accredited investors can buy stocks of any kind?!?
2632 2019-01-05 08:41:34 I really wanna invest in stocks but I’m afraid to lose all my money from the past 6 months
2633 2019-01-05 08:40:53 I BEEN GETTIN DIRTY MONEY JORDAN BELFORT STACKIN PENNY STOCKS WHILE IM FLIPPING THESE BIRDSSSSS

2635 2019-01-05 08:38:46 Be grateful all the time. Let's persevere and keep going. No efforts are ever wasted knowing they replenish the stocks after it went sold-out. They are observing. Tweet and chill. And avail yours! :)

Oui c'est ce qui c est pas avec l argent de l empire espagnol
Mais regarde les diamants
En fait c'est pas SI rare que ça c'est juste que les gens qui possèdent les stocks n en relâchent que peux à la fois sur le marché pour pas le devaluer
2637 2019-01-05 08:36:46 I'm very interested to invest. In which stocks are you investing in?
2638 2019-01-05 08:34:28 Could also learn stocks or other ways to make money
2639 2019-01-05 08:32:32 Well there goes all those sales they had as a result of her being created

It's only a matter of time before all their stocks go down the shitter
2640 2019-01-05 08:32:09 Agree, Strategy matter the most here, it keeps you on cash when stocks not moving even if it's a good stock!

However, a good stock never need any strategy but knowing or identifying many good stocks in advance, that too in an early stage is close to impossible.

2644 2019-01-05 08:25:59 Seems they may be shorting a lot of stocks too
2645 2019-01-05 08:25:22 Agree. Compare peek of 07 where it broke to peak of 18 on 1st crack. In 07 stocks were overvalued also at a fraction today's level. Housing, autos, GDP, mortgage rates, int rates, inflation and savings all much higher levels than new. Debt much lower. Pension better funded.
2646 2019-01-05 08:23:59 How are the stocks
2647 2019-01-05 08:21:52 My stocks increased $60,000, thank you @POTUS!
2648 2019-01-05 08:21:51 They also frequently provide sound financial planning in short term stocks and bonds.
2649 2019-01-05 08:19:52 Somebody somewhere obviously has reassuring data about fish stocks over there, because they keep fishing and fishing - what is  the truth ?
2650 2019-01-05 08:18:44 Yep. Gary has had a pretty modest 2018. 10 matches, 49 wickets at 34. Not earth shattering. Time to experiment with the bowling stocks IMO.
2651 2019-01-05 08:18:41 Just don't forget to turn in your bump stocks you traitors....hehe.
2652 2019-01-05 08:17:55 Trump took your bump stocks..lol.  Don't forget to turn them in traitors. #RussiaLovingTraitors

2655 2019-01-05 08:15:55 Most sould have done this a week ago - buying stocks takes a risk taker - If you took the risk then tonight you are seeing great rewards. Stocks drops take a caculated but educated risk and buy with the understanding that stocks will rise and you will profit
2656 2019-01-05 08:15:37 I honestly do not care about businesses & stocks, what I am interested in so far only human values. Staying low to the ground, social strictures businesses build.

Choose your stocks wisely, good strategy only will be helpful when your stocks move n offer good risk reward.

2659 2019-01-05 08:12:36 What a bad piece of journalism! Coal stocks were never the problem. It’s common knowledge that Eskom paid ANC/Guptas premium price for coal yet delivered low grade coal that caused irreparable damage to turbines. Combine that with lack of maintenance = the real problem.
2660 2019-01-05 08:11:34 It's never stopped them before. Just like bump stocks.
2661 2019-01-05 08:11:24 Those stocks are already priced to perfection. They all in Chemicals space ;)

2670 2019-01-05 08:00:56 It matters for their share price as we just saw with apple stocks lowering dramatically after they missed targets. Obv nintendo isnt on apple scale but still important - 20m is def challenging target - id expect a strong direct before end of fin year to try n make the target
2671 2019-01-05 08:00:51 since my dad has ah horrible past performance in stocks..
2672 2019-01-06 23:58:25 Stocks are so interesting.
2673 2019-01-06 23:55:07 Well since bumps stocks allow a shooter to turn their gun from semi auto to basically automatic by increasing firing rate, not being able to have them would then lessen the carnage. There’s plenty of data on that but I’m sure your opinion will negate that.
2674 2019-01-06 23:54:23 Keep buying onto stocks that will fall short on earnings. LOL!
2675 2019-01-06 23:53:41 Soon you will turn it from steel to cardboard I hope not, lol them illegals can use magnets  to go up and down the wall, I’ll go buy stocks on magnets
2676 2019-01-06 23:52:31 You can only tax income, but not the accumulated and appreciated value of his stocks (which he held for a long time, goes up and down, mostly up), unless he sells it, for capital gain.  His salary in 2017 is $81,870.  So there. Please know your facts and finance.
2677 2019-01-06 23:51:44 What stocks you liking this year??
2678 2019-01-06 23:51:33 He was likely mandated long only forever...therefore own stocks...forever...

2681 2019-01-06 23:47:36 On that basis its likely to turn, however its always less aggravating to wait for the market to give the green light, even if it means at a higher entry price. If #Gold moves back to $1,350 it should lift all Gold stocks at the end of the day. $PRU
2682 2019-01-06 23:47:16 I vote for a public flogging... put him in stocks and we can pay him back
2683 2019-01-06 23:47:04 The facts are that the stock market is much higher now than when Donald took charge. He’s been absolutely phenomenal on the economy. Jobs wages stocks etc etc
2684 2019-01-06 23:45:34 Heck why not consult kids before making any big life decisions? New job? Ask the kids. Buying a house? Ask the kids. Purchasing stocks? Ask the kids. Or maybe we don’t ask them....because they’re kids!

2686 2019-01-06 23:41:19 sounds like some hedge funds are looking for suckers to dump stocks on!
2687 2019-01-06 23:37:16 And #TraitorTrump doesn’t need the salary he gets from taxpayers. Many, many of the working poor, working class & middle class live paycheck to paycheck and don’t have the luxury of living off a trust fund, a hedge fund, stocks or even a simple savings account.
2688 2019-01-06 23:36:54 stocks of the two biggest private prison operators -- CoreCivic (formerly know as Corrections Corp. of America) and Geo Group -- have doubled since election day. CoreCivic (CXW) is up 140% since Trump won in November; Geo Group (GEO) has risen 98%.Feb 2017...#govermentshutdown
2689 2019-01-06 23:36:42 did both of them tickle your feet in the stocks at the same time!?!? :P
2690 2019-01-06 23:34:06 US Steel stocks are down 45+%.  Trump is making a deal here to use American (US Steel) made steel for these walls.  US Steel makes money, Trump gets the wall.  But what happened to the owner of Home Depot who said he would provide materials for the wall?  Did he bug out, too?
2691 2019-01-06 23:34:01 Absolutely not, and he passed the law banning bump stocks and just signed the First Step on prison reform. I truly believe he’s trying to help everyone be safer and be treated equally. He isn’t perfect, no one is, but he has done good things for this country.

2714 2019-01-06 23:31:24 started to feel that way too (that stocks are getting cheaper).
2715 2019-01-06 23:28:36 netflix stocks are down as more people cancel there services
2716 2019-01-06 23:28:10 I just had the former CEO of a $250 billion asset management company just tell me it was a shame that I am in cash. Stocks are now cheaper. Shiller P/E is 28--2x the historic norm. 20 other metrics say the same.
2717 2019-01-06 23:27:58 Yes I did .. But our tone doesn’t change the way Hedge funds short Penny stocks in USA .. Most of time the short call comes from Shorting Alpha or Mythly fool . ;) Waiting for the correction following ...
2718 2019-01-06 23:26:40 What's the matter Jacob? Stocks tumbling costing mommy and daddy some or all of you inheritance? Good! Losing money should wisen you up to the real threat that Trump is to ALL citizens, including his base. 
2719 2019-01-06 23:25:39 Our retirement funds & other stocks are doing better as well. Dividend checks bigger.
Health costs better, no penalties! Freedom of choice returned, TY Trump!

2730 2019-01-06 23:17:24 Amazing - Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi, has his 2019 target for the S&P 500 at 2,850 He also believes its a good time to jump back into the market, because stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuation.

2735 2019-01-06 23:13:47 Stocks have been slowly declining over the last few months as EU suppliers have been giving priority to the new customers they have found to replace the UK.
2736 2019-01-06 23:13:16 We have that.  Its called "small business" which produces over 50% of all jobs. Stocks that any person can invest in if they choose to save or invest.

2755 2019-01-06 22:55:53 You may have put the stream set on without it but someone definitely changed it after to underdog boost being on. Nothing else explains why M2Ks fthrow does 20.5% when 2 stocks down while everyone elses does 15.1%

When we turn underdog boost on, THATS when we get 20.5% like M2K
2756 2019-01-06 22:55:41 i know lol, i know sone people that would be over the moon with a 15% in stocks
2757 2019-01-06 22:55:18 Woahhhh PX stocks from 2.3 to 3.8 wew 
2758 2019-01-06 22:54:42 Goodness.  We are going in the wrong direction.  People not working.  Stocks tanking. Our allies hate us but dictators love us.

2760 2019-01-06 22:52:45 wow 2 trillion in debt is the right direction shame on all of you, no decent healthcare and low paying jobs most Americans don't own stocks.
2761 2019-01-06 22:51:31 Completely agree. A gun for home/personal protection, or for hunting to feed yourself or your family, is completely reasonable, but no one realistically needs a fully automatic assault rifle, or a rifle that holds an absurd amount of rounds, or bump stocks, etc

2767 2019-01-06 22:46:55 one of your favorite stocks of 19 and longer?
2768 2019-01-06 22:46:39 Sp500, careful out there. Massive ups massive downs, rollercoaster continues. Cash is the best position. Short term best stocks $ed $gis $so
2769 2019-01-06 22:46:37 Also a possibility!  I always tend to think that stocks ARE moved by big players so they can profit while everyone else pays the bill.  The street and Fintwit is very bullish on $NFLX now so that warrants some caution.  Obviously trade the best setups, but it is ripe for FOMO. 
2770 2019-01-06 22:46:21 Tip of the day:

Stocks don’t move randomly, manipulators and investors don’t pump capital in small caps all the time and at the same rate! Analyse sectoral investments(volume) and you’ll see directly how these big players influence our niche.
2771 2019-01-06 22:45:32 No, that wouldn't make the stocks drop in a day or two. It would slowly go down over the course of the year. This is caused by multiple things Apple has done in the past couple of days. Switching their manufacturing to India instead of China was probably the biggest impact.
2772 2019-01-06 22:45:18 Does that mean you are “long only” and never short individual stocks or stock indices?
2773 2019-01-06 22:44:37 Guess I'll invest in steel stocks...any suggestions? Might as well make a  buck off of all those unemployed federal employees and their suffering.
2774 2019-01-06 22:44:08 At the highs in 2018 three stocks: Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon were responsible for over 70% of the S&P 500 gains. 
So how have they fared since... #fintwit
2775 2019-01-06 22:44:02 So you are claiming you have at least $100,000,000 in stocks or it is more like less than $ 9,999,999.99? lol
2776 2019-01-06 22:43:38 Shorting Tesla is a massive fools errand in my opinion. The history of illogical stock behavior is so long, I think it is much better to focus on the thousands of other stocks not defended by accounting fraud and financial hedging. 

Yes it will drop, but it is booby trapped
2777 2019-01-06 22:41:08 I made a fortune going against the stocks recommend by gerber last year.
Do yourself a favor and short $ea!. 
Thank me later.

2779 2019-01-06 22:40:08 //I love how Yahoo’s stocks never raise or fall, they just consistently stay at 0.00. Is their company even.. active?? Or like..
Idk I’m no stockbroker, so I can’t exactly say if that’s good or bad.
All I believe I know is number low = bad

2781 2019-01-06 22:39:02 Underdog boost on with 2 stocks down makes Bowser 1st forward throw do 20.5%.
2782 2019-01-06 22:35:13 8pm nag open yung excess ng WIAE. 8:30 ako nakapagsend ng order. At naubusan agad. Grabe :( @beeyotchWP Sana more stocks soon po 
2783 2019-01-06 22:35:05 That’s weird most people say the recession of the 80s was bad, the rise of .coms and tech stocks in the late 80s and early 90s created a market bubble, and that the 50s were our most prosperous decade and the golden years. Not the 80s. ESP since Reagan was pro Mexico immigration
2784 2019-01-06 22:33:47 Queue a sudden surge in steel stocks. Trump just sent out his secret message insider trading tweet to investors. #fucktrump
2785 2019-01-06 22:33:34 Stocks 
2786 2019-01-06 22:31:23 Can we check if its still on by testing moves when someone is stocks behind on stream?
2787 2019-01-06 22:31:00 I dont like how hearts on HC & some on twitter pump stocks when theyve acquired cheap only to remain silent when they begin to sell. In some cases actively pumping while selling. But to be fair, I don't think any business/person operates to the letter of the law. Yourself incl'd.
2788 2019-01-06 22:29:42 Tomorrow's The Hottest Top 10 Daily Stock Picks List have 19 STOCKS on it..yes I can count but who don't like EXTRA  email for ur copy
2789 2019-01-06 22:27:58 If it wasn't for Trump. Obama's socialist globalization agenda would have taken over & ruined America.
Now Obama's BS has been reversed, USA is doing well again. Production, wages, unemployment, stocks, gas prices etc... All better! So apparently,
Trump's tax cuts WORKED!
2790 2019-01-06 22:26:41 My father never traded, until he heard I was trading. He traded once and paid for his driveway. Before he died he shared that my grandfather traded stocks, and was a Dapper. He wore the best, while the kids needed shoes. I have shoes, I trade. 
2791 2019-01-06 22:26:30 Sir ,have u invested in penny stocks which turn   out multibagger.
2792 2019-01-06 22:23:52 Not really, businesses be buying back stocks, I’ve not seen higher wages being paid, if you have a nice source to site please do, would love to see some of that in action. Also, bad timing because of Trumps government shut down
2793 2019-01-06 22:21:51 Hahahahaha easy easy toch sis ik zag alot of heisa ook mbt Rihanna enzo. Damn son ik dacht ik licht alleen een eventuele mogelijkheid in you act like I want to steal your stocks in Tidal ofzo 
2794 2019-01-06 22:20:47  Good crypto news 

1. Overstock using BTC to pay taxes
2. Consensys & AMD build cloud computing
3. DX Exchange launching tokenized stocks
4. Thai government digitizing voting onchain
5. Bakkt raised $182 million
6. Fortnite store accepts Monero

No one can stop the progress!
2795 2019-01-06 22:20:39 I am doing it 2 stocks down, though thanks for the double check in that regard.
2796 2019-01-06 22:19:29 Well the policy says import so a lot of the plastic bags are until their stocks run out. I'm just giving them the benefit of the doubt though 
2797 2019-01-06 22:17:28 just like stocks .it is so easy to buy and sell.
2798 2019-01-06 22:17:01 Kaley, lives on Abalone Ave with 2 hermit crabs.

Put all their savings into cayenne pepper stocks. Can't retire.
2799 2019-01-06 22:15:55 I never rated Rogic at the level the media does, looks lethargic on the ball all the time and lacks creativity at the highest level. He rarely starts at in the CL against big opposition for a reason. Our stocks are poor, let hope the next generation is better
2800 2019-01-06 22:15:39 I see stocks rallied, oil fell they both caught up then descended to new lows together...I think the same now
2801 2019-01-06 22:15:21 Yeah its basically like a handicap if you're losing in stocks
2802 2019-01-06 22:15:14  right !
2803 2019-01-06 22:14:46 1

Many ways of achieving good results without massive stupidity.
 
Ban companies from buying back their own stocks.

Require companies have better employee stock ownership profit plans for non executives than executives.

Do not raise money via taxes not have money for
2804 2019-01-06 22:14:26 that's okay. wages and salaries are paid by owners to employees. owners' money come from profits (generally a % via stocks), from rents on land/patents/IP, etc - i.e. capital. there are 'rich people' whose primary income is salary, eg some top tier athletes, but they're a rarity.
2805 2019-01-06 22:14:13 Separate mechanic from Rage, but essentially a power boost if you're down in stocks/points I believe
2806 2019-01-06 22:14:00 That’s a distinct possibility! I think for me, I downplay that one because the macro environment doesn’t support it. Earnings will be fine, but reduced buyback activity, huge debt refinancing coming up, peak employment, aged bull market, and bank stocks sucking raise doubts
2807 2019-01-06 22:13:58 i dont really fault ramsey. he knew that his stocks were high and that arsenal prolly weren't going to challenge for the league title in the next few years. 

Every player dreams of winning the league. Now he will.
2808 2019-01-06 22:13:40 to be clear, I think stocks are going down, oil as well, I just think,in the short term, we see oil up and stocks down, before they have the final puke fest together, resulting in much lower than most think
2809 2019-01-06 22:13:32 LOL pure Baloney, as she's like US Citizens and we are after your cut of the corporate crime of extortion and tax fraud. You are a fascist fear monger and need a visit to the "Stocks" for public trial and suitable punishment.
2810 2019-01-06 22:13:25 Rigorous analysis I didn't conduct says to drop RLI Corp. $RLI #Stocks
2811 2019-01-06 22:12:47 CEOs are bearish biology technology stocks.
2812 2019-01-06 22:11:51 they want people buy their overvalue stocks before crash
2813 2019-01-06 22:11:47 I tested that for you, 17.5% with Underdog boost on and 2 stocks down. That itself doesn't reach that 20.5%
2814 2019-01-06 22:11:46 Similar concept. Performs much worse with stocks.
2815 2019-01-06 22:10:36 Topkek... even with all items on, in any mode, someone that's good at smash would still beat me 9 ways to sunday. there's moments of reprieve when there's no items spawning and i'd already lose 2 stocks before the smash ball drops.
2816 2019-01-06 22:08:19 You'd wake up and be like "I could make a killing on Apple stocks!" and the company tanks and folds within a year, and then google never happens.
2817 2019-01-06 22:07:59 We out here trading stocks and investing this year!
2818 2019-01-06 22:07:32 Hey @luwangnyc you mention those whose careers go back a few years.. How long have followed stocks?   have you ever invested professionally?
2819 2019-01-06 22:07:04 Idk what that means but I know another exchange where you can trade crypto and stocks only with btc
2820 2019-01-06 22:06:03 You said brother in the tweet that’s all
2821 2019-01-06 22:04:39 Go check your stocks 
2822 2019-01-06 22:03:36 Oh.. je sais pas moi aussi elle avait été accepté direct, mais le temps de mettre tout en stocks ça a prit plus de temps
2823 2019-01-06 22:03:29 double 3 stocks aussi j'étais trop énervé de ma défaite précédente allez viens te battre et ban 2 stages
2824 2019-01-06 22:03:26 trump is using his base as an excuse for building the wall. The real reason trump wants a wall is because he somehow will benefit financially from the construction of the wall. He either owns cement companies, steel companies, construction companies or stocks in all the above.
2825 2019-01-06 22:02:18 Sorry wasn't referring to crypto. Stocks :)
2826 2019-01-06 22:01:54 Kerrang! was wicked! although i don’t quite remember that  I did listen to the radio station with Matt stocks and Kate Lawler from big brother  and I did buy their weekly magazines  plus I had my bedroom covered with posters of rockstars and topless men  Xx

2831 2019-01-06 21:55:22 trump believes you don't have to worry about stocks or recession while he is the president and GOP are in control
2832 2019-01-06 21:54:37 trump believes you don't have to worry about stocks or recession while he is the president and GOP are in control
2833 2019-01-06 21:54:31 So I’ve been told.   A thousand times already lol time to take that tweet down. 
2834 2019-01-06 21:54:25 You know it's true. Highest stocks in history with the current POTUS. You'll come around one day.
2835 2019-01-06 21:52:23 @fitzstockcharts when there are many set ups (dozens) meeting your trade criteria what else do you use to determine what stocks make the esfl?

2837 2019-01-06 21:51:08 Who are these dudes wearing polos to the gym? Is that comfortable? Or are you just trying to convince me you invest in stocks?
2838 2019-01-06 21:48:11 Predictions Jan 7-11, 2019

”Bad Apples and weakness of the FAANG stocks, US Government shutdown, France rebellion: Crash wouldn't be a surprise this month.” 

S&P 500 futures
1. Down closer to 2440 $ and possibly more
2839 2019-01-06 21:47:50 The $1Trillion tax giveaway was used to buy back stocks.   We saw a run-up and now it's all gone.   So you've instead just impoverished the nation by $1T by putting all that productive money into a speculative stock market and burned it.  Sounds like terrible fiscal policy to me.
2840 2019-01-06 21:47:45 The real question is will steel stocks rebound?
2841 2019-01-06 21:45:06 You’re the one crying rn homie lmao. And yeah December was the worst month for the stocks since 1931...the year was the worst for the stocks since 2008 during the recession. Oh and 800,000 federal employees are working without pay right now. Your examples are working against you
2842 2019-01-06 21:41:09 More gains for commodities and pain for stocks in short term.
2843 2019-01-06 21:38:45 This hits especially close to home. I figure we can ride along OK for about two more weeks as-is, then I'll have to start liquidating stocks.
2844 2019-01-06 21:37:23 Deacon is not listed. Everyone plays around in stocks
2845 2019-01-06 21:36:10 Upcoming quarterlies for lithium stocks will be a turning point for some. The truth always comes out in the numbers regardless of how popular or loyal investors are to a stock.
2846 2019-01-06 21:35:58 In the months preceding 2008 crisis we saw an inverse correlation of crude oil to stocks. We have no COT data yet (ty govt shutdown) but will be interesting to see if funds are rolling into commods given discount and equity risk, if so, what this might tell #thinkingoutloudhere
2847 2019-01-06 21:35:57 O.2% (1/10th of 2%). And keep in mind it's all transactions including Wall Street, asset purchases, stocks, etc. You can almost think of it as a processing fee. Banks will automatically deduct. No IRS, no April 14th, no keeping receipts.
2848 2019-01-06 21:35:28 1: all eye's on those handful of company stocks, cause they all see the better position they'll have.
2: They'll still fall either way, US investors are getting more interested in Asian stocks.
3: there maturing the digital assets on purpose cause there is allot to gain from.
2849 2019-01-06 21:34:51 Is it about value stocks?
2850 2019-01-06 21:34:50 Fact. We could keep all of our Fish stocks. Wheat/Oats/Barley/Potatoes.Vegetables
Keep all of our own Lamb/Beef.Chicken etc.

2853 2019-01-06 21:33:34 Wages are down. Keep reading Breitbart. Corporations just gave out a little bullshit bonus to look good and then bought back stocks for their stockholders.

2856 2019-01-06 21:33:05 Federal employees, being paid or not, should call in sick. In two days the country will shut down. No TSA, no air travel, stocks will crash, banks will howl. The shutdown would end the next day and the message sent that you don’t mess with the livelihood of the bureaucracy.
2857 2019-01-06 21:32:24 .@GuitarCenter / @MusiciansFriend are the official US resellers for @BrianMayGuitars... they are sold out currently, with new stocks of the BMG Special on order... you will need to contact them for information about in-store availability.
2858 2019-01-06 21:31:22 Fingers crossed mate. I think the Mkt needed a healthy correction and now is the time to make money again by buying up cheap stocks and they are in plenty. I’m looking forward to trading the markets this year. Lots of £ to be made for all of us . Boom 
2859 2019-01-06 21:31:06 So.... what stocks would you recommend to invest in? If you will
2860 2019-01-06 21:31:01 No. Pit has legitamite mix ups and is actually very well designed, well rounded character. 

His approach tools are very limited and predictable and he def has trouble closing out stocks. Other than that he is above average in every other department.

2864 2019-01-06 21:25:49 don’t hold any stocks so don’t care about that. I care about the piece of shit entitled people we have to deal with. The whole attitude of this country was horrible under Obama. If everyone hated the US like he was making it, defied the military/LEOS, that’s very scary to me.

2866 2019-01-06 21:24:59 Shoot, its the same thing in the big boys too.. People pump stocks and then bam after hrs announce an offering. I was in one went up from 1.25 to 2.25 and 3 mins before after hrs close announced an offering for like .90
2867 2019-01-06 21:24:47 How do we define adoption? Development, accumulation, daily use of buying items/goods? In Norway people own approx equally amounts of stocks as crypto. I would say that’s pretty cool adoption wise if you think about accumumation/amounts of people exposed towards crypto.

2880 2019-01-06 21:12:49 I’d argue the capital gains tax should just be generally increased, with maybe a small untaxed first portion. Less than half of Americans even own stocks, bonds, etc.; the only people making significant capital gains are already the richest people in our society.

2885 2019-01-06 21:10:00 When you stab us in the back and give the real gun grabbers another tipped domino with the bump stock ban. (No I don't care about bump stocks, it's the precedence set that pisses me off.)

2887 2019-01-06 21:09:04 see you got out at the peak. I got out too late and lost some of my gains but thankfully didn't lose all of them. Poor saps that are still watching are holding on to penny stocks now.

2889 2019-01-06 21:07:50 Les stocks de morue se sont effondrés peu de temps après le pic de débarquement. Pourtant, la technologie s'améliorait tout le temps et le pris augmentait avec la rareté. Les pêcheurs étaient les vrais experts, pas les biologistes, c'est bien connu.

2910 2019-01-06 20:46:20 The rally in stocks can continue from here with Powell actually being dovish, but investors are still over exposed US equities so outflow will continue 

Therefore seller will once again dominate, most likely by the end of Jan
2911 2019-01-06 20:46:06 BlackRock and Blackstone are my favorites due to their upside - two asset management companies. 

BlackRock is down a huge chunk right now - taking a shot w them.

Also, ton of REIT stocks since 2008 financial crash -- decent dividend payments along w/ buying low at the time
2912 2019-01-06 20:45:46 Fictitious capital? Those companies don't exist? They don't have assets? Human, technological, and physical capital? How is that fictitious? Who would buy stock in something that had no actual value? How do you think stocks work exactly?
2913 2019-01-06 20:44:32 @MrColionNoir How come the NRA is doing nothing about the bump stocks?
2914 2019-01-06 20:44:01 Yes we do. Aston Martin, Morgan, Nobel and many others. And no car produced in this country relies on frictionless European supply. They all hold stocks which they will increase following Brexit. You think we'll let your German friends / EU dictate to us?
2915 2019-01-06 20:42:27 @realDonaldTrump president data from 1926 onwards shows that when we have a bad quarter like the one we had in stocks in q4, in 3 years following that we see an increase of 91 percent , similar very positive growth numbers in the following year and following 2 years
2916 2019-01-06 20:42:26 This is a good time for investors to be overweight utility and consumer staples stocks plus some names in the healthcare sector. These are defensive sectors that have potential & momentum to perform well in highly volatile market environments.
2917 2019-01-06 20:42:06 Google taxation and google what amazon pays... you will get the ideas. Bezos gets most of his income via stocks that he reinvests and thus does not pay much while increasing his net worth with the upward stock price.

2921 2019-01-06 20:39:57 The only ones who truly suffer from this outcome are those who attempt to preserve present capital values  (in relation to labor) that defy any logical valuation metric. Our stocks, our houses, our "fixed income", our moneys. All propped up artificially.

2924 2019-01-06 20:38:15 I realize people don't CHOOSE paycheck to paycheck. And I realize that some situations you can't do stuff like invest in stocks, or use decent yield savings accounts, or even start a blog or freelance. But if the opportunity is there, one should seriously consider taking it.
2925 2019-01-06 20:37:06 How are stocks not the real economy? Those are shares of actual businesses, you know, right?
2926 2019-01-06 20:36:27 If you need help getting rid of any additional stocks, just, you know, let me know ... [grin]
2927 2019-01-06 20:35:40 Not correct! Budgets have to be within perimeters for Eurozone. Even food packaging must conform! Remember the distraught salmon wholesaler in the UK who was forced to 're package all his salmon stocks with the words "This Product Contained Fish"?
2928 2019-01-06 20:32:31 I want to see them try that in all states? If they did, some people will be arrested, including them. Did they know the Vegas shooter went through background checks and bump stocks have been banned by Donald Trump's administration since the shooting?

2939 2019-01-06 20:23:01 Yeah, it’s odd. I am in Switzerland. Sentiment like Germany: majority anyway missed the train 10y ago so they hardly noticed that markets is at 2yrs low (or many value stocks at 5yrs low). Bonds or real estate crash would kill them.

2948 2019-01-06 20:17:55 No, because the mining component only has data since 1984. But this chart would show the same bear market that Gold shows for this time frame, as Autumn is bullish for speculations in stocks, bonds and real estate and bearish for precious metals (and commodities generally).

2954 2019-01-06 20:15:04 Market action– Great rally on Friday, but given the breakdown since October, can only be viewed as a counter trend rally in an overall negative environment for stocks. Odds favor the downtrend reasserting. For me now, preserving mental and financial capital are paramount.
2955 2019-01-06 20:14:34 All I know is that the Trump administration recently banned bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre. Some folks have said it wasn't a wise move.

2982 2019-01-06 19:54:12 You assume that "the rich" are all people who make their money by building businesses that hire a lot of people. They aren't. They invest in stocks and derivatives and property, etc. They suck the wealth out of the economy and build NOTHING with it.
2983 2019-01-06 19:53:58 That is the hope of investors. Companies sell stocks to increase revenue usually for research and development. That doesn’t usually up the employment much

3009 2019-01-06 19:37:32 Want to get into stocks
3010 2019-01-06 19:37:31 777 stocks taken?
3011 2019-01-06 19:37:28 How did ppl trade stocks prior to Web Platforms? How was instant trading introduced to the stock market without imploding the system? How many jobs were lost? Why is there still a trading floor?
3012 2019-01-06 19:36:51 Exactly, that's the main problem with trying to tax the rich. People redesign income, so that they get less from wages and more through stocks and financial instruments.
3013 2019-01-06 19:36:03 It's going to bring more volume but don't know how much. They are introducing something good like tokenized stocks. Let's see
3014 2019-01-06 19:35:43 Yes I do for some stocks which I know have a higher probability on the chart .
3015 2019-01-06 19:35:27 Don’t you have some stocks to watch or something?? Please stay out of politics, your ignorance really shows...

3018 2019-01-06 19:33:55 Very good news... Then we're going to make 20% off the next 2 days on our Antminer z9. Only for $CRYP minig. While stocks last.
3019 2019-01-06 19:33:44 MLPs issue shares so traded like stocks...that's the only difference I know of
3020 2019-01-06 19:32:46 I even purchase gold.... my mom worked HARD to teach us about the value in stocks and commodities. When i purchased my first house, she said purchase thinking of the long term. Land is more important than the house itself... I've even purchased land!
3021 2019-01-06 19:32:41 It's gonna be too hilarious when @jimcramer and his Eagles lose to the Bears, during a BEAR market in stocks LOL.
3022 2019-01-06 19:32:25 Digital stocks about to go live.
Digital assets as real-time collateral.
Liquidity building each day.
Global understanding too.

2019 is encouraging to say the least!

3025 2019-01-06 19:28:10 You really should add XRP as a base pair to the stocks. The XRP community is massive and listing that will get a lot of business your way.

3029 2019-01-06 19:26:15 Gotta compete. Gotta produce real value. It's not easy, but nobody said it would be. That said, the Fed did the working class wrong. The Fed caused a wealth transfer from the poor to rich (stocks) with low interest rates.

Low wages => high stocks
3030 2019-01-06 19:24:27 On the technical side of thing, I would say Bear market. But it does makes some good entry on some beat down stocks, for the next bull run.
3031 2019-01-06 19:23:21 Our shop team @EdwardsofConwy will check stocks for you on Monday :-)
3032 2019-01-06 19:22:46 By the way, in case you miss the point - no bump stocks were used in any of those videos.
3033 2019-01-06 19:22:01 Customer:Do you sell home phone batteries?
Me: no
Customer: why?
Me: because we sell cell phones
Customer: well that’s stupid no wonder your stocks are going down
Lmao I’m just tryna watch some football
3034 2019-01-06 19:21:19 It’s a regulated exchange in EU just like wirex. It does use NASDAQs matching engine, and will offer tokenized stocks, but it’s not a Nasdaq regulated or even related to the Nasdaq company beside the matching engine license....
3035 2019-01-06 19:20:59 Are you suggesting the money generated from UK fish stocks fished by other EU nations is "inward investment "? Come again?
3036 2019-01-06 19:20:34 So my guess is, you don't have a portfolio and it bothers you that i do.... mama didn't raise no dummy... Stocks, bonds from my Bat Mitzvah, I purchase commodities regularly. Yea, I have a broad portfolio. But my stocks, yea, those have taken some good hits
3037 2019-01-06 19:20:29 @CryptoShillNye I think this brings a whole new perspective being able to trade digitalised stocks as well as #Crypto. This is the future happening right here.
3038 2019-01-06 19:20:06 I just want to make enough  to pay off my BA and MA degrees, earn an MBA in Marketing, earn a law degree in IP, own a home, run my biz, invest in stocks, spoil my mom and sis, maintain my credit/health, donate to charity & support my  addiction 
3039 2019-01-06 19:19:09 once you work in finance and specially in any kind of broker and understand how everything works, you get to see how the business really works and where the money is really made. I'll give you all a clue: it's not by the performance of the stocks/fund nor is it in 'being right'.

3043 2019-01-06 19:16:18 It Will soon be one of many..but as of now, it is the first to ever digitalize stocks with crypto/blockchain
3044 2019-01-06 19:15:49 It's a good question (I don't have an answer) and you could add the same for fish. It would be possible to sustainably harvest a limited amount of fish from our waters even as stocks recover.
3045 2019-01-06 19:14:08 Yes hopefully everyone knows that obvious point..Look into the exchange..youll understand..to list a couple key points.. Fully regulated..Nasdaq powered tech..digital stocks..

3048 2019-01-06 19:12:16 I've finished reading the book, but i don't know the next step i should take in learning penny stocks.
3049 2019-01-06 19:12:16 But, to be fair, the ultra-rich (who right now only pay maybe 15% ONLY on the winning stocks they sell in a given year IF they don't have an offshore tax haven, which they do) may go from paying like 2% of their income to maybe 3% or 4% -- while we pay much higher %. Socialism!
3050 2019-01-06 19:12:12 Heck yeah. My stocks went up 4.8% collectively
3051 2019-01-06 19:12:08 you know what, I'm fine with throwing that guy in stocks, it's free beer and he's asking for a substitution then questioning the type and quality of it.

3059 2019-01-06 19:07:42 @DXdotExchange 

Just to be clear. Can you buy fractional Shares of stocks like amazon with bitcoin and Ethereum?   Also you get the fractional dividend correct? 

Finally please add XRP to buy traditonal stocks soon

Thank you for helping. Can you let me know thanks again.
3060 2019-01-06 19:07:22 Not interested in pot stocks anymore?
3061 2019-01-06 19:04:49 Stocks are not doing much. So little participation in precious metals compaed to actual metal. #redflag imho
3062 2019-01-06 19:03:57 Nifty will fall again to 9900 this year before Loksabha election. This year my work will be more difficult than last year. Last year Midcaps and Small caps corrected by 40-60%. This year entire Market will fall. I will come up with election-proof stocks in my YouTube channel soon
3063 2019-01-06 19:02:25 If you can't handle 10-15% fall in your stock price you should not invest in Share Market but if your stock is down by 50% then you certainly dont have any right to be in share Market. Stop Loss is the most important risk management tool. #nifty #sensex #StockMarket #stocks
3064 2019-01-06 19:01:11 Those who will invest in right stocks before Loksabha elections will earn more than 40-50% returns till December 2019. And thode who will invest in wrong stock will lose 50-60% till December 2019. These 4 months are very crucial for Investors. #nifty #sensex #Market #stocks
3065 2019-01-06 19:00:34 yeah closing out stocks. 
I use Ridley.
3066 2019-01-06 19:00:10 I’m pretty sure they are a slime mould of some type. The fungus Frnugreek Stalkballs Can look very much like slime mould fruiting bodies, but their stocks are the same colour as the pinheads and they are a little larger.
3067 2019-01-06 18:58:46 Ya but the ground reality's that the economy is indeed getting worse day after day. Stocks r down ridiculously, gold & USD is up, & so is inflation. While most of that was expected, troubling is the sheer absence of any respite.
3068 2019-01-06 18:57:50 Facts matter dude 40 house seats, more senate seats in play. Yes we lost 2, but you have more in jeopardy now. See who gets last laugh. Feeling confident for Dems. Any answer to the BS you posted about stocks. Facts matter pal
3069 2019-01-06 18:57:15 You said a he'll of alot in the point in time. Knifed Turnbull. Tried to gift Shifty Dutt's PM position now you both are laughing stocks. Are you a Labour Spy?
3070 2019-01-06 18:56:45 You aren’t  trying to get your stocks up  are you?? Beware of tiny fines!!
3071 2019-01-06 18:56:25 I just want a train game that isn't like any other train game (please, no stocks, operating rounds, and lots of boring accounting).
3072 2019-01-06 18:55:46 Finishing the matches as in closing out the stocks? What character are you using if you dont mind me asking?
3073 2019-01-06 18:54:53 Legally they can buy stocks continuously. It is customary that they cease for several weeks around earnings.
3074 2019-01-06 18:54:38 J'ai une erreur sur les stocks disponibles après avoir entré mon num de CB jvais buter quelqu'un et ce sera un manager
3075 2019-01-06 18:54:06 The politics & prejudice of Palamau were indeed problematic, but it's also a fascinating book. It's both a product of its time and very different from anything else being written then.
And now I want to read it again. Thankfully Amazon stocks it.
3076 2019-01-06 18:53:54 In Devon we often have empty shelves as the stocks run out daily. When we had snow last year, there was no bread or milk for three days. Cornwall will be worse.
3077 2019-01-06 18:53:14 I KNOW YOU WANNA BUY MY STOCKS
3078 2019-01-06 18:52:54 I dnt track would be penny stocks
3079 2019-01-06 18:51:11 And which will live longer... It's not about mere years and stocks.. it's about creating a brand new level and type of asset, that has unique new properties
3080 2019-01-06 18:50:56 I call for a full repeal of the red flag measures in CS7026, as well as the amendments of CS7026 banning bump stocks and binary triggers; and a full repeal of the other " requirements " in CS7026 that infringe on the 2nd Amendment. @AndrewPollackFL @marcorubio @RepBrianMast
3081 2019-01-06 18:48:59 Of course BTC outperformed, my point is the patience required to have made those returns, whether in BTC or Stocks requires you spend half your time waiting for it to recover from a previous bear cycle. Most today need a reminder of the long term perspective required for success
3082 2019-01-06 18:48:05 It’s not all in the bank. Most of it is invested in stocks, bonds, and other investments. Banks have a notoriously low rate of return. No billionaire is keeping all his/her money in the bank
3083 2019-01-06 18:47:50 1.1.2020: The Green Army Fraction drone attacks have let to a shutdown of the 20 largest airports in Europe.
As the attacks go into their third weeks, railroad stocks have quadruplet.
3084 2019-01-06 18:47:42 You cannot fix stupid.  Kidding, kind of.  But some % of people always love to gamble. But this is a minority by a large amount I think.  The only way I can see large % peeps in alts is by way of ETF's if they are dumb enough to create them. Would be like an ETF of penny stocks.
3085 2019-01-06 18:47:26 Stocks aren’t goods.

3086 2019-01-06 18:45:56 @DiMartinoBooth Hi this is Keith, I thought that Corps were allowed to buy back their stocks in Feb, May, Aug, & Nov.  Are there other months that Corps are allowed to buy back? thanks  : ]
3087 2019-01-06 18:45:39 They didn’t lose a dollar if they never sold their stocks and bonds
3088 2019-01-06 18:45:25 Re-read everything I wrote and realize you are just wasting our time. Possibly because you misread or misinterpreted the thread and now your ego won't let you stop. Did not offer a holy grail but showed one can do better than B&H.

Can =/ will

BTC =/ stocks.

Have a nice Sunday.

3092 2019-01-06 18:42:35 The man needs to stop listening to FOX NEWS. Why are you touting how well the stock market is after one day. The coward never spoke a word when the stocks were falling everywhere.
Sir you are boring and very dangerous for our country.

3094 2019-01-06 18:40:05 the idea that women are more spiritual is an absurd lie. Spiritual works and institutions are crafted by men. Women depraved prostitutes, and the traditional means of mitigating that in Europe involved the branks and pillory stocks-- punishment for misbehaviors, not coddling.

3096 2019-01-06 18:39:03 I really like the Seeking Alpha. Like you said, gotta be careful on the advice, but it offers an other perspective. I find that a number of the contributors to the oil and gas stocks to be pretty informed and many some have been in the trenches in the industry.
3097 2019-01-06 18:38:53 Apparently DT don't get domino effect-->No pay/no tax return->ppl cashing in IRAs->stocks crash.. and those are the lucky ones.. not taking into account those who must survive, feed children with no pay-> can't go to work, can't afford day care.nightmare trickle down scenario.
3098 2019-01-06 18:38:36 Anglers aren’t denting salmon stocks.  Predation at sea and salmon farming are the major causes IMO.  Most salmon beats have a warning on tickets not to disturb salmon redds and they shouldn’t wade above knee level in any case.  Should be strict about adhering to those rules.

3111 2019-01-06 18:26:53 its not liking the rock having that extra ~30m is efficient. whats he gonna do with it? put it in treasuries and stocks? unless he buys a mansion every year, or VC's 5 start ups PA. that money is locked up. in both cases no obligation.
3112 2019-01-06 18:25:38 why the fuck are people doing 2 stocks
3113 2019-01-06 18:24:34 Eh...Xmas shut down usually means stocks are low due to lack of deliveries 
3114 2019-01-06 18:23:43 Hanging man??? Shooting star... would mean stocks going up next days
3115 2019-01-06 18:19:51 Absolutely true, this one I will agree. Also lots of dems own stocks in defence contractors as well, more so then republicans. Now trump doesn't know that but it's ok I can give you one now and then.
3116 2019-01-06 18:19:32 I assume that you don’t advocate fishing over the quota level since those levels are there in order to allow fish stocks to slowly recuperate from over fishing.
3117 2019-01-06 18:19:27 so I fought armada like an hour ago and got my booty cheeks eaten by him but I was able to take some stocks so we take those

3119 2019-01-06 18:18:36 @GrooveCubeMusic wants bear during hot stocks .
3120 2019-01-06 18:18:16 Pension funds are one of the things causing the crash. Once rates are high enough, they want out of stocks and into bonds, because they need steady yield to make payments to pensioners. The other thing is a demographic time bomb. Those boomers are withdrawing instead of saving :(
3121 2019-01-06 18:17:47 You cant select stocks (is always 1 stock per character). Thats kinda sad, it would be better if u cant select the number of stocks in that mode
3122 2019-01-06 18:16:20 @FINRA does not care too much about OTC stocks as long as they’re current and paid the fees the RS will more  likely be approved, Jacob is already celebrating, I hope I’m wrong and it gets deny $RDAR
3123 2019-01-06 18:14:25 Ah Tommy, been there,  your crypto holdings will eventually be worth more than your stocks would have been. Better to have lost, learn and apply than to have held them and you might never have entered crypto. #silverlining
3124 2019-01-06 18:10:43 @iancassel do you look/invest at/in foreign equity markets as well? Micro caps yield high returns, but similar stocks in developing economies provide higher returns, taking into account any currency rate changes.
3125 2019-01-06 18:09:45 Reading a book on trading stocks. Sitting on the sofa with a PDF open on the desktop screen zoomed to 350%. Alternating that with Sunday afternoon micro naps.
3126 2019-01-06 18:08:35 If you are a long term Investor better to avoid such stocks
3127 2019-01-06 18:08:13 But the media does not report on Trump’s policies, only that someone in his cabinet might have called him a moron,etc. They don’t report on the strong economy, lower taxes, job expansions, ban on bump stocks, etc.
3128 2019-01-06 18:07:04 Why was I into those stocks at the time?  Well I worked in the Nuke plants.  But the real reason was that during a refuel outage I was getting some project data from the Licensing Group and they were talking about fuel.  At that time they were discussing that a load was $70 mil.

3131 2019-01-06 18:05:05 Well, I guess that is good.  But, for me those that have been here for a long time know I was in the U stocks in '06 to '11 and until now.  I even went to my old tax returns and outlined my trades back then and described the crazy stock moves that were like tech stocks at times.
3132 2019-01-06 18:04:00 BREAKING NEWS! Trump tweets that drug prices are too high! Pharmaceutical stocks drop by 50% as companies scramble to slash prices!!!
3133 2019-01-06 18:03:50 What Buffet tells people to do, and what he does are different. He buys individual stocks. Not S+P funds like he is telling people in this article, apparently. Also, his pick was right aside from the crash . REIT usually pays high dividend that will beat treasury bod rates.
3134 2019-01-06 18:03:36 Very interested in investing in stocks, anyone know of anyone who does well with this? Feel like everything I find is someone trying to sell me a course but show little to no results.

3135 2019-01-06 18:02:37 If there is stock market that bets on people not companies stocks, I would bet a MWISENEZA Josiane for not being Miss Rwanda 2019 not because I am against her but because I would want returns.

It would be good if she becomes miss Rwanda but it is not gonna happen.

3147 2019-01-06 17:56:50 Some stocks were seriously impacted by move of many indices to float market cap in 00-05 after themselves affecting indices to a smaller relative degree prior to that. It was an event trade 13-18yrs ago. % of total mktcap which was pure hard-tracking passive then was a lot lower.

3158 2019-01-06 17:50:59 I generally think that holding has its merits for people who can't or don't want to trade. But since I made a huge mistake and sold some stocks too early (tax!) I hope for the worst crash of all time just to make myself feel less of a moron.

3175 2019-01-06 17:35:22 Yup. Exactly that. One of my mid-sized clients smartly checked all their stocks before Xmas. We figured out a way to use all kinds of stuff they had on hand. These folks are too big to do everything by hand, but still merge and print TYs in house.
3176 2019-01-06 17:34:33 There you go again actually making sense with something useful. So I’m going to try to add a useful comment.  The market looks ahead six months or even a year ahead so regardless of whether we have a resession or not your stocks can get clobbered by a bear market.
3177 2019-01-06 17:32:19 Nothing about what Republicans do regarding the economy is intelligent or ethical. It’s all built on sand. When it collapses (again) the wealthy will use the opportunity to amass more wealth. They’ll forclose on people’s homes, buy up cheap real estate & stocks &

3186 2019-01-06 17:25:17 Let me give you some advice.  If you haven't seen the volatility in the market and with Apple in the past two months, then you should probably keep your investment money in an index fund and avoid individual stocks.  If you don't do the work, you won't get the right results.
3187 2019-01-06 17:24:58 We tried to buy a new smart ForTwo EQ to replace our 8 yr old ICE smart but none were available before Apr/May.

3191 2019-01-06 17:21:53 Defending the rich as usual.  Sad.  For years the rich have hid their money overseas and cheated the system. You don’t seem to have a problem with cheating.  Stocks should be 10 times higher but the offshore money doesn’t figure into company profits.  Total scam!

so he won't do that again - lot of effort for essentially nothing
3193 2019-01-06 17:19:29 Folks are all out there selling you 2019 playbook, top sectors and stocks to invest.

3194 2019-01-06 17:19:28 If you’re truly long term you hold through the next bull and bear markets. Play it like Warren Buffet. He held stocks through the wars, crashing and bull markets. He’s still holding.
3195 2019-01-06 17:18:40 Definetly need one or all of those law suits in support of bump stocks to win.

3205 2019-01-06 17:12:45 I agree but wait for $VIX to drop below 18. Everything will be fine after that. More than 50% of stocks are getting close to 50MA. After that pajama traders will open their 50RSI shop. Right now this market is controlled by futures traders.
3206 2019-01-06 17:12:32 it's just wise to have much balanced view now and not overweight stocks although the uptrend could last a bit longer or simply consolidate make marginal lows and climb back up..look at emerging markets (Russia/brazim/eem/turkey) and all..the went down like 30%-40%  and climbed up

Ask him 'what's at the table. Is it properties, companies, rising stocks'?

Coz most times it's unfaithfulness, one sided relationship and Lies!!!
3220 2019-01-06 17:02:16 Remainers really do think they are believable, the only thing that is believable about them is that they did not have enough votes to get their way in 2016. I actually find them laughing stocks!
3221 2019-01-06 17:01:22 In my economics class we are doing some sort of competition with stocks where we "invest" in a company and whoever makes the most "money" (or would have if we actually invested) gets a cash prize or something.

3247 2019-01-06 16:41:05 There is a fuzzy correlation between oil and stocks/bonds.

To over simplify, that is what is at work. Think Jan/Feb 2016.

Petro dollars printed = equity/bond flows positive —> stocks up, rates down. 

And the reverse. But — what if the US is oil independent? And China slows?
3248 2019-01-06 16:40:59 Even after December's tumble, I don't view stocks as being inexpensive.  There are some exceptions as always but my general outlook is modestly bearish in terms of total performance.  You would be foolish not to have an ample cash position and patience to sit on your hands.

3254 2019-01-06 16:38:34 Good question. We did research a while back that found the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 did a pretty good job of replicating its performance, but that hasn't been updated in nearly 20 years, so not sure if it's still valid.

3269 2019-01-06 16:24:15 I am investing in stocks for last two years. Couldn't believe a retail investor like me could live on dividends. Would be thankful if you can give a rough guide even in your blog. Thanks sir.
3270 2019-01-06 16:23:49 Don't worry. A @MarkCalabria FHFA director ship will put the GSEs into receivership. Kiss those stocks and the housing market goodbye.

3272 2019-01-06 16:22:16 People look for prices of stocks which they buy on daily basis. Unfortunately, they don't track the prices of the real estate or the flat that they bought on daily basis why? Think and introspect.........

3274 2019-01-06 16:22:00 Despite Nacho and Ghezzal, if this side fails to win today we should have the stocks out at the Clock Tower and throw rotten fruit and veg at the lot of them
3275 2019-01-06 16:21:48 Thank you, Stew, I was running a scan looking for relative strength and wasn't sure if the PEG applied to downtrending stocks. I saved some that were above the 200 dy still.
3276 2019-01-06 16:21:38 It allows trading of stocks, as tokenized assets. Likely will bring some "real investors" and help legitimize crypto.
3277 2019-01-06 16:20:48 Also why traditional value stocks (p/b) do well in inflationary times, no?  Debt inflated away?
3278 2019-01-06 16:20:41 Just a bit. Laughing stocks. Fair play to Oldham. League 2 though.  The Khan's need to give Ranieri everyone he asks for as this current lot will get bummed by every team outside the bottom 6 (and arguably in it).

3281 2019-01-06 16:18:43 Is it applicable to stocks like Bosch & Wabco... Always commanding high PE. I read a report about Bosch few days ago, where they mentioned it's difficult to get such kind of premium valuations in the era of disruption & vulnerable to macro factors.

3289 2019-01-06 16:13:54 For the sake if full disclosure, I’m not a die-hard stock guy either. I generally only buy stocks into companies whose products I use on a daily basis (my toothpaste, my tech, etc.) I was playing WoW and Hearthstone long before I bought stock in the company.

3294 2019-01-06 16:09:46 now we might have years where global stock markets don't give extraordinary returns like 10-15% and that 5%-10% will be the new norm and that it will be lead to healthier and more stable returns over the long run...This just doesn't mean that we need to dump all stocks

3305 2019-01-06 16:02:51 Actually that could work. I am hoping to never have to sell my #XRP. I am hoping one day to be able to buy anything with it. Other stocks, cryptos, truck, house, groceries, everything. 
3306 2019-01-06 16:01:49 5) Congress started looking at banning “bump stocks,” after the device Las Vegas shooting in October 2018. Dec. Trump announced a ban on bump stocks. The  problem is that federal agencies don’t have the authority to regulate the devices.
3307 2019-01-06 16:01:47 They blame you that their stocks have crashed.  Shows how stupid or blind they are.  Stocks crashed 
when they took over congress.

I’m not saying it’s right... I’m saying dealing in business/stocks - there will always be ups and downs in that journey.
3311 2019-01-06 15:58:15 Still, not convinced that making money from selling a stock to another person, which was bought from another person, is worthwhile investment activity. Especially for stocks that don't pay a dividend.

3321 2019-01-06 15:51:41 The comments from these “women” have little to do with Islam,sharia, not even socialism-are more from their vile disrespect for the millions of DJTvoters and  a bogus zeal for their new found political power.

3330 2019-01-06 15:45:19 Many stocks well oversold, many will rally creating a market and trade opportunities, the unprecedented uncertainty increases the volatility and holders need to be nimble. A good entry is key and protecting capital.

3332 2019-01-06 15:43:45 Also, I heard about a story where a smaller hub borrow stocks to a bigger hub para lang may mabigay sa patients nila while they wait for their own stocks which aren’t delivered yet.
3333 2019-01-06 15:43:21 There is a giant mountain of evidence to the contrary regarding investment. We just gave them trillions. They bought stocks back. To the tune of over a trillion and counting. It wasn't reinvested, at least not at the rates sold to us.
3334 2019-01-06 15:42:41 Dumb q, but if you wanted to just show that you usu beat S&P500, couldn't you invest in S&P490, drop the 10 lowest performing stocks, and rebalance annually? Once in a while, those 10 will be stars the following year, but wouldn't you mostly be right over say a 30 yr horizon?

3336 2019-01-06 15:41:20 He is the national emergency. Hopefully this all ends with him in public stocks for each good American to come by and pee in his mouth — or something equally horrible and humiliating that prevents the next Trump from rising to power.
3337 2019-01-06 15:41:09 Maybe stocks are overvalued from decades of Govt deficit spending causing inflation & a pullback is good. Consumers need jobs from small biz, 70% job creator.
3338 2019-01-06 15:40:25 By asset deflation, do you mean stocks, shares, properties etc? Derivatives? Am I missing any?

How is a decreasing population very deflationary? Honest layman’s question.

Do CBs believe that crypto can be stifled, and that CBs and Govs have effective enough levers to do that?
3339 2019-01-06 15:40:00 It's really surprising you sold USL too early,I thought you always bullish on Alcoholic stocks (after Tom Russo) BTW... Missing your weekend "spirits" tweets from last couple of weeks.

3341 2019-01-06 15:39:53 However, for hubs that are smaller or for those who are in provinces and with only fewer stocks on hand, I believe they are referring their patients to bigger hubs with greater supplies and can accommodate more patients given they will enroll in that hub.
3342 2019-01-06 15:38:12 Ehhhh yo no te veo criticando a Petro por tales cagadas ...por ejemplo confundir stocks de acciones con inventarios ...o a un científico boyacense con un actor de porno...para UD lo de la campaña libertadora fue un error? Ahí es donde uno puede burlarse de uds...

3346 2019-01-06 15:35:52 In our hospital we dispense meds in scarce (like Nevirapine) good for their 1 month supply only instead of the usual 3. This we do just so we can balance and distribute evenly our stocks on hand to patients who are to start or in maintenance of the drug.
3347 2019-01-06 15:34:59 Were building a legal team to fight the bump stock ban as well. Did you know inside the “bump stock” ban bill it also includes any modifications that increase your rate of fire from the guns original stats. This includes grips, triggers, stocks, and anything else that may be used
3348 2019-01-06 15:34:23 Id say we are shortly before a mass walkout is announced and air travel grinds to a halt. 

Wouldn’t be surprised if some folks already deferring travel to avoid delays and risk of being stranded somewhere. 

Airline stocks gonna tank as planes run late, empty get grounded.
3349 2019-01-06 15:33:56 Would be terrible but thats why theve put measures such holding reserve stocks. Remember the wealthy will lose money if this is a fuck up when the rich are loosing things dont stay fucked for long. I get specialist treatment and medication every month and am not worried i promise
3350 2019-01-06 15:33:30 Still ... you haven’t once talked about nor come close to thanking President Trump for his gun policy changes last year! Nor the tougher gun laws, hardening schools or banning bump stocks ! Shame on you!
3351 2019-01-06 15:33:14 If that is true, why was December 2018 the worst month for stocks since the Great Depression?
3352 2019-01-06 15:32:50 Cual? La del inepto populista que considera que el Liceo Francés es un colegio público y que confunde el concepto de stocks en la bolsa d valores con el de inventarios? Con Petroburro gobernando ese sí sería la verdadera competencia de Maduro

3357 2019-01-06 15:26:21 If you have a 401K check price u bought stocks at & where they are now. If those corp did a buyback,ur stock will be way up there in value. My advice,sell it now. When the bubble burst,there will be no profit.
3358 2019-01-06 15:25:48 Stock buybacks support the company and stock holders, not their employees or the general public that don’t invest in stocks but live paycheck to paycheck Mr 1%.

3361 2019-01-06 15:21:49 If you’d invest 1000$ into #btc 10 years ago, you would have $3.829 billion. On this #btc price which is $3829. 
Of course, if we take all-time high $20k BTC then, you could make $20 billion.
So #stocks are like a kids game.
3362 2019-01-06 15:21:18 Can someone recommend a good book for investing in stocks? The Intelligent Investor isn’t doing it for me.

3364 2019-01-06 15:20:02 I don’t think they are true hedge funds...which can actually provide a valuable “insurance” like service in the economy...(when they are not just legalized gambling operations). But, instead the private equity firms turn the demand for stocks into an internal buyout operation?
3365 2019-01-06 15:19:37 Realy??? In which stocks?
3366 2019-01-06 15:18:30 Ok, the dude is an atheist so you can scratch out a few things on your list. He’s taking babies from their parents so, there is that. He just took bump stocks away from you, so there is that. And the tax reform was for the rich. So, are you a liar or are you stupid? Which one?
3367 2019-01-06 15:17:52 Just an idea... Invest social security in encyclopedia stocks, outlaw the internet. You remove the president's platform, return power to it's rightful place(Jim Acosta) and insure that Democrats can succeed in their honorable quest to fix every citizens life.
3368 2019-01-06 15:17:13 Would love to see an “Rule 1” style toolbox made for validating stocks the way that are outlined in Invested.

3372 2019-01-06 15:12:35 Clearly not. 3 weeks after Parkland, he passed sweeping gun laws; must b 21 to own a gun now, mandatory 3 day wait periods, ban on bump stocks, & more. Only ppl that hurts; law abiding citizens.

3378 2019-01-06 15:03:59 You were right at the beginning. You were wrong with your exsmples. What are you talking about? I dont want to see ECR20 tokens in my wallet. I want to see cash, stocks, my mortgage. Make it for the crowds man, not crypto-nerds.
3379 2019-01-06 15:02:19 You may trade like this :

Suppose if u want to buy 500 stocks of hdfc bank than u buy 250 stocks as per daily charts and remaining 250 based on weekly charts. 

Same way while selling follow daily and weekly charts both. Daily is short term view and weekly is medium term view.

We're supposed to believe that the 'Value' of stocks change that much in a single day?
Maybe someday, the SEC will get around to taking some action against this blatant manipulation!
3383 2019-01-06 15:00:21 My stocks are collectively at a 23.86% loss in the last few months.... I’m gonna stop checking them & trading.... fuck it now! Somethings afoot on the horizon

3390 2019-01-06 14:53:58 Witness the power of words. Having been elevated to the level  of deity failure to worship the word 'inclusive' now constitutes  blasphemy. The punishment is to be put in the 'stocks' for a few days on social media followed by banishment.
3391 2019-01-06 14:53:05 Stocks naik turun ampass :( tanah aja invest
3392 2019-01-06 14:52:38 Well US crude stocks are building as we enter refinery TA, so reducing exports to US should be natural and seen with less scepticism. I think Economic headwinds are far more important now to fundamentals than supply side issues. Tweet could hence depend on that plus US O&G Capex?
3393 2019-01-06 14:52:34 AOC a very strong buy signal on popcorn  and soda stocks. 

How many times have we seen someone rise so fast to the top of the charts only to come crashing down. She better have a good support foundation. 

Honestly I don’t think I could handle it.
3394 2019-01-06 14:51:32 Omg. You don’t understand stocks at all.
3395 2019-01-06 14:51:22 I feel like Buying some stocks this morning

3401 2019-01-06 14:46:40 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your cancer
3402 2019-01-06 14:46:20 U.S. retirees try to keep cool as stocks tumble
3403 2019-01-06 14:45:54 I still dance around it in my articles. If the track or tour calls 'em Pro Stocks, I stick with that. No point in confusing the occasional n00b.
3404 2019-01-06 14:45:17 You lost a lot of stocks to flare blitz into get bodied
3405 2019-01-06 14:45:04 Omg Looks like they’re in the stocks!
3406 2019-01-06 14:45:02 Whenever President Trump bashes a company, it tells me I need to push it before stocks drop and hopefully be fortunate to catch the gains.
3407 2019-01-06 14:44:36 It's simple. Investing long term and holding it until the company buys the stock back is good. Going public and randomly trading stocks via speculation gambling is not. Trading has no benefit or influence on the company but rather works on perception only. It just raises prices.
3408 2019-01-06 14:44:22 New England is literally the only area I have ever been to in my life that uses the name Pro Stock. entire rest of the country (and Canada) says Pro Late or Super Late. I called them Pro Stocks in FL once and I was looked at funny.
3409 2019-01-06 14:44:07 What great results? I'm seeing an ongoing government shutdown, petulant whining about the pointless border wall, a trade war with China, stocks in the toilet, and let's not forget the fucking concentration camps for immigrants and deaths of multiple children in our custody.
3410 2019-01-06 14:42:48 Upcoming Earnings Alert:

3411 2019-01-06 14:42:33 It adds value to his pockets when pharmaceutical stocks drop Monday morning and his company buys their stocks. Then he will say he's working with them and its going great and his company will make a killing. Simple stock manipulation.

I have a new financial system that is guaranteed to make you money if you follow it.

Here’s what you do. You buy stocks low and sell them when they go up.

3413 2019-01-06 14:40:41 Doesn't move? Stocks are not idle, the money is used by companies to grow! Savings also are not idle, they are used by banks to lend to others. That money represents capital, thats what made the west rich, because the money is where it is most efficient/effective for the economy
3414 2019-01-06 14:37:43 But if I'm going to see the Supers, those cars have wings on them. SLMs, Pro Stocks...I just call them by sanctioning body for simplicity.
3415 2019-01-06 14:37:05 I was reading yesterday about the Hungry Gap - the period between the end of March and the end of May when the UK’s winter veg stocks have been exhausted and the spring veg stocks are not yet mature. Guess what we usually do then...

3418 2019-01-06 14:35:39 @tim_cook Mr. Cook, the reason your stocks are taking such a hit is mis-management, your overpriced products, your making them in China mostly,we dont want to support a company that does not hold AMERICAN ideals, why by a product when all you do as a company is market this so ...

3421 2019-01-06 14:33:19 please explain how it's a bad policy to tax 1,000,000 at 70% (after they already made 10 million ) Most of that money is just going to stocks and savings. They money doesn't move and it hurts the economy. Not to mention the deficit we SUPPOSEDLY care about.
3422 2019-01-06 14:33:16 In the peak bull market of 2017 here someone created a random portfolio generator built of 10 stocks and it beat the index 7-8 times out of 10 on any given refresh
3423 2019-01-06 14:32:51 damn i can't beleive the communist millennials want to take away all the money I earned by telling someone else to do stuff and sitting on nasdaq stocks for 10 years
3424 2019-01-06 14:31:25 3/ beat the market, simply by chance. That's why we insist on looking at how a strategy performs in as many market environments as we have data for--sometimes things can even work for 5 years but end up being very bad strategies, like buying the 50 stocks with the highest
3425 2019-01-06 14:31:23 Oh should i show you how screwed my stocks are right now? Wtf says "twit" anymore?
3426 2019-01-06 14:31:18 I basically gave Wolf two free stocks 
3427 2019-01-06 14:30:09 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
3428 2019-01-06 14:29:51 2/ made up exclusively of stocks whose tickers were vowels (A,E,I,O,U,andY) It beat the market in I think 1997 not because that was a good strategy but rather because chance is a merry prankster. Many other ideas that are just as silly but don't *sound* silly also sometimes
3429 2019-01-06 14:29:04 Many a times "Hope Stocks" turnout to be a "Hopeless Investments",so don't buy any stock based on hope stories.
Lessons from history:
~ Suzlon.
~ Jain Irrigation.
~ Airtel & Idea.
~ Reliance Power.
~ DLF. etc.,

Hope is good in life but in investing  focus on Rationality.
3430 2019-01-06 14:28:50 Tell that to my bump stocks
3431 2019-01-06 14:27:38 Stocks? Don't read too much into it.  All discretionary spending stocks are in freefall, as are global equities generally.  It's a macro thing, though I'm not discounting what you're getting at, just there's more at play right now.
3432 2019-01-06 14:25:54 reason for this drop is all about future earnings which are going to be lower for longer. this is global. more QE/ZIRP will not change that. CB stimi elevated stocks, not the economies of the world. Chart chasers will fail like the economies and earn will fail. what more is there

3435 2019-01-06 14:24:39 IMO, 2nd Amdt is in jeopardy. WTO, UN & One World Order desparately want globalization, open borders, & global migration, & know they need to disarm us to accomplish it. Problem is NJ has already started by banning bump stocks. Trump has said nothing, much less try to stop it.
3436 2019-01-06 14:20:58 I find it interesting that when someone talks about common sense gun laws, they can never actually give an example of one that doesn't already exist. It's also interesting to look at all the attention the MSM gave Trump when he banned bump stocks. It was 3 minutes worth.
3437 2019-01-06 14:20:02 I never wore cortina as my parent's favorite store then was Lennards. Lennards had mother care stocks; lovely shoes and sandals.
3438 2019-01-06 14:18:33 What are the Democrats doing about this problem?  They keep complaining about the rising medical costs from a medical system they created and support.  Who are the investors that have stocks in these companies?  Democrats or people like Soros maybe, among others.  Playing 2 sides
3439 2019-01-06 14:18:24 We help clients invest in U.S. & other markets (we take investment amounts upward of USD 50K for investments in stocks and upward of USD 12K for Mutual funds). @_nirajshah a lot of of what we invested was money earned by Indian clients overseas which they preferred to keep abroad

3444 2019-01-06 14:16:05 XRP is like traditionally buying and selling stocks in businesses, technologies or ideas. Bitcoin and Litecoin are trading fiat for cash replacements. So yeah, good description. Any thoughts on the recent litecoin pump? Speculation, or the market catching up to its value?
3445 2019-01-06 14:15:41 Its insane liberal ideas such as making people pay MORE THAN HALF of their income which caused a liberal like Steve Jobs to only receive $1 per year and receive the rest in stocks as thats not taxed the same. Cheated the system to avoid paying millions in taxes. LOL.
3446 2019-01-06 14:15:28 Isn't life a gamble? Buying packs is gambling, buying stocks, also gambling, buying a car is also a gamble, what changes is the risk and reward

3455 2019-01-06 14:10:41 Agreed. We need to see some real bifurcation in prices. As long as everything is trending the same the overall bear is strong; interestingly enough, the same can be said of stocks.

3457 2019-01-06 14:08:46 Exactly my dear. Big companies like SM and YG dont have time to create and draft some silly fake relationship only for stocks to be rise in market or even for gaining attention. Jongin and Jennie are both human. Love is part of our nature

3482 2019-01-06 13:42:47 $10 million+ a year is not a salary from a single job or steady work. This kind of $ comes from investments, stocks, inheritance, real estate- passive income. So stop with the tired LIE that rich people are working so damn hard all year for the money they unethically hoard.

3496 2019-01-06 13:29:10 Correct. Let’s lift billionaires and they’ll help us. Well how did that tax cut work out for everyone? They billionaires bought back stocks and that was it. We are now faced with a trillion dollar deficit and growing.

3506 2019-01-06 13:17:01 Reinstate the ban on stock buy backs, too. Trillions that should've been spent on workers & the company are lavished on board members & top execs. Economically wasteful.  Ordinary people used to buy stocks for retirement, not wild speculation. @paulkrugman #copolitics

3516 2019-01-06 13:09:19 Until you can't get dividends on crypto, like holding stake in stocks, it is very hard to attract real interest from institutional investors. However, this can change if you will be able to get % from network effect emerging from variety of products.

3533 2019-01-06 12:52:39 Stocks up in 2019?
3534 2019-01-06 12:48:52 you can't help yourself can you dotard? Talking about the stock market when 2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008?  December the worst month for stocks since 1931? What do those dates have in common?  Economic disaster-your so called leadership is a plague on our country
3535 2019-01-06 12:48:10 
3536 2019-01-06 12:47:56 We want to force you from office because you are a danger to America and the world, not because Dems “can’t win in 2020.” 

And how is it that you take ownership of every piece of good economic news but blame others when stocks tank?
3537 2019-01-06 12:47:54 All rights are important not just #2A - pissing away freedom is a new Americon pastime. How is that executive over reach on bump stocks?
3538 2019-01-06 12:44:04 Sure you can always get your coins back. That's the way #gold certificates were supposed to work. And AFAIK the way they did work until Nixon took us of the gold standard. If you'd prefer you could consider #lightning #BTC "netting out" but that's too much like the #DTCC 4 stocks
3539 2019-01-06 12:41:30 Your quote implies that all assets are going to be taxed. This is just on yearly income. Do you know a single person making over $10 mil a year who also isn't raking it in with stocks/investments? These are the last people on earth that we should be concerned for

3544 2019-01-06 12:34:31 Apologies for the out of stock item. Due to the festive season many items did get sold out sooner than expected. Stocks should be back on our selves in the coming week.
3545 2019-01-06 12:34:01 The bump stock ban by Executive Order might run afoul of the  SCOTUS. I am not sure on this one, I think that  Trump overstepped his bounds on his deal making. The only interest I  have in bump stocks is that it has the  appearance of a "camel's nose under the tent flap."
3546 2019-01-06 12:33:12 don't worry lets trust JYP, his girls had done real well for the company and I've been seeing their stocks going up and up

3589 2019-01-06 11:57:20 Whatever they are working on it’s not based off of stocks. This game has been worked on for atleast 3 years. Bo4 is the game that first brought in a new arena. Battle royal and they killed it.
3590 2019-01-06 11:55:00 Am I meissing something. Last time I check everyone’s stocks are down. That doesn’t dictated what they do.
3591 2019-01-06 11:54:49 Does that extend to Firearm Accessories?
Like Scopes, Foregrips, and recoil-driven reciprocating stocks?
3592 2019-01-06 11:54:27 So I take it that you don’t like bo4 @General. In 3 years this is the best game they had. Iw sucked let’s jump 4 miles into the sky. And world war 2 was a good game just at the wrong time. I just don’t get how you look at stocks and that tells the story. It doesn’t.

3596 2019-01-06 11:48:33 More money in your portfolio from where? Stocks? Not this year.  And stocks went up a ton under Obama, so I’m sure you gave him credit for that too, right?
3597 2019-01-06 11:46:55 You could have taken home more if the rate wasn't 70%. I am not a fan of ideas that are unlikely to work. All that 0.3% would do is move themselves or their money abroad or receive income in stocks or something else which might 1/2

3632 2019-01-06 11:12:40 Focus on low float stocks.. They can only give explosive moves. Being a result month i assume nifty 50 stocks with good results will also move in a good manner. Thats why go for spreads.

3700 2019-01-06 09:38:01 I’m not sure u know how the markets work. The Dow has lost all its value for the entire 2018 and some of 2017.

3754 2019-01-06 08:20:52 Bro, how are you filtering the stocks? Screener?

3756 2019-01-06 08:17:53 Oh so that's why those stocks were showing the volatility of AMD and SQ. LoL. That's what I get for only looking at charts
3757 2019-01-06 08:16:46 I have no idea whether that would work. Doubt it. My first idea would be that there should be processes in place when someone tries to deliver physical stocks and bonds. Should fall under various regulations for money laundering.
3758 2019-01-06 08:12:42 The big question for the #stockmarket is?
Will it be crashing further or not?
When it will crash hard & we get a liquidity crisis, all stocks will go down. Even the most #undervalued stocks in the #gold #silver #uranium and #commodity space. It will be a huge #opportunity to buy
3759 2019-01-06 08:11:05 Anyone interested with ARMY BOMB VER.3? May onhand sakin kaya lang ang mahal sweeties waaa nung nakaraan nasa 3,100 lang ngayon 3,500 na nakakaiyak talaga nagmahal daw kasi panibagong stocks. If meron may gusto DM na lang ako, mabilis pa din maubos kahit mahal eh.

3760 2019-01-06 08:06:44 It means you have to learn on your own by reading books, magazines, etc. and researching yourself. Nobody is going to tell you how to find great stocks. You have to observe the greats and learn then refine your process accordingly.

3772 2019-01-06 07:43:35 stocks rise by 1%.
3773 2019-01-06 07:41:09 Maybe because they don't ask questions when someone crops up with a suitcase full of stocks and bonds in physical form, which should be highly suspicious? But then why would they have to sell them deliver them in Russia, too? That would work. Securities would be like cash.
3774 2019-01-06 07:39:47 FUCK APPLE!!! There trash ass products no wonder there stocks are going down...all went down hill since steve jobs died
3775 2019-01-06 07:38:24 It’s Obama fault he put a cap on CEO pay so they just gave it in stocks. Invested stocks are paid out after a time in the contract is fulfilled. Passing the unconstitutional act of Obama care made the healthcare industry billions from middle America paying your socialist ideas
3776 2019-01-06 07:34:55 capping pay wouldn't do much, companies would start paying executives in stocks. Raising taxes is good, but we also need to raise capital gains tax to match income tax and adjust it for inflation.

3805 2019-01-06 06:49:21 The 2nd negative part on sales, stocks is again propaganda. These writers put this crap in2 every1s minds so stocks slow, retail shopping drps.

3818 2019-01-06 06:34:19 I think so, future is going to be like this
Select your sector and stocks v well, get in at best valuations and wait for big upsides

Kept out of this sector for many months now.
3821 2019-01-06 06:28:02 Sigh - you can keep being semantic if you want.  We both know what I mean and it’s the reason that bump stocks have been made illegal - they are a ‘workaround’ that make a legal weapon fire bullets like an illegal one - negating the difference between them 
3822 2019-01-06 06:25:55 Simple. Be poor like me and don't have money for stocks.
3823 2019-01-06 06:24:45 I am for free trade. I don’t support Trump’s trade war.
The DOW regained 847 points on Friday. With your degree in Econ, you should know how well the economy is doing. Stocks always fluctuate. They don’t grow to infinity.
Do you read Friday’s jobs report? What was it?
What’s GDP?
3824 2019-01-06 06:23:33 However, 2018 as a whole was the worst ever year for U.S. stocks in a decade. 

Where's the tweet about that, Donny Boy?
3825 2019-01-06 06:22:18 One of the scary things about the internet and scam artists is that reading the comments on youtube/reddit/instagram/twitter they look legit. B/c they buy comments. So if you know nothing about stocks like most people, and want to dive in you get scammed easy

3832 2019-01-06 06:08:30 Second, the losses on loans and declines in equity assoc. w these stocks is already working its way through the system. The logic of short-selling for individuals is that a stock down 50% can go down another 50%, but for "the market" or "the system," that's smaller and smaller.

3835 2019-01-06 06:05:24 I've worked really hard shorting stocks the last year, and all 3 classes (frauds, fads and "failures") are down a lot right now. The most aggressively bearish thing you can say is QE pumped up the amount of debt shoveled into "failures," and you know what? I just don't see it.
3836 2019-01-06 06:01:06 I do not have an entire pack dedicated to nature stocks  that could be something I may do in the future though.

3839 2019-01-06 05:59:36 Nope, it wasn’t because of the tax break. They could’ve done that anytime they wanted to. And what do you think of the companies that instead bought back stocks or closed down businesses? The fact is that Trump is a colossal fraud

3845 2019-01-06 05:58:15 Gotta do your research. The numbers I used were based off the S&P 500 index fund. But you have to do your hw and find which type of stocks or real estate is best for you.

The closest he's come to being a builder is wearing a hard-hat. He scams money and pay builders to build his projects, and pay others to oversee them.
3872 2019-01-06 05:30:07 Tried hard to spend money at Real Groovy today but left empty handed after 2 hours & listening to ~30 records. Second hand stocks seemed a bit slim, plus I'm picky.

3878 2019-01-06 05:21:24 I think the great secret of the world is making up some imaginary currency (metal discs, stocks, etc.) and convincing people to give you actual goods for that currency.

3881 2019-01-06 05:17:58 Well if you’re a fan of currency, have I got a treat for you. Stocks! So you give me metal discs, and I give you some paper, and then you get to trade that paper later...maybe it will get you more discs, maybe not. That’s the fun!!!
3882 2019-01-06 05:16:37 This analysis doesn't make sense! Liquid cash is not used to judge the wealth of a man. Assets and investments is wat is used. Stocks, bonds, properties. Money is a currency its not stable so its never called an asset. Dangote will most likely b number 20 wen don wit d refinery
3883 2019-01-06 05:14:49 Stocks in the company even after we finish working there, we even get tuition paid for, we can transfer anywhere in the country if we have to move somewhere else, and the longer we stay in the company, the more opportunities we get. We are even getting raises. The pay was above
3884 2019-01-06 05:14:13 Not necessarily. While losing the invincibility does stink, the main purpose of Input Shoryuken back in 4 was it's extremely high kill power instead of being a reversal, as the move was known to take stocks at around 75% against most of the cast.
3885 2019-01-06 05:11:43 Sports gambling is a lot like the stock market honestly. “Oh I shorted stocks because I thought the market would fall” Yeah well I really thought Kansas would win today
3886 2019-01-06 05:08:00 Pubs have done this giving very rich huge sums ofsince 81 Reagan& we are in deathwatch now as Bush&Trump did same.All those uncollected taxes now 22trillion National Debt.Nothing works in this Debt environment& if dollar collapse’s stocks& houses will decrease 70%
3887 2019-01-06 05:06:32 Previously mentioned, and Again: Bullish $DNR (oil) and $CRMD
Also, $NCTY $JG - Bullish Chinese stocks..
3888 2019-01-06 05:06:30 Doesn't include their company, dividends, stocks or his book royalties either.
3889 2019-01-06 05:06:20 Honestly, conservatives still pretend the rich spend 100% of their tax cut in the US. How will our economy benefit from buying foreign stocks and bonds?

3891 2019-01-06 05:04:30 @bigBIOboom I don’t buy stocks under 2 dollars pretty much as a rule with few exceptions!
3892 2019-01-06 05:03:18 real estate is worse because they can depreciate property that is going up in value.  And with stocks, heirs get the basis of what the stock is worth when they inherit, so decades of capital gains by the deceased are never taxed.
3893 2019-01-06 05:02:29 Ubos na stocks on hand, pre-order na yung iba 
3894 2019-01-06 05:01:12 Stocks in News Reliance Home Finance has completed repayment of interest on non-convertible debentures of Rs 273 crore.

Reliance Industries: RBI has approved its application for proposed amalgamation of Reliance Holding USA with Reliance Energy Generation & Distribution.
3895 2019-01-06 05:00:13 Such a load of BS. YOU and your Republican colleagues voted for the corporate tax cuts, adding $77B to the deficit within ONE year. These companies reinvested into the company by padding their stocks and satisfying their shareholders while laying off thousands of employees.
3896 2019-01-06 04:59:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3897 2019-01-06 04:58:57 Lana, U seem like a hard worker, underpaid like o many. I salute U! But isn't ZIRP like today's NINJA of ~2006? ZIRP drives folks to stocks & housing, creating bubbles. When bubbles crash, non-savers R hit the hardest as they have no cushion. So I don't like ZIRP. C my point?
3898 2019-01-06 04:58:31 Costco... the place you go if you want to big up your anger stocks in readiness for a mass shooting. Seriously people pull over to the left & learn how the fuck to drive the trolleys! 
3899 2019-01-06 04:57:38 Cheaper stock prices so when they do get a big hit you can sell the stocks for slightly more than you paid for and you can profit
3900 2019-01-06 04:55:42 Live betting is like day trading stocks.  Just have to have the discipline to stay away if odds aren’t going the way u want.
3901 2019-01-06 04:53:38 Hey Steve not many people in the real world have 10 million or above to get the 70% tax  she talking about but the GOP and their corporations. Remember the tax cut u gave to the rich the ones that bought back stocks. Yea those ones.  Devil has a seat for u in hell
3902 2019-01-06 04:53:02 Phil Spencer didn’t really take over until September 2017. As soon as MS finally gave him the check book he stocks Xbox Divison with ton talent and bright future.
3903 2019-01-06 04:52:22 LOL!! While Stocks plummet, more than 8 Thousand being held hostage from their jobs. False employment stats. 

Oh yeah, we see how it's all gravy. Next.

3905 2019-01-06 04:51:53 Dovish Fed, Deal with China, more buybacks, and stocks will be off and running again. All the headwinds are things that can be easily solved.

3909 2019-01-06 04:48:47 #24 and #23: Wealthy by way of stocks in a tech company. Capital gains from the sale of stocks are taxed at 30% in Sweden. This is higher than in the US, but only by 10% and so are probably not egregious considering the benefits offered by living in Sweden.
3910 2019-01-06 04:48:24 Unemployment is at an all time low, stocks are up, economy is booming, pulled some troops home and more....yet you talk nonsense.  What have you done for this country????
3911 2019-01-06 04:48:00 Trump blamed recent stock market sell-off on the fact that the Dems took control of the House. In Oct, Trump blamed Dems for market turbulence. He has also blamed the Fed Reserve or a "glitch" for recent troubles with the stock market, while claiming credit when stocks are up.
3912 2019-01-06 04:45:28 very true!  ten stocks holding up the index ,
3913 2019-01-06 04:44:43 Agreed it's mostly speculators driving junior mining stocks now and most times @Mintgecko. They are the ones who transact in those stocks!
3914 2019-01-06 04:40:00 I must be the sucker at the table. G7 stocks?
3915 2019-01-06 04:39:34 But she stocks money she cajoled her indoctrinated faithful followers to pledge. She openly declared her ambition to buy her own Jets soonest. Will she not stock up to Billions needed to pay for her jets?

A pokemon with 20 years of experience in fighting games and the ability to delete stocks while literally sleeping on you

Or one long whippy boi
3919 2019-01-06 04:33:32 They’ve sold their soul no different than the tobacco companies same investors I’m sure. My warning to all putting your money into pot stocks. You a Hypocrites be ashamed of yourselves. Making a profit this way is so wrong.Greed before welfare of others THC destroys character
3920 2019-01-06 04:32:18 And the people that freelance in expensive areas like LA are totally screwed. 

When pharma, insurance and hospital stocks went higher right after the details of the ACA were released, that was all you needed to know.
3921 2019-01-06 04:31:23 I even opened my own investment portfolio, picked my own stocks, and am making small, but significant gains. Crazy that you can just buy stock and make money just by how the market grows!
3922 2019-01-06 04:29:30 Wtf r u losing your money and mind?
Or did u take fentanyl that was brought to Vancouver from China , that money went to capital in weed stocks and real estate investments?
3923 2019-01-06 04:28:59 After all, if they cannot make 10-20% ROI business, they might as well buy other assets (real estate, stocks, etc.).
3924 2019-01-06 04:26:55 $10,000 and then I would invest some into stocks. I would travel too!

3927 2019-01-06 04:18:59 One stocks save my stock losses ;) Awesome last year long term play with PXP Energy Corporation.

Last year strategy works. We'll try out Real Estate and a Bank this year.
3928 2019-01-06 04:18:19 Cool.  I'm a trader, not a short.  I long, neutral,  and short many stocks.

If tsla goes to 2000, great.  If it goes to 20, great.

In fact, substitute any stock ticker.

Holding any bias to any stock is not trading.  And good way to get punked.
3929 2019-01-06 04:17:59 OMG for the 100th time congress needs to approve trade deals till then your Cold War with China is tanking stocks.
3930 2019-01-06 04:17:47 Watch out for JJ Silver Jewelry's coming flash deal this January 11, 2019 with super low prices. Limited stocks only.

3931 2019-01-06 04:17:41 @Tradereversal do you have any favorite volital stocks you particularly follow or a core set of volital stocks?
3932 2019-01-06 04:16:07 I can't wait until they tax the shit out of em.. Tax the crap out of income from stocks above 100k.
3933 2019-01-06 04:14:47 Stocks went way up during Obama’s presidency. If your investments took off as soon as Trump was elected I assume you are heavily leveraged in white sheets and tiki torches.
3934 2019-01-06 04:13:19 Yep lol all the time you get some good tips on some stocks sometimes.
3935 2019-01-06 04:13:02 Lol, then why does he boast WIN when it's doing well? He does affect the stocks, you need an education. His tariff b.s. caused a huge rift in stocks, ones that thrived before him. Safe options. Imagine complicated ones. As far as Ron Paul's b.s. I won't read it.
3936 2019-01-06 04:11:03 Polls show 62% approve your impeachment. Your approval rating is consistently  for shit . Stocks tanking ,farmers declaring bankruptcy at alarming rates .YOU ARE A FAILURE AND A TRAITOR !!
3937 2019-01-06 04:07:39 And stocks down for the year.
3938 2019-01-06 04:07:18 I just found out that the boyz is in the latest issue of sparkling mag and I'm literally going to the mall as soon as i finished taking my tasks at home. Hoping that they have stocks there
3939 2019-01-06 04:07:13 Been learning a little about stocks but not enough tho.
3940 2019-01-06 04:05:06 $30T off stocks, $2T on Fed Debt, increasing TD, 800k - no pay, increasing instability, fixated on nonsense & foreign dictators.

It's time to go my fraudulent little grifter

3945 2019-01-06 03:57:24 Mostly, her husband leverages her position - kind of like the Clintons.... a lot of inside information on stocks too. Has led to mansions in San Francisco, Napa Valley, DC, and tens of millions of wealth.

2. Use China to stop Jihad. 
3. Unite Mongoloid stocks for Mongoloid continent. 
4. Rigidity of Chinese nationalism can protect Asia against flexible and Inimical Nation States.
3947 2019-01-06 03:56:00 The big layoffs are coming and of course you are counting the unpaid and furloughed govt employees as employed, probably counting them a second time if they had to get another job to pay the bills. Don't get too excited, Donnie said the same about stocks and how did that work out

Full sets : The 1st supplier I found gave all the secured stocks to those who paid first. Given na yun really, since ubusan na talaga ng SG. I found another supplier but the DOP is very early w/c is on 01/09.
3950 2019-01-06 03:54:04 Stocks?
3951 2019-01-06 03:53:50 Non, il y en a trop qui restent anonymes, comme ceux qui balancent les grenades, les lacrimos, et usent des flash ball en blessant très gravement de pauvres gens ! Vous avez même épuisé les stocks de munitions, c'est tout  dire...
3952 2019-01-06 03:53:40 I think they did let the remaining stocks be used. We could still order it in the hosp., but couldn't write OP's for it.
3953 2019-01-06 03:52:46 Stocks are not doing well...2018 was worse than previous.
3954 2019-01-06 03:52:41 as bad as we normally think it is. The ones that take the brunt of recessions are actually the extremely high earners, and I’d rather them be exposed to the risk of having too much overvalued stocks than the middle class.
3955 2019-01-06 03:51:36 Hoarding money though? Do you really believe that?  

No, they're not into stocks or investment at all, are they? 

The worst thing billionaires do is lobby politicians. Sound like a complicated problem? Nah. Just abolish polititians. Problem solved.
3956 2019-01-06 03:51:35 is why we’ve had so many bubbles in recent years). Basically the top earners (who get much of their income/wealth from stocks) aren’t actually worth as much as we think they’re worth. I do think we could redistribute some of the wealth but I also don’t think it’s
3957 2019-01-06 03:51:14 Get her to put her money into stocks Reef. I am concerned.

3959 2019-01-06 03:49:37 the middle class in America also makes them you see that we actually make more/get more than European countries (except for Luxembourg). So our middle class is strong, but our top percent is just insanely high (and I think that’s bc US stocks are actually overvalued which
3960 2019-01-06 03:46:47 Market will turn and go down 15%.  Feds will continue to raise rates.  We are heading for a recession. It is time to buy a short position to protect your stocks.
