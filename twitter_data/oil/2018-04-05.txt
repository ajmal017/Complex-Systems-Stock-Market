11 2018-04-05 23:58:46 You can also place some coconut oil in the warmer then add a few drops of the oils. That’s what I usually do instead of the water.

That is the "big poker hand": "Tomorrow, all our energy partners will take CNY for oil, greatly reducing our need for USD"...

35 2018-04-05 23:57:57 Omggggg use a small amount of Extra Virgin Olive Oil after washing, morning and night. Let it soak and leave it.

Nothing more, it is like a miracleeeeeeeeeeeeeee! My skin is oily naturally and it is amazing, never been better!
36 2018-04-05 23:57:54 I mean, you haven’t even been able to defend why oil is better. You just keep saying you want oil because you like it better, but there doesn’t appear to be a reason.
37 2018-04-05 23:57:49 have to defend our men while we still have them left! ;)

48 2018-04-05 23:56:18 I love my iron skillet so much, when I clean it up and oil it, I get a sense of pride and accomplishment. That ain't know joke either!
49 2018-04-05 23:55:53 It is not important You can do it
 The kingdom of Saudi Arabia It has a huge economy
And significant resources other than oil

51 2018-04-05 23:55:43 The discount on oil is because we can only sell it to the US.
52 2018-04-05 23:55:41 I used a sample of the phyto oil and I’m in love 
53 2018-04-05 23:55:40 @kilmeade coal comp. investing  oil extraction from coal plant in Ashland Kentucky 41% increase oil production
54 2018-04-05 23:55:37 The US departure from Syria allows the Russians to win in Syria and establish hegemony in the region. Remember their adventure in Afghanistan? They want the oil and natural gas.
55 2018-04-05 23:55:01 But what can we do? I have seen suggestions of fining the Big Oil companies, but what would happen to the commute of hundreds of millions in the USA if 2/5 of the big 5 oil companies decided to stop selling their wares to us?
56 2018-04-05 23:54:56 LAW has to be changed before anyone can LEGALLY SELL medicinal cannabis. If Tony Bower was SELLING med cannabis oil to the 150 desperately ill kids, then he was breaking the law. Or was he providing the oil for free? Any form of selling is dealing. At least it's in the spotlight.

60 2018-04-05 23:54:07 Zinke and Trump haven't done jack diddly squat for conservation. All they have done is endanger our national treasures to appease the oil and gas industry. That is corruption of the highest magnitude.
61 2018-04-05 23:54:05 Just as Bahrain discovered a huge reserve of oil.

63 2018-04-05 23:54:02 Proof that no matter what nonsense I spout, my next oil change is not due until AFTER the odometer rolls over to zero.
64 2018-04-05 23:53:13 To be fair, just one side of my nose has more oil than all that. :p
65 2018-04-05 23:53:08 Kevin Lowe is and always will be an Oiler. His dedication to this team since the very beginning should never be questioned. Had the Oil of won in 2006 #4 would be in the rafters. IMO still should be.
66 2018-04-05 23:53:00 Did you disinfectant the remote?
67 2018-04-05 23:52:51 The question I have is if we don't vote for the liberal since they seem to have no backbone and cower to the oil companies, but what about the conservatives? They are no better. We need a plan to get rid of these old dinosaurs and not get another older dinosaur
68 2018-04-05 23:52:48 I’m just happy that I can spend on oil paint now like that it is a huge deal. like I tried painting with acrylic the other day and I felt weird mnnn
69 2018-04-05 23:52:44 To drill in #ANWR would be to exchange an immense holiness for a bowl of oil.

73 2018-04-05 23:52:08 In a poor state, the teaching crisis in Oklamhoma would be bad enough, but in oil/gas rich Oklahoma it is a disgrace. The children are our future. The teachers help them get there.
74 2018-04-05 23:52:06 I think it's good that US get out of the middle east, aint nothing but opioids and oil there! Wondering why the deep state wants to be there hmmmmmmm...

76 2018-04-05 23:51:51 All presidents are the same president! Greyhound buses don’t run on gasoline, they run on melted greyhound dogs! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
77 2018-04-05 23:51:51 No cause they’re too busy fundraising from big pharma, insurance companies, Wall Street and oil/gas companies #centrism
78 2018-04-05 23:51:50 But Russia doesn't have any business except corruption and oil. That's why your economy is in such bad shape with oligarchs and a president moving money out of your country. Grifting appears to be the business model. Try again boys.

87 2018-04-05 23:50:58 anyone who tells you to put coconut oil on your face secretly hates you and wishes the worst for you
88 2018-04-05 23:50:55 Well the poor workers served their purpose to the oil companies and then got let go so the executives and shareholders could have nice bonuses and share buy-backs because it all about profits. They don't give 2 shits about our people or beautiful province

93 2018-04-05 23:50:34 We have had the oil wars, next is the water wars,followed by corporate buying out of all major water supplies.
94 2018-04-05 23:50:22 I love how these wealthy people are also cheapskate. Of course in this case it was all for show anyway. The lobbyist would’ve probably paid Scott Pruitt to stay in his place. Russian Oil exec, would’ve probably provided entertainment as well.

110 2018-04-05 23:47:22 The tragedy is that "oil imports to Canada don't have to meet the same environmental standards as our own oil production."  Yes, precisely.  Canada is a leader in environmentalism, even if not enough.
111 2018-04-05 23:47:15 An EPA emergency? Like an oil spill?
112 2018-04-05 23:47:09 ...predictable. Tomorrow at 6 he’s gonna be tweet fired (twired?) and replaces with a barrel of oil that feels lonely.

116 2018-04-05 23:46:47 Exactly, Big Oil doesn't want us to save money at the pump. The White House has never been more corrupt then it is now.

120 2018-04-05 23:45:41 Topical Magnesium oil is a good alternative you have to to get wet or eat anything! If you're deficient is stings like a bi*ch but the more you use it the less is stings. Basically less burning / stinging if your levels are higher.
121 2018-04-05 23:45:27 Why would anyone want more gas guzzlers, more dependence on foreign oil, more pollution......I just don’t get it.

125 2018-04-05 23:45:16 @GovMaryFallin This state will so better off when your condescending ass is gone. Why do we pay so much taxes for nothing here? Why are we not TAXING big OIL in Oklahoma? You crooked old has been. TAX BIG OIL and stop killing us with their burden.

156 2018-04-05 23:41:00 Love me some Rih and I been supporting the fenty beauty but sis I ain’t getting that body shimmer, oil lotion or whatever it is
157 2018-04-05 23:40:48 Because they take contributions from polluters - coal & oil
158 2018-04-05 23:40:34 He lied about how much oil we actually imported, he lied about his donations, he lied about doubling our exports, lied about regulations, lied about fast and furious,lied about setting the red line, lied about health care repeatedly, lied about the production of steal. Etc.
159 2018-04-05 23:40:31 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
160 2018-04-05 23:40:31 Isha already white ain't gone make much difference she don't need oil anyway

164 2018-04-05 23:39:54 you gotta switch the alcohol for some good indica oil bruh
165 2018-04-05 23:39:33 slavery was a national policy in Civ IV, but in Civ V, you just order around workers with no autonomy who don't get paid despite spending six thousand years building mines, farms, trade posts, roads, lumber mills, hunting camps, oil wells, fishing boats, offshore platforms...
166 2018-04-05 23:39:31 Most likely a new oil change, or a Perfect Cherry Blossom. (Touhou fans)
167 2018-04-05 23:39:29 Yeah it’s a soy based oil! They’re listed as vegan according to olive garden’s allergen menu :)
168 2018-04-05 23:39:23 Lozan, So what you are saying is that you are ok killing foreign Gays so you can get paid by Tides to protest Canada’s Gay friendly Oil. See you at Pride this year. Likely, you will take a pass.
169 2018-04-05 23:39:21 これはコーヒーも怖くなりそうですねーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
170 2018-04-05 23:38:50 So it looks like letting @jiffylube do anything beyond oil changes is not a good idea. They replace an air filter & my car now has THREE lights that indicate they knocked off a rubber hose while doing so. NOT happy - and of course they didn't answer 3min after 7 when it happened

179 2018-04-05 23:37:44 can I buy an oil diffuser that smells like subways freshly baked bread
180 2018-04-05 23:37:42 I remember them days before i go to school granny use to get the oil and put a cross on my head while praying for me
181 2018-04-05 23:37:37 Trust me I think it’s great of you to want to boycott palm oil, I used to tell people it wasn’t vegan and to aviod it too! But the thing that is going to continue to make veganism grow at the rate it is accessibility!

184 2018-04-05 23:37:25 Who said sum bout some oil bitch you cooking?
185 2018-04-05 23:37:17 Oil level 100
186 2018-04-05 23:37:13 Wow. Come thru avocado oil. My skin is glowing
187 2018-04-05 23:37:09 Wow a whole $280k ! Ding dong spent that on a holiday ! So there was at least one person involved in the investigation... not from Alberta or ever been to Alberta.. or have ever had anything to do with oil and gas !! Just used Wikipedia for facts.
188 2018-04-05 23:36:49 have been trying to figure out what [variable X]'s perfume is because it smells really nice and Signature-Scent recognizable and the woman next to me at Neighborhood Bar was wearing it so i asked her and of course it's a geranium-based essential oil sold in organic co-ops
189 2018-04-05 23:36:40 The ultimate snake oil salesman
190 2018-04-05 23:36:37 Got car with oil change notification, tried to swap out at 3 locations, got 3 denials. Way to treat an Enterprise Plus Platinum member.

191 2018-04-05 23:36:35 “... Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.” Psalm 23: 5-6
192 2018-04-05 23:36:13 I took my car for an oil change and they told me 'We'll wash your car for you after the oil change and have it ready and clean when you pick it up' ...
193 2018-04-05 23:35:55 I assumed everyone bought olive oil in bulk
194 2018-04-05 23:35:53 It doesn't have to do with wages but the amount of work total. If your insitu program can't produce more because there's no room in pipelines then they aren't going to drill. Not just SAGD, but even the light ends produced in western Alberta that essential to produce oil sands.
195 2018-04-05 23:35:44 Turn it down oil is expensive
196 2018-04-05 23:35:22 Not sure I understand the reason. We can’t get oil to market to save our lives (or our economy)
197 2018-04-05 23:35:21 So basically, when attendance declines and the parks become unprofitable, then Drumpf will have the ‘legitimacy’ behind opening them up to oil drilling and environmental decimation.

199 2018-04-05 23:34:40 TRUMP wants to give the gift of Syria to Putin-
Syria is strategic to Middle East oil production & sits near Strait of Hormuz-choke point from Persian gulf to open ocean
Even Saudi’s ask Trump not to pull out-
Our General’s same-
Kurds-our partner in destroying ISIS will all die
200 2018-04-05 23:34:38 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
201 2018-04-05 23:34:38 Rand Paul turns his back on Pruitt’s gross corruption while cheering Pruitt’s actions on behalf of the oil & gas industry and chemical company polluters.

205 2018-04-05 23:34:00 I guess I’ll go get my oil changed tomorrow since it was due for one in January 
206 2018-04-05 23:33:58 ww
207 2018-04-05 23:33:57 Its actually upsetting how good snapchat filters make me look cause now I know what the ideal me would look like but my fucking face oil wont let me
208 2018-04-05 23:33:55 Budget Cuts CON said reason for increase in stabbings. Can CON say MIGRANTS or INVADERS? NOW. LET'S MIX OIL WITH WATER. THAT SHOULD FIX IT. WHAT A CON/Khan WOULD SAY......
209 2018-04-05 23:33:53 The funds are in total disbelief tonight..they were probably trying to close oil above 64 for the week:)
210 2018-04-05 23:33:37 not sure if anyone has this plan yet..but if you can subsidize hardest hit people and sectors (oil, etc.) to transition green...like paid training for workers learning green tech...then instead of bankrupting these intelligent people, you are applying their skills in a new way
211 2018-04-05 23:33:22 The lamps they used here were large dome-shaped torches, fueled by rags soaked in oil and used for walking outside. With extra containers of oil–symbolizing vessels containing nothing else except the oil of the presence of God
212 2018-04-05 23:33:20 I am doing a daily live oil educational fb class @ 6pm 
Stay tuned!
213 2018-04-05 23:33:12 You have to understand that asking people not not only give up animals products but to then also not consume over half of the products they would use to replace those animal products because of palm oil would cause a lot of people to not want to go vegan!
214 2018-04-05 23:33:09 Stay strong and you are correct hormones do disrupt I hope you find a solution soon just keep looking I started the cbd oil it’s working try looking into that if you haven’t already I was lucky I found it i think I was close to my limit

Is in the oil companies' pay
It's their house that he rents
For about fifty cents
Where he lays and lies all the day
216 2018-04-05 23:32:59 I jokingly asked my brother if he would buy me rosehip oil as a birthday present...not only did he do it but he bought me two bottles 
217 2018-04-05 23:32:59 The Holy Spirit is like a fuel, or the oil for the fire of God’s presence in our lives. Like the ten virgins in Matthew 25:1-13. Some had enough oil to keep their fire burning and the others did not.
218 2018-04-05 23:32:55 young innocent 2016 finn is the best finn. 2018 is dumb and smells like puberty and motor oil
219 2018-04-05 23:32:47 This is nothing new. Trump has the right hunches, and hope he follows through on his promise of stopping support to Wahabi Sunni crimnal groups in Syria, preventing another million deaths. He should ignore Saudis, oil lobby and Israeli lobby. They do not care beyond their myopia.
220 2018-04-05 23:32:45 i heard rose hip oil is hella good too tho but ima get like everything cos I do not want no stretch marks lmaoooo it’s life tho 
221 2018-04-05 23:32:45 The next mf that tell me “older vehicles are suppose to use thicker oil” is gonna get rko’d
222 2018-04-05 23:32:34 Really just had to pay $974 to change my fuckin oil pump
223 2018-04-05 23:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
224 2018-04-05 23:31:58 This definitely seems like an issue you need to worry about

226 2018-04-05 23:31:50 It's not what we bought it's what we're gonna pay with Spanky's plan.  A Snake Oil Salesman is a Snake Oil Salesman, you never trust one.  You're loving his koolaid now, but it'll turn out to be turpentine and you'll be sorry!
227 2018-04-05 23:31:44 Exactly. The public wants to know that you care. Organizations that haven't shown empathy -- such as BP during its oil spill or United Airlines when the passenger was dragged off the plane -- have suffered consequences! #ValenciaPRChat
228 2018-04-05 23:31:35 Damn TSA stopped me for my coconut hair oil lol
229 2018-04-05 23:31:29 Check out the new window display at the foreclosed barber. It's full of Namibian bottles of oil.

233 2018-04-05 23:30:35 Spending the day slowly seasoning a carbon steel pan with flaxseed oil. My house already smells like Omega-3. I have 18 more layers to go...
234 2018-04-05 23:30:25 This is why the @CMEGroup needs to expand grain trading hours to match Oil, Gold, Silver Futures!
235 2018-04-05 23:30:14 Love the smell of my place lol. Baby oil candles, some lotus incense, and a lil hint of herb.

TOPIC: RELEVANCE OF VESSELS IRRESPECTIVE OF CONTENT – 3 

TEXT:  2KINGS 4:1-7

Golden Verse: “Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, as each is filled, put it to one side” 2kings 4:4
241 2018-04-05 23:29:52 I’ve gotten samples of their full temp up and down lines! so far only tried the mist toner (just as good as the essence toner) and the oil (great but not my favourite in this humidity)
242 2018-04-05 23:29:46 Started using vitamin E oil hoping it will help me with my acne scars and hyper pigmentation. 
243 2018-04-05 23:29:37 Oil well pumps, drill rigs, coal trucks, earth movers in front of every national park, monument forest service or other public land sign.
244 2018-04-05 23:29:29 Putting a lot of miles on the car this week on the radio tour... might need an oil change 
245 2018-04-05 23:29:24 Because these species live on/near/in places that can be monetized: OIL. TIMBER. COAL. 
If Reagan hadn't undone Carter's alt-energy initiatives we'd all be driving,heating, cooling GREEN & be the global leader in a green economy. Also: the planet wouldnt be frying, then drowning.
246 2018-04-05 23:29:18 If you are a true environmentalist, throw out everything you currently own, and abandon your home. It all there only because of the oil and gas industry. How do you think everything gets to it's destination, or manufactured?
247 2018-04-05 23:29:16 If I understand correctly: trump & followers want no immigrat. no trade & no environ. regs. They do want to reg. women & reproductive organs, minorities, Religion & wars if we take foreign oil. Costs to be met by higher taxes for middle class & below and limited voting rights.
248 2018-04-05 23:29:10 The transition off oil will not be painless.  If electric cars don’t replace gas, urban sprawl is massive mis-investment.
249 2018-04-05 23:29:08 Can you rub some oil in my back
250 2018-04-05 23:29:03 No, you should understand the fact that if we want more people to go vegan we can’t tell people to boycott palm oil! Because it’s literally in so many things that don’t contain animal products that potential future vegans would use to replace eating animals!
251 2018-04-05 23:28:52 I’ve fiddled around with bits of uncut gem cordierite (iolite, to gem enthusiasts) and, yes, the effect is fairly obvious.

OILIEST anagrams to IOLITES, so in my Scrabble-tournament days I put iolites in tiny vials of oil... about three people appreciated that...
252 2018-04-05 23:28:49 Yes this is pretty well known: major health effects of eating fish, not so much taking fish oil as a supplement.
253 2018-04-05 23:28:16 Drake and peppermint oil...lemme get in my zone 
254 2018-04-05 23:28:10 I am going to Rub my kids down in coconut oil every night!
255 2018-04-05 23:28:00 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
256 2018-04-05 23:27:59 Get bio oil
257 2018-04-05 23:27:57 The good tea tree oil though like the 12 dollar kind
258 2018-04-05 23:27:48 Do you use a foaming face wash, it might be drying out your skin which makes you produce even MOAR oil. Or dehydrated skin doing the same thing
259 2018-04-05 23:27:44 saw #USAvMEX trending and was hoping we were invading, taking the oil and occupying the beaches; turns it is some Eurofem ball game.
260 2018-04-05 23:27:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
261 2018-04-05 23:27:20 Tea tree oil after shaving is legit the best thing ever I wished I knew about it earlier in life
262 2018-04-05 23:27:13 Also, blaming layoffs in Calgary because of carbon tax while ignoring the collapse in oil price is nonsense. But the CPC and UCP are going all in on that, and frankly I think it's going to work in Alberta. People need someone to point a finger at.
263 2018-04-05 23:27:11 He needs those to entertain his oil and coal lobbyists, he can’t look like someone without power.
Donald’s team spends money like they have no limits, yet they are demanding these departments to make huge cuts. 
How about we get rid of them
264 2018-04-05 23:27:05 En sus manos

Rockefeller was a robber baron,a natural-born monopolist and America’s first billionaire.
He controlled 90% of oil refineries in the U.S. by the turn on the 20th century, through his Standard Oil co.,which was later on divided up to become Chevron, Mobil, Exxon,etc.
265 2018-04-05 23:27:02 I’m not the biggggest fan of the way this shimmery body oil smells. It’s not bad at all. There were just two options and I didn’t know what either smelled like and upon picking this one i want the other one lmao. But this deadass not bad. Just not how ~eye~ like to smell lol
266 2018-04-05 23:27:02 治療的な感じですです。
どうせならプラチナドラゴンとかいうかっこいいのになりたい
267 2018-04-05 23:26:59 top of the shale oil league? that wasteful exploitation of the last of the oil resources? Change course? like to continue the high impact, wasteful drainage of the earth resouces, pollution, CO2 emissions and the completely unhealthy and destructive lifestyle of the 60s????
268 2018-04-05 23:26:39 Ooof, there's alot going in this video. Like all politicians shes going heavy on exaggeration and oversimplification to make her point. I don't agree that the emission cap limits the growth of oil sands, but I'm also not a fan of the carbon tax. She seems to lump those into one.
269 2018-04-05 23:26:34 And take the oil!
270 2018-04-05 23:26:26 Oil change, hair, nails, bills etc....all tomorrow 
271 2018-04-05 23:26:09 Ndp government didn't drop the price of oil by $55 a barrel so you can hop off that merry go round
272 2018-04-05 23:26:08 They have oil subsidies, though.  That's more important to the parents, than their children are!
273 2018-04-05 23:25:55 #ThursdayTidbit It’s so easy to overlook simple pleasures until you do without. Matzah sandwiches, matzah pasta and matzah dipped in oil are just not cutting it.
274 2018-04-05 23:25:47 Lemon juice or Murphy's Oil Soap will work too.
275 2018-04-05 23:25:45 @BonAppRSVP Tony D’s Italian restaurant in New London CT has the most amazing olive oil layer cake, with lemon ricotta filling between the layers. Could you request the recipe? Grazie mille!
276 2018-04-05 23:25:41 Nothing wrong with some la oil lol
277 2018-04-05 23:25:36 たしかにご年配方におそ松くんとか描いたら喜んだりとかするのかもしれないけどさ……
278 2018-04-05 23:25:33 The 2010s will be remembered as the age of snake oil.
279 2018-04-05 23:25:28 @ColoColo Fuck off this shit, win this or delete your team.
280 2018-04-05 23:25:26 When the "oil money" begins to flow the GOJ can build new and modern hospitals and other needed infrastructure ... 

but until then the GOJ should rid itself of all non essential agencies and assets.
281 2018-04-05 23:25:20 Tell the world about the secret space program and arrest the elite’s, the intelligence agencies and tell the truth about 911 Enforce the constitution, power to the people. We all know we are being lied to by fake news to mind control us. We are waking up! Free energy! Big oil bad
282 2018-04-05 23:25:19 Update: I've officially tried everything including castor oil and this baby is not coming on her own. I'm depressed af
283 2018-04-05 23:25:19 Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
284 2018-04-05 23:25:01 I will because your oil, gas and coal pollute MY air and MY drinking water. Keep them in the ground.
285 2018-04-05 23:24:50 The one without oil rigs.
286 2018-04-05 23:24:44 If they wanted only the oil they would invade venezuela first
287 2018-04-05 23:24:38 治療関係なのぜ？それとも分子生物関係なのぜ？
身体がプラチナになっちゃう…メタルスライムになっちゃう…！
288 2018-04-05 23:24:20 I just find my spreader when I change the rate from say 2T to 6T/ha my spinner speed slows by 200rpm. Think it’s because the floor belt is robbing oil from spinners. 
289 2018-04-05 23:24:05 end complicity you served 6 presidents crimes? serve interests of "we the people", tell americans the truth on who did & benefited off 9/11? Reveal the war on an error cia-bush crimes, zionazicon banker big oil gang criminals & netanyahu lobby in u.s. gov who's buddies with trump
290 2018-04-05 23:23:56 Indeed. One only need look ar the success of land reclamation in the Alberta Oil Sands.
291 2018-04-05 23:23:54  la oil can’t hurt that thing huh Lo

296 2018-04-05 23:23:14 So bought some #rosehip #oil because it's meant to be good for #antiaging but boy does it stink!!! I usually enjoy all my #skincare but getting use to the smell will take some serious time!!!

297 2018-04-05 23:23:13 Hold on, you’re not being fair!  They have tax breaks to dole out to the oil companies.

302 2018-04-05 23:22:39 @EPAScottPruitt - When will you stop being in Big Oil's back pocket? Do what's right for the environment, consumers and American farmers. #RFSWorks
303 2018-04-05 23:22:38 Wind turbines are safer, cleaner, less disruptive to the environment (for people and animals), cheaper over the long term, lower input cost, unlimited energy potential, lower risk, less of an eyesore, and demand a premium internationally. Not really sure why one would choose oil.
304 2018-04-05 23:22:11 Oil painters really are a very different breed from acrylic painters. It's not like any other shift in medium, as the working properties are SOOOO different.

306 2018-04-05 23:21:58 Please @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic.  Ditch the krill oil!  It's needed by animals for their survival.  Be responsible!
307 2018-04-05 23:21:55 not sure why the oil tap to BC hasn't been shut off yet
308 2018-04-05 23:21:55 They talk about people who reuse their cooking oil. Talk about me then. I get at least 3 good uses out of my oil before I toss it!

310 2018-04-05 23:21:54 Even if all the pipelines Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the American corporations that control their oil and gas assets were built, Canada would still import its oil and gasoline. None of the pipelines will increase the amount of Canadian fossils fuels available in Canada.
311 2018-04-05 23:21:48 Guess this week's check from Big Oil bounced?

320 2018-04-05 23:20:57 The Senate Finance working budget has $184 million for oil and gas tax credits, a much higher amount than the House. #akleg
321 2018-04-05 23:20:20 Can't believe that all Pruitt's major attrocities against ppls water and lands, and illegal speed passes w/oil, fracking, etc. is not enough to get him Charged w/crimes or even out....but this other story is what gets him. Whatever it takes.
322 2018-04-05 23:20:07 I HATE when my mom cooks with coconut oil. Ugh
323 2018-04-05 23:20:03 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
324 2018-04-05 23:19:57 so the keystone pipeline was shut down after the oil started to seep into the land...

325 2018-04-05 23:19:56 When you’re in a bar and a dude screams and runs across the bar shouting “YOU’RE IN MY LIVING ROOM!”

And I kid you not guys, there is a life size oil painting that looks just like me in this dude’s living room. I don’t remember posing for this.
326 2018-04-05 23:19:52 How about you don't tell us what to do with our oil, gas and coal and we won't tell you what to do with your wind turbines?

337 2018-04-05 23:17:15 And you can keep your coal & oil. In the ground. Where it belongs. 

We can produce more than enough turbines to go around

Pruitt is the Poster boy for 
the Caldron of Corruption that is all things Trump-
Midterms can’t come soon enough! Can’t wait to VOTE BLUE
345 2018-04-05 23:15:54 We might be fine, but considering we need to borrow $1 trillion and China has been a huge buyer, interest rates might soon rival the late ‘70s. Oil might get prices in euro. And a retail bankruptcy that looks like a tsunami compared to what we have seen. Yep. Alls Good.
346 2018-04-05 23:15:37 I've been around both plenty. I'll take an oil well over a wind turbine any day. But I'm glad they're working out for you guys.
347 2018-04-05 23:15:26 just stopped by to say that these fresh carrots with olive oil and vinegar just made my day. carry on.

351 2018-04-05 23:15:07 Pruitt IS the swamp man. He received major donations from oil and gas companies......now he's charged with regulating them. You're worried about commerce? We have more money than we know what to do with, we just have it concentrated in the hands of the few.
352 2018-04-05 23:14:29 The feds throwing more money in useless directions to appear being worth their seats in cabinet... Drop the Carbon pricing, Quit importing Saudi oil and Build pipelines... there I saved 280K
353 2018-04-05 23:14:25 WE LOVE YOU "OIL TOT"!!!! Your such an inspiration that depending on weather conditions I think I will go on my 7,000 step requirement #DepressionWalk tomorrow. But this is weather dependent of course since it's been snowing here lately!
354 2018-04-05 23:14:21 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

356 2018-04-05 23:14:08 What’s wrong with oil? It’s suddenly dropped ?! 
357 2018-04-05 23:14:07 I wish in addition to anti-glare anti-scratch coatings, glasses came with oil repellent films. So that every time my cheek smooshes my lens I don't just schmeer it all over the whole surface when I try and wipe it away.

365 2018-04-05 23:13:29 No. This is a clear stereotype of the 'developed' world as civilized, and we in the Thirld world as 'savages'. Costa Rica has invested in clean, green energy for decades, even better than Germany. On the other hand, 'developed' United States has the oil lobby running politics.

368 2018-04-05 23:13:12 I only checked regular and double stuffed cause I don’t eat the others, but it said it “contains 1 or more of the following” and then lists a whole bunch including palm oil

373 2018-04-05 23:12:39 Not even close to correct.Every other oil producing region in the worldis busy..except Alberta. In the past we built projects in low commodity cycles to "cash in" on the high cycles except...Post Turdeau 1.0 and now. No company wants the risk with the NDP and Turdeau 2.0.
374 2018-04-05 23:12:35 A lot of his corruption as OK AG came to light when he was first being vetted for his cabinet position.  Emails, text messages with oil industry lobbyists, execs, etc.  The Rethuglicans gave him a pass.

384 2018-04-05 23:11:20 Now, if you want to make rice with beans inside. That's a whole other shit. Heat up the pot. Add a little bit of oil. Chop up onions, peppers, recao, cilantro, smashed garlic. Add it all in there once oil is hot. Add about 3 or 4 cubitos.

400 2018-04-05 23:09:16 If you can’t see the money oil has brought to Alberta everywhere you aren’t looking very hard. I grew up in Manitoba and it’s pretty easy to tell the difference.
401 2018-04-05 23:09:01 Okay I keep hearing that Oreos are vegan but I literally read the ingredients list the other day when I was grocery shopping and they have palm oil in them ??? So why do vegans still claim they’re vegan 
402 2018-04-05 23:09:00 Thank u all for helping them. It's terrible the attack on Christians now! I believe a lot of it stems from so many rich Muslims that have invaded us & their rich oil money has bought up a lot of USA companies. Also the 'New Age' groups are attacking us.
403 2018-04-05 23:08:55 I got them just in time for my birthday a few years back. Coconut oil and a mixture of peppermint and geranium essential oils. It helped a lot!

406 2018-04-05 23:08:51 Lmao I'm not a guru. It was always kind of struggle for me too back home, but for here I spritz with water, follow it up with liquid base moisturizer like hair milk or something, then follow up with a sealant like oil or shea butter based product
407 2018-04-05 23:08:45 I don’t have olive oil or vinegar
408 2018-04-05 23:08:41 The diesel oil may well improve the taste. Maybe the truck was travelling too fast for this fast food?
409 2018-04-05 23:08:39 Если правда, то это очень хорошо для них, когда мы там были, все запасы истощались и они не знали, как и во что ввязываться, чтобы жить дальше. У них везде были надписи keep calm we still have oil 
410 2018-04-05 23:08:32 Did you watch Martha tonight boy @Mexico are sneaky bastards! Their cooperation is false & temporary! Snake OIL salesman!
411 2018-04-05 23:08:28 Oil & coal are neither disruptive nor eyesores? Oil spills & coal smog make for a better place to live and have no effect on wildlife? You know Iowa exports windmills. Companies are making millions and energy costs are down. Your oil & coal don’t hold a candle to our turbines
412 2018-04-05 23:08:23 When you go get an oil change and they tell you it will be 30min but it’s been 3 hours...
413 2018-04-05 23:08:19 Look, I get why yer whining, yer mad Israel has been reborn, but you just need to accept THAT WILL NEVER BE REVERSED.  The last straw was the development of the Bakken formation--w/out Arab oil dominance, they wd have made peace with Israel by the 1920s. 
Just accept: It's. OVER!

420 2018-04-05 23:07:39 Está en su derecho, díganle a Oil que pague a sus empleados, cara de piedra
421 2018-04-05 23:07:37 Hell yes!  And actually we should treat oil as our most important resource. And make companies pay a fair price for it. So we can use it for the things that really are more important. We shouldn’t devalue it simply so we can have more empty campuses on western avenue.

428 2018-04-05 23:07:02 Yes you do!! I was in there today for an oil change and they told me the story! I told them I’d pass along the message!
429 2018-04-05 23:07:02 The liberal government under Trudeau has decimated the oil industry. Our only market is to the US who does not need our oil. We need pipelines to get our resource to tidewater and onto foreign markets.
430 2018-04-05 23:06:59 so i got an oil change for $19.95 and in the state of NJ with tax it ended costing $25.54 just tell me fucking why?do they need that much to build another toll booth..
431 2018-04-05 23:06:47 Well, this tariff business is getting ugly fast... the ultimate is for China to stop buying US oil. That would shake things up (no, @LukeGromen... calm down) who knows where this is all going to lead but it’s not good for world growth and may well give China more power globally.
432 2018-04-05 23:06:46 Ask them how the per barrel price of oil is working for them these days?
433 2018-04-05 23:06:44 One of the professors at work has a liter of olive oil in his office. I’ve never felt more connected to anyone.
434 2018-04-05 23:06:43 You can try a few drops of olive oil or vinegar

436 2018-04-05 23:06:31 I'm sitting all by myself at my daughter's Spring Concert hundreds of open seats and the over dipped in body oil women have to sit directly behind me.   Smh
437 2018-04-05 23:06:24 Put the spotlight back where it belongs; on oil companies that are making massive profits from polluting the earth.

439 2018-04-05 23:06:04 She's literally blogging about violife which is coconut oil based. I don't eat dairy, but I hope I'd never be such a dick about it.
440 2018-04-05 23:05:43 God I miss Oil Can
441 2018-04-05 23:05:41 But it's easy for me now. If you're cooking for yourself. The way I do it, I had 4 cups of water & 3 cups of rice. Let the water boil. Add a little bit of oil and salt. When it starts boiling, wash the rice and pour it in.
442 2018-04-05 23:05:31 He's a snake oil salesman. All he cares about are the adoring fans that stroke his ego.

Coz i cant buy soap 10k n it doesn't have protein,fat n oil n Carbohydrate  
449 2018-04-05 23:04:56 That doesn’t even make sense - Oil is needed to produce solar panels and wind turbines, along with cars, building materials, and to transport food. Build the pipeline!
450 2018-04-05 23:04:46 Good.  Let's make sure that Sarawakian will have full control of its oil and gas next.

453 2018-04-05 23:04:25 Some people still don’t get it. It’s not about big oil, it’s about lost wages, which result in less taxes being paid, its about lost revenue on royalties, its about loss of the trickle down from the higher wages paid to resource extraction workers,
454 2018-04-05 23:04:13 yeah i already got lavender oil but i don't have a diffuser or inhaler so rip..

465 2018-04-05 23:03:16 It does as much as the #Iraqi government. Like many Arab states #Iraq is no exclusion of acting as anti - #Israel while in fact it does oil and arms business with the Jewish state. But #KRG does not deny its ties as its not honorable to do so. #Iraq is corrupt & fake.

Why did they start by pushing man-made climate change junk science and an imagined gender pay gap at trade deal negotiations with Donald Trump instead actual trade issues like lumber, oil, tech, and minerals. Are the liberals ignorant or just stupid?

573 2018-04-05 22:47:56 Btw i hate palm oil. Fuck that palm oil!! Dont buy
574 2018-04-05 22:47:53 bio oil is great for scars!

580 2018-04-05 22:47:31 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

582 2018-04-05 22:47:23 One would hope there aren’t so many gullible American voters who would fall for Trump’s “snake oil” peddling.  One might ponder, then, that the only way Trump could win the election was if his supporters—in the U.S. and Russia—voted more than once!
583 2018-04-05 22:47:13 And Jesus must OK the burning of Oil and discredit Solar Energy . And issuing licenses in order to Fart, too.
584 2018-04-05 22:47:04 @Windows Defender is just fine for me thanks,  plus it's hard coded into the OS so very small footprint on the system, haven't had a problem since Windows 10 release when I stopped using all these snake oil antivirus softwares
585 2018-04-05 22:46:50 @matthewstoller I’m reasearching the deal Kissinger struck in the 70s to secure the pricing of oil in dollars - any resources you’d recommend?
586 2018-04-05 22:46:40 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
587 2018-04-05 22:46:25 how does the hit list go: 

Mexicans rapist- Hillary-rigged-Obama-China-Nato-Iraq oil

He usually gives each diversion a few weeks, but this week he's used them all
588 2018-04-05 22:46:18 Except they do impact the Canadian oil it’s production, transport and export all which effects why it’s falling behind. With government making it difficult and near impossible to get pipelines built to transport the oil to where it needs to go
589 2018-04-05 22:46:12 Yep, I can't disagree with you. Like an oil slick in places.
590 2018-04-05 22:46:12 Tell me how the bombings, deportations, wall street deregulations, fracking, and oil drilling that we would've been subject to under @HillaryClinton would work for women and the environment!! And keep attacking me with the identity politics!
591 2018-04-05 22:46:05 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?

593 2018-04-05 22:45:45 Baking is easy Niki. Here's what I do, buy a box of cake, add eggs, water and oil. Bake for the allotted time. Frost it with canned frosting and then I tell everyone I made it from scratch! lol
594 2018-04-05 22:45:41 Flank’s a good lean cut. Mine have been even leaner, eye of round, sometimes top/sirloin. Also supplement a high quality fish oil. Have to agree, higher fat does “feel” better, but higher protein satiates better, in my experiences. May explain Moore’s post on his small 3:1 test.
595 2018-04-05 22:45:38 I burned myself with cooking oil but it’s all good since errrbody gonna eat good once they get home from school/work
596 2018-04-05 22:45:34 @ColoColo Please win this! ffs
597 2018-04-05 22:45:30 Norway's Big oil is state owned, smaller production than Alberta, and saved over a trillion in their 'Heritage Fund' . Greed never got in their way.
598 2018-04-05 22:45:28 You said “those jobs are all low wage jobs” and I proved that wrong because under Obama we had one of the largest oil booms in US history.  And, the oil patch pays about 10k per month.  Sorry but, it’s looking like you have little idea what ur talking about
599 2018-04-05 22:45:26 either I buy unnecessary shit when I’m getting my oil changed at Walmart or i look like I’m up to no good, walking around lost.

603 2018-04-05 22:45:03 That's exciting. The oil interest led to some good micropaleo work, but how these basins are initiated, and how they relate to the basins in CA with "monterey" rocks is fascinating.
604 2018-04-05 22:44:55 Which is more evil though? The coal industry or the oil industry? The coal industry is MUCH smaller so that could be good for us! #TYTLive
605 2018-04-05 22:44:49 also if you ever need an oil cleanser i fell in love with theirs... so perfect and glides across your skin so easily

608 2018-04-05 22:44:36 Son: what oil did you use to cook this?
M: canola oil
S: oh that’s why it tastes like barf
M: I’ve used the same type of oil for 8 yrs
S: oh... well it still tastes like barf

612 2018-04-05 22:43:56 300 schools or more schools to go to where he go and start immediately, why come to Duke to be buried in the bench?

618 2018-04-05 22:43:39 The north is hugely investing in agriculture. Sad as it is, this diversity is not centralized. The northern oligarchy is quietly waiting for the oil to finish and then they pull out the failed state. They're only biding time.

625 2018-04-05 22:42:46 YES he did. And got away with it bc our state is so red. And he's mean: he sued Colorado when they passed marijuana bc he thought it would hurt his precious oil industry, not to mention the cash cow private prisons.

627 2018-04-05 22:42:39 Feeling amazed, starting a project with local company to heat my house with warmth of the earth. Another thousands litres of oil less burned by me per year! Fuck dat oil!
628 2018-04-05 22:42:38 That’s the dead one, it was run out of oil and seized.  Got a low mile replacement going in.  All in should have $1400 into it and going to ask 7500ish.
629 2018-04-05 22:42:37 Of course, as a Canadian, you're more than willing to claim your share of the benefits oil and gas have contributed to our standard of living aren't you? A tad hypocritical don't you think?
630 2018-04-05 22:42:29 @JamesGRickards I’m researching the deal Kissinger struck in the 70’s to get oil priced in dollars... any resources you’d recommend?
631 2018-04-05 22:42:18 Watch out now! #oklaedwalkout has a lot of supporters who work hard at oil related jobs!!! They are parents to these students you’re fighting for & are fighting with you!!!
632 2018-04-05 22:42:04 I’d slap my brother for frying sweet plantains in the same oil these fried snappers were fried in 
633 2018-04-05 22:41:56 Yes, he's dismantle everything you and the oil folks wanted.
634 2018-04-05 22:41:38 No president controls gas prices. It is totally oil & the gas companies. They also base their base price on what they have to pay for their lease. But, ur totally correct about what Obama accomplished. Amazing that he did. GOP was hell bent on blocking everything.
635 2018-04-05 22:41:33 Mkaaaaayyy I saw another YTer's review of the BB foundations and she has super dry skin as well. She used it with the Wake and Bake Oil, a product that I already own that works wonders. So I guess they'll be getting my coins. Again. Not a bad thing since I love the company lol
636 2018-04-05 22:41:32 Lady parked beside me at the store, I told her that her new Q50 is nice! She said I walked in for oil change and tire rotation, walked out with a new car.  I’ll stick to my G37 til I give out on me. They won’t get me like that.
637 2018-04-05 22:41:05 No blame games here, all our past governments knew these things..... I remember seeing the oil spill at   okrika in PH during my NYSC in 2009, I practically wept that day.

649 2018-04-05 22:39:42 The fact is that, having studied the Nigerian process from inception through to now, any clear headed fellow would be able to deduce that even the mantra for the civil war was false. It's about getting oil.
650 2018-04-05 22:39:39 Lol right? I’d never think to go to Walmart to buy my oil stuff. I think the air filters are cheaper too, not 100% sure tho. I have the reusable k&n’s in my car

Will he announce the that carbon tax is off the table? Is he firing Gerald Butts and #ClimateBarbie? No? Then fugetaboutit!

676 2018-04-05 22:36:38 I did know that Breton Woods was not just about oil. Although oil is the Worlds new gold & the US does fight wars for oil & against dropping the US dollar for the oil trade.

A slur about my "mind not being disciplined", just because I do not say exactly what you do is total BS.

680 2018-04-05 22:35:57 Oil industry is going to continue threatening like badly behaved children raising the bar in a power struggle. BigOil does business in Norway where taxes and royalties are high.
681 2018-04-05 22:35:46 If Trudeau wants to be cheered in Alberta he'd better champion the pipeline that has been approved and put an end to the debate. We will continue to use oil for decades to come and lack of capacity does harm to our economy. Investor confidence has evaporated.

706 2018-04-05 22:32:52 In India, the inverse relationship of small caps to the dollar could just be a function of the cost of oil for companies in India. Big name Financials tend to be less impacted by the cost of oil in INR terms.

710 2018-04-05 22:32:24 You mean helping oil barons create and fund more excuses to plunder, right?

713 2018-04-05 22:32:06 SA hs gautrain. Why cant we aspire to hv high speed trains. We hv th 2nd largest diamond reserves in the world. That is good enuf reason to dream abt high tech infrastructure. Dubai, a few years ago was barren but it took visionaries and oil money to  change their fortunes.

722 2018-04-05 22:30:25 These haters, like pruit and the new head of usfws, who wants to delist endangered species, are backed by the money and idealism I’d the Kochs and Mercers.

726 2018-04-05 22:29:39 yes! it has argan oil in it which is super hydrating, & it has more of a natural satin finish rather than matte so it isn’t drying!

733 2018-04-05 22:29:04 Picture the scene. Rump steak. Oil, salt, pepper, hot pan, bit of garlic. 4 mins either side. Straight out, sliced and onto a baguette. Just. Happened. Omg

735 2018-04-05 22:28:49 Thank you! Although, surprisingly enough, we won’t be focusing on the oil. Rather, studying the basal Monterey and its underlying sedimentary unit.
736 2018-04-05 22:28:48 We won't have salmon runs anymore when we have polluted streams (thanks EPA) and off shore drilling (thanks Interior) and Columbia oil tanker spill (thanks Energy Dept). Your little sea lion problem may be all you can comprehend but there are far bigger problems for SW WA.
737 2018-04-05 22:28:25 Would have thought that for any major marine oil spill prevention and response announcement related to #TransMountain tankers, @cathmckenna and @MarcGarneau would be there.
738 2018-04-05 22:28:25 Great day to be a Mountaineer. Feels good to have somebody acknowledged us as a state. As a Oil and Gas man, my family and I sure do appreciate the income. We took our first family vacation just last week. Est. 2013. Thank you President Trump and Governor Justice

740 2018-04-05 22:28:09 I was a young teen but i lived,ate,dreamed,sh1t Cowboys football. I would ride my bike and buy anything on the newsstands related to football and especially Cowboys football. I knew many fans too. We all believed Troy was a bust and the dumb oil guy n college coach ruining boys
741 2018-04-05 22:27:51 I’m at @Walmart getting an oil change and I’ve been here for TWO HOURS and they still haven’t even touched my car. And then they didn’t have the right filter and made me go to Autozone to get it. And my phone keeps dying so I have to keep going to the iPhones to charge it :(
742 2018-04-05 22:27:49 Just drink it not a nice taste i agree but it helps.. See your ears get olive oil drops in chemist helps well good my mums ears were blocked etc got olive oil drops her ears are perfect now

745 2018-04-05 22:27:25 Did you ever do the natural thread? I only use water, black soap, and organic coconut oil. Sometimes just water.
746 2018-04-05 22:27:17 Sent Gackt off. It's good. At the post office I was asked how I got my hair so long and more. Camellia oil and conditioner. Nice to be complimented.
747 2018-04-05 22:27:14 He initiated roll back of water & air quality standards; he initiated efforts to drill for oil in wildlife refuges and other coastal gems; he helped Zinke decrease the size of national monment areas to promote oil drilling; he took a very long nap that resulted in a broken door.
748 2018-04-05 22:27:04 Patent RUBBISH!!! SENility has clearly set in and an oil leak has sprung in your head. Any consideration that you are almost 70 and not at peak physical fitness as opposed to the condition of AFL players who are conditioned to adapt to travel?

750 2018-04-05 22:26:49 My version of "turning up" now is taking fish oil with a chaser because I need my omega-3's.
751 2018-04-05 22:26:47 Weird, last time I checked the liberals and the NDP didn’t control global oil prices when they took over, aaaaand they still don’t.
752 2018-04-05 22:26:38 Trudeau’s campaign was rife with oil lobbyists
753 2018-04-05 22:26:35 literally just coconut oil, baking soda, thieves essential oil & a lil bit of sea salt 

there is a fancy sugar called xilotol you can add for better enamal protection or something but 0 flouride & this shit keeps ya teeth healthy. ive only used it for about a year now  helps
754 2018-04-05 22:26:20 It is imperative that we get off oil now more than ever.
755 2018-04-05 22:26:18 Something I appreciate about Sonic Mania is that they didn't add loops to Oil Ocean. They put in more oil slides and fire to make it exciting, but no loops. Then they had the gall to make the second act into Sandopolis and buff up the submarine boss. Its one of my favorite levels
756 2018-04-05 22:26:06 Coconut oil and nourished skin all 2018
757 2018-04-05 22:26:03 oh dio mio, where’s the olive oil
758 2018-04-05 22:25:51 isn't there an arbitrage in the oil market forces oil to move to the same global price more or less (or the same grade of crude, net of transportation cost)?
759 2018-04-05 22:25:46 Obama, like Trudeau was totally in the #oil camp when he became president (until the Gulf atrocity). This highlights we need to get these greedy oil Barons out of political campaigns / period
760 2018-04-05 22:25:32 Just what you want in a kid's book later on, Pres. tRump  was responsible for the extinction of many plants and animals in the name of Oil & Gas  & Big Pharma, & Big Insurance, & Mineral rights, & Money..$

769 2018-04-05 22:24:32 A CNY oil contract where China wants cheaper oil in CNY and US wants more expensive oil in USD should, over time, drive a higher CNY/USD thru the oil link, no?
770 2018-04-05 22:24:24 Ther is a reason why the corrupt  US and UK bomb Afghanistan and invade these Muslim lands, and it isnt oil.
771 2018-04-05 22:24:15 Breton Woods it is not simply about oil. No country would willingly give up their currency being the worlds reserve. You may have read here and there but your mind lacks discipline.

774 2018-04-05 22:24:00 Haven't read the article, but SA is changing quite a bit lately and trying to show a (genuine?) more modern side, I suppose to attract foreign investors (oil isn't gonna last forever), but also maybe for less cynical reasons. I'm not close enough to know
775 2018-04-05 22:23:56 @GirlTalkZA ladies spirit,olive oil and magnolia oil does wonders for stretch marks.
776 2018-04-05 22:23:40 I'm sure no oil was used to make that sign either.
777 2018-04-05 22:23:40 Shame fans are still hung up on coconut oil. Plate approach, Pivetta’s improved breaking stuff, usage of Morgan late are all product of fine coaching detail

850 2018-04-05 22:15:54 He should've been thrown out of gov't when he was nailed for cutting n pasting oil co's talking points on his official corres. What about Oklahoma's earthquakes due to fracking thanks to Pruitt. He's a corrupt menace to our environment. Of course corrupt nitwit Prez loves him.
851 2018-04-05 22:15:53 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
852 2018-04-05 22:15:41 Then they get made when we say GFY.
853 2018-04-05 22:15:38 Ditch krill oil products and protect wildlife in the Antarctic

854 2018-04-05 22:15:36 Separation & segregation of PvP'ers & PvE'ers is a must for any game to survive past launch. Developers have to choose, eather a pure PvP game, or Pure PVE, you absolutely cannot mix the 2 together as it's like mixing oil & water, then lighting the oil on fire & evaporating water
855 2018-04-05 22:15:31 Spermwhale oil? Used for lighting and suchlike.
856 2018-04-05 22:15:27 I don't really like eastern cuisine, but serve it with a kebab and slather it in old fryer oil? .. So inspired!
857 2018-04-05 22:15:23 I love me some coconut oil. It’s really good for the skin
858 2018-04-05 22:15:22 I would recommend using a lot of coconut oil on top before your dye and don’t color it too light or leave it on too long
859 2018-04-05 22:15:19 A common struggle of mine is wanting to condition my hair but adding too much hair oil, making it too greasy, needing to wash it again, needing to re condition so it's an ongoing circle
860 2018-04-05 22:15:13 Stop showing your ignorance of GP's policies.

They campaign to close oil companies, close oil pipelines, keep fossil fuels in the ground, and urge others to go plastic-free.

Who suggested GP denied using petroleum? You're fabricating claims.

862 2018-04-05 22:14:56 Ayo yes! I be getting my oil changed really thinking I did something
863 2018-04-05 22:14:31 I've got hold of one of the Normag valves and it's sitting on my Schlenk line. Need to fill it with oil but I like it and gives me better pressure than I had before. Impressive. Thank you.
864 2018-04-05 22:14:26 Oil companies wouldn't have someone killed. They'd buy that most likely. Especially in recent times. Maybe they'd kill ya in the 60s or something but these days they'd be likely to hire you and shower you with gifts.
865 2018-04-05 22:14:21  donating just because
866 2018-04-05 22:14:09 Hope your right but you know the big old oil money will fight and fight dirty until the end, like they have been
867 2018-04-05 22:14:01 Waited fivever to get an oil change and now sitting here feeling Uncomfortably Embarrassed in the waiting area, bc the Jiffy Lube dudes know I'm a Trash Person.
868 2018-04-05 22:13:59 They told me to take magnesium, cod liver oil and b12 complex supplements,  thank God it hasn't ever come back.
869 2018-04-05 22:13:55 Also oil and water

874 2018-04-05 22:13:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective

878 2018-04-05 22:12:46 Paid an extra shipping fee to get a book delivered tomorrow.  Oil beef hooked if it doesn’t arrive on schedule.
879 2018-04-05 22:12:45 "Ah, but that is where you are wrong, my dear."

With a look, a bottle is warming body oil would appear right next to Soranik. This was a very special oil. Warming to the touch, soothing for the body, incredibly scented. Like the black roses of Hell.

"Feel free to undo my top."
880 2018-04-05 22:12:42 I came for an oil change and ended up having to fix other stuff... joy
881 2018-04-05 22:12:21 Will, please, I enjoy your tweets but I do not want to know your measurements. Although some of your followers will probably swoon.

886 2018-04-05 22:11:49 You are right, they met very low oil prices, ordinarily, that should be a good argument except, and here comes the clincher, they went to town and borrowed trillions literally, to develop infrastructure, so the issue of limited resources on account of low oil prices is negated
887 2018-04-05 22:11:48 Wait a minute, didn’t they just discover a shit tonne of oil? 
888 2018-04-05 22:11:36 i wanna design bag and keychains this wken  but will i have time :'''''''') i have gouache painting to finish and an oil painting to make progress on
889 2018-04-05 22:11:17 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
890 2018-04-05 22:11:06 I love a spoon of natural peanut butter or almond butter in my oatmeal mixed with whey.

Tastes like heaven.

Personally I wouldn’t mix in MCT oil with oatmeal, I’d prefer actual coconut oil for taste.

MCT great with a post-workout shake though.
891 2018-04-05 22:11:02 My life revolves around coconut oil & cocoa butter
892 2018-04-05 22:11:00 honestly? probably Sharpie permanent markers are the best  you will find including their metallic selections. If you want some premium supplies without going to an art store - try a Barnes & Noble - near me they have pigment and india ink markers + oil pencils & charcoal
893 2018-04-05 22:10:44 Yawn - does that mean anything to anyone who works in oil/gas in Alberta? Another opportunity to wear a hard hat and safety vest with yellow stripes. Will Trudeau deliver more than feel good pap - I think not.
894 2018-04-05 22:10:44 Trump - the #Oil Oligarch’s wet dream, also backed by Koch, Exxon et al) are delighted with the 4 year delay (regression) since lack of progress in the critical transition to 100% renewable in all sectors - means more profit at our expense : peril.

906 2018-04-05 22:09:45 @sarkodie why do you most of the times make reference to baby Oil like that.

907 2018-04-05 22:09:42 One of my daily rituals as well is coffee with butter and coconut oil. Perfect keto beverage and its bomb as fuck my dude.
908 2018-04-05 22:09:39 I think the highlight of my day was when this lady told me she uses cannabis oil to treat her dogs seizures.... (it didn’t work)
909 2018-04-05 22:09:30 So I’m (mostly) not going crazy. Live in HB and was going to check out. Funny thing is I HAVE eaten there as I used to have an office in Vernon. Used to fill up on their bread and olive oil. If you are in the area check out Guadalajara Inn in Bell. GREAT Mexican food.
910 2018-04-05 22:09:09 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
911 2018-04-05 22:09:04 Exactly. Seems incredibly short sighted, rather like biofuels to replace oil, not thought through.

914 2018-04-05 22:08:42 My only argument here is that most loot box systems are for aesthetic items, not a 1:1 service. You’ve already received the service, sometimes even for free, and they’re giving you the chance to like. Have a martini while you get your oil changed.
915 2018-04-05 22:08:42 To the family who came to my store on 3April18: Your CBD Oil drops are here! Please call me 321-408-2211. You left NO phone # & I have emailed several times with NO response. Kind regards, Ali
916 2018-04-05 22:08:33 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
917 2018-04-05 22:08:32 Check @RomanShaving start with a hot towel, then a little pre-shave oil. Lather up with a good soap, a sharp blade, then a nice after-shave lotion.

922 2018-04-05 22:07:53 Elon, First day Model 3 reservation. My A4 has 216800 miles, burning a quart of oil a week! Help, I need my M3 ASAP!
923 2018-04-05 22:07:50 good condition, good miles to the gallon, tires fine, oil fine, dm if interested. serious inquiries only though
924 2018-04-05 22:07:39 That should help out oil prices

932 2018-04-05 22:07:01 reading for a bit, looks like +plus CBD is a good product, 
If you can find somewhere that sells Green Roads or Real Scientific Hemp Oil I would go for one of those as I know first hand works. 
Imp thing is that you should treat CBD as a supplement the more you take it the better
933 2018-04-05 22:06:33 motor oil isnt for drinking

935 2018-04-05 22:06:24 You honestly think oil field jobs is what this country needs? More pollution?
936 2018-04-05 22:06:18 I am doing all of the things to rid this fried oil smell from my home.
937 2018-04-05 22:06:12 If essential oils get into the eye, dilute the area immediately with vegetable (olive, coconut, etc.) or carrier oil. Do this by placing the vegetable oil on a tissue and gently wiping the eye area. Repeat as necessary.

940 2018-04-05 22:05:57 Of course I do, and of course they do.  China can put their people to work making it into all manner of fuel and plastic, unencumbered by emmissions laws, labor standards, etc., and pass the savings on to the oil companies who export it by paying more than TX does.
941 2018-04-05 22:05:57 That's why wages today are equal to wages in the 70s. Most people don't work in oil fields bud. They work at this nations largest employer... Walmart

945 2018-04-05 22:05:35 Yes! Coconut oil can solve a lot of things for the skin and hair, even lashes and brows! I googled it just to make sure, but I knew it would work! I would put it on your skin before tanning, I believe it can help you tan better and the stretch marks as well!

957 2018-04-05 22:03:47 Using that beard oil?
958 2018-04-05 22:03:39 Like what.  Oil isn’t an asset.  Renewables aren’t assets.  The potential tax revenues may be but those would be swallowed up by reduction in Barnett.  This is basic stuff

993 2018-04-05 21:59:39 What I find strange is that Fenway Park has Irving Oil Ltd. logos in it, Chris...because I was born in, and lived in for my entire school life plus a few years extra, the city where it's refinery is...Saint John, N.B., Canada(primary news channel there is @CTVAtlantic) =)

All major oil producers are rushing to produce more, because 
-they expect conditions placed on them later
-they think renewables will take over soon, so cash in as fast as you can

If not, @EPAScottPruitt doesn't care.

1009 2018-04-05 21:57:54 Yes definitely. I put it in the night before I’m planning to wash my hair to really let it sink in. Its not an oily oil if that makes sense, so it doesn’t get on your pillows etc. It’s made the world of difference to the condition 
1010 2018-04-05 21:57:54 Hahahaha that is awesome!!!!

1013 2018-04-05 21:57:29 Why is what $AMZN does really any different from what Standard Oil did? $AMZN says it’s entitled to cheaper shipping costs because it ships more, yet that was Rockefeller’s justification for preferential railroad rates. @timseymour @MelissaLeeCNBC @RiskReversal

The sauce is so similar- 50% ginger, 30% green onion, 20% cilantro. Chop everything, add oil and salt.  Mix with a dab of oyster sauce for extra codi-ness.

1052 2018-04-05 21:52:22 Na Vettes are significantly cheap for what they are to be honest... an oil change is like any other car 80 bucks. Only time it gets expensive is for tires and brake jobs
1053 2018-04-05 21:52:22 Lots of people who struggle with anxiety/panic disorder/depression have had fantastic results. There are many different products out there.

1056 2018-04-05 21:52:00 In 2017, Oil Ministry has over the past few months asked the company to provide several details of the deal of ONGC Ltd.'s $2.475 billion purchase of #Videocon including the basis of the valuation.

1067 2018-04-05 21:50:30 I'm gonna try it again tomorrow, but bring it with me since there's a sephora right where I work. The fenty worked for me for a while, I used to have more dry skin and slight oiliness on my nose, but lately my nose oil has been outta control so the fenty stopped working.

1071 2018-04-05 21:50:23 I am not surprised. They can only drive their little narrative, but it has a flat tire, low oil and is out of gas.

1075 2018-04-05 21:50:01 Can't argue with this. WM Gov has amassed nearly £2 Trillion debt and with the insanity of Brexit still to make its mark they can't afford to let Scotland go taking the oil & other resources with it. They will stop at nothing to prevent Indy. We are in for a helluva fight.

1083 2018-04-05 21:49:10 Frying absolutely requires oil. Everything else is a little more wishy washy. Just use whatever term makes the most sense to you. By everything falls into anneat category. Roasting typically involves hot air all around. I’d call this “charring” or maybe pan-toasting.

1087 2018-04-05 21:48:40 I'm not worried about Nigeria's present social and economic situation as much as I am worried that very idea of "Nigeria" is either dying or dead.

If we tell ourselves the truth, we're merely passing through the motions, with no plans, essentially waiting for oil to finish.

1090 2018-04-05 21:48:05 Getting an oil change is always so awkward. It's like:

"Look how dirty your air filter is"

Bro I know, don't rub it in

"Look your oil is full and clean now"



"Do you think my dad still loves me? :("

Uhhhhhh

Now I have a message alert that says "I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message"
1100 2018-04-05 21:46:44 It was a $1.3 million oil spill clean up and they only get fined $200 000.00 does not make sense.
1101 2018-04-05 21:46:32 A life tme 5 star government shill for the oil industry turns out not to be the best fit for the EPA. What are the odds.
1102 2018-04-05 21:46:31 A bought-and-sold oil man in charge of the EPA? Why would we be surprised? He is the epitome of the swamp.

1110 2018-04-05 21:45:44 To all my friends that enjoy working on their cars themselves, Walmart sells oil ALOT cheaper then auto zone, pep boys, and o’Reilly’s. I’m talking about good synthetic oils too not Walmart brand.
1111 2018-04-05 21:45:44 Now that I’m thinking about it, mincing some garlic, onion, and peppers and sautéing then in some olive oil to throw in the rice would be really good too.

1113 2018-04-05 21:45:30 Hap a  couple come into the shop today and say they didn't want cardboard inside their oil filter. IDIOTS. All oil filters have cardboard inside them to filter the oil. Figured I would have been written up if I put that they were IDIOTS on their ticket.

1116 2018-04-05 21:45:16 .@RothCornet just caught up on the Indian Joan bit. How about a lady who steals artifacts from museums and returns them to where they belong?

1117 2018-04-05 21:45:13 Drain off the water. Mash it till it looks like scrambled egg. Add garlic granules nutritional yeast salt pepper and herbs you like.

1130 2018-04-05 21:43:57 And yet we can't seem to diversify our economy from dependence on oil & gas. We need help!
1131 2018-04-05 21:43:55 I overcooked mine last time! how long on each side? And do you flour it( sauteed in olive oil?)
1132 2018-04-05 21:43:51 高畑監督...
1133 2018-04-05 21:43:47 Most challah is made w/oil. Butter isn't used because it's dairy. Using oil means that those who keep kosher can serve challah w/meat or dairy meals.And it is one of the easiest,least fussy breads that I bake!
1134 2018-04-05 21:43:42 In the mood to massage a phat ass with some oil
1135 2018-04-05 21:43:39 It's time to stop selling krill oil products! They hurt ocean life, especially vulnerable species.

1136 2018-04-05 21:43:35 + hand-woven rug from some exotic land. The oil paintings, are all original copies, the furniture is all imported. I think the violin... that is probably the only item that I have had for a very long time, and that has more sentimental value. but +
1137 2018-04-05 21:43:33 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1138 2018-04-05 21:43:32 Things I've learned today
- it takes a minimum of 4 gallons of oil in a baby pool for oil wrestling
- Panera delivers

1140 2018-04-05 21:43:26 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
1141 2018-04-05 21:43:13 Mic drop!
1142 2018-04-05 21:43:00 Jimmy I'm shocked! You've been advising for months to stay out of the oil patch. Millenials don't like fossil fuels. REMEMBER? Afraid the train is leaving the station? I'll bet you've been loading up on XOM hand over fist!  Hack
1143 2018-04-05 21:42:56 Indeed,  dat part of de the rule to be a leader
1144 2018-04-05 21:42:55 Not just LNG, there many large polluters in Gladstone region. Remember the "trial shale oil plant" on top of other industries operating with little or no environmental monitoring. Self-monitoring is a joke. Do you report yourself for speeding?
1145 2018-04-05 21:42:50 I eat a lot of high oil, high salt, fried foods and my body is seriously so exhausted from me treating it like dirt.
I haven't! That's a great idea, nat!
1146 2018-04-05 21:42:46 Here is the system in a nutshell. You have a few executives from the banks, oil companies and military contractors controlling the entire United States using the CIA as a secret police. There is no democracy in America. There seemed to be some freedom when I was a kid.
1147 2018-04-05 21:42:42 @TouchPH @PHtraffic @PhGardenCity . Please how do I get to bell oil and gas, transamadi from slaughter. Thanks for the prompt response
1148 2018-04-05 21:42:39 Marsha Blackburn works for wealthiest county in USA-Williamson. That’s her bubble. #tennessee is a poor state made poorer by Republican oil magnate governor. Wise up TN & stop GOP gerrymandering- it’s racist crap. we’ll need a dem attorney general& governor to turn things around
1149 2018-04-05 21:42:39 LMFAOO! u keep that baby oil and never forget it 
1150 2018-04-05 21:42:24 My car’s leaking oil. Ima slap this boy on and see if it works 
1151 2018-04-05 21:42:04 Liberal democracy is inherently undemocratic. It empowers snake oil salesmen to rise to the most influential positions in government, it divides the nation, and it forces the people to vote on matters which they are not qualified to decide.

The solution: the Corporate State.
1152 2018-04-05 21:42:03 Now that's besides getting to the power plays like hosting the Olympics, world cup, WYFS (World youth forum), influencing elections in France & the USA, collaborating with OPEC to raise Oil prices otherwise they were doomed, planning to send manned missions to Mars... Etc.
1153 2018-04-05 21:41:48 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1154 2018-04-05 21:41:48 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1155 2018-04-05 21:41:41 @Pottstato Ooh I asked people about CBD oil for anxiety/panic disorder can you fill me in? And not try to just sell me some like someone did before

1157 2018-04-05 21:41:27 The involvement of gulf states in supporting ISIS is interesting but I don’t really understand why it would have been decisive. They had lots of people coming to help, as individuals, and shitloads of money from oil sales.
1158 2018-04-05 21:41:24 I would love to see a forest of oil rigs off the coast. We need to be INDEPENDENT as our DECLARATION said.
1159 2018-04-05 21:41:22 Sure sure...oil field jobs are low paying now. Hmmm... interesting.  No, sorry, he created the longest job growth history in the entire history of this country and it bothers the hell out of you guys and we are McLovin’ it . Praise God Obama’s economy is still rolling now 
1160 2018-04-05 21:41:13 I can’t wait to finish work tomorrow just so I can spend the night researching CBD oil 
1161 2018-04-05 21:41:10 Now that I finally know the joys of essential oil diffusers, I want to take mine on the road with me to my hotel next week. Is that weird?
1162 2018-04-05 21:41:10 olive oil loml 
1163 2018-04-05 21:40:58 Because @ScottPruittOK is a corrupt oil industry shill?  It's supposed to be the Environmental PROTECTION Agency.
1164 2018-04-05 21:40:55 if you know an oily skinned lady, tell her to try it. my makeup lasts exponentially longer now that the oil is under control and looks way better throughout the day.
1165 2018-04-05 21:40:55 Farm belt voters work hard but obviously aren’t very informed. The snake oil wagon was highly successful when it rolled through town
1166 2018-04-05 21:40:55 Spilling eucalyptus oil all over my notes has everything I own smelling like vivaporu. Fix it Jesus.
1167 2018-04-05 21:40:54 Lol that African Black Soap, some shea butter and tea tree oil  & egg and lemon masks tbh lol
1168 2018-04-05 21:40:52 Also comparing Oklahoma's economy to the Texas economy on a scale of how much to tax the oil business will end bad for Oklahoma. There are some factors that keep Texas rolling even with a higher rate and OK doesn't have them all.
1169 2018-04-05 21:40:47 amazing.. oil &water dont mix water doesnt pollute its absolute we pollute water then purify it it was clean When God created it. Water is important to life it makes up to 90% body weight this is good for physical life. Spiritual life The Living Water cleanses = everlasting life
1170 2018-04-05 21:40:37 That's true, however I'm disabled and making my oil unfortunately won't work. We shouldn't even be put under this type of stress.
1171 2018-04-05 21:40:36 Jiffy lube once changed FocusedxMinds van's engine with antifreeze instead of motor oil, it's safe to say they are 1000% cluelesa
1172 2018-04-05 21:40:29 1:1 purchase systems have been the active product/service exchange for businesses. No one would go to an auto shop for a chance at getting their oil changed. They would want the service/product they came for.
1173 2018-04-05 21:40:24 I hate getting oil changes
1174 2018-04-05 21:40:15 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！

1183 2018-04-05 21:39:52 Presently OVL has 16 percent stake in Offshore Area 1, which holds as much as 75 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

OIL has 4 percent & a unit of BPCL another 10 percent stake. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 percent stake, ENH (15 percent)& PTTEP (8.5 percent)

1189 2018-04-05 21:39:29 Pruitt was, is and always will be owned by the robber barons especially oil and gas. The Koch brothers probably have him on speed dial.
1190 2018-04-05 21:39:25 It's the Cover FX Power Play foundation. I got it because my nose has been hella oily so the Fenty foundation I was using wasnt lasting. But this looks real cakey on my whole face, and oil is still coming thru on my nose, but my pores loook.....horrible.

1263 2018-04-05 21:31:33 Renewable energy of course includes carbon neutral energy sources ;-). 

We have sufficient alternative technologies that oil and gas can be nearly entirely replaced by renewables right now. 

Would you support an immediate halt of all new fossil fuel infrastructure.

1265 2018-04-05 21:31:18 And then, how is it possible that we believed in the 70s in the imminent end of oil and not now?

1268 2018-04-05 21:31:11 Forgot to bring moisturiser on holiday with me to Marbella but did bring Bio Oil which I’m using all over my face! I’m going to look 15 next week, aren’t I!

1270 2018-04-05 21:30:55 lol  Press?  Truth??

Oil and water.  Opportunists.  Traitors and despicable.  

Perish with the rest.
1271 2018-04-05 21:30:45 April 5=Proverbs 5

3For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.
4 But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.

For the immoral woman or the one who is quick to judge: Check John 8:1-11, its good
1272 2018-04-05 21:30:18 I think you struck oil.
1273 2018-04-05 21:30:17 Not forgetting the tax breaks @Shell & @BP_plc get that help our economy underperform, Norway  4.7% less output generated £15k million revenue whereas our oil fields function at a lose... Go figure #JokeMinster logic
1274 2018-04-05 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1275 2018-04-05 21:30:10 Not the point.
a) growth in per person debt isn't primarily about state profligacy. The 2008 global crisis hit ON far harder, for longer than other provs. Oil price bust hit AB, SK and NL harder than other provs.
b) AB has lowest level of per person debt. No affordability problem
1276 2018-04-05 21:30:09 Y’know you’re winning at life when you get in your car after work and the “Low Oil” alert pops up and then “Low Fuel” alert is right after it.

1284 2018-04-05 21:29:29 Jackie, in her honesty, sold the hell out of your foundation. Even to a dry skinned girl like me! I’m thinking the even numbers will be your dewy tones but I’m still buying 27 and adding extra baking oil on the 19th!
1285 2018-04-05 21:29:20 @OregonGovBrown But you willingly allow troops from your home state to fly thousands of miles overseas to fight for oil and to overthrow foreign governments? Sure hope Oregon votes you out as soon as possible -- obviously not the right person to lead a state.

1290 2018-04-05 21:28:33 Niger Deltans have accepted to be enslaved by Housa/Fulani, so I dont know what you are talking about. They had the opportunity to embrace their original Igbo brothers and sisters but they think that all it takes to develop and live in peace is Oil. Even when only North benefits.
1291 2018-04-05 21:28:32 Responsibly would be pipelines. Also maybe encourage Canadian refineries refining Canadian oil for Canadian markets.

1299 2018-04-05 21:27:31 I pulled up to get my oil changed and the guy literally asked me turn my music up. I’m glad everyone loves Michael Jackson. 
1300 2018-04-05 21:27:27 Nah, not really, I just can't get over the final hurdle, I can see it's clean under the oil but I just can't get the oil to disperse through the strands. Wondering if it may just look sleek ultimately.
1301 2018-04-05 21:27:19 *delete '2016-17 fiscal transfer' 

*insert'oil price $113 assumption'

That's word for word the pro-UK criticism of the 2014 white paper.
A doorstop of a propagandising masquerading as govinfo  that an entire government apparatus laboured to burp up 4 years ago

Well done
1302 2018-04-05 21:27:04 I don't buy snake oil!

1304 2018-04-05 21:26:56 Does it cater only experts who are already in SAP. what if a domain specific can be picked up to make much versatile solutions. like I am from oil and gas industry (subsea) and an end user in PLM for 10yrs. could add up 2 diversity. training on tool could be just a matter of time
1305 2018-04-05 21:26:54 Other parts of the world have been living that nightmare for long time, bombing countries because influence, oil and who knows what. Mind your own business, it's better for everyone, put that money in health care, education... leave rest of the world alone.

1330 2018-04-05 21:23:46 no oil and a really good pan

1343 2018-04-05 21:22:37 You said using oil was recycling.  It might be but it's a truly, monumentally ignorant statement given the state of carbon pollution we have.

If you were being smart, you'd say let's save the oil to make medical plastics.
1344 2018-04-05 21:22:33 When I was working on March for Science, I was really shocked at how many of our satellite volunteers suggested we partner with big oil companies, Monsanto, etc. We were like wtf?? We said no to that for the same reason we were nonpartisan.
1345 2018-04-05 21:22:26 @Holland&Barret, @Morrisons, @Natures_Best & @superdrug have ditched krill oil products. Why isn't @BootsUK doing what they can to #ProtectAntarctic?

1401 2018-04-05 21:16:19 Whatever the #OceansProtectionPlan is, it is not 'world leading, as you claim. 'World leading' would be the Alaskan standard for marine oil spill response in Prince William Sound, which is twice the BC standard for #TransMountain tankers. Sorry.
1402 2018-04-05 21:16:15 Y’all it’s mf hard working in the oil field and still having to go home to make dinner for me n kev .. I need a long shower and shleeep.  #HELP
1403 2018-04-05 21:16:12 So Bahrain announces it's discovered more oil than Russia has, & 2 days later a new UK naval base opens in Bahrain. Well played, someone. Well played.
1404 2018-04-05 21:16:11 @Aspiration do you have any plans to offer biz banking accounts? I heard about your new policy not to use your customer's money to fund oil pipelines and I'd love to bank with you.
1405 2018-04-05 21:16:11 While it is not part of OPEC, it has unofficially agreed to cut production to keep oil prices elevated. Also, they have said that it will take 5 years for production to start from new well.
1406 2018-04-05 21:16:01 Voters hit 50 percent on Monday, which puts him higher than that of gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs.

1411 2018-04-05 21:15:27 got rich thru hard work & not because he kept oil royalties low & cut private deals with OSSA companies. I appreciate ur perspective but they made (maybe still do) extensive use of TFWs which depressed wages in this aspect of oil patch work. They build cheap & operate cheap &

1414 2018-04-05 21:14:57 Doesn’t fit on my hard drive. Too many barrels of oil are filling it up.
1415 2018-04-05 21:14:49 That moment your so tired you take a nap waiting on your oil change 
1416 2018-04-05 21:14:48 Friendship and money. Oil and water.

1428 2018-04-05 21:13:07 Zimbabwe and Ghana had a split second of imaginery power. You can't say you have power when their economic sanctions can send you back 60 years in a couple of hours. Lybia was completely out of reach to the west for a very long time and because of oil, it could dictate terms...
1429 2018-04-05 21:12:53 If yall need a oil change hmu. Ill do it on the side for $40 but keep that lowkey.

1435 2018-04-05 21:12:21 Yep, stir a few torn leaves through pasta and olive oil. Or wild garlic pesto! Wild garlic, olive oil, Parmesan, pine nuts, blitz...
1436 2018-04-05 21:12:17 Oil, omg the oil. I have to fully blot at least 4 times a day at work and I take makeup off as soon as I get home because I’m so oily, ugh
1437 2018-04-05 21:12:11 They find oil and call in international oil companies the day after. Venezuela has oil elsewhere and it will remain untapped underground forever...
1438 2018-04-05 21:12:04 I also know the struggle of not being able to take certain medicines due to antidepressants. Here's what I do; rub some lavender oil on your wrists and under your nose, make some green tea with honey, and take a long hot bath! I hope you start to feel better, my dear! ♡
1439 2018-04-05 21:11:51 Yeah- coundn't have been the plummeting worldwide oil prices and economic breakdown. That was happening before they even took office.
1440 2018-04-05 21:11:41 Yea andy. I got my oil changed on my truck last month and the guy there gave me one.
1441 2018-04-05 21:11:28 Why isn't there a place where I can get my taxes done and an oil change at the same time? @jiffylube @HRBlock Get on this!
1442 2018-04-05 21:11:04 La bolsita me salió en 30 lo demás fue los utensilios y un oil para humectar antes del pre-make up

1448 2018-04-05 21:10:17 it is shale of a low grade. Conventional oil which is cheap to extract has already peaked.
1449 2018-04-05 21:10:11 Just remember Bahrain just locates 80 Billion Barrels, will have oil to market in 5 years. And Canada struggles to bring our commodity to market.we should send protesters to Bahrain

1452 2018-04-05 21:09:50 Unless of course we talk about building pipelines though your beloved Quebec, which you’ll never do. Let’s just keep buying billions of $s of oil from Saudi Arabia. Your attempt to be everything to everyone isn’t going very well. Have you seen your polling numbers lately?
1453 2018-04-05 21:09:48 I swear im bouta start throwing my wig back on fuck it. I be drowning my shit in castor oil now 
1454 2018-04-05 21:09:48 To me this is emblematic of exactly your point. Because one may want to genuinely help others, but can't much without getting paid for it, and generally won't step back to look at why people need help — or need paid. And then snake oil on top.

1458 2018-04-05 21:09:20 So basically, rather than being in with the oil oligarchs that were bleeding Russia dry, Putin rounded them up and kicked them out. #bbc4

1460 2018-04-05 21:09:08 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
1461 2018-04-05 21:09:05 Put on argan oil in the evening or a super hydrating night cream! Or go in Sephora and cry and get fancy samples
1462 2018-04-05 21:09:01 I decided recently to go back to olive oil soap as soon as all my shower gel / bubble bath stockpile is finished. Will take a while thanks to Christmas and the fact that I use it sparingly......
1463 2018-04-05 21:08:43 Furthermore, it's not actually end of life for a lot of these products. Oil, for example, can be rerefined and reused over and over.
1464 2018-04-05 21:08:43 Was doing all this since i was in 8 , Never missed any chance , was begging ,i cried in tahajud , i burnt my midnight oil  , i prayed alot , i did not know that my efforts will be fruit less tears at end , if i knew it it would be the best !

But the fucking me wasted everything.

1472 2018-04-05 21:06:57 Some say that his donated blood was used as oil for an F1 car.
1473 2018-04-05 21:06:49 Reason why i didn’t want to get a Chrysler damn oil change $100.
1474 2018-04-05 21:06:35 Well, they certainly cant manage the market with us and Brazil there to interrupt. We as a country shouldn't be dependent on oil though, its horrible. I bough a hybrid, but with rising gas prices it really makes no difference on my budget.
1475 2018-04-05 21:06:33 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.

1477 2018-04-05 21:06:25 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic Stop selling Krill oil that is fished in sensitive waters in the antarctic or any other sensitive area
1478 2018-04-05 21:06:23 Oil and Gas are the backbone of our economy.
1479 2018-04-05 21:06:18 Yes these canola oil stans are shaking , they be resorting to racism in arguments now on stan twitter looool  tragic
1480 2018-04-05 21:06:11 Let's be clear: Literally the only reason @EPAScottPruitt hasn't been sacked is because the oil industry owns the Trump administration. (well that and Trump's administration is a dysfunctional mess, but yeah)
1481 2018-04-05 21:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1482 2018-04-05 21:06:04 Rather disgusted to see that @BootsUK are still peddling the latest “health” fad, selling krill oil, stealing food from the most majestic creatures on Earth, the whales, and threatening the feeding ground of them, penguins and seals. Another reason to shop at @superdrug

1485 2018-04-05 21:05:33 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
1486 2018-04-05 21:05:33 Thanks for sharing

1494 2018-04-05 21:04:47 @NicolleDWallace FYI not everyone from OK & in the energy bz thinks Scott Pruitt is the bomb. He is crooked & evil & trying to destroy the planet. Oil & gas is a necessary natural resource. most people understand a full host of energy resources is needed to replace fossil fuels.
1495 2018-04-05 21:04:47 The U.S. EIA has forecasted that 2018 crude oil production will average 10.7 million barrels per day, the highest annual average since 1970...
1496 2018-04-05 21:04:32 Who the fuck does Pruitt think he is? Him having a 30 person detail is laughable. The fact that he's making deals for oil or fossil fuel companies while on tax payer money. Building a secret phone booth in his office,FOR WHAT? THIS IS ALL ILLEGAL 100% ILLEGAL! PUT HIM IN JAIL NOW
1497 2018-04-05 21:04:01 Interesting. The whole system Russia has going for oil seems tenuous at best.
1498 2018-04-05 21:04:01 Dangerous? Do you think the toddlers running the country will see this and try to put an oil pipeline up their asses?

1503 2018-04-05 21:03:34 bitumen has such a low energy returned on energy invested that without a light sweet crude energy subsidy it isn't viable. put another way 1 barrel of oil energy invested in bitumen yields 1.5 barrels of energy or a net of .5 vs 1 to get 10 or a net of 9 of Saudi oil
1504 2018-04-05 21:03:33 So is it lotion ? Is it like a oil ? What we doing here ?

1524 2018-04-05 21:01:16 @mlofgran Hi Matt
share price is sliding day by day while your pumping more oil any news on its way yet?
1525 2018-04-05 21:01:14 There’s quite a number of vessels in Europe that’s got nothing to do since the crash of the oil sector. Judging by the costs of energy, sizes and weight of WTGs, Monopiles and jackets. Would new vessels really make much difference if any?
1526 2018-04-05 21:01:07 Can’t find my coconut oil 
1527 2018-04-05 21:01:04 *walks into smoothie bar*

Me: what add-ins do you recommend for a sore throat?

Cashier: CBD oil helps everything

Me: ok I’ll have a... uhh... “Orange 
Kush” smoothie w/ cbd oil”

1531 2018-04-05 21:00:41 Strong soaps can strip essential oils from your skin, so gentle mild cleansers are better to use on a regular basis. Some oil that your skin produces is good for it and should be kept in the skin.

1537 2018-04-05 21:00:15 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1538 2018-04-05 21:00:12 #DeadlineWH ALMOST criminal? Scott Pruitt is literally in pockets of oil/gas industry, extracting wallets & accepting wads of cash. Dems need to start SCREAMING for an investigation...or better yet, a Special Counsel to investigate greed/grift/graft throughout Trump admin.

1540 2018-04-05 21:00:08 Because of lovely cheap random oil and huge buyers of weapons.
1541 2018-04-05 21:00:04 In today’s modern cars and with the modern oils you can go well beyond that. Don’t get caught in the scheme to buy oil and filters when you don’t have to.

1549 2018-04-05 20:59:04 Give him time and President Trump will come up with a way to get Mexico to pay for the Wall. Maybe an excuse tax on all remittances sent to Mexico, it is of course their second largest source of income, second only to oil.

The Saudis too. They owned our Government.

1568 2018-04-05 20:56:57 Does anyone doubt that Scott Pruitt had that soundproof phone booth built so he could surreptitiously conspire with his benefactors in the oil, gas, coal and agrochemical industries to make all their wishes come true? #BootPruitt #EPA #DrainTheSwamp #TheDrainIsSwamped
1569 2018-04-05 20:56:49 We want Pruitt out of our EPA because he could care less about the environment and is bought and sold by the oil industry. Just like Ted Cruz. And who were you whom bought and sold by David?  The Russians or are you just a Russian bot?
1570 2018-04-05 20:56:47 i thought my oil cartridge was done so i pulled on my pen for fun but i ended up taking a huge ass pull and now i feel nice so that’s how my thursday is going

1580 2018-04-05 20:55:45 I suggested oil in our water supply was a problem, wise one.

Why waste any natural resource?  We have the technology to refine the stuff and it is just sitting there. Absolutely use clean technology and strict emissions standards.

We all know nuclear is the future.
1581 2018-04-05 20:55:43 NOT AN ONION IN SIGHT - enriched corn meal, vegetable oil, salt, corn starch, soy flour, sugar, corn flour, onion powder, ... hydrolyzed soy protein, monosodium glutamate, dextrose, caramel color... natural flavors, garlic powder, turmeric, gum arabic, and extractives of onion.
1582 2018-04-05 20:55:28 We know that however it looks to the CPC, that's how it isn't. Because when you govern you're no better than the Libs, run shit into the ground the same way. You play politics for power and it's an insult to Canadians with brains. CPC can't save AB oil either, and proved it.

1594 2018-04-05 20:53:29 I have some "spiritual" friends who shared top secret info that cannabis oil treats cancer, obesity, Alzheimer's and pretty much every other problem. Doctors and governments are hiding this fact, because they just don't want people to get well.

LBJ didn't have enemies like Hoover, Mafia, Military contractor's who wanted Vietnam, Texas oil men and CIA. Would JFK have been sworn in 3 hours after hit #JFK
1605 2018-04-05 20:52:18 "Mr. Pruitt has advanced one of the administration’s most aggressive regulatory rollbacks, including regulations intended to tighten rules related to coal-burning power plants, oil and gas drilling, auto and truck air emissions, and pesticides."
He's toxic, and so is his agenda.

1649 2018-04-05 20:46:58 You would have to look at the reasons for why that is starting to occur. I grew up in rural Alberta where skipping on school to work in energy sector making 100k a year was seen as a positive. (Of course energy sector hit hard in past few years due to plummeting oil prices)

1658 2018-04-05 20:45:44 so y’all know i’m at walmart and i’m waiting for my oil change and this guy is asleep....he is snoring loud omgi can’t with y’all

1663 2018-04-05 20:44:49  this reminds me of the time I asked jensen if he uses beard oil and he WENT OFF so enthusiastic about beard care & naming products & how he arrived at the one he liked. He does not like a scented beard 
1664 2018-04-05 20:44:47 A4 #beechat I dont like using cocoa butter or coconut oil on my lips and face. It does nothing for me
1665 2018-04-05 20:44:43 Buy organic Castor oil & apply on lashes. Have been using it for a year now, lashes have grown thick & long & look fantastic when I wear mascara. Also without. Falling problem gone.
1666 2018-04-05 20:44:02 Seems to be a common practice in anime(Pretty sure every Dragon Ball show, except maybe GT, did this at the end of some episodes), but my best guess is either traditionally drawn and colored(with maybe oil pastel?) or digitally colored with some specific brushes.

1680 2018-04-05 20:42:42 It's possible that you will think intensely on this but feel it's a  trivial little matter for a while. It brings about an unpredictably positive way of thinking or feeling about problems. Let me know how it goes. Try cannabis oil. Euphoria lasts 4 - 5 hours
1681 2018-04-05 20:42:41 Many people doubt #Jesus has the authority to tell us how to live. In Biblical times, it was common to anoint those who were given authority. For example, #Exodus 29 tells us Aaron was anointed with anointing oil to serve as the High Priest. Acts 10 ...

1698 2018-04-05 20:40:17 Depends how you look at it. Westminster has clearly shown itself to be crap at handling Scotland's economy, which includes Scotland's oil wealth. It's easily arguable an independent Scotland would have made a better job of it. If Scotland leaves now, rUK is indeed knackered.

1703 2018-04-05 20:39:45 What I'm saying is, it's a trade off. While they can claim to have a high standard of clean living, and they do, they harvest and export oil that makes them rich enough to afford all of their fancy green energy stuff. They hurt the environment far more than they help it.

1712 2018-04-05 20:39:08 Cantu has sooo much coconut oil which I don’t think is nice for hair cos it has so much protein, like it over processes your hair so it’s brittle. 

Try something more moisturising with shea butter or olive oil 
1713 2018-04-05 20:39:01 Yes low tech version helped in the past. Just a mirror between my legs. I favour inhaling lavender oil scent and lying completely still now. It usually settles over a few hours and I can sleep then

Carbon pricing affects behavioral changes “at the margins” – what does that mean in practice?
Poor people can’t afford heating oil, so they use less. People would rather ignore climate change than not have basic heating.  But./

1804 2018-04-05 20:29:46 No thanks. We already have way too many wind turbines in ND. They are huge, noisy, bird-killing eye sores. They would not make economic sense but for taxpayer subsidies. You Iowans can have ours since you like them so much. We'll keep our oil & coal though.

1807 2018-04-05 20:29:39 my oh my.  Ms. Draviss does seem to be involved in this, doesn't she.  Wonder just what all could be her involvement in &/or awareness of Pruitt/oil boys shenanigans, too?
1808 2018-04-05 20:29:11 Bruh oil field
1809 2018-04-05 20:29:04 Also, you probably want to dig deeper and see if all the tax overhaul benefits are included in that chart, as most of the "big oil" stocks got big tax breaks that pumped up earnings. Depends on how that chartist is defining "profits".
1810 2018-04-05 20:29:02 I ask@BootsUK to ditch krill oil products because they are threatening the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. Are you an ethical retailer that believes in protecting the Antarctic and our planet?

1826 2018-04-05 20:27:33 I always just called it "olive oil" when I tried to mail alcohol. And had it already packed and taped up, and tried to bag the bottles so that if they broke it wouldn't leak and bring scrutiny.

1835 2018-04-05 20:26:28 Liar, we still import oil from then and ship many 10s of thousands of barrels of distillate so their oil production continues. Chavez, Castro and Maduro are 100% to blame for the conditions there. I have had personal contact with a number of people there. Liar, story teller.

1885 2018-04-05 20:21:38 No. It doesn't cause anything. It heightens the feelings of what was already a preoccupation of your mind.

1901 2018-04-05 20:19:30 Yesterday I wasn' able to fix an impression that Chinese people have about saudi. NOT EVERY SAUDI IS FREAKIN RICH. We might have an extra income for selling oil but that doesn't go into our bank accounts. Yet they would still tell me .."Oh commonn u riiiiichhh".
1902 2018-04-05 20:19:30 I always forget how much clove oil sucks until I have to use it.
1903 2018-04-05 20:19:10 I think the same and I wonder if there are no new ideas in this field(eg based on the macrocycle chemistry) or the oil lobby inhibits these ideas. Maybe first we must undergo a fundamental change in relation to the economic and social system.
1904 2018-04-05 20:18:59 oh!イル
1905 2018-04-05 20:18:59 Niks. Maar dit lijkt mij het juiste moment om wat los te trekken. Ik begin met een nozem oil
1906 2018-04-05 20:18:53 You are going to come to Fort Mac and talk about how you climate change plan is killing oil industry? You are the worst PM ever and Canadians are paying more taxes than ever.
1907 2018-04-05 20:18:49 That’s going to be painful if their losses effect the taxable income. It happened here when oil dropped off a couple years ago the city had to make cutbacks. But that was supply and demand not a moron.

1909 2018-04-05 20:18:33 Its not that difficult to ask African politicians who claim to have "power" on what exactly do they control since none can claim to control the oil,gold,coffee,platinum so what "power" do they have as cant even set a price for some of the basic materials only found in Africa

1911 2018-04-05 20:18:22 Why not? Pruitt was a crook in Oklahoma expanding his AG budget while taking away funding from education just to file lawsuits on behalf of Oil&Gas. That's how he got the EPA job, stealing on a professional level in every way. He'll do whatever Trump wants; eliminate FBI, CIA

1914 2018-04-05 20:18:12 I have to say, I switched back to olive oil because of health concerns. It is a saturated fat, so there is debate about the health benefits and risks
1915 2018-04-05 20:18:04 cbd oil & lavender oil! healthy lifestyle changes in your diet and exercise routine :)
1916 2018-04-05 20:18:04 He doesn't care about the grift & scandals, the paranoia or the rest. He cares that Pruitt has aggressively dismantled Obama regulations to let oil companies make more $. He's done more to rip apart Obama era regs than anyone else. That's what matters to Trump.

1923 2018-04-05 20:16:59 Let's get the pipeline done so we can stop giving every fifth barrel of oil away for FREE (a 20% $ reduction).   A North American price that matches a Global price will induce conservation & generate new tech to keep & grow GREEN jobs here versus exporting them.
1924 2018-04-05 20:16:46 You could try an oil cleanser as well? Even for oily skin they're supposed to be good for pulling out toxins without sapping skin of moisture. I had a sample from lush I really liked, and you only need a tiny bit so the sample has lasted me forever !!

1927 2018-04-05 20:16:33 Thank you for reminding me yet again why NOT to cook with heated oil. How about avocado oil?  ...It claims to be safe to use at higher temps, up to 500 degrees. Do you agree? @SusanLandeis
1928 2018-04-05 20:16:28 just wanna be covered in oil soaking up the sun with a cocktail in my hand
1929 2018-04-05 20:16:25 Our leaders are a reflection of our society.

It is why, even though I try to hold them accountable, I do not blame them for the state of things.

The real power lies with the people, but we have exchanged it for rice and oil.
1930 2018-04-05 20:16:19 Yes the oil and garlic pizza is vegan as well.
1931 2018-04-05 20:16:15 Because he is a corporate gas and oil shill who would sell his children for a buck.
1932 2018-04-05 20:16:00 I’ve been an oil maker for 8 years and this is the first time I’ve ever had this said to me. No, you CAN’T unpack my box of 200 carefully packed oils to look at them. What. The. Hell.

1934 2018-04-05 20:15:55 Just realized how much I emotionally leaned on coconut oil for some of those darker winter days
1935 2018-04-05 20:15:50 Probably because the stew is soaked in oil
1936 2018-04-05 20:15:38 Nice! Strong oil plays.

1949 2018-04-05 20:13:55 Just do a hair mask once a week with pure extra virgin coconut oil, massage it onto damp hair then leave for a couple of hours then wash with normal shampoo and conditioner! Best thing ever
1950 2018-04-05 20:13:37 Yeah but I don't think oil contains the same nutrients as meat, and I don't want to use a bottle of oil in every dishes
1951 2018-04-05 20:13:35 Hi sorry new to this: I use baby oil and water then pat dry
1952 2018-04-05 20:13:26 Did anyone ask if this was legal? What would happen if mexico decides they need some texas oil..

1958 2018-04-05 20:12:32 Hey Reba! To meet the needs of more of our guests, the Waffle Fries and Hash Browns are cooked in canola oil; however, because each of our locations are individually owned and operated, please confirm the use of canola oil with the Team Members assisting you.
1959 2018-04-05 20:12:29 either but you need a good inch of oil if shallow frying, marinade and press is also good
1960 2018-04-05 20:12:21 I don’t think oil and gas can be replaced by renewables because every solar and wind farm is paired with gas. They have to be because solar and wind are intermittent and we need to keep the lights on somehow.

1965 2018-04-05 20:11:51 @VictoriasSecret why can’t I find the ‘oil sleek’ product on your website to leave a review? I need everyone to know it’s a great product but the pump and bottle you put it in is complete shit.
1966 2018-04-05 20:11:46 NOT YET. I got a clean-shaven Jack McDowell and Oil Can Boyd, though.
1967 2018-04-05 20:11:41 and if someone such as yourself doesn't understand it, what chance do I have with my 3rd grade accounting degree?  I have to be honest Numbers, on this one, I bought it cause  BD likes it so well.  Mostly I trade oil options.

1970 2018-04-05 20:11:28 1.Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. ...
1971 2018-04-05 20:11:28 If you’re making Mexican rice don’t stir it too much. Once you put it on the pan with oil to fry let it get brown from one side and then move it maybe twice. If you stir it too much the rice breaks and that’s how you get mushy rice.

1974 2018-04-05 20:11:23 Gonna dismiss your rendition of tea tree oil 
1975 2018-04-05 20:10:49 The US has always have oil to extract.  The point is, it was cheaper to buy it from ME than to pump it out.  Dont forget,  some oil is very easy to extract,  some you need to use energy to get it and thats makes it expensive, cant compete
1976 2018-04-05 20:10:46 Make this oil dry or lose all the values left.

It's a curse.

1995 2018-04-05 20:09:09 CBD oil, but it doesn't dumb you down. It helps you function better and care less about bullshit.
1996 2018-04-05 20:08:59 I started smoking CBD oil recently and I feel amazing every day. Focused, relaxed, anxiety lowered, and (a little) less awkward to talk to.
1997 2018-04-05 20:08:50 And aren't those  "snapper"?
1998 2018-04-05 20:08:39 You may be right. I voted for Hillary; She was clearly the best choice although not an ideal candidate. I think most of us want a president who is not beholden to Big donors, ESPECIALLY Wall Street (G&S) , Big PHARMA, The NRA and Monsanto. Oh; and Russian Oligarchs and Saudi Oil

2000 2018-04-05 20:08:33 @SaudiVision2030 Windshine Electric generators are the next transformational design in electric power production. Many factories will be needed to produce. Better than oil in the long run as future revenues. Could partner with Boeing Horizon X project as it is a true wind turbine
2001 2018-04-05 20:08:30 I doubt there was any security threat to Pruitt until he began using  taxpayer dollars as his personal Mad Money, which pissed people off.

Either that or he's done something that Vlad and the Oligarchs aren't happy about.  Maybe something to do with Oil?

2057 2018-04-05 20:02:49 Gini coefficient is a number that showcases economic inequality. Alberta has one of the highest, driven by high reliance on oil and gas industry that employs relatively fewer and is extremely volatile #PIAConf
2058 2018-04-05 20:02:48 Local friends... my hemp oil arrived if anyone needs it
2059 2018-04-05 20:02:45 That ermine-gland oil in an hour and a tiny little security protocol 916, I'm sorry, uh...
2060 2018-04-05 20:02:42 coconut oil
2061 2018-04-05 20:02:34 OIL DIFF: 5.2 -> 5.18
2062 2018-04-05 20:02:33 Have you tryied mixing some tea tree oil with your mosturizing before going to sleep? I have normal/dry skin so I don't know anything about oily skin but I know that t.t.o. do something like "disinfecting". Let me know so I will tell to my sister, she have normal/oily skin! 
2063 2018-04-05 20:02:23 Got local cattleman friends & ones on here, they R not the problem & have no problem w/me. Some others misunderstand. I have a problem with #ProtectTheHarvest #ForestLucas Dedicated 2 restart horseslaughter in US. Corporate cattleman/oil tycoon. Peta pushes vegan more than abuse
2064 2018-04-05 20:02:14 Perfect. So what is the impact of leakage on the primary metals business then, or agriculture, or oil & gas and by region too if you have it. 

I have quoted the Navius figure myself but I do appreciate the extra detail. 

As you know what I have called for is sectoral study.
2065 2018-04-05 20:02:12 But then my Oil Slick ability would be PERFECT!
2066 2018-04-05 20:02:09 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic-Come on Boots don't drag your feet on this one! Ditch Krill Oil Products NOW!
2067 2018-04-05 20:02:08 What's the EU superpower doing about Turkey's warships blocking an EU member Cyprus drilling for oil in its EEZ? Absolutely nothing.
2068 2018-04-05 20:02:02 Very disappointed that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from feeding grounds of whales and penguins
@BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic
2069 2018-04-05 20:02:01 EPA is looking more like the environmental pollution agency now that its protecting the oil industry
2070 2018-04-05 20:01:59 There is also a natural leeching process that has been going on for millennia into the Athabasca. Some would say conducting oil sands operations is one of the largest enviro clean-up activities ever undertaken.

2072 2018-04-05 20:01:53 I really wish the people who do my oil change really understand that idc about anything else that’s wrong with my car.
2073 2018-04-05 20:01:38 wo choro konsi oil field hy avi mein
2074 2018-04-05 20:01:35 Awfz668 concord location Walmart. Every time I go for an oil change “they find something else that’s needs to be done”
2075 2018-04-05 20:01:32 The truth is white Christians control the world by the international bar assoc. Does anyone find that strange. One would think each country would be independent of London's common law. No wonder they stole everything. They own all the minerals around the world. Oil, gold,diamonds
2076 2018-04-05 20:01:17 i got mine from a company down south called CBDbrothers - ive bought edibles and cbd oil from them and they're really good.
i dont think the h&b stuff is v good, i bought some last month and it wasn't strong enough for me so i bought some more from this company instead.

2082 2018-04-05 20:00:48 We have sufficient alternative technologies that oil and gas can be nearly entirely replaced by renewables right now. 

Would you support an immediate halt of all new fossil fuel infrastructure.
2083 2018-04-05 20:00:45 I can hear the oil cracking now.

2087 2018-04-05 20:00:33 Yeah I've used tea tree oil but only like once. I have it for my back cuz I have a skin condition :P. I have also tried witch hazel. Idk. 
2088 2018-04-05 20:00:32 So NDA got a fiscal benefit from lower oil prices yes but not so much on the inflation front ( but inflation has been controlled anyway and the fiscal buffer to a limited extent can potentially be used in reverse if crude prices spike further)
2089 2018-04-05 20:00:29 I need an oil change not $3K worth of upgrades

2095 2018-04-05 19:59:36 It would be entertaining to write some science fiction about the world today, had the oil majors gotten together in the 1980s and agreed to stop the climate crisis... Or maybe that's a sitcom?
2096 2018-04-05 19:59:31 We deal on palm kernel oil extraction
2097 2018-04-05 19:59:30 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic - Please ditch your ideas on using and selling Krill Oil products - there is really no need for this in your stores.  You have plenty of other items that can do the job just as well.  Please think of the environment, whether on land or in the oceans.
2098 2018-04-05 19:59:18 Looking like an oil painting
2099 2018-04-05 19:59:11 This has been a long time coming.  Getting the Conservative Party appointees out and Liberal Party appointees in will protect our land from oil pipeline construction.   Sustainable energy that's clean energy will replace dirty energy from greedy people.  Keep Canada beautiful.
2100 2018-04-05 19:59:07 Simple. Because jaitley ji increased taxes :) And UPA didnt pass on oil price increases ( diesel/LPG) for most of its term :)

2104 2018-04-05 19:58:40 Because its not true. Wages are standardized among union jobs and minimum wage bullshit work. The gap comes from the fact men do harder work. Especially in NL; oil field, forestry, construction, etc. Theres a reason men dominate harder jobs: muscles.
2105 2018-04-05 19:58:39 I saja la test oil dia tadi dekat Watson. Wangi jugak. Tu yang kompiden sikit letak dekat rambut tu. Hehehehehe. Kita try dulu tengok cemana.

2107 2018-04-05 19:58:31 No such thing environmental safeguards oil spills. double speak for oil corporations. Just matter of time before major one happens on are coast. 340 more oil tankers a year in BC is madness.

2112 2018-04-05 19:57:50 Venezuela has a Trump type dictator in power right now who is actually responsible for the ruin who was most likely supported by the U.S. It's all about the oil and who will control and profit from it. 
Cheap RW talking points are so obvious and irrelevant.
2113 2018-04-05 19:57:46 What about the national prayer breakfast, cia speech, round table w/ small business talking about oil, I’m telling you the man is insane!

2115 2018-04-05 19:57:35 @harshijoshi Thanks for your kind follow. Returned the favor. The US & other Nations in the World have made many environmental improvements to get away from Oil, Gas, Coal & any Nuclear still online replacing them with clean non-health robbing Solar, Wind & Geothermal Energies.

2118 2018-04-05 19:57:14 Including Trump's fantastic plans for making us energy independent, we are researching for new ways of developing energy. But, libnuts want you to believe it's all coal and oil! #democratsarehypocrites
2119 2018-04-05 19:57:10 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic Please stop using Krill Oil as other shops have already done.
2120 2018-04-05 19:57:09 My baby is having a good week. She got detailed, washed, oil changed and got her rear end light fixed. 
2121 2018-04-05 19:57:07 Down rub beard oil on it and call me Obama
2122 2018-04-05 19:56:55 Not that sir, this administration took over when oil prices were in their lowest in years, Hence a decline in revenue. it is only logical to channel limited resources into completing existing projects in other to av them functional to improving the lives of Nigerians.

you: what's upton

you: oh yes
2125 2018-04-05 19:56:40 Coconut oil is the best make up remover
2126 2018-04-05 19:56:37 @JosefSchachter How impactful is this? "Energy minnow Bahrain just found 80 billion barrels of oil, as much as Russia’s entire reserve"
2127 2018-04-05 19:56:35 You demean the status of a ‘Lord’. Very rude to criticise a person’s looks. You’re no oil painting and show yourself as a very nasty character.
2128 2018-04-05 19:56:31 Yeah try the cbd oil before botox!
2129 2018-04-05 19:56:30 Animal feed and soybean oil. They will buy them from somewhere else in the world. Brazil & Argentina will crank up production and I'd bet price would stay the same.
2130 2018-04-05 19:56:29 I’ve been using coconut oil mostly. Will get a good slather & follow right up with cetaphil face wash. Will repeat til it’s off then use ACV as an after-cleanse/toner.

2134 2018-04-05 19:56:11 Very interesting. So the next question should be why *didn’t* such a massive fall in oil prices reflect so much in the numbers.
2135 2018-04-05 19:55:55 Trust. É sobre o sequestro do herdeiro da Getty Oil. Baseado em fatos reais e tudo.
2136 2018-04-05 19:55:52 You are really beautiful!! Do you fight in oil?
2137 2018-04-05 19:55:44 They’re just tiny shavings of truffles or like,truffle oil but it has a GOOOOOOOD flavor and I need more
2138 2018-04-05 19:55:42 Sauna, meditation, ginger shot, MCT oil, a handful of macadamia nuts or pecans.
2139 2018-04-05 19:55:38 No you didn’t mention oil rigs, I did. Seemed like an there was obvious link between the 2. Both are energy producers & both have some impact on the environment. My point being the turbines, which have dealt with the bird issue, is the cleaner option & better for your concern.
2140 2018-04-05 19:55:37 vegetable oil and beach
2141 2018-04-05 19:55:20 Fine, start wheeling barrows of rock instead of work a cash register, and you too can make up that missing 34 cents. Get into trades, instead of childcare. Work an oil patch instead of cleaning toilets. The pay gap is fair because biology gives men more muscle to do harder jobs.
2142 2018-04-05 19:55:16 I think there is something more there.. Russian oil and money was all that was needed for Trump to sell America off to Putin.

2146 2018-04-05 19:54:53 One reason Israel gets so much foreign aid is that Israel gave up $180B in oil it discovered in the Sinai when it returned the territory (91% of the land captured in 1967) to Egypt in exchange for a peace agreement.

Solar is going to be king and Trump just made it’s future that much more difficult in this country.
Oil is a thing of the past.
You are a master of short term thinking.
2189 2018-04-05 19:50:33 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.

2196 2018-04-05 19:49:50 Indonesia Has Declared a State of Emergency as Borneo Oil Spill Spreads
2197 2018-04-05 19:49:42 I could just buy some to spray on other people?

ooh no, I'll look that one up, ta!

I really miss Summer by Kenzo, that was summery and beautiful. I'm currently on L'Erbolario Argan Oil Perfume which smells of Rome and toasted brazils.
2198 2018-04-05 19:49:38 Free oil change, rotation & car wash for my baby
2199 2018-04-05 19:49:37 PCs have put NLs solvency into peril with a decade of drunken spending using one time oil revenue to increase the budget $3.5 BILLION from 2003-2015 and the Liberals just ran a billion deficit continuing the problem
2200 2018-04-05 19:49:22 bring the oil prices down. way to high and climbing
2201 2018-04-05 19:49:19 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…

2203 2018-04-05 19:49:08 Vaseline+ Coconut oil?  Night cream by first aid beauty
2204 2018-04-05 19:49:07 Great , who needs oil ? We doing great without it , no debts , jobs everywhere . Economy is strong as ever . Hopefully there is future in other sectors in Canada .?
2205 2018-04-05 19:49:01 Agree, if anyone can show me any other oil & GAS company that can attract BP. Cosl, Add Energy and Schlumberger with only a supposed few thousand bopd I'd be amazed. Plus fully funded and now an operator. Double figures is the minimum I'm expecting. #srsp
2206 2018-04-05 19:48:58 Oil is finite. Any policy that does nothing for research and development of future, sustainable energy sources is a waste of time.
2207 2018-04-05 19:48:45 We nedd strong leadership that puts our future and economy into clean energy.
Instead we have you cowards with no vision working for the oil companies instead of the citizens who voted you in and can vote you out.

2209 2018-04-05 19:48:37 You could have mentioned the coconut oil thing last week gif monkey.
2210 2018-04-05 19:48:27 Most important factor about eua option is that inventory of open interest has continuously increaesd
To 185,924 contract as of 4th of April. And  Implied Volatility of eua option is 54.51% higher than that of WTI(crude oil) option
2211 2018-04-05 19:48:20 Soooo glad Pruitt is rolling back requirements that would lead to eventual lessening of dependence on foreign oil, aren’t you?
2212 2018-04-05 19:48:17 This message is directed at @BootsUK. Please stop selling krill oil products which threaten whales, penguins and seals. We need you  to protect the Antarctic #ProtectAntarctic.
2213 2018-04-05 19:48:17 no problem. So here’s how I do it.
Day 1: shower in the morning, apply a dime sized ooze of coconut oil from the scalp to the tips. Don’t wash it that night or the next morning.
Day 2: you can wash it the following morning or night.
Day 3: don’t oil it.
Day 4: repeat the cycle!

2217 2018-04-05 19:48:00 Yes, they could've done that, but that would've been of benefit to the public and those that wanted to get rich from oil, did and would never allow the wealth to be shared.

2223 2018-04-05 19:47:21 Borneo had “world-class” response to its oil spill. Initially, wait, watch and hope it’s not serious. Southwest BC might be little different. When oil was dumped by a ship in Vancouver anchorage, it took many hours for authorities to begin addressing it. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
2224 2018-04-05 19:47:14 Just drink a bottle of oil and call it a day since you want over-greased food
2225 2018-04-05 19:47:01 One last panel discussing taxes in Texas today.  Oil and gas industry presenting their view of the Tax climate in Texas, starting with Bill Adair.
2226 2018-04-05 19:46:58 I don't mind silly beliefs like the Earth is flat; not believing in climate change however can and will lead to real damage. And then beliefs like Mexican judges can't be fair, Muslims shouldn't be allowed in the US or the US should steal Iraq's oil is downright horrifying.
2227 2018-04-05 19:46:48 Nope, I’ve noticed they use too much oil. Sometimes it’s the oil contents that when they go into the open pores some of those pimples start
2228 2018-04-05 19:46:42 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

Disgusting to use a vital food source for beauty products
2233 2018-04-05 19:46:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but illegal overstays.
2234 2018-04-05 19:46:08 Yes because it was already public knowledge decades ago, with scientific publications in the 60s, some of them authored by big oil companies. Everybody knew. Everybody is responsible for the mess.
2235 2018-04-05 19:46:07 Yes, this looks like a male Black Oil Beetle. @Buzz_dont_tweet would appreciate your record for their National Oil Beetle Survey.

2237 2018-04-05 19:45:51 I've volunteered at a VITA site for ten years.  I can crank through a simple return quickly, but that's because I've done it hundreds of times.  I also pay someone else to change my oil.  It might not be complicated, but it's not my area of expertise.
2238 2018-04-05 19:45:50 Here's the mechanism: Spot oil price are determined by current supply and demand plus speculation about future supply and demand in the futures market. Iraq war made speculators believe that future supply would be disrupted, leading to the beginning of the oil price boom.

2240 2018-04-05 19:45:38 This says it all: “He noted that oil and agriculture companies could benefit if the protections are stripped, as they are now prohibited from harming the habitats of threatened species.”
2241 2018-04-05 19:45:38 He has balls.  Unfortunately they are in the hands of the oil companies.
2242 2018-04-05 19:45:35 You been burning the midnight oil again?
2243 2018-04-05 19:45:32 Just sent in my computer for an oil change & tire rotation, & now I’m laptopless for 2 weeks. I’ve already reached for it twice. #LongTwoWeeks #NotWriting

2245 2018-04-05 19:45:16 Why do I always feel sooo uncomfortable when I come to get my oil changed 
2246 2018-04-05 19:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2248 2018-04-05 19:45:01 According to BLS, over the next 10 yrs, 16 of the 25 fastest-growing jobs will require postsecondary training. Of the 9 that don’t (e.g. home health aides, bicycle repairists), only 4 pay a livable wage & they’re in highly cyclical industries like oil & gas. IOW, #ReachHigher
2249 2018-04-05 19:44:53 Wind power depends tremendously on oil to run. 
Have to have diesel, plastics, oil base paint, natural gas...etc. before putting them up.
Diesel, plastic, and grease to build. Then have to have diesel, gas, grease and paint to service.
I’m sure that’s not all but u see my point.
2250 2018-04-05 19:44:34 All that oil, poor as #&$^, huh?

LOL! okay..
2251 2018-04-05 19:44:24 Dear @BootsUK please ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of w Antarctic #ProtectAntarctic
2252 2018-04-05 19:44:18 Correct. His family is in the oil business. But Conor is sitting on 100M.

2255 2018-04-05 19:43:54 i had no clue what tools they were using until I saw the video funny enough, let my imagination run wild when I started hearing the clanging. Oil drilling?!
2256 2018-04-05 19:43:46 No retailer should be stocking products that put the Antarctic Ocean at risk. @BootsUK as leading krill oil stockist, when will you step up and #ProtectAntarctic?
@BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic
2257 2018-04-05 19:43:39 You know the game’s in the bag when SNY is showing live footage of a concessions guy pouring oil in a pan #LGM
2258 2018-04-05 19:43:38 He is a snake oil salesman. I'd say car salesman, but I know many that are good people. He is a scumbag who targets the dumb because he is dumb. He can relate.

2263 2018-04-05 19:42:57 I'd MUCH rather have misuse of our military building a border wall in Texas than getting killed securing poppy fields and oil refineries in the middle east.
2264 2018-04-05 19:42:57 biospa's argan oil leave in is great, it keeps my hair in check for half a day but works really well for my white roommate's hair, which i think is quite similar to yours (blow dried daily tho, if that is part of your routine)
2265 2018-04-05 19:42:52 The Arabs didn’t even create the Arab League. It was the brainchild of the Brits in 1945 to solidify their control over the ME with its valuable Suez Canal and, of course, it’s oil.
2266 2018-04-05 19:42:43 All oil can catch on,fire
2267 2018-04-05 19:42:43 I’m hoping that Honda comes in clutch & doesn’t charge me for an inspection since I do get free oil changes for 3 years 
2268 2018-04-05 19:42:43 there’s a cute man changing my oil and I’m stressed that he’s going to see the stash of cosmic brownies I have under my passenger seat
2269 2018-04-05 19:42:42 You might be right and I wish your country the best of luck.  I certainly know how badly Siberia (Far East especially) tends to be neglected in spite of all of the oil and gas and timber coming from there but ending up as a fancy dacha or Ferrari in Moscow.
2270 2018-04-05 19:42:34 what Trump has done for American Energy Independence is amazing. Opening ANWR and and there's going to be drilling in all 48 Continental States. We're going to be the biggest oil supplier in the world. Trillions of dollars
2271 2018-04-05 19:42:30 Great idea to be protecting some of her ..... its almost pointless tho if they just wanna ban us fisherfolks and leave the oil and gas as status quo
2272 2018-04-05 19:42:23 Starting #congestionpricing will fight #climatechange more effectively than suing oil companies, so take note @NYCMayor
2273 2018-04-05 19:42:16 Alright #FBIARMY - its your time to shine!!! I already hear the gears of your brains turning. JUST BREATHE AND DON'T PANIC. I stocked up on edge control, glue and castor oil - the support team got you. If you need us, we'll in the corner eating popcorn. #ArmySupport #Euphoria
2274 2018-04-05 19:42:09 EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt - @EPAScottPruitt - When will you stop being in Big Oil's back pocket? Do what's right for the environment, consumers and American farmers. #RFSWorks
2275 2018-04-05 19:42:08 Oil made from blood? Wtf. How much blood would you need to render a cup of fat? If people are going to make demons up it should make sense! “After flaying the damned he fries them in their own rendered hides.” Now that works.
2276 2018-04-05 19:42:01 16 yr/o Tori: ah yes spf 4 tanning oil shall suffice.

2282 2018-04-05 19:41:40 President @realDonaldTrump - Keep your promise to farmers - support the RFS. Don't give in to Big Oil. #RFSWorks
2283 2018-04-05 19:41:37 How’s that oil money treating you? Without oil you cease to exist. #hypocrite
2284 2018-04-05 19:41:34 It's about pipelines always spill the life killing sweet crude.  Look at Montana and the river that was "cleaned up" after an oil spill many years ago.  Still oil on the banks of the river!  Still contaminating people and wildlife and plants.  And this was "cleaned up".
2285 2018-04-05 19:41:32 The result of the study will conclude a government takeover of the oil patch is required. As no one else will invest. Petrocan 2 so obvious.

2297 2018-04-05 19:40:39 Interesting article, but the teased-in-the-headline connection between increased funding and oil drilling revenues is...unclear, let’s say. (Or straight-up missing.) What’s up with that?

2315 2018-04-05 19:39:25 So you understand the economic impact of our oil being landlocked, but still gonna drop $186k of tax payers money to figure it out? 
2316 2018-04-05 19:39:09 any kind of oil by itself is hard to wash off that’s why you mix it together with a conditioner/mask (it’s the same thing tbh) because it will emulsify it, even if it doesn’t contains a sles/sls to create foam (shampoos without these are safer and more gentle for your scalp btw)

2320 2018-04-05 19:38:51 Ok, today's pitch for a restaurant special: Shrimp Scampi Pizza. So it's a pizza with garlic, oil, chopped parsley. Shrimp goes on later and bakes in the oven right on top. Maybe just some parmesan cheese at the end. Bone appeteet.
2321 2018-04-05 19:38:42 oil change yay lol finally
2322 2018-04-05 19:38:39 A couple of table spoons of gram flour and teaspoon of honey. I like manuka. Mix with water into a runny paste no lumps. Massage in, rinse off thoroughly and put on some oil of your choice to condition the ends.
2323 2018-04-05 19:38:36 This looks like an oil painting.

2327 2018-04-05 19:37:58 thank you John, he has faith, but too sick to pray himself, and sometimes my family and I pray together with a minister or priest whoever is at the hospital, we have had him anointed with oil and pray he can get off the pump they are using for his heart, thanks again my friend...

2330 2018-04-05 19:37:44 Very possible, although I disagree on consensus narrative.  There are still very few people that understand how the CNY oil contract makes it possible for China to control its own current account & prevent an EM BoP crisis...

2333 2018-04-05 19:37:33 Compare how the western based oil industry gets treated compared to the eastern based auto, aerospace and steel industries and you will see their is no favoritism towards oil and gas in fact just the opposite.

2335 2018-04-05 19:37:28 I’ve been using bio oil for 4 months and it’s done fuck all to my face
2336 2018-04-05 19:37:26 Yeah that might also work. Experiment with the barber using less of that lubricating oil, could be the cause
2337 2018-04-05 19:37:08 They love how he is dismantling regulations.  Oil, gas and coal.
2338 2018-04-05 19:37:02 the way to go is to have all three kinds ready to use at home. it’s the best to use oil on your hair after applying something that will prevent it from drying, let’s say it’s a base (it can be aloe gel (humectant), water+honey (protein) or i like using linseed gel (homemade)

2341 2018-04-05 19:36:46 @anasalhajji Anas, could you be so kind and help me understand what or why Cushing OK is considered such an overriding important factor/ storage location in oil prices?. Like for instance, this past week crude had a draw of -4.6mb but Cushing a build of 3.6mb. WTI stayed flat why

2354 2018-04-05 19:35:13 Efta is the ideal half way house to get your bearings, people would quite possibly just decide to stay there once they get used to it. You don't see Norway going for full eu with all the fish and oil they have, so efta then an eu ref would be fair. Imo
2355 2018-04-05 19:35:13 FYI putting your fish oil in the freezer helps reduce "fish burps".

2358 2018-04-05 19:34:21 yasss i’m happy! and i usually wear it overnight too, next time try mixing all of that with a conditioner so it doesn’t feel so sticky but either works fine for me!! when i do hot oil treatments i literally drown my hair from root to tip and massage my scalp for a good 10 minutes
2359 2018-04-05 19:34:20 What a ball from oil for ramsey
2360 2018-04-05 19:34:19 Wrong. Russia is going down with terrible highly centralized  management - all the money from gas and oil is been stolen. Ukraine, despite of russian occupation and russian terror, slowly very slowly, but going up.  It's visibly even  for me
2361 2018-04-05 19:34:19 I hate waiting for a oil change  somebody come to Walmart and sit w me until it’s finished

2363 2018-04-05 19:34:15 The need to make "shale oil" the primary reserve which is much lower quality than conventional oil is what peak oil was all about in the first place. Shale oil/oilsands is _confirmation_ peak oil is very real.

2370 2018-04-05 19:33:18 Or they can even sign u off for medical marijuana, alot of my patients said that worked. Or CBD oil. Which helps without the feeling of being high.

2383 2018-04-05 19:30:45 that’s what oil money does for a club, city formed in 2011 lets be real lmao.
2384 2018-04-05 19:30:40 Making it more difficult to transport oil into the province does not reduce oil usage. It just makes the risk of an oil spill greater.

Pipelines are infinitely preferable to the way that very same oil is making its way into BC: train.

If you want to use less oil, use less oil.

2390 2018-04-05 19:30:16 I agree with you and I am going crazy!!! Endangered animals, plastic bottles in N’l Parks, waterways filled with previously banned pesticides, taking of oceans to drill for oil.....Pruitt all about big corporations at expense of safety of ppl and wildlife!!

- The Capital market rated highest globally
2404 2018-04-05 19:28:42 I bet you use a tonne of oil.

The way to reduce oil usage is to reduce your oil usage, not to force the oil to be transported by less safe methods. Trains, for example, are less safe for the environment, and for anyone living near the train tracks.

2418 2018-04-05 19:26:51 So recently I've been trying to cut down my sugar intake, and my brain is complaining by having all types of (real and non-real) Reese's peanut butter snacks drenched in oil appear in my dreams.

2432 2018-04-05 19:25:22 per the article, in 2017, retirements were 32GW coal and 16GW gas, plus I think there was 3GW oil too; so add 51GW to the fossil number

2440 2018-04-05 19:24:30 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, and I'm a good customer but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

#US Non-Farm Employment Change [#NFP]
This event has very high impact on #stocks and #Forex but not so much on #US #Oil.
2442 2018-04-05 19:24:13 @VictoriasSecret bring back the body oil 
2443 2018-04-05 19:24:05 Maybe they read his blog post about the use of coconut oil.
2444 2018-04-05 19:24:03 I'm making Fried rice, I have Crayfish , stockfish , Palm oil. Egusi and Flour , what else do I need?
2445 2018-04-05 19:24:00 I just polished off the last of my coconut cream pie , 7 eggs , coconut milk , coconut oil and flaked coconut ... excellent healthy fats
2446 2018-04-05 19:23:58 Ive seen first hand what the oil can do its f##kin amazing
2447 2018-04-05 19:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
2448 2018-04-05 19:23:52 In Texas, everything is about oil.
2449 2018-04-05 19:23:44 Goes hand in hand with wanting us disarmed.
2450 2018-04-05 19:23:33 The next oil find should be explored and developed 100% by the GNPC. No ifs and buts.
2451 2018-04-05 19:23:32 just a suggestion  #MasterChef why not cook for homeless people??? or for people who use foodbanks??
2452 2018-04-05 19:23:23 Thursday: Get an oil change for only $9.96

Most makes and models!

2458 2018-04-05 19:22:59 Trump isn’t on anybody’s payroll, that’s why he worries them so much. Also America doesn’t need oil.

2461 2018-04-05 19:22:47 The entire Middle East can rot for all I care.  When we no longer need their oil we can let religion return the region to the backwards shithole it was before oil and will again be afterwards.

2463 2018-04-05 19:22:39 "#Trump says United States wasted 7 Trillion US dollars trying to topple Assad 
and will be losing billions more if US stays in #Syria." Seems all the oil they are controlling isn't enough to get money back.
2464 2018-04-05 19:22:39 Wow. I had forgotten how dramatic and terrible soap operas are. I have the pleasure of being subjected to one waiting in a smelly waiting room while getting my oil changed. Old lady next to me is glued to the tv.

2467 2018-04-05 19:22:15 can you imagine them talking to oil and gas like that? lololol. never. so you tell me who is extorting who.

2469 2018-04-05 19:22:06 Yo tb le insto a que lo revise y vea la manipulación de su compadre. Pone como pprtada del informe algo del 2009 y el informe es del 2015. Y además dice exactamente lo que Gente Oil  dice en su defensa. Manipular informacion es delito no?
2470 2018-04-05 19:21:58 spewing oil!  that's going to be a big number

2472 2018-04-05 19:21:41 Amidst looting of N1.1tril in Oil sector under Buhari,  abi?
2473 2018-04-05 19:21:33 I am not sure how an air fryer works but I like the idea that there isn't a great pan of oil boiling away. #FurryTails
2474 2018-04-05 19:21:33 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2475 2018-04-05 19:21:29 They’ll take oil out of anything and say it’s the healthiest fucking thing you can buy.
2476 2018-04-05 19:21:27 so we started giving my dogs this CBD oil that helps with their pain/anxiety (they’re both 15) and they become the most cuddly lil bebes it warms me heart.. they cuddle together on their bed.. cute old stoner dawgz

2479 2018-04-05 19:21:01 But they are spending $280K on study to find out why our oil&gas industry is slowing down!!! Oh the Irony! Time for #Trudeau and his alleged govt to "exit stage"!
2480 2018-04-05 19:20:58 @Neutrogena I’m disappointed in the lip gloss; still can use the sesame oil tho.
2481 2018-04-05 19:20:57 How about not going through with a pipeline and not visiting basically the headquarters for destroying our country AKA Fort McMurray. Less oil will keep oceans safe.
2482 2018-04-05 19:20:49 Did you know that in 1963 in Saskatchewan and other provinces there wasn’t a demand for oil?
2483 2018-04-05 19:20:47 This thread gives me all the feels....but mostly the naughty ones. 
2484 2018-04-05 19:20:47 I normally agree with everything @lallimusic says on BA's YT channel but, for real, I just watched her fry an egg in a stainless steel pan w/ olive oil &I was all, "Nuh-uh."
Did it that way for 5 years and never got good results. Went non-stick a year ago and I'm not going back.
2485 2018-04-05 19:20:45 Please @BootsUK if you value customers who do not want to be responsible for the death of so many beautiful sea creatures, ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals.  #ProtectAntarctic
2486 2018-04-05 19:20:43 Money.  Money.  Money.  That's all I see.  Twenty years (or sooner) when the money is all dried up.  Reality sets in.  Oil spill?  Oil spill!  We need a federal grant to clean up the environment. Money.  Money.  Money.  Meanwhile, sustained energy like electricity is less expense
2487 2018-04-05 19:20:34 Parallel: it's his party's only legislative "achievement" and the snake oil salesman recognizes that it's not winning him a single new vote.

to oil their rusted hinges.
2491 2018-04-05 19:20:10 I’m in utter awe at how disingenuous the Left is. “Oil is evil!” chanted with repeated fervor and expect the public to not glom onto the idea? #IdiocyOnDisplay
2492 2018-04-05 19:20:02 I have studied this closely and it’s actually a buck’s antlers...
2493 2018-04-05 19:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2494 2018-04-05 19:20:02 Imma follow you, like, a zillion times, k??
2495 2018-04-05 19:19:43 Will has that dumb graffiti on his chest. Good looking guy. Why?

2497 2018-04-05 19:19:41 I hope not! That shit is way more expensive than coconut oil.
2498 2018-04-05 19:19:38 I am endorsing this just as hard as humanly possible....

2500 2018-04-05 19:19:29 i just put some organic tea tree oil on my face , this mf got my face on fire 
2501 2018-04-05 19:19:29 Predictable, IMHO. Big Oil guys defend Big Oil guys and Cruz and Pruitt are Big Oil guys. But it sure does help explain why President Trump's EPA administrator hasn't exactly been falling all over himself to boost ethanol use and defend the RFS.
2502 2018-04-05 19:19:25 Who said something ‘bout oil, bitch? You cookin’?
2503 2018-04-05 19:19:19 Water, avacado oil, ruffage, may help stomach issues.
2504 2018-04-05 19:19:18 Surprised the US government hasn’t declared war on my face for the amount of oil on it

2508 2018-04-05 19:18:57 15yrs ago US invaded Iraq not because they gave a whatsit 4Iraqi people but because they wanted their oil. Any extreme fundamentalists there&in Afghan-supposed masterminds of NY's sep11 attack have been exponentially increased because they & their homes are being slaughtered
2509 2018-04-05 19:18:57 Many thousands have lost their jobs over this. Our business is construction-mostly in remote areas of Manitoba. Do you really think it's possible to complete any construction job without using oil and gas?Do you prefer we buy it internationally and have it shipped?
2510 2018-04-05 19:18:56 I just started trying to reteach myself how to use oil paints.

2512 2018-04-05 19:18:43 Jojoba oil is rich in essential nutrients that prove to be very fruitful for your hair. The high concentration of iodine helps to fight against bacterial and other fungal diseases. The vitamin E penetrates into the scalp and hydrates the hair.

2516 2018-04-05 19:18:32 What do u guys use to masturbate with, I have found natural eatable items that have great benefit-raw African Shea butter, omega oil,vitamin oils,zinc ointments, margarine, coconut oil unrefined, nut oils,ginseng preparation,aloe vera pulp gel.
2517 2018-04-05 19:18:31 Grandma & grandpa had an oil fryer years ago, and grandma kept getting little burns from the splashy oil. I think that might be why grandpa likes his new one so much, too.  #FurryTails

2519 2018-04-05 19:18:15 @JustinTrudeau I voted for you because I believed we shared the same concerns for the environment. I find it embarrassing that other nations are moving to solar and wind while we are still fighting over pipelines. Just because we have the oil sands doesn’t mean we should use it!

2533 2018-04-05 19:16:03 If someone out there wants to invent daily Fish Oil/Vitamin D supplements that aren't the size of horse suppositories, I'll be their first investor. *gag*
2534 2018-04-05 19:15:49 Thanks for being a stooge for the oil and gas industry.
Too bad you forgot you work for the people and we want clean energy not more dirty oil pumping onto our  coast.
2535 2018-04-05 19:15:45 $HK oil on fire. Expect more uptrend to continue. It breaks past 5.50, it will run straight to 6 bucks.

2539 2018-04-05 19:15:04 @BootsUK Would you ditch krill oil? #ProtectAntarctic
2540 2018-04-05 19:15:03 Again, you are ignoring every other variable. You can't magic up correlation. There's a pretty close relationship between US crude oil imports from Norway, and drivers in the US being killed in train collisions. They're also, probably, unrelated.

2542 2018-04-05 19:14:52 I don't know. Ask the families of innocents who died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of U.S. military incursions as to whether it was reasonable for them to be murdered. Or families of US soldiers in those conflicts who died over ideologies and access to oil.

2544 2018-04-05 19:14:33 The earthquakes are caused by deep wells where the oil pumped out 8a replaces by water. Not tracking.

there is no evidence of any environmental damage, earthquakes, polluted groundwater, nothing caused by tracking.

Just lots of liberal urban legends. Try doing some reading.
2545 2018-04-05 19:14:32 all you have to do is put it on a pot and add you fav seasonings and butter/oil and its amazing!!! soooooo goood!
2546 2018-04-05 19:14:21 Barack Obama is a skilled actor who used his profile and smile as a tool to shill for banks, wall street, oil industry and pharmaceutical companies. He is Hillary as she is Bush as he is regan and Bush Sr. They are all the same prototype Corp. Politician and work for the same ppl
2547 2018-04-05 19:14:19 This is a failure for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.  Yes we have three bodies of water surrounding this beautiful land we call Canada.  The village.  Oil spills happen.  Don't deny it.  Oil spills don't get cleaned up.  Ask the people of Montana. Check for yourself.
2548 2018-04-05 19:14:00 I made a chocolate shake with castor oil to put myself in labor lmao
2549 2018-04-05 19:13:51 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic please ditch krill oil,  an unnecessary kill and a threat to biodiversity!
2550 2018-04-05 19:13:50 @BootsUK really uncool that you’re still stocking products with krill oil in  #ProtectAntarctic I love your points scheme and want to shop with you as I always do but won’t until this changes. If Superdrug can do it, you can too.
2551 2018-04-05 19:13:38 OH, Fenty's shimmer oil launch is tomorrow.

2554 2018-04-05 19:12:59 @BootsUK I am disappointed to hear that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. #ProtectAntarctic and stop stocking these products 
2555 2018-04-05 19:12:57 Notice how these things never arose first in Europe?
- Wright Bros/planes
- Ford Motor Co.
- Standard Oil
- Silicon Valley
- Hollywood
- NASA

It was because of massive colonial wealth. Without our resources, it's back to the trailer park for you guys.
2556 2018-04-05 19:12:57 Not to worry. Bahrain will be liberated from the curse that is their oil and democracy will be delivered to nourish their souls. Hurray!!
2557 2018-04-05 19:12:52 I got an hour to get my oil change, gas, pack clothes, food, and be at work
2558 2018-04-05 19:12:46 I don’t remember mentioning the tar sands specifically. I was more referring to the Liberal policies chasing a lot of oil investment out of our once great country, thus eliminating jobs here while they pay for imported oil from other countries. #HowNotToRunACountry

2570 2018-04-05 19:11:58 This woman at sonic is complaining about changing her oil, brakes, and spark plugs for $54 and I’m over here crying cause I had to spend $427 for a wheel bearing

2578 2018-04-05 19:10:59 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2579 2018-04-05 19:10:47 SO much
2580 2018-04-05 19:10:45 Superdrug, Holland & Barrett and Morrisons have all discontinued krill oil products that threaten sensitive Antarctic waters. Boots, however, have not.

Calling on @BootsUK to stop stocking these products and profiting from the exploitation of the Antarctic. #ProtectAntarctic
2581 2018-04-05 19:10:43 Can’t blame him there.
 My eyes have been opened regarding the IRAQ BS, the lives and treasure wasted in the name of “National Security” in the Middle East verges on treason. 
We need to finish the job, bring our troops home and never import another barrel of oil again.

I think theirs a bit of corporate greed going on
2595 2018-04-05 19:09:51 I thought it was the other way around, that Syria/Assad was preventing Genie Oil=derp state oil interests from completing their pipeline to Turkey
2596 2018-04-05 19:09:50 But returning to realizing your literally worse than Hitler to the extent that u attack the African American for doing nothing to u EVER despite u needing their homelands oil. Most whites are not like that. I assume that is the Trump supporters left @Millenniel_Matt @PrisonPlanet
2597 2018-04-05 19:09:40 No, Norway manages very well with their oil fund, it does have poverty like any country but nothing like we do.

2599 2018-04-05 19:09:34 Does anyone have an explanation for strength in oil stocks?  Is the keystone pipeline back at full capacity?
2600 2018-04-05 19:09:33 Ocean's Protection Plan - that's where tax payers are subsidizing Texas oil corporations for the risk they pose to our waters.

They should be paying the $1.5 billion price tag not tax payers.   #cdnpoli
2601 2018-04-05 19:09:27 That's a lotta snapper going on in that photo, yada yada surf and turf joke.
2602 2018-04-05 19:09:21 We don't feel sorry for the "poor oil companies"! It is all the poor workers out of jobs because of the shutdowns and lack of money going to Ottawa to "donate" to provinces without oil resources!
2603 2018-04-05 19:09:16 I'm going to be starting off by doing oil changes filter changes and replacing light bulbs cuz I don't have a degree but they're going to train me to do everything but before all this I have changed axles brakes and rotors I can do pretty much anything if I want
2604 2018-04-05 19:09:07 There's a hundred and one different plans of attack.  Use whatever is necessary to keep our lives and property protected.  Stop these greedy subhumans.  Go Burnaby Go!  There's a river in Montana that had an oil spill years back.  Still not cleaned up.  Never will.  Stop the pipe
2605 2018-04-05 19:09:07 Well, I knew it in early 80's (born 1974). I'm sure all major oil companies new it as well.
2606 2018-04-05 19:09:00 But once the dollar decline further, if oil prices stay the same, local fuel prices should decline

If you keep them stable then you'll be much more energetic and relaxed at the same time, I really recommend it, and also eating much fatty vegetables (not pure oil tho 'cause it makes ur blood cells stick together = you suffocate like that), in general the "whole food"
2611 2018-04-05 19:08:06 Daily before bed I make it a point I visit Twitter just to see your posts. I only trade oil, like you . Please continue posting. At times, it's a validation of my entries..

2617 2018-04-05 19:07:35 Do you ship to Canada though? My issue right now, which I told the gf, is our industry is still forming as we speak so no idea where CBD oil will fit in the legislation and retail accessibility

2656 2018-04-05 19:04:11 Do they say why they use it instead of olive oil? As far as I know it has tons of saturated fats (that's why it's solid at room temperature). It does have helpful antifungal and antibacterial properties for that, eh, other use.

2706 2018-04-05 19:00:41 Not overall wins, but ROWs.

If Oilers lose both games in regulation, and #canucks win both, one of which is ROW, they pass the Oilers by virtue of having more ROWs. 

So need the Oil to get just one more pt for a guarantee they finish above #canucks.

2711 2018-04-05 19:00:13 So one of the ways to discourage Muslims from breeding like rats is for the West to abolish welfare and pray that oil in the Middle East get totally depleted.
2712 2018-04-05 19:00:07 Your assessment is correct. I read Farsnews when I really want to know how the War is going. Pravda reported Syrian guerllias bombed our Soldiers in housing they were living in.  Brits have showed up.  Oil fields. Syrian Govt stated they taking back all their territory. Map 
2713 2018-04-05 19:00:00 Thank you for being a candidate willing to bring this to light! Big Oil needs to be broken down like Big Tobacco.

2716 2018-04-05 18:59:45 @random_canuk 

Just like how when the cost of oil went back down to $50 a barrel gas prices went and stayed down at around 60-70 cents a litre, right?  Just like how billionaires always say "You know, what I have enough" and insist on taking less personal profits?

2730 2018-04-05 18:58:35 Hopefully it's in, and if they do sell off and oil can stay higher than it did in the bear market, they shouldn't be sold of as aggressively as when they hit their bear market lows.

2738 2018-04-05 18:58:05 Here's an idea for Canada
1. We refine our own oil
2. W move to manufacturing value added products
3. we stop being a country with a 3rd world economy and become a 2nd or 1st world economy
2739 2018-04-05 18:58:00 Lavender is good for relaxation I recommend cypress and peppermint oil for muscle relief. I personally used peppermint and it works. The sage is sumn like inscent u burn it to remove bad energy
2740 2018-04-05 18:57:51 Funny that a painting upsets you, but the clown in the White House disrespects everyone and pruitt is killing our planet so a few oil guys can make money. Try not being a hypocrite. We will respect trump, once he shows one ounce of respect for our country.

2744 2018-04-05 18:57:07 In reality, we see products and services that are pointless and useless see a lot of success in the market. It's not that it's snake oil, necessarily. I think, in a lot of cases, founders really do think their blinky box can make a difference. They rarely have data to back it up.
2745 2018-04-05 18:57:06 TXGOP is more stridently conservative statewide than TNGOP bc the money in TX is oil (usually leads to right wing politics) and in TN it’s medical or retail or even non-profit sector. TNGOP is fairly pro-environmentalist, for example.

2755 2018-04-05 18:56:17 If the world operated the same way I play video games there would be no pollution issues because I’d never use the oil since it’s semi-rare and I might need it later and can’t be bothered to risk waiting a while to get more

2764 2018-04-05 18:55:34 You just advocated for it again indirectly - decreasing cost of manufacturing. Its cheap to produce and the money saved by making the panels (not to mention exporting them) and passively producing energy outweighs that from importing or manufacturing oil.
2765 2018-04-05 18:55:27 I’m so happy I’m getting my oil changed tmrw.

2834 2018-04-05 18:47:18 No retailer should be stocking products that put the Antarctic Ocean at risk. @BootsUK as leading krill oil stockist, when will you step up and #ProtectAntarctic?

2836 2018-04-05 18:47:10 See today’s paper on Venezuela and Canadian oil taking up the slack.  I’m sure currency is a factor too.
2837 2018-04-05 18:46:56 Also I have read that we have oil companies investing in Iraq and other middle eastern countries that is a war zone, rather than investing here
2838 2018-04-05 18:46:56 Maybe you should be thankful oil is not found off Dublin's coast. Renting and buying in Aberdeen (because for some reason estate agents think everyone in the city works in the oil trade) has your wallet needing a triple-heart bypass
2839 2018-04-05 18:46:49 It’s ok. I’d like to watch it again and see if it affects me the same way.
2840 2018-04-05 18:46:47 My car is at the point where I go to get it looked at or even just the oil changed and everyone suggests I get $2,000 of repairs done and I just laugh in their faces. I’ll accept my cars fate when it comes

2844 2018-04-05 18:46:36 No pain! Our entire oil deposits is about 4 billion barrels! Bahrain just announced an 80 billion barrel discovery! It won’t kill us if we waited a little longer and got everything right! This is no child’s play!!
2845 2018-04-05 18:46:35 Uhhh yes coconut oil is awesome!!! Bus doesn't Dove use silicones?
2846 2018-04-05 18:46:27 @honda who decides which tires are installed in manufacturing? I was told how often I’d need change the oil and how much I would be spending. Sure wish someone told me about the (poor) lifecycle of their tires. #unhappycustomer

2851 2018-04-05 18:45:51 Perhaps the Saudis are accumulating $TSLA - and crown prince is in the Bay Area today for tech meetings - as a hedge against oil's dim long-term future? A smart future-proofing approach has driven much of the Kingdom's investments. Food for thought.

2870 2018-04-05 18:44:19 This is just such a sad time for this country. It will take years to undo the harm these people are doing. How many of these species will go extinct in order to benefit big oil?

2873 2018-04-05 18:44:09 This is my first try of the new clean range. I've tried the regular range before (+ the hair oil is a new try)
2874 2018-04-05 18:43:59 World control over oil. That’s why you pay 2.5$ per gallon.
2875 2018-04-05 18:43:54 And once it’s on I’m afraid it will never come off. Also do they sell industrial size containers of baby oil maybe that will help it go on hahah
2876 2018-04-05 18:43:53 Well done for using your status to spread awareness Katie!

2887 2018-04-05 18:42:57 In either case, it’s able to be applied in all the same ways as the base oil used. So it can be used just like coconut oil generally would be, it just now has the added amplified benefits of myrrh. It would be easier for you to look up myrrh benefits than me to tell you them all
2888 2018-04-05 18:42:55 grrrl get some coconut oil
2889 2018-04-05 18:42:52 I wonder if this is how my car feels when I don’t change the oil 
2890 2018-04-05 18:42:49 Fossil fuels will end.   By choice or over use.  I choose sustainable energy.  I choose a land without oil spills that destroy,  kill,  pollute,  contaminate,  never get cleaned up.  I choose solar.  I choose wind.  Don't cross Mother Nature she'll get you good.

2892 2018-04-05 18:42:32 You need oil?
2893 2018-04-05 18:42:26 Wait a minute. You live in Hawaii. You have no pipelines. All your oil is shipped in by tanker. Pretty easy to say use solar panels & wind when your island in paradise never drops below 70 degrees. You don’t have to deal with darkness & minus 30 temps in winter.
2894 2018-04-05 18:42:18 Great and timely article! Especially enjoyed finding out how oil is like whiskey.

2951 2018-04-05 18:35:47 Thing with nuts is that the compounds responsible for the flavour are not found in great concentrations on the oil and the solvents used to get the oil usually destroy the flavouring compounds.

At least that's my understanding
2952 2018-04-05 18:35:43 The discount for crude oil in the Permian Basin continues to widen. Midland WTI gets done at $6.10 barrel below May futures. To paraphrase George Strait and a Citi analyst "All our oil excess is in Texas."

2964 2018-04-05 18:34:10 Wow, North Dakota's is 3 times as high and there's CERTAINLY been no shortage of oil and gas spending there.
2965 2018-04-05 18:33:58 तुम मूर्ख हो स्मृति
पप्पू को छोटा भीम बोल रही हो??? अरे मूर्ख छोटा भीम हीरो है हीरो!!  अपने दुश्मन की तुलना एक हीरो से ? इसीलिए तुम मूर्ख हो। उसको शेख चिल्ली कहा करो। शेख भी बन जाएगा और बेवकूफ भी।
2966 2018-04-05 18:33:56 Everybody wanna get loud about their shimmer oil now that Fenty is dropping body lava, huh?
2967 2018-04-05 18:33:55 Oh and ain’t it an oil painting lol
2968 2018-04-05 18:33:48 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

2970 2018-04-05 18:33:17 And that’s responsible even with progressive principles. First of all, it’s not ethical to outsource slavery so that we can get cheap products and inflate out stock market profits. Second, it’s a waste of oil and adds environmental pollution to ship so many goods.
2971 2018-04-05 18:33:14 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarcticAs a Boots customer, I hope you will stop selling krill oil products. Whales need krill far more than we do,we've managed without it for all these years
2972 2018-04-05 18:33:12 Are people selling used cars stupid or ripoffs? Say you want $600 for an old car that needs normal stuff (brake pads, oil change, maybe even a starter) & high has mileage ok But if it has all that & $800-1000 in body work why wouldn't the buyer just buy a $2000 car? #usedcar
2973 2018-04-05 18:33:12 "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him." -Luke 10:34 #JesusIsGod
2974 2018-04-05 18:33:06 Old school chips work perfectly just introduce the oil after about 10 minutes
2975 2018-04-05 18:33:01 ".... a member of society who is actively striving to make us all do less harm."

No. He's a member of an activist group which protests about oil companies, oil extraction, pipelines and petro-chemical plastics but *depends* upon all of them.

In short - typical #GreenHypocrisy
2976 2018-04-05 18:32:55 Oh please, Pruitt has killed comprehensive climate science, pollution protections and lowered mileage standards to enhance Big Oil.
2977 2018-04-05 18:32:53 #MesaIncident: Report of oil spill in drainage ditch in west end of Somis. Investigation found not to be oil, hazmat team testing samples to identify substance. @VCFD
2978 2018-04-05 18:32:52 Shouldn't the oil be coming from his ass, tho?
2979 2018-04-05 18:32:48 I am disappointed to hear that @BootsUK is stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. I wonder what you would do if I sourced my health food from your fridge? #ProtectAntarctic
2980 2018-04-05 18:32:45 as if @BootsUK are still using krill oil, threatening the feeding ground and survival of whales, penguins and seals  sort it out lads #ProtectAntarctic
2981 2018-04-05 18:32:41 How does the oil feel about being changed?
2982 2018-04-05 18:32:38 Running the country same as Rez? 
The idea is so idiotic. Some win, some lose. It's the history of the world.
2983 2018-04-05 18:32:32 Why was energy east cancelled?  Transmountian  is another Government hold back. I am not in the oil field business so please enlighten the uneducated. I only go by what I read
2984 2018-04-05 18:32:28 寝るか
2985 2018-04-05 18:32:25 Oil change AMA, go
2986 2018-04-05 18:32:23 just spoil me with loyalty, just oil me in royalty
2987 2018-04-05 18:32:19 I love how you drew the fish flipping the bird, good one! And the pipe up scott’s ass with oil pumping out his mouth is genius jim lmfao!!
2988 2018-04-05 18:32:16 Guy, nothing tops what the government apex oil body is doing, but really, the Oando story was intriguing. Oil n gas industry is a total mess.
2989 2018-04-05 18:32:08 Chateau by Angus & Julia Stone, Pancakes by Lany, T R N T by Andrew Belle, Swimming In The Moonlight by Bad Suns, Snake Oil by Foals, ancient Names (Part I) by Lord Huron. Those are some of my favorites right now.

2992 2018-04-05 18:32:03 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2993 2018-04-05 18:32:00 @BootsUK  Please remove Krill Oil from your health supplements. #ProtectAntarctic
2994 2018-04-05 18:31:55 hb the truth that we have troops in the middle east for oil
2995 2018-04-05 18:31:29 I will take 28000 dollars and 28 seconds to tell them the reason. IT is your anti oil and gas policies stupid
2996 2018-04-05 18:31:10 Drop my car off for an oil change.. my front breaks need love FeelsLifeMan
2997 2018-04-05 18:31:05 once u start using coconut oil as lotion there’s no going back
2998 2018-04-05 18:31:00 .@Interior is soon expected to launch a lease sale for destructive oil and gas drilling in the #ArcticRefuge. We need to #ProtectTheArctic for future generations, not auction it off to the highest bidders from the oil and gas industry.
2999 2018-04-05 18:30:52 Oil and water do not mix. How silly to have allowed him into Government. Get him the Hell Out. Appoint a true Countryman! Be fking REAL!
3000 2018-04-05 18:30:35 Vet once gave me a tube of meat flavored oil based gel specifically designed for my kitty's hairball troubles. Licked it right off my finger. No nutritive value and worked wonders. Don't recall name of product though. 
3001 2018-04-05 18:30:26 If you want peace so badly...why don't you vecate POK according UN convention??? Bhade ki Victimhood leke barbaad ho gaye...aaj oil khareedne ke bhi paise nahi hai...

3003 2018-04-05 18:30:12 I use olive oil for my hair as treatment and then wash it with Orlando Pita argan oil shampoo and I don’t use conditioner after. You leave the olive oil in for an hour and than just wash it out it really softens and moisturizes your hair not washing your hair for 1 week helps too
3004 2018-04-05 18:30:04 Take it you don't have mirrors in your house, and before you open your bowel and speak out of your arse, yes I know I'm no oil painting
3005 2018-04-05 18:29:54 In three days we would reach the the wreckage of a detrimental, antediluvian ship, here we traded our cod-liver oil for ledgers.
3006 2018-04-05 18:29:54 I just had olive oil & sea salt ice cream that was extremely tasty
3007 2018-04-05 18:29:52 I feel very passionate about our world and believe we should do everything possible to protect it. Therefore I plead with @BootsUK  to show your loyal customers you also care and put an end to these krill oil products. Please protect our sea life. @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic
3008 2018-04-05 18:29:41 I like the Idea of boycotting Exon mobile but they produce 20% of our oil. This brings me to a protest idea; protesters are driving and just stop their cars where they are leave a note about mechanical problem and dead phone and left to get help. Millions of cars at the same time
3009 2018-04-05 18:29:20 My boyfriend randomly washed my car and took it to get an oil change and then took me to lunch  seriously don’t know how I got so lucky!
3010 2018-04-05 18:29:09 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
3011 2018-04-05 18:29:08 Also if cars could be made to consume a gallon of gas per mile so the oil companies can get richer that would be a bonus, pup.
3012 2018-04-05 18:29:03 Dropped according to what measure? Texas leads in GDP growth and job creation. Are you looking at numbers right after the oil collapse?
3013 2018-04-05 18:29:01 Boots, UK you have the power. ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
3014 2018-04-05 18:28:48 I'm calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground Antarctic wildlife. @BootsUK, follow the lead of other stores and stop stocking krill oil products #ProtectAntarctic
3015 2018-04-05 18:28:46 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
3016 2018-04-05 18:28:28 The world is asking that @BootsUK stop supporting products made with krill oil.  Will you take the ethical high road and #ProtectAntarctic?
3017 2018-04-05 18:28:27 okay I approve, don’t forget to put coconut or argon oil thoughout your scalp weekly too 
3018 2018-04-05 18:28:24 Lala Kara ra jawab milega..!! Oil ur own mashine apne balochistan ku dekho Jake kiya haal.. Indian kashmiris innocent people's are not fool woh sab samjh chuke hein.. Kashmir hindustan ka hein aur rehga.. Peeth piche waar karna toh kuch tum logo se sikhe.. Shame
3019 2018-04-05 18:28:22 Getting an oil change so let’s do an #AskJennaJ
3020 2018-04-05 18:28:21 LRT changmin didn't waste any time to look for his oil baron, i see. 
3021 2018-04-05 18:28:16 My oil change today has an estimated wait of 2 hours but it’s fine because me and the rest of the waiting room people are learning about dental care products.
3022 2018-04-05 18:28:08 Prices' beard oil probably has him smelling like a mechanic in the woods
3023 2018-04-05 18:28:05 اكيييد يقولون تمتن نشرب لين نتفخ ان شاء الله  #تشرب_مشروبات_غازيه_او_لا
3024 2018-04-05 18:28:00 Oil
3025 2018-04-05 18:27:55 My first order only had a few things like coconut oil and different teas and vitamins! But so far I love it and I’m really excited to get my second order!
3026 2018-04-05 18:27:40 He’s the oil on the chain. His only purpose is to be used and abused by the bigger components. Summary - he’ll do literally nothing.
3027 2018-04-05 18:27:38 I work in the oil industry in Alberta and deal with the regulations on a daily basis. There's room for improvement for sure, but that's not really the issue here.
3028 2018-04-05 18:27:29 Most prescription diets do a hairball version. If not, check if OK to give Animal Cod Liver Oil.

3030 2018-04-05 18:27:00 I wasn't sure! I have pieces that looks like that. I used acrylic too when I did them so idk why I asked if they were oil lmfao. they look dope though
3031 2018-04-05 18:26:47 I can’t believe @BootsUK is using krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
3032 2018-04-05 18:26:41 Putting taxes on carbon raises the price. Also creating the expectation of rising prices enables oil companies to manipulate public to expect higher prices and pay higher prices.
3033 2018-04-05 18:26:40 Just remember when we have a rail oil disaster that the Liberals, Trudeau and Butt’s are the one’s responsible not Harper.
3034 2018-04-05 18:26:33 Panchie my boi inno but that eternal oil he gah going kill somebody if aint done do it already

3040 2018-04-05 18:26:03 Cute! Love the oil, used the night before a competition leaves a perfect sheen that looks
3041 2018-04-05 18:25:58 @GreenpeaceUK is calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. #ProtectAntarctic  come on Boots.  sort it out
3042 2018-04-05 18:25:56 Literally as soon as I got home I opened all the windows and loaded the essential oil diffuser with peppermint help
3043 2018-04-05 18:25:48 Yea prob not a problem unless your white and have your property taken.

3045 2018-04-05 18:25:45 MR LIE MOHAMMED ASKING PDP TO RETURN LOOTS TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF THEIR APOLOGY TO NGRs IS LIKE ASKING HIS BOSS BUHARI TO RETURN #2.8b OIL MONEY MISSING! MISSING!! WHICH FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI SANG IN A SONG WHEN BUHARI WAS PTF CHAIRMAN.
3046 2018-04-05 18:25:40 OMG it wasn't only #ExxonKnew ?

LOL.. science since 1896 said #GlobalWarming from fossil fuel was inevitable so.. oil companies are GUILTY UNLESS PROVEN BRAIN-DEAD.  The 1800's mathematical calculations were PROVEN (roughly correct) by EMPIRICAL DATA" circa 1980

3048 2018-04-05 18:25:36 Omg really?? I might have to try that  it’s the new coconut oil, that’s for sure!
3049 2018-04-05 18:25:31 I will never understand how my mom can stand so close to the frying pan when cooking. I get hit by one tiny bit of hot oil and I’m on the ground crying.
3050 2018-04-05 18:25:30 I did not notice! Well you should oil your hair. Many who I lent my secret formula to, who have also lost hair during teens now have a great amount!
3051 2018-04-05 18:25:27 Distributed currency was just the beginning. Distributed data exchanges in an age and time where data is the new "oil" will be where the next great battle will be fought at. Haven't had something capture so much of my interest in a long time.
3052 2018-04-05 18:25:23 Venezuela’s oil sector may soon have new owners...
3053 2018-04-05 18:25:22 these look awesome news did you use oil paint?
3054 2018-04-05 18:25:14 WTI oil at $63.25/barrel, near unchanged.
3055 2018-04-05 18:25:08 I need to go get an oil change but don’t want to, someone be my life saver 
3056 2018-04-05 18:25:04 The lady doing my oil change is so bad oh my god 
3057 2018-04-05 18:25:03 The oil is sentient and knows your weaknesses. Throw it away before it evolves and learns how to control its trajectory mid-flight!
3058 2018-04-05 18:25:00 Oil positioning by leveraged money in '07 was at all time highs (on a net % of OI). Oil went from $70s to $140s thereafter. Not always indicative of peaks in markets.

3069 2018-04-05 18:23:52 Jessica posts,
 I am wanting to try cbd oil and just wanting to know if i buy it online does the doctor need to approve/know about it? Can i still drive or will it come up as cannabis on a mobile drug test?
3070 2018-04-05 18:23:43 It's time for @EPAScottPruitt to step down. He has abused his position & catered to special interests instead of serving the best interests of all Americans. Concerns of oil & gas companies cannot go before the need to protect the environment & well-being of future generations
3071 2018-04-05 18:23:33 The amount of Maya Angelou quotes in the replies is outstanding. The libs are self felating themselves because their echo chamber can now remain sealed
3072 2018-04-05 18:23:30 Tea tree is good for active acne not the aftermath. Get coconut oil because it's gonna help the skin heal naturally and restore desensitized skin
3073 2018-04-05 18:23:30 I need to take my car to get an oil change but all I want to do is nap lmao
3074 2018-04-05 18:23:23 Boiled yam is great with pepper sauce and egg sauce and even plain oil
3075 2018-04-05 18:23:16 This guy's drug bit wasn't his first rodeo with the law. On average a prison stent isn't delivered until a number of attempts at rehabilitation are burned through (Costly for the taxpayers). Then gets paroled, (taxpayer funded) blows that with state jail felony. Career criminal.
3076 2018-04-05 18:23:01 Satya vachan dube ji, abhi problem zyada hai, par zara tab ke crude oil rate aur ab ke crude oil rate bhi tweet kardo, saath main associated taxex mat bhoolna. Galti tumhari nahi hai, tumhari to fees bhi maaf kar di thi school ne, bole jab sikhaya kuch nahi to fees kaisi.
3077 2018-04-05 18:22:57 Have you stopped using oil yet?
3078 2018-04-05 18:22:45 The “left” continues to wonder why Republicans support subsidizing the oil industry with Federal and State tax dollars but then spew “free market” claims when it comes to other businesses.  Alaska has gone broke handing tax credits to this glutton industry.    #hypocrisy
3079 2018-04-05 18:22:41 I ordered rosehip oil and I’m excited. Has anyone tried it before?
3080 2018-04-05 18:22:37 I washed my buggy and got the oil changed today. I’m an ADULT OK?

3082 2018-04-05 18:22:26 Disappointed that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. @BootsUK When will you follow in the footsteps of Holland & Barrett, Superdrug and Morrisons and take a stand against the krill industry #ProtectAntarctic
3083 2018-04-05 18:22:20 My God.  You support the corruption he pursues?  Can YOU justify Pruitt setting up a $42,000 encrypted phone booth for himself? How non-transparent! Who is he talking to, oil firms sweetening deals for policy? Pay for play hidden?

3085 2018-04-05 18:22:09 I ended up just adding some greens and a bit of olive oil and baked it for a while. Not bad for scrounging up lunch.
3086 2018-04-05 18:22:07 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
3087 2018-04-05 18:22:07 The day they stop honoring gas and oil purchases, you can toot yer horn Jeffie. So until then stop your socialist propaganda
3088 2018-04-05 18:22:03 Analytics and coconut oil. That’s why

3100 2018-04-05 18:20:12 I've been enjoying all the happy hellos in this thread.

A happy hello from South Bend, Indiana from a desk inside a fragrance, flavor, essential oil company.  I plan on playing drum machine through guitar pedals this weekend and painting miniature d&d figures.
3101 2018-04-05 18:20:08 My first reaction is that the demand for oil is continuing to increase.  Perhaps there are other factors at play.  Exports maybe? who knows I have not dug into it that much.
3102 2018-04-05 18:20:03 Hope oil 
3103 2018-04-05 18:20:02 Do you suffer from dandruff? Seek out a shampoo and conditioner with an ingredient called tea tree oil!
3104 2018-04-05 18:19:32 With power out we had to back to basics at the farm last night. That ment warming supper up on the wood stove and getting out the oil lamps to eat by. Very quiet and cozy with no white noise caused by electric appliances running in the house.

3124 2018-04-05 18:17:18 I thought America and England wanted him gone when he planned on socializing oil production, then changed their minds when they found out how bad the Ayatollahs were. Kind of like how we back the Taliban when they fought Russia. I could be remembering wrong.

3135 2018-04-05 18:15:13 California towns are suing oil companies over global warming. I think that the oil companies should quit selling gas and any other oil products in those towns. Let's see what happens when the people complaining about oil can't get any.

3137 2018-04-05 18:15:05 Yes it the 21st Century defence of Bretton Woods, is what spawned both the Iraq & Libya interventions.

Saddam to trade in Euros & Gaddafi proposed the gold Dinar to trade oil.
That was enough to get them killed.

Only China been successful in (slowly) challenging the Petrodollar
3138 2018-04-05 18:15:01 he's the most nakedly incompetent and damaging to the institution he oversees as well. Big oil has reached into too many pockets.
3139 2018-04-05 18:14:51 The shortage of Oil, Gas and Electricity is causing harm to the national interest and economy of Pakistan and if these problems and challenges are not met on the priority basis; Pakistan’s economy can be in great danger of being destroyed.

3151 2018-04-05 18:13:31 Unsurprisingly, the oil and gas sector would prefer Carbon Pricing to supply-side caps. They would be as effective but more costly and spur less innovation.

3. Get behind young man, support him, encourage him.

3173 2018-04-05 18:11:01 The thing about running out of oil is we probably won't literally "run out." As the oil supply dwindles the price will go up and up until literally anything else is cheaper. That would fuck the economy real bad, but it's not like "bam! One day, no more oil!"

3181 2018-04-05 18:10:15 Because the price of oil is up. The answer to why the price of oil is up is a much longer one. But one would not expect that money going to oil companies would translate into money going to gasoline consumers regardless.

3219 2018-04-05 18:05:52 DJT’s objection to American militarism abroad isn’t that it’s too imperial, but that it’s not imperial enough. Remember during the campaign, his promise to sieze Iraq’s oil?

3229 2018-04-05 18:04:44 I woke up today with enough oil on my face that I thought the US would invade it.
3230 2018-04-05 18:04:33 It’s been a busy (and expensive) day. Bought 3 new tires, got an oil change, air filter, brake fluid, and a car wash. Is it beer time yet?

3242 2018-04-05 18:03:45 Pruitt has so many sketchy connections in the gas & oil industry that I wouldn’t doubt they sent lobbyist attack dogs to Cruz & Paul to order them to defend Pruitt and keep their interests safe

3283 2018-04-05 18:00:36 I tend to only wash my hair every few weeks, and it no longer gets noticeably oily in between. I’ve heard that your body adapts to it, and produces more or less oil as needed, and that does seem to fit with my experience.

3308 2018-04-05 17:57:48 It's not quite that bad - all signs are that even if we have passed peak oil, coal and gas are sufficient to feed our energy needs for the foreseeable future, at the cost of making other things worse (including climate change)

3321 2018-04-05 17:56:18 Have been using an oil cleanser for a week instead of face wash. Omg! Why haven’t I done this before. My face feels like a baby angel. 
3322 2018-04-05 17:56:18 True, 
I just have the image of an IRS SWAT team dropping in on a coffee shop for not claiming their tips.

3323 2018-04-05 17:56:18 Yes, for sure. I'm not using modernization in a literal sense in terms of useful upgrades in infrastructure.

Take action and retwit.
3332 2018-04-05 17:55:40 I think you should ask the many oil rigs owners that are moving to Texas to drill.
3333 2018-04-05 17:55:30 Now that big oil is in tight oil big time with long term planning and capex in place, dynamics of shale oil and gas changing quickly. Now that Rig counts stabilized and wells can be profitable even at $40 oil (or even $15?) & gas pipelines and export infra in place, future is ...
3334 2018-04-05 17:55:25 Yeah the rate of actual oil consumption doesn't necessarily go down after peak oil, and could in fact keep going up, as long as people on the ground remain ignorant of it
3335 2018-04-05 17:55:16 lol I would have said something probably not truthful, like oh yeah it was a cup of jizz mixed with de-ionized water. Let it sit for 24 hours, add some coconut oil and massage into your head. Some weird sounding fads for health from the last decade lol

3343 2018-04-05 17:54:28 I started reading this article and couldn't figure out why they would want to do this. Then I got to the part where it said that it would aid oil interests. Made sense then.

3353 2018-04-05 17:53:41 Scott Pruitt will destroy our environment for financial investment purposes. Yeah. Cut down sequoias, pollute the ocean with oil from increased offshore, make the air unbreathable. That's really making America great. And this is sarcasm for those too stupid to understand.
3354 2018-04-05 17:53:41 Roasted cauliflower with buffalo-honey aioli and avocado toast. Buffalo sauce is bottled wing sauce, dukes mayo, honey. cauliflower had olive oil and garlic then roasted at 350 for 30 mins in my convection oven. avocado, fresh jalapeno, green onion, lime juice, sea salt on toast.

3374 2018-04-05 17:51:38 I applaud your decision re: electric venhicles, but out of interest, what do you think your car is made out of? Oil/mineral products are still needed to some extent to create the paints, plastics, engine oil, window seals, fabrics, coatings, sealants, etc. We're not there *yet*
3375 2018-04-05 17:51:24 He has never coherently offered any way to pay for all that. That doesn’t even take into account political REALITY.  Snake oil salesman.

3381 2018-04-05 17:51:02 The Maritime Administration (MARAD) just posted a maritime alert concerning a incident in the southern Red Sea. A projectile was fired at a commercial oil tanker, resulting in minor hull penetration and damage above the waterline.
3382 2018-04-05 17:50:58 Job got a mandatory meeting later but fuck that . I need a cut and oil change 
3383 2018-04-05 17:50:56 Be owt come get this oil

3386 2018-04-05 17:50:44 Just heard someone on @NPR argue that passing legislation around data retention would force innovation similar to green tech with oil regulation. Not sure if I agree but it's an interesting argument. Seems kind of broken window fallacy-esque.
3387 2018-04-05 17:50:36 Idk I think it’s the time period in which I watched it. It made me think about someone I’d lost and it made me so sad.

3398 2018-04-05 17:49:36 Absolutely not. I think we should do our best to remove oil and coal from the equation. Very disappointed Trump removed us from the Paris agreement for no apparent reason.
3399 2018-04-05 17:49:28 Does no one in the WH know that the world and it's inhabitants create a delicate balance?

Are they doing this for oil? A non-renewable resource?

Hope Mueller hurries the hell up. These anti-Earth policies will take a generation to overcome.

3405 2018-04-05 17:48:48 Dear @BootsUK, I'm sure by now you get the message from us, your regular customers - please do the ethical thing and ditch krill oil products threatening animal and sea life in the Antarctic  #ProtectAntarctic . Thank you, I'm watching and waiting...
3406 2018-04-05 17:48:34 I dunno, if Bernie really is a racially dodgy snake oil salesman, wouldn't that have been super fucking obvious to everyone two years ago?
3407 2018-04-05 17:48:30 WRONG. NOTHING BETTER THAN A SAMOA. Something about the coconut and chocolate and lingering mouthfeel of palm oil or lard or plastic or whatever it is.
3408 2018-04-05 17:48:21 Yum! I’ve always used a drizzle of olive oil for almost everything. Gotta try this thank youuuu
3409 2018-04-05 17:48:17 Pasta aglio e olio

Spaghetti or linguine, garlic, olive oil, crushed red pepper, lemon, parsley, salt and pepper

Takes 10-20 minutes to make and is DELICIOUS
3410 2018-04-05 17:48:13 $nowflake Pruitt, stop poisoning our kids and go back to OK with your big $$ oil & gas buddies who may give you a job with the $$ & lavish perks to which you feel so entitled.

3411 2018-04-05 17:48:10 Guys: There was a time when we lost all the Iranian oil and all the Iraqi oil and prices did not move.  The events that matter, back to Mike's point, are those that wipe out capacity. everything else is noise.

3413 2018-04-05 17:47:59 Iii diiid I just needa stop washing my hair so often. Lol n no more 6in1 body wash. I put coconut oil in it after but I guess it's no use if I wash it out every night
3414 2018-04-05 17:47:49 Honestly, I think we could do BOTH. We currently still need oil to create the millions of products we all use every day, even if we are moving towards energy sustainability. It's not a case of one vs the other... yet.
3415 2018-04-05 17:47:41 Oil I can't help it if I need a little lift 
3416 2018-04-05 17:47:38 Puts me in mind of Big Tobacco. Perhaps big oil will have the same outcome????

3421 2018-04-05 17:47:12 Sabotage? Lmfao. The leak in South Dakota was shut off, but not after thousands of gallons oil spilled into a river and into an aquifer. Oh well, South Dakoka voted Rep. fuck em. I hope they enjoy taking a shower and drinking in oil.
3422 2018-04-05 17:47:03 Our co-founder Steve Phinney says, "Canola oil contains 65% monounsaturated fat, only 16% omega-6 (the pro-inflammatory stuff) and 10% omega-3, so it is actually a pretty good source of the shorter-chain (non-fish oil) omega-3 fat called alpha-linolenic acid."

For this reason alone he should be charged with TREASON for endangering Citizens lives

According to PEPCO  the shortfall in electricity production is due to reduction in supply of gas,furnace oil and funds.

3447 2018-04-05 17:45:36 Teachers don’t like working in schools that are falling apart. They also don’t like having 20 year old texts. Most of all, they really believe that education is more important than tax breaks for the oil industry.

3459 2018-04-05 17:44:29 I’m thinking there is a huge difference in promotion of the oil/gas industry to counter activist, by Harper. Verses Trudeau spending money to find out why oil/gas is failing. As pointed out, Trudeau only needs to look into the mirror as to why?

3466 2018-04-05 17:43:48 I'd say the beaches would be covered in oil soon but seeing how the governor managed to get a sweet deal from Zinke, that wont be happening now.
3467 2018-04-05 17:43:47 Could you recommend me a non-psychoactive CBD oil? And a place to buy it in the UK? Coz I'm done with this shit and I'm prepared to give CBD a go.
3468 2018-04-05 17:43:40 Do you think it is okay to import coal, import oil, import natural gas for Venezuela and the Middle East? Very costly and not regulated in those countries.  Honest question.

Just so bad for our planet and sooo unnecessary!
3477 2018-04-05 17:43:06 Oil discovery in Saudi Arabia was done by Max Steineke, an American petroleum geologist not an engineer.
3478 2018-04-05 17:42:50 Baby oil on any areas you aren’t worried about, areas you are worried about (face, neck, etc) banana boat oil with the low spf!
3479 2018-04-05 17:42:44 What the buck fact.
After shooting and escaping, spend some money through your charities to prevent the oil of public opinion from splattering and going against you.
For the rest, there's always the fan club.
3480 2018-04-05 17:42:37 The technique used by the Unionists & the MSM in the indy ref was the age old technique of concentrating on detail such as currency, pensions, oil revenue, the NHS & not on the principle involved. The White Paper anticipated & tried to forestall that but only with limited success
3481 2018-04-05 17:42:35 @SunAndStorm have you looked at earnings and forward earnings estimates for many oil companies? Far from BS...
3482 2018-04-05 17:42:33 actually no, it depended solely on oil, which had its prices plummeted, and international debt went directly to the roof,  you are too young to remember but it was the fairly remember  "defenderé al peso como perro" which never happened

3484 2018-04-05 17:42:19 Bought some oil & found an oil filter that (hopefully!) fits the shellsuit so should get the CBR back on the road soon!

It only takes the wisdom of God because these are spiritual things

3487 2018-04-05 17:42:09 USA’s fossil-fuel energy boom will be short-lived (already oilfields are gassier), b/c Saudis, China & their partners in USA will ensure that as much of US oil & natural gas are fracked & exported as quickly as possible, so USA will be energy-dependent on Middle East & China.
3488 2018-04-05 17:42:07 Make sure you moisturise after your shower and apply cream/oil while your skin is slightly damp to lock in the moisture x

3493 2018-04-05 17:41:45 I find it truly remarkable that Prime minister Trudeau @JustinTrudeau should travel all the way to British Columbia yet not have a sit down discussion with British Columbia’s Premier @jjhorgan about oil pipelines but will go to a fundraiser & visit the Suncor facilities on Friday
3494 2018-04-05 17:41:35 Clearly I be doing hot oil treatments wrong because I be having enough oil in my head to moisturize my whole body.
3495 2018-04-05 17:41:27 If it's not the government's job to finance projects why are there subsidies to big oil while they continue to pull in record profits. Follow the money....

3513 2018-04-05 17:40:04 We import a lot of oil.  Trump lowering fuel efficiency standards will dramatically increase our trade deficit.

3515 2018-04-05 17:39:47 6. For houses who burn oil for space heating, costs are high. Furnace oil costs $305/barrel – 1 barrel a week required in winter ($1,200 per month). This is compared to $200-400 if electric heat were used.

3519 2018-04-05 17:39:10 Roosevelt vacillated in his support for a Jewish homeland, not wanting to alienate the Saudis, whom the US was courting for oil.

The US admitted only 160,000 European Jews between 1933 & 1942, increasing the Jewish population from 3.6 to 3.7% of the overall U.S. population.

3525 2018-04-05 17:38:43 I drank castor oil again and now I'm getting a back massage. Y'all don't understand how I'm dead ass trying every "trick" in the book to go into labor lol.
3526 2018-04-05 17:38:35 I'll have to reread your document but it is counter intuitive that a province that has already reduced its emissions to roughly 1990 levels would purchase offsets from oil and gas. Is Alberta's cap (increase) on oil and gas emissions equitable?
3527 2018-04-05 17:38:35 ...pouring used motor oil down storm drains.

3530 2018-04-05 17:38:24 A big explosion would send prices soaring, but I expect only briefly as people realized impact not serious.  Boots on the ground still decisive factor, don't see them approaching oil fields.

3535 2018-04-05 17:38:04 True and oil will exist in the future, but how much oil is used for common transport and energy needs at the moment that will be replaced by more renewable resources.

3550 2018-04-05 17:36:33 Yup. But think outside of the box, not necessarily  an Italian pasta salad. To go with sweet potato you  could do olive oil/lime/cumin/coriander/jalapeño/cilantro. Toss with sliced peppers, onions, broccoli, maybe chopped chicken or black beans for protein, avocado.
3551 2018-04-05 17:36:26 This isn’t resisting, this is screaming reality at the top of our lungs. Sadly a demented snake oil salesman fooled his party and now they embarrassingly have to support him. Saddest of all, his puffery would be able to support all veterans who gave so much
3552 2018-04-05 17:36:19 This is a waste of money. This is in addition to the $235 million loan for orphan well program with $30 million to pay interest charges when this is not our liability. @OilGasCanada Subsidization of the oil industry has cost us big time.

3575 2018-04-05 17:34:09 So, can we stop expanding the tarsands now? Can we stop the building of dilbit pipelines and shipping dilbit off our coasts? As it is, it looks like the clean-up costs (that oil companies WILL NOT pay) will be more than all royalties to all levels of government since beginning.

3601 2018-04-05 17:31:45 The platform is enlisting the help of hundreds (hopefully soon thousands!) of volunteers globally - so not an in-house team as such. @milena_iul previously oversaw similar microtasking projects on oil spills in Nigeria & scorched-earth tactics in Darfur. Does that clarify?

3614 2018-04-05 17:30:37 When buying Olive Oil, seek out “extra virgin” oils. Avoid bottles that just say “olive oil,” or are “light” or “pure”......“Extra virgin” refers to the way the oil was extracted (it has nothing to do with the morality of the olives!). #HowToBeWell

The Petrodollar has been a well known system for upholding the value of the US dollar, after the US left the gold standard. OPEC has a long standing agreement to only trade US dollars for oil.

It is actually just that simple.

3641 2018-04-05 17:28:46 In the USA, the top four of five energy-export companies are foreign-owned—as are many of our ports.

Therefore, it’s likely that the US government has no clue as to how much oil, natural gas, oil byproducts, etc. are actually leaving our shores without ever being taxed.

3652 2018-04-05 17:27:38 Oil and gas companies will likely lead the transition to clean energy, but they will not act unless the economics of fossil fuel use is updated to reflect true public health and environmental costs of carbon, not to mention eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.
3653 2018-04-05 17:27:35 I didn't like that as AG he Sued Colorado and others when they passed marijuana because he thought it would cut in to Oklahoma's oil and prison profits.
3654 2018-04-05 17:27:35 Don't think he'd care. After all, solar panels don't use hydrocarbons for fuel, thus don't enhance profits for the oil & coal industries. Also solar power use runs counter to the EPA's goals, under Trump/Pruit, of increasing air and water pollution and climate change.

3666 2018-04-05 17:26:36 Ooo brilliant, thanks for the link! To be honest I didn't see what the inventory reports were saying but I'm going to assume that they boosted output and additional draw? WCS is down yet my oil sands and fracking services plays are both up. Hmm. Tech showing some weakness now.

3725 2018-04-05 17:21:51 FYI deregulation of Oil was UPA decision where they deregulated in a phased manner year by year. They did not come on radio midnight and said from tomo there will be no subsidies on oil. Tats called wiseness.

b) 3 of the others have just turned pro at the very end of their Draft+2 seasons with decent early results. A bit soon to judge them as misses, no?

3845 2018-04-05 17:10:47 My car was in the shop for 3 weeks and even though I asked them to they didn’t even change my oil and now my head is going to fall off from annoyance.
3846 2018-04-05 17:10:35 What was the market price of oil (main of income) as at then and now?
3847 2018-04-05 17:10:30 No retailer should be stocking products that put the Antarctic Ocean at risk. @BootsUK as leading krill oil stockist, when will you step up and #ProtectAntarctic?
3848 2018-04-05 17:10:23 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. I am disappointed to hear that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins.

3863 2018-04-05 17:09:19 @nitin_gadkari  Huge umber of vehicles are being misused in govt offices.This not only increases expenditure of department, but also waste oil,traffic congestion, parking problem, pollution. Govt can save all this by restricting vehicle hiring for individuas & use common vehicles

3865 2018-04-05 17:09:07 There is nothing wrong with reading and studying up on a particular gift, but the reality is...anyone can learn the “language”. This is one of the problems in the Body now, many are “learned”, but lacking in the oil. Lord, my desire is for the oil not simply to learn a language.
3866 2018-04-05 17:08:56 The next weather buzzword (like snowmageddon, polar vort...I can't even say it!) might be: "Wide Oil", "Spiraling Flinchers", or "Screaming Milky Way Fartnado".

3871 2018-04-05 17:08:18 DON'T DO IT, DON'T FUCKING DO IT AT ALL!!!!! They use that much oil, the US will invade your garage!

3873 2018-04-05 17:08:00 Im having serious breathing problems from these oil paintings. I recommend you guys paint somewhere open if you're using oil paints. And wear a mask if u can. I wasn't even painting I was just in my painting room browsing the web suddenly I cant breathe properly.

3877 2018-04-05 17:07:43 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products. The harvesting of krill is damaging the Antarctic Ocean wildlife which depend on krill for their food sources. We don’t need these products. @BootsUK show you care.

3896 2018-04-05 17:06:44 Did you see the recent study about isopropyl? They say that peppermint oil might work just as well.... 

I tried the isopropyl last time I felt sick, and it did provide relief (short-term, but it's safe to huff it as much as you like, generally).
3897 2018-04-05 17:06:43 Which is why there's a boom of sorts going on at Duvernay and Montney. We are absolutely awash in gas as a side-product of tight oil. To the point that no one is making any money. Fortunately, we're going to burn some for electricity generation.

3899 2018-04-05 17:06:40 It is always about the F'n oil. Ending endangered species ban is so Big oil can drill dig or drudge anywhere. Right now these are protected so big oil can't disturb nests and such. They will kill anything for oil.

3910 2018-04-05 17:05:07 What put Gaddafi at risk, was that he was moving away form the Petrodollar to the gold standard to trade oil.

Stop thinking that the decisions to invade & topple governments, has absolutely anything to do with altruism & human rights.

Gaddafi was toppled for cash, nothing else.

3918 2018-04-05 17:04:23 Well, at  least Putin doesn't want Syria's oil like the Deep State and others do, Russia has more than enough of their own, more than even America's.
Putin respects that Syria's oli belongs to Syria and no one else.
Russia just wants a good Meditteranian Port in Syria at Tartos

3984 2018-04-05 16:59:47 When Trump @realDonaldTrump complains about costs on overseas "invasions/wars", he forgets how much USA arms factories make out of it. Cheney invaded Iraq for the oil, which he stole, now it's money speaking again.

3994 2018-04-05 16:59:15 DNO eventuellt bought 25.4% in Faroe petr. Faroe Petroleum has stated 2P reserves of 97.7 million barrels of oil equivalent and  production of averaged 14,300 b/d. Think we will see a few more  small buys in by DNO outside Kurdistan in near future #OOTT

4013 2018-04-05 16:57:36 You don't seem to know what you are talking about? Pastrnak, Donato, Heinen just in the same draft, and Bjork was lost due to injury... Thats just in a single draft.

Then you can add Carlo, McAvoy on top of that, and a farm system loaded with more capable talent.
4014 2018-04-05 16:57:36 Once went through such period and the depression was real.. Happened after having done well in oil business for years then a major financial loss left us with nothing to manage..The shame held me for awhile but I shook it off and started freelancing in property sales & oda stuffs

4021 2018-04-05 16:57:05 This what could happen if you sneakily use Mrs. P's moisturizer as your aftershave. She's likely filled the bottle with some fiendishly hot pepper oil, and set it out for you as a cunning trap. 
4022 2018-04-05 16:57:05 I tried to mitigate by microwaving in a non frequented area of building! I'm only a heathen in search of a more fish oil in my diet!

4025 2018-04-05 16:56:53 The reason is the name "Trudeau". Most Albertans weren't around for the global oil glut of the early 80s, so "NEP" and "Trudeau" are easily adopted short-forms to cover their lack of knowledge. Mr. Kenney knows this.

4045 2018-04-05 16:55:46 yeah, but what about the fact that he’s human garbage who is systematically selling off the environment to big oil, coal, and mining industries, and rolling back progress that has been made on clean energy and climate change policy? what about that part, kim?
4046 2018-04-05 16:55:45 What scandal!  Those science guys who dare think Scott Pruitt is a paid shill for big oil. A Shell shill.

4048 2018-04-05 16:55:39 Are they serious? This government is absolutely deranged! They make it impossible to get an oil or gas project started, and then have the audacity to pay someone to find out why they can't get oil and gas projects started! It's like having children run the country! #cdnpoli

4059 2018-04-05 16:55:08 The reason is that there are far easier ways to make money in oil and gas than oil sands mega-projects, hence the move to tight oil. We will never compete with jurisdictions desperate for revenues at any cost.
4060 2018-04-05 16:55:06 @6of6s any news on the palm oil, my beagals? We hafnt been able to find an update
4061 2018-04-05 16:55:04 So misleading. How can you leave out the proliferation of oil and natural gas over the last 50 years? Why blame democrats, for a societies decision to want to live in cleaner environments.
4062 2018-04-05 16:54:58 You had 8 NHLers in 8 years under Chiarelli. You got 3 NHLers in 3 years with Gretz. I wouldn’t be excited about that.

4147 2018-04-05 16:47:45 It is also that "style transfer" can mean different things. Gatys' claim was to convert a photo into an artist's style, but of course his process was not doing that. Just copying some color and texture. Turning illustrations into oil paintings is perhaps closer to that goal?
4148 2018-04-05 16:47:44 Hell yeah!!
4149 2018-04-05 16:47:40 Farm commodities are like oil -- fungable. 

Now us farmers will simply sell to brokers in canada, who will sell to china, all on paper. Same ships, same routes. Big deal.

Yes water I conceded is a resource that we have in abundance, but water is not oil so the revenue raised would not be hugely significant.

4208 2018-04-05 16:43:19 Whether Harper did or didn't immaterial at this point. Fact is study was done. Don't need another. Fed policy is the problem. If I recall Cons were promoting oil and gas not finding ways to kill it.
4209 2018-04-05 16:43:09 Clay Rodgers, Ass. Executive Officer for water board says Valley Water agreed to Monitoring Reporting Program Wednesday, but staff still seeks board input on how to regulate such wastewater oil facilities in the future. This meeting and decision sets a stage for the future.
4210 2018-04-05 16:43:06 If cost of extraction is higher for unexplored oil deposits, and companies  can't produce without  a  profit, eventually wouldn't only higher priced oil will be in the market? In which case consumers would just choose not to consume oil and the supply would shut off on its own.
4211 2018-04-05 16:42:59 They will pay. The maffia of the seven sisters that control the oil market will be made to pay. ENOUGH!
4212 2018-04-05 16:42:57 Most Americans are irritated about their tax payers money being used in military campaigns to secure our control over the oil markets and keep our currency at decent value levels rather than investing that money in renewable energy, R&D and innovation.
4213 2018-04-05 16:42:57 I hadn't thought of that..the conservatives like him pretty much because he is slashing all govt regulations!  They like polluted water, oil spills, earthquakes caused by fracking & air pollution

4217 2018-04-05 16:42:43 It's definitely possible to do without egg yolk. I think I added the oil too much too quickly midway through
4218 2018-04-05 16:42:40 the 1% sets up the budget to keep you within your boundary, but if the 1% needs more money - they just make up words like subsidy or bail-out.  then people shrug and go welp geez, oil gas bank military need more money, better give it to them.

4222 2018-04-05 16:42:13 Is anyone investigating who benefits monetarily from the border wall, and not just the concrete and steel owners. I am willing to bet that oil/gas and mining have a stake in the border wall. With this admin racism is just a perk. Follow the money.
4223 2018-04-05 16:42:08 @BootsUK please ditch krill oil products @BootsUK, as a bricks and mortar operation you need a steady footfall through your stores what effect would a retail boycott have on your bottom line?

4248 2018-04-05 16:40:07 It must be true. The GOP has already repealed regulations, now allowing companies to pollute rivers and streams without penalty. They're rolling back environmental protections, destroying our national parks by opening them up to coal mining & oil drilling, and worse.
4249 2018-04-05 16:40:06 Yes but the his years there with Chiarelli are among the worst draft classes post lockout.

4475 2018-04-05 16:20:28 I use coconut oil when my hair is damaged from dying it and try to use as little heat on it as possible. If I don't have coconut oil I use like frizz ease stuff from herbal essence or morrocan oil :)
4476 2018-04-05 16:20:25 There is no way that people should "bank" on this Cuomo-IDC deal. The IDC will use a defeat in the Special Election as an excuse to bail. Or if they defeat their primary challengers they will reform like a bad oil spill. #legalChoiceMatters #NoIDCNY

4480 2018-04-05 16:19:54 Why having oil makes you rich, Norway vs Sweden
4481 2018-04-05 16:19:37 I understand that and agree.  But its the horrifying reality of oil spills in water and the impossibililty of cleaning it up before it damages many, many things ...from sea creatures to people's livelihoods.
4482 2018-04-05 16:19:36 Russians had the most to gain from liberals winning and killing our oil production and lng projects

4484 2018-04-05 16:19:22 I need some sweet oil to put in my ear 
4485 2018-04-05 16:19:18 The same with coal and oil.  If we take into consideration the environmental damage and the healthcare costs associated with coal and oil, they will always be more expensive than renewables.

4487 2018-04-05 16:19:08 Yes, while we pay more for gas, groceries and clothing just like his father created during his Reign of Error which cost taxpayer's dearly with ^interest rates, oil prices, and mortgage rates not to mention an increasingly large % of the population trying to survive imo!

4491 2018-04-05 16:18:57 Postal inspectors have guns too... So does the FDA and EPA.  But we should definitely give ours up.
4492 2018-04-05 16:18:55 We need to just repeal the Hughes amendment. If they're going to whine so much about us having military grade arms, we should be able to buy actual military grade arms.
4493 2018-04-05 16:18:51 I think that's right. There's a purported quote from Genscher about 25 years (but I've never found) that he dreamed of a world where Germany could pay for oil in a European currency. 1 thing is that shale means that the US doesn't really need energy exorbitant privilege anyway.
4494 2018-04-05 16:18:43 True Vegan - always trying to ram their view of the world down everyone else's throats. How about real fur being far more environmentally friendly than fake fur thats made from oil and won't degrade this side of the sun going supernova, that doesn't count I assume
4495 2018-04-05 16:18:38 Maduro's order that Vzla's Exports and Imports be paid with PETROS literally shuts down Vzla. NO country will sell anything to Vzla. to be paid with petros. Remember: Vzla. IMPORTS oil, naphta, alkylates, gasoline, diesel etc etc. Local prod. literally 0

4500 2018-04-05 16:18:22 Have you thought about the catch 22 China is caught? If they punish us too hard, they risk the bond market. I hear that the only way to trump Trump is to seriously devalue the Yuan.... And they are dropping dollar for oil purchases... It's going to be interesting!
4501 2018-04-05 16:18:10 Some olive oil for the perfect final touch!
4502 2018-04-05 16:17:56 I can't use anything except olive oil or else my face will freak out. It's not fancy, but I think its great.

4509 2018-04-05 16:17:32 So Vlad and Spanky sat hand in hand on the edge of the dock dreaming of  the money they'll reap from the Iran oil fields.  "First we'll have to rebuild the refineries we bombed" Said Vlad. "No bid contracts, right?" said Spanky. "But of course!" laughed Vlad.

4568 2018-04-05 16:12:57 It's only in Nigeria that a government is judged based on the number of roads commissioned. PDP ruled for 16 years, how many roads did they complete, they didn't only abandoned all the projects they started, they were owing contractors billions even when crude oil was above $100.
4569 2018-04-05 16:12:53 I think we chose to not have revenue stability.Oil is not the only means of revenue known to Nigeria ,as a matter of fact we jettisoned other alternative means and focused solely on oil. If we had diversified/had maintained all the other sources in addition to oil, we'll be fine

4661 2018-04-05 16:07:06 Yes, multinationals are often involved in extracting oil. Aramco different. Federalism in Iraq (Kurd example), but no U.S. "control" of resources.
4662 2018-04-05 16:07:05 Petroleum is then refined into various fuels such as gasoline, diesel oil, kerosene, and HFO, which is the heaviest part, with a high boiling point and high viscosity, almost tar-like.

4678 2018-04-05 16:06:25 Hi Lindsey, the certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)
4679 2018-04-05 16:06:24 FYI - using TAR sands to describe heavy oil is not an insult. You trying to explain how you are going to heat your home or drive your car by burning wood instead of oil and gas would be interesting.

4699 2018-04-05 16:05:09 There is no law that could be enacted bcos we do not have revenue stability. Our oil prices can not be predicted. So it is only persuasion that a new govt will be compelled to complete d abandoned projects

4718 2018-04-05 16:03:49 Hi @rvkgrapevine, the terminology is not quite correct, the proposal is to ban Heavy Fuel, also called Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), or "svartolía" in Icelandic. 'Petroleum' is not the same but broader term, in Icelandic 'hráolía', which is the unrefined stuff straight from the ground.

4855 2018-04-05 15:54:38 This seems to be a common theme of entitlement and convenient ignorance. "I get to chose whether or not my tax dollars go to something for other people. But you don't get to chose where yours go."

I don't want mine going to bombing other countries or oil company subsidies.
4856 2018-04-05 15:54:37 catch me buying the wake&bake oil, cake mix foundation, AND the beauty egg sponges (i forget the name but I know it’s egg smth lmao) from @beautybakerie next paycheck  I dipped my toe in with that brownie gel now I’m gonna go all in

4860 2018-04-05 15:54:12 Put tanning oil on my arms  fuck me im literally frying 
4861 2018-04-05 15:54:10 Dinner should be mostly lean protein cooked in healthy fats (olive oil, avocado oil etc) with steamed veggies or a salad with dark greens and a low fat low cal dressing like oil and vinegar. Carbs should be the smallest part of the meal

4863 2018-04-05 15:53:59 Oil Licence not renewable says President Buhari.  Now you all know why dey don't want him
4864 2018-04-05 15:53:54 They never wonder why a huge NO campaign was launched by west minister to keep us part of their rule if we were spongers they would’ve happily gave us independence without a vote!
Still Scots can’t see they’re pillaging our country oil,water,seafood, all and any resources! #YES
4865 2018-04-05 15:53:48 I wonder why US loves to send troops when a country has oil with the excuse that they are going to aid people. Why US won't sent troops to these countries and really help them to disappear those gangs. I don't understand.

4867 2018-04-05 15:53:43 I reckon I’ve tried them all at one time or another, probably trichomania or Godiva are my favourites overall  want to try out the one with argan oil next 
4868 2018-04-05 15:53:38 I can understand if your in an area where there is a danger to you, your family or livestock but that’s really it. Not really a problem with wildlife in LA or NYC
4869 2018-04-05 15:53:25 I agree with you, and have heard that India & Japan have at times bought oil in EUR in recent years (fr Iran).  This creates massive incipient funding pressures on US gov't that will ultimately have to be addressed via a much lower USD.
4870 2018-04-05 15:53:25 Which oil pakodawalas  using? they should take care of health of their customers and should use ricebran oil or peanut oil for frying they should mention it so they will get more customers
4871 2018-04-05 15:53:23 When GEJ don spend money finish nkooo. Also crude oil market dropped drastically in his first year.

4874 2018-04-05 15:53:14 @AliVelshi @SRuhle The most important issue with Pruitt of the Environmental POISON Agcy is what he's doing for the lobbyists and his cronies.He is reversing or has already reversed  all environmental safeguards against air,oil and water pollution. THAT is why he should be fired!

4883 2018-04-05 15:52:56 Rather have a pipeline than a train. Look up that town in Quebec that burned to the ground when a train derailed carrying oil. With loss of lives.

4895 2018-04-05 15:51:58 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic as a Boots customer I'm asking you to stop selling krill oil products. Please don't put the oceans and wildlife in danger any longer
4896 2018-04-05 15:51:47 No because apparently the guy with the gun had done time in jail, and it’s legal there for him to be armed. Hear if you break and law other than traffic you’re never have a licence. Also your only allowed 50 rounds. Guns are too easy to get over there and most aren’t needed

4900 2018-04-05 15:51:43 Dear Noam Chomsky,
Life goes on like someone made a pumpkin pie
out of motor oil & hair clumps.
It feels like a cramp when I tell the truth.
I lie here afraid of lying here. There's a voice
inside my pillow. Is this normal? 
Today I'll pack up my face & take it across the border.
4901 2018-04-05 15:51:41 Funny nobody ever brought up primary against FDR.  Why?  Because FDR represented THE PEOPLE!  He didn’t represent the banksters, oil companies, health insurance companies, big Rx, etc.
4902 2018-04-05 15:51:40 Arugula, feta cheese and olive oil (shrimp or scallops go great with this also if possible!!)
4903 2018-04-05 15:51:29 Yeah, cutting heating oil for the poor made people fall in love with him. Or was it running out of bombs to drop?

4957 2018-04-05 15:47:43 Let me give the study result. We can only sell oil to the US, or we have to address issues of human right, environment, gender quality, democracy, the labor protection standard, and women rights of potential destination countries.

4963 2018-04-05 15:47:24 I get that this an accident, but if someone ever shot my daughter, they surely wouldn't want "restorative justice".  They'd want to be in jail, for their own safety.

Respected Sir,  please look into Oil prices rise it hits day today life. Due to recession it is difficult to manage.
5110 2018-04-05 15:38:36 Prove how ethano destroys your engine. Ethanol has been around for years and no record of it destroying engines. Least people are not being killed over ethanol, but you just keep on supporting your wars over oil.
5111 2018-04-05 15:38:35 I am disappointed to hear that @BootsUK is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. #ProtectAntarctic
5112 2018-04-05 15:38:29 Yeah you need to do a no wash week and use dry shampoo then switch to washing 1-3 times a week (I do 2) and your hair will be much better on producing less oil
5113 2018-04-05 15:38:25 Priorities. 

Greenwald, who leads the endangered species project at the Center for Biological Diversity, said easing or removing the protections could help oil and agriculture companies who currently must avoid killing or harming the habitat of these at-risk species.

5125 2018-04-05 15:37:57 A threat to boycott works well but not a blanket boycott like palm oil free labelling. Companies will react faster to a dog barking inside their office than a dog barking outside their office.

5174 2018-04-05 15:35:10 Data is the new oil...in the way that oil is a ubiquitous commodity that requires incredible resource allocation to extract value from, deep expertise to manage – and even when all that goes well – can have universally consequential negative externalities.
5175 2018-04-05 15:35:09 so @jackieaina said the wake&bake oil from @beautybakerie makes the cake mix foundation way easier to blend so I guess I’ll be getting that too! plus a waterproof formula is gonna be soo nice this summer, my skin isn’t oily anymore but damn I sweat TOO MUCH lmao

5241 2018-04-05 15:31:04 I haven’t tried this oil from @DECLEORSkincare  however, I would like to try it. Thank you for the chance.

5243 2018-04-05 15:30:56 Even though I waited until the last minute, I still got an oil change and my taxes done all before 10:30 in the morning. + a three mile walk in.

5256 2018-04-05 15:30:30 I'd be surprised if Russian state did this. Someone else was behind it, maybe Russian but not government. Too obvious and Putin just wants to sell his oil & gas.

5289 2018-04-05 15:27:53 Just in case anyone was wondering, Mary Fallin's campaign contributions from oil and gas total $365,469.95. And we wonder why tax cuts for oil companies are easily approved, but we still haven't gotten a goddamn raise for our teachers in 10 years.
5290 2018-04-05 15:27:52 red wings are goodyear welted, should last a lifetime with a little boot oil and occasional resoling.  love my iron rangers!

5300 2018-04-05 15:27:23 Some counties also depend solely on Agriculture before emergence of crude oil , where are they now, they are far developed compared to my dear sleeping giant Nigeria. Cursed the day the past leaders were born not crude oil.

5327 2018-04-05 15:25:26 Follow the money!$$$This would give big oil and big ag carte blanche to destroy creatures that are currently vulnerable and on the threatened species list. GOP had never been a friend to the environment. They discussed me all.

5334 2018-04-05 15:25:00 Very disappointed with Boots in UK which needs to help protect whales, penguins in seals from krill oil products. There's only one Antarctic and when we've killed off the vulnerable wildlife there's no going back. Do the right thing #ProtectAntarctic
5335 2018-04-05 15:25:00 The biggest problem with sustainable palm oil is the low demand for it. You can have an anti palm oil petition with a million names on it but it's a fraction of the total consumer market. The manufacturers know this and use it as a reason to avoid their ethical obligation

5341 2018-04-05 15:24:37 @BootsUK why haven't you yet followed the other retailers and dropped krill oil products that are sourced from sensitive Antarctic waters? @holland_barrett and @superdrug have.

5375 2018-04-05 15:22:54 (Reuters) - #Saudi Arabia’s shipping group Bahri said on Thursday that one of its vessels, oil tanker Abqaiq, was targeted on April 3 in international waters south west of the port of #Hodeidah in #Yemen.
5376 2018-04-05 15:22:50 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic I am disappointed to hear that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. Please consider the welfare of these precious areas of our planet & make a change - stop stocking krill products now!
5377 2018-04-05 15:22:48 Absolutely. Especially in context of the main stream and cable content providers, advertisers seem to hold the most power. Information (and people) can indeed be silenced by advertisers. Why else would big oil have ads? i.e. Nobody on MSNBC talks about climate change seriously.

5419 2018-04-05 15:20:05 Instead of ensuring that the benefits of low global oil prices reach people, the Modi Govt is burning holes in their pockets by raising taxes on fuel. Another Jumla exposed, as people get #PeTrolled

5490 2018-04-05 15:15:39 Congratulations Dr. Gustavo Petro, your arguments are  absolutely smart and coherent.  Your position about Colombia's productivity staying away of oil is key  in the current Climate change  reality and the world's new economies  based  on removable technologies. You rocked it! :)

5492 2018-04-05 15:15:26 The Republicans refuse to even come up to 7% taxation of the oil & gas. Oklahoma has the lowest Gross Production Tax on oil & gas in the United States!

5495 2018-04-05 15:15:14 Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, warming the climate about 80x more than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. 

And oil and gas operations are the largest single industrial source of methane emissions in the United States.   Vote @PhilBredesen

5497 2018-04-05 15:15:08 We really need to move on past oil. So many other energies are available with our new technology. Oil is dirty, old. We need clean efficient energy. Electric cars that charge in the sun. Magnet powered trains. We can do it if they would stop paying people to stay quiet.

5513 2018-04-05 15:14:05 Yes and the whiny oil companies who fought tooth and nail to stop their taxes from being raised to a level that is still the lowest in the nation are just totally reasonable. Not like those spoiled teachers who want unbroken desk chairs that don't hurt their kids.

5625 2018-04-05 15:07:50 It really depends on your hair type, most black people need to add oil because it’s not good for it to be dry, but other types don’t really need to add oil, which is why they have to wash it every other day due to it accumulating so much oil in so little time

5659 2018-04-05 15:06:18 Norwegian lessons for the UK - how about spending the last 50 years taxing oil and gas extraction. Then you can have a Sovereign Wealth Fund of $1 trillion.

Whereas the UK as a country has nothing. But the 1% have $31 trillion deposited in tax havens.

5734 2018-04-05 15:02:40 You realize only Congress can appropriate funds! Yes, a couple of companies went under after receiving subsidies but many were successful. We also subsidize big oil with $37.5 BILLION/ year yet they are one of the most profitable industries in US. You think that is OK?

The janky smell at my Slaughter/ MoPac dig site is likely not an unearthed burial plot.

Per TxDOT “Culprit is possibly associated with some soil the contractor is removing that may have been contaminated by an old oil spill”

5920 2018-04-05 14:49:14 Leave aside snake oil vs. magic debate: Cambridge Analytica's role in Trump campaign was modest but destructive and the tech was scaled just right for his electoral strategy: get 1% more voters, and suppress 1% of opponent's voters, in a handful of states.

5930 2018-04-05 14:48:13 There is no reason also, given the geopolitical reality, battery operated cars and offcourse diminishing oil reserves and there's a small matter of being use to living in luxury he won't relish tents now
5931 2018-04-05 14:48:13 FUN FACT : If Australia's remaining refineries stopped work right now and oil/fuel imports stopped immediately, there would be less than 3 weeks worth of fuel left for the public. 3 days if the defense force started rolling.

5965 2018-04-05 14:45:00 Well, we our wealthiest folks decided they would rather protect their international interests in the Middle East (I.E. Opiates, Oil etc) and instead of spending their money on the protection, they goosed the American Tax Payer into footing the bill.

5976 2018-04-05 14:44:08 Sellers mkt.  Refuse to buy US oil, means they buy from someone else.  US then sells to their former buyer. Unless OPEC+ increases prod, to steal mkt share, but this would run counter to their macro goal of supply constriction. As well, higher fuel costs hurts CN more than US.

5993 2018-04-05 14:42:52 None of this is a 'great observation', this has been true for years. We sell them weapons, buy their oil, seem desperate for the @Saudi_Aramco listing, which will possibly never happen, and let our leaders dance with their swords. Now he's in town doesn't become "new".

5998 2018-04-05 14:42:36 I use a homemade himalayan salt scrub. Tea tree oil, rose oil, and witch hazel works great as well. Also, not washing my face every day but every few days because it was drying my face out and causing me to break out even more. If you have acne scaring, lavender oil is great too.

 Matthew 25:10 New International Version (NIV)
 10 “But  while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived.  The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
6000 2018-04-05 14:42:31 I remember a year ago or so, I saw this picture of a woman with oil all over her body, and the caption said "Is this oil or white paint to represent oil." I always think it's white paint now.
6001 2018-04-05 14:42:26 Went and got my Oil changed this morning and the assistant manager is from oregon and he just moved her a few months ago and we both conversed on how The West Coast IS IN FACT The best Coast!

6003 2018-04-05 14:42:11 Matthew 25:9 New International Version (NIV)

6014 2018-04-05 14:41:18 The US and Turkey are working together. Their deal seems to be Turkey gets everything west of Euphrates as long as the US controls everything to the east of it where Syria's oil and gas fields are.

6023 2018-04-05 14:40:33 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
6024 2018-04-05 14:40:32 That’s Propaganda. If you knew anything about economics you would have know that oil amounts to about 90% of Venezuela exports, and oil prices has fallen by more than half thus their racking in only half as much........their economic crisis is due to low oil prices not socialism

6039 2018-04-05 14:39:47 Energy companies made more in profits than any other industry in the history of the world. Those greedy companies still get tax subsidies to produce oil. They need to reinvest to make their product safer for the environment.  Theyve known about climate chasnge since the 1970s.

6055 2018-04-05 14:38:59 there was no human error on the part of state-owned energy giant Pertamina in the recent oil spill incident in Balikpapan, as the event was triggered by the action of a foreign coal vessel that illegally passed through and dropped anchor in the bay.

6275 2018-04-05 14:19:10 This is a result of big industry manipulating the narrative in the media.

6282 2018-04-05 14:18:31 MBuhari has also ordered a stop in pumping crude oil for loading terminals and to our refineries at night. Now pumping starts at 0600 and stops at 1800. Hence, no way to steal and siphon by the power mongers. This is why they are after the God-sent President.

6324 2018-04-05 14:14:19 coconut oil is shitty for most hair types.. you need to check how your hair strand behaves on water - and with that you can choose a suitable oil. also you don’t use oil alone, there a few ways for that and it really works magic for your hair!
6325 2018-04-05 14:14:19 Tried MCT oil for the first time this morning. Not sure if I feel more alert but I'm definitely full and have zero cravings. I fast so I would've started feeling hungry by now.

6350 2018-04-05 14:12:12 They pretty much are. As is google and FB. Standard Oil had 64% market share when broken up. Google has ~70% search share and G+FB >60% ad share. Plus they have become the literal gatekeepers of information. This gives them extraordinary power to manipulate and be anticompetitive

6354 2018-04-05 14:11:48 It's a little more complicated than you know. It's a shell game with revenue streams, giving money to Universities that have multi-million dollar coaches salaries, and pandering to oil and gas, among other issues.
6355 2018-04-05 14:11:43 We are changing the size of our oil bottles from 50mL to 40mL.

6375 2018-04-05 14:10:42 Oil money can win you the Premier League, League Cup, it may even win them the UCL, but it can't buy you a coach with beer can/bottle proof glass to keep your players safe! Not condoning actions of some LFC fans by the way.

6383 2018-04-05 14:10:11 It's become blatantly obvious why estrogen dominance is a problem in our society as I've tried to find soy free products. Soybean oil had monopolized the food industry. Now I see why officials blasted coconut & palm oil as bad. It was to push the soybean industry.

6646 2018-04-05 13:51:13 My dads mom, Elvia would feed us beans mixed with oil and my other “special” cousin the meat. I will never forget the day she put kerosene in my hair, it itched so bad.

6649 2018-04-05 13:51:03 He is the swamp. By deregulation you mean enriching big oil and other polluters at the expense of the people. You really are a disgusting individual. How much were you paid to write this?
6650 2018-04-05 13:51:02 Sounds like an episode of Dallas. Just exchange the buildings for oil fields and the story reads like a Hollywood script.
6651 2018-04-05 13:50:40 What level of ignorance is this? What do we benefit from Nigeria? With all the oil money. Small Finland offers free education. I guess their schools are not up to starndard. Ódè!

6669 2018-04-05 13:48:51 The rest of us are doing it, and yes our governments suck, and now they are giving our oil and natural resources to American and Israel companies, our waters and food are poisoned and if people protest these companies hire mercenaries to kill them, they just disappear people

6700 2018-04-05 13:46:37 Long oil - 5 ticks of heat. Smashed it. Daily bias looking for a big target. Get scared out. 3 seconds later we're up 60 ticks. Somebody punch me in the head.
6701 2018-04-05 13:46:34 Help the oceans restock, stop using Krill oil , why are you still profiting from a fishing industry which is threatening the health of Antarctic wildlife like penguins, seals and whales?

6703 2018-04-05 13:46:18 I have noticed on a recent visit to one of your stores that you are still selling Krill Oil products. I have found this rather disappointing as other companies have stopped stocking these products in order to protect our Oceans and the natural habitat.

6710 2018-04-05 13:45:55 Ben parceque, en majorité ce sont des entreprises ou des pme, qui utilisent ces véhicules. Et je crois qu il existé la défilcalisation du gaz oil pour les entreprises. Donc en majorité, les constructeur automobile ont favorisés les utilitaires diesel.

6760 2018-04-05 13:42:48 But more and more of Big Oil are now sued and most courts denies their lawsuits.
6761 2018-04-05 13:42:48 @POTUS our ex president, unlike President Nixon who was not a crook, states he tries to avoid taxes so the money 'does go to Donald Trump' which gives us all a view of how stupid he is and should like Marc Rich go to Her Majesty's Pleasure. And signs a last minute deal for oil.

6894 2018-04-05 13:30:55 100% they will. As far as the buyout goes, I don't view it as a savings at any point b/c they need to go find a replacement who had better be an improvement & at less of a hit...not easy. IMO to extend it long term is in insanity, especially w/ one already on the books.

6906 2018-04-05 13:30:10 Saudi Arabia is essencially jizzing oil all over the US while at the same time fingering human rights. I see nothig wrong with that.
6907 2018-04-05 13:30:09 The BP oil rig explosion and subsequent oil spill were in 2010, but still have an impact today. Business owners may be entitled to damages.

6913 2018-04-05 13:29:14 Definitely agree re: palm oil.  I couldn’t find a vegan marg / butter that didn’t have it (plus usually lots of other rubbish too). Hence the DIY approach. Same with peanut butter (although there are some palm oil free options around).

6925 2018-04-05 13:28:17 The oil bonds with the toxins in your mouth, so when you spit the oil out you’re also spitting the toxins out.

6947 2018-04-05 13:26:40 Forget about steel, oil fracking in America is dictating the price of crude oil in Africa and other oil producing nations. Although it very expensive and not good to the environment, still they have to do it.

7037 2018-04-05 13:20:17 May arrogantly dismisses Putins attempt to pour oil on these troubled waters. and even steps up the pressure, without one shred of evidence that he was behind the poisoning. it was more likely to have been a 3rd party determined to embarrass Putin and stoke the fires of unrest.

7092 2018-04-05 13:17:17 I don't doubt that. Just that if it was in school syllabuses by the early '90s, then it must have been common knowledge by then. I guess the issue is with whom does the responsibility lie. The policy makers? The oil companies? The end-users?

I wager the guys best placed to make that switch right now is the oil industry, especially the downstream retailers.

7154 2018-04-05 13:13:57 Answer is - lack of pipeline space therefore causing high discount for CDN oil and high regulatory uncertainty.

7188 2018-04-05 13:11:57 Agree. Seems aerial war has turned into “boots on the ground” invasion in some people’s minds. I don’t think Trump @POTUS  is so stupid as to invade Syria (holding breath as I type) because there’s no win in it eg oil, influence or oneupmanship.

7278 2018-04-05 13:06:10 It’s like how Spain produces something like 60% of all of the world’s consumed Olive Oil... you remember the 00’s don’t you? Which has crushed traditional economies across Southern Europe and the Middle East...

7287 2018-04-05 13:05:30 Trump,like Obama,is right to worry about mission creep in Syria.The American-led coalition,has recently bombed Syrian forces, backed by Iran & Russia,whose advancing on oil fields held by Syrian Forces,a mostly Arab faction that's fighting the U.S. against Islamic State,ISIS.

7300 2018-04-05 13:04:29 I use coconut oil to wash makeup off my face, with no clogged pores or anything but I'd deff be careful with it bc a lot of people have probs with it. I usually use a vitamin c oil when I get out of the shower. And when my skin is extra cranky I use a TON of aquaphor at night
7301 2018-04-05 13:04:26 I think the point is that many oil companies dissembled on the science, in their public pronouncements, whereas privately they were well aware of the evidence – indeed, in some cases, they had been at the forefront of assembling it.

7315 2018-04-05 13:03:28 but using oils by itself can dry your skin out. the only way to use it is to mix it with a moisturiser or for massage/removing black heads 
olive oil seems way too heavy to even put on your face.. maybe on hair for some hair types

7334 2018-04-05 13:01:44 Yeah.. but like Olive Oil is more like the thing used in europe?? Or growing in europe etc, so it's not too aggressive. It just has to do with where we come from haha from which climate. That shouldn't be a daily thing also but it can work!!

7386 2018-04-05 12:56:05 “The thicker the oil the better” is utter nonsense. Oil, like nearly everything in our universe, has an optimal range. Your car maker will recommend the correct range (30 weight, 40 weight, etc.). Too thick & it doesn’t perform correctly.

7406 2018-04-05 12:53:23 Yeah @Total put a lot of CCS advertisements in my timeline as well. The big oil companies @Shell @Statoil seem to agree on #CCS #CCUS need. Unsurprisingly.. Why haven't they implemented it in any large scale yet. Mixed feelings? Uncertainty? Too expensive?
7407 2018-04-05 12:53:19 Very poor countries got rich. Not so hard especially for an oil producer in a boom. Well done for staying there though. The explanations are needed for Greece and Portugal staying poor. Their potential for catch up is good.

7414 2018-04-05 12:52:43 That's no answer is it? Wales is the poorest part of the UK. It doesn't even have oil. How is it going to raise sufficient funds to even stay at the same level of debt you have referred to?
7415 2018-04-05 12:52:36 Of course we know. Tax the rich. This whole problem is because the Homa Road its trickle-down economy never text me to oil wealth and it kept on riding it right down into the sewer until nobody in their right mind would want to live in that state.

7453 2018-04-05 12:48:16 Sure. It is a more targeted approach for anti-Capitalist radicals to attempt to stop our economy if they “go after the supply”. This means we may have a burgeoning terror style movement to damage oil wells etc. very very dangerous. Still will hurt the poor when fuel costs rise

7489 2018-04-05 12:44:04 To be honest I'd find it useful to have a 1.5°C scenario. Our organization is using the SDS more and more in its comms btw. Even in most ambitious scenarios oil & gas still needed for many things in the end, even though their share could very well drop.

7492 2018-04-05 12:42:51 For me the only thing left to fully conclude is that we don’t have a counterfactual of how GEJ would have reacted to an oil price crash. I have a feeling I know but because it didn’t happen, the assessment won’t ever be complete.
7493 2018-04-05 12:42:51 same here, i pay to get mine done w/ a higher grade oil...but jiffy lube does more than just change the oil...which has its benefits. So she's ignorant.

And then there's places which use peanut oil on their fries.
7504 2018-04-05 12:41:46 Following up, actually, increasing oil production traps Russia into a series of policies (I'm totally for renewables). But the larger point is that we need to stop talking about Russia in MENA as a great power play/just about the west. It's also about Asia and Moscow's stuck.
7505 2018-04-05 12:41:35 Serious question - do they actually and literally anoint the M.Div. graduates with oil? If not, then they are not the anointed, no matter how loudly they bleat that they are. Biblical fidelity and all that...

7546 2018-04-05 12:37:08 Philosophical paradigm shifts can be done in a diverse country, but, it's like steering a fully loaded oil tanker 180 degrees, it's slow and takes time. A series of small victories with a demonstrable route to success to build on would be persuasive.

7556 2018-04-05 12:36:25 “The government is spending more on infrastructure than previous administrations, despite earning barely half of what the country earned from oil between 2011 and 2014 when the product was selling for an average of $110 per barrel." ~ Garba Shehu, SSA(Media and Publicity)

7590 2018-04-05 12:32:35 We should pay this carbon tax to companies working on technologies to free the people from high cost of energy bills and demand the government to back them. After all we didn't make millions and billions on sale of oil. We also didn't hold back on technology to keep profits high

7599 2018-04-05 12:32:02 The appeal of hummus is that chickpeas have a great flavor, which can be used to complement a great many savory things. Hummus can be augmented by toppings, like zaatar, olive oil, or ful. The idea of flavored hummus misses the entire underlying idea of hummus.

7659 2018-04-05 12:26:02 I change my own oil and you don’t save that much money.. That synthetic oil isn’t cheap. I’ve also paid to have it done wonder what she thinks about that
7660 2018-04-05 12:25:38 Not sure if these scientists are aware, but global warming isn't just about the earth being warmer. It's also about the co2 in our air, which is dissolved into our oceans. This makes the oceans more acidic and jeopardizes marine life. How about we just burn less coal/oil?

7672 2018-04-05 12:24:59 Great idea. Start with the coastal cities since they have a breeze to keep them cool and millions of illegals to keep them warm. Just how much electricity do illegal aliens use?  Could we disable s few coal fired plants if the illegals were gone?

7678 2018-04-05 12:24:23 The act of oil money distributed to host communities should also be stopped. Investment in social amenities in these places should be encouraged.

7683 2018-04-05 12:23:12 Tell @BootsUK to stop profiting from a fishing industry which is sucking up huge amounts of krill, from right in front of the whales and penguins that need it. RT to #ProtectAntarctic and stop Boots from selling krill oil.
7684 2018-04-05 12:22:59 They will need the new Pointe Noire port too similar to #ZIOC who are years advanced of #KP2. IMF in town currently and looking to diversify from oil - Iron ore and Potash gonna boom!
7685 2018-04-05 12:22:47 Investment has doubled from the PDP days despite when the price of 1barrel of oil was higher.. the price of naira has also almost doubled in that period so it actually works out to be roughly the same..

Ignorance is bliss! This is beginning of the fall of American Democracy #VOTE2018

7690 2018-04-05 12:21:51 The power went out. Been out since last night. Broke out the oil lamp and candles, built a nice fire in the fireplace. It's nice. Quiet. All you hear is the raging windstorm outside.

7693 2018-04-05 12:21:31 It was about oil in the East Indies. They had no desire or will to invade the American mainland for your stated reasons.
7694 2018-04-05 12:21:12 In other words I think it's moral to artificially increase the cost of oil and coal

7706 2018-04-05 12:20:14 I see only Congress-ruled states are opposing. So, its just a political game for @IncIndia and nothing else. If Modi/BJP didn't pay off huge debts related to Oil and OMC's, the economy would have collapsed by now. ,

7713 2018-04-05 12:19:47 Yh you're quite right but I don't think oil companies will fail without subsidies though, however, I've already voiced my opposition to it. I think subsidies for green energy are probably a good thing but I've already voiced my ultimate preference

7725 2018-04-05 12:18:52 I love my new tool, the Bosch random orbit sander GEX 125-1 AE. Sanding my chestnut table was a breeze and the filter kept almost all of the dust from spreading to the apartment. Too bad I managed to drop oil can on the surface for a brand new mark... work for a later year :)

7729 2018-04-05 12:18:29 Trump just green lit the gas guzzler industry.  Drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas is part of the game plan to foul the Earth.
7730 2018-04-05 12:18:24 So @Nissan sent me a thank you for using their body shop: A free oil change for my vehicle! Only problem? Its a Leaf. @NissanElectric can you help your colleagues out?
7731 2018-04-05 12:18:20 @smileyradioshow Mozzi's in Greenfield also has BLT pizza but they use an olive oil in place of sauce. They also have a fajita pizza. Many different ones, they have a website!
7732 2018-04-05 12:18:20 Call me a mid-level manager who has found MBTI useful but also recognizes there are many reasons to think it's pure snake oil.

7733 2018-04-05 12:18:19 According to the CNREM, Ghana was supposed to get $11bn from the oil and gas sector between 2010-2017 but only $4bn has been realized so far.
7734 2018-04-05 12:18:14 We can strive to rid the world of greedy countries and their leaders. Those who take advantage of the weak and poor. Thsoe who use religion as an excuse of being evil and backwards, to free people and take their wealth and oil. All the while killing men, raping women and children
7735 2018-04-05 12:18:02 INDCs as per Paris Agreement India has To reduce carbon emission intensity of the GDP by (32 - 35%) or (1/3rd) from 2005 levels.
so, Despite fall of international prices for crude oil, India has kept high excise duty and thus reduced the possible increase in carbon emissions
7736 2018-04-05 12:17:57 lrt: i would say 'it really be like that tho' but I AM A MAN and I don't run. I take oil splatters as the blood-price for tasty fried food

7739 2018-04-05 12:17:42 Came for an oil change and of course other stuff needed to be done....
7740 2018-04-05 12:17:41 I thought this was about @kurteichenwald
7741 2018-04-05 12:17:41 I probably should go and get an oil change and get my plates right.
7742 2018-04-05 12:17:38 Can’t we charge the same price for wheat as they do oil?
7743 2018-04-05 12:17:37 Forget GST. How many states are breathing on fuel taxes? How crucial is centre's revenue from fuel? 

It's known that a large chunk of money/ Forex is drained on oil. Who else rips off centre in refining crude? Will centre name refiners contracts?
7744 2018-04-05 12:17:32 When you Saudi’s run out of oil - America will turn you into the next Iraq. I would be careful about how you treat Israelites.

7762 2018-04-05 12:15:36 Americans are chronically deficient in vitamin D. Neural tube defects are still a problem.
Multivitamins raise IQ and test scores in children. Fish oil reduces anxiety and craving in recovering addicts.
There are plenty of examples where supplements are useful
7763 2018-04-05 12:15:29 It’s the BASE, silly-so called knows he is losing BIGLY his pitiful base as they are seeing he is just another lecherous snake oil man playing with a golden bankrupted egg: diversion today-border, tomorrow

7765 2018-04-05 12:15:06 I only told one person on Twitter.
7766 2018-04-05 12:14:54 Bill, Faux news has all the answers for your questions. They are serving as the president and the trumpeter is simply hawking more snake oil based on what his daily Faux brief is saying on F & F.

7770 2018-04-05 12:14:40 Also healthy fats make you fuller and feel like you’re eating. I love almonds, walnuts, yoghurt, olive oil, avocado and even butter! 
I’ll eat a fatty yoghurt with honey, berries and walnuts for a yummy snack.
7771 2018-04-05 12:14:38 Why you then send the 3rd world and pathological cultures to the west (The Mafia loves it $$$) ? This will not save any problem. Not the population issue nor the war/oil issue. I think you guys need to throw away your suits, retire and start planting potatoes.

7777 2018-04-05 12:14:10 Ha Ha! Was that Oil Lamp feature originally scheduled for April 1st?
No working Oil lamp has ever been made with the burner UNDER the font! A certain recipe for an expolosive time.
If not made by you then was constructed by someone with a sense of humour...
7778 2018-04-05 12:14:09 Great POTUS is going to bankrupt his enemy Putin. All they got to export is vodka and oil.  POTUS has expanded US oil production and will sell into Putin's oil markets. Obama still loves Castro, Gore, Maduro, mao, all commie comrades. You share the wealth

7794 2018-04-05 12:11:31 Why are you not seeing the fact that Oil Marketing companies were under huge debt in 2014, India had to pay Iran and also bring back OMC's. After deregulation and many actions from Modi, they are coming back to life. So, see the facts before parroting #Pappu's word
7795 2018-04-05 12:11:30 can we use oil like water.... Free of charge.... in this case...
7796 2018-04-05 12:11:20 I've never given a unaffected bottle of oil about photorealism.
7797 2018-04-05 12:11:03 Otherwise, the oil can be on the sides, as scaling the pyramid would make it even tougher.
Additionally, you could have the entrance do a lot of snaking and twisting, making true entrance a hidden secret as everyone are blind folded and led in differently.
7798 2018-04-05 12:10:38 Yes, Oil prices are High now but Congress claimed During their rule, Prices were too low and Now there's huge gap.

1st April 2014:
Delhi: 72.26
Kolkata: 80.13
Mumbai: 80.89
Chennai: 75.49

1st April 2018:
Delhi: 73.73
Kolkata: 76.44
Mumbai: 81.59
Chennai: 76.48

What's Huge Gap?
7799 2018-04-05 12:10:36 No I don’t think that 80billion will be the amount that is technically recoverable, if Libya is anything to go by, 104bln barrels of shale oil nets an estimated 5bln barrel haul
7800 2018-04-05 12:10:35 La actual pelea comercial entre China y Estados Unidos ha arrastrado también el mercado petrolero. En una guerra comercial, ambos países sufrirían, lo cual afectaría el consumo de las dos economías que generan más demanda de crudo. #oil #petróleo #China #bolsa

7803 2018-04-05 12:10:18 Depends, we're likely to be needed for every qualifier, and I quite like the journey we go on to reach the groups, but invariably we draw ridiculous teams which shows us up more and more each year as clubs throw around their oil money.

7817 2018-04-05 12:08:44 Just roll back tax levels to last year Henry was in office. Economy has recovered, oil prices have somewhat recovered.

7824 2018-04-05 12:07:56 Lower supply == higher prices == lower demand.   So do a voxsplainer article on how this isn't simply doing what you said you didn't want to do.  Also explain why allowing oil company profits to remain high via higher prices at a cost to consumers is consistent with your beliefs.
7825 2018-04-05 12:07:55 Actually, getting people to pay a few cronies that control oil is a much more efficient way to fleece people. Renewable energy is saving me money every year.
7826 2018-04-05 12:07:42 Gue biasa pake olive oil wardah setiap sebelum tidur. Terlihat ... lumayan.
7827 2018-04-05 12:07:36 lol no bailouts are bad too. But yes the oil companies getting subsidies artificially increases the cost of green energy.

7841 2018-04-05 12:05:26 I think you're talking about gov't bailouts not subsidies. Is your point that oil or coal companies getting subsidies unfairly reduces their sales price hence making green energy less attractive?

7958 2018-04-05 11:46:52 Yes of course!US always held the shortsighted corrupt Arab leaders to ransom,playing on their own selfish fears & stoking up religious divisions, to destabilise region’s security,for Israel by milking away their oil revenues,not caring about the Arab masses welfare & aspirations!
7959 2018-04-05 11:46:51 I wish you know how oil prices are regulated. ..It is very easy to point finger at govt...
7960 2018-04-05 11:46:34 But during congress time oil prices reach at 110 , & now it is just 80.
Just wait & watch.

4. Get a sonic anti pest plug in (does work)

8086 2018-04-05 11:28:23 I hope you know why there was a BOP crisis in 1990s. , gulf war, spiraling oil prices? I look at big picture, this Govt showed clear intent to deregulate oil prices, make decisive move towards electric mobility and renewable energy. UPA was incapable to even deregulate prices.

8089 2018-04-05 11:28:10 Yes! It's so versatile. It works in sauces, on veggies... Roast it for a few minutes, then add to olive oil for a great dipping sauce.

8263 2018-04-05 10:57:34 Lavender oil is used to treat various skin disorders such as acne, wrinkles, psoriasis, and other inflammatory conditions. It is commonly used to speed up the healing process of wounds, cuts, burns, and sunburns because it improves the formation of scar tissues.

8268 2018-04-05 10:56:13 You do realize that big oil, automobile industry, factory farming corps, etc. are part of the free market, & get away with polluting environment as much as they can, often bribing federal agencies by using lobbyists to gain more influence? Or are you really this fucking naive?

8283 2018-04-05 10:51:26 I agree there is a big problem here to solve but some of the reporting of the issue has been so simplistic that it’s impossible to take seriously. We got our survey results published internally (Oil Co) and it wasn’t pretty headline wise but underlying reasons totally sane.

9113 2018-04-05 08:06:34 Equatorial Guinea, one of Africa's least populous countries with a population of only 1.221 million, is Africa's fourth largest producer of oil, yet 75% of its citizens live in poverty. It has been ran by President Obiang since 1979, whose son, Teodoro is his Vice President.

9169 2018-04-05 07:56:06 Intentionally. Oil is so-often a curse more than a gift.
9170 2018-04-05 07:56:04 Oil recovered and stored for sale is the end result. Hence there is assurance that all cost will be recovered within the window allowed. LT projections assume price escalation, recoverability too assumes several factors. Hence its risk that may go unrewarded.

9234 2018-04-05 07:43:02 Unfortunately NO growth is sustainable. Of course, coal/oil/(l)ng growth is much more unsustainable than solar/wind growth, though...
9235 2018-04-05 07:42:58 just started up my oil diffuser after not using it for a while and boyyyyyy have I been missing out
9236 2018-04-05 07:42:54 Also, you need to start with a few drops amd slowly increase it. I'd advise oil or cooked as it is known to be better for oral consumption than smoking. But then again, try to do research so you can take what's best for you.

9260 2018-04-05 07:38:11 It’s similar in business risk model. All big oil companies, with no exceptions, have taken write offs in billions because projections went kaput. Its risk bro.
9261 2018-04-05 07:38:09 With chronic pain surely. If you're gonna have the oil, do some research bc there are different types. Like the one my dad's having and that I'm gonna take too gives you "energy" and helps with bones stuff (among other stuff).
9262 2018-04-05 07:38:09 They have Oil, sounds like they need American freedom and democracy, send in the troops.
9263 2018-04-05 07:37:57 Word alright I never used that stuff in my hair before so you mix it and place it in a spray bottle and will the coconut oil help stop breakage that's what I have problem with when I comb it from time to time

9269 2018-04-05 07:36:57 And really REALLY far back in the day when I worked for an oil company in HR (talking 1980's here) there was still talk of men being breadwinners and so needing more money! So things have progressed, I guess it is just time.

9389 2018-04-05 07:16:23 Good point. I think they already know they have the Hama-Aleppo spine when they decide to focus there. I think they only went East once the de-escalation zones temporarily froze the NW so they went east to get the oil fields and land corridor before US-backed SDF made it there.

9441 2018-04-05 07:09:36 Actually 'peak oil' is better understood in terms of 'cost brackets' for relatively cheap and expensive oil. We have broadly peaked cheap oil, which is why the price floor is now around $40 or so. But there is no shortage of higher cost oil.

9528 2018-04-05 06:55:26 The US is on track to be the biggest net exporter of energy. I know it's a joke but if you followed the logic then Venezuela isn't where it is because of socialism but rather because of the CIA seen as it has the biggest oil reserves on earth.
9529 2018-04-05 06:55:17 We get a lot of queries on our oil scents which vary from batch to batch. This is because SOiL oils are all organic - we do not deodorise, add any flavorants or scents to the oil. The oil extracted from the plant is what goes in the bottle!
9530 2018-04-05 06:55:13 It's great that you'd rather deal w/ the buyout but a minimum of $3M in dead cap space for 3 yrs serves no purpose. Also, Sekera isn't a waste if he returns close to his previous from. Anyone who is surprised by his level this yr wasn't paying attention...just like the GM.

9560 2018-04-05 06:48:42 Absolutely. Pretty sure with the recent find of a goldmine of oil, they didn’t call it the Promised Land for nothing.

9616 2018-04-05 06:39:16 The worse injustice today is being carried out by the British. It is Nigeria. If not for the oil in the south, northern Nigeria would be just anoda Somalia
9617 2018-04-05 06:39:13 It’s quite strategic too since the discovery of oil in the Golan Heights which encroaches Syrian territory.  More oil than the entire Midfle East is in the Golan. The White Helmets were there to demonize Syria, not ISIS. Not saying Assad is great but that’s the truth.

9626 2018-04-05 06:37:30 Why is it acceptable to de-centralize federal lands and national monuments for the sake of the mining and oil industries, but not acceptable for forward-thinking states to maintain high standards for the environment? Sounds like a double standard to me.

9628 2018-04-05 06:37:18 Such a disgrace to the oil business community. No one will find a word to defend. But some time its staff or may be some techanical fault and people curse owners for everything.

9715 2018-04-05 06:19:01 It really doesnt make the case. But if you're dumb enough think that all these can be summed up under oil production topic, I'll not suffer from your limited undertanding, in general.

9752 2018-04-05 06:10:39 It's actually called fine print. The law we voted on never said they couldn't do it. They cut taxes on oil production to practically nothing and replaced the funding holes with our children's futures. Though I agree, the higher ups are over paid, but it's the least of our worries

9759 2018-04-05 06:10:06 Everyone is fighting for different and various realities. So making everything about oil profits is simply a shallow and foolish way to look at the world. Because its only one viewpoint out of an infinite amount of realities.

9777 2018-04-05 06:04:54 If I were to believe your theory about what is going on in Syria I would have to believe that ISIL & HTS, AQ, HizbAllah & many others are driven by the thirst for oil profits. Nothing could be further from the truth. They are driven by hatred & Islamic fundamentalism. Revenge.

9789 2018-04-05 06:03:20 People have sacrificed enough
1. High petrol prices even though the prices of crude oil were 50 percent less than that of Congress rule since more than 3 years now prices are 80 +. Congrats!
2. Demonitisation- I haven't seen any politician going to jail but people died in queue.
9790 2018-04-05 06:03:20 Lmaooo so y’all wanna hear what happened to my dumbass today... I put engine oil in my car and put the gallon back in my trunk and drove home, opened my trunk and smelt oil so bad and I look and it literally spilt and soaked my trunk in oil
9791 2018-04-05 06:03:07 we can tap any facilities from india whether railway line,crude oil/gas pipeline even access to bangladesh within 25 KM from eastern Nepal and they do not want to discuss.
9792 2018-04-05 06:03:01 Suit yourself. You were never going to convince me of your cookie cutter way of viewing the world anyway. Not everything is motivated by money & oil. Just because that may be what many elites want doesnt mean the needs of the many are eliminated or unimportant. Sorry.

9795 2018-04-05 06:02:47 I'm just wondering who put the oil in the all those barrels and then hid them?? 
9796 2018-04-05 06:02:39 They also have higher taxes, so all the things funded in the UK by spending oil revenue, has already been paid for by income tax in Norway. You can't have your cake and eat it.
9797 2018-04-05 06:02:32 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

9799 2018-04-05 06:02:29 yum. No olive oil. I have added fresh basil to it too. I like it better than tomatoes, basil, mozz, and balsamic. But I really like that combo too. i just prefer the tang/texture/sweetness of strawberries
9800 2018-04-05 06:02:27 4枚目が神すぎた
9801 2018-04-05 06:02:22 I tried this hair mask I saw on here - coconut oil & honey melted together and I only put it on a section that shit is so smooth and looks shiny
9802 2018-04-05 06:02:17 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
9803 2018-04-05 06:01:12 Coconut oil might help. I think my mom has some... 
Thanks, Rachel, for your advice!  I'll try a few things and let you know what works for my weird hair. Lol.
9804 2018-04-05 06:00:27 Had this the other day without strawberries and with basil. Do u put a drizzle of olive oil too. Sounds v yummy
9805 2018-04-05 06:00:17 If you look at the CEC estimates 2008 vs 2018 for California only, every gasoline price input except for oil and federal excise has basically doubled. Excise taxes have quadrupled. Oil makes up less than 50% of current price.

9809 2018-04-05 05:59:38 Europe still not serious about this grave problem. Only France seems to be considered it as serious problem 2-3 yrs back. Cheap oil is root cause of this problem.
9810 2018-04-05 05:59:33 Regardless of international factors or new oil discoveries. Petrol will go up because of our government. Cheap petrol will not assist @TurnbullMalcolm or @JoshFrydenberg plans to force Australia into electric cars.

9812 2018-04-05 05:58:51 another oil diffuser fave... lemongrass & eucalyptus oil. 
9813 2018-04-05 05:58:29 I haven't picked it, it just slid off. Eugh! That was me just out the shower so it does look dry but I've been constantly moisturizing it. Bepanthen the 1st couple of days them e45 then coconut oil. That's what I done with Chester & he was fine. I guess it's just the heavy black.

9835 2018-04-05 05:54:24 @dominicdudley Hi Dominic, was reading your article on the Bahrain oil discovery on LinkedIn, it sounds like the reservoir is very similar to the Al-Shaheen field that Qatar has, and has very tight plays. It is currently producing ~300,000 b/d

9847 2018-04-05 05:51:50 If you are talking about the oil off the coast I was probably aware. It depends. Where is it located? I recall reading many nations in the region lay claim to it. But again what does that have to do with some pre-teen boys having their dicks cutt off & sent to Mom & Dad?

9865 2018-04-05 05:48:07 Until this conversation, Pirates, were you aware that Syria had 50 billion tons of undeclared shale oil reserves? 

The exploitation potential of those resources would make Syria the 3rd or 4th power in the world in terms of oil. Were you aware of any of that prior to today?
9866 2018-04-05 05:47:55 Of complaining about what others are doing wrong maybe focus on how you can help fix the problem! Why have we not outlawed Palm Oil? An Plastic? Why is no one cleaning the trash out of the Oceans? Just fixing these 3 issues would help if there is indeed Climate Change!

9873 2018-04-05 05:46:15 Petty things? 

The calculus of power doesn't go to war over "petty" things. 

There are plenty of sources on the linkage between oil, money, the material basis of power, and the use of force and war to gain control of them. I suggest you drop the scales from your eyes.

9896 2018-04-05 05:42:12 I think its partly valid but no I am not buying the argument that it literally drives all wars into motion. Most wars are sadly fought over much more personal, sacred, cultural or petty things than oil & money.
