38 2018-10-29 22:16:50 Different types of developers lead to different types of financing mechanisms. Larger projects are more often packaged as commodities and sold to institutional lenders. Those folks tend to want “standard” products. Smaller projects with local lending r typically more flexible.

41 2018-10-29 21:47:03 Hi there! For our most recent batch, we went with that new design...but is there interest in a new set of the old ones?

Not sure what budgets and other needs will allow, but if there's demand,* that's good to know.

*Not that GSU buttons are exactly market commodities.
42 2018-10-29 21:42:08 É por causa de pensamentos como esses que o Brasil sempre será um exportador de commodities, a cadelinha dos países desenvolvidos. Ao invés de estreitar laços econômicos com países latinos e fortalecer a economia do bloco ficam se iludindo achando que os EUA vão dar a mínima

51 2018-10-29 21:07:59 Can't see how it can track typical commodities since no other commodity has a capped supply limit.
52 2018-10-29 20:56:33 Sim, ampliando programas sociais que JÁ EXISTIAM. E porque isso foi possível? Altas históricas nos preços das commodities que resultaram no aumento da arrecadação, nada criado pelo governo Lula.
53 2018-10-29 20:55:00 But in the absence of a state currency people will still trade in gold and silver because they're scarce commodities. It's not the market value I...value...it's the practical value. I'd trade in recycled copper, if need be and feel fine because it's useful.

55 2018-10-29 20:45:17 Our global economy isn’t  a supply & demand economy. It quit being so in the early 2000’s (maybe sooner).

Labor costs (most everything besides oil) & artificial price manipulation (oil & other commodities) are what drives prices.

His statement is true from this perspective.
56 2018-10-29 20:39:59 Yeah, I do. Life and health should not be treated as commodities. People's lives should not be treated as a business.
57 2018-10-29 20:32:32 Argentina exporta commodities, que no compiten por precio, ergo no vendés más cuando te bajan los costos de producción, sino explicame por qué no volaron las expo con 300 por ciento de aumento del TdC. Sin chicanas. Luego correlacioná tdC y X y verás que... la correlación no E
58 2018-10-29 20:30:46 How much have they fallen? Have they fallen for you? Less unemployment means less crime, means more social cohesion, lower prices for commodities. But it has to start somewhere.

Kemsa should decentralize its supply chain warehouses and administrative offices to county level.this would promote faster delivery of drugs and commodities and facilitate communication to its users.
61 2018-10-29 20:28:16 Widely negative swinging #StockMarket had little influence today. Are #commodities a safer haven? The November 8th crop report looms ahead. #Cattle had a poor trade today and summer #hogs are in contract highs.
62 2018-10-29 20:23:55 Hay commodities tan básicos como el maíz que los importan, otros cuántos como el PET que se producen en México se cotizan en dólares por lo que las empresas se ven forzados a comprar futuros para tener cobertura a variaciones en el ER y obvio esto lo transfieren al consumidor.
63 2018-10-29 20:23:19 E lembrar que durante o Boom das commodities o Brasil cresceu menos que a média do Mercosul, graças a uma politica de estado gigantesca, sem investimentos em infra, sem atrair investimentos.
64 2018-10-29 20:17:52 So you’re saying that the people taking out loans could have foreseen that the major lenders would bundle them together and trade the often risky bundles as commodities between lenders who could not carry the risks, and the bottom would fall out of the market?

70 2018-10-29 19:54:20 Sounds good.  Wonder why we don't have anything like that in the Middle East or on the DMZ in Korea?  Maybe because a lot of that stuff is only seen in video war games?  But what the hell, its all bull shit posturing anyway.
71 2018-10-29 19:51:43 Those who followed my advice to short Mar. Sugar at 13.85-stay short. Last 13.50.

72 2018-10-29 19:50:10 Los contextos regionales y aún mundiales eran muy diferentes, era también muy diferente la responsabilidad a la hora de tomar préstamos, porque del 2005 a la fecha además de la bonanza económica (gracias a los commodities) tomaron 3 veces la deuda a fines del 2004.
73 2018-10-29 19:50:03 Why waste the bullets on the children?  A few gunships could take them out, and the Airforce could just napalm the rest.

77 2018-10-29 19:39:57 They needed to get English access into EU fishing grounds to compensate for losing the Iceland cod war, begged for huge North Sea quotas which resulted in decimated NS fish stocks.

85 2018-10-29 19:13:55 E ainda que os americanos estejam mais ricos, não significa que torraram seus trumpzinhos com as nossas commodities. E ainda, Trump está apelando para protecionismo pra conseguir manter essa taxa de empregos. Até quando isso se sustenta?
86 2018-10-29 19:09:15 Modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities. When shoppers purchase tangible products (other than groceries), they want those items to either tell a story, fit into their lifestyle, be completely unique, or all of the above.
87 2018-10-29 19:04:36 The French?
Fishermen in England fish predominately in French and Irish EU waters. Do you think the Tories will do a deal to look after them?

French have outlawed their quotas being used as commodities so they remain in French hands.

Your deluded.
88 2018-10-29 19:01:36 95% herring quotas in Eng waters sold on to a Dutch company with English reg'd vessel. As long as quotas are treated as commodities to be sold on then the same will happen in Scotland.

Lost the cod war with iceland then demanded huge quotas from the EU that decimated NE stocks.

3.2kg-270
4.Nbo parking-300
5.eggs-11
92 2018-10-29 18:53:32 I'd guess wrong word then because commodities are either physical goods (copper and shit) or valuable limited resources (time, attention span)
93 2018-10-29 18:47:02 Apesar de nunca termos nos afastado dos EUA e Israel, de fato. Só abrimos as portas para paises como Russia e China q são grande consumidores das commodities brasileiras. Ouso dizer que possuem mais impacto que EUA e Israel, diga-se de passagem.

100 2018-10-29 18:30:26 Don’t forget the commodities market update at 2:30 pm. Looking forward to the latest corn prices & live cattle futures. You know what they say about live cattle futures? They have no futures...
101 2018-10-29 18:26:28 Better ask the question to Hollywood actress to left their promising careers, embraced Islam and started Hijab. Ask them what forced them to do Hijab. Most of them would say how they were treated as commodities and how they found dignity in Islam and Hijab.
102 2018-10-29 18:24:21 Please read my article on Mary before I share all the others. Maybe read Numbers 31 to get a feel for how virgins were treated as commodities like livestock and other plunder.
103 2018-10-29 18:20:28 Una mala fórmula: gastar a manos llenas cuando los commodities están altos, sacar así mucha gente de la pobreza, no hacer sostenible la economía con reformas sensatas, entrar en recesión y ver cómo la nueva clase media te voltea la espalda.
104 2018-10-29 18:19:27 The act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Companies like @Amazon & subscription businesses will make this easier through offerings like auto-renewals, one-tap purchases, & same-day delivery, so the routine component of shopping will become more streamlined.

106 2018-10-29 18:18:01 That is actually the nub of the matter.
Everything is so money oriented that we forget there are other more important things falling by the wayside.

115 2018-10-29 17:57:26 Very true, I can imagine the minimum wage going up to the expected N54,000 and the prices of commodities multiply by the same factor or even more as.

Brazil’s election had more to with falling living standards since the end of the commodities boom, rising crime, and corruption, all of which got blamed on the PT including by those with fond memories of Lula.
117 2018-10-29 17:49:21 Good evening cdes wherever you are. Today the fuel situation has improved greatly. Most basic food commodities which used to be in short supply are now available in most shops.@zanupf_patriots @mahwana2 @MaNondo1978 @KMutisi @GatsiBetty @edmypresident @JonesMusara @EngelbertMasum
118 2018-10-29 17:47:25 If Abacha would take us back to where things used to be in terms of prices of commodities and the value of our currency, then Abacha had better come back....
119 2018-10-29 17:46:48 Oxe, e nossas commodities, vamos vender pra quem?
120 2018-10-29 17:44:16 What will happen to those who had hoaded the commodities anticipating serious shortages?
121 2018-10-29 17:33:26 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
122 2018-10-29 17:32:10 The effect is that EU prices tend to be higher than world prices for many commodities such as beef and dairy. Therefore, half the food we import costs more than it needs to. If we abolished all food tariffs the UK market price would drop to world prices.
123 2018-10-29 17:31:30 Eu não culpo. 
A culpa é da sociedade brasileira que “relativizou” a roubalheira e a safadeza pq o país vivia o boom de commodities !
124 2018-10-29 17:19:19 Commodities markets always a balancing act.  Did u see GDP was 3.5% for 3Q?  Trump is on target for getting annual GDP above 3%!   Obama is only Pres who didn’t show sustained GDP growth.  Said days of 3% were over.
125 2018-10-29 17:16:01 Lula y Dilma presidieron los gobiernos más corruptos e ineptos de la historia de Brasil, lo cual fue disimulado durante años gracias a la burbuja de las commodities.
126 2018-10-29 17:14:17 Great to see industry leaders in #agri taking strides in digitization. #Helixtap started out with the mission of combining #commodities with technology. Happy to connect if you are looking for #Commoditech partners to kickstart this transformation.
127 2018-10-29 17:07:39 Sim, exatamente o que falei, Commodities e produtos de baixo valor agregado.

Essa questão de não ter concorrência é balela, vide a indústria automobilística: desde JK não tem NENHUMA concorrência e encontra-se anos-luz atrás das indústrias em países desenvolvidos.
128 2018-10-29 17:06:50 Accurate production of Agri commodities is a big problem today. With this amendment accurate production data would be available aiding in proper policy making & implementation. That itself will take care of many issues.

129 2018-10-29 17:04:15 Sabés 1 cosa, Gustavo? Si en los 12 años q fueron gobierno con crecimiento a tasas chinas, record en precios de commodities, mayoría en el congreso, hubieran atacado realmente la pobreza para bajarla de ese 30% histórico, nada d esto estaría pasando. El peronismo la jodió again.
130 2018-10-29 17:03:43 Be surprised if Eric Bieniemy doesn’t get an interview. Worked for Dorsey in KC and Reid’s assistants have been hot commodities lately.
131 2018-10-29 17:03:31 Am convinced these are the cartels in the maize scandal.Same thing they do with sugar.They import these commodities sell to consumers so they can have full control of the market at the expense of farmers.
132 2018-10-29 17:00:40 What about the thought of identifying their next target earlier?   Don't want to wait until February if there are hot commodities on the market.
133 2018-10-29 16:59:20 Somente é bom para exportações. No cenário atual, o Brasil exporta majoritariamente commodities (com exceção de veículos para América Latina), que tem baixo valor agregado.
Em contrapartida, importa muitos artigos de Tecnologia. O dólar alto dificulta exatamente a renovação do...
134 2018-10-29 16:58:54 ¿De esos 25 millones que salieron cuando el precio de los commodities estaba por los cielos, cuántos volvieron cuando eso se terminó? Y de la corrupción ni hablamos ¿verdad? ¡Saludos!
135 2018-10-29 16:50:56 Progress on Kipling Orbital continues as less then 240k tons of commodities are now needed for full station repair. As always, Beryllium is the most required commodity. 
Great work CMDR’s! o7
136 2018-10-29 16:43:35 Would be about time :D Amazing gap between large cap tech and commodities/shipping/EM.
137 2018-10-29 16:43:08 Thx for this! DXY: indeed dificult, but would agree to be ST weaker, but should catch a bid with yields moving down...so gold up, dxy up with lower yields. Interesting to see then how rest of commodities will play it ( imo down with oil). Cheers

142 2018-10-29 16:19:08 Because we need to move away from buying the commodities which make our adversaries wealthy. Russia and extremist governments of the Middle East are the baneficiaries of the fossil fuel economy....dummy.
143 2018-10-29 16:12:04 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
144 2018-10-29 16:05:43 Yes, market breadth very thin in the latest leg up in the US market. Hopefully the market will turn its attention to the value in heavily punished names and sectors such as commodities or EM
145 2018-10-29 15:53:13 Farmers should continue hoarding the maize until there is a deliberate move to put one bag of maize at not less than kshs 3000 to cover production cost and make a little profit. It is only maize price that comes down, other commodities remain constant or go up . Never down.
146 2018-10-29 15:52:08 I am interesting in knowing the effect on the #commodities market in #SanPaulo after the election of #jairmessiasbolsonaro as president of #Brazil. #bullishorbearish #maze #corn #soya #soybeans #watchingitcarefully

148 2018-10-29 15:49:34 By creating trade deals with other countries, Trump is in fact creating jobs and commerce in all countries involved. The influx of commodities in and out require more board patrol and more customs agents as well as diversifying products and retail opportunities.

151 2018-10-29 15:39:32 @burkese and her Resource Security project here @NewAmerica are a fantastic, uh, resource on the intersection between security and commodities both obvious and obscure.

153 2018-10-29 15:23:49 As long as animals are seen as commodities, instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable. Sheep DON'T need to be sheared UNLESS they're bred to grow more wool than would ever be necessary.

156 2018-10-29 15:22:04 O custo das commodities são realmente baixos, elas são matéria-prima, não o produto formado. Com o processo de desindustrialização que o Brasil vem sofrendo, não temos condições de processar o que produzimos para vender um produto final valorizado
157 2018-10-29 15:17:48 O plano econômico do PT deu errado porque eles demoraram a tomar frente na crise de commodities e segurar/esconder índices em nome de um projeto podre de reeleição. 
O plano econômico do Bolsonaro mexe com estruturas e castas sociais. Infinitamente mais profundo e permanente.

160 2018-10-29 15:14:52 its why "stay the fuck out of the front" is good advice; its true in commodities into expiration too.

161 2018-10-29 15:10:28 I'm guessing it's because he's a horrible, ignorant ass, no manners, no class, no humility, no humanity, no guilt, no empathy. When you start like that, you don't change. Those things are not exactly supermarket commodities.

163 2018-10-29 15:07:32 It isn't the fact that it was carried out mainly by whites that made it so pernicious. It was the invention of the idea that black people were subhuman in order to justify that level of cruelty. To turn human beings into commodities. And it's persistence.
164 2018-10-29 15:06:01 Down until the 5th... still convinced that EU countries and BRICS will begin trading oil and commodities outside of the USD beginning with Iranian sanctions. This is just speculation based on statements by the respective country leaders, specifically putin, who is most outspoken

170 2018-10-29 14:44:30 Pensei a mesma coisa. E a resposta dele não é novidade nenhuma, já disseram que irão fortalecer as relações com mercados fortes, como o asiático, americano e europeu. Não somos obrigados a vender nossas commodities a preço de banana para um mercado que não tem nada a oferecer.
171 2018-10-29 14:39:36 Até porque os EUA prejudica muito o comércio exterior brasileiro com as imensas restrições e proteção à produtos como as commodities
172 2018-10-29 14:30:26 Yeah, but you can argue that the overall improvement of Brazil was due to the fact we fixed out hyperinflation problem, which made banks increase their disponibility of credit, a huge increase in commodities values and many internacional investments
173 2018-10-29 14:29:55 Love your articles. Fun fact - in Tennessee we don't get government cheese with the commodities. Could you hook me up if you know anyone that gets it?
174 2018-10-29 14:24:31 Não, era a que o Brasil surfava na onda das commodities e conseguiu fechar um ciclo virtuoso que tirou milhões de família da miséria e da fome. Eu não nego a corrupção nos governos do PT, mas é perturbadora a sua tendência (e de seus companheiros de voto) de negar a História.
175 2018-10-29 14:23:12 It's just great entertainment, and someone needs to call this shit out.

181 2018-10-29 14:01:05 O PT não assumiu erros na condução econômica? Vc deve estar de sacanagem, inclusive espero que seja isso, mesmo que esses erros sejam ínfimos e que a queda no preço das commodities tenha sido muito mais determinante do que isso, e a canalhice de quem embolsou as desonerações

184 2018-10-29 13:54:05 The whole art of post-consumer living consists in getting rid of commodities in order to avoid being alone with them, in fleeing from possessions while searching for one single spirit in oneself.  Too bad that means putting all one's eggs in one basket.
185 2018-10-29 13:41:11 Yes, I saw the interview, Leigh was great, he wasn't giving an inch. extremely obstinate which in itself suggests culpability.
Unfortunately, cricket has become a business & players are commodities to be used up & spat out by the machine. Like so many, have lost their true north.

187 2018-10-29 13:34:21 And let’s not forget the original article this thread started on about free market. An unchecked free market leads to unspeakable conditions for people who become commodities to the market. Not a socialist but I firmly believe markets have limits or we see the worst of greed

204 2018-10-29 11:22:22 People need to realise how markets (commodities and Currencies) work. Higher global crude price + lower AUD = higher domestic petrol price. It’s not politically driven.

209 2018-10-29 10:54:05 I think a study of  commodities and their suppliers and market share would reveal a highly concentrated oligopolitic and therefore inefficient market place in Zimbabwe. The competition commission should have such information but don't hold your breath.
210 2018-10-29 10:53:44 A Eleição de ontem sacramenta uma mudança de rumos para o país. Esta guinada ocorreu a há dois anos com a queda do PT na parte política e com a retomada dos preços das commodities em especial o petróleo e o minério de ferro na parte econômica.

224 2018-10-29 09:45:39 Many "left" communists enjoy smugly phrasing basic Marxist theory to look smart. "The abolition of the value-form"?
