5 2018-05-13 23:01:25 This is well stated. I get and agree with you points. But I think you left out the biggest issue: professional youth coaches. Far too many youth coaches make their primary paycheck in youth sports. Kids aren't commodities and parents aren't ATMs. Would like to see that included.

11 2018-05-13 22:13:06 this would be the case if BTC supply was reduced (no/fewer blocks produced) in response to lower prices. This is not the case in BTC, as unlike other commodities where supply adjusts to price, in BTC it's predetermined, hence causation is only price -> hashpower
12 2018-05-13 22:12:55 I rent land to a farmer. One yr corn next yr soybeans. Sometimes winter wheat. Equipment used made for these commodities costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then there are silos & drying equipment. You can’t just switch.

14 2018-05-13 21:59:48 You really think that our collective subjectivity as consumers determines, in the long run, the exchange rate between two commodities? Then the best way to reduce the exchange value of certain commodities is to hire a psychologist, right?
15 2018-05-13 21:58:01 I know i will be getting some slack because of this tweet but its the trued.

That has came to my mind throughout the years, still here without proper housing and many other commodities and very little done for them except to the selfserved invaders... Then emigrants.

40 2018-05-13 21:18:52 “Asset class” is a common name for investments... and investments can be securities or commodities or etc. When its a theoretical future value... more like a security than a commodity. Making up legal categories doesn’t usually work too well...you take risk of being wrong.
41 2018-05-13 21:16:41 La diferencia entre el proceso iniciado en la década de 1930/1940 en Argentina y el decenio 2003/2013 es de contexto. Aquél tiene como transfondo la crisis del 29, las guerras mundiales y la hegemonía de EEUU. El último, tasas bajas y commodities altos.

44 2018-05-13 20:47:44 Oil is only really a major sector for Norway, but the other nations are heavy in other commodities but a lot of that is state owned so benefits go back into welfare state and education.

46 2018-05-13 20:25:51 Marx does not deny this kind of value. 
He want to understand Economic Relations not why people like stuff. 

He uses use-value, exchange-value(price) and labour-value not as competing theories but as different properties of commodities.
47 2018-05-13 20:23:10 From Ireland & Australia - even tho banned - as well as UK - I am ashamed & we are fighting this! Unfortunately they are not seen as pets & don’t have the same rights - they are commodities
48 2018-05-13 20:21:50 EFF wants to treat people like commodities. If you use the land the way they think is appropriate you stay on that land otherwise you are removed. To where? Who will decide where you must be sent to? What about the elderly and the sickly? Won't they be sent to remote areas?

50 2018-05-13 20:09:42 Yeah, I worked in the corporate world for over 20 years, slick. I was a commodities trader and then did supply chain and logistics so I know what I am talking about. You cited an area where we have a trade surplus with China as an example of where tariffs are working. Sit down.
51 2018-05-13 19:51:28 I honestly think that the whole sentence is spurious talk. As a consumer, I have objective necessities and hopefully money to buy commodities which satisfy them. If the commodity is produced under competition, the market price of this commodity will tend towards its natural price
52 2018-05-13 19:27:19 So, basically: the children need to be raised by godly women, not whoever is fertile. Handmaids are too precious to lock down to one man. This system actually maintains biblical norms (Rachel & Leah). Handmaids & children are commodities.
53 2018-05-13 19:26:35 Ahhh yes, the classic ignorant response. Because commodities wouldn't exist in a socialist or communist or anarchist society, right? Because the internet wouldn't exist? Why the hell do you think this? You wanna talk about complexities NOT being so cut and dry, holy crap.
54 2018-05-13 19:26:01 You keep saying you are against fraudsters and thieves. Yh

But yet you sell commodities that a person earning money legally can't afford.Only thieves can afford it

You are a thief also... No?,den stop chasing after exorbitant and outrageous gains that only thieves can pay for

56 2018-05-13 19:20:34 Also, how are we defining 'Commodities'? An energy heavy index like the GSCI or CRB, or something like the equal weight old CRB?
57 2018-05-13 19:18:50 Screw it here's the answer afaik: in this world women are commodities. The Wives are high status women, apart from their barrenness. Many of them were married to the commanders before the war, and like Serena Joy were even advocates for Gilead. They're proper godly wives.

63 2018-05-13 18:33:35 He is only interested in analysis of commodities and their circulation, if you produce something without subjective value for anyone else it will never really enter the market.
64 2018-05-13 18:31:36 If I remember correctly, Marx doesn't even consider products without use-value commodities.
65 2018-05-13 18:28:42 Is this available anywhere? Not an academic but very interested in social care for adults and children. Disabled ppl becoming commodities.
66 2018-05-13 18:28:22 Why not just set up a sustainable value chain for all agricultural commodities? This one step would  resolve post harvest losses and ensure linkages to markets!
67 2018-05-13 18:09:03 Finish commodities/indices tonight and tomorrow morning
68 2018-05-13 18:06:25 I agree that the citizens should help with the conservation of these commodities, but I think the main culprit is WASA aided by the Trade Union.

74 2018-05-13 17:18:52 Consumption of commodities is a necessity under capitalism. Part of what makes capitalism coercive is that it forces people into exchange relations to procure all of their wants/needs. 

Also, how specifically are you defining commodity here

76 2018-05-13 16:40:31 O agronegócio dobrou de tamanho nos 13 anos de PT. O crédito rural passou de 25bi para 175bi. E os mal agradecidos ruralistas não agradecem nem reconhecem.
De outro lado, porém, as externalidades ambientais e sociais são trágicas. 
Nosso papel no mundo foi reduzido a commodities.

83 2018-05-13 16:01:32 Baffling only if you're not a woman and don't have any empathy for them as fellow human beings. For everyone else, being baffled that women won't want to be treated as market commodities instead of people isn't baffling at all.
84 2018-05-13 15:50:10 ARE IDEAS COMMODITIES?
85 2018-05-13 15:49:24 Yes, although 'cobalt to nothing' may be a Elon-ism, they have reduced it drastically, and Cobalt really was my biggest worry for scalability of primarily the energy solutions. Without commodities being the limiting factor, the battery storage really could revolutionise the world

90 2018-05-13 15:21:13  black folk have been seen as objects/commodities since they were first forced into this country. It’s ingrained in a lot of people. More often than not, we don’t get to have full discretion over our bodies. We never have.

93 2018-05-13 14:58:05 Es compatible con un país q al solo exportar commodities, cuando sube el dólar producto del gasto público, suben los precios de los alimentos. Este es el riesgo de ser el granero del mundo. De exportar mano de obra, bajando impuestos al valor agregado no habría corelación directa

96 2018-05-13 14:39:25 There are many societies that view women as commodities. You can collect them like dolls. Perhaps Mr. Hamid is aligned with that mentality.
97 2018-05-13 14:38:24 Higher taxation for the 1% of the richest in our society I hope you mean? And less money spent on dropping bombs in Syria, and no money being sent to China that provides the world with its commodities, less money going to grammar schools etc, etc
98 2018-05-13 14:25:09 Pero acá no hay oligarquía burguesa. Acá nadie produce casi nada excepto el agro. Vivimos exportando commodities, y ofreciendo servicios (no exportables).
O sea, ¿quién querés que plante las bases para el desarrollo del país? ¿El agro matando al agro y quedándonos sin dólares?
99 2018-05-13 14:22:25 Some should be securities, some currencies, some commodities, some a mixture of those categories, and some something entirely new. The difference between different projects is huge, they can't all be neatly filed under current descriptions. This is something new.

103 2018-05-13 13:39:07 Dude, they don't add to the economy. They just inflate it, make it artificial. The laws of demand and supply don't apply anymore. Prices of several commodities have skyrocketed e.g land, rent. Due to too much artificial money. They hurt the economy bro.

114 2018-05-13 12:39:49 America will never -be- America without a white social consensus. The very idea of a social consensus without a white population is impossible; it’s a uniquely white idea. Furthermore, turning native pops into brown commodities serves a dystopian, not a utopian purpose. Backward
115 2018-05-13 12:39:10 It's not just capitalism though women as commodities and belonging to males as chattel precedes capitalism and markets  men think they have a human right to sex. What they learn can be un learnt.  Blaming everything on capitalism is evasive and dishonest.

128 2018-05-13 10:43:58 I find a lot of commodities pointless. I work in a factory making things that aren't completely pointless, but if you're making trash entertainment, trash items, stuff that destroys nature more than it benefits man, a worker SHOULD feel it is pointless despite "function".
129 2018-05-13 10:37:24 MCX is far more linked to Global commodities. I doubt a similar pattern in Stocks. Also, the primary market hours haven't lost relevance for most Stock Markets around the World after Extension. Only thing is relatively lower volumes in Extended Hours.

131 2018-05-13 09:54:51 Capital is currentlly the most effective sorcery operative on the planet because it's adept at transforming banal objects into sublimely mysterious commodities. Trans-substantiation. The allure of the commodity arises from the non-coincidence of the object with itself.
132 2018-05-13 09:51:03 True, as they either make their wealth by invading and looting other countries of their commodities. Or by selling arms and other weapons of war to despotic nations, such as Saudi or Israel, to name but two

Pick a market whether it be #FX, #Commodities, #Cyrpto or #Indices 
Pick one!
Learn how it moves, look for repeating patterns that can be a tell to a change in trend.
Use divergence 
Watch key levels

Play big on 1 market rather than small on lots of markets

144 2018-05-13 06:39:55 Also, shouldn't these tweets and that hypothetical dissertation not start from the position that women aren't just commodities? Because that's what you're saying.
145 2018-05-13 06:18:09 You mean assume women are commodities to be distributed amongst men?
146 2018-05-13 06:17:33 @flyamritsar Please do something to operationalize Cargo Centre for export of Fresh n processed food commodities.
147 2018-05-13 05:45:21 some commodities trader bullshitting about Obama, Forgive me, but Obama wasn't the mayor of Chicago. And this asshole talking about getting rich
148 2018-05-13 05:44:34 Fa, es la primera vez que escucho decir a alguien decir que no somos productivos agricolamente. 1er problema, los precios de las commodities son precios aceptantes porque hay competencia en ese mercado. Mejorar la productividad no genera una ganancia extraordinaria en ese caso
149 2018-05-13 05:36:45 Some of these programs need awareness, dishing out new commodities without providing the general public with the basic information on how they work can cause a problem
150 2018-05-13 05:33:16 Let economics controls itself. We don't want a system of dictacting prices for commodities ignoring the cost of production.
151 2018-05-13 05:30:00 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
152 2018-05-13 05:26:25 When the commodities price rising, it's always a bad news for those who struggle and lives with less than 2 US $ per day in Haiti. Strkes, riots can occur. Above all, as a nation, we need to work on and fix what makes us so weak, so vulnerable.
153 2018-05-13 05:02:13 It’s good news to have commodities increasing while the dollar gains strength. A inflationary rally in WTI cancelled out by a deflationary rally in the dollar.
154 2018-05-13 04:35:47 #WarAgainstDowry 
The abolition of dowry is the need of the hour. Young boys should realize that they are not commodities to be sold to the highest bidder.
Young ladies should refuse to marry the young men whose parents are greedy.

155 2018-05-13 04:34:32 Everything does. Even anti-establishment material is now sweetened to saccharine, boxed up and shrink-wrapped to be sold in tiny  bites that are easy to swallow but ultimately won’t spoil the appetite for the commodities of the machine and we will never change.
156 2018-05-13 04:20:31 You complain on so many issue yet you take zero actions,
Do you have any powers to deal with issues affecting consumers.
High prices of basic commodities, Fuel & electricity, counterfeit.......
157 2018-05-13 04:13:14 It will, cause UAH is undervalued. Oil went up from 40 to 70 usd per barrel. But UAHvsUSD stays roughly the same. Ukraine exports only commodities dependent on the price of oil. @NBUkraine is bunch of incompetent thieves and clowns serving big oligarchs.

Dowry is a tool of  harassment and inhuman expression out of the coalescence of processes and relationship which are degrading women turning then in to commodities.
Sant Rampalji Maharaj is eradicating this evil from our society.
Must watch Ishwar TV 8:30 pm
166 2018-05-13 02:14:48 But only in theory, because it's not upsetting at all to discuss the removal of anyone's autonomy. It's not like women are concerned about being referred to as commodities.
167 2018-05-13 02:05:38 All the best everyone for the rally later on today. Thank you always for speaking out & fighting for the long overdue end of this barbaric live export sham where somehow animals are treated as commodities instead of actual living beings. #WeWillRiseUp
168 2018-05-13 02:05:00 Completely different. NGP is an export line. EE is just moving commodities across the country. It still makes the most economic sense and will be built one day. Not sure by who tho
169 2018-05-13 02:04:35 Historically, yes. When sentiment in the stock market slows or declines, people typically look to assets and commodities to protect their wealth. Those assets usually surge due to the influx in demand as a safe haven.
170 2018-05-13 01:58:50 About little *brown* kids. Their own kids are precious commodities, obviously.
171 2018-05-13 01:24:26 It sounds nice on the surface but lots of unintended consequences. Especially in a self-employed “contract“ demand-driven profession like acting. 

If I starred in a movie with an A-list actor, me a nobody yet, I expect to make considerably less. 

Actors are not commodities.
172 2018-05-13 01:05:08 If that is really true , you must be one of the very few consumers that believes it. There are vast differences of nutritional value in commodities. Why do we feed our livestock balanced rations ? Yet people are willing to eat anything just for taste and colour.
173 2018-05-13 01:04:28 existing commodities that tear value from meaning
174 2018-05-13 00:57:25 Fue coyuntural porque lo que venía desde afuera no se podía cambiar. Y Uruguay no podía hacer subir el precio internacional de la carne y de nuestros commodities. Y la parte estructural venía de toda la vida. Batlle no podía en 1 año y medio cambiar lo que venía mal desde décadas
175 2018-05-13 00:57:06 It's just that hey this time women aren't literal commodities
176 2018-05-13 00:52:14 They bought a bunch of commodities related business, but mostly they financed directly a bunch of African and Latin American states and payment is in  those commodities and public contracts. So just exploration while debt instruments made countries dependent on Chinese cash
177 2018-05-13 00:49:45 Maybe when he wants to start mining asteroids to disrupt the commodities... that'll bankroll the Mars colony ;)
178 2018-05-13 00:07:03 And it’s important to not turn them into capitalist commodities
179 2018-05-13 00:03:36 Entendo que commodities são cíclicas, aqui vale como nunca o "comprar na baixa e vender na alta", mas a gente sempre fica na torcida de uma corrigida. hahahaha

181 2018-05-12 23:42:44 Seeing as in the US, one govt agency sees #cryptocurrencies as property, another as money, a third as commodities and yet another as securities, it is easy to see why #innovation is so difficult and how some small states are going to clean up as crypto-friendly jurisdictions

183 2018-05-12 23:03:07 El kirchnerismo uso mucho de su propaganda para lograr que eso tuviera una lógica. Lo raro es que nadie haya explicado que si eso fue así porque el #campo fue la herramienta de la distribución del ingreso y ninguna otra en la economía durante el boom de los commodities
184 2018-05-12 22:31:33 Olha, a corrupção é muita e deplorável mesmo. Mas, estatisticamente é irrelevante. A merda veio foi com a economia desestruturada junto a queda das commodities e crescimento explosivo do gasto público com despesas obrigatórias.

185 2018-05-12 22:20:07 Nessa época, o Brasil surfou na onda impulsionada pela China, compradora das commodities brasileiras e pela alta dos preços das mesmas. Essa onda foi mal aproveitada, pelo governo PTista, que só pensava nos dividendos da corrupção. Acho que o fato acima, ele não saiba

192 2018-05-12 21:29:19 Not sure why Modi's visit is being valued so much. He put a blockade in Nepal for several months where people were left without fuel, gas and other commodities. Our leaders need to have a basic understanding of diversifying resources coming into the country.

219 2018-05-12 20:04:46 That's not a good link to make, saying abuse in Hollywood was okay because some women got money.
I've said before that this is similar to what Bruno did to girls, treated them like commodities and kicked out those who were a problem for him. He saw himself as a businessman.

222 2018-05-12 19:52:07 It actually sucks that people reduce themselves to being commodities for others to consume. There is nothing social in that practice.
223 2018-05-12 19:51:18 Yeah, why can't modern societies just understand that women are commodities that should be distributed equally amongst men?
224 2018-05-12 19:49:19 Demonetization of @BJP4India resulted in loss of 90 lakh jobs between October 2016- October 2017.

226 2018-05-12 19:44:40 I can’t believe that animals are ACTUALLY treated like commodities.

247 2018-05-12 16:34:57 1% owning just 50% is radically more just distribution than Under Resources and Capital (fiat + commodities + credit) in Global capitalism
248 2018-05-12 16:32:37 This is stubborn relationship of dogs with human. They were great friend at the beginning of human civilization then it's a mystery when human started hate dogs and treated them as a commodities in food industry. Don't you feel after seen this video at least?
249 2018-05-12 16:29:34 $FPI - decent yield with exposure to commodities & not retail
250 2018-05-12 16:18:14 Gold is not inert. It's relation to commodities is also elastic. Gold gets revalued in real terms from time to time. ie gold could go to 10k in 2010 dollars. 10k US gold does not mean $1000 oil.

256 2018-05-12 15:18:45 Could Russian government animus against HRC be overemphasized rather than an intent to support candidates who are open to repealing or not enforcing economic sanctions against them? Clinton wouldn't have done that. The Russian economy is pretty dependent on commodities, like oil.

259 2018-05-12 15:03:52 Yes we need to wean ourselves from being sellers of raw commodities and focus on value addition of our commodities. Otherwise we will reach the next 1000 years very very poor. We need to rethink anf Focus.#panafrican

261 2018-05-12 15:01:13 Maybe when wheat hits $1000 we could take note! Or what could be a theoretical critical $ value of commodities?
262 2018-05-12 14:49:44 After all the politics onion for today, I'm safe to say that, I appreciate my beloved Selangorians. Much Respect and Thank you for our MB @AzminAli for all the fights he took for us. Hopefully the rate of billing will stay the same and all other commodities will be added more. 
263 2018-05-12 14:46:03 @graddhybpc appreciate the analysis. It lines up perfectly with a 2020-2021 global top in commodities and risk assets.
264 2018-05-12 14:42:57 That’s always the better way to go. Commodities that always hold value. I tell that to all the money hoarders sticking cash in their sheets. They are losing in inflation and also at anytime can become as valuable as toilet paper.
265 2018-05-12 14:40:54 Whats the point in sweating on the #KarnatakaVoting. This #BJP never cares for the verdict and all it needs is a minimum of one winner and the rest they just buy as if they are commodities. Unless #Congress gets above 115, I dont see any other way.

268 2018-05-12 14:18:18 Perhaps tougher laws can be placed when lawmakers look beyond these animals as merely being commodities or possessions, but living breathing entities capable of emotions.
269 2018-05-12 14:01:53 Expecting Congress win. Demonization, price hike in petrol and diesel, hike in train fares, house hold commodities may effect the BJP win.

Xi is doing the secret meetings etc
what can Pompeo offer? Central banking and economic commodities, and unblocking one or two of the UN sanctions.. everything else still applies
278 2018-05-12 12:15:44 What he needs to do is raise the import taxations ! Any foreign countries that want to sale commodities I'm the U.S.A has to pay an extra $2.00 per package. If they raise the rates on America then we can play the same way !
279 2018-05-12 12:11:08 Once again, I don’t disagree with his right to refuse. I just don’t agree with his reasoning. I don’t treat celebs as commodities. Much like Samuel L Jackson himself, I expect human decency & common courtesy. You can’t expect it from people and not practice it yourself.
280 2018-05-12 12:00:09 With China decelerating and consuming less shouldn’t we see a decrease in commodities?

288 2018-05-12 11:07:46 Thanks, my outlook is  by early July 2018 we should have zig zagged to up to 95.00 , from where the sustained drop in $DXY over next many months should start to atleast 81.00/82.00 levels accompanied by a secular rise in gold, silver and commodities from early July 2018 onward

290 2018-05-12 11:01:24 This ugly reversal was screaming long time looking at such long position in Euro . I am not sure it will be a real recovery. Draghi the Euro bender will soon see his inflation near but close due to Euro , Commodities price convergence. And They have to tapper printing machine!
291 2018-05-12 10:57:05 oh yes first of all direct income tax is not flat 20% it varies, plus you add 18% tax on all commodities add vat to sales tax, now add property tax to that and rsst of hidden taxes to that it comes upto alot more
292 2018-05-12 10:52:28 Typical sell the news case? It is so crazy to see how paper trading is pricing in everything in advance for commodities.
293 2018-05-12 10:39:47 Igualzinho ao Brasil. Não prestou atenção aos avisos que o ciclo de commodities iria acabar.
294 2018-05-12 10:28:08 Time to suspend and permanently scrap the oppressive inflation-causing excise tax on fuel that triggered the skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities, utilities and services! Much of which only goes to pockets of corrupt trapos! 
295 2018-05-12 10:27:20 Some three years ago the Government of India invested in commodities in Africa to buffer for the shortfall in India, is this now bearing fruit hence the application for Imports? @meerasanyal
296 2018-05-12 10:17:34 I’ve seen people on the street complaining commodities went off, Shey the exchange rate surge up too
297 2018-05-12 10:09:00 The price for african commodities are made in the UK /no supply & demand system/regulated by cartels/Jewish mafias"slavery for 100 yrs more
298 2018-05-12 09:53:12 The idea suggested by Sri.Subramania swamy to abolish Income Tax needs to be implemented immediately. Also  the Govt should collect taxes in all commodities a very meagre - 1% to 3% in GST and at the sametime should not allow traders to take credit from their purchasing bills.
299 2018-05-12 09:43:20 Europe will pick up the Euro trade overnight, the metals and commodities will go everywhere else (because it's cheaper, less regulated, and there's no critical mass left from the Euro trade for companies to run whole of shop operations)
300 2018-05-12 09:26:32 Hardly. It is absolutely clear revenues to be Australian government for exported commodities are de minimus by comparison with other exporting countries. You seem relaxed about it. I am not
301 2018-05-12 09:17:01 Great essay. And so true that women and girls are still treated as commodities.

304 2018-05-12 08:49:37 Asked  why the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Transport, announced the  sudden increase in prices of subway tickets from Friday morning, saying  that cigarettes, sugar and other commodities can be accumulated if they  are aware of the increase in prices before.
305 2018-05-12 08:44:26 You miss the point. Wellhead value is determined & minimised by the energy majors. Costs should not be compounded forward at 20%, but are. Corporate tax is never paid because of the above. In sum, revenues to Aus for exported commodities from Aus are minimal. That’s incompetent
306 2018-05-12 08:34:25 We weren’t there so have no idea of context. He has the right to refuse; he did. People talk to celebrities as if they are commodities, it happens a lot.

309 2018-05-12 08:23:52 Can’t read article (paywall) but absolutely. Students not commodities - we should only recruit the number we can get to know and give pastoral care to. Yes they are adults but many vulnerable - University is stressful.
310 2018-05-12 08:02:31 My limited point here is that nothing has value in & of itself. Not commodities, not land, not inhabitable property. It all depends on subjective factors like one's needs, means, priorities etc.
311 2018-05-12 07:59:52 Mises' theory about currencies ideally being tied to commodities does not imply that the commodities in question have any intrinsic value. I'm not disagreeing with Mises here...in fact, I take a more aggressive Rothbardian line on this question.

314 2018-05-12 07:35:18 With strategic commodities like oil and gold, effort put into production (drilling, mining, etc) is a function of value, not the other way around.  Maybe I really am an idiot?

they plan to use immigrants as commodities.
apparently the const. doesn't guaranteed them any rights.
344 2018-05-12 02:33:34 Absolutely right. No direct tax but except basic commodities  everthing should be taxed in propertion to its price.  Whether citizens  spend or save, it will helpfor better economic growth.
345 2018-05-12 02:31:59 +\- 30% over 5 years is not unusual for most asset classes (currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc.) The subject of volatility is covered in most business schools.
346 2018-05-12 02:30:55 Let's keep this simple. The President, no matter who, can make decisions that ultimately can influence gasoline price. If you don't believe that then you don't have a very good understanding of what can drive the price of commodities, both positively and negatively.
347 2018-05-12 02:25:57 Calm yourself. I’m talking numbers, not commodities. You okay?
348 2018-05-12 02:19:37 It's gotta be more than that because commodities haven risen and fallen over the decades...

Hillary could have used her commodities acumen to make 10,000% returns any time.
361 2018-05-12 00:50:29 The market controls commodities for the most part.  And distribution also requires a commodity. Fuel.
362 2018-05-12 00:40:43 This is the exact interpretation on my mind. Manage this small lies before I add more to it for you. Shame/Integrity are an expensive commodities that our public office holders can afford. Not only lack it but won't buy it.

370 2018-05-11 23:26:41 Yes I have served. I don't think you get the reactive, limited morality of your statement. Teaching people to respect and value others - regardless of their demographic - is humane and ethical. Those that are afraid to be alone with another view people as commodities.

373 2018-05-11 22:55:28 We import more than 600million canned tomato into Ghana from China whilst our farmers tomato yield are wasted in the farm. Tomato is one of the major commodities that can create a lot of jobs for Ghana if processed. We are working for China.

404 2018-05-11 21:54:48 Day traders like volatile commodities and volatile stocks. They seek to gain from sharp, sudden swings in the price of what they are trading. Day trading @GrayscaleInvest shares is like day trading on steroids (or, given its addictive qualities, day trading on crack). /2
405 2018-05-11 21:53:41 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
406 2018-05-11 21:40:48 Drill, baby, drill. Gas prices under control as well as many other commodities bc production costs go down. Also, lower oil prices reduced terrorism funding and Russian military expansionism

410 2018-05-11 21:28:13 The military is full of them because our government markets the military to poor and immigrant and minority CHILDREN.  It views them as commodities, sending them off to die to line rich white men’s pockets.

419 2018-05-11 20:46:11 Jimthe tax cut wasn’t a hand out but proportional to how much u pay in taxes. Gas prices are supply/demand and not Trumps fault. They wd have gone up regardless. It’s a balancing act.  Some goods/commodities up, some down all the time. That’s how business works
420 2018-05-11 20:43:56 The critique of capitalism entails a ruthless demolition of commodity-theology & its support in the social fetish of the 'free individual': the full confidence in the 'reality' of our free individuality is the ideological feint allowing us to act as if commodities are autonomous
421 2018-05-11 20:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

424 2018-05-11 20:30:56 CAD is correlated to commodities. I'm more interested in $SJR and $RCI after the currency tanks as a + carry way to bet on recovery.
425 2018-05-11 20:24:53 If only it were! That said, rights and commodities aren’t mutually exclusive either (e.g. we offer energy assistance to low income families who can’t pay their heating bills)
426 2018-05-11 20:17:03 Today felt like as if nobody wanted to hold commodities over the weekend.  
427 2018-05-11 20:16:13 Misogyny is rampant in the Pro Life movement. They only seem to care about unborn children. Women and children walking the earth are nothing more than commodities. Guess they skipped that part of the Bible.
428 2018-05-11 20:12:42 Commodities, how do they work?
429 2018-05-11 19:54:22 Access and influence are valuable commodities.  Arranging a meeting with a decision maker is very valuable.
430 2018-05-11 19:52:31 There you go using facts and logic on an issue.

Those are unknown commodities when blind hatred is in play.
431 2018-05-11 19:49:58 1. Yes. Not just gas. All commodities 2. Yes also. But I care less. It is natural for international conglomerates to seek to reduce tax exposure for shareholders. But for the Aus Govt to fail to get paid for its assets is just plain (easily fixed, incomprehensible!) negligence

434 2018-05-11 19:37:37 It's an open secret to be honest. Things have worsened since they did that audit. We don't get commodities bi-monthly as they are supposed to supply and despite being told about the loopholes they maintain them. I pray global fund won't leave us to dry.
435 2018-05-11 19:18:05 Which commodities look good in 18?

437 2018-05-11 19:11:10 No, it's naive to keep doing what we've been doing for decades: depending on the "free market" to somehow keep drugs affordable. The problem is, there's no incentive for the private market to do so, since these drugs aren't elastic commodities. Government negotiation is a must.
438 2018-05-11 19:07:09 Since #crudeoil leeds oil stocks, $WTI should drop next week or even in the current hour since its lagging and in a substantial didvergence.

440 2018-05-11 18:41:27 Honestly I haven't seen how these statistics have improved the living conditions of the average Nigerian. Commodities are still on the rise, no  good heath care, killings are on the rise, infrastructures are on the decline etc
441 2018-05-11 18:33:58 If we nazis win, we give them a $5 spear. Take their AK's. Prevent greedy whites, Arabs and Chinese to take their commodities and let them be. Someone like  @VibeHi should be the emperor of Africa and if he is sick we fly him to our best hospital on Planet Pluto!

446 2018-05-11 18:06:39 Why the F do people continue to ‘back’ coins by things? They don’t need crypto for this. Normal tokens without backing are simple commodities. There is no reason to guarantee their value in fiat. Good projects simply encourage the participation in a network.

450 2018-05-11 17:57:17 Reminder: your class is not defined by the commodities you consume but rather by your place in the process of commodity production
451 2018-05-11 17:53:59 These people worried about the wrong things. And I’m convinced at least have of them only view the clients as commodities. It’s disgusting.

As you are doing so well in rd construction why not to creat cold storages at nodal pts where cities/ villages which are producing bulk of our daily commodities May be dry/ fresh can be stored.
459 2018-05-11 17:31:12 Right but the fundamental problem of actors getting paid wildly different salaries for the same work is grounded in them being commodified on a market. Of course sexism affects that market, but if they weren't commodities the effect of sexism would be substantially reduced/ended

467 2018-05-11 17:06:46 From Romaine lettuce, potted beef to eggs; basic commodities that the average people purchase. We have never experienced so many recalls & illness with basic food items, until this administration. There has been no real governance, let alone quality & effectiveness from the top.
468 2018-05-11 17:03:17 As if we needed media to know that fuel now sold 145 while subsidy still exist or we needed media to know that price of commodities in the mket are out reach for  Nigerians .u can tell a blind man that oil is not in a soup but can't tell Him/her weather there is salt or not
469 2018-05-11 16:51:08 If you want to know where equities are going, watch equities. Bonds, currencies, commodities don’t know.
470 2018-05-11 16:50:00 but the dog clearly hasn't grasped that money is the universal medium of exchange, he's misunderstood it as one commodity among many comparable commodities (leaves), this is mimetic behaviour
471 2018-05-11 16:49:43 Why is it that when people willingly move to small towns they immediately insert themselves into the local chatter to decry how their new home has "no culture"? No, Newcomer it doesn't have your big city commodities but rest assured...we have our own culture.

#inflation #markets #commodities #realassets
473 2018-05-11 16:41:13 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
474 2018-05-11 16:31:45 It's true. No commodities ever existed before capitalism.
475 2018-05-11 16:22:20 younger generations might flee into crypto but the old money will flee into concrete gold and other commodities. also a financial market crash like 2008 will put high pressure onto the underdevloped testnet shitcoins. imho BTC, ETH, LTC + privacy tokens might be the winners.
476 2018-05-11 16:17:34 not to mention a gov't that lets the NRA make the gun laws.. while children are considered disposable commodities at school.. Complex PTSD.. our "urban" youth have had to deal with it for decades.. now it is on the doorstep of white people too...
477 2018-05-11 16:09:37 Bit of luck then, with commodities hitting new highs?
478 2018-05-11 15:56:02 Yes difficult to calculate , trends more important as these anomalies tend to even out, the same way commodities seem to affect Headline Inflation ( as weightings don't change short run) even though they don't cause it

483 2018-05-11 15:28:20 No one buys products but everyone buys feelings. As the world becomes more complex & the commodities we buy more varied, the feelings we want become more urgent, less rational. How your business anticipates these feelings & satisfies them is your actual product or service.

599 2018-05-11 05:44:40 Singapore is part of the British Commonwealth. I didn’t know it has diplomatic ties with North Korea. Is Singapore also a money-laundromat for for trafficking weapons and other “commodities”?

603 2018-05-11 05:16:08 The so called good government has already lost its good name. Essential commodities must always be sold at reasonable prices. Politics is to relieve people of poverty but the GOOD GOVEFNMENT is impoverishing the indigent people.
604 2018-05-11 05:10:19 Discuss on major issues like growth in prices of daily commodities, lack of jobs, farmer suicide,lack of quality education etc not in this bullshit
605 2018-05-11 05:03:39 Many of our clients are expressing their commodity plays through options only. The 5 yr bear market in commodities may not be about duration as the quants say (never more than 5 yrs down) but maybe caused by this never before seen monetary situation, when that end so may demand

607 2018-05-11 04:34:39 Hay soluciones sencillas, hay que poner plazo perentorio para liquidar los dolares de la exportacion y retomar retenciones a las exportaciones de los commodities agrarias y a la mineria
608 2018-05-11 04:16:53 When Christopher Columbus wants to  buy  top-notch commodities he  always uses SugarChef-brand Brokers. They won't be beaten on price!
609 2018-05-11 03:56:04 And CONGRESS was bringing GST on a SINGLE RATE which was not good for consumers as WE as buyers ve to pay a SINGLE percentage of tax whether we buy a SAFETY PIN or an AIRBUS. IT WAS SAME ON ALL COMMODITIES. Aur koi 5% ya 6% GST lagate nahi. So think over this sir.
610 2018-05-11 03:45:31 What in the ever loving fuck that’s so wrong. Kids being treated as tools to get more money makes me so fucking mad like wtf they’re people not commodities
611 2018-05-11 03:31:53 The battle for local renovated infrastructure is not stopped by the people, it is stopped by the local government. Why can't we make changes. When can we rally for change that gives us the most precious of commodities, time, back to us. #MAGA #seattle #Traffic
612 2018-05-11 03:31:39 Como ya te dijeron, está haciendo exactamente lo mismo que hizo Cristina: pedirle "al campo" que venda la soja porque no hay dólares para seguir frenando una corrida cambiaria
Porque acá, desde siempre, lo único que trae divisas extranjeras son los commodities.

615 2018-05-11 03:11:53 Me da desconfianza los datos de inflación. Por un lado, disminuye la salida de emergentes al esperar una suba más lenta en las tasas pero a la vez sin inflación los commodities son menos atractivo.
616 2018-05-11 03:10:52 During my show introduction, Michael Oliver says the long term momentum structure has broken down for stocks, U.S. Treasuries and the dollar while gold and commodities are structurally in a bull market.  hhttps://tinyurl.com/y7rgj7nx
617 2018-05-11 03:09:33 Difference is that higher home prices specifically benefit local voters, because most property is owned locally, whereas higher prices in those other commodities typically benefit non-locals due to globalization.

620 2018-05-11 03:00:35 Agreed. Especially if “cash” is in the currency of U.S. Dollars! So many other opportunities in #fx #commodities #stocks and even fake #cryptos.
621 2018-05-11 02:50:55 Candidato @petrogustavo, respondame la siguiente duda por favor, ¿el cambio de modelo económico que propone de extracción de petróleo y carbón, por producción agroindustrial, pretende eliminar del todo la extracción de dichos commodities?
622 2018-05-11 02:29:52 Una vez que dolarizas es muy difícil echarla para atrás y en el mediano plazo nos restringirá y limitará nuestro crecimiento.
Perú no dolarizó y le va mucho mejor que a Ecuador, en especial en el ciclo de caída de precios de commodities
623 2018-05-11 02:25:35 E-National Agriculture Market (NAM), a pan-India e-trading platform has been launched to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. BJP has ensured that it does everything for farmers @BSYBJP #SarkaraBadalisiBJPGellisi
624 2018-05-11 02:24:43 I think stocks will have one last run up while commodities consolidate; after that, we’ll see correction in stocks and bullish commodities. #spx #commodities
625 2018-05-11 02:22:40 Nice! In April 2018, the co entered into a # of confidential MOU with 3rd party interested in listing commodities on the SX Market Place. Govt bodies in different jurisdictions have been approached to study the feasibility of deploying $SX blockchain-based market place
626 2018-05-11 02:14:53 Now, Marx was very clear about it in the discussion on the 'Fetishism of Commodities, in chapter 1 of Vol 1, that all ideologies and 'ideas' are second order relations to the relations of production. This idea is clearly laid out again in Volume 3. Read up.
627 2018-05-11 01:56:13 @25_male_nyc wen the boys from commodities hit the Hampton’s for the weekend
628 2018-05-11 01:26:08 And this is why I think it will be next summer, especially if we enter more never ending wars and the commodities markets cause mass chaos with oil and food prices.
629 2018-05-11 01:18:55 And one of the most abundant commodities on the internet today is confirmation bias. Plenty of videos of angry, inarticulate leftists acting as "proof".
630 2018-05-11 01:07:48 this transition into senior year, stressing about unemployment, drowning in debt is just a huge reminder that capitalism treats the proletariat as commodities, capitalism is dependent on exploitation and class antagonism

633 2018-05-11 00:41:40 Completely, gave me chills. Reminded me of a philosphical theory: "Superfluity" created specifically to explain the disorientation black people experience when the value of their lives and commodities become interchangeable for others' benefit.

636 2018-05-11 00:27:26 "if [speculators] who are playing zero-sum games on top of regular stocks and  commodities can be diverted into ***gold*** (and other pure early bird games like ponzis) instead, maybe that would make for a more ordered financial system" Can you not see this is the same argument?
637 2018-05-11 00:24:55 Terrible and horrible but we all know that due to rising conflicts and rising displacement of people this human trafficking has become a business where there is no value of human lives rather they are treated like commodities and abandoned when showing loss. Shame...
638 2018-05-11 00:24:30 But I agree with you on standardization of basic commodities .
639 2018-05-11 00:20:42 Yes tax free, but lot of commodities are up, inflation is high..edi ganun din wala nga sa income tax pero nasa mga binibili at serbisyo na inaavail mo naman..parang bumalik rin..
640 2018-05-11 00:18:53 Of course it’s not But most of our top 1% or high class has degrees and I think that’s a smart money move especially since many jobs are disposable commodities it’s even better to specialize in something cause you are not disposable

642 2018-05-11 00:13:11 Problem with increased income is that the cost of living also rises and the effect is not felt ...what’s needed is standardisation of basic commodities and services
643 2018-05-11 00:00:46 Why do so many ppl act like it’s rocket science to be effective at trading volatile commodities? Not like it takes decades to learn. It’s like any other complicated financial lbusiness concepts out. Its just applying principles and probabilities to values and calcing risk return
