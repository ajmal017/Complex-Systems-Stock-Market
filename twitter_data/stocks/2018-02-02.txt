58 2018-02-04 23:28:08 Not really. Cable business news is bunkum. They report how the markets did and make up a reason (despite that reason also happening on days the markets did the opposite). And they tout stocks you should buy with the same accuracy as random chance. She was just pretty.

70 2018-02-04 23:22:47 Good point. Here's an off the wall solution. Let's short tech stocks and work together to speed up the inevitable tech stock crash by only buying/using responsible products/services. Then when we have the money and the tech bros are broke we buy them one way tickets to anywhere.
71 2018-02-04 23:22:43 I also like to look at microcap biotech stocks I own.. they seem really sensitive to changes in market sentiment.. they are often the 1st to be sold off & also the 1st to rebought after a sell down

78 2018-02-04 23:13:33 This would be much more applicable to instances in normal stocks. Markets that move MUCH slower, and with much less volatility. Applying it to Alts not only looses you potential gains, but puts you at much higher risk due to lack of stability, and extreme volatility.

109 2018-02-04 23:00:03 Perhaps the general has huge investment in arms stocks.  Many of the people who advocate for war have stocks in the arms industry that they want them to skyrocket as soon as war starts.
110 2018-02-04 22:59:42 The assumption of DB's, is that every time stocks go down, bonds should rise because of being "safer than stocks". That works until the market decides bonds aren't safer. Especially sovereign bonds were historically considered not-so-safe (a status they will receive again).

This will get so large it will require military tribunals. Expect bonds, stocks, USD index plunge. Markets may stop & banks close too.
113 2018-02-04 22:57:46 Didn't Paul Krugman stupidly predict the market would collapse after Trump won the election ? Yes he did At least Warren Buffett bought back stocks he had sold prior to the election anticipating a Hillary win. Seems @forgefirst was in Paul's camp.

122 2018-02-04 22:49:08 No! They have it invested, most commonly in stocks etc or in property. Not things that increase consumption and thus contribute to economic growth. Very wealthy people, when given tax cuts do not tend to I crease consumption. That’s borne out of facts.

127 2018-02-04 22:42:31 Contrary to popular opinion. A bear market in stocks may coincide with a bear market in treasuries + dollar. Classic inflationary spiral problem.

Same period: #DowJones & #SP500 ≈210% growth! 

210% vs 3.5%; Why? 
1. Focus on #commodity #stocks in TSX; 
2. Debt-fueled bubbly growth of #CND #RealEstate 
3. Debt-fueled bubbly growth of US stocks!
134 2018-02-04 22:39:50 Yes Helen there isn't that much bad news around at all to cause any major sell off imo. If you sold or are shorting you're obviously happy to see and foster panic selling but I honestly don't see the need for that on the asx in general. Most quality stocks are opening flat atm.
135 2018-02-04 22:39:05 Google Dogs of the TSX. Easy 15% a year strategy to beat the general market and it includes high yield dividend stocks of reliable companies.
136 2018-02-04 22:38:59 Ya right. One lady got 1.50 hr increase now she’ll use that to pay for Costco membership. Stocks went down because were inflated but you’ll never tweet that will you. @marcorubio @SenBillNelson @RepRooney
137 2018-02-04 22:38:41 Hi. Yes, the Premier Store in Crossgates stocks and I have a stall at Woodlea stables every Saturday 10am-1pm.
138 2018-02-04 22:35:45 On @BloombergTV - Jermome Powell takes over the Fed amid a deepening bond rout; stocks set to fall in Asia; and we're live from the Singapore Airshow, speaking with the Qantas and IATA CEOs, plus many more
139 2018-02-04 22:35:40 You have a point and I thought hard about it.
ET and I have history. 
As I said, we are all accountable for our picks.
I just call out the orchestrated and vested interest ramping and rampers as I see them.
Collusion as it were to pump stocks.
Just recognising the results 
140 2018-02-04 22:34:28 Very good attacking play tonight! Great team effort, well taken goals from @Stocks_68 and @nucci39
141 2018-02-04 22:33:01 Thank you!

144 2018-02-04 22:30:17 Sure. Cherry pick a 30 day period to make your comparison. Do you stocks have property taxes and a leaky roof too?

146 2018-02-04 22:29:23 The lad on the right looks like the type of fella who'd sell stocks of a fake milk company to an 89-year-old in exchange for their pension.
147 2018-02-04 22:27:23 If people cant adapt to changing market conditions and sit there praying stocks run back up.

They should not be playing penny stocks.

Not many companies make it.. so the more you hold "long". More chance you are going to get burned

#1 rule - never fall in love with a stock
148 2018-02-04 22:26:49 Great game from Carlo, stocks set up all 3 of his goals and scored 1 himself, and his all round gameplay was great too! Brilliant game from both of three
149 2018-02-04 22:26:24 As I say...would love it! Too much money as well. Fucking Warnock...when will he retire
150 2018-02-04 22:25:32 Congratulations, he’s gorgeous 
151 2018-02-04 22:25:00 Last week's 117.5 point (-4.1%) fall was the biggest weekly drop seen in S&P Futures since 8 January 2016, 108 weeks earlier #stocks
152 2018-02-04 22:25:00 S&P Futures have broken the previous day's low for 4 days in a row. The run has extended to 5 days only once in the 594 sessions since 24 September 2015, the exception coming on 9 March 2017, 229 trading days ago #stocks
153 2018-02-04 22:24:00 Where is the tweet about the fall in stocks by 666 points?
154 2018-02-04 22:23:48 Aussie shares set for a tumble on open. #SPI -65pts or -1.07% after US stocks fell by 2.5% on Friday (worst day ~8-months) due to bigger than expected lift in US wages #ausbiz
155 2018-02-04 22:23:08 Have you heard of belt loops? Rubber bands? Pieces of string? Practice?
All of which can achieve the same affect as bump stocks. Shall we ban them all?

157 2018-02-04 22:22:17 I am not connected to this stock I am not compensated and do not work for any stocks that I pick. I also do not front load any of them either. All my past picks have gone up much higher stayed way above my Alert price none dropped lower or below all still much higher!
158 2018-02-04 22:22:05 I held a few stocks for 8 months that a recently sold. I was long term since last week.

I could double my positions in both already with same money.. but probably could get even more in upcomming weeks.

Is staying long very that much better? Id say i made the right moves for me
159 2018-02-04 22:21:36 Another incredible evening of new talent & writing. Such an amazing range & views on the subject of Class. Thank you to our lovely host @suzy_gill & thank you to our incredible industry panel @Rosie_Bennett_ @marcusellard @jonbrittain & @mixingnetworks for your feedback.
160 2018-02-04 22:20:43 ?
161 2018-02-04 22:20:09 Fantastic 2nd and 3rd period play from the @FifeFlyers tonight. Great displays from @nucci39 & @Stocks_68 tonight. Well deserved victory. Special shout out to @dotes_28 who took the banter from the Fife fans well at the end.

164 2018-02-04 22:17:57 That's kinda my point. Every company needs to promote in some way. Social media is just another ave. To your point of $FAT & $IME being fundamentally solid companies it still won't keep traders from attempting PD. All stocks are vulnerable imo.

168 2018-02-04 22:16:22 No prem jobs available. Would have to go back abroad otherwise. I think it would be a great move for both parties. 
Could always go back for Warnock!
169 2018-02-04 22:15:11 Surely he’d have bigger plans that the Leeds job? Would love him tho
170 2018-02-04 22:15:10 I do that as well
 Hard to sell out of everthing. Easy to hedge. Also allows stocks to become long term.
171 2018-02-04 22:14:56 In celebration
172 2018-02-04 22:14:36 Do you prefer braised stocks or fried? Or boiled stocks a la Mnuchin? Tough choice!

181 2018-02-04 22:10:00 The Dow has posted a daily trading range of more than 1.0% for 3 days in a row. The run last extended to 4 days on 10 November 2016, 309 trading days ago #stocks
182 2018-02-04 22:10:00 Friday's 666 point (-2.5%) fall was the biggest drop seen in the Dow since Friday 24 June 2016 #stocks

186 2018-02-04 22:06:48 The grants will be the key, and I am sure I know where he applied as well, other stocks I follow have applied for the same grants, and the SP took off once the market became aware. $amy is 2018 watcher, no question, I have lots of shares, but it needs a bit more time yet.

197 2018-02-04 21:59:22 Democrat here...I probably own more guns than you. We are not anti-gun, we are against idiots having easy access to guns and see no need for hi-capacity mags and bump stocks. We believe that the NRA should go back to its roots and promote gun safety instead of gun sales.
198 2018-02-04 21:58:08 Everyone says a drop in $BTC won't affect the stock market, but if the fast money players lose enough money, they could sell some momentum stocks also. Likely the same group of players. I would guess total mkt cap of all coins is down $400B from highs.
199 2018-02-04 21:56:00 Definitely deserved MoM tonight congrats @Stocks_68

207 2018-02-04 21:49:00 Good day and good night . Market will turn eventually. That's all what matters. Although some stocks may never recoup maybe do because they are not as they say  who they are. But some good deals out there imho
208 2018-02-04 21:48:13 Wouldn't count that 401k increase just yet, unless you've already sold your stocks. Market always returns to value, no matter how much the head cheerleader (M I A Lately) tries to pretend he creates value.
209 2018-02-04 21:47:04 @adhia03 sir u said u want to keep all asset class similar than why LTCG on real estate is NIL after 2 years & no such benefit in stocks ? Even if we sell after 5 years we have to pay 10% why ? It’s that unfair.? Even though real estate is CASH driven markets sir @porinju agree?
210 2018-02-04 21:46:54 That's simply a failure to adhere to your strategy.

The people you describe are the same ones who used to buy individual stocks through brokers. They also reacted emotionally and withdrew all their $$ in the past, they just paid more in commissions for the privilege.
211 2018-02-04 21:45:45 You have been touting on stocks whole year. Got comments on recent developments?
212 2018-02-04 21:45:41 It's more "Let's make regular people know our name so we can use this to increase our stocks prices" huahuahua
213 2018-02-04 21:45:15 Maybe so, but crypto exchanges are nearly identical to brokerages like e-trade and fidelity. Also, stocks can lose/gain value just like crypto. Banks only want to protect themselves from potential losses. Lastly, it isn’t your $ when u use cc.
214 2018-02-04 21:44:09 This is $FATs time to shine.  All the money that was being dumped into mj stocks needs a new home 
215 2018-02-04 21:44:01 Evidence when an economy is relatively stable somewhere between 12-18months. Initially demand increase creates a run down of stocks and then prices start rising, costs then rise and any temporary increase in output contracts.
216 2018-02-04 21:43:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer

223 2018-02-04 21:39:29 Interesting fact I read on Friday night after big $DIA fall (unfortunately lost reference) that the Dow would have had a +ve close if $GE was replaced by $AMZN b'cos it only has ~30 stocks in it.

226 2018-02-04 21:36:12 Dow's worst week in two years, 4:26 PM, Americans are finding more jobs and wages are surging. But that's not exactly a great thing for Wall Street. Here's why stocks tanked last week.

232 2018-02-04 21:32:22 African American unemployment spiked after you claimed the opposite. Stocks tanked after you claimed responsibility. US debt will skyrocket because of your tax heist. Are you tired of losing yet?

235 2018-02-04 21:30:31 Posting that over and over doesn’t change the fact that you don’t know what you’re arguing. 

It wasn’t a physical deal. It was stocks. The company is Canadian. Hillary didn’t even vote on it. JFC. Stop telling others to do research when you haven’t done your own.
236 2018-02-04 21:30:17 HNA Capital is a shell company for the Chinese state but USA govt and investors must be coy about that fact since China owns big share of our debt bonds stocks and real estate and is our lender

The rest I'd buy a diverse port of large cap stocks & HODL.

263 2018-02-04 21:18:40 It’s called a cash advance, and you can use any atm to do that. Not just at casinos. Can’t buy stocks w/ cc so logically shouldn’t be able to do the same with crypto.

361 2018-02-04 20:05:17 #Stocks,#Indexes Note our definition of a bear market: whatever follows a major top signal. But SPX declines of 10%, more frequently 20% or more, have followed signals similar to that of 01.29.2018. Duration? Variation not obviously correlated with any signal features.

367 2018-02-04 20:02:06 The school secretary had the right idea-upgrade to Costco Gold Membership & pocket the 2% rewards check + the $20 cash card.

387 2018-02-04 19:54:36 Of course - just pointing out that stocks of even good businesses can also take on limited Ponzi like (money in is money out) characteristics to a very small degree when valuations are extremely high only.
388 2018-02-04 19:53:35 My biggest trades of my life typically come from major capitulation on daily time frames and intraday time frames on stocks and cryptos that just made a major bullish move.

401 2018-02-04 19:45:27 And under B Hussein Obama, he had the Fed Reserve print 3 TRILLION DOLLARS to buy stocks to pump up the markets.  It was a FAKE economy. Meanwhile the workers lost wages and wealth. Research it!!!

435 2018-02-04 19:34:00 It's already been released, and it served it's purpose. BTW, before you bring up the stock market. It wasn't crashing. That was just investors switching their stocks and bonds. This usually happens when the interest rates change. The also buy/sell based on what benefits them.
436 2018-02-04 19:33:35 pretty funny when liberals were taking their money out of stocks scared that policies Trump took might ruin the economy but now it's gone up, now it's Obama doing, when Obama said it was impossible to do a 3 percent rise. if the economy failed you'll be blaming Trump

452 2018-02-04 19:24:10 Stocks crashed a prophetic 666 points! Wasn't Trump the guy who said a reporter should be fired over a story (quickly corrected) that caused a dip in the market? I believe a "crash" Trumps a "dip" any day. Trump should take his own advice and resign.

459 2018-02-04 19:20:32 This is very fair. I think what this piece probably shows are people that claimed to want "a really good investment, like Tech stocks or housing" , and actually wanted to get pretty rich fast and easily.

517 2018-02-04 18:50:15 The two-year Treasury yield recently surpassed the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time since before the crisis. As that gap widens, the incentive to own bonds instead of stocks grows.

529 2018-02-04 18:42:26 The Conference Board reported that Americans are now more bullish on stocks than they have been since January 2000 – notwithstanding friday’s 666-point drop (-2.54%) on the Dow.
530 2018-02-04 18:42:23 I agree. This about the time all the attention turned to stockowners and stocks, when all the “Greed is Good” type movies were made, lifestyle of enormous wealth was displayed as being the ultimate example of for what to aspire.

535 2018-02-04 18:39:53 By that logic, one should then specifically look for stocks which didn’t get a memo about the correction in the market. Woh toh phir best quality huae na 
If a high quality corrects as much, then either it was priced for perfection, or story seems to be changing

538 2018-02-04 18:38:32 So as part of an international agreement (not EU) Britain and other nations agreed to restrict trawling so stocks could recover. Our choice: restrict fishing and save some of the industry, or keep going and destroy it. 

Nothing - absolutely nothing - to do with the EU 3/

540 2018-02-04 18:37:08 Neither do they remember the run-up to October 24, 1929. The brain trust happy w/ a 10% loss on a 40% gain should read a book. Anyone who thinks we need a definition of inflation shld look up over-valued stocks & the impact of trillion dollar deficits.
541 2018-02-04 18:37:05 Some parts of our waters were stripped bare by drag trawling 4 times a year, and our stocks were unviable - no fish growing old enough to be worth catching 2/
542 2018-02-04 18:36:11 I can't tell if he was just trolling or if he actually thinks digital currencies are a form of "stocks". Either way when reading something like that, the "Do your own  research" comes to mind.
543 2018-02-04 18:35:59 Do these same institutions allow you to buy stocks/bonds/commodities on their credit cards? (Serious q - I don’t know the answer)
544 2018-02-04 18:35:57 For example, CP lived in Moscow, learned Russian, worked for an Energy consultant and wanted to make a lot of money. Met with Russian spies (possibly unbeknownst) and was allegedly offered 19% stocks in an energy company which did sell but money unaccounted for. See easy target.
545 2018-02-04 18:34:37 Quit calling my social security an entitlement, it is not that at all it is my money from my pay check that helps with my retirement.
I don't want that money going to Wall Street and gambled on in stocks. Why do you hate the 99% so much?  @SpeakerRyan

547 2018-02-04 18:32:38 One added item: If Goldman call is right and it occurs in summer, something more may be lurking: an outright bear. A market top takes months, which sideways action would produce. Then, in the historically vulnerable May to Nov. period, stocks break. We shall see. 
548 2018-02-04 18:32:00 Inertia, complacency, ignorance? Just like most people keep owning high fees mutual funds and poorly performing stocks
549 2018-02-04 18:30:06 Doesn't really matter as the country has drifted far left. Even Bill Clinton was as conservative as Trump is now. In his second term maybe more so  Leftist, socialist policies don't work and are horrible for stocks.  The Trump derangement syndrome interferes with simple logic
550 2018-02-04 18:29:38 @JCLayfield Have had a 401(k) since 2009, now thinking about actually actively trading stocks, bonds, & mutual funds. What's the best website in your opinion to use? #makingabullrun
551 2018-02-04 18:29:21 Not necessarily record breaking. e.g. Feb. -8%, Mar. flat to up, then Apr. is down enough to get you to -10%+. The problem is Mar. and Apr. tend to be up months: 65% and 69% of the time. Also, we are still in the Nov. to Apr. favorable period for stocks. Goldman call? In summer.

568 2018-02-04 18:13:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia

How does it feel losing stocks at 50 because of docs fair 
574 2018-02-04 18:11:17 As a businessman at the time it's his right to do that however when your wife is secretary of state is it ethical to receive half a million dollars for a speech in Russia?

578 2018-02-04 18:07:15 I think he is one contributor... But I think it will likely crash while he is president though... Unless we make some major changes beyond already... Did not vote for him but SOME of his moves have been brilliant for stocks and jobs

580 2018-02-04 18:06:33 Does Friday's 666 point drop in the Dow make you think we could get a crash like Black Monday? Barron's points out the 30-year Treasury bond was over 10% in October 1987, the month Black Monday occured. This provided "formidable competition" to stocks. The 30-year is just 3% now.

600 2018-02-04 17:55:53 I was being sarcastic. Stocks boomed when Trump was elected and it was because of Trump and not despite. Krugman predicted immediate stock collapse upon Trump election. Instead, they've boomed to highest ever, notwishstanding recent correction.

607 2018-02-04 17:50:43 We are in short term correction but in bull market first correction is always a buy..... Fibonacci retrachment can take us to 10600 or 10450...which should be utilised to buy good stocks
608 2018-02-04 17:49:40 Billions stolen!!! Kakest excuse ever "Unable to communicate while stocks are under cautionary notice" people need answers #CarteBlanche
609 2018-02-04 17:49:28 A little over my head especially the QE part. Are investors dumping stocks because economic conditions are finally forcing companies to pay higher wages?
610 2018-02-04 17:48:49 Don’t forget that the economy is not the stockmarket. Less than 45% of Americans own stock and the top 20% of Americans own 92% of all stocks. So the stockmarket doesn’t give wealth to the bottom 80%. They still struggle. The inequality is criminal in the US.
611 2018-02-04 17:45:54 So that is the leaders of the democratic party a bunch of 1/2 educated nitwits whose main goal in life is to tell stupid jokes what does that say about Democratic Leadership in this day and age... and then you wonder why you lose elections..#SuperBowl #stocks #news

619 2018-02-04 17:40:51 Kim I hope your stock portfolio is well invested stocks raise for for two reasons.  One is on the back of sound finances the other is a bubble.  Bubbles unfortunately have a tendency to go pop in the most spectacular fashion !

621 2018-02-04 17:39:34 That absolutely makes no sense, the same can be said about stocks or anykind of investment because u r treating it as an investment instrument. The governments opposition for it is as a currency for exchange and my question is fundamental Around principles and not examples

626 2018-02-04 17:36:35 he was also saying real estate was a bad investment too! guys a realtor WOW must have been using it as cover to promote and pump the stocks

628 2018-02-04 17:33:10 In UK, possibly the case before 1997/2001, was referred to as the "old boy network". But since 2001 and Mass Migration, certainly not the case any more. Look at profile and backgrounds of MPs. As for USA, Central Bankers are restricted from Trading on Stocks & Bonds.
629 2018-02-04 17:33:07 Stocks will drop under Trump anyway so it would only be a self serving prophecy
630 2018-02-04 17:32:29 Crash? It's investors taking profits. These dips allow other investors,a chance at lower priced stocks. Go away joey s. Your opinion belongs at the bottom of the swamp.

633 2018-02-04 17:31:50 Here is why I disagree. When stocks continue to fall, Trump is going to make it worse by causing uncertainty which will spook investors. I believe in the short term it will dip to 23,000 - 24,000. By next year we could be as low as 20,000.

641 2018-02-04 17:25:23 There’s one systematic process in crypto- mining. The rest is emotional and hypothetical/perceived value. Equities have multiple systematic schemes (defined investment plans, stock repurchase plans, fundamentals), so it is a structured market. Crypto still has a ton of upside.
642 2018-02-04 17:24:57 There's so much hype about multiples, valuations, PEs etc in investments. It's essentially just guessing. Instead of guessing, buy quality stocks trading at historic averages (fairly priced) that have a good divi track record... so simple

652 2018-02-04 17:20:55 Yes & it’s funny that this week when the MEMO WAS COMING OUT the stocks tumbled a bit & MSM was blaming TRUMP not the fact the world lost faith in our gov due to corruption of highest tier in FBI & implicates Obama Admin & Hillary. 
653 2018-02-04 17:20:46 Good Superbowl morning. I have to admit the I admire the work ethic of both teams. They are both going after a goal. Many of us are also chasing a dream. I am chasing a dream of earning a Ph.D. in finance. Good luck to everyone chasing a dream. Dreams can come true.

656 2018-02-04 17:19:06 If you use money you dont have to buy any investment you are a moron.  Crypto, stocks, bonds...whatever.

659 2018-02-04 17:17:01 Trump himself, allegedly was offered up to a 19 percent stake in Rosneft, Russia’s  oil company, in return for his lifting the sanctions imposed on Russia by Pres. Obama. Subsequently, stocks of Rosneft were transfer to a partnership  owned by a shadowy Corp in the Cayman Islands
660 2018-02-04 17:17:01 Yes, no LTCG for stocks sold prior to 31 Mar, as budget proposals applies for next financial year.
661 2018-02-04 17:16:29 The market has had a great run over the last 8 years. It’s earnings. But tax reform redistributes wealth from people to companies. The market is reflecting this reality.  So it it good for stocks to give owners more profit.
662 2018-02-04 17:16:17 Looking keenly for more correction in market to get better entry points. Let's see if I m lucky to get my stocks at my desired price.
663 2018-02-04 17:15:31 And that's assuming we don't enter a bear market overall...huge selloff in stocks last week. Could theoretically go even lower than that.

665 2018-02-04 17:14:59 A shoutout to NBS Galleria for having dusty stocks of Anvil books. I hate you. Jk.

Panatilihin po nating malinis ang ating kapaligiran + books. 
666 2018-02-04 17:14:37 Stocks give approx. say 15% return. To earn more than 1 lac LTCG, you need 6 lacs of investment in stock markets. At 5% , this family has investments of Rs.1.2 cr. As per your logic. And you are worried about their 2 meals.
667 2018-02-04 17:14:06 Why is it that there is a certain trigger level for correlation changes anyway? Shouldn't every tiny rate increase be priced into stocks as lower discounted present value?
668 2018-02-04 17:13:47 Seems like causal chain has been flight to quality when stocks went down so negative correlation. This latest driven by interest rates rising causing repricing pv of future corporate earnings flows--so positive correlation.

671 2018-02-04 17:13:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your insomnia
672 2018-02-04 17:12:19 #ElonMusk #boring how soon can you make boring company public? My accountant thinks I should invest in more boring stocks than Tesla!
673 2018-02-04 17:10:46 No, it doesn't. 

It was investors skimming profits, tanking stocks, and then buying them back at lower prices.

They were waiting for the #memo to do this on 'market jitters'.

677 2018-02-04 17:09:47 When everyone else is selling you buy. Old investing rule. #hobbies2 #sparetime #lagniappe #stocks #money All my comments are opinion based.
678 2018-02-04 17:08:40 Exactly! 

So many company stocks I tried moving in and out of to avoid draw downs. In retrospect, I would have been so much better off just buying and holding through thick and thin. 

Trading consumes capital.

680 2018-02-04 17:06:48 Fed can tighten as long as USD falling & US stocks rising.  Fail on either of those counts (let alone both) & IMO we'll see the Fed fold quite rapidly
681 2018-02-04 17:06:32 They want to see which way the stocks would gain profits .
682 2018-02-04 17:05:50 Who care about the pumper when you do your own dd and follow the right path. I chose my stocks base on good news that will bring light to a company.
683 2018-02-04 17:05:50 Excellent article Josh, thx for the post!  Interesting, why most see such events negatively, in reality as Cramer says “great stocks are on sale” see it as an opportunity!
684 2018-02-04 17:05:11 Those are the lines on the screen...and for real money. "When rates go up stocks down...just wait 3 months" is what often shows up in textbooks.
685 2018-02-04 17:04:40 I'm sure you have stocks in some of those companies but yet I don't her you complain about the amount of money you are adding to your portfolio.... isn't it time for you democrats to grow up?

696 2018-02-04 16:59:44 The Dow Jones stocks took a 666 point big hit, yesterday.  Political Turmoil is probably one reason for the sharpest Dow Jones decline in years
697 2018-02-04 16:58:56 The FED and the fed. gov will make sure the stock market goes up in the long run, but they don't care about cryptos. Cryptos fall, nobody in gov. cares. Stocks fall=massive stimulus
698 2018-02-04 16:57:09 Heads really be out here trading stocks without even knowing how to do it. Just to try to say they doing something with there life lmao
699 2018-02-04 16:56:00 You know what exacerbated the market sell off? Moron #bitcoin hedge funds had to sell stocks to fend off margin calls and losses.
700 2018-02-04 16:54:36 We are at the beginning stages of seeing how #cryptocurrency will create value. That’s why the market is volatile. It’s also why the possibilities are endless. Naysayers sound like people on the late 1800s and early 1900s who thought stocks were a scam.
701 2018-02-04 16:54:18 It's all about owning in getting stocks
702 2018-02-04 16:53:47 Luke, why do you think Fed more likely to walk back rate hike expectations than ECB?  EUR strength and relative underperformance of European stocks suggests fears of tightening too fast coming from EZ and not U.S.  - Draghi’s comments last month suggest same.
703 2018-02-04 16:53:28 Just like it does with any stocks in the stock market. It will go up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and...
704 2018-02-04 16:53:26 But Stephen Paddock did not use illegally purchased weapons.
They were legal semiautomatic rifles, fitted with legal bump stocks.

Murder is already illegal. 

We have made it legal to buy tools that enable one person to murder more than 50 people in a single incident.
705 2018-02-04 16:53:13 On Friday, stocks tumbled by more than 2 percent, propelling the market to its worst week in two years.  Yet not a peep from any of you. You tout all the successes, never giving credit to @BarackObama, and go dark when shit goes the opposite direction. Hypocrisy.
706 2018-02-04 16:51:29 Your stupidity is shining brightly. Do your DD and learn about stocks so you don't look so dumb when posting on Twitter.

720 2018-02-04 16:37:21 The scams started decades ago with the "penny stocks" have found an echo today in the #crypto-world through groups of Telegram, where hundreds of thousands are organized to practice the "pump and dump".
Technology or the market can change, the human being is always the same...
721 2018-02-04 16:36:00 Pre-crisis, when the @federalreserve had monetary policy in a neutral to tight stance, this correlation was closer to zero, and in the 1990s stocks and bonds often moved together, as growth shocks often led to inflation.
722 2018-02-04 16:35:53 And i think 2018 is the death of one and begining of another cycle great time to buy in while its super low or at price when it bottoms out. I have as they say real stocks to and the markets are not the same. Can't really compare the same way.
723 2018-02-04 16:33:28 Little putz blocked me just cuz I liked a tweet that called him out.  I didn't even comment, just "liked" it!  I only followed him to watch his arrogant little pumping ass get smoked by this market and the shit stocks he pumps to his minions.

731 2018-02-04 16:28:56 Twitter has no incentive to kick off trump. He bought Twitter stocks & made a deal to up it if he were to win the elections. Each trump's tweet puts money in their pockets.  His lies & incendiary tweets generate more traffic, hence more money.
What if we all ignore his tweets..

740 2018-02-04 16:23:44 Government lowers taxes, which reduces tax revenue. They gonna increase the interest rates on government bonds, consequentially, lowers the demand for stocks
741 2018-02-04 16:23:23 Agree. But banning credit cards is a good thing long term. You can’t buy stocks equities futures or options on a credit card. Why btc ?
742 2018-02-04 16:23:03 You know what will be even better? Tokenized stocks!
743 2018-02-04 16:22:24 If I understand the value of polls, Mueller, the travesty of Nunes, the proclaimed idiocy of Republicans at large it is understandable that as "leader" potus should be tarred & feathered and locked in stocks on the sidewalk in front of the White house. Ryan as well! Criminals!
744 2018-02-04 16:21:08 How about visiting Kimberly-Clark, AT&T, Carrier, Sam’s Club — companies that, due to the tax scam, are buying back their stocks, closing stores and laying off their workers?  Dopey Delusional Donny is a DISASTER!

770 2018-02-04 16:06:03 The economy  has been growing, since Obama,  thanks to the tax bill the rich will get richer. I.e.

772 2018-02-04 16:04:16 Yah, it does do damage, if you are careless enough to invest without knowledge of how the system works and not investigating the companies... But you can choose not to invest your money. Problem solved - just don't invest in stocks.

792 2018-02-04 15:58:31 And the stocks went down just now.
793 2018-02-04 15:57:02 Resigned following the exposure of her purchase of tobacco stocks.
794 2018-02-04 15:57:01 90% of Americans don’t own stocks.
795 2018-02-04 15:56:48 Suppose you have $1M in multiple stocks and latter see it drops to $300K (70% down) due to a big bear market, but you know its intrinsic value is still above $1M, will you get happier and excited, or upset? Or both?
796 2018-02-04 15:55:13 President Dwight Eisenhower's exit speech on January 17, 1961 was a warning: "Beware of the Military Industrial Complex."

For the GOP that meant, circle the wagons, invest heavily (stocks) and promote war everyday.
797 2018-02-04 15:54:58 cant blame me anymore
798 2018-02-04 15:53:18 It would be interesting to rank stocks based on how many etf's they are found in and compare performance. ETF's might be the only thing holding up this market atm #passiveinvesting -> #activepanic
799 2018-02-04 15:51:08 Think about it people don’t usually buy stocks with their credit cards
800 2018-02-04 15:51:06 Today's paper, German Co taking 60,000tons of herring from UK waters, all goes abroad. We catch, we process, we sell. And manage stocks better, win/win
801 2018-02-04 15:49:54 Stocks have been in a bull market for 8 years, 8 years of stocks going up without a drop of 20% or more. The average lifespan of a bull market is approximately 47 months. I predict a crash is coming this year.
802 2018-02-04 15:49:32 Home Depot says it's giving employees $1000 bonus. What they do not say, it's for workers with eyes with company. Avg. is 3 years in retail. Also, they are using tax cuts by back stocks, for shareholders.
803 2018-02-04 15:49:30 I should buy stocks in febreze! gonna be an interesting few years! lol
804 2018-02-04 15:49:04 whats with the limited stocks they obv knew things were gonna sell out urghhfj
805 2018-02-04 15:48:11 Wow the stock market drops to 666? Interesting. #stocks
806 2018-02-04 15:47:00 In my opinion every trader should learn not to predict but to react the best way possible to every price movement. You cant be right every time you predict, but you can react in the best way every time. #StockMarket #stocks #discipline #SundayMorning
807 2018-02-04 15:46:37 First stocks get shaky because they’re built on “buy backs” and greedy deregulation. Deficit claims our budget and inflation hits working families in the gut. Russia wins and Stupid loses!
808 2018-02-04 15:44:50 In early 2016 we had a real bear market that wasn’t termed as one because $SPY was never down more than 15% or so despite many stocks and even whole sectors down 40%
809 2018-02-04 15:42:55 They say the only way to be great at something is to be obsessed with it .. I swear I think about stocks n crypto 24/7
810 2018-02-04 15:42:48 They were looking at weed stocks and crypto last month. That’s the sell sign.
811 2018-02-04 15:42:04 Am interested in acquiring deep knowledge of the forex market and stocks... I will be glad if you carry me along
812 2018-02-04 15:41:02 In this way please name 5 or 6 stocks to invest
813 2018-02-04 15:40:07 Bracing for impact tomorrow. Thinking that Cdn stocks might recovery quickly if our dollar drops significantly agains the US$. I believe our strong $ has been a main factor in tsx mid term weakness.
814 2018-02-04 15:40:03 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
815 2018-02-04 15:39:42 Are you fucking kidding me??  With every market in the world taking a beating for the past week and a half, and all the Canadian Cannabis stocks taking a bigger beating, you want to call out one CEO, for a lower stock price! MAN,, are you in the wrong game! Go back to monopoly!
816 2018-02-04 15:38:54 Until now the pullback is ok. IMO lots of stocks get back to supports. Of course here "supports" mean a line I draw on the charts. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they dont. We will see.

819 2018-02-04 15:37:01 But what are these values based on? Stocks values are based on revenue and earnings. I just can never find any substance to these prices except a theory or supply and demand.
820 2018-02-04 15:36:33 Not when including State Subsidies (China), cost of destruction at eol, and comparison to weight per BTUS.

Only cost effective scheme I know is Brazilian soybeans.  But that pushes up price of global food-stocks, which the EU doesn't help by keeping its GMO ban w/ no evidence.
821 2018-02-04 15:36:05 Don’t ignore the fact that the tax cut is skewed HEAVILY towards rich people most of whom own lots of stocks and further benefits from stock earnings due to tax cuts. You’re probably one of them.
822 2018-02-04 15:35:33 Investing in stocks is the new wave because 401k, social security, and retirement is dwindling away

849 2018-02-04 15:31:21 It will be a great lesson! IMO you should also talk about hedging (with Gold/Silver, VC crypto like @Genevieve_VC, stocks...)
850 2018-02-04 15:30:43 Stocks might still crash though... But I wouldn't blame solely Trump...
851 2018-02-04 15:30:26 That Ameritrade ad with Lionel Ritchie is essentially rich white folks talking about stocks with a black servant. A bit tone deaf, yes?

853 2018-02-04 15:28:32 I want to learn how to invest in stocks
854 2018-02-04 15:26:22 @KicksDealsCA I’ve been hearing Rumours that Canada is sharing stocks with Europe for the OW Jordan 1, is that true?
855 2018-02-04 15:24:52 I’ll argue some stocks will trade at 52-w lows but never again trade at or anywhere near AT low. Ex. $WEED. Are you only a buyer of the biggest public LP in Canada when it trades <$2.00? That mindset is good way to miss out on runs. IMHO need to consider all prices & time frames
856 2018-02-04 15:24:08 How about those stocks Donnie?
857 2018-02-04 15:23:44 Replenished the lamps Angela Stocks due to a shortage in the cupboard
858 2018-02-04 15:23:23 Pain ahead for equities but on technicals, the fundamental view on earnings is bullish enough to see positive year for stocks
859 2018-02-04 15:22:37 Did the stocks up or down?
860 2018-02-04 15:22:31 Great read for students entering college, for investors studying stocks, for entrepreneurs considering one of these fields.

866 2018-02-04 15:21:45 Berlusconi only cares of his business, as usual. In 2011 he decided to resign just cause international investors were making his Mediaset chips dance on a rollercoaster in the stocks exchange. He learnt the lesson, so he will never oppose anymore that system. He HAS to be pro-EU.

870 2018-02-04 15:17:28 Lol. This type of thinking would prevent you from buying great stocks that experience dips. If “what was” has no correlation to “what could be” then just hold cash in your acct and don’t ever buy anything when a sector pulls back
871 2018-02-04 15:16:29 Ben Youngs injury looks nasty. Driven off on a stretcher. If his tournament is over, England's scrum half stocks will be tested. It is one area in which Eddie Jones has not yet developed a third option.

877 2018-02-04 15:11:43 Hasn't affected me, my two jobs pay barely enough to keep my farm running. Every dollar goes to elect/fuel these days. Can't afford stocks. Ironically, Trump does well in this mkt climate though.

885 2018-02-04 15:05:24 OMG yes it has been like that since, I hope they decide to buy soon since stocks are running pretty low!

887 2018-02-04 15:04:34 The downturn in stocks took them back to where they were 3 weeks ago, and so is not a major concern.
888 2018-02-04 15:03:02 The most truth being spoken on twitter about stocks on the Jse are from guys with pseudo name accounts , everyone else ends up being threatened in one or other way .
889 2018-02-04 15:02:53 Islamic people should not invest/trade in stocks if they believe in sharia. Hypocrities.
890 2018-02-04 15:01:33 Every time I get the urge to do something stupid with my money I invest more in stocks I know and that pay dividends. I love getting dividends from companies I do business with. People, be patient and build over time. Time is powerful.
891 2018-02-04 15:00:35 To open a brokerage account, you'll have to put up cash. Although a margin account will allow you to trade with borrowed money, buying stocks with a credit card normally isn't an option: Most brokers and online trading firms won't allow it.
892 2018-02-04 15:00:00 Dear @dmuthuk Sir, have been following you recently on Twitter must say you inspire so many small & 1st time Investor in right way.
I have query,  when is the right time to Average Stocks? (With respect to recent correction post 2018 budget)
Pls do reply Sir.
893 2018-02-04 14:59:52 What banks let people buy Stocks with credit Cards? Same thing. If I ran Credit at a big bank I wouldn't let people buy Risk assets with a Credit Card. And I love #Bitcoin. this is a foolish comment.

900 2018-02-04 14:55:00 So when is a good time?  Last year bitcoin went ballistic, EVERYONE talked about crytpo/blockchain yet John did absolutely nothing.  Now when I see companies PR and talk about it stocks barely move.  That PR we just had said blockchain 4 times and stock was red on the day....
901 2018-02-04 14:54:26 - with a a much funnier fact that 70% of them do not hold stocks for more than 3.5 months...
902 2018-02-04 14:53:02 It's not going away any time soon. Just very volatile. I'm mostly cash re stocks. Mkt looks awful. Can always re-establish positions.

910 2018-02-04 14:45:45 After pocketing a $5 billion tax cut from the GOP Tax Scam, Pfizer decided to end all of its Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. Then they did exactly as it was predicted, they fired 300 scientists and used that money to buy back their stocks.
911 2018-02-04 14:45:36 Can't really go wrong but prefer 3,000 stocks over 500
912 2018-02-04 14:45:14 Selling my stocks last week was the best decision I ever made.
913 2018-02-04 14:44:54 Not to mention NY looking at regulating Crypto like stocks & bonds, along with Canada + all of Davos
914 2018-02-04 14:43:11 Something always comes out on top, but what will it be?

The #crypto market cap fell from 833b to 423b in less than 30 days.  
#Gold and #silver are steady at $1,330 and $16.55.

915 2018-02-04 14:41:28 Ever since Reagan, wages at the bottom flatlined and exec compensation and stocks soared. This is more of the same.
916 2018-02-04 14:40:49 Okay that is bullcrap. Both shows NEVER were laughing stocks in animation. If that is the case then why are people still like watching them. Why do you keep complaining about things that aren't even a problem at all.

923 2018-02-04 14:33:41 Many people advised you this is bull market correction. But you know if index gone 1000 point then stocks goes down 30-50%. In my ways small investor and short term investor stay away even also from defensive sector. Just view not a recommendation. Do whatever you want to do.
924 2018-02-04 14:33:02 They still think of old term "Satta Bazar" and have no idea how much analysis is required before entering or exiting stocks. Plz explain them stocks are not gamble sir
925 2018-02-04 14:31:52 Stocks is taking it easy as just back from injury, I’d say Heelis has had monkey on his back for the last 5games, dunno if he’s injured or just going through a rough patch, he needs a couple goals to get back in the groove.
926 2018-02-04 14:31:19 Anyone looking at any standard models will tell you that Indian market is highly overvalued. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the headline growth forecasts.

Since you say Stock market gains don’t require any efforts, pls invest all Govt money in Stocks & let it grow effortlessly.

934 2018-02-04 14:25:46 My thoughts on MJ. Legalized . Now,just the beginning. After legalization, companies start showing massive earnings, stocks will rise enormously. Stop worrying about now.Stick to established LPs,2yrs from now,bank acc will prove you were right.& 4 now.OTC Manipulation.

936 2018-02-04 14:23:33 Stock are 83% owned by the wealthy. They rose because the wealthy bought back their own stocks on the back of the corporation tax cuts, something trump profits from. It is also gives zero benefit to average joe public.
937 2018-02-04 14:23:27 The tradeable stocks r not the whole Econ. Much activity from govt and charities and wholly-owned private firms.  It's a poor theory.  Imo

940 2018-02-04 14:21:24 RT @ItWorksbyJenni: @realDonaldTrump Any comments on the NYSE and DOW closing at -666 on Friday? It was crashing all day Friday and not one peep about how great the stocks and economy are. I guess you can't read numbers either. You are a liar and need to be impeached. #crick…
941 2018-02-04 14:20:39 Nouriel also called out a stock market bubble - so what’s your point? Because stocks are in a bubble bitcoin isn’t??
942 2018-02-04 14:20:35 Stocks go down when wages go up, because it temporariliy hurts the profit going to the shareholders as more goes out to the workers.  So, yeah, Trump will take credit for it.
943 2018-02-04 14:18:48 But what makes people work?  Money.  The combination of necessity of finances in order to maintain a living standard, along with a desire to pool said finances and make it work via business investment like stocks bonds and such, and personal, as education, are the result.
944 2018-02-04 14:18:38 Counter to popular narrative, QE was not "printing money" -- it was just an asset swap on the Fed's balance sheet. What QE ultimately did was inflate asset prices like stocks, real estate, and... bitcoin. It did not help the real economy.

950 2018-02-04 14:12:40 Waiting for the GOP to blame George Soros, the Deep State, Hillary Clinton, Obama, the FBI, the CIA or kneeling NFL players for the decline in stocks. Of course, like Nunes’ memo claims, liberals are trying to undermine Trump.
951 2018-02-04 14:12:03 Economists agree: former President Barack Obama is not responsible for anything good economically – despite what many lefties in the press want the uninformed to believe.

954 2018-02-04 14:10:09 hedge(방지책) : Stocks can be a hedge against infaltion. 주식이 인플레에 대한 방지책이 될 수 있다.
955 2018-02-04 14:08:55 Agree. Further to that point, Fed Ratio and Yardeni models aren’t close to the points where they’d signal ‘buy bonds over stocks’ — S&P 500 earnings yield is 4.25%, for example.
956 2018-02-04 14:08:51 Don’t be too biased, as you forgot to select the 1987 where the yield curve did not a) invert and b) re-steepen. 

You also want to look at German and Japanese equities, where stocks drop often and hard, and yet the yield curve doesn’t always do what you expect.
957 2018-02-04 14:08:32 How about some common sense gun control laws?

959 2018-02-04 14:07:52 Let's focus on the same message. FnF don't need Capital raised in the form of Preferreds/Common Stocks, it only raises cash that we don't know where to invest it if the Investment Portfolio will be wound down.
MBS investors provide Capital for operations.
FnF need Retained Earngs
960 2018-02-04 14:06:35 As economy improves, interest rates on fixed assets increase. Every Fed rate increase will dampen stock market. 3 scheduled for this year. Fixed assets then compete with stocks for investment cash. Dems/GOP talks about "the now" jockeying for midterms but this was foreseeable.

964 2018-02-04 14:01:11 Thats funny the left says Trump doesn't get credit for stocks going up. But they say he's the reason they dropped the other day. Seems they change who gets credit to fit their narrative.

971 2018-02-04 13:53:20 Where is the update on stocks? You have usually tweeted about that.

Oh..it dropped by 666! Possibly a pretty BIG correction despite being the biggest drop since Brexit!!!

More to come, I'm sure!
972 2018-02-04 13:53:19 So what did happen really with the CDC....is this really about stocks or is it about bad vaccinations and leadership at the CDC...??
973 2018-02-04 13:52:51 Here's a question I don't know the answer to Ben - how would markets work if active investors all gave up and the only passive tracker funds owned stocks? Would they work? I can't get my head around it! Surely we need active investors getting it right and getting it wrong?
974 2018-02-04 13:51:49 Ah, but you could put it in your 401k and invest in stocks and... Checks Dow Jones... Down 666 points... Shit!

978 2018-02-04 13:50:39 Don't make me laugh.

1000 2018-02-04 13:34:18 Most are not buying anything on the stock market. Almost half of US citizens do not have any investments at all, if they do it is likely in a 401k that gets no attention paid to it. 92% of stocks are owned by 20% of the population, no idea what percentage of that bought bitcoin.
1001 2018-02-04 13:34:12 Most stocks r down 30 percent..
1002 2018-02-04 13:33:37 Those guns are brought in across state lines. Federal gun control could work. That's the only thing left to try but Republicans don't want to give up bump stocks, semi-auto weapons, or limit who can buy what. Does it hurt to try him control? Better than continuing to lose lives.
1003 2018-02-04 13:33:23 If you want to ban bump stocks, then you have to ban belt loops.  Look it up on youtube.  This whole 2A thing was for muskets play is a dead argument.  Puckle gun, Girandoni Rifle, and multiple court rulings have settled that.

Hell, an earlier poll showed the majority  giving Obama credit for the economy! His administration averaged 1.5% GDP, which is the weakest economy since the Depression.
1014 2018-02-04 13:14:00 Or interest rates rising. Stocks correcting themselves after interest rates being nothing for years. But sure, play up the hype joe

1056 2018-02-04 12:39:22 Just think how cheap good Li stocks will be when the dust settles!

1060 2018-02-04 12:37:32 I am fine with banning bump stocks, as are most.  What is troubling is that is your focus when so little has been released about that shooting.  Dig deeper Dianne!  We want answers and this stinks of a cover-up.  Your focus on bump stocks almost makes you look complicit.
1061 2018-02-04 12:37:00 Weekend done! Time to do my homework for this week's trading. $DJIA seems to be having a correction. I'll be watching #PSEi 8800 and 8500 as support and signals for me to be careful. I'll let my stocks stop me out. #PHStockMarket
1062 2018-02-04 12:36:03 Lowest GDP would be an economic disaster. High GDP is what you want. Your stock market is, despite last week’s slide, at record highs, that is true. Which btw is great for our oil fund too, since we own shitloads of US stocks. Unemployment low, yes, crime not so much.
1063 2018-02-04 12:35:32 The number of declining U.S. stocks reached more than 27,000, the most since July 2014. #MAGA Wall Street closed off the week with its biggest % drop in two years. @realDonaldTrump must of missed this cuz he's not tweeting about the market so I'm helping him out
1064 2018-02-04 12:35:26 Obviously Arabella is a budding bundle of talents Kristie Lu darling, my sunshine. I hope you did all I asked you to do concerning her honey i.e her Trust Fund, stocks.
1065 2018-02-04 12:35:02 TIP --> trump holds major stocks in big banks, oil, gas etc etc. that he claims he sold in 2016. this is a lie! why else would he push offshore drilling. he don't do a thing unless it profits him. like you'll find those stocks under the trump organization perhaps in  kids name.
1066 2018-02-04 12:32:13 Yeah I agree with that analysis! Sometimes random stuff happens to stocks which aren’t indicative of the economy. As I have said previously it’s not a bad indicator long term, very volatile short term.
1067 2018-02-04 12:30:48 Wishing @Tom_Stocks @steffieegg12 and everyone @actorawareness a great night. Sad I can't be there. Honoured to be a Patron of such a wonderful movement that's making a real difference

1069 2018-02-04 12:29:51 Try studying Econ 101. Interest rates on bonds in particular under a different admin were very low. Now was the time to get rid of them. And also sell off some of the now Thank G more valuable stocks. It’s called corrections DA.
1070 2018-02-04 12:28:55 how are those stocks doing desperate Don?

1090 2018-02-04 12:12:42 Something very simple. Stocks defying gravity, stories floating around, stocks going up on SM forwards, big investor buys, stock with questionable managements and promoters going up sharply, promoters selling, raising money via QIP, and so on. All these tell us something. Listen.
1091 2018-02-04 12:11:16 I shared this video of crypto currency girl idols to my geeky cousin who's also doing crypto and we ended up talking abt bitcoin's value bc they lost bigtime lmao I barely made it out after peaking so he asked what I'm doing w/ my assets now and I said I put them in stocks―

1098 2018-02-04 12:04:59 They certainly *can* be correlated on a sustained basis, but the period you reference was all about inflation/disinflation. Today you can't argue that long-term rates will keep rising while stocks keep falling w/o an inflation spike story.

1100 2018-02-04 12:01:52 Nobody, even the spokesman of BJP has high lighted that penny stocks were the best/only way to convert large sums of black money into white without paying any tax. This step will curb it. Now no way to evade tax for big fish.

1114 2018-02-04 11:34:31 We should all be thankful to have a POTUS who loves his country and is doing everything in his power to see us succeed. Stocks are up, unemployment is down and jobs are coming back. How can Congress be so blinded by hate?  Replace all haters in Congress
1115 2018-02-04 11:34:10 it is if most of your wealth is in equities and you make truckloads of money from dividends...you know..like most americans :) though it was very clever to link retirement to stocks. now the common people are rooting for the 'right' teams...
1116 2018-02-04 11:33:29 If Your able to buy stocks from Your employer (do it for it’s generally at a discount price), learn and research upon Your investment, learn about “Dividends and splits and how the game is played” let Your money work for You...
1117 2018-02-04 11:30:58 On LTCG for stocks, there was no need to disallow the indexation benefit this year since Jaithly agreed to protect the value as of 31st January. This can be introduced after one year. Consider withdrawing it and revive market sentiments

1119 2018-02-04 11:28:35 If peoples who are investing in Stocks Market only for the purpose of tax exemption, they should quit market & go into farming (where 100% tax exemption)
1120 2018-02-04 11:28:24 Someone should make a crypto-coin where people can do weekend and night trading of stocks and then it all gets bought on the market when the markets open.
1121 2018-02-04 11:28:01 Mall of Asia was included into our itinerary last field trip and i had one thing in mind: GO TO ASTROPLUS AND LOOK FOR REPUTATION ALBUM, and guess what:

"I'm sorry, limited stocks only." BOOM DISAPPOINTMENT
1122 2018-02-04 11:27:39 Why do we have to see "value" in traditional terms? These aren't stocks and shares. Its belief in a project. We all say look at the team. Well $TRX and @justinsuntron have connections to Alibaba and Jack Ma... I could believe in the power of that
1123 2018-02-04 11:27:18 You people crack me up. Proof there’s no Russia collusion. Taxes r great jobs are booming stocks are up. And this is all u got
1124 2018-02-04 11:25:02 People are reading @Theeconomist because they know no better and are attracted by the name. 

Why are people buying stocks at 30 X PE?   The trump trade has already caused a 50% rally from the election night lows.    Which dwarfs the tax cut. 

Why aren't you writing about that?
1125 2018-02-04 11:21:38 TKU, I have always have #FP4 in stock and always want to try new stocks.
1126 2018-02-04 11:21:14 If I could I’ll buy stocks from Spotify.
1127 2018-02-04 11:20:38 Totally agree with you sir. The first time when I had come to know that long term is just 365 days for stocks I was surprised , how can 365 days considered to be long term
1128 2018-02-04 11:20:14 HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH. 

And when rates rise and house prices crash 70%, same event. The house ownership dream (Ponzi) has been around for 50 years.

And now that investors are realising that stocks are 10-15% overpriced.  Same event. 

We already had the correction.

1134 2018-02-04 11:16:01 Chinas biggest banks transporting BITCOIN ATM’s. Besides that looking at the chart this is rhe perfect buy point for bitcoin. Still It will have 1k-2k dip but comparing to the comeback its nothing. So the stocks trading experts will use this opportunity to buy.
1135 2018-02-04 11:14:51 All stocks will correct regardless of fundamental but when to buy will be the question
1136 2018-02-04 11:14:25 OK does this mean "last shoot week of 2018" bearing in mind it's only Feb or "last shoot week for FP4+ in 2018" so other film stocks to follow? 
1137 2018-02-04 11:12:35 @MartinSLewis If I have a stocks and shares ISA, do I have to sell and then repurchase all holdings to convert it to a LISA, paying doubles fees? Also is the maximum purchase value likely to increase (in real terms) over time?
1138 2018-02-04 11:11:27 Yeah stocks can raise with rates. It’s comes back to market confidence, if money was at 5% and knew you could make 10%, you would get the loan! But if you don’t hve confidence in a market, then rates could be at 1% yet you still wouldn’t buy the market. confidence is everything

1168 2018-02-04 10:35:03 The reason why I posted a couple quality long setups is that you never know what the market will do next. A correction is likely but how long and deep that will be is anyones guess. And it is always worth trying to get in the early mover of the next rally. #stocks
1169 2018-02-04 10:34:04 Yep, longterm is bullish no doubt but short term is anyone's guess. For myself I'll keep watching the Global X Lithium ETF - so far its still looking for support, so imho there's no rush to buy Li stocks yet.

1185 2018-02-04 10:11:53 If you think stocks selling and buying doesn't generate genuine jobs you are either ignorant of why biz raise funds from mkt or simply supporting the govt regardless of what it does. Either ways doesn't do credit to a long journalistic career

في مثل الحالات التي تمر بها أسواقنا حالياً
أفضل القراءات الفنية هي ما يسمى بالتقاطعات للمتوسطات الحركية
تقاطع الموت
التقاطع الذهبي
تقاطع الموت إنتهينا منه
ننتظر الذهبي .... ما نزال بعيدين نسبياً عنه
لكنها قراءة ذات مصداقية عالية 
اثبتت هذا في مناسبات كثيرة سابقة

1220 2018-02-04 09:36:55 Hmm. The article actually says the capacity of Chinese factories to turn spodumene into LCE is unknown, and probably less than stated. The fear is a LCE production bottleneck & stockpiling of spodumene, hence the selling of Li stocks. The article doesn't dispel that fear.

1223 2018-02-04 09:35:35 In ANY relatively volatile market technical analysis does ABSOLUTELY nothing. Look for upcoming news about the company/commodity and not the graphs. Graphs look nice, and that’s about as useful as they get.

1247 2018-02-04 09:03:30 I agree and that makes it difficult to distinguish the good from the bad.

In such a market you need at least experience and better some skills too. I have a bit of the former from investing in stocks but not much of the latter, as I work in a completely different area in real li
1248 2018-02-04 09:02:24 Stocks in craw? I’ve not heard that before 
1249 2018-02-04 09:01:25 Let's entertain the thought that, even if US and EU stocks run into some rebalancing-induced headwinds here, economic fundamentals are likely to support continued commodity strength and EM outperformance, especially given strong "buy last year's winners" flows into the latter
1250 2018-02-04 08:59:20 Yes and no, reports I saw were that it was shot down with an Igla, at least 74 of which were identified missing from Transnistrian stocks in 2003. Turkish support clearly more like if this becomes a trend, though.

1265 2018-02-04 08:40:59 The last 500 points rally in NIFTY was completely EAT premium in derivatives case hence stocks did not participate in that rally except INDEX heavy weights. NSE PE had reached 28 and price to book was at 3.8 which were already dangerous signs. (1/1)
1266 2018-02-04 08:40:36 All those Dow Chemical stocks I guess.
1267 2018-02-04 08:38:56 invest in midcaps. Also unless they create havoc in midcaps and get  the  stop losses triggers they will not get desired liquidity in the  stocks.  Therefore we see in next 2 months commensurate of buying in  midcaps. (1/3)

1280 2018-02-04 08:25:41 LTCG should be exempt for stocks invested in Primary Market. These are held through high & low.
1281 2018-02-04 08:24:40 Thanks Paul. Yes, I try to remain "realistic" and "truth seeking" at all times. And, frankly, I struggle with those who don't.

  Macro Numbers & Global Cues:
  On Monday, the performance of Services sector in January, 2018 will be known.
  &
 Domestic market will also take cues from global stocks and tread accordingly.
1283 2018-02-04 08:22:22 Stocks went up I won’t really n truly 
1284 2018-02-04 08:21:24 Dalal street: Now the fact that whole world has gone short and bought PUT market has to bounce back because market needs shorts for long. Longs all got CUT and squared off and market is absolutely lighter. All fat gone in 1 day. Many stocks hit lower circuit thanks to margin call
1285 2018-02-04 08:21:06 Exactly right. Before nuclear deal our reactors ran at 50% capacity factor at best, now they run at 70-80% & we have fuel stocks saved up for several years.
1286 2018-02-04 08:20:13 Hence instead of 20% corporate INDIA will pay now 4% on stocks as of 31st JAN 2018 and 10% on stocks bought after 31 st March 2018.  (1/2)
1287 2018-02-04 08:20:11 #bitcoin $8,000 is a reason to party because I made more money selling all my stocks for bitcoin than my stocks made in over 10yrs
1288 2018-02-04 08:18:56 The funny thing is that Trump just beat Obama for biggest single day point drop. What's worse is there is still more room to fall. 5% drop is healthy and it barely hit 4%. I'm hoping we don't have a black Monday and it rockets back up. But stocks take stairs up and elevator down

1295 2018-02-04 08:06:37 Wages are only going up because cities past laws, requiring companies to raise the minimum wage. How much money did people lose in the stock market today?   No mention of stocks dropping over 650 points, because of  your recklessness.  Why is that?
1296 2018-02-04 08:06:13 Which are those stocks ?
1297 2018-02-04 08:06:00 Brent oil hits $71 for first time since 2014 as U.S. stocks decline. Via @Reuters #oil #brent @mkshatti @IEABirol @World_Oil_Price
1298 2018-02-04 08:05:15 i bought a few stocks yesterday through @zerodhaonline Kite app and they were showing up in my Positions. Now I don't see anything anywhere with the funds back as Free Cash. Is this normal? Will they show up in my Holdings on Monday when the markets open?
1299 2018-02-04 08:04:00 It's this simple. I am from a fishing family who were forced out of Gt Yarmouth in the 30's because of over fishing yes the 30's fish stocks were hammered long before the Common Market, EC or EU - fact. Yet this is never mentioned. I challenged Farage directly - he walked away
1300 2018-02-04 08:02:44 Ok madam stocks you would say na
1301 2018-02-04 08:02:00 will there be stocks? :(
1302 2018-02-04 08:00:54 رايك في اركان والحمادي وصناعات كهربائيه،،؟؟
1303 2018-02-04 07:59:59 Banks in general view black people as bad debts. Which is exactly why I thought capitecs stocks were being manipulated.
1304 2018-02-04 07:56:13 It is extremely difficult for a certain individual to do this and anyways why would they. It will only make the masses happy as no more than 1% Indians invest in stocks and the remaining 99% rejoice when the markets go down. It is a typical indian mentality.
1305 2018-02-04 07:56:10 I hope this is true.  It will be a fantastic opportunity to buy and make a killing. When indian stocks tanked in 2008 I made the most money because I believe in long term india story. So let them crash the market and let the rest of us mint money at their cost.

1309 2018-02-04 07:47:37 Yes absolutely, now one more trend is going on, a celebrity investor like Porinju comes on tv and when he mentions his favourite names that stocks already up by more than 5% even before his mentioning
And after few minutes those stocks are flat!!!
1310 2018-02-04 07:46:27 You are absolutely right 
Mother of all markets US decides movement of stocks

1311 2018-02-04 07:44:23 1) stock market is Not an valid indicator of a booming economy
It’s a consequence of low interest rates and cheap money, usually introduced by central banks to push a struggling economy. With extremely low base rates world wide investors NEED to invest in stocks.
1312 2018-02-04 07:43:13 In the market correction, look for fav stocks which wd fall the least. Some stocks wd defy the gravity to large extent. And those are the ones to add heavily. Just forget abt LTCG tax completely to focus on such stocks.

1317 2018-02-04 07:36:03 Yeah some people 1 million. Who knows. I'd rather invest in stocks and commodities. If you know what you're doing and use leverage u can make all the money in the world. Bitcoin is very risky, if u get it at the right time though u can make $ but its kind of random

1325 2018-02-04 07:26:50 If your purpose for investing in stock market is for tax exemption, then u should quit investing in stocks and do farming instead as income from farming is 100% tax exempt!
1326 2018-02-04 07:25:25 Stock market crash ahead. Doesn't look good for them. John do you also think that bear market in stocks is gonna push the crypto market rocket like upwards? This is what I expect. Big money goes there where they can win.

1328 2018-02-04 07:17:55 It's possible even if you're not in politics, if you've investors/FII on your side you can target 2/3 stocks and beat them down which causes the overall stock market to go down, George Soros is a prime example.

1339 2018-02-04 07:05:29 Indeed a great show with great guests. Umair's point on manufacturing was important but I feel his example of Starbucks cannot be generalised since lot of U.S companies also share their stocks, as well as other benefits, generously with their employees as well.

bond yields are still high in india  which makes stocks unattractive & yields are rising globally from their record lows & stocks are at an all time highs. I might be wrong but this seems to me logical thing

1369 2018-02-04 06:24:40 @billmaher This constantly comes up on Real Time - the cause of wealth inequality is inflation.  Inflation in stocks and real estate makes rich people richer and makes it harder for poor people to acquire assets and meet basic needs.  Inflation is caused by printing money.
1370 2018-02-04 06:24:16 You are right. Only stocks which were low on 31/1/18 and can grow big in value thro FY18-19  can raise taxes. Market shift needed.

1374 2018-02-04 06:19:29 Nifty can be wherever top or bottom but history speaks one truth all stocks wont align with market unless if its downways so whenever market goes into panic mode look for good companies and buy them in SIP mode you will earn in 3 to 5 years #HistoryNeverFails

The economy can be controlled, jobs withheld for Obama, released for Trump/GOP. Now gratuitous efforts made to wealthy with TaxScam, creating wealth to invest in market drop.

1410 2018-02-04 05:44:47 Yep, along with putting 1929 into perspective.
However the consequences after won't be good.

1437 2018-02-04 05:25:18 PLZ NAME SOME GOOD STOCKS. ON FRIDAY ALLLLLL STOCKS WERE FALLING. PROBLEM IS IN INDIA WE HAVE MORE SHEEP. JUST FOLLOW W/O THINKING - SORRY FOR THIS OPEN COMMENT.REAL ESTATE STORY OVER. GOLD ALSO STORY OVER. SO ALLLL ARE IN SHAREMARKET NO FUNDAMENTAL WORK HERE.

“Well, you only get this metabolism once.”
1440 2018-02-04 05:18:22 Of course fundamentals matter when buying stocks. Let’s not fool ourselves and say they don’t. Markets run on earnings and liquidity. #stocks
1441 2018-02-04 05:18:06 Stocks are falling under your watch, not good.
1442 2018-02-04 05:16:24 Socks 'n Stocks. It's a way of life.

1443 2018-02-04 05:15:56 They have been dropping steadily since 2010.. but if tRump wants to take credit for that then he should also take credit for January 2018.. black unemployment rose from record low 6.8 to 7.7.. and how about those stocks??
1444 2018-02-04 05:15:48 The unbridled joy of having an 18 month old boy means I am getting smacked at the side of the head at 5am anyway. Never too early to start breaking stuff!

I trade stocks primarily and always via limit orders so the time difference is no problem.
1445 2018-02-04 05:15:27 It’s a sale on stocks!
1446 2018-02-04 05:13:40 May drop next week buts stocks are going up. Look at the GDP guys it’s moving at the fastest rate in many years...
1447 2018-02-04 05:12:44 Incorporate STRONG controls in every Writing-Off Transactions of Stocks e.g. Sales, Consumption, Abnormal / Normal Losses etc.
1448 2018-02-04 05:12:24 First people complained the market is too high and didn’t buy, now the markets are falling they still aren’t buying much due to fear. If you were comfortable buying stock at 3x why aren’t you buying it at x? #stocks.
1449 2018-02-04 05:12:18 Unfortunately, the reality for all businesses, stocks, or even start-ups. The majority is initially held only by the smallest numbers. You have 90% of the wealth with 10% or less population. Wake-up concentrated capitalism bites when you see through the Prism @vijayshekhar
1450 2018-02-04 05:11:37 All the talk of exiting small cap stocks. I feel big investors are giving a jerk to small investors so that they will exit good stocks and then they can take those stocks up vertically. But I feel this is a very good opportunity to cherry pick some of the small caps. #investing
1451 2018-02-04 05:11:16 So what if the person is already paying 30% tax and yet the government again wants to tax whatever he has earned even if he puts it into stocks FDs or House property. Is that not double taxation? Pls think this aspect!
1452 2018-02-04 05:11:16 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
1453 2018-02-04 05:11:07 Thank you Chris... mention that on the show. Stocks have very little direct effect on the lives of poor and middle class Americans. and 401k will not be enough to live in in retirement. your next huge financial crisis. we need to return to defined benefits plans

1456 2018-02-04 05:09:45 Bring Double Entry System in Stocks Transactions with  Source & Destinations and Let System Maintain Both ends Ledgers. Create accountability in every stocks movement.
1457 2018-02-04 05:09:44 It’s cyclical for markets to fall. Can’t call tops and bottoms. Keep SIP into good companies. You don’t have to go all in. Keep cash as well. #stocks
1458 2018-02-04 05:07:44 Integrated Stores NEVER allow Non-Scheduled Items Issues for any Destination. STOP issuing Unaccountable Stocks.
1459 2018-02-04 05:07:42 Bubble obvious.
Stocks soaring while incomes near flat and many nil-wage is exactly same pattern housing had
1460 2018-02-04 05:07:40 Ok when I'm talking probability I'm not doing it based of Vegas odds, that's like investing in stocks because you buy from that company, like no you buy into things you study and know will make you money, I knew aswell as anyone else who truly watches UFC was going to win maybe
1461 2018-02-04 05:07:13 Nope, I'm not saying that. I was merely reacting to your number of 2100. I don't get into the game of predicting where the markets will go based off of technicals or price levels. My personal focus is on selection of high quality stocks to hold through all market environments.
1462 2018-02-04 05:06:13 with Kerry as in all other cases follow the money trail, he benefited off Obamacare passage as did many others, here's how, they passed the bill and immediately bought healthcare stocks either right before or soon after passage so bill benefited them in stock market.
1463 2018-02-04 05:05:18 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNEWS @FOXNEWS 
AMERICA! **BREAKING ** AGAIN, YOUR STOCKS, 401K ETC TOOK A HELL OF A BEATING. BUSINESSES ARE TIRED OF TRUMP MAD PROMISES.THEY WANT TO SEE SOME ECONOMY GROWTH. BUSINESSES PUTTING OUT FINANCIALLY WITH NOTHING  COMING IN.
1464 2018-02-04 05:02:59 Absolutely ridiculous to believe that money is made effortlessly by investors and traders. It takes a deep understand of financial risks involved, of capital, and to have faith in a company’s vision. To say that it’s effortless is a big . #stocks #investing
1465 2018-02-04 05:02:34 He sent it to you yesterday he said stocks
1466 2018-02-04 05:01:46 I think it’s time to bring back the stocks. Let the doctor face public humiation for a couple of days before going to jail.
1467 2018-02-04 05:01:41 As much as I’d like to agree, Joe, stocks are priced a bit high. A correction is a natural part of the market. Now, I’d go out on a limb to say that the correction is not making people in the administration very happy. It ruins the story line about their greatness.
1468 2018-02-04 04:59:54 Those all look like pretty low inflationary periods though. Still I would be surprised if going back to periods of much higher CPI changes the conclusion. I remember stocks being touted as a good hedge against inflation - e.g. when more companies had pricing power.

1474 2018-02-04 04:53:14 My friend, wat is the effort unput in wen ur stocks tank for no reason of urs? Nothing..similarly with cap gains..u only buy stocks, loss or gains r beyond ur control,
1475 2018-02-04 04:51:49 Whenever there is a good fall in market we should take advantage of “Exchange Offer”. High Quality stocks also fall by more or less same % as Lower Quality stocks so we should exchange them. Once market rebounds you want to be with your best players and not with the injured ones.
1476 2018-02-04 04:51:01 Oil field money X working stocks =gold
1477 2018-02-04 04:51:01 Manipulation of language is their way.  I say, roll with it.  Lower taxes, SCOTUS, Paris Climat Hoax exited, TPP abandoned, jobs jobs jobs, stronger military thanks to Putin wanting Trump to do that for us, 401K up, Stocks Up, etc.  Who doesn't wanna be in this great "cult"?
1478 2018-02-04 04:50:34 Do Graphite stocks are still a buy after export tariff announcement but not impossition at the moment?
1479 2018-02-04 04:50:16 Not at all, ask away, though l'm no expert. Machine guns usually fire at a much higher rate of fire. Bump fire stocks don't turn a rifle/carbine into an MG.
1480 2018-02-04 04:47:58 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1486 2018-02-04 04:43:11 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1487 2018-02-04 04:43:02 Sensex is measured on the basis of 30 stocks only. Just manipulate it and reach 50,000
1488 2018-02-04 04:42:15 Think if I was not a tax payer or dodging it before DEMO & thereafter came under IT. Went for MF for tax saving. Now as MFs hold stocks for more than year I will be charged LTGC even if I hold for less than year.
Should I pay @10 to avoid @5 income tax.
1489 2018-02-04 04:40:22 Stocks and cricket are no match. There are hundreds of good stocks, if you can manage them then why not buy. Real problem is a human can reasonably track a dozen stocks only. Track stock meaning business news, price movement, sectoral trends
1490 2018-02-04 04:40:21 fine ass women dropping investment tips and hot stocks in my dm, life is much better

1493 2018-02-04 04:38:41 Senator:  50% of Americans own stocks in their IRA’s and 410k’s.  Paying dividends goes into their pockets and retirement accounts.  How can this be bad. Contrary to Fancy Nancy’s comments tax cuts that have resulted in bonuses and pay increases are not “crumbs”.  JM
1494 2018-02-04 04:38:23 Hey Tim - I’m serious btw, I’ve been very successful in sales. My passion is trading and stocks and would be willing to make the investment. Nyc meeting?
1495 2018-02-04 04:37:43 I just want to thank Paul Ryan for educating us about the school secretary whose pay increased by 1.50 per week. I see he is helping make America Great Again. Wonder how she will invest the 1.50 per week? Stocks, bonds, perhaps put a down payment on a house? New car possibly?
1496 2018-02-04 04:36:39 Actually it was because of increased bond yields so allocations are moving from stocks to bonds. Bonds are increasing in value because of expectations of inflation driven by the tax cut on top of an already strong economy.
1497 2018-02-04 04:34:28 I mean I think it’s funny, it’s stocks, but 500x more riskier. Gotta be willing to lose everything for some profit. The wave wasn’t going to last forever. But that’s gambling for you

1499 2018-02-04 04:33:58 Yeah, even in 2007, we hit first down day and recovered, I feel this is the first down side in this up trend, bounce back is needed! How many retailers hold stocks at Thursday Highs, is biggest question??
1500 2018-02-04 04:31:08 Starbucks stocks immediately trend!
1501 2018-02-04 04:30:36 As important as rate levels are, they can’t be looked at in a vacuum in assessing their go-forward impact on stocks.
1502 2018-02-04 04:29:36 The best thing is to pick up good stocks, forget the lines and enjoy the beach ;)

1504 2018-02-04 04:29:04 your stocks getting slammed again, what happened to your baba ' breakout' ? i think you like to LOSE PEOPLES MONEY! buy steel at 39, FOR WHAT??!
1505 2018-02-04 04:28:44 Can you provide stocks which recommended earlier but having opportunity after market correction
1506 2018-02-04 04:28:26 Pot stocks will likely dip more until market is done balancing, relax take a deep breath and try not to panic sell. So much potential in some of these bigger companies the wait will be worth it. #ACB #TSX

1508 2018-02-04 04:26:09 Who the hell cares what clinton did.  I want to know why stocks are falling, big companies moving out of country, wages 1.50 increase a week?  Really, really??  The 4 pg memo was a nothing buger, but Russia is real. Sleep well
1509 2018-02-04 04:25:53 @iancassel @natstewart5 for microcap stocks, where do you put your bid (appears to be really wide)?
1510 2018-02-04 04:24:42 Look on the bright , Dems gave us insight to invest in mental health drug stocks.....
1511 2018-02-04 04:24:42 well partial answer Pelosi has a banker husband, you should look at real estate deals and see if any involved, passing bills that benefit them in stock market for example as soon as or right before Obama care passed many bought healthcare stocks know John Kerry and others did it

1513 2018-02-04 04:24:18 Bonds and stocks may be overvalued but this will be a drop of 20-30% which bitcoin is moving up and down every couple of days. There is a difference between being overvalued by 20% and bringt overvalued by 100%

1519 2018-02-04 04:19:23 Stock market tanked. Fewest Americans have savings, a key indicator before a recession. Margin leverage high. Overvalued stocks. Slower job growth than Obama. You sure you want to talk about that comrade?
1520 2018-02-04 04:17:38 re; Not all stocks are created equal.   Gotta do the work my friend.  I know you will... Although It did take some time for me to learn it the hard way, I did eventually realize that Ben Hogan was right when he said "The harder I work, the luckier I get".
1521 2018-02-04 04:17:11 Also not sure if you’re into this when you go home but Whole Foods now stocks Topo Chico.

1523 2018-02-04 04:16:13 You don't know that because there has been no leaks from the investigation - oh and also did you check your stocks on Friday afternoon 
1524 2018-02-04 04:14:33 Dude, seriously?!   Didn’t your “daily report” tell you stocks were down almost 700 points?  Joblessness is at 7.7% now and rising.   Coal ISN’T CLEAN?!   Any of this ring a bell???
1525 2018-02-04 04:12:44 I flip a lot of stocks.  In and out within 3-7 days and do ok with this.  I'm doing pretty good on my swings this year so far.  Called RNN at 1.80 and it hit $2.80 a couple weeks ago
Called $BICX at .07 and it went to .28 last week 
And bought $bstn at .01 and it's at .008

1529 2018-02-04 04:08:55 It seems like bump stocks are a bad idea for the common folk, no? I am not familiar with guns, so asking honestly here.
1530 2018-02-04 04:07:06 If they didn't have money to buy stocks before, then the down turn isn't affecting them.  I doubt it will stay down for long.  They say the best strategy is to buy slowly over time and plan leave your money in.  It will come back.
1531 2018-02-04 04:06:27 Will post some charts of stocks that are breaking down from critical levels.

1538 2018-02-04 04:00:36 Stocks dropped 700 points and African American unemployment sharply rose last check, so there' s that.....
1539 2018-02-04 04:00:07 Charts track momentum and crowd pressures.  The more thinly traded, the more easily manipulated and the more likely for misleading chart technicals.  A tool to be used, but should not be the only reason for a buy or sell.  IMO.

1563 2018-02-04 03:34:36 Even stocks prices should be Grandfathered such that they don't come below 31-Jan-18 levels
1564 2018-02-04 03:33:12 This tax free LTCG was only way to erode taxes through penny stocks. If you can see it as a bold step the previous government could not take...
1565 2018-02-04 03:32:32 Subscriptions in my opinion and also perks from companies which they recommend .it's very easy .. buy some hot stocks on futures and sell the same in different account .. in one month time .. show and advertise the one showing profits and get some suckers to subscribe .
1566 2018-02-04 03:31:34 Wages rising 0.1% faster than they just were, woohoo!  Did you see the stock market tank on the news and expectations your debt funded tax cut for the rich will send inflations skyrocketing?  Guess you'll stop talking stocks and your sheep will buy anything.
1567 2018-02-04 03:30:45 10% of Americans own 80% of all stocks.  The rest of us will be screwed when the GOP deregulates you to set up another 2008. Thanks.
1568 2018-02-04 03:30:15 whatever you tweet, don't tweet about Pevek, Chukotka, gold, real estate, stocks, politicians, bitcoin, banks, northern route
1569 2018-02-04 03:29:01 He supports 1 bogus news channel.

He supports ONLY law enforcement that isn’t investigating him.

He has no clue what’s in the constitution. 

Accountability? He literally NEVER accepts responsibility for anything other than stocks...which he has little to do with.
1570 2018-02-04 03:28:54 Global stocks and bonds (+ Aussie housing + cryptos) take a synchronised dip. Start of the end of the big asset price rise?
1571 2018-02-04 03:28:29 But once people got used to it they grew more natural like the stocks we would see in the united states stock markets following the great recession of 2009. The first 12 years were turmoil though. 2021 was when it all seemed to level out
1572 2018-02-04 03:25:55 #Analysis for #NIFTYFUTURE #BANKNIFTY #Stocks #Commodities done !!!!!

1573 2018-02-04 03:24:20 Point is the number 666....  of course it’s going to go up and down...stocks do that......
1574 2018-02-04 03:23:38 And how much has it increased in the past year??  Geesh!!  You’re obviously someone who does not own stocks or you would get it!
1575 2018-02-04 03:23:20 Keep the stocks put an aggressive 35x13.50 on it. I love they way they look like that. Clean and simple

1579 2018-02-04 03:18:29 As we always cried :-( 

Not only this even the FMV calculation is a scam
IMHO. Plus treating gains on foreign traded stocks as short term..
1580 2018-02-04 03:14:50 Stocks will recover..
But we need a objective perspective and look ahead potential of this great American icon in terms wealth creation
1581 2018-02-04 03:14:08 Really normal people don't own Stocks? 
IRA's and 401k's don't earn off of Investments?
I'm a Disabled Veteran NOT WEALTHY and I have literally made 78.15% Profit off my Stocks last year, THANK YOU!@realDonaldTrump
1582 2018-02-04 03:12:13 Honestly i put money on stocks and idk shit about stocks
1583 2018-02-04 03:11:23 Do the signals pick up volume spikes? Been looking for that! Think or swim has it for stocks but who wants to mess with stocks any more lol. Feels like an old folk home.
1584 2018-02-04 03:10:44 A lot of people thought blockchain would just be a currency. However, it actually added a whole new dimension. At some point long ago people actually started to trade these currencies as if they were stocks or shares in a company. People expected results. People wanted more money
1585 2018-02-04 03:10:19 Everything Adam and his Comrades at CNN says is Bias,disgusting and horrible remember DJT would never win the nomination, never win the general the stocks would crash collusion is real the memo would kill FBI need to go on¿ THEY ARE FAKE LIE CHEAT MISLEAD MAKE UP........
1586 2018-02-04 03:09:56 It’s a mutual relationship I hate Greenville also
1587 2018-02-04 03:09:40 Yes, just as Warren Buffett wanted to warn people about Bitcoin, right before NYSX & co listed and shorted it, extracting 50% of the market cap and funnelling it back into gold and stocks. 

Such interference will only work in the short term. In the long term, bye bye Facebook!

Man, what a time to be alive!
1592 2018-02-04 03:05:44 My stocks took a hit yesterday, dude. What about that?
1593 2018-02-04 03:05:38 “What did you do tonight?” oh y’know just learned how to play fortnite in a full face of makeup bc Greenville hates me trying to make plans
1594 2018-02-04 03:05:19 Nice bounce off that 8 day forming that sexy Thors Hammer Papa!
Loving this one for the coming weeks/months!
1595 2018-02-04 03:04:23 I’m glad a holes have a public platform to whine and bitch on. The market correction has nothing at all to do with Trump ( well, that’s not exactly true. It’s because of the raging economy and people are afraid of inflation so some$ is coming out stocks and will go in to bonds ).
1596 2018-02-04 03:04:13 Stocks go up and down.... look at how much the stocks have gone up since Trump has been voted in!  Trump 2020! MAGA!!!!!
1597 2018-02-04 03:04:13 Stocks will rise and fall always have and always will it's a fact of history!! 
No one has president has ever helped the go higher!! Never !!
1598 2018-02-04 03:03:16 WOW!!! Im shocked!!- as well as disappointed. This is supposedly only one of TWO banks that deal with ppl and supposedly stocks in the weed business. Its very prejudiced 
1599 2018-02-04 03:01:07 Speaking of numbers and news, how about that Dow? Wow, I didn't want to check my stocks yesterday. Ouch!
1600 2018-02-04 03:00:44 It's crazy how some stocks can make a run like that in the otc and still be up that much a year later, that's the crazy part.

1605 2018-02-04 02:54:26 Obviously, the relationship is not perfect and I don't see US stocks coming down for several weeks.
1606 2018-02-04 02:54:03 How to Handle correction 

*Sell off poor quality stuff on next bounce
*Have some Cash
*Prepare a watchlist of quality stocks esp large midcap/largecaps
*Don’t rush to buy. 
*Buy in three installments
1607 2018-02-04 02:52:16 Just to add to it, if the trend holds, US stocks will rise again next week, and then drop, chashing the Cushing stocks down.

1610 2018-02-04 02:48:09 Yes, indeed. And parabolic is really a mislabeling. A parabola is a conical section, which encompasses 360 degrees. If, say, stocks did that, it would mean they traded at two radically different prices at the same time. Bah, humbug!
1611 2018-02-04 02:47:34 Those who invest/invested Rs.5 lakhs and more  in stocks for long term and expect return more than 20% p.a. ONLY  should worry about LTCG #100000 #MiddleClass

1614 2018-02-04 02:45:49 It is directly his fault.  The memo release caused it.  I said months ago stocks WILL crash,.... Due to trump and trump alone.

1621 2018-02-04 02:32:12 To those that asked me about the previous caratland bracelet. I am currently away until Tuesday so i wouldn’t be able to check on the stocks now
1622 2018-02-04 02:32:02 I agree that it's undervalued. One of the reasons that this stock is down is that bitcoin making new lows. Look at $RIOT $MARA $MGTI $NETE $OTIV $SRAX $SIEB $SSC $DPW. They're crypto-related stocks that cracked hard.

1624 2018-02-04 02:31:23 But there is a time to be in stocks… and a time to be out of them. Without knowing the future, you can still know when something is not normal. And when something is not normal… it is just biding its time until it becomes normal again.
1625 2018-02-04 02:31:09 I’m about to invest in stocks on u niggas.
1626 2018-02-04 02:30:44 Omg!  Such drama. Liberals are triggered so easily. It's been going up for 12 straight months and takes one hit and you think your onto something. Do you invest in stocks?  Do you have a job with a 401K?  Didn't think so.  Go back to la la  land dingbat
1627 2018-02-04 02:28:21 If you are in mutual funds your investment managers will reallocate for you. Yield stocks are being sold off for bonds. I moved to growth stocks when Trump won;-) Low taxes and a reduced regulatory environment will increase a broad spectrum of stocks. Stay away from Cos with debt
1628 2018-02-04 02:28:21 When it rose it was Obama’s stocks.  When it falls it’s Trumps!  Right?  That’s how all this works?  When something good happens it’s because of the terrorist, and when something bad happens it’s because a mean man in the White House says things that hurt feelings...
1629 2018-02-04 02:27:01 THATS WHILE THE STOCKS MARKET HIT ITS LOWER POINT IN 2 YEARS
1630 2018-02-04 02:24:19 Oh look an SJW bot that knows how to push the gif button. You clearly know as much about stocks as you do politics. You're still riding the drunken, broken down Hillary wagon? Be a leader, ditch Hillary like the rest of the world and jump on the Oprah2020 train lol.

If a guy wanted to short aao, why not let it run up a bit first.  Again, defies logic.

You'd do better going long, imo.

1649 2018-02-04 02:05:11 The Stock Market is an illusion built on empty promises & not much more reliable than buying a lottery ticket. The only people guaranteed to make money are the people selling the tickets & stocks, the people who know it's a house of cards built on a foundation of pure bullshit.
1650 2018-02-04 02:04:11 Where exactly is the pain? The pain is ppl earning in stocks OR revenue generation. If revenue generation, sell off some stakes in govt Co. Privatization infact does better than govt hold eg nalco, maruti. Seems that is not the case. The pain is how can indians earn in stocks?
1651 2018-02-04 02:03:27 Me too!
1652 2018-02-04 02:01:24 Trying to adult by buying stocks but I honestly don’t know how they work LOL 
1653 2018-02-04 02:00:49 Res PM, Indian capital markets just artificial Index up  by jack up price of few stock and by speculation loots by tool of options.
Long term helps  keep valuation high of stocks. Sebi should ask to mutual fund to invest10% fund in mid cap stock to solid real growth of stocks mkt
1654 2018-02-04 02:00:45 From what I’ve been lead to understand as long as those things are tight in their stocks it doesn’t really matter in regards to free float. Something about loaded tension.
1655 2018-02-04 01:59:23 really.......when it was Dow 6,575 in 2009 w 11% unemployment/ 13 million homeowners in foreclosure/ $18Trillion in wealth wiped out/ bankruptcies spiking...... sure seemed stocks were reflecting the US economy.
1656 2018-02-04 01:58:02 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.

1658 2018-02-04 01:57:36 I'm not into stocks or anything like that. But, if I was to buy stock I'll put my money on toothpaste and toilet paper.
1659 2018-02-04 01:55:57 "penny stocks are trash"
1660 2018-02-04 01:55:16 It’s all the same. Bitcoin is more volatile but still has its rewards. Stocks are all a risk and it’s your money, invest how you want.

1666 2018-02-04 01:49:54 I do. And I have a little. But its not a stable market. 2 guys were able to manipulate the market to get it to 1k. There is never a way to get a tangible bitcoin. You can compare it to stocks but those are based on a company.
1667 2018-02-04 01:49:17 So put $400M in bonds and see if you can beat the market with the other $100M... statistics say no... and if you do win in stocks... you still only be "rich"... your life will not change...
1668 2018-02-04 01:46:40 That's why treasury rates are going higher, causing stocks to go lower. Eventually that can cause a recession.
1669 2018-02-04 01:46:19 @AnnabelleTrader  Anna Belle, do you know anyone who is really good trading gold stocks, long and short?

Ideally an Ann pre-open tomorrow would be saucy.
1671 2018-02-04 01:44:46 You may find some disagreement on that point from auto manufacturers desperate to move repos and 2017 inventory, and the would-be purchasers of those vehicles now unable to do so on account of maxed out consumer credit and totally depleted savings.

1674 2018-02-04 01:43:49 Doesn’t tax benefits expire in two years for normal folks but not for the super rich & big corps? Of course poor people can count on all the dividends from their stock portfolios. Doesn’t everybody have stocks, bonds & capital gains?
1675 2018-02-04 01:43:43 A lot of things are wrong with this. These people should be buying stocks instead of screwing up the chances for people who actually want a shoe.
1676 2018-02-04 01:43:24 How I judge credibility: if someone has suspenders, glasses that cover half of their face, invests in low risk stocks and has potential heart disease they probably know what they’re talking about.
1677 2018-02-04 01:43:22 I think 25% is a bit much. Don’t get me wrong I am bullish on solid crypto projects but I think a wiser thing would be something in the range of 15-18% in crypto and 7-10% in stocks like Tesla, oil and marijuana are a better spread.
1678 2018-02-04 01:43:10 Hey @realDonaldTrump can u please talk to sessions about easing up on the federal marijuana stance? I dont use the stuff, but hes killing my pot stocks! Hey how about u go fed legal & use the tax rev to fund the wall?? Win-win!

1681 2018-02-04 01:41:06 Sa stocks nila the 2017 ay down sila I had it checked sa friend ko who works in Wall Street here in New York it started as 9 I’m not sure if this is pesos or dollars but now it’s 5 Ibig sabihin maraming nag pull out ng share nila So don’t be surprise one of these days bankrupt
1682 2018-02-04 01:40:31 Hey, did ya notice our stocks dropped like 2.5% yesterday? That’s all on you!
1683 2018-02-04 01:40:12 he doesn't even get the correct facts on job numbers, minimum wages, and the $$ lost on stocks yesterday.
1684 2018-02-04 01:40:09 When the stocks are up I'm in a great mood when they are down I'm pissed at everybody 
1685 2018-02-04 01:39:47 Verizon and the republicans announced they are giving stocks and bonus - but not until 2019!!  What a crock of horse 
1686 2018-02-04 01:38:36 They kept it under their hats for the safety of the nation and so they could make sure they had all the facts! What do you know about democracy, you're aiming for a DICTATORSHIP! YOU ARE A DISGRACE!Oh ya,how about the drop in stocks this week,wonder how that happened?
1687 2018-02-04 01:36:39 Way to go dotard - stocks have tumbled more than 650 points since your SOTU address. Why don't you just resign and go back to Russia.
1688 2018-02-04 01:35:53 All of them are expirenced player
But Indian condition are different 20-20 don't have much time stocks can hit harder .

Not in the list. 
Last year domestic level super perfomence.
He can hit like a master. 
Wishing the best RR got run machine.
1689 2018-02-04 01:33:53 I run 5 screens from Marketsmith.  Put them in a Master List. Sorted by Group Rank 1st.  % off High 2nd. Cut out the junk, and send list to VIP Members. Then, I go thru list, pick out my favorites, put on Key List that I send to VIP members each night. With video also  #stocks
1690 2018-02-04 01:33:28 I do respect your optimism but can't be excited to buy now when the market is going to continue to suffer more losses. Also and unfortunately a lot of hard working Americans still getting by may not have $ to buy stocks.
1691 2018-02-04 01:33:28 There is collusion. You prove it every day. And you don't ever tell the complete picture. Many losing jobs, many closing down. Oh, and BTW, stocks are going down. Why aren't you tweeting about that???
1692 2018-02-04 01:32:44 Yeah? All investor's to Clinton Foundation dumping their stocks and bonds getting the hell out of town!
1693 2018-02-04 01:32:32 Anyone else with investments in CAD stocks notice a BIG drop in value this week?
Is this the big reset year where CAD companies become so uncompetitive their stock becomes worthless? #Cdnpoli
1694 2018-02-04 01:31:58 Can you still correct errors in a decentralized structure? Let's say a clerk misstypes and sends stocks / tokens to wrong person. Can you correct this?
1695 2018-02-04 01:27:52 Bought at 10c, sold at 40c. Had my finger on the sell button five minutes after I bought at 10, never felt comfortable with it. It jumped up me and I let it ride. Sold a few weeks later for a 4x return. Doubt it bounces back when MJ stocks recover.
1696 2018-02-04 01:25:58 All depends if people keep treating cryptocurrency like stocks or start using them xvg has a lot of online stores that accepts xvg so only time will tell if people would put their money into the coin and hold it and use it or just sell it for fiat profit
1697 2018-02-04 01:24:49 Several of our parents are financial advisors.    I really need a bit of advice about IRA's,  stocks etc.

1698 2018-02-04 01:23:06 Expecting a few Pump n Dumps on Penny Stocks as a sea of green gives unsuspecting people a false sense of security.

1699 2018-02-04 01:22:41 lot of people are trying to find justifications for why the market should rise again. A correction is a market behaviour Deal with it #Budget2018 #markets #stocks #StockMarket
1700 2018-02-04 01:21:24 Even @jimcramer got this one correct 10-15 years ago (saw it on TV)... stocks are for those who want to get rich... treasuries are for those who are already rich...
1701 2018-02-04 01:19:52 Thank you President Trump! unemployment at an all time! low! record breaking stocks! Jobs pouring in! The awesome tax cuts!! to name a few.
1702 2018-02-04 01:18:32 We're  lucky as hell that hag didn't become president. We're a ton better off a year after the election than we were under the last admin. Just look at your 401ks, IRA's, stocks & bonds Oh & paychecks.. If your against all that, be sure to write the Treasury a monthly check
1703 2018-02-04 01:18:13 FWIW, I see the opposite, from that graph.  Elasticity is not 1:1, but the trend is set by Cushing.  Last rise in US ttl stocks can be seen in history of Cushing.  To my read (of this chart, if it is predictive) says US ttl is to drop further, until Cushing shows a reversal.
1704 2018-02-04 01:18:06 In Rodinal yes, but I normally push stuff that fogs like mad in HC110 stand and it works much better than Rodinal with such stocks. That’s fresh stuff tho ...
1705 2018-02-04 01:17:06 Jacob, with all your clever knowledge about stocks can you tell me why the Dow has had a  MASSIVE FALL?
1706 2018-02-04 01:15:58 Stocks ended sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 600 points. 666 to be exact: the mark of the devil and exactly what you are.  EVIL.
1707 2018-02-04 01:15:39 Bah details! In the meantime stocks of companies in'defense' soar. No one is interested in American interest while they can serve their special interest

1712 2018-02-04 01:12:00 You should do better with gun control as well. I think there have been more lives lost due to assault rifles and bump stocks.
1713 2018-02-04 01:10:37 Very insightful article. I've been subjected to many stocks that have been affected by these practices. Please take the time to fill out the survey to put a stop to this . Reimplement the uptick rule ...

1717 2018-02-04 01:06:50 I invested $6000.00 in stocks Friday.

1719 2018-02-04 01:06:06 Although Democrats have opposed him every step of the way, President Trump is making our country great again. Stocks are at an all-time high, unemployment is at a 17-year low, and jobs are coming back to America!
1720 2018-02-04 01:05:03 Just like stocks, the best time to buy is in a dip. Sell beforehand. Too bad I don't know enough about cryptocurrency to do that.
1721 2018-02-04 01:04:10 said that lowering the cost of prescription drugs was his top priority, the stocks of Pharmacy Benefit Mangers (the middle men who get rebates from drug companies for placing their drugs on insurance formulates and for adjudicating insurance claims at drug stores) tanked. 
1722 2018-02-04 01:01:39 See them stocks and bitcoin plummeting...thats why I trade
1723 2018-02-04 01:01:31 If money is more important to you than stopping white supremists,religious bigots and sexual assault (and you're one of the minority of Americans with significant  $ in stocks)- than this is great news.

If you're Heather Heyers loved one, not so much.
1724 2018-02-04 01:00:54 Stocks fell 666 on Friday.
1725 2018-02-04 01:00:04 and 4) overpriced at 20k

whens the last time stocks lost 60% of their value?
1726 2018-02-04 00:59:57 when people sell their stocks and make money from the sale they have to pay Capital Gains Tax.  A sell off will help pay down the deficit.
1727 2018-02-04 00:59:02 Agree except for your stock market comment. Stocks generally go higher or lower based on greed, fear, or simple profit taking. This was profit taking...

1729 2018-02-04 00:57:20 Isn’t that crazy? Then they upped the cost of using payphones- final nail. I had a Timex Datalink Watch (a PDA- it was cool!), then a Timex “Internet Messenger Watch”, a pager that also accepted texts and gave weather, news, stocks,  sports. I LOST BOTH!!! No!!!
1730 2018-02-04 00:56:57 Honestly the people who get burnt are the people who panic sell. Sure, way more volatile than stocks but you can do moderate amounts of technical analysis.
1731 2018-02-04 00:55:58 Well, if only @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @AhmedDHussen @HonJohnMcCallum felt the same way & weren't soliciting easy #QIIP & #10YearUnlimitedVisas which are both damaging & insane. Wasn't long ago, housing & citizenship wasn't sold like penny stocks
1732 2018-02-04 00:54:40 Delusional Donny - where is your usual comment about stocks? Now that the Obama effect is wearing off, you won't have any other things to brag about soon.

THANKS OBAMA!
1733 2018-02-04 00:53:11 Things that will happen in the coming week. 1.Government shutdown 
2. Stocks keep falling 
3. No DACA deal 
4. No Wall
5. The Memo
And with all this the world is not coming to an end. And the American people will have to set though all this BS going on. Donald Trump is POTUS.MAGA

1736 2018-02-04 00:46:09 It most probably is scaring the shit out of him. (just the big Corperations taking Profits. Pushes the stock price down, they use that money to buy the stocks back at a lesser price. Witch starts moving the stock price up. When they can get 2-3% profit again, they sell) Dm smart
1737 2018-02-04 00:45:52 Also my rum stocks abysmally low. Need to rectify this in the morning....
1738 2018-02-04 00:45:35 Hey @Google since you have made what a billion dollars since my last tweet and haven't answered maybe the @FTC could answer 
Why is google an allowed monopoly? 
It controls more then one area of trade? Telcom and internet
Has it hands in more through stocks and you allowed it why
1739 2018-02-04 00:44:41 LMAO, and that is why the stocks closed down by 666 points yesterday, you know the day they released that memo of no important facts.
1740 2018-02-04 00:44:38 All they want to talk about is the worst week for stocks in years.
1741 2018-02-04 00:43:56 It's probably because Obama did better. Just guessing though. Maybe they're concerned about the worst week in stocks in years?  Or maybe they have Stormy on their mind?  Nobody though?  Surely your base spewing lies from their shitholes.
1742 2018-02-04 00:43:50 In a bear market nearly every stock goes down. In a bull market not all stocks advance. Did we just open the door to a bear market this week?
1743 2018-02-04 00:42:50 I’m talking SOG as an area from GGB to QCS. They don’t make it through that. They don’t make it through DI. And, this is one small bit of science, no secret there is much more that supports the facts. The correlation between fish farm presence and declining salmon stocks is clear

1749 2018-02-04 00:38:31 Hmmmm stocks crashing
1750 2018-02-04 00:36:54 It was exactly like that in 2008, banks/speculants (Dem. party exclusive donors) have sold stocks en masse(stupity or purpose), the next administration blamed it on Bush for 8 years and gave the idiots actually responsible for the meltdown 750 billions out of taxpayer money.
1751 2018-02-04 00:35:31 The drop in the stock market for the week was 6%. It had risen above its trend line and now is back in the line, not under. It’s where it’s supposed to be. Politics has nothing to do with stock prices. Not good for the investor who started buying stocks last week.
1752 2018-02-04 00:34:56 What's to talk about? Stock markets hate higher wages – Too too shamefully greedy – Don't want higher wages for workers. Dow Jones dropped 666 points on wage news. Republicans love stocks & hate wages. So so sad for workers and everyone. @realDonaldTrump
1753 2018-02-04 00:34:06 Dollar dropping and people rush to buy international stocks before it costs too much, growth under expected, African American unemployment up, higher wages mostly due to blue states pushing higher state minimum wages. Dow Jones drops 666 in one day.
1754 2018-02-04 00:33:23 @MartinSLewis Hi Martin. I'm about to transfer my stocks LISA into a cash LISA, then transfer my Help to buy ISA into the cash LISA. Does the year-long wait before I'm allowed to use LISA to buy a house start from when I opened the first LISA or will it start from this one?
1755 2018-02-04 00:33:15 FAKE NEWS!!!  Im still waiting for my increase in pay. Hasn't happened yet. What about the Stocks dropping?  People are now going to see allnof your lies and you cant blame the Democrats. Dont forget the country runs out of money this week. You are going to force the Gov AGAIN!!!
1756 2018-02-04 00:32:52 Y’all have fun with the Super Bowl imma be daytrading pizza stocks all day 
1757 2018-02-04 00:32:39 I'm well aware of your point. It's just a bad one. Pretending a bump stock ban does anything other than further restrict gun rights is silly. Bump stocks have been used in exactly one crime and are easily replicable.
1758 2018-02-04 00:32:30 Been saying it would for months.  Stock Market pull out for Profit. Majority of stocks owned by rich & People living in other countries.
1759 2018-02-04 00:32:15 PUT #GOT7 SONGS ON SPOTIFY AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THERE LOTS OF STOCKS FOR THEM WHETHER ALBUMS OR MERCH #TwitterBestFandom #TeamGOT7
1760 2018-02-04 00:31:35 Your the idiot. The stock market has been over 21,000 when liberals that u rely on said it would crash below 18,000 if trump won. Who cares if the stocks go up or down a little as long as it’s over 21,000 it’s always going to be above anything the Democrats ever predicted
1761 2018-02-04 00:31:30 The tax scam was basically the red way of raising minimum wage at the lowest level to make sure stocks could rise by the ensured future of the poor having enough to buy necessities. While making them poorer by forced elimination of all programs to help them with no budget.
1762 2018-02-04 00:31:21 You clearly know zero about stocks or the market. I wouldn’t comment about things you know zero about.
1763 2018-02-04 00:31:11 GDP 5.4%  for President Trump Obummer never even hit 3.0 GDP the only President in history never to hit 3.0 GDP.  Stocks are different now
1764 2018-02-04 00:31:06 Stocks are crazy right now 
1765 2018-02-04 00:31:02 And they bought those fucking stocks to protest Henry being added to the group. That will never not make me angry.

1775 2018-02-04 00:21:45 What really sucks is GOP forgot to mention possibility of interest rate hike from fed to balance $ out do to stocks and pay raises etc to avoid inflation backlash due to this wonderful tax scam, SOB's !!!  Basically in 3 years on annual taxes you be paying that back 5X
1776 2018-02-04 00:21:31 Is it time to get out of stocks and go to cash?
1777 2018-02-04 00:17:11 Although Democrats have opposed him every step of the way, President Trump is making our country great again. Stocks are at an all-time high, unemployment is at a 17-year low, and jobs are coming back to America.
1778 2018-02-04 00:16:19 @PRyan Koch Bros donated you $500K along with monies from other oligarchs! CEOs are buying back stocks to increase values so their stock options compared to $1.50 per hour raise which is crumbs. As a fed retiree I received $1.00 per hr raise! CRUMBS!
1779 2018-02-04 00:16:15 SIP will be the best option in this situations... ofcourse one should have cash as backup.. 

If not just watch till tide turns positive, Analysts will start with buy commentary and when there is 1st upside tick.. enter during that time and add stocks in good quantity....
1780 2018-02-04 00:16:05 Healthy correction is right. Many saw this coming... looking at the charts it is normal, this is how the market behaves. It doesn’t go up forever. And most cannabis stocks are still way up from Nov 1st prices ...
1781 2018-02-04 00:14:29 Naturally. Stocks adjust to the dollar. An upward move in the dollar is reflected in shareholders' holdings. Always has. Why, or better yet, how may this not be so?
1782 2018-02-04 00:14:29 Most of the right doesn’t know the stock market is not an indicator of the economy.  So to paint the left as clueless is just as stupid as to say you don’t know why the market drops and rises. If you are fortunate enough to own stocks....great for you.  Doesn’t mean jack to some
1783 2018-02-04 00:13:44 It's called a stock market correction. And it was well overdue. 

Has nothing to do with the Memo. That's absurd. 

Nobody is trading stocks on the fbi memo...

1788 2018-02-04 00:09:34 Interesting. Is this a common strategy not just on TSLA but other stocks with earnings as well?
1789 2018-02-04 00:08:21 Don't worry - SOROS will sell his stocks from fake news media networks, FB, Twitter, Google & Yahoo to bankroll the Dems for the 2018 elections. Saudi, Russia and Iran will kick in a few million as well 
1790 2018-02-04 00:07:38 Is it a coincidence that stocks plummet after Trump's first State of the Union?

1793 2018-02-04 00:06:15 I didn’t realize everyone has a ‘cause’ to defend on Twitter.  As you can deduct, it’s silly to follow me.  I really can’t imagine why you and others waste your time.  No influence on stocks.  With that said, I suggest let sleeping dogs lie.
1794 2018-02-04 00:05:16 Uh it is a little more complicated than that Sarah. The trillion dollar debt is already draining the Treasury. Your bond market is bottoming it is eco 101 the stocks follow bonds hence down 2% most since 2016. Hold on because you are going to see the Fed raise rates in March
1795 2018-02-04 00:04:39 There was a huge sell off by liberals to simulate a "crash" they buy their stocks back at a lower rate and make money. Don't be an idiot.
1796 2018-02-04 00:04:06 HAHAHAHAH katung giingon gani ni ching nga namaligya? Naa na iyang stocks ahahhaaha dali-a lagi nako naka order

1798 2018-02-04 00:02:03 I started blaming Russian Oligarchs for selling off stocks on Friday. Got a few agreement tweets!
1799 2018-02-04 00:00:38 Do you buy your stocks on your smart phone? How many trades do you average per month?
1800 2018-02-03 23:58:08 @realDonaldTrump where is the usual economy is showing and stocks are soaring tweets at today
1801 2018-02-03 23:57:39 Says every wall street douche. If you trade Weed stocks and claim Bitcoin is in bubble, you are more stupid then your profile pic let’s on.
1802 2018-02-03 23:57:19 That's right and "stocks" are for 60+ years who still read newspapers 
1803 2018-02-03 23:55:15 Likelihood tips- "When you're a star, they let you do it." "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters."
Hell-freezer stocks will soar. #trumpRyanNunes #trumpRussia #diversion
1804 2018-02-03 23:52:49 I can see Fed massively pumping QE harder, creating inflation & letting USD devalue hard to erode value of debt. At the same time they need to protect tax receipts which is heavily reliant on the stock market returns. Devaluin of $ + inflation would push stocks to meteoric lvls
1805 2018-02-03 23:52:05 And as soon as Congress keeps its promise from several months ago to ban bump stocks.

1807 2018-02-03 23:50:23 You are the one who made the assertions; provide evidence for any of them.  Carrier closing the facility that Trump claimed was saved.  Sam's Club stores closing.  No evidence of any investment in the economy; buying back stocks and increasing dividends is *not* investment.
1808 2018-02-03 23:49:16 The stocks are going to tumble, what OBAMA made Trump is going to ruin.
1809 2018-02-03 23:48:49 The pound has crashed. British stocks are surprisingly cheap. One of our biggest British tech companies is now owned entirely by a Japanese investment company.

All of OBAMAs work in getting this economy and jobs growing to date. Trump in one year is going to tear it down. Watch the stocks start tumbling.

Currently most stocks noticed with indecision in #PSX #KSE100 – Encourage for entries on triggers only
1814 2018-02-03 23:44:11 That's what stocks does, up and down!
Hellooo, you think stocks go up just straigh????
1815 2018-02-03 23:43:24 It had to happen. Stocks have gone up and up and to keep inflation from going up the federal reserve has raised their interest rates. It may cost a little more to borrow money, the time being. Stocks have gone down a little but if you have bonds, they will go up. Asked my hubby.
1816 2018-02-03 23:43:11 I don't think anyone did. I think the rates will correct next week and meander for a few weeks/months before breaking really breaking out. Doesn't mean stocks will surge though, even if credit spread is still pretty healthy.

1818 2018-02-03 23:58:08 @realDonaldTrump where is the usual economy is showing and stocks are soaring tweets at today
1819 2018-02-03 23:57:39 Says every wall street douche. If you trade Weed stocks and claim Bitcoin is in bubble, you are more stupid then your profile pic let’s on.
1820 2018-02-03 23:57:19 That's right and "stocks" are for 60+ years who still read newspapers 
1821 2018-02-03 23:55:15 Likelihood tips- "When you're a star, they let you do it." "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters."
Hell-freezer stocks will soar. #trumpRyanNunes #trumpRussia #diversion
1822 2018-02-03 23:52:49 I can see Fed massively pumping QE harder, creating inflation & letting USD devalue hard to erode value of debt. At the same time they need to protect tax receipts which is heavily reliant on the stock market returns. Devaluin of $ + inflation would push stocks to meteoric lvls
1823 2018-02-03 23:52:05 And as soon as Congress keeps its promise from several months ago to ban bump stocks.

1839 2018-02-03 23:38:53 Well Obama, coming from a republican, was successful. Economic growth almost doubled its pace and his administration saved the car industry. Every statistic trump is throwing out is due to a trend started by Obama(black unemployment trend started in 2010, stocks trend was 2008.)
1840 2018-02-03 23:38:07 Woop  yes Stocks!  #KRO
1841 2018-02-03 23:34:41 What was the difference between house market and what happened i.e 1929 and in 2008 induced by fictive houseprices but stocks took a hard hit aswell. I guarantee that you can't predict next falling down in stockmarket.
1842 2018-02-03 23:34:30 MA 20 50 100 200
EMA 4 and 8 
Are what I use for stocks.
1843 2018-02-03 23:34:30 And major stocks down plus housing prices down. Less rules and regulations under republican law leads to the collapse just in 2008/2009
1844 2018-02-03 23:32:23 Portfolio declined over 8% in last 1 week.  This is the biggest decline seen in over 2 years in a week. 

Stock market is a great teacher and can play havoc with your psychology. It tests your philosophy and questions your wisdom. 

Holding quality stocks and concentrated pf.
1845 2018-02-03 23:32:07 What people didn't really expect was all these employee bonuses injecting money directly into the economy and that could be inflationary." So, they expected people to go buy stocks, not Costco memberships with their vast 1.50 a week increase?
1846 2018-02-03 23:31:17 Im holding all. Until recently all of my investments have been long term. I believe andi is good long or short term so im staying for the long term ride. I have a handfull of stocks to flip if im lucky enough!
1847 2018-02-03 23:29:42 Sex doll stocks keep rising
1848 2018-02-03 23:29:27 @TheLeadCNN Keep an eye on Russians dumping stocks. ,on Futures. it is at 729 now. That will force Mueller to have to indict Trump and cut the stocks . and freeze Russian accts. that is what is important here.
1849 2018-02-03 23:29:27 2/ the minimal intrusion on an unobstructed 2cnd amendment right like banning bump stocks and back ground Checks at gun shows is a price I’m willing to pay. I’m done with this argument.
1850 2018-02-03 23:28:53 Damn,that’s just not right.Gotta b some place that stocks up via donations for situations like this,no? You’d know better than I would so if you’re saying there isn’t any then that’s truly unfortunate.Everyone should have the basics,especially in this extreme weather! @doniveson
1851 2018-02-03 23:27:48 Stocks go up and down daily. Even after the drop it's still higher than it was. 3% GDP for Trump in his first year. Obama had 32 quarters during his presidency and never hit 3% once. Fact! Look it up
1852 2018-02-03 23:27:21 The time is most ripe to buy technology, defense and pharmaceutical stocks.
1853 2018-02-03 23:26:39 What about ride share every modern  advanced city has ride share, except Vancouver. Protecting taxi is not good they should be treated like any other business in bc. If there price goes down it was up to the owener they thought this price would stay stable. Its like stocks.
1854 2018-02-03 23:25:51 These stocks wont go up anymore on licences and facility being done now. Get out while you can
1855 2018-02-03 23:25:49 My ongoing watchlist flourishes at the intersection of tradable liquidity and top 20% of 3-month volatility and a history of sweet swings. 4 stocks were green Friday... out of 58. $spy

1858 2018-02-03 23:23:53 And the idea of any age group actually  “embracing” it is a big leap. The number of millennials who own any bitcoin as opposed to cash, stocks, or bonds is miniscule.
1859 2018-02-03 23:23:30 Ooooh you're so fickle! Does Eden know?!
1860 2018-02-03 23:22:11 #cryptocurrency haters are missing a rather obvious point. Even despite the recent massacre, I'm still WAY up on my crypto investments. If these were stocks would still be the best investment I made in 2017. #notworried #HODL
1861 2018-02-03 23:21:50 Don't forget 0.1%'s cap gains as permanent corporate tax rate reduction flows through to shareholders.  About half of US households don't own stocks.
1862 2018-02-03 23:18:26 Invest in stocks 2019.
1863 2018-02-03 23:18:25 Thank you. It's a shame that you debit credit cards straight away despite there being no stocks available and obtaining a refund seems to be such a battle. Shockingly bad service.
1864 2018-02-03 23:16:50 No one seems very worried about the selloff Friday in the $SPY and other indexes. Wouldn’t be surprised to see some follow through Monday as markets rarely bottom on a Friday and then see a rally back as the fact that there’s still no where else to invest sets in #stocks #market
1865 2018-02-03 23:16:26 According to an article in the #NewYorkTimes stocks have now dropped by 2 percent, leading to the stock market to its worst week in over two years. We will wait to see what happens next but a boom looks unlikely.
1866 2018-02-03 23:16:22 Thanks chlo 
1867 2018-02-03 23:16:04 Half of #Americans don’t even own stocks. How well the market is doing is irrelevant for them: they are no better off financially.  #GOP gave permanent HUGE #taxcuts to enormously wealthy ppl & a small, temporary tax cut to the rest of us. #Unfair!
1868 2018-02-03 23:15:41 Investing my refund in stocks forsure
1869 2018-02-03 23:13:14 I should just accept the fact that my bestfriend isn’t going to accept any guy in my life until she meets him multiple times
1870 2018-02-03 23:12:37 This is still a bull market for there’s nothing scaring investors in the long term. New opportunities to grab as stocks dip. What goes up must come down. Low interest rates and low inflation with jobs creating offers hope to investors. The tax cuts will make investors happy.
1871 2018-02-03 23:11:49 U know crumbs means “minimal” in this context. Wow a whole $1.50 more a week? This will greatly enhance my IRA...college fund.....get me out of debt...erase my car payment...buy stocks... NOT!!!!!!!!

1884 2018-02-03 23:05:01 Is it time to sell our stocks?
1885 2018-02-03 23:03:59 Aren’t something like 84% of all stocks owed by the richest 10% of all households? Is there really anything new here with #crypto ?
1886 2018-02-03 23:03:35 yeah Stephen you are right - someone purposefully bought and sold stocks in the exact fashion needed to have the Dow drop exactly 666 points - is that what you are saying?
1887 2018-02-03 23:03:33 i just played a 99-stock fox ditto vs a 20xx cpu and my hands dont even hurt that much

won by 34 stocks which is alright
1888 2018-02-03 23:03:33 Called a correction. That’s a technical term by the way. And by the way, the new tax law will help big businesses keep their stocks up.
1889 2018-02-03 23:01:41 Alabama 68, Florida 50. Anyone who can accurately predict Alabama basketball this season should be buying stocks. Nevertheless #RollTide #BuckleUp and #Bama beats another ranked team
1890 2018-02-03 23:00:32 Its called conditioning. If you want others to control your money and pay dearly for it, invest in stocks. Support the companies that treat you like crap and will never pay you enough. Don’t buy from local owned small business or decentralized currencies.
1891 2018-02-03 22:58:43 This is when amateur investors panic!  Me, I buy more stocks in companies with a proven track record and huge potential.
1892 2018-02-03 22:58:18 “… or 665.75… Be not afraid of rounding… Also ‘number of a man’ refers to stocks. Obviously.” - Revelation 13:18 (draft)
1893 2018-02-03 22:58:06 Obviously you have no investments in stocks...at least not in the US stock market.

1896 2018-02-03 22:56:39 Problem is, they really don't understand it at all.  Normally when CNBC starts to go crazy (like on stocks) it is the bottom!  When they get bullish (sell).  I have 20 years on WS remembering alot of bad calls.  They don't have the time to really research.
1897 2018-02-03 22:55:59 From 11-9-16 to Now the stocks have rose. So a small dip. It would take a lot to get back to Obama's era.
1898 2018-02-03 22:52:05 If $SPX closes lower on Monday than it did on Friday (2762.13), historical odds favor a green Tuesday (81% of the time, with an average return of +1.4%). Keep in mind the exceptions are brutal (-2.5%, -1.9%, -2.7%, -1.4%).

1899 2018-02-03 22:50:46 In the Sector Trend Trading account, I moved up the stops on three stocks this weekend. $AMAT to $49.00, $LRCX to $173.02, and $AAPL to $155.30. First three adjustments based on 3 red arrows on weekly charts for all 3 of these stocks.

1905 2018-02-03 22:46:00 Conventional advice doesn't apply as well with pot stocks though.
1906 2018-02-03 22:45:53 If you’re wondering if stocks and bonds can go through sustained periods of positive correlation, check out the 1970s through the 1990s.
1907 2018-02-03 22:45:38 yeah, i've been trying to figure out how to scrape for RPM and NBA stats tracking data to test some other theories, but interestingly when i isolated the offensive & defensive components of Jacob's data, stocks had a much much more significant offensive impact than defensive.
1908 2018-02-03 22:44:08 "...mistakenly evaluate stocks individually rather than as part of a portfolio" reminded me of reading about a company CEO (as portfolio mgr) wanting his business VPs to take more risks, but they can be risk/loss averse-probably because failure can derail one's career trajectory

1911 2018-02-03 22:41:58 As ppl sell their stocks to buy cars and houses...lots of weather disasters in US recently n they need the money. US Government made $80M off the sales which President Trump   will probably use to pay off National debt. It's OK buying/selling is good 
1912 2018-02-03 22:41:56 Schools, universities and colleges need the be cleansed of socialist ideology. That’s a start. Popular culture spokesperson(s) need to start slowly introducing Hillary and Obama as guilty.  Make them laughing stocks in popular culture and it’s over.
1913 2018-02-03 22:41:43 @BillOReilly call me Naïve… But why did the stocks drop so suddenly?
1914 2018-02-03 22:40:50 Inwieweit beeinflusst das die Länge des Stocks?
1915 2018-02-03 22:40:21 Been trying to learn more about stocks but really struggling
1916 2018-02-03 22:37:45 The stock market fluctuates. Especially when investors take their money when stocks are high.  Some  liberal uber rich with millions of shares, will sell at a loss, taking only a small profit.  This way they can influence the political arena by dropping the stock prices.
1917 2018-02-03 22:37:29 You need to learn to read! The stock market dropped because the bond market went up...why? Because the economy is on fire and the fed is worried about inflation so they are projecting rate increases! Take your $ out of stocks and put some in bonds!
1918 2018-02-03 22:36:53 I really want to start buying stocks this year
1919 2018-02-03 22:35:49 Not all stocks are created equal.   Gotta do the work my friend.  I know you will.
1920 2018-02-03 22:35:38 I still can’t get over him telling everyone to sell all their stocks.  

That might be the worst tweet of all time
1921 2018-02-03 22:34:44 Stocks gon crash

1924 2018-02-03 22:33:41 Gold, stocks and mutual funds are also not legal tender. And, they have been here for a long time now. 
Dear Media, you're all sold out and that was evident when you broadcasted that crypto is banned in India. Mr. @arunjaitley never uttered the word 'BAN'. Thanks @AtrangiLekhak

1926 2018-02-03 22:28:44 I look so old that a grown ass man came up to me at the gas station, showed me the newspaper  and said “stocks are doing great am I right”
1927 2018-02-03 22:28:34 I'm am a card carrying NRA member. I wouldn't have problem regulating bump stocks, but the left wouldn't stop there.Then it will be civilian AR-15's and then it will be hand guns and next all semi automatics. The left wants to regulate everything right down to the bullets. Pass

1929 2018-02-03 22:25:40 The best way to view LTCG is as a 10% (interest free) loan on your capital gains that the govt. will give you as long (you decide the duration) as you don't sell the stocks beyond one year. Since it is a law, there is nothing else you can do about it.
1930 2018-02-03 22:23:45 Also... Why would you buy stocks / bonds then? Isn't that too scary? Why not put the money under your mattress? It's much safer.
1931 2018-02-03 22:22:40 You gotta stop. Media is laughing stocks?

I don’t think so. You really need to step out of your bubble.
1932 2018-02-03 22:22:36 I just keep coming back to fact that Ayton has worst stocks for physical tools probably ever. DeAndre Jordan and Javale closest.
1933 2018-02-03 22:22:16 What a loser! I bet you didn’t even know what 666 points in stocks mean. Dow is up points 6000 points since trump! #MAGA
1934 2018-02-03 22:19:19 let's do- earth is flat; horse and carriage; pillary (stocks) eggings.

what else went on, on and around the pillary?
1935 2018-02-03 22:19:04 2. The interest rate strongly affects stock prices listed on the stock exchange because of the impact of the financial risk factor on investors' options. The high interest rate means high returns with little risk margin through bank deposits. This is a downward pressure on stocks
1936 2018-02-03 22:18:45 Stocks plummeted yesterday. 
1937 2018-02-03 22:18:12 waiting for Ripple stocks, i would buy it...
1938 2018-02-03 22:18:08 This fortune cookie told me I would do better in real estate than in stocks, wow this cookie just answered one of my biggest problems WOW
1939 2018-02-03 22:16:12 Any stocks & trades experienced people?
1940 2018-02-03 22:15:46 @DeanHeller
We're your stocks indexed to automatically sell Friday
The markets are nervous
Big players are taking profits 
The markets are inflated and you probably consolidated your positions on at least bank and tech stocks
What stocks do you own Dean
I hope Jackie asks you
1941 2018-02-03 22:15:11 So what are your 4 stocks? I assume Amazon is one of them?

1943 2018-02-03 22:13:14 All depends on news flow right ? Stocks go up on news depending on the news . So if $mmj $cann $mym gets thier facilty completed itnwill go up if they get liscens they will go up . If they get other catalyst they will go back up. Not to new highs . But a bounce 
1944 2018-02-03 22:12:36 i love doing laundry and finding all my lighters that went missing
1945 2018-02-03 22:10:12 Fiat is a Ponzi scheme.

Central Banks print money to purchase government debt.
Keeping interest rates artificially low, corporations can issue corporate bonds to buy their own stocks to drive their share prices higher.
Cryptography is the antidote.
1946 2018-02-03 22:09:43 Check Phil Mudd's investments. I bet his defense portfolio of stocks was worth a pretty penny during the Iraq war. These neocons didn't care about innocent deaths in Iraq, they just wanted to profit from their death and destruction. In the end, their treachery will be revealed.
1947 2018-02-03 22:09:31 God I loved Dick Trickle. Stocks for Tots, about closing time, my fiancee and I stopped in one last building. Dick was sitting there and looked at his watch. He handed us autographed postcards and asked "Do you mind if I smoke?" then asked us to stand there so nobody would see.
1948 2018-02-03 22:08:37 Will the stock market continue to fall next week? #investing #trading #stocks
1949 2018-02-03 22:07:31 Much less chance of inflation increase. This economy is healthy, stocks will continually grow as they have in 2017. Talk inflation in 2020
1950 2018-02-03 22:05:55 For the record, I'm invested in stocks and crypto. I see the value in diversification, and I'm not close minded.
1951 2018-02-03 22:04:53 How much stocks you hold/own ??
1952 2018-02-03 22:04:21 i made a 1.70 off stocks idk how y’all do that 9 to 5 shit
1953 2018-02-03 22:02:55 My bad, they did not come out against bump stocks, but the are in favor of regulating them.
1954 2018-02-03 22:01:54 Looks like most stocks will give up at least a  61.88 % retracement of Januarys rally , some will give it all back $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA

1956 2018-02-03 21:57:52 One politician said they would not let the canna law go through and the price of all canna stocks dropped like crazy on the news. I wonder if all those boys shorted the crap out of all the stocks before they posted the news.
1957 2018-02-03 21:55:31 Just awesome timing when people are ready selling stocks for peanuts
They just need to see ur prediction chart.
1958 2018-02-03 21:55:15 Rich Liberals Are Dumping Stock To Diminish Trumps Victories ... Trust Me Stocks Will Rise Soon !

1962 2018-02-03 21:54:18 Stronger population in terms of warding off massive amounts of disease. Just like the more diverse a city is, the less chance the economy ranks when one of the industries hits a rough patch. Or putting your stocks in a variety of accounts instead of just one.
1963 2018-02-03 21:53:11 Called January Effect.Means the exact opposite of what you described. Stocks historically do better at end of January-if you knew anything
1964 2018-02-03 21:52:41 Do u own stocks?
1965 2018-02-03 21:50:51 Motley Foul has a "buy conviction" out on stocks quoting a 475% return on recent recommendations. Place your bets wisely now cuz the casino owners are getting greedier every day.
1966 2018-02-03 21:50:50 What a shit day for my stocks
1967 2018-02-03 21:50:03 Don’t forget to tell me more about how I can cash in from the benefits of my non-existent stocks and bonds!
1968 2018-02-03 21:49:35 Their stocks are their store of value

1977 2018-02-03 21:42:53 What blunder FM Arun Jaitly has committed in bringing back LTCG tax? Why should I retain stocks for long term if have to pay 15% for short term and 10% for long term? I will take profit at the year end.
1978 2018-02-03 21:42:51 It's time for altcoins. Bitcoin has no practical use and is way to expensive. Xrp is on it's way to the us soon. Crypto is volatile. I believe in pumping and dumping to make money and putting the proceeds into stocks.
1979 2018-02-03 21:42:48 Of course whether he did it not Fall will be good if those stocks  keep dropping though Geez! Brag on
1980 2018-02-03 21:41:02 Getting ready to play #thestockmarketgame Should be interesting Monday since stocks fell Friday! @SIFMAFoundation
1981 2018-02-03 21:40:58 complicated..

short term bad:

higher deposit rates
higher debt servicing costs

but medium term - increased disillusionment - beginning of the end for fiat + overvalued stocks

start of a revolution - been waiting 3 years.. 

interest rate rises r the catalyst..
1982 2018-02-03 21:40:57 What's funny about you dems is the Dow cruises up like crazy for an entire year after y'all say it will tank. Then you give credit to Obama, till it takes a dip then it's trumps fault. Admit it you don't know how stocks work.
1983 2018-02-03 21:40:42 Write and publish a good book 
Make music
Make a poppin youtube channel
Invest in stocks
All of those things take hard work and determination but the pay off is better than anything short term around here
1984 2018-02-03 21:39:57 You know what's unreal? My 401K gains from the past 12 months. How'd your stocks do? What, you sold everything after the election? Oh, sorry to hear that.
1985 2018-02-03 21:39:43 Lrt is he looking at stocks
1986 2018-02-03 21:39:24 This month investments will consist of silver coins/bars, more crypto, stocks and a new camera. #FINANCIALLYFOCUSED
1987 2018-02-03 21:39:04 The stock market crashed 700 points yesterday when it found out that ordinary Americans might actually be experiencing a 2.9% increase in wages.    In other words, what's good for Americans ISN'T good for the stock market.  And pricey stocks AREN'T good for working Americans.
1988 2018-02-03 21:39:00 (1) you are incorrect on the accuracy of the stock market slide. It was 665.75 (2) stocks still the HIGHEST they have ever been in HISTORY.(3) liberals have been saying “thanks Obama” for the past YEAR. Now it slides a little and you blame Trump. LIBERALS blame Trump for anything
1989 2018-02-03 21:38:24 Hey @realDonaldTrump, @POTUS, STOCKS fell 666 points yesterday. No tweets to comment?
1990 2018-02-03 21:38:12 Any person arguing in favor of bump stocks loses all credibility when supporting gun rights. Sorry, there is NO NEED for a bump stock unless you are complete dolt....

1993 2018-02-03 21:37:36 My $tbt position loves me. $spy not so much . Honestly I thought when bond yields went up stocks go up with it.
1994 2018-02-03 21:37:36 OMG ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID . that memo does not vindicate you omg you really are mental . actually it was worse for you duh absolutely the worst president ever everyone sell your stocks hurry. VOTE DEMOCRATS
1995 2018-02-03 21:36:06 Congrats to those companies! If that’s how big their tax cuts are can you imagine how much they are paying in taxes? Or how many employees they have? Or how well their stocks are doing now (which benefits those who get soc sec, or have 401ks or who work for public co)
1996 2018-02-03 21:33:36 Trying to diversify? Try these overpriced lattes stocks!
1997 2018-02-03 21:33:22 If you’re like me, then you actually enjoyed watching your own stocks plummet on Friday, just so that it would erode one of #DOTUS’ many annoying talking points... That also means that I’m clearly going NUTS and need a vaycay from politics! 
1998 2018-02-03 21:31:21 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-02, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (2/6):

2000 2018-02-03 21:29:17 Factor that effecta stocks. Thats elementary ideology.
2001 2018-02-03 21:27:15 Pot stocks and Crypto will continue to bleed in 2018. Not resources. Gold and Silver to the moon.
2002 2018-02-03 21:26:49 American workers are foolish. This Trillion Dollar Debt will kill middle and small Americans. GOP is draining treasury faster than anticipated and they will cut Programs. Stock market melting because the stocks follow the bond market Bond in big trouble losing investors to Europe
2003 2018-02-03 21:26:14 All depends on the overall pot stocks. If $weed drops further. The rest will mostly likely follow the trend until stabilizing before moving up.
2004 2018-02-03 21:25:48 @replouiegohmert Tax bill may be good 4 working families & I'm glad but not for single retired seniors on fixed income with mortgage & equity loan. I don't have 401 K or stocks. I wil pay at least $500 more tax year 2018. Why?

2007 2018-02-03 21:22:28 Why don’t you just scream “I know nothing about stocks, bonds or markets!”?
2008 2018-02-03 21:21:47 @RepMarkMeadows Tax law may help working families & I'm glad but it will cost me at least $500 for 2018.Did u forget about single retired seniors on fixed income? I don't have 401K or stocks but I have mortgage & home equity. Tax bill is biggest tax increase 4 seniors like me.
2009 2018-02-03 21:20:40 @Pretty_clinx where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2010 2018-02-03 21:20:35 @christopherbrecher haven’t looked at weekend video and I was off Friday afternoon. But I’ll probably take some profits Monday in stocks
2011 2018-02-03 21:20:27 Robin Hood is a app that let's you buy stocks for free.
2012 2018-02-03 21:19:53 Those were for stocks and news, right?
2013 2018-02-03 21:19:08 Hi Grant. I think if you have a look at the Kintama website the evidence show unequivocally that those fish are disappearing in GGB and SOG. The aquaculture industry has made a point of denying science, time to take some (not all) ownership of declining wild stocks.
2014 2018-02-03 21:19:04 I personally know of a dozen or so retail investors who have attempted to “trade” weed stocks. That typically means buying when it goes up and selling when it goes down. Complete momentum BS if you ask me.
2015 2018-02-03 21:17:57 Haven't held stocks more than one year. So far paid STT only. During bad times held stocks for more than one year in loss but sold when it comes back. Happy to pay LTCG from now on. After all this is for this Indian government who will use it wisely not like previous crap govt.
2016 2018-02-03 21:15:28 Just how like when unemployment goes up the stock prices go up because stocks are just a pure reflection of company earnings. Not the market as a whole.

2018 2018-02-03 21:14:47 The stock market isn’t a complete reflection of the economy. Wages are. As wages go up stocks are bound to waver. It’s a basic rule of stock prices. When companies earn less because they invest more in their employees via wages or bonuses the market goes down.
2019 2018-02-03 21:13:24 Crypto trade like stocks and they're great to store value long term like stocks. But you can't pay people p2p with stocks. I can't send my stock shares directly to anyone on the Internet like I can with Bitcoin #btc #cryptocurency #bitcoin
2020 2018-02-03 21:12:26 My stocks dropped 5% yesterday. Republicans, historically, are terrible for the economy.
2021 2018-02-03 21:12:07 Stocks for this prick.
2022 2018-02-03 21:10:48 Invested in some cannabis companies and the stocks aren’t doing too hot 
2023 2018-02-03 21:08:35 The reintroduction of the stocks is looking good right now.
2024 2018-02-03 21:08:20 So my penny stocks went down $7 and some change. Happy monday to you.
2025 2018-02-03 21:07:30 Agreed. I tried to point out that Wall Street is not trying to increase the economy, it tries to increase individual stocks which is not necessary good for the economy as a whole... Not a lack of understanding, a different goal

2028 2018-02-03 21:02:56 As soon as I get my money all the way right I'm investing in stocks
2029 2018-02-03 21:02:25 People tend to be wrong assuming prices only go in one direction (e.g. housing, tech stocks, and probably Bitcoin)
2030 2018-02-03 21:01:41 A preteen boy on the subway yesterday had an app called “Corporate Cannabis” and was keeping track of the stocks on it. Who raised you and where are your parents boi
2031 2018-02-03 21:00:19 Stocks for a lil bit than 3pc wheels very soon
2032 2018-02-03 20:59:47 His buddies are all laughing
At the stooges they deceived
Cause they own the companies
And their stocks are in the clouds

But at least
I’ve got my twelve bit rye
Thanks to Paul Ryan
Now I’m not afraid to die
Thanks to Paul Ryan
2033 2018-02-03 20:59:15 I'll take the stocks! :)
2034 2018-02-03 20:58:07 A few stocks/etfs/trusts removed from the weekly ACJ watchlist: $CGNX $CTRL $LRCX $SEND $STM $GBTC $MJX $ROKU
2035 2018-02-03 20:57:45 Thats not how the stock market works. There are literally millions of factors that effect it including a breakdown of individual company stocks, and the recent government shutdown backlash is catching up to us at the moment.
2036 2018-02-03 20:57:04 Stocks are a result of other things then Trump , the only thing he did was lower taxes for his own benefit not the people ,  you must be one of the ignorant ones that don't know your being fucked .
2037 2018-02-03 20:55:53 I posted about this yesterday. That stocks were going down because certain people knew they were in deep trouble. To follow the money. Also, not all the bad guys are really bad guys. Keeping everyone off balance is the key to success.
2038 2018-02-03 20:54:12 Dr. KSS:  Have followed you last 18 months at Stock Gumshoe.  Your education and guidance there have helped me to profitably invest in small biotech stocks.  I look forward to following you at Twitter or anywhere your new home may be.
2039 2018-02-03 20:53:14 @realDonaldTrump my stocks is up, thanks Mr. President!
2040 2018-02-03 20:52:39 Remember when members of Congress were attacked by a gunman last year on a softball field? One was seriously injured. Where was the outrage for assault weapons? In fact Congress is trying to make silencers and bump stocks legal? Craziness!
2041 2018-02-03 20:52:26 Of course it’s a healthy correction in the stock market. You see, the difference is that stocks and the underlying companies have an intrinsic value that they will never go under (and their fair price will always return). Zoom out even further and you’ll get some perspective.
2042 2018-02-03 20:52:07 It’s like a more liquid form of stocks .  It is even more liquid that cash
2043 2018-02-03 20:51:29 I just watched Dancer in the Dark after what... 15+ years? I'm a wreck all over again. Kleenex stocks just went up.
2044 2018-02-03 20:50:55 Obama, Hillary & the obstructionist Dems caused stocks to fall.
2045 2018-02-03 20:49:39 Crypto trade like stocks and they're great to store value long term like stocks. But you can't pay people p2p with stocks. I can't send my stock shares directly to anyone on the Internet like I can with Bitcoins.
2046 2018-02-03 20:49:33 Ignoring the fact that using that specific allocation in 1998 would have been highly unusual, can you honestly say it would have been appropriate for a retiree looking to draw income for the rest of their life to be 100% stocks?
2047 2018-02-03 20:49:01 My ST  trading plan is real simple:
 
US dollar bounce continues next week
Long DXY = short all other currencies including gold and silver
Short oil
Buy NG on pullback below 280
Bonds bounce along with DXY
Buy panics lows in US stocks Monday/Tuesday
2048 2018-02-03 20:48:35 Having fun explaining and exploring the stock market to my daughter, we just purchased our first stocks.
2049 2018-02-03 20:48:34 Stocks dip and crypto pumps. I need to wait until Monday but someone may know something we don’t 
2050 2018-02-03 20:47:32 I am pretty sure you demmocraps said the stock market was because of Obama. We all know record stocks were Trump's doing. When you hit a peak..it goes down. Common sense. Something you people lack.
2051 2018-02-03 20:46:49 It isn't their job but they do nothing to educate people about  not eating sugar which is addictive.  These big guys have money in sugar stocks,. Don't bet they don't.
2052 2018-02-03 20:46:03 I shifted my and my Mom's investments out of stocks last August when I thought they wouldn't approve changing the debt ceiling and Mueller's investigation.  Just jumped the gun.
2053 2018-02-03 20:45:19 Can't wait to trade stocks next week. Modified my strategy a bit. Did a few backtests and honing it down.
2054 2018-02-03 20:44:18 @RobinhoodApp You guys plan on launching 24 hour trading for stocks?
2055 2018-02-03 20:43:50 That’s stocks tho. Same principle. Buy low sell high.
2056 2018-02-03 20:42:23 Coming up on @TSTRealMoneyPro  on Monday morning - where we might go from here in bonds and stocks @jimcramer
2057 2018-02-03 20:41:52 The other condition is that HYG rallied throughout that period. A big driver of the break you highlight is on TLT falling faster than JNK. Your thesis may hold near-term, but higher 10yr rates will harm stocks that have deflationary-type revenues (like tech).
2058 2018-02-03 20:41:50 I can just hear him thinking, "Psych! We sure fooled you dumb Americans! We sold out last week, but don't worry, when the price of stocks have dropped sufficiently we'll buy back in again and it'll go up!"
2059 2018-02-03 20:41:40 Gross. Let him spend his remaining time in 'medieval stocks'
2060 2018-02-03 20:41:33 Well, don't stocks rise in a company who's announced a lay off as a cost savings?
2061 2018-02-03 20:41:21 I called the crash...STOCKS to follow......stocks need to crash every 8-10 years.... that's how the rich get richer!.
2062 2018-02-03 20:41:19 Let me guess - real estate is in a bubble and stocks too. Only gold isn't, right? Why does anyone buy his advice - that's all there is to it ...
2063 2018-02-03 20:40:46 instead of using our labor union's political action committee money for influence, we should be using it to buy the stocks of the corporations and eventually own them... #LongGame
2064 2018-02-03 20:40:34 That's why as you get closer to retirement the portion of  portfolio in stocks should decrease. Jogn Bogle talks about this. I favor an Australian/Singaporean style mandatory savings retirement system. How much people save should not be optional below a certain point.
2065 2018-02-03 20:40:32 We're really lucky to have a village shop that stocks fruit and veg from local farms so I can go down with my old lady straw bag & completely avoid packaging - some supermarkets will allow you to do this on loose veg but it's rare :-(

2095 2018-02-03 20:37:24 Those 1 time bonuses are part of your crap plan. It works best to make those distributions in 2017 and going forward it is all stocks and ownership. Must be nice to know most of your constituents don’t know how you screwed them over.

2107 2018-02-03 20:28:43 I am so glad you posted this, Chris! People with barely two dimes to rub together kept telling me how great the stock market is doing. I asked,”how r YOUR stocks doing?
2108 2018-02-03 20:28:40 $BA accounted for the whole move higher in the Dow Wednesday, with the remaining stocks weaker. At the same time NASI completed a small hook down from overbought levels, culminating in a sell off the rest of the week.
2109 2018-02-03 20:27:47 It’s how they make money inflating markets and then sell when their high causing them to drop...the nature of the stock market...stocks are based on projections and future earnings it’s easily manipulated
2110 2018-02-03 20:26:31 Bonds may be a dumber investment here than weed stocks.  Only half joking.
2111 2018-02-03 20:26:07 A small group of us were asking ourselves where money was going on Friday where the money was going.  Gold, stocks, bonds all down.  My theory for now is that it was rotating into Cryptos.  Big volume coming into $LTC $ETH since Thursday-Friday
2112 2018-02-03 20:25:41 I predicted a 10% rise in public stocks for 2018, which is great, in a great economy. Markets growing as fast as 2017 is unrealistic, like btc was unrealistic.

2120 2018-02-03 20:20:39 @NovilloArturo2 where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
2121 2018-02-03 20:20:34 patience to hold a position and patience to enter a position. Both imp. ppl looking at stocks that have cracked recently should remind themselves of this.
2122 2018-02-03 20:20:19 Yes, and wages remain stagnant and stocks dropped drastically. Thanks greedy gop.
2123 2018-02-03 20:17:44 Nothing wrong with that. I’ll be diversifying into stocks, but waiting for a large correction. I don’t trust the current bull run. Maybe some gas left in the tank but not a good entry at this point for me. But if you’re doing well congrats. Remember to take profit

2126 2018-02-03 20:16:28 Stocks will compound for a nominal total return of 8-9% from here. 2% from buybacks, 2% from dividends 2% from inflation and rest from GDP growth. Only guarantee is that it won’t be in a straight line.
2127 2018-02-03 20:15:40 .@NTBookshop stocks that brand!
2128 2018-02-03 20:15:25  One more flush to 118/117 TLT then a sharp snap back higher, supporting a bottom in stocks, renewed downside in the dollar, and higher metals imo.
2129 2018-02-03 20:14:00 First you have to run good. I read @NateSilver538 on poker. Similar stats & behavioral discipline required as with stocks
2130 2018-02-03 20:12:42 You have to specialise. The two are very similar but I stick to my strengths which is stocks
2131 2018-02-03 20:12:04 .
My exact thought when I heard that stocks tumbled bc of wage increases.

What kind of screwed up system is that, and why do we tolerate it??

2133 2018-02-03 20:11:32 As I shared in my report on #Gold last week and can be applied to Oil and Stocks too. There's clearly a battle going on between Fundamentals, Fed policy, on one side and technicals, positioning, sentiment on the other. All comes down to the $. Friday's action confirmed that imo.

2208 2018-02-03 20:06:46 Don't you think rather than focusing on macros we should focus on individual companies.. Lot of stocks went up 5x .. 10x even when liquidity was suck out of the system..
2209 2018-02-03 20:05:59 He's an idiot. Nothing to do with paychecks. It has to do with interest rates going up, making bonds a better investment than some stocks.
2210 2018-02-03 20:05:57 You mean you give credit to Obama when stocks go up.
2211 2018-02-03 20:05:30 Keep cheating me it will drop to 4% BAIL out and that's not just in cash I'm saving all your ads with euro too witch took way harder hit then bonds and stocks then cash
2212 2018-02-03 20:04:40 Would love to blame Trump on that, but yeah, it's a reaction to raising interest rates. Bonds will be more profitable than some stocks, so there was a selloff.

2215 2018-02-03 20:01:10 I suspect the big reason behind major credit card issuing #banks to stop accepting charges on #cryptocurrencies is due to a high delinquecy rate. People who bought at 15-19,000 may be defaulting. More regulation on the way. Staying away from big banks might be prudent. #stocks
2216 2018-02-03 20:00:16 But isn't that totally sound risk management, though? Would you advise anyone to buy stocks on credit cards? Remember, APR is 15-20%. It would be foolish, right? And compared to cryptos, stock prices are paragons of stability.
2217 2018-02-03 20:00:06 I was gonna stop at 66.6 tweets then stocks close 666 points down on same day so coincidence i think not so i will haunt on to 666k. Sorry im still here to paratweet u

2222 2018-02-03 19:58:07 Incredibly, minimum wage earners, many working more than one job; have no CLUE about 'hedge-funds' & investors who use these people as pawns in their little gambling games, as they play "chickie" with rising stocks.

2226 2018-02-03 19:54:17 Bump stocks are just the low-hanging fruit.  If they succeed in expanding their regulatory power here, The democrats will move to regulate everything from scopes and magazines to shotgun chokes.
2227 2018-02-03 19:54:14 OMG! Really? Check your stocks lately?
2228 2018-02-03 19:53:10 My best stocks during last week broad markets sell off were $DVAX and $NWBO, both hated by @adamfeuerstein. Must be a sign.
2229 2018-02-03 19:51:14 what about the stock market loss BIGGEST EVER IN HISTORY using your alternate facts...Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky
2230 2018-02-03 19:50:30 He'll just blather on ab how it's "time to buy" & "look at all the deals on cheap stocks I negotiated for you".  His minions will buy it. It'll take 50 yrs b4 any historians will be able to say this drop wasn't solely connected to bond yield prices & was more ab pol uncertainty
2231 2018-02-03 19:50:05 Studying so-called cryptos.. leads into looking at monies & stocks.. & then the question arises... How does one assess or assign value? In financial markets...housing markets...& also in one's own personal life..

2234 2018-02-03 19:47:20 I think I posted about 5 stocks of 4. I’ll take a break and post more stocks. This time perhaps African stocks that are grazing the stock markets and yielding profits.
2235 2018-02-03 19:47:07 Which stocks to go for bro. 
2236 2018-02-03 19:46:44 I think that's the main reason these Big Divvy Stocks are falling  (along with some Negative Momentum Psychology aspects) - the Equity Risk Premium has risen.
2237 2018-02-03 19:46:20 I believe i am as diverse as i could be with my current holdings

Pretty happy with the plays as i am in at the lows
2238 2018-02-03 19:46:14 My crude estimate of the “fair” value of the S&P 500 is 2050. So yeah, if US stocks drop another 23% or so in the near future, I might buy some more. $$ $SPX $DJIA $VIX

2240 2018-02-03 19:43:50 Come back?  Lol.  Record stocks, lowest unemployment for minorities ever, jobs coming back and taxes being cut at the same time.  If we can’t “Come back” from this, I’m ok with that.
2241 2018-02-03 19:43:43 #Stocks Take Biggest Tumble in Two Years-Typical FED, always on the wrong side of every issue! Higher rates give a return to obi’s 8 years of failed economic policy!@BreitbartNews
2242 2018-02-03 19:43:01 Someone came into the market this week and bought 50,000 March call option contracts on the VIX. MEANING-A big hitter is making a large bet that the volatility we saw in stocks Friday is only the beginning for the next 2 months. #Stocks #Invest
2243 2018-02-03 19:42:36 That is just a headline.  Something made up to explain the unexplainable. The real reason is that stocks are expensive and there are no buyers left.  It was way past time for a good old market crash and perhaps this is just the start.  We shall see.
2244 2018-02-03 19:42:07 Stocks fell over 600 points in one day, he's not talking about that though.
2245 2018-02-03 19:41:57 Interest rates on savings accounts shameful. Prejudice clearly tilted toward more risky stocks. 
2246 2018-02-03 19:41:44 Do you think the accounting methods for licensed producers played a part in the crash?
2247 2018-02-03 19:40:50 It's is why I kept warning people about the weed sector. But the weed sector took the venture and cse to bloated highs . So in the most part everything crashed with it . But some were not justified in other sectors and they will bounce back hard. Weed stocks not so much
2248 2018-02-03 19:38:27 My blog is not going to focus on #dividend stocks so I'm excited to learn from other #personalfinance bloggers who do talk about that!
2249 2018-02-03 19:37:45 Enterprising fellow. I'm guessing he only prescribes ingredients he stocks!
2250 2018-02-03 19:37:02 This crash is a huge chance to buy stocks at good rates
2251 2018-02-03 19:37:02 Bitcoin is the new Apple stocks. Or, internet business in the 90s.  Everyone think it's just a hype (specially those who doesn't even own 1) and rightfully so. But, all new markets/products go through the same to find its real value.
2252 2018-02-03 19:36:51 Closely followed strategist Jim Paulsen sees the possibly of a 15 percent correction in the stock market.
Market sentiment is too bullish, and stocks are "significantly overvalued," the chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group says.
2253 2018-02-03 19:36:40 That's not correct, bump stocks only help you bump fire, which is slower than almost all automatic firing, and far less accurate.

The people are the last check of power against the government, the second amendment was never about hunting.
2254 2018-02-03 19:36:32 Enjoy your traditional stocks man. See you :)
2255 2018-02-03 19:36:20 What an interesting note! Cause it’s full of controversies. So, it’s totally defines our Present days’ realities.
Cause if to come back to these bubbles in stocks & bonds, is that metaphorically speaking, or he really sees bubbles there? &Yes, both ways are possible, U know!
2256 2018-02-03 19:35:50 A Forestry Consultant told me yesterday that rural people are selling their timber like crazy,  into depressed mkt, to buy stocks, Bitcoin.
2257 2018-02-03 19:34:58 Dear God!  It wasn’t even a typo.  It may cover her Costco but won’t cover her healthcare or pay for the tax cuts the billionaires get while enjoying stocks and profits at an all time high!  FFS!!
2258 2018-02-03 19:34:44 It doesnt help that the way they calculate revenue based on plants actually cultivated compared to actually sold is ridiculous. Even major LPs ceo has mentioned the accounting methods are overstating the actual revenue. But $n namaste’s revenue is based on actually shipped items
2259 2018-02-03 19:34:35 Just Orderly Profit Taking. Interest Rates—Are Still- Way Too Low, to Cause Sustained Selling!  Stocks Will Still Bounce—from areas of Large Unfilled Limit Buy orders. The Key—Is Knowing what this looks like on Price Charts!

2262 2018-02-03 19:33:31 When investments turn to long term bonds, money gets pulled from riskier investments such as stocks, and ultimately we go into a bear market. At that point you’re going to see massive layoffs as companies can’t support their previous growth.
2263 2018-02-03 19:33:27 I agree John - I just can't see the point of bothering with such a smelly sector. So many other great Stocks out there. #CPI probably the best but long way from being rehabilitated and able to be released back into Society  ;-)
2264 2018-02-03 19:33:03 1) THAT DOESNT MEAN BUMP STOCKS SHOULD BE LEGAL
2) No it's not, its state law.
3) Forget about whether or not it is technically a machine gun, Assault weapons, in general, should be illegal. Why would any person need one except to kill people?
2265 2018-02-03 19:32:47 Well top cryptos are bouncing off not bad

Hope she fares better than I did in 2008. My retirement account tanked and my house wasn't worth a plug nickel.
2267 2018-02-03 19:31:43 1) Banning bump stocks is just stupid, you can easily bump fire without one
2) We have background checks for online and gun show purchases, I've done both, it's federal, not state law
3) Machine guns are already largely banned, and no one has used one in a crime in a long time

2273 2018-02-03 19:29:05 I wonder when he's going to claim credit for this week's drop in stocks?
2274 2018-02-03 19:28:57 You know that the jump in the Dow is due to the fact that he and his cronies dumped billions into the market to show a strong market, so people would invest, stocks would go up, they could cash out and make a shit ton of money and leave you poor sucks losing your shirts
2275 2018-02-03 19:28:56 why are you not talking about the BIGGEST LOSS EVER (using trumps alternate facts..lol )in the stock market..666 it fell..Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky.
2276 2018-02-03 19:28:07 I will agree that the Tax cuts were good for the stock market. Give more cash to corporation and business of course stocks will rise.  Hell just send everyone a $1,000 in government cash and same effect.  Credit is great and deficits don’t matter. Until they do.
2277 2018-02-03 19:26:35 an il-timed tax cut that inadvertently pushed wage growth into overdrive & stocks lower would be pretty ironic on a  partisan basis
2278 2018-02-03 19:25:18 Stock market? Any stocks interest you?
2279 2018-02-03 19:24:29 Mais en vrai Rilès il rend fou à faire des stocks limités, résultats on est pleins à rester frustrés parce qu'on a pas réagi assez tôt 
2280 2018-02-03 19:24:26 Shorts are using this to panic the new traders or the nervous ones to sell. Without question alot of these stocks the correction was justified others imho not so much. So time well tell. The worst is almost over

2290 2018-02-03 19:19:00 Banning bump-stocks is just the latest in a string of infringements to the second amendment. To what end? Saving lives? That’s never been your agenda, it’s just using emotion to form a fallacious argument to justify more nonsense regulation.

2293 2018-02-03 19:17:29 Obama is the only president in history to never be above 3% GDP average for a year which the real gage used to tell how strong an economy is. No one cares how many agricultural jobs at$8 an hour there were, the jobs in the last year, bonuses and stocks given out blow Obama out
2294 2018-02-03 19:16:10 Not even close to being fucking true. Employees are seeing higher healthcare costs due to Trumpcare, corporations are buying back stocks rather than increase wages and many workers are being laid off

Fun Fact: AP was Hitler's favorite propaganda arm. Look it up.
2295 2018-02-03 19:15:09 Beside this, also consider that when people can borrow easily from banks to invest in #RealEstate & the return was so good (caused by this rush) they are not motivated in investing in stocks or businesses. It is unhealthy for economy that too much money pumped to #housing sector.
2296 2018-02-03 19:14:39 No. This is a real business with a real future. I will realize my gains when it suits me. I could not “break” into the legal cannabis game on what I have invested in stocks. This IS the little guys way in.

2301 2018-02-03 19:08:11 @grassosteve I liked your straight forward comments on the stocks Square,Twitter,& Rite Aid. You come across as an honest guy & mention you have bought the stock.

2306 2018-02-03 19:03:31 Market volatility is a good thing. That means when a slight correction happens one can buy stocks on sale.
2307 2018-02-03 19:03:09 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels!

2325 2018-02-03 18:50:30 I hope so. We told the incharge of the store to reserve us if new stocks will come. And she basically brushed us off by saying there are so many looking for it. There goes my hope

2337 2018-02-03 18:41:17 Stock market doesn't help his regular people. 50% do not have stocks. Rich people love stock.
2338 2018-02-03 18:40:38 I'm not sure a big crash is at hand yet. But I am reasonably sure that the days of up, up, and away are over and that stocks will languish as interest rates and inflation start to rise and bonds start to become more attractive than equity to investors.
2339 2018-02-03 18:40:13 Actually when the stock prices are high that is the time to sell your stocks. A bunch of people sold their stock which means there are more stocks available. When Supply increases the price decreases

2343 2018-02-03 18:38:19 When interest rates climb, investors start putting money into things like CD’s & bonds, They are less risky than stocks. You could just as easily, brag about interest rates finally going up. Interest rates going up is a sign of a strong economy! That didn’t happen under obama
2344 2018-02-03 18:37:47 No... WRONG... YOU do not know what you’re talking about because losers like you do not own stocks. You own six packs of beer and jugs of moonshine.

2348 2018-02-03 18:36:09 This started to happen in mid ‘07, long before stocks peaked in October ‘07.
2349 2018-02-03 18:35:25 Sorry, Are you saying that the crypto market first will see the next ATH next year due to higher interest rates? Also saying that Bonds, stocks and cryptos have a correlation via interest rates.
2350 2018-02-03 18:35:12 Riding a roller-coaster is fun. But when it comes to stocks, I hate getting on at a price and getting off at the same price. Rules help us. #stocks #investing

2352 2018-02-03 18:34:29 Stocks markets and actual people's lives are totally disconnected. And it's getting worse.

2354 2018-02-03 18:34:02 I'm looking but most compete at $10 a cable to start.  Amazon stocks subset of monoprice stock thought the mark up is more than import. Will continue to hunt for that bargain. :)
2355 2018-02-03 18:31:58 Yeah that's very true. It's frustrated me because I've gone off the FTSE100 for Shorting and tend to use S&P500 but of course the former has tanked. It's possibly the heavy Weighting to big Divvy Stocks which are hated at moment. Decoupled from £ though.

2357 2018-02-03 18:31:46 You are talking about a one day performance . $EGL is down around 40% in the last year,  $E up 50% in the last year. $FAT is up over 700% in one year and a majority of the weed stocks are still up 100% - 1000%’s even after this correction. Look at the big picture 
2358 2018-02-03 18:31:19 I don't see how this is an issue. Can you buy stocks with a credit card ?

2361 2018-02-03 18:28:57 Sooo since Trump took credit for the stock market doing well, I can only imagine he’ll be taking credit for stocks dropping right?
2362 2018-02-03 18:28:32 The double whammy is when your HELOC capacity gets re-assessed lower and you need to come up with $ to cover your losses in scammy syndicated mortgage schemes, or bitcoin or pot stocks...
2363 2018-02-03 18:28:07 Yes...it’s trouble. Some nice reddish sedums are good water wise substitutes that can look kind of similar. Edwards always stocks them in the spring. 
2364 2018-02-03 18:27:54 But its all a fallacy, the economy is being artificially inflated through buybacks of stocks and monopolization. Wouldn't you want to be against this?
2365 2018-02-03 18:27:43 @realDonaldTrump U TOOK CREDIT FOR STOCKS GOING UP NOW U MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM CRASHING! UR SILENCE IS LOUD AND CLEAR

2372 2018-02-03 18:24:21 OMG. Stocks pulled back because inflation may finally be coming back to the economy. Also, Apple & Google earnings weren't as positive as everyone has been used to.
NOTHING was proven in the memo yesterday. Certainly no link between Russia & Dems.
2373 2018-02-03 18:24:15 God you people are idiots.  Stocks rise and fall all the time.  Interest rates may go up, which freaks people out.  Stocks can't stay high forever.  Everything rises and falls, except for the intelligence of liberals, that's always falling.

2377 2018-02-03 18:22:26 Because companies are buying their owns stocks!
2378 2018-02-03 18:22:14 I've found that investing in the companies that make the video cards and instruments for crypto to be more profitable flipping penny stocks. Or, you buy when Bitcoin drops another 10% and eventually it will go up. They're trying to get rid of all paper forms of $ eventually.
2379 2018-02-03 18:21:30 you're actually taking this seriously of the stocks that Ghost was talking about......that's rare from a friend who is a brony. I hope you get a good deal:3

2381 2018-02-03 18:20:51 Ahh well my retirement went up 2%, but then after my health insurance went up 12% ( ended up losing money.,  Guess that the good ole GOP #TaxScamBill . makes me wonder how much of it went to the 1% who have the money to put into stocks
2382 2018-02-03 18:20:32 Stocks suffered their worst loss in two years on Friday. The economy appears to be slowing with wages and interest rates on the rise. Can our nation now afford to add another 1.5 trillion to the national debt to finance a transfer of wealth to our richest citizens?
2383 2018-02-03 18:19:54 Economic growrh for whom? 85% of stocks owned by the 1%. Good luck getting them to spend their boon. Our military is larger than most of the world's combined, it should be cut in half.

2403 2018-02-03 18:05:57 What are your thoughts on the gun violence/murder in Chicago with the strictest gun laws in the nation? Perhaps you should focus on something productive such as federal corruption, fraud, and abuse of power, not just worthless "busy work" like bump stocks which won't pass anyway.
2404 2018-02-03 18:05:53 Remember that really severe phase of my depression where I literally just shut myself in and did nothing but cultivate my stocks in guild wars
2405 2018-02-03 18:05:22 Anyone that has been alive more than 18 years knows stock goes up and down. I lost a bunch in 08, got sick and lost my career before replacing much of it. I would never invest in stocks again. I would have been better off just saving at low interest. Don't put your future in SM.
2406 2018-02-03 18:04:51 Stocks are so severely over priced that I expect a much larger correction.

2408 2018-02-03 18:03:42 #Retail stocks have been and still are being beat to shit by the market. This is over fears of #Amazon and other #ecommerce companies dominating the industry.  However, such fears are overblown. In recent years we have seen more retail stores opening than closing.

2410 2018-02-03 18:02:02 I know that the Dow has nothing to do with the actual state of the Economy. It only pertains to stocks, which is how people are feeling about the economy.
2411 2018-02-03 18:01:59 I am upset. I fully understand this golden rule. I follow it for my stocks capital. However, I don't follow it regarding cryptos coz 1/ I am ready to loose everything with a 2% personal capital 2/ Long term bullish market so => Ready to Broke or Fortune = High risk. Do you agree?

2422 2018-02-03 17:53:52 Did people sell their cryptocurrencies to cover margin calls in stocks, or did they sell stocks to cover credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies? Neither? Both? 
2423 2018-02-03 17:53:23 Stocks went down on Friday because wages were up.  Capital does not like it when wages for labor are up.  Good for Labor, Bad for Capital.  The stock market is a measure of "how are things going for Capital?" #inequality

2428 2018-02-03 17:50:58 I do trade stocks and yes 99% buy on hype which is why they lose their ass...cause when there is hype your buying a pump and just about to witness a dump more often than not. Remember when the WHOLE tl we're financial advisors and pumped Tron and Ripple? How that work out?

2436 2018-02-03 17:44:45 Just another Liberal leave out the #FactsMatter. When Interest rates go up the bond market becomes safer and profitable. Therefore money is taken out of stocks to invest in bonds. Economy 101. Don't expect Liberals to understand  basics though.

2450 2018-02-03 17:39:18 Remember stock market index has nothing to do with the economy. It is highly susceptible to manipulation especially in this era of crony capitalism. All the stocks which I watch are down more than ever.
2451 2018-02-03 17:39:10 In late 2016 you tweeted that you sold all your stocks and went to cash. Now you change your story and say you invested overseas? You seem to be full of shit.
2452 2018-02-03 17:38:27 She lost her social security and medicare for a lousy $1.50 a week?  Because Ryan is already aiming for those to cover the massive deficit the Republicans just created and stocks down, dollar down, growth rate down.  GOP lies that growth will cover it up.
2453 2018-02-03 17:37:24 I'm thinking 3 since no broker owned by a bank let's their clients purchase pot related stocks.  100% true, I told my parents to buy ACBFF and their broker owned by wells Fargo said they can't buy any pot stocks for their clients because of FED... so he had to open his own acct.

2455 2018-02-03 17:36:43 OUR DOOMSDAY TACTIC (save for later):  

If we & our 401Ks stopped buying stocks (ie boycott stock purchases), stock market would crash causing severe recession.  There would be a huge uprising to get rid of Trump and GOP.

@TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats
2456 2018-02-03 17:36:37 The markets went down over 650 pts in part because people’s avg wages went up. Plus market gains only help if you are invested in stocks, which, depending on which reports you read, means half the country doesnt get helped. Tricky to tie your fortunes to a prickly yardstick.
2457 2018-02-03 17:35:53 I'm up 29 percent for the year! Democrats don't have stocks so they have no frame of reference.
2458 2018-02-03 17:35:45 I doubt that Treasury’s at 3% will affect investments in massive growth stocks like $NVDA, $AMD etc.. Am I wrong? Maybe $XOM, $MMM
2459 2018-02-03 17:35:29 The rich do not pay the corporate tax. Companies pass along the tax to us, in the cost of their products.

The big-shots pay Capital Gains tax on stocks/dividends.

Btw, aside from the repatriation rate, we are now taxing profits held overseas, whether or not they bring it home.

2466 2018-02-03 17:33:07 I may be wrong but if trading index than intraday only,if carrying fwd only stocks ...I am happy with this from 10 years
2467 2018-02-03 17:30:45 The fault lies with those that use stock prices to create a narrative about how the economy is doing.

Stocks go up and down for all sorts of bullshit reasons with little connection to broader economic health.

2474 2018-02-03 17:28:22 Lol! My mom chews chicken bones just like you. I personally don't get it BUT we use bones in the culinary industry to make stocks, the collagen in them becomes gelatinous making for awesome sauces. They're full of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium.
2475 2018-02-03 17:28:08 If lenders are competing to lend and bidding down spreads, and risk free rate is HIGHER, and yield curve is STEEPER, and USD WEAKER , and earnings are revised HIGHER and wage growth is HIGHER

Then why in God’s name do people think stocks should go lower? Screw your technicals
2476 2018-02-03 17:26:56 One observation from Friday:
 - stocks 
 - bonds 
 - gold 
 - cryptos 
 - commodities 
 - cash ---- flat 
(cash is a position)
2477 2018-02-03 17:26:55 Hey man, try check out these stocks ACGLP, ACGLO, and ARCT. I've been watching your videos and was wondering if these are going to be good DIP BUYS...
2478 2018-02-03 17:26:43 Ppl don’t realize the stock market is not the economy. The market is always in greater flux then the econ is & though the market affects the econ it’s not to the great degree elected officials would have us think. So if u don’t own stocks the market has very little affect on ur $
2479 2018-02-03 17:25:29 just make my portfolio public, updated daily. picking up stocks before moves. i have also group in fb
2480 2018-02-03 17:25:25 Actually its the DEMS selling off all their stocks so they can flee our country to find a "SAFE SPACE"  LOL  It was a sell off and will pick up again soon...no worries..Stock has to go down sometimes, and slowly rise again..
2481 2018-02-03 17:25:17 Do you even buy or own stocks? Clearly, you have no idea how market works. You guys are only good at jumping at any opportunity to discredit Trump administration. Just complete idiocy!
2482 2018-02-03 17:24:43 So when the stocks have record setting days. Trump can take credit for that. Including using it to point how great the economy is. But bad days. Not the Presidents fault and nothing at all to do with the economy. Gotcha
2483 2018-02-03 17:24:31 I do like the stocks-taking-a-downturn one and I really think kids would understand the negatives there.
2484 2018-02-03 17:24:21 And, of course, “you’re a sucker if you are not investing in stocks” was a popular idea in 1929, 1999, and now.
2485 2018-02-03 17:23:55 You know that feeling when you are walking with friend and your prof catches him to give full dose and you too get a bit of it just because you happened to be there at that time....
Well, a whole bunch of stocks are going through that feeling in this post-budget harakiri!

2492 2018-02-03 17:20:28 Starting in 2019 the wealthiest Americans will get that huge Tax cut so unless you're a millionaire or billionaire, you're not getting squat! Stocks fell 666 points yesterday making it the 6th lowest in U.S
 History!
2493 2018-02-03 17:20:26 He was in for theft. Don't remember what I was in for, probably the same. It was a small town and we were young, so they'd decided not to hang us. But we were looking at time in the stocks at least. Neither of us was keen on that, so we skipped town. They didn't follow us far. >
2494 2018-02-03 17:20:09 Update: NEWSFLASH!!!
Stocks TANKED 666 points as soon as they released the fu(c)king bogus @zz memo! 666... Let. That. Sink. In!!!
2495 2018-02-03 17:20:01 I haven't been in the game long, but I'm in for a long haul.  I'm confident in my stocks, and have done my DD, so hopefully things will start to climb!
2496 2018-02-03 17:19:57 Stocks tend to have a “chosen” MA they ride on a specific timeframe and if you can get a wash, not slow grind, to that MA it’s usually a pretty good spot to look at entry with set risk.
2497 2018-02-03 17:19:41 Go take a hike. 
Nikhil ji reads filmfare before buying stocks.
2498 2018-02-03 17:19:15 That's what people do. I spent 13 years as a stockbroker & every damn time the market would dip people would freak out. They'd panic, sell stocks, lose money & then start all over again.
2499 2018-02-03 17:19:04 666.Looks like even the devil sold his stocks.
2500 2018-02-03 17:18:57 Yeah, it’s called the federal reserve raising interest rates because the economy looks so promising.  Something they NEVER did in the 8 years of obama.  When Feds increase interest rates, stocks drop.  This was the largest number drop because the markets have seen such huge gains
2501 2018-02-03 17:18:52 Trapped in Btc or the stocks market?
2502 2018-02-03 17:18:50 Yes! For me and other young friends , we literally don’t have any other investment choice as we see stocks (corporations) as evil ecocidal planet destroyers, and cash /bonds as instruments of government and banks which we don’t trust ...
2503 2018-02-03 17:18:12 Stocks were on sale. You only lose if you sell. The stock market is a long term game, but yes, this underscores the need for multiple streams of income in retirement. It helps to be creative.
2504 2018-02-03 17:16:43 Lets start looking at all Dems for ties to Russia @RepAdamSchiff has stocks in Russia and I'm Pretty sure we will find out all kinds of things about them Hillary and Bill went back and forth to Russsia
2505 2018-02-03 17:16:10 Owning a share of stock is an act of trust. If the trust is our economy is taken away, stocks are worthless.
2506 2018-02-03 17:15:51 Many #cannabis stocks are off 50% in the last week; a move that smacks of indiscriminate selling and suggests 1) forced liquidation 2) bad news is coming or 3) retail / emotional holders over-react.  If U have a longer-term lens tho, 50% off is purty nice. #cannabinoid #wellness
2507 2018-02-03 17:15:32 Sooooo..... those stocks that were “so high” sure are super low..... ijs #stock
2508 2018-02-03 17:15:22 Mor stocks will be bought and sold. Usually internal expansions take some  and wha la. Investments start showing up in other companies?
2509 2018-02-03 17:15:19 Best time next week to buy good stocks at dirt cheap prices ! Shop till the market stops to drop !
2510 2018-02-03 17:15:07 “666” Day B4: “Overbought #stocks will soon be crashed by Oligarchs’ selling, profiting themselves & ruining 401K savers.  #Millennials et al: Sell B4 The Oligarchs & their facilitating Plutoctats Screw you over. @AP_Politics @SenSanders @OurRevolution @MSNBC @CNN I was dead-on!
2511 2018-02-03 17:14:47 Is the middle class actively engaged in the buy and sale of property? Property dealings need funds on a larger scale as compared to stocks
2512 2018-02-03 17:14:29 Lots of layoffs too and how about those stocks friday. Wow!
2513 2018-02-03 17:14:20 Another reason why stocks took it on the chin yesterday and to be fair we did warn that if the market did break down it could likely have a very substantial drop thus we took the initiative to sell & short all indices including the soaring Nasdaq late Thurs afternoon ahead of the

2515 2018-02-03 17:13:53 If you are convinced of few stocks for LTCG pl share,
2516 2018-02-03 17:13:51 It will rise from the ashes again. It always does. By the way Europe and American stocks are also falling.
2517 2018-02-03 17:12:32 Some of the bonuses were given 2017 for tax benefits. The new regs make bonuses like that less desirable. Expect companies to hold for internal stocks - in other words going forward stocks and ownership will be how companies sit on money. These "bonuses" won't likely be repeated
2518 2018-02-03 17:12:18 2018= lower taxes ever, "see your paycheck if u work" Stocks all time high, Black unemployment all time low, #ISIS 90% defeated, unemployment all time low, wages have gone up faster than ever, #democRats kicking and screaming, Apple bringing 350 bill 2 our country, 
And much more
2519 2018-02-03 17:11:36 No bailouts, hated bailouts they were wrong, stock market crash didn’t affect me, I had no stocks and my hope is not in stock market. Inflation is the way the govt steals from America. I want hope & unity & not doom and gloom and division. & truth not lies
2520 2018-02-03 17:11:34 This selling of stocks is just by the people who are creating volatility in the market. We will see the magic of the markets in the coming weeks
2521 2018-02-03 17:11:17 The order of strength on the indices is quite simple as on close Friday: $NQ_F $ES_F $RTY_F ... Dow is and has never been a gauge for me although I look at some of the components / stocks to trade.
2522 2018-02-03 17:11:07 Break the cartel controlling the price... those small moves in respect of what happens in stocks...bonds... don t reflect thé right price of gold and silver. I am tired of those manipulations. Even now they have their hands on crypto.
2523 2018-02-03 17:10:41 Hedge funds.  Yeah, I hate those too.  And shorting stocks.  Yeah, I hate that too.  And in this country we honor those people with ridiculously low taxes, and bail them out when their Capitalistic Carnage wipes out the world....
2524 2018-02-03 17:10:37 Still up from 30 days ago. Now is a pretty good time to buy. Stocks are on sale.
2525 2018-02-03 17:09:34 Stocks?
2526 2018-02-03 17:07:49 en gros, de base gcheat il prend masse de logs tu vois et genre ça les stocks puis quand ils font des updates ça doit scan les anciennes logs ect enfin je pense j'suis pas dev donc c'est que des théorie
2527 2018-02-03 17:07:45 This is old news....this is why all the DNA stocks tanked years ago...
2528 2018-02-03 17:07:28 It’ll be up next week. Who cares. I’m glad stocks go on sale now and then.
2529 2018-02-03 17:07:07 85% of the world population lives near the ocean.  The oceans control the weather, warmer weather means more storms.  Which is very bad. Don’t even get started on good stocks and melting glaciers.
2530 2018-02-03 17:06:57 Its just people raking in some profits like myself. Cashed in some stocks made a couple of grand..
2531 2018-02-03 17:06:17 @FoxNewsOpinion Stock markets are like moving tectonic plates.  You can have no earthquakes from slippage and we think that is great (stocks keep going up) and then have a major earthquake.  Or you can have small corrections along the way with little distruction.

2533 2018-02-03 17:05:34 if stocks were about to really crash, we would see the deterioration taking place in the credit markets, like in early 2015 for example. We're not seeing that at all today. It's the exact opposite actually. $HYG $JNK $TLT $IEF $LQD

2535 2018-02-03 17:04:33 As we commented yesterday, when interest rates rise too sharply it tends to spook stocks. Also while last years 2.9% increase in wages was the highest in eight years and with such a long time coming, worth celebrating, it also means companies will make less money and so this was
2536 2018-02-03 17:03:40 on my "safe" stocks I went in too big chased them down and held on.  just had my biggest drawdown ever. 7% of account.  recovering looks pretty bad going into a down market now.
2537 2018-02-03 17:03:39 Los niños que estan en Sename no son stocks que se pueden mover de una bodega a otra!!! Son vidas y hay que trabajar individualmente en cada uno de elllos.. con procesos  que requieren intervencion de profesionales!!! Cuando van a entender!!! 30 de marzo? Colegios?
2538 2018-02-03 17:02:15 Just wait for Monday when people check their retirement stocks and see how low your @realDonaldTrump polling will historically drop!
2539 2018-02-03 17:01:29 if stocks were about to really crash, we would see the deterioration taking place in the credit markets, like in early 2015 for example. We're not seeing that at all today. It's the exact opposite actually. $HYG $JNK $TLT $IEF $LQD

2541 2018-02-03 17:00:40 Satan curses the market, 666 means Christians are hard up stocks buying the dip for the highs that never hit.  Giving me time to sell the snot out of double top like a roller coaster from hell
2542 2018-02-03 17:00:21 @VinkaJackson  estoy de acuerdo con el termino de ese cread.. pero desde el sentido comun, es imposible de acá al 30 de marzo, hacer un correcto proceso para cada una de las vidas de esos niños!!! No son cosas, ni animales.. ni stocks que se mueven de una bodega a otra!!
2543 2018-02-03 16:59:30 The economy was ruined under a OBAMA! My 401K tanked! Stocks tanked, jobs left USA, illegal border crossing! Please!
2544 2018-02-03 16:59:20 Yes I should have taken wayyyy more of my profits  - #1 regret - but I know better for next leg up (crypto + regular stocks because anything can happen and cash is still king)
2545 2018-02-03 16:59:06 Today i asked my portfolio stocks simple question......are you all fine.....any reason to worry as all of you are down due to #LTCG tax virus

Stock Replied : ya ya...perfectly fine....Just a viral... will take time to recover....but once we recover...we will have super party 
2546 2018-02-03 16:59:01 That's not to say it can't be traded and flipped as a short-term investment. However, it's underlying value, and thus long term price potential is ultimately tied to whether or not it becomes a mainstream currency. It's price is speculative, not grounded in profitability (stocks)

2548 2018-02-03 16:58:16 @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand Why arent @DNC out in force on every channel talking about how the #TrumpTaxCut is causing inflation and stocks to tank and budgets to bust. Where are you? Why am I stuck supporting people who are trying to lose 2018 elections?
2549 2018-02-03 16:58:10 Funny, the left didn't worry when the stocks were soaring! Can't have it both ways! Maybe Soros hacked our stock market!
2550 2018-02-03 16:57:11 Bond markets are sending a warning inpacting stocks. People have been rushing into the market resulting in bloated prices that may settle with a correction and  finally, the market dropped in anticipation of rising Fed rates. There is not 1 indicator that resulted in the drop.
2551 2018-02-03 16:55:17 It's funny how the right never sees the 228% increase in stocks under Obama showing the have no idea what they are talking about
2552 2018-02-03 16:54:47 Credit card interest rates are downright criminal. Get rid of that as soon as you can. Stocks are a potential gain while debt is a guaranteed loss.
2553 2018-02-03 16:53:18 @Love_and_Money @dusktilldawn @hunch go back to your stocks, earning a quite few pc. You don’t belong to this game, it’s for grown ups.
2554 2018-02-03 16:53:01 Has any1 asked a lib what the hell Obama did yesterday that made the stocks dip 600 pts? They keep saying this is due to O. They never answered me when I asked bout the 500 dip a few mths ago. Can they can answer it now. Or are they going to admit this is Trumps economy?
2555 2018-02-03 16:52:43 Good stocks are like tennis balls. They will bounce back. Rubbish stocks are like eggs. When they fall they splatter! In the next few weeks you figure whether you have tennis balls or eggs in your portfolio.
2556 2018-02-03 16:52:35 Post hoc ergo propter hoc. You probably own stocks in insulin manufacturers, too, don't you?
2557 2018-02-03 16:52:21 Also you may not see the utility of what Wall Street does, but people who have their retirement invested or the work for a company who depends on how stocks are traded may disagree with you
2558 2018-02-03 16:50:51 Its typical that everyone comes out today and says how much all stocks are still going to drop, after TWO bad days in the market, quoting CNBC and other 'expert' sources. Some sectors have already seen a washout (crypto, weed) and may offer some decent opportunities.
2559 2018-02-03 16:47:57 "feels a little bubbly" is the least convincing argument I have heard yet that the #StockMarket is in a bubble. In 2000 the bubble was caused by overvaluing internet companies, and in 2007/8 it was caused by fraud. It was never because the market felt a little bubbly #stocks
2560 2018-02-03 16:47:45 Part of portfolio should be in cash, hehe
2561 2018-02-03 16:47:40 Lol I just find it hilarious... rates shot up cuz of good economy numbers that came up expecting that fed will raise rates 4 times in 2018 not 3 as was expected.... higher interest rates = BAD thing for stocks
2562 2018-02-03 16:46:44 Or crowdunded? I suspect some folks who invest in pharms stocks are sometimes "betting" a trial leads to a blockbuster.
2563 2018-02-03 16:46:34 bwhahhaa.  what 'stalks' do you own, please cher...bwhahhaa.  doturd's uneds and paid russian bots. dumb as rocks and none whom voted and live in rural america, least educated, poorest people in country own stocks, stalks to all of you. they're (there to you) unemployed.
2564 2018-02-03 16:46:34 But when the stocks go up it’s because of obummer right? Yeah stfu
2565 2018-02-03 16:46:12 Hey Alex,
What are u showing me with the stocks?
2566 2018-02-03 16:44:27 There hard work, there also ingenuity though as well as the luck of draw line investing in stocks or having a good idea.
2567 2018-02-03 16:44:21 Another helpful tip is buy stocks when their p/e ratio is lower than their 5 year average p/e.
2568 2018-02-03 16:42:58 The dot com bubble is a great lesson for bitcoin devotees. Tech stocks traded at MASSIVE multiples.  Smug believers laughed at those calling for a crash. “It’s a different model.  A new paradigm.  You luddites don’t understand”. No, they did.
2569 2018-02-03 16:42:50 Yep if you include how he cheated in a Supreme Court judge; made tax cuts for his family and friends, and road the coattails of Obama’s on the economy and stock market.  Well now it’s him and three days of stocks plunging is all in him.  Funny how today you’re making $ at 
2570 2018-02-03 16:42:27 dont do shit but acquire currency smoke dope and check stocks
2571 2018-02-03 16:42:10 I can always rely on @elonmusk company stocks to keep me from going crazy
2572 2018-02-03 16:41:51 Just a question to followers .. has anyone been trading the launch list stocks with me since I started the $2500 challenge ?

2574 2018-02-03 16:41:23 Boring Company should go public so i can buy some stocks
2575 2018-02-03 16:40:39 I always think about 1929, was it the top? We ether mulpily or die. I believe that applies stocks as well.

2600 2018-02-03 16:37:10 Before you panic about #Stocks , companies sell stock every spring to start spring building projects.  Stocks are how corps store money.
2601 2018-02-03 16:36:59 Stocks gonna be way down again when the market opens.
2602 2018-02-03 16:36:56 You should be investing your money somewhere and stocks are safe
2603 2018-02-03 16:36:38 But seriously, a long tail is fine as long as 70-80% capital in 7-10 stocks.

2608 2018-02-03 16:34:50 Yes tried to poison the wrong tree one that doesnt even connect to trumps investigation. As seeing fisa warrwant after page was gone from your campaign so on another story how about your stocks this week? Stocks did great huh
2609 2018-02-03 16:34:04 Cannabis stocks all down today
2610 2018-02-03 16:33:36 Why can’t trials be invested in like stocks, instead of only government or pharma funded? Invest like startups? #clinicalTrials
2611 2018-02-03 16:32:26 .@roopamdreamer ... so if you dont find it attractive, dont invest in stocks. 
no reason to give special treatment to equity gains any more. 
@prabhuchawla fully support your view
2612 2018-02-03 16:32:03 To recap as yields go up Bond values go down (Two variables are inverse) ,Bond Selloff deepens and investors return to stocks
2613 2018-02-03 16:31:40 Do they have stocks of Best Buy, I'm about to invest.
2614 2018-02-03 16:31:35 The more I read about Harvey Weinstein, the more I wish we could put him in the stocks, & give all the women cricket bats.

Have a great Saturday! #ACMPR
2616 2018-02-03 16:31:28 On9 shopping with bro: 
Pushing a lot of carts together, going round & round in the stores. Not enough money to check out. Luckily they never close, only get out of stocks. 
2617 2018-02-03 16:31:27 Stocks are way down taking credit for it @realDonaldTrump
2618 2018-02-03 16:31:19 That's a shame. I need to start investing in their stocks.
2619 2018-02-03 16:30:48 If you calculate an earnings bump for some of these companies based on an existing buyback and benefit from tax changes, there's an awful lot of stocks that are 15-17 earnings vs 20-23X as it appears now
2620 2018-02-03 16:30:45 Sarko s’est retiré pitoyablement de Lybie en laissant tous les stocks d’armes à la disposition des factions. L’histoire l’a déjà jugé. Il n’y a que les sarkolâtres comme vous pour nier ce fait.
2621 2018-02-03 16:29:40 Stocks were pummeled on Friday, capping the worst week in two years. thank you Trump. your disgraceful memo drama cost the country(in more ways than one)
2622 2018-02-03 16:29:21 Wait! What about my stocks? The market tanks and now you tweet about fake polls? WTF! My retirement just took a big hit you big fraud and no tweet for me? And why is unemployment back to 7.5 % for black Americans? Thanks Trump!
2623 2018-02-03 16:28:24 How did you explain to your children that u traded stocks illegally as soon as you got to DC?
How did you explain to your  children that their grandma's business was raided by FBI?

2626 2018-02-03 16:27:08 Yes! Business & investor money talks. #stocks rise showing the sentiment,  hopes & our expectations for winning results based on our Leader's direction and strength.

 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump IS  Leader. #MAGA
2627 2018-02-03 16:26:44 I said, Fight? Oh yeah, Shit we are just taking money off the table right here long traders can play long term and be right, markets are going Down in a drug induced decline of health care stocks.
2628 2018-02-03 16:26:42 Stocks Swoon, Sending Dow Down Over 600 Points / And so it begins; with Trump in power, we will see a recession that will make the 2008 crash seem like a gentle bump.
2629 2018-02-03 16:26:25 I have been following you always select safe stocks like ONGC Coal, Wipro, etc. Good stocks for FO with low ATR. PCJ, Jindal are crazy with high ATR.
2630 2018-02-03 16:26:11 @realDonaldTrump - How is your fabulous stock market doing? #TheResistance #stocks #trump
2631 2018-02-03 16:25:58 Betting against Tom Brady is like shorting stocks.
2632 2018-02-03 16:25:22 Interest rates and stocks will rise in stutter-step this year. Bitcoin? Not so much.
2633 2018-02-03 16:24:56 If true, this can explain why the @robertmuellerr took HEU 2 Russia W/ the help of @ClintonFdn , @JamesComeyFBI & @AGLynch 

But most all of, this can also explains why Mueller has share, stocks and / or bonds W/ #Uranium1

Sadly, Uranium Energy Corp could B the next Uranium 1
2634 2018-02-03 16:23:59 If you are holding stocks you like, it is an opportunity to add more on a pulback.
2635 2018-02-03 16:23:45 Dear sir budget is mainly focused on which sector ? Which stocks could benefit? And market is responding negative which stocks I can buy
2636 2018-02-03 16:23:03 stocks tank, on release of @DevinNunes nothingburger.  9/11 was a big ugly lie and the stock market knows it.

2637 2018-02-03 16:22:57 This is stupid.   Stocks dont vary on Trumps mood.   Now if ur asking me to vote on if Buffett got a hotcakes meal or the usual then that would be another discussion
2638 2018-02-03 16:21:50 @barrychoi I'm curious about your thoughts on a company like Wealthsimple. Do you think it is a good option for people without a lot of time to put into trading stocks, etc.?
2639 2018-02-03 16:21:38 Go buy more stocks for 10% gains pr year... Good luck with that.
2640 2018-02-03 16:21:29 Dont know about index but a lot of stocks could do what they did on friday and maybe on a wider selection of stocks. Index could be managed by a fewer heavy weights the so called flight to safety
2641 2018-02-03 16:21:23 Investing in anything without research into what your investing is always going to be trash. A lot of penny stocks have potential for serious growth. Penny doesnt = shit company and about to be bankrupt
2642 2018-02-03 16:20:54 But the stocks went down yesterday? Why?
2643 2018-02-03 16:20:32 A bitch bout invest in stocks  and be smart
2644 2018-02-03 16:20:30 Didn't stocks take a 600 pt dip yesterday?
2645 2018-02-03 16:18:08 Is crypto why we still don't have OTC stocks available yet? We're y'all prioritizing crypto over letting me invest in Nintendo and Samsung? So now both crypto availability AND stock availability are half-baked....
2646 2018-02-03 16:17:27 The markets follow sentiment and lead of USA  @POTUS. Proven by history. When a Leader Leads USA, Stocks rise. #Obama  told the world  must diminish so all will rise. Stock market waffled. 

@realDonaldTrump says  is to be a rising example! #StockMarket rises.
2647 2018-02-03 16:17:25 Speculation is a part of any investment game, especially in eartly stage projects like cryptos. All cryptos are more like stocks. Stocks which coulbe used as currency in some cases.
2648 2018-02-03 16:17:21 Stocks  where levels were taken out  : Idea , Tata power , Ktk bank , Dcb Bank , Albk .
2649 2018-02-03 16:16:12 This is coming from a guy that blew up buying Nortel. That's the last time he's bought stocks!!
2650 2018-02-03 16:15:52 Not nearly as volatile or speculative. It’s pumping money into established money earning companies. Penny stocks are trash
2651 2018-02-03 16:14:26 Magasto ka para ha new phone gamit imo sweldo, kay kun gin.ivest mo ito nga kwarta ha VUL, MF, Bonds or Stocks then you can buy even better than that later on.

2653 2018-02-03 16:13:57 The analyst said #Market cld go up or down from here. I asked this same quest to my 4 year old & got the same reply. 

#stocks #stockmarket #NSE #nifty #banknifty
2654 2018-02-03 16:13:35 Improved economy means rising interest rates from fed to control inflation. Rising rates means better returns on non-equity investments. This means reduced demand for stocks and increased demand for bonds etc. Simply the expectation of reduced demand causes prices to adjust now.
2655 2018-02-03 16:13:33 Why aren't you talking about stocks dropping 600 pts?   Piece of shi that you are
2656 2018-02-03 16:13:31 Dude, can't you remember 2008 & that crash? Eventually it hits us all regardless if we have stocks or not. I knew this would happen soon as tax gifts for the rich hit. Occupy Wall Street needs to return & we need a POTUS who monitors Wall Street better.
2657 2018-02-03 16:13:29 How’s the weather in Florida? Golfing today? Children and adults are dying from the flu and you are cutting CDC budget including research. And, your “best people” hire bought tobacco stocks after being named to the CDC. Yep, enjoy your golf game.
2658 2018-02-03 16:13:10 Perfect scenario for Bitcoin in 2018: stocks start their 15% correction while Bitcoin is rallying 200%. Individuals holding stocks panic while seeking this, dump all stocks and go to Bitcoin. Unicorns are made!
2659 2018-02-03 16:13:09 OVERWATCH ENTERPRISES stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
2660 2018-02-03 16:12:46 Bruh nobody cares what your opinion is lmao the game is actually fun to watch cause big t is playing it and he don’t need YouTube views lmao he has his money from stocks and he’s killing in life.. wtf you doing? Not shit besides talking down on people. You equals irrelevant
2661 2018-02-03 16:11:20 I think the stock market is going to correct this year but finish higher than January 2. I think a huge crash in U.S. stocks in 2019 or 2020.
2662 2018-02-03 16:11:19 did Hillary and Obama hv a hand in stock market drop? How did they and their handful of puppets play there stocks lately?
2663 2018-02-03 16:10:49 Another one is using vage terms (volatility trading bot, uhum...) on how returns are made. And again stocks or crypto don't pay out crazy returns. Their value could rise 100x, but that's speculation not paying out actual daily interest of 1% each day.
2664 2018-02-03 16:10:44 #Bitcoin is the #Tesla of crypto with many FUDsters, shorters, trolls, haters, and cultish fanboys. $TSLA is the honey badger of stocks. it just keeps coming back, leaving weak hands #REKT in a #TsunamiOfHurt. that’s why i #HODLandChill both 
2665 2018-02-03 16:10:43 More money is good, but at what orice? What happened to our stocks today?did you pay for tax break with the 660+ PLUNGE in the stock market? Thank you very much! Give a dollar and take $100 away? Where did that money go to?
2666 2018-02-03 16:10:13 Stocks do the same thing. People hear hype, they pump money in it.
2667 2018-02-03 16:09:58 Precise and concise. Predict Stocks to rally by month end.
2668 2018-02-03 16:09:53 Either that or they have time constraints and disclosure rules etc. I've seen The Editor often say he holds particular Stocks.

If you can't handle this you should do normal stocks 
#crypto $btc $zcl $eth $ltc

2740 2018-02-03 16:04:28 A cricket coach chooses his team expecting each player to be a match winner

He doesn't select any tomdickharry just to complete 11

Similarly..all stocks in portfolio must be chosen for future performance

Diversify to maximize returns..not to reduce risk
2741 2018-02-03 16:04:21 Please change LTCG to 5% .It will prevent price manipulation and speculation in stocks otherwise ask Sebi take price rigging complaint seriously.
2742 2018-02-03 16:02:05 @StocksNJocks how much leverage is in the bond market and how do u leverage a bond portfolio to match returns from stocks?
2743 2018-02-03 16:01:55 80% of stocks are owners by millionaires.
2744 2018-02-03 16:01:36 I gotta stop playing with stocks
2745 2018-02-03 16:01:15 I fucking looked up the definition. And I copied and pasted it . And guess what , you can include cryptos , stocks , and anything where a group of people invest in at different time intervals and the value helps one and can hurt another . That’s a ponzi!!!
2746 2018-02-03 16:01:06 Usually I don't do Intraday that much as I don't want to play against time & to avoid Intraday Volatility.
But 210 odds FnO Stocks are great if want to trade Intraday & safe too.
2747 2018-02-03 16:00:39 Everything is in a bubble. Stocks, Crypto you name it.
But calling the pop now? Its far from over.
2748 2018-02-03 16:00:02 Yeah... some of these coins that give x1000 gains suck.. I'm sure there's stocks that give way bigger returns than that..
2749 2018-02-03 15:59:58 Even better is that the stocks were down 666 points...draw your own conclusions.
2750 2018-02-03 15:59:08 ......and still nothing has been done to punish Saudi Arabia for funding the largest terrorist attack on US soil. You know why? Because Saudi Arabia has oil and oil=money to the fat cats in Washington who own stocks in oil companies.
2751 2018-02-03 15:58:03 I never thought a "goal" of saving for Wizarding World of Harry Potter would be a hard one that took focus, but lately it has thanks to the temptations of Kate Spade purses and cheap dividend stocks.
2752 2018-02-03 15:57:28 You know the answer. Media barely acknowledged how well stocks have doen..but sure jumped on yesterday's stock drop.  They will NEVER print positives..the quicker you accept it the better off you will be. Americans are showing you approval so keep up the good work.
2753 2018-02-03 15:57:00 @RenukaJain6 ma'am i had invested sm money in equity market few weeks back net worth is almost half so can u plz suggest any funds or stocks to recover. Plz advise. Thanks
2754 2018-02-03 15:55:48 I see this bitcoin and futures stuff as Alibaba once was launched on stocks, bleed during months, consolidating a floor and then rally up
2755 2018-02-03 15:55:47 Hi Stephen, please check with the store manager regarding stocks and potential deliveries to replenish. Thank you.
2756 2018-02-03 15:55:25 No, it was me. I dumped all my millions of stocks and shares onto Wall St. 
2757 2018-02-03 15:54:49 So his approval rating goes from abysmal to just basically horrendous? That's terrific, Eric. Hope you sold your stocks last Thursday. Oh  Make Another Great Depression Again.
2758 2018-02-03 15:54:09 Higher wages causes inflation. The Fed raises interest rates to tamp down inflation, making bonds a more attractive investment relative to stocks. Stock market anticipating fewer buyers, more sellers as bonds yield goes up.
2759 2018-02-03 15:54:08 No tax relief is a small part,as any rebate would have given negligible few thousand in ur hand/month. What is hurting India is ur tax paid amount,invested for (nation building in stocks/ SIPs)one's long term goals like wedding, education, retirement is taxed, ruining ones dreams
2760 2018-02-03 15:54:08 I am totally against bump stocks and there are many large corporations that give money to politicians that needs to be fixed. I am 59 years old my first exposure to guns was in the Boy Scouts not the NRA. California gun owners are being infringed on.
2761 2018-02-03 15:52:16 Donald Trump, his complicit family, crooked cronies are just playing you, everyday he lied while lining his family pockets, his administration is all corrupt and making money trading stocks, some meeting with Russian aka Pompey, some paying family members for doing nothing #WOKE
2762 2018-02-03 15:52:00 And another news, during Friday’s Dow Jones free fall, men’s footwear stocks skyrocketed, as Republicans flooded shoe stores  nationwide after having shot themselves in their collective foot.
2763 2018-02-03 15:51:47 Welcome dear.. thanks for the pic. 
2764 2018-02-03 15:51:25 Dear Sir,

Can you suggest for some scanners for intraday trading?. How to track stocks for intraday movement.Thanks.
2765 2018-02-03 15:50:15 Good stocks are like tennis balls. They will bounce back. Rubbish stocks are like eggs. When they fall they splatter! In the next few weeks we will figure whether we have tennis balls or eggs in our portfolio.
2766 2018-02-03 15:48:26 It’s an assumption that people earn profits in bull markets. Some people who invest in particular stocks and sectors may have lost money in the bull market also. Will the govt give them rebates in their income tax for losses incurred in the markets. No !
2767 2018-02-03 15:47:25 Fake deep nonsense kills me. That's not how you invest looking for value. Most don't need to be in individual stocks priced that high in the FIRST damn place
2768 2018-02-03 15:47:20 What stocks  triggered the sell off Soros? Gates? Forbes? Europe?
2769 2018-02-03 15:46:18 Stocks at an all time high? Thanks, Obama!
2770 2018-02-03 15:46:01 pa -update naman ako if ever available na ulit? or may stocks na? interested po 
2771 2018-02-03 15:45:51 The same percentage drop as the stocks gets him to 47.75

“Young girls? Like me?” She walks towards the woman she referred as ‘eonnie’ before taking a seat on the table next to the weapon stocks.

2774 2018-02-03 15:44:22 And by the way real Trump in January black unemployment went up to 7.8 and stocks dropped yesterday 666 just like you and your whole family Ryan and nunes devils
2775 2018-02-03 15:44:18 Most people fail to create wealth in stocks simply because they don’t have a 

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY

Most profits remain on paper and a sell off like what we are seeing evaporates everything

HOW TO MANAGE
* Cash strategy 
* Diversification
* Options

2776 2018-02-03 15:44:04 Ok, the market reacted to the recent fed reserve meeting that suggested it may raise interest rates due to concerns about inflation . This caused investors to shift some funds out of stocks into treasuries which caused stock prices to drop .
2777 2018-02-03 15:44:02 People surprised stocks dropped... Meanwhile I've been sitting here nervous about inflation and a second serving of the great depression
2778 2018-02-03 15:43:12 Higher Yields will = lower stocks
2779 2018-02-03 15:41:02 @Hyundai_Global Señores yo compré un Ioniq en Guayaquil Ecuador en la casa Galmack y no tienen stocks de repuestos tengo 2 meses mi auto en el taller, pésimo servicio!!!!
2780 2018-02-03 15:40:55 Rough week? Stocks are back to where they were 3 weeks ago...
2781 2018-02-03 15:40:52 Expect more volatility stock market. Technically,,expect 200 more pts down Dow Jones. Short term, bull trap rallies. Expect ( my opinion) at near bottom confirmation: LESS THAN 10 stocks making new 52 week highs on the NY Stock Exchange. Otherwise still Bull market.
2782 2018-02-03 15:40:41 Senate idiots release memo, people with good reading comprehension read memo then sell stocks in favor of bonds. Those people understand the difference between hearsay, circumstantial evidence and hard evidence. They understand what an impeachment will do to the market -666.
2783 2018-02-03 15:40:01 I had thought marijuana stocks would be much higher:
We all need our nerves calmed and a happy place, cuz this trump regimes America isn’t, he’s put us to the point we can’t afford to move out of country even if we wanted to,
2784 2018-02-03 15:39:58 No he is not happy! He showing you how corrupt the DNC is and exposing them made the stocks go down!
2785 2018-02-03 15:39:36 Says the millionaire that probably owns his share of stocks and doesn't matter either way to him
2786 2018-02-03 15:37:34 @realDonaldTrump why so quiet about this? I thought you take credit for stocks
2787 2018-02-03 15:37:22 Do grandfathering rules also apply to stocks in which no STT paid on purchase like right issue, demerger,merger,bonus issue stock bought before STT was introduced? @FinMinIndia @IncomeTaxIndia
2788 2018-02-03 15:37:19 People Learn Quickly Money in Stocks is NOT Same as Money in The Bank~Or Will Soon... #fed #trump #msnbc #foxnews #wapo #nyt #wsj #cnbc #npr #cnn #politico #slate #drudge #wallstreet #huffpost #401k #ecb #nbc #history
2789 2018-02-03 15:37:03 I think it's intentional.  Scare the little guy into pulling out, let the market fall more, buy stocks at lower prices, profit.  It's unfortunate

2804 2018-02-03 15:29:51 Because those companies well way before Trump..... Thats why your 401k was invested into those stocks... And you're wrong exactly because of the reasons I noted previously
2805 2018-02-03 15:29:44 Canada's regulated commercial #cannabis industry is in its infancy. There are many more chapters to unfold. Anyone judging the future based on peaks and valleys in cannabis stocks should give their heads a shake.... #ACMPR #LongGame
2806 2018-02-03 15:29:37 So many new investors running around chasing/panicking. Most haven't been through a significant pullback yet. When things get back on track, we might be in for a nice rally.... the importance for holding quality stocks.
2807 2018-02-03 15:29:30 The same day the #FakeMemo was released, the stock market crashed 666 points!  You can’t make this stuff up!!!    #stocks #666 #MemoDayMassacre #MemoFail
2808 2018-02-03 15:29:14 Oh no my stocks!
2809 2018-02-03 15:28:20 Be careful though - highest stocks since 87 and lowest dollar rate since 87 - interest rates rising ... that could be setting up for a rough February.

2813 2018-02-03 15:27:31 No  it does benefit  workers at a very small rate.... the top 10 percent of people own most of the stocks ...
2814 2018-02-03 15:26:24 Actually you sound crazy and proved my point. If my 401k is tied to several different stocks and those stocks are up. How isn’t that attributed to some of trumps policies. My 401k is about over 10% so explain to me again how i am wrong.
2815 2018-02-03 15:25:50 Good stocks are like tennis balls. They will bounce back. Rubbish stocks are like eggs. When they fall they splatter! In the next few weeks you figure whether you have tennis balls or eggs in your portfolio !

#Sensex #Nifty
@BSEIndia @NSEIndia
2816 2018-02-03 15:25:39 So let’s review.  Democrats want higher taxes, socialized medicine, illegal felons roaming our streets, financial insecurity (decreased stocks and less in 401Ks), bigger government with less individual freedom, and a crooked police state in America.
2817 2018-02-03 15:25:07 I doubt inflation will be a problem. What is bad trillion $ deficits & unusual heavy borrowing by treasury , our sinking $ & resulting foreign boycott of Treasury auctions! Net result soaring rates! Expect bear markets for both bonds & stocks Margin buying will also dry up!.
2818 2018-02-03 15:24:09 Exactly because that's not how 401k works  your 401k is invested into different stocks and funds that are independent of regulation and go up based on how well the market does... The market has been on a bull run for the last 9 years so anymore snarky comments? 
2819 2018-02-03 15:22:58 The number that must just drive you crazy is the 666 drop in the #Market. Looks like the stocks aren’t happy with your actions today. Interesting that number is also the sign of the devil. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #TrumpsFailedMemo
2820 2018-02-03 15:21:43 And of course that's why the number is so low. The June 2008 high was characterized by a melt-up in oil prices and energy stocks and rampant enthusiasm for Alberta oil sands. And then oil crashed, not once but twice in six years.
2821 2018-02-03 15:21:13 Worry is that, if, they have brute majority again in 2019, they would add all profits generated through SIPs/Stocks to your income and make you pay 33%income tax when you retire  Rendering you to be at the mercy of Govt or children!!
2822 2018-02-03 15:20:19 Trumpettes need 2stop say’g Cheeto in Charge caused economy! It’s psychotic behavior. Obama rescued banking industry as first order of business.  If he hadn’t world’s economy would have tanked. And stocks up help the 1% primarily. $ goes to shareholders. Live-able wages r needed.
2823 2018-02-03 15:19:43 Its going to come crashing down like Bitcoin. The super rich are doing buybacks of their stocks and artificially inflating the market to make it look like we are okay with the economy
2824 2018-02-03 15:19:30 BTW,  stocks are DOWN AGAIN!
2825 2018-02-03 15:19:27 Same boat...very long energy and no intention to touch my holdings and short WTI for a trade. Outperforming can always mean falling less than oil on a pullback, which is my guess but we'll see. Whats clear to me though is theres major long-term upside for oil stocks
2826 2018-02-03 15:18:55 Today was the perfect example of why Trump tying his success to the stock market is a terrible idea. The stock market drop of 600 pts has nothing to do with Trump's tax cut. Do I have to remind you "stocks go up and stocks go down"?

2832 2018-02-03 15:14:56 I just read your letter. My heart breaks for you, I've been in the same situation. After a 20 yr marriage to an alcoholic, raised my daughter by myself, dealt with all the lies n embarrassing situations, I walked away loosing my house to foreclosure, my stocks n bonds every cent
2833 2018-02-03 15:14:32 Dear @muglikar_ I have a small query, pls ans if u can spare a little time, if I have over 5 lakhs invested in stocks for down payment of a house ( typical middle class scenario) I'll hv to pay ltcg tax of 10% on it right? So how's it not a burden on middle class?
2834 2018-02-03 15:13:51 Thanks for reading it. If the 2nd amendment stands with or without the NRA why do you imagine they give so much money to politicians? Is it to ensure proper gun safety legislation is enacted? Only 1 state has banned bump stocks post Vegas for instance

2838 2018-02-03 15:11:02 It doesn't ... the memo is #DevinsDud .... and Trump is just pi$$ed because stocks tanked yesterday.   The worse his day is .. the meaner he is on twitter .....  #DementiaDon
2839 2018-02-03 15:10:55 Energy stocks often lead
2840 2018-02-03 15:10:46 I’m just another Trump parody pointing out the obvious, but as for the stocks those are plummeting thx to Trump imposing tariffs that will cause domestic goods to go up in cost, and ultimately across the board inflation where consumers stop spending. He’s screwing up the economy.
2841 2018-02-03 15:10:36 Glenn, Democrats and all those who wanted lying Hillary to win, will of course talk shot on TRUMP!! TRUMP is very well liked and loved. He is Brilliant.

2847 2018-02-03 15:05:02 Canadian Pot Stocks went in 2018 feeling like they would rally into legalization and sell off on the event. Classic buy the rumor sell the news.

2850 2018-02-03 15:04:39 Trump's government instability sent investors away from Stock Market.  The games that the GOP and Trump are playing are affecting the stocks and in turn people's pocketbook.  On Friday, the Stock Market lost 665 points
2851 2018-02-03 15:04:34 Funny thing happened in 2018 - First #bitcoin and crypto coins corrected, #marijuana stocks were next, transportation stocks which were leading, and last the rest of the market including tech, bonds, and gold.  I won't argue bitcoin leads the market back, but who knows!
2852 2018-02-03 15:04:08 I wonder what those %s would look like for stocks?  No agenda, honest question. I bet there is large concentration in small % there as well.
2853 2018-02-03 15:04:02 a ratiocination is a stocks: accursed and peach-colored
2854 2018-02-03 15:04:01 Stocks tanked 666 points after that turdburger of a memo came out.
2855 2018-02-03 15:03:54 Ok, does everybody get it now? Wall Street hates Main Street! Stocks fell 666 points (an appropriate number) because workers wages had a small increase!!!  Let's make an economy that works for all of us, not just Trump's billionaire friends/contributors. #resist #Bernie2020
2856 2018-02-03 15:02:57 Agree.. but don't get your tweet.  You know why this isn't happening.  Russia laundered money through NRA to GOP.  Your tweet ultimately helps the GOP.  Instead, tweet "Russia.  NRA.  GOP.  No bump stocks ban.  Is there a connection?"
2857 2018-02-03 15:02:56 Massachusetts is the first state to. An bump stocks.
2858 2018-02-03 15:02:44 It is true the stock market and especially the Dow says nothing about the economy. But let’s not ignore fact that whether people own stocks or not, the market performance impacts consumer psyche and how people’s perceptions of the economy.

2861 2018-02-03 15:01:53 Stocks going down and 1000 dollars equate to 650 in after tax income, which is roughly 53 bucks a month for a year and then gone
2862 2018-02-03 15:01:49 absolutely. With such a strong fundamental in economy, in favorable policy in tax and deregulation, there's no better place to put your money than in stocks

2868 2018-02-03 14:59:42 Back in 2012 and 2013...the valuation of most of the stocks I hold now were 11X-14X...perhaps last three years our mind recaliberated itself to think of 18X-20X as right valuations...need for recalibration again?
2869 2018-02-03 14:58:11 Lol I thought the stocks were Obamas claim? 
Stocks fluctuate- thats common sense

- right to repair bill
- 15 firearm safety bills including a ban on bump stocks
2873 2018-02-03 14:55:25 Lockups give phony valuations, I've traded stocks for 30 years. Its manipulative, even if required by law.  Let the BTC holders dump #IDONTCARE!  #notworried. Markets will be markets. You are making a low quality argument.

How much lower would returns have been owning bonds?  Individual capacity for risk is important, right?
2876 2018-02-03 14:53:42 But But your stocks dropped 666 huuuum is this a sign of your bigley approval
2877 2018-02-03 14:53:41 Suggest a few such stocks 
2878 2018-02-03 14:52:44 Why have you refused to take credit for stocks falling?
2879 2018-02-03 14:51:34 And stocks.
2880 2018-02-03 14:51:26 Make a no stocks header ? 
2881 2018-02-03 14:51:24 With everything going on you're still worried about size you truly are Narcissus what about the stocks falling 666 I think it's a sign that you are the Antichrist
2882 2018-02-03 14:49:08 @sainsburys has the Islington branch mistakenly ordered stocks of bay leaves instead of lime leaves? I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get any there.

2884 2018-02-03 14:48:24 A large stock market correction would be fantastic news for the largest generation of Americans, who need to be buying stocks.
2885 2018-02-03 14:48:03 Unfortunately the correction will probably continue on into the summer going forward. When stocks become so over valued the correction is often twice as long as normal.
2886 2018-02-03 14:47:27 You can accumulate / average with some extra spare money of all profitable stocks.
2887 2018-02-03 14:47:12 Thing with stocks accounts u can withdraw your money vs gains being stuck in crypto exchange dark hole.
2888 2018-02-03 14:46:22 Absolutely!!  As many know, the stock market and economy don't move in tandem.  Some believe that a big tax cut on top of a very stimulative Fed monetary policy in a recovering economy is a recipe for inflation and rate hikes.  Those would be BAD for stocks and bonds.
2889 2018-02-03 14:45:13 That sounds like a great idea,  the police must love having armor piercing ammo on the street, good for their longevity and a Congress to thank,along with bump stocks, what could go possibly go wrong.
2890 2018-02-03 14:44:57 THEN WHY WAS @realDonaldTrump TAKING CREDIT THE WHOLE TIME THE STOCKS WERE UP?Do you think I believed he was the reason the stocks were up?No,I didn't,but that lying piece of sure did!Trump is a legend in his own demented mind...
2891 2018-02-03 14:44:30 Know this guy doesnt do stocks. This is a sell day lol tomorrow a buy day.

2893 2018-02-03 14:44:12 I've been following sunny for a few months now,  but watching his webinars are eye opening,  especially if you are new to penny stocks.   Slowed my futures, options, and forex trading to learn from sunny.. extremely insightful and worth your time!
2894 2018-02-03 14:44:08 This is nothing more than a market correction; like stocks, the contracts got out of control per value and this is correcting back to earth. Plus prime is not 30+ anymore
2895 2018-02-03 14:42:37 I'm imagining this poster commenting on Medieval equivalent of twitter: "If you don't pour this quicksilver down your child's throat...I'm having you put in the stocks."
2896 2018-02-03 14:42:36 No they just needed someone to blame so we blamed Iraq and proved it was money from Saudi. Because heaven forbid that people in congress lose the money and oil they get from Saudi by holding them responsible. Congress has a lot of Saudi Stocks look it up !
2897 2018-02-03 14:42:03 My dad is showing my mom how much interest the money he invested for her is growing in stocks. Love.

2900 2018-02-03 14:39:13 Stocks still higher*
2901 2018-02-03 14:39:12 Started the day with a brisk walk from home to church and vv, had taho, bond with my niece, did some groceries for our monthly stocks.. Grabe, tita na nga talaga ako! #mystressreliever
2902 2018-02-03 14:38:39 STOCK MARKET CORRECTION!  The 2018 stock market correction is here and will continue into next week. Some predicting up to a 15% drop in equity value. This correction has been predicted since Dec. 2017 as stocks are way overvalued!  Corrections are healthy for the stock market.
2903 2018-02-03 14:37:31 Dear @SenDeanHeller — 4 months ago today marked the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with 58 people slaughtered and yet the bill to ban bump stocks languished while you and your brethren huddle in silence in fear of the NRA.  #ENOUGH! Get on board and pass the bill!

2906 2018-02-03 14:35:31 Stocks still can higher than it ever has been under any other president
2907 2018-02-03 14:34:14 This is very true. The one thing that gets me though is if I sell my stocks It will be like taking a 3k yearly income pay cut and I'll be missing out on amazing market returns? It could end up costing me over 10k in a single year just to save 3k in taxes?
2908 2018-02-03 14:33:27 Does Miniso still have stocks of the We Bare Bears stuffed toys? 
2909 2018-02-03 14:33:04 je hebt mij stocks al gezien waar ik jou visie op wil hebben.
2910 2018-02-03 14:32:37 What if paying it off required me to sell my dividend stocks which produce for me yearly in just dividends enough to cover mortgage interest paid? That doesn't include investment return either?

2913 2018-02-03 14:31:39 How cool... My grandmother owned a lot of stocks. I have no idea which ones. She left all of her money to a children's hospital. She gave them a lot!   
2914 2018-02-03 14:31:38 AAA publishers who are sounding the micro transactions horn the loudest are also those who have the most money secured in overseas tax havens, the most valuable stocks, and the most diversified sources of income outside of just releasing games.
2915 2018-02-03 14:31:07 Fox&friends~ stocks went down bc of superbowl. Expensive to go& all the $$ bet on it. $$$ will be back on Monday. Lol
2916 2018-02-03 14:30:57 They want to fish MORE fish. Quotas to protect fish stocks prevent that.
2917 2018-02-03 14:30:05 How about that stock market?  Down 666 points. That’s MAGA!!!!  I actually have stocks.  This is impacting ME. You pale in so many ways to @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton

2933 2018-02-03 14:19:41 Huge contributor to 87 sell off was failure of outdated NYSE to handle volumes. Tape 40 min behind + many suspended stocks took arbitrageurs out of mkt.
2934 2018-02-03 14:19:28 Q:. Will the drop in stocks force a collapse in the storm?   Or prevent the truth from going public?Just asking........
2935 2018-02-03 14:19:28 Sir thank you for the explanation. Is SL always 1.25 times of ATR for all stocks? How is it for index, futures and lastly options ? Thx
2936 2018-02-03 14:19:14 They need to hurryup extending to other states with stocks crashing atleast investors can focus on cryptocurrencies
2937 2018-02-03 14:19:08 Don't forget the market. Monday should be interesting. Should come back a litttle.  Then Tuesday!  The rally was being supported by fewer & fewer stocks. Finally collapsed.
2938 2018-02-03 14:19:07 I suspect their manpads stocks are huge as well,since they don't care to leave them behind,its just they had no chance to use then yet
2939 2018-02-03 14:18:57 Indeed. I don’t have stocks, but I sure contribute to the economy. #shopaholic
2940 2018-02-03 14:18:51 What hope is there for long-term wage increases, if stocks tank with every rise in pay?
2941 2018-02-03 14:18:32 Which just goes to Keynes’ point about speculative markets and underscoring the fact that stocks have long since ceased to be an investment vehicle.

IF public companies were required to issue dividends corresponding to their stock price THEN stock prices would be indicators.
2942 2018-02-03 14:18:24 It's a casino but right now it's terribly abnormal w flat-line vix. Corps buying back their own stocks,will profit taking come? That's when everyday folks take a big hit. The bubble can only get so big until it bursts. Meantime government can down hard on Wells Fargo. 1/2
2943 2018-02-03 14:17:18 Sorry I misunderstood - i thought you are looking for stocks to short, like LICHF.
2944 2018-02-03 14:17:09 Stocks falling and ocean temps rising. Hmmm! It's gotta be because of @realDonaldTrump 
2945 2018-02-03 14:16:37 PREACHING: Time for play after yesterday's #StockMarket decline? May I suggest that everyone should be looking at global markets, sector charts, indices, IR and individual stocks.

2950 2018-02-03 14:14:16 When #qanon talked Jan 27 "Who controls the controllers"; likely plan on words for Comptrollers. Where, Govt appointee will vote best interests of stocks held via @realDonaldTrump EO on assets of Human Rights abusers. Think Twitter @Jack @LarrySchweikart
2951 2018-02-03 14:13:36 Fully agree with u on this.But robing John to pay Jack is not a wise move.Wen the number of people paying tax has increased,there should have been relief to those honest guys. Instead there is increase in their tax by cess& their systematic investments in SIPs/stocks taxed 
2952 2018-02-03 14:11:53 Was in response to the second part of your question being "are there any more out there and being the golden stocks for the bull"
2953 2018-02-03 14:11:21 It's good time to adjust the portfolio and add high conviction stocks to the portfolio. LTCG will not change the definition of Investing. Buy quality business at decent price and hold till business is doing good. Time to add those quality stocks.
2954 2018-02-03 14:10:35 When stocks are , Bonds , make sure you are diversifying your 401k to keep that "see saw" level
2955 2018-02-03 14:09:16 A jewellery box and a sin box all for the one grand opening price. Hurry while stocks last!
2956 2018-02-03 14:09:04 Agreed... Now volumes will be more with more fluctuations. Quality stocks will be on the radar now. Government had this in mind while proposing the new capital gains tax structure. However "grandfathered concept ," was not the need...
2957 2018-02-03 14:08:42 I’m sure the crash will be the fault of index investors....if only people would pick stocks instead
2958 2018-02-03 14:07:44 I had a dream last night that I helped @andrewcarvalho buy Nintendo stocks and we were gonna share the proceeds of it, which would be a pretty good deal if I knew how to buy stocks.

2961 2018-02-03 14:04:28 And look what sectors sold off. Early cycle stocks... retail sector. Higher sga but no pricing power. Means lower ebit margin
2962 2018-02-03 14:02:18 MF are regularly buying and selling stocks...they’re paying tax on profits from that...and customer is again paying tax on selling MF units....Case of double taxation?
2963 2018-02-03 14:01:59 Stick with Stocks and your frightful 2% drops. Lmao

2965 2018-02-03 14:01:30 Saw a headline yesterday that said something like "stocks plunge after rates shoot up due to improving economy."
Plunge 2% during a upward trend.  Shoot up = 0.25%.  Isn't a good economy good for stocks?

2971 2018-02-03 13:57:13 Thread for available stocks Hurry up girlssss nanti melepasss hehe 
2972 2018-02-03 13:56:41 Govt is a fool if it thinks it is encouraging one class by not leving taxes . How much % of ppl invest in stocks & what % of their portfolio vis realestate .need to drive ppl away from fascination of realestate as investment than Only it will be affordable. U r culling baby !!
2973 2018-02-03 13:55:04 I was sick watching him he was actually giddy that stocks were down ! I guess workers 401k’s don’t matter to him as long as he thinks trump is doing bad
2974 2018-02-03 13:54:18 facts; the market will have a correction, always does, interest rates will return to historic norms, the stock market is a gamble, but usually pays off in the long run, the key is diversification between stocks & bonds el al
2975 2018-02-03 13:53:48 When are people going to realise it was a scam. All the people who made millions have dumped stocks the ceiling was 20000
2976 2018-02-03 13:53:34 Dow dropping, layoffs happening.... Tax incentive helping billionaires buy more stocks...

2978 2018-02-03 13:51:10 @jimcramer Jim....What is the stock market Super Bowl indicator telling us?  What happens to the market if New England wins?  Or Philly wins?  It’s probably bad for stocks if philly wins, because I have not heard you talk about the indicator.
2979 2018-02-03 13:49:18 Until stocks last. There’s a few left
2980 2018-02-03 13:48:39 On the global front, Asian stocks will on Monday, 5 February 2018 react  to the US nonfarm payrolls data and US unemployment rate data for  January 2018 which will be unveiled on Friday, 2 February 2018.
2981 2018-02-03 13:48:02 You wishing this were true does not make it true.  Stocks will bounce back once criminals are dealt with.
2982 2018-02-03 13:47:56 It's the return of the conventional wisdom, let's not hope with a vengeance. That said, what happens if stocks come under pressure during  the presidency of a guy who defines success in terms of rising stock prices?
2983 2018-02-03 13:46:54 Why didnt you mention another 1st.  Stocks falling over 600pts in 1 day
2984 2018-02-03 13:46:53 VIX spiked. That might be it? What will Monday bring? Glad I’m flat stocks. But saw Warning signs days ago and didn’t act. Cudda ss stocks, ss calls, long tbt. Long uvxy.  Market was parabolic and signs of acceptance of Rally.
2985 2018-02-03 13:44:43 When people who have never invested decide they want to open accounts and buy cannabis stocks that's a pretty big message it's a market that has to come down. Never mind all the money raised,  share issues, new debt, acquisitions on inflated prices etc.
2986 2018-02-03 13:44:05 When 10%LTCG is to be paid then why all r selling their stocks at even 20%less price?
2987 2018-02-03 13:42:52 What the picture doesn’t show is you scraping up crumbs off the ground trying to have enough to eat to survive after you lost all your money shorting stocks. I felt sorry for you so I was giving you a few of the bucks I made from investing in $afmd.

2991 2018-02-03 13:36:47 Fun fact after Friday's big drop in stock #markets 

The Dow Jones industrial avg is still up 80% from its pre-financial-crisis high point (reached in 2007)

German stocks are up about 58%

Canadian stocks (TSX composite) are up 3.5%. 

A 3.5% gain over nearly 10 years...
2992 2018-02-03 13:34:32 U.S. stocks slumped Friday, and the market suffered its worst week in two years, as fears of inflation and disappointing quarterly results from technology and energy giants spooked investors. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by more than 650 points.
2993 2018-02-03 13:33:39 Most people lose money trading stocks/coins going down. Panic buying high and selling low! #reversepsychology #emotion
2994 2018-02-03 13:32:56 The opportunity in this space is tremendous. People I know fight tooth and nail over 1% in stocks. We’ve never seen anything like this. Learn the space and master it.
2995 2018-02-03 13:32:50 To be fair, market had given warning through January (I spoke about it for 3 to 4 days) about midcap carnage. Now good stocks will fall along with junk, so investors will soon get good buying opportunity
2996 2018-02-03 13:31:53 Hindi ko lang alam yung list ng mga meron na, pwede mong hintayin na magkaroon ng stocks sa bookstores ninyo.
2997 2018-02-03 13:30:59 Your better off owning some Twitter. It's a platform that your currently using. Use Robin hood app to avoid fees to buy stocks
2998 2018-02-03 13:30:58 Stocks crushed amid biggest weekly dip in 2 years
2999 2018-02-03 13:30:57 I say bring back the stocks in the market place & give free reign to the public to do whatever they like (with their crimes put on a billboard next to them). Then send whatever’s left of them to jail.
3000 2018-02-03 13:30:51 rising rates become a direct competition for stocks, as well as reducing corporate income.....stocks can still rise during periods of higher int. rates, but gains will likely be minimal
3001 2018-02-03 13:30:23 @varinder_bansal  as a complimentary please suggest few stocks because after some you will have restrictions to disclose in public
3002 2018-02-03 13:29:45 Tar and feather them, put in stocks, in the middle of town squares! Hang a couple of 'em and horse whip the rest! After the damage they've done we'll have to start from scratch! Good ole American Justice!! 
3003 2018-02-03 13:29:40 Stocks still up from when Trump took office

3006 2018-02-03 13:28:13 I had a dream my stocks went up 1,000% the day after I sold them. If that’s not a nightmare idk what is.
3007 2018-02-03 13:27:03 For 8 years stocks were in bubble because no economy supporting it. Just Fed. Now bubble because economy getting too strong. Set and forget.

3013 2018-02-03 13:21:42 After the Friday's correction. Small caps and midcaps 1 year gains are 27% and 24 % respectively. Which look reasonable. Any dip would be a great buying opportunity in quality stocks.

3015 2018-02-03 13:19:13 Dont sell ur stocks if they hv good fundamentals. This is a period where mkt removes weak hands. This happens periodically & ppl who sell are the ones who miss out on earning big. Chupchap apni holdings pe baithe raho aur wait karo.

Don't time the market else mkt will timeout U.
3016 2018-02-03 13:18:49 Yes but I find this message tragic. Bump stocks? Can't we do better?
3017 2018-02-03 13:18:41 I didn't get a bonus or any other benefit from my employer! And my stocks lost money Friday! Unemployment has been dropping for years and I still know people without jobs! Thanks Don!
3018 2018-02-03 13:15:46 Both the stocks are good for evaluation now
3019 2018-02-03 13:13:02 Nah...it’s just the bonds (10 yr treasury) finally paying interest rates attractive enough for some people to switch from stocks to bonds. #options
3020 2018-02-03 13:11:53 Thanks for the investment advice. I don't buy or short stocks I tweet about.  I tweet about $OSTK and chicken boy as a public service and because it gives me pleasure to annoy hypocrites like  Cohodes, who pumped while he dumped last month. PS I block morons, which includes you.
3021 2018-02-03 13:11:45 since the brexit vote we are losing 200million a week, so you do the maths. you like figures so much. And if you take all the fish out of the area, then you have to cut your fleet. They have controlled the catch to bring fish stocks back up.

3025 2018-02-03 13:10:17 Yeah, yeah, stock markets don't like political uncertainty
You know what else they don't like?

3026 2018-02-03 13:09:06 Well several analysts predicted this early in the week & said a correction was coming...I personally believe it happened Friday bcuz no one was “looking”...everyone was fixated on the “Memo” so it was a good time to dump stocks @FoxBusiness @seanhannity @Varneyco 
3027 2018-02-03 13:08:47 Not an economist. But all income is taxable right? There are also some stocks where folks lose money. Will this not discourage risk capital?

3032 2018-02-03 13:06:30 So called ‘ Non event Budget ‘ & long term focused budget, has created havoc in stock market along with global turmoil, this  will continue for while backed by rising rates, oil prices and daunting task to contain fiscal def, great chance for investors to pick quality stocks ..

3038 2018-02-03 13:03:14 Solid article but many other reasons why stock market down; $ down means imports cost more, expensive stock market on any valuation, longest stretch w/o decline, rising interest rates and deficits et. al. Increased wages eventually mean people buy more stuff-good for cos./stocks.

3044 2018-02-03 12:53:25 The patterns in Pot stocks last week is in line with margin call selling. Very large moves at the open against a mainly retail investor base. Stocks were difficult to buy on lows Friday. Its reasonable to suspect further margin calls Monday followed by a hard base if not rally.
3045 2018-02-03 12:53:13 Your Healthcare isn't going up because of Obamacare! What kind of business owner are you that you don't even know economic facts. Did you not see Health Care stocks tank on the market the other day?
3046 2018-02-03 12:53:06 How'd that memo work out for you??  You, .@DevinNunes and every other nut job are now laughing stocks of the entire country, congrats!
3047 2018-02-03 12:51:56 I haven’t even looked at individual stocks to see what took big hits or volume numbers. So I’m really not worried about shit going belly up anytime soon.

3061 2018-02-03 12:40:45 After such a down move, if you are buying stocks then wait for 1 or 2 full weeks .. If buying call options, then wait for 2 to 3 full weeks.. This is again an observation..
3062 2018-02-03 12:40:15 I’m not claiming one firm is better than the other. Claim is This is the type of commercial you see at market tops. Buy stocks they always go up make more money than your brother in law...

3068 2018-02-03 12:35:17 I unfollowed @StockTraderalph a while back. The more I read his posts the more I'm convinced it's some 17 year old kid pumping stocks from his mom's basement. Most of his content makes 0 sense. Bizarre pie in the sky commentary and statements.
3069 2018-02-03 12:33:32 I agree with you, but still their way of evaluating even stocks always follow mainly the financial aspects and trends. To evaluate crypto projects at the current market stage you need to have a deeper understanding of the technology behind it and the growth potential of adoption

3072 2018-02-03 12:29:39 A lot of what we’ve seen recently is companies buying back their own stocks now that the regulations have been cut. So it looks like all kinds of action but it’s just a redistribution of wealth. The drop is just the settling of those moves and a bit of foreign invest. Backing off

3077 2018-02-03 12:26:00 Stocks are literally a scorecard between capital and human beings. Stocks are soaring, people are suffering.
3078 2018-02-03 12:25:53 The problem is that people are investing in stocks without knowing how price earnings multiples work

3089 2018-02-03 12:14:40 I think better strategy would be book partial loss put this money in agri stocks and cover the loss and make some profit too or else keep waiting for train to catch and train won't stop. I know booking loss  sounds idiotic but sometimes you have to cut gangrened limb to survive.

3113 2018-02-03 11:53:26 The last few months the anti-Trumpers have been trying to get people to discount the idea of economic growth with the refrain. “The Stock Market is not the Economy”. But dropping stocks quickly put an end to that. And yes it’s Trumps’ fault.

3144 2018-02-03 11:25:59 I request MR. Adhia and Mr. Jaitley that as you tax 10% on profit as it is an effortless money, please bear d loss also, if I may suffer in stocks or MFs. 

Allow me to adjust that loss into my personnel Income Tax returns. 

Who told you that people only make profits in market?

3146 2018-02-03 11:23:28 Not really my friend. Stocks are also mostly based on expectations. 
Tesla marketcap is around general motors cap although Tesla production is 5% of GM . Many similar examples. So it is driven mostly by expectations as well.

3151 2018-02-03 11:19:02 @blockchainpowr Assuming a projected mining rate of 90 BTC/day x 365 at the current $11,000 CAD per BTC, that gives an EPS of $1.64. At 10x forward earnings, the price difference from $0.41 to $16.40 could make BPWR.V one of the hottest Canadian stocks to invest in for 2018.

3167 2018-02-03 10:58:17 In case of stocks one may hold for more than 5 years. But in case of Govt nobody is willing to give a 2nd term. Lets go back to the old devils & get looted again. And our children would still be living in a socialist/ leftist India.
3168 2018-02-03 10:55:15 how many of retail investors know tht when stocks are falling and they r losing money. expert traders make money by playing sell-- so in both ways when market goes up or down expert traders make money - market falls many times due to this game -- though Ind stocks were overbought
3169 2018-02-03 10:54:07 Bezos sold 10billion worth of his stocks in the summer, part of which he will presumably invest in the second Amazon HQ. It is very wise to liquidate some/all holdings at ATH to reinvest. I have more faith in LTC future knowing that the devs won't go broke during the bear.

3174 2018-02-03 10:47:10 Before the markets open on Monday it’s a good idea to know where support/resistance levels are for your stocks. Keep an eye on what’s showing strength and moving up on any market pullbacks. What are the leaders doing?
3175 2018-02-03 10:46:50 I agree stocks are not picked by the wayside but by some vision of growth, vision of product excellence vision in ability of management to innovate etc.based on A. Lot of research,this for the investors and along with it does not a Lot of underhand games connivance with companies

3188 2018-02-03 10:36:47 Also, no idea on your investment plans, but consider that you’re liable to Capital Gains Tax on everything above £10k-ish. If there’s potential to earn more than that, wrap it in a stocks and shares ISA - profits on that aren’t liable to CGT

3213 2018-02-03 10:12:43 The Dow tumbled 666 points Friday — its sixth-biggest point loss ever — and suffered its worst week in two years as investors turned skittish about spiking interest rates, dashing much of the optimism that had been powering stocks to record heights.

3215 2018-02-03 10:08:40 While buying stocks, you pay 0.10% STT. 

While buying MF units you don’t pay any STT directly. 

However when a scheme buy or sell any stocks they pay 0.10% STT.

3230 2018-02-03 09:43:44 My idea for novices is to accumulate dividend paying PSU n other stocks in this fall as this may be bear phase of bull run for another 2 years

3241 2018-02-03 09:30:32 Be carefull when someone shouts diversified, because they usually are not. Look at all the so called long/neutral only trendfollowers in stocks over the last years, sure they did great, but what about correlation risk, overall portfolio heat, etc?! There´s more to diversification
3242 2018-02-03 09:30:20 I'm sitting with money,  hopefully stocks that I'm planning to buy are good n growth oriented!

3270 2018-02-03 09:07:46 That is terrible behaviour. They should be named, shamed and banned from the town centre. Or given community service cleaning the toilets for a couple of months. Someone on a separate thread suggested stocks. No rotten fruit though only dirty nappies to throw I would suggest. 
3271 2018-02-03 09:06:15 so if i wanted to buy stocks i could do that though right?...but not crypto...
3272 2018-02-03 09:03:40 1. LTCG tax of 10% on capital gains over Rs.1 lakh only. Cover middle & Lower Middle class.
2. LTCG is indexed..... to cater for inflation and to encourage people on long term investing in stocks (just like taxation on property gains).
3. Cuts stock manipulations and black money

I do not see any extreme undervaluation in stocks
3282 2018-02-03 08:51:56 This ‘foolishness’ applies to any form speculation or investment as in property & stocks. It’s certainly the primary motive and also gullibility & frailty of the human race. Who wishes to buy high & sell low ? 
3283 2018-02-03 08:51:43 Aren't you the guy that attacked who was then and now the most popular guy in Congress? Talk about backing the wrong metaphrorical horse, man. PS: how're those pharma stocks doing since a mere 3 companies decided medical care is out of control?
3284 2018-02-03 08:51:43 Howabout them stocks 
3285 2018-02-03 08:49:48 The shooter bought his guns and ammunition legally. So we don't know whether he would have bought bump stocks if they were illegal. Making them illegal will certainly deter some people.
3286 2018-02-03 08:49:27 Very sad and horrible indeed. But banning bump stocks is not the answer.  Don’t take my rights away because of a sick individual. That’s a very slippery slope.
3287 2018-02-03 08:49:13 It could be the answer to stocks in the south as well .  #stuffthecarbonfootprint @PureCommodities

3290 2018-02-03 08:48:03 Dividend from stocks are already taxed as corporate income tax and further as DDT. 
Rental income needs to be compared to Dividends and not LTCG
Stock investors anyway pay STT on the total value of the contract

3297 2018-02-03 08:43:06 @PrabhuChawla What's the problem with 10 % tax on the GAINS and that too over Rs. 1 lakh which is still tax free? Why should some incomes not be taxed? As it is too much money is chasing stocks. There are unfair presumptive taxes in our laws which are not questioned.

3301 2018-02-03 08:42:08 Not. It was unsustainable. Falsely rising as big companies used tax savings to buy back their own stocks in January, driving prices up. We just witnessed another enormous transfer of wealth from the little guy to the big guy. Now they’ll use this drop to buy more stock, on sale.
3302 2018-02-03 08:41:53 it's kinda weird that i'm psyched about the stock market doing poorly but also like fuck anyone who owns stocks
3303 2018-02-03 08:38:11 Good stocks are like tennis balls. They will bounce back. Rubbish stocks are like eggs. When they fall they splatter! In the next few weeks you figure whether you have tennis balls or eggs in your portfolio.

3306 2018-02-03 08:36:45 Many people and cos made tens and hundreds of crores in stocks, without paying penny in taxes. (a small amt of stt) that's also a fact!
3307 2018-02-03 08:35:53 Wow, I guess y'all are to stupid to own stocks. Most probably don't even know what stock is.  God, yall really are infantile and not too sharp to say the least. The stock market doesn't have political parties and it's shocking how y'all could want Amerca to fail because of Trump.
3308 2018-02-03 08:35:10 @OasisFashion hi I’ve been trying to get hold of cherry premium jeans in S leg. They aren’t on the website anymore. Where stocks them please? Thanks
3309 2018-02-03 08:33:27 Your analysis is stupid... it’s natural for tech stocks to rise and fall sharply due to many factors including liquidity vs inflation concerns... this money is being cashed out then reinvested once these folks see what is worth investing in. Normal shifts in markets...
3310 2018-02-03 08:32:18 He wasn't aiming for much of it, just doing mag dumps into the crowd. That speeds it up as well. You're right on the big point, my more direct one was that given the fact set, the bump stocks were, in practice, irrelevent.
3311 2018-02-03 08:31:03 Had nothing to do with it, but u don't invest, I hope for ur sake, and obviously know nothing about stocks or the economy.
3312 2018-02-03 08:30:48 For people who don't understand economics or stocks 

When something is on a continuous rise over a long period of time it can only do but 1 thing, make a huge drop

Look at bitcoin, it just kept going up and up but then it could only go down

3321 2018-02-03 08:24:33 @chrislhayes Agreed! There is half the number of stocks today than in mid 90s.  It's the classic supply demand phenomenon.  More money chasing fewer stocks.  Spread the word.

3331 2018-02-03 08:21:22 I highly recommend Silver/Gold as a other way to hedge your bets against dollar/stocks/bonds/real estate/crypto
3332 2018-02-03 08:20:36 I bought a shitload of silver as a hedge against dollar/stocks. Bought a bunch at 35$ then bought even more at 15$ when the gold silver ratio was 80 in December of 2015 I think. I sold some to get into bitcoin but when I cashed out my original btc investment I bought it back.
3333 2018-02-03 08:20:27 Undoubtedly higher taxation will reduce the net earnings in the hands of investors. But that doesn’t mean you can discard the equity as an asset class.goid that now you will get a chance to buy stocks at lower price. Keep SIPing
3334 2018-02-03 08:19:42 I love it! We need to whole global economy to collapse, the stock markets to crash to the ground, and China to implode. Maybe then the Trumpsters will wake up and turn on Trump. Sick of the GOP using tax cuts, stocks and the economy as a shield.
3335 2018-02-03 08:19:24 They're not the only firm to do that.

3344 2018-02-03 08:11:51 You are so right. Banning clips that hold a zillion bullets, bump stocks and semi automatic weapons would not negate the 2nd amendment. How about just a little common sense.

Maybe comparsion should have been to 100% stocks buy and hold

3394 2018-02-03 07:21:29 I started investing in stocks and mutual funds only since 2003-04. So then does the government think that they have promoted the investment sufficiently and needn't be promoted further? Actually this is a further squeeze of the middle class who wants to gain from the market.
3395 2018-02-03 07:17:24 Commodities stocks will follow commodity cycle and probably limited room downward from base?  Unless commodities go down?
3396 2018-02-03 07:16:59 If stocks go down and Crypto starts to recover, we'll likely face another bull run. If not, we're all doomed and end up buying beanie babies and tulips. #cryptocurrency #crypto #StockMarketCrash #BTC #Bitcoin
3397 2018-02-03 07:13:32 What goes up...must come down. 1% are setting suckers up by buying stocks low and selling high.
3398 2018-02-03 07:09:05 They had their train crash, stocks today, obstacles at every turn. The negative energy surrounding this WH is building and about to explode. Either way, religion or universe, we will prevail. Will have a shit ton of cleanup to do.
3399 2018-02-03 07:07:59 THERE’S ONLY ONE REASON SESSIONS+TRUMP WANT TO GET RID OF WEED, CAUSE IT WORKS+THEY CAN’T BUY “DRUG STOCKS” ON IT & "BENEFIT PERSONALLY BY BILLIONS ON THE STOCKS!” THAT’S THE “ONLY” REASON! ANY DOUBT ANYONE ABOUT THAT ONE!!? DON’T THINK FOR A MINUTE TRUMP+CRONIES DON’T SMOKE IT!!

3403 2018-02-03 07:01:36 #cryptocurrency is indeed a revolution but it is falling out by not encorporating hortizontally and vertically. This is proved to exhibit similar signs and problems which currency and stocks had. Benefiting the few in huge ways. #bitcoincrash
3404 2018-02-03 07:01:12 Hope he enjoys this upswing because as the stock market dropped so will his numbers. But stocks will probably rebound..

3411 2018-02-03 06:54:03 There's an eerie silence on all Stock market related Whatsapp groups. Everyone was a raging bull couple of days back. This is what happens if the recent bull market was your first taste of stocks; and its not really a good correction yet. More on its way.

3412 2018-02-03 06:52:16 Some interesting stocks but liquidity is too low on these stocks. Can be easily manipulated. I would stay out of them.

3414 2018-02-03 06:51:40 8 more months to payoff so I'm good, thanks...think I will be switching to bonds for a bit instead of mutual funds/stocks.

3416 2018-02-03 06:48:55 Indeed. My dad’s retirement account is tied up in stocks. I’m in crypto primarily.
3417 2018-02-03 06:48:54 fund managers are taking fee for doing that even if alpha is negative. He is talking about investor who is earning money by investing in stocks. Why that profit should not get taxed as corporate pay the tax? Theses days industrialist were investing in shares rather into business.

3423 2018-02-03 06:46:17 Good stocks can be bought at any levels.
3424 2018-02-03 06:45:40 Made a pretty good decision selling ALL my stocks off yesterday before market close. Markets tanked today on the interest rate fears for some reason.
3425 2018-02-03 06:45:27 Ok. I get what you mean, it’s more like stocks (though imprecisely)
Because you don’t use these to transact pedestrian business...

But using “crash” to describe the plummet in value of bitcoin IS apt.
It describes a decline experts don’t expect to recover...
3426 2018-02-03 06:44:41 What's the logic behind day traders being afraid of #LTCG ? They don't hold stocks even for 365 minutes.
3427 2018-02-03 06:44:08 Gotta minute to discuss my stocks?

In 2008 777 point drop was 7%. $Yuge difference. Not interested in high PE stocks, regardless of "hype".  #Dow666

3455 2018-02-03 06:21:42 Stocks down by 666 points, is Trump going to finally admit he’s the fucking Anti-Christ?!
3456 2018-02-03 06:21:19 Good stocks are like tennis balls. They will bounce back. Rubbish stocks are like eggs. When they fall they splatter! In the next few weeks you figure whether you have tennis balls or eggs in your portfolio.
3457 2018-02-03 06:21:13 For a person like me having lost so much in stocks this statement is foolish.
3458 2018-02-03 06:20:33 Y’all really don’t know how stocks work huh  y’all so hurt over trump you can only attack his supporters now
3459 2018-02-03 06:20:27 I made a post about mine a while back. I use an excel spreadsheet to keep track of all my fabric stocks. I’m glad I made it. It really helps.
3460 2018-02-03 06:19:52 I’m guessing numbers were run. But in my spare I came up with 10 mil subs at $10 a month =$100 mil. So in a year that’s 1.2b. Plus residuals stocks up etc. even half the first year is still 600mil.
3461 2018-02-03 06:19:50 I just don't get them. I play with stocks, doing amazing with one I got in low on, leveling out/meh on others. When I talk to people about it I'm not scared they're gonna yell at me

Already some early sign of anger.

Hope some sense prevails...

3475 2018-02-03 06:06:00 Low rates caused people to buy homes and use plastic to buy a better life. Buying stocks has nothing to do with that. Companys were saved because if low interest rates. It save you from a recession. DF from bad loans. The Stockmarket is just pay to play
3476 2018-02-03 06:03:38 I am not sure about you but i see this as opportunity to buy stocks at discount or average it down.

6) mispriced stocks - most people ignore probabilities and exaggerate risks
3529 2018-02-03 05:21:45 Whose economy? Of large investors touting Mauritius money or the 60% poor who have no money to invest in stocks?
3530 2018-02-03 05:21:04 Stocks are crazy they Go Up on Weak Jobs Data & Go Down Big On Strong Jobs Data. 
Moral : Rational Behavior Won't make you money in Markets. Stay Foolish.
3531 2018-02-03 05:20:51 D’oh!
3532 2018-02-03 05:20:50 @christopherbrecher remember how the 1987 crash was triggered by Fed raising rates . They love to raise rates and deflate stocks.
3533 2018-02-03 05:20:17 670 point down today. A market correction much needed #DowJones #markets #stocks

3536 2018-02-03 05:14:21 Absurd, Make up your own minds, Opinions are like @ssholes, everyone has one. Markets bottom when they bottom, not before.  I've traded stocks for 30 years, this statement has always been true.
3537 2018-02-03 05:14:16 Looking forward to it honestly. It is still early in the game for investors, and I look forward to the hype that this industry will bring once it becomes more mature and makes sense to the majority of the America. #Marijuanastocks #stocks #EntreDupe #entrepreneur
3538 2018-02-03 05:13:59 Really. After the 666 point drop in the stocks market, you may want to examine yourself....and start praying.
3539 2018-02-03 05:11:52 Hardly, Buying stocks or Crypto is CRAZY and should never be permitted in Anyway, Calling if fighting back is Absurd! Never should have been!
3540 2018-02-03 05:10:41 -666 it’s a sign to all Christians to sell their stocks and donate the money to the needy.
3541 2018-02-03 05:10:36 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3542 2018-02-03 05:10:26 Especially all those stocks whose rises were praised as 'phenomenonal' run on channels !! Some portfolio managers have smartly used channels and social media for gains !!! Those who made money lucky...those who r stuck will not manage to save capital...
3543 2018-02-03 05:09:15 means they r holding them tight . major fall is in illiquid retail centric stocks i guess ..
3544 2018-02-03 05:09:12 Exactly, feel good is something different and if its going down it’s time to start more research to find some potential stocks.
3545 2018-02-03 05:08:21 I hope you're stocks fucking tank you stockholding bitches
3546 2018-02-03 05:08:16 Bump stocks are marketed to these militia member, operator wannabes, with budget AR-15 builds. Makes them forget that they failed in life, and have lil dicks.
3547 2018-02-03 05:08:03 Lost against a Lucas who had really bad neutral but I lost 3/4 of my stocks to PK Thunder gimps under 70%
3548 2018-02-03 05:07:18 But it won't happen here, you're right. And not even rudimentary measures like training for licensure like cars because a minority of gun owners and the gun lobby refuse to concede anything. Not even fucking bump stocks. So congrats. You people have won.
3549 2018-02-03 05:06:04 Hey trump you the stupid one hearing and believing fox news and britbart now you and the idiots of republicans are the laughing stocks also you guys are freaking embarrassment to this nation I find it disgusting looking at you besides you lost full respect from the Americans
3550 2018-02-03 05:05:57 Have you wondered about selection of stocks for the ticker tapes on some channels?
3551 2018-02-03 05:04:22 Welcome to the @realDonaldTrump Economy. Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft reports mostly positive and still stocks take a #TrumpDump. Just wait until there is real bad news #HelloHoovervilles
3552 2018-02-03 05:02:42 Youre crashing your precious stock market, #treasontrump wirh your obviously guilty behavior. Youre scaring the shit put of skittish investors, who cant stand thr thought of instability. This latest stunt shows in the fall off of stocks.
3553 2018-02-03 05:02:23 Makes sense. You're buying on credit. You can't buy stocks and bonds on credit unless it's a margin account. Nothing new here, just clickbait.
3554 2018-02-03 05:01:51 Resting Stocks face
3555 2018-02-03 05:00:46 Not so much. Most people don't own stocks. Speculation is that it's about inc wages possibly triggering inflation. Could hurt the 1%'s bottom line.
3556 2018-02-03 05:00:24 Dems turning stocks to cash for the dash to the border.

3561 2018-02-03 04:59:33 Oh I’m sure I’ve dropped stocks to each person at least once except one or two people. No idea about games though.
3562 2018-02-03 04:58:43 Would recommend looking some of these #Marijuanastocks simply due to the fact that most of them are so early in the game that they are trading like Penny Stocks. Because of the news that comes after elections and state voting on #marijuana , some companies rise quick. #EntreDupe

3565 2018-02-03 04:57:24 do drop  on the  USA  stock market   hope mal has lots of usa stocks
3566 2018-02-03 04:57:16 Stocks—oh wait
3567 2018-02-03 04:56:36 yes, it will be once. I don't have to sell stocks time and again due to overvaluation and falana
3568 2018-02-03 04:55:28 Rightly said sir........suggestions on some stocks to invest??
3569 2018-02-03 04:55:03 Who did you lose stocks to and in how many games did you lose a stock? I never kept count.
3570 2018-02-03 04:54:36 @KKolanovic 
Idyosyncratic stock specific catalysts cannot suppress stock correlation this earning season as great earnings are largely being ignored with most stocks getting slammed regardless of performance. Ex. refiners (VLO, MPC, ANDV) despite good crack spreads & EPS
3571 2018-02-03 04:54:26 I’d rather be a “self sufficient” trader. So, watched TIM FUNDAMENTALS yet again, to find My own stocks to play. Sadly, inadequate internet prevents me from using STT yet. Need to go “Old School”. Thanks @timothysykes for the lessons.
3572 2018-02-03 04:54:17 “Rich kids, watch their parents invest in stocks.  Poor kids watch their parent buy lotto tickets...”
3573 2018-02-03 04:53:41 I prefer investing in real estate and stocks but that is my own recipe for success.
3574 2018-02-03 04:53:40 My stocks are depressing me today
3575 2018-02-03 04:53:34 everyone: tryna book summer stocks

3576 2018-02-03 04:53:27 Instead #investors are trying to get rich off these securities, but these industries will be here for the long-term and only certain companies will be able to lead, those are the right investments. #EntreDupe #Entrepreneur #Cryptocurrencies #Marijuanastocks #stocks #wealthmaker
3577 2018-02-03 04:53:06 Right??? Doesn't apply to me, but I agree. Who would've thought that folks would be buying VIX stocks in the middle of FIRST QUARTER earnings season!
3578 2018-02-03 04:52:42 Everyday I used to get so many messages that our stocks will hit annual bse limit in Feb itself...so what  will we do till September??

Thankfully that conversation has gone out of the window 
3579 2018-02-03 04:52:08 Momentum has broken in small- and mid-cap stocks.  Only sophisticated investors can shift b/w bonds and stocks with perfection.
3580 2018-02-03 04:51:25 There are bad investors in real estate and bad investors in the market. A good investor knows that the market moves in cycles and plans for the long term. Good investors in stocks over the long term will be in great shape 20-30 years out.
3581 2018-02-03 04:50:31 Sir with due respect there are many a Times stocks did south bound post budget presentation - can we say those moments as referendum on your govt.
3582 2018-02-03 04:49:37 Please re-tweet when Hussman & zero hedge start doing victory laps, Ill know when to go all in High Beta stocks
3583 2018-02-03 04:49:19 Real estate investing is a fine way to go and investing in stocks is also a fine way to go. The key is investing and being smart about it, and also depends on what works for each person. Lots of money can be made in only the markets an extreme example of that is Warren Buffett
3584 2018-02-03 04:48:11 Can't buy stocks on credit either..  ..
3585 2018-02-03 04:47:49 looks like mj stocks before they crashed this week.
3586 2018-02-03 04:47:34 No different than stocks, minus the volatility and lack of regulation. It’s back to where it was pre-mainstream hype. All of the people who don’t understand it have scared off and sold

3588 2018-02-03 04:46:03 Oh wow. I had no idea. I mean why? And why are bump stocks still for sale? Common sense people. Jesus. I don't want your guns, own one myself, but when does this insanity stop?
3589 2018-02-03 04:45:23 Monday is going to be a great day to buy stocks.
3590 2018-02-03 04:44:15 HODL. Holding your wrecked position as a long term investment. In the stock market, People hold stocks for a long term investment because stock intrinsic price can be evaluated based on Price, Earnings, Debt, Inflation rate, etc.
3591 2018-02-03 04:43:31 Panic, the enemy of smart investors. As corrections come relax, look for stocks with good earnings, sells at a low Price to Earnings or P/E and buy. Bought Valero Energy VLO at $7, sold at $30, for a 300% + gain. How much left not holding long? $60+, Lesson? Learn about Stop Loss
3592 2018-02-03 04:42:53 Currently am not short in either of these stocks,  it's a learning process I am going thru and at top is discipline and var
3593 2018-02-03 04:42:19 Just a couple of days ago I told people that they needed to sell their stocks because they were being kept artificially high.  Huh!  I got that one right!  
3594 2018-02-03 04:41:37 When stocks go down and volatility goes up...write puts!
3595 2018-02-03 04:40:29 @GregMannarino stocks, bonds, gold etc all sell off big. Where will all that cash go? Gold safe haven?

@YahooFinance STOCKS should collapse!
3600 2018-02-03 04:38:47 Trump administration is money making machine, they will steal where they can and all bail out before stocks crash.  Nepotism is no concern, they broke that rule long ago.
3601 2018-02-03 04:37:40 Usually happens when Feds raise interest rates. Stocks bought on leverage r sold to pay higher interest rates
3602 2018-02-03 04:37:37 You have to wonder about this flu season- I know the cdc can’t identify all strains, but when you’ve got the head honcho buying and selling tobacco stocks, well, I gets this is what we get.
3603 2018-02-03 04:36:33 As the economy improves and stocks climb, traditional wisdom among fund managers and personal investors is to balance their portfolios with bonds, which because they are in a way both fiat, causes a delicate balance that can easily be tipped and cause a panic.
3604 2018-02-03 04:36:25 @deepakshenoy @TIA_Investors 

Diversified portfolio of 30 stocks helps you to overcome massive falls in case stock falls

3608 2018-02-03 04:33:37 Yes provided you are in the right stocks these corrections provide opportunity to add.
3609 2018-02-03 04:33:02 That's a liberal democrat number. They sold off stocks in an attempt to tank the market.
3610 2018-02-03 04:32:42 4 months ago 59 people were slaughtered in Las Vegas. The GOP controls congress and the White House. After saying they would look into bump stocks, nothing has been done. Nothing will be done.
3611 2018-02-03 04:32:04 Here I thought that would be better directed at game journalists who keep trying to sell the same line of bullshit and end up laughing stocks.
3612 2018-02-03 04:31:14 Yeah... dems liberals & minions are going to rue the day they all sold off their stocks in an attempt to tank the market. But the rest of us loveLoveLOVE ya for it.

Deal 2 sell stocks & buy NPs. @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @AP @CBS @nbc @ABC @Trevornoah @JonStewartRocks @AFGENational
3615 2018-02-03 04:29:22 Clearly, Sarah, it is 4 u.  When profits of companies drop so do dividends & stocks.  Profits go down when companies hire & wages go up.  When companies layoff & eliminate jobs, profits/income go up as do dividends & stocks.  Yeah, it's true. Taxes, hiring, wages are complicated.
3616 2018-02-03 04:29:03 Uh...I believe they have been busy fitting their weaponry WITH bump stocks. Hell, they have been equipping themselves with bazookas! The NRA probably has access to "special implements" that may be useful.
3617 2018-02-03 04:28:56 The 666 point drop in #stocks is so 2018. The universe knows we are in the wrong time stream, and it's sending out SOS signals. Peter Capaldi is going to show up in a blue box, do a thing, and voila.
3618 2018-02-03 04:28:40 Labor force participation rate still at its lowest level in many many years, lowest job creation since 2010. Average earnings up because of govt imposed minimum wage increases. Gallup poll says only 52% of Americans own stocks. Q4 GDP growth 2.6%.
3619 2018-02-03 04:26:49 Go thru the black Hole, Just pass right thru the black hole.. god this market took a major shit today, buy some AT THE MONEY Money Puts  Buy Insurance for your stocks Please. they are called Puts.

3623 2018-02-03 04:25:14 Any blurts and wallowing in the latest falls seen on Wall Street ? - huge bigly selling off, massive sad drops in stocks !! Win !
3624 2018-02-03 04:25:04 Yes because 53 percent of Americans own no stocks, including in their retirement accounts.
3625 2018-02-03 04:25:04 That only affects you if you have stock in one of the Dow industrial average stocks; and they’re still down today. Half empty or half full?

3627 2018-02-03 04:23:51 If you invest in stocks. I highly suggest investing in Sketchers. It's about to erupt. SKX
3628 2018-02-03 04:23:48 And many more have banked the money and enacted layoffs... and stocks are falling —-  trickle down means just that
3629 2018-02-03 04:23:39 Learnt this in 2008. Yesterday my folio of 15 stocks was down only 1.25%. hopefully better days ahead.
3630 2018-02-03 04:23:16 How far did stocks drop? No mention of that. Huge jump in black unemployment? No mention of that.
3631 2018-02-03 04:22:57 LTCG tax on stocks was scrapped in 2004-05 by then finance minister P Chidambaram.
3632 2018-02-03 04:22:53 Yea. I’m just passing on what the financial experts were saying. Just added 200,000 jobs to the market. I’m working full time for first time in 4 years. I don’t own stocks but i surely feel bad for those Wall Street fellas who lost all that $ today!
3633 2018-02-03 04:22:38 History class is why I didn’t buy cannabis of bitcoin stocks when the media was all over it. #tulips
3634 2018-02-03 04:21:50 Doesn't help what used to be the middle class nor the disabled who don't own stocks or bonds or food to last the month.. economic growth means nothing to them. Help the poor Mr. President

3636 2018-02-03 04:21:25 Exactly. When enough cash in prices drop as the stocks supply overcomes it's demand. It's going to be bad for us too but damnit I'm of a mind it has to happen if its all connected like that. We cannot bear this regime.
3637 2018-02-03 04:20:31 Whahaha hindi. Yung sa stocks ph lang tsaka investagrams. Virtual trading.
3638 2018-02-03 04:20:20 Might want to remind these players how it was in 1994-1997 in empty stadiums
3639 2018-02-03 04:20:06 Yes, it's not bcoz of LTCG and this is why it's fearing more to me. I wold be glad if it was bcoz of LTCG bcoz it could have stayed maximum for a week or two. But to buy stocks, seems an early call.
3640 2018-02-03 04:19:35 I've realized my short term goal on investing. Earn enough to invest in dividend stocks and short term trading. Constructive input accepted. @themotleyfool @MarketWatch
3641 2018-02-03 04:18:44 Will the LTCG tax be calculated on the basis of individual stocks or on the basis of whole investment adding all stocks of different company's.
3642 2018-02-03 04:18:39 Which would you rather learn?

3646 2018-02-03 04:17:25 This is the set up.  Obamas billionaires had the plan in place. if you stuck with your tax cuts. Facebook had 10 billionaires lecture us on getting gold, stocks, anything but cash because they are going to introduce a new money. The dollar will be devalued.
3647 2018-02-03 04:17:18 Are weed stocks getting crushed for the same reason? Winter Bear. Tax season. Same shit every year. Come back in June.

3651 2018-02-03 04:15:56 That’s why they are called investors- bcoz they hold on to stocks for LONG TERM.  What LTCG does is create hassle for retail long term investor, who doesn’t trust MFs& also has not enough time to watch markets. FM Telling everybody to bcm traders.

3655 2018-02-03 04:13:14 @FuzzyPandaShort No offense, but your "talent" as an analyst becomes very apparent when looking at the performance of other stocks you bashed.
There are quite a few stocks where people would have gone bankrupt if they followed your advice and shorted.
3656 2018-02-03 04:13:11 Because stocks are controlled by suits sn speculators in house. Crypto is out of there reach an not having control scares them into attempting killing it
3657 2018-02-03 04:13:07 This bill to ban the pump stocks was voted down in Va. last week. Want to know why??  The damn Republicans.  So any deaths that occur from the pump stock are directly because of Republican voters. PERIOD!  PERIOD!!!!  PERIOD!!!!!
3658 2018-02-03 04:13:02 My FBI agent probably learned how to trade stocks through my laptop and most likely quit their job 
3659 2018-02-03 04:13:01 so true. they won’t talk about the fact that even bonds, usually a good bet when stocks are down, also had a major sell off. but let’s talk about the demise of digital currency, which is just vapor, lol.
3660 2018-02-03 04:12:17 As the NYT coverage says, stocks fell because wages are finally rising. Gross.
3661 2018-02-03 04:11:31 Imagine missing a train

3666 2018-02-03 04:09:15 Why you don’t say anything about stocks market was down, did you do anything so stocks market went down and lots of people lost money.
3667 2018-02-03 04:08:34 Came home from work & my 10 yr old has a competition in his gifted class. His group has 100K to invest in stocks from now until end of April.  Was thinking leveraged ETF’s but open to suggestions on how to help him knock it out of the park.
3668 2018-02-03 04:08:29 You may want to invest in stocks... soap on a rope is going to be a big seller
3669 2018-02-03 04:07:45 Uh, my "stocks" are still up about 5% for 2018 so...not sure there's anything to complain about....
3670 2018-02-03 04:07:30 Not a bid deal, looks big but really only 2.5%. Interest on bonds jumped and too much money pouring into stocks. Pro basically took some profits. Expect to get back on track.
3671 2018-02-03 04:07:24 Stock market down today proves real estate only safe investment. 

You can’t live in your stocks. 
You can’t get a tenant in the basement suite. 
You can’t put in new hardwood floors and granite countertops so what is even the point
3672 2018-02-03 04:06:22 Can’t he just buy pot stocks ? 
3673 2018-02-03 04:06:10 News: Stocks fell 600 points today!

3674 2018-02-03 04:06:08 Crypto correction was coming, I sent much ETH off to new ICOs and took initial positions out. Took a lil fiat for travel and camera equipment a few weeks ago. @sxsw = crypto & blockchain circus. Millenials don’t buy stocks. Propaganda war just starting  #crypto #blockchain
3675 2018-02-03 04:06:06 Now Raghul Gandhi has a great chance to say Dow Jones (US) stocks crashed because of Indian budget!!!!!!!!
3676 2018-02-03 04:04:20 "There's no such thing as a free lunch" unless the Fed is buying. And in Japan it's even more blatant. The BOJ actually buys stocks! stocks!!
3677 2018-02-03 04:03:52 Bitcoin is down but so are Marijuana stocks. Weak hands can't handle the smoke either it seems.

3678 2018-02-03 04:03:22 To take my mind off work stress, I decided to read the news. Wrong move! No worries, though. To take my mind off the news stress, I'm just gonna check on my stocks.
3679 2018-02-03 04:03:15 Jobs, stocks and GDP are rising under Trump, just as they did under Obama. In fact, by almost every measure, the performance of the economy under Trump is indistinguishable from Obama’s second term...

3681 2018-02-03 04:01:57 Those and bump stocks ... perfect... Why do citizens need armor piecing bullets for self protection or sports hunting? How disgusting does this need to get?
3682 2018-02-03 03:59:31 Stocks drop by Satan's revenge, 666 points.  Following the memo fail and growing recognition that inflation is starting to pick up ... including weakening US$ on the world market.

3684 2018-02-03 03:58:14 Mistakes are bound to happen, but well played even being short into this week. I kept trying to fight it all week and got beat up as a result. Told a friend of mine now isn’t the time to move her money into funds containing stocks. Thinking cont. weakness.
3685 2018-02-03 03:57:32 Along with purchasing stocks, bonds, ect.. This really isn’t a big deal considering all investments are not available usually with a CC!  lol

3689 2018-02-03 03:56:14 Well.. similarly you can’t by bonds, stocks, or other investments with a CC.. not sure what the fuss is here..
3690 2018-02-03 03:54:11 I’m not a ‘pro’ but the market will be fine, regulation is being brought up at the G20 summit soon. Yes treat it like stocks tax-wise. Government employees should not be allowed to invest. Too much insider knowledge on “announcements”
3691 2018-02-03 03:54:01 Hey Hannity. Did you notice how well the stock market did today? Why hasn’t trump said something about a 666 point drop the biggest drop in stocks in 2 years!

3696 2018-02-03 03:51:02 Stocks don;t just go straight up in the air every day yuh know. I am up almost 50 frikin percent still. 50%+
3697 2018-02-03 03:50:45 In 3 days stocks are down by 30%, as Hub Town  is 100, GMR , PCJ and others, it took a year for them to be there and ....
3698 2018-02-03 03:50:03 Y’all are more concerned about banning bump stocks than y’all are about getting to the truth of what happened in Vegas that night. 

We still know very little about that night. It’s borderline conspiratorial.
3699 2018-02-03 03:49:49 The Stock Market is a decent proxy for the economy of the 54% of Americans who own stocks. So about half of us, the wealthier half. 

The rest of us don't care, unless it affects #Mortgage or personal loan rates.
3700 2018-02-03 03:49:30 Also what happens, is that investors who have stocks/bonds in that market, might be switching their stocks and bonds around based on what benefits them. THIS is the time where they buy low, so they can make a profit after the stocks go up again.
3701 2018-02-03 03:48:41 You're right. The tax break raised the deficit, surged the economy & will force the Feds to raise interest rates which leads to movement from stocks to bonds. @realDonaldTrump took credit for Dow Jones increase. He will own it's decline.
3702 2018-02-03 03:47:04 Even if any those 3 agencies their stocks will go down but still they won’t be push out/remove from BIG 3.
3703 2018-02-03 03:46:42 Why do you feel so sir? Is there that level of price manipulation in some stocks? Really sad!
3704 2018-02-03 03:46:32 Just another night of sending Pygmy goat videos to @EmilyPiver while she’s away from me at NC State

3707 2018-02-03 03:45:46 Stocks take a tremendous dive!!!! Thanks to Treason and lies!!   The Trump syndrome
3708 2018-02-03 03:45:43 Devin Nuna Nuna was a nothing and stocks were down because the elites are worried the rabble is making too much money
3709 2018-02-03 03:45:36 Ummm stock market dropped 666 points a couple hours after he released the memo. Interesting exactly 666 sign of the devil.  So the stocks are not happy. #TrumpsFAKEMemo #markets #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #TrumpRepublicanObstruction
3710 2018-02-03 03:45:27 It's not abt the market's direction, I'm talking abt those who have been trying to make illegitimate gains through some stocks- taking undue advantage of the #bull market

3713 2018-02-03 03:42:40 @BankofAmerica fairly uneducated move banning crypto purchases with credit... Some accounts give you access to these purchases quicker. Are you doing the same with stocks? #gladidontbankwithyou
3714 2018-02-03 03:42:23 Stocks fell today.
3715 2018-02-03 03:41:58 Number of leading stocks today: 30 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
3716 2018-02-03 03:41:28 One good thing is that the good stocks that pay dividends will continue to pay those dividends. In this case it does not matter if the stock falls in value. Over time those values will return. $mmi
3717 2018-02-03 03:40:30 It was expected to correct at some time. I guess now is the time. It will likely continue into next week. 
Good stocks are getting hurt too but the bad ones are getting slaughtered.
3718 2018-02-03 03:40:16 I saw this 2 weeks back. Devastated with the fees. There are no separate gold mines for finding multi baggers.
Some stocks from your portfolio itself may become multi baggers if you hold for long term.
3719 2018-02-03 03:40:12 All picks are quality stocks but selling and buying in panic market should be avoidable for retail investor

3722 2018-02-03 03:38:28 No! He only takes credit when the stocks were rising. This Dow drop is all Obama’s fault.
3723 2018-02-03 03:38:24 I was lucky enough to pull out last week. Bought $CANN yesterday and today. Will add other stocks next week as I’m hoping market to go down next week further.

3727 2018-02-03 03:37:13 I'm an int'l ahgase, but if I were in SoKor I would also get frustrated if I wouldn't get any merch or goods. They should've more stocks. I'm frustrated in behalf of them
3728 2018-02-03 03:36:28 If you are talking about stocks I will book my profit and wait for the right price to buy
3729 2018-02-03 03:35:58 The rational that bull markets end when rates rise is opportunist fiction..

From 2003 -2007, the S&P doubled as rates rose from 1% to 6.5%..

This is a simple retracement after a buying capitulation...

3738 2018-02-03 03:26:51 Randy would love everything except the lack of AR-15s and 50 caliber anti-aircraft guns being available to the general public. Come on, dude. At least you can support a ban on bump stocks.
3739 2018-02-03 03:26:45 6oo pts. down stocks today; I think the genie is out of the bottle. Doesn't sound like a rousing endorsement, King of Krap!! Get a job, please, elsewhere.  Stop misinforming the President.  You know he doesn't read or get long briefings because he is watching the FAUX Buffoonery.

3746 2018-02-03 03:23:00 Ironically my husband pulled our money out of stocks last week to move to another vehicle. It was just sitting cash in the bank through all this!

3752 2018-02-03 03:18:21 Weapons in hotel room appeared to be on stands, so bump stocks won't/don't work. Much about LasVegas isn't public. Bump stocks aren't the problem. A lack of respect for life is the issue. Re Texas, domestic dispute; wouldn't have had weapons if military had filed the paperwork.
3753 2018-02-03 03:18:19 think 
market fell today bc interest rates are going to rise good job report (TY obama)
long end may rise to 3% where you dump stocks and buy debt (no RISK)
So, rates rise, GOVT debt payments rise, money guys dump stocks w lower tax -cut-rates 
debt screams higher
"recession"

3759 2018-02-03 03:17:21 666 is is how much the stocks fell today Trump taking credit for that one maybe it's a sign his the Antichrist
3760 2018-02-03 03:16:34 But saying stocks are up only really benefits people in the stock market majority of t/country are not in, temporarily, they'll go back up past the levels they were at in 5 years, they're giving out $1K when they're saving multi-millions, that's crumbs.
Saving planet is nothing?
3761 2018-02-03 03:16:17 I’m in there as well 
3762 2018-02-03 03:16:11 Yeah. The Fed is curbing the overheated economy through interest rates. Thus, stocks drop. It’s necessary.
3763 2018-02-03 03:16:02 The Dow Jones industrial average PLUNGED 2.5 percent Friday, closing down 666 points - suffered its WORST WEEK in 2 years. WORST DAY for stocks since U took office. The market has been on a historic nine-year bull run. Are you going to take credit for this or blame Obama?

3767 2018-02-03 03:13:38 Pointing to select inflated upside down RE markets to generalize owning does not make sense is like cherry picking a portfolio of PE 80 stocks to “prove” equities are a bad investment.
3768 2018-02-03 03:12:56 Did @BJP4India @arunjaitley @narendramodi play the same game 2 make Money out of Stock Market 4 Funds of upcoming Elections in 2018-19 lyk @PChidambaram_IN used 2 do in UPA terms. SHORT Market/Stocks n say a Negative News later so that Market crashes n they make Money @Swamy39 ??
3769 2018-02-03 03:12:29 And all that buying was sold into yday !! By certain forces - 1 year ahead of election to prove that the final budget of this govt was bad !! This is more politics than anything else !! This has anyway given us a chance to pick stocks like PC Jew / hind copper / TAta mo / ashley
3770 2018-02-03 03:10:57 Hey, idiots!  Stock prices do not reflect economic performance!  When stock prices rise, only those who own stocks benefit.  This is an illusion of wealth and not a measure of benefit to the middle and lower classes.
3771 2018-02-03 03:10:56 Awww, c'mon now!  Stocks have been going up for years with no correction.  Past time it corrected itself!  Trump is supposed to be so smart with money he should know this! He just spews things that he thinks makes him look good!
3772 2018-02-03 03:10:51 Crypto and stocks on sale!  lol
3773 2018-02-03 03:10:44 For the economic illiterate (the Dems who Obama “relied on your stupidity”)... it’s because of the GREAT jobs report today - as economy does better, interests rates will rise.. reason for some sell-off of stocks today. Perfectly normal economic flow

3776 2018-02-03 03:08:46 @ArlanFF101 Bond mkt action has some calling for a burst bubble in bonds and stocks. In that event would any $ shift to commodity markets, or would it be a late-2008-like market for equities and commodities?

3788 2018-02-03 03:02:00 If only we could go back about 250 years...I'd love to see Comey, Clinton, Yates, Mueller, Pelosi, Clapper, Brennan, Lynch, Rosenstein, Warner, Schiff all in stocks. I'd love to bounce some tomatoes and eggs off of them.
3789 2018-02-03 03:01:59 Stocks took a beating today. Debt ceiling crisis looming quicker. All this winning.
3790 2018-02-03 03:01:17 While the markets had a run up, I had marked a few select stocks which I would like to re-enter at certain lower level. Those stocks have come down to those levels yesterday. So, If you believe in your study, do what you need to do, irrespective of what market does. #opportunity
3791 2018-02-03 03:01:08 I was really tempted to answer DJT since he wants to take credit when things are good. But, I have to be consistent in my argument that POTUS has little direct effect on stocks.
3792 2018-02-03 03:00:33 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Dow stocks crashed today (666). You been tweeting when it goes up, but it’s down and you are silent! #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia
3793 2018-02-03 03:00:17 You losers lost your last thread of credibility today. Why aren’t you talking about the stock Market?  Blaming the Democrats is old time for a new script Sarah. Pathetic laughing stocks
3794 2018-02-03 03:00:09 Thanks For The Stocks Schlumberger 
3795 2018-02-03 02:59:59 Today I finally found where my local Target stocks the geeky stuff for growns. Not knowing probably saved me a lot over the years.
3796 2018-02-03 02:59:55 Some good midcap stocks.

3798 2018-02-03 02:58:05 I probably wound up on your feed because you were buying one of the stocks I was shorting.. and how did that work out for you? Or, maybe you shorted too. In which case we’re on the same page and you can’t talk shit.
3799 2018-02-03 02:57:42 Pun'kin let me help you. Get your money out of the market now, first bonds then stocks Problem is the dollar is weak now We're in a "Trump HappyTime" bubble The residual momentum of the Obama fiscal policies are running out & DT has no foundation Inflation's right around the bend

3806 2018-02-03 02:51:28 Newest stock lesson I learned, have cash available to buy stocks on the downturn.    Not that I have any.  lol  But good lesson nonetheless!

@AlderLaneeggs The purchase of stock by the CEO has significant predictive power especially in small cap stocks. I also noticed a 13-g today by Mrs. B I believe

3811 2018-02-03 02:48:47 Ppl tend to forget that equity's basic idea is investment, not day trading as business. Ppl want to earn a livelyhood out of day trading and keep failing. FNO is a weapon of mass destruction.

Do not trade in FNO, rather invest whatever small amounts you can into quality stocks.

3814 2018-02-03 02:48:09 The irony of this statement #bitcoin 

"Those rising rates are making it harder to say there is no alternative to stocks," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said this week that both stocks and bonds are in a "bubble."
3815 2018-02-03 02:48:06 With cryptos and stocks all taking a dive today, my only question is: Who is cashing all this out and where is the money going?
3816 2018-02-03 02:48:02 @AndrewLSeidel stocks drop 666 points. Satan trying to tell Orange putz something?

3819 2018-02-03 02:46:44 Can any one advise the blood bath in stocks will be further in coming week or stabilized?
3820 2018-02-03 02:46:32 Stocks are part of economy.  Tax cuts that are already showing up on peoples paychecks, bonuses that unless you are pelosi are not crumbs, Climate accord was financially unbalanced and doing nothing. Brink of nuclear war was brought on by past presidents ignoring
3821 2018-02-03 02:46:05 @realDonaldTrump is a business man. He knows how this works. He's probably sold his important stocks over the past few weeks.

#StockMarket 666 the anti christ did it.
3822 2018-02-03 02:45:45 Why did the Wall Street plunge today? 
- Maybe the investor class realized that crazy orange in the White House gonna blow all their schemes after all, so they better take their confidence (read Money) & park them somewhere else, like in Cayman Island or Bermuda.

3823 2018-02-03 02:45:22 As stocks sell off the long-overdue next major bear, #Gold investment demand will make a comeback. Investors will flock back 2 gold to stabilize their bleeding stock-heavy portfolios, taking price much higher. Likely take years of buying 2 restore overall portfolio allocations.

3825 2018-02-03 02:43:25 @SpeakerRyan you and the @GOP and @FoxNews will not fool the American people any longer.  Even the hard core wing are dumping their stocks.  You can’t save yourself, but do something for your country.  Come clean. Stop the coverup.

3827 2018-02-03 02:42:30 True... But the current times are slightly tricky. I was watching two stocks yesterday... One was PC jewelry and other Cummins. While one of them was hit by a bad news, and going down was expected. Cummins for no reason or news was going down 12%.
3828 2018-02-03 02:40:51 @realDonaldTrump @RepDevinNunes @foxnewspolitics @washingtonpost @nytpolitics @MSNBC @maddow Trump and Nunes became laughing stocks.  Trump is an inept doofus and Nunes is the Kings Babbler.
3829 2018-02-03 02:40:37 Middle class had just started to shed their inhabitations about investing in stocks and MF's. With imposition of LTCG govt has set back stock markets by decade or more.
3830 2018-02-03 02:39:47 Stocks are not the economy, he's riding an healthy economy and an unemployment improvement trend that Obama started, getting rid of ind mandate and out of climate accord and TPP are not positives, brink of nuclear war w/NK is a good thing?
And he lies almost daily
3831 2018-02-03 02:37:54 LOL, a year of record gains, and then the rats come out of the woodwork about stocks. Reminds me of the climate change fiasco. Not a word no hurricanes entire year to hit the land, but then come out of the woodwork when some record is broken.  U guys are full of broken records.
3832 2018-02-03 02:37:37 It's Trump's stock market now.  That said, 27.6% gain on S&P500 index since Trump's election ain't too shabby.  May even be a buying opportunity.  Bubbles happen.  Fed policy sending % rates higher in sync with expectations for economic growth. Higher % rates not good for stocks.
3833 2018-02-03 02:36:29 No place to hide as bond yields spike hurt US stocks & LTCG becomes an excuse for much needed time/price correction in India
3834 2018-02-03 02:35:54 Par wo stock to uppar tha!! ;-)
Wid indian news channel logic all d stocks listed in d pic should fall like PCJ? Haha
3835 2018-02-03 02:35:47 ICYMI @realDonaldTrump stocks fell 666 points today.
3836 2018-02-03 02:33:43 Guess its how one is positioned in the #market, for years some have said #gold is a useless #investment but notice how they never drop the price and let us have it dirt cheap if its so useless, lol, as far as #crypto, still watching for a confirmation same with certain #stocks
3837 2018-02-03 02:32:40 Stocks down today 666 points, pretty epic sign?
3838 2018-02-03 02:32:28 It’s technically inflation related, but the effect is the same - STOCKS DO WELL WHEN WORKERS DON’T
3839 2018-02-03 02:31:57 The stock market is CRAP right now.... save yourself the grief and Don’t check your stocks
3840 2018-02-03 02:30:01 Memo was so transparent, it caused a DEM stampede to #GoldmanSachs to cash in their #NYSE stocks and bonds in hope to buy Washington’s best attorneys. #YoMemoJokes

3847 2018-02-03 02:24:18 Shit. I own stocks. I can't laugh at people losing stock money. I will lose a whole... *check receipts* ...nvm I can still laugh
3848 2018-02-03 02:23:40  RT @muhfugginjkells: Fuck Bit Coin, im investing in gun stocks. Every time we have a mass shooting, gun sales skyrocket. And we good for at least 7 of those a year now.
3849 2018-02-03 02:23:19 I may have lost 2k in stocks today... but I submit that you all buy @pepsi, @CocaCola and #USTobacco , bc in my new job I'll be living on diet  @MountainDew , @CokeZero and copenhagen
3850 2018-02-03 02:23:18 Not so much a specific stock, although something like poor earnings or legals action can affect price. But most stocks are part of mutual funds. So it's usually groups of stocks that affect overall market change. And most of it is automatically triggered by computer programs. 1/

3852 2018-02-03 02:23:10 My account at EPC from 2008 until July 2016 did nothing but lose money while US stocks doubled. Schiff is a broken clock who has no idea how to invest.
3853 2018-02-03 02:23:07 I'm so fucking screwed. I was in debt to begin with, but now the tax burden from pulling my stocks for last summer is going to absolutely destroy me.
3854 2018-02-03 02:20:58 Given recent news of the  disappearance of world cheese stocks. I should probably invest

3860 2018-02-03 02:18:07 Sorry to throw cold water on the link between Revelation 13:18 and today's drop in the stock market, but 666 in the book has nothing to do with stocks or bonds or presidents. It's a reference to the evils of the Roman Empire, which were a very present concern in John's day.
3861 2018-02-03 02:18:00 RT @SenFeinstein: 4 months ago today marked the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with 59 people slaughtered. We’re still pushing our bill to ban bump stocks, which allowed a semi-automatic weapon to fire like a machine gun. It’s time for Republicans to get on board.

3864 2018-02-03 02:17:08 Some sort of pullback/correction was needed, maybe it's starting. Calling bottom will be impossible though. Will definitely get some good deals on the dividend stocks that go down for the ride, too.
3865 2018-02-03 02:16:01 btw if you haven't check the news, funny is stock market just dipped all time low from 2 years , deleting 500 billions in friday , 1 trillion last week. So apparently we are in sell-off , cheap coins/stocks february on all fronts :) :D . I bet crypto will recover faster than stoc
3866 2018-02-03 02:15:59 Yeah, but uh, if you own lots of stocks, bully for you. Even if the Dow diminishes significantly, YOU can still afford health care, a roof over your head, and to spend a little of your disposable income on protecting our nation from the right wing, low-info, scamming low life.
3867 2018-02-03 02:15:39 Yes according to experts: power of compounding, equity creates wealth in Long Term only. Best time to buy 60-70% discounted stocks.... 
3868 2018-02-03 02:15:29 With stocks man, when you see buy volume go up to peak quickly n then it dumps you see huge volume you know it's dead/ dying n bearish. You don't see that on the chart I sent n that's what I'm pointing out.
3869 2018-02-03 02:14:50 So, the overall value of share price of Dow stocks went down, what makes a specific stock fall? What happens, supply greater than demand? Thank you by the way.

3876 2018-02-03 02:12:17 Also putting money into stocks, real estate, domains etc. - crypto is a small investment for me, I'm a big believer in diversification so I also hope Apple, Amazon, NVidia and others kick ass and take names over the next five years too! :)

3879 2018-02-03 02:10:31 Wow! Stocks took a nose dive today.  What did you do to cause that?
3880 2018-02-03 02:09:44 I can't wait for stocks to be cheap again
3881 2018-02-03 02:09:27 lol only want to talk about Vegas when it’s convenient.. where’s the coroners report? Where’s the second suspect? Where’s Campos? Why did MGM owner sell off stocks prior? Why did George Soros place put?
3882 2018-02-03 02:09:08 Some market insiders say stocks are due for a nasty fall, maybe this is your time to get back in.
3883 2018-02-03 02:08:14 Can someone explain why my dad texted me asking for stock market advice when my knowledge on stocks is a hard zero ???????
3884 2018-02-03 02:08:10 How's all your stocks doing ?
Making laws to help them lately ?
3885 2018-02-03 02:07:34 Has to do with fears re inflation and possibility of higher interest rates. Rates go up, bonds look like better investment, money moves out of stocks into bond market. Stock market goes down.
Truth be told, the stock market is a lousy measurev of the overall economy.
3886 2018-02-03 02:07:28 My stocks and 401k got murdered today. Thanks @DevinNunes and @GOP!

3888 2018-02-03 02:05:48 Now THIS IS GREAT! The DOW closed DOWN _666_ POINTS today! APROPOS! Your rich but meagre base/donors aren't going to like that tho. Soon they'll be asking 4 your ARREST as stocks plummet.Depending on IC's redeeming Royal Flush,& your rushed imprisonment, things could look up.

3893 2018-02-03 02:02:27 Wonders why the number 666 comes up way to often in the WH admin.  Stocks fell 666 points today.  And I'm not religious.  Can someone please tackle Trump or Kusner and look for that number on their scalp.

3897 2018-02-03 02:01:33 I put 10% of every paycheck in savings immediately. Then I invest every $100 into some sort of asset such as stocks, bonds, business startups.
3898 2018-02-03 02:01:29 Have u ever had a class in economics?  If u haven’t u need one. Interest rates are rising due to a much better economy. This puts upward pressure on interest rates. Cheap money is going away so margin buying costs more to those buying stocks.  Get a clue!
3899 2018-02-03 02:01:20 Time to start shorting stocks.

3900 2018-02-03 02:00:54 FUN FACT:  Under Trump's administration, the Stocks Market at   666 POINTS  — largest point decline since 2008 financial crisis. 

Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner's precious building number is 666
3901 2018-02-03 02:00:25 What does it mean that stocks nose dive on news that American workers finally are beginning to see their wages rise after years of stagnation?
3902 2018-02-03 01:59:55 Stocks going up stocks going down he is a fuckhead either way.
3903 2018-02-03 01:59:37 Roy, how'd ur stocks do today? BTW you haven't said anything about the release of the memo (cause of the drop in stock mkt) so I figured you haven't heard yet. Pease comment. Other Rs are commenting. Are you seriously going to not comment on anything until ur campaigning in 2022?
3904 2018-02-03 01:58:58 If an article about rising wages caused stocks to tumble today then we’re not measuring the economy in any way that’s relevant to 99% of Americans.
3905 2018-02-03 01:58:53 8th largest drop in stocks in history...
3906 2018-02-03 01:57:35 What if this was Wall Street pumping and dumping alts to reck the price of $BTC, so they can turn around and immediately diversify out of stocks and into #Bitcoin, funny how the crypto crash just aligned itself with Dow 666  point crash #MarkoftheBeast
3907 2018-02-03 01:56:42 Stocks fell about 667 points but LEAVE IT STILL ABOVE 25000. So stop comparing that to 2 years ago.  Use your brain and learn how to THINK!

3916 2018-02-03 01:53:42 That most people don't have stocks. That the stock market value, whatever that means, it's all paper, doesn't mean anything to most Americans. That he added over a trillion to the debt. That major service cuts are coming now. Etc. Etc.

3924 2018-02-03 01:50:25 There are no regulations over who can buy penny stocks, for instance. They can be just as wild as BTC and be outright fraud. Nor are there regulations over how often you can trade, buying high and selling low.
3925 2018-02-03 01:48:25 I've been anticipating a 5 to 7 percent correction for a few months, a bunch of tech stocks are ridiculously overpriced. Finger in the air prediction, market stabilizes in the mid 24K range

3931 2018-02-03 01:45:14 Will celebrate when the market goes back up again. The market always drops during tax season. People are selling stocks to pay for taxes.

3938 2018-02-03 01:43:00 Most people tweeting about the dow do not know about how stocks and bonds and interest rates work. If only they knew the markets fell today more than  likely due to the scare of potential interest hikes and currency value. All this means is the economy is stronger. #bondsday

3957 2018-02-03 01:38:19 Exactly!  If it were wages would rise with stocks and just the opposite happens historically wages FALL as stocks rise. Higher wages or a guaranteed national income will eventually be a requirement unless you intend to run a nation of robots with no humans which yields max prod.
3958 2018-02-03 01:38:03 They're great as long as you don't get advice on stocks or college classes!

3963 2018-02-03 01:35:20 my mom always stocks me up with toiletries whenever I go home and this the first time I’ve run out & now I gotta buy them with my own money 
3964 2018-02-03 01:35:16 Would... would that be bad for the stock market? I mean I can see smaller domestic flows into stocks, but also higher revenues for most consumer-facing companies...
3965 2018-02-03 01:34:48 Memo goat-fuckery caused the worst week since 1980. Do I have time to liquidate stocks before the next memo?
3966 2018-02-03 01:34:38 When some of the stocks in our portfolio fall, it's but natural to feel alarmed  or panic. However, it's not the end of the world yet  as we're just starting 2018. 
Holders consistently make money over time while traders have a far more mixed record. #hodl
3967 2018-02-03 01:34:07 All the other stocks you mention we're just part of the pull back today in the massive sell off but @newagefarminc specifically has been in a downtrend for as long as I can remember poor management for HR poor communication with shareholders.... Going No Where But bankrupt
3968 2018-02-03 01:33:32 Lets go short some stocks!
3969 2018-02-03 01:33:10 This coming from a millionaire? Oh so working people do not get wage increases yet your profits and stocks skyrocket !!! F/U 
3970 2018-02-03 01:33:10 The indicators are jobs and wage data is too hot so bank interest is up which forces stocks down.

3975 2018-02-03 01:30:47 Did you even read the article??? Obviously NOT... here read the first statement...
"U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a STRONGER-than-expected JOBS report sent interest rates higher."..

3978 2018-02-03 01:29:33 Majority of the Stocks in the Stock market are overvalued because companies are buying large portions of their own stock which increases the value of their stock /company. It's all being heavily manipulated and It's only a matter of time before it crashes.
3979 2018-02-03 01:28:56 Few Americans will see an increase in pay. The facts are that most companies are giving that windfall savings to their investors &/or using it to buy back stocks. That massive pay increase that Trump is claiming has already happened under him, it averages 4¢ an hour.
3980 2018-02-03 01:28:25 Or moved your portfolio to foreign stocks with limited US exposure shortly after Trump’s election.

My portfolio dropped 0.58% today.
3981 2018-02-03 01:28:04 It's okay to place greedy limit buys.  They fill when the market drops hard like this.  And when they hit? FeelsGoodMan

#markets #stocks #investing #cryptocurrency
3982 2018-02-03 01:28:03 Weird how stocks drop with just the tiniest rise in wages? Couldn't be that Wall Street profit from robbing workers could it?
3983 2018-02-03 01:27:10 The stock market dropped today because of a stronger than expected jobs report.  Explain to me again how the the market is a barometer for how the country is doing. #markets #stocks #economy #StockMarket #DowJones
3984 2018-02-03 01:26:06 I'm so diversified that I won't make the 15-20% gains like an all stocks portfolio, but I also won't lose 4% in a week either.

3994 2018-02-03 01:23:53 What has he done this year you think is that awful? Stocks are up, unemployment is down even for minorities, got rid of individual mandate, TPP, Paris Climate Accord, Going after IRAN, ISIS, N Korea, got our allies like Israel back and stopped kisding ISLAMs ass

3996 2018-02-03 01:22:41 None of the stocks I'm watching have dropped enough to interest me. #fistclenchedaroundmycash
3997 2018-02-03 01:22:26 No it didn't. The Stock Market always goes down for a little bit to correct any excessive Inflation/Deflation by increasing/decreasing Interest Rates. This did could also be Investors switching from stocks to bonds or visa versa. the Stock Market isn't in any danger. It'll be ok.
3998 2018-02-03 01:22:19 Not the day to dilly about stocks
3999 2018-02-03 01:22:15 Just making stocks cheaper so that more people can afford them.
4000 2018-02-03 01:21:17 Woo Hoo, Markets on sale!  I can't say what it will do next week, but stocks are cheaper than they were last week.
4001 2018-02-03 01:20:43 The DOW dropped 666 points today.  Since you took credit for the rise of stocks, you must be to blame for the fall of stocks.  Worst POTUS ever.
4002 2018-02-03 01:20:33 What are you getting into next Elon...bump stocks?
4003 2018-02-03 01:20:22 I got a raise and will be getting another in April! As well as aditional stocks! So excited
4004 2018-02-03 01:19:36 As I know it, law makers tried to ban bump stocks. Key word: tried.
4005 2018-02-03 01:19:12 "After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks." Acts 16:23-24
4006 2018-02-03 01:19:01 Time to make some money on the dropping stocks... 
4007 2018-02-03 01:18:46 I'm learning that it doesn't matter what the answer should be, it's what the answer is going to be the soonest. Stocks are fickle and people are easily manipulated one way or another. The real answer is to know they are being manipulated and get out of the way or join them. $AAPL
4008 2018-02-03 01:18:13 must say...... of so many stocks falling, NVDA mystifies me.
4009 2018-02-03 01:17:54 The health of our economy is NOT best measured by how stocks are doing, or how much wealth has accumulated at the top, but by how the people at the *bottom* end of the scale are surviving.  If they are struggling, *then we are failing* as a society.

4018 2018-02-03 01:15:25 BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
4019 2018-02-03 01:13:57 Stocks down?  Ok.  Jobs and wages were trending that way before trump.  You can thank Obama for that.  Treason is what Trump and his supporters will be known for.
4020 2018-02-03 01:13:16 I don’t even want to count up how much my stocks lost today. Guess I’ll add another couple years in to the work plan.
4021 2018-02-03 01:12:51 Vegas shooter had 10 minutes to fire 600 rounds (I believe those are the numbers) With 2-3 rifles and preloaded mags, even without bump stocks that number is functionally approachable.
4022 2018-02-03 01:12:12 @GoodNewsBull Not only that, but he really doesn't care what stocks do on a daily, weekly, monthly or even yearly basis. Think longer term.
4023 2018-02-03 01:11:33 Why would @realDonaldTrump do that when 1. he & friends are making bank on big pharma stocks, & 2. by leaving them alone with their huge shipments into Appalachian  coal country, the overdoses will offset the demands for bringing coal back, 3. same for PA steel towns. Trump wins.

4047 2018-02-03 01:05:52 Actually, it's because interest rates are going up, and people are pulling some of their money out of stocks, which may have maxed out, and balancing their portfolios with bonds.
4048 2018-02-03 01:05:23 The stocks lost me 2000 dollars today...
4049 2018-02-03 01:05:20 Beastly day for stocks... #666
4050 2018-02-03 01:04:32 Two days this week that stocks tanked:  after the Amazon/JPMorgan/Berkshire Hathaway news about lowering healthcare costs, and today. Better job opportunities, higher wages, and lower healthcare costs for workers are bad news for the investor/speculator class. Yay capitalism.
4051 2018-02-03 01:04:09 jype fucking up on stocks again its like they're purposefully trying to make us mad @jypnation @GOT7Official #GOT7
4052 2018-02-03 01:04:00 Hey Sean....

Will you be covering the economy today...particularly the DOW Jones today and lately??

Or wait..I suppose this was Obama's fault, right???? So stocks go up = trump..stocks go down = obama?? News that embarrass Trump = fake..news that flatter him = truth. Correct?
4053 2018-02-03 01:02:43 Way back when in HS, we had Econ, about the only thing I learned there was how to file taxes and to buy stocks. Buy when low, sell when they are high. I have someone else do my taxes now just because of all the stuff I have-house, stocks, bonds etc.
4054 2018-02-03 01:02:41 But maybe this is the beginning of a large market correction (dropping a large percent in value across many stocks/companies) - I’ll hold my Apple stock because I see my stock as a little piece of the company & not as a particular dollar balance.
4055 2018-02-03 01:02:36 I want to know how in the hell the Social Security System has ANYTHING to do with this POS in office I PAID MY DUES, I WILL NOT BE PUSHED OUT IN THE STREET AGAIN. 2009 LOST MY STOCKS, SAVINGS, HOME CONTRACT WITH COMPANY TO PROTECT MY SALARY, NOTHING LEFT. FUCK YOU IF THIS HAPPENS

4058 2018-02-03 01:01:54 and the stock market dropped , how come you are not taking any credit for that today.dow-plunges-665-points-as-stocks-post-worst-week-in-2-years.
4059 2018-02-03 01:01:50 Well no... depopulating stocks as bond yields go up makes sense, decreasing prices. Future federal fund rate increase expectations reduces stock prices. And of course, investors can be overenthusiastic after a large policy is enacted.

4068 2018-02-03 00:58:03 That doesn't make sense to me. I think cryptocurrency has an inverse relationship to stocks. It's like gold in that way.
4069 2018-02-03 00:56:26 27 green stocks... were all their daily volume under a thousand ?
4070 2018-02-03 00:55:58 Market needed this sell-off plus it was Friday,  many traders taking profits today before entering the weekend. Keep eyes on the $VIX. This will be key indicator if market is losing heat. $VIX skyrockets, selling will continue next week. #Stocks

4076 2018-02-03 00:54:09 Another possible angle...billions of dollars of 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) monthly contributions purchased mutual funds, etc., yesterday. I've often wondered if these contributions are gamed by the masters of the universe. But the bond market is nervous and that's hitting stocks.

4087 2018-02-03 00:50:19 Trump has today had the stocks drop off and he and the GOP are going to put the American people into another depression that will be worse then the great depression ( 20- 30s) .
4088 2018-02-03 00:50:11 Stocks dropped 666 points today.  Had my mom been in charge, someone would have been forced to buy or sell a few more stocks to end the day at 665 or 667... when I was a kid, if this rang up on a register, I got all excited because SOMEONE was getting a pack of Juicy Fruit!

4109 2018-02-03 00:46:00 Let’s see... we increase our deficit by trillions of dollars and interest rates are being pressured higher. Should we be surprised by weakness in bonds and stocks? Are we going to be able to grow our way out of this? Doubtful.
4110 2018-02-03 00:45:14 The DJIA fell 666 points today. Many feel this sell-off was much needed since traders are now referring to the "Trump Bump" as the "Trump Jump." I'm not worried about the Fed w/ interest rates. Job market is strong, earnings strong, inflation still flat. #Stocks
4111 2018-02-03 00:45:11 I haven’t received anything and my stocks plummeted cause the DOW dropped to a historic plummet. Let me guess, you’re gonna now not take credit for the stock market when it actually is your doing?

4125 2018-02-03 00:40:05 That is why Donald and Ivanka are so giddy happy about stocks going up.  When it tanks as it will, they will be raking in the dollars.

4127 2018-02-03 00:39:17 Yeah, I don't own any stocks outright, but my retirement money is all in 401-K's and heaven knows the Repugs will have done their best to dismantle Social Security by the time I can retire.
4128 2018-02-03 00:38:59 The Stocks Market has been the best it's been in years.

They can't make stocks quick enough to put people in.
4129 2018-02-03 00:38:44 Stocks
4130 2018-02-03 00:38:37 Market has never been above 26k either. So a 600 point drop is very minor in% terms. Small correction. Everything will be just fine. Decent buying opportunity on certain stocks.
4131 2018-02-03 00:37:59 For someone like me who doesn’t understand stocks and stuff, where specifically would you recommend I go to learn about these things, via eg vids, articles, books, webs, etc? Thx
4132 2018-02-03 00:37:47 Yea, ban those nasty bump stocks, and the crazies will stop killing people...what a fantastic cause to spearhead. I guess that's more important than helping to shelter the sixty thousand homeless in California
4133 2018-02-03 00:37:36 My mom is explaining what stocks she puts money into and blah blah like lady I don’t care unless you’re giving me fat stacks
4134 2018-02-03 00:37:19 But if sad years taught me anything - it's that all technical analysis for stocks works for positioning into buy, because overbought condition very-very-very rarely obviously traceable (there is no top if you thin like Buffi and that's actually make sense).
4135 2018-02-03 00:37:08 bump stocks wouldn't have done all that happened at Vegas that was way to rapid and furthermore, when will we ever get an update on that shooting no camera footage no nothing

Dude, the fundamentals are NOT there: when the SEC is shutting down an ICO, and exchanges are getting subpoenas... lmao strong fundamentals
4140 2018-02-03 00:35:20 On any given day any matured investors prefer, a strong capital market..with deeper bond market and a stable currency regime with wide array of stocks of companies to choose from. At last beginning it's to happen with domestic money coming in torrent. Why Crib ?
4141 2018-02-03 00:35:14 You read my mind. If we make a good amount after the oil fall, and if stocks are still in correction, then what an opportunity for some long term investments. Buy and hold Jimboman style :)
4142 2018-02-03 00:34:43 I know why the stocks fell. The joke is that the stock market has never been a good indicator of presidential success as the markets are insanely volatile. But he loves to tout a booming stock market and the day of his beloved memo's release, the market plunged.
4143 2018-02-03 00:34:39 same bro, have no idea
4144 2018-02-03 00:34:29 With all due respect Sen. Feinstein, the Republidiots ( @SenateGOP @HouseGOP ) just released classified information to the world.  They continue to give Trumpski a free reign - fighting for bump stocks is important, but our Democracy is in peril - where are the Democratic voices?
4145 2018-02-03 00:33:50 I'd really like Congress to quit playing around + get rid of bump stocks. Not asking for much; just common sense to reduce gun deaths.

4153 2018-02-03 00:29:59 A few private conversations would confirm I was calling a top and correction earlier this week, but its not about the credit. Its about what signalled it. First market chart. But most importantly for me pot stocks.
4154 2018-02-03 00:29:48 Stocks are down big guy. Don't make it sound all so wonderful. Let's talk in a year. 
Go play golf and dream up some more shit in your defense.
4155 2018-02-03 00:29:21 Which weed stocks do you still hold in your portfolio?
4156 2018-02-03 00:28:55 TELL THE TRUTH Stocks went down because of the explosive memo , showing the abuse of power by anti-trump FBI.
4157 2018-02-03 00:28:53 You have conveniently left out any mention of his efforts to pass gun control reforms such as: Banning bump-stocks, universal background checks, and "no fly, no buy".  It's misleading folks about his position and that equates an attack.
4158 2018-02-03 00:28:13 We’re still waiting for the full details too. EXCUSE ME? It was the last administration that APPROVED these bump stocks

4165 2018-02-03 00:25:34 Yes you can transfer $$ to equity trading platform using credit cards, but they are banning transfer of $$ from your credit card to crypto exchanges. Because as you know trading eg. penny stocks is much safer than cryptos 
4166 2018-02-03 00:24:43 Call it while it’s in the air: Eagles or Patriots? And does a Patriots win mean stocks will go down?
4167 2018-02-03 00:24:39 Lol plunges. Stock market hasn't had a correction in 9 years. It's well over dew 70% on stocks 50% on housing. Don't listen to media they are harlots it's all click bait and bigger agendas. Thanks for the crypto sale sheeple.
4168 2018-02-03 00:24:36 Having my stocks on an app makes it feel like a game. Not sure if this is a good thing
4169 2018-02-03 00:24:33 Investments are just like stocks, you buy them when they're at a low market price in hopes so there's low risk of losses, then you sell them off when they start to shoot up.
4170 2018-02-03 00:24:18 First, Stocks rose 38% since election and dropped 2% today. Still 36% growth!
Second, are you and the left now giving President Trump credit for economy? What happened to #ThanksObama ?

Gotta get their paycheck on prepaid cards.
4173 2018-02-03 00:23:45 seriously the worse one, trying to convince you coworkers in a brokerage that daytrading penny stocks is not a path to wealth!
4174 2018-02-03 00:23:25 Stocks are somewhat overpriced.  
Long bonds are far more overpriced. 
This point, if bonds correct, means in turn stocks are quite overpriced.
4175 2018-02-03 00:23:21 Regarding buying Currency/ Stocks at dips: If you don't wait, they could fall through support to next the level.
4176 2018-02-03 00:23:18 I’m no Trump fan but that’s just not an accurate read of events. Investors are leaving stocks because interest rates are forecast to rise, as will returns on bonds. Interest rates are forecast to rise in response to inflationary pressures as wages rise.
4177 2018-02-03 00:22:49 It’s a weird feeling when both stocks and crypto are crashing down hard.
4178 2018-02-03 00:22:21 Please explain why you're in favor of mass killings with bump stocks and children shooting other children in school.
4179 2018-02-03 00:22:18 omg today in economics we are doing stocks and GUESS WHAT my partners chose to invest in..............fucking TESLA!!!! i literally can’t escape david even if i wanted to
4180 2018-02-03 00:22:15 # Stocks Are Falling TRUMP!!!!????
4181 2018-02-03 00:22:12 Many tech stocks down today. Yet amazon and Netflix maintain their growth. I wonder why?
4182 2018-02-03 00:21:44 Nice clapping for yourself. By the way, stocks dropped bigly. Just saying.
4183 2018-02-03 00:21:29 Its okay to appeal to low volume, low float stocks that present optimism. DYR
4184 2018-02-03 00:21:23 Once a VIRUS enter an organization...the corporate MUST be cut out....let every agency start CUTTING.
#LET EVERY VOTER start CUTTING. @ny @donlemon @thehill @DanRather @BETNews @jaketapper

4185 2018-02-03 00:21:11 lmfao evn though bakugou the type to be like chocolates for the weak he’d still be hurt deep down inside when no one gets him any! Honestly I’ll be that bih who stocks his v day chocolate bc i lowkey love his angry ass
4186 2018-02-03 00:21:07 While stocks plummet. World knows Trump is a disaster
4187 2018-02-03 00:21:03 Wow.  666 Park (money laundering) Place and now the strangley FAST drop in stocks today with #MemoDay ..YOU TELL ME !!!!#ImpeachTrump
4188 2018-02-03 00:20:56 US stocks swoon, sending Dow down more than 650 points...Nikkei
4189 2018-02-03 00:20:41 Stocks suffer worst day in Trump Presidency with #EatSleepBreakStreak
4190 2018-02-03 00:20:18 Stocks dropped. Just saying.
4191 2018-02-03 00:19:57 I think Soros caused 666 stock market crash today to: divert news cycle from FISA Memo exposing Democrat crimes at highest levels, destroy Trump, who's approval is increasing due to strong economy, & GS bet against USA, losing $1B, could only make $ if stocks went down.
4192 2018-02-03 00:19:16 How about move away from the ledge? People take gains when stocks go up like they have. That means they sell. And by next week, people will rebuy and market will move higher still.
4193 2018-02-03 00:19:05 Y'all see how much DOW dropped this week? Stocks are looking pretty bad rn.
4194 2018-02-03 00:18:50 It’s market manipulation. (Just like crypto) I bought more stocks when they drop like 5% and sell the following day making a couple hundo to get me by the week 
4195 2018-02-03 00:18:22 Bump Stocks, Russian interference, even sanctions are ignored by Republicans. Instead they invent ways to discredit FBI & smear DOJ in favor of protecting persons with Russian ties & partisan politics. Republicans loyalty leans toward Criminals & Puten.
4196 2018-02-03 00:17:29 never fails. it is always the new generation of investors who goes through these experiences. parabolic moves, regulatory risk, things lk kodak, entrance into the normal vernacular are all signs of bubbles (at least w/ stocks, maybe in this sense btc is diff, but prob not).
4197 2018-02-03 00:17:23 caution, many of your pot stocks could still sell off another 100%, and on a long enough time line, they all will.
4198 2018-02-03 00:17:18 Agree stocks dropped over 1,000 points, largest drop in 2 years. But still above Bush era.  Concern is Fed. increasing interest rates & looming inflation. Tax cuts can stimulate economy but have negative impact like higher interest rates & inflation. Both eat up tax cuts.
4199 2018-02-03 00:17:10 You are so easily led! Trump TV strikes again. You all are laughing stocks!

4201 2018-02-03 00:16:10 Really cause my stocks went down a shit ton today?! Hmmm
4202 2018-02-03 00:15:44 If stocks keep dipping then ask me about The Buttonwood Agreement Birth Time.
#WeWillSee
4203 2018-02-03 00:15:36 @realDonaldTrump so, after your state of the uniom address, stocks fall, hmmmm, curios
4204 2018-02-03 00:14:15 @HalftimeReport if Al Michaels ever decides to call it quits behind the sports mic you better pick him up in hurry to come on the show. I’d watch him talk stocks all day long. Today was fun!
4205 2018-02-03 00:13:57 Stocks are a bubble, oh wait i meant Crypto currencies. @CNBC
4206 2018-02-03 00:13:18 I wonder how Trump will effect how the Asian stocks on Monday. I guess the weekend will tell.
4207 2018-02-03 00:13:14 All I'm saying really stocks are a volume game and we need to attract buyers. Buyers like news and catalyst. We need some! There's an army just waiting but we're all spinning wheels till then.
4208 2018-02-03 00:13:08 The CDC director just resigned because of selling stocks and we're in the middle of the worst flu season in years. Nobody cares.
4209 2018-02-03 00:12:24 The market corrects itself. It's an ebb and flow. My broker said this is because of speculation about rising interest rates. Diversify with both stocks and bonds because when one goes down the other goes up.
4210 2018-02-03 00:12:00 That assumes you bought the $spy etf. Many people chased over-extended high-octane stocks that have been trounced. #staircaseUpElevatorDown
4211 2018-02-03 00:11:50 It has been skyrocketing since Trump was elected. It had been rising but you can’t deny that the last 3 months have been spectacular for stocks.  I agree the memo caused it to drop but also think the market initially responded very positively to Trump
4212 2018-02-03 00:11:48 Don’t be fooled by celebrity endorsements in regards to stocks. A lot of them don’t even realize that they are just helping pieces of shit and if they do, then they are piece of shit. Peace.
4213 2018-02-03 00:11:10 It’s like how people buy gold because they think the value will rise. People who bought bitcoins before profited from the rise in value. Basically like stocks
4214 2018-02-03 00:10:52 @samstockley EY Stocks: Dingleberry’s shoeing me how to play Rollercoaster Tycoon HAHA, off to Lego Land ;-) xx
4215 2018-02-03 00:10:16 Nah some guy trading stocks and playing fortnite at the same time so he probably wasn’t good at either
4216 2018-02-03 00:10:01 Bump stocks are not the problem why do Democrats have such a hard time understanding guns do not kill people.  People kill people .
4217 2018-02-03 00:09:43 @realDonaldTrump dude, my stocks are down 3% today. Do better.
4218 2018-02-03 00:09:35  Stocks plummet!
4219 2018-02-03 00:09:35 Well if it's beef or chicken stocks you can.
4220 2018-02-03 00:09:33 You do have the right to remain silent. You should exercise that right.
4221 2018-02-03 00:09:19 #StockMarket now show'g it's #TrueColors It was only a matr of time b4 it crashed but I bet the #RichPricks already knew & sold off their stocks before they became THEIR loses, as usual, with insider trad'g be'g the order of the day. It'll continue to drop all under #TrumpsWatch
4222 2018-02-03 00:08:54 And then the stocks crashed!
4223 2018-02-03 00:07:57 One day does not change the market. A few stocks can lower the DOW several people made money today I can guarantee
4224 2018-02-03 00:07:47 We assumed #crypto and stocks were uncorrelated. But what do you make of today’s action?
4225 2018-02-03 00:07:45 Not so fast. The intrinsic value of stocks is still WAAAAY out of wack.
4226 2018-02-03 00:07:39 Only 2 companies on my radar as having tremendous upside are
 @GrnOrganicDutch & @gtec_holdings

I'll be interested in which one you've chosen,as for a bottom?  One can only hope but all stocks in the sector were overbought and there has been enough financings to drive sps down
4227 2018-02-03 00:07:33 Yeah it's telling you to sell your stocks and put your money under the mattress.
4228 2018-02-03 00:07:27 @jimcramer  Love to have you do a segment next week on Healthcare drug & companies stocks after Trump saying he going after drug companies
4229 2018-02-03 00:07:16 Chances are its a company not one person. Pensions and other stocks probably flourish from.their profits
4230 2018-02-03 00:07:12 Rising bond yields drove big swing in stocks in recent days as volatility returned to the market
4231 2018-02-03 00:07:02 You read all kinds of stories and opinions about cryptos right now for sure, but there have been some amazing gains in cryptos, i'm just watching them like i am some stocks, just waiting for the bleeding to stop until something is confirmed, i'll stay in cash for the moment.
4232 2018-02-03 00:06:58 Job report so good interest rate moved up so slightly. Profit takers make ppl act.Long game futures so bright I gotta wear shades. @realDonaldTrump
4233 2018-02-03 00:06:53 Laughing stocks of the universe 
4234 2018-02-03 00:06:49 Right up there with Pruitt's $25K soundproof booth, funneling 100K from kids with cancer for the Trump Org, Zinke/Pruitt's/Price's trips & a CDC director buying tobacco stocks. You really can't make this crap up. #BrendaFitzgerald #EPA #Zinke #WhitefishEnergy #EricTrumpFoundation
4235 2018-02-03 00:06:34 The wealthy do not become wealthier by investing in stocks, they get wealthier by investing in the imprisonment of the workers.
4236 2018-02-03 00:06:25 Ok I have a 3 year timeline.. so mix is cash and stocks? Bonds sucking
4237 2018-02-03 00:06:08 Banning bump stocks will not stop people dying from gunshots. People kill people. Fix our divided country and leave no one behind.
4238 2018-02-03 00:05:56 distracting from STOCKS TAKING A DIVE?
4239 2018-02-03 00:05:49 It was, I think the moon affected people lol - Trading stocks too?
4240 2018-02-03 00:04:25 Stocks are tanking all week, down 666 (!?) Today. Could it be that your shaky, unhinged leadership style is making investors nervous ? Likely
4241 2018-02-03 00:04:11 Stocks Market down -666 seems to be a fitting number 
4242 2018-02-03 00:03:51 Was Trump not President-ing today? Because stocks are down and Black unemployment is up. And I totally thought he’d fixed all that. Worried a plane crash could be next.
4243 2018-02-03 00:03:45 “Stocks have been rising pretty much in a straight line since November 2016, and that's not exactly healthy. Stock market analysts believe the stock market is long overdue for a 5% pullback or even a 10% correction.”
4244 2018-02-03 00:03:35 Monday. Data for my client accounts is end of week.  Yes.  In certain stocks.
4245 2018-02-03 00:03:26 Not to mention that the Dow Jones Industrial Average represents only a narrow range of stocks from similar companies. It's a poor indicator of overall equity performance.
4246 2018-02-03 00:03:20 Diane stole ip bump stocks invested in company set up shooter w torture economic terror pump n dump and gun terror plan resign Diane insider trading like Martha insider trading you and Nancy on Apple resign Nazi racist
4247 2018-02-03 00:02:54 That reminds me, with the market down 666 points today, it might be a good time to buy some liquor stocks.
4248 2018-02-03 00:02:37 Historic average of stock market is 10-11%.

Stocks went up 20% last year.

Your house will never appreciate by 15% annually, sorry.
4249 2018-02-03 00:02:10 Expanding optimism tends to be bullish for stocks. Peak optimism not so much - difficult in real time to know when that has occurred.
4250 2018-02-03 00:01:27 Basic economics, stocks hate higher interest rates. It’s the good and bad of a growing economy....
4251 2018-02-03 00:01:12 "The hallmark of every one of the best performing stocks throughout history is that they have extreme pullbacks.  These pullbacks are absolutely necessary for the success of a healthy stock." Jesse C. Stein
4252 2018-02-03 00:01:00 Also you can't eat or drink stocks. #WaterCrisis
4253 2018-02-03 00:00:46 Wow you idiots still think russia is behind Trump? you people are desperate and delusional. I'm gonna go ahead and say Thank You Putin for making our country economically stronger for the first time in decades. Jeez those Russians are really doing us a disservice with our stocks
4254 2018-02-03 00:00:08 from the GOP and its stock holders are up in arms because the Fed may raise interest rates...so stocks go down.  How is this any better than putting your money on red or black? I as a small investor do not have sway over the stock market or the roulette table...
4255 2018-02-03 00:00:00 4 months ago today marked the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with 59 people slaughtered. We’re still pushing our bill to ban bump stocks, which allowed a semi-automatic weapon to fire like a machine gun. It’s time for Republicans to get on board.

4257 2018-02-02 23:59:13 How can i find high volatile stocks to swing trade? What’s the best price range to buy stocks?
4258 2018-02-02 23:59:03 Stocks are tanking today
4259 2018-02-02 23:58:57 Stocks took the biggest hit in 10 years!  What’s going on Mr. Big shot????
4260 2018-02-02 23:58:52 @realDonaldTrump I knew you'd destroy the economy-Stocks lost 666 points, if I believed in the devil I'd believe you're the devil. It's all unravelling & not a moment too soon...
4261 2018-02-02 23:58:06 A lot of focus on the stock market and bitcoin today for sure and we thought otc stocks had v olatility, haha, but it does create opportunities usually at some point.
4262 2018-02-02 23:57:46 Also it is worth considering that the rise of stocks has mostly to do with tech which is producing real value. It’s not all hot air
4263 2018-02-02 23:57:32 How is Trump creating GOOD JOBS, 8 Trillion in new stock market$$ helping 401K's & Retirement pensions for unions, state retirements not 2 mention personally owned stocks & mutual funds reduced black & Hispanic unemployment 2 lowest rate N History reducing food stamp roles=resist
4264 2018-02-02 23:57:32 This a good opportunity to buy stocks, while the wall street rate addicts are panicking.
4265 2018-02-02 23:56:59 PSA: If you are selling today to re-buy at a lower price, you must likely will miss the buying opportunity on the way up, hurting even more your account. DON'T PANIC! #StockMarket #investing #stocks
4266 2018-02-02 23:56:57 Historic average of stock market is 7%. 8% is being generous. 

What if your stocks go down in value? What if my house appreciates by 15% annually?
4267 2018-02-02 23:56:46 onions, carrots, and celery for their stocks. Either way, just get chicken stock and have those spices I mentioned earlier and you got yourself some easy pho ga broth.  And those spices are good for your health and in some ways are medicinal.
4268 2018-02-02 23:56:22 @turbotax how do I report stocks that I sold several different times? I was gifted the stock earlier this year and sold shares off and on throughout the year.
4269 2018-02-02 23:55:37 Except for some weed stocks I still think has huge potienal. Alot of my money will be going into junior/exploration companies pluss a few medical ones. On a good note these usually bold well come late Feb March and summer drilling
4270 2018-02-02 23:55:37 About 1,000 pts. in the last couple of days. I follow the stocks daily & this shows another huge #TrumpFail full of lies. #DowJones #StockMarket Trickle down economics didn't work b4 & it's not going to work this time! #MuellerTime hurry!
4271 2018-02-02 23:55:23 Stocks are a bubble and way too volatile they should ban them
4272 2018-02-02 23:55:08 @realDenaldTrump your scandals are boring the crap out of us. Now the stocks are falling why? Oh yeah Clinton emails..
4273 2018-02-02 23:54:52 Hindsight is 20/20. Traders will "always" lose money by panic selling. If you don't feel comfortable holding your stocks for 10 years, then don't own them. This is the nature of the beast... #StockMarket #panicsell #investing

4296 2018-02-02 23:53:46 We! Lol. How are your stocks doing? Is your coal company reaping mad profits due to deregulation? As a big time CEO, how are you enjoying your tax break? At least ICE has removed the scores of illegals that are nowhere around you! Things are really looking up for us normies!
4297 2018-02-02 23:53:20 Uhhhh hello? Stocks are declining. Worst since your Presidency..
4298 2018-02-02 23:53:17 See the thing with stocks and the market. When the percentages are high, all though they have a higher value, they also have a higher cost.
4299 2018-02-02 23:52:53 Chart analyst: Bet on at least an 8 percent pullback for stocks...
4300 2018-02-02 23:52:38 The Dow suffered its worst drop in almost two and a half years Friday as US stocks plunged on disappointing earnings from big companies and worries about higher interest rates.  DOWN 666 points~ Donnies' #!
4301 2018-02-02 23:52:17 Trump speaks, stocks fall, claim it. Remember, no Republicans should watch the Superbowl. Your president doesn't think the players respect the flag. #Dumptrump
4302 2018-02-02 23:52:09 Isn't it the other way around? ie. Normal' being more like stocks down / bond yields down? Someone else also called the session risk-off, which is an odd way to describe risk assets AND  safe assets both being sold ...
4303 2018-02-02 23:51:56 i'll be having stocks at yoicon but i can't assure that i'll have stocks of the stamps for each chara ;o;
4304 2018-02-02 23:51:17 @sonicmerlin @CryptoCapital are you trading stocks or want to be the police?
4305 2018-02-02 23:50:55 Lots of willful misreading of stock market today. It’s really simple - tax cuts are in the bag. Future profits much harder to hit, so stocks fall.
4306 2018-02-02 23:50:45 Since Trump took credit for stocks market rise, I am sure he will accept blame for today's plunge....Not. Narcissists can't. Dow plunges 666 points -- worst day since Brexit
4307 2018-02-02 23:50:16 Look at all those stocks the guy mention literally one or two days from the top I think they have a long way to go down
4308 2018-02-02 23:50:14 Not everybody. Less than 50% of Americans own stocks or mutual funds. Nearly half of families have no retirement account savings at all, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), even in savings vehicles such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
4309 2018-02-02 23:49:59 #BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points. ~ M
4310 2018-02-02 23:49:59 If I bought stocks the day before the 2008 crisis, how would I be doing?  Short termism and Long term pessimism are equally stupid
4311 2018-02-02 23:49:44 ...And the #Memo geopolitically #Stocks...!
4312 2018-02-02 23:49:09 I work for a CPA and I overheard him say last week that the wealthy are calling to ask what they should do about their stocks. They are happy with the returns so far but have all been scared the trend would reverse.
4313 2018-02-02 23:48:14 Imma live edit those stocks down to 0 feel me.

4314 2018-02-02 23:48:02 I would like to see full transparency from CNBC broadcasters & contributors, not just what stocks they are in. Show political affiliations, contributions, etc. From their commentary, it’s fairly obvious what side they’re on.
4315 2018-02-02 23:47:56 Trump is right, we will be unified. As stocks go down, economic will eventually get hit as nations pull away from the US it can't have a positive outcome. Cutting healthcare and programs for those in need & rich getting richer most will suffer so we'll bond all right!
4316 2018-02-02 23:47:48 Get ready to meet the analysts! Next Monday we will be announcing who is on the analyst team. Portfolio Manager(PM) Raymundo Prieto will also be going over the stocks we currently hold and PM Taehoon Kim will be giving you tips on your resume. See you Monday at 5pm in BLB 055.
4317 2018-02-02 23:47:32 Great time to BUY stocks!

4319 2018-02-02 23:46:55 I’m looking forward to see which companies’ stocks are gonna boom after Super Bowl commercials.
4320 2018-02-02 23:46:41 Buy more tech stocks #Nvidia
4321 2018-02-02 23:46:38 Yeah, that was a terrible year to own stocks.  If I bought your gold the day before black Monday vs stocks, how much poorer would I be?
4322 2018-02-02 23:46:10 Bump stocks... where the hell did that go?

Away.
4323 2018-02-02 23:45:51 Democrat fund mgrs. can sell off today, cause a huge stock market crash, divert the news away from the exposure of high level Democrats' crimes, then buy stocks back very cheaply tomorrow. #FalseFlag #FISAMemo #CrimesByDemocrats I cry "foul".  Soros Hedge Funds & related?

4326 2018-02-02 23:44:01 What is the better penny stock to put money in and why? #pennystock #stocks #StockMarket
4327 2018-02-02 23:43:15 First Dennis Edwards, now John Huntsman Sr. passed away...BAD SIGN for #GroundhogDay2018! What's also worse? Stocks went down (Devils Numbers) 666 points...SMH! #WorstFridayEver #WorstDayEver #GroundhogDay
4328 2018-02-02 23:42:52 And the Stock Market begins record downturn. Nunes memo release causing anxiety with investors. Confidence in McDonald Trump's administration way down and Stock Market reflects that fact. Where is Trump taking credit for Stocks now?
4329 2018-02-02 23:42:39 I suspect people who follow the market or have stocks don't need you to keep them informed.
4330 2018-02-02 23:41:20 Rising stocks prices does not equal rising wages or low unemployment. Rising stocks equal increase in 401Ks. How many Americans have 401Ks?
4331 2018-02-02 23:41:11 $WFC this is how big sector corrections start.  It’s bad news in important stocks that affect other companies in the sector.  Self fulfilling profecy of a bigger correction.
4332 2018-02-02 23:40:55 Yup, seen the highs for 2018, won't be seeing those again for a long time! Today was ugly for a lot of stocks, I had 27 green stocks in the basket I follow. New money got destroyed, lots of ppl are upset. MJ has to find its base, and it will probably take some time.
4333 2018-02-02 23:40:29 Stocks plunged 666 points today. Just an observation.
4334 2018-02-02 23:40:27 FBI = 13,000 strong
Donald Trump = 1 weak individual. 
I can even sell stocks speculating on this fact

4336 2018-02-02 23:39:31 meanwhile, stocks take a plunge as people begin to fear inflation and an overheated economy... lol something's gonna give
4337 2018-02-02 23:39:21 @realDonaldTrump so are you going to take credit for the satanic drop (666) in the stock market today? You take credit for all the gains. It goes both ways you moron. #StockMarket #DowJones #stocks #666 #UnfitToBePresident
4338 2018-02-02 23:39:12 And what are stocks and Wallstreet doing these days...Focus on real news for a dat or two before returning to fake news as real news is to difficult or boring. Lets buy a pump and dump coin $Bcrash Lets buy a dead coin, no dev NO nothing $NAUT Lets see how to buy the top $XRP.
4339 2018-02-02 23:39:08 I invested all my money in silly orange hat stocks.
4340 2018-02-02 23:39:07 Was today in #stocks really any different than the last two months? In either direction, the only sane response has been to shrug and think "sure...whatever you say, Mr. Market."
4341 2018-02-02 23:39:05 Your stocks took a dive thanks to your memo fools FYI: Dow is down 552 points, or 2.11% and is on track for its worst single-day point decline since June 24, 2016.
4342 2018-02-02 23:38:20 Albert Edwards' Double Bubble Trouble: stocks are headed for a HUGE reckoning   Alan Greenspan (Fed chair 1987-2006) made similar comments on Bloomberg. Both asset classes are in a bubble. He attributes bond situation to debt that has risen "very significantly."
4343 2018-02-02 23:38:19 Time to buy stocks. They will go back up next week. Always do.
4344 2018-02-02 23:37:04 To everyone who is complaining.... its a risky game. If you cant take the heat, get out. Go to penny stocks, you can win biiig, you can lose all. Same here or any other pool.
4345 2018-02-02 23:36:37 The Dow Jones (Stock Market) is down. Good! Now is the time to buy! We all know the stocks will rise again. Who likes to play the Stock Market? I do!
4346 2018-02-02 23:36:29 Hold on to them stocks, never selling my amazon stock
4347 2018-02-02 23:36:20 What is this going to do for turk girlfriend stocks?
4348 2018-02-02 23:35:36 No proof Putin help. Yeah stocks are down and companies aren’t investing in USA and people aren’t getting raises this is terrible
4349 2018-02-02 23:35:27 But if stocks are up then we all get more bonuses
4350 2018-02-02 23:35:16 @realDonaldTrump you should be ashamed of your self! Was Steele right? Surveillance of Carter Page had been going on for years. Stocks plummet as you play politics!
4351 2018-02-02 23:34:56 MARKET NEWS: Dow plunges 665 points as stocks eye worst week in 2 years

Still waiting for Trumps Tweet for taking the credit.
4352 2018-02-02 23:34:53 Can we keep talking about the DOW and other "traditional stocks"? I like seeing this flash of FUD hit those who doubt us

#cryptocurrency #bitcoin #BTC #ETH
4353 2018-02-02 23:34:18 Stocks are much more predictable then bitcoin
4354 2018-02-02 23:34:13 so you think the economy is booming ? the dollar is down higher rates means bonds are down and now stocks going down
4355 2018-02-02 23:33:53 Selling a lemon of a business to the market as a successful business, you are bound to fail sooner or later. Investors study stocks before you buy them. You may fall into the trap of getting stocks that really have no value.
4356 2018-02-02 23:33:27 Jim Cramer takes a second look at the tech titans' stocks after Thursday's earnings reports and Friday's market drop.
4357 2018-02-02 23:33:04 This is exactly what I am talking about!!!! How is a nightmare out of the question at this point? In a show where the enchanted forest has a Walmart that stocks gas and magic beans! Oh, and where Regina needs to be brought to justice for murdering Wish Snowing!!!
4358 2018-02-02 23:32:56 Wonder if people are tanking crypto markets, pulling out of stocks, then going to pile it all into crypto 
4359 2018-02-02 23:32:50 Only my bestfriend would encourage & dare me to send dog pick up lines to a guy
4360 2018-02-02 23:32:43 We are down about 3% from the highs. Been 15months since a 5% drop, and two years since a 10% correction...which are normal/healthy in bull markets. The investors suddenly enthusiastic about stocks arent prepared for normal levels of risk, so this may stay jumpy.
4361 2018-02-02 23:32:34 I believe I have said several times not to measure economy by stock market because it would soon correct itself. history has shown us that after every tax cut or change stocks go crazy just before they come crashing down
4362 2018-02-02 23:32:29 $SPY My stocks to avoid list apparently isn't needed tonight.
4363 2018-02-02 23:32:19 Stocks tumble 675+. Thanks, 45*
4364 2018-02-02 23:32:08 Don't see you taking credit for the stocks today...
4365 2018-02-02 23:31:53 Thanks, I didn't know the connection but that leaves me to the same conclusion that it's a bad sign that stocks suffer when workers are benefitting.
4366 2018-02-02 23:31:20 I don’t know what I’m doing when I invest-i just watch the stock market and see where my stocks are. I do kick myself for not buying more of Ford when it was lower. That was dumb on my part. 2/2
4367 2018-02-02 23:31:20 Agree. Even if there is some recent correlation it doesn't prove anything. And no reason that Bitcoin can't do really well if the stock market tanks. Alts may get REKT, but BTC should do well if people panic about stocks and the dollar.
4368 2018-02-02 23:31:13 Stocks tumble 675+. Thanks, 45*
4369 2018-02-02 23:30:55 Is the Dow gonna bounce back or is the bond market just gonna kick stocks in the crotch for the next little while?

4371 2018-02-02 23:30:33 I doubt it because stocks already went down today. This type of stuff smears our country too bad. But Obama presidency will almost be forgotten because all these Democrats know that he did this. They know!! #Obama #TheStormIsHere

4376 2018-02-02 23:28:03 Did the money hungry DEMS make the market drop like a rock? Six they dump stocks to do this? I wouldn't put any thing past them mulipulating the stock market
4377 2018-02-02 23:27:49 Omg yes and I know how it will start:

But I simply call her, Martha."
4378 2018-02-02 23:27:44 Actually, higher interest rates make stocks less attractive.  #SpecialReport

4384 2018-02-02 23:25:28 DJIA plunged 666 points today. You may think I am freaked out, bot no! I am laughing as money from pay will be showing up next week, when stocks are cheaper! This is what dollar cost averaging is all about! 
4385 2018-02-02 23:25:22 Stocks tumble 600+
4386 2018-02-02 23:24:59 Sure, but if they really wanna save many lives this isn't gonna work. They killed a ban on bump stocks yesterday and all sorts of other legislation since the session began. This, in my opinion, is less about doing good and more about looking good.
4387 2018-02-02 23:24:57 My stocks are doing great but I still hate Trump.

4391 2018-02-02 23:24:03 Well you know what’s next- the Lily- livered coward Donald  Trump will blame either Hiliary Clinton or Barack Obama for the decline in stocks.  @realDonaldTrump @congress_usa

4393 2018-02-02 23:23:32 The economy is more influenced by consumers and not profit speculation, so now that the investors see inflation on the horizon, THEY KNOW consumers will spend less and profits will suffer, and as a result stocks plummet.
4394 2018-02-02 23:23:27 i've heard it's all speculation on interest rates. i dunno much about stocks but another case where speculation by media on stocks perfectly acceptable don't matter how many it affects but don't dare speculate on the race / religion of a suicide bomber or lunatic truck driver
4395 2018-02-02 23:23:02 Stocks pummeled? It's only 669 points. Get over yourself, damn.
4396 2018-02-02 23:22:49 I just think there is ahuge difference making an income off wages/alary and owningassets like land or stocks and making money off that. And if you work then you should try to be making it so you and your coworkers make as much as possible
4397 2018-02-02 23:22:48 Pretty much you invest in various stocks but every person that signs up w/ your link they get a free stock and so do you and I believe @Sp1d3r003 got a stock in Facebook for just signing up

4404 2018-02-02 23:18:27 Stock market goes down 2% and the media loses their minds. Ironic because the top 10% own 84% of all stocks, so we’re meant to pity rich people taking losses they will barely feel. Only schadenfreude here. I hope we see more of this.

4408 2018-02-02 23:16:49 That’s because stocks did NOT plunge.  They dropped 2%.

4412 2018-02-02 23:15:11 DOW drops by 2.5% and people start Black Monday comparisons.  Keep in mind that was over a 22% drop.  We shed 6k points or more, time to sell over valued stocks.  Otherwise it's a correction

2) Very weak fundamentals: stocks buy-back pumped by central banks policies (negative interest rates).

4422 2018-02-02 23:13:09 Weird, I don't see @realDonaldTrump apologizing for the worst week in 2 years for stocks. Didn't he take all responsibility for the market?
4423 2018-02-02 23:13:07 So, how much did you help stocks today? @realDonaldTrump
4424 2018-02-02 23:12:51 Again,b.s.those bonuses,like most large companies are given yearly anyway,200,000 jobs,but carrier,harley-davidson lost thousands of jobs,U don't mention that,the largest drop in history in stocks today,down 600pts.We have to pay for that tax cut with large tax increase to come!!
4425 2018-02-02 23:12:25 Even dumber if he realized that almost none of the “forgotten men and women” who voted for him benefit from stocks going up because they don’t own any.
4426 2018-02-02 23:11:46 Why not to take advantage of stocks that have not appreciated for long LONG time, unjustly beaten down along with overpriced PIGS - #FANG, $BA etc. Small #biotech noble technology and #generic names are selling like they will never make it!! $ADXS $AGEN $ADRO $CLDX $FPRX $ENDP

I hope your Wall Street pals give you their thanks as well. In fact, I urge them all to seek you out & personally thank you

4441 2018-02-02 23:06:57 I can agree here. Shouldn’t be able to buy any stocks etc on credit. Treated like a cash advance does make sense even if I hate these two businesses. There are ways around this though.
4442 2018-02-02 23:06:40 I think the stocks are dropping because they know an indictment is coming soon for Trump and his team. ;)

4444 2018-02-02 23:05:59 Ok I get it now, so anything in the US that happens that is beneficial and positive like stocks and jobs is due to all the good things Obama did for the nation (sarcasm), and anything bad that happens anywhere else, including unforeseen acts of nature, are all Trump's fault.
4445 2018-02-02 23:05:53 I hope i can get all of the things (exo albums, d.o iPhone case) that i want so badly, i hope sum coexartium still have the stocks  #myGraduationPresents 
4446 2018-02-02 23:05:37 Could it have anyting to do with DJT? He only takes credit for ups, forgets the downs. He who lives by the stock market dies by the stock market. Idiot he is doesnt even realize it doesnt have anything to do with average americans, most dont own stocks.
4447 2018-02-02 23:05:14 Smarter than you know. Show annual gdp, cpi, and wage growth against change in stocks and 10yr  Treasury. Less correlated than most assume.

4449 2018-02-02 23:04:26 Ta, but may well turn to dust before handover! I shall hope for local stocks/not be such a crown dolt on next trip to Manc.
4450 2018-02-02 23:03:39 Well a month or ao ago I put half my money in Bitcoin and the rest in stocks. Time to check the financial news and see how much I made!
4451 2018-02-02 23:03:28 #Obama brought unrest upon our economy today as we saw the damage he did to the DOJ & FBI so the drop in stocks is his fault.
4452 2018-02-02 23:03:26 I'm so glad I don't have any stocks 
4453 2018-02-02 23:03:09 It’s those durn 50 cal Revolver pistols with the bump stocks that I’m concerned about.
4454 2018-02-02 23:03:06 Thanks for the updates on companies giving bonuses to employees - employees deserve the bonuses and a lot more. Can we also get a listing of companies using their #taxreform windfall to buy back stocks? Or ones who have decided to pocket their tax savings? #276daysandcounting
4455 2018-02-02 23:03:04 UPDATE: Dow settles down 665.75 points after falling 696 points briefly before the close, capping the worst week for stocks in 2 years.
4456 2018-02-02 23:02:37 @cvpayne "Fat Cat" DEMs selling off stocks to punish President Trump! Hope they get crushed with their "shorts" showing! Very unattractive!
4457 2018-02-02 23:02:22 When words have NO meaning...
4458 2018-02-02 23:02:14 Sadly overdue for the fall correction-just hope it’s not the beginning of the bubble bursting.
Most Citizens don’t own stocks, now there will be no ‘trickle down’, no wage increases, & more BS & lies from the 1%. The Obama legacy & good economy is just dirt under the 1% shoe now.
4459 2018-02-02 23:02:10 Where can I find somewhere who stocks these
4460 2018-02-02 23:02:08 Poor lady. We should bring back the stocks for scum like this
4461 2018-02-02 23:01:16 @funder Fall in stocks not about Trump. The catalyst for Friday’s fall appears to be a government report that shows the strong United States economy might finally be translating into rising wages for American workers. Wall Street hates that.
4462 2018-02-02 23:01:15 Stocks and Bitcoin were amazing to be today...made enough to go to the Superbowl twice....still don't think I'm going though lol
4463 2018-02-02 23:01:03 50 day...some stocks are still high fliers in fantasy land.
4464 2018-02-02 23:00:56 @realDonaldTrump   Did you check your stocks today?
4465 2018-02-02 23:00:53 This franchise is just stupid. Top to bottom.  Let’s sit Giannis for entire games to rest his knee but have him practice 6 hours the day after a game. Last night let’s have him play meaningless minutes in a blow out.  This is why they will never ascend to the heights they sell.
4466 2018-02-02 23:00:23 Yeah - build them a water damaged, patchwork, unpainted mansion.

Your elite lifestyle is showing.  How’s your stocks doing today?
4467 2018-02-02 23:00:17 Dow stocks down 666
On release of Memo so the Universe is telling us something? #behonest
4468 2018-02-02 22:59:12 IF you're in the Stock Market, I suggest learning about ETFs, low or zero fee funds that merely track different sectors. SPY tracks the S&P 500 (large companies). Some track mid-cap stocks. Others only use a foreign index. Some track only the tech sector (QQQ).
4469 2018-02-02 22:59:10 Stocks down today! Sad! Very bad for US.
4470 2018-02-02 22:59:07 Only 10 MJ's "green" today (5 owned) while 45 MJ's were "red" in my list of 55 MJ stocks....not too bad, though I had 9 MJ's down that I own also.  Happy weekend all!!!
4471 2018-02-02 22:59:06 Stocks aree not falling because minimum wage hike !!!! 
Stocks are falling because of uncertian investment into bonuses. Pensions. Health plan by corp.
Create less balance on corp books 
Witch cause uncertainty in markets
4472 2018-02-02 22:58:50 Have a feeling that this is going to be a fun @Marketplace today. Stocks go up ... and all.
4473 2018-02-02 22:58:15 This has nothing to due to Trump.  It’s smart investors taking their money out of stocks and putting it in bonds since the yield is going up.
4474 2018-02-02 22:58:04 Hitting stocks today ....not minimum wage hikes
4475 2018-02-02 22:58:03 We're melting havr to find something negitive since it rose 6000 points and my stocks are up 30%. You hypocritical libs better not have any consertive money in stocks.
4476 2018-02-02 22:58:01 Nah. I just reallocated my money and put 20K in stocks. That does it every time.
4477 2018-02-02 22:57:42 Dems are so ridiculous! There only tactic is to criticize a great president. Also Stocks values depend on current values and perceived future values
4478 2018-02-02 22:57:26 @realDonaldTrump what the fuck happened to my stock market gainz today? I listened to you and dumped all my money in stocks and now I'm broker than I was before.
4479 2018-02-02 22:57:00 Re: the investments--been a different type of week. We've been accustomed to stock market drops causing a flight to Treasury bonds and their prices going up. This instead is Treasury rates going up (prices down) and stocks repricing pv of future earnings (stock prices down too).
4480 2018-02-02 22:56:23 LOL. As I am doing a big write up on Stocks. The markets are correcting.
4481 2018-02-02 22:56:19 Hey Genius...You released the DUD memo and now the stocks are dropping!! Wall Street knows it's a dud..
#DUDMEMO
4482 2018-02-02 22:56:08 A reminder that half of Americans have *no* money in the stock market (not even 401Ks). The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks.

Wall Street doesn't run parallel to Main Street.
4483 2018-02-02 22:56:06 Okay we know who takes the credit for stocks going up... who’s fault is it that this is the worst week in 2 years?
4484 2018-02-02 22:55:53 Around 85% of stocks we own (by weighting in portfolio) have no debt and spare cash.
4485 2018-02-02 22:55:45 I never read a book for stocks I google everything
4486 2018-02-02 22:55:03 CNBC: "U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher."
4487 2018-02-02 22:55:01 The #StockMarket dumped almost 700 points today. Which means Monday is going to be a major BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!!!  don't be scared off by this! Get excited by it. This is a chance to get into #stocks that needed a pullback.
4488 2018-02-02 22:54:27 1.3% decline in $CAD 2day reinforces why I'm generally against USD-hedging. To a Canadian investor 2days 2% decline in U.S. stocks translated to a .7% (roughly) decline translated to CAD. USD has a negative correlation w/ risk assets
4489 2018-02-02 22:53:40 I'm sick and I lost a bunch of money in stocks today. #FunFactFriday
4490 2018-02-02 22:53:28 Stocks took biggest drop since 2008. THAT’S ON YOU!!!  Why aren’t you crowing about that. LOCK HIM UP!!!
4491 2018-02-02 22:53:17 Sell off in Stocks today likely continue: Rising Yields, one problem - but geopolitical instability on Trump Vs North Korea propaganda causing uncertainty - but - insto's may have figured out  - $500B Crypto money flow - is missing from stock markets.  #bitcoin #stocks #Cryptos
4492 2018-02-02 22:53:15 IF true, Wouldn’t that make it even WORSE ?
4493 2018-02-02 22:53:13 honestly, online is pretty much the only way nowadays. unless you can find some small out of the way place that stocks it
4494 2018-02-02 22:52:58 CNBC : "U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher."
4495 2018-02-02 22:52:52 Looks like stocks are plummeting, can't say I'm surprised
4496 2018-02-02 22:52:51 Another good reason to put some money into dividend-paying stocks. And to keep cash on the side for buying opportunities like this.
4497 2018-02-02 22:52:43 Interesting $TWTR getting get wacked like I thought it would during todays sell off. #stocks #investing
4498 2018-02-02 22:52:26 DOW plunged 665 points today.

If I could afford to buy stocks, I'd have lost my ass today.
4499 2018-02-02 22:52:18 Angelina most people lost money in the market the last few days.. i know I sure did and I’m sure bird did too... we shouldn’t blame, we need to be responsible for our own trades.. penny stocks are very high risk
4500 2018-02-02 22:52:15 Lmao they got it right ! Trump and the GOP are laughing stocks !
4501 2018-02-02 22:51:46 @mortgageconsult @realDonaldTrump touted African American unemployment rate & that tanked today; like stocks & his memo.
4502 2018-02-02 22:51:45 Now that the market scared millenials out, stocks and cryptos can go back up.
4503 2018-02-02 22:51:44 I hope all his money is in the stocks that tanked. He sucks
4504 2018-02-02 22:51:43 Hey, Donald. Are you going to take credit for the (almost) 700 point drop in the stocks today? Asking for a friend. @realDonaldTrump
4505 2018-02-02 22:51:23 #nowever Are they calling it Black Friday yet?  #BlackFriday #stocks #dow #DOWnsizing #StockMarket #SellOff #MiniCrash
4506 2018-02-02 22:51:13 Don't forget black unemployment went up 7.7.  Tell whole truth. Stocks down 665
4507 2018-02-02 22:51:11 You are boring. A 700 drop is just the stock traders using the memo as an excuse to trade into for a big cashin. That is basic stocks. It will rebound and break another record in less then a week. Likely only a couple days.
4508 2018-02-02 22:50:45 I figured Devin Nunes shorted a ton of stocks today.
4509 2018-02-02 22:50:31 On the radio this morning:

4511 2018-02-02 22:49:58 @CNBCFastMoney why do you spend 15 to 20% of your show each night covering crypto? Stocks effect 100% of your audience while crypto is of interest to about 2% of us.  Stop constantly talking up crypto. We don’t care. I know @RiskReversal and BK care but we don’t!
4512 2018-02-02 22:49:54 Overvalued stocks dont lead to a crash. They are overvalued right now due to the feds unrealistically low intrest rates. This is a healthy market
4513 2018-02-02 22:48:49 Decent stocks at half the fair price? Bring it on! :)
4514 2018-02-02 22:48:06 Stocks tend to fluctuate.

4515 2018-02-02 22:47:53 So glad I bought a "not a flamethrower" now. Could be the last time this ever happens. Meanwhile Ak47s and Bump Stocks are free game.
4516 2018-02-02 22:47:44 #ibb #xbi #stocks wrote some covered calls on my LT positions few weeks ago & was kicking myself 4 missing some of this crazy upside -looking like a good move now-stay diversified & don’t use margin-mkt always comes back in time
4517 2018-02-02 22:47:25 Why I love Volatility. 
My best year trading was 2008-2009
Options on ETFs and Currencies tripled in a week.
Dip buys on stocks using calls printed money.
Options on Commodity ETFs exploded 
A Global Macro Traders Dream 
I think 2018 could be just as volatile and lucrative
4518 2018-02-02 22:47:09 The essence of neoliberalism is praising a president when stocks go up even as inequality rises and wages stagnate, then slamming a president when wages go up causing stocks to fall.

Doesn't matter who the presidents are. That's bad economics, and bad liberalism.
4519 2018-02-02 22:47:07 Would a canine fur who trades in stocks and bonds be a Borker?
4520 2018-02-02 22:47:02 US bond yields up, bullish jobs = fund $ move out of stocks into bonds for asset class rebalance, cant have overweight stocks managing billions. Bullish jobs good 4 economy, growth. Commodities supercycle kicking off. Trend long, buy dips unless reversal confirmation stop loss
4521 2018-02-02 22:46:53 I've been planning for awhile, but today's crash hurt my stocks. My goal is to retire from the day job and pursue writing full-time. So happy you're able to live comfortably. I'm comfortable too... due to the 40 hours at my day job and the 20 hours a week I spending writing.
4522 2018-02-02 22:46:35 US bond yields up, bullish jobs = fund $ move out of stocks into bonds for asset class rebalance, cant have overweight stocks managing billions. Bullish jobs good 4 economy, growth. Commodities supercycle kicking off. Trend long, buy dips unless reversal confirmation stop loss
4523 2018-02-02 22:46:19 Thanks..you got some solid stocks in your portfolio. Keep the game up. Cheers
4524 2018-02-02 22:46:12 Does your company have any stocks available?
4525 2018-02-02 22:46:09 follow this: the rich bought stocks raising the stock price, then they sell it, then buy it back. double dip. they win & middle class loses.
4526 2018-02-02 22:45:54 and this was not the case with the nifty fifty in the 1960s or railway stocks in the 1800s?
4527 2018-02-02 22:45:36 @robertmarawa Conte sucks. About time he leaves. Chelsea has now joined Real Madrid and Arsenal as laughing stocks
4528 2018-02-02 22:45:33 Government never has anything to do with stocks. Free market is influenced by demand.
4529 2018-02-02 22:44:58 @realDonaldTrump Donald, black unemployment went back up to 7.7% in Jan. Are you going to tweet about that? How about the 666 point drop in “the stocks” are you going to tweet about that. How about the increase in inflation or the big jump in mortgage rates? It’s all yours now!
4530 2018-02-02 22:44:38 its positive to get some of the rsi off from jan and things move super fast now with the algos      could be another 500 pts down but stocks start buying back stock nextweek   should stablize     unless the short vix algos blow up since there are tons of those being run
4531 2018-02-02 22:44:27 Did you get stocks you believe in for the long term? Could still work out :)
4532 2018-02-02 22:44:22 He’s not to blame The market if you know anything about the stock market, fluctuates all the time, it does not mean that it will sit there at that particular status, nor does it mean that it will crash!  In fact I’m Canadian, and my stocks have been doing well, hang on ppl! 
4533 2018-02-02 22:44:09 @ChrisCuomo fake news said stocks fell because of Trump . That’s once again fake news . Falling oil prices and rising interest rates . Why do you guys push this fake shit , explain
4534 2018-02-02 22:43:59 And stocks take the worst drop I. 2 years #thanksTrump #removeNunes #TrumpRussia
4535 2018-02-02 22:43:47 For anybody that thinks that stock markets are a barometer of economic health consider that "US stocks ended their worst week in two years... the catalyst appeared to be a report that showed the strong economy might finally be translating into rising wages for American workers."
4536 2018-02-02 22:43:46 Fear or just time to milk the cows.
The System of Gambling has Manipulators.
When Stocks stop increasing madly 
Those that can Cash out & cash up
4537 2018-02-02 22:43:32 By the way did you see Stocks down 666! You devil
4538 2018-02-02 22:43:30 steve went on a mad one and made jake fire her for no reason
4539 2018-02-02 22:43:28 (2/2) With that being said, I can't say if it'll be a positive or negative year for stocks in 2018. I will say that they're not in a bubble. Good time to buy some dips for some great deals for some long term investments. Just avoid Amazon and Tesla though IMO.
4540 2018-02-02 22:43:22 Associated Press: US stocks swoon, sending Dow down more than 650 points
4541 2018-02-02 22:43:21 Worried the economy is doing well => fed will raise rates => opportunity cost of hold stocks will be higher? Also maybe EU and Japan cut back on QE.
4542 2018-02-02 22:42:58 Fighting and LOSING the battle against compulsively applying to a million summer stocks at this time of year.
4543 2018-02-02 22:42:52 The end times have arrived. Everyone should send all their stocks, bonds, Bitcoin to me. I will bravely remain on Earth with your money.
4544 2018-02-02 22:42:35 We mourn for our fallen stocks as our citizens get shot by cops and murdered by bigots. This is the USA in 2018, and I'm getting real tired of it out here.
4545 2018-02-02 22:42:19 (1/2) As much as I'll say oil is in a mini bubble, I won't say stocks are in a bubble. This is just a healthy correction in stocks. Remember, we have low interest rates. In the 1990s, the rate on a 30 year Treasury Bond was over 5%. Today we just reached 3 during a correction.
4546 2018-02-02 22:42:14 I think trumps millionaire friends used their big tax breaks and bought back all their own stocks. Now the rich get richer. And the poor die
4547 2018-02-02 22:42:14 Apple and these other notable stocks are already in a correction...
4548 2018-02-02 22:42:10 Haha, I was just kidding, I know what's going on the last few days. But I'm not worried, time to transfer more money to buy stocks
4549 2018-02-02 22:42:06 I don’t trade JNJ, but selling puts in stocks (you like and have fallen excessively) is a great way to take advantage of the increased volatility.
4550 2018-02-02 22:42:06 So if I was Trump on this big #MemoDay ,and that number fell out in the stocks I touted, I'd go in hiding.
4551 2018-02-02 22:41:51 Do you know anything about stocks ? 2.57% is a huge deal !

4563 2018-02-02 22:40:45 Today's "plunge" in stocks the biggest since June 2016, a month when the #sp500 peaked around 2100 (currently 30% higher).

4566 2018-02-02 22:40:27 It's called an adjustment.  History shows it's predictable.  Stocks are still way higher than a year ago.  Take a deep breath, sit down and relax.

4576 2018-02-02 22:37:05 Let’s see... we increase our deficit by trillions of dollars and interest rates are being pressured higher. Should we be surprised by weakness in bonds and stocks? Are we going to be able to grow our way out of this? Doubtful.
4577 2018-02-02 22:37:01 No, we should buy more stocks
4578 2018-02-02 22:37:01 Btw my share of stocks looking nice for Monday. 
4579 2018-02-02 22:36:59 @TheLastLeg 
Its not just F1 that's in this game,
Stocks and speedway are just the same;
You have to look at the reason why,
You never see a traffic light guy;
So to answer the question,
And in this I'm not kidding;
The answer is this,
it objectifies women.
4580 2018-02-02 22:36:45 No, but my stocks  lost a grip in the past 2 days 
4581 2018-02-02 22:36:45 Initiated an $ENB holding at 3% of single stocks. Increased $GOOG and $RHHBY to 4% each. Cash is 12% of assets now.
4582 2018-02-02 22:36:41 And where does my money go? Stocks... I continue to make $$$ when these companies continue to make money.
4583 2018-02-02 22:36:19 Ha! Trump took credit when stocks were up. He gets the blame now. It's not about what you think about money.
4584 2018-02-02 22:36:05 50% of Americans don't care. 
They have NO stocks! 
Shocking. Now, about that windfall we were all getting... 
4585 2018-02-02 22:35:52 Oh look, stocks are down. Must be Hillary’s fault.
4586 2018-02-02 22:35:39 Look what happened to stocks today. If stock market continues on this path, $5k to $100k is pretty simple for Bitcoin
4587 2018-02-02 22:35:08 Because everyone else is saying. Stocks down 666 points the Friday after Trump's first SOTU....and here Republicans kept telling us that Obama was the anti-christ all along. *tsk tsk tsk* lol

4591 2018-02-02 22:34:39 U.S. stocks have ended their worst week since February 2016, as investors worried about rising interest rates after a long market boom.
4592 2018-02-02 22:34:31 In order to provide balance, I think Blowster has a point - I have noted that DH is impervious to stating the obvious when it comes to stocks in which those he knows are invested - but, it matters not, since, in the end, everything reverts to value and shits stocks are just that.

4594 2018-02-02 22:34:06 Looks like @realDonaldTrump had another plan to make his cronies rich.  Slash taxes and boost wages to force inflation up, leading to a recession. Short Sell stocks.  #DowJones #BlackFriday. Thoughts?

4606 2018-02-02 22:31:46 " bragged about soaring stocks for months" ? the market reached historical steady gains under Trump and the first dip after over a year as  Yellen leaves her post & the Chair changes hands you jump right in with your 99% negative reporting of biased attacks on Trump
4607 2018-02-02 22:31:43 Thanks for the update much appreciated. Could I suggest that the stocks on Pillory Street are used to administer some form of punishment for the guilty.

4609 2018-02-02 22:31:40 You still are showing you don’t. Stocks in large went up b/c up deregulations and the promise of tax reform. It’s pretty basic stuff.
4610 2018-02-02 22:31:33 Id love for it to come down to 200!! So I can buy more. Yes for day trading you are probably right.There is better stocks to move in and out of. But Nvidia is the future. Nvidia is skynet. #AI #Terminator #Skynet #PileTheMoneyIn #100BillionDollarCompany

4615 2018-02-02 22:30:11 Very much so  question is how it plays out from here...my guess is energy stocks will catch up with wti by outperforming during an oil pullback
4616 2018-02-02 22:29:41 The economy starts to crash. We are laughing stocks of the world. Putin’s laughing and were in a constitutional crisis.  seriously up yours GOP you own this.
4617 2018-02-02 22:29:33 That s funny? Do you realize how many people have stocks and 401k? The fact You think a dip is a good thing is ridiculous
4618 2018-02-02 22:29:25 Sell stocks?

4622 2018-02-02 22:27:49 1) Long term holding #hodling strategy is the functional equivalent to a #portfolio candle that doesn't close.  

As long as the security is not sold,  and profit loss is not realized, the candle stays open and fluctuates.

4623 2018-02-02 22:27:44 When did I disagree that stocks had dropped today? That was rather expected, considering. I was commenting on your attitude about it, not the dropping. Not worried. Get back to me next week.

4630 2018-02-02 22:25:55 It seems paradoxical but the better the economy does, the less attractive stocks are likely to be in the short-med run.
4631 2018-02-02 22:25:23 #StockMarket. It will be either the #Democrats, Hillary or #Obama’s fault, if #45 decides to even remark.  I’ve been hearing the experts say for months that many stocks are overvalued and a correction was coming
4632 2018-02-02 22:25:07 @DeadlineWH @realDonaldTrump 
How are "your" stocks doing now Donald????
4633 2018-02-02 22:25:06 Stocks are on sale! Or the entire FBI and DOJ cashed in their retirements today to pay for legal fees...

4639 2018-02-02 22:23:20 US stocks sharply down and the $VIX up 28.51% to 17.31
4640 2018-02-02 22:23:17 @preeti_varathan It’s simple. If rates shoot up then bonds become attractive, and stocks fall as people move a higher -% to bonds.
4641 2018-02-02 22:23:03 Interesting how stocks predicts the Anti Christ that sits in the WH
4642 2018-02-02 22:22:31 @BenedictEvans opines, the future of Mobility, as it moves towards autonomy, will mean more money could get invested in alcohol companies (more time for recreation?) and shorting tobacco stocks (since most nicotine is presently sold at gas stations!) #BNEFSummit
4643 2018-02-02 22:22:20 You do realize the economy is doing very well, right? The reason the Dow is going down is in response to this, as millionaires are selling stocks due to higher interest rates that come as a response to higher wages among the middle class.

4648 2018-02-02 22:21:07 BREAKING: Dow falls more than 530 points as sell-off continues; likely to be worst week for stocks in 2 years.....@realDonaldTrump why are you silent on this???
4649 2018-02-02 22:21:02 No they use it to buy back their own stocks, which is what we're seeing. Lowering the corporate tax rate was just handing them money and hoping they do the right thing, we could've given them conditional tax breaks for raising wages and creating jobs.
4650 2018-02-02 22:20:56 el stocks de Lebacs asciende a más de $ 1.2 billones.Un 122.53% de la base monetaria. La mejor banda de fascinerosos de los ultimos 50 años
4651 2018-02-02 22:20:31 You are absolutely correct. A large drop in any indicator is not good - if you own stocks/bonds that indicator tracks. It's GREAT if you shorted those stocks yesterday.
4652 2018-02-02 22:20:17 And many owned stocks that went from $98 to $95, or $30 to $28.  I'm always careful about comparing individual stock movements to that of an index or a typical growth mutual fund.
4653 2018-02-02 22:19:35 But it is exactly why I’ve been selling stocks and buying bonds for past year or so.  No worries.  
4654 2018-02-02 22:19:28 So let me get this right, the stock market is highest decline in two years because wages are SLOWLY going up? Oh that’s right only rich people can afford to buy stocks. Yes be scared the 2.8% bump in wages will drain your all’s wallets.
4655 2018-02-02 22:19:19 Will @realDonaldTrump take credit for the too ?

They are just making up their own correlations now.

4682 2018-02-02 22:11:29 Excuse me while I reprice these stocks
4683 2018-02-02 22:11:28 Another point - the Dow is an arbitrary selection of mostly "blue chip" stocks. It's also a trademarked property of Rupert Murdoch. He bought it.
Use the S&P number of you want a more meaningful market based indicator of overall economic health & performance.
4684 2018-02-02 22:11:24 Not a good Friday for the #markets. The #Dow plunges 696 points at its low point. Ends down 666 at 25,520 or 2.5%, capping worst week in 2 years. #stocks #money #economy

4689 2018-02-02 22:10:31 In Cryptocurrencies - If you know anything about value in stocks, assets and commodities..... if there is `panic selling` then slow downward gradients are not `panic selling`!!!

4690 2018-02-02 22:09:34 NYT: "U.S. stocks ended their worst week in two years, as investors worried about rising interest rates.

4694 2018-02-02 22:07:42 Stocks are up (great 4 the wealthy invested), some people are getting marginal tax breaks (should be WAY more, and just enough for the emotional bump without truly making a difference), others are getting $1K bonuses (after years underpaid).

What a scam. Like poisoned candy.
4695 2018-02-02 22:07:41 @realDonaldTrump stocks down trump, as u so easily take credit when its up, I am assuming this is ur fault as well?

4704 2018-02-02 22:06:14 I know what you are saying but that isn’t how it works. A year into the presidency and he is NOW affecting change. The uptick he claimed was from the former admin. With passing his tax cut legislation, interest rates are NOW rising and stocks will tumble until they stabilize.
4705 2018-02-02 22:06:04 Not for nothing but if you havent observed every market tanking whether its crypto stocks or forex...You are shit at observing. Fix it. Recognize the weakness.
4706 2018-02-02 22:05:54 Bio investors are comfortable w/volatility in a way that generalists aren't. Its a more 'real' market in that sense.

4707 2018-02-02 22:05:34 Stocks dropped by this amount today $666  
Hmmmm omen for the future
4708 2018-02-02 22:04:53 Everything's on sale yes. But no money left to buy the deals until my current stocks give me some profits. Waiting.........
4709 2018-02-02 22:04:47 Every Republican president crashes the market. How are all those 1,000 stocks ppl got last week??
4710 2018-02-02 22:04:42 @realDonaldTrump We know you like to take credit for all that you've accomplished so don't forget to take credit for:
Dow plunges 665 points as stocks post worst week in 2 years
4711 2018-02-02 22:04:37 Wage growth = falling stocks HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4712 2018-02-02 22:04:31 If he.wants to keep stocks up and have bragging rights, he needs to stop destabilizing the earth.
4713 2018-02-02 22:04:25 Just met with my financial advisor...she wasn't setting off alarms bells but she is moving my money away from stocks to more stable equity. Always had my $$ in low risk...just parking it lower (aka safer).
4714 2018-02-02 22:04:19 I don't really see how a "head-in-the-sand strategy" is vaguely possible. You don't need to check your 401K to know that if you have a 401K you lost a bunch of money. And there's no way of being a human in the world without knowing that stocks tanked today.
4715 2018-02-02 22:04:08 Stocks plunge. Thanks, Groundhog.
4716 2018-02-02 22:03:38 Stocks are crashing. . .
4717 2018-02-02 22:03:18 Since @realDonaldTrump wanted to take credit for my stocks going up this whole past year, would he now like to take credit for them tanking? #StockMarketDOWN
4718 2018-02-02 22:02:58 US stocks suffer biggest daily loss of Trump era...
4719 2018-02-02 22:02:51 Well yes, today was a reminder that stocks can drop 2.5% in a day. Not for the weak
4720 2018-02-02 22:02:39 Worst day since Bush was in office. Stocks got slammed, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 666 points.
4721 2018-02-02 22:02:30 @AP @Reuters "Fat Cat" DEMS selling off stocks to distract from disastrous INTL MEMO. Yo, DEMs, your "shorts" are showing & they are ugly!
4722 2018-02-02 22:02:28 Stocks plummet todayinn worst week in 2 years while Rs play politics.  Bubble is bursting. #StockMarket #NunesMemo
4723 2018-02-02 22:01:44 No we know when to buy, you have no idea how it works. Can’t buy stocks with food stamps
4724 2018-02-02 22:01:13 You know a lot. What about a book for stocks? Or even a site. I need to invest.
4725 2018-02-02 22:00:47 Very true. Wish I had more cash to buy some stocks.
4726 2018-02-02 22:00:41 Great week for Stocks!

You're Welcome!
#PresidentBoneSpurs
4727 2018-02-02 22:00:36 and yet for some reason the stock went up .28 cents U.S. or 8% today. given how pot stocks have been for the last week, that seems strange. #TheResistance

4729 2018-02-02 22:00:23 have had a few chats about this... most stocks could drop 50-100% and people who invested a while ago would still be ahead
4730 2018-02-02 22:00:07 We definitely can't put our heads in the sand. As a Canadian I entered the space knowing we'd be taxed because the roaches miss nothing. That is why our govt welcomes crypto. There will certainly be some shock and corrections but like stocks being taxed, taxes won't kill crypto.
4731 2018-02-02 22:00:03 ruins of the forest; the bosom of the Stocks His money in a gently beaming fire Then sang the Daughters
4732 2018-02-02 21:59:47 i agree. i think we are in massive voltaility area with downtrending stock market. i still remember 1820 $spy plunge. now $spy is at 2800 a full 1000 points!. $amzn was 1068 a few weeks back and nearly 500 pts at 1500 today. market has topped on several stocks for several years
4733 2018-02-02 21:59:41 H O D L now extended to cover stock market investors. Just H O D L . Stocks have their own Satoshi called Buffett, he invented the StockChain. He will be probably buying everything cheap next week.. $SPX H O D L (not investment advice, just joking of course)
4734 2018-02-02 21:59:31 What goes up must come down...maybe more stocks get into a buying range
4735 2018-02-02 21:59:20 Stocks are just correcting after they went up too fast to 26k for the past few years due to low interest rates...  but what worries me is DEBT among consumers.
4736 2018-02-02 21:59:03 Trump's fault.  Dictatorship tends to have an effect on stocks and shares.  Makes the market jittery.
4737 2018-02-02 21:58:57 Biggest move down in stocks in 8 years and #Elliottwave Intenational writes one lousy paragraph in their update, doesn't even mention the #SP500 . OMG! If you knwo someone who does Elliott better, pelase let me know. @RobertPrechter @stevehochberg
4738 2018-02-02 21:58:38 I guess this is what happens when we have a (former) CDC Director who would rather invest in tobacco company stocks than actually work on controlling diseases ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4739 2018-02-02 21:58:33 Putin’s peeps are sellong off stocks in protest!
4740 2018-02-02 21:58:33 When I compare my crypto portfolio vs my stocks portfolio those days, I'm wondering which one of Amazon or Bitcoin looks the more parabolic now
4741 2018-02-02 21:58:25 Bitcoin isn't an investment - it's a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  ICOs can be considered 'investments'. These will eventually challenge stocks.

4743 2018-02-02 21:58:19 Thankfully, we got out of stocks many years ago.  Of course, Donald tweets zero during the fall, which shouldn't be a surprise.
4744 2018-02-02 21:58:17 Well, our national director of the Centers of Disease Control just had to resign because she was spending her time trading tobacco stocks. MAGA!
4745 2018-02-02 21:57:47 What's going on now just isn't sustainable.  Overvalued stocks, rising deficits, 9th year of GDP expansion.
4746 2018-02-02 21:57:31 The stocks just took a 600 pt nosedive.
4747 2018-02-02 21:57:06 Why does every headline refer to "the Dow"? The Dow is a meaningless average price of 30 arbitrarily selected stocks representing nothing. Pure financial pornography by the media because "#DowJones down 667 points" sounds so much scarier than "#SP500 down 2%".
4748 2018-02-02 21:56:57 Man Canadian weed stocks are getting slaughtered today
4749 2018-02-02 21:56:50 It's not just F1 that's in this game,
Stocks and speedway are just the same;
You have to look at the reason why,
You never see a traffic light guy;
So to answer the question,
And in this I'm not kidding;
The answer is this,
it objectifies women.
4750 2018-02-02 21:56:36 Not yet. You'll know when it's capitulation time when you start seeing cheap GPUs flood the market, and AMD/NVIDIA stocks tank.
4751 2018-02-02 21:55:49 Stocks fall. Flu rises. The week ahead might be intense.
4752 2018-02-02 21:55:49 I shouldn’t have sold my stocks 
4753 2018-02-02 21:54:55 Most CA MJ's still have some downside to deal with on daily chart. It likely won't be spared. But once lows are in there, it is one of my favorite "F" stocks for next Canadian leg. cc/ @MJackson3258 is already in this as of today near lows.
4754 2018-02-02 21:54:53 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-01, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):

4756 2018-02-02 21:54:46 What ever scotch she favors.  We should buy some stocks in it.  Im sure she pouring down her throat today and all weekend long
4757 2018-02-02 21:54:36 Really does not matter. All about time: Stocks go up over time, don’t try to time the market.
4758 2018-02-02 21:54:24 @realDonaldTrump stocks are down are you taking credit for that like you take credit when their up and everything else?
4759 2018-02-02 21:54:22 Gee, never thought I’d cheer for the market to go down! I’d gladly have my stocks plummet, if it means DEMS would ‘take the house’ in the Mid-terms! 
4760 2018-02-02 21:54:18 Maaaaan, my stocks are hurting bad!
4761 2018-02-02 21:54:08 Crashing, hahahaha..  dude calm down   It's over 25k  still highest in history.  Who are you HENNY PENNY?  Economists from both sides just explained. Of course CNN never admitted how great the market was doing so of course they will cry the end is here.  Do you even own stocks?
4762 2018-02-02 21:53:49 Stocks tumbled 666 points today.  And 400 the other day.  Hmm.  Unemployment continues to fall 8 years in a row -- thank you President Obama -- and the tax cuts are going directly in stock buy back (big surprise) while big layoffs announced by major corps. like Macys and Walmart.
4763 2018-02-02 21:53:42 Stocks aree not falling because minimum wage hike !!!! 
Stocks are falling because of uncertian investment into bonuses. Pensions. Health plan by corp.
Create less balance on corp books 
Witch cause uncertainty in markets
4764 2018-02-02 21:53:38 no no Fridays an unlucky day first I put on coldcream first make it fall. Often when he looses hose on hers; stocks dry puder for the
4765 2018-02-02 21:53:35 Apparently the DOW has dropped 666 points today. I don't understand stocks well enough to know what that actually means, but if this were a movie, I'd say this apocalypse plot was a little ham-handed.
4766 2018-02-02 21:53:13 cnn headlines:

Stocks crash today

Reason?

Trump is a racist
#MemoDay
4767 2018-02-02 21:53:13 Ok this trump response tweet is easy to predict. He'll blame the awful witch hunt Mueller investigation. Call it off and, voila, stocks rise again!
4768 2018-02-02 21:53:06 That wall of cash has to go somewhere. Why leave it in stocks when BTFD doesn't work? And crypto just got nice and cheap. Plus I assumed the banks would walk the price down once Futures were trading. You don't get much of a bonus at Goldman for buying BTC @ 20k
4769 2018-02-02 21:52:45 Important to note that there are way more natural buyers of bonds at lower prices (higher yields) than there are buyers of stocks at lower prices. $SPY $TNX
4770 2018-02-02 21:52:37 Fake stocks.
4771 2018-02-02 21:52:32 I pulled my money from stocks. It’s way to volatile right now.
4772 2018-02-02 21:52:12 You need to go check your stocks then come back & tell us how good your are 
4773 2018-02-02 21:52:11 More than half own stocks directly or indirectly.
4774 2018-02-02 21:51:57 stocks rose until they fell.  Gartman was bang on
4775 2018-02-02 21:51:29 I think it's a disgrace what @realDonaldTrump is doing to our country. A lot of people in the White House and in Congress, including conspirators and traitors @SpeakerRyan and @DevinNunes, should be ashamed of themselves. They should be put in stocks and tarred and feathered!

4778 2018-02-02 21:51:21 Dow drops 666 points today. Bad week for stocks,  but to be fair and consistent 50% of Americans don't own stocks. 

And no he's not the Biblical beast; he's just a lousy fraud.  The 666 point drop is merely a coincidence.
4779 2018-02-02 21:51:03 I told you, yields will rise and stocks will fall.
4780 2018-02-02 21:51:01 Corrections always happen regardless of what the news says. There are some overvalued stocks that took a hit but this dip is no indicator of future growth/decline. If that were the case I’d be a millionaire pretty quickly.
4781 2018-02-02 21:50:58 Your view tells whether it was a rough one or a good one. All stocks need to consolidate at some point. Days like today offer up cheap shares and excellent opportunities to load up current positions or open new ones. Have a great weekend everyone! Have fun, don't drink and drive!
4782 2018-02-02 21:50:49 The top five stocks that fell today were $FCX, $FBHS, $CLX, $AMD, and $CBS.
4783 2018-02-02 21:50:23 What do you think of our handlers' socks? Wooden stocks?  Numbered locks? Who do you think is a slutty fox? What do you think of the...CONGA!
4784 2018-02-02 21:50:23 Recent rises in wages, growth increase risk of inflation increases risk of more interest rate hikes increases shift to bonds increase lower desirability of stocks after such a run up.
4785 2018-02-02 21:50:19 AP Breaking News: "Stocks end sharply lower, extending a week long slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points." Third worse point drop ever. Taking credit for that too?
4786 2018-02-02 21:50:05 $pirs  Amazing how people people now use $PIRS as the benchmark of greatness for their "lesser" stocks/cos. .........and we've yet to really kick into gear.
4787 2018-02-02 21:49:59 What??? I could swear @realDonaldTrump was just bragging about how his awesome policies were making the stock market great again. I own stock via my 401k and direct stocks so WTF @realDonaldTrump?  When are you going to take credit for the WORST in 2 YRS???
4788 2018-02-02 21:49:50 Nothing but people who are about to be implicated in this MEMO scheme selling off their stocks to run away like little girls before the pitchforks and torches come for them...
4789 2018-02-02 21:49:44 I feel a tweet coming on... “you’re welcome, America. Because of me, stocks are now more affordable for American workers...”
4790 2018-02-02 21:49:19 @realDonaldTrump This is what happens when U throw the FBI & DOJ under the bus by releasing the memo!  It undermines the work of these institutions! BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points. 
4791 2018-02-02 21:49:07 And if this is true, why isn’t Trump imposing the Russian sanctions? Also stocks are starting to fault. Keep the Trump  propaganda going, but in the end Trump’s money laundering and his possible acts of treason will be revealed.
4792 2018-02-02 21:49:02 Yep, all of the business who benefitted from Trump's tax breaks are just selling off company stocks, then buying them back fo an attempted profit for the shareholders & CEOs.  Apparently though everyone doing it simultaneously doesnt help the Dow Jones Ind average. lol smh
4793 2018-02-02 21:49:02 Stocks plummet.Steepest point decline in the #Dow since the 2008 crisis: 666 points down. Will evangelical trumpers head the prophecy? #antichrist
4794 2018-02-02 21:49:00 => Under the current administration, the SEC will never be allowed to halt trading.  Trump doesn't invest in stocks.  He may lose a little popularity at Mar a Largo, though.
4795 2018-02-02 21:48:49 Nonsense. Germany stocks fell YESTERDAY. And bitcoin fell days earlier.
4796 2018-02-02 21:48:44 Why buy stocks when u could buy socks

4798 2018-02-02 21:48:27 Wow...first Afro American unemployment numbers went up and Stocks dropped big time...wonder what President Trump has to say about that
4799 2018-02-02 21:48:25 This often happens when central banks begin tightening monetary policy. The more tightening that occurs this year, the more downward pressure it places on stocks – so we’ll be closely following all measures of inflation. (3 of 3)
4800 2018-02-02 21:48:13 Stocks drop, let's see how #POTUS blames someone else for that
4801 2018-02-02 21:48:09 Never sold my good stocks in any down market for over 40 yrs.  Buy good stocks and hold them. #Appreciation & #Dividends working for me.
4802 2018-02-02 21:47:57 One of the greatest risks to the stock market this year is tighter-than-expected monetary policy. Signs of inflation could spook the FOMC, and higher inflation is starting to be priced into markets, causing a re-rating of stocks–as we’re seeing with today’s stock market. (2 of 3)
4803 2018-02-02 21:47:50 fake news ....according to trump, stocks soared up 600 points today!
4804 2018-02-02 21:47:49 Stocks down as various dumbass brokers face margin calls on their Bitcoin portfolios
4805 2018-02-02 21:47:44 Oh no! The economy is doing better than expected. Sell your stocks!
4806 2018-02-02 21:47:42 He’ll claim that he’s making stocks more affordable for working people...
4807 2018-02-02 21:47:40 My thought is: burn your money. A list of stocks is not a fucking actionable investment plan, it's a shopping list.
4808 2018-02-02 21:47:33 The top five stocks that gained today were $MAT, $MSI, $CHTR, $XL, and $EW.
4809 2018-02-02 21:47:17 I need like a financial counselor. Like somebody to help me build credit, file my taxes CORRECTLY, invest in stocks & bonds. Stuff like that.

4812 2018-02-02 21:46:48 Stocks are on sale.
4813 2018-02-02 21:46:31 The top five most active stocks today were $BAC, $AAPL, $GE, $AMD, and $F.
4814 2018-02-02 21:46:29 A few stocks/etfs I’ll be looking at next week - $NVDA, $BA, $DIS, $IWM, $FFIV, $GS, $TSLA, $QQQ. I’d consider a short of $IWM $QQQ if next bounce is weak. I don’t expect a “V-shaped” rally. Volatility is back and we should be salivating like Nancy Pelosi at a Botox Museum
4815 2018-02-02 21:46:23 During the $SPY CHOP overextended stocks can give back weeks of gains in a matter of days.  There are dozens doing so right now.

4817 2018-02-02 21:46:16 LOL...Joe pulls headline out of his ass. Market pulled back because we no longer living under Obama's slow growth economy. In fact economy so hot they have to raise interest rates. That's why stocks retreat....buy dips.
4818 2018-02-02 21:46:07 No,@realDonaldTrump just wanted to take the credit when the stocks were up Chris.
4819 2018-02-02 21:45:48 While I am sure it is not due to his high intellectual acumen he is correct that it does need to come down as instead of hiring or creating jobs people companies are buying stocks
4820 2018-02-02 21:45:45 And we'll get crickets from @realDonaldTrump about #Stocks plummeting. He pounds his chest, taking false credit for the highs. Oh, but the lows? Damn you, #Obama! SMH  #TrumpResign #ShitholePresident #Resist #FBR
4821 2018-02-02 21:45:38 Hey Donnie Dotard, how's about those stocks hmmmm??? LOSER!
4822 2018-02-02 21:45:19 When you invest in stocks, you are investing in a company that was required by law to file a "fictional name statement".   Do you see the lunacy of your statement?
4823 2018-02-02 21:45:12 Oh I thought that was Nexon's stocks.

wait.
4824 2018-02-02 21:45:10 How about you report on the current crash that's going on with stocks rather than even more FUD for crypto? Lol.
4825 2018-02-02 21:45:02 So good news means bad news?  I'm confused.  #Stocks fell sharply Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.
4826 2018-02-02 21:44:55 The market doesn’t like memo scandal, higher wages, risk of hyper economy, bubble in bonds, then stocks. #FederalReserve. Not Trumps fault.
4827 2018-02-02 21:44:51 I try to hedge in every corner to get saved if shit hits the fan in one area. but crypto is indeed more fun for traders. stocks are pretty boring
4828 2018-02-02 21:44:40 I thought you meant assets like stocks. Robinhood does stocks with free commissions and is testing adding cryptos with free commissions. If you want other crypto assets, I use Bittrex and Binance. Coinbase to onboard USD.
4829 2018-02-02 21:44:28 “There’s a lot of investors that got in in the last month and many of them are looking at significant losses,” PI Financial analyst Jason Zandberg said by telephone. “It now looks like it’s a pile-on. There’s a bit of panic selling.” #business #trading #stocks #market #tsx #money
4830 2018-02-02 21:44:26 Just think of all the sweet sweet stocks you'll be buying when it's at discount. :)
4831 2018-02-02 21:44:25 Good. Can we also display the idiot whose decision this was? Outside the gallery? In stocks?
4832 2018-02-02 21:44:12 the market does hate uncertainty & instability...

"Art Cashin, the director of floor operations at UBS, said the release of the much-anticipated memo from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on the Russia probe remained in the background as stocks sold off Friday."
4833 2018-02-02 21:43:51 Nothing new in my paycheck. I’ve lost $400 in stocks the past few days. The market is tanking and my 401k is going in reverse. Thanks #MAGA!
4834 2018-02-02 21:43:44 @LouDobbs WOW! First "Fat Cat" DEMs try to kill 220 Republicans in a train wreck and now selling off stocks to cover disastrous INTEL MEMO!

4838 2018-02-02 21:43:35 ..700 cr in concentrated portfolio of just 15 small cap stocks??
= 50 cr per stock..

4839 2018-02-02 21:43:34 In short, the #dowjones is dropping because the upper income owners of these stocks no longer have confidence in the ability of @realDonaldTrump to deliver the #corrupt promises he made to them. Pulling out of “betting big” on Trump futures.
4840 2018-02-02 21:43:23 Bumble head you need to go to bed-- the market rises & recedes daily, it's the trend line that tells the story and a favorable administration causes a rising trend. Whether they own stocks or not-Nearly everyone benefits from stocks in one way or the other-you know, trickle down!
4841 2018-02-02 21:43:08 More monopolies would mean higher stocks but a worse economy.

Lowering tax rate raises stocks without really changing the business, just pays the stocks owners more and gov less. Ditto on reverse change.

So seems like a poor proxy unless lots of others things are held constant.
4842 2018-02-02 21:43:05 As if stocks aren't risky enough.
4843 2018-02-02 21:42:55 Donald Trump just like you told everyone to buy stocks there falling so fast  so why dont you push that button  and just kill everyone cause Red China Russia Germany N Korea will demolish the world and when you push that button you can also kiss your ass god bye
4844 2018-02-02 21:42:47 Deficit/debt issues are major concerns, I've said that before. But pretending they've only been an issue recently is to ignore history. Bigger point is that despite bad day for stocks, the longer term situation is more stable. That's a good thing.
4845 2018-02-02 21:42:43 It's called an adjustment.  Stocks are still way higher than a year ago.  Take a deep breath, sit back and relax.
4846 2018-02-02 21:42:40 When should u lever up long stocks? When @CNBC runs the “market in turmoil” signs and specials
4847 2018-02-02 21:42:28 Look theres no such thing as BONE BROTH. Its nothing new, Its just stocks, buillion or broth, ppl have consumed it forever. Its not a mirac;le food!
4848 2018-02-02 21:42:28 If we could get that, that would be awesome. Lots of oil, commodity, and gold stocks to buy!!!!!!
4849 2018-02-02 21:42:26 Am I the only one who uses the stocks app on my phone
4850 2018-02-02 21:42:22 Stocks fell by 500 points.

But those tax breaks tho AMIRITE!?!?!?
4851 2018-02-02 21:42:14 The hard part is knowing what's the right price, esp because many stocks have soared. Where does it all settle out? I've heard it compared to the Internet stocks of the 90s. But if you believe in the industry and have $$ to spend then it could be a fine investment.
4852 2018-02-02 21:42:04 I'm buying 200 of my favorite stocks on Monday so I can crush the shorts
4853 2018-02-02 21:42:00 HEY DOTARD, THE DOW JUST DROPPED 665 POINTS! STOCKS POST THE WORST WEEK IN TWO YEARS! WHAT A DISGUSTING MESS YOU’VE MADE!

4855 2018-02-02 21:41:10 Not very good if your fiddling with the corp tax rate though, since portion of profits to owners vs gov is changing and stocks based on only value of one side of that.
4856 2018-02-02 21:41:03 @realDonaldTrump how about those stocks now, Donny?
4857 2018-02-02 21:40:57 I'm tired of being broke with a savings that's just sitting there. I'm gonna start investing in stocks and maybe on cryptocurrency,

Also, the only reason the market exists at this high a level is because of the massive..

4865 2018-02-02 21:40:14 Dow is on track for its worst single-day decline since June 24, 2016. But…

-Dow Jones <> stock market <> economy
-20% of Americans own 90% of stocks


So this really doesn't affect most of America. And Presidents shouldn't talk about the stock market anyway.
4866 2018-02-02 21:40:03 About 4% off compared to a week ago, but stocks are still up on the year.
4867 2018-02-02 21:40:01 so you are saying that there is a reason why stocks are one of the components of almost every leading economic index....who knew?  :-)
4868 2018-02-02 21:39:43 Stocks are crashing, Bitcoin is crashing, put all your monet into Popscoin, the only revolutionary countercurrency that utilizes the popschain #gotthavesmypopg
4869 2018-02-02 21:39:33 Notice the scam last month when it was increasing to fast in one day, getting all kinds of people to invest in the market money went into market in inflate the cost of stocks once you made your money back plus profits you pull out. This has been a scam for several yrs now. 3/3
4870 2018-02-02 21:39:30 Best stocks on my watchlist today are the so far very few gold stocks. Closed +/- 0 or with very moderate loses.
4871 2018-02-02 21:39:19 Stocks on sale!
4872 2018-02-02 21:39:15 Huge correlation between the overall market and weed stocks unfortunately the big growers get hit the hardest *no pun intended

4874 2018-02-02 21:39:09 @ECB's Governing Council said 1/25 they could extend QE if financial conditions become unfavorable to the inflation outlook. Will European stocks follow US stocks lower Monday? If they do, will #euro give up some of recent gains vis-a-vis the #dollar?
4875 2018-02-02 21:39:05 #DayofFacts #FactsMatter Every year the stock market goes down when People who made profits have to sell stocks to pay their taxes. Big Profits equal Big Taxes Every year the sell off starts earlier but maybe Americans file their 1040s earlier to beat the rush toward Apr 15th.

4879 2018-02-02 21:38:33 Why is it that nobody wanted to talk about stocks and what they was doing untill they drop? (was inevitable they go down, then yo yo then stablize hopfully). How many thousands of points have they rose 1st. 1 year in and you haters still full of hate. I feel sad for you.
4880 2018-02-02 21:38:23 No, no, no. Stocks are dipping because bond yields are rising, this has a little to do with politics as humanly possible. Trump gets no credit for the 6% rise to start the year and no blame for this weeks correction
4881 2018-02-02 21:38:09 One of those very rare days when all asset classes got dumped.  Nowhere to hide but cash.
Commodities have broken out long term against stocks, though.  By dumping least.

4891 2018-02-02 21:37:09 Why are stocks falling-our President cannot be trusted to serve America first.

4894 2018-02-02 21:36:58 World stocks tumble: US -2.1%; Europe -1.4%. Pick your poison: whiff of inflation; rising interest-rates; rising wages; disappointing productivity growth; political dysfunction with a potential constitutional crisis. All weigh on an expensive market & provide a reason to sell.
4895 2018-02-02 21:36:47 @BobPisani @CNBCFastMoney  i have not heard you guys mention the $DAX selling off first, before US stocks, which was triggered by the move in Bund yields.  Would love it in the future if you guys looked at what is going on around that globe... not just in the US
4896 2018-02-02 21:36:38 Hmmm, well, usually I try not to rush in when the match starts, stick close to your teammates at first. Also watch out for your teammates, if any of them are being pressured or double-teamed etc, go help because your teams stocks can fall really quickly if that's constsntly
4897 2018-02-02 21:36:27 All we had to do was be corrupt remove regulations that protect consumers and the environment collude with Russia have I missed anything? Guess it's worth it right. Most Americans don't have stocks especially after the recession but yay stock market the rich got richer
4898 2018-02-02 21:36:17 Also stocks in US are way over valued at the moment and this could easily be the beginning of a bubble bursting.

4900 2018-02-02 21:36:01 I wonder who else i know that actually invest in stocks 
4901 2018-02-02 21:35:37 It will be the end of twitter.
Sell your stocks now
4902 2018-02-02 21:35:15 It's not public. But when it lists, investors will have to decide if a company with no profit is worth buying. With pot, there are issues u don't find in other sectors. It'll get worked out and cos will do well. But until then, hard 2 know what the value of these stocks should be
4903 2018-02-02 21:35:02 We just had the strongest Jan. for stocks since 1987 and the weakest Jan. for the dollar since 1987.  Interest rates are rising now for the same reasons they rose then, widening budget and trade deficits.  Given the complacency,  I wonder if this time Black Monday arrives in Feb?
4904 2018-02-02 21:34:51 Hoy fué un blood bath en el market. Día de shorts las stocks.
4905 2018-02-02 21:34:48 Didn't you hear? Good stocks are thanks to Trump, bad ones are Democrats' fault.

4908 2018-02-02 21:34:43 Oversold is a term used to describe equity stocks who’s value can be directly compared to company financials and fundamental value, which does not apply in any way here.
4909 2018-02-02 21:34:42 So what happened to ur vaulted Dow Jones, Moron? It TANKED b/c u released that  memo & injected uncertainty in2 the gov. Ppl have turned 2 bonds, precious metals, CASH, safer havens than stocks b/c of YOU! U DARE 2 tamper w Rosenstein & there'll B  ppl rioting in streets.
4910 2018-02-02 21:34:27 nice WE! be calm. panic is a bad advisor ( VIX ). use short calls to get a small protection. gain cash to buy some deep pressured stocks ( selling surprise is over )and sell some highflyer ( if a real selling panic comes ..). Up to now: we´re in a corr. modus - not a crash.

4918 2018-02-02 21:33:39 Must have sold stocks to buy BTC dip...
4919 2018-02-02 21:33:34 Not a trumpet, nor a trump supporter,  but it has to do with Fed raising interest rates. Earnings in general good, jobs growth good etc, so now the interest rates are rising and money managers move out of stocks and get into 100% U.S. gov backed Treasuries to get a safer yield.
4920 2018-02-02 21:33:25 Funny how CBS didn't report about the stocks going up. But damn sure will when it down & fits the narrative! 
4921 2018-02-02 21:33:18 #StockMarket drop is simply money shifting from stocks to bonds.
4922 2018-02-02 21:33:17 Feb. 2, 2018

4932 2018-02-02 21:31:57 Stocks down 665.75 pts!
4933 2018-02-02 21:31:42 Part 1 continuation. The reason for the drop, rising wages, economic growth = the Fed tempering it with raising interest rates. Have you noticed the bond rates rising? Rates go up stocks back track some. This was a healthy breather after a massive Trump rally
4934 2018-02-02 21:31:40 Ay yoooo what's going on with the stocks? I lost $400 in 2 days!

4970 2018-02-02 21:27:41 Well, I do love Vanguard. But my stocks are at Ally right now so I have to see that site anyway. So it's more complicated - do I want to take the profit hit of selling off since I don't think I can just transfer?
4971 2018-02-02 21:27:37 Stocks are dropping faster than Shothole Donnie’s trousers with a porn star
4972 2018-02-02 21:27:27 If the stocks rise 6000 then dip 600 they are still up 5400 tho
4973 2018-02-02 21:27:10 TRUMP: Stocks are the highest they've ever been.

*Stocks plunge today*

Oops. Guess Trump & GOP didn't know about the fallout of their #TaxReform. #GOPTaxScam LOL
4974 2018-02-02 21:27:10 Wow - stocks keep tumbling.  Investors must be living DT today! Not! #SaveUSa
4975 2018-02-02 21:27:05 RISING BOND YIELDS ARE RATTLING STOCK HOLDERS
TEN YEAR YIELD REACHES FOUR-YEAR HIGH
BOND YIELDS ARE RISING FASTER THAN STOCKS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE BULL MARKET STARTED
-THE VIX INDEX SURGES TO FIFTEEN-MONTH HIGH
-- S&P 500 APPEARS HEADED FOR RESTEST OF ITS 50-DAY AVERAGE
4976 2018-02-02 21:26:59 Sellers over reacting to interest rates - historically low. Rates are going up & will continue to. Its a good thing because it shows real growth in the economy. Stocks are still the best investment around. Will they freak when new chair raises rates? Go Eagles!

Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
4978 2018-02-02 21:26:41 Stocks had a pretty bad day
4979 2018-02-02 21:26:38 Gold, bonds, stocks all lower. No where to run. Oh and bitcoin too
4980 2018-02-02 21:26:33 @realDenaldTrump my stocks took a little bit of a hit today. Is this still your economy or do we blame Obama now?
4981 2018-02-02 21:26:30 @realDonaldTrump BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
4982 2018-02-02 21:26:29 Finally some real action in stocks. SandP down over 2%. Let’s see if we can get to down 5-10%. A real correction is a necessary part of a healthy bull market. We’ve been in an unreal time. Now some reality.
4983 2018-02-02 21:26:23 Sooo this is what happened today, because the market loves uncertainty (not) so everyone wants to be in cash!! Instead of in a country which may be on the brink of a governmental collapse!#StockMarket #TrumpStockCrash #stocks #markets #futures #dowjones #commodities #inflation
4984 2018-02-02 21:26:16 Bought extra shares of my stocks.
4985 2018-02-02 21:26:14 Will they be pissed when the stocks crash? Lose money, have to delay retirement (work at Walmart part time to make ends meet) then they will be cut from medicaid and SS. Who will they blame then? Dems?
4986 2018-02-02 21:26:03 I have been considering migrating some of my stocks to crypto, stock market is full of red flags while crypto is at a discount
4987 2018-02-02 21:25:58 Obama and Hillary did it!! I don’t own stocks so I don’t care. I just feel bad for the working people who have pensions tied to it.
4988 2018-02-02 21:25:53 Dow stocks had its worst day since #Brexit. Points dropped more than 600,worst since you took office.I hope you will take ownership over this just as you bragged about soaring market prices when things were going your way. Although it wasnt your credit to take. @realDonaldTrump

4992 2018-02-02 21:25:14 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-01, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
4993 2018-02-02 21:25:13 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-01, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
4994 2018-02-02 21:25:00 Don't worry! If 10% of the people own 80% of the stocks this Dow slide impacts the life of 0% of Americans.
4995 2018-02-02 21:24:37 BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points. Via @AP
4996 2018-02-02 21:24:29 @realDonaldTrump thanks a lot asshole, stocks drop and my investments plunge bc you can't see past your own face, if you did nothing wrong with Russia, put your big boy pants on and talk to Mueller....I'll even buy you a baby rattle.
4997 2018-02-02 21:24:29 Might want to take a look at the Dow if you have your money invested in stocks. 680 plunge  after Trump pulled the farce release the memo. You backed a good one there.
4998 2018-02-02 21:24:21 Just ironic that every time something political happens lately, the stocks shift.
4999 2018-02-02 21:23:58 If you're personally upset by what happened with stocks today, feel free to go scream at the dumbass Democrats and crooks like Comey for hurting your portfolio. This is 100% on them.
5000 2018-02-02 21:23:56 Ugleee! What a mess. Good news is now bad . Strong employment drives rates and stocks tank. Humpty Dumpty is in the drivers seat. All red and all down over 2%. Breadth indicative: 1 to 9 and 1 to 10. 1 to 10 or 10 to 1 often signals a turn.
5001 2018-02-02 21:23:51 Make no mistake, stocks plummet today because of the FISA Memo release. And is Comey concerned he used the government to intimidate voters and to sway an election in Dem favor? NOPE! NADA! And that idiot says, 'oh it,s nothing, move along!'
5002 2018-02-02 21:23:45 The #DJIA fell 666 points today. Really? 666? 
#markets #crash #stocks #StockMarket
5003 2018-02-02 21:23:39 Stocks sell-off hmmm.  Thanks Obama for the great economy but rethuglicans are now in charge and it is heading south.
5004 2018-02-02 21:23:36 I usually always turn the channel when Shepard comes on but I watched today. He was disgusting when he was gloating about the stocks dropping.
5005 2018-02-02 21:23:25 “Respectfully,[ATF]has no constitutional or statutory authority to define bump stocks as a machine gun,”wrote Gregory Beaves, a Texas peace officer with 20 years of experience.“If ATF acts to attempt to define bump stocks as machine guns,it will be acting outside  its authority.”
5006 2018-02-02 21:23:20 Stocks reacting to our corrupt government
5007 2018-02-02 21:23:11 All #democrats should sell their stocks.  The replacement of #JanetYellen might be raising interest rates so we may have something else to invest in finally.
5008 2018-02-02 21:23:04 I warned many, people did not listen. Dow Jones Took a hit. It's lower than it's been in years.

5009 2018-02-02 21:23:02 @realDonaldTrump Dow plunges 665 points as stocks post worst week in 2 years.  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott @MarkSanford
5010 2018-02-02 21:23:01 @LizClaman Your guy is correct. Earnings is the life blood of stocks. Business fundamentals are great. Fear of inflation drove 665 points DOW drop. What to do? What do you think Buffet is doing today? He likes blood on the streets. Have faith in the long-term growth of US equity!
5011 2018-02-02 21:23:00 So my stocks have gone down significantly. #StockMarket
5012 2018-02-02 21:23:00 My stocks dropped in value...sadly it is the only thing going down on me
5013 2018-02-02 21:22:55 Do you believe that the #MemoDay affected today's market?

5014 2018-02-02 21:22:55 @realDonaldTrump Stocks down 666 points. Whose fault, Hillary or PRESIDENT OBAMA. I’m SURE its not YOUR fault, right ?
5015 2018-02-02 21:22:41 The final Dow drop rounded off to a perfect 666

Do we have an omen?

5016 2018-02-02 21:22:00 We ALL knew this would happen. The rich people made money off stocks. Now it's coming to an end. What will happen to the stock market now...???
5017 2018-02-02 21:21:50 Stocks plummet.  Thanks @RealDonad_Trump
5018 2018-02-02 21:21:42 This is fake news. Stocks only go up.
5019 2018-02-02 21:21:40 why are stocks dropping trump  rofl
5020 2018-02-02 21:21:40 MONEY: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points
5021 2018-02-02 21:21:12 Jesus Christ, stocks go up and down.  Fucking media needs an enema.
5022 2018-02-02 21:21:05 If shitcoin continues to dump this weekend, very likely stocks will continue lower as moron hedge funds stabilize their crypto holdings.
5023 2018-02-02 21:20:57 Is anyone surprised that stocks had their worst week in years the week Devin Nunes released his completely ridiculous memo?

This is the beginning of the end for @realDonaldTrump
5024 2018-02-02 21:20:49 Via @AP: Stocks ended their worst week in two years Friday, and the Dow's drop was its biggest in percentage terms since June 2016. #economy #StockMarket
5025 2018-02-02 21:20:28 Rich people....losing some money. Big deal. Stocks is like gambling you win some you lose some. You win big you lose big. You chose to play with the risk..... blame yourself.
5026 2018-02-02 21:20:27 Of you look at all the new stocks investing, it's pretty sketchy
5027 2018-02-02 21:20:16 New jobs above expected, salaries starting to go up and naturally stocks take a dive. Why? Cause that’s how Wall Street thinks: salary increases is bad for business. Just a real example of why trickle dowm economics don’t work.
5028 2018-02-02 21:19:48 Donnie, stocks are down over 600 points. I know , Obama did it!  Oh, the memo is a dud. Pretends that the pee pee dossier was used as basis for FISA. Not yet, but dont hold your breath. Its next.
5029 2018-02-02 21:19:46 People dumping stocks to get into crypto? 
5030 2018-02-02 21:19:34 Perpetually.

I don't have any stocks, so this doesn't INITIALLY affect me... But if this continues, we'll all be feeling it.
5031 2018-02-02 21:19:15 #StockMarket drop is simply money shifting from stocks to bonds.
5032 2018-02-02 21:19:12 Dow drops over 600 points; stocks post biggest weekly percentage drop in 2 years
5033 2018-02-02 21:19:12 Dow plunges 665 points as stocks post worst week in 2 years. That's not a great start!!
5034 2018-02-02 21:19:12 I find higher priced stocks axt differrently. I'd rather master one market then try master them all but you are right i may need to widen my horizon

5040 2018-02-02 21:18:12 Yes. Such a kind man. He was truly a thinker. Slow in answering. Deep. Cuz of him, I was out of all stocks for all accounts 2 - 3 weeks before Crash of '87. Missed all of it.
5041 2018-02-02 21:18:11 This country has become a shithole under Trump & co.
No wonder stocks are taking a dive. Americans are actively planning their exit plan to go live in a civilized country.
5042 2018-02-02 21:18:11 DOW INDUSTRIALS gain 666 points. 
OH wait, NO 
The DOW  plunged 666 points.
@realDonaldTrump  
Oil stocks fail very badly amidst the turmoil.
Looking forward to hearing the earnest explanations of the 
Dow drop as being Obama's fault.
5043 2018-02-02 21:18:07 If he takes all the credit for stocks going up he should take all the credit when they go down, right? He won't though. It will be someone/something else's fault.

5047 2018-02-02 21:17:40 can y explain why you buy (accumulating) for example $JT and have 2 stocks at SRP?
Is that your private investment
5048 2018-02-02 21:17:34 Don't try to time the market. If you hold individual stocks of high quality companies (I do), you don't sell stocks of great companies just because the price fell. That's a time to think about adding to positions.
5049 2018-02-02 21:17:29 But trump said the stocks were up because of him and his awesomeness. So, if they're down does that mean....  Wait, has he blamed Obama or Hilary yet? What about Comey, there's still time to blame Comey....
5050 2018-02-02 21:17:27 Mr. Trump why is DOW and other stocks down by large amounts and trending down?
5051 2018-02-02 21:17:20 People need to realize that the stock market is not our economy. We all spend in the economy while less than half of us own stocks. Of those that do, they hold 65% by US owners while foreigner own 35%. Further 10% of US owners of stock own 84% of the 65% total (or 54.6% of total)
5052 2018-02-02 21:17:13 The Trump Dump of stocks! Nervous investors. Running from dollars
5053 2018-02-02 21:17:09 With today's drop in the US markets stocks have fallen all the way back to levels not seen since January 11, 2018.
5054 2018-02-02 21:17:07 My stocks are falling (just like I predicted they would from all this artificial inflation)! Is it a coincidence that this is happening just as the tax law changed? And how come no one is talking about our failing dollar? Sad!
5055 2018-02-02 21:17:01 Stocks are now on sale at discount. Time to buy.
5056 2018-02-02 21:16:36 Nah, just Trump and his buddies taking profits.  Average Joe is at work today, not trading stocks.
5057 2018-02-02 21:16:09 @realDonaldTrump This is what happens when U throw the FBI & DOJ under the bus by releasing the memo!  It undermines the work of these institutions! BREAKING: Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5058 2018-02-02 21:16:04 Stocks dropped 700 points. Making a Americans Not great #limpdicktrump #TraitorNunes #RESIST #FuckTrump
5059 2018-02-02 21:15:45 Who feels like we've been screaming "wolf" for the last year & no one believes it. We're screwed, even if you move your stocks & bonds to cash, the dollar value has been slipping down. Are we really going to destroy America to soothe a sick narcissists ego & protect Russian loans
5060 2018-02-02 21:15:24 Majority of Americans/the normal American, such as myself, dont own stocks, therefore not a good indicator at all
5061 2018-02-02 21:15:24 Stocks posted their worst week in two yrs today. Your fake winning is showing.
5062 2018-02-02 21:15:12 One investor's trash is another investor's treasure.  #Uranium #stocks weak due to weak #U3O8 Spot price due to very few transactions in January. May be turning as Spot rising again. RPA controls the publication of Fission RE.  Like U, would prefer they hold off a bit longer.
5063 2018-02-02 21:15:06 What's up not going to talk about how great stocks are doing today?
5064 2018-02-02 21:15:03 In case of #Trump doesn't realize this on #MemoDay stocks are falling.

They know that the FBI knows everything about everything. It's over. No one wins fighting the FBI. They know what time you poo.
5065 2018-02-02 21:14:57 Stocks bitcoin AND gold down what. who making money?
5066 2018-02-02 21:14:46 The net numbers: US stocks were down about 4% for the week (DJIA -1096). Last time we were down 1000 pts? Wk of 1/8/16. But then it was -6%, now it's only -4%.
5067 2018-02-02 21:14:45 meanwhile, Millennials ask: What are stocks?
5068 2018-02-02 21:14:42 Yup, nothing to do but be patient. Either way, our Canadian stocks have gotten hit so hard that there's not much room to go lower.

5070 2018-02-02 21:14:19 It's a perfect time to buy stocks

5072 2018-02-02 21:14:02 Lock them up?  No way!  Put them in the stocks and pass out rotten tomatoes.
5073 2018-02-02 21:13:58 What’s the correlation between crypto and stock market ? 

Stocks have been going up for years

What do you guys think happens to crypto if stock markets were to crash ?
5074 2018-02-02 21:13:51 Worst week for stocks in over 2 years despite best $SPY #earnings estimate revisions in 7 years.
5075 2018-02-02 21:13:43 Stocks close down - 666.  Hmmm
5076 2018-02-02 21:13:43 #StockMarket is crashing. Which is some what a good. Now it’s time to buy stocks for cheap. U gotta think long term with this shit.
5077 2018-02-02 21:13:42 It is clear the policies the FED and other central banks implemented have left investor with few places to hide during market sell-offs. Today gold, silver, bonds, and yen were all down together with stocks
5078 2018-02-02 21:13:29 Stocks ended a bad week with a sharp drop today. Investors appear to be skittish about rising interest rates after a long market boom. -- NYTimes
5079 2018-02-02 21:13:25 @realDonaldTrump how are your precious stocks (that you took all the credit for) doing this week? Did they say worst drop since 2008?
5080 2018-02-02 21:13:21 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5081 2018-02-02 21:12:47 (AP) - Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5082 2018-02-02 21:12:47 (AP) - Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5083 2018-02-02 21:12:45 In 11/16, I advised all to sell US stocks & shift overseas. As expected, US stocks were worst performers in global recovery. In 12/17, I advised selling & staying in cash 4 correction in 1/18. Now, I expect a dead-cat bounce, then full correction. THEN invest. But overseas again.
5084 2018-02-02 21:12:43 U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.
5085 2018-02-02 21:12:30 Walk up to any person on the street, not your fixed meetings/rallies and ask them if they got a raise or bonus in the last year, more than likely they haven't. I know I haven't. Gas prices up, Healthcare up, food prices  up. But rest assured stocks are up... for the wealthy.
5086 2018-02-02 21:12:28 Also, the real panic will be a nightmare. Especially if it hits treasuries/bonds which I suspect it will.

Remember, everyone thinks it will be stocks. It might not be.
5087 2018-02-02 21:12:27 not an economist, but I think stocks are going down because people are expecting inflation and higher interest rates precisely because the economy has been doing so well
5088 2018-02-02 21:12:23 Dow plunges 620 points as stocks head for worst week in 2 years
5089 2018-02-02 21:12:15 Stocks are going down
5090 2018-02-02 21:12:13 It's still Friday in America. Stocks down over 675 points today. Waiting for President's tweet how it was Hillary’s fault. Also waiting for secret memo from GOP house members saying stocks down due to anti-Trump employees at SEC.
5091 2018-02-02 21:11:56 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5092 2018-02-02 21:11:56 Stocks dropped 666 pts today...
5093 2018-02-02 21:11:55 Why? You can move 401k funds out of stocks. Check out what other funds are available.
5094 2018-02-02 21:11:54 An #Obama and #Clinton arrest and perp walk has to be worth 1,000 point Dow rally in stocks.. :)
5095 2018-02-02 21:11:53 No, it's just an economic shift. Today bonds are more attractive than stocks.
5096 2018-02-02 21:11:47 Drop n stocks = Worlds reaction 2 Memo #ReadTheMemo #MemoDay #MAGA
5097 2018-02-02 21:11:46 It’s not crashing. 600 points down is still hundreds of points higher then it’s been the last 8 years. As wages rise stocks go down. It will balance out again.
5098 2018-02-02 21:11:36 Watch for bounce at 50d SMA for $SPY and all stocks and then a breakdown.
5099 2018-02-02 21:11:32 Each time I have to buy Augmentin, I am reminded of @BKFUniversity gems about owning stocks in the companies you spend with most...I need a piece of Glaxo, one way or the other...
5100 2018-02-02 21:11:31 Give it a few days, then the bulls will come out..... stocks go up and down based on news. Today has been a bad day for news let it all settle and it will go up.

5104 2018-02-02 21:10:42 US stocks got smacked today: DJIA off 665, S&P500 off 60, giving back gains made since 2nd week of January.
5105 2018-02-02 21:10:35 Raising the deficit level will do this.  Once corps stop buying back their stocks the crash will come.

5110 2018-02-02 21:10:07 This is all because of you though, right? If the stocks rising is solely to your credit, then this is solely your fault. Be careful tying yourself to a capricious economic indicator.
5111 2018-02-02 21:10:05 NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points.
5112 2018-02-02 21:10:02 Shit, Trump is going to turn on Nunes, Ryan and McConnell, look at the stock plunge. "The economy, the stocks, the jobs", Trump I don't hear you. Tick tock, Trump turns of Trumpettes.
5113 2018-02-02 21:09:53 It would be a good time to reevaluate your stocks. The bubble has been building, and it will burst. What good does having more $ from "tax relief" do if prices rise? And they will rise because the dollar is weak and getting weaker. Pay attention, don't let greed get you. Prepare.
5114 2018-02-02 21:09:51 Wow! Stocks crash on “dud” memo!

5118 2018-02-02 21:09:34 Stocks had their worst week in years. I wonder when Trump will take credit for that... oh wait. He only takes credit when stocks go up.
5119 2018-02-02 21:09:30 Be interesting to see if we'll see any rotation from stocks to Bitcoin considering the current divergence in value-perceived anyway.

5123 2018-02-02 21:09:02 No we've avoided the majors throughout as there is more value down the chain; stocks not covered by the street trading at deep discounts to the big boys.  They got hit too but that's not surprising given the group-think.
5124 2018-02-02 21:08:59 I’ll be trading penny stocks from now on out of a small Long Island brokerage in a strip mall next to friendlys

5126 2018-02-02 21:08:54 Dow down 600 & falling. Those without stocks may not care or take no harm. But I wish for the middle millions who have a small slice of the pie: that the wealthy could be really hurt by this without it harming the rest of us. Of course, they'll see to it that THAT won't happen.
5127 2018-02-02 21:08:54 be the worst for the blue-chip gauge since the 6.2% weekly decline also in early January of 2016. Rising yields can undercut appetite for assets perceived as risky, including stocks. The S&P 500 index , meanwhile, was down 2%, at 2,767  #MAGA
5128 2018-02-02 21:08:37 The constitution is being walked all over by the dems and everyone who simply does not like Trump and you’re worried about the stock market? The stocks will recover but they cannot until the corruption is dealt with
5129 2018-02-02 21:08:31 @FoxNews  screen banner says "Stocks plunge amid fallout over memo alleging FBI abuses, rising interest rates". Wish I were a fly on @realdonaldtrump's wall today.
5130 2018-02-02 21:08:22 But Netflix, GoPro and Fitbit stocks were up today
5131 2018-02-02 21:08:14 Finally! Now we can get ready to buy a whole new round of stocks on sale!!! This will send the market higher.
5132 2018-02-02 21:08:08 It was only a matter of time. We are in "Trump happy time" which has nothing to do with reality. The Obama momentum will run out & Donnie's happy time bubble will burst. We're expecting inflation & Greenspan is warning about the Bond market first then stocks all w/ a  down dollar
5133 2018-02-02 21:08:06 actually you are incorrect, @MSNBC always reports the correct and current stocks, when they were rising, and now they are falling.
5134 2018-02-02 21:08:03 Sold one of my stocks 2 days before the tumble!

5146 2018-02-02 21:06:52 On the day the long awaited FISA memo is released the stock market plunges to a 2-year worse at near 700-point drop. Stocks don't drop on their own that fast. That was done by the Deep state to make Trump look like a failure. Time to remove the Deep state once and for all.

5164 2018-02-02 21:05:49 You are aware that the stock market has always gone up and down. That being said, it may be the memo or it just means people are playing with their stocks in order to get some leverage in other ways. Shorting, investing. Switching strategies?

5168 2018-02-02 21:05:25 1/ It's hard being deep value.  Until the stocks have a panic buy side, they will just keep wilting under the pressure of apathy.  Already their is a glow starting, as crude makes the news, but it will take time to get the commitment to buy.

5174 2018-02-02 21:05:15 It doesn't look like the advancing stocks held on to their less than 10% figure.  It looks like 10.3% and that's close enough to call it 90% down.

5212 2018-02-02 21:02:38 I am somewhat concerned by the potential for a market crash but perhaps it's more likely to slowly waft down as interest rates rise and bond yields increase?

5216 2018-02-02 21:02:09 This is a signal that rising interest rates have made bonds more attractive. Stocks r not the only investment with return now. That and some profit taking are reason.

5237 2018-02-02 20:58:49 DT destroys everything damn thing he touches. Now stocks.
5238 2018-02-02 20:58:44 Looks like the bear stearns stocks. We ded
5239 2018-02-02 20:58:36 Fun fact:  profits as a share of GDP are higher in Japan, but it hasn't really helped Japanese stocks
5240 2018-02-02 20:58:30 hi Trish, First ‘love ur new look ! You’re right that d contents of d partial MEMO  emanate “out of TABLOID/TRASHY” source i.e. Not even rise to d level of “reasonable suspicion” to warrant FISA. 
P.S. Time to buy STOCKS during this “profit-taking”
5241 2018-02-02 20:58:27 Me: Yeah I'm pretty responsible with my money

Also me: *throws $100+ into the stock market that's continuing to decline*

5242 2018-02-02 20:58:27 Question: Is it possible that we're seeing the beginning of a major market correction across the board (stocks & housing especially), and the cryptocurrency market correction was somehow a leading indicator?
5243 2018-02-02 20:58:24 Thank heavens there's the Super Bowl to take our mind off the market. But wait. Won't stocks go down this year if the Pats win? #sarcasm
5244 2018-02-02 20:58:10 Take some advise from a 50 year investor.  Buy stocks when interest rates are going down.  Be very cautious when interest rates are headed higher.  Maybe, the pounding in the market will lead to a bit of bipartisan action?
5245 2018-02-02 20:58:08 FYI my Dad has a Doctorate in Business Administration and worked in Finance most of his 50 year career. He loves Trump, but he’s a firm believer in the Bear Market. Raised us following stocks as a hobby. I wish I had the $ I pretend made!
5246 2018-02-02 20:58:03 Stocks plummet more than 600 points.  @finguys LIVE next at 4pm on WBEN 930 AM with analysis.
5247 2018-02-02 20:58:03 Crazy people panicking and selling stocks when by next Tues. people will be buying.
5248 2018-02-02 20:58:01 Trump owns this! He can't claim victory when the stocks go up and not take the blame when it goes down but he'll try. Here's probably conferring with Miller right now in how to blame someone else!
5249 2018-02-02 20:57:55 @POTUS save us, the stocks are taking a downward turn, what ever will you do to #MAGA ?
5250 2018-02-02 20:57:51 Hi Kevin just saw you on CNBC you mentioned mid cap stocks any recommendations@kevinolearytv
5251 2018-02-02 20:57:50 HA!
Streaming stocks (Amazon, Netflix, Charter) are up while everything else is falling....
5252 2018-02-02 20:57:39 Look what that fucking Obama is doing to the Dow Jones! Down 682! But you know what I’m poor I don’t have any stocks so who gives a shit.
5253 2018-02-02 20:57:32 Shepard Smith is having an organism over the deceitful statements from  the Dems and People like Comey. He sounds gleeful over the stocks dropping... wish he would go join his liberal friends lying Joe and the like.
5254 2018-02-02 20:57:27 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are having their worst week in 2 years w/the Dow down more than 600 points earlier today. Where is your tweet taking credit? It’s OK...I’ll wait. #IdiotInChief #hypocrite #dowjones #WorstPresidentEver
5255 2018-02-02 20:57:24 Plus Trump insisted on releasing #TheMEMO in a concerted effort to topple democracy....#stocks
5256 2018-02-02 20:57:15 Stocks having their worst week in two years. Dow down 600 points at one point today.
5257 2018-02-02 20:57:11 Look @realDonaldTrump  your Russian Buddies are selling off their stocks. Down almost 700 it will be by close of business good job
5258 2018-02-02 20:57:11 The market had to adjust at some point.  Now is maybe the time to buy stocks. The economy looks good.
5259 2018-02-02 20:57:06 Syria voluntarily surrendered all its stocks of Sarin for destruction in 2014 and dismantled all its Sarin manufacturing capability. 2013 Sarin attack in Ghouta was blamed on the rebel group Liwa al Axsa by OPCW investigators. Only USA & Britain could cause new attacks
5260 2018-02-02 20:57:05 So @realDonaldTrump shits the bed again by releasing a memo giving credit to the continued surveillance d/t having the warrants renewed multiple times and digs himself into a deeper hole by attempting to obstruct the investigation again? Good day! Oh wait stocks down 600 pts too
5261 2018-02-02 20:56:48 To Recap:

-Nuclear threats, Gov't shutdowns: Stocks go up.
-Low unemployment, Higher wages: Stocks go down.

I'm sure you can time the market.
5262 2018-02-02 20:56:44 Haha them and telus are my only stocks that were up today. Typical when telus is one of the stocks i want to add too!
5263 2018-02-02 20:56:42 The senators and reps approving contracts in many cas es have vested interest Bc they own stocks in those companies, many hope to hit the revolving  door to lobby their former colleagues. They can insider trade, the “retire” over to K Street and get paid to steer contracts
5264 2018-02-02 20:56:31 Solid wall of red as stocks make new lows on the day. $AAPL just above $160
5265 2018-02-02 20:56:28 if everybody is selling stocks for usd, we have usd-shortage ? stocks fall, usd rise. correct ?
5266 2018-02-02 20:55:52 Added $T @ $38.32 and $ADM @ $41.68 . They will probably drop lower in the coming months but I want to lock in these two dividend stocks for a hedge against the upcoming bear
5267 2018-02-02 20:55:43 Looks like stocks are on sale...time to go shopping.
5268 2018-02-02 20:55:41 Relesed the memo...stocks start to plummet....Obama or Hillary fault...huh
5269 2018-02-02 20:55:37 $SPY hey guys do u think we should short the VIX looks seriously over bought ,probably stocks may improve next week unless fundamentals
5270 2018-02-02 20:55:30 $IWM now falling below 50-day SMA, which may pressure broad market lower.  Lots of great buying opps next week.  #stocks
5271 2018-02-02 20:55:25 Oh it’s going to get worse maybe not bow but trust and believe it’s coming and not just with stocks.
5272 2018-02-02 20:55:24 'Relax Pal. First lesson in business is don't get emotional about stocks..it clouds your judgement' #InTheShorts $DJIA .. $AMZN is up 3%
5273 2018-02-02 20:55:24 Don't panic: This week's market selloff still appears to be well within the bounds of a healthy, normal market fluctuation. I view it as a good opportunity to buy into stocks at more favorable prices.
5274 2018-02-02 20:55:22 I hope people didn't leverage buy stocks over the last month
5275 2018-02-02 20:55:19 I hope he doesn't own stocks. The #TrumpCrash is underway.
5276 2018-02-02 20:55:13 If you're Janet Yellen, isn't there a part of you, a very small part hopefully, that gains satisfaction from stocks plunging the day you leave office?
5277 2018-02-02 20:55:06 Stocks done shitted on me today
5278 2018-02-02 20:55:03 But also more that 50% of Americans don’t even own stocks
5279 2018-02-02 20:54:59 Who's dumbass idea was it to put oversized stocks on a truck.
5280 2018-02-02 20:54:53 Anyone catching @ShepNewsTeam rebuttal of the released Memo on @FoxNews his disdain for @realDonaldTrump is as obvious as @FoxNews scared to fire him stocks drop and hes blaming Trump boycott Fox news at 2:00 pm est watch how fast hes working for CNN
5281 2018-02-02 20:54:32 Jordan, stick to penny stocks man...
5282 2018-02-02 20:54:29 Hi Luke, do you only trade stocks or options too?
5283 2018-02-02 20:54:04 I'm not seeing many headlines about a "Melt-up" any more.  What goes up.. #DowJones #StockMarket #stocks #investing #retirement
5284 2018-02-02 20:53:59 Beaufield $BFD touched .12 then CIBC scoops it up to .16!

Hmmm.... I own it.

Osisko $OSK owns 27% of it.

#stocks #trading $$ #Gold
5285 2018-02-02 20:53:58 @CNN is trying to pull attention away from #memoday with a giant breaking news header about stocks at a two year all time low, and calling it the "disputed memo" half a dozen times/headlines.
5286 2018-02-02 20:53:41 Actually, it has to do with the jobs numbers.
Stocks fear a massive rate hike.

You know...the other corrupt non-elected entity.
5287 2018-02-02 20:53:41 My micro & small cap commodity stocks are holding up. Sans Ivanhoe & Katanga - but I'm way up on those. @AndrewBellBNN @CatherineBizTV
5288 2018-02-02 20:53:35 How about those tax breaks, stocks would be doing a hell of a lot better if they were given to the middle on down, the trickle up will work
5289 2018-02-02 20:53:30 $SPY $DIA $IWM $QQQ I agree w/ kevin. hence why I spent earlier this week; looking at ALL the stocks in the russell 2000!
5290 2018-02-02 20:53:26 #Brexit #PrimeMinister Do not allow the EU to fish our seas, we need to be able to manage the stocks.
5291 2018-02-02 20:53:06 Although you don't generally see ads promoting different stocks/companies to invest in. Not saying it's the same but Maybe they are trying to make it more professional? Just thinking here
5292 2018-02-02 20:52:57 Yes, U.S. stocks more generally are now down like 2/3rds of a trillion now.
5293 2018-02-02 20:52:05 Oh, hopefully this is the real correction. When it bottoms out, gonna jump in on stocks.
5294 2018-02-02 20:52:04 THANKS @realDonaldTrump ! Now you really have something to boast about ... another record !!!
“Dow plunges 650 points as stocks head for worst week in 2 years.”
5295 2018-02-02 20:51:45 @ShepNewsTeam mmmmm it seems like u are HAPPY The stocks are down. It seems you are Liberal who wants our President to fail!? I won’t be watching you ANYMORE & I’m sure I’m not the only one! Thanks for showtime us your true colors everyday! BYE!!
5296 2018-02-02 20:51:38 Stocks still in collapse-down 650 . Stay long SPXS and wait for sell-off to end & to go long stocks or ETF's.  #Stocks #Commodities #ETF #Invest
5297 2018-02-02 20:51:27 Stocks down??????
5298 2018-02-02 20:51:14 Stocks goes up and stocks go down that's the way it goes.
5299 2018-02-02 20:51:03 @ShepNewsTeam 
DOW down?
Driving down the drain?
You're some kind of "special". You don't know much about stocks do you? We're doing FANTASTIC! Talk to me when we're back to Husseins embarrassing rates.
5300 2018-02-02 20:50:51 It's just sell mania. People are shifting out bonds and stocks and into cash. Nothing else explains fall of both, and a higher dollar.
5301 2018-02-02 20:50:44 I own 3, but don't ask out of how many stocks that I own, I'm so ashamed. LOL
5302 2018-02-02 20:50:41 It'll be interesting to see if they do follow that pattern. Oil prices peaked well after stocks, and not months into the recesson. Will FANG stocks peak after the overall market? Certainly a reasonable bet as markets usually narrow as they lose steam.
5303 2018-02-02 20:50:26 Stocks are not happy!
5304 2018-02-02 20:50:16 Stocks having their worst week in two years. #ThanksTrump
5305 2018-02-02 20:50:14 This doesn't prove your intended point. If crypto goes up when stocks go down it would be correlated negatively
5306 2018-02-02 20:50:12 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are having their worst day in over two years. #NunesMemo #Corruption #RussiaGate #MAGA
5307 2018-02-02 20:50:08 Who knew picking which stocks to put in the Dow could be so difficult?

5310 2018-02-02 20:49:42 Stocks are down and crypt down. This is a sad fucking day for my financials. 
On the bright side it’s Friday, a new month and I’m in a good mood. 
5311 2018-02-02 20:49:41 Reminds me of Brexit. Dow dropped like a stone that Friday and was back a week later. #Brexit #stocks #markets $Study

5313 2018-02-02 20:49:30 Right but the bailout won't happen until shit is really hitting the fan. The economy won't crash all in one day. Crypto will fall with stocks until a big change
5314 2018-02-02 20:49:26 worst day for stocks in years. Might end up being top 3 worst day in market history. Likely down over 5% this week. Weak jobs report. Bad news for black unemployment. Obama effect ending and trump effect taking over.
5315 2018-02-02 20:49:21 The market is tanking. Ugh! #markets #stocks #optionstrading

5318 2018-02-02 20:49:05 Why is there a huge drop in #NYSE? Dem politicians selling off stocks & bonds to pay for top $$ attorneys for the coming #Storm.
5319 2018-02-02 20:49:03 Finance news beat - Last month: Dow 26K! It's raining money!
Finance news beat - Today: Stocks plunge over 600 points because reasons! Doom or Megadoom?

Millennials: And y'all wonder why we're not keen to pin our entire financial futures on stocks.
5320 2018-02-02 20:49:03 Good US labour market numbers:  Wages picking up too:  But stocks down 600 points, US/Australian 10 year bonds a tick or two away from par; AUD getting hosed at 0.7935 - happy days
5321 2018-02-02 20:48:37 Def not Bullish because u can buy stocks with credit, but it will help stabilize the market. Also if people shouldn’t be able to use money they don’t have. These banks need to stop making billions on overdraft fees
5322 2018-02-02 20:48:32 And all of the Dow 30 stocks are in the red today.

5323 2018-02-02 20:48:28 @cvpayne @Liz_Wheeler @LizClaman @CGasparino all the  text reading bots are dumping stocks:my guess is alot short selling, margin calls, stop losses, portfolio insurance: perfect storm! investors should not forget better earnings do not lead to recession!
5324 2018-02-02 20:48:15 Hey @realDonaldTrump, you own this economy now. Better get your friends to start buying stocks to prop it up!
5325 2018-02-02 20:48:13 You know this country don't have a shot when one party (DEM) has the power to drop stocks to change the headlines think about that people.
5326 2018-02-02 20:48:07 I typically stick to only trading small cap stocks. I prefer swig trades where I can make 50-100% gains.
5327 2018-02-02 20:47:51 remember when Trump blamed what's his face for the drop in stocks and encourage everyone to sue........can we apply the same logic here?
5328 2018-02-02 20:47:18 Right?!  Exactly!  The left is so narcissistic to believe they had a thing to do with the rebound.  Trump--by merely just being elected made stocks soar!  Confident in his zeal to build business!  Obama was consumed in building government!

5337 2018-02-02 20:46:06 When your Union invests the pension funds in stocks as they all do, you better care.
5338 2018-02-02 20:45:39 I look at bank accounts- assets-stocks-real estate-  only a good businessman will accumulate that many assets.  It takes brains to make money and brains to keep it.  So you don’t like TRUMPS personality JEALOUSY—he has the brains not you

5350 2018-02-02 20:43:26 What the heck is going on with the stock market ?? DOW is down over $600 . My stocks are taking a beating !
5351 2018-02-02 20:43:20 it still beats leaving money in bank account, stocks will go back up - but money in the bank - you lose every single day, and will never go up 
5352 2018-02-02 20:43:19 Stocks will fall as $ slides & rates up as government borrowing shoots up. If you invested in individual stocks you have a problem. But if you invest like me in ETFs like SPY & ACWI you will recover as long as the world is not going to end. Prospects for world good in my view.
5353 2018-02-02 20:43:04 Wondering that no one is complaining about illegal short sellers in the market for stocks like $XXII $RIOT $DPW $LFIN $OSTK $XNET and so on.

5356 2018-02-02 20:42:31 $HMNY is one of a few green stocks today. One multi-billion dollar hedge fund just disclosed it acquired a total beneficial ownership of 9.99% 2.06M shs as of 12/31/17. Note HMNY made a $60M share offering in Dec. So it is likely part of shares acquired are from the offering.

Looks like this is finally @realDonaldTrump ‘s stock market.

What a pathetic loser he is!

PMs are going to get killed after this Huge correction Up. Cryptos are going to take over completely and drive dwn Ag to 7.50 and 730ish for Gold. First 34.50 and 1750 for PMs.
5372 2018-02-02 20:38:53 Holy shit I'm glad I sold all my stocks yesterday. Hopefully it's a correction for all of us to gobble them up soon. #StockMarket #DowJones
5373 2018-02-02 20:38:46 "Stocks have skyrocketed" in the #OBAMA Bull Market that started in 2009. No uptrend lasts forever and a big correction wd be no surprise regardless of who is in the WK
5374 2018-02-02 20:38:36 Plot demand inside that range, to give context of current stocks.  You will quickly notice current stocks are dangerously low in relation to current demand trend.
5375 2018-02-02 20:38:11 a correction? well only an idiot didn't see that coming.  great discounts today.  #stocks

5378 2018-02-02 20:37:33 All you media people may say you don't like the Dow Jones, but no headline sizzles better than "Stocks down x00 points!"
5379 2018-02-02 20:37:18 Hey @realDonaldTrump since you take credit for when the stock market goes up, then it must be your fault that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone down 600+ points, making this the worst week for stocks in 2 years.
5380 2018-02-02 20:37:16 Crude oil only down 43 cents, yet massive selling in the stocks. What gives?

5383 2018-02-02 20:36:55 Nice work, Paul.. as of 2 weeks ago, 50% of the stocks in the DJA index were at 52week highs, an all time peak percentage.. now around 5%.. time to close your position?
5384 2018-02-02 20:36:47 The shorts are selling stocks and winning. Donald Trump is spreading bullshit and losing
5385 2018-02-02 20:36:47 Follow everyone who LIKES this
5386 2018-02-02 20:36:30 Should be watching what’s happening with bonds not price action of stocks.
5387 2018-02-02 20:36:03 From Dec 24, 2015 to Mid Jan 2016 the Dow went down 1500 points... with many speculative reasons. Is this a similar pause before the markets go higher? 10 year bonds still below 3% yield...way below stocks.
5388 2018-02-02 20:35:58 The DOW is down 500 points?! Good time to buy more stocks #buylow #sellhigh 
5389 2018-02-02 20:35:57 Stocks aree not falling because minimum wage hike !!!! 
Stocks are falling because of uncertian investment into bonuses. Pensions. Health plan by corp.

Create less balance on corp books 
Witch cause uncertainty in markets
5390 2018-02-02 20:35:49 right now stocks at about down 600, looking to be in the top 10 of largest stock point losses. MAGA

5392 2018-02-02 20:35:42 stocks in intermediate-term uptrends don't get oversold in a 14 day RSI. it's just not something we normally see. $AAPL got oversold this week
5393 2018-02-02 20:35:36 Stocks Take Biggest Tumble in Two Years
5394 2018-02-02 20:35:33 Today's drop in stocks has erased all stock market gains since January 10th. All from a 4 page memo.
5395 2018-02-02 20:35:23 @Jason should we sell sell sell our stocks? bubble territory right? your a delusional silicon valley boy who doesnt understand crypto
5396 2018-02-02 20:35:05 Trump took credit for stock market going up and now Trump releases Republican Memo and stocks drop! Will he take credit for the drop?
5397 2018-02-02 20:35:01 $chtr and $lmb. Wish I felt vindicated with the rest of my stocks though too on days like this.

5399 2018-02-02 20:34:42 All this threatening the justice and law enforcement institutions over the #NunesMemo has contributed to a very nervous wall street and a plunge in stocks today. Nice going @realDonaldTrump, you dumbass.
5400 2018-02-02 20:34:39 Dow down 600pts cause all the #releasethememo trolls are dumping their stocks before they go on a well earned vacation to Mar-a-Lago
5401 2018-02-02 20:34:27 Stocks down 614 wow
5402 2018-02-02 20:34:20 I live on S.S....IF inflation is truly about to kick in (witch MAY be the reason for the market drop)...I'LL FINALLY GET A RAISE IN MY S.S. like the rest of you have been getting from your stocks investments, and I've been, getting NOTHING...ABOUT TIME...
5403 2018-02-02 20:33:56 It was the worst day for stocks since President Trump took office. The plunge was a reversal from the heady sentiment that has defined the markets for most of the past year. The stock market has been on a historic nine-year bull run. Investors are rattled by lackluster earnings
5404 2018-02-02 20:33:46 Today's drop in stocks has erased all stock market gains since January 10th. All from a 4 page memo.
5405 2018-02-02 20:33:37 His friends got their tax cut. Now they are cutting away from stocks. Market on Pace to lose 1000 points.

5407 2018-02-02 20:33:29 The Soros and Rothschilds attacking stocks today
5408 2018-02-02 20:33:28 @realDonaldTrump - if you resign, I bet the stock market will rebound. How about it? #TheResistance #stocks #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TraitorInChief
5409 2018-02-02 20:33:20 It was the worst day for stocks since President Trump took office. The plunge was a reversal from the heady sentiment that has defined the markets for most of the past year.

5410 2018-02-02 20:33:13 $VIX has obviously spiked up with the market in turmoil.  Once it settles, time to sell cash-secured puts for the stocks one wants to own.
5411 2018-02-02 20:33:11 Libs are dumping their stocks today, which creates more buy opportunities for the rest of us that didn't benefit from Obama's crony Wall Street.
5412 2018-02-02 20:33:01 As of now, stocks down by 610
5413 2018-02-02 20:32:53 Where’s Tom Denmark? He usually pops up in a pullback and claims he predicted it.. #stocks #markets
5414 2018-02-02 20:32:53 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec I guess the stock market doesnt like a traitor in the White House. Now that you can’t talk about stocks, what’s left?

5416 2018-02-02 20:32:40 Shepherd Smith, are you excited that the stock market has gone down today substantially?  A joyful look was definitely on your face when you stated the information on live TV!  It is not good for anyone for stocks to come down!

5420 2018-02-02 20:32:26 What’s going on with the Dow and stocks today?
5421 2018-02-02 20:32:25 US stocks seems to be closing on lows, very bad sign.
5422 2018-02-02 20:32:23 Who know's how about companies letting people buy STOCKs? From the looks of things, today aint so great. I would still rather own #Bitcoin
5423 2018-02-02 20:32:21 It was damn strong. Practically every American who wants a job got one by now. Wages starting to feel the pressure. That said market cannot justify such lofty valuations of stocks.

5425 2018-02-02 20:32:06 #DOW_Down 550+ point finally a day I could buy some stocks! Apple makes more money than Amazon ever has and it still goes down. Down about $6.50  #SomethingThingsDontMakeSense
5426 2018-02-02 20:31:54 shep is thrilled that stocks are down & refusing to accept memo.  can't stand him
5427 2018-02-02 20:31:40 Short selling a few stocks atm. Higher risk plays but with a day like today you have to ride the selling momentum
5428 2018-02-02 20:31:39 What about the 6000 Bureau of Prisons jobs cut so that the private prison companies that donated to your campaign can bring their stocks up? Even though it’s a proven fact that private prisons are worse for all parties? #privateprisonbailout #quidproquo

5430 2018-02-02 20:31:22 It was Russia, the evidence is accumulating and stocks are starting to drop.
5431 2018-02-02 20:31:15 The DOW Is irrelevant to these stocks...are you really a shareholder?
5432 2018-02-02 20:31:12 why are all my gold stocks down peter
5433 2018-02-02 20:31:07 Maybe tech stocks are finally correcting
5434 2018-02-02 20:31:01 @cvpayne could market manipulators be taking advantage of Fed transition to sell bonds & drive up yields which would tie to stocks? @SEC_Enforcement @stevenmnuchin1 should check who was holding SP500 puts this week.
5435 2018-02-02 20:30:58 Dow drops 600 Pts. Worse 2 week streak in 9 years. Trump Dumps stocks. !!!!!
5436 2018-02-02 20:30:27 So why are stocks down 600 points today?
5437 2018-02-02 20:30:19 Invest in stocks also, never know what could happen in the market

5442 2018-02-02 20:29:37 Even the DOW knows @realDonaldTrump is a shameful dumbass & is reacting accordingly.  Though it's a great time for him & his billionair buddies to buy up some stocks. They said it would happen.
5443 2018-02-02 20:29:28 Your bonus will not be that good...

No longer great 401k's .....stocks dropping today really bad

Trump asked Congress 13 billion for border wall(what happen to Mexico paying?)

Republicans want a  Gas tax

Inflation & higher interest rates eating away at your money
5444 2018-02-02 20:29:23 Did a groundhog tell people to sell stocks?
5445 2018-02-02 20:29:20 Thought you were so Fair & Balanced? Shouldn’t you wait for the Democrats Memo? Also , DOW  DOWN  1050 Points for the Week. Largest Drop in 2 Years. SELL YOUR STOCKS NOW! Trumps Policies will Destroy Our Economy!
5446 2018-02-02 20:29:07 Sir, can you turn down Jim Cramer on your tv while you’re screaming at me quotes of your losing stocks. That’d be much appreciate thx
5447 2018-02-02 20:29:05 The market is dropping all over. There's several reasons why. In tech we have Apple hurting stocks but will raise up. In Coin we have S.K and India along with coin mergers. But all these trends will stall. The market will balance! Wait for correction and watch.
5448 2018-02-02 20:28:59 $SPY $QQQ down. $BTC down. $GLD $GC_F down. $DXY up? Money still goes to the greenback when its scared... #stocks #USD
5449 2018-02-02 20:28:56 Crashing stocks means more profits
5450 2018-02-02 20:28:52 @realDonaldTrump rejected ed his earlier "ugly bubble" theory of U.S. stocks. Instead, he claimed HIS responsibility for the price action. Please, then, @EricTrump @PressSec et al: explain why he's chosen to trigger this week's serious pullback and to make many Americans poorer.
5451 2018-02-02 20:28:31 Maybe because most those stocks fund DNC people? Of course they are gonna tank. They're fucked.
5452 2018-02-02 20:28:30 technically yes, never on a Friday, ?ìd be patient to see what US stocks do on Monday

5455 2018-02-02 20:28:11 it's all about power, they never cared for the interests of the american people. After all, they created a "Healthcare plan" they knew would only hurt Americans, then bought stocks in the providers involved, making a fortune off the artificially raised stocks!

5458 2018-02-02 20:27:42 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  Why aren’t you guys taking credit for this? Obama’s fault when stocks decline?
5459 2018-02-02 20:27:34 Really?? You’re going to point a small downturn in stocks after record breaking climbs over the past year? Desperate to turn focus off that memo that shows illegal activity by Clinton and Supporters?
5460 2018-02-02 20:27:32 Stocks are crashing ( buy lower is an equity strategy) Treasury yields rising. Higher credit card and mortgage rates coming.

5478 2018-02-02 20:24:36 Don't look for our president to site biggest weekly stocks drop in two years in the week of his SOTU. Nothing to do with each other, really, but imagine the bellowing if it'd gone up.

5483 2018-02-02 20:23:53 I think her point may be that stocks fell becuz trump cared more about deflecting an investigation getting too close to him than about American people.  Trying to discredit the FBI and DOJ works to the detriment of ALL of us.
5484 2018-02-02 20:23:25 It's insulting that GOP keeps changing their stories,facts,evidence because GOP doesn't think We are paying attention Well we are Just so you know,
GOPs Credibility OUT THE WINDOW TRUST,LIKE YOUR STOCKS...GOING DOWN FAST
5485 2018-02-02 20:23:15 With .@realDonaldTrump being the savvy money businessman he claims to be, you'd think he would've known the stock market hates uncertainty and that the release of the memo would send stocks spiraling downward. Guess we gave him too much credit (bank sarcasm).
5486 2018-02-02 20:23:13 This State is Moving Backwards Instead of Forwards. I live Under Draconian laws. Would not Surprise me if we go Back to Public Floggings and Placing People in Stocks. I Wonder if their Unwillingness to Learn about Medical Marijuana has Anything to do with Eli Lily? 
5487 2018-02-02 20:23:08 As a long term investor...and a systematic buyer of stocks every 2 weeks (I have a 401K)...I don't mind days like today because it means a chance to buy at lower prices...

Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
5501 2018-02-02 20:20:21 I'm a secret democrat working for the FBI. Trust me we all say we are republican's but we have a secret democrat meetup. Obviously we all make trillions of dollars a year so we by stocks so we can crash the market whenever we want. #spylife
5502 2018-02-02 20:20:15 The DJIA went down another 300 points but the pot stocks are just a tad under where they were at Noon. So actually hanging in there. APH, ACB and WEED all down 40% from their highs.
5503 2018-02-02 20:20:06 This weekend I'll be running 100's of VRA scans/screens. Stocks that I was forced to hold off buying (prices too high) are inching back to attractive levels. Acting vs reacting. A 500 pt decline at the open on Monday night just do it. #VRA #Discipline
5504 2018-02-02 20:20:05 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.
5505 2018-02-02 20:19:53 Thank's to Clowns at JW like Fitton, GOP & TRUMP Stocks take Dive.
5506 2018-02-02 20:19:52 LOL Poor Jonno, er I mean chooky.
People are interested in what stocks I like.
You would be doing much better than you are now, by following them.
My ethics are, you wont see me selling while ramping them to blazes on social media and stock forums to newbies
5507 2018-02-02 20:19:52 #ALERT Don't sell your stocks; now is not the time.
5508 2018-02-02 20:19:41 Nobody should cheer this disaster of a day for #stocks but since Trump cheerleads it so much maybe he should try to make people feel better about it. Oh nevermind! He’s undermining the #FBI at a retreat in West Virginia..
5509 2018-02-02 20:19:32 Last week: we’re overdue for a healthy correction

[stocks fall 4%]

FEAR GRIPS WALL STREET: NO END IN SIGHT
5510 2018-02-02 20:19:29 Good morning. Stocks are down and bitcoin is up. What happened, America?
5511 2018-02-02 20:19:11 Markets are down 500+ #stocks #ThanksTrump
5512 2018-02-02 20:19:07 $TVOG plenty of catalysts to come, just to name a few:
- Form 10 filling
- $25M deal done with $NTFL
- Uplist to #NASDAQ
- Ticker & name change coming 
- Using #blockchain
- $1.5 Trillion #infrastructure bill PR
Be patient and load up this dip 
#Stocks #bitcoin #Pennystocks
5513 2018-02-02 20:19:04 Should I  buy stocks with all the money I'll be saving on taxes?  Joking. That money is already spent on the increased cost of living that wages haven't caught up with, because I'm not a billionaire getting to keep thousands upon thousands of dollars.
5514 2018-02-02 20:18:58 I don't really have one specific I go to i started with video's explaining stock volume and just kept watching related videos also looking on td ameritrade for actual stocks to relate with
5515 2018-02-02 20:18:55 Just opened my IRA and bought some stocks/mutual funds/CD's. Adulting like a boss today.
5516 2018-02-02 20:18:54 @CNBC says “U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.”
As if it wasn’t dropping average more than a point a minute even immediately after.
5517 2018-02-02 20:18:51 The stock market was climbing because after the cutting of regulations and the tax scam all those companies started buying up their own stocks causing a false bull market for a while now it’s correcting.
5518 2018-02-02 20:18:48 Oh hello volatility ... we’ve missed you .... DOW down 600. #stocks #risinginterestrates
5519 2018-02-02 20:18:22 We should cash in our bitcoin and buy cheap stocks lol 
5520 2018-02-02 20:18:18 Stocks in collapse 609 points down today-stay long SPXS & Stay long TMV Bear bond fund. #Commodities #Stocks #Bonds #ETF #Invest
5521 2018-02-02 20:18:15 The markets dropped more than 2 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 500 points, in the worst day for stocks since President Trump took office.     Where is Dick head now@therealdonaldtrump
5522 2018-02-02 20:18:14 If this week's market action triggered your stops on certain stocks, you should be in good shape.  Now, we wait for the selling to exhaust itself and go bargain hunting for those growth stocks with the most upside potential.
5523 2018-02-02 20:18:07 $VRTX The company very smart that aimed $500M shares buy back stocks because they know after earning the stock always selloff.  Good time for the company scoop up the cheap shares.  Long on it.
5524 2018-02-02 20:17:51 @realDonaldTrump uh...how come you aren't bragging about stocks today? Are you still the president or not?
5525 2018-02-02 20:17:47 Stocks dropping pushing ,700pts
5526 2018-02-02 20:17:45 As someone 30 years from retirement I'm less than sad to see stocks correct themselves right before my 401k profit share hits 
5527 2018-02-02 20:17:39 Stocks down the same week as SOTU?  Will @POTUS claim this?
5528 2018-02-02 20:17:19 Wicked action. The rules keep us out of trouble. Minimizes decision making. Which minimizes stress. Which helps us think clearer. #stocks
5529 2018-02-02 20:17:14 If ML & increased data availability lead to better investment management, making better value predictions, breakout opportunities, and this is democrataized. Doesn't this just mean the market will become even more efficient than it is? No stocks will be under or over valued?
5530 2018-02-02 20:17:08 Stocks are in a sea of red today. Never fun to see a reversal in the markets good fortunes, but it shouldn’t be concerning to anyone who thinks long term.
5531 2018-02-02 20:17:06 Hey, "Orator of Greatness?" How are those stocks working out for you today?
5532 2018-02-02 20:17:01 Makes you wonder...are the DEMOCRAPS selling off their stocks so they can get out of the country?  Lets call a roll call for Congress AND Senate!  LOL
5533 2018-02-02 20:16:53 Stocks are tanking and the memo has been exposed as a tool for obstruction. All bets are this will be as high as it goes
5534 2018-02-02 20:16:39 Conditions are ripe for a major #FalseFlag
Pentagon missing $21 trillion
Govt approval ratings @ all time lows
Stocks & Cryptos crashing #HighAnxiety
#NorthKorea called out in #SOTU as a #MissileThreat
#NFL record low attendance
#SuperBowl security co replaced
#OnlyWarCanSaveThem
5535 2018-02-02 20:16:34 Still waiting for #Trump to take blame for stock market drop today. Can't shut him up when stocks rise.
5536 2018-02-02 20:16:28 Stocks took a little hit today didn't they 
5537 2018-02-02 20:16:28 TODAY I SOLD ALL MY U.S. STOCKS. I WILL NOT INVEST IN A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT.
5538 2018-02-02 20:16:25 Where is the money going? Stocks, gold, dollar, bonds and cryptos down.
5539 2018-02-02 20:16:25 Treason does that. Oh, and so does foreign foes selling off American stocks in a coordinated effort to destroy us.
5540 2018-02-02 20:16:25 Will go down in history with Irving Fisher's "stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau" comment in 1929.
5541 2018-02-02 20:16:19 Stocks and Treasuries both at the lows of day.  Perhaps not a surprise but portfolio theory has truly broken down here.
5542 2018-02-02 20:15:54 After this week, at least we can all be almost sure where we can find our support levels in the stocks...
5543 2018-02-02 20:15:38 Stocks dropped 600 today, @realDonaldTrump You want rh highs?  Gotta accept the lows. #maga
5544 2018-02-02 20:15:20 Yes, I've seen it too often. Good jobs report/stocks fall. Layoffs/stocks rise.
5545 2018-02-02 20:15:20 Why is no one talking about how shitty my stocks are doing today?
5546 2018-02-02 20:15:18 Closer to 600 right now. Wake up America. This isn’t the second coming of Jesus and Trump will destroy us. #stocks #DevinNunesTraitor
5547 2018-02-02 20:15:11 Big mistake I have made in the past is to try to Hedge exactly with huge Short Position on Index. Far better to Short smaller & try to reduce impact of Drawdown on Portfolio rather than negating whole Drawdown. After these moves a diverse Portfolio of Quality Stocks bounces back.
5548 2018-02-02 20:15:05 Did our president tweet about stocks today
5549 2018-02-02 20:15:05 Meanwhile the Stocks plummeted today, down 600 points.
5550 2018-02-02 20:15:04 They will drop again as our stocks our plummeting and your tax cuts will not even cover what is being loss.
5551 2018-02-02 20:14:37 That's not what the market is worried about. Investors are worried inflation may heat up faster than thought, inflation could eat into profits, meaning stocks are mis-priced.  Market is trying to find the right price given the new info. So no one is suggesting more hiring is bad.
5552 2018-02-02 20:14:31 Watch Howie Carr newsmax. Instead of Shep or f bizz cryin over her stocks.
5553 2018-02-02 20:14:28 Took about a 1% loss in my portfolio today.  I'm actually very happy with that considering.  50% stocks 50% cash.
5554 2018-02-02 20:14:27 Stands to reason the larger the stock market the larger the swings , or readjustments, might be a good time to buy some cheak stocks ?
5555 2018-02-02 20:14:12 Just wondering as the Dow declines 1,000 point for the week:  Trump claimed rise in stocks due to his leadership.  Is sell-off also due to his leadership?
5556 2018-02-02 20:14:02 So if I follow climate change/global warming denier logic: this week of bad stocks must mean the economy is crap.
5557 2018-02-02 20:13:54 You can't even eat stocks markets though...
5558 2018-02-02 20:13:48 Would you buy stocks on a credit card though?
5559 2018-02-02 20:13:37 So will Trump take credit for a 634 point Dow Jones stock plunge just like the way he takes credit when stocks are up? 
5560 2018-02-02 20:13:37 Hillary obviously. Good news is real working people don’t have stocks (anymore) so maybe they won’t be the ones to suffer. I’m sure the ‘Hedge funds’ will be fine though.
5561 2018-02-02 20:13:26 If you’re gonna take the compliments then you gotta take the hate. If you don’t have haters that just means you aren’t very good!  You have haters because you’re good! Embrace them kiddo.
5562 2018-02-02 20:13:24 Lol hahahHahaha oh my the Memo what a joke. Page is a agent 4 Russia, stand by ur Comrade. Hey how ur stocks doing this p.m.
5563 2018-02-02 20:13:13 Stocks fell due to rising interest rates whick happens in Bull markets.  OBAMA artificially held rates down to bolster his fake economy.  We will have to pay for that.
5564 2018-02-02 20:13:12 OUTERTECH CIRCLE stocks slump
5565 2018-02-02 20:13:08 Boy if you call a 2% drop a crash...

You should never invest in stocks.  Your investment advisor will be pulling their hair out of their head dealing with you.
5566 2018-02-02 20:12:50 Hey BigCheds,  i asked u yesterday if this going to happen , and it looks like the beginning of crypto slump spilling over onto stocks, even even some big companies report record profits. Fiat is leaving stocks and its getting parked into crypto hedge funds that short crypto imo
5567 2018-02-02 20:12:42 Understand history and name recognition of #DowJones  but remember folks, 30 stocks and its price-weighted. #SP500 - a much more representative index - is having a brutal day too, but nothing historically bad.
5568 2018-02-02 20:12:42 Stocks are tanking today. Taking credit for that or blaming everyone else???
5569 2018-02-02 20:12:41 Hey, orator, stocks looking a little rocky today!
5570 2018-02-02 20:12:33 Stocks now down 630 points.....

5572 2018-02-02 20:12:13 Dow drops 550 points as stocks head for worst week in 2 years - CNBC
5573 2018-02-02 20:12:00 wall street is acting up again, just like in 2008. they are shorting stocks and have a ball, will hurt all of us.
take care of the fed and the interest rate. the sooner the better.
5574 2018-02-02 20:11:54 All stocks mean reverting to 50MA. we are so far extended it makes my head hurt.  Shorts working.

5576 2018-02-02 20:11:50 Will stocks look like cryptos?
5577 2018-02-02 20:11:47 Thanks @realDonaldTrump for screwing up what President Obama had going GREAT! Today, worst day for stocks in TWO YEARS. Yellen removed after 1 term.  The dummy strikes again...Trump.
5578 2018-02-02 20:11:45 Dow down a ton but still above 25000, dollar up big but still under 90 and in a bear market. gold down big but still above 1300. The real loser today is mining stocks.. Most at month long lows, some silver miners at a year long lows. hate to see it, but its another buy day for me
5579 2018-02-02 20:11:39 My retirement investments are taking a beating this week. The stock market won’t close soon enough for me today  #stocks
5580 2018-02-02 20:11:33 #FakeNews @cnn hasn’t reported on the @DowJones since @realDonaldTrump became president. Today, they report because it’s down & their bull shit story about #Collusion is dead. They must move on, so #Stocks...
5581 2018-02-02 20:11:31 my bad. You draw same as for stocks. Got cobfused. Btc _could_ do this but bankers are in. Won't happen.
5582 2018-02-02 20:11:22 Thats just all the Dem elites selling off stocks before they flee the country.
5583 2018-02-02 20:11:17 Liberal logic

Stocks up = thanks Obama!

Stocks down= its Trumps fault!
5584 2018-02-02 20:11:16 Crissy, lives on Morningside Canyon with 2 cats.

Put all their savings into cayenne pepper stocks. Can't retire.
5585 2018-02-02 20:11:16 So Donnie John, where's your tweet about #Stocks falling 600+ points & still dropping as of 3pm EST? You (falsely) grab credit for the highs. How about some apologies for the drop? Yeah, didn't think so. #TrumpResign #ShitholePresident #Resist #FBR
5586 2018-02-02 20:11:08 After a long glide higher, U.S. stocks are on track for their worst week since February 2016, as investors worry about rising interest rates.
5587 2018-02-02 20:11:06 Oh look air stocks falling thro the floor SPX down 2.1%
5588 2018-02-02 20:11:04 Just brought a few stocks down 10% for no reason @RobinhoodApp is the quickest and cheapest way to buy most stocks, hope #OTC stocks are added soon!
5589 2018-02-02 20:11:00 good! Everyone should sells their stocks now-before it is too late.
5590 2018-02-02 20:10:56 Hillary and Obama probably selling their stocks #MemoDay
5591 2018-02-02 20:10:53 So Donnie John, where's your tweet about #Stocks falling 600+ points & still dropping as of 3pm EST? You (falsely) grab credit for the highs. How about some apologies for the drop? Yeah, didn't think so. #TrumpResign #ShitholePresident #Resist #FBR
5592 2018-02-02 20:10:50 The market is down a couple of percentage points from its all-time high. Financial Professionals and the media have been screaming for a correction so when it goes down a couple of ticks all of a sudden the sky is falling. #stocks #markets #CNBC

5595 2018-02-02 20:10:24 @POTUS
STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN  TRUMP'S Presidency is GOING DOWNGOP GOING DOWN
5596 2018-02-02 20:10:19 and now his last saving grace, the #DOW falls drastically... and while he takes credit for stocks rising I’ll bet you all the money he blames this on someone else. probably @HillaryClinton
5597 2018-02-02 20:10:17 @realDonaldTrump since you take credit for where the stock market is, can you tell us why you are making it drop 630 points today? What's the strategy behind the drop? Please explain... #StockMarket #stocks
5598 2018-02-02 20:10:15 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

I sold all my stocks this morning, in protest to the trump regime, and in support of the FBI!! #ISupportTheFBI
#FBI #SellYourStocks #stockmarket #stocks
5602 2018-02-02 20:09:48 Stocks: puke. bonds: puke. cryptos puke. I'll be back at it next week
5603 2018-02-02 20:09:46 @realDonaldTrump #stocks #MAGA Hey Little Donny, good thing #SOTU was Tuesday.  #WSJ - DJIA to lose 3.7% this week   If you take credit for upside, then downside is yours too
5604 2018-02-02 20:09:44 Funny how $BTC has shifted my view of drops.  US Stocks drop of 2% feels like nothing now.
5605 2018-02-02 20:09:35 I thought your side said the stocks were all from obama?
5606 2018-02-02 20:09:31 PGP key encryption? No? Then why are you in this ecosystem? Penny Stocks are doing just fine? Suspiciously borderline malicious negligence or downright ignorance.
5607 2018-02-02 20:09:30 won't happen like that. If stocks drop 80%? End of world scenario.
5608 2018-02-02 20:09:21 Stocks dropped due to rising interest rates and overinflated markets. A correction was due. The memo has nothing to do with the stock market. Do your homework
5609 2018-02-02 20:09:17 Just good old greed and human nature causing sell off. Stocks needed a rest
5610 2018-02-02 20:09:02 You're giving me advice, & yet...you know nothing of our stock market & how it works? Stocks ARE a part of our world, dear...whether you like it or not. How does one "RAKE" responsibility? How do I "DOKNT" be a victim? And a little elbow room is no match for a PALACE or MANSION.
5611 2018-02-02 20:09:02 Oh sure, we get a nothing memo release, and my stocks are going down. This is Trumps America.
5612 2018-02-02 20:09:01 FYI - for future reference when you feel that the stock market will tank for whatever reason. And longs and even shorts for individual stocks are risky to play.

Check out the $VXX (short-term futures index).  It is up today over 14% & climbing. Nice safe play on days like today
5613 2018-02-02 20:08:45 Nice work Trump stocks just dropped to 600 in the time of starting this txt it was 500 it’s getting kinda scary! Trump effect 2.5 % decline now!
5614 2018-02-02 20:08:43 Do people even invest in stocks still or just crypto and ICOs? #RandomThoughts
5615 2018-02-02 20:08:41 Don’t believe it? $indu #DowJones is down again... Well $btc $eth reached the low (for now at 7500) I suspect if February 9th is wide spread even to #stocks #NASDAQ ? Hmmm
5616 2018-02-02 20:08:27 With the release of the FISA Memo, time for everybody on both sides of the Pond to buy stocks in Lamppost, Rope and Firearms Companies...

5619 2018-02-02 20:08:12 Good thing I sold all my US stocks and invested in Gyna @realDonaldTrump #DowJones
5620 2018-02-02 20:08:06 Remember the 2011 week where we had a nice selloff but nothing bad for the week and stocks closed down hard on Friday right on a trend line everyone was watching then Mon-Tues everyone caught long and stocks imploded?
5621 2018-02-02 20:08:02 @CNBC just mentioned #MemoDay release as minor impact as possible concern of stock market sell-off buyers sitting on hands for political reasons Sunday talk shows may be resignations in addition to Fed & Fang stocks notwithstanding good jobs report will take another look Monday!
5622 2018-02-02 20:07:50 34,200 $ES_F sold as 2768 sell-stops hit, $4.9bln notional. Also, looks like a handful of 1000+ sell programs in recent minutes.....#lookoutbelow

-630 on the Dow right now.

5625 2018-02-02 20:07:35 Hahaha  I frankly don't give a sh*t and nobody in the middle or low poverty line buys stocks anyway.  It is a false indicator of how the country is truly faring economically....and we ain't faring that great.
5626 2018-02-02 20:07:19 After a long glide higher, U.S. stocks are on track for their worst week since February 2016, as investors worry about rising interest rates.
5627 2018-02-02 20:07:15 $BLUE $GBT Why these 2 biotech stocks did not see a drop???  They are hijacked???
5628 2018-02-02 20:07:09 Dow down 622 points!  No work getting done in Washington today as everyone is selling their Russian funded stocks today!  Watch out for that money trail Traitors!
5629 2018-02-02 20:06:55 The DOW is taking a dump due to hire interest rates. The Stock Market can't go up for ever. Those of us educated on this topic know that. Stocks are overinflated and a correction is due. The memo proves there are FISA abuses, but no damning evidence implicating Trump.
5630 2018-02-02 20:06:45 hahaha. delusional? nothing new has been done to the military
unemployment has been low before trumputin
record low stocks today
US was already an energy exporter before trumputin,russia's economy tank due to low oil prices
Attacking the FBI and DOJ headed by trumputin appointees
5631 2018-02-02 20:06:43 Stocks will likely start to impact yields pretty soon at this pace...
5632 2018-02-02 20:06:42 Mid-day: MBS and Stocks continue downfall.  MBS down 37bps; DOW down 604, NASDAQ -128, S&P 500 -56; while 10yr Treasury climb to 2.85%.  The Markets are in panic mode over the uptick in Inflation.
5633 2018-02-02 20:06:42 stocks down over 610 pts....and still sinking tick tock . . . Trump OWNS this since he's touting how great he was for stocks. Yet campaigned how it was ALL A LIE the stock market.
5634 2018-02-02 20:06:34 I was reliably informed that stocks no longer go down.
5635 2018-02-02 20:06:29 Developing: U.S. stocks fall sharply DOW is down over 600 points and continuing to fall.
5636 2018-02-02 20:06:26 $RY $CM Small sale on these stocks.  Pot stocks are shattered, and crypto is mangled. I'm gonna call #pot/#crypto stocks => #nerdmoney  Nerdmoney not looking too hot right now, but it should dead cat bounce on Monday.
5637 2018-02-02 20:06:14 Take it from me. A guy who has lost nearly $20 on the stocks market.
5638 2018-02-02 20:05:58 Probably. Only thing it reminds me of is that 2011 week where everything got destroyed. Same set up stocks retreated right to trend line that everyone was watching for a bounce over weekend and just melted 5% lower from there over next few days or so.
5639 2018-02-02 20:05:56 nice glad you give it a try ti lightspeed. yeah i believe lightspeed is better when it comes to low caps, penny stocks

5659 2018-02-02 20:03:08 After a long glide higher, U.S. stocks are on track for their worst week since February 2016, as investors worry about rising interest rates.

5663 2018-02-02 20:02:17 This is all true, but since Trump likes to claim credit when stocks go up he can have the blame when they go down too.

5675 2018-02-02 20:00:49 @fahrenthold @SRuhle Since the release of the #NunesMemo, the stock market appears to be taking another dive. Did any @GOP sell a bunch of stocks today? Just wondering if they are making a boatload of $$ on this game at the public’s expense. Do tell.

5681 2018-02-02 19:59:44 Stocks going down because Feds are raising interest rates to basically compete with Wall Street for investors. This has absolutely nothing to do with Trump.
5682 2018-02-02 19:59:35 @realDonaldTrump The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 2 percent and 550 points Friday and was set to close its worst week in two years as fears over rising interest rates and inflation.
It was the worst day for stocks since President Trump took office.  bigly
5683 2018-02-02 19:59:07 $VIX 16.40, UST 10 yr heading for 3.00%, stocks dive - tail is wagging to dog. Will Fed blink?? My bet: if this continues, yes.
5684 2018-02-02 19:58:56 I got one... Talk about the stocks plummeting!!
5685 2018-02-02 19:58:54 #SOTU + #NunesMemo = Dow drops 550 points.   Feels like someone pumping up stocks for SOTU, and selling before the #NothingBurger memo dropped.
5686 2018-02-02 19:58:46 Thanks. Dad left me his stocks when he died and they were all blue chips. I changed out the ones from companies I disagree with morally for blue chips that are somewhat better.
He lost half their value in 2007, regained it all and more under Obama by 2012.
5687 2018-02-02 19:58:44 @MAGA. @DOWJ. What’s going on with the stock market we need it  to come up up up up not down down down people    Even  though I own no stocks or have stocks and anything I don’t like seeing this dropping
5688 2018-02-02 19:58:37 Great tweet! Days after the pandering #StateOfTheUnion  address, the FBI is at odds with the White House, stocks plummet as surely will Mr. Fake News' already pathetic approval rating. Thank you.
5689 2018-02-02 19:58:30 I want to see him take credit for that. Oh. My bad. Stocks went down so it must be Obama's fault.
5690 2018-02-02 19:58:12 Yea but yesterday my stocks were up so much I thought I was going to get laid.
5691 2018-02-02 19:58:06 So @realDonaldTrump, where's your tweet about #Stocks falling 500+ points so far today? You (falsely) grab credit for the highs. How about some apologies for the drop? Yeah, didn't think so. #TrumpResign #ShitholePresident #Resist #FBR
5692 2018-02-02 19:58:04 $VIX never touched 20 since 2017. It looks we will have 20 soon, and back to "normal" volatility mode from rare "low" volatility mode, which means that big and stable stocks may suffer.

5695 2018-02-02 19:57:34 Dow has tumbled down 560+ points in sell-off Friday; likely to be worst week for stocks in 2 years.
5696 2018-02-02 19:57:20 B.S. You are disgusting.  Oh, and I just saw this week will be the worst week for stocks in TWO (2) YEARS!  How are you going to pin that on Obama, Hillary, the FBI, Comey, Rosenstein, the Obama's dog?  Please let me know. TY
5697 2018-02-02 19:57:18 @realDonaldTrump   Boy, Im sure glad I don’t own any stocks...
5698 2018-02-02 19:56:56 Do you think Risk Parity Prince His Ass(hole)ness is on the phone with the FED today? Bonds down and stocks down, risk parity nightmare.

5703 2018-02-02 19:56:33 Stock market taking a tumble. Who will you blame??? The market doesn't like uncertainty.  Worst week for stocks in 2 years.
5704 2018-02-02 19:56:31 Not as cheap as I would like. Excited about correction #stocks
5705 2018-02-02 19:56:22 “Dow falls 400 points as interest rates shoot higher, stocks head for worst week in 2 years”

Welcome to reality you gigantic oaf!
5706 2018-02-02 19:56:15 so Mark, you are touting other stocks in here and now telling everyone a chat is coming for $IFXY ... I think there are some people in here who will want to know your association with the company and how you know of this information.
5707 2018-02-02 19:56:13 Retail investors open Coinbase, throw up. But at least their stocks are higher...
5708 2018-02-02 19:56:03 Since #Trump always takes credit when stocks are up, will he accept blame when they go down?
5709 2018-02-02 19:55:49 So stocks are in a nose dive. Correction day
5710 2018-02-02 19:55:43 We should all invest in cat food stocks.
5711 2018-02-02 19:55:42 Agreed. I'm honestly shocked it hasn't in so long. OTC traders normally salivate over stocks w 100m OS 30m float and no dilution. Ticking time bomb here IMO $ONCX
5712 2018-02-02 19:55:34 Hey Donnie, your stocks are falling? So is this now Clinton or Obama’s fault?
5713 2018-02-02 19:55:28 Yep. Not closing up for me today.

OTOH...

That $SRTY buy a couple days ago is doing quite well!

I see a hunting season opening for good stocks at bad prices here soon.
5714 2018-02-02 19:55:23 Wow is this the start of the market correction? The last couple days i log into our account and its in the red... the tsx is bleeding....... cheaper stocks though! Just debating buying now or waiting a couple days... what are you doing? #tsx #notsellinganything
5715 2018-02-02 19:55:20 Amazon had an amazing day. Healthcare stocks having a good day last time I checked. Good luck!

It’s a rich man’s gambling addiction.
5717 2018-02-02 19:55:15 Normally rates go higher, utilities fall, not today. Rates go higher, US$ strong, not today. Money leaves bonds, goes into stocks, not today. Money leaves stocks, goes into bonds, not today. All backwards, US$ is the issue $SPY $SPX
5718 2018-02-02 19:55:12 The lower corporate tax rate gave Exxon a non cash earnings gain of 5.9 Billion. How does that compare to the extra 20.00 you got this week? #TaxCutsandJobsAct #BlueWave2018 @azmoderate @realDonaldTrump #TrumpSucks #stocks #NunesMemo
5719 2018-02-02 19:55:01 so should i sell my stocks

5720 2018-02-02 19:55:00 @realDonaldTrump DOW PLUNGES 500 POINTS AS STOCKS EYE WORST WEEK IN 2 YEARS!  You fail.

5724 2018-02-02 19:54:34 @SRuhle You know this stuff better than me. Are all my green arrows broken on my Fidelity report of stocks I own or did a few people have a prob with what @POTUS and Nunes did today? I depend on Eric Trump to tell me but he is strangely silent. #WhereAreYouEric
5725 2018-02-02 19:54:32 Who knew picking stocks to put into the Dow could be so difficult?

5735 2018-02-02 19:53:08 The stocks are down because.... wait for it... the job market is too strong.
5736 2018-02-02 19:52:45 You are not responsible for the unemployment rate. It is part of the “mess” you said you inherited. BTW 50%+ of Americans do not own stock. But the stock markets are climbing as corps buy back their stocks courtesy of Trump’s corporate welfare. What about the 1.4+ Trillion ?
5737 2018-02-02 19:52:38 Dow drops 550 points as stocks head for worst week in 2 years
The major indexes were on track for their worst weekly performance in two years.
5738 2018-02-02 19:52:37 Stocks were immensely overvalued and still are.  This is likely just the start of a larger correction over the next 3-5 months.  Then again, dead cats bounce.
5739 2018-02-02 19:52:30 Yuh pretty shitty now as far as stocks and cryptos go. Great tile to buy! #buylowsellhigh
5740 2018-02-02 19:52:13 invest all the souls you get into grass stocks
also, have you tried any other areas?
5741 2018-02-02 19:52:09 Yes,that's the thing, the whole asset management industry is geared to the fact that stocks and bonds are negativity correlated: there is a big implicit short vol position (on top of the explicit one). So, %-wise this may not be a big move, but the implications are painful.
5742 2018-02-02 19:51:41 Well, at least my stocks are doing grea.... wtf???
5743 2018-02-02 19:51:40 Last week, rainbows and unicorns for stocks. This week, there is hell. So what happened? Well, it seems stocks can't function under higher rate regime. So, when is the next QE4?
5744 2018-02-02 19:51:15 Why are these points not being discussed: savings are at a decade low, credit spending at decade high and half of Americans dont own any stocks.
5745 2018-02-02 19:51:04 For those who aren't invested they probably don't care and that's almost half the population.  I think once we're in real bear market territory, people will start to care.  I do hate the DOW though, it's not even a good proxy for stocks
5746 2018-02-02 19:50:51 Jesus Christ my stock portfolio took a beating today. But I am still going to buy some stocks today on the low. 
5747 2018-02-02 19:50:50 And the market correction for over priced stocks...
5748 2018-02-02 19:50:30 All tech stocks have taken a dump and Bezos #Amazon surges into record territory.

5751 2018-02-02 19:49:41 Yup forsure . But I have a good understand in the markets in general it's why I bought alot of stocks today near what I think is the bottom. But yes just a opinion 
5752 2018-02-02 19:49:29 Apparently stocks sometimes move lower...

5756 2018-02-02 19:48:47 Why is down? Why are energy stocks nose diving?
5757 2018-02-02 19:48:43 Because almost ALL assets are overvalued.

Though I think bonds will be saved if stocks really get hit.
5758 2018-02-02 19:48:39 Ow, my stocks...
5759 2018-02-02 19:48:36 If a major correction comes even so-called "safe"balanced mutual funds will not be immune.  Make sure you are protected before it happens #financialeducation #stocks #bonds #MutualFunds #Investments
5760 2018-02-02 19:48:26 Watch the close today.  My guess is that stocks keep selling and bonds catch a bid.
5761 2018-02-02 19:48:07 Dow drops 550 points as stocks head for worst week in 2 years. Who will you blame for this? You take credit for others successes, you really should take credit for this failure.
5762 2018-02-02 19:47:51 If you take all the credit when stocks go up, then I guess you should get all the blame when they go down.
5763 2018-02-02 19:47:24 Oh, my stocks! I am going to lose so much money!

Oh, wait. I don't have any, didn't matter before, doesn't matter now.
5764 2018-02-02 19:47:22 Ah hah! That would explain things. I didn't read the fine print either. Doh. I'll search for the proper one in case it helps other UK folk using your recipes as not everyone can get fresh yeast easily (my online grocer stocks it so I get it often).

5773 2018-02-02 19:46:12 Glad to be middle class, I’ve got no say. Gov gives to the poor in turn they sell EBT cards or by cheap sodas and stuff them in can return machines. Upper class sells your stocks, looks for tax breaks, and breaks laws. Middle class, works and doesn’t pay attention to politics
5774 2018-02-02 19:45:57 Statergy for buying ~
Instead of buying Set an  price alters for 10% higher than CMP,Buy once the Stock price triggers the set target,In the process u will end up buying rising stocks
U may miss 10% rally but won't get trapped in the junk stocks in this falling market.
5775 2018-02-02 19:45:48 Outside of the Microsoft stocks I bought yesterday every individual stock I own is in green today when the market is down over 500

5778 2018-02-02 19:45:00 Today's leg lower in stocks appears to have been triggered by The Fed's Kaplan who sounded hawkish:
*KAPLAN IS CONCERNED TAX CUTS WILL LEAVE U.S. MORE LEVERAGED
*IF WE WAIT TO SEE ACTUAL INFLATION, WE'LL BE TOO LATE
*BASE CASE IS FOR 3 RATE HIKES IN 2018, COULD BE MORE @zerohedge
5779 2018-02-02 19:45:00 Question with regard to $CANN does this drop hurt their plans at all? To build that facility they will need a PP for sure. I really want to grab some cannabis stocks soon.
5780 2018-02-02 19:44:58 Dang, the stocks all dropped today. So does Trump take the blame for this like he claims ownership for other things he didn't do? When is he going to start working for our interests and turn the reality show off? This meddling in every institution shows he doesn't care
5781 2018-02-02 19:44:38 With stocks sliding and volatility climbing, will @POTUS tweet about the big beautiful buying opportunity he is responsible for?
5782 2018-02-02 19:44:01 BREAKING: Dow continues to tumble down 560+ points in sell-off Friday; likely to be worst week for stocks in 2 years.
5783 2018-02-02 19:43:58 Oh look The Rich are selling off some of their Stocks today to earn some quick extra yacht and private jet money! Down We Go!
5784 2018-02-02 19:43:36 $SPY $SPX First the yield curve is going to invert-watch out! Now it's too steep, oh no! This is garden-variety selloff based on short-term overbought conditions. Though I don't think the 200dma is important now as the tax cut (should have) shifted all stocks up. I'm very bullish
5785 2018-02-02 19:43:36 Hmmm wonder who all selling off their stocks

5793 2018-02-02 19:42:50 #MemoDay 

Republicans have a problem with Hilary handling classified info, and she was wrong. 

Republicans have no problem with trump releasing classified into the the entire planet, which is inaccurate, to cover his ass. 

Stocks plummet, constitutional crisis.
5794 2018-02-02 19:42:38 BREAKING: Dow falls more than 530 points as sell-off continues; likely to be worst week for stocks in 2 years.
5795 2018-02-02 19:42:38 On the stocks though, I agree with you, being down a few percent over a few weeks in an up year won't make people change plans.  It'll need to get far worse.
5796 2018-02-02 19:42:34 On a down day like today, I like to look at which stocks have the best relative strength. Seattle Genetics fits. They issued a secondary at $52 yesterday, coupled with the sell off today, the stock should've been down. Instead, the stock is up currently trading at $56. Buy it
5797 2018-02-02 19:42:23 You mean zero hours contracts, how did the EU protect workers from that? How about you ask our fishermen how their industry has been decimated, as well as our fish stocks with pulse fishing?

5800 2018-02-02 19:41:28 that has to do with the stocks, how exactly?  Hmmm?  Of course, when you have NO OTHER ARGUMENT, you bring up Hillary Clinton.  Typical. And sad.  But hey, #MAGA right? Good lord but you people are stupid.

5818 2018-02-02 19:39:36 Ok guys, don't buy the dip. #Stocks #investing
5819 2018-02-02 19:39:16 For the first time in quite some time, both stocks and bonds are accelerating lower in unison.. We've seen occasionally yields bounce mildly while stocks go down for 1-2 days. But the last week has been nearly relentless bond selling with yields up to near 2.85%..
5820 2018-02-02 19:39:05 So you know when stocks are going to be low? Sounds like insider trading to me.
5821 2018-02-02 19:39:03 @realdonaldtrump what was it you were saying?? Dow falls 450 points as interest rates shoot higher, stocks head for worst week in 2 years
5822 2018-02-02 19:38:59 Is this a DISTRACTION??? We all know all the markets are rigged anyway. Money coming out of Bonds normally means it goes into stocks. Not today though. Everything is down - Bonds, Stocks, Metals, Cryptos - this is strange!!!

5830 2018-02-02 19:37:29 and 10 largest stocks are the main inputs of indexes. Until they look toppy we likely havent seen the end
5831 2018-02-02 19:37:19 Finally got a real sell off. I bet Trump wont be bragging about his #SOTU speech. Don't worry, this is whats sup[posed to happen after a huge run up. Sit tight and then DCA. Just adjusting to rates caused by Tax reform and inflation. #stocks
5832 2018-02-02 19:37:16 In this context there are some non trader type friends asking me (today) what to do coz they lost money on BTC and some long calls on stocks.
And i'm like should i block this people or tolerate.
5833 2018-02-02 19:37:09 Yeah, I was going to mention that, like I get you might misunderstand the cage, and not notice the hard points, but how do you see a bed with stocks built in and not get what it is for??

5836 2018-02-02 19:36:52 For the Trump lovers who was gloating about how their stocks were going up........buckle up buttercup, Dow's have dropped over five hundred points and picking up speed since the release of this memo. 
Stocks love stability and you don't have that with Trump
5837 2018-02-02 19:36:45 In future will this be known as #TrumpDumpDay? #stocks 
5838 2018-02-02 19:36:34 His main points were:
1. Passive investing changed the way the market moves
2. Corrections likely to look different. Possibly waterfalls like August 2015
2. If you want to know when the market puts in a bull market top chart the 10 largest stocks since indexes control everything
5839 2018-02-02 19:36:28 A rapid jump in Treasury yields has triggered the worst week for stocks since just before Donald Trump was elected president, and strategists say the sell off could continue.
The sell off followed a spike in yields, which temporarily took the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.85 pct

5844 2018-02-02 19:35:48 Interest rates are rising just in time to reward all the savers who over the last year capitulated and moved out of cash and into stocks.

5855 2018-02-02 19:33:46 There was a point when the Russian front was opened. There is a story there, but that decision lost Germany the war. They couldn't operate on two fronts and abandoned invasion plans. Actually it was a time when British fighter stocks were very depleted. Very dodgy for us.

5857 2018-02-02 19:33:09 The Dow (not representative of all stocks) is down 550 points. I haven’t seen the likes of that in a while (I know that’s like 1.75%). For a number that is representative of most companies, the S&P is down about a similar percentage.
5858 2018-02-02 19:32:55 Dallas Fed President Kaplan moves stocks lower, Dow falls 500 points so far: says could be more than 3 rate hikes this year.
5859 2018-02-02 19:32:39 If you look at the market, most credible stocks and funds are trading at their 52 week highs or all time highs. A correction of some kind is bound to happen.
5860 2018-02-02 19:32:37 .@RBReich .@realDonaldTrump The Beautiful Dow dropped over 500 points today! It's the biggest drop EVER! Believe me! I made stocks cheaper so everyone can buy stocks for much less than they cost last week, but only my Friends at Fox are giving me credit. Sad. Very Stable Genius
5861 2018-02-02 19:32:36 Finally. Bring this b!tch down. I love dirt cheap stocks.

5869 2018-02-02 19:32:00 Trump just wanted to create some buying opportunities for his wealthy patrons by putting all the stocks on sale.
5870 2018-02-02 19:31:57 I don’t see you talking about the stocks today, i guess they didn’t take it too kind to your decision on releasing the memo which was a duh
5871 2018-02-02 19:31:50 Maybe if @PressSec frowns hard enough it'll scare stocks back up.
5872 2018-02-02 19:31:49 @DowJones drops the most it has dropped in a day since the start of your time as @POTUS one day after you and your @GOP lapdogs release #NunesMemo. Worst week for stocks in ~2 years, but I doubt you'll ever speak about that.

5906 2018-02-02 19:28:13 Stocks go up up up up, absolute silence from Trump haters. A severe one day correction and all of a sudden they’re gleefully watching the numbers go down. Do they understand why? Of course not. It means whatever they want it to mean. There is no honesty within them.
5907 2018-02-02 19:28:11 Trump just broke the stock market by releasing this dumb memo! Sell your stocks while you can still keep a profit! #Timber #TheGreatStockCrashOf2018

5941 2018-02-02 19:22:37 Yeah. Ateman and Ito are the two stocks I'm expecting to go up after the combine. Which might put them in positions to be taken while we have other needs to fill. I'll definitely be updating after the combine to see how things change.

6035 2018-02-02 19:01:15 ... as the labor market finally tightens up. Tax cuts have already been priced into the markets for a while now. Stocks are dropping as interest rates spike, and if that continues then stocks should remain suppressed.
6036 2018-02-02 19:01:09 what do you make of stocks selling off recently yet bonds continue to get crushed?
6037 2018-02-02 19:01:08 No idea what you are saying here. TWTR always on my list. And I gave PT for it multiple times already. Check my twit one by one before Lee jumping into judgment. And my list updated regularly but for every time period I only focus on about 10 stocks.
6038 2018-02-02 19:01:02 Pay cut here, hundreds of employees.  And please also take credit for the drop in stocks too.
6039 2018-02-02 19:00:25 Stocks fell 500 points this week even a Stable Genius would figure that's not good.
6040 2018-02-02 18:59:51 I just get paranoid i’m gonna mess something up bc i have stocks also.. it can’t be THAT hard
6041 2018-02-02 18:58:08 Stocks that are holding up:

NFLX AMZN SQ HMNY NTES ANET SAGE
6042 2018-02-02 18:57:53 Says 10 bagger* lol like finding stocks with the most explosive potential
6043 2018-02-02 18:57:52 Dow falls 450 points as interest rates shoot higher, stocks head for worst week in 2 years. #ThanksTrump #somuchwinning
6044 2018-02-02 18:56:37 Stocks are taking a breather from the Trump advance.  Buying opportunity?
6045 2018-02-02 18:56:11 Will President Shythole take any responsibility for this?
Ponzi scheme.
The top market people will dump stocks and come back for the upswing now that their capital gains are softer.
6046 2018-02-02 18:55:48 @realDonaldTrump would you like to take credit? Dow falls 450 points as interest rates shoot higher, stocks head for worst week in 2 years
6047 2018-02-02 18:55:37 If I had more capital I’d be on @facebook stocks right now !!!
6048 2018-02-02 18:55:13 Oh now you wanna talk stocks... 
6049 2018-02-02 18:54:48 Yeah.  It’s a “watch it” theory. I would like them to not be correlated but I think they maybe. Ugh. More data meeded. It does matter what stocks do. We agree
6050 2018-02-02 18:54:26 Many have a plan to buy. Most don't have a plan to sell.  Do you? We teach both plans. #stocks #investing
6051 2018-02-02 18:54:24 $GE is the lone survivor of the original 12 dow stocks from when the index was formed in 1896. Word on the street is they might get the boot
6052 2018-02-02 18:53:55 What a cracking finish it was on #N4P today. I first bought this one when it was ONZ in March 2016. Patience doesn't always pay but with AIM it's always about trying to see the potential on stocks early doors which might just go against the grain 
6053 2018-02-02 18:53:21 Show me one person running who doesn't have stocks or mutual funds.
6054 2018-02-02 18:53:18 Stocks are doing shitty and Adam scared me so I withdrew my money but he’s like “you gotta ride the wave” 



U right man, u right
6055 2018-02-02 18:53:05 Wait, are you comparing holding long-term growth stocks with trading cryptos? Really? Wonder if many of P.L.'s picks had 62% corrections. Doubt it very much.
6056 2018-02-02 18:52:54 Whoop dee do. You don’t have a 401k, do you? Stocks took a massive hit this week. If you have a 401k, you lost thousands this week. $70 is temporary chump change.
6057 2018-02-02 18:52:53 U.S. STOCKS FALL FURTHER; DOW JONES NOW DOWN MORE THAN 450 POINTS
6058 2018-02-02 18:52:38 U.S. STOCKS FALL FURTHER; DOW JONES NOW DOWN MORE THAN 450 POINTS
6059 2018-02-02 18:52:31 Hey @NRA LEAVE SLIDE FIRE STOCKS ALONE! #DontTreadOnMe
6060 2018-02-02 18:52:31 The Stock Market is headed for its worst week in 2 years. Thanks Trump. #Business #Stocks
6061 2018-02-02 18:52:05 There is no data to support BTC as a safe haven.  In fact, it’s correlated with stocks, based on few data we have.  So this is a live theory but I think all assets will get punted, when stocks start to decay soon.
6062 2018-02-02 18:52:01 Some Massive Blocks Hitting random stocks
6063 2018-02-02 18:51:56 I AM BETTINA
6064 2018-02-02 18:51:50 Dow down nearly 500 now and stocks never bottom on Friday’s!      Monday could be meltdown!!!
6065 2018-02-02 18:51:37 Stocks on fire $AKER
6066 2018-02-02 18:50:59 Nobody knows how to short stocks anymore :) This dip is prob. gonna be bought.
6067 2018-02-02 18:50:48 allowing everyone to buy stocks cheaper
6068 2018-02-02 18:50:44 Most in the stock world all agreed; be careful with gloating during uprising of stocks, because what goes up must come down. Pushing 500 points today.
6069 2018-02-02 18:50:23 Shouldn’t you wait till the Democrats Release Their Memo? Fair is Fair. Remembering I told you to SELL YOUR STOCKS LAST WEEK. DOW Down 500 Points! Trumps Presidency will Destroy our Stable Economy.
6070 2018-02-02 18:50:13 #UPDATE #stocks losses accelerate #Dow is down 455 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
6071 2018-02-02 18:49:52 Thanks for the heads up. But knowing the trend in the stocks my broader picks out of the list you have put out here would be MCX, Lic Hsg Finance and Fortis to name 3 as of now
6072 2018-02-02 18:49:35 Stocks are on sale today, mofos!
6073 2018-02-02 18:48:34 We let the market "talk to us." Our job, "Listen." #stocks
6074 2018-02-02 18:48:02 Is the  "Nunes Memo" bad just because it made the stock market drop one day? Should we protect the 'wrongdoers' in the hope that stocks go up?
6075 2018-02-02 18:47:28 For anyone with 1 million$, just invest in rental properties, dividend paying stocks and mutual funds and make a 10% per year which comes out to be 100,000$, enough for an average Joe to live life easily
6076 2018-02-02 18:46:56 If you really call yourself fair and balanced, shouldn’t you wait till the Democrats Release Their Memo?? I told your viewers to SELL THIER STOCKS LAST WEEK! DOW DOWN 500 Points
6077 2018-02-02 18:46:45 If it goes below 5$ it must go for over the counter stocks. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is internal buyback to avoid it going over the counter
6078 2018-02-02 18:46:39 market today having bath in a blood; surprisingly mining shares are holding up quite well (at least a dozen of my picks); long physical, long mining stocks; waiting for confirmation this healthy pullback is over and will add more; not investment advice just MO
6079 2018-02-02 18:46:21 Look at this bragged about stock market! How many ‘average Joe’s’ got stocks and rely on it highly for everyday concerns/living? Down almost 500 points at midday on this Friday.  #StockMarket #msnbc
6080 2018-02-02 18:46:09 Stocks are having their worst week in 2 years. Don't hear you talking about that. @realDonaldTrump
6081 2018-02-02 18:46:04 Retail stocks have been disapoointng, decreasing productivity, banks pulling in the reins despite DJT happy talk, heavy selling of US treasuries abroad, weakening dollar, new Fed chief more likely to increase rates, and DJT's liklihood of being  impeached or forced to resign.
6082 2018-02-02 18:45:52 somebody tell me when the generational buying opportunity in stocks has arrived
6083 2018-02-02 18:45:47 @SJosephBurns r yu better with stocks or options

6085 2018-02-02 18:44:35 The fact that there are still TECH stocks green or flat today, tells me there are still plenty of delusional bulls out there!
6086 2018-02-02 18:44:12 Worst week for stocks but we are 2.5% from record highs we have been spoilt for a while now
6087 2018-02-02 18:43:32 I thought bonds were supposed to rally when stocks fall.
6088 2018-02-02 18:43:31 You know what I’d like to know? If Trump, his family or anyone in his administration sold off any stocks before releasing “the memo”. The Dow is now down 400pts. #NunesMemo
6089 2018-02-02 18:43:18 @gsharofsky take a look at the overall market.   Down big this week.  Most stocks have been hit hard.

6095 2018-02-02 18:40:49 The Dow was down triple digits all day. We've had triple point swings all week. Stocks are backing off because of bond yields. I know that's not convenient to your argument, but your tweet is very much incorrect.
6096 2018-02-02 18:40:40 Too big a position in in just three stocks. Luck is a good thing. Wouldnt you agree...
6097 2018-02-02 18:40:29 Sick of the struggle, core degree. Pay your debts and stay in-line, banks scream as people die. I'm my own young individual, I'm not your product. We're all owned by the Banks to keep stocks up. I'm a victim as you play the competitor, but I'm a citizen and your the Senator.
6098 2018-02-02 18:40:17 Euro bull come alive now and Dollar rally again fade away so fast, US stocks tend to bounce when the dollar is depressed so it could recover from here  before the close but more up and down nextweek - volatility
6099 2018-02-02 18:40:15 Hahaha na that’s not how this works but yea I’m a stocks guy too. My uncle deals with that shit tho since that what he does for a living

6101 2018-02-02 18:39:42 Sure its great when capitalism profits from people being sick. Owners can poison the air, water and food knowing MORE PROFITS are on the way!!! F the poors! No $$ to be made there, they'll die off, no worries.

Congrats on your fat portfolio of Aetna, BP & Monsanto stocks!

6104 2018-02-02 18:37:22 Lo digital ya ha transformado (es) el sistema, la infraestructura de información y comunicación entre personas cosas y organizaciones. Y NADA deja de estar atravesado por flujos y stocks de información y comunicación. Ergo, solo es cuestión de grado o plazo que TODO esté afectado
6105 2018-02-02 18:37:16 A "crash up" is a distinct possibility for stocks and bonds could become too attractive for foreign investors as March T-bonds tease 145'00.  The chart looks unreal... like U.S. debt fell off a cliff and interest rates are unleashed.  Bonds look like the old pork belly futures!
6106 2018-02-02 18:36:38 Good thing I didn’t take the tinder boys advice to buy into the marijuana stocks
6107 2018-02-02 18:36:25 YES!!! YUGE!
6108 2018-02-02 18:36:10 The recent crypto decline has nothing to do with regulation or FB. It's beta. Stocks down -> less cash to play with
6109 2018-02-02 18:36:07 If $AAPL hit the 50 MA on weekly, it would be the first time since Sept 2016. Monthly showing Stocks threatening to go below 80.

6111 2018-02-02 18:35:47 $GE looks every other stocks will be like this shit in 6 months or a year.
6112 2018-02-02 18:35:27 Stocks that are heavy all day (with 2:1 negative breadth) tend to end that way; plus, breadth is 5:1 negative.  Major averages still +5-7% YTD and they were very extended so loose grips on those handlebars into the weekend. $SPX $NDX
6113 2018-02-02 18:35:00 Yeah, $BTC is crashing, and stocks are crashing, and bonds are crashing, and the memo is released. So what? The first #MardiGras2018 parade is tonight! #GetYourPrioritiesStraight #NOLa
6114 2018-02-02 18:34:37 Which child of yours would you choose to die in a high speed, military style hail of bullets because Republicans refuse to ban bump stocks?
6115 2018-02-02 18:33:56 It’s coming, don’t believe then buy Tesla bonds or stocks.
6116 2018-02-02 18:33:41 This may not be the drop or adjustment that the markets and experts have expected but it is an indication that many stock holders are beginning to cash in on the unrealistic share prices BEFORE someone else does and they are left behind holding stocks at lower value. Expect more.
6117 2018-02-02 18:33:38 I don’t think we get the 10% correction but certainly the inflation fears will cause a revaluation of stocks. Again, no problem with this if we get some real wage growth. This will help lower the gini coefficient which has gotten absolutely out of control in the US.
6118 2018-02-02 18:32:03 Whacking one out to Belinda and Bettina
6119 2018-02-02 18:32:00 Guess it's good I don't own stocks.

6122 2018-02-02 18:31:09 If we have to take #stocks down 10% due to real wage increases, I would be ok with that. The real wage growth the market fears will turn into inflation. And the market is probably right. But this wage growth is strongly needed for the working poor and the middle class. Finally!!

6128 2018-02-02 18:30:29 Haaa you mean the memo about nothing??!!!! All of that fanfare to have the Orange fella and his minion Nunes become laughing stocks once again...all eyes still on Mueller's Investigation...
6129 2018-02-02 18:30:23 $ABVG!!!
6130 2018-02-02 18:29:55 Crazy to me, doesn't even seem like market is down that much! So many Bulltards still grasping at there favorite FAANG stocks!
6131 2018-02-02 18:29:50 Lmao did the stocks think the Nunes memo would save Wall Street?
6132 2018-02-02 18:29:20 I think stocks are falling due to speculation that stocks will fall.
6133 2018-02-02 18:29:04 Crude can only ignore rates, equities, and cracks for so long.  Nice tug of war right now as cushing stocks continue to draw.

6144 2018-02-02 18:26:15 Hey congressman check your facts: ATT and Kimberly-Clark dismissed 15,000+/- employees. And one of the is closing ten facilities. They call it restructuring operations. Your tweet misinformation. Also companies are not increasing salary they are buying stocks back at alarm rate
6145 2018-02-02 18:26:05 Dow down 420 led lower by millennials getting smoked on their weed stocks
6146 2018-02-02 18:25:43 Exactly...I bought all the stocks which I had thought of buying when it was running up and also averaged some which has fell 15-20 % in my PF . Will buy only these stocks if market falls again

6149 2018-02-02 18:23:09 So Zandi who called for market and economic armageddon if Trump won is now calling for 10 yield yields to spike because labor mkt is so tight in a good economy. And it's bad for stocks.

6156 2018-02-02 18:21:09 @ValueTrapBlog hey Andrew, My names Sergio and started listening to your investing for beginners about 4 days ago. I was reading your ebook and wanted to know if tradeking( now known as ALLY Invest ) is this still a good place to start to buy my first stocks?
6157 2018-02-02 18:21:01 Stocks decline and bond yields continue to rise as stronger-than-expected U.S. payroll gains and surging wage growth adds to inflation fears, fueling concerns that Fed could raise rates more than three times in 2018.
6158 2018-02-02 18:20:52 Fraud on the court applies to judges too. Sometimes it's worth looking up their financial disclosure statements. Most are loaded with bank-related stocks. Look at each mutual fund & search it for MBS, Fannie or Freddie shares. More than a little of an appearance of impropriety.
6159 2018-02-02 18:20:21 times, it may set up as a prolonged sustained downtrend where each bounce fails as we set lower highs and lower lows. It all depends if I want out of these 2 sectors and other stocks in case it turns out to be another bubble of previous decade or 2 or like 07-08.

6163 2018-02-02 18:18:54 BTC related stocks, marijuana stocks and other stocks trying their best to bounce off of today's lows, some have, some still not much from intraday lows. This could be round 2/3 oversold condition making for another bounce as early as Monday. Imho, if that happens a few more

6171 2018-02-02 18:16:49 But it doesn't. Gorsuch at SCOTUS. More fed app judges first year than any prior Repub, repeal of individual mandate, passing of tax reform, repatriation of funds held offshore by US companies, stocks up, bonuses, etc. I'll take that train wreck~!
6172 2018-02-02 18:16:30 Stocks just plummeted today,REALLY FUCKING BAD
6173 2018-02-02 18:16:28 They can't stand it so they're saying Obama is responsible. Lol. Not buying it. Stocks went up the day you were elected & companies have even said the tax cut is why they are giving back. #MAGA

6175 2018-02-02 18:16:03 @DCDOWORK dude you sound like an emotional wreck. Bitcoin and crypto is a pump and dump cut your losses you should have learned from what happened with marijuana penny stocks a few years back.
6176 2018-02-02 18:15:50 But all such stocks will come in line of fire soon. Just wait before going long.
6177 2018-02-02 18:15:49 I really miss Mrs Stocks. Great woman.

6184 2018-02-02 18:15:12 Send me yall fav penny stocks.
6185 2018-02-02 18:15:09 Second these numbers are good no doubt but not all that great considering we are on a 88 month of job gains and wages still haven't really increased much. Income disparities are still growing & over 50% of us dont own stocks. Will you still own market when wheels fall off?
6186 2018-02-02 18:15:03 #FrdayFeeling This is not the time to be getting back into DOW and S&P 500 stocks thinking this market rebounds. Better to wait and watch for more oppotunities to do bottom fishng as the 26,000 DOW begins to collapse.
6187 2018-02-02 18:14:54 This is the PERFECT to start to look which stocks are HOLDING UP best... These will be the new leaders of the next market rally.
6188 2018-02-02 18:14:37 Valuations out of whack? Growth stocks always have high multiples & on forward basis PE within normal:enthusiasm too high..,ridiculous every day market goes up pundits are worried. End of year it will be even higher:so what then? Recession? Ridiculous! Check the model
6189 2018-02-02 18:14:23 How's it going? how are these other stocks you mentioned treating you today?
6190 2018-02-02 18:13:49 Phew!  Now that #NunesMemo I can go back to buying stocks now that the market has tanked.
6191 2018-02-02 18:13:43 PPT is starting to dust off presses. $qqq $spy #stocks
6192 2018-02-02 18:13:37 CNN and other media stocks are going to tumble.  Smart people will jump off the falling ships.
6193 2018-02-02 18:13:15 as stocks fall 400 points....he's so damned dumb....the whole .@GOP is just so damned dumb...
6194 2018-02-02 18:12:20 Yes, the MEMO is a DUD. Meanwhile, the stock market is now the most overvalued it has been in history, save the period leading up to the 1929 market crash. Even factoring in the Tax Cuts For The Rich, stocks are roughly 30% overvalued. Bond yields getting crushed. #IStandWithFBI
6195 2018-02-02 18:12:12 Evidence is mounting US stocks has overstated the economic performance on the street. Argument growing just creating a 1920’s type of synario. Stock buyback with tax breaks temporarily raising share prices is not investing in economic activity.
6196 2018-02-02 18:12:07 In other news my stocks are taking a beating .. Do something to stop this bloodbath.
6197 2018-02-02 18:11:55 Time to buys stocks!
6198 2018-02-02 18:11:13 for investment stocks Exhaustion or Indecision is best viewed on Mthly charts in case of candles with BH<50%CH.
6199 2018-02-02 18:11:11 Känns tryggt med Mats Qviberg bakom rodret i styrelsen på Bilia, hoppas har får nytt förtroende. Lite fler Bilia aktier genom Öresunds utdelning också. Känns bra med lite extra stocks när typ allt i portföljen är blodrött.
6200 2018-02-02 18:09:32 Yes , but most dividend yield stocks cant be taken for granted as good. Some may have bad biz prospects and hence giving dividends. criteria shouldn’t be earning dividends. But focus on growth business. Usually cheap stocks get you good dividend yield, but that is secondary
6201 2018-02-02 18:09:23 Stocks down huge this week
6202 2018-02-02 18:09:19 It's a pity CNBC weren't advising retail to sell stocks 80 handles ago...
6203 2018-02-02 18:09:06 Dow falls 400 points as interest rates shoot higher, stocks head for worst week in 2 years. I bet trump says nothing.
6204 2018-02-02 18:09:01 Stocks fell today.
Black unemployment is back up. 
The dollar is falling.
You undermined the FBI.

6218 2018-02-02 18:02:58 Yes true you've got to take everything you read on twitter and bulletin boards with a pinch of salt. Form your own opinions. My opinion is pot stocks will be huge over next 5 years couldn't give a flying toss about a minor correction in the market over a week or two!
6219 2018-02-02 18:02:51 Every bad actor involved in #MemoGate should be locked in stocks while we throw rotten food a them.
6220 2018-02-02 18:02:41 As more info comes out about Koch manipulation of energy market, energy stocks drop. Market drops over 400 points, below 26k.
6221 2018-02-02 18:02:22 Stocks are plunging on fears the Fed could raise rates more aggressively. Right now, expectations are for three hikes. Higher rates also ele
6222 2018-02-02 18:02:17 Few quick reminders: Don't: invest w/ emotion; check stocks q/second; care if you lose money if you haven't sold; and don't forget that even when things go up there are some down days. #publicserviceannouncement GLTA!

6233 2018-02-02 17:57:32 One is growing one’s wealth and the other is gambling. If you don’t believe me now, you eventually will. Unless you’re doing some heavy arbitrage, there’s no info in the world that could give you a leg up when picking stocks (efficient-market hypothesis).
6234 2018-02-02 17:57:30 its a correction in some sectors and a crash in others. Many stocks down 40% or more this week, thats a crash in my book. Good news is after a crash comes a recovery! (not immediately)
6235 2018-02-02 17:57:11 On the other side of the coin, I don't want to hear any BS about stocks tanking due to "Deep State" trying to deflect attention from the memo.
6236 2018-02-02 17:56:41 I would be more concerned if one or two stocks in my portfolio were major RED , but since all of them are RED lol , it just reflects the momentum swing of the market. Correction was long overdue . Call me crazy, but I am still bullish on #WEEDSTOCKS in the long run !!

6289 2018-02-02 17:39:37 Quite low I think. It has to do with the fact that the fund made an abrupt change of course and went from investing in Latin America real estate and into pot stocks.

6291 2018-02-02 17:39:04 Stocks are down because they’ve gone up more or less continuously for 14 months without any kind of pullback at all, and eventually there will be a pullback for no reason other than the fact that they happen even in strong bull markets.

It sounds insane & everyones "drawdown #" is clearly going to be different depending on their account / size... but this is the worst week for the stock market in two years, there are big moves in all #Stocks #FX #Commodities... This is the opportunity traders live for...
6299 2018-02-02 17:36:12 10 year yield of 2.82% now highest since 2014.  White House nearing their Saturday Night Massacre moment should Trump fire Rosenstein.  Between yields and White House antics, stocks likely to see more pressure.
6300 2018-02-02 17:36:08 @pnvijay  Hi sir, need investment stocks for short term.
6301 2018-02-02 17:35:41 How do you determine when the daily closes? Unlike stocks, trade goes 24*7 across all time zones.

6305 2018-02-02 17:33:48 every asset algo is now inversely correlated to USD, even stocks bounce on a possibly risk-off news...
6306 2018-02-02 17:33:45 Shame on you!  It's a sad day, when a POTUS tries to shame the American people. BTW stocks are on track for being the worst week in the past two years. Making America (USA) what again? Stop trying to divide this nation with racism, elitist propaganda, and catering to the 1%.

6311 2018-02-02 17:31:16 #Stockmarket The market sell-off looks spooky in points, but it is nothing in reality. Look at top Dow stocks $BA -1% $GS 2.5% $MMM -0.4% $UNH +0.4% $HD -1%  and all everyone worries about is $AAPL (-2.8%). Feels bad but it doesnt look so bad.
6312 2018-02-02 17:31:06 These tax break bonuses, what happens next year when they get the tax break again (bc it's permamnent)? Wil these companies be handing out another bonus? Doubt it. Meanwhile, they continue to reap the benefits. All they will do is buy back stocks, to further consolidate wealth.
6313 2018-02-02 17:30:24 What is the chance that the bond market crashes. Till Q1 17, ppl were buying stocks for yield and bonds for growth. The reverse(the normalcy) can happen once 10yr treasury moves past 3%.

6317 2018-02-02 17:29:14 Stocks fall as interest rates soar on good job growth data. They also decline because some investors started to inspect current values and found them wanting. Tech earnings ($AAPL, $GOOG, etc) were good but not good enough.
6318 2018-02-02 17:29:13 YES! IMPEACH! African Americans and Hispanics unemployment too DAM LOW! Our 401k, stocks economic growth too DAM HIGH! Future of our country looks too DAM good. #MemoDay

6323 2018-02-02 17:27:58 Yes Obama was handed a brutal recession, true. And yes America was trending upwards at 45 (like always) but literally go into your stocks app and look at the DOW/S&P since last November. The difference in growth rate is undeniable. All him? No. Did he do a lot for it? Absolutely
6324 2018-02-02 17:27:51 We'll get a bounce soon. Lots of stocks at 21 and some at 50. Question is how extended bounce will be. Next couple of weeks we'll start to see if we're getting lower highs & lows. If so, then you know market has peaked for time being.
6325 2018-02-02 17:27:28 Well the DOW & Stocks DON’T LIKE it DOW DOWN OVER 300 Points
6326 2018-02-02 17:27:06 @DividendHawk Hey DH could you recommend some long term Dividend paying companies I should look at. Only starting to add dividend stocks recently and looking for some direction. Thanks.
6327 2018-02-02 17:26:44 Well the DOW & Stocks DON’T LIKE it DOW DOWN OVER 300 Points
6328 2018-02-02 17:26:14 Technically strong stocks down -2.50% and technically weak stocks down -2.23% for week. Period measured is last 100 trading days.  So not much separation. Everything getting hit. #erlangerresearch
6329 2018-02-02 17:25:59 Why are the stocks going down?

6331 2018-02-02 17:25:33 Stocks are over valued?  What?
6332 2018-02-02 17:25:00 Yes, but I heard it is not on those stocks? (Picked in last year and will sell by December)
6333 2018-02-02 17:24:45 Stocks tumble, thank moron
6334 2018-02-02 17:24:42 I guess we are in a short everything mode. Stocks, bonds, gold...
6335 2018-02-02 17:24:12 Thanks Mike. With your wisdom us green traders will get some golden bricks soon! Today isn’t that great either! I don’t understand shorts but I imagine it’s a great week to short stocks!

6347 2018-02-02 17:20:36 Stocks tumble as interest rates shoot higher because of Trump's and Nunes actions and they will continue to fall with the actions from the White House and the lackluster GOP.  #poorpres

6351 2018-02-02 17:19:26 Good point. On the dollar decline I mentioned to some of my investor friends that in world standards even though stocks rose significantly I felt the decline in the dollar should be taken into consideration as well.
6352 2018-02-02 17:19:17 As Peter rightly points out, it’s the briskness of rates’ moves that’s shaking markets. It may be stocks’ worst week in two weeks but we really need to maintain perspective here.

6356 2018-02-02 17:18:47 Don't be too quick to assume a rising stock market from here.  Not only that but the #TaxCuts tax were ”economic stimulus” that we have now used, unable to apply again when the #economy may actually need it much more. Helped boost stocks.  Likely will be very unwisely timed.
6357 2018-02-02 17:18:15 @valentinstalf You should allow us to short stocks in the investment section.
6358 2018-02-02 17:18:10 I write for a living @FuckCris, and @jk_rowling has produced one of the best developed, fascinating book series in modern history.  Also, invest in real stocks, crypto currency is a big fat bubble inflated by flatus.
6359 2018-02-02 17:18:05 A number of these #cannabis stocks made a higher low vs. that last $NDX press lower.  Likely doesn't matter if the tape gets melty but trading eyes spy these sorta things.

6405 2018-02-02 17:06:51 This is what happens when the #Fed holds interest rates artificially low for so long. All market needed was a sniff of inflation and they have taken 10-year #yields up 50 bp’s in 6 weeks. #Stocks cannot perform well in this scenario. They will stabilize when rates stabilize

6418 2018-02-02 17:02:49 Dow Jones sniffing a 400-point loss today as the 10-year T-note yield rises 5.15 basis points to 2.84%. This is all going as expected, as higher rates gradually make stocks less attractive.
6419 2018-02-02 17:02:46 I just think if bonds and stocks are selling off, gold should see some bid.
6420 2018-02-02 17:02:37 Unemployment has been dropping dor years. I have no interest in stocks. They do not reflect me, nor the local economy in my area in ANY way. Jobs have been coming back for years, again. All of those things have been improving for the last 9 years.

6423 2018-02-02 17:02:25 If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn’t be in stocks. – John (Jack) Bogle
6424 2018-02-02 17:02:24 Remember as interest rates tend to go up the value of all long term assets tend to fall, stocks are not exempt. In addition, as inflation rises the demand for higher interest rates tend to follow. Thus, higher rates and possibly higher inflation is not ideal for the stocks.

6445 2018-02-02 16:58:36 Just start and make it a habit to throw some money in monthly or when you get a bonus.  Get a low cost broker.  Start with ETF's or Mutual Funds.   Domestic & Foreign.   Large Cap and Small Cap.  Move on to individual stocks when you have done a lot of reading on them

6450 2018-02-02 16:57:02 Big companies are paying small one time bonuses and not raising base pay or offering better benefits and full time employment.  Companies will be using their enormous tax cuts to buy back stocks and reward stock holders.  We know trickle down doesn’t work.
6451 2018-02-02 16:57:01 Every market is the world is way overvalued Paul...sell the $ and buy uberovervalued European or China stocks? Growth normalized with those huge debts and QE? Yeah we are happy staying over a timebomb

NO REASON why #Nikkei 225 $NKD_F & even U.S. #Stocks shouldn't be higher... Clearly no REAL "panic".

6501 2018-02-02 16:39:52 ltcg tax has just proved to be a trigger. It's just a noise as you said. Stocks are down because of extreme froth in lots of pockets. But now the sale is starting. Good time to start hunting!

6511 2018-02-02 16:36:51 My stocks have taken a really big hit this week. Screw wage increases, I've got a great paying job because I'm an educated nurse (and it's flu season) I need retirement money since we all know social security will be null and void in 25 years!

Hughes is definetely a Top 3 CB this class. He is faster than Fitzpatrick and can return. We will see what happens
6516 2018-02-02 16:35:30 • Risk-off theme in stocks and credit might provide some fixed income support
• 10yr US/Germany 1bp tighter after 206bp high yesterday

6517 2018-02-02 16:35:23 For sure. Play within the game make money. We will see if they pull bids and tank a bunch of stocks end of day. Alot of day traders in play aswell today IMO.

Instinet preys on weakness.. and the markets are weaker then ever
6518 2018-02-02 16:34:25 Yeah when you hear the stay at home mom's at soccer games talking stocks or flipping houses you know it's LATE in those markets
6519 2018-02-02 16:34:15 See how that works, wages go up and the stock market goes down. It's much better for working Americans when their pay goes up rather than stocks because stocks going up means that workers aren't getting raises in line with their productivity
6520 2018-02-02 16:34:03 Bonds have been way too low, dollar too weak. We are due for a strong dollar. Also, stocks cannot go up every single day. Lotta profits out there. I know. I took some last week.
6521 2018-02-02 16:33:57 Stocks fell sharply Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.  Taking credit now, Donny?  Smashing records now, Donny?  #LiarInChief #ImpeachTrumpNow #Bernie2020 #MuellerIsComing

6524 2018-02-02 16:32:56 Exactly. Where are all the warnings regarding the stock market bubble that has been heavily under reported? Economists and bankers are deflecting the problems they have and aiming for crypto. Once stocks crash most people will see crypto still standing. Increasing crypto appeal.
6525 2018-02-02 16:32:47 I don't know about you, but DoucheKoin has their prices expanding. Their stocks are being bought by 420BlazeitCoin.

6526 2018-02-02 16:32:36 Crossbow fletching is outdated and could definitely do with updating. Only the bronze and mithril crossbows use the stocks matching tier. (Normal for bronze, maple for mithril)

But I can only imagine how much work it would take to redo crossbow fletching as a whole.

6537 2018-02-02 16:30:41 You’re about 10 years too late I reckon. I doubt they can goose the credit cycle another decade. Stocks will be the last asset class to get the memo.
6538 2018-02-02 16:30:40 Stocks are falling as we speak. Inflation has been approved by Dictator Trump and interest rates are rising in four hours. All this from the Nunes Memo. If CA votes for that fat Ugly Pug again they deserve another Forest Fire. Because this Country will burn up from him.

6543 2018-02-02 16:29:16 I dreamt last night that a STL local was doing stocks for lives, where you could sacrifice a random person in your life for an extra stock. I beat @DrystanDW in grands only because he killed 16 friends and family and felt so guilty he DQ'd himself.
6544 2018-02-02 16:29:12 Remember Comrade I'm a Russian bot. We're in this together to subvert an election and delegitimize a sitting POTUS. Try harder cause it's not working. USA is enjoying greatest economic boom since 911. Economy, 401k, stocks, all growing. Unemployment record lows. Fix it Comrade!!!
6545 2018-02-02 16:29:01 The shortsightedness of Wall St can be amazing. Crushing energy stocks for their 4th Q earnings with oil in low 50's and totally ignoring the 1st Q earnings coming with oil in mid 60's for most of the quarter. Great 4th Q to 1st Q comps coming. Let the discounting mechanism begin
6546 2018-02-02 16:28:46 Stocks are falling because of uncertian investment into bonuses. Pensions. Health plan by corp.

6555 2018-02-02 16:26:31 Look at the charts of several pot stocks and cryptos from November until today. Moving in sync. With 200sma test and strong reaction today from $BTC #Bitcoin it appears an intermediate term bottom may in or nearing for pot stocks.
6556 2018-02-02 16:25:24 The rest of the world loves the socks, but not the stocks
6557 2018-02-02 16:25:22 ah, I never watch those penny stocks, gotta look everywhere to find that "one" trade lol
6558 2018-02-02 16:25:22 The true Trump effect on the market has been bloating which usually is followed by a correction, a downturn (today) and concerns in the bond market that signal bigger issues with stocks.  Maybe you should study up, get the truth, before you send out notifications like this.

6560 2018-02-02 16:24:41 Nonsensical or not, pot stocks have a high correlation to crypto. Capitulation in both markets today to key moving averages. Parabolic run up similar as well.

6569 2018-02-02 16:22:26 Same, no need to panic when you aren't trying to get rich in the first month of investment.  95% of people investing don't understand the fundamentals of stocks
6570 2018-02-02 16:22:08 Yup, so are almost all stocks. Except Amazon & Shopify. Hmm where have I heard those names before 
6571 2018-02-02 16:22:02 $PI a reminder of downside of concept stocks- valuation never really made much sense- off a cool 45% today...

6573 2018-02-02 16:21:47 @realDonaldTrump hey Donald, the stocks are tanking.below 25k, that’s -300,-600 and right now -328 this week
6574 2018-02-02 16:21:17 what's your "it's crashing!" definition?  i think stocks -50% in a few weeks qualifies, your thoughts??
6575 2018-02-02 16:21:17 what do you get when you mix a WILDLY soaring set of stocks with a slew of brand new ETFs in the space?  answer: a peak

6583 2018-02-02 16:19:43 they believe if stocks market correct the global economy fades/collapses or they want to make themselves indispensable or they haven't a clue what to do next and won'r risk the former to jeopardize the later or some other madness is at work?
6584 2018-02-02 16:19:40 Not just fat look at all stocks it's the sector correction but everything is bouncing off the lows. So this tells me the bottom is in the markets . Now we all wait for the next leg up

6591 2018-02-02 16:16:49 Taxing retail investors who put thier hard earned post tax savings into Equity mfs and stocks to earn decent returns which are “must haves” to meet life goals is just disgusting @narendramodi , we dont want freebies but dont screw us everytime #budget2018 #LTCGTax
6592 2018-02-02 16:16:22 I'm thinking the rich are deliberately selling off stocks to turn the market to blame it on Trump when we had job growth in January with 200,000 more jobs.
6593 2018-02-02 16:16:19 Stocks are taking a dive also.
6594 2018-02-02 16:16:03 Yea. Can't remember the iPhone 7 packaging but I know my iPhone X and AirPods had next to no plastic use. As I say, I think this is just them running down their stocks of older packaging, or just simply not changing it as it's just not worth spending any more money on the iPods.

6602 2018-02-02 16:13:42 What if paying it off required I withdrawal all my stocks though?
6603 2018-02-02 16:13:40 My opinion is that most stocks are overvalued so I’d sit tight for a pullback but with stocks like $nflx you never know!
6604 2018-02-02 16:13:27 @CNBC Really, "Trading Nation" teaser, "stocks are crashing", IRRESPONSIBLE

6606 2018-02-02 16:12:50 Syria is rapidly on it's way to becoming another 'weapons of mass destruction'. GOP/Trump won't be happy until there are wars everywhere (defense stocks need a boost?).
6607 2018-02-02 16:12:43 Hey weasel trump the stocks plummet 300 points thats also Thanks to you right? 
Or is itt Somebody else s fault?
6608 2018-02-02 16:12:31 Speedy recovery
6609 2018-02-02 16:12:30 Obviously Stocks crashed, as it was  a Pakoda (Farmers) Budget and not Spectrum (PC's).  It will take care of Hunger.
6610 2018-02-02 16:12:29 Mostly the same stocks I've been recently buying and writing about. But I've noted quite a few times over the last year or so that I'm no longer aggressively buying stocks. I may invest a bit before February ends, though. Best of luck!
6611 2018-02-02 16:12:14 I suspect if that "Memo" shows up, stocks will fall from here, and if it's AWOL or delayed, stocks will rebound
6612 2018-02-02 16:11:47 Stocks are in a free fall today
6613 2018-02-02 16:11:25 50% of americans do not own any stocks. the booming stock market does not help them in this economy. 90% of stocks are owned by 10% of stock holders. booming market does not markedly help most americans.  I care that it looks like hooverville on the streets of every city.
6614 2018-02-02 16:11:12 @narendramodi Sir,please remove STT on stocks as you already levied GST & LTCG in stock market.
6615 2018-02-02 16:10:10 Again as Ray Dalio points out, most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they empathize with (like what is happening today with stocks & crypto).

But they are ignoring the greater good that a market correction needs for long term success.
6616 2018-02-02 16:09:50 This week in the Dow does not reflect an economic downturn.  To the contrary, the Dow has reacted to RISING Treasury yields, which has investors more willing to allocate their investments there rather than in stocks.

Complicated stuff, I know.

6621 2018-02-02 16:08:30 The 10-year USA bond yield going up so rapidly has analysts re-adjusting their valuation models for all assets.

Walking the sideline observing the action, generally the best course of action.

Tread carefully. Buy stocks that fall that you know well. Buy in smaller quantities.
6622 2018-02-02 16:08:29 I used to watch my mother and my uncle play a #boardgame called Stocks and Bonds. I was very young, but I loved watching them even if I never understood what was going on. I miss watching them play.

6624 2018-02-02 16:08:26 Gtfoh...u already knew all them HS kids know nothing about investing other that flipping sneaks for a few bucks so it makes sense to buy more. Stocks like Apple and amazon weren’t always the best out there but eventually they made out better than all of their competitors

6654 2018-02-02 16:07:10 yup..  my stocks dont move up as much as "I think" they should as the market rallies and skyrockets.  but upon any down days (or weeks) my stocks seem to crash down much more..

6664 2018-02-02 16:04:09 @PMO_India @arunjaitley treating equity/stocks and MF is not fair. In recent times Indians started investing in MF especially through SIP's. Now with LTCG, we are asking them to switch back to investing in Realestate, Gold etc. MF's should have taxed 5% and stocks 10%.
6665 2018-02-02 16:03:57 28 out of 30 stocks of DOW are red - first time i see this broad sell-off for a while

6667 2018-02-02 16:03:29 As interest rates on bonds go up, the prices on stocks will decrease - this is normal #markets #stocks #StockMarket
6668 2018-02-02 16:03:07 Interest rates are rising way too fast.  They act as gravity on the discounted cash flow valuation of stocks. IOW, good target for now. Keep eye on rates.

6677 2018-02-02 16:00:26 Yes I agree. But I dont think it'll fetch a lot of returns. Infact money will again flow out to property. Maybe they want to control inflow in stocks to ensure people don't lose in the bull run

6823 2018-02-02 15:36:54 The extreme negative correlation? -0.88/-0.89. Weaker dollar seen as driving inflation higher and thereby bond yields higher. e.g. After ISM price index yest, dollar dumped immediately, then 10Y/30Y prices fell 15mins later. Higher yields and stocks not good friends at extremes.

6837 2018-02-02 15:34:00 Stock market prices reflects emotion.  It's profit taking time, then wait for stocks to bottom out, then buy again.  Rinse repeat. Besides, it only affects the top 20% of the population, the bottom 80% no impact, except lower interest rates.  Inflation is the driver.
6838 2018-02-02 15:33:59 Everything down: Stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Cash is king today. I did nibble at some $VTI, $VXUS, $AMZA and some big name crypto. Watching with dry powder at the ready. If China isn’t buying our bonds, watch out. Yields will rise.
6839 2018-02-02 15:33:47 Cohn's comment watching bond market and the US always wants a stronger $$$ should not be ignored. He knows the correlation between a weaker $ and lower bonds and stocks. There will now be a shift in US administrations $ comments going forward and may mark a bottom for the $$$

6854 2018-02-02 15:30:20 Charts of marijuana stocks are looking downright dangerous. When stocks trade on air and hype there is nothing to support them when the greater fool stops buying. Lots of people will be hurt as most holders are emotionally attached and will not even consider selling.

Now 10452 is good support. We may see 10000 too if close below 10452. So focus only on fundamentally strong stocks and sit relax. Enjoy your weekend. 
6859 2018-02-02 15:28:53 So If you are sitting with good fundamentally strong stocks need not to worry, and keep investing. Take a benifit of every dip. You will get many good opportunities to earn good money but first let the market settle down.

6874 2018-02-02 15:26:33 So basically normal people don't trade stocks. I understand that, but what's messing with my head is unless I have a certain amount of money, or if I LOSE a certain amount I have to pay a much larger percentage than if I had upwards of like 100k or something.

6890 2018-02-02 15:22:31 I’m over here just quietly adding to what’s been working and cutting what hasn’t been working.  These pullbacks show where the strength is.  If your stocks were weak into strength, they’re probably getting HAMMERED here.  Why are you holding them?

6919 2018-02-02 15:16:07 Stocks are falling on the wage growth print in the #NFP because of what it's doing to yields right now (10 yr now @ ~2.86%, continuing its push higher). And because it adds another data point to the fresh big picture "inflation is creeping up" narrative on Wall Street.
6920 2018-02-02 15:15:59 I remember how awful it was in 2007-09, as the Great Recession started with housing, rolled through the bond markets and into stocks. Are you 13 years old?

6983 2018-02-02 15:00:29 You keep complaining about me, liberals, Obama( done), Hillary(lost) yet don’t single out specific achievements of trump. Perhaps because while you feel the warm fuzzy new beginning/stocks are up/ I’ve got a job, you can’t quite attribute it to anything trump has done.

7022 2018-02-02 14:48:54 I would see a valid analogy as switching from $GE into $SNAP, but that is probably overly harsh to $BIDU. I like BIDU, but there are arguably just better things out there. Don't you like stocks with dividends?
7023 2018-02-02 14:48:35 When stocks and sectors break their 8day moving averages.  U reduce or sell - then let the market do price discovery and be opportunistic
7024 2018-02-02 14:48:05 You still haven't explained how this is a trade deficit. And we were told that we wouldn't have to pay anything for this wall. I feel, that if Trump wants to build the wall so bad he could use his billions of dollars to get it started
7025 2018-02-02 14:46:57 Isn’t bond sell off supposed to be good for stocks?

7028 2018-02-02 14:46:37 Not sure. 

But I would hypothesize (and it is my personal experience) that it is a lot easier to hold stocks that you are up 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x when there is a 50% drawdown. 

Buying, however, at these levels is a different story.

7088 2018-02-02 14:28:02 Yields. Lots of chatter about which level matters. It's not absolute, it's relative. It's not relative to stock Div yield, it's relative to stock risk vs bond safety. You were up 25% in stocks, so stocks have downside risk. So, you lock in some of that 25% gain, into safe yield.
7089 2018-02-02 14:28:01 Interesting. Because you held onto stocks that went down temporarily and eventually recovered? Or because of stocks you avoided?
7090 2018-02-02 14:27:02 Remember, Smart Money (Institutions) doesn't like to pay high prices.  They prefer to buy (in most cases) at the 50 Period Simple Moving Average. Always look to it as a major support level.  That's why I don't buy stocks that are trending UNDER the 50.

7100 2018-02-02 14:25:25 Thinking about dip buying some canadian weed stocks today, valuations have really come in. When you have things like $EMHTF down 35% in just a few days to a compellingly cheaper 750x P/S, you cant be too patient.

7103 2018-02-02 14:25:13 So if you want to vaccinate your children: Be careful! Virus evolves faster in vaccinated environments und can achieve resistance. Do we want resistant Flu viruses? Hell no! But don’t start a panic. My current research results just apply to mice stocks. Stay interested for more!
7104 2018-02-02 14:25:11 Learned a valuable lesson. Don't trade stocks in the process of changing their ticker. You cant purchase or sell shares until they are transferred over, could take a day or 5.. fuck me right.

7106 2018-02-02 14:24:17 Any update on the crypto-stocks correlation chart?
7107 2018-02-02 14:23:50 Yup, and they don’t spend 90% of the show talking about Marijuana stocks and crypto currency like @CNBCFastMoney has started to to for ratings....
7108 2018-02-02 14:23:17 Correction is big. My Namaste's stocks getting destroyed :D
7109 2018-02-02 14:23:01 We've had a record 88-month positive growth streak. The @POTUS has been in office for 12 . 86% of that job growth took place under @BarackObama pulling us out of the Bush recession with no #GOP help. Unemployment, stocks etc. all trends started under #Obama. #WakeUp #FactsMatter
7110 2018-02-02 14:22:52 £500B extra national debt could be secured with interest payments of £145M a week.

(that's less than the Housing Benefit we pay to private landlords because we have inadequate social housing stocks)

Brexit already costing the economy more than double that.
7111 2018-02-02 14:22:49 CNBC crew.  You do realize that the Market is composed of more than three stocks?
7112 2018-02-02 14:22:06 Gosh no. I am a poor. We don't play with stocks or coins or money in general.

7116 2018-02-02 14:20:40 Also we'll miss his 'did you know' segment of finding stocks whose mkt prices were manipulated
7117 2018-02-02 14:20:19 Will be interesting to see what stocks do if this happens, everyone seems to think they’re correcting because of rising rates yet inverse correlation with USD is over 90...
7118 2018-02-02 14:20:17 Can you tell me which part of the budget is good for Middle class? I am not looking for Sops like many in our country but at the same time I dont want my hard earned money after tax get looted again with things like LTCG on stocks.

7122 2018-02-02 14:19:05 Stocks look set to tumble at the open as solid jobs report leads to more inflation worries. Oil giants Exxon and Chevron miss forecasts. I'll discuss with @maggielake on @cnni just after 9:30 ET.

7127 2018-02-02 14:17:21 I'm interested as well but cryptos is like stocks i'm just waiting for the bleeding to stop, no use for me to hop in one and just take a loss or have to average down, I don't have to catch the very bottom but I don't like holding a bag either, I always want more for my money, lol
7128 2018-02-02 14:17:01 Something has spooked stocks. I'm not clear on what.

7134 2018-02-02 14:14:49 As we all know, pot stocks took a hit yesterday. Keep an eye out for a bounce play but be careful.
7135 2018-02-02 14:14:27 Stocks discover something called rising rates and yields
7136 2018-02-02 14:14:22 Remember... That everything that goes up... It also comes down... Stocks prices doesn't make a nation great... Hard and real work do
7137 2018-02-02 14:14:20 Sounds like you’re getting old. 
Back to resource stocks.
7138 2018-02-02 14:13:34 Very slow premarket. What i am thinking is people busy to decide what to do with all crypto stuff they bought so nobody wants to trade stocks lol.
7139 2018-02-02 14:13:29 I enjoyed #TheTwoBills on #30For30, but I have to say, I felt kind of hurt about the way these titans dissed the #Jets. I get it, we're clowns, laughing stocks, but we took pride in Parcells, and went through a lot of hurt with the HC of NYJ fiasco. Don't kick us when we're down!

7143 2018-02-02 14:12:44 Exactly... who is still buying stocks with a chart like that... if people think crypto is a bubble they should look no further than the stock market
7144 2018-02-02 14:12:19 Well let’s hope for a positive end to the week. It’s been a trying one and there were stocks to stay in and those to run away from (mj sector). If you’re in $Fat, $Fdm, $Cybx don’t worry at all in my opinion. Watching $Dm, $Grat, and $Ime as they appear to be close to the bottom.

Why would this be allowed tax free! have no issue with this if it funds poor medical insurance

7161 2018-02-02 14:06:44 Comrades! more evidence that the sick man of European capitalism, Britain, economy is flat lining.

7162 2018-02-02 14:06:42 Hey now Mark , wait until the Trump Statue is put in front of the White House , while he is still in office!! hahahaha , you know its funny I daytrade on Wall st. and this rally is a facade most stocks have fallen to all time lows , yet Trump takes credit for it , so so sad
7163 2018-02-02 14:06:16 My pot stocks have been getting slaughtered
7164 2018-02-02 14:05:44 Most worrying fact for an individual investor should not be the market corrections, instead, it's the truth that not all your portfolio stocks recovers when the markets recover. We have to be extremely choosy and cautious in averaging with the correction.
7165 2018-02-02 14:05:17 If bitcoin makes a high like gold, silver, the dow or spy, I post it, because traders trades those markets, if bitcoin or metals makes a low I post it but when i do they think I'm bashing it, I don't trade anything but stocks but this feed's goal is appeal to many not just me.

7167 2018-02-02 14:05:03 This probably cost a lot of money, don’t you want a house someday? Yeah your doing well now, but what about the future? Going to the movies is cheaper and a great escape to get the hell out of the house. Hint, stocks, bonds, a Roth IRA would be smarter. Start small and build!
7168 2018-02-02 14:04:59 If productivity growth can keep up with the rise in wages, these numbers ought to be good for stocks. More wage gains = more revenue; steady unit labor cost = no margin hit, so earnings should rise.

7181 2018-02-02 14:02:07 this is always when we get our pullback for the the next 10 days ...then the companies start buying back there stock and people come in after the earnings and stocks rally into the last 6 weeks of the qrter
7182 2018-02-02 14:01:41 I want to invest in some stocks. #BigGoals
7183 2018-02-02 14:01:39 Its how you survive the bear market that defines you as a trader. During a bull run everyone feels like a genius and guru. I pulled out 60+% cash from my cannabis stocks around the height of the #bullrun and tweeted about it. Now at 75% cash #fearandgreed #potstocks
7184 2018-02-02 14:01:22 Dow futures were down about 230 before the jobs report, now they're down about 190. Why are there headlines that stocks hated the jobs report?
7185 2018-02-02 14:01:17 $CVO I love waking up to the smell of a bankruptcy filing and a 66% loss on a swing trade... Here's to grinding out small gains to get it back. Such is the risk of these cheap junk stocks.
7186 2018-02-02 14:01:16 Biggest #markets impact of the #jobs report:: 

Yields on the 10-year bonds slipped to 2.83%, a 4 year high. 

#Dollar has regained some strength in a broad-based rally. 

Meanwhile, US #stocks remain under pressure (though not appreciably more so since the report).

#fx #forex
7187 2018-02-02 14:00:30 STOCK MARKET:  USA stock market may decline.  Looks like Trump and republican insults of foreigners may have resulted in foreigners pulling out of us stocks and investing in their own countries.  Hopefully foreigners will still buy USA companies products.

7200 2018-02-02 13:56:39 Bitcoin could go to $0 now & it would hurt but there is a whole market in place under it that would continue. Tokens (stocks) for companies that have products and services, some of which are great investments.
7201 2018-02-02 13:55:51 It will help insurance companies and hospitals. Medication will become expensive for others. It’s evident insurance stocks are rising
7202 2018-02-02 13:55:43 Could be worse. Pretty sure stocks in glass went up when my wife’s backups were made.
7203 2018-02-02 13:55:25 !!! Despite both a strong jobs report and good earnings stocks are poised for a big drop at the open as this bond sell off gets worse.
7204 2018-02-02 13:55:18 These leaders have made Africans laughing stocks in the world! We have no dignity or respect wherever we go. Lowest race!

Greencore
Petrofac
Wolf minerals
Menzies

Zoo digital
Sophos Group
7206 2018-02-02 13:55:11 Stocks go up & down all the time, profit taking happens all the time. There are plenty of stocks that been dipping all along the rally higher... Everytime a stock has even been getting driven higher, someone is buying - but there is a person selling (taking profits) against them.
7207 2018-02-02 13:55:02 How much stock market money is going to flood into crypto now that the economy is steam rolling forcing the FED to increase rates. My guess is ALOT 
#crypto #stocks #markets #Cryptocurrency #bitcoin $btc
7208 2018-02-02 13:54:22 true, but only to some extent. but it is a stretch to assume if x is not returning much, they the money went to y which is doing better. logical flaw: the market is not just x and y. money could have gone to cash, other stocks, bonds, you name it.
7209 2018-02-02 13:53:54 Looks like the chart of tech stocks in 2000. It's over now, eh?
7210 2018-02-02 13:53:11 I’ve now built my ranking system purely based on historic metrics from ADVFN. Top stocks are:

BP Marsh
Somero
Victrex
Concur Tech
Zytronic
Centamin
Safechange

I need to add weighting based on last RNS announcement and outlook, but happy so far
7211 2018-02-02 13:52:39 I maintain my position that blockchain is almost certainly valuable - but who ends up being able to "win" and monetise from it is far from clear - it reminds me very closely of the tech rush - hundreds of tech stocks (coins) - only a few valuable - google/amazon/apple
7212 2018-02-02 13:51:53 If this #bond price downhill racing display continues (US 10 and 30 year yields both jumped higher on the US #jobs news), then volatility in pretty much all assets (#stocks #realestate #commodities) will jump. It's natural. Watch #currencies too.
7213 2018-02-02 13:51:40 Very good set of labor numbers this morning. Always look at revisions/net, 200k NFP, revised 160k from 148k in Dec. .3 incr. avg. hourly earnings. All very good, DJIA should do well today if earnings for tech stocks good.

7223 2018-02-02 13:49:44 If asked these questions, you may be talking to dumb money: why are stocks not going up? Why is Bitcoin plunging? But the newspapers say the economy is good, no? Can a one day trading course be a better use of time than a weekend course? But they explain options step by step, no?
7224 2018-02-02 13:49:33 Exactly! It's impossible to measure stocks for every individual farmer in Western Africa. Therefore, supply is estimated by arrivals to ports in Ivory Coast and to warehouses of the national regulator Cocobod in Ghana.

7235 2018-02-02 13:45:54 Business is great, for corporate. Nothing has changed for the rest of us. Over 50% of America doesn’t own stock & 10% own 80% of the stocks
7236 2018-02-02 13:45:47 @cvpayne People like me sold off stocks to build out a basement.  Good for economy!
7237 2018-02-02 13:45:45 I don’t own stocks. Was working. Taking care of dying husband so market can’t help me-but waiting my $2000 Ryan said all Americans would get?????

7242 2018-02-02 13:43:36 Late cycle markets when good economic news is bad for stocks?? Jobs report beats expectations, yields are up, stocks are down...This week markets are behaving more normal than many are used to
7243 2018-02-02 13:43:24 If I wanted to have an intelligent conversation I wouldn’t be talking to someone who thinks something needs to be done about all those darn bum stocks....
7244 2018-02-02 13:41:53 JSE losing steam. Down over 1.25% on worries over rising US rates. Since beginning of year we’re down over 1.5%. But we’re off over 5% on all time high of 61685 recorded last week. Naspers down 3% today but property stocks still in the firing line.
7245 2018-02-02 13:41:42 it's not in 2018, it's always been the case, valuations are based on anticipations. Overall stocks a bit overvalued at the moment but nothing crazy. a correction would be healthy but there's no bubble.
7246 2018-02-02 13:41:39 Sell 60 percent if you can get the nerve. Love you Douglas. I wish you only the best. Semiconductor stocks if the other 40 percent goes below 5k. I hope it rebounds soon for you my poker brother.

7250 2018-02-02 13:41:11 I did too of course.  I'm sure many others have and continue to as well.  That is more of less the goal of shorts on IHUB and STOCKTWITS create 20 account and bash the hell out of stocks

7252 2018-02-02 13:40:07 Haha True. Alot of ico are just a money grab imo. Like i said around 2% will survive and be used globally in the end. I think bitcoin will always be the gold of crypto but hard to say.
I have also invested in stocks and the thing is brick and mortar isn't always legit either haa

7259 2018-02-02 13:38:30 Valuation of stocks now don't make sense. Amazon PE going to go above 300. Ridiculous. Yet it continues. Investors in 2018 value potential over actual performance.

7264 2018-02-02 13:37:01 sure,  makes perfect sense to buy stocks when they're completely undervalued after a bubble popped. but bitcoins valuation still don't make sense, so still a bubble.

7297 2018-02-02 13:23:26 I’m going to keep saying this: stocks won’t keep selling off while long-term bond yields also rise. Either...

1) Economy stays strong and stocks recover 

OR

2) Economy weakens and bonds rally

7328 2018-02-02 13:06:48 HUGE difference is genome editing stocks truly have the potential to change the world of treating disease while crypto currencies have been the biggest ponzi/pyramid scheme in history.

7472 2018-02-02 11:39:14 Pocket. Corps are using tax plan 2 buy back stocks; fire ppl; cut research. As a result, CBO says US will run out of $ quicker, &congress needs 2 raise debt ceiling; the federal govt will default on its debt. This would set off constitutional crisis & a global financial crisis.
7473 2018-02-02 11:38:52 I agree. I am also on buying spree ....but where P/B is around 1.5 and prospects are good. So many good stocks around- OMCs, SBI.....

7476 2018-02-02 11:37:55 Fundamentals are still strong it's all about sentiments right now markets will resume an uptrend after a week or so. Prior to #LTCG also mutual funds are going give more returns than Fixed deposit or anyother bond. Plus for traders chaos is going to settle after a week. #stocks

7478 2018-02-02 11:36:18 Sir please suggest some good stocks
7479 2018-02-02 11:35:25 If u done stocks for over 20 yrs, u shouldnt be scared or suprised. I worked in the nyse for over 20 yrs. The dip is nothing scary. Dont worry it will go up again.
7480 2018-02-02 11:34:41 So continue invested and add if you have spare money...for next few days you will get good stocks for a bargain...
7481 2018-02-02 11:34:06 There are admittedly a number of solid economic reasons here too. And 10 weeks of draws + Venezuela and Iran add to that, surely. Plus the roll trade helps. But I do worry about correlated type moves - short dollar and bonds, long stocks and oil. #OOTT
7482 2018-02-02 11:32:31 A really strong Jobs # actually could spike rates, which isn't good for stocks today..  BUT should create a pretty good opportunity to buy around 3:30
7483 2018-02-02 11:31:06 Taxing retail investors who put thier hard earned post tax savings into Equity mfs and stocks to earn decent returns which are “must haves” to meet life goals is just disgusting @narendramodi , we dont want freebies but dont screw us everytime #budget2018 #LTCGTax

7491 2018-02-02 11:27:25 The stock market puts food on the table for lower class families, right? They can purchase stocks on a minimum wage income.

7493 2018-02-02 11:25:29 I'm surprised this was considered disqualifying within the current administration. I would have thought owning tobacco stocks would be a sign that this public health official is not a captive of political correctness.
7494 2018-02-02 11:24:36 #BTC and #ETH are going to keep heading down - that's fine. Don't put more money in. Put it aside, put it in stocks, put it in commodities, put it wherever. Just wait, and wait, and wait, then solidify your positions in the big guns and enjoy the ride back up.

7504 2018-02-02 11:13:38 Thank you, sir, for admonishing a bond manager spouting off on stocks.  Jeff was equally dour on equities a year ago, but you won’t see that in his short feed history.

People like me didn't gather courage to short certain stocks like BEML n Maruti today n yesterday though they were looking week n down today 5 to 10%

7526 2018-02-02 10:57:05 Yesterday, my Sales/Purchases ratio in value terms was 7 to 1.

Ideally, I'm looking for shares growing at 40% selling on p/e of 20.

Alternatively, defensive stocks anywhere who are low-cost producers paying dividends.

Also, gold stocks leveraged to a rising gold price someday.

7534 2018-02-02 10:53:03 The market is being artificially inflated. A mere 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. 16% left for the other 90%. The market will crash. They have been given free rein to do what they did 2006-08. And NO Obama to fix things. #DoddsFrank passed so it couldn't happen again.

7547 2018-02-02 10:46:46 Personally, I don't think it is fair to compare any portfolio returns with Nifty. You have stocks from Small, Mid and large in Mi25 and comparing it with just Nifty doesn't provide a very good picture.

7582 2018-02-02 10:25:17 50 stocks in the Nifty.. 5 were green.. 4 of them were IT stocks

Considering that the IT Index is near it's highs that's brilliant

And they said IT was finished

Moral of the story: No one knows anything 
7583 2018-02-02 10:25:15 #stockmarkets give a damn to anyones political views..fact is that its only bothered about demand and supply. #Stocks are neither aligned with #BJP/ #Congress..they are just security instruments
7584 2018-02-02 10:24:19 Now if we re- negotiate how we trade so there is an advantage for America then we will be in the black now Mexico can go buy stuff elsewhere but good luck with that.  Big picture. It will take years but build that  wall .
7585 2018-02-02 10:23:28 i guess i'll have to go back there frequently then :( one of the shoppers also whined about the lack of stocks of the 'handsome one' and my biased arse automatically assumed she was referring to ong lmaooos
7586 2018-02-02 10:23:16 Yes, much required to bring stocks back to their true intrinsic value  else won't be any difference between crypto and equity market.

7593 2018-02-02 10:20:50 after 1 week we will again rally and we will see ATH and all in nf but the scars on stocks will go only with time and scar on trading a\c will never go i am in this market since 8+years say cycles but still i will say mkt teaches me everyday
7594 2018-02-02 10:20:39 Definitely impact of the long term Capital gains tax. Absolute murder in the stock exchange. So many good stocks which announced positive results trading at lower circuit.
7595 2018-02-02 10:20:25 You have curves steepening, stocks getting hit, gold lower. Even that piece of turd Bitcoin getting smashed. 

Bund lower AND Dax lower? This could be the start of something crazy.
7596 2018-02-02 10:20:25 FOREX or Stocks? 
7597 2018-02-02 10:20:19 Thanks man, but what is 1 lakh. Is it for individual stock or total portfolio stocks ?
7598 2018-02-02 10:20:05 Could be. In the last 30yrs or so, stocks and bonds have had a negative correlation (when stocks sell off).In fact,the whole AM industry is based on this phenomenon, which is essentially a short correlation bet. So,there's an implicit short vol trade here that is quite danagerous
7599 2018-02-02 10:19:19 Welcome to the big billion day sale for Indian equity.
This is not a bitcoin , this is a 2.5 trillion dollar economy so keep buying its hard to get stocks at these valuations.

7602 2018-02-02 10:18:20 though I have to say without private investors buying the shares #THR and other stocks would not move. So #thanks to all!
