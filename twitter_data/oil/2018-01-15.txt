1 2018-01-15 23:59:52 Why India is not questionting RSSBJP Prime Minister Modi for selling petrol at the highest even though Crude oil is available in OPEC at cheaper rate per barrel ? Oh, PM Modi doesn't hear ! Ok ok
2 2018-01-15 23:59:31 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
3 2018-01-15 23:59:19 He didn't "blow it". The surplus was estimated to be up to $300 million, it shrunk because income taxes, corporate taxes, gas and oil taxes dropped dramatically from what they were expected to be. Stop repeating what Gianforte says and do your own research.

7 2018-01-15 23:58:47 How’s your leveraged buyout wothbe glazers going.  Oh and how is your sponsorship from Gulf oil.  Come on keep up.
8 2018-01-15 23:58:46 Instead of light sanding, just use the green side of a 3M scrub sponge (dry) and lightly scuff it. (this is in the handbook as Joseph would say)
Typically you just need the alcohol to remove grease/oil from fingers.
Acetone maybe once a year, every 6 months at the most often.
9 2018-01-15 23:58:43 As an engine, I've been satisfied. We've had tow, a 97 w/ 80k that got taken out by deer at 60mph, 02 w/ 49k when we got it. It's right over 150k now. Always have to add oil, but very dependable, good PG for a V8.
10 2018-01-15 23:58:34 Interesting.  We  don't have that here in Canada.   We get in a round tin either mashed up with water or oil or in layered chunks in oil.  Layer are dryish and require mayo and celery before assembling toasted sandwiches.

19 2018-01-15 23:57:40 Yes, I do! Apparently, there was a catastrophic cooking oil leak at DTF that slid down past the third floor (which may be vacant - the old William Sonoma) and into Barney's. Imagine the damage, the smell, and the time it'll take to clean up!

40 2018-01-15 23:57:16 About four orders of magnitude less than from coal mining and three from oil.
41 2018-01-15 23:57:00 Inno. I hope the new prescribing guidelines don't impact you in any way. Some of the restrictions look Draconian. CBD oil and the like wouldn't be as effective.

48 2018-01-15 23:56:31 Take whole cauliflower, leaves and all, boil in pot for 10-15 min. Drain. Rub olive oil and a bit of salt. Put in oven for 30-50 min on 220 Celsius. Should be crunchy on the outside, buttery devine on the inside
49 2018-01-15 23:56:28 Apparently we are experiencing an Oil Boom!!! Someone tell Okowa  to activate that loan. #DIGagroalliedltd
50 2018-01-15 23:56:23 Received a poorly lit, painfully loud snap from Francis, who tells me between sobs he's at the bottom of an oil reserve about to have his dick drilled off!
51 2018-01-15 23:56:22 就職活動はまだ早い
52 2018-01-15 23:56:07 That oil spill in the Gulf is terrible. Should’ve used nuclear power, where the only leaks are invisible and therefore can’t hurt you.
53 2018-01-15 23:56:07 my lips are SO CHAPPED im fr thinking about putting straight up olive oil on them so these bitches will get the moisture they need

59 2018-01-15 23:54:51 I spilt oil everywhere while re organizing the bathroom. Gl to my fam.
60 2018-01-15 23:54:39 In order to produce palm oil, forests are destroyed. When forests are destoryed, animals lose their homes. Instead of using PALM OIL in Nutella spread, COCONUT OIL is an amazing and natural alternative. #SAVETHEANIMALS#COCONUTOIL
61 2018-01-15 23:54:39 Scott you have finally gone off the deep end. a boat bound for south korea carrying expensive natural gas gets rammed from a chinese ship and that supposedly shows that smuggling oil to north korea is less economical. why are you spreading fake news
62 2018-01-15 23:54:37 Massaging your scalp once a week with coconut oil helps.
63 2018-01-15 23:54:37 This morning I was all responsible and got an oil change/tires rotated/etc SO consequently I run over a shard of metal and get a flat tire this evening. Mmm I love my life :-)
64 2018-01-15 23:54:34 My coffee habit is to not drink coffee. Never liked the stuff anyway - and never felt like I needed it. Hydrate w/ water, sleep and don’t over commit yourself to burnout. Occasionally burn the midnight oil but allow recovery time. Best of all it’s free!
65 2018-01-15 23:54:30 it is so i use cooking oil
66 2018-01-15 23:54:05 And if you're looking for a oil to help seal in moisture the Jamaican Black Castor Oil blend is perfect!
67 2018-01-15 23:53:59 Have y'all ever applied coconut oil (carefully) while still in the shower?! Cuz my body the softest it's ever been right now
68 2018-01-15 23:53:54 India needs more and more such projects to become self sufficient in oil and gas sector. A long way to go.

72 2018-01-15 23:53:30 The best mask for dry hair will definitely be Sugar strands! It had looooads of avocado oil which has amazing moisturizing properties. I don't really have much for skin at the moment that'll help with dryness
73 2018-01-15 23:53:22 Tried everything but warm milk to help me sleep these last few weeks, best give that a try while all I can smell is fucking lavender oil and candles! Really trying 
74 2018-01-15 23:53:18 The first oil well west of the Mississippi River.
75 2018-01-15 23:53:07 Gonna have to burn the midnight oil tonight
76 2018-01-15 23:52:57 Won’t clog pores, great for sensitive skin (no parabens, mineral oil, fragrance, gluten, sulfates) and calms any breakouts and dryness. Trust me in this one.
77 2018-01-15 23:52:54 lol oil cartridges. I'm laughing cause when i re read it, it does look like i'm looking for a charger. haha
78 2018-01-15 23:52:53 So after Scottish Independence rUK will refuse our oil/petrochemicals, premium food and drink. Oh and our renewable energy. Clean abundant water? Good luck with that. #indy #Brexit #brexitshambles. Englands fucked.

94 2018-01-15 23:51:13 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

148 2018-01-15 23:44:05 all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they could use them to increase oil production through enhanced oil recovery where it is flowing slowly. These deposits are used by historians today, but Ptolemy preferred in book 8 to express it. In  (8/11)

Take some big portabella mushroom caps
Put some marinara sauce inside

Throw in other toppings if you want

Add some mozzarella cheese - shredded or sliced

Some olive oil on top.

Put in the oven for 15 -18 minutes.

153 2018-01-15 23:43:44 My skin so dry....I have to mix the coconut oil in w/my dove.
154 2018-01-15 23:43:23 Coconut oil makes my hair feel soooo goood and refreshed 
155 2018-01-15 23:43:22 TODOS  debemos pagar.   Hay algunas pequeñas diferencias.   Creo lo de LN es x IVA y una interpretación  legal.  Lo de OIL  es no depositar  impuesto retenido.   Hay una gran diferencia  entre un impuesto  propio  no pagado y una retención no depositada
156 2018-01-15 23:43:20 You're right.  Maybe lavender oil with a diffuser?

159 2018-01-15 23:43:08 That’s BS! Let’s be real about WHO uses the gasoline and jet fuel made by BIG OIL to keep your limo and aircraft fueled and able to transport your butt around in style. The USA has enough oil reserves to last tens of decades! Quit misleading the American public!!

161 2018-01-15 23:42:55 Went to go get my oil changed and all the places were either closed or didn't have an oil filter for my car. What the heck
162 2018-01-15 23:42:52 Swap ye oil, gas, electricity, whisky for.....err jam, plastic cheese & dandelion wine
163 2018-01-15 23:42:49 Oh yes... I remember that.. hmm.. so yes..I'd make a spray..maybe you can mix water like (rose water, coconut water, etc.) some aloe juice or glycerin, or something additional with moisturizing properties, then add some drops of your fav oil.

168 2018-01-15 23:42:19 It happened in the 1970s where they tried to control oil shale in Colorado and various new technologies.  They lost a lot of money

181 2018-01-15 23:40:38 Selling our missile tech to China is far worse than anything Trump has done. He’s selling our gas and oil to E Europe, opening ANWAR, arming Ukraine (Which I oppose), supporting Kurds in Syria. All of which damage Putin’s economic and strategic goals. Putin’s owned HRC, Podesta.
182 2018-01-15 23:40:38 Oh! They're mostly baking soda and citric acid, some coconut oil and essential oils for scent.
183 2018-01-15 23:40:36 Yes, and many hours of the latter motivated  me to achieve the former. I was even a Mitch 48%’er back then. Gov’t investment pays off. Look what it does for oil, defense, pharma, etc. Welfare all, or welfare for none.
184 2018-01-15 23:40:13 yeah for sure, I feel like the article tries to answer that. Looks like external shock (oil price slump) plus expanded independent recruitment is working in Alaska

186 2018-01-15 23:39:34 Additional profits from it should be 100% debt reduction. We need to also find ways to privatize and shrink gov so when oil drops again we aren't ending up in the same situation.
187 2018-01-15 23:39:22 OIL DIFF: 5.61 -> 5.67
188 2018-01-15 23:39:21 That’s all I use girl absolutely love it. I use the coconut oil is that the one you use?
189 2018-01-15 23:39:13 I would have actually assumed 2 slices was more that 3 spoons worth of oil. Not bad at all.
190 2018-01-15 23:39:03 And butter or olive oil
191 2018-01-15 23:38:33 He dislikes MUFC because they can beat anyone to signing anyone and all of this through success and revenue not Real who are bailed and funded by the Spanish royal family and the other crooks with oil money.
192 2018-01-15 23:38:21 When we see oil in the Bible, it symbolizes the Holy Spirit.
193 2018-01-15 23:38:18 - pieces from Vincent van Gogh’s private collection. [lowering his voice to a whisper] Some of these pieces have never seen the light of a museum. [kneeling by one piece in particular, he lifts the thick fabric cover to show off the oil painting in van Gogh’s own style] -
194 2018-01-15 23:38:16 @Michael_Temer Just watched documentary on your country and the pollution that is allowed to pour (sewage, garbage, oil) everywhere. You are worse than a 3rd world country. Even they are cleaner! Would never visit there. Shame on your government.

198 2018-01-15 23:37:34 Since you decreased the memorial by one-half you all look a bit crowded. Fortunately the memorial will mostly hide the oil drilling equipment.
199 2018-01-15 23:37:24 This coffee and coconut oil scrub by St. Ives is everything I needed.
200 2018-01-15 23:37:15 Because during our lean financial period oil rich clubs took over financially and we couldn’t compete
201 2018-01-15 23:37:15 City actually exchanged over 100 million pounds of oil money for Santa Cruz, Lescott, Mangala & Jo. Saving the footballing world from the power hungry Manchester United since 2008.
202 2018-01-15 23:36:30 @Michael_Temer Why would you turn such a beautiful country into a natural disaster by allowing your waters to be so polluted? Why is sewage being dumped untreated into your waters? why is garbage allowed to be disposed of in the waters and oil allowed to leak? Shame!
203 2018-01-15 23:36:27 笑
204 2018-01-15 23:36:22 Well I didn’t use their natural hair products but I used this oil they have and that was trash; so, I concluded the whole line was trash.

206 2018-01-15 23:36:11 About to give myself a hot oil treatment 
207 2018-01-15 23:36:11 To finish sharing my love for grenki: their only flaws are they're best with white bread, they're fried (but I use non-refined oil) and that they don't last long even if you make a lot. Otherwise, perfect, nourishing food.
208 2018-01-15 23:36:11 半年で倍にしてやるよ
209 2018-01-15 23:35:58 And any oil smuggled to NK is gonna be super expensive.

The noose tightens..
210 2018-01-15 23:35:53 Also, Seventh Generation makes great sterilizing wipes, using thyme oil. I use w/ CPAP.
211 2018-01-15 23:35:27 So my wife first exfoliates with an all natural soap (none of that @Dove bullshit) and then will apply the oil. Now to heal the scars, she has a derma roller and right after she's done, she applies the oil. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions!
212 2018-01-15 23:35:24 Liquid! Basically fingerprinting as for wine or olive oil analysis
213 2018-01-15 23:35:22 Olive Oil freezes at -6°C. That's one cold pantry.
214 2018-01-15 23:35:20 I hit -25 lbs. It took a long-ass time and I have learned only one thing: when people refer to a fast food place as “healthier”, they mean it’s healthier than doing shots of peanut oil. Thank you and good day.
215 2018-01-15 23:35:20 Just actually noticed it wasn’t although originally drawn to the red seats emblazoned with emirates. Hmmm. Who else is red and pumped with oil money.

217 2018-01-15 23:34:50 Common misconception. As long as the quality argument is kept the same, reapplying JPEG compression to an image has no effect, so the "needs more jpeg" jokes aren't realistic. An actual low quality jpeg looks sort of like a strange oil painting, not a deep-fried mess.
218 2018-01-15 23:34:49 Yes that helps increase the fat intake!! Omgosh also fat bombs. I made chocolate "fudge" fat bombs from coconut oil, butter, cream cheese, cacao, stevia ...
219 2018-01-15 23:34:38 All throughout winter time it's Shea butter and baby oil that do you justice
220 2018-01-15 23:34:37 But the Reps love coal and oil, only if they can get more $ then they'll back renewables!
221 2018-01-15 23:34:32 I need an oil change so bad lol
222 2018-01-15 23:33:57 It was responding to the charlatan  jeffress and the bigoted, snake oil salesmen trump he supports

226 2018-01-15 23:33:33 i bought a frankincense essential oil for my diffuser and it smells like god damn dill pickles i want a refund
227 2018-01-15 23:33:31 I'm also one of the ChapStick/blistex users. Heck, I can't even use "plumping" lip stuff because I am allergic to the hot cinnamon oil
228 2018-01-15 23:32:51 Of course when I take my car to get an oil change they tell me all this shit I need to get done ASAP that’s going to cost me $1000+..
229 2018-01-15 23:32:51 Remember that time when the mechanic who changed my car's oil today told me about the nail in my tire and that it would be a super easy/quick fix?
230 2018-01-15 23:32:42 Lies...  Sweated down with bacon and onions... Or lightly tossed in butter and olive oil.. Fire
231 2018-01-15 23:32:42 Hilariously the oil is allowed on my current diet, as is the cheese and the pepperoni, but the pizza base is wayyyyy out. #imisscarbs
232 2018-01-15 23:32:08 but did you get the oil change
233 2018-01-15 23:31:57 No they all chose a big club over a small oil rich club
234 2018-01-15 23:31:56 Could he clarify on "Jai Italy's" presence too? 

I listen to GM ji a lot but AJ presence felt like oil and water mixing.
235 2018-01-15 23:31:51 I always thought Coco looked like she would smell like baby oil and day old trout.

240 2018-01-15 23:31:08 Stayed in griffin just for an oil change and them mf’ers talking bout come tomorrow 
241 2018-01-15 23:31:03 Here's another idea: Why don't SEC tell us if major oil companies are 100% Pinoy-owned or not?Price hike tomorrow all at the same time and the same prices too.
242 2018-01-15 23:31:00 Damned Oil......at this rate we will end up like NORWAY!
243 2018-01-15 23:30:51 Superdrug's vitamin e skin oil works wonders, could genuinely see a difference in mine after a few days of using it x
244 2018-01-15 23:30:38 How about cooking your veggies and meats in fat? Do you count that in as well (1 TBS of coconut oil and such)?
245 2018-01-15 23:30:26 Who will buy oil from a nation led by a white supremacist called Trump
246 2018-01-15 23:30:14 One of my clients was saying she was getting dermabrasion for her scars and ive also heard micro needling is good for them too!! Or bio oil if you were meaning something you can do at home! Xx
247 2018-01-15 23:29:48 I don't have the gene that allows me to drink Guinness. It tastes like motor oil smells.

250 2018-01-15 23:29:34 Chris literally asked me where to find sesame oil in a HEB I never go to. LOL I can't rn
251 2018-01-15 23:29:22 Lets not be naive. In the back of their mind there is oil sands takeover. How readily they got aclimatized.
252 2018-01-15 23:29:11 So you can pay around 40M for below average players like mangala.. Can't pay 30 for sanchez ? What happened to the OIL tanker ? Like I said if he really wants to play for pep.. OIL  money ll be funded.. It's clear what media and CityFC are trying to so here..
253 2018-01-15 23:29:01 QQ Adam, does the term structure of oil currently add to how long the overall market is on the futures? When oil is in contango, there’s a cost to roll, but now people get paid to roll from front month to spot
254 2018-01-15 23:28:59 I was about to pass out at work from hunger but luckily I had oyster crackers and smoked sardines in olive oil in drawer. I love me and my taste.
255 2018-01-15 23:28:48 motor oil
256 2018-01-15 23:28:28 how long do you normally wait between showers? 12 hrs? 1 day? 2 days? etc? i'd say just try to gradually increase time between showers and approach a goal of like every 2-3 days if you're trying to produce less oil
but i'm not a pro
257 2018-01-15 23:28:27 Ok... so all systems starting to roll.  Just trying to make sure the imported cannabis oil meets all EU regs.  No THC! At last! Hopefully this will help the fybromialga community 
258 2018-01-15 23:28:23 Best to not drink any of those special drinks like Gatorade and all those things that are made from manufacturers trying just natural coconut oil or coconut water put coconut oil on your skin and then put coconut water in your body as a natural way where you do not lose
259 2018-01-15 23:28:16 coconut oil but my dog will lick it off
260 2018-01-15 23:28:10 Bring on the warm oil!
261 2018-01-15 23:27:48 You voted to stay in the UK, though (statement so no question mark).  You had your chance to leave and should have taken (perfect past)it.  Had you taken it (perfect past again) you would have been in a bucket-load (hyphen) of bother, (comma) given the drop in oil prices.
262 2018-01-15 23:27:35 GERMANY - invested in Oz-developed Solar IP when NO ONE in Oz would
MAORIS - forced UK to sue for peace; Treaty of Waitangi is why Oz & NZ didn't federalise as 1 nation
NORWAY - treated Oil Co.s as supplicants, now has tremendous sovereign wealth; Oz dropped pants & touched toes

266 2018-01-15 23:27:13 fish oil
267 2018-01-15 23:27:08 the first ad to strine oil with me
268 2018-01-15 23:27:01 What kinda idiot believes me when I say coconut oil protects against the sun’s harmful rays 
269 2018-01-15 23:26:38 I would recommend reading up on the history of holding companies accountable for the determination of Africa. Oil companies have put up fences on the lands of tribes restricting them from their food sources.  And when oil spills happened they didn’t nothing and ppl died.
270 2018-01-15 23:26:34 席指定なし？
271 2018-01-15 23:26:15 Bro...my car leaking oil again!!! I just spend wild bred on it too like

273 2018-01-15 23:26:10 Hell yeah welcome to the cool kids hair club...also tea tree oil is nice to throw in there sometimes
274 2018-01-15 23:26:04 Pretty sure the secret to not getting hit with a list of things wrong with your car when you only came for an oil change is to go at the end of the day.
275 2018-01-15 23:25:59 I went to the Oil Spill FAMU Ques had my junior year and EVERYTHING is a blur lmao
276 2018-01-15 23:25:55 You temporarily dismantle CITY HALL to free up all the canpower available to create a vigilant TOWN MILITIA. You divide them into two groups, marking them with distinct teams and ranks using the piece of white CHALK and the MOTOR OIL.
277 2018-01-15 23:25:52 We found the best way to stop them was making more obscene and louder noises than they did. I have to give it to the bloke, she was no oil painting and both pale and large.
278 2018-01-15 23:25:40 Also goes well with fresh domestic pickle size cucumbers, but make sure you have real good Greek Feta Cheese (Dodonis Brand), real good AAA grade Olive Oil and hearth oven bread with a hard crust. Enjoy!
279 2018-01-15 23:25:23 Most listed previously sold large stakes in oil ..did the steal it for Putin to give the mineral rights act if they sold stakes to him ? Why do they all lie , figure they are going to have a coup so the will remianuntouched and richer ????
280 2018-01-15 23:25:20 2. Doing a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) If Buhari wins 2019 elections what wld b d dire outcomes & how do we cope? Key sensitive sectors of concern are
(a) spate of the capital market 
(b) down stream oil and gas 
(c) agriculture @olakunlesoriyan @Ibilola_Amao
281 2018-01-15 23:25:04 My favorite way to end my day is taking a shower drinking hot chocolate all cuddled up in bed and turning on my oil diffuser until  @callumsulliva12 comes home
282 2018-01-15 23:25:00 Oil Spill still the best Greek party I've ever been to... Oil Spill and Goombay Top 2!!!
283 2018-01-15 23:24:53 Easy. Shaved Brussels from Trader Joe’s, sautéed in coconut oil. Simple, not easy 
284 2018-01-15 23:24:51 Yeah, pretty much. Kind of like the  70s muscle car that burns a little oil, and needs some body work, but for the most part still performs like it needs to.
285 2018-01-15 23:24:50 I suppose they got to the pictured location in vehicles requiring oil.  Went home to their gas/oil heated homes.  Or they charged their electric devices (cars maybe) with Nat gas generated electricity.  The word sensible has left our vocabularies.  Sensible drilling...  Hint.
286 2018-01-15 23:24:50 FAU oil spill used to be

289 2018-01-15 23:24:25 Is he addressing the fact that many of us in the Northeast heat with oil???  Prices currently are ridiculous!
290 2018-01-15 23:24:24 Eh, I have to stick with organic pizza, due to it having less oil. But, I like onions and mushrooms on mine.
291 2018-01-15 23:24:06 Not if this administration finds oil or gas there
292 2018-01-15 23:24:03 Gotta love cooking. Especially when oil explodes into your eyes. 
293 2018-01-15 23:23:52 How come I do t have worse scans? Is the question I get nearly day to day. Two word: skincare . I use dog oil as a protectant. I am being stalked by a man named Ribald Rodney
294 2018-01-15 23:23:29 無意識に朝ごはんラスク食べてた。

297 2018-01-15 23:23:14 Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. But this reminds those of us in the RESISTANCE that we must NOT focus on the in the GOP but the ("snake oil") within the Democratic Party. djtRUmp's version of the GOP is insideous, horrific, dangerous. But we Dems also need to clean house.
298 2018-01-15 23:23:00 But you get to pour oil!
299 2018-01-15 23:22:46 Buon Anno! Happy New Year! A new year is for new opportunities. For the new year we would like to give away 2 bottles of our delicious olive oil, but first you need to do a few things to get your name in the raffle! @District214 @APProf @KnightsofPHS @Redoro_VR

327 2018-01-15 23:20:03 Let's revisit the emo entitlement of Richard Spencer, because I don't think Hux overdoes it when we compare art to life. Petulent children, with no credibility. Snoke's Unknown Regions $ is the spark to light the fire. Who knows how much oil or how many casinos he has out there.
328 2018-01-15 23:20:03 Bath and Body works lavender oil scrub is holyyyyyyy 
329 2018-01-15 23:20:01 The Middle East is a joke. They control the pricing and then try to tell us what we can and can’t take out of our ground. They fear us depending on our own resources more than anything else. What happens to the price of oil when the US no longer relies on the fixed pricing?
330 2018-01-15 23:19:53 Have you kept pictures of your mother?? You look like a *slightly* andogenised version, so you're not exactly an oil painting, drumpf, esp painted orange with a strange yellow rug on top. Bad genes I'm afraid, #Dolt45
331 2018-01-15 23:19:43 Self sufficient club spending the money they generate. No sugar daddy. No oil money. Full stadium. Strong commercial arm. Plenty of trophies. Plenty of FANS. Have history. Big brands wanting to be associated with #MUFC even through a bad phase. Shhhhhhh

335 2018-01-15 23:19:30 Louisiana pays every single profession shitty. You either play ball or you’re in the oil industry if you’re a millionaire in Louisiana. Shit even the doctors make mediocre money here. Sad.

337 2018-01-15 23:19:09 Lets see part 3:
Did you know pipeline is a much greener form of oil and gas transportation than having it shipped on trucks and trains. Not to mention your expenses related to energy usage would significantly increase if we didn't use pipeline.

339 2018-01-15 23:18:42 I got my nails done and my oil changed and a full tank .. today was a good day 
340 2018-01-15 23:18:41 If so, I'm sure a lot of people are stupid. High oil prices gave the govt enough money to hide the failures of socialism. Then the oil money went away (dropping prices plus huge mismanagement of their infrastructure)
341 2018-01-15 23:18:34 Wow, it looks like it came out of a 3 pack a day guys place, weird how being out of the light it still went that way, maybe spores of mould or oil coming out of the casing? Great that you saved it 
342 2018-01-15 23:18:33 one of his podcasts last week he said pretty much of all his personal investments were in oil and gold. I guess  you would have to be Europac customer to find out the rest

352 2018-01-15 23:17:19 You voted to stay in the UK tho!? you had your chance to leave& should have took it. had you of took it you would have been in a bucket load of bother given the drop in oil prices. How much would that of cost you? England makes up about 80% of the UK populous. It's a #numbersgame
353 2018-01-15 23:17:08 People pray for cake but when God gives them oil, tray, sugar, flour, icing and oven --they walk out the kitchen.

    all the days of my life,
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord

368 2018-01-15 23:14:50 This isn't true Jamie. UK has run up massive debt and has deficit plus our government reduced the tax on North Sea oil to zero %. You do know UK is running a £48billion deficit.
369 2018-01-15 23:14:43 That's interesting, as well as being shite. The UK would still rely on Scotland for oil, gas, water, electricity, whisky and food produce to name just a few items.
370 2018-01-15 23:14:33 Good glad you don't like them more for me I love them both solid and mashed and I put mayo on my sandwich every time except for Subway where I use oil
371 2018-01-15 23:14:28 I see that you have fallen for their propaganda. Stop driving, heating your home and buying products derived from oil if you want to virtue signal.

383 2018-01-15 23:12:57 I guess that's the difference between rehydrated powder and real tonkotsu is the oil.

But I also poach an egg and add curry, chinese hot oil to mine, so the broth is extremely rich and spicy.
384 2018-01-15 23:12:54 Lauren I swear by that big blue Nivea creme, so cheap but so good!!! Read an article that app has all the ingredients that all the fancy expensive moisturisers have too  also coconut oil to remove makeup!

390 2018-01-15 23:12:19 His was a benchmark of $1500 an oz translating to a $750,000 monster box. $750K in 2015 was worth abt 2 houses-So mike would have been right if the price rose to $1500. It didn't - BUT new Yuan denominated oil futures K exchangeable for gold on the SGE will be a GAME CHANGER LOL
391 2018-01-15 23:12:17 Goes well with Greek Cucumbers, Greek Olive Oil, and Greek Feta Cheese equals a refreshing Greek Village Salad. Don't forget the Greek Hearth Oven Bread Marié. I'm hungry now.

393 2018-01-15 23:11:52 I find the hatred for the federal credit for electrical vehicles baffling.  Brand new cutting edge clean tech that is expensive and changing the world. 

Why hate those subsidies but not oil or farm?

397 2018-01-15 23:11:39 Give me a fucking break and pass me a mug of oil.
398 2018-01-15 23:11:32 @sortedfood @Bebbrell Lets say I'm out of oil and can't eat butter (dairy), the only thing I have is margarine as a substitute, for say, eggs.
Should I cook at a lower temperature? Should I cook it for a longer or shorter amount of time? 
Other than taste, how different is it?
399 2018-01-15 23:11:29 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
400 2018-01-15 23:11:24 Enough of stripping the lands! No oil. Drilling in tourism areas of East and West coasts.
401 2018-01-15 23:11:20 I always put lotion on and coconut oil on after the shower but isn't that like just getting dirty again. I also put a butt ton of our moment by one direction on so likeee... I smell good but am I.... clean?
402 2018-01-15 23:11:18 We bought ours from the fit to fat to fit guy. Ones men’s portions & the other is women’s. We can eat snacks and stuff but breakfast is like a coffee/butter/cinnamon & coconut oil mix

408 2018-01-15 23:09:44 The path that kills children with drones, keeps the oil flowing, the MIC in business and protects Wall Street criminals, then saunters over to collect his share. Wonder if he talks about MLK during those half million dollar speeches to Goldman?
409 2018-01-15 23:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

411 2018-01-15 23:09:25 olive oil is actually pretty good for your hair, theres olive oil brand shampoo you can buy, but I was joking about using like bar soap LOL
412 2018-01-15 23:09:11 2 hours for an oil change is absurd

414 2018-01-15 23:09:07 Ultra light oil. Basically gasoline. There is no enviro damage. Always the enviro.  Oil comes from the earth.  Organic right?  Such bs.
415 2018-01-15 23:09:00 anywhere there's oil...there's #US military...  US military has no problem sending good men & women to do their dirty work.  They get killed...not the #politicians that send them to die
416 2018-01-15 23:08:43 Remember the days when getting socks for Christmas was a bummer? Well, I just got a Costco box with 40 rolls of toilet paper + a jug of olive oil and my week has been MADE. Adults r weird.
417 2018-01-15 23:08:30 does anyone else almost vomit after taking fish oil or am I just a child?
418 2018-01-15 23:08:11 Routine maintenance (oil changes, etc); how often was it done and how'd you arrange for maintenance services?  Curious about the reason for ditching the TurtlePac ferry tank for the rigid tanks.
419 2018-01-15 23:08:09 Whos brainwashing these young muslims???? Must be a reason these luney politicians want more of them into their countries? Oil $?

438 2018-01-15 23:04:04 Along with oil, Maduro says he will use gold and diamonds to back the Petro, Venezuela's soon-to-be-launched cryptocurrency. "It will be a super cyrocurrency, the only one like it in the world"

With price right in between the main targets and likely completing an extended wave 3 of C of 4, it's exit longs zone for me. Likely early, but selling into strength is my preferred exit for Position trades.
441 2018-01-15 23:03:51 -appreciate the compliment all the same. [she tucks her hair behind her ear] But I think I do admire oil over most mediums. There’s a certain skill required to be able to work with the nearly never drying paint without completely destroying the subject.
442 2018-01-15 23:03:45 now you need to keep on it... look up RICK SIMPSON OIL... it may save your life.. do some research..
443 2018-01-15 23:03:33 Like midday, you pull out tea tree oil and apply it?

449 2018-01-15 23:02:36 - @SBSNews China races to tackle expanding oil spill after tanker sinks. Iranian tanker sunk in flames as black smoke suffocated air above East China Sea. There is fear oil spill will cause devastating marine damage. China ships in race to clean up and reduce harm to environment.
450 2018-01-15 23:02:14 mine already fell off even though i’ve been putting straight vaseline and coconut oil i’m gonna be shriveled up by summer
451 2018-01-15 23:01:58 Rosehip oil will change ya life for the better
452 2018-01-15 23:01:54 Organic coconut oil on its own or with a bit of vaseline to make it last longer. I swear by coconut oil and literally use it for everything.
453 2018-01-15 23:01:52 tea tree & vitamin e oil are owed all the glory.
454 2018-01-15 23:01:43 REALLY NOW THATS WHY GAS & OIL IS HIGH IN NYC! HAVING TO DEPEND ON FOREIGN Countries! STOP THE BS LET OUR Country SUPPLY US With OUR OWN OIL!!
455 2018-01-15 23:01:34 Currently just put massage oil on and massaging my own neck, @jcruzphysique where are you 
456 2018-01-15 23:00:47 rose water , cantu curl activator cream & tea tree oil . I smell like black girl magic rn
457 2018-01-15 23:00:15 Any "I love my Black Queens" song/poem:

Melanin sista with the afro
Coconut oil on your table
Chocolate complexion so sweet
Skin glistening in the heat
Is that Cantu I smell?
Come be my African Queen, baby gehl
I got them Prince Akeem genes
Black booty too tight for them jeans
458 2018-01-15 23:00:01 And gas! I forgot about the gas. Cuz Europeans are stupid with our gas, like yankees with oil - tying our supply to the worst source imaginable and then wondering why it keeps biting us in the butt
459 2018-01-15 22:59:32 Are Cadillacs considered efficient these days? My dad worked out there for a couple years and never saw such excess! I think you are easily fooled if you buy into them going off of oil. How or what was their economy before we started buying and drilling for their oil?
460 2018-01-15 22:59:17 Too bad they couldn't have just taken them all straight to the dump. The oil filler cap was a rubber cork.
461 2018-01-15 22:59:08 I want body oil that’s so rare and fragrant is costs $100 an ounce.
462 2018-01-15 22:59:05 Still miss you in Edmonton. All the best.
463 2018-01-15 22:58:37 覚えておきます！
464 2018-01-15 22:58:33 we are helping many cars understand pavel bure oil.
465 2018-01-15 22:58:24 Really bad oil miracle that had very brief dreams of being mill so they put in coldlights before the dreams ended/before they could put in gang ups and shadowsteps. 

So basically Valeera with an identity crisis. ;)
466 2018-01-15 22:58:23 I got same problem so oil change can wait
467 2018-01-15 22:58:13 I NORMALLY DO too but like I can't wake up and I was supposed to get an oil change for my car today
468 2018-01-15 22:58:11 Much needed oil change done.
469 2018-01-15 22:57:59 SHOCK HORROR. One of the biggest clubs in the world offers one of the top players in the world, wages that he can get at lesser clubs who have oil money to sustain their "growth."
470 2018-01-15 22:57:47 And not one of them ever changes your car's oil, do they?
471 2018-01-15 22:57:41 Not as productive today as I would like but - almost 1/2 finished on Texas Oil Book Four - A Death Wish. YES!
472 2018-01-15 22:57:34 We did talk about lettin air out but this works pretty good. Just need to get in hopper to change oil and fix a few things
473 2018-01-15 22:57:23 I mean. You don’t have to do the chains on these. Some never fail. Some fail st 20k miles. Some fail after they’ve been done already. This one is particularly healthy. Religious 3k mile oil changes.

478 2018-01-15 22:57:06 The baby oil and belt one 
479 2018-01-15 22:57:01 Random fact: I always put body oil on my belly button.
480 2018-01-15 22:56:59 We have a test with a lot of questions, icedriving, know how to check oil etc, do a security check on the car and I got a bonus: when the testguy screamed MOOSE!! (though there was no moose) I had to hit the break and describe what to do next. I passed. :)
481 2018-01-15 22:56:37 When your coconut oil is in liquid form at night you know it’s summer
482 2018-01-15 22:56:17 if they are already dry Vaseline won't do much. It acts as a barrier but it won't add moisture, if you see what I mean. Oil's good!
483 2018-01-15 22:56:02 What would #mlk do? Have gaddafi killed for $$/oil which created a vacuum for a slave trade to prosper or run out of bombs to drop on Syria? Only pick one.
484 2018-01-15 22:56:01 Mix dish soap and olive oil and scrub the shit out of them bitches, wash rinse repeat until the water is clear when ya rinse it hahah
485 2018-01-15 22:55:52 35/ You've posted that your late wife was Native American. Did/would she have supported the reduction of national parks for oil development, the disregard for the tribal lands for Dakota Access Pipeline, or the commonly-used
486 2018-01-15 22:55:29 Oil
487 2018-01-15 22:55:14 The Repubs have given $Trillions to 1%, allowed environment and FDA to be run by oil & drug interests, & sat by while POTUS ignored constitution. Their work is done. We might be safer if Presidency was eliminated for next 3 years.
488 2018-01-15 22:55:10 Girl I have some dark ass circles under my eyes and the oil literally does make a difference. Its amazing haha. But I know how you feel. I inherited mine from my moms side of the family  and I've had the same issue with stuff not working the way I had hoped it lol
489 2018-01-15 22:55:08 Let’s see, you tried your best to kill Obamacare, borrowed our children’s future to payoff Koch Brothers w insane tax cuts, next you’ll build a Wall & Up the world’s largest Military budget - Sir, your priorities don’t match your sentiment, sale this snake oil somewhere else.
490 2018-01-15 22:54:58 Coconut oil or a little Olive oil should help to give them moisture, and there's no ingredients in them to irritate your lips (and you should have one in your kitchen). Vaseline's helpful at night to keep the moisture in. Try to resist the urge to lick them tho :)
491 2018-01-15 22:54:54 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
492 2018-01-15 22:54:43 Gas prices were $5 a gallon for no reason.  He stood up to the oil companies and the Saudi's for the American people.
493 2018-01-15 22:54:41 Someone else recommended Jorie Graham today as someone I should read on extinction! & @theneliad, Rebecca Dunham's Cold Pastoral is full of poems on environmental elegy (book is on Deepwater Horizon oil spill & wonderful, awful)
494 2018-01-15 22:54:37 You can put veggie oil in your hoo-ha as lube? Idk about that life...
495 2018-01-15 22:54:34 Naw, can't be true, we have no oil left so we're told
496 2018-01-15 22:54:23 Perhaps a dumb question, but why are we planning on decommissioning  North Sea oil platforms instead of re-purposing them as solar, tidal & wind power installations? Would the ref-it and long term economic benefit not be lower than the cost of just cutting up and removing them?
497 2018-01-15 22:54:21 When you can’t take painkillers use clove oil! It’s rank but helps
498 2018-01-15 22:54:19 Steak. I forgot to put oil in the pan.
499 2018-01-15 22:54:04 Finally changed the oil lol
500 2018-01-15 22:53:54 Primer creates a barrier between foundation and your skin and if you have anything but perfect skin primer is pretty necessary. You don’t need to spend a lot tho! 
Failing that, I suggest mixing some face oil in the Fenty foundation :)
501 2018-01-15 22:53:49 Hi, Antonio. We're sorry to hear of the oil leak. We'd be happy to learn more about your situation. Please send us a DM with additional details if you're interested.

509 2018-01-15 22:51:52 I've seen this before and every time I wonder: why *warm* oil? Is that somehow worse for you than cold oil?

511 2018-01-15 22:51:34 A bottle of some ridiculously luxurious body oil and enough that she’ll not be afraid to use it. Great for the bump. Clarins Toning oil is lovely or something more wildly expensive that smells divine.
512 2018-01-15 22:51:31 OMG, don't tell Trump. Or is this how he "negotiated" to reverse the release of Bears Ears Nat.l monument for oil drilling.

520 2018-01-15 22:50:33 #joysms JJ's NDC relied on gold, mills/mahama on oil. Cocoa suffered under both NDC admin. NDC's lazy sole dependence on looting minerals means that party has no competence to add value to ghanaian man-made productivity
521 2018-01-15 22:50:32 Might be, not sure. Think I might bobtail to Speedco for that oil change. Won't have any time to do it until maybe later in the week and I'm overdue.
522 2018-01-15 22:50:26 I just got this ball, I love it! If you own a Vintage DangerZone and are looking for that kind of reaction on heavy oil, get this ball. Not to mention it's hitting power

524 2018-01-15 22:50:14 The Dems aren't running the Gov. now! The money being given to the top 1% the healthcare taken away, Education being robbed, EPA being dismantled, private land being pilloried, Drilling for Oil off our coasts, prejudice, that's all Republicans! And on and on. That's destroyingUSA
525 2018-01-15 22:49:58 Right? Oil flavors food all the time and it’s delicious.
526 2018-01-15 22:49:43 Then maybe an oil/fuel tax would be appropriate.  Based upon their percentage of overall use.  Yeah, that's the ticket.

532 2018-01-15 22:48:32 Have to be careful believing republicans! They do lie, you know. Weapons of mass destruction was to start a war for oil, and save Halliburton. They were broke, selling off , laying people off just flat broke. You have a president who has filed 7 bankruptcy telling people he would
533 2018-01-15 22:48:27 Artificial intelligence can now replace fake or sexed up intelligence to wage oil based war. Is artificial the new fake? #spin
534 2018-01-15 22:48:09 tired of not having white teeth? just turn them black! with a mix of motor oil, black paint and some plant soil, you can turn them pearly black super easy for super cheap!
disclaimer: this'll probably kill you. but at least then you won't worry about your teeth, so there's that.
535 2018-01-15 22:48:07 The thing about Omega-3 tablets is that there is only super fish oil evidence that they work.

540 2018-01-15 22:47:33 Almost seems like they want a monopoly on the supply. How come those sunny spots don’t give up their oil and SUV’s and do wind and solar for their grid?

548 2018-01-15 22:46:17 I always leave Uncle Ed's Oil Shoppe with more than an oil change 
549 2018-01-15 22:46:15 Nope. But I see that the OPEC countries sure want us to invest a lot into that and quit producing so much oil. Weird!
550 2018-01-15 22:46:12 Murdoch? You mean the Murdoch who sits on the strategic board of Genie Oil and Gas along with Cheney and Rothschild (among others), the company drilling for oil in Syrian land (Golan Heights) currently held by Israel? Yep, nothing to see with these two.

560 2018-01-15 22:44:00 Apparently the new thing that healthy eating blogs are eliminating is oil. If you're counting, so far it's: nuts, gluten, meat, dairy, sugar, oil. Soon there will be nothing left.

565 2018-01-15 22:42:53 They still haven’t spent as much as City AND they’re spending earned money, not oil money from human rights violators. Besides, Alexis a bargain in this market as City fullbacks cost £50. Stop your biased winging.

585 2018-01-15 22:40:01 My family is like oil & water OTL seriously be telling both sides to shut up.

Because the same thing repeats itself year after year, prediction is 100% accurate

587 2018-01-15 22:39:58 Yay what a day just got oil in car changed,windshield wipers replaced and new headlight. Now time to relax thanks to @jiffylube

589 2018-01-15 22:39:55 As long as there is Saudi and Qatari Oil Money, there will be no peace in this world!
590 2018-01-15 22:39:55 Germans worried about Iran sanctions and their 12B€ oil deal, the French selling cars. Pathetic
591 2018-01-15 22:39:29 Robot comes to the world to find true love.
Human give him oil to burn him inside and make him do what they need.
"This is love.", human say to the robot.
592 2018-01-15 22:39:27 Get some Albus oil and put in in a bowl of boiling hot water, a towle over the head and breath in the steam. Also you can rub it on yer chest without getting your hair clogged up like Vick.

594 2018-01-15 22:39:06 Uniteds money is generated by millions of fans around the world following one of the top 5 clubs in the world - a sustainable business. City’s money is generated by an oil sheik wanting a plaything. They will never be a big club.
595 2018-01-15 22:39:00 Called on Friday to see if garage would be open for an oil change today, citing today's holiday as potential reason to close reply was a gruff "Huh, no that's Freedom Day, and we're open." I'm not even really sure what that means?!
596 2018-01-15 22:38:58 OIL DIFF: 5.55 -> 5.55

600 2018-01-15 22:38:14 You can't honor Martin Luther King while you are trying to start a new Cold War with Russia and destroying Middle Eastern countries for pissing off our oil companies, bankers, Saudi Arabia, or Israel.
601 2018-01-15 22:37:54 Every time I go get my oil changed, I'm asked what high school I go to and I'm pretty sure it's because of the tsum tsums on my dash
602 2018-01-15 22:37:49 i LOVE Pizza.... and that "oil" rumor sounds like Fake News!
603 2018-01-15 22:37:36 Pay attention to who your sources are and who is pushing the renewables. It’s the same folks who have a vested interest in killing shale, ANWAR, and any offshore drilling. Ask why? Is it the “environment” or is it to preserve their monopoly on the oil market?
604 2018-01-15 22:37:22 #joysms ghana's political hierarchy are clogged with unimaginative ppl who are totally useless unless there is oil/gold/timber to giveaway for pittance & misuse the meagre proceeds acquired

611 2018-01-15 22:36:14 my self-care book says along with the Gratitude List I need to sprinkle peppermint oil on the floor of my shower and inhale. Or slip over. Which ever comes first.
612 2018-01-15 22:35:54 Oh, when are we going to put the oil derricks in, when are we going to kill off all the endangered species that live there - although, you already killed off the wolves and are working on the bears, when is climate change going to ruin it completely. Thank you GOP!!!

614 2018-01-15 22:35:44 Because even though he might not be "legitimate" his policies have a real effect on real people, his opening up oil drilling offshore will affect people of color who disproportionately live along the shoreline, deregulation of environmental laws will kill real people.

616 2018-01-15 22:35:44 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil mixed is the weirdest smell. I don't find it gross, but I don't find it pleasing either lol
617 2018-01-15 22:35:39 Use coconut oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil periodically in your hair to help soften it  I put a drop of each into my conditioner

629 2018-01-15 22:34:20 If it is good local olive oil bring it on.
630 2018-01-15 22:34:15 Again,  1940’s America  exported oil not import. Kinda like the present fracking makes OPEC impotent.
631 2018-01-15 22:34:08 Getting an oil change. Fun times.
632 2018-01-15 22:34:03 Pedantic moment: Coconut oil IS vastly overblown but I use it in cooking various “edibles” and they taste exactly the same as when I use vegetable oil or shortening. It’s a funny line but not 100% true
633 2018-01-15 22:33:48 Oil is hitting high price of 64$ per barrel, a price that hasn’t been seen since 2015. If it starts hitting 80$+ per barrel gas prices will be above 3$ per gallon just like 2011-2013.
634 2018-01-15 22:33:42 Nice work! Can’t beat osmo oil beautiful stuff to use I’ve got a heap of doors and a staircase to do in it this week too! 
635 2018-01-15 22:33:38 Not fussed but I just wish it was easier to get a brand that had no added sugar, salt or palm oil!

637 2018-01-15 22:33:13 Did the bare minimum to run to the office to finish a conference submission,  but forgot I had an oil change appt. Long wait,  because of the holiday,  and now I'm wandering the mall,  feeling insufficiently painted.  

And my paper isn't finished.
638 2018-01-15 22:33:03 Please cite your sources for the "tossed into boiling oil vats" part. There were pogroms against Jews in reaction to the plague, but not Europe wide and we have no idea if the death toll ran to thousands.  The massacres were condemned by Pope Clement VI in two papal bulls in 1348
639 2018-01-15 22:33:01 Is coconut oil still a fad?
640 2018-01-15 22:32:59 Coconut body oil has been so good to me. I smell like coconuts 26/9 and believe me there’s no better scent out there
641 2018-01-15 22:32:57 Roasted with olive oil, and a little bacon is always good too!
642 2018-01-15 22:32:53 welcome back from holiday. Looks like the short oil trade was waiting for your return
643 2018-01-15 22:32:46 You will still need oil to produce tires, plastic, and oil for bearings.

658 2018-01-15 22:31:13 If we cut corp welfare from Big gas/Oil.. Gas would shoot up to around $5-6 a gallon.. Like it is in most of the free world. But, what political figure is going to do the right thing and end the welfare?

672 2018-01-15 22:28:36 it's also why the US invaded Iraq in 2003. Saddam wanted to sell Oil in Euros which would've been a big threat to the dollar.
673 2018-01-15 22:28:20 I mean the Bolognese itself is pretty clean:

679 2018-01-15 22:27:08 Opening up the RUK "internal market" to scrutiny would only serve to highlight further Scottish Exports reclassified to deny tax return , a biased trade balance , and of course ALL which excludes OIL and GAS serving to show A PROPER Scots viable economy as independent.
680 2018-01-15 22:27:04 I believe this is why we have a court system. Deep down I think it was specifically designed for gangster type mental malcontents, just like the Clintons' and their ilk.. Let's put some oil on the shafts and get it in gear . Time to haul them up before some Judges.

687 2018-01-15 22:26:19 Yes, totally agree - conversations are key. Not that it is simple but it is crucial, & not just the conversations that happen within echo chambers - we all need to challenge one another. Just reading about palm oil, another hot potato but it ain’t black and white!

690 2018-01-15 22:25:48 I can agree that the NATO allies have been injustly harsh on the middle east in the past because of the dependancy of their economy on the oil industry but technology seems to be helping "the west" is switching to alternate sources of energy among other methods.
691 2018-01-15 22:25:42 You reckon! The UK  government is doing a great job of splitting up the UK! Back in 2014 oil was  100 dollars a barrel now 70 , but there's more than oil to support Scotland and Westminster knows this the reason why they lied throughout 2014 with no facts,

693 2018-01-15 22:25:27 Is that so?

710 2018-01-15 22:22:25 I would imagine that warning is on bottle as it is for most products which have the potential to be toxic. Bottles of wool wash are probably not great if ingested but you wouldn't expect warning to not ingest on yarn website. Why should it be there for bottle of essential oil?
711 2018-01-15 22:22:04 Answer me this... what the hell attracted all your top players to a mediocre club like Man City? Money. Oil money! Not history. Besides, Sanchez has dreamt about playing for us (look it up), so it’s no surprise, he was swayed when he found out we were interested
712 2018-01-15 22:22:02 Everytime you take your car to a random ass mechanic you magically got an oil leak.
713 2018-01-15 22:21:53 Of course he doesn’t want it to effect the shoreline near his mansion in Palm Beach, if there should ever be a oil leak.... so “Thank you Mr Trump”......(I said  sarcastically)
714 2018-01-15 22:21:36 Bought a new oil for my face ....hopefully this is the real deal
715 2018-01-15 22:21:25 @realDonaldTrump: Put pressure on China, take all American products out of china shoe clothes and more. China want yall to get into it with N.K. China don't do nothing or say nothing. You already see they selling oil to N.K. behind baclk and more. They don't give a fuck about USA
716 2018-01-15 22:21:11 Nevertheless  she's using it to help her  bid to divide the UK.  We really don't need economic speculation. Remember how the public were fed innacurate figures on oil before indyref voting. Thank God for the result.
717 2018-01-15 22:21:02 It's basically that oil rich countries sell there oil in USD and in return they receive protection.
718 2018-01-15 22:20:59 I don't buy the stability argument, how in the fuck is iraq more stable than now? or lets face it most of the middle east? It was definitely a grab for oil access. Presumably due to russian pipeline being built through crimea?

724 2018-01-15 22:19:59 Is it not efficient to refine the oil near extraction site?
725 2018-01-15 22:19:46 “I’m for MASSIVE OIL & GAS & EVERYTHING else.” I assume that “everything” to @realDonaldTrump implies blowing up the kitchen sink #NuclearWar This belligerent piece of shit is so bloated w/ hubris & BigMacs #HeartAttack that he touts his subornative nature like a badge of honor.

727 2018-01-15 22:19:17 We think of "have Mercy" as something like "please lay off the whips!" But Eleison is related to the Greek for Olive Oil and is more like "be soothing". "Take it easy" is good in the Lebowski sense. It means more like "calm my life, my soul..."
728 2018-01-15 22:19:13 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
729 2018-01-15 22:19:07 Not much happening at this Canuck economic stand. Have you seen the list of
the hundreds of very large contributions; many of which made to keep Canadian oil landlocked.
730 2018-01-15 22:19:06 Looks like a great spot to ruin by drilling for oil - give Zinke a call.
731 2018-01-15 22:19:00 Oil dey ur head abegg
732 2018-01-15 22:18:58 These folks should vote for the UCP come election time, they'll cut taxes and raise the global price of oil, solving all of these cultural spending habit issues in one fell swoop
733 2018-01-15 22:18:54 The states are doing pretty good at keeping him in check on a few issues...suing oil companies and trying to get excluded from the offshore drilling, investing in sustainable energy...the world will weather donald trump and pick up where we left off
734 2018-01-15 22:18:53 I'm not to sure if irradiating the hellium - 3 with neutrino radiation is a good idea  it makes things like man made  crude oil flammable try just using hellium - 3 if you do use neutrino be aware it could blow up and I mean atomic
735 2018-01-15 22:18:45 My Cajun girlfriend from years ago played piano and painted several oil paintings she sold to different people. I wonder if some day they sell for lots of money. she also made pralines she sold in downtown Baton Rouge restaurants
736 2018-01-15 22:18:34 (puts down Big Gulp of warm oil) huh?
737 2018-01-15 22:18:21 Hmm, I think maybe libya, iraq and others might want a word with you there :) did we need to destabilize iraq? or was that to gain rent seeking profits from their oil??
738 2018-01-15 22:18:05 Find somebody o youtube that of our descent and follow them making it do it old school style and put the fish fry in a brown bag add the fish shake shake it up and put it some hot hot oil
739 2018-01-15 22:18:04 Oil is what it always ends up being about
740 2018-01-15 22:17:59 Man City pulls out #Sanchez Deal can @ChelseaFC really afford to break the bank on 1 player. Arsenal media communications team working overtime #TransferRumours #DontBelieveTheHype #AgentTalk #BrinkManShip
741 2018-01-15 22:17:30 I do shots of olive oil...So sure why not
742 2018-01-15 22:17:26 #OOTT #US #Oil 
Find something in common between #WTI and #Euro recently. Both #markets have had strong uptrends. Their endings are to be similar in terms of the timing and fallout. They will share the same last straw when the time is up.
743 2018-01-15 22:17:25 Yup. I recall the Choteau Acantha breaking the story on the plant being built in tiny Bynum, Montana, for equipment to be used in Canada oil biz. (Tar sands?) Great Falls went with it *without attribution*!
744 2018-01-15 22:17:24 I remember the first time we went out at night.  Full moon and water looked like slick oil...surreal...also realized immediately why ancestors navigated w stars....so easy to see them...we found ourselves using them too when radar wasn’t useful 
745 2018-01-15 22:17:14 Paint fumes and olbas oil #phew 
746 2018-01-15 22:17:10 Well, other than whisky(Scotland), gin(Scotland, again), some oil and oil products (again, Scotland), fish (Scotland), education (again, Scotland)...
747 2018-01-15 22:17:03 #Monet is about what impression it leaves with you upon seeing it. The brush strokes and oil paints by Claude Monet are a blurred interpretation to see art that achieves beauty in your mind’s eye. To be so privileged to have that chance.
748 2018-01-15 22:16:32 A lot of capitalist countries rely on oil sales for revenue, and they are not collapsing (like Canada, Norway, Saudi, Russia, for example).  When government doesn't interfere with the free market, things just work.
749 2018-01-15 22:16:26 Well let’s be honest if he’s signs for united he’s playing for biggest club in England city small club with oil money 
750 2018-01-15 22:16:21 It's actually an oil painting, I fooled you all
751 2018-01-15 22:16:19 So it’s obvious. We need more cow farts. Vegans need to be quiet. The Oil Sands need to be more than 0.12% of the Worlds CO2 output. I don’t want a glacier in my backyard.
752 2018-01-15 22:16:19 Exactly why I dont get why you’ve not bust the bank mate. £50m to your owners is 20 seconds down an oil well ffs
753 2018-01-15 22:15:23 Look Trudeau is coming to Edmonton (supposedly) why aren't you trying to organize a massive  protest with oil workers.we gotta start to step up.
754 2018-01-15 22:15:13 I don't believe in broke boy oil
755 2018-01-15 22:15:11 @oil trash, you are using too big of worlds for @let trump be trump to grasp.
756 2018-01-15 22:15:08 bet.. that's why u got cleavage and u smell like castor oil
757 2018-01-15 22:15:00 Yeah I’ve been using jojoba oil for like 3 years now. It’s just not working in this harsh ass NY winter 
758 2018-01-15 22:14:41 In brightest day,
And darkest night,
I'll tell you h'what, 
That boy ain't right,
Let those who worship crude oil's might, 
Beware my power of propane light!

759 2018-01-15 22:14:36 Fsa are saints and not jihadis, Syrian government works with Isis to get oil etc, all in collision with zionists
760 2018-01-15 22:14:24 The oil sits nicely on top of the pepperoni if you do it right.
761 2018-01-15 22:14:21 oil slick all the time then he gets sick
762 2018-01-15 22:14:15 He shook his head. “No, this is our time…” Batter made he dipped the Chien in it and then dropped it into the boiling oil. He did it with all of them.

764 2018-01-15 22:14:14 Olive oil + Onion + Garlic + Jalapeño + Salt + Pepper + Red wine + Tomato paste + Tomato sauce + Honey + Ground seitan = Pretty goddamned good and easy pasta sauce. 

Incidentally, also legits need to open wine—not that I need it.
765 2018-01-15 22:14:04 Ya either oil or actual peppermint. It always helps me. Ginger too, like fresh ginger tea. Just make it strong & goodluck
766 2018-01-15 22:14:02 mmmm this is irking me so much more than it rationally should 
but imo the remediation team (mine) shouldn't be joking with the oil people about how we're gonna have to clean up their messes. that's just acting like them fucking up is inherent and ok
767 2018-01-15 22:13:29 A pile of blankets called Finger School where you massage beards with coconut oil while tring to find out who the 4am DJ was
768 2018-01-15 22:13:26 United fan when they’re spending money: “it’s not my money I don’t care”

United fan when city spend money: “the oil team ruining football”

Where do they find them? 
769 2018-01-15 22:13:23 Something's gotta give on $CDN no? Oil prices rising + BOC escalating rates (another one soon)...$0.85/0.88 next? Currently at $0.8047 $USD
770 2018-01-15 22:13:10 I mean I’d rather have pizza than oil tho, if they’re the same

773 2018-01-15 22:13:00 Mine is hormonal too. Spironolactone helped, but I had to go off it. I am finding Evening primrose Oil somewhat helpful as a substitute.
774 2018-01-15 22:13:00 Aren’t we already below five-year averages? Five-year avg itself may have to come down in 1H18, but on a forward supply basis as well as an absolute basis, OECD oil inventories should be below five-year avg at exit-17.
775 2018-01-15 22:12:54 I don't consider demonizing the free press, independent courts, and law enforcement "Superficial". I don't consider denying science to help oil companies "superficial". I don't consider a Muslim Ban "superficial", your dogged and dogmatic whataboutism notwithstanding.
776 2018-01-15 22:12:46 May you drown your troubles in olive oil, fresh garlic, and the best bread.
777 2018-01-15 22:12:31 Both teams would probably be scrapping it out in the championship without oil money
778 2018-01-15 22:12:29 $CEI With oil prices surging, I see this beauty market cap over $100 million. Mean shares price over $1 $$$$$$
779 2018-01-15 22:12:16 If oil changes are good enough for cars then they're good enough for me
780 2018-01-15 22:12:01 i posted earlier today on oil, its lower down on my feed
781 2018-01-15 22:11:49 Non Stinky Stuff is brilliant. It’s an oil that you apply to the skin. It’s made from herbs and natural ingredients. No worries if the dog licks it off as it can also work from the inside out - like a medicine. Look it up on Fb or on its web site. They also make a Stinky Stuff -
782 2018-01-15 22:11:47 Thank you  for all the great things you did for our country! I’m especially happy you protected Bears Ears and marine sanctuaries in Alaska and Hawaii! We will fight against this administration plan for dirty oil destroying them.
783 2018-01-15 22:11:22 I’ve never understood the obsession with what other people eat. You do you, let me have my warm oil in peace
784 2018-01-15 22:11:21 @GenevieveNnaji1 does your feet smell like hot oil

786 2018-01-15 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: raw crust with sad coconut oil and Italian sausage.
787 2018-01-15 22:10:58 I still remember the lessons i learnt on my fire service day. Dont touch electrics if you smell gas. Dont put water on a oil fire. Dont re-enter a burning building. Plan your escape routes. Put a wet towel under the door to prevent smoke. Plus more. Pretty good for pr.
788 2018-01-15 22:10:40 Pizza is pizza, and oil is oil!
789 2018-01-15 22:10:29 I'm out here still boycotting BP like the oil spill didn't happen over 5 years ago
790 2018-01-15 22:10:28 @Valvoline ... I had thee best experience @ your oil change place @ 123rd and Pulaski in Alsip,IL
They were very helpful and informative.. Thank you
791 2018-01-15 22:10:28 I shaved w coconut oil & ive never felt so boujee in my life 
792 2018-01-15 22:10:22 #Kurdistan is in the Iraqi constitution this is a fact your hatred can't change this. They sell their oil to Iran turkey Israel Greece etc any place they want it's their oil. It's seems to be the only places that are "finished" are iraq and syria ruled by the Shia #Iranianregime
793 2018-01-15 22:10:15 It always makes me wonder when someone says/tweets "just pay him what he wants" in reference to ANY player. That makes NO sense whatsoever.  Even City w/ all of their oil money know better not to upset their pay scale, players, and team balance. Less reason to do that w/ a diva
794 2018-01-15 22:10:13 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
795 2018-01-15 22:10:13 Try castor oil or coconut oil (: they both help for growth and repair
796 2018-01-15 22:10:08 Lookin at y’all pics I realize I’m not as moisturized as I think I am.........my skin don’t ever be that shiny unless I use baby oil
797 2018-01-15 22:09:51 I... I like warm oil
798 2018-01-15 22:09:43 #Kurdistan is in the Iraqi constitution this is a fact your hatred can't change this. They sell their oil to Iran turkey Israel Greece etc any place they want it's their oil.

799 2018-01-15 22:09:31 dolar a 45 o 50 y gas oil a 31 pesos...aaah y UTE mas barato ! como se hace para que pase eso y no afecte la inflación mínimo de 50% ? son unos GENIOS !
800 2018-01-15 22:09:21 I'm sure lavender oil smells divine. I should cop a bottle.
801 2018-01-15 22:09:20 You literally would've gone into administration without Roman Oil
802 2018-01-15 22:09:20 Scam warnings usually come with zero info.
803 2018-01-15 22:09:17 Why does Big Oil and Gas need corporate welfare? If it'such a great product, why do we need to subsidize it?
804 2018-01-15 22:09:12 OIL DIFF: 5.55 -> 5.58
805 2018-01-15 22:08:55 LOL next time! I remember when I was younger I used to throw in these little gel/oil filled balls from The Body Shop! And you would throw them in and they would dissolve and then you would feel all gross afterwards! lol
806 2018-01-15 22:08:53 Geez. I drank a lot of oil last night.
807 2018-01-15 22:08:47 Roger made a person with oil.
808 2018-01-15 22:08:43 parmesan cheese will soak up the oil problem solved
809 2018-01-15 22:08:40 Note also the killer clause at the end- excludes trade which "cannot" be attributed to a region. (As if it took place in outer space) 

What they actually mean is it completely excludes oil revenues!!
810 2018-01-15 22:08:39 Who posted how to fix your teeth with coconut oil?
811 2018-01-15 22:08:35 Lol what you mean? The car tells you when you need an oil change..
812 2018-01-15 22:08:32 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
813 2018-01-15 22:08:30 I thought I could use peppermint essential oil to scent my unscented natural deodorant but instead my armpits are freezing cold from the peppermint and I am upset
814 2018-01-15 22:08:28 Oil thought?
815 2018-01-15 22:08:21 For the record Eucalytus oil is extremely toxic if ingested as it causes liver damage - so if you've bought some make sure it stays out of reach of kids
816 2018-01-15 22:08:19 Wow! Got to admire the Chinese vision. They are like the US in the 29th century. Thinking big. Meanwhile, here in US we are busy drilling more oil in Alaska and trying to make coal competitive.
817 2018-01-15 22:08:07 Lord Ima be at this oil change place all day 
818 2018-01-15 22:08:05 Oil thought?
819 2018-01-15 22:07:54 Yes.. chicken juicy.. better than using oil fr ..
820 2018-01-15 22:07:52 @kingzsport_news hahaha...small arse oil club, better settle for A.Carroll!
821 2018-01-15 22:07:47 Also the time playing dorans where I looked down at my monitor and someone in the crowd was doing an interpretive oil painting of us playing on the back of a cereal box. One of the lads still has the painting.
822 2018-01-15 22:07:46 Damn with these freezing temperatures I had to get oil back on November 13th I'm already down to a quarter of a tank for heating Imma have to call and get oil tomorrow this is ridiculous luckily my sister called and reminded me to look
823 2018-01-15 22:07:42 Put a quart of oil in the truck and changed the headlight with @StabbingContest 's help.
824 2018-01-15 22:07:42 Pour those spoons of oil on fluffy, chewy pizza crust and we’ll talk.
825 2018-01-15 22:07:31 Ahahahhaha 
When it goes their way, the lord is rewarding them. When southern states get hit with hundreds of tornadoes, massive oil leaking into the gulf, hurricanes or THE ENTIRE WORLD mocking our clown president...then its the lord punishing them over gays.
826 2018-01-15 22:07:17 i love my jeep! went in for what i thought would just be a normal oil change and long story short i got told "it's a miracle your car hasn't exploded"!!!

830 2018-01-15 22:07:00 My dad used to make grilled cheese with the mayo outside instead of butter.  Mayo is whipped oil and egg so very similar to butter.
831 2018-01-15 22:07:00 Just drank some magnesium citrate and mineral oil...I'm scared...

841 2018-01-15 22:05:55 no not really toner doesn't have to be moisturizing. I just always gravitate towards super moisturizing products cause my face is dry af i started using straight up oil as my moisturizer instead of a cream and wooow my life has changed

843 2018-01-15 22:05:40 I bet he can’t even do his own oil change.

870 2018-01-15 22:02:07 Tip for staticky ass hair!!!!! A tiny bit of coconut oil!!!! It WORKS
871 2018-01-15 22:01:52 I’ve only tried the lavender one mainly bc I have oily acne prone skin & when I used lavender oil on my skin it helped with the oiliness & blemishes so I I was like wellll I’ll see if this one has the same effect lol & it does but my curiosity has me wanting to try the green one
872 2018-01-15 22:01:48 Why do we give corporate welfare to Big Oil and Gas then?
873 2018-01-15 22:01:47 i love working on cars from changing oil on down 
874 2018-01-15 22:01:47 Natural gas couldn’t handle the load so guess what the power companies had to switch to...wait for it...coal and oil.
875 2018-01-15 22:01:43 If this is the true reason its laughable. For Man Citeh to even hint it’s a monetary thing is a total insult and I can’t believe people haven’t said more about it. Not enough oil money left in the pot is there? Citeh suddenly money conscious? Joke of a club! Mockery 
876 2018-01-15 22:01:12 Aww thanks! They also returned it to me without an oil pan gasket lol so I get to work on it myself this weekend!
877 2018-01-15 22:01:00 Strengthen your immune system with Olive Oil. Don't forget to include it in your meals!
878 2018-01-15 22:00:55 I can't even fathom the wealth he has..Even assuming he started with $1000, he should be worth 700 million with that kind of gain:)
879 2018-01-15 22:00:55 In terms of fan experience, I’d say NBA trumps all. Looking forward to the next trip, prolly in 10yrs when my wife forgets about this one.
880 2018-01-15 22:00:54 a 31 pesos el litro de gas oil ? esa gente esta muy mal informada ! 1.50 euros sale el gas oil en suecia !
881 2018-01-15 22:00:51 You're not getting money. You are just riding a bull market and acting like you're a legit genius. As @Oil_Tradr said before, during bull markets, the quacks look like geniuses. When they end, the quacks get exposed. I have a feeling you'll be extra exposed @minyarr.
882 2018-01-15 22:00:49 excellent question. many indutrial facillities have their own firefighters. oil wells in UK probably not.
883 2018-01-15 22:00:41 “Anti-renewable people consistently speak as if oil, coal and natural gas prices never go up.” #SolarQuotes
884 2018-01-15 22:00:40 Pretty sure I could change the oil myself in that amount of time and I’ve never done an oil change in my life.
885 2018-01-15 22:00:34 So the market forced them to nationalize the oil industry, not a shitty ideology. 
886 2018-01-15 22:00:33 Olbas Oil in my eye, stress.
887 2018-01-15 22:00:30 I would love to win for .... b-OIL-utiful skin. Thanks

896 2018-01-15 22:00:11 January 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

902 2018-01-15 21:59:55 Do you ever see a man and think he would smell like body odor and motor oil?
903 2018-01-15 21:59:53 As long as it comes with the three spoons of warm oil.
904 2018-01-15 21:59:51 I have fish oil and vit e oil everyday and my lovely makeup artist on upstairs Downstairs used Lucas' papaw ointment on me. I still use it

908 2018-01-15 21:59:35 also, not sure why warm oil is supposed to be a bad thing
909 2018-01-15 21:59:30 Yes, they actually knew before the 60s. My father-in-law worked for Shell. My husband was doing school reports on this. I read your tweet to my dh who laughed and said the world will fry before those lawsuits are ever settled. The oil companies will drag them out for years.
910 2018-01-15 21:59:29 Just before Brexit Vote £/$ was about 1.44 - it tanked to 1.19 at the Low and now recovered to 1.38. Recovery against € not been as strong but $ probably more impact as Oil priced in $.

912 2018-01-15 21:58:44 That film is beautiful - a moving oil painting 
913 2018-01-15 21:58:25 Oh wait, I remembered another one. "Samson & Sally" some danish animated movie about two little sperm whales. Some fucking dark concepts in that one. Like, an oil spill that kills members of their pod left and right in gruesome manner. European 80s animation is scary as fuck. :P
914 2018-01-15 21:58:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

915 2018-01-15 21:58:04 They are giving out free oil skin rigs at next home game.
916 2018-01-15 21:58:03 What is that? LMAO. Duuuuuudddee. This @minyarr character is something you'd find in ST. Wow.
917 2018-01-15 21:57:41 Bitcoin and the dollar are both down since the Fed raised interest rates in December. 

Gold, silver, and oil are all up since the Fed raised interest rates in December.
918 2018-01-15 21:57:40 George Bush killed more than a million innocent people in Iraq for oil. Address this Mark dick
919 2018-01-15 21:57:31 I’d swallow the oil just to get 2 slices of pizza
920 2018-01-15 21:57:17 that's really quite funny in a way.

Now, when Nigeria sells all its oil to China and we're paying $7 at the pump in a couple years, I'll be less amused.

922 2018-01-15 21:57:17 So does that £48B include Scottish oil and whisky? Asking since we seldom get any details, just bullshit numbers.
923 2018-01-15 21:57:03 What kind of oil?
924 2018-01-15 21:56:41 Why? Cause sometimes cats get into things they shouldnt...like rubbing underneath a car that's leaking oil...ect
925 2018-01-15 21:56:32 Feeling conflicted today because because who openly voted for Trump are posting MLK quotes on their TLs when the two don’t compliment each other at all. Total polar opposites. Water and oil. I don’t get it.
926 2018-01-15 21:56:18 Up The Fucking Reds
3pts in the bag. Closing in on the dodgy oil twats.
927 2018-01-15 21:56:15 Yes, that is a common use for Eucalyptus oil.
928 2018-01-15 21:56:11 United are united Gary. That crowd across the road who buy players from oil money will never be united. Deep down you know that.
929 2018-01-15 21:56:07 So they freed 244 Boko Haram members. 244 murderes back into the society. Are we really one United? Nothing is uniting Nigeria than Oil.
930 2018-01-15 21:56:01 "Why won't you cover my engine." Well your car had a 1/2 qt of oil in the pan... Its supposed to have 6. 6 quarts. You had 1/2 of one. Uh. Hello?
931 2018-01-15 21:55:55 That good feel when the whole house smells like white wine, olive oil, and garlic
932 2018-01-15 21:55:52 y’all think coconut oil or tea tree oil does better for the skin?
933 2018-01-15 21:55:52 But if I did that to you, with speed you'll goan look for that ado and paynt. You'll now soak it in red oil for me
934 2018-01-15 21:55:52 they specifically aren't vegan because plastic comes from crude oil and crude oil is dinosaurs
935 2018-01-15 21:55:40 I can't believe how much they try to sell more than I asked for..  haha just do the oil change! I'll take care of the rest

937 2018-01-15 21:55:25 What preparation? Why is Manohar Parrikar supplying beef as a Brahmin? Why is Brahmin Fadnavis selling temple lands and celebrating Christmas like a Christian? Why is oil pulling jaati member Modi giving more concessions to Muslims and Christians? Answer me, fool!
938 2018-01-15 21:55:21 What's the difference between extra virgin and 100% pure olive oil? Asking for a friend.
939 2018-01-15 21:55:18 i was just thinking about this please play snake oil except play it they way jenna and julien play it on their podcast it would be so funny
940 2018-01-15 21:55:15 That is interesting to know. I vape as a replacement to smoking so interested in oil perhaps. I will look at your site. I am interested to know if hemp cbd is as effective as the cannabis? People say not. Your thoughts?
941 2018-01-15 21:55:03 I've worked with a few good ones over my time (15yrs). Your right it should be encouraged, you have to work with grease & oil etc but there are gloves & overalls. There's 3 I worked with in particular that are as good/better than any bloke I've worked with.

Don't buy the hype on Mariner East 2 shutdown: Pa. is still in back pocket of Big Oil & Gas | Will Bunch …
948 2018-01-15 21:54:19 Like most things, running small business is more complex than 1st appears. My hub & I ran a cafe for a company in 1980s during oil bust. We made good $. They wanted more $. We made more $. They wanted even more. We refused to pay crap wages & serve crap food. We parted ways.
949 2018-01-15 21:54:18 U.S. oil companies expected to produce gusher profits & big gains 4 investors Analysts predict steady recovery in EPS even if oil prices don't rise over the next 2 years #Oil companies buoyed by the rising price of crude oil r set 4 major profit recoveries the next 2 yrs #invest
950 2018-01-15 21:54:16 Aye that and their investments backhanders tax evasion and oil invasion.
951 2018-01-15 21:53:51 Yes it’s a very thick oil lol it can clog pore and people that have those issues don’t need pores clogged w/ thick oil
952 2018-01-15 21:53:46 I've seen 2 hair videos that said peppermint oil promotes hair growth 
953 2018-01-15 21:53:32 Yeah I think there was a lot of hysteria which drove up the prices. Peak oil only exists of you don't believe in innovation.
954 2018-01-15 21:53:31 Midnight oil, Beds are Burning VOILÀ
955 2018-01-15 21:53:27 Good. It's their income they're spending. Not oil money.
956 2018-01-15 21:53:15 They do lmao, but they keep a hierarchy in the boujee oil ranks
957 2018-01-15 21:53:15 Dow is booming! Jobs are coming back to Alaska. Oil is knocking at the door of 80 bucks/barrel. The economy is soaring. Consumer confidence is back. Unemployment is at a 17 yr low & Alaska families just got a major tax cut. 
Libs say "The sky is falling." Can u spell Costco
958 2018-01-15 21:53:06 That's doubtful. Venezuela's socialist government handed the oil sector over to incompetent cronies. Any recovery will have to wait until foreign creditors take oil assets away from the Maduro government.

961 2018-01-15 21:52:15 There used to be more than 75k when there was no mode of transport. But you guys don't know anything before Oil money. Don't you ? #MUFC
962 2018-01-15 21:52:03 That sounds lovely. Have you seen my chicken traybake recipe has it has a very similar theme to it. Love roasted veg with garlic and olive oil. Plus have mine with chicken on top and honey too.
963 2018-01-15 21:52:03 ..I can't say I've ever had a foundation freeze. I guess it depends if it's water based or Not, cause I'm assuming if its oil or silicon based it might have fucked up some ingredients

970 2018-01-15 21:51:05 Still there are men that look like oil painting only in black-and-white photos. No of course Matt looks perfect in color. But in black-and-white shots so much depth, some semi-tones sufficient to convey the look and atmosphere.
971 2018-01-15 21:50:49 if you enjoy using oil paints i have a quick question: what circle of hell are you from?
972 2018-01-15 21:50:47 Don't know about eating healthy , but some candles and lavender oil and a hug is the best XxX
973 2018-01-15 21:50:42 Well oil beef hooked (say quick)
974 2018-01-15 21:50:42 crude oil is counted in inventories no matter how bad a quality it is. For example is their tanks with eagle ford condensate in from days when insufficient pipelines and insufficient demand for it. Remember All producers hold assets. They don’t specify if it is worthless
975 2018-01-15 21:50:27 Snake oil!!!
976 2018-01-15 21:50:21 Wood Group? So big Ian’s picking up some leftovers is he? That will be his reward for being the one who lied about the demise of the oil industry & went out of his road to destroy our vote for independence. Fit’s at sayin? Sold his soul for english gold.
977 2018-01-15 21:50:09 Fare la scarpetta! (whether it's oil or sauce)
978 2018-01-15 21:49:56 To me the Dems practice neo liberal fascism.  They allow the private sector to own production assets but think they are smart enough to control the economy.  

That way they can take credit for their spending programs and blame Wall St or Ins. Co's or big oil when things go bad.

981 2018-01-15 21:49:38 what kind of oil?
982 2018-01-15 21:49:36 I told Mike to take my car to get an oil change today since he was off. He had one job, guess what ain’t get done. He was adamant I didn’t need to make an appointment, then they tell him it’s a 3-4 hour wait. He’s gonna learn to listen to me.
983 2018-01-15 21:49:31 Will you report on the cleanup efforts of the oil spill on the west coast, or maybe if the now very shrunken Alaskan Wildlife Preserve has been tapped for oil yet?
984 2018-01-15 21:49:27 City are all about the blank cheques. United make their money through revenue we ain't got an oil king backing us. There's loads of players that move to city for the money before pep. And now you've took the high ground of refusing to pay a player that you do want. Bullshit mate
985 2018-01-15 21:49:27 @NYGovCuomo Why are you allowing Petro Home to buy up all the oil companies on Long Island to monopolize this market?  They recently charged me 4.397 per gallon - 153 gallons - $672.87!!!  That's not overcharging that's rape!
986 2018-01-15 21:49:26 Every time I go to Honda to get a simple $50 oil change... They try n say I need this this and this, etc... Bringing my cost up to $300+..

996 2018-01-15 21:48:28 So how do you make this happen? You pay ecos to campaign against oil (having first set up your wind divisions to rake in subsidies). It seems to me Exxon were the only ones who did not go along with "renewable" energy scam - so ecos and rest of oil coys shafted them.
997 2018-01-15 21:48:28 Or maybe she could just go vegan and not eat twinkies, or oil or high fat foods?

1016 2018-01-15 21:46:17 Mate we are a tiny island. U Arabs have polluted the entire world selling oil and driving bugattis ffs
1017 2018-01-15 21:46:09 But... but... that's only because the oil price has slumped! 

...wait a minute...
1018 2018-01-15 21:46:04 The Last Oil: Gathering to Resist Trump’s Reckless Arctic Energy Policy - Instead of reducing extraction of fossil fuels to stabilize the global climate as science mandates, the Trump administration has launched a war on environmental conservation & indigenous human rights …
1019 2018-01-15 21:45:59 Now because it's so expensive "because of government" ... you can raise your margin to 15%, 20% What's more you make more money from half the sales - than before - but you have the assets for twice as long. The idea oil coys against higher taxes is bonkers.
1020 2018-01-15 21:45:55 Oh yeah can't forget Lake Beersanthwaite....that will oil the wheels for the night 
1021 2018-01-15 21:45:53 Burning the midnight oil cos a lot is on my plate
1022 2018-01-15 21:45:44 Looks like we have ran out of heating oil, at least the weather is not too bad, whoops, wife and kids not impressed at cold showers
1023 2018-01-15 21:45:38 Almost out of oil. We’ll be without heat if they don’t come within the week. It’s already been 2 months since they were able to come. Who even has oil heat in New England?! FML and F 2018. #sendhelp
1024 2018-01-15 21:45:37 Yarra River 8:40am
MfB crews are trying to stem the chemical leak, which appears to be similar to oil ,near the Walmer Street footbridge in Abbotsford.

1026 2018-01-15 21:45:28 "do you like oil more than rolling?"

"when I was in high school we would roll fat joints"
1027 2018-01-15 21:45:28 "Safe pair of hands" --> @_HenryBolton 

Yeh right. I'd rather drench my hands in olive oil and see how many eggs I can carry across my kitchen.

Dude belongs in a bank, stamping documents, or possibly a circus.
1028 2018-01-15 21:45:25 mmm warm oil
1029 2018-01-15 21:45:24 This is amazing so glad to rise out of my addiction shame
1030 2018-01-15 21:45:16 I love getting out of the shower smelling like dove & coconut oil.
1031 2018-01-15 21:44:56 I got one from Tesco that does that. Now lets beat cancer. Not sure about world peace don't want to run out of oil
1032 2018-01-15 21:44:43 Hmm. Obama was golfing, fundraising, and on a holiday weekend -largest oil spill 2010 in the gulf. Were you upset?
1033 2018-01-15 21:44:39 it’s a christmas sweater bath bomb!! i also threw in a ginger bath oil to get Even More Spice
1034 2018-01-15 21:44:28 to be fair, he now owns a tuxedo or two. wears them regularly, for his opera group stuff. 
$15 tuxedo from second hand store. Oil heiresses stalked him when he was single. Ones I've read about. Scary cougars.
1035 2018-01-15 21:44:07 80% are working in Oil  companies... Some on Telecommunications industry and some runs other ITC firms, others into production company etc.. You can't be hiding in one corner and be doubting what you don't know. Do your research.
1036 2018-01-15 21:44:05 They have to “sell” the idea of more, bigger Military-Why? Because of oil.
1037 2018-01-15 21:43:40 80% are working in Oil  companies... Some on Telecommunications industry and some runs other ITC firms, others into production company etc.. You can't be hiding in one corner and be doubting what you don't know. Do your research.
1038 2018-01-15 21:43:27 Oil & Gas oil contracts, concessions, jobs may be on their way to the Chinese companies handed freely on a gold plate and not #American but then again we never imagined shocking bare knuckle #Racism remarks from @realDonaldTrump
1039 2018-01-15 21:43:26 Scotland didn't benefit from oil income. It got no High speed rail, no motorways, no channel tunnels, no Thames barriers & no Olmpic Games.
1040 2018-01-15 21:43:20 Synthetic oil baby sport
1041 2018-01-15 21:43:17 Be sure to check your oil people
1042 2018-01-15 21:43:16 Would it be better if it were cold oil? Asking for a friend. 
1043 2018-01-15 21:43:16 I worked out early then went and got the oil changed in my car. Now I need to grade papers and do dishes and figure out my dinner situation.
1044 2018-01-15 21:43:15 The only think i can get to work is the nip n fab hydronic moisturizer and coconut oil on top but coconut oil is annoying to use 
1045 2018-01-15 21:43:02 Yo I went into the beauty supply store the other day to get some oil for my locks. I seen like 4 spanish niggas in line with durags ready to purchase. Y’all really follow every wave. Niggas been wearing the shits.
1046 2018-01-15 21:42:47 Oil companies should countersue for legal fees when this gets thrown out of court.
1047 2018-01-15 21:42:47 I cooked it. Frying pan, low heat no oil. Turning a few times. Then a little heat towards the end for a little more crust. The best black pudding I’ve had. I tweet a picture but I’m not proud of what I made
1048 2018-01-15 21:42:44 loving my Hemworx CBD oil and so do my doggies! Organic and purest, no fillers.
1049 2018-01-15 21:42:41 なんかよく分からんけど良かった
1050 2018-01-15 21:42:26 im gonna say yeah just cos he footage is used to give the artists a template to work on, every frame in that film is still an actual oil painting
1051 2018-01-15 21:42:19 Cos it wouldn’t be newsworthy to say Pep, (& the greatest team ever) media darlings have been turned down as the player wants to go to Utd, as did Berba & RVP better to promote the economical sense of the oil money #whatever 
1052 2018-01-15 21:42:04 Lol yea me too! I use tea tree oil now
1053 2018-01-15 21:42:00 You guys made me buy snake oil and now it's my family's all time favorite game. I can't wait to watch this one!
1054 2018-01-15 21:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1055 2018-01-15 21:41:43 Massage castor oil into your scalp
1056 2018-01-15 21:41:29 Yes/SNP insisted oil was "a bonus"; we argued that it appeared to form the basis of their fiscal plans; turns out we were right then, and right now. You're the one who was defeated then, and defeated now.

1058 2018-01-15 21:40:51 So you want to cripple our economy again when we can't use oil for transport.  This line will release capacity on a number of other routes to the benefit of those who live nearby with better passenger services and more freight capacity to take lorries off our roads.
1059 2018-01-15 21:40:39 When I was 4 I had to leave the room because the oil sludge monster in Ferngully scared me so much
1060 2018-01-15 21:40:25 Same for oil. Producers/traders/refiners may have Crude they now know is impossible to sell or too difficult to run. They may have to wait until market conditions change, I.e. shortage of naphtha to be able to process. Ilike any business things maybe bought and conditions change
1061 2018-01-15 21:40:25 Coconut oil, if you’re not prone to pimples or black heads lol
1062 2018-01-15 21:40:22 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！

1065 2018-01-15 21:40:09 And the essential oil infuser is the cherry on top.
1066 2018-01-15 21:39:58 @jiffylube can I get a coupon for the 52$ oil change please
1067 2018-01-15 21:39:55 I’m sure Hansel’s heard of mineral oil, he’s a rigger.
1068 2018-01-15 21:39:30 BT, Belgacom, Shell, BP, De Beers, JAB etc etc etc - Euro companies pull every natural resource from oil to coffee to diamonds out of those countries and set/control utility prices.  Economic strife *always* leads to political and social unrest /2
1069 2018-01-15 21:39:28 OIL DIFF: 5.56 -> 5.6
1070 2018-01-15 21:39:26 Sear it on both sides first in oil. Maybe a minute on each side. And then take it out of oil, melt some butter in the same pan with thyme and garlic, and baste the steak.
1071 2018-01-15 21:39:22 Ah, so he didn't mean what he said. What about "oil is a bonus not a basis" then? When the truth was that oil was very much a basis for White Paper's fiscal plan.
1072 2018-01-15 21:38:59 If utd score another paddy power buying me a tank of heating oil !! Come on utd ! #MUFC @packie55
1073 2018-01-15 21:38:50 Sex doll won't transmit STDs,
Sex won't use oil to tie you down,
Sex doll won't fuck men that'll use her destiny for blood money thereby transferring you some bad luck,
Sex doll won't take your name to the village. 

Should I continue?
1074 2018-01-15 21:38:38 Oil must be drying up over there
1075 2018-01-15 21:38:12 Finally did it man.. living in Texas and working for a oil rig thank you lord for blessing me!
1076 2018-01-15 21:38:10 These rentier states based on oil have no future. It was the depletion of both oil and water in Syria that helped to foment the revolt. Bashar might have won the war through apocalyptic violence but nature will be the final victor.
1077 2018-01-15 21:37:55 Sitting waiting for an oil change. The lady across the waiting room turns to her boyfriend and says "I'm cold, give me your coat".
She has no coat, she is wearing a tank top. He looks like he is going to the Artic.  BTW,  the high today is 33. He's pretending not to hear. #genius
1078 2018-01-15 21:37:54 I’m an oil change mechanic. It drips off the cars. Usually it drips down the back of my neck but this time it dropped into my mouth. Taste disgusting. 
1079 2018-01-15 21:37:51 Extra Virgin Coconut Oil gets ye to sleep and not hungry
1080 2018-01-15 21:37:50 It's happening guys just got off the phone and I should be in a plane to the oil fields within the 4-8weeks!
1081 2018-01-15 21:37:45 You have any idea about  investment of Middele East people in Europe and U.S company

I give you one example,
Appel 800 billion dollar company, and its 5% is Saudi Arab prince.
 Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook and so many company, they invested. Now they are not dependent on Oil
1082 2018-01-15 21:37:42 you've to learn that two separate things which are good on their own don't mix well. youre the oil to my water.
1083 2018-01-15 21:37:17 @PeeweeAAOilers
1084 2018-01-15 21:37:04 Nothing is open because of QFII CNH limits and tightening capital controls. China can't do anything but drive their domestic oil price at a discount/premium to USD/bbl.
1085 2018-01-15 21:37:00 Have yo tried roast8ng it with garlic, chilli, choppe onions and a glug of oil?
1086 2018-01-15 21:37:00 Eat fat and loose wait...Yes, healthy fats like Avocados, walnuts, olive oil, coconut oil, cold water fish..
1087 2018-01-15 21:36:58 So it's my 2nd time using Argan oil contained products, 1st my face cleansing and 2nd was my hair mask. The results were tremendously shocking of how fast it treated my damage from both skin and hair. I strongly suggest everyone to start using product which contains it.
1088 2018-01-15 21:36:54 Oh, man. You said the oil workers would build the wall. Read your own tweet. Lightweight.

1091 2018-01-15 21:36:32 Yes, continue in your pandering. I’m sure it pays well selling off humanity to the corrupt oil mafia.
1092 2018-01-15 21:36:22 @SBSNews China races to tackle expanding oil spill after tanker sinks. Iranian tanker sunk in flames as black smoke suffocated air above East China Sea. There is fear oil spill will cause devastating marine damage. China ships in race to clean up and reduce harm to environment.
1093 2018-01-15 21:36:21 So oil actually going up due to demand and future demand or just a reaction to weaker dollar?
1094 2018-01-15 21:36:18 but city r still the oil money fc...

1096 2018-01-15 21:36:04 lukaku without the goal had a great game. 

The goal is good for his confidence. But I'd take this performance from minister of hair oil and lotion.  

I didn't mention name oh
1097 2018-01-15 21:35:51 thank you
1098 2018-01-15 21:35:42 SNP are not,scots just want self gov,WM has over 40 years bankrupt an oil rich country!,,that and disrespect for scots votes is what`s killed the union.
Don't beg us to stay then treat us like shit
1099 2018-01-15 21:35:36 What kind of oil is the real question here.
1100 2018-01-15 21:35:21 She asked what do I use as moisturizer and when I said coconut oil she was like oh that’s why you have breakouts...the dermatologist didn’t even mention it 
1101 2018-01-15 21:35:21 Thanks. I've actually been taking Evening Primrose Oil and I think it helps. They recommend it for PCOS. Mine is very hormonally linked.
1102 2018-01-15 21:35:13 I got the black castor oil line from shea moisture. I tried a little of the leave in and liked it so imma give the line a try
1103 2018-01-15 21:34:55 and it is actually the government who causes the inflation and they and the BofE persuade everybody that inflation is caused by oil prices, wages, a falling exchange rate etc. It is one of the biggest deceptions in economics.
1104 2018-01-15 21:34:49 The economy being up has little to do with Trump and / or is his policies, it is like an oil tanker and the momentum built since 2008 is why the US economy is performing well.  The stock market is different as the tax cuts have an immediate effect on shareholder value.
1105 2018-01-15 21:34:34 aye when you see the message between him and oil mcburnie

1116 2018-01-15 21:33:50 That’s nearly Nat bingo. Just waiting for trident and secret oil fields
1117 2018-01-15 21:33:26 They're really good with bacon. Veg though, slice in half and roast at 400 with coconut oil salt & pepperfor like 45 minutes. Also good with olive oil, and drizzle with balsamic when they come out.

1121 2018-01-15 21:32:52 Trump is not looking forward to clean power, because he is backed by big oil, and he has stocks in Putin’s oil field over in Russia. Trump is out for Trump and family not you not me. Sanctions on Russia keep Putin from drilling the whole 600 acres.

1126 2018-01-15 21:32:17 i accidentally spilled vanilla oil on myself so if you have the urge to lick me that's why
1127 2018-01-15 21:32:14 So, basically, Russia and Turkey are preventing any future oil contracts between the U.S. and Kurds.

1134 2018-01-15 21:31:41 And you haven't even met Andrej Babiš - former communist secret police, now billionaire, made his money on fertilizers made from oil, trying to survive as billionaire even after EU had cut biofuel subsidies. Zuckerberg at least invented some blogging tool, or what.
1135 2018-01-15 21:31:39 Quality just like the oil.
1136 2018-01-15 21:31:36 They Abu Dhabi, They blocked us! So we stop the oil lol

1142 2018-01-15 21:30:32 Prosperity for the poor does not limit your potential.  Another’s strength does not weaken you.  And violence does not produce peace.
The only zero-sum game is bleeding our planet to death.  Oil, coal, fracking are unsustainable and damaging.

1146 2018-01-15 21:30:10 Doesn't explain SNP using an optimistic prediction for oil taxation revenue as a basis of their fiscal plan while saying it was just a 'bonus'.
1147 2018-01-15 21:30:06 hair is currently drenched in coconut oil. this week is going to be good.
1148 2018-01-15 21:29:57 France, meanwhile, generates most of its power with nuclear plants and has a much lower carbon footprint than Germany.

(They built those plants because of the 70s oil embargo.)
1149 2018-01-15 21:29:48 It's really good, great coverage but doesn't feel thick or heavy and keeps my oil slick of a face from looking wet through!  Don't think they did have a true porcelain though and it oxidizes a little too but everything else is on point!
1150 2018-01-15 21:29:45 Just made the best pasta salade. Housemate is arguing with his gf about the same shit as always. Have an interview tomorrow. Cheeky rdv on Wednesday. Need to study tonight. Bought a new puffa coat online. Miss my brother and just moisturised my hand with olive oil.

1157 2018-01-15 21:28:32 How many companies produce products they never sell? It is the reason we have sales at the end of the year trying to shift inventory nobody wanted. It is the same for oil companies. If quality is so poor it needs to so discounted it is worthless to the seller
1158 2018-01-15 21:28:03 haven't used oil paints in 3 weeks. getting 2 hours in tonight...
1159 2018-01-15 21:28:02 I’m slightly annoyed & confused as to why I made an appointment at 1:30 for an oil change.. and I’m still here at 3:30.. TWO HOURS.
1160 2018-01-15 21:27:53 Oil? Hmmm if still becomes scarce, factories close to lack of workers, at this peace oil would be good in 5 years. Trucking logistics maybe cured in 3 years, due to shortages.  Reserves drain at a rate not seen thanks to exporting
1161 2018-01-15 21:27:38 @ThatKevinSmith & @JayMewes thanks for being apart of $BE @beleavecanada #Medicinal use & #CBD is important for people living with #MS like I am. #Canada needs to #EndMS in the mean time @JustinTrudeau has to make good on #July1 #2018 #cannabis #cbd #oil #Toronto #PotStocks #TSE
1162 2018-01-15 21:27:38 I'm sure there is an essential oil to help her get moving 
1163 2018-01-15 21:27:29 Now why did I just get an email talking about testing out cannabis oil smh sounds like the Ops. I'll pass
1164 2018-01-15 21:27:23 #ORHL 50+ Champions: the Oilers over the Flames by a touchdown, while the Hawks came up short 3-1 vs. the Grey Wolves. Oil still on top!
1165 2018-01-15 21:27:10 mmmm, oil
1166 2018-01-15 21:27:04 I'm  just going to soak in a essential oils bath, massage my skin with vitamin E oil and watch movies for the rest of the night
1167 2018-01-15 21:26:49 That is some gorgeous #bathart! What did you think of our new Dreamtime Bath Oil?
1168 2018-01-15 21:26:45 Getting an oil change in this weather sucks. I just wanna get back to my warm apartment. 
1169 2018-01-15 21:26:42 They hate the rain so I imagine they're all hiding out right now - v.little oil on their feathers plus fimbriate margins mean they get waterlogged easily
1170 2018-01-15 21:26:32 False.  1940’s America was self sufficient in oil. 
1171 2018-01-15 21:26:07 They're meant to be breakfast muffins so they're not too sweet. There's sesame oil in there, which gives it a savoury taste, but the apples are little bursts of sweetness. Look up the chef, he has a 2-Michelin star pub and is generally lovely.

1173 2018-01-15 21:25:40 In my lifetime I've had to reboot a number of "facts" as modern science tests & reexamines. I've learned  Van Gogh didn't shoot himself, Edgar Alan Poe didn't OD, he died of rabies, JD Salinger had PTSD, all oil paint(ings) made after Hiroshima A-bomb contain new isotopes. 1/2
1174 2018-01-15 21:25:31 Occasionally used whatever conditioning oil with a mustache comb so it was not as rough.  Isn’t wax mostly used for long handlebar?
1175 2018-01-15 21:25:31 if he trades as well as he writes, he's probably long right now 
1176 2018-01-15 21:25:30 At the very least, I’m a decent salesman. Would you be interested in this lovely snake oil we have available for purchase? It really goes well with any outfit!
1177 2018-01-15 21:25:29 i finally conquered my fear of trying new things and used my jules and esther oil and moisturizer today. putting oil on ones face seems like the last thing you'd want to do, but i guess not? so far so good. *hands*
1178 2018-01-15 21:25:22 I’ll try that. I got literally every oil @ home. Thank you.
1179 2018-01-15 21:25:21 Does 10-W-30 count as an essential oil? Like, without it your engine would seize. (I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.)
1180 2018-01-15 21:25:18 Haha .. Haha.. What about China??  dont worry we will manage ... Anyhow middle east would be gone in  10 years.. They are surviving till now coz of oil.. Any how Jai Hind.. Vande mataram
1181 2018-01-15 21:25:15 Hate coming to the dealership for an oil change waiting is excruciating

1186 2018-01-15 21:24:48 It is more likely a scenario on the east coast, since oil tankers regularly offload there. But, no one mentions this. The hypocrisy is astounding.

1189 2018-01-15 21:24:15 Really? Does he need to worry about his looks. I appreciate I'm not oil painting but I wouldn't mind looking like Nisar but as for his mate #TheUndateables
1190 2018-01-15 21:24:13 I would've gotten a hotel last fucking week if I had known... should've figured though.

I need to get an oil change this week at some point.
1191 2018-01-15 21:24:10 @SSCAC We are fuel assistance clients and have had to supplement our heating by oil with electric heaters and our bill is out of control, and overdue.  Any help, or suggestions?

1193 2018-01-15 21:23:45 Why have city ran out of money? Oil spill?!
1194 2018-01-15 21:23:43 Hindi pa ko nakakapag change oil at gear oil. Hahah bigyan nyo naman po ako ng time mga bessy 
1195 2018-01-15 21:23:39 Pricing oil in CNY doesn't influence USD prices when China's capital account is practically closed. The oil futures contract is delayed until later this year.
1196 2018-01-15 21:23:38 i fucken broke our garbage disposal like an idiot lmao, i put noodles down it... and it leaked oil and got clogged :^ ))))
1197 2018-01-15 21:23:36 Meant to say tea tree oil. You can get it at dischem
1198 2018-01-15 21:23:26 How do you keep your hands so clean?? My hubby cones home covered it oil/grease etc etc 
1199 2018-01-15 21:23:21 What kind of oil
1200 2018-01-15 21:23:05 They are the present version of the old Snake Oil salesmen of another era. But there seems to be a predisposition to not learn from the experience of other countries, who have suffered from communist regimes.
1201 2018-01-15 21:23:05 *drinks fish flavorized oil* *Happy beeps* Mmmmmmm delicious!!!
1202 2018-01-15 21:22:54 Get a spray bottle of water & put 10 drops of tea tree oil in it. Spray on your face every night before bed. Don’t rub it in, just let it soak into the skin

1205 2018-01-15 21:22:46 I used 22g for a year to inject and then realized I could just order 25 or 27s and it was so much more comfortable. The 27s do make it pretty difficult to push the oil out so I think 25 is a good medium
1206 2018-01-15 21:22:44 Tea tree oil worked for me, but burned my skin so I now dilute with avocado oil.
1207 2018-01-15 21:22:43 Oh my goodness, I had NO idea and would never have thought of this! Got a diffuser for Christmas & have been using it with lemon oil. Just noticed Geoff sneezing a lot this weekend. No more lemon oil!! Thank you!
1208 2018-01-15 21:22:36 Me too actually, just addicted to them so.much after pd101 and burn many midnight oil to knothem more
1209 2018-01-15 21:22:34 I swear weekly hot oil treatments and heated deep conditioning is the holy grail for natural hair 
1210 2018-01-15 21:22:27 An essential oil to make you shut the fuck up about your essential oils.
1211 2018-01-15 21:22:26 As this snow comes down more and more everyone rushes to the store pointless items and demanding oil changes
1212 2018-01-15 21:22:26 I LOVE Maggiano’s. Didn’t think I was crazy at all for asking what kind of oil they used in the fryer (can’t have corn or soy)
1213 2018-01-15 21:22:23 The best things about horses is that they’re Grass Engines. Grass goes in, fast goes out. Most things that produce fast like cheetahs or cars need more high quality grass or oil. But horses just need grass. Producing efficient fast with less grass.
1214 2018-01-15 21:22:21 Unfortunately, spilled oil goes wherever the currents take it with little regard for which country banned drilling.

1216 2018-01-15 21:21:53 How about a fetish for listening to goopy oil spills under cars, sorry this one sucks
1217 2018-01-15 21:21:39 So salty are city, truth is their oil money can only be funneled in limited amounts without being too obvious. Can't run too large a wage to revenue ratio and violate FFP
1218 2018-01-15 21:21:37 Tree tree oil in hot water also works
1219 2018-01-15 21:21:33 You should have an issue with $25 million per year for CEOs while laying off thousands of workers amidst oil at $28 all the while getting a raise. That’s the definition of a piece of shit.
1220 2018-01-15 21:21:31 1) "And by the way, while we're on this subject, on of the things we should do is cease protecting all those Texas oil millionaires who are one of the greatest menaces any civilization has ever seen." #jamesbaldwin
1221 2018-01-15 21:21:27 Which oil companies have repeatedly interfered with. A la the electric cars from twenty years ago and other projects.
1222 2018-01-15 21:21:24 1. If you are very far removed from those who buy rice& beans, garri in cups, kerosene & palm oil in tiny cans; when you are far away from those grovelling in government teaching and general hospitals for lack of drugs and proper diagnostic tools, you lack the right to lead.
1223 2018-01-15 21:21:23 Regardless of what anyone tells you you're not going to believe them anyway so what's the point in trying to have a discussion. I have worked 30 years in the oil and gas industry and have been too many a 3rd world Shit hole countries where the government steals from the people
1224 2018-01-15 21:21:10 he just did the mental equivalent of doing a 360 tailwhip with a oil tanker

1226 2018-01-15 21:21:01 Them: Never overfill your engine oil. It can cause your engine to lock up. 

Me: Gotcha!

Me: *accidentally overfills oil* Well it’s in God’s hands now.
1227 2018-01-15 21:20:48 Yay for two hour oil changes
1228 2018-01-15 21:20:41 @realDonaldTrump border wall stops daca talks,trump is bent on destruction  of America, oil,coal,nuclear war,rise up America, pray mueller locks him up
1229 2018-01-15 21:20:39 city have had over £1 billion put in by oil rich billionaires since they were formed in 2008. Uniteds fucking leech owners have taken over £1 billion out for themselves since they took over. They can fuck off taking the moral high ground on Sanchez. Fraudulent cunts
1230 2018-01-15 21:20:24 Bout time we entered the race for Sanchez . Sounds like Big Roms gunna get that oil money ready again.

1235 2018-01-15 21:19:33 Couldn't possibly comment- I've never drunk a can of oil so I'll have to take your word for it.
1236 2018-01-15 21:19:24 Welcome to 2018 when you can look at porn on your phone while waiting for an oil change with old people all around you.
1237 2018-01-15 21:19:19 Someone is really arguing with me on here about the gulf oil spill like I'm pleased it happened tf?
All I was saying is I'm going to eat crawfish anyway it's really not that serious

1239 2018-01-15 21:19:07 It’s called oil.
1240 2018-01-15 21:19:04 How can Alexis Sanchez be too "expensive" for a team that has a bottomless pit of oil money?
1241 2018-01-15 21:18:51 No issues so far 2nd year owning it just the basic power steering engine oil tires nothing big  so I know how to maintain one
1242 2018-01-15 21:18:44 Smelling like Moroccan oil and cocoa butter
1243 2018-01-15 21:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1244 2018-01-15 21:18:36 @realDonaldTrump anyone who live in coastal states,you are gonna have oil rigs off your coast,and all we need is new clean wind turbines,solar,earth is dying,fossil fuels are killing it,trump is killing earth
1245 2018-01-15 21:18:33 Going to Lexus for a routine maintenance & oil change definitely has a plus ever since I picked the super attractive female service advisor. 
1246 2018-01-15 21:18:26 It will, anoint yourself with Olive oil daily for 21 days
1247 2018-01-15 21:18:08 Three spoonfuls of warm olive oil infused with garlic, tomato and basil would be pretty tasty. Not to mention the cheese lol
1248 2018-01-15 21:18:07 "I thought you were the one for me, but sometimes you have to learn that two separate things which are good on their own, do not mix well. You were the oil to my water"
1249 2018-01-15 21:17:59 I used tea tree oil and hydrocortisone 10 and found that my cystic acne slowly stopped popping up and I basically have no painful bumps or pimples anymore..the scars and dark spots however, I still haven’t figured out how to get rid of. Anyway.. I hope that helps!
1250 2018-01-15 21:17:58 I have an electric oil filled radiator going spare if you want.
1251 2018-01-15 21:17:47 I oil my boobs every night after my shower.
1252 2018-01-15 21:17:30 Glad I was of help to feed your kids:)
1253 2018-01-15 21:17:24 Then with the tea tree oil it doesnt do much especially with oily skin I try to stay away from oils cause it clogs my pores
1254 2018-01-15 21:16:58 I might do that! I've heard the ordinary's rosehip oil is really good though so I may try.........

1258 2018-01-15 21:16:25 venezuela is doing pretty awful right now but that's mostly because it's entire economy was based on oil, which is failing miserably right now. blaming the problems in venezuela on socialism does nothing but harm, and it misses the actual point of the issue

1262 2018-01-15 21:15:41 Maybe their businesses aren’t growing.  IBM has been leaking oil for years now.  You can’t look at the economy this way picking out examples that fill your slanted view.  On either side.
1263 2018-01-15 21:15:33 There's an oil slowdown in Russia. 
1264 2018-01-15 21:15:30 This contradicts the article by @ThierryMeyssan that states Iran is owed monies from oil still flowing through the pipeline.
1265 2018-01-15 21:15:26 Putting tea tree oil in your shampoo and then washing my hair gives me an out of body experience
1266 2018-01-15 21:15:19 Man I really need to learn how to change my own oil.
1267 2018-01-15 21:15:04 New tires, oil change and car wash all within 24 hours. Spoiling my car.
1268 2018-01-15 21:15:04 How is the crash in oil prices Notley's fault? I get the carbon tax thing buuuuut 66% of Albertans get it all back and about 26% get MORE than they paid.

1275 2018-01-15 21:14:26 Try CBD oil..?
1276 2018-01-15 21:14:22 I hate to ask that person what he thinks of using OLIVE OIL for cooking purposes. Yeah, time to be afraid.....be VERY afraid.
1277 2018-01-15 21:14:22 The best thing for #crypto will be when reputable financial institutions come in with their own regulated coins.  Finally get rid of all the snake oil salesmen.   #crypto.  $btc $bch $eth.  

I can see it now...sorry sir, we don’t take bittrash, only Chase or Citi coin
1278 2018-01-15 21:14:20 I haven't yet found an oil that doesn't clog my pores but the hydration AT THE TIME feels great ;_;
1279 2018-01-15 21:14:16 Probably oil city Y. Only because it is closer. I haven’t really considered anywhere else.
1280 2018-01-15 21:14:13 Actually, I’m kind of considering swallowing 3 spoonfuls of warm oil now.
1281 2018-01-15 21:14:05 Man I wish I had mouthwash with Oil of Wintergreen still...
1282 2018-01-15 21:14:00 What's wrong with this Nigerian team for God sake
1283 2018-01-15 21:13:57 =Sanchez actually wanted a team with history instead of oil
1284 2018-01-15 21:13:52 They didn't. And they just re-elected a conservative government and refused to join the EU. They also rely on their huge sovereign wealth oil fund to support a population of 5 million.

Silly and ignorantly parochial to compare Norway to the US.
1285 2018-01-15 21:13:51 'MLK Drive' 2nd most popular street name in USA after '1st street,' put that in your morning corn flakes and eat it.

1297 2018-01-15 21:12:24 Lol I got teammates 2nd of all ur a walking donation and 3rd of all $50 ain’t shit I spend that on gas and oil for the day
1298 2018-01-15 21:12:17 why is it that we castigate corporations that fix prices (or attempt to) but think it is a good thing when the oil producing countries collude to fix prices and availability of oil?????
1299 2018-01-15 21:12:12 Screw investing crypto currencies have you heard of oil diffusers
1300 2018-01-15 21:12:00 Did I ask u? Better lemme alone,everyday ull b looking fr my trouble 
1301 2018-01-15 21:11:54 Crispy fried tofu. So delicious. Tofu marinated in tamari, ginger & sesame seed oil, coated in nutritional yeast and than pan fried. Yum!
1302 2018-01-15 21:11:33 I guess there is only so much oil money...
1303 2018-01-15 21:11:31 Hey hope ya feel better, put clove oil on ya tooth with cotton ball stinks and bad flavour but it works
1304 2018-01-15 21:11:31 Carmex because I like putting what’s basically motor oil on my lips
1305 2018-01-15 21:11:27 The difference is scots have a genuine greivance,before union we fought ourselves,after we were fighting the world.then oil showed the union for what it is,a freindly takeover,scots can now see it,even unionists but many choose to ignore it.
WM greed+disrespect killed union

B1, 6, 12

Fish oil 2400mg

Take this combo in the morning as the B Vits will make you pee! A lot!

Drink at least 4 6oz glasses of Water over a day

Lay off your coffee habit! If you feel sleepy or run down drink water
1308 2018-01-15 21:11:13 Literally no excuse for that. Oil changes should be an hour, maybe two max. If they were too busy they should've said something. Is this a small business or a chain? If chain, call corporate. You shouldn't have to pay for their incompetence.
1309 2018-01-15 21:11:02 copper, palladium and other metals have performed the same. Oil is also up. Where is the catch?
1310 2018-01-15 21:10:55 SURPRISE it's motor oil
1311 2018-01-15 21:10:55 米$に対して円高ってなんでだろー。ユーロは円安って何か理由があるはず。OIL価格が上がっているけどDAWを押し上げるかな？
1312 2018-01-15 21:10:51 How do I prove please?
1313 2018-01-15 21:10:34 Idk about ya’ll but Tea tree oil doesn’t work for me neither does that sheabutter black soap stuff. It does the complete opposite

1320 2018-01-15 21:10:14 @CharlesYetzer Where have you been since 2014? Oil is finally climbing in value again. The evidence is gas prices.
1321 2018-01-15 21:10:07 Did you take any medication? Cause Lee uses some oil when mine is paining.
1322 2018-01-15 21:10:01 I would fish by these bad boys. You know the fishes will hang around these blenders for quick snacks.
1323 2018-01-15 21:09:59 Waiting for my uncles car to get the oil changed & they are playing hella throwbacks & I’m about to start singing out loud 
1324 2018-01-15 21:09:59 Soya and oyster sauce. Splash of olive oil over the top 
1325 2018-01-15 21:09:51 lets Pray Reg u removed from safety of workers n mines or now on oil platforms  won't blow up like what happened not many yrs ago here & killed 10 Injuring 17 1 n China just killed all. Reg were put n place 4 safety of people remember explosion n plant that nearly wiped town away
1326 2018-01-15 21:09:38 Or do we call out snake oil because it's snake oil, without regard to who's pitching it? That's my preferred approach, but I think it's a serious question with more than one possible answer.
1327 2018-01-15 21:09:32 A lot of articles about it being a scam, practice was created by a snake oil salesman.
1328 2018-01-15 21:09:18 I absolutely despise getting my oil changed
1329 2018-01-15 21:08:56 City paid far too many bungs to get youth players to join their oil soaked human rights abuser club our "free" press boys love so much!
1330 2018-01-15 21:08:55 I believe I found out how the oil spill took place. It's 4 days of history.
1331 2018-01-15 21:08:50 I looked it up! It just needs its first service. (Oil change, filter check etc etc) Im taking it in on thursday
1332 2018-01-15 21:08:49 I love my oil diffuser! #VicTsing #NewRelease #OilDiffuser
1333 2018-01-15 21:08:33 deliciously nutritious pizza oil
1334 2018-01-15 21:08:20 If we excuse this woman because we diagnose her from afar with a mental illness, then do we ignore people like Ainscough who sell similar snake oil but actually do have cancer?
1335 2018-01-15 21:08:18 Oil at work.

Simple.
1336 2018-01-15 21:08:12 These ideas don’t scale very well. I don’t think you can have an increasingly diverse country with 350 million ppl offer the same public entitlement system as a tiny country with lots of oil.

1339 2018-01-15 21:07:43 Remember that time all oil stoped flowing out of the Persian gulf because the Iranians we sinking supertankers and oil went up to $300 a barrel and the entire world economy cratered? Oh wait, that didnt happen--can't imagine why
1340 2018-01-15 21:07:37 Trudeau's willingness to castrate oil and LNG production in CA will have an even bigger impact on destroying the economy in the next several years. Sad.
1341 2018-01-15 21:07:34 To the extent that the Trump administration any “agenda“ at all it seems to be “Trump must prevail”. The Bannon faction seems to have been ousted And the Wall Street/oil/militarist factions in power
1342 2018-01-15 21:07:26 Don't fully understand the article. Aren't PG One's fans using wry humour to mock the magazine as "gutter oil"? Not sure anyone actually thinks it's a restaurant. Not fake news...

1347 2018-01-15 21:06:40 Norway' population is 5 million. It's oil and gas production is so lucrative, it has no budget deficit, in fact it has savings of $1.3 trillion. Norwegians like most Scandinavians are homogeneous, trust each other. Minimal corruption, even the government, paying taxes willingly.
1348 2018-01-15 21:06:30 And for a little longer, Saudi oil.  Ohh, how great US independence is
1349 2018-01-15 21:06:17 id drink the oil if it tasted like pizza
1350 2018-01-15 21:06:12 Hi Emma I was just wondering if you could tell me what is the best oil to cook your Haddock fishcakes in? Many thanks Emma @shecanteatwhat
1351 2018-01-15 21:06:02 Yeah SUFFERING with LESS TAX BURDEN, LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT, Abundant oil reserves, BETTER Foreign deals--- 
And NO LONGER fear paycheck to paycheck living. Have you SEEN THE STOCK MARKET?
1352 2018-01-15 21:06:00 Deliberating if this means more that 4 fed hikes. Not good for EM oil importers.
1353 2018-01-15 21:05:59 But plastic is so embedded in our lives (as  the oil it comes from!) Much of it does a great job! Look at plastic in cars. saves wt = fuel!
1354 2018-01-15 21:05:53 Lmao peanut butter is just peanuts and oil.
1355 2018-01-15 21:05:51 *giggles* D-Does oil taste good?
1356 2018-01-15 21:05:43 6. Make calendar reminders for non-weekly things like car oil changes, paying property taxes, changing the furnace filter, refilling the bus passes.
1357 2018-01-15 21:05:42 Only because there were no mineral rights or oil. Then he'd use an executive order to steal it and start fracking it.
1358 2018-01-15 21:05:42 @realDonaldTrump embargo in the Venezuelan oil sector !
1359 2018-01-15 21:05:03 Possession of rose oil is boujee indicator #6584.29
1360 2018-01-15 21:04:51 Good call on the chile sesame oil! Gotta add some !
1361 2018-01-15 21:04:50 Awesome trick I learned about them: cooking them right!
Line them in a tall pan and gently cook them until the bottom is crisp (add some sesame oil for the taste), then add water up to half their height and let simmer for two minutes.
1362 2018-01-15 21:04:38 Trump: embargo on Venezuela's oil sector !!
1363 2018-01-15 21:04:33 Brent crude rose by US39 cents or 0.6% to US$70.26 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US51 cents or 0.8% to US$64.81 a barrel.

1366 2018-01-15 21:04:01 Has the price of crude oil gone down recently
1367 2018-01-15 21:03:57 I would try too, if I wasn't unable to eat anything except oil
1368 2018-01-15 21:03:49 Qué solución les  pueden dar es la pregunta el costo de la producción es altísimo al precio del gas oil
1369 2018-01-15 21:03:45 The oil has dried up has it 
1370 2018-01-15 21:03:36 steaks are really good in a sous vide. after the sous vide is done, fry them a little on both sides in oil in a hot pan for just a few minutes each side

also easy no fuss hard boiled eggs, make a big batch at once, delicious plain with salt, pepper
1371 2018-01-15 21:03:34 Literally: to sell oil
1372 2018-01-15 21:03:28 When you have almost unlimited national income from (now nearly depleted) oil reserves, you can afford to give everything away.

1376 2018-01-15 21:03:17 In CO, the bill would have raised the severity of criminal charges for tampering w/ oil & gas production equipment from a misdemeanor to a felony, but the bill lost.  I agree that it's scary that our gov't wants to silence our voices, even scarier when our citizens do.
1377 2018-01-15 21:03:02 I am sitting down to a lunch of two slices of pizza, when you made this appear in my TL.

Mmm, warm oil!
1378 2018-01-15 21:03:01 The ONE time we need these financial doping, oil guzzling wankers to spend some money, it’s too much for them. £55m for a right back ok though?? Disgusting
1379 2018-01-15 21:02:40 see that shite that USA does to justify oil invasions , then think USA is just the tribute act that came in late to the game.
1380 2018-01-15 21:02:36 I thought you were the one for me but sometimes you have to learn that two seperate things which are good on their own do not mix well

You were the oil to my water
1381 2018-01-15 21:02:30 I do, too, especially when they try to hide it by calling it "vegetable oil" or "glycerin"
1382 2018-01-15 21:02:24 LOL because they are involved too! I mean anyone that thinks Daddy Bush wasn't involved in 9/11 really needs to open eyes! He wanted to get into Iraq to LOOT their money caches for destroying his oil wells in Kuwait!
1383 2018-01-15 21:02:16 Has the oil dried up or has FFP prevented them from paying silly money

1387 2018-01-15 21:02:02 Only time I use dish soap beside doing the dishes is to get oil of my hands, since it seems to have a much stronger effect than normal soap.
1388 2018-01-15 21:02:02 Okay, I had spicy Mexican food for lunch, got a pedicure, oil change, now doing some stairs and walking..
Come on, baby boy!

1392 2018-01-15 21:01:46 She doesn’t have standard acne she has some weird shit they ain’t normal. I get acne even at my age because my skin has oil in it. She doesn’t have that. Hers is some weird shit that they wanna say is beautiful because white people have it. 
1393 2018-01-15 21:01:36 Good thing your kid isn't a First Nations member or Trudeau may have just sprayed them down with tar sands oil out of sheer habit

1395 2018-01-15 21:01:25 Thought I’d show my hair some tlc after being in the pool all weekend and apply a nice argan oil hair mask. I applied loads of what I thought was my hair mask to my hair and just as I finished I looked at the pot again and realised it was in fact my body butter. Brilliant 
1396 2018-01-15 21:01:23 mommy got my oil changed today thanks to her.

1430 2018-01-15 20:57:35 I remember Obama sanctioning Russia, signing the Magnitsky act and expelling dozens of diplomats as well as other sanctions applied during his 8 years...including the halting of oil drilling in the arctic ... Exxon hated that lol --

1439 2018-01-15 20:56:35 Who's the most highest ranking Iraqi official on Twitter that's in charge of the nation's oil?

I got a bone to pick with him.

Thanks, #OOTT
1440 2018-01-15 20:56:24 yeah..... ? also this is offensive to people who like warm oil
1441 2018-01-15 20:56:18 My dog is sleeping rn and he looks real cute. I'd take a pic but my camera doesnt work bc I dropped my phone in fucking hot oil.
1442 2018-01-15 20:55:35 These companies are making record profits and reside in the U.S. we still give tax credits to oil companies who make record profits each year. Companies are making money, people at the top of those companies are making money.  The middle class has shrunk and fallen into a working
1443 2018-01-15 20:55:22 I been smoking oil all day ,my brains are fried cuh
1444 2018-01-15 20:55:08 Please tell me is this a threat to stop trading with scotland if it is independent? Im sure many countries would want our oil and gas electricity and water,not to mention food and drink
Threat or promise Mr Mundell?
1445 2018-01-15 20:54:57 I forgot my knee brace and forgot to oil my hair before I left for work  I'm slacking today smh
1446 2018-01-15 20:54:42 Current aesthetic: motor oil, chaptstick, and a messy bun.
1447 2018-01-15 20:54:40 The one on Hwy 61? That place sucks after 1 1/2 oil change wait found out it was done in 30 they just forgot to tell me
1448 2018-01-15 20:54:23 I’ve lived in Norway and Sweden, speak both languages fluently and this is one of the biggest myths leftist spew.

@johanknorberg has written extensively about this, but briefly;

 has a very strong private sector, but very high taxes and VAT.

 affluency is down to oil.
1449 2018-01-15 20:54:18 I’m getting an oil change and food then I’m on it!
1450 2018-01-15 20:54:16 No an oil lamp surely?
1451 2018-01-15 20:54:10 My drunk ass showered last night and used half a bottle of in shower oil on my hair like It was shampoo. I now have oily hair for days
1452 2018-01-15 20:54:10 Oil money is running dry
1453 2018-01-15 20:53:50 BIG OIL is coming for your dietary habits

1455 2018-01-15 20:53:05 For my body I use epizone cream mixed with vitamin e oil
1456 2018-01-15 20:52:58 @AnnapooraniOil Please follow back. We are interested in exporting grains for edible oil processing such as (Sesame Seed, Soybeans, ground Nuts and Coconut).
1457 2018-01-15 20:52:58 But I thought you said two years ago that the North Sea oil was running out ?
1458 2018-01-15 20:52:47 We have found a supplier in Amsterdam of @Pics_PB and honestly I could happycry. I brought a jar home with me from NZ and it's already half gone. Everyone here adds palm oil (boooooo) and sugar (ewwwww) to their PB and it's gross and wrong.
1459 2018-01-15 20:52:41 We had a positive meeting today between the KRG/MNR and the DG of SOMO (the DG of Economic Department at the Iraq Ministry of Oil), discussed potential mechanisms for exporting Oil to receive a fair share of the Iraqi budget for the Region.   Great step for further dialogue
1460 2018-01-15 20:52:41 No, don't think it's about money. City may want Sanchez, but they don't really need him. That's why. Unless the world stop using oil, City never going to run out of money.
1461 2018-01-15 20:52:38 So if Oil FC have ended there interest in Sanchez, does that mean he is ours?
1462 2018-01-15 20:52:36 Depends on the oil.
1463 2018-01-15 20:52:35 Oh cmon you are really comparing this guys who is FIGHTING against a government CORRUPTED that has people in Starvation and hold themselves thanks to the oil and gas money and NARCO deals with cartels? With extremists Taliban that fight bc of religion?
1464 2018-01-15 20:52:31 got my boys oil changed.... FINALLY! I feel like racing him at 100 mph down the 10 freeway  lol

1467 2018-01-15 20:52:07 Bitch where is the olive oil
1468 2018-01-15 20:52:04 22% of Americans think...
Canada is a Japanese sword. 
Mexico is a misspelling of large oil company.
1469 2018-01-15 20:52:04 Willing to bet that a higher percentage of sailboats sink than oil tankers however

1473 2018-01-15 20:51:31 Never heard such rubbish in my life. City have been throwing cash around since the oil money came. Wise up.
1474 2018-01-15 20:51:28 used motor oil is good for your lawn or grass in general
1475 2018-01-15 20:51:20 Empower Therapeutic Soaking Salts and Topical Relief Oil are popular ways of tending to aches and pains! Ask a bud tender about them today!
1476 2018-01-15 20:51:11 Who's care ? United can provide a lot of money to do that. Not oil money 
1477 2018-01-15 20:50:38 Venezuelan here. People don't see the money from oil now. We won't be getting any of this either. It's just another way to launder money and get their stuff to Miami.

1479 2018-01-15 20:50:22 Essential oil is my makeup lol
1480 2018-01-15 20:50:16 I’m doing the kind of cleaning today that involves vanilla extract in the fridge, eucalyptus oil in hot water, and double the Barry time. 

(Barry is my Roomba.)

I’ve been a shell since coming back from Australia. Time to FIX SHIT. 


1481 2018-01-15 20:50:08 The apparent lack of appreciation of the players resale value or lack thereof, having just seen 100m flushed down the toilet on Alexis is staggering. Last time I checked, we didn't have an oil well in the car park or a bundle of decent commercial deals to rely on..
1482 2018-01-15 20:50:05 Used tyre and wipers , that’s minor  . Oil leak it’s probably a seal . Depends how much of brake pipe needs repacking , shouldn’t cost you a packet . Still have some left to do your hair n nails 
1483 2018-01-15 20:49:54 Nice! Btw, nasubukan ko na rin sa wakas ang lomi. Shookt ako. Hahaha. Dami palang stretching nun. At ang gastos sa oil. LOL.
1484 2018-01-15 20:49:48 This is all SO TRUE too! I already have Bad Mobility Days. And that's just my body, before we talk about peak oil, a dying planet, etc

1486 2018-01-15 20:49:37 Hope its not u
1487 2018-01-15 20:49:17 Every time I go get a oil change they tell me something else need fixed and it’s going be about $200 
1488 2018-01-15 20:49:06 A Singapore court on Monday filed additional charges against 9 men accused in a large-scale oil theft at Shell's biggest refinery, the latest development in an extensive investigation in the city-state #Oil #Singapore #shell #Justice

1491 2018-01-15 20:48:45 I’m making progress with my art, and I’ve discovered I love cartoon style drawing. I’ve been stressing about wanting to make photorealistic oil painting for years. This is fun
1492 2018-01-15 20:48:36 I took my car in for an oil change at 2 o’clock YESTERDAY and they still aren’t done. A fucking oil change.
1493 2018-01-15 20:48:35 We at SC Wildlife Federation appreciate your separating the wheat from the chaff when it comes to statements from Jeff Duncan on offshore oil and gas.  He is and has been extremely misguided on this issue.
1494 2018-01-15 20:48:33 I know nothing of these charts or things, but I do have a curiosity....by chance what is the price of oil been over this time? Ie. Russia & SA, need higher priced oil to survive. Has Conald done this to aid them?
1495 2018-01-15 20:48:17 He's a snake oil salesman John. Creepy book and he's peddling his wares. Alex Jones wannabe trying to damage our country from the inside.
1496 2018-01-15 20:48:12 Avi so greasy, you might want to run it through an oil filter.
1497 2018-01-15 20:47:18 لا ماعليه اهم شي تغيرين جو
1498 2018-01-15 20:47:16 i gotta get my oil changed, new wipers, brake pads, rotors, aka having a car is trash
1499 2018-01-15 20:47:10 Have you tried our Mask of Magnaminty yet? This mask is packed with honey to calm and moisturize skin, while ground aduki beans exfoliate. It is also packed with peppermint oil to invigorate skin and create a natural glow!
1500 2018-01-15 20:47:02 Meal, but eggs and bagels? Easy. *he assured them as he pulled a pan out from the cabinet and set it upon the stove, his right hand nabbed the bottle of oil and poured a dab of canola on the pan as the other set the heat to 9*
1501 2018-01-15 20:47:01 Autonomy does not succeed with emboldening Iran all the more by allowing it to export gas and oil to Europe. Iran is the archenemy of any autonomy for the Kurds. I am for autonomy as well, but your method contradicts with it.
1502 2018-01-15 20:46:58 De Gea...
1503 2018-01-15 20:46:56 OILさんみたいに理路整然とした言動が出来ないの！
1504 2018-01-15 20:46:46 Nothing is perfectly safe. But oil makes life safer in general. Ever tried to travel to Europe on a sailboat? I don't recommend it.
1505 2018-01-15 20:46:46 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging. In order to report this to our bakery, could you please send us a DM with the UPC code, expiration date, and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!
1506 2018-01-15 20:46:41 Sadly, WWII was about acquisition of oil resources in the Middle East as well.
1507 2018-01-15 20:46:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1508 2018-01-15 20:46:14 Demoran suba de naftas para evitar resentir el consumo en el verano
Oil aumenta mañana 6% y el resto mira a la competencia. No se detiene el aumento del crudo, que impacta directamente en los surtidores y colabora con más inflación
1509 2018-01-15 20:45:42 break pipes , oil leak , frount tyre think that's it lol oh windscreen wipers to.
1510 2018-01-15 20:45:27 #ManchesterUnited ‘We’re not a money team’ 
‘Arab money’
‘Oil money’

Little do they know, Manchester United actually spent 300 million in 2 years but with no improvement.. Happy with ties vs mediocre teams and wins vs surely-to-be relegated teams..

City on the other hand 
1511 2018-01-15 20:45:16 Castor...castor oil...

No stameta just use castor oil.

1512 2018-01-15 20:45:08 Will they get a case of linseed oil so he can put up numbers like the last pirates player they got.

1513 2018-01-15 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1514 2018-01-15 20:44:46 Getting an oil change at pep boys was a mistake......no WiFi, no free coffee, and a man in a cowboy hat is loudly calling Obama a “communist” inside the store.....this is the future conservatives want
1515 2018-01-15 20:44:01 My favorite way to think of vegan meals is to picture a plate with veggies, a grain, and maybe a lentil or bean. It’s as simple as stir frying your favorite veggies in oil and some seasonings (buy a BUNCH at the store so you don’t get bored), cook up rice or pasta, add beans!
1516 2018-01-15 20:44:00 This new body oil i got smells heavenly 
1517 2018-01-15 20:43:53 I was thinking do all the above I guess if time is permitted. Oil with glitter blacklight on show, then after a shower show to wash it all off. Best of all worlds.

1530 2018-01-15 20:42:27 What oil slow down?
1531 2018-01-15 20:42:15 Yes that bit is correct. They had to find some way to bring spirit back to the people so they could create an army to go to war and steal shit as it is happening today. Wars use a lot of oil, good job Rothschilds and Rockerfeller were there to sell it and Vatican profit weapons

1554 2018-01-15 20:38:29 But this is not true. Preference is given on basis of conditions in many cases. If it doesn't matter then don't consider it period.
1555 2018-01-15 20:38:23 tea tree oil smells so gross but works so good
1556 2018-01-15 20:38:17 I swear by coconut oil; it keeps your skin moisturized and supple. If you’re looking for a skincare regimen, I like the Ole Henriksen Little Wonders kits.

It’s stretched and braiding it up two nights in a row helped. If you don’t here from me about the cream I used by end of day remind me please
1564 2018-01-15 20:37:21 Thanks @One_Angry_Chef Just finished the coconut oil section in your book and “most health bloggers fail to notice it makes everything taste like sun cream, is yet another reason their views on food should be ignored” is quote of the year already for me!

1566 2018-01-15 20:37:08 Is it garlic oil?
1567 2018-01-15 20:36:37 The US was there, paying the freight for ISIS. Israel was buying their stolen oil. And Turkey was helping both. Somebody should tell Donald before he does something stupider.

1575 2018-01-15 20:34:37 We must not allow anybody or any force feel that we don't count. That means we're gonna have to work hard. We're going to have to burn the midnight oil sometimes. We must set out to do our life's work so well that nobody could do it better.

1598 2018-01-15 20:30:59 Like raised the fuel efficiency standards that would decrease oil consumption. You know there is not an endless supply. It doesn't reproduce.
1599 2018-01-15 20:30:50 Battery power has improved immensely over the years, as has solar tech. the only reason these things took so long is big oil and greed. Now, finally, it's taking off big time in terms of research. Grasping at the past won't save the planet.

1612 2018-01-15 20:29:30 the Saudi’s are pumping oil regardless of the price because the entire well being of KSA relies on it. The US doesn’t set the price of oil. The market does. The Saudi’s and OPEC actually wanted to keep the price low to kill off shale energy drillers in the US.
1613 2018-01-15 20:29:29 Stop the movement to south. Northern youths should go back to farming to feed themselves, to feed their cattle and earn a living. These politicians don’t have their interest at heart, all they care about is oil money. #Aforestrationiskey.

1626 2018-01-15 20:27:33 I've been told all my life that olive oil (virgin or otherwise) was healthier, but eating things with it made me feel just as miserable as the deep fried corndogs I used to eat at the gas station. I don't get that from coconut oil, so coconut oil is what I use.
1627 2018-01-15 20:27:32 Lol good luck. 1 year spread made new highs today. R/R on longs isn't favorable either.

Oil prices are back up. O&G companies are busy. Our economy is finally on the uptick
Imo the min wage will just take a little adjustment but places will get used to it. Overall I think it will go a long way towards curbing poverty
1635 2018-01-15 20:26:47 it's amazing what you can do with marinated meat and hot oil.

Sure Oil will be good but want those flow rates.
1637 2018-01-15 20:26:01 Really cause in your previous tweet you said "oil and gas are last century". Seems to me that's a general (and quite untrue) statement against oil.
FYI fossil fuel use continues to increase, and carbon tax has proven not to reduce emissions (see BC)

1641 2018-01-15 20:25:24 Don't comb your hair when its dry, and don't dry it often cos that causes breakage. 

Spritz your hair with water so that its damp, then use a detangler (Aunt Jackie's is the best).

Regular hot oil treatments also helps to soften hair

1650 2018-01-15 20:24:30 IndyRef was certainly democratic—many of the cautionary arguments used by unionists have been proved to be true. Yes and SNP were hardly democratic given their use of misrepresentations—such as "Oil is a bonus not a basis!".
1651 2018-01-15 20:24:26 As a compromise, I suggest that we allow offshore oil drilling only within 10 miles of Mar-A-Lago. We should also allow unlimited, unregulated fracking on the grounds of Mar-A-Lago. Nuclear waste could also be stored on the premises of Mar-A-Lago. This seems fair.

1657 2018-01-15 20:24:00 Don't believe the lie that Sco is subsidised. Think about it. What other oil producing nation is skint? For over 30 years solid we sent oil boom money south. The figures that were used to more honestly reflect Sco finances were stopped, as politically they were seen as a 1/2
1658 2018-01-15 20:23:58 Right, and they also left out oil! :)
1659 2018-01-15 20:23:47 Test seaweed and make a blanket to soak up oil spills in oceans. My idea.

1664 2018-01-15 20:23:37 Ahead of the BoC, I must point out that absent ‘non-recurring’ items: the lagged impact of weaker CAD, the rebound in oil and the enhanced child tax benefit, Canadian economy would’ve expanded sub-2% in 2017 ... where we revert to in 2018.  If the Bank goes, it’s one and done!
1665 2018-01-15 20:23:36 There are already other party games that are far more deserving of the success that CAH has seen. Say Anything, the Game of Things, and Snake Oil are far more entertaining.
1666 2018-01-15 20:23:27 She's just a partisan toady.   She removed the indignation about dear leader's p***y grabbing tape from her campaign website.   She was the only CA rep to sign onto the letter to Cmdr Chaos supporting offshore oil drilling.

1706 2018-01-15 20:17:02 ScotGovt never used oil as "reason" for independence. Furthermore Scots GDP per capita without oil is similar to the UK's, but with oil takes it 10% higher.  But consider Norway, its economy is 30% dependent on oil & it's one of the wealthiest nations on earth, not bankrupt.

1720 2018-01-15 20:15:23 “Big unnecessary regulations” save this planet from demolition. Why don’t you want oil drilled off of the coast of Florida?
1721 2018-01-15 20:15:10 Whole heartedly agree, but road lobby is to powerful..... gonna be a while before all the oil runs out.

1742 2018-01-15 20:13:03 Good talking points I guess you are OK with his racism, using the office of President to feather his own nest, destroying long standing friendships with allies, backing out of the Paris Accord, oil drilling anywhere, RUSSIA. For the majority of us he is the worst President ever.
1743 2018-01-15 20:12:57 So I tried a new face mask, took a bubble bath, exfoliated with the new coffe scrub I made, and moisturized with coconut oil (used aloe Vera and vitamin E for my face) I feel sexy

1762 2018-01-15 20:11:35 the oil companies should demand payment of their legal expenses by this idiot...
and the judge should fine him for wasting the courts time.

1771 2018-01-15 20:10:56 Take it out the fridge and massage a layer of oil on both sides (and add some salt and pepper). Do this 30 minutes before cooking and leave it out at room temperature. Cook it on a simmer and you’ll have a great steak!

1792 2018-01-15 20:08:20 Being realistic is not luck David. The banks will be setting the rules on what price we use to budget oil. They need to see how far we can go before they adjust the tap. US Shale will increase output at these prices, so lets hope it does stay @ $56
1793 2018-01-15 20:08:19 @ScottPruittOK Isn't it time to get rid of ethanol? It is no longer to augment oil reserves. Put the corn back on the market as food not gas. A world starving & farmers making millions by not feeding families put gas tanks. Shame!

1798 2018-01-15 20:07:49 CBD oil can be very helpful in opioid abuse, and alcohol abuse. Check out the research.
1799 2018-01-15 20:07:41 Vegetable oil or neat dish soap? Or lube? I have to leave now, you've set my cackle off. 
1800 2018-01-15 20:07:08 Wouldn't prove anything. You and rest of Trump haters would just move on to something else.
1801 2018-01-15 20:07:03 As the rest of the world rushes to Alternative energy sources, Trump rushes to drill for Oil and Dig for Coal. How does this make sense?
1802 2018-01-15 20:06:57 I wldn't bet on it. Politicians very vulnerable to flattery and snake oil salesmen but reluctant to legislate it seems to stop worst abuses of corporate power at public expense.
1803 2018-01-15 20:06:55 I was raised in Ak, the state in rich in history with the Eskimo’s, Native Americans, wildlife, fishing, oil production, & gold rush pioneers. They should include this in all their education. My local education was a seeing a native with an oly at a ball park. Shameful!
1804 2018-01-15 20:06:54 Real friends oil your scalp for you 
1805 2018-01-15 20:06:45 Of course the oil change and tire rotation is taking longer than normal because I haven't eaten yet.

1810 2018-01-15 20:05:59 He was fond of the hot oil

But not so fond of the teeth
1811 2018-01-15 20:05:46 Good point! Maybe he should sue all the citizens of the city who use products made from oil in their cars, etc. After all, they "must" be contributing to climate change also! We'll see how successful he is with that one. LOL
1812 2018-01-15 20:05:43 Finally getting an oil change  
First one since I got my car lmao
1813 2018-01-15 20:05:42 Yay!!! 

*makes Allison hot chocolate, gets massage oil and the butt plugs out* lol
1814 2018-01-15 20:05:35 @SecretarySonny It is time to get rid of ethanol subsidizes. Ethanol was introduced to augment oil quantity and the War Reserve. Its time to put corn on the family table & not in the gas tank.  We no longer need ethanol. What are costs of farm subsidize?
1815 2018-01-15 20:05:23 East brookfield was an oil furnace malfunction filled entire house with smoke. Unclear if it was an working fire or not
1816 2018-01-15 20:05:22 Worcester HQ.  I’m redoing my oil.
1817 2018-01-15 20:05:15 Thought the exact same upon reading the poll. Most of the 88% who voted to call it as is probably hate Drew Rememda, who is definitely pulling for the Oil during a broadcast, but calls it as is more than most, and he gets a lot of hate for it
1818 2018-01-15 20:04:49 Norway has systematically had one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe and one of the main reasons why it's even at 4.7% (which is high for them anyway) is because of the oil market.

Are you *sure* you want to stick with this answer?
1819 2018-01-15 20:04:49 By selling more and more shale oil
1820 2018-01-15 20:04:38 Oh for your face just use like 2-3 drops of rose oil c:
1821 2018-01-15 20:04:27 Now you are sounding like Trump! Yes, really with all the air pollution we already have in India, all we need is more use of oil and gas
1822 2018-01-15 20:04:26 If you put the essential oil: Lemon Grass in your oil mix it will cause your locs to smell like fruity pebbles lol
1823 2018-01-15 20:04:05 After we U.S. citizens waited and watched for days and days as BP tried to fix a bursted pipe which poured millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, we're still allowing offshore drlling? Every day I think of it I'm appalled.
1824 2018-01-15 20:04:04 Florida is a swing state & an important one that Trump can't afford to lose. Mar a Lago aside he needs votes in Florida & with the Puerto Rico situation a few oil rigs off those richer neighborhoods would make that a blue state
1825 2018-01-15 20:04:04 I if I were the oil companies I'd counter sue old Bolshevik Bill. He'll never stop using their product, flying a plane etc. Lefty hypocrite.
1826 2018-01-15 20:04:03 It’s beyond me why @KatyTurNBC is interviewing “Trump’s not a rapist” Scaramucci. He’s a trump apologist & smooth talking salesman selling snake oil. He shouldn’t be offered up as someone relevant (he’s not) with political expertise.

1829 2018-01-15 20:03:52 @SecretaryZinke Daniel Jorjani's close relationship with oil and gas must have clouded his judgment with his awful MBTA DOI opinion. Please protect our public resources and wildlife
1830 2018-01-15 20:03:41 I'm not an authority, but lemongrass essential oil worked for me. 1 drop applied to each pimple would heal in an hour if it was closed, if open it would take a day. If you'd like to try it, it may work for you. Blessings.
1831 2018-01-15 20:03:30 Wow, that’s great. Having retired after 30 years in the oil business I also need to get one of these.
1832 2018-01-15 20:02:56 He suing the oil company's because he can't die GOD.
1833 2018-01-15 20:02:28 Every time I've tried to get an oil change this week the weather turned shitty. :P
1834 2018-01-15 20:02:20 Tell me what is 1% of a $400 paycheck? 
Obama claim of $1,500 yr for family was a lie.
1835 2018-01-15 20:02:14 Getting your oil changed and inspection done is the most annoying time of the year 
1836 2018-01-15 20:02:01 Of course he does. He's a conservative. He also advocated boycotting Tim Hortons (which would hurt employees) because they took an oil ad down from their menu board.
1837 2018-01-15 20:01:57 Yes - I’ll have 12 spoons of oil thanks.
1838 2018-01-15 20:01:54 More fish anyone   took cod liver oil tablet then had a tin of mackerel.....think either one or the other, would have been sufficient!
1839 2018-01-15 20:01:53 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent of 1/4 C of flour, 1/4 tsp of yeast, a pinch of salt, one stewed tomato, basil, oregano, 1/4 c of mozzarella. There’s probably some oil in there too.

1860 2018-01-15 19:59:25 Good luck with that. LOL
Could be 'intimadation' for an 'out of court' settlement. Democrats are really bad. This kind of stuff could increase the cost of all oil products, not just gas. Democrats don't care about you.
1861 2018-01-15 19:59:21 Aye fair enough but will it stop oil employers behaving like slave traders to a workforce that need  jobs all cards in their hands and hard working blokes living on the odd nod#lousycheatingemployers!!

1869 2018-01-15 19:58:37 Time for Big Oil to move their offices.
1870 2018-01-15 19:58:35 i live for that shit. also recommend using a toner with tea tree oil (tee tree water toner) before putting your makeup on or anything else for the day. helps prevent breakouts from other skin products!

1880 2018-01-15 19:57:02 Turns out if you don't know what to do with a leafy green vegetable, have it with pasta and loads of oil and garlic and cheese and salt and pepper.
1881 2018-01-15 19:56:56 Try coconut oil. A few of my gfs said it helped lighten their stretch marks.
1882 2018-01-15 19:56:54 Boring and corny tweet. We don't need you buttereaters in my MED twitter. I will waterboard you with olive oil

1884 2018-01-15 19:56:35 I have found that most of us have unclean water, which fuels acne. Definitely get a water filtration system and wash your face LESS actually, and use jojoba oil - helped me tremendously!!
1885 2018-01-15 19:56:29 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1886 2018-01-15 19:56:15 Dude straight coconut oil!
1887 2018-01-15 19:56:10 Weirdest cosmetic article I ever read raved about how neem oil was not only a wonder for thw skin, but a feminist icon because it's an abortificant.

1891 2018-01-15 19:55:45 Well when Trump puts oil rigs all along our coasts, hopefully that will help commercial and recreational fishing alike. <sarcasm intended>

1893 2018-01-15 19:54:58 Loving Vincent is such a beautiful movie. In the ENTIRE movie each scene was oil painted by 100 people, and its gonna get NO recognition. It makes me so sad.
1894 2018-01-15 19:54:53 That is the widely held assumption  - not dissimilar to the assumption that the oil price will always rise.
1895 2018-01-15 19:54:43 It’s helped flimsy bottles of hair oil make it to New Zealand and back
1896 2018-01-15 19:54:43 It's pathetic. We get expiration soon. Let's hope that begins a sell off. Any arrows lately? FE?
1897 2018-01-15 19:54:36 I’m not sure, but I’d be out for revenge on gas and oil companies.

I denounce the clerical regime’s nine days of foot-dragging and delay in taking action to rescue the mariners on #Sanchi oil tanker. I condole the families, friends and colleagues of the sailors who lost their lives in this tragic accident.

1905 2018-01-15 19:52:33 Not for money. Not for oil!
1906 2018-01-15 19:52:33 That feeling when you're kinda mad you didn't consume a good meal? Like using too much oil and stuff annoys me, my digestion is fragile

1913 2018-01-15 19:51:39 nothing quite like picking up your car from an oil change and being handed $2000 worth of repair estimate sheets!

1921 2018-01-15 19:50:59 Nope, they produce low concentrations of raw propofol in milk which has to be refined, concentrated and resuspended in soybean oil.

This is why cows are so sleepy.
1922 2018-01-15 19:50:57 IMAGINE Venezuela at the bottom, having reportedly the largest deposit of OIL in the world. On the flip side Switzerland which has the Best DEMOCRATIC Model has been long known to be a haven for Stolen $ in their banks. Human Resource is Most Important But so is INTEGRITY right?
1923 2018-01-15 19:50:43 No chance?

1924 2018-01-15 19:50:03 It's the batter they use and they fry it in peanut oil, but it's not as healthy as people think it is.
1925 2018-01-15 19:49:46 They are rich in oil. This is just ludicrous that a country will starve it's own people.

1934 2018-01-15 19:48:59 When I started reading about this a year ago. I tried connecting dots. This is where I’m at as far as information. Our news turns around and call them terrorists and lies. They are murdering small children. Then they send our military over there to help kill them for oil.
1935 2018-01-15 19:48:57 I loved the fishing boat/oil platform scenes. (I thought I found a mistake when the pot almost fell on Clark. The guy shouldn’t have been able to knock him out of the way. But Clark saw him coming and allowed it)

1939 2018-01-15 19:47:05 I normally don't use lotion tbh, but this is a question that needs to be answered!

Maybe it has to deal with oil content? So slopping oil on your face is only gonna lead to increased acne.

2008 2018-01-15 19:39:06 For any naturalist who uses oils for their skin, what carrier oils do you like using with your essential oils?

I have moderately oily skin so what's up w avocado, greepseed, and rose hip seed oil? 
2009 2018-01-15 19:38:55 Currently: 
Ochtend: vitamin E oil en hydrating dagcreme van de tuinen
Avond: reinigen met elektrische borstel, vitamin E oil 

Ik wissel veel af van dagcreme, vitamin C lotion van the ordinary is goed voor uneven skintone.
2010 2018-01-15 19:38:52 Coz of oil.
2011 2018-01-15 19:38:46 #Whole30 day 15 - explaining to employees at the company lunch that some restaurant’s grilled chicken uses oil and isn’t just plain meat.
2012 2018-01-15 19:38:45 Id do an oil change in 10 mins 3 hours is crazy what a rip off
2013 2018-01-15 19:38:36 Oil and water do not mix. Figure out what this means. There is much more to simple words here.  Want a discussion. Reply what you think I said.
2014 2018-01-15 19:38:22 A govt that came on the heels of revolutionarizing the Agricultural sector..... Continously ignores d harm caused to the food basket of the nation qnd solely depends on SAME OIL REVENUE.....telling others to go farming.... U go fear leadership from behind...... Red card.
2015 2018-01-15 19:38:13 the Venn diagram for “insidious male feminists” and “people who buy beard oil” is a perfect circle
2016 2018-01-15 19:37:57 Lol so my oil pressure was at 120psi the all the way to work today...pretty sure the oil pressure sensor shit the bed
2017 2018-01-15 19:37:47 I have the foam and looooove it. I use the foam only in mornings and then the cleansing oil plus foam at night. When you use the oil for the first few times, you can spend at least two to three minutes just gently massaging your face to help dislodge any oil plugs.
2018 2018-01-15 19:37:37 @JennaJulien LOVE the Snake Oil game. Remember last year’s Snake Oil.
2019 2018-01-15 19:37:17 Fulani has taken the oil blocs, #Fulani has taken the government of #Nigeria as their property and now they want to take people's land.
2020 2018-01-15 19:37:11 Made a facial mask last night with coconut oil  & honey  ! 
2021 2018-01-15 19:37:07 Guess he’s worried about all the people and animals he’s destroying  confront  him.  I would like to see him swim in ocean & have oil slick envelope him.
2022 2018-01-15 19:37:04 Oil has been on a heck of a run WTI crude up again today
Every market has been lively to start 2018 but the rally in oil might be the story of the year so far ad it's especially notable as central banks increasingly begin to worry about inflation.
2023 2018-01-15 19:36:45 Cannabidadols in cannabis oil are meant to help a lot
2024 2018-01-15 19:36:38 I want a 4 cheese Mac&Cheese tossed in truffle oil , smothered with bacon & hot dog bites topped with bread crumbs and hot Cheetos!  #2018cravings
2025 2018-01-15 19:36:25 Getting the oil changed in the company truck going to be a while. Ask me anything
2026 2018-01-15 19:36:19 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
2027 2018-01-15 19:36:18 L's beard is so large he only has about 3mm sq of actual face and he hates to share so has his own glow tonic and face oil
2028 2018-01-15 19:36:14 Agreed. He is one slippery character. I keep waiting for him to pull a vile of snake oil out of his exquisitely tailored suit.
2029 2018-01-15 19:36:00 @jhmotorheadab check this out. The USA, under Trump, is ramping up oil production in their country. They are also contracting Alberta companies to supply them products. The USA is literally putting Albertans back 2 work. Why cant our own country/province understand how this works
2030 2018-01-15 19:35:56 Bring it on. The conspiracy theorist will have a field day with 500.  Gas & oil plays. Energy independence for Georgia  what’s not to like, apart from too many shares in issue by a couple of billion! 
2031 2018-01-15 19:35:55 Castor oil doing the most on my hair
2032 2018-01-15 19:35:50 trust me to be cooking and oil splashing in my fucking eYE
2033 2018-01-15 19:35:39 Triviality is dangerous. Lack of confidence in what is real and not may lead to miscalculation costing lives whether event real or not.
2034 2018-01-15 19:35:35 No you assumed it did. It’s a term used quite a bit and it just means a country selling oil or entity selling it.
2035 2018-01-15 19:34:56 Strong showing
Houston homes sold at a record pace in 2017, and the economy could get a boost if oil prices continue to recover. The Houston market accounted for 1 in 5 of the nation's 50 best-selling master-planned communities in 2017.
2036 2018-01-15 19:34:54 lol it was olive oil  on accident
2037 2018-01-15 19:34:46 Like this 3rd. Also, Raptors Coach look like he just told a broke person who came in for an oil change that they need a new transmission.
2038 2018-01-15 19:34:40 This ideological snake oil peddler is an embarrassment to the evolved human species.

#TrudeauMustGo
2039 2018-01-15 19:34:35 FUCK! I'm getting an oil delivery right now, and I get to panic in real time....
2040 2018-01-15 19:34:34 I would say this #WTI tweet aged pretty well . . . I think we are due for a pull back here, but I expect oil to break even higher in 2018.
2041 2018-01-15 19:34:28 New oil and a full tank of gas.
It's a good day to be a ricer

2043 2018-01-15 19:34:17 then I learned that secret mtgs wth formr NC Gov wrote new rights for FossilFuel cartel in NC, as in othr states, whch cancel citizns Proprty Rights in courts; OIL CO's can do whatvr they want wth your land, my land; Mineral Rights are ceded to FossilFuelers for "natl security"
2044 2018-01-15 19:34:15 Wasn't the Radisson post burnt as an offering to The Great Resource God in 2016 in hopes of appeasing Its wrath against the pitiable oil industry?
2045 2018-01-15 19:33:54 Drink distilled water. Eat more plants. Preferably raw. Stop eating meat and anything processed. Cancer has many natural, organic cures. Including CBD oil. Chemotherapy does NOT work 97% of the time. Cancer is a multibillion dollar industry.
How much money do they need?

2046 2018-01-15 19:33:43 Could just be your particular chemistry. A reaction between your skin oil and the steel. It can change with age and or diet... the body's ph levels etc. You might even get a metal taste in your mouth too if exposure is long enough.
2047 2018-01-15 19:33:40 Oil is good! It's how you cook things!
2048 2018-01-15 19:33:26 Stocked up on some Jamaican Black Castor Oil Eco, and some Actual Jamaican Black Castor Oil for scalp massages

2059 2018-01-15 19:31:58 I could use this for sure! I love Oil of Olay! #pinchme #beautiful
2060 2018-01-15 19:31:58 This is the most stupid view of the realities. We are 80% dependant to oil as the most reliable and clean sources of energy on the earth after hydro power and uranium.

2063 2018-01-15 19:31:40 I mean, the fact is that our staple crops are highly processed into flour, oil, etc. no reason you can't do that for vat grown food. You wouldn't necessarily be able to tell the different. Whole fruits and vegetables make up a minority of our diet and generally easy to grow.
2064 2018-01-15 19:31:39 The UK government weren’t using oil as a reason for voting to remain in the UK though were they? $113 still almost double what it is today and almost 3 times what the price of a barrel of oil fell to in the immediate aftermath of 2014. We’d be bankrupt if we’d listened to the WP.
2065 2018-01-15 19:31:33 You are rediculous! Your big"unessacary"cuts are to smog up our air-almost certain oil spills in pristine wilderness-opening the door to sky high prices for everything from womens health to internet! Wonderful for money mongers like you but some of us struggle-dont meed ur "help"

Pls try
2067 2018-01-15 19:31:05 Oilmen? Take a look at one of the few indigenous leaders; in Bolivia. They're bulldozing roads through several world national parks in the Amazon to frac for oil. Morales kicked out the Sierra club and neutered the NGO's
2068 2018-01-15 19:31:01 And while some use blood and sweat since their midnight oil's run out, some enjoy the fruits of labour, for near zero work in comparison. Welcome to the real world :)
2069 2018-01-15 19:30:54 Honestly that doesn't sound like a lot of oil
2070 2018-01-15 19:30:46 Start with carbon tax.  Less money for the necessities.  Job loss due to businesses closing or downsizing.  Oil companies leaving our province.  Small business letting employees go due to min wage hike.

2082 2018-01-15 19:28:58 #Sanchi Bunker fuel is the dirtiest kind of oil, extremely toxic when spilled, though less explosive.Condensate is poisonous to marine organisms.
“As with all major #oilspills, time is of the essence, the substance is so toxic and volatile”said Steiner, the U.S. marine scientist.

2141 2018-01-15 19:19:57 I think the automobile industry would beg to differ with you. Obama also has tried to redirect our energy consumption to renewable energy, but the cancer producing coal and oil industries have fought hard against that as well. those in power dont want to lose that power.
2142 2018-01-15 19:19:35 Good point. on the other side, you do not have to wait 6 weeks to get shipment from ME as we did before 2010.  If we consider production, it will be 12 weeks. 

Think about this way: some of the oil is supplied on demand.  storage becomes less relevant. we have seen it #natgas
2143 2018-01-15 19:19:35 They love the #fakerhetoric theatrics. What happens when #fakenews causes real conflict to erupt? Lefty in PACOM sent fake alert?
2144 2018-01-15 19:19:34 Mix coconut oil and coarse sugar together for a body scrub that will leave your skin feeling super soft.
2145 2018-01-15 19:19:26 I have heating oil at my house...bought 300 gallons (800 dollars worth) of oil in November...just had to order another 300 gallons

2148 2018-01-15 19:18:52 Beyond a eugenicist's view of human worth, he appears "transactional" in his approach to immigration in that he views humans as chattel.  He's a very static thinker.  E.g., he thinks we can just "take the oil."  Everything is a discrete swap where you try and screw the other guy.
2149 2018-01-15 19:18:51 Coconut oil is really good
2150 2018-01-15 19:18:46 It's a great thing to have, there's no doubt about it.

But let's not build it up to be something it isn't, that was done with oil.

And we all know how that worked out. 
2151 2018-01-15 19:18:42 Here’s a few ideas on how to reduce the national debt: stop subsidizing oil companies that are recording record profits, stop entering wars without paying for them, stop giving tax breaks to rich people who don’t need them and use a portion of the revenue to pay down the debt.
2152 2018-01-15 19:18:41 I’m iffy about putting oil on my face bc my combo ass skin would be in shambles but imma try that! it’s really my face that gets super dry this time of year it’s so irritating
2153 2018-01-15 19:18:28 They too not far from highs.  Or higher oil =  smaller profit and same demand?  If they have good pricing power, than no problems for demand. Problems for demand  -  why you will at all raise rates, if it killing you?
2154 2018-01-15 19:18:26 Wrap it in foil before you check her oil
2155 2018-01-15 19:18:24 If they’re wrong how do you know if we made any money from oil or paid more tax than the UK for 34 years. All SNP claims and all from GERS.
2156 2018-01-15 19:18:23 Soli, pupils was one arrow poison, through the Syrian oil, flesh adheres to yonder eyes for affections of the flow it is
2157 2018-01-15 19:18:21 I need my body massaged with oil and lotion 
2158 2018-01-15 19:18:19 Mayor Of New York City Blames Storm On Oil Companieshttp://ihe.art/GOzRi5F
2159 2018-01-15 19:18:11 Also there was no shortage of hair oil in the late Weimar Republic
2160 2018-01-15 19:18:04 Did you tell Florida you'd be glad to release your income tax forms, too?  Did they believe you?  I can't wait until they put an oil rig right off-shore from Mar-a-la-go.  Oh yeah...you got Florida Exempted.  Sly, Mr President, sly.  Probably illegal, but sly nonetheless.
2161 2018-01-15 19:18:03 tasty tasty oil

2163 2018-01-15 19:17:36 hell yeah I'll swallow 3 teaspoons of warm oil, and then I'll wash it down with tide pods
2164 2018-01-15 19:17:35 Thank you but that's just some body oil 
2165 2018-01-15 19:17:32 Are we talking olive oil or some kind of ho-hum vegetable oil? 

A bit late for me today anyway

2172 2018-01-15 19:16:37 Professor Sacks would have us all switch from butter and lard to soybean oil. That'll kill people a lot faster (not to mention the terrible complexion problems ). Allegedly, he's a smart guy. WTF?
2173 2018-01-15 19:16:33 แล้วเหมือนแกะเสร็จ แต่พอพิมไปพิมมา ทำไมมันติด ทำไมค่ามันไม่เท่ากันละะ โอ้ยยยยยย
2174 2018-01-15 19:16:24 That coconut oil
2175 2018-01-15 19:16:17 Surely anti trust laws have been violated with the collusion of #Twitter #Google and #Facebook . Is anyone gonna look into that and breaking them up like they did with the oil companies and ma bell?
2176 2018-01-15 19:16:00 i'll take nine spoons of warm oil plz.  no 12.
2177 2018-01-15 19:15:59 Interestingly look at Venezuela's economy. It has the largest oil reserve but the poorest. 

To come out of that mess it needs support from Multilateral Institutions like IMF.

Venezuela can come with all sorts of financial instruments but all in vain. It needs help. Period!
2178 2018-01-15 19:15:48 Following the start of the second Russian civil war we shall begin sending the White army our oil for their war effort.
2179 2018-01-15 19:15:47 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps hot dogs with 9 oz daily bread. Mix into  Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve with a nice chianti.

2181 2018-01-15 19:15:31 Apart from big oil and big pharma, I don't think u could of picked a bigger battle.. good for you to do the right thing and not being just another dodgy banker 
2182 2018-01-15 19:15:30 I put too much money into 1985, but it was blue! Replaced almost every part at least once! The 2006 only had brakes replaced (too much stop & start in NYC traffic!), oil change. How much is a 3d hand Volvo in Holland w/ under 50,000 miles (convert to Km)?
2183 2018-01-15 19:15:29 it is pleasant to be a christian at this hour when there is continues flow of the oil in the house

2185 2018-01-15 19:15:26 I work in Aberdeen in the Oil & Gas service industry. There are still many people shrugging their shoulders. Only when it affects them, will they change that (perhaps not even then!).
2186 2018-01-15 19:14:42 Cacamucci, no amount of olive oil can lube the amount of indefensible shit you are trying to defend, justify and "rationalise"
@Macheter0
@Scaramucci
2187 2018-01-15 19:14:41 Dias is a moron!  Without NAFTA, what would keep 10002 of auto sector jobs in Canada.  This is the same guy who gloms union dues out of oil patch workers to finance campaigns to shut down oil operations.
2188 2018-01-15 19:14:41 Oil out under with over time forms Europe, he
2189 2018-01-15 19:14:19 Yeah, that's because the rest of the UK will stop wanting our oil, our water, our world class food and drink and all the other exports Scotland is world famous for. Yep, that'll happen.....

2195 2018-01-15 19:13:43 Does she do anything other than bitch about millionaires, billionaires, big oil and Trump?  Please Senator, what have you done for Massachusetts?  All you do is complain and raise money in other states.  Didnt accomplish anything when Pres Obama was in office either.
2196 2018-01-15 19:13:30 I've never seen any response to that tweet that wasn't equivalent to "Gimme all dat oil."

2199 2018-01-15 19:13:22 It’s almost like the Norwegians followed capitalist principles in developing and marketing their oil and gas resources.
2200 2018-01-15 19:13:20 Fingers crosses. Presume you've tried things like tiger balm and mint oil?

2206 2018-01-15 19:13:01 Department of Interior should not exclude Florida or anyone else. The people of the state should vote the exclusion or looking for the oil. Socialism started this DOE and and we the people don't need it. Look for oil and then think & vote.
2207 2018-01-15 19:12:52 Here's a thing.  Oil is like a must for healthy vegetarian cooking
2208 2018-01-15 19:12:28 Good. Oil, coal, and hopefully nuclear will also see tremendous growth which will benefit us all as well.
2209 2018-01-15 19:12:26 Flipping my bacon with a fork because I like oil burns and living my life on the edge
2210 2018-01-15 19:12:24 RT narendramodi: The Rajasthan refinery will be the first in the state, which is blessed with immense oil and gas reserves. This refinery will benefit Rajasthan, especially the industrious youth of the state.
2211 2018-01-15 19:12:23 Do they know that Italians dip bread right into a bowl of oil and eat it? I don't think this came out the way they hoped.
2212 2018-01-15 19:12:22 I eat healthy , I eat dat pussy & I use beard oil. That's how you get your facial hair game up

2217 2018-01-15 19:11:54 Ha ha....trick is to make it into a sauce by mixing it with a bit of sour cream or light mayo and a splash of olive oil! Always works a treat for me  #easycheesy

2228 2018-01-15 19:10:30 Going vegan is actually a lot easier than I thought. I’m not as strict w/ it as others are (I eat normally on weekends and don’t care what oil my French fries are fried in) but I’ve already noticed significant changes, mainly in my digestive system. That alone keeps me going
2229 2018-01-15 19:10:21 I had an ex who did this weird supplement diet that only allowed like 1tbsp of oil per day & she shouted at me when food tasted bad

2232 2018-01-15 19:09:59 Man screw that oil change
2233 2018-01-15 19:09:56 Wherever you see oil reserves in the country, you see the USA attacking that country, not Russia! People turn on your brains please, don't allow the western media propaganda to brainwash you

2235 2018-01-15 19:09:29 I did a deep hot oil conditioning to my hair and I think I left the oil on too long. My edges are over here looking like Chili from TLC!

2240 2018-01-15 19:09:03 I mean seriously I think warm oil is probably healthier than pizza.
2241 2018-01-15 19:08:54 I've been using a lighter facial oil in places where i'm not using a traditional moisturizer, and also, sounds wacky, but hydrating mists? they're light but they have moisturizing stuff in, and they're v easy to DIY dupe if you're up for it
2242 2018-01-15 19:08:52 It'll just be that shitey, volatile oil too.
Thank goodness we still have Westminster to look after it for us.
2243 2018-01-15 19:08:50 Amen! I’ve often prayed for increased anointing... during this fast the Holy Spirit led me to pray for increased capacity, and to be filled to overflowing with fresh oil! No more sippy cups!! I want the big gulp!  #increase #overflow #advance
2244 2018-01-15 19:08:38 When I roast potatoes or veggies I rub coconut oil all over them before they go in the oven. Then I rub my arms and elbows after before washing my hands. I call it my earthy moisturizer.

2249 2018-01-15 19:07:57 And some other countries. China and Russia have long been know as peace loving countries and the USA is the one responsible for bombing Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and the one responsible for Arab spring and mendling many more conflicts due to oil reserve interests.
2250 2018-01-15 19:07:51 Its because the Clinton Machine that stole millions from Africa& haities gold & oil. They paid FBI turn a blind eye. And defend when needed biases. While we pay you  percentage.

2254 2018-01-15 19:07:16 There is no economy in Haiti. It’s basically anarchy. 

And for those who want an economy “like Norway”....first thing u have to do is go discover oil reserves that rival Saudi Arabia’s. And then only have to divide the wealth among 5 million people.
2255 2018-01-15 19:07:15 yes!  this happened to me in highschool, they'll grow back, but it takes a long while!! make sure u moisturize them with coconut oil !!!
2256 2018-01-15 19:07:13 Oil prices in the mid 60s. Great for funded AIM companies with newsroom to come like #MXO and #COPL
2257 2018-01-15 19:06:57 Trying to schedule an appoint out of town when your sister is due to have her baby at any moment is super difficult. Like I just asked her, no labor symptoms for next Tuesday, I need an oil change, ok?
2258 2018-01-15 19:06:45 surprised to see that oil price hits $70

looking forward for a greater world where oil has its demand.......
2259 2018-01-15 19:06:37 What's the point? The oil will run out by 2019. Everyone knows that. What a waste of money by Shell. Sad!
2260 2018-01-15 19:06:32 honestly that's less oil than I thought so I can probably have a third piece
2261 2018-01-15 19:06:29 Gotta get my oil changed before I head to Miami next week
2262 2018-01-15 19:06:27 Well yeah, I'd like some warm oil. Now COLD oil... Got yourself a hard sell.
2263 2018-01-15 19:06:17 IT DOES. I was so annoyed because (even though all free stuff is great), my birthday gift was mascara. The next three months of birthday gifts was URBAN DECAY EYESHADOW. COME ON. I will say that their lip oil is awesome, at least.

2271 2018-01-15 19:05:09 Because 1H demand growth is usually much weaker than 2H; we're in an unusually long economic expansion, which is going to end some time; and higher oil prices from Sep 2017 onwards have to have a negative impact on demand.

2276 2018-01-15 19:04:25 Usually just stick some oil in the pan and season as desired then just kinda cook them until mostly softened(I like a tiny bit of crunch to it bc I don’t like them mushy)
2277 2018-01-15 19:04:23 everytime I go to heartland Toyota I leave with a new car....... stay focused jordan you just need an oil change
2278 2018-01-15 19:04:20 If you or a loved one is into essential oils, you can make beard oil from those as well.

2280 2018-01-15 19:03:46 Sure! I use beard oil. I’ve purchased some from a brand called Herbivore I like. Helps me keep skin underneath healthy. I prefer a low maintenance approach: instead of trimming and shaping the spots that grow longer or unruly, I just periodically trim the whole thing down.
2281 2018-01-15 19:03:38 Oh yeah, going to oil up the skin and sprinkle salt on it before baking so it goes all crispy. :>

2284 2018-01-15 19:03:24 Arsenal chasing Aubameyang? Already giving up on Monsieur Castor Oil so soon 
2285 2018-01-15 19:03:00 Aye there's always an opening for snake oil salesman. Yon Murdo 's a case in point.
2286 2018-01-15 19:02:50 Barbiegutz got sent some CBD oil and he didn’t want to use it because he doesn’t do drugs.. uhhh giveaway?? Like what lmao
2287 2018-01-15 19:02:19 Dry skin and lips in pictures freak me out. Like I know you know you need some chapstick.. I know you know you need to moisturize. I know you seen all that before the picture & in the picture. Ima start handing out lip balm and vit. E oil 
2288 2018-01-15 19:02:02 Recommendation: put some hair oil in your hair and let it soak in for 30 minutes then take a shower. It'll rejuvenate ur hair!!
2289 2018-01-15 19:01:56 Asda’s vegetable oil 100% rapeseed and is a fraction of the price of the rapeseed in glass bottles with fancy labels.
2290 2018-01-15 19:01:47 the list of regulations eliminated?All pro profit eliminating protections 4 Americans. Look up nursing homes,fiduciary, oil drilling

2293 2018-01-15 19:01:26 Boooooooooo on the oil companies ! Which made 100 billion dollars last year !
2294 2018-01-15 19:01:23 Note to self: when it says to only add a few drops of essential oil to your diffuser, ONLY ADD A FEW DROPS! I just tear gassed myself with lavender and tea tree oil. 
2295 2018-01-15 19:01:18 Probably true, but a big bust and USD spike between here and there. Remember oil spiking to $140 in early 2008 before collapsing in a deflationary bust? ECRI has called inflation cycle downturn ahead. USD always weakens first (and oil spikes) at the end of a stock market cycle.
2296 2018-01-15 19:01:09 They have a special file cabinet just for your stuff, Will.
2297 2018-01-15 19:00:58 Got to carry oil with you in times like this 
2298 2018-01-15 19:00:51 You can also get bumps in the genital area from oil piling up inside of ya pours. So let ya stuff breathe a bit y'all.

2304 2018-01-15 19:00:12 So which 'shithole' country you are from?
2305 2018-01-15 19:00:07 Now that I'm on it, send them bills for "free" medical care provided to illegals; welfare payments, etc.  I'd seize Pemex's oil wells if they didn't pay.
2306 2018-01-15 19:00:04 @lilybrown1001 could you please ask your beautiful mom how she uses her rosehip oil in her skincare routine? I just got myself a bottle Before or after moisturiser? Evening? Or both morning and evening?

Kisses from Cape Town! 
2307 2018-01-15 19:00:01 Besides it being the best moneygrabbing scam since snake oil you mean?

2309 2018-01-15 18:59:53 More seriously, 2018 is looking like the best year for oil in a good while. OPEC agreements holding and global economic recovery hint at strong price growth in the coming months.
2310 2018-01-15 18:59:53 They be tryna get my to buy everything lmaooo like noooo I just want my oil changed 
2311 2018-01-15 18:59:31 We have the Purpul hair oil in stock however the ABS will be available on Wednesday
2312 2018-01-15 18:59:15 I hate getting my oil changed by myself!
2313 2018-01-15 18:59:13 bio oil has really been such a blessing for my skin
2314 2018-01-15 18:59:01 tbh i used an oil mixture i had for my hair that i used (which had tea tree oil in it) and inhaled that. gonna get some oregano oil today to kill it off.
2315 2018-01-15 18:58:59 If you're ever sick & have a stuffy nose, take a shower & put a couple drops of tea tree oil in while it's steaming up & your nose should be clear once you finish showering!
2316 2018-01-15 18:58:52 Peppermint essential oil work wonders !
2317 2018-01-15 18:58:35 Unless a dude can walk into my life and positively change it in every aspect like a jar of coconut oil I don’t need him
2318 2018-01-15 18:58:24 @TuurDemeester looks like you were right about another commodity boom cycle #gold #oil
2319 2018-01-15 18:58:18 IMO lots of butter too, no oil.
2320 2018-01-15 18:58:05 Made my cous cous differently today and it tastes amazing! Toasted it in the same pan as I was frying my chicken with olive oil. Added rosemary. When it became brown I added boiled water and chicken stock and put it aside to fluff up. It has soooo much flavor 
2321 2018-01-15 18:58:01 bukan, tetep face oil
2322 2018-01-15 18:58:00 Not one mention of the redevelopment of Penguins oil field by Shell, bringing hundreds of jobs to #Scotland Did find time to report on potholes.... #joke #bbcscot #reportingscotland #indyref2
2323 2018-01-15 18:57:39 Sounds like snake oil
2324 2018-01-15 18:57:39 من زمان عن oil us ي ريس 
2325 2018-01-15 18:57:37 What exactly is virgin olive oil and who exactly has been having sex with olive trees/oil bottles?
2326 2018-01-15 18:57:30 Stuck at Walmart while my car gets an oil change. Who wanna pick me up and smoke?
2327 2018-01-15 18:57:04 V unglamorous #cookjan thanks to flu. Garlic, chilli and capers smashed up in a pestle and mortar, lightly fried in butter with breadcrumbs and parsley, tossed with spaghetti, lemon and olive oil. No photo because it went in about 2 seconds, my bad
2328 2018-01-15 18:56:58 So much more appetising than the time I returned to uni and only had tinned peas and eggs and no onions or oil. Ended up with a wishy washy meh dish 
2329 2018-01-15 18:56:37 Since when is it appropriate to advertise oil this account?  Second problem is, YOU have a child?  DEAR GAWD! Intervention time!  Third problem is that you're an idiot, which can't be fixed.
2330 2018-01-15 18:56:27 Frankly speaking as a business owner if you can't make it you can't make it. Free market.  Only oil and gas gets the subsidy in Alberta; all other businesses have to go the survival of the fittest route.  #Ableg #Abpoli #cdnpoli We're in a prolonged recession folks. Expect more.
2331 2018-01-15 18:56:17 Other dude at the oil change place just sneezed and before I could say “bless you,” he said “bless me.” Who does that?
2332 2018-01-15 18:56:16 Let's see Obama, stopped oil  energy driving in Alaska, and gulf of Mexico, regulated the coil industry out of business (almost) that created Jobs right? I'm sure that the AHA reduced  Heath care costs. Reduced our military , and unemployment was at 4.5% . Do your homework.
2333 2018-01-15 18:56:10 Montana Millz is where I get my hemp seed oil.
2334 2018-01-15 18:55:51 Kinda like warning sirens going off in error hourly.
2335 2018-01-15 18:55:50 Just a teeny weeny “new platform bringing about 70 operation jobs”

No mention of the *time machine* required to send the new platform back to before IndyRef, to a time before the oil ran out!

2337 2018-01-15 18:55:37 Not at all. Coal miners are actually being laid off, as are oil workers and other people he made promises to.
2338 2018-01-15 18:55:35 The way coconut oil feels on the skin after a shower >>>
2339 2018-01-15 18:55:33 Hot new trend: Cooking with coffee oil.

2341 2018-01-15 18:55:32 Did you know that Palm Oil is best positioned to satisfy the demand of our population(expected to reach 9 billion by 2050) because it's the highest yielding edible oil crop! #palmoil #palm #science #DYK
2342 2018-01-15 18:55:24 I use castor oil for my roots......
2343 2018-01-15 18:55:22 Lies. Listen to music with an unbiased mind. Give props to those putting in great efforts. M.I has released six projects. And he mentioned Naija oil only 2 times.
2344 2018-01-15 18:55:18 rest & massage with arnica oil
2345 2018-01-15 18:55:13 Property is a gift that keeps on giving, the government wants a cut of it I also think the land below it ultimately belongs to the government. Like, if there is oil underneath your home, it's not yours. Anyways, what do I know...?
2346 2018-01-15 18:55:08 if i moisturise over my oily-already moisturised skin will it cancel out the oil or make oil^2
2347 2018-01-15 18:55:08 Oil on the floor

2349 2018-01-15 18:54:51 If a tech company can disrupt the oil change industry, they'd make a killing.
2350 2018-01-15 18:54:12 Did you boy both oils? Vitamin c (orange juice) and oregano oil will knock out a cold/cough in one day as well. So keep those close.
2351 2018-01-15 18:54:09 One of the models in this week @EPICtheAlgo report has oil $USOIL at 74.83 April 9, 2018 (in the most bullish scenario on that model). Wow. $WTI $USO #OOTT #algorithm #chart #model
2352 2018-01-15 18:54:01 getting an oil change rn but su someone scoop me up to go eat smh
2353 2018-01-15 18:53:33 I know the puma deal was a British record. They may not look as good deals now due to the oil clubs having their respective countries plough money in but when signed ours was a record.
2354 2018-01-15 18:53:32 I bet jamie oliver brushes his teeth with olive oil
2355 2018-01-15 18:53:27 I stand in the heavenly place, on the sea of glass, in Your presence Abba, and decree fresh oil for first love, in Jesus' name. I loose it on the earth, I release it to Your Bride, Jesus. Thank You. It's there to take, just ask Him for it. Angels will minister it to you.

2357 2018-01-15 18:53:05 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other. #fz7
2358 2018-01-15 18:52:57 I used the shampoo bar from Lush called ‘New’ it has cinnamon and cloves in it. I also would put a little bit of coconut oil in my hair. Kind of massage it thru out the ends
2359 2018-01-15 18:52:49 Then they should invest in other sources of fuel, like solar or wind. Oil is going to run out anyway at some point. Nebraska isn’t allowed to exploit the coastal states for its own gain.
2360 2018-01-15 18:52:48 @VirginAtlantic you have the best crew! I flew BOS to LHR today with a bad cold/flu and was looked after so kindly. I was given hot olbas oil to inhale, bottled water and tissues- it made all the difference to me. Thank you. #CustomerService
2361 2018-01-15 18:52:46  has he PayPal’d it yet because my car needs new motor mounts, a oil change, & I need to catch up on some daycare fees & a light bill 
2362 2018-01-15 18:52:36 He's taking up dimm talking points. Not any mention of screening or selective immigration support. Being not Trump is main message

2364 2018-01-15 18:52:25 Like keeping people from selling cancer causing products, or leaking oil in our oceans, or fracking, or hiring child labor, or crazy financial practices that bankrupt the nation and enrich a few. You know, the kind of stuff that a total free market doesn't quite handle.
2365 2018-01-15 18:52:19 With the oil money they screwed us with with the complicity of leftists who oppose drilling in Canada. #cdnpoli #polcan
2366 2018-01-15 18:51:44 Worst I had was Gretna Green. Turned on the bottled gas to heat the oil and literally nothing was edible. Can't remember eating down there when I used to work at Dungeness
2367 2018-01-15 18:51:40 Couldn't care if we pay Sanchez 7m a week. It's a massive statement and seeing the tears from a club built on oil money complaining about money involved is the height of irony. It's hilarious. As long as he's a United player Idk what fees are involved.

2373 2018-01-15 18:50:58 for example if oil broke above 65, I would sell at least 1/2 if my holding was too big of a risk then wait to go back in at higher prices.

2377 2018-01-15 18:50:05 PUT THE THC OIL ON THE FONTO ADD THE GAS AND LIGHT THAT SHIT

2385 2018-01-15 18:48:34 I wish I had known to use oil/lotion more consistently on some of my older tattoos. A few are nearing ten years old & they're already fuzzy & fading!

2389 2018-01-15 18:47:45 There are quite possibly numerous violations of the Logan Act. Alot has been documented and proven. Just follow the oil money stock power grid and I hesitate to say it but the dead bodies & you will find it.

2395 2018-01-15 18:46:21 so Zionists knock out the Shah who was openly warning America about @AIPAC and then the zionists steal Iranian oil.

But somehow the 1979 coup was "anti-communist"?

not seeing it one bit.
2396 2018-01-15 18:46:17 Well it up to those God fearing citzens in those states...as a believer how do think you'll reapond to Christ questions on judgement day...by you have said in pass and your tweets now, you sound like one seven brides who forgot oil for her lamp...hurry little cotton tail...
2397 2018-01-15 18:46:16 Standard Oil didn't deserve what it got; competition would have made it decline, anyway.
2398 2018-01-15 18:46:08 I'm waiting on my oil change in Walmart and decided to grab lunch at subway. This lady in front of me literally asked for her cheese to be put in the other side of the bread and I'm so confused!

2400 2018-01-15 18:45:56 The Oprah in 3 years discussion is silly. Reagan answered that decades ago. She can if she decides to. Trump didn’t win because he is a personality. He won because he is a snake oil opportunist who put out a siren call to racists via birther lie. Better Q, can liars always win?
2401 2018-01-15 18:45:53 Looking forward to it. xx 
2402 2018-01-15 18:45:46 Many angles to the story. One is oil rigs. Most of those remaining in Vzla. are pretty much scrap, some are Chines low hp useless stuff. The better high hp units are in Ecuador, loaned by PDVSA free of charge (ideology backed deals from the days of Chavez-Correa).
2403 2018-01-15 18:45:32 And when we straighten out this scam, perhaps we can go after the snake oil merchants of homeopathy, "alternative medicine" and vitamin supplements that go right down the toilet.

2405 2018-01-15 18:45:08 Also,these fools operate in badfaith.Consider the EPA.Scott says we can't reliably measure impact of human caused GHGs.I call BS.NASA can measure gas on other planets&just detected clean water ice underground on Mars.Oil&GAS firms' success generally prove saavy tech&skills exist.
2406 2018-01-15 18:45:04 Took my car in for an oil change not because it was past due (it was), but because I desperately needed the complimentary wash
2407 2018-01-15 18:45:02 Ok I did that “which painting are you” thing and it was just an oil painting of a terrible credit score?
2408 2018-01-15 18:45:00 Creo que tiene más para subir...y no hay debilidad del OIL.

2412 2018-01-15 18:44:25 Yeah, I saw a few differences between articles.. Oil was before fashion as well. I just wanted to be dramatic so I went with it! Lol
But yes! I’m actually doing my senior project on this subject and saw that mushroom bit! Super cool idea.
2413 2018-01-15 18:44:15 I didn’t want to spend 2 hours getting my oil changed.
2414 2018-01-15 18:44:01 Yes sis it's shaved plus I used bio oil so that it glows...can't have an ashy coochie
2415 2018-01-15 18:43:48 I love when you get the oil changed in your car and the guy brings your air filter out to show you how dirty it is and then starts picking at it. Dude. I don’t care what’s caught in there. Just change it and move on.
2416 2018-01-15 18:43:42 Is the global poverty rate falling or climbing? It’s falling. Billions of people we’re not brought out of poverty by communist or socialist models lol. Venezuela is a massive failure. A country sitting on one of the worlds biggest oil deposits can’t feed its own people .

2427 2018-01-15 18:41:19 we have dignity because we have gold, diamond, oil, etc., which others exploit.
ok. i hear.

again, ok. i hear.
even in agreement we cannot claim automatic equal understanding.
let alone that we disagree

2430 2018-01-15 18:41:01 Not as great as you think. 10 yrs growing history here. Good for minimal Chem and fert. Price would have to improve to become viable again on this arable farm. Can have issues with harvest due to high oil content.

2434 2018-01-15 18:40:44 The only way this could be more posed is if it was an oil painting. How many pictures did you have to sift through to select this one?
2435 2018-01-15 18:40:44 That makes a lot of sense as I’ve never been to an Oil Kings game

2455 2018-01-15 18:37:52 Gawd reading this thread is depressing at the dearth of knowledge Americans have of global politics. Ever ask why N.Korea is even in U.S. crosshairs? Nuclear stuff? Nah..U.S. companies want NK mineral ores (200 types) worth $billions. Exploded the ME for oil, Iran next..then NK
2456 2018-01-15 18:37:47 I toast it in a little oil then use the oil too
2457 2018-01-15 18:37:39 This girl asked me how much would i charge her to do an oil change on her car i said 35$ #moneyisthemotive
2458 2018-01-15 18:37:35 What you on about now. Your lot literally begged us to stay and pretty much had the media decide it for us. Need that oil and whisky money we bring in :)..
2459 2018-01-15 18:37:33 It has always struck me as odd that the first companies with their nose in the trough pushing wind for subsidies were the oil companies ... except Exxon who appeared to be above such behaviour. And maybe that is why they are so hated - they don't bend to the Green fascists.
2460 2018-01-15 18:37:20 smoke weed or take weed oil, also u can take melatonin

2462 2018-01-15 18:36:55 Got ride of all unwanted hair on my face and body, washed my hair, currently deep conditioning with an intense moisturizing product, i have my moisterizing coconut oil face mask on, my kitchen is clean, my nails are about to get done. I wish i could have some champagne.
2463 2018-01-15 18:36:53 No definitely not, currency, Barnett, trade, armed forces, oil and more were higher up on the list but it seems this is the last chance they're likely to get so are milking it dry.
2464 2018-01-15 18:36:49 Just curious, what are your #s? I recall BNEF has ICE at 2/3 of LDV fleet in 2040. Given that's 45% of transport oil demand, estimates not wildly far off unless also progress w trucks, aviation, marine. Would be interested to see BNEF proj's for electrification of heavy duty. thx
2465 2018-01-15 18:36:44 So we are supposed to pretend every other country is equal? Candy really did set you on the right path. Cowed again.
2466 2018-01-15 18:36:41 My biggest regret is not checking the oil in my car last year. I wouldn’t be in this mess and I’d still have my vehicle
2467 2018-01-15 18:36:37 I find the lack of knowledge on this topic by investments companies really disturbing.  Last week alone you see oil trading being done in the yuan.  A currency loading up with thousands of tons of gold to support the currency.  China played the long game and will win.
2468 2018-01-15 18:36:16 Ackee cooked in coconut oil with two cornmeal dumplings! What a perfect world! 
2469 2018-01-15 18:36:15 Went to walmart to get my cars oil changed and waited almost TWO AND A HALF HOURS and then they tell me they are out of the right filter
2470 2018-01-15 18:36:15 If you understood coding, you would know some fundamental parts are identical. It’s like saying someone copied your fish & chips recipe because he’s using batter and oil to cook the fish. Educate yourself before you tweet some nonsense on my posts.
2471 2018-01-15 18:35:58 so oil in $ terms will go up to compensate fall in value of dollar..

2478 2018-01-15 18:35:32 Getting my oil changed is seriously my least favorite thing to do in the world
2479 2018-01-15 18:35:28 No mystery. The oil companies and the automobile companies cant let something like that out.
2480 2018-01-15 18:35:19 I wholly agree, transporting oil in rail cars is antiquated and a major safety concern. The deaths associated with rail cars rupturing is 10:1 vs pipelines. Today's modern coatings and cathodic protection extend the life of steel pipelines many years past original computations.
2481 2018-01-15 18:35:16 Snake oil saleswomen.
2482 2018-01-15 18:35:09 @RobertBaer Robert, Russia wanted Trump elected because they saw their economy badly damaged by the drop in Oil prices. This coincidentally happened following the dispute over Russia's incursion into Ukraine. What a surprise that we have Rex Tillerson  at State. Come on dude..

2484 2018-01-15 18:35:05 so I’m not a fake tanner but everyone is batshit about bondi sands so thought I’d try the gradual tanning oil...
2485 2018-01-15 18:35:03 yes! I have found oil helpful. The smoky flavor is usually consistent #FunTravelChat
2486 2018-01-15 18:34:57 I will never fight anyone who uses coconut oil as moisturizer, they truly have nothing to lose...
2487 2018-01-15 18:34:33 It's ok I went to do an oil change once on my old car and ruptured the fuel line. It doesn't get much worse

2489 2018-01-15 18:34:28 High end stripper or be really good at investing. Or maybe find natural oil on your property
2490 2018-01-15 18:34:11 Watching soap operas at the oil change place. Exhilarating entertainment

2492 2018-01-15 18:33:53 Not being smart but "single estate" usually refers to wine or oil, where all the ingredients come from one estate. Single estate for your gin is a bit disingenuous IMO as I presume the botanicals are imported.
2493 2018-01-15 18:33:43 It is sad to see so many so gullible.  You are being played.  people are making money off flying to you. If you don't care, by all means, don't do any real research.  All of this has been debunked.  This guy was testifying about fraud in an oil deal...nothing to do with the CF.
2494 2018-01-15 18:33:39 We can see the cost of Scotland being part of the UK...
Independent Norway has a oil wealth fund of $1,000,000,000,000, whilst Scotland has the square root of F.A thanks to big hands Westminster pissing it all against the wall. #indyref2
2495 2018-01-15 18:33:39 Maybe it's just an Oil Kings thing.
2496 2018-01-15 18:33:34 I’ll have oil over tea any day.
2497 2018-01-15 18:33:25 I was so excited for the complementary car wash with my oil change.  30 minutes later and I can’t even tell it happened.  #midwestwinters
2498 2018-01-15 18:32:52 I see a major bull market in OIL and Gold stocks is just starting #timetoloadup
2499 2018-01-15 18:32:44 Really would like to go get my car inspected & oil changed....yet new neighbors are moving in & blocking the driveway. WTF,YO
2500 2018-01-15 18:32:33 If you were silent or even worse, defended Donald Trump's racism, don't even utter Martin Luther King, Jr's name today. Don't quote him. Don't talk about his dream. Don't even.  Your racism doesn't mix with his dream. Oil and water.
2501 2018-01-15 18:32:24 Russians angry 45 failed to deliver on his assurances---likely to reduce or remove sanctions---he didn't hold up his end of the bargain=> BIGLY FAILURE. Russians are trying to kick him in the nuts now---and no big oil sales to US.
2502 2018-01-15 18:32:21 What is getting old is people peddling these long debunked lies.  what is getting old is folks buying this crap off of people making bucks off of the conspiracies.  First the guy was not testifying about CF but about an oil program !
2503 2018-01-15 18:32:17 YEESS!! I can’t wait to watch, Snake Oil 1 was hilarious  You guys should do another Don’t Even Get Me Started too

2512 2018-01-15 18:31:22 I’m usually pretty easy going when it comes to mechanic shops. Please do your job when I bring my vehicle in. I will bring it back in for you to do it properly if you don’t. Part of an oil change is to reset tire sensors and put air in tires.
2513 2018-01-15 18:31:19 Personal chemistry is never a reliable anchor for strategic alliances. India's Israel affinity it based upon Islamophobic sentiment while its major human resource and oil imports still gulf based&Chahbahar only expected to increase that. So how much latitude here?

2520 2018-01-15 18:30:24 About to soak my head in coconut oil in hopes these mats will come out. Winter hair is so much fun.
2521 2018-01-15 18:30:21 To the back of line.....
2522 2018-01-15 18:30:16 that's odd. What we call a "heat pump" here does have a/c. Was a lovely upgrade from my oil furnace to clean heat and a/c!
2523 2018-01-15 18:30:02 i had trouble with that too. i went to the place i got it pierced and they said to mix a few drops of tea tree oil with water and put it on the bump every day until it goes down

2526 2018-01-15 18:29:38 Had an appointment @HibdonTiresPlus they waited till I got there to tell me they couldn’t service my car. Gave me a coupon for a free oil change to apologize. It’s expired. #caseofthemondays

2528 2018-01-15 18:29:26 I love how when @JulienSolomita plays a snake oil, half way through the pitch, it's not even the same product anymore and from there it's just a roller coaster until you're the DMV trying to do your taxes
2529 2018-01-15 18:29:25 Run to Him and He will refresh, refill, and revive you! Psalm 23:5-6 says, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows….I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” (NASB)

2534 2018-01-15 18:28:43 ...our rivers.Think about off shore drilling & all the deregulation to offshore drilling, the risk is frightening.Once again the oil & gas companies will be free to make their own rule.Think about the last offshore disaster and the damage to the gulf and risk to 90% shoreline.

2540 2018-01-15 18:27:54 Any new views on oil? Long overdue pull back
2541 2018-01-15 18:27:40 you would think all this "US oil independence" would lead to lower prices for Americans but it just means higher profits for oil companies.

2555 2018-01-15 18:26:17 But I know I can inadvertently trigger MORE oil production if I dry it out too much - I have a really light moisturizer I’m trying with it but I’m not a cosmetics type person so idk what I’m doing lol

2575 2018-01-15 18:23:43 Think of it this way. Being of a similar age as you, this helped me . . .liken it to the Roman Empire owning & training gladiators to battle one another. 
Oh, and sorry you're having to wait for oil change. Here in Podunk, USA a long wait is 30 min. Lol

2579 2018-01-15 18:22:44 nobody is shilling for the clinton's.but calling them serial murderers shows the ignorance and lunacy of the right.  You can get accurate facts, instead you buy this garbage. it's beyond stupid. THIS guy was not testifying about CF, but about fraud in  OIL program with Venezuela
2580 2018-01-15 18:22:40 Therein lies your problem ... so Google can define it any way it choose ... but look at Venezuela ... people have nothing and they are rich in oil.  Democratic Socialism destroys everything ... people flee from it.

THIS guy was not testifying about the foundation, had lost his own job due to fraud and was testifying about fraud in an oil program.

2610 2018-01-15 18:19:39 Thoughts: I will always be imperfect. I'll make mistakes, I'll fail to live up to my potential, I won't have enough empathy or wisdom or patience or inner fortitude. But that's not an excuse for my lack of confidence. Confidence and imperfection are not oil and water.

2636 2018-01-15 18:15:22 I was thinking about the BP oil spill. We probably wouldn't even know about a catastrophic oil spill at the moment--because every headline would be about Trump & what he might do.

2639 2018-01-15 18:15:08 Im only saying that as it's a finite resource we would never be able to keep it around forever. Sure there will be more coal and oil millions of years from now but that does little to solve the problems of today

2696 2018-01-15 18:08:14 pathetic if the 1% make BILLIONS form it and the employees get little more than basic middle class jobs. BUT...the 1% own the UK and we are part of the Petrodollar Wars that kill millions a year for cheap oil.
2697 2018-01-15 18:08:09 Finally brought my car into the shop... I was 2,000 miles over the recommended oil change and 2 months past inspection. Who let me own a car

2707 2018-01-15 18:06:04 why should you get a forum for peddling conspiracy theory that the Clinton's r serial murderers?  You mixed up this activist with another Haitian.  This guy who killed himself lost his job due to his own fraud, was testifying about fraud in an OIL program that had 0 to do with CF

2712 2018-01-15 18:05:37 Do away with plastics (and everything else) from fossil fuels completely. Let the lords of oil scream of desperation when no one want's their shit no longer. I new era must come now or our already ditchdriven civilization will plow itself stuck down there.
2713 2018-01-15 18:05:33 I had it a few months back and found that like olbus oil and steam sort of helped for a bit if you like inhaled the steam
2714 2018-01-15 18:05:30 Yep we have written many stories on the status of oil facilities in Venezuela
2715 2018-01-15 18:05:29 my car needs an oil change. but my car has a flat tire. and im supposed to go back to school tonight. but i need an oil change and a new tire and gas in my car and im... a lil panicked rn ngl
2716 2018-01-15 18:05:15 oil is overbought on chart right now.. needs to fall a bit then continue the rise. Maybe down to low sixty before up.
2717 2018-01-15 18:05:03 Ultimate warrior  I would have loved to writhe around on a plastic sheet and a barrel of baby oil with her and Liz Hurley. It would be over after 10 thrusts tops
2718 2018-01-15 18:04:55 @el_venter Sounds like you've done a lot of exploring! We recommend stopping by for an oil change to keep your car going strong. :)
2719 2018-01-15 18:04:42 When you go to get an oil change & end up having to buy new tires too 
2720 2018-01-15 18:04:37 The oil change only $130, it ain’t tricking if u got it
2721 2018-01-15 18:04:29 lol it's something that gives you the shitties. The subtle version of castor oil

2724 2018-01-15 18:03:58 Lmao dig deep and find oil. See the music scene in Gh doesn't care all they want is what they can jam. That's why one corner became hit.
2725 2018-01-15 18:03:56 CRP refining center (Amuay + Cardon refineries) operate at unprecedented low capacity due to equipment problems AND lack of oil. Production and transport on the verge of collapse. In addition to all that, they now face massive resignations of qualified personnel.

2736 2018-01-15 18:03:15 I think 2B just leaked some oil....

2738 2018-01-15 18:02:57 I'm more worried about deregulation to the EPA and opening our national parks so his friends could cut down trees,mine minerals, gas,oil, open up fragile areas to off road activities which will destroy Indian historical sites and dinasour digs.....

2744 2018-01-15 18:02:35 What lotion do you use?? I just use coconut oil! Xx
2745 2018-01-15 18:02:33 If we only had your cautionary approach when DW was premier, we would be a lot better off today. "Plan for the worst, and hope for the best". Higher oil prices only mean that you have time to take a breath. A long hard road ahead for NL's finances.

Let's Ask Venezuelans How Cool Socialism Is:
Venezuelans Had Their Guns Confiscated, They're Smuggling In Powdered Milk, Waiting In Rationing Lines For Toilet Paper, Hunting Rabbits To Eat & The Oil Rich Country Is Running Out Of Gas!
2751 2018-01-15 18:01:56 Me too!! I apply the lotion and oil religiously, just hope its not going to fail me at the last hurdle

2753 2018-01-15 18:01:47 A massive land mass that can produce 900 carat diamonds, oil, large scale farming, tourism, and endless possibilities remains a shithole. A nation is it's people

2755 2018-01-15 18:01:33 Pretty colors!! I would suggest avoiding s grid and starting with large overall shapes and refining and refining. Oil is a very different medium and often benefits from a different approach.
2756 2018-01-15 18:01:32 FYI FELLOW VETS. IF YOU DABBLE IN CBD OIL OR ANY PRODUCT THAT HELPS WITH ILLNESS YOU CAN NOW LOSE YOUR BENEFITS AT THE VA.
2757 2018-01-15 18:01:28 Venezuela went from a country on the way to prosperity and growth from its oil to collapse and people starving on the streets in less than a decade upon turning full Socialist.  Seems like there might be a clue, there.
2758 2018-01-15 18:01:24 And you pay $200 for an oil change.

2766 2018-01-15 18:00:43 Yeah. Jackson 100 is Lucas oil. Not sure if the tuneup is sanctioned. No Way Out 40 is non sanctioned 410 traditionals but it's in March so everyone shows up. Awesome event.
2767 2018-01-15 18:00:42 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
2768 2018-01-15 18:00:42 People really pay for oil change?
2769 2018-01-15 18:00:38 Try painting larger and forgoing as much detail tbh. I find oil is easiet when you work large, thick, and expressive. I agree about starting with still lifes. Blur your eyes and lay down the basic shapes and values, and then build up more and more detail on top.
2770 2018-01-15 18:00:21 So far the best deep condition I've made was eggs, honey, mayo, black castor oil and Aloe Vera .... leaves hair soft, and curls so defined
2771 2018-01-15 18:00:00 I'm offended by both parties. Aziz is a sick pervert who was way too desperate to get some action on a first date. And the woman was clearly too enamored with Aziz the celebrity(or who she mistakenly thought he was) to take ownership of the situation and get up and leave.
2772 2018-01-15 17:59:58 I believe the era of the oil boom for our city has passed and I believe we stepping into the season of startup boom. #WarriWorks #Wafficon
2773 2018-01-15 17:59:57 I am aware that this is what GM told many cities (and in LA, actively bought and tore up the existing rail network). And that subsidiaries of Standard Oil just happened to agree with GM's assessment.

2779 2018-01-15 17:59:10 saddam was very unpopular with EVERYBODY, we wanted to replace him, establish ourselves as heroes for removing him, control kuwaiti & iraqi oil ourselves, then revisit iran issue
removing saddam took much longer than planned, required 2nd war in fact

2785 2018-01-15 17:58:07 I see the mayor of New York is suing the big oil companies for knowingly causing climate change. What would happen to New York if the big oil companies said "ok, we're not giving you any more oil" ?
2786 2018-01-15 17:57:59 Skin definitely clearing up. Thank you diet, prayer and coconut oil. Out here flourishing.

2788 2018-01-15 17:57:45 I look at Ghana becoming better everyday nd I weep for Nigeria. Investors trooping in, availability of jobs,  government owned factories everywhere, quality yet free education,  good health facilities, security and peace. Imagine if they had oil like Nigeria. 
2789 2018-01-15 17:57:40 Thanks mate. Yeah, oil is really on a killer run. I’m waiting for a retest around 62,35 area before going long.
2790 2018-01-15 17:57:36 Richard. You might want to re-rhink this.  Frump is allowing biz to pollute streams drill for oil off our coasts deforest our national forest,  take away voting rights from legal citizens, demeaning our standing in the world.  He is destroying not building
2791 2018-01-15 17:57:21 PDVSA is totally in the hands of inept military with NIL oil experience.

2795 2018-01-15 17:56:36 If 795 000 liters of #oil leak- will 795 000 rich oil barons leak too! All their wealth tied up in greed? I hope so.

2800 2018-01-15 17:54:11 he said "look, i can't take iran for you, not atm, & we need oil & money. i CAN take kuwait, np, its sort of already ours, they will not resist. do you have ANY issue with this plan?"
we gave him the green light, then immediately used it as the sole reason for Persian Gulf War
2801 2018-01-15 17:54:11 Lucas Oil?
2802 2018-01-15 17:53:49 Certainly errodes any reliability or willingness of investors to take risks. During the time when Iran was under oil exports sanctions there were weekly/monthly reports from Iran on gigantic discoveries.... where are they today??

2805 2018-01-15 17:53:22 Yeah it's a pretty good deal when oil revenue determines your pocket money

2811 2018-01-15 17:52:00 So relieved there aren't any problems with my car  Last time I got an oil change I had to spend a ton on repairs
2812 2018-01-15 17:51:41 saddam suggested the idea to us, he was already our best friend in OPEC, many of you do not recall WE were sanctioned repeatedly by OPEC (google Oil Embargo)
saddam was our beyond comparison, our greatest ally in mideast
he alone violated the embargo, alone warred iran for us
2813 2018-01-15 17:51:39 Oh I absolutely am! But thats somewhere cool and people will be happy for me! I just don't really care when people are getting their oil changed. At all.
2814 2018-01-15 17:51:34 Good thing it was an Iranian tanker and not a US tanker so that liberals won't be screaming bloody murder over the oil spilled into the water. Being that it's an Iranian tanker liberal screams will be deafeningly quiet. (Crickets)
2815 2018-01-15 17:51:18 £70 for an oil spillage and leak at spillways, and from driving from there to the bp engine cuts out twice, so stop at nationals and just paid £86 for a new battery, happy Monday’s
2816 2018-01-15 17:51:17 People who use those oil cartridges, what would cause the pen to start blinking with a white light? When it is out of battery life it blinks red so don't say that

2823 2018-01-15 17:50:22 They cut ties with palm oil in Guatemala...not Indonesia.
We need ties cut in Indonesia.

I guess im a pessimist. I just dont think a boycott on palm oil will save the Indonesian natural habitat.

2827 2018-01-15 17:49:37 *Hmmm... Wonder if President Donald J Trump’s “America FIRST” Policy has anything to do with the American Government supporting local American Oil & Gas Producers? Or is this just fluff from the President’s mouth? Is a Canadian Prime Minister more powerful than a U.S. President?

2832 2018-01-15 17:49:01 yea Tulsi, this time... NOT SO MUCH.. we don't want to invade NK, because they have no oil and it won't drive the price up for the CARTEL...   dont believe all the DNC talking points,, (in fact dont believe ANY of them)
2833 2018-01-15 17:49:00 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
2834 2018-01-15 17:48:56 I may add oil drops to it. Do you have a favorite moisturizer?
2835 2018-01-15 17:48:49 so in order to get international approval to replace saddam, we tricked him into "invading" kuwait

4 things to consider here

1. kuwait WAS part of iraq (sort of)
2. kuwait had oil!
3. we had no relations with kuwait
4. kuwait did NOT resist the invasion at all
2836 2018-01-15 17:48:40 Let's see: nationalizing the oil industry left it staffed by political cronies with no oil experience so production plummeted, and price controls based on nothing but ego and wishful thinking exacerbated shortages...

Huh, it's almost like central planning kinda sucks.

2872 2018-01-15 17:44:26 I'd go with floating test too. Seen some prepper documentary where they took every egg and covered it with oil & then back in package. Combine that with fridge and who knows how long it last

2891 2018-01-15 17:41:58 I’m not against oil. I’m against waste of oil such as plastic bags or pumping it out our tail pipes. We need oil to manufacture products.
2892 2018-01-15 17:41:56 I tyhink maybe underestimated. They get given a quota for how much they themselves can import. Once that quota is up they need to purchase more oil (or fuel oil) and they do that from the state companies, which could be imported oil.
2893 2018-01-15 17:41:56 Minimum wage can be stagnant when inflation occurs and some politicians can reduce minimum wage (see St. Louis). A universal basic income is giving a living wage to people when they turn 18 (an example for this is Alaska where oil companies give money to the citizens)

2901 2018-01-15 17:41:22 however, since (as noted above) there was 0 legal credibility or international approval for us overthrowing a democracy, instituting a dictatorship through our puppet & stealing iranian oil

so we had saddam do it

2921 2018-01-15 17:38:40 concealer is cream you put under your eyes itll correct the darkness, the strobe cream is a glowy moisturizer but its concentrated so you can just dab it on the places u want to be glowy. or literally use jojoba oil its thin and doesnt make u look greasy
2922 2018-01-15 17:38:36 It’s not luck, it’s knowing how to manipulate drug tests. Quite easy really and most smart people in the oil patch or others in safety sensitive situations know how to keep their jobs and continue using medicine prescribed to them.

Also, you can finish with bee’s wax for a more water/stain resistant seal (wooden bowls, cups, etc)

2955 2018-01-15 17:35:22 It is neatly built, no doubt, but it's all in the assumptions. You can argue that expectations will never ever be close to 2% + oil remains low and voilà. Endless counterarguments can be made, and I really doubt we'll be at 1% inflation next year.
2956 2018-01-15 17:35:20 Nice charts man I am also watching some of those names. Oil really is on a killer run, keep an eye on some of those energy names if you play stocks

2963 2018-01-15 17:34:08 RSI(5) for $OIL is currently the highest  since 2012, and I've got to go all the way back to the oil price shock of 1990 to find a point where this level of RSI wasnt quickly  followed by at least a mean reversion to the 20 day MA (~$61 now).

2964 2018-01-15 17:34:05 Sure bad things have been done. But different times those were.

2970 2018-01-15 17:33:28 ... The sad part is, for all our technology, if we upgraded our power generation technology from 1750 era coal and oil burning, we could still solve all of our problems with 150 year old technology, called Corona Motors... And still not require anything new to be invented...
2971 2018-01-15 17:33:26 Oh yes, it's fascinating. I remember seeing some pics on abandoned scotland of a 'deserted village' which had been built by someone like shell on the coast for the impending west coast oil boom which the MOD put paid to. I never knew any of that before seeing those pics & reading
2972 2018-01-15 17:33:25 #Oil $CL_F is the trade. I mean, it's always the trade.

2981 2018-01-15 17:31:39 Who said that friendship came without repayment ? 41% of israeli defence products are procured by india alone.  And my friend ours is an oil based economy so what happens in middle East do affect us in a very bad way, from inflation to even recession.

2992 2018-01-15 17:29:56 Oh ain't great how oil can feed 66 billion, yet is another but a worthless burden to the Scottish economy according to Westminster
2993 2018-01-15 17:29:49 Wouldn't renewable energy also provide jobs to Alaska and power for US citizens while not endangering wildlife with spills? What you are doing here is selling out protected lands so big oil can drill and export oil for profit and the taxpayers will get the bill for spills.

2995 2018-01-15 17:29:38 Well if you want to continue buying oil from OPEC then by all means do it but not with my hard earned dollar. I prefer to buy American oil not foreign oil.

3009 2018-01-15 17:28:49 I've never had a problem with it. It clings on pretty well, no flaking all day long I use waterproof eye make up remover to dislodge it, or my latest fave, oil infused miscellar water.

-Is Currently in "NEGOTIATIONS" with Coastal States leaders TO OIL RIG OR NOT OIL RIG YOUR COAST?? Let's make a DEAL!?!
3017 2018-01-15 17:27:10 Oh I was like that a few weeks ago - try the @elfcosmeticsIRE lip exfoliator and then pop the @ClarinsFR lip oil over! Defo a winning combo x
3018 2018-01-15 17:26:39 while u.s. invested in saudi oil production, uk invested in iran, which was then ruled by the uk
basically, they made a deal with themself
by 1951, iranians were not happy with the deal, so they nationalized the oil production
there was a new court set up after ww2, by u.s. & uk
3019 2018-01-15 17:26:25 The white paper was based on oil & GERS. Apparently, GERS is a load of shit! So which is it?
3020 2018-01-15 17:26:20 That’ll be the same people that calculated the Scotland oil revenues before the #indyref and they were only 93% out on their sums. Funny how we’ve never had an apology for that......

3024 2018-01-15 17:25:56 I don't understand? If wind generators can't be build on the #JerseyShore 
bc they are an eye sore? 
How can an oil rig be any better? 
#pleaseexplain
3025 2018-01-15 17:25:51 I'm not saying that's not a trait that runs through the party. They're a well oil machine and in this case I suspect they would have been directed from within. I actually think putting the Party above the Country, and then blatantly lying, is even worse
3026 2018-01-15 17:25:50 I’m always obsessed with how soft rose hip oil makes my face.
3027 2018-01-15 17:25:37 None of the Agencies (in Iraq) has confirmed the oil spill.
3028 2018-01-15 17:25:36 Enig. Oljen har tilført samfunnet enorme verdier, men også medført neglisjering av fastlandsindustrien. I en artikkelserie på 90-tallet hevdet The Economist at Norge så ut til å utvikle mono-økonomi. Artikkelserien ble slått stort opp i Dagsrevyen. Dens tittel var "By oil alone?"
3029 2018-01-15 17:25:32 Lol Ikno we ait looking for oil
3030 2018-01-15 17:25:22 ..... Oil! I meant oil! It's.... Slicker?
3031 2018-01-15 17:25:14 "Exactly. And then, as you know i have that strawberry oil too."

Rayne chuckled. Looking back past her shoulder. All she could see is Kal's hand and a few scars that didn't go unnoticed.
3032 2018-01-15 17:24:57 Coconut oil on my face is a no no but on my body omgAzzzzzz it's amazin
3033 2018-01-15 17:24:45 After the Conservative failure on the oil industry and Harper’s moronic bluster, just what would you like the current government to do? How have they specifically “bungled” anything?
3034 2018-01-15 17:24:44 People are going to continue using oil and gas for a long time so the only question is what nations will profit the most by supplying them.
3035 2018-01-15 17:24:39 Heard oil firms in lagos are recruiting in preparation for the refinery and the Eko Atlantic City. I don't have the details, just trying to help. 

When one door closes, 10 doors open. You'll get a much better one soon.
3036 2018-01-15 17:24:27 The Rajasthan refinery will be the first in the state, which is blessed with immense oil and gas reserves. This refinery will benefit Rajasthan, especially the industrious youth of the state. by #narendramodi

3038 2018-01-15 17:24:19 Many mental health problems are being magnified by the current economic conditions in Alberta, with very little being done to help boost the economy specifically in the oil industry
3039 2018-01-15 17:24:10 Like oil and water
3040 2018-01-15 17:24:06 Wow.   Of course it is due to socialism.  Socialism invites corruption, destroys innovation, and robs people of individual rights.

Them socializing (stealing) foreign oil assets ended in no oil company willing to deal with them. That led to their fiscal crisis.
3041 2018-01-15 17:24:03 1) Stop sending Abbas money.
2) Let Iran support them.
3) Increase Iranian sanctions. 
4) Increase our oil production. 
5) Sit back and watch Abbas come begging for money.

You're a fuck & good luck & god bless you all

3054 2018-01-15 17:22:05 I came for one thing and one thing only, and that was to get my oil changed! 
3055 2018-01-15 17:21:57 Independent refiners, sometimes referred to as teapots, imported about 70.5 million tonnes of crude in 2017, up from 42.1 million in 2016, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts #OOTT
3056 2018-01-15 17:21:46 Came to get an oil change and they break more stuff in my car 
3057 2018-01-15 17:21:33 Getting my oil changed is the most awkward thing... Is that normal? Or just me?
3058 2018-01-15 17:21:19 Coconut oil if you don’t want them as visible. Or bio oil. But embrace your lightning strikes. Or tiger stripes whenever suits your fancy
3059 2018-01-15 17:21:05 Friend said to rub lavender oil on my feet. I said I rather not sleep then to trust your weird remedy. It's a real thing tho.

Where did it appear from?

3078 2018-01-15 17:18:02 Took my truck to get an oil change. Apparently I hear a squeal and now need front breaks and roaters. Now I drove this truck this am I really must be deaf....

3088 2018-01-15 17:15:37 You are the antithesis of everything Dr. King stood for. You pillage the wilderness rightfully belonging to indigenous Alaskans so oil companies donate to your campaigns. You rob young Americans of their future so Koch gets a tax cut. Your president is a white supremacist. SHAME.

Bizarre
3099 2018-01-15 17:14:44 @Samir_Madani hi Sam, the earlier report on the oil spill off Basrah terminal seems to be incorrect.

3101 2018-01-15 17:14:20 If African countries really want to make a point, they can just yank oil and mining permits. I'm sure that Chinese and Russian firms would jump right in. Trump is a clear and present danger to U. S. interests abroad.
3102 2018-01-15 17:14:19 I used a makeup wipe to take off my lipstick last night instead of coconut oil (which is what I usually use) and my lips are so dry and cracking. Please send help lol
3103 2018-01-15 17:13:55 I’m so glad my husband is a mechanic! Even though he’s actually a diesel mechanic, he has auto mechanic skills too! I never have to leave my house for oil changes.
3104 2018-01-15 17:13:28 All the Dawn soap in the world couldn't clean up this oil spill, Gordon

3107 2018-01-15 17:13:09 If you're born in Texas, the doctor force feeds you a bottle of gasoline, as a ritualistic honoring of Stephen F. Austin, the first president of Texas, who was said to drink a whole can of crude oil every day.
3108 2018-01-15 17:13:00 Like why it take so long to drain some oil and put new oil in it?
3109 2018-01-15 17:12:59 I can't wait to have my own children & give them Caster oil .
3110 2018-01-15 17:12:59 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
3111 2018-01-15 17:12:52 こういうビジュアル簡素な奴とかだと却って描写が重要になるかもしれませんねえ
3112 2018-01-15 17:12:47 Also, you are aware that the US has been funding a guerrilla war in Venezuela for decades, right? Venezuela sits on massive oil fields and everything has come to a head while Trump - who openly regrets not stripping Iraq of its oil is in charge of this country right?
3113 2018-01-15 17:12:34 Random Monday thought: I feel like an oil painting recreating Moby Dick with Bernie Sanders as Cpt. Ahab, harpoon in hand, and Donald Trump as a giant orange whale with a hairpiece would be a delightful image. #IWishICouldPaint
3114 2018-01-15 17:12:33 Stir Fried Rice with Chicken, Mushrooms 'n Cashews. Sesame Oil, Garlic, onion grated ginger base. Splash of Soy Sauce. Glass of beer.
3115 2018-01-15 17:12:32 No it doesn't. Crude oil price was above $100 a barrel for the first projection and was less than $50 a barrel for the second projection. Add the pipeline vandalism and that's an explanation in a country highly dependent on oil.
3116 2018-01-15 17:12:27 He lives on the Gamesmaster Oil Rig
3117 2018-01-15 17:12:26 must also cook&temper it by adding some oil at a little high temperature &then it becomes more tastier with time&you could store it in glass lid bottles tightly&store & use it even for a year without any spoilage.Its yummy&the same way Gherkins cud b made&stored without heat&oil
3118 2018-01-15 17:12:09 Isaiah 61: 3. To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
3119 2018-01-15 17:12:08 This is why the Liberal Party never liked Harper, he was more business oriented and at least tried to support the OIL and natural resource sectors to sell and get that revenue because otherwise the cost of these events are on OUR BACKS as taxpayers!!
3120 2018-01-15 17:12:07 I hate getting oil changes
3121 2018-01-15 17:11:56 thanks to steph , He done got me a oil change, took my car to get serviced today & my breaks later on 
3122 2018-01-15 17:11:55 They tried to convince me I was a dying man who needed a cure and they were going to provide it for me but I have to want it, sheep blind pathetic sheep. I wasn’t born yesterday, he was a slick oil salesman care about me? He cares about $$$
3123 2018-01-15 17:11:50 Donno what will happen if oil prices go to $147 per barrel?
3124 2018-01-15 17:11:43 Down goes oil.
3125 2018-01-15 17:11:43 Clever girl!
3126 2018-01-15 17:11:41 I should’ve packed a lunch! Going on 2 hours at oil change place!
3127 2018-01-15 17:11:41 If anyone is interested, I have some Eucalyptus oil left over from my market trip the other day.
It helps with respiratory problems when used in a aroma diffuser or on a wet towel

3135 2018-01-15 17:11:10 Also, “Rehab” shampoo! It’s full of EVOO and jojoba oil to make your hair stronger, peppermint oil and juniper to stimulate your scalp and tons of fruit juices to make your hair soft and shiny!
3136 2018-01-15 17:11:03 I recommend our hot oil treatment “damaged” it’s got Almond oil, EVOO, and avocado oil to leave your hair V moisturized and strong!
3137 2018-01-15 17:11:03 Marathon Oil continues to grow. Just for the past month, its stock was grown by 22.46% #marathonoil #MRO #mrostock
3138 2018-01-15 17:10:42 2. A Frontline Environmental activist, Celestine Akpobari in an interview with our correspondent said the plan to begin oil exploration when impacted sites are yet to be cleaned is insensitive.
3139 2018-01-15 17:10:34 We need to shift $ in health care, education and clean energy. Once clean energy takes off we will be self sustainable country w/o the need to steal oil from others countries. Wake up people! Big oil is using our tax $ to fight their wars for profits. That money can be use here!

3141 2018-01-15 17:10:30 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

3145 2018-01-15 17:10:13 What other problems does Venezuela  face other than socialism? They have huge quantities of oil and other natural resources!

3147 2018-01-15 17:10:01 Ogonis kick against planned oil resumption

1. Ogonis are kicking against resumption of oil activities in the their land especially the exploration of OML Eleven.
3148 2018-01-15 17:09:30 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
3149 2018-01-15 17:09:25 We suggest using moisturizing oils, like Coconut Oil Avocado Oil Lavender Oil etc Because  they contain no water.  Best  used while the skin is still damp from bathing, to seal in the moisture. Many of our sugar scrubs contain these oils.
3150 2018-01-15 17:09:12 coconut oil. on everything.
3151 2018-01-15 17:09:08 OIL DIFF: 5.61 -> 5.63
3152 2018-01-15 17:08:46 I really wish I had an oil rig
3153 2018-01-15 17:08:42 True, the weaker dollar and $60 oil have spurred on global growth and by extension growth in the US is picking up.
3154 2018-01-15 17:08:32 Your oil or the oil in your car?
3155 2018-01-15 17:08:31 Or use the mct capsules if the oil makes you nauseous, like it does to me.
3156 2018-01-15 17:08:30 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
3157 2018-01-15 17:08:28 It's indeed because of policies related to Chavismo. The firing of ''enemies'' at the national oil company, the policies which made investors and capital flying away, the scapegoating of ''others'' for the regime weakness.
3158 2018-01-15 17:08:25 Will do, thank you very much! I haven't ever mixed oils with coconut oil before, that looks like a good idea :)
3159 2018-01-15 17:08:19 Yeah I did the press thing last week but then got caught in the rain lol — I need to get on this oil flex though I’m just a bit overwhelmed as to where to start
3160 2018-01-15 17:08:18 Yes, lets invite others to see the coal mines in Virginia and the drilling rigs in our national parks, oil spills in the gulf coast.  Stripped forests and strip mining.  Make America great again.  
The best way to help keep American great is to stop trump and company.
3161 2018-01-15 17:08:11 Agar Crude Oil ka price 130 $/ Barrel ho jaaye to Modi Sarkar , Petrol aur Diesel kya bhaav bechegi ?
3162 2018-01-15 17:08:08 Rosemary oil but it needs to be diluted and regularly used
3163 2018-01-15 17:07:49 I’m going to get my oil changed today. I used to do it myself years ago. Do you change your own oil?
3164 2018-01-15 17:07:43 When your appointment was supposed to take 2 hours (which is absurd for an oil change/wiper recall) and yet I’m still fucking here!!!! @ToddWenzelAuto I will not buy a car from here in the future nor will I recommend anyone else does!

3166 2018-01-15 17:07:25 While NK stopped producing plutonium in exchange for oil, they began producing uranium while helping other terrorist countries begin nuclear programs of their own. Clinton assumed NK regime would collapse before reaching nuclear capability. He was wrong, so here we are.

3174 2018-01-15 17:06:29 Thank fuck we're not an oil dependant country.

3180 2018-01-15 17:05:57 It's a "s'hole" island that Trump doesn't want. If it had oil or coal on it, he'd be fixing it in a heartbeat!

Puerto Rico, America is still thinking of you though......
3181 2018-01-15 17:05:50 Out of experience I’d probably get medicinal grade olive oil, just a bit better to use and a lil bottle is probably like £3/4 and lasts AGES
3182 2018-01-15 17:05:47 Case for stronger oil price looking good. I opened a CFD position on Sasol last week on the back of that.

3186 2018-01-15 17:05:17 I want to get an oil diffuser so I can engage my sense of smell in meditation.
3187 2018-01-15 17:05:09 Instead of doing the massive amounts of work I brought home, cleaning my room, running my errands or even doing anything for leisure I just watched a ten minute video on how Olive oil is made
3188 2018-01-15 17:05:01 /2/ Iran’s oil fields back in the fifties.  People involved were still alive that were involved and if it had come out, it would have made the problems even worse.
3189 2018-01-15 17:04:59 That is false information. The client was waiting for the tanker to arrive at their refinery in Daesan, South Korea.

South Korea is a Top 3 customer of Iranian oil, and Iran wouldn’t do anything to upset that relationship as South Korea was legally buying oil during sanctions.
3190 2018-01-15 17:04:54 @OfficialHARIBO please can you tell me if you use palm oil and, if so if you are part of the RSPO? #votingwithmyfeet

Roti : without oil
Naan: cooked in a pot under charcoal heat
Parata: thick, usually mixed with vegetables, with oil
Chapati: thin crest, with oil.

3195 2018-01-15 17:04:36 #Crude #Oil made a NEW HIGH this morning of $64.81!!! A lot of my focus now is watching #Rbob & #HeatingOil trying to see if they have the actual demand to push $CL_F back to new highs... clearly $65.00 level is next. Meanwhile stronger #stocks, #copper, $CAD, $MXN all catalysts.
3196 2018-01-15 17:04:26 US move to essentially create a "statelet" using the SDF proves an initial theory that the US was all out to sieze Syrian oil. The US will not bow to defeat and will seek to carve out a "win" for itself.
3197 2018-01-15 17:04:17 Peel & cube up a butternut squash, sweet potatoes & carrots (& other veggies as you wish). start to soften in coconut oil on medium low heat on the stove for 4-8 mins, then add coconut milk until only a few chunks are visible.

Is he a down to earth working man or a snake oil salesman ?
3225 2018-01-15 16:59:50 Because nationalizing all productive businesses and then destroying them isn't the hallmark of socialism?? Let me guess, you're blaming the debt they accumulated (and Castro paid off in exchange for oil) is independent of their government??
3226 2018-01-15 16:59:46 @EmmanuelMacron merci pour l'augmentation du gas oil. la plupart des gens roulent avec du gasoil, belle collecte d'impôts encore. jusqu'à quand tu vas nous appauvrir, remarque que lorsqu'on à rien, en France on a tout. vivement Marine
3227 2018-01-15 16:58:52 I work on an oil rig and it’s just the same as any other job. You go to work and go ‘home’ don’t you? There’s more to money than working offshore, the time off, the level at which you have to work at and it’s a lot more interesting than working 9-5 with four weeks holiday a year

3230 2018-01-15 16:58:31 More proof all the GOP care about is big money. We don’t need to drill for oil anymore. What we need are investments in solar and wind technology to protect what valuable resources we have left.
3231 2018-01-15 16:57:56 The GOP policy was pretty simple take Russian money for the RNC, tax cut sell off public lands to the oil and gas which they have stock in cash out that's why so many are retiring or quitting

3235 2018-01-15 16:57:21 About to act like I found some oil
3236 2018-01-15 16:56:59 Yes please 
3237 2018-01-15 16:56:57 John how do you know when to cut your loss? Not to add? If oil breaks 65 to upside? Trying to not make same mistake I did with $CHK.
3238 2018-01-15 16:56:08 It's only in Nigeria that thieves own oil blocks, awarded national honors, allocated resources and now lands & empowerment of herdsmen because @MBuhari rears cows. This deceit most end. Am in talks with some legal practitioners to take this up at international criminal court.
3239 2018-01-15 16:56:02 Ayy bro you should get a Lexus I drove my modifies 2011 IS350 like a damn nascar for 85k miles nothing but routine oil changes and maintenance lol
3240 2018-01-15 16:55:57 What does working on an oil rig have to do with Tevez?
3241 2018-01-15 16:55:53 This policy in itself doesn’t hurt middle class America if it is planned out for years and years. Outside factors hurt middle class families, they effect the IS-LM market in unpredictable ways.. for example subprime loans, an oil crises, war, etc.

3243 2018-01-15 16:55:23 PM NarendraModi will visit to Rajasthan tomorrow to inaugurate commencement of work of state's first-ever oil refinery at Pachpadra in Rajasthan's Barmer district and will address a public meeting there.

3246 2018-01-15 16:54:59 The problem isn’t oil supple, US frackers produce a ton of oil.   The problem is getting refined. Are they going to refine off coast?
3247 2018-01-15 16:54:47 Oh no!!  Not more oil!!  Damn it!!
3248 2018-01-15 16:54:38 @FLOTUS  Univ of CA, San Diego researchers in 2017 discovered when R arteries start clogging! It begins when we consume combinations of two foods together; the first contains poor grade oil/fat, such as in deep fried foods and the second is refined sugar, such as in Donuts!
3249 2018-01-15 16:54:19 4 new tires, alignment, high beam replacement, brakes, oil change, safety inspection, emissions inspection. BRUH F**K ME.

3251 2018-01-15 16:53:46 Why are ppl asking if I'm off of work like I don't work in oil and gas. Why would they care ab MLK 
3252 2018-01-15 16:53:42 @Take5_OilChange so annoyed by your location in #Dallas off Lemmon Ave. It took an hour to get my oil changed.
3253 2018-01-15 16:53:22 One of the main reasons I think that Global Warming is a Hoax is that Al Gore is pedaling the idea.  That man has been a snake oil salesman since day one and has been wrong on everything. (My apologies to all snakes.)
3254 2018-01-15 16:53:16 Most car companies: we've announced were producing an all electric line up by 2024 (at the latest)
#Trump : let's bring back U.S coastal oil drilling. Which we've been trying to get rid of for 30 years. 
-1st coal now oil is he the oldest dumbest businessman on the planet.

3258 2018-01-15 16:52:40 Honey, I’ve been everywhere. My car takes the highest price oil there is and it ain’t no 9.99
3259 2018-01-15 16:52:39 You literally couldn't make it up. Conveniently forgetting the fact that spending an Oil Crook's fortune is the only reason they are now relevant. But hey United spend their own revenue and it's a crime against Football??? Pathetic.

3267 2018-01-15 16:51:39  Keep it in protective styles, under wigs etc most of the time. Wash and do hot oil treatment in between hairstyles. Base your scalp with oils regularly even when you have a protective style
3268 2018-01-15 16:51:37 I HATE when bitches don’t know shit about cars but be tryna speak on em lmaoooo don’t worry about nobody’s foreign when your Camry ain’t had a oil change in 9,000 miles
3269 2018-01-15 16:51:30 I think it is fair to complain about the conduct of "a creep who stepped over the line." No means no. Stop means stop. I'm not comfortable with this. I'm not ready.  All mean something to me.
3270 2018-01-15 16:51:22 Just saw an amazing rosemary, lemon, garlic and olive oil marinade I wanna try for my chicken tonight. Wow it’s gonna be lit 
3271 2018-01-15 16:51:18 returning home from the surgeon with.....olive oil and toilet paper.............(actually it's a bottle of sanitizer & a roll of bandages, but......the visuals bear an uncanny resemblance )
3272 2018-01-15 16:51:13 It’s actually impossible to lose weight in an arab household. The amount of oil my mum uses is ridiculous 
3273 2018-01-15 16:50:52 For lazy nights, I take a Parent's Choice cucumber baby wipe, spray baby oil on it, wipe off eye and face make up (it usually requires one wipe for eyes and one for face) and then use one without baby oil to wipe the residue off.

3288 2018-01-15 16:48:51 The on/off ramps are super slippery even if there's a bit of moisture I don't speed at all and I have spun out on the king st off ramp more than once. Too much oil used it comes to the surface and makes it dangerous shame on the company that paved it.

3290 2018-01-15 16:48:41 Crews from #LondonRoad and #Arnold have attended a kitchen fire on Broxtowe Street, Nottingham. The fire was due to oil in a pan. 1 hose reel 2 breathing apparatus used to extinguish the fire, they then used a
positive pressure ventilation fan to remove smoke from the premise.
3291 2018-01-15 16:48:29 Selling essential oil is so weird
3292 2018-01-15 16:48:11 Hot oil! 
3293 2018-01-15 16:47:59 Is it me or it's cold tonight w o w

3294 2018-01-15 16:47:46 And if you wear make up, I swear by clinique's take the day off balm and baby oil (I use one or the other) and then I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. I love fresh's soy cleanser, kiehl's ultra facial cleanser, and neutrogena's fresh foaming cleanser.
3295 2018-01-15 16:47:22 Dumped about 5 gallons of oil on the floor today. I learned that pointing coolant lines towards the service door is bad.
3296 2018-01-15 16:47:21 They need to hurry up with this oil change

3304 2018-01-15 16:45:47 Combine 4 1/2 tbsps hot dogs with 2 cups hot dogs. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve over kale.
3305 2018-01-15 16:45:22 If anything he’s following through on promises made which is what those who voted for him wanted to begin with. Expanding coal and oil drilling, reducing corporate regulation. None of these things are comparable to “Stalin” or “Hitler”. Controlling immigration is not “racist”.

3308 2018-01-15 16:45:11 Btw: Pain is a warning, that something isn't running right. If in your car the low oil warning light goes red, you wouldn't stick a patch over it & go on if nothing happened. But concerning their body, also while exercising, people take painkillers & think it's o.k. #thinkaboutit

Fossil-fuel has about 30 years and it's all over. Electric vehicles are win-win for automakers. Oil co's. Better prepare.. it may happen sooner. The SecSt isn't in the pocket of big oil..he owns it.

3320 2018-01-15 16:44:21 you need to get a job on an oil rig
3321 2018-01-15 16:44:08 interesting but still; how will we be able to produce, at an affordable price, all the solar panels and windmills and other means of renewable energy without all the oil and non renewable resources we currently use in the process of building them?
3322 2018-01-15 16:44:05 I know, I know! But my face never felt dry and moisturizers turned me into an oil slick.

3326 2018-01-15 16:43:11 I wish they're not out of oil
3327 2018-01-15 16:43:03 And he should find a relative of Dominic Greene’s and leave them out there with a can of motor oil!

3330 2018-01-15 16:42:44 Bottle of olive oil cheaper than £8
3331 2018-01-15 16:42:37 I was pretty shocked too. I use to always think our wars were simply economic hegemony (control of others' oil, natural resources). I had know idea human organs are traded as mere spoils of our war. Nothing good can come of this.
3332 2018-01-15 16:41:55 I did some searching up on the googles the other night and it came up with that. Only olive oil in the house had garlic infused with it 
3333 2018-01-15 16:41:51 Bad baby oil change 
3334 2018-01-15 16:41:48 My Dermatologists says Coconut oil is good for your face- it is comedogenic so it clogs your pores and since it is so thick and is a sold at room temperature it doesn’t get absorbed it just sits on top of dry dean skin cells

3337 2018-01-15 16:41:45 This will change your life.
Get asparagus (the thinner the better), cut off the white tips (make sure the green tips are tight), and toss them in olive oil and salt. Roast them on about 400 for maybe 15 minutes, or until they look toasted.
3338 2018-01-15 16:41:35 Yep! They make it so you don't take advantage of the free oil changes. Lol
3339 2018-01-15 16:41:28 Ethiopia is not poor. It is coffee rich which is better than oil!
3340 2018-01-15 16:41:27 Keep his name out your mouth you dragon priest snake oil salesman
3341 2018-01-15 16:41:17 Idk why I decided to bring my car to the dealer for an oil change.. been here over an hour
3342 2018-01-15 16:41:05 You probably already have. Should we have blamed Obama for the Gulf oil spill or for trains derailing and trucks wrecking & spilling oil?
3343 2018-01-15 16:40:36 I use olive oil for my whole body +face and I seem to be glowing, with zero skin problems

3344 2018-01-15 16:40:29 Something that may help is roasting. I like to roast potato, broccoli, and carrot pieces in the oven on 450 F and put olive oil, salt, basil, rosemary, and oregano on them (before roasting). They don't taste strongly of veggies after that.

Industry talks of 47% capacity utilisation. When a company z prepackaging cooking oil. Cooking from Rsa z cheaper. The argument we buy forex. Nonsense

Government needs to go back to drawing board. Stop B.Sing!

3348 2018-01-15 16:40:07 The highest bidder? Like 45 sending jobs overseas and dropping Russian sanctions so his boyfriend, the oil mogul, can bring his pipes that were waiting on a barge off the coast for the moment the sanctions dropped? Why don't you go down and build a wall & bring your cats, crazy!
3349 2018-01-15 16:39:57 I remember the SNP declaring "Scotland more than pays its way in taxes" and promising a "£1bn a year oil fund" prior to the indyref. The £12-15bn deficit says otherwise.
What is it with Brexit/Scot nats that they have to lie so much to the people they are meant to be serving??

3353 2018-01-15 16:39:43 Ah okay. Got you now. Still, this is quite interesting, why are they burning through commercial inventory at this pace? Given the price of oil.
3354 2018-01-15 16:39:37 Use warm olive oil and get them blasted you bean
3355 2018-01-15 16:39:35 But you didn’t settle biggest question:Who gets Isabelle’s car for 6 weeks?And has she gotten oil change/tire rotation?

3360 2018-01-15 16:38:20 I just don’t know, how to manage middle class family’s budget. Modi Govt was given power with so many expectations. Oil price will reduce, will get jobs, he will change INDIA like America. Non happened, seems like

3363 2018-01-15 16:37:24 I am a robot. I piss oil
3364 2018-01-15 16:37:20 rUK would be desperate to trade with anyone it could.   Is it going to refuse to buy Scottish oil. electricity, water , beef.  etc.
3365 2018-01-15 16:37:16 that coconut oil & cocoa butter combo >
3366 2018-01-15 16:37:07 Honestly, I believe that most are safe in small amounts. If you come across an oil you are unsure about, we usually just Google it and see how much exposure is safe. But like I said, I've diffused all kinds of oils for years.

3371 2018-01-15 16:36:39 Yeah, they make the point that social costs will take 10+ years to reform away from oil effectively, so social costs will keep prices higher. I guess in this respect they are right, but it glosses over the fact that production cut deals are not a given.
3372 2018-01-15 16:36:28 Hey, we love the beardliness too! Lots of us keep warm, handsome beards (and soften them up with brushes, oil and conditioner). But if you want to save money and shave, safety or straight razors are THE way to go. Plus they're way more fun.
3373 2018-01-15 16:36:21 I’m rebelling against a system that keeps millions in poverty while enriching the wealthiest, that subsidizes the oil industry but makes healthcare unaffordable, that forces labor for profit at the expense of people and promotes a racist criminal justice system

3401 2018-01-15 16:29:54 The cleansing oil is so far beyond Purity the difference is amazing. I used the Renewed Hope cream cleanser and I really liked that but Crap Free cleansing oil is better than anything I've ever used.
3402 2018-01-15 16:29:33 This is the thing.  We shouldn’t be “poorer” at all. We have tremendous natural resources. And the fact we are worse off, despite having oil shows that Westminster have squandered and mismanaged them. Thanks ed you’ve further proven my point.

3410 2018-01-15 16:28:32 So the coast gaurd have to use ice breakers on the Hudson less you dont get that oil to heat ya crib but if you say so
3411 2018-01-15 16:28:32 "Deep Freeze Brings Ice Jams on the Hudson"
90% of Heating Oil used by the Northeast for heating in the winter moves by barge along the Hudson.....
3412 2018-01-15 16:28:28 Guessing are trying to use Venezuela as the example. Where there is insufficient money generated from oil to be able to invest to maintain or expand production. rather than at countries like saudi with big bank accounts that can allow survival in bad times. Makes sense.

3433 2018-01-15 16:24:44 Cars didn’t do that. Oil, gas, and tire companies did when they bought up public transportation trolly lines and ripped them up for... wait for it... cars. Goodbye competition
3434 2018-01-15 16:24:38 Almost 2 hours later my oil change ain’t done  what are they doing to my car

3439 2018-01-15 16:23:51 This morning I remembered that you lied your way into a job destroying the environment on behalf of oil and coal companies. Somehow that seems fitting too.
3440 2018-01-15 16:23:21 Venezuela's oil production has increased to near 1.9 million barrels per day after hitting a historic low for last year - Venezuelans are facing an economic crisis with millions of people suffering food & medicine shortages - Where's the oil money going?  MADURO??
3441 2018-01-15 16:23:04 I too suffered like your father when I had my oil changed at the Jeep dealership on 46. They hide the remote so you can't change Wendy Williams.
3442 2018-01-15 16:23:03 I use Jamaican castor oil doesn’t work really. I’ll try tea tree oil
3443 2018-01-15 16:22:47 Thanks! I'm not actually looking for products. My skin looks the best it has in years thanks to a steady regimen of constant dousing in rosehip oil. (Also, drinking lots of water and not smoking cigarettes.)
3444 2018-01-15 16:22:42 I should probably learn how to change my own oil

3449 2018-01-15 16:22:19 That's really shitty. An oil painting instructor (and accomplished painter in his own right) once told me that painting was just "fixing mistakes over and over again". I found it really encouraging to hear that from someone so skilled. 

I don't know what that person's deal is.
3450 2018-01-15 16:22:02 Jamaican black castor oil and tea tree oil will help it grow tremendously.
3451 2018-01-15 16:21:47 Yeh, oil companies worked with car companies to kill the electric car in the 1980s! We would all have free green energy and electric cars if it werent for the corrupting influence of big oil

3539 2018-01-15 16:11:39 @SenTomCotton angry he was fooled into thinking the Iraq war was about stopping terrorist. The oil industry is grateful. 
So, perhaps he's doing them a favor?

3553 2018-01-15 16:10:12 This is an ultra leverage game using energy and commodities as collateral.

For each $1 of oil, ng, copper, iron ore etc, $5-20 are gambled in shadow banking. it is a shadow banking game

3562 2018-01-15 16:08:56 Lmaooo, he can’t afford the cost of oil or maintenance for that shit if he’s paying $400+ a month for it 
3563 2018-01-15 16:08:50 Let’s see what happens to all that “free” stuff after the oil runs out (or after the “leave it in the ground” crowd gets its way).
3564 2018-01-15 16:08:38 Anybody in hall 3 or 4 have coconut or olive oil ?! #ASUTwitter #AlbanyState
3565 2018-01-15 16:08:37 First it was NEDC now it is ministry of livestock development?..This is a joke!...A "shithole" joke of the century!!...They should explore all meaningful avenue to establish ranches and start real business...When did cows amount to crude oil?...Hahahaha
3566 2018-01-15 16:08:37 $70 - This is the price of crude oil (Brent) as it stands right now!

3567 2018-01-15 16:08:27 . Not all tournament boats has been run hard. There are some that has not been. Most of the hours on my boat are under 3800 RPM. 
There is a reason for that less fuel consumption.  I fish alot and I mean alot. And I don't own a oil well lol.
3568 2018-01-15 16:08:24 And a cooking oil too.
3569 2018-01-15 16:08:14 i use dial antibacterial bar soap on my face, it was the only thing that helped my skin back before i did accutane, now i still use it with the clinique face wash after, then moisturizer. when i used to have acne it helped cut the huge amounts of oil my face was making
3570 2018-01-15 16:08:12 How does it not follow the strand of logic? Rome was pagan to begin with and the cult took over branding everything else pagan and worthy of denigration! What do you expect?? It is not mandatory, that everyone believe JEEBUS the snake oil salesman!
3571 2018-01-15 16:08:10 Now… don’t head to the store and pay no 6 or 7 bucks for the oil, they'll rip you off… walk in ya girl’s bathroom, look under the sink.. you’ll find it about 3 rows back. Take the whole bottle, she got like 4 of them joints in there. Bless up.
3572 2018-01-15 16:07:46 Cari aja shopnya di shopee puriverabotanicals, btw itu sbnrnya face oil sih tp di keterangan bs jg buat panjangin bulu mata dan emg works bgt di aku.
3573 2018-01-15 16:07:45 JB is problematic for many reasons. Zero experience, oil pipeline investments, questionable wiretapped FBI conventions with disgraced former gov Blagovich, and he hasn’t released his full tax returns.

3578 2018-01-15 16:07:04 Its crazy that I can take my @Acura in for an oil change & take 40 minutes but my @Jeep takes 3x longer....amazing the difference in attention to customer service management at a dealership makes
3579 2018-01-15 16:06:44 @covertford second time in a week leaving without an oil change. They say an appointment for service is not when the work is done but just when you can drop your car off? That is not what an appointment is. Never buying a car there again.
3580 2018-01-15 16:06:14 I have a massive bottle of castor oil, I might just try to find some DIY detangling sprays and go with that.

3604 2018-01-15 16:03:51 I never use flour or oil to bake ,Dry rub only. Oil smokes the entire house up. When I do a roast I turn oven to 475F cook 3 lb roast 21 min ,turn down to 250 cook 2.5 more hours to seal in juice perfectly. No frying pan browning needed.

3649 2018-01-15 15:58:11 @CaptAbhimanyu @rssurjewala Diesel in haryana is costlier than Punjab , Himachal , chandigarh and delhi and now equal to Uttar pardesh . Thanks to state specific cost levied by oil marketing companies on 31 dec 2017 . Once cheapest state is not costliest .
3650 2018-01-15 15:58:11 I don't know, I'm just pouring some oil into the fire and starting a new rumor.

3652 2018-01-15 15:58:02 He is suing oil and gas companies for the same reason states sued tobacco companies. They knew carbon release could cause significant climate change, and lied to the public about it.

3654 2018-01-15 15:57:55  Totally agree!! NO ONE in California wants oil spills that wil definitely happen. How ‘bout building a platform 3 mi offshore from Mar-a-Lago? 
3655 2018-01-15 15:57:30 Need to end monopoly of state oil PSUs and require a proactive policy for independent retailers of oil products

3657 2018-01-15 15:57:09 And while you are at it, you lazy dirt, besides growing potatoes for Tators, grow some vegetable oil to fry our chips.
Oh, wait. Never mind.

3661 2018-01-15 15:56:42 The people of Bakassi whose lands Nigeria explored oil until OBJ dashed it to his friend Paul Biya; are yet to be properly relocated and reintegrated but Buhari Admin have concluded plans to create "Cattle Colony" for terrorist Miyetti Allah.

3663 2018-01-15 15:56:27 In Saudi Arabia a 35 year ban on cinemas has been lifted and the 1st film released is The Emoji Movie...

3673 2018-01-15 15:54:55 There was no violation. She voluntarily removed her clothes and then chose on multiple occasions to not leave his apartment. Aziz may have been a creep who stepped over the line, but it wasn't assault.
3674 2018-01-15 15:54:54 yes, but not american fans who wouldn’t have heard about city if arab oil money wasn’t around
3675 2018-01-15 15:54:49 That's not an argument.
They're A) facing an uphill battle to prove their allegations and B) to tie it directly and entirely to oil companies.
3676 2018-01-15 15:54:36 Yes, Mark, you got it. “Oiling out” means rubbing a little linseed oil or clear painting medium over a dry surface

3678 2018-01-15 15:54:14 Not only that , they went with a begging bowl to all the gulf nations asking for crude oil instead of improving the economy

3689 2018-01-15 15:52:39 You say ya legs hurt you need a massage, i got some oil i can rub on ya thighs...
3690 2018-01-15 15:52:35 Why was Venezuela discounting it's oil to Haiti when it needed the revenue? Why aren't island nations who gifted so much Sunshine not using solar? Why wud a man fixing to open a new restaurant allegedly commit suicide when he had so much to hope & live for? Thir logic escapes me.

3694 2018-01-15 15:52:13 Chicken oil used to have a sweet half price burger deal on mondays. Taz Indian Cuisine is my favorite place to eat in B/CS and has a lunch buffet but it’s pretty pricey.

3696 2018-01-15 15:51:49 Lol, it’s always the Jews fault ha.  Until Muslims figure out a way to live in a non dictatorship Islam majority country they will always be in the shithole list. (Having oil and gas only riches the powerful and not the poor, and only time until no one will use oil anymore)
3697 2018-01-15 15:51:45 The aquatic life of SS region is poisoned due to oil exploration since 1956.

Nigeria that depends on $bns from oil sales neither cleaned-up nor created "human colonies"

But "Cattle Colony" is novel/expedient

Buhari & his co-travellers are insulting sensibilities of generations

3702 2018-01-15 15:51:00 My first ever job interview was with Shell (UK). I was wrapping my Energy Masters and wanted to work-travel at the same time. I had Peru-Chile-Brazil in sight. I nailed it but Shell faked their oil reserves and all new appointments were canceled. Glad I had Eskom to fall back on.

3711 2018-01-15 15:49:36 Environmental: A tanker carrying almost 150,000 tons of oil caught on fire and sank yesterday. It crashed with a cargo ship over a week ago and was floating in the East China Sea. It is believed all 32 crew members died. Chinese officials have played down oil spill dangers.
3712 2018-01-15 15:49:11 Story time: My aunt came to visit me from Bangkok when I was 16 or so. Her sun avoidance game was  all the time. Other skincare/makeup, too. We're talking those cool Shiseido oil blotter wipes in the mid-90s (before they were cool) & a Badtz Maru sunbrella @ all times outside.

3716 2018-01-15 15:48:57 Depends if you need synthetic oil or regular. If your cars newer it probably needs synthetic!
3717 2018-01-15 15:48:50 Keep in mind though french fries are cooked in same oil as chicken and fish. MacDonalds was also uses beef flavor and milk products in their fries and hash browns.
3718 2018-01-15 15:48:48 USDINR still worried about Oil hence underperforming but Bonds were slightly up. One is right
3719 2018-01-15 15:48:17 So wrong.  Every country on earth except the US has pledged to transition from fossil fuels to renewables.  It will bring down the value of oil and gas companies just like what happened to coal.  This is a wise move.
3720 2018-01-15 15:48:15 Have you asked your lawyers just how they can prove the oil companies have caused a change in climate the resulted in Sandy, when not one scientist has ever proven AGW? It's all an opinion, and the courts will not listen to even expert opinions, unless the proof is provided.
3721 2018-01-15 15:48:13 I’ve been make up less for the past three weeks.. my pores need a break.  facials and coconut oil

3723 2018-01-15 15:47:44 Getting caught in the “oil” dumb dance
3724 2018-01-15 15:47:40 Libya, under Gadhafi, resisted Rothschild central bank  Libya had its own GOLD-BACKED currency  Libya used as staging ground for gun running by none other than Hillary ROTTEN Clinton All for control of Syrian oil/natural gas lines & ports  CIA = ISIS, among others 
3725 2018-01-15 15:47:36 You no like crude oil mixed with carrots?
3726 2018-01-15 15:47:31 No it wont but the long term decisions that affect the health of the industry are being provided by people that dont know a condensate from a heavy oil. They see oil as homogenous and that lack of knowledge could mean the difference of oil growth ending in 2025 or in 2050 etc.
3727 2018-01-15 15:47:12 รู้ตัวเองนะว่าเป็นคนขี้บ่นมาก
3728 2018-01-15 15:47:05 Yah while you voted for Tax Bill that increases the burden on the most margenilized and opened the Artic Refuge to $$$$ Big Money Big OIL. Yah...so proud. #Not
3729 2018-01-15 15:47:00 Just depends ...like to cook fish curry Bengali's use mustard oil at times mixed with other oils, mostly vegetable, as mustard oil has a very strong taste and smell. In fact a pinch of sugar is used to get rid of the strong taste of mustard oil and compliment it. So you see :-)
3730 2018-01-15 15:46:47 Norway would be the same way if it didn’t have the oil going through there county
3731 2018-01-15 15:46:43 I'm excited to see what happens to these fly-by-night Facebook gurus. You know, the ones that advertise the "get rich quick" FB ads schemes. Maybe this will be good for people who really get advertising & don't follow dumbass formula nonsense. Get rid of the snake oil. Maybe?

3735 2018-01-15 15:46:02 $70 a barrel. Extraction costs down to $12 a barrel. In some American states i.e North Dakota they are having to pay to have the fracked oil taken away for processing.

3742 2018-01-15 15:44:42 People stop taking your cars to Walmart because there oil changes are cheap! The employees there are 95% of the time not mechanically inclined and they will fuck your vehicle up some how some way! Trust me
3743 2018-01-15 15:44:33 I read Gorillla Mindthet cover to cover. Downloaded it for free. Can you clarify if I am supposed to maintain emotional control while greasing my hog with coconut oil?

3751 2018-01-15 15:43:03 The places I've seen close recently were pretentious, over-priced places that thrived on the $100-a-barrel oil patrons. Not the norm anymore I'm afraid. #AdaptOrDie
3752 2018-01-15 15:43:02 I really want some fresh focaccia with a high quality extra virgin olive oil and some beautifully aged balsamic
3753 2018-01-15 15:43:00 I worked a couple jobs during that time plus raising a family. So, I am not going to pretend to know everything. The tensions dated back farther. Airplanes blown up...Scotland...ME connections. Some other vague memories of hostages taken during Olympics. US need for oil.
3754 2018-01-15 15:42:56 Equities closed higher at the first trading session of the week as Brent crude oil price rose to $70 per barrel supported by ongoing output cuts led by OPEC and Russia. As a result, the benchmark index notched 51bps to close at 43,119.00 points

3758 2018-01-15 15:42:25 You should remain committed to protecting the planet (as opposed to drilling for oil).  Peace and love are great, but with no habitable planet left it won't much matter.
3759 2018-01-15 15:42:20 I put coconut oil on it 2 times a day and it really helps, also castor oil helps 
3760 2018-01-15 15:42:05 I get the feeling that these people finding "Alien artifacts" on Mars are the same sort of people that find Jesus in burnt toast and oil spills

3771 2018-01-15 15:41:04 It may have been that (bc lots of places sell pretty shit quality shea) or that your face just doesn't like it, which can happen with anything. But I make skin care products and whipped shea (so it has some aeration) made with a good skin oil is great for moisturizing faces!
3772 2018-01-15 15:40:49 It's one thing to check your oil and water every other day, which is trivial but would be cool to learn how every aspect of the vehicle works independently to keep it functional

3796 2018-01-15 15:38:21 Especially if you're a big oil company wanting to drill in a wildlife refuge! How much are you getting out of that deal?
3797 2018-01-15 15:38:18 Maybe all that tanning oil seeped into her skin too much... it really isn’t that hard to understand 
3798 2018-01-15 15:38:18 Biotin supplements are good and the occasional coconut oil mask could work wonders! Also I think @MikhilaMcDaid had a similar problem a while ago and recommended a bunch of different products that worked for her.

3804 2018-01-15 15:37:39 This is also true. But long term (though maybe after as Keynes pointed out we're all dead), Yamani's soundbite will be proved true: The stone age didn't end for lack of stone, nor the coal age for lack of coal. The oil age won't end for lack of oil.
3805 2018-01-15 15:37:35 ไม่บอก
3806 2018-01-15 15:37:34 For example, if the market does assume peak demand then refineries wont invest in the refinery. So if peak demand is a myth and product demand contuinues to grow then we maybe short of products. and even if it has the capacity it ight be the wrong oil to acheive the growth
3807 2018-01-15 15:37:29 Shea Moisture makes a sesame-almond skin oil that's even better than baby oil.
3808 2018-01-15 15:37:10 @LeoDiCaprio You probably won't see this but the government in Norway has decided not to drill for oil in the areas outside Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja for atlas 4 more years :)
3809 2018-01-15 15:37:07 Great work Boss. Oil dey ur head.
3810 2018-01-15 15:37:03 Yeah cause military budget is so small it can’t handle reductions? Maybe stop starting wars around the world to create a market for the industry around oil and military.

3815 2018-01-15 15:36:45 There's probably something there, but I think it's much more that they can keep claiming to be cooperating while doing very little and forcing KSA to bear larger burden. They need to move more oil to keep market share but the dividend freeze reduces political costs of compliance
3816 2018-01-15 15:36:44 Preheat oven to 350F. take 4 cutlets dip in egg/milk mixture flour brown in pan with oil 5 min on each side or until brown. Sauce is 32OZ chicken broth to 8OZ vinegar, You may use 4 OZ vinegar your first time. Put sauce in oven pan and cook the cutlets in oven 1.5 Hrs.

3826 2018-01-15 15:35:22 That's why oil's its own worst enemy. Every time the price spikes, that provokes a wave of capex aimed at reducing - at all levels - economic exposure to the stuff. The "more expensive/worse" tech tends to end up as roadkill, but contributes to the reduction. Other stuff works.

3831 2018-01-15 15:34:47 The problem is that changes cannot be made quickly in oil, therefore any incorrect macro assumption now could have significant effect on the oil market for the future. The effect of short/medium term disruptions could be multiplied by semantics in the long term macro assumptions

3902 2018-01-15 15:26:56 I think the macro assumption is "markets, technology & capital will sort it out". Which medium/long term is probably reasonable, but allows for lotsa disruption short/medium term. Cf. 1973, 1979/80, 1986, 2005, 2010-Present. As a wise person said, "what'll kill oil is oil".

3930 2018-01-15 15:23:39 People might bitch and complain about how #trump has said a "shithole country" or how #trudeau has said that Oil suck. If you are that pissed off about something why not do a grassroots movement?
3931 2018-01-15 15:23:39 I agree!!
And I know about it!!
But right now they have oil and natural gas resources so we can't go against them!!

Sometimes it's makes anger but what we can do!??

3971 2018-01-15 15:19:44 I love roasted carrots w/ a little olive oil and salt and pepper. It's simple and delicious. I like a lot of root veggies.
Never had turnips though.

3979 2018-01-15 15:19:11 Tumeric mask. Grate & mix it in coconut oil, put the paste on your face & wash it off after about 10-15 minuets. You have to wash w yogurt first to remove the stain tho but it improves your skin overall besides healing problem areas.

4003 2018-01-15 15:14:19 Real Americans don’t allow a divisive autocrat to shit all over their country and gaslight them into believing they didn’t already live in the greatest country on earth. Real Americans didn’t vote in an unfit, incompetent snake oil salesman who acts only in self interest.
4004 2018-01-15 15:14:07 First and foremost, it will redefine what it means to be a brand: "Alexa, I need toothpaste." "Hey Google, I need some more soap." "Hey Meta-name, "I need olive oil." In voice world, Kleenex - good, brand x facial tissue - not so much.

Whereas 1 Litre Petrol costs ₹75.

It's unanimously NaMo's effect.

4056 2018-01-15 15:07:59 For future reference our oil is dwindling. We are primarily a gas exporting nation now and have been for a few years. Fish exports while relatively small is picking up speed and the ambitions for this sector are imho well optimistic but they are there.

4067 2018-01-15 15:07:21 I'd be more concerned personally about the benefits to the UK of Scotland remaining, other than oil revenues, which will run out in the not too distant future, can't think of any offhand. So maybe it's best for all if you run another referendum. I'm all for autonomy.
4068 2018-01-15 15:07:20 Debt levels are astonishing. I am however, curious what the UCP folks will do to manage and decrease this debt. Cutting the Carbon Tax when it is greenwashing big oil is not a solution. #Ableg #Abpoli #cdnpoli

4070 2018-01-15 15:06:59 An Oil tanker should look like an oil tanker, a cargo hauler should resemble cargo,  thus a Garbage Truck should look like GARBAGE!!! . This is Kenya
4071 2018-01-15 15:06:57 You are a corrupt oil company insider who should not even be allowed to quote Dr King. Resign now
4072 2018-01-15 15:06:47 Hmmm, when one person use OIL and the other didn't use.
4073 2018-01-15 15:06:45 In $ language It gave the US economical advantages

4090 2018-01-15 15:04:55 Does anybody else think that drilling for oil off the coast of Florida would interfere with MR. Trumps Hotels and the Russian babies born here? No golf if we have an oil spill . No hotels for Russian mommies to stay in.
4091 2018-01-15 15:04:54 そうかな？そう見えないよ
4092 2018-01-15 15:04:45 If offshore drilling is deregulated as you have now done, then why did you exclude Florida’s coast? Oh, right, you have properties in FL that would be affected by an oil spill. #trumpcrimefamily

4097 2018-01-15 15:03:42 Fine, then let it burn.  We don't want a huge amount of oil to blast out.  It would cripple that immediate environment.  This is the only way I can think of as far as temporarily containing it.

4100 2018-01-15 15:03:23 Thats because oil and gas companies are causing global climate change. The end is near as electric cars are ramping up big time. The rich oil elite is about to end won't miss those slimemold one bit

4117 2018-01-15 15:01:49 Virginia Beach and Sandbridge Beach have put a great deal of effort and money into reclaiming their beautiful beaches over the years-- sand erosion, and oil spills from the nearby Naval Station gunking up the beaches in the old days-- why would they jeopardize that?

4126 2018-01-15 15:00:25 Yes, I would call it 'oversupply' due to falling oil (and coal) demand - due to climate policy measures and such expectations. Natgas demand will start similar decline some years later.

4152 2018-01-15 14:56:56 By all means, dear leader, let's continue promoting the use of oil and coal! I mean, just imagine the devastation if two ships full of sun or wind collided.
4153 2018-01-15 14:56:30 No doubt theyll want the detail of how much a Kraft cheese slice will cost in an Indy Scotland; before excitedly bleating about black holes and how oil extraction costs the UK government billions a year in subsidies.

Spain will block EU access and NATO will nuke us. Yadda yadda

4168 2018-01-15 14:54:54 I'm enjoying the specificity of the wrongness here: "When the engine of your vehicle will not start the problem could be the thickening of the motor oil. If the motor oil isn't viscous enough to  flow through the engine, the motor doesn’t have any medium to get powered up."

You probably have to feed it lube through a hole about 5 mins before action. 

Remember oil, not water based lube. Only use water based if you're using condoms.

4312 2018-01-15 14:32:34 The government should help owners change all the fuel oil customers in the Eastern part of the US. It’s insane that we still have fuel oil heat. Should be natural gas. This is one more thing that makes us energy dependent on other countries.

4333 2018-01-15 14:29:53 Clearly, the solution is a country-wide strategy that requires Canadian oil to go to Canadian markets first, instead of allowing market forces to decide. 

We could call it a National Energy Program.

4335 2018-01-15 14:29:34 Yes,there is palm oil in our Creamy Oat Fraiche. We can not use rapeseed oil since the oil is not hard and saturated enough. We strongly oppose the deforestation and exploitation that occur in the production of palm oil and use certified, traceable palm oil.>
4336 2018-01-15 14:29:32 You need to try #CBD oil!
4337 2018-01-15 14:29:15 Turning around an oil tanker takes some time, was never going to be a quick fix given the complete mess he took over.  Villa were teetering on the brink at one stage dont forget
4338 2018-01-15 14:29:09 Try using sea salt when you cook also they have like olive oil butter and stuff like that it’s a lot better for you coconut oil isn’t as great for you sometimes i know everyone says it holy grail but try to rotate often

1. Inflation expectation will keep rising (oil price awareness was the last catalyst, if commos keep going higher, esp if Soft commos move up too inf expectations will go north too).

4512 2018-01-15 14:07:58 Yeah, they really need to stop finding all these new oil fields. Really need to shut it all down, it’s just such a burden. What is the price of crude oil these days?
4513 2018-01-15 14:07:31 I KNEW that was coming. If someone spilled oil in Alaska or milk in the White House kitchen, Obama did it. Nuts. They are coming out of the walls like cockroaches. Time to call in an exterminator. 2018.

4609 2018-01-15 13:54:25 I had a “massage” at Massage Envy yesterday.  It was 90 minutes of a woman smearing oil on some of my body.  It sucked!  I doubt the woman was a licensed masseuse.  She didn’t know what she was doing.  Worst “massage” EVER.  It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life.
4610 2018-01-15 13:54:18 I kind of follow a bastardized Korean skincare routine - an 'essence', a serum, some kind of chemical exfoliator, a moisturizer and an oil.

4612 2018-01-15 13:54:09 Did you know that taking fish oil supplements can help improve reading and writing in children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties?
4613 2018-01-15 13:53:59 Though, I'd agree with you that it is only 'perceived abundance' since it is based on the assumption that #oil production would not decrease faster (e.g. due to high depletion rates) than #oil demand.
4614 2018-01-15 13:53:56 Thank you Victoria. It’s great your meds are working. I’m doing ok. Started taking CBD oil and it’s helping. Hope you have an amazing week ahead.

4616 2018-01-15 13:53:42 The price of oil is $70 today and more than the projected revenue from oil in 2018. When will ordinary Nigerians feel the effect?

4619 2018-01-15 13:53:25 It also based Scotland being better off , based on  $100 barrels of oil - hardly a textbook exercise in Risk Analysis, was it ...
4620 2018-01-15 13:53:22 Westminster has removed the Scots Mint; abolished the burghs; interfered with Scottish education at all levels; enforced English rules on immigration, taxation, going to war, stolen 6,000 square miles of Scottish waters plus oil wells, and all the fishing to English jurisdiction
4621 2018-01-15 13:53:04 My point is why are people complaining about this shithole thing, if it is not true why will immigration sell forms to 8000+ unemployed just to employ 500. What happened to the oil money?. It's time Africans prove to the world that we are not shitholes by managing our resources.

Scotland needs to act now , to use that short time frame , to create NFP eco power companies - or Westminster will spend it instead

4888 2018-01-15 13:09:32 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

4891 2018-01-15 13:09:14 Point is that most industries(save Facebook,&Google)battle in global marketplaces, often owned by multi-nationals.
Which means all arguments about *magic bullet*products (only Scotland has) that will effortlessly ease Inde pains..whether oil, whisky, gin,energy; are always flawed

4906 2018-01-15 13:06:56 We have done a recipe improvement on our base pastry, which has included the addition of coconut oil. We have chosen this over palm oil due to the sustainability issues associated with palm oil whilst ensuring the oil complements our pastry.
4907 2018-01-15 13:06:47 Just leave it to fry before turning. Putting koun .. big solid koun in the oil helps prevent/reduce sticking to the pan

4912 2018-01-15 13:06:17 Is this a parody account? Let's just assume it is all about the oil. If so, isn't it great news that oil prices are rising sharply. They've now passed USD70 a barrel and continue to climb. Or did you just miss that?
4913 2018-01-15 13:06:15 But the oil is running dry...
4914 2018-01-15 13:06:15 It did lead to buying opportunities for investors who saw that oil prices and share prices had dropped too low.
4915 2018-01-15 13:06:09 If only we'd gone for it back before the oil was dicovered, look what we would have won...
4916 2018-01-15 13:05:56 So...how is it that the Kurds have the autonomy to "refine, process and sell their own oil" but, alas, "no money to pay for their own weapons and training?" That doesn't even make logical sense.

5012 2018-01-15 12:51:15 I know adding oil sounds strange BUT your scalp is producing extra oil to 1) replace oil that is being striped out or 2) to get something off of it. Oil is the skin/hair lubrication. It’s only going to produce it for one of those two reasons or both.

Like all socialist states it will falter when the money source runs dry.  That day is coming for its every more costly #oil production
5018 2018-01-15 12:49:59 Don’t the middle classes drink olive oil as if it’s a delicacy anyway?

5021 2018-01-15 12:49:33 I am reminded that when Dr.Seuss wrote the Lorax the lumber industry scrambled to debunk the childrens book. The point is from tobacco to NRA to oil industry they have been completely duplicitous for their own self interest. They are vulture capitalists and he is another shill.

5028 2018-01-15 12:49:20 Former hair dresser of 13 years here: wash it twice. You most likely have product build up (if you use dry shampoo this builds up as well even though it’s “shampoo”) use a leave in conditioner rather than a heavy wash out conditioner and add a tiny bit of oil to your ends

The terrible, tragic incident of fire in our country's oil tanker off the eastern coast of China, which resulted in the death of its entire crew, caused great grief and sorrow for the people of Iran.

with regard to CPC. they buy cheapest crude available and from those willing to give it open credit. Its tender process has had many weird results over the yrs. So margin not always priority

5218 2018-01-15 12:16:22 Refineries should be repaired instead of outrageous money used to refine crude oil abroad. I also learnt Nigeria doesnt have a national currency printing machine which is bad. Opening all borders for importation of goods and exporting our goods too.

5225 2018-01-15 12:15:52 The oil price has just shown up their massive government incompetence and lack of diversity. Not helped by all the new hand outs. As for the lack of rain for power that is proven to be a simple case of pumping too much water to generate power rather than any lack of rain.

5249 2018-01-15 12:12:18 $oil price at 64 is definitely at the higher end of this bullish run into the option expiration date.
soon or later it will have to come back to 60 or lower again on whatever excuse it maybe.

5273 2018-01-15 12:09:14 As above, ur first point falls flat on its face so u find a new poorly informed assertion. UK subsidises oil industry makes no money out of it, oil price rising, yes it will, Scotland has massive Green energy resources, Scotland self-sufficient & subsidises rUK energy market.
5274 2018-01-15 12:08:56 What about human rights in Saudi Arabia? They're executing people by the hundreds per year. Where is your outcry? Were you silenced with oil money?
5275 2018-01-15 12:08:51 First of all, your skin is even everywhere. You can use coconut oil from top to bottom and you’ll be fine so 
5276 2018-01-15 12:08:38 Hey California, Why Are You Allowing the Use of Oil Wastewater To Irrigate Our Food?
5277 2018-01-15 12:08:04 it's very possible just the way gas and Oil are being transported from South 2the North.
5278 2018-01-15 12:08:01 I was visualizing what our coastal waters will soon look like all along the East and West Coast with oil rigs and sludge and dead sea life and birds  littering its shores.

5281 2018-01-15 12:06:28 While there is a lot of debate about what renewables need to achieve to completely supply human power needs, there should be similar debates about what thermal (coal, oil, gas) needs to provide equivalent pollution-free energy. Put both technologies on the same pedestal.

5296 2018-01-15 12:03:56 Saudi Arabia; controlled by super rich oil barons, super rich stick together, allows more control and cruelty over the masses, without their armies and weapons, supplied in part by UK;  THEY ARE NOTHING, more of us than them??

5300 2018-01-15 12:03:19 I love the way folk like u just ignore substantive points that negate what uv just said&move onto the next unconnected ill informed assertion.
1. No it isn't, UK is the only state that subsidises the oil companies,go figure.
2. Yes it will eventually but oil price currently >

5329 2018-01-15 11:57:28 We are socialist and have a blend economy, that means that we are capitalist, except with oil and some few other things, and that is actually really great for us.
5330 2018-01-15 11:57:09 I just use face cleaning wipes to remove oil off my face. Other stuff makes my break outs worse
5331 2018-01-15 11:56:56 With the kind of profits tullow oil announced,,launching two DONATED ambulances is just pathetic....How many insults should we endure before we realise how much we are blessed with untapped wealth. WAKE UP!

5347 2018-01-15 11:53:16 He was given 390 million to pay off a stadium in 12 years. Almost the same amount pep has spent at city. Arsenal doesnt have oil money. He used the little that he had to make something.
5348 2018-01-15 11:53:11 No escaping the oil price hike. The gas station I regularly frequent has increased gas rates to P4/L since Jan. 9 
5349 2018-01-15 11:53:04 We've got a nice break in oil #CL_F from resistance levels at 61.5-ish. Might get a run to 70$ if geopolitical factors like OPEC and shale producers don't increase production. (At 70$ the avg. shale producer is making ~50% profit) #oott

5352 2018-01-15 11:52:26 In early 90s and 2Ks SHAMPOO brands bullied us of having OILY hair and recommended their products for removal of excess oil.... 2018 the same brands are recommending products with milk proteins and OIL extracts to cure DRY hair ... 
5353 2018-01-15 11:52:22 Oh I’d have cooked alive today if I’d have used oil  put loads of cream on and still managed to go red 
5354 2018-01-15 11:52:12 Eigenlijk wel. De anti-globalwarming-lobby kent stevige gelijkenis met de sigarettenlobby. Verschil is dat Big Oil & co veel grotere belangen en budgetten heeft.

5374 2018-01-15 11:46:05 Economies are weird entities. E.g. the pound is a petro-currency because of North Sea Oil. It is also a finance currency cos of City- which makes it overvalued, which impacts on our manufacturing sector. So if we lose some of our finance it will cool London & help North.
5375 2018-01-15 11:45:55 Wow, anyone who wants to increase their followers just tweet something with the word “oil” in it. The new followers come flooding in. All useless of course but helpful from a vanity perspective.

5381 2018-01-15 11:44:37 There is nothing like the abducted chibok girls, if they abducted any, they must have on hunger. Any story about the chibok girls, the northerners are using it the play politics to syphone the oil money for their devilish interest.
5382 2018-01-15 11:44:28 Zach: So what kind of drinks did the Saudis buy you 
Me: Crude oil.
5383 2018-01-15 11:44:08 Let the oil burn up. You kill the fire now and besides air pollution, there will be heavy marine damage.-
5384 2018-01-15 11:43:17 Oh also almond oil
5385 2018-01-15 11:43:11 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
5386 2018-01-15 11:42:35 Never 'ad no trouble with oil powered podcasts.
5387 2018-01-15 11:42:17 And it's not a considerable amount of money either which is what gets me....228 mil. In 10 years for the oil industry is literally equivalent to saving pennies every year. People's lives mean more than that.

5391 2018-01-15 11:41:21 oily skin still needs moisturising-an overproduction of sebum is often linked to dehydration (the skin is thirsty but cannot produce water so just produces more oil to compensate). so a good moisturiser will regulate the oily-/dryness of whole face :)
5392 2018-01-15 11:41:18 How does the EU give us cheaper access to raw materials? I thought the opposite was true?
Indeed discovery of North Sea oil, it can be argued, was one of the reasons the French softened their position in letting us join in the first place. EU food, steel, energy etc is expensive.

5395 2018-01-15 11:40:39 Yes cuz billions of pounds spent by City really doesn't outweigh United giving alexis 400k. What a dumb f**king tweet. World will be oil free earlier than city catching United. 
5396 2018-01-15 11:40:38 Not for me! I need carbs to stay awake! I think there’s probably less fat for me, but vegan doesn’t mean healthier in terms of weight loss necessarily (but you’re reducing potential cow hormones/ Animal fats which are bad ect.)... but also vegetable oil is calorific 
5397 2018-01-15 11:40:26 Here we go again on the political blame game. Compared to the thousands of jobs lost in oil in Aberdeen this will be a breeze.
5398 2018-01-15 11:40:22 The TRAITORS are leaving because they filled their pockets from selling country to Corporations and Rich LOBBYIST representatives. SOLD Resources to FOREIGN OWNED CORPORATIONS. Mobile oil, Shell, Chevron all boards foreign controlled by Rich.

5400 2018-01-15 11:40:14 Get your point Baz, but he just doesn’t seem to fit the profile of a modern CB, apart from size. He turns like an oil tanker, instinctively back tracks all the time, looks insanely nervous and hesitant. Complete opposite to Holgate, who is becoming the boss man.

5414 2018-01-15 11:36:26 I imagine so. Oats (cheaper if not GF), sugar, water, cheap vegetable oil / salt, perhaps ... Depends on ingredients, but very possibly.

5417 2018-01-15 11:35:39 You mean, like catastrophic coverage policies, and routine, predictable things like check-ups and preventative services cost fair cash prices, much like gas and oil changes, which you'd *never* demand your car insurance be responsible for?

You so crazy!

5574 2018-01-15 11:01:54 It is rather unfortunate that they fooled is and got into power unfortunately they increased the price of petrol telling us that deregulation that was discredited in 2012 was now the solution. Now again they have started deregulation of the already presumably deregulated oil

5707 2018-01-15 10:28:07 These oil companies are fooling no one. They make separate fuel price announcements pero it's all the same, a carbon copy of the others. Why don't they just make one single announcement tutal onvious naman na cartel sila!

The face & eye cream in the #Christmas set is still going as you need very little. I’ve been using it 1 week
5721 2018-01-15 10:26:50 one of the fountainheads of the Med as we know it actually. I live in Italy, and whenever I hear blabbing about "autoctonous oil/ wine / hazelnut / cherry", I do have to suppress a laugh. all of those come from Greece / Asia minor, and most of those were diffused by Phoenicians.
5722 2018-01-15 10:26:45 I used Dawn soap to wash my hands so that I could make a steak, today. You know, the same soap that they use to save animals from oil and dirt? I feel like a terrible person.

5736 2018-01-15 10:23:48 I have suffered since I was about 4 years old with depression.  I am an extroverted sensitive so feel every second of every emotion.  Doing yoga has helped me manage it, along with cbd oil.

5762 2018-01-15 10:19:15 Who’s your economics / finance journalist ? Please define austerity. Government wages are at a record 15.5% of GDP. Fuel is subsidized, pasta, bread, couscous, sugar, cooking oil, bottled gas, still highly subsidized.
5763 2018-01-15 10:19:04 Fossil fuels aren't going away, but increasingly investers are putting more of their capital into green energy.  Oil & gas have heavier startup costs, longer term returns, unstable market certainty, public opposition, political hurdles, & moral contempt.

Nothing the agent would say could change that and a higher salary wouldn't either.  My annoyance is with that and also the portrayal that City, the club built on oil money 1/2

5934 2018-01-15 09:42:36 its  a new trend today ( oil last few months for instance recently :) ), after 1.30 we will plunge   < 1.20 ( or 1.20 at least). But lets see,  looks like capitulation - no eur/usd bears at all in town :)
5935 2018-01-15 09:42:22 Norwegians are not complaining about it. Also your numbers are wrong. Income tax is 28% flat rate - more if you make more than 124.000€. The 78% is only for the oil industry - it is Norway's oil so the country should get the money

5987 2018-01-15 09:31:32 While in the workshop and thought maybe the time to take some very fine steel wool and some stock. Oil and actually get round to re-oiling and polishing the stock. I bet the hinges and lock on the gun cabinet could do with a bit of TLC.
5988 2018-01-15 09:31:06 That's what else people seem to forget. Russia as a country is so, so broke. Their main export is oil but they can't compete with the Saudis for that. Crony capitalism under Putin has stifled most domestic trade. They're not in a position to throw money at something like this.
5989 2018-01-15 09:30:40 I wonder if Cbd oil will help me
5990 2018-01-15 09:30:13 I hear you. I'm talking FIRS... those guys get paid like oil workers

5992 2018-01-15 09:29:07 ADVISORY: Petron will implement the following price increases (VAT incl) effective 6 a.m. tomorrow, January 16: P0.80/li for gasoline, P0.55/li for diesel, and P0.55/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market.
5993 2018-01-15 09:29:03 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
5994 2018-01-15 09:29:03 Becoz its uncharted territory no one will be able to turn up unannounced. Plenty of room to play..underground. plus there is great wealth to possibly mine there for gold gems oil.
5995 2018-01-15 09:28:53 Brilliant isn’t it when we can pay this sort of money from generated income and not oil money
United!!! biggest club in the world
5996 2018-01-15 09:27:49 It is agric and it is very important to generations of Nigerians. Every nation takes farming seriously even more than oil and diamond. Govt should do all it can to assist herdsmen the same way it is assisting States and individuals for rice, wheat and other grains production
5997 2018-01-15 09:27:21 We saw the effect of a relatively small drop in the value of oil, destroying SNP economic forecasts. That is the future. As the electric car is developed so OPEC will dump oil to squeeze out smaller producers and cash in whilst there is still a market for thick black shitty oil.
5998 2018-01-15 09:27:14 maybe i can use Gnocchi instead of fries...cook the gnocchi then toast them. ive done it before and if you add a little bit of olive oil and salt its delightful

6006 2018-01-15 09:24:46 You lot live in a dreamworld. It is estimated that 10/20% of Scotland's tax revenue would be based on oil, whereas that figure is 1.5% in the UK. Oil still has value but it is going the way of coal. As its value falls, so extraction from beneath the sea will become unviable.
6007 2018-01-15 09:24:29 It no longer seems to be the case that a few countries can control oil prices. In other words, cartels are being even less influential in oil markets.

6814 2018-01-15 06:41:10 Dude it’s soooo easy! I don’t use any oil at all. And it works fast!
6815 2018-01-15 06:41:01 So first they say Tesla is a bust, then 5 years later they invest 11 billion in EVs. Talking about having no vision what so ever. Above all, this is great news. The oil lobby has lost another fight. We're heading in the right direction. #ford #EVs
6816 2018-01-15 06:41:01 Thanatos still better, more gold and oil efficient. Trick is to spam those and snipers and just spam the walls as much as you can on every entrance to survive final wave.

6823 2018-01-15 06:40:00 #Oil prices held just below December 2014 highs on Monday on output cuts despite rising North American rig count. Brent crude futures prices, were at $69.85 per barrel, down 2 cents from their last close. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $64.40 a barrel, down 10 cents.

6825 2018-01-15 06:39:50 The black smoke would be from the ship's Bunker C fuel oil. FYI, condensate is not a type of crude oil.
6826 2018-01-15 06:39:40 Literally exfoliated, used a pore mask, and now have coconut oil on my face to keep some moisture.

6833 2018-01-15 06:37:52 Fiat currency is a complete joke. Only a small percentage is backed by gold/silver and some oil. Controlled entirely by the most evil monsters on earth. They ruined millions of lives in 08 and they will gladly do it again #FiatCurrency #blows #Banksters #CryptoCurrency
6834 2018-01-15 06:37:45 Should Nigerian dread high oil prices now? Higher oil price is suppose to translate into higher revenue for the govt. But instead it is turning into higher purnishment for Nigerian because of poor leadership.
6835 2018-01-15 06:37:16 You want heating in school ? Come to ghana , there are snakes in most junior high school  "hw33 tom" toilets. Some don't have at all ,you have to go to the bush or the beach . Thats a shit hole country. But oil & gold  is abundant sir!
6836 2018-01-15 06:36:48 I like it both ways but probably boiled or sautéed w butter I also like to bake them and make them crispy with olive oil and seasoning

6850 2018-01-15 06:34:39 For those who are strong arming everyone into electric vehicles really need for once to get out of the office and go into the public and ask them about it for 1 and then explain why they are doing it. Oil and gas endless. They polluted the air. GMO style.

6888 2018-01-15 06:26:08 Naw because it's used for more than fuel, pharmaceuticals for instance. It also depends on the kind of oil it is because it all can't be used for petrol etc

6978 2018-01-15 06:08:28 Think WWF's 'I buy, I care' campaign prompted 25,000 emails/signatures in 36 hours to pressure local firms to switch to sustainable palm oil. 10 companies have made the switch so far, so I guess it can work.

7044 2018-01-15 05:56:07 You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; you make sure it doesn’t stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs, eh? Add a little bit a wine…& a little bit a sugar

7071 2018-01-15 05:48:42 Also, as more institutions and investors rule out oil & gas financing, it gets more difficult for the industry to raise capital.
7072 2018-01-15 05:48:35 I would suggest try one products from them and see? And for acne scar my friend had really bad one and she did is Vitamin C in the morning and in the night she like “mixes” tea tree oil and vitamin E
7073 2018-01-15 05:48:23 I don't know about that. If you like that he's allowing industrial polution back into the streams. Yeah good move.
He's going to drill for oil off of our coasts? More polution and the inevitable leaks. He wanted to bring coal back when the coal industry was shutting it down. DUMB

7079 2018-01-15 05:46:10 Might not find him sending money to terrorist groups (except the KKK), no, but he will be sending money to the rich, rather than to the poor.

7087 2018-01-15 05:45:05 Hey, a little laugh for you. Oil can is also slang for can of beer. A Red Sox pitcher named Oil Can Boyd got that name for how much beer he can drink. 
7088 2018-01-15 05:44:59 Then how does that contradict his statement if at all what you said was right which is not?
7089 2018-01-15 05:44:45 Quite possibly, through weakening the dollar. For now it's dollar weakness that matters. Oil exporters buying gold across yuan futures for the moment is speculation. Watch this space...
7090 2018-01-15 05:44:39 Always the same theme: southern bumpkin gets offended that ANYONE thought he was Nuthin but Charitable!! Lyin Lyndon and Lyin Bill are similar players twixt oil n the people.

7093 2018-01-15 05:44:23 So now the attack on electric cars by the federal government has started.. the attack on low emissions vehicles to try to price them out of the market because the oil lobby is pushing the conservatives.. first the coal lobby, now the oil lobbyists.. #lnp #auspol
7094 2018-01-15 05:44:10 Oh yes! That is really painful. Tabasco, heatcreme, mint oil... These toys always have a great effect on male genitals. Did your mistress punish you? Did you feel this pain to amuse her? Or did she use Tabasco to show you your place?
7095 2018-01-15 05:44:08 No not weird, it was actually delicious like it had a hint of the coconut oil and the bud but it wasn't overpowering the meat and sauce
7096 2018-01-15 05:43:46 We do a 5 cups flour to 3 tsps baking soda ratio, then add milk til it's sticky but not too sticky. Stretch/knead chunks into thin circles and/or dongs, then fry in a couple of inches of oil, turning when the bottom is golden & they float on top of oil. Sorry its so imprecise lol
7097 2018-01-15 05:43:44 OILとかGOLDの高騰？
7098 2018-01-15 05:43:39 Yes, under Trump it's all rainbows and unicorns.  The stock market is soaring and some lucky Walmart employees will get an extra $40 per week.  Soon, oil rigs will extract their prize off our nation's coasts, national parks will be mined. Glory be! Minorities are maligned
7099 2018-01-15 05:43:36 I've always suspected Saudi oil sheikhs of being major heroin users or something of that sort, and it looks like I was partly right at least. They are responsible for a lot of moslem terrorism.

First things first STOP thinking ugly things about your skin Bc that’s only going to make it break out more !! 

Second - find a facial cleanser that’s for your type of skin (oily, dry, combination) 

Third - use a facial oil to keep your face moisturized :)

7172 2018-01-15 05:32:50 Yeah well one of the reasons why that fire we had on the Columbia Gorge got out of hand was because you just can't get along with reality that Trump is your president.  You complain about oil drilling, but could care less about wildfires.   2x Standards

7209 2018-01-15 05:27:03 Same holds true for oil and gas. For starters we don't need more exploration when it's obvious to most we will wean ourselves down to possibly off our dependence all together.

7255 2018-01-15 05:19:54 LOL. Forcing O&G companies to pay for natural occurrences is preposterous. Besides, who is to say it was their oil that caused it. Shouldn’t they also sue the equipment manufacturers that burn it? And the businesses/industries that use it? Ludicrous.

7327 2018-01-15 05:06:45 Remember that high quality olive oil goes rancid at 400, so maybe use coconut oil? If you’re not a fan of the taste be sure to get refined (I’m forever grabbing the wrong one).

7397 2018-01-15 04:55:38 Mr. Tramp, what is your profit by dividing up Muslim countries with the sale of old weapons and oil. It's a blessing among Muslims that will end in your eyes and the oppressed people of America. Peace-loving is the long-standing desire of the human race.

7404 2018-01-15 04:55:12 There wasn't fracking, which causes untold millions of dollars in preventable illnesses, but oil companies own Congress.  This is all about corruption--and holding health care hostage is just one more symptom.

7418 2018-01-15 04:52:27 Oil markets remain a strategic platform in the global positioning for influence & power. Environmental impact will remain ignored.

7429 2018-01-15 04:49:47 Diffusing them, no. It's not harmful. It would have to be in a small small box with the oils to harm it. The pure oil (not diffused/diluted) is harmful, yes.
7430 2018-01-15 04:49:39 And add oil do it don’t stick.

7444 2018-01-15 04:48:10 So we’re building a lot of nuclear power plants in the next 5 years? Oh, I forgot. The vast majority of electricity comes from coal, natural gas, and oil burning turbines. Or is it from unicorn and Tinker Bell dust?

7452 2018-01-15 04:46:25 Nobody said matatus are unprofitable. I even said they are tolerated because they oil politics and keep lowly-paid policemen happy.
Further, I said they employ millions. Obviously, that happens on profit. The debate was, and is, why the profit motive has not caused safe outcomes.

7512 2018-01-15 04:37:57 ah; you are perhaps skipping over the "means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc." part

that's not an incidental part

for example, it's the lack of that part that makes SS & Medicare not "socialism"

7551 2018-01-15 04:30:58 Oil palm for biofuel was to have been one of the best solutions in saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming. Instead the forests are being torn down in the headlong rush to boost palm oil production.

7553 2018-01-15 04:30:11 Thieves! All of the health support, particularly in the mouth! Love to put it in coconut oil for oil pulling, and add a drop to be toothbrush when brushing too.
7554 2018-01-15 04:29:41 I don’t use my vaporizer all the time anymore because my cat Zina would sit beside it and smell the vapours. It was lavender or a oil blend called “Stress Away”. She never seemed to show distress, however, and was able to leave when she wanted.
7555 2018-01-15 04:29:39 Is this oil or acrylic?
7556 2018-01-15 04:29:37 I’d like to thank broccoli, red potatoes, and olive oil for always having my back 
Idk wtf I’d have for dinner when I’m lazy without u

7558 2018-01-15 04:29:21 The argument in favor of nuclear power is that even Chernobyl isn't as bad as what oil and coal have done/are doing/will do, just more concentrated.

However, I've read about Chernobyl, and it's HORRIFIC. And the mess there will outlive humans as a species.
7559 2018-01-15 04:29:20 Before I issues a Red card to PMB & his team. You need to let me know your policy differences. What are u going to do differently.

7560 2018-01-15 04:29:01 Bringing my essential oil defuser to work on Tuesday and I don’t know what I’m more excited for. Either for classroom smelling nice or for the oils making the kids chill the heck out.
7561 2018-01-15 04:28:33 The sound of my oil diffuser is seriously so peaceful 
7562 2018-01-15 04:28:20 Is there anything green tea or coconut oil can't solve?
7563 2018-01-15 04:28:19 starting from 2015... ALL vehicles will be "electrified"... LOL no more oil & gas, ever!
7564 2018-01-15 04:27:51 A really great point until you take into account all of the baseload that is filling the need falls off the table. Which of course is what API and big oil wants to happen. Of course you want the scarcity to drive gas prices way up. #marketsworkforbigoilwhennothingelseisleft
7565 2018-01-15 04:27:38 I like that *warm* oil is specified

7581 2018-01-15 04:25:02 I can't imagine the impact of an oil rig disaster off the coast of new England. The pollution would wipe out fishing from cape cod to old England....like as in British England.

7584 2018-01-15 04:24:31 Combined cycle natural gas is better than other fossil-fueled alternatives (coal/oil), but releases nontrivial amounts of GHGs, as well as criteria pollutants like NOx that are hazardous to human health for those living nearby (more likely to be POC).

7608 2018-01-15 04:21:11 Interesting. The 8.7G barrels is the estimate for 'technically recoverable' oil, but unexplored rocks might have nearly ten times this.
7609 2018-01-15 04:20:50 What horseis this? Alternative energy is the future. Trying to stop this is akin to stop the mighty Mississippi from moving. Those are the jobs of the future. Oil is going the way of dinosaurs. Get with the program

7635 2018-01-15 04:16:43 About as many times as he mentioned the uncontrollable fires - never! He seems to think he's only President of Red States, not blue ones. And he'll only give exemptions for oil drilling if he owns a fancy, expensive club on the same ocean.

7705 2018-01-15 04:07:01 Leave time to prepare your meals at home. Nuts are filling and avacados. Try not to overload on carbs. Coconut oil is great for cooking. Olive oil for cold stuff.

7707 2018-01-15 04:06:49 I’m not sure I should be putting this Slim&Sassy oil blend in my water.  I don’t think it’s going to magically make me slim, but it’s got a refreshing taste... if it makes me more sassy however... I’m not sure my friends and family are ready for that.

7726 2018-01-15 04:03:31 Just look at the sources of the "money". Free (inherited, oil, logging, laundered, tax-dodging, Rent-seeking), the money has no "value" to those who control it.  The numbers are just the "score" in the game of egos. The plot cost 500k, but 500k what? Not ££ as we know them!

7742 2018-01-15 04:01:18 D14: Here's a poem I wrote about my MC:  
Reason and fate intertwine as well as oil spills on water,
The urgent riddle weighs on her mind,
Love’s fog settles,
To protect a kingdom and resurrect another,
With calm infusing her, 
Companions wait.

7744 2018-01-15 04:01:17 For example: with China's maritime belt one should question the possible exacerbation of the ivory trade - which is already tremendously bad. Further, China like the US, the UK etc continue to mine for uranium and coal in Africa, as well as oil of course.
7745 2018-01-15 04:01:16 They let them die everyday for oil, money and klan principles! Let’s be real! But in theory, you’re right. If that were reality, your GOP would have voted YES! But they voted NO!
7746 2018-01-15 04:01:14 That is everyone else wondering why you think it isn't the total dependency on oil reserves and public planning for the economy that resulted in their troubles, but instead the lack of "blockchain."

7754 2018-01-15 04:00:00 When you drop food into a deep fryer and the oil starts bubbling, it's not boiling—moisture is actually boiling off the surface of the food.
7755 2018-01-15 03:59:58 I assume the oil floats to the surface, which means you can collect it.

7849 2018-01-15 03:43:45 @nationalpost - if you want me to complete a survey on how favourably I view several industries, such as the energy sector, don't lump oil and gas in with solar. #badsurvey

7861 2018-01-15 03:42:00 I'm watching Julia Child make mayonnaise. She says that to set up the emulsion properly, you need to keep dripping in the oil "even if the children are falling out the windows or if the cat's in the canary cage."  That's why we love her!

7868 2018-01-15 03:41:15 Why would she give him a BJ if she didn't like him?  Say "drop me off at home.  I'm not feeling it." When did women become so pathetic?  I'm embarrassed by her.

7880 2018-01-15 03:39:22 I wonder -- can anyone come up with a better bottle/dispenser for putting rinse agent in a dishwasher?  Come on, they got the spout for engine oil.  I will stick with the brand that comes out with an easy pour bottle.
7881 2018-01-15 03:39:14 No meat for you...stick to salads and spiced veggies...cook with olive oil....try combos of beans, hummus, legumes and veggies.. if not gluten intolerant fillup on carbs...just try new stuff

7884 2018-01-15 03:38:54 this is relatively new development but it could be because I'm now using witch hazel with rose water as a toner, and have started using just straight up bio oil as a moisturizer lmaoo
7885 2018-01-15 03:38:36 Bad enough GOP is owned by big oil but now Russia too.

7888 2018-01-15 03:38:12 Leaving oil in my hair is an amazing turn out but havin it moisturize my hair while it drips down my face and neck n all that ain’t the most enjoyable feeling 
7889 2018-01-15 03:38:10 What oil ?
7890 2018-01-15 03:38:08 Honestly, I am a hopeless pleb and I use baby oil. Cheap, won't go rancid, non-allergenic AFAIK, vegan, non-toxic. Haven't had issues.
7891 2018-01-15 03:38:02 Castor oil Babe!!!
7892 2018-01-15 03:37:12 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
7893 2018-01-15 03:36:57 My landlord really heats this whole house with the wood from the trees outside so he doesn't have to pay for oil. How smart is that

7910 2018-01-15 03:33:35 You stand in a room with curved walls, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on an end table.
7911 2018-01-15 03:33:35 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
7912 2018-01-15 03:33:35 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7918 2018-01-15 03:32:58 You literally only need a little bit of olive oil, extra virgin... Apply to the ends of your hair half an hour to an hour before washing it. Do this  once or twice a week I guarantee it helps a ton and it's also super natural
7919 2018-01-15 03:32:55 就活なので休み増えますって言っといて卒業まで続けるつもり
7920 2018-01-15 03:32:51 Anyone need oil pens lmk on deck
7921 2018-01-15 03:32:27 My hair has gone through it all and the only thing saving it is sweet almond oil and coconut oil, one of them every night before bed on the ends like a quarter size amount and it helps soo much
7922 2018-01-15 03:32:25 Just make your own with chocolate chips and coconut oil.  None of those ingredients you can't pronounce.
7923 2018-01-15 03:32:22 I’m using argan oil and it leaves my hair so soft even tho i’ve dyed
7924 2018-01-15 03:32:15 When I bought that diffuser for oil I got grapefruit oil, I'm not really sure why. I can tell you that diffused grapefruit oil in the evening is not relaxing.
7925 2018-01-15 03:32:03 I somewhat agree. Oil sands, in its infancy, was risky. If gov't congress tax breaks, then it's not really a cost. If profitable in future; great deal. 
Actual tax dollars going to teams. Big difference.

7940 2018-01-15 03:29:55 I have trouble making my kernel densities pop sometimes, though I think it has more to do with getting the oil hot enough because I don't think it has anything to do with my histogram reactions as I'm very careful to stay clear of cats, dust and mold.

7946 2018-01-15 03:28:38 Training myself to cook with less oil.  
7947 2018-01-15 03:28:34 Need @RachakondaCop  Commissioner action in this case. For years oil stealing from @IndianOilcl & other tankers racket in Chengicherla & Cherlapalli areas reported in News Papers - No action neither from Oil Companies or Police. This incident may be a big eye opener.

7951 2018-01-15 03:27:47 Coconut oil has been the best thing for keeping my lashes healthy, long, and full
7952 2018-01-15 03:27:40 If equity bubble pops doesn’t demand for oil decrease dramatically?
7953 2018-01-15 03:27:39 At least you put castor and coconut oil on them so hopefully the spots will grow back better than before
7954 2018-01-15 03:27:22 Someone want to meet for an early breakfast in the morning??? I need to get my oil changed.
7955 2018-01-15 03:27:03 Leave in conditioner only for my beard from now on. No more oil, fuck that shit

7957 2018-01-15 03:26:51 I do the same, with slices of zucchini & squash. Tastes great! Spray olive oil, season with "Hot Shot" pepper blend, or something similar.
7958 2018-01-15 03:26:48 This sounds like a really dumb idea.

Premined

Is there any issuance cap?

Backed by oil? How does that work?

Is it open source?

Dumb assed governments can't get anything right...
7959 2018-01-15 03:26:48 People from Spain are annoying when it comes to olive oil, they think they fucking own olive oil lol...
7960 2018-01-15 03:26:40 Why do our bodies secrete oil and grease , are we being marinated for consumption by the gods

7965 2018-01-15 03:26:01 I use it at night, especially after I take off my makeup. it leave my face feeling super clean and not stripped. Then I follow up with my vitamin E oil.
7966 2018-01-15 03:25:48 No

7970 2018-01-15 03:24:56 I had missed parent company underneath some brands. Uncle Tobys (parent Nestle), Nabisco (Kraft), Glad Wrap (Clorox), Pantene (Proctor & Gamble) on issues of Palm Oil, Child Slavery & other, although some companies have pledged commitment to improving practices in some areas.
7971 2018-01-15 03:24:52 No more oil in the beard man I fucked up a hoodie for the LAST TIME!
7972 2018-01-15 03:24:29 It’s normal practice Tom in Kenya to spray from plane with neat glyphosate plus oil or diesel. It’s not just glyphosate.

7977 2018-01-15 03:22:39 Roast almost any veggie in ur oven at 420, from 10 min (asparagus) to 20 min (potatoes cut in 1/2" pieces). Toss first with Montreal Steak Seasoning & a lil olive oil. Tastes great, low cal, healthy.
7978 2018-01-15 03:22:07 Will it make it worse? Didn’t Calgary’s coach do this very thing last season or the year before and their PP amounts actually went considerably up? Though I don’t know if he called them out or had like a formal meeting ..
7979 2018-01-15 03:21:54 Soon you will see oil platforms
7980 2018-01-15 03:21:28 Teatree oil! Salicylic cleanser use once a day and regular cleanser in the morning. Toner makes a world of a difference and moisturize with a light weight moisturizer! Exfoliate 2-3 times a week then switch to 2!
7981 2018-01-15 03:21:23 Bidang oil and gas cun gak ni.
7982 2018-01-15 03:21:12 Hahaha. I got blocked by quote tweeting a Braves fan reminding them that the Braves are only gonna be a .500 team this year. 

Everyone got sold some snake oil about how quick and guaranteed that rebuild was gonna be.
7983 2018-01-15 03:20:31 Natural state such as fruits, vegetables, beans, eggs, fresh meat and fish. Also another problem is that i can’t cook in the same oil that food with gluten has been cooked or cut with a knife that has cut smthg with gluten so I can’t eat in restaurants either, that’s called

7989 2018-01-15 03:19:39 No matter who tf it is liberals will find a reason to demonize them. Be it a video from ‘07 of them not supporting cannabis legalization or reports of a Monsanto/big oil donation in ‘12 they’ll find a reason to hate them. I hope not but this sh*t happens every election.

7991 2018-01-15 03:19:17 Soyrizo is good. Plan meals in advance because at times cooking can be long. If dining out a non vegan place feel free to ask if things are cooked in butter or oil. First days you’ll be tired. Find protein in beans and nuts

7998 2018-01-15 03:18:32 Yeah, ketosis is great and I'm all about cyclical ketogenic diets! My main issue is people trying to lose weight by eating only cheese sticks, lunch meat, and coconut oil and thinking that's healthy and sustainable and telling everyone else to do it.

8006 2018-01-15 03:16:43 ~ Refused to allow. Watchful spy slid through Ifrit magic akin to shimmering oil slick, flame dripping from lips curved cruel amusement at his king's antics. Magic poured heat over Ifrit skin, magma clearing to human blue.

And there, the messenger, on bended knees. Waiting.

8008 2018-01-15 03:16:09 National Oilwell Varco is a trash company. Oil prices are up and taxes are down and somehow they still managed to find a way to lay off loyal employees.
8009 2018-01-15 03:15:40 As it stands, our nation's landfills are overflowing while our oil reserves are rapidly depleting.

8015 2018-01-15 03:14:59 Your country has oil. 
Your country had an election last year. 
Your country has hiked  prices in mid January. 

Why do people vote?
8016 2018-01-15 03:14:49 y'all I really hate the fact my go to valve oil is called Hetman's
8017 2018-01-15 03:14:47 こっち10日以上余ってて使いきれない
8018 2018-01-15 03:14:42 You just got through telling me that with all this new oil drilling Trump is starting the prices would drop wtf
8019 2018-01-15 03:14:26 Texas is a mixed bag right now due to extended period of low oil prices. Here in Austin everyone is shitting money, but Houston, Midland, etc isn’t the same story.
8020 2018-01-15 03:14:13 It really depends on your skin type + concerns! But I would def recommend an oil cleanser, a low ph cleanser, moisturizer and spf as a starter to start seeing a change! And then certain products for different concerns
8021 2018-01-15 03:13:34 I found a $10 bullet proof lipstick that i literally just had to rub an insane amount of olive oil on my lips to take it off  not sure when i got back into makeup but I’ve missed it
8022 2018-01-15 03:13:32 And get Your Amsoil oil change, and flush. Flushing helps engine and trans to stay cool.

8026 2018-01-15 03:13:16 Today sucked right from the moment the clock passed midnight, but I am alive, I have a job, a home, a full oil tank, and friends and family who care about me, and for that I am grateful.

In less than two hours, a better day will begin. #namaste

8029 2018-01-15 03:12:47 @The_Japan_News  calling the drilling of the mantle a debunk and it sounds like a oil chase and its such a waste of money. Always searching wrong places for resources .. hire #gna its the future > mantle is `100s miles away from the ocean floor? they never been? so how they know?
8030 2018-01-15 03:12:47 He sold her his snake oil and she bought it. Sadly those who were brainwashed and gaslighted are slowly realizing that he is and was a liar and a thief! Too late.

8037 2018-01-15 03:11:39 I worked in the oil fields in West Texas. If they have the technology to find oil from helicopters I’m sure a tunnel would be a piece of cake. Amazing the tech they can put  in 2 1/8 inch tubing
8038 2018-01-15 03:11:38 Heat Protectants: CHI Silk Infusion, pure brassica oil, my stylist's personal line . Other than making sure it's ionic and high wattage, I got nothing on the blow-dryers lol. I do use a denman brush.

The girls be co-washing down and I’m not mad but a good surfactant is necessary to get that dirt and oil up out of those pores Sis
Scalp smelling like salt and vinegar chips
8044 2018-01-15 03:10:47 tea tree oil smells sooooo good
8045 2018-01-15 03:10:44 If Canada builds Canada East pipeline it will eliminate need for foreign oil from oil tankers in Cdn waters, ie safer, also economically better. Try to explain that to the Liberal gov't. though.

8052 2018-01-15 03:10:28 You forgot to oil the soil first
8053 2018-01-15 03:10:21 Is it wash day? Ouidad’s Ultra-Nourishing Cleansing Oil mimics hair’s natural oils to replenish essential moisture, as it removes dirt and build-up, while keeping hydrated and nourished curls!
8054 2018-01-15 03:10:20 Shout out to my partner, making me tea & smoothies, rubbing my aching back with mentholated cannabis oil, & generally making me want to survive this flu.
8055 2018-01-15 03:10:06 This is how you're supposed to make more accessible homes (no snake oil.)
8056 2018-01-15 03:09:49 รอๆๆๆๆคร้าาา
8057 2018-01-15 03:09:37 BTW a lot of the oil in Nigeria os owned by multi national companies like BP. They extract the wealth from countries like Nigeria and remit it to the U.S. UK or elsewhere

8063 2018-01-15 03:08:37 He should come out and face the music, either he's guilty as sin, or he's a massive conspiracy theorist (both can be true). The guy is a bell-end and a snake oil salesman. No tears will be shed for this man

8065 2018-01-15 03:08:26 I very literally used to pass my new rope through my sweaty gym clothes every day for 6 weeks, then it's reconditioned each time I tie. But that takes too fucking long so now I use a blend of beeswax and coconut oil. Never had a kit long enough for any oil to go rancid.
8066 2018-01-15 03:08:09 Hahah. Move south, seriously. You think the U.S is responsible for the Canadian economy doing well? They are the reason Alberta went into an oil recession. NAFTA threats from Trump are damaging the Canadian markets. We are doing well in spite of Trump.
8067 2018-01-15 03:07:42 Have to Agree.

There use to be discipline, rules, etiquette. Traditions were set. 

@realDonaldTrump has thrown dedication to an ideal out the window. HeS a loud mouth Self-promoter. HeS a saleman willing to use deplorable methods for the sale. IVe heard my limit snake oil sales

8070 2018-01-15 03:07:13 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
8071 2018-01-15 03:07:06 Haircut not so much! I cut it myself, sometimes fo-hawk, straight back or to the side. Really only needs gel... Now the beard is a LOT of Maintenance!!! Special soap, wax, oil, brush.Trimming every couple of days!! In a couple of weeks would b longest without cutting it back down
8072 2018-01-15 03:07:01 A singe, a wipe with a cloth, and a very light treatment with a mixture of mineral oil/wax. I feel the wax keeps the rope from getting frizzy as quickly, tho I repeat treatment when it does.
8073 2018-01-15 03:06:51 The dollar index is trading at a new 3-year low in Asia, and the dollar is breaking down against the Chinese yuan, likely headed below 6-to-1 for the 1st time ever. Gold and oil are both higher.  This could escalate quickly.  U.S. investors on holiday should take notice.
8074 2018-01-15 03:06:45 Some use a store-bought barbecue rub, some have standard Buffalo wing sauce, and some are Asian: Sesame oil, sesame seeds, togarashi, and coconut aminos. None are particularly spicy. Tasty, though.
8075 2018-01-15 03:06:37 Either it's saturated or you burning tons of oil 
8076 2018-01-15 03:06:37 OOH i forgot that tea tree oil worked for me before i’ll try that again too maybe
8077 2018-01-15 03:06:36 What will be unhelpful is when those "shitholes" shut down their real shit and we get shat on. How, pray tell? Real shit is Coltan from the Congo, Tungsten and tin from Rwanda,  Gold and oil from Nigeria. As my momma used to say, You don't miss your water, til your well run dry.
8078 2018-01-15 03:06:23 Hahaha I just used the pre-made sauce packs. Heat oil in pan, brown meat, in our case I added lots of chili oil, Diced chili's, 5 spice and then I added the sauce and simmered it with the tofu. Super easy but not the best if you can afford the time to make the sauce from scratch
8079 2018-01-15 03:06:15 I  suing oil companies almost as much as I  my Chevy Tahoe.

8087 2018-01-15 03:05:01 Where's the media outcry about environmental impact?? Oh I get it, it's not a pipeline and it's foreign oil not Canadian oil.

8089 2018-01-15 03:04:50 I'll mix some oil paint tgt to get the colour of marmite and spread it on two slices of bread. There ya go, my take on a homemade marmite sandwich. You need some turpentine to wash down the paint? 
8090 2018-01-15 03:04:13 But yes, canola is probably the best seed oil.
8091 2018-01-15 03:04:05 aloe vera, bamboo water, sunflower oil, vitamin c scrub will truly save ur skin in winter
8092 2018-01-15 03:04:00 Is there an essential oil for procrastination
8093 2018-01-15 03:03:49 OK, fair enough :-) Mr Butts actually stated 'coal is over' and not 'oil is over' so I stand corrected.
8094 2018-01-15 03:03:49 Better oil won't smoke. Try grapeseed if you're feeling fancy, but even olive oil is better than vegetable. Has a v low smoke point
8095 2018-01-15 03:03:31 Biases existed then, too. Teller was looking for peaceful uses of atomic energy and even the bomb. Electrical energy was a big argument to go nuclear.
8096 2018-01-15 03:03:25 So ironic when City fans start talking about money being the reason why Sanchez would choose united when city are a club who would be in division 2 without that oil money #ManUtd #ManCity #AlexisSanchez #Sanchez #Wenger
8097 2018-01-15 03:03:16 These girls on reality shows be having all that oil caked up and shiny between they're boobs!
8098 2018-01-15 03:03:12 and the oil corporation's want to increase tanker traffic in B.C. waters. No thanks.
8099 2018-01-15 03:03:00 So Walker takes Sentinel for his flea/tick medication, and it’s a chewable. But he HATES it and will NOT eat it. SMF crumbles it into pieces and puts coconut oil on it and he gobbles it up.

8120 2018-01-15 02:59:53 Amazing article. It seems that few -if any?- Latin American countries used the past decade's oil boom wisely. Many short improvements, little structural changes. The numbers given in the article are terrifying.
8121 2018-01-15 02:59:50 @getjackblack beard oil, lip balm, face wash, cologne, all of it. Ya need it.
8122 2018-01-15 02:59:34 You can't really pick on a nation bouncing back from a major disaster. Japan is not necessarily a shithole country but it's still leaking nuclear waste into the oceans. British Petroleum dumped oil into our Gulf Coast. Keystone Pipeline XL is polluting during construction

8128 2018-01-15 02:58:53 I have run into this a lot at my thankfully soon-to-be-ex day job, which deals with the oil industry a lot. It boils down to "this person who says that the environment is important makes me feel icky inside, so I'm gonna come up with a reason why they suck."

8136 2018-01-15 02:58:00 Soap and Glory has a face wash that has Yuzu in it that has really done wonders for me. I use that at night and the Origins zero oil wash in the morning
8137 2018-01-15 02:57:59 @tide how do you prepare your PODS? I like mine with salt, pepper, and a little olive oil in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes. Then a little lemon juice on top right before eating. #tidepods #tidepodmeals
8138 2018-01-15 02:57:52 Me encantaria un sweater de esos para mi coleccion de memorabilia del mercado.... Hablando de eso, por alli me deben una gorra de Crude Oil
8139 2018-01-15 02:57:34 Ohh that's a pretty fire routine. I would just suggest using an exfoliating sponge/glove/cloth with your face wash and switching the rose hip seed oil with viatmin E oil. I struggled for a while until I did that. The witch hazel as a toner is good too 
8140 2018-01-15 02:56:48 @Wendys what should I buy at Wendy's

8151 2018-01-15 02:54:12 Went to eat at #karims at India Islamic centre LODHI road #fail . Too much oil and no drama around it

3. Pasta salad - short pasta with grilled veggies 
4. Cheesy pasta bake
5. With smokey eggplant, garlic, olive oil, lemon peel

And, oh, anything else!
8158 2018-01-15 02:53:05 It's just basically an oil base (like coconut or grapeseed oil) that you use to dilute the essential oils because some oils are very potent and you can't use it straight out of the bottle.
8159 2018-01-15 02:52:44 We live in a world where people think you can put coconut oil and lemon juice on your gray hairs and it’ll turn it back to your natural hair color
8160 2018-01-15 02:52:24 Well, I'm out of oil. Going to be a very cold week.
8161 2018-01-15 02:52:20 De'Souza ain't any oil painting himself.
8162 2018-01-15 02:52:12 Lol well...You said you’re calling the cops..so I asked was it cause of the fill in and cuticle oil she needs or cause of the outlaws..?
8163 2018-01-15 02:52:10 How many people and cans of olive oil does it take to get Mariah into her dress for awards shows ?
8164 2018-01-15 02:52:05 Grease isn't glow! grease isn't glow! grease isn't glow! say it with me coconut oil twitter!

8168 2018-01-15 02:51:42 @GovCanHealth @JodieEmery This is more good news, looks like we finally won the failed War on Cannabis with education. They all need to Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850...they'll get 9pgs of them. It's far Healthier to eat it than smoke it though. #cdnpoli #uspoli
8169 2018-01-15 02:51:41 The light oil ones actually apply too, because Rachel Chandler was very active and involved in shooting my clones back then.  I didn't see her as much later, but for awhile, she was.
8170 2018-01-15 02:51:31 What parts of Popeye never rust?

The parts he puts in Olive Oil.
8171 2018-01-15 02:51:29 The point is not that we trade it is that we do not rely solely on NAFTA for that and that the system will not collapse without it. And as for oil, hydro, and lumber we do not rely on Canada but u'll find that Canada produces more than it can consume, so we keep them in business.
8172 2018-01-15 02:51:21 Sorry ah, I don't know what carrier oil is.
8173 2018-01-15 02:51:20 Carabbas is so greasy. I don’t see how ppl actually enjoy eating there. Each dish is cooked in a gallon of olive oil

8178 2018-01-15 02:50:39 Thirding mineral oil. And no wax. Bc the oil won’t penetrate the rope and do what it’s supposed to do next time you oil. I currently oil on average every 4-5 weeks.
8179 2018-01-15 02:50:39 You can never go wrong with coconut water, milk, or oil. Coconuts never do wrong 
8180 2018-01-15 02:50:32 Regulations R extremely necessary in th USA.

8182 2018-01-15 02:50:18 its so cold outside and I've seen so many canada goose jackets I thought it would like $100 but really im just surrounded by oil money folks
8183 2018-01-15 02:50:06 I hope when I get to heaven god gives me a pass for accidentally using blessing oil as lube.......
8184 2018-01-15 02:50:01 Pasta with peas. Fry chopped white onions in olive oil, salt, and pepper until they're translucent and add a can of peas for every half pound of pasta. Boil the peas, make pasta, use the peas as sauce. Sounds weird but it's the best

And these are all vegan, so bonus points there
8185 2018-01-15 02:50:01 I think like that best to mix with carrier oil and apply on your body, instead of diffusing it.
8186 2018-01-15 02:49:56 Remember the old dude inside the oil tanker in Waterworld?
8187 2018-01-15 02:49:53 8pm meal : sardines, frozen veggies, bowl oatmeal with cup yogurt. Slow protein after dark mother fuckers.

8192 2018-01-15 02:49:15 MY EXCEMA ON MY EYELIDS AND SIDES OF MY NOSE IS OUT OF CONTROL  slathering coconut oil on.  So frustrating!! Especially when you're required to wear makeup to work + your skin just needs a break.

8196 2018-01-15 02:48:54 Just caught the mayor of NYC on NY1 blaming oil companies for Hurricane Sandy so obviously he's running in 2020.
8197 2018-01-15 02:48:38 The culture where being a criminal is cool needs to stop, people should be happy when they are caught n willingly give information to help catch them.

8208 2018-01-15 02:47:02 Precisely! 

My son-in-law worked for Halliburton in North Dakota for five years, earning $85k/yr. When oil dropped below $30, he was laid off, and he has struggled mightily ever since then. My point being that your argument that low oil = votes is not logical nor persuasive.
8209 2018-01-15 02:46:50 Right I’ve absolutely went off chippies now. After that fuckin greasy shit I’d rather drink the cooking oil straight from the fryer.
8210 2018-01-15 02:46:45 Fuck I just dropped a tray from the oven and spilled 400 degree oil on my leg oven-1 pat-0

8215 2018-01-15 02:46:30 Oh God, I fell in to a YouTube black hole after searching “coconut oil for eyelash growth,” and wound up on some hippie’s channel about using it in lieu of traditional birth control.
8216 2018-01-15 02:46:26 @FatKidDeals do y’all still have the coconut oil?
8217 2018-01-15 02:46:20 You know that whole coconut oil thing is all just a marketing invention, right?

8223 2018-01-15 02:45:14 We have spent the last sixty years building up this international organization called the United Nations, which is meant to avoid wars! @UN And now we just blow thousands of people up over barrels of oil for our car's and a photo opportunity on the White House lawn! Why?
8224 2018-01-15 02:45:10 The interrogs were a mite misleading I'm glad you agree as this particular brand of oil spill is one that is more damaging than others...we have already ruined far too much with oil spill and can scare afford to have it happen again.
8225 2018-01-15 02:45:07 Zucchini fries (google recipe. Mmm...) and oven roasted brussel sprouts. Just put some oil, salt, and pepper on them. Mmm again.

8230 2018-01-15 02:44:39 China is delighted.
Africa has oil. And coltan. Guess who won't be getting it easily in the future.

This was/is/will be an incredibly stupid act for a stable genius.
8231 2018-01-15 02:44:30 Yes!!!! Only,  I’m in the early EARLY stages of learning about this stuff and just making lists of the ones I wanna attempt.. you’re far advanced! That looks yummy and beautiful!! I wanna try it! 
I can send you pics of my crazy essential oil collection tho .. it’s pretty sexy 
8232 2018-01-15 02:44:28 Yes it can happen, The "Glass of olive Oil and lemon Juice" "natural" treatment might allow some to pass but at risk of pancreatitis and some stones are calcified and/or to big and will never pass. Drug dissolution can work but side effects ++, but probably not HF diet after.
8233 2018-01-15 02:44:25 I've used milled flax and cinnamon mixed in cold almond milk before. Then made sure the pan was nice n greasy coconut oil or earth balance.
8234 2018-01-15 02:43:59 Somebody grab the oil can for the ump chairs and use it on the roof. #AusOpen
8235 2018-01-15 02:43:58 Just made a quiche: roasted red onions, spinach on olive oil foiled cookie sheets, added chopped garlic to the spinach in last 2 min. Paracooked pie shell, lined w veggies and shredded mozzarella & cheddar. Poured 3 eggs & milk, seasoned, over, and baked 325. Mmm.
8236 2018-01-15 02:43:52 We're fine. I just had a feeling & popped the hood when u got there. Oil EVERYWHERE. We have a ride home. Need to tow her.
8237 2018-01-15 02:43:39 Yes.
8238 2018-01-15 02:43:20 Common sense says don’t drill in the Ocean! It’s hurting the earth as well as the air we breathe. Stop the oil companies from killing new technologies that make us independent from oil before it’s to late.
8239 2018-01-15 02:43:19 Yes, yes she does. And so do ALL Oregonians.

We. Don't. Need. The. Oil. OR. The. Risk. Of. A. Spill.

Please listen @GOP. 

If you want to drill so badly, do it in your backyard first, NOT ours.

8250 2018-01-15 02:42:33 didn't they end Meals-On-Wheels, severely cripple Heating oil for seniors and the poor in rural and colder regions of our country... they gutted food assistance programs and are bankrupting our social safety net with the Tax Bill... I Hope History & Karma are Not kind to them!

8258 2018-01-15 02:41:48 Runaway inflation coming.  How about the price of oil last week?
8259 2018-01-15 02:41:47 RK hydrating lip oil is my fav clear lip gloss, and it's like $2.

8261 2018-01-15 02:41:26 Couldn’t happen to a more-deserving industry. Not that I’m inclined to believe you, mind you. But if there are better places to go fishing for evidence of willful damage to the world for short term profit than the oil industry, I don’t know ‘em.
8262 2018-01-15 02:41:26 Exactly ...3-4-1-2... both up front, oil behind them.
8263 2018-01-15 02:41:23 my comforter smells like almond now because an oil scenty thingy was open in the bag I trustingly set on my bed

8265 2018-01-15 02:41:14 I would not do that.  First, mineral oil is much more viscous than normal coolants used, Second, not sure why issues mineral oil would cause.  My guess is not many, from a chemical change/reaction standpoint.  But I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish using mineral oil.
8266 2018-01-15 02:40:44 Aren't oil paintings messy?
8267 2018-01-15 02:40:33 tea tree oil!!!
8268 2018-01-15 02:40:26 Your comparison is out of point, so because Ekiti is in Nigeria that is why your president will take their land and give to cattle rearers? Is cattle rearing part of the federal government responsibility? Is money from the cattle rearing shared among states like oil revenue??
8269 2018-01-15 02:40:26 You were the oil to my water.

8301 2018-01-15 02:35:34 Oil is not at all great. I'm saying that an oil spill is immensely damaging and this particular refinement of petroleum is even worse than a "regular" oil spill.

8446 2018-01-15 02:12:11 I don’t smoke. Just apply the oil like a topical to the injured area

8448 2018-01-15 02:11:49 That's not the main reason though, those are just added bonuses. The main reason is that legal cannabis will still have too many people lose money who are invested in things like alcohol, pharma, oil, plastics, cotton, forest, etc. It's why it was made illegal in first place.
8449 2018-01-15 02:11:46 .@CCTV on social media on Saturday quoted its reporter over the scene saying Sanchi oil spill ‘situation is very serious’. Earlier it quoted state oceanic admin engineer down playing impact #China
8450 2018-01-15 02:11:43 I did a face mask, washed my face with a really nice cleanser and put coconut oil on my face and now I'm sitting in bed with a cup of tea, simple things count as self care!! and they make you feel great about yourself because life is a solid 9 rn
8451 2018-01-15 02:11:34 Agreed! The system needs to be smashed!!! I’m not suggesting anything except that we do live in a country where big money and big oil, pharm, run EVERYTHING we see, hear, and decide for the majority as they are sheep! I want to free the sheep! Wake the F*#% UP!!!
8452 2018-01-15 02:11:33 Coconut oil in coffee + cream, or instead of cream?
8453 2018-01-15 02:11:31 Paid my bills, washed/put oil in my car, did laundry, cleaned room, now working on my website. New job starts on Tuesday, here we go. #adulting
8454 2018-01-15 02:11:26 Feeling sorry for themselves and celebrating themselves. Lol
If America is so great why would Americans always want to go to another country and attack. Because America has poor living conditions. So they have to attack oil filled country to grab loot the oil.
8455 2018-01-15 02:11:14 well, its new so just start with the oil changes!

Maybe he should have paid more attention!
8464 2018-01-15 02:10:07 I'm not light on my feet, now I clank and I squeak
But my voice is the same when I speak
My hand looks like aluminum foil
Does this mean that I need a tune-up and a change of oil?
8465 2018-01-15 02:10:04 Use that coconut oil for everythangg
8466 2018-01-15 02:10:03 Or tax any gasoline or oil product distributor using oil from the company who drilled it, painfully, make them want it!!

8471 2018-01-15 02:08:33 I honestly do not care what you think about Snopes. There is no peanut oil in vaccines. But continue to attack the messenger instead of the message if that makes you feel smart.

8476 2018-01-15 02:07:44 You clearly do no know what you’re talking about. There is no such thing as a vaccine “carrier oil.”
8477 2018-01-15 02:07:19 Make it past state waters and tax the the oil at 95% of market value, distributed to the citizens of NJ. If Alaska can condition it, get smart!!
8478 2018-01-15 02:06:56 There is also the fact that US Pres was totally preoccupied w/ over managing aspects of Gulf Oil disaster to do as much damage in the Gulf as possible.7
8479 2018-01-15 02:06:39 Your fire department friends say….”Put oil fires out by covering them to shut off the oxygen, Not to blow the fire everywhere with an extinguisher!"
8480 2018-01-15 02:06:35 It might be the palm oil. Nowadays, I see where the country of manufacture.
8481 2018-01-15 02:06:31 This thread clearly proves otherwise. There is no peanut oil in vaccines. It was tested as an adjuvant 50+ years ago, but never used.
8482 2018-01-15 02:06:20 got you. i watched a video on this the other day and was skeptical but took some notes. my hydrating cleanser and moisturizer alone have regulated my oil production tremendously.
8483 2018-01-15 02:06:02 naked twister with oil sounds like literally the least sexy thing, and a recipe for multiple broken bones tbh
8484 2018-01-15 02:05:34 Dude her post was my inspiration. Ive been trying to find something good to use this oil in!  lol it would be so perfect and delicious!
8485 2018-01-15 02:04:30 Warren Buffett has a big position in RailRoad ownership. When Hillary and company nixed the Keystone pipeline guess how the Oil had to travel?  .. Right... by Rail.
8486 2018-01-15 02:04:28 You want the oil, but we in LA and Texas have to pay the price. Screw You
8487 2018-01-15 02:04:20 起きた
8488 2018-01-15 02:04:16 is this when you put oil on your face then wash that off with a hydrating cleanser?
8489 2018-01-15 02:04:13 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
8490 2018-01-15 02:03:35 Like, where are the studies trying to replicate anecdotal cancer killing stories, where the general rule is take 1gm or more of hi thc oil per day til cancer goes?
Don't say it doesn't work til you've at least trialled exactly what some patients say does work for them!

8500 2018-01-15 02:01:26 Yes honey! Bake them for 25 minutes at 400 depending on how hot your oven gets (maybe a little less if it gets super hot.) I move them around half way through! A lil olive oil and salt does the trick
8501 2018-01-15 02:01:08 And oil is so great because?
8502 2018-01-15 02:01:00 YUP. The rose hip oil is a real game-changer. (I've also used multiple brands, it's all worked.)

8513 2018-01-15 01:56:48 If you add oil and salt to anything, it’s delicious!!

short Euro or buy dollar, ready or almost ready
SPX/tech extended, a small short may work

8528 2018-01-15 01:54:53 I KNOW I am not the only one wondering why Cynthia and NeNe are all lathered up with oil in their confessionals...  #RHOA
8529 2018-01-15 01:54:52 Putting oil in your bath is real lit. My skin soft as hell.
8530 2018-01-15 01:54:49 Oregano oil. It sucks but helpful. And dissolvable zinc tablets but idk if you can do that with the baby.
8531 2018-01-15 01:54:36 กินยาคลายกล้ามเนื้อก็หายปวดอยู่หรอกพอยาหมดฤทธิเท่านั้นแหละก็ปวดเหมือนเดิม 
8532 2018-01-15 01:54:27 If you have no oil left, but you have a king or queen on board, can you dip their previously anointed heads in the water for the same effect?
8533 2018-01-15 01:54:21 Had an amazing day. Walked to Granville Island for lunch & spent the day outside. Then made raw carrot cake protein balls as well as coconut & lemon balls.

8538 2018-01-15 01:53:17 The situation in Brazil is worse, but receives none of the negative coverage, but both countries are suffering from economic issues that are caused by accumulated capitol and corruption.

Venezuela sitting on oil has nothing to do with the negetive coverage I'm sure.
8539 2018-01-15 01:53:10 Damnit lol - it was....I knew what he tried to do. It was just ridiculous and the worst possible outcome. Like using oil to drown a roach on a lit stove

8547 2018-01-15 01:51:31 As long as you remembered the cheese, you are WINNING.  Because if that had been me, I would have left with an oil diffuser, a cardigan, hand lotion, and maybe a lip balm... but NO cheese. 
8548 2018-01-15 01:51:20 So me and dad change my cars oil for the first time since I bought it and come to find that nice have been living in my car..... SIIIIIIIIIIIIICK 
8549 2018-01-15 01:51:18 A diet is like waiting to change your cars oil until you start to hear it break down. "Im out of breath after two steps?  Now I need a diet"
8550 2018-01-15 01:51:15 Tea tree oil

8554 2018-01-15 01:50:56 It's such a complicated way that nice pans have to be cared for like you have to oil them and bake them over and over and I never do it and if you use soap they're ruined or cook eggs too long they're ruined or etc and you have to start over seasoning lol
8555 2018-01-15 01:50:44 @MannyMua733 try one of the Rimmel primers, @KathleenLights1 and @NikkiaJoyy use them the Matte one for oil skin and he hydrating one for dry skin! THEY ARE SUCH GOOD PRIMERSSSS
8556 2018-01-15 01:50:41 The one that was created when the Oil Sheikhs took over the club in 2008, mind you we've still won more league titles since even then !
8557 2018-01-15 01:50:37 I love doing oil washes!
8558 2018-01-15 01:50:33 I highly recommend it if you can find (or make) the space! I love it because it uses less oil than I would use if I cooked things in the oven so I feel like my fries are relatively “healthy”, lol.
8559 2018-01-15 01:50:23 You can wash it as long as you re-oil. We usually put in coarse salt and scrub with a soap-water rag, then once it’s dry use a paper towel to rub about 1 tsp-1 Tbsp (depending on pan) of oil back into it.
8560 2018-01-15 01:49:45 Hopefully but at this stage I just want them to go away. They are nothing but hucksters trying to sell fish oil.

8566 2018-01-15 01:48:51 @SteveMadden hello!  I was wondering if you’d ever consider bringing back the ‘Powered’ boots?  They were awesome.  My grey ones got an oil stain on them but I still wear them.  They’ve got staying power.

8568 2018-01-15 01:48:50 I’ve been putting Argan oil on my dog and omg he’s so silky smooth as if he wasn’t already perfect
8569 2018-01-15 01:48:43 It's a normal thing in Indonesia when we caught a cold, we have someone scraping our back with herbal oil / balm using a coin. We believe it's the right way to get the "wind" out of the body. Just google "kerokan" :)
8570 2018-01-15 01:48:23 CBD oil helps with anxiety that's probably why. Have you thought about seeing a doctor?
8571 2018-01-15 01:48:14 I don’t give a shit about the Argan oil it costs me 90p I do however care about my bed head shampoo and conditioner which is expensive and makes my hair cute and silky smooth :(
8572 2018-01-15 01:48:14 We don't have to imagine, just look at some of the previous oil spills. It shouldn't be allowed along any states coastline.
8573 2018-01-15 01:48:02 Bitch i wanna see some art!! I wanna analyze that use of color!!! Lick an oil painting!!!!!!
8574 2018-01-15 01:47:56 Obv I don’t know your health history, but it’s important not to cut out all fat. Do you incorporate things like nuts or avocado? I dont use coconut oil anymore, less butter. I’m only using oils that stay liquid at room temp. Less red meat, and less processed foods.
8575 2018-01-15 01:47:54 Interesting piece not that I agree with it all. One note tomorrow supposedly China will start trading with Russia oil for Yuan backed by Gold. Talk about the new world order! This has my attention more than anything and could start a trade war alone.
8576 2018-01-15 01:47:52 Is it for his meds? My cats LOVE coconut oil, I have to hide it so they don’t constantly beg
8577 2018-01-15 01:47:51 sudah tida kepengen lg dengan grapeseed oil, almond oil, rosehip oil, blablabla oil, sabodooooo gamau purging lagi
8578 2018-01-15 01:47:34 W/o a carrier oil vaccines will not remain stable. They will spoil. There has to be a carrier oil in vaccines to make them shelf stable. Every country uses a different carrier oil, depending on what is the most cheaply manufactured in that nation. In Israel they use sesame oil
8579 2018-01-15 01:47:25 And where will this energy come from? Coal, nuclear, oil,natural gas, windmills, sea  tides, solar panels! Someone will bitch or complain about one or all of these!

8583 2018-01-15 01:47:03 It's pretty amusing! The brash confidence based on some limited understanding! Well, we live in a world where data is the new oil and people skid on it from time to time, I guess :)

8605 2018-01-15 01:42:38 Things are considerably better with the aid of cannabis, #kratom, and now hemp oil gummy bears. I have an appt on Feb 5 w/a Pain Dr who I feel hopeful about treating me. I’m D/C’ing use of the cannabis until then so that there’s no possibility of issues w/any urinanalysis.

And it's nice to be able to trade with another place for goods that are made in greater quantity from someone else. It's nice to work with neighbors, fairly.

1) Gather preferred bread, granulated garlic or garlic salt, and any spreadable butter with oil. (I use Challenge Butter with Canola)

2) Preheat a frying pan. Spread butter on both sides while you wait.

8683 2018-01-15 01:28:27 We appreciate you letting us know, Jenny. Based on your video, it seems the oil that helps the topping harden on ice cream, separated out. This can happen if it's in a cold place for a bit too long before reaching store shelves. So we can help further, shoot us a DM.
8684 2018-01-15 01:28:19 I’m not good at sauces and stuff but it really came out good. I used hemp oil in it and grape seed cause hemp oil is really fatty and rich also expensive lol
8685 2018-01-15 01:28:07 Bitter cold night in New England.  @isonewengland data shows electric grid is currently (8:30 pm EST) being powered by 39% nat gas, 29% nuclear, 12% oil, 7% coal, 6% hydro, 3.5% wood, 2.5% refuse, and 2% wind.
8686 2018-01-15 01:27:58 Speaking of conflicts of interest, how is that possible you’re  conservative & “non partisan” when you’re funded by the Koch Oil Industries, (the top 1% and Republican donor)?  You’re certainly NOT non partisan when it comes to the Democrats and the Clintons

8687 2018-01-15 01:27:36 He smiled, "I don't need anything right now. I'll just get this oil so you're well stocked." He put a hand to his chin, holding the bottles of oil. "What should we do now?"
8688 2018-01-15 01:26:51 It probably does need an oil change. You’re supposed to do that every 4K miles.

8707 2018-01-15 01:23:31 You can do it. Make sure you got a good leave in conditioner, some type of oil, and a cream. It really doesn't matter how you twist it as long as it's moisturized properly.

8729 2018-01-15 01:19:52 I think we had our national interest to vote against Israel. 
If we hadn't, the already over-sentimental Arab countries would've become even more emotional about Palestine (being a fellow Islamic people) and might have stopped oil supply to us.

8740 2018-01-15 01:18:04 Ang olive oil, I’m waiting. 
8741 2018-01-15 01:18:04 Mineral oil. It’s synthetic, doesn’t go rancid, fine for human consumption, and uniform across one brand. Other oils may get tacky overtime.
8742 2018-01-15 01:17:42 this one time we tried to cook bacon without cooking oil because she was all “u don’t use oil” and it failed epically but I ate the bacon anyway so she didn’t find out she was awful at cooking
8743 2018-01-15 01:17:27 Still can't come to grips with the fact that there's a real life guy really named T. Boone Pickens and he's a real life oil baron and not a fictional cartoon character.

Sometimes it keeps me up at night.

8751 2018-01-15 01:16:05 Finally done. Oil change and tune up done. I’m tired.  Wanted to stream but sleep.
8752 2018-01-15 01:15:59 The State Dept measured upstream emissions on KXL in 2015 and passed with flying colours. With new GHG emission reduction regs for oil sands, upstream assessments are a minor issue. Read my column tomorrow, Morton is dead wrong. Again. Constitutional scholars say so.
8753 2018-01-15 01:15:42 I got an oil diffuser for my room and I can feel myself becoming a more annoying person
8754 2018-01-15 01:15:22 Low oil prices should keep their military expansion in check too. Drill in ANWR and off shore?
8755 2018-01-15 01:15:19 I need to do a hot oil treatment.
8756 2018-01-15 01:15:09 Wrong Vincent.
Texas is a nice deep Red State.
We are self sustainable. We have lots of oil, farms, ranches and the gulf for fish and trade. We have a very low unemployment rate. A low cost of living. Research before spouting off boy.

8762 2018-01-15 01:13:54 Erdogan was instrumental for letting jihadis cross the border, supply of weapons, training etc., looting of Aleppo and buying oil from IS. How much did his son and his other underlings earn from this?
8763 2018-01-15 01:13:49 States that don't produce oil from offshore drilling shouldn't get to use it. Via your train of thought. And since it now affects you directly in a negative way you're against it aren't you?
8764 2018-01-15 01:13:34 Hi Johnny all well thanks, hope all good with you too, just wanted to know if these brushes work as well in water based as they do in oil,could be an expensive brush to destroy.

8766 2018-01-15 01:13:25 Actually Putin is a brilliant tactician! The globalist hate him cause he took his oil and gas money paid off the central bankers (Rothchilds) and kicked them all out. Hence the hateful rants on Putin cause the globalist Cabal hates him.
8767 2018-01-15 01:13:22 Rex Tillerson, the nation's top diplomat, is clueless to all but oil interests.
8768 2018-01-15 01:13:09 What app y’all be using to make your face look like an oil painting? Stop.
8769 2018-01-15 01:13:08 Yes, America first! That is why we need more oil refineries. None built in more than 30 years.
8770 2018-01-15 01:13:06 OGX coconut oil dry shampoo. It smells heavenly and makes your hair so soft and clean feeling. I swear I will never use anything else
8771 2018-01-15 01:13:05 I think there's a layer of oil on the water surface but idk where is it from ugh

8777 2018-01-15 01:12:22 Rub baby oil on him
8778 2018-01-15 01:12:11 Thank You. I thought about trying that CBD oil stuff for her, but getting conflicting replies from other pet owners about it working.
8779 2018-01-15 01:12:08 Also, the macadamia brand hair mask and coconut oil really really really hydrated my ends
8780 2018-01-15 01:11:36 Maybe some states prefer to have their beaches, which bring in tourist dollars that also support jobs, continue to be clean and unsullied by oil from leaks and explosions. Do you not remember the BP disaster in the Gulf?

8784 2018-01-15 01:10:59 Is it just oil or any thing else?
8785 2018-01-15 01:10:57 rosehip seed oil is amazing. i also really recommend witch hazel as a toner!

8789 2018-01-15 01:10:11 But I'm no expert on frying, so I'll defer to your wisdom here. The take-away I got from both papers you kindly linked, however, is that both EVOO and refined olive oil perform about the same - all better than seed oils anyway.
8790 2018-01-15 01:10:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this January? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.

8792 2018-01-15 01:09:50 My dad bought me some off brand oil and bought my sister and himself some Castrol oil.....I feel it
8793 2018-01-15 01:09:39 Fast Fashion is the second dirtiest industry, next to big oil.
8794 2018-01-15 01:09:29 Gotta get an oil change Tuesday 
8795 2018-01-15 01:08:45 Want? They are probably already finished building the pipelines that will move the oil to refineries. WOW! That a lot of oil! Fracking. Shale oil. Technology. Profits multiplied. Are they paying taxes on this production? If, yes, I hope the schools get some.
8796 2018-01-15 01:08:43 Sebastian Schornack (@dromius) has an extensive pipeline including manual curation for predicting secreted proteins and candidate effectors from the Oil Palm Bud Rot Pathogen, Phytophthora palmivora #PAGXXVI
8797 2018-01-15 01:08:29 I'm with you regarding the safety of EVOO for cooking, indeed the AOX necessarily help protect against oxidation. But neither paper discusses much the taste differences in frying with EVOO vs refined olive oil. In my experience, the former tastes more bitter after frying.
8798 2018-01-15 01:08:28 Thank you for trying to prevent oil drilling off our coasts

8800 2018-01-15 01:08:21 And your body cannot tell the difference between The carrier oil and the actual disease. It sees no difference between peanuts and measles. Goes to attack the invader, as our bodies are supposed to do. That is why there is such a huge jump in the incidence of peanut allergies
8801 2018-01-15 01:08:19 Google it  
I think its olive oil, or sesame oil, or coconut oil that soften the hair?
An oil that is.
8802 2018-01-15 01:08:06 Seems fair. Anyone really wanting a deal would not publically disparage the person your working with. Whether he said it or not. Sabotage
8803 2018-01-15 01:07:57 I filled up my gas tank, got an oil change, vacuumed and washed my car all in one day. Who am I
8804 2018-01-15 01:07:35 There’s a fairly obvious answer to that when you look where Trump has business interests. Wouldn’t want all those entitled 1%’s having to look at some unseemly offshore oil rig. 
8805 2018-01-15 01:07:30 Also don't use essential oil diffusers if you, suffer from hayfever, have dry or sensitive skin, have asthma, have young children or elder relatives living with you, have aquatic pets in the same room as the diffusers and extended use can damage the lining of your eyes and lungs.
8806 2018-01-15 01:06:45 Kind of ironic how a player is more willing to go to United because of money as opposed to an "oil team" who are actually going to win trophies this season 
8807 2018-01-15 01:06:38 despite cooking dinner ~nightly for years i am still unable to put something into boiling water/oil without doing at least 2 of the following:

-somersaults ft. skips 'n jumps
-yelping
-food Hits the Floor
8808 2018-01-15 01:06:26 The funny part of this is McCarthy represents CA-23. A district I refer to as the “armpit of CA”.

8811 2018-01-15 01:06:00 I was like "is that guy naked?" and then I paid attention and read that it read Michael Nakazawa and realized that obviously he's naked. And covered in oil and dirt.

8813 2018-01-15 01:05:52 Wow just Wow... who is paying u for this? We all know why some players choose city over united over the last 10 years..oil money? Get a life..and stop being so loaded that ur beloved team didn’t get who they really wanted
8814 2018-01-15 01:05:49 It has to do with your allergy receptors. IGe and iGg if I remember correctly.  The way vaccines work is that they mount a huge immune response against what the body perceives as a foreign invader.  The carrier oil is bound to the actual disease....
8815 2018-01-15 01:05:40 I got this oil stuff that helps your hair grow thicker and stronger guess who's gonna have some THICC BROWS ON FLEEK
8816 2018-01-15 01:05:34 All a bunch of politics ! The oil companies will not invest billions into any offshore areas that has such opposition and law suits ! They have proven reserves to produce !

8820 2018-01-15 01:04:51 The sinking of the collision damaged and burning Panama Flag tanker ‘Sanchi’ on Sunday 14 Jan 2018  which was carrying 136,000 tonnes of Iranian light crude oil bound for South Korea – with a loss of 32 seafarer lives is likely to result in another environmental catastrophe
8821 2018-01-15 01:04:40 Okay THIS I agree with entirely. So let’s say that. More support for infrastructure is needed. But let’s say that within the context of all the factors that effect the price of Alberta oil.
8822 2018-01-15 01:04:39 I wasn't taught how to change my oil in math class. Good for you!

8830 2018-01-15 01:02:36 There’s many more than just these... (lavender oil, sage oil, etc.) nearly all essential oils are toxic to cats. It’s better to just be safe and not use any.
8831 2018-01-15 01:02:30 can u tweet more
8832 2018-01-15 01:02:24 Yeah.  the good guy who planted WMD story yup assassinate HOS so they get control over the country to ensure oil supply

8835 2018-01-15 01:02:17 My current kit: a quick rub of jojoba oil and nothing else. It was so perfect when I got it that it didn’t need anything else. I use jojoba specifically because it mimics the oils on skin, very few people are allergic, and it doesn’t go rancid.

8861 2018-01-15 00:58:48 "Oil? Sure." He stood up and went to the shop to browse the items, "Ah, Oil. Here we go, anything else?" He looked back to him.
8862 2018-01-15 00:58:43 I dislike most dairy a lot but some foods super high in fat or oil (like peanut butter) can't be cleansed from my palate effectively with water so I'm forced to turn to milk. 

So picture this, me, reluctantly downing a glass of milk like a shot.
8863 2018-01-15 00:58:43 China big appetite. They gobble up almost everything. From oil, iron ore, coal, soybean to copper. Due to the measures against pollution, the local productions are reduced, import numbers have risen to narrow the output gap.

8875 2018-01-15 00:57:38 If you have them, take a hot bath with epsom salts and lavender oil and ginger. That'll help. If you do yoga, I can give you some stretches to do. Let me know if it's upper or lower back. Hugs (gently).
8876 2018-01-15 00:57:25 @guarnaschelli I have a recipe for roasted chicken with butter and truffle oil under the skin before the fridge for 24 hours. I have never used truffle oil and I am seeing black and white oils. Any advice, please. Thank you.

8881 2018-01-15 00:56:48 Sprinkled lavender oil on my duvet so I could sleep quicker but I’ve managed to do it so it’s all I can smell at all and now I’m too distracted to sleep. Well done Zainab 
8882 2018-01-15 00:56:34 It actually is.  All it takes is discipline.  Easier to sell snake oil, I guess.
8883 2018-01-15 00:56:27 And in '94 Clinton bragged that he could get a half million tons of oil as aide to N Korea  and they would stop their nuclear program.  How easily was President Clinton duped on that?  History now not kind to either of the Clintons.  Thank God for Pres. Trump in control.  #MAGA
8884 2018-01-15 00:56:27 Yuppers, but you can take your own plastic and turn it back into oil, then into gasoline for yourself.. been doing this for a while at the farm
8885 2018-01-15 00:56:17 I would have come home with cheese + five more things, and none of them as awesome as an essential oil diffuser, so I'm impressed.
8886 2018-01-15 00:56:13 About to try this coconut oil pulling for a week starting today & we gone see if it’s really good for teeth cause It got my face beautifully radiant.

8894 2018-01-15 00:54:49 My main issue with @PParseyan’s tweet is he uses “we” like it’s somehow the gov’t fault that our oil is worth less. It isn’t about Alberta being taken advantage of. But Markham can explain this far better than I.

8901 2018-01-15 00:52:58 It’s good that you know where the gas cap is and can remove and replace it. Now you need to check the engine’s oil using the oil stick!!
8902 2018-01-15 00:52:54 Trump is a horses ass (I apologize to horses) and frankly daft and should be impeached and convicted. He has no clue what he’s doing. Clearly now the REPUBLICAN VILLAGE IDIOT! Drill for oil everywhere but Florida? Fossil Fuel? How about OLD FOSSIL LOGIC?
8903 2018-01-15 00:52:44 I need to look up that marula oil. 
8904 2018-01-15 00:52:09 I comb it and have oil. It smells good but it's all up in my sense of smell. Haha
8905 2018-01-15 00:51:53 Value guys push value. Momo guys push momo names. Oil guys push oil. Once you eliminate the bias of the person is it still a great investment ?
8906 2018-01-15 00:51:50 And the world, trade, labor, general economies are exactly like 1800, 1980? Yours is a simplistic view. We're not the same neither are needs

8925 2018-01-15 00:47:30 It's also interesting the mayor of NYC gets around in an SUV and is opposed to road tolls and congestion pricing. Suing oil companies is nice but how about taking more steps to stop using their product?
8926 2018-01-15 00:47:27 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

Obama championed fracking, as Hillary did as his Secretary of State. He opened up oil drilling in the Arctic twice

Obama did nothing real to fight climate change

9031 2018-01-15 00:32:17 This guy marches against oil companies. Doesn't seem to know much about them, or the contributions they've made to society... but... yeah... let's hear it for the useful idiots. Little conjecture to wind them up and watch them go. Big win for foreign oil and the oil tanker biz.

9035 2018-01-15 00:31:24 Nice fantasy. But as resources are consumed it becomes harder and harder to grow. This is why peak oil is such a problem and that's neglecting the environmental problems from such growth.

9066 2018-01-15 00:26:36 We allowed Danny to blow $26 billion in one time new rev! We need to limit the amt any gov can use of oil royalties and face reality.

9067 2018-01-15 00:26:33 The environmentalists have villianised  the oil sands to the point where we are an easy target and then overlook those other countries who are not doing as much as we are. Double standard.

9077 2018-01-15 00:24:30 Fun fact for those that recycle and believe its good to do. When dumping occurs it's not worth the time for recyclers to bother with. Into the land fill it goes. More oil, gas and coal are used to turn dirt into metal. Bad for Mother Earth.
9078 2018-01-15 00:24:15 Of course! Also, a wee bit of oil, a little iodized salt & a little fake salt for potassium. Plus bone meal.

9096 2018-01-15 00:20:59 That Fla received an extension to offshore drilling is because trump has coastal property.  This attests that he (and the GOP) is fully aware of the hazards & simply doesn't want those hazards around his property. He wants to appease Big Oil so he forces drilling on other states.

9110 2018-01-15 00:18:37 I think they stopped making it because the ingredients can be expensive. But this cocotion I discovered can get rid of any cold or flu very quickly.

9122 2018-01-15 00:17:04 Ok, I get that. But how does cheap oil win votes? From whom? For whom? And even if such a (somewhat dubious) rationale applied in the past, does it still apply *now*, especially given that the US has been putting so much effort into becoming a major oil *exporter* once again?
9123 2018-01-15 00:17:01 it should be vigorously explored.  Generally speaking it is hemp seed oil that seems most promising.  As far as I know, which is grantedly not spectacular.

9158 2018-01-15 00:12:24 Rice it is and just have to wait on the modified chili to heat up to cover it with. Rice gets toasted in saucepan in coconut oil, again. Butter burns too easily. Just to where the rice starts to tan evenly mixing occasionally. Once there I add the water and cook as usual.
9159 2018-01-15 00:12:23 Man i just hooked up some ramen noodles, even made a chilli pepper quick hot oil
9160 2018-01-15 00:12:21 I like Rogers better as a building but atmosphere and production is lights out a T-mobile Arena. Closest thing to a playoff feel Oil fans will see this year. Intro gave me goosebumps.
9161 2018-01-15 00:12:15 Mixture of honey, olive oil, sugar, Apple cider vinegar and baking soda.   It feels very soft.
9162 2018-01-15 00:12:04 I feel your pain. But, because of Coldpocalypse 2018, I've discovered a new use for Rose Hip Oil: dab a little around your nose to soothe that Kleenex-irritated skin. It's a wonder! Feel better!
9163 2018-01-15 00:11:25 シリコンガンとシリコンはなぁ
レジ袋に入れると穴空くわ。重いわでレジ袋に入れたくない商品5位ぐらいだったわ。
9164 2018-01-15 00:11:21 Baking soda, lemon essential oil and vinegar
9165 2018-01-15 00:11:11 oh okay my dumbass has been doing that much

i've really just not been using nearly enough oil on it
9166 2018-01-15 00:10:53 Three of our suppliers, Sunoco, Inc. (18%), Dominion Transmission Inc. (12%) and ExxonMobil Oil Corp. (11%), accounted for approximately 41% of propane purchases during fiscal 2004.
9167 2018-01-15 00:10:40 sooo embarrassed to be stuffing my face with trader joe’s olive oil popcorn in the walmart/tj maxx/bed bath and beyond vestibule!!!
9168 2018-01-15 00:10:29 It doesn’t work at all as a lube people just think it does dollar store penetrating oil works better or even better PB Blaster which is a penetrant and lubricant
9169 2018-01-15 00:10:25 @BurgerKing the fucking ice cream machine in Oxfords broken. We had to go to @McDonalds and it tasted oil. Love you guys but I know if I was in the US @Wendys would've done me better.
9170 2018-01-15 00:10:22 and had other artists accidentally slip on music stages from the oil*
9171 2018-01-15 00:10:18 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
9172 2018-01-15 00:10:15 OIL DIFF: 5.62 -> 5.69
9173 2018-01-15 00:10:15 How come Trump isn’t calling out Putin for him increasing the oil supply to NK
9174 2018-01-15 00:10:10 @garnierUSA I love your #wholeblends coconut oil and shea butter leave-in conditioner I use it daily : )
9175 2018-01-15 00:10:10 What are your thoughts on oil
9176 2018-01-15 00:10:08 Bull shit. We will have more power if we join the EU. England only interested in oil revenues, whisky and fishing grounds. The later will be traded off to keep London’s bankers onside.
9177 2018-01-15 00:10:04 All those oil fields and more than 52 food banks in Scotland and nearly 50,000 children supported with 3 day foodparcels in the last year.  #WhatsWrongWithThisPicture?
9178 2018-01-15 00:09:48 That's the thing, I had a 2014 Doge Caliber and 15 Durango and both gave me problems and before buying them off the lot they forgot to tell me that there is no transmission dipstick and I had to pay $65 just to make sure my oil not low each visit.
9179 2018-01-15 00:09:39 I’m praying to see a difference in my hair growth in at least 3-6 months with all these vitamins and coconut oil treatments 
9180 2018-01-15 00:09:22 RT danny__miami: Israel is developing cannabis oil in tab/paper form so you just put it under your tongue and you feel the effects a couple seconds later
9181 2018-01-15 00:09:21 Only thing I’m missing is a new facial oil
9182 2018-01-15 00:09:10 @Breezin12 ~ ~  " There's  a  Body  that  needs  plenty  of  oil  and  quite  a  bit  of  attention !!!!! "  I Love Her!!!!
9183 2018-01-15 00:08:52 The world is NOT about Oil,, Its about Debt Slavery. Look it up.
9184 2018-01-15 00:08:37 네!! 막콘때 뵈요
9185 2018-01-15 00:08:25 @heraldsun Blazing tanker sinks. A Iranian oil tanker ignited off Shanghai's coast as flames raged with smoke rising 1,000 metres into the air. The tanker then sunk, this eight days after it collided with a freight ship in China's seas. No hope of survival for 30 missing crewmen.
9186 2018-01-15 00:08:11 Burnt myself with tea tree oil. Man I learned my lesson.
9187 2018-01-15 00:07:49 Sometimes two separate things which are good on their own, do not mix well.

~You were the oil to my water
9188 2018-01-15 00:07:46 @OhItsTeddy can you show us your olive oil and balsamic vinegar collection?
9189 2018-01-15 00:07:43 I need some vegetable oil though but I don’t feel like going to the grocery store

9193 2018-01-15 00:06:39 Terrance Newman’s hips need oil. Geez Michael Thomas broke him off
9194 2018-01-15 00:06:34 Haha! Tea Tree oil for great skin too! Really!! Thanks for the compliment
9195 2018-01-15 00:06:19 And oil....don't forget that.
9196 2018-01-15 00:05:55 More like 80W 90 hypoid gear oil.
9197 2018-01-15 00:05:46 After using trying out a lot of face creams that don't do nothing extra, I stay using a mixture of good old shea butter&coconut oil on my body&face. My face loves it so++
9198 2018-01-15 00:05:42 I like Brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, broiled. I can live without carrots either way
9199 2018-01-15 00:05:31 He only cares about oil spills where it may affect him financially. He doesn’t care about the environment or clean water. He’ll afford his clean bottled water and have his Puerto Rican servant scrub his golden toilet... and probably wipes his ass too, even though he is capable...
9200 2018-01-15 00:05:27 It can, but be prepared to take a lot of it....might cause irritability at first, but it's worth a try.  I took it for a while when my Raynaud's would flare up.  better than the alternative of calcium channel blockers.  Oh, I took, it with high grams of EPA from fish oil too
9201 2018-01-15 00:05:21 It's cold enough here to freeze oil in the pipelines
9202 2018-01-15 00:05:14 EA Shea butter? Got this Slice of naturals joint from Amazon. Coconut oil, Nutiva.
9203 2018-01-15 00:05:03 Akhir mg lalu Dow naik +228,46 (+0,89%) di 25.803. S&P500 naik +18,68 poin (+0,67%) di 2.786. Oil di 64,31 dan Emas di 1337
9204 2018-01-15 00:05:00 2 weeks into 2018 & I've had this happen:
-mom in hospital 
-wifes car broke down (twice)
-lost heat when it was negative degrees outside
-my boiler pour a TON of oil all over my laundry rm.
Nothing as bad as today...when my dad saw a "toy " left in our bathroom. #shutitdown2018

9207 2018-01-15 00:04:16 I use Peppermint Halo. Essential oil on my hairline. I can’t do OTC pain relievers. Also, a heated lavender bag on my shoulders.
9208 2018-01-15 00:04:13 The most LA thing about me: I put CBD oil in my ~morning tonic~  The least LA thing about me: I enjoy walking.
9209 2018-01-15 00:04:09 Maybe the oil sheikhs will sell them and we’ll go back to not knowing they exist again.
9210 2018-01-15 00:03:56 By that logic every landlocked state shouldn't use oil from off shore drilling too.
9211 2018-01-15 00:03:54 Forget the butter, use olive oil.
9212 2018-01-15 00:03:43 pake oil based dong, jadi tinggal disisir lagi kinclong lagi :p

9219 2018-01-15 00:02:39 I never thought of that aspect re: oil prices. Interesting. Courtois Christensen azpi hazard kante. That's all we have. The rest are either deadwood/declining or don't belong at all (drinkwater, zappcosta) we have promising youth but manager never gives them first team run

9227 2018-01-15 00:01:14 See how you like the next Alaskan oil spill with no EPA to clean it up.
9228 2018-01-15 00:01:05 2 weeks on 2 weeks off,, flown out by Helicopter to the oil derricks
9229 2018-01-15 00:01:04 Hey everyone I just made the best cous cous (yeah I know, bare with) ever!

9230 2018-01-15 00:00:46 Combine 1/3 cup cake with 1/3 cup beer. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve over kale.
9231 2018-01-15 00:00:43 Piers why do you  keep on ? everyone knows wenger will never be sacked! Don’t worry mate only 2 years to wait  #Wenger #Arsenal
9232 2018-01-15 00:00:40 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
9233 2018-01-15 00:00:34 The Venezuelan government is launching its own version of cryptocurrency (the Petro) tied to the value of its oil reserves.  Overall it looks like a sham and a way for the government to capitalize on crypto hype while maintaining its high level of corruption and inefficiency
9234 2018-01-15 00:00:34 A massage with baby oil won’t heal a sore back but it will make you pregnant  it’s magic!
9235 2018-01-15 00:00:14 Before they start drilling for oil?
9236 2018-01-15 00:00:10 I used to live in Vancouver and work on the oil fields in Alberta
9237 2018-01-15 00:00:10 South Oil Co., Iraqi Shipping Company, & Arab Gulf Academy for Maritime Studies hv marine resources but not sure if equipped to do this. They should be though. SOC fire fighters were instrumental in putting down fires in Baiji/Qayyara. Hoping for the best.
9238 2018-01-15 00:00:01 Guess who burnt her finger today by accidentally sticking it in hot fryer oil me it was me
