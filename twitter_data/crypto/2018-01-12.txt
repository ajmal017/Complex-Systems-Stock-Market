1 2018-01-13 23:59:45 There are "those" people in every crypto community. Unfortunate, but it's all over the place, whether BTC, ETH, (whispers) BCash, Ripple, etc
2 2018-01-13 23:59:32 yes, better for noobs to wait but I don't mind throwing a few hundred bucks to try it out and be at the cutting edge of scaling btc. Someone has to do it. lol

6 2018-01-13 23:58:57 There are "options", re: bitcoin's "energy problem", whether they will implement them is another story. There is "proof-of-stake", rather than bitcoin's "proof-of-work" (mining), other cryptos already use this method. I think crypto, in one form or another is, "here to stay" tho

12 2018-01-13 23:57:55 Crypto Is just a money game right now until it can be backed by a government to legitimize it. Otherwise, we're just bartering virtual numbers for fiat.

16 2018-01-13 23:57:26 Welkom in het wilde westen Vd crypto wereld. Vergeet niet dat alles wat hard stijgt ook hard kan dalen en dat er ook veel oplichters en dieven rondlopen, opletten en vragen blijft geboden.
17 2018-01-13 23:57:16 Doesn't sound accurate coming from a person who has had crypto success. Honestly it sounds like a cry for help to put his concerns to rest.

19 2018-01-14 23:59:56 @nova_exchange just announced that they will no longer be closing. This is great news for crypto investors everywhere. It's especially good news for #GCoin investors. @nova_exchange deposit wallets are currently disabled, but once deposits are allowed, you will be able to start

27 2018-01-14 23:59:40 Current conditions of the market is troubling. It is not showing growth, intense manipulation and lack of patience. This behavior will inhibit the industry’s progression. The purpose of crypto has being forgotten. Greed and manipulation has taken its place.
28 2018-01-14 23:59:39 Selling all my $crypto bags right now would double my $BTC value. It’s very tempting but the fomo of missing out on the inevitable 10x pumps coming up in the next few weeks would be unbearable. What to do?
29 2018-01-14 23:59:22 #Ethereum market cap now 57% of #bitcoin, and the gap is narrowing rapidly. There will be soon be a new king of the hill in the #cryptocurrency world.

31 2018-01-14 23:59:19 The benefit is the same as with any crypto. Why use BTC? LTC? DASH? B/C you can’t insert coins and bills into a vending slot on your computer. We value XRP for its unique ability to solve a multi trillion dollar problem, supported by a company with an unparalleled track record.

45 2018-01-12 23:59:19 I wouldn’t say you are wrong I was only messing around. It is Crypto and anything could happen. Charts show a dump a few years ago. A new team can sure bring something alive. Interesting to watch
46 2018-01-12 23:59:15 Yeah and im saying those codes arent written by litecoin devs. They didnt develop LN or segwit. Bitcoin devs did all that and gave it to Charlie Lee to do some testing on the litecoin network as a testbed to make sure its safe for bitcoin.

Thanks in advance!
52 2018-01-12 23:58:33 Bitcoin is the best store of value (lack of governance and first mover advantage - gold like, but better). Ripple is an awesome utility crypto to move whatever you want really fucking fast without borders.
