5 2018-09-15 23:54:57 You say clean the account out like he took money from you. You basically asked him to manage your betting account. When you ask a stocks and shares person to invest your money and they lose it  are they scamming you? It's gambling so always a chance you can lose

Grabi my life decisions rn are like high risk stocks. shit
11 2018-09-15 23:45:05 Given that penny stocks are for speculators, are very easy to manipulate, I do not understand what the SEC was trying to do by widening trading spreads - it is a license to steal by market makers.

14 2018-09-15 23:41:09 this news is less than half the story. another essential part is US investors' are investing heavily in Canadian pot companies. there are of course no border restrictions on them. and if these US border restrictions on Canadians put a damper on Canadians investing cheaper stocks!
15 2018-09-15 23:40:35 @cppinvest interesting stuff. I noticed that the stock moves down on institutional sales but float up otherwise. 
Stocks like $TSLA tend to attract heavy options speculation. Have you considered the impact of that?
Algos and speculators are probably milking tweets and news flow.

42 2018-09-15 23:34:43 Im cost averaging it. Not trading. And also its multiplier is very game changing. And is the only crypto I own. The rest I have in some BR stocks and I choose to concentrate the portfolio in assets that trade below my cost average. Hence the high position dogecoin. Bear made it.

45 2018-09-15 23:31:33 What do you mean good poll numbers.  People hate you so much that Nike stocks are at their highest level ever for siding w/ anthem protests.  Hell they're doing even better than when Tiger woods was their face!
46 2018-09-15 23:31:16 Very useful concepts for group stocks value investing as day & swing traders advance in their careers and start to create a portfolio of stocks in their own 401K accounts (which should be kept separate from their day trading accounts and other investments).
47 2018-09-15 23:30:33 Oui, c'est vrai! La décision française d'hier sur le glyphosate, c'est le moindre mal par rapport au reste de l'Europe...mais néanmoins, c'est quand même toujours un mal, même s'il est moindre. Pourquoi ne pas aller plus vite? Pour permettre à Monsanto d'écouler ses stocks?

50 2018-09-15 23:28:06 Stock wise this would be bad though stocks and crypto are negative related right? So good for Crypto?
51 2018-09-15 23:25:14 Be engaged in operation of getting money NOT ILLEGALLY even though thats what we aquire from being from the hood but in any areas from simple investments in stocks or any sort of investment you believe can succeed in the future. Be ur own boss. Create your own empire.
52 2018-09-15 23:23:13 I think public humiliation with stocks or pillory of Colonial times would be appropriate.
53 2018-09-15 23:22:34 Shit dude, I'm getting tired of all the winning, my taxes got cut giving me more in each paycheck and my stocks and 401K are doing awesome! I paid more in taxes and my stocks were stagnate under BHO. And don't forget, black and Mexican unemployment is at an all time LOW!

60 2018-09-15 23:16:34 I am a Life NRA member. I am not ok with a convicted felon buying a gun!  I am also for common sense gun reform, including banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, & “assault” rifles.  But I would also like to see a way from responsible gun owners to carry in all 50 states.
61 2018-09-15 23:10:44 When you buy Stocks...

TIME is with you, its your friend...
You have only one thing to be correct..Direction.

When you buy Options...
   
TIME is against you, its your enemy 
You have to be right both Direction    and Time ...

See what you are capable of...
62 2018-09-15 23:10:41 if anyone would like to teach me how to invest in stocks that would be greatly appreciated.
63 2018-09-15 23:09:18 Thanks donnie for the great job my stocks are sky high, i can now retire in peace
64 2018-09-15 23:08:24 Nike stocks are up...just sayin
65 2018-09-15 23:07:51 Really? Check the historical economic numbers. In Jan/09, we had a recession, unemployment was 7.9 and millions lost jobs in 2008 & 2009 due to recession left by Bush. When Obama left in Jan/17, unemployment was 4.8, stocks up by 150%, over 12 million net jobs added, etc......
66 2018-09-15 23:03:37 There are many big UK CFD brokers in Singapore and UK but they either do not have the volatile penny stocks ($5 to $20) or only allowed long position or disable the shorting on some of the stocks. CFD is good but brokers' algo at certain hours play against you almost immediately.
67 2018-09-15 23:02:24 I only trade stocks when the spread is thin. I prefer to get executed instantly that’s why I switched to CFDs. Other traders who trade with a normal broker take big size will end up getting partially filled or even worse not being able to locate the shares to short
68 2018-09-15 23:01:41 my mood dropped faster than cube’s stocks
69 2018-09-15 22:58:50 I couldn’t think of a scenario of me ever doing it so why would any institution ahah plus if stocks crash you short 
70 2018-09-15 22:58:09 Ouais, t’as regardé sur le site? Il paraît que le prix a baissé, parce qu’Apple veut écouler les stocks du X.

72 2018-09-15 22:56:54 I now I want to go see if a local shop that stocks UK snacks will get an order of curly wurly.

74 2018-09-15 22:55:19 Nice dude!  Enjoy. Sold mine a few years back and switched to Audi now . Thanks pot stocks indeed lol
75 2018-09-15 22:52:52 Moi je suis allé dans le mediamarkt à coté de chez moi et le gars me l'a donné des stocks donc mhmh
76 2018-09-15 22:52:29 Yup, sad but true. However, there’s still enough time to get one before stocks runs out.
77 2018-09-15 22:49:58 Haha I know, there’s so much young talent there that I find it really interesting. Plus in England we have a thing called Football Index which is basically a stock market where the footballers are the stocks, so I like to find some good players to buy in Ligue 1...
78 2018-09-15 22:46:26 Claramente no viste el grafico de las tech stocks.
79 2018-09-15 22:46:20 I actually hesitated about becoming a barrister because of my worry that the inns may not be able to accommodate my heavy cheese habit. Thank god for the pioneering women who came before us and forced the inns to increase their cheese stocks.
80 2018-09-15 22:45:23 Oh damn! Think it’s time I take a short position on some of these legacy auto stocks
81 2018-09-15 22:43:07 financial intelligence is so attractive like yeah you got a pretty face but do you understand how stocks work???
82 2018-09-15 22:41:33 Well, I don't agree with the death penalty for that, James, but that's the kind of thing that deserves the stocks, or the pillory, where creeps like that can be put "on display" and publicly humiliated. It's been used recently, too.
83 2018-09-15 22:41:05 If you bought Nike stocks amidst the Kaepernick thing, I'd suggest selling them now. The reactionary stock boom is gonna wane and drop the prices down to normal here pretty soon.

Gonna make bank.
84 2018-09-15 22:40:17 He descubierto un trucombo con Canela muy bueno, nada mas empieza la partida, corres directamente a la derexha o izquierda (depende donde aparezcas) y dejate caer asta morir, pero con las dos stocks he? Creedme, vale la pena
85 2018-09-15 22:39:51 I bet I could pick stocks better that you......i have had brokers (investment counselors lol) that admitted they could not pick winning stocks. You are a salesman......
86 2018-09-15 22:35:59 Stocks in Nike are doing pretty damn good I'd say...
87 2018-09-15 22:34:56 j'suis trop le genre d'employé, crari quand y'a plus de croquant M&M's pour les mcflurry j'vais dire aux clients qu'on est en rupture de M&M'S alors qu'en réel j'ai juste la flemme d'aller en chercher dans les stocks
88 2018-09-15 22:34:38 Your Chinese stocks sinking?
89 2018-09-15 22:34:09 For those that don't understand stocks:
Day 1"#Nike loses 2B in stock after #Kaepernick ad"
Day 2: #Nike closes at Record high as stock goes up"
Day 1 consumers voiced their opinion
Day 2 brokers/owners/high power traders/NIKE THEMSELVES reaped the benefit of lower stock price.
90 2018-09-15 22:33:43 Nothing goes up forever!  But good traders will find gains. I like the fact that it isn't just crypto.  Its stocks,  currencies etc. Choices. Sometimes traders can go the wrong way...true.
91 2018-09-15 22:32:40 You know I am not a hater and that I am a  bagholder,  Lt. C. I just have criticism to Charlie Lee's behaviour. Can you imagine that the owner of BMW would sell his stocks at ATH and then start saying Mercedes is the best and that he does not recommend buying a Beemer?
92 2018-09-15 22:32:25 @DBChirpy true when given to middle and poor as it boosts spending and aids the economy. Tax cuts to corporations aids their investors who are not all USA citizens.  Aids buybacks of stocks again not direct to USA economy.
93 2018-09-15 22:31:51 >Most but that's only because over the past few decades I've come to invest in quite a few good stocks and wanted myself a custom mobile home."

94 2018-09-15 22:31:03 Gallant Liberals fired Elise McClary without cause. She was studying Chemicals being used in NB Forests. Now no more  bald eagles, I cross St John River  twice a day and never saw an eagle this year!  JD Irving got their way. A vote for Liberal is a vote to poison Salmon stocks,
95 2018-09-15 22:30:07 Sweet ! I can smell my stocks rising again ! Winning
96 2018-09-15 22:27:58 My local shop stocks @ALTERNACOMICS and they were sold out today.  Their website says Barnes and Noble carries them so I plan to check their tomorrow.

98 2018-09-15 22:27:12 This is assuming he didn’t KNOW he was lying, which he ABSOLUTELY DID.

He checked his facts, then he decided his Halliburton stocks were worth more than innocent lives and chose to lie anyways.
99 2018-09-15 22:26:41 it because simplex works well for him. & know you can find it in “vallarta or el super” stores, but if you would like to DM your address I can send you some. My mom stocks up LOL

107 2018-09-15 22:16:26 They say that @Nike stocks soared after the captaindick endorcement, what they're NOT saying is that stocks soared cause it was the first of the fucking month and welfare checks came out!!! Lets keep it real here  @Nike @nikestore
108 2018-09-15 22:16:17 @DecathlonES la actualización de los stocks y los productos no existentes en la web es un desastre.

109 2018-09-15 22:16:03 Surprised by what? That he has advocated for this since the 90's BEFORE there we stocks? Or the fact that 60% of Americans believe in legalization.  Or the fact that you are are the third party candidate in this race? #nmpol #gary4nm

112 2018-09-15 22:14:00 Media should pack up a bong of this slang never putting out a chemistry list next to the UV of the day. Crap level in the lake for the grandkids going down or the pharmaceutical stocks going up? Why the busy over #cannascience & deep breathing this news report? #ACMPR

119 2018-09-15 22:09:47 That is kind of how stocks work, but take pride in the 82 to 83 jump from CK and thank Trump for the 62 to 82 jump this year
120 2018-09-15 22:08:13 It's all a stupid politics play too

Do we see anyone from Amsterdam being banned?

What about americans who invest in those stocks?

It's dumb all around.

126 2018-09-15 21:56:21 @CoachBrianKelly for the love of god you almost lost to one of the laughing stocks in the SEC!  Throw the ball down field!!  Here’s your offense, run left, run Middle, run right.  You should be embarrassed about last week, and embarrassed about this week.
127 2018-09-15 21:49:44 I know several Prop Traders.Hell, @TylerHKling is my homie and he's ex prop guy that very much thinks like a prop trader.However, its intellectually dishonest to tell ppl that "trading" isn't for them if they aren't trading 5 "in play" stocks a day, w/5 monitors & charts galore.

237 2018-09-15 20:13:16 Tobacco stocks have gone up due to threat of flavor ban. Robber baron Gottlieb, forcing people to go Back to analog cigarettes. This senior citizen will go to jail before I give up my flavors. Kill millions of people, not what fda should be doing. Writing Pres Trump to put stop
238 2018-09-15 20:12:13 It's OK. I've found multipacks on ebay. I'll order and replenish your stocks.
239 2018-09-15 20:11:24 Sure, institutional investors may also set a sell trigger on a single stock, but it is easily amortised over gains made on other stocks in that same basket, especially in the current market. Which is why fund managers spread investments. Which is why people invest in funds.
240 2018-09-15 20:10:45 I don't think they would consider trading stocks like investing. The broader meaning is if you are in the business, or else it would be like it is ok to raid all the US citizens who trade/ traded the sector.

241 2018-09-15 20:09:58 @vladtenev Their simply is nothing more important than giving users the freedom to sell their stocks inside of FINRA regs & to ensure that the consumer can get what they want. In this instance, my future has been ruined. I don't want anybody to feel as low as I do right now.

244 2018-09-15 20:08:07 IMO, it helps to break these things down into positive sum and zero sum (usually neg sum after fees). 

+ sum is stocks, bonds, etc. Things with a defined fundamental cash flow.

- zero sum is gambling, options, insurance, etc. 

+ sum > - sum. But - sum can insure + sum.

268 2018-09-15 19:40:48 Rush to invest and buy on dips.  Although I must say some stocks I bought on dips and held on wiped out most of my losses. Lesson learned - don't/can't time the market.
269 2018-09-15 19:39:52 This is wrong tho
 Picking stocks with coin flips would be a decent extended market index funds, and you could hire monkeys to flip the coin and pay them in bananas.
270 2018-09-15 19:39:22 How was it stagnant? And these tax cuts are translating into companies buying back their stocks to inflate their stocks.
271 2018-09-15 19:39:03 I just list of stocks. Its one of them. No scanner besides my eyes.
272 2018-09-15 19:38:54 $11000 That’s the US dollar amount of American stocks the Swiss National Bank owns on behalf of every man, woman and child in Switzerland. If the Federal Reserve decided to invest $11,589 in the US stock market per American citizen, they would need to buy $3.75 trillion of stocks
273 2018-09-15 19:38:38 I trade stocks and if I do my homework, I still need my name.
274 2018-09-15 19:37:28 exactly! it’s like they went to an old used book store that only stocks old school romance for .25c
275 2018-09-15 19:35:57 Think your wrong
French boats only have the right to fish for scallops from October 1 until May 15 to allow local stocks to regenerate, but UK crews do not face the same restrictions.

282 2018-09-15 19:29:37 I trade based on opportunities, like every investor and trader. Clint, no one is saying anything negative about $NNSR, If the stock bounces it is healthy for #greenZebra's run. All stocks consolidates it is a normal cycle for publicly traded instruments.

All IMO @TradingTeacher
283 2018-09-15 19:28:27 My brother brought stocks up at my bday lunch and I ended up just like screaming about capitalism and consumerism in America and everyone walked away from the table... it’s MY birthday you are REQUIRED to stay and fight w me

289 2018-09-15 19:23:21 And I love love love being there!   So glad I left stupid penny land. Real stocks, real trading, real learning real respect!  The community is awesome too!  I learn tons from them as well.  So excited to be here.  Can't stop me now!
290 2018-09-15 19:22:02 My own two cents? Focus on the stocks. This is a target rich environment 
291 2018-09-15 19:21:09 What many don’t realize about the Chinese tarrifs is that it’s not only about leveling the field of imports exports, & ip theft. It’s going to cause Amazon stocks to PLUMMET as 97% of all goods sold on Amazon come from China. Temporary pain for many Americans but necessary 4 now.
292 2018-09-15 19:16:58 The moment there's an earthquake/tremor on land... Best start looking for the nearest ocean and the nearest financial markets to that ocean and quickly dump insurance stocks.

And buy up stocks of bottle water.
293 2018-09-15 19:16:53 @agurevich23 Your long Nikkei has also been working out very well.  You thinking the Yen gets weaker from here across developed currency pairs?  Also if you're looking for real carry, wouldn't high div US stocks be the best of breed if liquidity is coming into the US markets?
294 2018-09-15 19:12:47 otc coder Have noticed consistent buying in $cype around 50k shares daily avg. since suspendion in the .0125 range.  I doubt its ihubbers since they migrate only to "hot stocks" typically. Someone must have a huge GTC at .0125 and "might be in the know" hmmmmmmmmmmm
295 2018-09-15 19:11:58 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
296 2018-09-15 19:11:57 Issues to work on: 

FT when possible to secure stocks, don't trust LCS
Fix control stick to avoid fsmashes misinput for tilt (or learn to use cstick)
Less predictability with hitboxes, I get witch timed way too often 
Work on DI and SDI, I have no clue how to SDI typically
297 2018-09-15 19:07:59 more trade on stocks. More advertisment to trade in stocks should help.
298 2018-09-15 19:07:44 Season 1 - Rising economic growth - stocks, C bonds & commodities/gold 
Season 2 - rising inflation - commodities/gold and inflation-protected bonds
Season 3 - falling economic growth - treasury bonds and inflation-protected bonds
Season 4 - deflation - treasury bonds and stock
299 2018-09-15 19:07:16 It's really delicious - a unique new taste. Huguenot Fine Chocolates in Franschhoek stocks it!
300 2018-09-15 19:06:04 Inflation 
- causes real estate values to go up. 
- real estate goes up, consumers spend more for corporates to increases their revenues and allow for stocks to increase in value. 

Deflation
- drops the price of home values 
- stocks decline during deflation consumers spend less
301 2018-09-15 19:04:58 He barely has any stocks too
302 2018-09-15 19:04:22 Saw you on MSNBC. I'm rooting for you hard and gonna vote for you. You need to take care of your voice/throat. As someone who has trouble with laryngitis, I highly recommend Singer's Saving Grace. I know Rainbow Groc in Jackson stocks it or it's avail on Amazon. 

Good luck!

304 2018-09-15 19:03:39 It’s relative to the cost of living wherever you are. Almost everyone I know lives from month to month. No savings, stocks or bonds, living in their overdraft. Or on credit cards. Some have 2 or 3 jobs & barely see their families.
305 2018-09-15 19:02:18 It’s stocks and shares not crypto

307 2018-09-15 19:01:54 They will be getting a visit from the feds soon then. If you take people's money to buy stocks, bonds, Bitcoin, etc the federal government wants you to pay them millions per year in compliance costs.
308 2018-09-15 19:01:33 and to recycle their surplus dollars back into dollar denominated assets. Stocks, bonds, real estate, weapons, etc. This artificially increases the demand for dollars which enables Fed control of the global economy.

315 2018-09-15 18:54:33 Do you believe past correlation implies future correlation?

Was Theranos equity correlated to stocks? Did it provide diversification?

Anything that goes up 100x will have a historically great Sharpe ratio. Only Q that matters is, is BTC from 60 to 6,000 as likely as 6k to 600k?
316 2018-09-15 18:54:32 NO!! she's the final cinderella girls idol, she's meant to be absolutely perfect, infallible from her appearance, proportions, personality, her scouting YOU out and being rich from investing in stocks herself on top of being a senior highschooler

320 2018-09-15 18:53:41 But not to keep dust out like our cowboys use bandanas for? Stocks seem more tightly wrapped. And painstakingly knotted.
321 2018-09-15 18:52:40 Hey @Uber_Support @Uberproblems @Uber   This really isn’t funny anymore.  We need paid.   It would suck if we all quit driving.   Your stocks would tank even for a day.  #uberstrike
322 2018-09-15 18:52:18 Who cares about the ratings for a network when the nation is mired in a depression which is getting worse by the day. Despite constant propaganda about how great it is, large deficits(a real recovery would do the opposite)poor auto sales, housing stocks struggle, prove otherwise.
323 2018-09-15 18:51:49 Agreed @ddiv09 .  That “news” was already out several weeks ago, before the market was raging.  Everyone wants to blame something, but when stocks run up this far they usually pullback.
324 2018-09-15 18:51:21 My answer/prediction: No, it‘s not. 

And access to more credit will quickly dry up for ZIRP momentum stocks like $TSLA (new car sales are highly cyclical, even more so in the high-end Model S and X price brackets!).

328 2018-09-15 18:46:55 Of more people buy insurance policies, then the cost borne per person will reduce. Stocks of the Insurance Companies will soar.
Just like the implementation of GST increased the tax payer base, we need innovative ideas to increase the number of people opting for insurance.
329 2018-09-15 18:45:11 @JaneRaybould The Repubs "Mostly Bull Economy" doesn't consider working people, like TIME MAG's article for Sept 24, 2018. Stocks are one thing. Working life is another!

333 2018-09-15 18:42:48 Someone is pumping up the stocks to make it look good.  I sure wouldn’t risk that investment.

336 2018-09-15 18:41:26 When that person turns 21 and wants to go out and whatnot, I’m gonna be 32, checking stocks, worrying about the APR on my house loan and refinancing options for my car. I guess youthful beauty is the appeal? But that don’t stay forever. Don’t even know who you’re gonna be at 18.
337 2018-09-15 18:40:21 Chinese stock market drops are not that painful for them compared with the US. Chinese citizens do not have their retirement savings tied up in stocks. What will hurt them is precipitous drops in real estate..1/2

354 2018-09-15 18:23:17 Here’s the POINT!
As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—So Will the Dollar,  Premium Growth Stocks & Bond Yields—As Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Corn Etc.) Decline.
As the Record Tax Cuts & Deregulation Fueled By the Greatest Growth Agenda Ever Implemented—DEBT—Will Decline!
355 2018-09-15 18:22:54 So stupid me signed up for stupid Melee and went 0-2. But took 2 stocks in each set. Again I consider that a win. LMAO 
356 2018-09-15 18:22:49 The quota system has allowed fish stocks around UK waters  to be replenished.
357 2018-09-15 18:21:56 Because whatever DT communicates is intended to manipulate, all he puts forth degrades, even belies, any intrinsic truth therein.
Still, he can reveal a correct thought, e.g, once he's gone, interest in the Media&, esp, Twitter will sharply drop.
The time to dump stocks is near

367 2018-09-15 18:06:48 Privileged people going on about "financial literacy" is a trigger for me. Years ago a then-boyfriend insisted his family wasn't wealthy, he just had a trust fund because he grandfather "bought stocks as a hobby." Me: you need $$$ comfort to risk a dime in the market.

384 2018-09-15 17:58:07 You're probably right. My guess is, to save face, Mueller is going to forcibly arrest Trump, kids, and moron in law and put them in stocks in the middle of Fifth avenue so Americans can throw rotten vegetables at them.
385 2018-09-15 17:57:28 Hello Sagar,

Firstly let me thank you for making videos on Indian Stocks analysis. This does help me with more clarity and insight on how to value stock. Further I’ve been valualing companies myself and would like to know your view on kwality Ltd.Your Insight is appreciated.
386 2018-09-15 17:54:44 I believe that those "advisors" dont care about your money. Well, they do care about your money not for your wealth but for their performance. My mother had a financial advisor who persuaded her to invest her money in penny stocks and he lost HUGE (both in percentage and dollars)

393 2018-09-15 17:45:51 this about right, a good public flogging, followed by time in the stocks when you can pelt them with over-ripe, bendy bananas and limp cucumbers.
394 2018-09-15 17:45:39 90 minutes in the gym ( 30 min warm up) it’s almost 2pm et, I have had no food totally energized, I might even go for a run, this is the type of energy that I’m talking about, and we had a webinar for almost 2 hour on the indexes and stocks.. feeling great
395 2018-09-15 17:44:45 That's called mythology 101. A 401k fund is an investment portfolio that can me stocks, money market, or bonds in any % combination, and ran by professional investment companies. Individuals have no control over its performance, and no, they never go up 40% in a single year.

401 2018-09-15 17:39:07 Heh, the 2005 BC Greens candidate running independently for Vancouver councillor owns stocks from oil and mining corporations, as listed in his disclosure statement. Guess he's had an epiphany.
402 2018-09-15 17:38:26 Ive just got shot of 4 of the 6 by blocking them, 3 had their tweets blocked and didn't follow me (the cheek!) and 1 was David Shaw who always pumps some atrocious stocks yet has 3000 followers (O Dear!) left the other 2 in until I work out how to remove myself

404 2018-09-15 17:38:01 If ppl wanted to stop buying Nike and telling ppl why they stopped, that’s great.
But burning shoes and Nike gear that ppl bought before this stunt? That only helped their stocks go back up again since every action has an opposite reaction.

419 2018-09-15 17:28:40 Decided just for fun to look at company stocks, shocked to discover Shoe Carnival's stock has risen 115% in the last year. Now I'm considering investing in ShowBiz and Blockbuster
420 2018-09-15 17:26:20 If I buy stocks in Apple that makes me an owner of a tiny bit of the company therefore according to you I'm making someone do iPhones and I get part if the profit. Am I misrepresenting things ?

433 2018-09-15 17:15:40 In a bull market, it's better to just hold on stocks rather than selling at loss, except $GE (LoL). I sold 5 stocks at loss this year. My sold/current price.

444 2018-09-15 17:07:59 @cvpayne If histrionic Dems win midterms/2020, picture the bankrupt, mega-divided USA 5-10 years from now. Vengeful, spiteful Dems already using group degradation, deplorables, like 30's Germany. Dems win? Militias form, war. Transition from stocks to gold and prepare to run.

455 2018-09-15 17:00:01 That is correct. She co-sponsored the bill. It wasn’t in any jeopardy of not passing and was unanimously enacted. Asked Dean about DeVos. Ask Dean about Mnuchin. Ask Dean how much progress he’s made on bump stocks.

458 2018-09-15 16:59:45 Regardless of whether stocks are up or down, the bottom line is whether their financial quarter is on target or not. That is what I will be interested in seeing.
459 2018-09-15 16:59:28 True - Norway alone decides on how it manages fisheries ( tech regs etc ) in own EEZ & for Norwegian exclusive stocks. As you know a good portion of the time at EU-NOR negs is used on mngt plans & TAC levels 4 shared stocks. The same with Nor - Ru negs on shared stocks.

468 2018-09-15 16:55:44 I think there’s definitely money to be made if done right. Mostly just curious as to the fact that it’s always the same people pumping these stocks. Many claiming to be holding bags from previous pumps etc. curious as to what signals you use?
469 2018-09-15 16:52:54 Agreed, but none of the companies mentioned are “tech” stocks. They are communication services stocks as S&P will be recategorizing them at month end. Important because even in market economies, communication businesses (but not tech) have always faced significant regulation.
470 2018-09-15 16:52:10 But, the flats seem to appreciate a lot. Lot more than regular investments. After 2000, 2008 market crashes I am very wary of stocks especially with QEs in developed world. Physical assets gold, flat appear better and some FDs.
Agree with never buy gadgets on EMI
471 2018-09-15 16:51:43 Correct we will be out - your point was about aircraft flying and food stocks etc. On this, nothing needs to immediately change the following day.
472 2018-09-15 16:47:07 Usually a drop of 50% is a great buying opportunity though high flying stocks can suffer a bigger drawdown
473 2018-09-15 16:46:20 Bull trap? The stocks going to be heavily undervalued even with mediocre earnings reports, because at 12, their market cap is going to be half their yearly revenue, and we're talking about a company that generated positive income even with all the expenses. Of 8 mil I believe.

Diversification is a real key. And look longer term if young. If old- too bad- they don't pay squat on interest
483 2018-09-15 16:36:31 IMHO you can make sh*t load of money in all the stocks you listed. Instead of becoming a sheep you just need to study the technicals and buy when the signals come flashing. I recycled $PKG twice, $SX three times 

I just make sure my exist strategy is ready before I Buy 
484 2018-09-15 16:35:34 Can we buy US stocks?
485 2018-09-15 16:35:18 Stocks climb a wall of worry.
486 2018-09-15 16:34:39 9/10 times stocks that you bought that moved up a quick 20%-30% failed shortly thereafter.  Seemed like a wise move to me and still does.
487 2018-09-15 16:33:41 I guarantee most people with a decent understanding of the more well-known, large companies in the U.S. could pick 10-15 stocks and outperform the S&P500. However, your 401k isn't setup to work like that. All the best options for 401k force u to put money in businesses that r bad

501 2018-09-15 16:23:33 It’s best not to chase any stocks. Sometimes you’ve just got to let them go cause chasing 9/10 works against you unless you get in at ground floor. Trust your dd and have patience. Look and see how the market reacts and study charts.

519 2018-09-15 16:08:04 Only way to avoid them temporarily is lower volume and low liquidity stocks which aren't as lucrative but once liquidity and volume comes they show up.  Best to buy into plays before they find them.
520 2018-09-15 16:07:53 Scapegoat for taking profits from over valued stocks !!
521 2018-09-15 16:07:05 But the crucial thing is Norway and Norway alone decides. What you call real time management. Not the bureaucratic nonsense we have to go thru. Hopefully soon we might be a coastal state the same as Norway and manage our own stocks

523 2018-09-15 16:06:36 What happens to the abuser, well there could be jail/prison, fines and such. But the Abuser has not been treated for his reason for abusing and will continue. I mean I would love to see them in stocks, especially the white men.

Imagine: man discovers imperfect phenomenon, declares there's no better! Glass-half-empty obsessed hubris!
531 2018-09-15 16:03:38 After the stocks.
532 2018-09-15 16:03:02 They probably shorted their own stocks and bought it back! Creeps no Nike household
533 2018-09-15 16:02:26 Even though real estate assets are about the same size as stocks (~$35T), there is no historical institutional system providing broad access to real estate.
534 2018-09-15 16:01:02 Well, I dont think people buy enough to move the stocks.  It is fund buying.  So, we saw them come in months ago and we see many IPOs starting so the big boys know it is time.  Politics with Trump, the mining woes, and negative gold trend may have impacts.  But we going up.
535 2018-09-15 16:00:56 I have weed stocks what are they gonna do about it? be mad?
536 2018-09-15 15:58:13 Arya. If they were stocks, I'd short Cersei.

538 2018-09-15 15:55:52 Would it be in my favor to switch from a risky
 80%equity /20%fixed return to a
Modest 60%stock/40%bond type strategy.

I'm learning how to invest in stocks and just want clarification
539 2018-09-15 15:53:44 He’s just a puppet for the CAPP on the public teet while getting rich on oil stocks 
540 2018-09-15 15:52:35 To be fair though, almost all stocks are at all time highs right now lol
541 2018-09-15 15:52:28 What about depleting stocks as the article mentions! More attention needs to be paid to that! #SaveOurOceans
542 2018-09-15 15:52:18 I don’t know what c-capm is. I’m not really educated in Finance and Econ, just know that if you told me you could guarantee 20% yearly return, correlated to stocks and bonds, I’d take it. I’m generally confused by arguments surrounding “non-correlation” and its importance.
543 2018-09-15 15:52:12 @invesys_in sir, how many years old  and consistent is your Nifty, Banknifty and stocks Future advisory? Thanks

546 2018-09-15 15:49:41 Seems like a contest is in order:

“Blanks” low correlation to traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds make it an attractive asset to include in your portfolio for diversified return streams
547 2018-09-15 15:48:58 I think the only value of movies for business is as contrarian indicators. Eg the last movie where stocks were presented as a way to get rich was mission impossible 2, which appeared in may 2000.
548 2018-09-15 15:48:52 So I recently started investing in the stock market not a bunch just small and work my way up , what app do you all recommend? I was going between @acorns  & M1 Financing?? Are either of these any good ? Or anyone have any other suggestions?! #Stocks #HelpMe

553 2018-09-15 15:46:09 My dad still thinks @LICIndiaForever policies will make him rich.  The guy who sold us the policies became quite rich but us. We stayed the same. Mutual funds and stocks is the way forward. Older people don't believe that. Highest mis sold products from banks: LI and MF
554 2018-09-15 15:45:50 Pero kapag inaral mo (just like my mama's mentor), kahit ikaw na directly ang maginvest sa stocks na gusto mo right? Atleast iyo lang, wala na cut sa mf
555 2018-09-15 15:45:48 People don’t understand it’s impossible to scale a 6-7 figure account if you short HTB small cap stocks. Not enough borrows, fees to expensive, partial fills, and you’ll own the majority of the volume. That’s why I had to switch to CFDs it solved all of my problems
556 2018-09-15 15:45:43 done

562 2018-09-15 15:43:14 yes meron. everyone on a mutual fund has 'pool money' tapos paghahatian niyo yun. it's a baby step to learning how to invest lalo na pag hindi pa ready magcommit to individually invest on stocks. mutual funds guarantees you have a cut.
563 2018-09-15 15:42:28 Arrest him and make an example of him, make sure he cleans the wall first as a public display of humility. Just like in the days of the stocks and public floggings.
564 2018-09-15 15:41:57 I picked up when the stocks hit higher and now 90% red .

Man up.
576 2018-09-15 15:30:28 Because you are selling it like you did something for the people! How generous of you to use our money to help us! You are just amazing.  But you vote for tax cut for the wealthy so they can buy back their stocks! Cannot wait to you are no longer a Florida Senator!

580 2018-09-15 15:25:08 Are there any stocks of spare, small Delta II parts (e.g. valves, thrusters) that ULA could sell? Atlas missile parts are everywhere, and I’m sure a lot of space enthusiasts would love a piece of Delta history like that.

583 2018-09-15 15:25:01 Exactly! Every company like #ripple who respects itself has a big stake taking the same exposure as their investors, the same stands for stocks as well.

591 2018-09-15 15:20:09 Until the bottom falls out. Until the poor are too broke to purchase any more I-phones and groceries and water and clean air. Until there are no more stocks to buy up and falsely shore up said stock market. Until there is no more food to eat or air to breath. Money isn't life.

599 2018-09-15 15:13:13 #6. The price of the cryptocurrency goes up or down based on supply and demand + public perception of the company. Just like Stocks.

The better the company is doing, usually the higher the stock price. Take Apple and Amazon as examples.

617 2018-09-15 15:01:43 From October of last year through July and August of this year ( when did this last commercial run again ) oh yes September . If you believe obama the stocks were already headingthat direction and actually after the commercial have flattened their trend which shows it hurt Nike’s

I looked at the whole “beef” and MGK started, first speaking on Hallie, then spinning a whole bunch of conspiracy theories that Em Blackballed. MGK didn’t stopped there either, he decided to take jabs at Em on that Tech9’s track.

These are not stocks but monetary instruments
630 2018-09-15 14:53:31 If any asset had ~0 derivatives, it would be very volatile.

E.g. Major currencies are more “stable” bc of the small % changes but the volatility is shifted to the leverage. Same with stocks => options

Spot BTC will be stabilized as derivatives go up (gold), traders go to vol

Fiscal responsibility: so the rich can keep their money
Deregulation: so the industrialist can pollute and exploit at will
Small govt: both of the above
Freedom: to amass stocks of weapons
Personal responsibility: to deny/imprison the less fortunate

However our stocks will be replenished in October, we will also be working on new designs for certain products #TeamAvec

784 2018-09-15 13:12:34 A lot of mass shootings in the US are done with AR-15's, which are legal.  Not "real" assault weapons.  They add bump stocks, which ARE legal and basically turn the AR -15 into an assault rifle. So, to me, this means we do need more laws.  We need to ban bump stocks.
785 2018-09-15 13:12:20 Hey Brandon, sorry for the delay, I have heard back from the buyer who advised that we were out of stock across the country - it's proving popular - but that stocks should resume normal levels over the next week or two so you should be able to get it soon! Rachel
786 2018-09-15 13:11:21 Why should I put money in crypto over stocks? Stocks have been much safer particularly for those who enter late into the investing game. Late entrances have done badly in crypto even if the trader/investor is experience.

791 2018-09-15 13:06:30 I like volatility in the direction of the trend. I make identical bets across all of the markets and stocks I trade, but the contracts and shares I hold are generally smaller in times of high volatility.

811 2018-09-15 12:52:47 if you're going to post about badly performing stocks, at least do your research. The lockup actually expired on 8/24 and was the catalyst for the decline you see now.

832 2018-09-15 12:31:48 Slight problem, the US wants to permanently ban any Canadian who has ever used it, or works for a firm that grows/sells it, or invests in it. That could decimate your tourism industry. Many of us even have pot stocks in our investment portfolios and don't even know it

and #HAVELLS sep futures around 650-655 with sl 530-635...
852 2018-09-15 12:08:10 And when bad news hits and the stock drops $20-30 they are trying to buy it back up again filling the  with even more stocks
853 2018-09-15 12:08:08 Choice of stocks matters. If u hold HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Nestle, Colgate, Asian Paints, Pidilite etc kind of stocks its very hard to lose money over longish period of time. But return wud not be that much spectacular. Small caps may give multi-bagger returns but risky
854 2018-09-15 12:08:04 Unlike the recovery from the 2015 correction, commercial traders have been unable to entice hedge funds to speculate on the upside in stocks. Over the past two-years, while major indexes have gained 40-90%, hedge funds shrunk their net long positions by 41% according to the COT.

917 2018-09-15 11:03:25 10 years ago today, the worst financial crisis of our lifetime started... are we about to suffer another crash?
Will it be #trump 's #tradewar that sparks it or his #impeachment?
Hopefully it doesn't happen, but hope for the best and prepare for the worst

960 2018-09-15 10:06:28 a huge decline means a huge rise eventually after buying cheaper stocks especially if they fix their shit
961 2018-09-15 10:06:25 Think about Cube Ent, they took back they're statement about kicking out HYUNA and EDawn because they're stocks dropped, that's exactly why K-ARMYs aren't buying BTS' merch because that's the only way they'll get their attention. Because BigHit has been silent about this issue.
962 2018-09-15 10:06:18 Ummmm no. Remember #Conservturds sayin stocks for Nike went down because of the ‘protests’? They did. For a bit. But so were ALL sports companies. Probably because BTS was over. It hurts to be on the wrong side of history.

973 2018-09-15 09:53:47 Within the first week of the ad, online sales spiked by 31% , it was at about 12% the previous year. No coincidence and definitely a correlation between the sales and their stocks.

977 2018-09-15 09:45:49 Yep. It was a rough last couple of weeks for me. Was busy with life and missed a couple of great setups. Got caught in a dump where I got wicked pretty hard with some slippage. Thank goodness for alts, forex, and stocks. Still profitable over that time period overall.
978 2018-09-15 09:44:47 Agreed 100%, but the next economic crisis is just around the corner. Central banks have reinflated the EVERYTHING bubble. Stocks, bonds & real estate, with historically low interest rates and money printing. Deutsche Bank has $60 TRILLION derivatives that will implode the system.
979 2018-09-15 09:43:27 I see public stocks, bonds and real estate in bubble territory, would replace it with e.g. Bitcoin.

1023 2018-09-15 09:01:42 It is a mine field no doubt about it. Even the stocks you know are going to give you that return can play funny buggers from time to time & push back your exit strategy point. Research, getting in early & patience are imo the key to making £,s
1024 2018-09-15 09:01:09 Cons: you have to give a % of your profits depending on which programme you go with, their charting ain’t the best.

1161 2018-09-15 06:04:53 You realize most of those ten are fake right? Climate change is not believed by "most people" he did not call neo-nazis fine people. He did do something after Vegas shooting including visiting the victims and repealing the bump stocks rules that Obama approved.

1164 2018-09-15 06:02:20 it'll be "getting through this paradygm into the next". hedging with precious metals is always a good idea, and have an (exit) strategy: 

Q's:
when do you sell your silver/assets? 
and what will you invest in next? 
will crypto and PM go up together while fiat and stocks crash?
1165 2018-09-15 06:01:10 Do you have any idea about the stocks?
1166 2018-09-15 06:00:54 Le décret du contentieux social sortira seulement début octobre, soit encore 3 mois en retard apres la date prévue. Réforme de la justice bâclée. Application au 1/1/19 : fiasco à suivre ! Stocks en hausse à prévoir. Peu importe si les assurés crèvent entre temps.
1167 2018-09-15 06:00:10 Yes, definitely. If I wanted to simply get Nifty returns from MF's I would have invested in an index fund. After spending sufficient time & efforts doing research for picking the right sectors, stocks & the MF schemes which hold those stocks, I expect the schemes to beat Nifty.
1168 2018-09-15 06:00:00 Agree. And monthly simple returns hugely overstate the average return of speculative risky stocks.
1169 2018-09-15 05:59:51 My son Zach is gonna really be making some dough when he gets older. Sleeps late and wake up early! Kids are like stocks.

1175 2018-09-15 05:51:52 So many stores currently placing much of their stocks on offer through out the year. Is it marketing or something more? 
I think this could be an indication that most Kenyan's purchasing power has gone low so stocks are staying in the counters longer. Shouldnt govt be wary?
1176 2018-09-15 05:51:15 Nike's stocks are up.

1190 2018-09-15 05:36:04 For me investing on stocks is the easiest way to become wealthy but definetely not the fastest way:)
1191 2018-09-15 05:35:26 Be careful who you invest your time in. Some stocks aren't worth it
1192 2018-09-15 05:34:27 It's a stopgap solution to flat sales: it works for a couple of years but then you have to find a different way to grow. Hint: next in line is the iPad. Kill the mini, rise the prices. Hint2: next year Apple's revenues will go up, buy stocks now.
1193 2018-09-15 05:33:56 Wasn’t talking to u.   Just calling u out for being a lying hypocrite.   And stop talking about stocks here which is really quite irrelevant

Could you elaborate please.

1196 2018-09-15 05:25:02 Like marijuana stocks, sometimes it's better to wait for the dip to reap the gains than to buy in too  soon.

1228 2018-09-15 04:43:47 apple stocks rise by 69%.
1229 2018-09-15 04:43:17 All that is is investors taking advantage of Nike’s stock dropping. Buy low sell high. Has nothing to do with supporting Nike. All about making money on stocks.

1243 2018-09-15 04:15:39 Yes all over the news and the stocks went down. That's the intent of bringing back old news. Gets people talking about an old story to drive fear into investors. When you invest long enough you begin to see the news cycle differently and investors react to the news like its new.

1319 2018-09-15 03:04:25 millennials pay/paid for expensive credit with no opportunity for any real gains on savings, CD's or mutual funds. And what millennial could effectively purchase stocks or bonds? Real estate? Millennials are fighting an uphill battle. And only a few are winning.

1336 2018-09-15 02:50:15 I think... there’s someone working on VSCO inspired film stocks for Luminar. Not sure if they’ll release it or what ;)
1337 2018-09-15 02:48:38 Exactly, I only have alerts set up instead of stops in volatile portfolio of mine. It has worked flawlessly ever since I started playing in #CAMJ - 

In blue chip I use hard stops as huge money of mine is involved and they (stocks) respect MA like anything.
1338 2018-09-15 02:48:23 That’s the problem for the stock market- China has to feel the pain enough to come to the table, which means pain for everyone short term. But keep buying stocks at  astronomical valuations, for the bulls out there.

1418 2018-09-15 01:51:15 Is GoFundMe the only place to crowdfund stupid ideas? Seems like that’d be a good market. Investing 50 bucks in an art project would be way more interesting than buying stocks.
1419 2018-09-15 01:50:29 Same to you. I’m a boring investor. Long term holds on almost all my stocks and I’m 100% equity. IRAs only though.
1420 2018-09-15 01:50:16 Kavanagh is dirty! So are some of these senators! Time to start investing some of these Republican Senators. How many of them have increased their assets/bank accounts or stocks (tip offs) since Trump? Time for the senate to work for US as they should be instead of the rich only!

1424 2018-09-15 01:45:12 Local media:
"Bitcoin Has Failed - Forget It"

Never seen so much FUD in an article. In the end it even says you shouldn't touch it and just focus on stocks.

Strong bullish signal for me
1425 2018-09-15 01:44:43 ...stocks are fake news? How does that even make sense.

1428 2018-09-15 01:42:16 . .leave it as cash. Dividends and buybacks do help workers with 401K's but 401K's are usually a mixture of companies. But the top executives get stocks and stock options so the top 1% are the winners.. . .

1435 2018-09-15 01:36:03 Right? People act like these crimes started when Trump took office. They have been doing their thing, whatever that might be, for years. They all have something. Be it stocks, real estate, offshore accounts/something. Rest assured, it Did not start when trump walked in the door.

1445 2018-09-15 01:20:06 In the wash up - some properties will be great investments, some will not.  Just like some businesses (stocks) are good investments and others are not.
Those who judge as one market, are misguided.

1449 2018-09-15 01:14:03 The ACA subsidies should have gone towards the cost of care with regulations to ultimately reduce the cost of care. Giving $$ to insurers didnt reduce the cost of care. It raised the value of stocks.

1452 2018-09-15 01:13:04 @JFordBaer obviously you know nothing about stocks or how they work. Stick to sports!
1453 2018-09-15 01:12:40 cube released a final statement that e.dawn and hyuna WERE in fact kicked out, but their broke gold-digging asses saw their stocks decreasing because of it and now they’re just saying they’re in discussion
1454 2018-09-15 01:10:32 Interesting...  a hurricane bares down on the country...  stocks go up in anticipation of people spending and insurance payouts for damage; payouts sourced from taking money out of the market.
1455 2018-09-15 01:10:02 The stock market is wild right now. So many IPO's giving 100%-150% returns. I'm not in it personally, but I have family who have been making massive gains. Especially the tech stocks...
1456 2018-09-15 01:09:46 And what about mutual funds such as j p Morgan..mackenzie etc etc that has pot stocks what to people who owns those funds? A lot of people will be out from USA ...?
1457 2018-09-15 01:08:29 By their lack of action to the upside , I think the Bank stocks  are telling us that they do not see a big breakout in interest rates, at least in the long-term interest rates, anytime soon.

1459 2018-09-15 01:06:15 All my cash in invested so I'm periodically watching to sell signals. Not really looking for ideas at the moment. My holdings are exhibiting relative strength and I'm well positioned for any downturn. Currently up 17%. Might sell $VLO to make my money work elsewhere. #stocks
1460 2018-09-15 01:04:20 Don't know if anybody cares about this but AMD stock is up over 200% since April. Who said tech stocks were dead? Oh right, it was @CNBC 
1461 2018-09-15 01:03:55 I think management is not the strongest. Good management can make money in bad deposits and bad management can find a way to ruin shareholder value with a gem too. But since it's premier junior stocks in uranium. Will put few #$$ just to dip a toe.
1462 2018-09-15 01:00:36 FedEx can pick up a package up in London at 5 p.m. and deliver it the next morning by 10:30 in Seattle. I can order stocks right from my phone. Amazon has same day delivery. But it's impossible to put together a response letter in 24 hours?
1463 2018-09-15 00:59:41 Disagree with this out of context assumption. 
Younger Americans are saddled with student debt. Buried under high housing costs. 
They do not have the discretionary income for stocks.
1464 2018-09-15 00:59:21 Every Canadian is part of Canada Pension Plan, which has pot stocks, thus, every single Canadian, including non investors, is de facto a holder of pot stocks. So, 100% ban of entire nation.
1465 2018-09-15 00:53:41 Maybe he'll just flee the country?
Good idea to sell the stocks just in case.
1466 2018-09-15 00:52:37 Jess guess you could ask RT & Mr Putin to explain this from Twitter. Maybe even ask Mr Trump to ask Mr Putin, they are such good friends? Guess real issue is why men create & use Novichok or other germ warfare weapons. To make sure stocks are irradicated so it can't happen again.
1467 2018-09-15 00:50:55 Should’ve bought more stocks in AMD shits boomin

1470 2018-09-15 00:50:03 MARKET WRAP:<br>

1471 2018-09-15 00:49:53 Today we can pick up a package at 5 p.m. in London and deliver it the next morning by 10:30 in Seattle. I can buy stocks from my phone. We have same day delivery from Amazon. Yet people believe you can't put together a letter that quickly. I guess that's too difficult for them.

1490 2018-09-15 00:27:58 Marketing ploy, ask financial planners what is a potentially good stock & they will guide you to one much like Nike, the rebound was newbies & old salts jumping on low stocks knowing the rebound was coming.

1589 2018-09-16 23:18:21 So I have been really quiet on Twitter wrt to the market, but frigg me this is just getting nuts. #stocks I could point out tons of problems, but wow...  We shall see.
1590 2018-09-16 23:18:12 Actually that's not true. All those tax cuts just allowed companies to buy back their stocks. The economy was strong before trump took office. Things didn't just ger good because he got elected. He's riding the post 2008 wave thst was implemented under Obama. Nice tey though.
1591 2018-09-16 23:18:08 10% a year? Don’t spread too thin ... most stocks grow 16-30% like $V or $MA easy steady gains not too volatile
1592 2018-09-16 23:17:50 No doubt there will still be bargains to be found at a micro level where you can obtain a decent net yield (4-6%) comparable with investing in stocks with some capital growth potential over the long-term positioned as a bonus. Is that what you are helping clients identify??
1593 2018-09-16 23:14:54 @giveittomikeyk Yeah Trump and his rich buddies short all the affected stocks

83% of the Republican tax cuts went to the top 1%. Most big companies used their tax windfall to buy back their own stocks, a lot of it. It is no wonder that S&P index is trading near its high.

1600 2018-09-16 23:08:25 You do know many Americans do not have stocks or a 401k

1607 2018-09-16 23:03:49 We'll keep the first point out if we were to account for the actual trades they make and the free content they give. To be taught that is a different story, like actually not by yourself. And these guys don't manipulate low cap penny stocks since they don't do alerts.

1612 2018-09-16 22:59:45 Know this - At each tick there are buyers and sellers. Technical analysis does not give whole world few same levels, otherwise it markets will not remain liquid. So pick any 2-3 TA parameters/indicators and WATCH for weeks price action of few stocks.

1621 2018-09-16 22:49:09 Hi! Could you recommend me some good websites; or ways how to invest in your stocks?. Thanks
1622 2018-09-16 22:48:45 alam ko limited stocks lang yung sa cna e.. meron pa ba?
1623 2018-09-16 22:47:46 What about our infrastructure? Our healthcare? Wages are stagnant and CEO’s are taking their tax windfall and buying back stocks. 
Who is this message REALLY for?
1624 2018-09-16 22:46:51 My Surface needs some new material... Hope stocks last.
1625 2018-09-16 22:45:20 so i found out my favorite teacher left after i graduated son of a bitch my mood dropped faster than cubes stocks again i was really looking forward to visit her
1626 2018-09-16 22:44:54 Yeah, but chocolate button stocks are insufficient.
1627 2018-09-16 22:44:42 not even close to what I can do. Stocks on stocks bro, lol
1628 2018-09-16 22:44:21 but in #pennystocks share size is not the only variable to consider. we've all been there, been the bagholder for pump & dump / low float / heavily manipulated garbage. for u 2 completely disregard the risk level involved in these #stocks is mind boggling
1629 2018-09-16 22:44:11 Like you would get an honest answer from the league?  Come on man..like Matthews said in the post game presser they will come up with some type of bogus explanation that the call was right. The league and its officials are the laughing stocks of sports these days.
1630 2018-09-16 22:44:00 I wait for the answer from him.
If they would have invested in stocks, they would be rich now.
1631 2018-09-16 22:43:11 My first day at work after graduating was 9/12/2001. They wanted to fire me that same day because of 9/11.
On 9/14/2008 I invested what was going to be the first of many more investments on stocks. Next day stock markets crashed.
For some reason gods want me to be entrepreneur.
1632 2018-09-16 22:42:48 John, no doubt Canadian RE was on fire for the last 20yrs but if you want to do a fair comparison you dont just put 5% down in stocks, you also borrow 95% and put those in stocks as well.
Ave. S&P return since 1928 is about 10%/y.
1633 2018-09-16 22:41:37 Yeah Donnie can at least say he lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% down to 21%. But of course we know that most of these companies just bought back their stocks and laid a bunch of people off. These tax cuts will be paid back by gutting social security and Medicare.

1635 2018-09-16 22:39:52 Lol you bought stocks... ok
1636 2018-09-16 22:37:19 Your occasional reminder that 84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.
1637 2018-09-16 22:36:46 Poor people don’t have much in the way of stocks… Didn’t know if you knew this or not
1638 2018-09-16 22:36:37 You made money because of the path that Obama made for you. It takes two years to see the effect of the new president . You will soon see the truth. Sell those stocks quick .
1639 2018-09-16 22:36:13 Errr, when you cut taxes on the rich who buy stocks and companies, eliminate capital gains, the rich and the companies do better today. But when you take jobs from the middle and don’t raise wages it’s like a vice. We’re being squeezed out!
1640 2018-09-16 22:35:30 Yeah, about that newfound wealth. Just so you know, most people these days don’t own stocks and live paycheck to paycheck. You’re preaching to the choir, the wealthy already support the GOP because that is who they represent.
1641 2018-09-16 22:35:02 Have you seen Nikes stocks shoot through the roof Jack ?

Obviously, you're on the wrong side again...
1642 2018-09-16 22:34:49 The referendum was a gross abrogation of duty by Parliament. If we better utilised our migrant population and showed the awesome contribution instead of squeezing housing stocks and stretching everything this would never have happened. Don’t blame immigrants, blame Blair.
1643 2018-09-16 22:32:45 Apple is behind Samsung right now, we all know they just manipulate their stocks in trading to made people believe they are 1Trillion wealthy.
Funny thing is Samsung has 480K employees while apple has 120K employees. Samsung has 4 times employees compared to Apple.Who is wealthy?
1644 2018-09-16 22:31:48 Corporations do not hire when they get tax cuts, they repurchase their stocks and pay down debt. It’s rare that tax cuts to corporations help the working class
1645 2018-09-16 22:30:33 Only if you own stocks
1646 2018-09-16 22:30:12 On the plus size @nike stocks went up 41%!!!! I told y’all to invest!!!
1647 2018-09-16 22:29:30 All i know is that $TSLA #volatility is a/o 80% from the 6 month average of 50%..... We like it! I mean there’s money on the table. How you get it, is your strategy  #options #stocks #markets #daytraders #WallStreet
1648 2018-09-16 22:26:04 As you count the money in your stocks and 401 k....if all negated...donate it
1649 2018-09-16 22:26:02 If patience is one of your strengths, you will find it to be invaluable for #trading. Takes time for good low-risk setups to appear for swing trading, but the wait is usually heavily rewarded.

1651 2018-09-16 22:25:13 People delegate thinking to other people in almost everything in life. You buy stocks because your stock broker says so. You believe the weather man on TV. etc etc. Let’s not berate people that delegate their political think.

1655 2018-09-16 22:23:26 More than half your population do not have $400 to deal with an unforeseen emergency or bill. Growth numbers of stocks holders in Facebook, Amazon, Google and Netflix are phoney according to candidate Trump in 2016. Power not only corrupts all, but corrupts the mind, your mind.
1656 2018-09-16 22:22:41 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
1657 2018-09-16 22:22:01 That’s why I’m loading up on silver! When/if the Dems take back control, the United States Dollar will plummet, skyrocketing the value of my precious metals portfolio. Buy PM, sell stocks when conservatives are in power, and sell precious metals to buy stocks when they aren’t!
1658 2018-09-16 22:21:13 It's NOT coming down to us; it's all for the rich. Our gas is higher and milk and bread, but the wealthy get more on their stocks. I'm sure THEY appreciate you . . .

1660 2018-09-16 22:19:46 In 1986, the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling because of the extreme depletion of most of the whale stocks.

Funny how commercial whaling was still legal when our southern whale population was the lowest.
I'm sure THAT was just a coincidence?
1661 2018-09-16 22:19:41 Ahh that guy should stick to IT and Drug stocks. He has no clue on Geology and Mining let alone a chemical process like Lithium Brines. He has done 5 minutes research and thinks hes SME on the stock but can’t even get basic company infrastructure info right. $AGY

1674 2018-09-16 22:01:59 Really, where did you get your “facts” from? The majority of Americans want to see those tax returns. If there’s nothing to hide then show them. And if there was I would be, but there isn’t. The inflated economy is due to tax cuts for the rich that bought their stocks back.

At the same time, they will publicly suggest buying stocks (i.e. this presentation). Once they have accumulated enough BTC, ...
1685 2018-09-16 21:48:34 $MSFT & $INTC are both very liquid stocks so contrasting their liquidity is not very interesting.

1694 2018-09-16 21:40:56 If any thing 2008 financial debacle tells one thing! Don't invest in a few individual stocks or sectors! Invest in broad indices national or global eg ETFs like SPY, VT or ACWI. Even if a crisis, stocks will bounce back & so will you faster & with greater certainty.
1695 2018-09-16 21:40:16 I realized a handicap in my trades. I wasn’t giving enough attention to the “quality” of catalyst and what it takes to really move stocks on the long side
1696 2018-09-16 21:40:15 I haven't played the older version, even though I have it, but the rules are 99% the same. The rules aren't complex - only 6 things you can do - but the strategy can be hard to parse. It's essentially a stocks game, so some parts can feel opaque.
1697 2018-09-16 21:40:10 and especially if its sm they arent only investing in their artists but like they literally have money invested every fucking where. obvs their stocks might go down at some point but you cant say its bc of a gp lol

1704 2018-09-16 21:34:24 It doesn't & there are far too many selfish parents with a hidden negative agenda. Such parents need penalising. I think we should bring back wooden stocks so society can throw rotten tomatoes at them while shopping on a Saturday afternoon.
1705 2018-09-16 21:33:03 No - Amihud is an illiquidiy measure. $APPL's is lower than $IBM's, thus it is less illiquid, but these are both very liquid stocks, so comparing them is not very easy compared to something less liquid.

This same very bougie mall also, literally, has a tiny convenience store in it too, that stocks typical stuff like toothbrushes, cup noodles, and lotto tickets.
1713 2018-09-16 21:25:26 so u trade #pennystocks as well as market leaders like $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $NVDA $NFLX $BABA $BA etc... u're saying risking 7 cents with the low float, crowded pump & dump stocks is the same risk as with the institutionally traded higer float mid / large caps?

If you need help with with crackers and tabie decorations let us know. Stocks are going fast. 


1718 2018-09-16 21:17:54 You're doing four stocks, so the comparison is more difficult. They're all pretty liquid, but some are more liquid ($BAC) than others ($LOGI).
1719 2018-09-16 21:17:06 I checked at $PLNT today, I’ve been following it for a while now. However, once again I got to the conclusion that there are better stocks with a better setup right now
1720 2018-09-16 21:16:45 Rocky week coming for #stocks, #tradewar with #china hits big $200B test, Mueller closing in. If you’re not in cash might as well hold on!

1724 2018-09-16 21:12:44 Playing crowded stocks doesn’t allow one to expand. Yes I get it the liquidity but there’s that lonely ticker you pass and then it just gets all the attention.. Play your #FANG I’ll play my #lessexposed

1726 2018-09-16 21:11:37 Happy B day. You deserve better. This is exactly what I keep asking people to ask themselves. What is the economy doing for themselves? If you don't have stocks to celebrate, you're stuck. Companies will raise minimum wages to a higher still not living wage & will make more.

1729 2018-09-16 21:09:17 Yes. I once saw an economist wondering why the price of copper isn't going up as stocks dwindle. Gee, I wonder if certain nations being wholly owned by mining corporations has something to do with that.
1730 2018-09-16 21:08:47 $LNC is not an automobile company, it's an insurance company. Lincoln is a sub-brand of Ford ($F). Pay closer attention to the stocks you are referencing.

1740 2018-09-16 21:01:39 Hey Diane, stocks are a gamble, if you play the market you should be prepared to pay when things go bad.  But then people like you with insider information get rich, perhaps you want to tell the folks about how you got all your money.
1741 2018-09-16 21:01:18 Does anyone see a pattern here? Notice Nike down in stock market...do you know who's buying up stock at rock bottom prices? Soros, knowing the stocks gotta go up..now maybe CNN? What makes me sick is our boycotts are making people like Soros richer!
1742 2018-09-16 21:01:18 @naval Best way to make solid money short term (say in the next 30-60 days) while eliminating much of the chance of losing money? (say gambling or risky stocks). Thank you!

1745 2018-09-16 20:59:27 Just because a bunch of rich people invest a bunch of money into the stock market - into companies they have an ear in, and in stocks that benefited from your disastrous policies, doesn’t make the economy strong.

1755 2018-09-16 20:46:13 I’m aware of who owns 90% of stocks. You go and ask your friends, family and neighbors if they invest in a 401k plan at work or some kind of retirement plan. This rule protects them too.

So you can buy say 10 Lionel Messi’s for £12 each, then depending on his performance, his price can go up/down and you can make profit or loss.

People who bought in 2017 thought it was like buying stocks.

1954 2018-09-16 18:09:25 What a lovely spread you have there. I know it's been tough but when the boat comes in it should do so big time. I'm two thirds in pm stocks and one third uranium.
1955 2018-09-16 18:08:03 Not when stocks are depleted and refurnished every year and that 9 different branches of government, military and uranium experts say it isn't.
1956 2018-09-16 18:08:00 Depends on which side you were on. Austria was under a strict embargo, and metals were sequestered /bought by the war industry. They were more opportunities for that in the Allied side: loads of ppl in US got rich with Buying European owned stocks for cheap.
1957 2018-09-16 18:06:01 Sure. But your "offshore" capital still can be invested in US stocks and bonds (& often is).
1958 2018-09-16 18:05:54 Very difficult to tell the path...but the magic show (stocks up, bond up, gold/silver down) will end.

1963 2018-09-16 18:00:58 This summer's row about scallops off France was pretty enlightening with big Scottish boats undermining the small French boats by destructively scraping the sea floor at the wrong time of year & thereby harming the scallop stocks forever.
1964 2018-09-16 18:00:52 What many aren’t considering if that a risk off move in stocks lead to flows into metals and miners.  There isn’t enough physical for China to control the price re yuan much longer.  Is what happened in 2016.  Oil fell 20.  Stocks fell 9 pct.  gold was up 30.   Miners 170
1965 2018-09-16 18:00:40 I’m sorry, lemme get this right, you guys are glad that SMs stocks are dropping?!

1975 2018-09-16 17:51:31 KOSDAQ is closed so SM stocks can’t drop in a closed exchange market. The screenshots you keep sharing is the last data which is from September 14. 
1976 2018-09-16 17:49:02 Why wd cutting taxes on American corporations and then charging the Chinese instead make stocks go down?
1977 2018-09-16 17:48:50 Time to withdraw the stocks  
1978 2018-09-16 17:44:57 Are you against record employment, record wages, record stocks, 4.2 GDP, ISIS wrecked, NK pacified, hostages and missing soldiers returned?  America is doing amazing and Democrats want to stop it.  Why?

1982 2018-09-16 17:42:28 Wondering how you are feeling about @Nike and @Kaepernick7 now that sales are soaring...MANDATORY that YOU watch the stocks go up!!!
1983 2018-09-16 17:42:21 Selective valuation analysis (or PE obsession as 'value' is subjective) by them becoz their list has Kotak, AsianP, Pidi, Bata!

Predictable growth & margin + Quality of mgmt & process shud probably weigh higher for LT Retail Portfolio.

Discl: hold most stocks mentioned earlier
1984 2018-09-16 17:41:22 GREAT question. Each trade must have the same dollar risk. This prevents major P/L swings (allows steady balance growth). Your size will depend on the stop. Find the stop first, THEN adjust your size. I risk 1% of my account balance per trade until I get to 4-6 stocks (8 max).

1992 2018-09-16 17:38:01 The thing is if you daytrade or swing trade a name like this and have a bad entry you can usually wait and it comes back to you. No risk of bankruptcy etc etc. I love finding stocks like this, This one is one of my bread & butter names I can depend on

1996 2018-09-16 17:31:30 The setups on them are geared toward swing trading. It could all change tomorrow morning. It’s just some stocks and ETFs that I will be watching.
1997 2018-09-16 17:31:00 So Trump &GOP gave massive tax cuts to billionaires and millionaires who, by the way, didn’t need any more money,so they bought stocks. The stock market rises. What a shocker! But middle-class jobs, healthcare, education, wages, lifestyle, Social Security and Medicare not so much

2010 2018-09-16 17:22:16 Oh, I will... Very few stocks have this future growth potential

I just believe if it can hit near $14 after 2 days... It can go to $20 in a week

2012 2018-09-16 17:21:08 1.) if you need your money tomorrow, or next year, it shouldn’t be in individual stocks or even the S&P. 

2.) if they didn’t sell at rock bottom - they would be up 131% from ten years ago.
2013 2018-09-16 17:20:43 Dont forget with the case not going their way if they slip to $5 or so lots of funds have to dump them since simply based on that basis. There are simply other U stocks that will rise much more %wise with less risk like URG and UUUU and UEC. Also, CCJ is not within s232 as of yet
2014 2018-09-16 17:18:42 If I understood stocks I would buy stocks. I feel like the white lie of society grabs me and tells me I'm too dumb to try. Put in the 9-5 bc investing is for thoes who have a degree. I need a cliff. The point of no return. Someone point me in the right direction.

2033 2018-09-16 17:03:51 Blockchain tech doesn’t need token or coin. Cryptos just like stocks, small startups use ICO to financing. However, small startups just want the money. That’s it.

2034 2018-09-16 17:03:47 Because mkts will b very red on Monday most likely and China stocks have been awful this year and this is not a low float stock. It very well could double in time but I just think it’s gonna take a while. Just another hype stock for now imo. If ur long I hope it goes up.

2060 2018-09-16 16:43:41 "Pretty limited? They literally produce as much as they need. And even then other shops can also order and sell them like Nippon Yassan."

sure they did pre-order stocks by demand, but still, the time is pretty limited, and it's through P-Bandai. It's not publicly sold
2061 2018-09-16 16:43:37 Do you ever profile people who support things like this? Like the soldiers who took pictures of their nike boots they were proud to wear? Or the millions of people who bought nike recently to increase their stocks? I can see the media has learned nothing in the last few years
2062 2018-09-16 16:43:32 The largest market cap tech stocks did not create any ground breaking tech.  Mostly websites that the masses found easy to use.

2064 2018-09-16 16:43:05 In America, who really benefits from these numbers? Who are the owners of the stocks, the ones owning Large Corps and by back their own stock with the benefits provided by the Tax Scam of Dec 2017?
2065 2018-09-16 16:41:52 shut up bro
2066 2018-09-16 16:40:57 i'm crying, sm stocks dropped just because they didn't release exo's cb teaser today when everyone expected it, imagine having that much power
2067 2018-09-16 16:40:16 Sm's stocks did not drop. Smh it's not working hours there. Their stock exchange is not open yet.

2070 2018-09-16 16:39:41 @IBDinvestors IBD style investors. No idea if an ETF can effectively capture what IBD does a good job at, identifying stocks about to go on a short term run.

2079 2018-09-16 16:36:30 SM wanted to add members in SUJU and ELF weren’t having it so they bought shit loads of stocks and then threatened SM using those stocks... ELF got what they wanted at the end
2080 2018-09-16 16:36:26 sm really be acting fools when they could have increased their stocks by atleast 20%
2081 2018-09-16 16:36:21 FedEx can pick up a package in Europe at 5 p.m. and have it delivered in Seattle by 10:30 the next morning. I buy and sell stocks from my phone. Amazon has same-day deliveries. But Elrod can't believe that women can put together a letter in 24 hours.
2082 2018-09-16 16:36:03 They know what they are doing if they are banking big. Managing a hedge fund is a different game that requires large capital to work with. These guys take advantage of the lesser known, more volatile stocks, play by their rules and go in for a quick profit most of the time.

2084 2018-09-16 16:33:13 I saw SM's timetable for their artists comeback and they just drop NCT 127's teaser skipping EXO. And so their stocks went down down baby.

2092 2018-09-16 16:27:56 exols reporting on sm stocks falling down lmao tis what u get for playing with us the fools @SMTOWNGLOBAL
2093 2018-09-16 16:27:55 C'est par ce qu'on avait écoulé tous nos stocks 
2094 2018-09-16 16:27:40 I mean they dropped a teaser for their group which means they have a comeback should'nt the stocks go up instead of dropping...
2095 2018-09-16 16:27:36 Complete BS. Regular cigarettes kill 480k US citizens and no call to stop the death? Big Tobacco stocks up 20 billion in last 3 days?  Smoke, tar and carcinogens kill. Nicotine does not...ever. More government lies promoted by the dumbshits at the times. 
2096 2018-09-16 16:27:05 is sm trying to compete with cube on who's stocks drops faster 
2097 2018-09-16 16:27:04 That's correct Kat and only while stocks last.
2098 2018-09-16 16:26:50 it's funny how when sm released a statement that exo was filming their comeback mv, their stocks showed a huge increase but now that they dropped nct127's comeback teaser before exo's, contradicting the timeline they posted, their stocks suddenly dropped ahshxhs
2099 2018-09-16 16:26:48 i dont understand why sm stocks drop?? is that something to do with exo??
2100 2018-09-16 16:26:16 This is why we (EXO-Ls) should buy SM stocks and become shareholders so then we can threaten SM about a lot of things... just like ELF did in the past.

2109 2018-09-16 16:22:53 You have repeatedly voted to end the ACA and mental health protection. You voted to remove mental health restrictions from gun purchases & voted against universal background checks. We need all these and a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks & hi cap ammo.
2110 2018-09-16 16:22:10 maybe miss kokobop was really trying to tell us something other than getting high on candy. maybe miss kokobop was really predicting there would be no cb in 2018 and sm's stocks would be going down. miss kokobop really tried to warn us but we didn't listen.
2111 2018-09-16 16:22:08 Wasn’t one for the spectators but a 6-3 win against the veterans in a friendly today. Was always going to be hard with 8 players missing but a win’s a win.

2115 2018-09-16 16:20:39 the stocks from 8/14 not today
2116 2018-09-16 16:19:22 I hope @SMTOWNGLOBAL 's stocks will go down until the pits of hell so that they will understand just how important EXO is. Erie, do sell your stocks, it's about to go down.
2117 2018-09-16 16:19:12 Keep dropping stocks yo. 
2118 2018-09-16 16:18:45 LOL. Yea that % drop was much more significant for Cube cuz their stocks aren’t worth as much but it’s barely a dent for SM
2119 2018-09-16 16:18:23 "Don’t believe your stocks; believe your stops"
2120 2018-09-16 16:17:33 Hmm now people like to look at the company's stocks huh
2121 2018-09-16 16:17:18 not even gonna pretend i know what stocks are
2122 2018-09-16 16:17:18 does any1 here actually kno how stocks work orrrrr
2123 2018-09-16 16:17:09 Sm’s stocks are going down that’s so sad alexa play kokobop
2124 2018-09-16 16:16:59 So probably EXO will perform kokobop until new EXO-ls raise new EXO-Ls. That might be the reason why SM's stocks go down down babyit goes down down baby.
2125 2018-09-16 16:16:59 We asked you to drop exo comeback info not your stocks... SM sweetie....
2126 2018-09-16 16:16:51 ...unfair on the other members if we fished to our hearts content while they couldn't. The restriction on fishing is also there to maintain stocks for the future, and most of the fish we catch are exported to the EU (we also import fish that other countries catch).
2127 2018-09-16 16:16:32 Lmaoo the stocks dropped. I hope they continue to drop.

2138 2018-09-16 16:13:06 Yes. You buy and sell them according to the changing value of the stocks.
2139 2018-09-16 16:12:59 SM Legit came from having their highest stocks of the year because it was announced that EXO were filming their MV but the moment they drop a teaser we didn’t expect, their stocks drop
2140 2018-09-16 16:12:57 Time to trade stocks on Monday!
2141 2018-09-16 16:12:23 I’m certain you lot know nothing about stocks and the drop has nothing to do with you guys thinking you’ll get cb news
2142 2018-09-16 16:12:16 @SMTOWNGLOBAL your stocks are going down down baby~ 
2143 2018-09-16 16:12:08 SM should not have released a timeline after all. It was a total fail. I love NCT too, but they're supposed to comeback after EXO so dropping something when they haven't released any EXO related comeback info is a wrong move. Now watch your stocks go down @SMTOWNGLOBAL
2144 2018-09-16 16:12:01 kind of ironic how SM had their highest stock value all year when it was announced that EXO were filming for a comeback opposed to now when stocks are dropping again bc SM haven’t released a teaser for EXO..... the kings are really that powerful 
2145 2018-09-16 16:11:44 SM stocks jatuh menjunam??

SM announced someone else's comeback, their stocks drop.
2189 2018-09-16 16:03:35 Sm's stocks are dropping after they released anothers groups teaser instead of EXO's lmao karma
2190 2018-09-16 16:03:23 So holding an indusrty accountable for actions that are out of their control is not how you do this. You hold those accountable that are selling or giving these products to teens. We are at a lose lose situation. Meanwhile bug tobacco stocks go through the roof. Hmm fishy fishy.

2220 2018-09-16 15:59:34 To answer your question: the expected return for bitcoin is much much much much higher than the expected return for stocks. Especially at current valuation levels. Useful to have both though

2226 2018-09-16 15:59:06 Not sure how much clearer I can make it for you, You were claiming a risk reward that for anyone that trades higher priced stocks just isn't factual. If they're trading like that, it's not anyone in at Trick Trades, because that's not how Pat teaches.
2227 2018-09-16 15:59:00 wait sm stocks are dropping?

2230 2018-09-16 15:58:47 Ok let me rephrase. AR-15 is no different than my Ruger 10/22 rabbit gun that is accurate from 50 to 150 yards. 
Except that the AR looks scary. 
You have an issue with bump stocks and that is a legit argument. 
Although they need human help to kill anyone

2255 2018-09-16 15:55:49 Got a chance to talk w/ the financial adviser of BPI about investments & insurance. Well, I might have to consider investing in stocks now. Better have an early investment than having it 10 years after.

2262 2018-09-16 15:54:15 From a contrarian perspective, you are absolutely right

The extreme bearishness in $VIX became bullish for stocks from Options Market Maker's perspective, who would do everything to make sure these VIX calls expiring worthless by pumping stocks. But, manipulation won't last long

2271 2018-09-16 15:52:30 What part is false? The 1.6% GDP growth in 2016 or central banks pumping trillions of dollars into markets pushing interest rates near zero and investors farther out the risk curve into stocks?
2272 2018-09-16 15:52:26 SM stocks drop
2273 2018-09-16 15:52:16 I loaded heavily into #Gold stocks anticipating a move that is yet to happen. Had to scale back some positions, took some losses.

Different scenario with #Oil & #Gas. The commodity has significantly moved & there are several producers out there with a growth value disconnect.
2274 2018-09-16 15:51:32 ada yang bilang "sm stocks is dropping"
2275 2018-09-16 15:51:31 SM have to give us some soft of news at the 6pm news now, otherwise their stocks will drop more omfg

2279 2018-09-16 15:49:59 1/2; Well then I don’t know where your getting your information from because that “conman” has unemployment here in the US at a historic lows <4.5%, stocks are averaging around 20-25%. As opposed to 6-8%, health insurance cost has dropped about 50% ...the list goes on!  See next.
2280 2018-09-16 15:49:47 Of course, and make the public bail out the big companies -financial companies who have heated up the stocks..privatize profits, socialize losses
2281 2018-09-16 15:47:44 Tax cuts for the rich allowed companies to buy back stocks and inflate the market, when it crashes its all on the jackass in the WH
2282 2018-09-16 15:46:42 5. People who trade in stocks (you know, the elite) don't think the boycott will do much.
2283 2018-09-16 15:46:08 Hi Stella, some stores are stocking them right now! The official date, I believe, is the 19th. If you let me know your postcode I'll see if any stores near you stocks them. :) Thanks -Sharon

2287 2018-09-16 15:40:53 How many times have you wanted to buy a stock that doesn't dip so you just stop watching? And then weeks/months/years later you look and it's up huge from that first notice... Good stocks are hard to buy and deserve your attention even if it takes forever to buy where you want it

2290 2018-09-16 15:39:31 America at crossroads. Will the affluent be smart this time? Than in Russia, France, China, Germany. We hope but doubt.
GDP grew 10 X person income. Person worth grew 40% below stocks.
Wealthy, robber exec's of vampire corp's, sold politicos, deep state. Fat and protected FOR NOW
2291 2018-09-16 15:38:46 But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That’s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007.

2299 2018-09-16 15:33:48 1.  Those who put in their own money into stocks lost. 
2. GM sold to non American company- stock payers still lost
3. Foreign company moved jobs to China

2301 2018-09-16 15:32:20 it's not about mass producing, but their stocks are pretty limited yet demands are high. It's as if they're still afraid of marketing it, selling on regular merchants. They're pretty bad on marketing.
2302 2018-09-16 15:32:17 Couple days off, time to get back in the gym today and put this work in. All about improvement, got big goals and they won't be easy, but then if they were, probably wouldn't be good goals.

2308 2018-09-16 15:27:59 Punditry members all have stock holdings and are getting richer.
The rest of us are in debt to banks and other companies with soaring stocks,
We're watching interest rates go up,
watching prices go up from tariffs, 
BUT wages remain all-but-flat, 
So we can't pay our bills.

2310 2018-09-16 15:27:32 The same could be said of the EU fishermen who raid British fish stocks. Surprise surprise, the French don't want to play by the rules and would rather break the law. We'll be back to burning sheep alive before we know it.
2311 2018-09-16 15:25:15 Sirji can you recommend few names for chemicals and polymer stocks.
2312 2018-09-16 15:24:50 ah thanks for the info =) .  i was always curious what happens even on stocks..
2313 2018-09-16 15:24:47 There are many, they usually don't invest in penny stocks although. Generally that's considered the domain for idiots/scam artists.
2314 2018-09-16 15:23:06 Oui c'était sur des stocks d'armes chimiques

2317 2018-09-16 15:21:02 Yep I made those black&white stocks
2318 2018-09-16 15:20:56 It’s because the president equates stock market with overall economy. Meanwhile most people don’t have stocks. Yes there are jobs but they are not paying more money. It’s really the okie dokie he’s playing.
2319 2018-09-16 15:19:54 Ive never heard anyone say "buy the news", its always sell. I think Bakkt being build is an extremely good development for bitcoin fundamentals, but I see the BTC market as asleep. Why invest in an asset that looks that bad on a chart when you can make a killing with stocks?
2320 2018-09-16 15:17:16 Easy. Swipe right. It became so ubiquitous that even @RobinhoodApp uses it. From dating to buying stocks
2321 2018-09-16 15:16:39 Right. Didn’t Uptick rule On Shorting stocks changed about the same time fasb put mark to market in? Always strange coincidence to me.
2322 2018-09-16 15:14:38 Might get away with putting them in stocks !!!

2325 2018-09-16 15:13:04 Lol. The economy is separate from stocks.

Who is the fool?
2326 2018-09-16 15:12:50 Probably from that $1.5 Trillion dollars GOP gave billionaires which they invested, not in jobs or growth but instead into their own stock. Which falsely inflates their companies value. But don't worry billionaires know to sell before stocks begin to crash on the working class

2333 2018-09-16 15:08:29 Its great to have smart investor friends in a stock with you. Often, I read an NR and miss one word that totally changes the materiality of the news. Having a friend to chat with can really help your comprehension of newsflow. #stocks #microcaps #smallcaps #potstocks
2334 2018-09-16 15:07:56 The issue I have is he consistently picks terrible stocks that underperform. $FTSI.N, $CJ.N, $TCW, $SHLE, $SLCA.N, $SPE are a few. I don't think those three are terrible picks, but so many better choices in Canadian O&G. The low beta plays he doesn't like have performed the best.
2335 2018-09-16 15:07:37 I've always thought it was an interesting coincidence that depletion of stocks was reported so close to the referendum!

2347 2018-09-16 15:01:44 While this is true, consumer confidence in Trump economy is also pushing stocks up, so he deserves some credit. Meanwhile, Brandon McManus in thin air against a weak defense is a good investment regardless of economic policy.
2348 2018-09-16 15:01:40 Yep rare tlaga siya eh lalo na dito tsaka matagal production so if ever may mag benta ng stocks baka end of the year or next year pa gjdjdkkd good luck sa atinn
2349 2018-09-16 15:01:16 I am disappointed in @GlobalEdmonton. They added multiple items to their screen on weekdays. Anchors, stocks, weather, traffic & ads all at the same time. It was so crowded that you couldn't see anything. I complained & only watched on weekends. Now they have ruined it as well.

2352 2018-09-16 14:57:32 I don't believe in climate change it's just a way for people to get rich on by the people buying stocks and buying electric cars which they have something to do with the money.
2353 2018-09-16 14:56:31 The lesson in HTMMIS that most overlook is the importance of constantly studying historical winners.  Start with some charts like $nvda and take it bar by bar.  identify buy points. etc... do that for a few 100 stocks and you'll have a great framework for a system.
2354 2018-09-16 14:54:41 Odds of winning is 1 in 14,000,000, that's less than 1% of 1% of 1% or 0.0001

2367 2018-09-16 14:42:48 Almost a year ago, a white guy gunned down 58 and injured over 500 people, yet still no legislation on bump stocks, which NO ONE needs. You’ve done nothing. So respectfully STFU about it not being about the shooter.
2368 2018-09-16 14:42:22 Does this mean I can stop buying huge bandaids to put on my heels before I workout? Son-of-a-biscuit! If this works stocks for Walgreens is gonna’ fall!

A) plumbing
B) investing in stocks 

I'd have to say B).
2375 2018-09-16 14:35:36 That's the fault of the politicians who weren't honest about the Common Market. Regardless, the fisherman were overfishing and fishing stocks were rapidly decreasing. Thanks to the EU fishing stocks are back on again.
2376 2018-09-16 14:35:27 No I would not and your analogy is fit for some, but the fine line here with college players is properly assessing their play. Some say they’re kids & don’t want to be too critical. The angst comes from expectations given by media about a special team & then BYU happens.

2378 2018-09-16 14:26:19 @PocophoneGlobal today i want to buy #POCOPHONEF1 on offline mi store in Medan, Indonesia. But after asking the sales, they don’t have stocks anymore.

2380 2018-09-16 14:25:54 They are called military assault weapons for a reason. And bump stocks are only useful for hurting masses of people- NOT HUNTING unless you are a sadistic poacher

2383 2018-09-16 14:24:27 Will stocks sell off tomorrow? Or will mystery money be put back into the bonds market? 10 year at 3%
2384 2018-09-16 14:24:26 I love the “we suffered through 8 years of Obama” bullshit. You suffered as stocks went from 7k to 18k? Unemployment went from 9.9 to 4? When he saved the housing market and GM? Admit it. You suffered through seeing a black man in the White House.
2385 2018-09-16 14:22:27 There was a piece recently in Bloomberg about tech retail stocks being as high as they were just before the dot com crash. I believe it
2386 2018-09-16 14:21:50 Axis bank is consolidating between 620 -680. We need to wait which way it breaks then one should initiate positions.
2387 2018-09-16 14:21:48 not really, you want stockholders. The problem with stock buybacks is it only puts more money in the super wealthy and only manipulates the stocks.  and the money used to buy those stocks back is money a business can give their workers.

"Are you sure you can handle more?" Baekhyun asks, lifting an eyebrow at the yawning boss.

2393 2018-09-16 14:17:34 It was an accurate depiction of what happens in these circumstances. One L + lament by some/too many is season is over. If you were part of a team -- sports or otherwise -- and a teammate quit at first sign of adversity would you want that person around?
2394 2018-09-16 14:16:11 Even the Great Recession didn’t really touch those affluent with lots of stocks. Just hanging on turned temporary paper loses into today’s magnificent gains

2405 2018-09-16 14:11:16 @NigelSlater please help a girl out. I deeply regret not bringing an Indonesian pestle & mortar back from Bali. Your friend Bobby used one on Eating Together - is there anywhere in Leicester/London stocks them? I've searched online & even asked about shipping one in, to no avail.
2406 2018-09-16 14:10:51 Im buying lemon stocks Asap.
2407 2018-09-16 14:10:45 The response was your jab at the fan base. Weak enough to throw in the towel. I don’t have an issue in what you do but you continue to dismiss the poor decision making by the QB. His poor play puts pressure on every other facet of team to be perfect.
2408 2018-09-16 14:06:23 Im telling yall to i was supposed to be at the white house when Obama was in office im suppose to be meeting up with other countries to about oil deals to because im the owner of oil and gas chewing gum tar i have tied in accomplishment with the railroads to stocks to
2409 2018-09-16 14:05:52 No idea how Hornibrook's quote elicited that response, which had zero to do w/topic he addressed. He was talking about a mindset, how players should deal with a defeat on 9/15. I'm OK with a 9-3 record? Not relevant but please cite when I wrote/said that.
2410 2018-09-16 14:05:30 The bigger the company, the less you can trust them. Google crossed that threshold decades ago. This is also a good philosophy to take when investing in stocks or shares.
2411 2018-09-16 14:05:06 S&P 500 Maintains Solid Trend, Can the DAX and FTSE Follow Higher?: U.S. stocks continue to look poised for higher prices, can the DAX and FTSE find their footing and feed of strength in the world’s largest stock market?
2412 2018-09-16 14:04:42 It is obvious you didn't invest in stocks and bonds during obamas presidency! Otherwise you would know you barely made any interest gains on your money!

2416 2018-09-16 14:00:32 Meanwhile, Nike stocks continue to rise. Good choice, Nike. Will buy more!
2417 2018-09-16 14:00:15 Real estate gains like stocks only apply when you sell and you still need a place to live. And then your kids and grandkids can’t afford housing costs.
2418 2018-09-16 13:59:09 What in the hell in the first 3 games suggests that this team is special? Offense is limited because of the QB. The defense is young and lacks depth. The OL seems to be struggling. You’re ok with a 9-3 record because you report on team. Alumni & fan base wanted more from program.
2419 2018-09-16 13:56:52 there will be a queue online? i thought online shopping was easy. unless they purposely make less stocks this time. tsk

2430 2018-09-16 13:49:45 renmin stocks reached an all-time high today but show no signs of slowing down, they've grown exponentially in 2018 and analysts predict further increases in value in the near future. despite some hiccups, early investors in renmin are now reaping triple what they've invested.
2431 2018-09-16 13:49:30 @kairyssdal ..But isn't the ability to raise money by selling stock one of the benefits of being a publicly held company?  Couldn't they, in theory, sell more stocks in the future if they wanted to make those investments?  Ignorance speaking here - trying to understand. Thanks.
2432 2018-09-16 13:48:22 @kairyssdal In the the recent Make Me Smart podcast with Lenore Palladino, a point was made that once companies have spent their money to buy back stocks, it's gone and therefore the opportunity to invest it in their product, facilities or people.  con't..

2447 2018-09-16 13:38:29 The economic recovery had been ongoing for 7 years. Trump inherited a good economy. I don't disagree with Trump on everything.  But saying his policies have not had much Chance to take traction. I pulled my money out of stocks last month. So you know what I think.
2448 2018-09-16 13:38:26 Would you really feel comfortable with 50% of assets in stocks and real estate at these prices? I know that I wouldn't and I sure as heck would not recommend 25% in Bitcoin to someone with that risk tolerance/time horizon.
2449 2018-09-16 13:37:33 Shouldn't you be holding the stocks of tickets until after #Brexit? Just in case? Chicken Licking says the sky is going to fall.... which is about as good an economic indicator as the others!

2451 2018-09-16 13:34:52 Any single stock is also trivially a constantly rebalanced portfolio, OED. The catch is that in the very long run, beating the best-performing stock is actually not that great an achievemeny, as all stocks disappear eventually.

2461 2018-09-16 13:26:50 Trading and monitoring stocks is similar to running a business in that if we get too caught up in the day-to-day activities, we sometimes forget to look at the big picture. Don't  forget to take a step back, look, and reassess.
2462 2018-09-16 13:25:52 Yea I’d say that or stocks. But safer stocks that don’t require much management. ETFs. Maybe even sector ETFs. Water ETFs. Hedge against market with some Gold and Silver too

2476 2018-09-16 13:12:19 I wonder if falling house prices will be good or bad for stocks. Could be that there will be some forced stock selling if/when household budgets get squeezed further. Or alternatively money flows away from property & into stocks, especially given they are a much more liquid asset

2488 2018-09-16 13:01:44 I have so few stocks of some of my merch for cosmania and im too insecure to restock them I just want them all gone
2489 2018-09-16 13:01:11 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.
2490 2018-09-16 13:00:07 Thanks for that, I'll see if the Iceland where I am stocks them. Sainsbury's has some new vegan carmalised onion and mushroom sausages that are delicious!
2491 2018-09-16 12:59:24 No.  I agree.  I used Amzn's services long before I started working here.  Low stress, living wage, good benefits, an employee discount (cuz I still shop quite a bit), monthly bonuses and Co stocks makes for a pretty #HappyAmazonian

2494 2018-09-16 12:56:27 I've worked here for almost 2yrs and I get paid very well. I'm able to take care of my wife and kids and maintain my hobbies. Full-time employees make on average $15/hr. With stocks in the company and bounces.  I'm glad to be here, because my past jobs did not pay me well at all/
2495 2018-09-16 12:54:35 I’ve done an inventory of my empty beer bottles and have at least twelve crates. The downside is that beer stocks are perilously low #homebrew

2499 2018-09-16 12:51:29 Fully agree BB, I expect a sector-wide correction first Q after legalization. That’s when we’ll differentiate fugazzi stocks and future leaders. As for $LG, the only thing you can do is invest on the management. Just look at David Lenigas track record...terrible

2501 2018-09-16 12:48:03 Syrup-misers were the reason the stocks were invented, and I suggest we bring them back, if only as a Dire Warning. Ain't no excuse for that kind of bull puckey in a civlised society
2502 2018-09-16 12:47:22 Stocks plunged right after Brexit happened, many companies left your country and settled down mostly in Europe to benefit from us, both the Euro and pound fell and the second one will most likely go deeper down . The list is endless, I couldn’t write all of them on here.
2503 2018-09-16 12:47:13 Can the super surge in “dividend” stocks cause a bubble?
In addition the new passiv investment mania, not to forget the dividend ETFs.

2506 2018-09-16 12:45:20 What is your general process for sifting through the 500 stocks that come up on your scan? Are you looking for specific kinds of setups, etc? Thanks!
2507 2018-09-16 12:43:13 oh, ya. it's MOE stock !! it's right.

2518 2018-09-16 12:36:21 In korea, they only look at it from a trade by trade perspective. So it doesnt matter if in 100 trades u r net even. If you made profits in 50 trades that will be taxed. Thats how it works for stocks. No laws yet for crypto
2519 2018-09-16 12:36:20 It's hard to live in the USA on $20,000 a year.

Based on what you have shared at $7.75 to $10.00 an hour working at McDonald's you will be living well below the poverty level.

So, w/ social security, a 401k & stocks you better hope your investments will yield enough 4 u 2 live.

2538 2018-09-16 12:09:09 @SagarRV1 what do you think about sugar stocks in India. Most of them have very good cash flows but yet trading at a very low market cap.

2541 2018-09-16 12:07:00 I have always been treated with respect here in the FC.  As a FT associate, full benefits are part of the standard compensation/benefits package.  It also includes monthly bonuses and Co stocks.  Biannual raises for 2 years.  4 day work weeks.   A schedule that fits my life needs
2542 2018-09-16 12:06:24 Limits are placed to protect dwindling fish stocks. It’s. It rocket science. If you over fish you lose years of supply and people lose jobs. Not the fat cat bosses but the employees.
2543 2018-09-16 12:04:35 Or I just give those stocks away. Again. No one buys and they collect dusts.
2544 2018-09-16 12:03:21 i meant more daytrading than long term investing in stocks.

investing in stocks is more akin to my sound bite "being selfish with other peoples work".

Daytrading and high frequency trading do not care at all about the value of the company it is just another chart.
2545 2018-09-16 12:03:00 We actually start with a fair wage, here at BFI4.  Raises 2x a year for 2 years.  Monthly incentive bonuses.  Full benefits.  Stocks.  Plenty of opps to promote and improve our base wage that much more.
2546 2018-09-16 12:00:20 On 10th anniversary of the Lehman bankruptcy, this is how stocks closed on that day:

Business channels do that all the time
At peak recession, they send the gloomiest/ oldies to back office and put fresh faces on prime time

Btw, am not buying company. I am just buying minority shares. Hav seen such scenario play out in my London stocks & how minority got screwed who bought this premise
2554 2018-09-16 11:54:57 Also, investing in stocks isn't just clicking buttons on a PC. When you buy a stock, you're contributing to the value of a company. If the market believes a company is producing good stuff, then the ones investing in it are actively helping them grow even more.
2555 2018-09-16 11:54:27 It's not going to be so low as there have been positive run in few large cap stocks.
Secondly they have to start somewhere and as market returns catch up so will LTCG in coming years...
2556 2018-09-16 11:54:04 One “regulating” objective has to be incentives for C-Suite private sector roles to act for long-term growth and stability, rather than quarter-to-quarter rewards in stocks and other fancy comp models paying them for strategies that hurt sustainability.

2567 2018-09-16 11:46:15 I’m aware of the outcry from stockholders regarding the stocks poor own performance, And that their prime free shipping has been the primary leader of profits there since that was created.
2568 2018-09-16 11:44:49 Pharma seems to be entered strong upside. These stocks will surprise. Sunpharma, lupin, auropharma, ajantha pharma, natco are some good picks. Dollar appreciation is positive as well.
2569 2018-09-16 11:43:27 Amazon has run very narrow profit margins and has lacked profit for many years. They’re swinging from profitless into profitable quarter occasionally but even then profits are slim. The stocks do not produce any income as AMZN pays no dividends.

2571 2018-09-16 11:41:18 I think the big issue is that Amazon profits were being highlighted and Mr. Bezos’ tremendous income from stocks was being highlighted while miserable conditions for his workers making him the money were simultaneously coming to light. It made for a volatile mix
2572 2018-09-16 11:41:15 Was so excited to hear about this, however £7.99 delivery is rayt expensive. Do you anywhere in Derby that stocks the cans?

2578 2018-09-16 11:33:35 Maybe we can ask @DOF_PH and @SecSonnySays about it sir, i heard they have issues about the contract. I am excited about the New Manila International Airport and I bet others too have the same feeling. ofws (incl. myself), can share if they will open it thru bonds/stocks perhaps.
2579 2018-09-16 11:32:25 Amazon vend comme les autres, a ses stocks de marchandise comme les autres ; mais l'entreprise est trop puissante par rapport aux librairie (elle ne demandent pratiquement pas de frais de ports, contrairement aux libraires tradi).
2580 2018-09-16 11:31:02 Súper buena empresa . Cada vez que la veo más me arrepiento de haberla vendido 
2581 2018-09-16 11:30:24 It's not luck Nick if you have rules. One of my most successful trade patterns is buying in the money puts on high flying stocks. Timing is key. Price action targets is also key. In the last month TLRY has been a fantastic money maker for me on both the long and short side.
2582 2018-09-16 11:29:30 C'est simple à justifier :

2618 2018-09-16 10:27:48 Getting twenty 1 mark questions and ten 2 mark questions right is equivalent to getting two 20 mark questions right.
Likewise, get your highly-allocated stock in your PF right, instead of sweating it out on thirty less-allocated stocks.

2622 2018-09-16 10:26:06 Which correlation? What lag, what period? In 2017 the 120-day correlation between $BTC and $SPY was > 0.20. Stocks up, bitcoin up. Only recently inverse correlation.  #crypto is for extreme speculation, not diversification as correlations are dynamic and change constantly.

2641 2018-09-16 10:05:59 Flixton 6-0 from two overs. Stocks has a nibble at a wide one after almost chopping on earlier in the over.
2642 2018-09-16 10:05:00 I'm sorry.  Are you speaking for all Amazonians?  Or just the ones you KNOW?  I know quite a few people that do not need any public assistance to maintain their daily lives.  Full benefits, living wage, biannual raises, monthly bonus, Co stocks, promotions, restrooms and breaks.

2653 2018-09-16 09:56:34 About is that these stocks BuyBacks are probably the biggest reason why the Stock Market is at record highs, since BuyBacks are also at a record, twice as big as the old one. 
And money does partly go into economy. Biggest sellers to the companies are insiders, who decided the -

2657 2018-09-16 09:54:09 I think this paper is very important because it reminds us that  our local B73 stocks can be very different from the reference sequence. We have to keep that in mind when thinking about controls for our genetic experiments.
2658 2018-09-16 09:53:27 @FandFCC have chased in every round of the National Village thus far, but they bat first today in the final.

2661 2018-09-16 09:45:27 I do feel "owned".The same way Dicks sporting goods and Nike feel owned as they watch their stocks and profits increase.
2662 2018-09-16 09:45:00 I am thinking people like Liz here, who profited by living a very privileged life after her daddy made millions out if stocks by sending young men and women to die in a war paid by taxpayers, should probably go into a whole and not express her stupid opinions publicly.
2663 2018-09-16 09:44:59 Hahaha... I think all of us who look at breakout charts or follow price are chasing similar stocks. :)

Dislike Chamberlain and Nichols. Umpiring stocks are in the sewer if either of these two get a prelim.   Too many mistakes at crucial times.
2670 2018-09-16 09:33:16 For those who asked me regarding stock sale for Peachbomb’s slogans, the fansite has replied me and said that she MIGHT have some stocks left and will contact me if she decides to do a stock sale. If she does a stock sale, I will be doing a GO for her.
2671 2018-09-16 09:33:09 Wouldn’t recommend Gina, these stocks are at ATH’s like most US stocks. When Fed raises interests rates I wouldn’t be surprised at all in 2008 happened all over again.

2711 2018-09-16 08:28:31 Certainly many Option Writers benefit from such an analysis. But there are an equal number who do well without it. They may sell Options in Stocks that dont show up on the TA's radar based on other criteria. The universe is very large.

2713 2018-09-16 08:25:56 It is truly amazing how many people replied with what ifs and the perfect scenario. What if the ICO skyrocketed and you went to $1mil, then you put it $SCRL for the 1 good month and took it to $10mil, then x100 leveraged cannabis stocks in August. You'd have $1 trillion. Loser
2714 2018-09-16 08:21:35 If you're buying stocks that are $80 a share and expect to make a good profit you probably shouldn't be doing stocks

But the market crash factor is invisible...

Yet the crash is inevitable, impending and stressful.
Politicians, economists and traders are all holding their breath.
The storm is coming!

2741 2018-09-16 07:43:42 $TEVA and $OPK trading in the homeland. 

What amuses them (all have $TWTR accounts) is how astonished Americans are over the self-dealing charges and cross investments in crapper penny stocks. This is biz du jour in Canada, LatAm, Japan, China, Korea, and Israel.

2742 2018-09-16 07:42:44 True Sir . I gained handsomely in the first 3 years of my investment career as I had bought quality stocks in 2013 but didn’t did anything to control my temperament.

2797 2018-09-16 06:05:51 I would rather have the innovative leader, he has always been, than a "boss."  Our starting wage is a FAIR wage.  Biannual raises/monthly bonus/full benefits/co stocks. It's really up to the individual after they get hired to improve their standing w/Amzn thus improv the wages.
2798 2018-09-16 06:04:00 I work at Amazon and I earn a living wage.  Full benefits.  Co stocks.  Monthly bonus.  Biannual raises.  Employee discount.  Opportunities to improve my skills and promote.  Work-life cycle. Both PTO & UPT.  Voluntary OT.  3 day weekends.  And an amazing team to work with.

2837 2018-09-16 04:56:00 I make a livable wage and FULL benefits that I enrolled in DAY1.  I make more than enough to take care of my wants and needs.  My family is taken care of and I do not receive the help of a single govt program.  I do get a monthly bonus, biannual raises and co stocks though.

2857 2018-09-16 04:28:25 Borrowing a trillion dollars with interest and giving it to rich people to by back stocks is not fixing the economy, it's a short lived drunken party for stupid, greedy, rich ppl to take advantage of hard working people. It's a disastrous, unsustainable redistribution of weath.
2858 2018-09-16 04:21:59 Also pump and dump, promoting own stocks on media, celebrity investors ...
2859 2018-09-16 04:16:46 ISIS defeated. No countries invaded. Economy booming, energy sector booming, stocks way up. Not Not bad for a "fake president." Eben your loser narcissist Obama is trying to claim he caused the Trump boom.
2860 2018-09-16 04:16:10 Twitter is rampant with ppl with a tag of 'value' or 'equity' in their Twitter-handles peddling/pumping stocks! Have been unfollowing such idiots over last 3 months.
2861 2018-09-16 04:15:44 their stocks will rise bc of u
2862 2018-09-16 04:13:48 Gusto ko yan hahaha! Alam mo ba usapan sa office namin lagi yang mga stocks stocks  kaso wala talaga akong idea pano nagwwork so nattakot ako baka malugi hahahaha
2863 2018-09-16 04:13:01 I hate serious conversation MFers when I’m drunk.. like bruh/sis we just took 2 shots of Rumplemintz.. I’m not trying to talk about Trump, the ozone, stocks, and shit lol
2864 2018-09-16 04:12:48 It appears only a very small subset of folks care about either of these. If people feared internet surveillance, GAFA stocks wouldn't be so robust to privacy-related shocks. And for folks who don't have tons of $, it's relatively easy to trust retail banks in places like America.

2872 2018-09-16 04:04:25 You obviously never owned stocks or you would know that is an out right lie. The market has never been as good as it has been under President Trump. All Obama did was try to pump money out with his bailouts that didn't do squat. Obama is a POS.

2900 2018-09-16 03:29:29 I believe U stocks will be one the quickest to bounce though, as most of the buyers are goverments n major utilities that have to supply power to the people..
If China continue their construction of Nuclear power then I believe the case is still intact for a massive Uranium bull!
2901 2018-09-16 03:29:25 Hows the roads and bridges lacking funding and education system failing and a burgeoning deficit and a attack on health care causing 30% higher premiums helping that winning? Yeah everyone is winning lol. Just how much is that 401k and stocks up for ya?
2902 2018-09-16 03:28:42 Like all stocks in the GFC, U stocks went also down. 
They were just coming off a massive bull run though.
I think a major correction is very close (this year) and all stocks include U will suffer.

2907 2018-09-16 03:21:19 There focus is mainly on illiquid stocks.
2908 2018-09-16 03:19:44 As I keep reading the business and financial news, I become more and more conscious of the negativity of the press. Everything is about market crashes, financial crises, and depressions. Yet, the economy is booming, earnings and stocks are soaring. Baffled by the bias but bullish

2910 2018-09-16 03:19:02 The cost of learning tends to be exponentially higher and hence people sway away. I think markets always makes 20% people quit after their early stint by making them believe that its all losing streaks and huge money will be lost. I had a worst experience choosing wrong stocks
2911 2018-09-16 03:17:19 now you guys are saying that it’s not the final decision. what the hell???? you realize you made a shit choice once your stocks flopped and now are going back on your words?? so disappointed. you can’t just ignore this and tweet like nothing happened.
2912 2018-09-16 03:17:00 It is not that hard of a concept to grasp. He does not have $163b in cash lying around. They are in stocks and bonds, mainly in his own company. If he decided to liquidate all of the money then that would make it worth less because their value is determined by shareholders.

2929 2018-09-16 02:48:24 Kid, if you think Obama failed you didn’t own stocks the last 10 yrs. He’s why I could retire early. I owned 4 businesses in my life. It’s a long term proposition, not a tax cut scam. You saps are always the last to get it. Long term he’s burying you. Watch. Better yet, learn.
2930 2018-09-16 02:47:28 You've done little more than feed cash, in the form of tax cuts, to corporations & the one-percenters so that they can binge-buyback their stocks. Adjusted for inflation, wages are flat or falling. Jobs are still being lost to automation. Your #StupidTradeWar hurts all Americans.

2960 2018-09-16 02:07:00 Screening is about REMOVING BAD apples, not finding good apples. 

If you buy stocks according to ONE extreme criteria (e.g. v. low P/E), you'll likely NOT find good apples. The low P/E was "bought" by worsening OTHER criteria. 

Much better to have WEAK filters on MANY criteria.

2978 2018-09-16 01:48:11 Your setting yourself up for disappointment if u think this 154 year old law will be fixed completely and make everyone happy by Nov 6.  What is the big deal with pfic? Mutual funds suck anyway. Sell them and buy stocks (mutuals are a mix of stock anyway) and your good.
2979 2018-09-16 01:46:31 buy some Nintendo stocks cause Nintendo Switch was the only unique game system and was going to sell like hotcakes... Anyway another big boxing match will happen at the end of the year between Deontay wilder and Tyson Fury.

2986 2018-09-16 01:37:42 @unemon1  gee. i guess you should have gone long $NIO instead.  shorting stocks is unpleasant when you get the timing wrong.
2987 2018-09-16 01:34:32 That's why CEOs are buying their stocks back. Because the stockholders are ducking them dry. The more stockholders who own stock in your business. The less your business makes. Since you have to pay all those investors.
2988 2018-09-16 01:33:46 It doesn’t seem too under siege when a guy can buy enough weapons and ammunition to fire 1100 rounds, killing 58 and injuring 851 Americans in say ... Nevada.  Do people really need bump stocks & tracer ammunition to protect themselves?  ...
2989 2018-09-16 01:32:24 The calm before the storm! Technically speaking- consolidation comes before a big move! But in which direction? Of the FANg stocks, there are a lot of weak hands in Googl
2990 2018-09-16 01:32:15 That game was at Lambeau
2991 2018-09-16 01:31:57 Our companies should be employee owned if possible.  Next their pensions should be in mid cap stocks largely domestic.  US should have a national strategy to be indifferent to the dow jones industrial average.
2992 2018-09-16 01:28:55 Nike Stocks Close at Record High Following Controversial Colin Kaepernick Endorsement
2993 2018-09-16 01:28:31 That's why CEO'S are buying their stocks back. The less stockholders that own stock in your business. The more capital your business has for product, inventory and the employees.
2994 2018-09-16 01:22:55 And you won't their stocks are trading at less than $2 on the stock market in Korea, they really messed themselves up here they don't have the stroke to do anything to her like an SM Entertainment or jyp could

3003 2018-09-16 01:12:00 Seriously? Lol you thought share holders would sell now? Seeing that the EPS calling is September 25th and they make that free money on each share. Lmfao You'll see the fire sale after that, lmfao dude has no clue on stocks..... #JokeIsOnYou
3004 2018-09-16 01:11:44 YES! Who cares about how good the stock market is doing when the vast majority of Americans dont own stocks!

3007 2018-09-16 01:10:42 People say: Numbers don’t lie. 

If you have a $100 stock go down 10% one year, you have $90.

If your $90 stock goes up 10% next year, you have $99.

Average Annual Rate of Return: 0%

You lose one dollar. 

Numbers lie.

3008 2018-09-16 01:05:29 I’m thinking about starting a podcast and I just signed up for my first invest through stocks and bonds. Let’s see where this adventure leads me!!!! 
3009 2018-09-16 01:04:05 Where do you actually get Pot Rice from? I’ve been looking for it everywhere and no one stocks it around here. 
3010 2018-09-16 01:03:36 PSA: if the setup crashes, freezes, or loses power during a tournament set, the rule in PM is apparently to start a new game with the same percents and stocks as before it happened. i feel like i just got cheated out of losers bracket holy fuck
3011 2018-09-16 01:01:17 Why don't you actually follow some of the stocks he posts here instead? Is that too complicated?
3012 2018-09-16 00:52:55 Remember when people were put in stocks for embarrassment.
3013 2018-09-16 00:51:52 Also, based on the comment boards, tons of investors in Canadian weed stocks are Americans. I can’t wrap my head around how this would work.
3014 2018-09-16 00:51:24 Yep, that Cat 1 hurricane makes that narritive seem a little silly al..your carbon tax stocks take a dip?  #followthemoney #psuedoscience

3016 2018-09-16 00:49:29 Took my gold out a few months after brexit vote to realise profits but then lost a bit on stocks.
3017 2018-09-16 00:47:40 Trying to figure out which stocks to buy like 
3018 2018-09-16 00:46:30 Is the economy good for everyone or just the top 1%? Data says no, Stocks are not owned by everyone. Why do you keep saying no collusion when many of your campaign officials have pled guilty?

3021 2018-09-16 00:44:49 I can understand the temptation. But stealing meat is a very serious crime. The theives should be put in stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables.
3022 2018-09-16 00:44:18 Its kinda funny how they suddenly said the decision wasn't final when their stocks dropped considerably. Hyuna made them money for so long, but I hope if they ask for her back she laughs in their faces and looks for another label. Edawn may not have a choice.
3023 2018-09-16 00:44:07 Does anybody know a pro audio shop in NYC that stocks replacement parts for the Adam Audio A8X (specifically tweeters)? Having a bit of an audio  emergency.

3025 2018-09-16 00:41:22 Got to play Smash Ultimate today. Tried out PT, Little Mac, and Pikachu. Honestly the game is faster in terms of movement and taking stocks but a majority of attacks felt really laggy (endlag) with different impact effects (think little mac smash attacks).
3026 2018-09-16 00:40:57 You are lying once again the economy is good for the 3% not everyone has money stocked away in stocks and the Russian investigation is revealing just how many of those who were in your camp was playing footsie with Russia, and that includes you too.
3027 2018-09-16 00:40:26 I made some good investments this year. Lol bought a lot of material shit. Started a IRA, 403b & invested in some stocks.  Next step credit and school.
3028 2018-09-16 00:40:00 So, a FAIR wage, biannual raises/2 years, full benefits, monthly bonuses, Co stocks, uninterrupted meal/rest periods, opportunities to promote, higher education prog, mentors, skill building (like interviewing/resume writing) classes, climate controlled, filtered water stations..
3029 2018-09-16 00:38:55 I actually believe btc has yet to show any real correlation to anything. hope it's true because when stocks crash and BTc doesn't give a fuck...look out
3030 2018-09-16 00:38:27 Number 5 should be called Bitcoin
Your list should include less items because FIAT its not an long term investment... 
When things change and you must rebalance the portfolio you will have very few liquidity to be hable to exchange stocks, bonds, real estate, ETF... before it
3031 2018-09-16 00:35:30 A market is defined as the sum total of all the buyers and sellers in the area.
Human behavior is invariable that why history keeps repeating over and over again. I think that stocks market and cryptocurrency market are the same in some way.
3032 2018-09-16 00:34:24 Just to many to say but,  the economy is so much better,  stocks have become more competitive,  retired citizens got a cost of living raise, something pos Obama did not do for 3 years straight. Etc. A/H
3033 2018-09-16 00:31:34 not true there stocks went down right away and more people are getting rid of there stocks.
3034 2018-09-16 00:30:57 Fuck stocks. Invest into crypto.
3035 2018-09-16 00:30:30 Teachers, doctors + nurses, locksmiths...disarm them back to WW1', iron tight regular inspections of weapon stocks to prevent them from producing, hoarding + modernising illegally, global ban on nuclear weapons, explosives from air, land + seamines, hand granted asf being
3036 2018-09-16 00:30:00 Ok, well, I'm here to tell you that I make a living wage in an Amazon FC.  Full benefits.  Encouraging atmosphere that embraces promoting from within.  Monthly variable bonuses (so when the FC does good, it reflects in my bonus), Co stocks.  Mentors and higher education prog.
3037 2018-09-16 00:28:16 Cube: We are removing Hyuna and E'Dawn from the company due to lack of trust.

3038 2018-09-16 00:26:54 @TradeWithNinja what do you look for in stocks? Like when you focus on FDX LLY HON STZ CI etc., what do you see?
3039 2018-09-16 00:26:37 No no this is infact the PROBLEM. 

Bitcoins are now trading at levels that are typically reserved for commodities or top tier stocks. The average person doesn't even THINK about owning a bitcoin they cant afford it.

What they're looking for is what they CAN own.

3050 2018-09-16 00:14:57 Of course everyone is buying expending a get rich scheme.  Do you understand or have you ever traded a security and see what people do with cheap stocks?  The volume and what all occurs?  Once the fad fades the volume will die and people will sell.  Doesn’t matter anything
3051 2018-09-16 00:14:12 Yea, the Rooney’s don’t need no damn advice on stocks.
3052 2018-09-16 00:14:02 This too is short lived !! Buying stocks is the only thing creating higher values !! Sales are and will go down in America !! Nike has verified they are anti-American !!  America has no need for imports who are only interested in advertising and America’s money !!

3058 2018-09-16 00:07:07 Without a name, that is a wide blanket statement.  For some stable stocks that rise slowly, it is added income without sale.  For high volatility names, wide OTM strikes that never strike yet offer good income as well.

They’re on the wrong side of history. 

Keep it classy Texas. Nike’s stocks are soaring.

3113 2018-09-14 23:40:05 It is far more complicated than a lack of food. Agricultural and environmental pollution, ship traffic & noise, sewage contaminating the food chain, pinniped predation on juvenile chinook stocks, loss of fish habitat just to start. Oddly, the Northern residents are thriving.

3122 2018-09-14 23:33:00 The idea that spouses or family members couldn't trade stocks probly isn't even constitutional. I'm actually not sure if the tax returns idea is either. Dunno.
3123 2018-09-14 23:29:31 Haha. I took a break from obsessing about cannabis stocks and saw that guy outside. Was like whoah. Sign of the Wolf.

3143 2018-09-14 23:17:24 Trading stocks, setting wages, directing internet traffic to the most addictive things. A lot of the evil in the world is now done by mindless electrons.
3144 2018-09-14 23:13:25 @johnandkenshow Do people know their mutual funds in their 401K is a basket of stocks?  Dumbasses.  Most up minimum 15%
3145 2018-09-14 23:12:04 The economy was trending after the downturn of 2008 & started a 7 year bull mkt run under Obama. The trend has continued under Trump. I know this as I swooped up a property in Colorado for 1/2 of the value. I did lose money on my stocks just prior 2 this but not as bad as others

3159 2018-09-14 23:02:58 Happening in a lot of states in rural areas; yet the Republicans keep repeating the lie that our economy is great and point to the stock market. Most working people don’t have stocks what they do have is no jobs or low stagnant wages that can’t keep up with the cost of living!
3160 2018-09-14 23:02:43 really @cubeunited  yall really gonna expel HyunA and E'Dawn for dating? like fr yall gonna be this petty like  okay watch your stocks drop without them you are nothing  smh
3161 2018-09-14 23:01:50 @ThomasWictor it isn’t just Politics and NYT not alone. WSJ publishes biz articles that affect stocks with no real fact check. They ran with a “rumor as fact” recently about VF Corp selling their denim brands late on a Friday. Had to write a new article on Monday to correct.

3163 2018-09-14 23:00:46 20-20 Vision?
Strategists at JPM Chase built a model to predict the next financial crisis.
Saying US stocks will fall 20% & emerging market stocks will be cut in half, they've pegged 2020 for when the collapse will happen. 
If only the world were that predictable.

3167 2018-09-14 22:58:16 I don't think I can afford a bottle of champagne the way my stocks are performing right now! Look like I will celebrate my birthday with a glass of water. Bottle of water is too rich for me.
3168 2018-09-14 22:57:38 Would I have to sell my MJ   stocks, "if" I own some before travelling there? Lol
3169 2018-09-14 22:56:28 Hopefully @Nike sees that supporting what’s right makes their stocks rise and will set the trend for @adidasUS @PUMA @Reebok @UnderArmour to follow

3172 2018-09-14 22:53:54 @LoserCrew Oh my, yes. Our local Sprouts stocks freshly baked bread called "Seedsational" which makes wonderful, thick, crunchy toast. Mmm...
3173 2018-09-14 22:53:26 You are not supposed to save in fiat. It is only meant to maintain its value in the short term, by design. Gold is a shit asset. Bitcoin will one day be a shit asset. Stocks will always be a great asset.
3174 2018-09-14 22:52:45 make sure he stocks up on paper towels !!!
3175 2018-09-14 22:51:19 And I bet you remember when stocks traded in 1/8s
3176 2018-09-14 22:50:38 There comes a time in every mans life where he becomes a prepper and stocks up on something. My grandpa did it with toothpaste, I’ve done it with macaroni and cheese. It seems you are doing it with toilet paper!
3177 2018-09-14 22:49:27 Addidas stock was down that day too, most apparel stocks were down because of  the tariff situation, not because of this situation.
3178 2018-09-14 22:49:07 Thank you very much very exciting for sure... Thanks you also for typing this out...  Never thought I would say I cannot wait for Monday...
3179 2018-09-14 22:48:13 Pull out of American stocks because the rule of law is dead in the United States.
3180 2018-09-14 22:47:20 This proves your a fucking dumbass and all you watch is cnn. Seriously how could you be this uninformed. I mean it’s amazing. You’re the type that reads Hillarys book and actually believes it. Hell you have the poster too don’t you? Did I hit a soft spot with your lame stocks? 
3181 2018-09-14 22:47:05 Occult suppliers!  Do I know anyone, or do you know anyone, who stocks: loose/bulk resins of labdanum, benzoin, livani, and copal, or oils of cedar, rosemary, and amber (esp. in ~4oz bottles)? A friend needs help resupplying after a cross-country move without her spiritual goods.
3182 2018-09-14 22:45:17 EVERYONE OF THOSE TRUMP HATERS NEED TO GIVE UP ALL OF THE LARGE PROFITS FROM SAVINGS AND STOCKS THAT YES TRUMP GOT FOR THEM !!!!
3183 2018-09-14 22:44:20 ooooh yeah!!!

Lol

I rarely daytrade ASX stocks since trading cryptos  - the market closing just as we get warmed up & the threat of Trading Halt fuck with my mojo - no problems with short term trades tho

But loving trading crypto - easy enough to make a wage & some weeks rock!
3184 2018-09-14 22:44:06 I need unlimited stocks of black lemonade in my life.
3185 2018-09-14 22:41:18 You were saying how their stocks were down the other day...
3186 2018-09-14 22:40:30 Have a look these #stocks that set all-time highs: $MGY
3187 2018-09-14 22:39:54 Benzino and the source had its reputation destroyed. Mariah and Nick cannon were humiliated (yes Mariah has had an overall successful career but still embarrassing). Ja rule and everlast became laughing stocks are well known for getting killed by eminem. Canines got embarrassed
3188 2018-09-14 22:39:26 yes this was cool BUT the stocks of the weatherchan brand...  the one with your faking reporter is gooing viral...i guess you must have a boardmeeting tomorrow
3189 2018-09-14 22:39:08 Will look more closely, but my understanding is that low volatility stocks do not produce higher mean returns; rather, they produce higher risk-adjusted returns. How is that factored into your analysis?
3190 2018-09-14 22:37:10 @instagram Can you build the function where I can search by geo AND hashtags in discover? I'll take FB stocks as payment.
3191 2018-09-14 22:36:59 Even if the Russian govt did not sanction the attempted murder of the Skripals or the use of Novichok, then they have a lot of explaining to do as to how stocks of a nerve agent they created (and were meant to have destroyed) got into the wrong hands.
3192 2018-09-14 22:35:44 Need me some weed stocks.
3193 2018-09-14 22:35:35 @VFSGlobal : never felt this frustrated in my life. I planned for my trip 3 months in advance . Applied visa 3 weeks in advance and thanks to your team that EVERYTHING screwed up. I cancelled my non refundable tickets and hotel stay and bearing expenses. My family is SAD. #WTF
3194 2018-09-14 22:35:31 19 #stocks made record highs in "technology" yesterday.
3195 2018-09-14 22:34:38 Maybe in some areas. But all I do is look at home prices. I'm seeing a lot of price reductions lately and the home building stocks have been slowly moving down since January. Just like in 2007. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon there will be more movement downward.
3196 2018-09-14 22:32:46 Won't be even close to 40 a month from now. No way. Go back to cannibis stocks cause you're obviously high.
3197 2018-09-14 22:32:37 We went to the park this Friday there is not much choice left. I asked if other products will be offered, the CM told me that the products presented are the latest references available. There are no stocks other than references in shelves mostly products for women

3201 2018-09-14 22:27:19 don't watch news networks really but I'm in this space where they play CNBC 24/7 & I have to hear this dude encouraging people to invest in Wingstop.

$AON, $TSCAP, $AFL, $AJG, $ERIE, $ORI
3204 2018-09-14 22:24:20 So you conveniently ignored the other stocks going down?
3205 2018-09-14 22:21:48 On another note. Started shorting home builder stocks. The housing market is slowing down. Debt, anxiety. Next stop recession.
3206 2018-09-14 22:21:44 @realDonaldTrump how’s those @Nike stocks doing, ya stupid orange bitch. #resign #JustDolt #Impeach45

3211 2018-09-14 22:19:05 nike stocks at a all time high rn lol
3212 2018-09-14 22:18:55 Bet they didn't plan for their stocks to drop like they did either. I'm sorry but supporting the artists in Cube is like supporting them to continue their slave contracts. I'd rather assist in Cube's crash & burn so the artists that I like can get out and find better companies.

3216 2018-09-14 22:16:27 @nmologne1 Yes... I've been trading for awhile... lol kidding.. I've been looking at stocks for awhile

3220 2018-09-14 22:12:37 @Fidelity you should have a dividend paying only stocks fund utilities some railroads etc railroads survived crash in 1929 I heard
3221 2018-09-14 22:11:31 On 1Broker there isn't Crypto to trade, that's on 1Fox. So I usually trade Forex and Commodities. Will be doing more stocks as well.
3222 2018-09-14 22:10:57 No I understand that. I trade stocks myself lol i just thought he was facing 30 to 37 months in prison

3224 2018-09-14 22:09:14 It’s like some of them are still bitching about the last dump they were in and yet they can’t see the new stocks they’re pumping are the same shit.
3225 2018-09-14 22:08:35 Great week and wish I could be in all the shiny stocks out there. What a difference from this summer! People are going to make some serious $. $Cybx, $Fat, $East, $Fdm, $Pkg, $Mah, $Grat. Of all of them I’d bet that $Cybx will do the best in the short term. Have a great weekend!
3226 2018-09-14 22:08:34 Countries are printing money and turning it into US currency and buying American Stocks and collecting the dividends.
3227 2018-09-14 22:07:04 Yeah, that en masse really worked blockading Nike didn't it?  Sales are up, their stocks have gone up.  You all are doing a fantastic job!  Keep it up!
3228 2018-09-14 22:06:43 Congrats to all the Altai holders $ati.v $ati.ca !!

3230 2018-09-14 22:06:42 @LimitedRunGames why would you not lock your stocks once an item is placed in the cart? @skastudios why are you in business with these guys? Every release is a disaster...
3231 2018-09-14 22:05:48 I understand that. But YOU choose size. Maybe it’s not right to have it 10x the US limit. But that’s your choice to use it. It’s meant for you to be able to trade large stocks like $WMT and shit. But WE trade penny stocks and blame them for us losing on high volatility

3236 2018-09-14 22:02:16 Cube realized that 1. It was a stupid thing to do and 2. Their stocks are tanking quickly
3237 2018-09-14 22:02:14 what if you live in the US and invest in Canada’s cannabis stocks? lol

3240 2018-09-14 22:00:59 Boom I love the Nike Flash ..... I don't buy stocks anymore, burnt my fingers once, BUT when I saw the Nike stocks on a slight decline, clear message Buy Now... and look what happened .... the rest is history.   @nike the Flash Rules 
3241 2018-09-14 22:00:08 no risk no reward..if you want 8% gains stick with buying blue chips stocks, gotta have the stomach for crypto
3242 2018-09-14 21:59:35 @RobinhoodApp Heyyyyyooooooo! 

Feature request: the ability to easily share Robinhood stocks to friends. The links should open directly in app. 

Thanks so much!!!! 


3243 2018-09-14 21:59:16 Lol love those people who watch 1 YouTube video on trading penny stocks and now believe they are god.
3244 2018-09-14 21:59:03 Clearly, the two series on the lower chart should have been in dollars, not multiples... If they had very limited ESOP before, then any increase will look insanely high in multiples. These stocks didn’t get diluted or lose value, obviously ESOP grants are still not that much...
3245 2018-09-14 21:58:48 Problem is the rich aren’t paying taxes anyway as they don’t have W2. I bet Warren Buffet doesn’t pay much in tax as he sells off losing stocks to offset his gains. Brings home a ton of cash and pays no taxes. 

If you have W2, you’ll always pay more taxes than one who doesn’t
3246 2018-09-14 21:57:26 Wishing I had more money to BUY, BUY, BUY....

Some clients I work for are billionaires and DGAF about Crypto and keep telling me to buy stocks, bonds, and real estate.

Makes me angry...Some peeps can't see the future and some can...

Lets's rock this bull market now. GO!

3250 2018-09-14 21:53:04 Looking back, you can always see exactly when you should have bought and sold your stocks.....In the financial markets, hindsight is forever 20/20, but foresight is legally blind.  And thus, for most investors, market timing is practical and emotional impossibility. - Ben. Graham

3258 2018-09-14 21:44:35 $spy $spx @cnbc we're at all time high valuations in the history of our markets and these fast money clowns are casually offering long calls on any number of stocks. NOT that we're in the biggest bubble ever, it's a time to preserve gains/raise cash.  They're all complicit..
3259 2018-09-14 21:44:04 #LITHIUM #cobalt stocks are setting up really well for early 2019.  May have to get some tax loss selling out of the way before the reset.  This sector is going to be YUGE going forward.
3260 2018-09-14 21:43:41 @OptionsAction How do I structure an option trade to benefit from the volatility in Cannabis stocks, like TLRY and CBG? #CNBCIndicator
3261 2018-09-14 21:42:32 Nope, I'm down again today. That makes it about -0.8% so far in September. Mainly large holdings in micro caps doing the damage - trading at lower end of the spread or a bit less. Number of profitable stocks higher than last week but quantum of profits down and losses up 
3262 2018-09-14 21:41:33 This week extremely profitable due to the advice and guidance from these outstanding, very down to earth, pro traders. Just follow the money! #FF #TradingStrategy #market #stocks

3263 2018-09-14 21:40:59 You’re not listening. I’m blaming greed, not stocks. It’s irrefutable that wages have stagnated as the rich have gotten richer. Blaming Mexicans is retarded. The greedy are bleeding America.
3264 2018-09-14 21:39:30 Too bad his 3 simple steps has him shorting the market and getting crushed as he loses all the money from ripping off his subscribers.  Also if it wasn’t for his awful low float stocks he pumps to his victims he’d be broke already

3269 2018-09-14 21:33:55 No there wasnt. The reason unions were around was because decent wages werent being paid. And yeah they worked for companies longer. But companies realized its cheaper to screw over employees  now what? Dont blame stocks.

3281 2018-09-14 21:30:08 Once again, the rush to legalize marijuana continues to produce unanticipated side effects. 

If you “have ever used marijuana or invested in marijuana stocks” (and admit it to border patrol), you’re banned from the USA for life. 

That’s about 70% of Canadians. More poor policy.

3288 2018-09-14 21:23:29 Nice to see I’m not the only one who regularly stocks up on Razzleberry Peace.
3289 2018-09-14 21:23:16 Update: Reduced $GLD exposure (sold options at small gain, now long stock at reduced size). We are experiencing a random walk, w/ possibility of another leg down (W). Added to my weed stocks short. As the newsflow normalizes, it will drop like a rock. Got the taste of it at t-1

3298 2018-09-14 21:17:21 I totally agree with you. One thing to give any mp an ear bashing when he’s at work. But to give same abuse to his wife and children to disgusting.
An mp shouldnt have to put up with crap from work when he/she is at home. Scum who think it’s acceptable should be put in stocks
3299 2018-09-14 21:16:45 Yasss for my Nike stocks making money!!

3305 2018-09-14 21:13:22 @CNBCFastMoney Can you get Dan to focus on stocks. He is not a political, analyst.  Anyone who took Dan's advice on politics or stocks is hurting right now. @jonnajarian @petenajarian
3306 2018-09-14 21:13:13 Weak US stock market could slow down the cycle of interest rate hikes, lower USD demand, lower EM debt cost, reduce EM's need to raise their own interest rates which would kill their struggling economies. As long as US is protectionist, falling US stocks are better for EM.  No?

3312 2018-09-14 21:11:29 I’m not sure if ppl still do not understand this but when u “preorder” smthg, u should expect 1-4 months delivery. U need to give them a prompt time for production & delivery. Unless they’re “ready” stocks which the goods already available, then you can received them immediately.

3314 2018-09-14 21:10:46 I see a future where investors have highly-diversified portfolios in stocks, bonds, and BTC...(because what is better than diversifying between two markets? Diversifying among three markets.). Just my thoughts.

3326 2018-09-14 21:04:14 stock down 15% and closed near lows?  Generally garbage stocks in long term down trends should be shorted into bounces.  Hope you took that bounce as a gift and ran for the hills.  Or keep adding to a loser...

3364 2018-09-14 20:44:45 You are just depressed because pot stocks are tanking and will continue to flush, flush, flush a lot of money down the toilet. Pot stocks are Ponzi schemes and that bubble is bursting as we speak.
3365 2018-09-14 20:44:23 Oh yes you are most worthy.  BTW Have you lost power today? Stay safe. I'm thinking stocks in lifejackets may be a good thing for the future.
3366 2018-09-14 20:44:13 I wanna say that i want cubes stocks to fall but i really dont thats the livelyhood of so many people going down the drain bcs some rich exec decided to fuck things up
3367 2018-09-14 20:43:52 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
3368 2018-09-14 20:43:15 America Ferrera the earth driller is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is RKOed through the wall of an orphanage by Valerie.

3371 2018-09-14 20:41:40 Just curious what was the news you read to take a position that big?
3372 2018-09-14 20:41:33 Had fun picking stocks today! Online ASSISTments due Monday! Vocabulary test on Tues.
3373 2018-09-14 20:40:55 If you’re not obsessed with your investments (people, ideas, stocks..), you’re just wasting your resources.
3374 2018-09-14 20:40:23 $6000 on $425,000?? 1.41% swing crazy money to risk
3375 2018-09-14 20:39:57 Nagpapanic na ako huhu kasi ang konti ng naiwan na stocks natin huhu asa tayo sa food delivery meron pa bang nagdedeliever ang lakas kasi talaga ng ulan 
3376 2018-09-14 20:39:53 Stocks Close Little Changed On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary ...
3377 2018-09-14 20:39:44 And HOW MANY stocks were BOUGHT BY NIKE & EMPLOYEES??!!
3378 2018-09-14 20:38:58 I decided to figure out my entire career and invest in stocks out of spite
3379 2018-09-14 20:38:45 Lol thank You Meir!!!  Im going to start calling you the master Of GIFS as well as the master of stocks haha.  Enjoy your weekend my fiend.
3380 2018-09-14 20:38:17 Client review today. “What’s up with Pot stocks ?” Me: “They will be fine, the weed story is great. “ client “we just grow our own weed.” Me. “Yeah me too, but the stocks are trading up right?” Client “Makes sense, I’m pretty high though”  
$TLRY, $CRON
3381 2018-09-14 20:37:12 Hmm i think @ZoomSound is trying to ruin my marriage. The F1 is a stonking piece of kit, and now this. Wonder where stocks them for a test drive?
3382 2018-09-14 20:36:51 Unacceptable! Trading stocks is a timing game, you cost a lot of people a lot of money by being down at such critical times during trading hours!
3383 2018-09-14 20:36:34 Los stocks eran separados  el error en activos fue no poner filtro
3384 2018-09-14 20:36:16 It's a scam because if you are middle-class you will have to pay it back! It froze average wages because companies bought back stocks instead of giving raises! Trickle down has never worked.  Look at Kansas!
3385 2018-09-14 20:35:01 I hear a lot of these people are into stocks
3386 2018-09-14 20:34:33 People say the best way to earn money is to invest in the stocks.
3387 2018-09-14 20:33:34 Yup, gonna put the stocks back on most likely.
3388 2018-09-14 20:32:41 McLeod, Kaveri, Metal stocks, Tata Power...

Still all the same names on my list.
3389 2018-09-14 20:32:24 A serious return on #Nike stocks today. Let all trump supporters burn as much as they want. All ready paid for. 
3390 2018-09-14 20:31:34 My knowledge of stocks and financial markets is basically at the white belt level. Any recommendations on getting familiar with stocks/financial markets?
3391 2018-09-14 20:31:11 Pop an IV in your vein Bruce. No wonder my stocks have been tanking. Get drunk bro!
3392 2018-09-14 20:30:38 I see a recession immediately if 2018 goes left. We wont make it until January. I will have all my stocks and bonds in cash by Dec 1rst .. and then transfer those to Chinese currency.. which will be a big "buy"  if the left wins - given the hit its taken from Trumps trade stuff
3393 2018-09-14 20:30:01 Actually, if you are watching when it happens, you'll catch it.  I am a day trader, so by nature I do not follow stocks that are a week or month out. This one appears to have some potential up growth.  Anytime you are in bed with a big player, it has to be positive future ???
3394 2018-09-14 20:29:13 I need a lesson on this. Any website/stocks recommendations?
3395 2018-09-14 20:28:57 Inexperienced "investors" should probably only stick to URA, U and then the producers CCJ, UUUU, URE everything else is pure speculation... Sure buy it but don't put your whole portfolio in penny stocks/explorers that's the dumbest advice ever come on man
3396 2018-09-14 20:28:05 1. Pay off all debt, 2. Buy a new house and rent currently paid off house out, 3. Keep 33% in crypto, 4. Trade options on some stocks, 5. Buy up some passive dividend income funds, 6. Pay for my education for next 2 years, 7. Quit job
3397 2018-09-14 20:28:04 investing in stocks is top 3 most valuable things i’ve done
3398 2018-09-14 20:27:37 Money is not technology and it’s not stocks....there will very soon be something much, much better than EOS...just dumb grasping at one alt to the next. Go buy xrp.
3399 2018-09-14 20:27:17 The haters don’t even understand how stocks work
3400 2018-09-14 20:27:03 Another solid week .  Looking towards a select few stocks to break out next week . Enjoy your weekend 
3401 2018-09-14 20:27:03 Stocks close flat as another trading week comes to an end. Join Coach Frank for the Market Recap over on YouTube at 4:30 Eastern to discuss the day's price action and look ahead to next week. #trading #investing
3402 2018-09-14 20:26:59 Yeah that's totally what I meant... lol that's awesome though! I know nothing about stocks
3403 2018-09-14 20:26:20 Pretty much encompasses the bullshit of DC
3404 2018-09-14 20:26:04 Some positive chatter on Casino stocks today .  $WYNN and $LVS look the better ones ?
3405 2018-09-14 20:24:50 Up $40k on pot stocks but big picture idea and ended up minimal...seriously starting today when up >$20k on the day. Take the damned rest of day OFF!! No more excuse!! Gotta settle with myself missing opportunity. It's okay. It's okay.
3406 2018-09-14 20:24:29 No as a shareholder, if uranium stays this low for next 10 years 49 of the 50 will be out of business... Cameco will maybe still be around. Telling inexperienced people to buy indivdual names especially if they are basically all penny stocks is very irresponsible of you
3407 2018-09-14 20:23:45 No... I only had this one. I was watching the $SPY but it ended up not acting how I wanted to so I looked over at $BABA and happened to look when an opportunity was forming. I recognized it and scaled in.  SPY and BABA are the easiest option stocks to play in my opinion.
3408 2018-09-14 20:23:29 Gusto ko ng mainit na sabaw naghahanap ako ng stocks ng cup noodles namin naubos na pala. :( 

May nagpost ng emergency hotlines na delivery nunbers ng fastfood d ba pwedeng pati safety ng riders delivery men isipin nyo.
3409 2018-09-14 20:22:23 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
3410 2018-09-14 20:21:21 Time to invest in some stocks now
3411 2018-09-14 20:20:25 In your 50's: Stocks stocks stocks stocks stocks
3412 2018-09-14 20:20:16 Stocks teach us to look for good news to invest money. Crypto teach us to look for bad news to invest money. I hope people understand what crypto is doing and why great traders/investors don't do and believe much crypto.
3413 2018-09-14 20:20:11 I have no idea how to trade those stocks. All over the place.

3416 2018-09-14 20:19:16 I have three strategies for trading Canadian oil and gas stocks with assets in Canada:  1. 2019 Canadians vote Justin Trudeau and his band of dog shit out or if not 2. 2023 Another chance to vote them out or if not.  3.  Never again as EV growth starts to reduce oil demand.

3419 2018-09-14 20:16:13 Just after he gets off the golf course. N stocks up on some paper towels!
3420 2018-09-14 20:16:08 Next week should be good if Canada agrees to a new Nafta deal... Check out $LGORF

If some of my other stocks don't work out, I'm selling, and going all in on $LGORF
3421 2018-09-14 20:15:57 so in 1932, (oh god I cant believe I just had to say that) the stocks had a crash and they have came way up from there every 10 years is a cycle approx. it will all be ok. dont sell dude!  and stop thinking about 1932 for petes sake
3422 2018-09-14 20:15:56 Get an education. Nobody mentioned who buys stocks. Stock PRICES are driven by turnover. And mobs kitting up in the latest "resist" fashion drives that. Time will tell. Investigations prove Nike uses child labor - China among others. Will pay the price. Tic...toc...
3423 2018-09-14 20:15:38 Jackie is a clever chook who certainly knows her stuff! She only stocks quality products (I have the laptop table) and her customer service is unparalleled. 

Thank you Jackie! You definitely have a repeat customer here! 
3424 2018-09-14 20:15:08 Closing "green" stocks:  AMFE .133 +20.9%....ANDI .002 +11%....PAOG .004 +5.7%....LWLG $1.07 +5%....DIRV .006 +3.5%....NBEV $1.59 +1.6%....SWRM .017 +.8%....EHVVF .03 +.3%...got more SODE .042 closed .065 unch.

3425 2018-09-14 20:14:51 Wall Street Instant Update: At the close #Stocks little changed in a back and forth session with the small cap Russell posting the largest equity gain at 1722 up 8
#Oil WTI closes up .6% at $68.99/bbl
#Gold settled at $1203.40 -.4%
3426 2018-09-14 20:14:29 Stocks end little changed after midday hit on more China trade-war fears. Dow +8, +0.03% to 26,154. S&P +0.03%, Nasdaq -0.05%. Smaller stocks revive: Russell 2000 +0.4%

But a decent week: Nasdaq +1.4%, S&P +1.2%, Dow +0.9%, Russell +0.5%

Better than Paul Manafort's week.
3427 2018-09-14 20:14:11 Nike stocks closed at an all time high yesterday. That's weird @realDonaldTrump
3428 2018-09-14 20:13:56 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +.4%; US flat. Trade tensions with China tool some steam out of a US market rally. Trump's tough talk may backfire & cause trade war. Market likely much higher without Trump's hardline positions. Between that & Mueller much short-term risk.
3429 2018-09-14 20:13:27 Noticing the markets getting more aggressively "yeah but what have you done for me lately".  Stocks are being taken out behind the woodshed and shot for the merest of 1 or 2 cent misses, or the slightest hint of tepidity.

#toughcrowd
3430 2018-09-14 20:12:55 You know how many stocks are at an all time high, a very over evaluated market, corruption at its finest, the federal reserve and keeping interest rates artificially low...read about Austrian economics (ABCT)...
3431 2018-09-14 20:12:01 Have a great weekend everyone 
3432 2018-09-14 20:11:37 What are the best bollard growth stocks?
3433 2018-09-14 20:11:02 I went heavy into Zinc until the Zaire collapse, but luckily I was able to change my portfolio into a heavy soy and Paraguay small cap fund, sprinkled with Chilean mining interests and mid cap tech, underpinned with renooberated bond inversions and leveraged transportation stocks
3434 2018-09-14 20:10:52 Even if two stocks have the same price it does not mean they share the same market cap.. you really shouldn’t be investing if you don’t understand that
3435 2018-09-14 20:10:24 @CNBCClosingBell I’m buying stocks now $MA & $HD
3436 2018-09-14 20:10:23 $TLRY wouldnt shock me to see this squeeze to new highs next week IF pot stocks remain as strong as they were today.  $TLRY held up really well.  Green start to Monday to force further buyins
3437 2018-09-14 20:09:53 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity   Thanks for the publicity. I wouldn’t doubt it if you two had stocks in Nike.
3438 2018-09-14 20:09:10 Stocks rose because of all the dumb shits that burned their shoes and needed to go out and buy another pair.
3439 2018-09-14 20:09:05 I think 127 out of the 3300 Nasdaq stocks are foreign
3440 2018-09-14 20:09:00 
amazon pays ABOVE minimum wage, full benefit package from Day1 which includes: Full Medical (health,vision,dental), Monthly Bonus(attendance & FC performance), matched 401k, stocks...etc...
3441 2018-09-14 20:08:53 BTW...HOWS THE NIKE BOYCOT GOING? Their stocks are at an all time high
3442 2018-09-14 20:07:12 Is there anyone that can teach me about stocks and funds? I’m tired of my money not making me more money
3443 2018-09-14 20:06:52 Thanks for nothing no cannabis stocks talk?? Was waiting
3444 2018-09-14 20:06:08 First Manafort pleads guilty, then MGK gets bodied by Eminem, now Nike stocks are at an all time high. Rough day huh Republicans?

3450 2018-09-14 20:04:57 Stocks go up, stocks go down. Crazy market today, nonetheless a monster of a week. Thanks @smartertrader
3451 2018-09-14 20:04:33 Bro if more companies started to fw black ppl and their stocks start to boost up too black ppl gone be on a super come up forever 
3452 2018-09-14 20:04:15 Simple 3-step process to making tons of dough trading stocks and calling it a day at 11am everyday? Where do I sign up? <~~~ Seeing these sort of ridiculous ads on YouTube now, reminiscent of Bitconnect ads in December 2017...
3453 2018-09-14 20:04:04 Is there anywhere in the UK that stocks your products?
3454 2018-09-14 20:03:53 Buying their own stocks?
3455 2018-09-14 20:03:42 There are lots of stocks to play.  In fact, of the 40-50 or so left all will do fine.  On a percentage gain basis many will do better than CCJ.  Who cares if they are fully integrated?  That does not mean they will do best.  If left out of the s232 forget it.

3457 2018-09-14 20:02:36 Pure compliment! Hard to milk the cow for those profits if you can only do one thing at a time. Only guessing here, but I would guess that you had more than the above stocks on your screen/s.
3458 2018-09-14 20:01:29 It’s  a lie about stocks investors buying stock to promote him in ad
3459 2018-09-14 20:01:20 The year is 2020. You can trade stocks and commodities against BTC. Boooom
3460 2018-09-14 20:01:03 Really wanna buy some stocks
3461 2018-09-14 20:00:25 The case study in the book outlines how one retailer digitally connected their supply chain, in the process decimating out-of-stocks!  Implementation led by yours truly, utilizing the leading-edge slow sellers planning capabilities from @JDASoftware
3462 2018-09-14 20:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
3463 2018-09-14 20:00:00 Not to mention very illiquid!
3464 2018-09-14 19:59:38 love to slap someone and then give them a dollar
3465 2018-09-14 19:59:15 Anyone want to hold stocks over the weekend to see what China does? Apparently that's the best risk/reward of the era
3466 2018-09-14 19:58:18 Many have said on here but if your sure of your research and invest on conviction and not what others do then you should follow your head not your heart. Works for me. Always a pull back in all stocks at times  , some more than others , Market makers on AIM use Fear as a tool
3467 2018-09-14 19:58:01 stocks. savings.
3468 2018-09-14 19:57:55 US border agents will ask for breakdown of my mutual funds to see if any weeds stocks are held....LoL...bullshit article.
3469 2018-09-14 19:57:47 The ice looks safe and calm over the raging stream . I hope you all bought stocks to go along with those new Nikes.
3470 2018-09-14 19:55:43 You Dems must not understand stocks. Give it 6 months for the stock to realize its profit impact. Clueless!

3474 2018-09-14 19:54:05 Not worried about the loss. Just upset it was on a non niche setup.

I should not have been messing, but the opportunity was too great in my eyes.

Lesson learned. Stick to my bread and butter POS stocks that I can nail with my eyes closed.

Let the experts deal w/ the rest <3
3475 2018-09-14 19:53:45 Impressive come back Pot stocks. No positions.
3476 2018-09-14 19:52:29 All my stocks are up!  And that has to do with me picking good ones, not the "president".
3477 2018-09-14 19:52:07 Too true about knowing how stocks move. Glad you pushed me to expand my playbook outside of Turd Trading. Rock on :)

3480 2018-09-14 19:51:25 When trading stocks... You have to let go in caring about money

I've hurt myself many times reacting to losing money

Best to just hold for as long as it takes if you believe in the stock
3481 2018-09-14 19:51:23 Better than the 6 pro stocks they'll get for sure.
3482 2018-09-14 19:50:50 If she revealed it before cube denied it then it would have been a whole other story. She would still get hate because as u said above. But the whole thing was cube blaming the whole trust thing for its stocks which might or might not be true
3483 2018-09-14 19:50:19 Well then I guess there wasn't backlash at least none that was felt, if stocks hit an all time high.
3484 2018-09-14 19:50:07 He & his gangsters in cabinet probably will come away a millionaire/billionaire everyone, when they’re done, because they have a buy/sell info the back room. So, everybody should watch when to buy or sell their stocks or funds carefully. Else, they may be left “holding the bag.”

3487 2018-09-14 19:47:28 These peices of shits are just trying to drop stocks because they missed out on them having their money tied somewhere else

3489 2018-09-14 19:46:41 And to suggest that @Nike stock prices are driven by "mob rule" ignores the reality of who buys stocks. It ain't the mob.
3490 2018-09-14 19:46:26 Musk antics attracting more Tesla bears? @S3Partners reports that $TSLA now the 2nd most shorted stock on the market by level of short interest. Trailing only $AAPL. Other top stocks on the list? $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL $MSFT $AMD $CVS $NVDA $FB
3491 2018-09-14 19:46:25 Is it a backlash if the stocks are at all time high. You could say it’s more of a backlash against those against the add. It’s almost like more people don’t care about the add then do.

3494 2018-09-14 19:43:35 Dude I also read that if you have stocks in weed and you tell them you are banned as well like if you invest in weed you can't go to the states lmfao
3495 2018-09-14 19:43:16 Relative to the bourgeoisie that makes the majority of their income from rents as capitalism evolves. At least that is the theory in Marx. So the proletariate has skills but no access to the means of production which are stocks of wealth.

3503 2018-09-14 19:38:41 You haven't run out of cylinders again have you??????   You need to get as many as you can whilst the opposition are in disarray with their so called "lite" stocks.
3504 2018-09-14 19:38:03 I agree, passive investment reduces volatility and trading as most stocks move inline with qqq/spy efts, but that has been going on for a few years at least not just today. Why the volume is so low today and the action is so weird? Idk, may be the hurricane.

3510 2018-09-14 19:35:26 You might like my "Painless Tax".  Tax rate on investments goes to zero.  Stock prices, based on after tax return, go up ~25%.  Before 0% tax goes into effect, tax all appreciation by 20%, or about $1T in taxes.  Stocks up $6T.  Painless.  That's 5 years worth of tax revenue.

3518 2018-09-14 19:32:28 The US has made it clear that any Canadian who smokes weed legally, works in the legal marijuana field or invests in legal marijuana stocks will receive a lifetime ban from entry into the country.
3519 2018-09-14 19:32:22 You invested in a pump n dump stock at what sounds like a somewhat high price..can’t let yourself get played but companies like that turn to Canada pot stocks few out there to get into, Acbff.
3520 2018-09-14 19:32:00 I been motivated to buy stock. Put 100 dollars into a bunch of random stocks. Lost like 8 dollars and now Im starting to regret this shit lol
3521 2018-09-14 19:31:45 If i didn’t have my other money in other stocks i would’ve put $500 in and made like $600
3522 2018-09-14 19:31:30 If it was really a poor choice, those companies would be out of business. But they're not. Their profits are going up, their stocks are going up, their CEOs' salaries are going up. Under capitalism, it wasn't a poor choice at all. The goal is to maximize profits, isn't it?

3532 2018-09-14 19:27:35 If you can make it work, then by all means. 

I just happened to notice from GaryV's feed and wanted to extend some thoughts of someone that has been there and done that. 

Now I trade real stocks w/ real catalysts. Completely different game.
3533 2018-09-14 19:27:08 I'm just saying, if you can, now is a really good time to buy up some of that Cube Ent stocks
3534 2018-09-14 19:26:54 So it’s been a great end of the week! Nike stocks are up, despite Trump’s asinine rhetoric & Mueller has snagged himself another cooperating witch!
3535 2018-09-14 19:26:28 It's been some time since @realDonaldTrump has been askedwhen he's going to enact legislation to: raise the age limit of gun purchasers, ensure comprehensive background checks are done before purchase, and ensure assault rifles and bump stocks are not made available to anyone
3536 2018-09-14 19:26:26 Both stocks are at/near 52 week lows. I am sure both companies management teams have a plan to move the stock price up (assuming they care about the stock price), but until they get rid of the short interest that is not going to happen anytime soon.
3537 2018-09-14 19:26:05 Question: Blue Wave means what for stocks

3540 2018-09-14 19:24:01 Just add things like bump stocks to the list of things people may not own.
3541 2018-09-14 19:23:47 Why do I sell stocks right before they jump in value, I could have made a fat buck 
3542 2018-09-14 19:22:56 The GDX/GLD ratio just recently turned higher. So, yes, I suspect the gold stocks will lead the metal higher. Either way, if you buy GDX or GLD and can close your eyes for a few weeks it should work out well.
3543 2018-09-14 19:22:36 Intersting. Did you check other stocks, too?
3544 2018-09-14 19:22:02 Imagine what this kemi rumours might have done to stocks. Yet the leadership of this nation is reckless enough not to address it. Smh.
3545 2018-09-14 19:21:01 In 2013, LegiStorm reported that O'Rourke may have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of Congress from participating in the initial public offering (IPO) of company stocks. O'Rourke had purchased seven stocks, including stock
3546 2018-09-14 19:20:08 His stocks went down! Like are people real

3561 2018-09-14 19:12:02 @Bradley1972 @Lexcorp331 the stocks listed above ARE NOT at all time highs. And overall market will go a lot higher.
3562 2018-09-14 19:12:00 Lots of miners got letters when URA finished.  If you look at Lamaride, URG, and UUUU all 3 did.  UEC never posted one and I saw some sales a week ago yet very small.  We think they are about done for most stocks if not all.

3572 2018-09-14 19:10:15 I agree that’s why I hold up on WMT or even TGT for that matter. Plus I wonder with all the growth that Walmart is trying to achieve if that will hurt there profits there for their stocks. I would like to get in on one of them before the holidays though

3577 2018-09-14 19:09:02 Why do people always infer reasons to stocks rising and falling? The indexes are at new highs, sovereign funds are buying stock & companies are buying back their stock.

3581 2018-09-14 19:03:25 There are too many factors to really say this is a valid study. You wouldn’t compare to Nasdaq but with similar stocks that weren’t breached. Then you have to take out other issues. It’s an attempt but generally breaches seem to not have an impact over.
3582 2018-09-14 19:03:24 Like many before said , Screw Nike ! The only way Nike made it big in US was because They did & do hire illegals ! Sweat shops for kid and adults alike..
Okay , well , just as phallus as Nike is so is Kaepernick doing the same deplorable unspeakable things. stocks with Nike ?

3590 2018-09-14 19:00:09 Stocks have gone up since the inception of the stock market. Has nothing to do with them stealing wealth, it has to do with inflation and the fact that companies make profits
3591 2018-09-14 18:59:27 Beleive is something even if it means losing everything. Nike beleives this and are living it right now. Just look at the stocks and co. Value In the toilet. LOL
3592 2018-09-14 18:59:05 well, I was talking with my friend about trading these stocks.. and I told him I wasnt going to trade it because it is not my setup and it is more like an "opportunity".
I was able to keep my discipline in check after I asked myself "Is this a loss that makes sense to me?"
3593 2018-09-14 18:58:38 Hi admin coinlibio, i want to ask you why lgc (litegoldcoin) the same on stocks exchange and idax? I think they ate diffrent coin?
3594 2018-09-14 18:57:06 Oh wow, you’re right! TIL. Sadly, from my app’s perspective all I’m seeing in that cashtag stream on books was trending news about Jian Ghomeshi. I’ll take the stocks, please!
3595 2018-09-14 18:57:04 Don’t like record stocks?
3596 2018-09-14 18:57:01 Honestly? Stay the fuck away from leverage. Especially with volatile stocks like this one.
3597 2018-09-14 18:55:40 it’s stocks with socks szn
3598 2018-09-14 18:55:30 It’s genuinely disgusting even after you know that it was meant as a campaign against online trolls.... because the brand still only stocks tiny sizes! A fuckin laugh they’re having
3599 2018-09-14 18:55:23 They must really want their stocks to drop.
3600 2018-09-14 18:55:17 As I pointed out to my younger brother who is an airline executive, before biofuels as a substitute/supplement for Jet8, we need to make sure it isn't pressed from food stocks like soybeans. Preferably it should come from algae or similar non-food stock.
3601 2018-09-14 18:54:58 What happened to all the #Roboadvisor advertisements? Guess that "passive management" into too much international hasn't done so well.

3603 2018-09-14 18:54:23 The vote took place on the last day of the commission’s biannual meeting in the southern Brazilian city of Florianopolis. The 89-member commission was created in 1946 to conserve whale stocks and promote the orderly development of the whaling industry.
3604 2018-09-14 18:54:03 I'm really pleased with him so far, I pay $4k less in taxes now in my small business, and I also can retire 2 years earlier due to my IRA, and Stocks that have gone up.  I was completely stagnant under Obama.  Thank the Lord people started voting Democrats out in 2010!
3605 2018-09-14 18:52:43 #stocks has been my new hobby. Making my money work for me was a great decision!
3606 2018-09-14 18:52:19 You probably aren't worried about your stocks - because you look like a liberal leach that enjoys the benefits of the rich .. either through gold diggin or welfare. But willing to bet your parents/grandparents do care and are part of thre stock market for retirement - Hurt them!
3607 2018-09-14 18:51:35 Another great call!
3608 2018-09-14 18:51:24 At America's #1 Anti-Union company Amazon, a LOT of employees do NOT benefit from stock options because a LOT  of them either QUIT or are FIRED before One year. You see, it takes TIME  for Stocks to vest.
3609 2018-09-14 18:50:35 Sure, but real estate wealth is a lot less volatile. Your home isn't likely to drop 30% in a month as stocks sometimes do.
3610 2018-09-14 18:50:31 ...because they can be replaced. The Tories hate anything that's owned by the public, they asset strip, they did exactly the same in with British Rail, Royal Mail, British Gas, the council housing stocks etc. They can't be trusted.
3611 2018-09-14 18:49:33 See what happens to it after the next quarterly report. Stocks now when they are in headlines means nothing. Look at sales! #lookatdicks

Which is fine but then you bawl when the company doesn't go down. Their stocks go up. . Trump has a 36% approval rating. Done by 2020.
3618 2018-09-14 18:47:27 Not much of a backlash if their stocks are at an all-time high.
3619 2018-09-14 18:47:23 @CitronResearch are a bunch of scamming @ss holes, they short all the stocks and this is what they are doing. So they can buy in for cheap. They should be investigated
3620 2018-09-14 18:47:00 2/2

Why the Hindenburg Omen might not be useful now:

The Omen measures breadth divergence in the NYSE. 55/100 largest stocks on the NYSE are non-U.S. stocks

U.S. stocks rallied this year while ex-U.S. tanked. Not so much breadth divergence as it is foreign weakness
3621 2018-09-14 18:45:12 Because the only reason why businesses sold their stocks to begin with. Was to pay those high taxes. Now that they don't have to pay those high taxes. They can buy their stocks back. Two years from now we are going to have $20 an hour jobs because of it.
3622 2018-09-14 18:44:38 Andrew Left and his cohorts at Citron are criminals. They make money by releasing bogus research then shorting, enticing investors to sell, then buying at lower price because they know they are hitting good stocks.

In India, it's not like the fundamentals are great but the stocks are zooming up. In US, tariff wars r looming and yet stocks are zooming up too. Rite? How?
3637 2018-09-14 18:39:42 No breadth? Sign of a weak market if only a few mega cap stocks are pulling index along because as each loses momentum you end up with

3642 2018-09-14 18:37:44 Those businesses make money by owning their own stocks. And a lot of it over time. That's why they are buying stocks back. So they'll have the money to give their employees the raises and the benefits they deserve. But it takes time.

Keep in mind that most of the stocks over-owned by index funds are REITs,  so it is not an apple-for-apple comparison 

Speaking of REITs, another fun index fact:

Number of US-listed REITs: 183
Number of US-listed real estate funds: 155

3663 2018-09-14 18:28:33 excellent point - that cash becomes debt to be repaid at a higher cost than the mortgage was. This is also likely considered the cash sitting on the sidelines that can go into stocks they use to say we're not a peak enthusiasm.

3675 2018-09-14 18:23:23 It’s not long term. Those who know how to manipulate stocks is doing so. Also the same applies to the super rich and those who operate certain funds which have many investors. They are only doing this to try and make up for the almost 4 billion lost of devaluation in stock.

3678 2018-09-14 18:21:59 The stock market's best buy signals often present themselves at times when you feel emotionally beat down and simply believe your stocks are performing horribly. Learning to pull the "buy" trigger at these points could lead to rewards down the road.

3742 2018-09-14 17:47:35 Anything you guys want me to chart right now? Have some free time and taking requests:
Altcoins, $BTC, Forex, stocks, commodities, you name it
3743 2018-09-14 17:46:59 Took me 2 & a half months to burn a $100 trading account after making & securing profits. All because of one thing: overconfidence.

Don’t try to outsmart the market. Fix up & follow the rules of profitable trading or get burned.

3744 2018-09-14 17:45:53 Canadian pot stocks are going to be worth a lot more in a few years. I’ve invested in two of them recently.
3745 2018-09-14 17:45:07 Adding a customizable news feed to get the latest info on stocks and companies plus adding an overall stocks ticker that targets all commodities and crypto can now be done with the improved SMX platform! #dope #cryptobillings #smokeexchange #dopecoin #btc #eth #litecoin #altcoins
3746 2018-09-14 17:44:21 U proved it again, nonsense
3747 2018-09-14 17:44:11 So what's the Agenda behind global warming?? Is it because you guys bought into it? Donated money, or invested in stocks that supports global warming. Scientists have proven the opposite about the Polar Ice Caps. #ResistTheResistance
3748 2018-09-14 17:43:39 Fellow Canadians! Be very careful! If you smoke weed legally, work in the pot industry or have invested in pot stocks, you will be denied entry into the USA.
3749 2018-09-14 17:43:21 Great piece of research!  Higher oil prices just in time to kick off crash in USD, stocks and bonds.  Wait til shale production rolls over.
3750 2018-09-14 17:42:42 Government claimed the level on the door handle was low because of the rain. How can they tell if there is no data? either more lies from The Government or there is more information available. Porton Down know an awful lot about Novichok - they had stocks.
3751 2018-09-14 17:42:33 My only reservation is if that value will be sustained I usually go long with stocks and activision hasn’t had the best rep.
3752 2018-09-14 17:42:16 i guess my e trade acc got auto closed bc i didnt use it and was trying to have it as a savings acc and once i had like 1.5k id use it in stocks. they mailed me a check w my ~500 in it. boys i can pay my car bills this month easy peasy!
3753 2018-09-14 17:40:40 Take Netflix out of the FANG stocks. The remainder is the safety council
3754 2018-09-14 17:39:27 Buying stocks for your kids could be one of the best investments you can make while their young
3755 2018-09-14 17:38:31 We did....
3756 2018-09-14 17:37:56 Clay's rhetoric towards Nike has remained consistent. He said to wait until the first quarter? Clearly you don't trade stocks then or you'd understand. Lies won't bury @ClayTravis
3757 2018-09-14 17:37:49 Still working on the format of a weekly report that I want to start producing. 

The report will include the options trade database, events calendar, upcoming earnings alerts with historical data on how stocks reacted previously, and trade ideas. Updates to come this weekend!
3758 2018-09-14 17:37:11 Bit harsh mate. They don't even pick stocks. Probably why we get on well 
3759 2018-09-14 17:36:46 @RVG_Dividend hey can’t beat that. Profit is profit and you can sleep at night with those value stocks
3760 2018-09-14 17:36:35 Listen stocks keep you on edge.....watching my money grow!!!!
3761 2018-09-14 17:35:48 #TradeIdea #stocks to SHORT if you think they will go lower next trading day $IRM $NI $O
3762 2018-09-14 17:35:27 Not that he cares, but would love moar of the mining-focused commentary.  Also, hoping he comments more on lithium stocks/deposits with seasonal strength approaching.  He was a prolific contributor on the topic in other forums.
3763 2018-09-14 17:35:09 worser the news comes out, the stocks start bouncing LOL .
3764 2018-09-14 17:34:43 Yes I too can take small snapshots of stocks to make a picture fit my narrative. All stocks go up and down multiple times in a day.
3765 2018-09-14 17:34:27 Hi, due to limited stocks, we'll only be accepting 40 orders for Wanna One's Summer Package. All of these are already secured to our supplier, and they are first press. Thanks! -
3766 2018-09-14 17:33:58 Someone should start a “Trump Fund” consisting of the stocks of all the companies Trump has attacked.
3767 2018-09-14 17:33:09 Hurricane Flo can you chill out now? My dog thinks you’re trying to break into our front door and she needs to potty but doesn’t wanna blow away with you
3768 2018-09-14 17:33:09 My favorite opinion from smashers was, how final smashes should be legal  or how 2 stocks should still be a thing.
3769 2018-09-14 17:32:21 I’m new to investing and buying stocks, so I’ve just been buying cheap stocks that seemed to be successful without really knowing what the company was.

I just realized, thanks to Google, that Cronos Group is a Canadian marijuana company.

Awesome 
3770 2018-09-14 17:31:53 As Q4 approaches, a seasonally strong period for #uranium and #lithium stocks, #FF with a focus on these commodities

@miningramblings - seen it all in uranium
@YellowCaker - no BS uranium macro
@backstroke_ - great source for lithium focused news
3771 2018-09-14 17:31:24 Flight to safety resumes ... Pot stocks and Chinese Cayman Island VIEs bounce!
3772 2018-09-14 17:30:40 $ADBE - One of the mega-cap super software #stocks. Now on a new all-time high after earnings.
3773 2018-09-14 17:28:35 I wouldn't make people worry about the timing of the pay off. Just buy some and forget about it. Aren't people advised to do that with stocks? And the reasoning is purely academic, which is interesting but goal one should be helping people with the transition.
3774 2018-09-14 17:28:20 I usually don't prognosticate, but I would look for an uptick in popcorn stocks. #largebucketplease
3775 2018-09-14 17:28:08 Oh my goodness! I didn't expect a response. 
I normally shop: 
6520 N Nevada St, Spokane, WA 99208 . 
If you know another location that stocks it regularly...I'll drive to it! 
You have great employees there, just so you know. 
I'm happy to go where you have it. 
3776 2018-09-14 17:27:56 Not to mention that Nike, like most stocks, has been trending up. It was near all time highs like a month ago too

He could've tweeted then but narrative
3777 2018-09-14 17:27:45 Determining the effects of the add from stocks is extremely difficult in the short run. The over reaction to the drop in value is equivalent to the over reaction the rise in value.
3778 2018-09-14 17:26:57 Then he started shorting stocks and made a ton of money.
3779 2018-09-14 17:25:57 The first video talks about how to make list of ‘good’ stocks. Go through it the 4th time.
3780 2018-09-14 17:25:18 Will somebody please give me a heads up on what company trumpsters decide to boycott next so I can buy stocks ahead of time!
3781 2018-09-14 17:24:27 I didn’t thought I was going to be able to say this about my favorite kpop agency, but i’m happy that your stocks are going down Cube #justiceforhyuna #justiceforedawn
3782 2018-09-14 17:24:20 yeaa most of my friends have weed stocks so we were joking if we will be required to bring broker statements to cross boarders hahaha there's no way it can be verified
3783 2018-09-14 17:24:08 I do not short stocks. I have no money tied to Tesla. I think I need to put that in my bio because people seem to forget that I have said that 100 times.
3784 2018-09-14 17:23:52 Dear David Hogg,

Please go back to school and take classes in reading comprehension.

Ps. Looking to invest in some stocks. What corporation are you going to be calling a for a boycott this week? I wanna buy some shares and make out big!
3785 2018-09-14 17:22:41 Why did you pick sfix to short? Wouldn’t amazon at 3 billion income and 1 trillion market cap be way worse than sfix? I think weed stocks are another $weed has 30 million revenue not even income and at 8 billion market cap
3786 2018-09-14 17:22:35 I don't think its a matter of being afraid, its the volatility they are looking for, and most of the time it doesn't happen with expensive stocks. When someone is playing with less than $5k, they seek a double in a day or week, not a year. They can find that in penny stocks.
3787 2018-09-14 17:22:10 Stocks Rally On China Trade War Talks; Apple iPhones Unveiled; Tilray, Nio IPOs Soar: Weekly Review - Investor's Business Daily
3788 2018-09-14 17:21:58 That's a huge portion of the population. Its smoking at any time ever technically. Also anyone who invests in the stocks. Or works for one of the legal companies here. Exec's from Sherritt mining have been banned from the US for 20 years. They mine in Cuba
3789 2018-09-14 17:21:43 Hmm, so Americans don’t invest in marijuana company stocks? 
3790 2018-09-14 17:21:13 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX emerging signal aborted, no completion possible.  SPX uptrend remains intact albeit perturbed by tariffs.
3791 2018-09-14 17:21:11 SmartMoneyTrades was the name of the discord...can't believe it has been a few years almost since @SM_Stocks was around. Never forget where I got found. What a great journey it has been, excited to see what the future has in store #FridayFeeling #PositiveVibes
3792 2018-09-14 17:21:06 Of course not.
#Stocks can't sustainably keep rising while incomes are near-flat and many incomes of current working now nil.
Exact repeat of housing bubble.
3793 2018-09-14 17:20:58 Altai management is currently reviewing there maps to identify spots to drill for conventional gas and spots for underground gas storage! Call the company if you don't believe me! $ati.v $ati.ca

3794 2018-09-14 17:20:51 Sandy Hook had nothing to do with ""Bump Stocks." Newtown was warned he was a threat and did nothing. Again, why do you feel the need to flak for authorities failing to protect the public??

3796 2018-09-14 17:19:33 Who would have thought @Nike’s stocks would be at an all time high after their Collin Kaepernick campaign. #ToucheNike
3797 2018-09-14 17:19:20 Anyways montreal and ottawa are the laughing stocks of the league feels@good to be a b’s fan
3798 2018-09-14 17:19:04 For becoming Multibagger in 10yrs:
6x need 18% cagr
8x need 21% cagr
10x need 24% cagr
I guess better approach would be to invest in small/mid cap stocks or funds
@NileshShah68 @AnilSinghviZEE
3799 2018-09-14 17:18:57 Problem is stocks contract... He gets an extension for 6-6
3800 2018-09-14 17:18:42 It amazes me that people have no clue how stock prices work. Bad or good news doesn’t push or lower a stock. Selling shares or buying shares moves the stock. It takes months of sales one way or the other to change stock prices. Quarterly earnings reports. All stocks are high
3801 2018-09-14 17:17:56 True but its  just not enough people lined up against Kaepernick to make any effect on Nike stocks its just not enough people
3802 2018-09-14 17:17:49 Unsaon pag stocks fel??
3803 2018-09-14 17:17:30 I can't find anything on it I can only find that a Canadian who invested $100,000 in US Cannabis stocks was denied entry. Which isnt surprising.
3804 2018-09-14 17:17:08 कल महिमा जी ने कहा था और आज ही 8.65 का level हिट किया. Super technical view 
3805 2018-09-14 17:16:47 Mainstream won’t even know about U stocks until the talking heads on TV mention it. Imho, that won’t happen until the broader markets start rolling over (at least here in the states) and everyone is looking for the “next” bull market to ride up
3806 2018-09-14 17:16:39 I don't get it though how as I'm crossing the border are they going to check to see where I invest stocks in, in Canada?
3807 2018-09-14 17:16:37 Recently seen few stocks with such move, sunpharma (632+) bpcl (334+) voltas
3808 2018-09-14 17:16:24 Question: would I really be better off buying gold for all these years and missing out on the returns from stocks?
3809 2018-09-14 17:15:35 I really thought good of Cube entertainment for some reason but after how they kicked #Hyuna and #Edawn and then took them back cuz their stocks dropped to the floor, I'm convinced that this is one of the lowest of lowest companies
3810 2018-09-14 17:15:29 Thats the part people dont understand. They are expecting xrp to grow over a decade like amazon or apple stocks. They are just not in the same category. Xrp can rocket up with a flip of a switch.
3811 2018-09-14 17:15:01 TTK PRESTIGE below 10 to 9000

You can list many stocks. But thing is many of us entered markets after 2010 or so

Next BULL market we may try to stick to stocks longer
3812 2018-09-14 17:14:35 If you buy such stocks based on such theories then I am afraid friend even God may not help you !!
3813 2018-09-14 17:14:16 "Grab all you can and let's escape to my cabin and eat in peace."

He does the same and stocks up a bunch of cakes as he silently withdrew and stealthy walked away.
3814 2018-09-14 17:14:08 I don’t want this conversation to go in the wrong direction I said I agree with you to a point no need for a contest you are correct in saying it’s to easy and quick to get one and bump stocks are now illegal I agree with that ,more we agree on then not.
3815 2018-09-14 17:14:04 HEADS UP: All Jordan Melo 13 launches are cancelled and reservations/stocks pulled back due to factory defects.
3816 2018-09-14 17:13:59 Pot stocks in panic mode right now. $CGC g/r. $CRON back to the dating game (singles). $TLRY getting annihilated.
3817 2018-09-14 17:13:38 You notice he has not said anything but if the stocks went down he would have been tweeting
3818 2018-09-14 17:13:11 without TV stocks would just go sideways
3819 2018-09-14 17:12:59 Just received a scholarship , passed my test , stocks going up. God is good
3820 2018-09-14 17:12:41 We're 9+ years into a bull market, with stocks looking expensive on traditional valuation metrics, interest rates rising, and margin debt at high levels. At 2900 on the S&P 500, I'm pretty bearish on the next few years.
3821 2018-09-14 17:12:36 Anyone who is looking or opened to investing in stocks, download the free Robinhood app and get started with your first free penny stock.
3822 2018-09-14 17:11:49 Hay que tipo pelotudo, hace 1 mes están reabriendo frigoríficos para exportar porque recién ahora están recomponiendo se los stocks va unos? 20 años trabaje en Comercio exterior, por las dudas no menciones Panamá Paper porque te doy vuelta como una media bobo!!
3823 2018-09-14 17:11:47 The govt stocks and wheat board sale was worth $30b a yr & forced JTs 20 yr deficits plan? I follow politics close & know nothing about the fishery libraries,  can u flip me a link on it plse? Wheat & all farm boards should end, & who cares it was sold, what's the negative?
3824 2018-09-14 17:11:43 Nike stocks at an all time high.  Looooool
3825 2018-09-14 17:11:33 I am writing a stock trend story for my business class. I'm looking for people that own stocks for the following companies: Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Big Lots, or Five Below. Feel free to message me #fivebelow #dollartree #dollargeneral #biglots
3826 2018-09-14 17:11:17 My bias got me too on same stocks in the morning. Looks like backside is now. $TLRY $CRON $CGC under VWAP now. $TLRY fading after it broke $110 without any pop
3827 2018-09-14 17:11:16 Making my crocs stocks look like shit smh
3828 2018-09-14 17:11:13 I've been happily working at this Call Center, Sitting on my rump getting fatter and making cash talking to people! Really, this is the first time I've ever had an influx of money this large. I suppose I'm going to try to invest it somewhere, Stocks or something Research required
3829 2018-09-14 17:11:06 idk how i would stay in a company knowing they were so quick to drop me & bring me back only because their stocks plummeted.
i feel like hyuna & edawn should look at the pro & cons, think about their future & decide what’s best for them but i don’t feel like they should stay
3830 2018-09-14 17:10:24 Every % damage you do to Isabelle you take 200% self-inflicted damage. Anytime you KO her it takes your own stocks.
3831 2018-09-14 17:10:23 Maybe it's your desire to keep learning and improving. Maybe the rule would be better adjusted to 'trade stocks over $10 with tiny size until the stats show me I am consistent'? Enjoy your birthday steaks man.
3832 2018-09-14 17:10:16 Why European bourse has scarcely recovered its level from that day and American one #standards has risen 225%!!!? #stocks
3833 2018-09-14 17:10:05 The basics to stock investing: Establish a valuation, and if you think that it can trend even higher, man that stocks a winner!
3834 2018-09-14 17:10:02 you do not reduce house prices via a fire sale of negative equity and repossessions. You do it through proper management of housing stocks, realistic long-term rentals and social housing.
3835 2018-09-14 17:09:54 Stay the Course, BOYCOTT NIKE. The stocks will fall again after this little bump.
3836 2018-09-14 17:09:40 Same here.. I stash money in crypto and stocks weekly to keep my cash on hand at a bare minimum. Cause I'll fuck around and buy some wild shit on impulse online..  actually  scoping the market as we speak.
3837 2018-09-14 17:08:55 Wet & joy people might not have taken entry fee ...for the tweet or might you would have advised some stocks to invest
3838 2018-09-14 17:08:12 Get real!  Yeah, it came from a WH email. No! Opens paper. Read the fing news. It was delivered to Diane Feinstein in July. She met with him with this letter in her possession. She questioned him with it in her possession. Just stop. Like the stocks, u r buying trash. Be better.
3839 2018-09-14 17:07:46 Almost all sugar stocks rallied, not all will sustain of course.
3840 2018-09-14 17:07:38 And you know they had investors ready to buy up stocks when it dropped. Now they can sell off slowly and pretend it had nothing to do with the ad.
3841 2018-09-14 17:07:18 I'm screaming cube things they can just press the undo button because the stocks dropped even if dawn and HyunA get to stay nobody will be able to trust the company
3842 2018-09-14 17:06:25 Stocks don't trend downward very easily in an economy with GDP growth over 4% especially in a more mature stock
3843 2018-09-14 17:05:50 Prediction: 

Over the next year, people will become distracted by the media frenzy around weed stocks and finally give up on crypto as it continues to fall. 

This will be the perfect time to buy back into $BTC. Biggest bear market is still to come before the stable rise begins.
3844 2018-09-14 17:03:43 hey cube ent pinagiisipan pa ba yan kung aalisin nyo silang dalawa eh pag inalis nyo silang dalawa ung stocks nyo say byebye ahhaha skl
3845 2018-09-14 17:03:31 Insult him all you want. He’s doing more for me and my family that the one before him and my stocks are up! People need to realize he’s running this like a business and it’s working. Insult our pay raise and I’ll invite you to do my job for what I make
3846 2018-09-14 17:03:22 this is because most leading stocks are overbot on monthly chart, hence daily is squeezing higher.. maybe by next year the good old bear can catch its load of Salmon  lol $SPY
3847 2018-09-14 17:02:32 Harper destroyed the fisheries libraries leaving no record of scientific research on restocking those supplies and now east coasters are losing both livelihood and a means of survival. Also Harper sold government stocks and the Wheat Board to avoid a deficit in his last year
3848 2018-09-14 17:02:08 Your view on these stocks please
3849 2018-09-14 17:02:00 When you hear your buddy Rick brag about his stock-picking exploits, remember that he's not telling you about the time when he lost his house and wife shorting penny stocks.
3850 2018-09-14 17:01:57 Exactly. I’m still going to act broke when I’m not to save money and continue adding in my stocks. When i think i have it i spend it
3851 2018-09-14 17:01:26 The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of all stocks so when you hear the market’s at an all-time high it’s kinda like hearing your boss’s boss’s boss got a promotion for more money.
3852 2018-09-14 17:00:35 Just had a 401k meeting and put 10 more stocks in that shit 
3853 2018-09-14 17:00:10 Stock drop: $NI and 5 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #NI
3854 2018-09-14 16:59:55 You are confused Annie. All I have to do is look at my stocks and 401k. Feel sorry for you if you believe that.
3855 2018-09-14 16:59:42 Sure the Nike thing with Kap was a money play just as much as it was sending a statement that he won’t be shut up. And it feels great to know that Nike is at an all time high in stocks.
3856 2018-09-14 16:59:37 Have long term no touch stocks but started playing options this year. End of Jan if you'd believe it...

Talk about poor timing. Haha
3857 2018-09-14 16:59:18 Stocks have been buoyed, obviously by monetary policy that borders on #theft and fiscal policy tied to cronyism ... what if, even slightly, that changes (if even for self-preservation) and becomes more Main Street friendly? There is A LOT of #theftpremium in stocks! #BeWarned
3858 2018-09-14 16:58:59 American stocks also got hit after Trump comment...
3859 2018-09-14 16:58:27 Reduced to Penny stocks. What a looser shittron
3860 2018-09-14 16:58:21 this is a must. Almost every single one of them are usually very heavily weighted towards individual stocks throw in a short or 2 so they sound smart and keep lots of cash at an opportunity cost a middle class person cannot bare.
3861 2018-09-14 16:56:54 en la galeria del optico tal vez corrientes y libertad, hace mucho no voy pero suelen tener todo un toque mas barato y tienen stocks de cosas del año del jopo
3862 2018-09-14 16:55:27 Buy lumber stocks.
3863 2018-09-14 16:54:50 Your sex appeal stocks just fell by 20 points according to Bloomberg, WSJ.
3864 2018-09-14 16:54:14 Really like @HalftimeReport lots of good substance... actual substance about a variety of stocks..
3865 2018-09-14 16:54:05 Ya man-Im with that-stocks are up!
3866 2018-09-14 16:53:51 Guess you have no idea about stocks. Market was in uptrend and sales from one day doesn’t matter till next quarter. That’s when we will see the outcome.
3867 2018-09-14 16:53:32 They better promote hyuna to CEO their stocks would skyrocket
3868 2018-09-14 16:53:26 stocks is stocks

There’s Artists, Digital Artists, Fitness Streamers, IRL streamers, Talk Shows, Musicians, in fact there’s even a category called Stocks and Bonds. What’s your real deal?
3870 2018-09-14 16:53:06 @SenateGOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @SenWarren So much for the stocks today as you allow the POTUS to impose new tariffs. Stocks are losing now. They started green. I think you better start doing something

As his business stocks fall due to rise in dollar prices.
3872 2018-09-14 16:52:16 The stocks which gained less usually would have been trading at a high IV when there was fear/ uncertainty in them.  When the upmove happens, the uncertainty allays, which drastically reduces IV. 

Usually stocks which fell quite a bit in the last few sessions have high IV

3896 2018-09-14 16:45:12 @realDonaldTrump it appears that @Nike stocks have risen since making @Kaepernick7 their #spokesperson. How does it feel knowing that you are a horrible president, who doesn't know a deal when he sees it.
3897 2018-09-14 16:45:03 One thing about this far left movement is that if they legalize/decriminalize/reschedule Marijuana, my MMJ stocks will pay off my student loans.
3898 2018-09-14 16:44:47 i love how the maga people think that their “boycotts” have an iota of relevance. you know, like nike stocks being at a record high right now..
3899 2018-09-14 16:44:35 It is time to stand up to @CitronResearch
They damage good companies for self profit. We must fight back. They are short stocks and pump them with negative news on Twitter - BUT do not disclose any short position on Twitter - maybe not illegal - BUT highly unethical. Email SEC!!
3900 2018-09-14 16:44:19 I’m taking my buying/ trading talents to @RobinhoodApp They have more cannabis stocks on there

3902 2018-09-14 16:43:47 stocks rise by 1%.
3903 2018-09-14 16:43:41 Sometimes you put money where you know it's right to do whether you get a return or not. This is also how charities work. Clean energy, multiplanetary life, EVs are more important than somebody losing their money in stocks. The stock market is anyways a big gamble.
3904 2018-09-14 16:43:18 I said I would sell my stocks when they hit 150$ but I’m just going to wait until they hit 160$

3906 2018-09-14 16:42:01 If you invest in cannabis stocks I'd keep a close eye on how news (good & bad) affects overall prices & volume. Strong seasonal cannabis uptrend may give it's last early opportunities for solid entries soon.
3907 2018-09-14 16:41:35 I got first hand experience of many a corporate hospitals in India in connection to my parents treatment. It's complete rot. Blood money... as a principle never invested in a hospital stock & very reluctant about pharma stocks also seeing their nexus.

3910 2018-09-14 16:41:29 Yea it’s been a few months. We’ve been asking GPS to switch to Emerade pens but don’t know how long stocks of that will last.
3911 2018-09-14 16:41:21 Je suis fort heureux. En revanche, pourquoi 2022 lorsqu’on sait que ce genre de choses peut-être mis en œuvre immédiatement? Le temps d’écouler les stocks
3912 2018-09-14 16:41:19 At least  we will have invested in crypto before investing in anything else. Imagine trading regular stocks with no experience.

3921 2018-09-14 16:36:47 @JamesGRickards this is why sell now or forever going to be proud stock owner. #Crypto fallout ---> #stocks fallout. Buy when you hear canon, sell when you hear champagne pops. Buy #DXY , Buy #ADXY, Buy #Gold.
3922 2018-09-14 16:36:42 Luckily, Trump's tariff announcement came on Friday ... Friday means there are a lot more parties interested in propping up stocks for short term gains! Eventually, however, this gets run over by reality!

3943 2018-09-14 16:26:38 @realDonaldTrump will be the reason the stocks crash. We need @BarackObama back. His previous policies brought this market up. @realDonaldTrump policies bring us down and will effect future markets -

3961 2018-09-14 16:21:08 Perhaps @Nike 's record high has something to do with @realDonaldTrump 's economic policies and tax reform.  Due to this, the American tax payer has more disposable income to purchase @Nike 's goods and stocks.  Thank YOUR president @democrats .

4004 2018-09-14 16:07:38 Right... if you don’t own stocks, you don’t get any benefit.   Military, teachers, most labor workers, don’t own stocks. Plus GM, Ford, GE, Exxon, Chevron... they are not doing good at all.
4005 2018-09-14 16:07:34 I'm starting to love this guy @kcprinters for making sure I don't miss any of these IPO madness stocks. Puts them all on my screen and reminds me the day of and the day before that certain ones are good ones!

4020 2018-09-14 16:03:55 What does the whole Nike stock fiasco show us? It shows us just how volatile stock market is... folks stop investing in something that you literally have to focus on every minute of the day or you lose everything potential.

4041 2018-09-14 15:56:04 No trades for me this week. It's been stocks under a $1 running, or stocks with high float/market cap running. Neither are my niche. I rather sit on my hands than trade stocks I have no edge in.
4042 2018-09-14 15:55:55 Stocks dropped
4043 2018-09-14 15:55:52 Or... stocks are complicated financial instruments, that’s price is variable due to multiple reasons, including the company buying back shares to boost stock price
4044 2018-09-14 15:55:36 Their stocks are worth a trillion but that doesn't mean they have a trillion in the bank. Tens of 1000's of people own those stocks, not just Apple employees. But yeah, $1 million is very small compared to the projected $170 billion in damages expected.

4046 2018-09-14 15:55:08 Given the way the market's been behaving (constant rotation), isn't having a relatively small share of S&P 500 stocks making 52-week highs actually relatively bullish?

4058 2018-09-14 15:50:20 The younger you are the more weighted to stocks your portfolio should be. 

As you age the more you can add bonds and other less volatile asset classes as you will likely want to keep your investment portfolio as stable as possible.

4059 2018-09-14 15:49:40 I also support that, it just blows that people are out there celebrating nike stocks going up as tho nike actually gives a fuck abt their political stance
4060 2018-09-14 15:49:25 Taking a look at something similar to that today. It's *extremely* rare to see the Russell so near a high with so few of its stocks > moving averages, and so many others sitting at their lows.

4074 2018-09-14 15:42:48 It’s not just a bull market, it’s the Fusion Super Bull Market that has done much better. It’s not the popular fads that are lagging: emerging markets, hedge funds, value investing. That means, unless you know the stocks of the Super Bull, you won’t know the changing economy..
4075 2018-09-14 15:42:05 That way, no other generation will ever buy stocks, a house or even retire properly, because they'll be in too much debt.
4076 2018-09-14 15:42:04 If the govt used Novichok then PD was involved. If the govt didn't use Novichok then PD lied and said it was used. The OPCW accredits PD, so they too must be involved, either by lying or to falsify stocks of a banned substance.

4134 2018-09-14 15:23:18 groupthink by trying to get people from different cultures.  To go back to the market example, I have much less risk if I pick 50 random stocks across the S&P 500 than if I pick 50 in the same industry.  Same with people.

4139 2018-09-14 15:20:29 It would explain your recent hot streak in calling stocks 
4140 2018-09-14 15:20:28 but it was still being sold by hot topic who stocks their official merch..?
4141 2018-09-14 15:20:06 Check out Stash, it’s an app that’s really cool that has all the stocks in there and you get five dollars for signing up. Going through brokers usually needs a minimum of $1000

4144 2018-09-14 15:19:43 stocks drop and internet goes crazy now cube’s ceo said that “were discussing the issue but it’s not finalized, the opinions of the artists are also important so it needs to be handled carefully, we’ll have a board meeting next week to discuss the issue” 
4145 2018-09-14 15:19:19 These new Chinese stocks are climbing 60-80% daily bc of a recent US invitation and I wanna get in it but fuuuuuuuuck it sucks losing 10%+ and having to regain it
4146 2018-09-14 15:19:17 Sir markets work on EPS. Co eps going up but country’s eps in negative. China and USA are not listed naa then u would have seen how there stocks perform 
4147 2018-09-14 15:19:16 You can do it through stockbroker or on your own with an app. I suggest you start out on Stash. It’s an app and it has all stocks you can search around on and you get $5 for starting up
4148 2018-09-14 15:19:11 @JeffBezos can you just go ahead and buy Twitter, @realDonaldTrump tweets something about Amazon the stocks dip 4-5% from a tweet. Why not send him back to Facebook!  #nomoretweetingfortrump
4149 2018-09-14 15:18:41 I don't necessarily agree. It's been my experience that in these days of easily monitored insider trading, stocks often close up on very light volume the day before bad news drops (and vice-versa).
4150 2018-09-14 15:18:18 Classic Clay. He knew damn well Nike stocks dipping on that day wasn’t indicative of the long term. He simply pounced on an opportunity to discredit and slander Kaepernick to a base that lacks the intellect to know any better.
4151 2018-09-14 15:18:14 Yeah it’s called buy low sell high that’s what investors do when stocks take a dump and then when they buy it guess what happens the stock goes up. But keep pushing and thinking it’s cuz of social justice.
4152 2018-09-14 15:17:53 That's only possible when the bachelor stocks up on food stuff. Eating out, 20k is nothing.

4181 2018-09-14 15:04:45 Sorry to hear you missed out - we increase our stocks dramatically on such offer days, but as you can imagine, we never know exactly how many people will come to store, so these offers are always on a first come, first served basis. Hope you get to try these treats soon.
4182 2018-09-14 15:04:28 I wish people realized this about heartburn lol. But re: chicken stock - that pissed me off more than anything, ended up being the reason I make my own stocks now.

Saying US stocks will fall 20% & emerging market stocks will be cut in half, they've pegged 2020 for when the collapse will happen.

4222 2018-09-14 14:48:56 I still haven’t seen investment properties perform better than stocks in the long run. I assume the graph uses housing to compare because many people believe and think that their house is an investment and or only rent to it to others. This is especially true for Canadians.
4223 2018-09-14 14:48:52 @Tesco which of ur London stores stocks the cans of Espresso Martinis? Been in about 5 and none stock them 
4224 2018-09-14 14:48:16 Stocks prices have outperformed housing values, sure. But its misleading because almost everyone who has a stock is making an investment, only, but the vast majority of people don't do that for housing.

4338 2018-09-14 14:12:06 If you entered near 30, then definitely keep it. I consider marijuana stocks safe and a good long term investment. But what I'm saying is at this price action is scary and people getting in at 100$ just 2 months after launch are definitely going to feel the pain.

4344 2018-09-14 14:11:01 This makes no sense, considering there are plenty of Americans that have invested in marijuana stocks and businesses right here in the U.S. It's time to change this silly policy. Marijuana is a legitimate business and it's here to stay.

4542 2018-09-14 13:02:13 the Professor has been opining since 2015 that stocks were too high (always w caveats "it may go higher") according to his CAP Index (10 yr. avg. S&P earnings)..as 2018-19 earnings of $160 and $179 replace the 2008-9 trough earnings $55 and $68, his Index gets more reasonable...

4554 2018-09-14 12:57:08 There’s 2 ways to increase a portfolio’s expected return w/o using selection and timing:

(1) Hold more stocks than bonds:
Bloomberg Intermediate Bond Index = +6.9%
CRSP 1-10 Index = +10.5%

(2) Hold higher returning stocks:
DFA US Small Value Index = +15.9%

4580 2018-09-14 12:44:47 The reality is the pot stocks are grotesquely over-valued. Approaching Oct 17 & once the chaos & dysfunction after October 17 is seen, they will drop much further. Much further. Pot stocks are a Ponzi scheme.
4581 2018-09-14 12:44:05 As I said they would ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Although, equities at a whole are rallying. S&P's on the brink of record-highs again. Just because stocks are doing well doesn't mean their isn't a now, on some level, disenfranchised consumer base. Some %, however small, will go somewhere else.

4589 2018-09-14 12:41:23 Just read on BBC website a comment that buy to let investors should be taxed.

Just to summarise;

They are likely to pay 3% tax on purchase price.

Rent received is taxable

Capital gains likely to be taxable.

Property is (imo) one of the least tax effective investments around!
4590 2018-09-14 12:40:51 Nah..

4649 2018-09-14 12:15:07 So some people were put off by the Nike add guess what, Nike stock closed at an all time high yesterday. The day the stocks supposedly fell all stocks fell that day. So as many are put off by the protest there are also many who agree. So keep your suggestions.

4705 2018-09-14 11:48:02 it'll need a spark to ignite it. Record debts/deficits/valuations, trade, currencies, countries on verge of something happening, et.c, nothing phases it. Gold and VIX show know fear other than fear of missing out on stocks advancing. So far these bets have been failures

4710 2018-09-14 11:46:18 Bitcoin shouldn't be compared to company stocks at all. It's hard money and should be compared to world gold and USD reserves.

4713 2018-09-14 11:44:59 I respectfully disagree, however I can see that it does not conform to your rules. 

As an aside, I use twitter to check sentiment surrounding stocks and my IOG tweets only get ~10 interactions on most of them. More off the radar than the price might suggest

Not so much for me tho

4779 2018-09-14 11:05:31 How long have you been calling in stocks to crash since 2008? You’ll be right on 10 of the last 1 crash when it does.
4780 2018-09-14 11:05:14 The ad, which you apparently haven’t seen in its entirety, features various athletes, professional and amateur, engaging in sport. It ends with Colin. Nike’s stocks are at an all-time high. It’s hard to reason with someone who tweets to “deport illegal aliens”
4781 2018-09-14 11:04:06 Hope every outraged Trump supporter sold their Nike stock last week.  Yesterday, it hit an all-time high.  Oh, who am I kidding?... No Trump supporter is solvent enough to buy and sell stocks... let alone afford a used pair of Nikes.
4782 2018-09-14 11:04:05 Dear SM.

I know Cube is much worst than you but bruh will you let Oh!GG promote on music shows!? They do well in charts but they can do better when you give them proper promotion. They can also raise your stocks. It's kinda unfair for them really.
4783 2018-09-14 11:03:42 The dollar headed for its worst weekly loss since February following slowing inflation data out of the US & amid bets that other major central banks will start to normalize monetary policies, helping global stocks extend their lead as the MSCI All-Country World Index gained 0.3%.

4788 2018-09-14 11:00:38 UEC had a great trend and volume the last few days and that is true for URG (up $0.20 in 30 days or 29%).  The same trend is true for NXE.  Western Resources is staying near is resent surge to new highs.  Maybe the stocks will realize the $27+ price is real and only going higher?

Expect more puking on the automatic platforms until then. If you are looking for a cheeky long punt, hold off on the BUY button until then.
4808 2018-09-14 10:50:20 Like nike really has good intentions linking up with that ex qb guy. Every time their stocks increase, they have to hire more child labor. How ironic. Way to think this thru Nike train hoppers

4833 2018-09-14 10:38:04 If I shorted stocks, I’d short Nike right after they report earnings.

The controversy probably drove an unsustainable bubble of short-term sales that will drive shares even higher. Unless they keep up the antics, reversion to the mean is likely as people forget this whole mess.

4907 2018-09-14 09:34:04 What's the likely downside in the next financial implosion, say in 2 years!

1 EM stocks down by ½ & currencies down by 15%
2 Energy & metals prices down by ⅓-½
3 US corporate borrowing yield up a %

Not alarming like the past, but severe at current levels.

4914 2018-09-14 09:29:32 Face value of stocks traded in BSE/NSE.
Face value of companies differ from companies to companies. 
It is Rs.1, 2, 5, 10, 100 ect.
Time to time, it is changed among companies. 
This is confusing & fooling the investors. 
Hence it should be made uniform.
4915 2018-09-14 09:29:04 I’m a huge fan of buying unloved stocks with strong fundamentals. Even better when there has been a market overreaction and subsequent share price drop. Topped up #tlou with 200k shares and now looking forward to sentiment building again and the management delivering.

4940 2018-09-14 09:03:01 Fake spike, will fall again, public sector stocks are government's personal wallet, execution rate is pathetic no matter how good the order book is, scrip has lost more than half of its value in a year. Amrapali price pressure will further cause issues for NBCC.
4941 2018-09-14 09:01:44 It is correct that Sandoz stopped distributing #LSD in 1964. However, @NIMHgov was given all of their LSD stocks (several kilos). Additionally, the patent for LSD had expired and there were other pharmaceutical companies that produced LSD in 1965, in Italy for example.
4942 2018-09-14 09:00:51 When someone who works for a company takes funds or property from the company, takes it for himself or gives it to his red haired girlfriend it is called embezzlement. (The stocks Bill gave Steffy were his, not Spencer Pub’s property) Liam could have been put in jail.

4947 2018-09-14 08:54:29 H.

4950 2018-09-14 08:50:18 Size of stocks can be considered, but #CFPreality requires all stocks (i.e. 100% of the number of stocks) to be restored to health. Ernesto Jardim explains why: some stocks may be small, but they can also be valuable, ecologically important, etc. #EndOverfishing #EUFishEcon

4957 2018-09-14 08:44:30 I'm a new follower. Don't know your time frames and targets. Its just that there are lots of other stocks with bigger upside potential. This one seems like it would be a slow mover. Am I wrong?
4958 2018-09-14 08:44:23 Crypto has always had more violent swings than stocks, plus it has recovered from this level of crash twice before. Bulls are positive because they understand that despite the uncertainty & manipulation the underlying investment sector is legitimate
4959 2018-09-14 08:43:25 Indeed! It means we have to deal with overexploitation of 40% of the NE Atlantic fish stocks and #EndOverfishing by #CFP2020 deadline. Will @EU_MARE together with EU #AGRIFISH make it on time? #EUFishEcon

4968 2018-09-14 08:38:54 I used to pay 3-10 cents just to borrow the shares to short on small cap stocks. That’s a $3,000-$10,000 feel just to borrow 100K shares. With tradenet I no longer have to worry about finding shares to short and I don’t have to pay the insane HTB fees with other brokers

4980 2018-09-14 08:25:59 It's better to concentrate on a few selected good stocks rather than many. Because the gains of your good stocks will be evaporated by any losses that you make on bad stocks. Gains of the positive stocks will be cancelled out by the negative stocks. Increases chance of loss.

4989 2018-09-14 08:16:20 But they have their stocks folded up all nice and neat.
4990 2018-09-14 08:15:13 People always focus on extreme points of stocks [High's & Low's] but ignore the middle point.

Many a time opportunity exists in this "mystic middle point".Try to figure out this.

4997 2018-09-14 08:10:26 If you’re thinking pot stocks you’re already behind, start looking into the (mostly clandestine) research in hallucinogenic/dissociative drugs.
4998 2018-09-14 08:10:02 Don't worry about the minor nuances of investing or trading, just focus on core principles and strategies that seem timeless. This could apply to #stocks, #commodities, #bonds, #cryptocurrency, and even #forex. 

In the end markets and exchanges are all the same.

5005 2018-09-14 08:05:03 And if MSY ref points are not available, @EU_MARE should ask for them, or for appropriate proxies. And in the meantime those stocks should be even more protected, rather than more overexploited as is currently the case... #EndOverfishing

5134 2018-09-14 06:38:35 @CNBC Jim Cramer is ~88% of CNBC for Independent Investors. He's Uncovered more 1,000% stocks since 2013 than ~93% of All other Wildebeest. Cramer is a Heavyweight among Featherweights. High Praise to a stock picking "Eagle", Jim Cramer. As Ever, R. Pig Grabowski
5135 2018-09-14 06:38:06 Understand from top Indian Textile exporters, Chinese companies are shit scared of the threat of tariffs being imposed by US and they are winding down their stocks. Situation is quite grim in China. Threats from @realDonaldTrump seem to be working.
5136 2018-09-14 06:37:26 WTF country are you living in? My middle class family is living on an all time low income thanks to your tax cut we are paying more taxes. My stocks are unstable and my tuition just doubled!
5137 2018-09-14 06:36:38 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
5138 2018-09-14 06:35:03 Share market update: Sugar stocks extend winning streak, zoom up to 20%
5139 2018-09-14 06:32:55 1.) Thanks mate. Hi Simon I'd be really cautious in just buying random cryptos from an exchange. There's much more to it than that. Bit like just buying a random stock won't do much good. Most people lose with stocks. Same for cryptos. Need to know when to exit & what to exit to.
5140 2018-09-14 06:32:42 I have a VPN, I need to invest in their stocks too?
5141 2018-09-14 06:32:30 @SaraEisen Jim Cramer is 88% of CNBC for Independent Investors. He's Uncovered more 1,000% stocks since 2013 than 93% of the Wildebeest that appear on CNBC. Cramer is a Heavyweight amongst Featherweights, period. High Praise to a well-meaning stock picking Giant.
5142 2018-09-14 06:32:15 lmao not @ how cube was about to fire Hyuna and Hyojong but the fans were coming together to TKO their asses into the next fucking galaxy so ow they saying they were 'just considering it' hA y'all just don't want ya stocks to drop cube aint fooling nobody #CubeIsCancelled
5143 2018-09-14 06:31:53 You know - one day when i a billionaire, I’m going to buy enough stocks in @Netflix to be on the board.
Then as first act I’m going to fire the entire writing team for what they’ve done to Danny Rand and the iron fist @MarvelIronFist 

Good god
5144 2018-09-14 06:31:49 don’t hesitate for too long bc she might not have enough stocks
5145 2018-09-14 06:31:37 We book profits very quickly and let the losses run and when it becomes unbearable we throw the stocks at whatever price we get and normally that is the very point the stock reverses action & we get surprised. This is all crowd psychology and how to identify n benefit from it.
5146 2018-09-14 06:31:05 Just tell me what “for us it’s personal” means if you are JLP shopper when outof stocks in Waitrose are appalling and JL service has slipped!
5147 2018-09-14 06:29:45 forex is plain boring to me idk and the concept of leverage makes me stay away honestly lol and crypto is the same as stocks. I know I could make alotta money but it doesn't interest me enough
5148 2018-09-14 06:28:05 You know I never get on twitter anymore need to watch my mouth you know politics but today I could not help it I tweeted President POT STOCKS lost $$$$$$$ 1 day, sucks. Did not know I had such HOT follower. You know hounddog died.
5149 2018-09-14 06:23:27 And Cube's stocks also dropped so hard when Hyuna and E'Dawn's relationship was revealed. They lost as much money as they're losing now. So of course they thought that the solution would be kicking them out.
5150 2018-09-14 06:22:29 May be it was at the back of mind .. Why I reviewed Sugar Stocks on 29Aug18 ?

5155 2018-09-14 06:19:26 Cutting tax rates don't do nothing but buy back stocks. Apple 250 million didn't hire anybody...leaving money overseas and  charging 1k for iPhone doesn't create more jobs ... US corps are hoarding billions of dollars .. just like the Wal-Mart Waltons.
5156 2018-09-14 06:19:06 @realDonaldTrump I walk away from 430,000.00 to get in the stock market I thought Hillary was going to be the witch in charge.

5157 2018-09-14 06:18:51 I would be looking for an exit. Don't like health stocks to start with and APN is maturing fast which  should result in lower valuations (PE at simple level)

5166 2018-09-14 06:14:08 @applebeans OFffffFfff. Apparently Cube's stocks dropped when they said they were going to drop HyunA and that was why they retracted their statement

5169 2018-09-14 06:10:04 Stop lying. Without a stiff top marginal tax rate all your cuts for the wealthy are doomed to fail and kill the middle class. The wealthy are far more incentivized under the current system to hold it or gamble on stocks than invest in growing their company or paying higher wages.
5170 2018-09-14 06:09:59 Looking at the stocks exchange to gauge economic prosperity is so so wrong! Indexes is easy to manipulate as long as a substantial amount of capital is pump in to prep and make it look good. To "LOOK GOOD" without substance is horrible. To see this play out will definitely be SAD

Thank you!
5204 2018-09-14 05:49:32 I have seen so many wannabe "investors" invest just their "money" in stocks.

Alas, if they were to invest "time" in researching stocks before investing, their returns would be substantially different.

Invest time in your investing.

5271 2018-09-14 05:02:30 Yep Dean is right. Correlation is not causation. The fund managers I've spoken to have said that they are just not finding it easy to find stocks that meet the criteria they've set. They could "lower the bar", but that's probably asking for trouble.

5344 2018-09-14 04:24:50 I think it makes Cube look even worse if they decide to keep Hyuna and E'Dawn at this point, when it's clear that the only reason they retracted their original decision was because their stocks dropped MASSIVELY.

Cube doesn't deserve either of them at this point.
5345 2018-09-14 04:23:53 S&P 500 is at an all time high. Most stocks are hitting ATH. This has nothing to do with Kap/Trump as Nike was hitting ATH before any of that news.

5347 2018-09-14 04:22:46 the reason why cube is having their board meeting next week is for Finance to observe whether the stocks have stop falling or rather have increased during the next week. Otherwise, they'll simply boot them out

5367 2018-09-14 04:10:11 If you can’t define the risk of your trade, don’t make it. Have a plan and execute it. Trading off of price action and key support/resistance not only increase your knowledge of the stocks potential, but it allows you to keep losses short if you’re wrong

5386 2018-09-14 03:57:17 People in general seem to be happy with overdiagnosis. I always hear "thank god they picked up that nodule, and they took it out. fortunately it was not cancer." so you may wanna buy Apple stocks
5387 2018-09-14 03:56:15 alam mo ba binabawi agad ng cube yan di daw confirmed the second their stocks started dropping hdjdjddj

5395 2018-09-14 03:52:17 stocks are the wayyyy to goooo
5396 2018-09-14 03:51:44 the worst part of all this is CUBE ENT. They decided to support those ignorant people and kick out their most popular artists.
But they're holding back their decision now JUST BECAUSE THEIR STOCKS DROPPED.
????????????????????? qjzjxjcjxzc I'm sorry what????
5397 2018-09-14 03:50:59 I heard about pharma lobby from Dr. Hegade. Confused should I buy those stocks.
5398 2018-09-14 03:50:54 From my understanding they made the official statement that they were out but then after their stocks plummeted they backtracked saying it wasn't final. Basically they don't care about their artists just their profit margin.
5399 2018-09-14 03:50:47 Wow my friend just put me ON to the stocks & investing game. I’m hype
5400 2018-09-14 03:50:26 @NZRugby Nice to see you promoting the @BlackFerns but keep trying to buy some official supporter gear and can't. The All Black Shop stocks close to 200 men's team items of clothing but only 1 item of @BlackFerns . Not ONE item for the World Cup 15s team! #explain
5401 2018-09-14 03:48:52 They may yes and people should lie if they invest.  But next level whack would be if they ask you to prove not owning pot stocks by making you log into your online banking so they can check your self-directed investment portfolio lol
5402 2018-09-14 03:48:03 @HarrisFootball I was 80%, but now I’m 100% with you on Alex Collins. No wiggle, no stop/go, little athleticism, and unremarkable speed. He is JAG. Trusted you enough to own 0 stocks in him but this game was good confirmation. #tapeworm

5408 2018-09-14 03:45:00 it doesn’t take a genius or even a fan of either cube, hyuna, or hyojong to realize that cube is over. cube’s stocks are down in the dirt and they handelled the situation terribly causing all of this drama to erupt.
5409 2018-09-14 03:44:33 biglang bawi???hahaha.because there stocks went downhill that's why tskk...tskk....CUBE is an hypocrite.They don't deserve them though especially Hyuna-Eonnie....
5410 2018-09-14 03:43:37 Andy, you in the right place now if you want to learn how to trade stocks, options and listen to Pat, when he said you should it slow if you are new to trading, Pat is a great mentor and he has the best chatroom, Kelvo72 and Moses are a great helper too.
5411 2018-09-14 03:43:22 Wages up. Unemployment down. Taxes down. Stocks up.  Why are we having this discussion about losing seats? The press hi lights and looks for the negative while ignoring the achievements.  It’s that simple.
5412 2018-09-14 03:43:03 So don't ever joke about or even mention the B word in a airport ..Got it. And now don't mention the Pot stocks you bought either..Got it
5413 2018-09-14 03:42:56 Cube got scared, said nothing had been made official yet. Probably saw their stocks dropping
5414 2018-09-14 03:41:31 U.S. Market Check

-Gains in the information technology and health care sectors helped to propel U.S. stocks higher for a fourth day.
-The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.97 percent.

5421 2018-09-14 03:39:16 I can see the future and the future I see is Cube's stocks are plummeting to the ground. It could even go underground if they keep up with this stupidity. I feel bad for both Hyuna and Hyojong. As well as the remaining artists who are stuck in that shif of a company.

5426 2018-09-14 03:32:20 And trump and his cronies are striving every day to recreate it. They get rich on shorting stocks and manipulating the housing market, the rest of us get screwed.
5427 2018-09-14 03:31:41 Im waiting to bet it all on turnip stocks. Gonna become a turnip mogul.

5429 2018-09-14 03:29:48 @realDonaldTrump. Nike stocks at an all time high!  What will you tell us tmrw?  Maybe they dropped 100 pts?  Maybe the sky is purple?  Maybe you are not a huge whore?
5430 2018-09-14 03:29:42 Camsoda stocks going up huh lol
5431 2018-09-14 03:28:39 When a stock story goes wrong and market remains bearish on it due to overhanging upcoming triggers, one should let stock consolidate rather than keep getting excited on small technical moves. Happening in at least two #Nifty stocks.
5432 2018-09-14 03:28:06 I think Darren knows well enough to know stocks are taken into consideration quarterly and yearly to show full impact. This is tweet baiting.
5433 2018-09-14 03:27:38 When you see people who have no idea how common stocks work use the all time high market price of (Nike, the S&P, the Dow, etc.) as a premise in an argument you know a bubble is forming.
5434 2018-09-14 03:27:21 But every country singer in the world was telling us how Nike dropped 3 points the day it was announced, even when other stocks were down the same that day too.
5435 2018-09-14 03:27:18 I prefer to get EM/FM exposure via bonds not stocks...
5436 2018-09-14 03:26:04 700k Net worth in Nov of last year, according to JoeMas. Then you lose it all, have garbage stocks now, tweet NOTHING on any investment site.

5437 2018-09-14 03:25:48 @BMTheEquityDesk sir please suggest some good books for reading wrt identifying stocks and analysing them
5438 2018-09-14 03:25:31 But then again this is my opinion too
People can agree or disagree about this
I made my decision based on things and the possibilities i see in the products i invest
Whether it is stocks or digital assets or commodities
People have their reasons

5440 2018-09-14 03:25:10 and y'know all these chinese $IPO stocks coming into us markets just going to help this bubble blow, while trump too busy trash talking the country via trade war
5441 2018-09-14 03:24:51 A 20% dip would be even greater as it would trigger margin calls all the way down. Those buybacks will come into scrutiny. 

Stocks will never go down again.

5461 2018-09-14 03:13:29 One month ago, Tilray $TLRY was a $25 stock.

5464 2018-09-14 03:12:18 Yo that’s dope. I’m trying to get into stocks but don’t know where to start
5465 2018-09-14 03:11:57 Good news! 
MSCI EM Index upgrades Malaysia stocks to equal-weight, more equity support coming!
5466 2018-09-14 03:11:37 Invested a little over a grand in some stocks and I’m itching to invest some more 
5467 2018-09-14 03:10:13 You honestly think the money guys begin weed stocks are potheads?
5468 2018-09-14 03:09:45 Canadians who invest in marijuana-related stocks, as well as those who use pot or work in the cannabis industry, could be banned from ever entering the U.S. according to report. If so what about U.S traders ??????
5469 2018-09-14 03:06:52 My preference is no support class; but will tolerate 1 support class.  Not a big fan of street stocks, pure stocks, factory stocks...especially when they can't run a lap w/out a caution.  Keep the program to 3 hours.
5470 2018-09-14 03:04:25 Certainly does. Stocks are perception driven. People think the value is going to go up so they buy. If they bought Kaep’s deal was a negative people would sell and the price would drop.
5471 2018-09-14 03:03:20 And because they didn’t forsee that they loss more amount of money by kicking out Hyuna, they thought it will raise their stocks. So they keep holding Hyuna now. If I am Hyuna, let Cube make their own name, you’re the one who kicked me out.
5472 2018-09-14 03:03:14 Guess learning about stocks/trades is something in my to-do list. Might as well let my money grow while I’m gone
5473 2018-09-14 03:02:32 Do not make the list of enemy stocks. You will probably end up loving noone. Identify and understand the habit of stock and make a friendship. You will be automatically shifted to the list of successful traders.
5474 2018-09-14 03:02:05 Yea baby, let’s bring back the stocks in the public square...are you kidding?
5475 2018-09-14 03:01:55 The American border protectors do know that there are weed stocks listed on US exchanges too?
5476 2018-09-14 03:01:14 Couple good penny stocks to watch for right now are PLM, Dogecoin, and EPE. PLM doing really good lately and rn going down so is a good time to buy and dogecoin is cheap af and going up everyday so definitely a good time to get into that as well

5491 2018-09-14 02:51:55 Saw a headline today that said, "Nearly half of Americans are not benefiting from the stock market." Well, heck, that means more than half ARE. I actually thought the % of people in stocks was much lower.
5492 2018-09-14 02:51:43 Isn't @adidas wrecking @Nike stocks right now?
5493 2018-09-14 02:50:40 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well. - Warren Buffet
5494 2018-09-14 02:48:31 No one told you to shut up and just pick stocks for those of us who can't do our own research?  On a serious note, marijuana in the young man's apartment is completely irrelevant.  An off duty cop at his door, murdering him is 100% relevant.
5495 2018-09-14 02:48:30 jeff bezos’ net worth is highly determined by the prices of Amazon’s stocks. the price of Amazon’s stocks are highly determined by the success and potential of Amazon. stop tripping cause this man created a successful company. those billions aren’t guaranteed.
5496 2018-09-14 02:46:13 I mean, I'd lock a dude in the stocks too if he asked for a 'malty and full bodied' mead.
5497 2018-09-14 02:45:53 Crypto must go... shouldn't even be discussed on there! And don't forget about the Canadian pot stocks!
5498 2018-09-14 02:45:39 Gains in tech shares pushed U.S. stocks higher for a fourth day, and the dollar fell after a gauge of underlying U.S. inflation proved unexpectedly cool in August. The CPI index rose 2.2% from last year, this was compared to 2.4% expected widely #MarketsToday
5499 2018-09-14 02:45:16 Cube ent. Is really playing this shit now? They only did this cuz they know their stocks & profits would massively drop. Plus, EDawn and HyunA are humans not toys so stop fucking playing.

5506 2018-09-14 02:42:46 Also they can’t just kick them out like that. Have they even THOUGHT about the consequences??? Like bro HyunA has been a main reason Cube exists and wtf r they gonna do about Pentagon? Cube acts so impulsively they obviously didn’t consider their stocks and company’s reputation

5511 2018-09-14 02:40:05 Did Cube seriously just bring them back cuz they saw how their stocks were dropping like crazy? HyunA and E’Dawn should just leave the Cube since they obviously don’t give a shit on their artists and why do people suddenly hate the artists once they date? they’re happy jeez
5512 2018-09-14 02:39:13 Their stocks is still going down
5513 2018-09-14 02:38:44 cube saw their stocks going down and then confirmed that hyo and hyuna arent leaving cube im screaming

5521 2018-09-14 02:35:24 Some cannabis stocks are over valued. The government is trying to mess the with the Canadians. Tmrw is gonna be crazy in the sector. #cannabisstocks
5522 2018-09-14 02:34:10 @cubeunited ’s thought 

bad fans: I don’t like them dating! No! I’m not their fan anymore! 

Cube: Okay they don’t want them dating. Remove Hyuna and E’Dawn immediately! 

(CUBE’s stocks going down) 

Cube: No! Wait! What is happening! 

Too late... 
5523 2018-09-14 02:34:06 hhhh apparently sabi ni Cube na hindi sila tatangalin si edawn at si hyuna kasi maysadong sila affected dahil sa mga loss ng stocks pero cancelled parin sila
5524 2018-09-14 02:33:52 yes bumaba daw ang stocks agad agad hahaha pero ang cute ng icon mo hahaha

5526 2018-09-14 02:32:43 Cube entertainment has kicked out two of their artists (e’dawn and HyunA) for dating. But they took back what they said for now because their stocks instantly plummeted when they announced it.

5529 2018-09-14 02:31:10 Before or after Anti-Trusts suits?

1A violation? (class actions)

Election rigging?
Promoting violence/dischord?
Stock jumping off the cliff?

Stocks bought for pennys birthing the replacement media from the bones of the corrupt.

5530 2018-09-14 02:31:01 Yeah, people who promote individual stocks think they're the next Warren Buffett , but most wind up under-performing the indices (or even under-performing T-Bills)
5531 2018-09-14 02:30:43 Sorry during 2000 all stocks dropped almost half
And who didn’t get a tax cut.
5532 2018-09-14 02:30:01 Stocks are interesting because you get too see what companies are running the world.
5533 2018-09-14 02:27:24 CUBES STOCKS DECREASED FASTER THAN MY DYING MENTAL HEALTH
5534 2018-09-14 02:26:37 & it's fuck Americans, not Kap.. Yall were supposed to bitch & complain so I could cash in on Nike stocks dropping..
5535 2018-09-14 02:26:36 Agreed. Unfortunately for long term holders of these stocks, they aren’t Amazon and don’t have the future potential of $BTC & crypto imo. The stocks will come back down at some point.
5536 2018-09-14 02:26:24 I am so sorry, I just saw this. Cube is a bitch. This is literally a case of history repeating itself. They did this with Beast. With 4minutes. Now they tried doing this again. But with the stocks falling, they have changed their minds temporarily. I hope hyuna and e'dawn leaves
5537 2018-09-14 02:25:59 Go Eargo!  @eargo https://markets.businessinsideracom/news/stocks/eargo-named-an-honoree-in-fast-company-s-2018-annual-innovation-by-design-awards-1027532805
5538 2018-09-14 02:25:31 Right. No one said anything about the massive arsenal of semi-automatic and - with the help of bump stocks - fully automatic weapons. Everyone was really quiet about that (and every time there’s a school shooting too)
5539 2018-09-14 02:25:19 It’s not a matter of can’t but of won’t. Same in this case, Cube didn’t have to go down that route, they chose to....stupidest decision ever & now that stocks have plummeted they come out saying: it’s not final...sure, Hyuna and E’Dawn are better off out of the joke of an agency
5540 2018-09-14 02:25:05 How are American steel stocks doing?
5541 2018-09-14 02:24:55 mel ? being soft ? with me ? in this economy ? omg, tHE STOCKS ARE UP, THE NATIONAL DEBT PAID

5543 2018-09-14 02:24:12 CDNA, IGC, BPTH. SHAK, SCG, SNAP (selling), GRPN, CHK, ZNGA, FIT, MSFT, SIRI and some bitcoin stocks too.
5544 2018-09-14 02:24:07 #NiSource Inc stock dropping like a rock amid strong time for energy stocks. Blowing up 3 whole neighborhoods will do that to you
5545 2018-09-14 02:23:41 Jaja. Fijate que me pasaste solo sobre utilidades comerciales. 
No es la presion fiscal total. Dinamarca te asesina sobre stocks (personas). Es lo que deciamos antes. Irlanda es igual. En gral funciona.
5546 2018-09-14 02:22:38 Idgaf what ppl saying.. in the 90s-00s rappers put trump on a pedestal. Like 50 said “we can do TRUMP talk, real estate stocks and bonds/ or gangsta shit with Rugers and glocks in palms”
5547 2018-09-14 02:22:12 He runs one of the most successful banks in the world. You on the other hand can hardly not lose money in you're "family office". You really pissed away daddy's inheritance. If you just invested in stocks and not touched it with your filthy little hands, it would have been more.
5548 2018-09-14 02:21:38 Let's not put this on CEO's entirely.
The 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10%.
 $840b of last year's $1T stock dividends went to the richest at lower capital gains rates.

The HMO Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-222, 42 U.S.C. §300e) is also a culprit.
5549 2018-09-14 02:21:34 Throw those in the bin with the weed stocks soon
5550 2018-09-14 02:21:33 Your stocks went up right, you don't have a  mandatory Obama care payout right? If you work, you probably rcvd a raise right? What else can I prove? 
P.S. Never call anyone/anything stupid, until you look in the Mirror.
5551 2018-09-14 02:20:00 @RockstarGames @RockstarSupport why aren’t we able to use stocks on online this is supposed to be a realistic online game. And i would invest if i could in online not just story mode.
5552 2018-09-14 02:18:55 Just saw a tweet that claimed the US is saying theyll deny entry to folks who even invest in marijuana stocks in Canada. I guess I'm actually happy I missed that boat
5553 2018-09-14 02:18:39 hello! i think you're misunderstanding something. we still DO NOT HAVE any stocks for it since well it's oos. it's an interest check 
5554 2018-09-14 02:18:17 MAGA people don’t own stocks.

5558 2018-09-14 02:15:05 My stocks was doing numbers today
5559 2018-09-14 02:14:20 U.S. Market Check

    Gains in the information technology and health care sectors helped to propel U.S. stocks higher for a fourth day.
    The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.97 percent.
5560 2018-09-14 02:14:10 In my opinion your  probably better off paying a professional to do it for you. Stocks are too risk if you don’t know exactly what your doing.
5561 2018-09-14 02:13:14 Healthcare stocks also turned in a strong performance as AbbVie rose 3.3%, Abbot Laboratories jumped 2.3%, Celgene gained 2.2%, Amgen climbed 1.7%, and Merck and Baxter added 1.4%.
5562 2018-09-14 02:12:35 Technology stocks were best performers as Apple climbed 2.4% after it unveiled new iPhones; Micron leapt 4.5% after hedge fund manager revealed it was "very, very long" the stock, and Qualcomm jumped 4.0% after launching a US$16billion accelerated stock buyback program
5563 2018-09-14 02:12:32 the truth is the truth if you need constant positivity in life you shouldn't be trading stocks. there is only 1 reality and that is the tape, everything else is noise.
5564 2018-09-14 02:12:28 What? May stocks talaga? Kaya pala feeling entitled. Yes please. Dapat dun na suju sa independent label para may creative freedom na sila. Like Sechskies finally may say sila sa brand and Shinhwa
5565 2018-09-14 02:12:13 Comments from NIO buyers:

"13.50 and going to 350 within 5 years."
"Hope I can ride that pump and jump before the dump."
"50 @ 6.27 and wishing I had put every penny...into this. I have Ameritrade ... I only use them to have access to pink sheet weed [stocks] now. "

YIKES!
5566 2018-09-14 02:11:20 I don’t smoke marijuana, I can’t afford to invest in any stocks, and I already have to work two jobs, so I’m good. As long as we’re barring people for legal activity, can we bar anyone who voted for Trump from infecting... I mean “entering” Canada?
5567 2018-09-14 02:10:38 my boy done taught me bout stocks .... YESSSIIRRRRR  I still got a lot to learn thou  
5568 2018-09-14 02:09:53 Muchos paises con alta presion fiscal bajaron la tasa de impuestos a la produccion y la subieron a los stocks personales. En ppio funciono. Habria que ver el caso x caso. No lo tengo hecho.
5569 2018-09-14 02:09:53 nakatali SM that time kasi these elfs have stocks :/ pero may hope kami kasi may separate label na for suju, yung Label SJ. mas may hold na sila sa decisions ganyan. 

exactly! sayang na sayang talaga ang 2ne1 :(
5570 2018-09-14 02:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.

5572 2018-09-14 02:09:04 US stocks rose on Thursday, with the S&P 500 rising for a fourth straight session, led by technology shares as Apple recovered from losses in the previous session.
5573 2018-09-14 02:08:56 @cubeunited how ya stocks looking?
5574 2018-09-14 02:08:26 U.S. stocks closed mostly higher Thursday,09/13/18: $DJIA +0.57% at 26,145.99, $SPX +0.53% at 2,904.18, $COMPQ +0.75% at 8,013.71, $RUT -0.08% at $1714.32.
5575 2018-09-14 02:08:06 Apparently “Canadian marijuana investors could face a lifetime bans from entering US” - Market Watch. The news was slow to come out but it send all pot stocks in free fall except Tilray
5576 2018-09-14 02:07:26 Asian stocks extended a rally after their recent battering drove  valuations to a two-year low, following a technology-supported advance  in U.S. equities. The dollar held declines after U.S. inflation  unexpectedly cooled in August.
5577 2018-09-14 02:07:26 Keep boycotting Nike, friends 

Because my Nike stocks are 

Jokes on you, fools.

5579 2018-09-14 02:06:29 Today I learned if youre employed by the gov, you can’t invest in weed stocks
5580 2018-09-14 02:06:05 Oh, I want to invest more aggressively in stocks- I would love to pay my looming school debts off quicker so then I can have the possibility of getting Alfred to life in fursuit! Maybe invest in the Canada cannabis company, @tilray ? (Crazy rise in stock price! )
5581 2018-09-14 02:05:42 He is running the country just like he runs his pathetic businesses.  Debt debt  debt...
Bankruptcy.  A legacy for the grandkids. Embarrassing what future young adults will think of this disaster. Lawyers r doing very well. Buying stocks.
5582 2018-09-14 02:05:16 Seriously what these guys are doing is amazing. Massive respect for @neiltyson “he’s the only game in town...the best we’ve had since Edison” and defending @elonmusk on his Right to make his own choices.

#Tesla #Choice #Liberty #Stocks #Engineering
5583 2018-09-14 02:05:16 Important things to consider:

1. When do the stocks "pay out"?
2. How do they "pay out"? X x Wins? Bonuses? That could help determine initial pricing.
3. How does trading stocks work, when do prices settle? (Bc buyers and sellers need to match and determine the new price.)
5584 2018-09-14 02:04:58 I like the truth behind it. And only reason stocks are up is because of tax cut for rich
5585 2018-09-14 02:03:35 They already are. Their stocks have plummeted. Hyuna was one of their biggest idols. Also E’Dawn apparently wrote Shine which is there biggest song. Pentagon won’t be the same without E’Dawn. I’ll still support them but kicking them out was stupid af.
5586 2018-09-14 02:01:49 pababa na stocks ng cube patungo sa inner core HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
5587 2018-09-14 02:01:47 Wasn't there recent reports of huge stocks of water hidden by #Corrupt local officials in #PuertoRico
5588 2018-09-14 02:01:29 la na pababa na stocks nila patungo sa inner core
5589 2018-09-14 02:01:01 On the real.. i dont care what Trump does or says but he needs to keep doing it because my stocks have been killing it these last two years..
5590 2018-09-14 02:00:54 Final Decision on $NIO -don't fall in love with it unless your a long-period - take your gains and move on-as a #dayrader #swingtrader - your into shorts, not the future - #IPO's have no history - Minimize your risk with #DD insight - omit greed - #stocks #daytrades #buildwealth
5591 2018-09-14 01:59:49 Not sure I completely agree with you. You could hold stocks not reliant on China. China is also looking to other countries to fill the void due to trade war so that is good for us. Also resources are priced in US dollars which with a weak AUD is going to benefit our miners.
5592 2018-09-14 01:59:23 If you want to talk penny stocks, I recommend AMFE.
5593 2018-09-14 01:59:04 THATS THE FUCKING TEA AND TBH ITS CUBES LOSS THEY WERE CARRYING THAT COMPANY AND NOW THERE STOCKS ARE PLUMMETING. BOTH OF THEM ARE SO TALENTED THEYLL TOTALLY GET SIGNED SOMEWHERE ELSE OR START THEIR OWN LABEL OR SMTH. BUT I DO FEEL BAD FOR THEM THEY DONT DESERVE THIS BULLSHIT.
5594 2018-09-14 01:58:56 Made $30 from stocks today feelgoodman. Sucks I could of made 1000+ easily tho lmao
5595 2018-09-14 01:58:35 You know what, you're probably right on that, but I invest into my 401K every month 10% with people who specialize in stocks. My investments focus on American businesses. If u say we're all winning then w/ that logic I should be winning... or the argument should change.
5596 2018-09-14 01:57:29 oo lol after an hour or smth kay nibaba og pinaabrupt ang stocks sa cube hahahahaha so nagreleased og statement ang ceo na magmeeting pa daw sila about sa final decision hahaha they played themselves
5597 2018-09-14 01:57:20 You guys look at this as if he killed someone, he had the inside scoop on what stocks would bust... that’s all nobody was hurt lol
5598 2018-09-14 01:56:30 Long $MTCH 56.50 at the open, long term play. Stp 55.80, made a decent move on the daily. #Gift #Stocks #Fund
5599 2018-09-14 01:55:47 Republicans - You've put thousands of doctors out of work, and made chemotherapy pharma stocks crash! Un-American!
5600 2018-09-14 01:55:21 I mean Elon Musk got pretty criticized for doing so. Specially by the media. Not to mention his stocks fell immediately. I do agree with you that it’s dumb to report that there was marijuana in his apartment though
5601 2018-09-14 01:55:11 4 of 5 : Also, I can refinance multiple times to take out equity and buy more properties, so real estate investment if done properly gives many more returns than stock market. But wall street and reporter keep touting that stocks are better than real estate investments without
5602 2018-09-14 01:54:12 They did and then retracted their statement because their stocks went down
5603 2018-09-14 01:52:21 probably cube panicked when they saw their stocks going down
5604 2018-09-14 01:51:42 Wow... even investors and people holding stocks?
Adios #USA. Can't say I'll miss you, so many places to go.
5605 2018-09-14 01:51:24 Yep lmao the stocks dropped so fast that apparently they tried to take it back
5606 2018-09-14 01:49:33 HSBC on IT 
Bookings data from cos are tough to read, but remain the most important driver of stocks in near term
Stay positive on the sector

@Reematendulkar @CNBCTV18News
5607 2018-09-14 01:48:57 Their stocks have dropped lmao
5608 2018-09-14 01:48:35 hyuna and edawn are probably laughing, seeing cube’s stocks dropping
5609 2018-09-14 01:48:13 I need to get involved with buying stocks an what not. But kno little to none about it tbh.
5610 2018-09-14 01:47:54 I gotta study that shit more before i put my money in but i been fucking wit stocks tho just need to learn more about it
5611 2018-09-14 01:47:13 I love my KPOPPIES with sense of humor:

5613 2018-09-14 01:45:59 ya, thats fine. i'm bit higher on him but my point isn't about liking paunovic as a prospect overall. Only that his defensive awareness is not a weakness (and in fact is a strength) and that his stocks numbers were misleading in u18 this year.
5614 2018-09-14 01:44:11 Wow 1v1 m8 3 stocks final destination banana guns only
5615 2018-09-14 01:44:03 100% in US stocks. Except for three years of spending in cash or short-term CDs. Only to be deployed if and when the market Falls by 20%. 4% withdrawal rate at age 65 increased by 3% a year. Works every time.
5616 2018-09-14 01:43:49 Almost all stocks are closing at all time highs...it’s called a bull market.

You can thank President Trump for that.
5617 2018-09-14 01:40:41 Lewd stocks are on the rise.

BUY BUY BUY
5618 2018-09-14 01:40:13 okay i don't even listen to them that much but i saw that cube kicked out hyuna and e'dawn for dating each other and breaching the company's trust... and then took it back when stocks took a hit. like fuck off when was it a crime for two people to date
5619 2018-09-14 01:40:08 might have to by some Michelin, Goodyear and Firestone stocks and retire.
5620 2018-09-14 01:39:37 You know what is also a record? @Nike stocks hit a 53 year high and @realBobWoodward ‘s book broke a 83 year record in publishing sales.
5621 2018-09-14 01:39:32 @Nike must have cut a deal with @realDonaldTrump who must have purchased a huge chunk of @Nike shares along with his rich friends.
It's Trump, follow the money someone told me. So has his voters who are rich compared to others on instructions from their shares/stocks consultancy.
5622 2018-09-14 01:39:00 Don’t let this slide down like Cubes stocks
5623 2018-09-14 01:38:09 You dont manage your investments your stock list is IDENTICAL to Bigbird. I am being an asshole for your own good. You got fleeced on SX and you will get fleeced on others. WISE UP. These people make money from sheep following their stocks. I wish you luck. Read a book.
5624 2018-09-14 01:37:58 disappointed but not surprised they keep ruining their artists career lmao they should be the one protecting them not destroying them lol good luck to their stocks
5625 2018-09-14 01:37:55 Lol what will I buy?...penny stocks?
5626 2018-09-14 01:37:45 It’s really not though. Even large cap stocks like Nike will daily fluctuate a percentage point or two fairly consistently.
5627 2018-09-14 01:37:01 Strongly disagree with the congress members not being able to buy or sell stocks. But some of your stuff is pretty good. I just don’t see how taking rights away from people is setting the right example. But I’m a fan of yours overall
5628 2018-09-14 01:36:24 good morning to hyuna and hyojong ONLY . fuck cube, i hope their stocks plummet even more
5629 2018-09-14 01:34:23 The S&P index rearrangement? Some of it may be related to that. But if tech stock demand in general was robust it might not make much difference. People already have had decent reasons to sell some of the stocks -- like $FB and $NFLX after their July warnings on growth.
5630 2018-09-14 01:33:32 My new hobby is researching stocks...who would have thought...I wake up at 7 even when I don’t don’t have classes so I can go to the Bloomberg terminal...
5631 2018-09-14 01:33:25 Penny stocks...
5632 2018-09-14 01:33:09 They got stocks. Or more going than buying spoons and rare cups.
5633 2018-09-14 01:32:54 $LDSI always check past history of the scam stocks especially when

5640 2018-09-14 01:30:02 My gym stocks the locker room with better personal care products than I provide for myself. Does that mean I'm not quite an adult? Or I'm paying too much for my gym? Or....yes?
5641 2018-09-14 01:30:00 It’s hard to understand how the economy is changing unless you understand the Fusion Super Bull Market. The stocks in the Super Bull are doing much better than the SP 500. They are creating the post 08’ era that can’t be valued with traditional valuation and current accounting..
5642 2018-09-14 01:29:57 It is extremely empirically wrong because a monetary system can be easily designed to be equity based not debt based. People/firms [private sector entities] can easily save in stocks, real estate, or any equity asset or capital object without debt entering into the picture.

5676 2018-09-14 01:08:50 It's almost like they're pumping up their stocks with as few regulations on their money as possible, only to sell it all within the next year.
5677 2018-09-14 01:08:29 @cubeunited YOUR STOCKS ARENT DROPPING BECAUSE HYUNA AND EDAWN ARE DATING. THEYRE DROPPING BECAUSE YOU STOPPED THEIR PROMOTIONS. STOP BEING A SHITTY COMPANY AND FIX THIS.

5692 2018-09-14 01:03:46 @LeahWald Leah, I'm a big fan of your YouTube shows with Tone and Tyler. There is a lot of excitement and movement in Cannabis stocks. I, as well as many others, would appreciate it if you and the guys would do TA on the big caps. TLRY, APH, ACB, WEED, OGRMF.
Thank you,
Taso
5693 2018-09-14 01:02:25 No amount of positive tweets/posts have been able to hold some of these stocks up. When it changes though there will be money to be made again. Just not sure what the trigger will be?
5694 2018-09-14 01:02:21 cube somewhat retracting their /official/ statement by saying they're negotiationg hyuna and edawn's dismissal is capitalism at work, since their stocks plummeted last night lol

5696 2018-09-14 01:01:29 $TLRY is the new bellwether for pot stocks. Ignore $WEED price action from now on.
5697 2018-09-14 01:00:04 You’re welcome.  I thought your presentation was direct, and I especially appreciated the fact that you noted the technology stocks will get hit during the next bear market.  It’s just the nature of the beast.  BTW, I wasn’t “all there” b/c I had a kidney stone removed today
5698 2018-09-14 00:59:19 Renewed optimism in the China trade talks has led to a rise in US stocks. Inflation missed target forecasts- the #USD fell and yields were a touch higher. Chinese officials were receptive of an invite from the US to further talks, however @realDonaldTrump suggests elsewise.
5699 2018-09-14 00:59:09 I just heard EXO’s shooting a MV and that SM’s stocks rose just after they announced EXO’s MV being filmed (WOAH)
Everyone -along with me- is waiting for this comeback. I’m ready for it
~Also PS I hope it’s OT9 cause since I became a fan I haven’t experienced a OT9 comeback~
5700 2018-09-14 00:57:45 Actually all those things R pretty much true. I did have my own Rock band. One of my best friends was the lead singer for a group called Metal Church. You can find them on youtube. I do trade stocks but I am not a day trader, I am retired.  I have a substantial pension and 401k
5701 2018-09-14 00:56:42 woke: save money by investing in stocks
Fake woke: dont save money with the company I invest in via stocks that's worth a trillion cuz you think they should pay taxes.
5702 2018-09-14 00:54:08 Wtf I didn’t know KELF have SM stocks
5703 2018-09-14 00:54:06 got in today around 10am at8.87 thinking to get more on a dip.. that dip never happened  all china stocks cery strong so it ipo’d in a good day.  hang on tight, enjoy the ride
5704 2018-09-14 00:53:32 I will still sell puts on my dividend stocks when they dip, but not super enthusiastic about the call side - they've felt too cheap based on their realized volatility lately. Since they're long term positions, I wouldn't want them called away anyway.
5705 2018-09-14 00:51:41 Hahahaha! Why would you love that? You cashing in some stocks?  #congrats #spendspendspend
5706 2018-09-14 00:51:24 15% is alot in stocks
5707 2018-09-14 00:50:30 Dear #donnydumbdumb aka @realDonaldTrump did you see Nike stocks are at an all time high? Haha
5708 2018-09-14 00:49:52 I feel so bad for hyuna and edawn. 

why cube?

your stocks drop faster than jin's slut drops and you get scared so you put them back in?

board members need to rethink things before putting them into action
5709 2018-09-14 00:48:32 How do u select such cheap price stocks. Please share ur secret.
5710 2018-09-14 00:48:14 Nike stocks are the highest they’ve been all year. 

They know what they’re doing.

I bet you feel like an idiot for burning your shoes huh 
5711 2018-09-14 00:48:08 Avenatti 2020 stocks just went through the roof and I am so tired.
5712 2018-09-14 00:47:05 Yeah, been noticeably quite the last few months

Perhaps a few of the hodler/ramp squad stocks being down 50%+ from highs since early in the year has something to do with it

5718 2018-09-14 00:43:37 Meanwhile, we US citizens are able to invest and own pot stocks. 
5719 2018-09-14 00:42:51 It's a chain on Twitter, man. You new here? You know you've been @ ing the NRA this entire time? Were you engaging in discourse re: Nike's stocks with the guy who runs the NRA's Twitter? Or should he get on  here and tell you to tell somebody who cares?
5720 2018-09-14 00:41:38 CLC’s debut song was really one of the first kpop songs I listened to that got me hooked on kpop twt and the fact that cube ignores them and will do it even more now that their stocks are in the trash, I really believe they’ll disband them soon I’m crying
5721 2018-09-14 00:40:54 Where do you go to purchase cannabis stocks??
5722 2018-09-14 00:39:58 2/2 Chinese stocks were my focus. BABA and IQ were all I traded. I planned intensive pre-market, reactive quickly, even when Trump tweeted, and had my best day yet. Mindset is as important as preparation, and can affect your results immensely
5723 2018-09-14 00:39:29 @TheBubbleBubble housing-related stocks saw a parabolic run-up in 2016-17, but in January the index peaked and now it’s coming down hard. That suggests bad news on the housing market looking 12 months down the road.
5724 2018-09-14 00:38:48 I’ve always been a “plan ahead” kind of man. I’m Already planning my 2020. 

2019- Taxes, second car, move from my apartment, rent house, get passport, restore credit. 
2020- Taxes, start traveling the countries, invest in stocks, go for owning 1st home.
5725 2018-09-14 00:38:45 1/2 Today I had an ethereal experience as a new trader. While walking through midtown Manhattan to my office, I thought to myself: let’s focus on one set of stocks today. Let’s dial the F in, and see if we can get in the flow.

5727 2018-09-14 00:37:58 Could be because his promises were over the top. The tax cuts don't help the average American. Stocks yes but the market works in circles anyway. Figure a recession late this year of next year. If the cuts would have been gradually implemented it would have been better.......
5728 2018-09-14 00:37:24 Dear Apple Company, paki babaan naman po yung presyo ng product nyo para po makapag avail kami ng lahat ng latest product at maubos agad ang stocks nyo diba. Mas kikita po kayo pag ganon. For example, 2017 nilabas ang iPhone X worth 60K dapat ngayong 2018, 20k nalang.

5731 2018-09-14 00:37:12 The fake news continues to push their narrative; it's a few racist nutjobs that find this decision insulting. But at least this article is somewhat accurate.Sales over all is still declining and the stocks will show soon enough.The liberal media will be on the wrong side...again!
5732 2018-09-14 00:35:55 $MOMO up big.  as soon as I get above breakeven I am out.  I only have four Chinese stocks $BABA, $BIDU, $TCEHY, and $BYDDF.  $TCEHY and $BYDDF in very small amounts. Like Munger and Li Lu,  I believe in China.  I just don't know about Trump.
5733 2018-09-14 00:35:44 Usually any stocks failed ER will be down in 2 or 3 days . So  $KR will be lower next week too. Back and forward. Between$26 to $29. My guess.
5734 2018-09-14 00:35:43 How do we sign up? Thanks!
5735 2018-09-14 00:35:16 Thye probably did this cuz 1 stocks and 2nd from all the backlash
5736 2018-09-14 00:34:51 Sorry, but the response with the Michelle Obama photo was meant  as a middle finger to Trump taken from a perceived ethical high ground, not as a starter to a discussion about the direction of Nike's stocks. You're mistaken.
5737 2018-09-14 00:34:32 Stocks will rise by Monday
5738 2018-09-14 00:34:27 Ask the Japanese. During the 1980’s Japanese investors borrowed against real estate, put the money in their stock market which drove up that market, borrowed against their higher stocks to buy real estate & so on until 38,900 & all correlations went to 1 on the way down too.
5739 2018-09-14 00:33:08 Nope, not always.  But they usually do with China stocks.  We know 7 million shares have already been filed to sell by Baidu. So I anticipate a sell off of about 10-20 million shares on Sep. 25th in full.

5744 2018-09-14 00:28:15 Tax cuts... for the wealthy. Stocks... owned by wealthy. Low unemployment... for business owners since people are working 2-3 jobs at minimum wage, foreign policy... for wealthy war profiteers.

5749 2018-09-14 00:26:16 Do you know that it's against the Korean Labour Law to dismiss their employees without informing them? Which is...worst? And it's a terrible decision move, look at their stocks dropping. Nothing to with opinions, im telling you facts.
5750 2018-09-14 00:25:59 Another strategy I deploy when tradung is to find the hottest group and only focus on that group. Right now pot stocks. I am only looking at those and about 5 other stocks. Remaining stock universe does not matter.

5752 2018-09-14 00:23:50 I finally broke down and donated to Wikipedia. It felt like waiting fifteen years to pay a prostitute, but one that tells me about the Ottoman Interregnum and what Mark-Paul Gosselaar is up to these days instead of laughing when I remove the stocks stuffed into my pants

5773 2018-09-14 00:14:02 Where will the investor find the buy candidates?

Try IBD's screens: the IBD 50, NYSE and Nasdaq Stocks On The Move, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders, Stock Spotlight, Global Leaders, Big Cap 20 and the New High List. - IBD Big Picture
5774 2018-09-14 00:13:45 Swing Trade Idea (3-6 month outlook): Money rotates into telecom stocks which become growth stocks again as phones become even more of an extension to being human.

Plus 5G network build up.

$IYZ, $S, $T, $VZ, $FTR...lots more bullish charts out there IMO
5775 2018-09-14 00:13:42 apple stocks rise by 10%.
5776 2018-09-14 00:13:34 Define "tied up in stocks"...do you mean, isn't cash on hand.

So you're arguing he's basically throwing pocket change.  Got it.
5777 2018-09-14 00:13:05 When are we going to get some meth stocks?
5778 2018-09-14 00:12:58 Evidently not built like they use to be. The 850 we have now gives us a few days down every couple years for one thing or another.  No one stocks parts for em.
5779 2018-09-14 00:12:21 everybody try to sell his stocks in hope to make money but back fires in terms of stock value
5780 2018-09-14 00:12:00 Equivalence of statistics across the team and the adoption of the central spokesman for recycling and recycling through the valuation of stocks and the adoption of the general market dealing and holding the currency of the team to rise and draw

5785 2018-09-14 00:11:04 Sold my $AMZN today for a nice little 6% gain. These high flying tech stocks I have less conviction on and tend to hold shorter
5786 2018-09-14 00:10:55 Obamacare is the biggest insurance fraud scheme perpetrated on Americans in history! Insurance company profits and stocks went from 30% to 300%, Obama’s buddies profited. So did I, as an insurance analyst. It took 5 minutes to figure out the scheme. High deductibles no payouts?
5787 2018-09-14 00:10:34 Deservedly so because it’s just another hidden tax and no real intent to understand the impact on smaller retailers. All their current stocks are rendered unsellable because almost no PMDs have that particular certification.
5788 2018-09-14 00:10:10 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
5789 2018-09-14 00:08:41 And also another reason why not to invest in the big companies is because 1. Very expensive, 2. You don't get a lot of shares, not much money is coming towards you, 3. the higher the company the more you have to put in the work to get stocks which can take a lot of time.
5790 2018-09-14 00:08:07 I’m not sure how Cube makes decisions. Did they really think their stocks would skyrocket after deciding to let both of the artist go? Even a 5th grader would think that’s a suicide mission.  

It’s even worse that the company  tryna play it off. 

I’m happy BEAST left tbh.
5791 2018-09-14 00:07:13 You can use it to buy pot stocks online
5792 2018-09-14 00:06:15 These are sick, illiterate & ignorant people that has no real direction in life. I believe that Mattel with its corporate prime holdings should issue a seize and desist or execute a lawsuit for damaging its brand & it's image, or else their stocks & products will sink with them
5793 2018-09-14 00:05:47 I now wanna know if the Party City nearby stocks them.
5794 2018-09-14 00:04:32 Talking about stocks make me want to buy some.  YG stocks !
5795 2018-09-14 00:04:20 When you kneeled down with a humbled heart, your stocks will go up!
5796 2018-09-14 00:04:15 Weed stocks are the new Bitcoin. They might pump them more into Oct after the initial pullback but after the legalization they will dum them and hang retail to dry just like they did with Bitcoin. It never fails $CGC $TLRY $CRON $MJ
5797 2018-09-14 00:04:07 Don't be sorry, I'm not adversarial about stocks.  I don't care what you buy or sell.  All good! I just went on their website and gathered those facts about the company. You told me to know facts before I judge valuations.
5798 2018-09-14 00:03:31 Debicki is brilliant, I was glad she was chosen to replace Eva. But I'm suffering here because I'm watching the movie being praised, and you know, her last two films were two of the biggest laughing stocks in the world in 2018
5799 2018-09-14 00:03:04 If I do it well I’ll make a kit and post a tutorial. I’m thinking about starting a blog about fitness and stocks and calling it “weights and interest rates” lol I might have to add a techy twist
5800 2018-09-14 00:02:55 A simple Trend Following Strategy for Growth stocks

5801 2018-09-14 00:02:49 If I were Hyuna and E.Dawn,I would not go back to Cube Ent. at all after their sales/stocks drop down. They made a horrible decision,they have to suffer the consequences.
5802 2018-09-14 00:02:34 I'm with you, Courtney. Some excuses my Trump-loving friends have given: "My stocks are up." "Taxes are down." "I'm swimming in money." "But her emails."
5803 2018-09-14 00:02:01 cube sees their stocks drop so they take back the statement..imma just sip this HOT tea

5805 2018-09-14 00:01:43 Yo what are you supposed to do if an Isabelle 2 stocks you in bracket?
5806 2018-09-14 00:01:38 Yes thats kind of why I am holding waiting for the Sept 30th data. Hoping for a run up before that. Thanks for getting back to me nice to have another viewpoint...
5807 2018-09-14 00:00:52 After they found out cubes stocks dropped drastically and now they said the haven’t kicked them out it’s still in decision
5808 2018-09-14 00:00:10 Yeh, simply saying that they are unintentionally market timing as a result of not being able to find stocks they like.
