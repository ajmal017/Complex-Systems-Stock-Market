11 2018-01-25 23:58:06 I just cooked a pork tenderloin, from the Va. farm. I was told it's from a heritage Hereford and they claim it's the most tasteful of any breed. I believe they are right.

52 2018-01-25 23:54:04 Yah, that's a HUGE problem for me. We've got to end these wars for oil and opium.
53 2018-01-25 23:54:00 Don't forget all the international oil companies bailing out of the oil sands. Some US companies have totally pulled out of Alberta.

61 2018-01-25 23:52:39 Any recommendations where I could get my oil changed in the local two cities? Need it done ASAP.
62 2018-01-25 23:52:34 An $85 oil change turn to $35 looks good to me 
63 2018-01-25 23:52:29 Should I start remembering to wash the sawdust/bar oil/gasoline off of my hands before eating
64 2018-01-25 23:52:10 How will they get there if DeBlabio is on Against Oil CO’s. And Carbon footprints? Maybe Bill can use his Cavalcade of huge SUVs to chauffeur them.
65 2018-01-25 23:51:34 I’m sure EV can’t go 150K miles in between maintenance checks. Battery powered forklifts break down all the time and only have a fraction of that mileage. Only difference is no oil change, no crud buildup in the engine, less maintenance but still have breakdown tho
66 2018-01-25 23:51:31 Coconut oil and beard oil for the beard 
67 2018-01-25 23:51:26 Hi! My skin routine involves using an oil cleanser to remove makeup and a foam cleanser to remove any dirt left behind. Some days I'll use an exfoliate. And then I use a toner and moisturizer! The lips are Dior lip glow in light pink 
68 2018-01-25 23:51:25 I mean, seriously, these conversations mainly revolve around how bad CO2 is. However, if CO2 is not bad then we are in no hurry to replace fossil fuels. We still have loads of them. Sure, coal can be nasty but gas and oil are quite good. I have no issue with them.
69 2018-01-25 23:51:09 22 years old and I just now learned that my dad owns an oil well in Texas...

74 2018-01-25 23:50:15 I bet you I know a couple of facts he didn't mention: that the Brown administration has expanded offshore oil drilling by 17 percent in state waters, approving 238 NEW offshore wells under existing leases. He's already done what Trump would like to do.
75 2018-01-25 23:50:10 Good boy. How about changing oil???

83 2018-01-25 23:48:46 What Went Down de Foals es para mi gusto el álbum más flojo de la banda. La gran mayoría de canciones me encantaron muchísimo y las únicas cosas que no me agradaron fueron la portada del álbum, Snake Oil, odie la colaboración con Keith Monteith ...

85 2018-01-25 23:48:23 I use Mask of Magnamity from Lush to exfoliate, a simple clean & clear face wash and teatree oil is less than $10 on Amazon

94 2018-01-25 23:46:45 GA. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation. It’s also its largest economy and oil producer. President Buhari has been personally at the forefront of Nigeria’s anti-corruption fight for almost 3 years. He’s obviously respected by his peers in the 55 member-country African Union.
95 2018-01-25 23:46:43 @POTUS44 Correct. I saw her again the next morning there at Maitreya, she spent the night out of town with her parents because of the electric emissions. They shut off power while she was there. Used candles and oil lamps. @FBI @CIA @DHSgov @SecretService @USCommandCyber
96 2018-01-25 23:46:43 "This Executive Order will tax all forms of public transportation unless Little Chucky Schumer and the America-hating Democrats fund my Oil Platforms of Freedom proposal that our country desperately needs. No collusion!"-reality if Trump gets his #fuckingwall 4 #DACA hostages
97 2018-01-25 23:46:38 He would also have benefited from the North Sea oil revenue
98 2018-01-25 23:46:32 I was thing at work about the yard work and the  downstairs neighbors dogs, land minds and the oil change and spark plug for my mower. Then I remembered it's January.
99 2018-01-25 23:46:28 Oil spills always are ignored
100 2018-01-25 23:46:22 You’ve been calling for a top in oil for months. And in the markets for longer than that. Eventually it’ll be time to short all of it, but that time is not now.

103 2018-01-25 23:45:56 My car needs an oil change. Can the crew get that for me as well? Lol

Guess you'll get a shot to show em what's it's like to win from the back
104 2018-01-25 23:45:42 Probably oil change
105 2018-01-25 23:45:41 Oh mine too. But it's best to spray it with a little oil so it doesn't just burn. When we did it w/o it wasn't as good.
106 2018-01-25 23:45:36 That's just a standard feature on the thinkorswim platform - not for crypto right now though (that is crude oil /CL)
107 2018-01-25 23:45:31 last thing my dad said before he hung up the phone was that the gas leak alarm was going off which is pretty problematic considering he's on an oil rig
108 2018-01-25 23:45:00 I really should bring you some of my volumising no-oil hair oil.
109 2018-01-25 23:44:59 I don't think he is old enough to remember any of it or he'd know about the oil embargo and many strikes under the Heath government.
110 2018-01-25 23:44:50 I wanna make something similar to baby oil cause that oil too lit 
111 2018-01-25 23:44:34 Large simple figures have become big in recent years as rising oil prices made figures in general more costly & though they're simpler the large size of this type of fig appeals more to Parents and Grandparents who at least feel like they are getting a large toy for their money.
112 2018-01-25 23:44:05 coconut oil sucks. I’ll never put that shit on my body or hair
113 2018-01-25 23:43:56 So Greg, having watched this irrational looking behaviour for many years I think at least two factors are at play. 1/ Second order effects from a large change in oil prices are longer lasting and may affect more distant price levels 2/ TIPS are a relatively illiquid market ...
114 2018-01-25 23:43:47 Not if we can find a plucky crew of oil rig workers
115 2018-01-25 23:43:46 That was a tough one! Previous Lib Dem ward until 2009. Got everyone talking about the oil drilling 
116 2018-01-25 23:43:44 people who use coconut oil when you're cooking. Sos i need help
117 2018-01-25 23:43:40 Black castor oil will help with connecting/growing your beards men 
118 2018-01-25 23:43:36 Ours is no oil at all. Just trying out fries right now to see.
119 2018-01-25 23:43:29 I’ve been waiting for this stupid fucking oil change for almost 2 hours now. I hate the Jiffy Lube on Manchester
120 2018-01-25 23:43:22 And a month after my check engine light came on the car, I finally got the oil changed
121 2018-01-25 23:43:14 "The craziest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
122 2018-01-25 23:43:09 Not in LA, SF or Sacramento. No it's 20 miles from the California/Oregon border in a small town with arguably no connection with oil drilling or State Govt.   WOW!
123 2018-01-25 23:43:05 Rosehip oil can cause some redness or flakiness in skin sometimes but I would choose a lighter oil when putting it on your face. Grapeseed oil is a good place to start, also if you do a facial massage when you put on any moisturizer it gives you a beautiful dewy look!
124 2018-01-25 23:43:03 I got one for xmas. It's the best. Spray food with veggie oil though. Olive oil makes the food taste odd.
125 2018-01-25 23:43:00 I just read an article in Time magazine by the junior Senator from Kentucky praising #45 and his major accomplishments such as coal mining, off shore oil drilling, tax cut, Ben Carson. This kid has a lot to learn. What a bunch of horse shit.
126 2018-01-25 23:42:59 Venezuelans: "We're dying, our government is hogging all the money they make off oil. We don't get the care we need or have the ability to leave the country.

We are literally being murdered like cattle for protesting."

Some shmuck: "YEAH well our president said MEAN things."
127 2018-01-25 23:42:38 EVERYTIME I go get an oil change I always have to help them turn my car on cause it has anti theft 
128 2018-01-25 23:42:36 How pathetic, gone from Statesmen to cheap snake oil peddlers.
129 2018-01-25 23:42:29 It's all fun and game until one of them finds oil off its shores (the only reason they're haggling about it.)
130 2018-01-25 23:42:28 thanks.. husband taking pictures of the box right now... oil..  etc..
131 2018-01-25 23:42:27 now what is  Trump doing to the Native American Indians?  Destroying their land for oil and sending 'em back to Asia, when they were here 14k years before us.  Yes and trump is a white supremacist.. and our president... hmm
132 2018-01-25 23:42:18 The kurds have no plans to pay taxes. Damascus should refrain from wasting lives defending tax avoiders and cheats. Let the US handle them. Syria does not have enough oil to be worthwhile for international companies to invest the needed funds to develop the area.

140 2018-01-25 23:41:07 depends on your price range and skin type but I like Acure Organics’ rosehip oil (on sale at Whole Foods), Farmacy’s honey moisturizer is a godsend & well worth the money, and Lush has some nice facial moisturizers as well. I also use Milk’s cooling water sometimes
141 2018-01-25 23:41:06 I don’t see how people still moisturing their skin with just lotion in 2018. Coconut oil is LIFE
142 2018-01-25 23:41:02 it was an oil massage that i did
143 2018-01-25 23:40:59 Hey @JkissaMakeup have you tried the new makeup remover cleansing oil duo from @PixiBeautyPH? I’m so sad they reformulated the old cleansing oil.
144 2018-01-25 23:40:58 How the fuck this bitch burn oil before she even use it to cook??
145 2018-01-25 23:40:51 The entire solar industry needs to hire some heavy hitter lawyers to take this to Federal court.  Revenge against a former president is not good grounds for this tariff; nor is the fact that Trump plans to make a $Billion on the Rosneft Oil fields deal with Vladimir Putin.

151 2018-01-25 23:39:58 Greg you are quite right - it makes little fundamental sense for distant inflation expectations to follow spot oil so closely.  Forwards have moved much less since some of the move has been driven by weather but you are right, they are correlated.  More on my next tweet
152 2018-01-25 23:39:56 We just got some new *[NUG] Premium Jack OIL*

154 2018-01-25 23:39:34 Two thoughts : freeze to -20, then it’s not a liquid. Buy some iv sets and squeeze all the oil into it and put it in a duty free bag.. Pretend it’s a glow stick for your children.
155 2018-01-25 23:39:23 Use it with vitamin e oil. Your skin will feel like silk in a week g

157 2018-01-25 23:39:12 Doing thirty original oil paintings in thirty days. Keep your eyes peeled and your cash app loaded. Not painting the same painting twice and almost never painting commissions. Price scaled down by age cause I know you kids spend all your money on avacado toast and marijuana.

176 2018-01-25 23:35:53 The EPA is a sham under this administration. We all know this.

183 2018-01-25 23:35:12 ~Did you know~ organic coconut oil has a unique molecular structure that enables it to be absorbed into the body faster and more effectively than most natural oils #organicfiji
184 2018-01-25 23:34:58 Yes! And if you are visiting Bar Zapatones before you head to the match you will walk past a Super Sol market and you can purchase much-needed items like olive oil, rice, beans, tins of tuna, baby food, etc., on your way. Please help!

188 2018-01-25 23:34:39 源氏パイwww
189 2018-01-25 23:34:36 I sometimes add a couple drops of tea tree oil due to its antiseptic properties but just when I’m feeling fancy.
190 2018-01-25 23:34:32 Oil secreted from glands on Gabriel’s wings that helps clean them
191 2018-01-25 23:33:55 あー、なるほろ。
192 2018-01-25 23:33:39 Any naturak foods place like elliots but also probably walmart and i think the vitamin shoppe carries it too. Lavender oil works too but i used clove oil it relieves pain and prevents infection
193 2018-01-25 23:33:32 Mix equal parts of olive oil + dish soap. Add some to the sponge and let it rest for a couple minutes. Then rinse it thoroughly! Works like a charm!
194 2018-01-25 23:33:30 So is the idea to do a kratom oil "bulletproof coffee", or cook with it?  Fascinated either way
195 2018-01-25 23:33:25 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
196 2018-01-25 23:33:25 I'm glad agents Mulder and Scully have finally been vindicated. I bet those missing texts might have more info on the black oil.

200 2018-01-25 23:33:20 randomly worries about national education because I saw someone complaining about having their virgin coconut oil arrived frozen tokopedia and gave one star
201 2018-01-25 23:32:58 Now instead of 6 or 7 years, lets think about the past 40 to 50 years. NO FOREIGN OIL should ever be imported into Canada.
202 2018-01-25 23:32:52 I recently switched to almond oil for the last two weeks and it’s been good so far
203 2018-01-25 23:32:40 I tried putting coconut oil in green tea – this is exactly how I imagine a scented candle would taste.
204 2018-01-25 23:32:39  Just drink lots of water and use coconut oil 
205 2018-01-25 23:32:38 え！？山田がっつって友達いたのー！？
206 2018-01-25 23:32:37 Wait until the summer fuel blend prices kick in.  The sales tax, state excise, federal excise and CAP and Trade credits the oil companies have to pay all add up for CA.

208 2018-01-25 23:32:24 I recently started taking CBD oil. You don't have to worry about getting high. It's THC free. At least the kind I take..
209 2018-01-25 23:32:13 Hmm jadi pengen triple cleansing, otw nyari cleansing oil/milk dah hahahha
210 2018-01-25 23:32:12 Where do I get clove oil?
211 2018-01-25 23:32:11 Somehow I got lavender oil in my eye and then spent ten minutes frantically washing my face and my eye. And now all I smell is lavender. And that shouldn’t be bad except it’s just burning.
212 2018-01-25 23:32:02 俺は発売してみんなでワイワイしながら進めたかっただけにこの仕様変更は結構ヤダなぁ
213 2018-01-25 23:32:02 You know you’re desperate when you take castor oil... 
214 2018-01-25 23:31:56 Sorry you are too late, Joy. The President has sold out the USA to the oil companies and Russians and he was promised a share in the giant Russian oil company.

216 2018-01-25 23:31:38 I just did oil in my car, it needs brakes, tires, alignment, and now a battery.

221 2018-01-25 23:31:12 As a proud Canadian citizen I am remarkably unimpressed with @JustinTrudeau and his Liberal government this past year In 2017 Trudeau accomplished nothing that would economically turn Canada into a competitive oil nation. He instead focused on apologizing to recognized terrorists
222 2018-01-25 23:31:08 Yup, it's gonna need a second flush and is being checked out for warped parts in the engine. We ran it too long without being able to change the oil. Can you saly "sludge"?
223 2018-01-25 23:30:46 Blend 2 tablespoons dates with 4 cups dips. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with a nice chianti.

FUCK.
230 2018-01-25 23:29:47 So is anyone gonna hook me up with a good cold pressed face oil?

Preferably mixed oils (I ain't willing to shell out oil from just one plant)  and good for skin that breaks out easily...
231 2018-01-25 23:29:33 How do you fund us? Our income tax goes to London along with income from oil, whisky and other Scottish products.
232 2018-01-25 23:29:25 That 35 years of English oil and gas billions you must mean. #cuckoo
233 2018-01-25 23:29:18 I think coconut oil is the best moisturizer for dry skin. Tried the rest; coconut oil is the best!
234 2018-01-25 23:29:11 That going on with us to the neon would not start this morning and it has a oil leak also need to change the oil lol
235 2018-01-25 23:29:02 what if it is organic canola oil?
236 2018-01-25 23:28:58 It’s always about money, the oil people making money don’t want to stop. So they either stop renewables at every turn or we just give the renewable energy companies to the oil people, for free so they can keep making money.
237 2018-01-25 23:28:48 そんな降っとるのか…
238 2018-01-25 23:28:39 Maybe drilling for oil is what is meant by "drain the swamp"

241 2018-01-25 23:27:42 Ive gone six months without changing it. Youre also friends with a guy who can do it free, so long as you buy him the oil to di it with...
242 2018-01-25 23:27:09 made my own oil change appt i am proud
243 2018-01-25 23:27:05 nah but you have really tight curls that’s why it still curls. Get the gummy vitamins from nature’s bounty & try using castor oil
244 2018-01-25 23:27:01 When you show up at Davos, see 14 ft of snow, pat yourself on the back for confirming Climate Change is a hoax, triple down on oil and coal, then forfeit thousands of jobs and billions of dollars by not getting out ahead of new energy technologies the rest of the world is buying.
245 2018-01-25 23:26:23 @Isuckatpicking my prediction for tonight.....Oilers are playing a backup goalie....so they will out shoot them 40-20, flames will score on the first shot, and Oil with give up a power play goal......or 3.  Oh and Lomberg is playing his first game, so guaranteed first goal
246 2018-01-25 23:26:12 The governance required? I think you mean invading their countries and stealing their oil?
247 2018-01-25 23:25:49 i tired
248 2018-01-25 23:25:43 What I am concerned about however is how the recent NLBR vs Murphy Oil decision affects workers, esp working class women during a time when many are taking their employers to task for sexual harassment and/or failure to respond to it. How does that affect their legal recourse ?

awful

255 2018-01-25 23:24:45 Isreal coveted Palestine for generations. Trump and Kushner like Murdoch et al is in an awful hurry to get their new snouts into the latest Oil and Gas trough
256 2018-01-25 23:24:24 There is no punishment severe enough for this type of crime. The rapist will never suffer the pain and terror that this child suffered. That being said, I am not opposed to boiling him in oil

258 2018-01-25 23:24:15 True we already have rail to Churchill Man. Pipelines are safer and less carbon footprint! Look at trans mountain! The Irving oil company also owns tankers why would they want pipelines from the west! Buffet owns railroads?

261 2018-01-25 23:23:50 Hi EK - so your thinking is USO goes back to about 13.22 and that will be the high for a good while and we could possibly expect to see 10.46 afterwards in the future before oil resumes upward? We are now at a weekly cycle high in oil and should expect a pullback soon, right?

266 2018-01-25 23:23:20 True, which mean that in the end even fewer will owe anything for taxes, and many will get some kind of refund, so the statement by @TawdryOtter that it goes to big oil, etc isn't particularly accurate

283 2018-01-25 23:20:56 Cut off humanitarian aid to Palestinians if they don't negotiate? Guess the word humanitarian means nothing to us anymore!

299 2018-01-25 23:18:29 @MadMoneyOnCNBC what is your thought on Chesapeake drop it and take the loss or wait for earnings and see what direction they are headed with the rise of oil and Nat gas?
300 2018-01-25 23:18:29 I'll bet in a month we'll going to find that the oil industry was behind this decision.  They want to maintain their control on the power output in this country.
301 2018-01-25 23:18:24 My car is purring like shit with this new oil 
302 2018-01-25 23:18:20 Hanover Honda.  Why the FUCK.  IS MY GOD DAMN OIL CHANGE TAKING OVER AN HOUR.
303 2018-01-25 23:18:19 You know your religious beliefs are a total joke when you begin to equate men who are faithful to men you cheat with porn stars.  Jerry Falwell & his son equate to nothing more than money grubbing snake oil salesmen.  
304 2018-01-25 23:18:01 That sounds yummy! I listen to some music, stretch, oil pull sometimes, look through my planner, and read some news! 
305 2018-01-25 23:17:33 I love Olbas oil. I want all the Olbas oil scented things. I'm addicted. Haven't even got a cold anymore.
306 2018-01-25 23:17:32 Oil change and a hair cut are definitely a must tomorrow 
307 2018-01-25 23:17:28 Indeed... and run him out of town on a rail. He's a snake oil salesman.

309 2018-01-25 23:17:05 My friend has dry sockets as well right now, and she said that if you buy clove oil at the health food store and carefully apply a drop (no more) with a Q-Tip, it helps. I've never had them so I can't confirm, but it could help!

317 2018-01-25 23:15:48 Correct.... 100% Correct. My next door neighbours are both doctors and they told me directly that there are more advantageous packages on offer in the middle East in the oil rich nations.

332 2018-01-25 23:14:20 Maybe your facewash is too drying? And then your skin tries to compensate with more oil?

351 2018-01-25 23:12:20 Q: Why does Fed gov proposal about testing carbon up and down the oil industry line when a certain cement plant in Quebec get to bypass a carbon plan?  You are too quiet on this.  We need @PremierBradWall or @WBrettWilson to defend our interests.

359 2018-01-25 23:11:12 Creating American manufacturing is great, but only IQ45 would enforce a tariff that will nearly kill the industry and cause layoffs BEFORE a single plant can be built here. OPEC has a major influence on oil prices. Oil won't go up because of the tariff. #UnfitLyingDimwit

362 2018-01-25 23:10:56 We are not an oil rich country . The Hard Left has wrecked the economy of Venezuela-an oil rich country. Ireland has a growth rate of 5% per annum. A triumph of centre  policies.  Paul Murphy was one of Syriza's advisers. Syriza took his advice. The Greek economy is in doldrums

365 2018-01-25 23:10:40 I personally think it's easier to persuade someone to cut palm oil out their diet rather than ask them to cut meat out. So I like to focus my energy on promoting about the destructivness of palm oil. There are many fights to be fought with the destruction of our world...

383 2018-01-25 23:07:46 The worst part of climate change is that oil companies are literally paying millions of dollars to influence politicians to be willfully ignorant and spread lies to people and citizens don't realize how wrong their leaders are

Nope I’m his ugly friend. Leave me alone.

456 2018-01-25 22:57:40 Trump is catering his base that still believe coal is a viable fuel source in our climate change damaged world and his deep pocketed pals in the oil industry. Another despicable move by this loathsome faux president.

467 2018-01-25 22:55:54 Oh where to start . As we have been subsidising London for centuries before oil was discovered , our lands were cleared of people for sheep farming , our taxes have been squandered on so many elitist vanity programmes and our boys died in the front lines in every war . Enough ?
468 2018-01-25 22:55:53 He might be right because republicans govern like dictators that want to control everyone of color, women, seniors, kids, teachers, foreigners, Muslims, Jews, Democrats, walls, oil, wildlife, hookers, Puerto Rico, pollution, EPA, IRS, building safety, weather, rape victims, poor,

481 2018-01-25 22:54:26 Oil prices above $70 a barrel. Watch American shale producers ramp up production and down goes the price. So long OPEC. The new swing producers are in North America.
482 2018-01-25 22:54:18 man you know how long products last me? I swear I use water and some baby oil or coconut oil. I am the worst natural cause I do not take care of my shit often enough.

2018 me: I'm tired. I wanna go home, oil cleanse, use a foaming cleanser, exfoliate, tone, apply an essence, use a serum, moisturize, catch up on The Crown, then sleep.
511 2018-01-25 22:50:40 Not so sure about that. All of the GE soys and Canola go to crush for oil. Meal then used for livestock. A lot of GE corn goes into sweetener and starch plants. Huge market..

532 2018-01-25 22:47:49 In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.

546 2018-01-25 22:45:19 I read your posts and get so excited. Then I read news about coal, and oil, and the ridiculous proposals for more windmills in my home state, Maine, and even hearing dubious responses from intelligent friends I'm trying to educate on subject, and I get frustrated.
547 2018-01-25 22:44:51 I may not have a lot of makeup hacks but for my girls who have a lot of oil, use the toilet seat covers, they the same material as blotting sheets
548 2018-01-25 22:44:49 Unsure of Klare thesis that the US was trying to get control of a scarce resource to fuel its own industries. Other things mattered, investment of oil rents and their expenditure on US weapons and infrastructure, recycling of petrodollars in US rather than rivals' interests
549 2018-01-25 22:44:44 Go look up his previous comments on how oil pipelines aren’t really a problem. Their proper maintenance (by iron workers) is what’s needed

559 2018-01-25 22:42:15 Let's just hope they don't unearth any new natural resources, because the moment they do, Syria will get invaded faster than you can say "Iraqi oil"

561 2018-01-25 22:42:10 It's messy as the oil is thin and just pours out if you're not careful.
562 2018-01-25 22:41:59 The $22 dollars I will get for tax reform will pay for gas since the price keeps rising-to bad the oil companies didn't pass theirs on to us

564 2018-01-25 22:41:30 Micro effects macro & vice versa. If we see a rise in oil prices, this will have a significant impact on cost-push inflation
565 2018-01-25 22:40:57 I've got to moisturise my thigh where they took the skin for my skin graft on a daily basis. I wondered if bio oil might be better but the container isn't really smart. The donor site is currently as red as salami & will apparently stay like that for 18 months!

No bueno. Took her three hours.

575 2018-01-25 22:40:02 I used to do it the morning of until someone told me to do it the night before! It helps soak up the oil more and I’ll spray in the morning sometimes just to give it some volume.

594 2018-01-25 22:36:04 Thanks. I've got the Mrs. Dash, I hadn't tried coconut liquid aminos. I am using the oil though, and my personal favourite 'fake' milk, Almond Milk. It's the least offensive, and almost as satisfying.

She disagreed, as most Albertans do -- sense of entitlement etc. But we had a good conversation. Although I will never engage with a journo r pundit on Twitter ever again
741 2018-01-25 22:13:03 I'm at Subaru getting my oil changed and this old white lady keeps staring at me and she just said "interesting" out loud while looking at me....

743 2018-01-25 22:12:57 This is one of a few things I disagree with you on!
It is long past due to start drilling and refining our own oil and gas to make America energy independent! Time to reconsider your stance sir.

744 2018-01-25 22:12:42 Coconut oil is my best friend
745 2018-01-25 22:12:36 For the proven facts that Turkey against crude oil has armed, equipped the Islamic Emirate? Just like all these fake FSAs made up of former ISISs released on condition of fighting the Kurds, you do what?
746 2018-01-25 22:12:34 Need to get a Oil Change ion wanna go nowhere though
747 2018-01-25 22:12:32 Read the article in the financial post 2016 its there black and white! Not only are they supporting third world oil Dictatorships! They create more of a Carbon footprint with tankers, endanger marine Eco systems at countries of origin, Nigeria scary! Eastern consumers pay for it!
748 2018-01-25 22:12:20 Trump's Sonny Perdue, who sued EPA over enviro regs in 2004 to help produce reformulated gasoline for the Oil & Energy industries has absolutely no care to concern himself with the welfare of any living thing.
749 2018-01-25 22:12:12 History is made by the powerful. Well, before 2003 we had oil, but still genocide was committed against the Kurds in the 1980s. Oil is part of the story not all.
750 2018-01-25 22:12:11 I am saying from day 1 he is 'islam' of politics. But nobody is fixing him.
751 2018-01-25 22:11:59 Same - when the one CEO thanked him for making everyone else especially the Oil and Gas industry richer i was disgusted! Fucking monsters!

753 2018-01-25 22:11:47 I really love candles and scented body oil
754 2018-01-25 22:11:32 I bought the moisturizer and still haven't used it but only because my hair already feels like I have oil most of the time why not tho?
755 2018-01-25 22:11:28 its weird to think the earth is gonna run out of oil in my lifetime
756 2018-01-25 22:11:16 @LindaIkeji does your feet smell like hot oil
757 2018-01-25 22:11:12 ...the issue was increasing tanker traffic off BC. She's from Alberta, and has Albertans' typical sharp-elbows approach to debate about oil and energy. "BCers are just a bunch of hippies, and are too stupid to know they need oil."...
758 2018-01-25 22:11:07 That is awesome! CBD oil can also be used topically if your dog ever bites, and makes his skin raw. Will heal it up right fast!
759 2018-01-25 22:10:48 My mom always made a chocolate mayonaise cake. I was repulsed as a kid. Tried it as a teen when I realized its just oil and eggs. However, we were a Hellmann’s household... (I now only buy Duke’s! I was deprived for so many years!)

762 2018-01-25 22:10:31 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
763 2018-01-25 22:10:29 What’s the point? Is it like oil  infused scarves and bonnets? Or shut they lace w eucalyptus?
764 2018-01-25 22:10:23 Tall Oil... I could talk dioxin in P+P mill black drains or aerial spraying of glyphosate and an array of insesticides in sustainable forest management  and impact on local water supply but why bore you. You have made up your mind on risk benefits in Ag so that's ok ....
765 2018-01-25 22:10:14 I like it....... Have to keep that oil flowing.
766 2018-01-25 22:10:14 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
767 2018-01-25 22:09:56 There is an unequal distribution of oil money in Saudi Arabia and that is corruption. Some of the money that is now being handed back to the government is going back to the same system. You can only fight corruption by changing the existing system.
768 2018-01-25 22:09:39 Plus look how fat the dictator is , same as the NK leader Kim , no starving there , Did you know mr Honorable VP Pence that NK has more NBM than potatoes , and as for Venezuela they more oil than The gulf states combined and they are starving !! Staggering !!
769 2018-01-25 22:09:27 It would be much easier to list what isn't on the 'crypto snake oil' list ... so this tweet seems invalid.

775 2018-01-25 22:06:29 @RwandaChannels thanks for following from the land of a thousand hills.          (& akabanga oil )
776 2018-01-25 22:06:24 Baby oil??????!
777 2018-01-25 22:06:10 Dumbest question of the day at the dealership "do you have time for a wash and vacuum?"
Listen, I didn't come here to pay $85 for an oil change and NOT get the free shit.
778 2018-01-25 22:05:42 Yeah an everything 
U basically soak your foot in some salt mineral stuff An it’s start to bubble an foam An depending on the color an substance that comes out they tell u Whatsup then they massage an oil it after
779 2018-01-25 22:05:41 Perf evaporates too quick on me tho, no point unless I go with an oil instead
780 2018-01-25 22:05:17 It's already proven it's viable. People can make up their own minds whether they want to use oil, electricity or something else.  All are viable alternatives.
781 2018-01-25 22:05:09 I just checked my oil and @DobbinsKryssa had no idea how I knew how to do that
782 2018-01-25 22:05:05 I once used coconut oil and it solidified in my hair and I couldn’t get it out. Any tips on how to stop this? X
783 2018-01-25 22:05:04 Its just the 115,000 mile oil life you got going on there lol no big deal
784 2018-01-25 22:04:58 Hmm who needs oil....
785 2018-01-25 22:04:46 They are about to flood the US with investment cash !  All investment bankers are praising his tax cuts.  North slope will easily make US #1 oil exporter.  Hang on!  It's going to be a white-knuckle ride to DOW 40K!  #Optimism
786 2018-01-25 22:04:36 The oil industry funds terrorism. We get it from countries that are complicit with ISIL.
787 2018-01-25 22:04:33 Whisper it, but the resource that makes Scotland obscenely wealthy is water not oil. Climate breakdown only makes this more so
788 2018-01-25 22:04:22 coconut oil is your friend (and it smells great)

795 2018-01-25 22:03:17 How much olive oil did you pour over the top dickhead?
796 2018-01-25 22:03:09 i like bird, especially raptors, which is why i found it interesting to make a headline point out of 7 birds killed by the oil spill when that's just a few hours of the continuous toll of wind farm
797 2018-01-25 22:02:51 witch hazel & coconut oil for my face is the best thing I’ve ever used
798 2018-01-25 22:02:43 “When you look at what I think would help increase our productivity and competitiveness here, certainly part of it ties back to the first question: infrastructure. Certainly, in terms of being able to move oil and gas, the right kind of infrastructure across our state.”
799 2018-01-25 22:02:42 We can still defeat them. Will support solar, whatever the cost. Oil & gas destroys the land, the air and the water.
800 2018-01-25 22:02:34 Came from Man United (A much bigger club than your arab oil fund) where he won 3 Prem titles.
801 2018-01-25 22:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
802 2018-01-25 22:02:20 OIL DIFF: 4.75 -> 4.82
803 2018-01-25 22:02:14 Took my car for a oil change...is that a sign that I have maternal tendencies... am I ready to move out and parent a dog, yes.
804 2018-01-25 22:02:03 That's it! I've taken the plunge and invested in oil paints! It feels like a significant moment. #ArtistOnTwitter
805 2018-01-25 22:01:47 The book was quite interesting, seems they left so many door open, they weren’t prepared for a win or the SNL aftermath 
806 2018-01-25 22:01:10 Keystone Oil Pipeline Still at Reduced Pressure
807 2018-01-25 22:01:05 How am I supposed to put oil in my car if I cant get the stupid knob to turn?!?!?
808 2018-01-25 22:00:58 If he's going to really impose these tariffs, I think the gov't needs to stop subsidizing oil companies and start subsidizing renewables.
809 2018-01-25 22:00:44 Most companies in the US that did hold patents either went out of business or moved to China. China subsidizes solar development much like we subsidize oil. Not stolen so much as lured.
810 2018-01-25 22:00:43 Q: Did you talk to many oil & gas companies & how they think about it? @DanielRaimi : The oil & gas companies willing to talk to me, have probably been open-minded folks who are open about risks. A lot of variation in industry!
811 2018-01-25 22:00:37 get this man his oil back
812 2018-01-25 22:00:34 sad and stupid

823 2018-01-25 21:59:30 Yes Sarah, this is what nature looks like when you don't ruin it from drilling for uranium and oil pipelines.
824 2018-01-25 21:58:56 Haha what ever, it won't matter because you will just make up something for your #maga #dupes to eat up so you dopes can sell more lead tainted snake oil. These dummies will believe anything.
825 2018-01-25 21:58:51 But for $19.99 (before disposal fees and more) we’ll throw in an oil change too!

827 2018-01-25 21:58:40 Just silly.  Where are the environmentalists when it comes to the deforestation and oil driven gold mining? Or the amount of deforestation and env. costs to refine and print paper money?  PoW is much more efficient than any other option.
828 2018-01-25 21:58:18 "a  consortium of car companies, oil companies, road contractors, and even  AAA—realized that increasing car sales depended on getting people out of  the way of the cars" - and they were not shy about it
829 2018-01-25 21:58:07 Being in the seafood industry y'all should be front & center to STOP this administration from drilling for oil off ALL U.S. COASTLINES. Don't allow "THEM" the chance to destroy our WATERS!
830 2018-01-25 21:58:05 You realize the Hawks had to come back down to earth at some point right? And don't underestimate the Oil... this is a perfect tank season.

834 2018-01-25 21:57:01 who cares about middle eastern oil when we can just frack texas and north dakota until they have earthquakes ever 5 minutes
835 2018-01-25 21:56:41 Do I hear you saying that to the oil & gas guys? Despite record profits, they get govt subsidies.
836 2018-01-25 21:56:36 But the USA is still all in for oil companies, right!?
837 2018-01-25 21:56:33 For the 2 gm fish oil - do you have a goal DHA and EPA amount or just any combo as long as it’s 2 gm fish oil?
838 2018-01-25 21:56:23 Most or all patients suffering from epileptic seizures are greatly helped by using CBD oil, usually with a small ratio of THC included.

839 2018-01-25 21:56:11 If after the Kurds did all then heavy lifting in the fight against ISIS and we throw them under the bus for a short term oil deal, what other group will be stupid enough to help us in the future ?

865 2018-01-25 21:51:31 When a new business is starting up, it needs subsidies. We will lose out to the world that's also leaping ahead on these. There are ways he's helping oil, so he could be helping here at least with policies (not subsidies).

As I say I love Elon, love how he opens minds but unfortunately he is, modestly, 50% full of shit. Not asperational, just lying and that brings the snake oil salesmen and ultimately will haunt the industries he's in.
870 2018-01-25 21:50:44 If it betters my health, as it has, that's great! I am doing it for the animals. There are other issues, like quinoa ethics and palm oil, that need to be dealt with. Constantly learn and be the best human you can be. 
871 2018-01-25 21:50:43 hey guys I was just wondering where the FUCK has cbd oil been all my life
872 2018-01-25 21:50:11 I know that pain all too well. I'm guessing you've done Netty pot & real sudafed.

A cup of hot peppermint tea may help a little. I also find a spoon of honey w/ a drop of organic peppermint essential oil helps too-although not long term, but it does give some relief.

Good luck

888 2018-01-25 21:48:33 Someone should throw oil on them.
889 2018-01-25 21:48:30 Let me guess, another person from the old country who has no idea how to actually run onshore & offshore oil & gas assets.
890 2018-01-25 21:48:29 Nah @TigerWoods tiger know about the oil spill
891 2018-01-25 21:48:11 Why did the guy that works at the oil shop just say in my home town there's a strip club called "Deja vu"
892 2018-01-25 21:47:58 Bout to go bathe in castor oil at this point bro
893 2018-01-25 21:47:51 It's a rich man's war for G. O. D. 

Guns, oil, and drugs. They're still guarding poppy fields in Afganistan.

895 2018-01-25 21:47:37 I finished a book and my oil change isn't finished yet. I just want to go home
896 2018-01-25 21:47:36 And prices might not be lower forever either. Besides it better that CNRL owns their stake in the oil sands.
897 2018-01-25 21:47:23 Thou anointest my head with oil.

907 2018-01-25 21:45:54 Okay, walk with me on this tweet....but...If you could idk...somehow...bottle coconut oil and flat ginger ale, you would have made the cure for any black household sickness/skincare/injury and maybe even cancer.
908 2018-01-25 21:45:49 Without question he was only in this to make money. But until I see hard evidence (which I guess we'll see when the whole investigation is over), I'll just see all this "Russia Russia Russia" fiasco as corporate democrats trying to prevent the fall of their right-wing candidates.
909 2018-01-25 21:45:47 There is something to that.  But in this case I don't think it applies.  In the 70s it was even controversial that inflation was utlimately the fault of monetary policy.  Hence incomes policies and blaming oil prices.
910 2018-01-25 21:45:33 I took my car to get an oil change today without asking my parents to do it first or asking them to pay for it, I’m v proud of myself

941 2018-01-25 21:41:22 Just thinking this thru...if oil producers are largely hedged at lower prices for 2018, but are squeezed on cost inflation, won't they end the year worse off if prices drop towards end of year when production is higher?
942 2018-01-25 21:41:18 ATTN: 3ml 500mg peppermint oil is all I have left. $20.00 a piece & $5.00 for shipping

944 2018-01-25 21:40:46 It's not that kind of world. 60% of all oil reserves are in Muslim countries, which are demonized as a pretext for their invasion by those hegemonic countries that legitimize their rights do so because of their superabundance of weapons of WMD.

955 2018-01-25 21:38:47 Agreed, but how long did Standard Oil or Bell take to be disassembled by antitrust moves? Google and FB have issues anyway with addressable market. Maybe other corporates will drive change although the regulators need to block further Instagram type deals.

1024 2018-01-25 21:29:37 the oil is a cleanser...sometimes I switch it up bc I like foam and use the Neutrogena hydrating cleanser
1025 2018-01-25 21:29:34 But, I've heard it's good for joint pain, & have fam that uses the oil for that...
1026 2018-01-25 21:29:31 Agree. I love all the charity work the Oilers do but perhaps right now focusing on the game and wins would be more appropriate. There will be a long off season to play with the kids.
1027 2018-01-25 21:29:10 That way you won’t have to mess with that oil, I’m sure they’re easier to clean and won’t leave that much grease.  Wheatless in bowling green had the best cheese sticks I’ve ever had and they were gluten free
1028 2018-01-25 21:29:01 ANY industry could say they can’t compete internationally without steady supply of cheap foreign workers. Why are we giving Ag industry SO MUCH? It’s a payoff to GOP donors. But so are oil/gas/chemical/mining industries. Will they need cheap foreign workers next?
1029 2018-01-25 21:28:56 The trick is and always has been to get the average American to turn on his neighbor. The truly rich just laugh at it all while a guy making 6 figures who thinks he's in their league parrots everything they say.
1030 2018-01-25 21:28:53 I think there is more than enough evidence for collusion along with his dumb son..and obviously there is obstruction and then he has left a open trail of money laundering..the guy is screwed..he just does not know it yet:)
1031 2018-01-25 21:28:43 Yes. And yes. But your thesis goes down the dump when other natural oil grades (LLS, LHS, brt) also weaken against shale prone WTI Like they did over the last sessions.
1032 2018-01-25 21:28:33 It came wirh a spice packet that was a part of the recipe. Outside of water and olive oil, salt and pepper I had everything I needed in the box.
1033 2018-01-25 21:28:32 1/  Omega - 3 comes from Salmon as well.  AND Cod.  I have been taking two Omega 3 supplements Carlson's Cod Liver Oil OR Natural Factors Salmon Oil  (1000 mg)  daily for almost three decades along with THREE (3) EFAMOL brand Evening Primrose Oil (3000 mg) (Omega 6). 3:1 Ratio
1034 2018-01-25 21:28:24 Their stuff is pretty cheap too - I got 3 products for $45! so I use the steam cream, aloe vera toner and their Forest Garden Chamomile oil (it gets milky once water hits it)
1035 2018-01-25 21:28:02 @JustinTrudeau $180 million of Alberta's oil money you stole to front a world education scam. 

Line your pockets instead of helping your own First Nation people. 

Less than 20% of that will help anyone. Let more terrorists into Canada...traitor.
1036 2018-01-25 21:27:35 Bought a small bottle of white truffle oil. Smells a bit like old tennis shoes, rubber and something else. Wonder what it tastes like?  *wrinkles nose*
1037 2018-01-25 21:27:35 I've never experienced this but @AmericanAir someone stole an item from my bag and  I know it's gone because I specifically checked my for this this very reason. It's just an oil product but it's the about the principle.
1038 2018-01-25 21:27:27 Hahaha puede que te dé un poco de náuseas y dolor de cabeza, pero nada grave. Yo hago IF por 11-12 horas y trato de romperlo con un licuado (leche almendras, peanut butter, coconut oil, proteína) ;)
1039 2018-01-25 21:27:27 .......to impede solar power is a choice to FOOLISHLY cause history to repeat itself AGAIN! Just like what happen to Mr. Nikola Tesla!THIS SMELLS OF ROTTEN CRUDE OIL...........
1040 2018-01-25 21:27:25 Im outta my weed oil cartridge 
1041 2018-01-25 21:27:18 I use the Bondi Sands Oil and can scrub off and do new fresh layer same night. I usually use baby oil +creamy soap with exfoliating mit. Slap loads of the baby oil + soap together and kinda leave it on for 3/4 mins to soak in, then scrub! Normally works for me!xx
1042 2018-01-25 21:27:12 They use these for oil platforms - trust me, it beats being stuck on a vessel full of flammable stuff when it's on fire.
1043 2018-01-25 21:27:05 I got some oil
1044 2018-01-25 21:26:52 I love how creme of nature Argan oil makes my hair feel and look but there is too much fragrance in it and it gives me a headache. Have anyone tried the mango line I'm going to give it a try next
1045 2018-01-25 21:26:52 I USUALLY bake mine in the Oven for about 40 minutes. Black pepper,  a little OLIVE oil a little water BAKE  At 325.  Nice and Tender.
1046 2018-01-25 21:26:51 We’ll easily afford to pay our EU member fee with the same cash England will be paying us for oil, gas, hydroelectricity, wind power, wave power, and satellites. Whisky, gin, salmon, beef, and tons of food products too.  And we’ll save on Trident 
1047 2018-01-25 21:26:51 Coconut oil
1048 2018-01-25 21:26:45 ....wing of the party to get more popular. So this is why they do all this "Russia Russia Russia" non sense.
1049 2018-01-25 21:26:45 well, cabbage, green onion, minced pork, sesame oil, oyster sauce and also water, its the most important thing, but im gonna try this time with a light chicken stock for extra flavor!
1050 2018-01-25 21:26:42 That’s the good oil!
1051 2018-01-25 21:26:35 Oil and water still don’t mix.
1052 2018-01-25 21:26:31 You sleep you can get up to 500k miles on a Toyota and only have to change the oil and get new tires 
1053 2018-01-25 21:26:29 I’m 4A-B. I use Maui Moisture and the thick/curly products from Shea Moisture. Always have a thick oil like castor or olive bcus of my porosity. Oh, and Motions products! I don’t waste money on high end stuff.
1054 2018-01-25 21:26:26 Fickle @POTUS - he has said a weak dollars is good for selling american stuff & now it's the dollar will get stronger, high oil prices is good for certain states economies and jobs but the rest of us lose at the pump, he accused @POTUS44 of picking winners and picks winners - WTF
1055 2018-01-25 21:26:09 ....the fact that their candidate (Hillary) lost to someone who didn't even want to win (Trump). She lost what should have been the easiest election victory ever. The right-wing of the democratic party does not want to admit that. They definitely don't want the Bernie Sanders...
1056 2018-01-25 21:26:08 And how much are corporations paying in capital gains taxes when they buy back shares in their own companies? Can we get a 0% tax rate in oil investments in ANY account, not just a retirement account to pay for either oil, INFLATION, currency trade or the rent/mortgage?Thank you!
1057 2018-01-25 21:26:01 And how well did solar panels and wind energy help the northeast this winter.  The mostly run on oil.  Should we just make them freeze?
1058 2018-01-25 21:25:59 now have ship with tons of oil on it spilled and now in bottom of sea as sank they say not going to do much damage what a laugh to say such a thing many a sea animal many attempt to save bless u ones do this work saving the animals but man is just doing too much damage -
1059 2018-01-25 21:25:42 Did you care that your climate goals were also undermined by an "emissions reductions" bill, drafted by the oil industry, which actually blocks  local districts from reducing emissions? #ab398

If you want to be a champion, fix that.
1060 2018-01-25 21:25:39 They passed CHIP with the budget extension..they would have certainly liked to eliminate that..problem with some of the dumbass rich in this country is they complain of welfare..but the thieves steal money from the average americans everyday.
1061 2018-01-25 21:25:05 Actually, I don't think they'll catch Trump in anything. I mean, there is no evidence he "colluded" with Russia. I'm not trying to defend him, but I think all this Russia talk is just the right-wing corporate democrats trying to divert attention away from....
1062 2018-01-25 21:25:05 What is your recommendation for beard oil?
1063 2018-01-25 21:25:02 Suboh, bukak penjan, amalan experiment sejak 2 bulan lepas. InshaAllah rezeki dtg. Solat 2 rakaat. Mun ada lavender oil ya tunokkannya supaya segar otak. Dr segi scientific o2 mencurah2 masok. Tp mok ada netting lah mun x askar2 kecik hitam berbelang tarian berkawad sia.
1064 2018-01-25 21:25:00 Took my car in for an oil change. When I got it back:

The speedometer had been changed from MPH to km/h
The efficiency display had been changed to a different mode
When I turned the radio on (I turn it off before taking the car in as a courtesy) it was set to FM rather than CD
1065 2018-01-25 21:24:59 Dipped my hair in a pan of motor oil and shattered my phone screen. What a day
1066 2018-01-25 21:24:59 oil is too pricey i think im gonna start biking everywhere
1067 2018-01-25 21:24:57 Kakamiss si ate oyi at ang chili oil nila
1068 2018-01-25 21:24:51 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1069 2018-01-25 21:24:49 Except for 1/3rd of Europe's oil and gas reserves & 1/4 of Europe's renewables capacity & Europe's 4th largest financial centre in Edinburgh. Not to mention world leading scientific research establishment's
1070 2018-01-25 21:24:40 Swiftly banked... sean perched on an oil barrel 
1071 2018-01-25 21:24:35 Rob, it's obvious this team isn't as good as everyone thought. Expectations are not an excuse for the failure that has happened. I would like to know what you think is the reason? Also, why last year and not this year? Surely the players must bear some burden? Coach too? Or what?
1072 2018-01-25 21:24:17 Could this have something to do with oil?
1073 2018-01-25 21:24:16 Oil Change
1074 2018-01-25 21:24:06 Weigh out four pounds of olive oil then set aside.
1075 2018-01-25 21:24:01 Lucky you found oil and hungry corporations in US & Europe found you. Otherwise history wouldn't have been so nice to KRG.
1076 2018-01-25 21:23:58 The Mag.Act also covers oil. Exxon Oil has a way to get the $600B worth of difficult to recover oil from Russian waters. Retired Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson(current Sec. of State)& Trump will be paid $$$$$ to remove sanctions. Flynn started trying 11 min. after the inaugeration.
1077 2018-01-25 21:23:55 Americas Energy dominance can surpass Putins Oil & gas industry by 2019.

This is how we beat a culture that only knows war.

#AmericaFirst
1078 2018-01-25 21:23:54 I work in oil drilling so not normal  and one of the crew said his 16 year old son said "he wants to be treated like an adult" so my colleague punched him in the face 
1079 2018-01-25 21:23:52 As a child my grandfather and father would take me out into the woods to do landscape painting. During these times I developed a deep connection with the natural world. They would oil paint and I would paint my masterpiece for a few minutes and then go explore the woods.
1080 2018-01-25 21:23:42 Sameerah told us is d best oil out there
1081 2018-01-25 21:23:29 Only coconut oil
1082 2018-01-25 21:23:27 Marco Rubio is Elliot Management “The Vulture” Paul Singer’s little bitch. Paul Singer (“distressed assets specialist”) bought Macri’s “election” in Argentina. Hawks & Vultures (Neocons & neolibs) pushing for regime change in Venezuela to control oil market.
1083 2018-01-25 21:23:24 Heh, that's why I don't play Gold anymore. To much stupidity that affects the price. Same with oil. Hate both...don't care how many sweepers come for these.
1084 2018-01-25 21:22:54 My skin has been acting up so I drenched my self in coconut and lavender oil bc go big or go home right???.. lol
1085 2018-01-25 21:22:39 The Abyssinian Oil and Chia Seed hand and body scrub people can't be happy about their product's ad showing up there
1086 2018-01-25 21:22:35 No alot of product makers will increase the prices on things simply because they already hear that the american workers at several companies will get $1,000 bucks .. just like watch as the price of Oil and gas goes sky high.. it happens everytime someone gets a few more pennies.
1087 2018-01-25 21:22:28 Texas has switched it's focus from oil to wind.  Wyoming needs to do the same.  Although most of Gillette's population relies on fossil fuels it is a friendly city.  Low crime, good schools and it was a very good place to raise a family, but I liked it better when it was small.
1088 2018-01-25 21:22:17 Leave it to me to lose my oil pen with a brand new cartridge smh.
1089 2018-01-25 21:22:16 heh these cities would not exist if it were not for oil and the companies that has made it possible. Cities are part of the problem.
1090 2018-01-25 21:22:14 That's fair but then again, $90(oil peaked at $90/PB) then is around 16k naira while $50($50/PB) now is 17,500 naira or so. Forex is a big factor when you talk about PPT. More money, less value.

1092 2018-01-25 21:21:46 Yeah, I'd rather run naked through a cactus field then rub myself with pepper oil then put honey on and lie on a bee hive....then get dragged by the back of a bullet train going slowly! So never ever will.i look at the fuckery!
1093 2018-01-25 21:21:41 This attitude is like treating symptoms & not curing the disease. Climate change is directly related to education, healthcare, the economy & terrorism. We need a holistic approach to public policy or we'll just keep tilting at windmills (or maybe oil rigs).
1094 2018-01-25 21:21:35 Important question, if I put beard oil in my hair will it make it grow?
1095 2018-01-25 21:21:35 @JJones816 it’s hard to throw it out there from scratch. I’m 3.5 years in and Pinterest home style vegan meals wins every time. Replace milk butter with plant butter. Organic olive oil. Replace cow milk with almond, cashew milk. Drink alkaline water. Make a fresh smoothie daily
1096 2018-01-25 21:21:25 Wasted or oil
1097 2018-01-25 21:21:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1098 2018-01-25 21:21:21 I be putting @VelvetNoirBC beard oil in my hair lmao. Hair be silky af and definitely getting thicker smh.
1099 2018-01-25 21:21:20 On a related note, US policymakers/analysts/commentators dreaming of using SDF-controlled oil resources in E Syria vs regime while avoiding reconstruction cost should ask themselves how the US protectorate in Syria will get along without outside trade or massive foreign aid.
1100 2018-01-25 21:21:14 .@DanielRaimi discussing the Permian Basin (TX), leading oil-producing region in US. Hundreds of thousands of old oil & gas wells. Also newer devt (shale & renewables). Area's been living w/ industry since 1920s.
1101 2018-01-25 21:21:08 If I printed out this tweet and wrung it out, I could squeeze out enough condescension and unearned superiority to fill an oil drum. But no matter how hard I try, not a single fact to refute my claim would be found.
1102 2018-01-25 21:21:02 Depends on farm. 

Maybe chemical and oil storage, slurry and manure storage, NVZ spreading records, permit compliance eg chickens or AD, dirty/clean water separation, abstractions, GAEC, buffers, rotation.
1103 2018-01-25 21:20:53 John D. Rockefeller wanted to dominate oil, but Microsoft wants it all, you name it: cable, media, banking, car dealerships.
1104 2018-01-25 21:20:52 As I now own 3 mechanicum armies, nuln oil and arax are the best
1105 2018-01-25 21:20:44 Buddhists and Hindus and Sikhs and Jains for the past MILLENNIUM.
If you want to hear the other side of the story, just ask. Arab oil funded propaganda might have fooled you stupid white "liberals", but they could never fool Indians, we know both sides.
1106 2018-01-25 21:20:27 Dude i fucken hate that like its not even that hard  i had to teach my ex how to check his oil and change it, i was like BRUHHHH CMON NOW
1107 2018-01-25 21:20:26 Electric $150, water $75, car payment $250, car insurance $150, Cable $100, Heat/Gas or oil $275 =$1000 @NancyPelosi you and your Democratic Party are clueless It’s very sad......
1108 2018-01-25 21:20:14 My theory is beginning to make some sense 
Bilderberg Group wealth elites like Sorros and political elites like heads of states wanted globalism 
George Bush 1 of their puppets with WMD and endless war in Middle East for mining eg oil that didn’t workout. 1/2
1109 2018-01-25 21:20:13 I get my argan and jojoba oil at Trader Joe's or Sprouts
1110 2018-01-25 21:20:06 I’m not sure if you guys watch Dave Chapelle but he was right how Trump is basically making the rich richer and the ordinary American is getting screwed, I think CHIP elimInation was a good example of that
1111 2018-01-25 21:20:01 Just my side mirror was 80$  still gotta get my breaks,transmission oil & sparks plugs changed 
1112 2018-01-25 21:19:33 Texas is investing millions in renewable energy so when the oil dips they have something to move forward with. 

What happens when oil prices go under like they did in the 80’s? 

What is Louisiana doing to help the future of our energy sector?
1113 2018-01-25 21:19:28 Me: *lathers my hair in coconut oil* “does my hair smell good”
Joel: “smells like popcorn”
1114 2018-01-25 21:19:19 It’s fixed. Just like oil
1115 2018-01-25 21:19:17 yeah. This is literally my nuln oil in this case.

1118 2018-01-25 21:19:09 All these people just put ‘ade agbon’ in bottle and call it beard oil. Nothing works for me so far

1122 2018-01-25 21:18:57 @VinnieTortorich dr warned me of high calories in olive oil when I explained my 20 lb loss. #NSNG (talking to a wall)
1123 2018-01-25 21:18:56 I use it as much as people use Nuln Oil.
1124 2018-01-25 21:18:50 I take melatonin and have an oil diffuser with lavender and eucalyptus oil in it.

1130 2018-01-25 21:18:23 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the harsh conditions of these fields.
1131 2018-01-25 21:18:17 yep he sure is... selling his Snake oil to the youngsters... with promises of FREE stuff (they arent old enough yet to realize.. NOthing is FREE in life... also noting older folks who havent learned still want free stuff too)

1143 2018-01-25 21:17:09 It is true that the Trump Regime has been so chaotic. Every day he is attacking, instead of fixing our issues.  His lies will bury him.
Remember one of the first things this Republican Congress tried to remove was the Ethics Committee.
Oil deals for Russia, with NRA COLLUSION.
1144 2018-01-25 21:16:33 Pls show us what you achieved as former minister wth PDP, if no achievement was made,  then crude oil is even better than you.
1145 2018-01-25 21:16:24 Not so fast.  Look at it a diff way. $ZCL (Zk-snarks few understand how it truly works - edge) - you get that coin - of course fork adjusted you make a decision - but $BTCP - IS anonymous BTC.   Who wouldn’t want it?    It’s speculative but far from snake oil.
1146 2018-01-25 21:16:19 First it was a oil issue then it was a money issue, now this; what's next a gender issue?

1148 2018-01-25 21:16:15 The aviation fuel, the diesel for the truck, and the oil burned to heat the water, could produce more electricity (at the right time to meet demand) than the unfrozen wind turbine could ever produce, before it freezes up again.

1154 2018-01-25 21:15:50 To get real green run French fry oil in genny and set genny in trunk of car, put some pot plants in back seat for in cab C02 collection. That way when you get the munchies you can just stop at a fry shack for a snack and fuel. No limits and all green!
1155 2018-01-25 21:15:44 Was watching BBC #BigCats and saw what deforestation and palm oil were doing to Bay Cats so decided to donate.
1156 2018-01-25 21:15:43 To fix the “problem” a helicopter is employed (burning aviation fuel) to spray hot water (which is heated in the frigid temperatures using a truck equipped with a 260 kW oil burner) on the blades of the turbine to de-ice them.

1162 2018-01-25 21:14:43 I was just tweeting that. Remember reading the issue while getting my oil changed at a Jiffy Lube.
1163 2018-01-25 21:14:25 You can cook them, if you do I’d keep it simple and sauté them in olive oil, but I prefer them raw myself
1164 2018-01-25 21:14:05 His point is, during GEJ a barrel of oil goes for 16,830 naira compared the current rate of 17,500 naira. Thanks to a weak naira. You dig?

1177 2018-01-25 21:12:01 The Bay Cat is another example of palm oil screwing up the rainforests! There needs to be a way to differentiate between sustainable and non sustainable palm oil for consumers. Supermarkets need to get on this #BigCats

1183 2018-01-25 21:11:25 Yes and Please Kale is overrated and expensive. Ugu works just fine for me; N50 ugu sautéed in a drop of olive oil with some yaji serves as an amazing breakfast that will hold you.

1184 2018-01-25 21:11:24 Let us all pretend shale oil can replace conventional oil. Why would Chiang of PAA say in a conference call that our refiners do now want API gravity 45 oil from Permian?

1186 2018-01-25 21:10:37 Yeah but if I had to bet, they (friends/family) used currency markets. Using the Euro is one of the more sure ways to play the dollar short term (yes, even more than oil). It wouldn't shock me if an associate was informed ahead of time, and played the Euro accordingly.

1193 2018-01-25 21:10:02 Funnily enough, I was recently wondering why they seem to be able to pump oil long-distance through bloody great pipelines, but not water.
1194 2018-01-25 21:10:00 Oil on the road
1195 2018-01-25 21:09:54 Post-Volcker Fed's reactions to oil shocks or "threat" of inflation is one reason why a NGDP target seems superior to inflation target. 

Like you suggest though, given the confluence of trends happening today, the cycle looks poised to continue. It feels like a sweet spot.
1196 2018-01-25 21:09:50 Not really a great point. They’ve lagged oil the whole way up. If you were using that as your indicator you would not think oil could have made this move it has.
1197 2018-01-25 21:09:46 Optimum Nutrition Fish Oil, my favorite brand!
1198 2018-01-25 21:09:33 Perks of working at a car dealership means I can get an oil change while I work and have it come right out of my pay so it feels free lol
1199 2018-01-25 21:09:28 if your skin can handle it, coconut oil worked well for me but JUST applied there. also, if you have a dermatologist, get it checked out because it may be more than just cracked skin. I thought mine was, but it was stress induced eczema.
1200 2018-01-25 21:09:25 i don't understand anything about skincare. i don't know what a coconut oil is and i don't want to
1201 2018-01-25 21:09:25 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

1205 2018-01-25 21:08:55 If that shit working, keep using the oil then. This what sulfate free, & no sodium i needa see what it’s hitting for. I just want it to hydrate my hair and make it poppin 
1206 2018-01-25 21:08:37 Does avocado oil work? I like avocado
1207 2018-01-25 21:08:20 Literally bathed in thieves oil and sanitized EVERYTHING! I can’t even handle all the sickness right now! #stayawaygerms
1208 2018-01-25 21:08:18 I misread this twice . nah i went into a skincare thread on cgl and decided that I don't trust anything I read on the internet now. idk anything about coconut oil
1209 2018-01-25 21:08:17 Yep..exactly my point Oil futures are overvalued right now..too high too fast..
1210 2018-01-25 21:08:15 You learn something from one's expense reports. The premium gas, yes. Drew's vehicle had a low oil pressure warning that Albertans made sure he didn't go out of pocket to fix. He enjoys meals at Earls, and halibut steaks while talking healthcare at the private Cypress Club...
1211 2018-01-25 21:08:07 I agree. this is no coincidence. The Trump family is probably the most corrupt and unethical family in the US. Oil is involved. They have to know that talking the dollar takes oil up.
1212 2018-01-25 21:07:55 Thank you both for your positive actions and awareness of palm oil!

1216 2018-01-25 21:07:40 The inability to combine the BDSM community and Open Source Software is an oil and water situation I probably should have expected.
1217 2018-01-25 21:07:39 It looks super shady. It wouldn't shock me knowing Trump's history. How does he have his administration one day talk the dollar down, then the next day CLEARLY promote a strong dollar?

1224 2018-01-25 21:06:46 How about the realization that this team isn't as good as many made them out be? Last season everything went great but that hasn't been the case this season and expectations have got the better of them. Why does it always have to be about as supposed lack of effort.

1260 2018-01-25 21:02:53 You didn't answer the question, you just said that scientists aren't making money (agreed) 
If the scientists are lying they are doing the same work as oil industry lobbyist, and in a capitalist society they should have the same salary. Yet we know this is not the case, why not?

1291 2018-01-25 20:59:08 You need to take some time and discover the answer to that very important question.  It is oil trading 101.  If you honestly do not know, you should not be investing in oil.  Good-luck
1292 2018-01-25 20:59:07 Hilarious:
• Monbiot rips into soya as environmentally catastrophic
• thinks it’s grown to feed cattle
• whereas soya feed is only a byproduct of oil extraction - otherwise wasted
• oil used to make “milk” for humans 
• that other vegans think should replace proper milk!

1294 2018-01-25 20:59:03 It's like Koresh said - annointed with the Oil of Gladness
1295 2018-01-25 20:58:59 But we have no control over our appetite in this; this is a manufacturing issue, you don't buy palm oil in bottles in grocery stores. The manufacturers need to use sustainable alternatives

1297 2018-01-25 20:58:53 Im not currently trading at the moment since all the markets are being simply driven by a massive excess-liquidity which has severely distored even commodity values now.

I shorted Oil in December, bailed in the low 61.20s area, but got burned by that for over 7k loss.
1298 2018-01-25 20:58:52 This Bitch Said An Hour And A Half For An Oil Change And Wipers, I'm Sick
1299 2018-01-25 20:58:50 They r just polarizing the state and demonizing our politics,heating the polity,baba is getting power drunk,I pray their actions dnt lead to a major bloodbath in our dear state.
1300 2018-01-25 20:58:49 Omg my auntie is going to own a Chip oil! 
1301 2018-01-25 20:58:35 Why these jiffy lube men lookin at my car like they concerned??? Pls just change the oil and let me leave
1302 2018-01-25 20:58:29 The maintenance is pretty standard. Lol. Light comes on & go to toyota to get your free oil change & whatever else comes with it
1303 2018-01-25 20:58:26 Fairly sizeable puke in energy equities despite small-ish moves in commodities.  May portend more downside to come for oil and natty g/aka the widowmaker.

That's because your thick mate
Solid bone from the neck up

If you keep going on we'll nab Ozil and Wiltshire next and use them as ball boys.
1308 2018-01-25 20:58:15 It’s always important to oil the hinges. I’m talkin mental, physical, spiritual. The small stuff means everything. Today I focused on physical. Thanks @core40studios
1309 2018-01-25 20:58:11 my skinhas been looking gREAT lately tea tree oil really is gonna save me
1310 2018-01-25 20:57:59 The ones I like are First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer, CeraVe AM, and Neutrogena Hydro Boost. Also Squalane oil and hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary will help.
1311 2018-01-25 20:57:44 Now that oil is $70 and foreign reserve is $40B, when is the dollar going to Exchange for N200? Or are they no longer related factors?
1312 2018-01-25 20:57:43 #ABHeartland @ 20. C. Rothrock, chief economist goa:

- sync’d global growth 
- lower interest rates continue 
- dollar strengthening
- global oil market rebalancing
- AB recovery, 2.5% growth, but prolonged recovery
1313 2018-01-25 20:57:18 I can see that. But kwankwaso is always thinking two steps ahead
1314 2018-01-25 20:57:13 Public accounting, oil industry refining, oil trading light end of barrel (gas, diesel, jet fuel), real estate development, banking/refinancing troubled loans, tax planning/shelters, help families grow/sell businesses (protect them from Wall Street types), healthcare cost mgmt.
1315 2018-01-25 20:57:11 I suspect some insider trading going on by family and friends of Trump. Maybe no oil insider trading, but currency markets insider trading. What happened the last few days makes zero sense. But a ton of money could have been made by any Trump associate just in currency markets.
1316 2018-01-25 20:57:07 My son has a glioblastoma.he was diagnosed in 2015. We’ve had him on cannabis oil since then and he was stable for over 2 years. It helps . Now he’s having immunotherapy in Cologne at iozk clinic .
1317 2018-01-25 20:56:48 Aha blooming predictive text “oil”
1318 2018-01-25 20:56:48 I'm all for equality and so was my wife, until we swapped rolls, she now works away on the oil rigs working her ass off while I stay at home with the kids ! Heaven. *some of the details in this tweet may not be true* but you get my drift 
1319 2018-01-25 20:56:41 I’m applying lemongrass essential oil to my third eye for intuition. 
Is my intuition supposed to burn?
1320 2018-01-25 20:56:34 It creeps me out every time I get my oil changed because you have the guys working up around the car, then sometimes you’ll feel a push & it’s the guy working below. 
1321 2018-01-25 20:56:15 Oil and gas
1322 2018-01-25 20:56:11 
1323 2018-01-25 20:56:04 Big Oil calls them gravy with there super fast rising gas prices. Tax relief and bonuses r going to Big Oil. Wait until Exxon reports last Qtr. . Plenty of gas and crude. Congress lets Big Oil export again.  What say u Kirk?  Exxon got your tongue!
1324 2018-01-25 20:55:53 We had a bullock home slaughtered so we have a lot of beef so anything to vary it a bit and I shall try that, thanks!
1325 2018-01-25 20:55:51 My ideal salad is a mix of dark greens and kale with mandarin oranges, some sort of seed and nut combo, a million crunchy sticks or chips or wontons whatever and some HOT like fresh off the grill, sliced chicken. And an oil based dressing. WITH LEMON. THANKS!
1326 2018-01-25 20:55:51 The money came from the oil and other nationalised services. As I said, money was invested back into the country for the people. That's the point of nationalised services.
1327 2018-01-25 20:55:13 Alaska's experience was basically a dividend from oil production. A dwindling dividend. It's not much of an income, really, and not a valid model. The best that #UBI enthusiasts can come up with is a paltry pocket money scheme. I'm not impressed. That money would have done more..
1328 2018-01-25 20:55:12 Put castor oil or vitamin e oil on your beard it will be less patchy and grow
1329 2018-01-25 20:55:11 Yea,baba is doing many political miscalculations...He is surrounded by many Judas...
1330 2018-01-25 20:55:10 Evolving. It's lib approved. 
1331 2018-01-25 20:55:05 One oil change and boom. I end up paying for 700 dollars worth of shit..
1332 2018-01-25 20:54:56 My third box from @brandless arrived yesterday, and I'm in love with their lemon verbena hand lotion and their coconut oil is freaking adorable. I can't wait for their product selection to grow and grow and take over the world. #toomuch

1335 2018-01-25 20:54:46 Yes, just keep on deregulating until our oceans are filled with oil and many species of wildlife disappear. Polluting the planet seems to be a goal of yours.
1336 2018-01-25 20:54:45 What’s a good hair growth oil 
1337 2018-01-25 20:54:30 So in one day you can have all:  1/2 an avocado, olives, nuts/seeds, olive oil, grass-fed beef
1338 2018-01-25 20:54:25 i smell oil rice
1339 2018-01-25 20:54:21 lol for a long time I've been wondering why Lagosians eat roasted plantain with groundnut and i just realised it's called Boli, because what we eat in Port Harcourt is called Boleh, this little difference here is palm oil and pepper gravy with roasted fish of course. Bon appétit!
1340 2018-01-25 20:54:18 It would depend on the type of mayo. In its basic form I thought mayo was oil, eggs and something acidic like vinegar or lemon juice. I think anything else is added for flavor
1341 2018-01-25 20:54:14 Russia = China's top crude oil supplier in December for the 10th month + racked up its 2nd year as the largest supplier in 2017, leaving rival exporter Saudi Arabia in 2nd place on both fronts < Russia's full-year supply = 1.194 million bpd #Oil #Russia #China #SaudiArabia
1342 2018-01-25 20:54:12 What you are lacking is not a helper, you are lacking oil. The anointing helps you to recover your losses.

1343 2018-01-25 20:54:03 Oil only went up this week because of non-oil MMs running into commodities based on an irrelevant comment by Mnuchin. Why a portion of MMs run into commodities went currency markets make big changes? I don't know. It all has nothing to do with oil reality #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CL_F
1344 2018-01-25 20:53:47 Payback to kwankwaso u mean?
1345 2018-01-25 20:53:39 After Chavez was Rameriz who worked under Chavez but is massively corrupt and selling off the national oil to private companies again. Hence the riots and people not being allowed to vote to get rid of him. He has even left the country I believe. They don't want capitalism again
1346 2018-01-25 20:53:35 I mainly use olive and coconut oil - I’ll pay more attention to the ingredients list for vegetable oil
1347 2018-01-25 20:53:26 Cheaper $ / lower taxes. More bang for buck, potential for appreciation of value.
1348 2018-01-25 20:53:23 #WTI #CrudeOil #CL_F #OOTT #OPEC So munchkin from Trump Admin says weak dollar is good yesterday...oil flies....and then they retract today..Maybe these clowns..munchkin, oops perry and our dear leader should also be investigated for collusion with Big Oil and OPEC:)
1349 2018-01-25 20:53:22 I love to cook with olive oil, but why must most chefs have to drizzle on their meal at the end, I can't stand too much oil all over , love your show and watched from the beginning ,
1350 2018-01-25 20:53:19 nature’s bounty hair skin and nail gummies, any shampoo / conditioner with coconut oil, and Sephora/ulta has good hair masks!!
1351 2018-01-25 20:53:10 Taking a self care day by giving myself a hot oil treatment and a face mask.
1352 2018-01-25 20:53:10 It will pay 3 months of car payments or most of 1 months rent or food for a month or 300 gallons of oil for my apt. 3 months of car insurance
1353 2018-01-25 20:53:01 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other. #fz7
1354 2018-01-25 20:53:00 Cool. But pissed oil like a racehorse @Matt_r_taylor74  !
1355 2018-01-25 20:52:42 You're obviously not on the payroll of the big oil companies
1356 2018-01-25 20:52:41 "And I didn't even have to use baby oil or nothing"
1357 2018-01-25 20:52:34 There are many things happening around the oil mines, to which are you referring?
1358 2018-01-25 20:52:08 Wash, dry, cut in half. Spray inside of a square baking pan, add sprouts. Quick drizzle of olive oil, top w/ kosher salt & freshly ground pepper. Roast at 400*F for 25 minutes. Top w/ crumbled bacon and bake 5 more minutes. Top w/ freshly shredded Parmesan & serve.
So delicious!
1359 2018-01-25 20:52:04 Rick is right. Royalties are not taxes. They are not profits-based (aside from oil sands); they are a resource cost applied to the developer by the owner. Royalties are tax deductible, though. To a private owner of freehold title, no company ever says they are paying “taxes”
1360 2018-01-25 20:51:44 Needa get s mf oil change
1361 2018-01-25 20:51:41 "You got a blown gasket, your driver side headlight is out, you need new ball joints, your antifreeze is low, and your brake line's been cut - you still just want your oil changed?"

Like damn bruh I was cool before I got here...
1362 2018-01-25 20:51:28 as gas goes higher and grocery prices rise.  This is what happens when wages and oil prices rise!  TIC TOC BUBBLE SOON WILL POP
1363 2018-01-25 20:51:25 In need of an oil change
1364 2018-01-25 20:51:17 Russian mid-sized oil producer Tatneft started up naphtha hydrotreater & isomerisation units on Thursday at its TANEKO oil refinery to improve the quality of gasoline it produces #Oil #Russia #Tatneft #taneko
1365 2018-01-25 20:51:01 Yes coffee works incredible well along side beef and other ingredients
1366 2018-01-25 20:51:00 Ps .obama,threw land mines to prevent oil drilling
1367 2018-01-25 20:50:54 Lol, I agree with it. But I’m sure that u can get over it, add oil!
1368 2018-01-25 20:50:53 Sugarcane and groundnut oil
1369 2018-01-25 20:50:53 Does it come with a free bag of gas or oil or something? 
1370 2018-01-25 20:50:44 Tea tree oil is amazing. I like the one from Trader Joe's. It does have a strong scent so be mindful of that.
1371 2018-01-25 20:50:37 My takeaways from the @IPAAaccess Private Capital Conference: Expect to see more active IPO market for E&Ps later this year, look for market to focus more on building returns and FCF, and Daniel Rice's mom's house in Boston still runs on fuel oil. #oott
1372 2018-01-25 20:50:20 Coffee?
1373 2018-01-25 20:50:16 Dude it's not your oil, it's still our oil...

1377 2018-01-25 20:49:57 More than halfway thru cooking beans and I realise I don't have enough palm oil
1378 2018-01-25 20:49:49 my dad would kill me if he knew i literally just filled the oil in my car for the first time since moving here
1379 2018-01-25 20:49:40 A grand would help quite a bit right now, covers a season worth of heating oil, 6-8 weeks of groceries for the family, big #jeep tires...
1380 2018-01-25 20:49:36 I pray that you get rid of her.
The latest scam here in Florida is that Trump said that he wanted offshore oil drilling in Florida. His BFF Florida 
Gov. RICK SCOTT made a big deal out of how He got Trump to stop offshore drilling in Florida. Yeah RIGHT 
Tell us another lie.
1381 2018-01-25 20:49:29 You don't "borrow" a Van Gogh.  And who would lend it to a guy who might get fried chicken oil and Cheetos dust all over it?
1382 2018-01-25 20:49:28 Rob, what's your take on this? If it's not practice habits or players? Is it coaching? GM? What narrative would classify as being industrious?
1383 2018-01-25 20:49:20 Mechanic says it's all the engine. Needs a new OB2 to hook it up for diagnostics. It will need another flush because of how long it went without an oil change, and he will check for warping. No tranny problems. whew
1384 2018-01-25 20:49:19 The joke is on you and many others who pretend not to know that oil is the life wire of Nigerian economy and once it slumped to that all time low in years it’ll affect the economy and jobs.
Or you think the words global meltdown was derived from EPL when it happened?
1385 2018-01-25 20:49:16 Have you been paying attention to what’s been happening in the oil fields of Nigeria? Or the gold and diamond mines?

1391 2018-01-25 20:48:51 Or it's the lazy narrative some continue to fall back on when things aren't going smoothly. Funny how every young skilled Oilers player is lazy 
1392 2018-01-25 20:48:45 Did oil go up again?
1393 2018-01-25 20:48:31 Cd it be that it's a veneer, given his background? Actions spk louder than words. SThree, oil co money, Damascene conversion to CofE for locals, aggressive tax avoidance, hidden non-Westminster earnings. I could go on. Public school smooth, yet transparent.
1394 2018-01-25 20:48:31 my dads way of showing he loves me is telling me to check my tire pressure and see how many miles i have on my oil. life of a mechanics daughter 
1395 2018-01-25 20:48:29 I wanted a truck sooo bad until I started driving Zach's. Gas is expensive af and his oil change is 100 and that's with a coupon 
1396 2018-01-25 20:48:22 While oil beef hooked
1397 2018-01-25 20:48:14 Update: received 5$ off my oil change for Sandra
1398 2018-01-25 20:48:12 Wow! Great essential oil class today.
1399 2018-01-25 20:48:05 Honestly, where I'm from, it's a fairly common sentiment. But even for Oil City, PA, it's pretty insane, and people in power need to stop giving voice to these nuts-- on that I totally agree.
1400 2018-01-25 20:47:55 Sadly America is owned by the rich..oil, war, banking, a few others..  They bribe our elected people and WRITE our laws...we must remove their power to bribe our elected people.
1401 2018-01-25 20:47:52 Yes yes. have you seen Tumblr? someone said in this scene when jaz tilts  her head up, it is so beautifully lit, and her hands are on Flor’s head that it looks like an oil painting of Jesus and called it Jaz-us. Jaz as the Lesbian Jesus.  #Flozmin
1402 2018-01-25 20:47:50 @Nestle Nestlé to finally cut ties with REPSA and hold the palm oil supplier to account for the environmental and social harm it caused in Sayaxché.

1404 2018-01-25 20:47:36 Big shout out to the oil giants BP, Exxon, and Chevron. Keep on bidding for the rights to my oil, there is no ceiling!
1405 2018-01-25 20:47:27 Waiting an hour+ for an oil change,  just how I wanted to spend my afternoon  — feeling frustrated
1406 2018-01-25 20:47:19 I do hear though that tissue oil and water is really good for marks on your face and for your skin and I’ve been trying that a lot recently. Have a go. Everyone’s skin is different. Maybe even try egg whites... or was that for dry skin..  girl google this
1407 2018-01-25 20:46:50 since people think water is wet is oil oily?
1408 2018-01-25 20:46:47 Imagine actually moving from Monaco to Southampton. 

From casinos, tax havens and fast, expensive cars, to undisturbed views of Fawley oil refinery and a daily commute over the Millbrook Flyover.

I like him already!

1432 2018-01-25 20:42:23 Great. Hope @JohnKerry runs. He relates to the average American as well as blood and oil. He's a real elitist. He comes across as a snob, white, rich guy that can't relate to the little people.

1441 2018-01-25 20:40:43 Use vitamin E oil as lip gloss. Has the same effect and is better for your lips
1442 2018-01-25 20:40:40 You’re welcome! If your skin is flaky and dry then we would recommend our Marula oil serum, the vitamin ace moisturiser is great for all skin types

1456 2018-01-25 20:39:38 Which nail on the head? That response is bereft of common sense. Go and look at crude oil production/sales figures of both countries and come back and answer why we’re borrowing more for less budget

1472 2018-01-25 20:37:33 Yeah, that never happened. The collpase of Venezuela is because Chavez and his cronies were stupid,  they built their entire country's economy and social programs around  exporting Oil, then when Oil prices dropped Venezuela collapsed.

1556 2018-01-25 20:26:14 I hate palm oil.... It needs to stop.... Habitats are demonising and animals are suffering!! #PalmOil @dan710ths @DeborahMeaden
1557 2018-01-25 20:26:12 Got a feeling the grass or lack of it is about the same on either side of a fence. #BuildTheWallNow
1558 2018-01-25 20:25:57 Crazy thing is We'll soon Find out how many other despots have been British PM since.
Never ending wars designed to make the rich richer and sacrifice poor Brit soldiers for oil and weapons barons. 
Its an Eton Cabal.
Where's the next war.
Oil rich Iran?
Mineral rich North Korea
1559 2018-01-25 20:25:55 precisely aligned spouts and handles have almost no bearing on latte art if training is competent: it’s snake oil
1560 2018-01-25 20:25:48 A cod liver oil capsule stick in my throat and I wanna rip my throat out oui 
1561 2018-01-25 20:25:41 Make sure you're clothed while cooking. Oil spatter around delicates is no joke.
1562 2018-01-25 20:25:22 my sister accidently poured hella peppermint essential oil on my hand and now it BURNS
1563 2018-01-25 20:25:21 Our fx reserve is now back to $40B from $24B @ a time of lower oil price. We won't hand the key to the "yam eaters" again!
#PMB'19
1564 2018-01-25 20:25:20 I should probably mince all this garlic and preserve it in oil since we have a years supply now 
1565 2018-01-25 20:25:11 #BigCats showing what a disgusting thing palm oil is, huge threat to habitat and species. Difficult to avoid in products, but possible.
1566 2018-01-25 20:25:00 In contrast, wind farms don't usually explode. In all seriousness, it's a shame good men die for oil. And communities are built, destroyed, and laid to waste to line the pockets of the elite. #KeepItInTheGround
1567 2018-01-25 20:24:56 If a vegan girl offers to feed you her vegan taco do you bring hot sauce or massage oil?
1568 2018-01-25 20:24:53 So glad my conch piercing is finally healing after 6 months. Keloids are a bitch. Thank God for tea tree oil
1569 2018-01-25 20:24:50 Abbotsford, BC, sells land to dirty, filthy oil company, kinder morgan.  Shame.
1570 2018-01-25 20:24:50 Indeed, an argument could be made that the refusal of Corbyn and his followers to engage in, and honestly explore, how a country with $15 trillion in oil reserves can utterly collapse after two decades of socialist economic policies, indicates their disregard for Venezuela’s poor
1571 2018-01-25 20:24:42 Pumpkin seed oil on everything
1572 2018-01-25 20:24:37 For your  kind information you should know  about tears  i am a biology student dont take it serious                        
Overall, tears have almost the same composition as saliva. The film of your tears is made up of three layers including oil, water, and mucus lol   
1573 2018-01-25 20:24:36 I’m convinced the guys doing my oil change are currently laughing at all the issues my car has

1575 2018-01-25 20:24:25 @mybodycology need a Moroccan oil smell :)

1577 2018-01-25 20:24:02 feed him fish oil pills in peanut butter. it’ll help immensely
1578 2018-01-25 20:24:01 This is modi fault y u know? Balance all items they are concerned under GST but oil not concerned. You are saying states not accepting. All items states accepted only oil not accepting states? So this is PM fault only.
1579 2018-01-25 20:23:47 Clotilde Aalto, that clone-baby eating, motor oil leaking, space monster, hands down
1580 2018-01-25 20:23:46 What is castor oil 
1581 2018-01-25 20:23:38 Beats a turkey once a year.
1582 2018-01-25 20:23:18 Well where do I start, we have been asked to produce bush oil for pubic hair for women.
The name is Ladies Garden Bush oil. I guess producing high quality Beard Oil and Balms ,is a short step to pubic hair . Working with a team on scents,and will be ready in the summer .
1583 2018-01-25 20:23:16 Nah! the Pakis have no Oil, but they have great hiding places.
1584 2018-01-25 20:23:12 DO YOU KNOW WHY Norway has ALL these things? EnOrmous OIL reserves, LOW unemployment ( until the migrants) REAL education , not Gender " studies" industriousness & a relatively TINY population. It's ALSO the MOST expensive country in the world. Research it.
1585 2018-01-25 20:22:43 I agree with coconut oil or olive oil that will help from the inside out 
1586 2018-01-25 20:22:42 So this time around while twisting my hair I did LCO (liquid, cream, oil) instead of LOC & I’m praying my twist out turns out right 
1587 2018-01-25 20:22:42 that is so 3rd world. it's mostly palm oil as well
1588 2018-01-25 20:22:34 Not just the health of the people but the ecosystem. It took Carmarthen Bay inlet nearly 10 years to return to normal health after an oil spill in Milford, 62 miles away! Why aren’t they looking into the consequences of this decision.
1589 2018-01-25 20:22:30 Crude Oil Price Now $80 Per Barrel.

Definitely, PMB Will Save The Money..
1590 2018-01-25 20:22:19 Won’t happen that fast, looks like oil could pull-back here a bit. Will happen over the next month or two.
1591 2018-01-25 20:22:07 Just the partisan grifters looking for grants to churn out nonsense by the truckload.
1592 2018-01-25 20:22:05 OMG THEY TRULY ARE INSANE
1593 2018-01-25 20:22:00 NPDC Targets 500,000 Barrels of Crude Oil Per Day Production

Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC)one of the upstream subsidiaries of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), will increase its daily crude oil production to 500,000 barrels per day before 2022.
1594 2018-01-25 20:21:57 You'll see stuff about "Never use soap, Only salt & water, Etc." When mine are washed, I use dish soap & scouring pad. Dry them(Don't let them air dry) & apply a light film of oil. The key is always oil them after cleaning. That's the key. 
Happy Cooking With Your Skillet.
1595 2018-01-25 20:21:47 Daily evening primrose oil capsules, all month long, seem to help me. Took one month off a few years ago just to see, and it was hellish.

But - have you been to doc? Maybe endometriosis? Really common. And awful. Pretty sure there’s other things they can do to help.
1596 2018-01-25 20:21:24 Just made a pasta sauce from what was in the kitchen: two tomatoes, red onion, frozen chopped spinach, olive oil, parmesan cheese, salt & pepper. Surprisingly tasty!
1597 2018-01-25 20:21:18 I’m finna kill the game with my beard oil 
1598 2018-01-25 20:21:12 Idt it’ll EVER be as much as it cost you to own a vehicle. I’m sure it probably cost me less to get to work in a month than the insurance you pay for your car. Or the gas you put in, or tires, oil, the list goes on forever.
1599 2018-01-25 20:21:05 Church folks so funny, man! “No oil.” Im weak.
1600 2018-01-25 20:20:37 A few portraits I've painted recently. All are life-size oil on canvas.
1601 2018-01-25 20:20:33 Oil as well?
1602 2018-01-25 20:20:31 Shop on Etsy?
1603 2018-01-25 20:20:01 What exactly? Sugar? Palm oil? 
1604 2018-01-25 20:19:58 I remember someone telling me that they add oil to their rice so it doesn't clump together I was horrified
1605 2018-01-25 20:19:53 Venezuela is actually an amazing example of why capitalism doesn't work. The oil was private owned and 1% were rich. Chavez nationalised it and built homes hospitals. Jobs created and country really moving. When he left it collapsed after 2 years of corruption and capitalism.
1606 2018-01-25 20:19:51 Same  try hemp oil. But make sure it's pure/organic
1607 2018-01-25 20:19:43 I usually use coconut oil and conditioner but the back of his hair dries out so bad
1608 2018-01-25 20:19:43 Media cared about Obama associations about as much as Hillary exposing national security secrets. 0 interest
1609 2018-01-25 20:19:32 i finally decided to try oil pulling with coconut oil 

anybody doing it?? any benefits? horror stories? tell me
1610 2018-01-25 20:19:19 Long $BA and $BABA feb16 calls, could have been up pretty big but the oil field clients wanted to hold a meeting, missed my sell window
1611 2018-01-25 20:19:13 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1612 2018-01-25 20:19:03 I need someone to come with me to get my oil changed
1613 2018-01-25 20:19:00 As long as it’s pure Jamaican castor oil it’s safe.
1614 2018-01-25 20:18:39 Working on an Oil Rig 
1615 2018-01-25 20:18:15 Iraq PM Abadi at Davos today said that the KRG had agreed to hand over all of its oil revenue in return for receiving its budget share from Baghdad. KRG hasn't confirmed yet.
1616 2018-01-25 20:18:11 Hedge funds have been over 75% long gold oil copper and short dollar.  The unraveling started an hour ago.
1617 2018-01-25 20:18:07 Many wells and drilling facilities owned by companies that went bankrupt have been abandoned without proper cleanup. These deserted rigs have been nicknamed “orphaned wells”, and are beginning to worry oil and gas commissioners #oilandgas #wells #abandoned #bankruptcy #rig #ENN
1618 2018-01-25 20:18:05 fish oil has also got rid of my wicked menstrual cramps. Have shared the tip with lots of friends and colleagues and they've had the same results
1619 2018-01-25 20:17:46 Laziness is a bad idea. I have yam, groundnut oil and ingredients for stew in my house but I went and bought fried yam with stew outside 
1620 2018-01-25 20:17:46 I hear it gives you a better high and more relaxing... can reduce pain too depending on the oil you use lol
1621 2018-01-25 20:17:43 I've yet to smell a pre-blended essential oil that I was head over heels for.
1622 2018-01-25 20:17:40 try a big grey jumper worn at work with possible olive oil stains all over it that once home your dad thought were sweat stains 
1623 2018-01-25 20:17:37 You'll be better off cleaning it thoroughly, then oiling it and leave it in oven at 250 or so for an hour. Don't get caught in the "Lore" of skillet care. I've had mine for 40+ years & some are 100 years old. I scrub with soap & water then oil them lightly and put away.
1624 2018-01-25 20:17:27 どうせみんなモンハンやってるに違いない！ 分かってるんだからな！
1625 2018-01-25 20:17:24 @hainsworthtv it would be nice if guest would rate stock picks.

Low downside low gain secure
Low downside high gain possible
Big loss big gain possible
Limited damage if big correction
High damage if big correction

Value or growth not helpful
Value oil stocks don't mean gains
1626 2018-01-25 20:17:12 $USO oil likely to pullback in near term
1627 2018-01-25 20:17:06 Maybe lower state taxes?
1628 2018-01-25 20:16:45 Aaah I'll try something else but not custor oil...

1636 2018-01-25 20:16:03 I remember that quite well!! A friend of mine drove truck for oil companies, forget which now. They were driving tanker after tanker to the west dumping millions of gallons of gasoline in the desert!!
1637 2018-01-25 20:15:33 These kids went on the PP and pumped home three quick goals vs, the Oilers penalty kill.
1638 2018-01-25 20:15:26 Just thought of the worst idea ever: tea but instead of water it uses vegetable oil.
1639 2018-01-25 20:15:19 Oil, coal, base metals, Baltic Dry,  interest rates all higher. Not the same cost structure as 2016, and maybe getting worse?
1640 2018-01-25 20:15:18 Better weather.
1641 2018-01-25 20:15:14 Pure oil comes from olives that have been crushed.

1643 2018-01-25 20:14:47 Why don't you ever talk about SEC Chairmen Jay Clayton who looks the other way as WALLST. TRAITORS/VIRTU PARTNERS steal money from around the world including the USA. Does it mean anything to you that they control the CCM and the price of GAS/HEATING OIL?
1644 2018-01-25 20:14:26 Lovely. Get married where ppl defecate and expel body fluids. Really pretty gross.
1645 2018-01-25 20:14:17 Oil up the wheel chair and fire up the oxygen and go for it you old crook, that is if you and your wife aren't in prison.
1646 2018-01-25 20:14:14 Okay. Withdraw all the military from our lands, empty all the settlements. Give us our borders with Jordan, the sky, the sea and the airports. The oil fields and the prisoners and the money you stole from us and Jerusalem and Alaqsa. Then we will talk

1650 2018-01-25 20:13:55 Don’t forget. Lightly oil greaseproof paper *before* baking sweet potato wedges in your mum’s old oven that you could have burnt the whole bloody flat down with.
1651 2018-01-25 20:13:45 for a few days, while keeping the stick cold, remove it from the fridge and apply cannabis oil, and more leaves. Three layers of leaves is decent cannabis wrapping. Wrap tightly with parchment paper, and warm slightly over a hot plate for a few seconds. evens out the oil
1652 2018-01-25 20:13:37 Not forgetting 'Oil On Canvas' too.
1653 2018-01-25 20:13:33 Another option would be to get some chicken breasts or pork cutlets. Pound them thin, season them w/salt & pepper, and saute in butter/olive oil. Take them out of the pan and keep warm. Throw 1/4 cup of sherry or marsala, a bit of butter, & some herbs into pan, reduce to sauce.
1654 2018-01-25 20:13:28 It makes me wonder if this is an award for the person who is best at squeezing oil out of olives, or if it's a look-a-like contest of Olive Oil from Popeye.

Practical, eat and crap at same time.
1659 2018-01-25 20:13:02 In the historical progress of Mankind, who is going to point out the use of coconut oil on the eyelashes?? #fatuousadverts
1660 2018-01-25 20:12:59 Also, the chicken salad is KOSHER! A lot of people mistaken mayo for a dairy product, but it's actually just oil, an acid agent (like lemon juice or vinegar) and eggs.
1661 2018-01-25 20:12:48 I had one big meal today (2 potatoes, 2 carrots, a pound of mushrooms and 2 beetroots + 1tbsp of oil) and it shut down my cravings for binging.
1662 2018-01-25 20:12:36 went home for lunch today and all i did was spill vegetable oil on myself
1663 2018-01-25 20:12:23 Rumsfeld memos on dominance of oil in US foreign policy thinking have Jeet Heer saying, "I told you so" to centrist pundits. Centrist pundits still have him on mute.

1666 2018-01-25 20:12:11 Natural oil’s are best for babies. olive, coconut, almond oil etc. But baby oil is good enough too.
1667 2018-01-25 20:11:40 Having that many oil containers frozen is a travesty. 
1668 2018-01-25 20:11:34 I recommend the light oil bevause this stuff gets everywhere!!!!!!

1673 2018-01-25 20:11:01 My Healing Oil Sprays are gender-neutral. They are not heavy oils and can be administered in the air or applied as topical use.
1674 2018-01-25 20:11:00 I make sure to pay my bills before I buy alcohol or oil that's for sure.
1675 2018-01-25 20:10:51 Lowest unemployment in 17 years
Black unemployment  lowest in 45 years.  Hispanic unemployment  lowest in 45 years. ISIS on the run.  Draining the swamp.  Best President since reagan.  I'm not in the oil business
1676 2018-01-25 20:10:48 Rats are good swimmers and too small to easily drown or shoot. But an extra human could come up with other strategies like dumping and igniting oil on the water to burn them as they come in. So in total I feel this is a solid choice in that location.
1677 2018-01-25 20:10:23 Coconut oil alll the way
1678 2018-01-25 20:10:20 Wow, @GOP really doesn't like American Citizens. How do we ignore this party so that we can get on with raising revenue, rebuilding our roads, bldgs,bridges, schools, and paying off our debt so we can be prosperous again. These guys are out to reduce our population to reserve oil
1679 2018-01-25 20:10:15 Tracking images of activity around an oil refinery can allow companies and commodity traders to predict the supply for oil or gas. And the new age of competitive analytics isn’t limited to satellite imagery. #GoogleEarth #SupplyChain

1682 2018-01-25 20:09:55 "Oh I see"

That's probably not something she can drink, it would taste more like drinking gas or oil, which would leave a bad taste in the mouth. 

"So what cause you to fall friend?"

She offered her hand to help him up.
1683 2018-01-25 20:09:53 yeah, that's actually the number one thing I cut out! I tried using oil AS moisturizer but that was too much. I should probably add some to a lotion when I finally find the right lotion.
1684 2018-01-25 20:09:51 Houston is a very transit town. The big three industries are oil, medical and NASA where people turnover about every 7 years and then move. This is why we have so many fans from other cities.
1685 2018-01-25 20:09:47 I don't understand.  If we can drill for oil in the ANWAR and pollute the water supply with mining byproducts, why can't Phillip Morris sell "safe" nicotine products?  Won't such products create many, many jobs?  Tremendous jobs?
1686 2018-01-25 20:09:33 Aye bud that's the stuff, depends what type you got whether you need CBD oil or THC oil. CBD helps with anxiety n that.
1687 2018-01-25 20:09:29 I would be part of a bigger opioid epidemic if I hadn't have been rescued by a true friend who told me about CBD oil! My Dr had me on everything from fentanyl patches to hydromorphone, to you name it! #happytobedrugfree #cbdoil #drsrdrugdealers #cleanandpainfree

1689 2018-01-25 20:09:21 Can anyone recommend me a good beard oil?
1690 2018-01-25 20:09:21 you need castor oil
1691 2018-01-25 20:09:17 Ah, true enough. Forgot about that. Though, again, Dennis is talking about halting all oil drilling, not just fracking, which is indeed nuts.
1692 2018-01-25 20:08:57 Motor oil?
1693 2018-01-25 20:08:39 Garnier Ultimate blends, the Shea and Avocado oil one is good for moisture for a LOC wash and go but for treatments look out for deep conditioner packets they usually cost around R15 - R30, a nice one is Dr Miracle tingling intensive d.c treatment with jojoba oil.

1695 2018-01-25 20:08:25 You're still defending Iraq? The Iraq War was more reactionary politics than Oil, but it's still not a reason to go to war.
1696 2018-01-25 20:08:10 Take some Fluffy nugs Bind said fluffy nugs to a chopstick with hemp line or thread wrap in parchment and put in fridge for a few days, then take out remove hemp line and coat buds with nice amount of hash, run your lighter over the bud lightly wrap with leaves using oil to bind.
1697 2018-01-25 20:07:58 Saudi should stop bombing Yemen and lift the blocked. Yemen is forbidden from exporting goods and oil. Manufacturing cycle is stopped due to the airstrikes and the blockade.

1699 2018-01-25 20:07:54 鶏肉のトマト煮込みとか……せめてトマトソースのハンバーグとかにしてくれればいいのになぜプチトマト添えるだけでいけると思ったのか
1700 2018-01-25 20:07:48 Sprinkle with oil and try 25 mins
1701 2018-01-25 20:07:46 Oil/ gas subsidies are killing Alaska; money goes out of state, not in our pockets. Our budget in crisis. This deference to Energy giants is hurting whole country.
1702 2018-01-25 20:07:43 Longs far outnumber shorts currently, $oil could pullback sharply, eg if an inventory rise occurs, there could be a rush for the exit.
1703 2018-01-25 20:07:40 If you can make fries yourself, fry them in peanut oil and eat them without any sauce, just salt.

Universe of a difference.

Still a subpar dish though LOL
1704 2018-01-25 20:07:22 Josie Moran Argan oil, leaves the skin so soft
1705 2018-01-25 20:07:16 Another oil like grapeseed oil or safflower oil , which are good for fighting acne/inflammation because they're high in linoleic acid
1706 2018-01-25 20:06:51 Well the Bullion Banks did and whomever stalled Oil at 66.66 did... Gold open interest jumped to ~600k contracts last night.

1708 2018-01-25 20:06:07 i use coconut oil and baking soda which could have old dinosaur bones in it but IDK for sure! 
1709 2018-01-25 20:05:23 Earlier when I went to get an oil change, I pulled up a coupon on my phone and as I turned it around, my finger swiped over and I ended up showing the guy a nude and he was like uhhhh I don’t think that’s what you’re trying to show me... still recovering from that hours later tbh
1710 2018-01-25 20:05:21 THE US SHOULD LEAVE TO PURCHASE PETROLEUM TO VENEZUELA. ALSO STOP PROVIDING TO PDVSA DERIVED FROM OIL. BETTER SANCTION THAN THE TAXES CURRENTLY.
1711 2018-01-25 20:05:19 Trump Administration uses “Trap Door” not Back Door Diplomacy. His America First policy is a hollow lie when he embraces #TPP so vividly.

1716 2018-01-25 20:05:03 No kopi luwak, nor goat argan oil stuff . The grandfather just liked the idea that while he was having an apperitif (after the harvest, the pressing and bottling), some of his cows were inebriated too

1722 2018-01-25 20:04:39 More of the problem is cost. How much it costs to be sick is over whelming. Add that with paying insurance, and still having a huge co-pay. Sicknesses is almost as profitable as oil, maybe even more so.  About 1/8 of my check goes to insurance, and I still have to pay 30-200 more
1723 2018-01-25 20:04:38 Brakes and rotors changed, oil changed, now just need to get a inspection and renew my registration and no more looking over my shoulder every time I drive

1728 2018-01-25 20:04:06 Got to put together, oil and fuel up the snowblower today (got it last night). Runs great and handles the 0.5 inch of snow I had on my driveway well lol. Can't wait for more snow to put it to the test.

Best part is it's easy to move and no stress on my back. Woo!
1729 2018-01-25 20:04:05 @UltraHealthMC do you have any leads on wholesale cbd oil suppliers?
1730 2018-01-25 20:03:31 A simple word of commendation for the growth in GDP in d midst of low oil prices would not remove a pint of blood from you sir. Lest you forgot, continuous GDP growth will eventually be felt in people’s lives #Slow&Steady
1731 2018-01-25 20:03:26 Saginaw. Major Accident/Road Hazard. 500 North Saginaw Blvd.  Roadway is shut down due to a large amount of cooking oil spilled in roadway. Several vehicles spun out including one MC/Scooter.
1732 2018-01-25 20:03:23 Truth.   

Without bigotry, ignorance, cray-cray and gerrymandering, today's GOP really has nothing for most Americans.   Just tax cuts for billionaires and the gutting of regs for Wall St and Big Oil.
1733 2018-01-25 20:03:15 No it’s a roller, it has essential oils diluted win coconut oil in it
1734 2018-01-25 20:03:09 Never had hot olive oil splash into my mouth till today ouch!!
1735 2018-01-25 20:03:05 It goes to subsidies to big oil, Military Industrial Complex, Congressional perks and healthcare. If you are poor you get a refund or if you are GE and Boeing you don't pay taxes. I looked at your profile. Go listen to more Limbaugh and his ilk and watch Hannity. It's capitalism.
1736 2018-01-25 20:03:01 Just bc I'm from Houston don't mean I know where the oil at  y'all the laws
1737 2018-01-25 20:02:57 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.

1740 2018-01-25 20:02:31 All professIONs are controlled by the iam. That is why much of what they do is snake oil. Not meaning to demean those who really try to help though.
1741 2018-01-25 20:02:30 I love this stuff, I also give my dogs 1 tablespoon each/day of coconut oil (I get mine at Safeway) they love it and it’s great for dry skin
1742 2018-01-25 20:02:26 No wonder this multinational oil companies have never thought of fixing our roads despite price fixing and minting billions from our shithole country
1743 2018-01-25 20:02:22 Best oil!
1744 2018-01-25 20:02:22 The other issue is just that people get pizza and eat only pizza, which isn't a complete meal. If you have pizza without bromated flour or hydrogenated vegetable oil, and it's not burnt, and you have some vegetables on the side, it's pretty much fine.
1745 2018-01-25 20:02:18 got my handicapped sticker from the dmv, oil changed in car, went tanning, got my eyebrows and a brazilian done, got my car washed, and about to pick up take out chinese I AM THRIVING BEFORE 1PM BITCH
1746 2018-01-25 20:02:18 you seen sentiment and positioning in oil, gold, dollar? Everyone absolutely loaded up long commodities, short DXY long EUR
1747 2018-01-25 20:02:12 Did you also explain that coal and oil companies are free to pollute our streams and rivers again?
1748 2018-01-25 20:02:09 Would it be safe to say that all those who support going after the oil companies on this issue have stopped buying fuel?
1749 2018-01-25 20:02:07 Wen there's no beans at home and all you have left was red oil.
1750 2018-01-25 20:02:01 And by "people", he means big oil and mining companies.

1757 2018-01-25 20:01:14 I'll definitely consider it! One of the biggest fragrance oil suppliers had a giant warehouse fire in December so I'm kinda running on what I have left for right now

1763 2018-01-25 20:00:55 I prefer olive oil for stir frying veg - butter turns veg into bubble & squeak! Lard would be better for chips, but I don't tend to eat these (unless in Caroline Street - it's a Welsh thing!)

1832 2018-01-25 19:54:00 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
1833 2018-01-25 19:53:58 I could imagine if That was JJ plush tie down and oil up that would be one hell of a dinner.

1835 2018-01-25 19:53:51 My bf walks up to me and feeds me a spoonful of oil for our oil pulling every single morning  thanks for lookin out babe
1836 2018-01-25 19:53:39 And the Russians were never even involved at all were they? They didn’t flatten every single ISIS stronghold in Syria . They definitely didn’t expose ISIS oil trucks being welcomed over the Turkish border. No the Russians are just a myth aren’t they? 
1837 2018-01-25 19:53:24 Ahhhreadyy bout to get upget my oil changed n shit..been sleep all day
1838 2018-01-25 19:53:20 You don't think it's a coincidence that whenever a country begins to assert it's autonomy, and that of its oil (eg, Graddafi, Mossadegh, etc) that all of the sudden the US starts to care about their people?
1839 2018-01-25 19:52:57 @TroyBrouwer36 @NHLFlames score one against the oil for me bud #Flames1stGoal
1840 2018-01-25 19:52:54 Today, the crude oil price jumped to 80$ per barrel. Remember it and keep it in your memory. They will account for their steward at the end of 2019 .
1841 2018-01-25 19:52:50 Rudi how many big dollar oil Barron’s are going to allow us to start building more electric cars? If it was going to happen I think we would have already been there. Car manufactures oil, gas.. to much money going to pockets of to many career piliticians!! I’m for it. But won’t
1842 2018-01-25 19:52:34 I just love getting car oil in my hair 
1843 2018-01-25 19:52:33 Today I need to look after myself a bit. Doing all the things that make me right, including a face mask, @LushLtd bath oil, cooking pumpkin and goat's cheese risotto and watching disturbing documentaries. #selfcare #youdoyou
1844 2018-01-25 19:52:30 I guess the higher price normally is the installation fee. Kind of like getting an oil change.
1845 2018-01-25 19:52:24 Am I the only one who puts baby oil on my body after I shower ?

1851 2018-01-25 19:51:44 I’ve been trying different pancake and waffle mixes to get a sense of what’s out there. Such a span of what wet ingredients you have to provide. Every possible combination of egg, milk, water, and oil. The water-only ones scare me.
1852 2018-01-25 19:51:41 We feed our dogs coconut oil mixed with their dog food and it helps!

1854 2018-01-25 19:51:26 Sorry I’m clueless, what is castor oil and should I be using it if I have almost no eyelashes? 
1855 2018-01-25 19:51:22 Not I, I let it warm up and while it’s warming I check the oil and antifreeze pour water on the car by the time I’m done it’s warm enough to pull off
1856 2018-01-25 19:51:20 I'm so tired, just waiting for class to end so that I can go do an oil change before Disney
1857 2018-01-25 19:51:18 While waiting to get an oil change, a little girl with space buns was sitting next to me and I looked at her dad and said “she is so cute!” Without hesitation he replied “Thanks, she got it from her momma”

1862 2018-01-25 19:50:56 Dude, you just need to know how to cook them. Cut them in half, season them with salt and pepper and olive oil, and bake them at 400 degrees for 40 min, stirring halfway through. So good.
1863 2018-01-25 19:50:51 I’m sitting with baby getting him a oil change and it’s taking foreverrr.

1877 2018-01-25 19:49:34 Why was I paying for my oil change and he threw up all over me 
1878 2018-01-25 19:49:29 just got back from getting an oil change. the cashier at the counter had a low cut shirt on, the owner was their and I asked him to have his employees put a descent shirt on. 95% that work there are men. dress modestly women and men will look at you respectfully.

1891 2018-01-25 19:47:59 Wtf are you talking? He can do whatever he wants to his brother. The reason his brother came to work with him shows his brother accepted. They knows each other better than you and I. Stop pouring more oil to our current situation.
1892 2018-01-25 19:47:58 Forget the chocolate, found some reduced chicken and bacon caesar salads. 28.6 C per pack: 5.6 sugar, 3.4 fibre. That should get me feeling a little perkier later tonight. Going to smother it in olive oil and a pack of roast chicken breast.

1895 2018-01-25 19:47:13 Yeah, nothing like being interview by completely undeniable idiots to help give the Department of the Interior even LESS credibility than your appointment to lead it did. So just how much in bribes from the oil industry have you received so far?
1896 2018-01-25 19:47:10 I've noticed they really help even out texture & any hyperpigmentation, I use 100% with hazel for my toner mixed with a little rose oil and it's perfect for scarring! I think it just helps even everything out & is super refreshing
1897 2018-01-25 19:47:06 YEAH that’s why salt sugar and soy and oil are in so much and no one cares and doesn’t want to take the time to READ YA LABELS  they’re all heavily subsidized too but I won’t get into the conspiracy rn

1900 2018-01-25 19:46:26 we've been preparing for the xfer from oil/gas to green for years, he does supervision of inspection, he has dozens of options once pipelines are no longer built and no longer needing inspected.
1901 2018-01-25 19:46:20 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*

1904 2018-01-25 19:45:23 Enough oil to last all night (they had some in their lamps, since their lamps were going out around midnight.) The question is, why?
1905 2018-01-25 19:45:14 The markets keep breaking records because of the GREED of UNREGULATED WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS. They also control the CCM and unless REGULATED they may break the record for GAS/HEATING OIL at the CCM. Rocket science it ain't. Your responsibility it is.
1906 2018-01-25 19:45:10 shoutout to @SilencedHippie for the coconut oil as makeup remover tip  that shit is brilliant
1907 2018-01-25 19:45:03 Oh so much wonder if the OIL deal went down.
1908 2018-01-25 19:44:59 I am absolutely bored out my mind! I guess in about an hour I can drop my car off for an oil change tomorrow and just ride my mountain bike home it’s 35 out but could be worse and it’s only like 8 miles or so I think. Then off to gym again.

1910 2018-01-25 19:44:37 They also contain palm oil, which is one of the main deforestation causes in Indonesia and is not a sustainable product!
1911 2018-01-25 19:44:35 They're amazing! No oil required! No fridge required!
1912 2018-01-25 19:44:32 Actually, the way to do that with solar has passed us by years ago now. Supporting solar would have helped. Don't subsidize big oil, would have helped. Not demonizing the government over a failed solar company, remember Solyndra? But now we have a vibrant installation industry.

1916 2018-01-25 19:43:54 You can tell the price of oil is better. A cake a week here courtesy of our various NOLA outside law firms.  I burned out on them ten years ago because of that. But we are on the same floor as the IT Dept so the hyenas descend as soon as the lid is opened. 
1917 2018-01-25 19:43:52 Saudi looking for some headlines.

Oil is down
1918 2018-01-25 19:43:49 Like we give a shit. Regardless of what got the likes of Pogba and Sanchez to Utd they’re still there. Yaya probably hadn’t heard of City until the oil money came along.
1919 2018-01-25 19:43:42 Lol you reminded me of our own maid/cook back home in Lahore. She used to massage my head every single day, oil my hair, put rose water, and comb too. Hah. Rub yourself against the wall loll. Might help.
1920 2018-01-25 19:43:23 “Would you like something to drink while you wait on your oil change?” 
Yea, I’ll take a Budweiser. 
1921 2018-01-25 19:43:15 .@OKPolicy oil prices are rising abt $10/brl per month. With oil likely back to $100/brl later this year what will that mean to Oklahoma revenue? #okbudget18

1928 2018-01-25 19:42:37 For soft hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1929 2018-01-25 19:42:31 What is the purpose for doing an oil change in your car?
1930 2018-01-25 19:42:10 Oil of cloves is meant to be great for rubbing on your gums.
1931 2018-01-25 19:42:04 Delighted to note @Tesco appears to have enlarged its range of olive oil sold in glass bottles. Plastic is not only more environmentally unfriendly, it's an unhealthy option if the oil is stored anywhere near direct sunlight.

1933 2018-01-25 19:41:55 Where is the health and safety issue for other tenants from a joint being smoked in a separate unit? Is the landlord banning cooking with peanut oil because their HVAC is venting those fumes to other units or common areas as well or are they screening and disclosing to newcomer?

1965 2018-01-25 19:39:22 Oil drilling - which has occurred in this state for more than 100 years - is not causing “earthquakes and flaming water.” Neither is fracking, for that matter, but even the conspiracy theorists don’t blame oil drilling.
1966 2018-01-25 19:39:20 Castor oil is great. It’s all natural and promotes growth and strength.
1967 2018-01-25 19:39:14 That’s impressively shit. Mine was a tiny jar of chilli oil. Could have got about 50 in the first box, 15 in the second.

1969 2018-01-25 19:39:05 You man need to stop seeing taxation as the devil. If u don’t wanna pay tax peep how a fleet of countries that aren’t oil stated manage.
1970 2018-01-25 19:39:05 cop oregano oil thank me later
1971 2018-01-25 19:38:54 Career-obsessed lying snake oil salesman is a much more respectable path.
1972 2018-01-25 19:38:52 They should be the first to drink the contaminated ground water.

Trading clean ground water for oil.
1973 2018-01-25 19:38:47 Classic question. To Nation build or not? 
Bovine head nodders all crying DO SOMETHING! OK, exactly how do you force them WHILE sending aid?
1974 2018-01-25 19:38:38 Ladies , shave your vagina with baby oil gel or coconut oil  it won't be bumpy nor stale or dry , it'll be really pretty & healthy! shit do miracles! thank me later 
1975 2018-01-25 19:38:33 So I got my air fry and I am suitably impressed - it DOES crunch things up without oil - I tried it on some mac and cheetos
1976 2018-01-25 19:38:29 thx to my broes 4 letting me oil em up and capturing em in various rock poses
1977 2018-01-25 19:38:24 I feel coconut oil is severely overrated and hemp seed oil is severely underrated
1978 2018-01-25 19:38:12 fear and mistrust the tools of the GOP and then a war we can't win over  OIL
1979 2018-01-25 19:38:07 Skin care ; Grapeseed oil , avocado oil , & Raw Shea butter

1982 2018-01-25 19:37:45 I'm so glad mama getting me some coconut oil so I can shaveeeee
1983 2018-01-25 19:37:44 Happy birthday man of God, the oil of anointing shall never dry on you. Reign more @pauladefarasin
1984 2018-01-25 19:37:28 As long as she can check her own oil, guys gonna nut on her
1985 2018-01-25 19:37:06 Those who invest know what an #ICO can do to a companies share price.... We also know #oil is hot this year. Put both of those together and you have a company called $HRH #DYODD
1986 2018-01-25 19:36:51 LOL - what a day! it was only the second greatest spillage at BANG though, after one of the german desk dropped some olive oil and without missing a beat @PhilipHamilton_ exclaimed "quick - get some bread!"
1987 2018-01-25 19:36:49 Heat it in a pan half full of water for 2-4 minutes then rinse out the water and add to a frying pan filled with oil, a pinch of salt and liquid nitrogen for 54 minutes on medium heat
1988 2018-01-25 19:36:44 I think GST and Demo is not a big deal for people but apart from all this nothing happened on ground level for ppl.
In International markets oil prize get down even then gov hold it on same rate why this BJP guys r not in mood of giving relief to people.
1989 2018-01-25 19:36:35 If they get paid (or raise union money) from oil business/projects, then yes imo.
1990 2018-01-25 19:36:24 Got everything off my checklist today. Now waiting for my car oil to be changed
1991 2018-01-25 19:36:19 Indeed.

1993 2018-01-25 19:36:19 Baffled by the No Oil method in piece. Hot oil coats, and conducts heat to every surface of the onion, so surely dry-frying slows it down even more?
1994 2018-01-25 19:36:17 Falwell and his ilk are charlatans, con men and swindlers.  Modern day snake oil salesmen. “There’s a sucker born every day “ is the life’s blood of TV preachers.
1995 2018-01-25 19:36:10 Remind him that checked baggage fees were added "temporarily" to offset costs when oil prices were $100.  Fees remained even when oil prices dropped.  AAL will survive with current prices.
1996 2018-01-25 19:35:57 Tidak bisa mengingat apa sudah minum fish oil atau belum :(
1997 2018-01-25 19:35:48 Pretty much old news. No bashing here, just well known we turn blind eye to "cultural" differences so not to upset the locals. Non diversity
1998 2018-01-25 19:35:35 It was incredible Leslie. It was in this very old palazzo with two story oil paintings from the 1500s on the wall. Then all these rare, beautiful fragrance bottles. Amazing
1999 2018-01-25 19:35:33 I got peppermint essential oil in my eye and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy
2000 2018-01-25 19:35:26 Time to sit back and watch the most crowded trades, short dollar, long gold, long oil all unwind. Could last awhile.
2001 2018-01-25 19:35:22 Noodles that is actually fried. Cook it, just before it gets too soft, drain the water and use a little oil to finish it. Best to add the noodles to stir fry.

2010 2018-01-25 19:34:32  yes there is. I hear there's many types but I only give recipes for what I've tried. 6 egg yolks, 2 whole eggs mixed with 43g of olive oil. Then add 256g almond flour(if you don't have just throw some almonds in a coffee grinder or blender till powdery, sieve)
2011 2018-01-25 19:34:26 @HughHarrop Good evening Hugh, thank you for your 'follow'.  I'm just about to start a large oil painting of a Black Kite (a commission) and look forward to reading your tweets as I work :-)  Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead, best wishes Kerry xXx

2034 2018-01-25 19:29:57 $XOP EURO just rolled over and took oil with it, as well as taking oil stocks to new lows for the day. $SPY somehow still holding green for the day, but if that rolls over too, then this could get really ugly for oil stocks.

2044 2018-01-25 19:28:04 Gatta love a free car wash with an oil change
2045 2018-01-25 19:28:04 Getting the oil changed on my car. Going to walk to a couple of nearby mattress stores. Once my auto accident check comes in I’m going to buy me a new mattress for the first time in my life.
2046 2018-01-25 19:28:03 Thank you @Toyota for free car washes, multi-point inspections, oil changes, tire rotations, and liquid adjustments on my leased vehicle. Love the benefits! (Did I mention free?)
2047 2018-01-25 19:28:02 Literally the best/only thing that’s ever consistently worked for me is coconut oil &sugar mixed together. I added a few drops lavender essential oil for smell but don’t have to! Even good for your lips! Use as a scrub in the shower!
2048 2018-01-25 19:27:56 Did y'all hear that? The dealer wants me to accept a car was driven w/ no oil b/c the drain plug fell the 'f' out. I only asked for their best warranty for peace of mind. They said no. Most people would probably ask for a new car.
2049 2018-01-25 19:27:54 We oil the jaw of the war machine and feed it with our babies!

You are just a snake oil salesman.

2057 2018-01-25 19:26:50 the cedar infused olive oil I’ve put near the burner so it heats every time we cook smells amazing on my pulse points.

2059 2018-01-25 19:26:32 Doesn’t being part of OPEC mean that there’s a cap to the amount of oil we are allowed to produce? To keep the prices high...
2060 2018-01-25 19:26:29 How do you like to cook your eggs? I normally like to cook mine in a skillet with hot olive oil with some shredded cheese.
2061 2018-01-25 19:26:23 Exactly. Painting or writing poetry may be a passion and still not pay the bills.
2062 2018-01-25 19:26:22 I used to be a huge recyler until my home waste hauler told us “no more glass” - Really?  So you want more plastic? The world really needs more plastic! What’s up with the no recycling of glass?  Beer, sauces, foods, OJ, etc -
Glass: sand/silica  Plastic: oil
2063 2018-01-25 19:26:06 Remember to add CBD oil to the list. 
2064 2018-01-25 19:26:04 Exactly how I felt while she threw her #PrivilegedTantrum. I told her to cut the pot and use capsaicin cream. She asked if it was a CBD oil.

2068 2018-01-25 19:25:27 It is illegal in Colorado to manufacture butane hash oil at home due to the highly unstable chemicals used in the process
2069 2018-01-25 19:25:27 They just soak up oil like sponges and get all gross like a worm
2070 2018-01-25 19:25:23 Alcohol or oil of cloves sounds best
2071 2018-01-25 19:25:13 Ok, so you guys just took my complaint but said it's up to the dealer to handle it. The dealer told me they would honor the basic warranty (4 yrs/50k miles). They actually said that was nice of them b/c BMW the corporation might not honor it since it was driven w/ no oil. WOW!
2072 2018-01-25 19:25:00 coconut oil got my hair soooo soft

2089 2018-01-25 19:22:40 My roommate just accidentally fried our microwave while making popcorn...

I make popcorn on the stove top instead using coconut oil and pink salt and it's really good.
I should make stove top more often. Well, I guess I'll have to...
2090 2018-01-25 19:22:27 Whilst it is great to highlight the #palmoil that is in (a LOT of) products so that people can make the better #palmoilfree choice (for the sake of the #orangutans and other wildlife that live in the #rainforests) , I often wonder what oil ‘Chippies’ use ..probably more often..
2091 2018-01-25 19:22:10 I just went into advance auto to get oil for my car and when dude told me the total I said I needed to run out to the car to get some more money so instead he just changed the price and made it hella cheap 
2092 2018-01-25 19:22:08 The other day I made pasta and then just put butter and olive oil on it. You could say I’m a real Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen.

2111 2018-01-25 19:19:26 @SiriusXMFantasy @Jeff_Mans @BaseballGuys I’m really holding out for PBA being picked up as a new DFS sport, since it is picking up in popularity. If that happens, I’d be ready to jump right in and write DFS for it. I’ve started to take notes on bowlers and different oil patterns

2114 2018-01-25 19:19:10 Coconut oil
2115 2018-01-25 19:19:09 $ALK bought some. p/e cheap.  Hit bottom support.  Has Virgin America on its side.  Only thing I can see derailing this is oil prices skyrocketing.
2116 2018-01-25 19:18:57 That’s was a good debate indeed Don. I watch a lot of Premier League footy where managers are given great praise when they can motivate to change a teams disposition and dismissed very quickly when they fail... Dismissing coaching responsibility with Oil right now is naive.
2117 2018-01-25 19:18:51 @kumailn, I have a brussels sprouts recipe you should try.

Toss 15oz brussels sprouts in a bowl with 3T olive oil, 1/2 tsp sea salt, and pepper to taste. Bake at 350 for 35 minutes. Remove and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Throw directly in the trash and order takeout.
2118 2018-01-25 19:18:40 I’ve tried so many conditioners & the only kind that’ll work for my hair is is the olive oil Olive Cholesterol. Everything else dries it up

2120 2018-01-25 19:18:27 I need some lavender oil.
2121 2018-01-25 19:18:25 RT "

So $FROT is an oil and gas tech company (hot area) looking to start into blockchain (even hotter area) with a low float, good looking website, and news? Did i catch all that correctly? Sounds like a gold mine $srmx, $ifxy, $potn,$ntfl, $segi, $andi, $digaf, $pdxp, $dna…
2122 2018-01-25 19:18:16 If each piece of chicken including seasonings , flour and fryer oil is a $1.  That’s $10 by itself.  

If biscuits are made with butter they will 
$.16each 

Unless they sale in super high volume, cost it is.
2123 2018-01-25 19:17:53 #ukog Yes, I am aware of near by oil wells but, surprisingly not actually researched them. But, as you say, producing which is the key thing. It's inconceivable to me that #BroadfordBridge won't flow commercially.
2124 2018-01-25 19:17:53 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,

2131 2018-01-25 19:16:55 @JeffreeStar sitting waiting on my oil change and the receptionist called me over to ask who I was wearing on my lips and I explained how you’re the only liquid lip I trust and sold her on it. I always get compliments with #JeffreeStarCosmetics  #jeffreestar
2132 2018-01-25 19:16:30 Go for full unrefined coconut oil instead of MCT. Taste is better and it is better for you :-)
2133 2018-01-25 19:16:21 I have a dream  its the oil companies NOT SCREWING AMERICANS on the price of a gallon of GAS
2134 2018-01-25 19:16:20 Some can be rehabed some not. Mostly just warehousing of ppl. TV, rec areas no substitute for job training. Trades easily taught here.
2135 2018-01-25 19:16:09 Lmao sorry!  I'm sure you'll be fine I wasn't using my bio oil all the time! 
2136 2018-01-25 19:15:55 From your own source "The catch is that Bonds’ personal trainer misled him into believing he was taking flax seed oil and arthritis cream." And show me the positive test via MLB.
2137 2018-01-25 19:15:55 no wonder they burned the oil to protest his coming
2138 2018-01-25 19:15:53 Have you ever tried using aloe Vera on your skin? It helps to rebalance the skins oil production and can reduce oiliness
2139 2018-01-25 19:15:53 LW: I dunno. Here in Alabama we actually rely on oil spill settlements to plug recurring budget holes. Were probably cool with it.
2140 2018-01-25 19:15:46 Spent the day with physical oil traders in Rotterdam & Amsterdam, hardly anyone buying hedge funds driven long calls on oil out of #Davos as Brent nears $71/bbl; long term bearish sentiment still valid #OOTT #oilandgas
2141 2018-01-25 19:15:44 look at how quicky things turned on gold/oil on that news. Knee jerk reactions to the jerks comment.
2142 2018-01-25 19:15:30 I would so bring you soup hot tea and good lavender/ chamomile oil for a hot bath if i could q.q
2143 2018-01-25 19:15:30 Just gave my other girlfriend an oil change and she’s purring so nicely now. It’s gunna be a great day!

2145 2018-01-25 19:15:04 Definitely, it reduces the oil for a while and also makes me feel comfortable. When my skin is super oily it gets very hot & uncomfortable.
2146 2018-01-25 19:15:00 This was an unlicensed grow.  Deputies seized appx 2-3 lbs of highly concentrated "shatter" butane hash oil extraction

2148 2018-01-25 19:14:46 Get some almond oil and use it for awhile. If your skin is inflamed or irritated use aloe oil too
2149 2018-01-25 19:14:40 Perry framed exports of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal as a central part of President Trump's "Energy Dominance" agenda, in which the administration is aiming to dramatically increase the domestic production of fossil fuels.
2150 2018-01-25 19:14:31 Olive oil???
2151 2018-01-25 19:14:27 Kurdish territory has 50% of Syrian oil resources. It is water rich with a key dam. It has among the best agricultural land in #Syria. The US by denying this to #Assad would hinder Syria's recovery. Israel/SA would like this.
2152 2018-01-25 19:14:21 I no longer need anxiety or depression meds thanks to hemp oil.
2153 2018-01-25 19:14:18 due to hiking oil prices. it is a global scare.
2154 2018-01-25 19:13:54 My god Chelsea were crap before the oil money

2156 2018-01-25 19:13:52 I really dislike Tyrell’s am afraid - not a fan of the oil or potatoes they use
2157 2018-01-25 19:13:41 What a revelation! The #StableGenius thinks this bodes well for coal and oil, of course. #Loyalists appeased while the greater good of the 99% & the environment suffer.
2158 2018-01-25 19:13:37 There was a propane and oil truck standing outside my house. Don't forget why Hank is so nice now. 

White peopleeee
2159 2018-01-25 19:13:27 I know that presidents don’t control gas prices. But with this admin (per Mnuchen yesterday) praising weaker dollar (at least he said it, now walking back) and oil priced in dollars (upward pressure), is it safe to say the trajectory is upward trend locking in? $3 gas soon?
2160 2018-01-25 19:13:25 LG already announced their price hike. 

I know he picked solar panels because his money's in oil. But why washing machines?  Why not dishwashers? Ovens? #RandomMadness
2161 2018-01-25 19:13:18 @NeckVG if you don’t get an oil change
2162 2018-01-25 19:13:13 Natural solution my family taught me that is weird but works: lavender oil on the bottom of your feet when you go to bed. Works with eucalyptus oil too, if you want to clear your sinuses.

2164 2018-01-25 19:13:10 Guten tag, it's Olive Oil. Somebody's been wondering if after all these days you'd like to weep.

2168 2018-01-25 19:12:21 He hadn’t even read it and wouldn’t be able to understand global finance. He got rich by not paying contractors, banks ect. He’s a snake oil salesman at best.
2169 2018-01-25 19:12:11 i swear to god if one more person tells me i can cure my cystic acne with coconut oil and drinking water i’m going to end it all
2170 2018-01-25 19:12:02 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
2171 2018-01-25 19:11:53 NEVER forget that Henry Kissinger went to the Arab countries, when they were floundering without funds, and told them they were sitting on a gold mine (OIL) and they needed to start charging huge sums for that natural resource.  OUR Leaders ... never fail to cut our throats.
2172 2018-01-25 19:11:32 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

2177 2018-01-25 19:10:53 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
2178 2018-01-25 19:10:41 No, just a good time to play CB mouth game and get a reaaction given how far down it was.  He's learned well.  Plus, oil should yank for a while.

2180 2018-01-25 19:10:34 i dont think i’d ever be ready for a ponytail, one side of my head has severe hair loss. hopefully castor oil and some tlc will remedy this?

2183 2018-01-25 19:10:17 Remember in 90's Barbara Walters story on prisons providing education. Big uproar over it. Result was reduction in Pell grants, job training
2184 2018-01-25 19:10:11 Gas station attendant...back when there was still full serve and we actually had to check oil, wash windows, etc.
2185 2018-01-25 19:10:08 Then the Lord was jealous for his land
and took pity on his people.

The Lord replied to them:

2186 2018-01-25 19:10:02 Seems like the oil & coal lobbyist won
2187 2018-01-25 19:09:54 Thank God for the exchange of your weakness for His strength. Thank Him for unusual wisdom, insight and revelation, for health instead of disease, for an abundance of grace, and fresh oil from the Holy Spirit #WorshipExperience #Stronger #TECMainland

2190 2018-01-25 19:09:49 In Ug, the price of oil is already up.
2191 2018-01-25 19:09:49 whenever the books point out that luck is supposedly "not cut out for the mafia" even tho he literally stabbed a man in the neck with his own severed hand and cemented dallas into an oil drum then dropped his ass into the hudson river.... my man is a professional....
2192 2018-01-25 19:09:44 You dummy, most solar panels are imported. This is just Drumpf throwing money to big oil by trying to kill solar power.

2195 2018-01-25 19:09:20 You burnt your midnight oil in protecting paedophiles and rapist. My conviction has strengthened that your time is up! Your crimes have finally caught up with you! I pray that I witness the Sharifs severely punished in my lifetime.

2207 2018-01-25 19:06:34 I tell you the truth my brothers and sisters came to me like David when he dwelt in caves, but we were loyal to the oil through all temptations and spiritual warfare and our souls now eternally possess Jerusalem! Those who’ve fought along side me will be kings forever!
2208 2018-01-25 19:06:20 And you know I backed up Obama for almost 8 years hoping that he would do the right thing and of course that never happened Trump's already done more good in one year than Obama did in 8 remember how everybody blames Obama for the Oil Well in the gulf and everything else

2220 2018-01-25 19:05:15 Superstore a well.  Although there was no oat blend in the store I was in (arguably this should be oat canola because it has a lot of added oil).  I've actually seen quinoa or flax milk products at Dollarama.

2236 2018-01-25 19:03:22 I used Asian seasoning. But then I got a bag of cooked shrimp, thawed it, put it in a pan with garlic, peppers, and olive oil added pepper & some Asian seasoning then I put it in a bowl with the rice, avocado, shredded carrots, cucumber, and edamame add soy sauce and it’s

2251 2018-01-25 19:02:18 If you have OGX in your stores, I use the Argan Oil conditioner and hair butter. It's a blue bottle with a gold top.

2256 2018-01-25 19:01:45 that figure includes our exports that leave English ports and airports ... Tories twisting the figures again to suit own agenda like oil and gas coming from a "Unknown Region" #indyref2 #scotref

2259 2018-01-25 19:01:26 Just in general. He's OK. Moderate Democrat that leans left a lot of time and occasionally pisses of environmentalists. He's not anti oil and gas development. You can say both sides aren't impressed. He's like an Obama Democrat.
2260 2018-01-25 19:01:22 taking my car to get an oil change tomorrow instead of doing it myself makes me so mad bc I really wanna save that money lmao 
2261 2018-01-25 19:01:16 Hi. I bought some oil last year at Mold Food Festival and was chatting to the chap about bringing some bees down to the rape. Is this something you would be interested in @LlyrDerwydd? I'm based in Nercwys.
2262 2018-01-25 19:01:14 When was the last time you checked your oil? Remember to check your car's oil levels often, add oil if it's low, and always check for leaks!
2263 2018-01-25 19:01:10 Try castor oil, hair oil, however the crime.
2264 2018-01-25 19:01:09 oil came buy so now i can get FOOOOOD
2265 2018-01-25 19:01:07 Kick in some of that donor money you are stuffing in you pocket from oil, gas companies, and mining companies. Buy lot of housing and food. If gonna destroy your state lands may as well use them $'s for Alaskans not you personal account.
2266 2018-01-25 19:01:06 Essentially, using caps lock for emphasis mid-sentence produces an effect like an old-fashioned carnival barker or a snake oil salesman's handbill. 

You really have to give more thought to the medium, venue, and genre of writing to determine what is most appropriate.
2267 2018-01-25 19:01:00 i need to get my oil changed but i’m sitting here, alone, in silence, tweeting about star wars
2268 2018-01-25 19:00:59 Come on Democrats start fighting for people and our environment- Opioid addiction, DACA, pensions, less oil dependent, etc. etc.

2270 2018-01-25 19:00:52 President Barrow says there's every indication of oil deposits. Companies given up to June this year for more concrete answers #Gambia
2271 2018-01-25 19:00:48 Was in TX in late 80's gas was .25 cents a gallon came back to IL was .60 cents a gallon and gas lines. OIL is the law of the land and they beat everything if we let them.
2272 2018-01-25 19:00:42 I need to get my hands on that sunflower oil!!

2274 2018-01-25 19:00:34 Brilliant news - Indonesian entrepreneurs are making plastic bags out of cassava starch, vegetable oil, and organic resins. The resulting material was biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea, or instantly in hot water.
2275 2018-01-25 19:00:29 Nope, just a fan of men slathered in baby oil.

2283 2018-01-25 18:59:33 There will be no movement on opioid addiction because big pharma sells these killers to Drs who in turn sell them to the people. Just like they’re destroying solar to feed the oil & coal industry, we are screwed by big money donors.
2284 2018-01-25 18:59:29 Garbage, oil, teeth and bodies

2289 2018-01-25 18:58:39 We know that your admin allowed Russia to have influence in our country on MANY fronts and invited it. There is also documentation and action everywhere that supports it. Minerals, oil, infrastructure and total control hmm.

All are pleased w/new tax laws! 15 leaders at the table in Dovos! Impressive comments from each!
2292 2018-01-25 18:58:06 Take the money and run. 4 properties he leases to oil, father in law, lawyer to oil industry, $500,000 from the KOCH brothers, after the completion of tax plan. Now, he can stick pins in voodoo dolls of sick children, elders, deprived school lunches for a start.

2299 2018-01-25 18:56:57 Ahh!! I see paint mixing with glass mullers usually but I guess it's mostly for oil paints then. But I have seen finer holo powder but they're only for rubbing on gel coats
2300 2018-01-25 18:56:56 fracktivists should write a "mainstream media guide to oil & gas reporting"...

2302 2018-01-25 18:56:36 Coal, right, Senator? And oil? The future for a smog choked, lung diseased America! To hell with clean solar!  #MAGA - not.
2303 2018-01-25 18:56:24 that apple cider vinegar & black seed oil might’ve did something.
2304 2018-01-25 18:56:20 pres trump is right--we must be oil n energy-independent country at all times. we cant rely on foreign oil, which negatively affect our foreign policies. middle east countries n others can have their oil n...do whatever they please with it.
2305 2018-01-25 18:56:12 And Venezuela actually had a high HDI relative to Latin America for a time too, it's just it got corrupt and oil prices plummeted.

2310 2018-01-25 18:55:21 The noisy cog gets the most oil..  I guess  it's that old line .. there is no such thing as bad publicity...

2314 2018-01-25 18:54:32 Yeah, I see what you mean, and the quiz photo isn't the best example of the difference. Also, "oil slicks in a parking lot" is a great description of grackle plumage.

2392 2018-01-25 18:53:57 I really love to give my skin a gentle effect of moisture at evening by applying organic coconut oil and some aloe vera soothing gel. You acquire two things, affectionate odour, a good skin and to me this is basically what i need to boost my happiness.
2393 2018-01-25 18:53:54 Yerrr with ya'll?? Never!! I'd rather drink castor oil before living with you guys 
2394 2018-01-25 18:53:47 Lmfao yea, all of 'em aren't hittin like that but rosemary and olive oil is solid.
2395 2018-01-25 18:53:47 hey, I live just a few miles from Mesa Verde, and I fully expect corrupt, idiot, scumbag trump to have his rich pals putting up oil/gas derricks and start hydraulic mining in Meas Verde before his second year is up !!! Power to ALL the people, not just the rich ones !!
2396 2018-01-25 18:53:06 Spilled lavender oil on my sweatshirt, now I smell like Mr. Clean multipurpose cleaner ... I kind of like it actually.
2397 2018-01-25 18:52:50 This sounds interesting. By any chance have you been given info about the castor oil itself, ie was it tested on animals? And it can be a skin irritant for some skin types.
2398 2018-01-25 18:52:46 Dreamt I stumbled into a Brazilian bikini wax tent event outside where the girls were scissoring in tubs of mineral oil & the weatherman from the local station had a  was giving play by play updates about the scissoring + kept saying the humidity was 85% #weirddreams
2399 2018-01-25 18:52:43 Use aloe gel if your edges are ripping out, use it as a primer if your skin needs oil balancing, use it on your scalp after you got braids or cornrows to reduce soreness, use it on your chest when a nigga break your heart
2400 2018-01-25 18:52:28 You got a factory ready to produce solar panels out the door tomorrow? If not, you should really educate yourself. #PresidentBoneSpurs’ people did this FOR oil & gas, not for the American people.
2401 2018-01-25 18:52:23 Luckily the OK Supreme Court Rules Tuesday morning that they can sue the oil company...but I’m sure they’re selling T-shirt’s so they can afford legal fees
2402 2018-01-25 18:52:16 You have no clue about our job. Jeans are protective. When walking through those engines or trying some times to fix a mechanical defect. There is plenty of sharp/hot objects. Jeans/hoodies and t shirts are cheap and easy to discard after being covered in oil.
2403 2018-01-25 18:52:11 $SKPO with oil prices rising keep an eye on this one ZERO convertible notes on the books low float L2 super clean
2404 2018-01-25 18:51:58 Cuando siento que todo es muy complicado ir al centro es una forma de ver que soy yo viviendo esta experiencia daniel Oil #PNL #soyfandelavida
2405 2018-01-25 18:51:50 Yes but you cannot cook with Olive oil it should only. E added after you've finished cooking! You cannot wait we good in it because it becomes cancerous by using it to get with. Grapeseed oil and Avocado oil does not. While we should keep away from fried foods, those oils r safe
2406 2018-01-25 18:51:47 psa: if you have a pimple, put some vitamin e oil on it & go about your business. works wonders
2407 2018-01-25 18:51:46 Tell him to drink castor oil and that everything is going to be alright 
2408 2018-01-25 18:51:33 I’ve started using a 50/50 Nuln Oil and Nuln Oil Gloss mix. It’s a game changer! 
2409 2018-01-25 18:51:32 Lmao it’s oil field or Navy now.......
2410 2018-01-25 18:50:55 There's a time element to project negotiation and development that people forget. Just because the price is $70/b today, doesn't mean it'll be that high when FID is taken. And if the #oil price has found a new base, the market found it. Not Yergin.
2411 2018-01-25 18:50:48 #ukog The Singleton well site has been producing oil and gas since the Singleton field was first discovered in the 1980s.The site has been developed over the past 25 years and, since 2009, has operated 6 oil and gas wells which produce approximately 500 barrels of oil per day.

2414 2018-01-25 18:50:41 Hey @jiffylube - kudos to your staff at store #154 (Jonestown Rd, Harrisburg Pa) for fast, friendly service today. 15 minutes start-to-finish for an oil change. Really pleased. You've got a great crew at that location.
2415 2018-01-25 18:50:39 How disgusting !!  That money to me is oil to heat my house for the winter

2418 2018-01-25 18:50:10 What are your favorite tips to keep your cabinets clean? We love the N-Hance Cabinet Cleaner to gently, yet effectively, clean dirt, grime and oil from the cabinet.
2419 2018-01-25 18:50:06 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead. 2 Samuel 14:2
2420 2018-01-25 18:50:00 3, hemp oil included.
2421 2018-01-25 18:49:58 Yes, “economically unviable”. There’s no money in oil. Uh huh...
2422 2018-01-25 18:49:46 Taking girls out and buying them drinks is old school.
 We are taking them out to go get their oil changed and tires rotated cause safety is first
2423 2018-01-25 18:49:46 Never are they taking two hours for a fucking oil change
2424 2018-01-25 18:49:37 #Commodities look set for big time hit on pending $DXY reversal. Short $natgas $dgaz short $gold $dust short $oil $dwt
2425 2018-01-25 18:49:23 And, gas and oil execs had nothing to do with it.
2426 2018-01-25 18:49:23 I don’t get the flu shot bc that’s mind control poison from the government!! I stay healthy by eating of KALE, drinking coconut oil and grapefruit (extract) and rubbing activated charcole on my body several times a day .!

Hi it’s me, your favorite Facebook friend, Amber
2427 2018-01-25 18:49:19 I feel good. I got my oil changed before it was time 
2428 2018-01-25 18:49:19 Yet we need oil and fossil fuel for everything we do. From computers, cell phones, machines, power generation, driving, roads, buildings, etc. But go ahead and kill it, bring us back to cave man era, oh wait you'd ban fires for warmth to. Hhmmmmm.
2429 2018-01-25 18:49:13 Thanks boo.
But I’ve been using cleansing my face with this face scrub, followed by Ambi fade cream. Then as a moisturizer I use this oil serum (vitamin c and collagen) and another collagen serum on top. It’s a lot but it works.
All products from Ross.
I also use a 24k gold
2430 2018-01-25 18:49:13 Big Oil loves tax relief, with these fast high rising gas prices, Exxon says thank u for supplying people to pay higher gas prices so Exxon can make way more money. Plenty of Oil & Gas. Plenty. Tax relief, what a joke, cause higher prices just take it all back. Pitiful. 
2431 2018-01-25 18:49:04 Took my car to get an oil change and dude said Kia? the disrespect SMFH do i look like a drive a Kia????? lmao omg
2432 2018-01-25 18:49:01 That's why we use odd terms for the finest natural resources... "Crude" Oil, "Rough" Diamond, "Raw" Gold...

2436 2018-01-25 18:48:49 Yeah. That's the problem. Just see the price of cooking oil in glass bottles. Exorbitant!

2440 2018-01-25 18:48:08 How could anyone much less a gov agency keep track of all these Oil and Gas and liquids companies, all separate, for each leg of the process of fracking to protect from liability in case of an accident.  The heartbeat of the pipeline industry which again is separate from O&G co's
2441 2018-01-25 18:48:02 You need olive oil ( -- source;  Popeye the sailor man) ...
2442 2018-01-25 18:47:57 Been going on for a lot longer but now it's in the news. Big Oil stopped the electric car in the 80's and big Oil has been in the Middle East since the 40's
2443 2018-01-25 18:47:45 @jerseymikes Was wondering what kind of frying oil you use?
2444 2018-01-25 18:47:44 The name Canola oil derived from two words, Can--Canada, then oil, because Canada invented this oil according to my research. It was created out of GMO Rapeseeds, this is how it got its bad rap in the very beginning!!!
2445 2018-01-25 18:47:43 Lol arabs will give a second look your favs if they milk oil.. sure nothing changes
2446 2018-01-25 18:47:41 hmmm....still life challenge? Portrait of a friend? Something original but fun to get the juices flowing. I don't know! I'm still just as stuck. My goal is to find an original portrait style with acrylic or oil paints....

2449 2018-01-25 18:47:27 Imagine the Ultra Comics action figure though. It begs you not to buy it to complete your collection, and when you do, it tells you exactly how much money and oil your toy collection is wasting.
2450 2018-01-25 18:47:18 After all my oil,sho sick?
2451 2018-01-25 18:47:14 Oil, and five minutes with a flame thrower.
2452 2018-01-25 18:47:05 Glamglow def is amazing, face wise! Body wise, coconut oil is my bff, honestly. Head to toe.
2453 2018-01-25 18:47:04 @aiko_mme aiko , the story changes . The Van Gogh exhibition was very good . There ware many oil paintings and drawings , and Hokusai Katsushika , Hiroshige

2456 2018-01-25 18:46:54 LOL gonna add him to your flock of defenders.. whatever makes you feel better about saving that Oil money. Which still couldn’t attract ALexis. Why’s it so hard to just say “damn, utd got him. FairPlay.” But no, you compare longevity on two players that can’t even be compared

2459 2018-01-25 18:46:40 Irving oil! People like them!
2460 2018-01-25 18:46:37 I don't follow many Flames fans but the ones I do follow aren't like that. Truth is, Oil Country has it fans that can also be abrasive. I can even lump myself into that category at times when I'm feeling salty.
2461 2018-01-25 18:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2462 2018-01-25 18:46:21 For as much as @realDonaldTrump talks about being “good” for the middle class. How about those skyrocketing oil/gas prices. This is what happens when you put the former head of @exxonmobil in your administration. #gasprices
2463 2018-01-25 18:45:49 And they now added a tariff on solar panels!  And they cut oversight and removed the 7 cent tax on barrels of oil for cleanup of super spills.  And opened up all US coastlines for mass drilling!  Oh yeah, except Florida (Mar-a-Lago) #corruptWH

My fav product ever is tea tree oil
2467 2018-01-25 18:45:30 There's oil field at Singleton. Just south of midhurst. Operated by igas
2468 2018-01-25 18:45:17 I put peppermint oil on my neck to keep me from falling asleep at school and now I’m freezing
2469 2018-01-25 18:45:08 Eggs scrambled, slow cooked over low heat with olive oil or butter--cream is totally optional. You know it is perfect if it takes 30 minutes...
2470 2018-01-25 18:45:00 Just saw a commercial for a Tony Robbins appearance. Even in just 30 seconds, he comes across as one of the slimiest bastards I've ever seen. The modern snake oil salesman, incarnate.
2471 2018-01-25 18:44:36 In the meantime while Norway visited DC, ExxonMobil was part of the largest Norwegian Awards for Oil Exploration. #nooildrilling
2472 2018-01-25 18:44:25 Sounds fishy to me @wvsenate energy committee meeting about a bill that changes older contracts to some modification, is it constitutional? Thanks to Senator Sypolt for his questions, protect the people from unscrupulous Oil and Gas companies
2473 2018-01-25 18:44:25 Does anyone have any oil rights they want t give me
2474 2018-01-25 18:44:09 I just had the best conversation with some super nice old guy at Walmart waiting for my oil change... Thanks for the stories Jeff
2475 2018-01-25 18:44:08 WTI oil at $66.35/barrel, +$0.74.
2476 2018-01-25 18:43:58 Thank you! The DEP must be an effective defender of our Commonwealth’s land and water. They’ve already been stretched thin with budget and staffing cuts; we cannot afford to weaken the department further, as it will strengthen the oil and gas stronghold that exists in PA.
2477 2018-01-25 18:43:50 That door!!! Drop some oil in those hinges #DateMyFamilyZambia
2478 2018-01-25 18:43:39 And even then, just the energy system. Demonizing oil and oil-cos is ludicrous given how insanely useful it is for almost all aspects of human endeavor. Sure, burning it is a waste!

2481 2018-01-25 18:43:30 I get the potential why, but how? It seems like plummeting oil prices were the primary, secondary and tertiary causes.
2482 2018-01-25 18:43:22 Mines for materials are owned mainly by Brazil and China. An extra 30% makes them more unaffordable for most, and not competitive against oil based energy sources etc. Oil receives heavy tax breaks by comparison to remain top choice in an uneven field.
2483 2018-01-25 18:43:10 ...I swear anytime I use oil, my face reacts IMMEDIATELY.
It never used to be this way..
2484 2018-01-25 18:42:52 そうなんですよね…せめて内心では俺SUGEEEEしておかないと気力値が下がって技も撃てなくなり…
2485 2018-01-25 18:42:41 I know you're being sarcastic, but I just want to publicly state that she is weapons grade stupid. Could use her head to drill for oil.
2486 2018-01-25 18:42:36 Girl I’m on my way to the vitamin store to get some tea tree oil...
2487 2018-01-25 18:42:36 follower hacking/social media gaming is modern day snake oil
2488 2018-01-25 18:42:34 Trump is threatening to hold aid to Palestinians, condescending statement. What is Saudi Arabia and the very rich Gulf States doing with this treatment of one of their own? STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. You have oil and you can do business with other nations.
2489 2018-01-25 18:42:18 Agreed. But how about doing the  groundwork to set up the industry BEFORE grinding the whole business to a stop? No mention of any incentives to build them in the US. ZILCH It's Chinese, it's not oil or coal, so kill it. After all global warming is a hoax right?
2490 2018-01-25 18:42:06 It’s one of those days where you just need to marinate your entire life in coconut oil.
2491 2018-01-25 18:41:59 “God gives beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning. The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. I rebuke depression, and shatter its stronghold in the life of anyone here gathered. Your mind and emotions are set free, in Jesus’ name” #SarahThompson #WorshipExperience
2492 2018-01-25 18:41:44 CIA systematically destroyed Venezuela - as Chavez told the U.S. to fuck off.  Chavez was friend's with Cuba, helped Cuba, nationalized industries, pissed off Big Oil - so they sicked the CIA on his ass.  And it worked.
2493 2018-01-25 18:41:43 peanut oil is good. I heard
2494 2018-01-25 18:41:06 @AliVelshi   All this talk of more $ in paychecks and ability to help middle class.  @GOP would be right. Any $ can help pay for the increasing energy cost as gas and oil prices go up.  So much for extra $ in our pocket.
2495 2018-01-25 18:40:59 So if this passes the greentard states like California will never allow oil drilling.
2496 2018-01-25 18:40:47 Yeah, I don't think oil experience has really been a big criteria for board selection in recent history.
2497 2018-01-25 18:40:42 Big deal...it doesn't explain the hypocrisy of a 'chicken little', in a LARGE private jet, running around the world espousing these irresponsible statements & scare tatics, to make millions. Then selling his network (Current TV) for 'Oil Money'...
2498 2018-01-25 18:40:41 There’s an oil for that
2499 2018-01-25 18:40:23 At the beginning of 2017 the US dollar was the strongest it’s been since 1986 the worlds oil supplies are based in US dollars so if there’s cheap crude oil and cheap gas that means the dollar is strong
2500 2018-01-25 18:40:23 Total US solar industry employs more people than gas and oil mfg plants but nowhere near the millions at work in the industry total.Tariff is on imported panels, Does this mean US manufacturers can compete now?
2501 2018-01-25 18:40:22 Yeah the oil and gas companies are so cocky they're fracking at the base of Yellowstone too. Can't wait to hear about that earthquake
2502 2018-01-25 18:40:18 US Oil and gas corporations still pissed off?
2503 2018-01-25 18:40:14 Right? This is what it looks like on every Palestinian itinerary, as well. 

"Okay, today we discuss killing the Jews and hating America. Also on the agenda, how we are going to spend our oil money for the week. Oh, and don't forget it's "beat your woman if she takes off 1/
2504 2018-01-25 18:40:08 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
2505 2018-01-25 18:40:05 Two failing Solar Companies lobbied for this. Speculation is these 2 companies were hurting not from competition but by mismanagement. Seems to me this tariff helps  US Solar Lobbyists, Coal Lobbyists & Gas & oil Lobbyists.
2506 2018-01-25 18:40:02 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
2507 2018-01-25 18:40:01 Yeah, Al Gore did no good! It's not about citations, it's about having watched professional academics during my childhood, my stepfather is one. The data was convincing enough in 1985, and is more comprehensive and clear now. Only vested interests in the oil industry deny it :-/
2508 2018-01-25 18:39:51 Well they stated that even if western crude gets to the east coast! They will still import Saudi oil! Fu#^ them! Who the hell are they to Western Canadians!

2516 2018-01-25 18:39:11 Low maintanance? Oh count the oil guy out
2517 2018-01-25 18:38:52 Our security is not enhanced by having NATO forces sabre-rattling along the EU periphery of Russia. The US should not be weaponising the disparate Muslim faiths to fight against each other on our behalf because of their oil.
2518 2018-01-25 18:38:43 i wish my car took regular oil , that synthetic shit too fucking high bruh .
2519 2018-01-25 18:38:42 Big oil funds both sides of the debate, thats why you are stuck with the same talking points and #MSM broadcasts denier & alarmist rhetoric,genuine ppl share #science-tific context!If your side is right you'd be able to share the facts in Context!What potential change is 120 Co2?

2525 2018-01-25 18:38:05 $1000.00 is the difference between driving a car with insurance and oil changes or not.
2526 2018-01-25 18:37:58 How does oil derricks in the middle of the ocean add up to more tourism?
2527 2018-01-25 18:37:56 There is no standardization of royalty collection and distribution, each company has there own way of doing it, can you imagine how this can be taken advantage of by unscrupulous OIL and GAS MIDSTREAM Companies. @WVpolicywonk @GaryZuckett
2528 2018-01-25 18:37:56 It’s just baby dandruff/dry scalp. You can either use baby oil and let it sit for a couple minutes and comb it out or wash it and do it. My son had it too
2529 2018-01-25 18:37:54 I want good services that aren't threatened every time the price of oil drops. Bring in a small consumption tax and, in boom times, save that extra cash for the next downturn. Running deficits is expensive so a small tax could actually cost us less than the end of the day.
2530 2018-01-25 18:37:50 i need an oil change SOOOOO bad , my car sound terrible . i was posed to get one yesterday morning but my lazy ass forgot to set my alarm

2534 2018-01-25 18:37:41 Mom is in the oil change on my car
2535 2018-01-25 18:37:41 Is it true that only oil fired engines can run on logs? Or could any?
2536 2018-01-25 18:37:39 Any kind of seafood is healthy. I like to cook medium size shrimp in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil and garlic until they curl up. Eat with a salad, vegetable or baked potato. So filling.

2542 2018-01-25 18:37:05 Nice way to deal with your allies.
It would be interesting to see what would happen if Canada stopped the oil from flowing south and cut the electricity that powers most of the eastern part of the USA.
2543 2018-01-25 18:36:59 Tea tree oil is heaven sent wow
2544 2018-01-25 18:36:55 Becerra is more concerned with isolating his State as a sanctuary State and protecting illegals over california citizens. Oil is evidently taking a back seat.

2549 2018-01-25 18:36:19 Insomniac over here, I get it. I was late for class today cause I barely slept ahahah. Sometimes the extra rest really is necessary ! If it helps at all, I recommend melatonin to get a sleep schedule back on track and even lavender oil/aromatherapy is nice
2550 2018-01-25 18:36:17 Babeh oil is good, but if they have dry skin on their cheeks it’s normal but a little bit of baby oil should be fine or even e45 maybe?

2552 2018-01-25 18:36:01 sometimes u go to get ur oil changed which u HATE but then there is a one eyed dog named Edward there and he gives u kisses and then everything is good
2553 2018-01-25 18:35:56 @houseontherockc @pauladefarasin Happy Birthday to a wonderful man of God.
His bible teaching technique is really awesome.
A gift to this generation.
May the oil continue to flow in your life.
Wish you many more years.#PPImpact
2554 2018-01-25 18:35:51 Happy birthday Pastor Paul Adefarasin, may the oil of God upon your life never runs dry
2555 2018-01-25 18:35:45 I'm fond of Olive Oil.
2556 2018-01-25 18:35:45 ชอบอ่ะ ฟังแจ็คแรพวันนี้รอบที่ล้านละ
2557 2018-01-25 18:35:43 @UKHeatingOil just been told the latest we should receive our oil is tomorrow yet we’re not on the delivery route for tomorrow. How does that work? Useless.
2558 2018-01-25 18:35:43 Hey. Which vaps was this? We don’t add any extra oil so no idea how this can even happen... was it take away or Deliveroo?
2559 2018-01-25 18:35:30 OIL OIL OIL OIL ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS WILL BE  look at every thing going on in the Middle East. And what happen to the electric car if oil companies hadn't killed them. Russia want to sell their OIL TOO.
2560 2018-01-25 18:35:26 Tea tree oil is the answer.

2562 2018-01-25 18:35:02 I need a huge container of castor oil
2563 2018-01-25 18:34:53 Yes, I can't wait to hear all of the gushing puff pieces about #JerryBrown's address today. I bet you not one journalist other than yours truly will mention that Brown's regulators have expanded offshore oil drilling by 17 percent in state waters, approving 238 new wells.
2564 2018-01-25 18:34:51 The wait time at this Nissan for an oil change is horrible 
2565 2018-01-25 18:34:21 Sanctions work in pair with oil price ONLY. Decrease them.
2566 2018-01-25 18:34:15 @realDonaldTrump is messing up DACA & Oil Drilling if You Remember The BP Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico The ecology environment has been Permanently affected in a Negative way #CCOT #ReleaseTheMemo #NoDACA #NoDACAAmnesty
2567 2018-01-25 18:34:11 Rubio, for all the reasons you listed, so must ALL OTHER COASTAL AREAS OT THE US, BE PROTECTED FROM OIL/ENERGY DRILLING,UNTIL THE DAY “FAIL SAFE” TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPED THAT WILL 100%, protect against a CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT. You are an empty tin can.
2568 2018-01-25 18:33:33 WV relies on the honor system to receive severance taxes from Oil and Gas industry, can you believe that?  There should be a way to study this to avoid shortfalls in collections due 2 unscrupulous gas companies. WV treasury needs the money for teachers @GaryZuckett @WVpolicywonk
2569 2018-01-25 18:33:23 Biotin or castor oil ! Or both 
2570 2018-01-25 18:33:19 Loading up our roster!
2571 2018-01-25 18:33:13 guess who almost blinded herself by mistaking the acetone bottle as the castor oil bottle. Tanga
2572 2018-01-25 18:33:10 @Braungardtanner I Threw up my fish oil pill.... 
2573 2018-01-25 18:33:06 OMG still talking about the election and 1 single black supporter. He had nothing to do with black home ownership thats Obamas legislation. SOS Mice still.following pied piper. Wait til they lose insurance and breath dirty air while watching the oil.rigs off their coasts!
2574 2018-01-25 18:32:58 We dont want to die for oil and gas and geopolitical interests of NATO leader USA. Carnegie is one of many lobby organisations with the aim of more weapons on this world...
2575 2018-01-25 18:32:51 But I thought the people wanted to have a say in what happens. Oh maybe they just meant rich people and oil barons.
2576 2018-01-25 18:32:50 But yeah I hate this lmao every time I’d take my car to the dealership they’d be like u need $500 worth of repairs like BITCH I just need an oil change
2577 2018-01-25 18:32:47 Logan this morning.   I enlarged and cropped pictures I took from a distance. He is moving much better since going on CBD oil
2578 2018-01-25 18:32:47 I love the feeling of a fresh oil change
2579 2018-01-25 18:32:46 OIL DIFF: 4.9 -> 4.9
2580 2018-01-25 18:32:42 She makes millions from selling her snake oil to schools Michael, she won’t starve.
2581 2018-01-25 18:32:35 Put in an effort to start.

2583 2018-01-25 18:32:22 Mayor Greg Dionne giving the State of the City address. Big news: @cityof_pa plans to ask Husky for further funds as an apology for the damage done during the 2016 oil spill. Says he's happy with work so far, but more needed.
2584 2018-01-25 18:32:20 “Look here bitch. I just need an oil change. I don’t have time for anything else.”
2585 2018-01-25 18:31:52 Again with the oil money sour grapes.  Got anything new to bring to the table. That’s so lame
2586 2018-01-25 18:31:49 This is how gentrification happens. First the T-Rexes move in and the next thing you know raptors are selling beard oil and artisanal ice.
2587 2018-01-25 18:31:31 lowkey wanna cop a oil pen now.
2588 2018-01-25 18:31:31 This is not a "jobs" move, or even an "economic" move. The point is to slow adoption of renewable energy sources to protect his oily moneybags donors. The Koch industry is based largely on oil.
2589 2018-01-25 18:31:27 Sounds like he's run out of money and oil
2590 2018-01-25 18:30:59 And an oil billionaire runs each program, so not much different than today.
2591 2018-01-25 18:30:56 Oil rivalry for who has the most oil /s
2592 2018-01-25 18:30:48 What About Oil?
Oil Source and Use

Oil Source
2593 2018-01-25 18:30:46 Better than three quarters of solar panels are imported! Tariffs serve no one but people like the Kochs and the rest of the oil and gas consortiums Get a better talking point Sir This explanation in defense of this isn’t credible or factual in premise
2594 2018-01-25 18:30:43 Tea tree oil is the best
2595 2018-01-25 18:30:35 You make it sound like it’s easy lol.  We fight it here everyday and at every turn. Their con views are plenty entrenched as is. Isolation, religion, oil money are all factors.  For us to just ‘be Alabama’ isn’t that easy.  Also, we don’t have a child molester running for office.
2596 2018-01-25 18:30:34 Atlanta traffic is like driving in Nascar. All I need is a helmet and a beer and where cooking with peanut oil  Till we meet again 
2597 2018-01-25 18:30:29 I use the drinkable aloe from the health food store, the Body Shop's Tea Tree mask and mattifying lotion, and a special tea tree/almond oil/rose/aloe blend I found at Target
2598 2018-01-25 18:30:12 That might because he shares an affinity with Trump for fracking, polluting aquifers and building infrastructure projects. #JerryBrown's regulators have expanded offshore oil drilling in #CA, approving 238 NEW offshore wells. Trump wants to do what Brown has done.
2599 2018-01-25 18:30:03 I've really givin up on ever getting our oil to to the east coast! Too many people like the Irving clan! Globalists! We need to get our oil out to the west coast limit our shipments to trump for fair pricing!Ship oil through Churchill Manitoba! We shipped grain out of there!
2600 2018-01-25 18:29:52 served as a salad or a side dish?
not very inviting
and poor in ingredients
the oil is poisonous (if the automated translator was right)
good for cars
2601 2018-01-25 18:29:22 Omg I hugged Kaya like > 30mins ago and I still smell her rose oil 
2602 2018-01-25 18:29:14 Lol but u close to oil money.
2603 2018-01-25 18:28:55 Yes it’s crazy my dad been having his oil for all his life. To this day it sits in his hygiene bag, stored away in his closet somewhere away from where people can touch and get a ahold of
2604 2018-01-25 18:28:44 The most important thing to consider when determining the cost of your new furnace is the energy source. Is it electric, gas, or oil?
2605 2018-01-25 18:28:42 potato chip scream when it touch the oil
2606 2018-01-25 18:28:41 More meaningless chatter, because there will never be a good deal for TPP.  oil & gas The industry simply doesn't need it.
2607 2018-01-25 18:28:30 Cut them in half, toss with olive oil and salt and lemon pepper. Add sliced leeks and roast in a Dutch oven or covered pot until browned on the outside, a bit carmelized, and tender. The best!
2608 2018-01-25 18:28:13 Clear pair trade, #crudeoil $USD Dollar index was a clear leading indicator for the rising crude oil $USO
2609 2018-01-25 18:28:12 I heard putting some vitamin e or coconut oil on cuts might help them not scar if you’re super worried about that
2610 2018-01-25 18:27:45 • coconut oil on my skin... i learnt from last season loool so let people have their fun on the internet. Fact is time will show success in the end.
2611 2018-01-25 18:27:43 I try so hard to diet but my mom buys so much red meat lol and cooks in oil everyday it's hard to get healthy stuff I feel like when I finnaly have my own spot il be able to stay in track since I'm doing dinner 
2612 2018-01-25 18:27:42 Ask all the people being laid off from their jobs how great this was. He did it for Big Oil and other fossil fuel corps. He doesn't care if not rich and giving him money
2613 2018-01-25 18:27:16 It is one of Koch Bros propaganda fronts. Koch is one of the biggest players in the AB oil industry and promotes right wing dogma to cut any progressive move that might impact their bottom line. Truth is a distant cousin to Fraser Institute.
2614 2018-01-25 18:27:13 Also  coconut oil in his fur for a while day then give him a bath the next morning.  It works wonders
2615 2018-01-25 18:26:44 And a massive economy. Just because we have a smaller landmass doesn’t mean we should ignore the opportunity to support the economy for 50 years. If your argument held true we would not have developed the oil and gas industry in the U.K. look at the wealth and jobs that generated
2616 2018-01-25 18:26:32 L'oreal Everpure has my made hair softer than anything ever and I've only heard good things about the EverCurl line....it's got coconut oil and is sulfate free
2617 2018-01-25 18:26:32 Too bad it’s just an exhibition game for the Oil.
2618 2018-01-25 18:26:22 Forever wearing lavender oil instead of perfume now
2619 2018-01-25 18:26:21 i just bought CBD oil for my fibromyalgia and i swear to christ if that $50 300ml bottle doesn’t sort me out I will just have to die
2620 2018-01-25 18:26:00 Yes I love to use aromatherapy oil when massage the girl, give a normal massage then body to body massage
2621 2018-01-25 18:25:54 Duke energy in Florida raising rates thanks to Trump tariffs on solar panels. My tax cuts gone with gas going up every week and Trump tariffs and now higher utilities. But big oil big winners as usual from republicans
2622 2018-01-25 18:25:49 @DougHenwood So Cato Institute's Deirdre McCloskey is visiting my Uni soon to sell her snake oil (Bourgeois dignity achieved the modern world). Any good, concise opposing literature? Worker resistance to bourgeois consciousness?

2624 2018-01-25 18:25:43 Let us know what you pay for oil changes and we'll see if we can beat it!
2625 2018-01-25 18:25:15 Do like my grannies did. Oil it up, build a fire throw it in the fire for a hour or two.
2626 2018-01-25 18:25:08 No oil, no running car. I know, I made that mistake once. Learn from my error!
2627 2018-01-25 18:24:53 LePage knows that renewable energy is the work of the devil, because all of Trump's friends have shares in oil and coal.
2628 2018-01-25 18:24:47 That would fill my Oil Tank 2-3 times!! I'll take whoever doesn't want theirs, and be grateful for it!
2629 2018-01-25 18:24:45 No one in the northeast US use COD Oil. They are an awful "company" and will be no help to you. Only cause you stress. #oil #newenglandoil #badbusiness
2630 2018-01-25 18:24:42 I never wanted to be an essential oil untill now these damn hormones.
2631 2018-01-25 18:24:34 Michael! Use Hemp Oil daily for inflammation. No THC and high in Omega 3 & 6. Great help
2632 2018-01-25 18:24:32 This is a bot...#ReleaseTheMemo and by the way this robot needs more oil. All this undercover mischief using lots of oil
2633 2018-01-25 18:24:24 The essential thing i keep close beside me in my bed for this past few days is some kind of sick. A vi*ks vapo rub, vi*ks inhaler, and a bottle of eucalyptus oil ... i mean these are really 'sick'. lmao my jokeeeesss isssss soooooo funnyyyyy
2634 2018-01-25 18:24:15 I left my earbuds and charger at home thinking my car was only getting an oil change. Turns I needed more and now I’m stuck at the dealership. 
2635 2018-01-25 18:24:07 Killing the solar industry is the whole idea.  Lots of oil and gas donors they have to keep happy.
2636 2018-01-25 18:24:04 We ought to have
on our radar screen
the subject of oil
Venezuela, the Caucauses [sic], Indonesia
anywhere we think it may exist
and how it fits
into our strategies

--Don Rumsfeld the poet, 31 July 2001
2637 2018-01-25 18:23:54 That's all we had.  Olive oil didn't turn up till I was in college.  I mostly use olive these days,  but I do have sesame and grapeseed oil on hand for certain meals.
2638 2018-01-25 18:23:51 your oil's my only desire
relight my fryer 
cause I neeeeed your cod
2639 2018-01-25 18:23:35 When i get in people cars first thing i look at is if the engine light on, low tire pressure light on, mileage, oil allat.
2640 2018-01-25 18:23:30 I’ll have to add other ingredients like spices and some palm oil
2641 2018-01-25 18:23:18 The usability of #InfoChip spans many industries, including oil & gas and mining, allowing asset tracking anywhere.
2642 2018-01-25 18:22:55 A bit ironic from the country that got rich on oil revenue.
2643 2018-01-25 18:22:54 And then: oil fc, no fans, no history in alternating order
2644 2018-01-25 18:22:52 Yes!  We need clean water, land, air more than we need more oil and gas drilling
2645 2018-01-25 18:22:50 Thank you Senator Hoeven! This is GREAT news. ND is at the forefront of methods of capturing oil & gas that are good for both the environment AND  the economy. This has taken a lot of work on the part of many at the state level & many forward thinking oil companies.
2646 2018-01-25 18:22:44 Does seem to diminish  skill, craft, or just dumb luck of fishing in the same way shooting an Ibex tied to a tree doesn't make you a hunter
2647 2018-01-25 18:22:22 The only oil I don’t recommend cooking with is baby oil lol never squeeze a baby 
2648 2018-01-25 18:22:16 People pray for cake , then god gives them eggs, batter, oil, icing , a pan and a oven then they leave the kitchen . Like what more do you want  
2649 2018-01-25 18:21:48 I used the black castor and flaxseed eco style gel the olive oil one is canceled
2650 2018-01-25 18:21:36 6. Menurut saya, pada september 2018 sampai awal tahun 2019, perekonomian nasional akan diterpa kesulitan perekonomian. Mulai dari anjloknya harga komoditi ekspor unggulan, anjloknya nilai tukar rupiah, naiknya harga Crude Oil dan turunnya IHSG.
2651 2018-01-25 18:21:14 Mr Alabadi has released some points in media,which was not discuss with Mr Barzani in Davos such as delivery all oil and Airport to Iraqi Gov. But he should release Kurdistan employees salary first because he has promised many times but unfortunately he has not done yet
2652 2018-01-25 18:21:06 ｵｯ　て開いたけどこの低気圧期に見るものじゃないとそっ閉じしてしまいましたｗ
2653 2018-01-25 18:21:06 But... his snake oil was made from actual snakes...
2654 2018-01-25 18:21:06 Iran is the younger nation with a more secular, anti-Sharia population that's been fighting Isis yet it's them we need to be afraid of while our "ally" Saudi Arabia with the same ideology as Isis gets a pass.  Because of corporate and oil interests.  Saudi is good for business.
2655 2018-01-25 18:20:59 Waiting for @JerryBrownGov 2018 State of the State Address. He is sure to touch on #climate but will he talk about phasing out oil drilling in CA? 3/4 of CA’s oil is as climate-damaging as Canadian tar sands crude. #SOTS18
2656 2018-01-25 18:20:50 It's a long story, Mario. Green Decoys came out of an advertising group in Washington DC that works closely with the oil and gas industry. It's an attempt to discredit people who believe in conservation. If you dig into the Green Decoys site, you can follow the tracks.
2657 2018-01-25 18:20:25 Plus I solved my dressing problem. I now add lemon juice, oil olive and balsamic vinegar 
2658 2018-01-25 18:20:16 One thing I love about small towns.. the local mechanic told me to “get my ass up to the shop to get my oil changed” lol 
2659 2018-01-25 18:20:02 Honestly, can you not find a chemist to discuss this topic? Condensate is not "more soluble" than oil it is much less less and it is virtually insoluble which means there won't be a dissolved component to any extent.
2660 2018-01-25 18:20:00 cheeseかわいいから買うことにした☺︎
2661 2018-01-25 18:20:00 Cbd oil and maybe an edible to knock you out. Your body is literally at war with itself and all these symptoms are just signs of victory, FOR THE NORTH!
2662 2018-01-25 18:19:59 Coconut oil is a hair saver
2663 2018-01-25 18:19:55 I took a couple attempts. The first time I used too much oil and didn't wipe enough off, so I ended up with a weird sticky coating. Had to burn it off on my gas grill and start over!
2664 2018-01-25 18:19:46 OOOH thank you! I might have to order that serum on my next Sephora order! I might be upping my coconut oil usage too. I think my mistake was thinking weekly masks was enough lol
2665 2018-01-25 18:19:40 He's an Arab. Yeah they're much richer than any American because of oil.
2666 2018-01-25 18:19:37 We're like oil and water.
2667 2018-01-25 18:19:32 My life, my love, my drive, it came from…Pain
2668 2018-01-25 18:19:31 get a honda or a toyota, i used to pay $90 for oil changes before i started doing them myself
2669 2018-01-25 18:19:26 Fish oil definitely!! My pit has short hair that feels coarse and I started giving her fish oil and her coat is so soft and thick now!!
2670 2018-01-25 18:19:26 ガッデム！！眠りが浅い…勉強でもするか？多分キャスやった所為だよな
2671 2018-01-25 18:19:25 He did admit to “unknowingly” taking PEDs. “I thought it was flaxseed oil.”

2674 2018-01-25 18:19:16 So $FROT is an oil and gas tech company (hot area) looking to start into blockchain (even hotter area) with a low float, good looking website, and news? Did i catch all that correctly? Sounds like a gold mine

2676 2018-01-25 18:18:14 Why am i still waiting for this oil change 
2677 2018-01-25 18:17:55 Soak nails in olive oil for five minutes for deep moisturizing.
2678 2018-01-25 18:17:53 All oil is chikat. Work out with oiled hair and you'll understand.
2679 2018-01-25 18:17:44 security of oil or security of political allies?
2680 2018-01-25 18:17:30 Marinating chicken in motor oil. Also unexpected.
2681 2018-01-25 18:17:28 So, you're saying that you're cattish on Heating Oil?
2682 2018-01-25 18:17:25 surely you jest. everything points to the raven man being Uncle Istvan wearing urza's power armor.... tainted by phyrexian oil.
2683 2018-01-25 18:17:20 smh. that time you tweet about cbd oil and "green" accounts start following you. they'll be sorely disappointed with my twitter content.
2684 2018-01-25 18:17:19 Mr Alabadi you have released some points in media,which was not discuss with Mr Barzani in Davos such as delivery all oil and Airport to Iraqi Gov. But you should release Kurdistan employees salary first because you have promised many times but unfortunately you have not done yet
2685 2018-01-25 18:17:01 i tried to make a vanilla coke/chocolate mugcake (because if i don't try out all this whacky mad scientist bullshit who will??)
unfortunately i reduced the sugar (coke shoud be sweet enough!) and didn't reduce the oil (should have) so it tastes like mayonnaise and disappointment.
2686 2018-01-25 18:16:46 I love kale chips with coconut oil! Both are super beneficial #GlowGetter
2687 2018-01-25 18:16:44 True but we have agriculture! Potash! Oil,heavy oil! Coal! Forest products! Water usually lots of it which is going to become increasingly relevant in the world!! We are independent if we choose to be! We do not need Foreign criminals to exploit our resources!
2688 2018-01-25 18:16:40 Oil yourself
2689 2018-01-25 18:16:26 Oil.... what oil?
2690 2018-01-25 18:16:19 Pretty much. But many people never use soap on it. Just hot water. The build up of oil prevents rust. Soap takes the oil off, hence the need to reseason.
2691 2018-01-25 18:16:10 Oil got way ahead of itself.way to many long contracts with dollar weakening was quickly the recipe for over shooting price
2692 2018-01-25 18:16:07 Was watching a car tailgating one of those oil tank trucks and thinking, What is the best case scenario here?
2693 2018-01-25 18:16:06 Love your tweet. Seamy charlatan peddling snake oil to a world...Great Stuff.

2698 2018-01-25 18:15:06 How was I unaware that my car is a 6.2 v8 until I went to get my oil changed today...
2699 2018-01-25 18:15:05 Yep - I brown the sausages in a pan first because I don’t like when they are anaemic looking at the bottom. Then put the sausages and stuffing balls in the dish with some oil for 15 mins, then add the batter :-)

2701 2018-01-25 18:14:45 I've given up on trading oil. Soo much geopolitical risk and tons of quants manipulating the price. Short term is anyone's guess, but long term contracts remain cheap compared to front month contracts. Long oil is the only trade right now. Short term just gambling.
2702 2018-01-25 18:14:11 The average oil and gas worker in Ohio makes $30,247 more than the statewide figure.

2703 2018-01-25 18:14:07 when we got our husky he had that if you put vegetable oil ( little drops) in his food it will help or we rubbed coconut oil on him and let it sit over night and washed him and didn’t for a couple days and it cleared up really fast.
2704 2018-01-25 18:14:04 2. Peel and cut the onion into eighths, and put into a freezer bag with the oil, mustard, dried sage, a good grinding of pepper, the lemon juice, the squeezed-out husks cut into eighths, and the Worcestershire sauce.  #foodiethursday
2705 2018-01-25 18:14:00 Watching #DesignatedSurvivor is my kind of burning the midnight oil. Sadly, I finished one season way too early. Can't wait for the upcoming season next month.
2706 2018-01-25 18:13:51 Super happy that my share of the oil season tickets come in feb-March when the season is mathematically over. 

Thanks @EdmontonOilers #LetsGoOilers

2709 2018-01-25 18:13:44 It makes sense that royalties aren’t dollar for dollar of the value of the oil. There has to be plenty of room for drilling costs and profit.

2714 2018-01-25 18:12:55 Going on 2.5 hours to get an oil change. Why did I do this on my day off.....
2715 2018-01-25 18:12:51 I spray it w/olive oil, sprinkle parmesan cheese, and bake it on low heat for an hour
2716 2018-01-25 18:12:37 But also I just washed my face with a drunk elephant bar and my Clarisonic and followed w the marula oil and my face is so soft

2744 2018-01-25 18:09:57 You stated why you think @realDonaldTrump destroyed the Solar industry, "none of us voted..."

Fact, solar is not a substitute for oil or coal. Fact, it takes power to manufacture solar cells & components to assemble a system. Fact, no sun no power! Fact, improperly installed 0!

2750 2018-01-25 18:09:18 They say to wash after cooking with soapy water, put on burner to evaporate the water..do another thin layer of oil before storing. Is all that necessary?
2751 2018-01-25 18:09:13 Use a cuticle oil, it helps your nails be more flexible in dry weather. Solar oil is a really good one. I line the Sally Hanson vit e oil too
2752 2018-01-25 18:08:49 @ARiimala If you are a designer at Valtra, i wanna give you some tips:
- Make tractors that can handle many years of hard use, use more steel and such.

- Remember that many farmers will have fat fingers, coated in either dirt, oil or grease, make something that can handle this.

2765 2018-01-25 18:06:45 Vegan since 2011, so it's been an eye opening experience learning how to cook without using many things I once favored. Also include no oil in my cooking, so it becomes a bit more of a challenge, but very happy with the lifestyle. After all, I STILL drink beer.
2766 2018-01-25 18:06:37 We’ve been waiting for 45 minutes and they aren’t even doing the oil change yet.... Makes perfect sense that they give you coffee now. Makessssssss perfect sense.
2767 2018-01-25 18:06:36 We are sorry to hear that Luxury Lush Pud left your hands with a pink tinge. Not to worry, though! All of our dyes are food-grade and will dissolve with water. Try using oil to massage into those palms to disintegrate those pigments, too! 
2768 2018-01-25 18:06:28 Ahahahaha another lead tainted snake oil sales man dupe, Alex Jones is your "source" ahahaha!
2769 2018-01-25 18:06:12 Also, you haven't seen anything.
With price of oil going from $50 to over $65 in the past few months, look out!
2770 2018-01-25 18:06:09 I want a privateer game with provisioning, repairs during battle, jockeying for windward position, sea anchors & oil bags in storms, celestial navigation, crew morale & mutinies,...not just an FPS on a moving platform.
2771 2018-01-25 18:05:27 not olive oil or nutter
2772 2018-01-25 18:05:23 Something never change. Instead of me falling asleep waiting for my moms oil change to be done. I’m nodding off on this couch waiting for mine.
2773 2018-01-25 18:05:09 Well it says diamond on the side, they probably should have tried oil lube instead of diamonds.
2774 2018-01-25 18:05:06 make sure it's Not high temp oil
2775 2018-01-25 18:05:05 So worried... then why are you on Twitter? All that coal, oil and gas needed to run all those servers. I guess that does count, right? Seems like you’re all talk. And there is no proof of global climate change due to carbon pollution.

2782 2018-01-25 18:04:29 I doubt it matters much. The main thing is to get some oil on it, and then get it hot.
2783 2018-01-25 18:04:29 LOL, the rich elite hate him? Hardly! It's just which side of rich elite you're on - the other side LOVES him. All the big businesses, all the oil men, all the coal companies, all the rich donors like the Mercers... they LOVE Trump. /1

2790 2018-01-25 18:03:34 Hi George. Yes, I support this cause. A tanker ban on the BC coast makes no sense except to continue the U.S. monopoly on Canadian oil exports. I applaud the initiative of @CalvinHelin, @ellisbross & others - leadership where there has been a void of it for far too long.
2791 2018-01-25 18:03:34 see how this chart has to have a "per" on the y-axis? That's math-speak for "lies." Basically saying, because oil was heavily subsidized in the 20th century, & the only thing we're allowed to have, that's your argument for why only oil still makes sense. Your is is your ought.

2800 2018-01-25 18:02:58 Trump putting tariffs on goods middle class use insurance utilities and gas going up quickly who really wins with a small temporary tax cut. Won’t be me for sure. Big oil owns republicans and gas raising every week now.
2801 2018-01-25 18:02:52 That's what I meant earlier.
Cod liver oil is most helpful for booster.
2802 2018-01-25 18:02:43 Learned a new machine at work today.big step, oil all over my shirt.  Dang
2803 2018-01-25 18:02:41 Trump wants to drill for oil in the PNW and I want to die. Coincidence? I think yes.
2804 2018-01-25 18:02:29 OIL DIFF: 4.78 -> 4.78
2805 2018-01-25 18:02:25 Oh, that's the spun bearing. The cylinder was disintegrating and the extra load on it's bearing caused it to seize. Not to mention the cylinder wall contaminating the oil. But it was the bad cylinder's bearing that failed.
2806 2018-01-25 18:02:24 Tip. Shift it to 401k and get 100%
2807 2018-01-25 18:02:21 i wish i could take a picture of how good the flat smells i loVE SESAME OIL
2808 2018-01-25 18:02:21 I got a cast iron skillet (yay!) researching how to season it. I'm seeing 1) after the oil put in 450 oven for 30 mins. 2) after the oil put in 350 oven for 1 hour. 

Which is better? Does it really matter?
2809 2018-01-25 18:02:17 It isnt a midas touch. It is the culmination of 8 years of recovery after the W Recession. Years of steady, solid growth are now being ramped up by the rich and greedy hoping trump repeals regulations so oil, gas and chemical companies can easily pollute and make more money
2810 2018-01-25 18:02:15 UAE +122% !!! I doubt 1% of these 112% is fair enough for such a country.
A Trough of oil generating billions of $ used in the wrong place.

2825 2018-01-25 18:00:40 What's ironic to me is that environmentalists have fought the oil industry hammer and tong for decades. If you do some research, you'll find that some of the same organizations have fought the siting of both wind and solar facilities.

2827 2018-01-25 18:00:36 China can play a big role in rebuilding Iraq through a deal of Iraqi oil and gas for China rebuilding projects in Iraq. @HaiderAlAbadi
2828 2018-01-25 18:00:02 Interesting.  So farming is not a robust industry?  Oil, coal or natural gas (and therefore according to you, no energy industry)?  The housing industry?  Pharmaceuticals?  Or is it just the solar subsidies that make something non-robust?

2837 2018-01-25 17:58:51 How did you handle pricing for dried flower versus cannabis extracts such as vape oil or shatter versus edibles? Also, products have varying THC levels so all products were unadjusted for potentcy? Finally, it looks like you used nominal versus inflation-adjusted prices. Thanks.
2838 2018-01-25 17:58:24 The head gasket rivet is inexcusable. But doesn't seem to be the failure cause. Just a symptom of poor workmanship. This engine had oil pressure issues in the head. I suspect an oil passage wasn't cleaned correctly, blocked the #3 squirter and killed it.

2880 2018-01-25 17:53:04 about as much chance as petrol prices falling when oil prices go down. Although when it goes up somehow the increase is passed on immediately

2882 2018-01-25 17:52:36 I use the white bottle! It works! Definitely thickens and grows the hair. Slightly heavy.  Great for a hot oil treatment
2883 2018-01-25 17:52:34 What kind of people work on oil rigs??
2884 2018-01-25 17:52:25 I’ve been using grape seed oil on my face and coconut oil on my forehead, also started taking a probiotic. Mines not completely better but it’s helped a lot
2885 2018-01-25 17:52:20 new anxiety game: watch the splotch on your brand new shirt and wonder if it’s water or olive oil from your salad
2886 2018-01-25 17:51:51 Give him coconut oil in his food! Look up dosage for his weight! My dog had very dry skin from allergies and it cured him! It’s also beneficial for tons of other things plus it’s all natural!
2887 2018-01-25 17:51:46 Roasted squash with red onions and chilli flakes/powder, throw in some feta for the final 10, beautiful!
Just prep desired amounts of the ingredients, in a deep dish, sprinkle of chilli powder, oil, then bung in oven (except feta) for about an hour or until squash is done.

Of course I came out with wayyyy more than 1 thing. Grabbed some fresh shrimp, naan, samosas, gyoza, sesame oil, etc....

2909 2018-01-25 17:49:14 Gunna borrow my boyfriend’s very old diesel truck and park it in that suspected racist’s driveway down the street for a good old fashioned oil leaking. Racists hate the oil leaks.

2922 2018-01-25 17:47:39 Careful with the sesame oil. A bit too much could spoil it all.
2923 2018-01-25 17:47:25 When it originally died no but I put oil in it to turn it over and the engine blew
2924 2018-01-25 17:47:20 Yeah for sure - basil-infused olive oil, red onion and garlic base and then cumin and paprika the main sources (salt and pepper standard). Tiny bit of chilli powder and you're golden - lots of people say to add coriander but I can't stand the stuff so I leave that out 
2925 2018-01-25 17:47:11 Nah, RJ. You're right. I just got wrapped up in trying to be the middle ground when I saw someone being attacked seemingly unfairly.

2931 2018-01-25 17:46:38 So a great pasta dish... fry up some (lots) garlic, chunks of halloumi, peppers and if you like them, olives in olive oil. The oil should taste quite garlicky. Toss in some cooked linguine so it gets coated in the garlicky oil... Season with black pepper...

2934 2018-01-25 17:46:21 I think they just cook it longer. A good double fry requires oil at two different temps. Lots of places do the low temp fry at a factory and then freeze it and do the final fry at the store. Because in not out doesn't freeze anything the double fry would be too expensive.
2935 2018-01-25 17:46:18 and we should not be but hey why destroy a good thing. Lets see oil goes up gas goes up no one travels anymore business struggle resorts struggle hey it's a good thing right..

2939 2018-01-25 17:45:47 And oil and coal CANNOT go on indefinately. Even if you are right economy would be affected its going to be affected at some point anyway. Real reason to deny warming is so already wealthy oil barons and coal companies can scratch every cent out.

2979 2018-01-25 17:41:18 Well this is where many industry sectors could learn a lot from sectors that do! I’m thinking of aviation and pharmaceuticals. Which others are there? Oil and gas, maybe? #innochat

America NEEDS EDUCATED EXPERIENCED LEADERS!
2986 2018-01-25 17:40:50 Wait! WHAT? Pretty sure every socialist economy has became exact same way. Venezuela was once an oil rich country but then gave the oil to the "people," which means GOVT, and now everything is shit
2987 2018-01-25 17:40:37 Still? Apparently I was reluctant to leave the womb or my mum wasnt ready... not sure.. I was 1 week late.....the midwife threatened my Mum with cod liver oil at one point(so she could not stop the contractions)... my mum had a really strong will..

2992 2018-01-25 17:40:29 45 & his cronies don’t like renewable energy becz it doesn’t line their pockets w gold like the oil/gas industry does. They couldn’t care less about any long term effects as long as they get richer
2993 2018-01-25 17:40:27 Go to war with middle east. Fund "freedom fighters." They win and turn into Al-Qaeda. We fight THEM as well as several governments that had nothing to do with 9/11 for OIL and destabilize the entire middle east, then fund more "freedom fighters" that turn into ISIS.
2994 2018-01-25 17:40:24 corporations use aborted babies like Rachael Ray uses extra virgin olive oil.
2995 2018-01-25 17:40:19 @maddow Where is SEC Chairman Jay Clayton? The WALL ST. TRAITORS are going batshit nuts with GAS/HEATING OIL at the CCM. It was bad enough when they took over the CCM and raised GAS prices 50% in 5 seconds but this latest rise is pure bullshit hurting "we the people".

2999 2018-01-25 17:39:52 Tea tree oil helps and it smells good
3000 2018-01-25 17:39:36 Looks good. My gram use to put a little Olive Oil in a pan, throw in the green beans cook a little til they're the texture you want, then put grated Italian cheese, whatever your fav is, cover with lid til the cheese melts, and enjoy 
3001 2018-01-25 17:39:35 Well this is the problem with our destiny being in that hands of another company. Why can't we operate something? Also is Lidsey as good as we thought or has the tighter oil meant this well won't be as good as we thought?
3002 2018-01-25 17:39:29 I'd be floored if they do it
3003 2018-01-25 17:39:16 I believe reduce oil price and increase oil production will make peaceful and convenient world for everyone. Reducing oil price and continue increase oil production will stop and reduce inflation in this universe.  I believe we  have
couple thousand year oil reserve in earth.
3004 2018-01-25 17:39:12 yeah i know what u mean!! that’s what i like about it is that it just melts off everything but if i don’t wash my face and tone realllly good after using it the oil+makeup just sticks to my face and clogs everything!!!

3007 2018-01-25 17:38:52 What Mark Taylor prophecied that they aren't talking about is that the oil in the Middle East is drying up-and the power over energy is about to shift. The big Oil Cartels will be out in the cold. Smile.

3010 2018-01-25 17:38:37 What would the environmental, human rights, and animal rights biographies be for the condoms and birth control? Rubber plantations wreck just as much havoc as palm oil plantations.
3011 2018-01-25 17:38:33 Well what do you expect when billionaire sheiks lock in their oil. Then another recession will hit in 5 years,!
3012 2018-01-25 17:38:31 ...conventional war?  ...perhaps, but I would predict that it would be America who draws first blood.  Looking at history since WWII, American wars have been about oil and the perpetuation of its own currency.

3015 2018-01-25 17:38:01 Buy new handluggage for laptop. Maybe some other fun stuff as a treat for yourself then check the bag in v’s ditching the oil. I think I know what I’d do....

3)dudes that tie their du rag into a ponytail.
4)females that wear side ponytails to work 
5)Excessive Bigen. Your head shouldn’t look like it needs an oil change.

3030 2018-01-25 17:36:15 Coconut oil and fish oil! It’s really good for dogs skin!
3031 2018-01-25 17:36:05 It would be ironical if the market (stocks + consumer preferences) led the way past oil and coal and cars and current construction. It would happen. The future depends on cyber and its enlargement to affect infrastructure more than superficially as now. Two USA's.

3052 2018-01-25 17:33:44 “For 40 years Dawn has helped clean up wildlife from oil spills”. 

Not to be that guy.. but don’t you think it’d be better to not have the oil spills killing the wildlife? 40 years... let’s get some better technology so oil doesn’t seep into the environment.

3055 2018-01-25 17:33:11 How many millions does the fossil fuel industry receive in subsidies? Shale only prolongs the inevitable, that we must wean ourselves off oil and gas or we get certain climate meltdown. Renewables now, another outcome is possible

3090 2018-01-25 17:29:15 Lol. To be fair to them Eurobonds are cheaper (7-8% vs 14-20% in local currency), until you factor in the risk of devaluation. But we know FG does what it likes per currency rates, and oil receipts are in USD, so the risk of default is minimal.

3106 2018-01-25 17:27:09 You are absolutely right, ma'am! #MustardOil is more than a cooking oil, more than a nutritious food item and more than a flavoured dressing. It is a powerful medicine, a #health supplement, a tonic, a restorer, a healer... and much more!

3120 2018-01-25 17:25:58 only OKST has that kind of oil money, A&M is on another level
3121 2018-01-25 17:25:57 I was 1-2x a month. The less you wash, the less oil your scalp produces. 
3122 2018-01-25 17:25:43 Appt. for oil change, seems to be taking wayyy too long. 
Oh, that's why, you were trying to find everything wrong with my car you could.
3123 2018-01-25 17:25:25 Oatmeal bath and add olive oil or coconut oil in with his food! My boxer had insanely dry skin and these two things helped a lot.
3124 2018-01-25 17:25:05 When you say "beef" are you referring to switching back to beef #tallow for deep frying? Using a flavorful, delicious frying oil like beef tallow would really show Martha how it is done.
3125 2018-01-25 17:25:04 Yep , might as well

3129 2018-01-25 17:24:28 Not just the devs, some people out there selling books, courses and conferences are shaming with snake oil as well.
3130 2018-01-25 17:24:25 The problem is I need to use lotion at work since oil takes too long to soak in and I’m using a keyboard & mouse all day  but I’ll try em out when I’m at home
3131 2018-01-25 17:24:23 It's not an essential oil, just something to put on my mask to cover up other smells in the room so I don't vomit 
3132 2018-01-25 17:24:14 You can't Groupon the Anointing. It requires sacrifice, dedication, and your Yes. No Yes No Oil.
3133 2018-01-25 17:24:01 When religions open themselves up by professing their faith, it is journalism in the US, that helps defend them from having their rights and freedoms coopted thereby. Free, unbiased press is essential to tolerance. The  Politicians selling snake oil will of course, disagree.

Oil and water don't mix. Islam is incompatible with any other culture/religion. Don't import Muslims.
Easy fix. Do it soon before your country is lost & your culture is dead.
Nothing but war & poverty with Islam.
3139 2018-01-25 17:23:30 ...Probably not for 5-10 years. We're only 10 years out right now from 2008, But the fed just went up .25 and has announced 4 more increases this year.  Oil prices starting to increase. In a debt based economy we rise to fall.
3140 2018-01-25 17:23:16 There are oatmeal based shampoos that help with dry skin. - make sure to use a dog shampoo tho, their PH is different than human. You can also give him fish oil supplements and it will help his skin. - source: worked at a vet for 5 yrs

3143 2018-01-25 17:23:02 What supplements do you use and how effective are they? I am adding Krill oil which is heavily infused with Omega 3 nutrients after doing some research.
3144 2018-01-25 17:23:01 You are a charlatan, a fake, a fraud, a snake oil salesman, etc. You are NOT a man of God like your father. STOP TRYING TO SELL GOD LIKE HE IS A 3$ BILL.
3145 2018-01-25 17:22:58  imagine waiting 5 he's just for an oil change and then BOOM they say they can't do it... that's my life
3146 2018-01-25 17:22:57 I told him I hurt my back yesterday getting on the train and it’s been hurting really bad ever since and his response was “ I can stop by and bring you some Polish oil when I get off work and rub it for you  “  I swear he’s the best
3147 2018-01-25 17:22:55 I bought a bunch of empty capsules and put the oil in them! Makes it 100% more bearable!
3148 2018-01-25 17:22:54 Lush Melting Marshmallow Moment bath oil is the absolute one. This bubble bath is the best thing that's happened today for sure.

3153 2018-01-25 17:22:34 I think every kid's first car should be a manual so they can learn how to change their own motor oil.

Of course I can drive stick.

In fact, I keep a stick in my car in case I ever need to beat someone with it.
3154 2018-01-25 17:22:33 Keep the internet under government regulations because government regulations worked so well for the airline industry, phone service, electric services, the oil industry, and everything else they stick their noses into.

3258 2018-01-25 17:10:05 It's as if "the writer who musn't be named" wakes up in the morning, grabs a cup of coffee, adds a spot of natural gas and oil, and then looks for the headline that will encourage their rabid base to freak out and go postal on liberals. #akleg
3259 2018-01-25 17:10:00 It's incredible how fast fares rise with a small increase in oil costs vs how slow fares fell when oil cratered. I'm sure it's just a coincidence...
3260 2018-01-25 17:09:55 Oil change: Replacing old oil with new oil and then having the worker basically tell you that if you drive one more mile your whole car is going to fall apart and it will be $123,789 to avoid it. Thanks buddy

3264 2018-01-25 17:09:28 Baba Yaga was near, she poured oil on their hinges, and abusing it for the girl, "Go and gnashed her go back again.
3265 2018-01-25 17:09:22 WOW, I agree. Why do we give them support any way? Why don't oil rich Arab nations help the Palestinians. They helped to create the refugee problem by attacking Israel in the 60's when they had their asses handed to them by Israel.
3266 2018-01-25 17:09:15 Anyone know anything about non profits that are actually businesses. Want to do something for riders with repairs and light duty work that they can afford on a lower budget. Ex: vets needing oil changes. Accessories added. Light work. Mostly home garage stuff that some can’t do.
3267 2018-01-25 17:09:05 The biggest struggle: dousing Karter in Gentle Baby oil mid workout so I can finish, but it just makes me sleepy too 
3268 2018-01-25 17:09:04 Is that why trump taxed solar panels? To help out his big oil buddies?
3269 2018-01-25 17:09:00 Thank goodness that is not part of the U.S. or Trump would have the oil drills there in a New York minute..
3270 2018-01-25 17:09:00 Agree it sounds scattershot. Possibly, gov thinking about eventual support for what they come up with. Only meat industry really liked #TPP11. Canadian miners/oil/pipeline firms main backers of #ISDS w/ Mexico. So possible the bilateral approach is real option 4 political reasons

3273 2018-01-25 17:08:37 Pipelines are like Skytrain in that you can carry different things in each car. So, gasoline in one batch, crude oil in another batch. Pellets probably work great for crude oil, but doesn't work for gasoline. Pellets would be great for getting crude oil to tidewater, what we need

3279 2018-01-25 17:07:51 An oil painting is not evidence. Hearsay from centuries ago is an example of weak evidence. You need scientifically verifiable, incontrovertible evidence that explains all the evidence that contradicts biblical claims. 

You can't convince us because you can't prove it.
3280 2018-01-25 17:07:44 but first of all my natural nails get a nice microcell treatment, daily oil massages and maybe even some extra biotin and silica
3281 2018-01-25 17:07:40 Dang watching you work on these makes me want to oil paint again!

3283 2018-01-25 17:07:31 Being an oil nation isn't an easy role. Yesterday, a Dutch court lifted a freeze of approximately $22 billion in oil assets. While the aftermath is still taken care of, we will continue to produce for the Euroasian region.
3284 2018-01-25 17:07:28 you probably have light scar tissue around inside of your lobes. after you shower, grab oil or lotion if you don’t have it, and massage your lobes for 15 minutes. do that until they are able to stretch
3285 2018-01-25 17:07:25 Your brain doesn’t work until it’s time to start drinking.  but i have it from 6-9 at night and that’s why i was so heated about the oil friend last night 
3286 2018-01-25 17:07:24 Could also mean higher energy prices (particularly oil) as well, no?
3287 2018-01-25 17:07:17 Wahhh wahhh all you do is cry, for a UK white nationalist and lead tainted snake oil sales man you are a real puss bag.

3293 2018-01-25 17:06:12 I’m looking at my gas and oil bills and wondering why they are going up up up!  What did we get in return for throwing our climate and health into the coal and oil magnates pocket?
3294 2018-01-25 17:06:09 Ugh. Can my oil change finish soon plEASE. I badly want to go home and squeeze in an hour of sl- oh. They're done now

3297 2018-01-25 17:05:34 It is critical to our national security interests as well as tourism-economy and the largest salmon  run on the west coast that the Pacific coast of Washington Oregon and California remained closed to oil drilling. See Marco it works for all coastal cities
3298 2018-01-25 17:05:34 Yes, if he controls a majority of the hash power he can do this. What's crazy is that he gets to keep the oil _and_ the block rewards!

You're beginning to understand how bitcoin's security model relies on the hash-power majority being honest. Your "full node" cannot protect you.
3299 2018-01-25 17:05:33 I've heard of MCT oil &  butter. But turmeric? Wow. Ok I'll try that.
3300 2018-01-25 17:05:30 Now, I need all my stalkers to screenshot my oil change tweets...and send them off. Teamwork makes the dream work! Handle that!
3301 2018-01-25 17:05:15 i find that most stuff worked for me when it didn’t have harsh stuff like fragrance an alcohol. that usually stripped my skin of all its oil and caused my skin to produce a surplus of oil and id break out!

3305 2018-01-25 17:04:18 @josefprusa got horrible wobble on my mk2, I think it has to do with the linear bearings and smooth rods, the printer has a horrible noise when it moves... I've put a lot of silicon oil on the rods, now it's acceptable until my mk2s and mk2.5 upgrades arrive :)
3306 2018-01-25 17:04:06 im covered in shrapnel and oil and we have no shower im KMS
3307 2018-01-25 17:04:05 Tea tree oil is good for blemishes but it didn't work for scarring for me. But you definitely can't put that directly on your skin, you gotta mix it
3308 2018-01-25 17:04:04 2 much oil for your pores... still love u mami
3309 2018-01-25 17:04:04 Oil come out of your pores lol I ain’t have a lot that time tho
3310 2018-01-25 17:03:55 It would be cheaper to buy the mining equipment and the costs then to pay for the oil.

3312 2018-01-25 17:03:17 Oh ok.Idk if you saw my response on Fb but lemon essential oil is legit,just don't put it directly on your skin, you should mix it with something else.But you gotta wear sunscreen everyday if you aren't already.A glamglow product broke me out ONCE so I won't try anything else lol

3317 2018-01-25 17:02:56 The 32/34 strangle in May Soybean Oil is red. Shows the dog behaviour of this market.
3318 2018-01-25 17:02:52 They are all amazing in different ways. Perhaps Loving Vincent should win because it is the first oil painted feature length animation. But at the end of the day I saw them all at the cinema and Coco is the only one I've seen twice...

3324 2018-01-25 17:01:56 I like heartily the MODI's vision,but sorry to say Modi government still failed to controlled pries rise and employment of youths in the country. I want to request him to  think once  again why GST not on OIL. It is also a major reason of price rise through out the country.

3330 2018-01-25 17:01:17 The Govt should seriously target 15% ethanol blending. With ex mill sugar prices struggling and the problem of cane arrears again cropping up.. it's best to get serious on 15% ethanol blending .This will help sugar mills and also reduce oil import bill
3331 2018-01-25 17:01:06 It's going to be about $400ish to fix the car (and this includes a very needed new air filter, oil change, and other maintenance stuff as well that I haven't been able to do till now).

You're contradicting yourself for political gains by funding & supporting these countries...
3334 2018-01-25 17:01:03 I don't think Barazani mafia will comply or fulfil their promises. They are just giving false promises as usual to fund the budget and absorb public anger before the election, they will go back to oil smuggling after the election!

3345 2018-01-25 17:00:20 Sears' one asset, property, has been declining in value steadily as e-commerce has ascended and the era of the suburban shopping-mall has ended.  The Sears business model is as obsolete as the whale oil business model.

3348 2018-01-25 17:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
3349 2018-01-25 17:00:07 I did before! Some people said teatree oil and lemon. I think they also said glam glow stuff. I just have a lot of research to do. I’m always nervous using different things together like they won’t react well.
3350 2018-01-25 16:59:51 "oil"? "fried"?
3351 2018-01-25 16:59:49 That’s because wind is clean energy power and oil is money for trump @GOP so they will push drilling oil offshore spill oil in our oceans  you know that place we eat our fish  from yummy oily food, all for the all mighty dollar! Corrupt complicit @GOP all for MONEY 
3352 2018-01-25 16:59:34 But what happens if it's getting affordable or profitabel to be dishonest and just attack it?

Someone could buy a ship load of oil for several hundred millions. Afterwards he just reorgs the chain and gets his money back...

I don't get it.
3353 2018-01-25 16:59:31 Lol I don’t have that. Someone told me to use coconut oil instead

3361 2018-01-25 16:58:29 The EPA does tremendous good, and at low cost to taxpayers relative to most agencies. You know the areas that allow the most pollution? Red states where the government is a slave to private business demands. Louisiana is largely a toxic wasteland thanks to oil industry intrusion.

3365 2018-01-25 16:58:11 Coco butter or oil is good
3366 2018-01-25 16:57:21 No problem! I also recommend gentle cleansers because I think they work best rather than something super aggressive like a scrub! then moisturize after using wh or tea tree oil and hopefully you’ll start to see a difference 
3367 2018-01-25 16:56:53 Well you see he *is* the data. His computer is himself. Put some oil in there and out come the numbers
3368 2018-01-25 16:56:41 Reminds me of the story of that first commodity trader who bought oil at $100.  Why did he do it?  To say he was the first, not because that was a legitimate price at that time.

3379 2018-01-25 16:56:03 This move is every bit as bad as letting Purcell n his peta types into the parks. When will the snake oil O$earch sells be for sale?
3380 2018-01-25 16:56:01 One of the days i realised how useless we've been (we are) in this country is when i realised oil production has been stagnant for more than three decades. Like, how? This is the so called cash cow, you can't even milk the damn thing.
3381 2018-01-25 16:55:39 Yes. The world needs more Canadian oil!!
3382 2018-01-25 16:55:26 America is on course to import very little oil although that has little to do with renewables and everything to do with fracking.

3393 2018-01-25 16:54:11 Hm. The Erdogan family wasn’t trading Isis oil?
3394 2018-01-25 16:54:05 I need a new oil cartridge  #runninglow
3395 2018-01-25 16:53:38 Hey! Checkout blog post on eSteem! esteem://cbd/@deanfieldz/cbd-hemp-oil-tinctures
3396 2018-01-25 16:53:24 Well actually i know how to put oil in there but i dont be thinking about it until my dad or step dad says something lolll
3397 2018-01-25 16:52:47 He will blame the oil price on the people of coastal states for not letting him drill.
3398 2018-01-25 16:52:46 Guess how Trump pays for his infrastructure plan? With profits from drilling for oil off of all our US coasts and fracking in our national parks!
3399 2018-01-25 16:52:39 The Oilers have built a money maker from a poor product, but it makes money for the community and makes people feel good about something (except for their play of late). Outside of Canada, nobody cares about hockey but the entire world cares about oil, we should be World leaders!
3400 2018-01-25 16:52:26 The complete mess over currency was incredible..and then to have oil collapse in a heap basically days after the result added to the idea that actually Scotland HAD dodged a bullet.  Now you have these 50%+ UK, 37% inde & don't knows that are basically *shy unionists*.
3401 2018-01-25 16:52:25 I’m going to try letting it dry before moving straight into my next step, and I’ll definitely try tea tree oil! Thank you so much girl!!
3402 2018-01-25 16:52:23 Lol, 54k oil and gas wells, residential drililng, no legislation that ties fracking to climate change or the destruction of our outdoor rec economy = complicit and definitely not advocacy; oh politics @OutdoorRetailer
3403 2018-01-25 16:52:12 I bought the oil that was John Force's primary sponsor. I told my husband I want to be as fast as him.

3411 2018-01-25 16:51:03 I would try a more reputable vendor. Reddit has a few lists of good vendors. There’s no reason for anyone to use an ounce a day, so I’d look around for better and more affordable kratom. However, it’s not a solution for everyone. I’d recommend trying CBD oil instead.
3412 2018-01-25 16:51:03 Thank you! I will boil them and put some potatoes, onion and oil.
3413 2018-01-25 16:50:56 Oil is ruining this world
3414 2018-01-25 16:50:52 Oil is also used to produce plastic. That means they shouldn't be using their phones, tablets or computers..hehe
3415 2018-01-25 16:50:46 What if getting rid of white people is Earth's plan for eco-friendly existence? Without European industrial revolution people would still be shitting in the woods and dying before reaching the age of 40. No oil spill, no carbon pollution, no overpopulation.

3418 2018-01-25 16:50:26 Yes probably... my brother had a few... all I remember is him topping the oil up every week...
3419 2018-01-25 16:50:25 El finde voy firme a fuel oil que me importa
3420 2018-01-25 16:50:13 The greed that colors the depth and breadth of all of this criminality,from Trump & associates,to the oligarchs, the oil and gas CEOs,the GOP and on& on, is confounding.I wonder is it like any addiction-starts small and grows exponentially,until they are so deep there is no exit.
3421 2018-01-25 16:50:13 I’m so sad almost all of my vitamin E oil spilled 
3422 2018-01-25 16:50:11 if the coalition is of crooks called governors and Law-makers the Man with out foreign bank account and oil block remains the best for naija.except we see New faces and test their resolve and characters.
3423 2018-01-25 16:50:08 Oil change.
3424 2018-01-25 16:50:07 I’m dying... the word NO and ME don’t go good together lol and people really know that... it’s like trying to mix oil and water together 
3425 2018-01-25 16:50:01 Care to explain what you needed that tub of baby oil for Eyeignite?
3426 2018-01-25 16:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

3432 2018-01-25 16:49:43 The price of oil is going up and by summer gas prices could reach $6.00. Trump is going to take credit for the boost in bicycle sales. "Huffy opened a new plant in Saganaw! Jobs jobs jobs!"
3433 2018-01-25 16:49:34 maybe try tea tree oil? It’s a little bit stronger and works super fast too! I use that as a spot treatment, but witch hazel I use morning & night right after I cleanse my face before adding any other products & let it dry into my skin for about 5-10 min b4 my next step!

3443 2018-01-25 16:48:25 But does it taste good?  I get the butter and maybe coconut oil, but turmeric in a beverage is just too hard to swallow
3444 2018-01-25 16:48:23 @realDonaldTrump Drilling for our own oil is a must. We must also build refineries to accommodate the production of oil.
3445 2018-01-25 16:48:23 Stop with the bullshit. You only want into Venezuela to stop the oil flow. So 'merica can stay the worlds largest polluter. More oil for us, no oil for you. Unless you buy it from one of the Fascist corporations in this country.
3446 2018-01-25 16:48:20 i keep forgetting to buy lavender oil. smh.
3447 2018-01-25 16:48:13 Because strength of Saddam was based on propaganda.

So you're suggesting same for NK? If You think that nuking NK can be anything but worse than Iraq by 100X you are wrong. 

Unless of course we're being lied to. But probably not since they have no oil.

3456 2018-01-25 16:46:49 Luckily the Oklahoma Supreme Court this week struck down the law that prohibited workers from suing oil companies for injuries that occur due to negligence.  It shocked me to read that our #okleg even passed that as a law. That I realized I should not have been shocked at all.

3473 2018-01-25 16:44:10 When I left St. Casimir's Elementary School

boil babies in oil at midnight.
Is that true?"
Not that long ago, my friends.

Then no”

3477 2018-01-25 16:43:34 Booming? Maybe to you, but to many people I know. Healthcare costs are too high, inflation still rising, oil companies still polluting, the job market is shrinking. Most are not winning anything, just struggling to keep from being homeless.

3493 2018-01-25 16:42:11 Where’s the money in that? <snark> Seriously, big oil and coal just want to wring every last bit of profit out of their already fully depreciated equipment.
3494 2018-01-25 16:42:08 We add it to help prevent the oil from separating from the peanuts. It helps with the texture and we think sustainable palm oil is worth supporting.
3495 2018-01-25 16:42:01 So ayon, bakit daw ako umiiyak sabi ng papa ko. Sa isip ko, "Uh... castor oil 'yan with aloe vera gel pero magtatanong ka na naman kung bakit ako naglalagay ng ganito so shut up na lang ako."

D.  Green eyes.
3499 2018-01-25 16:41:39 @realDonaldTrump didn’t want Scotland putting wind turbines off shore from his resort. If trump was serious, he have those oil rigs off shore of his resort in Florida.

3509 2018-01-25 16:40:53 Your concerns about coastal windfarms being hazardous for marine life and ruining the view are certainly valid. Or would be anyway, were you not in favor of replacing clean, disaster-free windmills with dangerous, damaging, polluting oil rigs.

3513 2018-01-25 16:40:45 (1/3) Thanks Chris. As an environmentalist who first moved to Tampa in 1989 and having enjoyed most every Gasparilla since, the ingredients of the beads, the oil & Other chemicals needed to make them and then as noxious chemicals potentially leeching into the ground or waterways
3514 2018-01-25 16:40:45 Cllr R Williams says other industries that are "equally damaging" and big oil and petrol are also looking at developing alternatives. Says "it's an individual thing, if you have a big problem then withdraw your pension" #powyswebcast
3515 2018-01-25 16:40:42 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and Putin can frame Trump as well as his  sourcing, I think they probably just want to give trump the finger.
3516 2018-01-25 16:40:42 Don’t forget the solar industry workers, too!  This industry had faster growing job growth than oil until Koch brothers and Trump got their way with 30% tariffs.

3523 2018-01-25 16:39:59 It looks like toxic masculinity has gotten to coffee. “Let’s take something other cultures have been doing forever and call it BRAIN OCTANE OIL SO MANLY GRRRR”
3524 2018-01-25 16:39:39 It's a great idea.  I took traffic and transportation at BCIT decades ago (never really used it) but seem to remember product should determine mode.  With pipelines, designed for "regular" oil, they got it backward and fit product to mode - wasteful and inefficient in long run.

3534 2018-01-25 16:39:01 @realDonaldTrump I know you’re probably asleep, but I’m watching @FoxBusiness @Varneyco and Oil went over $65.00 yesterday and looks like it might go over $66.00 today. Varney acts like that’s good, but it’s not good for us, the middle class. #WeThePeople

3561 2018-01-25 16:36:07 Well. What it looks like: Tax cut, remove healthcare “tax”, bring back jobs, mining, oil production, make Corp pay taxes, give small biz tax breaks THEN the financial system collapses? Can’t be things that help Americans in long run so MUST be banks, ie #EndTheFed?

3574 2018-01-25 16:34:47 much as I dislike trump at least the Us know what they're getting. Trudeau, while taking costumed selfies with First Nations, secretly gave Enbridge (oil firm) permission to lay pipe in sacred FN territory in BC. Or research "cash for access"

He is a charming snake oil peddler
3575 2018-01-25 16:34:39 30% tariff on solar! Oh do share how we can drill for more oil! Shameful
3576 2018-01-25 16:34:16 I'm no economist, but surely the £ strong against $ and weak against the €. Is the the best of both worlds? Cheap oil, cheap exports to Europe.

3598 2018-01-25 16:31:37 Sad, you would think that in the current state of the world that there would be incentives for diversification of energy production not tariffs. Guess we should keep building more dams and drilling more oil wells, cause that seems to have done so well for us.

3627 2018-01-25 16:28:00 No the difference is you see one side of the coin only. Trudeau is more fiscally responsible than Harper ever was. Tapping out the oil sands for 10 years on a 1 industry economy put the country in the tank. It’s intelligence and compassion vs. greed & self-interest (i.e Harper)

3676 2018-01-25 16:22:16 Hi thanks for replying (again ) I thought I had looked online but I couldn't have found it now.  Is it best to get pure oil as there done different also in colour  ? Ive looked in my local chemist & spice shop for citric acid powder . Amachoor won't be the same though will it ?

3834 2018-01-25 16:06:54 This is nothing but the tip of the iceberg,in fact pilferage of the oil is already taking place in most of the places, hand in glove with the oil company officials,staff  & the thief,internal as well as external audit should be done to assess the loss of the oil through pilferage

3897 2018-01-25 16:00:38 I really like my Thieves oil in Aloe Vera gel and vegetable glycerin. It doesn't dry out my hands and the Thieves oil kills just about all those nasty bugs. Plus you can add a few drops to a diffuser or simmering pot of water and the air smells great :)
3898 2018-01-25 16:00:34 I get a shiver if I hold in my coughs too much but never a jumping or twitching. If I gotta be in a circle with a bunch of chicks geeking about jumping/twitching that shit is gonna blow my high, I'll take the oil I prolly brought and take my ass home.

Trump owes Russia so much money that he's willing to throw America under the bus

4102 2018-01-25 15:38:41 There's no shortage of crude.  More a shortage of refinery activity to artificially inflate the price.  I like going out instead of staying in because of an oil spill.  If there's no issue with more drilling, how come Florida got a pass?
4103 2018-01-25 15:38:37 Are you really proud of this? Because it looks like you created some jobs for people in other states, funded some research on how to create more problems for our children, and made some money for oil companies.  Maybe you should stick to colloquialisms.

4192 2018-01-25 15:29:57 Should be in Denton walking into my first class but instead I’m waiting for jiffy lube techs to figure out what they did wrong last week that my car is STILL leaking oil even after bringing it back
4193 2018-01-25 15:29:50 Temperatures tonight are getting as low as -17° in Pyongyang. Many families have their heating systems turned off due to international sanctions on oil & natural gas. Innocent children are going to freeze to death in this week-long cold snap over the Korean Peninsula. Stop this!

4200 2018-01-25 15:28:28 Shareholder activism is a great way to influence behavior at margins of a co’s business — e.g., asking @Nike to do away with sweatshops. But using it to change the core business of an industry — i.e., telling Big Oil to stop digging — has failed. Proof? Emissions keep rising.
4201 2018-01-25 15:28:25 Why is it that we are concerned about price-fixing when it comes to bread but not when it comes to oil?  In fact it seems to me we want the price of oil to be fixed.

4243 2018-01-25 15:23:30 late 1990s we were wondering why so many small oilfield burned down there. They saved oil for financial war.

4252 2018-01-25 15:22:36 oh boy time to burn some midnight oil!
4253 2018-01-25 15:22:32 All while the USA is stockpiling oil reserves in an attempt to drive fuel prices up. The rich get richer and we pay through our noses to get them there. So much winning!
4254 2018-01-25 15:22:29 Just buy an air conditioner and turn it up to 10. That way the snowflakes will stop melting over everything.
4255 2018-01-25 15:22:27 *global economy. Shipping things have a cost and fuel is one. 10% more decline puts oil at $70. Get ready for inflation.
4256 2018-01-25 15:22:23 30% Tariffs on Solar equipments            Are not America first, it’s a policy that proves OIL FIRST for big oil companies.

RUSSIA OIL OUTPUT 11,000,000 BARREL PER DAY FOR 2017.
MARKET PRICE US$ 50 X 11,000,000 BPD = US$ 550,000,000.
US$ 550,000,000 X 365 DAYS = US$200,750,000,000 OR US$ 200 BILLION?
US$ 200 BILLION X 10 YEARS = US$ 2,000,000,000,000 OR US$ 2 TRILLION?
4270 2018-01-25 15:20:18 Busting the Illuminati held Nikola Tesla free energy and his UFO technology to end oil's climate change ? Yes that is a question. World Leaders go away from Trump you are all worthless worms of the Illuminati.
4271 2018-01-25 15:20:15 It's better than it was - my first year of owning the house oil was $3.899 a gallon, now it's about $2.639 a gallon, I think. Last year it got down to about $1.899, but this year, we had a record stretch of temps. in the teens, prices juped up
4272 2018-01-25 15:20:14 How does airdropping a coin not make it anything but snake oil?

It is still based of zcash which is based of 0.11 codebase ... So even before you get off the ground you are 5 major releases behind bitcoin.
4273 2018-01-25 15:20:02 Like apparently the most recent attempt was a $42 million dollar offer by Disney, which is more than the value of the blocking, but Robertson wanted more because he's a crazy evangelical and it's how he pushes his snake oil

4304 2018-01-25 15:18:03 Yes and no. I think there was enough deregulation to likely add a bit more than I feel Hilary would have. Of course with trump the deregulation in this case was probably allowing mining oil next to virgin bore water underground streams or some shit

4307 2018-01-25 15:17:45 :) also it might be worth asking if they normally cook their side dish veggies in butter or oil. Because if they use only oil, you could eat the broccoli or peas or green beans from other stations
4308 2018-01-25 15:17:28 Again, if you truly cared, you'd be going after the root cause of the problem. Canada only has 36M people. We also live in an extremely cold climate. I'm not apologizing for our carbon footprint, and neither should you. Canadian oil is the most env/socially responsible. FACT.
4309 2018-01-25 15:17:27 I would say  that  all coastal states should be closed to oil drilling!
4310 2018-01-25 15:17:22 Ok, that’s not as bad as I’d previously heard. I bet pretty cars have come down since then. I know conversion can be a real pricy enterprise as well. I didn’t offer on a house because of the oil furnace. Prefer natural gas and luckily I had options
4311 2018-01-25 15:17:15 It's not usually about the entire oil company it's specific petrol stations

4323 2018-01-25 15:16:10 It was expected and nothing exceptional although positive sign as it comes from #Total. Oil companies needed waivers too from OFAC 20 years ago to go ahead with the buy backs. It's likely they will get it again. French/European diplomacy will play a role

4335 2018-01-25 15:15:13 Having a high pound against the dollar is no good for exports. Trump realises the importance of a competitive exchange rate and is allowing the dollar to slip back. Hopefully we will slip back alongside the dollar. US has oil we don't.

4435 2018-01-25 15:03:06 I say crypto snake oil because it's adding nothing, has nothing unique, and is just marketing fluff. 

What's innovative about Bitcoin Private aside from making the founders more money?

What does Bitcoin Private have to do with Bitcoin? It's a fork of Zclassic.

4445 2018-01-25 15:02:18 Growing foreign reserves is not a sign of economic growth or economic activities in Nigeria. The rising oil price is responsible.

4481 2018-01-25 14:58:57 Do you have anything indoors that needs using up?
If not I would go with roast tomato pasta: Roast cherry tomatoes and peeled garlic cloves tossed in olive oil in a hot oven for 25 minutes. Toss with cooked pasta and eat. Ingredients cost around £2.50 from supermarket own brand.
4482 2018-01-25 14:58:52 Haha hahaha,  you fucking Brits. This is exactly what I have been saying for years. But damn,  for your own government to just shit that down at you all like that.  Brutal.

One might think if he wanted to do compsci work he would not be launching shitcoin forks and doing ICOs for clones of other people's work

Also one more committee for suggesting to world economic forum.
One for advising OPEC to maintain oil price in a manner in which Arab states earn more and consumers pay less. A win win situation.

4576 2018-01-25 14:48:49 It circles back to the psychology of the Dem who goes off and works as an oil lobbyist. Or why Bill Kristol or David Frum can be so easily rehabilitated. Advancement is the ethic - advancement and power are ultimately what make a person a valuable human and worthy of respect.
4577 2018-01-25 14:48:45 Just thinking aloud! Repair/building a new refinery shouldn't take more than 2 years if a government is serious on getting its crude oil refine by itself!

4628 2018-01-25 14:43:54 Maybe, who knows. Think the negative impact from brexit will start to bite and with reduction in consumer spending demand could drop significantly. This squeeze will present a good opportunity to raise rates especially if oil prices and subsequent inflation creep up again...

4669 2018-01-25 14:39:40 Also, oil was cheap way before sanctions and it hasn’t gone down significantly after sanctions were enacted. What you’re saying can theoretically happen, but it doesn’t match up with current events.

4701 2018-01-25 14:36:26 Market will grow only slightly this year, lenders pencilled in to launch, huge competition still, inflation shld fall back, Brexit negs, lenders will absorb cost... one concern is oil prices on a nice steady increas! Just a view 
4702 2018-01-25 14:36:25 Try a wig shine. It’s like an oil spray but more about adding shine than weighing your hair down. It’s not heavy at all. Just spray it on your hands and rub it through once you straighten your hair.

4748 2018-01-25 14:31:45 We hear Mr. Creel thinks crude oil will be here only for a “limited time”. Meaning CP doesn’t consider anyone a potential “stable” customer unless they contract for 20 years or more? Seems a tad lacking in entrepreneurial acumen. #ceooftheyear

4752 2018-01-25 14:31:12 Haba! Bros it's was $24bn not $34bn every Nigerian knows that because it was stated clearly.

4755 2018-01-25 14:30:42 The R2 715HNFB, provides 3-way protection against cuts, impact and water/oil. Our low-profile TPR is so comfortable and supple, you almost don't feel it's there. The microfoam air nitrile has improved permeability and the HPPE shell provides ANSI A2 cut protection.
4756 2018-01-25 14:30:20 Finally OPEC is recognizing the IEA misleading information.However, US oil production is not among them. Saudi Arabia is on the other hand, overestimating Russia ‘s cooperation in oil market.Russia is what I call “ LIFO”;last in first out.They will pull out in June if not before
4757 2018-01-25 14:30:13 SHARE IF YOU WANT CHANGE! The oil price difference is pretty shocking, and due to the lack of pipelines and the ability to sell our oil internationally we are held at a stand still!

4770 2018-01-25 14:28:59 Those are the ones I know of. The Boycott Koch website was shut down. Main thing is they own Georgia Pacific and why so many consumer products are paper.

The oil, gas, and chemical ownership may produce products to Boycott, but hard to find. 

Koch is still a private corp.

4810 2018-01-25 14:24:45 Congrats! I've been WFPB for 5 months-my severe Lupus labs are SO LOW, My RA has gone from HIGH to Moderate! I have more energy, less pain!

4811 2018-01-25 14:24:42 Perhaps; it will surely comprise retired and recycled military officers, conmen in political garbs, angry goats unhappy with the current scheme of things as well as the oil barrons missing their subsidy allocations.
4812 2018-01-25 14:24:35 He is definitely in the pockets of the oil and coal industries!!!

4815 2018-01-25 14:24:23 The issue is still there, Indian Oil sales manager is in touch with me. The petrol pump owner is denying any such incident. I request you to check 9 Dec 2017 CCTV footage of petrol pump. I am sure he won't give you footage.

4826 2018-01-25 14:23:21 Here is a good question. On Long Island gas prices went way up last week. And so did heating oil. What's up
4827 2018-01-25 14:23:19 Why not. It´s their religion and culture. He got into office to do that. Take a look at the "good people" that went across the globe to liberate people of their oil and wealth and rape and opress the people. He has nothing to be ashamed of!

4834 2018-01-25 14:22:57 This one is a hard one though as this also applies when reversed. It's more realistic for people to find a healthy balance between the two, as it's impossible to eradicate palm oil from your diet and life completely.

4838 2018-01-25 14:22:33 Agreed. However, I’m presuming that you’re still claiming oil to b non-renewable. When science is moving toward determining oil to b both renewable & abiotic. Unless you’re real purpose isn’t about renewable, but “green”. They’re not the same thing.

4846 2018-01-25 14:21:58 @realDonaldTrump sir - no issue with the solar panel tariffs, however shouldn’t we also have higher tariffs on imported oil?  Otherwise we are incentivizing oil over solar usage by default?  Lmk
4847 2018-01-25 14:21:56 If oil was found under your back yard, why would you think some oil company owns it? You own anything under your land, oil, gas, water, gold, minerals, etc.

4876 2018-01-25 14:19:07 Thank you. This is precisely what concerns me. Venezuela will do the same: burn oil to mine coin. Agree that it’s not a bitcoin problem, but as long as jurisdictions can compete on the basis of cheap dirty energy, humans have a problem.

4971 2018-01-25 14:08:21 Why don't we just buy oil from Venezuela instead of earning the Capitalist Pigs name. Pay them in dollars. Why do we have to destroy anything that resembles goodwill? Venezuela spreads the wealth so what. We are the bad guys in that situation.
4972 2018-01-25 14:08:17 If you use valve oil from the cabinet, freakin’ put the cap back on the bottle and put it back! Or for the love of whoever is up there, at least stand the bottle upright so it doesn’t leak oil all over the counter! Geez! Freakin' slobs.
4973 2018-01-25 14:08:10 It delays the action, but doesn't necessarily stop it long term. Referring them to the Oil and Gas authority just means that somebody else takes the decision, and if the commission decide it is okay then the government can claim it's not their fault because it is independent.
4974 2018-01-25 14:08:07 We had the car at the mechanic yesterday for a routine oil change. They discovered a nail in one of the tires and had to do patch work.

4977 2018-01-25 14:07:52 The dollar is breaking to new lows.  Let's see how long it can hold an 88 handle. Oil prices just rose above $66.50, the highest level in over 3-years, and up over 50% since the July 2017 low.  The bad news for consumers is that there is no overhead resistance below $80.

5075 2018-01-25 13:57:19 What’s up with these oil/gas prices?? #BS

5179 2018-01-25 13:47:28 President Trump. Great job on tax reform. Now oil price are going to high and this will slow down our economy. Please get a handle on this issue, $50-$60 is profitable for our oil industry. Don't let speculators and Foreign enterprises control our growth.

5202 2018-01-25 13:44:43 If you're still doubting human made climate change, just remember, oil lays on top of water. Burnt oil stays above the clouds.
5203 2018-01-25 13:44:21 Wasn't it the Republicans who really pushed back against Oil Drilling in sight of land, just as their laws about not seeing Wind Turbines off shore? Now they are all for coastal Drilling. Not just Deep Oil Drilling like Deep Water Horizon?
5204 2018-01-25 13:44:11 More offshore oil and gas drilling will do NOTHING toward American energy independence. Global market and will be exported as we are already doing with our energy resources.
5205 2018-01-25 13:43:57 Emotions and business dont go well together... oil and water effect!
5206 2018-01-25 13:43:55 Did you have your oil level checked? 
5207 2018-01-25 13:43:50 When ISIS were at Turkey's borders, Ankara welcomed then with open arms, allowed them free passage back and forth, and traded them guns for their oil.
5208 2018-01-25 13:43:47 why do you hate American oil and gas businesses? #marcorubiohatescapitalism
5209 2018-01-25 13:43:32 He might have even nuked Saddam Hussein - and done God knows what after 9-11. The only limiter on them is if they have physical property - like Bushes with oil or Trump his hotels and resorts. They don't want those damaged so avoid war near them.

5212 2018-01-25 13:43:13 Had a dream I was in Armageddon. I can pretty much fly a space shuttle, and run an oil rig now.
5213 2018-01-25 13:43:09 If it was up to the Trump administration you’d all blow up the Alps and drill for oil. How can you appreciate the natural beauty of another country while Zinke and Donny plot to destroy ours with oil platforms and coal mines? #WEF18
5214 2018-01-25 13:43:08 Should have made it clear I meant $
However, since international commodities eg oil is priced in $ I don’t think it’s delusional to be happy about it.

5216 2018-01-25 13:43:00 Oil $60.00+ per barrel. No problem!!  
5217 2018-01-25 13:42:58 Gold could continue climb higher as US Dollar falls and crude oil prices climb higher, BUT if either one or both reverse course, gold will fall..
5218 2018-01-25 13:42:52 Empty treasury is a figure of speech. Do you want to wait until there is absolutely nothing in the foreign reserve? That situation will be worst than Greece. With the unprecedented income from oil within the period, Nigeria should have nothing less than $100 billion.

5224 2018-01-25 13:42:00 I think the price of oil in Aug 2016 vs today is also a factor since mining gold is an energy intensive business.  Good points in this thread today

5283 2018-01-25 13:35:00 But corporate power is weaker than state power 

that's partly why Mexico was able to nationalize their oil in 1941 when the US government didn't try to stop then

conversely, that's why the mighty United Fruit Company came crying to the Dulles brothers

It is a bit harder to do gas and oil when it is more scarce.
5322 2018-01-25 13:28:53 * where did he get $34billion?

Foreign Reserves have peaked at $40b, the highest level in about
four years, and up from $24 billion just a year ago, even though when
we came in, the price of oil had crashed woefully.

5329 2018-01-25 13:27:16 Maybe you need to stay current.  Or stop assuming you are smarter here.  Your Pres needs to as well job killer.  Big tariff on renewable energy imports?  Maybe you need a tech talk with him?  Oh yeah that Russian oil & yet unenforced sanctions.
5330 2018-01-25 13:27:14 It comes from our tax base, of which oil is a small part
5331 2018-01-25 13:27:12 Ternyata untuk hidrasi tuh emang toner+serum main peran penting. Kalo pelembap, apa aja ok asal bukan mengandung mineral oil n alkohol. Nah bukan berarti lembabin pk vco, almond oil, grapeseed salah.  Mineral oil di skincare n makeup pabrikan yg harus dihindari.

5341 2018-01-25 13:26:29 Actually sa world market man jd naga depend ang price sa oil. Regardless sa president. Pila lng man ang dungag sa excise tax 2php per liter, murag layo nman kaayo tong sa pic di nato effect sa tax.
5342 2018-01-25 13:26:21 California, knowing it's going to loose federal funding, is just looking to make up the lost revenue. Oil companies are easy pick'ens.
5343 2018-01-25 13:26:21 Great idea! Hope it tastes better second time around  My favourite way to use celeriac is in ribbons, like pasta, blanched for a minute in hot water, drizzled with olive oil, and piled high with a ragu sauce 
5344 2018-01-25 13:26:20 Hi ginger what is the coconut oil good for in the coffee? Can you please tell me . Have a great day

5348 2018-01-25 13:25:22 I’m a bot, #release the memo, have a nice day. Need oil.
5349 2018-01-25 13:25:17 Saying a govt left an empty treasury does not mean it totally empty giving the amount that is expected to be there, especially during the oil bum @ over $110 per barrel.  You people should fear God and be object for once.

5355 2018-01-25 13:24:47 Dear APC, the external reserve rose because the price of oil increased. It has nothing to do with APC policies. In fact, APC will deplete the external reserve by 2019 when electioneering campaign comes up. Mark my words.
Secondly, your increase in Megawatts is only online.
5356 2018-01-25 13:24:40 Are you so out of touch with the realities of this nation?.The deduction?.You support stoning, beheading, extremist Wahhabism,a sponsor of terrorism, the illegal attack on a defenseless nation, leading to absolute poverty..flooding the market with oil?...is your head shaking yet.

5360 2018-01-25 13:24:00 Just another bank trying to control the narrative. The world will hate a weaker dollar. Even OPEC because the US exports oil now. So it’s even cheaper to buy crude from the US.
5361 2018-01-25 13:23:54 Money coming out my pores, ran it up from the soil, when I come down off the oil, I be nonchalant on you whores
5362 2018-01-25 13:23:53 the oil on my nose provides a blinding shine.  who needs highlighter ?
5363 2018-01-25 13:23:48 After many month of chronic pain in my lower back I started using CRB oil and experienced almost instant relief !  and I was able to sleep again ! To this day, I feel my lower back is almost normal.

5367 2018-01-25 13:23:36 ほんと、名前何にしよう
5368 2018-01-25 13:23:30 I really hate it when guys over tighten the caps on 2 liter bottles. It's like, ok, I get it. You're frustrated. Why you taking it out on the Sunkist, dude? Knock that shit off. I shouldn't have to get an oil filter wrench just to drink some orange soda, mfer.
5369 2018-01-25 13:23:29 Their “backing” by oil is dubious. Are they going to have open audits? Are they going to let people redeem the petro for actual oil? Smells like an exit scam by a dying regime.

5371 2018-01-25 13:23:27 IMHO, tariffs to prevent dumping of below market priced chinese solar panels would be fine, IF there was gov support for ramping up domestic industry. Trump has not done the latter, to prop up billionaire coal/oil/gas cronies, and prevent solar from making inroads.
5372 2018-01-25 13:23:10 Comey sounds like a motivational speaker or a salesman. Somebody tell him we have had our fill of snake oil.

5378 2018-01-25 13:22:49 Oh for Frack's Sake, the Trump is hell bent on destroying solar and wind progress.   We are set to sell off US oil reserves in 2025 to pay for the corporate.   You don't want to invest in infrastructure change,  your party will just rape creation for every oil opportunity.
5379 2018-01-25 13:22:25 Saudi Arabia’s energy minister took a rare sideways swipe at the International Energy Agency on Wednesday, accusing the body of overhyping the impact of US shale growth on the oil market.

5381 2018-01-25 13:22:22 If oil prices go down doesn’t that mean there’s a surplus? Why would prices go up?

5386 2018-01-25 13:21:08 The oil situation was badly managed combined with World Bank expropriation led to their current situation.
But once again you’ve deflected the conversation away from the here &now - homelessness in the UK, typical Tory strategy deflect &avoid the real issue
5387 2018-01-25 13:21:02 Anything probably helping getting away from oil is good. I am all about getting electric cars and airplanes, but gradually since the grid we have today is not able to handle the demand to charge all cars. But I'm sure many new technologies by that time will be more efficient.
5388 2018-01-25 13:21:01 Day 4: FUCK! Just read the ingredients on my @WOOLWORTHS_SA roasted & salted luxury nuts and it contains vegetable oil. Not #whole30 compliant  I am DEVASTATED.
5389 2018-01-25 13:20:49 Yes, the charts and the new US narrative forced me to change. We have an oil expert view coming up soon (not my view).

5391 2018-01-25 13:20:08 made a mistake of adding in the chili oil

5393 2018-01-25 13:20:08 Using this rationale, all of the oil drilling that currently exists in other areas is jeopardizing “our national security interests” and “tourism.”

Can you deliver the data to support your position?

5408 2018-01-25 13:18:38 OPEC cuts are the show, US exports central to WTI increase, tight supply heavy oil, China-NW Eur less dependent on prod imports, Latin Am is the export market, Venezuela will fail. Near term price correction likely, price spike inevitable. Price upside more likely than downside.

5447 2018-01-25 13:14:52 Think about it: all we need is energy, food, water, medicine, clothing and shelter. The oil companies and the farmers can work for u Rihanna distributing essentials to Americans and ending materialism. We are a tribe of ONE.
5448 2018-01-25 13:14:51 I disagree! Not fair that the gulf of Mexico states have drilling off their shores. I don't think it would hurt to see if there is oil off other coast. Strict drilling regulations should be required if drilling is approved off other coastal areas.

5470 2018-01-25 13:12:11 I'm  looking for USO to top @ $13.50 and February to be a very weak seasonal month for oil. Will trade the inverse funds as USO tops.
5471 2018-01-25 13:12:01 I’ll stick with my oil burner then 
5472 2018-01-25 13:12:01 ごめんな迷惑かけて
5473 2018-01-25 13:12:00 Maybe this will remind the Oilers who they are playing for

5475 2018-01-25 13:11:57 Somebody just threw a bottle of omega 3 capsules at me.

5476 2018-01-25 13:11:49 and when tariffs are placed on american goods in retaliation? or worse the world decides to use the euro to trade in oil?
5477 2018-01-25 13:11:46 Listening to NPR yesterday. Climate activist are actively perusing a carbon tax on the Oil Companies in Cal. They don't understand that that tax will hurt the very base that supports them when the Oil Companies pass it on to the consumers. This Climate Hoax is just a tax plan.
5478 2018-01-25 13:11:45 I think these tax cuts definitely spur inflation in commodities like oil, and food. I think they leader to faster growth in the next 18 months but it’s filling forward growth from the 24 - 36 month period. I don’t see much impact to wages, but temporary windfalls from bonuses

5484 2018-01-25 13:11:12 We have evidence of other nationals in this country who are posed as Ghanaians and are working as locals in the oil sector. Immigration, Births/Deaths, Passport Office must verify. - Sam George (MP, Prampram) #GhParliament

5495 2018-01-25 13:09:47 Good Qs. It is speculated that Indy did not pay the entire entry fee - but idk that for sure. The stadium lease amount is also unknown as Lucas Oil isn’t a done deal yet. But I’m sure it factored into the decision making
5496 2018-01-25 13:09:42 $23 not $34. 
Jonathan depleted the reseves from near $50bn to $23bn when he left, at near lowest level to keep our ratings or keep hope alive.
Despite high oil prices Jonathan added $0 to d reserves. A shame. He spent everything. We were borrowing to pay salaries.

5502 2018-01-25 13:09:04 @ManCityCouncil  GMP advised tweeting you: City centre downhill junction of Booth St & Brown St - a diesel or cooking oil spill right across road is making road surface incredibly treacherous Walking across is like black ice- "accident waiting to happen" Thought you should know!
5503 2018-01-25 13:09:03 Started with the highest oil reserves in the world - squandered it. 'It's the yanks fault'. Classic super-convenient response. Regressive leftists never take ownership for the recurring failures of socialism.

5521 2018-01-25 13:06:24 Best intermediate trade should be DWT, oil pullback to 62-63 very likely, probably will take 2-3 weeks
5522 2018-01-25 13:06:22 Chelsea were nothing until the Abramovitch money; their success over last few years is down to that Russian money given to them in exactly the same way as City & the oil money; if you say City are plastic then so must Chelsea be as they also bought the title in the same way 
5523 2018-01-25 13:06:07 NHS is Ruk worse, employment in Ruk worse, exports in RUK worse, educational attainment in Ruk worse and recorded crime in Ruk worse.

5544 2018-01-25 13:04:33 Liberal Progressive Socio/Communist Ideologies congregate where others of like Ideologies are.  LPSCI’s tend not to fare too well in cattle country or say oil & mining country where people work
5545 2018-01-25 13:04:26 Mostly oil sludge from rig spills, but yeah...
5546 2018-01-25 13:04:22 Odd how they use coconut oil, which is primarily comprised of SFA. The main health-related argument for veganism is that SFAs are bad & that lower SFA vegan diets are therefore healthier. However, a 1 oz serving of this product contains ~6 g SFA, about the same as real cheese.
5547 2018-01-25 13:04:03 Vacuous place. Auntie is obviously chasing the oil gulf .

5564 2018-01-25 13:01:07 @cspanwj Maybe I should call Bob Deans instead to ask him how much the NRDC takes in from Putin for keeping oil prices high?
5565 2018-01-25 13:00:59 Cooking with coconut oil is better than olive oil. It has more Omega-3s and doesn’t oxidize in sunlight or high temperatures.

5582 2018-01-25 12:59:01 Solar peaks are the highest forecast so far this week at ~3.4GW, this and wind power generation at ~6GW, have taken some of the sting out of gains in the oil market. Which supported gas and power earlier this morning. #EnergyMarketReport #RenewableEnergy #oil
5583 2018-01-25 12:58:46 @morningmika Do the WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS pay taxes on the $trillions they keep STEALING and spreading around. Why isn't SEC Chairman Jay Clayton controlling these thieves? See GAS/HEATING OIL PRICES at the CCM that WALL ST. controls.

5589 2018-01-25 12:58:22 If a chef said, "I need wine to make chicken really tasty," but his boss kept on releasing money for groundnut oil, who would take the blame for the chicken not tasting really great? What is wrong with humans?

5908 2018-01-25 12:15:44 Bull Crap. Hog wash. All tax relief is doing is being sent to Big Oil Industry and its Thieves. Gas prices r rising so fast we can't keep up. Tax relief is going to Big Oil pockets and y'all say Nothing. Hello, Duh. Tax relief, Big Deal

5916 2018-01-25 12:13:45 Trying to put oil in my car and 1) I can't remember where to fill it up and 2) I've broken a nail in the process. This is why I don't do any maintenance to my car ever whatsoever.
5917 2018-01-25 12:13:42 Absolutely; not only that but these types of energy give more resources to counties, farmers, and schools. In the oil dependent counties - like Gaines county - wind and solar could make the bust times more bearable than it currently is.

6044 2018-01-25 11:50:45 Awesome to see how the notion of breakfast is changing. When I tell people that my breakfast consists of a salad (leafy greens, legumes, hemp hearts, pumpkin seeds, olive oil, etc—topped with lower fat protein and hot sauce), I get that look:  But that’s not breakfast!

6054 2018-01-25 11:49:22 To assist in funding there is 25 billion in money wire transfers to Mexico annually. That is more revenue than what they receive on oil. These transfers go from U.S. to Mexico. Add an additional fee to each one.

6075 2018-01-25 11:44:31 Here’s an idea to reduce #plasticpollution - stop buying fucking water, when you have a free and ready supply coming out of your tap. Bottled water is the biggest snake oil scam ever!
6076 2018-01-25 11:44:28 So because the malady is persistent you don't trust him, fair enough, but don't complain when you get burned by snake oil salesmen. The world is a complicated place, depression is real phenomena. Maybe there is no 'cure',

6087 2018-01-25 11:43:15 The geologist is basically a fraud like the economist. He conjured up a  concept mixing  unrelated sets of data to promote a agenda. And If enough folks fall for his BS he has it made.

6093 2018-01-25 11:42:22 Considering all the nasty shit corporations do to rise to eminence, we shouldn't equate corporate leadership with intellectual legitimacy. And we seem to afford this intellectual legitimacy to tech leaders than to, say, oil industry leaders, as if tech companies are evil-proof.

6109 2018-01-25 11:39:24 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
6110 2018-01-25 11:39:01 What is economic equality and economic justice?  Are we going to legislate economics? How would one do that? How do you determine what a “good job” is? Some of the best paying jobs are the most dangerous i.e. oil rig jobs pay about 100k.

6121 2018-01-25 11:36:48 As Africa sits parched as ever, it often reminds me of the melt water flowing into the oceans from glaciers. If that were oil flowing down those hills you can be sure theyd find a way to capture and utilize it.

6136 2018-01-25 11:32:41 My dear you can't still be using cream.  Oil is the way o.  I'm just saying sha. I stopped using cream years ago and opted for just body oil.  It gives even skin colour.
6137 2018-01-25 11:32:39 Or caster oil
6138 2018-01-25 11:32:36 And how come America can't do this? Because the oil companies want to keep us under their thumb.

6193 2018-01-25 11:26:05 level it to a parking lot for Erd's pipeline, oil from Iraq. Russia controls air over Afrin, Not sure why Syrian ally is not countering attack. Maybe diminish Kurds who want a separate country IDK. But very risky move as Erd wants Syrian land for pipeline @ all costs.

6331 2018-01-25 11:01:56 You're an idiot. In what way is he "draining the swamp"? He's head deep in bed with Goldman Sachs, Big oil, Big Pharma, the military industrial complex, and just about every other swamp creature there is. Anyone who likes Trump is simply avoiding his actions and associations.

6334 2018-01-25 11:01:23 Central Africa remains largely a resource-rich region with high dependence on oil revenues making it one of the least diversified sub-regions in Africa said Antonio Pedro.
6335 2018-01-25 11:01:20 It's can only happen if we dont spent 60 % of our budget on defence.we must invest more on  our industry and development of natural resources viz oil & gas and electricity.

6340 2018-01-25 11:00:23 #HYR I think so too. 

Last years TU oil = $55 + Aviva selling and still gapped 20% on the day and rallied 2- 2.80

This TU will be much better by all accounts, improved pricing, margins and POO flying.  Looking forward to it.
6341 2018-01-25 11:00:10 Shouldn’t there be an article in a well known magazine now - giving him some ideas of what to do instead?  Maybe not knitting - since that’s been suggested to another former Secretary of State/presidential candidate, but maybe fishing, oil painting, woodworking, wine collecting..
6342 2018-01-25 10:59:54 I notice you can't refute fact that there was NEVER an Arab fakestine state. There are 58 Muslim nations - many HUGE with oil, Jordan is over 70% fakestinian - let THAT be fakestine. Jews have 1 tiny nation, why no leave us alone? You think a 59th Muslim state will bring 'peace'?

6360 2018-01-25 10:54:05 That's  odd Turkey is  the one who have been trying to push it ... take Syrian land 30KM of it, for their pipeline. That's why all the buildings etc villages are being leveled. Destructive rhetoric to say that Tillerson proposed it. It is Turkeys dream to seize land for oil pipe
6361 2018-01-25 10:54:05 That's good news I wonder what Trump's true financial state is He's no Warren Buffet or Bill Gates as a business man He's a huckster & snake oil salesman Other people lose when his schemes fail He needs to pay the piper now Mueller may bring him to account
6362 2018-01-25 10:53:45 DATING TIP: be as shiny as possible at all times throughout a date. Glitter, chrome or at a pinch, a basic vegetable, mineral or animal oil will do.

6378 2018-01-25 10:51:06 Have already spent basically half of my salary, which was paid in this morning. Rent, medical aid, and a small assortment of groceries. Still coming: cellphone bill, the rest of the groceries, payment for our housecleaner, smokes, and petrol and oil for the month, credit card. :(
6379 2018-01-25 10:51:01 Brent Crude inching higher now at $71. Extremely surprising
It is expected that by Dec 2018, the U.S. will be the world’s biggest oil producer. This is like earth shaking event when it comes to Oil market
6380 2018-01-25 10:50:47 So the Nigerian government wants to build two new refineries in Kano & Kaduna and will source crude oil from Niger republic when we have three dormant refineries & we are exporting crude oil to other nations.
I'm honestly confused & tired of this country
6381 2018-01-25 10:50:43 MCFAs in coconut oil are used by the body as a source of fuel to stimulate metabolism. As metabolism increases so does the body’s natural mechanisms of detoxification, repair, and growth. Even the immune system is shifted to a higher level of efficiency.
6382 2018-01-25 10:50:38 そもそもオイルフィラーキャップにデカデカとOILって書いてるのに軽油を入れるのか・・・
6383 2018-01-25 10:50:34 จริง
6384 2018-01-25 10:50:25 Yeah, despite the fact that we have had the answer to the oil problem for a 100 yrs. We stole it from Real as safe when he died. And we reverse engineered the UFO's we shot down and stole their tech too. But that would have put an end 2 a lot of private piggy banks

6386 2018-01-25 10:50:09 Coconut oil is chemically very stable so it functions as an antioxidant protecting against destructive free radicals that are often generated by toxins.

6389 2018-01-25 10:49:22 MCFAs (medium chain fatty acids) in coconut oil kill disease-causing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. These microorganisms not only cause infection but also often produce toxic byproducts that are carcinogenic or poisonous.

6392 2018-01-25 10:49:13 The USA has enough oil reserves to stop importing oil from the Middle East, this is good for the world as Saudi Arabia would be forced to drop its prices to sell more oil. The cheaper the oil the better.

6398 2018-01-25 10:48:39 To remove cradle cap, try gently massaging coconut oil onto your baby’s head and leaving for some time. Simply rinse off and then use a baby brush to remove loose flakes. The coconut oil nourishes the dry skin and effectively removes cradle cap flakes.

6414 2018-01-25 10:45:20 Gosh, Grandpa.  I remember when Petroleum Economist called my forecast of declining oil prices in the 1990s "heretical".  That was 1989.
6415 2018-01-25 10:45:18 Monsieur Mangetout, between 1959 & 1997, ate some 9 tons of bikes, cars & an entire Cessna 150 aircraft - washed down with copious amounts of water & mineral oil. His preference on the pickle front is unknown.
6416 2018-01-25 10:45:14 Just returning to office after a couple of days offline. Oil strongly up at $70.71 per barrel. Ruble appreciated today also at 55.80 v USD. I should go away more often!
6417 2018-01-25 10:43:51 Most babies suffer from these painful, inflamed rashes at some stage – and it pays to have coconut oil in the nappy bag or bathroom cabinet when they do. Free from chemicals and harsh ingredients, coconut oil is a perfect barrier cream to treat nappy rash naturally.

6567 2018-01-25 10:11:33 That is a normal spike unless FIRS doesn’t do its job. The rise in oil barrel and production volume contributed. Like the thread suggested, best way to look at improvement is to look at non oil components - see if there was rigorous collection in those areas

7023 2018-01-25 08:29:46 Grace differs, this man has got no Grace for Good things. Did it surprise you oil price was at it's highest point during Jonathan and crashed when he assumed power, even though none of them had any influence on it. Grace my Friend. Grace Matters

7026 2018-01-25 08:28:32 Moreover, rising oil prices are the main cause of inflation...and PMs always follow oil prices (Silver more so than Gold)
7027 2018-01-25 08:27:40 Solar industry employs more than oil and coal operated power plants. Not the oil industry don’t be an idiot.
7028 2018-01-25 08:27:25 I mix in raw honey and olive oil into my conditioner. any time I get braids or weave I leave a leave in conditioner and oil on my hair. Direct Heat only every 6 months. Hot oil treatments BEFORE I shampoo my hair. Don’t use combs often, I detangle w/ fingers.
7029 2018-01-25 08:27:21 13. this would be you diversifying the economy from oil because you would have so much money from initiatives such as this! See you tomorrow.

Only way this happens is a huge majority election of centre Cons or huge reelection of NDP (which is pretty centre left). And then only if oil tanks again

7045 2018-01-25 08:25:05 @Mohammed_Lai Gen Obasanjo went ahead to describe '' like 1999 like 2018''. He further said that Nigeria had 35billion hanging on its head when he assumed office and also one barrel of oil was selling for 9$. how also do you respond to this. @MobilePunch @vanguardngrnews
7046 2018-01-25 08:25:00 @jesmacallan nice to see I’m not the only one burning the midnight oil... late night filming maybe? 
7047 2018-01-25 08:24:58 Ima have to try that then. Coconut oil is like suave lotion on me. I soak it right on up.
7048 2018-01-25 08:24:55 @889BrilaFM I pity dis country, even crude oil wey we get full na import we still dey import  not to talk wetin human dey consum
7049 2018-01-25 08:24:52 Yeah - the UK has more...

There is also 0% tax on the extraction of Oil.  Norway taxes at 0.9%.  In the USA they tax at 24%.

UK oil is more expensive to extract, but the non existent tax rate makes it one of the most profitable oils to extract in the world.
7050 2018-01-25 08:24:25 A 14 year old quote from some random guy on another continent from me, in a country from which beef is banned in my country due to low health and welfare standards?

That's like arguing against veganism because Indonesia cuts down rain forest for palm oil.

If only I were ballsy as @ponken I'd ask him onto the show #GoghingFit
7053 2018-01-25 08:23:56 That oil is for corporations. Not the American people. Imperialism is about enriching the few over the many. The offense aggression Military agenda has made it dangerous to be an American abroad.
7054 2018-01-25 08:23:36 I need beard oil
7055 2018-01-25 08:23:31 Then why did you impose a 30% tariff on solar power, effectively killing the industry? They employ more people than oil and gas combined. And one out of every ten employees of solar is a veteran.
7056 2018-01-25 08:23:27 He says it b/c many accuse him of it, doesn't make it true. Bob has always said he leans that way & never apologized for it, nor should he. Kids need time to adjust. Christ, did you forget the fans & critics who were questioning Puljujarvi b/c he didn't make the team? He's 19!!!
7057 2018-01-25 08:23:14 I believe that this administration is trying to lay a solid foundation for a greater Nigeria where its economy is not just dependent on oil
7058 2018-01-25 08:23:04 今日一気に納品したけどまだまだ消化できてない～～～
7059 2018-01-25 08:22:55 That’s a lie. The solar industry isn’t a fraction of the size of the oil industry. Be honest people. Use your brain.
7060 2018-01-25 08:22:53 This all happens because of human greed and persuit of material rather then spiritual goals. Why recycling plastic if the is so much raw oil waste from which new plastic can be produced from? We won't believe in climate change untill water runs out and our fridge gets empty.
7061 2018-01-25 08:22:36 We didn’t hit get goal but we were naked at the very end with oil ! Thank you all so much for hanging and to my babes who made the show happen I adore you more than anything ‘ xo @MyFreeCams

7075 2018-01-25 08:18:46 You're kind of dismissing what is happening there as we speak. I am not saying Capitalism is perfect, but I assure you most Venezuelans would trade an oil rig right now to us "Imperialists" for a fully stocked McDonald's.
7076 2018-01-25 08:18:44 Of course but what pundits and former players? Guys who played said roles will always preach their importance and many of the so-called pundits seem to go whatever direction is popular. It's an excuse. After all, didn't Lucic fix the so-called problem in the room?
7077 2018-01-25 08:18:37 If #oil is going nuts......why aren't all my oil stocks flying up?  hmmmmm?

7079 2018-01-25 08:18:26 yoooo i highly recommend switching to Pond's Cold Cream as a facial cleaner and Vanicream as a moisturizer. i had to stop using Cetaphil because i'm allergic to the macadamia nut oil in it, despite its claims about being "allergen-free"...

kind of like how a really bad car is still a car, but the oil is what makes it do its job better. oil doesnt matter if you dont have a car in the first place.
7091 2018-01-25 08:16:20 even when he says it outright on his show?
7092 2018-01-25 08:15:32 I honestly have never viewed Stauffer as being biased towards younger players but rather fair.

Oil prices change.
7116 2018-01-25 08:11:36 true but we know that Stauffer is biased towards the young players too. So that blurs things a bit as well. 

One thing rings true, when everyone is point fingers at everyone, leadership at the very top aren't doing a good enough job.
7117 2018-01-25 08:11:33 Im sure the $ of the manufacturing start up cost wont be passed to consumers and not reduced once the start up costs are covered. With that logic he'd just slap higher tax on all parts imported to make the US self sufficient? ... who else has a major stake in the oil industry?

All on Oil that was <$50/b.

7134 2018-01-25 08:08:58 Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of oil giant Total, told CNBC that international oil markets were rebalancing.
7135 2018-01-25 08:08:43 Then they can eat their oil until they wise up.
7136 2018-01-25 08:08:13 Yes but that's never what is discussed by those who complain about the apparent lack of work ethic. It's a lazy narrative and when the guy who knows more about this team essentially calls media guys out for it, that's good enough for me.
7137 2018-01-25 08:07:29 Maybe they will wait for the oil price. Sensitivity of valuation is acute. My original valuation was increased by 40% on a 20% move in oil

7140 2018-01-25 08:07:22 oh, and remember the £8.6B the Norweigans managed was with Oil beloe $50/barrel.

Just imagine what it would be when it returns to $100/b.
7141 2018-01-25 08:07:00 Saudis have been the main supporters of US's oil policy and petro dollar monetary system in the Middle East. If they were genious the Middle East would be different today.

7144 2018-01-25 08:06:22 Ridiculous, we don't want/need COPL to link us to oil news but to inform us what is going on with OPL-226. Unless this is the first attempt to pump the price prior to (yet another) placing.

7357 2018-01-25 07:31:15 FIRS declared N4tn has revenue for 2017. This is not the highest collection by the agency. Collections peaked at N5.01tn in 2012. A key element of FIRS collection is the Petroleum Profit Tax that is driven by price of oil.

7398 2018-01-25 07:22:10 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.

7425 2018-01-25 07:18:34 Interestingly, their oil for a long time was the cheapest globally. They'd subsidise it for citizens and when the oil price tumbled in 2014 they were stuffed.

7440 2018-01-25 07:15:24 #ECB day- watch us live for Decision Time 12.30pm GMT. What am watching out for: 
1-de-linkage of #rates language from Asset Purchase Program “well past horizon”
2-does APP stay open-ended “or beyond if necessary”
3-any nervousness from #Draghi about #EUR (note oil ~ negates)

7542 2018-01-25 06:54:03 Your son will never forget it.
My Dad taught my girls how to change oil in a car ( 20 yrs ago) he believed in doing it himself to save a few bucks. 
Then he taught them about plumbing, lol.
He never walked past a penny on the ground w/o picking it up. I do the same thing.
7543 2018-01-25 06:53:55 I believe that there is a correlation. Both are derived from revenue or can be classified as revenue. One is spent and the other is reserved. Reserves come from oil sales? That are taxed by FIRS?

7561 2018-01-25 06:50:25 It's not so much an issue of whether Socialism or Capitalism is better, there are imperialistic interests at stake-some can't stand not having control of that country's oil and other resources: thorium, gold, diamonds, coltan, fresh water..etc--- the empire will not give up!

7590 2018-01-25 06:42:55 Canada has the second largest amount of proven oil reserves in the world with close to 200 billion barrels within its borders.
7591 2018-01-25 06:42:46 Electric cars are quiet, nearly vibration free, they dont smell like gasoline. They dont need oil changes. They cost less to operate around 4 c per mile compared with 10 c per mile for a gasoline-powered car,depending on local costs for electricity and fuel, which often fluctuate
7592 2018-01-25 06:42:30 CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES is showing -1.1M and WTI is rising. Now traded at 66.10 USD per barrel. GOLD is rising further, now traded at 1,365 USD per Tr.oz.
7593 2018-01-25 06:42:23 Are you really trying to sell this snake oil?  There is likely very little correlation.  No corporation churns out radical changes regarding wages and bonuses in a 6o day period.  You are out of touch.

A number of oils actually, 
NOT THE newer ones though
7611 2018-01-25 06:39:32 We also lost the Argyll oil field under Labour and some good people. Jack loved war.
7612 2018-01-25 06:39:31 @JustinTrudeau why should counties like Saudi Arabia make billions selling oil to USA, Europe and China but Canada which has Human Rights. Rule of Law and stricter environmental protections make nothing because of dumb regulations MAKE CANADA COMPETITIVE AGAIN.
7613 2018-01-25 06:39:18 That's okay - if $EURUSD wants to rip higher... I own plenty of #FX against the U.S. Dollar... Long $GBP $JPY $AUD $NZD $CAD $MXN ...also long #commodities like #Gold $GC_F & #Oil $CL_F. If you're right about Euro, all those trades will cover it & more.
7614 2018-01-25 06:38:54 Lmaoo. We'd switch to the style of one man on IG. Promoting herbal remedies e.g: rub palm oil on your belly and lie in the sun to 'melt' fibroids. 
7615 2018-01-25 06:38:35 We need oil colony in Nigeria Delta too
7616 2018-01-25 06:38:32 Where is your national pride? Rise man! Rise! Mass immigration be reversed as mass deportation; straight back to Libya and build them a new city with oil money. Demand it; shut the country down; but don't figgin lay down! @kthopkins @nigel_farage
7617 2018-01-25 06:38:27 really nothing wrong with fat, but the extra carbs? I make my own dressing with 18 yr aged basalmic vinegar and high end olive oil.
7618 2018-01-25 06:38:25 That's because we've been in thrall to the USA & petroleum & oil since 1950s Trams around Victoria - Bendigo Ballarat Geelong - all discontinued except for tiny tourist tram tailway services across rural Victoria discontnued The car is worshipped as an idol Freeways crawl on

7624 2018-01-25 06:36:56 Puerto Rico's power plants run on oil.
7625 2018-01-25 06:36:56 True but Akram's point is that Turkey allows porous border and oil trade but does not orchestrate or direct fund/arm ISIS. It was foolish nonetheless because ISIS caused YPG PKK to prosper with US arms/$ they get to fight ISIS.
7626 2018-01-25 06:36:51 Nah but seriously vitamin e oil works good for scars and so does aloe vera but (I’m going to sound like a fucking dickhead here) drinking water hella helped my scars fade + changing my pillow cases often

7632 2018-01-25 06:35:39 Oil in 2016 was as low as 46 USD. When you average it out its well below 70 and remember it was at 100usd at some point. So your point didn't take into account the average price
7633 2018-01-25 06:35:22 Public opinion is perceived by media and newspapers!

7636 2018-01-25 06:34:22 Make Canada Competitive Again. @JustinTrudeau Reduce regulation on oil sector so we can take advantage of increasing prices and growing demand in China, India, Europe and good ol USA trillions of dollars could come back to Canada.
7637 2018-01-25 06:34:11 I'm still surprised some ppl still put credence on these "My friends cousins sister talk to so and so" stories.
7638 2018-01-25 06:34:10 @notifypdx hello, the garbage retrieval device in our neighborhood dropped an oil duece in our front yard. The clean up is not ok. What do I do?
7639 2018-01-25 06:33:24 Religion needs to get out of our politics. Period. The Moral Majority came in, Republicans gave them lip service and a little bit of power, and they have taken over. As sure as big oil, the NRA, big pharma and others. Be gone with them.

7643 2018-01-25 06:32:51 unfortunately, you are correct...we never will know
7644 2018-01-25 06:32:30 ...and how much since then, also remember oil as at yesterday is $70/ barrel

7650 2018-01-25 06:31:45 Manchester City have proven that you do not have to be in debt to be successful. As for oil club? Every person today who fills up their car, I say god bless them because they are supporting Manchester City.  Whilst you ‘consume’ from a highly leveraged US franchise in huge debts
7651 2018-01-25 06:31:38 Haha. Ban everything from A-Z and u call this serving ? Petrol prices at all time high even when crude oil prices are all time low and US dollar slumping ? And who rules RAJASTHAN ? And their Chief Minister said that Padmavati wont be screened. educate urlsf Bhakt.

*Excess crude account now @ $40 bl

*Govt was even requesting to barrow some money 2 buy arms 

*No subsidy, no social security, no salary @ St level, nothing

7655 2018-01-25 06:30:55 I'm with you on the sentiment but coal and oil combined is totally false
7656 2018-01-25 06:30:55 After sorting to take what's suitable, I'd just soak in plain water with tea tree oil and leave it to dry. The rest will be freecycled or leave by the recycling bin

7665 2018-01-25 06:29:29 -cool with both sides of myself now which is lovely and nice but manifests in him calling me to talk about changing the oil in my car and then going OH I LOVE YOUR PICTURE BUDDY BOY! YOU LOOK LIKE A MODEL WELL HECK! which I don't know how to respond to
7666 2018-01-25 06:29:16 Still trying to figure out why summer got olive oil in the shower..
7667 2018-01-25 06:28:58 Spot on. I saw a 5 yo recently who got a hold of the parents Vape pen. Oil concentration unknown. Poison control had serious concerns. Kid was hungry.
7668 2018-01-25 06:28:38 Reading Turrini‘s blog and Merc is apparently not worried about the 2018 season. They think they can easily win it (realibility, new oil regulation etc.). Let‘s all hope and pray that they get a bad awakening because I don‘t think the sport will survive another domination year 
7669 2018-01-25 06:28:29 Ive had enough. Someone buy me a word or phrase and i will find the first big cum of the ocean on an oil rig.

7672 2018-01-25 06:27:48 Canada has trillions $ worth of natural resources but government regulations make cost too high so companies can't profit with low oil prices and they leave meanwhile authoritarian regime line their pockets with our opportunity losses.

7674 2018-01-25 06:26:53 We served roasted fingerlings (confit in oil first, then high heat roasted with chili and lemon and garlic)... So not anti potato, just anti fries. I find them lazy, and they take up to much fryer space/cook at different temperatures.
7675 2018-01-25 06:26:16 I want to compliment  @realDonaldtRump  for being the world's greatest snake oil salesman. The best ever!
7676 2018-01-25 06:25:59 At least 600bn was borrowed before 2015 to pay salaries. @NOIweala can attest to that. Note during an oil boom
7677 2018-01-25 06:25:31 Sign them to contracts, and sit some of our "star" players...
7678 2018-01-25 06:25:16 they did not want it fixed, it was struck by lightning and i think that was historical/sentimental to the good folk of hill valley, or they were too busy spending their money creating wars to steal oil, land, resources

Petrol -Jan 2018 - Rs 80 per litre (crude 68)

Excise from oil products - 540,000 crores , which is 65% of total excise revenues and atleast half of this is profit to government. and then we talk about reforms

7708 2018-01-25 06:19:20 The significant speculative positions in the oil and financial markets seem to be spilling over into the carbon market. Options volumes seem to support this idea.

7716 2018-01-25 06:18:26 Energy burst is nice, which I'm now reading is a common thing with coconut oil supplementation, but it wasn't welcome before bed. I'm also at the induction point where I'm shivering cold, even under my covers. It's going to be an interesting couple of months.
7717 2018-01-25 06:17:51 Also, Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels, crippling the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. His order will cause the loss of at least 23,000 American jobs this year. So much for jobs jobs jobs.

7719 2018-01-25 06:17:46 It’s a pity oil prices are rising... Even with a strengthening Rand we won’t get nice petrol price cuts.
7720 2018-01-25 06:17:16 In essence we can expect an improved collection this year given the current price of oil. The price of oil those years that oil hovered around $40-50 per  barrel wasn't as much as what was collected now!

7724 2018-01-25 06:16:07 This weeks readings discussed the various types of natural disasters and how they are caused, frequency of occurrence, & how even we are complicit in certain natural disasters like earthquakes due to fracking for gas and oil. #HPM_EM
7725 2018-01-25 06:15:59 To make a better comparasion ,I think the data should be disagregated by oil based vs all other sundry taxes.There should also be data for total oil revenue accrued during the year this would give a better picture of progress made of any.

7727 2018-01-25 06:15:17 Startup builder + coconut oil enthusiasts are a very valuable demographic
7728 2018-01-25 06:15:12 The means justify the ends. Higher oil prices by any means necessary.

7737 2018-01-25 06:13:34 #178177 reason why i love Dan:

He never judges my native food eating habits. I eat quaq, maktak, caribou, etc all the time. I eat w my hands, suck patiq out bones, and dip everything in seal oil.

He says he loves when i eat nikipiaq because I’m the happiest and it’s true! 
7738 2018-01-25 06:13:31 im in
7739 2018-01-25 06:13:30 Me too. 
I only got out twice last year.
~10km to warm up the oil for a change and ~40 km to a friend's house and back.
Wasn't worth the registration or the insurance last year...

7856 2018-01-25 05:54:54 Brent oil prices hit $71 per barrel on 24th Jan for the first time since 2014 as the #dollar continued to weaken.
7857 2018-01-25 05:54:04 Into the frying oil? 
7858 2018-01-25 05:53:54 @michellemungall we need more refining capacity in BC esp. with Parkland situation (which I just found out about)  Shipping crude oil out and importing refined products back isn't all that "green." We should also be encouraging nat. gas in mining etc. Use our resources ourselves.

7864 2018-01-25 05:53:35 @TheMandyMoore your fuzzy baby might be over grooming due to pain/arthritis. Mine is doing the same in the same spot. Vet recommended joint care along with grain free food. This year we were able to add cdb oil to their diet too. Good luck

7866 2018-01-25 05:53:33 I read a theory earlier that the salt kraken thing is just local legend and the Stilt is actually an old oil derrick built into a temple, with the defunct oil well now serving as the Sacred Well. Makes sense if the salt desert is a former ocean

7882 2018-01-25 05:51:50 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
7883 2018-01-25 05:51:39 Then you must not have been on ssdi for very long. The COLA is determined by the CPI. In recent years oil prices have had the biggest impact. The government doesn’t come up with a number, it’s based on the CPI, all the time.

7886 2018-01-25 05:51:16 put in coconut oil before bed & leave it overnight and wash ur hair the next day, and only wash ur hair for once a week so u don’t dry it out and try not to use heat on it

7888 2018-01-25 05:51:01 You'd think that after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill people would understand the dangers. What's going on in the South China Seas proves stupidity runs rampant and Trump has gone beyond stupid.

7892 2018-01-25 05:50:20 You will not risk a repeat service or miss an oil/tyre change as such a system will give you a heads-up—minimizing downtime and frustration...
7893 2018-01-25 05:50:03 Oil industry has lost a lot of engineering and geoscience talent since the price crashed. Old timers have given up, and few are hiring senior people back yet. I suspect there will be more oopsies in the coming years as poorly designed wells corrode.
7894 2018-01-25 05:49:55 Price of oil rose again today.  I continue to expect U.S. supply to pick up, replenishing stockpiles in the process.  Prediction -- the rally in oil won't last much longer.#orIcouldbewrong
7895 2018-01-25 05:49:54 This is all about promoting oil and coal.  It has NOTHING to do with protecting American workers and industry!

7916 2018-01-25 05:46:26 I got off antidepressants because I learned that pharmaceuticals (& Western medicine) was created by the oil industry to diversify the oil barrens profits. It's a racket. Instead of a diet and clean food/water, they'll drug you into a vicious cycle of more malaise and drugs.
7917 2018-01-25 05:46:24 if i may, do you have any counts/perspectives on oil? bull move but C.O.T. data suggests that most or all or many are long already.

7987 2018-01-25 05:33:47 The only reason coal would come back is if Trump imposes tariffs on clean energy, which would cost us millions of jobs. Doesn't sound like a great strategy to me. More people are employed in solar power than coal and oil combined.

7989 2018-01-25 05:33:33 there is this oil treatment.... you mix a few and within a week should be back. it’s on youtube I think! like Tea Tree Oil, Coconut oil... and sum else!
7990 2018-01-25 05:33:17 One of the many reasons the fucking moron @realDonaldTrump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar, which employs more than coal and oil combined.
7991 2018-01-25 05:33:00 Saudi Arabia will soon begin issuing tourist visas, opening up one of the last frontiers of global tourism — a sector touted as the desert kingdom’s “white oil” — as it steps up diversification efforts to wean itself off its crude oil dependence.

 I live in Arkystan and am very savvy to all things Huckabee. If he ever did really believe in anything, he sold it long ago
8001 2018-01-25 05:31:15 It’s all about the type of products you’re using, I use pore filling oil stopping primer, STAY AWAY from any type of foundation that says “glow” “dewy” I use maybellines matte+poreless foundation and I always use a finishing powder all over my face and use a mattifying spray

8013 2018-01-25 05:29:19 WOAH! Ginalingan ni Ate. Fight lang. go lang. The words don't need to make sense all the time as long as you understand yourself. The best control is when you don't mix work with pleasure. Its like mixing water and oil..eventually they go their separate ways.

Oil on boil, will stay like that for a while. Which pushes inflation up.
Also means Indian Govt ends up borrowing more. Which means more inflation.
This will suck the liquidity and will affect stock markets.

8077 2018-01-25 05:18:15 Absolutely true; hell just the exploitation of oil speculation could chalk up to this..

Which is why we regulate, and why they don't want us to..

Would life really be so hard if they simply understood that you can't sell snake oil to the dead?

8088 2018-01-25 05:14:55 "solar employs more people than coal and oil combined." That's for Electric power generation. When you lump in "oil" with no context it's very misleading and reduces credibility. Regardless, I'm with you that the move is idiotic. But you need to be more specific or face backlash.

8145 2018-01-25 05:07:24 Coal is more expensive. Lost demand when Nat-Gas became cheaper & demand declined steadily as the other power became cheaper. Freedom means our tax dollars aren’t subsidizing coal & oil co. You based your argument on a false premise. I’ve actually worked in a mine, have you?

☞Total number of Solar Energy Jobs in U.S. = 260,077

☞Total number of Coal Jobs in U.S. = 76,572

Trump is taxing the Solar industry at 30% while giving money to coal industry.

Why?

Because Russia hates Green Energy. It kills the market for their only export: OIL

And all the land. And give them all your houses.
Because they want it more than you do.
8222 2018-01-25 04:54:27 Besides, energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia both tried to downplay any concern over the impact that US #shale production growth, as a result of higher oil prices, might have on taking away their market share.

my day was fine, i managed to study a bit besides being tired,  how was yours?? //hugs how is work going?
8290 2018-01-25 04:44:19 The oil is for the USA. The cost of gas, heating oil will go down because we won't pay OPECs prices.
8291 2018-01-25 04:44:18 i can’t wait to experiment with some oil blends.
8292 2018-01-25 04:44:09 Bath bombs, oil bath bar, ocean salt scrub  thanks luv
8293 2018-01-25 04:43:53 25 billion a year - more than their oil industry.
8294 2018-01-25 04:43:49 went to ross for a hoodie & left with rose oil, turmeric face mask, a tube top, a t-shirt & conditioner. no hoodie. ross gets me everytime
8295 2018-01-25 04:43:38 Same. I grabbed a 1/2lb pack trying to save $ and ended up losing. Losing potency is one thing but rancid oil may cause cancer or so I heard. So I'm going to stay safe and toss the pack.
8296 2018-01-25 04:43:24 People try to kill me with their cooking and my allergies. 

Seriously yall... 

Just don't use Olive Oil or Dairy; THANKS IN AD-FREAKING-VANCE
8297 2018-01-25 04:43:17 Whenever I fly YVR—>YEG, it seems I meet someone smart who works in mining, oil and gas, or clean energy with a practical, no-nonsense style I find refreshing.

8300 2018-01-25 04:42:52 I love peppermint halo from saje! Works wonders. If I have a migraine and don’t want I get the Tylenol or have no oil I will lay in a dark room and drink a lot of water with a cold cloth.
8301 2018-01-25 04:42:52 Thank you n,., n . Worked on it for a while. I was late getting the last piece done.

I can see why you say it kind of looks like a oil painting.

Mhmm not sure what technique that would be. Just draw as a hobby.
8302 2018-01-25 04:42:36 honestly, it worked (along w cederwood and lavender oil in ur mascara) ;)
8303 2018-01-25 04:42:25 I'd prefer nurse or Russell on other half wall instead of 19. Can take a good one-timer. Why cant the oil have two defenders on the power play? Multiple shooters makes it unpredictable
8304 2018-01-25 04:42:24 I.hate to even have to go here but since none of u will here goes former Vice President the things that come to the surface of your alleged activities starting with your complicity with 9 11 false flag to stealing Iraq's oil by u and Haliburton makes me sick.Hope to c u n GITMO
8305 2018-01-25 04:41:59 Charge Mexico for all government costs & benefits for non citizens including health, education, welfare, law enforcement. Retroactively. If they run out of dough we'll take oil &gold
8306 2018-01-25 04:41:53 Less than 10 minutes in a very hot pan with a tablespoon of olive oil
8307 2018-01-25 04:41:48 tea tree oil smells like toes
8308 2018-01-25 04:41:43 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
8309 2018-01-25 04:41:35 We go back a long time.. we've seen the Oil at their greatest and we've been through two very dark times with this team.. but this just seems to be the hardest to stomach.  After everything we've been through and then to be gifted McDavid and now this? #tiredtoo  x100
8310 2018-01-25 04:41:29 ใจบางไปหมดเมื่อเห็นลูกยิ้ม
8311 2018-01-25 04:41:24 I planned on using my oil diffuser to wake up rn but instead it’s putting me to sleep
8312 2018-01-25 04:41:13 It helped me a lot, I was going through this phase where everything would make me break out but with this face wash and the Vitamin E oil everyday/night, it’s cleared it up.
8313 2018-01-25 04:41:11 ~I look up when I hear a door open~ Hey, Lu! I'm heading out now. This baby is top priority. ~I hurry to the waiting area, cleaning off some oil~ I'll be right back. Gotta get my jacket and purse.
8314 2018-01-25 04:40:41 I'd start an empire like Rockerfella and Rothschild family web success generation to generation own (retails, universities, diamonds mines, oil & petrol etc) 
8315 2018-01-25 04:40:39 #grownish Can someone who loves Trevor Jackson get that nigga some beard oil. The patchiness needs to be stopped
8316 2018-01-25 04:40:39 i can’t believe how much my skin texture has improved since i started rubbing down with vitamin e oil every night
8317 2018-01-25 04:40:24 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
8318 2018-01-25 04:40:23 Biblically speaking I'm a virgin, 
"why does this matter?" You ask
The answer is simple, at work I'm able to bless our regular olive oil to become extra virgin olive oil
8319 2018-01-25 04:40:16 Shea Butter and Tea Tree Oil is so 
8320 2018-01-25 04:40:16 Three things I've found to be the most essential and beneficial: breast milk, coconut oil, and wine
8321 2018-01-25 04:40:15 Castor oil on eyelashes for days!
8322 2018-01-25 04:40:10 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
8323 2018-01-25 04:40:08 Even drenched in oil those eye brows stay shit
8324 2018-01-25 04:39:53 Its not solars time to shine so to speak. But it will be. I know alternative rss, the economics surrounding them & as the cost of oil based energies rise solar &/or other alt energy sources will have their demand & supply will follow in this case.
8325 2018-01-25 04:39:27 ok google, exactly how much castor oil can i put on my lashes before i go blind
8326 2018-01-25 04:39:10 You know what sounds bomb? Pizza  with white sauce , chicken , & mushrooms! Oh and of course some buffalo wings with ranch & garlic oil dip. Lol  #fatty
8327 2018-01-25 04:39:09 I also decided not to order any more Clean It Zero. I decided months ago that my next 1st cleanser/oil cleanser would be the Heimish All Clean BUT then I saw this on sale and couldn’t resist. I love all this iLLi.
8328 2018-01-25 04:39:02 Oil hits Dec 2014 high on dollar weakness, decline in US crude inventories. @SakinaKamwendo #AMLive
8329 2018-01-25 04:38:36 just found out an oil change for my car is $90....... drive a “high-end luxury car” they said.....
8330 2018-01-25 04:38:15 Buy Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, target Rs 224: Kunal Bothra
8331 2018-01-25 04:38:05 I take chlorella & also this time of year my flax seed oil tabs are indispensable to avoid my joints getting achey <3 also as someone who doesn’t coffee anymore having a shot of apple cider vinegars not my fave but I will do it in the mornings sometimes to slap myself awake lol
8332 2018-01-25 04:38:00 @charlesadler  We need to get the best price for our oil..?..
8333 2018-01-25 04:37:46 Could Saudis be manipulating the price of oil to increase the value of they're IPO?
8334 2018-01-25 04:37:40 They keep sinking deeper everyday  this isn't even digging for oil anymore
8335 2018-01-25 04:37:25 What happened the last time we decided to cut off a countries access to Oil and shipping? Oh, that’s right...the attack on Pearl Harbor. This will go well.
8336 2018-01-25 04:37:04 あざすあざす＾＾
8337 2018-01-25 04:37:01 This is nothing except holding hands with the oil industry. Money beats the environment. A true Trumpism.
8338 2018-01-25 04:36:55 @realDonaldTrump: All schools should be CLOSED now!!!!!!!!!. We can quietly school our children at home.  They should get a lamp filled it  with coconut oil and  Just like the olden days. light it. They could use the regular lite during the day.
8339 2018-01-25 04:36:14 หนงหนง...ลู๊ก
8340 2018-01-25 04:35:27 How a 150ft tunnel was used to pilfer oil from IOC pipeline: Excessive gas pressure had led to the blast. The cops…
8341 2018-01-25 04:35:23 You know, I'm kinda alright with a tariff on #Solar panels from afar.
But the oil companies should lose their special treatments from the states, and it should be given to solar companies.

#Trump
8342 2018-01-25 04:35:17 That is true for sure. But will be even worse for solar industry - investment vs payback model no longer makes sense, so people won't purchase. Negative impact on jobs, and negative impact on enviornment. Move by Trump is beyond stupid - obviously driven by oil donors.
8343 2018-01-25 04:35:16 Are we seriously allowing this to continue. For heaven’s sake people, wake up.  Check the facts. It’s time to use Canadian oil and gas. We are currently selling Cdn oil & gas at a discount to US and then we turn around and buy oil from them at market rate. WTF!!!
8344 2018-01-25 04:35:04 I'm trying to figure out by what metric we're winning anything. 1st in guns per 100 residents, 1st in prisoners, 1st in oil consumption, 1st in total crimes, 14th last in healthcare cost. We could be doing better at so many things if you stopped worrying about your stupid wall.
8345 2018-01-25 04:34:52 Lmao u need some body oil w/ that B? 
8346 2018-01-25 04:34:29 ...Oil is control. Salt increases the mortality rate of all biological species. Salt melts ice, which is water, just imagine what salt does to human anatomy over time. Honest people should learn to lie, liars should learn to be honest....
8347 2018-01-25 04:34:18 How PM @narendramodi gave Davos a new global narrative with India at its heart? 

1. The Chinese president, who was the plenary speaker at Davos in 2017, brought his own brand of snake oil. Xi who told them globalisation was not dead, it had a new home in Chinese consciousness.
8348 2018-01-25 04:34:13 I love the coloring style on this ^_^ It looks like an oil painting, and it still has this kind of relaxed sketchy-ness to it (There are probably appropriate technical terms for these things, but I don't know them) Keep it up!
8349 2018-01-25 04:34:10 撃てる
8350 2018-01-25 04:34:09 LACI GOT ME AN ESSENTIAL OIL DIFFUSER FOR CHRISTMAS I’M FUCKIN CHUFFED
8351 2018-01-25 04:33:53 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

8357 2018-01-25 04:33:04 David Frum you are one of the most shameless promoters of oil wars on the planet today. @JesseLaGreca you know this guy is trash, don't rehab him by bouncing his Tory concern trolling

8359 2018-01-25 04:32:55 I thought Dems dont like reforming CEQA. Last Democrat that was going to reform CEQA jumped ship & went 2 work 4 big oil #Rubio #Chevron
8360 2018-01-25 04:32:51 The castor oil I ordered just came and I'm so excited to see if it actually makes me eyelashes grow  bc mine are so short and thin 
8361 2018-01-25 04:32:51 Congratulations for the news guns and lets oil the old guns they ain't firing that good anymore.
8362 2018-01-25 04:32:45 Oesterle and Pitlick. Chi let them go for nothing. Exactly what type of players oil need right now.
8363 2018-01-25 04:32:38 Buy Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, target Rs 224: Kunal Bothra
8364 2018-01-25 04:32:33 I just wish people would see that every field you can go into is dangerous. There is always the unknown. Why should we shut down oil fields leaving a shit ton of people in a bind when your basketball career could kill you just as well. People are so small minded
8365 2018-01-25 04:32:32 The more expensive oil, the bigger the incentive to move to renewable. A solar panel on your house lasts 20-25 years. And in Belgium you can rent them. You can also move them to another home, you have battery storage for the night.
8366 2018-01-25 04:32:07 coco butter and coconut oil are my fav
8367 2018-01-25 04:31:41 Thank You Trump & Corporation-Oil- Petroleum-Coal Friendly E P A Director Scott Pruitt For ALL Of Their Dergulations For Environmental Levels & Protections !!

8374 2018-01-25 04:31:07 Oil industry asking for it.
8375 2018-01-25 04:31:07 Your 30% tarrif on solar panel is a huge job killer!  Ridiculous!  Stop yielding to big oil and coal! They are not our future and employ many thousands fewer than solar & wind.
8376 2018-01-25 04:31:05 In no context whatsoever is trading RNH worse than trading McDavid.

8380 2018-01-25 04:30:24 Do you even think about the policies you make? Great job on the solar panel tariff. I'm sure it helps the oil and gas industry, but Mr. Job Creator, you fucked up again, Going to hurt Red States and cost at least 23,000 jobs. #LOSERTRUMP

8382 2018-01-25 04:30:03 Every single night I put lavender in our oil diffuser and every night Travis says "oh what oil is this?" "You switched up the oils tonight" "ooo we got a new oil tonight" but it's literally always lavender.
8383 2018-01-25 04:29:27 are you actually calling yourself an adult because you paid for an oil change for your car???? Yo I've been doing that since I was 16 and can still always afford my nails. Get your finances straight before you claim to be an "adult" when ya too busy creeping on a strangers snap
8384 2018-01-25 04:29:09 Previous govts had to deal with a global depression. This govt had the bonanza of unbelievably cheap oil. So let's not go there.  Just the bare fact remains: we are now growing SLOWER than the average for 30 years. Despite rejigged GDP methodology. That's appalling. Bye for now.
8385 2018-01-25 04:29:00 Finally got some Bio Oil
8386 2018-01-25 04:28:50 They ran out of body oil in the budget?

8388 2018-01-25 04:28:38 Body oil is so much better than lotion.
8389 2018-01-25 04:28:31 According to who? You pull these stats from where? Generally, credibility is gained by citation. I call BS
8390 2018-01-25 04:28:26 @dpradhanbjp Petrol/Diesel prices did not fall when the global prices fell in past? PSU Oil companies made their profit then and now too when prices are higher. Why loot common citizen? @PMOIndia

8404 2018-01-25 04:25:42 Did you try the oil stuff?
8405 2018-01-25 04:25:39 Plus they need a war in the MidEast to create a shortage of oil giving cover to lift sanctions and allow Putin to pump more oil. The shortage will also spike barrel price. Putin and pals (Trump,Tillerson et al) rake in the bucks.
8406 2018-01-25 04:25:38 Don't @ me but some of y'all wanna jump through hoops to convince me that Chad from alpha omega 3 fish oil is hubby material cause there's a chance that he MIGHT mature into a functioning adult
8407 2018-01-25 04:25:35 Today I tried “oil pulling”... long story short I melted coconut oil in my mouth and swished it around for 20 minutes...
8408 2018-01-25 04:25:24 My dog somehow got ahold of my coconut oil and ate all of it.
8409 2018-01-25 04:25:14 Thank God!! Its the only thing that cleans my hubbys work clothes!! He works in a machining shop and gets oil/grease and they work the best!
8410 2018-01-25 04:25:03 i just used a lush bath melt for the first time and now i’m covered in oil and glitter  #idontknowhatiexpected
8411 2018-01-25 04:24:58 the tariff thing was really to sabotage the solar industry. the biggest US solar companies are owned by the large oil companies that have been trying to undercut them to boost coal/oil which is higher profit products.
8412 2018-01-25 04:24:42 That's cool! I competed in monochromatic drawing, oil/acrylic painting, choir, and different drama pieces. That's one part of high school I miss

8416 2018-01-25 04:24:19 I hope you didn’t pay for it! That’s awful! Use some coconut oil on for an hour to help it.
8417 2018-01-25 04:24:04 Yeah sex is cool and all, but have you ever ripped your cannabis oil vape pen inside a UC Davis dorm bathroom then walked out on campus high as fuck??

8452 2018-01-25 04:18:40 For me, I realised my face was dry and I was dehydrating it out too much so I use facial oils now. Emu oil & marula oil are fantastic for healing. I had two recent acne vulgaris and the scars are much lighter already. iHerb should have some inexpensive ones. #BTSLoveMyself
8453 2018-01-25 04:18:38 Not to mention the 30% tariff he's just decided to place on imported solar panels, which move is projected to cause the loss of at least 23,000 jobs nationwide. President So Much Winning With Coal And Oil strikes again!!

Now we have profoundly ignorant rants by disgruntled people who bought the GOP snake oil and are looking to scapegoat the closest “other” they find. Bye bye USA as we knew it.
8469 2018-01-25 04:15:57 Well then we should take all government subsidies away from oil and gas companies I think that will be fair, don’t you think?

8476 2018-01-25 04:14:08 Not to mention that solar employs more people in US electricity generation than oil, gas and coal combined. 374,000... this stupid unnecessary tariff jeopardizes all of them. The tariff is also a  to big oil. Right Mr Tillerson?

8480 2018-01-25 04:13:57 He doesn't care about the middle class, just the 1%. Also, it behooves him to use his office to destroy solar because he's invested in oil. Emoluments.

8513 2018-01-25 04:09:43 Well....it's true that there are 375,000 solar employees. And true.... that's double the amount of oil, natural gas, and coal workers. However, it's also true that the Solar Industry accounts for only 0.6 % of total energy consumed today. #Solyndra

8628 2018-01-25 03:50:01 Govt recently lowered its economic growth forecast for 2017-18 to 6.5 per cent, and there is reason to be concerned. Growth dropping to 5.7% and 6.3% in, respectively, 1st 2 Qs, when oil prices were roughly half of what they were in 2014, is a sharper decline than expected.

8771 2018-01-25 03:30:42 2015 was a bad year for the market mainly due to global issues: Greece's debt, plummeting oil prices, and China's economic issues were a big part of it.  Domestically, everyone was speculating on when/if the Fed was going to raise interest rates, but then, that's nothing new.

8806 2018-01-25 03:27:12 I wasn’t familiar with how they’re made! Funny. Googled & it looks like the fish is cooked and the oil that runs off is used. I’m assuming it’s purified and detoxed first. Salmon aren’t high enough on the food chain to worry about toxicity too much. Unlike tuna for example.

8835 2018-01-25 03:22:20 Speaking of the lee incident... I've been thinking of a way to prove when you achieved a run.

Is that why Trump wants to promote oil spills, by drilling for oil along all our coastal shores, except where he has property?

9060 2018-01-25 02:48:45 Appears to be an attempt at killing the US solar industry. Keep out less expensive and probably inferior Chinese product, thus raising prices for consumers and putting around 23,000 installers out of work (MAGA!). Tillerson and others entwined in big oil. Big win for them.
9061 2018-01-25 02:48:38 We live in a carbon cycle. Oil is sequestered carbon. This is not rocket science. It’s pretty basic. The burning of millions of tons of sequestered carbon is impacting that cycle.

9072 2018-01-25 02:46:33 The market peaked in 2012 with 2.7m new cars. We are back to pre 2009 levels, not pre-2014. The % rates on car loans have been falling due to govt support. The new sales also include cars sold to the govt agencies - police, etc - sold for cash. It is all about the oil price.

9102 2018-01-25 02:43:12 If you think money is the problem here, you'd be right, but you're barking up the wrong tree. You don't become a scientist to get rich. Tillerson's exit compensation from Exxon alone was more than all climate scientist salaries combined and then some. Denial is oil's M.O.

9118 2018-01-25 02:42:07 Ummm... Your facts are way off. Hundreds of thousands are employed in the oil and gas industries alone.  Solar would only make sense if the panels were domestically sourced, but I'm betting upwards of 90+% come from China.
9119 2018-01-25 02:42:05 Global Cues: Oil Prices Rose To Their Highest Level Since December 2014 Overnight
9120 2018-01-25 02:42:00 China spent last summer co-opting black culture and then decided it was not for them all while owning 40% of the Congo's oil and more.

So are they going to give up those resources or nah?
9121 2018-01-25 02:41:49 These tariffs are a horrible idea. Unless monies and incentives are to be made available that will put sustainable energy products to the forefront empowering companies here in the US to take the lead then many many thousands of jobs will be lost. Big Oil is not the answer here.

9125 2018-01-25 02:40:48 Just added a massive Tariff to solar power generation. Will lead to tens of thousands of lost jobs this year. Solar power employs more people than Oil and Coal combined in the US.
9126 2018-01-25 02:40:45 Tack on increased electric bills for customers of utilities who still will have to purchase foreign panels in the years before these plants are built and begin operations.  Tariff will bring solar KwHr cost closer to oil/coal -- just what the oil and dying coal industry wants!
9127 2018-01-25 02:40:40 It's harmful to poison the air of a mom and her fetus. Let's stop polluting asap. Don't wait and let industrial oil profits vs renewables profits dictate the timing. A child's health is a horrible thing to waste.

9139 2018-01-25 02:39:11 The oil industry makes up one of Calvert's biggest donors. Calvert chairs the environment/interior budget. So they bribe him to deregulate, letting them extract resources and harm our environment and health. For ex., he cut the EPA budget by half a billion dollars last year.

9294 2018-01-25 02:16:51 So why are at least two major employers in our area closing or cutting lots of jobs? Why are you gutting one of our major sources of power - solar - so that your oil and coal promises to “base” will be met?  Your base is only 30% of us so they won’t get you re-elected.

9311 2018-01-25 02:14:45 When are we going to bring back all the whaling jobs to address unemployment on east coast? These new fangled oil and natural gas industries are largely to blame. So, let’s raise tariffs and taxes on them and deregulate the fishing (or aquatic mammal) industry.

9360 2018-01-25 02:08:05 Buy Silver Bullet Gun Oil by the case.  Even if you don't own a firearm, it still has many uses because it is a mixture which contains about 1/8th pig grease.  Be creative.

And by the way, I do not have any financial stake in this matter.  I'm simply a fellow infidel.

9363 2018-01-25 02:07:50 Healthy oils. The main oils I use are extra-virgin olive oil for salad dressings and dipping; canola oil for cooking and baking because of its light, neutral flavor; and sesame oil for Asian-inspired stir-fry, dressing, or sauce.

9367 2018-01-25 02:06:56 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

9369 2018-01-25 02:06:23 The fact that Koch owns over a million acres of the Alberta oil sands had nothing at all to do with Trump pushing through the pipeline. WRONG!

9381 2018-01-25 02:03:19 I heard olive oil helps.
9382 2018-01-25 02:03:06 All the more reason to lessen the demand for both oil/gas and illegal drugs.
9383 2018-01-25 02:03:05 It helps that Hillary isn't our president and Trump did appoint a good conservative supreme court justice, is fighting to fund our military, to get our country back on its feet and not dependent on foreign oil. I am optimistic because I see how people are getting involved.

9421 2018-01-25 01:57:24 I painted once with oil paint and no ventilation and I thought I was dying. I was like 15 or so. Seriously thought my life was ending. Worst headache ever. So I totally feel you on this one.
9422 2018-01-25 01:57:07 Price of oil p/bWest Texas Intermediate =$66.16 (U.S)Brent= $70.87 (Europe?)*Bonny light (Nigerian crude oil)= $71

9430 2018-01-25 01:55:40 You missed a super entertaining hilarious stream of olive oil cleansing, eating soggy cereal, a bunch of humor and entertainment of the amazing Cynical talking about random stuff. It was awesome. You missed an awesome stream.

9435 2018-01-25 01:55:10 @SecretaryZinke As a Californian and American, we cannot afford to continue drilling for oil. Invest in smarter technologies and renewable energies. Have some integrity in your position.
9436 2018-01-25 01:55:02 I found this article for you:

9442 2018-01-25 01:54:38 when you disassociate hard as fuck and splash 450 degree oil all over your hand
9443 2018-01-25 01:54:17 Indeed. ...And the 12-year-old girl that Jeff Sessions is fighting in court who desperately needs CBD from medical marijuana? THESE FUCKERS ARE ALL PURE EVIL. NAKED, OBVIOUS EVIL. They're lucky there's no god; they'd all be boiled in oil if there was...
9444 2018-01-25 01:54:11 @ShitJokes The level of pollution in the world is getting worse. I just opened a can of sardines to find it full of oil and all the fish were dead
9445 2018-01-25 01:54:05 As would I but the technology isn't there yet. And continuing to push these oil rigs further out to sea based on asthetics is why you have disasters like Deepwater Horizon. It shouldn't be all or nothing. Drill where it's safe and continue to explore other alternatives.
9446 2018-01-25 01:53:46 Old bay, Cajun seasoning, a pinch of salt, garlic powder, olive oil and after it cooked I added oregano  and squeeze of lemon because I couldn’t find my parsley.
9447 2018-01-25 01:53:34 We were out of truffle oil.
9448 2018-01-25 01:53:33 I’m not confused. Big oil (natural gas) and coal paid for this in campaign contributions and now they want their due. I work in the oil industry. I’m voluntold for many a seminar luncheon. You should hear what these industry speakers have to say. 
9449 2018-01-25 01:53:27 it’s red sauce and olive oil/garlic, I will tell no jokes about this serious topic
9450 2018-01-25 01:53:22 This article is great talks about the Pope visiting the Amazon and telling them there under threat. The indigenous groups explained to the Pope all the illegal mining, oil exploration..etc Really shows how indigenous groups all around the world are under threat. #mcphsrel
9451 2018-01-25 01:53:04 Why does he always have an oil slick on his face?
9452 2018-01-25 01:52:40 Dreki was always an abortion. I looked into it in 2012/2013, long before the oil price collapse. The economics did not work then and they do not work now. How many people live in helicopter range of that field?

9456 2018-01-25 01:52:09 Does this mean I can't do olive oil shots every night anymore
9457 2018-01-25 01:51:47 Last I heard we were feeding you lot our oil. We wouldn't bite your manky hands anyway.

9474 2018-01-25 01:48:58 They are trying to tell you housing prices are rising because of lack of supply. They are telling you crude oil prices are skyrocketing because of stock pile decreases... both are lies..the price of everything is inflating because the dollar is losing value... wake up.
9475 2018-01-25 01:48:50 If you don't strike oil in 5 minutes, quit boring.

9485 2018-01-25 01:46:26 He is certainly complicit @PressSec . When money from the NRA makes you ignore evidence and directs a policy of ignoring school-shootings, you are complicit.

9497 2018-01-25 01:44:12 Lmao you can wash your hair everyday as long as you put oil everyday . But what’s the point of goin thru that every single day my g
9498 2018-01-25 01:43:32 It's utter foolishness to sell our oil, we should be the last ones to run out, not amongst the first. Of course this is about wealth for a few of the wealthiest in the USA.

9507 2018-01-25 01:42:13 Might have high cholesterol. Had to Google what to do: Eat more avocado & salmon, use olive oil. Red wine & dark chocolate? Yess.. What factors cause it? "SEX". WHAT?! Too much or too little causes high cholesterol?? Oh you mean "sex" as in men & women have diff levels.. Whew...
9508 2018-01-25 01:42:00 Its similar to a car engine being run dry of oil and still ran until all the parts break. He would never go to the doctor over things, and his doctor visit for a antibiotic shot to get better turned into this.

9510 2018-01-25 01:41:10 Take into account the huge benefit Modi govt got due to the less than 50% drop in  crude oil prices.
9511 2018-01-25 01:40:55 Girl, I got tea tree oil in my eye one time and I just knew I was about to lose all my sight

9513 2018-01-25 01:40:39 Agree 100%, just a blow hard with lots of blustery talk. Nothing more than a snake oil salesman.

9520 2018-01-25 01:40:00 Use the least amount of oil, make up wipes do the trick. They last 3 weeks before I need a fill. Most girls go 2-3 weeks but depends on how hard you are on them. I work out and wash them and wear eyeshadow/etc. and they last a while.
9521 2018-01-25 01:39:53 I seriously drive around 100 miles per day. Oil changes have never been so frequent in my life
9522 2018-01-25 01:39:32 A type of oil.
9523 2018-01-25 01:39:30 I was told to apply tea tree oil to my problem areas on my face, someone tell me why I didn’t hesitate to put that bitch all over my whole face 
9524 2018-01-25 01:39:19 Dems need to learn messaging. Gop senators on every tv camera talking about fbi secret society’s . They say these things with no shame. They just stand up and scream “we won!” Squeaky wheel gets the oil
9525 2018-01-25 01:39:06 I spray them with cooking oil before I put the cake in. Helps a ton with the mess!

9531 2018-01-25 01:38:20 Would you prefer the oil companies to drill in the deep sea which can have even worse effects or continue to buy from hostile countries that support terrorism?
9532 2018-01-25 01:38:10 Don’t forget enhanced oil recovery.
9533 2018-01-25 01:38:01 Yuh does real think someone in Trini ain't illegally moving oil from unnuh oil rigs ?!?
9534 2018-01-25 01:37:49 I have a mix in my spray bottle that I used to braid my hair up at night. Half water half olive oil and wild hair growth oil. It’s great.
9535 2018-01-25 01:37:42 Why do people cook with so much oil?
9536 2018-01-25 01:37:34 Lmfaoooo not enough n too much are right . Ur hair needs oil everyday my g not just on weekends
9537 2018-01-25 01:37:24 So Apple heard about OIL in Guyana, and allowing us to purchase apps on appstore :-)
9538 2018-01-25 01:37:22 There’s this spot in Santa Monica on Lincoln where you make your own. It’s sip & candle making & they’re made out of coconut oil & u choose your scents. It’s dope.
9539 2018-01-25 01:37:10 So true Ann and the fact that every politician except Berny voted to go to war with countries that didn't attack us, especially the Republican party.  But oil, cell phone materials and opium are super important to finance the oligarchy.
9540 2018-01-25 01:36:59 I grabbed some shares earlier... oil is hot

9546 2018-01-25 01:36:02 I just sauteed garlic and broccoli in olive oil, add the cooked spaghetti and some pepper then I add the vegetarian sausage. If I had mushrooms I would have thrown them into but I didn't.

9548 2018-01-25 01:35:35 Add honey if you wish, then strain and drink when cool. Frankincense aromatherapy oil can also be used as an aid to relaxation and for settling the emotions. It is a powerful cleanser of the energies and enhances intuition, awareness, empathy, and compassion.
9549 2018-01-25 01:35:30 Don't bite the hands that feed you? Scots don't pay taxes that are collected by the UK gov't? Scottish corporations don't pay corporate taxes? The UK gov't hasn't sucked up oil and tax gases for decades to blow on foreign wars? Maybe you might should stop doing the same.

9553 2018-01-25 01:34:54 Wanna see a dictator. Just look at the white house. Sorry but the dictator is at your own door. Maduro got my respect. Because he is fighting for his country and don't let other countries get his volks oil. US loosing power in the 21 century. So who cares what you think.
9554 2018-01-25 01:34:42 Trump will block any progress that threatens his oil lobbyists.

9557 2018-01-25 01:34:19 There have been several stories of people using it for seizures. I read one where a little girl was having in excess of 100 bad seizures a day. Using cannabis oil, they went right down to maybe 1 or 2 a day.
9558 2018-01-25 01:34:11 That’s so weird I got an oil change too lmaooo
9559 2018-01-25 01:34:11 I put coconut oil in it every weekend (sat and sun) is that not enough? And I use shampoo and conditioner every other day. Is that too much?
9560 2018-01-25 01:34:02 It appears that everything nowadays is going parabolic. Oil is the latest example; markets have gone complete nuts. Makes no sense at all.
9561 2018-01-25 01:34:00 I gotta find some flaxseed oil.

9567 2018-01-25 01:33:26 Monika keeps it on her nightstand, where she claims it "looks great". It may look great there, Monika, but pubic hair oil on your nightstand is not a great look.

9571 2018-01-25 01:33:07 Would it be more accurate if you drew more oil rigs, "game wagons", and entrance fees on your pictures?

9586 2018-01-25 01:31:06 We will soon surpass Saudi Arabia and rival Russia for annual oil production. We will achieve domestic crude oil production exceeding 10 million barrels a day this year and will become the largest natural gas exporter by 2020.

9588 2018-01-25 01:30:55 if you ever need a quick side dish honestly just sauté broccoli in coconut oil and add garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne. yummy and low calorie.
9589 2018-01-25 01:30:44 One time someone told me they ate spoonfuls of coconut oil and I almost gagged because I’m pretty sure that’s not how “healthy” works
9590 2018-01-25 01:30:42 He’s buying time. Chinese having been supply coal and oil for months. He’s out of food and it’s winter. He has to make it until wheat grows

9596 2018-01-25 01:29:37 Life isn't fair.

The majority of the poorest people live in Africa and regions of Asia, where their governments have squandered the little wealth they had, and routinely deny things like oil exploration (which raise wealth)

Not the fault of citizens or economics. Mismanagement.
9597 2018-01-25 01:29:34 Got it. Done that myself when we redid former home. It’s not a job you can do with gloves. I’m sure you know this but tea tree oil and shea butter help.

9603 2018-01-25 01:28:48 To me, this feels like a secured line of credit.  And good luck demanding exchange for oil and gas with Venezuelan cryptocurrency and getting it in 30 days.   Doubtful it would work like that.
9604 2018-01-25 01:28:45 The immune system is what gives the body energy and helps it fight off and prevent disease. These plants should be considered in any regimen to empower the body.

9607 2018-01-25 01:28:24 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

9637 2018-01-25 01:21:12 Nancy said ‘crumbs’. Wonder how much of a raise she gave her staff. And is it gender equal like Trump. Anyway, my ‘crumbs’ equal a pay increase of $50+k for this year, excluding extras. It’s not as advertised since I’m in the oil and gas industry. Tree huggers would be triggered.
9638 2018-01-25 01:20:55 Lemongrass Oil in my diffuser. Lights out. AHHHHHH. 

If you haven’t got a diffuser, I highly recommend. Gets me off to sleep so quickly on a night! Love it. Night all!
9639 2018-01-25 01:20:32 OP said not to put coconut oil in your pussy and then I replied with my RT but honestly, if it works for people, use it. I'm not here to speak over anyone's doctor. People feel very strongly about using it and it's their body so I'm glad it works great for them. 
9640 2018-01-25 01:20:27 higher paying jobs, and no need to weaken the dollar. If we are focusing on exports such as oil, and tech (iPhone) a weaker dollar is good.

9647 2018-01-25 01:19:46 I use Gamblin Gamsol which is an odorless mineral spirit. The oil paints themselves don’t really smell. My art room is also super drafty.

9667 2018-01-25 01:16:43 There’s nothing weird about it. The Chinese were dumping solar panels on the market below cost.

It doesn’t matter what the product is. The important part is the dumping. The list could just as easily have included thermocouples used in oil refineries, and dildoes.
9668 2018-01-25 01:16:41 When the price fell last couple of years the service companies had to slash rates and reduce staff . Logically the oil companies should agree to the service companies increasing their rates .
9669 2018-01-25 01:16:36 Prove me wrong! Tell me, why would Trump put a Tariff on solar panels? We will have to wait and see if I’m right or wrong. Or it could mean Solar Panel sales are putting a big hit on campaign donors who own and sell coal, oil or natural gas?
9670 2018-01-25 01:16:32 Shea butter and coconut oil lotion bars are coming. First trial batch is lavender orange :)
9671 2018-01-25 01:16:30 Someone asked me to describe the smell of patchouli, and I said linseed oil mixed with a trust fund and just a dash of cultural appropriation.
9672 2018-01-25 01:16:18 Now that’s got to be the most unoriginal answer I’ve seen all day.

Why would ISIS attack Japan? seriously?
It’s not like they messed around in middle eastern politics, redrawn borders w/o asking, all to have access to their oil, at the price of innocent lives.
9673 2018-01-25 01:16:06 True. A lot of tough talk , no results.
9674 2018-01-25 01:16:04 Well folks America First won’t go over well with the globalist crowd. Remember these are the world trade crowd. While Trump talks coal & oil they talk green (solar, battary & wind).
9675 2018-01-25 01:16:04 Warren has been very bearish on oil for years. This oil inflation not in his assessment of the airline industry.

9680 2018-01-25 01:15:06 If the Dominican Republic did in fact supply oil to North Korea, they should be ashamed of themselves. Action must be taken to prevent this from happening. The Dominican Republic does not, by any means, support communist regimes and the people deserve an explanation and apology.
9681 2018-01-25 01:14:55 I love paint. I like watercolours. I like acrylic paint... a little bit. I like house paint. I like oil-based paint, and I love oil paint. I love the smell of turpentine and I like that world of oil paint very, very, very much. David Lynch
9682 2018-01-25 01:14:48 ...and if they ever find oil there, it will be again
9683 2018-01-25 01:14:47 @realDonaldTrump Solar employs more people than coal & oil combined. Thanks to your 30% tariffs on solar panels, 20,000+ will lose their jobs.
9684 2018-01-25 01:14:42 You bet. You can live without gold and silver, not so with water. In 20 years it will become more valuable than oil.
9685 2018-01-25 01:13:46 The only way a dude can do all that at a young age is if he comes from money, oil field or slanging

9692 2018-01-25 01:12:49 @jimcramer I'm not selling Schlumberger. I just bought it at $79, guess I missed that run up from the start of the year you were talking about earlier. Oil prices are consistently going up, but this stock is down again today. Just confused is all.
9693 2018-01-25 01:12:38 - For a variation in flavor: garnish the scallions in a bunch, drip white sesame oil on said bunch, then stir
- Add shiitake or aji-no-moto for umami
- Use firm tofu to avoid scrambling the tofu. Add more water to cook it longer, add more corn starch to re-thicken sauce

9702 2018-01-25 01:11:35 I have a bigger problem with Big Oil from the standpoint they cone off as unwiling to share the big tent with renewable energy—i.e. the future. Need to focus way more on renewables.

9714 2018-01-25 01:09:22 @ThorpePark The cleaning! And I am vegetarian and Burger King is hardly meeting my lifestyle with the obligatory UK-wide fish oil in the products. So, it's hard to put me JUST ANYwhere in Food! And it's hard to give me directions to put down 'I'd be happy to work anywhere.'
9715 2018-01-25 01:07:51 やっぱそうなっちゃうよね。こっちの子は胸に名前刺繍してあるのもあって、個人情報は？おさがりも貰えないじゃん！って感じですわー。

9717 2018-01-25 01:07:26 Discovering the olive oil + sea salt combo was one of my best finds in 2017
9718 2018-01-25 01:07:16 i made my own small acne spot treatment out of a cocktail of witch hazel. sea breeze, a little tea tree oil, and a small splash of of apple cider vinegar.

9723 2018-01-25 01:06:16 went to a lube wrestling event which was sponsored by the company “Gun Oil Lube” and I think we can all agree that this is prolly the butch lesbian equivalent of a Miss America pageant. This is not a joke

9725 2018-01-25 01:06:04 My creation tonight: roasted brussel sprouts and apple chunks (not roasted lol) on a bed of 4-grain rice (cooked in veggie broth), with a side dollop of avocado spread I made (avocado, olive oil, garlic, onion powder, chili flakes, salt & pepper)
9726 2018-01-25 01:06:00 Alors, deux conseils pour optimiser sa partie sur Iconoclasts : 
1. Garder les ivory oil, les deux ou trois premiers perks à crafter avec sont nuls, alors que le Detonator vaut le coup.
2. Utiliser LT pour monter plus vite aux échelles.

9728 2018-01-25 01:05:33 I love Glossier products, but I couldn't get them to tell me where/how they source the palm oil they use in multiple products. >:(
9729 2018-01-25 01:05:25 They IIGHT. It's like a VERY small amount of oil and the crisp of it is not worth the trouble. Deep fry it and hit the elliptical.
9730 2018-01-25 01:05:24 at what expense Donald - clean water? safe foreshores from oil spillage? free-reign for banks to bankrupt the world again? Corporations love it. Average citizens? Not so much

But I’ve had doctors have me “prescribed” to several supplements that worked, fish oil, vitamin d, co-q10 with measurable results
9735 2018-01-25 01:04:19 I want to be one of those retarded dipshits that gives a flying fuck about different types of olive oil
9736 2018-01-25 01:04:16 My hair’s dry to begin with so that makes me nervous  do you use the oil or shampoo?

9744 2018-01-25 01:02:12 The world is moving away from oil and towards green energy. Right now we are watching the US go the direction of oil and they are at risk of being left behind by the whole rest of the world. We do far better keeping that black gold in the ground.
9745 2018-01-25 01:02:09 Burts Bees paw lotion it's with rosemary and olive oil and it works amazing! @zerena_hoofs you can get it off amazon for 4 dollars
9746 2018-01-25 01:02:00 Is it "efficient" that capitalism has no way to account for negative externalities and long-term risks like climate change, and instead encourages doubling down on extracting all the oil it can, even though doing so would make the planet uninhabitable?

9748 2018-01-25 01:01:38 These cars engines aren't very different from some of the airplane engines of that time. They had much smaller oil pans, but the rest is really similar. Amazingly complex from a mechanical perspective.
9749 2018-01-25 01:01:38 -no, Dale and Liz are not here at 8pm

9750 2018-01-25 01:01:30 Trump simply did this to appease his coal/oil CEO buddies. Meanwhile, China is drinking our Solar milkshake.  #TrumpsWarOnSolar
9751 2018-01-25 01:01:27 Honestly that was the worst fucking call ever. And we are the best Manchester in Manchester. Look at our cabinet compared to man shittys. We’ve been the best and they barely started being a winning team in 2011. Once that oil money hit they became decent.
9752 2018-01-25 01:01:18 So Trump signs legislation putting a 30% tariff on imported solar panels ensuring continued hydrocarbon-based energy production. So the guy that claims not to be a puppet kowtows 2 Big Oil
9753 2018-01-25 01:00:36 What, in order, are your favorite parts of the fifth quarter on a deer, and top preparation for each? I love the heart, brined sliced thin and pan fried in avocado oil, then tongue boiled and salted. Haven’t explored beyond those...yet!

9755 2018-01-25 01:00:29 Yes use the one and only brand it had argan oil in it so it gives u long lasting color but no damage.
9756 2018-01-25 01:00:25 Huh. 20 years in VT driving all manner of cars, including the one I have now that is 11 years old, and they've never once failed inspection.  And I'm lucky if I remember to bring them in for an oil change once a year, so that has zero to do with my upkeep.
9757 2018-01-25 01:00:23 Yes. Trans,oil coolers
9758 2018-01-25 01:00:12 Exactly.  When he made Tillerson head of the State Dept. I immediately thought there was an oil deal going on in addition to sanctions.  See the posts by @WendySiegelman She’s doing great work explaining the oil connections.

So good. I can die in peace now.
9813 2018-01-25 00:52:08 so far, 2018 can be summed up by the fact that today i was just minding my own business... and proceeded to slip in a puddle of hydraulic oil, fall on my face, and slide down the sidewalk.
9814 2018-01-25 00:52:06 Go Harli!
9815 2018-01-25 00:51:57 No. Because I have like no spices in my house. There’s a little olive oil & pepper.
9816 2018-01-25 00:51:52 @polymath1217 #polymath1217 Radical Idea; all workers, globally, go on strike for one week. #StrikeForAWeek. Five days, February 12-16. Police, fire, emergency hospital exempt. Can we still form community trading groups? Compost? Recycling? No coal or oil or its derivatives. 
9817 2018-01-25 00:51:49 Ha. I'm happy to say I've long since departed the world of trading, as much as I enjoyed it. So market timing is no longer my game. That said, I do start offering some timelines, even in part one of Oil Fall, as to when demand growth for oil will head towards the flatline.
9818 2018-01-25 00:51:44 Its is an simple, just some cacao powder, coconut oil, and sugar

9822 2018-01-25 00:51:25 I've already helped 2 people get CBD oil for a loved one today

9823 2018-01-25 00:51:21 Steak with monterey jack and roasted peppers, pickled veggies, and guacamole, with oil and vinegar and pesto on toasted pumpernickel.
9824 2018-01-25 00:51:19 Coconut oil fixes everything.
9825 2018-01-25 00:51:17 Drinking 53g worth of coconut oil was extremely unpleasant. Pretty sure it's not going to sit well with raw eggs. Now, to wash that taste out of my mouth with some cheese, then go to bed.
9826 2018-01-25 00:51:13 At least it’s not canola oil

9832 2018-01-25 00:50:32 Workers had to fight Exxon in court for years to get legal superannuation entitlements.
I know because my husband, Mike Meehan, flew helicopters for decades to Bass Strait oil platforms. 
Dangerous, highly skilled work.
Exxon is a TERRIBLE employer.

9847 2018-01-25 00:47:35 Canada Gay friendly Oilsands & Natural Gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil & gas from regimes that throw our  off buildings.   Protesting Kinder Morgan pipeline = killing .
9848 2018-01-25 00:47:21 Don't why they ever expected to have door to door restored, 2/3 rds of Canadians were already on group boxes or small general delivery post offices. But Trudeau sure knew how to play the crowd, sell the snake oil.
9849 2018-01-25 00:47:15 “Let a nigga slide like some oil” 
9850 2018-01-25 00:47:12 dear people of Twitter is using coconut oil as a face moisturiser a good idea i.e. have you used it and did it have desirable results???
9851 2018-01-25 00:47:09 Really? Whilst the $USD continues to fall (revert to the mean), and the #US raises interest rates (US #oil companies in #debt) putting pressure on production there, and cheap #oil disappears, plus #MiddleEast conflict threats?
9852 2018-01-25 00:46:46 whenever i listen to solange singing i feel like my entire body is being cleansed with jojoba oil
9853 2018-01-25 00:46:41 We were trying to bribe individuals .  Russia an Qatar used gas and oil (and probably death threats in Russia's case) to bribe whole countries
9854 2018-01-25 00:46:14 Considering coconuts thrive in climates 71-93 degrees it stands to reason that it would be known as oil.
9855 2018-01-25 00:46:12 While ambassador to France Thomas Jefferson was served thinly sliced potatoes fried in oil. He wrote about it. The name French Fried Potatoes showed up in an American cookbook a couple of decades later. Much later, “French Fried” became a cooking shorthand for anything deep fried
9856 2018-01-25 00:46:08 Ek, I’m a bag holder of DWT right now.  You will laugh when I say avg. Never thought it will go from 55 to 65. So, I’m looking oil movement more than anything else and so all your tweets. Thank you for sharing your thoughts !
9857 2018-01-25 00:45:51 Been talking about trying the oil cleansing method and i stumbled upon @HeyFranHey ‘s old videos on it! I’m may be sold 
9858 2018-01-25 00:45:34 Precisely, to whom is this chart so dire, the oil companies? Forget them! Any trader who is worth their weight in salt, would already KNOW how to profit from the upcoming regularly-scheduled pullback in this (or any) market! It's just simple physics! 
9859 2018-01-25 00:45:30 This isn’t true! The local solar panel manufacturing company closed up when Obama was still pres. What about all the coal miners that lost their jobs over the 8 years of Obama? I’m not an oil or gas exec but damn, I voted for him and proud of MY President!!!
9860 2018-01-25 00:45:19 ya its good. cucumber w rice vinegar and a little bit of sesame oil is even better
9861 2018-01-25 00:45:16 Guess their just going to have to build manufacturing plants for them here and of course hire Americans for those jobs. Thank you @POTUS for America Winning Again! And yes this is exactly what we voted for. #AmericaFirst Oh Rob where is my Oil exec job and office?
9862 2018-01-25 00:45:07 My condolences, so I guess you were in bed with BO, Chuckles, and Nancy then. Funny because most people don't know how much oil & energy are used to produce your little panels. #Hypocrites much?
9863 2018-01-25 00:44:50 lol!
the solar industry is the future of this planet. Unfortunately the big oil companies lobby against it bribing politicians from the local to the national federal level.
Your president is one of those people who only see the instant gratification of money and power.
9864 2018-01-25 00:44:45 Oil Man danced with Commando Man and scared the hell out of them!
9865 2018-01-25 00:44:36 sheet dad oil can fair 50b0
9866 2018-01-25 00:44:19 i fed olive some coconut oil because it’s meant to be good for dogs and since i was putting it in my hair i thought hey why not but now she’s got a taste for it she won’t stop trying to EAT my hair
9867 2018-01-25 00:44:15 Taking the approach of do nothing a couple of years ago is the same thing you have been attacking Chia for doing in the last off season Without knowing the outcome if you think he should have done that with Hall Then to be consistent you must say it was the correct move this year
9868 2018-01-25 00:44:09 Ermmm, my point has nothing at all to do with it being a job. My point is, that meme is false as hell. Complete bullsh*t...Oil companies employ way more people. I feel sorry for the people who are losing jobs in that industry (if it is the case), but the meme isn't factual at all
9869 2018-01-25 00:44:03 I just wana say I tried kale blazer from naked juice and it tastes like potato chip oil throw up.
9870 2018-01-25 00:44:02 Yes Ma’am. I Was Playing With The Pepper Spray Gun Cause I Didn’t Know What It Was & I Shot It . It Mostly Hit The Wall But When I Cleaned It Got All Over Me . I Rubbed Vegetable Oil All Over My Skin Soo I’m Good Now 
9871 2018-01-25 00:43:49 Naw. I had center cut chops and marinated in sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and white pepper. Mmmmm
9872 2018-01-25 00:43:48 The young one tall skinny  hightest on oil 3.70 short one  then 3.49  then its everywhere 3.15 so one cutest the normal price
9873 2018-01-25 00:43:41 still using some old snake oil treatment to take our children.
9874 2018-01-25 00:43:34 牛タンと鶏肉が入ってた
あと玉ねぎと塩ダレかな？
9875 2018-01-25 00:43:32 Agregame bro y si no es mucho pedir regalame en dune oil  Gumelooo86 mi id
9876 2018-01-25 00:43:32 You should always use pure olive oil, doesn't have be virgin, and thicken it by reducing it - basically just boil the water out until it doesn't look watery. You'll know when it's just right cos it will like a sauce all of a sudden.
9877 2018-01-25 00:43:26 I just made THE BEST dinner. First I cooked some meat balls in the oven, then I mixed pasta, broccoli, and the meatballs together in a large pan with some garlic and olive oil w/ salt and pepper to taste 
9878 2018-01-25 00:43:24 ok i think the pepperment oil worked.
9879 2018-01-25 00:43:22 انا بصور لك المشهد بس 
9880 2018-01-25 00:43:21 & it makes the whole house smell like oil paints!
9881 2018-01-25 00:43:17 vines uncomfortably tied
trees painfully pruned
olives crushed for rich oil
grapes squeezed to make fine wine
yet we always fear the process
& shun the method of our molding
we uproot before it's had a change to grow
digging for the beauty in the ever present ash
9882 2018-01-25 00:43:14 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
9883 2018-01-25 00:43:05 Just played: Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning (Diesel and Dust)
9884 2018-01-25 00:43:04 You’ve been thinning for 2 years now Lucas oil. Embrace it while you can
9885 2018-01-25 00:43:01 Our economy is already threatened...The PM was very good at letting us know that he has no intention of spurring growth in Canada. Oil is trading at highs not seen since 2014. Why are our resource companies performing poorly? I wonder...
9886 2018-01-25 00:42:59 They should buy an oil refinery.
9887 2018-01-25 00:42:57 I miss oil painting.. but i dont understand how y'all are oil painting indoors unless you're using water based? I can't do it w/o ventilation and it's just too cold here to have windows open! Even with odorless mineral spirits I was taught it's VERY dangerous w/o ventilation!
9888 2018-01-25 00:42:53 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
9889 2018-01-25 00:42:45 When the stress levels high but you’ve already done 2 face masks this week & don’t want an oil spill on ur face 
9890 2018-01-25 00:42:31 Oil huh?  You know they are killing our planet, while you and the Trump put a tarrif on solar panels.  That's as dumb as cutting corporate tax rate while under full employment.  Oh wait
9891 2018-01-25 00:42:31 Also $50 for oil. Chop chop. Dinner was $10 so send $60 silently. 
9892 2018-01-25 00:42:29 Today, I knocked over a glass bottle of olive oil next to the stove soooooo I'm never buying a glass bottle again.
9893 2018-01-25 00:42:27 kinda like how disneyland pumps vanilla into the air, but how doterra diffuses their oil into the parking lot
9894 2018-01-25 00:42:24 When you stay up an extra 2hrs so the coconut oil sinks into your skin before you sleep rather than your pillow case ; that’s skincare dedication for you
9895 2018-01-25 00:42:18 Have a book to sale or snake oil to sale. Degenerate
9896 2018-01-25 00:42:13 It's all copper. Tons of copper. So it's natural resources, just like oil or steel.
9897 2018-01-25 00:41:58 No knife this wasn’t the Ranger version but USCG suggested shark repellant I’m led to believe is a fail. Signaling tools win the exercise. Mirror. Lit oil slick which might song the raft, then maybe water.
9898 2018-01-25 00:41:53 Finally spent the $50 mall gift card my boyfriend got me for Christmas.  Lol;;;
I got a cute shirt, a cute bag, a cute hat, and a smelly oil for my oil defuser/humidifier

9901 2018-01-25 00:41:41 オーバーキルなんだけどおおおおにゃーーんっ!?!?!?やっぱり油の絵によく馴染む…えへえへえへありがとにゃんっ
9902 2018-01-25 00:41:36 The fact they have the containers to steal that much oil is impressive by itself.
9903 2018-01-25 00:41:33 that first one could be re-imagined as a Renaissance oil painting- the figures are posed so perfectly
9904 2018-01-25 00:41:27 Didn't Turkey buy oil from the terrorist IS? & what about shooting down Russian planes & ensuring its pilots were killed?
9905 2018-01-25 00:41:23 ”Terrible.” Lutz stated, removing his oil covered gloves; placing them on the table. ”Fill up a bucket of water, I have to bathe myself ...”
9906 2018-01-25 00:41:20 .@stonemaiergames bought Scythe, no wood oil pieces in box... Umm can you please send me them?!!

Follow & dm please
9907 2018-01-25 00:41:19 Governor @henrymcmaster in the State of the State address: We can’t stop hurricanes, but we can stop oil spills on our coast…Our coast is an economic gold mine. #DontDrillSC #StateOfTheState
9908 2018-01-25 00:41:06 No, no they don't. You're a fraud peddling snake oil.
9909 2018-01-25 00:40:54 Haha. I’ve gone all out before and started ranting about how I don’t understand about the black oil which may be oil or may be blood or is it corn or bees or green fizzy stuff or what is the meaning of life? And this is probably why my colleagues don’t really watch it lol
9910 2018-01-25 00:40:49 Don't scratch it, use body oil.
9911 2018-01-25 00:40:42 I knew this day would come, but I thought I’d be more prepared. @Costco was out of coconut oil yesterday!!!
9912 2018-01-25 00:40:38 I *haven’t* done the math. But since the Peak Oil panic dried up many years ago, methinks we have already proven, maybe even in-production fields, w far more oil than our next 20 years’ needs at current rates, which will have to be cut to come anywhere close to only hitting +5ºC.
9913 2018-01-25 00:40:10 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9914 2018-01-25 00:40:07 Coconut oil always fixes my skin problems....and my vagina smells like coconut. Win win.
9915 2018-01-25 00:40:06 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
9916 2018-01-25 00:40:05 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
9917 2018-01-25 00:40:05 Lloyd needs a first class ticket to snobby shores with his state of the art oil rig
9918 2018-01-25 00:39:46 がん保険、入ってなくてさー。手術、入院じたいは30万くらいで収まるからいいんだけど、１年間抗癌薬使ってたんだけど、アレ、「はぁ～？！！！」ってくらい健康保険使っても高かったから、がん保険大事。
9919 2018-01-25 00:39:34 Are the #PTB trying to replace their lost Syrian oil revenue? Same playbook, new country? Meanwhile, 300 million do nothing.

9923 2018-01-25 00:39:07 Is coconut oil suppose to have a strong smell? It’s not a bad one but....
9924 2018-01-25 00:39:05 If UK Govt signs on behalf of Scotland then those deals become null and void. Gone. New rules day 1 as indy. UK Govt returns money for future. Hence expect oil companies to jump up and down as will have to offer Norway style terms to trade. Now where have I heard that before?
9925 2018-01-25 00:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9926 2018-01-25 00:39:00 We recommend buriti oil for anti-ageing products, mature skin, after suncare products and lip care products. #naturalskincare #DIYbeauty
9927 2018-01-25 00:38:53 If we undo the Hall for Larsson trade but still add Russell, Benning & a healthy Oscar, last year's blueline was still a massive upgrade on '15-'16. Many want to point Larsson as the reason for the turn around but it was a collective thing. As this year is proving.
9928 2018-01-25 00:38:53 two weeks later and I still haven’t went to get my oil changed, but I believe I have myself motivated for tomorrow. times like this I wish I had a boyfriend to help me with these types of things.
9929 2018-01-25 00:38:36 Jake: "What are you adding to that spaghetti squash?"

Butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, garlic. . .

"So everything that will stop making it taste like spaghetti squash?"
9930 2018-01-25 00:38:27 Yes it is - I know, let's hire some more Ex-Oiler players! What is wrong this club? Maybe they should move Oil to Seattle!
9931 2018-01-25 00:38:17 Fuckinng watercoloring for so long my oil brushes are all but ruined. Fuck me. Fuck that. Fuck it.
9932 2018-01-25 00:38:07 Sorry those oil paintings looked that real I mistook them for reality.
9933 2018-01-25 00:37:53 Gov. @henrymcmaster Economy and culture depend on pristine coastline. We can not take our natural resources for granted. While we can't protect the coast from hurricanes, we can prevent oil spills. Off shore drilling was voted against, won't happen #environment #stateofthestate18
9934 2018-01-25 00:37:42 Omg i only ever put it on my brows i have to try that next. Bretman uses castor oil but i dont want oily yuckiness clumping around my eyes overnight BLEGHHHH 
9935 2018-01-25 00:37:42 The Oil Will Cause The Same People Who Shamed You, To Honor You... Ask David!!!
9936 2018-01-25 00:37:41 Gov McMaster says SC’s coast is made of gold and not worth risking for polluting oil drilling
9937 2018-01-25 00:37:41 This is no doubt to prop up the oil industry for Tillerson & the 1% Swamp (his important base) MAGA’s were used & will be discarded as quickly as everyone else who doesn’t enrich him, his family or the super wealthy. Trump has been trying to schmooze them for his entire life.
9938 2018-01-25 00:37:31 I voted for it and I’m not an oil/gas company. I’m not against solar—but, I’m against obama blowing through 100s of billion of dollars for his green energy industry friends that donated to him—paid for by taxpayers.
9939 2018-01-25 00:37:31 tbh i just added sriracha to a teriyaki marinade i had mainly bc i didn't really have much left lolol and used a spiralizer on a sweet potato, sauteed the potato in oil and garlic and heated the tofu til it absorbed all the sauce.... super easy and tasty....
9940 2018-01-25 00:37:29 Truth be told----I could sniff sesame oil all day.

9949 2018-01-25 00:36:53 Oil spills, like hurricanes, can disrupt and damage a state’s economy. We cannot stop hurricanes, but we can avoid oil spills. We can’t take a chance. We must do whatever it takes to preserve this economic paradise.
9950 2018-01-25 00:36:50 Thank you Governor Mc Master for opposing oil drilling or seismic testing!
9951 2018-01-25 00:36:42 I cant keep buying this dam oil now i got a whole week to go no he didnt say im his girl leave me no money fool

9954 2018-01-25 00:36:31 I see where you're confused. You think the @GOP is interested in protecting Ameican jobs. The goal is to protect oil and now Russias energy $.
9955 2018-01-25 00:36:28 Yaayyyy I cant wait (please reply)
9956 2018-01-25 00:36:20 I would like to see an oily skin foundation tutorial. How to help combat that oil throughout the day.
9957 2018-01-25 00:36:08 @realDonaldTrump the economy was fine before you took over, your terrif on solar panels will do more harm then good but we know you have to keep your coal and oil interests happy. #Impeach45 #DumpTrump

9960 2018-01-25 00:35:53 I dont know why he gets to me miami but he acts to diffrent for me man they got my fav oil and candy in  that dam bp
9961 2018-01-25 00:35:42 This has nothing to do with China and everything to do with oil, coal and those states encouraging solar development. You know blue states like California?
9962 2018-01-25 00:35:37 I would think any increase in shale oil would be offset by the massive decrease in capital spend we have seen over the last few years on conventional oil wells... that has to impact supply at some point..
9963 2018-01-25 00:35:34 Coconut shower gel + coconut oil after is godly
9964 2018-01-25 00:35:23 I wonder....how does it feel Rick. 
How does it feel to sell your soul and the beauty of our country, to the devil.. and to Exxon oil.  Your heart must be as black as the oil you worship.

9968 2018-01-25 00:34:36 Oil know that fucked him up completely. Lol. I've never been in one so I don't know what to expect.
9969 2018-01-25 00:34:32 Do you really think there are that many oil execs in the US? Please get real!
9970 2018-01-25 00:34:26  u cant slick a can of oil lol
9971 2018-01-25 00:34:23 I would also add a point I make in the eBook: oil will have a very long tail. It's use will go on in materials, chemicals, etc for a long time to come. The industry to serve those needs will, of course, be a lot smaller than today. It's not a story about growth.
9972 2018-01-25 00:34:19 Oil
9973 2018-01-25 00:34:10 I so respect your efforts. We must protect our environment, not have snakes working there only to support the oil industry.
9974 2018-01-25 00:34:05 If you don’t want companies drilling for oil then quit using products that require oil. You can’t create the need for the product and expect the dirty side of the equation to end up in someone else’s backyard.
9975 2018-01-25 00:33:59 Tea tree oil has saved my life
9976 2018-01-25 00:33:48 Day 369: Solar energy companies, which employ more people than oil and coal combined, learned today Trump has imposed a crippling 30% tariff on solar panels.  The end result will be a loss in jobs. Or as he likes to say "JOBS JOBS JOBS". Whose pocket is he in again? #resist

9984 2018-01-25 00:33:18 OIL DIFF: 4.61 -> 4.8
9985 2018-01-25 00:33:11 Trump will lie. He doesn't care or realize anymore that he is lying. In any event, he can't help himself and this will be his undoing. The question is, who goes down with this ultimate snake oil salesman? I read Mueller not looking at Pence, so, something to keep in mind.
9986 2018-01-25 00:33:06 my favorite tidbit about the oil boom  is that a woman once got away with killing her husband because he was the one who brought them to Texas
9987 2018-01-25 00:32:52 It’s about the oil and russia
9988 2018-01-25 00:32:49 Nope. Not really. You know @amazon is looking into providing its own delivery service, right? Amazon is the new Standard Oil. Bought out Whole Foods, offer products at a loss to put the competition out of business, takes advantage of economically-deprived places to put warehouses
9989 2018-01-25 00:32:28 That's a good tip! Stanley has very sensitive/itchy skin and coconut oil helps
9990 2018-01-25 00:32:14 Solar power does not employ More than gas and oil. Obama tried wiping out those jobs. Thank heavens Trump is in office. When are you going to inform people that solar Power doesn't work in areas where there is normally a lot of cloud cover and bad weather. #ReleaseTheMemo
9991 2018-01-25 00:32:12 if you don’t have an essential oil diffuser then i 10/10 recommend getting one
9992 2018-01-25 00:32:07 校則、とは関係ないんだけど、この辺（鹿児島）公立の小学校でもみんな制服なんだけど、他の地域でも今はそんなとこが多いのかな？
9993 2018-01-25 00:31:51 I use Thieves oil every day!!
9994 2018-01-25 00:31:49 Buhari recovery efforts will not be genuinely meaningful until the Gulf oil wind falls investigated the loots returns , culprits arrested.
9995 2018-01-25 00:31:44 Jokingly, Burger says the county needs to strike oil to fund school growth needs.
9996 2018-01-25 00:31:37 I think the MCT oil in the #bulletproofcoffee was giving me stomach aches. I've reduced that and added cinnamon and it is yuuuummmooo!!!! Let's hope for no aches today!
9997 2018-01-25 00:31:16 Your income taxes were only 4% instead of 4.5%, so you had that going for you. Also, the oil and gas guys did fine. Focus on them and you'll be fine. That's what the legislators do.
9998 2018-01-25 00:30:49 It’s the Same thing,  you olive oil
9999 2018-01-25 00:30:40 Yeah I think misunderstood his statement, agree oil won’t be displaced so quickly
10000 2018-01-25 00:30:32 Lol I did. Btw not an oil and gas exec numbskull
10001 2018-01-25 00:30:21 Paying oil companies every day is hardly freedom, especially when they pay politicians to prevent new technologies from replacing this situation.
10002 2018-01-25 00:30:12 ¿Did you know that coconut oil is excellent for the skin as a powerful moisturizer and prevents acne, psoriasis and eczema?
10003 2018-01-25 00:30:02 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for Jan 24th $39.07 US/bbl +$0.78 +2.03% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
10004 2018-01-25 00:30:00 Lmao nope. If it's leaking oil, it will be obvious by the amount of dirt on/around the oil pan.
10005 2018-01-25 00:29:57 Oil changes are a rip off. My husband better know how to change oil. 
10006 2018-01-25 00:29:42 If your on an oil rig than I'm more interested in what alex outfit you may or May it be wearing!
10007 2018-01-25 00:29:39 and does that mean I can’t have chips, because they have cheese?? Or what about foods cooked in the same oil as chicken? Is that still vegan?
10008 2018-01-25 00:29:33 Good job Trump! Oil & Gas going up. Food prices going up. Washing machines price going up and no real physical jobs been created. Toys R Us closing 167 stores, Kimberly Clark cutting 5000 jobs, Carrier 600 jobs. Wells Fargo closing 600 branches & ATT cutting jobs. Good Job.
10009 2018-01-25 00:29:26 McGuire is a former member , she’s 70 now. Tories don’t fund the Saudis   . The Saudi s have bundles of money because they have oil. They fund lots of mosques and schools in this country.
10010 2018-01-25 00:29:23 Business classes should be part of a basic education—especially for artists. It's called show BUSINESS for a reason. Like oil, talent is a resource the to be exploited.
10011 2018-01-25 00:29:18 Got my tags, smog check, & oil change, & brakes ordered today  I’m feeling so accomplished 
10012 2018-01-25 00:29:11 There is no time for doubt & delay. That should be the strategy of Big Oil, not those that are meant to represent us. Time to #divestSF and go #FossilFree.
10013 2018-01-25 00:28:47 I think I see where you are going with the question. And it's true: alot of oil will be stranded, just like alot of coal will be stranded. But to your question, you would want to plug in one other factor: declines, and decline rates, from existing fields. HTH.
10014 2018-01-25 00:28:41 Part of the problem is people mistake politicians for experts. (Instead of seeing many of them for the snake oil salespeople they are)
10015 2018-01-25 00:28:37 Selling snake oil from a podium in the WH is just like being a legal defense attorney, insuring legal rights to their client, or - a gunfighter.
10016 2018-01-25 00:28:34  clearly more than just oil and gas executives voted for him but keep dreaming #MAGA #Trump2020
10017 2018-01-25 00:28:16 Getting tea tree oil in your eye >>>
