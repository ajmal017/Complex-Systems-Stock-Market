37 2018-12-13 23:46:53 Which stocks are relatively cheap?
38 2018-12-13 23:44:47 If you only read @CNBC - you’d think the economy stopped Nov 1. Simply b/c stocks corrected. 

Fact is it didn’t stop. Unemployment at record lows, wages rising, oil low, rates staying low

#Trump created a mess with media   None of them will say anything supportive for > 5 min
39 2018-12-13 23:44:18 news flash, everybody is dumping stocks.  No conspiracy here.  Maybe you should look at the market
40 2018-12-13 23:43:21 Dude, if you are afraid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) you have done something wrong. What have you done for the people hurt by the subprime mortgage crisis? Nothing. I’m sure you own stocks that benefited from other people’s suffering.
41 2018-12-13 23:42:28 Leading? He is in the minority not only financially but in his own party, I would guarantee that he has secured his fortune with stocks and bonds unaffected now by Brexit. He is like Boris a freak show who will never get a majority. Never again will I vote Tory!
42 2018-12-13 23:39:52 I am 31 and 100% stocks (VCN, XUU, XEF, XEC). My "safer" investment is my defined benefits pension from Qc government. Aiming to retire at 50! Nice blog btw!
43 2018-12-13 23:38:09 It could but I am adding puts as stocks rise. My point is, even if stocks do rally into the FOMC, it won't last IMHO.
44 2018-12-13 23:37:43 Here Donny is lying again to the American people again! Interest rates are going up again! Soon! Car makers closing factories, small business are going under, farmers not selling product, stocks going down, jobs are low paying, lay-offs are coming in January. Lies!
45 2018-12-13 23:37:00 Earnings are actually up this year and stocks are down. A correction but not a trend reversal.
46 2018-12-13 23:36:59 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed lower looking for support amid trade skepticism.
47 2018-12-13 23:35:27 I watch Mad Money and hope to learn about smaller cap stocks to potentially invest in.
48 2018-12-13 23:35:10 IMO the US will continue to grow and many are screaming out loud recession,including the media, so to try and diminish the president’s chances of winning a second term.Come 2019 people will start thinking where to allocate money and selected stocks are relatively cheap.We’ll see!
49 2018-12-13 23:33:20 Current poss include Short #ASX200 and #SP500 $SPX, Long $USD and a couple Weed stocks. Watching Oz goldies - tho not in yet. A pretty volatile sector. Some days I want in, other days Im glad I didn't.
50 2018-12-13 23:33:16 To review:

In the last week: Yellen, Draghi, and Volcker all acknowledged Systemic Risk after a Decade of being globally mispriced; while Political Risk is skyrocketing. Stocks are hanging by a thread at technical breaking points and 90% of asset classes are negative in 2018...
51 2018-12-13 23:33:05 Every CNBC guest: Stocks are cheap here

Also: If the Fed hikes rates again everything is going to zero.
52 2018-12-13 23:32:06 The S&P 500 finished little changed after a volatile session Thursday, as investors continued to be spooked by uncertainty on both domestic & international issues,driving up bids for defensive shares while financials & consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest drags.

1) Syria International Islamic Bank: SYP 928.79 (-1.59%)

2) Qatar National Bank - Syria: SYP 419.63 (-1.95%)

58 2018-12-13 23:28:52 Zacks covers over 4400 stocks. Most of those aren't Chinese companies. There's plenty of ways I can find reward in those other companies with much less risk. There are also other emerging markets I'd rather be invested in like Mexico, Colombia and Vietnam. But to each his own.
59 2018-12-13 23:27:45 When stocks make major turns there is usually more than one narrative to choose from, but no one ever really knows precisely why it happened. The dangerous part, though, is not believing something has changed.
60 2018-12-13 23:27:29 Ol’ Pat probably, like the other Senators who voted against, is heavily invested in war industry stocks, and doesn’t want to see any dip in their profits. Moran still knows which state he is from and who he represents.

62 2018-12-13 23:27:05 I was a subscriber. In the last few days he's made a pretty good case as to why he should stick to large cap stocks and leave crypto alone. His inability to conduct any sort of research beyond what's presented to him has left me fairly dissatisfied.

66 2018-12-13 23:23:22 So, are you saying that GBTC and weed stocks are driving the last final blowout top for this bull market, similar to tech stocks in 1999? @GaryKaltbaum
67 2018-12-13 23:22:40 Eliminate online sales, eliminate gun shows, gun must be sold by licensed sellers, have a 2 weeks waiting period, mandatory lessons, mandatory licensing, no automatic weapons, no bump stocks
68 2018-12-13 23:21:41 That foolish tax cut the @GOP approved is a good part of the problem. Companies buying back stocks instead of spending on workers. The trickle down was tried by Reagan and it failed. Greed is the big driver. Just ask the GM workers in Ohio who lost their jobs. WAKE UP MARCO.
69 2018-12-13 23:20:22 General views: bullish gold (but Im not a gold bug), bullish softs, bullish volatility, bearish US equities, yield curve stays same or steepens, financials overvalued, Argentinian stocks undervalued,  REITs & housing probably has value plays here.
70 2018-12-13 23:19:26 That move was nuts! haha
71 2018-12-13 23:18:06 Everything was down today after #FarmBill. All of my hemp stocks were down.. It seems anytime we have good news stock prices go down anymore; at least for the past couple months anyhow:-(
72 2018-12-13 23:17:10 Market Close: MBS +5bps; DOW +70.11; NASDAQ -27.98; S&P 500 -0.53; 10yr Treasury 2.91%; Stocks closed mostly lower, as Investors show their nervousness on US & China Trade negotiations and concerns over criticisms of Fed Rate Hikes (even though, everybody is thinking it).
73 2018-12-13 23:16:05 @generalelectric burn out NOT today shares jumped 49 cents, or 7.3% to $7.20. Although business Model was sputtering and spiraling. GE might bend, but never break after @jpmorgan upgraded stocks to “neutral”

75 2018-12-13 23:15:44 I’d like to correct something: SIPC insures for the NUMBER of securities, not value

So if you bought 100 shares at $100, the stock goes down to $1 and your broker goes bankrupt, SIPC will give you 100 shares of the company you bought. It will NOT provide you insurance of value

79 2018-12-13 23:14:13 Why would Jim Chanos short gaming stocks now? They’ve gone straight down for 6 months. They bring in billions in revenue for the Chinese govt. Adelson is a close friend of Trump. Cracking down on them now would be suicidal for China & a trade deal...
80 2018-12-13 23:12:21 Easy to talk about being 100pc stocks after a 10 year bull run. Let's see how the new investors hold up in the next bear market. 
81 2018-12-13 23:12:17 -Dow Transports at 52 week low

-Russell 2000 at 52 week low

-Housing and auto stocks rolled over

-Credit spreads widening with the yield curve flattening under 3%

Will Central Banks completely destroy their currency this time around or reinflate asset prices once again?

"...US stocks might rise, but only if the greenback falls. The US dollar might rally, but it will snuff out the stock market rally. The days of them both going up together are over. The milkshake glass is empty."
109 2018-12-13 22:53:00 Absolutely disgusting
110 2018-12-13 22:51:56 Maybe because of you and alt media, the general public is employed and getting out of stocks per your advice.
111 2018-12-13 22:50:05 If the U.S. economy is really booming, with so many Americans employed, why did the XRT, an index of U.S. retail stocks, hit a 52-week low today? The index is down 19.7% in the last 4 months, and will likely officially enter bear market territory tomorrow. Seems like a recession!
112 2018-12-13 22:49:24 Me llegó el email y yo pensaba que había cerrado mi cuenta de Robinhood. Lo usaba para cambiar penny stocks. Acorns tiene una tarjeta de débito pero no he verificado si es directo de las acciones o si es una cuenta de cheques/ahorros.

119 2018-12-13 22:45:29 Hi @HeatherWheeler it would be really interesting for you to give some detail how you arrived at this conclusion and why you haven't done more to prevent it?
120 2018-12-13 22:44:49 IMO $VIX is not tradable so what the patterns we are talking about? It’s just volatility index which we get from other parameters. Or am I missing something and $VIX acting just like the other stocks and have its own levels and patterns? Thanks

122 2018-12-13 22:44:22 The NRW have come up with a proposal to change the by laws to stop fisherman taking salmon and sea trout out of Welsh rivers on the pretext that there are not enough spawning fish to increase fish stocks. The real reason is of course agricultural pollution which is unchallenged.

125 2018-12-13 22:42:18 According to rolls press release, the work being relocated is approval and some design. The same work for private jets US already done in Germany. It days no job losses, I hope, and, once the dust has settled, will reevaluate.
126 2018-12-13 22:41:40 agree w/ @ptrcktrades also, Cramer will just tell you to join @CramerClub and recommend more stocks like $ge . what a selective memory the guy has. remember, he recommended $aapl at $8!!!!!!
127 2018-12-13 22:41:16 @HeatherWheeler have you changed your view in the last 2 years?
128 2018-12-13 22:40:07 Maybe a repeat of "reflation trade" in 2017. Fed pauses, $ weakens, stocks and commodities rally until the fed is forced to hike again maybe in six months. The other scenario is recession and stronger $. Don't think stocks and $ can have a sustained rally toghether from here.

134 2018-12-13 22:38:27 Classic. I wrote a letter to Mr Fabric*nt, my MP about Toyota. He sent me a photocopy of a similarly childish letter he wrote to the Telegraph and that was all.  They just don't get it.
135 2018-12-13 22:36:52 @karenfinerman Karen, do you know what the average investor yielded in 2018 in percentage terms.  I feel like I have done very poorly at negative double digits.   401k have held mid single digit but stocks have done crazy bad and they are all stocks everyone have recommend.
136 2018-12-13 22:35:50 Maybe time for a new MP? Past due more likely.
137 2018-12-13 22:35:45 and then i lose over 300 thousand GSP for losing a single match that came down to 1 stocks... Fuck off nintendo
138 2018-12-13 22:34:41 What good job?  Stocks go up and down like always. He keeps threatening to take SS and use it for other things. Doesn’t like Medicare. Let me know when my middle class life gets better. He’s a thug
139 2018-12-13 22:34:05 People worried about this country going to hell in a handbasket, forget those worries! Just keep an eye on handbasket stocks.

145 2018-12-13 22:33:15 Heather Wheeler, my MP is a disgrace
146 2018-12-13 22:33:07 at least you have proof of the poor judgement of your elected representative and evidence of the fact that you have more political awareness and are better qualified to be a MP than the halfwit who holds the position currently.
147 2018-12-13 22:32:52 Most of our congresspeople generally START OUT as millionaires. It's expensive to run for office. They don't get rich from their salaries they get rich from their businesses or stocks or media appearances and book deals, etc. Or they really make out as lobbyists after leaving.
148 2018-12-13 22:32:22 Long oil, short stocks only way to go
149 2018-12-13 22:32:09 That would be like looking at stocks over a 3 year average and them equaling the same average price. One has been steadily declining the other two started slow but have been blistering. Which stock are you buying?
150 2018-12-13 22:31:50 Heather Wheeler is a fucking horrible piece of work.
151 2018-12-13 22:31:29 Fuck a Wall Street we ain’t playin wit them stocks 
152 2018-12-13 22:31:28 Wow. That’s absolutely shocking. So rude.
153 2018-12-13 22:31:26 This is a moronic, uncaring response. Devoid of any even potentially, positive human characteristic. In fact it’s lacking in basic common sense, too.
154 2018-12-13 22:30:48 I honestly believe RobinHood is more for the online poker player or people who love fantasy football, want to trade stocks ? Get a real platform and sit your ass down.

162 2018-12-13 22:28:04 @senJamesInhofe Do you really think that investment excuse will fly? Not in my world. You tell your investment people not to invest in any “conflict of interest” stocks! That’s pretty easy to do. Nope, you’ve been outed, Jimmy!
163 2018-12-13 22:27:55 … unless he *did* try, & was unable to rebut them, in which case his answer was both condescending & dishonest, which would be worse.
164 2018-12-13 22:27:55 Oil is rallying because it is massively oversold. Stocks are definitely not oversold

167 2018-12-13 22:27:07 I won't be happy until I see Rob Burley in the stocks. Don't get me wrong, seeing May and her government fall would also please me. #XmasWish
168 2018-12-13 22:26:40 Correct, however note that there's a differentiation between a cash balance and an investment balance with SIPC. Checking/savings as described by Robinhood's new offering is the former. Dollars invested in stocks via Robinhood's existing offering is the latter.
169 2018-12-13 22:26:38 What’s really annoying, to me, is the wholly uninterested attitude. It’s both disrespectful of the constituent, & of the facts. He could have taken the effort to try to research a rebuttal, & might have then *understood* the concerns & the reality of them…
170 2018-12-13 22:25:57 Oops! What "WE" did.

174 2018-12-13 22:22:46 you know that news about Netflix stocks... BTS... if only you released something there...
175 2018-12-13 22:22:20 Portfolio construction was also discusssed. i.e. Are you buying hundreds of stocks with value characteristics or a focused basket of value names? The more focused, the more tracking error and more career risk. #ETFsindepth
176 2018-12-13 22:21:54 She’s an absolute joke and certainly does not represent the majority of her constituents . Ashamed to have her as my local mp
177 2018-12-13 22:21:41 Most crypto investors lost money and won't make it back. For hodling invest in value stocks, Warren Buffett style. Investing in bitcoin (a highly volatile asset that produces no cash flows and has no fundamental price floor) is best coupled with risk management and profit taking.
178 2018-12-13 22:20:19 That’s a bit abrupt. Another voter lost! 

My MP replied thoughtfully &  in detail when I wrote to him, & intervened successfully on my behalf when I was being wrongly harassed by HMRC. 

His name? Geoffrey Cox - & no, I don’t vote for him. But that doesn’t make any difference.
179 2018-12-13 22:19:49 Maybe she didn't agree with him?
180 2018-12-13 22:19:33 Stocks can also plummet as a result of being overvalued in the first place and not necessarily through poor decisions.

190 2018-12-13 22:11:58 No, I agree with you there, but I also think the opposition against Facebook is real. Soros recently dumped his stocks in Facebook and a slew of attacks have hit them, affecting their stock price.
191 2018-12-13 22:11:27 Lemme put it in perspective 

I'm getting mollywhopped my lvl 9 cpus as Richter

I switch to K Rool and I win with 2 stocks to spare
192 2018-12-13 22:11:06 I disagree with my Mp but he always sends me a detailed outlune of his thinking. This reply is both disrespectful and wrong!
193 2018-12-13 22:10:50 And like I said earlier (I'm out of TLRY after today's afternoon pop), short-sellers ALWAYS scream "Get Out !!" when lockup expirations approach. If I had a nickel for every time stocks actually rose on expiration, I'd be a wealthy wealthy man.
194 2018-12-13 22:10:46 Thats aged well.
195 2018-12-13 22:10:40 FANG stocks: "investor fantasies". A bunch of hedge funds get together, pretend to buy stock in completely hollow shell of a business. They artificially bid up the price, then offer the remaining shares to the public. Real money from pension funds flows into hedge funds' offshore

203 2018-12-13 22:06:35 @GovInslee Capital Gains Tax is directed at the top 1.5 percent of the wage earners making $600K. We draw out from our retirement (wife and I are retired) dividends and stocks that equal about $85,000 per year w/yearly income of $131,000. How will Capital Gains Tax affect us?
204 2018-12-13 22:06:19 It sounds like a very good reason to ban insider trading. Currently our dear leaders are legally permitted to use confidential information to trade stocks for personal gain. Something that would land you or I in prison for a very long time.
205 2018-12-13 22:05:40 Are swordfish stocks under less pressure than a few years ago?
206 2018-12-13 22:05:38 I tried to test drive this vehicle at Mercedes in Beaconsfield and they did not have it in stock. Apparently, Mercedes in Aylesbury is the branch that stocks Mercedes Vans/Trucks, how odd!
207 2018-12-13 22:05:14 Surely they'd have infinite stocks of the things.. Plus, things like cat allergies should be more of an Earthly plane problem, kind of like bird poo.
208 2018-12-13 22:04:57 i lost the first match online against a toon link and when he rematched me he changed the stocks from 3 to 2 lmaooo

210 2018-12-13 22:03:32 Fed is the prime economic manipulators in US & ot ripples globally in bonds, treasuries & stocks, as they are also linked w/ other central banks, (BIS -> ECB, RBS, BoE, PBC -> HSBC, BoA, CM, etc...); financialization & commoditization of everything.

214 2018-12-13 22:02:20 I think the 2v1's traumatized Robin. He's just dodging forever and hardly attacking now and my level 37 Chrom has two stocks on him.

YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY ATTACK TO WIN ROBIN
215 2018-12-13 22:02:16 Yes- because the Chinese govt can just kick out the American casino operators. They can also do the same thing to their own companies (put them out of business at a moment's notice.) That's why I won't buy Chinese stocks. Too risky.
216 2018-12-13 22:02:06 @BoardAndDice so much hype around Teotihuacan and it looks like good fun too! Any idea when it hits the UK? I can't find anywhere that stocks it here :(

225 2018-12-13 21:59:40 Am I missing something here? DFN, KWH.UN and others have been beaten hard, and still paying the same monthly dividend, at today’s close div yield is 16% and 18% respectively for those 2 Div stocks, why? Idk, any comments will be much appreciated
226 2018-12-13 21:58:56 Humans evolved to eat domesticated cows?  Prolly not.  Now if your local grocery store stocks lean prey meats, by all means...but 99.99% chance they are domesticated, purpose-bred animals that have little to nothing to do with human evolution.

235 2018-12-13 21:52:03 I think I read on Zero Hedge there are hedge fund algos programmed to buy or sell stocks based on the VIX.

237 2018-12-13 21:51:25 Africa should try to maintain its traditional ways of conservation. We are the best conservationists. We shouldn't be bullied into signing deals that ruin our environment or deplete or fish stocks. Our traditional methods have enabled our seas not to experience overfishing.

243 2018-12-13 21:49:19 A apology from the MP is now required.
244 2018-12-13 21:49:08 A very weak response. Indeed a dereliction of duty. Dreadful @HeatherWheeler
245 2018-12-13 21:48:30 I’m afraid it’s going to explode next year. Wish I could get my stocks out of investment hands
246 2018-12-13 21:48:19 Me too. I’d also have to include the fabulous phrase - “I hate to say it, but I was right!”

250 2018-12-13 21:45:45 OMG that's an appalling reply!!! So curt & abrupt and such a rebuttal!  At least my missives to my MP met eventually with 1.5 pages of standard reply churned out by his printer on the same day to all who'd written in - without even as specific a concern as R.Royce! Appalling 
251 2018-12-13 21:45:40 Will they be proposing anything about lawmakers trading in stocks?  It would go some distance to improving faith in government if they all had their money in mutual funds.
252 2018-12-13 21:45:17 I think all politicians should be on lockdown and should not be able to get insider trading information and not be allowed to own, purchase stocks.
253 2018-12-13 21:45:04 That’s an appalling letter.

259 2018-12-13 21:41:48 I'm sure he is aware of book value within the quarter but the more relevant criteria for him is almost certainly whether he prefers buying more of the stocks currently in the portfolio (JPM, AAPL) relative to the merits of repurchases.
260 2018-12-13 21:41:35 What does this have to do with anything? Do you do the same with all failing stocks? How many did you save with Enron?
261 2018-12-13 21:40:56 thats why bitcoin & cryptos are better than stocks in term of investment bcause they are also a medium of exchange as payment without middle men taking those huge fees like banks, paypal and other services such as brokers and stocks exchances. Decentralized exchanges r the future

266 2018-12-13 21:39:41 yup, the newer holdings are definitely more volatile than the older holdings...I've been focusing on "small" caps lately...five out of the last six stocks that were added to my portfolio have markets caps under $5 billion.

270 2018-12-13 21:37:20 I’d like to see how etoro has come to the conclusion that XRP is one of THE most volatile in the crypto space. Do you have stats on that? or how that was determined? Guessing the metrics would not be the same as stocks?Thanks in advance.

278 2018-12-13 21:32:48 I asked the lady in the wine department of a supermarket her opinion on pairing a Chenin Blanc or an off-dry Riesling with my roast swan. She stared blankly like she had no idea.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended little changed after a volatile session on Thursday, as investors favored defensive sectors while the biggest drag came from financials and consumer discretionary stocks.

293 2018-12-13 21:23:48 sounds bearish for stocks

296 2018-12-13 21:21:38 Again what your saying here is incorrect. The Las Vegas shooter used AR-15 with bumb stocks and they seemed to hold up just fine.
297 2018-12-13 21:20:20 Thanks Mark. I start with 20% and then reduce and re-run screen depending on how many stocks are identified. Normally in a raging bull market, would end up with very few stocks at 20% as you say.
298 2018-12-13 21:20:02 That is appalling. Almost wilful ignorance. I hope she is unseated at the next GE.

Theres much of your answer.
But the real answer "its not a market, its a market of stocks". Stock and sector analysis, our key
304 2018-12-13 21:19:15 That's true. The main takeaway is that they can't be FDIC insured because they're not a bank, and therefore aren't subject to the same bank oversight and regulations that banks are.
305 2018-12-13 21:19:10 We have a capital gains tax on stocks. Not so on primary residences, so a higher carrying cost is justified on the latter. Are you in favour of scrapping the primary residence tax exemption?

307 2018-12-13 21:16:03 I think how much you invest just factors how much you lose/gain depending on the percentages of what you’re investing in but I could totally be wrong. I just know I keep investing $ and keep losing $. I’m just curious if you invest more in the larger stocks then the small stuff

over 60% of SPX and 65% of Russell 1000 names were also down

Apple masking the pain
332 2018-12-13 21:06:45 However, IMHO there is more negative weight on the overall high valuations pre revenues of the weed stocks here. And this is all being questioned right now.
333 2018-12-13 21:06:35 uh, no this is not correct.  Stocks are held/controlled by another company or exchange while you can hold/control your security tokens yourself and trade them in a permissionless, unconfiscatable fashion with other people. That's a huge difference!

354 2018-12-13 20:57:52 A lot of farmers used winter stocks over the summer so many of them will need a good spring to get cows out quickly as they won’t have much silage left. This will cause a decrease in production which with a no deal scenario will leave us around 7-8% lower in production

404 2018-12-13 20:37:28 @AMarch4OurLives I thought Trump was going to ban bump stocks
405 2018-12-13 20:37:28 I was already using their platform for stocks but now they're offering checking and savings and guaranteed 3% on both?! No fees on anything? Homerun
406 2018-12-13 20:36:35 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX,NDX bottom signals; SPX=2647; NDX=6756.  Not strong signals, but covering short term shorts advisable.
407 2018-12-13 20:35:59 When you're in the bond business, you like recessions... it's an unfortunate occupational hazard.  It's the only time you can get people to stop cheerleading stocks and allocate to fixed income.
408 2018-12-13 20:35:45 Another good example as to why the system needs changing. Any Tom, Dick & Harry can be an MP. They are not qualified nor required to have any particular knowledge or qualifications. They would not have their jobs in the private sector because they do not have the qualifications.
409 2018-12-13 20:35:33 I'm doing the max this month and next month. There are some stocks that I wouldn't mind scaling into for long term outlook. I still think DOW and SPX break support. Nothing wrong with gradual entries as anything can happen. What stocks you eyeing on recession @OccupyWisdom
410 2018-12-13 20:35:23 If you don't have stocks, and you don't live in one of the places that companies have clustered, then how is your economy recovering? And even if you do live in one of those places, if you don't have one if the well paying jobs, but rent keeps going up, how do you benefit?
411 2018-12-13 20:35:15 Shocking attempt at a reply. Id be sending her another email, doubt she would reply now however. Poor effort indeed #brexit #okforthemillionaires #liars #corrupt
412 2018-12-13 20:35:10 Does that mean they won't buy stocks today before the close? ;-)
413 2018-12-13 20:35:04 The markets are manipulate, @Fidelity is the worse company for active traders, moving out ASAP, buy  Marijuana stocks.

415 2018-12-13 20:33:52 Comparing stocks to flows... That classical technical fallacy almost everyone has gotta commit at some point in their lives.

426 2018-12-13 20:29:40 Hi @HeatherWheeler, your thoughts on Rolls Royce announcement they are moving some operations from Derby to Germany please. I assume you've given this a bit more time than when one of your constituents contacted you with their concerns.

480 2018-12-13 20:10:00 Been testing the meter for a bit on the go, and it seems that with DI, meter kills is like multi-hitting to 70-80% from 35-50% (not likely unless > 3 stocks) or at best 50-70% pre-req.
The fact that you lose a chunk of meter if you die and the meter is maxed is huge.

521 2018-12-13 19:58:13 @saamhodi similar to the lovely letter you received from your MP
522 2018-12-13 19:57:51 These inferences to bad fundamentals from bad technicals are gonna be wrong, on average. I don't own $TRIL. But I strongly doubt the price action reflects partially secret bad news. Too many obscure nanocap biotech stocks are crashing at once to imagine particular explanations.
523 2018-12-13 19:57:43 As Rolls Royce is so very much tied to Britain, this is a lose-lose for all parties.

524 2018-12-13 19:56:53 In hindsight maybe you should have said “cryptocurrency” as the stats are relatively similar for all with regards to 2018 OR simply advertised that you can also invest into stocks etc at @eToro. I’m sure we can all agree not your best marketing campaign

539 2018-12-13 19:49:43 Quand au prix, si l'offre est rare les prix montent.Quand vos granges sont pleines de fourrage et que la paille ne vaut rien j'imagine que vous en achetez à 4 fois son prix de marché par solidarité avec les marchands de paille qui croulent sous les stocks invendus...
540 2018-12-13 19:49:11 Mr. Burns, you gave me the best advise a while ago.  "Before you buy something, think how much you really need it. If you have the money to buy it and don't need it.  Put it stocks/savings account." You're not that much of a coach roach as people say.  Thank u Sir!
541 2018-12-13 19:48:53 @GuyB Yeah- buying too early is definitely one of the dangers of buying turnaround stocks as well.
542 2018-12-13 19:47:19 most of Republican Congressmen are corrupt and foreign agent look at Oklahoma senator @senJamesInhofe pushed for defense budget increase becuse he bought thousands of $$$$ in @Raytheon stocks or @senatemajldr conspired with Putin get @realDonaldTrump elected all must go to jail
543 2018-12-13 19:47:12 Let’s bring back good old fashioned public punishment like the stocks so everyone who feels betrayed can throw literally shit at them & leave them there for a week so they can think about what they have done.
544 2018-12-13 19:45:50 Where can I buy salt and pepper stocks right about now...
545 2018-12-13 19:45:46 Well, I suppose she's entitled to her opinion no matter how blinkered & ill informed. And there's no law that I'm aware of that says she must agree with overwhelming advice & supporting evidence from acknowledged experts in a field.

I think hell will freeze before she backtracks
546 2018-12-13 19:45:43 Okay, I remember every reason why I hate Nintendo online for Smash: I'M. A. GODDAMN. CASUAL. I DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYING WITH COMPETITIVE PEOPLE WHO TAKE FUCKING YEARS EVEN WITH THE TIMED STOCKS IT ACTUALLY IS ANNOYING I WANNA PLAY DAMNIT AND HAVE FUN, LEARN, NOT JUST... not.

548 2018-12-13 19:45:21 Tech stocks ate failing. Gaming studio's are losing big time. Huge loses.
549 2018-12-13 19:45:18 Should be decent day for oil stocks tomorrow
550 2018-12-13 19:44:44 Relative to option prices in the underlying stocks (implied correlation), it *can* be a measure of the market's view of systemic risk.
551 2018-12-13 19:44:11 I feel like this year, businesses were not wholly prepared for how much online shopping people would do. This Christmas season has been the season of glitches, out of stocks, shipping errors, crashed websites, lost packages&double charging. It’s normally bad, but not this bad.
552 2018-12-13 19:44:11 So easy to see ETF selling trends by examining daily charts of Tech stocks like AAPL,INTC,QCOM overlaid.

They should be outlawed, along with the FED.
553 2018-12-13 19:43:06 While not disagreeing with you on tech stocks, I have major reservations about Netflix.  Their loss of market share is going to be horrendous with so many copycat competitors upcoming.  Don't think that's been priced in yet.
554 2018-12-13 19:43:06 How the fuck does a juke on bmw stocks get in bangers, smh
555 2018-12-13 19:42:35 It's not even the corporations that gain much, it's just the tiny list of people with advance notice of these deals, who arrange their stocks and investments, timed perfectly to cash in quickly, leaving everyone else doomed. Where's the hiring? Where's the trickle-down? Nope.
556 2018-12-13 19:40:12 Will be nice to start heading back the other direction.
557 2018-12-13 19:39:53 Yet Little Niggle has spent years winding up Little Fish
To slag the very EU regs that saved what is left of their industry & restored our fish stocks
So we don't have to fish other nations waters with Royal Navy protection as in the Cod Wars
Not sustainable
We all pay for it
558 2018-12-13 19:39:43 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
559 2018-12-13 19:39:33 MJ stocks are weak today $WEED $CGC $ACB $CRON $APHA. Patiently waiting for a good entry point probably not today. Maybe gap down tomorrow will be a good time to buy
560 2018-12-13 19:39:22 I see so many FURUS telling their blind sheep to buy stocks. Last few days $AXXA and $DEVV and a few others. Don't be fooled by anyone. Do your own DD before you follow them, or lose your money.
561 2018-12-13 19:39:15 Doesn’t seem to matter my friend, 67-72 has a hold on this shitty stock like nothing I’ve ever seen. I’m a holder with you, but this is one of the most painful stocks I’ve ever owned. I’d like to think time will straighten things out, but my optimism is diminishing
562 2018-12-13 19:39:01 Well sorry i dont want to hurt THE crypto investors but in stockmarkets when they think Ow internet Goes down they buy other stocks like not internet related ...xrp is totally different solid evidence And still not up.. where is all the money from bitcoin or other coins?
563 2018-12-13 19:37:40 This is why you should always be a Republican.  If you have a lifetime to hold stocks when was it ever a bad time to buy them?  Ask Mario or Warren
564 2018-12-13 19:37:21 hyyuii
565 2018-12-13 19:36:43 Summat like "it's not Brexit's fault that Rolls Royce don't know how to run their business properly, project fear, everyone needs to just believe in Britain, yadda yadda yadda"
566 2018-12-13 19:36:18 Yes he’s still free and coming to a town near you! Feral f****r should be placed in stocks and pelted with shit! 
567 2018-12-13 19:35:57 No problem, you too. Remember, these gold stocks are so volatile, don't leave too much money on the table.
568 2018-12-13 19:35:48 You really think crypto is a better investment BEFORE traditional stocks? I disagree. People in crypto have been crushed by following this advice. Nearly all coins are down 80%+ from when the public got ahold of the industry. Stocks = investing. Crypto = speculative.
569 2018-12-13 19:35:48 Top tute at $TSRO is NEA. They're also the top tute at $AKAO. Both stocks hit record lows, both companies were/are for sale.... lots of similarities...
570 2018-12-13 19:35:27 Oil up $1+ last hour; energy stocks dropped during that period of time.  Wut ?
571 2018-12-13 19:35:06 Well Stocks and #Bitcoin. FX won't exist and neither will any credit instruments, Bonds/notes/money markets. But that's in 15-30 years post hyper bitcoinization and the Bitcoin Debt jubilee.
572 2018-12-13 19:35:02 Looking for an asset class with perfect correlation to oil on the downside and no correlation on the upside? Try energy stocks!
573 2018-12-13 19:34:14 Econ 101
By: QTR Research

The Fed buys bonds = All PhD economists agree on it, widely accepted as totally 100% normal economic policy

The Fed buys stocks = I'm a conspiracy theorist & asshole for even suggesting something so appalling could possibly ever happen, total nonsense
574 2018-12-13 19:33:56 Weed stocks getting lit, by oil.
575 2018-12-13 19:33:05 Stocks are sagging pretty hard, led lower by small caps $IWM. Looking for a down Friday and down Monday, as are common in bear markets.
576 2018-12-13 19:32:51 Wow. These people are arrogant beyond belief.
577 2018-12-13 19:32:38 Won’t be long now, time to take positions we have waited long enough. Edge your bets with stocks exposed to both Wick and Colter which has previously been flowed. #boil
578 2018-12-13 19:32:32 In less than 20 years it was no longer profitable to fish UK waters
Many small fishermen were put out of business permanently
And UK aquatic ecosystems  were destroyed
We're barely up to the same fish stocks now as before Big Fish got involved
That's what upset small fishers then
579 2018-12-13 19:32:28 Sorry, you need to get your facts straight before giving advice. Gold Futures are NOT stocks. They do have expirations and if you are holding a contract when it expires you will have to take physical delivery.

582 2018-12-13 19:31:43 Yeah Oil is supply & demand.  Drops like rock yesterday close.  Today Rips.  Op ex of course coming but this investor supply/demand not physical.  

Yesterday stocks dropped after oil rolled.  Will stocks rip today since oil strong? $spy

585 2018-12-13 19:30:45 Dropping the stock doesn’t fix this.  He bought low via insider trading, then made $ selling the stocks, I’m certain thinking that would fix his shade.
586 2018-12-13 19:30:41 Bonjour @SolaryTV est ce que vous allez recevoir des stocks de bonnets Solary ?

593 2018-12-13 19:29:05 ….selling oil > making money > buying their same stocks > killing news journalists > selling oil…

I love this simple business model, medieval at best
594 2018-12-13 19:28:54 Weed stocks are getting smoked
595 2018-12-13 19:28:27 It's true what they say about finding a strategy that suits u. I've been long all 2018 & I just wasn't patient enough no matter what I did. I thought I was "too positive" a person to go short, but, stocks go up & down, so why shouldn't I short when it's heading down?! 
596 2018-12-13 19:28:21 Had the urge to buy some stocks yesterday.

Did some research, looked at a bunch of charts.

That changed my mind fast.

600 2018-12-13 19:27:16 To risky people,  stay out of crypto and stocks....better savé and buy some land in some village. BTC is not going to zero, but it still can drop to 1000$ and lover.
601 2018-12-13 19:26:32 Jaguar, Nissan, Toyota, Ford, Airbus, Bombardier....list is endless. The City of London will be gone. 

Brexit has ruined this country and it will get worse. Your letter, shows the arrogance members of the public are viewed in. 

Get your friends to vote Lib Dem next time
602 2018-12-13 19:25:13 Will she now resign?
603 2018-12-13 19:24:59 So, today the market doesn't like weed stocks.
604 2018-12-13 19:24:42 Stocks down for year. 1st time in decade. Companies are facing debt trouble, notice lack of cap ex spending and now slow down in repatriation of money and stock buybacks. Trump is hurting their input costs with trade war.
605 2018-12-13 19:24:09 As a heads up, most stocks following the market dont want to come down anymore. May have to wait till around 310pm to see whats up
606 2018-12-13 19:23:51 Ignore #wallstreetanalysts-a parasitic class that guesses the market. They travel in a pack w their #underweight outperform jargon.. Too many #CEOs cater to them with guidance & analyst conference calls. They serve no useful function: Buy & hold good stocks that pay dividends!

608 2018-12-13 19:22:59 It will be when the market is deep underwater, when the purchased stocks are at a 20-30% loss if not more, that these companies will realise the situation they are in and the need for cash and that is when they will fuel the carnage to the downside.
609 2018-12-13 19:22:58  can we see both the email reply and initial letter? Well, you know, for context.
610 2018-12-13 19:21:59 Kuroda can be the only answer.  Is there anything easier than being able to print up money and buy stocks, bonds; whatever the hell he wants.  I’m sure he’ll be monetizing Mt. Fuji next. 
611 2018-12-13 19:21:57 These people make more money than P2P scams !!! Cakari stocks le dubega sabko !!!
612 2018-12-13 19:21:44 How is the bucket approach example different from allocating 5% Cash, 20% High Quality Bonds, and 75% in stocks and and simply rebalancing?   Leave it to the financial planning community to reinvent an old wheel and put a new spin on it.
613 2018-12-13 19:21:24 What other stocks do you like?
614 2018-12-13 19:20:54 and popcorn stocks are doing surprisingly well on @Nasdaq ...what has inspired this surge? 
615 2018-12-13 19:20:04 @HeatherWheeler you are embarrassing.
616 2018-12-13 19:19:44 Link’s dash attack just took all of my stocks.  Excuse me
617 2018-12-13 19:19:22 In itself they also create systematic risk in the current environment. In a market that appears to never go down it is viewed as the safest & most profitable thing to do with excess cash ignoring that stocks by themselves are a risky asset.

626 2018-12-13 19:15:12 @iBaibhavGupta I'm fairly new to this segment of trading. I mean stocks intraday. I usually trade in index options. But now I feel this is a better way of generating small but consistant returns.
627 2018-12-13 19:13:39 Thats disgraceful. At least you got a flippant reply from your MP, mine has ignored me - although he is a member of ERG so he doesn’t like facts or difficult questions so not really surprised
628 2018-12-13 19:12:07 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
629 2018-12-13 19:12:00 The shift to the intangible economy is happening now. Learn how our Active Quantitative Equity team is valuing intangible assets when choosing #stocks:
630 2018-12-13 19:11:58 People are traded like stocks with no say in the matter. This looks so familiar
631 2018-12-13 19:11:29 Even a  can go bull sometimes. GG 12/21 $9.5 calls are today’s move.

632 2018-12-13 19:11:07 Agreed. 
BTW once you can find some time it would be great if u could share some pointers as to how do you screen stocks. I mean what do you look for in say a list of 50 stocks to decide to enter a trade eg volume, OI, news etc
633 2018-12-13 19:10:09 Where do you find out on the markets on whether investors are optimistic or pessimistic on positive U-S relations w China? You look to U-S casino stocks, heavily dependent on Chinese gamblers. World famous short seller Jim Chanos now betting U-S casino companies including Wynn.

635 2018-12-13 19:09:46 Gold futures are stocks. You don't take any physical possession of metals. It's fine if you want to stay in the stock market but if we go back to the gold standard and the economy booms it's (IMO) it would be better to invest in any hard asset or company. Peace.
636 2018-12-13 19:08:52 @HeatherWheeler ... any thoughts on this?
637 2018-12-13 19:08:18 She's lying! Brexiters knew exactly what they were voting for, and this is a deliberate act of national vandalism.
638 2018-12-13 19:08:15 Love it!
639 2018-12-13 19:06:52 warioware is way too polarizing.  It's the same reason why we banned Delfino in s4, and Warioware is even more consistent with how early it ends stocks.
640 2018-12-13 19:06:20 Banks, retailers take stocks lower; smaller companies sink

642 2018-12-13 19:05:53 @ClayTrader25 possible cup and handle on 30 min GNBT in case you are looking for stocks to talk about. 21:1 forward split on 12/3

648 2018-12-13 19:02:57 Stocks made public that don't need partners for money
are buyout arbitrage vehicles
& therefore is inherently a dead weight loss to the economy!!!
Just an exit to bag-holders over the long run.
Attach risk to customer-given income, for the love of God
not Stock market / IRS & Fed
649 2018-12-13 19:02:40 Just can't get over doing more with less thing. Luck lost to the FREAKING BENGALS, and the FREAKING EAGLES, and the FREAKING JETS. AND GOT GOOSE-EGGED by the FREAKIN JAGS?!?! Are you high? These are all the laughing stocks of the NFL right now.

654 2018-12-13 19:00:00 Most U.S. stocks fell, with small caps leading declines, as trade tensions continued to weigh on financial markets. The dollar jumped versus the euro after the European Central Bank sounded a cautious note on growth - Bloomberg
655 2018-12-13 18:59:44 Yes sorry, put me in the stocks right away..

662 2018-12-13 18:57:55 3 stocks is part of it but there's more to it
663 2018-12-13 18:57:49 I now have my Psychology Composite safely back in the P-2 status. That means we are now P-2, M-4 and V-2, which still means to remain fully invested in stocks, minimum cash and for Long-term Growth accounts NO bonds.
664 2018-12-13 18:57:29 In the first 7 months Corker was in office, he made over 1,200 trades, almost all of them resulting in profits from buying stocks that shot up shortly after he bought them. Corker's four-a-day trade habit makes him a prolific day trader with a minor hobby serving as a US Senator
665 2018-12-13 18:57:20 Although the range trading has been nice for trading options on individual stocks. I’ve been in and out of Netflix 3 times.
666 2018-12-13 18:57:14 There are too many Democrats at CNBC.  Scott Wapner is so NEGATIVE.  Look at MSFT, CSCO, PFE, & PYPL.   These stocks will give a different attitude.  & there are many more like them.  Why don't you guys mention that TSLA is up over $100 in the last 60 days?
667 2018-12-13 18:57:04 u know.. in HK/ Tokyo they are gonna accumulate their tech stocks and lift nasdaq again some 40 pts and u all gonna look real silly at US open again
668 2018-12-13 18:56:15 It really didn't.

670 2018-12-13 18:55:53 advance decline pretty lousy, stocks can't hold gains but $VIX is down 2%.  hmmmm.
671 2018-12-13 18:55:51 Yes, I think so based on reported numbers not making sense. I agree $TSLA is a successful stock. There were many other American success stories that were successful stocks that turned out to be frauds.

I didn't know @nasa needed to learn astrophysics. But I can see that.

673 2018-12-13 18:55:43 The EU doesn't give grants for relocation. There's a cut and paste doing the rounds in which they've confused grants with loans and out right lied. They even said the EU prevents us training electronic engineers and takes our patents. But Wrexiters share with out checking as per.

679 2018-12-13 18:54:09 Did you say that when these stocks were $5 a share? You’re missing the long game in an effort to make a few bucks day trading. Will you be saying that about $nbec once it hits $30 a share?
680 2018-12-13 18:54:02 Taking business advice from a guy who found a way to make a casino go bankrupt is not a wise move. 
If he says going electric is not the way to go, BUY stocks in electric vehicles
681 2018-12-13 18:53:54 I didn't call it a scam. Its the players that make it a pump and dump. Read my

negative facts. All stocks do. End of conversation.

694 2018-12-13 18:47:16 I'm not one for calling bottoms or tops but when stocks stop going up I stop buying and start shorting. Stocks that make new highs trend higher. Stocks that print lower tend to keep dumping. Much prefer them to go up though as it's a lot easier. Irksome indeed.

He can set guidelines for trades he doesn't want done or types of investments or stocks he doesn't want purchased. That doesn't mean he's controlling it day to day

714 2018-12-13 18:38:48 It's really hard to be bullish stocks if $IWM can't even produce a minimal bounce of a major support. This is not a healthy sign for stock market breadth.

716 2018-12-13 18:38:27 War profiteering, stocks in weapons manufacturers, Saudi Arabia money, and too many senators who harbor racial biases and prejudices, undervaluing the lives of nonwhite children as less than human, are the reasons this has perpetuated and will most likely continue.

746 2018-12-13 18:28:39 NO CHRISTMAS RALLY THIS YEAR?  Usually there is a stock market rally around Christmas.  This occurs when "sellers" with gains hold off selling stocks to defer capital gain taxes o the new year.  But with most stocks down, there aren't very many profitable stocks.

749 2018-12-13 18:28:14 What about 2008, where the stocks tanked while treasuries surged (because of emergency rate cuts by the Fed)?
750 2018-12-13 18:28:01 I remember doing one about trading stocks, or something like that. It was terrible, but then more and more of them kept coming in.
I guess we're just being too harsh on ourselves because we know how tiresome it was to do it.
751 2018-12-13 18:27:46 Think of all the benefit that people who own those 30 stocks are getting! I mean, sure it's mostly the owners of those 30 companies, but it's still nice that they can now get a 42nd yacht!

805 2018-12-13 18:06:52 Some of the best #oil stocks are now trading 1.5 - 2.3x 2019 cash flows based on today's strip.  In 2014 they traded 9x; never seen multiple compression on such quality companies in my life.  Institutional capital being blown out of the space this week creating big discounts.

808 2018-12-13 18:04:52 Stocks are better than reps!
809 2018-12-13 18:04:46 downside is when you try to withdrawal ur money and they don’t let you & also don’t have customer service to call. Like yesterday. Although getting access to a savings account a day or two later is not as devistating as getting access to stocks after they already crashed
810 2018-12-13 18:04:08 What do you guys think about energy stocks? I’m betting on @SouthernCompany to pull through with Plant Vogtle.
811 2018-12-13 18:03:50 Ooh whataboutism! May being a laughing stock doesn't change anything about Trump. They can both be laughing stocks but it's for very different reasons.

813 2018-12-13 18:03:04 Dear @HeatherWheeler,

Now that Rolls-Royce have decided to move jobs from Derbyshire to Germany because of uncertainties over Brexit, how does it feel to be a proven fucking liar?

Yours sincerely.
814 2018-12-13 18:03:04 China is going to walk all over us because you can't stand to see stocks fall. Very predictable.
815 2018-12-13 18:02:47 "Someone" trying to use the #VIX to pump stocks but that’s not working either, at least so far.

837 2018-12-13 17:56:28 Depends on your inflation definition. Surely CPI hyperinflation worries were not in line with economic realities. But according to Axel Weber the value of money is reflected in all prices (commodities, real estate, stocks, bonds, FX). Here the policies play a role.

843 2018-12-13 17:53:43 Short term trading is tough long term investors should be buying and dollar cost average way. Markets and p/e’s low and probably at or very near bottom. When markets start to move they will fast up. #markets #stocks

854 2018-12-13 17:49:11 I never understood why people care about DOW, dow doesn’t even include all major companies. It’s not a good indication of the market. SP500 is a much better indicator. Idek how Dow stocks are picked cause google, amazon, and Facebook not in it.
855 2018-12-13 17:48:56 Grazed that paddock very well and cows look fit and wide well done @webscottfarm for extending the silage stocks.
856 2018-12-13 17:48:47 It could mean that Corporations didn't have better investment options than to buy back stocks. Returning capital to shareholders is typically done by paying dividends, but this alternative drives up share prices so executives with stock options get wealthier.

896 2018-12-13 17:36:01 What I’m getting at is this is not a “good” decision. It’s a rational and self-interested one, just like investing in stocks. We however don’t exempt capital gains from taxes, unlike primary residences. This is unfair, inequitable, and creates perverse social consequences.
897 2018-12-13 17:35:33 I’m not gonna start investing in stocks anymore until I’m ready to invest thousands. That’s the only way you see real profit. Earning 20 dollars in stock isn’t really exciting lol

905 2018-12-13 17:33:11 Maybe a 1% loss to bring in more profitable clients and expand # of account types (trading, etc. where they make money on spreads, stocks lending, etc.). Worth reading the fine print.
906 2018-12-13 17:33:05 With the arrest of Chinese and Canadian executives, global business travel is going to take a huge hit. This is the reason why Airline stocks are in trouble in addition to general negative sentiment in the markets.
907 2018-12-13 17:31:40 U should have stayed with the narrative that stocks were a bubble and the Fed were keeping rates artificially low. That is/was the truth.

933 2018-12-13 17:20:05 If the business environment is on solid footing, would like to ask Morneau why Cdn bank stocks are trading at valuation levels not touched since the 2015/2016 oil price lows, not to mention exhibiting a level of valuation multiple compression not seen since the Financial Crisis.

939 2018-12-13 17:16:40 Where do I sign up to be an @CNBC headline writer? If stocks are up, "markets gain on trade and fed news; if stocks are down, "markets drop on trade and fed news." I think I would be good at that.
940 2018-12-13 17:16:40 Why do i zone out when Steve Leisman is on the @HalftimeReport? Other suggestion: please stop talking about the same stocks all the time. The Najarians are the only ones to bring up new names consistently
941 2018-12-13 17:16:34 Had CNBC on yesterday to say what the afternoon fund manager guests said.  
Every single one said stocks are extremely cheap, banks highlighted. 
 Goes to your earlier post cheap gets cheaper. 
Not one of 4-5 I heard said sell anything.

944 2018-12-13 17:15:58 A fortune will be made with the mining stocks but it's still too early. Better to wait for one final "bottom" in gold (even if it's not all that far down from here.)
945 2018-12-13 17:15:11 I gotta get into stocks
946 2018-12-13 17:14:28 Political choices IMO are based mostly on likes n dislikes & not on a  qualitative and quantitative research framework like stocks.

So all sorts of personal biases get in liking or disliking someone unlike stocks.

But even in stocks too much research leads to confirmation bias
947 2018-12-13 17:14:03 Not much movement seen for Mortgage Bonds this morning while Stocks hold gains. 10-yr yield 2.90%.

954 2018-12-13 17:11:28 @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport is Terranova an idiot or what?  Has anyone on that panel looked at monthly charts of the tech stocks?  I see a lot of air underneath!  Reminds me of 2000.

958 2018-12-13 17:10:40 the emotional side of me wants to give up on all the marijuana stocks. Their weakness combined with overall market weakness doesn't look promising for the short term.
959 2018-12-13 17:10:38 I’m not really a fan of bump stocks. It throws off precision. I like making my shots count and conserving ammo.
960 2018-12-13 17:10:18 How convenient you come out now with this info.  Stocks been tanking for 6 weeks. Sec should investigate you as well

965 2018-12-13 17:08:51 We joke about amazon becoming a monopoly but when you look at the specific companies Jeff Bezos buys stocks in, its crazy
966 2018-12-13 17:08:49 Watch out for all these upgrades flooding from brokerage firms for 2019 NOW, they want to unload the rest of their positions of these long held growth stocks that they haven't sold out to you yet and let you holding the bag instead. Be careful!! $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, $NFLX, ...etc
967 2018-12-13 17:07:55 Stocks doing horrible, but we gonna stay down though.
968 2018-12-13 17:06:59 Maybe you should watch some news. There's a LOT of treachery being exposed. Cohen saying donald instructed finance crimes, Butina admitting she was directed by the Kremlin to help donald win, officials using insider trading info to buy/sell stocks...

974 2018-12-13 17:05:00 While the online matches I played yesterday wasn't bad (only lagged once per match, which also happened after I lost all my stocks) so did I buy a net cable to make sure my connection is top notch.

976 2018-12-13 17:04:42 yes.  To @SantiagoAuFund's credit, they were able to get rates, stocks & USD up for a while, but once FX-hedged UST yields went negative in late Sept, it was "Katy bar the door"...risk asset beatings will likely continue until USD is weakened for as long as those stay negative.
977 2018-12-13 17:03:54 Everyone keeps telling me how cheap the bank stocks are.  How safe and well capitalized.   

Cheap gets cheaper.
978 2018-12-13 17:02:34 It also reduces oxygen levels thus depleting fish stocks, what is a full lake without life?

Neither are small cap stocks. 
Go ahead and keep buying the soothing chatter.  Good luck.
980 2018-12-13 17:02:24 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, and it’s why the market only works for investors that have a long-term portfolio focus.

982 2018-12-13 17:01:28 Time to test my strategy on these stocks

998 2018-12-13 16:51:47 Unfortunately that large #GOPTaxScam package that you voted for has done nothing to create actual jobs. It has, however, fueled a (temporary) rise in the stock market due to companies using their tax breaks to prop up the price of their stocks.

1012 2018-12-13 16:46:33 IMO Comparison to the trading of stocks is disingenuous when eToro is presented as being in the crypto business. “Trading only” is not a feature cryp industry is built around. 
   I doubt this issue would be here if this business approach was clearly stated when offering accts.

1029 2018-12-13 16:42:00 Investors now all own the same sets of stocks even if in different proportions, so the entire market reacts to pressures that only affect portions of the market. Watch interest rates!

1051 2018-12-13 16:33:47 This is like saying you own stocks and bonds therefore you must be rich so we will tax you on the value of those securities regardless of profits forever! No income or profit test. Worst, you can typically sell stocks and bonds quickly to pay tax. Not so with a house!

1053 2018-12-13 16:32:25 #StockMarket Is fear good for stocks?  It depends upon the fundamental direction of the market.

1054 2018-12-13 16:32:13 There are stocks I invest in and stocks I dabble in. $NRZ has been a dabbler for me. Value of twitter sometimes you open your mouth only to find out how little you know.

1055 2018-12-13 16:32:13 Doesn't matter what it's worth. It's a bounce play. Many stocks are worthless but they offer bounce plays. Play the action. In and out quick with a tight risk. It was probably worth $20 when it went to $250, but it went there.
1056 2018-12-13 16:31:48 Were you able to operate the drone to get a bird’s eye view of footage of your experience? You could then edit it into a story and voilá! You get to write off your taxes the “business expense” of the dental hygienist.

1284 2018-12-13 15:07:28 Request: can someone pull what the top 5 or 10 stocks in the S&P have historically made up of total S&P earnings. 

We always see the market cap stat, I'm curious about how top weighted earnings have historically been.
1285 2018-12-13 15:06:39 I thought the commentary on low stock market participation was usually tied to the percentage of households who own stocks, not the value. Is that number still low?

Putting money into stocks and shares is not investment. Investment is in hard buildings, offices and manufacturing plants.
1457 2018-12-13 13:48:40 Wall Street just wants the individual investor to start buying stocks again so they can steal more of their money. They are profiting from these ups and downs not the individual investors. The smash and grab tax scam to steal money from the American people wasn’t enough for them.

1467 2018-12-13 13:42:36 Over the past five sessions U.S. stocks are down 1.8 percent.

But during those days, they've moved an average of 3.75%pts

(% change from prev close to day's high or low + % change from that level to the close)

This is probably the definition of a "choppy and volatile market"

1484 2018-12-13 13:35:36 @petenajarian I agree that algos also buy stocks, but investors react differently to selling vs. buying. When the algos are selling, it triggers stop-loss orders on the way down and causes panic selling. That's not a market, it is a trap for more conservative equity investors.

1493 2018-12-13 13:31:57 Think of Stocks as a Business

Stockholders/ Investors should think of themselves as "part owners" of the business in which they are investing. By thinking that way, investors will tend to avoid making off-the-cuff investment decisions, and become more focused on the longer term.
1494 2018-12-13 13:31:05 IMP: I think resistance at R40 to R41.50 will be even stronger. Through there, it opens the door for R60 to R63. Platinum stocks have resistance all along the way up, but the bigger pictures for AMS and IMP remain very encouraging.

1568 2018-12-13 12:46:41 I once saw someone drinking a hot drink with a hot meal. I called the police immediately and after a minor fracas the offender was taken away and placed in the stocks. We had a joyous afternoon throwing cabbage at him.

1571 2018-12-13 12:45:11 The combination of both fundamental and technical is probably as good as it gets in terms of picking stocks. Nothing is perfect but it has the best results imo.
1572 2018-12-13 12:44:41 Our system is long, but after the market partially closed the gap & ended at their lows yesterday, sell stops are just below the market.  Any downside will reverse our positions to short. Watching bonds for a tell. #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ $NQ_F $ES_F
1573 2018-12-13 12:41:55 It makes full sense. Recessions are great chances for capital-rich wealthy individuals and corporations to grab and stockpile stocks, real estates, infrastructure and everything is on sale, including governments.
1574 2018-12-13 12:41:39 $GE and $DB, two deeply troubled stocks (and companies), have  both bounced massively in the last 36 hours. Sentiment is bearish everywhere, and year-end liquidations are probably nearing an end. Sign of a bottom? #FamousLastWords
1575 2018-12-13 12:41:38 If world stocks grow I’m not sure our CO matters.  Market needs to see China come back and buy 5X what they have so far to matter. Otherwise it will assume SA will fill most of the gap.

1577 2018-12-13 12:40:31 Why are elected officials, especially a the Federal level, even allowed to to buy and sell stocks in individual companies whose performance, or even fate, can be influenced by legislation? It's a conflict of interest waiting to happen.

1585 2018-12-13 12:36:36 Yes.  I agree.  This will cause the US dollar to rise.  But if the Fed doesn't offset it with easier monetary policy, then stocks are going to get crushed IMO.  We have hit the point where stronger US dollar = lower stocks.   Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

1607 2018-12-13 12:20:49 US stocks need earnings. The EPS beats have been heavily reliant on buyback kickers, low int rates, lower wages, lower inflation and the tax cut boost. All of that is going away. More QE/less QT brings higher deficits/debts. Consumers can not borrow any more to consume. It's over

1626 2018-12-13 12:05:42 Many of us are trying to find the reasons for market upmove in last 3-4 days. This is too myopic and short-sighted. If you look at price movements of active and leading stocks, the stocks look tired and exhausted. The markets' trend is still not clear, prices are not cheap.
1627 2018-12-13 12:04:56 Oh by the way 0broker data intraday for stocks both cash and futures is crap because its not clean. They just send u the file as nse pushed out on that day. So u will have to clean the dataset yourself. The same with stockware

1690 2018-12-13 11:14:59 It is. My take has developed since yesterday. When I first saw it my gut said "that's wrong" - you might as well bring back the stocks! But the police got defensive so I backed down. But on closer examination, I think there may be a case to answer under GDPR.

1692 2018-12-13 11:13:50 That other argument is delusional. Housing/Auto Production/GDP w/  ZIRP/QE in full bloom is at lowest level on FRED charts since the 60s (best data this cycle is at every prior recession low). QE saved stocks, and will not next time. What will its fix and how?
1693 2018-12-13 11:13:42 WME the owners of the UFC wanted to cut costs and that what they did but if Chuck was smart he would have invested that money in an IRA or reliable stocks like Apple,McDonald’s, or another company that will grow

1696 2018-12-13 11:12:38 I agree. The other argument is delusional. Housing/Auto Production/GDP w/  ZIRP/QE in full bloom is at lowest level on FRED charts since the 60s (best data this cycle is at every prior recession low). QE saved stocks, and will not next time.

1701 2018-12-13 11:05:53 I see. Well, full auto, bump stocks, large magazines are all already illegal. But like i said the vast vast vast majority of gun violence is from handguns. I wish open carry were legal everywhere, since most gun violence happens in gun free zones.
1702 2018-12-13 11:05:42 definitely it's overall faster, you got more options in neutral, ledgetraps a bit weaker and edge-guarding is stronger compared to 4

1707 2018-12-13 11:03:59 The problem is that for Congresspeople to buy and sell stocks, even in advance of advance or arguably ‘inside’ information, may not be considered ‘inside trading’ and is essentially legal. Monetizing public service is widespread in this fashion. Laws should be changed.
1708 2018-12-13 11:03:39 Do u think this gold drop will result in a big upmove for stocks? S&P 500?
1709 2018-12-13 11:02:26 It’s good she was able to fully justify her feedback too, very difficult to argue with her logic and rationale 
1710 2018-12-13 11:02:05 Everyone on TeeVee and even respected people I know keep tryna convince me to be bullish coz China / US relations are improving. While true, why are stocks and indices not partying like it’s 1999? Just makes you wonder. Do you buy here and #believe? 
1711 2018-12-13 11:00:01 Interesting now that the hotline to BF was cut these fugazi resource stocks have not done as well as 2017.... just an observation..and also on the short tracker website there is ZERO evidence of shorts on these stocks
1712 2018-12-13 10:59:30 Are you blaming our membership of the EU for Korean conglomerate Samsung moving its plant from Harrogate to a cheaper labour market? Were we not in the EU, they wouldn't have been in Harrogate in the first place.
Also, leaving only stops the ERDF for the UK. not Poland.
1713 2018-12-13 10:57:19 I love Elon musk. He can turn any company into an empire and create a rocket ship for a fraction of the cost that an engineering company could, yet he gets destroyed by the public/shareholders because his tweets and social media posts have a huge effect on the companies stocks.

1717 2018-12-13 10:47:57 The EU probably gave Samsung grants for starting up in UK, if UK wants to shoot itself in the foot the industries will take whatever's on offer and go, it's not personal it's business
1718 2018-12-13 10:47:38 You might write back with a copy of this fatuous ‘reply’ attached and say something like “now will you listen”?
1719 2018-12-13 10:46:50 Do you think this would have happened to a French plant? A few years ago a UK company did an overnight flit from its site in France without paying workers redundancy. The gendarmes locked up the managers till they paid up. Your problems are down to Westminster.

The point I was making is that Hauraki Gulf snapper stocks have been trending upwards for 30 years.
1936 2018-12-13 07:17:42 There are no specific stocks with such exposure currently listed. They'd be such small market caps (esp in tea) if they were listed. I'm aware of some private tea operations.

2054 2018-12-13 05:27:52 @BitLifeApp this might be a stretch but it would be really cool for your bitcitizen to buy and own stocks in the stock market and when the market under the assets barcrashes your bitcitizen will become depressed or might be laid off due to this or have their house forclosed
2055 2018-12-13 05:27:50 Trading is about decision making. Decisions don't work on absolute basis. It's all in relative terms. How does it performs basis other sector stocks, in different time zones, as compared to markets, and as compared to other similar sized companies. It helps develop the context.
2056 2018-12-13 05:25:50 Why does @cbcnewsbc not address the devastating effects of fish farms on wild #salmon stocks?
2057 2018-12-13 05:23:53 Sinon étendre son linge c’est efficace aussi, et écologique  (bon faut juste bien gérer les stocks parce que c’est plus long à sécher)
2058 2018-12-13 05:23:14 Steinhoff investigation is not finished. When it is, I am sure action  will be taken against Jooste. Remember that individual entities invest money in stocks & shares knowing the risk. It's held to a different standard unlike SOE's which are entirely funded by taxpayers.
2059 2018-12-13 05:23:06 Kinda ironic that Martha Stewart was sent to jail when her broker advised her to do the same with stocks she owned but yeah no gop white male privilege to see here

2066 2018-12-13 05:19:58 Bump stocks were design to make your gun shoot faster.  Any claim to the contrary is total BS.  They serve no other purpose.  Tell me, why do you need to fire off shots so much faster?  Is that deer so threatening that you need to hit it with 800 rounds per minute?
2067 2018-12-13 05:18:44 So you get the governments permission every time you shop at Walmart?  No.  Walmart sells a lot of plastic parts, no government permission needed.  Walmart even sold bump stocks for awhile.  You hate freedom, we get it.
2068 2018-12-13 05:18:21 I went 1-2 too yesterday. I thought I could go far but nerves got the best of me.

2081 2018-12-13 05:11:43 Bump stocks were designed as a way to assist bump firing a firearm. A bumpstock isn't even needed to bump fire, you can do that with your thumb and beltloop. Also bump firing is designed to waste ammo and make noise, that is it.  You obviously don't own a gun.

2093 2018-12-13 05:05:24 Been just trading on Robinhood super easy for puts and calls.  While at work! Stocks I don’t have to check as often when in a trade! So much more volatility in stocks vs crypto atm.

2096 2018-12-13 05:03:00 Can't say I've ever driven street stocks tbh. Needs just more track time, or not going to be a good series to run?
I did my first Ferrari 488 race the other day. Didn't die but pushed way too hard, lots of off tracks. Need to calm my nerves, and just drive, not race.

2099 2018-12-13 05:00:43 Tech stocks seem much more volatile now!
2100 2018-12-13 05:00:27 In 2008 i had a lot of OTP stocks which fell from 10k to 1.3k HUF. Today its 12k. Crypto recovery is faster then stock market. If u have time and patience you will have profit. I bought 2 years ago and still in big profit. Am i stupid from a 1 year view? Maybe. And a 5?
2101 2018-12-13 04:58:37 Anyone who bought Bitcoin at a higher price then it is today can do a wash sale before Jan 1 and have a paper loss, sell and buy it right back. It’s illegal in stocks (you have to sell and wait 30 days) but not crypto (yet). In other years the price has been higher so no benefit
2102 2018-12-13 04:58:26 Big negative on that one. You can win just as easily with a cheesy ruleset like 3 stocks 3 minutes on a giant map with a fast character running away from people. Or just playing K Rool in FFA. Regardless of ruleset, GSP is shared across all rules and it's very easy to climb.

2111 2018-12-13 04:54:19 So apparantly if you sd early in the match online you lose two stocks instead of one, so thats cool.
2112 2018-12-13 04:53:31 In my opinion it is a liquid commodity and eventually could be a place to park money when other markets are bearish, whether that is stocks, or real estate. Similar to a move to bonds.

2114 2018-12-13 04:50:51 Bump stock ban
Bump stocks are worthless 
A sacrificial lamb 
You can make a bump stock at home
And how can you have eminent domain
On  a border think about that for a moment 
Maybe you should not come upnwith stuff off the top of your head but seek knowledge elsewhere
2115 2018-12-13 04:50:16 Still in the early investor stage of crypto currency.

It will be years before it is as easy to buy crypto currency as it is to buy stocks.

That is why xrp's price will be orders of magnitude higher over the next 5-10 years.
2116 2018-12-13 04:50:13 Technically we are in a very nasty Bear market (but not uncommon event on stocks -- see banks in 2008) until that happens, no bubble to be seen.
2117 2018-12-13 04:47:55 In a recession he can buy up banks for peanuts. They drive the market down buy stocks and drive it up then sell. The small investor loses. They are all crooks.
2118 2018-12-13 04:47:53 @NintendoAmerica   Looked for 1v1 with a specific ruleset (no items 6 mins 3 stocks) and i got everything EXCEPT the 1v1 aspect of it 18/20 matches. For paid internet service this is terrible. Was really expecting more of smash :/
2119 2018-12-13 04:47:31 it’s frustrating and literally i haven’t seen someone say they like the system. small things like stocks. and time are okay as long as they aren’t one stock and three minutes but.. regular stages that have hazards for online competitive matches? no thanks

2133 2018-12-13 04:38:34 It is necessary to keep in mind the overall trend of market, a stock short might not work if index is in uptrend or vice-versa , my experience says this phenomenon only happens when you have a position on or else index and individual stocks have no co-relation whatsoever

2140 2018-12-13 04:31:47 That may work with the stock market, because stocks don’t have a pulse.

2143 2018-12-13 04:29:27 Wall Street closes up, investors optimistic
US stocks closed up on Wednesday afternoon, though well below their session highs as investors pulled back in the last few minutes of trading despite optimism about US-China trade relations and some reassuring signs in British politics.
2144 2018-12-13 04:29:15 I recently showroomed on amazon. Did product search online And went to a real store and had a salesman explain features of various products including the one amazon stocks. And I bought a better product at the store
2145 2018-12-13 04:29:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2146 2018-12-13 04:28:43 The current markets which are highly volatile intact present good time to make quick profits 

Buy in Cash quality stocks where you expect bounce at key supports. Play a swing for 10-15%.

Most importantly take profits there. Don’t hold for long as trend might reverse again
2147 2018-12-13 04:28:22 @PeterSchiff how about FDX and UPS stocks? I think fact that they're kissing 52 week bottom is another indication where the US economy really is.

2150 2018-12-13 04:23:56 eh, oh well lol I'll take my chances with stocks. 
2151 2018-12-13 04:23:48 You think?  It’s bullshit that it’s allowed to happen. Stocks need to go back to specialists and fractions. Not necessarily 1/8ths but this shit is getting ridiculous. Level the field.

2164 2018-12-13 04:16:51 $7 bil could come in through the banks and FIs though, not just speculators, too to maintain $5 xrp price, right?

+ $7 bil is miniscule compared to $80 tril global market cap in 2018 USD in stocks alone, not to mention all other investments.

would take a tiny fraction
2165 2018-12-13 04:16:45 I’ve always been told by a mentor that they downgrade stocks when they want to buy your shares and upgrade stocks when they want to sell into you.

2166 2018-12-13 04:14:50 if y’all won’t shut up just go back to how stocks and value went down for entire company when 2017 happened. BIGBANG hiatus and 2NE1 disbandment on the same year. WINKONPINK can’t hold the fort as strongly as 2NEBANG did, and this was without K-POP being as big as it is now.
2167 2018-12-13 04:14:46 this was right. see financials stocks - never recovered

On top of all buying stocks and sit back waiting for dividends won't get people money they expect you have to be watching the market and trade and make money from capital gain. Otherwise sitback people should invest in mutual funds.

2195 2018-12-13 03:53:22 So I learned today I’m a sucker for a cyclical stock due to its low PE. True. And that this may be a bad thing.  Time to “learn up” on this some more! That’s what I love about investing...always more to learn...always! #investing #investments #stocks
2196 2018-12-13 03:53:08 Its time to sit idle and watch your stocks working for you
2197 2018-12-13 03:51:14 You buy stocks just to hedge against inflation, some stocks don't even move. For this next 10 years this will be the most important time to be in this space. Plus I always early adopt.

2200 2018-12-13 03:48:58 The only way stocks go up next year is the Fed ends QT and returns to QE, if necessary. 99.9% of the investing public does not understand how powerful Fed purchases of risk-free assets (QE) is and how destructive selling risk-free assets (QT) is!
2201 2018-12-13 03:46:34 Absolutely! If I had my way they would put in the stocks outside the palace to consider the effect a dark hued nail polish can have on society these days, It’s almost as bad as the time Kate Middleton wore wedge high heeled shoes! What an absolute scandal.

2235 2018-12-13 03:26:14 When they increased our minimum wage, they took away profit sharing and stocks. There’s also whispers that they’ll take away benefit matching for health benefits. So my benefit costs will double, making it to where I made less than I did before.
2236 2018-12-13 03:26:05 I’m self employed so I pay some serious taxes each year. This year... thanks to Trump, I get to pay more.  But big corporations got a nice break and used it buy back their own stocks. Now they are laying off people.
2237 2018-12-13 03:25:30 So aside from taking a short position on most of the stocks by using insider information as to how much money they owe, and being able to foreclose on businesses and homes, how would a recession help JPMorgan?

2277 2018-12-13 03:03:42 Good morning, 

Dow rises more than 150 points on trade-deal hopes, but closes well off session highs

Stocks closed higher on Wednesday as investors digested news related to the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.
2278 2018-12-13 03:01:08 Yeah, I sent you some DMs. Folks say to do that. Practice on old beater stocks and then tack the stock when not fully assembled with the gun.

2280 2018-12-13 03:00:04 Geosphere Cap Mgmt says will not chase FMCG stocks currently; like Maruti, tractor stocks. 2-wheelers & tractors to benefit from rural consumption. Would not touch public sector banks currently

I am a regular follower of your trading advices. Request your recommendation on 10 multinational blue chip stocks for long term investment.

2282 2018-12-13 02:58:07 I’m so glad I started trading stocks.. I lost 10 bands learning the first 6 months but that was the best 10 grand I’ve ever invested because I’ve learned so much from those mistakes. Good things are coming for 2019, GREAT things. God’s got us. #Blessed #StockMarket #DayTrader

2285 2018-12-13 02:53:34 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks advanced as the outlook for trade took a positive turn and the British prime minister defeated a challenge to her leadership.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.91 percent after gaining three basis points.

2287 2018-12-13 02:53:14 It's time to put limits on high frequency trading and computerized program trading.  Would a requirement that all stocks must be held for x amount of time before selling slow chaotic trading?  HF trading is about buying / selling to take advantage of min to min stock changes.
2288 2018-12-13 02:52:38 In global markets, watch the prices of the major metals. Or bond prices, or stocks.  I only ever look at the prices, since that's how they express their views.

Believe me,gulala bulala has cent percent accuracy.

2308 2018-12-13 02:33:20 They own LOTTA stocks,so if they improve the Economy 4 people&if that results in higher stock prices(note carefully the direction of "if")then they make  $$ "therefore" that "discredits" any improvement of Economy by them.Stupid argument.I vote Green.Ur ATTACKS drive ppl TO Trump

2311 2018-12-13 02:32:58 At this point, I'm pretty much inferring how #uranium stocks are doing based off of sentiment on Twitter. I don't even bother opening my brokers price updates, oh the price is unch? Wake me up after 232.
2312 2018-12-13 02:32:30 No one at the Fed ever claimed recessions were impossible. As for Congress, yeah, they do. Wall Street just wants to sell you stocks, and will lie if it has to to get you to do that.
2313 2018-12-13 02:28:22 Leading to my quantitative models looking at the deteriorating factors and not buying or outright selling them, leading to the stocks declining, leading me to getting sued for those losses. Yikes!
2314 2018-12-13 02:27:58 Anyone serving in Congress should be barred from purchasing or selling stocks, this is just one of the reasons why.

2316 2018-12-13 02:27:23 I’m also prone to extreme bouts of depression. I don’t want one in my possession.
I should reword my statement: have guns, but PLEASE get trained, keep them away from mentally ill/kids. AR-15s, large magazines, bump stocks not necessary.
I couldn’t be mad at you. 
2317 2018-12-13 02:25:48 I took seed in this over a year ago, yes blockchain and general market was a lot stronger and this listing would have been different if   timing. You making baseless posts that LM may be selling is what a cunt would do give me one of your stocks and I’ll pick holes in it

2319 2018-12-13 02:25:37 There can be multiple strategies created around this information, If you want to trade, then i would suggest divide your capital across all the given stocks. Because the cumulative prediction so far is around 65-70%. It will increase your over all probability of success.
2320 2018-12-13 02:24:16 Omg. I am so glad everyone is SAFE. This is NOT what any child or parent should have to contend with. 
Gun control is NOT taking their guns, but trying to ensure that everyone who owns one is of sound mind & body.   eliminating certain guns & bump stocks from being legal.
2321 2018-12-13 02:24:05 Sure do love setting my online preferences to 1v1, no items, stocks, and hazards off and then getting put in a match with 4 player free for all, and time with items/hazards on. Literally the exact opposite of what I want to play in Smash online

Fuck being comfortable 

I’m risking it all to win big!
2328 2018-12-13 02:17:39 No, I don't trade in any of the stocks as of now. I prefer doing trading by algo. I am not good at manual trading.
2329 2018-12-13 02:17:14 Not only that, it is easy! No new laws, no whatever. Just update a list to add bump stocks to a list of things like nukes and battleships. If a person needs a zillion bullets to hit 1 target, they need more practice.
2330 2018-12-13 02:16:57 But I’ve bought all the stock. I have no Porzingis stock. Traded it all for Frankie. Gobbled the outstanding stocks when he was going through his DNP-CD

2332 2018-12-13 02:16:31 But I don't want them opting out.

2342 2018-12-13 02:07:02 This gutter brought service tax and dividend distribution tax. So that Dividend income of super rich gets taxed at source and that too at just 10%.
Again this gutter removed LTCG. So that super rich who sell stocks after one year are not taxed a single penny

2344 2018-12-13 02:05:59 Hahahaha!!! I’m pretty sure it started with Obama but no one will say that. You can thank Obama for the laughing stock part. If we are going bankrupt then why are our stocks higher than they’ve ever been. I don’t think you know what you are talking about. Glad he’s got a backbone

2347 2018-12-13 02:04:19 Would be good to see sideways action for some time.  Big up, big down doesn't allow for helpful pattern development.

We aren't in a hurry here.   Some stocks continue solid earnings growth.  

Tactical trigger remains firmly in place.

2350 2018-12-13 02:01:47 Investor Sentiment: When the price of the stock can be dictated by the way in which the market and investors are "feeling". For example, in a "Bull Market," many would see stocks rise. In a "Bear Market," we can assume stocks would fall. This intrinsically tied to market emotion.
2351 2018-12-13 02:01:27 $FITX and/or $EAPH.  Trust nothing.  Don’t marry stocks - trade them.  I’d pay 100x more than I did for that tuition.
2352 2018-12-13 01:57:55 What happened next in Japan? THE BANK OF JAPAN OWNS 90% OF THE TOP 10 STOCKS. It's ridiculous.
2353 2018-12-13 01:57:30 Min 100K pre-market and it is important that this is not in a few candles.  If the 1 min chart is not active (i.e. has dashes with no / limited activity) then it is not active enough and there are better stocks to trade.  You can see those dashes in $PLAY pre-market.

2361 2018-12-13 01:52:54 I know what you mean. I inherited some blue chip stocks for retirement but now I can't use $$ as I planned until market gets back to 28,000 or better. Until then, I have to watch every penny that I use. There is no one else to blame except treasonous trump!

2365 2018-12-13 01:48:27 Rule number one in Peter Lynch's book: Stop listening to professionals. Any normal person using the customary three percent of the brain can pick stocks just as well, if not better, than the average Wall Street expert.
2366 2018-12-13 01:47:51 Yea the game is DUMB glitchy and buggy 
you clearly pick your color palete for a character and it changes to default thats irritating ,also if youre in a 3 stock match and you die you can lose 2 stocks from a single death what kinda bs
2367 2018-12-13 01:47:46 Yawn. As if there’s no correlation between the Dow and S&P (which represents a broader cross section of the market rather than 30 stocks) but you do you: another Trump supporting phony on Twitter. You’re dismissed.

2374 2018-12-13 01:44:05 --bad. The worst part is that if you are the first or second to lose all your stocks in a 4 free for all match, you are still not allowed to leave, even though you can't do anything and are only there to watch the match. Your penalized too for quitting out of the game
2375 2018-12-13 01:44:00 Possible consideration -- sit more of your portfolio in cash so that (a) declines don't bring stress and (b) you can buy when they happen. Biggest aim -- to always be invested in stocks for life.

2392 2018-12-13 01:32:46 My dad...same way. He had stocks that just sat there for years. He did nothing with them. It was a nightmare. My mom had no idea how much they were even worth. I understand stocks a little, so did what you are doing. Understood them a lot more afterwards! 
2393 2018-12-13 01:30:41 Maybe it is... Maybe the new pattern will be crypto crashes, stocks crash, crypto up, stocks up. Repeat

2402 2018-12-13 01:27:32 I shorted the top of the Dow, publicly on Twitter. I believe that stocks are in distribution and there is more downside coming. That said, may be up before down. I’m prepared for anything though, I don’t trade my opinion.

2406 2018-12-13 01:25:21 Purchased NBEV option this morning. Received email it was executed at 9:30 am. I had not received erroneous monies as some traders did. At 3:30pm received email that my option was cancelled. why was I not notified earlier so I could've traded a smaller position of just stocks?

2408 2018-12-13 01:25:09 That what me was thinking too. Most stocks hang around Round numbers too long for my liking

2437 2018-12-13 01:03:00 I was meaning more like into a business of your own or like stocks or something. Something that can grow into much more money, for a much bigger investment/return in the future 
2438 2018-12-13 01:02:57 Yes those rallies ends by the end of day. I just dont wanna get too bearish yet, just cautious for now. Lets see if financials can hold the lows and support tech w rally. I feel like tech stocks wants to rally. Just need help w other sectors.
2439 2018-12-13 01:02:40 I’m sitting here planning out my Christmas baking. And all the ingredients  that are required, check it my stocks and getting the creative juices flowing. I’m so excited however ... I just want 2-3 days in the kitchen with some help.

2440 2018-12-13 01:02:28 Short Sellers are on high alert to sell very strong stocks on a market selloff. Example $ANTM It hit 300 52 week highs last week and it tested 270 this week with no bad news at all. Just fell with broad selloff  Just my views bro. Correct me if wrong 
2441 2018-12-13 01:02:07 Yup I have been nervous all year about stocks crashing hard soon
2442 2018-12-13 01:01:57 LRT Why do we let congressfolk trade defense stocks at all? Seems like all federal electeds should be required to divest all national security/immigration/healthcare related stocks before they take office.

2445 2018-12-13 01:01:19 Are rising UST yields a precursor for rising equities under the milkshake thesis?  Or does it hypothesize a rise in all us assets, stocks, bonds, etc?
2446 2018-12-13 01:00:42 eh, i think stocks dump too

most big money will be in cash a while is my guess
2447 2018-12-13 01:00:25 Hmm.  After near zero sanctions Russia moves to start a really bad war, North Korea has more freedom to develop nuclear weapons, we're slowing rather than speeding steps to improve global warming, costs of living are ramping up, and stocks are crashing.  Maybe not good seeds?

2450 2018-12-13 00:59:15 So stocks going up b/c of good talks is something you’re avoiding? You’d rather go with this fear mongering story to feed your brainless sheep of an audience?

2452 2018-12-13 00:56:24 Oh, I get it. You're short $TSLA. What did you look at $AMZN and think, "damn cult stocks make no sense, but this time it'll be different. I'll risk it all."
2453 2018-12-13 00:55:55 They said they raised less money than they hoped for, but there is potential for more money to come in as projects unfold. They addressed the 37 mil & said it was just for paying people in stocks. Which tbh is a good sign to me that high level people would accept that 4 payment

2464 2018-12-13 00:45:46 Here's a classic scammer trick.  List 20 stocks in watchlist.  Later in day retweet.  Claim to have gone short any that go down.  Claim to be long any that went up... Make yourself look like a stock god.
2465 2018-12-13 00:45:23 Can I throw this disclaimer out? To the company I work for:

I invest in pot stocks so yes there are pot retweets and likes.
2466 2018-12-13 00:44:27 Painter is right, they should not be allowed to own individual stocks.
2467 2018-12-13 00:42:03 He's just whistling in the dark, Bernie. Bank stocks get crushed in recessions. Banks are inherently highly leveraged. New capitalization requirements avert total collapse, but bank earnings still evaporate in recessions when bad loans spike.
2468 2018-12-13 00:41:05 As its changing, but I been on there for years when crypto was clearly a CFD. 
As for trading stocks n fiat, definitely CFD. 
They offer a lot more than services for crypto
Its simple want to use a wallet use another service, want to trade or short sell use etoro

This rule system doesn’t work.
2471 2018-12-13 00:39:08 The only people that lost in the 2008 subprime scam were those who sold after the crash or those who invested in individual stocks that went bankrupt without diversity.  Both scenarios are investing 101 failures.  People who kept buying or held made A LOT of money.

2473 2018-12-13 00:38:09 Where do we put our hard earned $$ in the mean time?  Cash or Bank accounts (FDIC) survive? Stocks?  Physical gold/silver?  Real estate? Will cash/bank account balances be credited into/exchanged into the new currency?
2474 2018-12-13 00:37:51 If you set your preferred rules to 2 stocks then you don't enjoy the game.
2475 2018-12-13 00:37:17 I don't think it's mostly the lag. It's the god awful match making. They made shit over complicated. Smash 4 matchmaking was better cause it was simple. You either had for glory or for fun. Now in ultimate it's like teams, FFA, time, stock, how much stocks, stages. It's messy.

2490 2018-12-13 00:25:38 Fact: stocks can skyrocket on hype and speculation both on big boards and OTC.
Fact: Big boards stocks can hold all or most gains with no or minimal revenue numbers.
Fact: OTC stocks don’t hold their big percentage gains if no revenue in their financial. #wallstreetacademy

2493 2018-12-13 00:24:20 Financial advisors generally can’t just buy stocks for a client without speaking to the client and getting consent. The real question would be to see if the buy order was solicited or unsolicited. Unsolicited meaning Inhofe called his broker and told him to buy Raytheon.
2494 2018-12-13 00:24:18 I study stocks as well and I predict no one can predict a stock day by day under this administration and absolutely not years into the future.
