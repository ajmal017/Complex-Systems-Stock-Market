15 2018-06-18 23:50:13 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

46 2018-06-18 23:46:33 That's because we don't have a whole lot of solutions, and control on how many people can access them is not the answer. Restricting the sale of bump stocks and other weapon add-ons to military only could help a little, but we all just need to be more alert from now on.

68 2018-06-18 23:18:56 1. What still puzzles me is why stocks in aggregate always go up. Just look at the top 50 holdings in any index say 30 years back & look at that same index today. A lot of those companies went belly up yet the market relentlessly marches on. Understand that the survivors...
69 2018-06-18 23:18:54 Isn't it funny how the economy goes to shit under Republicans like the Bush recession & Obama a Dem had to save our economy. Jobs, the economy, stocks all on an upward trend for years, unemployment going lower every year. Trump inherited a great economy & is destroying it!

92 2018-06-18 23:04:15 Under Immelt... GE spent $93b buying back stock. 

“GE spent only $7 billion of that $93 billion from 2008 through 2011, when the stock price was mostly in the teens; the company spent almost $80 billion buying back shares at prices over $30.”

94 2018-06-18 23:01:35 You said you already knew all this remember? What 6 companies own all the mainstream media including newspapers? Who owns those companies! What are they invested in? Relationship to war? Stocks? Pharma? Monsanto? On and on they make money by what!? Exactly but you already know?

96 2018-06-18 22:59:28 The Korean Peace announcement has decreased defense stock markets. But the announcement of a SPACE FORCE would easily bring those stocks back up.
97 2018-06-18 22:58:53 Mostly true but the 'tanking' seems more like a dip to me and this might be from skepticism that he will walk this peace the way he talks it, all the way through... The valuation of stocks though and their trading prices is totally beyond me so yeah any clues there would be nice

115 2018-06-18 22:33:55 So the JODI is the wrong one. Think they maybe trying to hide some production increase that may have happened. As their exports have kept up and the stocks have not come down at the rate I would have expected to. They are fudging to make things jive.

120 2018-06-18 22:30:48 Except for stocks that go up the steepest & highest:
$AMD $W $SHOP $SQ $I $FB $NFLX $XRT
These are invincible. Their uptrends are all that matters. Bulls don't think anything can effect their growth despite fact there's no fundamental reason why their prices should be so high . .
121 2018-06-18 22:30:28 If you can demonstrate with any veracity that anything is erroneous, I will gladly stand corrected, as I'm sure will @TeslaCharts and others. But if you just say 'look, the stock price' - that is a BS argument that will not stand the test of time. Stocks are easily manipulated

126 2018-06-18 22:26:41 Hi @traderstewie, thank you for all of your posts! I was wondering, how many stocks do you have on your watchlist on average on any given day and what do you do if there are a crazy amount of stocks setting up with your setups?
127 2018-06-18 22:23:19 Including SA? I've always thought their direct reporting was honest. Closing stocks data is often accurate I believe. Production data many countries have incentive to lie, esp if it affects their currency rates.
128 2018-06-18 22:21:46 Rent a center, GALT, and SOGO affordable stocks I've had my eye on/ owned recently. Liquidated my relative pennies to spend lol. No dividends. But I'm assuming people on here lookin to play short

132 2018-06-18 22:19:23 Kobach should be compelled to resign at the Secretary of State for Kansas. Governor Colyer should call for Legislative sanctions against Kobach. The good people of Kansas don’t deserve to be deceived then made into laughing stocks by duplicitous public servants such as Kobach.
133 2018-06-18 22:19:07 PREACH. I invest in stocks that I like so much that it doesn't matter if the stock market shut down for 10 years. 
134 2018-06-18 22:17:46 I have a feeling it’s going to end badly....just like theranos. Problem is with a short  ......timing is so much more important and the asymmetrical risk vs reward can rip your face...best to stay neutral with cult stocks.
135 2018-06-18 22:17:31 Hopefully we can all unite around the idea that the next person who says “Poor Melania” deserves to be put in stocks with this statement stapled to their forehead.

140 2018-06-18 22:08:18 Bears always tried to create the illusion of no one liking or one thing the stock. Today the balls play much smarter and harder! I think more bullish moves will be soon to come this week!

149 2018-06-18 22:01:08 Many TSLA shorts were SCTY shorts that TSLA inherited, seems like most never covered. California solar roof mandate has raised all solar stocks by over 50%. SCTY is huge in CA, would be the biggest beneficiary. Between mandates and $100 oil in CA. This could get interesting.

156 2018-06-18 21:55:46 Ok I'll go ahead and guess here that after the next meltdown stocks and real estate bounce back quicker due to now ingrained pavlov response but rally half as much and then it's probably goodnight for awhile. Sorry to say this. #bearcamp
157 2018-06-18 21:55:21 @CNBCFastMoney amusing, when MO or PM is mentioned- traders will say don’t smoke but don’t say that w pot stocks. I’m neutral but consistency is a point to consider.
158 2018-06-18 21:52:52 You may want to consult your dictionary for the definition of apostate, for a start. Secondly not all of us were hurt. As @LilyPlum2 says we learned the truth about the truth. Google jws and their UN membership, or maybe about all the stocks and shares they have even
159 2018-06-18 21:51:42 Their main source of revenue is tax exempt. Profit on investments in stocks and fin'l instruments are subject to final tax which is way lower than CIT. And only if they sell and realize the gain. Not nearly enough to pay for the use of the public infra, facilities and services.
160 2018-06-18 21:51:28 @djvlad Congratulations jew vlad...big pay day for you and TMZ ....another dead blk rapper....what stocks will you buy today from the click bait?
161 2018-06-18 21:51:19 She doesn't know how it works, it confuses stocks with flows. Taxation always adds up to the same all the difference is where exactly you Tax it. It's always around 89.6 of every penny spent taxed back and the rest saved. Don't target the deficit.
162 2018-06-18 21:50:46 no one beat me in a ft3. i only did a 3rd game if someone took 2 stocks. I didn't even know it was you, just saw this name on the discord. Which I left, because the competition was whack. Maybe I'll try again.

163 2018-06-18 21:49:47 Here’s a very specific example. Trump said in an aired cabinet meeting that he wanted to raise the age to buying a gun to 21. Trump also said he would get rid over bump stocks. Trump also said he would release his taxes. How many more examples do you need to convince you he lies.

165 2018-06-18 21:46:09 I believe congressmen are allowed to engage in insider trading, however despicable it is.  Many become rich while in office because of this.  I don’t know if cabinet officials are allowed to do this, but I seem to recall they can sell stocks without the profits being taxable.
166 2018-06-18 21:45:52 I think Trump is shorting US stocks and he's making market fall with his tweets.. lol

205 2018-06-18 21:17:42 It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.  Comcast is offering Cash, hard to resist a liquid asset.  Disney is only offering stocks.
206 2018-06-18 21:16:05 I think these situations are exacerbated by two stocks where they feel much more impactful. I think keeping up with someone for 3 stocks then taking an early stock is much more deserved than taking someone's first stock then making an early rage comeback.
207 2018-06-18 21:15:50 yeah, you go take a shower and come back and blow up on stocks like this,  short.  Im long from 11.75 just before close.  Had a feeling we might see an ahs squeeze.

211 2018-06-18 21:11:31 This is the cost of the market being unregulated besides the RL. You can exploit it with buyouts that would put you in jail with stocks, but wizards might just reprint it. It's a game stop exploiting people for profit.

251 2018-06-18 20:56:30 True, but I wasn't referring to 'markets.' I'm referring to specific individual stocks. Are you claiming not one, or very few stocks prices in the market have anything to do with fundamentals? Is there a way to measure the extent this has occurred?
252 2018-06-18 20:56:08 And the stocks goes down and down. Congralutation to one of the worst stocks in Sweden this year
253 2018-06-18 20:54:58 Stocks and shares. "Floating" a company. I don't get how room full of waving ppl effect economies.
254 2018-06-18 20:54:17 So everything comes from perspective and faith? :) Economy is less science than psychology... Greed and expectations driven snowball effect. Same as inflation driven stocks bubble. Unwind of price unwinds also expectations & network value. Subjective price is the real price then
255 2018-06-18 20:53:44 I guess maybe bump stocks?

259 2018-06-18 20:52:15 So I think ima start investing in stocks 
260 2018-06-18 20:51:43 England win, I win £45 and my £3 Lidl sunglasses broke celebrating. It's coming home, it's coming home, football's coming home!!!
261 2018-06-18 20:50:27 Charging a fee proportional to environmental impacts, with proceeds shared to all people, would be an efficient & fair way to manage extraction of water from aquifers, destruction of wildlife habitat, depletion of fish stocks, light pollution, and other economic externalities.
262 2018-06-18 20:50:17 Trade tension between U.S and China  weighed on U.S stocks
263 2018-06-18 20:49:35 Ive been playing around with Stocks alot more lately and there’s a huge margin for profit & building future wealth. I encourage all my peeps to download the Robinhood app.. it’s stocks & trading made simple for young adults 
264 2018-06-18 20:49:34 Are you telling that Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, is trading stocks while he's in office and privy to all sorts of information ahead of its being made public?
265 2018-06-18 20:47:52 Trump Know Of Nothing He Speaks Not To Mention Raising Children. Something Else Ed Check Out Sessions Involvement Owning Stocks In The Detention Center In Which They Are Being Detained And Large Donors To Trump Campaign, I'm Just Trying To Get It Out There
266 2018-06-18 20:47:36 @djvlad buisness is good ....another dead rapper...turn those clicks into stocks jew boy!
267 2018-06-18 20:47:06 Yes, I agree 
268 2018-06-18 20:46:34 1D chart is looking mighty nice :)
269 2018-06-18 20:45:13 $XLF $FAS Nothing really exciting on bank stocks today, however did have a higher low and once again able to close above its 200 day average
270 2018-06-18 20:44:57 All that said, I don't support an assault weapon ban because I think it would be ineffective. It's a poorly defined term and we can already look to bump-stocks to see how easy to evade such laws are semantically. BUT
271 2018-06-18 20:44:20 Man. I know 'penny stocks' can be volatile, but I'm surprised at the price action on $VHI.V. It's not normal for a company to be a) blockchain based, b) cap under 20m, and c) profitable. It's dipping hardcore. I'm not saying I'm GOING to add more, I'm saying I'm contemplating it.
272 2018-06-18 20:44:03 Best stocks under$10 (June 18):  $BSPM, $TOO, $CTEK, $LGL, $ELON, $ISSC
273 2018-06-18 20:44:01 Just spoke someone who made a lot of money with stocks. Bought 250k in 2007 Apple - Google - Amazon stocks. Doubled in 2008 and got out before the crisis. If hè HODLd hè had 100M in 2013 and more then a billion now! Hè didnt HODL. I will #trx #tron $trx

If you got in low you might be in one of those average in average out moments of your trading career

Lots of potential in the industry. But there certainly are some overvalued stocks in the group

278 2018-06-18 20:38:31 @RMGJLR "I don't have stocks, bonds, or dividends"
279 2018-06-18 20:37:53 The market tanks because everything is overvalued. Bull markets lead to irrational valuations which leads to a collision with reality. But the inclusion criteria for NYSE is much higher than CMC. Most altcoins are worse than OTC penny stocks.
280 2018-06-18 20:36:01 happy w/ the stocks & cryptocurrency I’ve invested in
281 2018-06-18 20:35:54 Congratulations to our 6/16 winners:

282 2018-06-18 20:34:55 Look good!! My wife LOVES Stocks! Every time someone goes (only to the original place Phila) they always bring her some back. I love too but more a chocoholic, beyond normal.....
283 2018-06-18 20:34:49 Crypto twitter has become an addiction for me. More than stocks. More than gambling. I need to not spend more than 45 min daily on this. Was spending 10 hrs, mindlessly filling my head with junk brainwashing myself to the point of not being able to have a conversation with anyone
284 2018-06-18 20:32:58 Shorted any stocks lately, Wilbur? This is an Admin of thieves and #grifters, like DJT. They are amassing a fortune as fast as they can rake it in, like the Russian oligarchs they so admire. The United States of America is the mark.
285 2018-06-18 20:31:51 @jimcramer So Teach, today was clean out day.  Stepping out of the box.  Took some profits and bought some new stocks.  Time for a change.  Hope it works.  What's the worse that can happen?  I lose my a--!  Won't be the first time.
286 2018-06-18 20:31:09 yeah, there is no concrete rules in trading biotech stocks. Catching a knife that has settled on floor is not a bad trading, statistically.

292 2018-06-18 20:28:20 MAGA! Fox Biz: U.S. stocks fell to start the week after the Trump administration moved forward with plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion dollars of Chinese goods.   #ClusterFox

305 2018-06-18 20:16:38 Dow ends -103, -0.4% to 24,987 up from -265-point loss. Nasdaq +0.01%, S&P -0.2%.

A lot of cross-currents: energy, financials rally, techs mixed, healthcare weak. More strength in small stocks: Russell 2000 +0.5% to new high.

Winners top losers 16/13 on NYSE, 15/14 on Nasdaq
306 2018-06-18 20:16:37 U.S. stocks close mostly lower on trade tensions, but end off lows of the day

310 2018-06-18 20:15:20 Have you seen reports that Ross shorted stocks in that shipping company after being contacted for a story, then sold his position after the story was published?

316 2018-06-18 20:11:13 All depends if Strzok's stocks went up.
317 2018-06-18 20:10:57 World stocks fall: Europe -.8%; US -.2%. As the likelihood of a trade war moved from the improbable to the possible, markets began to take it seriously. With earnings growth over the rest of 2018 likely to slow from 1Q's torrid pace this could come to dominate market's movement

336 2018-06-18 20:01:13 What a day. ALL my stocks (including $BZUN) finishes green and my $IQ calls ripped. Being patient with my $OSTK & $TWTR Calls can’t be in too much of a hurry. Their time is coming
337 2018-06-18 20:00:35 Doesn't fit the narrative.  You can't blame bump stocks, AR-15s, or NRA members for those murders.

341 2018-06-18 19:58:27 Exactly! Global and even OECD demand has measurement problems. Higher stocks are a function of higher demand (refiners add capacity and need to hold more for operations, etc). So just use the really good OECD stock data available and call it a day.
342 2018-06-18 19:58:12 On Friday, stocks fell after President Trump announced $50 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports. The worry of a trade war is edging closer to reality.
343 2018-06-18 19:58:09 Note to self: Dump Baby Diaper

344 2018-06-18 19:57:44 great point.  200-300 shares works when trading large caps and high dollar stocks but not as easy to make good money on small caps with that few shares.
345 2018-06-18 19:57:33 Got home to a meeting between my Flatmate and his friends, all white. They invited me to join. They put money together each month and invest it in stocks and indexes. They’ve been at it for just over a year and they doing fairly well. But that’s not the point.
346 2018-06-18 19:56:08 One day the complacency in the corn market is going to be realized with bare bones stocks levels when we fail to grow a 180 yield as all the experts think is now normal. E10 will come under fire just like in 2012 #timestamp

353 2018-06-18 19:51:51 The socalled president of the US also stated that he would make sure that bump stocks would be forbidden. He could have done that without any additional Democrat's votes. But he is weak. An NRA puppet. Nothing more. Liar. Sad.
354 2018-06-18 19:51:17 One day you will see small investors who lost all their money in the market. I have already known quite a few that do not understand all of what is happening.

383 2018-06-18 19:35:21 You need better research methods.

387 2018-06-18 19:33:19 Recently, investors seem to be rotating money out of the Dow and into NASDAQ stocks (particularly Facebook/Amazon/Netflix/Google).

Could he and Arvetta just up and disappeared or were they kidnapped and killed for profit; Real Estate, Stocks and Securities, Cash and good credit? Identity Theft running rampant in good ol’ Foothill Farms. Watch out. Be very careful.

398 2018-06-18 19:29:23 I replaced half of my stocks with call spreads too.  It’s a paradox. Feeling confident with the data, but fearing the stock price action against expectation. Taking a bit cautious path.

406 2018-06-18 19:25:04 One of the reasons technology stocks have gotten so inflated in recent weeks is because investors are exiting names like $BA because of trade war fears. For the most part, names like $NFLX $AMZN and $GOOG are somewhat immune to trade wars. In other words, a safe haven...

409 2018-06-18 19:24:14 Legit question- is it legal for a commerce secretary to buy and sell stocks?  Either way, it looks like insider trading.
410 2018-06-18 19:22:15 I like simplicity of 5-year MA, but feels like a measure of market balance needs to account for demand growth (i.e. 'sufficiency' of inventory a function of market size).

But then global or just OECD demand? Only OECD stocks, but benchmark for global market?

I can go all day ;)
411 2018-06-18 19:21:16 @StocksToTrade do you have the average true range of each stocks on your screener
412 2018-06-18 19:21:03 Also think a “leader” who can make the market drop with a tweet, and then reverse it, has a beholden bevy of insiders who sell when stocks are high, take their tax breaks,  and buy back in after it tanks.
413 2018-06-18 19:20:28 Be ready to grow! Starting in 2000 I'd rarely trade stocks over $20 because I couldn't get a read. Since then, my best positions. $STUDY

434 2018-06-18 19:05:30 Its sickening to realize private prison stocks will do very well this year because of ICE and the separation of children at the border. owning a private prison stock in 2018 is like owning a piece of a slave trader in 1840.

509 2018-06-18 18:21:14 Can we just for a moment retract to the things that are killing our children in school? Will you Donald Trump ever address the promises you made to the parkland school children following their mass murder? YOU agreed that bump stocks should be banned - has that happened? NO!
510 2018-06-18 18:20:10 Yeah that was an Inverted Hammer and pretty good context after strong run up. Interesting #ETO rose again today. I think good news can take quite a while to bed into a Share Price - whereas Bad News gets in faster maybe but even such Stocks fall after.

512 2018-06-18 18:18:43 Except they have. Hence the low unemployment and 2.7% wage growth the last quarter (which is small but beginning to pick up). buying back stocks doesn't go on forever even if some big companies did that. And most small mom and pop shops aren't even public.
513 2018-06-18 18:18:20 Stocks halt trading when companies issue news releases to allow all investors an equal chance to get the news.  Then a few hours later they re-open and stocks can plummet or soar.  Not sure what TSX you are watching.

A poem should be blindfolded

590 2018-06-18 17:38:16 Interesting take,  however this article is overstated. i.e. Sega stocks are fine at opening. Also to say this has nothing to do with Fortnite is a bit misoverstated and not proven per this article.  Let's see what happens when the entire Asian index goes up like I bet Sony is.
591 2018-06-18 17:37:45 If the vast majority of people are holding it and there is very little velocity that liquidity becomes non-existent. That's also ignoring the fact that money held in a store of value like gold or bitcoin is not doing productive economic work like money held in stocks or bonds

666 2018-06-18 17:01:33 STocks like $GEVO are the reason why i love trading.  Beautiful, fluid, organic, clear direction, liquid.  Haven't had one of these in awhile
667 2018-06-18 17:01:29 @armyranger $LRCX Nothing that I would touch. And so many other better stocks to be in here with momentum.
668 2018-06-18 17:01:18 Love when stocks are ripping and the market is down.
669 2018-06-18 17:01:12 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
670 2018-06-18 17:00:45 It depends on your profit numbers. I’m a dividend growth investor, but also hold shares in AMZN and GOOG. I’ll never sell these shares. Imho, you’ll be fine owning some FAANG stocks.

681 2018-06-18 16:54:46 I was trading very heavily during the 1998 through 2001 dot com bubble and this January 2018 crash is down to the T of what I remembered.  It took 4 years for the tech stocks to come back with billions coming in from Wall Street and it still took that long to recover.

683 2018-06-18 16:54:18 There are two questions for one answer so I will reply here. Lots of negativity on market in media. As for me, I love the stocks in my portfolio and am looking to add on weakness. I will not get shaken out. The long term horizon is positive for US markets.

687 2018-06-18 16:51:57 She should put her $$ where her mouth is and pay reparations back to the taxpayers. She should 1. Pay us back the exact amount of her stocks that were so important that she defrauded and lied to Treasury and also the exact amount the US paid to bailout out HER bank.
688 2018-06-18 16:51:49 Hmmm 6th branch of the military. Remind me why we were all selling the defense stocks again? Do you really need anymore proof at this point that money is and will continue to flow into the sector?

702 2018-06-18 16:48:22 Mortgage Bonds begin the week near unchanged while Stocks are lower. Floating is recommended.
703 2018-06-18 16:48:12 In the past, I've ridden some of these up, and then so quickly big part of it down. I'm now selling sooner, eg $ETSY,  as well on strength and will evaluate the result later in a few months when we see how the extended stocks end up.

734 2018-06-18 16:35:58 Is there a good market reason that short-selling stocks is legal?
735 2018-06-18 16:35:57 Sure like making the right investments for instance investing in high profile companies or stocks and shares using proceeds from investing in the lucrative transport sector or business to invest in the real estate sector with high returns

741 2018-06-18 16:33:34 Two takeaways from today: Oil tried to sell off, then bounced back over $65. The bad news from OPEC may be priced in. Also, gold should be rallying better than it is. That said, my portfolios are generally up (thanks, oil and drone stocks), so I won't complain.
742 2018-06-18 16:33:29 They will get blown up.  Are you suggesting that they can't manipulate stocks anymore?

Americans with guns are your problem. Not immigrants. 

US not safe for kids.
746 2018-06-18 16:32:44 Nice! Maybe less stocks & more pentool 
747 2018-06-18 16:32:13 That's what I mean by "tanking the economy." They have the US military, they're not scared by Cletus and his rifle collection. But if threatening their bottom line, their stocks, their investments, their power, that's what they care about.
748 2018-06-18 16:31:55 Guns? "We should be paying teachers, not talking about putting guns in classrooms . . . It's a public health issue," says @sharicedavids who also calls for ban on bump stocks and clear definition of assault weapons. Now @kcur
749 2018-06-18 16:31:47 Universal background checks, no more guns equivalent to AR-15s, no more bump stocks, etc.
You will not agree I suspect.

760 2018-06-18 16:27:30 Although a lot of the comments r inspiring I think Jim meant abt the market. The right stocks r leading, financials even turned thru the day, and GOOGL lead and started the rally in tech just as u said. New highs coming after earnings season IMO

762 2018-06-18 16:27:16 The Sri Lanka Rupee dropped to 161.00 against the US$ means stocks & money market would also drop further. On the energy front, crude prices extended falls from late last week amid speculation that major producers are drifting towards easing production caps #lka

770 2018-06-18 16:21:21 One of the cool things about the media being obsessed with Tesla is that I'll turn on the news and see that my stocks have gone up in price yet again. It's great stuff.
771 2018-06-18 16:21:12 Look there is nothing wrong with being $100 into the green . BUT IF you have done your DD and are buying quality undervalued stocks with either assets, niche, or intellectual properties, then all you need do is BUY and HOLD! Are you willing to wait 2-3 yrs for a 10,000% pop?
772 2018-06-18 16:19:14 Summer break. Day 23. Nutella and glitter stocks holding steady. Rising temperatures threaten to drive us inside but access to 583 Disney channels should provide adequate entertainment. Dog is still intermittently incontinent. Mood is cautiously optimistic.

794 2018-06-18 16:04:24 Two stocks I recently sold out of way too early: $AMD and $HBI
795 2018-06-18 16:03:11 Don't be fooled, both sides are both holding these kids hostage to get what they want. Depending on which bias you want confirmed is how you're going to tweet about it. I'd like to know why bump stocks haven't been addressed. I've yet to hear from anyone for those.Just ridicolous
796 2018-06-18 16:02:59 So long as the economy is good, no price is high enough for stocks. The Dot Com bubble was not a "bubble". The period after was people being ridiculous and like not paying up any price for stocks. In fact, normal stock PE really should be 2000 because you can always get to 3000.

846 2018-06-18 15:41:00 Agreed. GM% pressure, market saturation, some new competition, Brexit, issues with French roll-out (tho I think that's going fine), and general low interest in European stocks.

849 2018-06-18 15:40:10 I dont look at any technical indicators. Just the volatility, probability of profit and premiums. That's because I believe that markets are mean reverting.

859 2018-06-18 15:35:28 The best growth stocks take years to materialize AND give you fantastic gains along the way.

Eg. $SQ has been a top holding in our client model since 5x ago and I'm not sure when we will pull it. Not yet.

Doesn't mean a stock won't have a bad year (look at square postIPO)

1087 2018-06-18 13:53:19 It’s asinine to point to overall rates. The issue is what the natural rate would be without any given population’s presence. It’s quite common for individual groups to change in opposite directions to the trend. “Stocks are up 10%” does not imply that some stocks are not down.

1161 2018-06-18 13:20:20 Exactly right.  They are selling exactly what is going to go up Multi-X.  But they are probably selling since they have lost about 90% of their value with these exact stocks.  They dont understand that the same equities will put them right back where they were.  My 2 cents.

1166 2018-06-18 13:15:53 Short-term volatility and losses aren’t the only risk of stocks. Concentrated portfolios can go long periods w/o a return premium:

1186 2018-06-18 13:07:11 Only average up on winners that are in profit instead of adding more to losers. That way your biggest position sizes will be on stocks that are already in the green.

1190 2018-06-18 13:04:57 Do not pay attention to growth versus value discusions based on backward-looking multiples. Such analysis as arbitrary as comparing stocks that start with A to those with B. Most backward-looking factors that are “cyclical,” likely just spurious. Value is relative to price alone.

1224 2018-06-18 12:52:08 Domestic benchmark equities ended lower today. as concerns about a global trade war turned investors cautious, with metals and information technology stocks coming under selling pressure. However, gains in oil and auto stocks capped the fall.

1488 2018-06-18 08:57:09 Chart based.. If your metric is watching only index for strength then index mgmt might confuse you. When market turns these stocks which show weakness fall like pack of cards. That's what happening last one year. Check all the down swing. Mostly happens straight 3/4 session.

1490 2018-06-18 08:56:34 Correct but In case of a crash whether both Stocks or MFs will take a beating. Unless you can actively evaluate & track individual stocks, MFs are a better option. Timing crash as you’d agree is close to impossible, closest you can do to benefit is have cash handy when it happens

1495 2018-06-18 08:48:00 It's not very difficult if you can spot value in low growth stocks. My point is that high growth is usually more than adequately priced in whereas low growth is often underpriced. Case in point the midcap IT space 6 months back.

It still has deep liquidity and the perception of safety.  Of course we know the reality.  Bonds appear to have peaked;  stocks rigged by ESF but for how long?

1609 2018-06-18 06:29:33 Stocks aren't going to crash this time. My bet is a public asset meltdown is coming down the pipe not a private asset collapse. Private assets are really set to take off. If bitcorn takes a silver of the bond market money it'll really take off along with US equities and metals

Gold may go down in price for a while and dollar cost average your position into it. Cash and precious metals may be your best bet. Stocks are high risk.

1930 2018-06-18 01:19:07 Do you know just how stupid that sounds? People here out of work? Stocks failing? You are no doubt one of the most selfish people. Your hate is so caustic you don’t care who this hurts.
1931 2018-06-18 01:18:32 Record high stocks, lowest unemployment in 40 years, jobs coming back to America, more take home pay, a Scotus justice who actually reads the  Constitution, many foreign hostages released and perhaps peace and denuclearization of the N. Korea.
1932 2018-06-18 01:13:19 Beautiful! Fake news! Lol
1933 2018-06-18 01:12:07 So INVESTMENT BANKERS sell stocks to the masses?!?!
Your complete and utter ignorance of the markets, economy and history is truly epic!
1934 2018-06-18 01:11:48 Let me guess. Interest rates up, inflation slowly goes up, market slowly comes down. Companies not making as much money, PE ratio increases, stocks over valued, causes correction. People put their money in value stocks & value cryptos. (No, I am not an investment professional.)

1940 2018-06-18 01:02:08 Began investing last week. It's exciting seeing stocks grow. Though I am looking forward to begin investing in growth mutual funds for my long term investing.

1943 2018-06-18 00:59:15 I just went through 2 pots of @TigerBalmCanada this week for my back. I feel like I should either invest in it’s stocks or be sponsored. (PS it’s helping!)
1944 2018-06-18 00:57:57 Saw that story, too. Check your 401k. Good chance we all own one of those pharma stocks.

1952 2018-06-18 00:49:44 You'll never become a real, consistently profitable trader until you can trade without following alerts or advice from any website/chatroom. If you don't think you can make money in the absence of others, challenge yourself and grow until you can.

1960 2018-06-18 00:36:24 I’ll help by saying that bump stocks don’t kill that many people compared to how many people pass background checks they shouldn’t pass.
1961 2018-06-18 00:35:50 I started full time and they would lay people off like a month before their 1200$ stocks would beat.
1962 2018-06-18 00:35:35 I did 8 because if sm4sh was 3 stocks, it’d be 3 stocks 8 minutes, and therefore creating your 2 hour sonic rosa scenario
1963 2018-06-18 00:35:33 What's with the negativity they have a good product from what ive heard it was bad management....every penny stock is a huge risk i dont see how this would be any different....
1964 2018-06-18 00:29:18 I 100% agree.  I'm so sick of the people in the shadows manipulating stocks, crypto, politics, medical, & fake news, misdirection. All done by these 1%.  Hoping Trump exposes these powerful elites w/no hearts & false truths.
1965 2018-06-18 00:27:09 Yes! I always vouch for as fresh as possible. We have such a nice market street not far from my home that stocks fresh fish that looks amazing! Fun fact: they stocked shark a few years ago and I bought some and cooked it. Was great and not very normal lol
1966 2018-06-18 00:26:51 Right after the boo’d God at their convention?
1967 2018-06-18 00:26:41 Yeah, I'm sure they traveled all the way up here for our sweet stocks and bonds. Did that sound as stupid in your head as it does when being read?

You're making the claim, either support it or admit you're making shit up to justify you being shitty person.
1968 2018-06-18 00:26:23 I was under-performing for a long time.  I had a good deal of Twitter stock which is doing extremely well this year.  I also had some oil stocks that have done the same.  

My 3-year performance is probably still under the S&P by a bit.
1969 2018-06-18 00:25:18 European stocks fell on Friday as investors showed renewed concerns over a global trade war.
1970 2018-06-18 00:24:29 ... and don't forget your body armor and bump stocks!

1973 2018-06-18 00:21:40 Local shares are off to a flat start to the week. #ASX 200 +2pts to 6095 with gains countered by heavy losses in mining & energy stocks #ausbiz
1974 2018-06-18 00:21:00 Industrial stocks also saw heavy losses as Caterpillar sank 2.0%, General Electric declined 1.6%, Boeing retreated 1.3% and DowDuPont slipped 0.9%.

1976 2018-06-18 00:20:33 Basically, After a stock gets a lot of momentum I'll keep it on watch and continue to monitor to see if it catches momentum for a 2nd leg or a good trade
1977 2018-06-18 00:20:32 US energy stocks were among the biggest movers as crude-oil prices fell on expectations that OPEC and its allies will agree next week to boost output. 
ConocoPhillips plunged 4.1%, Halliburton dropped 2.4%, Chevron fell 2.0% and Exxon Mobil slid 1.5%.
1978 2018-06-18 00:19:50 US stocks fell on Friday, but ended well off the lows hit earlier in the session, as investors looked past signs of escalating trade tensions with China as president Donald Trump approved tariffs on about $50 billion of Chinese goods.

1987 2018-06-18 00:14:26 Again, this is the kind of "breaking" news that could make the marijuana stocks really jump.
1988 2018-06-18 00:14:21 Precisely. Took decades to strengthen. 3 billion people are coming online in the next 20 years.

They can either put their funds into closed source money and stocks or open source Bitcoin and tokens.

1990 2018-06-18 00:12:47 The lack of common sense flat out delusional their truth is based on feelings not facts
1991 2018-06-18 00:12:25 It’s because the NRA doesn’t compromise on common sense safe gun restrictions, assault weapons, Bump stocks, background investigations, gun show exceptions. The National Guard is the State Militia. Outlaw assault weapons, minimum age of 21 after training, full backgrounds!
1992 2018-06-18 00:12:07 When long-side breadth is strong, this is letting you know that on avg, stocks are being bid up, breaking out and following through.  Odds favor going with that momentum, no matter what.  When long-breadth thins out, that former buying power is gone and the odds are much lower.
1993 2018-06-18 00:11:41 Nothing seems to be helping your stocks.  Plank was questioned on CNBC if he would buy back his stocks... crickets... 

If Plank won’t even buy his own stocks, why should we, the investors’ have confidence.  Plank needs a little of Musk’s backbone.
1994 2018-06-18 00:09:36 don’t trade TSLA or stocks BUT HATE LIARS
given extensive experience on Wall St through tons of episodes like this, both firms likely have in common serious miscommunication re regulatory events/cap limitations. U have ax to grind “buying flamethrower cars & likely long shares”
