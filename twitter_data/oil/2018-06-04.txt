1 2018-06-04 23:59:54 Sven, if you need a job you can light my cigars and pour my beers.  We can discuss tennis and art. How did Rembrandt conceive all those dramatic scenes in oil and what to say to a tennis star to alter her game a little so she doesn't fire you after the match! I'll stick with art.

Given that CA/SCL defied ICO Enforcement Order on full disclosure we have no reason to assume that we are examining a lawful disclosure. The argument of snake oil is itself snake oil.

9 2018-06-04 23:58:43 Gas prices have nothing to do with President. Oil is traded on the open market. Gas prices set accordingly. But you keep on saying that it’s Trump’s fault if that’s what fits your narrative.

11 2018-06-04 23:58:32 Actually thinking about it the best way to move forward would be to use some oil export revenue to fund new tech and renewable energy resources and then reduce the need to export oil and export tech and renewable energy.

All the virgins eagerly await the Bridegroom but five of them are foolish and when He comes, they aren’t ready. It’s not enough to start with oil in our lamps. We need enough to last until He comes.

If you can't be bothered to do basic research before debating, I really don't have the inclination to be your tutor.
Remember who has the oil wealth in the UK before you spend money that might just belong to Scotland.
68 2018-06-04 23:51:06 my sister wants to buy this face oil and at the same time she’s planning to do her own and right now she’s trying to come out with justifications on why she has to buy the face oil. She’s thinking hard

72 2018-06-04 23:49:35 What about the Saudis contributions to the HRC campaign? You ok with that @LouiseMensch ? Or is this a double standard thing? Oil companies, big pharma, military contractors, and unions all have PACs to help elect their preferred candidate. That’s how politics work. Sad but true.
73 2018-06-04 23:49:28 And the oil companies have taken over the EPA
74 2018-06-04 23:49:27 At this point, I smell Phantom Smoke more often than not. Sometimes the only way to maintain some semblance of my sanity is to smear peppermint oil up my nose to mask it for a brief reprieve. I smell like a candy cane, but it's better than a non-existent cigarette.
75 2018-06-04 23:49:16 Okay, that just made me smile.

111 2018-06-04 23:43:33 Oh god. Okay, so a few reactions:

3.) Is he really going to go for- OH GOD KILL IT BEFORE IT LAYS EGGS #cringe #tytlive
112 2018-06-04 23:43:22 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
113 2018-06-04 23:43:14 Sure it is possible. No big deal with the potential and the technical feasiblity. Only the costs are disputed strongly and why not counterasking: What will it cost if we don't do it? Do you remeber the costs of triple digit oil prices and the economical effects?
114 2018-06-04 23:43:13 Could a set percentage of oil revenue be earmarked for infrastructure?
115 2018-06-04 23:43:07 And my check engine oil level came on.....that can be fixed but LAAAAAWD ANOTHER SIGN THAT I GOTTA BE RESPONSIBLE

121 2018-06-04 23:42:39 I love #creationism

It's my FAVORITE cult, snake oil, pseudoscience which hucksters LIE to #Christian-s to about to make bank.

You know, like @aigkenham & @kenthovind 

As I told Kent on his podcast in 2005, if I wanted to make quick money with NO morals, I'd be a #creationist.
122 2018-06-04 23:42:10 Because he cared about the enviroment right?  Not because big oil lobbyist? Right?

124 2018-06-04 23:41:39 It's not "producing" anything; it's a pipeline, not a well. It is simply transporting oil that was already being transported, but it's doing it along a cheaper but more dangerous route, crossing a major river in order to increase profits.
125 2018-06-04 23:41:18 I swear to god I could have my leg amputated and my Aunty would still think she could fix it with an essential oil.
126 2018-06-04 23:41:15 Just don’t fry it in a bunch of oil! BBQ or grill it  or in the UK we have this 1 cal spray called “fry lite” which is amazing!

129 2018-06-04 23:40:39 What a myth! These actions were taken against communists during the Metaxas era. His security forces gave castor oil to a few select arrested communist leaders of the illegal then Greek Communist party. Castor oil was too expensive for widespread use. Cod liver oil was cheaper!
130 2018-06-04 23:40:38 I got my oil changed and returned two shirts that have been sitting in my car since April. #adulting

135 2018-06-04 23:40:05 Which is why there should be a research and development project funded by Provincial Growth Fund studying self referrals of oil and gas workers to find solutions for future work. The problems, limitations, pitfalls.

137 2018-06-04 23:39:55 Electricity is purchased at the same rate from private and govt companies. CPPA owes dues to private and govt companies. 

Case in point, private companies are selling electricity at around 13rs on furnace oil. Quaid-e-azam solar which is govt owned is selling at Rs16

144 2018-06-04 23:38:22 lavender oil?
145 2018-06-04 23:38:07 No, they won't. In CA, oil is a major player in Dem politics. How? They Don't give to the GOP and they Do give to initiatives.
146 2018-06-04 23:38:06 I made a spectacular profit on an oil stock, all short term. Shares went from $1-$3 I sold, $1-$6 I sold again, shares dropped again to $1, bought, went to $3 sold, stayed out. They struck a huge oil supply. Share went to $30. I was out. My third lesson, why sell on no news?

152 2018-06-04 23:37:44 Saudis and Russians knew this was coming... their talk of recent days was to head off such news spiking oil to $100 and impacting global growth (in Saudis worst case scenario....growth declines just before Aramco IPO).
153 2018-06-04 23:37:19 Ok it's a thing, but mayo is nothing more then egg yolks and oil, a touch if vinegar, and salt. it comes into play whilst making the batter. You substitute the mayo for the oil and eggs in the cake batter then you bake it. The mayo doesn't have a Flav in the cake just super moist

156 2018-06-04 23:36:39 A "dying industry"!?  Lol just watch ANY Financial News Network or read a newspaper Lizzy, oil and gas usage around the world is still climbing, and will for years!

As Canadian's we are losing billions by selling it cheap to the US, so they can sell it at world market prices!
157 2018-06-04 23:36:11 Oil more than $75/barrel. FAIL
158 2018-06-04 23:35:57 Yeah they could have done a study. It would have shown what everywhere else has shown.
Indigenous communities are always harmed by the oil industry.
NZ is NOT that special.
I'd rather they spent time on say, HNZ policies, where we really do have differences.

163 2018-06-04 23:35:24 Palm oil is unhealthy anyway.  This is a form of greed. Humans know nothing about moderation or being stewards of the planet.

167 2018-06-04 23:34:58 Couldn't agree with you more. Be up front and tell me how you're going to tax us to pay off the "deficit", how you're going to create "jobs" that pay minimum wage and how gas prices are going to continue to rise in the face of unprecedented profits by huge oil conglomerates

179 2018-06-04 23:32:10 There are no new greenfield projects planned after TMX.   This is a question of how not if oil will be shipped based on existing projects.

236 2018-06-04 23:25:33 Put it to work figuring out how 340 million Americans allowed themselves to be fooled into accepting a story of 4 disappearing jet airplanes, 3 disappearing High-Rise Towers and the invasion of a poor Country with the World's 3rd largest oil reserves.

242 2018-06-04 23:24:13 Eggman owns factories and what has to be the world's largest oil reserve, has a monopoly on extreme gear (owning both major manufacturers: Robotnik Corp and MeteoTech), and clearly whatever Eggman Enterprises does is enough to fund an interstellar amusement park.

288 2018-06-04 23:17:43 Are you seriously suggesting we need to confirm every finding in NZ despite mountains of data worldwide?
Not just CC but also hazards of oil extraction?
I'm confused?

293 2018-06-04 23:17:16 Amazon also thinks I want to buy neem oil. And competitively-priced meat grinders. And dance shoes. And some rainbow dice. And a guide to Dark Souls Remastered, a game I do not own. ??????

Purchase history, 2018: dog shampoo, flea spot treatment, kava powder, a book about moss.
294 2018-06-04 23:17:08 all i want is a full body massage with hot oil 
295 2018-06-04 23:17:04 It's probably just a stripped down hemp oil that doesn't contain any cannabinoids at all...therefore, it's not actually cannabis oil.

299 2018-06-04 23:16:56 I appreciate your tweet game. But just wondering, is the oil & gas lobby among your clients, or are you just raising these issues as a concerned citizen.

302 2018-06-04 23:16:16 It sounds like we've been paying them to do business with us. Oil is the only import I can think of that carries with it, a great deal of special handling.
303 2018-06-04 23:16:01 In case anyone missed it, leaked Clinton emails have revealed that the Libya invasion was about oil and currency.

305 2018-06-04 23:15:45 Exactly, I helped my Dad replace the oil pan only.  Think there was a trip to Pick-A-Part place involved too.
306 2018-06-04 23:15:41 yea, that makes sense. Although, come to think of it, I think all cannabis oil in NY is still illegal, though I could be wrong. Cannabinoids like CBC & CBG won't make you feel anything at all, but CBC, while not psychoactive, will make you feel numb.

335 2018-06-04 23:12:19 There is no longer a safe use for fossil fuel energy. Atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases is at 410 ppm and rocketing. Oil is obsolete and will become a stranded asset. Time to join the world in a vast transition to abundant, free, renewable energy.

354 2018-06-04 23:10:17 He's only slightly wrong. Hydrogen can be captured as side-stream product from O&G.

But what would you do with the other 99.5% of the oil/gas?
355 2018-06-04 23:10:15 in my opinion this thing goes way beyond the oil & money. I see what matters to most people is the autonomous power of Sarawak which is either ‘gone’ or not being used fully.
356 2018-06-04 23:10:10 OMG lol, please say ya onky had to replace pan n oil, and your valves and rockers etc were still good to go lol
357 2018-06-04 23:10:07 It's a proven FACT that a container ship will go farther on a barrel of maple syrup than it will on (the more normal fuel of ) bunker oil. Smells better too!

Sadly, Canada has not been able to convince Maersk to "make the switch" due to the phenomenal increase in costs involved.

407 2018-06-04 23:03:49 Higher margins as well. Profit may be north of $2/g. They're going big on extraction/oil in their Ancaster location. Multiple edible-deals announced past two weeks
408 2018-06-04 23:03:49 Lemmeeeee tell you what to do for that I’ll get you the oil I had to use when I did it
409 2018-06-04 23:03:36 As global transport converts to electric/renewables we should expect the oil industry to pressure society into using more and more plastic and chemicals as alternative markets for their product. This needs to be forestalled.
410 2018-06-04 23:03:31 You’re building a pipeline for one reason, to expand oil production. The Alberta oil sands are North America’s largest source of air pollution. You are spending billions to make it even worse. Have some respect for the intelligence of the electorate. Stop lying.
411 2018-06-04 23:03:27 Worry more about the implications of Oil and Gas cessation being a completely  dictatorial  edict.
412 2018-06-04 23:03:12 CBD oil, not only does it help me sleep but also it helps a lot with other health aspects.
413 2018-06-04 23:03:06 I hate not having an oven thermometer when trying to decarb cannabis for oil. I’m always paranoid my oven is way off.
414 2018-06-04 23:02:57 Hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking) which Halliburton holds the patent is more about privatization of water than extraction of oil and natural gas. Carlisle group (Bush investments) hold water rights in S. American countries where fracking is banned. One hand washes the other.
415 2018-06-04 23:02:53 I’ve upped Kid1’s not-yet-magical fish oil to two doses a day, as it’s been three weeks and I haven’t really seen any change. In another 3 weeks, I’ll add a different one, maybe. Then maybe some magical(ly expensive) vitamin powder. Still not convinced it’s not some scam.

424 2018-06-04 23:00:38 So convince the rest of the world (US, China, India) to stop using coal/oil, I'm sure Canada will follow suit until then, this little pipeline being less than 1% daily production amount to nothing for GHG
425 2018-06-04 23:00:34 Dont forget..increase in fuel prices translate into the prices of other goods and services. Yet we are an oil exporting country
426 2018-06-04 23:00:22 FISH OIL called super nutrient is destructive abuse, inevitably processed so dusty of buried bodies, “cancer” being previous life dead rotted, underwater substances beng inaccessible when we evolved digestion, oil being fat which is what bodies make of Unabsorbable junk so toxic

430 2018-06-04 22:59:38 Hindu nationalists called fascists for fighting Islamism. Will sold out media like Guardian riddledby Islamists start calling patriotic Brits Christian Fascists now? Tommy Robinson and othrs have been ringing the alarm bells for years but oil money induces deafness in politicians
431 2018-06-04 22:59:34 In our household, we put Adobo and olive oil on practically everything.

And we like it that way.

434 2018-06-04 22:59:05 Couple of cream crackers some pickled onions oil and anything close to cheese. Tomatoes are close to cheese as is bread. Oh, and wine. Fry the onions in the oil, add cheese or equivalent and heat slowly, pour over toasted equivalent of or or just bread. Balsamic vinegar can help.
435 2018-06-04 22:58:55 Is that why you and ol’ @JustinTrudeau , Canada’s newest oil magnate, decided to buy Kinder Morgan’s failed pipeline?

Time to stop bullshitting Canadians and just admit you’ve no intention whatsoever of honouring the Paris agreement. JFC.

I just can’t decide which is a better option...
490 2018-06-04 22:50:47 No argument here, I agree. We don't get the benefit because the elite make too much money on oil and wind.

510 2018-06-04 22:46:43 Acrobatics covered in baby oil OMG this will be a hilarious video I’m sure shdks
511 2018-06-04 22:46:35 Canada performs above average compared to other North American and European countries on 11 of the World Economic Forum’s 12 pillars of competitiveness and average in 1. Investment is up in every sector except oil and gas. But sure, let’s bankrupt the country for the fun of it.
512 2018-06-04 22:46:34 Yeah it's best to keep the  oil the same the lifetime, Unless you played in performance parts on it to drive a really hard
513 2018-06-04 22:46:12 back at it again with the baby oil
514 2018-06-04 22:46:03 It is consistent to simultaneously believe:
1) we should do more on climate change
2) the oil industry wildly overhype their economic contribution to NZ
3) making long-term policy on the fly is a goddamn shitshow

518 2018-06-04 22:45:44 I’ve done the math and it works. We need a People’s Budget—Tax big oil, big pharma, big insurance, Wall St, billionaires, millionaires, profiteers, etc. Also, stop giving them our tax money in subsidies, tax cuts, special favors, etc. Again, it’s really that simple.

One says that's where she buys her CDB cream. Other says she tried their THC oil but it didn't do much for her. I say, "Me neither."
536 2018-06-04 22:43:21 You're thinking of United fans, Liverpool fans, Arsenal fans when they lose (watch Arsenal Fan TV to rule them out immediately, Gary). For a neutral, Spurs are the best club. We aren't run by oil money, we promote youth, your place in the team is based on loyalty/hard work.

550 2018-06-04 22:40:58 Possible but I like to take things step by step. Not one of those guys calling 55 oil 50 oil etc. I take it step by step. Or years ago those clowns calling 3000 Gold from the top of Gold. Good luck to you Sarah..
551 2018-06-04 22:40:56 Do you feel like it caused any greasiness afterwards? Like I know castor oil is great too, but I hate that it’s going to take so long for it to not have this residue

Butt naked, oil, and fire
603 2018-06-04 22:32:39 You just confirmed you are hyper- hyper-ventilating with the killing off the oil industry tweet. Plus ignoring the imperatives of addressing climate change.
604 2018-06-04 22:32:28 Do your homework. Sanders is so left and so full of crazy he'd have made Trump seem normal to the average voter.  A GOP campaign against him was ready made:  Sandinista rally, Castro support, women's rape fantasy, broaching the idea of nationalizing the oil industry, much more.
605 2018-06-04 22:32:15 But that's stupid, how many are these Kurds, you're going to blow oil in the region, when everybody else is waiting on it (Russia/Syria/US/Europe?) just because of your hatred of this small group, how threatening could they possibly be?

612 2018-06-04 22:31:36 Still doesn’t justify our high pump prices tho lol. We’ve got one of the highest worldwide and it never decreases when oil prices go down . They claim it’s cos we are subsidized when prices are high. Still not good enough excuse when the govt takeaway is such a large %
613 2018-06-04 22:31:33 SHE WISHES he would just go away… What Happens when MANAFORT heads up River on his 200+ years of charges… PLUS the Other Ones for instigating the #Rosneft Oil Deal.

616 2018-06-04 22:31:20 The point of shampoo is to remove dirt and excess oil from your hair, and the point of conditioner is to add moisture. Lmao you can't do both simultaneously.
617 2018-06-04 22:31:17 People on YouTube are so triggered by me using oil in my food lmao
618 2018-06-04 22:31:10 With all the cruise traffic, is it possible that there could be collisions with US oil tankers bound for Puget Sound?

628 2018-06-04 22:29:56 why in the HELL would somebody even purchase citronella essential oil?? take that shit off the market
629 2018-06-04 22:29:56 I guess they would rather sit and collect money from US oil companies than work.

634 2018-06-04 22:29:38 President Macron says tariffs are an insult - that France is not a threat to US Nat Security. Same France that denied flyover to USAF attacking Hadafi/Libya - for fear of loss of oil.  Really Macron, ignorant of your own history.

641 2018-06-04 22:28:08 I'm fairly certain no self respecting business owners should ever put a Z at the end of their business name. UNLESS they are trying to cater to children.

Toyz for Kidz? You're okay.
642 2018-06-04 22:28:06 "What country would leave 173bn barrels of oil in the ground?" Is that what you mean by "clean and green"? If we burn those 173bn barrels, Canada with less than 1/2 of 1% of the population of earth, will have used up 30% of the remaining global carbon budget to stay under 1.5

645 2018-06-04 22:27:45 Next we will read that @fordnation had secret meetings with Donald Jr,  Kushner and Russian oil Oligarchs to help him push out the Board at Hydro One. Now that would be a good story! We should get #SgtRenfrew and his fearless dog Cuddles to investigate both stories.

650 2018-06-04 22:27:11 I'm always looking for some new oil to try, I'll check it out!
651 2018-06-04 22:27:06 I just remember when I was home and working close the dealer would come get my car for oil changes fill out the check from the cup and bring it back with the receipt. 

That’s service
652 2018-06-04 22:27:06 Trump cheats on his,wife while she's weaning his last born son and constantly verbally lust after his own daughter . And this snake oil salesman has the audacity to try and condemn a women who says a word he called Ms. Clinton thousands of times? This truly is bizarro World
653 2018-06-04 22:26:57 The enemy can’t steal your oil, so he makes you think your oil is small so that you won’t use it. When the need is greater than your perceived supply you won’t pour. The oil only flows when it is poured. Pour today! hitthemark #pour

655 2018-06-04 22:26:43 people who moisturize their faces with coconut oil are brave
656 2018-06-04 22:26:41 Plants dieing from a normal life cycle will rot away. The only reasonable explanation for the huge oil/ coal deposits is a catastrophic event that layed down huge forests and covered them with mud. In other words a huge flood.
657 2018-06-04 22:26:08 The good news: In the not too distant future, when renewable energy is dominant, oil will be worth virtually nothing.
658 2018-06-04 22:25:56 I am lucky to count the few genuine and self brewed intellectuals (yet broke ass souls) I met along the way who pulled themselves out of "changing car oil and having babies" world, amongst my best friends and my husband. People who survived,like me,only by the skin of their teeth

661 2018-06-04 22:25:24 Clean and Green communities? Does that include Vancouver and Burnaby after an oil spill from a pipeline that your government wants to force down our throats? Clean and Green? A PIPELINE - old and leaky to boot. And a new one that will add the equivalent of 8 mill cars to GHGs?
662 2018-06-04 22:25:08 Many fleet and oil field trucks actually get banned or softly pushed out of carwashes.

To much hassle with the extreme dirty and contamination risk

670 2018-06-04 22:23:12 Are those all for oil? And how many go to tidewater? The reason Trans mountain pipeline is important is the market access. Do you really want to make trump our only trade partner for our oil? Look what he is doing to NAFTA #ableg

674 2018-06-04 22:22:39 Teeth Whitener

Swish around a few teaspoons of coconut oil in your mouth for 5-10 minutes to remove toxins from your teeth and gums, this will make your teeth look whiter.

688 2018-06-04 22:20:36 The knack of cooking noodles. Should be dry and separated. A very hot wok and little oil but has to be smoking, and obv a non stick wok helps. And always add wet ingredients at the end. Or its a sticky gloop.  And yum to Shirataki. Hard to cook right. Its like vermicelli.

708 2018-06-04 22:18:00 I do kava tea for my migraines. It makes me a little woozy but it's the only thing that's worked so far. FYI you have to add a fat to it like coconut oil or full far milk.
709 2018-06-04 22:17:56 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
710 2018-06-04 22:17:44 did you smell the weed oil & float over to the windowsill like in a cartoon
711 2018-06-04 22:17:25 Lol my house usually stays cool. But when the oil is dripping I know the weather is tripping
712 2018-06-04 22:17:19 Dow closes up over 100 points, NASDAQ closes at new all-time high, Twitter being adopted by S&P 500 and the stock rips over $2, $AMD showing strength above $14 level, $BABA rips and oil trading lower. Love this current market. #Stocks
713 2018-06-04 22:16:54 The Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles, where there are no lakes. The Oilers moved to Tennessee, where there's no oil.
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don't allow music. The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A. And then back to Oakland. No one in L.A. Seemed to notice.
714 2018-06-04 22:16:45 My phone banking is going great - flipping undecideds for Stephanie  like Burgers at MickeyDs.  Dems hate big Oil and Gas from out of state trying to take this race!! #TeamSGR #NoToMunoz #NoToGVK
715 2018-06-04 22:16:42 Forget oil and gas. It's old tech.
716 2018-06-04 22:16:34 Green doesn’t generate high paying jobs. Oil does. Start supporting your union workers.
717 2018-06-04 22:16:33 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
718 2018-06-04 22:16:08 Who painted this women's face? Is that Oil painting? 
719 2018-06-04 22:16:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, however Libya.
720 2018-06-04 22:15:56 I cannot tan for shit, I have bought tanning oil, I’ve gone outside and laid in the sun for hours... and all I’ve got is a sun burn and skin cancer.
721 2018-06-04 22:15:23 Bet we couldn’t find any virgin olive oil lol
722 2018-06-04 22:15:08 Ir's the intent that is evil, the all in one day.. I think May is frightened of democracy, of a groundswell of sentiment against Brexit. She must push it through before people get what a shambles it is, like a snake oil salesman.
723 2018-06-04 22:14:46 Longer Eyelashes

Coconut oil can help stimulate growth and lead to longer lashes. Combine a tablespoon of coconut oil with one drop of lavender oil. Apply the mixture to your lash line each night with a Q-tip.
724 2018-06-04 22:14:39 I was so confused as to why my oil change is higher for my car than it was for my suv and my friend that works at Chevy said it bc i got a brand new car 
725 2018-06-04 22:14:34 How abt olive oil *and butter

727 2018-06-04 22:13:30 Why can't the Easterners team up and get oil blocks first before fighting for Biafra.
728 2018-06-04 22:13:30 I need an oil change and I’ve been working up the nerve for a week to call out there but it’s got me no where
729 2018-06-04 22:13:16 Be transparent at least.
What you really mean is NIMBY.  We have the cleanest and highest standard of extraction etc.  Nope you want invariable oil needs met by foreign oil where you don't have to bother accepting it's a much worse option.
730 2018-06-04 22:13:16 To help rooting of about anything, you can use Rootone powder.  It normally has some adfitives to help keep fungus down, but it is just basically willow powder.  Mixing some crushed aspirin and neem oil or leaf powder might do as well.

732 2018-06-04 22:13:01 wouldnt mind you helping with the washing n I've got oil too so it can shine after you rub 'em.
733 2018-06-04 22:12:50 You clearly don't see that the US is only in the war and oil business. If you think your government cares about your well being you are living with blinders on.
734 2018-06-04 22:12:40 I love going to the dealership and they are confused that you don’t want an oil change. “So you get an oil change at this service.” “no thanks. it’s a [Bolt/Leaf/whatever]”. “You sure?”....last time I just said “yes” to the oil change; figured I’d let them have fun with that.
735 2018-06-04 22:12:33 Io uso Bio Oil è fenomenale, ho visto proprio la differenza
736 2018-06-04 22:12:33 Donald J. Trump is a conman, a liar, a cheater, a grifter, a snake oil salesman and a D-grade celebrity obsessed with his own profile.

742 2018-06-04 22:11:56 Roseneff shares for big oil deals? Stuff like that?
743 2018-06-04 22:11:48 A bottle of liquor and/or some cigarettes will get you the best oil change in town 
744 2018-06-04 22:11:43 Dandruff Treatment

Apply coconut oil to roots and massage your scalp, this will send moisture to the roots, this will get rid of dandruff. This also stimulates hair growth.
745 2018-06-04 22:11:38 Sprayable vegetable oil spread is literally the best thing in the world #spraybutter
746 2018-06-04 22:11:22 We continue to mortgage our future so that oil, gas and coal companies can extract a few more dollars out of the ground for shareholders.
747 2018-06-04 22:11:14 Took the truck to get an oil change at my dads fav shop and while I was there the guys goes “your dad already called me and told me to do a good job for you”  my dad always looks out for me no matter how much we argue 
748 2018-06-04 22:10:45 The botulism risk of storing wild garlic in oil due to not being able to pasteurise is often discussed among foraging instructors. It’s a small risk, but a very real one. For this reason I won’t keep wild garlic pesto for longer than 24hours.
749 2018-06-04 22:10:28 You might need some oil
750 2018-06-04 22:10:20 I bother! I’ve been burning the midnight oil myself!
751 2018-06-04 22:10:14 Oh girl, and how could we forget rosemary infused oil! Okay, it's time for you to get your craft hat on and hit up Pinterest.
752 2018-06-04 22:10:13 Oil on water is good
753 2018-06-04 22:10:08 1/3 cup Soy sauce, 1 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup lemon juice, basil, parsley, minced garlic, white pepper, garlic powder.. it’s very good. I’d maybe throw Teryaki on it too.. maybe next time.

760 2018-06-04 22:09:28 Stay the fuck out of other country’s and worry about America, America needs more attention than other country’s, and instead of killing innocent people to get all the oil and gas in the world, you can be nice and they will give it away...
761 2018-06-04 22:09:13 MY President.., Please, make sure cartels are kept OFF that project.. Plus revive Oil refinery in Mombasa so that we export both refined products and crude oil to maximize revenue..
762 2018-06-04 22:09:10 The Koch brothers were wheeling and dealing, of course not entirely legally, during the 50s and 60s and 70s and most of the 80s making money off of polluting the land with oil wells and some of their chemical subsidiaries.

766 2018-06-04 22:08:52 They all seem to be the same size rad?
I have a file of many types. Turbo Star is the full set, oil cooler and intercooler included. 
I think we recorded a 125 cooler group. Sort of upside down funnel ?
767 2018-06-04 22:08:50 1. It’ll be challenging to ramp up production fast enough to shock the system.

2. Oil industry as % of world economy not big enough to cause significant slump. Renewables take over that segment. 

3. Increased productivity elsewhere as energy costs drop.
768 2018-06-04 22:08:48 Evan Davis's view of the 70s is hard-working businesses being bullied by greedy unions, when in truth they weren't investing and were preparing to dump whole industries for city shenanigans and being advised by Milton Friedman to do a runner with North Sea oil wealth. #newsnight
769 2018-06-04 22:08:46 shower was bomb letting this hot oil treatment sit in my hair!

772 2018-06-04 22:08:09 I may be wrong but wasn't the signature target of a snake oil salesman the Chinese railroad workers. Why doesn't Trump step down and pick up a trade that he is very good at?
773 2018-06-04 22:07:41 So, something I didn’t think would actually do any good but tried it randomly and now I do religiously: apply magnesium oil/lotion sometime after working legs. REALLY helps with the pain! I’m a heavy lifter too. It’s the only way I can function now!
774 2018-06-04 22:07:32 Please explain what happens if we have an oil spill from US Tankers?! At present we don't have any spill response. Thanks to KM they have agreed to PAY for a base at Beecher Bay First nation land to clean-up potential spills! Let me guess the resident orcas don't want this!

776 2018-06-04 22:07:26 Under Eye Cream

Use a dab of coconut oil on undereye bags and fine lines. It will reduce the appearance of them and It's light enough for the most delicate skin on your face so it will not irritate your skin.
777 2018-06-04 22:07:09 Plus the oil don’t forget which colin rarely mentions for some reason
778 2018-06-04 22:07:02 Like I had the worst migraine in the world felt like my head was going to explode I took a pain reliever cause I was out shit was still bumpin for hours.. the second I get home I put peppermint oil under my nose and on my temple and my migraine disappears

785 2018-06-04 22:05:55 South East Asian merchants often traded cane sugar, oil, textiles, cotton, steel, etc. My family came from trading household goods, French dish, later modern/plastic textile. The entire market was overthrown by cheap Japanese ware. @adamlevine @realDonaldTrump @jrridinger
786 2018-06-04 22:05:54 Haha you don't know for sure. On an average people earn abt 1800-2000 cad in canada and bus fare for 1 or 10 stops is $3 which is equal to Rd 150/-& Petrol is $1.40 per ltr when canada is oil producer and its equal to Rs 70/ ltr

790 2018-06-04 22:05:13 Would you agree that there are broader societal concerns about the impacts that the oil and natural gas pipelines transport has on climate change?

Mix one cup of hot water and two tablespoons of coconut oil. Massage it onto your scalp, comb it through and wrap it into a bun. Let it sit for an hour, then wash your hair. This will make your hair super shiny.

796 2018-06-04 22:04:35 No but I am gonna be a Piazza Hyundai on Thursday for an oil change and now I can’t stop thinking about pizza.
797 2018-06-04 22:03:57 Yes. I created a bot to troll backwards shittard oil shills to bring down big oil and prop up Tesla which actually will never make sense. Then I bought Tesla stock, shorted Shell oil stock, and am now retired, riding around in my self driving Tesla, laughing at your tweets.
798 2018-06-04 22:03:55 In the particular case of oil permits, what is the evidence you think needed to be considered (other than whether there's any govt liability for not issuing new ones?). Seems a "who we are as a people" sort of decision, much like nuclear free.
799 2018-06-04 22:03:53 food from yesterday was left on the stove and it was just bones and oil along with a half eaten slice of cheese and a knife! not a fucking butchers knife or some shit no, it was fucking a silverware knife, ones you use for display

805 2018-06-04 22:03:26 When will gas and oil prices come down???
806 2018-06-04 22:03:25 is there really anything better than exfoliating using coconut oil?
807 2018-06-04 22:03:24 The saying black men like darkskin women in oil refers to the exoticizing of darkskin women. Whether they're thin or not, the fact that they have to be editorialized to be seen as beautiful in a way that lightskin women don't, is the point. You missed the mark severely, sis.
808 2018-06-04 22:03:18 Stop the BS about god giving you the right to own firearms. It wasn’t my GOD that gave you the right. And mine is the only GOD. You can’t quote chapter and verse because my GOD never said anything like that in the Old or New Testaments. Go sell that snake oil somewhere else.
809 2018-06-04 22:03:14 What official advice is that? The Ministry of Oil says more oil exploration would be a good thing?
810 2018-06-04 22:03:13 Been at Walmart for a 2 and a half hour oil change  wtf
811 2018-06-04 22:03:12 I went to hartland before to get an oil change and the guy goes “I bet you don’t know what year or make your car is” & I was like “actually it’s a 2014 fusion asshat” never again...

816 2018-06-04 22:02:50 I like oil paints and yeah I'll be sure to check out your string and you'll see me in there one day it's just hard to work around my schedule but I'll figure out something and it's nice to meet you
817 2018-06-04 22:02:39 No one made their own clothes from product they grew so everything in the photo is an oil product. Even if the cotton can be argued to be non oil, the dyes for the colours are derived from oil.

819 2018-06-04 22:02:30 I swear some mechanics go out of their way to make you look dumb.
Like I wanted to say, “No, bitch, it hasn’t been 40,000 miles since my last oil change & I tell you motherf*ckers every time to update my records. Hence the post-it on the dash.”
820 2018-06-04 22:02:29 Allah ya ida nufi may he be ur strngth... Wishin the evry best. Rikadawa my home.
821 2018-06-04 22:02:29 Oil prices r rising. No wall paid 4 by Mexico. No repealing n replacing Ocare. No lowering of rx drugs. Those were the 3 main things Trump promised. Either he’s a liar or he’s incompetent. He has an all repub house n senate how could he not get it done? Loser!
822 2018-06-04 22:02:29 Interesting. This our oil & gas mkt and murky dealings. OML 30 (and other blocks) was under NPDC operatorship via its SAA with the defunct Atlantic Energy. Curious to still know how salvic entered the equation.
823 2018-06-04 22:02:13 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
824 2018-06-04 22:01:55 @Kia vehicle was purchased because of perks like free tires and maintenance only to find out that all dealers wont accept U.S Warranty. Was told I would have to travel and go to orginal place of purchase to have oil and tires done..so very disappointed in your company!
825 2018-06-04 22:01:44 The stove was so fucking dirty and there was an open spilt bottle of olive oil on the counter and dishes from 2 days ago there
826 2018-06-04 22:01:42 Seriously do you all walk into a @McDonalds and ask for an oil change for your cars?
827 2018-06-04 22:01:37 Olive oil is the best start to any meal!  #CarapelliParty #Sponsored
828 2018-06-04 22:01:33 Interesting. Does it discuss the damage the NDP did to the oil patch, primarily jr oils, by doubling the LMR and crushing the ability to clear deadwood oil companies as a result of the Redwater Energy Corp challenge that forced more wells into the orphaned well category?
829 2018-06-04 22:01:29 I have to start taking fish oil pills and I just opened the bottle and the smell alone made me gag. How in the world am I going to take these every day?
830 2018-06-04 22:01:28 Do you use essential oils? What is your favorite oil?
831 2018-06-04 22:01:27 RT TribeCBD "RT codiminnick: U guys CBD oil is amazing! I don’t have this irrational fear of someone I love dying anymore! My anxiety feels controlled lol"
832 2018-06-04 22:01:18 Should say - combined means sequence, not mixed together. First toner then oil.
833 2018-06-04 22:01:04 Dam nigga replace yo shit wit supreme brand oil
834 2018-06-04 22:00:55 So just for fun for those against pipelines.  Food for thought. 

Although it is smaller in diameter than the proposed KM line, and it is full of natural gas and not oil, you know there is a pipeline going each and every house that uses gas for heat...right??
835 2018-06-04 22:00:47 - Olive oil

841 2018-06-04 22:00:19 I used to oil the hinges on the door so it wouldn't squeak when I'd sneak out 
842 2018-06-04 22:00:15 The only word in that tweet that resonates, is "crime", you smarmy,  snake oil sellin' shithead
843 2018-06-04 22:00:13 Right. The best way to lower oil prices is to increase the supply of oil. Supply and demand.
844 2018-06-04 22:00:10 Also the oil leaks and overheating problems but I still love them.
845 2018-06-04 22:00:06 Taking my car to get new brakes on Wednesday I can’t wait for the mechanic to realize I put 1500 miles on the car since Thursday when I got an oil change
846 2018-06-04 22:00:01 #NASDAQ makes new highs as oil continues its fall and the other indices make gains.
847 2018-06-04 21:59:53 A person paying for entitlements/illegal immigrants and an agency and a person receiving the money. Who do ou think is going to squeal the loudest when cut off? Like a dry hinge...that is why we have oil...to stop the squealling. #OilLiberals
848 2018-06-04 21:59:52 Algeria Energy Min expects global crude oil prices to stay between $75 and $80 a barrel after #OPEC meeting: APS. #OOTT
849 2018-06-04 21:59:45 I feel so greasy. I've just had a shower and put aveeno on my body, beauty kitchen abyssinian halo mask on my face and vitamin E oil on my eyelashes
So much oil
850 2018-06-04 21:59:34 Nsw is reliant on electricity from other states & sometimes we export electricity to other states.  No state has ever with held energy.  
NSW is  dependent on Qld. No one is  about that issue. AGW requires us to transition out of gas.  Ditto coal and oil. Energy reform reqd
851 2018-06-04 21:59:25 This guy is a snake oil salesman be careful if you by his rhetoric it may destroy your mind he is totally a Democrat the cancer in our government it's clowns like this mainstream media spewing poison to the rest of the DNC citizens blinding their free will to choose

At least oil companies aren’t in it for the money.
854 2018-06-04 21:58:59 6. Norway is the 15th among countries with oil while Nigeria and Angola are in position 13 and 14 respectively. Norway is the richest country in the world and give 1/3 of profit it makes from oil exploration from african countries; Angola and Nigeria included as "aid" and used
855 2018-06-04 21:58:39 Hey @JustinTrudeau if you can help oil execs get 1.5 mil bonus, it would be cool if  Services Canada would stop auditing me for a $50 correction I REPORTED on an EI claim 5 years ago. If I got a 1.5 Mil bonus maybe I wouldn’t have been on EI! #madforever #bonus #TransMountain
856 2018-06-04 21:58:36 No we dont need new oil/gas
But we need to replace it
Ardern and Shaw gave no replacement

Otherwise Hydrogen would have been mentioned and uses existing skills already in Taranaki - so no job loss and  new fuel source that is 100% clean
857 2018-06-04 21:58:21 I dont wear cologne , just beard oil
858 2018-06-04 21:58:12 So... My crafting career has begun. 

We have a booth at a show a few towns over in two weeks.

I'm working on two different things, the essential oil diffuser necklaces and the ribbon/elastic/button bookmarks.

Everything is either here or on its way.
859 2018-06-04 21:57:39 Doing the mayo, egg, & olive oil treatment on my hair. This shit stinks 
860 2018-06-04 21:57:33 2/2 I have seen nothing yet IN NUMBERS that suggests we can double oil sands output/emissions AND reach our Paris commitment.  If this is indeed possible @cathmckenna ... please share the math with us.
861 2018-06-04 21:57:09 Hypothetical oil exploration in the future isn't going to help with that.
862 2018-06-04 21:56:52 instagram makeup tutorials are mixing a $9 foundation with a $72 facial oil
863 2018-06-04 21:56:48 for cramps or pepople with IBS it probably works quite well for them. Ive never personally seen the suppositries that he is talking about but I know a few people who use the oil for muscle pain and arthritis
864 2018-06-04 21:56:46 Highlighter 

Mix coconut oil with liquid foundation to give to make your skin look dewy and to keep it glowing. Or, dab a small amount directly onto your cheekbones and cupid’s bow for a subtle highlight.
865 2018-06-04 21:56:27 I forgot my CBD oil at home today. I just left the gym and my back feels like it’s about to snap in half. I honestly didn’t know that it works so well to this extent.
866 2018-06-04 21:56:15 Bostol cough syrup mix half a bottle of linseed oil. A teaspoon in the morning and at night, dnt forgert to shake before use. Works like a charm.
867 2018-06-04 21:56:06 Been putting that much stretch mark oil on so I don’t get any that it’s marked my bedding 
868 2018-06-04 21:55:58 Given the steep discount for our oil going South one would wonder if the US would be investing more $$$ up here.

I am curious to know just how much that discount helps the overall bottom line for the US.
869 2018-06-04 21:55:54 When Kia has your car from 9 am till 4:30pm only to say they dropped my oil and cleaned dpf , no diesel in oil , yet they didn’t over fill it ! So ...... where’s the other oil come from ????? Feeling confused
870 2018-06-04 21:55:54 We also have plenty of oil!!!
871 2018-06-04 21:55:52 From what I heard, she just does baby oil videos or something, but no actual “porn” porn
872 2018-06-04 21:55:47 Yea. That’s cute. So for bad economy In obama tears was due to bush and Booming trump economy is due to Obama ?!! Try selling that snake oil  to an actual American voter. !!
873 2018-06-04 21:55:45 HA!! I’d make you watch YouTube ghost videos with me, after we vaped THC oil in the bathroom.
874 2018-06-04 21:55:44 I have a feeling this oil change finna take forever 
875 2018-06-04 21:55:38 Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
876 2018-06-04 21:55:37 poor marky boy the boy just wanted to show  his improvement in cooking eggs look my companions ive remembered the oil
877 2018-06-04 21:55:33 how many oil changes we talkin 'bout?
878 2018-06-04 21:55:33 basically its not weed its something called CBD which is found in the cannabis plant but doesnt get yout high like THC does, you get a very mild buzz from it but it has really really good pain relieving powers. Its probably in oil or mixed with some other type of butter
879 2018-06-04 21:55:24 HOT Shiatsu Shiatsu Massage Oil Massageöl Body Öl Bodylotion Körperpflege...
880 2018-06-04 21:55:16 My oil change use to be so cheap in my little red car lol
881 2018-06-04 21:55:10 Je me couche après avoir mis du tea oil sur mes imperfections et de l’huile de ricin sur mes cils je suis intoxiquée et aveugle mais je me sens bien.
882 2018-06-04 21:54:58 I really don’t wanna pay 50 bucks for a oil change 
883 2018-06-04 21:54:57 Just picture in your minds eye the 3 of them cuddled up on the bear rug in front of the fire place with a bottle of wine and a gal of strawberry flavored body oil.....
884 2018-06-04 21:54:52 drilling makes our beaches stink like oil, Tons of tourism in NJ. Also they always seem to leak and cause massive disasters. Also you seem to imply that Wind Turbines don't require maintenance, monitoring , updates etc. Wind is ultimately cheaper and safer and also feels good

886 2018-06-04 21:54:28 I wash, exfoliate, and use rose oil and jojoba oil every day. Rose oil helped clear my skin up soooo much!
887 2018-06-04 21:54:24 The fact we were 200MW away from the national grid falling over last week and that the emergency diesel/oil generators were going all last week and Vector was load shedding
888 2018-06-04 21:54:21 ...But defintly bein abl to trust ever-reliabl H, alwys burng midnit oil. The focus on radical black pastor. The embrace of mass incarceration & drug war, abandonment of poor w/ welfare reform, giving into racist stereotypes in 90s. H & B a team. He worse; she still complicit. 2
889 2018-06-04 21:53:56 A close family member recommended some oil for my cervical cancer. Told me to rub it on my cervix instead of the surgery. . . . She meant well. But.  Gotta love psuedoscience!
890 2018-06-04 21:53:52 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
891 2018-06-04 21:53:52 Lianne, if it is refined oil, it does not have to be declared as an allergen. It would show in the list of ingredients, however. If it is an aromatic or roasted oil, which is allergenic, it should be declared as an allergen.
892 2018-06-04 21:53:41 Ooooh I love how coconut oil makes my skin feel 
893 2018-06-04 21:53:38 Feckless Pr*ck! You are in hock to the Russians and doing everything you can to bamboozle the idiots who buy your snake oil. And BTW flipping burgers for a few bucks an hour -- wow! Great time to look for a job!
894 2018-06-04 21:53:26 Oil king with the reads.
895 2018-06-04 21:53:13 Come come...delivered by mistake, oil workers can't read long words, anyway it's full of Brexit bigotry...huh, you're both welcome to each other, we wouldn't want uneducated Neanderthals dirtying copies of our NS with their oily hands, Penny...have you seen this....?
896 2018-06-04 21:53:03 Mineral oil and gravel on my face. Only the best for my skin

898 2018-06-04 21:52:47 $SSYS trying to bottom as well. Signs of life in areas of market that have been dead for years. Such as this one, oil tankers, fiber optics...
899 2018-06-04 21:52:44 Vitamin E oil
900 2018-06-04 21:52:43 Lol one time I was on hennys and somehow got oil in my eye
901 2018-06-04 21:52:42 Andrew, Whoever is advising you should be fired.The pipeline is good for Canadian workers ,first nations prosperity, ALBERTA. What is wrong with you? You do you want Canada return back too Harper recession times? Why are you not defending the oil industry?
902 2018-06-04 21:52:34 I know S.A. government a really high oil price, but if it only costs Saudi Aramco $9 to produce then they will keep producing and selling well below the cost of Alberta production -  until they implode as you say.
If MBS gets it, then what hope does AB have as a sunset producer?
903 2018-06-04 21:52:32 Me (when packing for travel): "I need to make sure I pack all of my hair care essentials. Hair dryer, flat iron, shampoo, conditioner, heat protector, Moroccan oil, hairspray, gel." 
Also me (after landing): "Ouuu there's a hair salon within walking distance." (books appointment)
904 2018-06-04 21:52:32 15 years ago, an engineer told me that we would look back and think we wasted all that oil by burning for energy when we could have used it for so much more
905 2018-06-04 21:52:26 i just sautéed zucchini & squash and marinated tomatoes and red onion in red wine vinegar & extra virgin olive oil and put it on whole wheat panini bread with spinach avocado and spicy mustard and grilled it and it was the best thing i’ve ever tasted

907 2018-06-04 21:52:09 Orang bikin homemade deodorant, bahannya coconut oil, clay, beeswax, sama baking soda dll. Ternyata pake vco nya aja udah lumayan
908 2018-06-04 21:52:03 Domestic oil production is on pace to set a record in 2018. That being said OPEC can still manipulate prices by raising or lowering production amd by the same token, removing the oil from an entire nation from world market lowers supply which raises prices.
Inliterally
909 2018-06-04 21:51:55 Yes. #Select brand, they have a website, accepts debit. I've purchased from them, ship to your door. They have 1000mg CBD oil in 30ml bottle. Like $65 per bottle. I don't have insurance either. Make sure to check out @GoodRx top. I save about $500-$600 each month.
910 2018-06-04 21:51:51 My oil light kept coming on when I started the car & I thought it was b/c last time I had it changed they didn't reprogram it .i was wrong lol
911 2018-06-04 21:51:49 Riding Huge Dip/oil stick
912 2018-06-04 21:51:37 I wonder if I can ever get my drivers license back, one justification for all that Saudi Oil that flows into Louisiana and a payoff monetary exchange rate for the refinery gasoline based on the end product rather than the source of the petro.
913 2018-06-04 21:51:29 The opening of said Barbie murder featured just a hand in an elbow-length black glove (me) dropping an aspirin in a champagne glass filled with [wait for it] CANOLA OIL because I didn't know how else to fake champagne at 10 years old.
914 2018-06-04 21:51:29 Crews will now work on changing the oil in the Electra’s Wasp engines, checking the landing gear and other components. The aircaft will also get a complete wash down as the moisture of the preceding week has caused the Electra’s shiny aluminum surface to become dull.
915 2018-06-04 21:51:26 Not familiar with your situation, by any chance did you do a sponsorship for CBD Oil? 

Youtube terminated a huge swathe of channels who were, but some got them back after they complained enough

Good luck regardless,  mate
916 2018-06-04 21:51:19 Finally getting my oil changed... good luck chiseling that shit out

920 2018-06-04 21:51:01 Not only did @jacindaardern  not consult scientists, industry, or the public about her unilateral, off-the-cuff, spur-of-the-moment decision to end oil and gas exploration in New Zealand, it turns out she didn't even ask Cabinet.
921 2018-06-04 21:50:57 You have 30 million living in Saudi depending on a decent oil price... I recon Canada would survive without tar sands but Calgary be at lot smaller
922 2018-06-04 21:50:49 Bro I swear everytime you get an oil change 
923 2018-06-04 21:50:43 Why VZ  BBolivar e-coins, LLP need to be collateralized bby oil leases that are encumbered as collateral, so at any time holders [Turban]....
924 2018-06-04 21:50:41 And the decision to bypass cabinet and cosponsor anti-Israel UNSC2334 alongside Malaysia, Senegal, and Venezuela.
Is there cabinet manual requirement that oil decision go to cabinet?
925 2018-06-04 21:50:31 Are u hiring for your kustopo brigades also?  Just to fore those who dont tell you how good you smell with putin oil?
926 2018-06-04 21:50:26 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
927 2018-06-04 21:50:17 What's the surprise? Oil exploration has to stop and should have some time ago. It's the bare minimum. Cabinet should be now looking at how quickly NZ can end existing fossil fuel use and extraction, and meet the very real challenges of climate change.
928 2018-06-04 21:50:11 olaplex is a godsend but also coconut oil mask helps and moisturizes your hair too!
929 2018-06-04 21:50:07 The lines are already Drawn Dick , the last time they were redrawn was your party while it stole 6000 miles of Scotlands North Sea.

Ye kin Run , but ye canny hide fae the fact Labour enables and protects London wealth creation proclaiming it socialism - with an eye on oil.
930 2018-06-04 21:50:04 so many comments on content regarding more eco-friendly reusable consumer products talking about hanging gas & oil execs and like.... im MORE than down to slander polluting companies and
931 2018-06-04 21:50:02 Regarding the fact your leading circles hold investments in oil and weapons I'm delighted DT is a friend of efficient deterrence and minimal war action. North Korea looks like a splendid example. Also hate campaigns contra Moskow are not in Europe's interest.
932 2018-06-04 21:49:45 3. I am very sure they cannot allow this nonsense to happen in their countries that one family manages everything. A good example of how terrible the black gold(oil) can be is Nigeria and Niger. Delta state was the first oil field in Nigeria and they still produce, but as opposed
933 2018-06-04 21:49:38 my cat keeps wanting to lick the coconut oil off my skin
934 2018-06-04 21:49:27 Oh crude oil ffs

936 2018-06-04 21:49:18 Stupid. Really stupid. Jobs galore in the clean power industries. The fossil fuel companies don't like it. Trump has investments in oil. Say no more.
937 2018-06-04 21:49:17 olive oil on the tiles will buy some time
938 2018-06-04 21:49:11 I'm wondering why @RepErikPaulsen would even take money from Big Oil.  It's not there are a lot of oil wells in his district?  There must be some other reason....
939 2018-06-04 21:49:11 I was not being crude at all. Seriously wanted to know what oil was good for polishing. Honestly.
940 2018-06-04 21:49:06 Should have a shower and get ready for work but am watching Skyfall with tea tree oil and cotton wool shoved in me ear #noregrets x

Rub a small amount of coconut oil between your fingers to warm it up, then apply it to flyaways to smooth hair into place. Use it on the ends of your hair to control split ends.
945 2018-06-04 21:48:49 It's easy to cure cancer. Just approve RSO Rick Simpson Oil and give everybody a chance. Get rid of big pharmaceutical companies putting money in the everybody's pocket and taking our lives away from us with chemotherapy.. Approve RSO and start curing people.
946 2018-06-04 21:48:36 I always wondered why I waited 2,000 extra miles before getting the oil changed in my car... after waiting at NTB for the past hour and a half, I know exactly why I waited the extra 2,000 miles
947 2018-06-04 21:48:13 They are Oil buddies ain't they?
948 2018-06-04 21:48:08 Every couple of weeks a guy in a truck pulled up to a pipe in the yard and pumped oil into it so we could heat the place.
949 2018-06-04 21:48:07 Yes. Trump is isolating a country that can not be isolated because it uses Arab oil and China is a creditor of the Americans. A country whose economy disappears if the fear of the Russians ceases to exist. A madman rules a maddened country at an insane time.
950 2018-06-04 21:47:53 That’s thing with gas tax: you don’t really notice it very much as compared to the cost of oil, it isn’t much. Minnesota has the 5th largest road system in the country & winter, so maintaining that takes $. Most experts say MN is pretty efficient at it given # of roads & weather
951 2018-06-04 21:47:49 Who would of known an oil change for an electric car would take two hours
952 2018-06-04 21:47:47 Todays extreme cleaning episode is brought to you by arachnophobia: if I dust everything down and clean with eucalyptus oil THERE WONT BE EIGHT LEGGED DEMONS 
953 2018-06-04 21:47:43 Don't nothin do nothing for stretch marks. Put the snake oil away and come to terms with your marks.
954 2018-06-04 21:47:27 My sister in law buys it on Amazon. Emu oil is also supposed to do the same thing.
955 2018-06-04 21:47:25 was also just gonna ask what kinda oil!
956 2018-06-04 21:47:24 Paying dividends like stock certificates in Standard Oil signed by Rockefeller himself!

Centipedes with toe fungus!

958 2018-06-04 21:47:24 I meant every word, your art is fantastic, and your a hot guy... I love your black and white work maybe more than your oil paintings, if that's even possible because the oils are fantastic also!
959 2018-06-04 21:47:23 2. Having worked with Tullow oil in Norway before it closed its doors in 2017 after the oil crisis, i know they have very strict rules that governs them and if we get these laws, then we can use that to counter their actions. This is impunity and totally unacceptable
960 2018-06-04 21:47:19 Syria ,Libya, Iraq, barma ,kashmir, palestine people is dieing over there and who created the war us UK and Europe so who is terrorist who wants oil who is killing people fir oil

963 2018-06-04 21:47:00 According to the judge "My home is my castle" isn't a viable excuse for pouring boiling oil out of my upstairs window onto the Jehovah's witnesses below.
964 2018-06-04 21:46:55 Tried a new essential oil in the diffuser to sleep, had a nightmare that 3 murderers were chasing me.

970 2018-06-04 21:45:02 Buhari's foolish decision on militants is one of the things which exacerbated the revenue issues later 2015 and 2016. Oil price was low and production was also low. A double whammy. I wrote about it in my piece on how Buhari's admin led Nigeria into recession.
971 2018-06-04 21:44:56 Oil is a global market, price influenced by OPEC turning on an off supply. Not the UK govt. The pro Indy forecasts were always wildly optimistic to the point of misleading. And thats been proven by its subsequent collapse and is now climbing back from sub $50 to mid $70s.
972 2018-06-04 21:44:39 After 2019 election the director of oil company will definitely sell oil at petrol pump.
973 2018-06-04 21:44:36 What is your preferred choice of oil?

977 2018-06-04 21:44:03 We gotta invade Venezuela and cop their oil fields to get this shit back down to $1.20
978 2018-06-04 21:44:00 You CAN drill for water and irrigate using only manual (human/slave) labor. The Romans and Egyptians managed some incredible feats without oil. If you are stranded in the desert without water, I’d pay more than $3.50/gal for water. Oil wouldn’t help in this circumstance
979 2018-06-04 21:43:58 You are so full of shit. Environmental policies have not hurt oil production. The oil companies would be going out of their minds.
NATO controls prices in this world.
The president can influence oil prices with his actions.

983 2018-06-04 21:43:30 There should be no environmental protections at all either. Everything should be for profit just for THEIR profit. They’ve spent millions already with climate denying so oil would still reign. They stomp legalization that helps green energy.
984 2018-06-04 21:43:25 I'm 35, and just starting to notice little lines. I noticed that they are way more noticeable with makeup on, so my solution has been to abandon makeup. My grandmother was a stunner well into her 60s, and she swore by olive oil (as a nightly moisturizer).

994 2018-06-04 21:42:29 I  agree. I had shoulder surgery and looked like total shit for two+ months, didn’t feel too good either! Cut the woman some slack and let her heal!
995 2018-06-04 21:42:13 If you’re talking flakes then no. All except the EcoStyler are a wax formula. If you get the Eco then get the Argan Oil (Red lid) or Flaxseed ( Black Lid) both are Gel.
996 2018-06-04 21:42:10 I will ask my hubby tonight. He’s a molecular biologist at Purina. I know you can give fish oil capsules.
997 2018-06-04 21:42:05 Um, so the brain let me go play with oil paint today, but idiot that I am, i now have a fistful of faux sable and faux squirrel  brushes I have no idea how to clean.
998 2018-06-04 21:42:05 also know that there is a lot of bullshit in Weight Watchers rules. Like, bananas are technically 0 points unless they're blended. Same with chickpeas. Fruits are 0 points unless they're dried (or blended). Coconut oil has a disproportionate amount of points b/c of cholesterol
999 2018-06-04 21:41:51 Is olive oil a vegetable?

1006 2018-06-04 21:41:09 Now imagine what would happen to Permian producers if oil prices take a nosedive from now till Q3 2019! Shale production is so delicate it’s just not sustainable IMO
1007 2018-06-04 21:41:07 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1008 2018-06-04 21:41:03 Didn't Marie Helvin do an ad for cooking oil when she used it on her face - waaaaaaay back in the 80s?
1009 2018-06-04 21:41:03 [food]

So a fun thing with my #MCAS is my body hates both dairy and fermented foods (including vinegars!), which has made finding salad dressings a challenge

Really appreciate that my partner was ready with the lemon juice, olive oil, and salt combo 
1010 2018-06-04 21:40:57 Ever wonder why there is no extra-slutty olive oil?
1011 2018-06-04 21:40:40 Who forced the oil price down and why?commodities can have +/- prices. Oil revenues were caught up in a devious plot targeting ‘others’. Given the revenue contribution to Treasury, it heftily hurt ‘the UK’ and yes, affected projected figures adversely against Scotland’s future.
1012 2018-06-04 21:40:38 Makes sense, the input seems outrageous unless there’s an expectation that gas and oil on the market will double.

1018 2018-06-04 21:40:15 I saw someone paint a really dramatic sunrise and they accomplished a dramatic glow by using oil over gold leaf, I’m wondering if something similar could be done with one of them in water!
1019 2018-06-04 21:40:14 You just need to make your own. I can walk you through making butter and RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) at home if you want. I make some dank treats :) Hit me up.

1034 2018-06-04 21:38:44 I should drink more & more often. Sometimes I feel like my mouth is glued shut & like my blood or even the inner of my mouth really is oil or something along those viscosity..
1035 2018-06-04 21:38:33 The fact that coconut oil doesnt taste as good as it smells kills me every day
1036 2018-06-04 21:38:22 Oil and gas will soon be things of the past what are you guys going to do if it stop existing.
1037 2018-06-04 21:38:06 I thought we were going to try and drill our own oil

1040 2018-06-04 21:37:33 You were decieved. Putin controls only several towers of Kremlin. All Moscow also against him. And we don't produce oil. The oil came itself from underground. We draw it with buckets. It is true that we have no brain inside head but we can think by our asses. Zombie's priviledge.

1046 2018-06-04 21:37:15 Saying that Canada is selling you steel that could be a national security issue IS insulting considering the wars we have fought together.

1052 2018-06-04 21:36:11 Hemp, we should be growing more hemp. You can make fabric, paper, rope, use it as animal feed, it's got seeds, you can make oil. It must be pretty carbon neutral. As a plant it stabilised the soil, so prevents erosion. Why aren't we growing it?

1058 2018-06-04 21:34:55 Throw some oil at him. By oil I mean the type of oil they use in oil rigs, not cooking oil. Oil irritates bird skin and it'll put him or her in a lot of pain. Then grab it and then stick it in the closet and run. Wait for a few days until it becomes claustrophobic then let it out
1059 2018-06-04 21:34:50 I can sum up my life with the fact that I go to a different garage every time I need my oil changed so that when they tell me something is majorly wrong with my car, I can act super surprised, as if I didn’t already know lol

1106 2018-06-04 21:28:49 Useless nd totally fake dont use it.  Fake oil, nonthing help in hair growth
1107 2018-06-04 21:28:45 FWIW I found eucalyptus oil works great for sticker residue. It also makes your laptop smell lovely!
1108 2018-06-04 21:28:29 Ya sabi sih, minyak tuh oil kan?
1109 2018-06-04 21:28:28 Doesn’t your oil profits allow you to pay for things like education and healthcare without the need for a sales tax?
1110 2018-06-04 21:28:12 At least he’s consistent.  Selling snake oil to the desperate and uneducated.  Gonna be a special place in the afterlife for these evangelicals.
1111 2018-06-04 21:28:02 lama lama gua bawa oil control film jg ni. muka minyakan mulu kek ada yg goreng bawan
1112 2018-06-04 21:27:59 That's because @GasBuddyDan , you'd need to load this toxic flammable sludge into oil tankers to get it to any other country but the US at tremendous risk to people and the ocean. Why do that, when Alberta is just across the border from their longest and best customer?
1113 2018-06-04 21:27:12 I learned about the lesser quality of Albertan oil through a person who has worked in the gas industry, and explained how the pipeline would export to Asian markets which now need cleaner burning fuel due to air pollution, thus #KinderMorgan doesn't make economic sense. #cdnpoli
1114 2018-06-04 21:27:10 Someone please get Samira some oil that weave is dryyyyy #loveisland
1115 2018-06-04 21:27:02 My skin feels amazing. Coconut oil after showering is really working wonders.
1116 2018-06-04 21:26:54 Yeah, lots of brainwashed people too easily susceptible to snake oil salespeople spreading propaganda
Exhibit A: people who believed Obama wasn’t born in America
Exhibit B: people who believed PizzaGate
 
The evidence is pretty clear that people get hoodwinked
1117 2018-06-04 21:26:50 Convey to US and UK the question why they support Saudi Arabia and sell them weapons? Oil interests maybe?
1118 2018-06-04 21:26:37 Go to get an oil change for my client and the mechanic proceeds to just vent about his ex wife ..... Idk why I'm always the person people choose to dump their shit on but sheesh I'm not a therapist  happens.all.the.time.
1119 2018-06-04 21:26:34 There is literally nothing more attractive then seeing a woman changing her own tire. A woman changing her own oil comes in a close second. Your the best! Can’t wait to see you back on the ice!
1120 2018-06-04 21:26:20 I have a major craving for freshly baked italian bread. Hand made, not from breadmachine. Gotta be long, low, and open crumb. Whatever vegan butter brand on sale, olive oil with spices, fresh marinara left over from a heaping portion of ziti. Ungh must eat...
1121 2018-06-04 21:26:16 Subaru Rant--Reputation & Reliability are a JOKE!!! 7 year old car, less than 65K miles and Subaru can do nothing to help with a blown engine due to a known oil consumption issue. #DontBuySubaru #AntiSubaru #SubaruSucks
1122 2018-06-04 21:26:07 So you did use oil and not polish! I knew it.
1123 2018-06-04 21:26:04 Hahaha. Getting desperate hey? Good. Soon, very soon. Don’t fuck with us . We have more oil than u.
1124 2018-06-04 21:25:43 When we see an electric M1 Abrams Tank, that's when they should worry about the price of oil collapsing.  Luckily, no fear of peace breaking out any time soon... ;-)
1125 2018-06-04 21:25:38 Worked right through break today only to go straight to an oil change appointment without a book, so yes, it is the mondayest of Mondays.

1130 2018-06-04 21:25:18 @MyKawarthaCom Its stupid to invest in oil when it is being fazed out along with the fact the environment is showing it can't take any more of the waste and fallout !! (0_-)

1135 2018-06-04 21:24:46 Those sprouts look scrumptious! Also, olive oil, sea salt, and high heat in the oven crisps them up real good. Just like kale 
1136 2018-06-04 21:24:42 Snake oil salesman at work. pathetic.

1141 2018-06-04 21:23:54 I would think the main reason for gas prices are tied to oil price increases, that’s how it actually has always worked.

1146 2018-06-04 21:23:05 But I can't put eatables in my petrol tank and neither can burn them to cook my food. And I hope you know the crude oil prices have gone high since 2004. The world is recognising us as what? Country whose PM spells strength as streanh?

He told us his vehicle "smelled super bad like marijuana" and that he wanted to make sure we were done in time for him to pick up his girlfriend "from the tiddy bar".

Fucking lmao rn!
1152 2018-06-04 21:22:09 Oil worker here.. ("millennial"too) most of my coworkers are of my generation, most are surprisingly moderate (very few hardcore conservatives anymore, usually the old guys) but the Democratic party didn't want our vote. Still doesn't.. good luck with the hipsters and bloggers.

1164 2018-06-04 21:20:33 This report/tweet is incomplete no responsible long term oil forecast should come without #ClimateChange policy implications of said forecast.

1171 2018-06-04 21:20:12 To be fair to Mr Chavez, he slowly wrecked his oil industry by political interference and underinvestment. He didnt kill it off in one go to prove how woke he was.
1172 2018-06-04 21:20:07 There wasn’t a single oil filter wrench that would fit that thing at all to budge it.  I don’t blame all these oil change techs.

What I’m going to do. Buy steel oil drums, and use them to start fires during frost warnings. Just like in Burgundy France.
1178 2018-06-04 21:19:40 The oil crash
1179 2018-06-04 21:19:39 Oil closed today at $64. The price of gas started to climb when a barrel was $71. Why hasn't the price of gas gone down as well? Republican regime profiteers...

1189 2018-06-04 21:18:46 Too bad they didnt also insist that Clinton enact "tough standards" before Bill shipped 400,000 tons of fuel oil to NK. 

Would have been smart for them to have insisted on verification back then. But they didnt. 

Now, it just looks and smells like the usual partisan b.s.

Just going to keep waiting on these beat downs and continue to dollar cost average for now. Today was enough red to add imo.
1244 2018-06-04 21:12:49 Squeeze out Iranian oil by exporting Canadian oil in massive quantities world wide!
1245 2018-06-04 21:12:43 Argan*
Great finds. Remember to moisturize with water, then with a leave-in then add oil and if you want add butter... that order.
1246 2018-06-04 21:12:19 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$1.50 or 2.0% to US$75.29 a barrel. The US Nymex price fell by US$1.06 or 1.6% to US$64.75 a barrel.

1247 2018-06-04 21:11:56 Oh my god, is coffee like my brain's snake oil??? Only it does work for everything
1248 2018-06-04 21:11:53 How else would they get their oil lobbyist money?
1249 2018-06-04 21:11:22 I like how you say 'just 600B'. There is a high possibility the oil there, won't recoup such amount.
1250 2018-06-04 21:11:21 every time i choose butter over oil i imagine serving it to reynolds woodcock
1251 2018-06-04 21:11:19 Have enough guts to tell them that #NYSscandal and #70BKPCloot can all be used to build up a refinery in #Turkana instead of transporting crude oil to Mombasa! We are avoiding heavy truck on our roads to reduce highway petrol fires. @ObudoB
1252 2018-06-04 21:11:17 LOL it’s straight. Ima ride again eventually. Just need a less powerful bike.

Nothing major, just gotta fix the alignment and then change battery and oil/gas cause I haven’t started it in awhile
1253 2018-06-04 21:11:14 Like drilling  for oil.
1254 2018-06-04 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: burnt crust with stale motor oil and arugula.
1255 2018-06-04 21:10:49 I really like the smell of bio oil 
1256 2018-06-04 21:10:34 Good, but that still doesn't make you a Liberal.

You don't seem obsessed with the Maduro regime's inability to feed and clothe people despite $60/brrl oil.
1257 2018-06-04 21:10:29 I take one teaspoon of honey and one teaspoon of extra virgin coconut oil a day cx
1258 2018-06-04 21:10:20 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
1259 2018-06-04 21:10:19 Yeah, the Scottish population were told that North sea oil revenues at $110/barrel would underpin an investment in infrastructure that would make us the envy of the world. Oil price crash and negative revenue would have resulted. Total misinformation.

1261 2018-06-04 21:09:49 Maggie takes glucosamine and two fish oil tablets every day. Helps the coat, too.
1262 2018-06-04 21:09:43 I’ve been bragging for months about my car dealership doing free full details with every oil change. Turns out it’s actually $150 for a detail but they’ve been doing mine for free all this time bc my car is so dirty that they feel bad for me lol
1263 2018-06-04 21:09:34 I use wipes then on the 3rd wipe is put olive oil and then go to sleep

1266 2018-06-04 21:09:16 Did my 8 year old son really correct me on proper essential oil chakra placement? 

I showed him my crown chakra oil and told him I put it on the middle of my forehead.

He says “That’s your third eye mom not your crown!” 
1267 2018-06-04 21:09:15 i’ve had the best luck washing ours with a hard scraper, generous amount of warm water, sponge w/ no soap to get the detritus and dirty oil out, then dry it back out on the stove. wiped down w/ fresh oil using a corner of paper towel if the surface looks dull after all that
1268 2018-06-04 21:09:07 You use fish oil as fuel for your planes.
1269 2018-06-04 21:08:49 A lot of lettuce, oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Oh, and double toasted bread.
1270 2018-06-04 21:08:43 Na bado oil returns.

1272 2018-06-04 21:08:32 I'd love to debate her.
i do not deny the climate is changing.
i contend that Science worked hand in hand with big oil for 134 years
then turned around and blamed the working people. 
Carbon is a factor, yes!
but the Sun is the ultimate driver of the weird weather. 
@TamithaSkov
1273 2018-06-04 21:08:30 I do not agree with, but respect your decision to use fresh . I would have gone with spinach and some oil. :)
1274 2018-06-04 21:08:29 @TheFive Everyone is addicted to ridiculous questions like "Can Pres. Trump pardon himself?" and no one cares about how Hillary got away with the murder of Americans in Benghazi, the sale of American oil to Russia, and playing fast & loose with State secrets.
1275 2018-06-04 21:08:29 On oil & gas, the decision was:
* not @nzlabour policy - not in manifesto
* not Coalition policy - not in coalition agreement with @winstonpeters, and
* not NZ Government policy - no cabinet minute.
It was a whim announced by press statement by @jacindaardern.

1276 2018-06-04 21:08:26 You know just sitting here chillin waiting for my oil to be changed and my rainbow just breaks 
1277 2018-06-04 21:08:22 I don’t think anything Nic expressed about continuity wasn’t anything the Creative Team wasn’t already doing.

Ask Karn’s best friend Venser about the Glistening Oil, for instance.
1278 2018-06-04 21:08:19 you are right I forgot about carter (peanuts) and both bushes who were in oil. There may be others, it is just that the current one is such a disaster, I guess I shouldn't tar all business men with the same brush

1283 2018-06-04 21:07:45 it was really whale oil, but close enough
1284 2018-06-04 21:07:20 A white woman called the police on us because we cut her in line at the McDonald’s. 

What she didn’t know is that I rubbed oil to protect us from cops on the dashboard.
1285 2018-06-04 21:07:08 Nothing...go back to sleep.
1286 2018-06-04 21:06:52 @JaneRaybould @Clure4Congress @karaforcongress @Paul_Theobald_  Please review these numbers.  If killing our wild horses to satisfy ranchers & oil factions were not bad enough, it's apparent there's an astronomical cost to taxpayers.
1287 2018-06-04 21:06:43 it’s a felony to have thc oil in FL but people rape and kill people and walk free everyday. I truly hate this state sometimes
1288 2018-06-04 21:06:05 I really doubt that if the chinese maggots found a 'sizable' oil deposit

1298 2018-06-04 21:04:33 Just got tea tree oil in my paper cut and I wouldn’t recommend it 
1299 2018-06-04 21:04:27 A ban on furs would mean that Sami reindeer fur products would be illegal. Killing a trade and culture that has existed for centuries. In favour of polluting synthetics. That make oil companies richer. So simple? Over empathic?
1300 2018-06-04 21:04:17 Red oil jollof. That shii have been dope from day 1.
1301 2018-06-04 21:04:07 I met him. I shook his hand and when I touched his arm the guy is a fucking marble statue. He’s a beast. He’s going to be elite and when he figures it all out I hope he’s got an oil drop on his sweater.
1302 2018-06-04 21:04:07 Shoyu and sesame oil in the eggs baby
1303 2018-06-04 21:04:00 Putting a good amount of Coconut oil/Argan oil in your hair before you go swimming really helps, and doesnt strip treatment. It’s a nightmare honestly lol
1304 2018-06-04 21:03:50 Snake oil salesmen, largely rumbled of a time without ever really succumbing to lowly interest. Forever a potential customer whose imaginary recurring ailment can be soothed away with spoonfuls of liquid gibberish & the cunning promise of a concentrated solution. Mugfools of it
1305 2018-06-04 21:03:23 @SecretaryZinke save COAL . extraction oil from coal plant 41% more oil reserves for USA. 500 000 new jobs. process was perfected in WW11. no pollution in air or water from plant. free land ready for plant in Salyersville KY. next to new highway MT.

1306 2018-06-04 21:03:22 As a 30 year gasoline/oil retailer, be aware that the price increases are NOT based on Fake News about tariffs; It is a money-grab by big oil. It’s hard on YOU & retailers, too! Just curtail unnecessary driving. Starve Big Oil.
1307 2018-06-04 21:03:14 Which is right and proper.  I don't see Saudi Arabia giving free oil to Israel.
1308 2018-06-04 21:03:14 Summary of Day 1 at annual EIA conference. It's a great time to be in the oil business and US is going to produce a lot more oil and gas and sell it to China (and some others). Not one mention of climate change in 5-6 talks I attended today. Also, "coal is coming back in China!"

1314 2018-06-04 21:02:40 @TeamCavuto jet fuel is JP5. JP5 is diesel. Diesel costs less to make because it takes less processing to make. The price of diesel goes up because the refineries have to stop making gasoline to make it. It has nothing to do with the cost of a barrel of oil.

1351 2018-06-04 20:57:01 I love that it only cost me $40 for an oil change. Went to Jiffy Lube in WA and it cost me over $100.
1352 2018-06-04 20:56:56 Other than high prices on food because of high priced regular gas and diesel fuel. America needs to start using our own recourses and stop buying foreign oil. Fuel cost me a lot less than what it is now.
1353 2018-06-04 20:56:49 You should ban Oliver oil and lemon you use too much of it

1361 2018-06-04 20:56:03 Another lie from your snake oil salesman. Tarrifs cost money and people lose farms and businesses because of them. Destroying economy
1362 2018-06-04 20:55:58 Yes exactly. Brine or olive oil is best

1369 2018-06-04 20:54:56 You should look up asymmetrical warfare and understand that there are tens of millions of armed Americans spread across almost four million miles of US soil, much of which is the source of food, oil, and supplies our mighty military depends heavily on.
1370 2018-06-04 20:54:48 you don't need it. Jus plug into garage outlet. We never installed one. no need :)

1374 2018-06-04 20:54:30 interesting that Nat PR are trying to compare the lack of evidence for meth testing with Labour ending oil exploration, as if there isn’t a world of evidence about the effect of burning carbon on the planet
1375 2018-06-04 20:54:12 They’re planning to corner the energy market worldwide - he who controls energy; controls the world - this has always been about oil and nuclear energy

1379 2018-06-04 20:53:58 Nintendo has a potentially huge, incredibly deep competitive game on their hands with Mario Tennis Aces, but if they don't get its netcode issues sorted out before launch, it's all for naught. And since Nintendo and the Internet are like oil and water, the concern is real.
1380 2018-06-04 20:53:57 This is the biggest lie to #American_economy. It's all fake jobs created around fake #energy market. What if #oil_price drops to 20$ or boosting to 120$? In both senarios you will lost at least 5 million #jobs darling. You calling yourself a #businessman? Fragile!
1381 2018-06-04 20:53:51 But Lush claims itself as promoting openess. Yet they lied about palm oil in their products, 2 women have criticised Lush for misrepresenting their involvement with undercover police officers. Still, if you cannot see the hypocrisy of this, because it suits your agenda, carry on.
1382 2018-06-04 20:53:44 "In return for financial and foreign policy favors..." Nonsensical: Russia's most important export and source of wealth is its oil and natural gas.  The Trump admin has exponentially increased domestic production of both and it is hitting the Russian economy like a mace.

1440 2018-06-04 20:45:45 So, dude at Subaru said there was a software update for incorrect low oil level indications. That doesn’t explain why my car was down a quart last time, mr man. 
1441 2018-06-04 20:45:41 And my son just struck oil in my living room too!!!

1445 2018-06-04 20:45:16 Your mcm dosen’t have a skin care routine, u can smell the french fry oil coming from his pores when y’all kiss
1446 2018-06-04 20:44:47 Prices are rising because the price is determined by speculators and they are looking ahead to shortages due to a lack of productive well discovery for several years. There is plenty of oil today but the bet is there won't be in the future,.
1447 2018-06-04 20:44:40 just tried oil. I'm proud.
1448 2018-06-04 20:44:35 One thing I'm good at is subtly "as a flight attendant" explaining to obvious Republican men at bars/the beach etc. that with Trump having gas prices so high, these cheap airline prices will end when airline oil hedges made during Obama end, & to plan on not travelling next year.

1451 2018-06-04 20:43:44 Depends on if you eat it with butter or with oil. If you eat it with oil drizzled on it, you’re a millennial. If you eat it with butter spread on the toast under it, you’re old school. And if you eat it with neither? Well, then you’re doing it wrong.

1456 2018-06-04 20:43:23 Lol, the Venezuela boggie man.  So sadly predictable, sister.  I’m sure you are equally outraged about corporate special interests.  If I cared what someone as silly as you thought, I’d ask to see your ALL CAPS tweets sounding off about oil lobbyists.

1481 2018-06-04 20:41:03 Vinyl was thin in the 80s because the raw materials became expensive due to an oil shortage. So I'm told by a fellow collector anyway. I'm a fan of a nice vertigo swirl myself.

The news outlets such as #CNBC and #Reuters should have only reported the news of oil markets. Separating commentaries from news is a must. The readers deserve to know the facts not the opinions of pundits or big boys with undisclosed agenda.

1497 2018-06-04 20:38:29 Well so far since the tax reform -I've received a bonus and two raises and seen a decent increase in my take home pay.  All I see in CA are high taxes by Democrat leadership.  And Kern is not poor.  Oil and gas and agriculture we don't have homeless encampments that plague LA &SF
1498 2018-06-04 20:38:25 EIA clearly has gotten faster over the past 30 years - back when we had to wait two or three or four months for publications - but there's still a major lag in various data, such as oil production. But precision is always better with its monthly data versus its weekly estimates.

1513 2018-06-04 20:35:23 Synthetic oil is like $8-10 a quart.
1514 2018-06-04 20:35:21 Describe that knock, my grandfather's knock is like breaking coconut with your teeth, kpom! Shit hurts so much you'd think someone poured hot oil on your scalp
1515 2018-06-04 20:35:18 I’m obsessed with coconut oil
1516 2018-06-04 20:34:50 Olive oil? Organic? That's not comfort food. . .
1517 2018-06-04 20:34:48 Yes. Oil is essential. Coconut oil does wonders for me. Especially for waterproof mascara.
1518 2018-06-04 20:34:35 My friend @JamieVoiceOver reminded me of a board game called "Snake Oil" and it makes me miss playing that game with my buddies SO FREAKING MUCH! @TheRealSibsy @AndySteinMusic @Saxm13
1519 2018-06-04 20:34:32 vape oil. Please I must see
1520 2018-06-04 20:34:26 We get avocado oil at Costco.
1521 2018-06-04 20:34:26 If you have a diffuser (I think kmart sell them now for $25)  put some lavender oil drops in it. Seriously gives me way better sleep.
1522 2018-06-04 20:34:06 That’s v true, I was having a chat about hot vs. poker hot; my point with this is that they don’t actually think im gorgeous, they’re just trying to sell their snake oil
1523 2018-06-04 20:33:57 @JeffProbst Remember season 22 when Francesca was trying to start a fire with flint while sitting beside a burning oil lantern? Too funny. Let me play and I promise not to get voted out first! <3
1524 2018-06-04 20:33:55 Canola oil is loaded with trans fats
1525 2018-06-04 20:33:41 Because we expect that supply will tighten more in the coming weeks, we  feel that the oil price correction is close to being over. Even though  we may see a few more bad days, buy the breaks. We should see new highs  by the Fourth of July. Distillates are still very tight.

1528 2018-06-04 20:33:06 OPEC backed from a strong commitment to raise oil production but only  promised to work together and stressed the need for continued  cooperation between oil producers, as opposed to signaling an actual  number on an expected production increase.
1529 2018-06-04 20:32:43 Intresting because the meth decision wasn't a 'decree' like oil exploration and he was a cabinet minster who helped sign it off

1531 2018-06-04 20:32:34 Getting oil changed @ place that is telling customer ahead of me they don’t know how to close her hood.  She doesn’t seem to have ever had this problem before.  This does not inspire confidence...
1532 2018-06-04 20:32:09 The duty of micro gravity in an atom or molecule is to push heavier elements down and shift lighter elements up. exactly like our earth.heavier element like metal is in center.The good example glass with half water and oil.micro gravity push the lighter "OIL"up and the water down

It doesn't rain in winter. Unless! I get a rain totem. Those require truffle oil. Pigs can't find truffles in winter. Pls.
1536 2018-06-04 20:31:32 Bruhhh.... I hate when I come in for a oil change and they start telling me all this other shit wrong with the car. GIVE ME MY RECEIPT AND LET ME LEAVE.

1540 2018-06-04 20:30:06 You are turning an oil tanker not a speedboat. It’s strange how every other country in the world with Scotland’s resources or less manages it yet Scotland would be uniquely incapable. Makes you wonder what’s holding it back?
1541 2018-06-04 20:29:58 Sounds like someone forgot to oil his chaps.

1561 2018-06-04 20:26:31 You’re blaming other countries for what that stupid congress did 30 years ago they sold the country for oil
1562 2018-06-04 20:26:27 $USO
Oil prices slide near two-month lows as OPEC seen curbing output cuts
Crude oil futures fell today, with U.S. WTI settling near a two-month low, as investors continue to sell in the face of growing U.S. production, possible global supply growth and nagging trade tensions.
1563 2018-06-04 20:25:58 You should look up cholera in England in 1848. It caused 1000,s of deaths from England people shitting into their drinking water. Sounds like Montreal and Victoria and all of BC. A pipeline that might leak oil is a tragedy though?
1564 2018-06-04 20:25:57 lol I have a few deep conditioning treatments lol and like 3 bottles of oil and a tub of coconut oil hahahahahah this hair better be miraculous in 2 months hahahahahaha

1566 2018-06-04 20:25:21 how is it possible the latest a dealership is willing to do an oil change is 1pm
1567 2018-06-04 20:25:14 What cards are they holding?  Any?  Use to be oil, right?  and now.... Seems like he's letting them fight just to be nice.  Truely he could just smack them down with a back hand.

1570 2018-06-04 20:25:02 Came for an oil change and ended up having my airbags replaced  I still have another hour on my wait.
1571 2018-06-04 20:24:59 You feel me?!! We are a landlocked country which means the oil industry isn’t enough for us to strive as a nation do to not having abundant oil to buyers, which other countries will step in soon enough with how we are doing as a failed state..they get the lands and the oil.

1574 2018-06-04 20:24:36 Matte liquid lips other than the Lancôme matte shakers, gimmicky face masks and serums that prob don’t do anything, anything with coconut oil bc I prefer to NOT have my pores clogged, products that are essentially tinted vaseline, luxury mascara bc maybelline exists lmao

1577 2018-06-04 20:24:02 The countries guilty of creating these fake proxy wars should be held accountable and take these refugees in. It’s alright Trump and his anti Muslim rhetoric when the joke is his country are behind destabilising the Middle East, all because they want to steal it’s oil and gas.
1578 2018-06-04 20:23:53 Small blessings...just got my oil changed for free

1582 2018-06-04 20:23:17 Is the decision to not offer more off shore oil and gas exploration permits the sort of decision that should be made at cabinet level, or minister level?

1600 2018-06-04 20:21:26 Too bad the brilliant leaders in the Dem party were not so proactive during the Clinton presidency, when #Clinton sent 400,000 tons of fuel oil to North Korea w/o putting in place enforceable and actionable verification requirements.

1618 2018-06-04 20:19:08 Thanks! I wash it with @SheaMoisture kids carrot and mango shampoo, comb it with the shampoo in. Rinse, finish with their kids curling buttercream and dry with diffuser. Sometimes add biosilk or Moroccan oil for shine.
1619 2018-06-04 20:18:54 Did Greenpeace + @jacindaardern PR Team set up the Parliament Steps acceptance of the petition to ban Oil and Gas so Miss Ardern could have her UN moment? IMO yes !

1621 2018-06-04 20:18:46 Olive oil....just kidding, blue cheese followed by feta (I love salt).
1622 2018-06-04 20:18:35 Something new and different, eh?
1623 2018-06-04 20:18:24 We cannot continue to produce and consume this way if we want to avoid ecological destruction. The amount of energy and pollution will continue even if most of is renewable. There still needs to be oil extraction to make all these new renewable energies
1624 2018-06-04 20:18:21 DO IT just dont do it like i did it omg ALSO coat ur entire head in coconut oil like 30 mins before u bleach it then just put the bleach right on top it still works . N for toner use wella u have to mix it urself but its really good
1625 2018-06-04 20:18:20 Too bad we don't have money for schools, hospitals, doctors and nurses. Luckily we have money to give to big oil!
1626 2018-06-04 20:18:18 I chopped it up into florets (well about 1/3 of the cauliflower, I got a big one!) and tossed it with some olive oil (not too much or else it gets greasy!), cumin, paprika, garlic, and ground black pepper. Spread on a baking sheet/roasting tray at 220c for about 20 minutes!
1627 2018-06-04 20:18:16 It's different this time since most of our oil is domestic nowadays. Great chart though love the clarity of it.
1628 2018-06-04 20:18:07 Lol that made me laugh !! Well soon maybe lol it's going .i got my oil changed 4,000 miles over due .how are you doing ?

1630 2018-06-04 20:18:05 Then, after the oil industry came down because the maintenance money was also going to someone pocket, they moved to narcotraffic.. law makers, law enforecements are biased to the "goverment" and when we took the street to demand a change, we were killed by them, no responsibles
1631 2018-06-04 20:18:03 Man coconut oil be melting in any type of warm weather. It could be 65 degrees that shit still melt
1632 2018-06-04 20:17:55 I mean it, it's gorgeous *___*

Can I ask - what program and brushes do you use? I really adore the oil-pastel-esque feel to the colours and would love to try it out :)
1633 2018-06-04 20:17:53 Or, do what Norway did and made an investment bank where all oil royalties went and which only the dividend could be spent.. Norway’s trillion dollar fund now provides an 80B dollar annual dividend. Instead Alberta blew all its cash on tax breaks

We got every herb, spice, seasoning, sauce, dips, dressing, condiment, oil, marinade and just endless possibilities of ways to combine them to create delicious flavors without involving killed animals.

1635 2018-06-04 20:17:24 I agree , but there are unique techniques that can be employed to maximize your needs.  Does everybody know how to make infused oil without it tasting heavily like cannabis,for more delicate dishes?  There's a lot to learn from *proper * cannabis cooks like @jeffthe420chef
1636 2018-06-04 20:17:24 Everything true but disappointed in gas prices. Who cares that America is # 1 exporter of oil with prices like this. Makes no sense. Hurts the little guy.

• drain the olive oil into an amber glass

1649 2018-06-04 20:16:49 I overuse the word “cancer” a lot, but these sponsored propaganda tweets paid by oil companies are truly cancer.
1650 2018-06-04 20:16:48 When it's travel season, gas goes up. When it's winter, gas goes down. We produce most of our oil domestically so our economic state is a pretty small factor. 
I'll guess your HC is private. Congrats the cost went down for you. Because 32 million people were removed by trump
1651 2018-06-04 20:16:40 but why ......I know there is a plastic oil drain plug .....isn't there still sediment in the bottom of the pan?

Me in Mississippi, June 4th: I have taken up permanent residence at the pool, where I can be seen baking in the sun covered in oil
1654 2018-06-04 20:16:21 It baffles me that people are so fooled by Trump. They're smart enough to know that our government shouldn't be fully trusted, but then turn around and trust a snake oil salesman. Why?

1656 2018-06-04 20:16:12 Come to think of, Gambians have an issue with Jarra. How comes there's NONE from Jarra in your Cabinet, Janneh Commission, Constitutional Review Commission when we're the most upright in that country? 

Wait until we start drilling the Samo Oil dorong.

1658 2018-06-04 20:15:33 Last month I took my car to a Jiffy Lube and they couldn't figure out how to fix the brake light, telling me I needed the wiring repaired by a mechanic. Took it to Meineke today for an oil change and they had it fixed in minutes. Solution? Using the correct fucking lightbulb.
1659 2018-06-04 20:15:29 Check your Transmission oil this morning.

1661 2018-06-04 20:15:20 That’s the answer I’m looking for whenever someone asks“what products do U use?”
They can’t understand that genes play a major role on how good your hair is!
I stay days without using a single oil on my hair though it remains thick and glowing cause it’s genes!What mama gave me
1662 2018-06-04 20:15:15 Well I guess we shall have to export the man with ”his” oil, because he isn’t letting any drop of it go unseen. Its like a child he bore.
1663 2018-06-04 20:14:56 @veebabyy__ made me get out of the car on the side of the freeway to check the oil and the water as if I knew what the fuck I was doing 
1664 2018-06-04 20:14:49 I agree, I think 10-year rate is in a rising wedge and should break lower, decline in oil and futures spec positioning support lower rates.
1665 2018-06-04 20:14:22 Also rescue remedy (the sweets are great for the cabin pressure changes on your ears too) and grapefruit essential oil
1666 2018-06-04 20:14:21 He does need to, and any of his ilk that think that privatisation is a good idea need to follow suit. They are doing nothing but selling snake oil in the cover of an efficient and necessary service and for that they should also be punished. They have taken from us and not given.
1667 2018-06-04 20:14:13 Olive oil? What ist for?

1670 2018-06-04 20:14:07 So my husband @stromie could tell you more; he made it! The basics: caramelized onions with miso paste, roasted asparagus in the oven, vegan aioli (made with olive oil and aqua faba which is chickpea cooking juice or juice from a can of garbanzo beans), & whole grain local bread!

1685 2018-06-04 20:12:11 True. That and then some, oil between the two lands caused tensions as well, but all in all neither have really benefited from the division, more foreigner allies were for the separation than the Sudanese civilians. The Separation is a cause for the huge set back in Sudan.
1686 2018-06-04 20:12:07 We are tired about your fake climate change ,which was clearly designed to limit our coal ,steel and oil production .which by the way ,eu ,Canada,  Russia, Iran . All do same thing ,but U.S. Can't . We beat you in kyoto and we pulled out of that .

1689 2018-06-04 20:11:54 Bravo! Full page advert saying NO to drilling in the gulf. We do NOT need another B.P style oil leak. No way. No how.
1690 2018-06-04 20:11:38 Very disappointed to find out my favourite @JordansCereals contains 'sustainable palm oil'. Ever since watching #Beforetheflood I just can't ingnore consuming a product that is so destructive when harvested. Please find an alternative!

1698 2018-06-04 20:10:45 >#3 on that, but 2.7%
I know TX and AK missed this diss. Ran out of room to do it proper.
Alaska and Texas pimp themselves huge on their oil extraction. It's a huge part of their economies. Then following right along at #3 is CA. big in that too, but at only 2.7% of our economy.

1700 2018-06-04 20:10:19 It's hard to say both Boycott Oil and Palm Oil. Something somewhere has to bend.
1701 2018-06-04 20:10:15 And knowing California, there is probably a law against capturing and storing rainwater that falls on your roof.

1705 2018-06-04 20:09:56 serious question, wouldn't cannabis oil numb your vagina? I have heard of people ingesting cocaine through other orifices  but it also numbs them. I would assume cannabis would as well.... which kind of defeats the purpose
1706 2018-06-04 20:09:48 Stubbs: You sillies, you didn't need to bail out Kinder Morgan, you just needed to enforce the Constitution! Why are you giving money to millionaires when families need help?

1707 2018-06-04 20:09:46 Confidence is putting on coconut oil instead of sunscreen when doing some gardening
1708 2018-06-04 20:09:43 Ravioli sounds good! Try just a garlic sautéed in olive oil and brush it on the bread without the garlic. Gets the aroma without over powering!
1709 2018-06-04 20:09:36 Jeffy, poor pathetic fool. Oil is a natural by product of this earth. It’s been seeping into our oceans for millions of yrs. That volcano put more  pollution in our atmosphere than all the cars in the US over 10 yrs
1710 2018-06-04 20:09:32 Thought putting coconut oil on my dog would relieve the itching. Nope, he loves coconut oils so it’s made the licking and itching worse. Any suggestions?

1712 2018-06-04 20:09:17 It’s like solidified palm oil
1713 2018-06-04 20:09:16 Maybe China is buying more oil, both their and other economies are, improving, and there are some trade restrictions on Iranian oil to the global market.

1715 2018-06-04 20:09:06 There's an easy answer to this issue, one Alberta industry generally supports: the Carbon Competitiveness Incentives designed to lower carbon-intensity of oil sands crudes. Much smarter strategy than abandoning ghg emissions standards. @andrew_leach

1741 2018-06-04 20:05:47 I'm Canadian, I remember when our $ was on par with yours, the goods we got from the US, STILL cost more because of the added tax we put on your goods. That being said, we sell you oil at a discounted price and you in turn sell your oil at the market price, making bigger profits.

1745 2018-06-04 20:05:32 You need to counter it with another base oil. Try a vegetable oil.

1752 2018-06-04 20:05:12 It’s locked in my unit and I can’t get the key until the morning. Sale auction ends tonight. In laws adamant they never added oil to fuel or engine. They’re of advancing yrs but do recall premix on the engine they owned before.

1754 2018-06-04 20:05:04 Nothing to improve BCs failed electric vehicle incentive program however. Want to reduce our dependence on oil and meet our climate change targets? Then you need to do something to increase EV sales above the current 1%
1755 2018-06-04 20:04:59 It do look like I put oil on to take that picture tho. My friends was like why ya titties look like fresh hot glazed krispy kreme donuts. I was weak

1758 2018-06-04 20:04:46 Neat coconut oil or shea butter are both fab if you can't be bothered to make a blend. I just use a towel after if they leave too much of a shine. #EthicalHour

1772 2018-06-04 20:03:38 Awesome to find out my car is burning oil at a ridiculous pace and the cost to fix it is $3,000.

1777 2018-06-04 20:02:43 I see that you can sub 1:1 but every source is a pro coconut oil one. Aka showing how to put it in. It just annoys me. Coconut oil isn't as awesome as it's portrayed to be.

1779 2018-06-04 20:02:41 It makes no economic sense to transport crude oil by truck a distance of more than 2000km and incur vessel freight to the destination port. The Jubilee leadership is aware  that they are fetching " water in sacks".

1783 2018-06-04 20:02:29 I remember Todd Mclellan’s response when questioned about what he thought about different choices at the 2015draft”stay the heck out of the way!”For me I’m hoping the guys making the decisions are smarter than us&it works out for the Oil in the end.
1784 2018-06-04 20:01:45 Not true because that accounting doesn’t include the impact on wildlife  post-life, it only accounts for carbon emissions & #climatechange - it also doesn’t account for the huge subsides for oil production which makes plastic cheaper than it really is

1785 2018-06-04 20:01:44 You ain’t got no oil of oregano?? Can’t relate
1786 2018-06-04 20:01:43 Oh man. Snake Oil could get all manner of silly.

1788 2018-06-04 20:01:32 Jess, totally OT here - but the cat that's licking and barbering, it could be due to food or environmental allergies, as well. If it is truly from anxiety, try her on CBD oil. Use the hemp variety. Would help ur old dog, too.
1789 2018-06-04 20:01:29 Too much oil, plus it's not a steak. It's umbengo njee nyana. 
1790 2018-06-04 20:01:21 Does flax seed oil have the same anti-inflammatory effects?
1791 2018-06-04 20:01:19 The only time America cares about "freedom" is if it involves oil in other countries. Has America liberated any slaves in Saidi Arabia? Forced migrant labourers there?

1794 2018-06-04 20:01:04 i have a question for all the #oott if i can get any help for something im wriiting on US oil exports. What could be an estimate of the rate of utilisation of pipelines from cushing to the gulf coast now? if i can get help on this i will be highly appreciated.
1795 2018-06-04 20:01:00 Whether it's beer, vinegar, apple juice, or olive oil, choosing unfiltered will generally get you an added assortment of subtle flavors.

1797 2018-06-04 20:00:55 I went outside to help a customer at the ATM and it's so hot that I can smell motor oil. Not even exaggerating. 

Miami might be pre-Hell....
1798 2018-06-04 20:00:50 Should I be more direct when dissing Iowa? I think they missed it when I said, "we're almost #1 in Ag too here in CA. like Iowa, where that's like their biggest industry! But that's like 3% of our economy, followed closely by oil. #3 on that, but 2.7%." 
They might have missed it
1799 2018-06-04 20:00:46 @VassyKapelos Governor Isley from Washington state has promised if Notley cuts off oil and gas to BC he will see BC is supplied.  If there is a spill in the Salish sea his coastline will be polluted too.
1800 2018-06-04 20:00:46 Made an appt for an oil change/tire rotation. Rolled in already cranky about how much it could potentially cost. Apparently 2 of each are included with my lease. This pleases me.
1801 2018-06-04 20:00:41 Ughhh i really went through this lol i tried everything. I couldn’t take it anymore so i took a tiny spoon of castor oil and i went into labor that same night

1812 2018-06-04 19:59:10 We work hard to avoid the deadly "Hardening of the Attitudes," which is common with aging.
Tech can be irksome, but:
Imagine: architects when cement was invented
oil painters -> acrylics
coachworkers -> fiberglas
draftsmen -> CAD
The old is known, the new -> potential wonders.
1813 2018-06-04 19:59:09 To all the girls with lash extensions. Don’t spray sunscreen or anything with an oil in it directly on your face, the lashes will come off and you will look pitiful like me rn :)
1814 2018-06-04 19:58:51 Whooo Oh what more refineing then oil based gasoline ? Please explain
1815 2018-06-04 19:58:43 Qu; House Martins arrived on Wed30th May Barnard Castle, building nests out of oil soaked gravel, will this affect the eggs,chicks,fledgelings #springwatch
1816 2018-06-04 19:58:42 Did the oilspill cover everything? Oil is spilled because you buy oil. We've always had hurricanes. But again I say, get off of your greenhouse gas producing computer if you think the planet is in danger. Anything that is happening to the planet, you are one of the perpetrators.
1817 2018-06-04 19:58:39 @iffahs_ salam kak pah, boleh ke nak cuci muka with cleasing oil lebih dari sekali untuk satu hari lepastu pakai cleasing cloth jugak. Macam saya student kelas pg pkai make up pastu cleasing oil + cloth pastu tnghari pkai make up balik pastu cuci dgn oil jugak. Boleh ke?

1822 2018-06-04 19:57:48 Unfortunately, GOP leadership has been hard at work advancing Trump’s Dirty Energy Agenda, which yields huge payoffs to the oil and gas industry. Americans deserve polices that will protect our planet, keep loved ones healthy, and preserve access to clean air, water, & land.
1823 2018-06-04 19:57:42 Bleach totally fries hair.  So, you may have to get it trimmed & buy (also) a light hair oil (from your salon) & put that in, too.  It is a stay-in light oil.  Repairs & should stop breakage.  
Also, never wash your hair every day or use irons on it every day, if you're bleached!
1824 2018-06-04 19:57:39 We do business with MANY Countries that we don't agree with. We import oil from Countries like Iran. This is no different. And "gladly risking their lives" doesn't make it a good decision. 
Ask their families.
1825 2018-06-04 19:57:38 Finally set Triniti a beauty shop hair appointment for this week to get her hair washed, combed out, oil moisturized and braided up into a curly Mohawk 
1826 2018-06-04 19:57:37 Get that oil hot! Small fillets, but amazing taste!
1827 2018-06-04 19:57:35 facts:
angola is becoming a middle income country with the help of chinese investment.
the communist nepalese govt announced a plan to become a middle income country in 5 years with the help of chinese investment.
venezuela is staying afloat partly because china's buying its oil.
1828 2018-06-04 19:57:30 Are you really this far gone to ignore the literal lobbying of these capitalists to keep oil, coal, and wood production going even though we have the technology right now to start moving over to renewable energy. But simply switching over won’t solve the ecological Croat
1829 2018-06-04 19:57:29 that one cel of oil can harry

1833 2018-06-04 19:56:42 You'll struggle to walk in and get a frelling oil change round here.

1836 2018-06-04 19:56:33 Well said. I love Jews, Israel but hate lobbies. Saudi Salafis ( they hate Shia Iran/Syria), CIA and Israeli lobbies for oil, to check Iran, golan heights security, trained the most dangerous Jihadis against secular Syria - Result IS. Meanwhile Saudi Salafi ideology is stronger.

1842 2018-06-04 19:55:38 Thank you very much your Excellency for this Innovative Hub. I believe Edo youths would see this as an avenue to learn, interact and create a network to share ideas to improve ICT in government, agricultural, medical, tax, payrolls, economy, markets, trade/stocks, oil, etc.
1843 2018-06-04 19:55:30 Finally getting an oil change even tho I don’t want too
1844 2018-06-04 19:55:29 At least the oil price might be going higher in MXN terms
1845 2018-06-04 19:55:24 Idk if you ever heard or read about Chinese restaurants using gutter oil to cook their food. It’s sickening and yet I still eat that chewy chicken 
1846 2018-06-04 19:55:11 Whether it's beer, vinegar, apple juice, or olive oil, choosing unfiltered will generally get you an added assortment of subtle flavors.
1847 2018-06-04 19:54:57 My brother is currently complaining that his caravan lacks the utensils to make pesto. The shelves in the kitchen won’t fit the taller Waitrose olive oil bottles either. An outrage.
1848 2018-06-04 19:54:54 I just spilled vegetable oil all over my kitchen 
1849 2018-06-04 19:54:53 was so excited to start vaping my medicinals via oil til it started giving me a rash smh

1854 2018-06-04 19:54:41 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1855 2018-06-04 19:54:23 CBD Oil has actually really helped me a lot 
1856 2018-06-04 19:54:18 I was dead ass DREADING coming to get my oil changed & my car is already in the shop. I thought I was gonna be here for hours. It’s a good Monday

1862 2018-06-04 19:53:12 Sure is "beautiful".

Can feel very mechanical: take tablets to sleep; something else for pain and joints; turmeric and cod liver oil for wellbeing; take medicines for mental illness; eat and stay hydrated.
1863 2018-06-04 19:53:04 I would rather see my sister working in a whore house than to believe this snake oil salesman.
1864 2018-06-04 19:52:57 Jeffy, you’re back to rambling. Jeez, pay attention. How on earth did you ever get a home painted, our house painters were great and very respectful. What say you? You know I need to spend all that oil and gas money. Love Scott Pruitt! Thank you Chesapeake Oil...
1865 2018-06-04 19:52:53 Thieves oil smells so good I die
1866 2018-06-04 19:52:47 Someone’s hormonal this evening, maybe try some primrose oil I’ve heard it helps.
1867 2018-06-04 19:52:46 No!No! We got oil. No more loans. Trust me
1868 2018-06-04 19:52:42 Go buy some oil stocks. Then you’ll be smiling every time you fill up. Instead of looking at how much your spending on gas you’ll be looking at your dividends checks your receiving.
1869 2018-06-04 19:52:34 Cullen: I can't believe you paid for a 65 year-old pipeline! Table the deal so Canadians can see how badly we got ripped off!

1874 2018-06-04 19:51:44 While I am a strong supporter of gay rights, I do see a difference between not creating a custom cake, or an oil painting and allowing anyone to sit in your restaurant and order off the menu. As an artist I am allowed to turn down work I find distasteful.
1875 2018-06-04 19:51:36 Today, while studying and waiting for an oil change(something that is long overdue) I wondered how Dean Winchester has time to do oil changes(I assume he does them himself) with all those pesky monsters chasing him?
1876 2018-06-04 19:51:28 LOOP can do 1 VLCC easily or even 2.. The VLCC traffic is low in LOOP. The issue is to get the Permian oil to LOOP.
1877 2018-06-04 19:51:25 I need a oil change
1878 2018-06-04 19:51:22 For $69, we'll change your oil and filter, check the air in your tires,  check your front and rear brakes, and check your coolant level, too.

1880 2018-06-04 19:51:15 And now, to QP. Kenney starts off asking about market access for Alberta oil under Indigenous leadership. Hoffman: We're interested in this project and energy minister has been looking at it #ableg
1881 2018-06-04 19:50:53 Literally have to let coconut oil  sit on my face bc I’m so fried lol
1882 2018-06-04 19:50:44 in other news, my engine oil is low and naturally there's no fucking oil in the car
1883 2018-06-04 19:50:26 At one end there is a mouthpiece, below is a small wick wrapped and soaked with the oil blend. Below that is the heating element, then battery, then led light that is triggered by the heating element. 2/2
1884 2018-06-04 19:50:17 Getting my car checked out after work, hoping it's not too serious but been worried I've started smelling more of an oil or gas smell while driving.
1885 2018-06-04 19:50:12 Even funnier will be what happens if it is determined that he is our first illegitimate POTUS.

1886 2018-06-04 19:49:19 well after $280 I have two new tires and and an oil change. Huzzah I can drive my car again
1887 2018-06-04 19:49:07 we have the elektra it's fancy, hot n cold and aromatherapy oil dispenser. I'm confused about what settings to run it on, how long.

1893 2018-06-04 19:48:34 Not been a great few days, tbh. Car failed its MOT with a large repair bill; the garage then caused an oil leak and don't know how to fix it! Now mum's front door handle has broken, and her place received a huge gas bill. Roll on Friday!
1894 2018-06-04 19:48:32 I changed the oil in a clown car today and was severely dissapointed when i opened the door and didnt see like 20 clowns piled in it
1895 2018-06-04 19:48:27 Why not drink exogenous ketones with mct oil instead?
1896 2018-06-04 19:48:10 Soooooo,  for those who don't know. 

You can rub vegetable oil on your hands before cutting pepper. That way,  your hands won't have the taste on it when you're done. Also,  you can rub it if you want to get rid of the pepper taste/burn on your hands. 

You're welcome.

1916 2018-06-04 19:44:56 Right but Dealing with the oil field you have to consider your health of your body as well as the income

1929 2018-06-04 19:43:37 SCRIPTURE OF THE DAY...And Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee? Tell me what hast thou in the house?

1931 2018-06-04 19:43:19 The car next to me smells like the driver bathed in a tub of patchouli, cleaned the interior with patchouli, drove through a carwash of 100% pure patchouli oil, has a leaking 50 gallon container in the trunk, and is growing it in the back seat

The windows are up

1938 2018-06-04 19:42:39 No there isn't. Can you see Mick And Fred at Border Force arguing  over the 'nose' of olive oil whether from Spain or Morocco (different soil apparently). It is purely paperwork at the border no spot checks.
1939 2018-06-04 19:42:31 Hi there. A painting of that size needs space, and room to stand back and take a retrospective look at it. If you were to consider it, I’d price it on complexity and time to complete. Also importantly, the cost of base material ie, a board, canvas etc. I’d use oil myself.
1940 2018-06-04 19:42:26 Has to have an airing.  don’t baby oil work? Or just put moisturiser straight in it.
1941 2018-06-04 19:42:23 I know it's officially summer because my coconut oil isn't solid anymore
1942 2018-06-04 19:42:17 Defo sold myself a dream lool a co-wash and oil treatment will have to do

1945 2018-06-04 19:41:42 My parents started sending me to 2 sessions of camp, because my mother was a could not keep her sanity with my many antics.

1948 2018-06-04 19:41:30 Do you have a suggestion as to how oil should be transported? Like it or not oil is intricately woven into the fabric of life including some of the clothes you are wearing, shoes and even the hair products you use.

1956 2018-06-04 19:40:39 What have you done to our favorite chips?!?!  Not our favorite anymore!  Completely different taste. I'm assuming you've changed your cooking oil. Whatever you did...BIG MISTAKE!
1957 2018-06-04 19:40:37 You can use whatever dressing you like, sometimes I make a vinegarette or Italian, sometimes I use the Skinny Girl sugar free dressings, sometimes I'll just do a little olive oil and lime/ chili powder. Again, Depends on what I have in the house or what my mood is

1960 2018-06-04 19:40:00 Wilde certainly has some untapped upside. Oil Knight really likes him. Just not sure Smith is anything more than 2nd pair at the NHL level and it’s crowded at LD here at that level. I think they should stay and take BPA at 10. They like Smith or Wilde more, then move down.

1964 2018-06-04 19:39:31 Economy is amazing but gas prices are rising because of what has happened /is happening in Libya, Syria and Iran and the Russian and Saudi threat of flooding the markets with more oil and the US inventory better than it should be to keep the prices in check.

1971 2018-06-04 19:38:34 Do you think the Bushes have anything to do with it? They’re the big oil folks and they hate President Trump.

1973 2018-06-04 19:38:23 Is it just me or did we get to the point where we see/hear the phrase "have you tried CBD oil?" really, really fast?
1974 2018-06-04 19:38:22 Good morning to the tuxedo mask chat noir are the best part about getting my oil changed?

 Sarah is stuck in "lie mode" again... :(
1981 2018-06-04 19:37:34 Obama was a dumbass who couldn’t fix an economy even after EIGHT years. He wasn’t responsible for crude oil prices going up over $100 a barrel, or maybe he was, because of his shitty economy.

2008 2018-06-04 19:34:11 yep -- Germany was able to offset DD weakness from 00 to 07 with a massive export boom.  current account moved into a 6% of GDP surplus even with high oil and gas and has stayed high since

2011 2018-06-04 19:33:49 Rise is gasoline prices easily explained.
#1 - Switch to the summer blend increases price.
#2 - State taxes raised in numerous States. The amount far exceeds oil company profits.
#3 - Iran was pumping at max to finance their nuclear ambition, terrorist & territorial expansionism.

2024 2018-06-04 19:31:53 im cheering for saudi arabia because i love oil
2025 2018-06-04 19:31:48 Gas prices are controlled by the elites who have invested in oil commodities, futures. They see a booming economy and Americans having more money to spend as an opportunity to charge more thus increasing their profits.That's it, they control the supply and output.

2030 2018-06-04 19:31:26 It is wrong for an organisation like @NNPCgroup that is already enmeshed in corruption to be the one managing our subsidy when we do not even know how much crude oil the country is producing.

2039 2018-06-04 19:30:08 Ned, if you bought a Ferrari, you wouldn't use low-end gas, generic oil, or dollar store wax. Same principle with Indy (although she may be more $$$).
2040 2018-06-04 19:30:00 Agree with this 100%. The peer pressure is real, but is isn’t an excuse. Change needs to be societal, but how the fuck do you turn round that oil tanker amongst so much noise?

2200 2018-06-04 19:14:02 I’m in a waiting room at an oil change place where some guy absolutely annihilated the toilet.
2201 2018-06-04 19:14:00 I got an engine flush and an oil change today and my car is running so smooth. Might take a drive..
2202 2018-06-04 19:13:59 This girl needs a canister vacuum cleaner and peppermint oil. 
2203 2018-06-04 19:13:59 I swished coconut oil around in my mouth while I showered (its called “oil pulling”) before spitting it back out and brushing my teeth. Just to try it. Boy oh boy does my mouth feel clean. 10/10 would definitely recommend!
2204 2018-06-04 19:13:50 Coconut oil from Walmart in the cooking section, it will help 
2205 2018-06-04 19:13:45 Honestly didn’t think it would take 2 hours to get an damn oil change 
2206 2018-06-04 19:13:42 Oh no! I think different hair grows at different lengths! Be patient babe  my hairs just always been like that! Even when I trimmed it, it was back within two weeks. I do weekly overnight coconut oil and olive oil hair masks if that helps? Both virgin & organic

2208 2018-06-04 19:13:35 How many kenyans has this oil manenos employed? Just curious...so that we are on the same page?
2209 2018-06-04 19:13:21 Ravishing red heads rolling around in oil in that gorgeous setting?! Boom baby, BOOM!  You May have guessed that I like that photo...
2210 2018-06-04 19:13:17 My question is why would you want to be critical of conservatives?  They support our Constitution, our flag, our President.  They support MAGA for everyone.  They are pro-life, and Christian.

Your selling snake oil as far as I am concerned Sasha the liberal.

2214 2018-06-04 19:13:02 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2215 2018-06-04 19:13:01 Take a short position in crude oil futures using rehypothecation to micro-hedge an exhaustion gap.
2216 2018-06-04 19:12:53 Y la clave es que era un impuesto que pagaba el cliente y Oil se lo retenía para depositar en el Estado. Pasa igual con las retenciones de ganancias y los aportes de los empleados
2217 2018-06-04 19:12:47 It’s a 2002 engine. Selling for FIL. He can’t remember adding oil anywhere. He last used it in 2009
2218 2018-06-04 19:12:40 My daughter bleaches out.  She does coconut oil treatments.
2219 2018-06-04 19:12:30 Wanna bet there'll be an oil scandal before the year is up.
2220 2018-06-04 19:12:18 i m starting nikki on a coconut oil regimen for her paws, check out her lifestyle channel and book “Self Care As You Enter Your Late Single Digits” dropping next month
2221 2018-06-04 19:12:18 Treasury Board is wrong. Any oil in any pipeline would come from somewhere. So the pipeline transport of it has ZERO impact on emissions from either end. @jkenney & his @Alberta_UCP caucus are correct. You are supporting Carbon leakage which you warned against.

2224 2018-06-04 19:11:49 better than boiling oil at least, you should try
2225 2018-06-04 19:11:28 Nothing has been significantly reduced, they simply move more oil total.  Show me any data that says otherwise.
2226 2018-06-04 19:11:10 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2227 2018-06-04 19:11:10 I'm not do this is still really good, ramen-y type of flour, palm oil, and onion pancakes often made with spicy korean chili
2228 2018-06-04 19:11:03 Is this the deal?
The White House pretends climate change doesn’t exist because Russia has vast oil reserves in the Arctic and if we start adapting to climate change by developing alternate sources of energy, Putin and his cronies stand to lose.
2229 2018-06-04 19:11:00 Dumb! But them big oil overcharges for all their products so working slaves pay!
2230 2018-06-04 19:10:39 Ha! I read "oil" and "feathers" and my brain immediately took that in the negative. V glad to see a beautiful birdy
2231 2018-06-04 19:10:28 Today in class we ejaculate coconut oil
2232 2018-06-04 19:10:24 Loved this episode. I also like to hang out in my bathroom luxuriating in oil. Dying to know what yr fave body oils are.
2233 2018-06-04 19:10:21 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
2234 2018-06-04 19:10:14 You said bitcoin will make oil production less economic relative to “green energy” sources. I disagree, in fact it could be opposite. 

There is no such thing as “green energy”, it is a buzzword. Although, mining bitcoin using wasted methane is as “green” as it gets.
2235 2018-06-04 19:10:11 Of course she didn’t.  Back then it was her against the world.  Him important, wealthy and she a no body.  Rape is rape.  He forced her as he has many women and young girls.   They all know he is a predator.
2236 2018-06-04 19:10:08 I thought they were "big oil's poodles" or whatever you find self-satisfying today.
2237 2018-06-04 19:10:07 lol whenever somebody says "well rents in NYC can't go up forever!" I'm like, well, I mean, unless oil money guys from UAE keep buying up the property that non-rich people currently live in

2242 2018-06-04 19:09:47 And as US Demand for oil grows, that surplus likely will grow
2243 2018-06-04 19:09:30 You should try supplements; 
Fish oil
B-Complex...(energy)
5-HTP (good before bed, helps serotonin) 
L-Theanine( I like the min chewables, helps calm me down in the moment.)
Vitamin D. (Most of us are very deficient and can be the leading cause for a lot of health problems.)
2244 2018-06-04 19:09:20 israel attacked syria and took the golan, no country on earth recognize conquest like that including the UN which still considers it Syria. It would be so nice others wise since US needs canadian oil.
2245 2018-06-04 19:09:14 Making appointments, sitting in cold lobbies, oil changes, major maintenance.... it’s just boring and time consuming
2246 2018-06-04 19:09:03 Dis you read about the other Grenfell resident who was making cannabis oil and had inflammable canisters in his flat?
2247 2018-06-04 19:08:33 I went and bought omega 3 oil and multivitamin tablets yesterday  to give him with his medicine and got him to rest past 2 days and then he goes and does that when I wasn't there making it worse
2248 2018-06-04 19:08:24 and cannabis derivative products without CBD or THC have always been legal and i think one can have cannabis oil without cannabinoids
2249 2018-06-04 19:08:23 Just a helpful hint for everyone who hates spiders, ants & mice...peppermint oil repels them. Just apply peppermint oil to a cotton ball or q-tip and swipe windowsills & entry door thresholds.  It's safe for households with pets and smells good.
2250 2018-06-04 19:08:19 I've got painful little hands, arms, and wrists and I gotta say cbd oil really does help with em
2251 2018-06-04 19:08:15 @Acosta Yet another damning briefing with no straight answers. (Trump oil: cures all your pains. Made from the greatest snakes on earth.) Dreaming of a government that is accountable to the people again. What an embarrassment.
2252 2018-06-04 19:08:14 Being fed snake oil for 500 Days and we're still going strong #resist
2253 2018-06-04 19:08:12 Maybe I'm over simplifying, but if you want to do BUSINESS, the COMMUNITY grants you a BUSINESS LICENSE.

For that you (tacitly?) agree to conduct your business according to rules and norms. Like not selling tainted meat, snake oil, and YES, serving EQUALLY to anyone who can PAY.
2254 2018-06-04 19:08:04 Getting my oil changed and they told me 37.86 without tax....I supplied the damn oil and the filter bitch... wth am I paying for? Then she told me it will take 30 min to do.. bet....bc my dad can change it in 5...
2255 2018-06-04 19:07:57 @Uber_Support I need to know when my background oil und check review will be completed. It has been 8 days and I am losing money

2262 2018-06-04 19:06:59 and just thinking how hard was it for the oil to be transported to #Kitale by trucks then by rail from Kitale to Mombasa. The rail is already there

2264 2018-06-04 19:06:53 Do you think Norway would be better off if its oil revenues had gone to Stockholm or Copenhagen and had been frittered away?  Presumably you do...?

2267 2018-06-04 19:06:46 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.
2268 2018-06-04 19:06:39 This is reminiscent of John D Rockefeller's (or Henry Flagler, I can't recall which) scheme of rail rebates, where he got paid by railroads when they transported oil which wasn't Standard's. Akin to Standard, the number dealer gets paid for numbers which may not even exist.
2269 2018-06-04 19:06:34 Cool! Thank you so much for that very clearly stated recipe. Would coconut oil either potentiate or conflict? I don't eat canola.

2275 2018-06-04 19:06:01 I agree buying local is always better & I support UK plant-based farming. I don't think anyone agrees with palm oil but the truth is the majority don't care or just don't consider it whilst shopping.
2276 2018-06-04 19:05:51 lol time is amazing, I didn't like Bush when everybody else didn't (mainly off the hype cause I aint know nothing he was doing, I mean Katrina, oil, etc. but not a real grasp on it) but in 2018 I find him enjoyable all he be doing is painting and chilling.
2277 2018-06-04 19:05:50 If you've ever had rough sex with a black girl then you know why they use baby oil in pornos
2278 2018-06-04 19:05:41 I'm an athsmatic and I use Eucalyptus oil to help me breathe better HOWEVER I still need my medicine. Athsma medication is expensive as FUCK. Maybe she didn't have insurance? If she did, then fuck her. I just can't fathom why she would risk his life like that. Smh

2288 2018-06-04 19:04:33 If you haven’t been paying attention, oil demand is increasing rapidly. If you think this fluff piece article signifies that we are a “low-carbon” world you really need to read more.

2296 2018-06-04 19:03:50 Have tried coconut oil!? I found it helped a lot when growing mine out! Also not brushing your hair until it’s dry and if you have to brush it when wet use a wide tooth comb! Also decrease your use of hot tools and using scrunchies decreases breakage!

2299 2018-06-04 19:03:13 @kt_bozo Oof! Did you get the oil changed yet?
2300 2018-06-04 19:03:13 Sorry John your numbers are off. Everyone did average $2k per year. The speaker of the house brags about it all the time. Divide $2k by a family of four. Then decide that by 52 wks. +OPEC decided not to produce more oil so they can increase prices. Trump has yet to say anything.
2301 2018-06-04 19:02:47 Is it oil based? Clean it with oil or fat, other wise you can try alcohol or acetone

Cheers
2331 2018-06-04 19:00:01 Manually inspecting an oil rig is time-consuming, expensive for oil companies, and can even be dangerous for workers. Now, #drones can be deployed to collect the right data in a fraction of the time.

2333 2018-06-04 18:59:38 Hi am looking for a Restaurant/Company around pta/jhb&North West that can supply 30-50×20lt of used cooking oil per week

2334 2018-06-04 18:59:20 Shouldn't we use 'phase out' or 'stop using' palm oil? Usually boycott refers to a temporary action to protest something else. Permanent would be better.
2335 2018-06-04 18:59:06 Need to get on that Greek diet though. Can't recognise my tummy. Not so difficult though, lots of fish, vegetables, fruits, olive oil.
2336 2018-06-04 18:59:05 Tea tree oil might help.

2344 2018-06-04 18:58:24 This sounds amazing, obviously my next #keto recipe! Off to Amazon to buy the required stuff. Or maybe I could upgrade it to synthetic 5W40 oil? To also lube my joints at the same time?
2345 2018-06-04 18:58:20 I’ve owned a car for the last 9 years of my life. They always show me the oil fuel stick and tell me “okay ma’am it’s clean”

2357 2018-06-04 18:56:34 Yes everything he can do to help big oil is all @EPAScottPruitt is doing at the same time trying to say they are cleaning the Air... the @POTUS needs to recognize that the destruction this @EPA is doing won't get him re-elected

2361 2018-06-04 18:56:04 You sir are mistaken, mayo is a great substitute for oil! Adds moisture and fluffiness

2365 2018-06-04 18:55:38 Somewhat related to my earlier tweet: one time Eric kept texting me about funnels to see if it would trigger any ads but it never did.

Then, a month later, a neighbor knocked & asked for a funnel to change his oil and I stood like this  for 30 seconds before answering.
2366 2018-06-04 18:55:35 Nothing feels better than a free oil change  I needed this $54
2367 2018-06-04 18:55:31 Whichever one I am currently commenting on is the clear answer. This sayeth I... Ugh. Whatever. PETER!!! Grab the damn oil already!!
2368 2018-06-04 18:55:27 you’re like the third person i’ve seen talk about cbd oil.... i think i might need to look into this for when my anxiety is unmanaged lol.
2369 2018-06-04 18:55:22 Problem is farmers and ethanol producers only have @ChuckGrassley fighting for them.  @SenTedCruz has @EPAScottPruitt who is all about big oil and @SecretaryPerry.
Corn and ethanol got stuck with @SecretarySonny who is a push over and not a fighter
2370 2018-06-04 18:55:19 Aside from which... palm oil is NOT healthy. It may be less bad than palm kernel oil or coconut oil or trans-fats, but it is still high in saturated fat, which has detrimental effects on the lipid profile.
2371 2018-06-04 18:55:03 Cinnamon oil and/or peppermint oil will persuade God's creepy crawlies to crawl elsewhere.

2381 2018-06-04 18:54:10 Because you backed out of the “Iran Deal”, it caused oil prices to rise. Which, negated any benefits due to higher fuel prices. Winning!!

2384 2018-06-04 18:53:53 As you hear of Apple and Google trying to help you manage your phone addiction, remember oil companies that claim to be environmentalists and cigarette companies claiming to work for a smoke-free future. The peddler of the substance will never be the curer of the substance abuse.

2386 2018-06-04 18:53:22 The idea is that everyone's gets a semi baseline knowledge, but not everyone becomes experts, like people learning to change their oil arent going to be mechanics
2387 2018-06-04 18:53:08 @Lizblacklive please play “Pour Your Oil “ by Joshua Rogers
2388 2018-06-04 18:53:04 When you cut taxes, you cut money available to the gov't.  So where will this money come from?  Perhaps your colleague Scott Pruitt will drill for oil?  Perhaps your party leader will build a hotel there?  Your tolerance for their corruption & lies is acres larger than our #CVNP.
2389 2018-06-04 18:53:02 Getting my oil changed and the man next to me is carrying around his pee in a jug.... can I just have one normal day??? Is that too much to ask

2394 2018-06-04 18:52:30 They said it was trial marketing meant to establish baseline price for Kenyan crude in international oil markets, sensible as trial, long term uneconomical
2395 2018-06-04 18:52:21 Probably yes, as long as that off-shore oil field is not touched (cause the fools can’t agree on how to split it)
2396 2018-06-04 18:52:13 It’s not meant for your skin, the molecules in the oil are too large to be absorbed by your skin and will just clog your pores
2397 2018-06-04 18:51:59 Can you please let me know which are the factors pull the oil company stocks down like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL... like oil price increase etc.,?
2398 2018-06-04 18:51:59 All proceeds from oil Wells in Nigeria must go to the treasury or used in building foreign reserve and building infrastructure. No individual should be lincensed to export oil and keep the proceeds to themselves @ik_osakioduwa #ThingsIWouldLikeToStop

2403 2018-06-04 18:51:33 Do the math on the '19 estimate using those numbers... I get $480mm.   Company told me 30% growth next yr if they stay within cash flow, but they are still using $55 oil.  So IF you believe in $65, its pretty close to 3x on that '19 number (ex debt from capex of course)
2404 2018-06-04 18:51:32 One of my pet peeves is an oil change that takes more than a half hour.

2413 2018-06-04 18:49:29 Anyone else notice that if oil goes us 1 cent gas goes up 10 cents. But when oil goes down almost $8 for the last 13 days fuel still goes up?  #FuelPriceHike

2416 2018-06-04 18:48:53 yes bc the natural oils on your face help protect your skin so stripping them away can cause excessive oil production or if you've got dry skin in general, you'll have a lot of peeling, irritation, damage, etc. so just be careful :-)
2417 2018-06-04 18:48:46 @ $65 oil, 30% NGL realization, $2.75 gas (74%, 12%, 14%), they realize $52.93/boe.  Guided to 22,000-25,000 boe/d in 2018.  Take that up by 35% next year (vs 125% growth this yr). Midpoints: LOE $4.75, GPT $2.875, Cash G&A 2.25, production taxes 5.75%
2418 2018-06-04 18:48:40 The supreme irony is that an MP from one of the parties has the gall to call himself the ‘first citizen of the regions’. The oil and gas ban has the potential to cripple Taranaki’s hard-won prosperity.

2457 2018-06-04 18:45:18 No one is saying stop selling oil. We need to stop expanding the oil sales offshore. We need to invest in value added oil products here for domestic and export use. We need to conserve our natural resources and expand the renewables.

2470 2018-06-04 18:43:13 Save the #LieGate your trade talks are aimed at benefiting your family and cronies! In fact, your daughter received 5 patents, your buddy has benefited from the oil an coal tariffs, who know which cronies benefited from your early leaking of the unemployment report other day!
2471 2018-06-04 18:43:09 Biossance oil cleanser + Korres greek yogurt cleanser have changed my skin. Help with redness + hydrate so well. I do oil at night (removes makeup better than ANYTHING) and wash w/ Korres AM and PM.

Mix everythinge and bake it over fire for a night or un-til screaming stoppes.

Enough for a goat.
2476 2018-06-04 18:42:41 I like to mix my lotion w some body oil & it doesn’t make me sticky! Or I just use body oil by itself, but that’s if you can stand being oily until it dries lmao
2477 2018-06-04 18:42:41 Lol  I like confit garlic cloves, red pepper flakes and a cinnamon stick in olive oil and I use that as the base of my red sauce. You’d be surprise the depth you can get out of those warm spices.
2478 2018-06-04 18:42:36 Hey... YOU... what do you need from Avon? BugGuard bug spray? BugGuard sunscreen? Eyeliner? Skin So Soft Bath oil? Let me know now and I can have by Friday!
2479 2018-06-04 18:42:19 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2480 2018-06-04 18:42:19 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2481 2018-06-04 18:42:17 Se cumplio rebote de corto, ahora a esperar que confirme quiebre U$S11 y ver que pasa con oil y si aclara un poco mas el panorama en brasil. Mucha incertidumbre todavia, sumado al opex de la semana proxima ...

2485 2018-06-04 18:41:41 already know they gonna hit me with the we changed your oil but "we also found"
2486 2018-06-04 18:41:38 He's nothing but a snake oil salesman. He only THINKS he's going to Heaven!!

2491 2018-06-04 18:41:17 This new moon rose oil I made is everyyyything 
2492 2018-06-04 18:41:16 Only Almond oil and fragrance of mehndi is enough for me to turn On :) .
2493 2018-06-04 18:41:12 Oh, the usual. Building toaster bombs and trying to get DumE to stop trying to feed me motor oil.
2494 2018-06-04 18:41:09 Catch me in the parking lot at work just straight huffing my wrists because this new perfume oil I bought smells so good I just can't stop.
2495 2018-06-04 18:40:56 And how much oil is flowing through the factious line? Not one drop.
2496 2018-06-04 18:40:55 for real: when the 45th president talks the 'truth', more than one earthling cries for mama #resist
2497 2018-06-04 18:40:39 Why cant they provide a sustainability program with the same oil and industrialise the region at the same time  make the place a better place to live instead of the whole cost wastage
2498 2018-06-04 18:40:31 Aight twitter, I’m getting my oil changed and I’m bored. Reply to this tweet with memes and jokes plz

2507 2018-06-04 18:39:59 Debating whether to go to the gym with coconut oil in my hair 
2508 2018-06-04 18:39:58 Can I counter with downside catalysts.
1) multi month bond rally due
2) MM'S are exciting longs and initiating shorts.
3) broken intermed trend line
4) dollar continues to rally
5) equity market correction 
6) orange jesus wants lower oil for midterms 
7) still way to many bulls
2509 2018-06-04 18:39:52 XLE Energy Sector SPDR leads US crude oil lower. XLE rose to $78 Dec 2016 and then sold off for 8 months. XLE hit $78 Jan 31, 2018 and sold off for 2 weeks. XLE hit $79 May 22 and will sell of for how long? Less than two week?  WTI has already made its move.
2510 2018-06-04 18:39:51 I got to go get a oil change & I remember last time they had  a black lady waiting on her car eating ALL the complimentary snacks. Think I might try that today
2511 2018-06-04 18:39:46 Energy use per person is likely a good metric of national wealth & strength. The US consumes 730 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) per person.

China, on the other hand, consumes 2.2 TOE/person ...

2512 2018-06-04 18:39:41 Coconut oil is useless, does nothing for my skin or hair. I've used it for a year now. 
2513 2018-06-04 18:39:24 GOD = Gold Oil Drugs
2514 2018-06-04 18:39:19 Asin ehn...I've tried to see reason with Germany's coach but in all scenarios I just don't see how dropping the fastest player in the EPL nd the PFA young player of the year is logical or even tactical..
2515 2018-06-04 18:39:18 Russia is a military super power, but not a financial super power. Their only grip is on the EU & Natural Gas & some oil reserves. China's economy is based on the trade deficit that they have with the US. That is now falling apart. China's existence  depends on the US (period).

2517 2018-06-04 18:39:09 You need grace to do it & plenty anointing oil  alone NADA
2518 2018-06-04 18:39:08 Was it your will that he gave you a shiny penny, and the rich got all the dollar bills with tax reform? Do u like what is happening to our environment, with Pruitt selling off our lands to big business drilling for oil? What exactly is he doing for this country but destroying it!

2528 2018-06-04 18:37:57 Patrice oneal.. he used to smuggle screwdrivers and oil to test the tsa 
2529 2018-06-04 18:37:50 Too little too late. People need to pay attention to whom they're voting for. The snake oil salesmen in the WH is their fault.
2530 2018-06-04 18:37:50 Yeah, sadly almost all the oil & gas companies in Houston are in downtown  or on the west side of town now, and we live up north. We'd thought about moving into the city but then Harvey happened.
2531 2018-06-04 18:37:38 Maybe donnie boy should've stuck to being a reality show has-been then according to Rachinda Sutterfield. And the reason the moron won is because his voters fell for his snake oil spiel hook, line and sinker. MAGA= making America Go Away!
2532 2018-06-04 18:37:36 America now has a god-emperor.  Where will the anointing oil ceremony be held - I want a ticket...
2533 2018-06-04 18:37:28 We all chop garlic at home.....we have to..need it for our cuisine..and many other cuisines......but it always sticks to the blade of the knife right....annoying...drop a little oil on the garlic and chopping board....it won't stick anymore and will chop fine

2537 2018-06-04 18:37:21 had to laugh at commercial fr. libs (?) saying ' don't hand over a blank cheque' - meanwhile a $4.5 BILLION chq fr. libs - going to dirty oil pipeline?
2538 2018-06-04 18:37:17 I love your oil work! 
2539 2018-06-04 18:37:16 Dubai only produces 70,000 barrels of oil per day but look at the magical transformation in that clime.

Nigeria produces 2 million barrels of oil per day and what we experience daily is retrogression.

Thunder fire everyone who has contributed to this reverse motion.
2540 2018-06-04 18:37:12 He said they wasn’t practicing Muslims involved in Rotherham  which is factual wrong , some of them was . People should study the facts of the case before commenting  In such a niave way. paedophilia should be exposed where ever it raises its ugly head in any community

2544 2018-06-04 18:37:00 Funniest n scariest unsolicited medical advice I used to hear was people telling my parents I didn't need surgery. That oil from Jerusalem in a church ran by Brazilian convicts was going to cure me of a tumor. Funny now but scary as a child. What if they would've listened?

2549 2018-06-04 18:36:40 Must be national do things you’ve been putting off day because I’ve made an eye appointment and gotten an oil change so far today. What else should I check off my list?
2550 2018-06-04 18:36:34 Tbh, majority of Black Hair care products are just not good with my hair except for a few organic brands. I do like the Gels from As I Am and Bekura Beauty. But I use that strictly on my ends. I swear by Kerastase and L’Oreal Mythic Oil. My hairdresser loves me for that 
2551 2018-06-04 18:36:32 Have you tried lemon essential oil yet? It's a great one as well as the other citrust oils for boosting appetite, energy, and mood. It was fun to talk with a neighbor whose nursing facility is using it for their residents.
2552 2018-06-04 18:36:32 they could still need some cuticle oil though

2559 2018-06-04 18:35:11 Are we sure about that, though? Does God really want us serving coffee to white nationalists or changing the oil of bigots? Does He really want us bagging groceries for people who scream obscenities at women wearing hijab? I kinda think He'd go Matthew 21:12 on their @$$es.
2560 2018-06-04 18:35:10 Royal Law of Scotland (The Torah) said:

- Man must not interchange Kinds (Genetic Modification)

- Man must not Lust sexually toward other Men (Homosexuality)

2573 2018-06-04 18:33:13 India declined the quad and info pacific this past weekend in Mattis’ presence. This is where trump international relations rubber hits the road. Modi was summoned to Wuhan less than a month ago. These aren’t coincidences with Iranian oil supply being cut off

2606 2018-06-04 18:29:38 Veremos ... se shortea oil o no?
2607 2018-06-04 18:29:30 This is great, but once there are no more jobs thanks to AI and the human population dies off, what is the point of growing crops?  Maybe robots will use vegetable oil for lubrication.
2608 2018-06-04 18:29:21 We will just become like any other poor country producing oil.
2609 2018-06-04 18:29:13 Are you saying that Angus Energy has another method to extract tight oil than hydraulic or acid fracking?
2610 2018-06-04 18:29:09 Has anyone ever come up with a super hero who can expend calories  as blast energy?
Basically eat a pack of 12 donuts then run into battle & explode, but then have to chug olive oil to blast again.
2611 2018-06-04 18:29:06 Proverbs 21:20

Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling, but a foolish man devours it.
2612 2018-06-04 18:29:04 Oily/Acne Prone skin STILL needs moisturizer. Never skip it just because you feel your skin produces too much oil. Your skin can dry out or produce even more oil which lead to breakouts.
2613 2018-06-04 18:28:56 Might wanna change that oil
2614 2018-06-04 18:28:48 My skin is both oily and dry,so annoying trying to find a cleanser,toner  and moisturizer that wont leave me like an oil rig or tight skin 
2615 2018-06-04 18:28:47 And that box be slippery like trying to walk on oil
2616 2018-06-04 18:28:39 I don’t do any of those things and I’m having trouble putting together $70 for a much needed oil change.

2618 2018-06-04 18:28:21 I have been informed by a certain Auburn Sloth, who wishes to remain nameless, that my last tweet does not reflect his opinion and that I have taken unnecessary poetic licensing within it
He's a firm believer in war mongering and has personal investment in Russian oil
I am sorry
2619 2018-06-04 18:28:16 New tires, alignment, and oil change. I need a sugar momma. 
2620 2018-06-04 18:28:11 tahoe needs an oil change
2621 2018-06-04 18:27:55 I have always been for free trade and am trained in Economics and have read many economics texts. But I am convinced we don’t have free trade on these items. For that matter, you could say OPEC doesn’t allow for free trade of oil. The EU has many rules that inhibit free trade.
2622 2018-06-04 18:27:50 Try digging a hole in ur garden... may be u'll find an oil well

2625 2018-06-04 18:27:23 Pro tip: Ensure that when you change the oil in your vehicle, you are always replacing the filters since they are the first line of defense against impurities.
2626 2018-06-04 18:27:19 Take note of copper oil traders. When rates rise there’s a high correlation with both commodities especially when they’re in a forecasted growing deficit.

2629 2018-06-04 18:26:49 Can you switch to PIO in another oil? There are several alternatives. I’ve used both the ethyl oleate and sesame oil alternatives when regular PIO was out of stock.
2630 2018-06-04 18:26:43 次買うのsurfaceだと思うし
2631 2018-06-04 18:26:25 No because coulds mights and maybes are not facts, the EU doesn’t produce oil, we do, and the Middle East, the US etc. We are 2nd in the world for Pharmaceutical production and food like oil goes up and down for many reasons. Nothing to do with Brexit.
2632 2018-06-04 18:26:25 Hey bambino tell us all how you would set up whole fields of fake olive trees  on the South to get them free subsidies for the oil industry

2655 2018-06-04 18:24:00 Once again, Big Oil/Gas buy votes they need to get what they want. The little guy gets the shaft. This grows old. Meanwhile, we are allowing them to export to highest worldwide bidder, raising prices at the pump, costing little guy even more. We are a stupid lot.

2662 2018-06-04 18:23:08 All that extra largesse will be squandered over Trump's trade wars (increased price of goods), higher gas/oil prices, and out of control health insurance costs. But, sure, enjoy the appearance of more money while it lasts.
2663 2018-06-04 18:23:00 @jimmygotyme @MichelleRempel oils still sells at world prices even if the oil was nationalized. It Just means more money for Canada

2666 2018-06-04 18:22:29 The ayurveda nutrition advice for my body is literally: do not eat meat, dairy, sugar, carbs, salt, nuts, or oil. And also i cant eat a variety of vegetables and fruits. 
2667 2018-06-04 18:22:25 True. We turned on an oil heater before 18:00, trust me there's no difference even now. 
2668 2018-06-04 18:22:24 Just a little virgin olive oil
2669 2018-06-04 18:22:12 Had to drop 4 things of laundry off now go ship off orders go get a oil change 
2670 2018-06-04 18:22:03 Also, I have a soy allergy, and you'd be surprised the number of places use soybean oil. That shit is everywhere. My Mom tried my diet once and gave up half a day in.
2671 2018-06-04 18:21:57 Try lavender oil. It will relieve some of the pain and may help. You know that it has been used for centuries. It cannot hurt you. I sympathize with you, and wish you a speedy recovery.
2672 2018-06-04 18:21:57 Hi Sam. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks

2680 2018-06-04 18:20:27 Idk now. That oil hell too 
2681 2018-06-04 18:20:23 Black unemployment has been steadily decreasing well before Trump.Maybe he should work his magic on gas prices.Oh that's right his big oil buddies would get mad at poor little Donald.The Trump Show is the biggest reality shows ever and filmed primarily in the white house.
2682 2018-06-04 18:20:23 Me and most people don’t mix like oil and water...
2683 2018-06-04 18:20:16 ...and plenty more. Just TODAY. Not even looking at what their TV\Radio\Paper-printed dedicated political debates are showing.
Last week it was re: failures in medical professional recruitment. Oil fund & investments, equality, pension and the revised budget.
2684 2018-06-04 18:20:15 Everytime I go to Jersey Mikes and ask for a little oil and vinegar my sandwich gets turned into pudding... I feel you. 
2685 2018-06-04 18:20:13 just tried this all day lipstick for the first time and i had to SCRUB my fucking face with OLIVE OIL for a SOLID 10 MINUTES TO GET IT OFF bc that’s just how much this shit /does not fuck around/
2686 2018-06-04 18:19:49 You can and we will be forced to use alternative energy sources when oil runs out. There is no alternative to water.
2687 2018-06-04 18:19:40 Better than that oil
2688 2018-06-04 18:19:29 there is a fine line between support and getting involved, moral support yes, not arming Arabs against zionist, as you are sucked in the proxy war in Syria and wasting oil revenue which is not yours is Iranian people in the middle east. need to start looking after your own people
2689 2018-06-04 18:19:28 We can't be making such a close correlation between the oil price and government inefficiency surely, one could argue that those two are worlds apart,

The oil shipped by rail has been significantly reduced &thus the risk of derailment has been significantly reduced.

2704 2018-06-04 18:17:38 If you are directing  that at me, totally agree. If you look at the biggest picture, the US and its arms industry, oil ambitions and unquestioned support for settlor colonial Israel, are the core of US foreign policy of endless war. Please Look at who fights in class terms.

Yet our fuel prices were in the region of R12.50 per ltr . Somth stinks
2723 2018-06-04 18:14:26 New favorite past time: watching people forget how to drive their cars as soon as they pull in to get an oil change.
2724 2018-06-04 18:14:23 Don't get your cheese from an oil refinery. Life lessons.

2727 2018-06-04 18:14:14 Why can’t Kenya build its own refinery, refine it’s oil, Block any imports, service using own oil then only export the surplus?

2742 2018-06-04 18:12:49 We need all kinds of energy. Not just gas and oil. And we, as individuals, need to be allowed to have our own energy source. We shouldn't be slaves to big energy companies.

2748 2018-06-04 18:12:27 The real story is the GOP has allowed a foreign takeover of the country financed by the Koch Brothers who's father helped Russia (Stalin) develop their oil production. GOP Senators and Representatives made out like bandits because they are bandits. #CriminalGOP #Treason #impeach

2750 2018-06-04 18:12:09 Also when you buy your avocado  put them in the fridge to keep them fresh and take them out a day before u want to eat. let them rest for a day. They will be perfect to eat the following. And justincase, seasoning is- sea salt, black pepper, lime juice (not lemon), and olive oil.

2758 2018-06-04 18:11:17 Cet par, multi-currency pricing of oil is very oil bearish w gold at $1295 (if free mkt is allowed to work).  So either multi-currency oil pricing must be stopped, or free market must not be allowed to work, or gold must be allowed to rise.  US appear to be trying options 1 & 2.

2760 2018-06-04 18:11:04 It honestly ticks me off that America isn't leading the world in renewable energy production. We're more focused on finding new ways to get oil rather than mass-production of renewable energy.
2761 2018-06-04 18:11:02 try castor oil ! u can get a decent sized bottle of it at whole foods for $7. u can mix it in ur shampoo/conditioner and also just rub it in

2787 2018-06-04 18:07:32 Just realized it's slightly more complex than this. There are only 3 refineries that supply our region & they've been undergoing 'routine maintenance' one after the other. Also, Alberta is trying to cut BC off of their oil supply due to a fight over a proposed oil line.
2788 2018-06-04 18:07:30 Any body does oil changes in independence asap
2789 2018-06-04 18:07:28 I need to tell everybody: I had a deep line (wrinkle) in between my eyebrows that would stay after I pushed my brows together. Over 6 months ago I started using ROSEHIP OIL on my face at night and y’all... I’m not kidding the wrinkle is basically GONE.
2790 2018-06-04 18:07:15 Also we dont have oil or gas and we have shortage of water and more than 90% of jordan is desert..
2791 2018-06-04 18:07:15 Wow! the same Koch bros who have backed/financed enviro groups such as greenpeace etc. to protest against any pipelines that don’t go directly to their refineries in order to keep that cheap Canadian oil below wti $ and into their pockets. 
Go figure?
2792 2018-06-04 18:06:49 The people that can fathom a barrel of crude oil skyrocketing in price belong to a duality of their own introspective reality.

2812 2018-06-04 18:04:42 Meanwhile your government is telling us we have to expand the oil sands and buy/build out new fossil fuel infrastructure.
2813 2018-06-04 18:04:38 Also real talk. Canada keeps selling away what little industry it has and screwing over its agricultural industry and shale oil to foreign companies. You have nothing to stand on just be happy you're our hat.

2816 2018-06-04 18:04:08 The oil is more than available. Look, we can use vegetable oil even now to drive our cars, with relatively minor modification. We can make plastic products out of hemp. We could have had it all by now, but for the interference of big oil corp owners. The time to move on is now.

2823 2018-06-04 18:03:27 Hofer/FPOe in government so far publicizing their push for: hydrogen vehicles, electric vehicle charging stations on highways, more park & ride, shifting more freight from road to rail, ban on installing oil heating systems in new constructions, photovoltaic systems on roofs, etc
2824 2018-06-04 18:03:24 @Twisp_SA Cresta Mall kiosk out of oil stock AGAIN. What is the point of having devices if it can't be used? Terrible supplying. And never the plan to assist customer, unless at my own cost in ordering online. Perhaps just throw the thing away and be done with it!

2830 2018-06-04 18:02:52 This is all very good but have the Greeks tried a peanut butter sandwich with olive oil instead of butter?
2831 2018-06-04 18:02:47 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
2832 2018-06-04 18:02:44 Once we realize that borders only exist in our minds, we are better off, patriotism, religion, etc. are great, but just like olive oil, WE MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THEM!
2833 2018-06-04 18:02:23 I try not to buy products with palm oil but it's in a lot & not just vegans food. You can either pay for suffering & death or try your best not to, being vegan is the least we can do.

2840 2018-06-04 18:01:07 I’ve used essential oil, medicine, and a heating pad and i still feel like I’m dying. Help.
2841 2018-06-04 18:01:07 maybe you could close down #Israel then or ban all those 'Friends of Israel' groups that explicitly support the terror that #Israel exports? Or, do you only want to be tough on those who have oil and resources that the UK & allies might want, such as Palestinian land? #Liar
2842 2018-06-04 18:01:05 But they don't believe in $60 Oil either
2843 2018-06-04 18:01:04 I think you boys are being a little too defensive. EVERY oil play is being depleted. I simply pointed out that multiple oil-bearing formations in North Dakota’s geology provide opportunity for oil extraction to continue for many decades to come. The state’s production is growing.

2856 2018-06-04 17:59:59 @StationCDRKelly suggestion: start ingesting cannabis oil with Thc nightly. Ingest cbd cannabis oil from cannabis not hemp daily. This will help all your health issues from space. Also look up Dr Joe dispenza.

2865 2018-06-04 17:58:45 At this rate it won't be surprising to have the oil production thing so praised becoming a mega scum in East and Central African and maybe The entire world.
2866 2018-06-04 17:58:29 Arabia will be out of oil in 4 yrs. How long before our pipeline is done?? Things will start to get REALLY evil if we're without oil. Believe me, all your accomplishments will be forgotten.  Best 2 b done b4 the  end of your 1st term, or there may not b a 2nd!
2867 2018-06-04 17:58:19 I use a can of chickpeas (cuz lazy lol) juice if one large lemon, a good tablespoon of tahini(sometimes I use it sometimes I don’t Lmao) and 2/3 garlic cloves. Wrap them up in some foil with olive oil and sea salt and roast it until it’s soft) and blend! And black pepper
2868 2018-06-04 17:58:15 Test an economy by considering how it performs with $20 barrel oil. USA has the only economy that would grow (transportation and manufacturing growth would be greater than hit to energy sector). Everyone else gets crushed. And USA with 100 lb weights strapped to each limb.

2874 2018-06-04 17:57:35 The rise in oil prices over the past six-nine months will have a mixed effect on economies in Latin America, with Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador the biggest winners, and Chile the biggest loser.

2883 2018-06-04 17:57:02 Was it drilling for oil?

2886 2018-06-04 17:56:45 & when you take your protective style out , make sure you mix Avacado, coconut oil, coconut milk ,olive oil, banana, eggs & honey & blend all together, detangle your hair with it & leave it for an hour with a nylon cap to have the moisture in there. That’s feeding your hair
2887 2018-06-04 17:56:39 Spoken like a true dictator. You keep throwing out this garbage hoping it will stick, but less and less people are buying your snake oil every time. You might escape impeachment, but once you’re voted out in 2020, the state prosecutors will have their day!
2888 2018-06-04 17:56:35 Coconut oil thank you!
2889 2018-06-04 17:56:29 It really makes you wonder where all that extra money goes (money that isn't taxes,  because we know where those go), and some have suspected oil companies  are keeping it as profits because they know the demand for gas/oil is pretty elastic.
2890 2018-06-04 17:56:26 CBD oil changes lives ppl. If you have anxiety & dont want to be medicated, I highly recommend trying it. It is a safe, organic alternative & truly works wonders.
2891 2018-06-04 17:56:25 Hot oil should be poured on the backside of these buggers & after wards third degree treatment. This excercise will teach them lesson on Desh Bhakti, if not repeat the process!!
2892 2018-06-04 17:56:23 While you can't drink oil, you can't drill for water or irrigate or lots of other stuff w/out oil. And, by price, do we pay $3.50/g for water?

2901 2018-06-04 17:54:29 Karin, you seem very bitter… Would you care to elaborate?  In our experience, we have not seen many, if any, cases of oil you are discussing. We’ve seen quite a few. Perhaps, you can share your experience that has caused you so much discomfort?
2902 2018-06-04 17:54:27 Oil / REVENUE of last book Stolen and Wasted. The saying goes 'Those Can't Teach' at least at public schools. All these make work/ welfare/ cepep type programs must end. And DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ASAP. T&T NEEDS to put it's own house in order RIGHT NOW.
2903 2018-06-04 17:54:17 Nigeria neglected agriculture coz they had oil and they paid dearly for that. Tends in Kenya now  show declining investment in agriculture at a time and oil attraction all the attention. All this while we watch. Oil will benefit a few whereas agriculture benefits millions
2904 2018-06-04 17:54:10 Only if US can succeed in creating a new "Iron Curtain" around Russia, Iran, Venezuela, & several other EM's.  Fail that, & outlook for oil prices seems quite poor, IMO.

2909 2018-06-04 17:53:27 Hi, thanks for getting back to me. So just to be clear, the palm oil in the ingredient you use for your lemon dessert is sustainable RSPO? Thanks!
2910 2018-06-04 17:53:20 Caveat re: last RT. There's no legal way to obtain CBD oil here in Georgia, but there's no legal way to obtain weed, either. Finding a connection for CBD oil would at least expose them to fewer potential penalties.
2911 2018-06-04 17:52:46 Growing palm oil kills wild animals, land and indigenous peoples so I dont see it so black & white as you but good luck with it.
2912 2018-06-04 17:52:42 My goal is to learn to change my own oil
2913 2018-06-04 17:52:39 So like I’m making a shower scrub... should I not use the coconut oil?
2914 2018-06-04 17:52:33 Swimming in crude oil now...no need for food for fuel policy. Paris is for Canadians. Deregulate and compete.
2915 2018-06-04 17:52:18 You may recall a news item from a months ago about Justin Trudeau's government selling 70 billion dollars worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia so they can go massacre people in Yemen. Or maybe factor in all the climate refugees that will be created through the use of Canadian oil.

2938 2018-06-04 17:48:56 I think it might be the zinc oxide, if it’s too dry try adding a little facial oil. I have one similar that’s fragrance free and it can be a little thick.

2951 2018-06-04 17:47:25 Retweeted Onye Nkuzi (@cchukudebelu):

Azerbaijan has roughly 30 years worth of crude oil left, it wants to transit to a logistics based economy.

Questions.
1. How many more years of crude oil does Nigeria have left?
2. What does Nigeria want to transit to?
2952 2018-06-04 17:47:25 Strange Fuel Fund calculations =Unexplainable Blaming the dollar and oil prices .We seem to remember that not as long as months ago the Rand was over  R14 to the U$ and Oil was neat U$ 100 per barrel. Yet our fuel prices were in the region of R12.50 per ltr . Something stinks
2953 2018-06-04 17:47:23 Impact: Price Rise due to high demand . Ppl anyways made it to ofc. Ppl prefering public transport or rideshare chose to their own means f transport. In order to avoid blocked roads, they covered 1-2 km extra resulting in higher oil  demand tht vl lead to price rise.
2954 2018-06-04 17:47:21 I hate when they do that, like change the oil and stfu

Then at our primary market for oil.

2969 2018-06-04 17:45:41 Neither Corbyn nor Venezuela's Maduro are communists. Venezuela's problems derive largely from an economy based in export of one major product, oil, and if the opposition gets in power the oil fields will be sold to foreign companies. Then you will see real misery
2970 2018-06-04 17:45:40 The total amount of oil discovered in Kenya is equivalent to one well of oil in Angola and Nigeria. Its too small for media and country to concentrate on talking of. Ur shocking the world. Its economically negative. Do comparison to other countries

3013 2018-06-04 17:39:56 Things I've bought with DevEx cash: Chipotle; an HDMI cable; some pens; more Chipotle; oil.

3014 2018-06-04 17:39:45 Makes me so angry that such snake oil people are slithering around the educational establishment
3015 2018-06-04 17:39:43 A [mature] Christian is a wonder; he is the most contented yet the least satisfied: he is contented with a little of the world, but not satisfied with a little of grace; he would have still more faith and be anointed with fresh oil (Thomas Watson).

3021 2018-06-04 17:38:53 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life,
and i shall dwell in the house of the LORD
forever.

3023 2018-06-04 17:38:44 So your passing the Blake for your crappy product onto people who aren’t verified to clean it up?  That’s like blaming the birds for the oil spill.
3024 2018-06-04 17:38:35 Energy101!
Where Does Energy Come From?
Energy Sources
Coal Source
Natural Gas Source
Oil Source!!!
3025 2018-06-04 17:38:29 Our alliance won’t last with our current increase in natural gas an oil exports. Within a decade or two it will end
3026 2018-06-04 17:38:17 Have you tried CBD oil? Hear it works well for some folks. Hope all settles down for you!
3027 2018-06-04 17:38:16 Actually, worse. If we burned the 173bn barrels of oil in the tarsands, it would mean Canada, with less than 1/2 of 1% of the world's population will use up 30% of the remaining global carbon budget if we are to stay at 1.5 deg. @billmckibben 
That is not what Canadian are about.
3028 2018-06-04 17:38:13 Please press them on oil/gas fracking - in neighborhoods as well as all our public lands.

3030 2018-06-04 17:37:49 Making this Monday my bitch. I’ve already walked my dog, mowed the lawn, got my oil changed, burned 1500 cals at the gym and now I’m walking into work with a purse full of fresh cherries and almonds 
3031 2018-06-04 17:37:46 So does this explain why skin cancer rates in Australia keep climbing. Despite intense Slip Slop Slap campaign here ? Seed oil consumption here is high. @gillespi
3032 2018-06-04 17:37:42 Azerbaijan has roughly 30 years worth of crude oil left, it wants to transit to a logistics based economy.

Questions.
1. How many more years of crude oil does Nigeria have left?
2. What does Nigeria want to transit to?
3033 2018-06-04 17:37:28 WTI oil continues to edge lower on supply concerns, -$0.30 to $65.51/barrel.
3034 2018-06-04 17:37:14 Jason thinks we should just rely on oil and clean ethical Alberta coal, its unpossible that prices could go down for a third time.

3037 2018-06-04 17:36:39 Wouldn’t deny Islam has massive issues. Spread of Wahhabism etc. But there’s another huge reason too - the M.East. Oil. Western military interventions & relentless wars in the religion has escalated extremism ten-fold where other regions wouldn’t have had this issue.
3038 2018-06-04 17:36:37 We all die, it's just a matter of when. Personally I look forward to leaving this"Prison Planet"and this"Prison body"that just ages..

3039 2018-06-04 17:36:34 And “who Thomas is what he’s done before?” 

You mean fighting for oil royalty rights of Kelantan?

You mean fighting for the family members of those on MH 370?

You mean upholding the constitution? 

Keluhuran Perlembagaan much?
3040 2018-06-04 17:36:31 He has destroyed it. City fan before oil money so by no means plastic. Think he's bigger than the club completely pissed all over his legacy.
3041 2018-06-04 17:36:31 The price of kerosene oil, widely used in rural Sri Lanka for cooking & in lamps has been doubled as per directives of the IMF. Galloping #Usury
3042 2018-06-04 17:36:29 People blame Trudeau for continuing with oil pipelines, but in order to keep people employed and our economy good, he needs to. Yes, invedt in green tech. But his hands are tied when it comes to oil.
3043 2018-06-04 17:35:58 Powell whould know since he became an int'l disgrace by spouting WMD lies at the UN to start the Iraq war for Cheney's oil corridor (Baku Azerbaijan, Caspian Sea connection there; still on w TrumpRussia corruption & Cheney's Blackwater mercenary EricPrince, old pal of PenceKnew).

3045 2018-06-04 17:35:55 Actually, a lot worse than that. If we burned the 173bn barrels of oil, it would mean Canada with less than 1% of the world's population will have used up 30% of the remaining global carbon budget if we are to stay at 1.5 deg. @billmckibben

3055 2018-06-04 17:35:08 Have stopped buying anything containing palm oil, and also gasoline and diesel. 
PEOPLE can decide whether or not to support these companies. They will act, or go bankrupt, when the pressure builds up

3058 2018-06-04 17:34:48 I blame entirely on Harper and tube PCs. They rigged the system when they were in power to keep any type of green energy off the table. Harper sunk so much of Canada's economy into oil and fossil fuels, Trudeau has little choice but keep the status quo so not to break our economy
3059 2018-06-04 17:34:34 Coconut oil is by far the best thing I’ve ever tanned with

3068 2018-06-04 17:33:44 That depends on the type of olive oil though, I use EVOO for most things which has a lower smoke point than canola/vegetable ... package says use a vegetable oil so that’s what I used and it still burned fast SOOOO I dunno.
3069 2018-06-04 17:33:33 Why the fuck is the club in lock down at a time like this? Speak with your fanbase you oil sippers
3070 2018-06-04 17:33:33 No problem, we are still laying foundations for optimized production. Oil production if not managed will may be a disaster, check on events in Nigeria
3071 2018-06-04 17:33:32 Now that our country plan to export "Kenya oil" from Turkana, when do local motorists, manufacturers, producers and households will start enjoy reduction in prices of petrol,diesel n kerosene? Because they have suffered alot. @WilliamsRuto @UKenyatta @johnmunyes63

3077 2018-06-04 17:33:14 The top two sources of US oil are (#1) Canada, (#2) Saudi Arabia, and your president just labeled Canada a national security threat.

Hope you have a bicycle.
3078 2018-06-04 17:33:04 So the miners trapped in the cave-in and the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald were better off than the wives at home? Those lucky oil rig guys with the missing fingers are better off than the women back home? The thousands of Commonwealth soldiers fed to the cannons were benefitted?
3079 2018-06-04 17:33:02 Aaaaand the Internet is taking a shit.

Oh well, I gotta go change the oil in my dying mini van, might as well get chores done now

3081 2018-06-04 17:32:53 Senate uses $53m in BP oil spill money for operating budget...which they have said they would do for weeks. The House GOP seems upset with that proposal. #lalege #lagov
3082 2018-06-04 17:32:45 Also not forgetting that our similar oil wealth windfall, which they wisely invested for any future setbacks and used to the public good, was pissed away and/or "privatised" by Thatcher and her cronies! #bbcpm
3083 2018-06-04 17:32:42 I don’t know what’s more mesmerizing, watching wind farms, or watching those little oil pumps on road trips. 
3084 2018-06-04 17:32:34 Hi @barkbox I have a Q with your CBD oil for dogs, would it be okay to give to a cat? My cat has Eosinophilic granuloma. She's on constant steroid meds as it's the only thing that helps her inflammation, irritation, &pain. It isn't so nice on her little body & I wanted to try CBD
3085 2018-06-04 17:32:34 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3086 2018-06-04 17:32:33 When President, Jimmy Carter warned Americans that all the world's oil would be completely depleted by the year 2000.

The truth: oil reserves in America alone will last at least another 200 years.

Never trust Malthusian religiosity to explain resources. They're always wrong. 
3087 2018-06-04 17:32:30 Joe Rogan used to drink coffee mixed with mct oil but had to quit because the oil was causing too much mucus. Just a thought.
3088 2018-06-04 17:32:30 I’m crying, literally, while sitting in NTB waiting for an oil change because the guy who is arguably the greatest artistic genius of our age is worried that his childhood classmates might treat him differently. Like he doesn’t WANT them to idolize him. Best human ever.
3089 2018-06-04 17:32:28 Delete my previous tweet cause typo but hahha what I wanna say is it's just dumb la PR wrongly that's not the way although i cannot deny im secretly happy that they are shaming blinks but it that's just adding oil to the fire LOL cause yknow #triggered

Khotai ki bachi 5 saal men koo durable project kiye hote electricity generation k to gamjay ko pata hota kahan gai bijli
3091 2018-06-04 17:32:12 Even small producers should want to stop when expected prices fall below their marginal costs. As I understand it, the issue with gas in the Permian is it's all co-produced with oil. The drillers are after the oil which pays for the projects. The gas is just gravy.
3092 2018-06-04 17:32:07 Senate used $53M in BP oil spill recovery money to pay for operating expenses. Several House Republicans objecting to that proposal, in addition to tax levels used by the Senate. BP money is supposed to go to rainy day fund and a nursing home trust fund. #lalege #lagov

3097 2018-06-04 17:31:11 Water has always been more valuable than oil. How long can you last in the back country without water? Or, during the zombie apocalypse? You can’t drink oil!
3098 2018-06-04 17:31:10 Not so many Kenyans were in to the oil affair. It only seemed like the Turkana community and the government affair
3099 2018-06-04 17:31:07 Nymex wti crude oil traders... I have given PROFIT  in just  25  days  $4900  U.S  Dollars.  I have given non stop profit without sl hit i have given serial profit.  So don't waste time if you want to make profit take my service and earn without tension. ....
3100 2018-06-04 17:31:00 Luckily for you it's not your tax dollars. We use kroners in my country. We're even deeper in the soup than you are. Thank goodness we have oil, or it wouldn't have worked.
3101 2018-06-04 17:30:50 I hate when people are like, Well you’re just not DOING it right. 

But. 

Go find the curliest kale you can, rip it into bite-sized pieces, fry it up with a glug of oil and a sprinkle of salt, fry until crispy in parts. 

Eat it.

3114 2018-06-04 17:29:45 wait for it: feta, salami, avocado, romaine, spinach, tomato, onion, red pepper flakes and just .... olive oil
3115 2018-06-04 17:29:38 @Sharon_Momanyi Whats the hurry for in the whole business of oil?  Kenya should develop its refineries as well as pipeline system from Turkana #TheBigStory
3116 2018-06-04 17:29:35 The inventory of oil producing assets decline by approx 10%/year. So by simply not drilling and allowing the production to run off, this industry can shrink much much faster tat renewables can grow. But zealots lose to use this argument about stranded assets to scare capital away

I'm 110% for human rights w/o one exception or equivocation. But if another letter is added to this alphabet soup of identity politics, I'm driving to Alaska's Brooks Range in my electric car. It'll be less complicated around the oil rigs I've fought against for 35yrs.

3132 2018-06-04 17:28:00 Palm oil companies are bulldozing vast swaths of tropical forests and destroying biodiversity and wiping out unknown numbers of irreplaceable species of plants and insects and exterminating wildlife leaving bare dust and raw earth behind.
3133 2018-06-04 17:27:57 So is that oil or acrylic?

3140 2018-06-04 17:27:18 Makes sense to have long term strategic partnerships extend into military and defence if both your economy’s also depend on not stabbing each other in the back and working in tandem over joint agreements on future oil production.

3148 2018-06-04 17:26:43 Belated birthday wishes, Dorri. I love that you add oil to the lamps of students through international travel.
3149 2018-06-04 17:26:40 We are fighting like hell to get Beto O'Rourke, who is running against Cruz, elected. Beto is a great Democratic choice for senator. But he's up against the Kochs machine, money, gerrymandering in Texas, and Oil.Everyone should support Beto, he only takes small donations.
3150 2018-06-04 17:26:38 Saudi Arabia wants to do an IPO for Aramco in 2019. It now looks like some of the oil reserves included as assets of Aramco are actually in Yemen. It looks like the war in Yemen by UAE and Saudi is about getting controls of the oil reserves before the Aramco IPO in 2019.
3151 2018-06-04 17:26:35 For me it’s Hormone! It’s actually depends on your body. Like for me, i need to reduce fats intake from dairy products but fats from plants are okay (like avo, nuts, fish oil). I just started develop this skin problem in this past year . thanks God, it’s getting better now 
3152 2018-06-04 17:26:08 Two and a half hours for an oil change. Jeez.
3153 2018-06-04 17:26:02 Wisdom was to mine this oil for domestic purposes. Cut down on our oil imports.Refine the oil at Turkana.  How feasible is it to transport oil from Turkana to Mombasa by Road?
3154 2018-06-04 17:25:24 He's not forgetting. He's either completely ignorant of them or completely disregarding them as he doesn't agree with our #COTUS.
3155 2018-06-04 17:24:53 So let’s see... Tell me which countries will continue to drill in the arctic even if the USA stops... Russia? Norway? Canada? Greenland (Denmark) could use a few Oil $$$. Will they stop drilling? Nope.. they need the $$ to support their socialist programs..

3165 2018-06-04 17:23:11 That's the first thing I tried. Also ammonia-based cleaners, rubbing alcohol, acetone, cooking oil. Nothing else affected it *one bit*.
3166 2018-06-04 17:23:07 @DOEDoobs ive been waiting so long order from your family. i cant think of any better housewarming gift to give myself.

so about this body oil: jasmine, basil and succulent, or lavendar? I CANT DECIDE.
3167 2018-06-04 17:23:00 Gna try almond oil on my skin. I’ll cry if my body hates it

3169 2018-06-04 17:22:49 We are still investigating but we believe it’s algae caused by the heavy rain and heat and there does not appear to be a source of oil in the area. Thanks!
3170 2018-06-04 17:22:38 Because big oil doesn't want it?
3171 2018-06-04 17:22:31 Fox, & trump can promote whatever theory that wish. The only people who will buy the snake oil they are selling are their supporters.
3172 2018-06-04 17:22:27 You are clearly forgetting the McDonald & Caetano cases. The McDonald case incorporated the whole #2A against the states and Caetano case confirmed what is "in common use" when it comes to arms is 2A protected.

3177 2018-06-04 17:22:00 I’m not sure whether this is exactly true, but I have heard that the muppeteers couldn’t have Cookie Monster eat real cookies because the oil in the cookies would have left stains on the muppet fabric.
3178 2018-06-04 17:21:52 It's a tough one. I tend to get lavender oil to rub on hit bits. It makes me feel cared for. I needed to find ways to soothe my inner child as well as my actual children.

3182 2018-06-04 17:21:29 For sure. But if you recall, Sasol has never been "cheaper" than "oil" fuel. Was supposed to be but the govt. got on the band wagon and has ripped us off from day one.
3183 2018-06-04 17:21:25 I love the south because you can be sitting in a waiting room at the oil place and just have a conversation with a room full of women you’ll never see again and you leave with 3 new life lessons and a new grand baby
3184 2018-06-04 17:21:20 Canada following the path of Venezuela. Step1) Incubate a culture of economic out patients with easy money. 2) insert greedy power hungry leftist politicians and chase out big oil and large corps. 3) nationalize resource industry by over paying and installing inept Mgt, Step 4)?
3185 2018-06-04 17:21:06 Read the bottom sentence, you are so taking that article out of context but thanks for linking it so people can read it for themselves and get the full message that the ATB was sending. It will only get worse now that Oil & Gas Co's are competing with Gov't in that sector! ie KM
3186 2018-06-04 17:21:02 12:28 Now king Babylon told him rewarding and clothe, and hid the oil of the word of the LORD, and strengthened the land of the LORD your God.
3187 2018-06-04 17:20:50 @carteblanchetv @Our_DA @enca Can SA consumers have an insight of Fuel from coal costs from Sasol .Something stinks, historically the cost of a barrel of oil from coal was far below World U$ denominated Opec Cartel prices

3189 2018-06-04 17:20:42 Ack! Who would applaud the Koch brothers? Their Dad helped start the Bolshevik oil industry in Russia. The very one that is fueling the climate change hoax to get America off oil and dominate the European markets which makes the Koch brothers even richer. #doubledippers

3192 2018-06-04 17:20:21 My oldest son works in the oil fields of Texas. 6 days a week, 13 hour days making $$$. They can’t find enough workers. So grateful to TRUMP for bringing back the power of America and Americans

3194 2018-06-04 17:20:12 So I’m getting my oil changed and this guy is asleep on the couch by his aunt and he starts snoring really loud and his aunt goes, “Dang Jeremiah you sleeping real good for someone who ain’t even got a job.” 
3195 2018-06-04 17:20:07 Sorry @NicPalmer. We have mainly invited food businesses as it is easy for them to switch to products that use sustainable palm oil but anybody is welcome! The more the merrier! The children will be talking about different types of products as it includes cleaning items too.
3196 2018-06-04 17:19:53 You made a big hole in country’s economy. Pls also mention how much was inflation? Subsidy amount? Oil on credit from Iran? UPA had pushed the economy to fragile 5.
3197 2018-06-04 17:19:53 1 died  it had ripped off an entire wing in the struggle. 2 came off with some oil. People are pathetic.
3198 2018-06-04 17:19:30 Why wouldn't I vote 4 @AGBecerra? He took the max from both @Chevron & their sleazy firm @gibsondunn. Big oil already controls our fed govt. CA needs an independent AG. Chevron is responsible for the worst oil-related disaster in HISTORY & GD helps them try to escape justice.
3199 2018-06-04 17:19:24 Do corn farmers ever sleep? How about anyone in the military? Or oil company executives? If so, I would like my taxpayer subsidies back.

3210 2018-06-04 17:18:43 That oil is more of a curse than a blessing for the people of Turkana.

3213 2018-06-04 17:18:31 The burden can't be all that great? Our government loses children (allegedly), can't track illegals. So NONE of us are giving up our right to bear arms. Good luck trying. We will not comply with unconstitutional laws that contradict the Founders' intent for our self protection.
3214 2018-06-04 17:18:31 Trump's idiocy is the best thing to happen to Trudeau .. dude buys an oil pipeline one day & is a hero the next... lol
3215 2018-06-04 17:18:24 America destroys everything it interferes with, more especially if there’s large amounts of oil not being sold by American companies
3216 2018-06-04 17:18:22 It's so frustrating...and deceiving! When you have food allergies, it's like a full-time job reading labels to avoid dying. So when a brand advertises "olive oil" for instance, it can be quite dangerous. It's not olive oil mayo if it has other oil in it! #disappointed
3217 2018-06-04 17:18:10 Need to so some work.  

I do like $PVAC as a oil-y story not exposed to the permian basis concerns, but rather getting a LLS premium.  Arguably trading at ~3x next yr ebitdax at $65 oil.

3226 2018-06-04 17:17:10 Still not illegal to purchase machine guns, no matter the date on the law. Just cost prohibitive to get the older versions. Fun to shoot though. :D
3227 2018-06-04 17:17:06 The cost of producing a barrel of oil from coal is far below the Opec Cartel price.The Nat Government survived world sanctions with SASOL  and the ANC is wiping our economy out with it.

3245 2018-06-04 17:14:19 It is clear now who steals Syrian oil. The Kurds and the Americans have accused ISIS, while the truth is that ISIS can not sell oil alone without the help of the Kurds. Oil passes through areas under their control and then through Iraqi Kurdistan

3254 2018-06-04 17:13:22 There's no shortage of oil for transitioning. Decades worth, but let's hope we don't use it all. The whole point is ridding us of the multitude of issues surrounding that industry.

3260 2018-06-04 17:12:56 I stepped out of BAS in November of 13. Currently doing IT Ops (mostly via Help Desk and Networking) for a "small" oil and gas company. 

Clearly, we need to catch up. I'll DM you.
3261 2018-06-04 17:12:54 What are you not understanding about what I'm saying. Coal and oil will run out soon, and even before then the enviroment would be so badly damaged that it wouldn't be viable to use coal and oil
3262 2018-06-04 17:12:53 Norway wants a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the UK. Should there be a shortfall in supply before that FTA is signed we can either import oil from Norway at zero tariffs or import oil from elsewhere. After Brexit, we will set our own tariffs.
3263 2018-06-04 17:12:53 That oil is to be used to eradicate swamp snakes like you,  Brennan.  Very useful snake oil indeed.
3264 2018-06-04 17:12:50 @BillClinton look stupid. What's the difference between him & @realDonaldTrump ? Nothing!

3265 2018-06-04 17:12:49 Loved Skys coverage about Sane being left out, magically the insanely compare him to Ozil pointing out Sane has more Goals and Assists, But instantly massaging over that Oil has double the goal scoring opportunities created. Biased to the Max from Sky

3267 2018-06-04 17:12:38 I do eyelash extensions, & if you are a makeup lover, it would be best if you use oil free makeup, & oil free makeup remover. You have to make sure you clean them properly or they will not last as long as they should, & they could also lead to an infection.

3285 2018-06-04 17:09:48 She's right. Cruz & Cornyn do not listen or talk to us. They have their tight backers. Kochs, Russia, Mercers, Oil money from corps., etc.
They are bought & paid for. Corrupt to the very core of their being. They will not help Merkley or anybody else. They are stooges for Kochs.
3286 2018-06-04 17:09:48 And manufacturer can be sued for making a faulty product. That's common sense. Punishing a manufacturer for how a customer uses their product does not. I didn't see anyone trying to sue pressure cooker companies after the Boston Marathon terrorist bombing. Did you?
3287 2018-06-04 17:09:47 You can't purchase machine guns made after 1986. Since Heller federal courts have upheld state bans related to age and weapon type.

3298 2018-06-04 17:08:33 I saw a product a few years ago that made tailing ponds into hardened chunks that made removal “unspillable” and efficient. Agree that oil companies need to be more proactive in reducing.

Median 30d return any time is only +0.8% and positive 53% of the time.
But after these events? +4.8% and 77% of the time.

3395 2018-06-04 16:56:28 Yep, hemp oil/CBD is great stuff!  I use products from Miracle Nutritional for gout myself!
3396 2018-06-04 16:56:14 How many barrels of oil were spilled into sacred ground?
3397 2018-06-04 16:56:08 Ellos ya fueron cuando ya ganó una etapa y segundo en la penúltima etapa y fuero a la última etapa cuando ya era obvio q iba a quedar en el top 5... Pero un excelente special para ver d dond surgió
3398 2018-06-04 16:56:05 best thing of summer is you can get stuff done and TAN. Bathing suit and baby oil on ya while you wash your truck. Cutting the grass? Throw on a bikini top. Taking care of the animals? Best throw some tanning lotion on. And when you're done? Jump in the pool. This is the life.

3401 2018-06-04 16:55:51 From work to court to the doctors now getting a oil change 
3402 2018-06-04 16:55:45 Couple of thoughts on '77 rangers as I peruse their bbref page whilst awaiting an oil change- they were pretty good! Some high obp guys, solid rotation, could've made some noise in a wild card format. But 4 diff managers?? What's the backstory here?
3403 2018-06-04 16:55:44 Salt
Olive Oil
Baking soda?
3404 2018-06-04 16:55:39 Universal background checks and a gun registry only amount to gun grabbing in NRA propaganda.
3405 2018-06-04 16:55:34 One thing I don't like to do is getting my oil changed on my car. I mean it is free through my dealer but I really just want to go back to sleep 
3406 2018-06-04 16:55:11 @DrGundry is black seed oil ok on the PP?
3407 2018-06-04 16:55:10 Are you campaigning for UK to withdraw support for Scottish Oil and Gas industry?
3408 2018-06-04 16:55:07 Which means if you wrote "engine, oil and filter" or "engine, oil and filter" you get the same result, but there is no possibility of an Oxford comma mixup at all in your example without the first comma.
3409 2018-06-04 16:54:53 They are tire only but the same card can be used at express oil change etc. called CarCareOne. It’s high interest if you miss the 6 mo window but good if used right.
3410 2018-06-04 16:54:51 Finally got my oil change appointment set up. 5,000 miles later lol
3411 2018-06-04 16:54:45 Its unfortunate that her poop feels that way. Perhaps its really yellow ocre oil paint.
3412 2018-06-04 16:54:39 Political prisoners like Nehru got unlimited supply of books, paper and pen. He has access to his daughter Indira. Compare this with Andaman jail. One censored letter in a year to family. Work round the clock in oil grinding mill. It's a hell hole.
3413 2018-06-04 16:54:38 This is why renewables will inevitably win. Their price goes monotonically down, because you can't un-invent technology, so are a reliable bet for future prices. Commodities like oil on the other hand, we can't predict into the middle of the next week.
3414 2018-06-04 16:54:29 Imagine we couldn't be transporting Crude oil using truck to Mombasa Port.
3415 2018-06-04 16:54:16 Well I'm making roasted butternut soup . Cut it. Poured a bit of olive oil nyana, oreganum herb. Salt n pepper ... gonna scoop it out, put it the blender along side the seasoned onions and mushrooms ima fry manje. Then put fresh cream on top when I serve it ...
3416 2018-06-04 16:54:16 They were props from the Jurassic Park franchise.

The rest of the props are used to make oil.

3428 2018-06-04 16:52:56 AMLO full spectrum campaign has far right & left allies. This story picked the sins of everyone trying to stick them on him, but i love the part where it means Trump will regret dearly not seizing the opportunity to rip México of his natural resources besides oil, aided by Peña.

3436 2018-06-04 16:52:18 Gas prices fluctuate for ALL kinds of reasons. My spouse has been in the fuel business for 30 years. Experts like John Hofmeister have been predicting $5 a galllon gasoline since Obama was in office. We don’t buy oil from Iran FYI.We buy the largest amount from Canada then Saudis
3437 2018-06-04 16:52:14 The comma that would cost you would be between "engine" and "oil." The Oxford comma only appears as the comma after "and" in "engine, oil, and filter."
3438 2018-06-04 16:52:10 This is a funny article for all it's contortions. I.e., leaving out the oil & gas tax increase, and neglecting the fact that Oklahoma's raise was far larger than West Virginia's. Do you ever think that just telling the whole story might be better for your readers?
3439 2018-06-04 16:52:07 So do I and will continue to eat them.  Also Olive oil which is consumed by vegans everywhere is on par with beef and worse than pork.  The biggest difference is that supplying water for an animal is static for food or in nature.  Plants are way worse when used for food.
3440 2018-06-04 16:51:24 I just use regular ground up coffee beans, really any brand that doesn’t have a flavor and then store brand olive oil

3444 2018-06-04 16:50:54 I have long harbored a conspiracy theory that GPS tech is developed by Big Oil in order to make us drive more miles on "faster routes" and consequently burn/buy more gas. I have zero proof but it feels legit.
3445 2018-06-04 16:50:41 We need to see that Green Bar (i.e. Solar) replacing Oil’ position in this scenario.
3446 2018-06-04 16:50:36 @KaraStockton @TheShannonBurke   CBD oil (from HEMP only is available in every state & 7-11- no THC) is what Kara refers too.  The actual CBD oil, from actual cannabis, is the actual medical cure product.  That includes THC.  And the state legalities.  The 17 yr old got cannabis.

3449 2018-06-04 16:50:23 So I was cooking some fried chicken and the oil hit my eye. Why does everything I love hurt me..? :'(
3450 2018-06-04 16:50:12 You need to STFU and let canadian industry thrive, Canadian industry is more ethical and cleaner than most other oil and gas producing regions of the world.  Your stupidity is actually doing more harm than good to the environment.
3451 2018-06-04 16:50:01 In an Adam Smith “why is a diamond worth more than water” kind of way, this makes sense.

But consider desal water: $2,300 for ~326,000 gallons. How much would 326,000 gallons of oil cost at today’s per barrel prices? About $500,000.
3452 2018-06-04 16:49:57 Thanks for the shutout on the @HalftimeReport, @jimcramer ! We are still looking for crude oil to struggle. #wti #oil #futures #commodities
3453 2018-06-04 16:49:55 That makes no sense. Vehicles are a privilege, not a right. You cannot police a sale of an item constitutionally protected as a right. That converts it to a privilege and SCOTUS has already ruled (repeatedly) that converting a right to a privilege is unconstitutional. Next.
3454 2018-06-04 16:49:47 You might recall I fussed over an article from them about $100 oil when WTI was (at my target of) 72

3463 2018-06-04 16:48:35 The Iran deal was about Oil! Not nukes! Price of oil under Obama reached $5 remember? At least here in California.  Trump is doing excellent things for American! Problem is Liberal hate to to stong and you guys seem to blinded by it.  Look at the good and be positive

3465 2018-06-04 16:48:33 Venezuela had a successful socialism-based government and everyone loved Chavez. The ONLY reason why it failed was because they only had 1 revenue stream which was oil. Since they got big oil bucks they could have socialism. He dies, price of oil tanks, new leader is dictatorial.

3480 2018-06-04 16:46:41 so stupid. INvest in the future, not the past. Oil and gas are destroying our planet. Take the long view.

3489 2018-06-04 16:46:05 You think? Diversified economy is where growth has come, not in oil sector.
3490 2018-06-04 16:46:02 At the risk of explaining my joke, here are the three possible constructions:
"Replace the engine oil and filter."
"Replace the engine, oil and filter."
"Replace the engine, oil, and filter."

The last two have the same effective result, but only the last one is Oxford.
3491 2018-06-04 16:45:57 I'm only asking this as I wrecked my first ever car because I didn't. Have you checked the oil?
3492 2018-06-04 16:45:47 I’ve been one who went over 100,000 miles with no oil change before, so it was definitely a change for me  Probably why that car blew fire at @The_Male_Barbie 
3493 2018-06-04 16:45:46 Do you get a bulk discount on team EKGs? My dog had an exam and EKG in upstate NY that cost $350. That was with a vet cardiologist, though. (She cleared her for surgery and recommended salmon oil, because everything comes back to Alaska.)
3494 2018-06-04 16:45:38 But you right only people who go there go for oil or to hide from the police
3495 2018-06-04 16:45:29 Marathassa is a bulk cargo carrier, not an oil tanker.  There are over 3,000 of these visiting Vancouver every year.  But somehow the bulk carriers get a pass while the tankers, which have a perfect record, are the culprits.

No agenda here folks, move along.

3503 2018-06-04 16:44:19 If you ain't oil and gas, you will get stung. IMHO.
3504 2018-06-04 16:44:10 2 to 3 hour wait to get an oil change?! Brb while I learn to do this myself.
3505 2018-06-04 16:44:06 Idk But when ya suck all the oil and water out a motor it blows up Just a thought
3506 2018-06-04 16:44:06 Is it's independent of mass why didn't Clark use telekinesis to hold up the bars he was standing on?
I'll tell you why, he flies by creating a localized antigravity pool, emphasis on localized and the oil rig scene is a display of his 'unbreakability/super-strength', not flight.

3508 2018-06-04 16:43:58 @BootsUK there seems to be a lot more incidents of staff deciding they get to ask loudly about my medical diagnosis/symptoms in stores. Not pharmacists. Shop staff.

3509 2018-06-04 16:43:36 @RonWyden   Ron...,OIL prices just keep falling..can you find another remote area and stand in front of a gas pump again and complain about 3.00 gas?
3510 2018-06-04 16:43:32 We have to protect the European market which Merkel isn't doing. There is more at stake than just Sharia law. There's Russia trying to push the U.S. out of the oil markets with the climate change hoax and Merkel allowing it.

3516 2018-06-04 16:43:09 @jimcramer u said u buy OIL as long as its not locked into the SHALE PERMIAN (but why), Isn't that where it's hot in PERMIAN but also a lot of competition and the cost associated with trying to keep up with conventional oil or heavy swings in company base Permian Companies

3520 2018-06-04 16:42:14 "Oh man, just wait, pretty soon water is going to be more valuable than oil..."

I hear this sentiment all the time.

Anyone aware of an economic analysis that has explored this dystopian future everyone promises me is coming? What kinds of shifts would make this more plausible?
3521 2018-06-04 16:41:58 @elonmusk don't give up, the oil magnates want failure they and media want to secure the polluted earth can't survive without fossil fuel, never give up never

3526 2018-06-04 16:41:40 Lol fam.. Oil is present in numerous unexplored sites in the niger delta..Wikipedia be dropping shit. The world is gradually shifting from fossil fuel to renewable energy and Nigeria shouldn't fall behind on this.. Oil will remain but we should look towards other means of energy
3527 2018-06-04 16:41:33 Got oil on my shoes, lost my favorite pair of shorts & rooms a mess & im about to lose my mind

3534 2018-06-04 16:40:42 If a Chevy dealer knowingly sold a car to an intoxicated person who killed someone by driving drunk they should be held accountable for creating a public danger. Given gun makers & dealers sell weapons designed to kill they should have a similar legal obligation to police sales.
3535 2018-06-04 16:40:34 Gas prices are going up because Trump supports the oil industry instead of alternate energy.  Trump undid Obama's  requirement for automobiles to  give at least 54.5 miles to a gall by 2025.
3536 2018-06-04 16:40:31 Marinol was NOT effective for me, it made me feel a little spacey and thats it, it did not help with appetite or pain, even at a maxed out dose, 
I found the effects to be too unreliable . 
I now use a high grade THC oil from dispensary in NY, works really well.
3537 2018-06-04 16:40:29 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
3538 2018-06-04 16:40:19 I’ve waxed furniture, dark will antique, neutral will just protect. Truthfully, wax can get icky after a while in a bathroom (because of humidity) The oil protects &   you just reapply yearly.
3539 2018-06-04 16:40:14 Yeah they also really wanted us to become the top oil producing Nation.

3544 2018-06-04 16:39:50 Awesome Event thanks for the heads up. Will need to go on week long massive oil raids all week to hope to get any of these even at discounted prices.
3545 2018-06-04 16:39:10 @DocSupport_KJ I have plaque psoriasis and I’ve gotten it mostly under control but t tends to flare up depending on the season. Any advice on how to possibly help? I take tumeric and I use tea tree oil.
3546 2018-06-04 16:39:01 i cooked myself some food and my hands are now suffering. i hate oil
3547 2018-06-04 16:38:58 If I may ask a question, if truffles are so prized, why is using truffle oil so frowned upon in most competitions?
3548 2018-06-04 16:38:48 I did this.  The company called back and said that their palm oil was from plantations in Australia and no chimpanzees were harmed. I said orangutans. Not sure where they got chimps. Still, won't buy their product.

3552 2018-06-04 16:38:18 JJ and I woke up with a runny nose, caugh and the blahs. So i took a bath witg him and added ecuolipstis oil, made lemon toddies, and we took a nap at 10. Still feel off but not as bad.  Hopefully this will pass soon. Its too hot outside to feel sick

3558 2018-06-04 16:37:37 Bam Aquino’s failed logic:

“Suspend Train because he cannot control the surge in global petrol/oil prices.”

He clearly does not understand that the people at the lower income  bracket will suffer more because TRAIN is already a safety net for the poor.

3573 2018-06-04 16:35:31 When ever I go get an oil change they’re always telling me about something else then what I came in for and I just nod and smile and say ‘okay great thanks, I’ll have my dad take a look at it’ 
3574 2018-06-04 16:35:26 It helps with the dryness. Good way to help is to put about 3 drops lavender in 2 teaspoons (10 MLS) sweet almond oil 
3575 2018-06-04 16:35:25 Agreed. Forecasting recessions more than one quarter ahead is near impossible with conventional models. Only way to predict a recession is to anticipate a scenario not currently expected by markets (e. g. bubble burst, election outcome, oil price shock).

3577 2018-06-04 16:35:11 I accidentally sat on my already dwindling bottle of hair oil and I'm down to about 1/10 of the bottle now. The annoying thing is that I bought it in the UK and it's not sold here. NO OTHER HAIR OIL IS AS PURE AND VISCOUS?????

3579 2018-06-04 16:34:58 Skip "Marinol" (created by Big Pharma) and go directly to a medicinal marijuana dispensary (if available in your state). For my mom, RSO (THC/CBD oil) taken via suppository 1/day was a miracle for pain, sleep, and appetite and allowed her to stop all opiates.

3581 2018-06-04 16:34:50 Anyway so I was making pasta and I put a little bit of olive oil and then I poured the sauce in and the whole pan caught on fire and it was flaming for at least 25 seconds

3584 2018-06-04 16:34:31 We have alot of history with Israel and the Jewish people. It’s an amazing study if you have the time. Saudi is oil and money and that didn’t just happen when Trump arrived. We worked there for 4 years and it was totally different than I had been led to believe.
3585 2018-06-04 16:34:30 HEY WHATS UP WITH MY ONLY OIL OVER THERE
3586 2018-06-04 16:34:14 Vit E =  also Apricot oil. Cheap aswell. 
Yeah if its really dry (winter) mixing it with your moisturiser is soooo good.
3587 2018-06-04 16:34:13 Moreover Algeria is oil rich and overall because of their location the country of the Mediterranean have stronger ties with Europe and it might be related or not but the governance in these countries were far better then those in Sub-Sahara...maybe the Cfa is less the problem

3593 2018-06-04 16:33:28 I usually sip on a "mock" Korean Spicy Beef Soup. Basically, Beef broth with a dash of Mongolian Fire Oil n some thin sliced bits of green onion if I have it. If I don't, the boullion/broth n fire oil work.
I think If I was eating fish fingers n dicks, I'd toss'em sick or not.

3614 2018-06-04 16:30:49 it's just adding egg and oil (and you already admitted that oil was good) in a very spreadable format. the egg only intensifies the golden-brown goodness. think of it like an eggwash for your grilled cheese. (also, zero mayo taste unless you put it inside too which is also good)
3615 2018-06-04 16:30:41 Russia has excess reserves, which the western countries keep trying to prevent from reaching markets through oil sanctions. India can benefit from such a situation. No, Russian supply to India will not displace any demand. Why should Arabs benefit at the cost of our citizens?

3618 2018-06-04 16:30:33 The public should have been allowed to buy royalties on mineral rights, making the oil industry public investment that way we have more stake in the crude oil keeping more money in our pockets rather than a lion share to the foreign oil company.

3623 2018-06-04 16:29:35 So we have established that the laws have nothing to do with it. Thanks for making my point
3624 2018-06-04 16:29:18 I think there was miscommunication between us then. I assumed you were talking about the actual mining. On transportation, my question is to the gov. Why not just build a refinery and refine our own oil.
3625 2018-06-04 16:29:06 the real question is why are the finessing you $100 for a oil change...?
3626 2018-06-04 16:28:54 @POTUS gave my rich friends tax cut, Trumpcare raised premiums, caused oil to sky rocket, the Iran Disaster, higher inflation, increased the National Debt, started trade wars, and last, but not least, failed in Syria and caused instability in the Middle East. #TrumpFail

3632 2018-06-04 16:28:25 I was looking at some oils for oil cleaner, and it's like "works well on skin, or in cooking". And yeah, honey, baking soda, avocado, herbs, apple cider vinegar ...

3646 2018-06-04 16:27:00 Correct. House Rule. 

But the BP Oil Money does not usually go toward the general appropriation fund. I’m not saying it is or it isn’t, but the Speaker could make that case if he wanted the leverage.
3647 2018-06-04 16:26:58 @realDonaldTrump Hey, moron "Deal Maker"...how bout making a better deal for oil from your Arab "buddies". That would help Americans!
3648 2018-06-04 16:26:54 seriously this is as retarded as banning preventative maintenance--"you're not allowed to take your car in for an oil change until it breaks down first"
3649 2018-06-04 16:26:54 Had to get an oil change today and found that three of my tires need replacing grateful for the time and means to take care of it. Much better now than on the side of the interstate

3653 2018-06-04 16:26:33 It’s not how much you have but how you utilize it. Some countries have more oil and they are worse of. Just think if we can built roads cheaper coz we have cheaper bitumen or more stable/predictable foreign exchange rates....

3656 2018-06-04 16:26:28 @SKYANALERARI I’m looking at your skin care routine. Would it be better to make my own coffee bean & olive oil mask? Or would one that’s already made work?

3677 2018-06-04 16:24:16 That's a starch clump! Not pretty, but harmless. They're a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. These starches over time collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but unfortunately missed this one. Sorry!

Trickle down doesn't work so we put our money to use and grow our economies. But keep selling your snake oil.

3796 2018-06-04 16:10:40 Feasibility on the mode of transportation of oil and the actual mining/further exploration of the oil are two different things. My points are on the mining.
3797 2018-06-04 16:10:38 I dreamt that Voldemort was real & I had to warn all my fellow muggles that he had come back to kill us. he had closed all the drains so that no one could shower without drowning. also, I met someone named Ylang Ylang like the essential oil. quality dream, if I do say so myself.

3799 2018-06-04 16:10:26 I’m trying to get back to cooking with coconut oil but struggling because I hate the flavor of coconut. And now my fish and veggies and every single thing is over seasoned so that I can’t taste coconut. Help

3803 2018-06-04 16:10:18 Did we warn you that water was being privatized via Nestle, etc? You know you're onto a real story when a national newspaper in Australia bothers make fun of you for investigating it. Water is indeed the new oil.

3806 2018-06-04 16:10:14 Listening to Mark Zandi of @economics_ma ... he says economy should be gangbusters next 12 to 18 mos. There are concerns, oil prices, trade, but he doesn't expect those to derail economy.

3808 2018-06-04 16:09:58 Oh I think the Christian bakers would roll out the bible and say they are Christian but  are anything but... oil and water, doesn't compute.. they will always find a way of making a song and dance, over someone else's happy day song and dance.

3824 2018-06-04 16:08:56 Didn't I tell you maybe 3 days ago that it's not feasible transporting the crude using trucks. I am not exactly a layman when it comes to oil and gas but I am no expert either. But now the two articles that I tagged you in provided you the expert analysis you needed.

3892 2018-06-04 16:01:29 If a product contains palm oil, don't buy it. Send a tweet or email to the company stating that you won't buy their product because of the palm oil.

3931 2018-06-04 15:58:04 So don't you see how Canadian oil is sustainable too? High wages+ tough enviro regs + the pipeline ROW is returned to natural state. You prefer Saudi oil? Or American? Their regs are nowhere as vigorous.
3932 2018-06-04 15:57:59 Look what's happening there most of chicken and cooking oil they use there it is exported from Johannesburg and Richard Bay all minerals they have benefits about twenty families out of millions citizens in the whole country.
3933 2018-06-04 15:57:58 2) However, with the current moron and his minions in DC, going into the 20th century, much less the 21st, with environmental efficiency, is probably a big "NO". Besides, big oil likes diesel use and like the NRA - screw the kids

3947 2018-06-04 15:56:37 No they won't double because, Russia and Saudi Arabia by next two week at OPEC meeting are going to discuss how not allow the prices of oil to rise unprecedented

3988 2018-06-04 15:52:21 The CIA has a history of destabilising governments that it did not like and in many cases because those countries nationalized oil companies beginning in Iran in 1953 with democratically elected PM Mossadegh because he nationalized BP
3989 2018-06-04 15:51:55 You can’t tell me #TrumpRussia broke the Iran Nuclear deal was really to help #Putinomics & the #Saudi raise the price of a barrel of oil! Why isn’t @maddow or @chrislhayes @Lawrence talking about the real possibility this is the case #VoteThemOut

4083 2018-06-04 15:42:54 @WorldOfStu @glennbeck "Fried" doesn't necessarily mean bad, and calories are not necessarily what makes us Fat!  If you breaded the chicken with coconut or almond flour and fried in Avocado or Coconut oil,  the 'fried chicken' would actually be healthy for you!
4084 2018-06-04 15:42:54 I'm not at all boggled. I used to consult to small businesses. It's not the cost; it's the need to learn the technology, however simple. Compare it to learning how to do an oil change; how much do you "save" by doing it yourself compared to the learning-time?

4117 2018-06-04 15:40:52 Oh please, Donna..price of oil goes up & down all the time..Dems never want to lower taxes they only want to increase spending, which means higher taxes..the problem is along with higher taxes are higher prices for cars, homes, insurance, groceries...lower taxes are a good thing.

4140 2018-06-04 15:38:59 the taxpayer has never recouped the billion the Hibernia project cost, because the they continually subsidized big oil to the level almost equal to royalty revenue so it was a no cost to big oil and big expense to taxpayer

4163 2018-06-04 15:36:55 Wish people would understand the sensitivity of situation and vulnerability of a state like J&K. Terribly to keep pouring oil into fire..
4164 2018-06-04 15:36:45 Watch Saudi Arabia closely.  Serious reforms are coming and Trump is forging a new partnership with the younger, moderate rulers.  It could change things drastically in the Middle-East.  The days of oil are numbered and they have no choice but to modernize.
4165 2018-06-04 15:36:44 "Superman doesn't care about civilians". He might've missed that part where he saved the oil rig, took the bus outta the river, saved the helicopter pilot.
Oh and maybe that one bit where he kills the last surviving member of his race in order to save a civilian family
4166 2018-06-04 15:36:40 Blessing in Disguise: If US fails to mediate in the Gulf Crisis between GCC & Qatar, then crude oil price might see a sharp decline as Iran & Russia may not choose to curb their outputs as their economic dependency has already gone up since US led Intl sanctions.

4174 2018-06-04 15:35:57 I used olive oil, but next time.

4180 2018-06-04 15:35:40 But what we forget is that cleansing the skin strips it of essential oils that need to sit in the sebaceous gland to stop bacteria growing ... the spot! Avoid this by using our proven NHS Sunflower oil skincare - it works on all skin types. #NHS #skincareroutine

4210 2018-06-04 15:32:00 this is a metric that's different for everyone, and it depends on how  much oil you produce. my hair would dry out and get brittle if I  showered it every day, but every other day works wonders

your hair, then, is different than mine and requires daily attention

4212 2018-06-04 15:31:36 My source is everyone is my family getting burnt to a crisp because they kept reapplying everything 30-45 minutes?? It literally bubbled their skin because the oil was boiling on them. You’re supposed to reapply but I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about applying too often.

4221 2018-06-04 15:30:48 Be careful China, in the US we thought we had a great deal for oil from Saudi Arabia but two wars, several buildings, and trillions of dollars later we are still paying for it.

4273 2018-06-04 15:26:27 Untrue. Economy is well past 2014 levels. Oil prices way below 2014 levels but govt has no control of oil prices
4274 2018-06-04 15:26:24 High oil prices are more likely to trigger a financial crisis. If clean fuels replace dirty fuels the economy doesn't actually change, it just shifts from loser to winner. the entire fossil fuel biz could go under without issue as long as it's replaced

4299 2018-06-04 15:24:16 Only in Canada would they figure a massive development of tar sands with incalculable increase in emissions will meet the world wide emissions targets. In the meantime, oil companies will make $billions until someone figures the truth.

4347 2018-06-04 15:19:54 My opinion on the two party system that we are dealing with today is this: pretend you are in an airplane...the Democrat airplane is in a nose-dive straight to the ground, the Republican party plane is on a slower more agonizing descent. Corker and company represent this well.

4352 2018-06-04 15:18:39 I woke up and immediately hated my existence. My mom called and told me I had to take my car to the shop and get the oil changed, I told her no multiple times, I couldn’t. Now I’m just lying here staring at my phone, I can’t even get up to look at myself.
4353 2018-06-04 15:18:30 Know what else does great for poison ivy? Time. If anything, they just diluted the urushiol oil from the poison ivy on your skin. Plus essential oils can irritate your skin themselves making the ivy rash worse.
4354 2018-06-04 15:18:27 they get crispier faster when fried with oil, fight me

4365 2018-06-04 15:17:31 There's cashew cheeses, oil based cheeses, seitan and soy for meat replacement and it doesn't taste like plants at all!
4366 2018-06-04 15:17:29 Silicon Valley and Hollywood (Silliwood?) vs Big Oil = how is this even a question?
4367 2018-06-04 15:17:20 The kind I have is called "Spot On Treadmill Belt Lubricant" it comes in a clear bottle with a green label. I got it on Amazon. It is 100% silicone oil.

4372 2018-06-04 15:16:57 Oh really? Nothing wrong? Which lie that you have told are you lying about this time? Snake oil salesman eventually get caught and called out for the lying slimes that they are and that includes you.
4373 2018-06-04 15:16:45 The guy at the oil change place seriously just asked me if I wanted a Capri sun ...

4382 2018-06-04 15:15:56 Will they all rally against the US pipelines? Then the oil tankers from Saudi and Venezuela? Then the rail cars? Probably not...protest the only country with the toughest regs. I wonder why....?
4383 2018-06-04 15:15:56 You missed the point Rick Of course any tax break is helpful my point was Trump getting away from clean oil Now means opec can now start raising oil prices and just like that my tax break goes to billionaire oil CEO
4384 2018-06-04 15:15:47 Canadian is Waiting for G7. If G7 good cad $$$ good too + oil up then my BMO makes $$$$$$.
4385 2018-06-04 15:15:29 The Marshals were brilliant. Dealing with that major oil spill with the minimum of fuss and allowing the racing to continue as though nothing had happened. Top people. Thank you. 
4386 2018-06-04 15:15:21 So @AmericanAir, and other airlines, added fees galore when oil prices went up years ago. Oil prices went down, but fees never disappeared. Now, oil prices are going up, but not to the levels previously seen, and we're being warned that American might raise prices.  Amazing.

4389 2018-06-04 15:15:11 Also worth a note that the refineries in Washington (who purchase oil sands crude) will face increased competition from Canadian refined products as a result of the construction of this pipeline. They were the back up supplier when AB threatened Bill 12 action.

4398 2018-06-04 15:14:35 Oil is a curse and a blessing at the same time, giving 'Turkana' community a raw deal and blinding them with a shoot to kill order is just too bad. Sometimes the dog bites the owner, Turkanas might turn their anger on the authorities. Don't forget why/what they fight for/against.
4399 2018-06-04 15:14:30 @sainsburys  Iceland has promised to remove Palm oil from their own brand products because at present there is no guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction.Sainsburys cannot guarantee 100% palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction.
4400 2018-06-04 15:14:08 From a macro pov:

- NPA resolution making decent progress
- Oil prices stable for now

- rural wage growth has been poor (3% nominal)
- farm waivers as multiple elections in next 1 year

4417 2018-06-04 15:12:25 I agree, what has happened to monopoly laws. They seem to go to the highest bidder. They need to break up, just like they did to Standard Oil. But then stupid enough to allow them to merge back. Thick as thieves!!!'

4437 2018-06-04 15:10:17 @TorontoStar Canada has the ability to be an entirely self-sufficient, self-contained Country. We have no real need of imports. What if we were to cut off oil and gas exports to the U.S.? Canada could revert complete to an isolationist policy.

4461 2018-06-04 15:07:45 Only a very stupid man would argue that sending dirty oil west to Vancouver would have any impact on Eastern Canada importing oil.

It’s not about your supposedly safe pipeline to the west coast, it’s your plan to put it in an oil tanker and sail it through Metro Vancouver!

4523 2018-06-04 15:02:45 It’s no conspiracy theory that the CIA initiated and orchestrated the ouster of Mosaddegh in 1953.

4611 2018-06-04 14:54:18 Yes, all true...and there are many advantages to being unknown (esp. in a neoliberal late capitalist globalized world)...but if an oil-#economy wants to move into #tourism to diversify, then I guess it needs to become more known...

4613 2018-06-04 14:53:59 Yes!  We'll avoid cross contamination on the oil for the first few veggie burgers and fries, then the mozz sticks will get in there, and then around 3 - 5pm, if there's anything with meat that wants to take advantage of the deep fryer, it's allowed.
4614 2018-06-04 14:53:48 Don't assume that if "premier" Doug Ford drops the gas tax by 10 cents per litre, that the oil companies will drop the retail price by ten cents. I think there would only be a one cent drop with the other nine cents going to the oil companies' profits. #onpoli

4619 2018-06-04 14:52:55 The unrest in Venezuela is causing the oil prices to raise. In a few weeks prices will go back down. Trump called the  Sadie’s and OPEC is increasing production.

"I think our cooperation will increase, including with the signing of the declaration
4627 2018-06-04 14:51:39 The US has been used by the globalists to destroy Venezuela. They want their oil, their minerals, to protect the petrodollar, to introduce central banking Rothschilds debt slavery, and kill them with drugs. Nothing to do with socialism.

4632 2018-06-04 14:51:14 Uhhh cruelty free foundation that’s good coverage, oil free and $20 or less? Any tea on chichi?
4633 2018-06-04 14:50:55 I’d suggest the answer lays within the coffers of many politicians. Oil companies are making record profits and in profit driven businesses where return on investment is key those companies think more short term than long term unfortunately.

4656 2018-06-04 14:48:30 Great point. When Dubya took office, hardly anybody knew anything about oil or had any of those players on the radar or had even heard of "peak oil" or had ever heard the phrase "energy transition." Very different time.
4657 2018-06-04 14:48:23 People know me so well. I told my friend I had to drive to Fayetteville Co. today and the first thing he said was “when’s the last time you had an oil change?”

4663 2018-06-04 14:48:01 It's maddening that the one thing people are focusing on Pruitt about is his spending habits. Not the fact that he's selling us out to big oil and destroying the environment.
4664 2018-06-04 14:48:00 Like you did for Alberta’s oil industry? Take a hike.
4665 2018-06-04 14:47:57 Coconut oil removes it?! 
4666 2018-06-04 14:47:56 I‘m sure it has nothing to do with the history of colonialism, countries intervening in the Middle East, the Cold War, arming dictators, installing regimes, supporting different rebell groups, selling weapons, fighting for oil and profiting from war. I‘m almost absolutely sure.
4667 2018-06-04 14:47:56 If we were able 2 stop losing money in trades and get our money back to where we could help them that would be cool and maybe by proxy by using our own oil we wouldn't have to go through the trading.

 - Destroying women's health care..

4683 2018-06-04 14:46:36 @JustinTrudeau I'm appalled at your  lack of insight on long-term ramifications of backing oil instead of turning that $4.5B into development of renewables, but I'm proud of the stand you've taken against #DontheCon. We CAN differ on issues & that is why I'm a #ProudCanadian.

4777 2018-06-04 14:32:46 I've just realized that 25% of spanish diet is olive oil, which is fat too :) That's why spanish fat and sugar consumption is so important

4786 2018-06-04 14:31:10 @JustinTrudeau has like his dad decided the Canadian taxpayer has to get into the oil business. Ignoring the need to wean ourselves from fossil fuel. And has just guaranteed the CPC's Andrew Scheer will be next PM #cdnpoli
4787 2018-06-04 14:31:00 Are you looking to get an oil change near Richmond or Lexington, KY? If so, we encourage you to visit us at Jack Burford Chevy, and we’ll get you in, out, and back on the road in a hurry.

4797 2018-06-04 14:29:35 Didn't have siblings/cousins (or a dad really) but had Mum, that house & pets. Was always envious of friends who lived in smaller houses with big families (who didn't get bullied for living in a big house! Course, the bullies didn't know we couldn't afford oil to heat it! )

4810 2018-06-04 14:28:15 Again if the tax money that is currently being put into fossil fuels was put into renewables we would be just fine. With jobs. The federal gov't is in the pocket of the big oil companies. We need to get off fossil fuels because if we don't none of this will matter.

4812 2018-06-04 14:27:52 @jimiuorio what's the next level for oil?
4813 2018-06-04 14:27:51 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4814 2018-06-04 14:27:50 US GDP growth was 2.9% in Q4 vs. Canada (boosted by Alberta/oil price recovery) at 1.7%. Ontario was at 0.6%. Given the increase in carbon taxes, cap and trade, hydro costs, and now NDP wanting to increase benefit costs, I wouldn't be surprised to see more businesses head south.
4815 2018-06-04 14:27:48 Run coconut oil directly onto your nail beds daily. It's a miracle worker.

4817 2018-06-04 14:27:40 Oil is too much.
4818 2018-06-04 14:27:36 Canada has the oil but we also have bad politice Caving to enviro-nutjobs is wrong.
4819 2018-06-04 14:27:34 Oil keeps heading down here.  Addinf some puts here.  $XOM added small 82p.  Watching $WLL, $COP, $MPC, $DVN. And $CRC.

4821 2018-06-04 14:27:25 A little Lavender oil around the area but not on any open wound site. It should help a bit with pain.

4823 2018-06-04 14:27:17 Great marketing idea: baby coffin manufacturers should buy ads in all essential oil and anti-vax articles. Know your market.

4826 2018-06-04 14:27:03 Yet when the price of crude oil goes down the petrol prices never follows
4827 2018-06-04 14:27:03 You must be the most ill informed person in Canada. You do realize Ontario can never get out of debt without a $130 per barrel oil for a minimum of 17 years. All caused by Gerald Butts, McGuinty and Wynn. She is not only hated in Ont but also in Canada

4836 2018-06-04 14:26:09 Was there an urgent need to start the Export of oil rather than wait to set up own refinery in Turkana or even a near place like Eldoret
4837 2018-06-04 14:25:57 We're oil friends fam 
4838 2018-06-04 14:25:52 Stephen Harper's crew removed the hate speech provisions of the criminal code. New guy too busy subsidizing big oil to pop his head out of his arse to reinstate them.

4840 2018-06-04 14:25:45 Rub coconut oil directly onto your nail bed daily. Your nails will harden within a couple days.
4841 2018-06-04 14:25:41 The only front I’m winning on is the ‘pungent aroma of linseed oil’ front. Which IS a win because I could sniff that stuff all day long... and probably will. x

4843 2018-06-04 14:25:25 Would TransMountain purchase have been necessary if the Feds affirmed a strong, strategic narrative supporting ’s global energy leadership & upholding NEB approval for TMX rather than comments of shutting down the oil sands, climate jockeying in Paris & introducing C69?

4846 2018-06-04 14:25:10 Yesterday I #wrote a #chapter and it poured out of me like liquid gold. It felt like my best work. Today, the words dripped out like oil from a leaky engine. What do these two days have in common? I wrote, and two chapters got done. #amwritingfantasy #writingtips #writerslife

4849 2018-06-04 14:24:52 Baby oil. Let it sit for 15 min. Also try lemon juice or baking soda and water.
4850 2018-06-04 14:24:46 I'll tell you what, you run. We won't.
4851 2018-06-04 14:24:39 I like my 2017 Altima. It spacious and great on gas. It takes synthetic oil so you don’t have to get oil changes as often
4852 2018-06-04 14:24:22 JT to Derby as lamps first signing is close  #AgentTalk #CFC #Derby #Lampard #Terry
4853 2018-06-04 14:24:12 I disapprove of essential oil "treatment " but I don't think judgements can be made about neglect without autopsy results and stats of pharmaceutical risk/reward.  The knee jerk reaction that pharmacy drugs are cures is false. They also kill. As u know.
4854 2018-06-04 14:24:11 They’re just lil pockets of oil to keep your nipples moisturized!! Don’t pop them!
4855 2018-06-04 14:24:08 A man knows who his heart belongs to.

You can cook his food in diamond oil and do backflips but if it isn’t you, it isn’t you 
4856 2018-06-04 14:24:07 Ahahahahahaha honestly I have allergic reactions every week and get such dry skin. It’s in a good phase, but that normally only lasts like a few days and it’s back bad. It’s v problematic! But I use coconut oil and Johnson’s baby lotion

4868 2018-06-04 14:22:44 Only persisting problem I hear that’s near impossible to solve is the mysterious “WHY ISNT MY ROTARY CONSUMING OIL AND WHY DOES IT REEK OF OIL”.
4869 2018-06-04 14:22:43 And the price they get for our western Canada oil at the the world’s cheapest prices !! And they still complain and whine.
4870 2018-06-04 14:22:36 So, jojoba oil works really well as a face moisturizer.
4871 2018-06-04 14:22:26 Ha ha! Yeah, for some reason I still cannot pull up the site either. Weird.

4879 2018-06-04 14:21:05 Iran started this civil war arming Houthis with antiship missiles and scuds, threatening freedom of navigation of the Red Sea up to Suez. this was a deliberate power play to strangle flow of oil & shipping and threaten Saudi Arabia from south.

4902 2018-06-04 14:18:50 Unless it is a 'contributed' article to PNAS, wherein the contributor is an NAS member+participates in the design but need not do the research. They send it to 2 qualified reviewers they know. A science op-ed; pal reviewed. Crucial 'papers' on oil sands were published this way.
4903 2018-06-04 14:18:46 So for the abh I deff suggest using some type of oil with it because it’s kind of dry, and I apply it with a brush first then blend with a beauty blender and I do the contour first then the highlight after to clean up the dark places
4904 2018-06-04 14:18:41 #Trump believes our country should have the security of being independent of the world when it comes to Oil, Steel, Aluminum. I think he's right. He's always having to push against the establishment.

4931 2018-06-04 14:16:18 A Poem (somewhat dark)
Anxieties
rev in my head
spinning circles of doubts and fears
brakes gone
out
burning tread
in my brain
a crash
screeching tire
dense smoke
purifying flame
and
the black oil
of sleep
can make it
stop.

4948 2018-06-04 14:14:34 that just happens eventually when you use a sharpie on skin, dude. the skin secretes oils that protect the skin, but the oil will soak into the sharpie and kill it.

4955 2018-06-04 14:13:52 That's the right way to exfoliate . Try coconut oil for moisturisation, it works well for me.

4957 2018-06-04 14:13:44 Lower oil prices may also eventually ripple through the global market, some traders said. Other major oil exporters could be forced to lower prices to compete. Or if the U.S. builds out the capacity for more exports, it could unleash another wave of supply on the global market.

4962 2018-06-04 14:13:03 Hi , Yes they do a vegan option, which includes the following: Olives, Fire roasted tomatoes, Hummus, Vine leaves, Bread and dipping oil (if ok with plan oil!)
Sweet potato crisps
4963 2018-06-04 14:12:57 10/10 would recommend going vegan and oil free for clearing up skin instead as a first line option, instead of that super harsh medication
4964 2018-06-04 14:12:56 @Kwik_Fit I left my car at one of your shops at 9AM (with a previous appointment) for an MOT and change the oil filter. It hasn’t been ready till 2:50PM. Not very ‘kwik’, tbh.

4967 2018-06-04 14:12:48 OIL 1H false break above 20MA, does not hold above last 2 hours. Bearish engulfing candle printing now, signals lower to continue. Volatility still ON FULL, direction now kicks lower. WATCH DWT
4968 2018-06-04 14:12:43 That’s because they think education means indoctrination and compliance to ideology rather than research and critical thinking for one’s self.

5007 2018-06-04 14:08:29 Are the fracking people involved because of the rainbow sheen of oil pollution?
5008 2018-06-04 14:08:11 Hahahah, a guy I know got a local fine artist  a fortune to paint a massive oil painting of him and a girl he went out with for about two weeks.... omnicringe
5009 2018-06-04 14:08:11 The difference between U.S. and global oil prices reached its widest in more than three years last week, drawing comparisons to the market before Congress lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports in late 2015.
5010 2018-06-04 14:08:09 Would destroy some pasta covered in truffle oil right about now...
5011 2018-06-04 14:08:08 What Trump should have done was call the 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum a carbon tax instead of a tariff.  That would have really pickled Trudeau to explain why it is bad on coal fired steel but OK on oil.
5012 2018-06-04 14:08:08 Places like Venuzela aren't doing so good either......their main income is oil and illegal drugs...so they don't bother with growing food..and now they're starving....all because the US doesn't have a border...... Wonder who profits from that system ? BIG AG
5013 2018-06-04 14:08:02 Cajuput oil, hot instant noodles, a new book.
5014 2018-06-04 14:07:56 If that is the law there and they have the funds to do so, after passing the required BGC, so what? Or is it just jealousy that someone might have the funds to do that and you don’t?
5015 2018-06-04 14:07:53 Also, when a trend ends, the next move down will often be strong, so those with sufficient patience and willing to get stopped out a few times trying to catch that big move, well, being short even one Oil contract in 08 once it topped, would translate to about $100k at the trough
5016 2018-06-04 14:07:46 No, don't take it that way, I just meant I'd rather handle it with our wits than plucking chickens and heating oil. & I'm smart enough to know it was metaphor. But also wily enough to add another joke to it. No condescension intended. Truly.
5017 2018-06-04 14:07:22 As the global oil glut evaporats we are contending with ourown flood of supply, which could bode well for consumers but undermine a broader recovery in the energy sector.

5020 2018-06-04 14:06:54 First it’s  getting to  the gas then the oil - fracking demands both; extracting oil is the ultimate goal - resulting in methane emissions so this is the trifecta of fossil fuel madness . #WaterCrisis
5021 2018-06-04 14:06:53 sunscreen also makes my skin hypersensitive to sunlight and severe burns- so never touch the stuff.  Aloe  or balsam cream (shampoo or hair conditioner) can be  very ehlpful as  well as olive oil-- so theses are  my fixes
5022 2018-06-04 14:06:22 it's rather moronic and ironic it amazes me,  we're seeing the redo of 1973 of the Oil run before entering EU and now a brexit amergedden Conservative problems and election of Harold Wilson in October 1974
5023 2018-06-04 14:06:16 Data is Oil of 21st century....it seems Countries will soon be fighting to get as much as it can...but Data processing is a tough task...if used the processed data in a very smart manner, can answer a lot of woes humanity is facing today.

5027 2018-06-04 14:05:47 Trudeau Liberals support a carbon tax on oil that makes the commodity more expensive & according to Liberals less likely to be burned. A tariff on steel that is fired by coal, that Liberals also oppose, has similar effect. Yet the "war on coal" Trudeau Liberals see it differently
5028 2018-06-04 14:05:40 Always dangerous when a legacy "goes after" a low cost airline; they simply don't understand the operating model. This could be messy for some, especially with oil prices increasing.
5029 2018-06-04 14:05:38 I can't believe you HWY 181 by Karnes City & having roadwork done & you know people have to get to their oil field jobs are you really that ass backwards?

5038 2018-06-04 14:05:01 You could say the same for everything we do. Why pick on oil!
5039 2018-06-04 14:04:56 There were reports pre-draft that JP was a rural northern kid who was only just adjusting to big Finnish cities/ hockey. If Oil didn't know this could impact his mental/emotional development shame on them. Also, agree his set of tools are > than Laine. Stop blaming the player.
5040 2018-06-04 14:04:54 Stop this.   Trump’s tariff policy is moronic and should be opposed by anyone with a brain.
5041 2018-06-04 14:04:35 So there's oil as well as gas in the area . That's a bonus .

5046 2018-06-04 14:04:06 It's actually penne with cherry tomatoes, asparagus, and mortadella. No herbs in this one, but there is garlic, besides olive oil. Then a sprinkling of parmiggiano cheese.

5051 2018-06-04 14:03:37 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
5052 2018-06-04 14:03:37 “Coconut oil”
5053 2018-06-04 14:03:32 And you would be wrong again.  Check Indiana...they are polar opposite. They don't have to drive anywhere for lax laws.
5054 2018-06-04 14:03:14 EB still too obviously a con man, esp with the Bret stuff. Conrad does a great job but EB obviously not clued in on the fact there’s no need to try and sell snake oil in 2018.
5055 2018-06-04 14:03:11 You need to understand the market. Prices for oil/barrel are set on the international market not by USA. Hopefully as we continue developing our oil and gas resources & become major exporters, things may change.
5056 2018-06-04 14:02:54 I bet IPO wont happen from lack of investor interest. I think your oil 4casts R realistic. No shortage anywhere in the world. Renewables R here 2 stay as R EVs. Watch 4 changes in ship fuel from Bunker C.  Something no1 is watching. Subsidizes sweet production

5062 2018-06-04 14:02:28 So sunscreen is basically oil/lotion that absorbs into your skin but when you put it on too close together it can absorb into your skin because its already doing that with another layer so now there’s just a layer of oil on your skin!

5064 2018-06-04 14:02:19 Oil of Olay keeps it poppin'!
5065 2018-06-04 14:02:16 Use the oil YOLO!!
5066 2018-06-04 14:02:15 Oil sa7
5067 2018-06-04 14:02:09 Wait Crude oil scandle too
5068 2018-06-04 14:02:01 Never found a submarine in any estuary or Pembrokeshire I have yet seen  After oil UCW 1966 it took until 2010 to see an oil rig or gas rig under construction. We ran CBathT after School Geology Film Club evening  sessions Chris policeman after school Pa ambulance notwithstanding
5069 2018-06-04 14:01:56 A quote from @github's blog post about being acquired by @Microsoft, 'Open source and business, people said at the time, mixed as well as oil and water.' I am pretty sure people still say that quite a bit.
5070 2018-06-04 14:01:32 people who drive in Philadelphia:

where do you get your oil changed? i need to get mine done so bad
5071 2018-06-04 14:01:30 I love me some coconut oil 
5072 2018-06-04 14:01:17 @KetoConnect made the olive oil cake with Lily's chocolate chips, a cream cheese glaze and topped it with SF whip cream & berries. #heaven
5073 2018-06-04 14:01:12 In the minutes, some officials noted that if “oil prices remained high or moved higher, inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and pass-through of energy costs.”
5074 2018-06-04 14:01:08 Oil filter on me car changing cheers
5075 2018-06-04 14:01:05 Question: What type of grease/oil do you use for your wheel bearings? I have seen some recommend 20W oil (basically 3 in 1 oil); others seem to prefer lithium grease?
5076 2018-06-04 14:00:58 I think you need to do your research before you make assumptions since your are not a medical professional. Pure essential oil companies make it very clear that oils do not cure diseases. This child died because his mother discontinued his/her medications.

5078 2018-06-04 14:00:51 I'm going to restart my computer and see what happens. I'll be back in a sec. I'll also restart my phone and try from there.
5079 2018-06-04 14:00:50 Anointing oil sure pass some of these yeye and rogue companies 
5080 2018-06-04 14:00:49 Uncle you have oil money
No come here dey lie for us
Nobody will kidnap you
5081 2018-06-04 14:00:31 You are kidding, right?  A meetup in a Walmart parking lot is all it takes. We take more precautions selling used cars.
5082 2018-06-04 14:00:26 Try and dig out the original proposals for Hunterston site , then look at the size of the place and the potential expansion land today.

The importance was there , just like in the McCrone report about how iScotland was a doer - even without oil.
5083 2018-06-04 14:00:23 The message to sell seems simple to me. New pipeline = increased price of Canadian crude. Skim a fraction of that incremental revenue (direct or indirect) and put towards green investments. Win win. Without a new pipeline oil will move by rail w other problems.
5084 2018-06-04 14:00:07 What he said was true but it's not israel it's the muslims country who are breeding different terrorist groups on the name of islams.the money they are receiving from oil are investing in their destruction of their community and the world.
5085 2018-06-04 13:59:45 Gas is up, oil for heating is way up, food prices  up - gee the 30 cents we got from your big tax cut for the wealthy is helping a lot! YOU GOP MUST GO>
5086 2018-06-04 13:59:31 So productive today. 

Did a few minutes review, drop off my mom to the hospital for her checkup, brought car for emissions test, oil change and reinflate the tires. Now I'm home, but will head out to the library to print something.

5087 2018-06-04 13:59:22 Top in the potential conflict of interest controversy is that Martin Mbogo, who is Tullow Oil Kenya's country manager, and Ms MaryJane Mwangi, the acting chief executive officer of the National Oil Corporation of Kenya, are a couple living together. I smell snake oil somewhere.
5088 2018-06-04 13:59:20 It’s well past time from a decency standpoint. From a votes standpoint, Lamar, Corker, Diane Black, Marsha Blackburn would rather be boiled in oil than offend Trump voters.

5095 2018-06-04 13:58:17 I get Marky's point , but West Coast DOES already have history via container terminal , and as I mentioned earlier the original remit for Hunterston was for this as well.

Then there is that thing we darent talk about , Oil on the clyde using same terminal - plus a hub wind/tidal

5105 2018-06-04 13:57:25 I want to know why I am paying $3.00 at the pump when barrels of oil is only at $66!!!  Something is definitely off here.
5106 2018-06-04 13:57:10 Baking soda and coconut oil.  I will message you on FB. :)
5107 2018-06-04 13:57:00 Stop using Palm oil in your own brand products.
Give consumers the choice.
If Iceland can do this so can you.
5108 2018-06-04 13:56:44 What about corn subsidies...why do we need them with all the oil we have?
5109 2018-06-04 13:56:26 And this is the Government you want us to entrust our safety too? Sorry, but I will deal with my own safety.
5110 2018-06-04 13:56:26 Hon.Ahmed Arthur & suspended CEO of Metro Mass Transit, why do we still have branded buses with former President Mahama’s image in town. Are we shielding GHS 3.6Million oil revenue which was misappropriated. 
Take it down.

5112 2018-06-04 13:56:15 Did you mess with the ground at all? Try pulling up the ground rod and dumping used oil down the hole. Water would work too, pee if you’re in a pinch. Shove ground rod back in and see what happens

5124 2018-06-04 13:54:57 @FronteraRes share price in free fall, 6% knocked off today  what has gone wrong? no news to help stabilize, bolster the share price? UD2 blowing any gas? CO2? Why are the oil fields not actually producing any real quantities of Oil? Initial flows are not confirmed flow rates...

5129 2018-06-04 13:54:25 Oil prices are going up for good reasons.
5130 2018-06-04 13:54:17 I think I'm gonna apply baby oil all over my sexy dad bod just like Finn Balor and take video of it, I'm sure I'll get the same reaction.
5131 2018-06-04 13:54:15 Love the mindset but your body is like car every so often you need to take pit stop to get an oil change to preserve life otherwise it will breakdown from over use. Muscle are pulled from fatigue and overuse
5132 2018-06-04 13:54:13 Jesus H. Christ...can you not follow simple instructions?  Out of state vs in-state.  Lax law jurisdictions vs relatively stronger IL laws.   

And yes, Indy, Milwaukee and the other lax law areas have HIGHER per capita gun crime than Chicago.

5137 2018-06-04 13:53:42 I haven’t dyed my purple in awhile cause I’m letting it fade out but I’ve been using Argon Oil Pure Purple from Sally’s that I totally recommend, it’s already mixed no developer needed and comes out such a pretty purple and lasts a long time! 
5138 2018-06-04 13:53:41 Oh how wrong you are. I have personally heard essential snake oil salespeople tell loved ones to stop taking chemo, heart and blood pressure meds, to stop inhalers, to stop anti-rejection meds. Essential oils are nothing more than a pyramid scheme and worthless.
5139 2018-06-04 13:53:40 Apply some engine oil called suuru 
5140 2018-06-04 13:53:22 Murf, I’ll help!  I think he needs some oil rubbed on.  You know just to show off the muscles more.
5141 2018-06-04 13:53:09 Liberals - "we are investing" in TM. Seems the government of Venezuela 'owns' their oil industry as well. Last I checked oil companies there have pulled their assets on mass.
5142 2018-06-04 13:53:00 The reason for this is actually extremely simple. STL city is not part of STL county, unlike Chicago that has expanded to all of Cook Co. and then some. STL doesn't get to included other areas of the metro to water down its inner city crime statistics like Chicago.
5143 2018-06-04 13:52:24 Had to delete petrol tweet. Political twitter took an innocent memory and weaponized it.

5186 2018-06-04 13:48:07 It's generally not going to that, so much as trying to provide proper safety for those jobs rather than just assume it's okay because the person is a single man. Take ACLU and similar organizations' efforts to make pipe welding and oil field working jobs safer.

5346 2018-06-04 13:31:38 Saying the sausage and oil was PROBABLY the best bit is not the same as saying its healthy.  That said, it depends on the sausage and the oil.
5347 2018-06-04 13:31:00 The techs at my job be smoking squares while they have on gloves that still be having oil and all types of shit on em lmao just waiting for these niggas to go up in flames one of these days

5350 2018-06-04 13:30:43 Instead of suspending #TRAIN law, we should be creating good paying jobs, raising current wages, transition away from oil. We need to be energy independent! Lets make sure OPEC has 0 influence on our affairs.

5361 2018-06-04 13:29:18 I’m prbly gone be gone back to ATL by Wednesday . I was suppose to leave today but needed an oil change and some other shit
5362 2018-06-04 13:29:16 This guy has to go away!
5363 2018-06-04 13:28:51 That is what happened with oil. We knew shale was a solution since the 60s. But it required $50+ to be viable. You saw what happened. But, if we accept subsidized products we need tariffs or subsidies on our sides.
5364 2018-06-04 13:28:48 Not sure if it’s just me but the password doesn’t appear to be working, is yours working @CashErrthing ?

5367 2018-06-04 13:28:38 You mean my car needs oil.

Sounds fake. 

I’m hoping this is a simple car problem.

5371 2018-06-04 13:28:12 So they took the oil orally???
5372 2018-06-04 13:28:12 New site looks amazing! The news and chart features are really cool! Thanks Jimboman, you were quite busy over the weekend!
5373 2018-06-04 13:28:01 I really don't like brioche type breads. Croissants would be an occasional luxury. There is so much fat in them. Yet Italian focaccia is much the same yet healthier. Lashings of olive oil instead of butter.
5374 2018-06-04 13:27:58 Oil pulling is my favorite part of the morning 
5375 2018-06-04 13:27:57 Knobby is right though about butter and coconut oil ect. put in a blender it’s 75% of the way to a latte. If you’re into those. NTTAWWT

5380 2018-06-04 13:27:40 I get your point.  Not sure why you would have a pivot in 2005 (without speculating...millennials don't like manual labor...).  I am fairly certain it isn't oil, since oil has had two major spikes and crashes since 2005 that you don't see in the trend line.

The Planet is in dire straits, there is no more time for regime changes and oil wars from anyone.
5397 2018-06-04 13:25:47 In the Permian at the end of 2017, 2/3 of total oil production came from wells created in the prior 24 months. Impressive. #EIAConf

5402 2018-06-04 13:25:21 Used to think this, but it doesn't work this way. f you already can get your hands on an oil block, or the FAAC of a state, or opportunities in privatisations and other deals, why do the work of building when you may lose relevance as other centres of power and wealth develop?

5428 2018-06-04 13:21:49 I’m looking at making a chamomile soap but the essential oil is very expensive. 

Is it more important to you have a true essential oil and pay more ($9+ a bar) or use a natural fragrance oil blend with similar scent? ($6 a bar)

5435 2018-06-04 13:20:58 @moneylifers even #Brazil calls for 15% levies for oil/gas production in its borders to be invested as research expenditure within Brazil. Levies based on total sales. #CSR not unique
5436 2018-06-04 13:20:56 If enough of us vote for independence, there’s nothing WM can do to stop us. It’s only a treaty. Of course they only want us because of our resources including oil. What’s the chances of Wales gaining enough support for Indy?

5502 2018-06-04 13:12:55 Of course I'm right, Obama said as much himself.  Calling a person "gullible". "Republican Cower" & our President a "snake oil salesman" is simply identity politics. That is divisive - and if you cannot see that -you just hate people who disagree with you. What? do you stand for.
5503 2018-06-04 13:12:53 Why, in America (usually), do so many people hate the idea of abortion (basically killing a bunch of cells) but are so quick to praise their ‘war hero’s’ who kill innocent civilians in the quest for world dominance, oil and money.

5507 2018-06-04 13:12:30 Can't understand why the crude oil is marked for export. When I last checked we are importing crude oil and refining it at Mombasa. Can someone please make me understand the logic.
5508 2018-06-04 13:12:28 The idea that you could simply redesignate any tax (inheritance tax, corporation tax, oil and gas taxation?) as a local tax would be a massive loophole in the general reservation of fiscal powers, which by itself makes your interpretation implausible.

5552 2018-06-04 13:08:23 If you find yourself in CA, Amphora is the place to go. Otherwise, just find a shop that has high turnover and stores oil properly (cool, dark). Taste it. If the staff cannot tell you where it is from and when it was harvested, move on.

5567 2018-06-04 13:06:16 Yes. They are rich as a result of factors unrelated to EU membership or the lack thereof, namely oil (Norway) and very long term stability (Switzerland) amongst others. As a result the incentive to change the model (join the EU) to improve relative performance was less strong.

5635 2018-06-04 12:58:44 You suck up the progressive propaganda that has been skewed by tyrants and wanna be tyrants about gun control. Your argument is invalid. Insults don’t make your stance any more credible, just weaken it, if that’s even possible.

Has to do with a small amount of non-sugared artificial flavouring in water near end cycle

Now all the legal cannabis oil has artificial flavour

5645 2018-06-04 12:57:39 You said the crude oil is heated. That is wrong. The crude oil must be fully vaporized before entering the fractionating column not merely heated.

5682 2018-06-04 12:54:26 Do u blame Trump when the wind changes direction? The price of oil and gas is determined by global supply and demand. Depending on what state or town u reside, local politicians may add to price w/ a tax. I'm in Chicago, tax is approx 50 cents/gallon.
5683 2018-06-04 12:54:17 @narendramodi not reducing fuel price is a wonderful step in the long run. Instead of subsidizing oil prize, use that money to set up more power plants and bio fuels. This would create more employment in India and also saves environment and country!

5701 2018-06-04 12:52:38 Our reserves are low. 
The economies of scale and the prevailing international oil prices are the key barriers.  
A cost effective refinery will cost between 1bln-10bln USD and requires about 120,000 barrels a day to break even. This means we need all the oil...
5702 2018-06-04 12:52:37 No other oil producer is investing in emissions intensity reduction the way Canada is. PM is the only G7 leader actually doing anything about the problem, notwithstanding parochial voices in the media.

5716 2018-06-04 12:51:19 Not at all necessarily.

Our government & the oil industry for example. Government ensures the oil remains OUR natural resource & its profits feed back into the state (and thus to our people). This keeps the businesses in reins so they run with a high standard of safety & ethics.

Indianapolis has higher per-capita gun violence than Chicago.

5744 2018-06-04 12:47:28 I was in a quaint little junk shop and I found an old oil lamp. I started rubbing it to see what would happen. Nothing at first, but I had a feeling about it, so I rubbed and rubbed, really polishing it... and guess what?! I got offered a job cleaning all the lamps in the store!
5745 2018-06-04 12:47:25 I would agree that makes sense, though some argue different (either the fish boundary or measuring from the edge of the firth of Forth). Also interesting to consider the impact of Shetland staying out of an independent Scotland - who would get the West of Shetland oil.

5753 2018-06-04 12:46:36 Yet the most crime guns come from within state when you compare to any other state.
Also, why no rampant gun violence in the states where the guns come from?
Your points are irrelevant given criminals easily get guns within state at higher rate.

5912 2018-06-04 12:30:29 Also, I've asked before, is England going to stop buying Scotland's food, drink & oil? Not to mention the Scottish water they rely on. And if so, staying in the EU means a SM & CU with 500 million instead of only 53 million.

5915 2018-06-04 12:30:00 Fractional distillation is used to separate crude oil into simpler, more useful mixtures. This method can be used because different hydrocarbons have different boiling points.

5940 2018-06-04 12:27:11 Yes, communism is an economic system & failed to compete in both China & Russia.

Now, Russia & China are totalitarian regimes carrying out plans for world domination via Standard Oil style monopolistic competition, combined with military asset acquisition.

5975 2018-06-04 12:22:51 No, it's not a priority; otherwise Bush would have taken action back in 2002 when Chavez invited Cuba and Iran, then Russia in 2005. If U.S. stops importing oil from Venezuela it will cripple the regime but will hurt those already suffering more.

Where's the U.N. in all of this?
5976 2018-06-04 12:22:50 Isn't that what the oil companies want?

6024 2018-06-04 12:17:54 The question is did it benefit us? IMF/WB made PH addicted to loan—loans pegged in USD using cheap petro dollars—then when OPEC decided to reduce oil supply, we had a global oil crisis, Mexico defaulted, they raised the interest rate and a global recession ensued.

6041 2018-06-04 12:15:48 The 9th ward resources are more valuable, yes black people are valued but I'm talking about natural resources, oil companies had hoped blacks would just go away. They under estimated black people love for there home.
6042 2018-06-04 12:15:44 The UK government have dismantled oil rigs?
6043 2018-06-04 12:15:27 You know you’ve actually killed my friend @RoxBlackburn with your baby oil videos. There she was minding her own business when you suddenly oiled yourself up and she was left with no choice but to fangirl to death RIP Rox

6045 2018-06-04 12:15:12 Prove it. Explain why we are the only country in the world to find oil and get poorer, how is it a benefit to us that we get westminster govts we don't vote for? how is Brexit, something else we didn't vote for, a benefit to us when we know it will devastate the economy!? morons

6049 2018-06-04 12:14:46 @MorningsMaria the price of oil along with most commodity prices fluctuate everyday which affect consumers.

6051 2018-06-04 12:14:33 Have you tried coconut/olive oil instead of castor oil? In my experience castor oil is a bit too heavy and tangles my hair ALOT. Also sleeping with a silk bonnet does wonders for breakage and keeping curls fresh enough until your next wash day 
6052 2018-06-04 12:14:15 @sdosemagen The work that has been done during the oil spill, surfaced the issue that there was a failure in the governance system that was supposed to protect people  #ecsa2018

6068 2018-06-04 12:12:25 Since we have to remove the word "corruption " from our Kenyan Laws,  we should as well disband the toothless EACC,  and replace it with The Kenya Anti-Theft of Public Assets Authority. Just a special unit to investigate and prosecute thieves of our oil and taxes!

6180 2018-06-04 11:54:07 It’s using descriptors like this “scene from Breaking Bad” that perpetuates the negative stigma. All you need is an oil(coconut), ground #cannabis, cheese cloth, a pressure cooker and a stove. No risk of explosion to make oil!  #CalmDown

6231 2018-06-04 11:44:04 I agree. But we know Tides has funded anti oil activists on Canada. Problem is Leadnow is boasting about what they are doing  btw leadnow was caught even in downtown  vancouver elections previously. So demand Trudeau bans All Third parties

6252 2018-06-04 11:39:31 Exactly. So why do these companies keep doing this & keep putting out a gendered us vs them thing? If I want to buy a shampoo I've gotta get "men ultra" or 'men+care'? where as my sisters get a LOT of variety. nah. I'm having that argon oil & hibiscus whatever pink stuff for me

6255 2018-06-04 11:39:01 As I see it, there are 3 ridiculously oversimplified categories of exports/imports we can discuss with regard to trade - 
1) Raw materials (Timber, ore, crude, etc.)
2) Intermediate materials (Steel, refined oil, etc.)
3) Finished goods (cars, trains, planes, etc.)

6262 2018-06-04 11:37:34 This Government is just another to make a total hash of the UK economy. Thatcher wasted our best opportunity. Wasting our oil revenues on short term propping up the economy to make it look far better than it ever was. Norway used, and is still using theirs in a far better way.
6263 2018-06-04 11:37:23 On what basis is it wrong? Can you offer any examples, or are you just going to trot-out platitudes, which expose both your technical ignorance of the subject matter, and lack of a viable alternative?

PS. Olive oil should not to be used as a shampoo replacement. You’re welcome.

When you snap a leaf off to use for a burn or something, does it grow back?

As a ‘mental health’ ambassador do some research on the benefits of vaping CBD oil, seriously, the stuff saves and will save many more lives, has zero nicotine and is all natural with multiple health benefits, we are just touching the surface
6349 2018-06-04 11:26:05 Please seek some psychological help. You are spiraling into madness! Then seek some spiritual counseling, call the Pope maybe? He is meeting with big oil. I think he would meet with your sorry ass too.

6457 2018-06-04 11:10:58 The whole point if buying pipeline ( which is Liberal federal act, btw, not NDP) is so that we build pipeline. KM was wanting us to pay for pipeline & for them to own it.

will agree to boost supply when they meet in Vienna June 22. News from a meeting of some OPEC and non-OPEC ministers in Kuwait City Saturday did not offer any clues, either. Thanks @VandanaHari_SG!!!
6469 2018-06-04 11:09:06 Oil Prices are on the rise globally, states have no control over the prices of oil. OPEC's decision to cut oil production led to demand &high demand means higher prices.

6470 2018-06-04 11:08:34 Brent crude oil is trading at $75,67 right now.... In 2016 it traded at a record low of $42.33 per barrel.... But petrol prices were not significantly changed throughout this whole time. What exactly is the Correlation?

6500 2018-06-04 11:04:14 I support, oil is a natural resource that should be controlled by the national government. 20% share to the county government and 5% to the community is enough to change the face of turkana county.

6594 2018-06-04 10:48:56 RamadevSwamyji, when RSSBJP National President AmitShah came2your Ashram,did you ask him why diesel&petrol rate is the highest when crude oil in international market is all time low? Why his UnionGovt refuse2 waive farmers GovtBank loans when they waived of MNCs?Rafale scam etc?
6595 2018-06-04 10:48:53 Kristina loved your teddy. Said I’d look great in case the guy wants my virginity not just oral and Kris 

She always covers my ass in baby oil. She said she’d let him inside me if he’d gentle
6596 2018-06-04 10:48:53 And by "compromise", you mean Big Oil wins and corn farmers are  on. Pruitt has single-handed destroyed the RFS, and now foreign exports will count in the mandate? Wth? And why is Pruitt still in office????
6597 2018-06-04 10:48:52 You do realise that coal and oil are the remains of ancient vegetation?

There is no way to distinguish between supposed “anthropogenic” Carbon Dioxide and “natural” Carbon Dioxide.
6598 2018-06-04 10:48:30 Use aloe Vera for scalp and hair. Oil with authentic coconut oil. Onion juice applied twice a week Atleast. Atleast twice a week. Stop with blow drys.Straightening and like dyeing etc. It's not rocket science. Dunno why ppl spend thousands when it can be done in hundreds
6599 2018-06-04 10:47:42 I hate long ass sentences with a bunch of complex words. In universities they give you shit to read and the meaning of 3 line sentence with 7 words you gotta google could literally means “fish is risky because the oil companies had too many oil spills”
6600 2018-06-04 10:47:41 Cad trade by MS looks like not working yet with oil and USD headwinds

6604 2018-06-04 10:46:41 What a hypocrite, he and his fellow Democrats have encouraged higher oil prices as a way to cut consumption

6610 2018-06-04 10:45:16 I did my own arithmetics and adjusting all factors and assumptions the oil will leave us worse off UNLESS we discover more oil reserves @OptaHos  check this
6611 2018-06-04 10:45:15 Aha yes. Kalau macam tu mmg ada chance kulit kering sbb everything is mattifying/oil control. It's either u tukar toner, or tambah some other hydrating stuffs (hydrating toners/serum/essences) dalam routine. Terpulang kat you.

6613 2018-06-04 10:45:09 ~News
Kenya joins league of African oil producers.
6614 2018-06-04 10:45:09 While in Germany, France, and UK the PM should push for long term solution. Iran understands the need for trade with the rest of the world, and West needs their oil – surely peace can be mutually beneficial. It’s religious dogmatism that prevents achieving reasonable agreements.
6615 2018-06-04 10:45:05 "In 2019, we're going to remove oil bloc licences from individuals and give to host communities, because they deserve it"

6616 2018-06-04 10:44:59 Were waiting for ngamia 1 oil scandal to load fully . waiting for data
6617 2018-06-04 10:44:39 Unsustainable palm oil is one of the most environmentally damaging industries in the world, and @Tesco uses over 40,000 tonnes of the stuff each year! This cannot be sustained so ditch it!

6619 2018-06-04 10:44:20 Full gist bro.
6620 2018-06-04 10:44:11 Faces a war? Doubt it. The reason why they’re doing it is because they know Iraq CAN’T retaliate at this point (due to the recent election), they’re cutting the water so they can use it as a tool to get subsidised oil and fast cash. Turkish state never fails to get more inhuman.
6621 2018-06-04 10:44:00 I'm greatly enjoying each of your recent articles. One of the goals of the report was to spark a national debate, and while others have reacted negatively to exactly that, I think it shines a light on Scotland's true asset, one that dwarfs oil, and that's our nations intellect.

6623 2018-06-04 10:43:58 @jimcramer what age should investors stop or at least reduce their risk specifically in speculation stocks?  Are oil stocks based on WTI still specs?  Thanks so much.

6633 2018-06-04 10:41:47 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
6634 2018-06-04 10:41:45 And if I remember rightly, if the PUK were still in Kirkuk, the row would probably still be about Kirkuk oil going to KDP-owned refineries--so PUK were also interested in sending oil to Iran! Also, there were all kinds of KRG-Iran energy plans being discussed.
6635 2018-06-04 10:41:41 Kenya discovered their oil correct. It's not Uganda's oil. its Museveni's oil. Do you mean to say you've never heard him refer to it as his oil in public? He conducts his business with family the way he feels like. how do you tell he hasn't exported his crude oil yet?!

6651 2018-06-04 10:36:40 And why do we still want to export oil while still importing it..
Cant this oil first serve the local market..
I think there is a serious scandal building up..
6652 2018-06-04 10:36:21 Oil funding for so-called Free SHS, is not sustainable; prices could fall, besides oil is not renewable energy source. Special Tax Levy could arrest the situation.
6653 2018-06-04 10:36:17 Remember when President Obama got blamed for an oil spill?
6654 2018-06-04 10:36:15 "Mhm..."

Drizzling some of the oil on the pan, he then turns it on at low heat to slowly cook the bacon.

6663 2018-06-04 10:34:09 Eu, Canada ,Mexico are either dumping their refugees or dumping their illegals into US. All three are drilling for oil and using coal for steel . All of them part of climate accord which was income redistribution for eu,Canada and Mexico along with China and Russia .

6667 2018-06-04 10:33:31 $USDTRY  Looking ahead, we expect inflation to continue to rise with the plunge in currency, spike in oil prices and unsupportive base effects until July, exceeding 14%, and change direction after that, though in the near-term upside risks are likely to remain. @ING_Economics
6668 2018-06-04 10:33:27 Like crude oil!!! Baddest

6670 2018-06-04 10:32:59 So currently we import the already refined oil products??
6671 2018-06-04 10:32:49 Good analysis from @EnergyPhilFlynn on @MorningsMaria with regard to diesel costs and distillation of light crude to diesel fuel.

When with Keystone XL come on-line? How is the Tar Sands for generating the oil to create diesel?

6683 2018-06-04 10:29:02 Peat-based rainforests are one of the most essential tools in the fight against climate change as just one hectare can hold 6,000 tonnes of CO2 (10X more than normal soil!).  Loss of the forests also means villages losing their homes @Tesco –  No more palm oil in Tesco products.

6685 2018-06-04 10:28:43 As well as the recent expansion in the production of cotton. The low grain prices support the livestock industry to be profitable and globally increased demand for oil cake support the production of oil seeds.

6692 2018-06-04 10:28:10 Don’t worry Val you are in the majority. It is difficult to see that a rise in oil prices, wages or a fall in the exchange rate  cannot change the average and only changes relative prices. The average only changes with an increase in monetary demand and who manages that?

6701 2018-06-04 10:27:00 I disagree with the term monopolisation to a certain extent because Petronas owns the oil but we see a lot of competitors foreign and local here in Malaysia.

6729 2018-06-04 10:23:25 Oh, so it's fine for Russia to plunder other countries for their natural riches (it's not just oil, Putin's pal Timchenko is already busy mining Syria's phosphates) because the USA is doing the same?

6886 2018-06-04 09:59:03 Of course you can. Get it really clean and dry first. Warm it up a bit, thin layer of oil, lots of heat
6887 2018-06-04 09:59:00 Maybe most leaders own oil import empires. Maybe we're clearing a debt with crude oil.
6888 2018-06-04 09:58:43  “so poor yet so uppity” eiiii 
But Charle prices are just escalating...so the oil we’re getting from the country itself wassop with it??

6894 2018-06-04 09:57:12 It's worth heating all clothes before getting dressed on cold mornings. You can get heater racks for oil heaters or just drape over top. Showers are optional and some people prefer an evening bath but warm clothes are essential!

6898 2018-06-04 09:56:54 The only way to hurt Putin & his cronies is to move away from oil & gas to renewable energy, Russia's supply of gas to Europe is what is allowing them to get away with this, they can cut off supply whenever they want, so they're basically held hostage

And it’s been a few days and honestly my skin is getting a lot better! My skin hasn’t been producing a lot of oil lately my skin looks more bright and plump and I haven’t had any break outs! This might actually save me.
7306 2018-06-04 08:50:46 high price benefits

-more revenue to govt.

-less consumption means less dependency on jihadi nation for oil

7311 2018-06-04 08:49:33 I think the UK completely changed when we went into the EU - it's about time we embraced lard again instead of all this fancy olive oil stuff. I don't want extra virgin olive oil, I want promiscuous LARD! #Brexit

7323 2018-06-04 08:48:09 I think as the article states long term transport of crude is not viable through any other means. It just means we have to wait longer for the oil to benefit the country. I think it's a good thing.

7419 2018-06-04 08:35:46 that could very well be a US military base. They bill the GI's for spilled oil, so they use cheap carpet to soak it up.
7420 2018-06-04 08:35:38 #Oil prices got off to a lackluster start, as rising #US #crude production and expectations that #OPEC members will raise supplies remained in focus.
7421 2018-06-04 08:35:31 Naturally, one Barrel of oil is equivalent to 159 litres. Kenya will be doing 2000 barrels of oil in a day which translates to 318,000 litres of crude oil per day.
7422 2018-06-04 08:35:21 An increase in crude oil price leads to an increase in transport fares which also leads to an increase in goods and services. This has got nothing to to with @NAkufoAddo

7428 2018-06-04 08:34:10 That's because of the mis information that fats are bad. So people are loaded up with sugars and refined carbs.

7430 2018-06-04 08:33:49 .@Tesco: ditch palm oil in your own brand products! Over 300 football fields of rainforest are cleared EVERY HOUR for new palm oil plantations – and your continued use of palm oil is contributing. Take responsibility!

7471 2018-06-04 08:29:26 Honestly why can't a refinery be built in turkana then send already refined oil to south sudan , ethiopia , parts tanzania and all over kenya . why Mombasa ?
7472 2018-06-04 08:29:22 Nice! I have a rather nice Nard oil incense which is rather special.
7473 2018-06-04 08:29:15 Apply Manpasand oil, you may get the same at Vakrangee store.
7474 2018-06-04 08:29:13 Is it because we import oil and that's why it's built at the coast? What about now that we drill oil at the mainland?
7475 2018-06-04 08:29:07 Gulf shrimp and (subsidised) Corn Belt corn. Two of America's finest. You can't beat that! 

Good to see the shrimp stocks have recovered so healthily since the oil spill.
7476 2018-06-04 08:28:45 The question is how safe is our oil fields,  oil producing countries got war experiences

7499 2018-06-04 08:23:49 Kenya is exporting crude oil at low prices and importing highly-priced refined oil!  What an inefficacious venture!
7500 2018-06-04 08:23:49 A bit like someone moaning about taking oil out an engine because they don't like the "mess it makes" and moaning about people telling you it's needed to make engines work.

7518 2018-06-04 08:20:22 Stale oil that has been stored for long. No one can buy it. It will be stored in Mombasa but no one will ever buy. Just to benefit the transporters.

7525 2018-06-04 08:19:53 Yep, and there's the palm oil in the ingredients, boycott it. Tesco supplies 100% peanut butter and Pip and Nut neither have the evil palm oil as ingredients. So you can enjoy PBJ without having the deaths of orang utans on  your conscience.

7529 2018-06-04 08:18:54 Your oil supplies as well as modern power lines are vulnerable. Power plants are vulnerable. 
Modern telecom is vulnerable.
Go back, be luddite and use locally available technology, it helps in wartime. 
Those nations which never think of war eventually get runover.
7530 2018-06-04 08:18:43 if you want to drive then petrol is a requirement, As long as oil is a strategic resource we will need to be on good relations with these people. It's a fact of life unfortunately

7535 2018-06-04 08:18:24 Thank you for this,

The #PIG is vital to the economy which will help improve the performance of the oil sector by increasing the standard and modules of operation, this will in turn open more ways for new and local refinery to operate.

7543 2018-06-04 08:17:23 You need japani oil in this case. Ayurvedic oil not helpful.
7544 2018-06-04 08:17:18 Great logic. We are speaking of old style railway lines vs fancy metros. Which aren't needed, the project costs are all inflated and huge cutbacks paid within and outside to companies like bombardier
And I am advocating coal not oil.
That's called thinking strategic.

Without an export! Turkana oil can serve Kenya only three years and it's gone. I guess it will be done before the thieves finish their term.

7549 2018-06-04 08:16:22 OK call me crazy but my endocrinologist told me to just use plain ole olive oil, (you can add an ounce essence of cloves  it it will also deter mosquitoes and other pesky bugs lol) and it smells good.

7562 2018-06-04 08:14:01 Coming at a time when crude oil prices at the international market are still depressed at around $50 per barrel, analysts said that Kenya is embarking on a loss-making venture that could cost the taxpayer Ksh4 billion ($40 million).
7563 2018-06-04 08:13:53 In case you don’t do any of these, this is what helps me:

- phone on DND and out of reach
- shower is the absolute last thing before bed
- nothing but water in the last 2 hours before bed
- lavendar oil in the sheets
- breathing meditation once in bed
- ear plugs


7564 2018-06-04 08:13:37 11:13  According to Google maps, Turkana to Mombasa is 1079 kms by road. Not sure if it's feasible to build a refinery in Turkana then distribute the oil products. That should lower the costs. via @Kipchobit #KenyanTraffic

7600 2018-06-04 08:08:06 Rich Nations Spend $100 Billion On Fossil Fuels Despite Climate Pledges

The world's major industrial democracies spend at least $100 billion each year to prop up oil, gas and coal consumption, despite vows to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, a report said on.......
7601 2018-06-04 08:07:38 2. You don't think any gas or oil is turned into CO2 in volcanic activity? And vegetation turns CO2 into O2. It doesn't produce CO2.
7602 2018-06-04 08:07:07 So the analysis used previous low global oil prices. WTI now in the $65 - 67 range. How does that change the expected outcome and viability?

Government has been asked to diversify economic activities in the Albertine region to provide for continuity after extinction of oil in the region.
7606 2018-06-04 08:05:50 The oil from Turkana will not be exported. It will be loaded on ships then the ships will make U-turn in the middle of Indian Ocean back to Kenya as imported crude. The same thieves who were in charge of laptops for class one and NYS are the same ones handling this oil thing.
7607 2018-06-04 08:05:42 So Turkana oil export to China for refinery is a set trap to pay SGR Debt?
7608 2018-06-04 08:05:38 Why don’t you build an oil refinery there than exporting all the way to Mombasa it will reduce the cost and wastage

7611 2018-06-04 08:05:07 That Turkana oil is being transported to Mombasa to wait for potential international markets. Why can't it be refined for domestic use?. Why should we export what we are importing?. I think it will not even be enough for domestic consumption. Bad deal and hype over nothing.

7660 2018-06-04 07:55:52 I'll take a guess here. CO2 in volcanic gas varies according to location and temp, but in principle there should be zero as there are no organics in magma. 
However, coal and oil and shale in the crust, as well as vegetation provides CO2. Just how much of it is #renewables :)

7663 2018-06-04 07:55:38 Oil prices are based on supply&demand. Price rise last decades mostly due to increased demand, primarily from Asia, but also to supply shocks. Most are outside purview of US presidents. Dominant reason today is Venezuela, not Trump's fault. Secondary broken Iran deal, his fault.
7664 2018-06-04 07:55:29 According to Google maps, Turkana to Mombasa is 1079 kms by road. Not sure if it's feasible to build a refinery in Turkana then distribute the oil products. That should lower the costs.

7682 2018-06-04 07:52:06 Yes and no. Wind generation keeps prices for oil lower as it lowers need (demand) for oil in certain areas. So it is in the same market as oil. Only indirectly. But you are right. Once cars become mostly electric, big oil will be in trouble, unless they buy up the wind farms.

7731 2018-06-04 07:43:47 Oh come on guys, transporting 3 litres of crude oil on trucks doesn't make sense.
7732 2018-06-04 07:43:47 The @PresidentKE needed a positive with all corruption going on but are we really an oil producing country? Its more than 10 yrs we have been yapping about oil and we have just managed to harvest apaltry 70k barrels?

7755 2018-06-04 07:39:56 That's going to bw difficult. I mean yes Saudi has said it will seek higher output from OPEC and that calmed speculators a bit.... however, keep in mind Iran is an oil country and everytime we sanction them gas prices rise because x amount of oil is off the market

7763 2018-06-04 07:37:27 The government has increased the tax in a litre of fuel dramatically and this goes hand in hand with the increase in cost of oil - plus the Rand $ exchange. It will reach R20 before the end of the year. Terrible
7764 2018-06-04 07:37:15 brown ppl hair is a bitch and a half as it is, so it's so annoying to deal with this rn lil. I've put so much oil in my hair and it goes nothing.

7786 2018-06-04 07:33:01 I thought that would be prudent. The last time I checked we had Changamwe refinery company what became of it? Maybe it's about time we revive it. But am sure the oil cartels will fight every attempted of revival.

7831 2018-06-04 07:25:49 Also oil exploration is rarely a private concern except in 1st World Countries. And our government has shown time and again an immense capacity for irrationality in its decision making.
7832 2018-06-04 07:25:42 I really hope that the current oil boom from Turkana county will benefit the people of Turkana county  more.  Have loopholes for cartels,  thieves been closed by the way?#STOPTheseTHIEVES @UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto @GovernorNanok @MadiniKenya @TullowOilplc

7869 2018-06-04 07:17:27 @DonaldBKipkorir Tullow expects to pump 2,000 barrels of oil per day. That's 318,000 litres per day, and 113,208,000 litres per year. Guess the tanker you're talking about could actually carry this amount so as to make it one tanker per year. Don't peddle lies. Do some research!

7876 2018-06-04 07:16:03 With due respect, while protesting is your right and, given our history, it has been proven to be an useful tool, the rise in fuel is largely due to external factors. The rise of the barrel crude oil price to over 80 dollars being the main contributor.

Oil is not being exported.
Oil will never be exported. 
The oil being transported from Turkana East to Mombassa is old stale stored oil that has been in the tanks since August 2015.
Turkana Oil is going nowhere. It will rot in the already rotting tanks in Mombassa.

8003 2018-06-04 06:54:29 @lizzo last semester in one of my classes my professor asked us to play a song that spoke to who we are and where we are in life. Coconut   Oil was played. And black girl magic was felt!

8008 2018-06-04 06:53:17 "You don't have to be scared of boiling oil. . ." He facepalms. "Kun Ramsay, then." He starts to laugh.
8009 2018-06-04 06:52:59 .@Tesco over 120,000 people have already signed the petition calling on your supermarkets to ditch palm oil from your own brand products! It is clear the people (who shop in your stores everyday) want change NOW! Ditch palm oil!

8013 2018-06-04 06:52:21 @Rainbow941fm
Barrister the price of oil has risen,how on earth are we still buying fuel at 145? Nobody is protesting? Are Nigerians born to suffer?
I can tell Nigerians for free,regardless of the oil price dey will suffer until dey remember Femi kuti song."them bobo us"

8015 2018-06-04 06:51:50 I went to a "prophecy club" where they invite "prophets" to come speak.  Usually, some totally respectable prophet talks about his vision of Russia shooting nukes at us within the next year.  Or how we should invest in his oil drilling company to bless Israel. #ChristianAltFacts

8017 2018-06-04 06:51:19 Lol, it’s not a Traeger. I went with the Camp Chef. The trick to getting the char is to shake them in a bit of avocado oil. Put them in a big plastic tub with a couple tbsp of oil and shake the crap out of it. I brush a little buffalo on towards the end of the cook too.
8018 2018-06-04 06:51:18 Its still servicing...oil level has nothing to do with it
8019 2018-06-04 06:51:16 We knew we had oil ten years ago but shut down the refinery 3 years ago ok.

8032 2018-06-04 06:48:24 @Tesco when are you going to ditch palm oil products? Show some leadership and responsibility - the longer you wait, the worse the fallout will be.

8035 2018-06-04 06:48:15 The oil is here now in Kenya , is it for Kenyan consumption or for export, Kenyans spend billions to import oil , Libya gives their citizen the first priority while in USA they have a stock that can be used for the next 10 years without importing .
8036 2018-06-04 06:48:04 Make sure to not get pores dirty use oil free cleanser if ur oily! And don’t wear foundation
8037 2018-06-04 06:48:00 Was actually the oiling afterwards that fracked me :( oil had a hardening component and we waited too long to wipe excess oil away so it already started to harden :(

8039 2018-06-04 06:47:43 My friend said regular  and coconut oil making her skin glow. Explains why I’m having a breakout.
8040 2018-06-04 06:47:38 No. Still same. Windmills used for decades for pumping water. Wind blows lots in Plains states. Most farmers don't own oil wells. Plus since farmers cant save seeds easily or at all because of Monsanto , the farmers cut every cost they can.
8041 2018-06-04 06:47:30 We're transportating our crude oil, for export, with trucks fueled by imported oil! Another Nigeria in the making, all in the name of "a new chapter."
8042 2018-06-04 06:47:24 RT RoKhanna: Some of the same members of Congress who say that Medicare for all is too expensive had no problem voting for yet another massive increase in military spending. We have to start putting American lives over barrels of oil and fighter jets.

8050 2018-06-04 06:45:26 Indeed, I wonder what this implies about future oil production expectations. It will be very interesting to see if OPEC is swimming without a bathing suit.

8056 2018-06-04 06:44:23 .@Tesco: ditch palm oil in your own brand products! Over 300 football fields of rainforest are cleared EVERY HOUR for new palm oil plantations – and your continued use of palm oil is contributing. Take responsibility!

8085 2018-06-04 06:40:30 Shouldn't we have raised thz issues when oil was still underground and before the contracts were signed??someone should have gone to court.
8086 2018-06-04 06:40:13 Again. False analogy. Nigeria produces a lot of oil. And consumes a lot of it. It can [& should] have mega-refineries. Their's is a case of awful governance. Can we (Kenya) sustain a mega-refinery like Singapore? Yes, but it requires a huge investment & efficient port
8087 2018-06-04 06:40:10 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
8088 2018-06-04 06:40:08 That ship sailed more than ten years ago when the three oil majors sold their 50% shareholding to an Indian MNC which eventually sold out to GOK; why not participate in the planned oil refinery in Uganda or even establish an EAC refinery in Tanga?

Does it mean you see no value in standing with the girls, or that political movements / oil discussions are more important than comforting the bereaved?
8099 2018-06-04 06:37:33 The chorus of praise from Turkana residents that came with the flagging of crude oil from Lokichar will soon fizzle out. It would later dawn on them that the event was dressed up to disguise the fact that foreign interests still owns the Oil.

8153 2018-06-04 06:26:46 Kenya had a refinery in Mombasa. 
It’s too old and it wasn’t meant for they type of oil discovered in Kenya 
Just like a car engine to shift petrol to diesel . Too costly
8154 2018-06-04 06:26:33 They told us importing refined oil is cheaper than refining our own for domestic consumption. The same script they fed us about coffee, or why it's favourable to sell our flowers to South Africa via an auction in Amsterdam! When we enquired further, they told us to read economics
8155 2018-06-04 06:26:31 As per the 4th of June 2018, the Oil Archetype Index does not indicate a BUY signal for the oil price

8161 2018-06-04 06:25:36 We are a country of misplaced priorities y export crude oil and import refined oil with our refinery literally killed,revive it employ more
8162 2018-06-04 06:25:35 What's was he anointing them for exactly? Well, anointing oil is just oil without power of God embedded in it.  

This is really not a big deal as anyone can buy GOYA OIL and rub it on some sycophantic idiots forehead in a Church-like gathering.
8163 2018-06-04 06:25:29 What saved the whales from being hunted to extinction for whale oil in the 1800s? Protests? Advocacy Groups? Op-Eds? 

Nope. 

Petroleum came along as a better alternative to whale oil and thus saved the whales. So how do we solve today's problems? Create better #alternatives.

8178 2018-06-04 06:23:09 Oil is traded in the high seas and again from Ngamia to the refinery abroad and back to Mombasa is more expensive than from the high seas to Mombasa/Eldoret  and into the market
8179 2018-06-04 06:22:39 Turkana oil export is a huge milestone in Kenyan economy, but unless we exorcise the ghost of corruption, it will be a curse rather a blessing.

8188 2018-06-04 06:21:12 YAY! okay ladies I love talking about oil. Oil is pure thc that is extracted from the plant. They range in percentages and even some are flavored! You can infuse joints with oil, or crumble some on top of a bowl, or you can just smoke the oil in a dab rig.

8204 2018-06-04 06:18:37 Wishful thinking. I support your idea. But to be honest, the current government and its caretaker team are hell bent in exporting the oil. That's the only way to reap Turkana people clean. Turkana people should invest in their 'think tanks' for benefits to be realised
8205 2018-06-04 06:18:25 Pple choose to ignore the fact that we have 60 minerals. Zim is a honey pot, if well managed we can live well. Currently our wealth is benefits only a few.

8217 2018-06-04 06:17:13 It sucks, last time I came in contact with it I had to go to the ER. The oil bonds to your skin and your immune system believes those areas are a foreign invader. I have lots of scars from my run ins with the plant over the years.

8283 2018-06-04 06:06:07 According the the evangelical prosperity gospel their priests are successful because of God and that is why you should follow them and give more. I was thinking about this last night & I realized that God gave the Muslim Mullahs the oil which is way more than American Evangelists

8288 2018-06-04 06:05:21 Kenyan oil must be melted to facilitate flow.
What'll be the cost of heating & maintaining that status down to Lamu?
Why not refine @ source

8292 2018-06-04 06:04:24 If by any chance the government tells you that building an oil refinery at Lokichar is not viable ask them to give you the break even point (in business terms: where revenues equal costs) of the SGR. @EAukot @JAKADAWA @JeremiahSilale @ekiru_ekeno

8294 2018-06-04 06:04:01 I sympathize with Turkana peoples. They have been marginalized by consecutive governments since independence. Oil could have been an equaliser, apparently the same people who denied resources & development to Turkana people are the one deciding what share they should get from oil

8300 2018-06-04 06:03:23 I put some eucalyptus oil in steaming water when I had a sinus infection, but I also took antibiotics. And I used my daily inhaler, and my rescue inhaler when it started to move into my chest, before the antibiotics kicked in. I can't imagine taking a kid off their meds.
8301 2018-06-04 06:03:12 #RBD. Oulton appraisal - Schlumberger report  - 2C contingent resources of 13.9 million barrels of oil and 4.4BCF of gas!!! That’s a fair bit!! Best estimate prospective resource of 31 million barrels of oil and 26BCF of gas.
8302 2018-06-04 06:01:50 Wise King Solomon said: "The annoying drip of drops on a rainy day and a quarrelsome woman are so similar! It is impossible to stop her complaints, how to stop the wind or keep something slippery with oil hands." This is a lesson of tolerance.
8303 2018-06-04 06:01:10 The government of Denmark has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Mark Wahlberg in a coir wig.

8307 2018-06-04 06:00:12 thugs raided a village near Bethlehem. Israel has killed at an official. Knowing more about the high oil price promotes conservation, so
8308 2018-06-04 06:00:11 @grav3yardgirl this is a really weird specific thing but I was always so in love with the oil slicky/metal/titanium  colour mesh  watch you use to wear! Where did you get it? I hope you know what I’m talking about.
8309 2018-06-04 06:00:07 They only export what they do not need. They refine their for domestic use. Only Nigeria exports crude oil and re-imports the same refined oil at a higher cost. and you know the kind of corruption there makes NYS look like heaven

8335 2018-06-04 05:54:50 It must also be said that demand for oil increased by a million barrels per day last year, and will likely increase by a million barrels per day this year as well.  Oil executives around the world will see increased profits till the economy contracts in late 2019/ early 2020.

8352 2018-06-04 05:51:17 Consecutive Kenyan administrations promise job creation but once elected they embark on export of  raw materials. What is the magic of creating jobs without value addition? Turkana Oil now follows the 55 year Tea and Coffee export vicious cycle

8360 2018-06-04 05:49:50 The reason for the hastened oil export is not for the money we get out of it. The reason is so that we can float a bond in the international market to get a higher loan since oil is a proven ability to repay. Kenya cannot borrow for now but will qualify soon. Cc @luthercrop
8361 2018-06-04 05:49:45 Nope. Kannadigas and malyalis take the cream jobs. Like IT. Biharis and UPites are labour class. Working in Cab business, construction, oil rigs etc. that’s why you don’t hear of them. I was in Dubai for a long time. We ran programmes for these skilled class.

8381 2018-06-04 05:45:35 To anyone saying #Bitcoin needs “marketing”. It’s a decentralised protocol.

Marketing is a Howey test for $crypto - if it has a department, it’s a shitcoin.

There’s no marketing for crude oil, gold, silver, gas, or the internet, so how can there be marketing for bitcoin?
8382 2018-06-04 05:45:34 Poor countries started feeling the pain caused by the oil cartel.

8413 2018-06-04 05:40:13 Instead of instigating people,it will be a great service to nation if you tell people that there is very little BJP or UPA can do anything about oil price. With tax or without tax people will be required to pay some time more or less as they r controlled internationally.

8416 2018-06-04 05:39:49 Hi yes, we are very excited, we want to let everyone know what treats they can eat without palm oil and without spending lots of money.  We don't like products that are expensive just because they can say they don't have palm oil!!
8417 2018-06-04 05:39:41 Coconut oil have so many uses 
8418 2018-06-04 05:39:11 Limit your oil usage. 

Remember Oil are processed. It is best to limit their use whenever possible because they are not whole food. Eating too much oil may cause inflammation and heart disease.

8426 2018-06-04 05:37:15 When an oil drop is stationary, it is because it carries an electric charge
8427 2018-06-04 05:37:10 This 100% works in my kitchen. But the peppermint oil I bought is so strong that I can only spray it just before I leave the house.

8429 2018-06-04 05:37:03 Fine. 
But a word of warning,  hearing messages which are comforting is quite dangerous. Especially when no rigorous tests have been applied. It could snake oil. 

People are inherently biased and believe things they want to hear.

8434 2018-06-04 05:36:31 Do you think it's economical to export crude oil then import it as refined for twice the price?
8435 2018-06-04 05:36:10 The problem is those looters who will loot the contribution from the crude oil. Kaa chonjo with looters not to supply Air to the crude oil company.

8444 2018-06-04 05:35:13 30 years was reasonable - 30 years ago, when the oil companies launched a Big Tobacco -style campaign to confuse the issue & delay action, so they could keep making big bucks.

Now it's critical. We don't have time to dither, developing marginal supplies for declining technology.

The war is over land, water, oil/gas and power.
8454 2018-06-04 05:33:35 Dude they introduced this mechanism. The oil prices surged so much and increases were hefty and then opposition Ur favourite NAMO see their speeches. U people r dumb. Go thru that situation and u will realise the realty.

8480 2018-06-04 05:30:05 But since you ask, how about sanctioning any state which practices Salafism. There is little political will to do so because we rely too much on oil and make too much money selling them weapons. Look at the BAE systems scandal.

8528 2018-06-04 05:21:50 Sir, your standpoint is a vital and relevant one as to the issues that underlie the Turkana oil charade. It is very naive to tell the locals that oil belong to them while in fact a certain foreign company has legal rights to it. Very naive indeed.

8536 2018-06-04 05:20:36 The question of whether to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been an ongoing political controversy in the United States since 1977. As of 2017, Republicans have attempted to allow drilling in ANWR

8543 2018-06-04 05:19:20 We do but we can't quit oil cold turkey without disrupting the economy big time.
8544 2018-06-04 05:19:06 No way! I haven't been there since they started an oil free menu! Going to go asap. Thanks!!
8545 2018-06-04 05:18:35 I want that, as well as public driving ranges placed sporadically along the border with the back stop being the wall like 300 yards out. Could make money for CBP, make it a bit of a tourist attraction, and it would help aid in defending the homeland
8546 2018-06-04 05:18:29 One quarter-ounce uranium fuel pellet (7g) has the energy-to-electricity equivalence of 3.5 barrels of oil which is equivalent to 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas or nearly a ton of coal.

8552 2018-06-04 05:17:53 That is silly, we need to get off fossils as much as possible, relying on Middle East oil reserves has just made it easier to engage in our fossil fuel addiction, and probably destroying the planet. It has been bad for us on every level. And we pay with how much the military cost
8553 2018-06-04 05:17:21 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.

8555 2018-06-04 05:17:08 Has Kenya really exported oil? Is it viable? The more you try to spin this story the more it looks like #KenyaOil is a scam
8556 2018-06-04 05:16:59 The Oil export ban was lifted a few yrs ago. America exports a lot of Oil and you suffer for that at the pumps and with your heating costs. Profits are more important than the people. Big Oil and the Gov't make lots at our expense.

8601 2018-06-04 05:11:29 Why would I do that? My electricity is Hydro. Unless the Great Lakes run dry, I'll be OK. Oil isn't used to generate electricity anyway. Not in this part of the World anyway.

8612 2018-06-04 05:09:43 Absolutely.  Even a layman, a well meaning layman, would have passed on such advantage of low oil prices to the economy.

Cant understand the intent of Modi in not doing so !
8613 2018-06-04 05:09:29 That it is the cause of surging prices of commodities, now Russia and Saudi looking at producing more oil, hence petrol co now doing rollbacks. So where Train stands here?

8627 2018-06-04 05:07:01 When should we start expecting cheaper oil? When should all oil related product prices drop, or another scandal will make it even harder to reap its benefits, are we even ready or it's just a knee jerk reaction to all that is going on. Someone needs to ask these and more.

8692 2018-06-04 04:56:21 @UKenyatta & @AdanMohamedCS consider building an oil refinery in the Northern Kenya. It's ROI is guaranteed with South Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda etal being potential clients as well. You mentioned manufacturing as one of the big 4. Here you have a chance
8693 2018-06-04 04:55:58 My neighbours really need to oil their garage door. It sounds like the stuff of nightmares.
8694 2018-06-04 04:55:52 Honestly i think grapeseed oil is the reason my hair is just blossoming  i be shook everyday like DAMN!

8698 2018-06-04 04:54:19 Iam still learning about oil business.I don't have any idea how it works.Are we happy of a non existent material?
8699 2018-06-04 04:54:09 Their biggest dilemma is all the Countries that don't want to use the US Dollar to buy & sell Oil. That's why Saddam was killed.
8700 2018-06-04 04:54:04 O, before Claude Sullivan died had you heard Cawood call that many games? I didn't even know who he was until Claude died and Cawood took over the statewide radio network (I think it was the Standard Oil Network) and not just the WHAS broadcasts. Talk about two great announcers!
8701 2018-06-04 04:53:56 Anyway, @DavidNdii what does numbers say on the economic viability of the 624 barrels of oil that went to Mombasa yesterday? At least I know we are 400 barrels ahead of Malawi.
8702 2018-06-04 04:53:51 I would hardly say held hostage. Move! AB has the best wages and work,  has the least amount of taxes then any other province, we have it better then anyone, have for a long time now we have done a lot of damage over the 44 years the oil biz bought the gov. Time to pay for that.
8703 2018-06-04 04:53:40 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
8704 2018-06-04 04:53:36 Also is it better America bombs and kills people in the name of oil? How Christian is that?

8712 2018-06-04 04:52:01 How come in all these oil talks @RailaOdinga and @WilliamsRuto  continues to place ignorant faces in all of it yet they got opportunity to influence construction of an oil refinery either in Eldoret or Kisumu which is complete wt an international airport, KPC pipeline and storage

8714 2018-06-04 04:51:48 So folks are celebrating the “transport” of crude oil that we didn’t discover, drill, produce/extract, add value to or even export.
8715 2018-06-04 04:51:42 Everything is crude oil ba? So north can't or doesn't produce anything to add to the Nations income?

8720 2018-06-04 04:51:07 There is nothing there. This is politics as usual at the rate of 2000barels a day to fill a modest oil tanker  of 400000barels  those lorries will be on the road  daily  for  7 months .who is going to pay the transporter. Where is the market? And what is the cost of storage?

Lesson learned.
8728 2018-06-04 04:49:36 @GovernorNanok why do we need to ship OIL from TURKANA to MOMBASA?? Can't we localize the oil by building a refinery in Turkana?? It will create jobs to the locals and eventually it will be cheaper. Let's thinks beyond tomorrow Cc @UKenyatta @MadiniKenya @TullowOilplc

8730 2018-06-04 04:49:20 It was really a great day for Kenya as the President @UKenyatta flagged off Crude Oil in Turkana. As this is being done, Kenya should learn lessons from its sister African countries which are Oil Producers with nothing to show. WE NEED TO REFINE OUR OWN OIL..!

8736 2018-06-04 04:48:31 Didn’t we have peak oil in the 80’s then the 90’s and just a few years ago? Fact is no matter how the eco nutters spin it the end of oil is a fantasy & won’t be seen for many decades to come if ever

8760 2018-06-04 04:45:33 Small tip: adding ground black pepper (as well as fat) to your turmeric concoction will increase absorption and effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory  – this could e.g. take the form of cooking with pepper and olive oil, or a hot drink with coconut cream.
8761 2018-06-04 04:45:19 Now that we have oil ready for export. Kamau atafute market we get 100% waiver on kra returns wenye we've not filed.

8764 2018-06-04 04:45:03 Apparently a lot of women have been going crazy over @FinnBalor ever since the video of him putting baby oil on himself went viral. Most have probably changed their panties more than two times when they imagine themselves putting baby oil on Finn.
8765 2018-06-04 04:44:56 everything can be a fetish. but what matters is if you're being conscientious of the people around you. I like old dudes, but I'm not going to go full piss-forest and do what FF14 did by forcing you to oil an old dude up.
8766 2018-06-04 04:44:55 I love my toes when they are freshly done with the oil on them  not sure if freshly a word butttt

8783 2018-06-04 04:41:44 75% of rivers and delta are igbo. Oil politics made them carved into those states to deny the igbos their right. How can you speak igbo, answer igbo name, your town has igbo name, you eat igbo food, have igbo culture and say you are not igbo?  Igbos know where their brothers are
8784 2018-06-04 04:41:38 @Locham_David @UKenyatta So far the community is unaware of how they can gain from this oil. They are also watching through media.
8785 2018-06-04 04:41:26 The reason social costs are relevant is that they drive the price Saudi has to secure in the market to maintain social cohesion. Who cares if you can pull oil out of the ground for $9/barrel if you have a fiscal breakeven of $85/barrel? Looks like MBS gets it, even if you don't.

8796 2018-06-04 04:39:24 It will take years to work out the bugs and build all the infrastructure.  In the meantime,  the price of oil will drop once the realization hits the markets that the oil economy is on it's way out.
8797 2018-06-04 04:39:17 A civilization cannot deal with oil when it is still fighting over water
8798 2018-06-04 04:38:56 Rent is too high in Canada cause of low interest rates. 

Our oil is the worst kind. It's poisoning the Athabaska, which then poisons 25% of the north's watershed.

This industry will shrivel and die because the energy cost of extracting our dirty crude is too high for profits

8800 2018-06-04 04:38:28 I guess the range is quite high in terms of production costs for many countries (w/out social costs). Any source which breaks this down to different reserves’ cost ranges like tight oil, deepsea, tar sands, arctic? The more specified the better!
8801 2018-06-04 04:38:23 Not a single hint on any intention to refine  the oil.Ain't we headed the Nigerian way?A refinery is way beneficial than the Sgr.

8804 2018-06-04 04:37:58 That Jubilee will be exporting crude oil from Turkana to China and then importing it back, is one of the biggest joke of our lifetime
It’s cheaper to upgrade the changamwe refinery than ship the oil to China, unless the export is for paying China for building the SGR to Naivasha!
8805 2018-06-04 04:37:57 I disagree with him on the oil pipelines, net neutrality, militarization of police, torture, government spying, his missile strikes in the middle east, his war on drugs, his 21 and up gun ownership idea, his bumb stock ban to name a few.

8826 2018-06-04 04:35:41 突然ですがこんにちは柳屋あんず油・公式です(｡uωu))ﾍﾟｺﾘ つぶやき拝見しました。伸びがいいので付け過ぎご注意です。１滴〜毛先中心に、髪の根元を避けてお試し下さい♪タオルドライ後の半濡髪に１滴〜少量を手の平に伸ばし「毛先」から付けて乾かすと馴染みやすいです☆
8827 2018-06-04 04:35:34 Why not Europe or Asia?? If we sell horticulture to them, why not crude oil, plus many oil producing countries sell it crude.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
8830 2018-06-04 04:35:20 Correct. As an Oil rich Country, the US should set it's own prices. Gas should only be about $1/Gal. not $5. World Oil prices shouldn't dictate US prices. But, that would be fair so it won't happen if Big Oil has any say, and they always do!
8831 2018-06-04 04:34:46 [whispers] rosehip oil is the bomb

8836 2018-06-04 04:34:11 Had the oil too hot for the egg !! The more you take your time in cooking the dish the better it will be when it’s presented 
8837 2018-06-04 04:34:06 being in the oil/gas & mining fields "fatigue management" is a big deal. Companies don't want to be accountable for your health decline, (allthough 12 hour days for weeks on end are not optional!) I can go with this.
8838 2018-06-04 04:33:57 Got a job offer for the oil fields and man I’m interested but such a long distance
8839 2018-06-04 04:33:55 突然ですがこんにちは柳屋あんず油・公式です(ﾉ･∀･`)ご存知かもですが想像より伸びがいいので１滴〜毛先中心にお試し下さい。タオルドライ後に１滴〜少量を手の平に伸ばし毛先中心に付けると馴染みやすく、再度タオルドライし余分なオイルをオフするのも良いです

8842 2018-06-04 04:33:29 I have been eliminated certain foods or substances and today I consumed sugar for the first time in almost two weeks and I got so woozy and sick to my stomach I had to sit down and drink half a liter of water and take my cbd oil an hour early. Whew. Detoxing is no joke.
8843 2018-06-04 04:33:22 if you haven’t already, start flushing out your ears daily with a mild salt water solution (or baby oil if you have it). put a couple drops in your ear- keep your head tilted for 5 minutes so it doesn’t come out. then let it drip out after 5 minutes. that’ll loosen the ear wax.

8966 2018-06-04 04:11:15 Exactly. Why should we export crude oil then only to end up importing a refined oil? If we can do the refining then it will have a three fold effect: creating jobs, cheaper fuel at stations and improving our economy.

8968 2018-06-04 04:10:43 So you'll reduce tax, hike salaries and employ us youths. That's the start of development. I can't wait that day to come. Hope those corrupt leaders won't loot our crude oil. We live with fear everyday cos corruption is killing us daily

8975 2018-06-04 04:09:49 Horgan argues that Canada should refine oil here—thus creating permanent jobs—rather than shipping it to China to be reformed which would therefore cut down on tanker traffic and the risk of threatening the coast.

9004 2018-06-04 04:05:23 Dont know how that would work, surely the fryer oil would go crazy
9005 2018-06-04 04:05:18 This is Opecs doing. Our oil production is coming up and is threatening them. These prices were set months in advance and not by the US. I know this because I retired from the oil refining business. We will have to ride this out more than likely.

9010 2018-06-04 04:04:55 The whole concept of value addition is lost. I thought we would process and refine the crude oil to complete products. Can't the Mombasa refinery be used for that?

9015 2018-06-04 04:04:01 Maybe economists could stop drooling over GDP numbers long enough to figure out who exactly is benefiting from all that oil money.  With royalty and tax rates so low, the government isn't getting a big piece.  And with oil companies slashing jobs, it isn't the workers either.
9016 2018-06-04 04:03:56 Pro tip ; if you smoke outside light a pine scented incense and spray the area with 1 part skin so soft , 1 part water & a few drops of ginger essential oil . No bugs .

9028 2018-06-04 04:02:26 Because, 
1. It's obvious there's no oil.
2. The little oil was supposed to be transported by the old railway line (RvR) which would benefit public coffers more but now it is being hauled by privately owned trucks, meaning more money for vultures/hyenas/faceless gangs. 
9029 2018-06-04 04:02:06 Lysine would MAINLY be just for health but the oils might actually help w/ the seizures, maaaybe (hemp oil may be a consideration, too) - just super-research it first then if interested run by the vet.

9034 2018-06-04 04:01:28 Hi NTV,I strongly believe we should have made our own oil refinery here then export a finished product,@AnyangNyongo good to see you,what do you think of this measure where we export the raw material only to import a finished product,

9073 2018-06-04 03:55:42 In the absence of these subsidies not being reinstated as most of these governments would face fiscal pressure or debt downgrades, this move in oil has a higher potential to bring inflation. Other things to note that, most of these key countries have become bigger importers since

9100 2018-06-04 03:52:14 Anyone take nutritional supplements for their beauty/wellness routine? Wondering if it's just snake oil or something that can do more than topical products (when combined with balanced/healthy meals and exercise ofc).
9101 2018-06-04 03:52:13 Tried some CBD oil for the first time tonight... I can testify that it really works. My aches and pains were gone within 15 minutes. Two thumbs up

9110 2018-06-04 03:51:02 No self-serve gas pumps. You pulled up and a man filled your tank and washed your windows. Maybe checked your oil and tire pressure, too. Never a woman, though. It was unladylike and what did they know about cars anyway, right?

9146 2018-06-04 03:46:26 I was writing out my grocery list earlier and remembered I needed to buy some extra virgin olive oil. So I wrote it down, where I usually abbreviate it as EVOO.

But I am looking it over it right now and I see that I wrote OVO.

So I, uh... I guess I listen to too much Drake.

Currently it's a tossup between the oil sheikhs and the bargain basement manufacturers. I  hope the US stays engaged despite us.

9411 2018-06-04 03:08:15 So you're pressuring China on stir sticks?  China is the main contributor to plastic in the ocean but UN insists on blaming oil and gas.  Ban the UNFCCC unless its members agree to abstain from hydrocarbons and HC products (including plastics).

9417 2018-06-04 03:07:18 Had a fun discussion last night that I actually quite enjoyed taking a closer look at USS Arizona images via Google.  Also a bit of a loose KanColle spin to it that USS Arizona is still crying tears (of oil) still to this day of having been sunk with USS Missouri watching her
9418 2018-06-04 03:07:13 Election next year and #oil will decide the outcome.

9426 2018-06-04 03:06:34 Russia has sent ground troops at exquisite timing and the order is coming back in the Middle East. USA wants to bring about wars again, even if giving Jerusalem to Zionist. USA is a oil drinking monster.
9427 2018-06-04 03:06:19 First we have to admit that we are a corrupt nation, give a broke driver refined petroleum and he will pass by 20 filling stations by the time he gets to mobasa.. Give them the worthless crude oil and no one will be interested..

9435 2018-06-04 03:05:44 Is too much oil to ingest causes your bowels to be hyperactive? 
9436 2018-06-04 03:05:41 So higher oil price is a blessing in disguise that cures dutch disease by restoring the equilibrium of competitiveness with currency depreciation !

9442 2018-06-04 03:04:54 Saddam Hussein was killed by the world's PRIME TERRORISTS because he wanted to price Iraqi oil in Euros & not US dollars anymore. Gaddafi was killed by the same TERRORISTS because he wanted Africa to use its own currency (African Dinar) backed by gold. African leaders kept quiet.

9449 2018-06-04 03:03:20 They both have variable costs. Upgrading variable cost is more volatile if you consider the price of the bitumen feedstock. I've been in construction, ops and maintenance of oil sands mining, extraction, SAGD and upgrading projects for 30 years. The difference is that extreme.

9451 2018-06-04 03:02:48 Historically US is a big net oil importers (post 70’s) and those Saudi have made their point clear when they regime change Carter.
And still a net importers when Soviet Union is dead. Which made US involvement in the Mideast as the most make sense involvement (pre shale).
9452 2018-06-04 03:02:47 We went to Costco today for some frozen blueberries, Clorox wipes and cold cuts.

9520 2018-06-04 02:52:18 Pretty surprising that Attock Oil managed to beat out PSO, Shell & Total for the new ISB Airport gas station . 

Nice for Attock, but it is neither an international brand (familiarity for first time visitors) nor the national retailer. 

Wonder how the decision was made.
9521 2018-06-04 02:52:17 Not yet your not! Only burning 10pm oil.
9522 2018-06-04 02:51:42 I swear i love my nieces but i promise they live to piss me off. I just got my face oil this weekend and only used it twice but now a quarter of it is gone cus they wanna play with it. THIS SHIT EXPENSIVE. FUCK!!!!
9523 2018-06-04 02:51:38 And for the most part, any money raised has been through internal efforts and not some mighty oil bastard. Doubt that'll be considered though.

9526 2018-06-04 02:51:05 So, have you spent much time in FL? I don’t mean downtown Orlando, but like swamps, bug spray, & good ol boys FL. The term oil slick is routinely tossed around in public pools. There’s still black paint in the corners of classroom windows from the black-out during segregation.
9527 2018-06-04 02:51:01 Are absolutely atrocious. Even some coconut oil would help them. 
9528 2018-06-04 02:51:00 @realDonaldTrump please don’t let pharmaceutical companies take over cbd oil. It’s helping people and it will be too expensive for most to get if the patent goes thru. It’s all about $$$
9529 2018-06-04 02:50:45 I guy would fill the tank, clean the windshield and check the oil when I got gas.

9536 2018-06-04 02:50:07 I heated my child’s towel in the dryer after her evening bath before wrapping her up in it and carrying her to the room to care for her hair with leave in conditioner by Aussie, argan oil, a scalp massage and a good ole’ scratchin’..... she’s not spoiled

9547 2018-06-04 02:48:58 "Conservative" used to mean cautious, prudent, resistant to change, frugal. It has not meant that in common usage for over 30 yrs. Now it means valuing fetuses, billionaires, oil and guns above all else. Mindless anti-governmentarianism with the aim to destroy democracy.

9553 2018-06-04 02:47:34 I also stress how my hairdresser is my lifeline and how much time it takes to keep up with it. I have to buy purple shampoo, treatments, conditioner, on top of using argon oil and a leave in conditioner from lush to make sure it doesn’t dry out as much.
9554 2018-06-04 02:47:33 So these past week I decided not to blow dry my hair & my hair seems to be healthier! yeay! Shampoo I'm still using the Kerastase but the Conditioner paling best di dunia so far is the Head & Shoulder argan oil tu.

It sounds more like you don’t like what he said simply because it doesn’t align with what you lobby for!
9557 2018-06-04 02:47:19 Hope now Kenya joins OPEC, but my question is are we going to export the crude oil then after refining we import it back for our use

So...
9625 2018-06-04 02:32:23 If course this won't stop Belize from importing HydroCarbons. Their position would at least be honorable, if an exploration ban, was backed up with an import ban as well. This is grandstanding. Choosing to foist the rewards, risks, externalities, of oil/gas extraction on others.

9651 2018-06-04 02:27:31 history will show that erdogan made a (bizarre) set of strategic errors when he started working with Isis, selling their oil for his own profit, and facilitating Iran sanctions-busting, all at the same time.

9660 2018-06-04 02:25:45 I don't even love in NY and I know what that means smh get with the program JUNE. It's referencing to peak oil. Off peak means it has yet to peak. DUH
9661 2018-06-04 02:25:42 Thanks, sister girl. That @fentybeauty brown sugar body lava and baby oil gel!
9662 2018-06-04 02:25:29 That’s what I’m saying. She’s getting big paychecks. They’re like oil and water...
9663 2018-06-04 02:25:25 Looking ahead to this week-

$BABA - see if it can gap open and leave 205 behind
$REGN - 50D ma watch
$WLL - holding v strong with oil pullback; cd go multi-pts on s/t oil bottom
$ALGN - looking for s/t short on more strength
9664 2018-06-04 02:25:22 That is interesting...  more of a smart lock
9665 2018-06-04 02:25:21 The oil has spent decades and billions fighting climate action. What are you talking about 'they don't force people'.

9667 2018-06-04 02:25:06 The Epsom salt & eucalyptus oil bath was really nice. Now I’m wrapped up in a robe playing more Technobabylon. Self care!
9668 2018-06-04 02:24:58 Actually by definition we are close. 3rd world means deriving most income from raw materials. With the amount of income from Oil and gas we are technically a rich 3rd world country.
9669 2018-06-04 02:24:48 We have the largest oil in our country DA READ not Russia nor Venezuela. Why we have high gas prices. READ canada ding weed X Art teacher never owned or budgets DAddy owned him.

9672 2018-06-04 02:24:24 Considering also.. Oil companies constricting oil prices to bankrupt Venezuela.. This is hardly a free market is it?!?
9673 2018-06-04 02:24:17 So with it We produced gardens of date-palms and grapes for you, in which is abundant fruit for you and you eat therefrom. (19) And created the tree that comes forth from Mount Sinai – that grows containing oil and curry for the eaters.

9677 2018-06-04 02:23:38 As oil prices rise from $40 to $80 a barrel, airlines who could not make a profit at the lower price will not survive says @Ryanair CEO #IATAAGM
9678 2018-06-04 02:23:30 Sir @narendramodi please explain why oil prices are record high. We are lower middle class family. We are having difficulties due to raised price of fuel. please be kind to us.
9679 2018-06-04 02:23:27 Yes, it's a credible mechanism. 

His latest oxChol paper is interesting, although badly designed and not clearly written.

Needed two more arms with no added fat but added chol.

"Lard oil" that caused increased oxLDL and testicular shrinkage?

9683 2018-06-04 02:22:41 REUTERS: U.S. crude oil futures dipped for a third consecutive session on Monday, with prices coming under pressure from record U.S. output and expectations of higher OPEC supplies.
9684 2018-06-04 02:22:37 Am happy with the flagging off first consignment of crude oil from Ngamia 8, in the #Turkana oil fields but saddened that we are exporting it! How can we become industrialized country by exporting raw materials? You mean there were no laid plans to refine it since 2012

9693 2018-06-04 02:20:36 Wow! @realDonaldTrump is doing what the terrorists have been trying to do all along. Falling out with everyone! This is the end 'super power' . #FYI #kenya is now exporting oil, payments in #euro @SokoAnalyst #us Vs #canada
9694 2018-06-04 02:20:34 So for us it was a can of really nice tuna in olive oil, cherry tomatoes, cheese cubes, goldfish, and broccoli. We would just hang out picnic style and snack. It seemed the stress of eating was taken out of it. And I was less murdery
9695 2018-06-04 02:20:25 Yup- Oil is a major factor to our economic growth. When the barrel of Oil went down, layoffs happened all over the world. In 2 years, this country will be a financial juggernaut from Oil, Steel and etc.
9696 2018-06-04 02:20:25 All that GD fracking for oil in Hawaii sure is fucking up the landscape.

9697 2018-06-04 02:20:22 I'm so disappointed Trudeau bought the Trans Mountain pipeline.  We should be moving away from oil & gas for power.  Apparently people want oil to still be King.
9698 2018-06-04 02:20:06 A really good simple recipe is beet chips. Slice beets thin and coat with olive oil, a little pepper and a little salt and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes at around 350 degrees. Perfect!
9699 2018-06-04 02:19:50 Looks like the oil industry did a great job activating their puppets!  E15 is a choice at the pump that is lower cost, higher octane & cleaner burning.  You can buy all the non oxygenated fuel you want for $4 a gallon.  Go for it!

9703 2018-06-04 02:19:29 I think it’s about expectations. I think the foolish virgins assume they have enough oil—otherwise, they would have brought more. They weren’t prepared for a long wait—but the wise were (Lk 12:38).
9704 2018-06-04 02:19:29 Isn't Pence a favorite of the Kochs? This may be reaching but I'm  wondering if the Koch machine was part of the Rosneft oil deal.

9709 2018-06-04 02:18:51 The problem with liberals is they often don't deal with reality. They have fantasies that they work from, but because they have no experience they have no idea that it is not reality.
9710 2018-06-04 02:18:50 Not that one. Had head gasket issues and coolant in the oil. Going to look at a 2016 tommorow morning. Didn't want that new but I like the reliability and not having to look as hard for a clean one

realize that price increases and oil price are not permanent; they also change and ARE lowered. A big NO to people like Bam :-(
9719 2018-06-04 02:17:59 My wife says to try tea tree oil.
9720 2018-06-04 02:17:48 Yup.. yet so many keep plugged in  to CNN circus. @AC360 biggest disappointment. Like an American hero way he handled Katrina, BP oil spill, other events. When he threw Hillary Clinton under bus for ratings, that was last straw. He has enough clout to have say in his show.

9736 2018-06-04 02:15:36 Business is business. Holding the Canadian Oil Industry to ransom to the tune of $15Billion a year due to price differential was obviously not enough of a sweetener for @realDonaldTrump and the US.
9737 2018-06-04 02:15:08 Tried that for 5 days. Coconut oil and there not coming off. If I knew it would be this difficult I would never of done it. I can’t get them off and not pulling them off as it will rip my eyelashes. They gave me no paperwork on how to remove or what glue they used. Very upset

9745 2018-06-04 02:13:58 Is that the palm-oil surplus partly caused by the subsidies that Suthep's family, big in palm oil, got several years ago when the Democrats were "in power"? :-)
9746 2018-06-04 02:13:51 Nah. I saw before that no records for the James Tristan dox and it was released by Jim (I think) and gave the adress to a homeless shelter (as I mentioned).
Another dox claimed he was the son of a rich oil baron. I heard that one was legit, but I have seen no evidence.

9751 2018-06-04 02:13:24 The question you should ask is, Do global consumers expect special treatment? The oil industry isn't forcing people to buy cars and SUVs and monster pickups. Any move to drive up cost of transportation too high or restrict transportation options will lead to political backlash.
9752 2018-06-04 02:13:17 Or not oil...stupid phone
9753 2018-06-04 02:13:00 Some of the same members of Congress who say that Medicare for all is too expensive had no problem voting for yet another massive increase in military spending. We have to start putting American lives over barrels of oil and fighter jets.
9754 2018-06-04 02:12:46 Principle of communist government states that ' Oli ' has directly proportional relation to ' Oil ' in Nepal . It means ' Oli ' and ' Oil ' are closely related .

9760 2018-06-04 02:11:44 peak liberalism is asking the consumer class to 'go green', recycle, & turn off their lights for an hr each yr to save the planet instead of telling the agricultural/oil industry & multi-billion corporations to cut out 99% of the shit they're pulling every single hr of every day
9761 2018-06-04 02:11:39 Yes, very hot pan with olive oil salt/pepper, thyme, garlic and butter. But it is quick-just over a minute on each side. Note that I over cooked it this time (was in the oven about 10 minutes too long)
9762 2018-06-04 02:11:35 2/But let's respond to your argument that oil consumption has to be zero by 2050. The only way to displace oil is to electrify transportation. Why don't you just argue for enormous R&D in EV battery research/EV subsidies? Then drop in oil demand is demand-driven.
9763 2018-06-04 02:11:32 How does that impact or relate in the smallest, to a proposal to ship 7X’s more toxic and flammable sludge through Metro Vancouve? Are you reading this out of the Pro Oil playbook?

9777 2018-06-04 02:10:23 This is correct.  However, all the other patterns of 2008 are repeating themselves.  Oil & commodities top out mid year, market peaks early in the year.  The signs are there elsewhere

9782 2018-06-04 02:09:17 Ridiculous! The proposal is about increasing oil tanker traffic by 7X’s through Metro Vancouver for no good reason other than to ship oil to Asia.
9783 2018-06-04 02:09:16 1/Well, you can't have it both ways. You can't argue that the oil sands is "dirty oil" with a high carbon-intensity and should be kept in the ground, then argue that if govt and industry take action to reduce carbon-intensity that it doesn't matter anyway.

Jesus says

The Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

9833 2018-06-04 02:01:13 I guess, the demand side needs to free up some barrels for the future. Some sources could be if the Saudi's could free up 0.6 to 0.9 mb/d of oil that they burn for power. But that still requires alot more work to be done. Would be interesting to see what this displacement rate is

9879 2018-06-04 01:54:56 OPEC is also a political organization. It consists of governments that rely on state oil companies for their primary source of revenue. My experience working with many state oil companies is that it is hard to find people more removed from commercial reality.
