2 2019-05-09 23:59:20 Then tell the media that you hope the outreach your team is doing will “pay dividends” like black people are stocks you can get a return on if you pander a little in the right way
3 2019-05-09 23:58:43 I know but how has BTC proved that it’s a non correlated asset ?  No real damage done to stocks and credit trades very well ... seems to me BTC is highly correlated
4 2019-05-09 23:57:37 Berkshire A shares were the rub. My net worth is 4 A-shares. I want to consume 30k a year. This is massively inefficient tax-wise and budget-wise. With Bs (and other stocks writ large) it's not a problem at all.
5 2019-05-09 23:57:32 Sad ? You’re way too kind, Richard : the people responsible for this punitive reaction deserved to be pilloried - or at the very least put in stocks for a day so those jelly sandwiches could be wiped across their arrogant faces . Let me at them ! Shaming a child ???

12 2019-05-09 23:53:33 Viewpoint - how’s the market treating you? If your patient and don’t bail your ok. I seen stocks drop for no reason other than follow the herd mentality. I’ve stayed on course for OMG! over 40 years? I started in 1970 and made adjustments but never bailed even in the worst fall.
