1 2018-03-04 23:57:33 I’m not taking away any of ur rights! You should google what gun control really means! It’s not GUN BAN! It’s not taking away anything from you! It’s increasing background checks, it’s raising the gun age to 21, it’s banning bump stocks! And it’s defeating the NRA! That’s all!

15 2018-03-04 23:41:52 If you look at nominal returns, US stocks outperform European stocks in ~75% of years and when US under-performs it is by small amounts. A lot of the good performance of European stocks held by US investors in periods such as 2003-2007 comes from Euro appreciation against USD.

39 2018-03-04 23:35:35 You're right. We should be looking more at the Gun Owners of America, which rabid-right gun owners prefer over the NRA. 

GOA thinks banning bump stocks "would set an incredibly dangerous precedent which could lead to administrative bans on virtually any type of firearm". 

Huh.

48 2018-03-04 23:23:40 If you are a law abiding citizen then you don't have anything to fear. They are asking for universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and magazine extensions, How does any of that make it harder for a law abiding citizen? #NeverAgain #NeverAgainMSD #MarchForOurLives

54 2018-03-04 23:19:14 I'm sure I probably missed it but what underlying is that based on?

Normally Advance-Decline is a breadth indicator based on Net Advances, which is number of advancing stocks minus the number of declining stocks.

70 2018-03-04 23:07:07 When Trump was elected I heard that stocks would crumble. The opposite happened. Then the tax plan was “Armageddon” as Nancy Pelosi put it. That also turned out to be a lie. Why don’t we let things play out this time.
71 2018-03-04 23:05:57 Shrouds allow for cooling the barrel & may support an accessory like a hand grip. AR-15 rifles permit only one shot per trigger pull like a semi-automatic pistol. Bump stocks (not sticks) accessories use recoil to re-engage a trigger finger quickly - simulating automatic fire.

86 2018-03-04 22:55:20 The value of stocks traded on the Dubai emirate’s main exchange falls to the lowest in almost five months on Thursday.
87 2018-03-04 22:54:18 You realize trump makes his stuff overseas too, right?  He’s a globalist. Look, his own economic team freaked out when he did this...for good reason. You keep talking about globalists, evil corps, while ignoring ichan dumping 31 million in steel stocks.
88 2018-03-04 22:53:23 I feel like we are at the “Meh” stage because prices across the board still seem relatively high. Many stocks that I look at are within 5-10% of 52 week highs and when I look at the chart, it does not look appealing.
89 2018-03-04 22:53:06 Bump stocks should not be available.
90 2018-03-04 22:52:40 My own opinions on the matter are: more scrutiny in background checks, raise the buying age, ban bump stocks, stop selling military-grade weapons. ALSO investing more in mental health resources.
91 2018-03-04 22:50:04 Friday's session was also mixed on Wall Street as US stocks closed well off session lows, mainly helped by a sharp rise in health care shares.
92 2018-03-04 22:49:48 Overall, rather than get whipsawed all over the place, 100% cash is my position of choice at the moment.  Market/sectors/stocks......regardless of how you trade, be VERY SELECTIVE and manage your risk carefully with this high volatility.  2018 is NOT 2017.  Adjust accordingly!
93 2018-03-04 22:49:37 We're really sorry but codes had to be entered by Jan 31, 2018. The promotion has now ended! Specially-marked boxes may still be on shelves while stocks last. 
94 2018-03-04 22:49:12 It’s also unlikely that any of the security are carrying semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks or high capacity magazines.  Law Enforcement might have some folks with semi automatic rifles, but only with the right training.

131 2018-03-04 22:06:20 Human rights like the UN that stocks it’s force with pedos who have immunity to the sexual exploitation of the poor people they are suppose to protect
132 2018-03-04 22:05:10 Corporations are putting the tax cut money straight into their own pockets, buying back stocks. Seems like I heard the Democrats warn of this again and again.
133 2018-03-04 22:05:04 I believe Sainsbury’s are awaiting stocks of water, and ST advised saving some water.
134 2018-03-04 22:05:00 The Dow has fallen for 3 of the last 5 weeks, dropping a total of 2079 points (-7.8%), making this the biggest 5 week fall seen in the 112 weeks since 8 January 2016 #stocks
135 2018-03-04 22:04:55 Not necessarily. Some people see trends, and can read into what's not being said and will dump stock, or buy stock, depending.
I have a coworker who is really good at that and made thousands off penny stocks. Enough in a few months for a down payment on a home.
136 2018-03-04 22:04:51 Here's a binky.

You Assualt toys and bump stocks are going away.

Get over it.
137 2018-03-04 22:04:26 @snapper99man  Using a screener stocks with high strength and strong red signals are more likely to make money shorting them.
138 2018-03-04 22:03:48 I don’t feel like they are a good comparison. I understand why people do, but there was very little behind those .com stocks. The weed companies are real companies that I think will either flourish or be acquired (for the most part)
139 2018-03-04 22:01:41 I just got tax documents for stocks I don't remember buying.  Oops.
140 2018-03-04 22:01:37 Why do people feel the need to waste my time? Like is it fun to make people feel like shit?
141 2018-03-04 21:59:57 @vitaliyk   You know my thoughts about these tariffs.  I have been pro steel stocks since 2013.

There's 14 dead kids and you don't give a shit.
That's pretty damn clear.

Mr. 5million a year, keep my money coming, screw the kids.

We will be banning Assualt rifles, bump stocks, green tipped cop killer bullets, what else?
Give back the Russian money! 

@repdonyoung.
143 2018-03-04 21:57:52 Do you do puts-calls or buy the stocks outright?
144 2018-03-04 21:57:12 Hey, I welcome all feedback pal, I had a private chat with Malcy about oil and a few stocks. It was interesting and I asked would he like to record it. 

I found it useful for the SDX info alone re fiscal terms. I make no apology for it. I have been clear I'm not paid.

148 2018-03-04 21:53:09 We don't use them to slaughter our peers. Only criminals do that. Automatic weapons are already illegal, they're trying to outlaw bump stocks that make weapons automatic. The failure was the FBI and local government.  Why can't you see that
149 2018-03-04 21:52:41 When he sold the stocks it was public knowledge that Trump was going to impose CVD’s on steel. As long as there were articles in the media about it he didn’t violate any laws. At least not this time.
150 2018-03-04 21:52:33 Bump.stocks
151 2018-03-04 21:52:02 way to go back on your promise to ban bump stocks  real man of your word
152 2018-03-04 21:51:59 As someone who invests in stocks for a living she is full of shit. Those charts are ridiculous. A bubble needs history & no major fundamental change. Crypto is brand new and successful. Plenty of new successful ventures have had rapid price increases (see Facebook) as users rose
153 2018-03-04 21:51:27 While the Twitter AIM community is caught up with legal debacles & hourly witch hunts I’ll continue to crack on with discussing stocks I’m interested in, invested in & will welcome any decent conversation as my feed is becoming tiresome this weekend.

157 2018-03-04 21:48:03 Yes and semiautomatic weapons can be converted easily to automatic. Therefore ban all semiautomatic weapons, magazines and bump stocks.
158 2018-03-04 21:46:31 It’s awesome when the article says “we recommend Miracle Gro” and then on the bottom “pay for this thing here that will tell you 10 stocks that are better than Miracle Gro”. Awesome credibility

160 2018-03-04 21:45:10 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Age limit to 21
Universal background checks.

IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? 
CHILD OR ADULT?
THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
161 2018-03-04 21:44:49 Even NRA members want what we are asking for i legislation
take the military weapons off the streets, bump stocks + like as well,
make all sales with background checks, return the mentally unstable
edict blocking their purchased that DT discon't+fund rehab/clinics
162 2018-03-04 21:44:40 Huh? You dont listen. Almost everyone explains themselves. No high capacity magazines/bump stocks. No Mentally Ill people buying. Consistency between retail stores & gun shows, etc. Age 21, another ban on militaristic assault rifles - AR15 must go. Might be more, but good start.
163 2018-03-04 21:44:32 I should of bought stocks in the company that makes tide pod . The pod consumption has to be through the roof.

166 2018-03-04 21:41:24 Agreed, and I would like to think I would have if it were me... but words are easy, heroic action isn’t. If AR-15’s were outlawed along with bump stocks  it would be easier for a policeman armed with a pistol to have a chance. Right now ppl are just mad that he didn’t die too.
167 2018-03-04 21:39:20 82% of stocks are held by 10% of people, so the point of EVERYBODY is moot. Meanwhile, consumers will be paying more for everything, offsetting any of the temporary tax gains. The service industry is the largest sector and they don't get a pension. Social Security.
168 2018-03-04 21:39:10 Bottom line, bump stocks should not be sold anywhere and made illegal. The 2nd Amendment does not include "accessories".

175 2018-03-04 21:34:17 I think most of you are politicizing this far too much. Most people want background checks, no bump stocks, and the most optimistic want to ban assault rifles. It is easy to say "the left" want your guns. But there is a real chance for dialogue here, we all can be winners.

3.A ban on “bump stocks,” a device that enables semi-automatic weapons to fire faster. It can make a legal semiautomatic weapon fire more like an illegal fully automatic gun. Proposal has the most bipartisan support of all gun-control measures.
183 2018-03-04 21:24:12 Good of @POTUS to let Carl Icahn know so he could dump his steel stocks

185 2018-03-04 21:22:27 Alot of little losses can be frustrating, but if you cut your losers fairly quickly and let your winners ride.. one winner can make up for all your losers.  Patience when stocks maintain bullish setups is key, but cut those that breakdown quickly no matter how strongly you feel.

I supported Trump,  but not going to be fed shit from the NRA.
187 2018-03-04 21:19:41 Bump stocks have already been banned and should have already been turned over to the State Police in Massachusetts. Thank you @Emma4Change for working to bring more awareness and hopefully we can get this passed at the federal level. No citizen needs an automatic weapon.

190 2018-03-04 21:17:19 We have enough gun laws. I agree with extended background checks, no bump stocks & mentalhealth database. Weapons aren’t the problem, lack of enforcing existing gun laws, liberal judges and bad parenting are. More laws only punishes law abiding citizens, criminals ignore the law.
191 2018-03-04 21:17:16 Can you imagine what will happen when stocks drop 50% in the next crisis. A 50% haircut to the pensioners will be optimistic.
192 2018-03-04 21:14:41 I find myself having graphic images of tarring and feathering (but not real feathers, fiberglass would be good), putting people in stocks. Very Hawthorne-esque. And then there are the more medieval fantasies......

198 2018-03-04 21:10:27 Get out in front on this send your own bill to Congress to raise minimum age from 18 to 21 to buy rifles and ammunition, eliminate bump stocks and high capacity multi round ammunition magazines.  You don’t hunt animals with assault rifles.

- Backed a Tax bill enriching corporate America and million/billionaires

- Colluded with Russia to steal the election

- Lied endlessly!
202 2018-03-04 21:08:10 Trump must have warned his good billionaire buddy, #CarlIcahn, about the Steel/Aluminum Tariff's because Carl sold off over $31 Million of his stocks a week before #DotardDon announced the Tariff's.  #Crime #JailTime if Mueller can prove it.

212 2018-03-04 21:00:58 I find it a bit difficult to check a stocks volatility/beta value. For norwegian stocks we dont have any good register for this that I'm aware of.
Do you have a quick and easy way to check if a stock is high- or low beta?
I guess you can measure this manually in charts, but...:-/
213 2018-03-04 21:00:13 Children are DEAD and you are making jokes about silencers? There is no sporting purpose for this type of device. Like bump stocks they are designed to make weapons more deadly. You are hurting your argument and providing fuel for the opposition. Not very smart Goebbels in heels.
214 2018-03-04 20:59:38 If they are worried about paying more across the counter then invest in those steel companies stocks and offset it because stock should go thru the roof.
215 2018-03-04 20:58:57 Lmaoo it's you (the Nigerian investor). Who wants to bear it before? . Its an amazing idea cos I remember someone asking for me about buying foreign tech coy stocks. I just want stocks in Google and Amazon. Just those two Lol.

217 2018-03-04 20:57:36 What about the next shooting (and I do hate to write that) if it shows that the weapon and magazines/bum stocks, etc were bought prior to the ban - would you be in favor for politicians then wanting to confiscate those items?  Because it is a acceleration of limitations IMO

222 2018-03-04 20:51:27 Us is worries about stocks.. not housing. Bank of Canada is worried about real estate and consumer debt. Thus both central banks are raising rates. It's not the economy..
223 2018-03-04 20:50:08 I'm not a day trader, but volatility was on my side this past week. One of my stocks leaped up and triggered my covered call grossing $1,200 then proceeded to drop back to where it was.

225 2018-03-04 20:49:19 Yeah after he and Trump told all their buddies so they could dump their steel and aluminum stocks. Well I guess we won't see those food stamp benefit boxes happen - would cost the govt more and people could point directly to Trump as the cause.

244 2018-03-04 20:32:51 it could also be that libs/dems are feigning anti-gun/NRA, just to cause an uptick in gun sales for they own stocks in gun/ammo companies?
245 2018-03-04 20:31:43 Plant…Plant…Plant…The world is experiencing its third consecutive year of declining stocks. As USDA lowers its estimates of world and U.S .ending stocks the new crop December price will push toward the low 80’s. Do not let
the 79-80 cents pass without pricing at least 35-40%.
246 2018-03-04 20:30:44 i found another example - NRA pigs fight to keep bump stocks on the market although the profits off them is minute so, in this case, bump stocks are NRA's buffer to weapons.

249 2018-03-04 20:28:06 Gun stocks are down. Ever since Obama left office and the real threat of illegal government gun banning and confiscation under his administration passed. Obama's anti gun, anti Constitutional, anti American policies helped sell millions of guns like no other time in history. lol
250 2018-03-04 20:27:50 You would think that the left would want to keep these mags and bump stocks considering how bad they think Trump is... he did just mention the desire to be president for life (he was joking) Isn't that situation exactly what the right to bear arms was written For?
251 2018-03-04 20:27:06 No. I don't think @wshed stocks books (happy to be told I'm wrong though). Tourist office next door to them will have it later this week. Stanford's and Waterstones have it now. Thanks.
252 2018-03-04 20:26:37 My 8yo asked me to buy him some stocks. I told him that he had to give me money for the stocks he wants first. He goes in his room and comes back with a $50 bill. 
253 2018-03-04 20:26:17 Great news, I'm certain you'll have fun. If he offers you the stocks you must accept them for what you've done. I'm so exited for you.
254 2018-03-04 20:25:32 It's amazing how much your view changes when an organization has given you 30 million dollars. Not our precious bump stocks! The feeling of an automatic makes me feel like a man! If you take those away it may remind me that I have a small penis!
255 2018-03-04 20:24:43 No bans on bump stocks. No bans on firearms. No bans or no votes for those who steal our rights.
256 2018-03-04 20:24:06 Gotta test it!  $EVIO, $DIGP, $ATTBF.  Not many publicly traded lab stocks...
257 2018-03-04 20:24:02 You asked all the wrong questions, next time ask these

1. Is Goldman Sach interested in $SX?

2. Will Jack Ma be buying $SX stocks?

3. Is $SX going to LSE/NASDAQ/DJIA first?

4. Will Google invest in $SX?

5. When will be $100 stock?

Don’t ask about fundamentals ask his wishes
258 2018-03-04 20:23:09 Bear spray? bump stocks? 
259 2018-03-04 20:21:19 Neither of those things relate to the 2nd Amendment plus you could still have weapons if there were a waiting period, stringent background checks, licensing, insurance, restrictions and no bump stocks, ammunition limits. See how that works?
260 2018-03-04 20:20:45 How about all the mass of union workers, teachers, state employee pensions and 401k participants who OWN stocks as part of their retirement? The sound bite of the populist leftist who unfortunately speaks wonderfully to the ill informed is a form of negligent propaganda.
261 2018-03-04 20:20:28 Jim, what are you doing w/the Boeing stocks knowing that although it's a good stock, that they're 'overvalued?'
262 2018-03-04 20:20:06 That makes sense. If liquidity dries up (and Beaufort locking up a good portion of the market won't help) illiquid stocks with little value will get hammered. The current climate is very different to the madness of December where a bagger a day kept the doctor away.
263 2018-03-04 20:19:13 Reddit will praise larry for taking 13 stocks in the crew battle but the true unsung hero is me not letting void rampage with 3 stocks 
264 2018-03-04 20:19:13 Couple classes of Mods & Stocks 
265 2018-03-04 20:18:42 I could care less about bump stocks and magazines but I'm sure other do.  It's like taking away someone nine iron or driver. I just feel that we are concentrating on the wrong issue. Maybe the fact that the cops didn't properly investigate this kid should be a bigger issue.
266 2018-03-04 20:18:34 Kushner business got loans after WH meetings. Trump's friend Icahn sold stocks hrs before tariffs announced and stock plummeted. Pruitt only flies 1st class, Carson ordered $31k dining set, Shulkin took wife on a trip on tax payer's $, his assistant forged email justifying it.
267 2018-03-04 20:17:46 We expect a steady increase in the value of stocks we buy over a long period of time. But as a 30-something, I hate it when the US stock market takes a leap up like it did last year because it means the shares I buy in my 401K are grossly over-valued.
268 2018-03-04 20:17:34 $SPY Look back at the negative comments Trump made about Biotech, Boeing,  etc., see where I’m going with this......Buy stocks on any dip..
269 2018-03-04 20:17:26 Guys, why is everyone freaked out about @POTUS joking about lifelong appointments? It’s not like his family serves in his @WhiteHouse , or he didn’t divest in his business, or his buddy dumped millions in stocks for the exact item he would tariff...I mean...not third world at all

271 2018-03-04 20:17:05 Great Insight! How do you think the price of crypto's will react? Do you think rising rates will lower the price of cryptos similar to stocks?
272 2018-03-04 20:15:54 Which is why, aim or no aim, bump stocks and extended rounds need to be banned.  CA and other smart states have the right idea.
273 2018-03-04 20:15:08 Stocks on my radar this week

274 2018-03-04 20:12:45 Im not sure the universe owes us this principal. It may come down to whether these products are currencies or stocks. The newbs think these are stocks.
275 2018-03-04 20:11:45 1. WRONG - It's legal tender, you're forced to accept it as currency. You're forced to pay your taxes in that currency.

2. IRRELEVANT - The issue here is wealth acquisition not fiat money. It could be any kind of paper, saying you own land, stocks, etc.
276 2018-03-04 20:11:41 Think when rhetoric dies down (soon), you'll see a nice relief rally. Not sure those stocks have big upside from here near term
277 2018-03-04 20:11:37 @FifeFlyers chins up lads just a wee bump in the road to glory FLYERS will bounce bk stronger WOOOOOOOOO @TheHorseTM @RussMoyer @hutchy071 @nucci39 @PeteyL88 @Heeels @jjorgensen15 @Marrsy33 @C_Schaber @Chadmister10 @jisaacs5 @Josh_Scoon @Stocks_68 @elcreido18 @dirtydc13 
278 2018-03-04 20:11:35 The biggest issue is the 30 round magazine, but the AR is also lighter (designed so soldiers can carry more ammo into battle) and easier to illegally modify (bump stocks, etc).
279 2018-03-04 20:11:01 Exactly. Thank you. So you agree we don't need extended magazines or bump stocks.  See? It's not so hard to agree.
280 2018-03-04 20:10:31 I suppose that's exactly what Icahn did. Buy his stocks BACK after.
281 2018-03-04 20:10:19 doing my “wife’s boyfriend” bit for the king and getting sent to the stocks
282 2018-03-04 20:10:02 @RepMcDermed  I called your office and they said you supported banning bump stocks, yet you voted against it. Care to explain?
283 2018-03-04 20:09:30 Yep, a ban on bump stocks will be their foot in the door for more gun accessories, guns and ammo to be banned down the road.
284 2018-03-04 20:08:38 Cause they just bought MOAR stocks with it! Over 70% allocation of that SWF is in equities. What could go wrong? LMFAO
285 2018-03-04 20:07:09 I cant wait. Beer stocks will sky rocket.
286 2018-03-04 20:06:46 @LutzTory Thanks for the like on my NSAV Tweet...and I'm giving you a "follow" and hope you return the favor!  Cheers in all your stocks!!  longAMFE

288 2018-03-04 20:05:28 5 Rules to Buying Low and Selling High in the Stock Market:
1) Buy Stocks That Are Out-of-Favor
2.) Sell Stocks That Are In-Favor
3.) Ignore Sell-Side Analysts
4.) Overcome Your Emotional Instincts
5.) Base Decisions on Fundamental Data
289 2018-03-04 20:04:35 As part of Fairtrade Fortnight, our Fairtrade Tuck shop will re-open Monday 5 March. Items priced from 25p - £1. While stocks last!
290 2018-03-04 20:04:14 Stocks and bonds?!? More like, "Stocky men" and "Bondage"!!! Am I right !! hahaha 
I miss my family
291 2018-03-04 20:04:09 True, but given the first type 26 wont be ready for at least 5 years, it is a little early to buy stocks of missiles that are going to sit in a bunker somewhere decaying.
292 2018-03-04 20:03:53 Pretty stupid strategy by the NRA. Even if they compromised on a couple common sense laws like banning bump stocks and AR-15s they may even strengthen their organization. Certainly they wouldn’t be getting so much heat.
293 2018-03-04 20:03:47 We need to stop talking about arming teachers and banning bump stocks; it’s an NRA and repub distraction. The focus needs to be on banning assault weapons, large capacity magazines and have expanded background checks. Also start studying gun violence.
The NRA is a terrorist org!
294 2018-03-04 20:03:29 I’m also sticking to the knitting..my holdings are mainly in low PEG/PER stocks exhibiting growth, cash generation & positive outlook.

However, while I retain core holdings, I’ve exited a few trading positions to mitigate risk (see my recent portfolio update tweet). No leverage.
295 2018-03-04 20:02:38 I say we are going to add commodities and truly have a bull market in everything.... no more periods of hard assets verses soft assets. Low rates, bull stocks, bonds and commodities.
296 2018-03-04 20:01:54 They're not going to be as big as industrial stocks. Just watch and dee
297 2018-03-04 20:00:27 At this point I don’t care what movies make these sick amount of money since I’m not getting a cut, maybe time to buy stocks in Disney since everyone seems to want the to rule the industry
298 2018-03-04 19:59:55 Do you support/recommend booking profits and re-entering the stocks during correction? I know one cant time market but still be content n churn 2-3 times a year? Applicable to a few stocks only
299 2018-03-04 19:57:25 A bump stock ban just eliminates bump stocks, after that it’ll be pistol grips, then red dot optics, the list will go on and on.
300 2018-03-04 19:57:04 yea. u knew he was legit when he paused to remember what he put his money towards, then pulled it together by saying stocks
301 2018-03-04 19:57:02 @kylepetty still stocks his fridge with it. The ole 42
302 2018-03-04 19:55:35 He's not supposed to have any stocks.... But you never know with him.

304 2018-03-04 19:54:55 .... bump stocks DO NOT turn rifles into automatic weapons. 
For the love of God and the Bluegrass State do research.
305 2018-03-04 19:54:48 Didn't know that banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines was "taking guns from citizens".
306 2018-03-04 19:52:53 Ever shot a bump stock dawg theyre impractical and inaccurate as fuck. Nobody is using bump stocks in shootings. I just think its funny theyre banning them. Obviously id prefer a HK then a handcrafted peice of shit thats retarded.
307 2018-03-04 19:52:50 Stock buybacks are reinvesting in the company. They aren’t handing the money back to rich people, poor people buy stocks as well. They’re valuable in the long run because they give the company liberty to do what is needed without pressure from stockholders to be all about profit.
308 2018-03-04 19:51:24 I watched. As a fake president pretended to care! He could NOT CARE LESS about gun laws, bump stocks, Parkland, AR's, dead children or anything else but putting on a show for the cameras. I am, once again, disgusted by this sorry sack of shit. #ManWhoHadEverythingButWantedMore
309 2018-03-04 19:50:56 How much does he own in oil and gas stocks?
310 2018-03-04 19:50:53 Bump stocks are only one way to achieve rapid fire results, there are many more the media doesn’t cover. Even if ALL rapid fire accessories are banned, the guns can be modified easily... Face it, the genie is out of the bottle. The Left just wants a foot in. End game is to “ban!”
311 2018-03-04 19:48:28 Feared they'd burn me at the stake.
I watched Flint, Youngstown, Gary die & Pittsburgh turn into a paper town. Companies invested in everything under the sun to grow stocks but not in their own product, plants or workers.
Then I started reading & listening to Chomsky. That was it
312 2018-03-04 19:48:05 5.3) Trump than had lunch with the NRA a second time and after that lunch better background checks and bump stocks all off the table in fact in a tweet he said no gun control! It's not looking like the NRA is out to help on this issue. and why???
313 2018-03-04 19:47:20 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
314 2018-03-04 19:47:14 I watched. As a fake president pretended to care! He could NOT CARE LESS about gun laws, bump stocks, Parkland, AR's, dead children or anything else but putting on a show for the cameras. I am, once again, disgusted by this sorry sack of shit. #ManWhoHadEverythingButWantedMore
315 2018-03-04 19:47:06 @Lawrence @nytimes This past week, the President announced that he will impose blanket tariffs on steel & aluminum imports. It was then reported that Carl Icahn, Trump's close friend days ago sold stocks in those products. Do we know whether he discussed these tariffs with Trump?
316 2018-03-04 19:46:27 I watched. As a fake president pretended to care! He could NOT CARE LESS about gun laws, bump stocks, Parkland, AR's, dead children or anything else but putting on a show for the cameras. I am, once again, disgusted by this sorry sack of shit. #ManWhoHadEverythingButWantedMore
317 2018-03-04 19:45:18 ESPECIALLY when it’s ALL of it!   Omg.  Foolish to think it’s NOT a concern. Lmao.  How many stock trades you done in your life ?  Prob not a lot.  Bc you have no idea what you are talking about concerning insider sales and how stocks act after. Ur giving me eye cancer
318 2018-03-04 19:44:35 5.2) Which is not even close to the truth. As of current events Trump had said he wants better background checks, make bump stocks illegal and wanted to change the age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21. He then had lunch with the NRA after that lunch he dropped the age limit rule
319 2018-03-04 19:43:23  These were old, vintage stocks that were sitting in warehouses
 He's a wonderful person with a terrible illness
320 2018-03-04 19:43:23 Afraid not, Dad.  I did a post on selling Put options, but I haven't done anything on shorting stocks (not something I do in my portfolio, tho I have bought some inverse ETF's).
321 2018-03-04 19:43:10 OMG. “Whether he is or is not invested should not be a concern”.   You need to go read. ALOT about how stocks act when “insiders sell”.  It’s a “tell”. They know something you don’t. It’s of the BIGGEST concern when - no skin in game. THE BIGGEST!  based on history. Look it up

331 2018-03-04 19:38:09 Let me correct this Trump supported auto-correct. I said "Well ONE of @realDonaldTrump cronies did a "pump & dump" w/ his steel stocks last week B4 @realDonaldTrump announced the new tariffs. How's that 4 a good morning wake up".
332 2018-03-04 19:37:58 Crash, tumbled, nosedived, all appropriate words for the rapid and substantial drop in the stocks. You getting triggered by certain words is not an argument.
333 2018-03-04 19:37:47 I suppose we should see how the market takes your threats, or should we just check what stocks Carl Icahn sold last week.
334 2018-03-04 19:36:27 We need some forms of gun control. I'm not saying take peoples guns away, but maybe start with assault weapons needing an extensive background check? Get rid of bumper stocks and high capacity magazines?

slow, conservative. Others are jumpy, nervous, tense. Some of them I
found easy to predict. They were consistent in their moves, logical in
their behavior. They were like dependable friends."

347 2018-03-04 19:29:24 I don’t get the fight to oppose banning the bump stocks since they are clearly an external mod to allow a ROF nearly equal to an auto or burst fire weapon which are specifically regulated already.
348 2018-03-04 19:29:00 That's the biggest problem with the @NRA, they don't even want to discuss a compromise. What started as a hunting and training group turned into money, money, money. Let's start with getting rid of assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
349 2018-03-04 19:28:52 Agreed but if you look at their 52 week and history you’ll see they usually spike and then fall again so you must be ready to pull out when the going is good. Everyone knows tech stocks are hard to keep on a plateau so I would just monitor it a lot.
350 2018-03-04 19:28:45 Yep!

I would never pay any attention to those paid pumpers however I fear someone might follow their 10 tweet threads of pumping ending with 3 character imo in the last tweet. 

Usually garbage products are mktd by tele mkt co - same way garbage stocks promoted thru DMs.
351 2018-03-04 19:26:37 What's the company's policy about retailers nonmoving stocks@Aircel
352 2018-03-04 19:26:00 Just like Wall Street- watch a money show and individuals comment about stocks after they move their clients and then 2 weeks later they say the opposite about the same stock - before people comment or vote - they need to disclose their positions.
353 2018-03-04 19:25:56 To many on Wall Street bot conpanies anda stocks are seen only as raw materials  for trades
354 2018-03-04 19:25:08 I suppose. I didn't take it as an exhaustive report so much as I found it interesting how certain cards performed vs. certain stocks. It may not have presented all variables but his general point was that cards are a worthwhile investment, which I would agree with.
355 2018-03-04 19:24:05 I was offered this role not too long ago - denied without thinking twice. This is not the way to go to build an image. Quick money is destructive, especially at the cost of promoting shady stocks which leaves investors burnt at the end.
356 2018-03-04 19:23:25 We should check to see if Ross and Trump shorted steel and aluminum futures, Boeing, and metals company stocks.
357 2018-03-04 19:22:14 Might support it if it could be in stocks (pillory) with a throwing area
358 2018-03-04 19:22:12 Not even if the trading stocks & crypto currencies!??? 
359 2018-03-04 19:22:11 So what are you blaming for the depression of wild stocks in areas with no fish farms...like the north coast? What about mid coast stocks? Your argument is specious...stocks all over west coast not doing well. Not farms fault
360 2018-03-04 19:22:04 If your side considers giving up bump stocks a big sacrifice, It's going to be difficult to make any progress.
361 2018-03-04 19:21:25 How about the Vegas shooter? Was it someone else's fault that assault-style rifles and bump stocks were so easy for him to procure? Or are you going to pass the buck on that too?
362 2018-03-04 19:21:20 I don't feel bad, he's cost me far too many stocks in Smash.
363 2018-03-04 19:18:58 When a podcast has you checking stocks and now you feel like you’re back in your senior year of high school 
364 2018-03-04 19:18:58 NRA running scared. They are going to lose their assault weapons.  Have to get their $$$$$$ out of OUR government too.  Washington State has banned bump stocks.
365 2018-03-04 19:18:49 K i shall rephrase. Ignore advice regarding stocks on twitter. No real way of vetting the info, knowing who it’s coming from or knowing who it was received from. Stock tweeters are always saying “imo”, but their humble opinions never seem to pan out
366 2018-03-04 19:17:50 @realDonaldTrump @nra @waynelapierrejr add a 500% tax to all AR15s M16s AK47s clips magazines and bump stocks 
367 2018-03-04 19:16:55 The Forbes article didn’t account for fees and a much lower cap gain tax on stocks (among other issues). It was one of the worst hobby articles in years. Doesn’t help the pro card crowd.
368 2018-03-04 19:16:49 Too bad you were nowhere near as funny as Obama. And everything you’re doing is to enrich yourself and your cronies. Like Carl I, who sold off stocks that dropped when you announced your stupid tariff.
369 2018-03-04 19:16:26 TouchTunes stocks music on a bit of a random basis. We don't have much control over it. AMI jukes stock all of our catalog.

373 2018-03-04 19:14:41 Now that stocks have been replenished, it is time for a cuppa and a well deserved snack! The Hovel kettle is on, feel free to join me!
374 2018-03-04 19:14:35 I'm not saying we have to change it, but it is something that we should consider. Why not test removing bump-stocks from the market legally and see what happens after that?

383 2018-03-04 19:10:14 Say something remotely negative, yet real about certain stocks and be prepared to be cyber bullied. The block button helps. In some cases, its cult like followings, and in some cases its paid promoters, and in many cases its both.

394 2018-03-04 19:04:58 (1) Let’s say lawmakers all agree to ban “assault weapons”, close the “gun show loophole”, strengthen background checks, fix the issue of mentally ill people having firearms, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, get violence out of movies and games....

398 2018-03-04 19:02:43 So when stocks are up a year after Obama it’s because of Obama?

400 2018-03-04 19:01:49 Please ban bump stocks as if i cant make it automatic with a screwdriver, a drill, and a dremel.
401 2018-03-04 19:00:38 What's an assault rifle? That term is made up to make guns sound like they are only used for assaulting others which isn't the case at all. You don't need a bump stock to bump fire a weapon. I was doing it long before bump stocks were commonly known. Banning them dies nothing.

405 2018-03-04 18:58:24 lol, when Stocks are up it’s because of Obama and when it’s down it’s because of Trump. Lol. That explains why Hillary blamed Lincoln for her emails.
406 2018-03-04 18:58:09 Question:   How many years experience do you have with GANN squares or Tom DeMark?  You probably have very little idea how to use those or even what I’m talking about. 15years experience with those 2 methods here. 1,000’s of stocks used. Not worried about the bears.
407 2018-03-04 18:57:54 This morning I bought 2 stocks in @AMCTheatres just now my 26 year old cousin and I just blew raspberries at each other for a full breathe it lasted about 15 whole seconds....I think I have life figured out.
408 2018-03-04 18:57:49 I'm just saying I wouldn't be quick to snap up stocks just yet. I would only buy at either a retest of 200ma area or if it got over 25310 really. Anything in between will be extremely volitle and I expect gold to rally and get over $1365 only a break of $1285 would change my mind
409 2018-03-04 18:55:51 I wonder if @TedNugent has responded to @realDonaldTrump calling to take guns first, due process later or banning bump stocks and age restrictions. #cult45
410 2018-03-04 18:54:53 I’ve known Trick for a year. I’ve watched them build this product. Hundreds of hours fine tuning these scanners. This doesn’t return hundreds of stocks you have to wade through. It returns 5 to 10 trades that you can take any one of them and make $.

412 2018-03-04 18:54:28 Over the past twelve months or so I’ve been consciously investing in stocks with dividends as there’s a bit more security with them in down times while at the same time the dividends produce a cash pile. I’m also trading a whole lot less.
413 2018-03-04 18:54:09 I know a family whose legacy includes a banker who borrowed on clients'/friends' accounts to invest in stocks for himself, was exposed in the '29 crash, & served with Capone at Atlanta St. Penn.  They were punished with prison sentences, as should happen in this case to many.

417 2018-03-04 18:49:52 Okay, we can have a statue of Thatcher.

But since everyone’s going to be throwing things at it, she should be in the stocks.
418 2018-03-04 18:47:55 Talk about fools, look at these 3 right here. Yes bump stocks should be illegal. They could turn any semi auto gun to perform like automatic. Having fired both an AR-15 and other semi auto rifles, there is zero difference between the two. Any of you actually fire a gun before?
419 2018-03-04 18:47:51 It’s always convenient to try to make this about the 2nd Amendment! Banning bump stocks banning these weapons of war has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment! The 2nd amendment is not sacrosanct & it’s not superior to every other amendment!
420 2018-03-04 18:47:33 Lets stick on the topics of gun because there's nothing comparable to guns that are legal and made for killing people. (No, cars are not made for killing people). Say bump stocks are now illegal: It doesn't affect the sales of guns much and it stops semi-auto becoming fully auto

426 2018-03-04 18:40:58 There is nothing stopping anyone from making a pipe bomb. It is illegal though. Semi-automatic guns and bump stocks are not illegal, any person could walk into a store and buy a semi automatic gun, a bump stock and loads of ammo no problem. Could they do that with pipe bombs? No.
427 2018-03-04 18:40:36 There are four main ways Berkshire can use its cash. It could acquire a large company (or several), purchase common stocks of other companies, buy back its own shares, or pay a dividend to shareholders.

430 2018-03-04 18:39:55 Bought by who and why? Most data implies the reason to own stocks - growing earnings - turned. Did charts predict 2008? You may be right but will you gamble on that yourself?
431 2018-03-04 18:39:43 This is the Enron of social media stocks how is a company worth 25 billion when they lost 500 million plus the same year that evaluation was given. also lost 350 million this year but hey  Getting better by 2025 they will be able to balance their books

434 2018-03-04 18:38:26 The deflationary Ds (debt, demography, disruptive technology, disinvestment) are a long term trend. Small countertrends are still possible however given current negative feedback loop lower bonds <> lower stocks and the positioning it seems we are close to the top in rates.

439 2018-03-04 18:35:45 wrong... add hi capacity mags. It's an assault rifle, it has the capacity to kill a lot of people in short order...even worse with bump stocks....what is with you gun crazy people that you can't give it up?
440 2018-03-04 18:35:18 What do you have evidence for? That the tariffs will work, despite all evidence to the contrary? That the dollar isn't weakening? That Trump didn't just send the stocks into a tailspin? That his policies won't add trillions to the debt? Show me then.
441 2018-03-04 18:34:54 I think lots of “safe” large caps carry lots of debt, have silly ratings and are at risk of disintermediation. Bunzl /WPP for example. I am certain large does not equate to safe. I think tech stocks. High gross margin, recurring revenues, good viability are safer than large cap.
442 2018-03-04 18:34:47 Letting all your buddies know what stocks too sell, before you scew the people who voted for. Class act!
443 2018-03-04 18:34:14 Actually foreign investors own about 28% of US stocks. 53% of all Americans own no stocks at all, including those in retirement plans & IRAs.
444 2018-03-04 18:34:04 Yes bump stocks are legal, but when you use it, you are basically turning a semiautomatic into a fully automatic (it enables you to empty an entire clip with one trigger). Automatic weapons are illegal. Bump stocks are a loophole to the restriction on automatic weapons.
445 2018-03-04 18:33:29 What an utter prat.Should be put in the stocks....
446 2018-03-04 18:33:01 Let’s keep our guns. Just dial it back a notch, Aight???? No bump stocks, no ghost guns, no AR-15’s at Kroger’s. Register guns like cars.

448 2018-03-04 18:29:26 I don't understand bump stocks. They take something (semi-auto) that is normally legal and make it into something (fully-auto) which is normally illegal. Doh!
449 2018-03-04 18:29:18 In these turbulent times, are any investors increasing their % allocation to larger cap stocks over small caps?

455 2018-03-04 18:25:31 Retweeted from Judd Legum:
 “Wow, Trump confidant Carl Icahn is such a LUCKY GUY. 
  Right before Trump announces a steel tariff that tanks manufacturing  stocks, he dumped 1 MILLION SHARES of the one of the companies that was  hardest hit. 
 Such a fortunate coincidence.”
456 2018-03-04 18:24:38 Ok but at one point he said something along the lines “as for getting 7% in stocks, please show me where”.  I thought he was possibly being sincere.

460 2018-03-04 18:23:35 Just move 40% of 401k out of stocks, bonds to cash. This should be tipping point. High inflation without wage growth. Will move more out during week. Never ever all at once.

463 2018-03-04 18:16:59 @Vanguard_Group Dump gun stocks from mutual funds. Why be the 2nd largest shareholder for assault rifle makers? Supporting mass murder is unpopular... Investors with #Vanguard want YOU to divest from gun stocks NOW!

468 2018-03-04 18:13:49 Guess they will leave all of it here. They can sleep in only in one bed eat one lunch, the take nothing more out of society what they can personally use. The money they got is in investments.. buildings, banks, stocks bonds...their money can be borrowed...used for new businessess
469 2018-03-04 18:13:19 I think if your side offered concealed carry reciprocity in exchange for bump stocks for instance, there would actually be a conversation. But most of the time there is nothing offered in exchange, so it’s not a compromise.
470 2018-03-04 18:13:01 The SEC will most likely not release anything.  When you look back at most other stocks this was done to, you will see they were per scam and $PDXP is not.

One can bump fire with just their fingers BTW, don't need a bump stock, although it helps. Can ban the stocks but ban fingers?  With 3D printers, ppl can make those at home as well.
473 2018-03-04 18:11:06 Tbf I personally feel like it’s a lot more like gambling than anything else it gets called. But if we label Btc as gambling then we must also label the entire housing and stocks market as gambling too.

475 2018-03-04 18:10:31 according to the NRA, if a few thousand people per year have to die to preserve Bubba's right to own a few assault rifles and "bump stocks" well, that's just to damn bad...As long as you kill with a gun, "..you're A-OK with the NRA!!"
476 2018-03-04 18:09:42 If it works, don't fix it. Just because your stocks and friends would benefit from a change that would be evidence of corruption.

478 2018-03-04 18:09:27 They attribute any white shooter to mental health issues. Well, here’s the perfect example. How can anyone sanely put bump stocks above lives? And this is someone at the helm of the NRA.
479 2018-03-04 18:06:54 CAUTION WITH STOCKS?  Watch 3/18 & 4/18 economic reports for economic slowdown.  While GOP PAC will be supporting stock market until 11/18 elections to help GOP win, they may not be successful if there is a trade war, Trump impeachment etc.  You can stand aside in troubled times

How many besides Trump advisor Icahn dumped their stocks just before news? Poor Martha Stewart went to prison!
486 2018-03-04 18:03:51 v pulce roku 2016 jsem to vnimal tak, ze by cnb trvalo prilis dlouho, nez by uzavreli mezeru realneho kurzu pres vyssi inflaci - a bylo tam stale riziko toho, ze priliv spekulativnich penez si vynuti predcasny exit a-la CHF, na ktery by se cesky korporatni sektor nestihl zajistit
487 2018-03-04 18:03:35 again, someone sold a billion XRP at ATH - In stock market if insiders sell a big chunk of stocks, it is an obvious sign of a down trend. Unfortunately we didnt catch it

489 2018-03-04 18:02:36 Rob can you address any of the concerns that we put on here? Russian sanctions?? AR-15’s and bump stocks? Assuring us that our senator makes decisions independent of the NRA?? Seriously, you get asked all day, everyday on here and just ignore it.
490 2018-03-04 18:01:47 Fair cop, distributions is a better term.

But why not? If you want the money pay the dividend tax. 

Also allot of these funds are held by pension funds and private investers, stocks and shares isas and the like.

493 2018-03-04 17:59:42 Ask your friend again. He might have changed his view now recommending to bet on virgin stock like BJP ( multibagger) rather than widow stocks (-ve returns), whom no one is ready to touch. 
494 2018-03-04 17:59:14 Cult coins/stocks have a bigger chance of a mass exodus. I’d rather have under the radar money. Not ones that need pumping all over s media.

502 2018-03-04 17:54:20 There is a good argument made by the mass murderers for keeping bump stocks.

504 2018-03-04 17:51:31 There are millions and millions who would rather leave with no deal, it's only the PM and politicians that want a deal. There was no deal in the referendum we the majority of the public voted to leave, close our borders and regain all fishing zones to protect fish stocks.
505 2018-03-04 17:51:18 Haydn, Maia and I went today they were really appreciative as they have missed 3 collection days and stocks running really low try and get along if you can.

507 2018-03-04 17:49:05 School meals will be operational tomorrow but there may be a more limited choice.  Stocks at local stores may also be limited for those pupils who normally go out for lunch. For this reason pupils may wish to consider bringing a packed lunch tomorrow.

I assume that erosion happens even when I'm not noticing it. Yikes.
513 2018-03-04 17:46:02 @LBC should put all your eggs in one basket, when interest rates are low shares rise in value, so should of been investing in stocks
514 2018-03-04 17:45:55 I will assume that the stock went down because he was selling his large percentage.  Big trader's like Carl Icon usually don't sell small positions. They usually sell their entire 20% - 30% stake in company shares...

547 2018-03-04 17:18:33 Bump stocks allow a semiautomatic weapon to mimic the firing power of a fully automatic weapon, thus circumventing our laws which prohibit civilians from owning automatic weapons. No one needs a bump stock for hunting & self defence.

555 2018-03-04 17:13:46 Yes, they are. $BAC remains prime, with secondary of $JPM.  The brokerage stocks - such as $SCHW, $CME, and $AMTD are increasingly 'interesting' as the equity/capital markets are set to remain volatile for much of the year.  

... and of course, higher rates ARE bullish for fins

558 2018-03-04 17:12:42 And when we find out that Icahn maximized his profits from his putative knowledge by selling his billions in other manufacturing stocks and buying steel & aluminum stocks, it will be proof that he is this type of skinflint, too. Failing that, “pragmatic and smart” is a better fit
559 2018-03-04 17:12:20 I never had any luck with trailing stops, so I stopped using them.  The market tends to "flash" often, even on individual equities.  Getting stopped out has cost me quite a bit.  Only hold stocks that you'd be willing to buy more when there is a flash sell-off.

561 2018-03-04 17:11:20 Regulating and banning are not the same thing. The @NRA is against banning bump stocks. They're not against regulating bump stocks and they're not against all firearm regulations. Which is why we need to also be @GunOwners of America members as well.
562 2018-03-04 17:10:51 I want the max version with bump stocks
563 2018-03-04 17:10:16 Thank you. That is interesting about the restriction of rounds. Unrelated or related question...what is your take as a hunter with bump stocks? I have read many in the know (seems like you fit this bill) feel they make the gun inaccurate. If so, why are around in the first place?

570 2018-03-04 17:07:10 You’re seriously blaming Trudeau for Trump applying tariffs? How delusional is that? Trump didn’t even consult his own party. This is going to hurt American businesses also. Hence his advisor Icahn selling millions in steel stocks a few days before he did this.
571 2018-03-04 17:06:59 @SenAngusKing  about the way they want things done. Bann all military type assault rifles, larger capacity ammo cartridges, and bump stocks. There are many in the Rep. side and Joe Manchin (D) could be more. who have completely MISSED, what ...

575 2018-03-04 17:03:36 As an Ranger Army vet who was the small arms spec on our team - I'm assuming I know a bit. Special stocks installed to make any weapon nearly automatic should be illegal - as are auto rifles. And, I'm not talking about machine guns.

579 2018-03-04 17:01:45 Unemployment was on downward trend for years due to Obama admin. Stocks on upward trend also due to Obama. Military has enough toys. Tax cuts have been proven to be worth peanuts to average American vs. benefits to corporations and top 1%. Trump policies more harmful to country.
580 2018-03-04 17:01:38 It is the NRA that blocks universal background checks, raising the age to 21, limits on magazine, banning bump stocks etc. so yes , I do blame the NRA. Most gun owners are in favor of these changes but the NRA buys the politicians that are supposed to represent us. Follow the $$$

584 2018-03-04 16:59:55 Trade war will hit stocks hard. Will it actually occur? Even the uncertainty will likely cause significant volatility. Investors should brace themselves & prepare for the worst. Keep in mind: this too will pass.
585 2018-03-04 16:59:11 @TheView Watched Meghan McCain talk about the @NRA & the fact that SHE Supports them & is a Member on "This Week".  She also would not talk about Banning Bump Stocks.

589 2018-03-04 16:55:59 There will always be some % of people who active manage and own individual stocks. Don't worry markets are organic living things and will balance in time the articles predicting doom and gloom are hyperbole.
590 2018-03-04 16:55:27 One thing I learned last year (or relearned after the pavlovian conditioning of a crazy bull market) you have to be able to sell stocks you love.
591 2018-03-04 16:55:02 Thinking in investing into stocks soon.. 
592 2018-03-04 16:53:27 well as u know the gun show loophole is supposed 2 b addressed in the new bill that trump spoke about but apparently now he’s back tracking.  but i did see a particular gun show will no longer sell or raffle off assaults weapons or bump stocks (couldnt believe they raffle off)
593 2018-03-04 16:52:52 Terrible Reality. Belt loop. You don't need a bump stock to automatically shoot off continuous bullets. You only need the bump and a strike on the trigger. There's dozens of vids on YouTube. Bump stocks just make it easy peasy micro peen cool. Welcome back "thoughts & prayers"
594 2018-03-04 16:52:11 This is the time to realize the value of quality. 
All the high flying doubtful names are getting a good thrash from market while quality is hardly down. 

For ex. our Make Me Rich stocks are almost there where it was before the fall.
595 2018-03-04 16:51:44 I know that we will ban Assault Weapons when we take back Congress this year, outlaw bump stocks, and pass other common sense gun reform. The NRA would like for you to believe that the 2nd Amendment gives you carte blanche on weaponry and that weapons make us safer. They don't.
596 2018-03-04 16:51:43 I’m sure banning bump stocks will make a HUGE impact when it was used in how many mass shootings? And to your Obama point yes he could have done more and so could EVERY FORMER PRESIDENT

604 2018-03-04 16:46:22 We know nothing about the Vegas Shooting. Why would shooter need 19 firearms? Raised chance of being discovered greatly.  How many guns had bump stocks? Did he use guns w/bump stocks? If so,did any guns jam do to more rapid fire? Why did shooter only shoot for about 10 min?
605 2018-03-04 16:45:36 what r all the stocks to buy.
606 2018-03-04 16:45:08 I d not blame them. They answer to incentive they have. Central bank cheap money is the culprit. We have grandmas in the 80s piling on stocks in Europe because they cannot get returns for their savings by buying bunds. Are grandmas bad people? It's all about the "hunt for yield".
607 2018-03-04 16:44:53 White cishet men in congress are trying to regulate my body and don't know a god damn thing about, so why tf does this group need to know the exact specific language/words on whether a silencer is a misnomer or what exactly bumped stocks are? Gtfoh
608 2018-03-04 16:44:22 Common ground that >80% Americans support;

4. Ban semi-automatic conversions (ie Bump stocks)

To je něco jiného jako krádeže v právním státě. Je namístě, že po cca 50 letech, demokratická vláda majetek církvím vrací bez zdanění.

614 2018-03-04 16:38:54 I’m totally fine with banning bump stocks. They’re useless other than just wanting to go shoot the heck out of a gun in the middle of a field somewhere, but definitely not a “side” issue. If you don’t understand what a gun is capable of on it’s own, you don’t understand the gun.

616 2018-03-04 16:38:00 Any politician that refuses to BAN military grade weapons including Mr. Weaver is co-signing the next mass slaughter. ONLY banning bump stocks is a joke! @WMBDNews
617 2018-03-04 16:37:51 Where's your promised Executive Order banning bump stocks as promised 1 1/2 weeks ago.  #GunContolNow #banbumpstocks
618 2018-03-04 16:37:02 Sorry to hear that Andrea. Hopefully new stocks will be in store very soon.
619 2018-03-04 16:36:44 Notice how they haven't done anything about guns or even the bump stocks Chump was going to "write out"

They're not going to, either
620 2018-03-04 16:34:51 And if your advisor picks stocks for anything other than legal return, you should fire them as well
621 2018-03-04 16:34:48 President Trump can you call me at 555-5555 I want to know what other tariffs you're doing so I can make sure I can sell certain stocks and buy other stocks
622 2018-03-04 16:34:24 One thing I want people to understand about the plays that I post. 
I am not looking for long term holds or growth stocks.
I am putting up plays that I feel have a probability of jumping 5-20%. Some maybe more...
But remember to take profits because greedy pigs get slaughtered.
623 2018-03-04 16:33:49 it was killed b overfishing and greed
it was quotas that saved the stocks
624 2018-03-04 16:33:29 Yeah that could fuck the stocks up!
625 2018-03-04 16:33:27 If your advisor picks stocks without examining the company fundamentals, you need to fire them. They are not taking care of you.
626 2018-03-04 16:33:26 The President has done the exact opposite, even basic gun control policies like raising the age to purchase military style assault weapons was "too much." In fact, the President won't even ban bump stocks thanks to the shitty NRA's influence. That's scarier!
627 2018-03-04 16:33:18 Votes count today, tomorrow & far into the future.  Who is voted in has consequences.  Will they be uplifting & moral or will your vote make us laughing stocks of other countries.  Will you be allowed to better yourselves economically, emotionally with pride, or will you be used
628 2018-03-04 16:31:18 The NRA has nothing to do with it. The bill presented was far too vague and banned a lot more than just bump stocks. That’s why it was shot down.

634 2018-03-04 16:28:01 Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines. Go to universal background checks and waiting periods. Oh...and a federal buy back program.

639 2018-03-04 16:19:11 @ThisWeekABC Meghan McCain, it’s very disappointing that you cant agree on national TV that you aren’t for extended background checks, or say you’re for banning bump stocks. You may think you are serving the public. You’re not.
640 2018-03-04 16:18:51 Ima gts just like I did Friday. Wanna talk abt stocks all hour
641 2018-03-04 16:18:40 Why isn't Drumpf being prosecuted for 'insider trading' in regard to his good buddy (Icahn) selling stocks before the trade announcement? How is it possible that this has disappeared from the news????? CAN ANYONE ANSWER ME???? WTF???
642 2018-03-04 16:17:47 You're lying. Bump stocks do not convert semi-auto to full auto.

#gunsense is nonsense
#guncontrol is tyranny
643 2018-03-04 16:15:42 Year. Stocks gonna definitely drop. I wasn’t convinced at first cause I really had faith but I was blinded by the so call opportunity. And it’s the first year so it’s not gonna go smooth. But the dishonesty I can’t do. So I’m not protesting for everyone to stop playing the game

648 2018-03-04 16:12:12 Josh Bolten and others understand our economy oh too well. In 08' he and his buddies short sold Goldman Sachs and other bank stocks ahead of the mortgage collapse. Coincidence? Good forsight ? Nahh
649 2018-03-04 16:11:37 Another thing to keep in mind is that I am only playing these plays for 5-20% bounces. Not LT investments or growth stocks.
650 2018-03-04 16:10:20 It's based on the same way I do it for stocks that I trade; proximity to resistance vs support.

652 2018-03-04 16:09:53 Speaking #AsAGunOwner I don't want my guns taken away, they are for protection, but I don't own assault rifles, bump stocks or any semi-automatic weapons.  I want protection against these weapons by Congress in the form of sensible gun legislation.

654 2018-03-04 16:07:03 It's not just Dems.  I believe in responsible gun ownership.  I'm against military style rifles, bumps stocks, large capacity magazines, and people with domestic violence and mental health backgrounds getting a gun.  I am NOT a member of the NRA. like 300 million other Americans.
655 2018-03-04 16:06:47 I am not sure that is true, buffer stocks in longer supply chains create resilience. Not sure if any shops ran out of bananas or pineapples?
656 2018-03-04 16:06:27 Funny that a former advisor of yours, dumped his stocks before you announced these tariffs.
Obviously, he has insider information.
I honestly believe you have the most corrupt administration in the history of this country
657 2018-03-04 16:06:21 Yes, Hollyweird would have fit! Talk is cheap, Mr. President, & you need to demonstrate by your actions that you intended to keep your campaign promises to uphold the Second Amendment rights of US Citizens and stop capitulating to the leftists on bump stocks & other such matters.
658 2018-03-04 16:06:14 Why do people go buy everything that’s not important mf be having a million outfits 12 cars no house no health insurance (Medicaid don’t count) no 401k no stocks, bonds, trust, pension, IRA, ect y’all chasing a whole kid  you’ll learn 10 years from now Hahahaha
659 2018-03-04 16:05:59 Absolutely!!! When I was in 1 grade we were given savings accounts bank books. In 6th grade we learned to read the Stock Page of the NY Times, we tracked stocks for a semester and were brought to Wall Street. The only loan I ever took was for my home.
660 2018-03-04 16:05:53 Stocks markets are little more than indicators. What scares me is the debt market, not the equity.

Brilliant. (Now with bump stocks)
662 2018-03-04 16:03:53 Why do you speak on a subject you know nothing about? Do you even know what bump stock is? It's obviously jargon to you. Those that know about bump stocks know how hard they're to use and how inaccurate they're to use. You politicians are too funny!
663 2018-03-04 16:02:39 Could Trump be involved in insider trading with steel stocks? It looks like it. Stay tuned.
664 2018-03-04 16:02:28 How can someone dump millions of steel stocks like you claim. Did you mean millions of dollars worth of shares? Do you know the difference? Are u a real professor? 

He dumped one stock, and did so on 2/12 after a JPMorgan analyst lowered his target on 2/12, unrelated to tariffs!
665 2018-03-04 16:02:19 Stocks like FDC in pharma never moved to more than 10-20 RS but all of a sudden jumped 3 times.
Great business often test your patience big time.

666 2018-03-04 16:02:16 ...if this mess here isn't getting crazier by the minute once again, y'all need to stop trying to sway folks away from the real issues, 1.Mental illness 2. Assault rifles, instead y'all trying to make them focus on bump stocks and 21yrs.of age really
667 2018-03-04 16:02:06 I wish I was your age with this mentality. Get passed the materialistic phase and focus on stocks and bonds and buying property and investing and creating a savings and a solid foundation. Life comes at you fast littler brother.
668 2018-03-04 16:01:56 Follow the money. What companies does he own, stocks, or bribes (on alright, donations) tells him to say this.
669 2018-03-04 16:00:34 Remember 3 years is one small part of a bull phase. Protecting from the downside at least as important as picking gr8 stocks.

678 2018-03-04 15:55:02 Common sense logic: 
India -> developing country
Infrastructure requirements are 
Steel/aluminium requirements will 
How can these stocks not do well in the next 2-3 years provided they have good corporate governance and business model?
679 2018-03-04 15:54:46 Parents have a Responsibility, and must take it, You have a responsibility but you will not take it. The Parkdale Movement asked for complete ban on  all military assault weapons like the AR 15, large capacity ammunition cartridges and bump stocks. ......
680 2018-03-04 15:54:13 Agree.  People talk about concentrated investing but I have met almost no one who actually does it (less than 1 percent of people I know who hold themselves out as investors).  As Buffett has said, with $1 Mn dollars he would own 4 stocks.
 Managing 100 Mn, 80% would be in top 5.
681 2018-03-04 15:54:11 
682 2018-03-04 15:53:44 "This isn't about fully automatic rifles"  but "you can talk about bump stocks?"

685 2018-03-04 15:51:57 @SundayFutures POTUS should regulate bump stocks NOT BAN THEM. I'm 70 yr old vet w/2 Honorable Discharges, an NRA Cert Instructor & father of a Fed. LEO. I can't afford $30-40 thousand $ for a class 3 weapon. Regulate so I can afford B Stocks, but so the wrong ppl can't get them

Just to be fair, here's some counterpoints that most reasonable Republicans believe, despite still having fanatics on both sides.

1. Women's right to choose.
2. Fuck who you want.
3. Marry who you want.
4. Bump stocks aren't #2A.
687 2018-03-04 15:51:51 So... is the age for guns raised to 21?
Automatic weapons banned?
Bump stocks banned?

695 2018-03-04 15:46:44 @HouseDemocrats & @SenateDems pass comprehensive background checks Banning of the sale or possession of Bump Stocks and a buyback provision for them and raising the age of buying assault weapons to 21. These are proposals that should pass with @GOP support.
696 2018-03-04 15:46:40 As compare to liquidity in the market ,stocks are still cheap.People will keep on buying,making stocks more expensive&will not stop until crash

698 2018-03-04 15:46:15 Something really is wiong with you, the NRA has warped your brain. I made it clear Bump stocks and semi automatic weapons should be band. What part of that don't you understand? You made it clear you disagree so what is the problem?
699 2018-03-04 15:45:06 @CongMikeSimpson 2nd Amndmnt ws nt intended to allow people to arm themselves to shoot innocent people! We r a nation of guns. Ban assault weapons except 4 those needed by military & police; ban bump stocks; allow NFAct to registr firearms, firearms owners, firearms transactions
700 2018-03-04 15:43:33 Gun control... extended background checks.... extended waiting period... mandatory mental health education... ban bump stocks... ban assault weapons....in addition to 21 years of age. Study what they do in Israel with regards to guns... lastly give back $3.3mil to the NRA
701 2018-03-04 15:43:01 Well, yeah. Since Amazon buys up whole stocks of every book and drives titles into being out of print, their algorithm is weaponized by their business practice.
702 2018-03-04 15:42:27 Bump stocks are a gimmick. Also banning them wouldn’t stop bump firing as it can be accomplished with a belt loop, rubber band etc.
703 2018-03-04 15:41:56 Stocks been going up. And none of those tax for the regular people are permanent but those for him and his super rich friends. Black unemployment went up from 6.8 to about 7.2 under trump which is double that of white folk

708 2018-03-04 15:37:10 Austerity hurt the UK big time.  Is the pinch extra sharp because of the global elite and flooding the UK to access the EU and depleting housing stocks forcing average households to forego ownership? Will the global elite leave?
709 2018-03-04 15:37:07 You're not advocating for training, you're advocating to ban certain guns. You should start any conversation with the truth. By the way, the actual altering of a weapon to full auto is already a federal offense. Bump stocks don't do that, they just shoot faster.
710 2018-03-04 15:37:05 Write your local, state, and national representatives today and urge them to act to save our society (can we call it SOS?) by outlawing bump stocks, large capacity ammo magazines, and rapid-fire, semi-automatic, military-style guns known as assault rifles. It's time America! 
711 2018-03-04 15:37:04 I will differ strongly pull Noncomprehensive Play up Disagree with an emphasis on Physical Illness. Demote rejuvenate to 21 and beginning sale of Promote Stocks! Congress differ in a mood to finally unmake something on this recall - I despair!
712 2018-03-04 15:37:01 Oh, OF COURSE NOT. Waste less time on this STUPID, COMPLETELY DE-BUNKED IDEA. Fix NICS, get universal background checks in, restrict by age & bump stocks & semi-assault rifles to gun ranges at most. Get every horny nazi laid.
713 2018-03-04 15:36:55 So do you think the stocks are too “high”?
714 2018-03-04 15:36:19 False. Bump stocks do not make semi autos fire like a fully automatic rifle. Stop this garbage.
715 2018-03-04 15:36:14 A company with, what, 2 employees, much less the equipment, rebuild the power lines? Really?
I work for a power company. I go from service center to service center daily, see dozens of trucks, stocks of material ready to go as needed.
716 2018-03-04 15:35:59 Put Grieve and Starmer in the stocks more like
717 2018-03-04 15:33:58 A truck killed 80+ in Paris & we do have to take driving tests. We don't need bump stocks, that much is true but we don't need crazies either. In Boston & other countries they are using home made bombs. Should we take safety classes on that also?
718 2018-03-04 15:33:06 A ban on bumb stocks and high capacity magazines to slow down the potential for harm.
719 2018-03-04 15:32:39 So have we been monitoring Ross's stocks! He's a total crook money launderer for Russian money.
720 2018-03-04 15:32:25 This is why the proposals put forth by representative right now are bull shit-they aren’t doing enough. “We raise the age to buy them? Ban bump stocks?” ITS NOT ENOUGH
721 2018-03-04 15:32:13 It’s a tricky time to be an investor in stocks and bonds. 

In my opinion, to justify current equity valuations and experience further gains, stock investors need perpetually low interest rates and a stable bond market.
722 2018-03-04 15:32:10 #askBuddy What about banning bump stocks, AR-15's and high capacity magazines as a beginning?
723 2018-03-04 15:31:59 Have you ever heard of liquidating assets? Why couldn't he have simply said, "I need a couple million in spending money. What can I sale that I don't really need? These stocks will do."...???
724 2018-03-04 15:31:51 They're too clueless to not sleep."ignorance is bliss"The subject is to layered to say, Just Ban um! When law makers are clueless about what a gun is,They make lists of banned attributes, Makers Modify N comply. We still have Assault rifles. But with wood stocks,no carry handles
725 2018-03-04 15:31:49 Oui il y a souvent un monde entre le site, l'app et les stocks sur place
726 2018-03-04 15:31:20 Yes sure he was joking . It's the sort off thing he would do and wouldn't put it past him to do it. Plus did he help a friend make millions by selling steel stocks before off his tarrif announcement. You got to wonder.
727 2018-03-04 15:31:20 ITS FUN TO SEE investment professionals on financial TV explain why inflation was good for stocks. 
Their equity ownership justifications of TINA (there is no alternative to stocks) 
& FOMO (fear of missing out) were creative! 

What is next, trade wars are good for stocks too?

737 2018-03-04 15:27:36 It's semantics...but no device ("bump stocks" in particular) can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic.  Bump stocks increase the rate of trigger pulls.  Automatic weapons are military-grade (M-16, etc.).  Legislators should know that.  Disappointing that they don't.
738 2018-03-04 15:27:23 That’s rubbish :( shud see stocks again tomorrow I reckon. Or hunt out a bakery :) x
739 2018-03-04 15:27:16 I wonder why @ChuckTodd didn't ask Wilbur Ross about Trump's buddy Carl Icahn dumping his steel stocks ahead of Trump's tariff announcement. Obviously this needs an SEC investigation.

Just kidding. I know why Chuck let Ross ramble. Chuck doesn't like asking hard questions.

740 2018-03-04 15:27:15 Unfortunately yes because if whole bill fails you get nothing. But what about adding smaller things like raise age to 21, ban bump stocks, let CDC study gun violence, domestic violence provision etc.
741 2018-03-04 15:27:02 “Price of a stock reflects both fundamentals as well as the perception of market participants. Stocks ought to be bought when they are going up on improving fundamentals rather than when they are coming down on a deteriorating perception.”

748 2018-03-04 15:22:41 Why aren't the members of the media questioning the SEC about Icahn's sale of the stocks?  Obviously, he was given some hint in his telephone chats with Trump.
749 2018-03-04 15:21:22 From my understanding a lot of what BF were doing was taking postions in worthless companies and ramping them up all the while selling? 80% of BF stocks losing massive %. ? N4P a con or manipulated??

772 2018-03-04 15:10:37 @RepFrenchHill Ban assault weapons except for those needed by the military and police; ban bump stocks; allow The N F Act to register firearms, firearms owners or firearms transactions; stop NRA promotion of guns; stop taking NRA contributions as you have been doing.

My brother just went to a major bank and they did the same thing sadly. No one wants to work hard and pick real stocks.

You need to return NRA donations and stand up for school children!
778 2018-03-04 15:07:26 It depends a lot on Carl Icahn and Trump's other cronies, 
if they made enough profit selling their steel and auto stocks high and then buying back when they dropped.
779 2018-03-04 15:07:13 So I've just spent an hour retrieving my donor account and when I went to look for an appointment there's hardly any left for a month. Are you putting extra sessions on since stocks are so low?

782 2018-03-04 15:04:11 2/2 A better way to approach gun control would be to stop selling high capacity clips, banning bump stocks, better background checks, and increasing the age limit to 21. That way the real hunting enthusiast is not affected and the snot nosed teen with poor judgement is kepts away

787 2018-03-04 15:00:06 My understanding is bump stocks just use the recoil to initiate the next trigger pull. I’ve also heard it’s only a couple rounds per second difference and extremely inconsistent.

I won the Luigicord tornament going Gunner and Swordfighter only. I also took 3 stocks in a crew battle with Gunner.

808 2018-03-04 14:48:54 I'm not opposed to tightening some of our current gun laws as well as removing loopholes & getting rid of bump stocks. However I don't believe in taking away our gun rights bc law enforcement failed to do their job. It only reinforces why we need #2A rights

819 2018-03-04 14:38:52 Uh. Steel stocks went up after the announcement. So selling resulted in missed profit opportunity. Seems like few of the tweeters understand that selling stock before it goes up is stupid if you had insiders knowledge about the new tariffs

853 2018-03-04 14:16:19 Ya ha ha ha I like you. I trade stocks looking out my window at the Gulf of Mexico so I must know a little more than you bud :) lots of bag holders on many stocks right now  sounds like you could be one.
854 2018-03-04 14:15:41 so you sure have sold your millions of steel stocks, haven't you?
855 2018-03-04 14:15:04 You need to pick your stocks carefully rather than chase rainbows. At least one of those stocks is a bargepole for me.
856 2018-03-04 14:15:03 Speculation: If BF is naked short on GWMO, then the receivers will need to unwind that position reasonably quickly to de-risk before other players get wind that there is a forced buyer.  Could see a short squeeze on this and other stocks?
857 2018-03-04 14:14:51 @ChuckTodd Really? Wilbur Ross.  This fool is so freaking rich and out of touch with the mainstream it is unbelievable. Why are you not reporting on Carl Icahn selling off 31M of his steel stocks? #MTP #MeetThePress #SundayMorning Please tell Trump #GetOutOfOurHouse
858 2018-03-04 14:14:29 Our accord should work for everyone, not just for stocks.
859 2018-03-04 14:14:24 Obama approved bump stocks #TriggerALiberalIn4Words
860 2018-03-04 14:14:16 Agree only good stocks moving from here..only scrap stock HAMMERD
861 2018-03-04 14:13:29 Yes, and Republican legislators rushed to write Bills to change LAW that prevented the banning of bump stocks.
862 2018-03-04 14:12:28 They get rich short-selling the stocks they are going to tank.  Meanwhile, Americans lose their homes and retirement savings.
863 2018-03-04 14:11:59 Just checking and what have I missed

Well well well the *laughing stocks* that is Arsenal & Wenger continues as 2-0 down away to Brighton
864 2018-03-04 14:11:55 Clearly if thoughts & prayers are our protection, we can ban/limit/suppress all of those pesky unnecessary high capacity magazines, bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles. Hell, give Americans the pen, no matter their beliefs I don't question the majority will approve this.
865 2018-03-04 14:11:45 Bump stocks approved for sale by ATF under Obama administration because per the LAW (apparent now Republicans don't give a shit about the LAW) it would have been illegal to ban them. Republicans then rushed to write Bills to change law so they could be banned...oh, wait..FRliar
866 2018-03-04 14:10:34 @KHolland2014 it's YOUR tweet that sounds "bullying" This young man is speaking up against his fellow classmates while YOU r attacking him, a student! Now see how that works he hasn't been talking about stocks, banning businesses or being an "attention Hogg" as some are:)
867 2018-03-04 14:07:10 I never said anything about repealing the 2nd amendment. We’re talking about common sense gun laws; banning bump stocks, banning high capacity/rapid-fire guns and unifying background check systems with more stringent regulations. Good guys still get their guns... 
868 2018-03-04 14:07:08 Owning stocks is like having children -don't get involved with more than you can handle.The part-time stock picker probably has time to follow 8-12 companies,and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant.There don't have to be more than 5 co’s in the portfolio at anytime
869 2018-03-04 14:06:03 My guess: Trump will renege on the tariffs. Meanwhile, bc steel stocks are lower, Icahn will rebuy more shares at lower price.
870 2018-03-04 14:05:35 Oh most definitely the tech bubble.  Many corporates levered up and reduce equity capital. M&A at ridiculous valuations were significantly based on debt but stocks was rising and everyone thought it will never drop, until it did.

874 2018-03-04 14:01:40 Small account tweet a bombshell, no one notices. “Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks”This man hasn’t traded/touched his steel stock since 2015, 1 wk before Trump announced steel tariffs, he sells all.
875 2018-03-04 14:01:25 Then somehow, Carl Icahn found out Trump was going to announce the trade war involving steel and aluminum, so he traded all his steel stocks the day before Trump made his off the cuff, trade war, and made millions on that!!
876 2018-03-04 13:57:57 Let us not forget the Prescient gift Carl Icahn employed to sell Millions of $ of Stock that would be adversely affected by Tariffs. Stocks he had not traded since 2015.

891 2018-03-04 13:45:19 No scandal. The catalyst for steel stocks was the 232 report and recommendations from the commerce department on steel and aluminum which they recommended tariffs. This was before @realDonaldTrump comments. #FakeNews #MaterialsSpikedAfterComments

922 2018-03-04 13:21:11 While we are all disappointed when the stock markets decline, remember this is normal, just volatility, and without volatility stocks would return similar long term returns as cash - its all part of the investment experience - so thank goodness for volatility #portfoliosense

983 2018-03-04 12:15:45 Lots of times stocks/sector bottom out when it's extremely dark. People get consumed by pessimistic newsflow but Price watchers find great opportunities just at that time. Reading Price Action helps
984 2018-03-04 12:15:03 Finde immernoch das Tischtennis Teams Format am sinnvollsten. Kombiniert die Strategie und den Teamgeist von Crews aber verhindert dabei, dass dumme Scheisse passiert weil man nur 4 stocks hat
985 2018-03-04 12:15:01 please fist fuck another header with stocks to make up for the fact you can't blend
986 2018-03-04 12:12:57 Ummmmm ......you really think stocks are cheap?
987 2018-03-04 12:12:50 Swap bump stocks, AR-15's for muskets... conflict with the 2nd solved.

Boring, ain't it?

But :
What if: They did and decided that the Risk Reward you offer is no longer favourable so they close out position saying:  "NO THANK YOU"! 
#Stocks #Markets
990 2018-03-04 12:11:18 @tesco Pontypridd is like Armageddon. Car park almost full, massive queues at all checkouts and low stocks even of essentials items. Lots of people just buying #EasterEggs 
991 2018-03-04 12:11:15 Ouais beaucoup de stocks alors
992 2018-03-04 12:11:11 I doubt he understands that a trade war would hurt the stock market. He probably thinks it means more business for American companies, therefore positive for stocks
993 2018-03-04 12:10:56 'Most drs are nra' , and this information is factual, how? This is not a black/white thing. It **may** be an urban-rural thing. Maybe not. Right now from Maine, this looks like a national lynch mob. NRA had no position on bump stocks yet no ban occurred. WHY?
994 2018-03-04 12:10:55 Also, most of that wealth is in assets (stocks, real estate). Sudden liquidation of all of them would cause prices to plummet to nearly nothing. Much better to just expropriate and nationalize the assets.

1004 2018-03-04 12:04:27 Make your accusation.  No need to flirt with the words.  The stocks were dropping based on public comments but you are tying it to a specific announcement to make it sound like insider trading.  Just say that...

1016 2018-03-04 11:56:34 These are the "unrealized losses". Basically the stocks that the SS holds have appreciated in value, but are still less than their purchase price by some JD 25 million (compared with JD 121 million a year earlier).

1033 2018-03-04 11:25:35 No they did a study & the Huffington post reported on it. The ban did make a difference. Also it is just common sense that if Bump stocks & semi automatic weapons are not avalible they won't be used. Australia did it & they don't have these massacres. We are not dumber than them.

1046 2018-03-04 11:09:32 Are you serious? Do fish have passports? Outside the CFP how are we going to stop rogue boats poaching fish from British coastal waters? The whole point of quotas and rules is to stop overfishing, conserve fish stocks and stop 'Cod Wars.'

1052 2018-03-04 11:01:53 There's a housing problem, because governments have completely failed to build more social housing. Immigration is NOT the problem. Right to buy has also meant that stocks of council housing has fallen without being replaced.
1053 2018-03-04 11:01:40 Yes I support him all he said was no bump stocks, and more background checks. Law abiding people don't have to worry about more stringent background checks
1054 2018-03-04 10:56:51 In the field of common stocks, a little bit of a great many can never be more than a poor substitute for a few of the outstanding.

1065 2018-03-04 10:47:13 If economists and the politicians they advise don’t see this distinction, they enact policies that deliberately starve the economy of much needed money that the public uses to spend and save. It should be no surprise, given austerity, that stocks of savings are very low.
1066 2018-03-04 10:47:09 You share so many stocks and when one one of them goes up you retweet it like you are India’s only value investor. Dont confuse. Or paste the list of all stocks on exchange, so that which ever goes up, retweet that one.

1069 2018-03-04 10:41:46 I have no sympathy for those who invest their money in reserved list cards ; they should buy stocks or bonds instead. These are not based on a two decades old "promise" and don't alienate any player.
Repeal the RL, notice it 3 years in advance, and let the market adjust smoothly.

1077 2018-03-04 10:28:21 granted, i ain't followed it religiously but mainstream news is now repeating the claim that the recent Vegas shooter not only had multiple bump-stocks in his possession, but actively used them in the massacre
1078 2018-03-04 10:28:11 All very well but he’s ‘, inexperienced, unethical, inept and in a corner. He also has the nuclear codes and possibly Mathis and Kelly to handle him. He makes remarks like tariffs on steel and alum. And stocks crash.  Then there’s the tax scam. He can’t pay us back.

1096 2018-03-04 10:04:17 The musket was the AR-15 of that time. 
Today we have a semi- automatic. That means you must pull the trigger for every round (bump stocks excluded). The military has machine guns and Gatling guns plus others.
"Well Regulated" keeps automatics out of civilian hands. @POTUS @VP
1097 2018-03-04 10:01:43 Fish don't stay within EEZs. Back before the CFP Britain, Netherlands and Denmark couldn't agree on quotas on many occasions. This inevitably led to fish wars where one of the nations overfished unilaterally. This led to a reduction of stocks for all countries.
1098 2018-03-04 10:01:31 No school shooter has ever had a bump stock. Where do you get your rhetoric from? BTW, Obama signed the law permitting bump stocks, and when Congress tried to ban them later in his administration he vetoed it. The More You Know!
1099 2018-03-04 10:00:07 How does improving background checks and banning bump stocks overturn the 2A?
1100 2018-03-04 09:57:24 I enjoy the low transaction cost you have now. It so easy to build a de-risked portfolio with many stocks. It was not the case 10 years ago when you was a small active trader.

1107 2018-03-04 09:55:19 I was a fan of Obama and still am, but he did nothing on gun control. Trump has already banned bump stocks and told Congress and Senators they are scared of NRA. Things finally getting done.

1115 2018-03-04 09:44:34 It was public knowledge, that's what I said. Everybody dealing w/ stocks knew this was coming, Trump has been talking about those tariffs even before he was candidate. And if you look this particular stock's movement in recent months, there might be other 'plays; around it.

CFP is about managing fish stocks. Fishing territory is UNCOS - nothing to do with EU. 
Nothing on what replaces CFP. How will the UK manage fisheries post-Brexit is the Q?

1147 2018-03-04 09:12:05 Staying away from auto industry stocks.  If Fiat truly gave bonuses and hired 2500 workers, then steel tariffs and higher wages will push auto prices up.  Less cars sold will cut the jobs and profit.  Not good investment.

1152 2018-03-04 09:09:37 I don’t know if “easily protect kids” is part of everyone’s agenda. If everyone voluntarily stopped making, selling, and buying assault rifles, bump stocks, extra large ammo magazines that would make it incredibly easy. But...
1153 2018-03-04 09:08:30 But what about the countries with very little, if any, guns with virtually ZERO gun violence (Japan, Australia, etc.)? Also, nobody in power of any kind wants to take ALL GUNS AWAY, just bump stocks and high powered rifles used in massacres.

1180 2018-03-04 08:30:07 Maybe it's just because at close on 19x tax benefited CY18 earnings S&P500 stocks were just too expensive! Especially with central banks holding the equivalent of 37% of GDP in assets across US ECB BOJ &BOE which means rates go up - over time even without much inflation.
1181 2018-03-04 08:27:26 I've typed this slowly so you can keep up. If SA funded terrorism why didn't Trump but a ban in place the same way he did with other nations? Did the Russians tell him not to? Why did his friends dump stocks in steel and aluminum before the tarrif was announced? Go banjo time

1193 2018-03-04 08:11:27 Looks like they're supplied from UK & have stocks more suited to UK palates. I avoid the place in general as they were fleecing the Irish during the boom. Sums up our own way relationship with UK. German stores, conversely, a great addition...
1194 2018-03-04 08:07:30 Just In Time isn't good enough when you've Red warnings. Supermarkets don't have to be getting extra stocks of Kale but extra frozen & canned goods, more water is vital. Any excess left over could be given to poor. Govt can partially subsidise it as well.
1195 2018-03-04 08:07:28 The2nd amendment was written back in 1700’s. It is out of date and needs to be amended to consider the devastation of assualt guns  & bump stocks. Thorough background checks are needed.

1231 2018-03-04 07:23:19 LOL.....You ignore the national retail chains which are dropping sales of AR-15s, or raising the age limit, you ignore the companies that have cut ties with the NRA, you even ignore the gun shows which are now NOT selling bump stocks and AR-15's...Because of the young generation
1232 2018-03-04 07:22:51 We may run out of stocks with certain products due to high demand and other unavoidable circumstances. Pls talk to your local store mgt to inquire when they will have the product available. -Rad
1233 2018-03-04 07:21:16 But, it is time to regulate assault weapons, bump stocks, & any other product designed for the 1 purpose of killing humans to be prohibited from access 2 average citizens, especially children! I know my kids, and I’m not worried, but god forbid, they lose it. Just NO! NO ACCESS!
1234 2018-03-04 07:21:05 I have Shs as hedge so I'd be cool w/that & prob load up long -opp- from there.. 1 thing for sure djt & the world is nuts.

1263 2018-03-04 06:49:21 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1264 2018-03-04 06:48:53 If one trades AND invests it's very helpful. At these random times one can get some stocks REALLY cheap for no apparent reason. Trading these though maybe tough because of the time required to hold on.

1323 2018-03-04 05:19:56 Regardless Bump stocks make guns you can get legally a fully automatic weapon. Also semi autos you can shoot as fast as your finger can go. Clip sizes don't need to be 20 rounds or more either and shouldn't be allowed.
1324 2018-03-04 05:19:38 If Trump had put his daddy's $$ in stocks and smoked dope for 40 years, he would have more $$ than he has now. And your math needs a link to back it up--you won't find one in the fact-free zone.
1325 2018-03-04 05:16:55 Very true. I don't want any crazy strict gun control, but definitely several sensible measures that I feel we'd have been more successful in passing if we didn't have so much NRA influence: more thorough background checks, bump stocks, closing loopholes, assault weapon ban.
1326 2018-03-04 05:14:16 I'm just wondering @NRA @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @CNN @Emma4Change volunteer to give up semi-autos, bump stocks and other multiple use weapons, without any laws change, implemented everyone wins, right? #nobanrequired #keep2ndA #keepkidssafer

1341 2018-03-04 04:55:29 Your gun accessories are not covered under the constitution.  Make the argument for the weapon.  Founding fathers didn't have suppressors, ACOG scopes, bump stocks, extended mags, R. I. P. ammo, etc.  These things are not arms, and are beyond the scope of any 2A argument.

1346 2018-03-04 04:53:44 Second! Automatic weapons are regulated, and semi-automatic are less so. Bump stocks allow that gap to be bridged. What do I recommend? Regulating after market additions seems a start.

Read in past that margin facility for delivery stocks will be introduced in zerodha platform. Want to move to zerodha but waiting for this facility. Is is available now.

1355 2018-03-04 04:46:13 Darn it Siri I meant what I typed.  Bump Stocks.
1356 2018-03-04 04:45:10 Yes sir, numb stocks  should’ve never made it out of development
1357 2018-03-04 04:43:56 Both asset classes have been moving in tandem together these days, especially during times of market stress. This leaves very few save havens for investors to take shelter. @EconGlobal #markets #stocks #bonds #equity #Rates #Investing #Traders #DollarIndex #economy #portfolio
1358 2018-03-04 04:42:55 Everybody makes billions. Bin Laden's, Bush's, Ensor's.  Cheney, Gore, Mueller and many more loaded on defense stocks all get rich from war.  Unbelievable how easy it was. They tear up the 4th amendment getting spying ability from 911 as well. Another globalist check mark.

1361 2018-03-04 04:38:51 There have been bank scams of great magnitude and bank stocks have taken a beating on the bourses; my point is that further scams not likely to happen in coming few years because of greater vigil and Modi at helm then why not buy PSB stocks!
1362 2018-03-04 04:37:06 After reviewing every trade I made in 2017 I found out that in almost every situation I sold way to early. I always have the right idea but I get worried or I impatient and sell before the move happens. in stocks and coins I was a month or less from a respectable account

1365 2018-03-04 04:34:26 Why did Zucker & Gates drop facebook stocks.
1366 2018-03-04 04:32:26 You: Mark Zoidberg has announced he is giving away 50 million in stocks but what you haven’t heard is that 10% is going to people like you and ME. All you have to do is copy and paste this and tag 10 of your friends. Facebook will go through the posts and give out $5,000 to diffe

1370 2018-03-04 04:29:45 Such big lot size stocks I don't track sir as option chain changes are too fast.
1371 2018-03-04 04:27:20 It will just trade. Don’t worry about it and just buy some deals. I am! I’ll be buying stocks Monday morning at work.
1372 2018-03-04 04:27:10 If stock market experts were so experts than they would have been buying stocks instead of selling advice !!
1373 2018-03-04 04:23:50 Can’t wait to see what the market does on Monday! Anyone checking if he is shorting any stocks?
1374 2018-03-04 04:22:30 In ten minutes, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds murdering 58 and injuring 851. He accomplished this carnage because he was armed with 24 firearms. Many were AR-15 type rifles fitted with bump stocks and 100-round magazines, all LEGALLY purchased.
1375 2018-03-04 04:20:57 Will the bear market strike in full? Finally reasonably priced housing and stocks!
1376 2018-03-04 04:16:22 All the recent mass shootings have been done with semi-automatic rifles--LV did employ the Bump stocks. Do you know the difference between semi-auto and full auto? All the shooters bought the guns legally. Most of the shooters were nuts--literally. Seeing the problem?
1377 2018-03-04 04:15:43 So true. My ex lives in England & travels Europe often   He/we are laughing stocks
1378 2018-03-04 04:15:18 if you base it on dumb stocks then sure they are , in terms of income and profit they are still ahead but nice try.
1379 2018-03-04 04:15:02 Listening to all this gun banning BS . Simple answers . Ban all clips on guns that have capacity to hold more than 5 rounds, ban bump stocks, ban all video games with violent killing scenes , ban CPS from stopping parents from spanking their kids , prayers in school .
1380 2018-03-04 04:11:59 The stocks will come back. The country needs this.

1384 2018-03-04 04:09:15 That’s why you continue to outperform all of my stocks. These incredible days do wonders for my portfolio. 
1385 2018-03-04 04:09:06 AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT -definitely 3 out of 4 stocks will reach 1 trillion dollar each in 2018.
1386 2018-03-04 04:08:10 I don’t believe Trump just suddenly created a tariff war on a whim, because he was angry.  If that’s true, how did his friend, Carl Icahn know to sell his stocks in steel well before Trump’s “impulsive” tariff?
1387 2018-03-04 04:07:42 So when will ATF decide bump stocks are machine guns in ATF-2018-001-001 per Vivian Chu #BanAssaultRifles #ParklandStudentsSpeak @votevets

1389 2018-03-04 04:05:00 Getting Rid of the Sales of Bump Stocks, Assault Weapons, and Extended Magazine Clips to Civilians IS NOT Getting Rid of Guns.
Demanding Mental Health Screening, No Sales To Domestic Abusers & Felons IS SMART.
Its Getting Rid of the EXCUSE, Oh Well, There Was Nothing We Could Do.

1391 2018-03-04 04:02:42 Really, that’s what made bump stocks so popular to save you from flipping a switch 
1392 2018-03-04 04:00:03 Can you give an example of how you manage your stop losses? Do you just exit all option positions when stocks breaks a certain predetermined level?
1393 2018-03-04 03:59:24 yes i change that list regularly (typically monthly). most time i have about 8-10 stocks in that list.

1395 2018-03-04 03:57:06 Dude, just stop it. What is a guy with an assault rifle going to do to a government with drones, nuclear weapons, fighter jets, stealth bombers, cruse missiles, tomahawk missiles, and on and on. This is just some stupid BS the NRA feeds people to make sure gun stocks stay high.
1396 2018-03-04 03:56:57 Can I invest in BATMAN stocks as part of long term strategy?
1397 2018-03-04 03:56:32 I had 3 of the best guards in the state on one AAU team: Chris Stocks, Del Bogan, Willie Jimerson... they were slept on too. Recently I had Levi Woods , DeMarcus Sharp, and Klay Barton.. nothing changed but the name they still on the Bootheel
1398 2018-03-04 03:56:30 24 guns in total, more than 1100 rounds fired. All purchased LEGALLY between 2 diff states. Bought from big chains to mom and pops! Magazines holding 100 rounds. If he bought any from a flea market it can't be traced. Bump stocks can't b traced.
1399 2018-03-04 03:56:21 Florida has received the last dollar it will ever get from me until it passes gun reform. No one needs an automatic rifle, bump stocks or people who have mental problems to have access to guns.
1400 2018-03-04 03:56:08 so out of the stocks you play, what would you go long in on this dip? or add to a long position?
1401 2018-03-04 03:56:00 Except for Carl Icahn who sold $31 million of steel stocks shortly before the announcement.

1404 2018-03-04 03:54:20 I've looked at bump stocks since Vegas. Never heard of them before. They are ridiculous and have no business being in civilian hands. Military doesn't need them because we have full auto anyway. (M249)

1415 2018-03-04 03:45:29 Well, we know that the large businesses (the ones that own everything) are using their #TaxReform to buy back their stocks.

1417 2018-03-04 03:42:43 Criminals love bump stocks. It will certainly give them an advatage knowing the good guy doesn't have the same capability.
  Any gun control or regulation to strangle ones ability to protect themselves is infringement and counter to the fundementals of our Constitution!
1418 2018-03-04 03:42:35 I support you, I believe you are doing a great job. Please stand for us, keep our constitutional rights in our hands. The banning of bump stocks and large capacity clips will not stop a criminal. If they want a gun they will simply go black market. Keep us on top,not the criminal
1419 2018-03-04 03:41:53 Also, please do inform me on the velocity / impact of their bullet delivery...? How about bump stocks and high capacity magazines? Clearly what the authors of the Bill of Rights had in mind right?

1425 2018-03-04 03:37:23 What a load of crap. 

30% of Americans own firearms and they want to hold the rest of us hostage. 

End gun shows, prohibit sale of assault rifles, ban large capacity magazines and bump stocks and increase the firearm eligible age limit to 21. 

U can keep a registered armory.
1426 2018-03-04 03:36:50 We should have 4 - 6 years to regression in the USA, crises in 2019 may still happen, Sunspot cycle is ending.

Crises may occur mostly in Europe, Middle East, Russia South America rather than in the USA.

1427 2018-03-04 03:35:31 Listen to us! It isn't going to be YOUR way this time
1. Ban automatic rifles
2. Ban bump stocks etc
3. Universal background CKs
4. Min Age restriction 21 
5. Gun license every gun 
6. 30 day wait
7. No sales at gun shows

1431 2018-03-04 03:33:24 for all the names i've been tracking, my PT remains the same. only one thing can significantly chance my PT on baba or other china stocks - how this tariff war goes.
1432 2018-03-04 03:32:40 Trumps finances are a public interest issue. If he is up to his neck in debt with those who would influence him then it is a public interest issue. His buddy sold all his steel related stocks ‘guessing’ that Trump would launch a trade war. Did Icahn have insider knowledge?
1433 2018-03-04 03:32:38 As a financial planner I am surprised that you are opposed to willing sales of stocks to willing buyers.  Do you suppose the sellers might have a use for the money?

1435 2018-03-04 03:31:45 So who sold millions in steel stocks last week right before the tariffs were announced? Hmm isn’t that insider trading ? Isn’t that ILLEGAL?

like banning green paint for nukes.

1443 2018-03-04 03:22:41 I'm pretty sure the @NRA was on board with regulating bump stocks and the 2A already has a good number limitations.

1446 2018-03-04 03:21:47 Actually, Trump has proposed banning bump stocks. Several retailers are raising their minimum ages to purchase rifles to 21.
Please keep in mind that gun control only affects LEGAL gun ownership. Criminals can still obtain (or manufacture) guns.

1455 2018-03-04 03:13:39 Wrong word NYT! Buffett knows the game. He does not “enjoy” the 29B dollar. He’s no big shot. Now let’s take a long look at Carl Icahn this week! Did he dump steel stocks? Why? Where did he get the info? Duh.
1456 2018-03-04 03:12:13 I see inverted cups everywhere!
If market weakens most stocks will follow to the downside
1457 2018-03-04 03:11:24 I can relate to the wondering about whether posts i make for example about private equity investing in gun stocks or US military spend being 12x that of the uk, while the uk has free healthcare but not 12 x less enemies, will lose me readers. But we must not censor ourselves.
1458 2018-03-04 03:09:55 Yes, revive assault weapons ban and add weapons readily susceptible of conversion (AR-15).  But also need:  universal background checks; bans on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks; and increased regulation of purchases by mentally ill and suspected terrorists.
1459 2018-03-04 03:07:38 How many selected stocks do you focus on and does your stock list change up regularly?
1460 2018-03-04 03:07:13 Did you give Icahn inside information on the steel and aluminum tariffs. How did he know to sell over 30 million in steel stocks just before you announced the tariffs. That’s against the law. Your the only way he could have known. Need to investigate this as another crime by you.

1465 2018-03-04 03:01:31 In the @TheDemocrats dream world of 2nd Amendment "Gun Control" I too believe in compromise. Since Dems want to ban *bump stocks* (which is fine for me) THEN they should compromise that NO DEMOCRAT should be allowed to own a rifle. Shootings always a DemocRAT or family member of!
1466 2018-03-04 03:00:25 Good! Dow may fall initially, because of the initial fear of trade war. However, us everyday Americans who invest in U.S stocks will soar! Billionaires will lose since all their stocks are kept overseas. They must bring money back to U.S and invest in America

1468 2018-03-04 02:56:52 the key is to use computer software that can identify the stocks that play true to form on RSI or other indicators. As investment bank algos pick up on this trend. Others may not. That is why having the right tools are so important.
1469 2018-03-04 02:56:45 Goes to show--anyone who buys stocks at high valuations gets crushed even long-term. There are 30-yr bear markets. Stocks for the long-term, indeed. Lol. We really haven't had a secular bear market yet. 2000-01 deflation of only bubble stocks. 2002 and 2008 brief panics.
1470 2018-03-04 02:56:09 And anyone who puts an asterisk after the H gets put in stocks in the town square so they can be mocked.
1471 2018-03-04 02:55:21 Where, pray tell are you getting your information? Are there automatic weapons, yes. Can they be acquired by general public easily, no. They fall under NFA rules and were made before 1986.  Bump stocks are a different story. The click of the thumb you speak of is BS.
1472 2018-03-04 02:54:18 That's interesting--I was aware of price controls during the war but wasn't aware the WWII/post-WWII price reset was that dramatic. Shows how hard it is to maintain/grow wealth long-term. Stocks did well because valuations got smashed in the 1930s.
1473 2018-03-04 02:53:33 And why do you think bump stocks need to be banned?
1474 2018-03-04 02:52:43 2,200! Stocks are running low so go get em. Enjoy your day!

1479 2018-03-04 02:48:52 So you are saying you like camel stocks? The only stocks i know with bumps.
1480 2018-03-04 02:48:03 All boys, and I am sure they are 99 percent white. Why are these boys so unable to process daily life? I want a ban on assault type rifles and bump stocks, but I also want to know why these boys and young men are all so broken, and how we fix it.
1481 2018-03-04 02:46:51 @PeterLe30125667 and the police in Vegas did everything wrong in the investigation and the pictures that they showed the public did not show bump stocks they showed a lot of guns sitting on tripods you don’t use a bump stock and the time of death was dated the day after
1482 2018-03-04 02:46:31 Wealthy donors got their tax cuts, got their gun stocks, got their tariffs, got money from the Saudis in their pockets. Jews got their Jersusalem. They love it. Hope they love it when Mar alago FLOODS!
1483 2018-03-04 02:45:25 @PeterLe30125667 I was just wondering if someone could explain what is so special about the AR 15 that people like it so much more than other guns so the only reason they’re attacking it is because of Florida and bump stocks were made for handicap people so they could shoot
1484 2018-03-04 02:45:02 Thank you for following! @Ameronis @Joe_Heap_ @Sowerbutt @FXS_Stocks_ES
1485 2018-03-04 02:44:46 If advisors claim MF can yield 15%  then stocks must give more...
1486 2018-03-04 02:42:07 "The formal declaration of tariffs and Trump’s robust embrace of trade wars spooked investors..."

It didn't spook Carl Icahn because he weirdly dumped $32 million in steel stocks days before Trump's tweet ranked their market value. Hmmm...
1487 2018-03-04 02:41:36 PUTANGINA PAANO KA NAKABILI NYAN DOOOOOON???? I'M ALWAYS ASKING FOR STOCKS OF THESE PERO AAAAAAAAA

1489 2018-03-04 02:40:23 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1490 2018-03-04 02:38:45 Selling? They sold it over 40 years ago. And the gov't has been taken to court over it, it goes against our Constitution.  News off this is curiously ignored, but not hard to find.
Both parties have failed us. 
I suggest you buy bank stocks, that's where our tax revenue is going.
1491 2018-03-04 02:36:36 Haters just keep hating. Why don't you spend your time pumping the stocks you like instead bashing others? Life is too short for all this hating. Maybe you could try and find something you do like and it might make you a better person. Just saying...
1492 2018-03-04 02:36:26 im callin it now being in shape or swole gona trend with rappers again like it did in early 2000s they gona start getting into shit like investments, cryptos, property and stocks too, as if they already didnt, but start flauntin about it like chains, watch

1494 2018-03-04 02:35:18 As you know ,stocks prices is reflected in a mirror .We are afraid that economic war will start.
1495 2018-03-04 02:33:17 We start by banning the sale of new ones at stores and gun shows. Then we ban high capacity clips and bump stocks. Ban as in they're illegal to own not just purchase. Any time they're found by police they're seized.
1496 2018-03-04 02:32:13 @SpeakerRyan Since Icahn dumped stocks just before Trump announced the tariffs and no one knew but Trump himself sin't it time to look into insider trading here since it is totally illegal.Martha Stewart went to jail for a lot less. How about trying to do your job and be a leader
1497 2018-03-04 02:32:07 Were any of those 15 years spent in Canadian schools, because limiting access the guns, high capacity magazines and parts like bump stocks and silencers works like a charm up here, pastor!
1498 2018-03-04 02:30:59 Rational is:
Banning assault weapons and bump stocks.
Background checks.
Age restrictions.
Waiting periods.
Closing gun shows.
Funding Mental health.
Irrational is:
Arming teachers.
Believing people are coming for your guns.
1499 2018-03-04 02:30:44 Looking forward to the inevitable evidence that Icahn spoke to someone in the administration just before he dumped the stocks.
1500 2018-03-04 02:29:55 cool, it’s obviously working well for u.  Do u trade multiple stocks at the same time or just concentrate on 1?
1501 2018-03-04 02:28:52 #TriggerALiberalIn4Words bought bump stocks today. 
1502 2018-03-04 02:27:00 Whatever was banned prior needs to be banned again.   And bump stocks.  Easy as that.

1505 2018-03-04 02:25:27 I don’t scan for stocks per say. I built a list of stocks in play based on news, offshore comps, ETF movements, commodities etc. and then I monitor them all day!
1506 2018-03-04 02:25:10 Bump stocks are cool. #TriggerALiberalIn4Words
1507 2018-03-04 02:25:03 I just said depends on ones trading/investment strategy because I won't pick one in the trips even if it "could" be a 10-bagger on hype. I feel $OWCP is legit enough to trade for frequent profits OR invest in.
1508 2018-03-04 02:24:18 Sometimes when I’m feeling lonely I buy some stocks

It’s nice to have a bit of company
1509 2018-03-04 02:24:07 some more trade war talk this time w/ europeans over cars lol agitator-in-chief at it.  now we got that risk to calculate *sigh  let’s if there is any spine to it if the US car stocks show some movement… thinking tsla gm f to watch
1510 2018-03-04 02:23:43 Perhaps you should learn something about business. I know many small business owners who have had to declare bankruptcy (it’s a business thing) and are sued for so many ridiculous things & not ridiculous things. Jay didn’t make his money in stocks. Smh. And he didn’t inherit.
1511 2018-03-04 02:22:53 Well, I certainly meant to imply I haven't done heavy DD on a lot of others, so honestly, $OWCP is still a favorite. I still own shares and am still excited for what I feel is coming - hopefully starting as soon as March but certainly more coming later.
1512 2018-03-04 02:22:19 Left-handed Kaorin, stocks += 100
1513 2018-03-04 02:19:48 By the time u eait for evidence, ur stocks will be of zero value...chk wat happened to all jewel stocks and winsome group comp stocks...niw its up to u
1514 2018-03-04 02:19:35 I’m putting away $200 into stocks - what should I put it in?
1515 2018-03-04 02:19:12 So the markets are finally set up for a large "correction" to the downside, which exposes greed in the form of leverage, which begets more uncertainty and all the sudden its 2K8 all over again. #trading #stocks #markets
1516 2018-03-04 02:18:07 Never said entirely stocks. But did you know that if you had bought 1000 shares of Microsoft in '86 and sold it in '99 you would have made around $1,379,000. from $21,000?
And Jay Inslee has never declared bankruptcy over and over like djt the con man grifter.
1517 2018-03-04 02:17:18 Just as you didn't qualify OWCP by saying it depends on one's trading/investment strategy, no need to do that for a 2018 pick. Criteria I would use fir success would be from the time u pick it to its highest peak during the year. So now what's your pick? I asked you first.

1520 2018-03-04 02:14:29 It was evading taxes on stocks. And out of the group with her, who took advantage of inside information. She was the only one who went to jail. She was also the only woman in the group. Not that I’m a big MS fan, but still.....
1521 2018-03-04 02:14:20 We make a LOT of money scanning for stocks that can GAP UP the next day. This video explains and shows our tactic. Need some extra $$$? This does it. It do this routine every afternoon for VIP's. #stocks
1522 2018-03-04 02:14:05 They did it on top of a few AR-15’s and bump stocks.
1523 2018-03-04 02:13:23 Don't ask foolish human questions. Just avoid Epizyme $EPZM #Stocks
1524 2018-03-04 02:11:54 Steel (and aluminum) stocks went UP so that would have been a very bad trade.
1525 2018-03-04 02:09:59 I don’t NEED anything.. #GOD has given me everything I already NEED.
 
1526 2018-03-04 02:09:54 You, your family, the GOP, and your admin are the laughing stocks.
1527 2018-03-04 02:08:41 PURE GENIUS!  President Trump considers taking guns before due process & outlawing bump stocks, effectively shutting down LEFTIES' interest in the matter.  They only real interest is the political expediency of campaigning on those issues!
1528 2018-03-04 02:08:26 But he sure promised & followed through on tipping off his pal #CarlIcahn to sell off his 13+ Million in steel stocks before announcing the tariff. Who by the way, hadn't traded any of his stocks since 2015. Coincidence? Just some more sleazy #insidertrading BS for his cronies
1529 2018-03-04 02:06:59 That happens in most stocks...
1530 2018-03-04 02:05:40 Foreigners turn net sellers of S. Korean stocks in Feb. //app.yonhapnews.co.kr/YNA/BASIC/SNS/r.aspx?c=AEN20180304000900320
1531 2018-03-04 02:04:54 Funny thing, Icahn didn't wait... He sold his steel stocks before Trump announced this new tariff.  Probably a coincidence.
1532 2018-03-04 02:04:32 In March 2009 I bought my first stock. $KMB, 23 shares. I’ve held them and reinvested the dividends every quarter. I now have 26 shares and the market value of my original investment has tripled. Not bragging, I could’ve done better w/other stocks, the point is- stay the course.
1533 2018-03-04 02:01:13 If you can prove he and inside info on the new laws being implemented it’d still be tough. Martha had inside tips to stocks. Far different than this.
1534 2018-03-04 02:00:35 $40 Mil in stocks? Giv me a break.
1535 2018-03-04 01:59:59 Bump stocks should not be banned. People need to learn just because you can doesn’t mean you should (as in own one to kill with) Just like taking a knee to our flag, again just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Common sense and good judgement and respect.
1536 2018-03-04 01:57:27 If you know anything about investing in stocks, help a girl out!!!
1537 2018-03-04 01:52:42 Has anyone checked if #TrumpCrimeFamily sold any Steel Stocks prior to #TrumpRussia announcing that they would place tariffs on #foreignsteel?
Why not piss off #Canada, eh?
1538 2018-03-04 01:51:52 Tariff's will not go through. Funny how Carl Ichan happened to dump steel-related stocks and made millions just before Trump's announcement.
1539 2018-03-04 01:51:20 Thanks coach for the chat in Indianapolis. I learned tons, Nurse and Williams at 3 and 4-athletic? Defenders that can shoot from a winning culture that play every possession like the last play of final four @Amber_Stocks
1540 2018-03-04 01:50:27 He does follow this - I'm waiting for more to come up about this Aluminum & Steel Tarriff & who connected to Trump profits from purchasing Stocks.
1541 2018-03-04 01:45:14 I dumped all my steel stocks last week too
1542 2018-03-04 01:45:04 Looking forward to the day we can trade stocks in BTC
1543 2018-03-04 01:43:51 makes no sense steel stocks were up huge after announcement
1544 2018-03-04 01:42:14 I have no sympathy for people who lose money in penny stocks that reverse split and perpetually go down. Like wtf did you think was going to happen lol.
1545 2018-03-04 01:40:47 Last night so I bought Bitcoin and vegan friendly stocks and then i can borrow?
1546 2018-03-04 01:40:32 So as a depression develops, stocks crash, allies won’t trade with us , this moron will spew “it’s all fake news people , fake news” !!!
1547 2018-03-04 01:38:24 Open an investigation on all who sold out on steel related stocks.
1548 2018-03-04 01:36:58 Last I check.. and I’m not a member... but I’m pretty sure NRA doesn’t promote gun violence and was the one who thought OBAMA allowing Bumber Stocks was a step to far.
Hmmm
1549 2018-03-04 01:36:08 Who selling vagina today...I made $1,000 in one day off the stock market on Friday and I’m trying to bless somebody daughter real quick  (kidding about the first part but yes I did make $1,000 off of stocks on Friday). I made an option with a trader & won 
1550 2018-03-04 01:36:00 And when you're done w/ that, how many of Trump's BFFs at Mar-a-Lago received a "heads up" from Trump about the plan for sanctions on steel & aluminum, so they could dump metals stocks before they tanked?
1551 2018-03-04 01:35:48 Sinadya ko talagang di bumalik sa stock room kahapon para si koyang stockman magdala ng stocks sa area. 
1552 2018-03-04 01:35:02 u want this public banter because u want followers ..
1553 2018-03-04 01:34:59 That said. You want something to reward you with your hard earned money,  I heard that stocks and bonds with dividends were a thing and that you don't get that by leaving cardboard in a closet and calling it a day.
1554 2018-03-04 01:34:52 Wonder how low those steel stocks have to fall before Icahn buys them back? A few weeks ago when market fell I’m sure corporations got to buy back stocks cheap. Are we starting to see the pattern?
1555 2018-03-04 01:33:29 "Congress needs to ban assault weapons and needs to ban bump stocks. It is insane for us to have to do this at the local level state-by-state."
- Gov. Kate Brown #orleg #orpol #GunViolence
1556 2018-03-04 01:31:36 Then what's the point of the whole "stocks on the blockchain" thingy?
I can already invest in companies right now, and without the blockchain, there is no innovation.
1557 2018-03-04 01:31:27 That's what I meant, bad wording on my part bro. I just saying I don't care about bump stocks but for those people wanting them banned have never heard of them before vegas. I was agreeing with you but just mis worded it.
1558 2018-03-04 01:31:16 Wouldn't surprise me if he buys the stocks back on Monday in lieu of another statement by the Orageutang that he has changed his mind on Tuesday
1559 2018-03-04 01:30:54 We never did investigate who bought and sold all those airline stocks right before 9/11 did we?
1560 2018-03-04 01:30:25 Trump had to tell Carl Icahn to sell off his stocks
1561 2018-03-04 01:30:23 Obama, who approved bump stocks?
1562 2018-03-04 01:30:11 Stocks & bonds.. what they know bout em
1563 2018-03-04 01:28:31 Owing some Canadian stocks at this moment is opportune $lulu #tradewars #trade becareful tho you may run out of the frying pan into the fire...
1564 2018-03-04 01:28:03 His father gave him $200m, if he’d put that into top 100 stocks or B grade real estate it would be worth somewhere between $8-12 billion in tangible assets. Trump is estimated to have only $1-3 billion in tangible assets (no one knows how much Russian debt is in the mix)
1565 2018-03-04 01:27:54 Tech don't give a shit about tariffs. Watch Dow stocks get hit and Tech Rip. If money managers are smart, they rotate hard. Let's see.
1566 2018-03-04 01:27:54 I find it amusing how all you hear in #LasVegas are full automatic rifles but mostly we see tripod rifles everywhere especially by the windows with short round clips & no bump-stocks attached to those, only a couple found in the room without tripods & 100 round clips attached.
1567 2018-03-04 01:26:58 Both parties have become laughing stocks.
1568 2018-03-04 01:26:21 Is anyone going to mention that Trump’s top aid dumped his steel stocks just before he made this announcement?
1569 2018-03-04 01:26:19 The wording in this petition is totally inaccurate. An assualt weapon wasn't used in the #FloridaShooting  A semi automatic is EVERY GUN. Automatics are already banned (since 1986)People using them or bump stocks are ALREADY breaking the law. Fix the wording or educate yourselves
1570 2018-03-04 01:25:24 I’ll buy stocks in a hot flash
1571 2018-03-04 01:25:13 If regulation on tokens is aligned with current Corporate Law, then I will need to be an accredited investor to invest in ICO.
What it is appeal of "stocks on the blockchain" then?
1572 2018-03-04 01:25:10 If they haven’t turned in their bump stocks, i doubt they want to bring attention to themselves. Are you planning to keep them anonymous?

1574 2018-03-04 01:23:51 Also, please note that that 8T number is very misleading. Eg, it includes foreign holdings of US stocks. So if the stock market does well relative to foreign stock markets, the net US position decreases.
1575 2018-03-04 01:23:49 Short some steel stocks the day before a trump speech....make millions
1576 2018-03-04 01:23:30 Biggest high school regret is not taking business math seriously when she was teaching us about stocks 
1577 2018-03-04 01:23:09 Has anyone checked to see if he, his family and or friends & associates have "shorted any Canadian listed stocks" in anticipation of the pathetic performance  (I mean the Budget )??
I'll bet there are 1 or 2, maybe even Muppetboy.?

1587 2018-03-04 01:16:19 You’re joking right? Do you or anyone own stocks lately? Trump is starting to ruin the economy.

1590 2018-03-04 01:13:16 The number of people who have gotten rich buying stocks is very very small.  The pros who have gotten rich did so by building businesses around stock buying (advisory, funds, etc).   Building a sustainable business is the key to building wealth.  The rest is a wage.

1594 2018-03-04 01:06:07 Respectfully, Robert, there are many completely legal hunting rifles in Canada that have pistol grips, black plastic stocks & other cosmetic characteristics which differ from your example. Using them does not make one a "criminal". Please cite legislation supporting your claim.

1600 2018-03-04 01:02:00 Just hamfist a political message into it, that's what all the cool kids are doing to stay relevant. I mean have you heard about Trumps recent proposal to ban bump stocks, absolutely laughable.
1601 2018-03-04 01:01:44 Counting all the $$$$ I made off my steel stocks! Boom Trump! Hahahah
1602 2018-03-04 01:00:53 Get rid of the bump stocks and enforce universal background checks. When you came out and said you weren't scared of the NRA, I thought to myself that is why I voted for him. He owes nothing to anybody. Please be that man.
1603 2018-03-04 00:58:45 Ok I’ve stayed off twitter for a minute but had to come back to call out dick-tator trump. The Hudson River tunnel opposition, the trade war on steel which came from a temper tantrum, the fact a former adviser dumped stocks before the tariffs, the utah monuments being exploited
1604 2018-03-04 00:58:30 @realDonaldTrump Get rid of the bump stocks and enforce universal background checks. When you came out and said you weren't scared of the NRA, I thought to myself that is why I voted for him. He owes nothing to anybody. Please be that man.

1607 2018-03-04 00:55:23 @TDAmeritrade On your scan tool in TOS,,,,,can I do a search for stocks which show "% off 52 week highs" and "% off 52 week lows"  ???
1608 2018-03-04 00:54:57 I am very disappointed that @SenatorTester is pro-gun to the point of refusing to budge on the AR-15 and age restrictions for purchasing weapons. Who the hell can't get behind banning bump-stocks?! I don't want to say I won't vote for you, but this might be a dealbreaker. #mtpol
1609 2018-03-04 00:54:09 Bump-stocks seem like an accident waiting to happen/uncontrolled firing.
1610 2018-03-04 00:53:58 Trump can't change his mind after his crony already insider traded his stocks.
1611 2018-03-04 00:51:25 Youtube firing AR-15s w and without bump stocks.  Some guys can fire just as fast.  They can be made as well.  So would banning them prevent a Las Vegas shooting? Idk.  When theres a school shooting people become reactionary and dont think.
1612 2018-03-04 00:51:21 While stocks last: Rustic Toasties!
Kids love 'em!
1613 2018-03-04 00:51:18 And missed that sweet rally on steel stocks?
1614 2018-03-04 00:51:15 Not steel stocks. Stocks in companies that manufacture with steel. Steel commodity price in the US will likely increase.
1615 2018-03-04 00:51:15 Glad we agree on bump stocks. But I think that no rifles with high muzzle velocity AND large magazines are good self-defense weapons, outside of a battlefield. Self-defenders are (or should be) wary of where the majority of their shots end up.

1617 2018-03-04 00:50:20 Why did some of his friends sell off all their oil/gas company stocks?
1618 2018-03-04 00:50:12 Secrets? Like Ichan selling his steel stocks. Those kinds of secrets. And favors. And future considerations.

1620 2018-03-04 00:49:21 P. Jurak, angličtinou vládnu slušně, ale i tak děkuji za Vaši starost o znalost cizích slov. Takže chcete říci, že vše ok zapomeňte na tunely OKD,IPB, IT zakázky, Mostecká uhelná, solární zlodějny za 100mil. a volte srdcem ODS,TOP09,KDU-ČSL,ČSSD díky už fakt ne!!!
1621 2018-03-04 00:48:34 What do you think of bump stocks. Should they be banned?
1622 2018-03-04 00:48:20 Oh, Trumps buddy Carl Icahn knows all about economics. He dumped millions in steel stocks a couple days before Trump made up the steel tariff. Martha Stewart went to jail for helping her friends with insider trading. How many high crimes & misdemeanors does Donnie get to commit ?
1623 2018-03-04 00:47:35 that time when all conclusions depend on the blanket assumption that returns on a pair of stocks follow a bivariate Vector Moving Average
1624 2018-03-04 00:47:32 Monk potentially on his way into Birmingham city is up there with Coleman joining Sunderland - bizzare. Both managers are highly thought of and stocks are high after recent success. Just goes to show jobs in the championship are now seen as premium roles. #AVFC
1625 2018-03-04 00:47:15 And I suppose the sell-off of stocks was just a coincidence. Sure!
1626 2018-03-04 00:47:08 not about % of #cash, or #stocks. People need to come to grips with finding the right #assetallocation for them (static portfolio). Ok to make tactical shifts but the #endowment model (#equities, #fixedincome, #alternatives) I think will outperform a 100% Domestic stock portfolio
1627 2018-03-04 00:46:31 Are bump stocks banned? No. Were they used in a massacre yes. Why shouldn't I bring up Bump stocks and yes other weapons?  As I told you, you only need a riffle and maybe a hand gun. You don't need weapons of mass distruction.
1628 2018-03-04 00:45:53 Givng up bump stocks not "diving" on anything. The 2A wasn't meant to take away our common sense ! Even the 2A was result of AMENDING our beloved constitution. America First NOT 100% conservative purity first. Reasonable conservatives are OK with 95% purity lacking super majority
1629 2018-03-04 00:45:49 Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks

1630 2018-03-04 00:44:07 gotcha. I sent over some fiat before realizing they aren't allowing btc purchases from my state yet so bought some stocks right before they crashed. lol
1631 2018-03-04 00:43:47 It’s all starting to come to light. Kushner and trump made deals with the saudis to enrich themselves.  And look at the money grabs by his friends manipulating steel stocks.
1632 2018-03-04 00:42:23 It will be long-term. Crypto markets are still in the infancy stage similar to tech stocks in 1999. Not saying this is a bubble for all of crypto, but eventually inferior tech will lose. Can’t prop up the prices forever.
1633 2018-03-04 00:42:18 Spelling bee proctor: “Your word is Coincidence”

1634 2018-03-04 00:41:51 Par contre, je commence sérieusement à faire des stocks. Me manque plus ou moins que des nouveaux vêtements (parce que trois t-shirts dont deux trop courts, et trois jeans, c'est déjà chaud pour une semaine, alors deux...)
1635 2018-03-04 00:41:25 You said you would ban bump stocks....why haven't you?

1642 2018-03-04 00:36:43 Bump stocks need to be banned.  Yes, it is a great defensive weapon, especially for the inexperienced, as you point out it is easy to learn and use.  And it has been used successfully in self defense.  Ranchers use them for large predators.  And some hunt large game with them.
1643 2018-03-04 00:36:42 Stock market is important to the 1%. Not many common ppl buy and sell stocks so it's a safe distractions to what he really wants to cove up. Jared and Ivanka collusion and pay for play.
1644 2018-03-04 00:36:11 could #trump #tariff announcement simply be a ruse to enrich himself or others? is it possible that a trump confidant made millions conveniently dumping steel stocks in anticipation of trump's blather on tariffs?
1645 2018-03-04 00:36:02 And you keep bringing up bump stocks even though the only shooter who used it was the Vegas shooter other weapons can do the same amount of damage. Just like in columbine and in Austin Texas in 1966

1649 2018-03-04 00:32:34 I hate this whole administration so don't get me wrong here, but the commerce department recommended tariffs 2 weeks ago, and maybe he sold stocks based on that? Idk.

1653 2018-03-04 00:22:16 Trump just said he thinks it's great that the Chinese president has essentially become a dictator, and that he hopes we can do that one day

There's only a few days after taking guns 1st, 2nd due process, Banning assault rifles, writing out bump stocks no matter what
1654 2018-03-04 00:21:53 So getting rid of bump stocks will stop shootings. Riiiiigghhhtt. That's like getting rid of blunt wraps to stop drug cartels
1655 2018-03-04 00:20:59 Huge cap stocks have been plummeting the past few days. 500 of the world’s richest people have lost a total of 107 billion dollars combined
1656 2018-03-04 00:20:05 Seriously, imagine Barack Obama saying we should take guns first, have due process second, ban assault rifles, and that he's riding bump stuck stocks out regardless of what Congress does, and then said these appalling words

The hypocrisy is absolutely stunning
1657 2018-03-04 00:19:52 But steel stocks have gone up in value !! So nothing was done wrong!! Sorry to disappoint.
1658 2018-03-04 00:19:11 Did you tip off any friends to dump millions on EU car stocks before you tweeted?
1659 2018-03-04 00:16:04 So, they have drawn the line with that? Or, is it just because it’s not made by gun manufacturers, like bump stocks?

1663 2018-03-04 00:12:54 STOCKS WILL DECLINE IN TROUBLED TIMES:   While its usually best to buy & hold stocks, you can sell & sit on sidelines when things look troubled.  In June 2007 market was at $14,021 when housing collapsed. Two years later in 3/09 it had dropped 55% to a low of  $6,470.
1664 2018-03-04 00:11:46 “Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks”    This man hasn’t traded or touched his steel stock since 2015, but one week before Trump announced steel tariffs, he sells all.
1665 2018-03-04 00:11:22 Time to invest in net-making stocks.

1668 2018-03-04 00:10:19 10% of the people own 80% of the stocks. What do they care what the Economist says. They want good paying, family supporting jobs. That's why Trump is president. The Dems gave them welfare. Trump promises to return their self-respect with good manufacturing, wealth creating  jobs

1670 2018-03-04 00:09:47 @attorneygeneral @PressSec Guess what? Just before trumpnuts announced his ill conceived steel tariffs (after his ill thought through reaction to Jar Jar failing the security smell test) Trump's advisor dumped his steel stocks. Insider- snake-trading, special counsel please.

1721 2018-03-03 23:48:15 It's really alarming that Icahn dumped his steel company stocks... obviously, given a heads up about the Steel tariffs by Wilbur Ross. Alarming since some of us are saying it's going to wreck our economy, and the stock dumping tells us, they KNOW it will & are doing it anyway.

1731 2018-03-03 23:36:52 Take all your money and put it in gun stocks...they will literally boom if any threat of ban
1732 2018-03-03 23:35:30 There is definitely a bond bubble that can hurt stocks, but the recession would only be on paper. These are different economic times and won’t follow the old rules.
1733 2018-03-03 23:33:40 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
1734 2018-03-03 23:31:54 @jimcramer I reviewed my food stocks after re-watching your $CAG segment and wanted to mention $ADM.  When you hear $ADM, do you also reminisce about Louis Rukeyser? I miss that guy.
1735 2018-03-03 23:31:49 Didn’t steel stocks go up when the announcement was made, normally you buy before the news
1736 2018-03-03 23:30:44 Fight me
1737 2018-03-03 23:29:53 I like cheap stocks but wondering how much time we have. Ray dahlio said there is a 70% chance of recession in the next two years, that means this could be the beginning of a recession and not just cheap stocks.
1738 2018-03-03 23:29:04 Who would've imagined that you'd become somebody who loudly beats the drums For #War?
Your sabre rattling is disgusting!
Your service to the establishment and the military industrial complex hasnt gone unnoticed.
Save your money because your stocks plummeting

1739 2018-03-03 23:28:10 Time to lock up Icahn. If Martha can spend time in jail for unloading stocks, so can he. I'm for equal treatment here. Maybe he can learn to knit. #ShameontheGOP #TrumpsFriendscangotoJail
1740 2018-03-03 23:27:02 Oh hell no lol, thought you were talking stocks nevermind
1741 2018-03-03 23:24:41 In your opinion, what will end up being the Top #Cannabis #Stocks of 2018? What will your opinion be based on? Share price on January 1st vs. December 31st or based on Gain% from Low to High, even if it's a P&D from 0.0001 to 0.005?
1742 2018-03-03 23:24:38 Big time stupid unless of course he's helping people the likes of Carl Icahn who dumped his steel stocks a week ahead of his announcement. Still stupid but you know what I mean.
1743 2018-03-03 23:23:57 I absolutely think the AR-15 should be available, and even the M4 and M16. I think bump stocks are really stupid but I don’t think they should be banned. Maybe (specifically) bump stocks should be regulated like an NFA item, like an M4 or M16 would be.
1744 2018-03-03 23:23:25 Truth be told, I'm half trying to sell this domain/website & Twitter account because life has been too hectic. But, I still do think $OWCP has great potential in 2018 -- if management delivers expected news/updates.

Top Stock? Depends on ones trading/investment strategy, IMO.
1745 2018-03-03 23:22:44 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
1746 2018-03-03 23:21:24 That is true Meredith, and I am not imposed on more astringent background checks; I am also in favor of the elimination of " bump stocks," as they serve no purpose and which the President wants banned as well.
1747 2018-03-03 23:20:58 I think Trump should be chgd SECURITY FRAUD.Tariffs was campaign promise,but I know Carl Ichan sold and others Energy Stocks..Trump alerted them so cud dump @smerconish
1748 2018-03-03 23:20:39 The gun debate has once again been taken over by politicians pandering in an election year. Raise the age, eliminate bump stocks, increase background checks, require continuing education, and introduce mental health screenings. #ProtectOurKids #NRA #ParklandStudents
1749 2018-03-03 23:18:38 Not nonsense .. was a subtweet...what do tech stocks have to do with tariffs?
1750 2018-03-03 23:18:36 @Grimecraft smokes comb of dandruff stocks .
1751 2018-03-03 23:17:33 About to learn about STOCKS 
1752 2018-03-03 23:15:50 My bank account is GREAT and so are my stocks. Being fiscally conservative and not a slave to fads enabled me to retire at the age of 45. What are the Dems doing to help you with that? Nothing because they need you to be dependent on social programs
1753 2018-03-03 23:15:50 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your fibromyalgia
1754 2018-03-03 23:13:43 So, “more than 80 percent of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population.”  Remind me, what percentage of Federal income taxes does that same 10 percent actually pay?  Is 70% not enough?
1755 2018-03-03 23:12:08 Nope. We’re staying and fighting and we will win! 
You can keep your handguns, hunting rifles and shotguns but bump stocks, high cap magazines, AR’s and Russian Puppet tRUmp have got to go.
1756 2018-03-03 23:12:06 When did Carl Icahn get the idea to dump his Steel stocks? And why is Mr. Shit for Brains President trying to get his Racist Chief of Staff to fire his own daughter and her husband? File a FOIA document on those two things, OK?
1757 2018-03-03 23:11:55 Bump stocks are garbage anyway you don't need a law any qualified shooter will know that that s***
1758 2018-03-03 23:10:09 My newsagent stocks 1 per day & it rarely sells.
1759 2018-03-03 23:10:04 Limiting guns isn’t going to fix anything it’s a mental heath issue and frankly a failure of law enforcement and FBI to follow up on the most direct evidence. Sensible limits like background checks and eliminate bump stocks you cannot force your agenda on law abiding gun owners
1760 2018-03-03 23:08:39 Maybe ha has stocks in corporations that make war equipment.
1761 2018-03-03 23:07:12 @HBOboxing is slacking and even when they put on a good fight— like the Kovalev fight tonight— they put it up against @ShowtimeBoxing which has a better card tonight. 
Back to resource stocks.
1762 2018-03-03 23:05:47 $BTC at key resistance, 11.7k-12k may indicate bull run, retrace could mean a return to 9k... looks like #CRYPTOS are increasingly a hedge against #stocks but don't let that be the only indicator. Personally I'm loaded up for an #altcoin party #cryptocurrencynews #bitcoin #BTC
1763 2018-03-03 23:05:26 So #CarlIcahn dumped $31.3 mil in steel related stocks days before #Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports...hmm seems someone had some insider tip....crooks the whole lot of em'
1764 2018-03-03 23:04:47 90+% of American voters are for increased background cks,banning assault style weapons,banning bump stocks etc.
1765 2018-03-03 23:04:47 @ezekiel_boone any problems with stocks of Zero Day in the UK? Preordered HC beginning of November and keep getting emails from vendor pushing back on delivery
1766 2018-03-03 23:04:14 He can use the money he pulled out of the steel industry stocks.

1771 2018-03-03 23:00:30 As a value investor, you get paid for doing uncomfortable things like buying stocks that everyone hates. #DeepValue #ContrarianValue
1772 2018-03-03 23:00:03 The water will be off in the area's below within minutes. Please ensure that you have sufficient stocks until 8am Tomorrow.
1773 2018-03-03 22:59:54 People think they have to talk loudly because the cell phone is so small; how could they possibly hear you otherwise?  That and everyone has their earbuds cranked up to eleven (Spinal Tap) and we have several generations of near deaf citizens. Buy hearing-aid stocks.
1774 2018-03-03 22:59:30 Well for starters just this week he had a buddy dump his steel stocks right before he announced tariffs, his Panama hotel is under investigation for sex trafficking, his HUD secretary bought a $30k+ dining table on taxpayers money & Javanka can’t even pass a security clearance
1775 2018-03-03 22:58:45 Equity needs to live beyond real estate and stocks to reside in the D&I market portfolio where it's been evicted, foreclosed & shorted.

1784 2018-03-03 22:53:41 That is criminal.  He should have had it at least in a nice basket of dividend stocks.  Savings accounts pay nothing.
1785 2018-03-03 22:52:59 As stocks diminish ocean mining will become by necessity, more aggressive and irrepressible as panic overtakes reasonable people of the world.
1786 2018-03-03 22:50:53 I’ve invested around these dishonorable thieves for years, but avoid their den of iniquity. All stocks, including $PDXP are subject to their lies   and deceit. It’s a matter of where we go from here and how we end their unethical behavior.
1787 2018-03-03 22:50:38 Thanks to all who mentioned the small cap dividend stocks tonight  I’m going to look through them tomorrow 
1788 2018-03-03 22:49:05 Unlucky boys can see the disappointment in your faces hard going when you have players out like @FifeFlyers @nucci39 @RussMoyer @C_Schaber @Chadmister10 @jjorgensen15 @Marrsy33 @PeteyL88 @CharlieMosey @TheHorseTM @Stocks_68 on to the next one boys
1789 2018-03-03 22:48:49 IS being done, folks have been making them, Plenty of bump stocks & bump devices. Plenty of videos of them being made & used. 3D printing is low cost + 3D metal printing prices coming down. Search 3D pistols or Ghost Gunner that is the AR15 lower. Bans=marginally effective @ best

1791 2018-03-03 22:47:05 Share holders win! If you think it sucks, but CISCO STOCK. Cisco is in many ETF’s and targeted stock mutual funds in America. Americans wealth increases. The rich are not the only ones that own mutual funds, ETF’s & stocks. #MakingAmericaRichAgain
1792 2018-03-03 22:46:25 + Universal background checks
+ Reverse rule banning CDC & other agencies from studying gun violence 
+ Ban magazines holding more than 10 bullets
+ Assault weapons ban
+ Ban bump stocks/trigger acceleration devices
+ Ban any device specifically made to adapt weapons to auto
1793 2018-03-03 22:46:19 Clearly Brokaw you don't know DICK about business. 

Remember you guys had the DOW falling thru the floor. "Sell your stocks" election night. How'd that work out.

Trump is maneuvering thru the mother of all cesspool's.

He has to work w/a crowd bought/paid for the last 50 yrs.
1794 2018-03-03 22:45:45 « Bien sûr que je le sais.

1795 2018-03-03 22:45:36 And Carl Ichan sold $31M worth of steel stocks last week. 
I guess sell ‘em high buy them low (but also whisper seeds of bad policy into the President’s ear) will make him richer.
1796 2018-03-03 22:44:50 Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, raise buying age to 21, limit magazine size and sales, waiting periods, no internet and gun show loopholes, fix background checks, no excuses.  #GunReformNow @senmarcorubio @SenBillNelson @SenateMajLdr #NeverAgain #NotOneMore@SpeakerRyan
1797 2018-03-03 22:44:19 "gun violence protection orders, domestic violence, background checks, “strawman” gun purchases, armor-piercing ammunition, and bump stocks".
Sounds like a great start.  No one should have an issue with these,
1798 2018-03-03 22:43:54 Tell me that Icahn did not have inside info. His sale of steel stocks is no coincidence
1799 2018-03-03 22:43:08 STOCKS - HOLD?
PROS:
- GOP PACs supporting
- World/US economy ok 
- Investor Complacency 
- Stock buybacks
- Stimulus?
CONS:
- Trade wars?
- Strained foreign relationships 
- Trump unpredictability/ Mueller
- Higher interest rates
- Growing deficits
- Mixed economy?

1800 2018-03-03 22:42:35 Hmmmm... No, not Billions. But, I know what you're talking about though. The woman who still won't dump her stocks until they're worth *zero*... Yes?
1801 2018-03-03 22:42:22 Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, raise buying age to 21, limit magazine size and sales, waiting periods, no internet and gun show sales loopholes, no excuses. #NotOneMore #GunReformNow @RandPaul @senmarcorubio @SenBillNelson @SenateMajLdr #NeverAgain @CoachP_CHS
1802 2018-03-03 22:41:55 @TheBackPage did you see Carl Icahn saved 31 million dollars by dumping stocks of a company heavily dependent on steel 4 days before Trump announced the tariffs. He hadn’t sold one share of that company in over 4 years.
1803 2018-03-03 22:41:30 Will the corporations buying back their stocks at record  valuations prove to be the ultimate dumb money?
1804 2018-03-03 22:40:32 @CoachP_CHS @LindaStewartFL Let’s agree on banning bump stocks, and banning what most reasonable people consider as assault weapons. Raise the age to 21 to buy any gun. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultRifles #limitammo @FLGovScott
1805 2018-03-03 22:39:19 Does Hull not have a fishing interest? Our fishing industry will be revitalised and the fish stocks nurtured instead of electrified after March 2019. But Labour are not interested in the fortunes of the workers.
1806 2018-03-03 22:38:02 I’m long WEAT etf. Most of global  stocks are held by China and unavailable to rest of world/ so oversupply not as big as consensus says imo.

1811 2018-03-03 22:34:37 @tweetbot please add ability to mute stocks, just like you have the ability to mute hashtags
1812 2018-03-03 22:34:30 “Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks”    This man hasn’t traded or touched his steel stock since 2015, but one week before Trump announced steel tariffs, he sells all.
1813 2018-03-03 22:34:20 Surely you have to prosecute those who buy a gun illegally anyway? What about no sale of large magazines, bump stocks, raising the minimum age, closing loopholes at gun shows?
1814 2018-03-03 22:34:04 Trump tariffs could emerge as a black swan event for stocks, long-time bull Jeff Saut warns...
1815 2018-03-03 22:34:00 Hey, Your billionaire buddy just made millions from selling steel stocks a week before your annoucement. What say you?
1816 2018-03-03 22:33:55 A Trump friend and "former" advisor sells off $31 million in steel-related stocks days before @realDonaldTrump announces his steel tariffs? Nothing suspicious about that at all, right? #facts #trump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
1817 2018-03-03 22:33:30 GOLD!  Stocks, Bitcoin, even CASH can become worthless overnight.  If you don't have a stash of Gold (or silver if you can't afford it), you're risking more than you know.
1818 2018-03-03 22:33:28 Ahhh couldve beaten void but i did my job taking 2 stocks 
1819 2018-03-03 22:30:22 5) p2) But I wholeheartedly agree on no bump stocks. As I mentioned before, you can own a fully-automatic (or a short barrel rifle/shotgun), but it requires tax stamp, thorough background check and registration. Also forgot - ATF approval too. So a bump stock is cheating.
1820 2018-03-03 22:30:13 I love it...time to load up on cheap(er) stocks!
1821 2018-03-03 22:29:07 Just rewatched The Big Short, a reminder that groupthink leads to bad ideas - don't follow the market, buy when others are selling! #stocks

1823 2018-03-03 22:27:10 Brazilian Stocks  Sentiment from news is -0.1402
1824 2018-03-03 22:25:58 Common sense gun control.  Tough background checks. Ban the AR-15 & all military-style weapons like it.  Ban bump stocks & high capacity ammo clips.  Stop it BEFORE it happens so NO ONE HAS TO DIE.
1825 2018-03-03 22:24:17 Wow, war is always good for the  Repugnants party I guess, after all they all own stocks in weapons and munitions so they just get richer!

1829 2018-03-03 22:23:31 Can I have just one (1) tournament with regular night sleep Zzz..? 
Don't know If I played well today.. probably didn't. I fucking suck at some match ups such as toon link, luigi and lucas.. the problem usually is that I cannot clutch the stocks and end up dead by up smash etc.
1830 2018-03-03 22:22:21 Funny my 401k was up 300% under Obama.  If yours wasn’t you need a new advisor.  And if yours is telling you to stay in stocks during a trade war they are playing you for a fool.
1831 2018-03-03 22:21:42 SMH Those that voted Trump in, aren't you so tired of #winning yet? #delusional the whole lot of you. This will only get worse, watch how the #Tarriffs will effect our stocks, and relationships all around the world. We look pretty damn shitty already. That's your #IdiotinChief !
1832 2018-03-03 22:21:23 And he'll do the executive order on bump stocks, a move almost everyone likes.  He'll end up being the only one who got something done.
1833 2018-03-03 22:20:30 Yes. And the #msd kids & all voters need an outline of what is required from politicians & a plan for a sensible, inclusive (but not the NRA/Koch Bros) gun reform process & immediate - bans on bump stocks, background checks for all sales, domestic violence and threats of violence
1834 2018-03-03 22:20:21 used the wrong cloud stocks
1835 2018-03-03 22:18:06 For the richest Americans and biggest corporations. Right now big corporations are using their landfall decreased taxes to buy back their own stocks.
1836 2018-03-03 22:17:52 would anyone like to educate me on stocks?
1837 2018-03-03 22:17:37 Just watched this weeks gogglebox and the fact half of them don’t even know who kylie Jenner is or why she’s impacted snapchats stocks is hilarious 
1838 2018-03-03 22:17:36 Quotas were introduced by the CFP as fishermen were over-fishing and using ever larger trawlers to catch too much fish. The CFP protects fish stocks sustainably.
1839 2018-03-03 22:17:13 Since #GOPe allowed #Neocon's to SELL out #WeThePeople to the highest #Globalist Multi-National corp bidder stocks are UP 2,500%+ while REAL WAGES of WORKERS are WORTH LESS THAN HALF what they were in 1970: FACT= #Tariff Protects/CREATS Local #Jobs & Stimulates Economic Growth
1840 2018-03-03 22:16:02 Question for all: As you may have heard, Massachusetts has made bump stocks illegal. I was hoping to find someone in the greater Lowell area who owns a bump stock and would share their thoughts about this legislation. Msg me here or email me at acurtis@lowellsun.com.
1841 2018-03-03 22:15:10 Warren Buffett will tell you Hell Yes!!!  When stocks plunge, smart investors go on a buying spree.
1842 2018-03-03 22:14:40 You've been living off the glory of that great OWCP pick for a long time. Its now March 2018. Are you even going to bother having a 2018 pick this year? OWCP hasn't exactly been very good for several months. Just down, flat, down.
1843 2018-03-03 22:12:56 Looking at that, the cost of ammo should go up as well as banning bump stocks.
1844 2018-03-03 22:10:07 Trump's former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks while Trump took a dump on America.
1845 2018-03-03 22:09:25 @Carl_C_Icahn little heads up to dump your steel stocks????
1846 2018-03-03 22:08:44 Washington Post: Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks.
@washingtonpost
1847 2018-03-03 22:08:37 If he's worried about the markets fluctuating he may want to get in slowly like a monthly deposit. As long as his risk tolerance supports moving from bonds to stocks then this would work well. Don't try to time the market though, that's always a losing battle
1848 2018-03-03 22:08:24 Yen bullish because of uncertainty same for maybe gold and Swissie 

Euro not so much but I wonder how it can be anything other than bad for the USD 

Aussie depends on what stocks and risk aversion do.
1849 2018-03-03 22:08:24 Yes. That’s why the #msd kids need an outline of what is required from politicians & a plan for a sensible, inclusive (but not the NRA or Koch Bros) gun reform process & immediate - bans on bump stocks, background checks for all sales, domestic violence and threats of violence
1850 2018-03-03 22:06:53 Should Trump stop proposing gun regulations like the ban on bump stocks #GunContolNow #GunControlNever #2ndAmendment
1851 2018-03-03 22:06:45 I have yet to see you support one successfully. You resort to attacks so  you haven’t convinced me nor changed anyone else’s mind. In fact, you supported my original assertion about bump stocks and age limits - gun control measures they’re currently considering. :)
1852 2018-03-03 22:05:44 The point isn't my money, the point is gun/ammo stocks go up when gun control comes up. If the point is to have fewer guns in society these demonstrations/protests in the wake of atrocities are having the opposite effect. "At least they're doing something" is nonsense
1853 2018-03-03 22:05:23 There's another one now..white house insider trading. His former campaign advisor and billionaire best friend  who just happens to own stocks in steel just conveniently knew to sell his shares in  a company days before the tariffs and saved millions
1854 2018-03-03 22:04:50 And when do you think he's going to do ANYTHING for the regular Americans? You people should be ashamed of yourself. Now that your stocks are making you multimillionaires, you're just starting to see how he's one by one dismantling our government and our safety nets? For shame.
1855 2018-03-03 22:04:03 If I look at my biggest mistakes over those two decades, they all involved selling stocks like CELG and ALXN too early because I thought they had gotten "expensive." Mistakes like that don't make as much impact on the psyche as the crashes, so they are easy to overlook.
1856 2018-03-03 22:03:47 You literally took the words out of my mouth Tony! Trade world war is just what we need right now after Trump dumped his stocks. Robert Mueller is coming for you!
1857 2018-03-03 22:03:32 Les korogus sont tellement adorables, j’ai pas le cœur à ne pas leur acheter tous leurs stocks de champignons D: #BreathOfTheWild
1858 2018-03-03 22:02:19 That just scared the crap out of me. I'm a little shaken up lately... But Jesus. Do we know how many of the shooters, if any, used bump stocks?
1859 2018-03-03 22:01:56 I will pay to watch a bunch of 2A yahoos take on a tyrannical govt. Good luck with your ar-15s and bump stocks against tanks, drones, helicopters and JSFs. 2A doesn't protect you against the govt.
1860 2018-03-03 22:01:44 He would have made a ton more $$ if he had waited until the announcement...steel stocks spiked that day In a big way.
1861 2018-03-03 22:01:38 京都行きます
1862 2018-03-03 22:01:01 Don't forget the high capacity bump stocks!!!
1863 2018-03-03 22:00:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
1864 2018-03-03 21:58:49 In the stocks and made to smoke spice.
1865 2018-03-03 21:58:31 major trades on any other stocks. Remember part of Carl’s insight revolves around that Icahn, a man who made billions with hostile takeovers, was spooked by the market.
This is a man who bought @herbalife to keep it afloat when he knew it was a pyramid scheme to take out a
1866 2018-03-03 21:58:22 How can you have any confidence in #FoxNews so-called financial news "Journalist" @CGasparino when 2 weeks ago he's BLAMING @POTUS for luring retail investors into buying stocks when the market was so OVERPRICED ... but NOW he's blaming the selloff on @POTUS Steel import #Tariffs
1867 2018-03-03 21:57:40 @dukelarby So how did Icahn know that would be Trump's specific reaction to Kushner losing his security clearance before dumping his stocks? Can't be a coincidence.
1868 2018-03-03 21:56:53 Legislators supported by Nebraska’s Governor Ricketts, heir 2 billions, trying to do this in Nebraska-this same cadre of GOPpers also refused to ban bump stocks in state
1869 2018-03-03 21:55:59 Amazing!
1870 2018-03-03 21:55:28 More than 80% of Americans support:
-universal background checks
-Making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks
- banning bump stocks 
-Preventing sales of all firearms to people who have been convicted of violent misdemeanors
1871 2018-03-03 21:54:51 #GOPJulie wants to throw shade at her opponent, but won't answer questions on whether she supports commonsense gun legislation. @killian4senate do you support banning bump stocks, enhanced background checks, ERPO, and funding a state firearm violence research institute?
1872 2018-03-03 21:53:43 Good. 

These weapons are not the problem. Screening, bump stocks and the school system are the problem.
1873 2018-03-03 21:53:17 après je sais pa si tu vas la trouver bc je l’avais commandé en novembre et je sais qu’ils renouvellent souvent les stocks donc tient moi au courant 
1874 2018-03-03 21:52:15 It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks--those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.
1875 2018-03-03 21:51:35 You won’t lose your money as often as when you invest in crypto currency is what I’m saying. Their stocks are among the most volatile available
1876 2018-03-03 21:51:08 So, now only the small businesses are the engines of our economy?  What happened to the big dogs in this fight?  Oh yeah, they're cutting jobs, buying back stocks, paying little to no tax, and moving operations to OTHER COUNTRIES! Just ask KCC employees. They'll tell you!
1877 2018-03-03 21:50:55 You’re talking about the “risk” of investing in BTC, the risk involved is losing your money. If you invest in “real” stocks you can lose your money as well.
1878 2018-03-03 21:50:34 Do you need any more evidence? Trump is manipulating the stock market only, and have shortened his and mates metals stocks.... Mueller follow the money....This egomaniac will do anything to cash in on the presidency.
1879 2018-03-03 21:50:12 Please track who starts to buy up those stocks just before Trump eventually backs off these tariff talks.
1880 2018-03-03 21:47:57 "The bill, SB 7026, imposes a three-day waiting period on rifle sales, increases the age limit for rifle sales from 18 to 21 years old and bans “bump stocks” which modify a semiautomatic weapon to allow it to fire more rapidly."
1881 2018-03-03 21:47:56 I wouldn't worry about bump stocks or guns..we have far greater concerns & security threats to our nation when our society has been hit by all the leftist supported anti human & USA agenda that got us to this point. Guns are not the prob the people are who committ the crimes are
1882 2018-03-03 21:47:50 I'm as cross as a bear about it. I need to see who did it & their parents. Bring back the stocks, I'll provide the rotten eggs.
1883 2018-03-03 21:47:49 If you have the capabilities with your financial advisor or retirement funds, make sure you are not investing in US public gun stocks that fund the NRA: AOBC, RGR, VSTO, and OLN #BoycottNRA #NeverAgain
1884 2018-03-03 21:46:26 Ummm let's see. 
Silence after Parkland shooting.
Saying he's in favor of banning bump stocks (FINALLY) only to have his mind changed for him 18 hours later. Belittling anyone without the tRump name! Putting our country at risk for the sake of NRA and Putin! Get over it!
1885 2018-03-03 21:45:42 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your fibromyalgia
1886 2018-03-03 21:45:23 This is amazing! @Tom_Stocks maybe it’s one you can share via @actorawareness.
1887 2018-03-03 21:45:20 @McGheesBakery please tell me who stocks your amazing fruit scones in Glasgow other than the coop supermarkets???
1888 2018-03-03 21:45:01 Limiting guns isn’t going to fix anything it’s a mental heath issue and frankly a failure of law enforcement and FBI to follow up on the most direct evidence. Sensible limits like background checks and eliminate bump stocks you cannot force your agenda on law abiding gun owners
1889 2018-03-03 21:43:28 The noose is getting tighter, “ready the stocks”
1890 2018-03-03 21:42:28 A short request list from #Penzance #foodbank this week. If you can help please put jam & tinned veg in collection bins, found in most supermarkets and corner shops. The food bank currently has good stocks of dog & cat food, sanitary items, baked beans and porridge. Thank you.
1891 2018-03-03 21:42:12 The economy is being held up by debt and inflation, the rise in the stocks shows consumer confidence under Trump, which is positive but the economy is far from being "robust and thriving".
1892 2018-03-03 21:42:07 Come on 30bps to own a basket of 5237 stocks sounds so.....lazy
1893 2018-03-03 21:41:51 Limiting guns isn’t going to fix anything it’s a mental heath issue and frankly a failure of law enforcement and FBI to follow up on the most direct evidence. Sensible limits like background checks and eliminate bump stocks but u cannot force your agenda on law abiding gun owners
1894 2018-03-03 21:40:25 It better hit because if the Dems lose when historically the party opposite the President wins, they will most definitely be laughing stocks...even more then they are now.  Watch Nancy Pelosi try to talk,  and you will see how the straight people in the world see stoners.
1895 2018-03-03 21:40:24 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1896 2018-03-03 21:40:18 By and large, so long as you don't buy when stocks are egregiously overvalued, you should be ok in the long run. Doesn't always work out that way but nothing is certain.
1897 2018-03-03 21:40:06 Limiting guns isn’t going to fix anything it’s a mental heath issue and frankly a failure of law enforcement and FBI to follow up on the most direct evidence. Sensible limits like background checks and eliminate bump stocks but cannot force your agenda on law abiding gun owners
1898 2018-03-03 21:39:09 @realDonaldTrump   Trump sold millions in steel stocks just before announcing tariffs. 
 “A former adviser to President Trump sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days before the president announced hefty tariffs on foreign-made steel.”
1899 2018-03-03 21:37:57 "THERES NO CUSTOMERS HERE." STARES AT THE STOCKS.

....

"THERE HASN'T BEEN A N Y BUSINESS FROM THE WHOLE TIME WEVE BEEN G O N E!!"
1900 2018-03-03 21:37:51 And you would consider Pelosi, maxie watters, kamala harris, etc genius'? The are total laughing stocks and are liberals' stars. Now that is hysterical.
1901 2018-03-03 21:37:43 Ok time to sorting USA stocks and eu indices again, when ever this man talks like this stock market goes down.
1902 2018-03-03 21:37:37 Yes it is a gun issue.

Ban the AR15 and any ling ruffle that can be moded. 
Ban clips larger than 10 rounds. 
Ban bump stocks.

#wellregulated
1903 2018-03-03 21:37:21 I Cahn job with steel stocks.  

And now there is Qatar, who nobody could figure out for the travel ban.  They said “No” to Junior...

1909 2018-03-03 21:34:39 Piccadilly Gardens is now an eyesore.
Everyone involved in every planning decision over the last 30 years should be placed in stocks in Piccadilly Gardens and shit thrown at them !
Gary Neville could of done better and he's a twat.

1911 2018-03-03 21:32:28 On one hand as an adult with real bills, it’s hard to justify $30 for MP3’s. On the other hand, I made excuses to spend more than that on sneakers/clothes/stocks/etc so it’s all about associating the cost of music relative to things you WOULD spend that on
1912 2018-03-03 21:31:55 And his ex-financial Advisor Carl Icahn made $31Million off selling Steal Related Stocks two days before @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Steal Tariff Announcement. How convenient or was it an Illegal tip off @SEC_News ?
1913 2018-03-03 21:31:54 Remember how Chump wrote out bump stocks

Oh yeah that didn't happen
1914 2018-03-03 21:30:22 SHOULD YOU HOLD STOCKS IN TROUBLED TIMES?   I'm not.  When market began falling in 2007, people were told to sit tight.  In June 07 stock market was at $14,021.  Two years later in 3/09 it had dropped 55% to a low of $6,470 due to housing collapse.  Been better to sit that out.
1915 2018-03-03 21:30:04 AR 15 w/ bump stock. All bump stocks Trump has tasked DOJ to ban immediately. AR it is a useful small caliber platform. Hundreds of thousands out there. One thot is eliminate lethality with fixed limited magazines. Reload would take min not secs..a VERY long time in a gun fight.
1916 2018-03-03 21:28:37 It takes a lot of hutzpah to say avoid Amazon while being wrong on stocks. Like it or not Amazon’s strategies have worked including the smart acquisition of RING. Watch the impact of that acquisition.
1917 2018-03-03 21:27:35 "LOOK AT WHAT THOSE LITTLE BRATS DID TO MY PIZZERIA.

OH MY GOD WHAT ARE THE STOCKS???"
1918 2018-03-03 21:27:25 Why isn’t the SEC investigating Icahn for insider trading with @realDonaldTrump administration after dumping steel stocks prior to tariff announcement? #corrupt #LockHimUp
1919 2018-03-03 21:26:52 Buying your stocks and bonds is good for you.
1920 2018-03-03 21:26:00 I'd have to pay an immense amount of fees to trade EU stocks. Not worth it for $50 of stock.
1921 2018-03-03 21:24:43 Assume much? Is that the most he's ever made a year? Does he invest in stocks? Inherit money? What does his wife do? 
He's a lawyer who graduated from the University of WA and Willamette University and he's 67 years old.
1922 2018-03-03 21:24:26 Ryan learned his economics at Ayn Rand School of Screw Everyone else. Already the tax bill he wrote and sold is being used for 1 time bonuses, not permanent pay raises and corps are buying back their stocks and not investing in plant and capital facilities.
1923 2018-03-03 21:22:33 Why isn't playing poker allowed with an AI yet playing on Stocks with unfair advantage is? Because when you place a bet you haven't realized you already got owned.
1924 2018-03-03 21:22:20 Yes, it was & still is cause of how many bullets you can fit in the magazine compared to NO magazine for deer hunting rifles. 

Bump stocks may not have made it an assault rifle before they were made but the fact that you can legally have a 30 round magazine for a rifle is crazy!
1925 2018-03-03 21:22:18 Do you believe our government wouldn’t give a damn about fish stocks and carry on, our government can change laws a lot quicker than the EU can, how long did it take for them to change the rules on discards
1926 2018-03-03 21:21:25 after emailing 3 times that their online stocks shows they have no stock, they have corrected it and it now shows stock. woo ordering kbd fabric.

1928 2018-03-03 21:20:57 What about the gun show loophole? And limiting guns to mental people who are dangerous? And bump stocks? This is not too much to ask.
1929 2018-03-03 21:19:44 Dear @andrewnabbout from.every jets supporter we hope tou atleast w8 till we win the league on may 5 b4 you leave as your stocks will go up more and you deserve it & when u move back 2 newy when u retire  youll never have to buy a drink inthis town ever again sincerely supporters
1930 2018-03-03 21:19:24 What? I'm being specific. There's no point trying to talk about something without having the correct information. If there's no difference then why are they extremely regulated? and why are people trying to ban bump stocks?
1931 2018-03-03 21:19:17 The NRA says they are “freedoms safest place” then they said we “should look at banning pump stocks” not ok guys. We don’t budge, we have been sacrificing our rights since 1934!!
1932 2018-03-03 21:16:59 Buying and selling stocks ahead of Trump announcement. HOW? #THEBEAT #AMJOY #CNNSOTU
1933 2018-03-03 21:15:52 More money in their pockets!! They own large stocks in the Arms manufacturing.
1934 2018-03-03 21:15:35 The reason I now have an issue with the NRA, is because they wanted to ban bump stocks. I don’t own one but I would never want to stop anyone from owning one. It should be their choice not the gov. The NRA proposed the banning of bump stocks. Not everyone can afford a $utomatic
1935 2018-03-03 21:14:43 Really if bump stocks had been banned would we have had the Vegas shooting still? If we ban assault rifles are school shootings going to cease? We need to protect our second amendment from the root of all evil, government.
1936 2018-03-03 21:14:30 To clarify: Martha Stewart went to jail when her advisor told her about bad news and she sold 230k in stocks.

Long-time trump advisor Carl Icahn just dumped $32,000,000 in stock that is RELIANT ON STEEL IMPORTS, RIGHT BEFORE trump announced the tariffs. 

Cronyism at its finest.
1937 2018-03-03 21:13:26 Here's a retail investor droppin' knowledge on Saturday afternoon on one of my posts: 

"stocks could hit all-time highs across-the-board by Friday because lots of names are on the sale rack and Warren Buffett is down trillions while Putin and China are looking to attack"
1938 2018-03-03 21:13:03 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks slump
1939 2018-03-03 21:12:00 Yes. This is my thought, too. Cracks just are not supporting this gas  build, it seems, yet it keeps coming. Will this dampen gasoline prices  in US? Only way to push higher stocks.  Meanwhile, mid-dis are tight,  increasing price.
1940 2018-03-03 21:10:41 Inside TRADING and it's illegal. We need an investigation as why he knew when to get rid of his stocks!
1941 2018-03-03 21:10:12 If anyone is listening... “Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks”    This man hasn’t traded or touched his steel stock since 2015, but one week before Trump announced steel tariffs, he sells all.
1942 2018-03-03 21:09:21 @FifeFlyers my man of the match tonight is @Stocks_68 
For Storm.... Beca stands out.
1943 2018-03-03 21:09:00 Oh & don't forget @POTUS ex-financial Advisor made $31 Million selling Steal Related Stocks two days prior to his Steal Tariff Announcement. Somebody needs to go to jail over this.
1944 2018-03-03 21:08:52 The answer, apparently, was bump stocks...
1945 2018-03-03 21:08:32 This is just because your friend bought steel stocks. In sure you have too through some sort of shell company.
1946 2018-03-03 21:08:22 His portfolio is probably loaded with MIC stocks. He’d probably make a fortune off another war.
1947 2018-03-03 21:07:57 Sort of like the way it’s addressing assault weapons and bump stocks?
1948 2018-03-03 21:07:43 with each trade saber rattle will come those who want you to panic out and sell the futures or stocks.  I find it annoying to not see the possibility that the EU needs to play ball, too.
1949 2018-03-03 21:07:39 .@SenatorHensley: “We need to repeal the law allowing guns on college campuses. We also need to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines.” #WashingtonDays2018 #ksleg
1950 2018-03-03 21:07:09 Do you have a local store that stocks eyewash
1951 2018-03-03 21:06:39 Words do matter when it comes to the stock market and investors. That’s why when he talks about tariffs, stocks fall. If investors lose confidence in their ability to forecast long term because they don’t know what he really wants to do, they’ll sit on their money.
1952 2018-03-03 21:05:56 Oh wow. Its probably because their stocks went down
1953 2018-03-03 21:05:51 Já bych se spíš zajímal o představitele těch “hodných” stran kteří se volby nezůčastnili a teď pláčou a burcujou na staromák...

1955 2018-03-03 21:04:36 I have been wondering if this "trade war" threat is just a ploy to make stocks go down for a bit, so his family and cronies can profit when he "gives in" to the critics, and "decides not to do something so drastic" after all.
1956 2018-03-03 21:04:28 Hot air.  Ban the AR15, ban bump stocks, universal background checks for ALL sales, red flag national law is a start.
1957 2018-03-03 21:04:09 I want to start investing in stocks 
1958 2018-03-03 21:03:30 #metoo I use to chase them, now I stalk them, their behavior is key, stocks have character’s too. Make money trading stocks by buying them after they have bottomed out and selling them after topping out. I spot tops and bottoms so you don’t have too! #bitcoin
1959 2018-03-03 21:00:14 @grayson_stocks talk to your woman
1960 2018-03-03 20:58:24 I hope my local supermarket stocks the rare ingredients needed for Ethnic cuisine like “garlic” and “peppers”
1961 2018-03-03 20:57:28 He had a bad day so he starts a trade war. - we all lose when stocks go into tailspin this coming week
1962 2018-03-03 20:57:00 No GOP. It said nothing about taking away the second Amendment.  Its about assault rifles, large capacity clips and bump stocks.
1963 2018-03-03 20:56:54 Flay The sun is so much better reply to when we're stocks but because I AM I AINT NO YOUR GRANDMA look like a much greenie
1964 2018-03-03 20:55:19 It goes deeper than bump stocks.  More like Saudi Prince again and gun trafficking 
1965 2018-03-03 20:55:04 No, we all know what the liberals end game is. Taking away guns completelty. It started with fewer bullets in a magazine, then no bump stocks, and next thing you know they are doing a nation wide gun grab. You let them stick their nose in the tent just a little
1966 2018-03-03 20:54:56 I played a train board game where you could short sell stocks and decided the same thing
1967 2018-03-03 20:54:18 17 people were slaughtered in 6 minutes. AR-15s are the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Bump stocks and high capacity mags are often accessories.
1968 2018-03-03 20:53:29 The only fact he needed was that steel stocks would fall after he tipped off his cronie, Carl Icahn, then made the announcement.
1969 2018-03-03 20:50:52 They well pass the price off to us who buys the item and YOUR stocks go up. Smart move there.
1970 2018-03-03 20:50:44 So I just finished #Salem, I liked it up to the point where they refer to the pillory as the stocks. Errr, no honey...
1971 2018-03-03 20:50:30 Like I said, no proposal that I’ve seen wants existing guns taken. The debate that need to take place is about new sales, background checks and bump stocks. I believe if those areas could be addressed it would be a hugely positive step.
1972 2018-03-03 20:49:57 My response to any shooting now:
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list

1974 2018-03-03 20:49:12 I prefer to buy on strength rather than weakness. The only problem with a fixed % SL is stocks all have different volatility. An 8% stop for a high beta stock will have far higher probability of being hit than a low beta stock. It makes more sense to account for its volatility.

1978 2018-03-03 20:46:29 17 people were slaughtered in 6 min with an AR15.  Why is the weapon of choice for mass shooters not banned or severely restricted? Ditto bump stocks. Ditto hi-cap mags.

After they answer with gibberish, ask this refrain:
What are you going to do about high-kill weapons?
1979 2018-03-03 20:45:24 How did your buddies know to dump their stocks before this big announcement forget impeachment you are about to face jail time crooked trump..
1980 2018-03-03 20:45:03 Stocks...
1981 2018-03-03 20:43:00 GOP is a great tail. Trump flip flops on bump stocks and age limits of assault weapons and GOP does the same. But the same puppeteer in both cases: The NRA. The NRA is not living up to its 501(c) nonprofit standards, which includes betterment of society. #GOPFlipFloppers
1982 2018-03-03 20:42:46 n idk how good it works off the cell phone
1983 2018-03-03 20:42:41 My dad told me this morning that before Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum one of his advisors dumped all his stocks in steel 

Looool that's illegal as fuck

1986 2018-03-03 20:40:13 I stopped listening to traders on Twitter such as Marius. He seems to have fake twitter accounts trying to boost his credibility. I lost money by following his leads. I will just do my own research and treat this like my regular stocks. Read news.
1987 2018-03-03 20:39:03 No I don't think criminals care about laws. I think criminals care about themselves. I said they don't need the semi automatic guns and bump stocks and neither do you.

1992 2018-03-03 20:34:08 And what about Trump's buddy who dumped all his steel stocks just a few days before it was announced about steel tariffs? Did Martha Stewart go to jail for that?
1993 2018-03-03 20:32:57 apparently Carl Ichan sold steel construction stocks a few days before Trump announces tariffs nd those stocks losat massive value .. hmm DC Integrity,  he wanted to clean out the swamp! fill it with Trump friends.
1994 2018-03-03 20:32:46 good luck with that
1995 2018-03-03 20:31:49 No bump stocks or fifty round clips used in the school shooting that I was referring too. Second mentally ill is not relevant unless you consider all who make threats are mentally ill and in that case protocol had that covered as well. Don’t alter reality to fit your agenda.
1996 2018-03-03 20:31:29 Some man shot himself at the #WhiteHouse gate today, we’re toying around with #ColdWar rhetoric and @realDonaldTrump ramps up #TradeWar while stocks plummet. Moment of Zen: #Gridiron Dinner. I’ll be watching live tweets like the freakin’ Super Bowl with my beer and popcorn.
1997 2018-03-03 20:30:53 I'm sure everyone else has already figured this out (hence, last week's price action), but if Trump is serious in his trade rhetoric, stocks have already (or will shortly) put in their high for his term.(Unless Powell is willing and able to deploy his own Plunge Protection Team.)
1998 2018-03-03 20:30:09 One can hope. Did trump himself dump stocks too??
1999 2018-03-03 20:29:27 Hear one of @POTUS ex-financial advisors Carl Icahn made $31 Million selling Steel related Stocks two days before Ur Tariff announcement. How convenient. How much did U get?

2011 2018-03-03 20:18:59 TIP OF THE DAY:  Fast moving, high volume stocks give the opportunity for fast gains.  They also give the opportunity for fast losses.  I prefer to avoid momentum stocks entirely, being in early minimizes risk and gives me a clearer cut exit point.  To each their own of course.

2015 2018-03-03 20:15:05 Trumps friend Carl Ichan sold off his stocks in steel last week, hasn’t touched these stocks since 2015 but suddenly decides to sell right before Trump announces tarif.  Where’s this story @FoxNews? Don’t you think your viewers would want to know this?

2038 2018-03-03 19:54:55 Children have been murdered, parts of the NE USA are under floodwaters, Puerto Rico is still without fully restored power, Putin showed off his new nuclear weapon, stocks are falling -- and Trump is playing golf on our dime. @realDonaldTrump is the Worst. Period.
2039 2018-03-03 19:54:28 Trump going to destroy America with this "trade war" nonsense. Trump probably has stocks in American only companies and is trying to earn an extra buck. What a clown!
2040 2018-03-03 19:54:00 Storage not currently profitable so more unlikely without support. Anything is likely to further interfere with market, such that parties do not take responsibility for supplies in extreme circumstances if the state does like Italy with strategic stocks.
2041 2018-03-03 19:53:38 Like a stocks reaction to earnings reports is a reflection of the comparison of results to projections/expectations, not pure results oriented. Pretty easy concept, actually.

2045 2018-03-03 19:50:17 Why’d you watch CNN to help you make up your mind? It’s almost like you’d already decided. 

Go buy your bump stocks and silencers now. I’m sure that millions of innocents will still be available for you to pick off later.
2046 2018-03-03 19:48:57 But still even in crazy selling on panic many stocks held 50 dma after dipping briefly and then roared back well above 50 dma. Moving average are still very crucial for trading
2047 2018-03-03 19:48:26 To sum it up, This is an entirely bears market in the eneare term as fears rise stocks will fall further & demand for safe haven JPY & Gold will increase further. There is high potential of USDJPY falling down to the 100.00 level. #forex #jpy #gold

2090 2018-03-03 19:29:41 I'm not doing much with crypto right now. Way too bearish for me. Just mostly sticking to stocks until crypto figures itself out. If you wanna get into that, I'll link you the app I use. You'll start with a free stock just to get the feel of it.
2091 2018-03-03 19:27:50 A #Trump #WhiteHouse adviser sold his stocks in #Steel hours before Trump announced the #tariffs. That might involve insider info charges.

2093 2018-03-03 19:26:16 I'm not nec for banning AR-15s, just bump stocks & lg magaznes. I am for requring training, where trainers can fail for red flags, pysch evals where ppl who just haven't commited crime yet, are blocked from easy walmart AR purchase & yet letting sane, trained citizens have them.
2094 2018-03-03 19:23:35 Talk about trading... you and Icahn....hmmm cashed steel stocks b4 you announced tariffs
WE ARE NOT STUPID!!

2096 2018-03-03 19:22:28 Sure, trump probably told him to get rid of them stocks before the tariffs!!
2097 2018-03-03 19:22:21 It is pretty much guaranteed that he would have hit fewer than ~560 people in the same amount of time, esp given the slower firing & considering reload rate, evacuation and time openings for officers to shoot him that weren't present w his multi ARs, bump stocks & large magazines

2102 2018-03-03 19:18:45 If Donald Trump invested all of his inheritance in the Top 50 stocks that day, he would currently be 6 Billion wealthier. And this is true cos I read it on the #internet
2103 2018-03-03 19:18:30 How can I find big brokerage firm's report on indian stocks?
2104 2018-03-03 19:18:19 What? Steel stocks went up after Trump's tariff announcement. If Icahn sold US Steel before the announcement, he lost. And it didnt take a genius to anticipate the announcement either.  Trump ran on unfair trade deals. BTW, I oppose the tariffs #NHPolitics #MAPolitics #RIPolitics
2105 2018-03-03 19:18:10 It’s time to start looking into stocks ..
2106 2018-03-03 19:17:54 "Trump has put most of the money he has invested in the market into so-called value stocks, which tend to do better when the market drops than other companies." -- Fortune Magazine
2107 2018-03-03 19:17:02 If anything, the NRA is a little too soft.  Need to be pushing harder for reciprocity, suppressors and fighting for bump stocks.
2108 2018-03-03 19:17:00 Don’t believe it; everything he does is coldly calculated, so much so that he told his buddy Carl Icahn before he did it so he could unload billions in steel related stocks; surely Trump participates with him in the winnings! Expect a reversal soon!
2109 2018-03-03 19:16:22 If we ban bump stocks. We better tell the criminals they better not use them or else! Or else is right! It is insanity to believe they won't. We just gave criminals a one up on the good guys! Obama even said, "You do not take a knife to a gun fight."
2110 2018-03-03 19:16:04 Did you stocks up om Penguins too?
2111 2018-03-03 19:16:03 If they can’t handle unregulated markets they should gtfo of crypto and go back to traditional stocks.
2112 2018-03-03 19:15:27 And yes I understand bump stocks are an exception to what I just wrote.
2113 2018-03-03 19:13:36 Translation: Sell ALL your stocks on opening bell Monday morning, Trump's taking us all into the toilet with him.

2115 2018-03-03 19:13:09 Trump’s close friend Icahn dumping his stock portfolio of steel related stocks the day before Trump announced tariffs on steel
2116 2018-03-03 19:12:54 You could also say he bought steel stocks before Trump announced new tariffs

2120 2018-03-03 19:11:33 And now this: “shortly before Trump announced tarrifs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks.” I think that’s known as insider trading! Who is going to prosecute this guy?!

2124 2018-03-03 19:09:22 Right, but 'timing' means you are being a trader, not a holder.  I could have done better if I sold my BCH during any one of the pump cycles.  But that is true for a hundred other alts and penny stocks I don't mess with.
2125 2018-03-03 19:09:05 But at least bump stocks were banned.
2126 2018-03-03 19:08:46 Just bought more $BTC at 7800. Should flip back to bullish for at least the short term. Dow Jones Industrial Average looks topped. Crypto should tick up while stocks take a downturn. #coinhype

2128 2018-03-03 19:08:10 Why do you say that?  Don't most millionaires own stocks, bonds, and other investment products?  We will reach a point where not having some bitcoin in your portfolio will be considered irresponsible.  Frankly, I would argue that's already true today even if not everyone knows it
2129 2018-03-03 19:07:24 you know steel stocks jumped way higher on the news right?  So he basically avoided profiting from anything..  Maybe you should tell Mueller

2131 2018-03-03 19:06:35 See article about Trump mentor Carl Icahn dumping some of his metal related stocks shortly before announcement.  These people are so crooked they swallow nails and shit corkscrews.
2132 2018-03-03 19:05:26 The spike in the VIX is a signal to buy stocks to Golub, who found that  the S&P 500 has historically risen an average 6.9 percent three  months after the VIX shows a reading above 25.
2133 2018-03-03 19:04:42 You guys know steel stocks screamed HIGHER after the announcement right?  This was the correct thing to do.  But keep showing your ignorance.

2135 2018-03-03 19:03:38 Steel stocks went up right after the announcement.
2136 2018-03-03 19:03:27 Instead of replying questions on particular stocks you can disclose invest at your risk and have own research. Just share logic of entry and exit once.. replying questions might not stop questions.
2137 2018-03-03 19:02:59 The fact someone close to #Trump dumped 
steel-dependent stocks a week earlier, shows that #Trump was doing it to please one of his donors, surely money is involved. #Trump is very calculative, corrupt, and will do anything for money.
2138 2018-03-03 19:02:50 What new jobs? What bigger paychecks? I only have heard of company closures in my circle of friends and family. Lost jobs and no bigger paycheck. Some have said their stocks have gone up...but then I haven't talked to them since Trump's trade war surprise.
2139 2018-03-03 19:02:48 Los stocks estan geniales!!,yo no los podria hacer pero creo que ya tienes que dejar de hacer siempre con el licuado,en casi todos tus packs veo con licuado y no digo que este mal pero creo que ya es hora de cambiar no?

2141 2018-03-03 19:02:00 I should say partially invested in gun/ammo stocks.
2142 2018-03-03 19:01:58 Isn’t this the 3rd time Blue Bunny has had this problem recently? I don’t think Peter Rabbit or the Easter Bunny are going to be too happy about this, unless, of course, POTUS told them about it 3 days ago like he did Ichan and they were able to dump their stocks for $31 million.
2143 2018-03-03 19:00:31 And why would he do that if he knew? Steel stocks were the only stocks goung up after the tarriff announcement.

2146 2018-03-03 18:59:52 He means “worth it” ....to the war profiteers and to all his holdings of defense industry stocks.  That’s really all the republicans are concerned about.

2155 2018-03-03 18:57:22 It can be both and goes down like this: Trump tells Ichan that if he doesn't get his way at next week's meeting, he's going to do the terrifs. Ichan realizes Trump hasn't gotten his way since election night, dumps the stocks.
2156 2018-03-03 18:57:05 Say this 3 times fast: Icahn sold steel stocks.
If the SEC is still functioning maybe they can check it out.
2157 2018-03-03 18:55:39 When your stocks went up

2159 2018-03-03 18:53:33 Carl Icahn made hundreds of millions trading on info given by dt admin. Latest illegal act: Sold off steel stocks days before his dt insider told him about tariffs. But no charges filed cause he didn't violate unwritten rule: ITWF Insider Trading While Female! Ask Martha Stewart!
2160 2018-03-03 18:52:38 PDAC after parties are great. Come for the free food/stuff and shmoozing with the hotties and old guys with too much money on their hands. Doesn't mean I'm going to buy the stocks they are pushing on me though. Mineral exploration is not my thing.
2161 2018-03-03 18:52:29 Thanks to the NRA, bump stocks are legal, suppressor are legal and semi automatic  weapons are legal. Put them all together and you make one legal automatic weapon.
2162 2018-03-03 18:52:23 Me: watching stocks and researching businesses& their future ventures. 
Also me: Looking at my current job. Tragic.
2163 2018-03-03 18:51:35 Perhaps we should check and see whether Trump and his co-conspirators recently dumped stocks.
2164 2018-03-03 18:51:29 The Tariffs caught the headlines. It was obvious that excess oil production and a  drop in consumption impacted energy stocks. Russian saber rattling spooked the market some more. Record low First-time Unemployment Claims are concerning to the market (1/2)
2165 2018-03-03 18:49:40 This should be along the lines on insider trading maybe not for you but for cronies who dump stocks in advance of your bullshit tweets.  But let me ask you a more serious question: why are you ever unable to do the right thing?
2166 2018-03-03 18:48:31 Another fake news headline. It was not steel stocks.
2167 2018-03-03 18:48:20 Since FTSE100 is 75% foreign earnings. The implication is the 25% which is domestic focused is falling at a dramatic rate, if even a higher nominal earnings in £ from the 75% other stocks cannot prop up the index
2168 2018-03-03 18:47:43 Steel stocks gained $2 billion in market value while the S&P 500 lost about $350 billion on the first day of Trump's tariff war. #Sad #Stupid #TypicalTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
2169 2018-03-03 18:47:06 It was pretty good for psychic Carl Icahn. He just the right time to dump his steel stocks..
2170 2018-03-03 18:46:16 Great show last night! I’m sure #Trump   doesn’t realize it but this period of his presidency, he could undo a lot of wrongs by changing the gun laws. We need Dems to draw up a bill regulating gunammo, bump stocks, s

2173 2018-03-03 18:43:17 Looks like Trump no longer cares about the S&P as his tweets about tariffs are bearish for large cap stocks...
2174 2018-03-03 18:42:10 Did you tell your buddy Carl Icahn about this so he could unload automotive stocks in advance like he did with steel stocks the other day?
2175 2018-03-03 18:42:09 I wish I could believe you. I keep hearing about how wonderful Australia’s “gun control” worked which was really a ban and seizure. I hear stats not just of AR 15 victims but stats of all gun deaths including suicides. Even the bump stock bill included far more than bump stocks.

2182 2018-03-03 18:35:54 Bump stocks can be made at home; how u control that, sir?  Due Process not important to you? That's treason. Age 21 to buy gun? So all under 21 are irresponsible? NRA dangerous? NOT! Your NYC values showing, once again. Disgusting!!!
2183 2018-03-03 18:35:47 That's true. Automatic weapons have been essentially banned for a long time. But they're not needed for mass murder. A high rate of fire such as an AR-15 can sustain is sufficient even without accessories like bump stocks.
2184 2018-03-03 18:35:40 CFEP should be investigated as well, think they are manipulating share prices on many stocks
2185 2018-03-03 18:35:20 If it was due to a bad mood, why did Deripaska and Icahn dump their steel stocks weeks ago? This seems pretty planned to me.

2190 2018-03-03 18:33:27 @JeffClarktrader  COT net short gold dropped 15,000 contracts this week to 199,796. Does it still need to drop another 50k to start buying gold and gold stocks again?

Watch out for a continuation of the market blood bath next week, as the universe renders its j continuing judgment of "NO CONFIDENCE" in DJT's policies..
2206 2018-03-03 18:26:21 Facts: Construction costs in the USA will rise. USA import sales in the EU will fall. Stocks are plummeting. You are under investigation. People who worked closely with you are being endited. You will make it impossible for our goods to sell there. Big pile of crap!
2207 2018-03-03 18:25:32 @realDonaldTrump  looks like he is short on stocks. Making statements like a fool. You suck man. Have no idea what you are doing. It’s the consumer in the end who pays tax not the companies stupid. All the taxes are passed on whether in USA or EU
2208 2018-03-03 18:22:09 Did you get a piece of Ichans action on dumping steel stocks before you announced tariffs? Pretty sure Mueller will be looking at that
2209 2018-03-03 18:21:34 The only insane rule is the2nd amendment. Let it go. The founding fathers absolutely never envisioned 300 million people, automatic weapons, bump stocks, or 100 people a day dying.
Also the risk of being attacked by indigenous people or mountain lions has passed.
2210 2018-03-03 18:21:12 You are such a F’ing MORON!!  You’re going to singlehandedly send our economy into a tailspin but what do you care, the 1% is unaffected and I’m sure dumped any stocks they had in these car companies recently.
2211 2018-03-03 18:21:04 So you want a pissing contest on tarriffs.  Who suffers is the workers and the people as prices increase. Saw your busy benefited by dumping his steel stocks...may u did too. #Corruption

2214 2018-03-03 18:18:49 Can't say I agree with you there., Ghostwalker gets you back to stage well enough in Jump/Speed Arts, and Shulk has the tools to ledge trap well, so edgeguarding to end stocks isn't a be all/end all for him
2215 2018-03-03 18:18:45 This is a bad look, perhaps. On the other hand, it would be a lot worse if he had BOUGHT millions in steel stocks. Far worse, to me, is Kushner's possible Qatari dealings and his family's 5th Ave property.
2216 2018-03-03 18:18:28 Attempts at building up support level for the current prices of the stocks.. arent the most still overvalued..
2217 2018-03-03 18:18:19 Didn’t Icahn leave the Trump election night party to go trade stocks, made millions? Is there a pattern?
2218 2018-03-03 18:18:00 @SEC_Enforcement @NewYork_SEC Would someone please check phone records between any trump family member and Carl Icahn for the week before trump announced tariffs on steel? And now that Icahn sold his stocks watch for him to buy em back 30 days later then see the tariffs reversed!
2219 2018-03-03 18:17:41 Time to sell your stocks!
2220 2018-03-03 18:16:09 because it would be much better if Hillary had her slimy claws on it,  she could just sell it to Putin after all she sold him 20% of the USA uranium stocks, destabilised Liby for isis who then killed her ambassador, she could leave the fire codes for isis on her illegal server
2221 2018-03-03 18:15:56 The stock exchange keeps plunging since you start your delirium on tariffs: where are your tweets about the stocks record highs, Bozo??? Does not matters anymore, right?
2222 2018-03-03 18:15:45 Curious to see how many of those were so happy with Lord Marmalade’s tax cuts just a short while ago.   Also, how many of the same ones had “miraculously” divested themselves of potentially tariff impacted stocks just before the announcement by 45?
2223 2018-03-03 18:14:01 What he has failed to do is, explain how one of his close friends dumped millions into steel and aluminum stocks days before it came out that, he would do ' Tariff'.
2224 2018-03-03 18:13:23 I just had a thought (few & far between so brace yourself)- if I ran the SEC, I’d be very tempted to look at the investment portfolio of all of those “pundits & advisors” to Lord Marmalade to see how much, if any, they divested of tariff impacted stocks in their invmt portfolios
2225 2018-03-03 18:12:16 Only Trump a corrupt pol & laughably POTUS would have gall to pull that one off. Tank stocks snd short them  Kudos to Icahn and the Trumpster
2226 2018-03-03 18:11:27 No he gave his “Friend” a chance to sell off his steel stocks before he Announced the trade war  I think insider trading???
2227 2018-03-03 18:11:09 Lock her up. Maybe should even be put on public display in stocks....but I am not a Dreamer so her procicution will never happen.
2228 2018-03-03 18:11:00 Stop buying stuff you don’t really need. The short-term endorphin rush isn’t worth putting off your financial freedom from your job.

2229 2018-03-03 18:10:29 How did Karl Icahn no to dump his steel stocks right before you tanked the market?
2230 2018-03-03 18:10:08 That's a good point and if bump stocks get banned that makes a difference as well...I just don't get anybody being against enhanced background checks
2231 2018-03-03 18:09:03 NRA supports gun manufacturers.  Don’t kid yourself.  When gun maker stocks go up, the NRA has done good.  Nothing else matters to them.  They don’t support you.
2232 2018-03-03 18:08:57 No Russian sanctions. Tax break for millionaires and billionaires. Tax break for businesses that didn’t raise wages but bought back their own stocks. A president who insulted Oprah and Alec Baldwin. Nepotism in the WH. They’re laughing at our President.
2233 2018-03-03 18:08:34 Suggest some stocks to buy...
2234 2018-03-03 18:08:29 @JohnKasich of ohio will not take guns he wants to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
2235 2018-03-03 18:08:00 You shorted the stocks for sure...
2236 2018-03-03 18:07:54 Along with the Porter investigation, @TGowdySC please investigate @Carl_C_Icahn sale of steel days before @realDonaldTrump announced steel tariffs that plummeted steel stocks.
2237 2018-03-03 18:07:26 Is it illegal  to use insider information to dump millions in steel stocks before Trump’s tariff announcement?
2238 2018-03-03 18:07:14 Who has deposit savings that match the stocks and bonds in their pensions? Or deposit savings that match their house price gains. You have an anachronistic view of pensioners that bears no relation to real life. #pensions

2240 2018-03-03 18:05:51 I heard about this dumping of steel related stocks this morning. Former advisor of trump’s. Imagine that.
2241 2018-03-03 18:05:05 You mean you and your cohorts wealth! We the people see nothing & struggle at a living wage, while big business buys their stocks back. No new jobs?! Loser!

"Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser [Carl Icahn] dumped millions in steel-related stocks" 
via @WashingtonPost
2243 2018-03-03 18:03:56 Let’s try
1. People unable to get security clearances 
2. Foreign policy contingent on loans for Kushner
3. Not implementing Russian sanctions 
4. Icahn selling MILLIONS in stocks days before a trade policy change
5. Wife beater in the Oval
Shall we continue? It’s been constant

2245 2018-03-03 18:02:12 500 million. He went to Jared.... Icahn 30 million steel stocks before tariff announcement.....
2246 2018-03-03 18:01:29 I bet Levin is mad about the tariffs because his man Trump did not give him a heads up so he could make a fortune dumping his stocks.

@mafiadaytrading Last 3 chapters definitely my favorite, will watch it again this weekend. Can't wait for mentorship webinar today!
2248 2018-03-03 18:01:03 But if Carl Icahn dumped a bunch of stocks days earlier, then either Icahn is a genius (could be) or Trump knew what he was going to say days earlier or Icahn coached him for reasons unknown. Are there other options?
2249 2018-03-03 18:00:57 Thanks for sharing man!   I really like the look of that CCRC chart you posted earlier.   Great looking pinball setup.   If China stocks can catch fire this one could have a nice surge.  Have a great weekend.

-Ban Bump Stocks, Ban all "Automatic Firearms"
-A process to OWN those Banned arms with proper oversight, recording, & monitoring.
2252 2018-03-03 17:59:03 If you mean a govt entity that props up market by buying stocks, I doubt it.  Or 2008 crash would not have happened.  Rallies occur in bear markets due to shorts taking profits (and brave bulls buying in).
2253 2018-03-03 17:58:56 I’m telling you that he’s shorted a whole bunch of stocks.
2254 2018-03-03 17:58:53 This just in! The recent new Tax Cuts statistics show large Corporations reinvesting in their Stocks that they can now budget in versus giving out raises to All. Now People thats telling where their proorities are at. Like this Candidate that is supportive of big corporations
2255 2018-03-03 17:58:42 I think the steel stocks will be a great buy soon
2256 2018-03-03 17:58:35 OH BOY!!!! Looks like I need to sell some stocks before they tank because of what you just said.
2257 2018-03-03 17:58:29 Sure, it won't be his kids fighting, and he probably owns plenty of defense stocks. #LindseyGraham
2258 2018-03-03 17:58:28 In Canada rifles are pretty much all bolt action, no more than 3+1 bullets and NO semi automatics, bump stocks or pistol grips. Works for moose and bear, can’t see why anyone would need more.
Shotguns can be semi automatic, but again no clips. 3 rounds only.
Pistols - range only.

2262 2018-03-03 17:56:48 By the way, how is the simple EO banning bump stocks coming along?  The one that was “done” on Wednesday?
2263 2018-03-03 17:56:01 J'ai dû mal m'exprimer:
Les vrais riches ne sont pas ceux qui ont des stocks options ou des actions gratuites, les vrais riches sont ceux qui possèdent la totalité ou une part importante des actions des grandes sociétés, qu'ils ont soit créées, soit héritées, soit développées.
2264 2018-03-03 17:55:42 It's lucky that you told your cabinet & staff that you were going to announce this so they could sell their stocks in metals. I wish you would have told me also, now I have lost a lot of money..thank you!!!!
2265 2018-03-03 17:55:41 WAPO: "Shortly before tRump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks". Sounds like insider trading to me. Will WH staff visit you in prison? Asking for a friend.
2266 2018-03-03 17:55:28 As a Brit, I concur. Shame that both the US and the UK have been turned into such laughing stocks by such complete morons.
2267 2018-03-03 17:55:24 All I can say is at present, I am more ursine than bovine but not opposed to writing some puts on good stocks with expiration dates farther into the future.
2268 2018-03-03 17:54:58 I believe that the current laws on book - which ban full auto guns are fair.  I disagree with Obama’s ruling that bump stocks should be legal - I agree w/NRA that they should be illegal
2269 2018-03-03 17:54:57 The Obama administration determined that it was not regulated under federal law. That is following the law, not endorsing bump stocks. The right wing have become nothing but propagandists.
2270 2018-03-03 17:54:16 Plus the fact that Icahn dumped steel stocks just before.
2271 2018-03-03 17:53:09 However, I'm not sure what banning bump stocks will accomplish in terms of real mass shooter or terrorist prevention since I'm aware of only one attack (the Vegas Concert Attack) that employed a firearm with a bumpstock. This is just a typical adhoc DO SOMETHING reaction. 2/2
2272 2018-03-03 17:52:59 It's a wonder his rich buddies don't turn on him.  I am pretty sure they are invested in stocks.
2273 2018-03-03 17:52:53 Badger baiting, bear baiting, public executions, the stocks. I’ll stop there, or it’ll have Brexiters all flushed in the cheeks.

2275 2018-03-03 17:51:53 @realDonaldTrump look what you've done to your children you made them all laughing stocks and you made most of America hate them, laugh at them, ridicule them mostly disrespect them. You should resign and let them save face. #hatetrumps
2276 2018-03-03 17:51:37 When a friend of the President sells 31 million in stocks just before announcing a tariff, alarm bells need to go. If Preet Bharara was the US Attorney he would have investigated
2277 2018-03-03 17:51:14 I mean I didn't follow stocks and trends and the ebb and flow of general investing in ForEx or any other market for that matter, stocks, precious metals, commodities, bonds... none of it.
2278 2018-03-03 17:50:26 I think @realdonaldtrump knew these tariffs would send the stock market into a freefall, so he and all his pals could buy up loads of stocks at rock bottom prices, then he announces he’s rolling back the tariffs and they all make a windfall. This needs to be investigated.
2279 2018-03-03 17:50:23 Is that a Lancashire thing?! 
Hope you have replenished your stocks and have a good night 
2280 2018-03-03 17:49:11 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!

2281 2018-03-03 17:48:46 Many people move/sell/buy stocks at the beginning of the year after they see the tax planner. You people can't get away from blaming Trump for everything can you? Wake the he** up!
2282 2018-03-03 17:48:43 Ok Fair enough, I can respect that you feel you should be allowed weapons, but that it should be a lot harder to get them. I guess the issue is everyone lumps in any restrictions with the notion of a complete ban and they freak out. 

Bump stocks do seem extremely unnecessary.
2283 2018-03-03 17:48:36 Jackie recorded   teh cocky stocks . >:( 
2284 2018-03-03 17:48:23 You gave your buddy a deal so he could dump his steel stocks a few weeks before your perceived tantrum on tariffs, whilst your thug family and cabinet seeks to enrich themselves by literally robbing this Nation. I for one hope there is a perp walk with you in cuffs.
2285 2018-03-03 17:48:19 We just tripled the import tariffs on those and stocks plummeted.

It's always a deal. He wants smthing from someone, he changes policy. Just like Kushner=WH job for BIG loan.
2289 2018-03-03 17:47:00 Banning military type weapons, bump stocks. And tighter registration should be on you list along with the rest of what you say. By your list 1 life lost is jut as important as any other.

2302 2018-03-03 17:40:55 My point is he didn’t ban them after his 8 years in office for somebody who is anti gun. I am against bump stocks.
2303 2018-03-03 17:40:04 True investors or dilettantes?  Very important difference as one recognizes opportunities with good stocks in a bad market and behaves according.  Things do not exist in a vacuum and have to contend with decisions of the Fed and governments.
2304 2018-03-03 17:39:41 And insider trading on steel stocks.

2314 2018-03-03 17:35:31 Well there ya go. Problem solved. Stupid propaganda. If you want to stop this kind of stuff deal with the actual problem. Bump stocks are not the problem. ABC news is part of the problem when they report crap like this.
2315 2018-03-03 17:34:38 But I find it hard to believe his friend just happened to get rid of his steel stocks....at this very time.
2316 2018-03-03 17:34:36 he is banning bump stocks and making the age 21. 2 things obama, busch & clinton could have done but didnt
2317 2018-03-03 17:34:31 And then there's that bit about his buddy Icahn making a fortune unloading steel stocks a few days before....
2318 2018-03-03 17:33:50 Every thing trump does relates to crooked manipulations of one thing or another ! This time his tariffs are for manipulating the stocks in steel and aluminum !
2319 2018-03-03 17:33:37 The US equity market consist of around 110 sectors, that I review weekly. Subsequently I go through all stocks within the preferred sectors (usually 5-10 sectors) and finally I bring my candidate list down to 10-30 stocks. It takes time, but it pays off and I like it   :-)
2320 2018-03-03 17:33:23 So that talks about assesing the legality of bump stocks, i do recall numerous times after shootings that Obama came forward with gun control initiatives though ? 
Are you saying you don't want these bump stocks ? What is your personal view ?
2321 2018-03-03 17:32:52 Not if your trumps adviser - he dumped $31.3 million in steel stocks before trump became unhinged
2322 2018-03-03 17:31:44 yep... that's when Canadian stocks were sold to Russia.

And idiots thought we dug up 20 of our uranium ore and took it to Russia in a lead lined suitcase.

2333 2018-03-03 17:27:02 Perhaps people should be buying manufacturing equipment instead of stocks.  This is an issue of national security.  We can't depend on communist China for steel and aluminum.  Besides, theirs is substandard anyway.

2337 2018-03-03 17:24:41 @RepSwalwell Will there be an investigation to Carl Icahn unloading his steel related stocks?

2340 2018-03-03 17:22:44 And given the fact that Icahn sold off all of his steel stocks before the tariffs were announced, we know that they were planned in advance. It's being spun that he declared them in the midst of a tantrum, but that's just a work for his latest scheme.
2341 2018-03-03 17:22:42 Their stocks game has in app purchases?

2345 2018-03-03 17:19:36 Invest in commodities, Soon as We stop food stamps and give a commodity boxes... Stocks May go up!
2346 2018-03-03 17:18:06 @FBI @AGSchneiderman
Is the Security Exchange Commission doing something regarding Carl Ichan selling his "Steel stocks" a week before Trump announced tariffs?
2347 2018-03-03 17:18:04 For anyone who has said "Trumps tweets don't matter" he just started a trade war that made my stocks plunge.  Yes they matter.
2348 2018-03-03 17:17:26 I doubt Clayton will do anything about Icahn's dumped stocks, either. I'm sure Mueller is paying attention, though.
2349 2018-03-03 17:17:24 Unfortunately, all we can ever expect from our legislatures is political expediency. Banning bump stocks, which were used in one mass murder, and raising the age to 21 will have zero impact on America's propensity for gun violence, but Congress will get to say, we did something.
2350 2018-03-03 17:16:41 My stocks looking really good right now 
2351 2018-03-03 17:15:48 Is the Security Exchange Commission doing something regarding Carl Ichan selling his "Steel stocks" a week before Trump announced tariffs?
2352 2018-03-03 17:15:14 @AliVelshi @SRuhle @maddow 
How many people trade stocks ahead of Trump 'outbursts'? Trading in metals and steel before the tariff outburst.....How about Russians. Think. #alternativefacts #TheBeat #SOTU
2353 2018-03-03 17:14:23 Switching names wasnt the entire problem; webcams were lined up A-B but the character stocks were B-A. We lined up names w/ the cams cuz dabuz had a tag on so the characters should be EZ to track. We also updated (reversed) our stage Thursday so sitting reversed was understndable
2354 2018-03-03 17:13:07 Jeez, do you love semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks that bad? Chill the f**k out, it's Saturday.
2355 2018-03-03 17:11:51 @EdenRiversTrust stopping idiots driving through the river at jubilee at Appleby during spawning time may help your salmon stocks
2356 2018-03-03 17:10:54 Crazy to realize how much Im paying in commission fees trading OTC stocks in @IBKR
2357 2018-03-03 17:10:51 He must be both a mind reader and a contrarian.  Even Trump didn’t know what he was going to do a week ago. Also, one would normally expect higher import tariffs to support US steel stocks.
2358 2018-03-03 17:09:26 Good thing your friend  sold his steel stocks. I'd hate to see him lose too.
2359 2018-03-03 17:08:45 Can we sue trump for tanking stocks the way he’s tweeted we should when others comments have done the same?
2360 2018-03-03 17:07:37 2.5 million jobs...what the fuck are you smoking? With every turn, Trump invokes yet another tariff that puts US workers out of jobs, all for the benifit of his cronies that own domestic steel stocks...again I ask, what the fuck are you smoking...
2361 2018-03-03 17:07:16 ikaw nga sa manila pa hindi makahanap, what more dito sa probinsya? Haha! Papa-reserve na lang siguro ako at baka may dadating na stocks. Sana meron. 
2362 2018-03-03 17:07:14 Wish I had more information on how stocks worked whenever I graduated high school
2363 2018-03-03 17:05:40 A few stocks removed from the weekly ACJ watchlist: $ALRM $MU $ROKU $CORT $FCAU and a few added: $AAPL $SIVB $TRU $YY $STZ
2364 2018-03-03 17:05:26 Well This is probably just coincidental. I’m sure he had a meeting or something like that with Lil Donnie Jr at Trump Tower . An they talked about adoptions or something similar to that . An they decided that they should sell of their steel stocks . 
2365 2018-03-03 17:04:48 You don’t need to invest in many crypto/stocks to get rich. Just go all in in 1 or 2 cryptos/stocks that you research thoroughly and wait for the right price to sell
2366 2018-03-03 17:04:45 Crazy ROE & ROA stocks 
2367 2018-03-03 17:04:42 Hit 'em in the pocketbook. DIVEST of any stocks or mutual fund you might have invested in guns or the arms industry. Black Rock is encouraging this option.
2368 2018-03-03 17:04:18 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
2369 2018-03-03 17:03:56 I have uranium one has been debunked even by fox news. On top of that the bump stocks were not approved by Obama but he couldn't ban them as the law was. When brought to a republican Congress the amendment to the law was blocked.
2370 2018-03-03 17:03:53 Looking at how inaccurate major business/finance have been at reporting crypto at times (Korea & China FUD etc..) I'd say that can we trust that they check their facts for the standard financial news like geopolitics, stocks, macro?
2371 2018-03-03 17:03:22 Stocks need topped up, ptfe tape ballcock weshers n a 1/2" f/f elbow 
We must take water pipes n troughs fr granted , the work it saves..... nice nu everything can drink without the pushing n shoving for first dibbs....
2372 2018-03-03 17:02:56 @TeamCavuto Banning 'BUMB STOCKS' WILL SOLVE NOTHING!
A knowled. gun person can 'fabricate' a bump stock; plus they are available BLACK MARKET, ETC. We have no idea how to stop the CARNAGE. IDEA! 'HOLD THE PURCH.GUN 60 DAYS FOR EXT. BCK GRD CHECKS- & PUT ARMED GUARDS AT SCHOOLS?
2373 2018-03-03 17:02:22 Wait what are you saying? Trump told his own party that they’re all scared of the NRA and we should have more background checks, raise age limit to get a gun, and ban bump stocks. After his meeting with the NRA he changed his stances.
2374 2018-03-03 17:02:08 The folks on that video keep saying "God forbid," when people have the power to and responsibility to forbid -- forbid teenage gun licenses, forbid bump stocks, etc.
This is not something that requires divine intervention to prevent.
And God (no God) is not on their side in this.
2375 2018-03-03 17:01:48 Stop acting like this is news. Watch who starts buying aluminum and steel stocks before @realDonaldTrump walks his tariff threat back. He's using his words to manipulate the stock market and making ppl richer who will "thank him" when he's out of office. How is this not obvious?
2376 2018-03-03 17:01:44 Listen to what the fisherman said. Stocks are plentyful. They are being given to other EU members fishing fleets. Do you not understand that if you divide your stock between multiple parties you get less. It's kindergarten math.
2377 2018-03-03 17:01:40 Stand with Floridians against the NRA. BAN Assault weapons, large capacity magazines, armor piercing bullets, bump stocks, and universal background checks for all weapons and ammunition sales. First Amendment rights before 2nd Amendment. 
Life. Liberty. Pursuit of Happiness.
2378 2018-03-03 17:00:57 Are you going to ban "bump stocks" or "rifle furniture"? Do you ban any "device" that allows a rifle to fire in rapid succession, such as a bump stock? I think that this is where the problem lies...it is the language, Mike
2379 2018-03-03 17:00:28 Damn I’m still holding my steel stocks. This sux!
2380 2018-03-03 17:00:27 Step two, he begins buying up steel related stocks at low prices shortly before Trump withdraws/abandons his tariffs.
2381 2018-03-03 17:00:19 I don't disagree with your premise, but I was surprised to hear at one point that she was jailed for lying not the actual dumping of the stocks.
2382 2018-03-03 16:57:32 Oh! Your work around TraderVue is genius! Will help many trading #ASX stocks. Thanks
2383 2018-03-03 16:57:25 Marco’s (NRA dictated) plan will do absolutely nothing to stop mass killings.  Try instead: 1) ban assault weapons; 2) outlaw bump stocks; 3) limit magazines to 5 rounds; 4) end “gun shows;” 5) strengthen background checks.   Wake the hell up.
2384 2018-03-03 16:56:16 Yep, hope you are not the one killed with an assault weapon. Gun manufacturers laugh at the NRA idiots who run out and stockpile. Remember how much ammo was 2 yrs ago? Gun stocks go up when scared people panic. Feed your family with the money instead.
2385 2018-03-03 16:55:55 At the end of the season Les,Ralph & MP deserved to be put in stocks outside the bargate and have rotten fruit lobbed at them,absolute morons the lot of them #saintsfc

2387 2018-03-03 16:53:35 @JoyAnnReid  The stocks he dumped were not steit was a crane manufacturer
2388 2018-03-03 16:53:20 I think it's fair to say that after days of desperate punters pleading with her for milk as she has trudged through the snow to serve diminished milk stocks (probably on little more than minimum wage) we should give her torn face the benefit of the doubt.
2389 2018-03-03 16:52:45 Stocks of American steel companies rose after the announcement. So do your reporters have brains and do actual research, or just vomit out their stories without thinking?
2390 2018-03-03 16:52:43 Targeted tariffs creates winners and losers. If you let your buddies know what you are going to do they will all be big winners and make billions in dumping stocks and they will no doubt lavish something down the line on their benefactor. Why is this ok?
2391 2018-03-03 16:52:12 @cavuto The amount of ignorance regarding guns is ASTOUNDING! All day long you hear 'BAN BUMP STOCKS' - such a prolific statement!
FOR THE RECORD, ANY KNOWLEDGEABLE GUN PER. CAN 'FABRICATE A BUMP STOCK'; PLUS THE ARE AVAIL ON BLACK MARKET! BANNING WILL SOLVE 'NOTHING'!
2392 2018-03-03 16:51:51 That doesn't change the fact that an ex-adviser who Trump has been known to still talk to dumped a million stocks in steel two weeks before this announcement. The stocks of the company that were dumped dropped $6 after the announcement. How is that not insider trading?
2393 2018-03-03 16:51:40 Bot, you must use specifics.  I want a ban on any assault type weapon; that includes bump stocks and AR15.  I want pre-ownership educational classes (just like required before you can drive a car).  I want full DOJ/FBI Live Scan fingerprinting background checks.
2394 2018-03-03 16:50:55 So many people out on expeditions today.... wait. No. They’re just going through the supermarket to see if the hummus stocks have been replenished...
2395 2018-03-03 16:50:47 Кому должны-мы тем прощаем!)
2396 2018-03-03 16:50:32 Newsweek: "Former tRump adviser dumped millions 8n steel stocks days before the *president announced new tariffs". I'm sure it was just a co-inky dink that he dumped his stocks when he did.
2397 2018-03-03 16:50:05 And if you tip off Carl Icahn about the upcoming imposition of tariffs and he sells off $31+ million in steel heavy stocks then you've just committed yet another crime.
2398 2018-03-03 16:50:04 I'm no expert, but this strikes me as the very definition of insider trading.

Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks

2401 2018-03-03 16:49:12 How did Carl Icahn know to trade his steel stocks one week prior? Maybe this was planned
2402 2018-03-03 16:47:35 Their stocks begin to plummet as I remain skinny 
2403 2018-03-03 16:47:29 I’m so tired I can’t function and it will only continue as I proceed to pound stocks, bonds, and installment notes into my head for this fucking midterm
2404 2018-03-03 16:47:10 A stock or some stocks...it is the corporations era...
2405 2018-03-03 16:47:09 How is this protecting? Your billionaire friends don’t believe it. They sold their stocks right before you went public.
Cleaning the Swamp?? More force feeding it!
2406 2018-03-03 16:46:46 I told my 3yo I was taking her to a store that stocks my products. When I said I had to look up the directions, she was appalled: "If it's your product, you should know how to get to your product."
2407 2018-03-03 16:46:20 How many have been implemented? Don said, don't be concerned with bump stocks, they're gone, I can take care of that! Well, still waiting.
2408 2018-03-03 16:46:11 ... just be careful these technical analysts do not scare you out of what may be a once in a lifetime long position with one of their magic gold dust 'sell' signals. The charts may work sometimes with (some) stocks ... they will not work with #bitcoin $BTC
2409 2018-03-03 16:44:58 do you pay attention to anything? He is trying to ban bump stocks and get mental health checks required.
2410 2018-03-03 16:44:57 I need to get back to japan soon. Looking at you, money in stocks 
2411 2018-03-03 16:44:24 Ross, what I meant is that we will (probably) see P/E compression for some growth stocks. I thought it was what you meant :)
2412 2018-03-03 16:43:39 The problem for most ppl right now is not that - quality stocks are available at a discount. It's the doubt whether there'll be a bigger sale in the coming weeks @WeekendInvestng
2413 2018-03-03 16:43:37 So many people I talk are so fed up w libs fake crusade against NRA that they r actually joining and purchasing ar15s! How dumb can libs be? Either that or they must own stocks in gun manufacturers.....
2414 2018-03-03 16:43:34 Whats the most fee-friendly brokerage to trade OTC stocks? @BullishFlex @Three2001 ?
2415 2018-03-03 16:42:23 @larry_kudlow I honestly believe it’s not the tariff that’s causing the correction in the stock market. I believe it’s the Fed raising interest rates. The banks have to give up their free money, which means they got to sell their stocks they accumulated on margin
2416 2018-03-03 16:40:51 I do agree with outlawing b stocks, changing the age to 21 with military exceptions and stronger back ground checks
2417 2018-03-03 16:40:27 Carl Icahn is definitely one person who profited by your new steel policy. I wonder who fed him insider info so he could sell his $31 million in stocks before they tumbled?
2418 2018-03-03 16:39:13 Just remember... CarlIcahn knew about the tariffs days before they happened because he had time to dump his stocks.

So 45 didn’t do it on a whim or in a fit of temper, it was planned well in advance and everyone was warned (everyone 45 cared to tell).

And MarthaStewart...

2423 2018-03-03 16:37:32 This is milk toast. What happened to bump stocks and magazine clips? FYI: I’m a Florida independent voter.
2424 2018-03-03 16:37:27 Any suggestions for trading w/ 401k , instead of being in some dummy proof account, where it takes days to liquidate a position. As it concerns bonds or stocks, got out when the broad market was overbought, waited full day into the correction before my transaction processed.
2425 2018-03-03 16:37:18 They can be viewed as cheap call options. I would visit and buy many, many (penny stocks now)
2426 2018-03-03 16:36:53 Tbh for the turin, I feel that it’s a rare opportunity esp since you won’t be paying for the shipping it’s just a matter of stocks but Idt it’ll be sold out yet
2427 2018-03-03 16:36:14 My stocks dropped.  His poor choices, his lack of impulse control is costing me money.  A real American - wants to support the middle class, uplift the poor and raise the standard of living.  His policies are destroying us!

2430 2018-03-03 16:35:28 @amjoyshow  Legislators in all states & congress need to see crime scene photos from Sandy Hook and MSD. Maybe that will change their minds to ban auto/assault/military weapons, bomp stocks and ammun.

2433 2018-03-03 16:35:14 Your ignorance and disdain for your constituents is extremely infuriating. Your lack of empathy was expressed quite well. To place blame on entertainment for the mass shootings makes you sound moronic at best. Your opinion that bump stocks have no effect on mass murder, is wrong!
2434 2018-03-03 16:35:13 Ask any red-blooded, gun-loving American...you’ll get plenty of complaints. Even something as innocuous as talk of banning bump-stocks on ARs becomes a political battle.
2435 2018-03-03 16:33:28 J'ai en tête une "rumeur" comme quoi les stocks de livres envoyés spécialement pour les festivals et dédicaces sont comptés comme de la promotion/pub par les éditeurs, donc non-soumis au calcul des droits d'auteurs.
Mais vraiment très vague, et je ne suis pas dans l'édition
2436 2018-03-03 16:33:22 @LindsayGrahamSC says a war with N Korea is "a good idea."

2437 2018-03-03 16:32:59 So I went out to buy stocks in a nearby 24hr supermarket. Nakasalubong ko along the street yung dati kong kapitbahay. Still the same, iba talaga titigan namen 
Yung parang gusto ka halikan. 
2438 2018-03-03 16:32:57 And...your boy Carl Ichan sells millions in steel stocks right before you announce tariffs. Nothing to see here right?
2439 2018-03-03 16:32:26 He is just grifting. He has a 135k pension. Horses he doesn't know how to ride. Large properties with land. Rich buddies. And probably many stocks and other liquid assets.

He is fine and has ZERO clue about being "broke."

2443 2018-03-03 16:29:43 Dbongino we care about sensible gun laws for law abiding people.  With a few sensible changes like banning assault weapons, universal back ground checks, banning bump stocks the law abiding citizens in poll after poll say they want these changes NRA=Republicans =blood money
2444 2018-03-03 16:29:13 ... So by now, are they giving you stocks in the company, depending on how many lego sets you buy?!

2447 2018-03-03 16:26:22 LMFAOOO Thank u so much love u!! Hoping for some good stocks as gifts today
2448 2018-03-03 16:26:02 Educate yourself beyond FOX. The uranium myth has been rebutted, explained, and reviewed hundreds of times. The bump stocks were not an approval. It was a determination that current law could not forbid it. GOP congress refused to amend the law.
2449 2018-03-03 16:25:54 Actually the NRA did come out against bump stocks. And they did have weapons that fired more then 1 shot.
2450 2018-03-03 16:24:09 Imagine having the longest pro sports championship drought and being a worse option than the Jets. That's called laughing stocks.
2451 2018-03-03 16:23:49 Hunting rifles are not in question- assault weapons that are used by army (and bump stocks that make mass shootings easier) are the ones that are dangerous 
Even guns needed for self defense needn’t be the kinds used for Florida
Why do we regulate grenades and torpedos?
2452 2018-03-03 16:23:22 #WeThePeople DEMAND Responsible Gun Ownership and Gunmanship Legislation that becomes common sense Law. Bump stocks & silencers should be illegal. No kid should be able to get ARs. The mentally ill should not have guns. Background checks mandatory. Interagency felony reporting.
2453 2018-03-03 16:23:20 Bump stocks should have been made illegal the week after Vegas. Everyone failed. They turn a good working gun into a half ass weapon that doesn't work properly.  Even Trump said we should look to ban them.

2456 2018-03-03 16:21:44 Oh, YES! TOTALLY agree with you on that!
They don't use BUMP STOCKS for deer hunting!
2457 2018-03-03 16:21:20 Then why didn’t he buy steel stocks?
2458 2018-03-03 16:21:04 Ask Martha Stewart how well selling stocks ahead worked for her!
2459 2018-03-03 16:20:56 Quite sure if if wasn't for quotas there wouldn't be any fishing stocks left
2460 2018-03-03 16:20:55 It's to my understanding that fully automatic weapons are already banned in the US & Trump is saying he'll ban the bump stocks that enable a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster through an executive order. But to answer your question yes & semi-automatics as well
2461 2018-03-03 16:20:38 True to our roots, L.L.Bean has sold firearms specifically for hunting & only in our ME store after comprehensive background checks in compliance w/ State/Fed law. We do not sell assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, bump stocks or handguns. ^lb

2464 2018-03-03 16:15:56 But by Trump's mentality, shouldn't those stocks GO UP? lol
2465 2018-03-03 16:15:50 My mood is now entirely dependent on my stocks so plan accordingly
2466 2018-03-03 16:14:36 Can that include charges of insider trading now that it appears Trump told his buddies his plans so that they could dump their stocks before his big announcement.
2467 2018-03-03 16:14:13 Gold is outperforming stocks ytd.  3% position is great insurance. Talk to Kyle Bass before you do anything Texas.
2468 2018-03-03 16:13:49 We need to re-instate the assault weapons ban, so no weapon of war is on our streets, come up with sensible background checks so folks that are unstable or mentally ill can’t get their hands on a weapon and eliminate bump stocks. That’s a good start. #AssaultWeaponsBan

2471 2018-03-03 16:12:06 Hi @AsdaServiceTeam could you tell me if there are stocks of almond Baileys and free from hot cross buns at your Gorseinon store, if not the closest after there, many thanks

Why Brexit Negotiations Could Drive the Britis…
2473 2018-03-03 16:11:02 @CJStocks9 If you're going to concede 7, you need to score 8!
2474 2018-03-03 16:10:52 It will happen again unless you help us ban bump stocks and assault rifles. NEVER AGAIN
2475 2018-03-03 16:10:36 And got more done then any other president, where do business men make deals?  The golf course.
2476 2018-03-03 16:10:05 “In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.” So true from WEB. We have been on a stupendous bull run since ‘08. Pullbacks are inevitable. Returns in general will be lower. But not negative over the long-term. Stocks are still better than almost any other asset.
2477 2018-03-03 16:09:30 What about banning bump stocks? They allowed mass slaughter in Las Vegas. Do you lack the spine to call for a ban on them?
2478 2018-03-03 16:09:26 Admit it, you’ve been a Russian pawn since your intern turned up dead in your office
2479 2018-03-03 16:09:09 Also, in a panic, stocks that are cheap can get even cheaper, so you have to scale in too.
2480 2018-03-03 16:08:56 GRAPHITE STOCKS WERE D STOCKS OUTPERFORMED D MARKET W/O DOUBT SOME EXPERTS SAID "GET OUT" -GRAPHITE STOCKS-OVER VALUED IN MORNING CALL @CNBCTV18Live . BUT I DID REVERSE CONTINUED INVESTED FOR MORE THAN 18 MNTHS. GAVE 1000% RTRN. ATLEAST 2QTR MORE THESE STOCKS WILL PERFORM SURE!!
2481 2018-03-03 16:08:55 @DaveRamsey could you explain the difference between value and growth stocks? It seems like all of the high performing “Growth Stock Mutual Funds” have a blend of growth and value stocks.
2482 2018-03-03 16:08:35 I don’t know I see my simple can of Pepsi going up because of the aluminum ? Due to That great tariff act! That stopped and dropped the stocks as well!! Bet trump is say oh crap now!
2483 2018-03-03 16:07:49 Stocks has been unbelievable as well I'll give you that!
2484 2018-03-03 16:07:37 I tried to get some last night but they were out!!
2485 2018-03-03 16:07:24 I agree that there are irrational momentum effects. The solution is never to be entirely out of stocks, merely to scale down exposure as valuations begin to look irrational.
2486 2018-03-03 16:07:12 #CarlIcahn sells off $31M in #steel related stocks days prior to Trump's announcements. Oh that's sneaky.
,,,=^;;^=,,,
2487 2018-03-03 16:06:59 checkout @MrContrarian tweet just now covering all 48 Beaufort stocks. 80% decline
2488 2018-03-03 16:06:50 a co třeba kdyby CNB rekla, až se uzavre inflation gap to by taky nezpůsobilo příliv kapitálu a všichni by věděli kdy to bude.
2489 2018-03-03 16:06:47 Watch closely in a week or 2 Trump will reverse his decision based on world reaction just before his buddies buy back a whole bunch of stocks.That is an indictable offense.
2490 2018-03-03 16:06:13 bump stocks aren’t in the constitution asshat
2491 2018-03-03 16:05:10 "Kept the lights on"? By going on strike for a year? It was Thatcher's government that stockpiled coal stocks and protected the miners who wanted to work.
2492 2018-03-03 16:04:54 And farming isn’t the cause of Comm fishing decline say on the north coast is it?? There aren’t any farms there yet stocks decline
2493 2018-03-03 16:04:38 People getting excited because THEY have big money in stocks. It’s THEIR own group playing in and out with the stocks. 

PANIC is ‘happy time’ for those on the LEFT

Things get a bit worse before they get better.  Wasn’t it expected in reversing the SWAMP decisions of the past?
2494 2018-03-03 16:01:57 America: We want gun control           Government: We could raise the age, maybe ban bump stocks.     America: We want gun control.     Government: Sorry, the NRA said no. 
2495 2018-03-03 16:01:37 Credit score moving like Netflix stocks
2496 2018-03-03 16:01:21 Which is the best timeframe to analyse the stocks based on #Ztrends as per your observation?
2497 2018-03-03 16:01:20 In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett said the inability to time such declines (steep drops in share prices) is the strongest argument against using borrowed money to buy stocks.

2498 2018-03-03 16:00:03 On Nov 16, @VincentDeluard started DUMB, a fictional #ETF that invests in the #stocks not included in popular smart beta #ETFs. 16 months later, DUMB beats SMART by 180 basis points. Find out why the Year of the Dog could be another year of DUMB.
2499 2018-03-03 15:59:46 Sears & JC Penny have the most clearance sales and markdowns and both of these companies stocks have fallen over the past two years to almost $2. JCP $85 and Sears was over $195 at one time. We sel a lot of stuff at our yard sales from these stores. Thx JCP & Sears!!!
2500 2018-03-03 15:57:45 Look for stocks which are trending and avoid whipsawing stocks.  Whipsawing can be used to trade options.

For positional, Use hourly and 2 Hourly for entry and daily Timeframe for confirmation and high level trend.
2501 2018-03-03 15:57:16 I'd also add: when capital operates through financial markets (stocks and debt), money makes money without adding any value in itself. So, those with money get money for nothing.  We thus need to make financial markets work for investment independently of this process.
2502 2018-03-03 15:55:57 As a kid fishing was one way I grew up learning & loving wildlife & the environment. You should work with bodies to make waterways cleaner, wildlife-rich with healthy fish stocks. Your campaigns are an affront and real anglers should have no truck with this rubbish.
2503 2018-03-03 15:54:34 Stocks are up, unemployment is down...yep...bad at everything. Amazing how you people believe everything on the internet. SMH
2504 2018-03-03 15:53:59 My daddy is always looking at stock charts. He says JC Penny and Sears are looking like they are going out of biz. Both stocks have gone almost to $2 per share
2505 2018-03-03 15:53:16 Sure let's have that conversation, Roland. The same Bible was used in early America to hang people, burn people (Mary Queen of Scots in England), put people in stocks and whip people (white people by the way). But it's not in the New Testament. A lot of us know this.
2506 2018-03-03 15:53:14 No. Acorns is a "roboinvestor" that rounds up your purchases and invests those funds into predetermined funds/indexes. 

Robinhood is a trading platform where you deposit money and choose which stocks to purchase.
2507 2018-03-03 15:53:06 Nice work Sam!!! I say we do this weekly or even daily for the highest bashed stocks. Those scumbags usually target a few tickers and flock in like vultures.
2508 2018-03-03 15:52:27 Obviously someone that has never watched you before or taken your advice on stocks and made money......like many of us!  Haha - knucklehead
2509 2018-03-03 15:52:27 Not making any sense. What a bad move! Should have waited until after the decision to raise tariffs...stocks went up then.
2510 2018-03-03 15:50:41 trump is furious at Wall Street for not supporting him in his trade war. Why, all those people selling off their stocks were doing it to insult him.
2511 2018-03-03 15:50:00 Wow - what an awesome start !! I think big returns can be made with a small number of Stocks but it's high risk so the downside is bad years likely to be really bad. Too stressful for me !!
2512 2018-03-03 15:49:24 @realDonaldTrump Hey tiny hands, poser brave bully man, it’s been 72 hours since you promised executive order on bump stocks, why??????
2513 2018-03-03 15:48:12 Anybody know what stocks the family is invested in?  I'm sure he sold his stock in steel and aluminum before the tariffs and I'm sure he bought them back after they fell.
2514 2018-03-03 15:48:10 I have no problem with banning bump stocks and stricter background checks, but I have to draw the line at raising the minimum age to 21. That only punishes the law abiding citizen between the ages of 18-20 who want to buy a hunting rifle.
2515 2018-03-03 15:48:09 And insider trading in steel related stocks for Trump's friends. #Impeach45Pence #Kleptocracy #MarchForOurLives #TrumpDevolution
2516 2018-03-03 15:47:43 Does anyone else find it curious that Carl Icahn invested $31 million into steel stocks BEFORE Trump announced the tariffs? I like Trump, but this STINKS
2517 2018-03-03 15:46:35 Valuations mean nothing outside of context. The value of a bond with a 5% yield is wildly different if inflation is at 1% or 6%. The same is true of the earnings yield on stocks. The PE in itself is close to meaningless.
2518 2018-03-03 15:46:13 #CarlIchan<--best bud of #POTUS dumps #steel #stocks hours/a day (?!) before #TrumpTariffs and the DowJones plummets 500 pts. #Collusion #SEC violation
2519 2018-03-03 15:45:33 L.L.Bean only sells firearms specifically for hunting and only in our ME store after comprehensive background checks in compliance w. State/Fed law. We do not sell assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, bump stocks or handguns of any kind. ^tf
2520 2018-03-03 15:45:05 Did they you were there and you know what was said? He is still for changing the age 21, better background checks, banning bump stocks, so what has changed? Getting rid of the NRA is going to Markle all schools safe?
2521 2018-03-03 15:43:49 Fox for stocks? Its an Easter egg hunt among the political weeds. CNBC needs to keep control but does a pretty fair and balanced job. @GuyAdami  you and the Fast Money traders rock! It's my daily meeting!
2522 2018-03-03 15:43:13 Would suggest you can comfortably add #LION to that list, yes warrants have played a part, will be interesting to watch PA over coming week on all ex BF stocks
2523 2018-03-03 15:43:04 Does anyone know if @RegulationLTD stocks the different colours of CB6000?
2524 2018-03-03 15:42:48 I believe the SEC should investigate insider trading of steel stocks by @realDonaldTrump associates. Specifically Carl Icahn. #InsiderTrading
2525 2018-03-03 15:42:12 I will not be surprised if it was all scripted, but that's the way it is, no one to compete at present
2526 2018-03-03 15:42:02 And the other industrial stocks go down.
2527 2018-03-03 15:41:48 #stocks Those predicting the end of actively managed mutual funds by mid century are right. The move to passive management of index funds may come long before 2050. Over 50 mutual funds have already closed or merged and the trend continues.
2528 2018-03-03 15:41:37 Cubs won.  All stocks in my portfolio down.   Trump still

2531 2018-03-03 15:40:21 Does it not raise concerns about the SEC? Let's see them investigate claims of DTs buddy that dumped his steel stocks just days before that stupid and ignorant trade announcement by your liar-in-chief? Wtf?
2532 2018-03-03 15:39:03 Also, it's not out of the realm of possibilities for Jared to give inside information (like tariffs so you can dump your stocks) to foreign businessmen and governments. #amjoy
2533 2018-03-03 15:39:00 If you concede one minor point to the liberals they will use that as a beachhead to erode other rights. Example: the monuments. Keep bump stocks.
2534 2018-03-03 15:38:44 Cheers guys, let me check and let you know - we did but I need to check stocks!
2535 2018-03-03 15:37:54 Hello, our London Liverpool Street Station store stocks the Elizabeth Arden range. Thanks, Kirsty.
2536 2018-03-03 15:37:48 Not do-able I’m afraid - pancake supply extremely low!!! Can’t get to place that stocks them either 
2537 2018-03-03 15:36:37 GOD keeps showing the GOP & NRA the path. Pass common sense Gun Control Legislation to help protect GOD's children from mass shootings.  God bless those who gave their lives to protect the 2nd Amendment right to own an AR-15 type rifle with bump stocks & high capacity magazines.
2538 2018-03-03 15:35:52 @FifeFlyers @C_Schaber @Stocks_68 @A_Iles33 @CharlieMosey @nucci39 With all the frozen pitches today with the football. We need ours for a good/important game tonight at FIA #packthebarn #staysafe
2539 2018-03-03 15:34:03 I think I've just bought at least 30% of your cheese stocks!
2540 2018-03-03 15:33:32 Not if he bans bump stocks and raises the age limit. Dana Loesch said so on Fox News.
2541 2018-03-03 15:32:53 Icahn dumps over 31 million in steel-related stocks just before Trump’s steel tariff. I wonder how many of Trumps porn stars that will pay for. #tariffs #TrumpTariffs #draintheeconomy
2542 2018-03-03 15:32:28 ... a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, and large round mags would be a good place to start though.
2543 2018-03-03 15:32:10 I always enjoy selling off my stocks worth millions before Trump has tantrums that won't benefit me. 

But this is all after I kill the TWA. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

What the hell do we really expect from the upper echelon of American capitalism?

2547 2018-03-03 15:28:37 Gee I wonder how he knew to dump all of those stocks.
2548 2018-03-03 15:28:07 Surprised more isn't being made today of Black Rock proposing to blacklist gun stocks!

#NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
2549 2018-03-03 15:27:50 Crazy like a fox.
Trump will flip flop. 
His cronies were warned and sold their steel and aluminum stocks before he announced. 
Now they can buy low and reap the profit when stocks rebound after Trump reverses.
2550 2018-03-03 15:27:41 Just in! Trump said immigrants from Mexico cannot invest in stocks! He said "that's why they call it WALL street".
2551 2018-03-03 15:26:50 Sorry can’t let China or anyone else ruin American companies. Family first. So your stocks are going to take a hit, because you people don’t care about keeping America First. Equal trade or stick it.
2552 2018-03-03 15:26:15 The supermarkets where I live have no bread or milk, falling stocks of fresh fruit and vegetables and gaps on other shelves. I thought to myself, "This is what Brexit will be like".
2553 2018-03-03 15:26:10 She’s a lot smarter then you little larry
2554 2018-03-03 15:26:05 Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks
2555 2018-03-03 15:25:50 @Barclays @boycothumana
@realDonaldTrump 

DON'T BUY STOCKS FROM THOSE WHO STEAL FROM THE POOR!

#DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheDeepState #PatriotsUnite
2556 2018-03-03 15:25:45 who is smarter? Frustrated bears on twitter? or the bond market? 

I'll go with bonds thank you. My eye continues to be on $HYG vs $TLT & $HYG vs $IEF spreads pushing up against new 52-week highs, suggesting to me we need to be buying weakness in stocks, not selling strength $SPY
2557 2018-03-03 15:25:44 Let's see the SEC try to regain any sense of credibility by investigating the rich friends of DT that dumped steel stocks just before his ridiculous and ignorant trade announcement. America, you must be so proud.
2558 2018-03-03 15:25:25 Thanks, David! Will write / call my members of Congress every week until they fix background checks, outlaw bump stocks & extended magazines, outlaw the AR15 &its cousins. #NeverAgainMSD #MarchForOurLives
2559 2018-03-03 15:25:10 Also report about his good friend that dumped $30million plus in steel related stocks days before Trump did this.
2560 2018-03-03 15:24:14 *However*** let's leave room for the possibility that the "unglued" trade war is a spin to protect Ross (ArcelorMittal) and Carl Icahn, who dumped Manitowoc stocks days before this "surprise" annoucement that sent their value tumbling.  Either way, we're screwed.
2561 2018-03-03 15:22:43 He is trying to find his sweet spot to manipulate stocks at the risk of our country's stability
2562 2018-03-03 15:21:33 Congrats. Good looking group of stocks
2563 2018-03-03 15:21:32 when will America get rid of Trump then deal with due process! Every decision he makes R  for his stocks N shares
2564 2018-03-03 15:21:04 Didn't he make a bunch of that money by investing in distressed steel stocks?
2565 2018-03-03 15:20:49 Trump said he doesn't care for the decline in stocks with steel comments. Hilarious.
With that..Let's add the things he REALLY doesn't care about..environment..dreamers..healthcare..truth..opioid addictions..justice system..illegal loans..automatic weapons..Russian interference..
2566 2018-03-03 15:20:48 It was a public news that Trump was announcing tariffs in the morning.  Any speculation on any stocks means be ready to buy or sell. In this case we knew tariffs r going to have negative talk on news so we sold to hold our profits. Then we bought stocks when it went way down
2567 2018-03-03 15:20:04 Now let's check the stocks of companies the EU is putting new tariffs on in America. Harley Bikes, Kentucky Bourbon, Jeans so far
2568 2018-03-03 15:20:02 Love that we only see stocks discussed on days they do up ... what a coincidence.
2569 2018-03-03 15:19:56 Doing my best to get rid of the stocks
2570 2018-03-03 15:19:51 AR-15's and bump stocks are not protected by the 2nd Amendment. See Justice Scalia's opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller. That "well regulated" line actually means something.
2571 2018-03-03 15:19:32 @realDonaldTrump The 2A is not the problem. Bump stocks are not the problem. AR15s or AK47s are not the problem. Progressives R the problem.
2572 2018-03-03 15:19:05 Now you tell me. I could have bought their stocks.
2573 2018-03-03 15:18:25 Nope. They have my salary information and any official sales I have done "Stocks etc", if there is a thing I need to declare that was not notified I can do that at any time through the website.

Otherwise it's a next next finish.

I have never had to "File Taxes" in my life.
2574 2018-03-03 15:17:34 ... No Sugar Cubes?!
This is cruel and unusual! have we run out of Sugar Cube stocks?
2575 2018-03-03 15:17:30 We play everything. On Friday, we were just trading stocks in the morning, and cheap in the money options in the afternoon.
2576 2018-03-03 15:17:19 All the stocks I want in my core portfolio except Thomas Cook.
2577 2018-03-03 15:16:26 Nothing says more then National Anthem Day, then to sing sweetly into the ears of Carl Icahn to dump his millions of shares in steal stocks the day before you started your tariff war  that isn’t questionable at all....
2578 2018-03-03 15:16:23 Everyone with commonsense sold their steel stocks the day before as @realDonaldTrump said he was going to announce it in the morning. We bought the steel stock when it went down and will keep buying as it goes down selling when it’s up.
2579 2018-03-03 15:16:06 Pretty sure thats illegal. Having info on stocks before its rigged.
2580 2018-03-03 15:15:56 By acting to prevent either the banning of or placing restrictions on assault weapons, bump stocks or large capacity magazines that can easily kill a lot of people in a very short amount of time you, the members of the NRA, are all in part responsible for the murder of children.
2581 2018-03-03 15:15:10 I want him picking my stocks!
2582 2018-03-03 15:15:08 Trust us sir, @Avis @Enterprise @nationalcares @DICKS @Walmart @Delta @united will feel the wrath of real Americans. We are the ones working, traveling and have excess income. 

Can you say "falling stocks" sure I knew you could.
2583 2018-03-03 15:15:05 Junior,  We trade to make money in stocks and crypto. Most of the so called "coiners" you mention are young adult kiddies that have no clue how to trade, read charts, etc. They are mostly all going broke.
2584 2018-03-03 15:14:36 Picked the best team today from what i can see? Stocks should be saving that shot every time. V poor from him. Another apology saved in drafts
2585 2018-03-03 15:14:21 McConnell shelves gun reform...so does stupid Donnie - he’s into tariffs for a while as world stocks plunge.
2586 2018-03-03 15:13:45 The president announced tariffs on steel just to be a dick because he was having a bad day. Here is what happened after:

Steel stocks gained $2 billion in market value the day after

S&P 500 lost roughly $350 billion the same day because of the tariffs annoucement

Winning!
2587 2018-03-03 15:13:43 No foolin’!  I’d’ve settled for a fortnight in the stocks.
2588 2018-03-03 15:12:58 @smerconish if the entire universe looks at Americans as laughing stocks then yeah the last year has been a disaster. Trump doesn’t represent me that’s for sure.
2589 2018-03-03 15:12:54 Not good enough. Ban the mass shooters’ weapon of choice: the AR15 and any add-on that can accelerate firing, like bump stocks.
2590 2018-03-03 15:12:42 Yes a vast majority wants reform. For instance,  a revitalization of the NICS system, and banning bump stocks. Both things the NRA supports.
2591 2018-03-03 15:12:26 I too exit quickly once 25% gains reflected out of max gains. Like that we can trade min of 5-6 stocks per month
2592 2018-03-03 15:11:47 The stocks were for a company that uses steel to make cranes, not a company that makes/sells steel. That's why the stocks lost value.
2593 2018-03-03 15:11:33 Are bump stocks necessary? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Do people who like to use their AR's for target shooting or hunting use bump stocks? Probably not. They simply WASTE perfectly good ammo.  Even the NRA wants to get rid of bump stocks. Haven't you been listening?
2594 2018-03-03 15:11:25 Stupid Donnie’s short comings are worth it! So says Tucker Carlson. Sure if your name is Carl Icahn & you knew to dump steel stocks before stupid announced it. Can’t imagine why world stock markets plunged when tariffs announced.
2595 2018-03-03 15:11:14 what about auto stocks?
2596 2018-03-03 15:09:23 @CQVUTO.... hAVING LISTENED TO dAGEN mCDOWELL, IT IS BECOMING APPARENT SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT... tHE REASON STOCKS ARE DOWN BECAUSE Y'ALL TALK ABOUT IT..... STOP IT.....

2599 2018-03-03 15:07:28 Senator Thune: What has come from the committee you said was being set up to look into outlawing bump stocks that allow a semi-automatic weapon to be converted into an illegal machine gun? I hope it doesn't get lost in committee.
2600 2018-03-03 15:07:22 Does tipping a friend off about a #steeltariff so that he can sell his stocks beforehand constitute a high crime or misdemeanor? @cspanwj

2602 2018-03-03 15:05:06 Banning bump stocks in nonsensical and moronic.   First a bump stock can be produced with common household items by a complete idiot.  Bowing to leftist over this issue sends the wrong message and it will come back to bite us!
2603 2018-03-03 15:05:00 If you are living from paycheck to paycheck and aren't regularly saving money for the future, then you are doing something wrong and will probably regret it later.

2604 2018-03-03 15:04:00 So did he turn around and buy other steel stocks? It definitely looks overwhelmingly like he had pre-knowledge of Trump’s announcement.
2605 2018-03-03 15:03:37 Its all good - good to have some solid long term stable stocks in the PF
2606 2018-03-03 15:03:19 Yes, an assault weapon turned into a machine gun with legal high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.  What kind of hunter needs these?
2607 2018-03-03 15:03:01 Pres Trump the only crime committed with bump stocks was the Vegas Massacre which was committed by Saudis who were attempting to cover up the assasination attempt on the Crown Prince.  Tell me why bump stocks need to be banned again?
2608 2018-03-03 15:03:00 Thank you and same to you pigeon! You are an excellent and honest trader. I wish there were more like u. I cant day trade much because of work hours so i try to take positions in stocks from days to weeks usually. I lurk in #hotpecks when i can.
2609 2018-03-03 15:02:29 Preference would be stocks !
2610 2018-03-03 15:02:18 I guess Obama was thinking the same things when HE made bump stocks LEGAL & had the same opportunity to use his EXECUTIVE ORDERS HE USED ON EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WAS CRAPPY LAWS BUT DIDN’T REFORM GUN LAWS, he instituted DACA & deported DREAMers anyway! Did you judge him? Hypocrite
2611 2018-03-03 15:02:12 Pretty sure you meant, "Promote responsible gun ownership, ban bump stocks, and require universal background checks"... Oxford comma saves lives. This sounds good.
2612 2018-03-03 15:01:41 Can we ban bump stocks so you get shot a little more slowly
2613 2018-03-03 15:01:19 @jets297 I am currently in process of self teaching on stocks....a lot to know!
2614 2018-03-03 15:01:03 Number 7 ji ur the google map, u only help and show the right directions,(like  stocks...)
2615 2018-03-03 15:01:02 Huh?  Martha Stewart was jailed for lying to FBI.  What’s that got to do with Carl Icahn selling lots of stocks?
2616 2018-03-03 14:59:38 Bump stocks!? Well trump just tried to REGULATE them. Literally TWO DAYS AGO. Republicans said NO. You are brain dead. Stop reading memes.
2617 2018-03-03 14:59:22 Finally dipped my toe in stocks
2618 2018-03-03 14:59:00 Hey @CoopChardonnayy if you really know lanez tell him there's no more thugs gangsters hustlers pot heads e heads regular smokers skaters no more potential stars coming anytime soon. Well at least no more violent lanez would be a doctor and I would trade stocks @torylanez
2619 2018-03-03 14:58:09 STOCKS BOUNCE BACK DESPITE CONCERNS OVER NEW TARRIFFS
2620 2018-03-03 14:58:02 It will rise again, moron...stocks rise..and fall, and rise, and  fall...etc.
2621 2018-03-03 14:57:57 Why did Carl Icahn dump his steel stocks if these tariffs are such a good idea? @AlexWitt

2623 2018-03-03 14:57:50 @michaelgove would you like to shed some light on the PM’s words about “shared stocks” and other dubious statements regarding our future fisheries policy post Brexit? It was the most disconcerting element of her speech yesterday. Are we selling our fishermen down the river?
2624 2018-03-03 14:57:41 Steel stocks went up after the announcement so it cost him a lot of money.
2625 2018-03-03 14:56:03 Forex,Stocks and Bonds.
2626 2018-03-03 14:55:45 So what did tRump do with his stocks? Did he sell or lose?
2627 2018-03-03 14:55:43 Sick? Don’t call me sick when what is sick is a society who lets an 18-year old with mental problems buy guns, ammo, and bump stocks.
2628 2018-03-03 14:55:28 @smerconish tell me how carl icahn knew to sell 31 million dollars worth of steel stocks right before trump announced his tarrifs and trade war???
2629 2018-03-03 14:55:00 The 2nd amendment  was written at a time when the weapon of choice was a musket and we did have the national protection we have now. The supreme court ruled that the 2nd doesn't cover assault rifles, so in highly doubt it covers bump-stocks.
2630 2018-03-03 14:54:41 Or he heard about the possible tariff and dumped stocks on his own because he knew what a tariff would do. Meredith.
2631 2018-03-03 14:54:32 May bagong labas nanaman sa oppo. Di na ulit nagkaroon ng system update mga dating stocks. @OPPOPhilippines anuna???
2632 2018-03-03 14:54:24 No mention of stocks going down as your approval ratings?  And how about the countries who are retaliating against us with tariffs because you think your ideas will work. You are destroying us. Make America worse than ever
2633 2018-03-03 14:54:15 The idiot didn't consider just how many food pantry items are in those plate
steel cans...soups, veggies, sauces, broth/stocks, baby items....etc.
2634 2018-03-03 14:53:34 Trump said he will ban bump stocks via EO in coming weeks and supports a ban on assault rifles, as well as raising the age to buy guns.
2635 2018-03-03 14:53:34 Wow one day sold out kagad stocks ng Pure Wild Honey!! Thank you dear clients!! — feeling thankful
2636 2018-03-03 14:53:29 sell GM and Ford stocks?
2637 2018-03-03 14:53:28 Rumor has it that there was at least one steel investor who dumped their stock before @POTUS tariff announcement. #Sessions need to look at steel stocks and see who else had previous notification. Can you say insider trading? #Resist #LiarInChief #CheaterInChief
2638 2018-03-03 14:52:50 They don't care about America, they care about having a healthy military spending and nice stocks for Raytheon, Rand Corp, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, et cetera. Also, Osama was in Afghanistan...
2639 2018-03-03 14:52:13 1. $BRK.B BV to compound 8-12% even with new CEO with little decade downside 
2. Basket of Tobacco stocks - best long term record of all asset classes
2640 2018-03-03 14:51:44 That focus is political. Cons spent a decade howling about the long gun registry, then cancelled it when they came to power. Result is that you can buy ar-15s and their ilk. But not bump stocks, that shit is illegal.
2641 2018-03-03 14:50:31 Please talk to your dad Don and Eric. It would be a shame if your dad bans bump stocks or AR's or even raising the age. You're a smart man Jr. You KNOW that those things are NOT the problem. I voted for your dad because I thought if anything he'd scale back old bad gun laws. smh
2642 2018-03-03 14:49:36 Thank God he took your advice and avoided investing in any Internet stocks and put all his money into Fax machine companies. That should make up for any real estate losses.
2643 2018-03-03 14:49:30 Banning AR 15 s doesn't infringe on the right to bear arms.  You can still bear arms, just not that type.  If bump stocks should be banned then AR 15 s can also be banned by your own logic.

2647 2018-03-03 14:47:21 No. Liberalism should be banned. That’s what killed those kids, not bump stocks.
2648 2018-03-03 14:47:05 You forgot to add the ban on weapons with ar-15 killing capability and bump stocks.
2649 2018-03-03 14:46:13 I can't support someone who doesn't know their party's position on certain issues. One day he spouts drivel about an assault weapons ban and then the next day he says he doesn't want that. Like with the bump stocks.
2650 2018-03-03 14:44:52 no because what makes a weapon an assault weapon is just features on a weapon that don't make it any more effective in killing than any other weapon. (grips, folding stocks, threaded barrel, etc...) has nothing to do with how it operates.
2651 2018-03-03 14:44:31 ..@JDSports LEAVE IT ..I'll get them direct from kickers.Can't be doing with this nonsense . Rang oldham they're not sure WHO stocks them!?
2652 2018-03-03 14:43:39 Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks - The Washington Posthttps://apple.news/Aq3K9sTwLQZyVX7lbNxE-Ow
2653 2018-03-03 14:42:34 Apologies for any inconvenience. Hopefully we'll have new stocks in place very soon.
2654 2018-03-03 14:42:28 Trump will flip flop. 
His cronies have sold their steel and aluminum stocks before he announced. 
Now they can buy low and reap the profit when stocks rebound after Trump reverses.
2655 2018-03-03 14:41:57 @blackrock Asking gun manufacturers about their intentions is NOT enough; why trade in gun stocks? Not only are they a bad investment currently, but there are 10s of millions of guns in the U.S. - no further guns are needed.  Take an ethical stand!
2656 2018-03-03 14:41:48 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2657 2018-03-03 14:40:33 And make sure your broker gets rid of your gun stocks!!
2658 2018-03-03 14:40:27 2018 is going to be a year without trend. It is going to be year for trader's and not investors as Nifty is going to be highly volatile and won't move in a trend.

2660 2018-03-03 14:39:58 I wish you could tell me about the good things he's done. Tax cut is a failure, tariffs? Enjoy spending an extra $3500 for your next car according to Wilbur Ross. Do you have stocks? Mine are lower than when he took office. Only hires the best people? Obviously wrong.
2661 2018-03-03 14:38:57 Nganong mas nindot og mas daghan og variety ang stocks sa Daiso sa Starmall Talisay kysa sa Ayala?
2662 2018-03-03 14:38:10 Is there a point to this story? Ichan missed out on the stock price bump in US steel manufacturing stocks caused by the tariffs.
2663 2018-03-03 14:38:04 January 2018 I pulled all of my 401K stocks OUT of American companies. My account has  done well in the EU while many of my coworkers have seen a steady decline. Trump is going to bankrupt America.
2664 2018-03-03 14:37:14 Just an exec order on bump stocks...
2665 2018-03-03 14:36:17 @johngranato Coors stocks have been steadily going down for the past few weeks. I wonder why?
2666 2018-03-03 14:35:41 what I can say...Wilbur Ross needs to be investigated as well...I'm sure some legal team is looking into this fellow's finances, stocks and off shore accounts....especially at some of those cyprus banks....
2667 2018-03-03 14:34:55 It's insane and they need to stop validating such dangerous opinions by having on people who continue to insist there is a case for owning bump stocks and assault weapons. What was the name of the looney they had on?
2668 2018-03-03 14:34:11 Lying Ted steel stocks took off called taking profit
2669 2018-03-03 14:33:17 Not enough. Not nearly enough. We want AR-15s banned. Bump stocks banned. Anything that allows auto- multiple shots per minute banned.
2670 2018-03-03 14:33:14 How is that insider trading, it's common knowledge that Wilbur Ross recommended a tariff be placed on steel imports. Because of this, I purchased steel stocks and didn't need any insider information.
2671 2018-03-03 14:33:08 Hey, it alreadydid its job. Trump's cronies sold steel and aluminum stocks before they dropped.
Now they can buy low, Trump will flip flop, and when they go back up, big profit.
Winning!
2672 2018-03-03 14:32:54 "sa ngayon talo ka pero don't worry darating din yung point na mababawi mo yang stocks mo na nawala."

2674 2018-03-03 14:31:58 I love the Dreamers. Bring me a bill to sign. 
Later ... I'm not signing anything to save the Dreamers. 

I'm going to ban assault weapons and bump stocks and raise the age.
Later ... the NRA is great, says gun laws are fine as they are!
2675 2018-03-03 14:31:33 Mike. Once again man... Your deflecting !!!! Just answer th question... What has he been so right about ? You do understand that every off the wall, irresponsible tweet he does, effects stocks, global stability etc.. tell us what has he been so right about ?
2676 2018-03-03 14:30:47 Oh yeah, I just purchased steel stocks a couple of weeks ago based on the knowledge of Wilber Ross's tariff recommendation. You don't need insider information if you follow what is happening in the world. Get real!
2677 2018-03-03 14:30:33 Richard Keys should be put in the stocks and pelted at the end of the season for that quote. Literally the worst call a pundit has ever made.
2678 2018-03-03 14:30:32 I remember him speaking highly of Alcoa. If US aluminum and steel production increase of course stocks increase. Its all about his bottom line.
2679 2018-03-03 14:29:33 When ppl invest in stocks (mutual funds, pensions etc) they want to see growth, naturally. Companies must continually show bigger profits, and that often results in job losses. Or, environmental destruction... things we don't like.
2680 2018-03-03 14:27:32 atleast this fund house is highly bullish on india ............ I am also holding all cyclical stocks
2681 2018-03-03 14:26:51 Thou shalt not kill.  Ban AR-15s and semi-automatic guns and bump stocks.

Especially the ones where they get shares 10% less than mid price at any day of their choosing days before conversion. On the plus side if you know where the floor is you can make decent cash on the bounce
2687 2018-03-03 14:22:09 All this hassle, angst, uncertainty, complexity & risk  - just so we can plunder North Sea fish stocks & ignore common sense regulations.... Here’s an idea: let’s admit it would be a cake & arse party and #Remain instead #bbcaq
2688 2018-03-03 14:22:07 trochu Vám tam vypadlo, co dělal celou dobu Bureš spasitel a s kým vším to pekl dohromady.... A jinak, co dodat - oni jsou jako my, volby zatím všechny od 1990 byly svobodné, tak to asi musí odpovídat ;-)
2689 2018-03-03 14:22:04 Considering you can 3D print pretty much anything you might as well just say this about every single. This is a piss poor argument against banning bumping stocks. Banning them would easily minimize the amount in circulation in US. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that.
2690 2018-03-03 14:22:02 JFC no wonder Repugs r so oblivious to the truth, while @msnbc is reporting @washingtonpost article abt former advisor to @WhiteHouse Carl Icahn selling $M in steel-related stocks shortly BEFORE #DotardDonnie announced #tariffs @FoxNews is waxing poetic abt Huckabee resignation

2692 2018-03-03 14:21:45 Why is anyone surprised at the insider trading accusation? Trump's buddy just happened to sell off his steel stocks a week before the tariff announcement...wait, you mean they act like criminals!!!!! Who knew, haha.
2693 2018-03-03 14:21:02 Mnuchin is flabbergasted. Hahaha HOW can he answer without admitting the massive tax grab for the 1%? 10% of people own 82% of stocks. Great. News talking about how close we're coming to nuclear war- @realDonaldTrump is crazier than Kim Jung Un, FAR crazier. #Antichrist
2694 2018-03-03 14:20:24 Ted steel stocks went up after announcement as much as I’d like to back you on this but any one who dumped before would have made more had they just held
2695 2018-03-03 14:19:10 Turns out Oleg Deripaske dumped Aluminum stocks as well. Trump tipped off the Russians.

So Icahn the #2 Oligarch.
2696 2018-03-03 14:16:40 Do you invest your family in stocks only or MF as well...

2698 2018-03-03 14:16:05 @NRA opposes banning of bump stocks. Who can even imagine a reason they would? These are very sick people!    More @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN
2699 2018-03-03 14:15:29 The "problem" is that people don't want to pay more for the coin. Even before the redemption, the going price was about $0.00003...now it is not that far off $0.03. Even normal stocks dip after a reverse split. There is nothing fraudulent going on.

2702 2018-03-03 14:14:20 Hey Donny, where is this executive order banning bump stocks? You signed very many in your first days in office, you should have this done by now. More bullshit from the PIG in charge
2703 2018-03-03 14:14:15 By the mentally ill. It’s far from a gun problem. Bump stocks... yeah I don’t think they are necessary. Are they cool, yes, but you don’t need them. But you ppl need to look at the real problem and it’s not the guns.
2704 2018-03-03 14:12:07 How do you typically play stocks that gap up above your buy trigger like $CNAT?  Wait for a opening range break to enter? Would your stop go at the low of the entry days candle or your typical 3 day low stop?  Thanks for all your help, have a good weekend!
2705 2018-03-03 14:11:33 Banning bump stocks is futile in its concept. We humans will just invent something to replace it with. We're ingenious in our ability to overcome obstacles. Want, not necessity is the mother of invention. That's where the bump stock came from in the first place.
2706 2018-03-03 14:11:26 Someone I know from childhood got a tax refund of over $13,000 because she has 4 kids. She BLEW IT 4 day buying unnecessary things. 

Another friend of mine gave me $1,000 to invest in stocks, in 8 days, this person passed $10,000 mark......with just $1,000 investment.
2707 2018-03-03 14:11:02 The hits keep comin'. Trump out of nowhere, blurts out new tariffs for steel & aluminum just a week after Carl Icahn dumps 31 mil in steel stocks, avoiding losses when stock market reacted to Trumps brainstorm from the white outhouse.
2708 2018-03-03 14:10:43 The Qatar blockade after refusing a loan to Jared?  The $180,000,000 loan from the hedge fund guyvto Jared after a White House visit. Carl Icahn selling off steel dependent stocks BEFORE the tariff announcement.  There’s a few examples for you.

2711 2018-03-03 14:09:46 #georgesoros the #antiAmerican ring leader has purchased in this last quarter  $160 million dollars worth of stocks in 11 big oil, natural gas and coal companies!  He's making investments in the very companies he continuously blames for climate change.  Hmm...strange right?

2714 2018-03-03 14:08:01 Coming out slowly is Carl Icahn’s dropping stocks day or 2 before Trump’s tariff temper tantrum. Friend of President. Hopefully this will gain greater notice. SEC, are you listening?

2721 2018-03-03 14:06:24 @mattletiss7 is spot on about #var. I thought this after the #thfc game. 

Should've started simple. Just use VAR for Pen or not, perhaps then offside or not.

2722 2018-03-03 14:05:25 The colonial police force defending the destruction of wild salmon stocks. Disgusting.
2723 2018-03-03 14:05:18 Somehow a day before steel tariff announced Carl Ichan dumps 31 mil in steel related stocks. Hmmm how did that happen. Corruption at its finest.
2724 2018-03-03 14:04:36 FU.  Did all your friends manage to dump their stocks before your announcement?  You really want war in any form don’t you?  The American people will be hurt in this.
2725 2018-03-03 14:04:22 That doesn't make sense fake news! Why would he sell before the stocks go up?!!
2726 2018-03-03 14:03:56 exactly. I too would get a lot of bull for using the same.
said that I should keep that shitmeme in the stocks.
2727 2018-03-03 14:02:46 This is my dream trip to NYC, not kidding. Happy Hour (caps like a holiday, lol)  with Guy Adami talking stocks (no sports) classic cars, Fast Money gossip... I can't hit the mark, land-poor. 130 acres prime. ~~ I was at Lincoln Center for the show in Sept, '08. Somber mood.
2728 2018-03-03 14:02:29 I don’t understand, why they go for a 3(a)10 route, there are lots of financing options, that 3(a)10 is worst than toxic financing, imagine you give NBF a .001 conversion while stocks trading at .006-007.... $SRMX
2729 2018-03-03 14:02:06 Hey James! I'm so sorry about this. I've fed this back to the Store Manager to ensure all stocks are monitored. - Sidra
2730 2018-03-03 14:01:40 So sell steel and alu stocks; buy plant based plastics. gotcha
2731 2018-03-03 14:00:42 Cant wait for stocks to come back. Got a few candidates in mind 
2732 2018-03-03 14:00:18 my friend bought stocks but im still asking what are the sizes available hehe
2733 2018-03-03 14:00:18 Stocks on our List for 4 Days Last Week: $ASND $AXGN $BA $ETSY $HLG $IBKR $NKTR $NVDA $PSTG $RNG $TGTX $WIFI
2734 2018-03-03 14:00:05 So, I have gained many new followers. (much love to each of you) & w/ that said, this admin is so bad. 45 giving his buddy a heads up on his announcement of the tariffs & the buddy sells his 3.5 million in his steel stocks... RIGHT IN OUR FACES!!! Didn't Martha go to jail 4 that?
2735 2018-03-03 13:59:56 @jimcramer Is it to early to say we saw the start of a rotation into tech stocks yestarday?
2736 2018-03-03 13:59:34 Yep, P/E compression is coming for U.S. stocks.
2737 2018-03-03 13:58:41 Why should we own bump stocks
2738 2018-03-03 13:58:33 About 3 months ago I did the "George Costanza" and bought a trio of "opposites" since I usually only buy divy payers. $SQ, $TDOC, $TTD. Sometimes it pays to do the opposite! #financialliteracy #stocks #Seinfeld
2739 2018-03-03 13:58:25 Lol, I think that's the point...Trump is profiting off of this somehow. He introduced volatility into the market, his friends sell off their stocks beforehand, he comes back later changing his mind, stock prices rise, and another windfall. 

The guy owes hundreds of millions.
2740 2018-03-03 13:58:15 And the Constitution  doesn't say  about bump stocks!
2741 2018-03-03 13:58:14 Oh Lord.  This is Econ 101.  IT DOESNT WORK!!!!   Inflation. Stocks drop. This is a huge cost for our economy....  and for what?  Maybe a few thousand jobs?  Trump is an idiot.
2742 2018-03-03 13:57:48 Suggest some good stocks
2743 2018-03-03 13:56:25 Interesting thought.
No one knew the announcement was coming out until it actually came out. There was no prep time, except for WH insiders.
I’d like to see SEC filings on POTUS, cabinet and advisors if they shorted stocks prior to the announcement and next week
2744 2018-03-03 13:56:25 Stocks for the village idiot, ducking stool for suspected witches, ridge and furrow crop planting... it’s clearly the way to go! 
2745 2018-03-03 13:55:55 General metric to either take trades or stay away. Reversal is tradable in spx or stocks w similar behavior. Or take traded in stocks w relative strength (stronger than other stocks)
2746 2018-03-03 13:54:21 Dude I just remembered I gave MY CAR to Sherry after Cincy for her to drive back to Dover and I jumped in Stocks truck w u guys to keep going

It seems I cannot make up my mind on those two. Any help would be much appreciated! TIA
2748 2018-03-03 13:51:42 What are the odds Carl Icahn would dump $31 million of steel related stocks right before his good buddy @realDonaldTrump tanked them with his tariffs? I'm old enough to remember Martha Stewart going to prison for less than 1% of that. #AMJoy

2749 2018-03-03 13:49:47 Hmmm... what the president said he wanted is a good start: raise age to 21, tighten background checks and ban bump stocks.
2750 2018-03-03 13:48:28 Not much missed in markets,a few names doing quite well.BTC and marijuana sectors still quite volatile and down from Jan. highs.

2755 2018-03-03 13:45:36 Hasn't touched these stocks since 2015? What an amazing coincidence to dump them right before Trump announcement,  insider trading?
2756 2018-03-03 13:45:10 Are the stocks even safe? Even though they may show in accounts they could have been sold also.

2763 2018-03-03 13:42:03 And yet Carl Icahn dumped millions in steel related stocks just in time...
2764 2018-03-03 13:42:00 Cyclically Adjusted PE ratio in the US is at 29x and market cap to GDP is at 150%+, both near all-time historical highs, and there’s “fear”? Valuations of stocks seem to me like maximum greed. By this scale, there must have been “fear” after the first 10% dip in 1929!!
2765 2018-03-03 13:41:59 Shockingly, I am not ignorant. It's called basic logic. Who decides the necessity of bump stocks but not nukes? How about everything in between? Slippery slope.
2766 2018-03-03 13:41:36 I was ok with what you said until you started firing law enforcement that is even more dedicated now than ever.  You need them to figure out what went wrong.   And, get assault rifles and bump stocks out of the general population.
2767 2018-03-03 13:41:18 La masse des stocks options ou actions gratuites représentent un montant infime par rapport au total! Il ne faut pas être obnubilé par qqes "riches" sans scrupule, ce genre d'individu se rencontre dans la même proportion dans toutes les classes de la société.

2772 2018-03-03 13:39:12 FL residents I mean. Gun stocks are dropping, if they have less $!so will NRA. Keep up the good work! Keep spotlight on these issues
2773 2018-03-03 13:38:57 You're confusing having some limitations on guns and not having any guns. Your snitty "History much?" is only valid if almost all the people had NO guns. Putting some limitations on guns (like simply banning bump stocks) is NOT THE SAME.
2774 2018-03-03 13:38:45 Pero pag nagdidiscuss talaga si Sir Aguilar, gusto ko bumili agad ng stocks HAHAHAHA PERO I HAVE NO MONEY
2775 2018-03-03 13:38:39 The Irony of someone whose moniker includes “BoycottNRA” claiming no Democrat wants to take away guns. Can we assume you will stop at bump stocks and raising the legal age to own rifles to 21? Lol! Where do they get these people?
2776 2018-03-03 13:38:24 A Few other Stocks Moving higher Yesterday Of Interest to Me were $ANET $RP $TWTR $AYX $ $TNET $BLD $YY $RHT and 3 MACD Crossovers $EW $FLT $NTRS $MKSI $ALGN -Look like Shoppers of Positions were Out- LOL
2777 2018-03-03 13:38:12 Trade war has good and bad outcomes. For made in USA companies like $TSLA, trade war may actually have a favorable outcome. No need to go completely bearish. Just need to pick stocks carefully.
2778 2018-03-03 13:36:59 For people who go all in on a few stocks, they may suffer major losses after epic gains. For those who diversify, the hurt is less, and for those who diversify and trade the daily movement, they are still profitable. The market crashes because of "sheepole" panic and run.

2780 2018-03-03 13:36:04 Thanks for the response and thanks for buying stocks when share holders are upset. Even though you buy small positions that gives us assurance that we need not worry. It hurts to see the stock fall though especially for margin traders this will be a disaster.
2781 2018-03-03 13:34:19 Global tech stocks (easy), foreign environmental tech, etc.
2782 2018-03-03 13:33:37 I grabbed some at 2.90 it should get back into the 3s
2783 2018-03-03 13:33:09 This is BS!! Nobody is looking to take peoples guns away except for AR15 assault rifles & bump stocks!! Most Americans also support stronger background checks!! This is the least we can do for our children!!
2784 2018-03-03 13:32:20 Just get into rental property. A good place to start is the bible belt. You can buy up large land for cheap and make easy money. Get into stocks from that point. It also helps that I am a heart and brain doctor.
2785 2018-03-03 13:32:02 Quick, is this from The Onion or Deseret News? 

"The church invests the money, Bishop Caussé said, following the lesson taught by Jesus Christ in the parable of the talents, by investing in stocks and bonds, agriculture, majority interests in taxable businesses"
2786 2018-03-03 13:30:19 I m giving safe bets where valuations comfort will always remain also I prefer high Promotor Holdings, future growth, then I am suggesting the stock, I mostly avoid giving risky overvalued stocks
2787 2018-03-03 13:29:08 Can you get dividends from buying stocks on robinhood
2788 2018-03-03 13:27:54 At times they are and at times they are not. I remember the late ‘70s when stocks and bonds went down together and the late ‘00s when bonds surged while stocks collapsed. What’s important is to appreciate that correlation is dynamic. Correlation shifts.
2789 2018-03-03 13:27:29 As one of your much more liberal followers NO. Not repealed. Just universal backgrounds and military type guns only for military and
Police. Ban bump stocks. This is all we are asking. Common sense.

Wow, Trump confidant Carl Icahn is such a LUCKY GUY. 

Right before Trump announces a steel tariff that tanks manufacturing stocks, he dumped 1 MILLION SHARES of the one of the companies that was hardest hit. 

Such a fortunate coincidence.

2812 2018-03-03 13:12:06 NRA has used it's money and influence to set gun policy. Instead of sensible regulations that would ultimately protect people and 2ndA rights they defended bump stocks, sold fear, and fought universal background checks. It's like making it easy for criminals to arms = more sales.
2813 2018-03-03 13:12:02 @realDonaldTrump all of a sudden Trumps rich friend dumps his stocks in aluminum shortly before Trump declares a tariff on aluminum! REALLY?
2814 2018-03-03 13:10:52 He has been selling on other stocks too. Any idea why he is suddenly selling on other stocks too?

2818 2018-03-03 13:09:08 The Republicans are cutting social programs. Now their Tariffs are about to sink the Stock Market. Our retirement savings are in stocks. They want everyone to have more concealed guns. I wonder what that's all about? Maybe they want people to shoot each other for the few crumbs.

No feeling on that? Think maybe the founding fathers would think the way we’re living now is disastrous? Destructive? 
I mean, the closest thing they had to bump stocks was a fucking cannon - quit hiding behind outdated ideas
2825 2018-03-03 13:07:26 Curious. I'm guessing you invest in regular stocks, as well. Do you ever share your thoughts on these?   Love your positive energy.
2826 2018-03-03 13:07:15 So they buy back their own stocks at higher prices so pay more when they themselves increased the price themselves? Go do your research again.
2827 2018-03-03 13:06:21 I remember how @KimKardashian used to be in love with @ReggieBush. She used to be stuck on him and hurt.  It gives me hope knowing my kanye can be here any min.  *waits on my 3 babies, a wall of roses, a bomb proposal, and Amazon stocks*

2830 2018-03-03 13:05:14 Russia dropping selling steel stocks just before Trump imposed a tariff sounds like a planned event to me.
2831 2018-03-03 13:04:40 Don’t really understand why everyone stocks up on bread and milk in a potential crisis. Those two products are going out of date and mouldy quicker than anything else in the supermarket. Fucking tools.
2832 2018-03-03 13:04:31 Aren’t these individuals able to cross state lines and legally purchase guns?The NRA wants to make conceal carry transferable from state to state without having to register.Are bump stocks (sp) still legal.If there were NO GUNS , there would be NO MASS SHOOTINGS. That’s the point

2836 2018-03-03 13:04:13 So? And who are they buying these stocks from? There stocks are becoming more valuable and will benefit those who own them in their retirement portfolio. And many other repatriated companies with their billions come back to thd US, pay taxes on their billions, reinvest it in
2837 2018-03-03 13:03:39 Knives used to kill do so as a secondary purpose and cars have far more regulation than guns do. Most of us don't want to get rid of guns. We want to ban bump stocks, increase background checks, debt guns to people with domestic violence convictions, etc. Y'know, regulations.

2846 2018-03-03 12:59:24 Hmm. What would it look like to put skills on a line graph like stocks..? With fluctuations to value? Is that available somewhere?
2847 2018-03-03 12:58:48 yo brah, did you sell any stocks before the tariff announcement?
2848 2018-03-03 12:58:13 Short strangle and short straddle is aggressive strategy for range bound stocks. Sun Pharma gives lots of liquidity, hence perfect candidate for straddles/strangles.

2852 2018-03-03 12:57:42 #Loser Trump had only 1 thing he was "#winning" at. The stock market rising. So the big drop in stocks last week after Trump's Tariffs "angry & unglued" announcement may change Trump's mind. This possibility is likely why #stocks bounced a bit on Friday, not collapsing further.

2857 2018-03-03 12:52:35 Thanks, very good strategy! I started buying such stocks after the mining scam in 2011. Thanks again for sharing 
2858 2018-03-03 12:52:15 @realDonaldTrump and his advisors dumped their steel and aluminum stocks just prior to Trump announcing upcoming tariffs.  That is called "insider trading" and is a criminal offense--and MUST be prosecuted.

2884 2018-03-03 12:28:51 well being a pure value investor i like buying stocks with considerable margin of safety but for a growth investor it might work very well as explained by you.

2886 2018-03-03 12:25:55 Didn’t the stocks go up? Why would he dump stock on insider trading that went up? Liberal logic I guess.

2888 2018-03-03 12:23:51 So Carl sells 31M in stocks before Trump announced tariffs. Isn’t this what Martha Stewart went to jail for, a little insider trading?
2889 2018-03-03 12:23:45 Everything is a racket w/these guys. Aren't they also front-running aluminum and steel stocks in the weeks before the tariff announcements.
2890 2018-03-03 12:23:37 Great work. Follow up question. Do you think because most of the expensive valuation now is in a handful of stocks (FANG for example) that dispersion from the mean as a whole is less now vs 2000?  Or maybe the fact even expensive today has EBIT vs 2000?
2891 2018-03-03 12:23:26 Corporations are not people. People are taxed on income, corporations-such as industry-have equipment, inventory,  SSI, healthcare, stocks, dividends...much more complex.
But corporations are made up of the people they hire and pay
2892 2018-03-03 12:22:27 Look im alright for banning bump stocks and having better background checks but idk if changing the age will help anything...and dont try to take them...i think we need better resource officers and a few armed teachers
2893 2018-03-03 12:21:40 They need make an example of him just like they did with Martha Stewart. I don't get inside information to trade my stocks, why should this guy?
2894 2018-03-03 12:21:39 Apologies for not replying yesterday. Yes, stocks allowing - it's very busy in the shop & we're not able to check social media full time - but if you wanted to call to check you can always get an update that way.
2895 2018-03-03 12:21:04 But his buddy Carl Icahn made a fortune. Oh, he dumped his affected stocks right before trump’s trade war announcement. Very prescient of him.

2916 2018-03-03 12:03:38 That’s not the point.

2941 2018-03-03 11:39:19 Thanks BB. Thinking of gradually reducing Portfolio down to C:20 stocks. I have a bit less confidence in a number of my smaller positions. That would also free up cash for a few short term trades.
2942 2018-03-03 11:39:12 A) steel prices dropped after a short rise
But that’s not what this is about
B) stocks in industries dependent on steel dropped, which is what he sold

2970 2018-03-03 11:14:32 Nice one, bookmarked now, will be interesting to check that lists £Caps at year end and even year end 2019. Some stonking stocks offered up there by punters (and a few I wouldn't invest £1 in!) I3E has pushed on already missed that one
2971 2018-03-03 11:12:45 He supports NRA, #2A but Potus also wants American #1 schools&children to be safe from mentally ill cases, and rapid fire bump stocks outlawed & law enforcement to be able to have rights to do their jobs better. It shouldnt be hard to figure this out.He point blankly said it.
2972 2018-03-03 11:12:11 Our fab village shop @CotherstonePO has stocks of bread, milk, local meat, homemade cakes, wine, cheese & craft ales.
They even offered to bring provisions to us if we couldn't get to them.
Can @Tesco @sainsburys or @asda offer such amazing #CustomerService ?
2973 2018-03-03 11:10:16 STOCKS WILL ALWAYS BE ON A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. BUT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN THIS HIGH.."EVER"....P.S. TAX CUTS FOR EVERYONE, NOT THE 1%.#FakeNews P.S.S. UN REGISTER. LIKE MORNING JOE, & CHRIS SUPRUN.
2974 2018-03-03 11:10:15 ...in the next breath she says we will have better quotas & the big compromise is “we will share stocks with EU” that’s taking back control??
2975 2018-03-03 11:09:20 Graphs just follow the news. Forget them. Bitcoin is actually doing well IMO - not so much all the altcoins but the recent crash in stocks and such will be good for crypto market.
2976 2018-03-03 11:07:28 Analysis of detailed model risk of a company could make one over confident and bet more on a single or few stocks. But more study does not mean more profits.
2977 2018-03-03 11:07:12 Sorry jako, ale zatím jsme ještě nikdy nebyli tak daleko zpět, jako teď. A to hlavně díky voličům Babiše, kteří naskakují na tyto laciné argumenty a mají minimálně jedno oko zavřené. Děkuji Vám a ať Vám ten koblih zaskočí...
2978 2018-03-03 11:02:11 I'd like to know if friends of his are now buying the same stocks in preparation for when he announces he isn't going to follow through on the tariffs.  This could just be a total gaming of the system.
2979 2018-03-03 11:02:10 Current Top 10 Holdings in descending value - #XLM, #RFX, #CAML, #MPAC, #SPE, #RWS, #GFM, #DGOC, #SOM, #HAT. 47% of Portfolio. 34 Stocks held.

2981 2018-03-03 10:59:35 They seem to be forgetting that the AR-15s used in the recent shootings are easily equipped with bump stocks, effectively making them full auto.

After all, why would the AR-15 be the weapon of choice of mass shooters if it was just the same as other semi-automatics?
2982 2018-03-03 10:59:32 Stories that Trump angrily struck out with trade tariffs ignore that two different people were warned he was doing it so they could dump their steel & aluminum stocks. So he at least stewed over it for a week or so. Still no planning, etc, but not a 5 minute freakout, either.
2983 2018-03-03 10:58:47 Already got rid of affected stocks
2984 2018-03-03 10:57:52 Agreed, there is a very public, ritual humiliation element to it. Like the online version of the stocks but for doing your job or going above and beyond rather than committing a crime.
2985 2018-03-03 10:52:57 The last person to speak to Donny about gun violence was the #NRA, so consider your bump stocks safe.

2987 2018-03-03 10:51:38 But they do have semiautomatic rifles with large magazines and bump stocks that easily shoot 100s of bullets in a minute or two. People stand a better chance against a rifle with just a few bullets..
2988 2018-03-03 10:51:28 This craze for no spare tyre is crazy. Get a puncture and your fecked. Even worse with @MitsubishiUK as no one stocks the tyre size!
2989 2018-03-03 10:50:48 I imagine the Quinua stocks in the south east are pretty low right about now.

2998 2018-03-03 10:43:53 Indications are that most of the fish stocks in British waters are seriously depleted.And how would you ‘police’ a licence system? Foreign fishermen have proved to be inscrupulous eg forbidden trawlers in Scottish lochs.
2999 2018-03-03 10:42:36 Y si, es así nomas.
Los stocks energéticos e infraestructurales se consumieron y -debe saber- llevan años reponerlos.

3008 2018-03-03 10:36:39 Yeah, some stocks go into these oscillating zones that are perfect for these scalping strategies.

3010 2018-03-03 10:35:56 Cut off by snow for 12 hours now. Whiskey stocks holding up but vodka gone, beer, wine, rum & gin all dangerously low. I’m just stepping out to the off licence, I may be some time.
3011 2018-03-03 10:33:51 btw ja urcite nejsem z tech, kterym by ztrata #cnb_cz nedala spat :) to by urcite z meho pohledu nemel byt ustredni bod diskuze o zavazku; spis jen zkousim argumentovat v tom smyslu, ze nebylo nutne, aby ke ztrate doslo v takovem rozsahu
3012 2018-03-03 10:31:28 jde o to, ze commitment exitu po vyssi inflaci musi prijit pred zavadenim zavazku, verim, ze by to vytvorilo vyssi inflacni ocekavani a realna sazba by sla dolu vice; nabidkovy sok cely proces prodluzuje a ztezuje, ale na podstate, ze reagovali malo agresivne, to nic nemeni
3013 2018-03-03 10:30:17 tomu uplne nerozumim; ta Svenssonova myslenka je v tom, ze pokud by se zavazali zavazek ukoncit az vyvoj cenove hladiny vymaze oslabeni nomin.kurzu a mezera realn. kurzu se uzavre, nemelo by smysl se dostavat do spekulativnich pozic a nedoslo by k masivnim spekulacim pred exitem

3017 2018-03-03 10:28:21 No, it is there.. Still intact. We knew the follies of buying HFC stocks in a down cycle of interest rates, thats why we bought only DHFL.
3018 2018-03-03 10:28:08 @POTUS How is that Executive Order coming regarding BUMP STOCKS? Remember, you said “It’s Done” I’m going to get this done by EXECUTIVE ORDER!  We the people are waiting! Oh, I think you need to speak with @SenateMajLdr because he is dragging his ass on Gun Control Legislation.
3019 2018-03-03 10:27:34 presne :) zacit hned po dosednuti na ZLB a udelat to agresivneji ve stylu Svenssona, mohli byt venku daleko drive a zadna huge ztrata by se v mediich neustale neresila, protoze by sem ten predexitovskej spek. kapital nenatekl

3023 2018-03-03 10:21:59 Thing here is not every stock can give positive return even over long term.
Right stocks and right attitude matters.
3024 2018-03-03 10:18:34 No you can’t. But I and the vast majority of gun owners have no problem with banning or at the very least reclassify bump stocks to a class 3 item.
3025 2018-03-03 10:17:54 Pero mejor emitir ordenes el lunes, no? Las ordenes de  mejor a mercado, no?
3026 2018-03-03 10:17:32 Mot talking about the bump stocks. Talking about his meeting after when he said we need more thorough background checks etc amd the Gops at the meeting nearly chocked to death and dems applauded him for his stance

3029 2018-03-03 10:14:13 The good Senator has consistently been submitting bills to ban bump stocks and assault weapons...well before the latest school murders. What have you done for humanity lately? Have a good night?
3030 2018-03-03 10:13:41 Come up with a data product for small businesses that wish to incorporate IT in their businesses. Let's say a guy who deals with security cameras that require WiFi or pubs, movie shops, cafes,  small hospitals that want to use systems to transact and monitor stocks
3031 2018-03-03 10:12:38 receive clearance letter from police psychologist or other official with responsibility of clearing police officers with shots fired incidents. 

4) High Capacity Magazines and Bump Stocks
a) Must be outlawed or banned. There is no need for either in a hunting situation.
3032 2018-03-03 10:12:27 jde spíše o to, kolik občanů nechtělo ani Babiše , ani Zemana. Vy se oháníte vítězstvím většiny. Není vás většina a brzy to poznáte.
3033 2018-03-03 10:10:14 Looting a country for 60 can be a brag only for a true Congressi slave. Lage raho. NE to bas jhanki hai 2019 ki burnol abhi baaki hai. Apne stocks abhi pure kar lo baad mein pata ni mile na mile.. 
3034 2018-03-03 10:10:08 Tell that to the parents of the massacred children.
These massacres will continue until these weapons of war are banned. It's that simple.Children or semi- automatic weapons and bump stocks.Most Americans choose safe children. And,we voting parents and students outnumber the NRA.
3035 2018-03-03 10:05:55 Those companies did not disrespect NRA by taking away discounts. Those companies have/and show a moral conscious/responsibility to act in a moral manner to get gun issues/problems (e.g., bump stocks, AR-15) off the market. Get real Bill - stop the shit show here

3037 2018-03-03 10:02:50 Did trump just suggest banning all guns, raising the legal age limit, banning bump stocks and semi automatics I am so confused
3038 2018-03-03 10:01:57 Who cares about the debts of the banks, when banks are your enemies? Koreans need to break out of their complacency and be more outspoken, at least as preemptive measure in regard to the stocks. They (US, banks, S&L's) are pretty much on the same team, whereas others are not.

3040 2018-03-03 10:00:26 Winter Stock update - Calor Gas good stocks at Bourne and Deeping. Coal and Logs (pre-pack bags), and Kindling - some stocks at all 3 Branches. Bulk Bags of logs sold out but more due in next week.
3041 2018-03-03 09:57:46 May said we will have control of UK waters and we will control who can fish in those waters. Makes sense to grant licences to some EU boats if there is enough fish stocks for everyone. Priority given to UK fisherman obviously.
3042 2018-03-03 09:57:10 agree, too many stocks had/have price action that defied logical views, good news met with sells, bad news met with sells, no news met with sells, rolling block sell trades matching any buying etc. too consistent to be co incidence imo, and a practice copied by others currently ?
3043 2018-03-03 09:56:25 80% is possible. try high beta stocks :)
3044 2018-03-03 09:54:44 Me too. Needs to go a lot, lot lower for me though. I'm looking for total meltdown on stocks like this before I go in.
3045 2018-03-03 09:54:35 I donated on 28th January. Guessing you won't let me come again so soon. Am happy to help in Lincoln if you need stocks of B+
3046 2018-03-03 09:54:28 Only asked if more equipment would help, but considering some of the rubbish govt wastes money on, contingency snow equipment stocks are not a bad idea. We *used* to be able to cope with snow in UK, not now it seems.
3047 2018-03-03 09:52:07 And what about Gold Stocks?

3050 2018-03-03 09:49:09 Piss off bristow
3051 2018-03-03 09:48:58 This makes sense. It should work better with individual stocks.

I don't do much of #gammascalp trades so don't have objective data to support this. But in principle I agree.
3052 2018-03-03 09:48:41 I don’t really care about Billionaires feelings but I am worried about a large portion of investors selling their stocks when seeing significant decreases in the stock market thus potentially causing a crash and then a recession.
3053 2018-03-03 09:47:20 My opinion is this; I agree that rifles shouldn't be able to be purchased until the age of 21, but Bump Fire Stocks are not considered weapons, they are accessories that simulate full-auto fire but are not considered to convert a weapon to full-auto. @Emma4Change.
3054 2018-03-03 09:46:48 All in hindsight, most stocks in my portfolio have come back, I can also brag, but I know they are shitty stocks. When matters for beginner and what matters when you are expert , the whole environment becomes so toxic 
that it is hard to hold on to stocks when markets collapse.
3055 2018-03-03 09:43:59 Shouldn’t US steel and aluminium stocks be rising? Why would this guy dump it if he had insider information?
3056 2018-03-03 09:41:59 I don’t feel bad for the billionaires, but I am afraid to see investors selling off theirs stocks when they see decreases in the stock market thus potentially crashing the stock market again and causing a world wide recession.
3057 2018-03-03 09:39:14 Is it possible for a experienced #DayTrader to switch over and work for a major #financialinstitution? I’d like to make the switch if possible. #finance #career #stocks #Economic

3060 2018-03-03 09:36:28 That is false. They help train people to use guns wisely and protect themselves and their families. They also want background checks and are for banning bump stocks. Yes u might want to research before you mischaracterizw. You honestly don’t know what you’re talking about.
3061 2018-03-03 09:36:25 Flicking through Twitter quickly I keep misreading #StormEmma as Emma Stone: Emma Stone left her mark last night; Emma Stone's sting in the tail; Emma Stone live; Emma Stone Red Alert Extended; Emma Stone - have you got the stocks in?  etc
3062 2018-03-03 09:34:21 Yo he ido haciendo esa cartera con alguna más desde este miércoles y parece que le queda muuucho más recorrido . Lo que me ha sorprendido es la fortaleza de la cartera con el mercado tan revuelto que ha estado esta semana .
3063 2018-03-03 09:33:52 Hi Eric, the weather has caused some disruption to deliveries, but the Duty Manager tells me they have stocks of fresh produce. Thanks - Ian
3064 2018-03-03 09:33:12 I agree.But I am afraid that it will cause a panic in the stock market with prices significantly decreasing like this.Which will cause more people to want to sell their stocks before they think it is too late resulting in it decreasing even more and then causing another recession
3065 2018-03-03 09:31:00 Zvolili jsme nějaký parlament a prezidenta, ale to neznamená, že nebudou pracovat podle nastavených pravidel. Nezvolili jsme si žádnou šlechtu, ale správce.
3066 2018-03-03 09:30:09 Bump stocks were the issue
3067 2018-03-03 09:29:32 Promise, Gaming table will be the last one and ill start funding my stocks portfolio again.
3068 2018-03-03 09:29:26 You don't need bump stocks unless you want to kill a lot of people.
3069 2018-03-03 09:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3070 2018-03-03 09:28:07 A co se teď jako změní? Jen budete nadávat, co tu udělaly tradiční strany za 31 let a hledat dalšího spasitele. Babiš je král všech těch lumpáren po revoluci.
3071 2018-03-03 09:27:35 I overheard 2 staff talking in a supermarket yesterday over the empty shelves. They’re rationing milk & bread. What supplies can get through are being re-routed up to Scotland as their stocks are even lower than ours. Time to panic?!
3072 2018-03-03 09:27:00 What do you expect? If only retailers and sneaker boutiques actually start addressing this problem. A Ma Maniere did a great job for their consortium release and other boutiques should learn from them, unless all they care about is getting rid of stocks and not their customers.
3073 2018-03-03 09:26:53 I think it was due to investors selling back their stocks due to the new tariffs being proposed by the US government.
3074 2018-03-03 09:25:22 You’ll still win pal, we’re shite
3075 2018-03-03 09:25:11 @realDonaldTrump hey Donnie, is it just coincidence that Carl Icahn sold over $30 million in steel stocks just before you announced new tariffs? He managed to save over $6 million by doing so, he's a close friend and former advisor of yours isn't he?
3076 2018-03-03 09:25:03 No es como empieza sino como acaba. Grande Adolfo . Grande @VisionariosBols .
3077 2018-03-03 09:24:47 Neves will now miss the Leeds game, you jammy sods @adam_stocks_! 
3078 2018-03-03 09:24:43 The NRA just made clear that, love 'em or hate 'em, they are a very principled outfit. By opposing a ban on 'bump stocks,' along with a proposal to raise the buying age for AR-15's to 21, they are being true to their clarion-clear principle:Sell as many guns and ammo as possible.

3083 2018-03-03 09:20:14 Ok demokrate, musíte si stěžovat na toho, kdo napsal českou Ústavu! Bohužel permanentně generuje nestabilní vlády. Kolik vlád dokončilo řádné volební období? Zemanova a Sobotkova za 28 let tristní bilance co myslíte?
3084 2018-03-03 09:19:44 I would say the majority of coarse anglers are coservationists. Unfortunately certain imigrant groups have decimated stocks, especialy carp, in some areas!
3085 2018-03-03 09:19:32 And telling Carl Icahn in advance about his weird steel trade war. And Icahn dumped his steel stocks last week.
3086 2018-03-03 09:17:42 Definitely not the law that says a guy in Vegas can buy 30 rifles, 10k rounds, and several bump stocks in a fucking month with absolutely no method to understand or question why the fuck hes OBSESSED with and NEEDS.
3087 2018-03-03 09:17:05 Hope Kel Brooke gives him a choccy brownie tonight. Wilder to beat Ortiz inside 6 brada. Bradaaaa
3088 2018-03-03 09:16:58 P. Kabele, jestli mluvíte o svobodných parlamentních volbách, jako o převratu jste v jiné době :) Pokud jste si nevšiml světová ekonomika roste několik let, protože česká ekonomika je otevřená daří téměř všem. Podívejte na banky 3 banky téměř 40mil za rok.

3097 2018-03-03 09:11:11 Hello Tom wright here. Phone has been taken on first night so if you need me il be home on Tuesday night. I apologies for any inconvenience caused
3098 2018-03-03 09:10:39 Opening from 10am - 6pm hopefully and many trucks on road with deliveries but of course stocks will be low in some areas
3099 2018-03-03 09:10:11 Why they make you stop tweeting about stocks?
3100 2018-03-03 09:10:01 What are the others stocks in your portfolio !!! Curious

3102 2018-03-03 09:08:08 Stocks are not an economic indicator, only an emotional one.  Large swings are built on perception and not fact. When the actual analysis comes out on a plan you see that bubble burst like it is now. Getting rich making the rich feel richer but with no value to America.
3103 2018-03-03 09:07:58 “Shortly before Trump announced tariffs, his former adviser dumped millions in steel-related stocks”         Inside trading!??
3104 2018-03-03 09:06:43 One more question regarding stop loss at entry:
I would like to define a fixed % SL when entry on pullback againt sma50.
Any advice?
Or should I adapt this % SL to the stocks volatility?
I prefer a fixed value regardsless of stock to keep the system simple :-)
3105 2018-03-03 09:06:32 Yes you can have more than one ISA account but you can only pay current years allowance of £20,000 across one Cash, one Stocks and Shares, one Help to Buy and one Lifetime ISA in one tax year. If you have any further questions please let us know. Thanks Laura :)
3106 2018-03-03 09:04:54 Don't need any studies to tell me wild stocks don't go near land based aquaculture.
3107 2018-03-03 09:02:26 Hasn't India done same thing by imposing minimum import prices? Not only in steel & aluminium but other commodities as well? Metal stocks started doing well on higher prices. Consumer's cost artificially increased. Govt should think of ways to lower commodity production cost.
3108 2018-03-03 09:00:53 Aapl is one of a few stocks that both dumb/smart money is buying when all else fails. What do you want to own it now? Earn disappointed. Samsung cut glass production for smart phone dramatically. Smartphone shipments for everyone are down. Maybe the momentum is ending.

3110 2018-03-03 08:59:57 Pay for costs by issuing coins/tokens, people can trade them like stocks. Running the blockchain requires small fees paid in tokens. Almost zero cost to users.

At least I think that's how many blockchain programs work.

3121 2018-03-03 08:47:39 Icahn sold his shares on Feb.12, i.e. 2.5 weeks ahead of the report.

How long ago Icahn would have had to sell his stock not to be suspect of insider trading?
4, 6, 8 weeks? And/or how he could have avoided being accused insider insider trading? Declaring his stocks somehow?

3130 2018-03-03 08:39:06 Well Icahn long known for raiding companies and dumping stocks. But if hes now getting government help to do it? Really disgraceful. But GOP wont do anything about it. The country is just something to be sold off to line their pockets,

3133 2018-03-03 08:37:39 I pray that next time he comes unglued, he doesn't start a nuclear war instead of a trade war... but obviously people knew about it far enough in advance to dump their stocks. Starting to wonder how much is just his staff declaring ignorance to avoid blame!?
3134 2018-03-03 08:35:19 Not Trump and his co conspirators they sold their stocks! INSIDER TRADE VIOLATIONS!!
3135 2018-03-03 08:32:51 Fournier is correct though.  That rights arent based on need.  And bump stocks shouldnt be banned.

3137 2018-03-03 08:31:14 Cormerants have I think extended their range. I still 100% disagree with them. But they also target otters. OTTERS! They want otters off our rivers because, you'll be shocked, they eat fish! (The impacts of which on fish stocks of very debatable)
3138 2018-03-03 08:30:39 Company may not exist in 3-4 years, leave alone 10 years. My father had invested in 12-15 small cap stocks during 90s. All of them closed down in 6-8 years. Had he invested at least half the money in large cap, it would have yielded solid returns

3142 2018-03-03 08:27:44 But also fish stocks being hit by the triple whammy of cormorants, otters and the much bigger threat of signal cray fish does not get much attention.

3173 2018-03-03 08:06:47 The issue as it relates to insider trading is timing. Why are major investors with direct ties to Trump dumping steel and aluminum stocks a week before the surprise announcement? You believe they have some superhuman tea leaf reading abilities? Or did they just get tipped off?

3187 2018-03-03 08:01:05 good to know I, however see the need to limit magazine size, and ban bump stocks points to a particular fondness for the type of weapon most useful in the hunting down of humans

3197 2018-03-03 07:47:04 That money is mainly a prediction of future earnings of stocks, which just took a dive because Trump's tariff is not only horrible for US steel-using jobs, but indicative of his level of economic incompetence.
So nobody gained that money; a few bought cheaper stock than last week
3198 2018-03-03 07:43:02 No, the AR 15 was labeled an assault rifle and was a civilian weapon prior to being replicated for the military. Weapons designed for area targets, I agree, but those are illegal already, minus modifications like bump stocks.

3218 2018-03-03 07:13:17 They said the same thing about solar Canadian timber & washing machines and the stocks dropped at first too until they decided to build factories here instead of facing tariffs. The West CAN NOT allow China a communist dictatorship to control the entire steel market.

3222 2018-03-03 07:07:10 You don' think that big stock buybacks (which you compare to the "measly" $6 billion in bonuses to workers) go to the middle class?  Nearly all of whom have their retirement savings in stocks?  Hmmmm
3223 2018-03-03 07:06:35 @realDonaldTrump 
So you helped Icahn out or are you going to argue coincidence that he just happened to dump those stocks!
3224 2018-03-03 07:05:39 It’s OK to confess. When you heard Trump advocating for responsible gun control (expanded background checks, banning of bump stocks, closing loopholes like Gun Shows, expanded mental health checks) you were encouraged. Here he was before a bi-partisan Group challenging (1/2)
3225 2018-03-03 07:04:00 No the problem is gun shows where no background checks are done.  In addition, teenagers should not be able to buy guns, bump stocks should not be sold and mentally ill people should not be able to get guns.  All this should be done at a MINIMUM.
3226 2018-03-03 07:03:47 Yeah what are these good arguments for bump stocks I like to hear some.

3229 2018-03-03 07:02:24 o jakych nakladech se bavime?
jadro toho problemu je v tom, ze cnb naprosto selhala.
to, ze rezervy tak nabobtnali neni protoze byli expanzivni, ale protoze byli malo expanzivni. tim ze nic nedelali pred 2013 zvetsovali output gap i inflacni gap
3230 2018-03-03 07:02:24 Tariffs won't happen. Icahn dumped those stocks high and the market tanked. Farmers are angry and that's a lot of red votes. This will go away like #DACA and #GunReform. @realDonaldTrump will back away.
3231 2018-03-03 07:01:52 And if that other place cannot provide the same quantity and quality product. Also at most likely a higher price. That leaves you with shortages. And massive price inflation. Affects of dependent industry and overall stocks....you dingus
3232 2018-03-03 06:59:21 @sengraham2016 WTF
Are you a war profiteer?
What's wrong with you?   SERIOUSLY
Do you own shares or stocks in a war profiting company?
3233 2018-03-03 06:57:40 (contd) 2/2 Read the same book several times than many books 1 time. Invest in small bits and learn. Nothing can be achieved in a short time. Invest large amounts only after you acquire good skills. Be logical, avoid emotional traps. And avoid operator managed and junk stocks.
3234 2018-03-03 06:57:34 5/ So it never changed the function of the weapon. If you then ban bump stocks under the legal wording of "increasing the rate of fire" then nearly everything on the planet falls into that category because the rate of fire for semiautos is legally defined as 1 squeeze for 1 shot

3237 2018-03-03 06:54:02 If you are a new investor, avoid F&O. There are hundreds of books. Read only a few that are classics; many others are poor copies of the classics. I recommend to start with 3: Intelligent Investor, One Up on Wall Street and Common Stocks Uncommon Profits. Contd... 1/2
3238 2018-03-03 06:53:55 I wud measure total portfolio peak to peak....some good stocks and some bad. Ideally bad stock should not be lasting in pf at the next peak.
3239 2018-03-03 06:51:39 Yes ban bump stocks. It’s crazy tho that no one cares that dozens of children die everyday by handguns..bcus it’s not on tv I guess. Btw ARs aren’t used in the Chicago shootings. White children get all the attention, what a surprise
3240 2018-03-03 06:50:15 On a more serious note - i compare mkt peak to peak prices of stocks in my portfolio as an indicator of good/bad stocks. Eg. Hdfc bank was around 400 odd in jan 2008. So grew at 16%+ CAGR.
3241 2018-03-03 06:49:29 Depending on the stock for sure. Don't put yourself in that kind of position. Some of the stocks you've posted have had nasty gaps down. Look at $fl

3244 2018-03-03 06:47:11 1/ People are against bump stock legislation not because they really want bump stocks but because in order to write legislation on firearm parts you have to first define that part, like any good legal document. Firearms are such a simple device that it's next to impossible to
3245 2018-03-03 06:45:05 When I reach out of them with trust in oneplus brand the responses really inappropriate and  after fighting with them I get a response that it will be replaced after a week only irrespective of them having the stocks available in front.Isn't it really frustrating for a customer
3246 2018-03-03 06:41:46 Don't even care about the dude that supposedly had inside info and dumped steel stocks, just here to say Buffet is basically the devil but I also kind of love him. Dude acts so fuckin innocent and goes for the throat while no one is watching
3247 2018-03-03 06:40:46 Don’t make accusations show proof of wrong doing,he also dumped plenty of other company stocks too.Hillary turned a thousand dollars into something like hundreds of thousands on a trade
3248 2018-03-03 06:39:57 That is sure "watered down pee" compared to what the Congressmen and Congresswomen agreed to make such strong bill and Trump said he'd sign it!! NOTHING ABOUT RAISING AGE TO 21 AND BAN THE ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS!! COME ON RUBIO YOU TALKED TO THE KIDS! @SenatorRubio

3257 2018-03-03 06:32:03 Actually their stocks jumped after they chose to raise gun limit to 21. Are you under 21? If not, you’re not effected. But if under 18... there are other options.
3258 2018-03-03 06:28:50 Lock him up. He bought the Stocks with insider knowledge.
3259 2018-03-03 06:28:27 @realDonaldTrump should be now tried for #InsiderTrading. Something smells fishy about #CarlIcahn selling off his steel stocks.... Perhaps the #Russians tipped him off because they know of things first.

3261 2018-03-03 06:25:45 ano, mate pravdu, ale v dobe, kdy to zavadeli, nikdo necekal, ze ropa spadne ze 100 USD se vsemi dusledky na inflaci ... a pokud mam pocit, ze posilujici kurz nas uz nevrati do deflacni pasti, tak je to podle mne lepsi cesta nez nechat pred exitem inflaci vyrazne prestrelit

3264 2018-03-03 06:19:28 Peshmerga and Yazidi need the bump stocks in their training so they can replace American troops in rotation at Kabul Afghanistan ... Proverbs 2:22 , Acts 2:34 -35.... Prove ! In God We Trust !

3266 2018-03-03 06:16:09 I am absolutely for a discussion about what can be done. Ban bump stocks, sure. Better mental health programs, sure. But possibly banning a gun that is responsible for a fraction of the gun murders in America? People want something to blame and they are choosing the wrong thing
3267 2018-03-03 06:15:49 85% of all stocks are owned by millionaires. Your 401K is insignificantly effected by a buyout inflation bubble - because it is an artificial bubble.
3268 2018-03-03 06:14:16  He must’ve gotten insider information about Trumps plan, then decided to trade his stocks. What’s the term for this behavior? Is there one? I know, let’s call it INSIDER TRADING? That also sounds super illegal too.
3269 2018-03-03 06:13:47 I love stocks, I literally do nothing and triple my money
3270 2018-03-03 06:13:17 My state passed a law banning use of cell phones while driving. And we banned bump stocks. I'm hoping we'll ban assault weapons next. See, you can deal with more than one thing at a time!
3271 2018-03-03 06:10:58 The Federalist Papers is even more clear that a militia must be well-regulated, and doesn't specify the rights for everyone to own semi-automatics, automatics, bump stocks, 10,000 rounds etc.

3273 2018-03-03 06:00:49 and yet the white house staff came out and said the NRA was wrong and that trump still wants to ban bump stocks and make the age to buy guns 21. the NRA didnt change his mind at all
3274 2018-03-03 05:59:54 Somebody has got to pull the plug on this criminal WH  and prosecute this guy! Also don't forget that when this man dumped the stocks he voted on how he thinks trumps tariff move will effect American steel and our economy and it just isn't good, not for America not for the world!

3276 2018-03-03 05:58:01 In American, it is not illegal for politicians to be in power and own stocks. Since Trump tax cuts, take a peek at the stock buy backs from major corporations for their shareholders
3277 2018-03-03 05:57:19 Surely Trump’s tariffs intended to hit steel & aluminium companies’ share prices, making lots of money for his gangster friends that shorted those stocks when they were tipped off last week.
Or to hit those companies/countries because they didn’t give money to Jared.
3278 2018-03-03 05:56:57 You know you’re welcome to stay in Europe.  No need to “fix” our process outside of less soft targets, banning bump stocks and perhaps raising the age to purchase.  #NRA
3279 2018-03-03 05:56:51 Talk to your “friend” who ditched his steel stocks last week. Hope he gets the top bunk. Martha went, so will he. Oh, and you. LOCK YOU UP, LOCK YOU UP
3280 2018-03-03 05:56:44 That's a marketing strategy.. (2 stocks left) 
3281 2018-03-03 05:56:27 And bump stocks original design was to assist ppl with fine motor skills issues like say a vet who has lost his fingers.   But what sensible gun laws failed to do was issue a permit for a bump stock like a handicap parking permit.

3291 2018-03-03 05:51:17 A $B-Aire unload steel stocks for $31.2M a few days before the tariffs. Really cheap to do for Icahn which makes me wonder who else he told. This yhas to be checked out to see who else knew.

3293 2018-03-03 05:49:35 While some states and cities have banned bump stocks, the US Senate needs to step up and pass a national program so people in all states are protected.
3294 2018-03-03 05:49:09 I just read somewhere that Russians also dumped stocks.

Just more garbage can digging in hopes something can prove Trump right. Polls shows He's a racist even by own your liberal Republicans. He just crashed the Stocks 
3300 2018-03-03 05:45:56 I would really like to know why we can’t just stop the sales of any AR type guns to anyone under 21 but allow them to own shot guns or other “normal” hunting rifles under 21 yrs.? I mean you could buy you kid one for their bday and who’d know? Then don’t allow bump stocks under21
3301 2018-03-03 05:44:30 Isn’t it  all the above, plus? Systems repairs aren’t immediate. I see nothing wrong with banning tactical weapons & mods; short barrels, foldng stocks; internal & external full auto mods; hi-cap mags. Cops could legally get involved at mere sight. Likely to save lives.
3302 2018-03-03 05:44:05 Someone in the WH needs to admit WHO put the notion in Trump's head that tariffs should be EXACTLY 25%/10% on Steel/Alum imports. By all reports, his own staff were stunned and flabbergasted. Was it Icahn, so he could short steel stocks after he dumped his own shares? Who?!
3303 2018-03-03 05:43:35 It was planned out since his friend dumped stocks last week. So frustrating dealing with a grown mans temper tantrum.
3304 2018-03-03 05:43:04 Hey, how did your pal, Carl Icahn, know to dump his $31 million in steel stocks just days before your announcement on steel tariffs? Inquiring minds want to know.

3310 2018-03-03 05:41:55 Bad analogy, since hospitals treat drug addiction. NRA leadership has lobbied against all reasonable gun legislation like banning bump stocks & expanding background checks, which a lot of NRA members actually support.
3311 2018-03-03 05:41:45 Sorry dude, I'm not wrong, last time a machine gun was used in civilian hands was during the early 30's, Bonny & Clyde used a BAR, Capone and his crowd loved tommy guns.  They outlawed machine guns for these reasons in '34.
"Machine gun like"? Bump stocks will go, AR's not.

3314 2018-03-03 05:41:14 Tired of this argument. Most of these Mass shootings were done with guns the perpetrator BOUGHT. So, knock it off. Asking to raise the age to buy guns, banning bump stocks & assault weapons ISN'T TOO MUCH TO ASK. It common sense so I know it's over your head so just hush.

3334 2018-03-03 05:26:23 Florida had neither bump stocks nor fully automatic. In fact he had 10 round magazines and his gun frequently jammed until it locked up to the point he didn't know how to fix it. Number of rounds expended was quite small. He left over 150 rounds behind.

3338 2018-03-03 05:24:27 And whispering in the ears of their long-time buddies, apparently, too. Carl Icahn's dumping of steel stocks is just too timely to be coincidental.
3339 2018-03-03 05:23:44 Right the tariff thing was a solo call he made. He returned to the America first playbook. Billions have been lost in stocks as a result. I'm worried what happens when he doesn't get the praise he expects from the tariff change
3340 2018-03-03 05:23:20 burnol stocks run out. seems lot of people applying it ' liberally '.
3341 2018-03-03 05:22:22 Let's be honest, banning bump stocks actually helps future mass shooters. Bump stocks are horribly inefficient and inaccurate. Had the Vegas shooter aimed instead of spraying bullets he would been a far deadlier shooter. #nra
3342 2018-03-03 05:19:34 You got that right! They better not think that bump stocks is a foot into changing 2a they got another thing coming
3343 2018-03-03 05:18:19 I would like to know how much he made off of dumping stocks before announcing the new tariffs. For some reason I feel like Trump is in panic mode and is either trying to do as much damage as possible or is trying to get as much money as possible before the end.
3344 2018-03-03 05:15:00 worried baka madumihan stocks. 
3345 2018-03-03 05:14:04 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Age limit to 21
Universal background checks.

IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? 
CHILD OR ADULT?
THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
3346 2018-03-03 05:13:24 I’m kinda thinking all those #GOP *thoughts and prayers* are voodoo prayers in favor of gun violence. Cos the gun makers’ stocks go up with every gun-death. Let’s face it, Americans are worth more to #Republicans dead than alive.
3347 2018-03-03 05:12:36 Latin American stocks ended mixed on Friday, with some indexing clawing back narrow gains after earlier sinking broadly on concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to tack tariffs on to steel and aluminum imports.
3348 2018-03-03 05:11:55 You can't kid anyone that the Trump administration is functional anymore. The big win, temporary tax cuts & bonuses, will soon fade for most citizens. Plus, Trump's narcissism and senility are growing, to wit: he tanked stocks today because he was "itching for a fight."  Soon.
3349 2018-03-03 05:11:16 How do you trade stocks with just 30K shares volume?
3350 2018-03-03 05:10:34 Pretty sure where stocks closed would more worthy of an article? How about explain the reversal instead of the knee-jerk reaction?
3351 2018-03-03 05:10:17 No, he is not writing them out.  All this guy does is headfakes and behind the back passes.  Nothing will get done with bump stocks...or DACA...or the tarriff...just noisy pandering.
3352 2018-03-03 05:08:58 .@ElmoAlerts Stocks root readily under glass, I should like to ask your advice.

3355 2018-03-03 05:06:45 SEC should focus on insiders dumping major steel and aluminum stocks pre announcement. They did such a good job that back in  '08, right?
3356 2018-03-03 05:06:41 You first, tough guy!
3357 2018-03-03 05:05:17 I get some of my income from stocks, and I think that could account for the difference.  I've paid more before (and lots less too) so who knows.  What really bothers me is that now I have to prepare my US taxes!
3358 2018-03-03 05:05:16 Icahn is dumping his steel related stocks??  
3359 2018-03-03 05:04:26 Congressman can buy or sell stocks with Insider information and it's not against the law

3360 2018-03-03 05:03:52 #boomietrader what's your feel this March on stocks? What is your watchlist?
3361 2018-03-03 05:03:42 What’s a right?  I see nothing in the Constitution mentioning bump stocks or AR-15s. I do see mention of guns being allowed for militia members. Want an AR-15? Join the milit[ia]ary.
3362 2018-03-03 05:02:28 When are you going to establish some consistency in your policies, You are all over the place,  One day you support bans on bump stocks, taking guns away from those who pose a threat, and tighter background checks and the next day you do not. You are too chaotic.

3366 2018-03-03 05:00:40 It’s barely a start Rubio. You are going to have to have strong background checks, no sales to under 21, no assault rifles, no bump stocks, and add a nat’l buyback.
3367 2018-03-03 05:00:22 This is not financial advise, but you could go into day trading/swing trading with stocks.  I try to do 2-3 winning swing trades a month, and it's been positive for me.  Made off with handsome profits with NVAX on 3/1 at 8:31 AM.
3368 2018-03-03 04:59:33 We all disagree on certain issues in the realm on the 2nd amendment. I’ve heard good arguments on the side of keeping bump stocks
3369 2018-03-03 04:59:03 Clapped in stocks is going a bit too far, dontchya think?
3370 2018-03-03 04:58:55 Traders r speculators. I never understood why traders shud make money in stocks. Stocks are owning part of business which takes efforts n patience to build. Traders piggyback on this and look for quick buck. Why shud they thrive?
3371 2018-03-03 04:57:34 Totally remember that. All have still not been recovered. My point was that left are screaming about bump stocks & automatic assault rifles when Obama is the one who legalized bump stocks &, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought automatic assault rifles were banned in the 90s
3372 2018-03-03 04:56:03 if he hadnt sold, he would have made a fortune;  hes an expert -- how would he not know that  protecting alum and steel tariff announcement would benefit the steel industryand sent his stocks gaining value
3373 2018-03-03 04:53:24 % background checks on every sale. (No inherited) Include mental health, see Oregon’s Boyfriend Bill. Longer waits, raise age above 21. Limit ARs & semiautomatics, any modifier, high capacity mags, bump stocks. Welcome ideas/comprises.

3376 2018-03-03 04:50:59 Probably got a $5 million taxpayer grant for this “scholarship.”  Why did we stop public shaming of fools with ridicule and ripe fruit while locked in the stocks in the marketplace?
3377 2018-03-03 04:50:53 Stocks are gonna crash soon and we’re entering a pointless trade war which we will lose. Trump’s admin will crash the US and the free market system will (incorrectly) be blamed for the crash. Ppl like you will by why capitalism will be blamed... so stupid.
3378 2018-03-03 04:50:08 I think as regulation rises, lending will be treat similar to a liquidity access line with stocks - to avoid taxable events
3379 2018-03-03 04:48:18 Please someone check where what stocks he owns? This doesn't come from nowhere. It definitely effects @realDonaldTrump bottom line.

3381 2018-03-03 04:47:36 trump's friend and business buddy Carl Icahn dumped millions in Steel stocks a week before Trump announced the tariffs on steel. Insider knowledge? Seems to me someone may want to look into this.
3382 2018-03-03 04:47:35 I am horrified for what they went thru. I really am. But there is a way to get your point across. Most of these kids are belligerent and doing more harm for their cause than good. Believe me. NRA membership is up and the stocks of the companies who sided with them are way down.
3383 2018-03-03 04:47:31 #boomietrader Hi Sir.  What’s the best solution/s with my stocks in red?
3384 2018-03-03 04:47:16 NEW STOCKS FOR UNOFFICIAL ITEMS! WE WILL POST THEM BY TOMORROW!

3385 2018-03-03 04:46:30 india just exports 2% of its production, increase in import duty will help domestic producers increase their prices, so it may help steel stocks in the short term but long term negative as it will lead to inflation and less consumption.
3386 2018-03-03 04:44:33 For who? Economy is up, stocks are up, unemployment is down,Crime is down..
3387 2018-03-03 04:44:07 Life NRA member & law enforcement officer, here is how I c it: ban AR's/high-cap mags, no, will do nothing; raise long-gun age to 21-ok w/ it, exemption for military/police; ban bump stocks, sure most have never heard of or used; universal background checks, yes, time has come.
3388 2018-03-03 04:43:26 Thank you college economics class. Stocks, on a roller coaster as of late and the only people making money are the 1% and the insiders.  BTW I am a registered republican and at least I can admit my mistakes. Take off the rose glasses.
3389 2018-03-03 04:42:56 "trump needs to do what he said he was gonna do" oh glad to see you are in favor of raising the age to purchase a long gun to 21, having stronger background checks, and outlawing bump stocks? Remember daddy said so.
3390 2018-03-03 04:39:58 Probably trying not to draw attention to Carl Icahn selling off his steel stocks.

3391 2018-03-03 04:38:01 Universal background checks, limiting high capacity mags? Banning bump-stocks?Your right to bear arms does not mean that every firearm is a legal one. No one is trying to ban all firearms.

3393 2018-03-03 04:36:31 @JoeNBC So it looks like old buddy Carl Icahn sold a ton of steel stocks short before trumps tarrif action and safed alot of his money..good prediction of donalds plans * cough* *cough*.
3394 2018-03-03 04:36:15 -Background checks for all, 5day quiet period & YLY renewal of registrations. Same as owning & driving a CAR which is NOT intended to KILL.
-Ban Bump Stocks, Ban all "Automatic Firearms"
-A process to OWN those Banned arms with proper oversight, recording, & monitoring.
3395 2018-03-03 04:36:01 Sounds like you're buying into the NRA's "slippery slope" theory: "First they take our bump stocks, then they take our AR-15s, eventually, we'll be left with only slingshots." Doesn't make much sense, given that we have a 2nd Amendment.

3398 2018-03-03 04:34:51 Carl Icahn has a person in the White House that must give him information. He unloaded millions in steel stocks just before Trump announcing new tariffs on steel saving him millions in the stock market losses. Thanks Trump you made his day.

3400 2018-03-03 04:34:12 Don't worry a lot of stocks sold before announcement made
3401 2018-03-03 04:34:02 For my long positions, I sell calls aggressively. If markets continue to trade lower, then pocket all the call money and roll over the positions.
If stocks, then go long in Cash market, so no problem of rollover.
3402 2018-03-03 04:33:29 It’s already illegal to modify any semi-auto into a fully-automatic weapon, whether it’s a rifle or a pistol. Bump stocks aren’t illegal (yet) because a rifle with one is still semi-auto, just made to simulate fully auto.
3403 2018-03-03 04:32:15 not good enough.

BAN BUMP STOCKS.
3404 2018-03-03 04:31:42 Living in the past future now: “Due to market risk, you can’t trade certain securities, including cryptocurrency, cannabis and penny stocks, … until your ACH transfer clears”.
3405 2018-03-03 04:31:35 Markets are down 7 to 8%.
Many good stocks are down by 10 to 20%.
Economic indicators are showing positive signals.
We are the victim of global jitters and banking scams.
Six months down the lane, things will look different.
3406 2018-03-03 04:29:55 Looking for ppl to be held accountable?  Look no further than Trumps former adviser dumping steel stocks right before Trump announced tariffs.
3407 2018-03-03 04:29:53 Thank you for this support for Hoosiers in need.  Let’s also figure out bipartisan legislation to require background checks for all gun purchases, fund research on gun violence & ban bump stocks and automatic weapons.
3408 2018-03-03 04:29:34 If the 'curbs are in effect' on Wall Street how do I get my stocks out of the gutter?
3409 2018-03-03 04:29:14 Katie,  I'm a huge gun owner and I own many firearms including the ar.  Bump stocks should go.
3410 2018-03-03 04:24:57 Guess who invested in solar company stocks a week before Trumpty announced tariffs???  Guess who sold them today at a $5K loss?? I made that $5K under Obama and lost it with the "brilliant businessman".
3411 2018-03-03 04:22:49 Let's see what they do with the money they have no choice but put it back into the system, banks, stocks, bonds, funds. So the money becomes available to other companies and individuals to use.
The best investment is research and development.
3412 2018-03-03 04:22:43 Bump stocks should be illegal I just watched a YouTube video of some dude using one that shit was ji OD
3413 2018-03-03 04:22:43 I need to learn more about stocks and bonds
3414 2018-03-03 04:22:26 A general observation - when "value unlocking" is done, most of the times it much more beneficial to put all the money into the "children" stocks after the split. Good thing to keep at the back of the mind, in my opinion.
3415 2018-03-03 04:22:23 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You stated on live TV that, per your direction to AG, bump stocks were gone, that you supported raising age limit to buy long guns to 21, & you would support Toomy/Cornyn enhanced background check bills.Are you a man of your word or are you scared of NRA?
3416 2018-03-03 04:21:52 Redmi Note 5 Pro in stocks.... & Mi Notebook, Security Cameras

3417 2018-03-03 04:21:17 Meaningful change. 100% of sales have thorough background checks. Federal access to records. Longer wait periods, raise ages, see Oregon’s Boyfriend Bill. Limit ARs & semiautomatics, large capacity mags, any modifiers, bump stocks. No inherited firearms. All ideas welcome.
3418 2018-03-03 04:20:28 "You're being performative!" Or...maybe they just had a question and are new to activism and are still working out what's ok to say and what not to???  Maybe people don't need to get put in the stocks for a mistake, but what do I know.
3419 2018-03-03 04:20:16 Your stocks not doing that well after this decision...
3420 2018-03-03 04:19:45 @SenSherrodBrown @senrobportman @RepSteveChabot We need gun control now. Can we at least all agree to ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks and close background check loopholes?
3421 2018-03-03 04:18:08 Why sell now?... if tariffs are imposed, his steel related stocks would go sky high... Tariffs have not been imposed, and for all we know, Trump could be blowing smoke...
3422 2018-03-03 04:18:06 Man my stocks took a huge drop but back up now
3423 2018-03-03 04:17:46 They should at least get rid of bump stocks on their sauce dispensers.

3437 2018-03-03 04:09:00 ha, I've got mass media so somewhat independent of trade goods for the moment. Certainly keeping my aluminum stocks to myself.
3438 2018-03-03 04:08:13 Watch mining stocks go through the roof.
3439 2018-03-03 04:08:01 Used bump stocks. An easy conversion of a semi-auto rifle to almost automatic fire. Not quite as high a firing rate but close enough.
3440 2018-03-03 04:07:39 Lucky how?... if tariffs are imposed, his steel related stocks would go sky high... Tariffs have not been imposed, and for all we know, Trump could be blowing smoke... for now...

3443 2018-03-03 04:07:05 The US stocks rose overnight on expectations that Trump's tariffs on steel / aluminium would be less onerous compared to previous expectations.
3444 2018-03-03 04:06:36 Arming teachers to sell more guns? O know, you guys and your gun ban talk is what is selling the guns, thats what sells guns. Arming teachers is a drop in the bucket compared to gun ban talk. Look at the bump stocks, the website keeps crashing from overload.
3445 2018-03-03 04:06:35 Only if they sold their stocks. And they didn't.
3446 2018-03-03 04:03:17 There will always be plenty of stocks to choose from.

3448 2018-03-03 04:02:25 When do u expect the stock market to really collapse? I saw ur company is proping up stocks like apple w billions. U polly didn't want ur precious stock market to crash & burn.  No doubt plenty of money has be created to prop up stock market, but it's inevitable crash!
3449 2018-03-03 04:01:53 It's true they can and the market will treat them accordingly. That is why Delta lost millions in customer loss, and lost $30 million on tax breaks and Fed Ex stocks went up $640 million dollars, because they didn't cave to liberal bullies and dump the NRA.

3455 2018-03-03 03:59:46 rifles and shotguns do that job very well.

3461 2018-03-03 03:54:54 After undermining BATFE for years, supporting bump stocks and other guns/products facially designed to sidestep NFA; how can we accept #NRA as a sound voice on gun policy? Seems #NRA has done OWNERS a disservice by being so focused on "industry partners." #imamember
3462 2018-03-03 03:54:16 Have you ever considered making a set of stocks for an AR-10?

I have one under construction.
3463 2018-03-03 03:53:52 If you agree bump stocks should be banned then you also have to agree the AR15 should be banned. One does not need a bump stock to ratchet up the feed. All one  needs to do is hold the weapon away from your body. You get the same action.
3464 2018-03-03 03:53:52 All of his pals dumped all their stocks in American steel and aluminum dependent companies before he made public the tariffs he planned. A whole lot of insider trading going on. Making the rich richer that’s all his platform is all about.
3465 2018-03-03 03:52:49 So stupid. They’re pronounced plump stocks and R2-D2’s.
3466 2018-03-03 03:51:07 And bump stocks are not. What would be your point? This appears to be a bump.
3467 2018-03-03 03:50:43 I support Trump and tariffs on imported goods, without which we cannot compete with goods Made in America. Let the globalist stocks fall.
3468 2018-03-03 03:50:01 We made a friend named Tom at the bar who’s teaching us about stocks. I’M READY TO INVEST! 
3469 2018-03-03 03:48:57 All of the auto stocks are insanely cheap. It's the same thing with Magna up here.
3470 2018-03-03 03:47:07 @tedlieu Is there a way to find out how many Trump donors profited from the spike in steel stocks from the proposed tariffs, like they profited from the rest of his tweets and outdated policies?  Are tweets considered insider trading?
3471 2018-03-03 03:46:34 Hi Sharon! Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Surely, this isn't the kind of experience we want you to have with us. Due to overwhelming demand for our Avon products, our logistics team is doing their best to deliver stocks across all Avon branches as soon as possible.
3472 2018-03-03 03:46:26 They have argyle stocks.
3473 2018-03-03 03:44:34 How about banning AR-15s and other military style guns? How about banning bump stocks and large capacity magazines? I don't see these on your list.
3474 2018-03-03 03:44:28 How to get @realDonaldTrump & the @GOP to implement gun control. 
1)Have @Kaepernick7 buy all semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. 
2)Make @Kaepernick7 head of the NRA! 

That should do it.
3475 2018-03-03 03:43:53 $KO Acting better. A rising 10yr next week will be a crucial test. Bond proxy stocks may be under pressure for potentially years. $SPY
3476 2018-03-03 03:42:53 not really.  it was a scam that he and ichan cooked up..check it out..ichan bought steel stocks just last week
3477 2018-03-03 03:42:07 I am totally against Teachers having guns. We need less guns period and ban Assault Weapons, lg Magazines, Bum Stocks, etc.
3478 2018-03-03 03:41:52 Oh for Pete's sake, he didn't sell steel stocks. He sold stocks of a crane company.
3479 2018-03-03 03:41:06 Followed your $bidu puts all day. Can you help understand your strategy? Longer term bear based on tariffs? Bear on Chinese stocks? Thanks!
3480 2018-03-03 03:41:02 If he said he was going to do it during the campaign than he will. Stock tips - buy. Infrastructure stocks now, that is coming soon. Buy defense stocks because they are going to get business too. Sell drug stocks because they will come under pressure. It not hard to see this.
3481 2018-03-03 03:40:19 I don’t have any followers on here since I use this just for stocks info. Lol.   But please.  Though shall not discriminate on the amount of followers thou have.  Haha.    PLEASE PICK ME. lol.
3482 2018-03-03 03:39:39 My favorite line of #TheBigShort was ”Short the bank stocks and wait."

Second favorite? ”Very calmly, very politely, tell the risk assessors to fuck off."
3483 2018-03-03 03:39:13 Good. And they can blame Trump for manipulating the market with his tariff talk. Basically just a favor to his friend Carl Icahn. Wonder how soon he'll buy back stocks he dumped 2 weeks ago..at that new, better, lower price.
3484 2018-03-03 03:38:37 Isn't that what Martha Stewart went to jail for? A little birdie told her info,  she sold the stocks & was charged with insider trading. I could be wrong.
3485 2018-03-03 03:36:59 The only stocks that i have kept were $PAGS and $ZGNX
3486 2018-03-03 03:36:14 @realDonaldTrump Your buddy Icahn was just prescient, huh, Donny?  Coincident sell off of steel stocks, hours before your ridiculously backward and dangerous steel tariff announcement, right?  Insider trading?  You belong in prison.
3487 2018-03-03 03:35:08 Yup, there are a lot of CEO's that make an obscene amount of money, no doubt... but it's a corporation, selling to the public just like, say, Yahoo, Inc. Where Terry Semel makes $230mil a year in cash and mostly stocks. Does he seem worth it? Prolly not.
CEO pay is a separate Q?
3488 2018-03-03 03:34:38 Putting @LindseyGrahamSC in the stocks and having tomatoes and rocks thrown at him would be worth it in both the short and long runs.
3489 2018-03-03 03:33:15 My ex, who was a violent alcoholic and drug addict passed the personality test to be a guard at a nuclear power plant.  Just ban assault rifles, limit ammo clips, ban bump stocks, raise age limit to own a gun to 21, and if you can’t manage your own life, you can’t own Any weapon
3490 2018-03-03 03:32:47 My hunch is $SNAP is going to be a winner.  Hedge funds are going to need s play this year $FANG stocks are all over priced $SPY
3491 2018-03-03 03:32:45 @realDonaldTrump let’s raise tariffs on steel and aluminum 

Journalists- let’s look at steel stocks and a find a seller related to Trump - ahh there he is. 

You can’t make this stuff up.
3492 2018-03-03 03:30:22 I come from a very large farming community and these types of things are definitely not acceptable around here. The Amish know how to handle!!!  God Bless
3493 2018-03-03 03:30:20 When your new job tells you that along with your base pay salary you will also receive paid healthcare, 30k in company stocks, taxes paid, quarterly bonuses, ability to make your schedule, paid travel and any trainings! #winning #boss
3494 2018-03-03 03:30:03 Short Hindalco,Vedanta and steel stocks and maje money. I prefer shorting call options over stocks.
3495 2018-03-03 03:29:11 It was to help his friends who wanted to sell their steel & aluminum stocks!
3496 2018-03-03 03:29:03 Intrafish , that another subsidiary of a Norwegian behemoth trying to destroy   BC salmon stocks ?
3497 2018-03-03 03:28:34 Yes, the economy was bad then. I need to study the history of '70s. There was a recession in 1974-5, stocks went down a lot. Then high interest rates and inflation. OPEC cut back on oil and gas prices were high. And we realized we were trashing the earth. Not great times.
3498 2018-03-03 03:27:54 @SEC_News Are you investigating Carl Icahn for possible insider trading. He sold off millions in steel stocks right before Trump made his trade announcement and the market plunged.
3499 2018-03-03 03:27:15 Delta stocks dropped $2 Friday!
3500 2018-03-03 03:26:02 it most certainly will, and I definitely agree with those points, but they’re going to put this all on “crazy ppl” and “thugs” and “violent media,” and everything but the actual problems (assault weapons, bump stocks, gun show deregulation) bc they gotta make more money
3501 2018-03-03 03:25:55 congress heading for huge moral victory, sale of burnol shots up, stocks running out, hurry presstitutes.
3502 2018-03-03 03:24:41 Ban bump stocks, automatic guns, require background checks, no interstate travel with concealed weapons. Now.
3503 2018-03-03 03:23:22 No, he had input. Guess who dumped their steel stocks last week?
3504 2018-03-03 03:23:04 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!
3505 2018-03-03 03:23:00 Can't help but notice that FN's BAR pistol grip stocks look a lot like a certain Belgian battle rifle's stock.
3506 2018-03-03 03:22:27 Delta stocks dropped $2 Friday!!
3507 2018-03-03 03:22:08 Press needs to get this out with high emphasis so more people can understand the law is definitely being broken by DT. TV evening news is so bad, with so much fluff added instead of more important news. Such as DT's friend selling off steel-related stocks before tariffs announced
3508 2018-03-03 03:20:48 Serious question. Usually insider trading is getting info before anyone else can ans use it to trade your stocks. But trump doesnt think for himself, so there is a good chance he made his decisions after this guy told him to, in which case is it still insider trading?
3509 2018-03-03 03:20:44 ...Bump stocks, which were a $30, $40 piece, and languishing in shelves, were snapped up by buyers and resold at $400-$500.

3511 2018-03-03 03:19:19 I joined back when the NRA advocated keeping guns from criminals, mentally ill, domestic offenders.  
They don't do that any more, because MORE GUN sales=more NRA money.And whenever there's a shooting, they make bank. They yell "they're going to ban your ___!" In Oct, bump stocks
3512 2018-03-03 03:19:05 They knew. They didn't care. They ignore facts for a good story. The hype train moves stocks, data be damned.
3513 2018-03-03 03:18:50 Hope one of you guys ask him what he did with any relevant stocks he owned, before Trumps big announcement....
3514 2018-03-03 03:17:47 Did you read the article? It says banning bump stocks, and locking guns up safely and a few other things. It says nothing about taking away guns we legally own or changing the second amendment.
3515 2018-03-03 03:16:10 Aussie based Lithium Stocks will continue to turn into fantastic EV plays, the Chinese will do all the work in the Congo. AVZ

3517 2018-03-03 03:15:32 Lemme guess? Stocks, ideas, and interest rates? I had to hit at least one.
3518 2018-03-03 03:14:45 31million in Steel based stocks sold days before the Tariffs went in place by one of Trumps buddies  something doesnt seem right here.
3519 2018-03-03 03:14:31 I’ve been making money in the stock market like crazy so what do you mean the stocks have crashed, that’s a bold faced lie!  Gas prices are where they’ve always been, groceries are on the rise, they were on the rise during Obama!  Inflation not anymore than past years. What’s
3520 2018-03-03 03:13:43 Apparently saying we should do away with due process (very dumb) in relation to firearms, ban bump stocks, being open to banning some guns, accusing congressmen of being scared of NRA, and no national concealed concealed carry means that Trump is cowering in fear of the NRA.
3521 2018-03-03 03:13:09 Don't forget Oleg Deripaska. He pocketed a mint by selling his aluminum stocks.
3522 2018-03-03 03:11:53 I love how your picture is so big. You would not be using this tragedy for your own benefit would you? Saw your plan and wasn't impressed. 

How about raise the age, ban bump stocks, universal background, wait period and best of all, "Ban the AR15 and all similar semis"?
3523 2018-03-03 03:11:48 "Thoughts and prayers" while they buy their stocks back on the cheap.
3524 2018-03-03 03:11:30 FedEx stocks way up!  No one is listening!
3525 2018-03-03 03:10:57 Oh same person who turned recession around had stocks tripled unemployment on its way down bigger tax cuts than fake 45 all facts. Your insults are weak boy
3526 2018-03-03 03:10:44 How can you constitutionally justify AR-15s but not bump stocks?
3527 2018-03-03 03:10:15 Sick of talking about fucking stocks
3528 2018-03-03 03:08:52 What they fail to say is big corporations are buying back their own stocks. This drives up the share cost. Once that is done, stocks will correct themselves.
3529 2018-03-03 03:08:33 Ook is way undervalued. One of the best values stocks on asx right now
3530 2018-03-03 03:08:27 Agreed - bump stocks should be banned.
3531 2018-03-03 03:07:08 5 million NRA members dictating gun policy for a nation of over 320 million. Something seems wrong about that. The NRA is totally wrong on their love for Assault type weapons that are easily made automatic fire with devices like Bump Stocks that sell for less than $200 on line.
3532 2018-03-03 03:05:34 Me: maybe I should start investing in stocks. 
Also me: Man, money is tight. Fuck it, I’m ordering 4 pizzas, getting a six pack and renting a movie.
3533 2018-03-03 03:04:34 For such a fine old fashioned gent such as Roy Moore, I think a few days (or weeks) in the stocks to pay off his debts would work.
3534 2018-03-03 03:03:56 Any of y’all own any stocks?
3535 2018-03-03 03:03:33 "They’re also not meant to replace traditional currencies or investments like stocks." ? This guy is NOT a friend of the vision of #BITCOIN. He is one of THEM .Im Sorry after listening to him confess  it's not a way to replace fiat currency , and it's not something to invest in?
3536 2018-03-03 03:03:32 Bump stocks - agreed
Extended background checks- agreed
3 day waiting period - agreed
Assualt weapon ban-  negative
3537 2018-03-03 03:01:23 I'd sell off my stocks, buy and melt down an entire palette of Old Spice to bathe in for a slice of your pie, sweet lips 
3538 2018-03-03 03:01:05 Let’s see what stocks, puts and calls Wilbur bought or sold in February!
3539 2018-03-03 03:00:52 Ok here goes...gun control (background checks, limiting the size of clips, banning Assault style rifles, banning bump stocks) will not prevent you from getting or owning a gun for protecting yourself. It will reduce the # of incredibly lethal guns getting into the wrong hands.
3540 2018-03-03 03:00:44 Close friends of Trump managed to ditch stocks before hmm..
3541 2018-03-03 03:00:28 $NFLX Certainly a confidence builder today for longs that are holding other stocks also.
3542 2018-03-03 03:00:06 @NicolleDWallace @maddow @PhilipRucker @JRubinBlogger 2/ Oh and then there is Icahn. Dumping steel stocks just days before trade tariffs announced. No insider trading there. Just another coincidence, right? 
3543 2018-03-03 02:59:59 They lost nothing. It's just that some other stocks get pricier!
3544 2018-03-03 02:59:34 Well that was a nice shot little man. I'm actually a senior p.m. with on the top 5 contractors. I just don't sit on my ass all day and trade stocks. I have a guy for that that's why I'm out in the real world. Trade helps your industry only
3545 2018-03-03 02:59:09 Nowadays Quality stocks has become Relative term. Feb quality stock is march Junk.
3546 2018-03-03 02:58:25 Sir I have been following your advice and recommendations since 2012 (all about stocks on ET now ), great advice and recommendations.looking forward  for your recommendations.
3547 2018-03-03 02:57:15 I would like to adress the beast from the east to distance itself with and stop insulting the east. We are proud to be fully functional at -20 degrees in sarajevo with everything working and full stocks of food XD. Its more like a fart from the start. XD
3548 2018-03-03 02:56:36 What's worse than knowing your library stocks an anthology of TERF essays that includes outright lies about trans women?

Seeing it featured in the International Women's Day display.

I think it was done from ignorance, not malice, but that's pretty weak comfort.
3549 2018-03-03 02:56:21 Well said, Chris :-)  And to be quite honest, I'm surprised that bump stocks are still a thing.
3550 2018-03-03 02:56:10 buy stocks but someone
3551 2018-03-03 02:56:04 If I'm not mistaken the Virginia Tech shooter also had mental instability that was well-documented now I'm not sure if he had a modified bullet stocks but he should have never been allowed to have a gun
3552 2018-03-03 02:55:17 Enabling to the max! Why stop there?  Buy it for them too!  freaking idiots!!.. Start making the dealers responsible..lock them in stocks so us parents can deal with them..if my kid dies and i know who sold it to her..I want charges of man slaughter on him!
3553 2018-03-03 02:55:01 I'm the same in opinion, though I disagree about the AR-15. Without a bump stock it fires the same as many other rifles. There should be no bump stocks... I don't believe the guns are the problem, but people and our inability to root out the bad ones.
3554 2018-03-03 02:53:23 Hey Brent, I don't know if this USD short squeeze will happen soon or after other currencies and possibly gold break out of their patterns.  What I do know is we're due for consolidation in USD and UST and commodities will likely outperform stocks LT.
3555 2018-03-03 02:51:49 are you also changing age of military recruitment to 21? how about synthetic stocks they appear assaulting, extendable or short stocks would be more convenient in an invasion situation. mental health issues for a lot of folks can be dealt with more effectively on a gun range.
3556 2018-03-03 02:51:30 people arent. stocks tanking, massive uninstalls
3557 2018-03-03 02:50:13 Mr President Sir, with all due respect, bump stocks nor that kids age murdered those people! The complete lack of protection at the school and the outright refusal of the FBI and those sheriffs to do their jobs, that is why those kids and teachers are dead! #ARM OUR TEACHERS NOW
3558 2018-03-03 02:50:00 Ah, now, take pity on the afflicted!  Poor oul' What's-His-Face has finally succumbed to Dementia. Sure he can't remember a feckin' thing he told the Bipartisan meeting the other day about bump stocks and grabbing guns before the paperwork arrives.  Poor bugger. #TrumpRussia
3559 2018-03-03 02:49:57 Well, the bull run continued for more than 15 months. The downfall has just begun after the budget. If you are into quality stocks, you should hold and watch the action
3560 2018-03-03 02:47:24 Yes they're bill is to ban semi-automatic automatic weapons like the one that was used in these last previous shootings no Democratic talking about banning handguns or semi-automatic handguns there are talking about banning bump stocks which the president supports
3561 2018-03-03 02:47:21 It's hedges against the gains that were made in stocks that went up! ;-)
3562 2018-03-03 02:45:38 @younginvestor323 @stocks_geek this is the poster child of irrational exuberance lol.
3563 2018-03-03 02:45:14 But I’m no financial expert; I’ve always wanted to take courses in stocks and investments, stuff like that. You’re lucky you can get it for free in NY 
3564 2018-03-03 02:45:14 @younginvestor323 @stocks_geek u folks serious!?  Never heard of mrkts can remain irrational longer than u can stay solvent?
3565 2018-03-03 02:44:26 Forget bump stocks, bump cocks
3566 2018-03-03 02:44:16 We need to do something about them for sure, getting rid of ALL weapons that would be in the same class as an AR-15 is a start as well as bump stocks and anything that can fire more than 10 rounds without having to reload.
3567 2018-03-03 02:43:19 You do know that the reason many of these people have AR-15s (and they all have bump stocks) is because they are prepared to fight ANYONE who tries to take their guns.  You pass a law saying 'turn in your ARs' and they will all become criminals.
3568 2018-03-03 02:43:02 I still use my Bell helmet, giro shoes and camelback bottle.  I’m a product targeted purchaser. When I need a new one, or looking for replacements I’ll do as I normally do. Buy it online from the cheapest retailer that stocks it.
3569 2018-03-03 02:41:19 His media coy is over valued. His net worth is based on stocks and bonds. Trump’s own is solid equity
3570 2018-03-03 02:40:20 it is the same BS every qtr.  Does no good to give poor co's/mgt's the benefit of doubt. You will see little growth and big GAAP loss. Those are the facts. You can pretend if you wish (your right) but that doesn't make stock go up. Stocks get $2 or $3 price for a reason.
3571 2018-03-03 02:39:57 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3572 2018-03-03 02:38:47 Lol...no likes on this one. I still have just a quarter position and thought about adding when it held 13.95 a 2nd time. But there r so many other good stocks out there, I resisted.
3573 2018-03-03 02:37:12 Probably manipulating the market by spewing out Bullshit attacks against allies and industries for him / family to buy stocks at lowered prices.
3574 2018-03-03 02:36:30 niggas invest in stocks as soon as their beard connects im tired
3575 2018-03-03 02:36:06 You should go start investing in stocks then with that third eye lol
3576 2018-03-03 02:35:59 That's because his buddy Carl Icahn had time to sell his steel-dependent stocks, so it was ok to do the tariffs...
3577 2018-03-03 02:34:43 Trump's friend who sold mega amount of stocks last week before Trump's announcement
3578 2018-03-03 02:34:34 No.. they've been hottest DOW stocks. Need to enter a consol phase here. $BA - 35 pts came off in 3 days with some speculative headlines. Shows how vulnerable it is despite being the leader
3579 2018-03-03 02:33:40 So your patriotism is limited to your own money — specifically, your 401k from a short-term perspective. Did you check your stocks today?
3580 2018-03-03 02:33:40 Grant they aren’t assault weapons. They are rifles made to look like military weapons. No store sold true assault weapons. It’s the big ugly plastic or polymer accessories. I don’t think bump stocks are needed.

3583 2018-03-03 02:32:26 I’m sad I keep missing these re stocks I need a 2nd pair
3584 2018-03-03 02:32:04 Carl Icahn happened to sell $31 Million worth of stocks in companies that will be adversely affected by the steel tariffs just before Trump announced them.   That really stinks to high heaven.
3585 2018-03-03 02:31:58 So, you’ll put aside $3.3 million, and eliminate private ownership of military-style artillery and stocks??? If not, you’re not even close to even incremental progress.
3586 2018-03-03 02:31:51 ‘The stocks are doing so well, greatest in history, all hail Donald Trump’
3587 2018-03-03 02:30:26 Wow, comprehensive list of things that can mess up an investment! But you are correct. Lots of intuition involved when picking the right stocks, as well as lots of due diligence.
3588 2018-03-03 02:30:24 US steel stocks rallied after the announcement!! He should have waited
3589 2018-03-03 02:29:19 Something has to be done since the clowns in Washington have been screwing it up, before bill Clinton. Stocks will fall, returning the love should change things for the better.
3590 2018-03-03 02:28:44 In fact, there are vaccines doctors don't normally have stocks for. Typhoid and cholera is an example. In that case, you get a script, you get the vaccine and bring back to the doc to administer.
3591 2018-03-03 02:28:24 I know. I truly hope so 
3592 2018-03-03 02:28:03 Slow down your rate of fire and concentrate on shooting accurately. Constant rapid fire cause them to malfunction. Which is the problem with bumpfire stocks, they cause the AR to overheat and malfunction.
3593 2018-03-03 02:26:45 Didn't Putin threaten oil, gas, aluminum, fertilizer, producers, until they made him part owner. Then used govt money to prop up their bottom line. Then used their stocks and partial ownership as bribes and influence. Trump is a Russian asset. This is a Pro Russian operation.
3594 2018-03-03 02:23:46 Snapchat stocks ftw?
3595 2018-03-03 02:22:45 @jimcramer first, you were correct when you said smoot hawley was in 1930 and stocks crashed in 29. However, most bank failures happened in '33. Great Depression was a result of government's reaction to the crash, not the crash itself. Smoot Hawley was leading factor.
3596 2018-03-03 02:21:27 Did Carl Icahn use insider info to dump steel stocks prior to the Moron-in-Chief announcing his horrible tariff plan? Maybe, but it's not like this came out of nowhere.  The idiot has been hinting at it for a while. #biggerfishtofry #Resist

3598 2018-03-03 02:20:27 Hello!! Are you still there??? Are there still stocks!! ^^
3599 2018-03-03 02:20:09 In my first year I made 59%! Beginner's luck? I had v little capital and had a series of single stock holdings. Have rarely matched this pa performance in >15 yrs since. Hold too many stocks now.
3600 2018-03-03 02:19:37 I refuse to eat at @olivegarden because they still sell AR-15s. #boycottolivegarden desist your selling of bump-stocks and sound suppressors as well. This is deplorable behavior for such a fine establishment.
3601 2018-03-03 02:18:53 My mom still stocks drunk food at the house....if that's not a role model I don't know what is
3602 2018-03-03 02:18:49 I don’t know anything at all about stocks and the market, but isn’t what he did illegal??
3603 2018-03-03 02:18:31 We all support the second amendment-that’s not the issue. Let’s stay tuned with respect to Georgia...lots of pieces in play. I’d be tickled pink to see Delta give them the finger, and Amazon too. Meanwhile the needle hasn’t moved on delta stocks.
3604 2018-03-03 02:18:10 Show me where in the Second Amendment it says that people not in a military can own military weapons ban ARs Bump Stocks!
3605 2018-03-03 02:17:25 @jimcramer and I'm going full W Buffett on stocks. Forks and knives out. Ready to feast on value. I'll hold and buy on dips as long as it takes to make cash. Some blue chips look really tasty.
3606 2018-03-03 02:17:04 And tonight on BNN he says we have a 400 year supply of Li and 5x supply vs demand 10 years out ? Who does he think he’s fooling ? What brand of glue is he sniffing or Li stocks shorting ? You can almost see that he’s lying by the expression on his face. (my personal observation)
3607 2018-03-03 02:16:58 Who else did @realdonaldtrump tip off to tariffs so they could dump their stocks...
3608 2018-03-03 02:16:31 The companies didn’t disrespect NRA members. They justifiably disrespected NRA leadership that doesn’t care that 40% of gun transfers require no background checks and that bump stocks are legal.
3609 2018-03-03 02:15:53 an ar-15 is a semiautomatic rifle that can easily be outfitted to act in a similar way go an automatic weapon. Bump stocks and in the recent twitter video of a young man firing an ar-15 at waist level, trigger attached to belt loop.

3612 2018-03-03 02:13:51 AR's are not illegal ma'am ..... neither are large capacity magazines or bump stocks.  All however should be.  21 yrs old should be the age once can purchase a firearm only after a thorough background check.
3613 2018-03-03 02:13:39 He is doing something he just stopped bump stocks and wants to raise min age to 21.

3617 2018-03-03 02:10:57 Support:
1) universal background checks (retail & gun shows) mandated state participation , 2) make illegal: assault weapons (AR 15), armour piercing bullets, & bump stocks,
3) raise legal age to 21

3620 2018-03-03 02:09:43 If the outcome for a stock is binary (e.g. bankrupt or survive), the risk reward profile of using options is much more favorable since the downside is the same, but the upside is not. Joel Greenblatt #stocks #investing
3621 2018-03-03 02:09:40 Wrong. Obama signed bump stocks into law.
3622 2018-03-03 02:08:59 Yeah man I wanna do the stocks and stuff as well I like with crypto you can just go in and wait to see what happens.
3623 2018-03-03 02:08:46 Stocks fell because we got overly dependent on foreign imports rather than American made goods! This wouldn't have happened if the US used AMERICAN steel and AMERICAN aluminum rather than importing it from other countries! President Trump is fixing America one industry at a time!
3624 2018-03-03 02:08:37 Not everyone is saying ban guns. "Assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks" is the usual argument. 
 A 22. calibre hunting rifle or a pistol doesn't need to go, but the people who shouldn't have guns need to be stopped from having and purchasing guns.

3635 2018-03-03 02:00:36 Yup, trumpet Icahn dumped $31M steel stocks last week..........sounds like insider trading for him AND #45
3636 2018-03-03 02:00:16 Delta's values are not for sale, because there's little value in that company to begin with! Oh, and by the way, it takes money and oil for those planes to fly and we will see how greedy they get when their stocks start to plummet!

3639 2018-03-03 01:59:42 True and our forefathers wanted both government & citizens on the same level with fire power.  Times have changed and items like bump stocks as well as high capacity mags should not be necessary however we do have the right to protect & defend ourselves. You can’t always hug

3643 2018-03-03 01:58:15 I like to think the same. But lately I’ve questioned some things. Gun makers stocks and sales go through the roof after each scare.

3645 2018-03-03 01:55:42 Stock was probably fully collapsed. He was just slop-arming it instead of tucking it into his shoulder. Extending the stock to fit him (what collapsible stocks are for) would have helped.

3650 2018-03-03 01:53:18 Or ppl who short stocks. Or deal w drug cartels to launder money. Or instead of investing in communities they spend it on personal bonuses, lobbyists and political candidates.
3651 2018-03-03 01:53:13 Carl Icahn must have had a crystal ball to dump $31 million in steel-related stocks before White House tariff talks, his crystal must have the initials DT ? Legal ?
3652 2018-03-03 01:53:10 Actually steel stocks are the ones that would do well in this mess because their margins expand. The consumers of steel pay the price, which is reflected in this week's dive.
3653 2018-03-03 01:52:23 can i get uhhhhhhhhhhh ban of bump stocks and high capacity magazines
3654 2018-03-03 01:49:14 Eh. Alts are for swing trading except for a couple of solid projects. Just like otc stocks.

As for $BTC, it’s only a matter of time before it breaks up. Tax refunds are coming in and money is coming back to the market. I’m not looking to get rich quick. I’m looking for profit.

3658 2018-03-03 01:47:06 Fine.  Ban AR15s and bump stocks.  Better?

3665 2018-03-03 01:43:48 I agree with some measures like getting rid of bump stocks and better background and mental health checks. But we have an ILLEGAL WEAPON problem in this country. Remember when people actually cared about that 10 years ago?
3666 2018-03-03 01:43:27 Every single time, knowing it would never pass.  In the meantime, bump stocks are still perfectly legal and "danger to self or others" won't enter into the determination to pass the background check.

3672 2018-03-03 01:39:42 When the head of CDC got stocks in tobacco companies, she resigned but this is ok? The appearance of possible of financial gain is enough for him to resign.
3673 2018-03-03 01:37:28 We as a people can do without bump stocks, but we don’t have to ban the AR-15 completely, there’s no reason to. 
3674 2018-03-03 01:37:10 Stocks, investments, relationship,  happiness should be taught in school. When in my entire life has long division ever been  handy?  NEVER!
3675 2018-03-03 01:37:00 Why would you buy stock on the rise? The question is the timing of the sale right before info tanked the market. I'm sure the 8 stocks you purchased did a lot to sway value
3676 2018-03-03 01:36:11 Wow, I shorted the steel industry stocks a long time ago.  If you were listening it was one of his campaign promises.   Were you not listening??  Quit watching CNN.
3677 2018-03-03 01:35:32 This man is almost ALWAYS RIGHT. Wait and see. A few thousand point in stocks means diddly. This is what needed to be done to soften those hardened against us. We must be fearless.
3678 2018-03-03 01:33:54 I havent heard that one. The proposals Ive heard are raising the age to 21, banning bump stocks, and banning a small subset of semi-automatic weapons. Not disarming anybody.

3683 2018-03-03 01:30:35 Too few know what "to short" means in this context , and manipulating stocks is maybe the Number One priority for this sad and dangerous gang. That's were the real money is..
3684 2018-03-03 01:30:35 Already happened . Carl Icahn dumped a bunch of key stocks before announcement.
3685 2018-03-03 01:29:47 You bought stocks based on Trump’s agenda? Really, what has worked so far? No wall, no healthcare reform, no immigration reform. The only thing is the tax cut for corporations and the wealthy and that will crash the stock market at some point
3686 2018-03-03 01:29:34 stock market crashed, his mates cashed in, anyone else NOT see this pattern...ie when lockeed martin's stocks did the same.... FFS am i the ONLY person who has picked this up

3689 2018-03-03 01:28:09 Ok Bill. Let’s say I tell my friends I’m going to announce a TradeWar. They buy up stocks depressed by the news. Then- the TradeWar is called off and the market shoots back up.  That’s Insider Trading Colluding-Right? #RussiaGate #stocks #StockMarket #TradeWars
3690 2018-03-03 01:27:31 Deflect, deflect. Stocks down due to your irresponsible and uninformed tweets on trade. You just want to deflect. Please seek counsel on trade idiot in chief!

3692 2018-03-03 01:26:32 Billionaire Carl Icahn dumps $31 million in steel-related stocks before White House tariff talks

Lawlessness comes to my mind.....oh excuse me ...you can shrug now

thank you
3693 2018-03-03 01:26:27 Not enough. Raise the age to 21. Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Then we have something. This is all easy, non-controversial stuff. Be a man.
3694 2018-03-03 01:26:21 Take a wild guess whose stocks tanked in the wake of this news? The companies that use a lot of steel, maybe? And now what do you think foreign markets will do about suddenly higher-priced American goods? Think tariffs can only go one way? (2/3)
3695 2018-03-03 01:25:53 Nooooo. Your comprehension is lacking. I said the job of a CEO is to add value (monetary) to a company. He doesn’t run a non-profit charity. Shareholders dump losing stocks. His job is not to make you feel better.
3696 2018-03-03 01:25:08 The SEC should investigate, now, whether Drumpf and his spawn are buying or selling key stocks before he makes these wild statements.

He has to know the markets will react strongly. I strongly suspect it’s just another way for them to make money.

The ultimate insider trade.

3698 2018-03-03 01:23:23 Ten,twenty,life is effective,,,making bump stocks an automatic five year felony for possession,and manufacturing, couldn't hurt

3700 2018-03-03 01:23:17 Yep.
- Start with Red Flag law nationwide. 
- Ban bump stocks.
- age restrictions on rifles with magazines of more than 5 round capacity for those under 21.

Everyone still has their 2A rights, unless they’re mentally unstable & rightfully lose that right
3701 2018-03-03 01:22:47 And advisor Carl Icahn.. the let me dump my stocks first guy.
3702 2018-03-03 01:22:41 Same argument that is used for Gold stocks and price, just sayin'. #gold #bitcoin
3703 2018-03-03 01:22:26 There's no reason why citizens should own bump stocks & high capacity magazines unless they are planning a massacre. If Gun free zones were abolish,can we trust people who are in a stressful job to carry a gun?
3704 2018-03-03 01:21:54 I don't support your right to have bumper stocks and extended magazines, I don't care what your fantasies are.

3710 2018-03-03 01:20:28 @realDonaldTrump 
I didn't vote for you but I believed you wouldn't kiss the NRA's  butt. Thought only needy Repubs would. You don't need their money or bull. Stop those assault weapons and bump stocks. Don't give into the bullies who would rather see dead kids than lower sales.

3713 2018-03-03 01:17:07 All his buddies, using insider information sold off stocks affected by the iron/aluminum import tariffs. Now they will buy in again and ride them back up. #LOCKHIMUP.
3714 2018-03-03 01:16:36 The entire party needs to be voted out, we can still have a two party system, liberal Democrats & progressive Democrats. History has shown the country is at is best unemployment, dept, stocks, crime etc...when dems are in charge that’s just a fact.
3715 2018-03-03 01:14:01 I don’t think they’re talking about Facebook solely rather the combined monies in stocks after they fell the last several hours thanks to trump lol
3716 2018-03-03 01:13:28 The economy, stocks, housing prices have all been on the rise for eight years....long before Trump took office.  
You really think he is responsible for it?  
That is insanely laughable.
#CultOfTrump strikes again
So stupid
3717 2018-03-03 01:13:07 Start by raising the age to buy a semi automatic rifle to 21, by banning large capacity magazines, by banning bump stocks, by joining the vast majority of Americans that want AR-15 and the likes banned, by universal background checks and start by regaining your soul from the NRA
3718 2018-03-03 01:11:03 I support the NRA. They are about gun SAFETY. Your efforts might have more if an impact if you focus on the real issues: bump stocks and assault rifles.
3719 2018-03-03 01:09:41 willing to ban bump stocks as the #NRA wanted when Obama let them be sold

Willing to make sure data gets into the background check system as it should

Mandatory reporters should report

3720 2018-03-03 01:09:36 Bumps stocks are BS and we have background checks but entering people into the system for it to work has failed. Raising the ahe is stupid but ok raise the age to 21 for gun purchase as well as voter age. Can't be trusted with a gun than voting as well.
3721 2018-03-03 01:08:56 muzDerp stocks are on the rise buy in now! #crypto (I'm ready for bot follows from this tweet)
3722 2018-03-03 01:08:43 AYFKM? We couldn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas and the NRA did not oppose that. Let's get our expectation level in order, and achieve the possible.
3723 2018-03-03 01:07:51 Certain equities are way over priced, and some are still fairly priced. I like commodity stocks, gold and oil primarily. BTC is interesting with everything going on but not something I’d want a large % of my capital in.
3724 2018-03-03 01:06:32 $HGEN +15.38%, $SCIA +4.97%, $MCD -4.77%

3725 2018-03-03 01:05:47 Really? And u don’t say shit about Putin ? U won’t impose sanctions against Russia? U won’t ban bump stocks or assault weapons !? This is what your are upset about! Give me a fucking break!!!!
3726 2018-03-03 01:05:27 So far it seems only Trish, Charles and Lou on FBN agree with tariffs. Even Maria this morning thinks the tariffs are bad idea. FBN losing it today banner on TV “Stocks take a dive because of Trumps tariffs” but DOW is -133.
3727 2018-03-03 01:04:16 I Cahn needed to cash in some stocks.
3728 2018-03-03 01:03:29 Let’s all remember that 80% of Americans do not own stocks... I believe that figure takes into account that some pensioners don’t own individual stocks, but are effectively in the market. Bottom line: once again, the 1% (or in this case the 20%) benefit more than most...
3729 2018-03-03 01:03:28 My bad of putting out numbers that we're incorrect. The point being... The Netherlands is very cheaps in taxing their ppl trading professional in stocks/crypto basicly... If you compare it to neighbour country's. That tax up ppl for 30-50%.
3730 2018-03-03 01:03:09 there are universal background checks, assault weapons is just a look of a gun, it has no effect on function. bump stocks, or the actual term "slide fire stocks" dont mechanically change anything, it makes a technique possible from the shoulder. Ive used them, (1/2)
3731 2018-03-03 01:02:35 Stocks Dow. Wonder who did that.
3732 2018-03-03 01:02:07 What so you think of $CHK at 2.90's ?
3733 2018-03-03 01:01:59 Yeah got a website and all. They are saying no to the release of the herpes virus claiming it’s the government making us believe carp are destroying native fish stocks to cover up some shit. 
Just another bunch of dumb fucks in this world that shouldn’t breed!
3734 2018-03-03 01:01:51 Wonder who else dumped steel stocks?
3735 2018-03-03 01:00:09 False partnering. You are stating your ideas and trying to manipulate us/the message. We want:
1. Ban automatic rifles
2. Ban bump stocks etc
3. Universal background CKs
4. Min Age restriction 21 
5. Gun license every gun 
6. 30 day wait
7. No sales at gun shows
#EnoughIsEnough
3736 2018-03-03 01:00:05 The article said steel related stocks. It doesn’t matter what stock it was, it was influenced by trumps decision to set tariffs, on steel.  You get it now?
3737 2018-03-03 01:00:01 Hugh didn't get that sweet inside info to be able to dump his stocks in time.
3738 2018-03-03 00:59:55 Next week, we‘ll see the WH walk back 21 (to 18) and we‘ll be able to focus on concessions that look tough but don‘t lose votes. Looks like bump stocks are out.
3739 2018-03-03 00:59:42 Ha, wallet, stocks, bonds, 401k, whatever it takes..
3740 2018-03-03 00:59:31 Icahn shorting steel stocks last week??
3741 2018-03-03 00:59:24 Insider trading, and Trump would have benefited as well through his stocks.
3742 2018-03-03 00:59:16 #managing #money requires more skill than making it. ..!!
#StockMarkets #StockMarket #stocks #investing #quote #bestwishes
3743 2018-03-03 00:59:08 Weren't they mad at you for raising the age for assault rifles, banning bump stocks, and increasing difficulty owning guns by the mentally unstable?
3744 2018-03-03 00:58:04 What about the ton of $$$ his friend made/saved by selling his Steel stocks a few days before the Drumpf announcement? Don't you have insider trading alws in the USA any more??! He's a THIEF and a FRAUD. Ditch the #Dolt45
3745 2018-03-03 00:57:42 @Delta needs to announce its desire to relocate to another state citing Georgia's willingness to punish businesses for caring about our nation's children.  I need my dividends in popcorn stocks to pay big this year.
3746 2018-03-03 00:57:39 also two of your stocks are in my bag. 
$SRMX loaded @ .003 and still holding. $NSEH, loaded at 0.0002 and still holding. I have personal opinion on both that determines my exit but not willing to share. Good luck
3747 2018-03-03 00:57:36 Steel stocks are up. Genius
3748 2018-03-03 00:57:11 You can also choose.....to buy "NO" stocks........and wait for calmer markets !!
3749 2018-03-03 00:56:19 3/ next, he really doesn’t have some solution he stands by. Apparently bump stocks he wants to personally write out. Good for him, we all applaud that. Background checks would be good and raising the age to 21 are pretty bipartisan...
3750 2018-03-03 00:56:11 I thought it was only bump stocks?
3751 2018-03-03 00:55:48 Some people should not own stocks, because they get too upset when prices fall down : Buffett
3752 2018-03-03 00:55:38 His buddy Icahn traded stocks on it a week or more ahead of time. This was planned.
3753 2018-03-03 00:55:35 Is @Vanguard_Group going to offer investors same option of owned stocks as #BlackRock
3754 2018-03-03 00:54:37 Banning assault weapons, mega magazines, bump stocks, universal background checks.
3755 2018-03-03 00:54:22 because that would give cohn enough time to move his remaining accounts off shore, get rid of his steel/alum stocks, and stock up his bunker
3756 2018-03-03 00:51:27 A case was filed at the WTO since the tariff violated our commitments and were not imposed for either import surge could trip or because of a national security risk.

As a sidebar, former advisor Carl Icahn dumped millions in steel stocks a few days before the announcement.
3757 2018-03-03 00:51:11 The fact that all of @realDonaldTrump’s billionaire crony’s have been dumping all of their steel stocks. Remind me of Hitlers Nazi regime trying to hide and steal gold and money before the allied forces invaded and liberated Germany from tyranny.
3758 2018-03-03 00:50:03 Man. What a way to ruin a joke. Not like you asked if they came with unlimited cheesy bump stocks.
3759 2018-03-03 00:49:58 all i care about is money, weed, my stocks, and my credit score
3760 2018-03-03 00:49:19 Nobody. Absolutely no one serving legislatively, is proposing banning "every gun in America".Ban bump stocks. Raise the age to 21. Upgrade background checks. Thats it. And that means that you, can go tomorrow and buy a brand new handgun. Ot 20, if you wish. Awesome, right?
3761 2018-03-03 00:49:08 You are not " just talking", because its actually called lying.  You stated you are banning bump stocks because they "make semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic rifles."  That is an outright lie.  They make a semi-automatic rifle into nothing more than a semi-automatic rifle
3762 2018-03-03 00:48:02 On 10/26/17, #ECB said it would extend but taper #QE. Since then, US stocks have outperformed French & German stocks by +1,095 & +1,450 bps!
3763 2018-03-03 00:47:06 Senator:  50% of Americans own stocks.  Buy backs raise share prices. Great for all  investors including average Americans saving for retirement.   JM
3764 2018-03-03 00:46:58 I asked a direct question; why can't you answer it? I shouldn't have to call. Does SCHK have gun stocks or not?
3765 2018-03-03 00:46:52 Great day for buying stocks right charlie
3766 2018-03-03 00:46:47 How many companies have used the extra money to buy back stocks instead -enriching owners and stock owners?
3767 2018-03-03 00:46:47 Wouldn't doubt that Icahn isn't the only Trump associate who benefited from the tariff announcement. How many shorted stocks and profited from the pounding the market took this week. Yet another example of the danger posed by a president with continuing business interests.
3768 2018-03-03 00:46:43 Duh, I should have recognized it as a mini-14, the folding stock threw me, the only ones I've handled had standard stocks. Your barrel looks a little different too, what version is it?
3769 2018-03-03 00:46:37 Outlaw AR-15 type rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors and cross state cc. Ownership of firearms must be qualified and regulated.
3770 2018-03-03 00:46:30 Add "Getting a kickback from the millions his buddy Icahn earned from dumping steel-related stocks days before trump's decree to impose tariffs. They are all so neck-deep in money-mob-related crap that it'll take a genius to ferret it all out. Thank goodness Mueller is a genius.
3771 2018-03-03 00:45:51 Daily News headline:"Billionaire Carl Icahn dumps $31M in steel-related stocks before White House tariff talks" Yeah, that's a co-inky-dink...
3772 2018-03-03 00:43:40 @AGPamBondi You either outright lied or you need to educate yourself about that which u wish to ban. You stated "bump stocks make semi-automatic rifles fully automatic rifle." This is absolutely incorrect. It doesnt make semi-automatic rifle a fully  automatic rifle.Ashamed of u!
3773 2018-03-03 00:43:37 AR-15 or AK-47. Come on, you know what an assault weapon is. And no bump stocks ever.
3774 2018-03-03 00:42:34 Parepareho tayong nangangailangan uy. Ang sakin lang eh nagnenegosyo ako at di ko nililimot pambili ko ng stocks.
3775 2018-03-03 00:41:30 Definitely! It is natural considering in the last 9.5 years TSX Total Return only went up 36% but Dow Jones Total Return went up 180%! Many CAD immigrants are from countries that don't have a healthy/mature stock market so those continue to invest in housing rather than stocks.
3776 2018-03-03 00:41:14 NRA visited the White House as Trump cowered under a blanket peeked out & said I won’t do anything not even ban bump stocks deal done
3777 2018-03-03 00:40:48 Ross must downplay the results of tariffs or he’s out the door. Ex-advisor sold off millions in steel related stocks in advance of announcement. Hmmm 
3778 2018-03-03 00:40:12 So you agree change is needed. That, like car insurance, the incidence of accidents (shootings) is much higher in the 18-25 age bracket than those older. I'm talking sensible but thorough b/ground checks with 5 day wait 4 security. No b/stocks for this group
3779 2018-03-03 00:40:02 The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place. #forex #stocks #cryptocurrency
3780 2018-03-03 00:39:56 Why do people need high capacity magazines & bump stocks? Why not stricter universal background checks? If 18-year-olds can't 
Purchase cigarettes/alcohol,why should they purchase a gun?
3781 2018-03-03 00:39:11 Like using social media as a public shaming, put them in the stocks mentality, which the Justice should be seen to be above.
3782 2018-03-03 00:39:08 "Trump hasn't stopped tweeting about other aspects of the economy. That might be a smart move. Many experts have noted how most average Americans don't benefit from the stock market's rise, since only half of American families hold stocks in their retirement accounts"
3783 2018-03-03 00:38:42 Stocks to watch: $GCLL 2nd day mass vol & very green. $EKWX 2nd mass vol as well. 
3784 2018-03-03 00:38:14 Trump insider buddy sells steel stocks out of the blue days before Trump's out of the blue unilateral steel tariff

(same president who won't impose sanctions passed by house & senate by the way)

but back to his buddy... suspicious?

Didn't Martha Stewart go to prison for this?
3785 2018-03-03 00:36:49 Could it be because he bought stocks in the steel industry last week and announced his “push” of the trade war this week? Collusion? Let’s see- what do they call that when brokers do that? Inside trading? Sounds illegal doesn’t it? Nixon-ish?
3786 2018-03-03 00:36:33 1月のことだけど、stocks exchange  からBINANCEに0.2BTC送金した際に、2回入金があった。
アドレスの１つは自分、もう１つは不明。額は同じ。よくわからず放置してたら、1週間くらい後にstocks exchange  のBTC残金がマイナスになってて、全てのコインが出金不可になってた。
3787 2018-03-03 00:35:36 And whether #DonTheCon invested in any said stocks just after slamming down the tariffs. 

And if it crossed Jr's -- or Sr's -- mind that any TO projects using steel might have to pay more, depressing their own portfolio's value?
3788 2018-03-03 00:35:11 I just had an idea.... Hear me out.... Drive Thru Guns, with every AR-15 we give out a happy meal and Bump Stocks
3789 2018-03-03 00:34:22 @PeterSchiff how come nobody talks about amazon they've been crushing jobs and companies by selling below cost for years destroying competition all they have to do is threaten to go into an industry and there stocks crater the gov't has to put a stop to this
3790 2018-03-03 00:32:58 Escurese el fondo wapete y Ponle stocks
3791 2018-03-03 00:32:53 BAN ASSAULT-TYPE WEAPONS.
BAN BUMP STOCKS.
BAN LARGE-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
BAN ARMOR-PIERCING COP-KILLER ROUNDS.
BAN SALES OF RIFLES TO UNDER-21.
BAN SALES WITHOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS, INCLUDING PRIVATE OR GUN-SHOW SALES.  

STOP VALUING GUNS OVER OUR CHILDREN!!!!!!!
3792 2018-03-03 00:32:00 Usually when money disappears from stocks, it turns up soon after in $BTC and other $Crypto. I recall this happening a lot between the raises and dips in #bitcoin price last year.

#bullish
3793 2018-03-03 00:30:40 And the stocks after he dumped.  Made $5-10 million off this trade would be my guess
3794 2018-03-03 00:30:10 It's looking more promising by the hour. It seems like bitcoin is looking more and more attractive to retail investors over stocks and the SEC's stance on ICO's is making them look less and less attractive.
3795 2018-03-03 00:29:34 Wall Street got everything they wanted,but now their greedy and don't want jobs for middle America,they want more profit from their foreign stocks!! Too bad!
3796 2018-03-03 00:29:23 Why ban pistol grips, thumbhole stocks and adjustable stocks?
3797 2018-03-03 00:29:14 Steel stocks shot up after Trump announcement, which was abrupt and not planned by all accounts.
3798 2018-03-03 00:29:05 IPOs refer to how stocks are traded (on the public market), not who owns it. The owners are the people who own the stocks NOT the entire public. The stocks ARE available for public purchase. Also in citizens united the corporations represented were IPOs. So now they dont have 1A?
3799 2018-03-03 00:28:50 Im sure she is referring to NRA backers who boycotted the airline and others too. Delta was a total fail in all this. We make a better impact on our boycotts than any lefty ever could. Just look at some of their stocks (within 24 hours) when they announced banning NRA.
3800 2018-03-03 00:28:16 Поздно пить Боржоми, если почки отстегнулись
3801 2018-03-03 00:27:24 He probably forgot to dump his steel stocks, damn it! #GOPTraitors #weaselryan
3802 2018-03-03 00:26:58 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CNN @donlemon Can you spell INSIDER TRADING !!!!! Steel stocks sold....?????
3803 2018-03-03 00:26:44 Glad you won’t buy stocks, then
3804 2018-03-03 00:26:40 The pretzel bites are life, my dad's garage stocks them pretty much cause my family like them
3805 2018-03-03 00:26:37 Stocks is life
3806 2018-03-03 00:26:35 Hey Andy only bitches correct grammar! My point is, stocks has nothing to do with Lou’s post so why are you that stupid to post it? Do you not care jobless rates are at an all time low since the 70’s or you mad Trump put money in our pockets you must hate Americans than or then
3807 2018-03-03 00:25:55 if we want to trade high flyers, i would just trade $spy and avoid single stocks. $spy offers massive protection from wild swings and the swings are controlled and level's hold nicely.
3808 2018-03-03 00:25:48 Not Trump and his cronies who will work the stock market and make a bundle on steel, aluminum and auto stocks.
Several already are.
3809 2018-03-03 00:25:00 Check Carl Icahn. Dumped $31M worth of steel-related stocks last week.
3810 2018-03-03 00:23:47 @xile737 @g66 now that doesn’t mean that they’re going to be issuing those shares at that price for 5 years does it? I’m new to stocks.
3811 2018-03-03 00:23:24 @piersmorgan At last, America is waking up. ( Sat FT 4th March)
BlackRock, the worlds largest global equities firm is advising its investors to ditch US firearm stocks.  
Change is finally happening. Not through political pressure or the media but from the victims actions.
3812 2018-03-03 00:22:01 @NRA @DLoesch your obsession with the 2nd amendment written years ago before there were bump stocks and AR-15 is systemically killing our children and the country you claim to hold dear. I f-ing hate you and i do not use that word lightly. Ur souls are rotten.
3813 2018-03-03 00:21:57 Old white men running around insider trading in industrial stocks... American ingenuity at its finest.
3814 2018-03-03 00:21:50 Who was the woman who had tobacco stocks?
3815 2018-03-03 00:21:50 Once markets begin swinging up and down more than 1% per day, the severity of the swings almost always worsens. Individual stocks have been swinging unusually for over a year, but no one pays attention. A huge cap stock shouldn't swing 5%, but they are and that is scary.
3816 2018-03-03 00:21:47 Or trumps buddies making money on the stocks over tariffs!
3817 2018-03-03 00:20:32 He also traded stocks while he was actively working as an advisor on issues that dealt with those stocks.
3818 2018-03-03 00:20:21 Before he announced it, his billionaire friends sold his stocks and milliymore. Niw he will retreat from the tarrif as he always dies and they will make millions more. Si pathetic
3819 2018-03-03 00:20:07 Thanks Obama! Obama, you did an incredible job bringing us back from the disaster the RepubliTARDS put us in!! As the stocks plunge over 1000 points in 3 days, with dumb ass trump in office, the Great Recession 3 is around the corner!
3820 2018-03-03 00:20:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
3821 2018-03-03 00:18:46 Trump did not announce tariffs because he had a temper tantrum. Paul Icahn dumped $31 million in steel-linked stocks shortly before the tariff announcement was made. This is a work, plain and simple.
3822 2018-03-03 00:17:57 You're misrepresenting things. 80% agree with a couple common sense things like better background checks, banning bump stocks and closing the private seller (aka gun show) loophole.

That is the extent 80% supports gun control.
3823 2018-03-03 00:17:33 Doing pretty damn good so far. Record high stocks, record low unemployment, ISIS running back to their caves, 50% fewer illegals crossing the border and more going home every day, tax cuts and wall underway. Exactly the things I hired him for.
3824 2018-03-03 00:17:05 There’s a reason they’re going for $1800. It’s because they’re not just easy to get or everyone would get em
3825 2018-03-03 00:16:13 I mean u waited a pretty long time to ask. If ur in UK. You have way more options. US. U have some. But if ur not using ur bots and proxies and shit for the few spots releasing. Don’t count on it. Just being realistic.
3826 2018-03-03 00:16:02 @jimcramer Thanks for that great explanation on Mad Money of the alum and steel tariffs and their impact or lack thereof on stocks. A real master class.
3827 2018-03-03 00:15:44 Mandatory background checks, more thorough background checks, no gun show loophole, banning guns like AR-15s and similar, reinstating the assault weapon ban, banning bump stocks, not allowing domestic abusers to have guns, 10 round mag capacity limit...
3828 2018-03-03 00:15:17 You and your disciples caused America to lose billions of $s with your tax cut for the wealthy. Maybe Mueller will have another filet on his plate -insider trading. Ck to see who sold off stocks b4 your irresponsible actions. How about sanctions on Russia you .
3829 2018-03-03 00:13:49 I just hope @chucktodd doesn’t let MR Ed’s @WilburRoss get off easy. Ask him how much he has invested in steel and aluminum stocks and if #CarlIcahn sold stock with prior knowledge of tariffs.
3830 2018-03-03 00:13:22 Jim Cramer looks ahead to key events next week and tells investors there's more to stocks than just the Trump…
3831 2018-03-03 00:12:39 A 3 o’clock pint after work means me leaving Stocks now 
3832 2018-03-03 00:12:17 Where's whipping post Stocks Camps Ovens?

YR these inhuman ignormuses, incapable of reasoning, harassing & stealing paying customer & his guest's food? and telling HIM to calm down?! Self-important idiots.
Oh, right, the man is poor & hungry ...  & THAT'S a crime
#EnoughIsEnough
3833 2018-03-03 00:10:45 Ironically they all sold there stocks before Trump  announcement !!
get it wink wink
3834 2018-03-03 00:10:17 is there any stocks on pornhub. im bout to invest
3835 2018-03-03 00:09:20 #ELA doesnt need covering...just buy and reap the rewards...
Just shows some stocks dont need ramping just a good bod...
Covered it as a buy at 25p...
3836 2018-03-03 00:08:38 Trump is probably using this to short steel and aluminum stocks, next week he will go back on his word and he will have stuffed his pockets a little more as he is doing with everything. By the time he leaves office or is kicked out he will have refilled his empty coffers!
3837 2018-03-03 00:07:45 Life changing for who?  By the time it gets taxed, and all insurance, etc... it won't be $1000.  Middle income families will pay bills vs putting extra money in a money generating savings, stocks, etc...
3838 2018-03-03 00:06:47 There is a reason everyone except a handful of nutters wants to ban bump stocks...
3839 2018-03-03 00:06:46 Your life is dedicated to a game where the highlight of your career will be to take half of a god's total stocks. Wrong person bro
3840 2018-03-03 00:05:41 you actually have no proof of that claim the eliminating bump stocks or other items along with high cap mags will do any bit of good. it is an assertion based on nothing more than personal feelings. even if you ban the objects that doesn't mean people can't fashion their own.
3841 2018-03-03 00:05:18 @BillGates  u scared bro?  Dump your stocks and put it in #cryptocurrency ?  $btc #bitcoin
3842 2018-03-03 00:04:08 A firm can easily trick people into buying things. Look at stocks, for example. Most of the time, stocks do not pay dividends and do not provide actual power unless you have a massive number. Their only value is that you might be able to sell them for more later.
3843 2018-03-03 00:03:23 Trump warned his millionaire friends so they could sell their stocks than he went on a toddler tantrum and started a trade war Trump is dangerous. Republican lead congress need to hold him accountable their silence is disgraceful they are complicit to his criminal behaviour

3845 2018-03-03 00:00:51 Might be fucked up but that shit made my stocks look better
3846 2018-03-03 00:00:41 Mr President, How can you in good conscience be against the Second Amendment? Your talking about banning bump stocks and gun ownership under 21, for the same Young Americans you send off to war, to protect our freedoms, freedoms  your taking away from them! Rethink it!  God Bless
3847 2018-03-03 00:00:32 Have nice weekend dude. Hope insiders buy some of my other stocks next lol
3848 2018-03-03 00:00:29 This plan has the foundation for a great plan except it doesn’t address access to assault rifles..high capacity magazines...bump stocks..or age restrictions to fire arms. Is your plan endorsed by the NRA?
3849 2018-03-03 00:00:24 And then she just says meaningless platitudes. Have you seen an NRA ad ever? They treat a ban on bump stocks like it's a red revolution. But misreading a law abiding gun owner makes them wait a year then hedge.
3850 2018-03-03 00:00:21 The majority of gun owners support banning bump stocks and other attachments to make a weapon an automatic weapon. You do not need them for hunting or target practice. Most agree in better background checks. These were not even allowed out of committee.
3851 2018-03-03 00:00:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. trade forex stocks
3852 2018-03-02 23:59:19 Smh these gas prices higher than my stocks
3853 2018-03-02 23:58:33 Huh. I often make the argument that "You can buy a gun at Walmart, for fuck's sake," but I logged into WM1 today, and they don't sell modern sporting rifles or handguns (except in Alaska) or "bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories."

3855 2018-03-02 23:57:27 @billmaher don't you think POTUS put millions of stocks into American steel companies before he made the announcement to raise the cost of imported steel. But he won't sign the bill, and will put the stocks back into foreign steel, and then make a ton off that as well, just sayin

3892 2018-03-02 23:45:11 Global market will bounce back.
And I will make a killing on stocks.
All good.
3893 2018-03-02 23:45:07 You never answered what exactly @POTUS isn’t taking seriously about gun control.  So far 2 town house meetings with families and state governors to discuss ideas and plans for change.  Already is going to ban bump stocks via executive order!  Waiting?
3894 2018-03-02 23:45:06 Soooooo... you want to keep guns away form dangerous people but don't support some common sense changes to laws dealing with guns? Didn't you all oppose universal background checks? And banning bump stocks? And the Assault Weapons ban? Your tweet means nothing.
3895 2018-03-02 23:45:02 Of course not.  Your will rise up in righteousness and take your revenge on all Liberals!  What kind of clown are you.  Assault Rifles are not protected by 2nd.  2nd doesn't protect full auto.  Ban AR type, bump stocks and raise age to 21.  Better background checks! DT is Puppet.
3896 2018-03-02 23:44:18 ...not to mention Karl Icahn making a killing (in the $millions) by dumping his foreign steel stocks just a few days prior to....well you guessed it.
3897 2018-03-02 23:44:14 Time to invest in Opioid stocks?
3898 2018-03-02 23:43:57 Bump stocks at a all time low so buy them now
3899 2018-03-02 23:43:50 So... Martha Stewart went to jail for insider trading but Drumpf’s friend/finance guy dumps 30million in steel related stocks literally the day before POTUS announces new steel tariffs and no one raises an eyebrow?
3900 2018-03-02 23:41:33 What was he doing sitting on millions in steel related stocks anyway?  its been terrible sector.  Hes got great timing however, US steel companies should come roaring back.  Just dont understand why this is a breaking story.
3901 2018-03-02 23:41:13 stocks shrug off permabears
3902 2018-03-02 23:40:28 What about Carl Icahn dumping millions in steel related stocks? Got the scoop from @realDonaldTrump beforehand ...yet another investigation that should happen with the Corrupt WH

3904 2018-03-02 23:40:20 sorry. i recall ichan made money as an unpaid advisor to drumpf.  i thought you may've remembered how.
perhaps he didn't, i was wrong.
that he sold $30 million in steel stocks before drump's tariffs is entirely coincidental as well.
3905 2018-03-02 23:40:06 The most impeachable corruption from this afternoon:

A. SEC drops Apollo invest. after Kushner got loans;

B. Ichan knew to dump $31 million in steel related stocks;

C. Kushner retaliation vs. Qatar using his US position;

D. None of above. Corrupt don’t impeach for corruption.
3906 2018-03-02 23:38:51 PTJ doesn't trade price?  One of his main rules is to avoid stocks whose PRICE is below the 200sma.
3907 2018-03-02 23:38:49 I’m sure no ANALysts are revising forecasts saying the worst is over and it’s time to buy back beaten stocks. 

Then maybe the market f8cks everyone again next week and goes lower after this deadcat. 
3908 2018-03-02 23:37:49 Yes, I would think so... But normally I would think his crony would be buying stocks not selling. Though it’s entirely possible he told his buddy the exact opposite of what he ended up doing.

3911 2018-03-02 23:36:11 The Dow was overpriced and overdue for a correction.  This is a good buying opportunity to get in at a cheaper price while idiots worry about tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Stocks will rebound when people realize Trump's decision is good for America and American workers.
3912 2018-03-02 23:36:04 @SenSherrodBrown: please work to pass universal background checks, raise the purchase age for weapons to 21, prohibit gun sales to people with mental illness and those who have engaged in physical and sexual abuse, ban bump stocks, and ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons.
3913 2018-03-02 23:35:46 Icahn selling millions in steel stocks a week before Trump announces tarriffs. Kushner supporting blocking qatar after they denied him an investment. Kush getting massive investments after meeting CEOs at WH. Carson spending tens of thousands on furniture. That's just this WEEK.

3917 2018-03-02 23:35:15 I personally think some teammates like to help their draft stocks by not getting into the media, and talk bad about their teammates because they know teams will think it transitions to the NFL. 

But what do I know, I’m not in the locker room. We don’t know the facts. 
3918 2018-03-02 23:35:01 Hmmm, something stinks.....stocks tanked shortly after discussions were held with steel/aluminium imports to the  , im wondering if the pres is doing this so his "mates" can $$ in, it would only take a single  call to inform of such a decision 
3919 2018-03-02 23:34:59 Oh c'mon!  You can't be serious.  That list is insulting. Let me help.
1. Ban AR-15 type weapons
2. Ban Bump Stocks
3. Increase age from 18 to 21 for gun purchases
4. Mental illness restrictions
3920 2018-03-02 23:33:28 The markets are being driven by 4 or 5 tech stocks. #Dolt45 focuses on old industries that no longer drive our information economy. Old man thinking will not help us. @realdonaldtrump is an old fool.

3925 2018-03-02 23:32:27 Carl Ican selling off steel stocks before trumps announcement, something smells like insider trading

didn't reveal how ichan benefitted...
like
he didn't just sell $30million of steel stocks?
yeah

3928 2018-03-02 23:31:34 @ReformedBroker Josh - I loved your recent comments on CNBC about putting in limit orders at absurd prices on stocks that u have missed out on. What are your thoughts on selling Put options in these situations so you pick up a premium while waiting?
3929 2018-03-02 23:31:06 Let's all swap to wood stocks, it won't be scary anymore.
3930 2018-03-02 23:29:56 Very impressive shooting, however, we know for a fact that the shooter in Las Vegas did have a bump stock and used them to kill over fifty in a very short period of time. Eliminating bump stocks and similar items along with high cap magazines will help keep the body count down.
3931 2018-03-02 23:28:44 Can’t wait for fin journos to just type:

WE’VE RUN OUT OF BULLSHIT, SO STOCKS MOVED BECAUSE THEY CAN
3932 2018-03-02 23:28:14 So what is the explanation for the bounce? 

STOCKS SHRUG OFF POSSIBLE TRADE WAR? 

STOCKS SHRUG OFF STEEL TARIFFS PLAN?
3933 2018-03-02 23:27:49 He must own private prison stocks. Or he's a big racist douchenozzle.
3934 2018-03-02 23:27:39 Yes, Lawrence! What if it is a con?
Icahn dumps millions. But when did he buy them?
Same with aluminum - Russian dumps stocks.
Bet you that Trump will walk the whole tariff deal back. Everyone will be happy and forget about the real scam  - insider trading!
Total con game;
3935 2018-03-02 23:27:22 Why would we need to ban bum stocks?  The 2nd amendment says the right to ban arms will not be infringed, right?  Are fully automatic weapons not arms??  Please explain.
3936 2018-03-02 23:26:57 Not nearly enough Marco.  How’s about banning tactical-assault weapons, high capacity clips, bump stocks,raising age for purchase of legal weapons, back-ground checks, central reporting of back-ground checks, for a start.
3937 2018-03-02 23:26:56 Martha didn’t go to prison because she sold thousands of her stock.  Martha had inside information, then she sold her stocks, that’s what got her in trouble and prison term.
3938 2018-03-02 23:26:47 Had he known inside information Icahn would have dumped 20x these stocks. Just had a small play on a public hunch - it was all over the news. There's an easy defense.
3939 2018-03-02 23:26:28 What! You started far too late.  No wonder my stocks were flat today.
3940 2018-03-02 23:26:09 Ça va "ruisseler" !!!!
3941 2018-03-02 23:25:48 My stock was up 3% this week. This is not the time to hold on to funds and indexes. This is the age of individual stocks.
3942 2018-03-02 23:25:01 No one is suggesting curbing anyone's speech.
News, however, is a packaged & sold commodity
much like Pharmaceuticals are a packaged & sold commodity
& both News & Drug industy stocks are publicly traded,
ergo News data should prove as truthful as Prescription data
to avoid harm.
3943 2018-03-02 23:24:01 So former trump advisor billionaire Carl Icahn sold off more than $30 MILLION in stocks of his heavily STEEL dependent company just days before trump's tariff announcement saving him millions of dollars. Hmm I wonder who (trump) could have inspired him to do THAT out of the blue?
3944 2018-03-02 23:23:20 all this tariff talk has me wondering, what that got to do with bio stocks?  nothing ok so then maybe bio stocks is safe haven for now
3945 2018-03-02 23:22:44 Please IT’s buddy sold 31 mill in steel stocks today
3946 2018-03-02 23:22:21 Over 90% support background checks.  I would start there.  Then bump stocks, etc.  One at a time.  The only reason regulation is not done this way is because it's easier to block when talked about comprehensively.
3947 2018-03-02 23:21:46 Yes they are! THEY ARE #Systematically ATTACKING MANY #STOCKS - Truth needs to be brought forth, before he and his buddies ruin honest people. 
3948 2018-03-02 23:20:58 * cut dental and vision coverage in the Medicaid in Kentucky for adults in certain instances. If they don't pay premiums within 60 days...  Fox News first: A.) WS looked to rebound today after Trump's comments sent stocks tumbling yesterday with
3949 2018-03-02 23:20:54 COSEWIC's  emergency letter to Minister of Environment, Catherine Mckenna, refers to a 15-25% post-release mortality, although it is not cited in the COSEWIC emergency report on these steelhead stocks. Probably comes from other catch release studies.
3950 2018-03-02 23:20:42 Enter raffles.
3951 2018-03-02 23:20:23 I only look for dividend stocks
3952 2018-03-02 23:20:16 To be fair, I was expecting both stocks and crypto to tank today. Neither did. 
It would be too naive to think that such a widespread consensus would be void. Likely delayed.
3953 2018-03-02 23:19:46 I think the only way these make sense is if the 'fancier ingredients' aren't readily available to someone and they want to occasionally have something unusual.

But if you're ordering more than one every couple of weeks or so, set up your stocks and do it yourself!
3954 2018-03-02 23:19:18 Before 6 o’clock I was making one two trade purchases to bring the percent back to a positive percentage. It is #TooEasy << people need to pay more attention on how to handle these stupid short-sellers!! 
3955 2018-03-02 23:19:07 Instead of helping out your buddy Carl Ichan with selling off $31 million in steel stocks before you made your irresponsible comments, how about subsidizing the steel industry so they can compete? Remember you made the stock market great!
3956 2018-03-02 23:19:03 @ChrisDanielShow OK, I can understand a total dump of stocks drawing suspicion. What percentage of stocks do you have to get rid of in order for it to be considered insider trading?
3957 2018-03-02 23:17:13 #tytlive The only people winning in the Trump era are the 1% shorting stocks now.
3958 2018-03-02 23:16:25 TD Ameritrade 
3959 2018-03-02 23:16:25 So when is America supposed to be great again? Stocks down, world hates us, nuclear uncertainty, crooks in the WH, etc. I worked my whole life just to lose it all because we have a idiot leader.
3960 2018-03-02 23:16:08 Tell me about how much your buddy Carl Ichan made selling off steel stocks after you gave him “heads up.”
3961 2018-03-02 23:15:47 Something to do with $stocks and $shares I think.
3962 2018-03-02 23:15:30 All my stocks are up. 

Bless.
3963 2018-03-02 23:15:27 I am glad my team can help! Let us know if there’s anything we can do to help spread the word about other #StockMarketScammers like CLAY
3964 2018-03-02 23:13:44 after the stocks plunge, Ichan will buy them back and Trump will say......"I was only kidding, I'm a free trader.    At least for this week.......next week?.....stay tuned.
3965 2018-03-02 23:13:03 Corrin is basically a slightly worse version of Cloud

- Team combos into bite KO mad early (like FT but fairer)

- Good aerials for team combos  (fair, nair) and taking stocks (uair, bair, pin)

- Still decently heavy

- Still does well vs Bayo

- Worst dubs MU has been removed
3966 2018-03-02 23:12:52 NIce! I have played four stocks this week all winners holding on to $DNR over the weekend.
3967 2018-03-02 23:12:14 Trumps tariffs not only were not vetted with any Federal agencies or staff In fact it appears he told Carl Icahn to dump his steel stocks ahead of his announcement also reported that his abrupt decision came b/c he was unhappy with constant neg news reports abt Jared ..HISSY FIT!
3968 2018-03-02 23:12:14 $$PDXP VICT CHIT$$ Remember folks!!I SCAM may go full tilt this weekend bashing these stocks to get you to sell...PLEASE don't listen to the noise.There is enough DD supporting these 3 stocks to cover the globe. it's the 9th inning stretch and they will go till the bell rings Mon
3969 2018-03-02 23:12:12 You did vote for trumps new tax bill giving money to the wealthy.  Now due to your buddy stocks are tanking.  Thx to the GOP
3970 2018-03-02 23:11:55 Didn’t steel stocks go up?
3971 2018-03-02 23:10:52 Money money money from a tax cut that is..... that’s why I say dump all gun stocks .. look to Blackrock
3972 2018-03-02 23:10:10 Stocks tumble... Even Trump can't fuck up the crypto currency market.
3973 2018-03-02 23:09:58 Oh yeah returns won't be killing your dad's income or anything but the best part about crypto is not needing to have like a $1000 account like a lot of stocks. You can jump in and learn with like 20 bucks. Crazy opportunity for a kid who wants to learn & get ahead

3975 2018-03-02 23:09:04 If bump stocks are banned and the minimum long gun purchase age is raised will Trump get any credit?
3976 2018-03-02 23:08:35 Trump is crickets on the stock market which is reacting negatively to his childish musings and impulses. Better check to see if his family dumped steel and aluminum stocks recently.
3977 2018-03-02 23:08:34 Does he have stocks in these companies?
3978 2018-03-02 23:08:33 I’m pissed that my penny stocks are skyrocketing while my blue chip stocks are tanking
3979 2018-03-02 23:08:14 To Cartier Worth, 

The sell recommendation on Boeing, is that similar to the sell recommendation you made on NVDIA when it was at $120.00. You always seem to be too negative, and never believe stocks can go higher. Just remember a broken clock is right twice a day
3980 2018-03-02 23:08:01 Mini 14 can also use 5.56 rounds. Has many upgradable parts,such as stocks and muzzle breaks and extended magazines. So yeah,pretty much same thing. It was a nice try though...It shouldn’t be too difficult to do a couple minutes googling before you reply to a gun post next time.
3981 2018-03-02 23:07:33 About HG Infra #IPO . If u get the #stock for anywhere less than 270 bucks/piece, I think it can be bought for the long term. #stocks #InvestorsAnonymous #trading
3982 2018-03-02 23:07:18 I have a better idea they should put them in stocks on St Stephens Green and we pay Euro for rotten fruit which we can throw at them. All the money raised goes to homeless charities and the event is televised.
3983 2018-03-02 23:06:52 And Germany?!? ..I better read up!

They should be sitting pretty right now w focus on Italian Banks, that don’t have a dime to their name.
3984 2018-03-02 23:06:44 Dont stick with liquid stocks at all

3987 2018-03-02 23:05:56 @igorvolsky now imagine them doing the same with their fossil fuel stocks.....
3988 2018-03-02 23:04:54 What happens to the middle class when they aspire to become part of that 10%? If you work hard and earn big are you now despised? You beguile the nature of money and stocks @RonWyden it isn't like there is a limited amount of either.
3989 2018-03-02 23:03:54 I am for banning those and bump stocks and huge clips - those are NOT used for hunting by any serious sportsman Hunter. Those are military look a likes and all you have to do to make them full auto I'd file off the sear. Ask David Koresh - that's what they were doing to make$
3990 2018-03-02 23:03:51 Appears you are also giving a heads up to 45’s friends before you do it so they can sell off their stocks...
3991 2018-03-02 23:03:36 “Good idea, but no $ in it for me”
3992 2018-03-02 23:02:24 There you go!!!! Lightweight. Why shouldn’t grown ups enjoy the snow too?! Think of the awesome stories you can tell in the office on Monday! They’ll be well jel.
3993 2018-03-02 23:01:28 I got rid of my SPYG stocks since they down right now smh this could be a smart move or dumb we shall see
3994 2018-03-02 22:59:57 You know, it takes two to inside trade. One to dump stocks after been given information before a decision is announced that would adversely affect a stock’s value and one to give the information before announcement to raise tariffs is made. 
3995 2018-03-02 22:59:55 Is there some reason you have a problem with capitalism?
When you increase the money supply through economic activity there is more money to go around
People get raises
Stocks increase
It's a real win-win!
3996 2018-03-02 22:59:37 This type of talk is what people joke about in the OTC, it is often a pipe dream because most stocks are not backed by investment banks with the fire power to actually do this. 

Boustead gave fire from .01 to .10 and I think Maxim has the bank roll to  take this to nasdaq/nyse.
3997 2018-03-02 22:58:29 If you just a little bit of brain matter you would realize we don't care about the discounts that only 13 ppl used in past 5 years as reported.
We care they claim they don't pick sides while they denounce us and support PP.  Which is fine, there stocks are dropping
3998 2018-03-02 22:58:15 IMPORTANT, Preview of Monday’s Algo:

If Italian Elections go well, BUY US EQUITIES
If Italian Elections go poorly, FLIGHT TO SAFETY IN US EQUITIES BUY STOCKS

Thank you enjoy your weekend.
3999 2018-03-02 22:57:36 Downright SWAMPY!
4000 2018-03-02 22:57:13 Newsagent nr my mum stocks one copy of the Graun per day. When I went to stay with her, she said 'I wanted to get you your paper, but they didn't have it so I got this.' It was a Mail.
4001 2018-03-02 22:57:08 Right, what do you think of Ichan? Trumps friend who dumper 32 million worth of steel stocks before trump announced the tariffs? Is that ok too? Or Kushner, getting the Saudis to put sanctions on Qatar because they wouldn't make him a loan?
4002 2018-03-02 22:56:46 Trump baited them.....plain and simple. Just like he did them with DACA.

ban on bump stocks and fixing NICS is all I believe we will see , Maybe something on age limits. Democrats have not worked in good faith with him since election . I just don't see him bending that far left.
4003 2018-03-02 22:56:31 Do they also want to ban auto rapid fire multi-clip barrels?  And nitro-trigger assault stocks? It all sounds so scary.
4004 2018-03-02 22:56:21 Funny that your buddy sold off millions in steel stock last week, then you announce tariffs that make the stocks tank. Guess we'll add insider trading to the list of treason, collusion, and money laundering.

4010 2018-03-02 22:54:24 Collecting the dividend makes sense. Any company could fail in a economic crisis if gov fails to act. Non-dividend stocks pure #speculation
4011 2018-03-02 22:54:08 NOPE! No bump stocks! Our President is banning those evil thingamajabberwahkies! But they should be made to walk and swim wherever they’re going because airliners took down the Twin Towers!
4012 2018-03-02 22:52:13 Interesting video.  Trump is a negotiator, and will get things done.  I  don't see stronger background checks or ban on bump stocks bands as infringing on my 2A rights.  I don't think he'll end up pushing for a ban on AR15 though.  Age limit is debatable.
4013 2018-03-02 22:51:34 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now #GunReformNow
4014 2018-03-02 22:51:20 Hell is just a convenience store that only stocks lite tampons
4015 2018-03-02 22:51:12 Bump stocks do not increase the cyclic rate of a firearm.  Example:  AR-15 cyclic rate @600 rounds per minute.   M-4 cyclic rate @900 rounds per minute.   Bump stocks do not make a semi-auto weapon fire even close to the speed of full auto.   FACT.

4020 2018-03-02 22:49:01 Anyone else bored of it??
4021 2018-03-02 22:48:11 Why ask what we want to do if you are just going to say it won't work? We never had these issues until the powerful AR-15 flooded the markets. Start there. Raise the age to get a gun. Comprehensive background checks. Smaller magazines. No bump stocks. What are your ideas?
4022 2018-03-02 22:47:53 I just wish we’d learn to close players down quickly and press further up the field.  We made a long ball team look like Man City at times

4028 2018-03-02 22:46:23 In other @NRA news the @FloridaGOP  has bucked under to NRA and is dropping provisions banning Bump Stocks, 21 age limit and something else I can't remember, The Fla Legislature needs to remember #TheResistanceVotes2018, it's not just kids you're up against.
4029 2018-03-02 22:46:09 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now. These things are only for killing people

4034 2018-03-02 22:44:39 And now we find out that a friend of the sitting prezzy sold off steel related stocks just two weeks before the announcement. Timely profit of over 30 million. Coincidence?

4038 2018-03-02 22:42:45 I’m not sure about that 
4039 2018-03-02 22:42:18 Happy to attend mate. Would love to. Gotta be better than the garbage in North Derbyshire every fortnight!!
4040 2018-03-02 22:42:10 @EricRWeinstein fan of the intellectual dark web, odd question but given the market sell-off, I'm curious, what are your top 5 favorite long term stocks and/or investment trends you like?
4041 2018-03-02 22:42:02 I'm seeing block buying in the last 2 days in oil and energy names, and I think DXY is being smashed to prop up stocks... be careful out there, extreme COT positions can always get more extreme, no one expected oil to get from 42 to 66 in six months as they kept referencing COT
4042 2018-03-02 22:41:10 Oh he will, when the stocks get low enough
4043 2018-03-02 22:40:54 The talking heads on @CNN and @MSNBC @FOX fake news should look at who owns and who buys these stocks that tank when Trump speaks and suddenly rise when Trump changes mind
4044 2018-03-02 22:40:49 My issue entirely mate. Studio pundits spouting incorrect law when giving "opinions" to the watching millions. These millions hang on every word and believe the former "legend" player and then become more ignorant of the LOTG themselves. You can't make it up!!
4045 2018-03-02 22:40:31 Well the president is talking about raising the age to 21 to buy a gun, closing loopholes you're purchasing guns at gun shows, Banning bump stocks. I think he's doing a hell of a lot more than past presidents.
4046 2018-03-02 22:40:15 Very true but on another night they get that goal on the 93rd min. Andys coming to a game with us. So we can see it from a refs eye 
4047 2018-03-02 22:40:12 I concur. Trump is tried that. But will the left listen? He banned bump stocks, is trying to get legal age to purchase firearm to 21.. isn’t that compromise?
4048 2018-03-02 22:39:51 Get your money out of the banks and stocks before its too late
4049 2018-03-02 22:39:32 They think, “that won’t happen to me I’m smarter, I will get it faster, I won’t lose” , those people have the most to learn. So much irony. If someone started trading cuz they want to see why and how stocks move, imagine how much better that dude would be with mental prep.
4050 2018-03-02 22:39:27 Oh, I think they'll do a few Americans a lot of good. Americans like Carl Icahn, who dumped all his steel stocks just a few days before the tariffs were announced. #InsiderTrading
4051 2018-03-02 22:39:27 Good thing your buddy sold his stocks, huh?
4052 2018-03-02 22:39:26 But his friend, Carl Ican, made big money selling off his aluminum & steel stocks days before Trump announced the new policy.
4053 2018-03-02 22:39:21 I would have more oversight on NICS to ensure every state and entity that is supposed to report to it does so more regularly.  I would make it mandatory that gun shows have a booth for background checks that buyers have to pay for before buying a gun.  Ban bump stocks.
4054 2018-03-02 22:39:16 The point of criticizing “um actually” is that the semantics don’t matter- I am aware that unmodified civilian assault rifles are pretty much just scary stocks and magnum rounds, but y’all often complain about non-issues.
4055 2018-03-02 22:39:15 i don’t understand how its a style lmfao. all it is is stocks from bonfire pack and i got i got the melc pic off google
4056 2018-03-02 22:39:05 100% not blaming the ref’s. It’s a group effort. Tv is helping with having ref’s on that punditry teams however They need to do more to educate fans and pundits (especially Robbie savage) loads of law changes last two seasons. Barely mentioned

4059 2018-03-02 22:38:19 Trump is purposely driving down the stock market on key stocks so his friends can buy low and when Trump changes his mind the stocks increase at great profit.WHERE IS THE INVESTIGATION
4060 2018-03-02 22:38:17 I'm not sure what a letter would do. They can't control what's in the indexes that most of their funds follow. At most, they could get their active managers to unload thier 4% of guns stocks that are in non-index funds.
4061 2018-03-02 22:38:05 I was -1.8% again mid afternoon. My US stocks pulled this back, Netflix my hero again. Regretting selling #BGO, nice mini rally going on there.

4065 2018-03-02 22:35:38 Rs in NY state Senate blocked efforts by Democrats Wednesday to force a vote on 4 gun control bills to strengthen background checks & fund research into gun violence, ban bump stocks & give courts ability to seize guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others
4066 2018-03-02 22:35:29 Values for sale? Maybe not, stocks? Most likely.
4067 2018-03-02 22:35:19 I feel like if Trump can move the markets with a tweet that he’s doing some insider trading to make a profit. Tweet something stupid - stocks go down   Then he buys low and tweets something to raise them and sell high. Easy money.
4068 2018-03-02 22:34:27 I think it could be intereresting but stocks will drop.
4069 2018-03-02 22:34:12 but his buddies that dumped their steel stocks knew. He's been manipulating the markets for rmonths now. Look at "failing Boeing" tweet last year. Boeing stock went on sale with one tweet.
4070 2018-03-02 22:34:05 We don't need to ban bump stocks. We just need to rename them Trump  stocks. They'll file for bankruptcy before you know it.
4071 2018-03-02 22:33:45 I’m attending your next meeting. You guys are refereeing a different game to what we are watching. I’ve never known it this bad and confusing

4073 2018-03-02 22:33:27 On a side note i do agree there are unfair regualtions that are bad for small bussinesses and unfair such as how the corperate tax rate is 20% but the the tax rate for buying and selling stocks is 15% which is just bullshit. It should be the other way around.

4081 2018-03-02 22:32:01 .@realdonaldtrump "surprise" announcement of #Aluminum #Tarrifs was only told to a handful of his billionaire buddies so they could dump stocks to profit from the market drop. No one in @WhiteHouse or #GOP leadership knew. That's how the rich steal from the poor. #TrumpCorruption
4082 2018-03-02 22:31:21 Here’s a suggestion:
Ban bump stocks
Ban AR15
Reduce magazine size
Require insurance on guns
Require training with guns
Require a license to buy a gun
Raise the minimum age to own any gun to 21
4083 2018-03-02 22:31:16 @SRuhle pls investigate whether Wilbur Ross, industry execs and/or friends and family took any big positions in steel and aluminum stocks in past week. Could be big-time insider trading scandal.
4084 2018-03-02 22:31:14 We’ll finish 15th #ComfortableSlippers
4085 2018-03-02 22:31:09 Great pic. It's like, "I don't always dump $30 million in steel stocks. But when I do, it's because of an insider tip from Washington." He is...the most interesting white collar criminal in the world.
4086 2018-03-02 22:31:05 #netflix $nflx, one of the greatest stocks I have ever seen, though, let’s be real, this thing is overblown. Does it retest low 200’s? Quite possibly.
4087 2018-03-02 22:31:00 I think Esg, or something like stripping out gun stocks could be the catalyst that gives direct indexing a major growth opportunity over etfs.

4092 2018-03-02 22:29:37 High stocks do NOT mean we are doing well. It means CEOs are doing well. It means the corporations are doing well. This does NOT mean the Everyman is doing well.
4093 2018-03-02 22:29:31 Some companies are giving a 1x bonus, so what? Misdirection to distract that most of the $$$ is used for buybacks of stocks. It means the trickle down which didn't happen under Reagan, is not happening under @realDonaldTrump, no matter how @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr spin it
4094 2018-03-02 22:29:22 He sold stocks in a company that USES steel.
4095 2018-03-02 22:29:18 Normal service resumed for us, struggling with relegation and Financial difficulties! 
4096 2018-03-02 22:29:14 I don't have a problem with the ban on bump stocks but messing with anything else doesn't seem right and it's so sad that these young children are being played by the Liberals and the Democrats
4097 2018-03-02 22:28:58 Seems like you’ve been working for Putin the whole time.
4098 2018-03-02 22:28:54 Yes and Ross is in the steel and textiles industries. He stands to make a ton of money. Trump has influenced markets by announcing early. Stocks plummet and scooped up by his friends. Insider trading?
4099 2018-03-02 22:28:37 Would VAR have overruled the ref?? 
4100 2018-03-02 22:28:12 Haha I know Mate, and the likes of Man Utd

4104 2018-03-02 22:26:37  we would of been in administration if Chansiri didn't take over?? So we are just in same situation. 
4105 2018-03-02 22:26:33 Icahn dumped all his steel dependent stocks after Feb 12.  You guys don't even bother hiding corruption anymore.
4106 2018-03-02 22:26:17 Not me I was stocks and pelted, but have hardened my stance to random truck just so he can say "I did not see it" one last time ! 
4107 2018-03-02 22:26:17 Then his timing sucks, or he chose not to benefit from insider knowledge.  My steel stocks are up 15% since the announcement of tariffs.
4108 2018-03-02 22:25:15 Share kita trish ng stocks ko. Overloaded ako ng gnyan dito s cp ko. Tanda mo ung may Johnsons baby powder pang background s kama?
4109 2018-03-02 22:25:15 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It appears that people who support you have been liquidating their stocks in the last few weeks. Did you clue them in on your plan to impose tariffs and taxes?  Appears to be the case.
4110 2018-03-02 22:24:08 Just met with bank’s investment woman. Stocks, bonds, RRSPs, equities, registered, unregistered etc. FFS I’m more confused than before. I just want  to keep cash in a fiddle case like granny did!
4111 2018-03-02 22:23:19 Im lightly invested in to 10 companies... Like VERY lightly.. And idk all of them together havw been holding well.. Theres not just 1. Stocks are always a risk.
4112 2018-03-02 22:23:18 Just concentrate on your own club pal!  #Boro 
4113 2018-03-02 22:23:01 Although our defender plays at it? He does not deliberately pass it to the striker therefore offside. The laws fucked start again it back to the original rule. It shouldn’t be this hard mate (giggity) your jobs are a hard enough (giggity)
4114 2018-03-02 22:22:54 Qua Stocks @quastocks finishes 2nd Place in High Jump at #NAIATrack national meet! First Indoor All-American for Reinhardt!
4115 2018-03-02 22:22:44 If your guy nearest the initial shot gets a touch in an attempt to block it and it goes through to the Boro lad THEN it's offside as it's classed as a deflection and not a deliberate attempt e.g. Trying to stick it in Row Z
4116 2018-03-02 22:22:20 You’re losing ur support from the ppl who elected u. Bump stocks has a faster recoil but it’s not accurate. It’s spray & pray.  U should be enforcing laws we already have. Not making new 1’s every time something happens. That’s an oppty 4 libs. That’s all.
4117 2018-03-02 22:22:11 So Carl Icahn dumped $31.3 million in steel related stocks. Days later the Grifter announces his intention of imposing tariffs on steel imports. Sounds like insiders trading to me. @LindseyGrahamSC @OrrinHatch Where’s the SEC oh that’s right Carl Icahn is part of the team.
4118 2018-03-02 22:22:10 I'm putting it all together Frank. Such a shame that all Pat wanted to do was get his 3 companies assets on books so he could leverage them to help build up &increase shareholders value & NOT use toxic financing like so many other OTC stocks. Assets for $PDXP $VICT & $CHIT LEGIT
4119 2018-03-02 22:21:35 So why did tech stocks dip and recover at 5:15pm EST today?
4120 2018-03-02 22:21:17 The dreaded "second phase" mate. Have a glance through the screenshots I sent with my last tweet. 2nd phase isn't mentioned but on the 2nd page of the two it describes why he then becomes onside after a deliberate attempt by your man to play the ball.
4121 2018-03-02 22:21:11 except those who short stocks.
4122 2018-03-02 22:21:03 What she’s saying is contrary to his actions. He has been kissing ass from day 1. Talking about emails not being handled securely and his staff isn’t secure. Stocks plunging, reds controlling votes, WH not secure, he’s unglued. Wag the dog PT.2
4123 2018-03-02 22:20:55 Famine? Your history is out if whack. We had record harvests in the summer and fall of 1929. That's why prices fell. Farmers had financed more land or equipment. That debt and  "margin trading" in stocks combined with the FED reducing money supply contributed more than any tariff
4124 2018-03-02 22:20:20 Comfy slippers of 14th place
4125 2018-03-02 22:19:45 When you say “R” for resources, do you mean energy and material company stocks like Exxon, $eog, or the actual commodity like oil?
Also, what do you mean by media, $DIS, $NFLX?
4126 2018-03-02 22:19:33 Oh he played at it or sure, where I’m confused is why does that matter? Is stood offside wonhqs gained that advantage. He was In that position when the ball was struck. By scoring he was Clearly interfering with play..all strikers might as well stay offside
4127 2018-03-02 22:19:30 Probably a really good time rn to buy stocks in guns
4128 2018-03-02 22:19:15 When a president's golf buddies are guilty of insider trading on dumping steel stocks before his announcement, who is he calling at 4:30am?
4129 2018-03-02 22:19:04 $SRO - One of my most disappointing stocks, it’s ended up a total basket case for me so far, but flip side to that, I hope you can make some cash on a trade n break up good luck 
4130 2018-03-02 22:18:11 No one wanna write about all the mutual fund managers who kept buying stocks last year in advance of the tax bill?
4131 2018-03-02 22:18:10 I remember my husband telling me the day the Gov introduced his package "watch them pare it down to a ban on bump stocks". So angry and exhausted.
4132 2018-03-02 22:18:09 DJIA -70.92 represents 30 companies and a decline of less than 1/3 of 1%.  S&P up 1/2 of 1%, Nasdaq composite +1.08% and Russell 2000 +1.71% representing about 5500 US common stocks together.  Don't get your knickers in a bunch over the "Dow's divergence" or "underperformance."
4133 2018-03-02 22:16:46 Because they're being paid by the gov. to make sure we're deaf. Once we're deaf we will need hearing aids. Thus, the stocks in the hearing aid companies will skyrocket, and we will be owned by them as their money fills the pockets of politicians. Conclusion: play indie games.
4134 2018-03-02 22:16:40 FTSE 100 up a mind blowing 9% over the last 5 years.

4138 2018-03-02 22:14:40 Not just that, obviously there are price hikes for every business that uses raw steel, but also a knock on effect for every other business who deals with them, and with them, etc etc, plus all the money now being pulled out of US stocks and put somewhere better.
4139 2018-03-02 22:14:05 $DDD $AOBC Two great “value” stocks that likely put in a bottom and looks like great medium/long term buy.
4140 2018-03-02 22:13:57 Which defender, describe in the pic?
4141 2018-03-02 22:13:46 So the rich can get richer as stocks and shares plummet , poor get poorer as we will be worse off than staying in the EU.Privatise the NHS(America waiting in the wings) ,cut workers rights, pay and holidays ...slippery slope to a Britain of more Austerity.
4142 2018-03-02 22:13:33 Always with the reflections, never caring how it will affect American or Americans. Unless that was his point to affect the stock market so his friends can benefit from shorting stocks. Disgraceful!
4143 2018-03-02 22:12:57 Hope he doesn't sell off his jet fuel stocks
4144 2018-03-02 22:12:55 Are you serious? Why don’t you check their stance on every one of them since the 90’s when they began happening more and more.  Show me a response that does not promote selling more weapons.  Bump stocks lol
4145 2018-03-02 22:12:53 Just looks like more stock manipulation. He says one thing stocks go up he says another stocks go down. He says one thing gun sales go up he says another thing gun sales taper off
4146 2018-03-02 22:12:47 Yes but it took a deflection, ‘played at’ by our defender
4147 2018-03-02 22:12:05 Did Kusher buy a bunch of put options on steel stocks?
4148 2018-03-02 22:11:49 Indeed! Any poor microscope practice requires a day in the stocks!
4149 2018-03-02 22:11:47 Special report “ stocks on businesses have gone down after cutting ties with the NRA plus big loss of revenue “
4150 2018-03-02 22:11:38 Yep. Tax cuts, lowest unemployment in 40 years, stocks all time high, ICE in action, decrease in gangs, companies coming back to USA , Foreign investments up. I know..hard to believe he can do all that in one year in spite of all the hatred you spew 24/7
4151 2018-03-02 22:10:12 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4152 2018-03-02 22:10:09 Global carmakers stand out as likely victims given their use of steel and aluminium and reliance on complicated cross-border supply chains. The stocks of leading US blue-chip companies that depend on extensive global sales such as Caterpillar and Boeing have also been hurt. FT
4153 2018-03-02 22:09:54 America. I suppose all of you Trumpkins saved MILLION$, as did Carl Icahn, by dumping your steel stocks before Trump's bs about tariffs. Oh, your 401(k) got slammed? Your tax cut has disappeared? Sad. Grifter's gotta grift. 1/2
4154 2018-03-02 22:09:15 All my tech stocks raged higher today. Money will be coming into this sector now. Unaffected by dumb ass trade policies.
4155 2018-03-02 22:09:08 Why is the input of the @NRA, a minority of the voting population and population at large, more important to you & Congress than the majority of the public? The majority want gun control-ban AR-15 sales, ban bump stocks, raise age limits, stronger checks, better data, etc.
4156 2018-03-02 22:08:54 2/2 If we aren't going to put measure in place to identify the bad guy, we take away his tools. I don't believe bump stocks, assault weapons or large capacity magazines existed when the 2nd amendment was drafted. Times change. Rules must as well.

4159 2018-03-02 22:08:23 Well, stocks worthless, thanks @realDonaldTrump.  Only took 9 years to recover from 2008.  Here we go again.
4160 2018-03-02 22:08:10 If we "win Big" why are stocks falling? Must have missed that course at Wharton?
4161 2018-03-02 22:07:30 Yes. Had you known, you also could have dumped your millions in steel stocks. Too late now.
4162 2018-03-02 22:07:22 And most of all companies buying their stocks
4163 2018-03-02 22:07:21 I also noted that many of the stocks that got especially hammered in '08 also did so in early 2000's which was the previous bear.
4164 2018-03-02 22:06:38 I take it no. 11 scored off the shot coming in?
4165 2018-03-02 22:05:55 Wanna put money down that his broker sold stocks in steel and metals the day before the announcement was made? Waiting for them to tank and will buy them back cheap just before he says something that makes values jump again
4166 2018-03-02 22:05:47 And I want to know more about Carl Icahn selling off steel-related stocks before this announcement.  Drain the swamp?  Right.  Drain the treasury.
4167 2018-03-02 22:05:37 Consumers refuse to pay the new .10 for bags but you think they won't mind .03 to every food & beverage can!! Plus #Taxbill is pushing inflation too fast, raising interest rates faster. Trump tanking stocks w/tweets ALL = new recession!!!
4168 2018-03-02 22:05:19 And unfortunately, long-short value is also challenged because spreads are compressed using all meaningful measures. The most expensive stocks are relatively cheap, and the cheapest stocks are relatively expensive.
4169 2018-03-02 22:04:59 Performing much better than the my stocks and funds over the last 3 years...
4170 2018-03-02 22:04:16 What gun control advocates want to ban are semi-automatic weapons which take intermediate-power cartridges with pistol/ front grips, threaded barrels, barrel shroud and telescoping/ folding stocks. 2/
4171 2018-03-02 22:04:11 And make necessary changes. To be clear, non criminals should have access to guns, but I'm opposed to the sale of AR-15, AK47s, high powered rifles, bump stocks, etc. Unless you are in the military, you don't need them. Peace!!!

4179 2018-03-02 22:03:12 Sorry I wasn't clear. No, long-only value can only "come into favor" from here if the cheapest stocks become much cheaper, which would of course compress the value premium in the short-term.
4180 2018-03-02 22:02:37 Surely American steel stocks should rise?

4201 2018-03-02 21:58:35 I really hate the combine. Nothing really comes out of it other than some stocks rise and others fall and it doesn't translate anything to the real NFL. I also hate all the rumors, are the Dolphins really looking QB or just blowing smoke up everyones rear end? lol

4212 2018-03-02 21:54:19 Has the SEC been alerted yet? I wonder if there were any more who dumped their stocks?
4213 2018-03-02 21:54:01 Your measures fall short. Measures must include 1) Raising the age to buy guns, or at least assault weapons, to 21, 2) Closing the "gun show" loophole, ensuring all gun purchases are subject to a background check, 3) Banning bump stocks, 4) keeping guns from the mentally ill.
4214 2018-03-02 21:53:38 Stocks are slipping and trump is unhinged
4215 2018-03-02 21:53:36 Assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines are only for killing people. No law abiding citizen needs they tools of murder
4216 2018-03-02 21:53:18 More so with the stocks.. Last months numbers came out, GCI (global Cannabis Index) dropped almost 30% last month... And a bunch of big Canadian Corps are acquiring growers and production companies..... Just a teeny bit of info.
4217 2018-03-02 21:53:09 No, Media, do your job, find out what was really behind this. Ross is all for it (he's being investigated for insider tagging in UK) Icahn makes a fortune selling off stocks a week before the announcement. This was likely illegal market manipulation. Do ur job.
4218 2018-03-02 21:53:01 Wittman refuses to meet with constituents. Another day goes by that @RobWittman failed to introduce a bill to ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks; and to improve background checks. Vote him out.  More @washingtonpost
4219 2018-03-02 21:52:47 Can't wait to see this one....
4220 2018-03-02 21:52:10 they did not even answer the first time. they “auto answer” emails, social media, etc.. same as every other big corporation!! you honestly think someone is sitting answering these?! & this incident happened awhile ago.. the man above should sell his stocks!!
4221 2018-03-02 21:51:54 For long-only managers, what matters is valuations in the tail. In 2000, while the average stock was expensive, and the most expensive stocks were obscenely expensive, the cheapest stocks were somewhat attractive. Now there are just no cheap stocks.
4222 2018-03-02 21:51:51 The losers will be the globalists that sell their stocks in fear of a trade war when the US economy is strong and jobs are coming back.  Oops.  I guess you don't have a good mind for business.
4223 2018-03-02 21:51:51 Places like Home Depot have stocks that are essentially the same at most of their stores over an entire region. But a small nursery directly on the coast vs one here on Pasadena will have plants that reflect the huge climatic differences between the 2 areas.
4224 2018-03-02 21:50:13 That's what's great about the guy.

He has been and remains a free-agent.

And whether Congress agrees to things like limiting bump stocks and age limits for semiautomatics, they aren't the ones with the Republican voters' attention.
4225 2018-03-02 21:50:09 So I’m pretty confident this is stock manipulation. All his buddies sold high and are probably buying low. He will end up reversing his decision and stocks will go back up.
4226 2018-03-02 21:50:04 No AR15s! No weapons of war! No high capacity magazines. No bump stocks! Full background checks for ALL gun sales! 21 years or older!
4227 2018-03-02 21:50:03 I’m not feeling well and I almost panic sold all my stocks lmao.
4228 2018-03-02 21:49:26 A great deal maker would get them to charge us less, not charge them more at the expense of industry and consumers.  BAD DEAL!  Good deal for your rich buddies who sold their stocks though, huh?  Can you say 'insider trading' boys and girls?
4229 2018-03-02 21:49:14 Some in White House staff will  sell their grandma for a fast buck.
It does not surprise some selling or buying stocks in steel companies before the Tariff on steel imports was announced.    A trade war is inevitable becoz no nation even Mexico can take it lying down.
4230 2018-03-02 21:49:14 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines.  Forget the NRA do it now reality TV star
4231 2018-03-02 21:48:12 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
4232 2018-03-02 21:47:36 Sorry Archer, I’ve been at sea  for the last 3 weeks, haven’t had reception for most of that, but I’m back now and looking to top up a few positions in stocks and crypto, my overall portfolio is still in good shape and in profit $$$ (diversification is the key)
4233 2018-03-02 21:47:23 @MTPDailyTweets What's with Trump's friend Carl Icahn dumping his stocks containing steel the other day? Add Insider Trading to Trump's list of felonies.
4234 2018-03-02 21:47:19 @TDAmeritrade @TDAJJKinahan - Not happy with ThinkorSwim clunky trading platform for stocks. Requires separate windows open just to see stocks, positions & charts at same time. The tab for your positions is named "None" (!) WTF? - Lost too much money trading with TOS. Watch out
4235 2018-03-02 21:46:46 One of his buds dumped steel stocks last week.
4236 2018-03-02 21:45:45 When it’s not about bump stocks, it’s about forcing boys into the girl’s bathrooms.It’s about pushing PC politics down the throats of Americans using unelected Corporations as proxies for the Collectivist Left.
4237 2018-03-02 21:45:27 They oppose expanding background checks, raising age limit, and banning bump stocks. They have no interest in helping prevent tragedy if it affects their $$$. Right now essentially any gun can be in any hands and they won't fight to change anything.

4241 2018-03-02 21:44:18 #tonighttv3 #vinb As now often on a Friday night after imploding stock markets, the Fed steps in and - without checks & balances - takes taxpayers money to pump up stocks for w/e.

4252 2018-03-02 21:42:18 Bump stocks banned in MA, no grandfather provisions. All 3 were turned in... as a result mass shootings were reduced by... still zero
4253 2018-03-02 21:42:10 Cry baby globalist.  Sell you stocks and let the nationalists buy low.  Your loss.
4254 2018-03-02 21:42:08 All for show. Great photo ops. In the end, I'd be surprised if they remove bump-stocks.
  Nothing more than a distraction. He obviously needs all he can get at this point.

In yesterday’s market action, steel stocks gained $2 billion in market cap. 
Also in yesterday’s market action, the S&P 500 lost $350 billion in market cap.
4263 2018-03-02 21:40:11 there are a ton of stocks that look good from 2009 to now...that's because the market has been almost straight up from 2009 to now...it's good to pay attention to what happened before 2009 because we'll eventually see another bear market
4264 2018-03-02 21:40:00 One difficult stock market lesson to learn is to buy *more* of your best stocks -- buy more of your winners. Naturally, keep allocations in mind, but averaging up in winners will trounce averaging down in losers, I can almost guarantee it (no guarantees in life, or else I would).

4268 2018-03-02 21:38:48 most folks don't have stocks or even 401ks ...most folks are worried about wages rising costs of living day to day ..a so called billionaire is concerned with stocks and shares

4270 2018-03-02 21:38:31 And like that, back in the saddle, Jay. Naz up two Friday’s in a row. I sat fully invested last few days and was rewarded. Unfortunately the stocks I wanted to play made 22% and 10% respectively and my largest real holding was up only 3%. Figures.  lol. Good luck next week Jay
4271 2018-03-02 21:37:49 Maybe @realDonaldTrump DOES want to ban Assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks!    We can hope.
4272 2018-03-02 21:37:47 These stocks need to become as toxic as South African stocks in the days of apartheid. Let the tRumpian army buy up all the stocks that ethical funds dump.
4273 2018-03-02 21:37:46 Earnings boost for stocks may lose luster with rising yields
4274 2018-03-02 21:37:45 It would definitely do "dick shit" Bump stocks added to AR-15 increase fire rate and these laws would discourage anyone who doesnt want to go through the process. To be clear, I want those restrictions on all weapons, common sense to know how to use what you're buying
4275 2018-03-02 21:37:19 If I was a southsider I would seriously object to that outrageous chatacterisation... particularly at a time like this, when quinoa stocks are at critical levels. For shame.
4276 2018-03-02 21:36:10 I just don't understand Americans some time. Levelling the trade field by adding tariff's to Aluminum and Steel will get us more competitive! Why not buy stocks in those manufacturers and invest in the American future along with your own?? @TeamCavuto
4277 2018-03-02 21:35:25 Take note: 

Banks losing money through a Russian “loan” schemes + inflated stocks of big business = bust of 2007.
4278 2018-03-02 21:35:23 s&p 500 is being propped up by proposed stock buybacks. That's a shaky leg for the entire US economy to stand on. The entire world is in the red today. Companies don't buyback stocks when they are in the green.

4281 2018-03-02 21:33:49 Hey, is your friend Carl Ichan sharing with you his mega profits from dumping $30+ million in steel-related stocks? If not, perhaps you should insist on your cut up front.
4282 2018-03-02 21:33:24 The @ADCAshfield staff who run the festival hall should be ashamed tonight. @GiveBloodNHS session booked and the hall was so cold it had to be cancelled. Staff had to bring their own heating in. Disgusting when stocks are so low. Lots of frustrated staff and donors

4284 2018-03-02 21:33:05 After slipping early, stocks gained back ground today, as banks and tech firms cut losses and pulled broader indexes higher.
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was roughly flat in afternoon trading, after falling by more than 1 percent early in the day.
4285 2018-03-02 21:32:55 Icahn fortuitously dumping steel stocks is as much a coincidence as @realDonaldTrump’s winning the 2016 election.
4286 2018-03-02 21:32:43 LMAO
4287 2018-03-02 21:32:19 News told me stocks were going to plummet today. My S&P500 ETF is up 1% today. This happened election night too, go figure.
4288 2018-03-02 21:32:14 World stocks ex-US tumble: S&P 500 +.5%; Europe -2.1%. Trump ignorance of devestation to world economy of a trade war frightened foreign markets. US escaped for today but next week will be different if he continues on this path.
4289 2018-03-02 21:32:09 I think we need to do signficantly more than make bump stocks illegal.  100% of gun sales need a background check.  The background check system needs overhaul.  Large cap mags need to be outlawed, etc.
4290 2018-03-02 21:31:34 But his friends sold their stocks last week.
4291 2018-03-02 21:31:28 Struck out with the bump stocks, huh?
4292 2018-03-02 21:31:23 @LLBean   Great move, LL Bean!  Could you now stop selling ARs and bump stocks too (if part of your inventory)?

4296 2018-03-02 21:29:21 What? Who took away the 5th?  As far as taking guns away I really don’t believe that it will be done. Maybe bump stocks and trigger cranks but that is fine with me.  Fix NICS and that’s about it.
4297 2018-03-02 21:29:10 Do EpiPens have optional bump-stocks? Only for kids though..
4298 2018-03-02 21:29:00 The number of people killed by bump stocks is not statistically significant.
4299 2018-03-02 21:28:56 I only watch stocks trading above $100 and making all time highs.
4300 2018-03-02 21:28:45 Last couple of months watching you buy and sell positions and your explanation behind these decisions has been fantastic. Really hits home how the reality of not being wedded to your stocks works and to just get out but not be afraid to keep on trying to get back in.
4301 2018-03-02 21:28:40 It will be very interesting to see if sell algos once again takes over on Monday or let the market run to resistance again. I think we're in a mini-bear market as most stocks are having problems making new highs. What's scary is that after Mar, seasonality shows weakness.
4302 2018-03-02 21:28:12 So? Make bump stocks illegal. I don't think too many here are arguing against the full auto ban, friend.
4303 2018-03-02 21:27:31 6. Ban assault rifles.
7.  Ban bump stocks.
8. Ban high capacity magazines.
9. Ban body shredding ammo 
10. Universal registration 
11. Raise gun and ammo purchase age to 21
12. Refuse donations from NRA

Grow a pair Marco and add these to your non-plan!!
4304 2018-03-02 21:27:19 And the price of the stocks will tank. Then they can buy it back at bargain basement prices. That’s what they mean by winning.
4305 2018-03-02 21:27:13 Would you say this is a bounce back today? The stocks that I had on Tuesday $CMG and $CRM totally recovered

Apparently, this "plan" of Rubio's is what the NRA's $3mil+ bought them.

Research, P/E, insider trading, dividends?, Book Value, and 10Q also know as the Truth reported to SEC.
4316 2018-03-02 21:24:04 But Icahn just cashed in his steel stocks just days before Trump announced tariffs. Sounds like he got inside information from Trump. It is illegal to trade on that kind of information. Icahn should be investigated for insider trading.
4317 2018-03-02 21:23:39 Trump's buddy Carl Icahn dumped over $1M in steel-related stocks just last week. Im sure that was just a lucky coincidence, right?
4318 2018-03-02 21:23:34 When you have owned the Canadian banks or railways, or stocks like Starbucks for more than 20 years, these blips don’t even show up on the long term graph!
4319 2018-03-02 21:21:28 They had a cow over the 1.8 million Amnesty deal too. President Trump was trolling the dems and they walked away.Looking as if they sold out "Dreamers" Now they want to ban things that "make a gun fire faster" he gave them bump stocks and 21 AR sales. They will walk away again
4320 2018-03-02 21:21:25 After starting down over 200 points, the Dow Jones closed just over 70 points down. For some time it looked like the market was going to be in the green.

4324 2018-03-02 21:20:11 Bump Stocks should not be allowed period. The whole reason for them is to make something you own into something that is illegal to own. Analogy: Taking a real cigarette with a filter and putting marijuana inside. Still a cigarette, and still illegal.

4329 2018-03-02 21:18:51 That was the officer's poor behavior. Had nothing to do with gun control. "Gun free zones" don't stop bad guys with guns. Doing things like raising the age limit to purchase guns and eliminating bump stocks is smart.  Guns do save lives. Ask the police and military.

4334 2018-03-02 21:17:10 Nope.  He got those guns because just about anyone can get them.  He shot hundreds of people because it's easier to get a rifle and large cap mags in Nevada than it is to drive a car.  Buy hey, bump stocks are just all in good fun.
4335 2018-03-02 21:16:23 Carl Ichan Trump’s buddy unloaded 30 million in steel stocks before Trump started a trade war but yes let’s focus on the supposed corruption of private citizens instead of the president.  You’re a complete waste of time but I’m home sick anyway.

4344 2018-03-02 21:14:42 First of all, it will only help their bottom line. The vast majority of the country approve of these companies taking a stand. Their stocks have risen and more people have vowed to patronize these companies.

4347 2018-03-02 21:12:58 One get's ideas occasionally. Rethink your strategy to idolise someone recommending more than 12 stocks a year.

Though 12 is also a stretched limit !!
4348 2018-03-02 21:12:31 He said it was a coincidence he dumped stocks before the tariffs
4349 2018-03-02 21:12:21 $50+ million dollar decision. Shareholders can’t be too happy. If I remember correctly from my one class in college lol, taxes play into common and preferred stocks 
4350 2018-03-02 21:11:20 $IBB $LABU gorgeous candle today... liking biotech stocks over next 2 weeks
4351 2018-03-02 21:10:35 Enlighten us gun owning peasants how universal background checks (with registries), banning one class of firearms, and banning accessories (bumpfire stocks) will stop or slow down someone intent on killing scores of people.
4352 2018-03-02 21:10:15 Bull market in stocks a bit long in the tooth now.
4353 2018-03-02 21:10:01 Regarding #tariff, check #JaredKushner portfolio to see if he and @realDonaldTrump have Steel stocks.

Jared need 1.2 billion for 666 Tower
4354 2018-03-02 21:09:54 Tariffs or buying stocks? It isn’t insider trading and knowing Trump, it is not even speculation. Opening salvo can change immensely at end.
4355 2018-03-02 21:09:11 I’m far from lazy but I am left and am emotional about the senseless death of the innocent. Why do we need semi automatic weapons and bump stocks? Mental illness is on the rise. So better law enforcement. Please explain your approach. Truly want to hear your thoughts.
4356 2018-03-02 21:09:09 Print money. Mail to Wall Street. Stocks higher. It's easy.
4357 2018-03-02 21:07:35 Except to when it comes to bump stocks and items that "increase the rate of fire" of semi auto weapons...ie, lighter triggers, lighter bcg's, etc.
4358 2018-03-02 21:07:17 @wavecounter ,u have yourself a grrrr8t weekend 'cause u are needed to navigate the turmoil - green arrows everyday which is terrific

4360 2018-03-02 21:06:48 Stocks climb from morning lows to end mixed after Thurs. plunge on Trump trade war fears.
Dow -71, -0.3% to 24,538.
But Nasdaq +1.1%, S&P +0.5%.

For the week Dow -3.1%, Nasdaq -1.1%, S&P -2.0%.
4361 2018-03-02 21:06:41 No it is not my type to tell you what I buy. I only feed what I say about stocks I like. But you can view my pictures what I use everyday. Have nice weekend
4362 2018-03-02 21:06:31 Ya have to find out who td is i am on it. Then fuck his stocks up
4363 2018-03-02 21:06:10 Astounding how you can get things so backwards. The stocks crashed because investors know what tariffs do to our economy. 

Trumpanzees are the ones that claimed stocks represented Trump's leadership, even though they rose all thru Obama's admin, and are now downward under Trump.
4364 2018-03-02 21:06:01 Tariffs on steel (1) trash foreign manufacturers' ADRs (American depository receipts, which trade like stocks) and (2) boost U.S. manufacturers' share prices. If you know what's coming, it's an easy way to exploit blithely unwary markets. It's also against the law. 1934 Act § 10.
4365 2018-03-02 21:05:37 Congrats. Again...No stocks.. No Opportunities.  Soon u will know..
4366 2018-03-02 21:05:34 smallcap stocks finished up over 1.7% today

lol
4367 2018-03-02 21:04:38 Where is your promised executive order banning bump stocks? What happened in your meeting with the NRA? Children are DEAD. We need action not childish tweets about an actor. Are you president or a 15-year old girl?
4368 2018-03-02 21:04:32 I think Trump is messing with the stock market.  He announces tariffs on steel and aluminum.  DOW et al. tumble.  He and his friends buy a lot of stock.  He calls off the tariffs, and stocks shoot up.  This COULD be illegal.  Right?
4369 2018-03-02 21:04:27 Trump must have told Carl Icahn he was going to do it. Icahn sold 31 million in steel stocks just before the announcement . Things that make ya go hmm. @robreiner @andrewrsorkin @MaddowBlog
4370 2018-03-02 21:04:17 “Demonized”indicates a perception not based on fact. 7 of the 8 most destructive mass killings involved the AR-15. Time for it to go. Same for bump stocks and large rounds.#BoycottTheNRA #GunReformNow
4371 2018-03-02 21:04:12 @marcorubio you seem to believe to the contrary.  From what I recall you stated you believe bump stocks were already illegal under the current law, but if not you would support legislation to resolve.  Pretty sure #bumpstocks falls under the things that we agree on @ChrisMurphyCT

4378 2018-03-02 21:03:13 @maggieNYT post says Trump buddy Icahn dumped his steel stocks - think that's why Trump made the announcement?

4380 2018-03-02 21:02:37 @jimcramer question,  I have 50 shares of TCEHY As well as many other stocks but wondering if I should sell that and by MU
4381 2018-03-02 21:02:14 So, 1. No time to issue the EO on bump stocks by then I guess. 2. His lawyers argument about not having time to be interviewed in depth is undermined by such activities.
4382 2018-03-02 21:01:27 US stocks rallied back from the weak open to close mixed on the day: $DJIA -72, $SPX +13
4383 2018-03-02 21:01:27 That, or investors think the trade war is negative, so they expect the FED to cut rates now. 
But that means the economy is doing bad, so that means more fiscal stimulus is on the way, which is bullish, so yeah, it does make sense why stocks are closing solidly green JMHO.
4384 2018-03-02 21:01:18 US stocks rallied back from the weak open to close mixed on the day: $DJIA -72, $SPX +13
4385 2018-03-02 21:01:13 But no “insider trading” right? SEC probably should see who sold large blocks of aluminum company stocks in the last couple of weeks. Wonder where Ichan got his info on upcoming tariffs?
4386 2018-03-02 21:00:43 What consequences? Republicans sold US out. I wonder how many Congress critters dumped stocks last week?
4387 2018-03-02 21:00:15 Hedge Fund Director: "Why all these random stocks!?"
Coder: ".....Uhm....uhhhh....'diversification'?"
Hedge Fund Director: "buy NOP at 90 and sell MOV at 89!? Where did you get these numbers"
Coder: "uhm......uhhh.....IDA?"
HFD: "You're fired."
4388 2018-03-02 20:59:59 Dow in the red, Nasdaq, S&P 500 in the green. Strange Friday for the market. All 3 major indexes should be in the red with closing bell to ring in seconds. Why? It's Friday. #Stocks
4389 2018-03-02 20:59:47 Stocks closing solidly green, proving that investors like the prospect of a trade war.
4390 2018-03-02 20:59:30 @CNBCnow Can y'all tell me which CNBC guest (a woman) mentioned CRSP and EDIT as good tech buys. It was sometime around 2/20. These stocks are looking good and I usually keep track of who turned me on to specific names. Thanks.
4391 2018-03-02 20:59:05 The recent 50% rise in stocks since jan probably made twitter less afraid of making a political purge. Good, twitter should die. They already had purge too many people for political reasons.
4392 2018-03-02 20:58:56 'Throw the bums - or A-bump stocks out...
4393 2018-03-02 20:58:36 Stocks, once shunned (10am) are now beloved
4394 2018-03-02 20:58:17 I would really like to know if Trump family members bought stocks heavily before he signed the tax bill and sold heavily before the tariff announcement... and whether they will buy again just before Trump says he’s changed his mind. Cool way to play the markets.
4395 2018-03-02 20:58:04 Congress is going to be voting on banning “semi automatic assault rifles” and bump stocks so yes it is a ban but they are also raising backround checks and making the age of eligibility to 21 so it’s both bud
4396 2018-03-02 20:57:53 Marijuana Stocks Going Green
4397 2018-03-02 20:57:05 Higher the age to 21 ban bump stocks ban AR15s give back NRA money or be voted out!!!
4398 2018-03-02 20:57:01 The only thing you’re concerned about are the share prices for pharmaceutical stocks
4399 2018-03-02 20:56:57 one thing they don't really teach you in school is how protesting is extremely important and it gets things accomplished. those kids got Rubio to change his stance on bump stocks with their protests and confrontations. hell, what do you think happened with the Boston tea party?
4400 2018-03-02 20:56:35 Would not be at all surprised if this practice is more widespread. Behaviour of stocks especially on aim is more than strange.
4401 2018-03-02 20:56:31 Interesting that your good friend dumped 31 million dollars in stocks just in time to keep from losing money after your announcement. Insider trading? Maybe he can be in the same cell that Martha Stewart was in for the same crime.
4402 2018-03-02 20:56:18 New position (2 Mar 2018): Long $MTCH @ $40.95
Stock reversed on an outside day and after a short consolidation period. Stop loss at $38.47 #stocks #markets
4403 2018-03-02 20:56:14 Should have asked your other girl  your loss
4404 2018-03-02 20:56:02 If bump stocks bans or universal background checks won’t pass what chance do you think a full 2A repeal has? Broaden debate all you like but from a pragmatic POV I’d say you’d be giving right wingers a talking point — like the lies they told about @BarackObama coming for guns
4405 2018-03-02 20:55:41 #Stocks trim losses just before the closing bell #Dow -41, #SP500 +15, #NASDAQ +78 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
4406 2018-03-02 20:54:32 Ban 'em. A bump stock is not a gun. It is an accessory for a gun. Banning bump stocks impinges not a whit on anyone's freedom to posses a gun.
4407 2018-03-02 20:54:25 I was feeling very smug here in beautiful and snow free Inverness, until I went shopping... and realised that fresh food stocks were running pretty low in some shops because delivery lorries can’t get through. Then I thought about the implications of a hard Customs border 
4408 2018-03-02 20:54:24 But I think you never have this stocks..???? Congrt...No opportunities...huhu
4409 2018-03-02 20:53:43 Stock trade violations - insider trading that's why Hatch, Ryan & McConnell are mad because he never warned them so they could sell their stocks
4410 2018-03-02 20:53:12 Dude it's sooo good. Hrmm, I had a good one at Pacific standard in Berkeley. But oceana market in Pacifica also stocks one that is pretty gooooo
4411 2018-03-02 20:53:07 Stocks were recovering. Oil was on the rise. Steel was holding steady. Maybe he talked to Trump & felt the President was about to do something stupid & unloaded. Insider trading? SEC would have to investigate.
4412 2018-03-02 20:53:03 @SenCoryGardner please take action to:
1. Ban bump stocks
2. Allow the CDC to research gun violence
Those are two concrete actions that the vast majority of voters support.  Do your job.
4413 2018-03-02 20:52:44 Or Price buying & selling Health stocks.
4414 2018-03-02 20:52:11 Literally a free for all in stocks right now...
4415 2018-03-02 20:51:37 Ah thank you! Hope you've got enough stocks to see you through this horrid weather!
4416 2018-03-02 20:51:31 You said: "insurance is up, on both dental and medical and we have great insurance.  My stocks are doing ok, for now, that I can ride." We're in the same boat -  Insurance has increased every year but it's the price to pay for great coverage. stocks/401K's looking good, so far.
4417 2018-03-02 20:51:04 Status of his vow to ban bump stocks?
4418 2018-03-02 20:50:51 Strong finish for stocks. The message: Trump is bluffing.
4419 2018-03-02 20:50:30 $BTU with a sort-of volatility contraction pattern -- tightening up recently. Move above 42 would be interesting. Many coal stocks still holding their own, though news-driven this week with the steel stuff going on.
4420 2018-03-02 20:49:36 No big deal.  Stocks usually trade lower on any given Friday.  Folks will go home for the weekend and have a couple beers.  Come Monday, all is forgotten and back to business as usual. #WINNING #MAGA
4421 2018-03-02 20:49:27 The gun lobby obstructionists again! Do-Nothings are complicit in the murders by failure to make reasonable gun legislation, incl universal background checks, ban AR-15 etc, bump stocks. Repubs only want to line their criminal pockets. #NeverAgain #VoteThemOut
4422 2018-03-02 20:48:36 These cookies has sweat since hot stocks .
4423 2018-03-02 20:47:42 well, looks like I won't be selling stocks anytime soon...
4424 2018-03-02 20:47:33 An index fund passively tracks an index, by definition. Most of Vanguard's gun-related holdings (96%, apparently) are in its index funds. There are 'social index' funds that avoid specific sectors/stocks, though, which investors can opt for.
4425 2018-03-02 20:47:26 Hey, at least Carl Icahn got to sell his steel stocks a week prior to Donald blurting out his newest policy prescription. He can be the wealthiest zombie in the aftermath!
4426 2018-03-02 20:47:16 I noticed it long time. Nuff man know which stocks to buy, who going public before stock exchange gives the go ahead. That's why tings always oversubscribed.
4427 2018-03-02 20:46:18 This is so silly
Stocks go up and down
surely you know that the R^2 between news and market is like zero
shame on you for this
4428 2018-03-02 20:46:12 Uninformed persons are a problem repeating the NRA mantra that they "protect our 2A rights, when, in reality, they champion bump-stocks, gun-show loopholes & Cop-killer ammo.
Wait until the day they lock down your neighborhood school because of a possible gun related incident.
4429 2018-03-02 20:46:04 Say no to banning bump stocks.
4430 2018-03-02 20:45:59 $NFLX all time high as stocks bounce
4431 2018-03-02 20:45:05 Nope. Sorry. This was long planned by others & he was ordered to do it. I don’t believe in coincidence & Carl Icahn dumped related stocks.  I would investigate who else did that. Mercers, Kochs & DeVoses maybe?
4432 2018-03-02 20:44:59 Gonna make some serious coin off defense stocks now. Thanks #Putin!
4433 2018-03-02 20:44:51 Do you think Icahn had any input...right ahead of his dumping his steel stocks last week?
4434 2018-03-02 20:44:35 Exactly. I just read how AT LEAST 10 stocks in some of THE LARGEST USA companies are going to plummet if he starts one. Is he off his rocker? Or did Putin instruct him to do this to hurt AMERICA?
4435 2018-03-02 20:44:35 @POTUS Please demand Universal Background Checks. Please support a ban on bump stocks. Please support a ban on AR-15s and similar guns.
4436 2018-03-02 20:44:02 There are lots of stocks out there and all you need is a few of ’em. You have to let the big ones make up for your mistakes - Peter Lynch
4437 2018-03-02 20:43:49 $XOP nice turn today in energy stocks. Supply/Demand favored the bulls all day. Reminds me of the Dec 15/16 action. My only trade was the long loss off the open, should have kept it. Time to move from bearish to neutral. Will definitely have plenty to review this weekend.
4438 2018-03-02 20:43:43 How can you have any confidence in #FoxNews so-called financial news "Journalist" @CGasparino when 2 weeks ago he's BLAMING @POTUS for luring retail investors into buying stocks when the market was so OVERPRICED ... but NOW he's blaming the selloff on @POTUS Steel import #Tariffs
4439 2018-03-02 20:43:27 What are the food stocks like?
4440 2018-03-02 20:42:58 And tip off his billionaire friend of movement in steel stocks in advance
4441 2018-03-02 20:42:56 Hmm... Stocks are dropping, gas, groceries and inflation are on the rise. Did I miss something!?!??
4442 2018-03-02 20:42:53 y. It is only the trade sensitive stocks taking it.
4443 2018-03-02 20:42:46 Then tomorrow he changes his mind and stocks go back up. 

See the pattern?
4444 2018-03-02 20:42:44 $MSPC 0.0009 up 50% massive volume! could close 0.001 methinks!
4445 2018-03-02 20:42:43 How about you do what WE want arrogant, stubborn man
1. Ban automatic rifles
2. Ban bump stocks etc
3. Universal background CKs
4. Min Age restriction 21 
5. Gun license every gun 
6. 30 day wait
7. No sales at gun shows

4450 2018-03-02 20:41:28 #foxbusiness When stocks tumble a little further all the big money smart people will realize that the trade war doom and gloom talk is actually hurting them more than the actual events. At that point they'll talk it back up. Chill, baby, chill.
4451 2018-03-02 20:41:23 Good to see retail stocks come back strong today - my largest industry group position in my portfolio.
4452 2018-03-02 20:41:15 As I mentioned before, I wouldn't put it past Trump to use his office to help his friends make $$$ on the stock exchange fluctuations. Experienced investors buy stocks when they go down and sell when they go up.
4453 2018-03-02 20:41:12 Does anyone else suspect that 45 blurted out his ill-conceived steel & aluminum tariff to force stocks into a tumble for someone like Wilbur Ross to short the market? Call me a cynic but I hope #Mueller is investigating corrupt Ross too.

4461 2018-03-02 20:39:45 Good grief.....don't panic. Trump is trying to stop us from getting raped over trade. The stocks will be FINE! 
4462 2018-03-02 20:39:22 We are in the midst of creating a billion dollar industry as we type this. It's happening already. My Canadian pot stocks confirm that .
4463 2018-03-02 20:39:16 I advocate taking measures that would save  lives, like universal background checks, closing gun show loopholes, banning AR 15 type weapons, raising age for purchase, banning bump stocks, banning mentally ill from buying, and no guns for teachers. How does that harm the 2A?
4464 2018-03-02 20:39:10 NRA won. Semi automatic weapons won. GI Joe wannabes won. Innocent lives LOST. Excuses are old. No one needs bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons.
4465 2018-03-02 20:39:05 I am purchasing $XRP for friends and loved ones that understand the risk/reward and have money to spare. They do not have the technical prowess or time to purchase $XRP on their own so I help them purchase it. 

Tell me, is it illegal to buy stocks for a family member or friend?
4466 2018-03-02 20:39:00 The problem is Trump is in bed with the NRA and it will a diluted form of gun review but the NRA may have a bigger problem a lot of stocks may be pulled as a lot of women have stocks are unhappy with the NRA and Blackstone stocks may pull out
4467 2018-03-02 20:38:44 For the win! We had loads last week courtesy of a lovely colleague who seemed to have bought the entire city’s stocks! Can I recommend putting them in your boots too for toasty toes! Solidarity

4475 2018-03-02 20:35:42 Corey, You always seem to bring the nutbags out!They don't even realize that nothing will happen on guns other than bump stocks. Just like DACA,Oblundercare! Trump always says things that will bring dems to the table, then they drop the ball. #KeepFighting #MVGA2018 #DropKaine
4476 2018-03-02 20:35:38 I wouldn't be surprised but two reasons i'd bet against it: 1) the stocks are so small not sure how it fill itself out and 2) too dark a theme, even for the wild and crazy issuers..
4477 2018-03-02 20:35:31 @realDonaldTrump Just say NO to being manipulated by the Left & Ivanka & Jared to raise the age for buying guns or banning bump stocks. It WOULDNT STOP THE FL KILLING or ANY KILLING. What happens the NEXT time? Oh that wld be TODAY in MI! Now what? You r PUNISHING THE WRONG PPL!

4480 2018-03-02 20:34:04 I don't disagree with that. But there's been violence at many  schools. This situation is only highlighted due to current political battle raging on. We can all argue over gun rights, limiting types, bump stocks...but things can be done NOW, that both sides can't argue.
4481 2018-03-02 20:34:01 On my own? Little bit weird. I'm a 40 year old man. Even the cat refused to go in the garden today.
4482 2018-03-02 20:33:53 Maybe all of his other friends shorted the stocks also.
4483 2018-03-02 20:33:21 Will Trump issue an executive order banning bump stocks?
4484 2018-03-02 20:33:00 Semi-automatic rifles, generally modeled cosmetically and functionally off the AR-15 platform, typically modular, allowing for the easy swapping of parts (grips, stocks, sights and scopes, etc.)
4485 2018-03-02 20:32:57 #ItsTime #NeverAgain #SDPD #SchoolShooting #ItsTime Too many mass shootings, now is the time for action. Call your MOC's at 202-224-3121. Tell them its time to talk about gun control laws. No bump stocks, raise the age to buy to 21, no weapons of war for civillans
4486 2018-03-02 20:32:41 1 of 2
Reasonable gun reform:
 Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, large clips, large ammo buys
 Background checks
 No one with history of violence, especially domestic violence, can buy/own
 One week or more waiting period
 Create national gun registry
4487 2018-03-02 20:32:27 @NPR   please explain why you keep reporting that Trump "appears" to have supported gun control?  He SAID it.
1) ignores due process by “Take the guns first, “go through due process second.”
2) advocates for raising the purchase age to 21.
3) bans bump-stocks.

4489 2018-03-02 20:31:14 That’s a good start, but why not add raising age to 21 for all firearms and banning bump stocks?
4490 2018-03-02 20:30:54 Thankyou president Trump. The only people knocking you for this is people that care more about their stocks going down. America is obviously second to them. Or their just America hating democrats.

4492 2018-03-02 20:30:04 Think you are right, but that will never happen in this country imho.  I think we should be able to agree on increasing the wait period for buying a gun, have all purchasers get a psych exam, outlaw bump stocks, intensify the backgrd check,etc

4495 2018-03-02 20:29:26 the gun stocks make up like .01% of IWM or something so it would almost literally be same thing. Q is what would it cost given it is same thing and doesn't havce the liquidity ?

Trump's steel tax makes a lot of $sense if you're Carl Icohn. Wonder how he knew to buy millions of steel stocks a few weeeks before the announcement yesterday. Another investigation is needed.

He sold before 6% value was gone.

4540 2018-03-02 20:15:54 Maybe they should look into Carl Ichan’s recent sale of steel stocks...
4541 2018-03-02 20:15:48 Here’s a better plan:
1) Make background checks universal.
2) Ban assault weapons.
3) Ban bump stocks.
4) Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles.
5) Refuse to accept #NRABloodMoney.

4543 2018-03-02 20:14:55 Seems to me they should do the gun legislation piece by piece.  Bump stocks then background checks  then assault weapons.  If you put them all together some contingent in the House won't like some aspect of it and there will never be a majority of the majority to vote for it. 1/

4546 2018-03-02 20:12:43 It's about time someone @FoxNews talked sensible. Why does the right say the left wants to take away guns. Not true. Ban bump stocks & assault weapons nobody sb using inless it's to kill multiple ppl at a time. Right to bear arms w/b a handgun The right want to control ppls lives

4549 2018-03-02 20:11:52 lol. One of Trump's friends sold a whole lot of steel related stocks just last week (hello SEC). Kushner got loans from at least two companies that he had WH meetings with. Mueller is asking lots of questions about what Trump knew when.

4552 2018-03-02 20:10:50 Relax, it's just a bit of market manipulation. As soon as Carl Icahn buys back his and Don's steel related stocks, Trumpie will call off the tariffs.
4553 2018-03-02 20:10:44 Wondering if this last hour will be a verkackte close or just some more meh sideways for stocks.
4554 2018-03-02 20:09:48 A few Trump “friends” dumped their steel stocks before his announcement of tariffs.

CARL ICAHN being one, plus a Russian businessman.

MarthaStewart went to prison for that, it’s called INSIDER TRADING.

#GaryCohn would be looking after number one if he bails right now...

There are plenty of 5.56/.224 weapons with wood stocks that are not assault labeled so I guess they are saying blueing is the assault part? Lol

7. Enhance flagging system
8. Ban bump stocks

4597 2018-03-02 19:55:20 It's wonderful that you support healing.  Please use your powerful position and voice to protect our children and schools by calling for a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines and universal background checks. Please help save the kids!
4598 2018-03-02 19:55:12 Im with you
4599 2018-03-02 19:55:04 Considering I saw a story earlier today saying that a friend of his invested in a bunch of Steel Stocks last week, I have a feeling it was pre-planned.
4600 2018-03-02 19:54:54 @FoxBusiness Tariffs on steel and aluminum will have no impact on tech stocks, not even Tesla! Trump is exerting USA strength to get fair deals replacing global agreements which have drained the red blood out of the USA red white and blue killing US.
4601 2018-03-02 19:54:34 #Stocks,#Indexes Rally is now sufficiently strong to generate a top signal (not today).
4602 2018-03-02 19:54:16 A little research shows that most of his buddies and friends have been dumping their stocks when it comes to metals this is got to be illegal dick did it two weeks before he announced it he's making money with this
4603 2018-03-02 19:54:07 looks like Trump starts trade war to manipulate stocks ... benefit for his buddies or russian investors?
4604 2018-03-02 19:53:48 So uh stadium apartments just lost power
4605 2018-03-02 19:53:41 $MSPC 001's coming soon!  Stay tuned!
4606 2018-03-02 19:53:39 I dont think as many people know what it means as you think. Another guy on this same thread is arguing that the AR-15 shoots more than one bullet at a time. Im not against certain laws. I believe bump stocks should be banned, no more than a 10 round mag and be 21. For all guns.
4607 2018-03-02 19:53:37 I'm just afraid that politicians will regulate off of misinformation, and limit guns based on what looks scary or what heresay they've run into, rather than limit based on effectiveness. For example, all this concern about "assault rifle", nothing about bump stocks.
4608 2018-03-02 19:52:38 If tariffs are no biggie why did Ross sell off a huge portfolio of steel related stocks VERY RECENTLY???
4609 2018-03-02 19:51:44 A few actually haha my friend making money got me to start my best advice is to get a fake stock app. It gives you fake money to invest in real stocks.
4610 2018-03-02 19:51:13 Guess you are the one afraid of the NRA @realDonaldTrump sure changed your tune after you met with them at the Whitehouse with no cameras present, in 2days you went from supporting universal background checks, raising age to 21 & banning bump stocks #NRABloodMoney #UnfitForOffice
4611 2018-03-02 19:51:08 Take EXTENDED CLIPS OFF the Market. Restrict the SALE of ASSAULT WEAPONS . Take BUMP stocks OFF THE Market. Raise the AGE to 21 To BUY such weapons after EXTENDED Background Checks. DO a TRUE BILL , Not the Usual BS ...
4612 2018-03-02 19:50:59 And yet tRump was able to pay back some favors by leaking the news to some other crooks who immediately dumped their stocks. What do you know?  He certainly has his own agenda of priorities. Most all illegal. Hope the insider trading scam hits him where it hurts.
4613 2018-03-02 19:50:58 As FLOTUS please use your voice to call out for a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines  to protect our children and schools.  You are in this position and it would be wonderful to use it for good in this world and that would be good.  Please help!
4614 2018-03-02 19:50:33 Does Trump start this trade war just to manipulate stocks on a daily basis in order tosupport end benefit stock holding buddies? Looks pretty much like that.
4615 2018-03-02 19:50:29 Carl Icahn, DT pal, just dumped $31MILLION in STEEL STOCKS day before DT announcement ant Steel Tariffs! They're ALL GET FILTHY RICH OFF us
4616 2018-03-02 19:50:11 #WATCH: Senior Research Analyst Mig Dobre on @BloombergTV discussing his downgrade on machinery stocks 3:00 PM ET #BairdOnTV
4617 2018-03-02 19:49:38 #CarlIcahn also bought many #stocks of #BEA only hours before #Oracle announced the desire to #takeover more than a decade ago. #Icahn #InsiderTrading. #Trump #epicfail
4618 2018-03-02 19:49:14 Volatility is fantastic. A lot of traders depend on volatility to purchase quality stocks with low PE ratios.
4619 2018-03-02 19:48:54 The only people who Tump told were his friend's who owned steel stocks. They sold. White House staff, Commerce and State Departments didn't know and weren't prepared. Trump is completely clueless.

4623 2018-03-02 19:48:12 I think Jesus Christ might consider protecting our children with solid gun control which includes a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines and universal background checks worthy of a "well done" and sign of faithfulness.  Don't you think?  Please act now!
4624 2018-03-02 19:48:10 #ABCNewsSociopaths (a "top story" on website), proving they are #SociopathicLiars: "#Stocks keep plunging, as #Trump talks #TradeWar." False. Lie. Stocks stabilized after early drop, & both S & P 500 & #Nasdaq actually turned positive.
4625 2018-03-02 19:47:53 I thought I heard Tiny Hands Trump say he'd get rid of bump stocks himself. I took that to mean he'd use an executive order to do that. Was I wrong?  I haven't heard another word about it.
4626 2018-03-02 19:47:34 @MartinSLewis any thoughts on a cash vs stocks and shares Lifetime ISA, if we want to buy a house in 5 years? I can't work out the risk...
4627 2018-03-02 19:47:33 Also, your Finance Applets (formerly known as Stocks) are back up and running after a recent fix. Make that money y'all!   
4628 2018-03-02 19:47:13 Thanks for sinking stocks and making us all pay more for beer, etc.

4630 2018-03-02 19:46:31 Trump confidant dumped Millions in steel-related stocks last week . Days before tariff announcement!! 
4631 2018-03-02 19:46:30 He’s temperamentally unfit; a spur of the moment decision made in anger, no thought of consequences. One of his pals & former advisors made out pretty good; he dumped $31.3M worth of stocks 2 weeks before the announcement yesterday — I think they call that insider trading.
4632 2018-03-02 19:46:11 Trump’s friends sold steel stocks days before tariff announced. Hmmmm.
4633 2018-03-02 19:45:46 I presume,  but do not know, that he then purchased other stocks that would go up, likewise.
Shrug
4634 2018-03-02 19:45:27 I can't get over how many people are still hell-bent on trading stocks.   What an ancient realm.  Dinosaurs like being old, I think
4635 2018-03-02 19:45:12 We look at all the usual valuation screens to identify stocks that are cheap relative to book value, earnings and cash flow. -- Jon Jacobson
4636 2018-03-02 19:45:08 I think bump stocks should never have been made available to the public. They should have halted production completely and banned them a long time ago imo!
4637 2018-03-02 19:44:39 agree, so how did obama pass bump stocks and why did you agree?
4638 2018-03-02 19:44:32 Hmmm...would that be the same as all of Nancy Pelosi’s friends, family & cronies that have possibly benefitted hundreds of millions of dollars in land, stocks & information from her being in congress for the past 30years?
4639 2018-03-02 19:44:24 Pump & Dump - It is an operation carried by operators - can be done on both quality & non quality stocks

It's like giving steroids to underaged to become mature early !!

Most likely candidate for this operation r stocks with
1. Bad fundamentals/Debt
2. Illiquid equity
3. Story
4640 2018-03-02 19:43:49 Actually companies are buying back their own stocks. You’ve been conned yet again
4641 2018-03-02 19:43:22 What about Icahn dumping stocks days before tariff announcement?
4642 2018-03-02 19:43:12 Signs of volatility in these stocks. — Not good!
4643 2018-03-02 19:43:03 My stocks are either addressed as "Do something you fucking turd" or "Yes, goooo MOOOON".
4644 2018-03-02 19:42:29 He is the most corrupt person to ever hold the office. He dumped his steel stocks before announcing the tariffs. That's illegal.
4645 2018-03-02 19:42:28 Is that's what's happening? It looks more like Trump is imposing a tariff that consumers have to pay for via decreased purchasing power, which will prop up steel mill CEOs who weren't even in trouble in the first place.

Hence why steel-related stocks went up initially.

4647 2018-03-02 19:41:38 Maybe bump stocks, and red flag, but you can stuff the rest.
4648 2018-03-02 19:41:37 Why did you and Carl Icahn dump millions in steel stocks just before you announced this?
4649 2018-03-02 19:41:15 First- nice language.  Second, what did prior administrations do to prevent shootings.  I'll wait.  OH I know!!! Obama legalized bump stocks...Now I'll wait.
4650 2018-03-02 19:41:11 The robo only invests in individual stocks? Doesn’t sound very efficient.
4651 2018-03-02 19:41:08 You know what else would really help?  Reasonable gun regulations i. e. No fly list, domestic violence, violent offenders, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, private sales, gun show loophole and universal background checks for starters.
4652 2018-03-02 19:40:54 Exactly!

But "muh feelings" so I'll panic and sell all my stocks! Cause I'm a 6 year old child....
4653 2018-03-02 19:40:42 I'm sure it's just a coincidence Trump's buddy Icahn dumped steel-related stocks just before Trump announced tariffs.
4654 2018-03-02 19:40:34 Are you kidding...just sold all my gassy stocks BXE, BTE and BNP because of disastrous results... DON'T BUY CANADIAN ENERGY STOCKS

4658 2018-03-02 19:40:03 Dear O'Rourke, name one reason why a citizen needs an AR-15? We don't need a conversation we need to ban that together with bump stocks and high capacity magazines, since no one, the military and some law enforcement needs those.
4659 2018-03-02 19:39:48 In my college lecture this afternoon drinking my coffee and checking the stocks. I hear kids talking about they moms catching them smoking weed lass night and took their beano and grinder ... i thought i left highschool in 2015.
4660 2018-03-02 19:39:32 Their stocks went up, just like DICK'S Sporting Goods did. The vast majority of Americans aren't Ammosexuals, but reasonable people wanting a "WELL-REGULATED" gun policy. And I'm a gun owner.
4661 2018-03-02 19:39:17 so maybe he is top 5 but the 5th for me. analyst like mayock says what they say everyone has an opinion &  its just an opinion until facts next year back it up ppl do hella mock drafts & theyre all different stocks they all rate people differently.

4663 2018-03-02 19:38:54 It is true that wall street investors make more money faster by shorting the stocks than buying and waiting for the values to increase 'in the long term'
4664 2018-03-02 19:38:42 Carl Icahn, Trump’s buddy, dumps $31,000,000 in steel related stocks a couple days before Trump’s announced tariffs.

4674 2018-03-02 19:35:38 is this a principle based argument? or because you're long gun stocks? or because you don't think we have a gun problem?

4682 2018-03-02 19:33:50 We have to start somewhere, Jen. @marcorubio can only present this and promote it. Ultimately, he will not be the one to enact it. I personally believe a ban on bump stocks is in order as well.
4683 2018-03-02 19:33:42 Las Vegas is forced down the memory hole? Bump stocks & any number of common use gun parts are about to be banned.
4684 2018-03-02 19:33:17 Ban the AR 15 and all similar weapons, ban bump stocks, raise the age limit and mandate a wait period. How about adding that? #NeverAgainMSD
4685 2018-03-02 19:32:49 Stocks are owned by Union Pension funds.
4686 2018-03-02 19:32:43 That would be a game changer. Perhaps if we can get an accredited decentralized exchange they could trade stocks on the blockchain. Looking at you @airswap

4697 2018-03-02 19:29:57 Note that healthcare stocks are soaring today. Why? Perhaps because after the sly insertions in the tax Bill, healthcare costs will soar, preexisting problems will not be covered, profits unlimited, and Americans will needlessly die impoverished.
4698 2018-03-02 19:29:56 I think it's funny that people want to "buy low and sell high" in crypto, like they're playing stocks.   How about "buy everywhere and don't sell at all"?
4699 2018-03-02 19:29:52 Then this jackass of a @POTUS should be brought up on charges of manipulating the stock market.  How do we know he didn't tell his friends to short steel and aluminum stocks because he was going to announce tariffs?

"Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media
pundits"
4704 2018-03-02 19:28:35 It is hardly rampant.  Still below 3% in 10y with the curve getting flatter as the fed hikes.  If inflation comes then perhaps there may be a reassessment of long term deflationary forces but I doubt it.  If stocks tank, bonds will likely rally

4706 2018-03-02 19:28:26 I would like to see an end of Spanish and French trawlers plundering British waters and decimating fish stocks with their undersized mesh nets. British waters were once the nursery of all north European fish stock. I know it angers Cornishman.
4707 2018-03-02 19:27:42 After the stocks crash and Trump changes his mind, I would be curious who or if someone bought them back prior to him changing his mind?
4708 2018-03-02 19:27:37 @stephenfhayes Do you have a problem understanding that POTUS 45 is not a professional politician? He is a businessman who is getting things done in government!

4724 2018-03-02 19:20:51 I appreciate your comment but, from what I see, no one is asking for removal of the 2nd Amendment. The ask is to outlaw bump stocks, weapons such as the AR-15 and high capacity cartridges.

4726 2018-03-02 19:20:33 Selling off tens of millions of Steel stocks right before Trumps tariffs gaffe.
4727 2018-03-02 19:20:30 Carl Icahn dumped over 32m in steel stocks a week prior to the steel tariffs.

Martha Stewart went to prison for dumping 230k after her financial advisor told her bad news was coming.

There's no coincidence. He should be held accountable just like Martha was.
#SteelTariffs
4728 2018-03-02 19:19:45 Sure do those things, but the weapons used in all recent mass shootings were purchased legally. Nearly all involved the same weapon, the AR and/or bump stocks. Where is any of this addressed in your plan?
4729 2018-03-02 19:19:26 Trump and Co dumped a bunch of stocks on Monday. Wednesday Trump announced the tariffs out of the blue. Looks and sounds like insider trading.
Check with @tedlieu , has a VERY interesting post on it!
4730 2018-03-02 19:18:58 I definitely want to be a millionaire .. shit a billionaire... but realistically 1M ain’t just gonna poof into my hands , so imma start w this lil goal & just flip that numerous times with investments , property and stocks till it turns to a M, then u know... rinse, wash, repeat
4731 2018-03-02 19:18:41 And cheap products fm #China combined w/ #QE from @federalreserve kept #inflation & #wages low.This served only one asset class: #stocks!
4732 2018-03-02 19:17:59 #smart so now don’t invest in anything  because once you tax gas everything is going to skyrocket in price sooo stocks will most likely go down anyways! War will do that too! Plans for that? whoops  #nationalsecurity
4733 2018-03-02 19:17:50 Thoughts/opinions on bump stocks
4734 2018-03-02 19:16:40 London stocks finished the week at their session lows as the White House's pledge to slap tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium reverberated around the world.
4735 2018-03-02 19:16:33 Carl Icahn is supposed to have sold off a large amount of steel stocks, etc. just a short time ago.
4736 2018-03-02 19:16:16 In fact, the bump stocks turned what are regular semi-automatics into fully autos which are banned.
4737 2018-03-02 19:15:54 Do people not know that stocks go up and down all the time..? We saw that with Obama when he was making awful trades and putting the USA in tremendous debt.
4738 2018-03-02 19:15:49 Pretty. I love wood stocks. Gived a gun that certain "home owned" look. Black, synthetics seem less personal, more mass produced in comparrison to me.
4739 2018-03-02 19:15:48 This may be news to you, but if someone wants to create a modified weapon (which is what he used), for a mass killing, then a ban is not going to be much use is it?   Fully automatic weapons are banned and bump stocks which make them automatic should be too.
4740 2018-03-02 19:15:36 Right on. I’ve been hodling 420 stocks for a few years. Just waiting for it to be federally legalized 
4741 2018-03-02 19:14:50 $uav
4742 2018-03-02 19:14:35 Second thought, keep panicing! As you panic and sell, you lower the value of stocks allowing  me to buy more and increase my portfolio's value! Keep on being worry warts, sell sell sell, your helping me make more money in my future! @NYSE_WallStreet
4743 2018-03-02 19:14:21 OK... So gossip right now. News not confirmed by Stephanie Ruhle, foremore Goldman Sachs... Carl Icon dumped his steel stocks last week. Lol!

Stocks dump as I tweet due to trump imposing tariffs on steel.

I can't even get back to a good book to read right now!
4744 2018-03-02 19:14:21 $NFLX even crazier than $AMZN ... and most hated FANG stock among those who love FANG stocks.  $QQQ
4745 2018-03-02 19:14:16 certainly none of them are pumping GALT aka the greatest of all biotech stocks ever
4746 2018-03-02 19:14:01 $ESV too much negativity here... my saying of the week on other stocks that bounced. $LC $SGYP
4747 2018-03-02 19:13:59 45 held a talking session about DACA said he would sign whatever congress came up with, "just do it, I will take the heat" than rejects bill, than holds meeting about gun control commits to age limits, banning bumb stocks & universal background checks, nothing done! #TrumpIsALiar
4748 2018-03-02 19:13:54 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
4749 2018-03-02 19:13:36 however, tariffs would likely be bullish for domestic steel stocks...
4750 2018-03-02 19:13:29 Not breaking.... USA has gone so downhill. That's what happens... the stocks go up and down. Funny how you wouldn't make a big thing or headline when Obama was in office...
4751 2018-03-02 19:13:13 He also said Mexico would pay for a wall.  LOL  Whether he said it or not, doesn't mean he hasn't profited from it.  You think it was coincidence that Icahn dumped his stocks?
4752 2018-03-02 19:12:54 Weird day on Twitter. My notifications column has been flooded with Russian Trump bots touting crappy biotech stocks.
4753 2018-03-02 19:12:32 Terex (NYSE:TEX) is now covered by analysts at Morgan Stanley. They set an "equal weight" rating and a $45.00 price target on the stock. 18.3% upside from the current price of $38.04.  Good long term buy . #investing #investment #stocks
4754 2018-03-02 19:12:26 I feel like I have no idea who is actually running our country. Is it Jared, Ivanka, Kelly, Russia, Saudi Arabia, a person with stocks in steel? I mean it can’t be @realDonaldTrump could it - cuz it doesn’t feel like it.
4755 2018-03-02 19:12:11 Cormorants in inland waterways is a recent phenomenon I believe caused by diminishing coastal fish-stocks....?
4756 2018-03-02 19:11:46 bet djt is shorting stocks.
4757 2018-03-02 19:11:36 2020 is my estimate based on all the info I have, keep making fun of it. But remember: It‘s stairs up, elevator down in the stock market. $TSLA and all other story / momo stocks will crash HARD when the tide turns.
4758 2018-03-02 19:11:36 I would call that insider trading. Makes me wonder if Trump did the same with his stocks in steel. Time for a SEC investigation.
4759 2018-03-02 19:11:15 They better do a hell of a lot more than raise the age to buy guns. Ban bump stocks, 14 day waiting period, full & complete background can and #BanAssaultWeaponsNow.               #Never Again
4760 2018-03-02 19:11:09 85% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of wealthy Americans
4761 2018-03-02 19:11:04 Russia, Now threatening the West with stealth Nukes! Trump doesn't even respond or mention, but still refuses sanctions. In the event Russia or North Korea should Attack were all screwed. Stocks ( our pensions and 401k's) are tanking, as the rich get all the tax breaks. Trump
4762 2018-03-02 19:11:04 Well Mr. Base-everything-off-the-stock-market, my stocks are down bigly!
4763 2018-03-02 19:11:03 Haha!  Your man Trump was just helping a friend who needed to dump some steel stocks. He will back away from the tariffs now. So...  about Russia nuclear threat to Florida & our elections being hacked, what ya doin there?
4764 2018-03-02 19:10:52 Stocks struggling to go green for the day I believe in part on hope that tariffs will be targeted by the time they are actual policy. They may or may not be.
4765 2018-03-02 19:09:15 This Christmas I want to just receive gifted stocks going forward.... lol 
4766 2018-03-02 19:08:23 As soon as his friends give the signal that they have repurchased the stocks they sold at a high after they went down ( sell high buy low) then he'll reverses his  tune
4767 2018-03-02 19:07:58 The best way to get back at youtube and twitter is to sell all their stocks if you have em! Hit them in the pocket!

4769 2018-03-02 19:07:22 leading stocks fared much better than the averages did this week.  Many stocks which I have highlighted with charts are holding on just fine
$SQ $OLI $SINA $MZOR $TEAM $JD broke below 50 day on earnings but so far still holding its 200 day SMA
4770 2018-03-02 19:06:42 Also to divert attention from the gun control issue. Trump has, and never had, any intention of doing any gun control reform.He just helped the gun manufacturers as people just ran out and bought more guns when he made this fake proclamation. Gun stocks went up.
The NRA loves it.
4771 2018-03-02 19:06:40 $NVDA $NFLX still my favorite stocks out there
4772 2018-03-02 19:06:24 But now that Trump has actually done a few things to steer the stocks away from the 2016 trends, guess which direction he's steering them!
4773 2018-03-02 19:06:04 He must have because it's missing a ban on bump stocks, a ban on military-style weapons and a ban on high-capacity magazines.  Pretty much everything the Parkland kids want. #VoteThemOut2018
4774 2018-03-02 19:05:49 My stocks aren't winning
4775 2018-03-02 19:05:10 Yes? Well if you not old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes, you shouldn't be old enough to legaly buy a gun, let alone a semi automatic riffle nor bump stocks. Tho you, in the actual state of things can in US...you see why they have all the right to speak out?
4776 2018-03-02 19:05:03 But if Trump is serious and can overcome opposition, cost of buying the dip could be too terrible, especially for tech stocks
4777 2018-03-02 19:04:56 A majority of American citizens want the removal of AR 15 assault rifles, Bump stocks and armor piercing bullets. #neveragain

4781 2018-03-02 19:03:25 All of the OEMs use imported steel, which is why the Big 3’s stocks are taking a hit.  You are cheering on a rise in the price of the products your husband sells, which will mean fewer buyers.  Again, look at the automaker’s stocks.

4783 2018-03-02 19:02:12 I think so too, bull market on its last legs, we had an incredible rally since early 2009 (from an admittedly very low start). Cycles don‘t last forever. Cash-hungry story stocks like $TSLA will suffer hard: Credit/dilution options cut off AND demand for high-end cars freezing.
4784 2018-03-02 19:02:06 mdrrr alors là pas du tout j'ai vla les arguments en stocks, j'ai juste la flemme de faire 40 tweet, on poursuivra ce débat tranquillement sur discord
4785 2018-03-02 19:01:43 I just found out there is an avocado restaurant in NY called @avocaderia and honestly that’s all I’m tryna find next week while I’m there
4786 2018-03-02 19:01:25 How about the sale of steel stocks by Ichan a week before the announcement?
4787 2018-03-02 19:01:09 I actively trade stocks. You are the only bank that routinely goes offline during market hours.
4788 2018-03-02 19:00:28 @JeffMacke Do you follow stocks like $VMW?
4789 2018-03-02 19:00:15 Maybe bump stocks were used thank obama!
4790 2018-03-02 19:00:04 The market must be heavy in China stocks. The "trade equalization" is a great positive for US companies. The math and supercomputer games of Wall Street. Who knows, they may be the object of foreign intervention or globalist market manipulators. Not the first time.
4791 2018-03-02 18:59:49 You really are a shithead, stocks are still up 25% since President Trump was Elected, only down 7% from their all time high in January. I’m sure you don’t have any $, so you wouldn’t know that.
4792 2018-03-02 18:59:34 And now we find that Carl Ichan is selling off stocks days before his buddy announces new ridiculous tariffs.  This is filling the swamp with new, nightmarish, creatures.
4793 2018-03-02 18:59:21 No they shouldn’t be and that’s why full auto was banned from private civilians many years ago. 
POTUS is behind banning bump stocks which is a conversion kit for semi auto. I can get behind that ban easily
4794 2018-03-02 18:59:12 and apparently telling everyone around him beforehand so they could all sell their steel stocks pronto and make a killing
4795 2018-03-02 18:59:08 I'm not entirely buying this? How then, did Icahn know to dump his stocks a few days prior? Something smells like a coverup!
4796 2018-03-02 18:58:29 Well, apparently Carl Icahn was told because he dumped 31 million in steel dependent stocks a few days ago.
4797 2018-03-02 18:58:26 Ban bump stocks ... raise the age to obtain a gun to 21... 7 day waiting period.....ban the sale of assault weapons ... background checks mandatory and entered into national database...mandatory mental health programs... anyone with prior arrests should never be able to own one
4798 2018-03-02 18:58:17 In the case of money & stocks there are no coincidences, sorry buddy you screwed the pooch once again.
  @realDonaldTrump
4799 2018-03-02 18:58:08 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
4800 2018-03-02 18:57:56 "Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management ".

Fairer for who? The Danish and Spanish fleets, from the sound of it- reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management.
4801 2018-03-02 18:57:31 Due to the weather conditions we're sorry to say we won't be making it to Todmorden Market on Saturday 3rd March. 

Many apologies - the cold has finally caught up with us!

Our bread is available tomorrow at @ValOrgcoop  in Hebden Bridge (while stocks last)
4802 2018-03-02 18:57:20 Gonna be buying all these stocks when I’m 21 gotta save now tho
4803 2018-03-02 18:57:19 And when Icahn and @realDonaldTrump are asked about dumping stocks, will they tell the truth?...sorry rhetorical question.
4804 2018-03-02 18:57:15 I'm not so sure of that.  Did you see that Icahn sold off his steel stocks?
4805 2018-03-02 18:57:14 Ok. An AR-15 is not an assault rifle. That is a term specifically for select fire and full auto rifles. M16 and M4 are assault rifles.

Bump firing is a technique, bump stocks make it easier is all. They don't alter the function of the weapon.
4806 2018-03-02 18:56:03 Investigate #Icahn for dumping $31M #Steel stocks ahead of #steeltariff announcement. #insidertrading NO INDIVIDUAL IS BEYOND REPROACH

4810 2018-03-02 18:54:56 What about Icahn selling all his steel stocks last week?
4811 2018-03-02 18:54:55 Hope Our gains in weed stocks cover the loss in my business.
4812 2018-03-02 18:54:50 "Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management ".

Fairer for who? The Danish and Spanish fleets, from the sound of it. So Scottish fishermen are being left behind.
4813 2018-03-02 18:54:40 HEARD ABOUT BUMP STOCKS
4814 2018-03-02 18:54:38 @DeanHeller
It is Friday where is your statement about last week's Congressional review on gun control
Did you make any statements
Come on Dean do a blanket support for assault rifles
You know twirling bullet ARs
What about 10 shot magizines
Bump Stocks
Las V has opinions

4815 2018-03-02 18:54:38 Noy buying it. How did Icahn know to drop his stocks just a few days prior. Someone is trying to change the narrative
4816 2018-03-02 18:54:35 And the Hope Hicks sudden resignation to be followed by tell all book, and Carl Icahn insider trading on steel stocks, and ivanka money laundering with diamonds, and the weeks not over
4817 2018-03-02 18:54:25 I'm beginning to think trump says these things to affect the markets. He and his friends could make a lot of  money by shorting stocks in whatever industry he scares. I hope Mueller looks at his financial closely
4818 2018-03-02 18:54:11 #Uranium stocks are ready for the next leg up.  Credit Suisse buying across the board.
4819 2018-03-02 18:54:02 I don’t believe Icahn is stupid enough to trade stocks on inside tariff information. I do believe, however, that Jared Kushner is more than stupid enough to try and punish Qatar. Fits the Kushner Crime Family M.O. to a ‘T’.

4824 2018-03-02 18:52:47 I appreciate all the concern over possible insider trading with Carl Ichan dumping his steel stocks last week (and it should be investigated), but Jesus people, the president had been telegraphing that move for a while now.
4825 2018-03-02 18:52:47 @realDonaldTrump Dems shouldn't get carte blanche, if they want bump stocks and age 21, WE NEED RECIPROCITY 1ST! #2ndAmendment #2a

4829 2018-03-02 18:51:30 Here's a warped LENS: 

Smart people: Stocks are in the toilet, dollar is devaluing, interest rates rising, Trump is adding trillions in deficit, and now he want tariffs which NEVER historically work and only harm our economy.

Trumpanzees: W-w-w-well he's playing 4D Chess...!
4830 2018-03-02 18:51:14 brushes? its not hard to do that i never use cloud stocks I use brushes always
4831 2018-03-02 18:51:02 we have been putting out arguments. all of them. stricter regulations, getting rid of bump stocks, getting rid of outright assault rifles, raising the min age to buying a weapon, etc. but republicans don’t want to hear any of it because “muh guns!!!!!” over lives.
4832 2018-03-02 18:50:15 What’s making it harder? No one is asking for a ban on all guns. Just more regulation to make it harder to get one, more accountability regarding ownership (the person purchasing it is responsible), and making unnecessary items (bump stocks, extended mags, etc.) unavailable.
4833 2018-03-02 18:50:07 So which is it? Backgrounds, bump stocks, high capacity, “assault weapons”, ARs, semi-automatics, shotguns...or ban and restrict EVERYTHING? Just say what you really want! #NeverAgain
4834 2018-03-02 18:50:06 Let's hope they catch something in their bump stocks - oh wait - it's micro so no chance.

4838 2018-03-02 18:49:08 At stock exchange people are constantly yelling “sell gun stocks!” What an odd place to try to buy a gun...
4839 2018-03-02 18:49:06 Why dont u talk about this from the white house podium so all americans know your plan instead of tweeting. So unpresidential. You need to go to president school and learn a few things IDIOT!! Your off the cuff oral diarrhea is ruining our stocks
4840 2018-03-02 18:48:16 Amen. You can go through a 30 round magazine in seconds. Bump stocks are fun as hell, and only used once in a mass shooting. Does anyone know how many are in circulation? 1 bad guy ruined it for everybody
4841 2018-03-02 18:47:33 Hey @realDonaldTrump, Carl Icahn said thanks for the steel announcement heads up! He dumped $31.3 MILLION of his stocks just in time!!
4842 2018-03-02 18:46:52 I see you're unwilling to learn about what tariffs have done historically, and are now desperately changing the subject. The weakness of the US dollar, the damage tariffs do to our economy, the damage he's doing to the stocks.... is this how Trump is "defeating" the Kochs?
4843 2018-03-02 18:46:39 But you would have it so some guy in a suit sitting behind a desk trading stocks keeps getting richer while people actually have to get their hands dirty just to survive. Why not keep those jobs here and make it harder to import back?
4844 2018-03-02 18:46:34 My stocks are crap! Most comes from South Korea in trade. I’m not president and know this! GOP leaders are furious at you.

4850 2018-03-02 18:45:01 The only people who seemed to know were Trump's confidants who sold off steel stocks last week for millions in profits.

4852 2018-03-02 18:44:49 Am I missing something? Steel stocks have gone up since the announcement. Only an idiot would dump domestic steel stocks knowing that Trump was going to impose tariffs on imports.
4853 2018-03-02 18:44:39 I'm selling my stocks...he is going to crash the economy...what a dotard
4854 2018-03-02 18:44:19 @SullyCNBC You know coal stocks also benefit from this because you need Met coal to melt the commodity.  $CLD $ARCH $CNX $ARCH all green in a bad tape.  DT needs voters in The Rust belt for 2020.
4855 2018-03-02 18:44:18 So... Buy stocks in X?
4856 2018-03-02 18:44:15 #CarlIcahn sure knew there was going to be a #tradewar or #stocks were going to tumble. Good time to #short the #StockMarket. Nothing fishy going on here.
4857 2018-03-02 18:44:09 Speaking of relative strength, look at Antero! $AR #stocks #relativestrength
4858 2018-03-02 18:43:57 Free TRADE'S a lie, please address this!!  TARIFFS keep jobs here, TARIFFS could require the other countries selling here to PAY FARE WAGES& WORKING CONDITIONS!!  FREE trade is not FREE..Outsourcing Is Killing the Middle Class, all for PROFIT, MONEY, GREED & Ofcorse Corp. STOCKS
4859 2018-03-02 18:43:55 Black market guns are expensive, and rn there’s little reason to go on the black market, what with bump stocks and semi-auto weapons.
4860 2018-03-02 18:43:22 Well they can count me in thanks to their tax break I can buy alot of stocks with the extra $0.17 cents I get a week!!
4861 2018-03-02 18:43:20 No. Tax return dropped by $800.00. People at my current job and jobs across the country  are laid off. Businesses are buying back stocks with their refunds. Things really suck. Leave Cult45.
4862 2018-03-02 18:43:02 Let me tell you about the individuals who will be the first to speak out against the tariffs are our so-called leaders Schumer and Pelosi all the while they get paid in stocks investments in real estate, all the while this economy suffers the blows.
4863 2018-03-02 18:42:56 Stocks
4864 2018-03-02 18:42:56 45 & the GOP r trying to put Americans middle/poor ppl into financial ruins by destroying retirement funds & other investments stocks & bonds. 45/GOP remember this What goes around comes around NO weapons formed against us Shall Not Prosper or b successful in Peace! (Prov.11:28)
4865 2018-03-02 18:42:56 Completely agree. It's almost comparable to stocks on the town square.
4866 2018-03-02 18:42:40 Bought start positions in GOOGL, DIA, XLK, QQQ #stocks #markets
4867 2018-03-02 18:42:33 Trump knew that this would help his buddies make money on their selling of stocks. Still don’t know why America thinks trump cares about you!
4868 2018-03-02 18:41:48 Companies buying back their own stocks at the highest price levels in history makes very little sense.

Buy backs also take away from R&D investments. Artificially propping up your stock price with buy backs is only good in the short term...

#StockMarket #stockbuyback
4869 2018-03-02 18:41:29 And it’s a good thing that he his going forward with banning bump stocks and increasing the age limit. It’s a start. But that doesn’t eliminate the threat of gun violence. Besides the NRA has opposed both of the above.
4870 2018-03-02 18:41:25 I would love to see that happen, but I don’t think it will. Maybe the extra background checks and bump stocks, but the rest will be a tough road ahead. Maybe these kids can get it done during their lifetimes. Especially since so many will be voting age this year.
4871 2018-03-02 18:41:19 Is that that all? I hope that’s not everything! Please tell me there’s another part that raises the purchasing age to 21, getting rid of bump stocks, harder background checks, and closing gun show loopholes? Anything on gun reform at all?
4872 2018-03-02 18:39:25 But steel stocks have gone up in value, as they were expected to, so not sure this connection is valid. If he had bought up a bunch would be different, yes?
4873 2018-03-02 18:39:22 Despite the big decline in Stocks this morning, Mortgage Bond prices are flat to slightly lower. Floating is recommended.
4874 2018-03-02 18:39:20 Maybe they should sell those stocks, take their profit, and put it into something else.  It is a free country.  Stop with all the boo hoo shit because our trade agreements are a total rape job.
4875 2018-03-02 18:39:19 Meanwhile the worst leader ever Trump has been blamed despite aiming to ban Gun stocks and increasing the age limit,and still gets stick for it.
Not denying the fact that Obama was one of the most vocal people about stricter gun laws.
4876 2018-03-02 18:39:19 I’m ambivalent on bump stocks. Honestly if a school shooter used bump stocks, there would be more opportunities to tackle them (while reloading).
4877 2018-03-02 18:39:12 Buys stocks for the first time ... Trump starts trade wars ...
4878 2018-03-02 18:38:46 yeah but steel stocks are up!
4879 2018-03-02 18:38:46 @theCMAF - don't worry, you won't miss too many "fans"!

4885 2018-03-02 18:38:09 It's just *baffling* to me that we are just getting daily headlines "stocks plunge as..." "stocks rally from yesterdays low as..." and not "unusual pattern of stock market volatility continues"
4886 2018-03-02 18:37:57 We have some and freezer stocks if you need 
4887 2018-03-02 18:37:38 Hearing such ignorance abt so-called "Assault Rifles" from a State AG is disturbing. @NRA should provide AG Bondi with some education on how to protect the #2ndA rights of FL citizens who own AR15's.
FYI: Bump stocks will be regulated by the ATF & restricted w/full auto weapons.

4890 2018-03-02 18:36:13 You could have made the case that tariffs would be good for the stocks. Markets are fickle that way.
4891 2018-03-02 18:36:05 No one wants to take hunting guns away or pistols. If you can't hunt with a gun why do you need it. If you think Bump stocks and fully automatic guns are what the Second Amendment are for you are wrong.
4892 2018-03-02 18:35:59 Ever notice that there is always plenty of liquidity and never any algo involvement when stocks are going up?
4893 2018-03-02 18:35:56 'I CAN show how Much I benefited from insider trading of Irish Bank stocks; enough to buy Budweiser!'
4894 2018-03-02 18:35:47 That's a really good point, and just 1 piece of the "HTF do we fix this???" puzzle. People w personality disorders have potential to be dangerous with any weapon. Diagnosis and treatment have to be priorities along with restricted access. And no more bump stocks or semis. 1/2
4895 2018-03-02 18:35:43 Obama wanted to stop large arms dealers from selling military weapons and republicans flipped out.  Trump plans to ban bump stocks through executive order and you hillbillies don't say shit lol fuckin idiots

4902 2018-03-02 18:33:23 Seems to be what the stocks are for
4903 2018-03-02 18:33:23 Donald Trump & Wilbur Ross are 2 dumb fucks. Stocks start to normalize then they start a trade war with steel & aluminum tariffs.  Americans, when you’re out of work because of this trade war-please vote this dumb fuck out of office.  I think the Taj Mahal makes sense to you now.
4904 2018-03-02 18:33:14 Did the trumps dump their stocks too?
4905 2018-03-02 18:32:59 @keywonc hi -- would like to interview you for a HuffPost story on goodbye gun stocks. Can you reach out to me at ann.brenoff@huffpost.com -- asap? thx
4906 2018-03-02 18:32:50 Yes, Ichann likely whispered it in his ear, and knowing he would respond dumped his stocks. Trump probably doesn't have a clue that he was used and possibly complicit in something illegal. Probably just the way Putin has played this fool.
4907 2018-03-02 18:32:41 His Buddy, Carl Icahn, dumped Millions of Dollars into Steal Stocks just PRIOR to TREASONTRUMP instituting TARIFF
4908 2018-03-02 18:32:32 Bump stocks have the added effect of making the gun horribly inaccurate. Vegas was unique because the shooter was at an elevated position and there was a dense kill box. You also have to reload often, which is another reason school shooters haven’t used bump stocks.
4909 2018-03-02 18:32:24 ill leave bye

4916 2018-03-02 18:30:52 can you teach me how to buy stocks pweez
4917 2018-03-02 18:30:20 I'm reasonable, I just want bump stocks, high capacity mags, age limits, and mental health to be considered. Whatever prevents future Nicholas Cruzes and Steven Paddocks without infringing on hunting, self defense and temp breakdown. The military will not turn on us. They are us.
4918 2018-03-02 18:29:57 Trump confidant dumped millions in steel-related stock last week. 45 no  longer wants to be or cares about being the president of OUR USA. Get  rid of him. Lock him up. I am sure he is 1/2 share holder of those  stocks. @Mueller  Time to get the financials.
4919 2018-03-02 18:29:46 Looks like Carl Icahn just did an insider trading sale of steel stocks last week before his buddy, donald, announced a tariff on steel. Who's going to prosecute him for it?
4920 2018-03-02 18:29:31 Trump confidant dumped millions in steel-related stock last week. 45 no longer wants to be or cares about being the president of OUR USA. Get rid of him. Lock him up. I am sure he is 1/2 share holder of those stocks. @Mueller  Time to get the financials.
4921 2018-03-02 18:29:14 I'm no expert, but this is clearly "insider trading" or the equivalent for dumping stocks before bad news affecting those stocks.
4922 2018-03-02 18:28:58 STOCKS:  The republicans really really need us to buy more stocks so the stock market is higher going into the elections.  Their PAC will try to prop the market to offset foreigners selling.  They also need us to buy stuff so the economy is booming.  @DNC @TheDemCoalition
4923 2018-03-02 18:28:43 I wish I could buy stocks in Josh Brolin.
4924 2018-03-02 18:28:28 Both Bullish reasonable. But I have never heard stocks guys talking about Lambo-Moon-Rocket-1M-Eat-Public-TV and all that. In stocks people are happy when they get 10% PA. Here everyone is ready for rocket to launch to moon. Noone talk of moon in stocks

4928 2018-03-02 18:28:19 Who took a short position on stocks affected by the tariffs before the announcement? Check on that Andrea and get back with me.
4929 2018-03-02 18:28:05 I'm low on stocks here cud do with them myself
4930 2018-03-02 18:27:37 Sure. I bet you had a lot of Delta stocks. Lmao
4931 2018-03-02 18:27:34 And isn't it convenient that several Sentators and WH Officials sold their metal stocks only a few days before this was announced?  Isn't that called "Insider Trading"?  Hmmm.
4932 2018-03-02 18:27:30 **Trump SAYS: Will Ban Bump Stocks....A Deflectionary Trick? Probably
   Trump Says(To GOP in Congress):These Guys(NRA)have Power Over          You,Not Me.....Only HALF-Right. NRA Holds Even Trump in their Fist
Trump:NRA waiting to Do What's Right?-ROFLMAO!
4933 2018-03-02 18:27:19 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
4934 2018-03-02 18:26:52 made like 3 or 4 investments in a few different stocks
4935 2018-03-02 18:26:51 banning the weapons won't do anything,  neither will banning bump stocks.   Bump stocks are horribly inaccurate.  If you can join the military at 17 u r saying when they return home at 20 they can purchase a firearm.   Stupid!
4936 2018-03-02 18:26:11 Icahn dumps millions of steel stocks before tariffs are announced.

Kushner's company gets millions in loans after White House meetings. Pipeline regulations are cut, a boon to firm that gave the loan.

@GOP and gov't spend heavily at Trump properties.

This is kleptocracy 
4937 2018-03-02 18:25:54 La seule vraie "restriction", c'est que c'est les collections de la saison précédente, mais bon, ça...
Et aussi que les stocks sont assez restreints, je rage encore du domicile du Zenith qu'ils avaient qu'en XXL
4938 2018-03-02 18:25:43 They are free to buy stocks. Too many play the lottery and eat fast food instead.
4939 2018-03-02 18:25:39 How about Icahn's selling off of steels stocks?  That's worth investigating.  Icahn seems determined to make money off Trump's "presidency".
4940 2018-03-02 18:25:14 Yep i have loaaads of screen shots of my charts but they all seem redundant now as stocks dont play out like they did. My discipline is terrible
4941 2018-03-02 18:25:11 He told his friends before he did it and they sold millions of stocks.

4943 2018-03-02 18:24:48 He knows. He just doesn’t give a rat’s ass.  If he told Carl Icahn, who else did he tell & give the opportunity to dump stocks?  Sell high & buy low.

4945 2018-03-02 18:24:17 Is Trump trying to recover some of the gift he gave to companies and its stockholders?  (Disclosure: I am a. Stockholder and the tax cuts have been good to me) ... but teachers I don’t believe they have much stocks, so they are protesting.

4947 2018-03-02 18:24:01 I’d love to see the crystal ball that tells you when periods of market volatility are going to happen before they do and when they’re going to end. Otherwise you’re just selling after the downturn and buying stocks once they’ve recovered. sell low buy high an interesting strategy
4948 2018-03-02 18:23:09 They’ll take bump stocks off the market, throw more money at background checks and that’ll be it.
4949 2018-03-02 18:23:09 You clowns do understand that with bonuses and increased pay/take home pay, most of these workers (shareholders) also have these stocks in their 401k plan, right? People's 401k plan's are doing great; the best in a long time. Why is that so bad?
4950 2018-03-02 18:23:06 Why did insiders dump their steel stocks last week??? You are a criminal.

4961 2018-03-02 18:17:55 @nra @realDonaldTrump @DanaRohrabacher The retailers taking steps to curb semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks are sending a message to the nation. In my opinion, they are going to lead. When are our representatives going to do likewise? Give the NRA, and their money the boot.

4969 2018-03-02 18:16:43 So, what corporations are doing with this extra wealth from the GOP tax scam is buyback stocks and purchase other companies. A handful have given out $1000 bonuses. CEO’s told Mnuchin going in that they weren’t spending it on reinvestment
4970 2018-03-02 18:16:33 The turtle would have dumped his steel stocks and made lots of money. The End.
4971 2018-03-02 18:16:27 That is silly.  We consume at a much higher rate.  Much of that money that goes out comes back in supporting lower interest rates and investment in our stocks.  Trade deficits aren't a new thing, our economy has outperformed virtually every nation on the face of earth.
4972 2018-03-02 18:16:26 Last week he bought stocks in steel check on that please
4973 2018-03-02 18:16:01 A likely explanation: Increased volatility is coming from systematic rather than idiosyncratic effects; hence, more shared volatility across stocks.
4974 2018-03-02 18:15:55 that's pretty dumb. Steel stocks went up.

4979 2018-03-02 18:13:56 My stocks have been taking one hit after the next. Trumphumpers don't complain because they know between mishandling guns and meth they won't live to see retirement
4980 2018-03-02 18:13:56 1. You didn’t write this tweet on your own, because “reciprocal” is spelled correctly and used in proper context, and 2.  Nice job on the insider trading with your buddy that dumped his steel stocks last week.
4981 2018-03-02 18:13:37 So he gets to pick the next chief of the agency that might be inclined to investigate his dumping of steel stocks?

4996 2018-03-02 18:11:05 We would agree that day trading is tough. We like trading stocks with a little longer time period. Hope all your trades are going well.
4997 2018-03-02 18:10:57 Fast forward to after LasVegas, countless mass shootings after Sandy hook. Still very little talk about gun bans, but lots of talk about bump stocks and background checks. NRA and conservatives still saying we are trying to get rid of the 2nd amendment and take away their guns.
4998 2018-03-02 18:10:23 Bullied as ppl hold money for student music programs unless they get their way. True racist behavior as always accuse those of what you are doing

5000 2018-03-02 18:09:59 Tip off your friends so they can dump their stocks in steel before losing money. Allow a security risk son in law to secure loans for his family's business in return for favors while in the WH. Punish your enemies. What a guy!
5001 2018-03-02 18:09:54 Oh. Will #Dow be up or down 400 at end of day, or somewhere in between? I don't know, though I have been buying on weakness. Whatever it does has NO significance as to longer term health of #economy or #stocks. Just whichever way momentum turns.
5002 2018-03-02 18:09:40 @CNN why don’t you all talk about how after tRUMP put tariffs on steel and aluminum his buddy Carl Icahn his confidant dumps his steel and aluminum stocks before the announcement.
5003 2018-03-02 18:09:37 Yeah we know.  Carl Icahn dump his stocks. Did Putin do the same?
5004 2018-03-02 18:09:36 Who took a short position on stocks affected by the tariffs before the announcement? Check on that politico and get back with me. Let’s get real. This gun control bs will end up getting twisted to work against a select group of ppl.
5005 2018-03-02 18:09:11 It's just stocks, gradients and grain. Ew.

5010 2018-03-02 18:08:13 So does buying stocks in American companies.
5011 2018-03-02 18:07:56 @LidlUK witnessed customer in your Falkirk shop allowed to buy 10 bottles of milk this morning when stocks were already low due to weather.. other customers only wanting to buy one bottle leaving emptyhanded.. please get your act together!
5012 2018-03-02 18:07:43 TRUMP rides POTUS BARACK OBAMA'S economic coattails, takes credit for Obama's successes. Now he opens his mouth about trade wars and sends stocks down. He didn't think American steel and workers were so important for his own buildings!
5013 2018-03-02 18:07:24 Giant scam. Tariffs = stocks fall. Then buy, then tariffs off = stocks soar. Trump's friends get richer. Follow the money. Corruption and insider trading.
5014 2018-03-02 18:07:19 VIX back into negative territory near 21, stocks are rising and the "risk off" sentiment is backing off; That's allowing grains to come off their lows, altho wheat still taking a beating as traders focus on slow exports amid current prices and big old-crop stocks. #OATT

Then we have to worry about trade Wars around the world thanks to Trump. Every trading country around the world have taken up arms against Trump Tariffs. U S Stocks as I said would crash it did. Sad day for our country
5017 2018-03-02 18:06:24 More virtual signaling from investment firms that have pumped money hand over fist into alcohol and tobacco stocks for years. Each of which kills more people than guns.
5018 2018-03-02 18:05:43 Thanks, bought in the new Hornsey High Street store - which is lovely by the way and stocks a great free from range!

There are way too many ways to trade that we can easily get caught up in wanting to make money on them all, but I PROMISE you consistent profitability will come if you only take A++ setups. #stocks
5020 2018-03-02 18:05:33 Steve, you are 100% CORRECT!
Thank you for sending out this tweet.
I hope people can relax and go back to what they do best.  Buy more stocks today so you can recoup your loses from  yesterday mistakes.

5025 2018-03-02 18:03:41 The yield curve is flattening, and it could invert as hikes continue, which is why I think Fed hikes now pose a danger to both stocks and bonds. Inversions often preceded recessions.
5026 2018-03-02 18:03:08 Wow @jonnajarian with all the stocks and trading options in the world you pick shorting the $VIX. I'm against you on this one, no offense but I hope you get your face ripped off on this one.
5027 2018-03-02 18:02:59 No concerns I have no stocks! I won’t gamble!
5028 2018-03-02 18:02:32 Heck yeh and later he could even announce he just changed his mind, but his buddies could pickup a few cheap stocks after the crash!
5029 2018-03-02 18:01:37 "stocks trying to stage a comeback" says @cnbc never mind that 2000 basket is +1.2%.
5030 2018-03-02 18:01:27 I was just thinking that earlier.

I wish I sold my steel stocks before these Obama tariffs were announced.
5031 2018-03-02 18:01:20 You canae have it both ways. One day Companies are being told to keep lorries off the road, and you wonder why stocks of perishable goods are running out.  People genuinely panic buying does not help.

5033 2018-03-02 18:01:13 Oh yeah that's the hardest part about calling stocks publicly and in beginning was very hard for me, don't want anyone to lose money cause I made a bad call so I am careful, but you can't always win, today was a win though for sure!
5034 2018-03-02 18:00:50 What shared stocks?
5035 2018-03-02 18:00:49 Stocks continue to sink as investors fears on Trump trade war grows
5036 2018-03-02 18:00:30 Ban bump stocks, ban extended clips, ban military style assault rifles. 21 age limit to purchase any fire arm, extensive comprehensive background check including restraining orders and mental health issues. Registration for all gun sales including family.
5037 2018-03-02 18:00:24 U.S. Stocks decline on President Trump's tariff headlines. Consumer Sentiment at frothy levels. Fed Chairman Powell says he doesn't see econ
5038 2018-03-02 17:59:38 Again, I am so glad that I have no stocks in a Company run by Leftists..
5039 2018-03-02 17:59:37 Weekend market recaps will talk about stocks rebounding from Trump's tariff scare - little focus on the real drivers of this weeks action (currencies, intervention)
5040 2018-03-02 17:59:36 Wayne La Pierre the spokesman for one. Guns are a GOD given right..?  His speech he gave? Just think how terrorists sound to us when they throw the Allah/God is behind us speech?

LV turned into a war zone &NOTHING done b/c of NRA. Not even outlaw bump stocks

NRA look like loons
5041 2018-03-02 17:59:28 Follow the money: Stocks fall, Trump friends buy up cheap stock. Next week, Trump announces tariffs are off. Stocks soar, his friends make money. Insider trading and corruption. Do your job and investigate.
5042 2018-03-02 17:59:17 Cut the S**T Teddy, maybe you should worry more about the HELL HOLE your state is becoming. Homeless AMERICANS all through your Cities, ILLEGAL CRIMINALS being protected, while AMERICANS are Slaughtered by them, MS13 running wild, And YOUR worried about someone's Stocks!
5043 2018-03-02 17:58:54 Bullshit. How about we authorize A stocks at using units to stop everything from always backordering and take some pressure off the intermediate level? Definitely couldn't hurt readiness.
5044 2018-03-02 17:58:37 Yeah that might not help. Crazy P/Es definitely make Stocks a target when Markets get grumpy.
5045 2018-03-02 17:58:11 it's a guy that makes 26,000 a day just shorting stocks... you can make a lot but in order to make a lot you need a lot basically. Go by % returns instead of dollar amounts. that will show the true story.
5046 2018-03-02 17:57:30 All of Trump's friends are done short selling & then buying back their steel/aluminum stocks.
5047 2018-03-02 17:57:08 Stocks continue to fall, and Trump thinks the country is in good shape. We were better 2 years ago under Obama.
5048 2018-03-02 17:56:59 You know what Sven? I read his letter the other day and it strikes me that we should read little into what Buffett is doing. Rather, concentrate on what he's not doing - which is buying stocks.
5049 2018-03-02 17:56:56 @chrislhayes Thing 1: Carl Icahn dumps $31 Million in steel stocks days before tariff announcement.
5050 2018-03-02 17:56:43 Who took a short position on stocks affected by the tariffs before the announcement? Check on that Jake and get back with me.
5051 2018-03-02 17:55:50 Ok, stocks are up and the TV punditry can relax. Their 401ks are not going to hell in a hand-basket because of Trump trade wars. Phew. Glad we dodged that one!
5052 2018-03-02 17:55:30 Once Wall Street figures out Trump is right about tariffs stocks will resume its upward climb regardless of the current MSM hysteria
5053 2018-03-02 17:55:13 The Dow Has Shed 1,100 Points In Three Days!1 of his best friends sold off his steel stocks a couple of days before sanctions were announce

5056 2018-03-02 17:54:34 Your buddy just made big money selling steel stocks before this announcement...Coincidence?...

5058 2018-03-02 17:53:49 @lee_moran What chaos in WH?Its a lie,AGAIN!Another fake news story to make ppl believe Trumps a fool!ITS THE OPPOSITE MORON!Economy!Stocks!Jobs!WE KNOW THE TRUTH,AND THE LIES YOU AND YOUR COHORTS ARE TELLING TO FOOL US!
5059 2018-03-02 17:53:45 Yup earlier I was positionally a option seller .. made a million in 6 months lost half in matter of 2-3 months .. left that .. option selling was without any charts basically stated with hedging pf stocks and psychology made me sold naked options after some success ..
5060 2018-03-02 17:53:38 Congratulations on the Puzzle! What about following the money on the drop in the stock market after Trump's tariff announcement? Wilbur Ross knew he was going to make that announcement? I wonder what stocks Ross shorted...
5061 2018-03-02 17:53:28 We're excited that our CIO  @BryanHinmon will be back on the @ChuckJaffe show next week! #stocks
5062 2018-03-02 17:53:17 Another Freaky Friday? Markets clawing back to the green RIGHT NOW, DOW was down 300pts, now -65. It's a can't-miss 3pET to see if stocks can flip higher @ClamanCountdown
5063 2018-03-02 17:53:06 Shorting stocks, a tutorial.
5064 2018-03-02 17:52:54 They’re grabbing it all before they are forced out; Ichan dumped stocks in companies relying on steel imports days before Trump’s embargo
5065 2018-03-02 17:52:32 My complete watchlist consisting of roughly 35 speculative stocks is green as the nasdaq leads the show. Who cares about the dow and tariffs when you have such action in small and medium size businesses!
5066 2018-03-02 17:52:19 We are “rich” NYers who are benefiting from the bump in stocks (before trump ruined it with the tariffs)- so thanks for that. Our kids will pay the price though, when the deficit blows up and they have to pay.
5067 2018-03-02 17:51:58 I see certain stocks continue to be absolutely ridiculous, like $MU and $NFLX $QQQ
5068 2018-03-02 17:51:49 Trump advisor Carl Icahn got away with his biofuel credit insider trading heist so naturally he's out there dumping steel stocks just before Trump announces his punitive #tariffs. These robber baron oligarchs of ours are not subtle.
5069 2018-03-02 17:51:20 this is the millenial equivalent of putting put in the stocks in the town square
5070 2018-03-02 17:50:54 The SEC should began a preliminary fact finding probe into all of the steel and aluminum executives who dumped stocks and shares over the past three months. I would guarantee you that there are irregularities looming.
5071 2018-03-02 17:50:49 @fbi  Follow the money. Maybe the real intention here was to drive down all stocks and create chaos. Then friends buy up cheap stock. Next week, tariffs are off and stocks soar, then sold. Corruption.
5072 2018-03-02 17:50:44 Stocks still the focus. Could be a bad weekly close. All this due to Trump tariff talk
5073 2018-03-02 17:50:37 Stocks still the focus. Could be a bad weekly close. All this due to Trump tariff talk.
5074 2018-03-02 17:50:24 hey idiot,, $100 billion "down in trade" means $100 billion up on capital account - $100 billion more in foreign purchases of our stocks, bonds, golf courses, real estate (imagine that) etc. You cut $100 billion of their trade surplus you cut $100 billion of investment in America
5075 2018-03-02 17:50:09 Dump some of your stocks, that'll relieve some of that pressure.
5076 2018-03-02 17:49:53 Meanwhile - one of Trumps buddies dumps a ton f his steel stocks the week prior.  By the Time Trump is through with his chaos ..... America will look like the Taj Mahal AC
5077 2018-03-02 17:49:52 Very funny. Trump’s Chief economic adviser tried to dissuade Trump. Stocks have dropped dramatically & many Republicans in Congress disagree. No one wins in a trade war particularly American consumers.
5078 2018-03-02 17:49:29 Imagine if DTCC, ACH or BIS adopt blockchain technologies.

We could be looking at 1 day settlemend for stocks, same day settlement for options and 2 day settlement for bank transfers withing 24 months.
5079 2018-03-02 17:49:21 Yeah I don't consider ute stocks to be a good investment at present low yields and high P/Es. It is not a good setup for rising rates and inflation which are Kryptonite for utes.
5080 2018-03-02 17:49:01 I love when Tmobile gives us stocks as a bonus!! #UnCarrier #TMobile
5081 2018-03-02 17:48:54 I was just sitting here wondering who had profited or who had shorted the stocks, 
5082 2018-03-02 17:48:53 Interesting how Trump’s long time confidant Carl Icahn sold over $30 of steel stocks days before this announcement
5083 2018-03-02 17:48:36 Wouldn't be surprised if one of Trump's comrades has shorted some key stocks...
Spaseeba...pazhalooysta
5084 2018-03-02 17:47:39 @Lawrence @KatyTurNBC Carl Icahn sells off steel related stocks week before Trump tariff announcement. Coincidence? #TrumpSwamp
5085 2018-03-02 17:47:37 That's nice, and along with Trump's friend selling millions of dollars in Steel Stocks last week, Mueller's going to be a busy man. 
5086 2018-03-02 17:47:16 The Blanket seemed to cover quite a few of my Stocks  ;-)))
5087 2018-03-02 17:47:14 Looks like I called it on the stock manipulation by Trump; his buddy Icahn dumped his steel stock before the announcement, and steel stocks will go back up after he buys it back and Trump changes his mind on the tariffs
5088 2018-03-02 17:46:20 We must learn from history. Once our guns are taken away then our freedom will be too. Am I a gun fanatic? No. I support tougher background checks, a waiting period, and honestly don't care is bump stocks are banned. Chicago has the Toughest gun laws. Evil doesn't abide the law.
5089 2018-03-02 17:46:20 ILST-cant wait 90 days. an this team necessary. LOL ADTM longs. MSPC JAMN? IDGC tu ave safe weekends.
5090 2018-03-02 17:46:15 well, others opinions do impact valuations prior to maturity, but there is a definite maturity separate from mrMarket, vs stocks which must be sold
5091 2018-03-02 17:45:26 I love it when the whole classroom talks about stocks, may SENSE ang pinag-uusapan. 
5092 2018-03-02 17:45:20 It’s always impressive to see which stocks show resiliency.
5093 2018-03-02 17:45:14 Any opinion on $NDX? The tech stocks show no correction! $SHOP, $AMZN, $AAPL with tremendous resilience despite fireworks in every other index!
5094 2018-03-02 17:45:14 Not to mention Carl Icahn dumping stocks last week before steel tariff announcement.
5095 2018-03-02 17:45:14 Of course.  There will always be winners and losers..most of the wealth generated now is from Wall Street gains .  Most people don’t have stocks
5096 2018-03-02 17:45:06 He’s had a bad presidency so far. The only thing good he has done is his talk (and yess his talk is cheAp) of banning bump stocks and raising the age to buy semi-auto rifles.
5097 2018-03-02 17:44:46 I go to the American General Store because I need a new Bible. I find out the store no longer stocks them because an Evangelical Atheist group threatened a national boycott if they did.
5098 2018-03-02 17:44:09 Ibebenta ko na stocks ko sa CA sa Monday at a lower price kahit lugi n ako. Palugi ng palugi na eh!!! 
5099 2018-03-02 17:43:54 I am not happy with this crowd. I'm not a stocks kind of person, but even I heard Trump threaten tariffs on things like steel and oddly, air conditioners.
5100 2018-03-02 17:43:21 NFLX was one of the strongest high beta stocks the past couple of weeks  and loss the least amount percentage wise during this pull back -  think it will be fairly strong rest of day
5101 2018-03-02 17:43:16 I am wondering should we ban 3d printers now?, because they can just 3d print bump stocks.
5102 2018-03-02 17:43:14 I just built around the big tree in the centre and ignored most of the rest of it. I also built a hotel with a secret hidden sex dungeon and put that whiny bastard Jun Long in the stocks down there next to a powerfist and let nature take its course...
5103 2018-03-02 17:42:37 The liberal cockrouchs are out again #MAGA spray them with RAID. The idiots about the stock market crash, they must not own stocks at all or they have junk stocks I seem to be way up still and looking for bargains on the dips. It's not a stairway to heaven folks it's normal
5104 2018-03-02 17:42:26 Completely sane.  Some regulations should be set forth for gun owners such as modifications and what not to change the actions of certain firearms...like bump stocks.  Not needed.  But.  Guns are indeed not an entire problem.
5105 2018-03-02 17:42:02 "Bolt action rifles? This is 2018, we hunt deer with laser sights and bump stocks, you mewling libs!"
5106 2018-03-02 17:41:51 What I'm waiting for is an unwind with the tech stocks. S&P500 got some catch up to do. With fx I'm watching GbpUsd for some more downside.
5107 2018-03-02 17:41:39 I wonder how many Oligarchs hold big positions in Steel & Aluminum who shorted their stocks last week knowing this was coming. Trying to stay in good standing with his FSB handlers as to not be exposed by Putin.
5108 2018-03-02 17:41:38 Curious about what stocks Trump family members are trading these days........
5109 2018-03-02 17:41:21 Was it the commerce chief that told him to dump all 45's aluminum and steel stocks the day before he announced tariff's? Martha Stewart much?
5110 2018-03-02 17:41:18 "Bump stocks"? 
5111 2018-03-02 17:41:13 3D Systems Corp (DDD) up 5.87% 11.37 per share #stocks
5112 2018-03-02 17:40:44 Like all tariffs, it creates a few winners (inefficient steel producers) and many, many losers (everyone who uses steel in any of their products and services). This is why Trump insiders would have been dumping the stocks of any companies that use lots of steel.
5113 2018-03-02 17:40:41 #crypto goes sideways while my stocks that i hold go up!! honestly traditional #securities are not that bad
5114 2018-03-02 17:40:36 Stocks do go up & down
5115 2018-03-02 17:40:29 meanwhile, as the .@NewYorkFed primes stocks for minimal losses into the weekend... UST10Y prints at 2.861
5116 2018-03-02 17:40:10 Be thankful for these volatile times across stocks, cryptos and lots of other markets. These are times that can make your year and decade.
5117 2018-03-02 17:40:10 Old man in Las Vegas. Still selling bumps stocks, semi automatics,no background checks. That's the problem. You can join the Army at 18. Smoke and mirrors.
5118 2018-03-02 17:40:02 A handful of patience is worth a bushel of brains - Dutch Proverb. #stocks #investing
5119 2018-03-02 17:39:18 “We’re like #WarrenBuffett. But instead of investing in value stocks we lose money on crypto, and instead of writing annual letters we write daily tweets. We’re nothing like Warren Buffett.” #QuoteOfTheDay @MorningBrew 
5120 2018-03-02 17:38:33 Blackrock activist role against guns is its more PR since many of the manufactures (stocks) are in and out of bankruptcy filings over their history.  Why own their stocks anyway.  Dump the stocks to feel better about yourself?
5121 2018-03-02 17:37:59 "Trump says he'll ban bump stocks through executive order."  Is that true or are you lying just like the 12 women who said they were groped by you. @NRA
5122 2018-03-02 17:37:32 Why not just start an ETF that holds all the non-firearm producing stocks, instead?
5123 2018-03-02 17:37:11 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are dropping like your name is plastered on them.
5124 2018-03-02 17:36:37 I've been waiting to get into these stocks. Shld be huge growth ahead imo
5125 2018-03-02 17:36:26 You know markets are efficient because stocks started rallying the minute Wilbur Ross took out a can of soup from his man-bag
5126 2018-03-02 17:36:11 I heard Icahn (spelling?) dumped huge amount of stocks just before tRump announcement...insider trading?
5127 2018-03-02 17:36:09 Check it out. At one of his speeches early 2017, said "watch out for the stock market,it'll hurt you" Trump didn't make his money on stocks. He could care less if the market plummets.
5128 2018-03-02 17:36:06 Sad, except for his friends who sold their steel stocks last week. It's like they knew something like this was coming
5129 2018-03-02 17:36:02 Keep in mind some people love stocks to Gap, but they pretty much buying the night before in hopes of a gap so they can sell into the gap, then once gap fills (u back where stock traded night before lets say) u will see buying- I prefer no morning gaps, but its not worst thing
5130 2018-03-02 17:35:32 So you bought stocks on a Friday with VIX over 20 and on Friday night Trump makes the innocuous announcement that the US is pulling out of NAFTA. How do you think Monday on the open plays out?

5132 2018-03-02 17:35:06 US stocks drop sharply on trade war fears
5133 2018-03-02 17:34:50 Important day for the markets. $IWM, ($RUT) showing strong relative strength so far. That is a positive for stocks today. There is still a lot of time before the closing bell.
5134 2018-03-02 17:34:34 thanks, i ll register when i ll retire and do only US stocks...based in London and looking at European stocks...another world...so fewer good candidate for swing trading!
5135 2018-03-02 17:34:31 Trump as well, as he probably passed on information related to his decision which would negatively affect steel and aluminum stocks to his pal.
5136 2018-03-02 17:34:28 So basically just like the #GOPTaxScam this helps his rich friends AGAIN. Not to mention giving a tip off to his friends so they could sell their stocks before everyone else, but hey with all of Trump crimes where does insider trading rank. #GOPGrifters
5137 2018-03-02 17:34:09 Stops fine. Especially for individual stocks. I don't use stops now, Larry, because I'm in ETF's (and some smaller % in MF's). Why I don't is traders can get burned in flash crashes, like in 2010. Horrible fills and then it shoots right back up.
5138 2018-03-02 17:33:48 Once there was a time where only white men were allowed to vote. Now look where we are at. Things can change. Like banning bump stocks and making it harder for people to semi automatics. Doesn’t mean people are taking guns away from responsible gun owners.
5139 2018-03-02 17:33:43 After R/S maybe. So many other stocks to consider
5140 2018-03-02 17:33:37 And the stocks of steel dependent companies dropped significantly with the tariff announcement.  I can't see any meaningful point in your comment....
5141 2018-03-02 17:33:23 Didn't Martha Stewart go to jail for exactly this?  Only she wasn't president, and actually controlling the rise and fall of the stocks
5142 2018-03-02 17:33:16 The thing with two guys getting into a fist fight next to you on the subway is that I haven't scrolled through my Stocks app in forever.
5143 2018-03-02 17:33:00 President Trump said  while running for President at just one speech,"Watch out for the stock market,it'll hurt you." He didn't make his  money with stocks. He cares not for them. Couldn't give a sh*t.
5144 2018-03-02 17:32:39 Alright, just get ready for lost jobs, a trade war, and tanking stocks. The "forgotten men" you claim to fight for will be paying more now for the same items they were already getting. Idiot.
5145 2018-03-02 17:32:36 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
5146 2018-03-02 17:32:08 USDCHF recovers to the 200 hour MA as fears subside 200 hour MA tested
The USDCHF was hit hard on the dollar selloff earlier in the day. As some of the tariff fears subside, and the stocks rebounded, so has the USDCHF.
5147 2018-03-02 17:32:01 Thank you for your last information about 1 million options to quote. I was wondering just how many were out there. How many stocks/etfs are there quote?
5148 2018-03-02 17:31:38 An 18 year old with a history of violence buying a semi-auto rifle with no background checks and no way to stop him, and then potentially adding things like bump stocks, infrared scopes, silencers, extended mags, etc all so he can MURDER people seems like a pretty extreme case.
5149 2018-03-02 17:30:59 Ok i thought u would be selecting stocks from news.. Thank you my dear sir
5150 2018-03-02 17:30:29 Pretty lucky that you and your colleagues dumped steel stocks just a day or two before your ‘speech’ on tariffs...
5151 2018-03-02 17:30:24 ... trade stocks on not yet Public info. Don’t we have a name for that?
5152 2018-03-02 17:30:16 AR15 are not used by the military. We already have background checks. We already have to wait 10 days to purchase a gun. No one even heard about bump stocks until LV. They make your weapon incredibly inaccurate. Most pistols have a larger caliber bullet than AR15s. Any questions?

5154 2018-03-02 17:30:03 I found also newsworthy the fact the sheriff Israel ordered his deputies to stand down..Agree? As for selling stocks it wasn't a secret the president would do something about steel
5155 2018-03-02 17:29:49 $ xiv raid? so you are telling me that the stocks dropping and the vix rally was all about the little $ in the vix and the SVXY? yeah sure.. 3 years of straight up in the stock market couldn't have anything to do with it? NO. oh yeah about that TULIP RAID!!

5157 2018-03-02 17:29:33 That's funny, I once had a dream that JJ Abrams was telling me that life was like stocks. You make a decision and have to wait to see how it plays out in the long run.

(It is still one of the wisest things anyone has said to me in a dream, right behind Morgan Freeman. :) )
5158 2018-03-02 17:29:05 thats why I trade stocks
5159 2018-03-02 17:28:58 Im gloating over Donald Trump's failure as president. The stock market fell for the second day in the row. Take heart Donald Trump! While other stocks fell sharply, PREPERATION "H" STOCKS went up sharply. HA HA HA HA
5160 2018-03-02 17:28:29 Trade wars are good, absolutely - for some people: Mr @realDonaldTrump's confident Carl Ichan who dumped a lot of metal related stocks a few days ago, for one example - they are good.  And they hurt almost everyone else!  Companies don't absorb the taxes: they hike prices!
5161 2018-03-02 17:28:21 My personal plea to @VAHouseDems and @deltoscano : Do not let up! Keep fighting, do not let them silence you! 97% of Americans believe we should have stronger background checks, 82% support ban on bump stocks, 68% support assault gun ban. Thank you for being our voice!
5162 2018-03-02 17:27:58 .@Equifax found 2M more personal information stolen by hackers, got hacked twice real quick and their stocks are still going up?

Who the hell would be buying into a company who uses admin/admin as their login info?

Should be selling off these stocks of this untrustworthy Corp.
5163 2018-03-02 17:27:57 News people should ask Wilbur and Carl Icon about HOW much money they made in the stock market by trading steel and Aluminum stocks with their prior knowledge that the @realDonaldTrump 's Tariffs are coming!
5164 2018-03-02 17:27:45 Sadly no...
5165 2018-03-02 17:27:28 Trump's deflecting himself and his  buddy Ichan just made a mint on Steel Stocks  probably insider trade 
plus Jared and Ivanka investigations
5166 2018-03-02 17:27:28 Are there any snacks he likes that are good for him? I’ve got a woman whose mother does the same- overfeeds the dog. But Lilly loves raw peapods, so Kris stocks up so the mother can still “spoil” Lilly.
5167 2018-03-02 17:27:23 I honestly didn’t get that worked up back then because 1: I was still working, and 2:  Even if I WERE nuts enough to get into dot-com stocks, I didn’t have enough money that I could afford to piss it away.
5168 2018-03-02 17:27:10 You are confusing stocks with flows. The "97% natural" is already in the cycle. Our CO2 emissions are additions to the cycle. Plants are not "adding" new CO2, they are just recycling it. Failing to recognize this fundamental point lacks credibility.
5169 2018-03-02 17:26:22 Stocks are going down down down because of this stupid move. Let cheap steel/AL come in so we can make products here cheaply and then export them.
5170 2018-03-02 17:26:16 These weren’t steel stocks.  It’s a global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions.  The article clearly articulated that.  They cost of their steel was just increased substantially.  Doesn’t take a genius to connect those dots.
5171 2018-03-02 17:26:16 the bounce in stocks is coming..paper gold retreating
5172 2018-03-02 17:26:10 Agree. Support some minor restrictions (eg ban bump stocks and sales to under-21s), then he has some great campaigning material, with minimal real damage to NRA relationship.
5173 2018-03-02 17:25:56 No more assault style rifles, no more school shootings, no more bump stocks, no more large magazines. We need background checks and sensible gun laws - and we don't need a lobby group forcing our representatives to not represent US! #NeverAGain
5174 2018-03-02 17:25:36 It doesn't seem to me that you are really showing any useful data. Some stocks have hundreds of calls and puts with different strikes and expiration dates. THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE SO MANY QUOTES.  People get quotes all the time for options but don't trade them all the time!
5175 2018-03-02 17:24:57 Damn he held those stocks 4 three years and never sold any shares until days b4 the announcement. That's definitely suspect.
5176 2018-03-02 17:24:50 $1000 bonus from tax cuts: NOT CRUMBS!!

$700 increase in cost of goods: NO BIG DEAL!!

Trading profits on steel related stocks: coincidence?
5177 2018-03-02 17:24:49 I need to invest in stocks @Starbucks because I already give them money, anyway. #Onmythirdcup
5178 2018-03-02 17:24:18 His buddy Carl Icahn sure make out good by dumping a lot of steel related stocks late week.  Sounds a bit fishy.  Can you "insider trading?"
5179 2018-03-02 17:24:01 If you want your Robinhood portfolio to look exciting like your #crypto portfolio just mix Weed stocks like IGC and CRON with the free referral stocks like GRPN and ZNGA weeeeeee!
5180 2018-03-02 17:23:56 Now, look at who dumped steel and aluminum stocks (and/or bet short) in the last 30 days.  With this administration, they probably all did it only 36 hours in advance...because nobody has ever reported them for any of the illegal crap they do before.
5181 2018-03-02 17:23:56 Trade war has been on for years ..America is losing due to unfair anti American trade policies. Trump is right..he looks ahead to bring back American jobs and strengthen our economy. Those who don't care about fair trade  probably own stocks in other countries manufacturing.
5182 2018-03-02 17:23:52 What new stocks have you guys been investing in?
5183 2018-03-02 17:23:33 OK. I'll play.

Stocks dropped because of the Fed, not Trump.

The world has NEVER HAD ANYTHERE NEAR THESE levels of debt, due to neat 0% interest loans during Obama's term.

Do you remember much of that pre-2009?

Enjoy your day.
5184 2018-03-02 17:23:33 You say life in America is great and then you make steel and aluminium more expensive. Stocks are going down now.
5185 2018-03-02 17:22:51 Toilet roll! Nobody ever stocks up on toilet roll!
5186 2018-03-02 17:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?
5187 2018-03-02 17:21:55 @NBCNews @NBCPolitics @NBCNightlyNews @TodayShowOnNBC @NBCNewsRadio 

OMG! Trump's buddy & supporter, Carl Icahn, dumped his steel related stocks before Trump made the announcement on STEEL TARIFFS! Hope you guys cover this.
5188 2018-03-02 17:21:28 What about Trump's friends that dumped steel stocks prior to the steel tarrif announcement? Bet they start buying again, then he backs down.
5189 2018-03-02 17:21:16 About to stock pile on bump stocks and AR's
5190 2018-03-02 17:21:04 @NewYork_SEC how can one of @realDonaldTrump advisors/cohorts sell his steel stocks last week, ahead of the tariffs announcement, not warrant some intense scrutiny from you. @AGSchneiderman are you interested in this seemingly strange coincidence? Insider info? @FBI
5191 2018-03-02 17:21:01 Saying "trade wars are good and easy to win" has to be one of the top 10 dumbest things @realDonaldTrump has said. Trade wars are bad for everyone...except your friends who dumped steel stocks a few days earlier. #unfitforoffice
5192 2018-03-02 17:20:59 @SamSchwartzCS where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
5193 2018-03-02 17:20:38 What about the thousands of rifles and bump stocks out there?
5194 2018-03-02 17:20:36 Stocks have become my new hobby
5195 2018-03-02 17:19:57 I’ve tried time and time again to explain to my grandma that if you gone invest in the market, you need to diversify. This lady has bought shares in 10 different stocks in the same industry. So when that industry is a bust, then what? 
5196 2018-03-02 17:19:56 So, Carl Ichann dumped some $30 million in steel-related stocks last week after chatting with you... making sure everyone you know goes to prison so you aren't lonely there?
5197 2018-03-02 17:19:52 I dont trade stocks higher than 5
5198 2018-03-02 17:19:44 @CBSNews @CBSEveningNews @CBSThisMorning @CBSPolitics @CBSNewsRadio

5199 2018-03-02 17:19:43 You can read all you want, keep saying you “get it”, and “yeah i know” to yourself but until you truly start to MANAGE RISK and look at limiting losses vs trying to “make money”, it won’t work. #study #stocks #learning

5203 2018-03-02 17:18:53 I want automatic weapons to be illegal along with bump stocks and banana clips.
5204 2018-03-02 17:18:34 @ABC @ABCWorldNews @ABCPolitics @GMA @ABCNewsRadio 

OMG! Trump's buddy & supporter, Carl Icahn, dumped his steel related stocks before Trump made the announcement on STEEL TARIFFS! Hope you guys cover this.
5205 2018-03-02 17:18:20 Sad but true... It was not always that way but, they are completely unreasonable. I spoke with them on the phone. Was told they don't want to ban bump stocks. They have no ideas to help reduce gun violence. They want to do the same thing and hope for a different result.
5206 2018-03-02 17:17:44 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
5207 2018-03-02 17:17:39 the only ones that win are the insiders like Ichan who just happened to dump $31M in steel stocks from Manitowoc days before the announcement.. Ichan also happens to be a good buddy buddy of Lord Dampnut.. sketchy much?!?
5208 2018-03-02 17:17:15 Ask Carl Icahn about why he dumped his steel stocks? He & Trump are buddies.
5209 2018-03-02 17:17:14 $HIP.WT  these are warrants, not stocks though. So you are paying a premium to be able to buy the stock at a later date. (Unless you just sell them without exercising)

5213 2018-03-02 17:16:57 Additionally, with the announcement of tariffs, etc. the price of many stocks have plummeted in recent weeks...allowing them to buy back stock at a much cheaper valuation. What a coinky dink!
5214 2018-03-02 17:16:54 "hey Icahn, it's the Don, I'm gonna say some shit about the tariff next week. You should sell the stocks now and when the stock market tanks, you can buy back in. Suckers!!, So much winning" - @realDonaldTrump

5218 2018-03-02 17:16:00 Martha Stewart went to prison for lying about why she sold the stocks, not the act of selling them. It was a perjury conviction.

5220 2018-03-02 17:15:48 Absolutely Pathetic - Hope you're both ok ? No excuse for such behaviour, get them before the courts. Its time justice started sending such pathetic individual down, enough is enough. Bring back the stocks - Name & shame these numpties.
5221 2018-03-02 17:15:46 @realDonaldTrump-hey Donald, where is your daily commentary on how well the stock market is doing? Good one those stupid tariffs. #tariffs #stocks
5222 2018-03-02 17:14:36 how come ichan knew to dump stocks?
5223 2018-03-02 17:14:30 Low PE, dividend and low volatility. Just look for this to survive the storm. 
Stocks like AMZN NFLX all will get a hit during the storm but will bounce back strong when it's done. So balance your portfolio and stay calm.
5224 2018-03-02 17:14:14 @Tesco Lee Mill Extra - Do you know if you have good stocks of fresh meats and vegetables to do a full weekly shop? No point travelling if the shelves are empty because of no deliveries from your suppliers.

5229 2018-03-02 17:13:23 So true. Stocks "talk" all the time. We listen to them. If it's not there, it's not there. Can't let this computer turn into a slot machine.
5230 2018-03-02 17:13:15 @MSNBC please talk about Carl Icahn tRUMP’S close confident dumping his steel stocks right before tRUMP announced putting Tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Insider trading???
5231 2018-03-02 17:12:45 Is that why your friend Ichan dumped his steel related stocks a few days ago?
5232 2018-03-02 17:12:40 "Oops! I tripped and fell on all these stocks!"
5233 2018-03-02 17:12:19 " The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters. But as part of our economic partnership, we will want to continue to work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and agree reciprocal access to waters; !! "
5234 2018-03-02 17:12:19 Hi Guys, I thought Peter Karmanos was into computers, not stocks?   Thanks, Frank
5235 2018-03-02 17:12:16 Yeah, but damn his friend just got rich dumping stocks before trumps announcement!
5236 2018-03-02 17:11:55 Hmmm. First off, 35% of US stocks owned by foreigners. Second, the top 10% of American shareholders own 84% of shares. This accelerates inequality without a doubt. Trickle up!!!!
5237 2018-03-02 17:11:50 It's amazing "How emotional and reactionary the stock market" is to words of a President or even fake news.  I invest everyone negative news is reported.I buy low,only dividend stocks reaping additional stock from my reinvestment plan.
5238 2018-03-02 17:11:30 Ichan dumps steel stocks ahead of tariff.  The corruption just keeps piling up.
5239 2018-03-02 17:11:11 Ban weapons of war,assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. Put Universal Background checks in place and then we’ll believe you. Otherwise, it’s just a lot of hot air while you grease your palms with #NRAbloodmoney
5240 2018-03-02 17:10:58 Now that Trump’s buddy Carl Ichan has made a bunch of $$$ from selling off his steel stocks, Trump will probably rescind his tariff action...
5241 2018-03-02 17:10:49 45 held a talking session about DACA said he would sign whatever congress came up with, "just do it, I will take the heat" than rejects bill, than holds meeting about gun control commits to age limits, banning bumb stocks & universal background checks, nothing done! #TrumpIsALiar
5242 2018-03-02 17:10:48 Still not enough. Perfectly healthy people can have mental breakdowns. Ban assault rifles, ban large capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, and introduce ERPO laws and have more thorough background checks. Close private sale loop holes and have a waiting period.
5243 2018-03-02 17:10:08 I am for raising age limits to 21, banning high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, wait times for gun purchases, hiring armed officers or guards, installing metal detectors, stronger background checks... Nothing about banning guns from me.
5244 2018-03-02 17:09:39 Awww buddy the stocks went down and crashed badly 
5245 2018-03-02 17:09:26 Why not a hunting rifle than? If your hunting deer why do you need an AR15? Why do you need bump stocks? Why do you need 30 round mags to kill a deer or go hunting?
5246 2018-03-02 17:09:20 #Stocks - #OOTT | ... And when you start seeing headlines on tariffs, what could be worse for the trajectory of global synchronized growth than a trade war? cc. Weeden. #WTi $DJIA $SPX $NDX $VIX #Tariffs
5247 2018-03-02 17:08:48 Boy Ted no wonder your State is Bankrupt. You left out that President has all of his assets in a blind trust by law. He is not capable of buying or selling stocks because of the blind trust. I hope the Great people of California take their State back from the illegal immigrants.
5248 2018-03-02 17:08:19 How many people close to trump dumped their stocks on company’s that use foreign steel for manufacturing. Check out the markets, inside trading?  Drop the value on cooperations so they can use the money they brought back in the country to buy back their stocks. ALL CROOKS
5249 2018-03-02 17:08:15 For those that had stocks they’ve lost their tax cut for the next three years with this Trade War...and for those without stocks they’ve lost their tax cuts in increased prices they’ll be paying for things ...nobody gets a tax cut after all...and this could turn into a recession!

5252 2018-03-02 17:07:56 Funny coincidence...
Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the tariffs will only raise the price of a car $350, that's what I got for my Trump bonus. Another coincidence, Trump's friend Carl Icahn sold his steel stocks last week.
5253 2018-03-02 17:07:55 Meanwhile...STOCKS GOING 
5254 2018-03-02 17:06:54 @realDonaldTrump has met with  NRA . how much do you want to be that he backs down on his promises about bump stocks and other #guncontrol pronouncements? How much money did they promise him?  #pathetic #flipflop #nobackbone
5255 2018-03-02 17:06:51 .@NPR stocks regained 200+ pts off AM bottom; as such, that'd not be 'continuing their slide'?? #JustSayin
5256 2018-03-02 17:06:37 Canceled my orders, I am going to stop trading for today! Over 20.000$ on the week, 80% of my trades were posted on twitter when I entered them. As @kroyrunner89 said, sometimes it’s best to take your morning profits and run! @timothysykes #trading #money #stocks
5257 2018-03-02 17:06:19 If he dumped steel stocks BEFORE announcement, he did not benefit.

5260 2018-03-02 17:04:45 How many stocks are currently in your buy list?
5261 2018-03-02 17:04:43 Same here! Looking to invest in something and I checked out Acorns and Robinhood.. I'm just scared of running into problems with those apps and my knowledge of stocks and investments is practically zero lol
5262 2018-03-02 17:04:32 Still got mine:
My tax refund? I still got!
My stocks/shares in FBM? I still got

5263 2018-03-02 17:04:11 Robert Mueller if you are listening please check who in the Trump orbit sold steel and aluminum stocks short on Wednesday.
5264 2018-03-02 17:04:09 Yes, but that's not why the market is dropping. It's all about the bond market, rising interest rates. Stock prices were artificially bumped up by unrealistically low bond rates. That time has now past. Stocks must fall to reach equilibrium.
5265 2018-03-02 17:04:06 Is #Putin a "little Rocket Man" too?  Why did your advisor dump his #steel stocks after your announcement? Why did Jared try to strong arm #Qater?
5266 2018-03-02 17:04:00 How come you never play $f or $amd $tmus $x $appl ? You like the adrenaline of volatility in low quality stocks?
5267 2018-03-02 17:03:48 Did you sell non-US steel stocks like your friend Carl Icahn did just before your announcement?  Did you buy USX? Everything you say and everything you do is a scam to enrich yourself and your friends and family.
5268 2018-03-02 17:02:55 It's not too late to diversify your portfolio to buy bonds for protection as stocks continue their volatility.
5269 2018-03-02 17:02:40 And all of the stocks jumped in the announcement, soooo he lost money?
5270 2018-03-02 17:02:39 #Trump is a businessman, and what do they do, make their surroundings more suitable for business. What a time to buy #stocks if you have the liquidity. Any connection, who knows. Bet if you follow the money where it leads may surprise you. #Bitcoin

5274 2018-03-02 17:02:10 This is such crap apparently Trump advised people to dump steel stocks several weeks ago.  His buddies got out of the companies and sold their stocks over the last several weeks.  This is corruption and insiders trading
5275 2018-03-02 17:01:52 How can we handle any threat from Putin when we can’t even get together on bump stocks, war weapons in our society and far right radicals that we elected?
5276 2018-03-02 17:01:38 @Evan_Rosenfeld dumping stock only means he acknowledges TEMP dischord vs. long term gains.  And, some arent willing to hold stocks longer. @nytimes #steel @Carl_C_Icahn
5277 2018-03-02 17:01:33 Bond market will sell off, but that money will go into equities driving the SP500 to ATH. $ mngrs are required to be invested, ultimately stocks will go to ATH. BUT it will be a stock pickers mkt vs the last 7 years of everything going up. Your TA will win

5285 2018-03-02 16:59:34 A close friend to Trump sold $30M in steel stocks a week before tariffs on steel went up? Nah, nothing to see here. Nope.
5286 2018-03-02 16:59:26 As a liberal I stand with NRA except for assault weapons and bump stocks along with backroungs checks and mental illness weapon ban. It’s not about taking anyone’s rights away it’s about fixing a problem. There IS a middle so let’s meet in the middle!
5287 2018-03-02 16:59:04 True sir... Loosing out, averaging, no stop-loss, trend stocks all are evil... Tried many times but even knowing the fact, trapped many times..
5288 2018-03-02 16:59:00 Real interesting action.  A small handful of stocks looking positive right now.  $SNAP and $TWTR are two on my radar.  Weakness in the indices.  Still holding $sqqq and will likely take some profits EOD...but a lot can happen in the next 4hrs.
5289 2018-03-02 16:58:54 Read the article, steel related stocks. Specific numbers were mentioned, which were the prices that he sold at, Then, went down to $26, how do we encourage Conservative Republicans to read? Little gold stars?  Treats? Stickers?
5290 2018-03-02 16:58:51 Which begs the question now: stocks or cash for u? And what’s driving that?

5292 2018-03-02 16:58:15 I can confirm that stocks of gin and cat food (are you serious? I wouldn't be alive) are plentiful. Cabin fever might've set in though...
5293 2018-03-02 16:58:03 Guess we have no idea how the Trump family is doing with stocks. This shit is making me sick.
5294 2018-03-02 16:57:45 Yep b/c he and his friends dumped their steel and aluminum stocks last week.
5295 2018-03-02 16:57:06 Uber stocks may go up after this announcement
5296 2018-03-02 16:56:51 Wdym trumps pushing for regulations on bump stocks and supports raising the age 21. He faked right as he was going left LOL
5297 2018-03-02 16:56:06 You and Carl Icahn will be roommates after the Mueller Indictment for insider trading (steel stocks 31.1 million) and you for   collusion with your buddy Putin.
5298 2018-03-02 16:55:54 Cheap money was fuelling stocks and turbocharging economy and creating asset bubbles which is developing risk in form of deficits and debts and smart investors will create Selloff environment

5300 2018-03-02 16:55:31 Mine too.  I see reasonably priced stocks executing, even raising dividends.  Hated. Much patience required,,,,while the Tesla's are religion
5301 2018-03-02 16:55:29 If I'm reading this correctly, my share of stocks is worth .90 cents each
5302 2018-03-02 16:54:28 ...what amazing INSTINCTS he had to dump millions of dollars of steel stocks JUST BEFORE DONNIE MADE HIS FUCKING MOUTH FART ABOUT TARIFFS. Isn’t that just a CRAZY coincidence? What REMARKABLE TIMING of Icahn! Wow. Almost, ALMOST like...he knew? Wonder what @AGSchneiderman thinks?
5303 2018-03-02 16:54:25 his is the same guy, carl icahn that dumped his stocks in the coming days before the tarriffs, suspicious

5307 2018-03-02 16:53:47 Just stop it. Bump stocks?? He never said take guns first.
5308 2018-03-02 16:53:45 @SenWarren please ask Mr Jay Clayton when and how effectively the SEC intends to investigate Mr Icahn's dumping of over $30M in steel stocks one week before his friend, the President,  called for tariffs on steel?
5309 2018-03-02 16:53:26 ...somebody will dig into this and do the math. I believe that people who do insider trades, go to jail. Just ask Martha Stewart. Hope Kushner and Trump bought steel related stocks and then sold them on Wednesday. Desperate people do desperate things.
5310 2018-03-02 16:53:16 Herma's home radio station WSB, which is really anti Trump but pretends they are for Trump, had the news story 
stating that stocks are collapsing due to Trumps comments. Stocks were down 300 points
Hardly a "collapse".

5313 2018-03-02 16:53:09 And we're all affected by this, not just your overweening sense of entitlement and resentment. How many people's retirement funds were dramatically reduced by stocks falling based on this tariff nonsense?

5317 2018-03-02 16:52:38 Gold price is going down. I don't know how far. We'll see. Now, time to buy stocks.
5318 2018-03-02 16:52:08 Seems like this would stock manipulation. Wonder if it’s criminal if DJT told people he was imposing tariffs right before they sold these stocks? Worth looking into!
5319 2018-03-02 16:52:06 Read up on TRump buddy Carl Icahn. He knew what was coming, selling off steel stocks. Made a killing. Hoping SEC investigates 
5320 2018-03-02 16:51:30 That said, initially primary metals stocks  popped on the news of more costly imports. These stocks appear to be falling back today.

5322 2018-03-02 16:51:12 Bear market was always there as there were only few stocks in tech space doing well and that too from foreign savings, sovereign wealth funds and buybacks keeping equity prices high as average investor had lost confidence due to low rates
5323 2018-03-02 16:51:07 Right now, I see a good number of stocks nearing buy points. If they fail, I will yeild, but it appears the market is firming beneath the surface.
5324 2018-03-02 16:50:55 On the conspiracy with Russia front -- did Putin need money so Trump just tanked the stock market?

Predictable market reaction, what stocks did Putin's cronies own?

I'd think this was far fetched, so I'd think the last year was & it's been real.
5325 2018-03-02 16:50:51 I am less curious on market forecasts, than what condition is a catalyst for value stocks to take over leadership position.
5326 2018-03-02 16:50:49 Perfect example of why I feel like I need to stay all cash. Even after-hours last night, commentators were saying we should buy steel stocks. No one seems to have any way to even guess where things are heading. Anyone: Perspective please!

5331 2018-03-02 16:50:00 Same here, at the small town high school I went to, most of the guys drove trucks with gun racks & a hunting rifle in the rack We had no shootings & in fact the shop teacher helped them refinish the gun stocks.

5334 2018-03-02 16:48:44 Let's be fair here, folks; it's not guns per se that we need to deal with.  It's the assault rifles, the handguns, the bump-stocks, the 20-shot clips (if you can't hit a deer with 4-5 shots you should quit hunting).
5335 2018-03-02 16:48:32 I need trump to stfu so I these stocks can start jumping again
5336 2018-03-02 16:48:16 When it ($30) breaks, which other stocks will have a piggy back ride on $WEED in your opinion?

As it’s previous unofficial status of Mutual Fund of MJ has been challenged by market and herd following in price action has diminished considerably as of late.
5337 2018-03-02 16:48:07 He is so smart! What a great business man! All on his own, with no help, he knew to sell these stocks. These are the types of men who should be leading our country.
5338 2018-03-02 16:47:55 And now it comes out his buds dumped their steel stocks 2 days before he announced the tarrifs,!
5339 2018-03-02 16:47:54 And funnily enough, he dumped millions of $ of steel related stocks just before the new tariff announcement...hmmm?
5340 2018-03-02 16:47:42 Unpopular opinion, I know (bear with me): I'm pro-gun (not Republican, not affiliated with the NRA whatsoever). 

That being said, I'd be fine with more stringent background checks inc. a full psychological profile; banning bump stocks; and maybe raising the age to 21 to buy.

5343 2018-03-02 16:47:08 @POTUS Be careful trying to appease the left.  Removing Bump stocks is a lame attempt that makes little difference.  But it gives them momentum to disarm America.  We are not giving up our 2ed Amendment rights.

5350 2018-03-02 16:45:33 @realDonaldTrump Quite a coincidence how your friend Carl Icahn, sold millions of dollars worth of steel related stocks just before your tariff announcement yesterday. In the meantime, our 401k’s are taking a dive, while you, your family & your friends are making huge profits.
5351 2018-03-02 16:45:31 Please post gun stocks site again. Need to see if  mutual funds or portfolio is invested. Thx
5352 2018-03-02 16:45:20 Of course he does. He probably dumped his steel stocks (just like Icahn), just before Trump’s announcement.
5353 2018-03-02 16:45:16 Yields up, dollar weak, gold up, stocks down. A disturbing cocktail.
5354 2018-03-02 16:45:14 They are keeping lesser stocks for pro variant which has more demand than normal note 5, so if that's the fact, ratings count for pro must be more than pro variant. But here the difference is more than 4 times, simply a intelligent game play by mi(2/2).
5355 2018-03-02 16:45:10 RT @ancientmewsic1: Yes.  It is important to honor the dead.  Please honor the dead of Parkland by passing legislation to ban all assault weapons and bump stocks.  Write it, pass it, do it. Simple. #NoMoreShootings

5361 2018-03-02 16:44:50 Stocks go up and down.

There are globalist elements of stocks, just like there are nationalist elements.

Markets sort out all the time.

5363 2018-03-02 16:44:19 An unexpected decline in German Jan retail sales also pressured European stocks. The slump in equities has fueled safe-haven demand for government debt as the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 3-week low of 2.79% and the German 10-year bund yield dropped to a 5-week low of 0.607%.
5364 2018-03-02 16:44:17 What is the best way to find stocks that are being pumped by newsletters that are good short sells?
5365 2018-03-02 16:44:08 I was just wondering when the news would break about individuals connected with the administration shorting steel-related stocks. How can they be THIS STUPID??

5367 2018-03-02 16:43:59 On #agri, @theresa_may wants divergence though looking to work with EU on managing #fisheries stocks. Most services, she's wanting reg. divergence. On digital. she says particularly important to have own UK rules. Overall lots of divergence, few hard commitments to align 3/3
5368 2018-03-02 16:43:57 at a 2-week low. Stocks are falling on concern economic growth and global trade may suffer because of the planned U.S. tariffs on foreign metal imports. European Commission President Juncker said Europe will respond "firmly" to any new duties.
5369 2018-03-02 16:43:55 Steel stocks, went up!!  Lol, you libs will believe anything, funny group.
5370 2018-03-02 16:43:53 So Trump’s friend recently dumped his stocks in the steel industry just before he threatened tariffs on imported steel . This guy is so everything , the rule of law isn’t
5371 2018-03-02 16:43:39 Two things on my mind. 1. The hurricane-force winds outside my house are freaking me out. 2. Growth stocks remain very resilient.
5372 2018-03-02 16:43:37 every mag that has widely known feeding issues whether it's the 1911 usual suspects or some GI mags, the spring was always the culprit. what is an innovative plastic? bump stocks, mags, etc are all the same common polymer. "keeping mags loaded weakens springs" is also a myth.

5375 2018-03-02 16:43:27 That's why we need a ban on bump stocks not semi-automatic rifles.
5376 2018-03-02 16:43:07 Carl - then next time vote democrat and see how they protect your gun laws. The age limit, bump stocks and background checks are not the end of the world.

5380 2018-03-02 16:41:56 Global stocks slide on concern U.S. tariffs on metal imports may start a trade war; Mar E-mini S&Ps down -0.50%; USD/JPY fall -0.76% to a 1-1/4 year low.
5381 2018-03-02 16:41:52 It doesn't personally bother me, but I can see where a person would be ticked off if they spent ~10 hours on something and didn't get a job. There are easier ways for the candidate to accomplish the same end result.

5383 2018-03-02 16:41:14 There are so many ways to legally modify the AR-15. It's one of its biggest selling points. So a ban on Bump Stocks will just have buyers switching to another alternative. The solution is not going to be simple.

5397 2018-03-02 16:39:19 @realDonaldTrump  I don't like bump stocks, I don't want one, but I DO want my rights WITHOUT infringements. You want to take guns away from people BEFORE they go to court. I know you're smart enough to understand the phrases "shall not be infringed" and
5398 2018-03-02 16:39:17 Why doesn’t anyone believe #crypto is a bubble? Most of the “coins” don’t even have a product but merely a stupid white paper. Even real companies with real products aren’t valued so high. Young crypto believers never even heard of stocks and bonds. #weird
5399 2018-03-02 16:38:49 @realDonaldTrump Your statements during this gun control flair up are unacceptable!! Our rights are NOT NEGOTIABLE!! and a REAL conservative does not cave to commies. This is not a trivial issue, this is HUGE! You want to ban "bump stocks"??
5400 2018-03-02 16:38:41 Hey Genius...nice job on the Stock Market! Of course, for some unknown reason (yeah, right) your buddy Icahn somehow dumped all his steel stocks before your announcement. Gee, I wonder how he got so lucky...

5410 2018-03-02 16:36:29 Definitely had insider information on this, how else would he know to dump his steel stocks if this is true? If so, he should go to jail and so should Trump. Mueller hurry up please!!!

5416 2018-03-02 16:35:03 So John McCain is good with an 800 billion dollar trade deficit. I can't help but wonder how many in Congress own stocks that are tied directly to these international trade deals. Broke ass lawyers enter Congress & leaving millionaires needs to be explained.

5419 2018-03-02 16:34:50 Listen to his words. They are not open to interpretation. He said he wants to raise the gun age to 21 nationally, and ban bump stocks. He spoke in plain english.
5420 2018-03-02 16:34:14 My shooting response from now on:
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list
Boycott NRA
Vote out NRA puppets

There is no coherent, or even incoherent, strategy.

Why even bother w/ an oath of office?
5423 2018-03-02 16:33:50 at least it wasnt Toby. sucks he had to give up his salary for a year after those tech stocks went through the roof because of his friends testimony.

5425 2018-03-02 16:33:33 Spot on Red Lion. It's penny stocks. It's like going to vegas and gambling at the penny slot machines. This guy JackB Wanna B a loser is full of it. 
5426 2018-03-02 16:33:26 @realDonaldTrump met behind closed doors with the NRA and got neutered. He has now backed off on all bans he was supporting with regards to assault weapons, bump stocks and age restriction.
5427 2018-03-02 16:33:22 Cabella's also sells bump stocks, or at least did when Vegas happened. Cabella's is a part of the problem.

5430 2018-03-02 16:32:48 A couple of doors up is a newish bar Beerchope which stocks every beer from Nord Pas De Calais - 200+ with a few on draught. At the top of the hill is Gandbrinus  a friendly locals bar with a good choice of Belgian beers. Many excellent restaurants in the street 2/3.
5431 2018-03-02 16:32:19 Question: which side have the Russian trolls taken in this argument? Are they #NRAMember or #BoycottNRA or both? Either way, they are laughing their bump stocks off. Hate and discontent are so easy to enflame.
5432 2018-03-02 16:32:07 I think a collapse in the bond market will drag stocks down with it, so crypto could be a beneficiary as investors look for alternatives to stocks and bonds. However, I think over the next 2-3 years, gold is very likely to explode higher, as investors run to the safe haven.
5433 2018-03-02 16:32:00 Icahn says thanks he sold all his steel stocks before you announced. Your ethics are miniscule.the Hubble telescope couldn't find them.

5437 2018-03-02 16:30:42 Seems like an issue where people who know stocks/finance realize this is very likely nothing, and people who don't will think this is probably nefarious.
5438 2018-03-02 16:30:08 And trump said in his televised meeting with law makers that he would issue a separate order banning bump stocks. Any bets that he will follow through?

5447 2018-03-02 16:29:35 Simple ban of bump stocks so semis can not be made more easily into a full automatic raising the age to 21 having all guns be treated like cars you have to pass a safety test and a mental test as well as have a license and insurance with renewal
5448 2018-03-02 16:29:25 Word on the street is, the 45 dumped his steel stocks 2 weeks ago.  He made $$$$$, conflict?
5449 2018-03-02 16:29:25 Ya, but steel stocks increased yesterday
5450 2018-03-02 16:29:23 Should be good news for stocks though, right? As money rushes out of bonds, it should move to stocks which should stabilize as soon as the higher interest rates are factored in to valuation models.
5451 2018-03-02 16:29:21 So that means no background checks, bump stocks are back, assault rifles for everyone. Then tomorrow you'll talk to someone else and change your mind again.
5452 2018-03-02 16:29:17 Capital gains realized from the sale of active investments will be excluded eg. investment in a start-up which is sold. Capital gains from selling stocks of public companies would be included as passive investment income.
5453 2018-03-02 16:28:45 It does seem like a big deal and likely is.  But I also got out of the stock market last week after hearing that Trump would announce new trade policies and tariffs in Pennsylvania on 3/9. If Icahn only sold steel stocks then he likely knew. I wouldn't be surprised at all.
5454 2018-03-02 16:28:42 I’m willing to bet the suspect will just so happen to have like 3 loose bump stocks and like 7 AR-15 all equipped with bump stocks. His iPhone has a bump stock.
5455 2018-03-02 16:28:38 @Irrational_exuberance $NFLX because fair value doesn’t always apply in this trade - especially with momentum stocks. But share your view.
5456 2018-03-02 16:28:25 @SEC_News @TheDemocrats Millions in steel stocks dumped, why is an advisor to the President dumping this stock and did Carl get insider info? Thank you
5457 2018-03-02 16:28:23 Hahahaha we laugh but it’s probably true. And then there’s the story of his “friends” dumping their stocks right before.
5458 2018-03-02 16:27:45 @PreetBharara Please take a moment to provide your thoughts on the news of Carl Icahn’s dumping of steel stocks last week in light of Trump’s announcement of tariffs. How would your office have approached this story?
5459 2018-03-02 16:27:36 @realDonaldTrump People are saying that Javanka are the real power behind the Presidency. You’re just a figure head- that makes sense. Did Jared short stocks knowing your steel announcement was coming so he could get out of debt?
5460 2018-03-02 16:27:36 And a good point was made on MSNBC ... Those who own existing large buildings would benefit from rising steel prices as new construction, the competition, would be slowed.
On the stocks.. This stunt makes Martha Stewart's minor. Insider trading by the president..OMG
5461 2018-03-02 16:27:16 still trade the same kind of setups, the same kind of stocks , and hold them for the same amount of time during this losing streak? then listen to yourself, "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."
5462 2018-03-02 16:27:07 Most people miss the first parts of a rally because they are still hanging onto the turds that are now probably under water.  While they wait for their stocks to come back and tie up capital, they miss the opportunities in the truly dynamic movers that are newly emerging.
5463 2018-03-02 16:26:53 I think he's brother right he's doing this for Hollywood but loves he's stocks going up. the world is pure Evil.
5464 2018-03-02 16:26:52 True and the NRA does good things too, but when you hear more about bump stocks and the open carrying of AKs, etc., advocation for sportsmen gets lost. They've been doing more harm than good for a long time, and when the leadership is putting out stuff like this its gone too far:
5465 2018-03-02 16:26:28 It’s not no one knows who’s getting hit with tariffs and the uk , eu, Canada , everyone is saying they won’t trade with us under these tarrifs.. watch the stocks plummet !
5466 2018-03-02 16:26:10 Smart people: "Stocks are in the toilet, dollar is devaluing, interest rates rising, Trump is adding trillions in deficit, and now he want tariffs which NEVER historically work and only harm our economy."

Trumpanzees: "W-w-w-well he's playing 4D Chess...!"
5467 2018-03-02 16:25:53 When the mkt corrects, the stocks that are the first to vault through bases to new highs on robust volume are normally your mkt leaders, those capable of moving the fastest. Keep your eyes on stocks within 10-15% of their previous highs and close to base breakouts.
5468 2018-03-02 16:25:42 How did that help him? Steel stocks went higher this week.
5469 2018-03-02 16:25:42 .0002/3 stocks are HOT, $GFOX .0003 next??
5470 2018-03-02 16:25:34 Yes it's a bull market thanks to President Trump. Stocks and 401 k plans keep going up.paychecks bigger for most. Social security checks bigger. Plenty of jobs!
5471 2018-03-02 16:25:32 Crusty .... I'm sure U got High Blood Pressure ... soothe yourself with good deals on stocks.  Amazon's also down. Pricey for sure but tempting to buy a few more at these levels, don't u think?
5472 2018-03-02 16:25:22 This isn’t about bump stocks but about mega international corporations usurping the power of individuals & their elected  representatives to impose Progressive tyranny.
5473 2018-03-02 16:25:04 There are a lot more like this.  See when people say assault rifle they think AR 15.  That is a semi automatic.  What constitutes Assault rifle?  Everything that isn't bolt action is semi automatic.  Now if you want to ban bump stocks etc that would be a lot easier.
5474 2018-03-02 16:24:42 No- but Carl Icahn dumped his Steel stocks last week. @sec should be checking that!
5475 2018-03-02 16:24:29 Well, steel stocks went up in the wake of the announcement so...
5476 2018-03-02 16:24:27 What happened to your bold statements about universal background checks and no bump stocks? Did the NRA threaten to withdraw their HUGE donations if you didn’t change your tune? 
At least we now know (if there was ever any?), that you care more about $$ than #StandwiththeKids SAD
5477 2018-03-02 16:24:22 Don't take your eye off the ball.  The mkt is piling up distribution right now and things look bleak, but this is just an opportunity to let the mkt separate the wheat from the chaff.  The strong stocks will start sticking out like a sore thumb and be hanging out near buy points.
5478 2018-03-02 16:24:15 Carl Icahn dumping steel stocks just days ago sounds like the definition of insider trading to me!
5479 2018-03-02 16:23:55 How much you want to bet other DT friends and/or family either sold steel and aluminum related stocks or shorted the market in days leading up the the tariff announcement?
5480 2018-03-02 16:23:45 L'argent n'est pas tabou mais cela n'est pas une référence non plus, surtout dans le milieu hospitalier, maitrise des couts du matériel : les tenus sont usés, les stocks plus disponibles, maîtrise de la masse salariale : sous effectif, plus d'erreurs médicales et j'en passe.

5482 2018-03-02 16:23:02 Don't worry everyone, Trump advisor Carl Icahn got out of steel stocks just before the tariff announcement.  I know we were all worried that tariffs might hurt billionaires.

5484 2018-03-02 16:22:43 I would be snapping up some cheap stocks if $COF investing website was working.
5485 2018-03-02 16:22:30 If one owns few mutual stocks, such (in)direct connections can be made all day long.
5486 2018-03-02 16:22:04 How much you want to bet other DT friends and/or family either sold steel and aluminum related stocks or shorted the market in days leading up the the tariff announcement?
5487 2018-03-02 16:21:57 adam not following azn sorry. Just sticking with 5 main stocks $srpt $clvs $fgen $espr $gbt and small caps
5488 2018-03-02 16:21:38 He put a tariff on Canadian steel. We’re your friendliest trade partner and one of your biggest. Because of this, your stocks dropped AGAIN.
5489 2018-03-02 16:21:34 We could put Gary Smith and Donalda McKinnon in the stocks and throw tumshies at them. Otherwise known as @BBCScotlandNews staff.
5490 2018-03-02 16:21:33 His friends are getting rich dumping steel stocks.
5491 2018-03-02 16:21:24 My Bloomberg news headlines: "Warren Buffett loses 3.7 Billion this week after US stocks tumbled..." My thoughts: "man Warren Buffett loses more than my combined salary just taking a dump..."
5492 2018-03-02 16:21:08 We have the #tech to produce #steel & #aluminum cheaply.Best part, massive deposits on public land + recycling.Win for everyone#Stocks
5493 2018-03-02 16:20:44 "Carl Icahn"dumping steel related stocks......perhaps inside the White House information?..........maybe another Trump scandal that needs to be investigated?
5494 2018-03-02 16:20:31 In case you forgot how irrational the stock market is: stocks tank on news that the US is adopting Chinese-style trade practices. Think about that.
5495 2018-03-02 16:20:31 when i use simulator to buys stocks i got profit when i use real money the stock simple get down

5498 2018-03-02 16:20:00 please dont just flap gums...steel stocks went up nicely on the news...
5499 2018-03-02 16:19:58 We’re just like Warren Buffett. But instead of investing in value stocks we lose money on crypto, and instead of writing annual letters we write daily tweets. We’re nothing like Warren Buffett.
5500 2018-03-02 16:19:42 Enjoy, btw worldwide stocks are plunging. Tomtom is a bargain to buy now, good luck :)
5501 2018-03-02 16:19:22 I was gonna reply that steel stocks actually exploded up, but then read the article and realized he dumped the ones that depend on getting steel, which naturally got destroyed yesterday. That makes more sense.
5502 2018-03-02 16:19:22 if LYiNG #GOPe REALLY wanted to "Bring #JOBS BACK to USA" instead of JUST PASS OUT #CorporateWelfare to Multi-National Corps they would PASS a #BorderAdjustmentTax == it would FORCE Multi-National Corps to BRING #Jobs Back to USA to AVOID IT ... instead of JUST BUY BACK STOCKS
5503 2018-03-02 16:19:20 So he missed out on the big pop in steel stocks.
5504 2018-03-02 16:19:18 @JamesGRickards what stocks should we buy if any? Other than gold.
5505 2018-03-02 16:19:16 Notice swamp just drained.
Trump announces stocks plummet.
He will buy once stock hits bottom.
Then Trump will revoke decision and he will re-buy stock at low point.
Then Trump will repeat.
Splitting difference in offshore accounts.
5506 2018-03-02 16:19:07 @realDonaldTrump It is more important to safeguard lives of school children than protect semi auto & automatic weapon holders Ban automatic weapon purchases, bump stocks & create complete background checks for all gun purchases now No need 4 auto guns - hunting & target shooting
5507 2018-03-02 16:19:01 He sold the stock of a crane company?
This is your smoking gun?

The SEC takes a real dim view of insider trading. Icahn & his broker are screwed. If he sold stocks in big enough lots to go across the big board, he's in more trouble. Icahn, of all people, knows better.

5511 2018-03-02 16:18:55 Hey @SEC_Enforcement
 and 
@NewYorkFBI 

I think you need to take a good hard look at Trumps buddy Mr. Carl Icahn who dumped $31.3 million in steel related stocks days before Trump announced his tariffs.  

This MUST STOP!

5512 2018-03-02 16:18:37 i wonder if treasuries tank if stocks dont
maybe we need stocks to crater for a better tomorrow
5513 2018-03-02 16:18:32 “The offense leveled against Martha Stewart was one of "insider trading,” wherein an individual buys or sells stocks by using non-public information given to them by the people of a company. Insider trading is not legal and is considered a serious offense.”
5514 2018-03-02 16:18:21 My shooting response from now on:
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips

“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list

5516 2018-03-02 16:18:01 @Carl_C_Icahn I have demanded that my U.S. Senators and Congressional representative begin investigations into Mr. Icahn's insider trading. You, Mr. Icahn, appear to have broken some very serious laws by dumping your steel stocks based on knowledge of the tariffs. #Jail
5517 2018-03-02 16:17:56 one of his advisors dumped the steel stocks he held right before this.  he made  a lot on short selling, and if trump back pedals? he can re purchase at a discount...
its all based on insider trading and crony capitalism
5518 2018-03-02 16:17:45 Martha Stewart went to jail for insider trading & our family lost everything in stocks that year. We had that stock. I’m seeing a double standard here.
5519 2018-03-02 16:17:40 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list.
5520 2018-03-02 16:17:33 @realDonaldTrump 

Did you tell Icahn and all your buddies about your ill advised tariff statement yesterday Donny.

Icahn invests in steel stocks, mmm.

Insider info Donny?

Maybe the SEC should have a look.

You’re in DIP SHIT!
5521 2018-03-02 16:17:24 Are capital gains from the sale of stocks included in “passive income”?

5530 2018-03-02 16:16:32 Carl Icahn sold stocks he held in aluminum and steel. Hmmmmmm
5531 2018-03-02 16:16:28 What is the purpose of the bump stocks?
5532 2018-03-02 16:16:07 ANET still one of the strongest stocks. added to my position on the dip
5533 2018-03-02 16:15:58 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
5534 2018-03-02 16:15:56 You did not get the tip from Carl Ichan to buy US Steel stocks ? I guess your not one of @realDonaldTrump insider trading buddies. Millions $$$ were made by Trump Buddies just by him saying what he was told to say. #Imp
5535 2018-03-02 16:15:47 Meantime, the stocks in basically everyone who makes stuff out of steel or aluminum dropped a few percent yesterday after the tariff announcement and are continuing to fall today. It's not because the tariffs took effect, it's because the market hates the announcement.
5536 2018-03-02 16:15:46 Annoying. Value getting hit harder than the stupid stocks.
5537 2018-03-02 16:15:34 Something tells me this might be the last red day on the market a lot of stocks I thought would be tanking are actually green. $GE smh!!!!!!!!!!
5538 2018-03-02 16:15:32 Carl Icahn sold 31 mil in steel company stocks last week. Wow.  That's great timing
5539 2018-03-02 16:15:18 @buffaloroad22 Breaking News? Did Carl Icahn sell off his steel stocks b4 announcement of trade war?Reminder he is a senior advisor 2dt. Wilbur Ross missed point on CNBC. Costs passed on to consumers-US The merger crumbs 2018 tax cut will vanish. This is inflationary & dangerous!
5540 2018-03-02 16:15:15 His buddy Carl Icahn dumped millions in steel related stocks right before the announcement - I'm sure it was just another coincidence...
5541 2018-03-02 16:15:11 Coincidence that certain individuals are dumping steel stocks before the tariff announcement. Hmm
5542 2018-03-02 16:15:06 Inside The Market: Among sector-style #ETFs, $XLV and $IBB were up, representing #healthcare and #biotech.

5548 2018-03-02 16:14:38 Knowing that dt is all about making money 4 himself & his sick disgusting family at the expense of humans someone should look into sales of stocks, especially steel related ones by him or his concerns just before he announced his ridiculous business killing tariffs. FOLLOW THE $
5549 2018-03-02 16:14:12 Carl Icahn dumped millions in STEEL RELATED stocks last week, days before tariff announcement, if Trump told Icahn this would be insider trading and a very big problem of sharing secrets with friends for profit. INSIDER TRADING CARL ICAHN? Impeccable timing says MSNBC. Unverified
5550 2018-03-02 16:14:01 One his major supporters, Carl Icahn, dumped steel stocks 2 weeks ago ahead of the anouncement. You are correct.

5556 2018-03-02 16:13:20 When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on economic decline with virtually every tweet its @POTUS does, trade wars are bad, and easy to lose. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain @POTUS and he tweets, stocks dive-we lose big. It’s easy!
5557 2018-03-02 16:13:11 Trump is using our WH as his personal enterprise. When his confidant unloads $M's in steel stocks days before the Dom puts tariffs in place.

5561 2018-03-02 16:13:01 Do not expand your horizon going in stocks that are clearly front loaded on a Friday, today's close could be atrocious especially if Cohn resigns around 3-4. The fact that he wasnt parading on TV this morning about Tariffs is a big clue imo and Krudlow begging
5562 2018-03-02 16:12:52 je mnoho jiných věcí, které stojí za to diskutovat a které jsou skutečnými náklady intervenčního režimu ... a taky podle mně exit ještě stále úplně neproběhl, takže bych s hodnocením počkal :)
5563 2018-03-02 16:12:50 Apparently his pals were dumping steel stocks last week too
5564 2018-03-02 16:12:38 Oh you think it’s better to bring unwanted children into this world to live miserable lives and you support assault rifle and bump stocks you’re pathetic
5565 2018-03-02 16:12:34 It is most certainly why the market is down. No one thinks the tariffs will directl hurt the economy. Investors fear that countries will retaliate (which they will) spiralling us into a trade war. $368 billion was wiped out in largecap stocks while steel climbed 2.7 billion.
5566 2018-03-02 16:12:30 But his friend Carl Icahn made a ton of money by selling his steel stocks prior to yesterday's tweet.  Kleptocracy at its finest.  Don't care anymore if the US people know they are robbing us.
5567 2018-03-02 16:12:21 But his friends were psychic and able to sell affected stocks before this news became public... interesting.
5568 2018-03-02 16:12:18 Did you guys play with bump stocks
5569 2018-03-02 16:12:13 If specific stock prices were mentioned, stocks were sold at $32-$34 a share, and then tank to $26 a share, you are looking at a specific stock or fund.  He sold big, right before it tanked.
5570 2018-03-02 16:12:05 Wow! Who would have guessed Carl Icahn may have dumped steel related stocks last week. Who’s on his speed dial? I wonder who that could be.  And Wilbur Ross is an asshole that will do everything to increase my food bills and costs of shit I buy.  Not to mention tank my stocks.
5571 2018-03-02 16:12:02 Five bucks says the SEC won't bat an eyelash at Carl Icahn dumping his steel-related stocks last week in advance of the tariffs.
5572 2018-03-02 16:11:43 Well the NRA has stated they support a ban on bump stocks along with stricter background checks right?  If he backtracked, its effectively in line
5573 2018-03-02 16:11:31 Just reported that Carl Icahn, Trump’s long time confidant dumped steel stocks last week, curiously just ahead of Trump’s tariff announcement. WTF?! These people simply do not believe that any of the laws, rules, or consequences apply to any of them.
5574 2018-03-02 16:11:31 He screwed up. Steel stocks went up.
5575 2018-03-02 16:11:30 to není o tom, že bych slepě hájil intervenční politiku ČNB ... jenom podle mého názoru nejsou kurzové ztráty vzniklé z posilování CZK tím správným argumentem pro kritiku ... to je skutečně jenom zrcadlová pozice stavu bohatství české ekonomiky
5576 2018-03-02 16:11:16 Rumors in Media (#MSNBC) that Trump adviser billionaire Carl #Icahn dumped large amounts of steel-related company stocks last week, just before the president announced his intention to raise steel tariffs.......

5579 2018-03-02 16:10:40 Instead of taking all guns, I think regulated stocks for certain guns that let you rain down on people should be illegal to an extent. Like Canada did
5580 2018-03-02 16:10:36 You're supposed to protect our rights and oppose gun control (and that includes bump-stocks). Have you guys at NRA HQ lost your mind?
5581 2018-03-02 16:10:27 Think he was shorting steel stocks at the same time?
5582 2018-03-02 16:10:26 ... the costs of domestic production will be higher (or else the goods will have been been made here originally) and 2) retaliation by other nations will drive down exports, possibly creating new trade deficits (Boeing stocks off 10%.)

5588 2018-03-02 16:09:18 @SRuhle Interesting info on Icahn n the selling off of stocks last week. Insider info? Will Icahn get away w/the obvious while others go to prison for the same?
5589 2018-03-02 16:09:16 Not true. Stocks and 401 k plans didn't start going up till after President Trump got in office. As checks 19.00 increase. First time in 8 years. Pay checks bigger thanks to tax cuts. Unemployment closest in 20 yrs. Plenty of jobs even for minorities. Thanks to President Trump
5590 2018-03-02 16:09:12 That was stupid. Metal stocks are the only stocks that did well since the announcement!
5591 2018-03-02 16:09:05 How about possible insider trading?  Just how did Carl Icahn know to dump millions in stocks right before Trump said he was going to do tariffs on steel?  Suspicious
5592 2018-03-02 16:08:58 Carl Icahn dumped huge amounts of steel stocks prior to 45 announcement of tariffs on imported steel. Steel stocks tanked. Market down almost 1000 points since yesterday. Our allies especially Canada, will be hurt. Putin.
5593 2018-03-02 16:08:51 Holy crap! Did tRump tell Icahn about his plan??? It’s #mueller time for this. This stinks. Wonder who else dumped steel and aluminum stocks before announcement?
5594 2018-03-02 16:08:40 why would he do that when steel stocks skyrocketed!
5595 2018-03-02 16:08:35 Wilbur Ross brings props. Classic passive aggressive way of telling us we're acting like school children. He even threw in a stock recommendation. $GM @CNBC #stocks #steel #Commodities

5606 2018-03-02 16:07:18 @CNN  why don't you look into whether or not Trump's recent conversations with his friends and cronies who happen to own stocks that might be shorted or manipulated by such a revelation as tariffs with no lead up simply a blurting out
#insider trading
5607 2018-03-02 16:07:11 @SEC_News What are you going to do about Carl Ichan's impeccable timing on selling steel stocks?
5608 2018-03-02 16:07:07 If he sold at $32-$34, and it’s down to $26 now, it doesn’t take an economist to recognize insider trading, in this case.  Trump imposed tariffs, stocks dropped, the guy made money. It’s not a difficult concept to understand.
5609 2018-03-02 16:07:06 WHY WOULD YOU WISH TO BUY A TICKET FOR EITHER OF THEM........YOU SHOULD BE PUT IN THE STOCKS FOR DOING SO
5610 2018-03-02 16:06:43 Can @realDonaldTrump please stop making my stocks completely tank?
5611 2018-03-02 16:06:32 Carl Icahn dump his stocks requiring steel for manufacturing.
5612 2018-03-02 16:06:29 Charlie, any idea how much of the S&P 500's earnings are from the stocks in the tech sector? Am wondering if the sector is really too big, or if it's weighting accurately reflects tech's contribution to the index's profits.
5613 2018-03-02 16:06:15 Thanks to Trumps tariff, stocks are low and my portfolio is in the red.  no big deal...
5614 2018-03-02 16:06:06 Is Trump's steel and aluminum tariff tanking the stock market done so Trump and his 1% billionaires can buy stocks low and sell high?
Then Trump - just throwing out a thought IMHO that maybe could happen? - doesn't go through with the tariffs?
5615 2018-03-02 16:05:58 You're in it now, bro! Let it ride and have a backbone with the shareholders. Tell them why their stocks will drop significantly for the sake of political correctness. They'll love you for it.
5616 2018-03-02 16:05:52 Why are you fucking the stock market? Every time you say something my stocks seem to dip down and that was the only benefit I saw in you being President, the market going up
5617 2018-03-02 16:05:45 ano, nenutil, na druhé straně znalost přibližného datumu umožnila české korporátní sféře se zajistit vůči posílení CZK .... nikdo z nás neví, jak volatilní by bylo obchodování s CZK v případě překvapivého exitu a-la CHF ...
5618 2018-03-02 16:05:35 This story beat me to the point. Would be curious if any of Trumps family and/or friends sold their steel relates stocks or shorted the market recently?
5619 2018-03-02 16:05:34 Better question: Did he short sell any stocks based on this info?
5620 2018-03-02 16:05:31 Humana plans to return 50% of tax reform benefit to shareholders. Most of which will go to the richest 10% of American households since they own 84% of stocks (as of 2016).
5621 2018-03-02 16:05:24 yeah; shows smart friends of Trump were totally unaware of what he did yesterday; time to sell steel stocks was yesterday after announcement, not last week @JuddLegum

Cause that’s wht he’s looking at.
5625 2018-03-02 16:05:02 @realDonaldTrump Stocks down for fourth day straight. Time for Kelly to cut off your fingers. This is probably the ONE time you are responsible for the market. "Trade wars are easy." Jesus, boy, what drugs are you taking? #TrumpCantEconomics
5626 2018-03-02 16:04:58 Went to cash last night. Love these stocks but not the market. Probably need a few waves down and undercuts of support before it can rally after such a long sustained rally. I think even the shoe shine boy and haircutters had stock tips for me in December.

5630 2018-03-02 16:04:10 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

5633 2018-03-02 16:03:31 Wonder if Jared and co shorted any stocks coincidentally to cover the fees for his 666 building...
5634 2018-03-02 16:03:21 It simulates automatic. It's not true automatic. Ban those. I don't care about those. But this thread is not being honest. It's not talking about bump stocks. It's making people think the civ ar-15 is an assault rifle. It's not.
5635 2018-03-02 16:03:03 Anyone wanna guess how many on Team Trump are making bank by shorting stocks right now with a little insider trading off the tariff news? #CorruptTrump
5636 2018-03-02 16:02:47 Gun retail dealers are doing more then Trumps bullshit rhetoric. Wish he'd stop with the verbal bravado and do something ?He claimed he wanted better background checks for gun sales,also going to ban bump stocks? Anything of what he says being accomplished? Words mean nothing.
5637 2018-03-02 16:02:36 Steel stocks actually rose. It was rest of market that tanked. And wait til our wheat, soybean and corn farmers get blown up by this.
5638 2018-03-02 16:02:35 Their response. “ L.L.Bean does not and never has supported the NRA. We also do not sell assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, semi-automatic firearms, hand guns or bump stocks. “
5639 2018-03-02 16:02:28 @whatjinx 100% wrong. The stocks were for companies that buy steel, and steel prices will now go up
5640 2018-03-02 16:02:24 Be careful the weapon you use to hunt down Polk. Bump stocks are getting a lot of scrutiny these days.

5642 2018-03-02 16:01:42 The world is digesting the regressive policies of the Trunp administration. Stocks sharply lower on the week as some of the positive mojo is gone. PE ratio compression to better value America lead by an idiot.
5643 2018-03-02 16:01:25 As per L.L Bean,

5645 2018-03-02 16:01:12 Carl Icahn, dumped steel stocks just prior to tariffs? Bha, ha, ha, that's just a little insidery (making up words again) but I'm facinated, Prince talked about Aluminum in secret meetings, Deripaska owns bauxite ore rights En+group, of whom Manafort owes millions, weird no?
5646 2018-03-02 16:01:11 ČNB nikdo nenutil otevřeně stanovovat pevné datum, do kdy budou intervenovat. Tím se z toho stala sázka na jistotu. Ještě v listopadu 2016 drželi nerezidentní 30 % korunových dluhopisů, v dubnu to bylo už 45 %. Objem spekulativních pozic mohl být nižší.

5652 2018-03-02 15:59:36 Point taken on bump stocks.

I’m not sure how to handle existing AR-15s if they are banned. Banning new sales is probably easy. Perhaps ban used sales and/or introduce a buyback program?

I don’t pretend to claim an AR-15 ban would be easy to implement.

5659 2018-03-02 15:57:45 Yes! Dumped 31 million in stocks. Sure he talked to his buddy in the orange house before doing so.

5661 2018-03-02 15:57:21 yeah but they sell high and when the news came and stocks plummet short term, they capitalise n buy those same stocks at a cheaper price. for those with millions in stock options those little percentages are big time money

5665 2018-03-02 15:57:10 Sensible gun laws means background checks and banning bump stocks. I don't support gun confiscation without reason, like a conviction of a violent crime. There should be a process to judge wether the person in question isn't fit to have a gun, and to get the gun back if needed.
5666 2018-03-02 15:56:46 Hmm stocks of my blood type are low if only the rules didn’t forbid me from donating my nasty gay blood
5667 2018-03-02 15:56:43 #DonTheCon sharing inside information with his #RichBro Carl Icahn about his upcoming stupid tariff so that Icahn can quickly dump his stocks before negative stock market effect. It is just so blatant! #ImpeachTrumpNow
5668 2018-03-02 15:56:22 This is a distraction from global stocks which plummeted today.
5669 2018-03-02 15:55:43 @waltshaub Did I read today in Twitter that Carl Ichan dumped steel stocks just ahead of Trump's surprise announcement? Is insider trading now acceptable in this cesspool of a WH?

5671 2018-03-02 15:55:41 Trump Family speculated on falling stocks. @realDonaldTrump made it real with his announcement of trade war. #ResistTrump
5672 2018-03-02 15:55:06 Actually a bump stock does not make it “fully automatic.” It merely allows one to pull the trigger quicker. I have no problem getting rid of bump stocks but they can be created by ingenuous people. AR 15 bans are impractical unless you want to introduce gun confiscation.
5673 2018-03-02 15:54:23 Just as guys who "pump and dump" are 2 b  avoided.. equally dangerous r those who give sell calls and the stocks go way up

Maybe the sell calls r purposely initiated so that they can buy illiquid stocks at lower rates in the ensuing fall

They shd be labelled as "dump and pump".
5674 2018-03-02 15:54:18 Geat question and one I believe no one answer exists. As it relates to this one case I don't believe enough facts are out so I won't comment on this. I believe Trump is taking great strides. Bump stocks, a sort of gun register, more power to officials regarding mental helath.

5723 2018-03-02 15:42:34 but Trump is signaling support for the teachers with guns thing, not for allowing bump stocks. partisans take cues from their party leadership.

5731 2018-03-02 15:41:19 @larry_kudlow Icahn dumps steel stocks prior to announcement. SEC laughs. Most corrupt admn in history. Kudlow fails to speak out

5734 2018-03-02 15:40:40 Unfortunately banning bump stocks is a smokescreen, not even a baby step. All Semi-Automatic weapons can easily be bump fired without a bump stock. The bump Stock is just a bragging rites accessory to make the weapon look cool.
5735 2018-03-02 15:40:35 How did I not short gun stocks after his last shooting..

5737 2018-03-02 15:39:18 S&P 500 closed Wednesday at 2,714. Posting a decline of 2.6% for February, on a total-return basis. The first monthly decline in U.S. stocks since October '16, and the end of the longest-ever monthly win streak. The previous record was a 10-month streak that ended September '95.
5738 2018-03-02 15:38:52 The swamp is so deep I’d be buying stocks in eggs,let’s keep cracking
5739 2018-03-02 15:38:24 @davidfaber When you have billions pennies are nothing. When you have nothing pennies add up. You should have asked him if he owns steel stocks.
5740 2018-03-02 15:37:36 Consolidate accounts to a single banking provider, let everyone else lose business. Rinse repeat for top 2%, banking stocks will tumble.
5741 2018-03-02 15:37:31 Trump today: 'trade wars are good.' Worldwide stocks crash, friends and enemies retaliate with tariffs on farm goods etc., CPI and inflation rise, beer more expensive. Trump: 'who knew trade could be so complicated.'
5742 2018-03-02 15:37:12 You've fought against banning bump stocks, against universal background checks, against age restrictions, against CDC monitoring and research, against closing the gun show loophole, against every single sane measure.
STFU, the kids are talking.
5743 2018-03-02 15:36:13 You can pay from 50,000 to 100,000 in taxes as if you move to the business owner side and investor side you just pay 20% tax like me  whenever I make a profit on penny stocks I just have to pay 20% of it in tax at the end of the year. It’s quite astonishing but it is how it is
5744 2018-03-02 15:35:44 Easy like watching the stock market decline? #stocks
5745 2018-03-02 15:35:35 Anyone else thinking about shorting US steel stocks?
5746 2018-03-02 15:35:19 I’m starting to wonder if the Uber rich are getting richer on these outlandish tariff moves, etc. A little heads up on stocks plummeting can line pockets.
5747 2018-03-02 15:35:14 Replying to @realDonaldTrump,believe I will "wait & see" until contract signed,by Boeing!

If you had such a good meeting with NRA,why not share? Can you tell me if they Banned Assult Rifles & Bump Stocks,no use for these to general population. Yes to Law Enforcement & Military
5748 2018-03-02 15:35:12 Stocks drop sharply at the open on trade war fears
5749 2018-03-02 15:35:05 My 401k will be six figures soon my stocks will be worth 5 figures soon Imma get that bag and put something in mama purse
5750 2018-03-02 15:35:01 Im not a TA person so maybe I shouldn't say, but after trading in vol and stocks my exp is no. I think it's logical - ppl buy stocks after a drop bc it's cheap, vol is just a reflection of sentiment which doesn't always go down just bc it went up etc
5751 2018-03-02 15:34:50 So much for the $2000 in tax savings that US family of 4 got from the #TaxReform Bill. Your IRA, 401K and stocks are tanking right now. Oh, and you're going to pay more for ANYTHING made with metal. Winning! #TradeWar #Tariffs #DowJones
5752 2018-03-02 15:34:44 @maddow @allinwithchris @HardballChris I’m sure you have thought of this, but how do we know Trump isn’t shorting stocks while he makes the market drop?

5755 2018-03-02 15:34:12 I’d hope that God will forgive you attacking these kids because I goddam well don’t. This is emotional child abuse and you should be locked in stocks and publicly shamed.
5756 2018-03-02 15:33:47 "M16 on semi-auto" is a tacit admission that there is an automatic function for the same weapon. The AR-15 has no such function. That's a big difference. 

(if you want to talk about bump-stocks, you'll be preaching to the choir, they ought to be banned).
5757 2018-03-02 15:33:30 Crazy isn’t it but that’s the nature of pharma stocks they can drift to ridiculously low levels then rise to ridiculously high levels when trial results are either out or due. IMM a good example of that £20m mcap to £200m mcap as results drew closer #EVG

5760 2018-03-02 15:32:42 So now that you have quite building with steel from overseas you can hypothetically start charging a tariff for it. So did all your friends make a bundle yesterday when the stocks dropped like crazy?

US Stocks Plunge on `Trade War' Talk
5762 2018-03-02 15:32:07 Lets not  forget the millions of dollars he wiped off stocks with his 'easy peasy lemon squeezy' comments about ptotectionism
5763 2018-03-02 15:31:35 But a large chunk of Trump supporters want some of those gun restrictions, so they aren’t just completely polling on partisan lines. They think it’s a good idea. Many more than having bump stocks. Even though teachers with guns would result any many more dead than those others.
5764 2018-03-02 15:31:21 Step 1: Buy stocks in steel and alluminium. 
Step 2: Raise import taxes on steel and alluminium.
Step3: Sell stocks for big profits and screw everyone. Frack the US economy. I get richer.

adding people with mental illnesses to the federal gun background check system (92 percent),
raising the legal age to purchase guns from 18 to 21 (82 percent),
banning bump stocks (81 percent),
5778 2018-03-02 15:26:32 OK, let's see. In the short-term, US stocks have lost $1.5 TRILLION in value. BTW, this won't end with tariffs. Our trading partners will retaliate. Everybody loses, including Trump.
5779 2018-03-02 15:26:18 Baby steps. Still nothing on universal background checks or even bump stocks. Hesitant on high capacity magazines because self-defense? And of course, no mention of banning assault rifles. #BanAssaultRifles #NeverAgain

5781 2018-03-02 15:25:56 You should have shorted the stocks.

5785 2018-03-02 15:24:54 Feb 7, 2018 - President Donald Trump has some advice for investors: they're making a “big mistake” by selling off stocks amid good economic news. “In the 'old days,' when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market
5786 2018-03-02 15:24:52 Are you at least for universal background checks, ending bump stocks, and ending loopholes? 

Are you for at least one of these things I mentioned?
5787 2018-03-02 15:24:49 Naw man if that happened the world we know would be burning right now. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a calculated value based on a bunch of key indicator stocks that tries to roughly approximate the stock market’s general trends - it dropped by around $400 yesterday.

Has he really had a stance that the NRA won’t give a darn about?  He is all talk and changes his mind as soon as it conflicts the NRA.
5803 2018-03-02 15:22:00 Not what I said.
Stocks tanking is the rate hikes, not the tariffs.

Big businesses with Obama era debt accumulated at 0% can't afford to refinance into rising interest rates.

They're thinking tank the market, rate hikes get cancelled.

5812 2018-03-02 15:18:41 ...So true, and so frustrating for you, I'm sure. I'd been told for decade that the market hated uncertainty, and I share your wonderment that stocks surged so much under such an unpredictable administration.
5813 2018-03-02 15:18:35 the stock market's time horizon is in quarters.  Trade is a long game. Stocks may drop prices may/will rise, but continuing to nurse a stock market and preserve low prices for cheap Chinese crap is just a slow, comfy way to die.
5814 2018-03-02 15:18:34 If you are primarily invested in foreign stocks you will take a hit, if you are primarily invested in American stocks Potus will continue to make you look like an investment genius. Stock market always gets nervous about bold moves on the frontside.

5821 2018-03-02 15:17:23 If you want a federal background check on all person to person sales, I am 1000% against that as it mandates the formation and maintenance of a federal gun registry.

5827 2018-03-02 15:15:41 Moved my portfolio to non-US stocks soon after Trump was elected. That Trump would trash the economy was a given, but I am surprised it only took 14 months.
5828 2018-03-02 15:15:08 why don't investment advisors put customers 100% in stocks over a 20+ year period? Because fear clients will fire advisor after -20% and advisors likes getting paid. so advisors and clients utilize a lower expected payout plan to keep game going.

5857 2018-03-02 15:08:56 Bump stocks?
5858 2018-03-02 15:08:32 Hey Donny Boy - it would seem that stock investors don’t share your #pathetic “argument” regarding your #stupid metals tariffs. Stocks down 300 this morning! @realDonaldTrump #NotFitToBePOTUS
5859 2018-03-02 15:08:19 Pavle, jenže tady Martin nemá pravdu ... můžeme se bavit o tom, jestli ztráta nemohla být menší, ale pokud má ČNB ztrátu z posilování CZK, tak na tom vydělávají všichni obyvatelé ČR ... navíc naše aktiva/cash-flow jsou mnohem větší než devizové rezervy ČNB nebo pozice spekulantů
5860 2018-03-02 15:07:56 Although I am worried about these tariffs, I wonder if  the criticism by all the pundits is really more political than economic. Steel is a very tiny percentage of our GDP and is not likely to stall the economy. Might be buying opportunity for stocks.
5861 2018-03-02 15:07:22 It is time to fix this problem.  The people demand it.  Bump stocks, high capacity magazines, assault weapons.  58 dead in Vegas - how would your plans stop that? #NeverAgain

5865 2018-03-02 15:06:29 @jimcramer is making sense today about the steel tariffs.  If this tactic works, and China lowers its tariffs on our goods, the market will explode to the upside. I have my stocks and target pricing in place.
5866 2018-03-02 15:06:21 Good day to add stocks to your watchlist.
5867 2018-03-02 15:06:00 Well at least y'all about to get a break from me talking about stocks all the time I think this correction is going to last all of march
5868 2018-03-02 15:05:56 Today I've invested $1300 in Electronic Arts, $1000 in Google (Alphabet), and $600 in Twitter. This is the first time I'm buying US stocks. This is what I'll do next 3 years. Just love products of this companies. I'm a big Dragon Age fan for example.
5869 2018-03-02 15:05:53 People who take the last of the coffee without getting a new pot brewing should be put in the stocks.
5870 2018-03-02 15:05:49 that's a shocker, followed by all the retail, auto and manufacturing stocks next week after china retaliates
5871 2018-03-02 15:05:48 Stocks drop 500 points... It's as if people don't think you know what you're talking about
5872 2018-03-02 15:05:26 Trump Tariffs Roil Stocks is a fun headline but the stock market moves randomly and except for a few companies there isn't a clear effect. Also the stock market going down isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing.
5873 2018-03-02 15:05:04 I concur. You have to pull the trigger each time you want a round to fire.  The hysteria over "bump stocks" is totally misplaced for this reason.
5874 2018-03-02 15:04:18 Fun fact: that’s why I support an assault weapons ban, raising gun ownership age, banning bump stocks, closing background check loopholes, and a host of other measures. 

Another fun fact: check out someone’s timeline before treating everyone like an NRA psycho.
5875 2018-03-02 15:03:55 And stocks are down 300... Thanks idiot.
5876 2018-03-02 15:03:53 TM offering a cherry? “But as part of our economic partnership we will want to continue to work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry.”

5878 2018-03-02 15:03:11 Stocks down 300... Why thank you Trump!

5880 2018-03-02 15:02:39 @ReformedBroker Never forget when you said put in limit buys way under where stocks are currently trading. If they hit great, not oh well. Worked real well during the last crazy drop. Doing it again in this environment. See what happens. Thanks!
5881 2018-03-02 15:02:24 That's the aggregate story, but at an individual level could be much worse. For example, if you buy a new car, the temporary tax cut may be completely wiped out by higher car price (cars use lots of steel and aluminum). Owning auto company stocks will also be problematic.
5882 2018-03-02 15:02:05 Les gens qui achetent les chaufrettes pour les mains et vetements à @Decathlon, je ne vous vois pas courir dans les rues d'Ile de France pour causer une rupture de stocks !  #FauxSportifs #IleDeFrance
5883 2018-03-02 15:02:03 If the DNC was so worried about gun violence they could have done more about it. Obama allowed bump stocks, he could have outlawed them. Why didn't DNC get stronger on crimes committed with guns? Think about this ALL guns are assault weapons when in the hands of criminals!
5884 2018-03-02 15:02:00 Bump stocks, assault weapons, high capacity magazines.  Think Vegas!  58 people dead and what has changed?   #NeverAgain

5896 2018-03-02 14:59:30 Respectfully disagree.  Free trade is good for all.  It's fundamental to capitalism. Raising the cost of aluminum for American breweries in order to try to save jobs in Aluminum undermines Free Market core principles. It's never been a winning strategy as indicated with stocks

5906 2018-03-02 14:57:59 @RealDonaldTrump It is obvious that you got your Economics Degree from Trump University! Nixon's tariffs on steel killed the industry and wiped out 200000 jobs. Are you the "jobs president" or the "jobs killer president"? Stocks are down. Trade wars will hurt us. #Winning? #MAGA?
5907 2018-03-02 14:57:52 Wall street firms scamming everyone with fraudulant market manipulation, using any excuse to trash stocks, complete SCAM. And

5910 2018-03-02 14:57:13 Why can’t someone develop an investment fund that follows an index but kicks out the perceived 10-20% of the worst stocks? It is very hard to pick winners, but it is not as hard, not as risky, to avoid losers.
5911 2018-03-02 14:56:47 Interesting side note:

Also. Pot stocks. They own serious pot stocks.
5912 2018-03-02 14:56:28 IE: One time bonuses v Actual pay rate increases, bump stocks v effective gun legislation, extending CHIP for 10 years v providing reasonable funding for CHIP, a few individual sanctions v universal Russian Sanctions, ect...can you see the pattern emerging?

5987 2018-03-02 14:40:21 After taking a look at website they sell stocks and gun safety equipment regardless if they did sell guns it still is discrimination just like places who won't sell to you if you support Trump it's called breaking the law
5988 2018-03-02 14:40:17 帰還×3だよ
5989 2018-03-02 14:40:15 It is called hypocrisy.  Obama had the chance to do something about guns when he had the house and senate.  What did he do?   Approve bump stocks that make guns shoot faster.  Totally related.
5990 2018-03-02 14:40:00 "Stocks down for the year." Thank you Donald Trump.
5991 2018-03-02 14:39:55 STOCKS ARE DOWN FOR THE YEAR SO FAR. 

I guess we all can thank @realDonaldTrump who is very busy bullying American citizens on twitter. We are in deep shit!
5992 2018-03-02 14:39:47 Wrong!  HE canceled when staff brought him the final cost. He’s willing to put used furniture in. Spin the truth you Russian pawn.
5993 2018-03-02 14:39:46 Stocks just went down for the year thanks to trump's "trade wars are good" and "easy to win" nonsense. No one wins a trade war you moron. #DonTheCon #DotardTrump
5994 2018-03-02 14:39:32 5. If Trump or his buddies short sold stocks this week they made a lot of money.
5995 2018-03-02 14:39:31 Okay raise the age to 21 an do away with bump stocks. This is not the problem Sandra. The system failed those kids. That's the problem.
5996 2018-03-02 14:38:57 Silver acts like it has the plague; I bought it two weeks ago $.30 higher but if stocks crash, liquidity calls may take it down further.
5997 2018-03-02 14:38:49 @realDonaldTrump is going to learn a painful lesson about imposing tariffs very very soon. Watch all steel company stocks collapse in no time and potentially having to fire workers.
5998 2018-03-02 14:38:09 Stocks are officially down for the year now. #MAGA

6005 2018-03-02 14:37:16 HOW do you know mkt downtrend is NOT a result of @realDonaldTrump Tariffs. Steel stocks are down today. Just like rest of mkt $SPX. Mkt got crushed yday b/c of Gomer Powell. Simple. When he speaks, sell $SPX. For ALL of 2018. Until he wakes up or is given the axe.

6014 2018-03-02 14:36:13 @AGPamBondi Stop spreading misinformation; Bump stocks do not convert semiautomatic firearms in to fully automatic.  Bump stocks are owned by millions and have been used in a total of 1 shooting. #StopDistracting

6026 2018-03-02 14:33:43 Steel stocks added about $1 billion to their market cap following the tariff announcement yesterday while the market as a whole shed approx. $400 billion. Just a small example of the resulting math behind protectionism policies.
6027 2018-03-02 14:33:42 I can agree with the bump stocks and a better more universal background check. I don't understand why the age makes you responsible...
6028 2018-03-02 14:33:33 You're right. But will there be someone who's willing to buy stocks from a bankrupted company? It's risky
6029 2018-03-02 14:33:19 US curling gold medalists open the trading day on Wall Street. Will stocks sink like a stone? Will gains be swept away? Will companies bet the house? Will investors put up their guard? #curlingpuns

6042 2018-03-02 14:28:21 you don't need more inflation to create more jobs, slight de-flation is better for jobs until it goes to far. Gas price fell to 90 cents in late 1990s under Clinton, down from $1.11 in 1981. That's why Greenspan cut rates & warned against "irrational exuberance" in stocks.

6107 2018-03-02 14:13:27 @Deishma most of the stocks looks like heavy branches. Value investors may exist in large quantities . Free float volumes will create lots of volatility.what is you insights sir.
6108 2018-03-02 14:13:13 YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL !!!PAM Bondi is dead wrong ... BUMP stocks ARE NOT FULLY AUTOMATIC ... That means one trigger pull and multiple rounds. This is a stock that repeats the trigger pull for the operator .. THE DISINFORMATION IS OUT OF CONTROL

6110 2018-03-02 14:12:52 Question: 
What does @FoxNews , Breitbart and Trump supporters say now that the stocks are falling, after they said, all 2017 long, that Trump and only Trump made the stocks rise? Oh wait, I know. Blame the Europeans, right?

6111 2018-03-02 14:12:51 The Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is a dumb ass! She thinks bump stocks turn semi automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons how ignorant can one person be? @PamBondi  you are one special kind of dumb! @realDonaldTrump  W. T.F. ?

6113 2018-03-02 14:12:40 How about she gets more money to the middle class and repeals that $1.5tr tax giveaway so companies can buy their own stocks back??

How in the world does this family of grifters expect people to enroll their kids in sports when they can't afford heating costs???
6114 2018-03-02 14:12:22 Thursday's closes: Dollar Index -0.289 (-0.32%), EUR/USD +0.0073 (+0.60%), USD/JPY -0.44 (-0.41%). The dollar index on Thursday retreated from a 1-1/2 month high & closed lower on the slump in stocks, which boosted safe-haven demand for the yen & sent USD/JPY down to a 1-week low
6115 2018-03-02 14:12:20 Pam bondi is lying on fox news, bump stocks DO NOT make semi-auto's fully automatic
6116 2018-03-02 14:12:14 BET ON IT
if the Orange Con tanks stocks
with his puerile understanding of tariffs
which are a tax on consumers

Treason is fine with them
their patriotism is a lie anyway
but greed & money?
That's the 1 value they'll stand up for

6118 2018-03-02 14:12:04 To my #GOP friends who in 2009 predicted collapsing stocks, rising yields, exploding deficits, a falling dollar and global economic chaos, you were finally right. You just had which party was in power wrong.

6120 2018-03-02 14:12:01 You are welcome to your opinion. Stocks I believe are going to 100 produce more joy at 90 than at 50. Not to mention one has to delve into why Mr. Market is wrong. $OSTK
6121 2018-03-02 14:11:44 What happened to universal background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the min age? All baby steps and all opposed by the NRA. Are you walking that back now? What happened to saying no the NRA?

6123 2018-03-02 14:11:19 An action like Trump's tariffs has huge and predictable effects on the stocks prices of certain companies.  Huge opportunities for insider trading/graft & we know very little about his personal finances.
6124 2018-03-02 14:11:16 Honestly today traders should just take a step back, sell and let the market readjust itself. @CNBC @petenajarian @jimcramer @jonnajarian #thestreet #investment #Dow #premarket #tariff #volatility #stocks
6125 2018-03-02 14:11:16 Stocks found support from the unexpected decline in U.S. weekly jobless claims by -10,000 to a 48-year low of 210,000, and the unexpected +1.7-point increase in the U.S. Feb ISM manufacturing index to a 13-3/4 year high of 60.8, stronger than expectations of -0.4 to 58.7.
6126 2018-03-02 14:11:11 There was also weakness in energy stocks after crude oil prices fell -1.95% to a 2-week low.

6128 2018-03-02 14:10:25 the current correction -- a bull market rally has completely erased the decline in stocks within a matter of weeks or months. In other words, while stock market corrections are actually quite common, occurring about once every two years, they tend to be short-lived.

6131 2018-03-02 14:09:40 This stock market selloff is going to make so many multimillionaires so much money! The 1% will use this volatile, uncertain time to dump all their crappy retail stocks and other trash holdings and then they'll re-buy their FAANGs and other winners at 10-15% off.

6133 2018-03-02 14:09:16 Trump said he doesn't care for the decline in stocks with steel comments. Hilarious! 
With that...I'd like to add the things he REALLY doesn't care about..environment..dreamers..healthcare..truth..opioid addictions..justice system..illegal loans..automatic weapons.
6134 2018-03-02 14:08:21 U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar are all falling together, as the price of gold is rising.  It looks like we are already losing the #TradeWar before the first shot has even been fired!
6135 2018-03-02 14:08:16 Taking our guru-inspired model based on Buffett and applying it to South African equities and giving investors in S. Africa the ability to invest in the long run in Buffett like stocks via @EasyEquities. This is very cool!
6136 2018-03-02 14:07:26 yes , là tt le monde est focus sur la paire alors que l'autre était parmi les neuf autres. Deja que les stocks sont archi limités , vue la maxi demande on a très peu de chance d'être sélectionné, mais bon c'est le jeu mdr 
6137 2018-03-02 14:06:29 Asian stocks tumbled due to trade concerns as the Nikkei Stock Index fell to a 2-week low. A surge in the yen to a 1-1/4 year high against the dollar also undercut Japanese stocks after BOJ Governor Kuroda said the BOJ will start thinking about how to exit QE around 2019.
6138 2018-03-02 14:06:25 Asian stocks settled lower: Japan -2.50%, Hong Kong -1.48%, China -0.59%, Taiwan -0.81%, Australia -0.74%, Singapore -0.99%, South Korea -1.44%, India closed for holiday.
6139 2018-03-02 14:06:01 European Commission President Juncker said Europe will respond "firmly" to any new duties. An unexpected decline in German Jan retail sales also pressured European stocks.

6141 2018-03-02 14:05:35 Stocks are falling on concern economic growth and global trade may suffer because of the planned U.S. tariffs on foreign metal imports.

6143 2018-03-02 14:05:15 How's the gun control legislation going? Did you sign Executive Order banning bump stocks? Was that a distraction from the trade war you just started? #NeverAgain
6144 2018-03-02 14:03:40 hes getting ideas from both sides, says what they want to hear to get them to talk, let dems propose full ban to expose their true stance then pass background checks & ban bump stocks which is fine. He met with NRA & ban is not on the table, control & safety is.
6145 2018-03-02 14:03:32 So not giving up parts of our rights and freedoms to appease the democrats is bowing to the @NRA ? coming to a comprimise isnt just seeing how much of our rights we retain, its meeting halfway. We both give and get. Ex: we give you bump stocks you give us reciprocity.
6146 2018-03-02 14:03:28 Maybe Trump shorted a bunch of stocks.
6147 2018-03-02 14:03:24 #Stocks,#Indexes Generally when noise impacts a final common path, i.e., an output carrying a signal and affected by exogenous, non-signal factors, the signal's effect will simply be displaced from its original starting level. And so a rally may start at a lower, or upper, point.

6149 2018-03-02 14:03:03 According to Brugler Report, the USDA reported, 174.5 mbu of soybeans were crushed for oil during Jan, better than expected. That was down from Dec but 1.56% above Jan 2017. They also reported 2.229 bln pounds of soy oil stocks at the end of Jan, above most expectations.

6159 2018-03-02 13:59:44 Selling picks and shovels to the tech gold rush. Far smarter, IMO, than betting on tech stocks.
6160 2018-03-02 13:58:23 3. The tariffs, depending on how they are designed, may hurt the United States economy much more than they help.

That’s why the markets are spooked. The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 586 points before closing yesterday down 420 points, and world stocks slumped overnight
6161 2018-03-02 13:58:14 I don’t boycott a company b/c I think the loss of my business is going to send their stocks plummeting. I do it b/c time in this life is limited and I work hard for my money, and I don’t want to contribute either of those for their financial benefit when they’re morally bankrupt.
6162 2018-03-02 13:58:09 Terrible decision
6163 2018-03-02 13:57:35 It's surprising how so called fundamental experts give very short term targets for stocks. People listen to them and lose money. But still they come next week giving more short term ideas. Who checks wat they had said last week anyways

We won’t tank stocks, kill jobs, and sell off America to Russia like @realDonaldTrump and @JohnCornyn do.
6171 2018-03-02 13:53:26 Ed! Are you watching the news? I am guessing that you don't. He has had multiple meetings with congressional members for all to see live on tv! He is banning bump stocks for starters and working with congress to increase the age to 21across the nation to obtain weapons & more.

6173 2018-03-02 13:53:00 But the liberals blame the guns . . . because, if they aren't locked up, they sneak out at night and commit horrible crimes no matter who they belong to or how they were acquired. Especially the semi-autos with bump stocks and large capacity magazines.
6174 2018-03-02 13:52:54 You may think these tariffs are a good reason to buy steel stocks, and you’d be dead wrong. Steel prices, like fuel, are hedged out on futures contracts. By the time tariffs impact price and increase margins, it’s likely the political dynamic will have changed *dramatically*..
6175 2018-03-02 13:52:35 Experts saya we cautioned that market will correct. You are right. It doesn't mean that waa right advice. 
Markwt corrected just 10-30%... This is nothing....that too after going up.... Individual stocks have gone atleast 30-50% since experts have been advising

6224 2018-03-02 13:40:52 Stocks tumble around the globe in the wake of President Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum - 25% and 10%, respectively - which are raising fears of a potential trade war. Let's Blame Trump? Keep getting Screwed Globally? Quit Panicking.
6225 2018-03-02 13:40:43 @realDonaldTrump Negotiating with trade partners in public is a good idea sometimes. Stocks will bounce when they figure it out.
6226 2018-03-02 13:40:33 Bump stocks.. put the thumb of your trigger finger thru your belt loop and the recoil creates a bump stock. Dont forget to ban belt loops.

6228 2018-03-02 13:39:32 Will you still be yelling in June when stocks have lost 30% of their value before the bottom levels? You are the biggest liar and the worst person ever elected to this position, a screaming baby. Also, some PT would really help your back, as you are looking more stooped each day.

6232 2018-03-02 13:38:24 Trump....you are killing my stocks. Shut your pie hole before they drop anymore.
6233 2018-03-02 13:38:18 Just like his statement on bump stocks, nothing will be done.  He is such a wus.
6234 2018-03-02 13:38:17 Trump announced the increased tariffs on aluminum and steel lastnight. Guess who owns a bunch of stocks that deal with aluminum and steel. Y’all ever loss 450 dollars in a single second ?

6243 2018-03-02 13:35:08 i couldn't agree more, I have no generally been skeptical of this market since 2009, with a few exceptions. But I became exceptionally risk averse in January, when it seemed like people were buying stocks regardless of price. I think we have entered a significant bear market now.
6244 2018-03-02 13:34:22 Chris, the NRA is being foolish. We, who have hearts, want common sense gun rules. No silencers, Bump stocks, assault rifles. Ppl need hunting guns and Domestic protection guns-ONLY. Teens can get hands on assault guns. OR SEIZE ALL GUNS!! HMMMM

6247 2018-03-02 13:34:17 At this very moment, President Trump is addressing, School Shootings, Opioid epidemic, Aluminum and Steel import tariffs, gun reform ( bump stocks, raising age to 21, background check etc) DACA, border security and more that we are not aware of...all of this in one day!
6248 2018-03-02 13:34:07 My father would love your tactics. Stocks will go back up today I'll bet.
6249 2018-03-02 13:33:59 @SenFeinstein ....now you say right next to the President when he said he was bypassing Congress, thank God, to get rid of bump stocks and YOU applauded ans smiled. Why not give the President some credit for being more on your side- the left-wing on this issue!

Co incidence a number of shares gradually rising today ?
6252 2018-03-02 13:33:27 The tariffs will hurt most Americans. It will inflate prices. It's killing my stocks. Bad.
6253 2018-03-02 13:33:26 We've had over 9 years of "bad news = good news" for US stocks.We now appear to be entering a period where "bad news = bad news". This is happening coincident with stretched valuations, vol normalization, and other signs of criticality. Could be an interesting balance of the year
6254 2018-03-02 13:33:26 Stocks rise on earnings expectations. They also fall. Those expectations arebeing impacted by YTD data, rising yields/rates, higher inflation, lower margins, trade and real wars, so much more. All of the excuses for the selling may be about declining earn expectations.
6255 2018-03-02 13:33:24 All 30 Dow stocks fall in premarket trade
6256 2018-03-02 13:33:15 Our current president sent markets into a slump yesterday with his plan to tax steel. Well today is a new day. Buy the stocks you want to own or get more of while they are on sale.
6257 2018-03-02 13:33:10 Ways to reduce gun violence
>Reduce weapon lethality - magazines, automatic, bump stocks
>Restrict sales - age, MH, domestic violence, other crimes
>Waiting periods - reduce impulsive acts
>Let law abiding folks keep all other guns
>Gun research?
6258 2018-03-02 13:32:51 Trump proclaims he wants to increase age to buy guns to 21, ban bump stocks, “no due process” THEN: Meets w NRA to extort more money. Done.

6279 2018-03-02 13:27:53 Shootings may not be on the rise, but deaths from shootings are. Might this have anything to do with the easy availability of assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity mags?

6286 2018-03-02 13:26:44 The NRA and the politicians under its thumb will say anything to divert attention from the availability of AR15’s, large capacity magazines, and bump stocks that allow mass casualties in shootings.
6287 2018-03-02 13:26:30 with Beaufort out we might really see some stocks like #LION & #TYM starting to perform as there is less float. Beaufort must have been selling into every rise.

#TYM is already picking up.
6288 2018-03-02 13:25:56 I tried to say this for some time that the market has no justification at these prices and buy SPXS, or buy out of the money put options for protection. Dow down 251 this morning.  Stocks tumble as Trump sets stage for trade war! #Stocks #Commodities #ETF #Invest

6290 2018-03-02 13:25:47 It will be taxed to death effectively stripping out 40%+ of any profitability. Nothing more than a cash grab by the federal liberals disguised as an attempt to "regulate". Weed stocks are Canada's version of bitcoin (at the moment). My guess - 15% Or less (companies) will survive
6291 2018-03-02 13:25:42 4 questions are fair. Answering for me not Jester, 21+ seems like good start. We should focus on arms with ability to use large capacity magazines, maybe limit rifle magazine to 10 or less bullets, suppressors & bump stocks are no needed. Common sense include universal background

6348 2018-03-02 13:09:07 Bizarre mais ça arrive parfois sur des stocks de vieux jeux.
En tout cas, ma main à couper que ce jeu existe en blister classique PlayStation.

6350 2018-03-02 13:06:51 As usual you choose the worst possible direction for America. Tariffs will hurt everyone. So now even the rich will be up for getting rid of you with stocks crashing. Do you consult with morons and then decide on policy?
6351 2018-03-02 13:06:45 Buy stocks!
6352 2018-03-02 13:06:39 1- It’s really a perfect impersonation
2- is there nothing else a president could be tweeting about besides his ego? Maybe: 
White House chaos
Directives to stop Russian meddling
Russian sanctions
DACA
Gun reforms
Stocks tanking

Really anything

6354 2018-03-02 13:05:09 You split the hair when you mentioned bump stocks which you know doesn’t make a gun fully automatic. The guns I showed before shoot the same bullet as the high powered AR you’re so scared of.
6355 2018-03-02 13:05:04 Buy stocks?
6356 2018-03-02 13:04:33 Spotify is going public. I just hope it doesn't recommend random stocks that you might want to buy.

6362 2018-03-02 13:02:34 Children & the others need a law that gets rid of previous semi automatic & bump stock sales as well. So your  guns will become illegal. They need a retroactive gun sale law. They need to fight for that. Out law all bump stocks & semi automatics.
6363 2018-03-02 13:01:24 While the #TariffTantrum is all the rage keep in mind that the catalyst for the #StockMarket drawdown was wage / #inflation fear. Just a couple of days ago #stocks fell because folks thought #Powell was bearish. The fall in 10s should stabilize markets. 2 #Fed rates hikes anyone?

6365 2018-03-02 13:00:45 Exactly! These massacres would not occur if not for the availability of assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc. It is probably the easiest part of the whole equation.

Get over yourself!!
6369 2018-03-02 12:59:57 How far did you bend over? Can’t imagine it was very far with that awkward body of yours but am sure you gave our kids up for the 10s of millions you & @HouseGOP pocket from @NRA yearly. Let me guess, reversing ban on bump stocks now? #BanAssaultWeapons
6370 2018-03-02 12:59:46 97% support universal background checks

6377 2018-03-02 12:58:07 People want bump stocks banned. Why? If you truly believe guns don’t need to be banned because they do not kill people without a bad person to pull the trigger, why be against attachments for them? It makes 0 sense not to blame guns, but blame an attachment for a gun. #2A
6378 2018-03-02 12:57:46 @Sen_JoeManchin 
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list
Boycott NRA
Vote out NRA puppets

6379 2018-03-02 12:57:34 Why did the stocks go down?!?  They should have soared!!!!!!
6380 2018-03-02 12:55:59 Keep the lies coming America now sees through them.  They know what bump stocks and semi automatic weapons do. The next generation will stop you and the NRA along with the rest of us. Argue your lies all you want it will no longer make a difference.
6381 2018-03-02 12:55:57 Most of the guys in fact start out losing consistently. Also my current situation in US Equities, been profitable in crypto but stocks are just waay more complicated. Finding it hard to have the patience needed in stocks like i have with cryptos.
6382 2018-03-02 12:55:52 They’re not real... until they are. And then aren’t. I swear to you Trump is shorting stocks

6386 2018-03-02 12:54:27 -Universal background checks
-Raising age limit to 21 
-Banning bump stocks 

All poll well with GUN OWNERS

Yet the NRA who claims to represent the interests of said gun owners want none of that. 

Would hurt their bottom line to sell more guns.

6389 2018-03-02 12:51:17 You can be sure as hell that Eric Prince of Darkness and Beast 666 in law were short selling stocks
6390 2018-03-02 12:51:02 I believe @realDonaldTrump does deserve praise for taking a stand in favor of eliminating bump stocks unilaterally, for raising the age to acquire certain weapons, and for standing up to the NRA. Thank you for doing that.  @POTUS
6391 2018-03-02 12:50:19 Ya and people should never buy bonds, only penny stocks.

If you run a masternode, you're essentially a cuck.

6393 2018-03-02 12:49:36 Bump stocks? Why? He didn’t have one and why punish the people that use them the right way? That just ridiculous!

6396 2018-03-02 12:48:44 L.L. Bean announced they will no longer sell rifles to anyone under the age of 21. The major outdoor retailer only sells guns specific to hunting and target shooting. They do not carry assault-style or high-capacity firearms, bump stocks or handguns of any kind.
6397 2018-03-02 12:48:32 I’m not talking about guess-work stocks, I’m talking about simply putting the money into Roth IRA’s and CD’s.  It would have had a guaranteed value higher than what he currently has with no risk.

On the other note sure, if you’re completely unethical.
6398 2018-03-02 12:48:27 Ignoring the obvious, that the President is an idiot...  He sure would make the ultimate insider trading partner: "Hey buddy, invest in steel & aluminum I'm about to makes its stocks go up, and sell stocks in anything that uses those materials they are going to drop."
6399 2018-03-02 12:47:46 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, boycott NRA, vote out its puppets. #NeverAgain!
6400 2018-03-02 12:47:21 Semi-Automatic weapons are still dangerous. Especially when they're modified with bump stocks.
6401 2018-03-02 12:47:14 In this market even the stocks stronger than the market suck. The market isn’t very strong right now. At least short-term. Hold positions and wait for new, fresh signals.
6402 2018-03-02 12:47:11 Does anybody know who stocks @taulman3D Alloy 910 in black in the UK? I've been struggling to find it.
6403 2018-03-02 12:47:08 So the president is a liar then? Because his own words say otherwise. 

So which is it Mr Progressive? Are you supporting a liar or a gun grabber? 

Or is he so mentally incompetent he doesn’t know what he said about bump stocks, due process, and minimum ages?
6404 2018-03-02 12:46:44 Have you checked stocks yesterday and today ? If you are grading him on this you’ll be sorry.

6414 2018-03-02 12:43:23 Stay the course don't let them trick you. When they tell you bump stocks are actually good, they're not talking about Wall Street. Oh BTW, IHOP has the best pancakes.
6415 2018-03-02 12:43:04 My stocks still haven’t recovered.
6416 2018-03-02 12:42:14 this is totally unacceptable, the landowner is nowhere near acting in the local communities interest, in the old days they would have been put in the stocks
6417 2018-03-02 12:42:13 Or because gun manufacturers find clever ways on bypassing rules, usually at the expense of making guns look retarded (California rifle stocks come to mind). If you want to reduce carnage, legislation must actually impact how lethal weapons are, or who has access to them.

6427 2018-03-02 12:38:41 The biggest concern for the Fed right now should be that the dollar is falling but stocks are not going up. If even a weaker dollar is not working, then the time for the QT experiment may be running out faster than they thought.
6428 2018-03-02 12:38:31 Curious if someone in trumps camp bought or shorted stocks in advance @FEC

6430 2018-03-02 12:38:25 AMZN and BA price suggest otherwise, after all, they are the poster boy stocks for this melt up and they haven’t faded a wink
6431 2018-03-02 12:38:09 The point is that regulation is coached in terms of specific features of guns (ban bump stocks) which legislators have been infamously ignorant about. Predictably, attempts to ban specific features have done jack (since those features do nothing to impact usability by criminals)
6432 2018-03-02 12:36:44 @realDonaldTrump congratulations. Your announcement to impose a tariff on imported steel and aluminum just dropped the Dow by 500 points. Automotive industry stocks just got hit by a drop as well. Good job. Give us a thumbs up. You jackass.
6433 2018-03-02 12:36:32 "That could really spook the market," said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. "The biggest wildcard would be a trade war and nobody should be excited for that." Chaikin also noted some of the pressure seen in stocks is in response to the news on tariffs.
6434 2018-03-02 12:36:21 @realDonaldTrump has been consistent about benchmarking himself to #StockMarket. Make no mistake: #Stocks will absolutely puke on tariffs. They might be politically expedient for #AmericaFirst but they will make aluminum prices more expensive for American companies #TrumpSellOff
6435 2018-03-02 12:35:58 If you are in stocks, start loading up on American steal and aluminum manufactures!! Next week you see a big spike! #thanktrumptariffs #buyamerican #jobscominghome tarriff is 25% on steal indefinitely.

6437 2018-03-02 12:35:14 I finished college and wish to pursue a proficiency course on Stocks Market. How may I enroll ? #TradingBell
6438 2018-03-02 12:34:45 Livestock numbers up, questionable Safrina crop in Brazil, world endying stocks look to be lower.  All bullish factors just nothing sexy or dramatic to make major moves like the Argentina weather in the meal market.  IMHO
6439 2018-03-02 12:33:09 Then you aren't paying much attention. Because everywhere I go, mental health is right at the top of the list, along with, yes, of course, banning assault weapons and bump stocks and other measures. You should thank these kids for sparking a national discussion & not letting up.
6440 2018-03-02 12:32:05 Exactly..you can even go really primitive and fashion a belt loop for rapid fire... if you know what you're doing.
Banning bump stocks meh. The technology is our there and can be reproduced. Digi  trigger is a newer model of bump like apparatus..and Congress is clueless.
6441 2018-03-02 12:30:52 U.S. stocks plunged and Treasuries climbed Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to impose substantial tariffs on foreign metals.
6442 2018-03-02 12:30:27 he did the other day. and unsurprisingly apparently his original plans to ban bump stocks and raise the age limit for buying rifles and shotguns went out the door odds are cause some money foudn its way into his personal account as it often does when the NRA feels threatened
6443 2018-03-02 12:30:26 Except there's nothing we can do about knives, but there's something we can do about assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, background checks, bump stocks, etc. without violating the 2nd Amendment.
6444 2018-03-02 12:30:25 Look closely at who took a short position in aluminum or Steel and related Industries. Who took position in stocks knowing this was going to happen? Everything will probably reverse if Trump changes his position but people make big money on this move, follow the money
6445 2018-03-02 12:30:23 what stocks does he own
6446 2018-03-02 12:30:19 Yesterday, steel stocks gained USD 2 Bn, while the rest of the market lost USD 350Bn. #DowJones #Trump
6447 2018-03-02 12:29:17 Not sure if Bra Stocks sounds like a terrible or fantastic festival.
6448 2018-03-02 12:26:26 Yeah but he probably moved his stocks ahead of time and made money and then he’ll move them back and say they’re not doing it, so he’ll make a bunch more when it goes back up. You bet he’s making money on it or he wouldn’t be doing it!!!  He doesn’t care in what’s best for US!
6449 2018-03-02 12:25:47 I hear it's pretty manic at Asda Dunbar.Folk queuing for bread. Out of flour,no yeast, no milk and stocks of alcohol are perilously low.
6450 2018-03-02 12:25:24 He’s banning bump stocks so what are you talking about
6451 2018-03-02 12:25:07 How are the bra stocks?
6452 2018-03-02 12:24:58 No, the point is that they will ban ALL high capacity magazines. That is where this all leading until more extreme measures are taken. Trump is purported to be outlawing the bump stocks. All devices that serve the same function as the bump stock will be gone as well.

6454 2018-03-02 12:24:34 Does your meeting with NRA mean you are not going to raise the age to purchase a rifle to 21?  Does this mean you are not going to outlaw bump stocks? Does this mean background investigation are going to mean nothing?  Does this mean you won't make schools safe for children?

6468 2018-03-02 12:20:03 @POTUS I agree that guns should be taken away from thugs, people who have a felony conviction, those who have a mental problem, those who have threaten violence, and no bump stocks should be allowed. I am a NRA member.
6469 2018-03-02 12:19:59 Ben, great respect for your personal talents.  What logic brings you to agree with banning aftermarket devices like bump stocks? You’ve stated the intent of the second amendment is for the people to defend themselves from tyranny. Patriots didn’t throw rocks.
6470 2018-03-02 12:19:24 Very alarming- trying to buy some more stocks- insider trading?
6471 2018-03-02 12:19:23 the reason they used for stocks going up was earnings - earn is the only reason why stocks go up. Earn must also be why they go down. All the reasons used now to explain the selling are really reasons why earn will be heading lower but they won't admit it yet.
6472 2018-03-02 12:19:12 Protectionist stance spurred a sharp downturn in the U.S. Stocks, with the S&P 500 Index briefly falling below its 100-day moving average and closing 1.4 percent lower. Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.8 percent, while Japan’s Topix index closed 1.8 percent lower
6473 2018-03-02 12:19:09 Ok my nursing nursing will have stocks only on the month of april........bro......how long must i wait???????
6474 2018-03-02 12:18:28 You just tanked the stocks and forced us all to now to pay more. You obviously fell asleep during school when they talked about business. Are you trying to destroy America on purpose?
6475 2018-03-02 12:17:47 Internal  inflation should lead to lower bonds & stocks, global trade war will make it hard for the US dollar to catch a bid because of rising inflation & monetary lag. Deflation for the rest of the world w/ capacity slack. What's needed is a US pivot & stimulus to reduce shock.
6476 2018-03-02 12:17:31 Your protectionist stance spurred a sharp downturn in U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 Index briefly falling below its 100-day moving average and closing 1.4 percent lower.

6477 2018-03-02 12:17:19 Come on, what's wrong with some mindless ramping ... See it every day with stocks
6478 2018-03-02 12:16:45 If we spent even half the time we do talking about gun control and “bump stocks” etc... on mental health/ illness we’d be a lot closer to a solution
6479 2018-03-02 12:16:28 Yeah that is true guess the market will be red again today so aks going back down. Will see how things look around 10:30-11:00.
6480 2018-03-02 12:16:01 Time to stay with top quality stocks . Index will be choppy
6481 2018-03-02 12:15:49 yup! when they have new stocks, yes. rn they're running low that's why everything's at 10php an item
6482 2018-03-02 12:15:35 Dow down 200 points, as U.S. stocks get set to resume tariff-driven selloff, fueled by latest Trump remarks
6483 2018-03-02 12:14:31 Company spokeswoman Carolyn Beem says L.L. Bean only sells firearms at its flagship store in Maine and only guns specific to hunting and target shooting.

She says L.L. Bean does not carry assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, bump stocks or handguns of any kind.
6484 2018-03-02 12:12:21 C'mon.  This is intentional---stocks have crashed SO THAT TRUMPIAN CROANIES can buy up cheaply . . . Mid of next week, he'll reverse his decision and make them all rich.
6485 2018-03-02 12:12:16 Absolutely agree, David. 

PS Have they had a milk delivery today? Stocks running low!
6486 2018-03-02 12:11:56 The beauty of stocks is that they are equities, which will appreciate in value for patient shareholders. Big goals are marathons, not sprints.
6487 2018-03-02 12:11:45 Yes, that is exactly the solution, more gun control! Ban AR-15’s !! No bump stocks, no more gun shows!!!
6488 2018-03-02 12:10:53 A popular volatility carry trade on Wall Street mostly entailed betting for the VIX’s price to remain subdued, if not fall, and using the proceeds from that wager to buy stocks on their dips.
6489 2018-03-02 12:10:53 Really? So religious....

We plea repeatedly to ban sale of military assault weapons (pulverizes insides), bump stocks, silencers?!

What about Russian sanctions on proven tampering with our Nation’s electoral process?!

What about the process to prevent future tampering?!
6490 2018-03-02 12:10:53 Depending on the item: Comparison and in some cases it indicates quality and life span. If you are talking of stocks and derivatives there are other reasons.
6491 2018-03-02 12:10:27 Just because you Liberals have redefined the definition of "assault weapon", does not make it so. OUR President is working to eliminate "bump stocks", which can make a "semi-automatic" weapon into the equivalent of an "assault weapon", support OUR PRESIDENT!
6492 2018-03-02 12:09:46 Just because you Liberals have redefined the definition of "assault weapon", does not make it so. OUR President is working to eliminate "bump stocks", which can make a "semi-automatic" weapon into the equivalent of an "assault weapon", support OUR PRESIDENT!
6493 2018-03-02 12:09:43 What’s easy is the Trump cabal went long on Steel stocks & short on the mkt prior to yesterday

6495 2018-03-02 12:09:25 Bonds fluctuate based on interest rates, while stocks fluctuate on volume. Over the long term investors typically will earn less ROI from a bond than a stock.
6496 2018-03-02 12:08:39 Stocks will be lower in 2 weeks
6497 2018-03-02 12:07:19 The last few weeks was an almost perfect bull trap for dip buyers of stocks.

After such a large and quick flush it's best to be more tactical when adding positions. Especially when index prices are near support levels.
6498 2018-03-02 12:06:46 A misconception people have is risk between bonds and stocks. Over the long term, bonds are actually more risky than stocks.
6499 2018-03-02 12:06:44 Thought so. Large number of experts feel fall in Stock prices of Metal cos,,some expect increase like Metal cos stocks in US. Both are speculating. I think it impact will be negligible. Indian exporters are way down on the list of US importers.
6500 2018-03-02 12:06:35 @Vanguard_Group Unacceptable answer: "we believe that mutual funds are
  not the best way to address social change." If you won't divest gun stocks, I'll divest you. #Enough
6501 2018-03-02 12:06:35 I had a discussion yesterday with NRA supporters. They repeatedly said ban on AR-15 would not help because there are over 2 million already sold.But, a few of them support banning bump stocks. I have two riduculous questions on this. Saying we already have AR-15's
6502 2018-03-02 12:06:15 Nothing new in it. Fake analysts daily on business channels makes aam aadmi fool. Dedicated investor /trader focuss on stocks.
6503 2018-03-02 12:06:10 A bump stock ban will only force someone to sell bump stocks with appendages that stop the movement.  The end user can the cut/file/break the appendages and they will have a bump stock.
6504 2018-03-02 12:05:55 Awesome but sell sporting weapons or a nice S&W protective revolver.  Who wants to see a beautiful gun locker displaying AK47 & AR15.  I like the lovely wood stocks & metal barrel of a well made 12, 18 or 22 gauge to hunt & target shoot.
6505 2018-03-02 12:05:26 it should, but if entire mkt goes down then it will unfortunately go down as well
6506 2018-03-02 12:04:13 Wonder which stocks have really high Beaufort Nominee holdings.  Could be ones to focus on. Sticky holdings now.

I told him he can teach me!

6515 2018-03-02 11:59:47 Hm, have to weigh up the balance. I've a selection of Cider Brandy, Gin, Remy or Southern Comfort to choose from... stocks running low methinks.
6516 2018-03-02 11:59:27 If I had known trump was going to take that position I could have shorted some stocks and made out very nicely.
I wonder if any of trump's pals did just that?
6517 2018-03-02 11:59:08 I know! I installed a hump stock on myself for a few years back in college and I gayed all over the place. It’s true, hump stocks do make it more fun to gay, but in the wrong hands it’s really dangerous. Ban hump stocks!

6519 2018-03-02 11:58:50 That is like saying if I had bought Amazon stocks from day 1 instead of starting a business I would be more rich.

Second sentence about your comment on not paying taxes, cheap labors, cut costs, etc.
6520 2018-03-02 11:58:28 @Morning_Joe You do know the M-16 is the military version of the AR-15. The weight difference was when, in 1965, we went from the M-14 with wooden stocks to the almost toy like feel of the M-16. Great show!
6521 2018-03-02 11:58:19 Great. I hope you told them you are raising the minimum age, expanding background checks, banning assault rifles, bump stocks & high capacity magazines. I know you are not afraid & don’t need them so the country waits... for you to announce these new policies
6522 2018-03-02 11:58:18 BINGO!Sorry, refuse to help with that. Waiting for market to open to trade all my US stocks to foreign short bonds. #steeltariffs
6523 2018-03-02 11:58:04 Pro Tip: Build a systematic way to trade, it will remove emotion from your trading. It then become about how you executed your system and less about individual stocks.
6524 2018-03-02 11:57:19 Is this the meeting  where they remind you who's really in charge, and that you had better STFU about gun control? Bet you come out with a changed policy on bump stocks, and we never see that executive order. Or any action at all.
6525 2018-03-02 11:57:07 Free trade doesn't matter if we lose our freedom abroad. Do not ban arms, bump stocks or any weapon that can be used to protect us from gov.

6530 2018-03-02 11:54:43 Still going to push to ban bump stocks or was that not included in your NRA meeting marching orders from this meeting ... or the unannounced lunch you had with them ... or any other contact you’ve had since 17 children (none of whose funerals you attended) were slaughtered.

6532 2018-03-02 11:54:18 More guns is a ridiculous idea.
Strengthen background checks, end loopholes, ban bump stocks, and raise the minimum age for purchasing certain semi-automatic weapons.

Why is this so hard? 

Just doing one of these things is better than nothing at all.

6561 2018-03-02 11:42:06 I’m sick of being schooled on their gun terminology. Regardless of how we frame it, there’s a semantic issue with the term. We should just say, ban the guns used in the shootings at Parkland. Ban bump stocks, too. Raise the purchasing age to 21.
6562 2018-03-02 11:41:31 Makes one wonder just how much of stock gains were about earnings after all? 1.5 is the GDP avg from 2009-17, 2.3 for 2017, 2.1 for q1 of 18.

6599 2018-03-02 11:20:02 This tweet will cause a sell off in the market. Stocks will blunge because you want to “talk tough” but act like a petulant child.

6606 2018-03-02 11:17:16 Shorting may be your profit winning strategy. All penny stocks dip so that’s when you become a shark!
6607 2018-03-02 11:16:57 Listening to analysts on projecting stock trends related to rate history. How can they even try to say they looked at similar times in history as rates were never as low ? Also, saying that stocks follow yields higher seems like looking to have it both ways. Can’t watch stupidity
6608 2018-03-02 11:16:24 Quality Stocks always fall and rise. But junk never rise. Be price sensitive.
6609 2018-03-02 11:16:22 A lot of customers calling to see if we are open. We are!!! Still good stocks of fuel and rock salt
6610 2018-03-02 11:15:55 Right? Crashes global stocks, pisses off allies over tariffs. And THIS is what he wakes up thinking about?!!!! Forget the wrong name & "dieing;" THIS?!!! He has got to go!
6611 2018-03-02 11:15:55 Alot of people probably bought guns and bump stocks after that debate, The very second you start  talking about banning guns/ammo or accessories people go to the gun store. People probably don't even know what a bump stock is but bought 1 just because the gov want to ban it.
6612 2018-03-02 11:15:29 UPDATE:
Well it appears the @federalreserve doesn't care to have a strong US dollar. Strong statements one day. Weak statements the next.Stocks go up,US dollar goes down.Stocks go down brings investors to the dollar. Making for a stronger dollar with more purchasing power.....
6613 2018-03-02 11:14:21 Well I sed wen he made that empty declaration about bump stocks ,let's c wut the Friday dump would say...so let's c now wut the response 2 this is
6614 2018-03-02 11:14:11 Mate, it you had simply invested your inheritance in the top 50 stocks you would have had £6bn more - so don’t pretend you have one fucking iota about business and trade.
6615 2018-03-02 11:14:02 Wondering if anybody at the SEC paying attention to investor activity re long positions in steel and aluminum stocks ... and short positions in S&P 500 ETFs. A situation ripe for market manipulation.
6616 2018-03-02 11:13:49 Makes for interesting reading. I am currently dozing myself with @AmlyBotanicals Sleep mist & am slowly falling under its spell. Think @aliceandwhite stocks the brand
6617 2018-03-02 11:13:42 Inefficient? Carney on crack? Hope they take a sensible, pragmatic view like the US SEC did. Kids don’t trade stocks these days, that’s for old crusty folks, crypto is where innovation is at.

6622 2018-03-02 11:10:29 They aren’t that helpful as an accessory. They are using it a scapegoat to use towards banning other accessories in case they can’t ban actual guns. Odds are they’ll use bump stocks, scopes, ammo, magazines, etc to ban in the future.

6629 2018-03-02 11:07:04 Yeah, that's the part that I'm wrestling with here. Trump loves the stock market, so I'm not sure what happens if he starts to think that his actions are causing stocks to go down.

6633 2018-03-02 11:03:49 Tony Robinson is doing a Baldrick here. He was tricked into using that supermarket 40 years ago and is too stupid to realise it charges 25% more than all other shops and only stocks the flavours of stuff that it’s managers approve of.

6636 2018-03-02 11:02:29 Completely wrong. If you look at the stocks you now already can see the disastrous consequences of your import taxes. Europe, Japan and China will react to this and the consequences will be bad for American economy !
6637 2018-03-02 11:02:25 sure rest is incredibly strong and very underused, but its an enormous risk that will often just trade stocks even if successful. also I think puff loses to marth but I'm not exactly a master of that matchup

6643 2018-03-02 10:59:27 240 characters doesn't allow full venting on my irritation of inv who say stocks only go up on valuations that no company will earn in the next 50 years on renewed hopes/hypes of the tax/spending/tariffs plans that destroys us, not helps us, plus finTV driving this view.

6653 2018-03-02 10:53:48 What it comes down to is banning bump stocks, better security, holding people accountable and actually knowing what the fuck you are talking about. I'm no expert on firearms but it's like you aren't even trying here.
6654 2018-03-02 10:53:45 looking forward to another day of frantic masturbation from the bears every time stocks go down

I dare say Blackpool fishermen suffered as much as many from Thatcher's deindustrialisation of GB, but, isn't it true that they helped in the devastation of fish stocks, and that only EU I intervention prevented a disaster from which we are only now recovering?

6724 2018-03-02 09:55:38 It's so difficult to tell but I really get a sense the Market is in a Bear Mood and most likely to go a fair bit lower. As yet no real sense of panic and I've got lots of Stocks that are up today. We probably need some truly scary days to clean out the 'system'.

6847 2018-03-02 08:15:26 I personally don’t want smaller magazine capacities. Guns aren’t the issue, the laws regarding them aren’t what should be focused on to fix the problems we’re having. Bump stocks go for it. Age increase, sure but increase voting age too.
6848 2018-03-02 08:15:05 Happy Holi Sir. All your "keep an eye" stocks (tweet) are great compounder for long term investors. I am benefited.

6850 2018-03-02 08:11:43 If bump stocks are banned and people still use those, why would gun laws be any different?
6851 2018-03-02 08:11:10 What everyone wants is bump stocks to go away (which made the AR 15 act like an automatic weapon), and for smaller legislated magazine capacity (easily corrected by the gun manufacturers) which @marcorubio already agreed to during @CNN town hall meeting (but few were listening).

6877 2018-03-02 07:52:28 I absolutely will not stand for the repeal of the second amendment. New bill doesn't ban "bump stocks" but "rate increases". Hmm, does that include semi auto? Instead of de-clawing the Bill of Rights, why not actually fix the problem? The problem is not the guns but the PARENTS.
6878 2018-03-02 07:50:10 Hmmm... not the meeting I watched you comically preside over. You supported unilateral action to ban bump stocks, raising the min age for buying assault rifles, universals background checks and not afraid to stand up to NRA, not cross state conceal . Like DACA day after retreat!

6880 2018-03-02 07:49:22 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
6881 2018-03-02 07:46:35 Really?  Great!  How many things did you CAVE on?  I mean seriously - there is NO WAY you sat them down and used your KILLER NEGOTIATING SKILLS to get them to roll over on bump stocks, background checks and age increases.  NO WAY.

6902 2018-03-02 07:24:27 You have to have a very specific license to buy or own a fully automatic weapon in the US. A license that is not easy, nor cheap to acquire. Modding a semi-auto weapon to be full auto is illegal, and soon so will bump-stocks.
6903 2018-03-02 07:21:16 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President l. If you sign a Executive order banning bump stocks 1 it will do nothing to fight crime. Only 1 sicko used 1 in a crime ever. & 2 you’d be acting like obama. A wannabe Dictator

6935 2018-03-02 07:03:36 Can you reconsider your position on bump stocks? The first guy with a question at Creighton University had a weak argument. Bump stocks do not fall under 26 U.S.C.

6939 2018-03-02 07:01:54 HOWEVER, the "ceteris paribus" there is the key point. 
1) The largest 5, 10, and 25 stocks in S&P500 have considerable overlap with the top stocks and quintiles in R1k, R1k Growth, and MSCI ACWI
2) For people to buy ETFs at all, they need to reallocate FROM somewhere.
6940 2018-03-02 07:01:23 He will say let’s take guns before due process to freak out the GOP and gun lobby hoping they will come back with no bump stocks, 21 on assault rifles and AR15s, strengthen b.g. checks to hush him upSo he can use those to soften Dems on arming teachers and hardening schools.

6952 2018-03-02 06:53:18 You can easily buy something that “looks” military. The actual military weapons are obtainable, but only with a special license. Funniest part of this is that the boring old hunting rifles with wooden stocks and capabilities that surpass the AR are being ignored.

6959 2018-03-02 06:47:38 Agreed. Bump stocks need to be a class 3 item. No one ever with that license has committed such a crime. Ever. States need to report ALL crime data to the system so backgrounds can be thorough. No good is data is missing. No more loopholes.

6967 2018-03-02 06:40:45 Just change the fucking gun regulations already. No assault weapons. No bump stocks. Ten round max clips. Better background checks and 21 year old purchase age. Nobody's coming for anybody's weapons unless you're crazy. Listen to the kids! #WeCallBS
6968 2018-03-02 06:40:41 Many stocks have been having the berley thrown onto the buy side to lure in the naive...I am keeping away from recent runners.
6969 2018-03-02 06:40:15 Straw man. Military: well regulated. And civilians don’t need weapons like an AR-15, oversized magazines and bump stocks.
6970 2018-03-02 06:40:02 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
6971 2018-03-02 06:38:21 I have no issue banning assault weapons, bump stocks and allowing the Dickey Amendment to be repealed so we can honestly study and learn how to regulate

6973 2018-03-02 06:35:44 Bump stocks turn money into noise. That said, they're fun and have only once ever been used in a crime. They do nothing a belt loop can't do. I'm out on any ban. #2A #CivilRights We don't have a large mental health gun issue.
6974 2018-03-02 06:34:56 “Juanita, I hear a lot of CEOs complaining about their undervalued stocks, but I don’t see them doing anything about it,” Johnson said.
6975 2018-03-02 06:34:45 Stay the course now, don't let them trick you. When they tell you bump stocks are actually good,  they're not talking about Wall Street. Oh BTW, IHOP has the best pancakes.
6976 2018-03-02 06:33:58 You would be surprised how close we are at bipartisan solutions to these things. Good background checks making sure mentally ill people can’t buy guns, banning bump stocks, raising the age to 21, and gun show loop holes. Then from there everyone is welcome to have their guns

6978 2018-03-02 06:33:19 "Thank you" but Trump is just placating you. He won't do anything other than "try" to get bump stocks banned, IF THAT. 

The NRA wouldn't yield one inch if every newborn was currently eligible to buy an assault rifle...WITH a bump stock.
6979 2018-03-02 06:32:27 You do know that sask had 3 billion saved up and now were 3 billion in the hole! How is that money for nothing? not too mention he bought oil stocks at 100+ bucks per, gave the oil companies over 1 billion that we will never see gain!
6980 2018-03-02 06:31:39 Hehehe my kingdom for a pharmacy that stocks it. Locals eat bottle Gord until it passes. I’m sticking with plain foods. Rest up
6981 2018-03-02 06:31:38 Have you seen his signature on a bill yet? Bump stocks are an accident waiting to happen. The age thing won't happen either, there has always been some age requirement for buying ammunition.
6982 2018-03-02 06:31:17 I remember staying up everyday 5am studying stocks. I studied my heart out then school and work so tiring. Everything pays off man 
6983 2018-03-02 06:30:15 The NRA already allowed him and their other employed congressmen and senators to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. They try to sell it as being hard against the NRA now.
Try again, Trumpsters.
6984 2018-03-02 06:29:49 What speed bumps so Banning bump stocks will slow Dems down! for how long giving up full auto did not slow them long they came back stronger
6985 2018-03-02 06:29:09 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Universal BACKGOUND CHECKS AND AGE LIMIT OF 21
IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH

6996 2018-03-02 06:20:55 I don’t like the kits sold, that modify semis into autos either. Bump-stocks should be a class 3 item too. We are on same page. Good news is that all automatic “rapid” firing weapons can only be obtained by a class 3 lic holder. So they are already banned from regular gun owners.

7014 2018-03-02 06:04:10 False
The Obama admin, after a letter from the NRA, reviewed bump stocks, and the ATF findings were it had no automatic moving parts to make it illegal under they law.
7015 2018-03-02 06:03:37 Some stocks will fall more/less than the market, I use patterns to find the strongest/weakest ones and then position accordingly (long vs short)
7016 2018-03-02 06:03:21 2. A ban on bump stocks, raising the age to 21 for purchases of assault weapons (military servicepeople excluded), comprehensive background checks with restrictions for people with mental health issues of a violent nature are a big deal to the Left.

Let them have those.
7017 2018-03-02 06:03:17 Yeah. And let's put the bump stocks on the guns for them as well. Merry Christmas from the NRA

7023 2018-03-02 06:00:01 The President is a strong leader. Fixing 18-21, strengthening background checks, and outlawing bump stocks is the right thing to do.
7024 2018-03-02 05:59:25 Madam thanks . I also reciprocate the same. But please do not scare us ( small retail investors). We are entering stocks on your advice and  again exiting as per your advice  without any gain. Brokerage & Taxes taking it all.
7025 2018-03-02 05:59:22 We can have our guns thus keeping our rights. But there needs to be some regulations. Don't think the 2nd Amendment says anything about the rights to own a semi or automatic rifle. Or no background checks. Or no bump stocks.
7026 2018-03-02 05:59:16 Carefully have a look at the recent last one month recommendations since I rejoined after 29Jan18. They r stocks that have gained momentum n figuring in 52wkH Top10 or Volume Gainers. If u Buy on Fundamental Analysis which ofcourse I too do, but not for timing the entry.

3. What about Russian sanctions based on indictments?!

Now we have banks "too big to fail" and no real regulations! We have unrealistically high stocks! CAREFUL!

Steel tariffs? Why not protect our steel industry? Everyone else protects theirs.

7084 2018-03-02 05:18:40 Several indices including #NIKKEI225 #shanghaicomposite forming scary H & S pattern, after the heady Jan ramp.  Most global stock mkts and stocks look technically weak, with investor optimism set very high.  Can't rule out a crash! #SP500 .  Crypto assets sets to outperform.
7085 2018-03-02 05:18:13 At the very least, we should ban any and all military-style weapons from the civilian world. Bump stocks should go, too. We'll have to agree to disagree about AR-15s.
7086 2018-03-02 05:17:21 Nobody is takin down the NRA. Banning bump stocks and changing the AR-15 age limit to 21 has nothing to do with the NRA. This is gun legislation with real lawmakers and politicians. Welcome to US Government 101.
7087 2018-03-02 05:16:38 When did I get stocks?
7088 2018-03-02 05:16:27 Semiautomatic assault rifles and large capacity magazines >20 need to be banned based upon the fact that their sole reason for being is to kill as many people as possible. You also need to look @ certain ammo bans. Banning bump stocks isn’t enough to slow mass shootings of

7090 2018-03-02 05:14:56 This will go nowhere. No way no how. In the meantime though, R's do nothing when stocks drop because it's brief and considered collateral damage.

7096 2018-03-02 05:10:29 The ol' "Box is beat up so we'll mark it down because the serious  collectors won't want it" kind of thing, and also yeah physical stores that sell em.  I have to get all mine online. Fortunately, amazon stocks them now
7097 2018-03-02 05:10:12 Q: How can Congress say we need to address mental health, bump stocks, age limits, & automatic weapons, when they allowed the auto-weapons ban to lapse, have inadequate services for the mentally ill, and don't consistently monitor released criminals?
7098 2018-03-02 05:08:14 Currently seeking an additional advantageous revenue stream. Something with an aggressive monitary benifet that excludes:  realestate, stocks, or pipe dream mentalities. A creative facet, that drives my desire to earn a “fuck you” addition to my portfolio. 
7099 2018-03-02 05:07:33 Really? And did you convince them to support assault weapons ban, stronger background checks, raising the purchasing age, and banning bump stocks? I think not.
7100 2018-03-02 05:07:26 but your points is taken. we must be aware of news around the stocks before shorting Vega. btw March 2018 is for IDBI only. i guess it must be for other banks too ?
7101 2018-03-02 05:07:06 Somehow purchased like stocks, I can't figure it out, but a senator in Hawaii had a trust with a value of a half mil. The name on the trust I had followed from I think South Carolina. Also part trust on a 650 mil bldg in Los Angeles. Okay this is way too long, but yes, the NRA is
7102 2018-03-02 05:06:10 sounds like a good buying opportunity. Stocks dip and smart investors snap them up, only idiots or libs pass on a good deal.
7103 2018-03-02 05:05:39 The second amendment was put in place when we carried muskets.  You might want to keep in mind what the founding fathers intended.  I'll bet it wasn't bump stocks and 19 year olds shooting up their fellow school mates.
7104 2018-03-02 05:05:14 The most risky stocks at this point of time are those where earnings growth are at risk. Be with stocks where you are sure of earnings growth going ahead.
Hope stories wont work anymore as they did in past. Market will be brutal for non-performing companies.
7105 2018-03-02 05:04:42 This needs  to be said, the AR-15 is just a fancy plastic varmet gun that is good for home defense, there are far more powerful firearms. Bump stocks don't do anything special, they're actually very hard to use and very painful.
7106 2018-03-02 05:04:38 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!

7109 2018-03-02 05:03:42 It's pretty simple close the background check loophole, Gun show loopholes & ban children under 21 from owning firearms, ban bump stocks & ban assault weapons. Close up the strawman loophole and ban private sales & require mental health checks & no more guns for domestic abusers
7110 2018-03-02 05:03:38 This is when we start praying that they will receive stocks orz “orz
7111 2018-03-02 05:03:01 We know what Trump wants. We heard him clearly and that's Toomey-Manchin, raising age to 21, expanding BG checks, eliminating bum stocks. Trump even wanted to take guns first- due process second- in special cases. He wants to be the FIRST president to act on gun laws. YOU LIE.
7112 2018-03-02 05:02:56 Might not necessarily be contrarian buys sir. But even stocks of companies which have growth and numbers coming in the next 2 yrs which was not reflecting so far bcoz co might be new and stock more or less unknown to mkts

7115 2018-03-02 05:01:51 No, there is no ban on bump stocks (yet), which essentially make guns fully automatic (split the hair is you must, but REALLY dude). And the guns you showed previously are NOT "high powered"....DAMN, then what is?

7118 2018-03-02 04:58:35 Okay so they put up an order form for me. If they get the stocks I am guaranteed a copy. If they don’t they’ll let me know ^^
7119 2018-03-02 04:58:24 Man please trade cryptos instead of investing them. It’s not time for that yet. Cryptos are currencies being treated like penny stocks.

7123 2018-03-02 04:57:12 As despot donnie huddles with NRA, over a week later & still nothing done concerning gun control by this useless R congress or their anointed orange king. What was the huddle today about? don getting approval by NRA 2 actually do more than talk? Where’s your ban on bump stocks T
7124 2018-03-02 04:56:26 Sell Lilbagel's stocks
7125 2018-03-02 04:56:17 I actually think we're more on the same page  to be honest. I am against bump stocks.... I am not crazy about PR stunts, and I don't like pre-planned responses to tragedy. BUT I think we need real reform when it comes to obtaining a gun.
7126 2018-03-02 04:56:09 I know I'm pissed. P.s. bump stocks are stupid and waste ammo.
7127 2018-03-02 04:56:03 No clue, but when you get yours lmk, I ordered 6 bump stocks.
7128 2018-03-02 04:54:26 I built an AI-lite model to predict the daily price performance of the QQQ (which tracks the Nasdaq-100). It should work about two-thirds of the time.

7129 2018-03-02 04:54:17 Isn't this dependent on what stocks one has bought? Can't be generalized as even in 2000 and 2007 there were pockets of undervaluation which did well in subsequent yrs despite the index moves
7130 2018-03-02 04:52:58 Then why did he say he would ban bump stocks through executive order?
7131 2018-03-02 04:49:59 i checked twice last week and nope! gonna walk over again now to check but istg i am going to eat the person who finished all the stocks 
7132 2018-03-02 04:49:25 > Raise age limit   

May help a few things, but not much   

> Ban bump stocks   

Nothing different will happen because of that   

This is IMO of course. I consider myself a gun nut and know that guns, while part of the problem, are not the root of it.
7133 2018-03-02 04:49:13 Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back, Mr. Speaker. The jobless rate has been falling since 2009. Your reward to corporations is being used to buy back stocks, Your millions in tax cuts for your donors is making them richer, not creating jobs. #GOPCorruption

7139 2018-03-02 04:43:57 You can easily fashion a "bump harness" to the rifle, using a strap or belt, which works better than the cheap bump stocks they sell anyway...

7141 2018-03-02 04:43:28 Ok. 
Require liability insurance on all firearms. 
Tax the crap out of all ammunition. 
Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. 
Require background checks & keep people who have a history of violence and mental illness from owning weapons. 
Register every gun sale. License.
7142 2018-03-02 04:43:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

7144 2018-03-02 04:42:24 On HC alot stocks have a resident troll on it

You know the type, posts non stop day after day trolling a stock no matter what that stock does

I often think to myself fuck how much of a sad “living in your parents basement” 40 year old virgin must this loser be
7145 2018-03-02 04:42:19 So then you're just against bump stocks, which Trump already said he's going to ban with an executive order?
7146 2018-03-02 04:42:07 Well there is that. The market did not like it. But I don’t think stocks are a good thing to hit on overall.  Better fish...
7147 2018-03-02 04:41:52 Who cares about Katie Hopkins opinion and her Heart of Stone?
Let's move forward: Stand with the Kids fighting #GunViolence. Join Anti-Gun Violence Advocacy Groups. Elect Progressive Politicians. Vote NRA out of office. Boycott. And if you have investments: don't own Gun stocks.
7148 2018-03-02 04:40:52 Holy poo poo what happened today? I've been crazy busy opening a new business. Canadian pot stocks look awesome today. Why???
7149 2018-03-02 04:40:52 Because you keep mentioning bump stocks even though in recent massacre the Vegas one was the only one who used it and they still can
7150 2018-03-02 04:40:33 That one time I agree with Pres Trump on gun control. Raise age limit. Ban bump stocks. Stop being scared of the NRA.

Broken clocks and all.
7151 2018-03-02 04:40:05 So in addition to bump stocks, what else did you decide to give in on? Or I can wait till Trump tweets it out tomorrow morning.

Change my mind.
7155 2018-03-02 04:37:56 Banning bump stocks, arming schools, registering someone who's  a threat into a database, working with mental professionals and raising the age to 21 is a good place to start.  Will it stop the criminals? No. But it may prevent the next school shooting.
7156 2018-03-02 04:37:51 Okay. 1) SERIOUSLY vet anybody who want to own any kind of gun 2) 1 gun per person 3) ban assault weapons permanently 4) ban bump stocks and similar work-arounds 5) eliminate private transactions 6) eliminate gun show exceptions (loopholes) 6) keep careful track of all gun owners
7157 2018-03-02 04:37:41 As quickly as you can say “bump stocks”.
7158 2018-03-02 04:37:17 So they agreed we need to: Strengthen background checks, ban bump stocks & AR15’s, raise age to 21 for purchasing gun, reinstate & strengthen Obama’s law on mentally ill access. That would be considered a “Great Mtg.”.

7162 2018-03-02 04:35:10 Trump banning the bump-stocks you are banning all semi-auto rifles. bump-stocks is not a device but a technique, anyone can do the same rate of fire as the bump-stocks by using your finger and shoulder. I thought you were against gun control, but it seems that you are going left
7163 2018-03-02 04:34:22 #PDAC ... resources stocks often fall after this event ... will history repeat itself?
7164 2018-03-02 04:32:27 That's five rounds per second. Fully-automatic territory. With a bump stock, maybe. But not solely semi-automatic. BTW, bump stocks should be made illegal. They effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully-automatic one. Still a semi, but assist with non-standard action.
7165 2018-03-02 04:31:20 They told him not to tariff, did he listen? No! 
Stocks tumble
7166 2018-03-02 04:31:07 I’m a member of Team Marco but heartbroken about what your proposal does not include.  I thought you supported  raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles to 21, that you would ban bump stocks, and that you would deal with high capacity magazines.

7171 2018-03-02 04:28:32 Hey! Where in the constitution is the right to own bump stocks and AR-15s?
7172 2018-03-02 04:28:27 What were their instructions for you, comrade? NRA gave you “permission” to ban bump stocks last October, after the Las Vegas massacre. Why has it taken you this long?
7173 2018-03-02 04:28:26 Great! So you got them to agree to ban bump stocks, mental health and domestic abuse screening, increasing age to 21 for assault rifles, and banning psychotropic drug users from being licensed? Good job!

7176 2018-03-02 04:27:31 Eric, people are calling for the complete ban of high muzzle velocity semiautomatic (1100 ft/sec+) long guns. They are calling for the ban of bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines (30 rounds plus). They are not calling for the complete ban of all firearms.
7177 2018-03-02 04:27:04 Eh, I didn't know one shot skeet, trap and sporting clays with semi-automatic assault rifles fitted with bump stocks.

7185 2018-03-02 04:20:17 Today @GovJohnKasich proposed new gun reforms- including banning armor-piercing bullets, banning bump stocks, and removing firearms from people who pose a threat to themselves or others. Also would work to improve background checks. Thoughts??? #WLWT #GunControl
7186 2018-03-02 04:20:10 . Speaking truth to power is the finest aspect of our democracy. Until the right wing can understand that automation and poverty are what we must address, not cutting taxes so corporations can buy back stocks. People of all colors and countries are my brothers and sisters
7187 2018-03-02 04:20:05 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list #boycottNRA vote out all #NRApuppets #NeverAgain
