38 2018-03-06 23:47:59 Well now he will dig in his heels. Glad I dumped my stocks.
39 2018-03-06 23:47:52 I say open the machine gun registry and let people form1 or form4 a machine gun.
The entire reason bump stocks came to be is because of the Hughes Amendment.
40 2018-03-06 23:45:54 No OTC stocks on @RobinhoodApp though, which is cool.  No transaction fees is awesome and transactions are smooth.  You should give them a try.
41 2018-03-06 23:45:42 Try to learn at least a little bit about what you're talking about. Bump stocks can be legally purchased at gun dealers.  An easily installed bump stock makes an semi-auto AR15 fire full-auto. No laws broken, Oopsie.

44 2018-03-06 23:42:54 But apparently bump stocks that turn guns into automatic weapons are legal which is ridiculous.
45 2018-03-06 23:41:44 What type of stocks does he have??
46 2018-03-06 23:41:34 I can see 10 but 100?
47 2018-03-06 23:40:45 Crashing stocks is sticking it to those Globalists. If Gary doesn't want to be on board, good riddance. We'll ride MAGA all the way to S&P = 0.

54 2018-03-06 23:36:28 @amjoyshow @maddow Trump administration lowered capital resrv reqmts 4 banks today so he can crash Banks 4 next recession and is trying to crash the world economy so that he can buy up some more golf courses, He doesn't even buy stocks, research people, He is weakening the USA
55 2018-03-06 23:34:32 Sure have.  Pot stocks are coming back big time for the July run.  Some nice companies are forming themselves to be major players.
56 2018-03-06 23:33:12 They’re paying the people who are selling the stocks, and if 84% are owned by the top 10% then they paying the upper class. The companies aren’t investing in anything.
57 2018-03-06 23:33:03 Whatever. He lies all the time. Where’s the paper about bump stocks he promised more than a week ago?
58 2018-03-06 23:32:40 I have $100 cash, credit, stocks, bonds however you want the shit...IF you’re willing to cuddle with me on a weekly basis. You’ll get paid every week!!!

62 2018-03-06 23:31:21 Same here. Remaining stocks generally holding up well and some even making new highs this week.
63 2018-03-06 23:31:21 401ks and IRAs are all stocks... what happened to them in 08 when the market crashed? What will happen again in the next market crash?

73 2018-03-06 23:26:15 We have seen companies that have changed their policies and raised the age to buy firearms to 21. Yesterday, the Florida senate passed a bill raising the age to buy guns and ban bump stocks. Change is coming!
74 2018-03-06 23:26:09 Mr. Widen, could you please explain to the people what the Corp.'s and CEO's do next with these stocks they sit on until they retire?
75 2018-03-06 23:25:52 yall just wait til sessions resigns or is fired, mj stocks will soar for days!
76 2018-03-06 23:25:40 I see Gary Cohn is now skipping and dancing back to the Good Life, now that he's made it infinitely better for himself. Suddenly he can pretend he has ethics and standards. Must have forgotten to dump his steel stocks. Damn, Icahn should have reminded him.
77 2018-03-06 23:25:34 @newbienick because stocks rarely get killed from bullish setups. They might go down, but I highly doubt we open like this.
78 2018-03-06 23:25:03 Rest of statement: “And now I’m calling my broker and selling my stocks before the market tanks tomorrow.”
79 2018-03-06 23:24:35 58 people in Vegas could have been saved with a ban on bump stocks and AR-15s.
80 2018-03-06 23:24:31 why are black people so reluctant to buy stocks?
81 2018-03-06 23:22:24 One of the few things we agree upon, Kings Stocks it.  I prefer their Black Cherry a little more though...
82 2018-03-06 23:22:02 First off, bump stocks DO NOT make things "deadlier". Vegas shooter... Shot 2000 rounds and killed what, 50 ppl? If bump stocks actually made it deadlier, he would have killed far more than 50 ppl. Yes, that was 50 ppl too many, but your argument makes no sense.
83 2018-03-06 23:21:27 Your first experience with stocks coming off SEC suspension? The drop was normal. Now that the DTCC chill is lifted, volume will pick up some. But if no one is willing to buy, the prices may not follow. I expect there will be some recovery and more volatility..
84 2018-03-06 23:20:58 Mr stock market doesn’t think so, stocks poised to open down 350 points on this news. And guess what? Trump cares about the market. He really cares about it
85 2018-03-06 23:20:55 Most liberals/lefties I know only take issue with Trump's crony, Carl Icahn, investing $30 million in steel-related stocks. It's as if the tariffs would be fine if there was not blatant cronyism taking place.
86 2018-03-06 23:20:34 Late last year stocks would rally and turn green by 4pm now it is the opposite. They stay green and then turn red by 4 hahaha FML
87 2018-03-06 23:20:01 the passive managers take your money and put most of it into the most expensive stocks. That seems unnecessarily risky, especially in an "obscenely" overvalued market.
88 2018-03-06 23:20:00 Gary's makin' a bee-line to his broker to pull all of his stocks out of the market.
#TimeToPutYourMoneyUnderYourMattress
89 2018-03-06 23:19:07 With #GaryCohn out, #DowJones & stocks may retreat short term. Don't be surprised to see a KNEE JERK reaction by airlines, slashing #businessclass fares. They did it in Feb, & now have a reason/catalyst to do it again
90 2018-03-06 23:18:54 I had completely forgotten just how mind-numbingly stupid CNBC can be. During the Dot Com boom/ bust we'd say it would be safe to buy stocks again when CNBC turned into the Golf Channel.
91 2018-03-06 23:18:50 Dow futures declined more than 300 points after Cohn announced plans to step down. S&P 500 futures slid more than 1%.

Stocks in Japan are set to begin trading at 7 pm ET.
92 2018-03-06 23:18:34 Mr stock market (not liberal) doesn’t think so, stocks poised to open down 350 points on the news that Cohn is resigning. And guess what? Trump cares about the market.

95 2018-03-06 23:18:19  I don’t like assuming either way, but wanna be helpful at the same time . Like when most ppl sign up for a 401K they pick a diverse plan with different stocks that rebalances their investment instead of actively trading eryday. It’s low cost & lower risk, but long term.
96 2018-03-06 23:17:48 Not so fast, Mr stock market doesn’t think this is just “bye” stocks poised to open down 350 points on the news that Cohn is resigning. And guess what? Trump cares about the market.
97 2018-03-06 23:17:40 Absolutely, the quota system did preserve stocks which was the only way to ensure the industry had a long term future. True, it’s U.K. government’s short term attitude and desire for cash that screwed U.K. fisheries over. It’s why I don’t understand why people blame the EU.
98 2018-03-06 23:17:37 Stocks will plunge for days after #GaryCohn resignation
99 2018-03-06 23:17:20 He was long the stocks
100 2018-03-06 23:17:12 Remember, his billionaire friend sold all stocks in steel, after meeting with T., on the subject.
101 2018-03-06 23:17:02 Mr stock market doesn’t think so, stocks poised to open down 350 points on the news that Cohn is resigning. And guess what? Trump cares about the market.
102 2018-03-06 23:15:34 Sell all your stocks it was a good run.
103 2018-03-06 23:15:31 @realDonaldTrump There goes another one! 
Your Ec Adv Cohn leaves your chaos. 
1-2 people a week leaving!? 
WOW! 
Only good thing is Cohn was a Goldman-Sachs "Swamp-thing" that should've been in JAIL anyway!
YOU ARE A FOOL & LOSER!
Now, Stocks will take a shit again tomorrow!
104 2018-03-06 23:15:30 Gary Cohn is a narrow minded capitalist. His definition of good policy is how much it makes stocks rise. Damn the environment & local wages.
105 2018-03-06 23:15:25 $UVXY loving ittttt.... 16.50 calls, 269 puts on SPY, actual stocks i mean we loaaddeeddd
106 2018-03-06 23:15:22 American companies have already announced $178 billion in stock buybacks in 2018. How will this “trickle-down” to workers when 84 percent of all stocks are owned by the top 10 percent of American households? #GOPTaxScam
107 2018-03-06 23:15:08 It depends on whether stocks,  and thus risk, take this in their stride or we see a big market funk...former means recent lows can hold latter means a run toward longer-term channel support at 0.7580/0.7620. 

Time will tell I guess
108 2018-03-06 23:14:51 Hey!! I've been letting this bald guy yell at me about stocks for 15 minutes and I'm starting to think he is NOT @bgarlinghouse! wth @CNBC??
109 2018-03-06 23:14:18 Overstock's CEO has no understanding of blockchain technology and just wants in on the easy money train. He thinks that stocks are good candidates for tokenization! Overstock is a failing retailer with nobody with crypto experience even listed in tZero whitepaper.

Wondering, because the company doesn’t actually see any of your money... it goes to the person who sold your stock. #investing #ethics
118 2018-03-06 23:11:33 Also, they havent avoided anything. Bump stocks havent been challenged yet.
119 2018-03-06 23:11:00 Gary Cohn is resigning today because he's mad.  He didn't get the tip-off to dump stocks due to tariffs like Carl Icahn.
120 2018-03-06 23:10:35 it is time to end the sale of AR15's as well as "bump" stocks.  The only real difference between the AR15 with a bump stock and M4A4(military grade full auto rifle) is the M4 is super illegal to own.
121 2018-03-06 23:10:03 Stocks are going to drop big tomorrow. Cohn was a big Wall Street stabilizer. As the Trump admin melts down we will see more craziness
122 2018-03-06 23:09:45 The globalists are dumping their stocks
123 2018-03-06 23:09:43 You want to set up an Nasdaq index fund. You put multiple stocks in it which combined mimic nasdaqs movement. Congrats, you created an Index Fund. :)

126 2018-03-06 23:08:39 4. You lie because what you really want to do is create an incrimental approach to banning guns altogether. Want proof? Hey, how about a compromise bill where we ban bump stocks but loosen restrictions on supressors? Your answer?

128 2018-03-06 23:08:30 lol yea it ain’t even like that fr we just be talking about going to bible study and stocks you good
129 2018-03-06 23:08:14 I think there's a lot of growth already baked into the cake, though. And bond yields would still have to rise considerably before stocks at current levels would be relatively expensive. Doesn't seem like we're near the euphoria that's typical for the end of a bull market.
130 2018-03-06 23:07:53 Is that the one who dumped his stocks in steel imports just before (ie he knew) Trump announced his tariffs?
131 2018-03-06 23:07:51 The Co-op will be closed tomorrow during the snowstorm.

135 2018-03-06 23:07:20 Is 1% really a tumble?  Really?  Stocks go up and down 2-3% daily as of late. This is nothing. I expected this from MSNBC, not you guys.
136 2018-03-06 23:06:57 The performance of Netflix vs. movie/tv stocks proves your point.
137 2018-03-06 23:06:52 Nobody stocks as many joke cards as we do.
I've not set out to verify that claim, but I'm quite confident :)

138 2018-03-06 23:05:50 Hey @Emma4Change, our Governor just signed a law banning bump stocks. Us here in WA St support your efforts and want to keep all safe! #ProudWashingtonian #gunsense #NeverAgain #kidsfirst #SafetyFirst
139 2018-03-06 23:05:44 He's needs more time to short his stocks.
140 2018-03-06 23:05:41 #DVO a funny one - it's been rising over 2 weeks ish but last 6 days all Red Candles. However, Heiken Ashi Candles generally big and white over same period. For choppy Stocks HA Candles useful to cut out Noise.
141 2018-03-06 23:05:29 Stocks dropping in after hours trading. Trump fucked the markets again with his ridiculous trade war.
142 2018-03-06 23:04:59 J'ai générateur Spotify premium, 1€ minimum, mais je peux pas changer les stocks pour le moment je suis pas chez moi lol. Mais il y a des comptes fonctionnels 
143 2018-03-06 23:04:40 Wow, stocks gap down 1% on reopen. Yen and gold strengthen in reaction to US imposing tariffs.
144 2018-03-06 23:04:26 In addition to bump stocks, I want robo-calling equipment to be banned. Grrr, phone spam is sooo much more annoying than email spam.
145 2018-03-06 23:04:20 Well trading works too! I subscribe to a different method for each person. I have owned MARI since 1.08 when it was slipping on sand storm and share issue concerns. Also I have noticed over a longer length of time, some of the stocks with no trading, have huge ROIs.
146 2018-03-06 23:04:06 If that's a brand new Phormium you'll be waiting a while until it hits the shelves - whoever's growing it will have to build up stocks. Also expect to pay big bucks for it! 
147 2018-03-06 23:03:33 Good job. Bump stocks will make an AR-15 fire similar to Full-Auto, that is FACT. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against owning a firearm for SELF DEFENSE, but there is a line to be drawn between self defense and just being able to shoot a lot of people.

149 2018-03-06 23:03:17 Honestly, for the average investor who has no meaningful way to weigh one crypto against another, this could be a huge benefit.  

Regardless of the Bitcoin dominance, or the failure of some particular coin, this fund will likely still massively out perform stocks and equities.
150 2018-03-06 23:02:39 Come on @JerryBrownGov , we’re supposed to be the leader on a lot of these issues. Ban bump stocks. Ok net neutrality. You’re sleeping at the wheel!  Protect DACA dreamers. Ban assault style rifles. Do what other dem gov’s are doing in their state!
151 2018-03-06 23:02:32 When the criminals are arrested, social media stocks will crash and tweets will dwindle. Godspeed Justice.

158 2018-03-06 22:59:16 He knows that he did wrong when he cashed in on his steel/aluminum stocks just before Trump announced the tariffs.
159 2018-03-06 22:59:07 Stocks will for sure get slammed after #GaryCohn resignation

165 2018-03-06 22:56:19 You are such a lying sack of Kentucky horse shit! Companies are fleeing the country and buying back their stocks so board members can move our money offshore. Have you ever told the truth in your entire life?
166 2018-03-06 22:56:19 Prediction:

Stocks fall ~1.5% tomorrow on fresh fears of a Trump trade war.
167 2018-03-06 22:54:06 “bump stocks”...damned small keyboard screen!
168 2018-03-06 22:53:20 Will Ways and Means go ballistic on *anybody* in CronyLandia?

I'm shorting my stocks on that one ;)

172 2018-03-06 22:52:31 Perhaps Cohn can find a job in a boiler room selling penny stocks. He should have resigned months ago, or certainly after Charlottesville.
173 2018-03-06 22:51:43 once a month I check Urban Outfitters' website as if they'll suddenly have Sana's gray hoodie in stocks again
174 2018-03-06 22:50:57 To see how bad it will be for American stocks tomorrow - Austrailia opens at the top of the hour with Japan at 7:00pm and Hong Kong and Singapore at 8:00pm
175 2018-03-06 22:50:33 this is a big deal. most market savy guy quits. stocks will chuck an epic tariff tantrum now
176 2018-03-06 22:49:31 Good thing he dumped his aluminum stocks before the tariff was announced. Assuming we ever get to see his taxes.
177 2018-03-06 22:49:05 Ok - I seem to remember some governments have stinger missles, Apache helicopters, tanks ..... will the AR15s and bump stocks will be a match ? Just wondering

180 2018-03-06 22:48:35 #HSBA so weak at the moment - another Bearish Engulfing Candle today. 700p a psychological Support. Fundamentally it doesn't make a lot of sense  (but that's often how Stocks roll )
181 2018-03-06 22:48:28 ...and then stocks fall in AH trading
182 2018-03-06 22:48:23 The market is giving trump a vote of no confidence, or, the conspiracy is playing out to buy stocks back cheaper. International collusion.
183 2018-03-06 22:48:11 Well I hope Penn Social stocks up on potato vodka!
184 2018-03-06 22:47:36 He stayed long enough that his Goldman stock sale was tax free, but not long enough for his steel stocks to plummet.
185 2018-03-06 22:47:34 armed security guards go through background checks and do not carry AR-15s with bump stocks.
186 2018-03-06 22:47:34 Tremendous respect for Gary Cohn. When the President goes 180 degrees opposed to the advice of his advisor, the advisor shouldn't stay around.

Very bad news for the economy, however. Stocks probably at the high for the year before the tariffs.
187 2018-03-06 22:45:53 Apparently Gary Cohn didn't get them memo and wasn't able to dump his steel stocks fast enough.
188 2018-03-06 22:45:52 It's not - a fund always consists of MULTIPLE stocks (for two reasons. 1: Decrease risk by spreading investments. 2: to be able to mimic an index which would NEVER be possibe with just one stock.
189 2018-03-06 22:45:30 how does this impact the stocks ? is this going to trigger risk off ?
190 2018-03-06 22:45:24 European stocks rose on Tuesday as fears of a trade war and concerns over the Italian election continued to subside.
191 2018-03-06 22:43:49 FOX NEWS REPORTING GARY COHN TO RESIGN... STOCKS TANKING IN AFTERHOURS BIG TIME...
192 2018-03-06 22:43:34 The NRA invented bump stocks, had them manufactured, and then hand delivered them to the Vegas shooter. 
193 2018-03-06 22:43:27 US stocks ended mostly higher on Tuesday in choppy trade as an apparent diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea provided support, while uncertainty over proposed tariffs and potential retaliation from trading partners kept bubbling along.
194 2018-03-06 22:42:46 Actually damn you might be right, NorCal I could argue, but most of these regions I could only argue if they had a good day and their best players would both take at least 3 stocks of Leffen and Armada. Android, Daydee and Johnny could still clean up.

196 2018-03-06 22:42:09 "An index fund is a portfolio of stocks or bonds that is designed to mimic the performance of a market index."

"Market index" = merely "crypto market cap" in this case.
197 2018-03-06 22:41:41 I go back to the early-to-mid sixties and watch as much John Coltrane as humanely possible. I also pick up a stupid amount of jazz vinyl and save it for later (maybe some stocks for financial freedom), so I can just listen to music for days upon days of  truly great music in 2018

202 2018-03-06 22:40:11 Bad news for the #StockMarket - per The NY Times Gary Cohn the top #economic adviser to @realDonaldTrump is resigning - IMO because of his disagreement with POTUS #tariffs which Goldman Sachs has called archaic #Stocks #markets #Dow #DJIA #NASDAQ #SP500
203 2018-03-06 22:40:04 RIP stocks Wednesday morning
204 2018-03-06 22:39:53 Moustache stocks skyrocket
205 2018-03-06 22:39:39 I'll do that. I much prefer arguing in person. And I guess my whole thing is stop asking and start doing to some of these guys. But they weren't raised like I was so I need to look at it different. We built cars and busted ass just to race hobby stocks.
206 2018-03-06 22:39:25 I get the feeling that those who think by not turning in there bump stocks Trump will come to there aid and let them keep them but in this country you don't always get what you want so those who think there above the law best think again they will catch up with them.
207 2018-03-06 22:38:56 So this is all after he dumped those steel/aluminum stocks, made bajillions and is now quitting? Doesn’t excuse inside trading SEC suspicions.
208 2018-03-06 22:38:40 Stocks falling on Cohn news $AMZN $NFLX
209 2018-03-06 22:38:33 Guess Trump didn't give him advance warning like he did Carl Icahn 
He didn't get to sell off his steel, aluminum and auto stocks.
210 2018-03-06 22:38:19 I think they're better now plus we have QE and we have more debt which is awesome for when they want to transfer a few billion or a lot of billion into stocks. Was the bond market rigged in 88?
211 2018-03-06 22:37:22 Nah I might be a simpul farmer, but the only stocks I cares about is CORN STOCKS. Yessir yeeehawr. #corn #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #nasdaq #morecorn
212 2018-03-06 22:36:37 You have been saying the same thing for 20 years. You could have had bump stocks banned a week after Vegas shooting but you had to add your wish list to the legislation. The NRA members has killed less than Democrats, maybe we ban them
213 2018-03-06 22:36:30 Cramer causes the illegal pumping and dumping of stocks everyday.
214 2018-03-06 22:36:11 I think we’ll be fine. If we avoid defeat against Leeds and Villa we then have two home games v Reading and Burton.
215 2018-03-06 22:35:47 "An index fund is a portfolio of stocks or bonds that is designed to mimic the performance of a market index."
216 2018-03-06 22:35:38 The PPT has been around since 1988, if I recall since then we have had a least two 50% falls since then & a few 20% falls. Even though the market is broken we can still #crash further from here. #SPX #stocks
217 2018-03-06 22:35:29 $BPMX, if anyone is into stocks, been in since .13. Been tweeting about it since then as well :)
218 2018-03-06 22:35:29 So, is Gary Cohn's just-announced resignation going to become the narrative and sole reason for the inevitable big crash???

220 2018-03-06 22:34:32 Those stocks are off the charts now.

230 2018-03-06 22:30:02 Do me a huge favor. Try to push for a change in the language of gun control. Instead of talking about assault weapons, talk about banning weapons designed for area targets as opposed to point. Semi-automatics are for point. Bump stocks make them for area. Would be easy compromise
231 2018-03-06 22:29:41 I haven't heard a single GOP come out FOR keeping bump stocks legal.  Is Rubio pro-bump stocks?

234 2018-03-06 22:28:29 Criminals won’t follow any laws. They’ll get around any law, that’s why they are criminals. Build a new lock and the first person to buy one would be a burglar , you know what I mean and I concede on the bump stocks
235 2018-03-06 22:28:08 Bump stocks are kinda stupid. I could get on board with a bump-stock ban if:

1. I thought the left was negotiating in good faith and wouldn't 'take a mile'. 

2. Bump-stock weren't a super rudimentary device you could easily make in your garage.
236 2018-03-06 22:27:40 Lol stocks fallen
237 2018-03-06 22:26:03 @karenfinerman please tell your show to stop talking about Crypto all the time!!!  Are there stocks of companies with real earning to talk about? Or should we all buy coins that grow inside computers in an unpredictable fashion?
238 2018-03-06 22:24:30 But go ahead and sign the ban on bump stocks. It won’t do any good. If people want to do harm, they will.

240 2018-03-06 22:24:20 @GovInslee signs SB 5992, banning bump stocks-makes manufacturing/selling illegal July 2018, illegal to own/possess July 2019 - also includes buy back program that gives people surrendering bump stocks $150 #waleg
241 2018-03-06 22:24:11 At one point before BTC, I’d have been happy to take 20%-30% profit in 4 years with online stocks/shares/funds. With Bitcoin, everyone (incl. me) somehow expects to take 130% profit in 4 mths. Good that this stagnation period is teaching the nascent market some patience.
242 2018-03-06 22:23:58 And if he rescinds the tariffs would Icahn lose money as stocks he sold could increase in value? Oh we are stuck with these tariffs.  He will only screw over Icahn for Putin.
243 2018-03-06 22:23:53 @MelissaLeeCNBC Are you seriously going to cover Crypto more than stocks?  It's a highly speculative investment that could arguably be hogwash.  Where is your integrity as a journalist?  This is like telling people to buy penny stocks....
244 2018-03-06 22:23:37 Agree. At one point before BTC, I’d have been happy to take 20%-30% profit in 4 years with online stocks/shares/funds.

245 2018-03-06 22:23:01 Let’s start by making bump stocks illegal. Let’s make background checks Universal. And, then, let’s vote out ever Pol who take blood money from the NRA. No Civilian needs an AR, and no Civilian needs a 30 round magazine. Especially an 18 yr. old male with a testosterone of 2500.

247 2018-03-06 22:22:57 @KenXyro just a reminder that February of 2018 never happened and it’s now call the Void Month. This is because of the meme stocks were at an all time low
248 2018-03-06 22:22:12 Okay, stocks, fine--do we have any reliable information (meaning not biased toward company profits) what these tariffs will do to jobs?

The problem is always always always the rich/executives/stock holders taking too much in profits. THAT is what we must limit.
249 2018-03-06 22:20:50 But then, Trump said bump stocks were gone too.  He’s a hopeless liar.
250 2018-03-06 22:20:24 Ahaha
251 2018-03-06 22:20:13 She needs high-capacity assault weapons and bump stocks to protect her children from the zombie apocalypse. Considering the level of "debate" by the @NRA, the @GOP, and @realDonaldTrump, we're in the middle of one as we speak.

255 2018-03-06 22:17:29 The entire UK fishing industry accounts for less than .1% of GDP. Not only that, but the fish we catch in our waters aren't the fish we generally eat, so taking control of our fish stocks will be a hollow victory anyway.

317 2018-03-06 21:50:13 These are not stocks. There is actually only one proper blockchain. The stocks you're referring to will be layer 2 applications built on top of BTC. BTC is the internet. Today you can buy and hold the internet in 1994. I sometimes think you miss why BTC has value

332 2018-03-06 21:44:46 It is something. Again that is all I am saying. It might not matter and be  changed back. There had to be trial and error too. 

As for the feel-good thing... like the ban on bump stocks? Yeah that solves tons doesn’t it? That was a feel good proposal.

335 2018-03-06 21:43:34 Smith votes with the Dino’s but pretends to be a progressive. If she answers no questions then she is not on the hooks for her positions. She also has not filed a financial report. One can only guess it is due to hefty investments in  stocks that  a progressive would not own.

340 2018-03-06 21:42:18 The correct answer is strict gun laws, nation wide, and no reason for anyone to have assult wepons of any type. Use gun in a crime, 20 years no parole.

344 2018-03-06 21:41:26 I'm sorry Eileen, but u are using the wrong terms for weapons. No "automatic weapons" have been used in Mass murders. In Las Vegas for example, a "bump stock" was added to simulate automatic fire (machine gun) on a semi automatic rifle. I have no prob banning these bump stocks.

348 2018-03-06 21:40:35 Stocks are resilient here. Gold & miners appear bottomed out and going up so may be leading markets higher too.
349 2018-03-06 21:40:24 They dont imo. But there are stocks that are leaders. So if the market is down and a stock like $AAPL goes red to green that may give confidence to traders the market may turn and its ok to buy into the other tech stocks.

363 2018-03-06 21:32:33 It’s a fake quote, so the point is moot, but I want to address your assertion. In the state of nature, anything you can do is a right. I think you mean ownership of bump stocks is not a Constitutionally protected right.

366 2018-03-06 21:31:25 I am becoming more convinced that it is not "too late" for crypto, it actually may be too early (for any definitive long term investing).

The question I think about each day is:

If it were 1994 - how would I know what internet stocks to buy? How would I know what to hold?
367 2018-03-06 21:31:23 No, he's protecting his fat cat friends who own millions in steel stocks.
368 2018-03-06 21:31:17 I think the problem is that profits are the deciding factor. Cutting jobs to raise stocks( not to stay in business, but to deliver a profit to share holders) doesn't sit well. The system itself is corrupt.
369 2018-03-06 21:30:30 'If nothing else, you can reassure yourself you’re not the only sane person still using outdated and onerous technology..' It's ok thanks, the current film community, mass production of film and new film stocks being introduced already do that for me.
370 2018-03-06 21:30:20 pot stocks are pretty much as volatile as crypto. might want to go with stocks since they have better liquidity.
371 2018-03-06 21:30:04 World stocks edge higher: US +.3%; Europe +.1%. Markets trying to balance 15% rise in corporate profits versus trade war fears. Even though the latter are easing, given Trump's unpredictability they are still an important consideration

386 2018-03-06 21:22:27 @seanhannity I keep waiting on followup on what the president said about gun control, raising the age, EO to do away with bump stocks..  He hasn't said a thing and neither is much of talk radio.  Did he cave?  Was he playing someone?

389 2018-03-06 21:21:49 NRA is for the ban. He had bump stocks on 12 of his 23 weapons. Do you seriously think he could have fired that many shots that fast and for that long without such a device?

407 2018-03-06 21:16:58 Bullish case for stocks is that steel tariffs ended up being a much less bearish case for stocks
408 2018-03-06 21:16:17 US stocks end the session with gains. Nasdaq leads the way.  Nasdaq up 0.56% leads the way
The US major stock indices are closing up on the day with the tech heavy Nasdaq leading the way higher.
Chips stocks did well today:
409 2018-03-06 21:16:08 US stocks closed moderately higher on the day: $DJIA +9, $SPX +7
410 2018-03-06 21:15:58 US stocks closed moderately higher on the day: $DJIA +9, $SPX +7
411 2018-03-06 21:15:57 I disagree. Knowing the results means you know how it ends only. You still don't know what they did to get to that point. The person who wins could be down 2 stocks on their last stock of last game and you're just thinking "how the hell do they pull this off"
412 2018-03-06 21:15:33 The fact that the NRA is so resistant just on bump stocks alone is what riles me so much about that organization. There's no coherent reason for this. They should be leading that charge.
413 2018-03-06 21:14:47 And yes, someone can certainly switch out magazines fast, but combined with a ban on bump stocks, their capacity for destruction is more limited and this means fewer will die.
414 2018-03-06 21:14:00 American companies have already announced $178 billion in stock buybacks in 2018. How will this “trickle-down” to workers when 84 percent of all stocks are owned by the top 10 percent of American households?

422 2018-03-06 21:10:29 Why not make it more difficult to get them. Increase penalties for straw purchasers, ban bump stocks, allow police to temporarily remove guns from people deemed dangerous to themselves and others till they're cleared? That's what law enforcement wants.

427 2018-03-06 21:08:13 2 options:

1. #Respect the #IranDeal -> build #trust w Iranians -> make more deals -> Iranians deal w/ their govt -> peace.

2. Disregard the #IranDeal -> lose trust of Iranians -> tension -> #war -> #extremism -> terrorism. 

Choose 2 if you have defense/military stocks.
428 2018-03-06 21:07:42 Overall outlook on the market: it looks promising as there ARE actually plays with stocks making big moves.  Just volume still way too light to be going in with big size for a #FiveFigureClub invitation.  No day 2 washout longs either.  But it's better than nothing for now.
429 2018-03-06 21:07:39 Thanks for this. I have not, however I did set aside money specifically to play around with individual stocks/funds that aren't tied to a retirement account. I have Vanguard now, so will def look into the IRA options. Particularly the Roth...which makes me wanna say RAWSE.

466 2018-03-06 20:52:45 #stocks  Here a helpful tip when looking for value stocks for your portfolio. Don't even consider a stock without enough free cash flow to cover its long-term debt over a ten year period--no longer. Yes,a strict standard, but you won't be sorry for this precaution.
467 2018-03-06 20:51:14 Meanwhile in Washington State our Governor Inslee signed a bill banning bump stocks today.  Kids and all are 1 step safer.
468 2018-03-06 20:50:51 @thejadedtrader Hi JT, we have a group discussion going on regarding a lot of stocks that you’re following. Thought i would extend the invite. Follow me back if interested.
469 2018-03-06 20:50:51 You president promised an EO on bump stocks....You've done nothing,,,Promises Made and Not Kept
470 2018-03-06 20:50:41 I don’t believe we, as civilians need bump stocks or any kind of conversion mechanism to make a rifle an automatic and I really disagree with high capacity mags. I was taught if you can’t make the shot with the first pull of a trigger then maybe you shouldn’t be shooting at all.
471 2018-03-06 20:50:23 Why did trump's buddy unload steel stocks days before his steel tariffs?  Insider trading.
472 2018-03-06 20:49:55 Only mining and daytrading normally. Long term shouldn't be a problem, just as normal stocks.
473 2018-03-06 20:49:32 OK Mr. Rubio, No Bump Stocks, no high capacity magazines over 15 rounds, must be 21 to buy any gun, must wait 7 days for the purchase of any gun and no more military assault rifles. Problem solved, second amendment still in place. Now we just need you to enact it.
474 2018-03-06 20:49:17 HOW LONG CAN THEY HONESTLY PROP STOCKS???
475 2018-03-06 20:48:24 Not gun grab, restriction on military style weapons, Armilte type, AR15, AK47, with large clips of ammo. Not hunting, not sporting, not defense weapons. Bump stocks to be made illegal, yes. If stolen guns are not reported, perhaps a law for stolen guns to be reported.

485 2018-03-06 20:47:00 I disagree on bump stocks because I haven't used one and the fact the Vegas shooter did probably saved lives (less accurate=less murder @ that distance).

503 2018-03-06 20:38:31 I don’t have a SSN, nor do I want to trade on margin, nor do I want a broker. I’m an individual investor who wants to trade in US stocks. Anyone familiar with an authentic trading platform that is welcoming?
504 2018-03-06 20:38:08 The 15 months or so that I've owned this stock, that seems to be what it does.  I honestly think the nickel spread nonsense they implemented for some stocks causes that pattern.  But who knows.
505 2018-03-06 20:37:58 Another thing is that, if your opp chooses to play really passively or stare you back, literally just time them out. Sometimes the best way to win isn't by taking two stocks, but just by simply not losing. I literally lost count of how many ppl ive timed out

510 2018-03-06 20:36:32 "Most of those disclosure statements also said that the writers did not own shares in any of the companies."  I guess fake people can't buy stocks so they might be telling the truth on that one lol

512 2018-03-06 20:35:42 Please tell me how having a bump stock is an inalienable right.  Tell me how trying to get around the full auto ban is a part of the 2A.  and yes, I know bump stocks don't give you a full auto gun.  However they do come close, at the expense of accuracy.
513 2018-03-06 20:35:14 Stocks down FOX Business belidves it's because UHC will be dropping the cost of prescriptions to plan participants.
514 2018-03-06 20:35:05 Steel industry has doubled in 30 years.  US steel is 70% of the steel trade in the US.  Steel stocks boomed in 2017.  What the hell makes you think the steel industry needs relief?
515 2018-03-06 20:34:03 Its all about buying the blue chip stocks during the dips.
516 2018-03-06 20:33:35 I am going to make a bold prediction. Trump’s attempt to raise tariffs on steel is a ruse. He only did that to help Carl Icahn
make a crap load of money by dumping his steel stocks 2 weeks before the announcement. Carl will reward him handsomely after he loses in 2020.

518 2018-03-06 20:32:14 Ok so I’ll grant you that in vegas penetration may have mattered but the real factor there was bump stocks.  And that shooting was unusual because of the range that required a rifle.  I don’t think school doors are highly rated for penetration but I’ll look into that one.

528 2018-03-06 20:23:21 Bump stocks must be banned. Period. Personally, I don’t see the need for semi-automatic rifles—as they are useless for hunting for food or for trophies as they destroy the meat/pelts—and as far a personal protection goes you can’t pack them or put them in a bedside table.

564 2018-03-06 20:06:21 You probably shouldn’t buy stocks. It’s not a good investment strategy since you can’t possibly do the due diligence you need. Invest in a low cost etf or index fund using questrade or a different low cost brokerage. Get your fees to under 1% to maximize your returns
565 2018-03-06 20:05:34 PhRMA is a powerful lobby so it will be difficult, but their companies should be made non-profit & unable to sell stocks, which now makes them beholden to shareholders, not patients.

576 2018-03-06 20:00:48 If I were to judge the market by the way individual stocks are behaving, I would say this market has bottomed.

637 2018-03-06 19:29:40 BOYCOTTING IS THE WAY TO GO. MAKE A LISTS OF COMPANIES THAT SUPPORT SYSTEMIC HATRED AND BOYCOTT THEM ALL. THEIR STOCKS WON'T GROW OFF WE STOP SHOPPING. THIS IS A REVOLUTION.
638 2018-03-06 19:29:31 Ethos wallet will have a fiat gateway as well. They want to join traditional asset (stocks, commod...etc) with crypto. Platform for building financial products. Debit card in the future.
639 2018-03-06 19:29:13 Teens: Let's try fewer guns and make them less apt for mass-murders.
GOP/NRA: How about more guns?
Teens: Ban bump-stocks & cranks? Universal background checks for ALL transfers & sales?
GOP/NRA: No.
Teens: Look we want not to die!
GOP/NRA: You're too young to know what you want.
640 2018-03-06 19:29:01 The weapon type, the extended magazine, specifically Vegas - the bump stocks. Other people will go after the rest, I want better control of weapons & accessories I believe have no place in the hands of the public.
641 2018-03-06 19:28:41 At midday, Mortgage Bond prices lower. Stocks push back into positive territory. 10-yr yield 2.88%.
642 2018-03-06 19:28:35 Uncertainty surrounding the tariffs pushes Stocks lower.
643 2018-03-06 19:28:34 President Trump says trade tariffs will take place. Stocks now negative. Dow -130 points.

645 2018-03-06 19:28:00 He began announcing the trade war/tariff business to allow his friend Carl Icon to sell (steel) stocks, BEFORE the announcement and "stock drop." Supposedly Icon made a killing.  Trump likely benefited from it himself.  Let's see if the trade war/tariff happens.
646 2018-03-06 19:26:41 @timrinehart our country against gun violence. Florida State Senate narrowly passed a bill Monday that would raise the age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 and  require a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases and ban the sale or possession of bump fire stocks, which can
647 2018-03-06 19:26:37 Time to buy more stocks 
648 2018-03-06 19:25:04 I don't think it's pure speculation (known associate of trump dumps steel stocks a few days before tariff mentioned) and you can't confirm without asking a question so I think they're within their right as a reporter to ask to determine if a story exists.
649 2018-03-06 19:24:55 You can max out both your 2017 and 2018 IRAs until 2017 taxes are due. So that's 11K you can 'dump' into the market. I really like vanguard funds that follow the market (like VOO or VTI). They are safer than just buying a stock of a company cus there are 100s of stocks in a fund.

652 2018-03-06 19:23:21 Lee, I think you know full well that killings of this scale simply wouldn't happen with revolvers; the ammo capacity and reload times make it near-impossible. 
There is a reason that semi-automatic rifles, high-cap mags and bump stocks are the tools of choice for mass shooters.
653 2018-03-06 19:22:46 They aren’t protecting 2A. They are protecting the NRA’s ability to scare people into purchasing  semi automatic weapons, buttloads if ammo and bump stocks. Nobody wants your hunting rifle and handguns are another discussion all together.
654 2018-03-06 19:19:31 Wonder if any of his family/friends have been profiting from insider trading on metal stocks since his "surprise" tariff announcement?

663 2018-03-06 19:16:41 It is all about creating more risk in the system as even after Dodd Frank and Volcker rule big banks are  delivering services only to mega rich corporates or to buying Treasuries to keep yields low or providing easy money to keep stocks high.

675 2018-03-06 19:09:02 Guess you also don’t realize that tariffs are paid by country importing the goods. Therefore would add that increased cost onto price of goods & consumers pay more. Why do you think Stocks went down & Republicans in Congress are firmly against? Harms businesses in their States.

678 2018-03-06 19:06:10 Why would someone have to lose money to be salty about the current state of crypto “trading”?  People are forcing crypto to be something it is not by thinking that it works like traditional stocks. Tether and this new competitor are examples of this failed ideology.

740 2018-03-06 18:45:21 the news is good. just need to see if it finishes strong today. If strong finish, it could run tomorrow but no strong finish and it will probably fade just like all stocks after you get a PR. The news is actually great. Just not a good reaction to the news
741 2018-03-06 18:45:09 strange that the MSCI ACWI ex Fossil Fuels Index touted by this author invests 53% in US, largely in FAANG stocks. Just buy the S&P and get comparable performance!
742 2018-03-06 18:44:19 Republican Sen. John Bonacic tells me on an interview a ban on bump stocks makes sense. He would also suppprt extending period for background checks and making it harder for dangerously mentally ill to have a firearm.

744 2018-03-06 18:43:48 @PDavidsonusat what a disingenuous nit wit...to say after Trump tariff announcement stocks plunged because of worry foreign manufacturers would raise prices is embarrassing. In case you didn't notice.. stocks quickly rebounded..

755 2018-03-06 18:38:05 Without reading let me guess - tech stocks? Plus, they have only 5 million people so less of public spending. :)
756 2018-03-06 18:37:54 Stopped out means it triggers your stop loss. These stocks can swing 10% up and down in a day. So there could be a short term dip down 10% which triggers your sell order and then the stock bounces back up

836 2018-03-06 18:24:57 Sen.McConnell, it appears that you're ignoring the current state of banking and securities corruption which persists in this administration. Recently, a Trump advisor-sold $31.3 million in steel-related stocks just prior to the tariff announcement.  Need to keep the regulations.

838 2018-03-06 18:24:45 Big investors predict gun stocks are going nose-dive, so their getting out now. You're floating an idea to buy companies close to full price and dramatically cut profits, driving prices even lower. If you don't buy at the bottom, you're paying off death merchants.

848 2018-03-06 18:19:16 Highly doubt the announcement of tariffs had anything to do with the stock sell off, so it is a little strange to see the lift based on possible tariff changes.

957 2018-03-06 17:59:33 but there are no bad stocks, only bad trades xD
958 2018-03-06 17:58:28 In fairness the entire UK population should be awarded this prize for voting in the referendum irrelevant of how they voted. Those that exploited this lack of education should be awarded a go in the stocks and a Treason conviction.

966 2018-03-06 17:54:31 Amazed that the NRA is pursuing a self-destructive corporate strategy. Threatening ads alienate people who want only: 1.) no more assault weapons, 2.) thorough background checks at gun shows and 3.) no more bump stocks. NRA’s greed is trumping rationality.
967 2018-03-06 17:54:19 You should get in touch with Trump , and convince him to turn into Gab

969 2018-03-06 17:53:45 The Netherlands. Less than 1% tax on stocks, bonds & crypto.

Otherwise 40% tax
970 2018-03-06 17:53:25 There is much to debate. But first ban assault rifles, ban semi auto weapons. ban large magazines. Ban bump stocks. Fix the background checks, and if someone does pass it, run another back ground check and require testing on the gun and person ever 3 months.

974 2018-03-06 17:52:10 We no plans to offer penny stocks on Stash at this time. Our investment committee meets regularly and reviews the investments on our platform as well as those that might be suitable to add to Stash. We’ll be sure to let our investors know when new ones are added or in the works!
975 2018-03-06 17:51:51 What about pre-school? Head Start? Are we going to let those innocents go without armed protection?

Has anybody checked recently to see if Drumpf or cronies has recently began investing heavily in security service stocks? Pinkerton? Burns? 

There has to be a monetary reason!

980 2018-03-06 17:51:00 Major reason #stocks likely to continue more choppy--beyond just #ComputerTrading moves up & down on individual days--than in #Trump's first yea is fact #Fed is withdrawing its continuing subsidy from #StockMarket/#FinancialSystem.
981 2018-03-06 17:50:15 The bearish case for stocks right now is how long I am...
982 2018-03-06 17:50:11 Very excited about the positions I’ve built up in some great looking stocks for the future.#CASP - high impact drill campaign looking for over 20,000bopd in 18-24months. #ARS - edging towards Bkm project build bringing copper production to the company . #EVRH #VIM #AEG #SML also
983 2018-03-06 17:50:10 I ask these questions, because I really want to know what the hell you bears are looking at. I see uptrends in stocks, healthy sector rotation and zero stress in credit markets.
984 2018-03-06 17:50:06 Hola, cuando la encargué ponía que los stocks se renovaban el 1 de marzo, y te dejaba reservarla a este precio. A día de hoy no hay nuevas noticias, por lo menos no la han cobrado. Si la encargásteis, ¿vosotros sabéis algo nuevo?@XavierMinguella @Rubenkeke @luisfgranada
985 2018-03-06 17:50:02 Helen, I really was referring to the people that would have to commute in and out, just making a comment having been in those areas and dealing with commuter traffic.  I see stocks are up and having a great day.  Hope your having a great day too!

989 2018-03-06 17:48:08 I am also wondering about your ichimoku settings. I'm not here to educate or anything, because I know you are an excellent trader and you have your own style. But 20,60,12,30 ichi settings are better for crypto, because it's 24/7. Yours are better for stocks.
990 2018-03-06 17:47:53 People with stocks can protect themselves with options.
991 2018-03-06 17:47:32 I think there is a lot of things to break first in order qualify a sell off as a calamity. It's easy to make calls like that. Everyday you wake up and have a 50/50 chance of being right. I own no stocks, so will trade whatever I get.
992 2018-03-06 17:47:14 I think it’s impossible to predict  - but the bear position is: stocks are at historically high valuations, those valuations have been created by an accommodative monetary policy, and all of that accommodation is ending now as the Fed tries to shrink the balance sheet.
993 2018-03-06 17:46:54 Not nifty, i am willing to buy good stocks but waiting for correction to get over

996 2018-03-06 17:46:13 @JohnKingCNN the only reason @tillerson_w is still in Office is he’s waiting for the one year mark to avoid paying taxes on his stocks. Typical repo way
997 2018-03-06 17:44:45 Ya, like he did to our Military Families/U.S Base on Qatar, cause Jared didn't get his damned loan. Or inside Trading when he told Carl Icahn to Dump his steel stocks before he announced a Trade war on steel! Or how he's protecting us "NOT" from Russia! Crazy old Bat!
998 2018-03-06 17:44:07 Stocks don't go mid to high 90's and not go over 100. It's a rule. $bpmc

1007 2018-03-06 17:41:14 I see stocks breaking out from consolidations, not breaking down from massive tops. What do you see?
1008 2018-03-06 17:40:59 Probably; most cardholder agreements allow banks to place restrictions on activity. Generally, it's applied to scams, illegal activity, sanctioned countries, etc... but you can't buy traditional stocks with a credit card either (which is the analogy they're going with here).

1014 2018-03-06 17:38:19 Sorry deleted my response, wish Twitter had an edit button. But IMO a handful of smaller measures such as basic vetting of potential gun purchasers, banning bump stocks, reducing clip sizes, tougher to legally sell guns at shows / online, it’d add up to a worthwhile difference
1015 2018-03-06 17:38:11 Didn’t he lose money if he sold before the announcement? Steel stocks increased after announcing didn’t they?
1016 2018-03-06 17:37:19 Remember when U.S. #stocks used to move wildly on weekly M2 money supply figures (OK, Im OLD)? No one cares anymore. Oh. Some (not much) sense to it, since #Fed was apparently paying attention too those figures.

1106 2018-03-06 17:22:42 1. Not fully invested - Stagger your purchases and invest when you see value in quality stocks over say next 6 months.
2. Those fully invested - try to raise cash from lower quality stocks, then follow step 1.
1st cat should do step 2 as well to improve quality of existing port.

1109 2018-03-06 17:20:58 It’s hard to trade stocks with tariffs hanging over your thoughts. @realDonaldTrump is this the art of negotiation?
1110 2018-03-06 17:20:49 @APPropst what consequences can these “risky” stocks have in the future? Would this result in a crash in the investment sector?
1111 2018-03-06 17:20:11 This happens fairly regularly in stock markets too. Penny stocks pump 300% because they have similar tickers to trending companies. 

Which isn’t to say that we’re not in a bubble... it’s far just less remarkable than the sustained market caps of coins like doge & btg
1112 2018-03-06 17:19:31 Patty, thanks for leading in this important area! We need sensible laws while still allowing responsible people still posses firearms. Bump stocks should be banned and the age limit for possessing a firearm raised to 21. Washington state still has too many gun deaths too.

1124 2018-03-06 17:16:14 Congress is planning to gut the Dodd/Frank Wall Street reform law that’s was passed after the 2008 crash. With help of some democrats. 

It’s kinda like they want another crash. It would harm everyone in the short term but benefit the youth in the long term as stocks rebound
1125 2018-03-06 17:14:52 We limit everything with laws so we can all live together in society. The fear of bump stocks and AR-15s comes from recent killings. It’s not an unfounded fear.
1126 2018-03-06 17:14:09 Realmente han existido huelgas a la japonesa, pero la intencion de las mismas no se entiende como "trabajar más" sino  más bien el crear un desajuste en la producción provocando un aumento de stocks (con bajadas de precios al consumo) y agotando las 1/2
1127 2018-03-06 17:14:07 Senators, Congressmen - voters are really pissed! Stop accepting NRA donations. You work for US! not them! No silencers, no bump stocks, no super shooter magazines, no cop killer rounds. And comprehensive background checks ... but NO countrywide reciprocal concealed carry!!!!
1128 2018-03-06 17:13:51 Mandatory safety training should be included along with better background checks to include juvenile (otherwise closed) records. Automatic and Semi-automatic and "bump stocks" (whatever those are) should be banned except for law enforcement and active military.

1144 2018-03-06 17:10:11 My advice? Keep a close eye on Trump's cronies. My bet is they will start buying steel-related stocks at knock-down prices, just before he abandons or reverses the planned tariffs, and trouser a nice profit.
1145 2018-03-06 17:10:07 Kazakh grain stocks remain historical high. As at 01/02/2018, they estimated at 14,208 TMT, 1,089 TMT or 8.3% above last year. This is record high since at least 2013.

The question is why?  Pretty soon our elected officials will be asking themselves the same.

1293 2018-03-06 16:29:21 So far all the mentioned names and the $SPX are unable to trade through their 50d MAs. So a pullback here is logical. Unless the hot stocks show some real bearish signs i.e. failed breakouts and reversal,  a continuation of the rally is likely.

1295 2018-03-06 16:29:02 It isn't a ban of "assault weapons" as those weapons were already banned in 1934.  What the media keeps calling "assault weapons" are just rifles with scary looking cosmetic features, such as folding stocks and pistol grips.

1307 2018-03-06 16:21:28 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1308 2018-03-06 16:21:27 #NOW: Florida House is discussing SB 7026 (Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS Public Safety Act). Bill raises age to purchase guns to 21, bans bump stocks, gives $67 million for school marshal program allowing staff to carry firearms, etc. Does not include weapons ban. @mysuncoast

1311 2018-03-06 16:21:04 The legislation will prohibit the possession, manufacture, transport, shipment and sale of bump stocks – the devices used in the Las Vegas shooting that turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns.
1312 2018-03-06 16:20:11 Probably not, that's why he wants to ban bump stocks. He has no idea what a bump stock even is.
1313 2018-03-06 16:20:08 It will enact the Domestic Violence Escalation Prevention Act to protect individuals and families. And it will ban bump stocks and similar devices.
1314 2018-03-06 16:20:01 Soft red winter wheat producers have to be concerned with the ability of this market to hold. Their stocks look to grow again this year with rains falling over the Midwest and South. Very different story from hard red winter wheat belt.
1315 2018-03-06 16:19:48 Speaker says the Assembly will vote on legislation this afternoon that would help prevent gun violence. He says the legislation would keep guns out of dangerous hands, focus on mental health services and ban bump stocks
1316 2018-03-06 16:19:09 The majority of gun owners don’t have bump stocks I suspect. Not actually an improvement to the weapon and a waste of ammo for an expert.

#WhatActuallyMakesMeLOL
1324 2018-03-06 16:17:09 Changing the age from 18 to 21 to buy guns in Florida was the wrong decision. Banking Bump stocks was. Good decision. But if you can server your country at 17,18 and can’t buy a gun, even if the person is good, then that’s a problem

1327 2018-03-06 16:15:58 The most acceptable firearm, in my opinion, since I am no fan of hunting, is none at all. But hey - this is America. My fellow countrymen won't give up their guns. So at least maybe we can ban assault rifles, bump stocks, little things like that.
1328 2018-03-06 16:15:36 Some of the best stocks to find are ones with an exhausted shareholder base and a near term catalyst.
1329 2018-03-06 16:15:35 NRA supports the ban of bump stocks and trigger cranks.

NRA supports taking guns from those who make dangerous threats.

NRA supports serious gun safety training.

Yes the NRA wants an armed populice because that's the entire point of the 2nd Amendment!
1330 2018-03-06 16:15:22 Mans just wanna make the stocks fall so they can rise up
1331 2018-03-06 16:14:41 agreed, and this is why I don’t think bending bump stocks would be anything other than a stopgap measure, and I wouldn’t be surprised if gun manufacturers already have an alternative ready for sale that would do effectively the exact same thing.

1338 2018-03-06 16:12:30 Automatic conversions are illegal. Hence, bump stocks that use the recoil as a type of forward assist to speed up trigger pulls and simulate automatic fire.

You could do the same thing with a rubber band.

1340 2018-03-06 16:11:00 While @realDonaldTrump sits on his hands not doing anything about #GunControl, bump stocks are still being sold to make the AR-15 an automatic weapon. #NRABloodOnYourHands

1347 2018-03-06 16:08:21 Yeah, right. You don’t want taxes to pay for anything, but you assume people will help each other. Reminds me of how the tax cuts are supposed to benefit the middle/working classes but companies used their break to buy their own stocks, not to give raises or hire more people.

1382 2018-03-06 15:54:17 There’s a lot of stocks like that...the problem is that when the capital markets turn & people stop funding badly run, cash-burning story stocks then we won’t be able to get the borrow!
1383 2018-03-06 15:53:33 ..., there's also other solutions besides confiscation. One would be legalization, since most estimates are that half of the total homicides are drug-related. Then there can be relative gun restraining orders, banning bump stocks, etc.

1517 2018-03-06 15:02:15 Bhai why extra taxes at all? Does the tax or cess go down when prices move up? Why not just announce MIEQ exports. If millers expory say 8%-10% of their stocks, the losses can be offset by gains in the balance

1519 2018-03-06 15:01:06 We have an example of what it did with low volume and that was still a great experience. Would it be better if I could have sold all when I wanted to, yes, but that only slightly decreased a HUGE profit

1529 2018-03-06 14:56:06 It seems now the risk is off. Stocks rallied sharply yesterday and the bullish exuberance has followed-through to the start of today’s session with the EU markets higher and US index futures increasing their gains further. Nikkei up 1.8%, Stoxx 600 up 0.8%, Dow up 1.4%.
1530 2018-03-06 14:55:36 The real conversation is about more than bump stocks, would you care to join it?
1531 2018-03-06 14:55:26 The opportunity to make a profit is indeed identifying those stocks that are undervalued or overvalued. Certainly there is a range of outcomes, but the market often gets these predicted outcomes completely wrong. Think Enron, Bear Stearns an Kristen Creme for example
1532 2018-03-06 14:54:20 All these CEOs that usually get rewarded for selling their company below intrinsic value should be going to jail. Where are the politicians and the sec? Working at private equity cashing in on your stocks during off years. Jail for Buffett.

1534 2018-03-06 14:53:21 SVU on USA: 'Stocks & Bondage' - Benson and Stabler investigate a successful woman's suspicious death and find themselves in the world of sadomasochism.
1535 2018-03-06 14:53:16 Sure feels like the media is getting played.  What about the bump stocks Trump said "don't worry, I'll take care of that myself".  What about the mass shooting/NRA?  What about the UNTOUCHED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS set aside to investigate Russian interference?
1536 2018-03-06 14:52:49 Trump said on msnbc that he's making a separate executive order to ban bump stocks. Question is, will he actually follow through? I hope so.

1543 2018-03-06 14:50:19 I remember you saying you studied finance, how knowledge are you on Roth IRA and investing in stocks/bonds through a current 401k plan?
1544 2018-03-06 14:50:06 No one thing is ever a definitive sign to either bail on stocks or be bullish. If it were that easy, someone, somewhere, would have discovered the trick and be the richest guy in the world.
1545 2018-03-06 14:49:43 That's the key and then it would be time to reconsider the case for investment.  Needs something concrete so that people can calculate a PE that compares well with other good AIM stocks

1549 2018-03-06 14:47:27 @davidhogg111 Your failure to condemn Scott Israel and the four deputies who were derelict in their duty and then attack Dana Loesch is inexcusable. And bump stocks ARE allowed at NRA ranges. Your claim that Dana doesn't care about kids is wrong. You are irresponsible. Deluded.

1555 2018-03-06 14:45:16 Yeah, just like If you have to check the value of your stocks every 5 minutes because you're fretting that they could drop, the stock market isn't likely for you. Real estate is a total "buy and hold" proposition (esp. given the large transaction costs).

1557 2018-03-06 14:45:02 On such weak days, look for strength. For example, stocks which closed in green, stocks which did not make a new low when the indices are making new lows etc. Such stocks will recover to new highs first.

1602 2018-03-06 14:30:26 The agent who approved of bump stocks is likely an @NRA member. They should have obviously treated bump stocks like the illegal device to convert a rifle into a machine gun that they are. I mean duh. The @ATFHQ betrayed the American public to the @NRA
1603 2018-03-06 14:30:25 Stop shorting stocks that are trending up and buying stocks that are trending down. In trading we need all the help we can get like swimming with the stream not against.

1615 2018-03-06 14:25:19 "#TradeWar fears subside" writes Zacks. #Stocks rise. True, but, this is a common pattern & psychology preceding stock market #tops! So careful! When the securitized housing boom end arrived in 2008, investor fears subsided also for a time & stocks bounced. Before reality set in.

1619 2018-03-06 14:22:55 I think they are both right, the right to buy is great but needs to run parallel with new builds for sale and rent (whoever does it whatever you call it). Rights to buy has boosted rented housing boom by not replenishing stocks.

1693 2018-03-06 13:47:48 Not true. I looked into bump stocks when they were first on the market. A guy it the range showed me putting my thumb in my belt loop. It was so much fun I looked into getting one. At the time the ATF was unsure and just let it slide (at the behest of the NRA).

1781 2018-03-06 12:56:28 We cannot be bought that easy. This bill should also implement a ban on assault riffles, bump stocks, and AR-15s. And stop taking money from the @NRA!!!

1787 2018-03-06 12:54:32 So sickening.  The GOP are on the wrong side over the majority voters that want a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks & gun sales below 21.

1790 2018-03-06 12:52:55 I agree that things like "bump stocks" shouldn't be legal, however, I disagree that gun control will drasticaly reduce crime. We only need to look at chicago, the most dangerous city in our country, to see that all gun laws do is take guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens

1797 2018-03-06 12:47:29 Lol- do you live under a rock or do you only listen to fox news? It has to be one or the other. Your stocks were doing fine for the last7 years and unemployment was dropping during that time. What specifically was so bad for you under obama that you have this view?

1800 2018-03-06 12:45:36 Is it obvious we struggled with that passage?! Sorry. Wealthfront: direct investing in us stocks, ergo easy to strip a security out. Rest of their non-us-stock portfolio: ETFs, can't be sure that hated security will not be in em. Shoulda just added 2-3 more sentences saying it.

1810 2018-03-06 12:38:14 Lol...you wouldn’t know what courage was if it slapped you in the face. Show some “courage” and answer those questions about Trump’s friend and those steel stocks he sold prior to the tariff announcement.  Bob Mueller’s already up your ass, now the SEC is at the front door...
1811 2018-03-06 12:37:32 Yep, Pay to Play. Corporate America thanks you as they close their stores, but back their own stocks, and screw the small American.
1812 2018-03-06 12:36:42 Never saw the sense of #Lego as a toy. People exclaiming with delight that putting bits of plastic together can make it look like something else. That’s why I’m selling “Sando” at £50/kg. You can mix it with cement and water to make almost anything. Limited stocks.
1813 2018-03-06 12:36:32 I am a gun owner.  I am a hunter but we don't need AK-15's and bump stocks. Have a nice day!
1814 2018-03-06 12:36:30 Trumps buddy Icahn, sells $31 million in steel stocks. 3 days later, Icahns buddy Trump puts tariffs on steel and aluminum. Everybody else lost on steel stock, Icahn somehow knew to sell? Sounds WAY fishy.....
1815 2018-03-06 12:36:21 Endurance Tech,DMart,Escorts,KDDL are few stocks that have done well even during this downfall.
1816 2018-03-06 12:35:52 Great move @manukumarjain ..now i wont ever be able to buy any product. Bcs as soon as i m done with the payment process, the stocks will be over. Great move to loose your customer. Congratulations on finally losing a die hard mi fan. I quit!
1817 2018-03-06 12:35:45 Florida just passed something sensible.The 18 yr olds of today are not as mature as 18 yr olds of yesteryear with a small percentage as exceptions. Bump stocks are unnecessary. Mental health help is seriously needed as kids don’t even know their gender today.
1818 2018-03-06 12:35:28 Two things. 1. I don’t wish to own gun stocks. 2. Anyone who thinks gun stocks are going to recover from the dual negative pressures of social backlash and our idiotic president’s steel tariffs doesn’t know much.
1819 2018-03-06 12:35:27 Also, we live in the era of the 3D printer. The moment Trump said he wanted bump stocks to be illegal the program for 3D printing them appeared online. Same for high capacity mags. Same will happen for AR15's. You can't stop production. You can only change the manufacturers.

1821 2018-03-06 12:35:14 Won't the active share ratio help determine which funds are closet trackers?  Or just looking at a portfolio and seeing if it contains most of the largest bluechip stocks in the FTSE 100.  Broadly similar sector allocations to the index are another clue.

1839 2018-03-06 12:18:56 There is zero evidence that trade war threats are "easing."

Trump has been beating this drum for decades.

Buying stocks because you think Gary Cohn will convince Trump to abandon a central campaign issue is totally absurd. 

Trump will fire Cohn in a heartbeat.
1840 2018-03-06 12:18:45 Yes, commercial pressure is not helping, but Farming and Otters account for far more damage to wild stocks than commercial netters who are mostly hoovering up the stray fish from farming. However this has NOTHING to do with the closed season.
1841 2018-03-06 12:18:37 Please ask the fish. You are forgetting the fish stocks. Any responsible policy on fisheries will be based on the same assessments by marine biologists that informs the #CFA or fish will become extinct and entire communities will suffer.

1871 2018-03-06 11:53:14 I say "[antivirus]" because my original draft showed how @McAfee & @symantec drove UP their stocks. I'd done a years-long daily market-cap analysis since they went IPO.

My broker was floored to learn he could've *passively* turned $1K into $1.7M in 4yrs.
1872 2018-03-06 11:53:12 I think this is wrong. The current account reflects the fact that the financial capital (stocks bonds) is large relative to GDP, so a German who buys a global cap weighted portfolio buys more UK equity than German equity so net savings drives a flow.

1881 2018-03-06 11:38:08 Well you’re wrong on a point there. As a civilian you can actually own a tank. As far as bump stocks are concerned I agree there really is no need for them. It doesn’t matter if they are created to “End Life” or not. A bad person will find ways to do bad things.

1911 2018-03-06 11:16:27 Thanks for posting this. You are right, it says nowhere on there that teens should have bump stocks.
1912 2018-03-06 11:16:16 I know this is like “blowing in the wind” in so many ways but @SenToomey please support S.1916! Bump stocks are a clear attempt to get around existing laws banning machine guns because they allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the same rate as machine guns.
1913 2018-03-06 11:15:49 Last Trading Day of this Financial Year is 26.03.2018.....

Trades from 27.03.2018 onwards will be considered as trades of next financial year....

This is very important wrt LTCG which will be tax free till stocks sold on 26.03.2018.....

Thereafter it will be taxable....
1914 2018-03-06 11:15:19 my error in communication then I suppose. Either way, I think his intuition re: demand as opposed to supply is right. But also have a hard time believing everyone selling gun stocks is by definition transfering lots of wealth to other investors.
1915 2018-03-06 11:14:58 Not much in Tesco in D6 yesterday evening, although there seems to be quite a lot of supplies in Aldi and Lidl.. are the German supermarkets better equipped to deal with this weather?

2260 2018-03-06 06:05:08 We've been bump firing all manner of rifles for years without stocks and gimmicks.   Regulating bump stocks is pointless so perhaps we should see what else you snuck into the bill?

2281 2018-03-06 05:40:42 What have they been charged with? Lying to the corrupted FBI. Where is your proof of "collusion". There is none. HILLARY CLINTON colluded with Russian companies to give them control of 20% of U.S. uranium stocks for money.
2282 2018-03-06 05:40:42 Make it a point to remember that they're being taken to privately-owned, tax-funded detention centers AKA concentration camps where there made to work for free.

2313 2018-03-06 05:10:31 This is why private prison stocks skyrocketed when Trump won. Look up in-sourcing prison labor. More enslaved now than before abolition. Let's take on these sadistic parasites in the GOP. Also, I.C.E. detainees are in the private prisons, slaving for them. Most don't know.

2315 2018-03-06 05:10:03 The reason for all the fuss is that an AR looks like the kinds of guns people see in the movies that are fully automatic. The AR is one pull one shot like most guns. Wanting a ban on bump stocks is totally different and not totally unreasonable.

2317 2018-03-06 05:08:51 Based on what Rachel reported, sounds like a case of rewarding his friends that had stock in the steel industry. Trumps friend Icahn sold his stocks for $31M (?) just before trump announced the tariffs.  Wonder if Ross did the same?
2318 2018-03-06 05:08:25 You can’t use “what about Obama” when he had no avenue or power other than going through congress. 86% of Americans believed bump stocks should be banned yet  The REPUBLICANs who Controlled house and senate blocked the law.

2350 2018-03-06 04:42:10 Yep, except for Trump's friends, cashing in off the stock market, since stocks are artificially being set instead of following offer & demand. If they knew in advance Trump was going to do this, they knew what & when to sell, as well as where & when to invest. Trump's "chaos".

2360 2018-03-06 04:37:27 If the NRA wanted bump stocks banned, they’d be banned already. Really not that hard to do.
2361 2018-03-06 04:36:23 I don’t think bump stocks should face additional regulations, they should be wiped off the face of the earth other than for military use.
2362 2018-03-06 04:34:39 ban on things like bump-stocks or high-capacity magazines because, at least to me, there’s no reason for a civilian to need to fire 45 shots in less than a minute. However, I have no problem with someone owning a hunting rifle or handgun that holds only a few rounds.

2367 2018-03-06 04:29:46 When market falls and most stocks in portfolio tumble, its like salvaging a small boat with an initial hole that we try to plug.

2368 2018-03-06 04:27:37 Tell me why didn’t the ATF under 8 years of Obama do anythjng to regulate bump stocks? Why is this an  @nra problem and not a ATF problem?
2369 2018-03-06 04:26:22 Experience has taught me to always take my market feel from leading stocks. Are quality growth names in leading sectors breaking out of bases on expanding volume and range?

2371 2018-03-06 04:26:00 Why no correction by your co-workers and colleagues on Fox News when Lindsey Graham make false claims like bump stocks make an AR-15 an automatic weapon . Facts are it does not change either the chamber or mechanics of the firing mechanism at all .  Strictly an accessory only .
2372 2018-03-06 04:25:35 not to mention the fact that Bump stocks can be applied to the platform with ease. it's a multi facited problem, but the weapon itself is not the root, but the laws that govern it's ownership, sale and regulate it's after market upgrades.
2373 2018-03-06 04:25:31 When any politician of either side does things like this it’s knee-jerk and it’s not thought through despite the Fact that banning bump stocks or the AR 15 platform does not stop evil people from doing evil actions
2374 2018-03-06 04:25:14 it's human nature. why we can't hold only 4 best stock in our portfolio which can generate alpha ? why we hold n number of best stocks in our portfolio ? we all know only 20% portfolio give us 80% Return. We can't change it.
2375 2018-03-06 04:24:21 Yeah bc people use those to defend their house...stick to the classics Darcy. Leave the guns to the people who understand them. (We both know you weren’t talking about bump stocks but I’ll let that slide) 
2376 2018-03-06 04:23:35 As a side note, there is a world of reasonable space between “supports the 2nd amendment” and 18 year-old with no training or background checks buying AR 15s and bump stocks.
2377 2018-03-06 04:22:28 I'm starting to notice a lack of enthusiasm in the market for even the best, strongest growth stocks. Again, this might be pre-election risk aversion. The market won't break new highs until after it happens - same as 2013. #malaysia #klci

2381 2018-03-06 04:20:09 @LindseyGrahamSC bump stocks do not turn semi automatic rifles into full auto. Where do you get your information? 

And we wonder why law abiding gun owners don't trust elected officials on anything.

Isn't being informed part of your job description?
2382 2018-03-06 04:20:07 @NancyCNBC Goodmorning it is interesting to me all of sudden the focus of market shifted from stocks earning to commodities , steel , aluminium, oil etc! it shows how news dynamic is and so volatility!
2383 2018-03-06 04:19:57 I disagree. All the statement said is the NRA calls on the  ATF to “immediately review.” @NRA just needs to say the words “we support a ban on bump stocks.” They are incapable of taking a firm position that nearly every American would find wise.
2384 2018-03-06 04:18:58 Why do you constantly bring up the 2nd amendment. The majority of democrats do not want to eliminate it. Keep your guns, but  assault weapons and bump stocks need to be outlawed

2386 2018-03-06 04:17:52 I hate you for throwing bump stocks under the bus, you've got to put a stop to dems AND republicans reaching for OUR guns. This is what WE PAY YOU to do. #2a #DefendtheSecond
2387 2018-03-06 04:17:28 The problem I discovered with what I do and how I typically scan for setups was causing me to miss out on many stocks that are already going full blast in the middle of a bull market. A 5-10% pullback may be the best shot I get.

2392 2018-03-06 04:14:22 Markets in Asia are claiming back the losses from y'days session, on hints of softening Trump's stance. Uptick in USD is buoying Exporters, while Resources, Energy stocks also upbeat. Korean bellwethers make some large gains. $NIKKEI +2.18% $ASX+1.17% $SSE+0.21%. BKK: $EA-3.7%.
2393 2018-03-06 04:13:06 Boring and flat day in the market, positions are holding steady. 
So again it appears to be consolodating. Currencies flat, commodities generally flat, stocks flat. DXY losing a little ground under 90 again. My excitement in volitility may have been premature. Shares up a little.

2405 2018-03-06 04:07:04 Isn`t the steel, aluminum prices, for the benefit of the Trump family, who were getting it cheap from China until caught...Didn`t he tell his friends the week prior, so they could drop their stocks before the announcement...hey, Martha Stewart did the time, why not him..

2419 2018-03-06 03:53:39 Douchebag!! Thinks Trump,market, stocks act by reading his tweets.
2420 2018-03-06 03:53:35 I also just looked up bump stocks for mini 14 and yes they do make them.
2421 2018-03-06 03:53:16 The groper in chief said you were afraid of the NRA, only true thing that's come out of his mouth.  Your bill is nice, but not enough.  Ban assault rifles, bump stocks & extended clips, raise age to 21, waiting periods.  If you'd meet w/ constituents, you'd know this.

2429 2018-03-06 03:45:57 How about the huge loan Jared kushner secured for his family.  3 million we spend a weekend for trump to play golf at his resort.  The dumping of stocks by his friends when he declared tariff.  So many examples so little time

2440 2018-03-06 03:35:52 stocks are not money, they are property, not actual money. Stocks are companies. Mutual funds are made up of stocks. To get money out you have to sell the stock to someone else. BOND market is the debt market.
2441 2018-03-06 03:35:43 Bump stocks are only a danger when used with assault style, high capacity magazines.  We need assault weapons ban, 21 age requirement, universal back ground checks, anything less is petty political finger waving.  Litmus test for all US elections, nothing less.

2443 2018-03-06 03:34:07 The Fed officially has a new Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. And ever since he took office, it is clear that “something” has changed at the Fed.

2509 2018-03-06 02:56:59 I think you're ignoring the beauty of diversification. Stocks and bonds and all that are great, but what about real estate? What about liquid assets? Have we even addressed the pros and cons of 401ks, 403bs and even Roth IRAs?
2510 2018-03-06 02:56:52 I follow some great contributors for stocks. Who are some of your top 10?
2511 2018-03-06 02:56:40 And PS, closing the gun-show loophole, banning bump stocks, and making it harder for mentally ill people to buy guns (all things the NRA opposes) ≠ "liberals want to take away your guns." That's just NRA fear-mongering. Why r you so against reasonable measures to make us safer?
2512 2018-03-06 02:56:08 Stocks reverse and end with big gains. Dow +350 points after an early day 100 point loss.
2513 2018-03-06 02:55:54 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
2514 2018-03-06 02:54:34 How old is he?
2515 2018-03-06 02:54:31 Especially when you don’t have your shooters on the floor. Easy to defend that lineup
2516 2018-03-06 02:54:17 His whole spiel is just the distraction of the day. Talk about this and not Steele memo or Trump's buddy dumping his steel stocks or.........on and on.
2517 2018-03-06 02:54:02 I don't know. You thought about commodities? When stocks are up, commodities like gold and silver go down. It's all about diversification. 

No to Sufjan. Late-period Fiona Apple.
2518 2018-03-06 02:53:28 Maybe Ben didn’t have any medical related stocks to inside trade?
2519 2018-03-06 02:52:48 Also Carl Icahn got caught selling more than 30 million in steel related stocks before Trumps announcement of steel tariffs.

And, Trump ex lawyer Michael Cohen admits he has had trouble collecting porn star payoff on behalf of Trump.
2520 2018-03-06 02:52:40 This man kept complementing my nails & my throat tattoo I’m looking at him like ok thanks.. but get back to teaching me about these damn stocks sir

2526 2018-03-06 02:49:44 A put is a contract which you can buy or sell on stocks with options. If you are really new would suggest picking up a few books, or watching trading videos on virtually any trading software. A good book is Technical Analysis by Steven Achelis. Defines anything related to stock.
2527 2018-03-06 02:49:25 Many of my high dollar front runners were the cheap seats when I first bought them.  CELG, ISRG, GRMN, TTWO, AAXN, Even Apple (bought at $4 adjusted first round)  I have been in since a year after they IPOd.  And then I love stocks like Ford that pay 5% dividend. Play and stay
2528 2018-03-06 02:48:47 AR-15, it can be converted if you know what you're doing, to make it fully auto like a machine gun.

Ammo clips that hold more than 10 rounds.

Bump stocks or accessories making a semi-auto fully auto.

Cop killer Ammo is a variety of armor piercing bullets.
2529 2018-03-06 02:47:25 I always am very respectful and enjoy dialogue. But the NRA is on such an extreme they haven’t even come out publicly against bump stocks. I don’t know anyone who thinks bump stocks are a good idea. Most gun owners support reasonable actions but the NRA seems to oppose them all.
2530 2018-03-06 02:46:03 @Carl_C_Icahn Hey Carl-nice job selling your steel stocks. Ask Martha Stewart how that insider trading thing worked out for her. The good news is you'll be able to buy lots of cigarettes in prison with your huge tax cut. You're now an honorary member of the #TrumpCrimeFamily

2532 2018-03-06 02:43:23 If the weapons that can use bump stocks were included in a ban on guns, there would be no need to ban bump stocks! This is a "bait-and-switch" scam!!!
2533 2018-03-06 02:43:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2534 2018-03-06 02:42:44 Sorry to learn that Florida State Senate decided to take assault weapons ban out of school safety final bill. However, raising gun purchase age from 18 to 21 & ban on bump stocks sale are still in.

2536 2018-03-06 02:41:16 HEY! Did I not say that you are my entertainment? How do you get, "If you don't like it you mute me" out of that? If YOU don't like it, YOU can block me you 2A gun-lusted gun-fucker. Say, do bump stocks make the sex with the AR better? Serious question.
2537 2018-03-06 02:40:06 @FBI  -  When will you investigate the obvious crime of insider trading abetted by the WH by Carl Icahn who conveniently sold $31 million worth of steel dependent company stocks just days before Trump announced his imported steel tariffs which crashed these stock prices??
2538 2018-03-06 02:39:37 One thing I noticed was that people who didn't come from a household that invested usually jump straight into the more volatile options that are out there. Penny stocks... or now, cryptocurrency.
2539 2018-03-06 02:39:20 @TheJusticeDept  When will you investigate the obvious crime of insider trading abetted by the WH by Carl Icahn who conveniently sold $31 million worth of steel dependent company stocks just days before Trump announced his imported steel tariffs which crashed these stock prices??
2540 2018-03-06 02:39:01 so there won't be in reporting on your show about Sam Nunberg melting down or Carl Icahn selling millions of dollars of steel stocks the day before Trump announced the tariffs?
2541 2018-03-06 02:38:49 They see stocks that remind them of the good times, they see stocks that remind them of the bad times.
2542 2018-03-06 02:38:29 Year 2017 witnessed no volatility in stocks. 2018 will be a volatile year. With world events & state elections. Don’t panic
2543 2018-03-06 02:38:27 Might’ve been a good thing to do BEFORE the announcement and their stocks tanked.  Just thinking outside of the box here.
2544 2018-03-06 02:37:42 @jimcramer good to see you finally got it right!! $mu is going much higher on this breakout $70 by May!  It's been a great year up 98%!  Let's keep it going. #investors #stocks

2547 2018-03-06 02:36:32 Stories, earnings, valuation don't move  prices; people do. Without a willing buyer, stocks of even the highest-quality cos are just worthless pieces of paper.

2557 2018-03-06 02:31:40 @realDonaldTrump You’re ready to start a trade war to “repay a debt” to Carl Icahn at the expense of causing chaos in the World! You announced “tariffs” 10 days after he sold his steel-related stocks @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC
2558 2018-03-06 02:30:07 @JoyAnnReid question.. listening to @maddow talk about Carl Ichan, would it be considered inside trading since he sold all his steel stocks and then a few days later @realDonaldTrump put tariffs on steel?
2559 2018-03-06 02:30:01 Solid coaching tonight. Down 3 and not have Brown or Snell in? I mean they are awful at shooting and I understand why Bledsoe and Giannis are better options.
2560 2018-03-06 02:29:56 It's not just the AR-15, it's mental health. Stricter gun laws interms of background checks, cool. Banning of bump stocks pointless, one can still bump fire a gun without it. It's not the weapon or tool, it's the person that operates it.
2561 2018-03-06 02:29:54 Was so stupid for handing all my CHDH and HT pin stocks to EJ for Wanderland, now an order just came in, I don’t have any stock on hand, even the display one. Delayed shipping it is.

2565 2018-03-06 02:27:46 @maddow It’s just like the NRA but a smaller scale. Trump was fired up to get rid of A.R. 15’s and bump stocks, he has a meeting with the NRA they write a check nothing gets done. this is why liberals exist. Trump dummies don’t understand how we are not swayed by money like them!
2566 2018-03-06 02:27:40 Its more of a don't get cocky or complacent because your account went up a lot over the last 2 days message to myself.  Heck, we hoped that this would happen when we bought these stocks and now that it did, we focus rather than celebrate.  The battle has just begun.
2567 2018-03-06 02:27:38 Red or Green are just relative terms. Good fundamental stocks will always command a high price.

2583 2018-03-06 02:18:50 The #NRA is responsible for those weapons of war being in our neighborhoods.
They fight to make them legal and they lobby to remove sensible regulations.
They want bump stocks legal and 18 y kids to have access.

When these are used, they are 100% responsible.
2584 2018-03-06 02:18:45 Aircel just closed without any prior intimation. No senior leaders are found to take stocks on the current crisis, 25K direct and indirect employees vendors customers and distributors. Lacs of retailers investment at stake. Will the governing bodies look into crisis
2585 2018-03-06 02:18:34 Bump stocks are important and not necessary... I called 20 dealers across the United States and none of the support the sale of bump stocks... these were chosen by digitally unknown data.  I asked as a person who was interested in them.  Nope, not at all.
2586 2018-03-06 02:18:13 @maddow is the ONLY person keeping up with the #CarlIcahn selling steel stocks just days before #Dotard #TariffTantrum If this isnt a case of #InsiderTrading then I dont know the meaning of those words! #maddow
2587 2018-03-06 02:18:09 Carl Icahn, Trump's millionaire friend had 31 million in steel stocks.  A few weeks ago before Trump announced that he was going to charge $25 tariff on steel, Carl Icahn suddenly sold his steel stock.  How convenient. It suggests that Trump tipped off his friend.
2588 2018-03-06 02:17:24 Do you believe in coincidences? Well I don’t. Nor do I believe that Carl Icahn “coincidentally” sold all of his stocks in Steel right before the Tariffs on Steel were announced. I believe Martha Stewart went to prison for something similar. It’s called fraud, corruption. #Maddow

2598 2018-03-06 02:15:18 Long time Trump associate sold 31 million dollars worth of stocks in Steel 3 days before the new tariffs were announced 

Insider trading much?
2599 2018-03-06 02:14:56 Ban AR-15 and Bump Stocks, more thorough background checks.  That does not take from the 2nd amendment. I don't want to take their guns, especially those of a hunter. No hunter would use an AR-15. They were make to kill people. Handguns with a permit, no problem.
2600 2018-03-06 02:14:50 Carl Icahn’s sale of stocks just days before Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum doesn’t even pass the smell test-stocks that would’ve tanked if tariffs imposed. HOPE THIS WILL BE SCRUTINIZED BY MUELLER.

2603 2018-03-06 02:12:42 It was just 24 hours ago that we found out a Trump friend dumped stocks ahead of the tariff announcement. We need a running ticker to keep up.
2604 2018-03-06 02:12:23 Now there wouldn’t be a lil old fashion insider trading in steel stocks that happened before announcements of Tariffs -do you  think
2605 2018-03-06 02:11:37 Rachel Maddow said Sam Nunberg’s appearances today were weird. The Don and Carl Icahn connection. Selling off 30 million in shares of stocks. Should be on someone’s radar.  Stormy payment paid by Cohen. He wants his money back!! Should be on someone’s radar. Mess!!!
2606 2018-03-06 02:11:24 So investor Carl Icahn dumps steel stocks. Days later President Parvenue announces tariffs on steel and aluminum. So which is the tail and which is the dog?
2607 2018-03-06 02:11:04 Oh he just happened to know steel stocks would go down. Martha Stewart is livid!
2608 2018-03-06 02:10:35 Tell me senator, how many people have been killed by bump stocks? Surely our tax dollars could be spent on something better like our veterans considering that 22 of them commit suicide every day but I don't hear you talking about that

2623 2018-03-06 02:03:15 Yeah, I've been all over and seen different states. There's a variety and the south is the worst in my opinion, but the overall reactions are just scary these days. People buying up bump stocks after a massacre and such is crazy to me.
2624 2018-03-06 02:02:53 BUDZ was up -400 at some point. I use CAPS to track my general investment philosophy. I have about 35-40 stocks and 80+ picks in CAPS and it gives me incentive to do some more research. I’ve talked to DG about the CAPS limitations and think they are working on something.
2625 2018-03-06 02:02:44 In stocks people loss money all the time but truthfully consider madoff more of a scam.

2627 2018-03-06 02:01:22 175 yield decreases ending stocks  yoy with demand the same as this year.
2628 2018-03-06 02:00:16 It is. Also on Stocks twits now.
2629 2018-03-06 02:00:09 bump stocks don't allow semi-autos to fire at the same rate as fully automatic and once again once you ban the ones that are being sold how are you going to get the ones that are already out in the public back outside of going door-to-door without warrants
2630 2018-03-06 02:00:02 Someone needa take my phone away while I study bc I have the shortest attention span in the world. I get one text, and I end up checking all social media, checking the weather for the week, looking at stocks, and then I’ve lost all motivation to study

2633 2018-03-06 01:59:11 Yeah buddy! Pot stocks rising! Smoke up people! (Legally please, so I can make money off it hehe)
2634 2018-03-06 01:59:04 European stocks rose on Monday as investors dismissed worries of political gridlock in Italy after inconclusive elections.
2635 2018-03-06 01:59:02 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone missing in action and I are honored to stop the government….

2637 2018-03-06 01:57:14 US stocks rose on Monday, as investors grew increasingly confident that pressure from domestic and international sources would force President Donald Trump to back down on his threat to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.
2638 2018-03-06 01:56:18 He and the republicans just presented what they want. No one under 21, no bump stocks, increase background checks, funding for arm guards, funding for hardening schools. More laws to follow but if not enforced like the ones Cruz just violated will solve nothing.
2639 2018-03-06 01:55:58 How about you introduce legislation to ban semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks along with comprehensive background checks so that children don't need to fear being murdered at school? #ny19 #GunControlNow
2640 2018-03-06 01:54:56 Good for them but more companies are buying back stocks with the extra $$. The big payouts are to CEOs and shareholders.  Don't be fooled by the crumbs. And what about all the blue collar manufacturing workers who will lose their jobs because of Trumps petulant trade war?
2641 2018-03-06 01:54:54 What if the only way to sell out of your stocks was to buy into NYSEUSD? And it just so happened NYSE owned NYSEUSD. Would you feel comfortable with that?
2642 2018-03-06 01:54:36 The AR-15 might not be an assault weapon but it is a common choice for mass shootings because of its high round capacity & easy accessibility if you add the ability to use bump stocks to increase the capacity & projectile speed you have a weapon ideal for ripping bodies apart
2643 2018-03-06 01:54:09 It's much easier to buy guns and bullets than it is to buy stocks and bonds. Do you know why?
2644 2018-03-06 01:53:48 Yes. That’s why I don’t get why the Rockefellers are so pro-ESG. 

I’m thankful for every person that adds SRC criteria to their portfolio for allowing me to make more money on my soda, tobacco, alcohol, and oil stocks.

2648 2018-03-06 01:51:09 too little. Ban assault weapons. Background check for ALL sales even gun shows and private sales. Ban bump stocks.

2652 2018-03-06 01:49:10 "If impeachment happens, presumably the market will get roiled. So, maybe it's time to pull out of stocks and get into something stable for a bit, like T-Bills?"
"You think the United States treasury would be a safe place for your money?"
2653 2018-03-06 01:48:32 Stocks recover because everybody knows Trump is a fucking liar.
2654 2018-03-06 01:48:08 My momma @coffeebrk! As I grew up, I’d get Canadian savings bonds for Christmas/birthdays. When they matured, she cashed them & taught me how to invest that $ in stocks and walked me through it all at a young age! #InvestSmart #BMOforWomen

2656 2018-03-06 01:46:09 The Fed is a MASSIVE stock owner, having bought stocks for years to halt corrections (idiots!!).
If they're going to be shut down, as it appears, their holdings need to be liquidated.
This will cause a short-term market crash.
2657 2018-03-06 01:45:48 my favorite teacher was talking about stocks so i said how kylie jenner ruined snapchats stock value so she said “who is kylie jenner? she’s a nobody” now i gotta drop out

2659 2018-03-06 01:45:01 RT @SenFeinstein: Bump stocks are a clear attempt to get around existing laws banning machine guns because they allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the same rate as machine guns. Our bill is the only real solution! Urge Republicans to back S.1916!
2660 2018-03-06 01:44:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2661 2018-03-06 01:44:07 I am in no hurry whatsoever to get married. I am in a hurry to be financially stable. A 750 credit score, a mutual fund, stocks, a diversified portfolio and the like? Yes please.
2662 2018-03-06 01:43:03 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

2670 2018-03-06 01:39:19 I take it that doesn't mean shared British fish stocks?  I heard that rather than taking back our waters you ask for a greater allocation of British fish stocks. We don't want any allocation, we want our waters back completely.

2672 2018-03-06 01:38:22 Driving is a privilege, not a Constitutional right. 
Bump stocks sound bizarre, but it may be possible to make them at home. Large clips are sensible at ranges.
The rage that leads to mass shootings needs to be treated before the shooting starts.

2676 2018-03-06 01:33:51 As long as the bill doesn’t include anything other than bump stocks, you should be fine.  Both sides tend to add on a lot of crap that we the people don’t need nor want. Let’s start putting forth bills that tackle the actual issue.
2677 2018-03-06 01:33:48 In studio guest @_Ashleymfox shares her approach to buying stocks: "I buy what I know."
2678 2018-03-06 01:32:51 Ban semi automatics, bump stocks, raise minimum age to 25, improve background investigations & STOP empowering the NRA!
2679 2018-03-06 01:31:57 The stocks movement will depend on the commentary given by experts and the management.
2680 2018-03-06 01:31:44 Both the stocks are in downtrend. For fresh entry wait for reversal sign.
2681 2018-03-06 01:31:39 What if I die first? At least I got to see kelela instead of waiting for some fucking stocks to go up lmfao
2682 2018-03-06 01:31:34 Like starving millions of indians by diverting all food supplies to Europe even after adequate stocks were available there... The  so called greatest britisher was a mass murderer.

2686 2018-03-06 01:29:20 Trading stocks based on information that isn’t public knowledge (insider info) is extremely illegal for both parties. Such as selling stocks that would be crushed by tariffs, days before a tarrif is announced. There will prolly be an investigation the timing is far too fishy

2688 2018-03-06 01:28:42 Stocks erased early losses after President Trump said Mexico and Canada can avoid metals tariffs with a new NAFTA deal. The Dow snapped a four-day losing streak.
2689 2018-03-06 01:28:20 Unless you are willing to put in the effort to learn how to read/interpret financial statements you really shouldn't select stocks your self
2690 2018-03-06 01:27:46 That is factually incorrect, but I agree that Bump stocks should be illegal.

2693 2018-03-06 01:26:12 que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien, que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine, que tu me dises que c’est rien

2700 2018-03-06 01:22:43 Diane, I agree with you in this one rare case that bump stocks are dangerous. However a bump stock can be made with a belt. Are you going to ban belts? I don't think so. Wouldn't it be great if liberals actually understood anything about guns.

2703 2018-03-06 01:20:53 Well, that's not quite right.  The #NRA has taken no position on bump stocks, deferring to the BATF for a determination.  And they don't turn a semi-auto into a full auto.  Useless tactically, and something I don't allow on my range.
2704 2018-03-06 01:19:55 Universal background checks, banning private sales, banning semi-automatics, large mags, bump stocks... these ideas and others are all worth supporting or at least exploring.
2705 2018-03-06 01:19:50 mind you during all this,i do support stronger BG checks both civil and mental.longer wait for actual aquisition.bump stocks or anything similar needs banned,offer serious compensation for those in circulation to be turned in/destroyed.focus on the failed use of existing laws/cks

2710 2018-03-06 01:18:37 Toby always   the toilet stocks !!   
2711 2018-03-06 01:18:33 So investors can choose to buy/not buy #gun stocks, to own and actively address C-suite they finance, to choose when the do the #WallSt walk away. If #LarryFink’s @blackrock #CEO letter matters, #GunViolence in #USA is public health crisis deserving place on #ESG priorities 3/3
2712 2018-03-06 01:18:19 Selling 30 million in stocks days before it would’ve lost 5 mil??? That ain’t fishy to you? Martha Stewart was arrested for doing the same thing with $230k
2713 2018-03-06 01:18:19 smh at these guys who simultaneously believe 1) insider info/trading is rampant and 2) they can ST trade biotech stocks. If 1 is true then only game for us normies is the LT one since LT insights can’t leak but rather play out over time.
2714 2018-03-06 01:18:04 I focus solely on US stocks.
But I’d also do the same type of statistical research if I was focused on any other type of securities.
2715 2018-03-06 01:17:45 Thank you President Trump for your courage taking a tough crusade to save this country-we must end lobbyists specialy foreign ones &congress'ability to do insider trading(buy stocks-pass policy to advantage that industry & then sell like Pelosi did with Visa) that woman is the 1%

2718 2018-03-06 01:16:47 Bump stocks, age limit to 21 years... any other ideas? 
It's time to demand real gun control, not doctoring around on the edges to market yourself in an election cycle.

2721 2018-03-06 01:15:55 The bump stocks in your bill isnt the issue. Its everything else that you piled in with it. If we all wanted California restrictions we would choose to live in CA or NY. Most of us do not. @SenateGOP Do NOT support this bill, propose your own. Thanks.
2722 2018-03-06 01:15:47 Clearly you know nothing about bump stocks. You cannot accurately fire a bump stock at a rapid rate of fire. Automatic rifles are far superior. Bump stocks are pure novelty #giveuponbumpstocks #NRALifeMember

2727 2018-03-06 01:13:33 It's done by increments.
First - Ban bump stocks.
Second - Ban anyone on medication.
Third - Neighbours of those on medication.
Fourth - Those in non Federal employment.
Fifth - Anyone WE say.....
2728 2018-03-06 01:13:21 So trumps friend sold off 30 million in steel related stocks 2 days before the tarriff? At what point does congress step in and put a stop to all this?
2729 2018-03-06 01:13:15 Agreed. Bump stocks need to go and I’m a conservative Republican
2730 2018-03-06 01:13:00 Bump stocks are a clear attempt to get around existing laws banning machine guns because they allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the same rate as machine guns. Our bill is the only real solution! Urge Republicans to back S.1916!

2737 2018-03-06 01:08:59 Bump stocks? Really? How about being the responsible adult in the room and call for increased security for our schools, instead of making them soft targets! Armed staff and signs stating school staff is armed. Like in Texas!
2738 2018-03-06 01:08:21 I think these people in congress that dont like the Tarrifs actually have stocks involved. what if we go to war and we have to rely on the enemy for metal!

2740 2018-03-06 01:07:59 You on to something, don’t trade small caps much on these days, bigger stocks move in points and patterns are more recognizable, dont need to to buy 2k shares to make 400, 100-200 shares couple of points is all u need IMO
2741 2018-03-06 01:07:24 Why do you think it's all for the rich .
I have say stocks in Bank of america .
Trump makes it easier to borrow money .
1) my stock goes up 
2) you get to borrow money easier .  I dont get rich get richer . Help me understand ..
2742 2018-03-06 01:07:18 One more reason why the idea of stocks and shareholders is basically immoral. 'Corporations' should be exclusively worker-owned. They can raise capital through bonds. Privately owned business should be mandated to follow pay scales linking wage-earner income to executive income.
2743 2018-03-06 01:07:03 Disgraceful easy to circumvent, why are they singling out bump fire stocks, gun control bill on AR15 & any like rifle or rifle, it should be unlawful to make ANY modifications to ANY rifle to make it automatic, this bill is just ignorant & what happen to loop hole gun show sales
2744 2018-03-06 01:05:59 nice portfolio, are you diversifying into things like real estate and traditional equities, funds, bonds and stocks? To have over 50% of your money in just crypto that's not ETH is pretty risky
2745 2018-03-06 01:05:27 And it not just how fast one can pull a trigger on his AR, it’s what the NRA stands for. At a time when we live in fear that some nut job will walk into a public room and cut down everyone. It’s the NRA that supports bump stocks, turning those semi auto into full auto, they have
2746 2018-03-06 01:04:23 And, meanwhile, your Executive Order about bump stocks has yet to see light of day? And raising the age people are allowed to buy rifles?   And can't you show the love and word a DACA bill on your own or with a bit of help from advisers? What is stopping you? Don't you CARE?  1/2
2747 2018-03-06 01:03:55 Did Oil stocks get cheaper during the correction?

2750 2018-03-06 01:00:01 And corporations are doing massive stock buy backs. They get a windfall and buy back stocks.. nice!!! Division of wealth is going strong.

2752 2018-03-06 00:58:36 Fear about rate increases means investors find dividend stocks like telecoms and utilities less attractive compared to more growth oriented ones like tech companies

2755 2018-03-06 00:57:47 @NRATV My truth-I want common sense: a ban on bump stocks, large capacity mags, military-style assault weapons & let's get some REAL background checks. A legit check takes more than 3 days. Mercy! Took more than 3 days for my security clearance when I enlisted.
2756 2018-03-06 00:57:43 Cory Gardner, nra repub senator from CO, STILL has not taken a stand on assault weapons or bump stocks? Really? Almost 3 weeks & no comment? Sucking on an appendage of Wayne LaPierre's taking 2 much time? Would he be AWOL if it was his kid's school?
2757 2018-03-06 00:56:04 Waley akong talent magsoco, so yung unang magsshare ng pictures or videos padadalhan ko ng tikoy! Marami pa kami stocks hahahaha!  #DforK
2758 2018-03-06 00:55:30 Yet stocks are up!! Owning libs so hard!
2759 2018-03-06 00:55:12 Very disappointed in todays SB7026 passing. It goes directly against the #2A. Bump stocks are one thing, but raising the age limit, a possible ban on triggers (has no impact on fire rate) and a 3-day wait period goes against the constitution. Use R’s won’t forget this.
2760 2018-03-06 00:55:01 You come close every night. Someday little Larry

2764 2018-03-06 00:53:41 I don’t know, seems like a pretty big leap from my saying stocks are passive income to my broadcasting loud & clear that I want the govt to steal for me. But you don’t know me so you’d probably know better.
2765 2018-03-06 00:53:25 Uh, he has been in for 12 months and the stocks have boomed. But thanks for you investment advice just the same.
2766 2018-03-06 00:52:44 sir, if u have been in market for a while, u must hav noticed that stock reaction these days come one or two days before actual day...the same has happened with all auto stocks and the numbers day faced profit booking ...
2767 2018-03-06 00:52:17  your money is in "stocks" i didn't know you were a teacher, thank God for you, teachers are so important; thank you for your service
2768 2018-03-06 00:50:55 False narrative on your part. And you know it. Assault rifles ., high capacity magazines and bump stocks are not defensive.
2769 2018-03-06 00:49:26 Do you hold both traditional stocks and crypto?
2770 2018-03-06 00:49:19 Nope, we didn't trade those stocks today. Nice job though Mish! :)
2771 2018-03-06 00:48:30 That wasn’t very smart, steel stocks are being rated as buy, and their values are going up!
2772 2018-03-06 00:47:39 Are there still stocks?
2773 2018-03-06 00:46:56 Who are the folks that own stocks?

2777 2018-03-06 00:43:32 Bump stocks can be made in 10 minutes. What a waste of time for Congress. You're not very smart, are you?
2778 2018-03-06 00:42:37 What other items are in your bill Senator? If it is a clean bill just banning bump stocks it will pass no problem
2779 2018-03-06 00:42:15 Didn't you sell all your stocks because Trump won? Doing quick math, that would be a 30+/'% missed opportunity? Don't think you need to make anymore economic decisions or suggestions.Just saying
2780 2018-03-06 00:42:08 RT @SenFeinstein: An executive order banning bump stocks would be tied up in courts for YEARS and do nothing to prevent their sale in the meantime! A legislative fix is the only way to ensure the safety of our communities.
2781 2018-03-06 00:41:06 $WIN $WPI almost have same pattern at the end. I guess there will be a pullback at the start same as $PHES . I included $ALCO $IS  in my watchlist don't know why hahaha. Good luck! #tradingneverstops #traderlifeph #stocks #stockmarketph #dailygrind #novice
2782 2018-03-06 00:40:54 If bump stocks should be banned by order, why block legislation?

2786 2018-03-06 00:39:54 Easy. We actually do agree on a few things here. I'm for the banning of bump stocks and agree that anything that remotely resembles a mass shooting is bad. I know. Don't be to shocked.  I'm just not on board with disarming lawful gun owners which is the only recourse left.
2787 2018-03-06 00:39:37 san maganda maginvest? or someone please teach me about stocks huhuhu

2794 2018-03-06 00:34:26 Got it.  Both should be gone as well as bump stocks. Sure we disagree.  Best wishes to you that no one you love is impacted directly by a mass shooting regardless of how you choose to define a mass shooting. In my mind anything that remotely resembles a mass shooting is bad.
2795 2018-03-06 00:34:08 Interestingly, the Common Fisheries Policy, whilst controversial and certainly not perfect, has stabilised declining fish stocks and in many areas (including some areas of the UK) has allowed fish stocks to start growing again.

2797 2018-03-06 00:32:39 Depends sis if may extra stocks~ 
2798 2018-03-06 00:31:12 That's not even true. Bump stocks do help a semi-automatic fire faster, but not as fast as an automatic. Bump stocks also reduce accuracy. 
IMO, bump stocks should be regulated.
2799 2018-03-06 00:30:59 It’s like buying stocks. If they don’t pay dividends you should sell and buy new ones.

2803 2018-03-06 00:29:39 If anyone in Paul ryans office traded stocks before that got reported on, it would be borderline insider trading. IMHO his defection is what helped rally the markets.

2805 2018-03-06 00:29:29 Well since the President makes up policies without consulting any of the involved departments, advisers, or industries I end up with a huge hit to my US stocks. But i'm sure when you see your beer prices go up, it'll click for you too.
2806 2018-03-06 00:29:27 Bump stocks dont kill people, people do.
2807 2018-03-06 00:28:22 Jim Cramer tracks the return of personal computers and how it makes semiconductor stocks like Micron look cheap.
2808 2018-03-06 00:28:21 Jim Cramer explains why certain stocks will be essentially unaffected by tariffs on some Chinese imports.
2809 2018-03-06 00:27:21 Doesn't this mean even more $ will flow into stocks before the stock bubble bursts? Sure gold will get a boost as well but stocks will go from insane valuations to ridiculously insane valuations before they pop...
2810 2018-03-06 00:26:33 Think of all of the people who invested in Snapchat and bought stocks and lost like everything after the newest update 
2811 2018-03-06 00:26:18 Okay how about Las Vegas.... Cops didn't ignore anyone there. 450 dead/injured...among them cops... and bump-stocks are still legal. The problem is that there isn't common sense gun regulations
2812 2018-03-06 00:24:53 Definitely need to invest in some tampon stocks 
2813 2018-03-06 00:24:20 I agree with you. While it may seem unfair to the companies affiliated (that really have nothing to do with guns), at the end of the day, do we want to give money to a company that makes assault rifles? I know I do not! Same reason I don't invest in gun or tobacco stocks.
2814 2018-03-06 00:23:31 Yes, I think investments first too, that's why my $1 million+ dream car is just that...a dream. I don't want to dump the real estate, stocks, etc. just yet.

2818 2018-03-06 00:21:34 I see junior mining stocks on ASX going in a good direction in 2018, specially sense ASX outperforms one of there traditional rivals in stock exchange mining.
2819 2018-03-06 00:21:24 With AR15s and bump stocks?
2820 2018-03-06 00:20:56 Well it’s semi-automatic but I was trying to limit word count to fit in my original sentence structures 
But yes probably bump stocks would be a good start - I believe without it an AR-15 is not that destructive?
2821 2018-03-06 00:20:45 That’s how I’ve been feeling for a while. Taught myself to trade stocks to try to get a job where I dont have to report to anyone and can just go to work on my couch. Just need to get better at it and have more money available to increase the profit margin
2822 2018-03-06 00:20:34 @askwarrenbuffet 

Hello Mr.Buffet:

I want to invest in Penny Stocks. Would you be willing to give me advice on the best direction to take.

Thank You
2823 2018-03-06 00:20:13 It would be great if: 
students had supplies to learn
Teachers didn't have to spend their own money
Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks.
Natl dbase for gun sales and gun violence
Register yearly w/fee
Gun insurance.
Lives over party.
2824 2018-03-06 00:20:00 Or even futures man. But seriously... why insist on a market where the edge is pretty much gone and only algos left behind. There’s a reason why people are leaving stocks. You can apply your strategy to other instruments bro.
2825 2018-03-06 00:19:58 Kachra, crap and chakri stocks are are like terminally ill cancer patients having multiple organ failure. Just because  you are emotionally connected to your purchase price does not mean that you will get it back.  And stocks are NOT family members. Yaha dawa kaam ayegi na Dua !
2826 2018-03-06 00:19:40 It’s going to get so much worse before it gets better, $0.60 dollar and great deals on 1/2 price Canadian bank stocks
2827 2018-03-06 00:18:48 ... and these bump stocks will be even easier to get on the 'Black Market' for the right price.
2828 2018-03-06 00:18:42 I’m working on several scans now... DM me and I’ll send you some info. This one looks for stocks within 15% of 6month high as a starter... RSI above 52%... and some other criteria I value

2830 2018-03-06 00:18:23 May stocks ba ang Viva Entertainment? ABSCBN alam ko meron, if Viva pursues and convinces Maine, I want to buy stocks in @VivaArtists 

I love how Viva takes care of their artists. You're in good hands. Each of them shine on their own.
2831 2018-03-06 00:17:23 Come trade Fx where things actually move every day. I left stocks for these same reasons you tweet about every day.
2832 2018-03-06 00:16:56 Can someone explain to me why the Nordstrom family tried to buy out the company's shares at less than the current NYSE share price?

Admittedly I don't know much about how stocks or company valuations work, but...doesn't that just seem like a really stupid idea?
2833 2018-03-06 00:16:14 @WalshFreedom Nowhere does the 2nd Amendment express the notion that private citizens should have the right to bear assault weapons, bump stocks, or, for that matter, nuclear weapons. You want a musket? Knock yourself out.
2834 2018-03-06 00:15:51 This idea that good guys with AR15 and bump stocks are going to come to rescue people is not credible. Real life isn’t like a Stallone film
2835 2018-03-06 00:15:41 I belive that there is still more upside over coming months. I am happy to buy stocks like $WPL here. $BHP and $RIO I think have lower levels in the short term.
2836 2018-03-06 00:15:29 @smartertrader I have been a subscriber for a few years and you have helped make me money for that whole time. No one zeroes in on what stocks are in play (which is critical when playing weekly options) and interprets news better than you. No one.

2838 2018-03-06 00:14:24 The problem with buying BBOZ as a hedge is that your stocks might have a low correlation to the market, so you could have a situation where your stocks start getting sold down but the market could still be heading higher.
2839 2018-03-06 00:13:46 Buying stocks on margin.

2851 2018-03-06 00:07:43 Executive order is not necessary.  Bump stocks will go the way of the Dodo bird.  They are a novelty and will die a natural death if left alone.  With your constant and incessant rant about them, you have sold thousands to gun enthusiasts that never had a desire to own one.
2852 2018-03-06 00:07:08 @chrisdanielshow  quick idea on dealing with these kids calling in shooter threats on schools, it'd probably stop if we publicly flogged them, just lock the kid in some stocks and get a big Burly a hooded executioner type kind of guy to flog them with a leather belt a few times
