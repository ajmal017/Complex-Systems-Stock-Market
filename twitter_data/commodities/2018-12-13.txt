1 2018-12-13 23:45:19 I’m trying to highlight the fact that migrants are people not commodities
And my argument isn’t with you but with those who see FoM as a burden and not a right that benefits us all

2 2018-12-13 23:44:59 Nope. Much of the infrastructure is built to cater for the influx of money. Flats are traded as commodities, not lived in. But none the less, if you can't recognise it at all, how would you know it was your town?
3 2018-12-13 23:24:18 The only way Pastor Pence becomes POTUS is if his boss gets impeached & convicted & I don't see where those 66-67 votes are coming from for that.. it'd require 16 GOP senators of integrity & duty..& it's a desert out there of those 2 commodities..
4 2018-12-13 23:18:30 Eventually the dollar will drop, at which point there will be other least bad options- ie. commodities

The globalist are the modern day slave owners that have only one goal to cheat and commodities labor. 
Same song since Babylon.
9 2018-12-13 22:41:26 I agree with animals needing rights but with all the political & legal wranglings over what that means, we can't just jump into it. Welfare means to provide care, not just as commodities. Its an act of doing what's right for others while in our care, which needs to improve.
10 2018-12-13 22:40:22 I feel really good about the way I am investing my money right now, putting most of my money in real estate and commodities, and buying small amounts of Wells Fargo stock while it is trading at really low prices.
11 2018-12-13 22:40:22 He is unproven batting .200 in the majors. I want proven commodities on this team. Santana gets on base more than EE I’m good with that but we need power hitting outfielders that are proven and can produce now! Not in 2-3 years! hoping he is just a piece of a huge trade puzzle
12 2018-12-13 22:40:07 Maybe a repeat of "reflation trade" in 2017. Fed pauses, $ weakens, stocks and commodities rally until the fed is forced to hike again maybe in six months. The other scenario is recession and stronger $. Don't think stocks and $ can have a sustained rally toghether from here.

14 2018-12-13 22:33:13 Palladium, a silvery-white metal used in cars and sometimes jewelry, has topped gold in commodities trading for the last three days.

16 2018-12-13 22:32:14 “Caused by a strong economy and weak social skills” - not employers have been granted carte blanche to treat people as commodities so it removes the loyalty between the parties.

18 2018-12-13 22:30:05 But I think investors will likely carry on investing. The pound may fall, but commodities should stay robust....
19 2018-12-13 22:29:06 SST. #dogs and #cats are treated as #commodities in this country and global! This is disturbing and needs to be investigated of the .@USDA has any human dignity left in its office! Pets are bearing the brunt of this Vile Human Race!!
