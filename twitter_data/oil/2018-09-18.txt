7 2018-09-18 23:59:17 You missed it all. Restructure means autonomy for either regions or states. The unitry system now is not federalism, but stealing regional wealth and deceitfully robing oil on children's mouth. How many of the pupils are politicians children if it's something good?
8 2018-09-18 23:59:11 once I got sage essential oil and a water filter and I’m lol if anyone takes this what will they do !
9 2018-09-18 23:59:01 Instead of taking once or twice a day, try using the oil in small doses several times over the day. Use 1/4 or 1/5 dropper at a time. It takes a few min to work. Let us know how it goes.

19 2018-09-18 23:57:41 I don’t know how people use quick dry nail polish, as an oil painter the longer it is wet the better, same goes with nails (for me) until I get the top coat on.

43 2018-09-18 23:57:16 Invite kids. And I am only partially kidding. I’ve done a couple of school presentations - one where palm oil followed Microsoft’s virtual reality talk abt tough crowd. Kids ask the unexpected. And they are way more critical #justsaying

48 2018-09-18 23:56:52 I’m actually pretty pumped about my @younglivingeo essential oil started kit. I can’t wait until it gets here.
49 2018-09-18 23:56:43 clary sage oil with a heating  pad( sock filled with rice and warmed up in the microwave works best) hot ginger tea or thermacare heatwraps

69 2018-09-18 23:54:19 I think he's just more obvious about it. Look no further than that drone bombing friend to the central banks, Barack Obama. He did  little to reverse the vile impact of Bush Jnr's toxic legacy. But he was a better snake oil salesman than Donald Trump and far sneakier.

71 2018-09-18 23:53:55 ps - I also noticed that he did not mention that EU countries buy oil and gas from Russia and the US wants the EU to stop using the pipelines and opt for importing US fracked oil and gas across the Atlantic - as illogical as that sounds.

79 2018-09-18 23:53:16 Basic vegan cooking strategy: look to see what vegetables need to be eaten; spice the hell out of them; sautée in coconut oil or olive oil; add a dash of lime juice (and maybe some white wine); add protein (tofu/tempeh/chickpeas/etc); put on rice; win!
80 2018-09-18 23:53:14 You wont have a heart attack if you use olive oil. I used to drink a cap full everyday.

84 2018-09-18 23:52:02 Tatcha deep cleanse, herbivore rose moisturizer, herbivore orchid oil. I also really liked the glam glow youth mud exfoliater. My skin is soooo nice from this combo
85 2018-09-18 23:51:59 The only believers who will be left behind will be those who didn’t have oil in their lamps. Oil represents the Holy Spirit. These would refer to the ones who were backslidden. Should be interesting nevertheless. I believe in Pre-Trib but we should be ready for whatever comes.
86 2018-09-18 23:51:57 85 Celsius is really hot for a chip (125 Celsius is the melting point), you drastically reduce this lifetime 75 Celsius is the sweet spot. Another solution will be mineral oil in a fish tank or a icebox for a quiet mining.
87 2018-09-18 23:51:51 My dad didn't want me frying just yet so he put the fries in the freezer instead

107 2018-09-18 23:49:04 Nuclear takes along time to bring online and China wants a quick transition away from coal.  I understand your point but I think the long term outlook is that LNG will be in tight supply (like oil) and Asia will route for B.C. LNG regardless due to proximity + security of supply.
108 2018-09-18 23:48:59 Trump wants the support of big billion dollar companies so that he can stay in office or get perks from them. Oil companies don't care who they kill as long as they have their BIG BUCKS while they are alive. Private jets, big houses in 5 continent's, $$food!
109 2018-09-18 23:48:45 Stories are being made for Raqqa and deir zor about fake daesh soldiers, why? Oil & Gas reserves. These towns are destroyed but British and American oil and gas companies roaming freely protected by western and private contracted armies.
110 2018-09-18 23:48:30 I had the same realisation a few years ago when I wanted to find out what my nanna fed me after I snorted too much albas oil and wouldn’t stop crying. I miss being 5 and force fed blancmange after snorting something weird.  My nanna is gone but the blancmange lives on

115 2018-09-18 23:46:43 Push the pan so that side is off the burner, take a pound of ground turkey that you’ve rolled into little balls or whatever, add a bit more olive oil to the other side of the pan and put the meat in. Cook one side, flip to the other, then add a tsp of salt and a tsp of chili pwdr

126 2018-09-18 23:45:05 I can cook. I can also change an oil filter and drive stick. Big deal
127 2018-09-18 23:45:04 Dude yes it’s super cheap. Cut up a bell pepper, dice about half an onion and mince a few cloves of garlic. Cook the onion and peppers in olive oil in a big skillet, when it’s about ready add the minced garlic for the last 30 secs or so. Then push all that to the side of the pan

134 2018-09-18 23:43:27 That's why they're Trump supporters. Believing he'll make them rich and giving them a forum to place blame. They don't even see he's a snake oil salesman
135 2018-09-18 23:43:26 I believe that the car companies, along with BigOil, should take the responsibility for both pollution and climate change. They have known about this for decades, lied and cheated the sell their poison  and killing machines. 
It certainly is time to end the oil age.

137 2018-09-18 23:43:09 I'm wondering if, rather than cut pay. maybe a better to solution to our current rake of scandals is Omega 3 fish oil supplements for politicians. It's supposed to be good for memory and a lot of them seem wild forgetful about what they knew. Could be the Seven Seas Protocol.

143 2018-09-18 23:41:57 Wonder when's the last time he changed the oil in his hair..?
144 2018-09-18 23:41:53 The most recent case of the attempted Trans Mountain nationalization should clearly demonstrate that the government’s ability to run an oil related business is sorely lacking.  They can’t build a simple pipeline and you expect them to run complex mining and refining operations.
145 2018-09-18 23:41:51 I put on the Tom ford shimmer oil and was ashy again within minutes
146 2018-09-18 23:41:45 lavender and orange essential oil is such a good combo

152 2018-09-18 23:40:59 I wish I could figure out my AutoImm issue. I dont trust any Dr. & have been doing it alone for 10 yrs. Tried so many diff AI diets, just got plant paradox, if it doesn't work CBD oil will have to be my next move.
153 2018-09-18 23:40:47 Reminder that the changing of the season means GET YOUR CAR MAINTENANCED. Windshield wipers should be changed, check the tire treads to make sure you have decent tires to get through winter, also OIL CHANGES. Get your vehicle inspected!
154 2018-09-18 23:40:43 I want the best deal too. But I really don't know how we can do it. I don't think this government is capable of reaching a fair trade.
The US is now the top oil producer in the world. Too bad the pipelines weren't built to compete.
155 2018-09-18 23:40:39 I need some shea butter , coconut oil and blistex

160 2018-09-18 23:40:11 Look into legal hemp oil. It’s available online, in health food stores and vitamin stores. It helps, not like xanax, but better than nothing.

162 2018-09-18 23:40:01 The US turned down Putin’s offer to work together solely because they want regime change in order to install a US-puppet leader, splinter Syria & gain control of vital oil pipelines. Oh, and it’s what Israel demands too.

But with Adam's guidance, and Johnny's inspiration, we published Oil Contracts on Friday, and made many new friends in the process
171 2018-09-18 23:39:25 Well, good luck on getting a new pipeline to tidewater! You better hurry up on the KXL (re. Northern Leg) before they lockup Donald or the US do a deal with Venezuela. The Chinese don't care about the ethical oil nonsense; I think the Chinese will take Iranian Oil :-P

182 2018-09-18 23:38:17 I do this. And also use lavender oil in a diffuser! Definitely helps!
183 2018-09-18 23:38:16 I have oil right now from Canadian LPs at 30%. No one would buy 3% thc.
184 2018-09-18 23:38:14 Or perhaps “hang Christmas lights”. Or “change the oil in a car” or “change a flat tire”.

If it got flipped, it’d be like asking a man if he can change a tire & him defensively saying “WELL CAN YOU SEW AN AMERICAN FLAG THE SIZE OF A QUARTER FOOTBALL FIELD WHILE GIVING BIRTH?!?”

189 2018-09-18 23:37:26 Says the guy claiming the “facts” prove him right, and yet produces none.  The Canadian attempt at nationalizing the oil sands was a failure and ultimately lead to privatization anyway.  Oil operations require a specific set of skills that the government doesn’t possess.

222 2018-09-18 23:32:30 So easy. Melt 4 T of coconut oil, pour it over 1 cup sugar and mix. Add essential oils of your choice- I do 10 drops lavender and 10 drops lemon (but you could use different  oils if you had specific needs).
223 2018-09-18 23:32:29 Eh ako kaya? Sana oil haha.

If you’re so inclined, try breathing in cold mist with oregano or eucalyptus oil helps soothe your sinus’ too.

239 2018-09-18 23:29:57 Who else dislikes coconut oil?
240 2018-09-18 23:29:55 There's plenty in Venezuela! And the way that particular strain of Socialism has worked out(it failed and in oil rich country!? How do you do that?), they probably come with a "Buy one, get one free" deal!

Like, would that lower gas prices since we would be able to refine more here? Would that reduce our dependence on foreign oil?

We got home and she found some and proceeded to show me it and explain to me what it is, like I didn’t know. She seriously said “it’s for baking or frying things.” I know bitch, I bought it
258 2018-09-18 23:26:49 Anyone on board with taking Emu oil?

260 2018-09-18 23:26:21 Don't you love when you change the oil on your year old car, do nothing electronically to it, then go to start it and it gives you a big middle finger and doesnt start? Fugget stream starting soon lol how's your day going?!
261 2018-09-18 23:26:01 Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

267 2018-09-18 23:24:53 Great. Video, a bit too forgiving and even handed. How far back does the Barnet formula go? Maybe a full analysis of that whole period might be useful not just starting it immediately before the 80s oil revenues... even if we MUST accept it is Scotland’s oil anyway. Uk oil!
268 2018-09-18 23:24:45 Accountable revenue , doesnt include reclassified as British Exports Not Scottish , and of course oil of unknown origin.
269 2018-09-18 23:24:40 1978 the Europeans&UK signed an agreement with the arab nations over oil. To pretty it up they included work&study opportunities in the UK&Europe. Like they've used white south africans' land to get mining deals with the marxist ANC. They use brits property as chips with muslims
270 2018-09-18 23:24:27 People try hard to sell "data science" as a new snake oil sort of practice, and honesty is optional.

A BIG "online education company" which usually sells its courses for a symbolic price has had a "brilliant" idea to put up a DS challenge for their brazillian users...

273 2018-09-18 23:23:54 Once in the cab, he slowly and quietly opened the driver's side door, the door which opened not far from a stack of oil drums, behind which he could hide. As he snuck away, he was glad the building's cameras couldn't see him. This was no time for a close up.
274 2018-09-18 23:23:53 An economic boycott of the USA against Venezuela (judt like Nixon against Chile), trying to undermine a government that is not a US puppet, because Venezuela has a lot of oil.

284 2018-09-18 23:22:50 There’s ample reason not to be dependent of foreign powers for oil/natural gas. Pick exporting country carefully. No reason yet again to tax the crap out of folks and have energy rates skyrocket. Thorium plants could help. Much much cheaper too.
285 2018-09-18 23:22:42 Just got an oil change. Visited my hoe ass gramma. Bought dinner for my thot ass mama and her other children. Now finally heading back to the eastside. Away fron all these mosquitoes.
286 2018-09-18 23:22:39 oil!
287 2018-09-18 23:22:38 I used to take the hair/skin/nails, fish oil, MoveFree Joint health.  Along with pre workouts/post workouts con-cock-tions. 

I do feel like I had more energy then than I do now.  These days, I take One A Day women's occasionally, if I happen to think about it.
288 2018-09-18 23:22:34 ARs should be cleaned every 700 rounds. It really only takes some rem oil, and a toothbrush. 
You can push AK for several thousand without cleaning.
But, accuracy difference is quite notable. Even on single shot, the AK starts vibrating excessively before bullet has exited barrel

308 2018-09-18 23:19:13 Yeah so in the end there's really no point if your aim is to discourage people from using oil and gas.
309 2018-09-18 23:18:54 put a stop to ALL fishing in BC. this is as harmful as oil tankers running into whales.

315 2018-09-18 23:17:00 We should be doing more, not less, to keep dangerous greenhouse gases out of our atmosphere & reverse the impact of climate change on our environment—if for no other reason than we should care more about people & public health than increasing profits for Big Oil & Gas.

323 2018-09-18 23:15:40 Maybe. Though, this was easy. Uncase breakfast sausage, sauté up in the pot, remove when brown and a little crispy. Don’t drain the oil. Add an onion (chopped), 3 cloves of garlic (minced), sauté until transluscent. Add about 1/2cup stock, scrape up bits at bottom.

331 2018-09-18 23:14:07 China can only retaliate against LNG in the short term.  The long term, China needs the LNG markets they can access.  The easiest way for China to balance trade with U.S. is to buy more oil and gas, which they need anyways.  China/Korea will buy LNG Canada gas regardless imo.
332 2018-09-18 23:13:59 I love the way you talk about Obama I really do keep doing it mr.

333 2018-09-18 23:13:46 BYW, it looks to me like all the money is funding the climate hysteria.   

Find me a single example of an oil company funding a right wing climate cause. 

Just one.  From anywhere in the world. 

I’m gonna mix a drink, and wait for it...

338 2018-09-18 23:12:28 Today my mom drove me to Firestone to pick up my car after an oil change. After I spent about 10 minutes in the shop paying and talking to the mechanic, I came out to find my mom in the parking lot. She waited to make sure “I could figure out which car was mine”
339 2018-09-18 23:12:24 @GasBuddyDan just wondering if you get paid by the oil companies to warn  the public on Gas increases. USA has been buying our oil for decades. If we sold our oil worldwide ,we still wouldn't see a decrease in gas prices here. They are too greedy.
340 2018-09-18 23:12:22 Because, mon frere, they accidentally organized themselves where there was mucho oil, so obviously they decided it was God’s will, and bc people will pay mucho for said oil, they decided God wants them to fuck over other peoples and so they get the mucho money bc of “God’s will”

428 2018-09-18 23:00:36 Can you critically think about who attacked NY? Someone taught me how to otherwise I wouldn't have been able to and it has been Japan and we did have to go get oil first so Iraq is ours and Japan still plans another attack.

470 2018-09-18 22:55:30 Hey I'm all for what your saying but why do you have such hate for all Canadians? I recall a poll in Ontario tha had over 85% approval for the pipeline and getting our oil from Canada only....were with you bro
471 2018-09-18 22:55:26 This is weird but I used to mix coconut oil, honey, an egg, and vegetable oil and my hair grew so much and it felt so healthy after I washed it out. I just left it in for like 5 hours or I’d put it in at night and sleep with it!
472 2018-09-18 22:55:21 they're new trick is labeling it "vegetable oil" I hate it

514 2018-09-18 22:49:03 Damn. That totally sucks. Trump certainly did a number on the EPA. I was very glad to see his oil barren director, Scott Pruitt step down. It kills me to think that companies hire environmental experts to defeat the regs.
515 2018-09-18 22:48:59 Okay, cool

Reason I ask about the oil is when a head gasket goes you'll either get oil in the coolant or coolant in oil- which will make your oil look like a chocolate-milky substance.

Blown head gaskets can also cause overheating if dumping hot oil into coolant

558 2018-09-18 22:43:48 About half-way through 2006, Lego started phasing out brown from Bionicle either because they thought brown toys sold the most poorly, or because the color of brown plastic they used was too expensive to produce after the oil crisis. Or Both?

564 2018-09-18 22:43:00 Like skin grafts are used for scars all the time, esp. burn scars. One of my mutuals had them, and my cousin was badly burned in an oil fire. And like, this guy is here smugly mocking skin grafts because of the skin graft's purpose. He's such a tool.

569 2018-09-18 22:42:04 Price discovery through endless fake monopoly money isn’t really true price discovery tho just like modern crony capitalism isn’t real free market if so subsidized crude oil, cotton, corn, soybeans would all be replaced by hemp for example
570 2018-09-18 22:41:58 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the at the crossroads with the knife!
571 2018-09-18 22:41:55 Ati what?? Give as a break. How can someone confuse a water well(source) from oil reservoir. Jameni, what are we smoking as a nation?
572 2018-09-18 22:41:40 Todo es posible en esta vida, el ejemplo lo tenemos con la unidad de nuestro pueblo Quienes apoyaron cuando Cardenas Nacionalizó la industria del Oil&Gas...? Quienes brindaron su apoyo desinteresado en el pasado #sismo19/9 ...? @AlfredoJalifeR_ @NachoRgz @lopezobrador_
573 2018-09-18 22:41:23 merci
574 2018-09-18 22:41:19 there is no way on gods green (although becoming less green every day) earth that bitumen, the oil export of alberta, could EVER displace the true crude oil of SA. bitumen is garbage and expensive to process, and destroys the land for hundreds of years to collect.

576 2018-09-18 22:41:11 Evening, I am the owner of Golden Oil Massage Therapy treatment for stretch marks.  My treatment is the only treatment out there. It gets rid of those unsightly marks.  I would love to do a collaboration with you. Please give me a chance. My treatment will defy science.
577 2018-09-18 22:41:10 The oil and gas industry sparks no patriotism in my heart.  It's a dirty industry threatening our well being, delaying meaningful action on climate change and made choices to line their own wallet exporting raw material rather than refining it here.
578 2018-09-18 22:41:04 Chopped up into some poh-tay-toes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, and some smoked paprika... :9
579 2018-09-18 22:40:59 skincare routine now basically:

-wash with african black soap
-clean with diluted tea tree oil spray
-exfoliate with salicylic acid
-dermaroll on face (twice a week)
-minoxidil treatment
-moisturizer with SPF
580 2018-09-18 22:40:49 when you applied coconut oil did you just sit shirtless for a little while until it absorbed? i just hate applying that stuff bc it gets on everything

583 2018-09-18 22:40:17 I came to Honda to get my oil changed and why the guy that I was talking to to tell I need to get my oil changed started hitting on me ? I’m just here to do adult shit . Leave me alone

585 2018-09-18 22:40:15 When your largest source of income is cut in half.    Corruption exists in every country.   Venezuela is an oil exporting country.    Like Canada, they are disproportionately affected when oil prices fall.

And I'm done arguing with you.    You have google.   Use it.
586 2018-09-18 22:40:12 Try some witch hazel, rubbing alcohol, or baby oil.

589 2018-09-18 22:39:46 From what I see, climate change is being denied/suppressed by big business, big oil. Of course we should stop burning fossil fuels right now. We may be at or near the tipping point. But they won’t stop, on their own, until every last barrel is pumped out of the ground and burned.
590 2018-09-18 22:39:44 @AValiavska An example of the evaluative approach could be a gas company announcing their plan for their oil spill, and me analyzing the problem they are voicing and deciding if their plan is quality or not. #COMM3460 #OrgAd7
591 2018-09-18 22:39:03 I love fruit 'incorporated' things but not actual fruit. T-shirt with watermelons? cute i'll wear it! Raspberry shampoo? yas stunning smell. Strawberry milkshake? delsih. Coconut milk/oil/hand cream? Gimme now. But offer me an apple and i'd loaf it at your head before eating it.

593 2018-09-18 22:38:49 Have you ever driven a car instead of biking? Oil is cheap and so are aws instances 
594 2018-09-18 22:38:36 There’s the frattastic foolish blundering lead-me-to-war-and-I’ll-start-two-to-avenge-my-dad-and-help-cheney-boy-get-that-oil dude we all remember. With a dollop of rape countenancing on top.
595 2018-09-18 22:38:33 - Micellar water to remove my makeup (don't like oil cleansers) 
- Neogen's Super Cereal Facial Wash for a double cleanse
- Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner
- CORSX Snail 96% Mucin Power Essence
- Klairs Rich Moisture Serum
- Klairs Rich Moisture cream

My eye cream varies.
596 2018-09-18 22:38:30 It was like the paper soaked up the butter/oil, went from whitish  to cloudy window-like. The paper stuck to the cake.
597 2018-09-18 22:38:21 コレクション要素もあるしすごく高くつきそう
598 2018-09-18 22:38:15 Cheerfully withdrawn.  The oil industry had their chance 30 years ago.
599 2018-09-18 22:38:11 essential oils! It’s one called pms relief (not sure the blend:/) and I mix it with coconut oil and rub it on my lower tummy. The cramps don’t go completely away but it definitely helps.
600 2018-09-18 22:38:05 I greased this with oil.
601 2018-09-18 22:38:03 @NatGeoMag  Your profile picture so sad to see this When will man  Lean that the earth is for all of us and with out Nature he are nothing grapes can be turned into win but oil can't be turned in to Water and so much garbage in our saes .
602 2018-09-18 22:38:01 The key to okra for gumbo or any stew is to cook it at a fairly high heat with the oil and onions etc. ( or roux if you want that ) until it no longer makes strings as you stir it. Then it's like nopales ( not really, but go with it ).
603 2018-09-18 22:37:55 You are an ndper you don’t know how to listen.  $90 billion.  Who is going to pay it.   Are you going to pay more than your share.  Doubt it  You would cheer Notley on even if she set fire to every Alberta oil well.
604 2018-09-18 22:37:36 lemsip and olbas oil are gonna be my best friends for the next couple of days
605 2018-09-18 22:37:23 Bio oil, shea butter, and aloe vera works like a charm!
606 2018-09-18 22:37:15 It would kill off investment in a heart beat. The oil industry decommissioning would accelerate.

608 2018-09-18 22:37:01 Took too much cbd oil at work and I feel like a vaguely human shaped piece of slime
609 2018-09-18 22:36:47 mano, eu tô bocejando a cada 5min só de ficar olhando essa lista de Oil & Gas e ficar tirando o nome de empresa uma por uma, catando contato e e-mails, entrando nos sites, carai... ainda tô na letra O, e vai até o Z.... é hoje que chego em casa depois da meia noite.
610 2018-09-18 22:36:47 Are there anymore oil rich plastic clubs need twatting at Anfield? #UCL #LFC #PSG
611 2018-09-18 22:36:44 Energy East (RIP) was mostly for export and would not have displaced Saudi oil.  Energy East was approved.  TransCanada couldn't handle the pressure and pulled out.
612 2018-09-18 22:36:31 Fashion is the second largest polluter after the oil industry. This has to change. #CSI6degrees

615 2018-09-18 22:35:45 Couldn't agree more the NDP have been knifing the oil industry in the back while killing pipelines as fast as they can.
616 2018-09-18 22:35:36 やっていくぅ
617 2018-09-18 22:35:18 Krill oil, Royal jelly, collagen powder, black seed oil and Fenugreek.Those work wonders for me especially during the flu season.
618 2018-09-18 22:35:03 I need a long, relaxing shower. Where I just lather myself in some good smelling body wash, then get out and massage some oil all over myself.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
620 2018-09-18 22:34:50 I’m tired of getting synthetic oil this too much .
621 2018-09-18 22:34:47 Love this store! Great concept with unique items & an amazing staff! Olive Oil samples were really cool.
622 2018-09-18 22:34:26 求人数も増えてるし、時給も上がってます。安倍総理は結果出してますよ。
623 2018-09-18 22:34:08 It was a POS!! Topped out at about 90. Check the gas & fill up the oil, lol. God I was so stupid to get rid of my Silver Bullet but, I was 19 so, there ya have it.
624 2018-09-18 22:34:01 I'm sure there will be the odd "How will you solve IMMIGANT ILLEGILS BAD PEOPLE HERE?!" and a few "When will you stop making oil prices too low for the tar sands to compete?" as well.
625 2018-09-18 22:33:48 Well Trader Joe’s organic Mayonnaise is made with soybean oil (organic)
626 2018-09-18 22:33:38 Ancient Greek wrestlers used oil, she’s working her way to the whole body.
627 2018-09-18 22:33:38 あいてるよ
628 2018-09-18 22:33:25 Good question and yes.  Building refineries and upgraders is so expensive it takes decades to pay off.  Maybe, if they made them in the 1980s we could have a discussion about who's oil to buy.  At this point, it's way too late.
629 2018-09-18 22:33:24 ...2) 7-13 Jesus gives authority to students to drive demons out and to take only what they need (the point is to encourage faith). They drove out many demons and healed people through anointing oil.
14 Implies Herod already killed John the Baptist (or he already died somehow) -
630 2018-09-18 22:33:19 I gotta try that baby oil shit 
631 2018-09-18 22:33:09 A drizzle of olive oil, generous salt and pepper, and 10-20 minutes (they vary in size so much) at 375 degrees will make them a crispy, delicious alternative to thinking about bad genitals.
632 2018-09-18 22:32:54 Mustard oil is gooddddd
633 2018-09-18 22:32:47 Yes,gh have gold , silver, oil , diamond , timber etc , but still we borrow . Is it becos our leaders don't manage well or what ?
634 2018-09-18 22:32:42 Finally got an oil change. I feel like a new person
635 2018-09-18 22:32:38 うーないすぅ！！
636 2018-09-18 22:32:25 I thought that the oil company in Venezuela was staffed with political sycophants and were not producing large amounts of oil.
637 2018-09-18 22:32:07 Haha! "Mathematical snake oil" is very fitting
638 2018-09-18 22:32:07 What did you replace the butter with? I've used coconut oil to make keto break, which was basically cornbread
639 2018-09-18 22:32:06 @realDonaldTrump #OPEC oil revenues are up 29% from last year. What is @SecretaryPerry doing to keep our gas and #oilprices low??? Ask him!!!
640 2018-09-18 22:31:46 I think pork rinds are fine, a lot of people use them as breading.  (fried in olive or avocado oil of course) Ashley I would stay away from fruit for a atleast 6 weeks and then make it a dessert or occasional snack.  Berries have the least sugar, tropical fruits are much worse.
641 2018-09-18 22:31:30 Pineapple Cookies oil really hit the spot 
642 2018-09-18 22:31:25 That palm oil hit different 
643 2018-09-18 22:31:23 Long way to go though. In 2017 UK generated about 340TWh of elec with 30% being renewable. In total we used about 840TWh Nat gas and another 800TWh of oil. The whole EU didn't generate enough renew elec (650TWh) to cover just the UKs Nat gas use.
644 2018-09-18 22:31:15 流石にその価格ではなぁ
645 2018-09-18 22:31:09 WHAT HAPPENED IN HISTORY
America to control oil, put corrupt regimes in
into power who then oppressed their own citizens .
This caused a flood of immigrants into the West only to be greeted by controls separating children from parents etc as bad as the evils of the Nazis in WWII.
646 2018-09-18 22:31:00 Lady this fiasco has nothing to do with sexual abuse and all about stalling and derailing a Supreme Court appointment. Everyone knows that regardless of party affiliation. Do you really think the American public is that stupid?
647 2018-09-18 22:30:57 Then take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, anointing him. Then bring his sons, put tunics on them and gird them with sashes, both Aaron and his sons, and set hats on them.
648 2018-09-18 22:30:49 Who elsa know about coconut oil as a sex lube lmao ive heard it all now
649 2018-09-18 22:30:49 What about all the spare electricity we will have when we stop refining crude oil? It takes a huge amount of electricity to make crude into petrol.
You need to join up your thinking as you say.
650 2018-09-18 22:30:44 niggas project so much that I sell drugs that I be like "I got that chicken with the oil on the STOVE" n mfs AUTOMATICALLY think Im talkin bout COKE n CRACK COCAINE wen Im LITERALLY talkin bout COOKIN FRIED CHICKEN
651 2018-09-18 22:30:40 okay so Hanukkah all you need to know is the oil was only supposed to last for one night but it lasted for eight so fucking yippee ki yay now we celebrate for eight days and eight nights and that’s why the menorah looks the way it does
652 2018-09-18 22:30:37 These r stealing from the people my dad was fellow in St Anthony Oxford founded opec first meeting was in 1960 in Baghdad and he nationalised the oil from unused
The Kurdish regional government magia awared the contracts no to get money for them leave people starving

655 2018-09-18 22:30:27 I just like my mum. So, I casually mention that there's no difference between someone who rubs anointing oil on the forehead before going out for an interview and another who uses TIIRO. We argue back and forth and she agrees that it's the same thing.
656 2018-09-18 22:30:25 チョコエッグまだ安かったけど今紹介してるやつ2000円近くするんだけど
657 2018-09-18 22:30:19 I think it's reasonably clear that somebody is lying to you. I'm not sure why you think it's us. It's not like we're as rich as, say, oil barons.

 I can't answer your "why" because I doubt it's true.
658 2018-09-18 22:30:02 Another option: boil a pan of pasta. Fry off some mushrooms with some onions and a stock cube. Drain the pasta once cooked. Add the mushrooms. Stir thoroughly. Drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Stir again. Serve. Joyously simple but really nice.
659 2018-09-18 22:29:59 Oil Christine Blazy forward your whole life is a lie. You cannot be trusted. I’m sure the FBI is looking into your bank finance was to see how much you’re being paid.

Don;t be ridiculous.
662 2018-09-18 22:29:32 Has anyone done the coconut oil on hair/eyelashes and actually seen a growth difference?
663 2018-09-18 22:29:29 Treat it with several coats Osmo Wood Protector followed by several coats of Osmo Top Oil. That will make it last beautifully. (I think that's the order. I can check for you)
664 2018-09-18 22:28:57 They've been doing this for awhile. GOP operative Frank Lutz makes a living out of it -- testing language and finding words to help the GOP turn public opinion. He renamed the estate tax as death tax; global warming became climate change; oil drilling became energy exploration.
665 2018-09-18 22:28:49 I cannot believe it took me so long to get into the oil cleansing method. My face loves me again and I can now go out in public without mountains of concealer
666 2018-09-18 22:28:45 B/c of the tea tree oil?
667 2018-09-18 22:28:43 Their crude oil is so low grade that refineries don't like to process it. People in government will steal the money anyway. Might make a good show.
668 2018-09-18 22:28:33 Turn that doubt and uncertainty into worship, the fear and anxiety. 
It always gets more unbearable and exhausting at the edge of the breakthrough, but you can't afford to run out of oil. 

Worship.
669 2018-09-18 22:28:32 || It's currently my most detailed on-going which is why I want to make sure I'm in the right mindset when replying. Don't slip on all that oil, babe.

674 2018-09-18 22:27:36 That is a good point. Plus they put cotton seed oil in mayonnaise, margarine and some pasta sauces.

679 2018-09-18 22:26:51 I'm not saying gender dysphoria can be cured, no more than many psychiatric conditions can. I'm simply saying that the "trans" snake oil, doesn't work and regrettably suicide rates prove that.
My bigger issue is you conflating it with homosexuality. Again there is no connection.
680 2018-09-18 22:26:47 I never saw a single one of those things he gives as examples. I give Anderson credit for coming to Nashville during the 2010 floods when nobody talked about anything but the oil spill. CNN has lost much of its following in the last 8 years. Soul search time.
681 2018-09-18 22:26:43 Get an oil change asap lol
682 2018-09-18 22:26:36 #CarloMarxBot: "Moloch whose jobs are steel spectacle! Moloch whose oil is unnatural cyborg!" wrote it first, man. Stop stealing!
683 2018-09-18 22:26:29 Not at all. Murkowski voted gleefully to open the Alaskan wilderness to permanent drilling. The influence of Native voters is overrated. Murkowski could easily retire if she wants and will become rich beyond her dreams. She delivered what no Man ever did - Alaskan oil! 
684 2018-09-18 22:26:24 The baking industry? Big enough that someone in it will sell gay cakes, but not so big that it looks appetising for nationalisation and corrupt evisceration by illiterate socialists, like Venezuelan oil.
685 2018-09-18 22:26:09 Yet again the US is playing its usual part in trying to overthrow a South American government. And this one is for high stakes, the biggest oil reserves in the world.
686 2018-09-18 22:25:59 Oil Sands attribute 0.1% of global emissions. From 2000 to 2016 the emission intensity dropped by approx. 29% as a result of technological and efficiency improvements, fewer venting emissions and reductions in the percentage of crude bitumen being upgraded to synthetic crude oil.
687 2018-09-18 22:25:05 “TM affects us like everyone else…but the entrepreneurship that we bring to the table-these sml service firms & ma-&-pa co's & the jobs they add-have been hurt significantly. & I don’t think anyone has spoken out for that”

688 2018-09-18 22:24:59 I made Chinese "seaweed" tonight. Finely shredded sweetheart cabbage, tosed in oil and spices and baked quickly. Damn good. And a fraction of the cost of the same thing from the Chineses takeaway.
689 2018-09-18 22:24:59 Business idea: Vaping motorized scooters that dispense CBD oil. Downtown Indy would never be the same.
690 2018-09-18 22:24:50 Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT's) products. Our oils are simple, once your mind receives a trigger to smoke a cigarette. You will just apply the fragrance oil to your skin and let the oil do its work. We help people slow up on smoking
691 2018-09-18 22:24:26 This is some seriously good stuff, your snake oil.
692 2018-09-18 22:24:16 I found a place that do it for $35 full synthetic oil change and tire rotation sis 
693 2018-09-18 22:24:12 Anyone take CBD oil for anxiety? I think my Venlafaxine aren't doing the job they used to? Has anyone had this?? It has been a few years but upped to the max dosage this year??? #Anxiety #MedHelp???
694 2018-09-18 22:24:09 This is the dude that owns the oil rigs right
695 2018-09-18 22:23:58 If your house insurance was null and void without a GSR cert for your appliances, AND a service record, it wouldn't take many published accounts of no payouts against a claim to get people to sit up and listen. Same for oil,  solid fuel and electrical
696 2018-09-18 22:23:40 my new home brew is just crab meat and olive oil sealed into an 18 oz bottle and if you dont drink it all you arent a real beer guy

705 2018-09-18 22:22:47 Oil painting literally. Die
706 2018-09-18 22:22:39 The #CorruptGOP and #CorruptTrump administration might work for oil and gas, but they SHOULD work for Americans. We need to vote them all out then investigate and jail the corrupt officials.

I hope you're ashamed of your anti-American corruption.
707 2018-09-18 22:22:26 You and facts are like oil and water
Trump poo pooed the TPP so he wasn’t interested in fair then
He still isn’t 

Bye Felicia
708 2018-09-18 22:22:19 Maduro is a PUPPET of Putin's KGB, that's everyone knows. Even the last 2-3 years Venezuela openly lives on direct tranches from russian federal budget (for exchange Maduro gives away almost all oil industry to russian KGB-oil corporations). Putin never understands ultimatums.
709 2018-09-18 22:22:13 Emissions are not a problem as the oil sands have lost 90 billion since China walked away from contracts and investments and the remaining yearly 36 billion to follow by late 2019 - Carbon Tax when complete will cost a family of 4 $4000 after tax per year.
710 2018-09-18 22:22:10 ...the extensive opportunities he has had in life. That brings his time at (and perhaps after) CBN into focus working as Deputy G’nor in different capacities. What impact(s) did he make? At the time, we’re sitting on a huge Govt debt (>$32Bn). Oil prices were at record highs.
711 2018-09-18 22:22:05 That was back when the Shah was in power and Iran was an ally to the US. And acted as a buffer keeping the USSR away from the oil fields. Great pic!
712 2018-09-18 22:22:01 Getting those oil contracts with a million collateral damage seems a small price to pay 
713 2018-09-18 22:21:57 Moloch whose jobs are steel spectacle! Moloch whose oil is unnatural cyborg!
714 2018-09-18 22:21:31 The petroleum industry is a global industry. It might not be directly affected by ph inflation rates. But the global oil trade directly affects it.
715 2018-09-18 22:21:29 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.

719 2018-09-18 22:21:22 Got in to my car after work to a washed car, full tank of gas, and oil change. 
720 2018-09-18 22:21:20 US/Saudi pumped oil to depress prices, to affect Russia, Venezuela and other oil producing countries.

Venezuela wouldn't be where they are now if oil prices had collapsed.   

And about those sanctions.......
721 2018-09-18 22:21:17 WTI Oil …. The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a build of 1.25 million barrels of United States crude oil inventories for the week ending September 14 @jonnajarian @CNBCFastMoney @CNBCFuturesNow @ScottNations
722 2018-09-18 22:21:15 Did someone ever cried upon lead-acid batteries? Or the cobalt needed for the steel to supply refineries to produce oil? 
So just tell me, what’s wrong with you all putting up this shot now? 
Lithium can be found everywhere. Find salt, find also lithium salt. That easy.
723 2018-09-18 22:20:55 Do u even knows how oil prices changes ??
724 2018-09-18 22:20:49 Every fund manager still in $tsla will have to explain to their clients someday why they didn't take the opportunity to sell to these knucklehead fanboys when @tesla problems became obvious. Pretty sure their investors are not going to accept "Oil company conspiracy" as an excuse
725 2018-09-18 22:20:32 نصير شكلك غيران من الفلوس اللي عندنا بالخليج وخصوصا السعودية
We are rich we have oil and much billions of mony 
726 2018-09-18 22:20:28 Price changes for Thursday, Sept.20th, 2018: Heating/stove oils to decrease by 1.4 cents a litre. Diesel to drop by 1.2 cents a litre. Gasoline shows a drop of 6/10ths of a cent a litre. Canadian $ up a penny from last week. Oil relatively stable around $78 U.S a barrel.
727 2018-09-18 22:20:20 In middle school a classmates sister told us that an employee at a restaurant was caught flopping his dick around in cooked penne pasta, like tossing his dick and the penne in olive oil together or something like that.
728 2018-09-18 22:20:19 went to get an oil change and in the ten minutes it took to drive there I saw a 2001 raised corolla w pink rims and a sticker that said swamp Barbie then an Acura with an infowars sticker something abt fluoride being poison and a trump 2k16 sticker I hate this place so fucking
729 2018-09-18 22:20:06 Quite. Dhimmi system is their only form of revenue generation; conquest being the mode of production. Without oil to sell, Islam would simply have been left behind in feudalistic societies by the technological advances made in mostly western nations.
730 2018-09-18 22:19:52 it is a marry between media and oil. It has global connections
731 2018-09-18 22:19:44 2) The carbon levy rebate program also now defeats the purpose of actually discouraging people to use oil and gas. It only discourages the use of oil for families with income above 100,000/year, which is what, 2% of the population? Yeah that'll help fight climate change.
732 2018-09-18 22:19:37 Yes there were sanctions but that was not the main issue. Chavez allowed PDVSA to wither because it did not have enough capital to maintain its production. As oil production declined and then the price fell financial collapse was inevitable. Skilled workers deserted the company.
733 2018-09-18 22:19:31 How so if we avoid Brexit, illegal war, and nuclear weapons to name but 3 positives,  and that's before we start taxing the oil  (currently 0%) to something closer to Norwegian levels  (70~%)
734 2018-09-18 22:19:23 this guy at brake check just asked if i wanted to go get a beer... look man i just want my oil changed okay?
735 2018-09-18 22:19:20 We need an energy industry that invests in clean, renewable energy rather than wringing the land dry with toxic filth. Stop acting like oil and gas are the only possible energy options, you vile human beings
736 2018-09-18 22:19:04 I think it's possible, and with Ben working on that bike its possible he may have handled a flammable can of fluid or oil can that could have his fingerprint on it, and Tripp just happened to come upon it. I think Hope is the red herring for sure.

749 2018-09-18 22:16:48 Do you need some oil for your shopping trolley love? I hear special brew works wonders. Don't forget discarded pizza boxes are a good source of food.
750 2018-09-18 22:15:58 My antagonism toward the media pre-dates Trump by 30 years.

Not that your point isn't valid and I realize the plural of anecdote isn't data however I'd assert this antagonism is why he won

753 2018-09-18 22:15:40 ‘Gender dysphoria’, Keith, sounds like you’re doing what generations did about homosexuality, by reducing it to some sort of medical condition that can be ‘cured’. 
If kids avoid the ‘snake oil’, they won’t be ‘infected’. 
Shame on you.
754 2018-09-18 22:15:35 Unpopular opinion: in our field (lean/agile tech), words like “scientific” and “empirical” have been (ab)used so generously that they have lost most value & your snake oil detector should be on overdrive if you see them used. 
We’re at best where social science was 100 years ago!
755 2018-09-18 22:15:34 The fact that @DawnDish has to produce TV ads showing how great they are at cleaning wildlife safely after #oilspills demonstrates how bad of a #designfail #oil is to use for energy. 

#renewables #renewableenergy
756 2018-09-18 22:15:26 I didn't know Coventry struck oil!
757 2018-09-18 22:15:06 We bought in with our collective public oil rights, like our 6.2% SS withholdings. 

Also: we have no collective control on production.
758 2018-09-18 22:14:59 No. Oil. I painted it in high school.
759 2018-09-18 22:14:50 i left early remember ? i had to get my oil changed and go to my oral surgeon
760 2018-09-18 22:14:40 shes way nicer than me
761 2018-09-18 22:14:40 What a beast~ A very cool fursona~!
762 2018-09-18 22:14:29 Very aware. That’s why we need oil produced by a country that has strict environmental regulations, carbon cap, carbon tax, continued R&D in reducing emissions and GHG. That country is Canada, which you actively protest. Instead the void is filled by foreign energy with less 1/2
763 2018-09-18 22:14:24 So apparently putting oil in your car isn’t the same as getting your oil changed. My dad so mad at me
764 2018-09-18 22:14:20 Thought you were supposed to rub the oil on??
765 2018-09-18 22:14:18 She loves Putin and oil.  If you think otherwise, U are delusional.
766 2018-09-18 22:14:16 This just hit my spirit for somebody...

770 2018-09-18 22:13:02 Quit wasting oil. Babies need those to stay soft.
771 2018-09-18 22:12:56 Lol I just know you got the type of oil that make a cry fly  cause that’s too much for a oil change.
772 2018-09-18 22:12:56 Evening, like to introduce myself as the owner of Golden Oil Massage therapy for stretch marks.  The treatment guarantees to remove those unsightly marks.  I would like a chance to prove science wrong. Please give me a chance.

776 2018-09-18 22:12:35 So there isn’t a SINGLE house for sale in our budget/location that meets our criteria.

2. 1.5+ baths
3. Not oil heat

But I mean, millennials and their entitlement destroying the housing market, amiright??

782 2018-09-18 22:12:08 Been diffusing peppermint oil in my room for days in preparation for big spider season  everything might smell like a chewing gum wrapper but I swear I'm not playing around this year
783 2018-09-18 22:12:05 If it still boils after re-filling you could have a head gasket issue.

What does your coolant look like right now? Also, what does your oil look like?
784 2018-09-18 22:12:05 I used to think Trump Jr put oil in his hair. Today, I realized it's slime.
785 2018-09-18 22:12:02 Peppermint oil from Sage! Work
786 2018-09-18 22:12:00 That's enough to cover my car repairs, new tires, an oil change and elventy boxes of wine.
787 2018-09-18 22:11:49 Of course he does, he has done nothing but deny their is even such a thing as climate change. He's too busy lining the pockets of big corporations, oil, coal etc.

791 2018-09-18 22:11:23 True! theyre oils made from plants such as Canola oil (aka rapeseed oil), Sunflower oil, Cottonseed oil etc. hint Crisco and the like. 

Oils/fats from fruit and nuts (Olive, coconut, avocado, macadamia etc.) and animals are the ones I use. Healthier AND they taste better. 
792 2018-09-18 22:11:02 The best forecaster is Dsarin on VZ credit event moderated  as the price of bailout clear, Unlike UKR which is getting 35-billion IMF eventually the cost of VZ oil is the entire country.

803 2018-09-18 22:09:41 I'm just imagining Islamophobic Brexiteers trying to sell things to Saudi Arabia for oil. 

Don't think Saudi Princes are going to hand over billions of petrodollars of oil for a loud fuss about "uncontrolled h'imigration"
804 2018-09-18 22:09:34 I hate waiting for an oil change

809 2018-09-18 22:09:11 Yeah they are out to get our money one way or another. Next mission should you choose to accept it:  changing your own oil. Good news is that is something even I can do!!
810 2018-09-18 22:09:06 The GOP energy policy is to give tax breaks to oil companies and do away with any incentives for clean energy such as wind turbines.
811 2018-09-18 22:09:04 I can't think straight until my new oil diffuser comes in the mail.
812 2018-09-18 22:08:33 Yes, I've used that too... comes out the same any type of grain is the best, but the capers make the taste unbelievable... With the olive oil I just add a few splashes of balsamic vinegar and one little splash of lemon juice also

844 2018-09-18 22:02:42 During my 4 yrs of AF service I lived the core values of: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. How did you go from that to selling out your constituents to Big Oil, selling off our public lands, and slaughtering our wild horses? #bluewave2018 #bye
845 2018-09-18 22:02:33 @realDonaldTrump It should not be allowed to add this regimen to shameful life for six months. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and OPEC should be ready for a full boycott of Iran's oil in November; they must finish this diabolical regime in November.
846 2018-09-18 22:02:27 It needs to only allow myself to sit on it. Should anyone else try to sit on it, it must eject them. It must also be easy to oil.
847 2018-09-18 22:02:22 Oh, come on. I have followed this and Chavez and Maduro totally mismanaged their economy. Let us get away from conspiracy theories and look at reality. You don't kill the goose that lays the golden oil revenues while spending like drunken sailors and survive.
848 2018-09-18 22:02:19 I’ll Say Upwards To 5 Days. Like Now I Have Twists In My Hair. I Use Water As My Liquid So I’ll Mist My Hair Lightly Whenever I’m Adding Oil To My Hair/Scalp. I Really Don’t Use Cream/Conditioner Unless It’s When I First Do My Hair B/C Shrinkage
849 2018-09-18 22:02:03 Gideon, go and buy beard oil from Joro 
850 2018-09-18 22:01:54 Like water and oil
851 2018-09-18 22:01:22 Looks due for an oil change anyway.
852 2018-09-18 22:01:22 Do you need to wash your face every night? You definitely should try. Washing your face removes the day’s makeup, dirt, oil, and dead skin cells.

854 2018-09-18 22:00:44 @realDonaldTrump It should not be allowed to extend the sanctions on oil for another six months, it should not be allowed to continue killing and terrorism for another six months; it should not allow more blood to be shed for another six months.
855 2018-09-18 22:00:31 They tried me the oil change place  I’m so glad Dee answered the phone

861 2018-09-18 21:59:54 Yes the sound economics of maintaining Venezuelan sovereignty by not bowing to oil desperate countries. Take a look at the sanctions and coups we've enacted to get to that oil. The US gov doesn't care about hungry, sick, or dying people. Look at Yemen. We are arming murderers
862 2018-09-18 21:59:50 I fried a cod filet last week. Soak in milk. Dip in egg. Panko it. Fry in a little olive oil.
863 2018-09-18 21:59:43 It comes with growth as u get older love don’t worry, but if u really want to do something about them bio oil is really the way to go! Highly recommend :)) u can find it in ur local pharmacies 
864 2018-09-18 21:59:39 Alone oil
865 2018-09-18 21:59:22 Oh my, @Stockwell_Day giving more misinformation. 

Socialism didn't damage Venezuela.      Illegal US sanctions and Saudi Arabia/US pumping more oil, depressing oil prices.

Host should challenge panelists and know the file.   #pnpcbc
866 2018-09-18 21:59:14 Doesn't matter what colour they are, they all bleed oil
867 2018-09-18 21:59:08 And I don’t own no oil field
868 2018-09-18 21:59:05 The "Big Oil" conspiracy is my favorite.  Every cult leader needs an enemy to distract his/her followers from his/her failures.
869 2018-09-18 21:59:04 One of my roommates in college ribbed olive oil on her hands every night. #doyouknowhowthatsounds
870 2018-09-18 21:58:48 Companies such as this and Google need to be busted up. Teddy Roosevelt and the courts did that to John D Rockefeller and Standard Oil.
871 2018-09-18 21:58:45 Our hemp oil is made with certified organic hemp grown in Spain and is certified free of all contaminants, Herbicide, and Fungicide. Internationally sourced CBD is protected under a different legal code than the US Farm Bill. The code is 2004 legal ruling in the case HIA vs. DEA.
872 2018-09-18 21:58:45 Just released 7 batches of rec oil!  And so it begins...
873 2018-09-18 21:57:57 Dang it. I've had hot oil hit my eye that hurt less than today
874 2018-09-18 21:57:55 Desperately balancing out my deep dislike of liverpool vs my hatred of Oligarch/oil money football teams.
875 2018-09-18 21:57:41 If you go any lower than this, you’d probably find oil reserves. Shame on your filthy journalism
876 2018-09-18 21:57:32 So why were you protesting oil and gas industry?
877 2018-09-18 21:57:32 But then muh oil
878 2018-09-18 21:57:31 This was actually pretty fun, showing oil lighter than water.  Add some alka seltzer and red dye, and you got yourself a lava cycle in the Earth's crust!
879 2018-09-18 21:57:27 Hold up - why would Saudi Arabia invest in anything that competes with the internal combustion engine - unless, of course, they're hedging their bet on oil

880 2018-09-18 21:57:25 Note to everyone: no matter how stupid the question, for example; "how do I set the temperature on this oil bath?", always ask... because I just accidentally heated an oil bath to 270°C when I only wanted 130°C and when I came back to it, it was smoking... so yeah. Always ask._.
881 2018-09-18 21:57:18 Ok really though how many miles can you go over without changing ur oil?
I think my work truck is going to blow any minute lol

887 2018-09-18 21:56:18 Shameless arrogance by an industry that thinks the brakes are off and government oversight is ancient history. Certainly correct re. the former at the Federal level. But, in the long run, the pendulum will swing back and smack Big Oil & Gas in the ass.

892 2018-09-18 21:55:37 Imagine how astounding our present could be if 20th century oil barons were willing to accept science, invest, and move away from coal and oil? We stalled. Some improvement to refining occurred, but no genuine innovation.
893 2018-09-18 21:54:30 You are committed to energy diversity? Or just different sources of oil?
894 2018-09-18 21:54:30 Mederma scar gel! Or the quick dry oil. It works well. If not, coconut oil lightened my marks a little but mederma is making them go away!
895 2018-09-18 21:54:12 And if I tell you how much we pay for electricity bill per month, you won't believe it. Plus additional expenditure to run and maintain a generator.. And we export crude oil and import petrol.. Abeg, our problems too much
896 2018-09-18 21:53:39 Was it on public land that you and Zinke are attempting to lease out to big oil?

@realDonaldTrump
897 2018-09-18 21:53:38 Ironically that sounds like Castro in the Foro de São Paulo using Chavez and Vzla oil money to fund this disaster!!!  Omg  goes to prove the strings that “mecen la Cuna” are those who rock it in their favor. Unbelievable!

900 2018-09-18 21:53:23 As of right now you pretty much have to be on your death bed to get it and even then it’s just the oil  but hopefully next year we will get to vote on legalizing it!
901 2018-09-18 21:53:21 This Gain scented oil is potent and I don’t feel I like blowing the candle out  it smell good but it’s to much
902 2018-09-18 21:53:18 A Member of Parliament was elected for a party who wants to shut down oil production.... in Alberta who has one economy, oil production!!! It can happen; people often vote  in ways that makes your head spin.
903 2018-09-18 21:52:51 News from #Asmra confirming points agreed by ONLF and ethiopia. Natural reasource sharing, implimenting oil project federal level power shsring are smingest those points.

915 2018-09-18 21:50:37 These would do wonders in oil pipelines
916 2018-09-18 21:50:30 I’ll have to sniff that one. I usually rock Beyonce Pulse oil when I want to smell good but not use all my good good.
917 2018-09-18 21:50:25 And I say that after having tried with bio oil, I recommend if u might want to reduce their size but it doesn’t make them go away and after a year or two realized that every woman has them and they all look great on them so i can learn to embrace them too 
918 2018-09-18 21:50:14 That being said, anyone know if Walmart sells oil diffusers because apparently they done know and just hang up on customers
919 2018-09-18 21:50:02 I'm trying. I do almost all of the cooking because my husband does all the dishes (I got the better part of that deal by far). I haven't gotten too complicated yet. We do have salt, pepper, and olive oil, though!
920 2018-09-18 21:49:27 Actually the government is supposed to work for all the people, promoting the general welfare, not subsidizing big oil gas so you can make billions off our resources.
921 2018-09-18 21:49:18 olive oil :0

928 2018-09-18 21:48:33 Nonsense!

@JustinTrudeau , @jimcarr_wpg and @Bill_Morneau have repeatedly said the #TMX is about making up this $15B / year that they think we’re missing out on by not exporting our oil to Asia. It has nothing to do with selling more to the US!

941 2018-09-18 21:46:42 We're not talking about schools here. We're talking about a teacher's professional organization hiring someone who was on the provincial oil sands environmental oversight committee, & who the industry leaders on that committee complimented for her work.

945 2018-09-18 21:46:21 The pollution on the North Slope of Alaska -- where oil drilling has occurred since the 1970's -- is negligent. That's enough evidence for me this is a non-issue. There is more pollution of our air by cigarette smokers than natural resources exploration. How about we fix that?
946 2018-09-18 21:46:20 yesterday @therealJCC23 changed my oil and filled my gas tank up and I’ll take that over flowers any day

961 2018-09-18 21:43:47 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

Russia has stopped the US car makers to take over the world market in the 70-ies. Just when the breakthrough was there the Russians raised the oil price; caused crisis. 
974 2018-09-18 21:42:22 Sounds so weird but if u use washing up liquid to wash ur hair like once a month, it gets rid of all the oil residues. It works wonders x

977 2018-09-18 21:42:08 Selfish dinos, didn't die in larger quantities (titties lol) to give us even more oil.
978 2018-09-18 21:42:07 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
979 2018-09-18 21:42:02 Lol good luck with that people were fooled last time into voting yes thinking they were getting shares in the oil. Mr Salmond said they'd all be getting £300,000 each. They've had 4 years to realise this was a lie.

982 2018-09-18 21:41:42 EZ shares +0.4%, US shares +0.5% (Nasdaq p 0.8%) as latest round of US tariffs on China and China retaliation were less than feared.

983 2018-09-18 21:41:38 Yes it definitely makes us look like morons for giving private industry control of our resources and being the only major oil exporting nation on earth not to nationalize the industry at all.

990 2018-09-18 21:40:08 Well, I hope it'll be enough but I doubt it. We're too busy spending money in unnecessary wars for oil. If that doesn't stop first, we'll never get where we need to be.
991 2018-09-18 21:40:06 It's not ruined at all.....Imma drive that bitch into the wall EVERY time....or have the princess hit it with the oil slick.....any number of things shall make my day....heheheheheheheheheh

992 2018-09-18 21:40:05 Why are you all so angry about what we do? I replied to an Everton fan who took a joke well and I’ve got all you oil rent boys in my mentions
993 2018-09-18 21:39:55 You will have to let me know how the CBD oil and the mints for anxiety.
994 2018-09-18 21:39:51 Today o got an oil change, replaced my wiper fluid, power steering fluid, and transmission fluid, and I changed my wipers. HMU for your (minor) mechanic needs
995 2018-09-18 21:39:48 CHANGE YOUR GODDAM AND MOTHERFUCKING OIL

997 2018-09-18 21:39:43 Chinese, buy Venezuela, and their OIL, we must stop them putting new bases in the Middle if America!
998 2018-09-18 21:39:38 Let baking soda sit on it. It might soak out the oil

1001 2018-09-18 21:39:00 Oh, don’t be ridiculous, Keith. How old were you when you knew you were gay? Was it before or after you took the snake oil?
1002 2018-09-18 21:38:37 いってきます～
1003 2018-09-18 21:38:35 Yup, making the oil companies rich.
1004 2018-09-18 21:38:26 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

1006 2018-09-18 21:38:12 Oil???  Did someone say oil???  Like the stuff america is addicted to and can't get enough of and invades countries to "protect" their oil???  You mean that kinda oil???
1007 2018-09-18 21:38:11 Yeah mine is super slow too. I bought castor oil today though - apparently that speeds it up. You massage it into your scalp. x
1008 2018-09-18 21:38:05 Subsiding the oil company’s and keeping an already bloated military budget excessively high to keep that oil flowing is just one example of corporate welfare.
Paying corporate farms not to grow produce is ridiculous.
republicans are guilty of corporate socialism, while killing us

1010 2018-09-18 21:37:45 So oil affecting the airlines industry in turn affecting companies like Accelya Kale. Is that what you mean?
1011 2018-09-18 21:37:44 I used to use Bepanthen with loads of success, but since they changed the 'recipe' apparently I shouldn't us it anymore, so I tried coconut oil. My first coconut oil recovery got infected and I had to take antibiotics. The others have been ok, but I had to change my application.
1012 2018-09-18 21:37:30 NIGERIAN POLITICS. 1 Samuel 16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

1014 2018-09-18 21:36:46 Where are men to get your oil changed, this is stuff I don’t like to do 
1015 2018-09-18 21:36:42 CBD oil will
1016 2018-09-18 21:36:35 I'll be alright if I run out of olive oil any time, I'll just wring it out
1017 2018-09-18 21:36:23 At the gas station, a biker just furiously wheeled by and yelled at everyone “GO GREEN! NO OIL! SAVE THE EARTH!” 
Everyone was like 
1018 2018-09-18 21:36:08 Worry not Comrade Kyle, Benevolent Putin will not allow our puppet to make any overt aggressive pushes like he is currently doing in the Black Sea or in Syria or through allies like blowing up the oil deal with Germany. We have him getting pissed on by sluts, no worries
1019 2018-09-18 21:35:56 It will. Love me some perfume. And a good quality oil. I’m a Chanel girl at heart tho.
1020 2018-09-18 21:35:52 So I havent been taking my cbd oil bc I ran out and havent gotten more and I just did a presentation for bonus

I was all over the place bc I didn't practice and I got anxious but for some reason my professor gave me all 10 bonus points askrhjsjfh
1021 2018-09-18 21:35:44 More so than selling his soul to the oil conglomerates?
1022 2018-09-18 21:35:35 Lmao I’m getting my oil changed and the guy says “you drive a lot” bc I was here a month ago  ya, I drove 3,000 miles in a month. A girls got place to BEEEEE

1028 2018-09-18 21:35:11 Good day @tundeonakoya, I also noticed that the Honda 2008 that I use is showing 15% oil life after servicing with Mobil oil. Please enlighten me. Thanks. I didn't change the oil to another brand, thus I'm curious.
1029 2018-09-18 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this September? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
1030 2018-09-18 21:35:03 ive never had such a great experience getting an oil change and some additional services...amazing customer service! @Valvoline on 117th and Sunset. EXCEPTIONAL.
1031 2018-09-18 21:35:03 Hahaha don’t be fuming that your club only got good cause of oil money lad
1032 2018-09-18 21:34:57 I think ND oil is much easier to refine than the thick crude from Venezuela.
1033 2018-09-18 21:34:50 Ready to try this oil tonight for my hair 
1034 2018-09-18 21:34:43 Smell of used oil<<
1035 2018-09-18 21:34:40 You’re supposed to sear it in the hot oil and when it’s brown on both sides. Turn off heat, add butter (and herbs if you have them) and baste rapidly with a large spoonful over until the butter has melted and browned. Remove from pan to rest.
1036 2018-09-18 21:34:39 Great win we made another good side look ordinary, we just love rolling these Oil Money Clubs over #LFC #UCL
1037 2018-09-18 21:34:13 Checking it out to see how many oil leases you can divide it  into?
1038 2018-09-18 21:34:00 Fresh oil change, what city am I hitting up next 
1039 2018-09-18 21:33:53 Sorry I was in a hurry when I wrote this. In my POV I think: - price of oil will go up - value will go up or be the same (it won't go down) - oil will deplete so they need to invest in non-oil sector
1040 2018-09-18 21:33:42 Moonrocks.......think you but no thank you. Moonrocks is nothing but shitty weed that tries to get covered up by rolling it in wax, oil and then rolling it in keif. Fuck you and your bullshit.
1041 2018-09-18 21:33:26 For sure the reliance on ME oil is much reduced, but it still accounts for one fifth of global supply. Not peanuts. Also cost of production subsea is above 50$ compared to single digits in ME fields. ME oil importance is reduced but still v v significant
1042 2018-09-18 21:33:25 Good day @tundeonakoya, please I have Honda 2008 and I noticed that if I service the car, 1-2 weeks, the oil will be dark but the viscosity will still be ok.what is wrong please.
1043 2018-09-18 21:33:19 Hi Len you seem well read on this subject so I have been smoking strong weed for year's to deal with stress and anger it definitely works for me and I still have all my facilities I'm about to try the CBD oil but worried it won't have the same affect coz the absent THC ??
1044 2018-09-18 21:32:55 and our coal oil and natural gas production puts us in the driver's seat no?
1045 2018-09-18 21:32:51 primarily composed of olive oil balsamic vinegar and salt
1046 2018-09-18 21:32:46 I don't know anything about CBD oil. In the focus side of things have you tried pomodoro method or the 52/17 method?
1047 2018-09-18 21:32:40 The Environmental Protection Administration says C-P-C is responsible for an oil leak at a gas station on Green Island that polluted nearby groundwater supplies.
1048 2018-09-18 21:32:33 If hypocrisy was clean energy, we could shut down the oil industry right now, and run clean for millennia on the @GOP during @SenateMajLdr’s “leadership.”

1051 2018-09-18 21:31:52 Jeez it’s getting really stormy outside now. And I’ve just had an encounter with a huge spider which was casually strolling across our sitting room floor. Time to stock up on peppermint oil again 
1052 2018-09-18 21:31:50 The Great Lake of Jandelle exists in one of Demacia's few flat expanses not dominated by woodland or farmland.

Under the light of the rising moon it looks black as oil with silver-lined ripples.

1055 2018-09-18 21:31:10 I’m grateful God made peppermint and someone extracted it’s oils that I may have relief from itchy scalp  For those (like me) who love braids but can’t get used to the itch, pure peppermint oil in a spray bottle is a healer. You’ll smell like a mint but it’s so worth it 
1056 2018-09-18 21:30:58 Finally got an oil change 
1057 2018-09-18 21:30:38 went for an oil change & I need other shit. I mean I can almost get it, I just don’t wanna spend the money
1058 2018-09-18 21:30:33 Yes I have looked on a map. I take the position that thanks to fracking and other technology the Middle East and it’s oil (of which Syria admittedly  has little) is no longer of prime importance to us. We need to stop intervening in their affairs.

1063 2018-09-18 21:30:22 So who cares. Drilling companies don’t drill holes to find oil. They drill holes to drill a hole. They still get paid if nothing comes out. dApp devs got paid up front to create a dApp. Who cares if anyone uses it. Premines only need some value to to ruin the incentive.

1073 2018-09-18 21:29:33 Neither does Alberta. No one advocating here for shutting down oil production. Just being responsible and diversifying.
1074 2018-09-18 21:29:32 I feel like car places take advantage of me because I’m a small girl child and they’ll tell me that my oil change is $170 and I’ll just say okay and pay it cuz I’m dumb
1075 2018-09-18 21:29:21 Can't beat a day of Oil Boom Olympics!
1076 2018-09-18 21:29:16 Because we should all have a role in protecting vulnerable people inc those with gender dysphoria who are bring sold the "trans" snake oil.
Also this has as much to do with straight people as it has to do with gay people. It's not a orientation related, but a difference thing.
1077 2018-09-18 21:29:06 My car is 20,000 miles overdue for an oil change but I will be spending this twenty dollar bill on weed
1078 2018-09-18 21:29:03 i just cussed the man out while he was changing my oil bc he was being an ass & he walked off so another man has to do it & it’s free... how’s ur day :)

1087 2018-09-18 21:27:51 That’s all fairly recent. Venezuela’s problems started a long time ago when myopic leaders decided not to develop other sectors like agriculture falling behind developed nations, nationalized oil industry, & hand out subsidies like there was no end in sight.
1088 2018-09-18 21:27:48 Are y’all giving yourself a mineral oil rinse after the water runs clear? It does dry you out but Azealia is tripping is she thinks we bout to be out here shitting on dicks.

1107 2018-09-18 21:24:08 I love it drizzled with olive oil and cracked pepper
1108 2018-09-18 21:23:49 a classmate told me how in Norway which we consider being Nordic and all to be very Green, they encourage mixed oil for transport ie coal/ fossil fuel + biofuel which is basically palm oil (by discouraging it in food intake) such that now consumption of PO has tripled not reduced

1110 2018-09-18 21:23:45 No thanks @GovofCO You’ve been oddly silent the past two years and you’ve left the state of CO beholden to Oil and Gas Industry.
1111 2018-09-18 21:23:45 For blancmanges, very lightly grease the inside of the mould with light olive oil. Put a small bit on a piece of kitchen towel. For jellies, wet the mould before adding liquid. Dip base of mould in hot water for 5 to 10 seconds. Getting out of the mould is hardest bit. Good luck!

1126 2018-09-18 21:22:25 So many black cis ppl scamming other black ppl when they could be helping out vulnerable black ppl like black trans ppl but the plantation snake oil moods abounds
1127 2018-09-18 21:22:09 The North knows exactly what they are doing. They only refer to the people from the Niger-Delta as Igbo when it is convenient to them but when ever the issue of oil and Biafra is raised, they will refer to them as Niger-Deltans. The undiluted truth is that we are all Biafrans.
1128 2018-09-18 21:22:09 I’m sitting in here getting my oil changed & I’m yawning every 5 minutes

1131 2018-09-18 21:21:57 Ooo baby powder oil! Didn't know that existed!
1132 2018-09-18 21:21:53 You know that as fact do you, got a direct line to Spain lol? Things change rapidly in politics and if Scotland gets independence there is plenty of support in eu. It's not oil n gas, but that's useful too, but renewables the EU interested in & already big investors in Scotland.
1133 2018-09-18 21:21:27 Yeah, their opinions range from 'white supremacist bitching about immigrants' to 'paid shill for oil companies denying climate science'.

These ideas aren't audacious, they're toxic.
1134 2018-09-18 21:21:20 Simple mathematics oil money is the basis of their ratings. Stop misleading people.

1136 2018-09-18 21:21:01 Don’t bother.  They are easily influenced by far right conspiracy theories and believe a lying autocrat who has sold snake oil his whole life.
1137 2018-09-18 21:20:57 I don’t kno who daughter need to hear this but , get a oil change 
1138 2018-09-18 21:20:51 its not socialism fault in Venezuela I'm not an advocate for it but the truth is the truth once Chavez nationalized oil and kicked out Exxon and Shell the U.S made it harder and harder for Venezuela to obtain USD

1141 2018-09-18 21:20:37 Remember oil is a sealer, it will seal dryness if your skin is dry

1145 2018-09-18 21:20:24 Me: brings my textbook with me while my car’s oil gets changed
Also me: immediately opens twitter and ignores my textbook
1146 2018-09-18 21:20:22 I spent most of my teens living with an Indian family so I cook from that tradition a lot, I comfortably eat with my hands. I learned to oil my hair and skin from a jamaican friend. I work with people from many cultures so I learned to look for cues, to be considerate.
1147 2018-09-18 21:20:18 That's beautiful! I feel as if I'm standing in a dark cave and looking at it with an oil lamp like in 'The English Patient'. 
1148 2018-09-18 21:20:08 Expenditure and population are rising faster than income. Value of currency has fallen in an import dependent economy. Oil prices have fallen. The budget is unaffordable. That’s why are borrowing. The savings from TSA are not sitting in a bank. It is making a bad situation better

1158 2018-09-18 21:18:15 Deadass got chills when I walked into guzzlord home even tho I’ve been here before.. I can also here a bit of the Hau’oil theme. Yeah I know it’s more hearable backwards but it still sounds like it at points if you just stop and listen.

1161 2018-09-18 21:17:29 Does anyone on my TL do oil pulling? I have questions
1162 2018-09-18 21:17:25 It just happens to be liberal censorship of conservatives.  My points: 1) Censorship is bad.  2) These platforms are too large to permit such censorship.

Its 120 years ago one could have said "Well, you don't have to buy Standard Oil".  But it would be silly to believe it. /2
1163 2018-09-18 21:17:16 Just changed my own oil...can’t tell me nothing rn

1169 2018-09-18 21:16:39 She like buys neem in powder from amazon and makes the oil herself, she said to make sure it’s 100% organic and there’s like tutorial videos on YouTube that show you how to make it
1170 2018-09-18 21:16:31 Carlos Gomez??... You guys are shooting oil on that morning show with some of your crazy trade ideas. Michael Conforto for JT Realmuto??.. Are you guys on drugs?... a star left handed power hitting outfielder for a catcher that’s already shot his load. No way.
1171 2018-09-18 21:16:19 Someone oil up those things

1178 2018-09-18 21:15:14 Oh Glenda needs an oil change
1179 2018-09-18 21:15:08 Unionists are running scared, Tory knows with SNP in Holyrood,  they don't have full control of the uk. Also, the fact that Westminster knows without oil the strength of the £ will drop, and credit rating fall.
1180 2018-09-18 21:14:58 Sekarang ni kebanyakan brand semua dah go natural. Maybe ramai yang dah sedar kot akan kebaikan natural oil ni kot. Tisu dah ada bau lemongrass. Syampu dah ada campur geranium, cardamom. Tapi yang pasti semua natural dah

1188 2018-09-18 21:14:02 Idk who needs to see this but it’s time to get an oil change
1189 2018-09-18 21:13:52 No doubt it will be steeped in your anti oil hypocrisy Ms. Berman. Albertans are tired of hypocrites like you and Suzuki shit talking the most regulated energy industry in the world. You would be pretty obtuse to not expect to anger directed towards a hypocrite.
1190 2018-09-18 21:13:51 I got nag champa and lemongrass oil for my diffuser from five below. They had a salt lamp but I wanted to save my money. I didn’t spend much but still. This five below is on point 
1191 2018-09-18 21:13:51 Okay, so I have naturally curly hair. Here’s my process: shower (only use conditioner), use a crazy amount of leave in conditioner and oil, dry it in a cotton wrap-thing, hope for the best. It’s usually not far from what he’s got going on.

1193 2018-09-18 21:13:35 This kid in my middle school used to get made fun of because he’d always care around those oil absorbing sheets for his face but honestly he was living in 3008 while the rest of those sweaty kids were so 2000 late.
1194 2018-09-18 21:13:13 also soaking your snake in warm water for maybe 10-20 minutes and dabbing mineral oil on their eyes with a cotton swab after you take them out of the water will help with stuck shed on their eyes it may take a day though but its kind of safer imo my bud,but do what works for u b

1196 2018-09-18 21:12:05 Lets be honest - it doesnt end well for the Middle East boys when they face #LFC in the #UCL - you can spend your oil money all you want but it'll never win you European Royalty like us...
Traditions still rule the roost in Europe - just ask RM,Barca,AC Milan,Bayern etc.Period!!!
1197 2018-09-18 21:12:00 Really sorry to hear about your diagnosis, however, I think you should try and use cannabis oil to help with your condition I heard it helps massively
1198 2018-09-18 21:11:37 Agreed.
Not everyone is up on what a “seed oil” is, though...
1199 2018-09-18 21:11:15 What about also focusing on providing energy services to these countries? If there are bottlenecks with getting an oil product to market, why can't the high quality skills present in the energy sector be a focus of export. There's a need to expand outside the WCSB.
1200 2018-09-18 21:11:08 Yup that reason is NDP
And transmountain ruling as well as an eastern leader who hates the west... add a little market pricing and oil value and....... voila
1201 2018-09-18 21:10:44 Girl I need all dat, and amber oil!
1202 2018-09-18 21:10:37 Look into neem oil, I have this one customer that comes in and swears by it to grow her hair, she’s been doing for about a month or two and her hair has already grown a whole ass inch- inch and a half
1203 2018-09-18 21:10:27 All Turkish Nation behind you against Israel! They are killers! If Erdogan acts with Israel the next day he will lose his chair believe me! The reason US interests in middleeast 1st oil, 2nd Israel. Russia Iran and Turkey needs to show who is the boss in the region
1204 2018-09-18 21:10:26 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

1211 2018-09-18 21:10:07 Consumption will increase as the spending capacity of citizens increase. This is not something one can control. If govt. is really serious about oil consumption it should immediately start subsidizing electric or eco friendly cars.
1212 2018-09-18 21:10:07 Random thought. I’ve been taking @NaturesUltra for 7 months now and my energy levels are great. I do drink a cup or two of  each morning but i feel the CBD oil keeps me going. No extra caffeine needed mid day. #energy #natural #Tuesdaythoughts #cbdlife #letsgo #takenote

1218 2018-09-18 21:09:21 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1219 2018-09-18 21:09:16 Agreed, I always believe in food sources (whenever possible) instead of popping pills.

• Beef Liver instead of Vit B12/Multi's
• Sushi or even Liquid Fish Oil instead of capsules
• Kimchi/Kombucha instead of probiotic supps
• Blueberries instead of snake oil nootropics etc.

1225 2018-09-18 21:08:42 It‘s always great when a traditional club wins against a with oil Billions artificially created commercial club. And if that's Kloppo, who wins against Tuchel, it was a particularly good football evening.  #Liverpool 
1226 2018-09-18 21:08:29 It’s the conundrum I had. 18s have had an issue with 3rd gear shift forks and they also don’t have the trans/oil/rear coolers the 17+ Shelby’s got. So it was “lightly used Shelby” that won’t depreciate like leftover pizza or an 18 GT you have to explain to people

1234 2018-09-18 21:06:56 So what are you doing to combat all the harm you are causing by reforming your EPA rules that help keep us safe?  Oh right, they don’t count since you are helping your corrupt friends in the oil and gas industries.

1240 2018-09-18 21:05:45 Do you use CBD oil for anxiety? I just bought some to replace benzos like clonazepam/ativan and I'm curious about your experience.
1241 2018-09-18 21:05:45 You were responsible for the oil crisis at age 8? Am impressed
1242 2018-09-18 21:05:44 You are such a pessimist 
Oil is non renewable...
They use theirs up...
Viola...

Besides the future is in renewables
1243 2018-09-18 21:05:41 They represent a vast interest group that Tesla and EV eco system is going to forever disrupt... ICEs, oil, dealers, gas stations, oil changes, smog.... just to name a few ....
1244 2018-09-18 21:05:36 Would rather support Liverpool, class football and no oil money best of both worlds 
1245 2018-09-18 21:05:35 It's not possible... we don't produce oil. Even in Saudi Arabia these days taxes are more than Pakistan. Forget about Europe they literally strip people naked with taxes.

1247 2018-09-18 21:05:29 @SenSchumer is a snake oil salesmen
1248 2018-09-18 21:05:29 Still very grateful for @lizzo‘s conversation with @jvn on #GettingCurious. Thank you for the gift that is “Coconut Oil”.
1249 2018-09-18 21:05:29 Take a look at other mid engine cars.  They all have grills on the front.  A lot of times they put radiators and oil coolers up front.  You can only get so much air into the engine compartment of a mid-engine car.  That’s one of the downsides.
1250 2018-09-18 21:05:29 Bases on the very rich guys I knew in my 20s (except one, who was a working man before hitting oil), this is normal crackpot behavior.
1251 2018-09-18 21:05:12 Good excuse....! Last time they said the same thing when oil went up...... but prices never came down when price of oil went down.....so quasi CEO you are full of s...t, you are just lucky that there are lots of stupid people believe in your story.....
1252 2018-09-18 21:05:07 Use coconut oil on your lips before bed for all day softness
1253 2018-09-18 21:04:55 No, he'll demand Cody book an show there called Oil In featuring a four-way women's elimination match. In this context "elimination" means they all get stoned to death. But who am I to judge other cultures?

1256 2018-09-18 21:04:36 #Iranian oil minister will not attend OPEC meeting in Algeria. (Reuters).
A big mistake on Iran's part. #Iran should not put itself in isolation and leave the stage to its rivals. Iran must use every opportunity in international gatherings to present its arguments and cases.
1257 2018-09-18 21:04:33 Great question
1258 2018-09-18 21:04:17 Damn shame they didn't earn a living wage during careers. Tough to get by on a few measly million a year.
1259 2018-09-18 21:04:06 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

1262 2018-09-18 21:03:41 Tripled output means Canadian oilsands are dead- Mexico intends to not only build a pipeline but also refineries in three years (which they will do). Canada will have no need for a pipeline and USA no need for Canadian oil when Mexican oil will be available on both Gulf and ocean

1264 2018-09-18 21:03:28 Have you tried cbd oil? It helps calm them, my sister uses it for her puppers. Mine both have it but they are cage trained so as long as they are together in a familiar place they are fine

1272 2018-09-18 21:02:59 If thats the kind of attitude the players have bought by oil money you can fucking ram it. I'd have jurgens men playing with100% honesty any day. Get in Liverpool!
1273 2018-09-18 21:02:52 I see more down- than up-side for oil $. IR shortage artificial & will +/- resolve. VZ-LB-NG are chronic & counterbalance. Producers will find other ways out of Permian +/-. All forecasts see surplus in IH 2019 & weaker demand + EM gloom. Simplistic perhaps but my view for now.
1274 2018-09-18 21:02:43 Stormy Daniels has had more mechanics giving her oil changes its a miracle she feels anything smaller than a 12 inch gear stick she wouldn't know if 99% of men had even dipped the oil stick in

1280 2018-09-18 21:02:20 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
1281 2018-09-18 21:02:20 Waste of oil money!
1282 2018-09-18 21:02:19 i’m thinking i want to invest in oil paints to try bc of this!! i don’t like that it will take so long to dry but i also like that it doesn’t dry instantly so you can keep blending and adding more too it without it getting too muddy
1283 2018-09-18 21:02:12 Boy i need a oil change bad

1285 2018-09-18 21:01:53 p 478 does not say anything about mileage but in < 1 year the "A" service is showing up... which is change oil. I get that it says to change it every 12 months, but why would it show up after only around 1000 non-EV miles?
1286 2018-09-18 21:01:40 Oh wow, Argan oil should heal & seal ends. That's interesting. Hopefully the Shea line works. I def recommend coconut oil - great for luster, growth stimulation, scalp moisturizing & it helps prevent split ends (not heal).

1293 2018-09-18 21:00:53 The FACT the IMF has the view no sane government would allow Brexit to damage its society is not a forecast. It’s a prediction based on value, which is why WM mortgaged its loans against North Sea oil.  We can consider ourselves warned is the message
1294 2018-09-18 21:00:47 I had my first car at 17. An ‘81 Monte Carlo. I blew up the motor cuz it needed oil but I put it in the transmission.

1303 2018-09-18 20:59:48 The GDP of Russia is about the same as New York City. Why is Russia so powerful? There are only two men who by themselves can disrupt the world economy. King of KSA and dictator of Russia. Because oil and gas.

1322 2018-09-18 20:57:39 In the 21st century, with most countries having banned whaling, the sale and use of whale oil has practically ceased. And yet the production and retailing of baby oil continues unabated.

1331 2018-09-18 20:56:22 Meanwhile oil corporations continue to build nasty ass pipelines all over the place! Report on that please buddy! The platform you have coiuld really benefit them. The native americsn community is under attack! Look it up. Thats a issue worth reporting on.
1332 2018-09-18 20:56:17 Absolutely dominated one of the best sides in the world (on paper). Reality is, #PSG are a team of oil funded mercenaries in a poor league. #LFC 3-2 flattered PSG. Robertson and Trent - elevating themselves to become among the best full-backs in Europe.
1333 2018-09-18 20:56:08 Fuck that oil money club.
They deserved NOTHING.
that cunt Mbappe can stick his celebration up his turtle looking ass.

1334 2018-09-18 20:55:58 Yeah man PSG will never win anything significant. Clubs cursed. No oil money can help. Liquidate and feed the poor around Paris to help the community
1335 2018-09-18 20:55:53 If they are crispy it’s usually due to technique of cooking them on the area you may be using the wrong temperature or pressing down too much. Also the lack@of oil/ghee will give a harder drier roti

1339 2018-09-18 20:55:27 It's legal in 28 states & the district of columbia either medicinally or recreationally or both. I highly recommend Rick Simpson oil. It is available in CBD only, 50/50 THC/CBD & THC, which is the original formula, I believe.
1340 2018-09-18 20:55:24 Mix turmeric and buttermilk in a paste apply under eye, let dry & wipe clean. If it stains you can use an essential oil to clean, perfect for acne too.  Repeat 2-3x a week
1341 2018-09-18 20:55:24 Could the unionists please explain how Scotland is impoverished within this union while our closest neighbours also with oil are not poor? 

Isn't this fact alone a damning critique of Scotlands fate in the UK? 

Anyone?

1347 2018-09-18 20:54:47 Shame about the original tank. Always looked a stunning bike in Roberts colours. Always heat seized mine using cheap 2stroke oil! Use a quality brand would be my advice Martin.
1348 2018-09-18 20:54:40 yay... the @Sears sub contractor just wiggled the choke loose again, released the pressure from over compression & it 'should work again' after I change the oil, fill the tank & charge the battery. The over compression, empty tank, and dead battery are from the choke being open.
1349 2018-09-18 20:54:40 I've tried 2 in the past and they were really gentle and I liked them. (1) Farmacy Clean Bee - (has more honey) (2) Kora Organics Cleanser - aloe vera, green tee and sandalwood oil

1383 2018-09-18 20:51:48 The whole issue is far beyond BEV or FCEV. It's a systemic issue. To be honest, although I don't like Big Oil either, they are welcome to invest in the energy revolution.

1395 2018-09-18 20:50:37 the "comparable economies" are either Germany--a parasitic rentier--and the oil rich countries. Non-surplus EU economies did much worse than the UK, whose independent currency allowed it leeway.

1533 2018-09-18 20:33:11 this will probably bring that snake oil salesman Elon Musk snooping around to get tax payer funding to sell this idea

1541 2018-09-18 20:32:31 Yes, they must be excited by you cutting National Monuments, opening oceans to oil, and covering public lands with oil-gas-coal. Taking care of them?? You are destroying them.

1559 2018-09-18 20:29:57 It’s when RSA and Saudi are conflated? Who is SA @QBlueSkyQ - your research. SA (as Saudi) have oil; RSA have Gold; ; Uranium; Thorium (<- what’s that? oops there goes Gravity ). What is Cobalt? Who mines it? #ZambianCopper
1560 2018-09-18 20:29:40 Oh so the oil sands are immune to criticism? Not tyrannical at all.

1562 2018-09-18 20:29:10 I understand that Scotland was dragged into an illegal war, which the UK needs to take responsibly for, not that educated on the Wm and oil system

However, Scotland debt is twice as higher than the amount of UK's debt
Surely Scotland needs to take responsibility for that?

1579 2018-09-18 20:27:06 Canada's oil subsidies are at 34B (those include sunk costs of climate change). The pipeline did cost 4B. The loss of us letting fatcat americans steal our oil at 5% (as opposed to 78% for norway) is costing us billions.

The answer is simple: Nationalize the oil industry.
1580 2018-09-18 20:27:01 Great to see so many articles reporting on your awesome achievement..
1581 2018-09-18 20:26:49 What a scam.  If it has to be propped up by governmrnt (co2 taxes) that is all we need to know. Free market decides what people want you invest in. More snake oil from the globalists.

1583 2018-09-18 20:26:40 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
1584 2018-09-18 20:26:30 Crude oil has the same set up.  The options get below 20 cents and they have massive upside reward and low risk.
1585 2018-09-18 20:26:19 Seems you have a short memory, Dr Oz. Remember just a few years back when some were accusing you of being a snake oil salesman on TV?  You had to vigorously defend yourself against these people who didn’t know your heart, but were judging you. Kind of like Roseanne.

1593 2018-09-18 20:24:55 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stress can cause hair loss. Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Is it NISIM or NHB? Prevents hair loss. or similar? How will I determine the right address. No problems. No DEA.
1594 2018-09-18 20:24:52 Sustainable finance to you Kathy is simply taxpayer money enhanced by a carbon tax to fuel your narcissist policies disguised as climate change. Phony Kathy trying to deceive Canadians. No better than a snake oil seller.
1595 2018-09-18 20:24:44 also olive oil and bread taste even better in the winter
1596 2018-09-18 20:24:43 Ah it's so good. The oil is great, but those beans add so much indelible savoury goodness
1597 2018-09-18 20:24:38 Tare up nafta , set Canada's RESOURCES FREE , 53$ oil per Barrel 8$ discount , billions of liters of water , natural gas , all for cheap,  all American businesses here reaping the benefits, canadain company's can't compete. Canada will do fine
1598 2018-09-18 20:24:37 Fair enough. My point, to summarize and finish, is that Ven gets far more revenue selling oil to citgo (which is not subject to sanctions) than citgo profits from refining and distributing (which sanctions prevent them from repatriating to Ven).
1599 2018-09-18 20:24:14 They don't have the materials nor the technology to stockpile nuclear weapons. I agreed with Trump pulling out of Obama's failed treaty with Iran and condemning his cash giveaway to that state. The oil embargo is nothing more then a business decision not national security. More
1600 2018-09-18 20:24:13 Originally started with big tobacco money and is now led by Joanie Bronfman, one of the heirs to the Seagram fortune. Somewhat ironic that profits from the two biggest human vices have been front and centre in Tides and are now trying to stymie another big vice (oil) .

1609 2018-09-18 20:22:57 The general idea of "the mob," should be reexamined. A digital mob of a relative few, worldwide, can be assembled without leaving domicile. Digital mobs or legal mobs of relative few without majority support have immense power over society, unexpected ways

1620 2018-09-18 20:21:49 Meanwhile, Trump’s sanctions on Iran have had the desired effect - to drive up the price of oil to please Puppet Master Putin.. consumers get sacked too !
1621 2018-09-18 20:21:37 That's why U.S.; Canada; and Mexico should increase oil and natural gas supplies.

1636 2018-09-18 20:19:28 Politicians and 36 Bloggers are misleading the gullible mass/Public. Uhuru Kenyatta did not reduce Oil VAT from 16% to 8%. He INCREASED it from 0% to 8%. But I gotta blame Raila and ODM for Uhuru's actions.

1657 2018-09-18 20:17:18 I have my own issues with the Saudis in particular, like the way we prop them up in return for crude. What you say is true. But I do remember the orange one and/or minions blaming Mr. Obama for high gas prices. I blame T for a benighted energy policy that leans to oil, oil, oil.

But this helps & I'm so happy about it. If you're in doubt whether to give it a try: DO IT! #LymeDisease #CBDoil
1667 2018-09-18 20:16:28 To be honest I'm amazed they haven't banned DHC when shorts are on for pointing out the positives as he does so well.

1669 2018-09-18 20:16:22 I used to really value centrism but now I realize it’s because I didn’t like confrontation. If you can’t pick out wrongs then wrong people will sell you snake oil.
1670 2018-09-18 20:16:17 We will be fair, just, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

1672 2018-09-18 20:15:41 If you are against buying oil from Saudi/Venezuela/USA, then stop using it--you see how that's an unreasonable request?  Also, if you are against buying oil from some countries that abuse human rights, why do you want to sell to some countries that have the same abuses?

1678 2018-09-18 20:14:39 This is a pretty easy problem to solve. If history profs were routinely paid 500 grand a year, you'd see plenty of conservative history profs. More important to me is the question of affirmative action for liberals in the oil industry.

1680 2018-09-18 20:14:07 I try to deep condition once a week, I use ogx shampoo and conditioner, and as I am leave in conditioner. Also going on 9 months no heat  that definitely helped a lot & lots of vitamins. Also tea tree oil for your scalp

1682 2018-09-18 20:13:54 China (SAFE) has traditionally been a large buyer of UST Bills at the auctions...they don't have to sell USTs to hurt the US...they can just stop buying in the weekly Bill auctions and go buy other assets (crude oil, gold, real estate, small countries).
1683 2018-09-18 20:13:42 Okay you guys put a gallon a oil and a bunch of butter congrats
1684 2018-09-18 20:13:41 Having wasted almost a decade as governor of an oil producing state you suddenly realized such bill could create a change in Delta. Why didn’t you influence the previous senators to sponsor such bill while you were in office as governor? Am sure Deltans aren’t that gullible
1685 2018-09-18 20:13:41 Me: what are you making?

Filipino logic amazes me.

1690 2018-09-18 20:12:39 I tried to ask for some olive oil once at a restaurant in Gaeta, to dip my bread in, and they brought me a bowl of olives. I shut up and ate my delicious olives.
1691 2018-09-18 20:12:31 "here is some oil to make pain less as a warm shower of "borgism" envelopes u like a blanket of sunshine. All shall ACCEPT"

1694 2018-09-18 20:12:25 J ai encore fait ce constat aujourd hui, échangeant avec une personne elle ne savait simplement que EM vendait des Muggs.

C'est pas gagné!

1696 2018-09-18 20:11:59 The ones that flew the planes are dead, based on your reaction their action to leave was prudent, OPEC is dead and most of the Saudi oil sheiks have been whipped into shape by MbS. Not very curious, more like an ideologue steeped in demagoguery, the world has changed.
1697 2018-09-18 20:11:58 This is how Doc gives people rope to hang themselves. 
I think he believes implicitly in the tenets of democracy. I think he believes in the sanctity of institutions and doesn't regard the political input that has traditionally served as the oil of those institutions.
1698 2018-09-18 20:11:44 Just heat some oil in the fry pan before you start.
1699 2018-09-18 20:11:43 When Fergie sang the National Anthem she sounded like the lady in Bob’s Burgers that sang the oil spill song.
1700 2018-09-18 20:11:36 So let me get this straight. She punishes Canadians for using oil and gas through a carbon tax, hoping to discourage them to use less or none at all. 

 but at the same time, she gets to fly around the world using the same energy source. 

And you think this is not hypocrisy?
1701 2018-09-18 20:11:35 Olbas oil. That was the bastard stuff.

1705 2018-09-18 20:11:02 If Trump agrees to pay Canada's oil the full Market price, even though this is not part of the Nafta deal, we should agree for the dairy issue. He doesn't even mention the dairy tariffs in U.S...Besides, he just made a deal with Poland for exporting LNG, establish U.S. military
1706 2018-09-18 20:11:01 We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor
1707 2018-09-18 20:10:58 2 hours at @FirestoneTires for an oil change...what a joke
1708 2018-09-18 20:10:42 You are 100% right, both on the technicals and the fact that’s it’s been claimed dead as many times as BTC , we are in a speculative market that’s not even close to the speculation seen in forex/gold/oil, so tons of room to grow. I just don’t invest where I don’t see utility

1709 2018-09-18 20:10:38 Correct. Like, 10 drops in a small rollerball, and the rest filled with grapeseed oil or sweet almond oil if that works with your scent.

1715 2018-09-18 20:10:06 Yes, unfortunately the education students get about the philosophies underpinning the founding principles, the Founders and the Constitution is simply that dead, cis, het, white, male, pro-capitalist, racist and misogynist rich people founded a deeply oppressive society.

1730 2018-09-18 20:08:18 Equatorial Guinea is rich in oil, but the wealth of the country, as is the case in many other African countries, has not translated into better living conditions or social amenities for the general populace. Surely the people of Africa deserve better leaders.

Richer nations of the Middle-East are being used to do some of the killing. Even so, FAR more refugees are hosted in the ME than in Europe.
1736 2018-09-18 20:07:24 Born in middle of last century and can compare Soviet alliance times vs EU. There is no resemblance Mr @mstepinski . PL sold coal and food cheap to be able to buy soviet expensive oil. Politics &economics were fully submitted to USSR.

1767 2018-09-18 20:03:53 Say, when Conservatives wrote Chapter 6 of NAFTA you explicitly precluded national treatment of oil and gas - so you guys actually are the ones who made Canada dependent on the whims of international oil markets. #cdnpoli

1804 2018-09-18 19:59:31 BUT I HAVE THESE ESSENTIAL OILS THAT WILL CURE YOU JUST CHUG AN ENTIRE VIAL OF PEPPERMINT OIL #guthealth #bossbabe
1805 2018-09-18 19:59:30 @Ramathorn21 advances to the second round of the @3WideRCN playoffs. After managing a faulty oil cooler from contact in an early wreck for most of the race, Matt brings the car home in 6th place!! Hell of a drive bud!!#TeamHackathorn
1806 2018-09-18 19:59:22 T.Y. Danjuma dynasty. The legendary dynasty has been involved in installation & has been working with the power in central since the days of the 1st Military head of state,till date. The family has been in control of the petroleum sector, with ownership of the Highest oil well.
1807 2018-09-18 19:59:19  One of these days you might replyfirst of all, its NOT possible for most people to make their own oil. The danger of using solvent alone is bad enough, so if YOU don't sell UR own oil, at least tell us who makes the BEST version of UR oil online, Thanks  #RSOoil
1808 2018-09-18 19:59:05 Yall remember Paris Hilton can can?? Is smells like literal sugar oil and someone is wearing it in my lecture hall.
1809 2018-09-18 19:58:44 What about his involvement in a rape of a teenage Vietnamese girl while he was deployed in 68’..???? ............oh wait
1810 2018-09-18 19:58:39 Coconut oil, avocado oil, almond oil.
1811 2018-09-18 19:58:35 You'll learn. Put some lemon juice and honey in it, then steam your head with hot water and try some eucalyptus oil in it. Don't put your head in the water...
1812 2018-09-18 19:58:28 svikt monitorering er bare en liten del av e-helse. Teknologien gjør det mulig å «tenke nytt» også vdr reinnleggelser. Snevert å avfeie e-helse som «snake oil medicine»? Hva synes @naeemzahid @ehealthNORWAY @Perlend @steinskr ?
1813 2018-09-18 19:58:23 I would literally pay piles of money to fly with an #airline that didn't spend the final 20 minutes of a flight BLASTING their membership/credit card/timeshare/snake oil schemes over the intercom.
1814 2018-09-18 19:58:13 Taylor + Oil... So there is such a thing as heaven on Earth I see. 
1815 2018-09-18 19:58:09 A classical education focusing heavily on constitutional principles, especially in formative years, one of our greatest failures.
It is the core of who we are, not some partisan elitist or politician telling us their interpretation of who we are. Good read
1816 2018-09-18 19:58:00 Getting an oil change for my car before I take a road trip 
1817 2018-09-18 19:57:57 Use coconut oil
1818 2018-09-18 19:57:48 The USA protects the very same Alquaeda who bomb the twin towers, against Russia and Syria that fight to destroy the vey same terrorists. I conclude that America is selling its soul to retain the oil and weapon transactions of the Saudis. Follow the money!
1819 2018-09-18 19:57:36 No they workimg behind the scenes to get this going.  I dont imagine it will have the euphoric effect, mire like CBD oil.
1820 2018-09-18 19:57:35 all the lube and oil must have dried up then
1821 2018-09-18 19:57:13 Laaaaaa an kona priyom

1823 2018-09-18 19:57:02 Each ticket bought comes with a bottle of snake oil
1824 2018-09-18 19:56:57 Diced bacon and red onion, spinach, bow tie pasta. Lots of olive oil and parmesan cheese
1825 2018-09-18 19:56:53 Toothpick Tuesday - pouring chilli oil over already marinated olives even though olives usually give you a tummy ache, especially this amount! But maybe this time it will be different ....
1826 2018-09-18 19:56:37 Oil will pay for it ! Er ...
1827 2018-09-18 19:56:36 Can you make a variety of no oil??!! Oil is empty calories. To quote a fellow no oil advocate “oil is the fat equivalent to eat straight sugar”
1828 2018-09-18 19:56:14 I read an article by an Indigenous elder, formerly in law enforcement, including on the Rez . She stated her concerns about vans of Native women driving to the “man camps” at the oil fields to earn some “extra money.”This is like placing your head in the mouth of a hungry lion...
1829 2018-09-18 19:56:13 my scalp be drinking up some oil like the shit not expensive
1830 2018-09-18 19:56:12 To say that construction, big oil and mining companies in Alaska don't care about the environment just isn't true. Maybe those who make such broad statements should look into what these companies are currently doing.   VOTING NO ON 1 is the right thing for AK @standforalaska.
1831 2018-09-18 19:56:10 Are you sure that two massive oil price shocks and upward wage pressure from a unionised workforce that still existed back then had nothing to do with it?
1832 2018-09-18 19:56:06 @JoeVargas WHAT?? Thanks for the follow joe! Your CBD oil has changed my life for the better. Doctors used to feed me so many pills for my anxiety and depression, but I find your website and bam no more pills. 
1833 2018-09-18 19:55:59 There's a minor kerfuffle in #Texas RE #WillieNelson supporting #BetoORourke instead of #TedCruz.

REALLY? Willie blows weed and his tour bus runs on vegetable oil...does he seem like a #GOP voter???
1834 2018-09-18 19:55:58 I don’t kno who daughter need to hear this but , get a oil change 
1835 2018-09-18 19:55:49 I just spilled lavender oil all over my fucking homework and idk if i should be relaxed or stressed out rn
1836 2018-09-18 19:55:48 Are you near the oil producing tar sands?
1837 2018-09-18 19:55:47 How about hydrogen for fuel cells instead of wasting it on refining oil. It’s clean, you and your gas are dirty.
1838 2018-09-18 19:55:42 Get in there like you changing oil!!
1839 2018-09-18 19:55:37 Oil ~ Good for your skin ~
1840 2018-09-18 19:55:35 Yeah,  they're more like a mix of oil and watercolor. They come out darker and richer than watercolors. I actually like them better.
1841 2018-09-18 19:55:32 All I wanted was an oil change and @Valvoline tried to sell me on everything but a new car, which I can’t afford anyway when the oil change alone was $69
1842 2018-09-18 19:55:25 There are still Questions as to how cheap this oil is going to be.
1843 2018-09-18 19:55:24 FX Analysis:Again AUD and CAD are the strongest esp. against USD but for CAD I suggest U as oil price will change suddenly these weeks be very careful , Subscribers kindly check UR emails plz I explain the levels of trading till tomorrow evening which fully  profitable & accurate
1844 2018-09-18 19:55:23 Yeah but they take the nicotine juice out of them and fill them with THC oil... That's okay right LOL
1845 2018-09-18 19:54:51 what's getting me through autumn is the dreamgirls soundtrack and trader joe's vitamin e oil
1846 2018-09-18 19:54:51 Even if you burned it with fire, it looks like it would still smell lovely.  Maybe reminiscent of patchouli oil
1847 2018-09-18 19:54:49 Sorry bo ! I should know better.....no real South Philly Cuz would put Mayo on a Primos ! Oil only Bo.....Daaaak.....Gaaaaaw......
1848 2018-09-18 19:54:25 I'm still lost at how none of the Memorial Cup winning and participating Edmonton Oil Kings have panned out. Reinhart, Lazar, Samuelsson, Broissoit, Moroz, all busts. The only one that may have potential is Tristan Jarry in PITT
1849 2018-09-18 19:54:12 Same idiot that doesn’t at all understand immigration laws and was thoroughly embarrassed by ICE official during a house hearing on the subject. “....I’m confused...” 
1850 2018-09-18 19:54:01 Acrylic or oil. Acrylic will dry faster
1851 2018-09-18 19:53:53 It was very sad
1852 2018-09-18 19:53:43 I've tasted powers. And thats an @orlakiely oil cloth. That's all I know about whiskey @thatsdramgood
1853 2018-09-18 19:53:42 “Just shut and do what I want.”

Eerie.  I thought no meant no.
1854 2018-09-18 19:53:24 Owners of Nigeria are the business moguls in oil & gas, commodities, banking & finance. They have cozy relationship with whichever Govt is in power
1855 2018-09-18 19:53:12 I hereby nominate the next offshore oil well drilled to be named Pleasant Valley.  #BP #novascotia
1856 2018-09-18 19:53:11 I often pour a couple kettles worth of boiling water (or vinegar, so good) first to clear out some oil. And then plunge. Sometimes you have to alternate with your bathroom sink.
1857 2018-09-18 19:53:10 Yo so I just started making my own and it's super easy and cheap. 1 Tbsp coconut oil, 2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp arrowroot flour. Add essential oils if you like and mix up. Adjust baking soda if it is too much for you. 
Shit works great.
1858 2018-09-18 19:53:06 If they haven't touched His hem;dont let them touch your head! True oil isn't store bought...
1859 2018-09-18 19:52:55 today I learned snake oil is a real thing but, once again, white people fucked it up
1860 2018-09-18 19:52:42 Chitts put your glasses on...Mr David is on there too !!! the ultimate Christmas Advent with choccies.
1861 2018-09-18 19:52:42 I’ve heard castor oil
1862 2018-09-18 19:52:38 But he hasn’t failed yet. Why is everyone so damn surprised that this is taking long. Getting oil to port over First Nations territories in Canada is no small feat. If history tells us anything...
1863 2018-09-18 19:52:03 Oh yeah ive heard alot of good things about canabis oil too. Gonna get me some. ;) thanx for info.

1868 2018-09-18 19:50:55 Grandma lost her chill bt to me the slaps were not enough
1869 2018-09-18 19:50:49 the truth is , so far as I know, Scotland does not have an oil fund despite a significant amount being extracted in Scottish waters. I suppose you could argue westminster doesn't have a money laundering wealth fund as a result of the City of London's pre-eminence in that industry
1870 2018-09-18 19:50:47 Awe... now NC will smell like fake tan oil and hookers.
1871 2018-09-18 19:50:47 Have you spent. Day at a construction site, In an oil field or a farm. Your hard work meter needs to be calibrated

1873 2018-09-18 19:50:36 $GGII Have my fingers crossed on the inbound company. Rumors been circulating for a while that the inbound company is currently revenue producing and is in the oil and gas exploration sector. Company has been reinstated with Delaware SOS.
1874 2018-09-18 19:50:14 Who ever replied to the tweet saying makeup remover and baby oil and then deleted it ...I saw it  just didn’t catch the name . 
But thanks 
I’ve tried makeup remover but it doesn’t get it off completely.

1877 2018-09-18 19:49:56 You never hear much about UFO sightings these days.  I have no doubt the aliens gave up studying the dumbassery of humans
1878 2018-09-18 19:49:43 All I’m here for is an oil change, and watch them come back to me saying I need thousands of dollars in repairs again

＼It's OIL!!!／
1881 2018-09-18 19:49:10 Idk if you've already gotten this advice, but rubbing in some vitamin E oil might help restore and strengthen them faster!
1882 2018-09-18 19:49:10 Sorry. As regards chlorella, it is served in the shape of green pills made out of algae, which are helpful to dispose of heavy metals within your organism. That is what I know about it and I had been taking them for a while too. Another tip I was given is CBC oil (cannabis' oil).
1883 2018-09-18 19:48:51 From an energy point of view, from a global warming viewpoint and as a former oil worker, that is plain dumb.
1884 2018-09-18 19:48:51 Texas? I always thought it was oil, cattle, footbal, and guns 

Can't take away BBQ or guns. Take the football if you want.

1886 2018-09-18 19:48:27 Just bought an Outback and like it but when I checked the oil it had a whole extra quart. Not good. Check the oil level
1887 2018-09-18 19:48:20 Anytime a toddler is in a corner sitting quietly, what are the fist thing you check for?

1. The Lotion
2. The Hair oil

4. The clothes Pin Pan
1888 2018-09-18 19:48:19 They want the Golan because it's a strategic position militarily. And because now they apparently found oil. Unless you subscribe to the Greater Israel meme, the Israelis don't want more land from Syria. The Israelis want to secure their position and annihilate their enemies.
1889 2018-09-18 19:48:04 Idk who's daughter needs to hear this but get a oil change! 
1890 2018-09-18 19:47:40 If India enrich with oil Wells, then Hindus becomes biggest terrorist in the world. Don't bull shit about American fake terrorism propaganda without knowing geopolitical games.
1891 2018-09-18 19:47:28 i got the appropriate amount of sleep for a school night, remembered to take an iron supplement, a probiotic, and use cbd oil...this is like maximum adulting for me. achievement unlocked
1892 2018-09-18 19:47:18 the dentist, ponstan or clove oil? I used to do all except the first but actually went this year :)
1893 2018-09-18 19:47:18 I didn't hear anyone call Brown the "enemy" but did hear calls for him to do more where he has the authority. Just because taking on the oil industry over urban drilling & abuse of the regulatory system is difficult doesn't mean it doesn't have to happen alongside other measures.
1894 2018-09-18 19:47:07 He’s going to be needing some West Virginia Mystery Oil next when he truck stalls out.
1895 2018-09-18 19:47:04 What happened to the oil in Turkana.
Last time I heard trailers were blocked from leaving the area. Where is the oil headed to?
Why sign a tender for expansion of the crude oil offloading berth instead of the construction of a refinery

1900 2018-09-18 19:46:41 Which 3 countries do most of the bombing in the middle east? Britain, France and the US. Which 3 countries own most of the worlds oil producing companies? This is a case of the old empires just not wanting to let power ebb to the east.
1901 2018-09-18 19:46:34 Liverpool vs PSG game should be a lesson for you, you better stop dreaming about City winning the CL ‘cause oil money can’t win you Champions League. @Dr_ameeeen
1902 2018-09-18 19:46:30 Oil in my pen, burn it down, low-key
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
1903 2018-09-18 19:46:18 I wanted a canidate that would tax the rich and thats exactly what I got. Monsanto can sell their GMO soy elsewhere. Walmart can shove their cheap slave-labor prices up their ass. Apple can kiss my ass. No more Saudi oil. Local organic farmers in my home town are busy as usual.
1904 2018-09-18 19:46:04 People forget that the Internet runs on coal and oil. Just now a little on solar.  Paper does need some energy. I don't know the number,but I bet a trillion new trees would go a long way to climate stability.
1905 2018-09-18 19:45:54 Meunier pointing to the PSG badge like it doesn't just represent Oil money & Slavery
1906 2018-09-18 19:45:54 In @jkenney's Alberta only those who destroy the environment or wage war are worthy of recognition. He is a small, petty man with only one refrain, "Oil, oil, oil." Which is what his bosses in the energy industry who pay his wages demand.

1916 2018-09-18 19:45:07 Our problems at the moment have n oil thing to do with sigurdsson. He and wolcott have been our best players, outside of the catastrophe ar west ham. Dont try to compare him to other 10s, just look at overall contribution. When he plays well, which he usually does, we score.
1917 2018-09-18 19:45:06 Ngelishwa andizukwazi ukupha. Why ungathengi ezi oil nton-nton nje nawe?
1918 2018-09-18 19:44:58 You folks don't care about the Venezuelans. You want access to the oil. You keep failing in your attempts to overthrow the people's choice. How about you leave Venezuela alone and stop funding the opposition.
1919 2018-09-18 19:44:50 I chose BEGUSARAI over UCL 
1920 2018-09-18 19:44:49 i’ve been taking fish oil pills for ab 2 weeks and my dick still small, this is why we need guns in schools.
1921 2018-09-18 19:44:48 I’ve noticed same and made comments to her directly via Twtr. She clearly has a agenda Whilst trying to mask her anti trump position. Good observation ...was wondering if anyone else noticed. It’s clearly obvious, she needs to be removed.
1922 2018-09-18 19:44:45 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.
1923 2018-09-18 19:44:43 Right next to the oil wells
1924 2018-09-18 19:44:35 @instagram gx ##oil@a@@
1925 2018-09-18 19:44:31 Show your work... for example, what does the price of oil need to be at to return $46b in tax revenue?
1926 2018-09-18 19:44:17 *Didn't change after 1983, to lift the malaise.

*Legislation was put in place and consumers demanded efficiency in the 70s due to rising oil price and fuel crisis.
1927 2018-09-18 19:44:11 Also,  Trump is totally being fatshamed at every turn. That's the origination of the tie meme (long ties to hide belly), and EVERY SINGLE ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION OF HIM BEING OBESE. But,  you know,  it's Trump so it's ok. The left is full of hypocrites. Not trumpologizing.
1928 2018-09-18 19:44:07 Time for an oil Barron mate!! I’m sick of it
1929 2018-09-18 19:43:46 I love the 10 min oil change places
1930 2018-09-18 19:43:43 It's DEFINITELY NOT AID it's simply a BRIBE to the governments of #China #India #Pakistan & other #African counties for trade deals such as cheap #Oil & #Gold etc

1936 2018-09-18 19:43:14 trying to buy the CL win with all their dirty oil money. all the big clubs have money these days but at least LIV has some real history and not just buying up the most expensive players the last 4-5 years
1937 2018-09-18 19:43:06 If Paris don’t make some noise in champions league this year it ain’t looking good. Qatar gon have to spend some more oil money.
1938 2018-09-18 19:43:01 Yaa! & apparently that stuff is good for natural hair. So if you can turn it into oil!.. 
1939 2018-09-18 19:42:56 Oil is zero time
1940 2018-09-18 19:42:55 I'm still am tbh to a certain point 

But I think the wwe are more focused on the Super Showdown PPV and that sweet2 oil money

1941 2018-09-18 19:42:27 Why stop with Bhutan, You should invite Saudi Arabia or UAE to invade they have even cheaper oil. Imagine they will turn your city into Dubai. Felling good aren’t you. But how will you  get rid of Chinese sitting in Pakistan  ?

1961 2018-09-18 19:40:31 Making a point. 

Most Canadians want to fight climate change, want to see money invested in doing so, and are happy to see groups fighting climate change be well-funded. 

The big oil companies are far better funded and most of their money is foreign.

1987 2018-09-18 19:38:53 Notice how the prices are nowhere to be seen.  You may find yourself having to pick between that chicken sandwich and getting your oil changed and tires rotated.
1988 2018-09-18 19:38:53 I hear charcoal and coconut oil works!
1989 2018-09-18 19:38:29 this bitch really said getting her oil changed is a “mans job” and she’d rather stay and cook dinner because it’s a “woman’s job” .... oh so you’re dumb DUMB ho

The U.S. gave around $10 billion in subsidies annually to oil, natural gas and coal producers between 1950 and 2010
1998 2018-09-18 19:37:54 So you think it’s fair that something that’s 50p to get to the forecourt should cost £1.32 ?  How can other countries make fuel affordable but we can’t and we have more oil than lots of these countries ,

2014 2018-09-18 19:36:05 The patriach runs the whole circuit, from oil and gas to commodities to telcoms all via proxies and shell companies; Yet he maintains a large followership in the military! Nobody gets near the corridors of power without his endorsement ( fully or partially).

2025 2018-09-18 19:34:47 I use argan oil shampoo and conditioner. Makes for a healthy shine.
2026 2018-09-18 19:34:31 How about Brent crude prices? IDK if they’re shown along with WTI, but most Canadian media outlets don’t bother. Newfoundland oil sold at Brent rate or better.
2027 2018-09-18 19:34:29 serious question, are you supposed to tip the guy who does your oil change?!? i don’t wanna be rude
2028 2018-09-18 19:34:29 Nothing makes me wanna just drop out go and work on some oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico like the way accounting does

2035 2018-09-18 19:34:18 Whats your concern. I already pay 10-20% more to get items not made in China. Oil pricing seems more relevant to my daily expenses. My rent and organic local food wont be affected. Luxury items/electronics  and cheap crap is the only thing affected correct?
2036 2018-09-18 19:34:15 Yesterday I took my leftover truffle fries and refried them then I fried a couple eggs sunny side up in the leftover oil in the skillet and then heated up the queso that went with the fries and poured it over everything and HO BOY it was delicious
2037 2018-09-18 19:34:12 Went to Jiffy Lube today in warrensburg to get my oil changed and the guy spelt my name Anannan?!?
2038 2018-09-18 19:34:06 But don't worry. Trump says there is no global warming.His coal & oil billionaires won't let him
2039 2018-09-18 19:33:51 Replace the butter in almost every recipe with coconut oil. It has a rich, lightly sweet taste, and it’s super healthy.
2040 2018-09-18 19:33:48 Wright's Coal tar soap. I still use it, although it's not the original recipe. Car exhausts smelled, too. Gutters were rainbows with oil after the rain. Digging up the melted tar with lolly sticks in the summer (which lasted forever).
Sighs.

2045 2018-09-18 19:33:08 Still there are ways to better care for one's self like using certain facial cleaning/medical products, washing your face with soap & water, and even using steam from a hot shower to open up your pores and get the oil out. I learned all that the hard way.
2046 2018-09-18 19:33:03 Or if rates rise in the rest of the country? Theoretically Mr. Martin could be correct at $200/barrel oil.... maybe world conflict, Trump etc?

2050 2018-09-18 19:32:17 It needed a global capitalist financial crash, a more than halving of oil prices, & US funding of an opposition, to sink the VZ economic model, which wasn't very good to begin with. Why don't capitalists flock to Argentina, Brazil or Greece to taste that IMF Consensus medicine?

2085 2018-09-18 19:26:00 The devaluation of CAD wrt yuan was the fuel aka foreign buyers.  The interest rate reductions by BOC to fight the “2015 oil recession” was the flame aka Canadian speculators

2100 2018-09-18 19:22:37 Ross doesn't defend his arguments with facts he attacks his opponents with baseless claims. This is a guy who a few months ago talked about how Big Oil was paying shorts to take down Tesla but last month claimed that the Saudi Govt was going to buyout Tesla.

2109 2018-09-18 19:21:23 In an indirect way, they do: As Alberta cannot move out its oil production due to lack of pipelines, heavy Canadian bbls are heavily discounted, losing more than $10/bbl to its fair market price.

Sorry. Soak raisins in boiling water while you cook.
Toast pine nuts in pan til they brown, then remove.
Bit of oil in pan, brown a chopped onion, chuck in spinach on top til it reduces down.
Drain raisins and add them + pine nuts to spinach.
Dish up!

2173 2018-09-18 19:12:46 Yes exactly. The US and Canada should have super low gas prices, low heating oil and natgas prices. We'd have the farming, cattle and lumber industries locked up and of course the fishing industry too.  Need to vote out the libs and reduce the regulations.
2174 2018-09-18 19:12:46 Increasing vulnerability to intensifying weather events for one. Decaying physical infrastructure (roads, bridges) coupled with reliance on oil for another.

2179 2018-09-18 19:11:50 Dude, you're the one claiming fossil fuels never killed people, something easily proven to be false.

And I do get it, fossil fuels were a great benefit to our society. However, it's time to replace them with something better, just like how they replaced whale oil.

2202 2018-09-18 19:09:15 N.B. must have very mild winters if the annual carbon tax direct costs for NG @$50 per ton is only $96.  In 2017 in AB I paid $166.24 in direct costs for carbon tax on NG @$20 per ton.  Is it because they also heat with imported oil with no carbon tax?

2223 2018-09-18 19:06:17 I’m most definitely getting an oil treatment on my hair before i dye it again
2224 2018-09-18 19:06:11 I have never felt closer to you than I do right now. One time, I was getting my oil changed and a girl sat right next to me and started playing one. Literally the seat next to mine in an empty lobby.

It was at that moment that I became convinced the world is unjust.
2225 2018-09-18 19:06:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2226 2018-09-18 19:06:00 Best to move to Electricity. No engine damage or need for oil & other fossil related fluids. @Tesla led the way! @ClimateReality

2231 2018-09-18 19:05:39 Awesome that's badass XD I love it
2232 2018-09-18 19:05:36 Oohhh what kind of oil do you use for moisturizer? I've been using a mix of soybean and olive oil, and then Vitamin D gel under my eyes
2233 2018-09-18 19:05:30 People including me consume 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the morning for health benefits. Mediterranean diet (arguably the healthiest in the world) uses olive oil heavily. He called for reduced sugar in things like soft drinks, that has nothing to do with accessibility lol

2235 2018-09-18 19:05:10 The US snake oil salesman, sorry, physician, offered experimental untested trials for $1.2m which he agreed later under oath would not benefit him. Next.
2236 2018-09-18 19:05:03 Fuck all of their cheap ass slave labor garbage. I say stop trading with them. Put emphasis on being self sufficient as a nation. Also stop depending on foreign oil so much. We should all be driving electric cars, use our own oil for trucks, equipment and military use.
2237 2018-09-18 19:05:02 Regular olive oil is darker in color and not processed as much extra is used more for cooking

2239 2018-09-18 19:04:57 It would be nice if they would have more than anti oilsands speakers at their conference. I didn’t see Murray Edwards on the conference keynotes. And only after outrage they decided to bring a token pro oil sands voice

2241 2018-09-18 19:04:50 Its funny to read americans calling other presidents criminals and dictadors when the US is bombing countries and killing millions of innocents for oil, gas and other resources since the last 100 years. Lol.
2242 2018-09-18 19:04:46 Hi I'm Zephyr! 

      Me: I use expensive charcoal body wash and tea tree oil conditioner for my face and body

      My 86 years old uncle: Sounds like hipster nonsense

I guess I'm hipster now on top of being an emo trans intersex person
2243 2018-09-18 19:04:36 Yeah apparently it turns into rubbing oil lol
2244 2018-09-18 19:04:35 Your  like a old Cadillac lots of miles and a oil leak 
2245 2018-09-18 19:04:10 Lmao, mb I swear I saw one of those oil diffuser thingys in Rizals room. I kinda really want to try it tbh. Though it seems like a gateway trap
2246 2018-09-18 19:04:08 What's your idea of "full range" you orange goon?  "Divine intervention" paid for by your Big Oil? You are a disgusting cockroach; You are the gum under my shoe; You are a sociopath and a liar; corrupt and devoid of soul.

For all the people suddenly waking up to palm oil..plenty of people have been campaigning on this for years...but as usual no one wanted to know or cared enough. Anyone who brought the issue up was branded a button. Just like plastic

2252 2018-09-18 19:03:19 There's a little bottle of anise oil at home and it really makes me want to make like strong licorice gummies or like grind some anise and make tea or something aaa I love licorice~
2253 2018-09-18 19:03:18 @Asad_Umar: One humble request from Professional Pakistani (eng's working under Adnoc oil &gas sector), almost all Pakistani have been removed from services without no proper reason except giving so called "security card renewal problem". Pls raise this issue Tom'w with official.
2254 2018-09-18 19:03:15 Crazy how much better my car drives when it actually isn’t low on oil. 

2255 2018-09-18 19:03:13 Guy brought me a Harley to do a wee oil change and stuff, couldn't understand why my sockets didn't fit. Then I twigged it was all AF......

2258 2018-09-18 19:02:54 I don't understand why ppl do that fake muscle thing where they inject oil into their bodies to make it look really muscular, it looks obviously fake nobody is fooled

Walking around looking like bubble wrap
2259 2018-09-18 19:02:43 A decade ago it was all about oil, right now it is all about data, next will be water..have you read a book by Michael Burry called "The Big Short"?!
2260 2018-09-18 19:02:40 Indeed, in fact I doubt they would have any oil and gas within their limited sea border.
2261 2018-09-18 19:02:29 FF companies follow the same tax and accounting rules as any other business in America. Subsidies are direct cash outlays from  US Treasury or loan guarantees or targeted tax credits.  The Oil and gas industry does not get them but the alternative "reneuable" energy companies do.

2264 2018-09-18 19:02:02 Oil plugs/clogged pores. Such a common problem but not focused on as its not active acne. Also, products that flat out don’t work as sooooo many claim to rid them but don’t. Thanks queen!
2265 2018-09-18 19:01:57 US sanctions on Iran oil exporting country is the reason why india is also bent to obey and stand with US by cutting only half of import capacity instead of going to zero as required.

2269 2018-09-18 19:01:46 I usually agree with most of your comments but not this one..I don't see any difference between alcohol and dagga...Many people enjoy a relaxing dagga joint just like a glass of wine..and of course the additional medicinal cannabis oil used by many.
2270 2018-09-18 19:01:44 This was medical from a dispensary. Capsules with THC coconut oil.  That and the hot tub really helped with rest.
2271 2018-09-18 19:01:42 First of all it’s not a 96 guy but my oil is always changed in a respectable time frame smh

2273 2018-09-18 19:01:33 I toured that beautiful facility 10 days ago. It remains an excellent college for our youth, especially with its new programs/training for our youth wanting to work in the oil and gas industry. Congrats to all at Belmont College. #belmontcountyproud

2277 2018-09-18 19:00:46 What money? Canada's oil subsidies are pegged around $34B. Include the taxpayer expense of the pipeline (projected around $7.9B) and then add a layer of burden on the industry with a carbon tax. The Liberals are  unilaterally destroying Canada's industry while propping it up.

2280 2018-09-18 19:00:22 I canceled my meetings today due to everything going on except for my oil change appt. The owner of the shop ConvienTech asked what’s wrong because he could tell I was off so I shared. They prayed for me and gave me my oil change for free. That really meant so much to me.

2283 2018-09-18 19:00:09 Hate supporting oil money teams but it’s got to be done. C’mon you stinking French twats!
2284 2018-09-18 19:00:07 great job, so proud of what you have done.  I hope soon to be able to move or it to be legal in my state.  It helps SO MUCH, I can't stand synthetic pharmaceuticals.  Nothing else helps autism but cannabis oil.  I have disability and want to move.
2285 2018-09-18 19:00:05 i’ve never known a tire patch & oil change to take three hours! WTF
2286 2018-09-18 19:00:05 Spearmint Tea Boosts Mental Focus! I often diffuse this oil during client consultations.
2287 2018-09-18 19:00:01 In a theatre when drama plays, ..you opt for front seats. When film is screened, ..you opt for rear seats.   Your position in life is only relative. ..Not absolute.   For making soap, ..oil is required. But to clean oil, ..soap is required.  This is the irony of life..  .!

Robert Mueller’s fishing crew was out trawling for Manafort, a blubbery swamp mammal valued for its lubricating oil when, by happenstance, a strange breed of porpoise called a Podesta got caught up in  net
2291 2018-09-18 18:59:02 what do u have? oil? that's cute
2292 2018-09-18 18:58:29 Do you think trump wants to stay out of Syria to try and sell Europe us gas and oil? Or he can’t control it?
2293 2018-09-18 18:58:11 When Walmart tells you it’ll be an hour and a half for an oil change.. no thank you
2294 2018-09-18 18:58:07 How niggas call themselves men  when they can't even change their own oil 
2295 2018-09-18 18:58:06 I don’t never wait this long for a oil change I’m slipping 
2296 2018-09-18 18:57:59 Got a new fragrance oil coming for wax melts, something sweet.
2297 2018-09-18 18:57:57 When are you going to get around to addressing #IllegalAliens working in better paying jobs these workers could have? You really care about #lowwageworkers bettering their lives or just political pandering?

2303 2018-09-18 18:57:33 It’s three minutes before noon and I already got my oil changed, put in work on my grad school application, and “interviewed” to get my job at Peet’s back.
2304 2018-09-18 18:57:18 hehe...sonko shud suspend that oil board
2305 2018-09-18 18:57:17 I'm a huge fan of this, usually use orange oil myself, but it should not smell bad 
2306 2018-09-18 18:57:12 I am really jealous. I know a winery I was at in Gaiole said the same families picked their olives for many years & they pay them in oil. The families pick enough to make sure they have oil for the year & then the next families come in. Fortunately for olives I just use my guys
2307 2018-09-18 18:57:10 After Jyothika's Idhayam oil, it is Janani's oil. May be more Olive oil in stock.

2309 2018-09-18 18:56:10 I need to figure out how to turn my old cooking oil into bio diesel because apparently that’s where the money at.
2310 2018-09-18 18:56:09 All the PIGS countries are fucked, while the more intermediate countries (France, Belgium, etc) aren't doing that well either. Only the oil rich countries, Germany & the poorer to begin with Eastern European countries are doing well, let alone *better* than UK.
2311 2018-09-18 18:56:06 Why not legalize,regulate and tax marijuana and prostitution.Most developed countries have done it,however much we pretend it exists and it’s a billion industry none taxed,why not tax them instead of adding 8% or 16%VAT to oil...
2312 2018-09-18 18:55:49 Q. How can you tell that a computer was built in Britain?

A. It leaks oil.
2313 2018-09-18 18:55:41 car wash oil change.. now i need some food n a blunt
2314 2018-09-18 18:55:38 Oil was nationalized and Britain's hands were cut off from Iran, and that's exactly what they were fighting for.  can't imagine a better ending.
2315 2018-09-18 18:55:35 But since it’s a solvent, not a lubricant, best to wipe it off after and apply oil or grease.
2316 2018-09-18 18:55:23 I’m getting my oil changed at a mom and pop place in town. The conversations are wild. APPARENTLY squirrel takes 12 hours to cook in a crockpot on low. In case you weren’t sure.
2317 2018-09-18 18:55:21 Note to self.. when preheating the oven to make a pizza.. check said oven to make sure someone hasn't left a cast iron skillet full of oil in it before turning it on.. #ithinkitwasme

2329 2018-09-18 18:53:46 Even when Nigeria was thriving on oil money we were still borrowing money to pay salaries. Stop deceiving yourself, you and I know quite well what this current Government met on ground in 2015. For more than 26 states owing salaries alone is a form of recession on its own.
2330 2018-09-18 18:53:36 I’ve never been one for levy out but I think it’s pretty clear he needs to go. Sell the club to some oil tycoon I don’t care how we win a trophy anymore let’s do it the Man City way

2346 2018-09-18 18:52:25 Fusion energy will return over 100x the resources it takes to build them, probably closer to 200x.  Oil is about 30x.  Solar is about 3-5x and wind about 5-7x.  Biofuels are -0.5x to 1.5x..
2347 2018-09-18 18:52:16 Hot! I would oil wrestle with you.

2361 2018-09-18 18:50:15 Sorry, but I have to interject.  We (humanity) have insatiable appetite for easy energy.  The oil and gas industry responds to our demand in a closed economic loop.
We are ALL RESPONSIBLE for the mess we’ve made, and for the solution too.  Plenty of blame...
2362 2018-09-18 18:50:13 #Exercise is good for your #skin as working up a sweat can help your skin expel some environmental #pollutant, oil and dirt buildup.

2365 2018-09-18 18:50:08 Wait a second... It looks like we will be celebrating $7.10 (OIL) Day soon!  $CVSI $CBDS WOO HOO for both of you!!!! $$$$$$
2366 2018-09-18 18:50:06 Was you Ukoger Ian? I said how pathetic my name sake was highlighting you on LSE. Seriously bring the good ones back to LSE. You, Im guessing and Adrian.
2367 2018-09-18 18:49:56 CBD oil helps my wife with this.
2368 2018-09-18 18:49:49 Is Trudeau colluding with foreign governments to stop the flow of oil from Canada?  Would be an interesting thing to look into
2369 2018-09-18 18:49:48 I gotta get me some coconut oil!
2370 2018-09-18 18:49:37 First glance I thought that said "Sandwich essential oil"
2371 2018-09-18 18:49:37 Open your hole i will put oil in it @SirJadeja
2372 2018-09-18 18:49:28 England would trade you baubles and socks for your resources, which btw DOES NOT include much of the Oil and Gas by international maritime boundaries...
2373 2018-09-18 18:49:10 Short squeeze on rates and reduction in oil positioning  = rally in 10y and inverted curve.... Rally in oil = Higher inflation rates/steeper curve. Fundamentals suggest higher oil given Iran/VZ and faltering US capex  (caveat being recent EM weakness) along with tight labor

2375 2018-09-18 18:48:56 Me a go buy some oil today...cause
2376 2018-09-18 18:48:48 He's cool :D
2377 2018-09-18 18:48:40 You need to learn some basic physical science. Global warming due to increased CO2 due to combusting fossil fuels is not complicated. It was predicted as early as 1895... and like I said, accepted as simple fact until big oil paid to buy politicians and mislead fools like you.
2378 2018-09-18 18:48:38 I tried my best to keep and open mind and read 12 rules by @jordanbpeterson . Had to return the book. What a load of trash psychology. This man is nothing short of a charlatan and a snake oil salesman preying on insecure men.
2379 2018-09-18 18:48:30 I’ll be there with a drum of baby oil.
2380 2018-09-18 18:48:27 My wife put "sandalwood essential oil" in our laundry to make it smell nice. Something went wrong and now all of my clothes smell like farts.
2381 2018-09-18 18:48:21 Meanwhile, centrists liberals and failed conservatives both refuse to even debate the proper step forward: Nationalize the oil industry.
2382 2018-09-18 18:48:16 #AngelEyes I think the President of Poland has questioned the validity of the illegitimate 45th POTUS signature and cooperation on the agreement here in the, USA 1st agenda EU Oil Pipeline
2383 2018-09-18 18:48:05 Explaining to our kids who inherit the hot house planet that our national "success" boiled down to putting more oil on the market is going to be super awkward.
2384 2018-09-18 18:47:58 Aye she's incomparable to when she had to parrot McTernan / Murphy lies. She was for a long time the worst politician in the UK in delivery and inability to communicate. She couldn't resist a wee lie about oil, but not as unhinged as Mr Brexit there.
2385 2018-09-18 18:47:54 Catch me on an NJ Transit bus pouring CBD oil into my mouth
2386 2018-09-18 18:47:52 Another snake oil and baloney sandwich.  Did you just EXPAND the government?!  How are your Tea Party banana-heads gonna defend this one?

2388 2018-09-18 18:47:50 @USGS would you be interested in our oil & gas drilling health and safety data?
2389 2018-09-18 18:47:50 Is this barter because both of you masseuse oil in your trade?
2390 2018-09-18 18:47:36 -Prices of goods in the CBD are far very much different from those ekumaTuckshop ekumaghetto..
*Choppies-2litres Cooking oil is going for $3.95

me: ok, thanks
2402 2018-09-18 18:46:06 You're being fooled by the surge in Chinese coal built in the first decade of the century, which has peaked and will reverse, and by the increase in transport use of oil, which will peak by 2025. But don't believe me, just watch and learn.
2403 2018-09-18 18:45:54 For sure...our suppliers had a standard order of 6 boxes per month. The amount that was required to make the oil! The hostel guys..
2404 2018-09-18 18:45:52 Do u use an oil I rarely sleep
2405 2018-09-18 18:45:42 You said it yourself other OPEC oil countries wouldn't allow this. Here we have free speech. I would encourage a balanced view like inviting CNRL to talk about their innovation or Suncor. That's balance

2418 2018-09-18 18:44:11 @elonmusk Do you worry about the limited amount of oil left on earth, is it possible for a rocket to run on something other than kerosene n liquid oxygen?
2419 2018-09-18 18:43:51 You are aware of course that there is already an existing pipeline going through that area since 1956 and they are just twinning it 
Also oil from Iran is being shipped by tanker through the St.Lawrence ,,do you know these things

2423 2018-09-18 18:43:32 As soon as I add Chinese Hot Oil to my food my taste buds instantly lose all salt detection. It's so weird.
2424 2018-09-18 18:43:32 We must do it. Canada is our freind . Why should we buy oil from a nation who dreams to destroy our dearmost friend Israel. Getting close to Iran is unethical for Indo-israel freindship .
2425 2018-09-18 18:43:22 Amazing that the teachers don’t seem to realize that the oil royalties is what funds their impressive salaries, benefits, and pensions. If revenues fall then wage rollbacks are in order.
2426 2018-09-18 18:43:15 there’s a little bump on my nose piercing and I can’t find my tea tree oil to fix it. ya this is really how it be
2427 2018-09-18 18:42:52 The venezuelan crisis has anything to do with USA interference but with Cuba and China and communist countries. Its now a narcoregime and people is starving and dying. So yes is the most corrupt regime. Cannot sell enough oil, as all the industry is in very bad shape

2429 2018-09-18 18:42:26 What does “sustainable” palm oil certifier @RSPOtweets have to do with worker exploitation? It still hasn’t condemned shameless #palmoil company @Indofood. It’s time to force @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner out of the market!

2431 2018-09-18 18:42:25 I honestly thought their time had come when Oil fell around $30 - but then they were able to wait it out whilst Permian stuttered.  On top of that, they're destroying an impoverished country like Yemen.  I guess their time will come one day
2432 2018-09-18 18:42:06 Kids these days their parents should sit them down and do work everyday Blue Collar work working on your car changing the oil, Tire, paint, Plumbing, electrical, office work, sit down and let him try to understand when you do your taxes, anything to help these kids, video games

2441 2018-09-18 18:41:31 Anytime I go get my oil change for my Infiniti it says full synthetic oil on the paper....... and it’s free.

2460 2018-09-18 18:39:16 Sure, you would rather go back to Govt picking up the tab. Who will redeem those Oil bonds?
2461 2018-09-18 18:39:14 Start the car, make sure it's got oil pressure then shut it off, need to save fuel.

2465 2018-09-18 18:38:34 @BK 
The fuel price hike across India has been attributed to increasing international crude oil prices and shrinking value of the Indian rupee against the US dollar.
2466 2018-09-18 18:38:31 I just accidentally put my hair into olive oil and since I was too lazy to wash it again I just cut off the parts with olive oil in it
2467 2018-09-18 18:38:26 I agree with Maanzo we don't support VAT on oil. Let Mbadi and Duale cut their salary into 50pc
2468 2018-09-18 18:38:19 Well first we have to get you corrupt politicians out of office, taking bribes from big oil and big gas company's to pass laws in their favor, cleaner ways have already been invented but you corrupt people keep hiding them for your bribes, drain the swamp.
2469 2018-09-18 18:38:17 Not everybody thinks the same was as tightwad Scottish Nationalists.

2473 2018-09-18 18:38:05 #EverybodyTalks Ladies, you don't know what you're talking about. CBD oil works.  Exhaustive examination by the feds has proved that it does what it claims. It's been approved in all 50 states. I have suffered from severe chronic pain for yrs. & I'm finally getting relief.
2474 2018-09-18 18:37:58 Keep in mind there's nothing creative about digging oil in the ground and selling it to foreign countries and that's all your country has been able to do since 1970. A wack giant. 

And you're going to re-elect Buhari.

Do better kings & Queens.

2478 2018-09-18 18:37:36 Further, industries (gas/oil exploration, logging, mining) all had funded education positions. People literally knocked on my door, every week "can I come talk to your kids about careers digging for oil?". This was their job.
2479 2018-09-18 18:37:33 Supposed to be some cbd oil business. They just opened a store right next to my bank
2480 2018-09-18 18:37:24 The oil is only a small part of our vast resources

The good news are, it is over. No more Moore's law. The business actually reacts, so "no one cares" is a bit of overstatement.
2493 2018-09-18 18:36:27 You do know they don’t use full synthetic oil when you get those free oil changes?

2498 2018-09-18 18:35:25 You stand in a wallpapered room, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a dinner table.
2499 2018-09-18 18:35:18 Remember, Nigeria currency was devalued when crude oil price in the international market was very low and crude oil export was largely affected by the activities of Niger-Delta militants as such the policy was useless since Nigeria is a mono-product economy just like u said it.

2507 2018-09-18 18:34:40 I swear to God that I will not step back in the full boycott of oil, our people live in suffering and do not tolerate waiting for another six months after November. The complete shutdown of Iran's oil exports by November is vital to us

2532 2018-09-18 18:32:26 Yes thats because you increased excise duty on oil.

2539 2018-09-18 18:31:53 If this tariff war gets serious between the US and China , Nigeria really gets to benefit especially as China would be looking for new sources of raw agricultural products . Just like in the oil business we are merely benefitting from market dynamics.

2590 2018-09-18 18:24:50 I feel the same way. I actually use a natural scar cream as an overnight repair cream. (It works amazingly well btw. No more breakouts) and I use oil as a moisturizer and bar soap with tea tree oil and aloe and jojoba. I also use rose water spray during the day when I get oily
2591 2018-09-18 18:24:44 If you have any Lavender closeby it may help him if you let him smell it or use essential oil of it on his ears . It’s good 4anxiety. Not harmful 4our animals if used right.

2594 2018-09-18 18:24:15 He's starving the oil workers. So that pipe dream of their oil industry saving them will remain so.

2638 2018-09-18 18:19:37 After several moments reflection, I've decided my two favorite scents are tomato stems rubbed while still on the vine and lime oil in the toilet. That is all.
2639 2018-09-18 18:19:32 Take 2 teaspoons of

2646 2018-09-18 18:18:45 If the MPs are aware that Kenya mine Oil then they should not support the even reduced  8 percent VAT on fuel.Kenyans are OVERTAXED.
2647 2018-09-18 18:18:31 I’ve had them: use a wee bit of oil to try get the outer crisp and they’re pretty decent. In a bun with salad, ketchup and onions etc, you might struggle to know it wasn’t meat.
2648 2018-09-18 18:18:23 Just prepare the meatballs as you like them. At the end for two minutes add the avocado. I just used olive oil, salt and pepper  have fun trying 
2649 2018-09-18 18:18:20 India debacle, you mean the 1 billion dollar trade deal?
Trans mountain was a decable. He should have nationalize the oil industry.
NAFTA negotiations are ongoing, scheer wanted us to just bend over to the US.

2655 2018-09-18 18:17:58 Excited about the brent oil prices, now and future. #DNO ASA generating solid cash flows. DNOs cash can almost cover all its long-term debt!

Company is fundamentally underpriced on CF multiples relative to its peers. I am expecting a positive reaction in the share price anytime.

2657 2018-09-18 18:17:37 YAG will NOT do renewable energy. The oil moguls would eliminate him before that
2658 2018-09-18 18:17:37 Still mad I bought a 25 dollar bottle of olive oil
2659 2018-09-18 18:17:37 It wasn't long until mom decided to rub coconut oil on my back to alleviate my sickness

But wait 

It was coconut oil BLESSED BY A PRIEST
2660 2018-09-18 18:17:31 Maybe in your Utopian Socialist dream world Oil is not moved by Rail. In the real world this is happening and will keep happening because this is the direct outcome of the pipeline decision.
2661 2018-09-18 18:17:01 I never knew what kind to get because I didn’t want to buy fragrance ones but I use grape seed oil for my face it fades acne scars over time

2663 2018-09-18 18:16:50 A prediction: Iran's government will boast that her oil export remained above zero despite Trump's assertions; never mind the billions lost due to the fall in her oil exports. Iranian people do not deserve the associated hardship and loses.

2667 2018-09-18 18:16:26 I would always go at the same level or slightly above. Never lower than the oil.
2668 2018-09-18 18:16:22 Ok, well if we dedicate some of the island to peanut farming we can fashion a press and do it in peanut oil.
2669 2018-09-18 18:16:20 @TheTalkCBS Wow Mrs. O is seriously out of touch. CBD oil has many great uses, including use for chronic pain, anxiety, etc. It’s the THC that gets you high, which is not what would be going into Coke a cola. Maybe work to end the CBD stigma instead of making it worse.
2670 2018-09-18 18:16:17 When planning a kitchen remodel, tell your contractor how you like to cook. If you cook with hot oil, you'll need a powerful hood fan.
2671 2018-09-18 18:16:16 Rupee & Oil prices will kow stabilise for sure .. you will see the effect soon
2672 2018-09-18 18:16:03 The Large Cup O' Olive oil, now with Sambal
2673 2018-09-18 18:15:56 @TheTalkCBS Please tell the ladies that the CBD oil is also a bad cell killer for cancer, I know someone who is reversing her numbers by taking high doses of it. Do not make fun of something that you have not looked into.
2674 2018-09-18 18:15:47 And they are responsible for Oil on Rail. My God get your bloody facts straight. You call yourself a news organization yet you spew this bs?!! Oil by Rail is happening, will happen and will not stop because that's the only option. Unless of course you know better.
2675 2018-09-18 18:15:33 A question for @AlbertaTeachers from our PEARAlberta@gmail.com inbox:
"I would ask why the ATA is having a speaker about the oil and gas industry at all? Why not a speaker about workplace, dealing with students, education!? "

2686 2018-09-18 18:14:35 You need more fish oil for a good glossy coat Sergeant. Definitely some grooming too. I think the General should have you running more drills to have you in the best shape possible for your Samantha. I agree on the overgifting too. ASK HER WHAT SHE WANTS FIRST!
2687 2018-09-18 18:14:31 Interesting take on thrings but quite frankly totally ignores the biggest single aspect of the last 10 years - stadium build limiting cash and oil money coming in to the game. You cannot blame GAzidis for that and all things considered did a good job

2695 2018-09-18 18:13:29 Can't saving wildlife be an end in itself? Why is the angle always how we profit and exploit nature (fishing) to try and hook people into caring. Oil exploration is bad for wildlife, and fishing is bad for wildlife. Try clean energy and eating more sustainably/efficiently 
2696 2018-09-18 18:13:28 Kalonji 2bspn..methi daana..grind them in powder form 'then take coconut oil ...mix this powder in coconut oil heat that oil for one min than store it in glass jar.keep it daily in sunlight for one week than start using this oil ...twice a week ... this oil even grows new hairs

2705 2018-09-18 18:12:30 If youre stuck in MN. You can buy 419 Hemp by oz legally. Its high in CBD. Buy a Nugsmasher & try making your own CBD oil. Take smashed nugs of cannabis, freeze in a jar of grain alcohol for a week, strain herb out & evaporate the grain alcohol in a pan to make RSO cannabis oil.
2706 2018-09-18 18:12:17 My little girl was watching and she thinks you deserve to be in prison. There’s not enough oil in the Middle East to wash the blood from your hands
2707 2018-09-18 18:12:13 I learned how to do an LOF (Lube, Oil, Filter) in high school.  and again in traffic school... and again as a GM customer service rep. 
Seems like a bit of a waste now since I haven't driven a car in over 15 years.
2708 2018-09-18 18:12:11 @ogundamisi @DeleMomodu everybody wanna collect part of the oil money at any chance they get

2716 2018-09-18 18:11:08 I note that you are doubling down on the notion that the head of @FDRLST should not offer a correction to an entirely false smear of a journalist because of something else done by the network that employs said journalist.  That is disappointing.

2718 2018-09-18 18:10:53 Shell Oil have changed there name to Shell Energy, the reason is that the future is not oil production. The Con's think that fracking is the future. how backward is that?

2721 2018-09-18 18:10:37 My understanding is that EOR helps, but with the new 45Q tax credit it's almost a wash (45Q pays $50 for non-EOR sequestration and $35 for EOR). But absent that, it's kind of ironic that if/when EVs/batteries reduce oil demand that could harm NET Power economics.
2722 2018-09-18 18:10:36 Is extra virgin olive oil worth it?

2725 2018-09-18 18:10:13 Who foots the bill? Are you charging the oil and gas industry for the climate change that requires new flood control or do you expect people in Federal net donor states to pay for mitigation when Congress will not step up climate change prevention measures.

2730 2018-09-18 18:09:35 Fun fact, a neighbor from my mother's village told us that his family was saved by my great grandfather because Germans were searching for olive oil (and the family would starve) and he suggested to remove the barrel handles so they wouldn't be able to move the oil.

2733 2018-09-18 18:09:26 The lack of investment in oil projects will eventually catch up with us. This, combined with #OPEC not seeming to mind higher prices and @realDonaldTrump sanctions on Iran, will soon make for a nasty combination of high demand and low supply. #WTI #Trump #Iran
2734 2018-09-18 18:09:19 Eww it totally looks like Oil of Olay! But, I'd try it.
2735 2018-09-18 18:09:14 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

2739 2018-09-18 18:08:56 Add essential oils to your hair : Argan oil, lavender oil (but dilute it with a heavy carrier oil before use) .u can also do an avocado hair mask :) try a herbal shampoo that has less chemicals ..
Also I heard that the water (even shower water) is causing hair damage.

2745 2018-09-18 18:08:42 My piece says it would be seeded by equities, like stock market purchases. The line that says oil revenues was interpolated by the editor when he merged a different sentence describing Norway

2757 2018-09-18 18:06:55 Hey @albertateachers , you activist pricks understand your salaries would be around $42,000/y without the Oil and Gas industry right? 

The only reason a elementary teacher makes $55/h is because O&G paves the way. 

This constant attack on Alberta’s bread winner is disgusting.
2758 2018-09-18 18:06:52 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles! Most people actually have eleven toes, not ten! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2759 2018-09-18 18:06:14 Trump has even made sure no oil rigs will be off the coast of his precious resort. The GOP is just in it for themselves!!

2762 2018-09-18 18:05:43 other wonks seem to like him, but he couldn't be bothered to get the facts straight about Bruenig's SWF. He said it would be seeded by oil money when that's not the proposal. He compared it to Norway's "pension fund" which is not a pension fund (even if it's in the name)... 1/
2763 2018-09-18 18:05:27 Foot in mouth is not only with single person... I remember rising oil prices, rupee devaluation against dollar and black money were mentioned by someone, who now does not even nation these topics in own speeches!! DUH!!

2776 2018-09-18 18:04:06 #EnergyDominance would include innovation in the #renewableenergy sector, not selling off to short-term pocket liners like oil and gas.
2777 2018-09-18 18:04:02 What a ridiculous statement. Oil would be moving on rail notwithstanding who owns the railway. It's time to get your facts straight. You have legit points make them. Keep the fiction to a minimum.
2778 2018-09-18 18:04:01 My daughter “Dad,olive oil is from Olives?”Yes.”Sunflower oil is from sunflowers?” In a way,yes.”So,what is baby oil made from then?” Silence from Dad,I feel like Homer Simpson
2779 2018-09-18 18:03:55 @realDonaldTrump If India only wants to cut off 50% of its oil, it is a big blow to the White House and will certainly have a very devastating effect on the November election. With all the respect I have for you, but this is a great betrayal for the freedom of conscience,

2797 2018-09-18 18:01:17 Riini you have such a pretty booty. I want to rub oil on it & kiss it. 
2798 2018-09-18 18:01:12 This seems great to me except that relying on EOR to make the economics work likely means locking in oil production through a point beyond when we need to be at economy-wide net zero emissions.

Then again, by that point hopefully we'll have a Carbon price.

2815 2018-09-18 17:59:59 Depending what year the model is, it’s probably a head gasket issue that can be expensive. Any Subaru owner, especially one with a WRX, should be extra diligent with oil changes and only use synthetic. #TipsforThaiMasseuse

2826 2018-09-18 17:57:45 Russian criminals are also active internationally in the illegal trade in oil, human trafficking, drug trafficking, trafficking in arms and nuclear materials and in money laundering. Communities should not act on their own, they should only collaborate with the police.
2827 2018-09-18 17:57:42 One reason why free college bad. Younger ppl dont understand ROI. 
Free college, how many useless degrees would we buy? I knew guy, 27 yrs old pursuing PhD in music  playing tuba. Already spent $80,000 told me he might get it in ten more yrs for a $80,000 job

2832 2018-09-18 17:57:02 No! It is the other way round - the US uses Saudi Arabia & Israel to police the Middle East in order to keep control of oil.
2833 2018-09-18 17:56:58 Well it’s clearly excellent branding on their part.

 I’ve seen people buy snake oil all the time, but they wouldn’t complain because they don’t want to admit they’ve wilfully purchased an inferior product. Are there a lot of negative Amazon reviews?

2840 2018-09-18 17:56:12 BJP lost Delhi election on account of high onion prices and could not win back Delhi till date. High oil prices can spoil BJP party more severely.

2842 2018-09-18 17:56:05 Old school coconut oil here post wash face with water.  (Seriously, I’m super minimalist. Lol)
2843 2018-09-18 17:56:05 Do you ever think about how raw water is the most distilled version of snake oil? Like they literally just hand you water from creeks and then you pay them thousands of dollars a year
2844 2018-09-18 17:56:03 same but for the smell of onions + garlic gently frying together in olive oil
2845 2018-09-18 17:55:55 I’d love to be an Omega 3 salesman, just so I could turn up at places and tell them “I’m here on a fish oil business”.

2851 2018-09-18 17:55:28 @Busisa74 the Industry Minister can quicken the recovery process by removing all duty on polymers used in manufacturing of containers for cooking oil.

2855 2018-09-18 17:55:11 @CMofKarnataka just request the MNC to give 1 day compulsory work from home and u can see the oil demand would become elastic...reducing the import and saving a lots of state revenue.
2856 2018-09-18 17:54:57 We are taking all of the oil out of the ground ! What would happen to the engine in your car if thier was no oil , I think it would heat ?

2863 2018-09-18 17:54:35 U forgot this part of the article: “Trump”, ...”has exceeded expectations on jobs and economic growth that were in place at the start of 2017. That’s due in part because of his tax cut, but also because of factors largely beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices.”
2864 2018-09-18 17:54:35 LMFAO its just baby oil ijust did a couple of swoops

2871 2018-09-18 17:53:31 Not with CBD oil that’s extracted from the cannabis plant. Some flowers may have very small amounts of THC but it’s possible to extract only the CBD oil.

2874 2018-09-18 17:52:53 I'm not on the team that made it. I'm just excited about it. And I'm building that project on my own time. 

But I'd love to have my old SL abandoned oil refinery scrum room back.
2875 2018-09-18 17:52:52 heating pad or a sock filled with uncooked rice and then warmed up, keep that on your tummy. peppermint oil on your tummy as well helps me. try to sleep through as much as you can if you have the time. i’m sorry you’re feeling this way love i’m just getting through mine as well!

2881 2018-09-18 17:52:17 My advice, divest wind energy. They are oil & coal linked. Fossil fuels & wind energy are linked. The major players in Ontario's  wind industry are fossil fuel corporations like Suncor, Enbridge, EPCOR, Capital Power, Veressen and NextEra. Replace natural gas imports with nuclear
2882 2018-09-18 17:52:11 I found out years later that a co-worker was avoiding me because he thought I was hitting on him. I was just really fascinated that he converted his car to use old oil from a local restaurant. I guess it was somewhat creepy to want to go to his house to get under the hood.
2883 2018-09-18 17:52:08 Yes 30p++
2884 2018-09-18 17:52:02 Oil change time. They’ve asked me 3 times about fuel injector cleaning. I’ve said no three times. Am I missing something? New wipers? Yes. Fuel injector cleaner every 40k? No.
2885 2018-09-18 17:51:53 If you want to stop or lessen the Hurricanes take all the toll booths down cut the speed limit for vehicles to 60 miles an hour stop domestic flights four times a month over the United States and there is other things recycle everything get rid of plastic and oil excetera
2886 2018-09-18 17:51:39 So I’m getting my oil changed and I had to drop over $200 for the oil and some some other things I needed. This white bitch is trippin over spending $20 on a new filter hahaha

2889 2018-09-18 17:51:17 Everyone getting excited about rising rates and it’s causing them to come up with a giant list of false narratives. Let’s see if the 10yr yield can rise when oil prices are not spiking (not on the list).
2890 2018-09-18 17:51:15 Since my accident, my grandma bought me a diffuser to help my smell come back. I’ve been making essential oil recipes to match smells that I used to love and forcing other people to smell them for me. 
2891 2018-09-18 17:50:56 well done Sue !! You have done brilliant photoes.
Move over Adrian.
2892 2018-09-18 17:50:56 So, when you shut down the Oil Sands and make Alberta an economic wasteland, who's going to "offset" the loss of the $12 Billion we put into equalization payments every year? Rainbows and unicorns don't pay for $7 a day Child care in Quebec.
2893 2018-09-18 17:50:54 Treat cash and credit like water and oil. They don’t mix
2894 2018-09-18 17:50:35 Old boats being the far more logical choice.  Old cars full of oil? Clever.
2895 2018-09-18 17:50:32 The conference is put on by a First Nations educational council, it's not something organized by the ATA.

And I'm sorry but the science is indeed anti oil and gas. That is just a reality we can't keep hiding from.
2896 2018-09-18 17:50:29 Taking a shower  when u have #eczema is a mission. Diff products when showering, diff ones for creaming. Top half of body, 1 product that can't be used for bottom half cos bottom half reacts to it, then stretch mark oil that'll never work but you can only but try.  A Mission!
2897 2018-09-18 17:50:28 This algae could this be the result of whatever they used to clean up the oil spill from BP?

2900 2018-09-18 17:49:50 I just wanna give her a hot oil booty rub...
2901 2018-09-18 17:49:39 rule of thumb is: makeup remover, wash, cleanse, wash, physical exfoliate, wash. (no wash for chemical exfoliate). toner. then your fancy skin stuff from most liquid texture to thickest cream. no need to wait long between steps just make sure it’s absorbed. and oil last.

2905 2018-09-18 17:48:56 Aren’t you proud that a US company, with all its faults, is trying to rid us from foreign oil dependance?
2906 2018-09-18 17:48:54 There would be a lot more turtles if it wasn't for people like your war criminal hero John McCain doing so much to protect the interests of Big Oil companies that destroy the planet, including turtles habitats. McCain may have looked like a turtle, but he was no friend to them.
2907 2018-09-18 17:48:50 I brought my computer to do work while I get an oil change but it needs plugged in and there is no outlets I can use 
2908 2018-09-18 17:48:50 Omg Ethical Oil, did Ezra write your speaking notes?

2920 2018-09-18 17:47:34 A Fantastic scene is being enacted in the country. The rupee is sliding down & is now considered the weakest of all the currencies of the newly-emerging countries. Bcz of this, the rupee price of imports, particularly oil, is rising everyday.
2921 2018-09-18 17:47:23 Anticipating the day when I dont have to wash my own car, go get the oil changed or worry about any other car maintenance needs.
2922 2018-09-18 17:46:56 I put too much oil on my feet I’m slipping and sliding and shit
2923 2018-09-18 17:46:55 Yes! Black coffee plus unsalted butter or coconut oil then blend :)
2924 2018-09-18 17:46:53 Choosing a direction..... this is just a corner detail of a much larger whole. #oilpainting #oil #oilonlinen #details #direction
2925 2018-09-18 17:46:44 has anyone ever tried oil pulling w coconut oil? I was thinking of trying it out but I wanna know if anyone had any good outcomes with it!!

2927 2018-09-18 17:46:38 .@SecretaryZinke just put oil & gas lobbyists ahead of American taxpayers by gutting the BLM’s methane rule, undermining taxpayers, Western communities, and the air we breathe #cutmethane

2932 2018-09-18 17:46:09 Do it pussy just be mindful that the oil pan sits low on those swaps
2933 2018-09-18 17:46:00 @realDonaldTrump India has reduced its oil from Iran by 50%, but not enough. We strongly and firmly insist that India and China should completely cut their oil by 100% until November 4th. In this case, we will not retreat a single step, never.

2935 2018-09-18 17:45:51 Where can I find a man that would bring me chickfila breakfast & would put massage Jamaican castor oil in my hair ? 
2936 2018-09-18 17:45:42 when you take your car in for an oil change but you end up needing a lot more done LOLOLOL
2937 2018-09-18 17:45:39 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
2938 2018-09-18 17:45:27 Despite the white noise from the oil industry, there most certainly has been #biofuels demand destruction as a result of small refinery waivers.

2941 2018-09-18 17:45:03 The white paper showed a public sector funded from those oil revenues. If it were the ‘icing on the cake’ then those future plans would have assumed austerity- a bit like the Growth Commission report now does.

2943 2018-09-18 17:44:45 Id gladly have a hard border with Scotland. what cycle will you use because cant use sterling & the EU have already said you won’t be able to have the Euro. Apart from Oil, Gas (which are running out) what have you got to offer the EU also get ready to pay for yr prescriptions

2946 2018-09-18 17:44:27 I thought this was a very stylish water bottle before I read that it was an oil.
2947 2018-09-18 17:44:24 Satan's plan is not only to keep our minds so focused on his world that we can't know truth, he will make us not even care about knowing it.

2950 2018-09-18 17:44:03 I used to burn the midnight oil,  cause Im more productive at night
2951 2018-09-18 17:43:48 Yeah they were super good! I used portobello mushrooms as the buns too. Came out a bit too slippery since I used too much olive oil but still really good haha
2952 2018-09-18 17:43:38 I’m proud to announce that I’ve accepted an offer to work as the Communications Coordinator in the @TechnipFMC Houston Office. I’m excited to begin my career with a global leader in the Oil and Gas industry and look to grow into this role with an amazing team. #Blessed #Grateful
2953 2018-09-18 17:43:24 That is the intention. Another pay-for-play Trump donor checked off. Business, industry, banks, oil&gas, real estate development and now defense contractors. The only promises the gop keeps.
2954 2018-09-18 17:43:21 Put lavender and a lil bit of tea tree oil on a cotton ball and rub it on there  2 times a day

2957 2018-09-18 17:43:10 Palm and coconut oil harvesting is an important issue for our family-run business and we are working with our suppliers and industry leaders to develop sustainable solutions.
2958 2018-09-18 17:43:05 Would it be naive to believe that SDF will do a good job governing post-war NE Syria and use the oil fields to invest in public utilities and services and raise the standard of living with little to no corruption? One can hope.
2959 2018-09-18 17:43:01 Oil paint ! 
2960 2018-09-18 17:43:00 So it’s only ok to do that with oil so executives can make more money? America can and should self sustain but that is a different conversation.
2961 2018-09-18 17:42:55 Y en aura pas cette année avec la secheresse ;-)
2962 2018-09-18 17:42:46 Excellent meeting you at the conference and sharing some of the midnight oil together on Sunday night. Don't be a stranger.
2963 2018-09-18 17:42:31 it's about what you eat though.  Proactive sucks and makes ur skin dry. its All about essential oils and castor oil
2964 2018-09-18 17:42:30 I be running through some argan oil
2965 2018-09-18 17:42:30 Venezuela's failure has more to do with its reliance upon oil to overwhelmingly define their economy. If you think markets shouldn't be "controlled" (the word is "regulated"), I hope the next economic crisis (coming soon!) will change your mind.
2966 2018-09-18 17:42:25 When oil prices halved did you notice the price at the pump half ? I didn’t
2967 2018-09-18 17:42:22 Congratulations on your new position as the General Counsel
for Cox Oil.  Can you please tell us why the closing of the Energy XXI Gulf Coast merger has been delayed?
2968 2018-09-18 17:42:17 They actually can't handle the problem of a border in Ireland...and seem set to ditch NI any day. They have nothing to gain by keeping it. Unfortunately, although we may be called 'subsidy junkies', they have a soft spot for us....it's called GDP and oil....
2969 2018-09-18 17:42:10 Free oil change and wash 
2970 2018-09-18 17:42:06 And the climate impact of the tar sands oil?  How will you offset that?
2971 2018-09-18 17:42:02 Poll: How many types of #Canadian Crude oil do you think there are? #oilandgas #facts
2972 2018-09-18 17:42:00 Masha Allah the look great. Allah yasa Albarka
2973 2018-09-18 17:41:58 Demons won't leave me.. I think I need anointing oil 
2974 2018-09-18 17:41:54 But Ted Cruz loves the taste of motor oil and crystals from his home planet Pkrassface more than Beto could ever pretend.
2975 2018-09-18 17:41:53 Blockchain is useful for money. Everyone else proclaiming blockchain as the cure for what ails you is trying to sell you snake oil as a centralized database would be faster, cheaper and would not require proof of work.
2976 2018-09-18 17:41:42 Those are also anxiety symptoms.... I haven’t had acid reflux or heartburn since I started taking CBD oil. If you pay I can order some for you if you want.
2977 2018-09-18 17:41:33 Wow my bf deals with this and I can never understand where he’s coming from. So I did my research on some things to help it and lavender oil helps. I put that in a diffuser and when he feels that way he just put some on his forearm.
2978 2018-09-18 17:41:27 Exactly right. Over here we don't have the THC bit, so it's straight CBD (or more or less). I have still heard good things about the CBD only oil, and maybe I do have to go up a notch and try a stronger one still...But the price comes into it at that point as it's not cheap!
2979 2018-09-18 17:41:24 Er, oil?
2980 2018-09-18 17:41:22 White Vinegar, Tea Tree Oil. And to make it smell nice, add some Orange Oil.
2981 2018-09-18 17:41:04 How do I grow back my edges?
I'm already avoiding stressful men. What else, sisters? Jamaican Black Castor oil?
2982 2018-09-18 17:41:04 That’s how I justify prettyyyy much anything haha “well it’s gonna last longer than any oil we get”

2984 2018-09-18 17:40:55 Thanks for the shout, Rachel. Let’s fuckin crush these oil money imposters
2985 2018-09-18 17:40:53 Been meaning to post this for a few days, but just want to say how thankful I am for good people! Last week my alternator went out-had to get my car towed-and the guy towing accidentally hit my oil pan and put a hole in it after he got it almost back home-
2986 2018-09-18 17:40:49 As we debate if Elon’s tweet hurt the people who hope his company goes bankrupt...

it’s a nice time to remember that the goal of #Tesla is sustainable energy/transportation...

while oil companies and ICE car makers literally kill people through air pollution and climate change
2987 2018-09-18 17:40:44 なんで寝てないんですか！？

Beto is a snake oil salesman funded by Soros and coastal elites.
2991 2018-09-18 17:40:02 In tanning oil?
2992 2018-09-18 17:40:00 Currently educating little old ladies on CBD oil. Happy Tuesday y’all!
2993 2018-09-18 17:39:55 I don’t know who daughter need to hear this but get a oil change 
2994 2018-09-18 17:39:47 I worked at a gas station one time back in the sixties and one of the attendants would smoke while he's filling up a tank. You know back in the day when we washed windshields and check the oil and check the tires and fill the tank. Looks like she hasn't spilled a drop. Boom
2995 2018-09-18 17:39:41 Jason, it's a race against time. The Iranian regime will fall, and people will be able to strike its name off the list of dictatorships. Meanwhile, even when Ottawa approves pipelines, it will take time for oil to be exported. Be prepared for what's coming.
2996 2018-09-18 17:39:30 Crude oil Nov18 68 Puts trade 141 times
2997 2018-09-18 17:39:18 Dan longs for the simple days, when an ex-basketball player would amble out, check your tires, check your oil, and sell gas.
2998 2018-09-18 17:39:18 @byamberphillips I can't wait to read your book on a reflection of what Trump did to the politic world.  As they say only in America can we elect a snake oil salesman & the rest his party would rather follow what's good for the Party instead what's good the America. Disgraceful
2999 2018-09-18 17:39:16 i love pasty men who look like they exude enough oil to fill an industrial deep fryer

3001 2018-09-18 17:38:46 Yep. It's a question of how to best explain to people total energy vs just electric. Ie in 2017 UK generated about 340TWh elec. We used 850TWh Nat gas (some for elec gen too) and 800TWh oil.
3002 2018-09-18 17:38:18 The oil spill cleanup at Tufts Cove was supposed to be completed by mid-September, but it appears to be ongoing and there have been no updates. Can the Environment Minister tell us when the cleanup will be complete? - @susanleblancMLA #nspoli
3003 2018-09-18 17:38:12 He must also get an oil for his head to look more shinny by bushra bibi 
3004 2018-09-18 17:38:07 I can't even imagine. Once I accidentally blew my nose with a tissue I'd put peppermint oil on, and I nearly lost my mind. You're having quite the week. 
3005 2018-09-18 17:38:01 I haven't made any vegan slip-ups for about half a year except for a couple of days ago where I had two slip-ups on one day! "What!? This drink has honey in it? Since when? " and "Huh I thought this place used plant-based oil for their fries "

3009 2018-09-18 17:37:29 Chai ... Igbos don suffer . When it comes to oil money, BBC will recognise SE, SE & Niger Delta. But when it comes to issues like this and female genital mutilation FGM na SE 
3010 2018-09-18 17:37:21 does coconut oil actually work on hair? how do. i use this? i just blindly bought a massive jar of coconut nut oil and now i’m stressed
3011 2018-09-18 17:37:14 We are actually destroying the world faster by not building this pipeline. See ya later climate plan in Alberta, hello triple the amount of oil on the railway tracks maneuvering through the most rugged terrain in Canada. Nice work mike
3012 2018-09-18 17:37:11 Rick Simpson oil. It’s a full extract cannabis oil and it’s seriously helping cancer patients!
3013 2018-09-18 17:36:58 They might be homemakers or they might be career oriented. It’s up to them. My wife and I gave em the tools to do what they want.

They can change a tire and do their own oil changes. It’s a shame some guys are threatened by that.
3014 2018-09-18 17:36:57 Happy about this change, but not happy that Canola oil is a recommended oil.
3015 2018-09-18 17:36:54 On purity part,I have personal experience. My son was allergic to all baby oils and other oils available in market. When we tried Patanjali coconut oil the allergic reaction did not happen. That was my gateway to Patanjali products. Till then I used to hate baba Ramdev.
3016 2018-09-18 17:36:48 They are looking for oil
3017 2018-09-18 17:36:38 That’s what oil sand upgrading facilities are doing. Carbon and heat capture/recovery. Spread the word.
3018 2018-09-18 17:36:26 Weh ada banyak... like legit it’s stated either oil cleanser or cleansing oil... but ok nvm hope your skin works well with what u just bought!!

one of Beto O'Rourke's biggest catch, is ordinary people
no corporate money, big oil, tied to his campaign
in it to win it

3025 2018-09-18 17:35:21 I saw a post that said “Idk who daughter need to hear this but ..... get a oil change” 
3026 2018-09-18 17:35:21 Here’s a tip: If you add a little coconut oil to the pan when cooking kale, it makes it easier to scrape into the trash. 
3027 2018-09-18 17:35:16 @robdelaney I read this in a car dealership while my oil was being changed despite knowing I would be sobbing by the end. Thank you for sharing, and I wish your family future happiness.
3028 2018-09-18 17:34:56 Some fantastic work done by our Art Course students today!

They were working with Oil Pastels and baby oil, to create a blended, painterly effect to their drawings of cats... check them out! – attending Art Course for Kids with Sarah Moorcroft (5wks)
3029 2018-09-18 17:34:48 @CNBC_Awaaz When bjp charged us more when the oil was 25$ then now how can they charged us more n they have failed in all direction
3030 2018-09-18 17:34:36 Yeah but mind you I didn’t have anything so I had to buy all the basic shit like spices, oil, peanut butter jelly, dressing etc.. I do plan on cooking every night if not every after noon when I get off, nomore take out 
3031 2018-09-18 17:34:26 My kids used the Proactive products and they did help but my daughter is now using Tea Tree Oil and it works way better.
3032 2018-09-18 17:34:26 No lahh ahaha nak cari yang biore tu jugak but its of different packaging yang aku beli ni. Also brand lain cam takde lak yang explicitly tulis "oil cleanser" huhuhu
3033 2018-09-18 17:34:23 Chicks be making driving snap videos with the check engine and hella lights on like bitch stop turning the music up and get an oil change. 
3034 2018-09-18 17:34:22 Why I put that wild growth oil in my hair  like it needs to get any longer and thicker 
3035 2018-09-18 17:34:07 So we all need #oil. We use it for so much. #PIPELINES are the safest way to transport oil. But pipelines need to run through peoples land and those people may not want them, and if a pipe does leak or burst it has the potential to do a lot of damage.

So what's the answer???
3036 2018-09-18 17:33:58 I need to start changing my own oil 
3037 2018-09-18 17:33:54 Really thinking about heading to the oil field 
3038 2018-09-18 17:33:52 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
3039 2018-09-18 17:33:40 Exactly! Truth is Buhari also doubles as Oil Minister - but like OBJ who held both positions in the past, he would find it hard to 'release control' over the sector as the bill proposes to do - in 3.5 years, there has been zero traction from the executive on the PIGB.
3040 2018-09-18 17:33:37 If you pretreat the container w olive oil it won’t stain like that;)
3041 2018-09-18 17:33:28 I remember giving talks about our historically conservative investment approach in late 2007.  All people wanted to talk about were: China, Google, Oil and Gold.  That basket has significantly lagged the S&P since, with almost all of the gains from Google.
3042 2018-09-18 17:33:24 All natural ingredients non color added and no fish oil I have a child that’s allergic and it’s added to most vitamins #SambucolStrong #sweepstakes
3043 2018-09-18 17:32:57 @MomsMeet A3 I look for natural ingredients like coconut oil, organic vitamins, etc. #sambucolstrong #sweepstakes

3045 2018-09-18 17:32:53 Big Ag uses 80% of water in Calif.  Add oil production, growing cotton in a desert, Kern-Friant canal tht loses 25% of water due to evaporation, So. Cal growth, and what you've got is a Cadillac Desert.  Good luck SJ County.
3046 2018-09-18 17:32:52 Good morning 
Hobbs and Sierra having breakfast with a touch of CBD oil. Its been a few days since they started taking CBD ,I’ve seen some improvements.
3047 2018-09-18 17:32:50 You ain't the only one. Anytime I'm around anyone that cares about me they will randomly wipe my forehead. It's annoying. It wasn't always like this so I don't even know what the problem is. I just be looking like I play in baby oil all day.
3048 2018-09-18 17:32:48 Getting my tires rotated & checked, then I have to get an oil change...this is all so time consuming I hope I have enough time before work to also do my eyebrows because they are horrible rn 
3049 2018-09-18 17:32:47 and yes I think la prairie is much much better than la mer.. when it comes to moisturizer but I do love la mer’s face oil. (L’occitane face oil is also very good & a cheaper alternative)
3050 2018-09-18 17:32:42 Can Extraction Oil and Gas make fracking fit the suburbs?

3079 2018-09-18 17:28:45 I came in for an oil change and they talking about some whole other shit. Just do the damn oil change and refill the fluids so I can go. This was supposed to take 10 minutes, I been here for 30 
3080 2018-09-18 17:28:41 Except #Brexit could be a boon for the UK economy.  British #farmers, #fishermen, manufacturers, #miners, steel/oil workers, builders and others would get a massive upswing in demand.  If companies leave - the market abhors a vacuum more than nature.  #UK #Euro
3081 2018-09-18 17:28:33 Yeah just like Jimmy Carter told the nation to turn down the thermostat in 1978 so we could save on the oil bill
3082 2018-09-18 17:28:31 U can use some of my beard oil it works great. Got rid of the meatpie I spilt in my Porsche 911 carrera GTS sport edition
3083 2018-09-18 17:28:04 We were talking about budgets and this girl that I sit next to had “car repairs” in hers so we were talking about how dumb we are in regards to cars and she goes “I honestly thought that changing the oil in your car was like an optional thing”

3092 2018-09-18 17:27:09 The "truth"

Well the "truth" to one man is "snake oil" to another

Truth is all about perspective
3093 2018-09-18 17:27:08 My dad always taught me to keep oil in my car and the one time I actually need it I don’t have any 
3094 2018-09-18 17:27:07 We need to know why this happened. For many it is dealing with chronic pain. I have a disability since childhood that causes a lot of pain.I have opioids that I use only when I am in tears from pain. Discovered CBD oil and lately Kratom  which reduce inflammation that causes pain
3095 2018-09-18 17:26:43 That peanut oil though...
3096 2018-09-18 17:26:38 Will you have anything positive to say about our Oil & Gas industry?  At least give some thanks for the fossil fuel that carried you there.
3097 2018-09-18 17:26:28 £1.35 a litre of fuel in a country with a billion pound oil revenue, only thing you can loss money on faster than roulette machines and it never gets mentioned but continually increases. the snp support the increase but want to tackle gambling and alcohol 
3098 2018-09-18 17:26:07 Oil props up the US dollar. Our government hates other government's that don't cooperate.
3099 2018-09-18 17:26:00 All that shit salty and nasty anyways. They never change their oil to, chicken be tasting like fish & fish be tasting like shrimp 
3100 2018-09-18 17:25:54 I just watched the first episode of BV S3 while waiting for my car to get an oil change. As soon as I finished the episodes, my car was ready to go. How BTS makes time fly. I love

3105 2018-09-18 17:25:16 Is it the essential oil kind or just regular
3106 2018-09-18 17:25:10 Yes salted butter. In your coffee. Zap it in a blender for like 3 seconds. It’s amazing. I usually use coconut oil and stevia instead of butter but just because I love coconut.

3110 2018-09-18 17:24:43 @LondonMorning I listened to you interview about Electric Buses for London.  I heard Josipa Petrunic state that Diesel is not produced locally, but electicity is produced in Ontario.  NOT true,  Imperial Oil in Sarnia and Nanicoke and Shell and Suncor produce diesel in Sarnia.

3124 2018-09-18 17:23:20 Sorry if your feelings conflict with facts but all I said was true. And yes sharia/Muslim countries are poor, minus maybe 2 or 3 because of huge oil reserves. If they didn't have oil they'd all be broke.  Also they love flooding into non sharia countries

3129 2018-09-18 17:22:49 Hmmmm but oil is a commodity and so is nat gas. Rarely would price go below production costs.....

3134 2018-09-18 17:22:26 米での鯨油の用途は主としてランプ用で、19世紀の話ですね。航海が盛んだった時代に船内でクジラの油を使ってた。いまアンティーク屋さんにいくと、「Whale Oil Lamp」という名のランプがときどき見つかりますよ。あとは香水のベース。でもケロシンが出てきてからは捕鯨は20世紀を待たずに衰退へ。
3135 2018-09-18 17:22:13 What about coral reefs that are already dying and Greenland and Arctic that are melting... They don't get money off corporations like oil industry which tends to fund anti global warming propaganda.

3145 2018-09-18 17:21:18 I wonder if oil had been discovered off the coast of Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk ......... would Scotland have benefited by one penny? Don’t think so.
3146 2018-09-18 17:21:17 Strange thing, I went for an oil change today, and I think my dealer had intentionally blocked Twitter on the free wifi. Wonder if they got some bad PR. Still odd to censor.

3182 2018-09-18 17:17:04 Let's be careful!  Despite Unclos rule 234, Russia cannot ban all foreign maritime transit in the EEZ.  Only to reserve Russian oil cargoes for Russian ships. This is Novatek's project for Actic2, create a national fleet with SCF.
3183 2018-09-18 17:16:50 Maybe even some Coco oil too, shit
3184 2018-09-18 17:16:47 Are you robots with “speaks for me” they certainly don’t speak for the majority and stop being hoodwinked with their snake oil #Brexit politics. We won’t get #EU memebership, we will have to adopt the euro if we did & we couldn’t afford the members fee anyway
3185 2018-09-18 17:16:44 I’m so excited because I just started CBD oil for the first time to see if it helps with my lupus and fibromyalgia pain! I get mine at a local/online herbal shop called @LaughingLionUS if anyone’s wondering.

3189 2018-09-18 17:16:27 I've a very important question @dravirmani sir and @surjitbhalla Sir. If Crude Oil remains range bound at its current level and INR to US$ remains at 72-73 then what's the most likely prediction of CAD for FY2018-19 according to you sir?
3190 2018-09-18 17:16:27 If you want to keep producing oil then vote GOP

3199 2018-09-18 17:15:29 Behind China's benevolence toward most of Africa, esp. opposing apartheid, is an economic plan of oil and other trade controls.  And, no, China's influence, besides arming a few nation states in Africa, pales in comparison to European malignant influence on the continent.
3200 2018-09-18 17:15:00 6. So far in 2018, China has imported more than twice as much American oil as any other country in the world besides Canada.

3210 2018-09-18 17:13:49 Think i have settled on a fave way of cooking paneer, chopping it, adding to a baking tray, add tomatoes & anything else that cooks quick, mix together oil & spices then pour over the paneer & shove it in the oven, done
3211 2018-09-18 17:13:40 Why did my oil change cost that much........ rethinking my choice of having a luxury car.

3215 2018-09-18 17:13:17 Yesterday I ran a simulation on CAD and my estimates suggested that a increase in Crude Oil prices to 80 and the Rupee remaining at around 72-73INR to USD will result in India's CAD to be around 2.9% to 3.2% of the GDP.
3216 2018-09-18 17:13:17 @lopateatlarge Well of course the war in Iraq was over oil. There was no Al Qaeda there in 2001.  Dick Cheney had no interest in invading Sudan,

3220 2018-09-18 17:12:39 It is all a red herring.  Let's not focus on China & Africa dumping plastic into the ocean (let's ban straws here).  Let's not worry about over population in Asia & Africa, massive deforestation by palm oil producers.  Let us tax tax ppl over O&G that will be defunct in 50 years.
3221 2018-09-18 17:12:29 #SilentMajority

No way on he'll we are gonna let a Soros/Hollywood/NYC backed snake oil salesman, who wants open borders, taking away guns and higher taxes ruin our great state.

Portland tech sector, this is your image problem. Plz handle thx.
3225 2018-09-18 17:12:19 China will become a major player in the continued rape of Africa as its supply lines are completed.  I urge you to consider the history of China in Zimbabwe and Sudan (China owns 40% of their oil).  While more recent than European decimation of African state economies China rises
3226 2018-09-18 17:12:17 I need an oil change first and foremost. I really hate going to do that by myself.

3233 2018-09-18 17:11:33 Imagine that! And it didn’t even cost her a dime.

Just heard of one where someone got burnt with cooking oil and his mum applied a raw egg on his face and there’s not a single scar to show what happened to him years ago.
3234 2018-09-18 17:11:32 Getting the oil changed in my car....

I have a feeling they will find more and I'm not trying to deal with that 

I have a plane ticket I wanna buy...ugh

3247 2018-09-18 17:10:03 There are oil pipelines crisscrossing the US like a lattice. Why not put some rainwater in a couple of them and push it out West?
3248 2018-09-18 17:10:00 5. China has emerged as the top consumer of crude oil from the US. American #oilexports to #China topped 2 million barrels a day this year – a trade valued at $50 billion annually at current prices.
3249 2018-09-18 17:09:57 I just read this sous vide recipe where it says to heat oil in a cast iron on the stovetop until “nearly smoking” then add butter and the steak to sear.  If you add butter to a pan that hot, it’s going to burn almost instantly.

3254 2018-09-18 17:09:28 Try peppermint tea and also lavender essential oil mixed with a carrier oil like coconut as a balm of sorts. Peppermint oil works well too.
3255 2018-09-18 17:09:16 And even without their oil?
3256 2018-09-18 17:09:15 Maybe give CBD oil a shot? I found it did a great deal of work with my pain issues. Really got rid of a ton of it.
3257 2018-09-18 17:09:10 just ordered the boss mood palette by morphe bc why the fuck not, it was $26 with a discount code including shipping. their palettes are such a great price i can easily justify it. basically the price of a gram of oil.
3258 2018-09-18 17:09:03 I too.
3259 2018-09-18 17:09:01 You left out the eaglebine impact. Seems convenient you would want to look past oil and gas impact on the economy.
3260 2018-09-18 17:08:56 The end game isn’t win win it’s re order of world power, China has high aims and Russia is behind them.  Gold backed currency is how they will do it, every country that trades oil and resources will demand that as payment. Dead Dollar.

3262 2018-09-18 17:08:49 India gives Counter statement for weakening rupee is crude oil price hike which is BS ..India drilling 2 mil barrels less crude compared to 2013. Also Crude oil price was much higher in MMS' tenure still rupee is worst performer.
3263 2018-09-18 17:08:49 Amen....they are most definitely back home now and prospering more than they ever have.  They have oil and gas finds that many want ...."the hook" !
3264 2018-09-18 17:08:49 AWESOME! Will the Aston-Martin DB5 from Goldfinger feature an in dash radar, front machine guns, read oil slicks, rotating license plates, and an ejection seat?!  
3265 2018-09-18 17:08:44 Congress blames BJP for not being able to control rising fuel prices. But what it doesn't reveal to public is how unsuccessful Congress was when it came to controlling fuel prices when it was in power. #JPJantaDal appeals to all parties to discuss ways to decrease oil prices.
3266 2018-09-18 17:08:40 I’m working on being my own bf to open up my coconut oil jar everyday for me. #thatsreallove I don’t have strong hands

3271 2018-09-18 17:07:42 The saying, "Get rich or die trying," came from a rapper who goes by the name "50 Cents;" and I have came up with a saying that could summarize the actions of the people who are controlling America, and (the oil thieves) the U.S. military: "get richer and die out of time."
3272 2018-09-18 17:07:40 I HATEEEEE with a passion when dudes make everything sexual, me saying my head hurts is not the ok for you to feel like it’s ok to say well you need me to rub your body down in oil 
3273 2018-09-18 17:07:39 You’re calling us socialist? We don’t have your kind of government bailouts or calls to the Saudi monarchy to control the price of oil.

3275 2018-09-18 17:07:23 Maybe because Rauf is lying. It is 228k per day that govt pays. Engro cost is 200 per day to convert LNG to gas. Oil lobby has paid klasra
3276 2018-09-18 17:07:11 And when the whole world boycotted Pakistan for its nuclear program and imposed sanctions to hurt their economy, Saudi Arabia stood by them and provided them with 50,000 barrels per day of free oil to help them cope with the economic sanctions.
They are closer than you think.

3278 2018-09-18 17:07:03 A valid apprehension indeed. Luckily I had a job as a fish fryman when I was in high School. So I'm well accustomed to the nuance of frying fish. With a stout beer batter you've got to treat it like you're using oil thats been in the frier WAY too long.

And with oil prices on the rebound. And a boom driven by Keystone and EPA deregulation. @TedCruz WINS BIG!
3285 2018-09-18 17:05:42 Me: “no checks please, just a standard oil change.”
@mrlube: “but don’t you want a 59cent air filter for $98?”
Me: “like I said, no checks. I have a mechanic. Just an oil change”
Mr.Lube: “okay, but we can change your head light for $87”
Me: “...this coffee is free right?”
3286 2018-09-18 17:05:22 Cool the hot oil treatment.
3287 2018-09-18 17:05:19 I seem to recall the YES campaign making the point that high oil revenues would be the icing on the cake, and since they fluctuated we had to treat it as that. Oil revenues certainly fell, but they're on the way up again. They fluctuate - I think everyone knew that.
3288 2018-09-18 17:05:03 Ok so we are allowed to cultivate weed in our homes but can we process that weed into oil & sell that without risking jail and possible gang rape?
3289 2018-09-18 17:05:00 4. A #tradewar w/China cuts on 2 fronts specifically for US energy companies. First, if Beijing follows through with 25% tariffs on crude oil & products, it effectively shuts our producers out of the world’s fastest-growing energy market. China will find cheaper alt supplies.

3292 2018-09-18 17:04:34 China is using African sport as a focus for its aggressive global soft-power agenda. For the 2010 AFCON in Angola four venues were built by China as part of a $600 million aid package. This “stadium diplomacy” isn’t a coincidence. Angola is now China’s leading oil supplier

3295 2018-09-18 17:04:06 We all know any figures are totally false though given they were estimated with an extra 30 billion in oil revenue. Take that away and it’s a very bleak outlook.

3297 2018-09-18 17:04:01 Hjelp. Dette er snake oil evidence. I realiteten en observasjonsstudie med historiske kontroller.  Klassisk very low quality of evidence med very high risk of bias.

3322 2018-09-18 17:01:15 Did you know that automotive oil absorbs harmful debris, such as carbon, and moves it safely to the oil filter where it becomes trapped before it can cause serious problems to your vehicle.
3323 2018-09-18 17:01:08 That sucks Can you get CBD oil there? I've started experimenting with it for my own painsomnia and it appears to possibly be helping.

3326 2018-09-18 17:01:02 Energy supply is a social and environmental justice issue. When nuclear plants shut down, they are primarily replaced by fossil fuels, which means that disadvantaged communities get even more oil and gas facilities. Vs. Nuclear communities, which typically love their plants.

3336 2018-09-18 17:00:02 3. The challenge for American producers is that the domestic refining industry is at capacity, which means every incremental barrel of #shale #oil produced must be exported to markets outside the United States. A #tradewar threatens to shut the door on those #Export markets.

3355 2018-09-18 16:58:09 Yes if in opposition they can dictate oil prices then when in govt they could have buried all scams from media after 4 years if we can't control we are a fit case of slavery

3367 2018-09-18 16:57:20 Alaska receives our revenues from the oil, fish, and transportation industries. China receives 40% of Alaskan salmon exports, 54% of Alaskan cod, as well as other fish & crab. The tariffs equate to nearly $1 billion for the AK economy that you are destroying just in fish exports.
3368 2018-09-18 16:57:07 What agenda? To let Muslims wipe out Jews and Christians across Mid East while Jews have a tiny piece of land in only place in Mid East with zero oil? Thats the plan?

You are being misled and manipulated.
Make peace with yourself.
3369 2018-09-18 16:57:02 It would be nice to know what @LeonaAlleslev really stands for. 

Is she for or against running multi billion dollar deficits? 

Is she for or against phasing out the oil sands? 

Is she for or against a carbon tax?

Conservative voters deserve to get those answers.
3370 2018-09-18 16:56:59 #MyWeirdRoommate had no problem telling me to have my friends park their oil dripping cars in the grass, when on the driveway they should not turn the steering wheel when the car is not moving because it leaves tire marks, but they had no problem drinking my milk without asking.

3374 2018-09-18 16:56:23 Perhaps that was not the reason No voters voted No - so they don't feel deceived.  But I agree that that line it has proved to be a load of rubbish.  Perhaps Yes voters feel deceived because oil revenues aren't what the Yes campaign promised?
3375 2018-09-18 16:56:23 My skin is fine with it and I use the tiniest amount but I think as they can cause sensitivity and irritation the advice is normally to mix with a carrier oil (I also do this - with coconut oil). However I’m not a Essential Oils expert or distributor so they are best to advise.
3376 2018-09-18 16:56:18 WTI oil at $69.79/barrel, +$0.89.
3377 2018-09-18 16:56:17 Hear, hear. I really wish CBD oil had worked on my Fibro pain, but it didn't seem to do a thing, whilst I know it does help so many. Given a choice between that or the tramadol I am currently on, I'd opt for the former every time if I could.
3378 2018-09-18 16:56:12 All of the above and then some. We used to dig “underground forts”, basically big holes we’d cover w/ leafy branches for a roof. Easiest to dig in the oil dump of a local garage; Soil was so soft... it was even malleable. An apartment house now on that ground (no cleanup ever!!)

3381 2018-09-18 16:56:00 As a kid I slapped Adam Bomb on the back as he was coming to the ring and I was convinced that the oil he had all over him was radioactive and being a wrestling fan as a kid was the best.
3382 2018-09-18 16:55:58 Ah .. yes no child or fetus should be killed until old enough to send into useless .... sitting duck ... scenarios in hot pursuit of oil for someone else's gain.
3383 2018-09-18 16:55:52 I think we could get 55 vs the USD, inflation could go to 7.5% - 8% (storm, dollar, oil), then GDP for the 3rd quarter might drop to below 6% as consumption component will weaken then interest rates might go to 4.5% - 5% in the next few months as well.

3388 2018-09-18 16:55:36 Because why make electric vehicles affordable to the general public. Let’s either make families cram into a mini-size car or be slaves to the oil companies. #priorities
3389 2018-09-18 16:55:29 I'm sorry but the oil industry doesn't control every aspect of the lives of every Albertan. All that free speech stuff sure does disappear when convenient though.
3390 2018-09-18 16:55:28 I need my oil changed and I don’t want to pay for it
3391 2018-09-18 16:55:28 This won’t be a problem. Some strain will be taken off the grid from not using electricity to refine oil into gasoline. Furthermore, most EVs can be charged off peak during low demand. This evens out the demand while not requiring new generating units to be built.
3392 2018-09-18 16:55:22 I’m impressed, you scoured the internet to find the one article that supports your view.  For me it was on the second page of my search.  Bet you didn’t read the article though, the rating was made when oil was at the lowest ever.  It has not been close to that low ever since.
3393 2018-09-18 16:55:15 Calgary, where do you buy your cbd oil in the city

3395 2018-09-18 16:55:00 2. The result could be devastating to the booming US oil sector, which is producing at a record level of nearly 11 million b/d & is on pace to become the world’s largest oil producer next year.

3399 2018-09-18 16:54:41 I heard it was dangerous to apply oil like that so close to the eyes tho
3400 2018-09-18 16:54:40 “oil” sent me

3423 2018-09-18 16:51:37 Yes, you're not good at handling analogies that subvert your argument.

3464 2018-09-18 16:47:13 Absolutely, but setbacks are a very blunt tool. If voters want to ban oil & gas drilling then that should be on the ballot.  No one is against health & safety but ignoring property rights without compensation to push other agendas under the safety guise is a dangerous path.

3466 2018-09-18 16:46:56 #RDSB up 1.3% is a sizeable move compared to usual fodder. Looks like pushing up and I assume Oil Price related. With such a heavy weighting it often pulls FTSE100 with it but so many other Megacaps dropped a smidge this didn't happen.

By gifting this cash cow, I suppose, the idea is to reduce Chechnya's dependence on federal handouts.
3469 2018-09-18 16:46:14 Frankly, I don’t think he was as attuned to the oil industry as one might have assumed. After all, the Bakken was going in about 2005/6 if memory serves.

3586 2018-09-18 16:33:19 Part of the problem with #Sens fans is they don't realize players don't play forever, and the team hasn't really been around long enough to show that. Bruins lost Orr/oil lost Gretzky/leafs lost gilmour/list goes on
3587 2018-09-18 16:33:18 I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,
and I have torn my soul apart, from
pulling artlessly with fool commands.
Some nights
I just never go to sleep at all,
and I stand,
3588 2018-09-18 16:33:10 Politics and honesty is like oil and water
3589 2018-09-18 16:33:04 This man better stop finding everything wrong with my car, oil change only please 
3590 2018-09-18 16:33:02 Yes the coconut oil too 
3591 2018-09-18 16:33:00 Dead easy oil changes. I was gutted to only drop say 6 litres when the car took around 8.3 litres. So 6 monthly oil changes as so much oil is stick in oil coolers. If they come in red hot, maybe 7 litres will drop out. Annoying!
3592 2018-09-18 16:32:58 brb going to hide in a corner, i’m literally crying in the fucking dining hall over having to go get my oil changed on my own tomorrow bc i’m scared to talk to people and have no idea what i’m doing
3593 2018-09-18 16:32:54 Sadie just taking all my lil money today  Oil change , filters , and tire rotation and I guess I might as well put her on full too and oh not to mention car payment  lol can’t be mad bc she keep me rolling  
3594 2018-09-18 16:32:51 lol people actually pay attention to scammers that's so 1950's like the snake oil salesmen
3595 2018-09-18 16:32:40 Aku team b saat ini. Muka w oily juga, tp kalau pake oil lg jadi gak terlalu minyakan mukanya. Cocok2an sih
3596 2018-09-18 16:32:35 There are a multitude of "useful idiots" selling us all snake oil - it all depends on your perspective
3597 2018-09-18 16:32:29 Pres Assad of Syria- Perhaps selling Idlib with development right to Turkey is better that just losing... These Funds are greatly needed to rebuild Syria...to get your oil wells out east running... Maybe Israel will buy Golan Heights paying Syria for use & development... Legally!
3598 2018-09-18 16:32:16 I really spent 70 dollars on @mydrunkelephant Marula Oil.... And my bottle is really missing!!!!!!!!! 
3599 2018-09-18 16:32:11 omg i do like the bare minimum lol...i remove all my makeup with coconut oil, wash my face with cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, spray my face with rose water and that’s it !  the less you do to your face the better it will be ! oh and try not to touch your face as much !
3600 2018-09-18 16:32:05 OIL ON THE ROAD!

3602 2018-09-18 16:31:15 Rosie, dont take anything about uer health lightly now that u have learnt ur lesson. Try to take that ring off with oil.
3603 2018-09-18 16:31:12 But his points are very important, no matter how the 3rd India sees Namo's work. How does it hurt in 2019 if these issues are addressed? They're not related to oil prices. I have the belief that @narendramodi has some plans up his sleeves that he's not revealing yet.
3604 2018-09-18 16:31:09 Use some vasaline or oil or butter
3605 2018-09-18 16:31:01 #ClubofRome espoused such silliness in the 1970s under the label #TheEndofGrowth .. limited oil, limited resources, supply shortages by 1990s etc ..

3607 2018-09-18 16:30:44 I worked the Oil Fields in North Dakota and flew first class from St.Paul to Atlanta. I was in work stained jeans and a hoodie. I was questioned 20 times for my ticket. This was 2012, and its ok, because I looked like an asshole. Maybe people were just doing their job?
3608 2018-09-18 16:30:44 Ask how much Oil Norway has extracted compared to Scotland? Seeing as he likes to know his Norway stats.

3622 2018-09-18 16:29:15 I have to agree to the atomic power plants. It's better than coal and oil. But we have to go fully alternative energy in the long run. And it takes a lot more research to make it attractive for everyone.
3623 2018-09-18 16:29:14 I’m bout to start back using coconut oil.. it worked for me.

3634 2018-09-18 16:27:38 When your country is actually rich with the largest oil reserves of the world, gold, silver, bauxite, aluminum, etc. I guess you will also feel indignation and you will point the dictator with those who support him.
3635 2018-09-18 16:27:22 Lmaooo Nope getting a oil change

3639 2018-09-18 16:26:52 I spent half a year there in 2004, it was beautiful.... I didn't know anyone tho and anytime I tried to go make friends it was just full of douchy army/oil guys, so I didn't enjoy it much lol

3643 2018-09-18 16:26:30 I'm so amazing that last night I tried to cook for the first time since I lost him. Somehow splattered hot oil all over my arm and now covered in neosporin!  Sadly not the first time burning myself in the kitchen, but definitely the worst. #Stove=Hot

3651 2018-09-18 16:24:45 I know. Tried it for the first time when we were eating out, before the HF show. Sprinkle some olive oil and salt flakes over the ice cream. Almost a bit caramely taste.
3652 2018-09-18 16:24:32 ooh interesting! they sound like a good company! i definitely wanna try just the oil. my sister started using it and recommended it to me for anxiety and sleeping
3653 2018-09-18 16:24:31 If my oil change takes more than an hour imma SCREAM
3654 2018-09-18 16:24:28 Great question. I think that requires some interpretation. For example, selling a bottle of oxycodone is clearly illegal. But selling a product that contains CBD oil (not clearly stated in the ad) in a state that hasn’t legalized it? How would FB know?
3655 2018-09-18 16:24:26 On a snarky note..u would think being so incredibly rich, he would own a razor. Cuz he doesn’t share Duck Dynasty values
3656 2018-09-18 16:24:09 70's oil crisis. (age 8) Sported massive cardboard shell petrol pump to school hat parade. Beaten my someone whose dad knocked something up with fairy lights.

3658 2018-09-18 16:24:04 Regardless - it holds true. The comment easily transfers to oil. US is now an exporter nation, selling at full WTI price while still importing from Canada. How many times are we going to go around in circles? ANY DECREASE IN CANADA WILL BE FILLED BY OTHER NATIONS!!

3671 2018-09-18 16:22:57 4 you! Drink essaic tea (by a Canadian nurse & Indians super immune booster) even the capsules are amazing. my boyfriend was coughing up blood & in 2 weeks he was all better. Rub frankincense & lavender essential oil on abdomen and lower back. Works 4 ovarian cysts and cancer
3672 2018-09-18 16:22:47 yep yep co-signed, I’ve used for years and the mascara just slides off and then you wash away the oil and BOOM! clean face that isn’t dried out
3673 2018-09-18 16:22:46 The White House has become a revolving door for trump to waste time, feeds the multitude, and attempt to find someone who will buy into his snake oil salesman pitch.

3678 2018-09-18 16:22:12 The Oil crisis was another reason too, but reasons particular to UK weren’t not being in ECC, in fact that caused some problems as things became dearer after we entered the Customs Union.
Additionally we had our own internal industrial relations problems as I said Union Power

3689 2018-09-18 16:20:57 that's the worst part how is it safer taking opioids, if someone says I'm on opioids and the other says I'm on CBD oil let's take a drive, 100 percent of the time I would take a ride from the person on CBD vs. opioids.
3690 2018-09-18 16:20:53 Its incredible that at walmart it takes 4 people 2 hours to change the oil of two vehicles...

3692 2018-09-18 16:20:43 In 10 years' time, we could be recycling carbon from the atmosphere all around the world and making cleaner fuel that would not contribute to global warming; but the oil industry would take a $ hit, so Trump & GOPers in COTUS won't endorse it-a small start, or more storms & HEAT!

3695 2018-09-18 16:20:25 That all basically comes from the vegetable oils you use to cook with it. Use butter, olive oil or coconut oil, and meat eating would be associated with reduced risk of those things.

Yes, trolling Libertarians is fun but I don't know if that's the real point either

3710 2018-09-18 16:18:53 Hi Katy, top salmon fillets with a lot of microplaned fresh ginger (from frozen is best) and a mix of light soy (I like @ThaiGoldBrand) and sesame oil. Marinate, overnight, top with sesame seeds, bake in hot oven. Dust with togarashi, serve with rice, spring onion, pickled ginger
3711 2018-09-18 16:18:53 He calmly placed her down on a stool as he got some clothes ready from her bag, for after the shower of course. Soon enough he joined her, grabbing some oil and body scrub. He loved that stuff for some reason but it did leave a nice scent that’s for sure. Soft skin!!
3712 2018-09-18 16:18:50 But only EVs will benefit from a cleaner Grid. Most places this is happening. Even In oil rich Texas. The Grid is getting green. My power in Ohio is night from Illinois wind farms. ICE vehicles don’t work no matter what you do
3713 2018-09-18 16:18:33 When some sugar mummies are giving their sugar boys political appointment and oil blocks, you are offering ordinary 700k? I am insulted on their behalf. It is a full-time job. What happened to pension and health insurance? How many days off work in a year?

3727 2018-09-18 16:17:36 Im@on month 2 and he said this is the worst it will get. I never knew I had so much oil in my body
3728 2018-09-18 16:17:30 Absolutely right. They were fighting on the news media over Allocations while sharing the Agip Oil, etc at dinner tables in the night. I was fooled too. Kai, I will NEVER trust Nigerian Politicians ever again.
3729 2018-09-18 16:17:26 Did you know? Approximately five million tons of oil produced in the world each year ends up in the ocean.
3730 2018-09-18 16:17:25 Nah aku jg bingung

3735 2018-09-18 16:16:53 Stay away from sulfates. Get at least 7 hours sleep. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? for stopping hair loss. or related. How do I locate the true and official web page. Worth the money. How to get it?
3736 2018-09-18 16:16:48 名前書けたら、最高ですねｂ
3737 2018-09-18 16:16:47 It was the one I didn’t like. But on the other hand, I don’t like spruce syrup alone either. So I’ll give it a try. Another vanilla ice tip, olive oil and Maldon salt (flakes). Yummy!
3738 2018-09-18 16:16:44 Just drink cbd oil.  Forget the coke...  coke is bad, like who needs that much sugar?  CBD saves lives! I’m living proof of that! I survived my appendix bursting! 
3739 2018-09-18 16:16:35 Venezuela had vast amounts of oil money. Every other country which wasn't socialist wouldn't have people starving right now. They didn't invest the money in future industries. Companies were plundered and controlled by the state. This impedes the process of wealth creation.
3740 2018-09-18 16:16:28 You can probably put that "have you tried CBD oil" next to a number of things and it'd be endlessly funny. "Did you hear a nomination for Supreme Court Justice to replace Anthony Kennedy was accused of sexual assault? "no but have you tried CBD oil?"
3741 2018-09-18 16:16:26 Q congress ke jamane mein ganga me bahata crude oil?

3753 2018-09-18 16:14:48 I'll take that as a YES then..since 1470/72 depends which date you fancy. So, regardless of your ridiculous assertion...you're saying that YOU are happy to give OIL to WM rather than the Country of your birth ?
3754 2018-09-18 16:14:48 and as a face moisturizer use vitamin e oil before you go to sleep!

3757 2018-09-18 16:14:34 As any good lawyer (hello @manny_ottawa) would ask: Cui Bono?

Who profits from our oil remaining landlocked?
Well, first is American oil companies. They purchase our oil at a $15B discount every year.
3758 2018-09-18 16:14:32 Only 95% of it. And oil & gas is only 7% of the Scottish economy. We have other sectors bringing in more money (mind you, if we taxed oil and gas companies properly, the percentage would go up of course)
3759 2018-09-18 16:14:14 Im ready to go home man. Finna get my oil changed and go out south.
3760 2018-09-18 16:14:12 Your MCM makes his scrambled eggs with olive oil. He says you can “barely taste the difference” compared to making them with butter.

3768 2018-09-18 16:13:40 It's a dictatorship where one person controls everything. They had a puppet election. He disappeared and murders people. How stupid are you people. Their current situation is from corruption, a dictator, falling oil prices and dysfunction. Ignorance is bliss
3769 2018-09-18 16:13:35 I think the jig is up. We know that for profit engineered monopolized food industries, are all reminiscent of tobacco, oil, and all other forms of deceptive marketing needing campaigns to try and fool people into believeing that their product is safe to use. Food over stocks!

3788 2018-09-18 16:12:08 My daughter was dating a boy with a jacked up 4wheel drive. One day he asked her to help with an oil change.
Today, she is a UTI graduate diesel mechanic. She can go ANYWHERE on the planet and make a living. She is getting ready to go to the oil fields...
3789 2018-09-18 16:12:06 it means Iran is likely to be in the processing of bypassing American sanctions on its oil exports, leading to a higher possibility of imbalance in the market
3790 2018-09-18 16:12:00 You ever needed an oil change but kept driving 1k, 2k, 3k miles over?

3800 2018-09-18 16:10:47 In the stages of oil being produced from an olive..the olive has to get crushed, grinded, put through heat, and separated to get refined...don’t be surprised when you feel yourself in any of these stages...let God do the work in you so He can get the Oil Out
3801 2018-09-18 16:10:34 I think CBD oil is the only thing keeping me sane these last few weeks.

3803 2018-09-18 16:10:21 If we were there solely for oil we'd either never of let it go or taken all of it by now. We are in the ME as a force to provide security for both them and us, to bring aid and whatnot.
3804 2018-09-18 16:10:18 Oil Prices firmed on signs that OPEC would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signalled it was in no rush to bring prices down
3805 2018-09-18 16:10:16 Yes... if you are over 2, you should strip the fat out of milk and then add a little oil that has been coaxed out of seeds with chemicals and heat. It just makes so much sense.

3811 2018-09-18 16:09:56 Opioids vs CBD Oil? Is the TTC profiting from opioid use or something? CBD is completely non psychoactive, legal in all 50 states and sold OTC south of the border. Opioids are killing Canadians in crazy numbers. This is asinine.

3818 2018-09-18 16:08:36 Girl YES!!! Applying castor oil to my edges as soon as I get home!
3819 2018-09-18 16:08:36 I've said it before, but: Trump will set fire to the oil fields on his way out. He'll destroy anything just out of spite as he is exposed. He has zero concern about national security, only self-preservation. He is a danger to us all.

3850 2018-09-18 16:05:57 totally agree with erring on the side of caution but for the life of me I don't understand how a woman taking CBD oil could be assessed as being unfit to return to a safety sensitive position.

3861 2018-09-18 16:04:02 Dear Sir, a #recession and especially a #FinancialCrisis may hit the #oil market before your target is reached. The big question is 'will we manage to make an impulse' before that? Lets hope we reach the mid-$80 level.
3862 2018-09-18 16:04:00 #midnighthoughts ayayay! Eeeeeeekkk@!@!!! Prayer should help and Rosemary Oil too.
3863 2018-09-18 16:03:57 In #MarioKart he is a useless orange shell that targets and forcibly assaults Princess Peach with his mangled banana , leaving a disgusting oil slick behind. “When you have ‘Star Power,’ they let you do it”
3864 2018-09-18 16:03:52 i use castor oil and vitamin e oil. they make your hair darker and thicker and you can apply it to your eyelashes eyebrows and hair and it really helps
3865 2018-09-18 16:03:50 Holy crap...
Nah, it's all good, just dump some marvel mystery oil and engine restore in and it should fire right up! X3

3872 2018-09-18 16:02:59 i got into the oil too late , the slump kicked off early 2000's . that was when shell started to tighten the belt but they wont admit to that but we seen it happening on the workshop floor . i never got into the big money to be honest , been out the welding game a few years now
3873 2018-09-18 16:02:56 Unless oil heads toward $87, we should breach above 3.11% but with Iran and Venezuela production in play, can't rule out $87 oil

3875 2018-09-18 16:02:48 You claimed labour "stole" Scotlands oil. It's either the UK's oil or it's Shetlands.
Edinburgh and the SNP doesn't get to make claims on Shetlands or the other island territory for their independence obsession.

3918 2018-09-18 15:57:58 Part of the bond rally will come during the equity melt-up & the bigger portion of the rally will occur during next year's bust. We may have oil prices falling during the equity melt-up. More factors than just equity rally. Can't think too linear.

3930 2018-09-18 15:57:02 4 years ago today I drove home on the M77 and passed a farmer’s field where they had built a ramshackle oil rig like structure with a sign round it which said ‘empty’.

3932 2018-09-18 15:56:57 we got behind the elected official when they were reasonably qualified for the office.  this snake oil salesman has no business in the white house and has no idea what he’s doing.  wake up buddy.
3933 2018-09-18 15:56:46 Like oil to the water of the Constitution. Canada, for example, with its "free health care" for all...and its "sorry, no room at the inn. We can't treat you" attitude, which flies in the face of the Hipp. Oath. FTR, my savior is Jesus Christ. You should get to know him. #MAGA

3935 2018-09-18 15:56:38 Well, that's disappointing, although I appreciate your transparency. 'Sustainable palm oil' is somewhat of an oxymoron. Will stick with Meridian.
3936 2018-09-18 15:56:36 Our issue with the VAT on fuel is twofold:-

1. ERC pricing mechanism is not trusted - collusion with oil marketers is suspected. People don't believe 16% VAT should have led to such a jump in pump price. People believe reduction by 8% should have a significant effect on pump
3937 2018-09-18 15:56:35 Ooh! You just reminded me of another option, if the Blue Wave happens: we could become one of those tiny new sovereign nations that makes its home on an abandoned oil rig!

3942 2018-09-18 15:56:29 She specifically does not offer "health advice". It says so right on her blog, which you did not bother to read. She tells all about the crappy mis-education she received. How homeopathy & chiropracty & naturopathy are all just nonsense meant to sell snake oil to the uninformed.
3943 2018-09-18 15:56:21 Grape seed oil does wonders for my hair 
3944 2018-09-18 15:56:17 It’s still additional tax which helps pay for those “free” prescriptions.  Proves my point, someone is paying for those prescriptions.  Your parliament isn’t protecting you from anything.  GERS figures ?  Oil revenue black hole ?  None so blind as those who refuse to see

3957 2018-09-18 15:55:29 But why would the rupee stabalize? Oil is high, FIIs are pulling money, Dollar is strong globally, if it has gone from 64 to 73 already, why shouldn't it go to 80 - nothing has changed. The cycle is supportive. Will hiking interest rates make enough difference? intervention?
3958 2018-09-18 15:55:27 I have been at this dealership for an hour just trying to have my oil changed
3959 2018-09-18 15:55:22 I had to train my scalp over the course of a few months. Washing an oil scalp every day only makes it worse.

I switched to a sulfate-free shampoo, and started using a dry shampoo on off days, and now I only have to wash my hair 2-3 a week.
3960 2018-09-18 15:55:18 I need to learn how to change my own damn oil from now on 
3961 2018-09-18 15:55:15 Ridiculous. Pain relief comes from CBD, not THC and CBD is non-psychoactive. CBD does not impair, she should be allowed CBD oil.

3968 2018-09-18 15:54:35 Yes, but if a mismanaged state run oil refinery can be shut down for the aforementioned reasons, resulting in not a peep from the public, it will be interesting to see what the cancellation of a two day parade (which has no economic stats provided in terms of impact) can elicit.

3981 2018-09-18 15:53:10 This has been a week of The Un-sexiest Things. Call a plumber. Get the tires rotated and oil changed. Pay bills. Finish random tasks that on their own are whatever but create stress when piled up. I wish I enjoyed doing this more because it’s always such a relief to get it done!
3982 2018-09-18 15:52:52 The biggest difference in the different forms is "bioavailability" or how well/fast the body absorbs the CBD oil. For example, taking the drops under the toungue enter the blood stream more effectively than eating an edible.

3994 2018-09-18 15:51:07 I'm interested in taking CBD tablets/oil but I'm just not sure who to go to for it. The way some ppl explain CBD is that there *may* be a small amount of THC & it's not a big deal (to them) but I, too, live a sober life & can't chance it. Any resources you'd recommend?
3995 2018-09-18 15:51:07 Don't worry the tide is turning and the oil price is beginning to recover.
3996 2018-09-18 15:51:00 SF detachments that don’t actually use SF tactics, do extra training, and have improper MOS lists make zero sense. Are they just to give a title and the ability to put an oil filter on everything?
3997 2018-09-18 15:50:55 This CBD oil is really amazing. If you have bad anxiety, i HIGHLY recommend it  & its 0% THC
3998 2018-09-18 15:50:47 I’m starting to appear in energy and oil searches. I knew I was paying too much at the Petrol station!

Maybe time to go electric...
3999 2018-09-18 15:50:43 Yes, CBD oil can be pricey! Definately shop around and compare prices. I'm not sure what you mean by $120/month though.... Our highest concentrated tincture is about $99, but how long it lasts depends on how often you take it
4000 2018-09-18 15:50:41 I’m in love ! This is so stunning. The oil really looks amazing

Eisenhower and then Congress chose to terrorize our friend Iran because of oil.  USA nationalized industries WW1, WW2.

4018 2018-09-18 15:49:06 Or from some promotion from oil/tobacco companies. When I asked my dad how much he was making a month he told me with a straight face it was like 10% what was average back in the day. No toys at all, that's luxury. So comparing to the other kids, between all that plus...

4027 2018-09-18 15:47:43 I pride myself in taking care of my beard (beard wash, beard oil, beard balm, etc.) but the one thing that is always tough is cleaning up the neckline.  It's an art form, I swear to God.

4030 2018-09-18 15:47:26 Sorry John,  these are rubbish. We tried different times, oil and butter. They do not pop out as seen. They also taste rubbery.
4031 2018-09-18 15:47:25 Love it how all discussions of #IMO2020 make out that shipowners are poor defenceless innocents who will inevitably be burdened with extra costs.

4041 2018-09-18 15:46:17 CBD oil has zero effects of that “getting high” feeling. Clearly TTC and their “doctor” are uneducated in this matter.

I think my house is trying to sabotage me.
4046 2018-09-18 15:44:48 Nor me. Wikipedia: "a 1972 article states "what British maps call the Western Approaches, and what the oil industry calls the Celtic Sea [...] certainly the  residents on the western coast [of Great Britain] don't refer to it as  such."
Celtic Sea guv? Never heard of it.

4055 2018-09-18 15:43:07 That's really interesting! I feel like I hear this happening fairly often. Not with the milk, but people try CBD oil for one thing and find that it helps them with something else that they didn't expect.
4056 2018-09-18 15:43:04 i mislead you. it's an American invention. production was then exported to Canada. 
after finding this way of preserving corn for livestock, the inventor asked himself "what if i fried these corn pellets in oil and sprinkled them with powdered cheese?" 

the cheezies was born.

4059 2018-09-18 15:42:45 I remember the 1967 war where you attempted to get US to annihilate Egypt by attempting to sink the USS Liberty.  How about confiscating Syrian land in the Golan Heights to steal their oil and other resources?
4060 2018-09-18 15:42:40 I support tariffs on China. Gov. providing funds for green houses to grow out of season foods using windmills/solar panels to subsidize oil heating/cooling cost will help farmer to adapt.  No Tariff on NAFT & EU will keep our economy level & a market for fresh vegetables & fruits

4067 2018-09-18 15:42:04 Yeah, cut the recent $12 billion in farm subsidies, not to mention corn subsidies. Then, there is the whole fossil fuel subsidies to oil companies. Social security, Medicare? It’s already apart of our society and government. Hypocrisy in full view.
4068 2018-09-18 15:42:01 If you are putting the petrol prices add one more column of crude oil prices also .

4070 2018-09-18 15:41:56 We may even already have what we want in Syria. The original goal was to do this for Saudi Arabia and Qatar who want to build a pipeline through syria to the med sea. But we ended up using the Kurds as an ally to seize the entire north east with almost all syria's oil

4080 2018-09-18 15:41:03 I think someone who is fighting to bring a pipeline to tide water, and someone who has championed the Oil Sands is far from an "enemy" of the industry. The industry will die. Eventually. It needs to be supported while alternatives and solutions for the future are found.

4114 2018-09-18 15:36:18 Anthony, some mistakes are deliberate. The calculated incompetence then creates room for monkey business. Imagine how many quality control points those trucks are supposed to go through before leaving the plant. That oil has been converted into $$

4129 2018-09-18 15:35:27 I was playing "Dishonored" last night, & it's set in a world dependent on whale oil, & there are books describing live harvesting & vivisection, & thinking about it upset me so much - knowing shit like that happens IRL. I can't imagine *intentionally* causing pain to a creature.
4130 2018-09-18 15:35:23 Just got oil paints. I’m so uncertain about them because I’ve never used them before, I haven’t painted in seven months and I couldn’t find a quick drying medium. My patience will be greatly tested for the next few weeks. 
Wish me luck.

4245 2018-09-18 15:21:16 Inverted yield curve or bear steeping ahead? 

Eurodollar curve is inverted 
Real yields curve is inverted 

Hard to see drifting sideways. Positioning suggests inversion, fundamentals suggest significant steepening (mostly oil, EM less so). Perhaps we even see both this year.
4246 2018-09-18 15:20:57 It's sad how no one is aloud to have any critical thoughts about the oil sands in #ableg. It's either you're for it or against it. No middle ground. God forbid you think it could be better managed than it currently is

4273 2018-09-18 15:18:39 The refugee crisis can be traced back to the Obama administration, not to mention the Obama administration killed more innocent lives via drone strikes than any administration in history. His administration created more chaos than they ever fixed.

I have read the article and translate into Chinese. So CCP's ambition is to take stakes in oil business, gold mining and moreover the reshaping and development of Venezuela. The security is the vast oil reserve. They won't let go.
4317 2018-09-18 15:15:08 Since water isn't wet, is it dry?

4332 2018-09-18 15:13:50 You are correct, but this isn’t an essential oil. It has intense anti inflammatory properties and kills redness really well. Not necessary, just popped into my head and wanted to let you know.
4333 2018-09-18 15:13:48 More precisely, 2% of blend of sandalwood oil and some complimentary fragrance elements (explaining fragrance blends is complicated, but selected for scent as well as qualities for skin)

4412 2018-09-18 15:06:08 Bloomberg: Saudis expressed concern both about the impact of US sanctions on Iran & effect of emerging-market turmoil on oil demand growth. Saudi officials say that while the kingdom has no desire to push prices higher than $80 a barrel, it may no longer be possible to avoid it.
4413 2018-09-18 15:06:02 Why is CBD oil so expensive? The raw material is renewable. Not only that, it can be renewed VERY quickly. WTH

4416 2018-09-18 15:05:41 Fraud is a lot more than just a small fry for AI. Nearly all daily drugs money (same amount as oil money daily) is laundered through big accounting firms that guide the laundromats the precise percentages that trigger investigation. Who will investigate non rule breakers?

It was just 0.4pct of GDP in FY14 ( basically the previous government didn't make money off Citizens - they subsided Citizens.
4425 2018-09-18 15:04:49 It's not easy. Having a jar of coconut oil for the quick energy shot is a must for me!! The flavour combinations I've created with that stuff terrifies even myself! Best of luck

4438 2018-09-18 15:03:50 The evidence suggests that @justintrudeau has been far worse for the Alberta oil patch than @RachelNotley. The Libs have screwed up TMX, NEB and environmental assessment reform, plan to add major new climate policy burdens, etc. What has Notley done that comes close?

4512 2018-09-18 14:55:44 Lol. I’m actually very interested in the case. The outcome could have an outsized impact on how (or even if) oil companies do business in frontier countries. 

If the protective “condom” provided by doing a deal directly with the govt is shredded legally, then where does it stop?
4513 2018-09-18 14:55:36 There is no premium for dilbit overseas--that's a myth.  Empathy for oil workers isn't telling them their industry will last forever.  An honest assessment of the tar sands is that they need to be phased out.  Trudeau almost got that one right.

4550 2018-09-18 14:52:55 And TV rights is only one source of revenue.   Even when the new PL TV contract is taken into account, Bayern still places in the top 4 or 5 in terms of revenue.  As do Barca, United, and Madrid.  All "traditional" clubs not dependent on oil money.

4552 2018-09-18 14:52:42 The sooner you get into it the better. At a younger age you have more room for risk, so you can afford yo invest in oil companies or apple etc. I'm almost at the point where I can buy 20 porches without making a major loss.

You seem unaware what Sarah Palin was recruited to do
What she was EXTREMELY proficient at & well qualified to do

Hint
Gas was $5/gal 
She was governor of ALASKA
Oil
Energy independence
She reigned in the oil companies in ALASKA

Then the banks collapsed & changed the game

4564 2018-09-18 14:51:38 U.S. stocks opened slightly higher on Tuesday, buoyed by a rise in oil prices and concessions that analysts said made the latest round of trade tariffs on China less damaging than initially feared.

4567 2018-09-18 14:51:13 Employment is emerging in the private sector more than the public, due to the fall of oil prices. However, this is still nowhere near enough with many youth not finding jobs with high enough pay or seen in a positive light by society.
4568 2018-09-18 14:51:09 No bread/rice/pasta. I eat a few avocados in salads, some food cooked in coconut oil, no nuts or seeds, I take fish oil and eat fish.

Thats why Uli and Rummenigge are against rule 50+1.
4574 2018-09-18 14:50:26 Really? Please explain this "road to recovery" for me then. I have only heard of someone getting better with the Holy oil made from cannabis hemp buds.
4575 2018-09-18 14:50:23 Division in western society has never been so bad! 
2 "safe" topics of conversation use to be the weather and health. But now with powerful special-interest groups backing Climate Change, Oil, BigPharma, BigAgra, such topics r too controversial to discuss!
4576 2018-09-18 14:50:15 But no, the Venezuelan government has been one of corruption, money laundering, expropiation and bad management of such expropriated companies throughout the years. Undoubtedly that will end in such a crisis plus the drop of the oil price that kept them comfortable.

4584 2018-09-18 14:49:09 throw in the impacts of peak oil and taking biocides, fertilizers, tractors and combines out of the equation and let's talk high double digit percentage drops in food production, to the point where food exporters struggle to feed themselves & have no surplus to export

4593 2018-09-18 14:48:22 "It is required of my Faith that I make it, take it, and give it to the sick as Jesus and his disciples did"
But the NT never mentions the oil?
So how on earth can you claim what Jesus did with it. 
Even that he ever did anything with it.
4594 2018-09-18 14:48:16 so apparently Take 5 in alexandria, GLUED the last oil plug into place. Which messed up my oil pan, which has me sitting at the freaking place for forever.
4595 2018-09-18 14:48:10 It looks like somebody doesn’t like fake news. Imagine that CNN doesn’t appreciate fake news when it’s about THEM but it’s OK to create fake news and a false narrative every day about ours and their President. Typical
4596 2018-09-18 14:48:10 Corney, why do americans continue to pay tax dollars for oil, gas and coal companies to be subsidized? That’s why those industries continue to survive.

4600 2018-09-18 14:47:59 It sure is, and worse, its been going on since FDR was first elected, and then re-elected 3 times. FDR was for the people and began socialism.
Here is a partial list of socialistic programs:
OIL SUBSIDIES
SSI
SNAP
WICK
The original aim for oil subs. was to keep gas affordable.

4632 2018-09-18 14:44:27 It's in the Old Testament. Like I said it is spoken of 27 times. It is required of my Faith that I make it, take it, and give it to the sick as Jesus and his disciples did. It is the same miracle today as it was then. It is virgin olive oil, cannabis buds, myrrh and cinnamon oils

4672 2018-09-18 14:40:45 Presumably it includes the dressing which will be oil based.

4674 2018-09-18 14:40:37 Canadian economy historically has been built on homeownership and production.   We do not produce oil (no pipeline, China signed contracts with Iran) we are losing manufacturing daily ie Carbon tax --- Things are bad everywhere but Toronto is messed and will get worse.
4675 2018-09-18 14:40:33 Oil rises on signs OPEC not prepared to boost output.
Oil prices rose up on Tuesday on signs that OPEC would not be prepared to boost output to make up for shortages from lower oil supply by Iran & that Saudis signaled the kingdom was in no rush to bring prices down.
4676 2018-09-18 14:40:25 NOTE TO SELF: DON'T COOK SOMETHING WITH HOT OIL WHEN YOU'RE WEARING A CROP TOP YOU DUMBASS!!!!!
4677 2018-09-18 14:40:16 Sounds about right.

The argument goes: for now we need $ from enhanced oil recovery to make CCS economic. Gives us chance to develop tech, drive down costs &etc.

Later, it'll be cheaper / there could be regulatory incentives (eg CO2 price) so no (or less) need for EOR.
4678 2018-09-18 14:40:13 Also amazing how people want to compare Bayern with the oil teams, seems that fans, specially the new one, start supporting Bayern without knowing our philosophy, and now wants Uli out, without knowing that this man take a second division team (Bayern) and made  a top  team.

4689 2018-09-18 14:39:26 “Kennie” apparently doesn’t mind continuing to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize these oil companies, that say they just can’t make it on their own coz costs are too high, while they rake in billions in profits every year.  When will ppl get a clue.

oil fields lie in ruin, rusting equipment as no 'OWNER' demanded maintenance.

4708 2018-09-18 14:36:27 The norm is to have a refinery in an oil producing country.  Any idiot can shut down a company "Caroni (1975) Ltd" but it takes more than an idiot to make something viable.
4709 2018-09-18 14:36:11 Texas’ Petra Nova plant is one of only two operational CCS facilities in the US. Because the captured CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery, which is then also burned to produce CO2, my understanding is that there is little to no reduction in net carbon emissions in the end.

4833 2018-09-18 14:25:32 Love the framing with the inclusion of "TRUTH" below their forms. Very artsy. Fully expect this to be on prominent display at one of the classier galleries in town, ASAP. Perhaps an oil painting version? Watercolor? (The Plein Air festival is soon, isn't it...? I smell a winner!)
4834 2018-09-18 14:25:25 Hi,@shondarhimes ! After reading your story, “My summer of scooping ice cream,” I really like how you describe the way you have to scoop the ice cream each time. For my #FirstJob at Chinese fast food restaurant, I had to avoid oil splattering to me when I fried chicken wings.
4835 2018-09-18 14:25:20 @cvpayne With oil prices going up it's a good thing I filled up my gas tank for $2.50 a gallon.

4841 2018-09-18 14:24:47 Read that part of the bible that the priests don't want you to read. the Old Testament. That's the one that talks about the Holy oil 27 times. It is mentioned zero times in the New Testament. Jesus took the Holy oil from the priests and gave it to the common man which was a crime

4848 2018-09-18 14:24:13 I know I'm no oil painting but walking into town this afternoon,two younger males on the other side of the road started singing "who let the dogs out?". They were stab-pointing at me. Nobody else around. Wonder what they'd think if someone did that to their mothers.

4849 2018-09-18 14:24:06 Watch oil/gas prices. Once $75.00/barrel is breached, I think $100.00/barrel will come quick. This will accelerate the coming recession.
4850 2018-09-18 14:23:35 Andrew, the price you & I pay for motor & home heating fuel is set by NA markets (+ gov't taxation) - not by tax loopholes for Canadian producers. The refiners in Washington that produce much of our gasoline (some of it from @TransMtn oil) are laughing hysterically.

4864 2018-09-18 14:22:30 My  aren’t great. So this is when Bush Sr went in 4 the Gulf War? I still would like to see the UN reports. The troops never went into Iraq to remove any chem weapons during that war. It was more about removing Iraq from the oil supply in Kuwait. I will  after I run errands.

4870 2018-09-18 14:22:04 If we look at what is happening in the middle East today, and why is terrorism so high today, it is because of oil.
4871 2018-09-18 14:21:57 We need to understand better,  why should we export the oil mined at tullow yet we import the same?  Why was changamwe oil refinery closed? Why should we import things that Kenyans can produce if provided the good environment to produce?

4913 2018-09-18 14:17:42 Man, enlightenment is snake oil, looking for it doesn't do shit for anyone. Detachment, purpose and usefulness are all better ideals to aim for. Enlightenment will have you meditatating atop the Himalayas thinking "wtf am I even doing". You all read up on stoic philosophy?
4914 2018-09-18 14:17:35 We need to stop the wars and build battery and solar panel factories.  Train our youth for the jobs they will need.  Taking off subsidies for fossil fuels will drive gas prices up, but people have to pay cost of cheap oil.

4927 2018-09-18 14:16:37 The packaging of these things is SO infuriating!

4968 2018-09-18 14:12:32 When you just need to get your oil changed but you pick the wrong place. I pulled up to the wrong building then I walked into the wrong door 3 different times b4 I found the right place  now I sit and wait until I die of embarrassment..or get my car back...whichever comes first

4970 2018-09-18 14:12:20 Not helpful. Anderson Cooper has integrity, shouldn’t we work to have more like him, not less?
4971 2018-09-18 14:12:05 grubbiness of oil sources , and less exuberance of fiscals spent on building superaboudant workforces
4972 2018-09-18 14:11:43 And selling arms to both sides...The war on 'terror' has been tremendously profitable for UK. 

The government can't wait to see if any other oil rich countries need more freedom...
4973 2018-09-18 14:11:19 En 2010, tu as quand même écrit "c’est à se demander si le climat n’est pas en train de devenir le cache-misère du ‘peak oil" => crois-moi, dans nombre de débats publics à l'époque, j'ai du ramer pour expliquer que nous avions les deux, et que l'un ne disqualifiait pas l'autre
4974 2018-09-18 14:11:11 #OIL: Saudi Arabia announced this morning that they are

4975 2018-09-18 14:10:58 tu sais très bien que le déni est notre pb n°1, quel que soit le milieu et l'idéologie. Comme disait Jules, "Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt". Seule la rationalité peut nous sauver (c'est ce que credo en tout cas).

4977 2018-09-18 14:10:32 The oil will eventually be piped, too much oil for tankers. The children will benefit, more tax revenue will help fund schools, and give extra cash to local authority to help improve communities.

5000 2018-09-18 14:08:43 What is “blow-by?” It refers to the white smoke that sometimes appears in the exhaust when a car is first started. Worn piston rings are allowing crankcase oil to escape into the fuel mixture, so your car is probably also consuming oil at an accelerated rate.

5094 2018-09-18 14:00:25 Is that what you read? Because that's not what I said. Alcohol also destroys lives, it's carcinogenic as well, do you campaign for it to be illegal? Have you even read up on the benefits of cannabis? You don't only smoke it. You get oil too, which is highly beneficial. Google!!
5095 2018-09-18 14:00:24 That saltbae dude had the President of Venezuela on his twitter feed. Eating at his restaurant. Just vomiting excess and indulgence. While his country starves.

5098 2018-09-18 14:00:14 @KenDBerryMD you said in a video which oils to discard in your kitchen.... sunflower oil was one of those. If sunflower oil is bad, are sunflower seeds out by default? I enjoy seeds in the shell while driving (truck driver) keeps me from over snacking and is better than coffee

5151 2018-09-18 13:55:16 And Russia is propping up Assad for selfish reasons:

1) Putin gains regional presence in the Mideast to influence oil prices (‘s primary export)

2) Putin manufactures a refugee crisis to destabilize Europe. Putin wants a weak Europe so he can rebuild the USSR.

5202 2018-09-18 13:49:00 Ohhhh Lord above, my face feels so much better. I haven't done my daily routine since I moved house, and my skin was getting worse and worse. Charcoal cleanser, rosehip-infused oil and a mattifying moisturiser.

5209 2018-09-18 13:48:16 It’s more likely you sold influence to someone who would like an advantage competing with China. I would suggest the oil industry who will eventually lose the renewables war and sell crude to plastics manufacturers now that you’re dumping any and all EPA regulations. #SwampStink

5215 2018-09-18 13:47:26 It isn't wrong at all. If BB is okay with it and providing it, great. But also, a bit unnecessary to project it as a CRUCIAL NEED for her health condition. She has RA and all these products have nothing to do with what she has. People with RA use sunflower oil and live normally.
5216 2018-09-18 13:47:25 All the while Zinke is looking for more land to sell off to Big Gas & Oil or Big Mining or Big Timber.

5222 2018-09-18 13:47:07 The Arabs, oil producing countries, have total control of oil production & can dictate the price. South Africa & Africa as a whole has NO control of its raw minerals  #StateCaptureInquiry #chooseDay
5223 2018-09-18 13:47:00 It is being reported that the U.S. state of North Dakota alone,is producing more oil than Venezuela,as U.S. becomes the global leader in production.
5224 2018-09-18 13:46:53 He’s putting hits on them no doubt. Pompeo is Koch & they want that #IranWar to drive oil price up.

5228 2018-09-18 13:46:29 I just heard on the news that North Dakota is producing more oil than Venezuela! Venezuela has as much or oil if not more than the middle east! Thank you @realDonaldTrump !

5237 2018-09-18 13:45:05 Why does my vitamin E skin oil say “dries quickly”.... when I’ve been sitting here 20 minutes now waiting for it to dry...
5238 2018-09-18 13:45:04 Norway has oil, if we want we could buy your country, and there is nothing your queen could do about it.
5239 2018-09-18 13:45:02 China has melamine tainted milk powder, illegal cooking oil, fake vaccines, toxic air, etc. There are P2P and other companies that cheat money, there are tens of millions of corrupt officials, and some family members of their children live in your United States.

Looted people on fuel and never would have expected international oil price would slap like this.Four years looted money on fuel and managed GDP and manipulated numbers. Now on silent motion
5244 2018-09-18 13:44:32 Lol I’m using the oil lol. That and this other thing called “restore” for Hut health. And we take this thing called biocoffee in the morning that’s amazing for keeping your system rightbduring the day. Between those three, I’ve been feeling great.

5247 2018-09-18 13:44:28 Complete world wide economic meltdown will only occur when the oil price starts accelerating out of control. Odds on, this will be around 2030, give or take a few years.

There could be an earlier meltdown though, if the US dollar somehow implodes earlier than then.
5248 2018-09-18 13:44:25 Ok! Their comments were more scathing than the weak ass View's. And if we're keeping it a buck - Julie's only been on Big Brother this long bc of Les. Her personality, presenting and interviewing style mix with that show like oil and water.

5250 2018-09-18 13:44:21 This is a war for oil.  Britian has one Nissan Leaf factory.  One.  Why don't they have 100.   If we drove EV there would be less demand for gasoline.  Batteries would be able to store wind power, and you could let Tories continue talking; hot air used later.

5253 2018-09-18 13:43:50 Honestly, I did not find anything wrong with the special concessions in the kitchen like Olive Oil, gluten free bread or milk sans luctose, these are part of a healthy lifestyle that Mumtaz has, there are so many people who take care of their health like she does.

5255 2018-09-18 13:43:29 That’s similar IMO to the American “plan” - give them garbage land until someone discovers oil, or gold or silver, or copper or anything valuable there. Then the deal is off.

5276 2018-09-18 13:41:07 Equities straight up out of the gate, because as we know, a 4-5 cent move in oil products is supportive for equities as well.
5277 2018-09-18 13:41:03 Add to that, how much raw material do we have? WW2 depleted most iron mines here in northeast MN. Easy oil is gone. What's left takes longer to procure, process.
5278 2018-09-18 13:40:57 Coconut oil mixed with Jojoba oil (used with daily moisturizer) works for me.

5286 2018-09-18 13:40:23 Did you get it? If not, ice your hands to reduce swelling, and then oil up to slide it off.

5376 2018-09-18 13:31:45 Although reduction in swelling is fairly helpful, you can also add a little lubrication to facilitate the removal. Lubrication reduces the risk of peeling, redness, discomfort and additional swelling. Agents such as cooking oil, butter, petroleum jelly, soap or good moisturizing

5440 2018-09-18 13:25:44 Read the fact-check. Oil that leaves for the EU without coming onto British soil does not get allocated to Scotland or any other region of the U.K. it also states that the volume of trade is significant. This trade is lumped in a category called “other regions”.

5445 2018-09-18 13:25:04 Correct. Venezuela relies heavily on an import/export economy. Protectionism is very low. America puts their thumb on the scale when the country doesnt do its bidding. They privatized the oil and America funds the militant opposition party.

5448 2018-09-18 13:24:50 Put oil around it, so it will slip off. Or use any liquid soap
5449 2018-09-18 13:24:46 Maybe some drops of lavender essential oil on your pillow to relax your mind & make it even easier for you to fall asleep. Then, when you wake up a hot beverage (ex. water + lemon) while playing calming/uplifting music b4 & while you’re showering. Def helps me take on the world.

5451 2018-09-18 13:24:36 It is frightening.  The issue I suspect is oil.  There is a lot of oil in the Caspian sea area. Syria borders Iran.   Is this another "war for oil"   ?

5476 2018-09-18 13:22:43 Ok? And all the plastic in an ICE car is not made from fossil fuels?  You do know bioplastic is a thing, made from renewable sources?  Way to go in pointing out flaws so you do not have to consider any actual solutions.  How did humanity ever go without oil? We did and can again.
5477 2018-09-18 13:22:39 As long as you keep them clean and brush them out daily they will stay nice. And you can’t use an products with oil because it will break down the glue

5500 2018-09-18 13:20:09 This concludes my theory about the strategy on energy & climate change action. They pulled out of the Paris Agreement because they are taking the game to an entirely next level. Trumps banter promoting coal, oil & gas is a side show falsely propping up those investments.

5511 2018-09-18 13:18:57 For example they have stuck grains like wheat for up to a year, most probably other thinks like flour, sugar, cooking oil... because nobody knows what happens after Nov 4. If you ask me nothing happens. (:
5512 2018-09-18 13:18:41 Let me elaborate for it further for u .. in 2015 oil and gas prices came crashing down from 120 to 30 and Govt here was hellbent upon increasing fuel prices .. in 2018 global price curve is now upward sloping.. how can a Govt that is short of money not increase the prices
5513 2018-09-18 13:18:35 This is interesting. So Kenya Pipeline's oil loading system is also connected to water mains? The incompetence in this country is draining

5525 2018-09-18 13:16:21 According to the Common Sense Policy Roundtable, not allowing oil companies to drill or frack next to houses will destroy Colorado. I read a study that says there’s no way to make the claim, from the Institute of What The Fuck Is Wrong With You?!?

5530 2018-09-18 13:15:48 Not sure Puerto Rico would agree with your comparison. Cases like Venezuela are not ‘taking this view too far’, but rather not taking ‘this view’ at all. Currency peg; oil $ used for imports instead of developing domestic productive capacity etc.

5558 2018-09-18 13:13:20 I agree, but the industries have 2 work together 2 make it better. Canada imports way 2 much foreign oil from despots & dictators because radical environmentalists keep us from selling our oil overseas, forcing us to sell our oil to US at a discount, meaning less $$ for research

5568 2018-09-18 13:12:21 I'm sure it is. The kicker for me was the getting wine spots out! Olive oil doesn't do that. :)

5574 2018-09-18 13:11:55 Do you use a primer? If you get a good primer it might help with some of the oil. You might just switch up your foundation too. I tried to use wet and wild and it just got cakey on my face after an hour. Maybelline fit me is probably the best I've found so far.

5591 2018-09-18 13:10:08 Government bond prices ended lower today, as oil prices rose after the news that Saudi Arabia is comfortable with Brent above USD 80/barrel mark. Fall in rupee also weighed on the sentiment.

5605 2018-09-18 13:09:05 Morosi etc was self-harm by the ALP. From my memory 1 factor was that the Libs as a whole refused to accept that Whitlam had won + acted accordingly. Then the oil crisis of 73 & the overturning of post War certainty – Pine Gap + NW Cape also significant but not only factor

5659 2018-09-18 13:03:08 Would be good to clarify if this affects oil/gas facilities. As far as I know, no. They have their own power networks.
5660 2018-09-18 13:02:55 @FERC  is responsible for the regulation and transportation of oil by pipeline in interstate commerce. #FERCFacts
5661 2018-09-18 13:02:55 Wrong! #PresidentBush did, 1) lowered #taxes during the #War. 2) telling the #AmericanPeople that #Iraqi oil is going is paying for the #War, 3)didn't include the cost of the #War in the #budget, 4) #WallStreet was bailed out.

5675 2018-09-18 13:01:42 One thing everyone agrees with is the terms “period” & “cycle” & “era”. All of which span slowly over 100s or 1000s of years or more allowing evolution.

5704 2018-09-18 12:58:55 I agree with you. The current law, unfortunately, does not cater it. My late son had epileptic issues and cannabis oil was one of the things I looked at as it had proven worldwide to reduce seizures. Unfortunately the treating professors can't do anything due to the law.

5720 2018-09-18 12:57:30 India imported 771,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Iran in May. 
It's 2,826 km from Iran to India by land
It's 11,356 km from Fort McMurray to India crossing an ocean
Why would India buy oil from Alberta?

5738 2018-09-18 12:54:36 Looking forward, the ratio suggest that we should see some weakness with Oil over the next few months. However, I wouldn’t expect a large decline if the Demand/Supply ratio continues to hover around 1.00 (END)
5739 2018-09-18 12:54:35 You would think so, yes. But this industry lost money even during the years when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel. The escalation of service costs is part of the problem.

5745 2018-09-18 12:53:51 The Cat RP5500 can run 10-15 hrs depending on load. It should be allowed to cool during refueling.
The oil should also be checked at this time. Also, the unit should be stopped for regular scheduled maintenance (20, 50, 100 etc...) based on the service manual.

5784 2018-09-18 12:49:30 VERY disappointed to find out that @grazedotcom use palm oil in a lot of thier products. I certainly will not be buying any more and recommend anyone to stop until they change this when there’s so many other ethical alternatives  #nahthanks

5787 2018-09-18 12:49:12 If that is the case, then why are multi-millions leaving California for non-state income tax states? Also, Texas will soon over take California as the largest state GDP. It just become the 3rd largest producing of oil in the world, surpassing Irag & Iran.
5788 2018-09-18 12:49:06 Oil painting too ?
5789 2018-09-18 12:48:41 Anything north of Dundee is forgotten about. With the oil downturn, I got fed up hearing how badly Dundee was suffering because of it, what about Aberdeen.
5790 2018-09-18 12:48:40 actually googled it..tena lady.
5791 2018-09-18 12:48:39 Seriously though, those people that fry buns and puffpuff for sale drop bulbs of onion into their oil... U know?

5796 2018-09-18 12:47:58 So I learned yesterday that when a company spills fuel oil all over your basement, the fire department uses what looks like kitty litter to soak it all up.

My cellar is now the worlds biggest litter box.

5799 2018-09-18 12:47:37 I mix half sump oil and diesel mate. Water will make it start spitting every where from what I’ve been told. I’ve never had a problem with that mix. Good things 
5800 2018-09-18 12:47:29 I was taught, and it makes sense to me, that if you’ve got your solvent below the oil line all you’re doing is heating the already vapourised solvent further. All that would do is push your solvent front higher up the condenser. Have it at the same level.

5803 2018-09-18 12:46:59 @narendramodi why government is not reducing excise duty on oil?? Do BJP unable to understand pulse of nation? For revenue loss!!  use black money seized during demonitisation.. #stophurtingcommonMan

5816 2018-09-18 12:45:36 Dietary fat wreaks havoc on your heart and your memory.

FALSE: Not all dietary fat wreaks havoc on your heart and memory. Saturated fat (in butter and red meat) can harm both memory and artery health while monosaturated fats (in olive oil and fish) actually improve both memory

Thanks to everyone at Outerwears for the great products they provided.

5839 2018-09-18 12:43:31 He has worked with both sides, supported gas & oil while supporting safety with fraking. He doesn't yell, he listens. What a change That would be. An educated, smart, businessman, also understands SICENCE! Wow. Go for it.
5840 2018-09-18 12:43:28 The news kinda contradicts the "claim" didn't the Shell safety reps picked this up long before the unions did?

If other oil companies follow suit great but realistically the unions have had very little input into it which is really disappointing.
5841 2018-09-18 12:43:17 U.S. stock exchange futures were higher on Tuesday, helped by a rise in oil prices and concessions that analysts said made the latest round of trade tariffs on China less damaging than initially feared.

5843 2018-09-18 12:43:05 also if you have random drug tests through school or work don’t use CBD oil. it contains a percentage of THC & people are failing drug tests because of it

5894 2018-09-18 12:36:07 Thank you Tania, very kind. I like oils because of the richness of the colour and the buttery textures, no colour shift, some people find the drying times a drawback. Also I'm very into art history so I've studied a lot of oil paintings in galleries.

6091 2018-09-18 12:11:47 Yeah, it was 1/1. It was always a struggle, but I was very committed and wouldn't give up. Oddly, I can trade a 1/1 RR on oil just fine. It was much harder with #es_f for a lot of reasons. I have a natural scalping mentality, so overall it's hard for me to get away from it.

6351 2018-09-18 11:38:40 That will then now also include oil, gas electricity and water, for 55 million UK citizens , Scotland’s 5 million  will produce a vast surplus, to be sold on. WM knows it cannot live without Scotland’s resources.
6352 2018-09-18 11:38:18 As always with conservation it’s so complicated! I’m interested in what the cost to the average UK consumer is to cut the worst unsustainable palm oil products out their weekly shops. Any info appreciated!

6366 2018-09-18 11:36:27 In view of extreme volatility in crude prices it is not prudent to invest further on oil dependent industry. Govt should immediately postpone BS6 introduction & focus on gas / electric vehicles. Keep SC on the loop @narendramodi @PMOIndia @dpradhanbjp @nitin_gadkari
6367 2018-09-18 11:36:24 Why you interlinked between gas and oil. Surely you are confussing people with your lie.

6369 2018-09-18 11:35:55 Many reasons:  Insurance fraud, military industrial complex, employment, destruction of potentially harmful information, theft of oil, gold and poppy fields, foothold in the middle-east to assist Israel, paying back the central bank.  All this information is available to you.
6370 2018-09-18 11:35:49 Would there even be a market for fracking without oil subsidies?
6371 2018-09-18 11:35:37 Being oil producing nation doesn’t mean we refine on a large scale for public consumption..........
6372 2018-09-18 11:35:29 Saudi Arabia has stated that they are comfortable with oil prices rising to $80.00 a barrel. This will happen because of the loss of Iranian oil due to trump's embargo of Iran. This will fuel inflation and cause interest rates to rise.

6627 2018-09-18 10:55:56 とうみょ～ん！
6628 2018-09-18 10:55:54 It is about oil and currencies.

- EU needs energy.
- Iran pipeline via Syria to EU. Syria OK with this. Sell in €Euro.
- But Saudi/Qatar/UAE want to supply energy. Sell in $USD.
- US doesn't want competition against USD. 
- Russia wants competition against USD.

6629 2018-09-18 10:55:46 You could always report on the bayou bridge pipeline protest...you gave me your word you would keep water protectors in the news. Regardless of the media blackouts,and yet you have played along with the oil corps, and tried to keep it out the news.Stand with the people Anderson.
6630 2018-09-18 10:55:15 The Goldsheet is a complete waste of money.  A monkey can pick 50% against the spread. These clowns (dumbest men in a room) batted 33% on their TOP KEY RELEASE plays.

6634 2018-09-18 10:55:05 My body reacting with hives to coconut oil has got to be the most overally dramatic thing I have ever experienced.
6635 2018-09-18 10:54:48 That’s not really needed though considering £45billion in revenue is plenty 

The fact you have been trained to think we are too poor is the very real reason Westminster has already extracted £1.3 trillion in Oil revenue and spent it on England since the 70s
6636 2018-09-18 10:54:21 Alcohol is much worse. Dagga has many great medicinal uses. Especially when it comes to cancer. Whereas alcohol is carcinogenic. Apart from the high, it's actually really good for you. You don't have to smoke it, the oil is fine.

6641 2018-09-18 10:53:24 My car is 9,000 miles overdue for an oil change and I can't deal  with my mechanic yelling at me so I guess I just drive it til it dies
6642 2018-09-18 10:52:56 RBI has sold enough $$ but this fall is much severe. Rbi can't kp selling as it affects foreign reserves. NRI bonds sd hv bn announced by now, things may get even worst fr here as oil expected to touch 82$ in few days.

6649 2018-09-18 10:52:22 Scot Gov was given £28.9billion back of allthat revenue so the free prescriptions come out of all that revenue.

PS even IF Oil only lasted another 40yrs an independent Scotland could accumulate or bank over 240yrs worth of revenue needed to run a highly progressive economy

6657 2018-09-18 10:51:11 very difficult to predict. I am bad at predicting.... I think anywhere near 11k is a good point to turn.... if some global / oil issue crops up then 10400
6658 2018-09-18 10:50:59 ... Remember Chavez gave PRC long term deal on oil at way below market price five to ten years ago ... AGAIN - watch the money !  This was back in the days of PDVSA, CITGO purchase and Joe Kennedy's oil charity.

6666 2018-09-18 10:50:06 Sadly in this you are also highly mistaken. 
Revenue tax collected last year £45billion given to the British exchequer. 
£469billion also given in oil revenue 
£5billion of Scottish produce revenue marked by HMRC as other regions exported directly from oil rig.

6675 2018-09-18 10:48:57 so : cake mix actually can expire . and i used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil and it tastes like ass
6676 2018-09-18 10:48:56 But oil was at 140 during UPA, nothing much happened now looks like some time pass by punters
6677 2018-09-18 10:48:43 Found that oil cleansers are best (I've been doing that for years), and chemical exfoliants are best. Mechanical exfoliants damage the extra cellular matrix, too harsh. And I found there r some compounds that might actually repair wrinkles, like resveratrol. 2/2
6678 2018-09-18 10:48:20 We know, what Israel wants. France obviously believes, that Syria's oil rather belongs to French oil companies than to Syrians.

6682 2018-09-18 10:47:13 So it's either so limited that even specialists & doctors don't know about it, or there are so many technicalities that it's tantamount to being fully illegal. Will check out the companies with licences. Is it not just CBD oil (hemp oil) and non-THC products that are legal?
6683 2018-09-18 10:47:04 I've found to avoid retinol, vit C, essential oils, citrus of any kind, witch hazel, rose flower or oil and hyaluronic acid. Much of this is in our skincare. Which is decided by marketers, not science. 1/2
6684 2018-09-18 10:46:31 It say's it runs in hydrogen bec if you split deuterium, that's hydrogen. That's the source of energy in the future, next to oil, when it rans out.

And it may happen, or prices may fall on less demand from EM countries and slack in US/EU.

6762 2018-09-18 10:32:34 Nothing else happened? So the projects inaugurated by Modiji were financed by US. Manmohan singh runned the show when there was economic crisis in whole world & crude oil was too costly. 21 states are ruled by bjp & is common man stoping them in reducing taxes?illogical arguement

6770 2018-09-18 10:31:10 Sure, try telling that to some governments, like those who want to trade gorillas #Virunga for oil...maybe even present US government.

Brilliant idea though. Wildlife can't get a break from all the evil around them.
6771 2018-09-18 10:31:04 Thanks for this response madam. We have a center that is helping with equipping local contractors to be compliant and able to take on such tasks. We have started with the oil and gas sector. Our goal is to see this extended to other crucial sectors like your ASAP. We can help
6772 2018-09-18 10:30:29 So the one more tanker that isn’t even in the water yet is is the reason the whales are dying? That’s a ridiculous statement, how do you know it’s not a bacteria caused by coal or tree oil from BC? Or that it might be due to over fishing....gets some facts bitch

6787 2018-09-18 10:28:00 Why doesn't Iran use this  fact to pressure Turkey to leave Syria? "Turkey buys about half its crude oil imports from Iran and has said it will not abide by the new sanctions [from the US]."
6788 2018-09-18 10:27:13 No. Only cannabis oil
6789 2018-09-18 10:27:13 However, if I was Putin, Israel would suffer over this. There'd be no Israeli armour and nobody left alive on the Golan heights for a start. I'd bomb it to dust, and then see how much oil they could steal from Syrian land. I'd give them one minute warning of course.
6790 2018-09-18 10:27:10 What about the coal and tree tankers that BC is putting in the water to send to China or the oil tankers leaving the US with refined Oil.

6797 2018-09-18 10:26:05 I don't see you guys blocking trains carrying oil coast to coast, yet this pipeline is a big deal.  It's much safer to pipeline it than to transport the oil by rail.

6800 2018-09-18 10:25:40 Take it from one who has had to put up with headaches every working day. ( Too much stress and hassle, too long on the computer). Don't pop pills. Stick to Amrutanjan/ Tiger balm/ Eucalyptus oil.
6801 2018-09-18 10:24:16 These are estimates ,Coconut oil R19,castor oil R18, tree oil R25, concentrated aloe Vera 1L R49 with water!!! All of these if your really low on money but that hair needs the good nourishment

6803 2018-09-18 10:24:09 This also covers locking babies in cages until they die, murdering innocent victims w/bombs over oil, robbing people of their healthcare so they cannot get what they need to stay alive and a whole host of abhorrent behavior that doesn't seem to bother fake Christians or the GOP
6804 2018-09-18 10:23:56 thanks Dan, appreciate the nod, however, I don't take oil or gas plays, just one of my own rules , good luck with it 
6805 2018-09-18 10:23:50 @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley @FinMinIndia @PetroleumMin @BJP4India I think the major reason for travailing rupee is the import of oil in India.We consume 3735000barrel/day diesel and each barrel costs ~$80 that becomes $29,88,00,000/day.
6806 2018-09-18 10:23:18 who said that he asked to vote him on the basis of reduction in oil prices, and by the way we deal contracts of oil in dollars amount so how it is possible to reduce price where dollar is at 125 Rs.?

6812 2018-09-18 10:22:22 This is an argument of a first year economics student. It is similar to one I heard this morning #AMLiveNTV where Jakoyo Midiwo was comparing Kenya to Ghana.The latter has Gold,Oil & Gas, with bank int. rate @ 25%. Kenya’s economy is supported by incomes from above the surface.

A good tip is to place a tin in the oven with hot water, steam helps rise.

7030 2018-09-18 09:45:17 I’d argue it’s equally at risk from mis-use. Perhaps people will develop a fresh appreciation for what it means if they understand the mechanics behind it before they start throwing around terms they don’t understand. The snake oil is what’s making it so... slippery!
7031 2018-09-18 09:45:12 If we were remotely close to recession oil would not be trending up.

7142 2018-09-18 09:32:57 Those projections are out the window at this point. But one thing to keep in mind is that high price of oil can offset drop in export volume. Plus tax revenue will fall as well as economy slows. So hard to say how proportions will change.

7168 2018-09-18 09:30:16 BTW, Haven't heard much about the price of gas on his show lately (although I can't hear the whole thing). Price is about $3 now. It's not all corporate greed. Crude oil is flowing fine. We're all enjoying the Trump economy and demanding gas for our new cars.
7169 2018-09-18 09:30:10 Interesting. I’m assuming the annual high rise in oil and tax revenues will change starting Nov.?
Do you have an updated version of these projections?

7175 2018-09-18 09:29:27 Don’t get bothered with that. U.S. coalition destroyed Middle-East for #OIL . Now it’s time to KICK them and their ALLIES out of the region.

If someone has problem with it, as Turks, we would like to see their armies around.
7176 2018-09-18 09:29:20 Sir I'm sure you are aware that there was enough debt that needed to be repaid through the oil bonds which was raised during UPA, the high price cannot be looked at in isolation (fuel price vs consumer). This is not something which happened today it's a result of the past actions
7177 2018-09-18 09:29:10 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.

7182 2018-09-18 09:28:43 @PMOIndia : Govts should not get profits over Petrol prices hike by Oil companies. Esp State Govts charging as percentage of price is not correct. They must continue their earlier duty amount as a slab not as a percentage.

Mais ce n'est pas moi qui aie écrit "2015 pourrait se révéler être l’année du pic pétrolier et 2016 l’année du début du déclin" ou, pire (pour moi), "le climat est en train de devenir le cache-misère du ‘peak oil" (2010)

But TOR is being run by CORRUPT political appointees

In that way, private OIL IMPORTERS with political connections can KILL GHANAIANS with official blessing

7442 2018-09-18 08:48:20 Everyone is all about "let's go vegan to save the animals" how many products do you use that contain palm oil?  what about all the animals that are being burnt, killed and forced out of their homes due to deforestation? Doesn't have to say "not tested on animals"...

Telling ppl that only oil bonds was the subsidy bill is misleading...and it seems deliberate.
Big part of debt is in govt borrowing, not oil bonds.

7482 2018-09-18 08:40:41 Deregulate petrol pricing but regulate transport fares? Where are our functioning refineries?  Why didn't we nationalize our oil? Who are the key players of the oil industry?

#AST is priced due to expected permit approvals rather than current cash generation, although I still think it's overpriced where it is.

It isn't normal for an oil company to have mcap/revenue of 15.

Nothing important would be decided in Scotland, we'd be told that our fish & oil and other resources belonged to the EU. The NHS would be destroyed by health tourism and  we'd lose jury trials.
7714 2018-09-18 08:06:46 Having beard and moustache is a great thing but to maintain these we need care products for them as well, so here is beard oil from @GodrejCinthol which is quite good

7731 2018-09-18 08:03:16 Last night the best team ever, tired and happy, for the organization of an amazing wine/oil/cooking session for our new 78 friends from Romania !
7732 2018-09-18 08:03:11 It is It is . Siphon tax payers  money do a Nirav Modi or a Mallya , buy an island and create your own little paradise . Or wait , no need to do a Nirav Modi or Mallya . Join a ministry - I heard currently finance & Oil are doing well .
7733 2018-09-18 08:03:08 No that was a conservative view for me to begin with...anyways...a success for me with my buy in price.
This Heid girl is learning. 
7734 2018-09-18 08:02:54 Should moisturise and exfoliate on the hard skin.
7735 2018-09-18 08:02:51 Your oven’s set too low and you only need a dash of oil.
7736 2018-09-18 08:02:28 You could have just changed the station na... or mute it.

7738 2018-09-18 08:02:26 Cannabis oil is very healthy, it's the supplement they're in the process of legalizing cos it kills cancer cells and eases epilepsy. There's no hallucinogen in it.
7739 2018-09-18 08:02:23 I've noticed that everything in my handbag seems to smell of CBD oil at the moment 
7740 2018-09-18 08:02:18 This is near me.....luckily we dodged most of the damage here......you are up late burning the midnight oil Bob! Get some sleep! #pompinainteasy

7745 2018-09-18 08:01:43 Delays create uncertaintity which nobody likes but they have a very good asset there, even more so at today oil prices. I suspect a deal is highly probable be it with with current JV or some other co. In the meantime they are advancing the project.
7746 2018-09-18 08:01:33 So is BJP competing ??? are you dumb or something?? Crude oil rates were so highwhat’s the reason for BJP to increase when crude oil rates are low
7747 2018-09-18 08:01:30 @benkoku Nigeria oil market to a large    extent is regulated. Some of the cost is absorbed by their government .This keeps prices relatively stable.
7748 2018-09-18 08:01:26 They have had this technology since the late 70s. No surprise for the oil companies , they bought it out and then sat on it

7 days transport to site.
7 days to set up.

73 days untill end of drilling season in Mongolia.

Plenty of time left to drill Wild Horse  490million barrels of oil.

7755 2018-09-18 08:00:36 He has clarified that the oil/gas we are purchasing from outside and inside country in dollars. So due to dollar increase around 20 rupees. The prices are increasing
7756 2018-09-18 08:00:32 when you’ve countries like Togo, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone buying fuel cheaper at the pump than you a Ghanaian who produces oil. Then you know your leaders don’t care about you. Fuel cost in Nigeria is 60% cheaper than in Ghana #CitiCBS @benkoku

I am sure others can add to the list?

7981 2018-09-18 07:17:54 I have found that Oregano oil works well to keep midges at bay - they don't seem to like it too much.  Dilute just a drop or two into carrier oil or Aloe Vera Gel and test a small amount first, as it can sting a little. Also good for easy itchy bites, I have found.
7982 2018-09-18 07:17:50 In Nigeria, if you've not served and you get an offer from any oil company, especially NAOC, you will be deprived the appointment. You will leave, go serve and when you return, nothing again (my experience). We have a terrible law in Nigeria but until it is changed, we obey it!
7983 2018-09-18 07:17:16 The cost of living is around 3+ times Scotlands, the sovereign wealth fund is around 80% leveraged. UK uses oil and gas (and imports) whilst Norway, sells almost all of their product, there's a big difference in economics

8053 2018-09-18 07:06:00 Where do you think these increased shipments of oil are going? Do you see any oil tankers heading out from Westridge? Did we build a new refinery? Not much other uses for bitumen here. Perhaps you’re referring to trains to the US from Alberta? Not oil by rail in B.C.

8085 2018-09-18 06:58:00 It’s odd bc commitment to strategy is the one advantage Russia should have vs West. Yet it seems, perhaps due to sanctions, that Russia has caught the oil (gas) money addition. Geopolitical interests vary based on who is courting Gazprom. Right now it’s Korea.

Same happened to Fidel Castro who supported ANC. So Cuba paid a big price too.

In absence of enough $ how are we going to afford oil imports.

Is it smart explanation?

8522 2018-09-18 05:29:45 This bitch sold Alaska out to the oil and mining industies for some $ supposedly for her constituents and now we'll have a major environmental disaster in the future because she craves the mighty dollar and the power that comes with it. Sad so sad.

8525 2018-09-18 05:29:16 I like to put crispy hydro flask chilled water in my oil diffuser. Only the best for my baby.
8526 2018-09-18 05:29:10 The Early Oil Program was a ruse! It'll be awhile before we hit commercial volumes to be deemed an oil producing nation. In the meanwhile, let's focus on sorting out this price increase mess
8527 2018-09-18 05:29:09 But the companies using the dirty palm oil are not being sustainable and it is having a huge effect on the orangutan population. There are alternatives to palm oil existing and there are clean ways of producing it - im only calling out the companies who are failing to do so.

8530 2018-09-18 05:28:18 So what the Oil need to succeed; Goalie perform to average; powerplay to average; penalty kill to average; 5x5 play to dominate with McDavid; McDavid to just be himself. 2 of those things happened last year. But now it's a stretch that this team is playoff bound? Just average?
8531 2018-09-18 05:28:16 John its a bit rich to say they were lies as the prediction was accurate at the time, most oil producers had it similiar. You also forget the White paper is a hefty book and covers many areas in its 600 plus pages. You are not a critique master by just saying that about it.

8534 2018-09-18 05:27:57 Petronas is the national oil company. Petron is a public-listed oil & gas company that is majority-owned by Filipino parties. Don't u know the difference? Btw, did u object when ExxonMobil pulled out of M'sia & Petron bought their local operations?
8535 2018-09-18 05:27:28 Ben Shaprio is going to write a great zinger piece about how poverty still exists. In fact he is just going to rewrite that article he meant to publish change out the words Trump, Golf, and Maria to Maduro, Steaks, and oil devaluation. Not a hit piece against Dem-Socialism.
8536 2018-09-18 05:27:19 Hindus - Please DO NOT PUT MONEY in Hundi or spend it at the Temple.  Take ONLY flowers/Camphor/Oil for lamp etc.  Buy them outside, some small shop keeper benefits and runs a family.  Do not even buy from shops very near the temple, they are another mafia.

8543 2018-09-18 05:25:06 John its just typical of certain people who want to rewrite history, 1. Pre 2014 oil price high., 2. UK who squander Scotlands resources had the price prediction higher. 3. The price is recovering $80 4. Other countries, Norway have made billions since 2014 the UK, squandered it

8664 2018-09-18 05:03:52 @realDonaldTrump 
Dear Mr. President:
  Speaking from experience; one of tbe BEST things that you can do to help the American People is to REQUIRE the oil companies to lower our gas prices. A DIRECT effect on our wallets. The OIL belongs to US!
8665 2018-09-18 05:03:40 They funded the town and helped it expand. So the people loved big oil. So when anyone dared to imply that they might be harming the area, they were attacked, shunned, etc. But this is evidence of companies and private businesses making these decisions. So what?
8666 2018-09-18 05:03:33 I had an 1997 A4 years ago. Had to replace the oil pump, the  abs went out, multiple ongoing boost leaks on the 1.8T, and the final kicker was my rear main seal and transmission fluid pump blew at the same time.

8668 2018-09-18 05:02:59 Really? Wow. The stuff that stay at home mummies find out on social media. Big hit for taxpayers paying the bills of unemployed oil workers and their fire.
8669 2018-09-18 05:02:57 @realDonaldTrump 
Noone should make more than countries, period!! We need the government that called out Standard Oil! To call out WallMart, should be a reasonable limit to how much a single family or person can gross!
8670 2018-09-18 05:02:49 Wish it had been oil and not oli. Anyways both are slippery. Hence caution suggested.
8671 2018-09-18 05:02:41 We must have a transfer of skills program to our contractors locally to create a multiplier effect for our own economy and products like steel , cement and with the Oil production we can have our own bitumen.That will reduce our import bill.Lets look to empower our own !
8672 2018-09-18 05:02:39 i love castor oil
8673 2018-09-18 05:02:21 That's because the crude oil was a freaking 145 dollars. Now it's half and yet prices are higher
8674 2018-09-18 05:02:10 While USA strapped by oil lobby rest of world looking much further into future & advancing clean energy. We will end up buying tech from everyone else if we continue to bow to short sited greed instead of building road to future. We are losing precious time & resources.
8675 2018-09-18 05:02:03 Did you know a woman was shunned by a whole community for asking questions? It was a midwife asking about the increase in still births since the oil companies had moved into the area. She was shunned because big oil had courted them well. /
8676 2018-09-18 05:01:50 Few understand that to break this Reverse Funnel Design & to achieve ₹60/$ mark, sucking out ₹ liquidity from market by taxing imported oil is Key !
8677 2018-09-18 05:01:39 You do know the Fort Mac fire was set for a reason right? The price of oil tanked too $28 WTI And Dilbit was selling for 20% less as Canadian Select! All big projects shut down and people were leaving keys in the mailbox. Check out Suncor profits for that year

8690 2018-09-18 04:58:22 They haven't increased gas prices due to pricing link with oil. The reason they have given is SSGC and sngpl have heavy line losses and they want to fund their active projects.

8694 2018-09-18 04:57:39 If so they are doing a terrible job of stopping the energy industry. 
Oil production is the highest in history, an oil sands mine the size of Cleveland just opened last week, a new refinery just came on line and another just secured $8.5B in funding.

8715 2018-09-18 04:53:57 According to Awuah Darko of BOST fame, oil companies paid security fees which were subsequently paid into Julius Debrah's account at the Central Bank.

Question: Which security fees were they paying for?

I am happy the Special Prosecutor has been petitioned about this matter.
8716 2018-09-18 04:53:34 it would honestly depend on the type of tortilla and like if you're using oil for it to fry a little or just heating it long enough for it to crisp up

8786 2018-09-18 04:45:06 Honestly, I don't think it matters as long as the oil goes in before heating, and you have enough liquid on the popped kernel to cause the salt to stick. Alton's way is simpler. I like chulula and butter on my fancy popcorn tho.

8791 2018-09-18 04:43:43 Keep investing in cross border terrorism mobilizing funds from imposing  jaziya on your own people, when we in India have difficulty managing our economy in trade war and importing crude oil, rupee devaluation, How pakistan will survive
8792 2018-09-18 04:43:37 I have been hearing how people who work at the Liquor stores can’t get access the borders anymore. Anyone connected with marijuana. I wonder how true this all is. It sounds odd that if you have a prescription for CBD oil or marijuana that you are not allowed into the U.S.
8793 2018-09-18 04:43:34 And its time we stop kowtowing to big oil, end their subsidies and stop them from bleeding our resources dry and leaving Canada to clean up their fucking mess.

8796 2018-09-18 04:42:19 Oil markets fell on Tuesday as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war clouded the outlook for crude demand from the two countries, which are the world's top two oil consumers.

8801 2018-09-18 04:41:56 Oh man that is an intense amount of oil
8802 2018-09-18 04:41:48 @PMOIndia @dpradhanbjp @EPDFIndia @arunjaitley In order to reduce the impact of price fluctuations in oil prices, we should impose taxes at  fixed amount rather than a percentage. There will be no fear of affecting our revenue collection.
8803 2018-09-18 04:41:41 Centre must solve the rupee depreciation first. Oil price will stabilise automatically

8809 2018-09-18 04:40:56 "Overinvested in oil"?  That doesn't even make any sense.

8825 2018-09-18 04:39:09 They lost several aircraft's and helicopter before and they are still there ... 

US +allies wasted few 100 billions on a half empty desert . At least some oil is there
8826 2018-09-18 04:39:08 I ran out of oil lol I got Vaseline though
8827 2018-09-18 04:38:48 面白いし、上手い小説書く人が「伸びない、俺ダメなのかな」と言っているところに出くわすことが多く、見ていて苦しいです……
8828 2018-09-18 04:38:45 That sounds great actually. I am a huge fan of reduced balsamic as an ice cream topping. Also...a REALLY good aged olive oil is just heaven on ice cream in tiny tiny amounts.
8829 2018-09-18 04:38:40 That has been the story of The Republican Party since Regan. Notice all republican administrations end in scandal and economic issues. Giving all of the money to the rich will do that. Military industrialists and Oil barons do well. 
The rest of us not.
8830 2018-09-18 04:38:13 I’m running outta coconut oil
8831 2018-09-18 04:37:58 We live in a right now culture. That's outdated and does little to grow a tour's exposure.

Imagine if the World of Outlaws or Lucas Oil had that mindset. I'm grateful they don't.
8832 2018-09-18 04:37:48 This month I’ve developed dark spots on my face and it’s so ugly. Sephora gave me some oil to hopefully help with it and I just pray that it works 
8833 2018-09-18 04:37:40 Wonder if the scent of coconut oil will clash...
8834 2018-09-18 04:37:40 probably, but whatever she thought of- apply oil to slip, put towels to increase weight etc etc werent thought of by Aishwariya or Yashika... to me, that is Viji's own idea
8835 2018-09-18 04:37:33 The rally is held days before the 46th anniversary of the dark days of  Martial Law under  the ousted Marcos government and as oil prices  increase anew today for  its sixth consecutive week.

8848 2018-09-18 04:35:21 Proverbs 21:17 He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
8849 2018-09-18 04:34:50 That's because you're a conspiracy nutjob.

For you, nobody can simply be a good person.

It's all a dark and evil conspiracy, awaiting someone to come along and sate your self-fulfilling prophecy.

Still buying snake oil too?
8850 2018-09-18 04:34:48 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or you and your family.
8851 2018-09-18 04:34:41 Cruz is selling snake oil to Texans - he should brace himself for the backlash and turn-tail

8857 2018-09-18 04:32:40 Just spent 2 hours talking to my mom about life & CBD oil. 
8858 2018-09-18 04:32:29 •rinse your hair with cold water at the end of each shower. this prevents moisture loss and heat damage
•apply oil or mask treatments weekly. depending whether you have oily, dry or damaged hair it can surely prevent any more issues to occur, making the hair clean

8912 2018-09-18 04:21:57 Even if they gave loan it lot of it went to small people. Now because of bankrupcy law small industries do not want to take loan and do some work. They are very afraid their house will be japta. That is why our economy is going down. When oil price was low why no savings?
8913 2018-09-18 04:21:57 Everybody knows petrol price goes up when crude oil price increases. thats when UPA ruled - crude oil price was 110 US dollars/barrels. Now its 70 US dollars/barrels. Why Modi govt is not reducing the price?

8945 2018-09-18 04:16:47 Don't be a fool. The sanctions are NOT against the people, they are against the crookes that wasted and stole a trillion dollars in 10 years when oil was around $100. How can the richest country become the poorest in a few years without war???

8961 2018-09-18 04:14:48 Honestly I second this, the first time I got high I realized what it was like to actually be able to eat food. Also look into cbd oil!! It’s completely legal and has many of the medical benefits of marijuana without the psychoactive properties!

8964 2018-09-18 04:14:21 just saw a fb video where they "uncovered the shocking truths of the food industry":

-soda has food coloring
-margarine is made of oil
-store bought honey isn't pure honey

if any of that was shocking just pls pls pls educate yourself about what you're putting in your body
8965 2018-09-18 04:14:19 He is right. Moving oil by rail is too dangerous. Time for @MarcGarneau and @cathmckenna to better regulate or ban it.
8966 2018-09-18 04:14:10 I currently use it for anxiety. I use @NaturesUltra CBD oil. I’ve been using for 6 months and noticed my anxiety go down a ton after 2 weeks of daily use. I believe it’s worth it.
8967 2018-09-18 04:13:57 The article completely ignores the pro-labour argument that the provincial NDP bases their support for pipelines and the oil industry. It also ignores the serious rift with the federal NDP over this issue. It further ignores the sincere efforts made to support the oil industry.

8970 2018-09-18 04:13:40 You chop, I chop, is corruption. Everybody choping where they didn't sow. This is self indictment on your part, by encouraging graft, rent seeking behaviour u deliberately destroyed socio-moral, economic fabric of our society.

8978 2018-09-18 04:12:59 We all, including all the political parties, have willingly brought this curse upon ourselves hankering for utopia and sold our souls to snake oil vendors!!  I wish wisdom dawns upon all of us, political parties included, before the Nation becomes history!!

8980 2018-09-18 04:12:46 I had an 84 Volvo that ran and looked nearly new with 380,000 k on the odometer because I cared for it and changed the oil. Sold it after 9 years and it was still running strong.
I became adherent to regular oil changes when I saw the damage irregular changes did to my fist car.
8981 2018-09-18 04:12:43 O&G revenue has dropped precipitously due to lower world oil prices (as well as the loss we incur by not being able to export our oil  products). and it might not recover. 

your claim that teachers' compensation and pensions "largely flows" from revenues is a tad exaggerated?

There was literally a story about a woman protesting for women's rights that was going to be beheaded by the Sauds for doing such. Wonder what happened...
8994 2018-09-18 04:10:21 You are indeed correct, China does not give money, although it has opened an aid division that does provide some grants and tech assistance. What it does do, apart from loans, is provide funds against access to a set of assets eg oil, timber concessions, coal mines.

9040 2018-09-18 04:01:33 I’m confused. First the violence was all the Jews’ fault for building houses in their ancestral land and for not being ethnically cleansed from there. Now it’s the UK and US’ fault because of oil. But it’s in no way the fault of the murderer and the society he grew up in.
9041 2018-09-18 04:01:17 Saudi Aramco to spend over $133 bln on drilling over next decade. This combined with them not IPO'ing Aramco implies they are bullish on oil. Ie. spare capacity constraints are perhaps real. Demand, well that they have no control over for now

9057 2018-09-18 03:58:08 Fuel oil is taxed highly to encourage lower usage, in order to reduce pollution. Isn’t that obvious? Progressive government will not make use of electric vehicles more expensive for this reason. If you find electric cars impractical, get a more economical petrol or hybrid car.
9058 2018-09-18 03:58:01 Added frankincense to my nightly essential oil diffuser and look at the PEACE!

9065 2018-09-18 03:56:41 Yeah, right! 17% increases for C level top executives... .003 for middle class!? Plus a huge tax cut that benefited these same people with version 2 being fast tracked as well! Oil prices up significantly, tariffs increases beginning to be felt! Push taxes on the people, right!
9066 2018-09-18 03:56:41 I just need to get this off my chest. The Sunday Riley Luna oil smells like dirty old man feet.

9069 2018-09-18 03:56:25 @DrAMSinghvi @AICCMedia @rssurjewala @INCIndia sir one press conference should be organized in next days about how central government is spreading out false information regarding payment done of oil bond,while budget says only 44 cr rupees have paid..
9070 2018-09-18 03:56:23 I don’t know why people still want to drill for oil in Alaska. With all the fossils in politics we could power the world until the sun explodes. 

(For those who might not get this reference, Bloomberg is already pushing 80... You can legally run for Pres at 35...)
9071 2018-09-18 03:56:19 Rubbing yourself down in coconut oil after a shower is the best feeling

9083 2018-09-18 03:54:23 Been obvious all along - only Scotland has enough of the type of resources need to negotiate with EU - fishing, food and drink exports oil etc etc - they need these resources held captive.

What is it with me 
9086 2018-09-18 03:54:11 I tried to do a peppermint oil steam & I’m pretty sure I burned my upper lip
9087 2018-09-18 03:54:07 The most ridiculous BS article. The NDP are on their bellies before the oil industry. The @RachelNotley got the @liberal_party to buy a pipeline for us. The shareholders were thrilled to offload it to us cuz it's a bad investment. All parties sucking up to @OilGasCanada
9088 2018-09-18 03:53:57 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

9104 2018-09-18 03:51:45 This govt is taking steps to eliminate oil consumption itself. Don't know what u mean by "at least acknowledge the problem"..

Ok I understand lol
9111 2018-09-18 03:51:02 I have a liquor shelf which makes me feel like a really classy guy. 

My olive oil and balsamic vinegar is also on the same shelf because they're too tall for any other shelf. 

I am a classy space-efficient gourmet.

oh, and resource royalties only make up a small percentage of AB govt revenue

9131 2018-09-18 03:48:22 Remember thinking how bad the Oil GM was such a moron for allowing the Nurse hold out to go on so long? And then the other shoe dropped and it turns out the Oilers were in the driver's seat the whole time? And got the exact right deal for the player? Does it hurt you physically?

9137 2018-09-18 03:47:38 See with me, the tea tree oil dries out my sensitive dry ass even more and sometimes leaves me with scars so I tend to shy away from it :/ but I’m def gunna try out the cetaphil in general.
9138 2018-09-18 03:47:21 When I worked at Wingstop someone asked me, "Is there oil in your wings?" With 4 industrial deep fryers with dozens of gallons of oil directly behind me. I couldn't help laughing at that question. Doubt this chick meant any disrespect until you made a mountain out of a molehill.

9180 2018-09-18 03:41:30 So the GOP's strategy on Kavanaugh is basically, "Let us confirm this guy or the next nominee one will be worse..." It mirrors the Trump impeachment warning, "Do you really want Pence?"

9193 2018-09-18 03:40:33 The oil price decline is the reason for the oil sector's difficulties and that decline began in mid-2014, more than a year before the Liberals or NDP came to power. It was self-inflicted, too, as the oil industry delivered the technologies for the American shale revolution.

9209 2018-09-18 03:38:32 All these moves are reminder of the last day desperation of GEJ. He gave out foreign monies, oil block etc. He begged. He sobed. Now I am beginning to believe HSBC report. RIP to free & fair election. Police will beat the hell out of anyone with even Nokia 3310.

9218 2018-09-18 03:37:44 He's remainer May's mouth-piece. He says what she would like to say but as PM cant. Snake-oil-salesmen. Democracy is dying. The democratic will of the people opposed by politicians. The political process via elections has become pointless. Betraying Brexit is to betray democracy.
9219 2018-09-18 03:37:42 Jack is just trying to confuse you.The deep state is the collobration of the bankers, defense contractors, oil corporations, and multinational corporations to seize control over the entire world. Attention must be paid to the big picture and not focused on the FBI, State Dept,etc

9227 2018-09-18 03:36:42 But whaddabout all that oil on head? Things could get explosive.
9228 2018-09-18 03:36:12 Only 5m people live in Norway, but due to the careful management of its oil wealth, the country runs the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. Everything about the fund is big. Very big.  assets,, totaled $890 billion at the end of June that's $178,000 for every Norwegian.
9229 2018-09-18 03:36:11 I don't know how  you can say this frankly. The @albertaNDP are just like the PCs. They are puppets of @OilGasCanada They are using the C tax for oil industry innovations. Orphan well loan. No changes to REDA. Almost half a million a week ads for oil industry boosting.

9234 2018-09-18 03:35:33 You may not like her carbon tax, plan to deal w deficit and certainly never vote for her but she is not the enemy of the industry. Many senior leaders in oil and gas appreciate her work on tmx. I hear it everyday - “I am not NDP- but I appreciate Notley’s work on this.”

9237 2018-09-18 03:35:30 Fake prez, your optics are hollow when you re-enslave American citizenry to Big Oil/Parma/Finance. The old Jim Crow is slowly and appropriately being put down. This includes you, fake prez. America is then free to sustainably flourish for real.

9239 2018-09-18 03:35:17 @seanhannity Fox showed old man Bush run his finger across his throat as Jeb had dropped out last debate. That 28pg reprt would expose the Bush's. Old man N SA doing oil deals & SA hit the TT, not who most of us thought did.

9259 2018-09-18 03:32:33 Honestly I think it’s fine to punish people who buy the single ply toilet paper at the supermarket.

Or buyers of caged eggs.

Or people who buy those vegetable oil spreads when you ask them to buy butter.
9260 2018-09-18 03:32:13 Are u using the fragrance oil or the essential oil?

9270 2018-09-18 03:30:58 Using "people are angry" on oil prices is such a cop out.

9287 2018-09-18 03:28:09 Yes I agree. How is it that gas/oil corps make trillions yearly but can only pay min wage for those selling the product? Oh but you get a whole quarter raise once a year. Wow.....thanks a whole quarter
9288 2018-09-18 03:28:04 POS car we got from pawn place is falling apart. Wouldn't mind it needing real work beyond maintenance, but it's got multiple huge oil leaks + a knocking engine that'll kill the engine permanently soon. Today after work I was stranded by it (and shitty Transpo down here)

9348 2018-09-18 03:19:10 The pipeline ensures that the oil industry in the prairies remains healthy and we’re actually able it get our product to market. A healthy oil industry means more royalties which means more money for the country in general . Why is it okay when Norway does it but not us?
9349 2018-09-18 03:19:06 I still don’t like you.. but I have to agree on this.. as a teacher I opted out of David Suzuki at the conference. I am well aware that the oil sands are a huge benefit us! Just wish you weren’t such an uneducated asshole and bigot in other areas!
9350 2018-09-18 03:19:00 IF YOU ARE GARBAGE IN AN OIL SPILL THEN YOU ARE THE CUTEST OIL SPILL GARBAGE EVER
9351 2018-09-18 03:18:18 The lemongrass body oil from Trader Joe’s is perfect. Makes my hair smell really good.
9352 2018-09-18 03:18:08 I’m sure my scalp thanking me for this oil i put on it 
9353 2018-09-18 03:18:06 @eCateringIRCTC @RailMinIndia Sir, traveling in train 12017 PNR 2446574994. The quality of breakfast given is horrible, omelet provided is smelling of rotten egg and potato cutlet seems to be made yesterday in stale oil!
9354 2018-09-18 03:18:01 The brutal communist dictatorship must be overthrown since they are causing people to die of hunger, in an OPEC oil rich nation, ruined by corrupt communism.
9355 2018-09-18 03:17:36 Wow.....en dan was daar oil panic(witte) en so groen een...greenhouse met daai wurms. En dan so donker bruin een, seker donkey kong 2. Ek weet hierdie oranje donkey kong het op 'n 1000 oorgeslaan soos 1999/2000 millenium
9356 2018-09-18 03:17:03 Sometimes rashes don't appear or are too faint to see clearly.  Can bring out rash markings with essential oils like a few drops of clove and oregano in castor oil topically.

9358 2018-09-18 03:16:46 Fucking with oil now
9359 2018-09-18 03:16:42 Do it!

Malthus assumed no productivity gains in food production.

Technology destroyed the caloric output limits, using oil/gas to make fertiliser and transport it, and transport food.
9360 2018-09-18 03:16:28 I gotta get a new battery  imma know how to change oil in a minute gah damn

9362 2018-09-18 03:16:02 Why didn't it go down when oil prices were depressed? Crude oil fluctuates but fuel prices moves in only single direction.
9363 2018-09-18 03:15:54 いや、可愛いなおい！
9364 2018-09-18 03:15:53 I agree the sun  if we could harness that energy would be great if we can get off the fossil fuels but oil is used for so much more from water bottles medical equipment and probably to make solar panels run industries cars and so much more
9365 2018-09-18 03:15:41 A 1024 GB Note 9...filled with the Library of Congress and USPO(United States patent office) patents...and go back to 1926.

9369 2018-09-18 03:15:14 If you're a beach person, create a beach at home. Lay out towels, pop open an umbrella. Put lunch in a cooler, dress for the sun, put summer bar music on on one player, the sound of waves on another, blow up beach balls, put on coconut oil, make playdo and build crabs, etc. :-)

9373 2018-09-18 03:14:24 Give us one that is high in healthy fats (no canola, no soy, no corn, no vegetable) and I'll consider it.  I suggest coconut oil.  I'm KETO!
9374 2018-09-18 03:14:09 Also vegetable oils - corn oil, canola, soybean etc. this has had a massive negative impact on health and weight.

9382 2018-09-18 03:11:33 @IndianOilcl Congratulations for looting is with all the hikes. Even when the global oil was going down last week and the rupee was recovering you managed to increase the prices. Common man can suffer you just need to make profits!!!. #Unindian

9384 2018-09-18 03:11:09 No, it doesn't. It produces California wasting all of its money holding up all the flyover states while conservatives simultaneously fund farming/oil subsidies complaining about welfare.
9385 2018-09-18 03:11:03 @ndtv 830am head line news, 4 states cut taxes on fuel but u don't say by how much?? Der is no news except every day petrol price hike. Lousy movie tickets, n beer costs way more than petrol. No one ever explains wat goes in background to secure oil, why its only traded in $$
9386 2018-09-18 03:10:51 Neighbor tells me a project he’s working on in Vaca Muerta is doing 230,000 boe/d. Surprised as seems to indicate play doing more than I thought. Anyone know total production now?  50/50 oil-gas split. Subsidized gas ~$4.50 and 21 api low/no sulfur oil.  Arg deferring subsidies.

9394 2018-09-18 03:09:42 CBD oil is super calming - reduces pain and inflammation. But my experiences with it knocked me tf outs not something i could use while working.

9417 2018-09-18 03:07:04 Oil markets dropped as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war clouded the outlook for demand, although concerns over tightening supply offered prices some support.

9437 2018-09-18 03:03:43 Uhhhh so in my experience I’ve had the best results once I started removing my makeup with coconut oil (wipes can cause a build up of fungus) and a soft face wash like Biore. After washing my face toner is a MUST and moisturizer bc I have suuuuper dry skin.
9438 2018-09-18 03:03:41 Trick is to apply liberal doses of neem leaf paste mixed in castor oil. No bees and bats can harm anyone.

9481 2018-09-18 02:57:34 It's a fair question and I have an answer! I did buy a pepper oil before, from a different brand, and it just kinda sucked. (I don't think it was labeled as Sichuan, though.) So it's not like I haven't been looking, but I take your point.

9486 2018-09-18 02:56:25 Are these serious people wanting to run our country again or just wanting to sell snake oil in a blue box.
9487 2018-09-18 02:56:17 You'll find that plenty of people are going to be critical of this right off the bat. Any mineral rights? Can we drill for oil?

It does NOT mean crostini with Parmesan on top.

9519 2018-09-18 02:50:13 I believe Trumps hand in that is in relation with Betsy DeVoss & Sessions $$ investments into the arena of holding children & trafficking. Sessions has the means of moving them via his wife's family shipping lines. My theory re: Trump/Putin involves oil & $$ laundering w/Saudi's.

9523 2018-09-18 02:49:25 “We are committed to abolish by August 2016 the VAT exemption on oil products,” Treasury secretary Henry Rotich said in the letter to the IMF but failed to follow through up until 2018. #ISupportUhuruCuts

9536 2018-09-18 02:47:45 bitch yo titties smell like vegetable oil
9537 2018-09-18 02:47:16 Govt should bring white paper(or any paper) on oil issue .
9538 2018-09-18 02:47:10 It’s not that. They just cant go and invade as they do in the Middle East. They re letting them rot themselves so they can scoop up the oil when possible.
9539 2018-09-18 02:46:59 For example, what would happen to the price of oil if some new technology was discovered that cut the drilling costs by a factor of 10x? 

Or some regulation was passed that made it 10x more expensive?

You're saying it would have *zero* effect?
9540 2018-09-18 02:46:52 Pinterest and I are fighting. It didn’t tell me that the oil was going to jump and give me 3rd degree burns when I flipped the salmon over

9548 2018-09-18 02:45:18 It's a great argument. Do you know the margins for gold mining and drilling for oil? 

Not great. 

They used to be better, but it's more and more competitive.

Sound familiar? 

The demand sets the price, but the cost of getting it out of the ground is *very* relevant.
9549 2018-09-18 02:45:16 Misleading. Avocados may contain more fat but it's the good kind of fat. Nutella in the other hand is mainly palm oil that in large amounts may cause heart problems.
9550 2018-09-18 02:44:52 Has Switzerland ever considered reimbursing the victims of exploitation in Cameroon ? There are billions missing from Limbe's Sonora Oil Co. unaccounted ? Pres Biya spends more time there than his own country . Europeans have a terrible record of rights abuse in Africa .
9551 2018-09-18 02:44:51 Well if your whole job is dedicated to selling snake oil pills and claiming conspiracies, even when none exists, of course you might maybe get lucky every now and then

9557 2018-09-18 02:44:30 I wouldn't buy by brand at all. Also not as mixes or for a particular purpose. Shop around online for 100% pure essential oil and then you can mix it yourself in a carrier oil (almond etc) to a strength that suits you.
9558 2018-09-18 02:44:18 Oil pulling is so convenient yet time consuming

Bet you won't
9571 2018-09-18 02:42:13 Because no other country in the world has the same amount of oil as Venezuela, and our oil is cheaper because is less refined.

9768 2018-09-18 02:10:29 Amazing how they can resist pressure after @JustinTrudeau alienated every other trading partner in small or big ways. He has no options-not even a pipeline to open up oil markets other than the U-S.

9771 2018-09-18 02:10:03 Trip and a tough game and we are bombing the oil.
9772 2018-09-18 02:09:59 A discussion on crude oil export deal can be win-win for both countries. India imports 70% of crude oil demand....this area of business should be explored!!
9773 2018-09-18 02:09:58 I feel like when the Dr. hands the mom the newborn baby, the Dad also gets a booklet with directions for how to work a thermostat, when to change the oil, and how to hang up pictures etc.
9774 2018-09-18 02:09:51 Time for the nuclear solution. 50% dairy duty. No Hormones in milk. USA promises to adopt metric. No guaranteed trade in oil or water.
9775 2018-09-18 02:09:40 Yay!  Cats rule.
9776 2018-09-18 02:09:39 So Putin is forcing Preisdent to push US economy to new highs, invest in military, take major role in Asian politics, become world leader in crude oil exports &sell missiles to Poland? What a moron!!!!
9777 2018-09-18 02:09:26 Yes, they lead to my pocketbook and ability to provide for them as foreign interest groups attack our economy. Carbon tax and oil blockades will do nothing but cripple Canada as the world's worst polluters continue as usual. But at least our elites can buy status in the NWO.
9778 2018-09-18 02:09:14 I thought he'd return as frontman for Midnight Oil.
9779 2018-09-18 02:08:53 And all it takes to trash the oil pan in a corvette is a errant tie down strap off a semi on the interstate

Engine oil change time will vary depending on the type of car and usage situation.
Let's confirm with the vehicle instruction manual.
For normal use exchange at 10,000 - 15,000 km or every year.Turbo engine and diesel engine are exchanged early.

9783 2018-09-18 02:08:29 My friend Kim purchased some oil 2 weeks ago in hopes that it would help her subside some pain that had had her in a wheel chair and not even being able to walk

9784 2018-09-18 02:08:23 On my left ear, 2 out of my 3 lobe piercings have a liquid filled bubble on the back. I put tea tree oil on them, took Tylenol, & sitting with ice on them. Weird.

9791 2018-09-18 02:06:59 But you're always reminded the oil one works right
9792 2018-09-18 02:06:57 Yes, true. Shd you allow rupee to fall like a stone in the river? In 2013 crude sold at $120! It's now $78? Do you see your utter failure, you BJP duffers! It's due to Aurangazeb's cruel Joke on India - excise hikes to nullify falling oil prices. But BoP is gone for a shot! Quit.
9793 2018-09-18 02:06:40 I can’t thank coconut oil enough
9794 2018-09-18 02:06:37 Yes, a pure engineer, so 'autistic'. Most were. You ever been to a party of engineers? lol. Gotta love 'em. And I can code to kill it. Ain't the same  Are similiar, but, sorry, coding isn't making oil happen, it's not making a building happen, or a massive freeway.

9805 2018-09-18 02:04:50 If it’s spicy for real I can’t have it. The acid from the vinaigrette bothered me a little bit. I finally got some legal CBD oil. It helped sleep. I’m hopeful it’ll help my stomach and general pain.
9806 2018-09-18 02:04:47 Try Thieves Oil or Fighting Five in some Throat Coat or a honey ginger tea - have an edible and sleep a lot - hope you feel better
9807 2018-09-18 02:04:36 Uh...the "state" has exclusively owned all resources since they nationalized the oil industry in 1976.
9808 2018-09-18 02:04:28 If you please, don’t repeat that lie. 

Venezuela nationalized their oil resources decades before Chavez & his Bolivarian Revolution.

9814 2018-09-18 02:03:32 My point is the DEA does nothing to help people, like your mom or my dad, suffering from addiction of prescription drugs. They are law enforcement agents. That's what they do. The answer is not the DEA but programs for pain management including expanding CBD oil treatment.

9828 2018-09-18 02:01:17 It’s the irony of using tax income - mainly from oil resources - to pay someone to speak about how evil oil resources are. Would be nice to have an alternative view.

9883 2018-09-18 01:53:10 Yes and no, oil price and production are tied together more intimately than just the exploration, if its not profitable to produce then the companies won't produce.  Cap/ex will go down because future revenues per barrel are not set in stone.  That is just business.

9903 2018-09-18 01:50:16 I agree.

9908 2018-09-18 01:49:44 It’s made from coconut oil. It’s actually a part of coconut oil. The best price I’ve found is Level Up Clean C8 mct on Amazon. Bulletproof makes one but it’s $10 more expensive.
9909 2018-09-18 01:49:41 Not like the place with the LARGEST OIL RESERVES ON EARTH. It’s never the murderous dictator that implements the socialism either. They are waiting in the wings to seize power and take all the cash. Chavez died and left his daughter 4 billion dollars.
9910 2018-09-18 01:49:37 And an oil slick on his head.
9911 2018-09-18 01:49:32 Setting powder then face oil. It’ll come right out

9921 2018-09-18 01:48:11 Pipelines of oil would have been much more acceptable to the public than dilbit. There also would have been many more Canadian jobs. Oil companies just don't want to invest more in the bitumen industry: they want to get as much revenue as possible as quickly as possible.
9922 2018-09-18 01:48:03 Toppings? I put banana peppers pickles and onions w/ lettuce. Salt pepper oil and vinegar

9925 2018-09-18 01:47:37 America is swimming in money from countries like china and saudi!!! dnt see any of saying we dnt want arab oil because women and lgbt communities are opressed, hypocritical nobheds
9926 2018-09-18 01:47:34 Giving subsidy to things in competition with the oil industry isn't so cray when you consider the huge subsidy oil has received for decades, both in unpaid externalities and direct government money. Electric car tax credits are a drop in the bucket by comparison.
9927 2018-09-18 01:47:18 They were convinced a massive flood was coming to wipe out Melbourne & that everyone needed to get to higher ground. They covered themself with baby oil, put on a wet suit, then motorcycle wet weather gear, then an overcoat and a trilby. >

9930 2018-09-18 01:46:45 Who invited the USA to Syria and why is the American position to stay there indefinitely to control Syria’s Oil and economically frustrate them from rebuilding their country that America and her Terrorist Allies Destroyed
9931 2018-09-18 01:46:44 Stop driving; stop using trains, planes, automobiles, buses, lawn mowers, go carts; no more air polluting trucks on the road carrying your food, furniture, electronics; stop use of all ships and boats that don’t exclusively use sails. Then oil companies will go away.
9932 2018-09-18 01:46:22 Hi, what is pure c8 mct oil?
9933 2018-09-18 01:46:05 They are not taking pure cbd , it’s not even a test they have so if it’s positive they need to check who they are going through the oil drops ppl talk about I won’t do I know it’s not pure but I learned what was and who to go through
9934 2018-09-18 01:45:33 Why is anyone beating up on Syria? Why can't everyone mind their own damn business, it's about money, oil and power. They are all despicable
9935 2018-09-18 01:45:33 I ended up using a bit of baby oil, but thanks for the suggestion. :)
9936 2018-09-18 01:45:25 Lacey they won’t put standard oil in my car, only full synthetic homie
9937 2018-09-18 01:45:20 idk if it's the vitamins, the oil i use, the change in diet/lifestyle, or what but my hair is so much softer and has actually grown
9938 2018-09-18 01:45:12 If by air it means no oil then I can maybe fuck with this
9939 2018-09-18 01:45:00 Put me on to this oil control mattifying moisturizer tho
9940 2018-09-18 01:45:00 If life was a car, penis is the funnel for filling the oil. Sure, need oil to run but very little oil
compared to engine, transmission, tires....
9941 2018-09-18 01:44:44 Indegenous production of such gas turbines require technology & a large industrial gas turbine market to absorb the R&D costs. The technology is by and large monopolized by US & Europeans.. market too is cornered around nations with plenty of indegenous production of gas and oil
9942 2018-09-18 01:44:37 Controlled burn at oil refinery in El Segundo.
9943 2018-09-18 01:44:37 I tried the olive oil before but it made my hair feel greasy so I stopped using it. I did meet one hair stylist that had some knowledge on it and said she uses the olive oil. There’s also a scalp “peel” treatment apparently
9944 2018-09-18 01:44:16 Good looks I'ma try it out probably the oil tho
9945 2018-09-18 01:44:10 A2: I had to disable two caches for two years due to the Kalamazoo River oil spill. More of a man-made disaster, but still sucked. #USGeocachingHour
9946 2018-09-18 01:43:52 Attn Teachers, Hard to believe your minority position on Oil & Pipelines. As supposed Intelligent people you certainly have little knowledge of politics in Alberta. Your best Union friends NDP are below UPC by 32 points. Next election NDP are gone & not making any future friends.
9947 2018-09-18 01:43:46 And naff all about how a sovereign wealth investment oil fund works. What do insurance companies do with your cash?
9948 2018-09-18 01:43:38 @HaydnSchneider out of all the CBD products, which do you think works best with inflammation and pain out of the capsules, oil, and lotion?
9949 2018-09-18 01:43:26 @cakebeauty Will you ever bring back your sweet cream dry oil? It's my favorite way to moisturize!

9951 2018-09-18 01:43:06 I hope it is!! Give him a lesson, put on some coconut oil, and talk about black history with the person on the other side of you (if you’re in the middle). Keep us updated, safe flight
9952 2018-09-18 01:42:53 I vaped cbd oil with juice for a while. It got me high af and paranoid and made me eat a lot. Super strong stuff. I finally laid off of it though when the vape pen started acting wonky. Both that and weed make me eat A LOT, mostly sweets/sugary stuff

9954 2018-09-18 01:42:36 You do realize we live in Canada  ehh to heat our homes solar ain’t cutting it whether it’s oil or natural gas we need pipelines although I do agree we must take the environmental concerns seriously

9959 2018-09-18 01:42:17 Eating jasmine rice with olive oil and salt is decadent haha I have no money lmao haha
9960 2018-09-18 01:41:46 Instead of wearing deodorant, i wear coconut oil now, i feel so much better too
9961 2018-09-18 01:41:38 relate, i splashed oil in my facevwhile cooking catfish at work,,,NOT FUN
9962 2018-09-18 01:41:32 ads for face products are so extra like "O-M-G! IN JUST 30 DAYS I ACHIEVED IMMORTALITY WITH THIS KALE CHARCOAL BUTTER OIL MASK!"
9963 2018-09-18 01:41:19 Been there done that. I got my oil changed right after getting off of graveyard
9964 2018-09-18 01:41:16 Caro just gave an oil & gas presentation with the flu, she's my hero :,)
9965 2018-09-18 01:41:02 Win? You made a ridiculous statement that the feds want to control the oil industry. That’s not even close to being plausible
9966 2018-09-18 01:40:52 That hot shower + Shea Butter and Coconut Oil combo at the end of a long day>>>>>>

9971 2018-09-18 01:40:06 See #Moringa Oil Versus #CBD Oil...which is better?
9972 2018-09-18 01:39:55 It's not available to them. Just like pot cigarettes and alcohol weren't available to me when I was a teenager but I was still able to get my hands on them. I want to know where these people are getting all the pot oil to vape. It's hard to find in a state where it's not legal.
9973 2018-09-18 01:39:44 Anything sautéed with butter tastes way better than when it’s done with olive oil
9974 2018-09-18 01:39:30 Still using that shampoo and conditioner combo to this day and it works miracles. I just moisturize with a mix of tea tree oil, black castor oil and olive oil and that's all that touches my scalp since.
9975 2018-09-18 01:39:21 I got a headache after I was searching for car oil at the cheapest price and I bought one.
9976 2018-09-18 01:39:11 Oil changes for my car out the damn roof  s/o to my mom for the coupon
9977 2018-09-18 01:39:07 Oil is cheap due to governments subsidizing #fossilfuels. We pay for oil changes everyday even if we don't change our oil regularly.
9978 2018-09-18 01:38:58 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9979 2018-09-18 01:38:55 Agree completely. But it’s hard to blame the people. Whether for oil, or power, or religion half the world is trying to control Iraq and frankly if they destroy the spirit, goodness and mental health of the people of Iraq in the process they don’t care.
9980 2018-09-18 01:38:48 And by the sounds of it enhanced oil recovery is only the tip of the iceberg for the potential of CCS if only the deniers would take a moment to listen.
9981 2018-09-18 01:38:38 @PMOIndia The best time to do business AGGRESSIVELY In AFRICA is now. Chinese goods glut due to US tariffs will force them to Dump in Africa. MAKE IN INDIA SELL TO AFRICA should be enforced with vigor now. Takeover Mining, Oil n Precious Minerals reserve before Chinese get there

9983 2018-09-18 01:38:29 this motherfucker at my new job was “teaching” me the fryer, and you have to put food into the basket and then the basket into the fryer AND SHE TOLD ME TO “just drop the basket into the fryer and toss the food into the basket”. TOSS THE FOOD INTO THE FRYING OIL IN THE BASKET.
9984 2018-09-18 01:38:27 Shoutout to my dad for getting my oil changed and cleaning out my car today  (he may or may not have found 18 water bottles)
9985 2018-09-18 01:38:15 18 degree heads... Oil shocks... There would be 75 latest in the pits every week

9990 2018-09-18 01:37:02 I dont even know the dallas theme all i know is "blood may be thicker than water. But oil is thicker than both"
9991 2018-09-18 01:36:52 Drenched in butter and extra virgin olive oil. (Period)
9992 2018-09-18 01:36:50 I personally like tea tree oil bc I like how it stimulates my scalp.
9993 2018-09-18 01:36:27 do you think its a good idea to stick my hand in the oil we're gonna use to make funnel cakes
9994 2018-09-18 01:36:13 They sold off the gold reserves, there are now not enough reserves to sustain the currency. Oil is being used in place of Gold to keep the currency stable. Without Scottish Oil, the UK is bankrupt. That's the reason.
9995 2018-09-18 01:35:58 Pure C8 mct oil.
9996 2018-09-18 01:35:55 I love rubbing Shea butter and coconut oil on her smooth skin 
9997 2018-09-18 01:35:54 oh I’m sure it’s much healthier but in essence the keto diet relies on refined foods like oil. which is damaging and inflammatory. almost ever plant food is -80% carbs... keto is a backwards approach to metabolism and the keto narrative is inherently myopic. i can explain further
9998 2018-09-18 01:35:44 Estoy pasadisimo a gas oil 
9999 2018-09-18 01:35:36 i asked joely what made her stop being vegetarian and she said chick-fil-a because “sumn bout that peanut oil”

10001 2018-09-18 01:35:26 This old old head at the bar just hit 3 oil pens at once lmaoo jit dying
10002 2018-09-18 01:35:25 I only know this cause of making my own beard oil but vitamin e oil, castor oil, and argon oil all help promote healthy growth and you can probably make it for fairly cheap
10003 2018-09-18 01:35:05 I feel the same way (I actually don't want us to find oil at this point because I don't think we have the systems in place to control the corruption that tends to follow it).
10004 2018-09-18 01:34:49 กลับอย่างเดียวเนอะ โอเคค่ะ จองไว้ให้แล้วนะ
10005 2018-09-18 01:34:25 Peppermint oil really?! I haven’t tried that. I have some too I’ll give it a shot thank you!

10009 2018-09-18 01:33:28 The smell of garlic cooking in butter or olive oil is an aphrodisiac

10014 2018-09-18 01:32:55 @MayorBowser Shemsu Oil is great for prenatal care. It also helps with postpartum depression & anxiety. We would love to meet with you about the benefits & how we can help with your new campaign on pregnancy in the community. 
10015 2018-09-18 01:32:44 I am sorry but @ChrisCuomo you are beginning to look like a snake oil salesman. You try very hard to prosecute the Kavanaugh accusation and then you use Donald Trump Jr to corroborate your argument.
