55 2018-04-19 20:34:53 I rebuke that rubbish! No one is "exchanged" for cows. It's exactly such bastardisation & commoditization of cultural practices that entrenches the harmful aspects & creates belief systems that demean & belittle women, making them into mere commodities: disposable & abusable.
56 2018-04-19 20:18:55 obviously drug laws don't keep people from getting them, why would gun laws be any different?  all you do is turn those commodities over to an unregulated black market and give more power to criminals

59 2018-04-19 20:10:38 Sentient animals can suffer--same as humans. They experience pain & fear & despair--same as humans. They want to live--same as humans. They are not commodities for our use & amusement. This is the meaning of spiritual aliveness. This is the message we must keep delivering.

64 2018-04-19 20:01:36 Hey @karry_trade , the set up is still valid as CA's employment data was much stronger than AU's and the Central Banks look to be moving in opposite directions. Currently, commodities are weakening the bear case on AUD, but my bull case on CAD remains

68 2018-04-19 19:49:39 Si, subieron los precios de los commodities sobre todo, y todo eso responde al libre mercado, nada que ver con socialismo. Asi que sigo en mi postura. No se si vos sabras de ideologias pero estamos los que algo entendemos, no voy a ponerme a opinar por el resto del Paraguay

76 2018-04-19 19:10:59 True! But Lisa, so far as the surge in commodities is due to geopolitical factors (sanctions/war/trade), prices are likely to normalize (if not then we're in much bigger trouble). Barring this, if commodities are booming, it's usually a sign of growth no?

Trading commodities enables you to participate in broad market moves or within specialized sectors.
245 2018-04-19 09:44:00 Commodities have now emerged as a separate asset class, helping investors to diversify their portfolios.

248 2018-04-19 09:29:10 Em proporções inferiores ao período Dilma, prática de desvincular preço do mercado internacional está viva. Como o turn around começou com Bendine e as commodities saíram do fundo do poço de 2015, relativizo muito o papel do Parente na Petrobrás.

Recent price spikes likely reflect growing concerns over the status of the #Iran nuclear deal. More short-term volatility to come.

258 2018-04-19 08:56:02 Why I'm bullish on #crypto:
1. stablecoins (not proven to work, not proven to not work)
2. decentral. exchanges
3. tokenized securities
4. commodities-backed tokens
5. derivatives (options, leveraged trading)
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 1000

265 2018-04-19 08:27:26 These days commodities are pushed around MORE by exchange trading than by actual demand/supply so a HIGH possibility that it will be at 100 sooner or later.

270 2018-04-19 08:02:49 Hi Wayne,  price gouging in Australia is alive and well courtesy of i) the post GFC mining boom where China paid top $ for commodities to overbuild infrastructure , ii) reckless lending by banks at record low interest rates. For example, ask someone about the cost of electricity
271 2018-04-19 08:02:48 At least everyone paid for there commodities and aren't just loitering about, to where G.U.N has to come in and escort non-paying customers.

310 2018-04-19 05:27:24 I suspect part of the problem is the internal functions of a business are not commodities. The ones that are were greased by capitalism: outsourcing, services, and the like. But synthetic internal versions? Mostly no.

326 2018-04-19 04:20:04 That's on that end and it's factor into the price. What should concern you is what you'd pay to KRA. Between 50-150% of the value of the commodities you're bringing in.

365 2018-04-19 00:32:20 There are criminal organizations coming across the border. This is not unique to Arizona, we have seen any time you have illicit commodities crossing the border, you will have criminals trying to protect those commodities
