Your choices are all gangsters,
42 2018-10-03 23:48:19 Virtually none. There are FEW brokerage houses that will do it. Maybe over on IB, but no smart money shorts a stock at .01 or .02
And very little dumb money ever has enough size to matter (hence the dumb)
Keep on dreamin' though.
43 2018-10-03 23:48:18 Watching the women at the Trump rally. It is so shamefull to see women shouting and waving for this goon! What the hell is wrong with them? They have made themselves laughing stocks. How low in the gutter of stench they are! They have betrayed our gender for a lying pig!
44 2018-10-03 23:48:09 Bingo!  Stocks are still undervalued.  They should be around 2100-2250 a share right now.
45 2018-10-03 23:48:03 But I don't want to just buy stocks. I want to actually invest in someone's business.
46 2018-10-03 23:47:17 I first wrote down my picks at age 20. I started with a reason of unheard of stocks with high volume. Everyone remembers Microsoft or General Motors but who remembers Diasonics or American International Petroleum? So I wrote them down with data. Then I checked 3 mos. later. I won
47 2018-10-03 23:46:44 1. People W/H mental health issues shouldn't be able to have guns.

48 2018-10-03 23:46:30 ((I work at an Amazon warehouse)) For people who work here less than 2 years, like me, there's a clear raise and it's nice. After 2 years, stocks would vest, and without those and monthly bonus, more tenured associates effectively lose $2-5k a year.

51 2018-10-03 23:43:16 His Billions are mainly stocks. If he raises wages and keeps the incentives, the company will have less profits which will lower his net worth but every other share holder will lose as well. Stocks are not only owned by wealthy people, they are invested by pension funds etc.
52 2018-10-03 23:42:40 someone i know got a dollar raise - $2080 a year - but they're losing $3200 in bonuses. they're also losing the two stocks they were to be granted in 2019, and an additional two in 2020. they sold their stocks every year to pay their property taxes. they can't do that now.

71 2018-10-03 23:33:26 Then you guys should stop being lazy losers and victims, take personal responsibility for your lives, work harder, and go buy some stocks so you guys can be rich like me.
72 2018-10-03 23:31:58 A few of us nursing butt wuppins here. Stocks get killed over a refi that otherwise leaves a company in pretty good shape to move forward, in a space where few are as far developed.  
73 2018-10-03 23:31:03 For fast moving guys like commodities / staples retailers, out of stocks can kill you too. Can’t manage inventory too tight. Also have to watch for invetorny purchase agreements on the off BS liabilities note. Hidden inventory sometimes.

89 2018-10-03 23:18:46 Working class doesn't invest in stocks (nor have savings to speak of) because of the need to put food on the table. I'd bet that the overwhelming majority would rather have a living wage rather than stock options -- in this case, no matter how much losing them enriches Bezos.

91 2018-10-03 23:18:06 Bear Steepener

Long-term interest rates rising faster than short-term rates. 

Two textbook reasons for it:

1. Worry about inflation from greater government borrowing; and
2. Increasing pessimism about stocks

Now, see glut of commentary for why "it’s different this time."

95 2018-10-03 23:14:51 @PhillyD it's a trade off. Higher wage vs stock awards & bonuses. In my case it's a loss because I've reached the top of my tier plan (no pay increase for me) & after November 1st @amazon will no longer award me stocks or bonuses.
96 2018-10-03 23:14:35 You say that about five different stocks every month. If you took your own advice, you'd be able to buy several small countries... and you wouldn't need to sell a three page newsletter.

103 2018-10-03 23:08:53 Its a never ending paradox, stocks have a dip, everyone rushes into a blind panic and buys the arse out of bonds. dip buyers emerge in stocks, yields move higher and so on. In the mean time alot of bed shitting gets done

105 2018-10-03 23:08:24 Lowered temporarily. They start going back up next year. And the extra $5 didn't do squat. Corporations on the other hand? Permanent tax cuts. They took that money and bought back their own stocks and lined their pockets. Stop the delusion.
106 2018-10-03 23:06:53 You’ve just painted a target on your back! You aren’t allowed to speak truths here, or talk bad about poor investment choices of “professional researchers”.

117 2018-10-03 22:59:49 You say he is just a lot of hot air. Well hot air is doing a great job. Stocks record high, employment way up ,unemployment way down pay up, trade much better, biggest exporter of oil, NATO doing their share, ISIS all but gone, defending the Constitutin
All this in less than 2yrs
118 2018-10-03 22:58:40 What would you rather hire as a financial advisor? Someone who’s able to choose stocks that’s going to work in your favor $$$$ or someone who can introduce you to warren buffet?
Choices are a bitch.
119 2018-10-03 22:57:38 Once I get a little more familiar with trading stocks and mutual funds. Pure capitalization.
120 2018-10-03 22:56:48 If you run a platform, your sole responsibility should be respecting your users. Your board members are happy when their stocks are worth a lot, and nothing is more valuable than loyal customers.
121 2018-10-03 22:55:34 I think the smartest thing I’m about to do all year is going into stocks
122 2018-10-03 22:54:31 Yup, he's never heard of #Contagion. Without foreign buyers of USTs, higher deficits and new supply combined with max #QT at the same time the ECB and BoJ are tapering their policies does not bode well for US yields or stocks. Credit leads 
123 2018-10-03 22:53:23 Not really. This isn’t a raise. It’s removing the unpredictability of the other parts of the pay package.  So no I dont get the monthly bonus, and only half of that I had any control over, or stocks, again no real control over that. All is all I personally am making 463.8 bucks
124 2018-10-03 22:53:19 That's not HIS money... He's controlling stakeholder, those are good shares, if he "gave" that much money away, cut the jobs in half and stocks would tank. It's not that black and white
125 2018-10-03 22:52:42 great news for those who own stocks, though most Americans DON'T own stocks, in fact many Americans are working 2 jobs and STILL CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET.....so this is just those rich folk getting richer AGAIN
126 2018-10-03 22:52:08 I am more agressive in the fall months as it is the hottest time of the year to trade these kinds of stocks. Don’t beat yourself up
127 2018-10-03 22:51:37 Now Avail 
Limited Stocks Only !
128 2018-10-03 22:51:07 Well, you didn’t listen hard enough because you took back stocks and bonuses. Not giving them anything at all.
129 2018-10-03 22:50:51 I dont tweet a lot but I will say this once. I didnt like the last president but I didnt go bat shit crazy. Im a very middle voter. But yall mf need jesus. GET A GRIP. You have more $ in your account, more in your stocks, more jobs. Oh wait do you have those...? #workhardplayhard
130 2018-10-03 22:50:30 Faye is a catoblepas who trades stocks for fun.
131 2018-10-03 22:49:22 #OMG_TRUMP

But #DemsWant2ReverseAll Why?
I dont care about personality,I care results
132 2018-10-03 22:49:19 Someone teach me how to work stocks
133 2018-10-03 22:49:17 Oh Bernie, he didn’t give them anything. Yes he gave a raise, but he took away stocks and bonuses. Upon hiring, you are given shares, after three yrs, you are given stocks annually. Bonuses a big part of pay.
134 2018-10-03 22:48:04 @VellyVel value stocks present themselves when the Street is running away.
135 2018-10-03 22:47:35 They are hypocrites at their finest -little conviction on their own stocks and have to distract people from their failures by trying to deramp other companies

Prime example #anr

 using homophobic and bigoted remarks as insults to others is so low life
- cretins the lot of them
136 2018-10-03 22:47:18 Lol that you retweeted this, now what stocks should I buy?
137 2018-10-03 22:45:53 Just read the #amazon warehouse deal.
$15 an hour...but you got screwed! Bonuses and stock options gone...hahahahahahaha, stupid!
Might be able to buy stocks next year...hahahaha ←(that's the sound Bezos made when he ok'd the deal.)
138 2018-10-03 22:44:00 Are 30 stocks the entire US economy?

140 2018-10-03 22:41:41 @bulling only for a long term hold for Chinese stocks. But $bidu looks attractive at these levels to buy
141 2018-10-03 22:41:34 ATM with that polecat Trumpy the banks are breaking all the rules and they are getting fat on the free-for-all that’s why the stocks are breaking records.
142 2018-10-03 22:41:21 No one at Amazon is happy about this. Most people are either making the same amount or less than they were. And this comes a month before peak season, when the monthly bonuses double.
I guess Jeff Bezos didn't like his lowly employees also having his precious, precious stocks.
143 2018-10-03 22:41:18 @kabuli I don’t need any stocks to keep gains and don’t care about the company I’m not a long .. there is a thing called day trading stocks
144 2018-10-03 22:41:17 Cut the crap. The average person don’t own stocks. It’s your  cronies who got the big tax breaks keep buying back their own stocks . What about the masses who work for $15 or less. How are they coping? Talk about them . You have made the economy worse by giving big tax breaks
145 2018-10-03 22:41:06 Weed stocks Noyah
146 2018-10-03 22:40:01 Yes they could. They could do a lot of things. Just seems like that article paints the picture that despite a raise in wages workers were going to be getting paid less due to those bonuses and stocks. Not a big Bezos fan but just stating what I read.
147 2018-10-03 22:39:54 Be thankful stocks can only go in two directions.
148 2018-10-03 22:39:47 And now he's taken away stocks and bonuses to pay for it, meaning a small number of high performers will actually be making less.  I knew he wouldn't give up a penny of his $150 billion. Scumbag.
149 2018-10-03 22:39:36 Great financial numbers on Stocks and the people of San Francisco.
150 2018-10-03 22:37:30 And the fact that he’s the president of the most powerful and influential countries on earth....and when the POTUS talks, people listen. As for making his money grow- can you imagine buying Apple, Microsoft or Amazon stocks with your millions in the 1990s?
151 2018-10-03 22:36:22 $HON plans to raise its #dividend by 10% - NICE!! And they raised their guidance several months ago for Q4 of ‘18 - VERY bullish am I on $HON #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investing #InvestmentBanking #investments #WallStreet #Finance #economy
152 2018-10-03 22:34:56 If the week can end positively, that sets us up for a positive Oct. Is it too much money chasing too few stocks?
153 2018-10-03 22:34:53 are you saying that those who thought that stocks will shit the bed when yields hold above 3pc, will shit the bed? 
154 2018-10-03 22:34:51 I wouldn’t buy a 30 year bond.  If you’ve got 30 years.... you can make much more in stocks/ETFs/Mutual Funds etc...
155 2018-10-03 22:34:44 I started a little fund for my 5 nieces and nephews and pop 50 bucks in stocks they like for each birthday and Christmas as well.  They are old enough now they get to pick the stocks.  Mostly fun but good discussions.  Told them we’ll split when last is 21.  Lots of $dis lol
156 2018-10-03 22:32:49 Here is Cali, we capped out at under 15 in 3 years. Now we will cap out at 15.65 in 3 years. But no more stocks or monthly bonus.
157 2018-10-03 22:32:39 bath salts, blow and bump stocks ftw. 2020
158 2018-10-03 22:32:38 NIO need to set a upside record in a stocks too for Investors?
159 2018-10-03 22:31:54 I find out about these stocks too late, and I just know they are a pump & Dump

I like to invest into stocks I believe in
160 2018-10-03 22:31:51 I'm pretty sure neither libs nor republicans support mass shootings. Until you start talking about bump stocks..then u repubs go apesh*t
161 2018-10-03 22:31:45 Pick and choose #BillyBoy, pick and choose. No mention of armor piercing, bump stocks. LaserAim - pick one and only one and hang on to that.
162 2018-10-03 22:31:40 1/2 Financial stocks $XLF are underperforming across the globe, held back by low rates (everywhere), unfinished reforms (Europe) & leverage concerns (China). That makes index weightings to the group an important investment consideration. The S&P 500 is best positioned here,
163 2018-10-03 22:31:28 Do you know what the A shares are P /TBV? I know you have been on top of this one. Do you have the link to the info re: these stocks? TIA!
164 2018-10-03 22:30:57 Econ data continue to be strong. Yet many manufacturing stocks remain depressed. Early warning signs of trouble? Or are investors too gloomy?

Stocks vs 52-wk highs:

DowDuPont $DWDP -16.5
3M $MMM -16.9

IllinoisTool $ITW -19.8
Cunmins $CMI -22.4
165 2018-10-03 22:29:34 My source is from the meeting Amazon management had w/employees yesterday. If your already at $15 or above(our facility was built 10yrs ago so most are long-time employees already making $15-16) $0.25 raise is it for 36 months+incentives & stocks were cut so we lost $3-6k per yr.
166 2018-10-03 22:28:52 True but on the other hand my Tinder stocks would PLUMMET
167 2018-10-03 22:28:02 Keep an eye on these stocks as they ended the day showing good upward momentum with high volume trends on the daily charts:
$PTIE, $HMNY, $INPX, $AMDA, $OHGI, $TRVN, $HSGX, $HUSA, $VNET, $MTNB, $PRTK.

169 2018-10-03 22:26:43 Ironically the only pub nearish Soton who stocks us now and then is in Pompey , although we're in a pub in Reading last week. When i had 5 pubs I tried very hard to get some Southampton real ale after we got promoted. No joy
170 2018-10-03 22:26:06 Look at the Nasdaq look at the fang stocks look st trade with opec and Russia look at the eu looking at spv to get money into Iran take a step back and look at everything that’s going on as I said this isn’t s dig I really yo love your shows but don’t conform
171 2018-10-03 22:25:47 yup
172 2018-10-03 22:25:31 These are the 2 stocks in technology sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:
$HPQ, $ADP
173 2018-10-03 22:24:20 and im pissed cuz i cant flip bump stocks after the federal ban anymore
174 2018-10-03 22:23:47 Did you also know, Bezos took away the financial incentives such as VCP ( monthly bonus) based on productivity and attendance will be eliminated starting November 1? that usually boost our paycheck. Also, employees won't be able to receive more STOCKS.
175 2018-10-03 22:23:44 $TLRY suprised it took so long for the offering. When stock price massively out-weight fundamentals on low cap stocks you have to expect them to raise cash. Growing companies need funds to invest. Also, they would be stupid not too as this massive over-valuation won't last
176 2018-10-03 22:23:26 Not good Stuart! How are ye for grass at the minute? Silage stocks ok?
177 2018-10-03 22:23:17 Once you cap off in your tier plan you will no longer get a raise and that's in 36 months for a new associate. Stocks were granted yearly and bonuses monthly. Short term ok long term you're losing out on a lot of compensation.
178 2018-10-03 22:22:48 Stocks/pillories are still legal in some States;before he hangs,he should spend a week in one or the other,on public display,in all States,where it is legal,to allow citizens to express our thoughts to him;anyone whos he can ACT for a Nation,needs to hear exactly what WE THINK!
179 2018-10-03 22:22:48 I love dividend stocks. If I actually ran my own investment portfolio, I'd probably buy nothing but dividend stocks, so it's probably a good thing I don't run my own investment portfolio.

(Though actually I'm getting a really good return on my dividend stocks.)
180 2018-10-03 22:22:33 All hourly do not get stocks and bonuses. Those get an hourly wage only.
181 2018-10-03 22:22:27 This morning on @BloombergTV 
- US10Y yield hits 7-year high, we speak with Harker and Evans of the Fed
- JPM downgrades Chinese stocks, forecasts 'full-blown trade war'
- Dancing Theresa May survives Tory conference speech (this time)
182 2018-10-03 22:21:56 Some stocks to keep an eye on showing upward momentum on the daily charts: 
$AGRX, $CPHI, $GLOW, $ONCS, $GPOR, $ATSG, $DNOW, $GTN.
183 2018-10-03 22:21:28 Okay, traditional stocks make up a huge chunk of savvy investors' portfolio. Did you know that lots of sophisticated owners have 50% in traditional stocks & 50%  in other alternative investments & real estate is at the top. Heck! Real estate sometimes is at 80%. Yes,indeed!#RFV
184 2018-10-03 22:19:37 We had an all hands meeting yesterday. Top out after 3 years (the only raise now) is $0.65. After taking away stocks/VCP we are losing $1 an hour.
185 2018-10-03 22:19:25 How special of you to give Nate a nickname. Look, it’s intellectually dishonest to say one can’t support the 2nd amendment while being in favor of restrictions and even some bans.  Collins supports regulating or all-out banning bump stocks, doesn’t he? Is he anti-2A for that?
186 2018-10-03 22:19:10 hahahahah expect all pot stocks short sellers account to blow up this winter
187 2018-10-03 22:18:56 Dem stocks boomin 
188 2018-10-03 22:18:31 Yes and no.  Rarely if ever any stocks.
189 2018-10-03 22:18:08 He’s your president for another 6 years OJM. Live with it. Blacks/Hispanics/women lowest employment brother! Stocks highest ever! SCOTUS gonna be packed with conservatives lmfao. Omg OJM your gonna need therapy after these 8 years. #walkaway sir. For your own good.
190 2018-10-03 22:17:46 Do you still supply the squirty cream to Asda as they say they have no record on there system. I sent a picture reply showing your stock on their shelf from a while back. As of yet I’ve had no reply...stocks at home running low....send help!!!
191 2018-10-03 22:17:40 One of my many penny stocks I own made me $26 today
192 2018-10-03 22:17:00 New to stocks ??
193 2018-10-03 22:16:53 Why not get specific about it? 
I see what your referencing and sounds like the vast majority are seeing an instant increase to their pay check. Totally sucks of Amazon to take away stocks after 2 years vesting(that's a long time) and monthly bonuses which seem performance based.

195 2018-10-03 22:16:04 S&P 500 IS A LIE!!!  “The S&P 500 stock market index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, comprises 505 common stocks issued by 500 large-cap companies”
196 2018-10-03 22:15:54 Stocks a bitt on a languish over the #PFS. I agree short term could see support at .45 and .43 retested. Still optimistic though that 0.48 will hopefully hold.
197 2018-10-03 22:15:27 Apparently the cheerleaders over at the financial media have caused a problem.  We are (in what seems like) a correction and I don’t see the extended hours shares of SS’s moving at all.  I’d be dumping stocks with the $zn_f in free fall mode.  But hey I’m positioned for it.
198 2018-10-03 22:14:57 Hi. Were you looking to trade these stocks on your share dealing or leveraged CFD/Spread Bet account? I note that irrespective, you will not be able to trade KBEVF as it is a OTC stock, which we do not offer. KBEV we would need to review depending on your account type. Thanks. CB
199 2018-10-03 22:14:27 Stocks have nothing to with your small hands!
200 2018-10-03 22:13:54 Failing? Since election day their stocks have soared 141% Mexican billionaire Carlos Helu made $422,827,825. On his times investment. Sounds like sombody is just mad he didn't invest.  Often told when? They did their job and got the story out.

Remember all that noise about Junior mining stocks as zombies? Back before cannibus and cryptocraze...
203 2018-10-03 22:12:47 I really want to start investing in stocks
204 2018-10-03 22:12:38 Keep on being bad Mr President. Your awesomeness is good for America. Stocks are at an all time high and your calling evil what it is, evil. These reporters do not care about America, they are CYA. Keep on keeping on. You are awesomeness
205 2018-10-03 22:12:11 bro this is fucking bullshit why’d they make owning bump stocks a criminal offense ANY new regulation on firearms just bans the sale not make fucking criminals out of people who werent breaking the law in the first place im fuckin pissed
206 2018-10-03 22:11:00 Works in NYC and does boring things with numbers. It may or may not invoke banks, bonds and stocks. Could potentially compromise morals. Could also potentially make lots of money. 
207 2018-10-03 22:09:41 @cvpayne Why not talk about the FACT that there is a connect between the benchmark and market breadth, this rally has been driven by a few good stocks?? Many equity funds have fallen this week, WITH bonds & the European equity MESS.. ???
208 2018-10-03 22:09:28 Apparently he bought stocks from companies that were merging then sold them like the next day so I think he just got flagged. Then they started looking in it
209 2018-10-03 22:08:58 Honestly what work has he done? It took him a year to ban bump stocks after that mass vagas shooting
210 2018-10-03 22:08:56 How can we trade Nigerian stocks??
211 2018-10-03 22:08:55 We still have children in camps. 1 year after Vegas shooting and congress hasn’t even banned bump stocks.
212 2018-10-03 22:08:34 I’m tryna get my mental state on white folks level ... they dgaf about shoes  Clothes none of that ... they pay they bills and put they money up  Take Trips Buy Land Stocks & bonds mutual funds All the Good Shit
213 2018-10-03 22:07:24 Clearly you did not trade stocks ‘97-‘03
214 2018-10-03 22:07:11 Do you find these companies through @StocksToTrade?
215 2018-10-03 22:06:38 That's sucks. You were lucky in getting monthly bonuses and stocks.
216 2018-10-03 22:06:06 I prefer U&Rs that occur on days when the market is down and then shows support - stocks breaking lows on days when the market is up are much less appetizing...
217 2018-10-03 22:06:05 Stocks that reinvest their capital have future projects in the pipeline to transcend the stock price today. Putting capital to work. Stocks that burn cash in the form of a dividend lack those investment opportunities: leading to the type of underperformance you see.
218 2018-10-03 22:05:36 Cut losses and invest them in growth stocks
219 2018-10-03 22:04:12 ... and stocks keep going up! Normal! What could go wrong?
220 2018-10-03 22:03:58 Have you ever seen it snow corn stocks across the road? 
221 2018-10-03 22:02:54 Rates usually trail oil by ~3 weeks, so October should get fun here soon. Stocks down, bonds down. Nowhere to hide unless you know how to short. Giddy up!
222 2018-10-03 22:01:51 That one string where you z drop a bomb and recatch it with Bair twice just to look cool between stocks.
223 2018-10-03 22:01:28 The Fed WILL protect the long bond market and sacrifice stocks.  They have to!
224 2018-10-03 22:01:13 Extremely new to trading penny stocks. Very excited about the possibilities. Learning all I can before actually trading.
225 2018-10-03 22:01:02 As an adoptee, I totally felt it
226 2018-10-03 22:00:38 uhhhhh a billionaire investing is a catalyst, please use @stockstotrade and see my Spikeability DVD so you're not confused anymore
227 2018-10-03 22:00:11 Has anyone noticed how the Twitter Police  are okay to Ramp their sh*te stocks & that’s okay coz they are the Twitter Police but jump all over anyone promoting a stock they’re not in and labelling that as Ramping & despicable. It’s laughable. Crooks calling others crooks. Ha

230 2018-10-03 21:58:46 No reason to overcomplicate the market.  When you see 5 different low float stocks around .15 cents double in a week.  Chances are more in that price range will do the same.  It can be a hot Sector or Theme that triggers moves.  Fundamentals usually have little to do with it.
231 2018-10-03 21:58:13 I thought the idea of listening to @jimcramer was to actually stimulate thinking and lead us to further do homework to better understand stocks he suggests or dislikes. I appreciate his conversations
232 2018-10-03 21:56:56 Do you only watch a few stocks or do you only pay attn to what the charts are telling you (of course while keeping industry trends, fed news etc. in mind)?

235 2018-10-03 21:55:55 People living paycheck to paycheck do not own stocks. What have you done for them? Get out of your bubble and see how real people live.
236 2018-10-03 21:55:41 I agree with bloomberg though

Pls extend your coverage, number of stocks so limited.. just a request.
237 2018-10-03 21:55:40 It isn’t about the Second Amendment, it’s about gun control.  This is not a difficult concept.  What about bump stocks? Illegal yet? No?  Why not?  Wake up, smell the roses, GUN CONTROL is NOT a bad thing!!

240 2018-10-03 21:54:24 Hightimes advertising commercially to get investors. Coming this Oct.17 Marijuana will be federally solidified & state officially so we’ll have to see the cannabis sector reacts then.

257 2018-10-03 21:44:23 Although I made money on $IGC yesterday afternoon (more than I lost on it today) these sub-$10 junk stocks are quite simply not a strong area for me; I do not have edge in them.

260 2018-10-03 21:43:23 Agreed. The stock is very illiquid. Filling my buys and sells have been difficult. Personally, given my 90% exposure to U stocks, my mental game does better with a bit of risk off the table now and a bit of money in my pocket.

Even if they weren't, the combination of BOTH of these, is still less than my increase.

326 2018-10-03 21:14:08 but that's where relative strength comes in. These railroads and medical equipment stocks, for example have been working and is really nothing new. #KISS type stuff $CSX $MDT etc etc

369 2018-10-03 20:55:50 Yes.  Arrest him and then put him in stocks, pillory, and pranger in a public square so everyone can throw rotten vegetables at him.
370 2018-10-03 20:55:45 How is it a sweet deal if they're taking away our stocks and our bonus?????
371 2018-10-03 20:55:44 In the bank?

Interest?

Do you get any?

Money in the bank provides capitol for banks to invest. 
In stocks, loans or mortgages and businesses.

The reason they pay interest, or used to.
Money doesn't ever rust.
372 2018-10-03 20:54:38 We'll see. I own energy stocks in my Zacks portfolios and in my own personal portfolio. But if crude goes to $80, it means much higher earnings for oil companies.

374 2018-10-03 20:53:39 For those celebrating Amazon for increased wages hold on a minute. It's true Amazon increased wages, bit simultaneously cut incentives like bonuses and stocks, leaving employees with less money. Great work Amazon!

376 2018-10-03 20:51:46 Still in since 2013 and suffering every day crappy stocks are fetching billions of $ in market cap while BB hovers near ATL and John Chen and BOD just give a damn shit
377 2018-10-03 20:50:53 Oh, I hope my stocks went up.
378 2018-10-03 20:50:34 Stephen Paddock was permitted to purchase 47 firearms along with trigger cranks and bump stocks to convert his semi-automatics into automatic weapons. If he needs this many firearms for hunting, then he must suck at it  Time for a new hobby?

380 2018-10-03 20:48:43 Pared back exposure to stocks this past week. Sold my positions in $ARKW, $AMD, and cannabis $OGI.V. Taking profits + limiting losses.
381 2018-10-03 20:47:33 It will come in stocks, be patient 
382 2018-10-03 20:46:32 The biggest change they made is with the stocks they give to their employee's, essentially no longer providing them. Logic being their employees would rather "get the cash up front" with the raise.
383 2018-10-03 20:46:29 
384 2018-10-03 20:45:33 If only I could forget some 80s trivia and replace it with something like stocks and bonds.
385 2018-10-03 20:45:07 Market Review through Q3 2018 - A lot of fluctuation/volatility in the overall markets, however stocks as a whole (large gains in some industries offset by struggling in others) have maintained steady gains. DJIA - up about 8%, S&P500 - up about 9.5% from first 2018 trading day.
386 2018-10-03 20:44:32 Diluting shares tend to decay price a lot quicker. This is their best last chance to get a bank approve some senior notes. When the stocks drop, thats when they are left with last resort, issue shares.
387 2018-10-03 20:44:18 I'm about to start charging people for my time if people keep asking me how to do stocks lol
388 2018-10-03 20:44:04 @FadesolaSotinwa @UgochiTVCNEWS @tvcnewsng Well stocks are down, when you Lagosians rejected Ambode, British & German Companies were ready to invest in Lagos after Mrs May and Angela Merkle's visit
389 2018-10-03 20:43:11 Fake News :)  the number 1 thing I use my Apple Watch for is checking stocks, extremely convenient and glanceable
390 2018-10-03 20:43:10 Very rare....see below:

Dow closed yesterday at new high; however > 3x as many stocks hit 52w lows than 52w highs on NYSE...since 1965, it’s happened only one other time: December 28, 1999 @sentimentrader
391 2018-10-03 20:43:01 AND ......you'd better dump your stocks, gonna be a bumpy ride, like when Obama took office.

396 2018-10-03 20:41:23 Stocks not liking Powell much.
397 2018-10-03 20:41:10 Well, it's no 2016 or 2017, that's for sure. 2018 has been the year of the chop and ROTATION. I noticed 2018, you have to hold stocks less and shift money from sector to sector much often than in previous years.
398 2018-10-03 20:40:59 I agree with everything you said couldn't of worded it any better but those stocks in general are nothing but a gamble wouldn't you consider them to be all wildcards?

408 2018-10-03 20:37:23 Trump was given credit for the economy back in Feb when stocks dropped 10% . No take backs when it chugs along again.
409 2018-10-03 20:37:06 Yes, still holding. news was out today. give it few more days . people busy in penny stocks these days
410 2018-10-03 20:36:41 I don't think there's a money flow link that directly. stocks can go down without needing bonds to do something.
411 2018-10-03 20:36:36 Um no they didn't. The actually asked for more regulations on bump stocks
412 2018-10-03 20:35:59 Mahosive lump on my arm, which surprises me as it didn’t even hurt. Don’t think I will be able to put my uniform on tomorrow!  
413 2018-10-03 20:35:52 Today was very similar to 2/1/18. Bonds down big, stocks close to flat, and VXX off a touch near it's recent lows. Fireworks kicked off the next day. Hope the risk parity guys aren't too eager to rebalance to attractive yields on ST bonds...
414 2018-10-03 20:35:25 I've pointed out to the guy who stocks Funimation's vending that NO ONE drinks Monster and Red Bull is always gone... hence he should replace all Monster with Red Bull.  Red Bull > Monster proven
415 2018-10-03 20:35:15 Totally agree with @DevoT and @mhpholdings on this one. This was a very healthy pullback for that low float. We've had a week of green, one red day and now it's going to crash? Give me a break. Stocks go up and stocks go down. Nothing has fundamentally changed here..
416 2018-10-03 20:35:07 Please tell me the other stocks your into...
417 2018-10-03 20:34:56 I still don’t understand why libs hate Trump so much. Economy is better, unemployment is better, stocks are up, businesses are coming back from overseas, wages are on the rise, etc etc etc. If Obama’s policies had caused these things, they’d be shouting it from the rooftops
418 2018-10-03 20:34:54 Although the stock market is having a good day, the stocks we invested a majority our money in, are not! We are hoping for a better day tomorrow to recover from our overall gain of -.12%. #SUACCF18

420 2018-10-03 20:33:47 I would wager equities to seriously start falling somewhere between Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. Yield curve should invert around Q3/Q4 2019. Stocks should most likely start tumbling within 6-12 months after that. And CBs will panic and likely go full QE-mode 3-6 months thereafter

426 2018-10-03 20:28:47 This rate level is less than half October 1987 levels before the crash.  Stocks will move higher still

429 2018-10-03 20:27:52 Ahh yeah the "vested stock" thing. Easy way to defer payouts in the hopes that the employees quit before they can sell. Bait tier 1 employment with stocks, work them to the bone, and get them to quit before they can cash them out. $15/hr is a far better deal.

439 2018-10-03 20:20:55 tbh i feel the stock would absolutely skyrocket if they just announced theyre gonna drop moviepass alltogether and do other shit

443 2018-10-03 20:19:56 $TLRY  why we  on stocks w offerings behind them.

Impossible to know in real-time if the rush of #cannabis offerings (IPO’s / secondaries) will lead to short-term saturation but I DO believe over *time* demand > supply, perhaps egregiously so.  

No position

Russell 2000 +0.9% after recent slump. Winners top losers 19/12 on Nasdaq; losers have edge on NYSE
446 2018-10-03 20:18:37 You're allowed to care about whatever you want. You made a claim about the whole sector. If you want to claim that the stocks you care about = the whole sector, that's just elementarily false. See ya.

451 2018-10-03 20:16:45 Wed was the anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting. Why are bump stocks still a thing? Guess you’re working really hard on improving school safety.
452 2018-10-03 20:16:12 Did you ban assault weapon? Did you increase background checks? Did you ban bump stocks? Did you raise the minimum age to purchase? Did you increase funding for mental health and after school programs? Nope? Then you did nothing.

456 2018-10-03 20:15:15 World stocks ex Asia rise: Europe +.5%; US +.1%. A sharp rose in interest-rates is and will pressure bond-proxy stocks like REITs, utilities & other high-dividend stocks. Pressure could continue through 2019.  Best bet is still high-quality stocks with increasing earnings.

460 2018-10-03 20:13:03 As far as I know, the Fed's QE program didn't include stocks. Given that most of the reserves created ended up collecting interest in an excess balance account at the Fed, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that "QE money"went directly into stocks or any other asset class.

482 2018-10-03 20:05:10 Foreign investors have already pulled back over $9 billion from Indian stocks and bonds this year. #Oil prices may surge to $100 per barrel this year. Rupee down by over 12% !
483 2018-10-03 20:05:00 Stocks rise. The Dow closed at 26,828.39, up 54.45 (+0.20%). Nasdaq +0.32%. S&P +0.07%.
484 2018-10-03 20:04:36 I asked an advisor who tactically traded stocks for her clients how much of her portfolio was in the same stocks. She said none, all of her money is in real estate for diversification. If the stock market blows up or she blows her clients up she didn’t want to lose too
485 2018-10-03 20:03:21 #PresidentYetiPubes, please explain for the about half of the US population who don't own stocks why the increase in the indices is important to them and how we can spread prosperity across all levels of our country? Or does the cat have your twitter fingers?

487 2018-10-03 20:02:54 If bonds sell off, short-term interest rates rise - if bonds buy up, interest rates fall. Since there is SO much corporate debt, if interest rates get too high, profit margins get squeezed by interest -> bad for earnings ->bad for companies -> bad for stocks.
488 2018-10-03 20:02:02 Sold some of my stocks finally. Made about $450.

490 2018-10-03 20:01:46 I hear you. Trading on fundamentals and sentiment may get you out very early in the trend, or not in at all. This bull market in stocks is a great example of why trading with the trend wins in the long run.

623 2018-10-03 18:52:28 Clinton passed the three strikes law while having stocks in private prisons. He sent one missile to target bin laden, killing civilians, and said that was fine. He took advantage of a young woman with absolutely no power and has had very credible rape accusations against him.

654 2018-10-03 18:45:09 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

666 2018-10-03 18:40:17 It's done negative harm. For reasonable assumptions about market behaviour, almost any weighting scheme is better than mkt cap, which ensures maximum weighting of the most overvalued stocks.

673 2018-10-03 18:35:58 Penn Central had great revenues, earnings, huge book value. They collapsed probably as fast as Lehman Bros. No measurement is the end all be all, although I would agree that a lot of stocks today are absurd.
674 2018-10-03 18:35:33 You called Obama a liar. Given our current president that is LAUGHABLE. The Richest 10% of people own 84% of stocks. So it's dishonest to suggest this is good for typical Americans. This is what dishonest people use as evidence Trump is helping them. It's silly.
675 2018-10-03 18:35:21 The overwhelming consensus view is that the combination of high starting valuations, #debt, demographics, #productivity and the reversal of global #QE all point to a mediocre outlook for stocks.  It’s compelling but I am open to a more bullish view.

684 2018-10-03 18:32:55 They raise the minimum wage but take away all our other incentives. Our VCP and stocks are being taken away. So really not a raise.
685 2018-10-03 18:32:09 How much longer can stocks compete with a 3% 10Y Treasury? At 3.5  or 4%, it is not even a question. They can't.

716 2018-10-03 18:23:01 Once all the exchanges are made USD coming back goes to crypto market instead of causing hyperinflation in US; every crypto has USD backing and can be traded/exchanged; company shares, stocks, bonds, can also be tokenized becaue there's USD to do it; they can be traded, as well.

790 2018-10-03 17:56:02 They actually lowered overall compensation. They took away employee incentive pay, stocks, etc that will cost workers $3-6k per yr, and most were already at $15 if they had been there a few years. So minimum wage is now more like $10 without the stock/incentive pay.

It’s VERY clear you don’t want this job, and your incompetence is detrimental to our society. Resign.

$GCAN, $RGLS, $RFP, $SN, $ATNM, $WPRT, $ARRY, $RRC.
796 2018-10-03 17:53:20 It just has to hold its trend. So a previous low. (see quarterly chart) But you can protect if it weakens or reduce. There is never a one size fits all answer for stocks.

798 2018-10-03 17:50:39 I keep saying this may be the strangest year for the markets since ... well ever.  As odd as 1999 was at least stock correlations made sense.  The "amount" things moved was stupid but how stocks themselves moved vs. each other was consistent with prior cycles.
799 2018-10-03 17:50:28 For sure. And the emotion/fear has always been in stocks a lot too. And commodities. I remember trading oil futures a few years back, and it was ridiculous. News: "Some guy in Iran burned a US flag!" Investors: "Oh shit, Gulf War 3! Let's panic and buy WAY above market!"
800 2018-10-03 17:49:47 4 stocks I like for bounces at current prices vs lows from today or yesterday (latest price):

801 2018-10-03 17:49:32 I enter at market order. Easier in fast markets. I'm always trading amd, fb, nflx, aapl...basically these high volume stocks. Tdameritrade said that their option  buys/sells requires a review process, which I'm assuming is part of the 20-50 seconds wait.

803 2018-10-03 17:48:00 Also there is a gang trying to trick the retail investors into buying the illiquid Preferreds so that the H-Funds switch to Commons, with far greater upside because they are the real Equity stocks, not Fixed Income Securities like the JPS.

804 2018-10-03 17:47:33 Friendly reminder that your well-diversified portfolio probably won’t perform the same as the common benchmarks you see in the news (S&P 500, Dow Jones). 

Nor should it. Those benchmarks are an asset class (large US stocks)...not an investment plan.

Makes sense to me but what do I know.
879 2018-10-03 17:14:41 Thanks to your TaxScam corporate CEO’s are buying back stocks at record numbers! Which raise the price of stocks. Nobody believes you anymore...some of us never believed you! #RESIGN

881 2018-10-03 17:13:41 5% is usually an above average move for most stocks in a single day. So 5% and above is what I look for.
882 2018-10-03 17:13:08 Are all stocks joint at the hip?  is that how stock work??  
883 2018-10-03 17:13:08 Sell, a 40% dump will occur anytime. No more stocks here.
884 2018-10-03 17:13:08 That said this is bad for employees with tenure. The longer you stay, the more it diminishes your gains. Ill onoy be getting about $1 raise. Ill lose about $2k in bonus and then lose about $4k worth of stocks i would have recieved this year. But 15 is super great for new hires.
885 2018-10-03 17:12:57 Once the masses accept every pullback as simply another buying opportunity and ignore the risk in stocks, the end of a bull market is near.  This was the case during virtually every strong bull market in history.

891 2018-10-03 17:11:57 Ask @SenSanders if he knows that @JeffBezos actually cut hourly workers incentives plans, stocks, bonus for perfect attendance, etc, so he could "afford" raising the minimum to $15, which most Amazon workers are already at. Yesterday was a $3-5k a yr pay cut for Amazon workers.

912 2018-10-03 17:04:30 It seems like the stocks and jobs are the only points for your administration to brag about.
What about that wall you were screaming about 2 years ago?
913 2018-10-03 17:04:26 Sadly that's not what happened. Amazon yesterday told employees that they were cutting their incentive plans, bonuses, stocks, etc., so they could raise the minimum to $15, which most Amazon workers are already at. So Amazon workers lost $3-6k per yr yesterday. Huge step back.
914 2018-10-03 17:04:18 True, I'm upset they haven't said a peep on Tilray other than a blanket warning on "pot stocks" a month ago.
915 2018-10-03 17:03:46 In the mean time the government has to off load these stocks. Either for PDS or Food Security schemes or OPen Market Sale Schemes. Now price will be high for southern states for Wheat when compared to international prices. So Govt will impose import duty. 3/n

950 2018-10-03 16:50:20 I have two theses going forward:
 
1. Current bull run pauses (violently) at S&P $3,695.88 (ultimately setting up S&P $10,000 but we’ll have time to discuss that on a few years). 

2. Publicly traded pot stocks are long-term Fool’s Gold. If you like that sector go VC or stay out.

965 2018-10-03 16:44:59 Most employees who were at Amazon for a few years were already at or above $15, so the VCP/RSU (incentives, stocks) that Amazon took away from their hourly workers yesterday is a huge paycut. If husband and wife both work there, they probably took a $10k per yr pay cut yesterday.

1005 2018-10-03 16:29:46 It may, it may not recover soon. Given that there is a question on governance. Share stocks are affected more by poor governance than by stellar performance. Trust is lost, can't say what else they might be cooking in their books?
1006 2018-10-03 16:29:33 and if you ACTUALLY knew about stocks and how things work.. Nike's valuation was placed higher than it should have been... Wait and see how it turns out.. let's table this for 3 months and then continue this conversation.

1011 2018-10-03 16:28:15 A lot of sub dollar pennies are running right now. Suspect that money will start hitting stocks around $3-$5 range soon. Best to build positions into those now before vol.

1025 2018-10-03 16:23:57 Sadly, rumors are amazon workers are getting other benefits taken away who make more than $15, like stocks and such, made worse by they are blaming the workers who got a raise, instead of the bosses at amazon for taking them away. Classic, execs pitting middle against the lower.

1035 2018-10-03 16:19:57 @ScottWapnerCNBC The market is VERY split and narrowing. New lows surging. More than 5% of NYSE stocks at new lows. % of stocks above 200 day ma is declining and down to 55%.
1036 2018-10-03 16:19:40 I’m ending this at. The matter is being investigated and we will know in the coming weeks or months. But don’t discount the situation just because. Now get back to looking at stocks
1037 2018-10-03 16:19:35 It doesn't matter how much money you make, what matters is how much money you manage to keep.

The majority of people spend ALL the money that they make, and then they wonder why they stay broke every month. They have no #investment seeds, no #crypto, no #stocks, and no savings.
1038 2018-10-03 16:19:05 Don't forget VCP pay as well, which you could get double during peak season. But yeah, stocks, incentives can easily add $3-5k a year, and many Amazon employees were already at $15 if they had been there a few years depending on facility. So most took pay cuts yesterday.

1051 2018-10-03 16:14:03 This is a pay cut for 2+ year employees. Don't be fooled. Its a redistribution of wealth within the lower associates of the company. Taking from the veteran workers to give more to the new hires. After taking our stocks and VCP we now make $1 an hour LESS.

1087 2018-10-03 16:05:15 At your next rally you vent at like a clown ask your MAGA red hat lovers to do this. Ask the people there that benefit from the increase of stocks you brag about to get up and leave the building. How many will go?  Your nothing but entertainment to them all.
1088 2018-10-03 16:05:13 Nope, most Amazon Fulfillment Center employees yesterday got pay cuts, not pay raises. Hourly employees got VCP and RSU benefits cut (incentives for perfect attendance, productivity rates, stocks, etc), which means they make less now. Salaried employees (management) keeps theirs.
1089 2018-10-03 16:05:01 A healthy correction in stocks is like giving a second chance for an error of omission. However, the trick is not to commit an error of commission while buying the bargain. Be sure of what you are buying and understand that value and price converge eventually but not immediately.

1100 2018-10-03 15:59:42 Yeah, and all it cost was adding $1T+ debt so these companies can buy back their stocks - a temporary stunt that only benefits stockholders, while jeopardizing our future solvency. You’re running the US like one of your bankrupt companies. RESIGN!

1110 2018-10-03 15:56:33 A tip we received from our financial advisor: Socking money away in multiple "buckets" (529, 401k, IRA's, stocks) can provide multiple levers to pull when it comes time to fund college, which can be a benefit depending on your financial situation in the future.
1111 2018-10-03 15:56:25 Mark Twain wrote on investing, “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February"

1117 2018-10-03 15:53:20 @RogerandJP they’re raising the wages but they are dropping the stock benefits for the employees. So they make more but will no longer receive stocks in the company as part of their benefit package.

1123 2018-10-03 15:51:54 Unfortunately Amazon also cut their VCP and RSU for employees. This was incentive programs and stocks that was part of an entire compensation package. Most employees will now make less annually due to these changes. Makes for good press, but actually hurts the overall worker.

1126 2018-10-03 15:50:22 There's so many weird stocks that have exploded though - who knows where it will be in 5 years.  I certainly didn't expect what we're seeing in $Etsy, $Grub, $lulu, $SQ... In all sectors, all industries.  Or........ maybe we're in a massive bubble??  :)
1127 2018-10-03 15:50:15 If you could only own one of these stocks, which one would you choose?
$AMZN $AAPL $GOOGL $NFLX

1162 2018-10-03 15:40:14 Stocks and bonuses are variable and come with all sorts of strings attached. Temp employees, for example, don't benefit.

I'm also for unions so that you can fight for bonuses and stock options.

1185 2018-10-03 15:33:24 Just give honest answer, How much your strategy has lost so far by buying into gold & EM stocks.
1186 2018-10-03 15:33:11 i was really surprised on that move up to $325 almost non stop...somebody got squeezed big time, but seems to have settled in at this level (+ -) 20 pts. stocks that go vertical tend to take a breather off from that top & therefore it'll   probably rest unless there's a big beat!
1187 2018-10-03 15:32:50 Yields at 7 yr highs. Any breakout above this level spells trouble for stocks. 3 percent was first scare, where's the next?
1188 2018-10-03 15:32:50 Distribution day yesterday and hot money moving into “safe” Dow stocks. Could be nearing the end of this bull.
1189 2018-10-03 15:32:16 mannn... it’s hella work. you gotta keep up with the shits daily and not sell fast even if you see a big drop. Just bc you lose $20 one day doesn’t mean you won’t gain that plus $80 more the next. Stocks have bad days.

1207 2018-10-03 15:28:25 AT SOME POINT TODAY    STOCKS SHOULD REALIZE YIELDS
1208 2018-10-03 15:28:17 $INDU is a price weighted index, meaning the highest priced stocks affect it the most: $BA is 9.5% of the DOW, and been on tear lately. $UNH is 6.5%, same story. $AAPL is 5.6%, same story. Thus three companies make up >20% of the DOW. Says enough.
1209 2018-10-03 15:27:39 Why do you support the ban on bump stocks?
1210 2018-10-03 15:27:31 Everyone gets VCP , stocks i believe its only for full time employees including hourly. Part time and those that work at amazon through a temp agency don't get stocks.
1211 2018-10-03 15:27:21 The stock market has nothing to do with the national budget. If you don't have stocks, you're not going to see any benefit. Who can afford stocks? The rich.

1266 2018-10-03 15:15:16 @realDonaldTrump a ban on bump stocks will solve nothing.  It only gives the anti second amendment crowd a win, and pushes us one step further down that slippery slope.
1267 2018-10-03 15:15:16 #3500EDGELuigi Tesla stocks have fallen tremendously since Elon's interview with Joe Rogan. He clearly was not thinking about the big picture. Cannot do that in such a leadership position.
1268 2018-10-03 15:15:09 Short version: USD coming back goes to crypto market instead of causing hyperinflation in US; every crypto has USD backing and can be traded/exchanged; company shares, stocks, bonds, can also be tokenized cuz there's USD to do it; they can be traded, as well.

1294 2018-10-03 15:09:37 They actually ended up getting a pay cut because with this “raise” (most already make $14-$15/hr) they are losing their bonuses right before peak season. There are also rumors of this fucking with their stocks.

1314 2018-10-03 15:03:30 We've been praising Dividend Stocks for so long that now the average investor will rarely consider a non dividend stock for their portfolio.

And by doing that they buy stocks where share price continue to depreciate and believe that dividends will make up for that underperform.

America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
1331 2018-10-03 14:59:00 Nice job!
1332 2018-10-03 14:58:53 while at the same time, some of the brokerage houses has given a buy call with such a huge target some days before. Actually now a days some brokerage houses are giving buy call on stocks in which their own money is stucked.

1499 2018-10-03 14:19:50 Did they mention they took some  of the benefits away like VCP and RSU (stocks) with this raise. It sucks for people who actually put there time in.

1504 2018-10-03 14:18:46 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. ~ Peter Lynch

Investments that would bring me joy & returns would be:-

2) Mix of Debt + Equity Mutual Fund.
3) Stocks + Annuities
1522 2018-10-03 14:15:25 Luxury goods and stocks are similar, when the price is higher the perceived wisdom is that they are intrinsically more valuable. 

In both cases, they may or may not be more intrinsically valuable with a higher price, but the price shouldn’t be your signal.

1601 2018-10-03 13:58:06 The strongest stocks of the past 3-6 months, mostly consumer & IT,  were the ones which sold off today. When the strongest names fall after significant damage in the broad market for several days, usually it means that capitulation is in final stage.
1602 2018-10-03 13:57:14 Growth stocks don’t go up 5% every day. It’s called healthy consolidation, which every growth and momentum investor (not day traders) should WELCOME.
1603 2018-10-03 13:56:34 im not saying it cant move 7% or 10%, we all know this stock and many stocks can be very volatile. but the narrative was $AMD taking real share from a struggling $INTC...these banks should atleast come out and clarify this. Cowen? RBC? Stifel? Jefferies? all of them

1630 2018-10-03 13:49:20 The biggest thing when it comes to stocks, and penny stocks more so, is understanding gains. 

A good day for a stock is +3%

So when something opens +150% and closes at "only" up 20%, that's still a really really fucking good day. 

And you can expect more.
1631 2018-10-03 13:49:15 Yup. Dow is 30 stocks, as you know. Only need 5 or 6 moving to "show what looks like a good market."

1643 2018-10-03 13:46:43 A minor but (maybe?) relevant point for this analysis: RVRS and RSP aren't really "similiar ETFs." RVRS weights S&P 500 stocks in reverse: the first shall be last and the last shall be first. RSP, by contrast, equally weights the S&P 500.

Do you think it will be a negative correlation or positive correlation with cryptos ?

1654 2018-10-03 13:44:58 Yesterday the Dow rallied 122 points, however, the strength of the Dow is masking the market’s internal weakness. The Russell 2000 fell 1%. Declining stocks led by 8:5 on the NYSE and over 2:1 on the Nasdaq; declining stocks have led in six out of the last ten trading sessions.

1702 2018-10-03 13:30:21 Fair point on the tax drag on dividends, but investors can reduce this impact by holding dividend stocks in IRAs/ISAs. Berkshire is a top 1% capital allocator; most firms would misspend excess capital and should therefore return cash via dividends or systematic buybacks.
1703 2018-10-03 13:28:33 You shouldn’t be in crypto right now. It’s in a bear market and there’s no evidence suggesting otherwise.

If you are not in cash, you should be in S&P. Stocks are in a bull market, and there’s no evidence suggesting suggesting otherwise.

When S&P, @cz_binance?

1736 2018-10-03 13:17:18 Stocks are a part of the economy and not the whole factor.. since the discussion is on stocks I am sticking to stocks. India was the world's fastest growing major economy and I stand by that statement. Your other points are going on a tangent and not relevant to stocks.

1738 2018-10-03 13:17:04 None of these stocks have much of a history so determining the value of options by looking at the past is not very useful. I would say traditional price discovery if making markets in these. That is move prices up until the orderflow comes in with sellers.
1739 2018-10-03 13:16:58 I started buying stocks and just made a $1 profit. I think you can say I’m an expert now
1740 2018-10-03 13:16:22 Don't equate the stock market to the economy. What's the percentage of population owns stocks?
1741 2018-10-03 13:16:12 Brazilian stocks +7% again today on another positive poll for Bolsonaro, the right's candidate. +13% in two days on two polls. Polls.
1742 2018-10-03 13:15:55 For 1%. I don’t own stocks. I don’t know anyone that does.
1743 2018-10-03 13:15:46 Took a shot and watched @TheResident_Fox the other night where the med device rep stocks outside a patient’s room, listens to the Pts treatment options and barges in offering an expensive device...dramatic but this is so off base from reality #hippa #ethics

1746 2018-10-03 13:14:57 Many daytraders or big traders have taken to smaller stocks and then playing with them so many biotechs and small caps are targeted each day. They do this every year for months and then leave them.
1747 2018-10-03 13:14:53 The new iPhone stocks app finally has a search function so I don’t have to scroll through 300+ symbols too see the one I want 
1748 2018-10-03 13:14:46 Your right! Stocks at 140ish now.

Looking to get out at 142.50
1749 2018-10-03 13:14:09 Many have been. But there are also many unprofitable stocks in the Russell 2000, which don't get much benefit. And smaller companies are less able to pass on cost increases. Plus, the Russell is more heavily weighted in financials.

1752 2018-10-03 13:13:41 Something I am thinking about as I listen to the podcast now is that by making the portfolio have only American stocks aren't we perpetuating a culture of importing? I get that not doing it like this would go against it's purpose though.
1753 2018-10-03 13:13:40 Morning Market Update: stocks trade higher on upbeat jobs data.
1754 2018-10-03 13:13:38 This isnt like the dropbear or stocks is it? Like an urban legend?
1755 2018-10-03 13:13:24 My husband and I own stocks and have a 401K.  We're nowhere near the top of anything.  Let's keep going with that bullish market (the one thing I agree with Trump on). Obama got us out of a huge recession and rescued the economy. He probably doesn't get enough thanks for that.

1758 2018-10-03 13:12:55 Your trump influenced stocks have literally been stagnant all year. Anothe lie you bought into. The market has been fed flat since January. You don’t actually have any stocks though so it’s moot. You’re as full of shit as your nominee to the Supreme Court.
1759 2018-10-03 13:12:35 Ur base doesn't own stocks. Mostly those who are in the top 1-2 %. Americans see who u r. Ur the Grifter-in-Chief. We're voting u out in '18 & '20! Then we're impeaching U!

1760 2018-10-03 13:12:18 She also makes laughing stocks of people who have actually endured and survived such a horrific experience. But that doesn’t bother the Socialist Democrats. Irregardless of who gets burned or how their own integrity suffers; their power grab is paramount. So sad.
1761 2018-10-03 13:12:06 I mean, wow. If I had any stocks, that'd be great.
1762 2018-10-03 13:11:50 Job numbers are climbing with the stocks. I really dont think the negative people know why they hate Trump doing good things, I dont think I will ever understand them. Our economy is improving.
1763 2018-10-03 13:11:38 That explains the miraculous strength of BILI as of late... all Chinese stocks in freefall but them.
1764 2018-10-03 13:11:07 @AOTtrades Morning coach! Any small cap stocks in particular you will be watching for a red opening and a following bounce?
1765 2018-10-03 13:10:36 Donald Trump would be richer today if he’d just taken the money he inherited and invested it in stocks and bonds.
1766 2018-10-03 13:10:33 When will you sign an order outlawing bump stocks? That's a quick easy one. Have you gotten permission from the NRA yet?
1767 2018-10-03 13:10:15 You gotta have stocks to sell them. Not sure Joanne has any. Twitter verse is a make believe world where you talk like your parents never thought you manners. Sad thing is many soon become what they practice on SM.
1768 2018-10-03 13:09:24 Craig is basically still a junior analyst from a bucket shop.  Few credible sellsiders left in semis.  Having said that, am sure 1-2 pre’s and my guess is rally on them as biz vol is low yet many stocks 10-12x with massive FCF
1769 2018-10-03 13:09:05 The stock market affects people who own stocks. If ur working/middle class without a stock portfolio *all time highs* mean nothing to them. #BraggartinChief #DespicablePiginChief #StopKavanaugh #NoKavanaugh #MeToo #NotMyPresident

1772 2018-10-03 13:06:53 Most Americans don't own stocks, so this means little to them.
1773 2018-10-03 13:06:53 Missed you Borat!!!

Let's hope the rich elites keep buying their own company's stocks only further inflating the economy instead of working to raise wages for middle class Americans. What could possibly ever go wrong?
1774 2018-10-03 13:06:25 Most ppl I know do not have stocks!
1775 2018-10-03 13:05:10 If you told me this on my Maximalist Mastodon account, I'd agree, but since I'm on mainstream centrist Twitter abd don't want to be Alex Jones'ed, I'm going to say this is probably true for the top 5 money stocks. You can then derive them into currency and use that as stake.

1784 2018-10-03 13:01:46 This is so funny. Isn’t that what you propose to do with cost basis for stocks sold? Index the cost to inflation? Wow what a double standard. And what about the truth.  Yes it’s a negative piece but have u lied about your success and did you commit tax fraud?

Do your own research,be responsible for ur actions
1797 2018-10-03 12:54:39 The Justice Department confirmed that a proposed rule to ban bump stocks  was sent late last week to the Office of Management and Budget for  review. After a review that could last up to 90 days, the proposal will  be published in the Federal Register, inviting public comment.
1798 2018-10-03 12:54:32 bro, u alrdy shared a Pic of ur fav stocks. 
If possible pls share ur fav MP related books and Price action books. 
Thanks bro.
1799 2018-10-03 12:54:17 Crucial analysis. The number of stocks in an index does not equal diversification if the tail weights dont add up to anything material. This is valuable content for investors.
1800 2018-10-03 12:54:10 #Investing 

Individual stocks bottom out at DIFFERENT times. 

Some before the #nifty, some after it. 

One can't really call the exact bottom for each of them. 

As an #investor your role is to deploy cash when valuations are reasonable as per your calculations or judgement.
1801 2018-10-03 12:53:57 I'm trying to work my way our of the PDT rule as it keeps me from shorting and that's half the money crossing as you guide these plays to perfection. But, I can't see going back to being one dementional trading only penny stocks. So would love to get your trade the open course.
1802 2018-10-03 12:53:48 And historically in stocks you have a bull edge, so in that case, always bet on rising indices!!
1803 2018-10-03 12:53:33 don't worry, hangga't mat stocks pa. magoopen akong group order
1804 2018-10-03 12:52:05 What about the money $145 million Hillary Clinton got? And she sold a top national security resource we don't have enough of to our (according to dems) so-called enemy! What about her campaign mgr John Podesta? he got millions in money and stocks from Russia? #DemsAreDevils #MAGA
1805 2018-10-03 12:50:44 Looking at individual stocks and portfolio as a whole, selling between 9:30 - 10:30 and buying back at 3:30 would be very profitable routine. RARE are closes at daily highs.

1820 2018-10-03 12:44:22 Have to wait and see how stocks look at the open. I need to gauge the strength (or lack of strength) in my stocks lists.

1830 2018-10-03 12:39:56 Lot less pressure to kick accurately for goal at the combine if you’re a defender. Not saying this kid won’t be a very good kick at goal in the AFL, but it’s no real blow to his draft stocks if he kicks 0.5. The real value  of this drill lies in seeing what the forwards do

1837 2018-10-03 12:37:21 ergo, do you think there is a market, maybe will sell lots of stocks and shares...you could even have an app for the fees, and a third-party collector who makes profit from anyone who would like to attend an adult kindergarten? Huge gap in the market for this...

1864 2018-10-03 12:25:11 @iang_fc World financial crisis may reduce individual BTC demand, but major banks will be forced to turn to gold & BTC holdings as the fiat+derivatives+inflatedAssets house of cards collapses for real this time. BTC a lot better than inflated real estate & stocks.
1865 2018-10-03 12:25:06 and that is also a big reason why stocks became so expensive too.

1869 2018-10-03 12:23:19 95% of my Twitter feed is people tweeting about stocks that are already up huge.  Such a waste of time to focus on those, want to be successful long term, stop gambling on continued cash flow, start focusing on what hasn't moved yet.

1904 2018-10-03 12:05:50 *Bob Farrell's 10 market rules to remember*

1. Markets tend to return to the mean over time

When stocks go too far in one direction, they come back. Euphoria and pessimism can cloud people’s heads. It’s easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment and lose perspective.

1983 2018-10-03 11:34:26 Again, this is about making people aware of a sham PR move by Bezos. Amazon changed their min. pay to $15 while also taking away bonuses and stocks from employees. More employees will be taking home less now.  Bezos is scum and does not deserve praise.
1984 2018-10-03 11:34:16 So you’re banning machine guns and bump stocks.
1985 2018-10-03 11:34:03 Holding losing stocks not only increases your losses, it stifles clarity (not to mention cash) to take advantage of new trade opportunities!
1986 2018-10-03 11:33:56 Could it just be a correction caused by the same stocks being dragged up by a record high market + it being the last few months of 2018?
Are these stocks predominantly from specific sectors?
1987 2018-10-03 11:33:38 Let the daily farce begin and make sure to buy those cheap dow stocks
1988 2018-10-03 11:33:22 Language is simple....hope u read the screenshot patiently.

It wud hv been a failure if it didn't held 138 however it did & bounced.

If bought in 3 parts thn the avg comes to around Rs 146+- & the stocks hits 162. 

Many r intelligent enough & knows how to bring down the cost.

1992 2018-10-03 11:32:04 How can Barnier negotiate seriously with either a 'dancing queen' or Boris de Pfeffel Johnson? David Cameron has allowed his party + this country to be hijacked by joke figures. The Tory Party + the UK are viewed internationally as laughing stocks in decline. So very sad...
1993 2018-10-03 11:32:01 does that make the value stocks more valuable or does the market love lamp?

1997 2018-10-03 11:31:19 Actually, America justly does not care a whit about bump stocks, since nobody heard of them before 1 year ago nor since, and they are irrelevant to public safety. 

But go on with the ritual teeth-gnashing.
1998 2018-10-03 11:30:08 Defence Industry and producers have now become laughing stocks!! Qualification is registration with MCA which cannot see 90000 crore worth scam of ILFS right under thenose!! That is the only qualification for getting 56000 crore submarine contract and 50000 croreRafale!! God SOS!
1999 2018-10-03 11:29:25 Bring back the stocks...
2000 2018-10-03 11:28:33 I wonder how much that would be now if he just docked it away in normal stocks. Surely it would be way over the amount he has now. Well, anything is more then bankrupt.
2001 2018-10-03 11:28:27 Can’t people do the same with a rubber band? Wouldn’t we need to ban rubber bands and all other elastic-like materials in order to get the effect we want from banning bump stocks?
2002 2018-10-03 11:28:09 As long as you have the GOP controlling Congress, they will never ban bump stocks. The NRA is worth too much to their re-election campaigns.
2003 2018-10-03 11:27:55 Dow closed yesterday at new high; however > 3x as many stocks hit 52w lows than 52w highs on NYSE...since 1965, it’s happened only one other time: December 28, 1999 @sentimentrader

2006 2018-10-03 11:25:41 Hi Tweeps! Watching UK Prime Minister Theresa May on TV - she's not a particularly inspiring speaker! Stocks look fairly much the same as yesterday but we'll have to see how the day pans out!
2007 2018-10-03 11:24:35 I can hear a few of them now, Mikel:  "Well... I never said he was the nicest person the world... but the stock market's at its highest point in history!"

The irony is, many people saying that don't have any or many stocks.  That's not his main demographic.

2014 2018-10-03 11:21:24 Hey folks, heard about amazon's raising of their "minimum" wage to $15/hr?  Awesome news right?  Yea, they did it by taking productivity bonuses, and non-vested stocks away from their workers.  This might be great for NEW workers, but it equates to a CUT for long-time workers.
2015 2018-10-03 11:20:07 Hello and welcome to  BBC. This is  grekko with the latest business news. The Neutrals are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  CAJ stocks. Thank you for tuning into  BBC.

2019 2018-10-03 11:16:46 You’re not accounting for the monthly VCP bonuses, which in my case, was a couple thousand in total last year. Also current employees no longer will receive stocks after 2020... we’ll instead be given an option to BUY into them. It’s a pay cut, period.
2020 2018-10-03 11:16:12 STOP feeling ‘sorry’ for this worthless POS!  She’s single handedly DESTROYING an Honorable MAN, his Distinguished career, and a Humble, Godly FAMILY!

2022 2018-10-03 11:14:34 If a business made shares of stocks & bonds and those shares also collapsed later then your talking about nothing cause remember Trump had to borrow from his father unearned income $1 million so that is certain ludicrous to think the value was even there to begin with of anything

2026 2018-10-03 11:12:27 Which part don’t you get, the steady increase in the gdp and stocks, over 90+ months, the four quarters  of growth greater than Trumps by far or the  job increase? It is not rocket science.

2031 2018-10-03 11:09:36 You're really not up on the news, are you?
Legislation is almost complete on getting rid of bump stocks. 
Unfortunately, it's not an overnight problem solve.
2032 2018-10-03 11:09:02 That's interesting. Technically both stocks are holding above their 200-day moving averages while Nifty Midcap had breached that level long back. Probably a sign that smart money is not yet ready to book profits and move out of the stock. All the best :)

3) Stocks + Annuities

2056 2018-10-03 10:52:47 'Historic tax cuts' that somebody else will have to pay for down the line; 'Destroyed ISIS' that is still alive and kicking; and the 'Stock Market Boom' that is entirely down to half a dozen tech stocks pushed by stock buy backs and low interest rates, not Trump. Bad analogy.
2057 2018-10-03 10:52:05 During this DOW run when've I looked at the components 99% were green so it was broad.

2076 2018-10-03 10:42:21 Losing the bonuses and stocks really sucks. But if you got $1/hr raise, that’s 40/wk, $2080/yr, or $4160 in 2 years (time it takes stock to vest) which is more than double what stock is worth.

2084 2018-10-03 10:35:29 Is it just me or are we seeing many bargains of high quality stocks in the markets lately that we don’t have enough money to buy them all? 
2085 2018-10-03 10:34:37 As a current Amazon employee, BNA2 Nashville, we were told last night we would be losing our monthly VCP bonuses and our stocks.  Thanks Amazon for the raise that's not really a raise. Some employee's have to go down in pay if they were over $15 due to Length of service.
2086 2018-10-03 10:34:14 That is because the closing price of stocks is always adjusted for average of the rate traded in the last half hour. Don't focus on closing, the live action said it all!

2090 2018-10-03 10:32:27 It sickens me to think that those bump-stocks were still readily available after the one year anniversary of the #LasVegas shooting! But what bothers me even more is that the news outlets barely had time for it. Why? After the Boston Marathon bombing, it's all we're heard about!
2091 2018-10-03 10:31:27 Why all stocks collapsed suddenly specially banks ?

2114 2018-10-03 10:08:17 If you have access to stocks of tires, you can rot them by spilling oil, gasoline, caustic acid, or benzine on them. Synthetic rubber, however, is less susceptible to these chemicals.

2147 2018-10-03 09:47:05 The part they don't announce is that all new associates after November 1st now don't get stocks or VCP which is a a building performance and attendance bonus once a month. So basically it's a cash front instead of giving it as a bonus at months end.
2148 2018-10-03 09:45:44 The saying “3 out of 4 stocks follow the market” is good enough for me. I don’t have a watchlist for vanadium stocks but not hard to compile. There’s always the 1 outlier to what overall markets are doing. $AVL has been the most pumped #Vanadium play. I’m sure the rest are great!
2149 2018-10-03 09:44:49 Many stocks are at low. Go long on them and then do intraday short on them to cover for market intraday volatility.

2223 2018-10-03 08:49:17 European stocks climbed alongside the $EUR and Italian #bonds rallied on reports the government will rein in spending plans! Asian stocks dropped as #investors weighed continuing concerns in #Indonesia and India and strength in commodity prices!

2227 2018-10-03 08:46:11 Not scepticism, I’m glad to see stocks rising! And I’m fully on board with scientists working with fishermen, hence my work with @Ajax_Hake. I never was a fisherman and never will be, but I do try to avoid ‘one-upmanship’ via twitter - it’s better if we ALL work together

2268 2018-10-03 07:52:54 I think it scares SM to think that one day, without the help of exols, that their overall stocks will not be as high as they once were. This is not to imply that EXO is the only breadwinner here, but to say that EXO plays a big role in revenue. 

Just a thought ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2274 2018-10-03 07:43:49 Thatcher had no say on CFP we was stitched up long before that by Heath and to be honest don’t think anyone knew back then the full impact the CFP on U.K. fishers or our fishing grounds and our fish stocks!

2276 2018-10-03 07:43:16 How can one be so negatively focused, full time, on others "loss and failure"? Also don't understand why "smart" people like Mark would short-sell stocks which are doing progressively good every month.Try create your own company, try make profits instead playing Russian-roulette!

2369 2018-10-03 06:19:45 The idea is wages only rise when unemployment rate is low. By increasing profits you are giving people incentive to invest. Profits will go into new stocks. Total jobs increase. Total wages go up. Like today Amazon announced increasing minimum wages to $15 per hour. Why nt invest

2476 2018-10-03 05:00:55 Hmm so ibig ba sabihin hihintayin muna makapagsecure ng stocks para sa lahat ng umorder bago makuha yung order? Even if nagbayad as soon as possible para makapagsecure agad ng order? Sorry if I'm asking this pero Oct na and this is still the update for the army bomb.

2478 2018-10-03 04:59:34 Cigar stocks just went up.
2479 2018-10-03 04:59:16 Red will draw stocks red, lead to crisis, recession, depression even.

Bailing out the investors, banks from free market economy may cost it all, sink US, EU, Russia.

2487 2018-10-03 04:54:36 Is it considered copycating if I found stocks and have a piece in the works? Similar to some posted
2488 2018-10-03 04:54:23 so my stocks were disappointing today
2489 2018-10-03 04:52:35 It still shows that 60% of American families are benefiting from the appreciation of stock prices. You don't have to own a large percentage of the stocks for it to have a positive effect on your finances. I know I've benefited from it and I am not rich at all.

2511 2018-10-03 04:39:53 @realDonaldTrump, just watched the Blasey clip from your Mississippi rally again. I'd like to see you in the stocks (as in Colonial times) facing a crowd of sexual abuse survivors. You really are a piece of crap.
2512 2018-10-03 04:39:35 You always make more money in a falling market than a rising one. Fear is a stronger emotion than greed. #trading #stocks #nifty #tradingpsychology
2513 2018-10-03 04:38:38 CEO's salary is a small part of what they make. For example, Bezos makes approx 1.6 million - about $3.00 for each person he employs. Sounds fair, right. But he made 40 million in company stocks. His employees would be better off with company stock than raises.
2514 2018-10-03 04:37:46 Though #Sensex & #Nifty is down, some earlier battered down stocks are up today - eg #YesBank (8%), ILFS Eng (20%), ILFS Passport (20%), #ILFS Inv Managers (10%), etc.

2517 2018-10-03 04:35:31 It’s been one year since #LasVegas and has Trump passed a ban on bump stocks? Has he supported any gun control legislation? Has Trump even said any words to mark the anniversary of the worst mass shooting in US history? 
No, instead he mocked a sexual assault survivor. Repugnant.

2521 2018-10-03 04:32:24 Male bump stocks federally illegal. That would help
2522 2018-10-03 04:32:20 Won't pass any laws related to gun violence (he lied yesterday and said you just can't ban bump stocks as it requires hearings) so instead of addressing the issue he is giving money to help identify problems before a weapon comes into the school. IT IS EASY ACCESS TO ALL THE GUNS
2523 2018-10-03 04:31:01 So you’re just blind or deaf to this?  And yea, great the stock market is high.  Let’s hope you own (the right) stocks.
2524 2018-10-03 04:30:56 That sucks! Nothing will ever replace discretionary trading! Nothing will ever beat 1,000 pairs of eyes such as #HotCopper mob or the #Twitter Gang alerting & bringing stocks to our radar. Only purpose of social media IMO!

2535 2018-10-03 04:24:19 No federal legislation has been passed, but Florida and a handful of other states have passed laws banning bump stocks. It's not the greatest accomplishment ever but it's better than nothing
2536 2018-10-03 04:22:22 reminds me of how my dad just got more and more awful as he got richer, til he died. dude had a pile of money, stocks, etc, but he just got obsessed w/more and more. there was no level of security where he felt safe. secluded himself in the house in an all-white area

2539 2018-10-03 04:21:20 We were only communicating that 66.9% of global fish stocks are responsibly fished&healthy. This should be recognised by the international community, including NGOs.

2549 2018-10-03 04:18:30 Keep your canon. It take 5 minutes to reload. On the anniversary of the Las Vegas mass shooting, we should finally do something about bump stocks.
2550 2018-10-03 04:16:45 They banned bump stocks which is the device that allowed the rifle to be fired at a full auto like rate

As for Lithium during a GFC the blue chip stocks definitely will be effected as insto tend to hold them

2588 2018-10-03 03:49:33 Did you ban assault rifles, bump-stocks, high capacity magazines, and universal background checks? That is sensible gun safety. We don’t want our teachers carrying weapons that might get our children killed and themselves. No weapons to mentally ill and domestic violence abusers.

2601 2018-10-03 03:40:41 HMMM TicTail and Etsy stores will close for a couple of days so I can update my inventory! Just remembered I had some sold out stocks and I want to fix it before any unnecessary orders come around.

It'll be back up by Oct. 4, 2018; 03:00am; GMT+8
2602 2018-10-03 03:40:15 That jerk hasn’t even outlawed bump stocks yet!! And he still has people that believe in him. How stupid can they be! If the truth does not sound right to him he just lies! Do you get it yet?????
2603 2018-10-03 03:40:14 Then enact some gun controls like universal background checks, mental health ban bump stocks.
2604 2018-10-03 03:39:40 Stop asking me to teach u stocks cho ass on YouTube like I did and read a few books

2606 2018-10-03 03:38:31 Did you forget about bump stocks?
2607 2018-10-03 03:37:34 Amazon's raise is bullshit. It's a PR stunt. By raising the wage and taking away stocks and VCP, they're saving money.
2608 2018-10-03 03:35:46 You won't see me play with options much beyond using Puts once in a while. I see them as risky as I see shorting. Stocks don't expire, and I am not bound by arbitrary deadlines. Further, Options are not protected by fiduciary duty, since they're side contracts.
2609 2018-10-03 03:34:14 OS - How does one determine the relationship (pos. or neg.) between overnight or early-morning $nq_f and the expected price direction of individual NASD stocks/options?  Thank you, as always, for your incredible insight!
2610 2018-10-03 03:31:50 With the approval of LNG Canada today its time to start accumulating core positions in nat gas stocks on weakness. A new cycle starts soon and the long game will pay off here in my opinion $CR $ARX $PONY $BNP $BIR $LXE $TOU $CQE $VII $AAV
2611 2018-10-03 03:30:56 My Uber driver, a stock broker who drives to “destress” and talk to random people, just gave me a 30 minute course on which marijuana stocks to invest in. #2018inSF
2612 2018-10-03 03:30:15 ABC Radio agreed to display in stocks, outside Ultimo, anyone who said Big Dxxxx.

I think this is fair policy.

2614 2018-10-03 03:29:32 Uhhhh so @Amazon increased the wage for the workers at my partner's warehouse but got rid of the non-OT bonuses (stocks and monthly productivity/attendance) which means MANY people technically got a pay cut for this PR stunt
2615 2018-10-03 03:29:16 Anybody looking at its canadian stocks will rapidly know what to make of your « great » warrior. Go on! Take a look! Numbers don’t lie, medias such as yours do it allllll the time.
2616 2018-10-03 03:29:07 Shit the day I have my career I’m beginning with investing in stocks & fuck it up aver que sale
2617 2018-10-03 03:28:48 That assumes the stocks have no limitations, which I do not know if they do.  Be odd that they would give them up if they dont.  I had a friend with stock options and she could only sell them when she left or had a certain number she could sell back to the company only.
2618 2018-10-03 03:27:50 Let’s just buy stocks

2623 2018-10-03 03:23:24 Bump stocks were used by the Vegas shooter. They probably harmed his body count, though, as they reduced accuracy. What *helped* was 2 sniper perches, with a corralled crowd below. And when did you determine his political affiliation?
2624 2018-10-03 03:23:21 Some stocks have been in decline for two or three years. When do you expect this to bottom out?
2625 2018-10-03 03:22:54 Too bad they do not tell everyone they are taking away monthly bonuses, the 2000 dollars in stocks they have yearly. And that the cap after 3 years is only 15.55 and hour.
2626 2018-10-03 03:21:45 IMO the 2nd Amendment can be respected & people can still own guns. The NRA opposes every.single.measure for gun control. Common sense things like raising the age to purchase from 18 to 21 or banning assault weapons & bump stocks. Most people don’t want to outlaw all weapons.
2627 2018-10-03 03:21:38 Today has been a day full of bad vibes  but on the bright side, I registered my stocks 
2628 2018-10-03 03:20:18 The Indian market remains in a Downtrend. On Monday, FIIs were net sellers as they dumped stocks worth Rs 1,841.63 crore. DIIs were net buyers as they purchased stocks worth Rs 1,804.94 crore.
2629 2018-10-03 03:19:09 Yep, no more vcp and stocks..
2630 2018-10-03 03:18:32 Lol but it’s true, but look at the stocks look the amount those companies bring in in profit after labor and all is cut out. Billions still
2631 2018-10-03 03:17:22 You will still stick to your non performing stocks coz u feel one day they will get you good returns

How's Nike looking now in both stocks & sales? In your own words, "how dumb are u"
2634 2018-10-03 03:15:25 Yeah and you are letting them infringe on our 2nd amendment rights by banning bump stocks.

2638 2018-10-03 03:13:22 Then why can I still buy bump-stocks?
2639 2018-10-03 03:13:18 But you are taking away stocks and VCP from you associates that have been there to pay for this. Thanks for nothing Jeff!

2642 2018-10-03 03:12:09 It’s not bad! I did it in the background while I was working from home today. And it makes a lot. Prob 2/3 of a gallon that you can drink straight up, make soup/gravies with, etc.

I’ve been saving bones for a year - I have a lot of stocks coming my way!
2643 2018-10-03 03:11:56 I am buying stocks with some reservations, the stock prices just doesn’t add up.
2644 2018-10-03 03:11:46 How many new lows are foreign stocks and closed end funds?
2645 2018-10-03 03:11:05 TOXIC TRUMP SAYS HE IS COMMITTED TO KEEPING SCHOOL CHILDREN SAFE, WON'T EVEN OUTLAW BUTT STOCKS ON SEMI AUTO RIFLES THAT LET THEM FIRE IN AUTO MODE.. IS THERE ANYTHING HE DOESN'T LIE ABOUT. AS LONG AS THE " MAGACREEPS " KEEP GOING TO HIS CIRCUS RALLIES. ..HE'LL KEEP ON LYING 
2646 2018-10-03 03:10:43 Catching the bottom of any stock in a correction phase is next to impossible. If you like a stock for the long term, then start buying it in parts. Split your targeted investment into say 5 parts and start buying in phases. The upside move in some stocks can be very sharp.
2647 2018-10-03 03:10:37 What about bump stocks?? It’s been one year since Vegas and still no federal regulations 
2648 2018-10-03 03:10:19 Sage advice. But no one can predict the bottom. Greed works in both directions. When stocks go up no one wants to sell.. When stocks go down no one wants to buy coz of greed that they might get it still cheaper

2652 2018-10-03 03:09:25 Well bump stocks are all but gone. So your wrong.
2653 2018-10-03 03:08:27 right you are. 

to bathe Trump, Pence, Kavanaugh, Graham, Grassley, McConnell, Ryan, Sanders, and their ilk in shame is my aim.  that's what SHAME ON YOU!Tube is all about.  some folks deserve the stocks and pillories, and the censure of the Commonweal.

2656 2018-10-03 03:06:39 It will be determined pre-market tomorrow. But they sure as hell disturbed my portfolio by a single tweet. Down 5% on all weed stocks. MNGA held up with straight gains.
2657 2018-10-03 03:06:14 You haven’t even banned bump stocks.
2658 2018-10-03 03:05:27 Top priority for Sandy Hook is reasonable gun control. You couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks like you promised.
2659 2018-10-03 03:04:43 I still have stocks besh.  pero its my personal stock na. Gagamitin ko nalang muna yun 
2660 2018-10-03 03:03:44 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks ended an up-and-down session mostly lower as Amazon’s wage increase pressured retailers and small caps slumped to a two-month low as trade tensions eased.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries was at 3.06 percent.
2661 2018-10-03 03:03:00 You promised to ban bump stocks and you did not do it.  Stop lying.
2662 2018-10-03 03:02:07 top 1% pay 40% of the taxes but hold 80% of the wealth, most jobs are either corporations or small businesses.small business owners are not in the 1% generally, my problem is my overall rate i pay is 25%, but the rich pay 15%, they do stocks, all money should be treated the same
2663 2018-10-03 03:01:58 Translation....buy insurance stocks.
2664 2018-10-03 03:01:35 Now that they added the pay raise they are eliminating monthly bonuses and the yearly gift of stocks. So workers are actually making less money.
2665 2018-10-03 03:01:07 sp500 is the strategy of holding (close to) the 500 largest US stocks.  in that sense it can serve as a benchmark for other (long-only) strategies. said another way, any long only stocks strategy can be compared against (risk adjusted) owning vanguard sp500 index (5bp fee)

2670 2018-10-03 02:58:08 Interesting question ! I have no idea, but check out Ray Merriman at MMA cycles, he's one of the the top financial astrologers in the world, esp for stocks and commodities. I'm trying to be the top Crypto astrologer in the world !
2671 2018-10-03 02:57:03 And yet, bump stocks are still legal. 
2672 2018-10-03 02:56:58 
No stocks left anymore? HAHAHA How will you commish now?! 
2673 2018-10-03 02:56:53 I See 10 or 20 tweets from whom I follow or who follows Me ??? Twitter is a Fixed Game ... Not one of my Stocks I would Never Play Cards With ??? Twitter Cheats All
2674 2018-10-03 02:56:34 Then we can watch our taxes go up along with unemployment and watch our military get decimated and we can watch our stocks plummet.
2675 2018-10-03 02:56:22 You're very kind! Love teaching folks about the markets and stocks. I'm well aware the market is always right and I just have to get in line with it!
2676 2018-10-03 02:56:03 Then ban bump stocks and assault weapons. You are encouraging violence and hatred and racism whenever you speak. Wherever you go. You are aiding Putin destroy American democracy.
2677 2018-10-03 02:55:50 Agree.  I only have 5K rounds.  1 shot, one kill.  Not looking forward to this but will defend by all means necessary, if threatened.  Only if threatened. Agree.  bump stocks are useless.
2678 2018-10-03 02:55:48 @thinkervenu stocks for 1 month hold duration any  suggestion?
2679 2018-10-03 02:54:39 School safety grants are not going to assist saving anyone.  It will give them false hope and sadly another person will walk into a school and kill innocent children.  BAN THE HIGH CAPACITY WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS AND HAVE BETTER BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. imbecile!
2680 2018-10-03 02:53:53 Also, no one sells good stocks unless you know where to look! Google "buy tickling stocks" and the results are so sad lol
2681 2018-10-03 02:52:52 If your for safety for children in act gun control you dick head stop bump stocks you're a fool
2682 2018-10-03 02:52:00 How are we doing with those bump stocks mr president?
2683 2018-10-03 02:51:26 You know bump stocks are pretty unreliable just a fast way to fire off an amount of bullets? And you never answered my question
2684 2018-10-03 02:51:24 That will change on its own. You must not invest in stocks James. Any %return gain can be more than eliminated by the same or less of a % loss.
2685 2018-10-03 02:50:12 The snap chat stocks are always down
2686 2018-10-03 02:50:08 WTF!  Are you not aware that Republicans hold the majority in both houses of Congress?   NOTHING would stop legislation from being passed.  The NRA doesn't want Republicans to give an inch even on something as inconsequential from a gun-owning standpoint as bump stocks.
2687 2018-10-03 02:49:33 Lets not forget the expanded anti-semitism law and dept of ed anti-semitism actions. And for good measure there is a bill to grant minority status to "fellow whites"..  Trump is working as hard as he can for Bibi.  And banning bump stocks if not more.  Winning oppression.
2688 2018-10-03 02:48:50 Lemme check out those toys r us stocks

2690 2018-10-03 02:47:48 Here is @CreditSuisse' @neelkanthmishra's #equitycall this morning, advises avoiding stocks where high multiples imply high assumed growth rate
2691 2018-10-03 02:47:28 Absolutely.  Morningstar started out as a mutual fund company which is why their focus is on mutual funds.  Motley Fool was always stocks.  Both are great values which is why I subscribe to both.
2692 2018-10-03 02:47:25 HAHA ily
2693 2018-10-03 02:47:09 Recent correction in the growth stocks offers a chance of participation, Morgan Stanley's @rndx1 says
2694 2018-10-03 02:47:07 I’m almost positive that the guys at my corner store know when I’m on my period because this bitch stocks up on snickers and red wine.
2695 2018-10-03 02:46:25 Yet bump stocks remain legal.

Tells you all you need to know about how much Benedict Donald, republiSCUM or the @NRA care about the children in America!
2696 2018-10-03 02:46:24 Stocks are lit!
2697 2018-10-03 02:45:36 They are talking about banning bump stocks. Hahahahahahaha I can make one with my shoestring and my belt loop. Not that I would they're freakin useless. I like the idea of 1 shot 1 kill. I like to conserve.
2698 2018-10-03 02:45:26 I rly dnt like when designers be using bare stocks n sheet lul
2699 2018-10-03 02:44:51 My gut says that big Ag and major food providers have a hand in this as well. Example:  If the CEO of a major fast-food chain is heavily invested in healthcare stocks how would that influence his or her decisions at work in regard to food quality?
2700 2018-10-03 02:42:19 Something to think about....I can see it being a useful indicator for cyclical stocks. Thanks.
2701 2018-10-03 02:42:19 Crypto, Stocks, Real Estate. Look at our DM’s, you know I’m business minded :)
2702 2018-10-03 02:41:51 Maddening. What’s worse is I think they really believe in what they say. I’m dumping my money into straitjacket stocks. POTUS really has pushed libs over the edge.
2703 2018-10-03 02:41:11 For all my seafood eating friends just remember that there a people on remote islands who free dive 30ft looking for fish to eat to and  cannot find any  & are starving because 1st world fishing habits have ruined fish stocks world wide.
2704 2018-10-03 02:41:00 @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 Did you see that MD is banning bump stocks and ‘rapid fire trigger activators?’
2705 2018-10-03 02:40:36 Another lie! We are the laughing stocks of the world.The world is turning to other world leaders like Germany, Russia and China. The American president is LAST on the list.
2706 2018-10-03 02:40:34 Seller remorse- seen it, have had it, still have it from time to time but make the best decision you can and ...

2707 2018-10-03 02:40:33 Every sector/ firm  has some characteristics . If you can track how much % the stock fell in last two bear market - it gives you an broad idea how much it can fall  assuming structurally things have not changed - Works well for Top FMCG/ cyclical stocks ..
2708 2018-10-03 02:39:17 @business @markets #Asia @YvonneManTV & @DavidInglesTV : Tell #JemmyPaul that when retail investors starts looking at Penny stocks, it means that value stocks are priced out of reach!!!

2714 2018-10-03 02:36:31 Really? Bump stocks are still available and and 100% background checks still don't exist.
2715 2018-10-03 02:35:51 So does that outlaw high cap mags, bump stocks & similar? How about improved background checks for assault style rifles and banning the sale of firearms to those with mental health issues??
2716 2018-10-03 02:35:27 "We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead." Did you really have to think THAT hard to take away our VCP and stocks, therefore LOWERING our pay, @JeffBezos?
2717 2018-10-03 02:33:54 But we lost our stocks and vcp bonuses for a dollar more?
2718 2018-10-03 02:33:19 DOH claims that there is no ARV shortage.

But why are we still having ARV issues in most hubs?

Obviously, there is a disconnect and it’s a Region to Clinic/Hub distribution issue.

It’s not enough to say that there are stocks available.

DOH should ensure TIMELY DISTRIBUTION.

2725 2018-10-03 02:29:55 Hey @krassenstein if you would listen, and read. bump stocks will be banned in 2 to 3 weeks. Have to go threw the process to ban them.  You do know we have laws, and a process we must follow, right?
2726 2018-10-03 02:29:05 Kevin, good points. Stocks "talk." We just have to "listen" with an open mind. As you point out.
2727 2018-10-03 02:28:39 Propaganda bump stocks are still on the market and you have done your normal nothing. Any improvements has been done on a local level.

2729 2018-10-03 02:28:05 @RepAdamSchiff I'm sure you will introduce a bill in the house tomorrow to outlaw Bump Stocks. Remember ,actions speak louder then words. I'm looking forward to reading it in the news. President Trump has indicated he will support such legislation.
2730 2018-10-03 02:27:33 @SenSanders thanks for the socialist distribution of our money at Amazon. Thanks to you, we just lost our stocks and monthly bonuses for “fairness”. I’m putting this out for everyone to see. I want America to know you screwed us
2731 2018-10-03 02:27:24 George Soros, I pray your stocks go down, down and down so you can go bankruptcy and don’t pay liberals. God will punish you for favoring abortion!
2732 2018-10-03 02:27:10 @RobinhoodApp notes + research feature for stocks watching would be nice. I watch a lot forgetting why on some.
2733 2018-10-03 02:27:07 Then @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks now. That would be a real start.
2734 2018-10-03 02:26:52 “He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships.”

2737 2018-10-03 02:25:29 @FLOTUS Dear Mrs. Trump, thought you should know that the Amazon raise is coming at the cost of our monthly production bonuses and our stocks. The socialist have struck again. Thank you for the work you and Mr. Trump are doing
2738 2018-10-03 02:23:47 Liar. You didn't do anything about bump stocks. Or gun control. Nah...this doesn't pass the stink test. Lies.
2739 2018-10-03 02:23:18 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, thought you should know that the Amazon raise is coming at the cost of our monthly production bonuses and our stocks. The socialist have struck again
2740 2018-10-03 02:23:03 Obviously none of the other MJ stocks have issue with being inflated with high volume. Tilray, IGC to name a few. No company puts out statements like that, they aren’t doing anything wrong, haven’t misrepresented anything. They turn away speculative traders ? Dumb plan
2741 2018-10-03 02:23:00 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks ended an up-and-down session mostly lower as Amazon’s wage increase pressured retailers and small caps slumped to a two-month low as trade tensions eased.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries was at 3.06 percent.
2742 2018-10-03 02:22:56 Top 10% of households own 80% of all US stocks (this is taking into account 401k and pensions). Not saying it's inherently bad of course... But hard to argue that the "general public" is the main stockholder.
2743 2018-10-03 02:22:55 1(2) My <.02 mkt vu: record high by the DJ was met with broad selling in other indexes. Keep in mind folks that the DJ is price weighted vs mkt cap weighted in the others. Reason for the bifurcation. Also breadth showed neg divergence w fewer stocks participating.

2790 2018-10-03 01:54:42 This is no sacrifice. He took away our stocks and our bonuses. Amazon came out the winner, not the employees.
2791 2018-10-03 01:54:01 Democrats winning big in November is a potential downside risk for the market just because of the uncertainty that will follow. 

Another downside risk is the EU doing something stupid, especially if it undermines valuations of US tech stocks. 

What could break Amazon's stock?
2792 2018-10-03 01:52:46 so I wonder what he would have made had he invested half of that into stocks?
2793 2018-10-03 01:52:19 RSU stocks are gone. Incentive is gone, but still have metrics (as any job does.) Those of us who bust our a$$ WILL lose wages when this is said and done.

2801 2018-10-03 01:44:50 Yet NFL's ratings have gone up this year. I mean, that Chiefs vs Broncos game was great. But the WWE mindset is "Oh our stocks doing good, who cares?" so they'll continue to put out bad TV.

Still a lot of volume to work through assuming all those shares from last year want to sell at break even.
2815 2018-10-03 01:39:02 One of the worst ways to identify undervalued stocks is using the distance from the 52 week high. But it is also one of the easiest, and hence one of the most popular methods.

2824 2018-10-03 01:34:39 Those are valid points and why he should keep being pushed.  This is a win for those making less than 15 though and stocks are not that important to people making less than 15 bucks an hour.

2844 2018-10-03 01:24:09 Puedo estar de acuerdo parcialmente. Pero el caso es que los stocks pesqueros están muy sobrexplotados y de eso no hay duda. Especialmente cuando están en un ciclo bajo hay que protegerlos y controlar con rigor la actividad pesquera que puede darles el golpe de gracia. Ha pasado
2845 2018-10-03 01:23:48 Come out to @smokymtnspeed this Saturday for a doubleheader with @SASDIRT ($7,500 to win) and @DurrenceLayneLM ($4,000 to win) plus Kajun Mini Stocks.
2846 2018-10-03 01:23:45 I wonder if $APRN would actually go up if they did something like this. CBD infused food or whatever, because that stuff seems to be blowing up these stocks nowadays.
2847 2018-10-03 01:22:21 I like believing in conspiracies and the way the FDA rolls, I wouldn’t put it past them. MO and PM stocks have cratered last few months on significant sales drops. Vape is the future, this is their way of hitting the pause button so they don’t end up like blockbuster
2848 2018-10-03 01:21:55 Maybe you're a new follower but I look at more than 80 charts before I have my first morning coffee!

Put it this way, my average PEG list has about 150 stocks and I run thru this list at least 3 times a day. 

And this barely scratches the surface of what I do on an average day
2849 2018-10-03 01:21:30 A lot of Amazon employees have been talking about losing their stocks in the company due to the wage increase. Can you please look into this given how you're an outlet?
2850 2018-10-03 01:21:22 Many good companies are coming at very cheap prices and they are the best buy coming eight months, Don't go for penny stocks at this time
2851 2018-10-03 01:20:52 Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy or socialist theft.

Once you think of yourself as an OWNER of a business, u won't rush to enter & exit stocks at every twist & turn of the #nifty. 

Problem is, very few investors know what they truly own!
2854 2018-10-03 01:19:16 I agree, but what if u stuck in stocks like PCJ at higher price, and looking at the price declining daily, should we exit with loss or not?
2855 2018-10-03 01:16:57 yoah thats outdated processor! are they selling from old unreleased stocks!
2856 2018-10-03 01:15:55 A lot of good companies are coming at very cheap prices, don't go for penny stocks
2857 2018-10-03 01:15:14 Also Jeff did not mention that with this so called raise employees no longer receive stocks or the monthly bonuses that they once did.  Jeff does not care about his workers.
2858 2018-10-03 01:14:55 Every one of them should be in the stocks.

2870 2018-10-03 01:06:55 Bulls or bears these pot stocks are nuts lately.
2871 2018-10-03 01:06:42 Either stocks and/or bonds OR some nice clothes
2872 2018-10-03 01:06:31 Wages are stagnant and the rich only create jobs when there’s demand. Middle class creates demand and everyone prospers. Tax cuts for rich only buy back stocks and give CEOs raises. The tariffs and other trump mistakes hurt us too. R’s only help the morbidly rich.
2873 2018-10-03 01:06:30 when all y’all get cancer from that juul shit, best believe i’m buying stocks in mesothelioma advertising
2874 2018-10-03 01:05:32 And I'm sure the low rent "forgotten men and women of america" with their less than 500 bucks in equity, are loving the fact that their non-existant 401ks are booming.  They don't own stocks, they don't own anything, they're all debtors.
2875 2018-10-03 01:05:08 Sad that might be your condition but I just got me a big dividend check from my stocks sad no I don't think that's the word
2876 2018-10-03 01:04:39 About the only ounce of respect he will get from me is if he actually does away with bump stocks.
2877 2018-10-03 01:04:33 PP is still fully funded, funding approved for research based on baby body parts, debt is high, tariffs...  Trump signed the bills, Cruz voted for atleast one.   Now Trump says he wants to regulate bump stocks.  You support all of the above and I am a liberal.

2879 2018-10-03 01:02:23 Can the trump movement suggest to trump to not ban bump stocks? We can’t cave to the left and let them drive the narrative. We need to be loosening gun laws not making new ones
2880 2018-10-03 01:02:00 @TuckerCarlson the alleged raise isn’t what is seems. They took our monthly bonus and our stocks Also those who have been with the company for several years will be making the same as a fresh face off the street! Unfair :(
2881 2018-10-03 01:01:06 We need to plan like professors  to invest in stocks
2882 2018-10-03 01:00:00 Just wanted to put it out there for you guys who invest in stocks and what not, me and my buddy realized they’re going to drop 6 major titles this coming season. If you have the cash, buy a couple shares. You’ll make profit for sure.
2883 2018-10-03 00:59:13 If it moves towards the valuation of other profitable #gold stocks. Yes $1.50 - $2 should be reached in next 2 yrs.
2884 2018-10-03 00:58:15 It is becoming clearer by the day that except for corporates and political leaders, everybody else seems to be in need of humanitarian aid sometime or the other. Buffer stocks of resources would need to be kept in readiness at short notice in a routine fashion for emergencies.

2892 2018-10-03 00:52:59 Amazon really said “hey let’s pay them $15/hr but let’s take away their monthly bonuses and their stocks” :)))))))) so basically all fc workers are getting is an extra $50 a month
2893 2018-10-03 00:52:15 Suspect the market is scared and overly cautious to participate after being hurt or witnessing the vicious retreat in Lithium and Cobalt stocks.

2902 2018-10-03 00:42:26 No offense but there probably aren’t 100 mini-stocks in the states of NC, SC and GA combined much less that many that will travel. There are 100 sport compacts at this race every year and they put on a fantastic show.

2914 2018-10-03 00:36:09 Just so everyone knows that amazon minimum wage raise is bullshit because they’re taking away stocks and monthly bonuses from employees so they’ll actually be making less.
2915 2018-10-03 00:35:12 @maddow Rachel u r great finding nugget in articles. Nytimes article talked about stock manipulation & greenmailing. Leopards don’t change spots! Trump singles out companies & attacks drive stocks down. As a tax professional, I would say up to old tricks @sec needs to investigate
2916 2018-10-03 00:35:02 100% ETFs and stock mutual funds.  No bonds:  return is too low.  Funds are about 85% American, 10% Euro, and 5% Asian.  Largest holding is in Contrafund.  With lifespans going to 100 or more, I need to double inflation until I die, so stocks rule for me.  Real estate: lawyers

2929 2018-10-03 00:28:28 And yet, if you go back far enough, there were the Winters of 99 and 08 where tech and financial stocks ran off cliffs and lost anywhere from 50 to 90% of their value. We've had 10 years of a bull market and now everyone's a flipping genius investor. This too shall pass.

2948 2018-10-03 00:18:16 I think bump stocks’ big moment in the sun was when someone used them to shoot about 500 people in 10 minutes
2949 2018-10-03 00:17:51 Following Stocks lead the Dow Industrial

2950 2018-10-03 00:16:51 Not entirely accurate. They took away bonuses that were only given if am entire warehouse met rate. My husband will earn 400 more a month than he did when bonuses were around. They only took away anniversary stocks. Employees will still get stocks. Overtime was not taken away.

2960 2018-10-03 00:11:35 Looking thru stocks when I saw Apple market cap..
Apple is the world's first trillion-dollar company.  $230 per share
Made me look to see who else is or close. Alphabet mark cap 840B 1,200 per share & they have two Goog, GoogL each is $1,200+ per share.
2961 2018-10-03 00:10:41 I get your point.   The biggest gains are made over 20-30 years of holding compounding big winners.   Picking long term winners (and then holding those winning stocks) makes retirement doable.

2973 2018-10-03 00:03:27 Honestly we wouldn’t have gotten stocks for like more than another year plusss vcp is always low anyways except around oct,nov, and December so I think it’s way more benefiting tbh 
2974 2018-10-03 00:03:18 My stocks are doing great and I dont even know what Im doing 
2975 2018-10-03 00:02:59 And they even indirectly threatened Trumps tweets saying they're exploring what to do about high profile tweeters. That he's not an exception. Go for it, Twitter. Ban the President. See how that works for your stocks.
2976 2018-10-03 00:02:54 Or, is it because you’re a Republican and all Republicans are good people and all people in the “Democrat” Party are evil heathens?  Or is it because he’ll end abortion or protect bump stocks in a just Federalist Society manner?  See, you don’t KNOW he’s a good man.
2977 2018-10-03 00:02:31 What's up with small-company stocks? After leading blue chips for much of this year, they're now lagging. Russell 2000 index -4.9% from record high. YTD +7.8%, trailing S&P 500 gain of +9.3% and Dow +8.3%. Small companies have benefited from Trump #MAGA focus. Why the fade now?
2978 2018-10-03 00:02:12 @CNN @ChrisCuomo @smerconish @JeffBezos Amazon raised us to $15 but They took away our stocks, our bonuses ,the raise we received 2 weeks ago Tenured employees went $15.65 
New hires will not receive annual increases, their first raise will be after 3 years.

2981 2018-10-03 00:01:55 I love FANG stocks but other than $AAPL, none are showing any strength to speak of.  Less upward participation, very narrow leadership=Defense!! Don't be all in on margin!  LOL   :)
2982 2018-10-03 00:01:48 I heard they are taking away our VCP and stocks
2983 2018-10-03 00:01:41 This move has hurt us profoundly. The annual hit of 4 to 6 thousand yearly due to loss of vcp and stocks. Now I'm hearing holiday bonuses as well?
This was supposed to help us.
It crippled us. We didn't want this. We don't  deserve this.
2984 2018-10-03 00:00:56 October stocks......
2985 2018-10-03 00:00:35  Dow Industrial hit high as U.S stocks climb as uncertainty weighs on elsewhere
