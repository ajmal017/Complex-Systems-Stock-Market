34 2018-08-21 23:40:35 @TDAmeritrade Hello, I am a client and I'm wondering why my account shows different values for various stocks than other sites after the market closes. For example, on 8/21/18 AMZN closed at 1883.42 (.38%).  However my TDA it is currently at 1871.00! Why is it lower in my account
35 2018-08-21 23:40:29 If our safety is important, why not implement steps to protect citizens from gun violence? Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, universal background checks. #livesoverguns
36 2018-08-21 23:40:08 The intraday loss hit 19.8%. But the real story is that > 50% of all stocks had losses of >40%. 2011 was a brutal bear market, far worse than most 20% corrections. The rest is semantics.

40 2018-08-21 23:38:52 @ChrisDanielShow  I love folkahontas’ idea even though from her it wiffs of central planning.    My amendment would be to mAke all stocks of US origin.  And a 1/3 of the portfolio needs to be staked to the dollar
41 2018-08-21 23:38:51 No email alerts. No trade alerts. I just talk about my trades which can real time trades. But this is different than other chatroom alerts where they plan and pump. I do this for stocks that heavily traded and never a room pump and dump. Watchlist posted pre market.
42 2018-08-21 23:38:45 Bios up tomorrow. Anti Pence stocks down...
43 2018-08-21 23:38:29 I don't know what is holding most stocks down ???? Summer would be my guess . Fall is around the corner . Just a hurry up and wait game imho 
44 2018-08-21 23:37:43 They will all be able to participate in $TSLAQ if their retirement account allows them to purchase pink sheet stocks.  And I’m sure many of them will.  $TSLA 
45 2018-08-21 23:36:33 Stocks indices after hours lower, and $NDX $NQ under $7380’s is concerning. $7350’s a support zone being tested now. Again, stocks can still make this a pullback, but keep an eye whether $NDX $NQ stays above the $7300-$7320 area.
46 2018-08-21 23:36:04 Dow is at 25,822.29 still 2.98% below its top reached Jan 26 at 26,616.71.  The S&P 500 today closed at 2882.96 and broke through its top of 2872.97.  We are entering a more risk period and stocks are looking a bit frothy again.  CNN money fear index is at greed.

50 2018-08-21 23:34:07 I’m a veteran.None of the weapons we used in the Army are anything like the AR-15. No mil unit uses it,armory stocks it,& it would be absolutely combat ineffective.Just bc it looks “scary” to self-proclaimed activists w insufficient firearms knowledge doesn’t change these facts.

52 2018-08-21 23:32:51 Bull market in US stocks is about to become the longest in history. If stocks don't drop significantly by the close of trading tonight, the bull market that began in Mar09 will have lasted nine years, five months and 13 days. Far from the 50% plunge during the financial crisis
53 2018-08-21 23:32:07 Getting into that next after I get these stocks and crypto down well.
54 2018-08-21 23:31:28 Don’t be fooled. The people who own the stocks and reap the profits from the electric car companies and solar panel makers are the same ones who own the coal mines and oil wells. The appearance that these industries are actively at odds is simply theatre.

60 2018-08-21 23:27:10 SPX by going over 2872.87, completes the structure technically, It means it may be starting a deep correction. Breaking 2802.49 will confirm that.
Will book profits on MU and few other long stocks in extended hours to be on safe side.
61 2018-08-21 23:26:51 Hi Mark, I know the Russell has broken out, however I'm not seeing much strength in my stocks, am I missing something?
62 2018-08-21 23:26:32 Why do you know'about me?
Unknown me?
If I said what I really wanted to say or my simple observations, tissue stocks would go up.
Mirrors are a mother.
63 2018-08-21 23:26:07 Ordinarily agree but $sncr is money pit money loser.  This one big profits.  Enough funds who don’t have issue only OTC stocks vs that garbage co
64 2018-08-21 23:25:43 So you'd rather subsidize businesses. You'd rather pay extra in your taxes, so that they can get away with paying less than a living wage. You've got yours, so fuck anyone who isn't smart/healthy/educated/lucky enough. 

I see.
65 2018-08-21 23:25:36 Dear God. Thank you for providing us a chance to get realestate and stocks. I'm making money. In Jesus name amen.
66 2018-08-21 23:25:28 The problem will be for Spanish and Portuguese boats no longer able to over-fish in our waters st our expense. Fish prices in the UK will reduce, fish stocks improve and the U.K. fishing industry like farming will create hundreds of jobs and thrive again. Brexit good news.

70 2018-08-21 23:22:46 I advocate whenever I can for Native subsistence hunting. Whales are seen as off limits but for most stocks the hunts are sustainable and culturally very important.

72 2018-08-21 23:22:23 Of all the thousands of metres of fabric that spotlight stocks they don’t have 3 metres of plain white linen.
73 2018-08-21 23:22:02 Yeah I like the first one more because the 2nd one is just a few stocks and already made PNGs
74 2018-08-21 23:21:38 I am sorry to have to reiterate that this administration and this president are world-wide laughing stocks. Is nobody telling Trump that Putin is laughing at him behind his back? Trump is a classic bully. No class. No dignity. No charm. And no muscle to back up his threats.
75 2018-08-21 23:21:16 Minimum wage, as it was originally conceived in FDR's time, was ABSOLUTELY 100% intended to be a living wage. That was literally the whole point.

78 2018-08-21 23:19:00 They will both sit pretty in the coming gold rally. If I view Aben Resources at $6 by the end of the year. I can see both of these stocks being monters. Pacton could hit (depending on how many deals are made). 12-15or end of year all goes well in the 50's. Just an optimist I gues
79 2018-08-21 23:15:40 You're telling me. I post one meme about Marijuana stocks and my stream goes crazy. More likes than my last 10 posts combined.

Where did I go wrong in life
80 2018-08-21 23:14:32 You won't find many people defending politicians' 80% annual returns on stocks, or their amazingly great real estate deals.

91 2018-08-21 23:06:08 Oddly enough your priorities are in need of a mental check. No more illegal aliens. Did you know that the murderer of an Iowa girl was committed by an illegal alien named Christian Rivera because your party favors illegal immigration above legal citizens... CNN needs stocks 
92 2018-08-21 23:05:43 I believe your lines are a bit faulty.  I also tend not to chart mining stocks - doesn't always work out. I do look at charts of course and especially volume/share price.  PS diverted my money to ABN.V almost doubled and will be much higher by end of year.  Pacton to FOLLOW.

95 2018-08-21 23:02:20 It’s impossible for Stock Market to collapse while US Government (FEDS) keep pumping up failing stocks. It’s deliberate attempt to hide INFLATION, tell you it’s all fine while it’s not. They are attempting to get your last $ in stocks & not cryptos. Big crypto moves are coming

98 2018-08-21 22:59:59 @PeoplesMomentum Jeremy should be fighting BREXIT as hard as I am...……. it is already impoverishing the country by serial devaluation of the Pound and making us laughing stocks round the world.  retweet please if you agree

102 2018-08-21 22:55:58 I don't even OWN a lawnmower!
103 2018-08-21 22:55:14 S&P 500 due a Weekly Cycle Top.  I say it reverses soon, decent selloff, bears call for major Double Top and bear market.  But instead over next 16 weeks, we form the Handle of a large C&H pattern.  Bullish for 2019.  #stocks
104 2018-08-21 22:55:11 thanks dad. Always sucks selling stocks. want those dividends. Better than having cash sitting there for emergencies though.

This time it worked out well.
105 2018-08-21 22:52:37 No question valuations on lithium stocks were getting out of line. Multiples expanded beyond 15x EBITDA (most base metals trade sub 8x). But as valuations fall back to earth, opportunities are emerging and the shorting trade game for the sector is becoming more dangerous.
106 2018-08-21 22:50:38 it blows my mind that some people choose not to be organ donors.
107 2018-08-21 22:49:57 Making equity more accessible to retail investors thru tokenization is pretty cool, esp given the % of society that doesn't own any stocks

111 2018-08-21 22:46:27 I don’t think so. She was married to a Heinz prior. But it’s said they sold most of their stocks and have less than 4 percent.
112 2018-08-21 22:46:14 Mueller, Rosenstein et al know they only have some level of safety from being dragged off to the stocks themselves, while the investigation is running. Look forward to more excuses to keep it alive.
113 2018-08-21 22:45:55 sold a bunch of stocks today. All for a  nice profit and bought a car cash.

Toyotas and Hondas were out of the budget but bought a 2013 ford escape 100k clicks and ecoboost. 

Insurance will actually go down even know car is 8 years newer.

Gas will also be cheaper.

Sweet!

131 2018-08-21 22:34:27 Thanks.  I am always hedged.  Still have a few Short #ES with short puts.

And a few bear calls and Iron condors on some over-valued stocks.

I love volatility and anything that increases vols.  Without volatility, 2/3 of my strategies won't work. I hated 2017, the entire year.

156 2018-08-21 22:11:57 Total LIE!! Our Elec went up 30%!! Gas costs are UP, debt is UP, no money for infrastructure but Corp CEO get #GOPTaxScam cuts to buy back their stocks, as they pay workers LESS. Trickle down didn't work in the 80's, it's worse now with #TrumpTariffs raising costs on EVERYTHING!!
157 2018-08-21 22:11:11 That rule set is actual cheeks. No morphs no meters 3 stocks 8 minutes no problem. Stages can get figured out later but with so many possible legal stages it's probable we'll get a seasonal stage selection.

159 2018-08-21 22:09:43 A financial adviser told me stocks don't react that quickly to things like this. It's subtle and there is usually an indication. We saw a dip...now we may see another one. It's coming. News of Trump's demise will trigger all the GOP to dump their stock/bail on him, all rich fucks

166 2018-08-21 22:04:41 for all you morons out there selling stocks remember worst case is that pence a much better man and politician would become pres and the repubs would be willing to work much harder for him...bullish for stocks

170 2018-08-21 22:03:49 the thing that boosts melee in the aspect of more stocks imo is because of how fast they go, melee edgeguards are much more fatal than any other smash games imo
171 2018-08-21 22:03:21 Stocks are up. But America has never been more divided as a people. That’s the problem. People are hating on each other. Stocks don’t fix that.

177 2018-08-21 21:59:15 Next time use a black background with a light in the middle and some stocks it'll help even if it's not a theme
178 2018-08-21 21:58:57 Honestly if it’s a game that’s 1v1 counter punch is always optimal... 3 stocks it is

180 2018-08-21 21:58:19 And all tax cuts removed, and probably increase what was, businesses  move out. If dems win mid terms watch your stocks. Returement funds hurt

183 2018-08-21 21:55:23 3 stocks definently
184 2018-08-21 21:55:09 inflation is low?! you must have not tried buying property or stocks anytime in the last 10 years. Of course people are not throwing their hard earned dollars into food and washing machines. it goes into stocks and real estate. Inflation is off the charts in each of those!
185 2018-08-21 21:54:54 #pvamu anyone wanna teach me about stocks? Is there a club or class on it???
186 2018-08-21 21:54:40 I think if the US cancelled the trade war, stocks would rally.
187 2018-08-21 21:54:21 Un deal pour des stocks restants du blanc avec 1 étoile ?
188 2018-08-21 21:53:42 We remember when Debt concerned @SpeakerRyan, Now he's raised debt by a TRILLION, cut taxes for billionaires who used tax cuts to buy back stocks in their Corp.'s. This SHORTAGE leave NO MONEY for people, schools, roads. @SpeakerRyan betrays the country, the people, the Party.
189 2018-08-21 21:53:41 Yet, the mercy of stocks in the long run isn’t that bad, right?
190 2018-08-21 21:51:32 So? She sold 20 % of Uranium stocks for $100s of millions!!!
191 2018-08-21 21:50:18 I feel so bad for the family of Mollie Tibbetts. If you did not know they found a body and they believe it is Mollie Tibbetts after the suspect took the police right to her. Her body was discovered under a bunch of corn stocks in a field. (Part 1 of 2)
192 2018-08-21 21:49:00 Bitcoin is being built as the ultimate financial system that can run the whole economic world. Its to obvious. Liquid sidechains,micropayments (LN), settlements, digital assets(stocks)issued on Sidechains creating a scecure digital stockmarket pegged to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is = ∞
193 2018-08-21 21:48:28 Market risk index update - 08/21/18
Stocks: Global stock market risk remained at a high risk level (61%).
Bonds: The global bond market risk remained at a low risk level of 35% (last week: 49%).
FX: US Dollar risk remained low at 12% (last week: 15%).
194 2018-08-21 21:48:10 I think that if heaven exists, it may well smell of night-scented stocks. Glorious, ephemeral & divine scent.
195 2018-08-21 21:47:28 30k in stocks
196 2018-08-21 21:47:00 Have you traded your stocks yet?
197 2018-08-21 21:45:44 Despite the news, stocks are up. Why?
198 2018-08-21 21:45:13 We only trade stocks with millions in volume so liquidity is not an issue.
At the time of $CVM trade it had volume of up to 80k per min while $TSLA had only 15k. Not to mention other ones we traded $CRON $TLRY ...

200 2018-08-21 21:44:40 That’s what I’ve been saying. It looks about the same as S4 in amount of time it takes to get rid of stocks. I’m not sure 3 stock would be best honestly. I haven’t played it but I’ve def seen 2 stock, 1v1, no item matches take 4 minutes.

We could be playing it like S4 tho

I guess she wants to live as a pauper because according @CNNMoney most of her millions are in mutual funds, stocks and bonds... I guess her Senate salary of $174,000 will be enough for her in the future.
221 2018-08-21 21:32:32 correct, as the dollar will continue to rise, stocks will fall
222 2018-08-21 21:32:05 And we should be forced to pay for what you think they "deserve"? No. How about: They get their frigging lives together and get a skill we, as a people, need. I don't need burger flippers. I need nurses. I need engineers not a fry guy.
223 2018-08-21 21:31:58 Hot water bottle cover. It’s what we did with ours. Sorry, to be correct, it’s what we did with **all**  of ours...

225 2018-08-21 21:30:58 Yup. Low skill workers are a dime a dozen. Why overpay? Not my fault they can't get it together to get a trade or a much needed skill. Minimum wage was never meant to be lived. They made their lot in life. Why would I reward absolute failure?

228 2018-08-21 21:28:56 i really dont see how the indices can go up on this info... certain stocks sure but indices... not so much ... a better entry always sounds good 2 me! hope for lower
229 2018-08-21 21:28:52 Yeah we can't and we won't. No reason to become a welfare state where 50% of a nation gets a free ride while the other 50% has to pay through the nose. 2017 IRS file data is out. 50% of 117M tax filers paid 97.2% of FICA. Bottom 50%? 2.8%. That's the group begging for freebies.

Response: More anti-gun security theater. How many public mass murders have been used using trigger actuators?  How about bump stocks?  Do you know the answer? It is ONE which may have used a bump stock.
234 2018-08-21 21:24:29 Stocks hit all-time highs for the first time since January: WHILE THE "REAL" MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE GET POORER AND POORER !!

240 2018-08-21 21:20:34 Not quite. (1) UK signed UN agreements on managing fish stocks, which requires cooperation on quotas, Brexit or not. (2) The UK, not EU, privatised quotas (they're not saleable in IRL, FR) which were sold by UK boat-owners to 'UK regd.' firms who'll keep them even after Brexit.

248 2018-08-21 21:16:20 These people talking of impeaching this president, its as if they want the markets to crash - imo - if that was to happen you better dump all stocks and wait for a better entry - and talk about a VIX spike - shittt
249 2018-08-21 21:15:54 Everything is bullish for stocks.  Growing economy, companies make more money.  Slowing economy, lower rates.  Effective President, gets things done, good for stocks.  Ineffective Prez, gridlock, can't mess things up.  Just shut up and BTFD.

306 2018-08-21 20:52:13 Yes I am debating buying a put... I think we will get a pull back hoping for low 40s but realistically may only go as low as 45 or 46 given the potential for news flow...
307 2018-08-21 20:51:34 Only news I saw was a crude draw.  Means that if oil spikes and it drives inflation and that is enough to panic stocks, they aren't as cozy as the price they print.

337 2018-08-21 20:34:31 I don't think China is going to outright short the U.S. stock market and try to profit from this. That is far too risky for them. The problem with shorting is that if you get your timing wrong, you can be forced to cut at a massive loss.

Not many countries directly trade stocks

No smash meter (mechanic seems too broken until it's revealed In testing)

349 2018-08-21 20:29:26 U.S. stocks are on the verge of surpassing their LONGEST-RUNNING RALLY. - @WSJ 

To all the socialists who’ve been trolling me this morning about the evils of Capitalism - we’re done talking.
350 2018-08-21 20:29:03 Did you have a plan? Use a set % of UR trading capital? Use a stop loss? Stay disciplined in respect 2 plan?

If not, it sounds like U were over exposed, "hoping" it went up.

Penny stocks are volatile & going into ANY trade w/out plan is asking 4 trouble!

369 2018-08-21 20:20:23 The benchmark S&P 500 touched a record high on Tuesday and equaled its longest-ever bull-market run, as U.S. stocks rose on encouraging earnings reports and hopes that the United States and China could resolve their tariff dispute.
370 2018-08-21 20:20:06 Flag on the tweet. Misleading. Penalty for encouraging class war. The rich have always owned most of the stocks. Root cited study gives much more detail. Worth reading. Neither the article nor the study contrast the amount of taxes paid to the amount of stock owned.
371 2018-08-21 20:18:04 We traded 5 stocks today and locked solid total gain on the day

372 2018-08-21 20:17:33 This is probably the worst possible ruleset I can imagine. 4 stocks too much and too long, stage morph adds basically nothing so idrc but making stage pick random is giving random advantages disadvantages why would that be a good thing and smash meter

374 2018-08-21 20:16:01 Stocks post broad advance. S&P 500 hits new all-time high intraday, then retreats to close +0.2%. New highs also reached by Russell 2000 small-stock index (+1.1%), S&P midcap (+0.8%), Dow transports (+0.7%).

Dow 30 +63, +0.3% to 25,822 and Nasdaq +0.5% but no new highs for them.
375 2018-08-21 20:14:36 Pot stocks rallying huh?
376 2018-08-21 20:14:07 #HSW interesting because that was really a Profit Warning this morning but it's Closed down 5.1% which by recent standards of Stocks doing Warnings is barely anything. I guess much priced in already.
377 2018-08-21 20:13:58 Yea, me too.  Cornelius Groot (Kees Grut) is spelling. He talked to me about how challenged stocks tend to be more volatile in their highs and lows.  So larger large returns, and lower lows' kinda of thing.  So for example the Fraser Sockeye Bust then Boom affect not a good sign.
378 2018-08-21 20:13:47 I'm worried Too much piling on pot stocks

390 2018-08-21 20:08:15 Here's my Smash Ultimate Ruleset:

-3 stocks, 6 minutes
-Hazards OFF
-Final Smash OFF
-Rage OFF
-all animal crossing music banned bc I swear to god there's 900 other songs in the game & if I have to hear Tom Nook's Store or KK Rider one fucking time in this game sO HELP ME GOD
391 2018-08-21 20:06:53 curious what is rationale for investors to  "dump"/"buy" ~200k stocks right at start and end of day...
392 2018-08-21 20:06:21 Playing Ultimate with 2 stocks is the way to go, at least in the beginning. If the game proves to move fast enough to warrant 3 stocks then it should be changed, but I think the flow of the game will be (mostly) the same as Smash 4
393 2018-08-21 20:06:20 Excellent advice. I have too many friends who wanted to “get in on stocks” but they expected overnight returns and lost both patience and their $ selling on fear. It takes YEARS sometimes for your investment in a company to grow, you have to be patient.
394 2018-08-21 20:05:59 @SenWarren proposed a ban on lawmakers owning individual stocks in a speech today. I’m assuming she didn’t get her monthly stipend from the Cherokee Nation and can’t buy any gambling stocks. Sorry #Pocahontas #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
395 2018-08-21 20:05:35 Stocks were up until Trump’s lawyer and his campaign chairman make front page court news and Trump can’t be talked out of his War with the World on Trade!
396 2018-08-21 20:04:52 I really have no business in individual stocks. I get too anxious when I'm down, and too hurried to sell if I get even a decent gain. If I sell and make a few bucks, I'm usually lucky. Stay out of stock picking, JOSH!!
397 2018-08-21 20:03:43 My 2 cents for smash ultimate ruleset

-3 stocks 6 min looking like a sweet spot

400 2018-08-21 20:03:14 invest in low beta instruments, aka penny stocks
401 2018-08-21 20:02:38 #Grains ended lower. Livestock, US Dollar were lower. S&P 500 at all-time high.
US Stocks, Softs, #Crude, Gold & #copper were all higher today.
402 2018-08-21 20:02:17 $IGC and $NEWA Prime Overnight set ups strong closes on weed stocks as well
403 2018-08-21 20:01:31 US stocks closed higher on the day, with the S&P 500 hitting an intraday high but closing below it: $DJIA +63, $SPX +6
404 2018-08-21 20:01:28 US stocks closed higher on the day, with the S&P 500 hitting an intraday high but closing below it: $DJIA +63, $SPX +6
405 2018-08-21 20:01:26 Fully agree. I am trying to exit from @reliancegroup stocks but what to do almost 90% of the value has been wiped out. So retail investors like myself are stuck with this both ethically & otherwise bankrupt group.
406 2018-08-21 20:01:21 Good ! J’suis obligé d’attendre un tout petit peu en esperant que ca reste comme ca. Ils ont un mois pour prevoir ces stocks haha. Bonne soirée et merci pour cette rapide réponse !!
407 2018-08-21 20:01:13 #Grains ended lower. Livestock, US Dollar were lower. #SP500 at all-time high. US Stocks, Softs, Crude, #Gold & Copper were all higher today.
408 2018-08-21 19:59:37 i've seen many sets of investor statements over the years that show stocks at an almost -100% loss whereby investors became attached and emotionally committed to holding out a downtrend... don't get caught with huge losses!
409 2018-08-21 19:59:35 In other news (1)
Delighted to discover that @BootsUK in Fleet Street stocks @lizearle range. The best moisturisers in the world. Light, absorbent, natural but do the job. Haven’t discovered anything better in the last decade.
410 2018-08-21 19:59:34 Coming from a conservative, some of these ideas are great like banning Congressmen from owning individual stocks + banning lobbying post-Congress. Others need to be hashed out, like forcing a President to sell illiquid assets. Overall these issues are all worth a conversation.
411 2018-08-21 19:58:41 Post Malone is safe.

Buy Stocks
412 2018-08-21 19:58:05 130 Republican and Democratic congressional members have invested in company stocks while making legislative decisions that impact those same companies..and no one says a thing about it.
413 2018-08-21 19:57:59 It's ludicrous that it's not already the case. Members of Congress are often entitled to sensetive and sometimes even classified information. Information that can be used to purchase the "correct" stocks.
414 2018-08-21 19:56:39 I agree with the reasoning for the switch, but don't agree with arguments against GLD.  Yeah you need double, so get double.  Performance of GLD in isolation is irrelevant, its how it functions in a portfolio. GLD is a completely new asset class (a +) but GDX is just more stocks.
415 2018-08-21 19:55:59 I'm really happy to come home to see all my stocks are up. I needed some good news.
416 2018-08-21 19:55:45 $IFRX sold out at $30.51 for a small gain.  Rethought this one, combo of ultra low volume and near term catalyst.  Too many names out their with data remaining in 2018 and trying to consolidate the number of bio stocks I am invested in.  This on will be interesting next year.
417 2018-08-21 19:55:33 3 stocks i own apple, amazon, and walmart...i am lucky to own them...mike francesca thinks its skill that he owns them
418 2018-08-21 19:55:28 - How you doing?

420 2018-08-21 19:54:59 Intrigued about more information on "future hair" for investment purposes in hair market stocks and bonds.
421 2018-08-21 19:54:47 @RampCapitalLLC I could be wrong but today shows a touch fragility in the market so I think the safest and best thing to do is go all in and buy growth stocks
422 2018-08-21 19:54:13 شنو يعني مسددين ؟
423 2018-08-21 19:53:54 @elonmusk Just bought some tesla stocks. Keep your head up   so many people are rooting for you.
424 2018-08-21 19:53:48 It depends. I still think gameplay should be more combo heavy so hitstun could help make guaranteed combos. That will help this 3 stock method instead of just trading hits at the final seconds. 2 stocks seems good tho at this point
425 2018-08-21 19:52:48 Stocks have nothing to do with Trump and Obama started that trend so he's not soley responsible as he would like everyone to believe.  Even Sanders has to admit it.
426 2018-08-21 19:52:42 okay! first off, banks are refusing service to huge swaths of americans based on political beliefs millions hold. most states allow the sale of guns to anyone over 18.
bump stocks' function can be replicated easily. 'high capacity mags' have been standard capacity since the 1940s
427 2018-08-21 19:52:07 I don’t normally enjoy holding oil stocks for results but I’m making a rear exception for #AAOG
428 2018-08-21 19:51:42 People are comfortable holding stocks for 10 years for a 3 to 4x but can’t stand holding crypto for six months for a possible 10x
429 2018-08-21 19:51:41 It would be kinda funny if stocks closed lower after all the "ALL TIME HIGHS" hoo ha today
430 2018-08-21 19:51:16 Elizabeth Warren's bill nullifies the value of stocks and delivers majority ownership of companies to  unions and workers. Violation of unreasonable seizures clause of the Constitution
431 2018-08-21 19:50:27 Mutual funds try and hug or beat their benchmark, that's why they chase performance and its why they're really closet index funds.
Hedge fund managers like David Tepper make asymmetric bets on stocks like $TEVA and that's why he's a billionaire and now owns the Panthers.

437 2018-08-21 19:48:22 Both Buffett and Tepper bottom ticked $TEVA Teva which has more than doubled in less than a year. You buy 10-15 of those type of stocks every year and you will do well.

439 2018-08-21 19:47:59 I felt like shit yesterday. I was interviewed for a role in which I am clearly capable of. However, because I have got no experience in this country nor gained my degree in here, the company does not want to bet on me. This reminded me why I am trading (crypto and stocks) anyways
440 2018-08-21 19:47:50 Bring. Back the stocks.
441 2018-08-21 19:47:22 Heading into the close, Stocks are higher, off best levels.

445 2018-08-21 19:43:08 @EddieHearn you have two of the best heavyweights in the world in your stable. Both stocks are high and your willing to sacrifice one of them by letting them face each other? I don't see why you would jeopardise or risks whytes hard work in his rise in the wbc rankings.
446 2018-08-21 19:43:07 How is it the same group pumps the same stocks? Check out everyone pumping $EAST and see if you recognize some names.
447 2018-08-21 19:42:42 Couldn’t be arsed
448 2018-08-21 19:41:56 Probably some truth to this. That selling pressure coincided exactly to ATH

“Although there were no clear fundamental developments behind the broad-based USD weakness, a jump by the S&P 500 to a new record high may have caused a flow of capital out of the dollar into stocks.”
449 2018-08-21 19:41:48 Shitcoins can’t go to zero. Shit stocks can go to zero quite easily.

Isn't that #ES_F $SPY #Stocks #options #futures $ES_F #DowJones BULLISH???
451 2018-08-21 19:41:13 Maybe Book Point’s clients are limited to what the bookstore stocks. Surely Aristoc would tell a different tale as they do stock books on Econ & Innovation & then some. Though whether these books are best sellers is a different story altogether. 
452 2018-08-21 19:40:45 Great work.. some multibaggers and real gem stocks.

459 2018-08-21 19:38:07 After my first #experience with a real big volume #OTC gainer $CVSI I can say that listed stocks have much more choppy patterns. #OTC patterns are clear & tape & L2 reading make it much more comfortable to hold & trust patterns when #patience is needed.
460 2018-08-21 19:36:54 Pot stocks coming back well. Now if you truly believe in momentum up, again, this go around then those companies' stock that have warrants that publicly trade that have say at least 1.5-2 years minimum to expiry with a exercise price that is reachable and not a punt, give torque.

477 2018-08-21 19:29:10 To this point, won’t stocks held in pensions and other tax deferred accounts rise in price as the after tax value of stocks rises? That’s gonna be priced in.

482 2018-08-21 19:26:41 What a mind reader, @JRubinBlogger!  Care to tell me what stocks are going up tomorrow?
483 2018-08-21 19:23:57 Quick question... The guy that you found trying to steal it - what happened to him? I genuinely feel that a man who steals another person's bike should be put in stocks and left next to bowls of fruit.
484 2018-08-21 19:23:41 Met this afternoon with Lamar Villere of Villere Balanced Fund ($VILLX) for thoughts on market. Bottom up stock picker so getting harder to find good values. Holding more cash as a result. But loves stocks he already owns, such as...
485 2018-08-21 19:23:02 Seen that. Bought tqqq yesterday anticipating it playing catch up.  Tech stocks firming a bit
486 2018-08-21 19:22:00 As a very long term investor, I regret selling stocks much more than I have ever regretted buying.
487 2018-08-21 19:21:48 Half of households own stocks, but regardless, what could cause ownership to triple?
488 2018-08-21 19:21:30 Do you consider Canadian (or US) cannabis stocks for “Under 10” or must they be part of those stocks covered by Zacks? Or are cannabis stocks too risky with little/no profit yet? Thinking of recent STZ purchase of C$5B of C$32 (TSX) WEED for C$48. And ACB, WMD etc.
489 2018-08-21 19:21:01 And if you like shorting otc scammy penny stocks then you'll love $BUDZ  People keep confusing it with Canopy because the company is weed inc. and Canopys CAD ticker is $WEED @CNBCFastMoney even makes this mistake on every weed segment @timseymour
490 2018-08-21 19:20:56 “The new policy...prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.”

I’m not seeing the part that inspires this rush to your fainting couch.
491 2018-08-21 19:20:54 It blows my mind that it’s just one doctor who was only interested in making profits from something else that caused all of this. Even knowing how the thirst for profit is warping our society, still this stands out as beyond belief.

Honest to god I’d throw him in the stocks
492 2018-08-21 19:20:13 as someone seemingly stuck in their ways or a 2-stock-elitist. 

More so for second case. I see before leaning towards 2 stocks, not absolute advocates for them
493 2018-08-21 19:20:08 9 times out of 10, when I see people say "i think we should start with 2 stocks", they aren't die hard advocates. (The word "advocate" to me implies someone very in defense of their claim or non-moderate). I think it's unfair to call anyone saying "2 stocks appeals to me more"
494 2018-08-21 19:19:38 Alright bitches. So at slcc and maybe at your school too, the library not only probably stocks most of your textbooks, but if they don't you can REQUEST that they get it and then they WILL
495 2018-08-21 19:19:35 $CLPS Might be fine but see no reason to take any (potential) loss on this with so many other strong stocks. Position closed at break even.
496 2018-08-21 19:19:20 But it is absolutely a great idea. They shouldn't be trading stocks in the market.
497 2018-08-21 19:19:01 I'm waiting for my watch to sync, then I think I might sit in the garden and see if the night-scented stocks are blooming yet.
498 2018-08-21 19:18:18 I'm certain every #news #Reporters has on #depends today so they won't miss the big stories while in the bathroom!  I guess  @poise's  and #depends' stocks will show profits in the  3rd quarter!

500 2018-08-21 19:16:58 I'm trying to push these stocks so I don't ever have to work or deal with dwights unless I need fresh towels or I need a mixed fruit bowl.
501 2018-08-21 19:15:39 Investing in stocks is the way to go
502 2018-08-21 19:15:33 With the discovery of a nitrogen-fixing #corn variety, seems like a good time to short the Oct 2067 option contracts on all nitrogen fertilizer stocks #oatt
503 2018-08-21 19:14:43 lets not push it. I'd prefer 3 stocks 7 minutes
504 2018-08-21 19:14:24 Man, his pot stocks site clearly disclosed that he’s paid and how much.  Does he need to tattoo it on his forehead? Do some DD rather than blindly following tweets.  I know it seems like I’m in love with this guy but I’m just preaching common sense I think.
505 2018-08-21 19:14:13 I see popcorn and candy stocks going up up up...we all will be sitting back to watch this show
506 2018-08-21 19:14:03 I believe that most pot stocks are hugely over-valued and are a day trade at best. Just say'n.
507 2018-08-21 19:13:59 The law needs to ban all immediate members of their family from owning stocks; otherwise these people will just get these stocks in their spouses or kid's names.
508 2018-08-21 19:12:39 Quick job turnover. A killing to be made in cemetery stocks! Coffins for coffers! No pension eligibility for those who die young! A win win win. No extended Medicare costs for the nonexistent elderly. The environment as Kevorkian euthanasia! The Grim Reaper with a Midas touch!
509 2018-08-21 19:12:39 Um, it’s not a competition. @Kodak is re-releasing old film stocks and new companies like @CineStillFilm and @lomography are on the rise. Every artist reaches for different tools in their toolbox.

520 2018-08-21 19:09:43 No way. Maybe the corps that have been richly rewarded by his tax cuts can use that money for this benefit rather than buy back trillions of dollars of stocks to reward the executives. The swamp is deep and nutty as hell.

523 2018-08-21 19:06:26 Many popular stocks have high PE and are over bought. They seem like growth stocks but it's gambling because we don't know by numerical analysis that it's a good value at the price. Dividends provide a level of insurance.

Sorry just b/c U R friends with an idiot doesn't make Roger Ver a scammer. The site clearly labels BTC vs BCH. It's your friends fault for not knowing the difference between the two. Does he also buy stocks and bonds without knowing what he is doing?

546 2018-08-21 18:55:03 My wife used to work at Goldman and in her department, which was essentially a trading desk her and I weren’t allowed to trade individual stocks and we aren’t making policy that can completely change the fortunes of companies. Absolute no brainer.

548 2018-08-21 18:52:49 Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to ban Congress and the WH staff from owning individual stocks — and replace them with government-managed investment accounts.
If you'd like to lessen corruption look no farther than the Russia Hoax and Crooked Hillary Clinton.
549 2018-08-21 18:52:41 just individual stocks? sounds like a good opportunity for a creative broker to set up a Congress Member's Special Mutual Fund consisting of 99% one company's stock and 1% of a few others.
550 2018-08-21 18:52:33 Do you have list of stocks your watching for earnings in the next 2-3 weeks?
551 2018-08-21 18:52:18 Hi Axel,
From some 15000 stocks my program is following, I collect about 60 in my list of Favorites, all of them returning at least 30% during the last 5 consecutive years. Interesting changes will be tweeted from time to time. PB me if you want the whole list at once
552 2018-08-21 18:52:14 Depends on ur state, I can't buy any crypto, only stocks for now
553 2018-08-21 18:51:48 i think congressmen should live at the prevailing minimum wage and get medicaid benefits only, all stocks frozen and no use of assets beyond the 2000 limit for medicaid, they must also use foodstamps eligible for a person working minimum wage
554 2018-08-21 18:51:37 Ehh. You'd have to draw the line pretty high and policy oriented. I don't much care if the travel office staff have stocks, and requiring them to pay for blind trusts or lose jobs is bad. Or does this allow for mutual fund ownership?
555 2018-08-21 18:51:00 My guess is that the authorities are giving the Funds & Institutions some time to dump their stocks on retail Teslemming bagholders.
When they are done with their distribution the ”trap door” will open up under the bagholder feets.
556 2018-08-21 18:50:56 Not sure how "government managed" accounts would work. S&P 500 Index funds would be an excellent fund, since it is an average of many stocks.

571 2018-08-21 18:43:10 The other trick I'm using is picking something that doesn't have real value until some event happens (death).

This is to show that some assets (stocks, real estate, etc.) have a 'paper value' that isn't realized, and shouldn't be taxed, until they are sold.

575 2018-08-21 18:40:30 The lowest level GS-1 clerk in the federal govt is banned from owning any stock that might be affected by the work of his/her agency. NIH employees can’t own biomed stocks.

599 2018-08-21 18:32:20 It’s not unusual for big firm lawyers not to own any individual stocks - bcs its a pain to clear conflicts to be able to buy & sell even if the firm doesn’t have material no public info - just use funds

605 2018-08-21 18:28:11 Sen. Elizabeth Warren is off.  I don't think politicians owning stocks is as much of a problem as lobbyists, political contributions from foreign governments, and using legislation to increase real estate values that politicians are invested in are.

629 2018-08-21 18:18:51 to buy stocks now and trade 1/3 once we get going on the bounces.  If you are lucky enough to get a 4X-7X then sell out. But, then trade 1/4-1/3 of what is a larger kiddy.  This is what I plan to do.  I did this w IBAS long ago and BLFS just recently.

661 2018-08-21 18:05:39 Judging by this match it lasted almost like a smash 4 game. I think 2 stocks would be okay. But it also feels like it should be 3 stocks so idunno what to decide

I'm just trying to imagine a counter argument to congressmen being able to own individual stocks.

680 2018-08-21 17:56:02 you should save how many stocks untill we have a better idea on how long the stocks last on average
 I think smash meter is a good idea starting off as it is regulated and not completely random Going forward an educated decision can be made. 
The stage select is questionable
681 2018-08-21 17:55:48 Execution is key when trading stocks. It’s not about how many times you can trade. Learning! 
682 2018-08-21 17:55:43 Elon you can be influencing people like that... you might cause Rice Krispies stocks to skyrocket.
683 2018-08-21 17:54:13 I was saying not buying individual stocks is a good idea for everyone. Not that a rule against buying individual stocks was good for everyone.

I thought that was clear after at least my second or third attempts to explain. Sorry, will try to stick to 800+ words in the future.

686 2018-08-21 17:52:46 There are journalism outlets that require reporters to NOT own individual stocks to avoid even an appearance of conflict of interest or impropriety. Mutual funds were fine....
687 2018-08-21 17:52:37 Its marketing language buddy.
Everything is said to be "while stocks last" everywhere.

691 2018-08-21 17:51:09 In a game with so many chars, I don't wanna play 2 stocks. So few chances to learn your opponent's kill confirms. 3 stocks has always and still is the obvious choice for SSBU.

694 2018-08-21 17:49:15 I agree the nature of the game will lend itself to three stocks but the K Rool video is definitely jumping to conclusions
695 2018-08-21 17:48:59 The leading #stocks are often breaking out before the broad #market breaks out. That means you often have already #trading positions before the market takes of.

698 2018-08-21 17:47:50 How about they can’t buy individual stocks while they’re in Congress? Easy to enforce.
699 2018-08-21 17:47:23 If an index like the Russell 2000 $IWM is breaking out to new highs, the chances are very high that a lot of #stocks are printing new highs at the same time.
 You have to decide which stock you should buy. 
 You need rules for stock selection.

705 2018-08-21 17:44:52 I agree the vid shouldn’t have anything to do with pace of the game/stock count but I also think 3 stocks should be the stock count

711 2018-08-21 17:41:45 These are great! Fascinating that even the 50-90% have only 5% in stocks and 15% in bonds/cash. Would've been nice to see 50-80% and 80-99% and 1%

713 2018-08-21 17:41:40 .@datarade TSLA: shorts with big losing positions are planting stories in media to try and scrounge up some cheap stock. They hope that market makers will short stock into the stocks downward move, drive it even lower. Aint happening
714 2018-08-21 17:41:28 I’m still of the mind that 3 stocks will likely end up making more sense but using that gameplay as an argument for 3 stocks given all the stipulations is a little silly yeah
715 2018-08-21 17:41:17 You mean, it's NOT going to end?

719 2018-08-21 17:39:03 100% what I was just talking about and what I just tweeted about. I personally think 3 stocks will likely be better in the end, but we don't know for sure until we see this all in action
720 2018-08-21 17:38:57 The math is easy. It is the economic part I am mystified by. How to incorporate in the Milky Way-Andromeda galaxy? Should we expect supercivilizations to have interest rates near zero and does that mean it is all about investing in stocks? @paulkrugman theorems in LambdaCDM unis?
721 2018-08-21 17:38:49 Stocks are up in the first half of the day.  MBS is down 8 bps, while Yields rebound up to 2.85%.  A possible Stochastic Crossover is soon developing, which may lead to a reversal in the trend for Yields and MBS.  Another slow news day, but optimism by investors over China talks.
722 2018-08-21 17:38:41 I’d be fine with stocks outside of 401(k).
723 2018-08-21 17:37:32 It has been about 7 months since the S&P 500 hit it's previous record high. Are you confident in your investment strategy at these levels?

753 2018-08-21 17:24:12 Forex trading theoretically gives me the highest return percentage so I think I will just leave the money in my savings account until I finish testing my trading plan.  Stocks in the short run are too risky, and savings account gives a better return than my sock drawer.

758 2018-08-21 17:23:14 True... I’m not allowed to short stocks or buy options anymore 
759 2018-08-21 17:22:55 It's the economy for the 10-15% of people who own 90% of the stocks

784 2018-08-21 17:12:48 That is total bull. Student loans are available for everyone —there are even more options for those who don’t have a lot of means (need-based scholarships). Many people worked their way through school too. I am sick of hearing that education is only for wealthy.
785 2018-08-21 17:12:36 On one hand, the King K. Rool video showed today that the game is so fast that it should be 3 stocks.

On the other, there were LITERALLY two blocked attacks that entire match so that match speed may be skewed and it might still need to be 2 stocks.

793 2018-08-21 17:09:51 A shorter timer promotes timeouts! If a game of 3 stocks were to naturally take 5 minutes I'm gonna go for a timeout on the last minute every single time. If you want less timeouts you need a longer timer.
794 2018-08-21 17:09:27 That's what I'm saying...the only reason you need a bureaucracy to determine if a congressman owns a stock or not is if there are a lot of exceptions to congressmen owning stocks.

801 2018-08-21 17:07:26 I have $1,400 in capital saved and no clue how to deploy it.  I am still working on trading, and even if I were ready, my risk rules would keep my returns minuscule.  Could go with stocks, but same problem applies - just not enough to do anything.

803 2018-08-21 17:07:00 The S&P 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to an all-time high. The index  is up more than 7 percent in 2018, led by gains of more than 15 percent in technology and consumer discretionary stocks and an almost 11 percent rally in health-care companies.
804 2018-08-21 17:06:37 From my recent observations; ORB set-ups have not been working as well as they've been in late July and early August (the thick of earnings season). Best set-ups/moves have been happening later in the morning 10:00am to 11:00am or so and generally in stocks making secondary moves

Also why not make cosmetical gun parts like stocks and handguards as skins. Changing the look of the akm stock, awm barrel / stock, m16 handguard, etc. would be fantastic.

Please.

922 2018-08-21 16:29:54 of course it's just us exchanging opinions, we can't do anything else at this point. There is another thing that people are forgetting. Those 1.5M pre-orders are not 1.5M actual pre-sales. Those are stocks that the stores ordered, but they can sell in 1 week, 1 month or 1 year.

1014 2018-08-21 15:51:48 But I'm ready. Waiting for the market corrects itself which is soon. Tax cuts to the rich to buyback stocks to prop up there companies and not pass it to employees is sick. Continued wealth moving from the middle class to the rich is in full affect right in our faces.

1051 2018-08-21 15:36:39 Noticed the same correlation, but it seems that it's flipped (stockmarkets and crypto).

Assuming from there that we'll see a correction in the next months on stocks & upwards momentum on crypto, as there's not much upwards potential anymore in the stock markets and techstocks.

1065 2018-08-21 15:32:32 Technically the stock is ready for a Big Jump in the near future. Before that it may consolidate 2-3 days more . Be patient and it may hit new 52 weeks high before expiry and may move up to 720-725 level .

1066 2018-08-21 15:31:57 I understand there's a market for it but when I look at a stocks I always ask myself this question: can this be a ten bagger? By that I mean, does the company have the assets, product or services to generate 10 times their current value.

1182 2018-08-21 14:44:19 True there are a lot of people pushing stocks or telling you how the market works. I’d give the same advice to anyone, before you take their advice ask them what their personal investing performance is like.

So, a traditional 60/40 may not be the best benchmark.

1224 2018-08-21 14:30:03 The whole thing about weed stocks is when they were really cheap they didn't suit a risk profile enough to put a lot of money in to make a huge return. You could look back and say "if I put x into it..." but u would have been taking a huge risk. Look at the finaicial statements.

1244 2018-08-21 14:23:29 It's also because the idea that monetary policy is "the economic policy area that most affects stocks" is wrong (over anything other than short term messing). Fiscal is way more powerful. Way. More. A $1trln deficit is mana for corporate bottom lines.

1260 2018-08-21 14:18:52  thing I’m working on (since I’m still very green) is paying attention to the price action of 3 stocks that I like, and only those 3.  Once I know their shit cold.  How they interact with HOD,LOD....does it trad. fill the gap etc or even overfill then I move on to 1 new fav.
1261 2018-08-21 14:18:42 Meh, they'll just set up trusts or have the stocks bought in a family member's name.

1297 2018-08-21 14:07:26 Why does everyone call this investing.  It's really just legalized gambling.  Companies only receive investment capital when they are the sellers of the stock.  Trading in stocks is just buying from someone in the hopes you can sell at a higher price to someone else.

1300 2018-08-21 14:06:38 It depends on how you manage your stocks.  Day trading, then yes it's kinda like gambling.  Like a company and want to have a vested interest in it, then buy stock.  Only thing is to research their health first.

1401 2018-08-21 13:20:54 7/ growth stocks have more real appreciation pricing than being inflated. and that’s more or less is debatable . Appreciation is mosty driven by innovation, competitive advantage, or game changing (i.e. blue ocean)
1402 2018-08-21 13:20:45 6/ Generally, growth stocks do not pay dividends and highly R&D invested. While value stock does pay dividends on regular basis. couple of cases where value stock issues debt for the sake to fund dividend payouts.

1404 2018-08-21 13:20:38 5/ Growth stocks are often keep rising higher despite the fact it is overvalued while value stocks are mostly fluctuating to be overvalued and undervalued during the same period. Growth stocks are the ones shows the trend in a chart while value shows siding to whipsaws.
1405 2018-08-21 13:20:30 4/ For example, $CGC is Food/Bev is a growth stock while $INTC is tech-industry being a value stock. Generally, growth stocks are not industry-related and occasionally, a company do differentiate itself from the industry

1413 2018-08-21 13:18:33 Discount broker stocks drop after report J.P. Morgan will offer free trades  // Bodes not well for discount brokers $AMTD $ETFC as $JPM looks to be one stop parking place for people's money. Surprised took this long to get there.  $JPM back to $115+ at open likely
1414 2018-08-21 13:18:09 Addie, lives on Vista Corazon with wife and 2 kids.

Put all their savings into sea salt stocks. Can't retire.
1415 2018-08-21 13:17:21 Are u going bankruptcy? Your stocks is all time low. Whats up?
1416 2018-08-21 13:17:20 @TheRealWiseOne I been following 2 Cannabis stocks, Cron and CGC. Both up 40+% this week, you have any thoughts on how high they could go? Probably best to wait for it to dip again to purchase.
1417 2018-08-21 13:16:36 Decide what mutha fuckin’ percentage of your total portfolio you'll allocate to U.S. equities, international stocks, Mutua fuckin’ bonds, and other shit. The shit u get should accomplish your goals while addressing relevant risks.
1418 2018-08-21 13:16:14 $TLYS. Earnings coming. Nice bounce off 8 ema with volume picking up. But with earnings coming, did not add. Was Key List Stock  #stocks
1419 2018-08-21 13:14:44 I am so sad that Robin Hood trading platform chooses to do the first in first out when selling stocks.
1420 2018-08-21 13:13:48 Pharma stocks gained. Cadila Healthcare (up 2.57%), Cipla (up 1.08%), Dr  Reddy's Laboratories (up 1.35%), Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (up 4.36%),  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (up 1.69%),
1421 2018-08-21 13:13:41 Pot stocks continue to fly.... $CGC .  Cramer talking $TLRY just now on Squawk.
1422 2018-08-21 13:12:47 there will also be limited stocks for this batch 
1423 2018-08-21 13:12:41 I assume you traded stocks and futures before, when did you start trading crypto?
1424 2018-08-21 13:12:36 Cramer is finally bullish on marijuana stocks but still hates crypto??
1425 2018-08-21 13:11:59 Calm down
1426 2018-08-21 13:11:58 Counterfeit shares. Its a real problem on Wall Street and ppl like me are furious. Notices stocks getting smacked hard then a recover at the EOD. These guys sell and try to cover lower, then repeat. Fails to deliver is the smoking gun.
1427 2018-08-21 13:11:55 Birkenstock turned down a Supreme collab and I'm so happy. Keep you mf'n wave riders away from the stocks lol

1435 2018-08-21 13:09:27 In my opinion the easy money in the weed stocks $TLRY $CGC and $CRON at least for short term traders is over for the time being. These stocks need a few days to pull back/consolidate before I'd consider touching them again. Just saying...
1436 2018-08-21 13:09:16 Is there a store in the UK that stocks them so I can check one out in person?
1437 2018-08-21 13:08:32 Stocks in focus in pre-market trade today

Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) fell 4.38% 
E-TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) sank 5.63% 
JPMorgan Chase will offer free trades via a new investing app.
1438 2018-08-21 13:08:31 Kohl's stock falls despite solid results. But TJX is popping. Brokerage stocks tumble as JPMorgan Chase launches free trades. And demise of housing market is exaggerated?

1441 2018-08-21 13:07:31 Domestic benchmark equities ended marginally higher today because of renewed buying of pharmaceutical and IT stocks. However, a fall in the banking, metal and FMCG sector weighed the indexes down. Sensex and Nifty ended 0.02% and 0.17% high respectively.
1442 2018-08-21 13:06:47 Morning Market Update: stocks edge higher amid looming trade talks.
1443 2018-08-21 13:06:47 Sell and buy weed stocks. Apparently they are going very high.
1444 2018-08-21 13:06:31 European stocks doing better than opening calls with DAX up 0.65% but Footsie underperforming down marginally on the day..

$AMZN
1452 2018-08-21 13:02:52 I get it's making a new high and that's just fantastic news. but it did the same thing before just about every decline we've seen in stocks. I'm not arguing (right now) if things are strong or weak currently, but I think value line is a weak index to point to for breadth.
1453 2018-08-21 13:02:41 Similar to how Bharti and idea stocks fell during reliance AGM and announcement of JIO.
1454 2018-08-21 13:02:28 Sirji.. this means that all the stocks that has fallen from its top and are probably giving a reversal will end up showing  SUPERBEARISH in "trend" column right.. which can be misleading....

1456 2018-08-21 13:01:12 I'm expecting stocks to break upwards this morning. This is "Weird Wednesday." Looking for opportunities to grow my account this morning after the open. Bonds need to pull back, dollar remain down for stocks to rise.
1457 2018-08-21 13:01:07 What is one tool/service for stocks that you still can’t find or is not satisfied with current paid ones?
1458 2018-08-21 13:01:00 Turkish financial turmoil was the drag, while strong corporate earnings and progress with U.S.-China trade talks sent stocks skyward.

1464 2018-08-21 12:58:23 The S&P 500 will tie the record for the longest U.S. bull market in history today at nearly 3,500 days, rising over 320% since March 9, 2009. It's a record few would have predicted when stocks struggled to find their footing after a 50% plunge during the financial crisis. ~WSJ

1467 2018-08-21 12:57:43 Stocks rose on the trade optimism yesterday but ended off their highs after President Trump said he was "not thrilled" with Fed Chair Powell
1468 2018-08-21 12:57:15 Taking credit for a stocks movement goes both ways. Sounding like Trump.

1490 2018-08-21 12:43:45 Exactly. A big pump analyst upgrade is part and parcel of pretty much every offering these days. Though maybe they would drop coverage if someone else got the offering biz. I see that happen, on really pump and dump garbage stocks.

1508 2018-08-21 12:32:21 Finger in the wind. We get a new All time high in $SPX by Friday Aug 24th and that tops us for the cycle. It is possible we top again in September but if growth/inflation just peaked stocks won't go up starting Oct. Period. 1-2% max upside for cycle.
1509 2018-08-21 12:30:54 premature reaction to withdrawal of the Form 10. The audit and submission of a Form 10 (accounting and legal fees) costs 10s of thousands. I believe we'll see it resubmitted with further details of S800 and upcoming acquisition that are under LOI. That's my take.
1510 2018-08-21 12:30:16 @NSEIndia There's a smart rally on Nifty stocks for a while now. But Nifty index touching new highs is a bit deceptive. Only a few stocks are buoyant and a large majority of scrips have actually lost value for months now...It is possible that there'll be a market correction soon.

1535 2018-08-21 12:14:47 Modest uptick on high div #European stocks brings PF +3/8% on week. Still only a reversal of prev week.

Also fact that #GBP is weaker vs the #EUR (now 111.40)

1539 2018-08-21 12:11:32 I was in the money section of Barnes & Noble yesterday met a young couple trying to learn how to invest. I told them that index funds and ETFs are way better than mutual funds and individual stocks.  She also said you need money to invest so I told her about Acorns

1558 2018-08-21 12:00:29 Eliminate capital gains, but have a one-time "painless tax".  Charge everyone 20% tax on all accumulated gains.  Stock values will soar +25%.

1575 2018-08-21 11:46:31 The growth is because the corporations have been manipulating the stocks to make it look like they are thriving.  We know they are failing and soon the market will fall and smart Americans know what happens when the market drops.  Hello recession or possible depression!!!

1583 2018-08-21 11:39:33 Interesting article but it relates more to those that are borrowing in order to purchase, if you have a nest egg and would rather invest in property to let out than stocks/shares then although you have to pay higher stamp duty you can still get better returns at less of a risk.
1584 2018-08-21 11:38:42 This is a rule which, if applied in Edinburgh during festival time, would lead to a line of stocks a mile long.
1585 2018-08-21 11:38:01 they probably try to weight higher in stocks with more stable geniuses and lower risk of Sec investigation.

1600 2018-08-21 11:22:58 This fund has some good stocks, but the logic behind investment says some fund not performing well beyond 3 years to its benchmark we should consider switching same. And this fund last beat the benchmark was 4 years ago.
1601 2018-08-21 11:22:52 And by posting this on his RNS it gives him the right to say whatever he wants, and get away with it as in the small print he has admitted that he can make stuff up #prem
1602 2018-08-21 11:20:45 Yes! I was very lucky to get out, but i really hope no one gets sucked into this. The AIM game is hard enough but if investors are highlighted to how george roach opperates at least they wont be sucked into #prem
1603 2018-08-21 11:19:14 By "diversified potfollion" I mean those large enough to insure a large rent through dividends. If you own 3 stocks of 80 different companies, you'll get a few hundred bucks per year: that's nice, but far from enough to garantee an upper-class lifestyle…
1604 2018-08-21 11:18:46 #prem

Trouble with prem is once in you have to wait for a rise in the sp to get out, but george roach is waiting with his finger on the RNS button to use the oppotunity to raise more funds... 

So you have to be very quick...

1662 2018-08-21 10:23:19 A piece of advice : When rockets fly, sky isn't the limit but fuel is, don't try and short the stocks/Nifty that are going up, you are adding the fuel to rocket rising up to limitless sky.

1664 2018-08-21 10:17:45 #Brexit / #EU - an important point; in this age of processing items 'Just-In-Time', Brexit will affect those reliant on fast delivery not only of perishable goods, but lean stocks to control costs?  Having to store larger quantities will kill profit.

1680 2018-08-21 10:06:01 The only piece of advice I can tell you is to invest in stocks , not derivates ( futures , options, CFD, etc ...) those are destructive weapons as Wareen Buffett says . I lost a lot of money years ago investing with warrants and futures . Now exclusively stocks . And $STUDY
1681 2018-08-21 10:05:19 I would disagree with you, as in my opinion businesses don't invest in hiring or R&D, because they do not want to that, instead they often focus on stock purchases. A rule hat tax gains have to be invested in furthering the company's future, not its stocks would be necessary.

1688 2018-08-21 09:58:44 I have been trading for almost 20 years , since .com but not all the time .

1695 2018-08-21 09:53:51 Trap investors? Penny stocks are high risk and what price was a trap? Trading and investing takes a lot of strategy in pennies. The price today is close to the 1 year low. If you bought at $1 and did not sell any at $5 who is to blame? If one buys after a 500% increase in 1 month

1967 2018-08-21 05:03:31 More so it's utilizing the cash vs burning it on purchasing a depreciating asset.

$25k cash for a car vs $20k invested ($5k down), you could match or beat the interest on the loan/lease instead of tying it all up.

$20k in stocks or a rental property is a solid move.

2016 2018-08-21 04:10:51 It has been my experience that MFs also carry large risks. Some MFs stick to certain stocks with little rationale for those investments. 25 lakhs is a decent cutoff even for so many HNIs. If revised will drive some retail to trading/ speculation and raise their risk.
2017 2018-08-21 04:10:45 Tax cuts were wrong but the left needs to get intellectually honest (or just informed) here. MANY middle class people will get cuts they can feel. And ppl who owns stocks (half the country)n benefits from the buybacks. Think you guys seriously discount how popular cuts will be

2024 2018-08-21 04:07:07 Good for you. I’m with you. However, we should acknowledge that only 52% of Americans own stocks. The vast majority of the absolute gains have gone to the 1%.
2025 2018-08-21 04:06:42 What are you doing in a 52 week low? Buy stocks this way.

2029 2018-08-21 04:02:27 I think the key to being an expert on stocks is waiting till a stock pops and then come on TV or send a tweet on how you bought it the day before

2148 2018-08-21 02:17:18 I think since taxes are so popular i think i should atleast get the stocks i bought along with everyone else who owns and understands the stock bonds like most accountants.
2149 2018-08-21 02:17:12 Gee, I wonder why Paizo stocks are down
2150 2018-08-21 02:17:04 I mean Daniel had the real answer: 

When you trade stocks or whatever, there’s a record for every time you buy and sell. This record is kept with your broker/custodian/someone important.

Why do u say stocks are harmful? Also, with ETF models free on internet why would one hire an ETF advisor for asset mgmt?

2190 2018-08-21 01:51:36 "Buy these silver coins" commercial asks, "if you can't hold it [physically], do you really own it?"

Yes. Can't "hold" land, a house, or stocks.
No. Holding things doesn't mean you own them either.

2191 2018-08-21 01:51:18 That's mischaracterization. County made general projection based on past revenues. But, impending cap gains rate cut may have led some to hold off on selling assets. IMO, they may also have decided to hold on to stocks because of run-up in the market. They didn't withhold taxes.

2202 2018-08-21 01:41:12 Asian stocks were capped and the dollar dipped on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies and said he was "not thrilled" with the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates.
2203 2018-08-21 01:40:02 Beyond premium issue, I also think that hedges should only be held with a clear purpose. In this case, it would have to be to remove Chinese Beta risk while wanting to maintain alpha risk on individual stocks. However, in my case, I'm not holding them for alpha over Chinese Beta.

2214 2018-08-21 01:22:14 Index PE is being questioned for index valuations. The point being made is that stocks with high PEs can see PE de-rating and hence difficult to get high returns at these high valuations. Pharma and IT are classic examples of what happens when you invest at high PEs as in 2015.

2272 2018-08-21 00:39:13 Yes, we have a debt driven economy.  But if stocks trade for 30% less, this doesn't reduce the reliance on debt.  The individuals who rely on debt tend to have little or no exposure to stocks.
2273 2018-08-21 00:35:27 i suggest everyone start buying any type of stocks that have to do with the Marajuana industry this shits about to blow the fuck up
2274 2018-08-21 00:35:02 Man, stocks could push higher in this historic bull market, before they reach a peak, or this could be intermission, but no one can tell because of the age. With markets this old, there are usually accidents and they become unpredictable.
2275 2018-08-21 00:35:02 So Instead of buying marijuana, I’ve bought marijuana stocks and invested money into marijuana. Finally, drugs are paying me back!
2276 2018-08-21 00:34:13  i already know about natal charts girl im talking bout the stocks!!
2277 2018-08-21 00:33:24 See the problem is that most people have 401ks and don't even know what they invest  their whole life savings in. that's amazing. And then blame the evil Wall Street bankers when the market tanks why don't you research and pick stocks yourself?

2279 2018-08-21 00:32:45 Can you please do a video chart analysis. $ROKU Thank you in advance
2280 2018-08-21 00:30:33 This market is not much different from stocks - only the lack of historical data and the psychology driving it is different.  But MM still exist, even in here.
2281 2018-08-21 00:29:45 Let's hope it stocks dictionaries!
2282 2018-08-21 00:29:10 you should be able to find yerbas at your local grocery store i.e. Safeway/Lucky’s . 7Eleven actually stocks Yerba Mate but it’s not Guayaki
2283 2018-08-21 00:28:50 That's why Facebook and Twitter are backtracking. They lose big advertising dollars. It's only a matter of time before Conservative sites steal away 50 percent of their dollars . ie stocks down . Then came the I'm sorry it was the BAD ALGORITHM
2284 2018-08-21 00:27:11 Wow. Stocks are FLYING through the roof because DONALD J. TRUMP just convinced the EU to a zero tariff agreement! That’s what happens when your president stands up to unfair trade deals! @realDonaldTrump
2285 2018-08-21 00:26:11 You think it's dangerous trading oversold stocks? What do you recommend for begginers?
2286 2018-08-21 00:25:49 Parce qu'ils font des stocks !

2287 2018-08-21 00:24:20 I didn't enter $KL stocks cause it was oversold. I entered because of fundamentals way before but unfortunately started to go down. Didn't realize gold  had such an impact on $kl's stock price. I’m european and therefore never traded on American/Canadian Companies.
2288 2018-08-21 00:21:06 White cheddar Cheese-Its own all. Want goldfish, preschool stocks them in bulk
2289 2018-08-21 00:19:53 Employee is selling now. Stocks down a lot. Good for next days to load it up. I'm waiting too
2290 2018-08-21 00:19:53 Mdr j'ai soutenu très légèrement en vrai tu devrais augmenter les prix ou les stocks pour te faire de l'oseille, je suis sur que t'as rien rentabiliser la :(
2291 2018-08-21 00:18:26 Yes, best thing to come out of this whole sorry ongoing saga. But NZ is looking good if this is just the beginning. If I was Turnbull, I'd simply declare an election. Let Dutton build his stocks the proper, respectful way after it if he wants the role of Prime Minister. #libspill
2292 2018-08-21 00:17:29 $wmt will b my focus once I'm done with Chinese stocks...
2293 2018-08-21 00:16:15 I read your fine article and in my opinion there's a glaring omission. Global warming in the coming years will incite extreme weather of droughts and floods—and that's a major negative for owning fertilizer stocks. I formerly owned shares of Agrium, but wasn't keen on the merger.
2294 2018-08-21 00:15:31 The whole fact the syd will have four incompatible rolling stocks blows my.mind a bit, too. But maybe that's aok in rail these days
2295 2018-08-21 00:14:55 This is a parody account? Oh crap, I have some stocks to sell.
2296 2018-08-21 00:13:37 Tuesday : Looks like a mixed open in Asia after stocks in the U.S. nudged closer to a new record and comments by U.S. President Donald Trump weakened the dollar.
2297 2018-08-21 00:12:04 @VanessaCrusse I held onto nflx all day and sold at 331. Let me tell u these stocks have been ripping. Taking turns LOL wish I had 200 contracts.

2301 2018-08-21 00:06:20 Asia stocks are subdued as region fails to take impetus from the positive lead from US and Wall St's 3rd consecutive gain, with underperformance in Japan amid a firmer currency; ASX 200 (Unch), Nikkei 225 (-0.4%), KOSPI (Unch)
2302 2018-08-21 00:04:09 If you don’t study stocks you can’t trade them. If you don’t study women you ain’t gonna date them.
