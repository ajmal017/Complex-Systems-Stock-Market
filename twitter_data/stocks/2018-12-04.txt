10 2018-12-04 23:54:54 Cutting regulations and negotiating better trade terms with china and others will be bullish long term. Short term pain for long term prosperity.  Stocks dip all the time

41 2018-12-04 23:47:59 As everyone is going down you are going up.  How sure are we there is a recession on the horizon?  I remember being 18 two years after the recession buying my first stocks, I was salivating at the opportunity to play a recession the next time it came.
42 2018-12-04 23:47:45 Man, I’m still on the hunt for the BD Velociraptor and (especially) the BD Pteranodon, not to mention all those #DinoRivals. Hoping the Boise, ID Walmart stocks up soon.
43 2018-12-04 23:46:43 When stocks go up, Donnie is so lousy, but when they are down, nothing comes out from his f******* mouth?
44 2018-12-04 23:46:24 I'm a bit of a socialist and sometimes tweet stocks and politics but I agree with most your tweets so you may like mine? @fle_pie is a good person to follow too.
45 2018-12-04 23:46:13 Stocks are a long term gain, invest in solid stocks; banking, energy and big phama.
46 2018-12-04 23:46:00 Who rots the crops and drops the stocks? You know it’s the Tariff Man. Night after night, who tells the lies? Baby, it’s the Tariff Man. #bread
47 2018-12-04 23:45:59 But Obama and the entire Democratic party want to ban guns all together. Personally I don't see a need for bump stocks
48 2018-12-04 23:45:16 We had a two year bull-run and most of it was artificial growth by companies buying their own stocks.  I'm honestly not sure if everyone is ready for this recession but we'll see.
49 2018-12-04 23:44:23 Better gun laws and background checks for one. To stop mass shootings. Bump stocks secondly.
50 2018-12-04 23:44:01 Good stock purchase ideas to get on the Downslide that will go back up up up? Answer below let me know!!

51 2018-12-04 23:44:01 stocks dropped donnie
52 2018-12-04 23:41:37 #stocks Dissing of the significance of the yield curve inversion, which began yesterday, has already ramped up impressively.  Once again, Wall Street "analysis" proves anything but correct, and buy recommendations, which still abound, serve as contrary indicators.
53 2018-12-04 23:41:03 Bank Stocks Were Bruised the Worst in the Sell-Off. Here’s Why.
54 2018-12-04 23:39:37 “I’m so so sorry for your loss!”
“My what? What do you mean?”
“Oh I thought you would have heard about the stocks plummeting by now”
55 2018-12-04 23:39:09 That's what I was thinking  don't the studio have stocks hahahaha
56 2018-12-04 23:39:04 So is Brazil lying about stocks on hand and yields ? Surely not.
57 2018-12-04 23:38:46 $TLRY $CGC $ABC These type of downtrending stocks get many novices into trouble; falling for the never ending hype. Don't let this be you.
58 2018-12-04 23:38:36 Unfortunately we have to pay the EU £10billion a yr. upfront to trade at a loss with them. They are also in charge of our Fish stocks & farming. Countries outside the EU don't demand any of this.
59 2018-12-04 23:37:43 This is the time to buy stocks...if you have money that is 
60 2018-12-04 23:37:40 I am NOT a Trump supporter, (proud Democrat here) and I have stocks so when it drops like this and I think they said (AGAIN) that a recession is coming; freaks me out.  I know it is a roller coaster ride for stocks but Trump is driving it into the ground.
61 2018-12-04 23:37:31 I think he sent out the tweet that crushed stocks today in order to direct attention away from Mueller.
62 2018-12-04 23:37:10 They may outpreform an equity index but not individual winning equities. Finding multibagger stocks is still best way to get wealthy, not bitcoin. sorry
63 2018-12-04 23:37:01 I missed a lot of market upside by moving so much out of stocks after Trump's election...but I also missed a lot of anxiety about days like today (when our brokerage accounts were down 0.3% versus the market's 10X or worse loss).
64 2018-12-04 23:36:50 I'm confused I thought stocks were going down becuase of Interest rate and Tarrifs. But now I'm told they are going down becuase of "Inverted Yield Curve". 

Can't they just go down, does there always have to be a reason why?
65 2018-12-04 23:36:48 Tariff Man . . . and stocks plunge. Lovely. Time to bury that money in the backyard again.
66 2018-12-04 23:36:08 So I got in penny stocks, hope it does me good

76 2018-12-04 23:33:10 I reduced the amount of different stocks. Now just one stick, twice a week, for now. That’s only because Im on a 90 day restriction and can’t sell unless there’s enough $ in my settled cash. But I won’t give up! Thanks for the encouragement

78 2018-12-04 23:31:14 Stocks fell after a tweet by President Trump cast doubt on a truce in the U.S.-China trade war. The S&P 500 dropped more than 2 percent. Above, at the New York Stock Exchange.

84 2018-12-04 23:30:06 1/ Trump lies in order to manipulate the market for political points. Before the election he was getting hammered because his tariffs were killing the stock market. So he lied and said he was about to reach a deal with China. This cause stocks to rise so he looked good.
85 2018-12-04 23:29:37 Who know how to invest in stocks & bonds?
86 2018-12-04 23:28:58 You know what it means.? It means I'll just continue to buy more stocks.  Which I am doing as I eat jerky and offending vegans.
87 2018-12-04 23:28:41 As one who dumped his stocks portfolio in Dec 2016--expecting DT's shenanigans, sooner or later, to effect radical fluxuations, I must, in fairness, point out:
on 1/20/17, the Dow closed at 19827; today's is 25,027--
a 26.2% increase, to my chagrin.
Of course, it's early yet.
88 2018-12-04 23:28:38 Yes
89 2018-12-04 23:28:36 Yeah sure but you can play with fake money. that's a kind of financial literacy. I don't mean they should be teaching about stocks vs bonds and the importance of an IRA.

I don't really see a viable alternative to stocks. Good dividend payers are still way better than toilet paper bonds. I see this more as a rotation than bear market. Price swings feel more like bottoming action, but who knows - def not me.

100 2018-12-04 23:24:59 #tytlive Before @cenkuygur says anything about the Stock Market.
It's not just stocks  over valued that are a problem. The REAL problem is the chance of Bond inversion. That is the market that determines whether there will be another recession soon. It's been right since 1980
101 2018-12-04 23:24:54 Don’t forget Obama and his best friend Marty Nesbit who made millions shorting stocks that Obama was going to destroy pvt schools and coal mining.Also Peter Schweitzer book ,also Obama hired his wife’s best friend to do Obamacare #
102 2018-12-04 23:24:53 Tough call. OPEC+ may agree on cuts that boost the price of oil but if stocks continue lower, which I expect they will, it'll be a drag on oil too. Suffice to say that oil is a coin toss imho. Best guess is higher ST, then down to lower lows.
103 2018-12-04 23:24:34 So the stocks go up because the China/US trade war sounds like it's pausing, then Trump opens his mouth and they "plunge" after barely a day, is that right?

106 2018-12-04 23:23:03 Thanks. Trading is ok I just need to realize when the market is dropping  almost all stocks go with it. Not much is safe.
107 2018-12-04 23:22:33 Just remember: Cheaper stocks are like a tax cut for the American oil man. #Oil
108 2018-12-04 23:22:12 That seems strange to me because the G20 summit just happened and the US just reached a deal with China on lower tariffs. Also, other countries are dealing with their own problems. For example, Mexican stocks are falling because of the desicion to regulate bank transactions.
109 2018-12-04 23:21:24 Stocks, runs like garbage on my mac. The yahoo finance website is much faster. Scroll views don't scroll correctly in the app, while they do in Safari.
110 2018-12-04 23:21:21 Yes, we need the market to come down. I mean, I'm sure you're being sarcastic, but I loved seeing stocks down today.  Some more of this and it will be worth buying into.  Since Trump became president, the market went through the roof.
111 2018-12-04 23:20:52 Have asked same question over the past two years of many I follow on Twitter! Especially after his Twitter attacks on Lockheed, Amazon when stocks tanked!
Maybe you are in a position to do research on this?
112 2018-12-04 23:20:04 This tweet was sponsored by George Soros, he wants avocado stocks to crash the mexican economy, so he can bet against the Peso and make big bucks. This tweet is the start of it, he paid me 150 euro.
113 2018-12-04 23:19:36 Is there any way to check that Trump or members of his circle aren't simply shorting stocks before implementing horrible trade policies to make them tank?

124 2018-12-04 23:12:00 US stocks have plunged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling almost 800 points, as a litany of concerns wiped out the rally in risk assets.
Friday is the US monthly employment report for November.
China's November trade data is due on Saturday.
125 2018-12-04 23:11:47 You do realise that fishing rights are reciprocal, don't you? And you also realise that British fishermen sold their boats to EU businesses, pre CFP, as fish stocks were depleted and they didn't see a future for themselves?
126 2018-12-04 23:11:00 I think we should use similar taste your way more. A broad understanding is needed.

I can blow up or build a house and fuck with stocks to pay for them too but I can't clean. That's the biggest mystery in my world: why do people have cleaning days? Can't they stop buying too?
127 2018-12-04 23:10:56 A good one. Pricing in cuts/ a bull steepeners ain't gonna be good news for stocks imho
128 2018-12-04 23:10:47 Stocks go up and down. It'll work out.

131 2018-12-04 23:08:13 Their constituents voted Democratically to leave but they are not respecting there democratic rights they should be placed in the stocks to see how their constituents feel about them.
132 2018-12-04 23:08:05 A more profitable alternative would be LONG BITCOIN, LONG MERCHANT BANK STOCKS
133 2018-12-04 23:08:05 And exactly how is this Trumps fault? I follow the stocks very closely and this has zero to do with Trump, but I have a feeling everything negative in your life you blame Trump
134 2018-12-04 23:06:45 I moved in a big way into bonds a few weeks ago. But I also bought some cannabis stocks.
135 2018-12-04 23:06:03 Final presentations for my finance class started today and 3/4 groups (including mine) were basically like "yeah so we thought it'd be a good idea to buy weed stocks but I guess not lol"
136 2018-12-04 23:05:33 Yuppers. Hard to cut it any way that looks good lol. Some people marry their stocks I guess (not me)
137 2018-12-04 23:05:17 The value of stocks doesn’t affect income anyway. That’s a function of dividends paid. But it’s really pretty sick that Agent Orange can tank the market with tweets.
138 2018-12-04 23:05:02 World stocks weaker; US sharply lower: US -3.2%; Europe -.8%. Investors realized that Trump's China agreement is just smoke & may not come to fruition. And, it's sinking in that 2019 will be slower GDP-growth & perhaps single-digit eps-growth. Still, today an overreaction.
139 2018-12-04 23:04:31 Seems like the biggest loser here is EA though. Stocks down, game sales down, reputation... well it was already the worst in the industry to begin with. I don't see how anyone, regardless of what side you're on can think this is #winning
140 2018-12-04 23:04:19 Focus on my portfolio of stocks 
141 2018-12-04 23:04:14 Solar stocks surrender yesterday's gains that followed news of the U.S.-China trade truce: SPWR -3.3%, JKS -3.6%, CSIQ -2.9%, SEDG -3.2%, VSLR -2.3%, RUN -3.3%, DQ -4.2%,
142 2018-12-04 23:03:48 Thanks! Was curious if any precedent like those anomolies with stocks and bonds
143 2018-12-04 23:03:27 Im gonna buy stocks into trixies toothpaste
144 2018-12-04 23:03:12 Does government shutdown effect stocks friday? I believe we will shutdown
145 2018-12-04 23:03:06 No they won't! Our economy is artificially high through banking, stocks, services etc NOT our production - we NEED the Customs Union! & the military can frankly go fish!
146 2018-12-04 23:02:41 If the market is closed this won’t effect Disney’s stocks.
147 2018-12-04 23:02:11 Fr? Why would stocks close because of a former presidents death. Is that a normal thing
148 2018-12-04 23:02:03 stocks not where it should be , he just want another year of free challengers
149 2018-12-04 23:01:55 @realDonaldTrump just got served 255 pages - worth dozens of subpoenas - based on his receiving of gifts from foreign entities. Stocks not responding well.
150 2018-12-04 23:01:46 I think they are laying off because they make uncompetitive and unprofitable products. And yes, they are supposed to invest the profits, but in the age of FED cheap money policy, they chose to buy back stocks and artifically increase their earnings. See? It comes back to DC
151 2018-12-04 23:00:57 or someone with influence talking trash about it.
I'm no financial advisor, but I did buy CDN cannabis stocks earlier this year and have learned a lot on this rollercoaster!

152 2018-12-04 23:00:39 Thought of the Day: Longterm the US economy (particularly tech stocks) is an amazing bargain. Buy the dips.
153 2018-12-04 23:00:34 @realDonaldTrump they say the market is going to crash more....and it’s over for stocks. 
154 2018-12-04 22:59:37 @FBNQuest How do i open an account and start investing in stocks?
155 2018-12-04 22:59:17 People get “scared” and sell stocks in response to all kinds of indicators; politics, trade, hearsay, the moon. Who knows
156 2018-12-04 22:58:53 Btw boi stocks have recovered.
157 2018-12-04 22:58:52 The $DOW dropping more than 700 pts today was just an overaction to a trade war that won't really exist in the near future! Look for stocks that got a beating through no fault of their own and buy!!! This is a great opportunity and I am taking advantage of it..
158 2018-12-04 22:58:25 @aphriainc well at least you guys lowered the entire industry so I could buy some cheap stocks today

160 2018-12-04 22:57:07 Do you treat your partner or significant other differently if you've had a particularly hard day at the office, or if there was a bad day in the stock market? I'm curious. #money #stocks #relationships #marriedlife #stress #stressrelief

162 2018-12-04 22:56:34 Thanks Kim, I would've settled with a sweet yes, lol., but thanks for the explanation. and glad I moved all my super out of stocks etc, several months ago. 
163 2018-12-04 22:56:34 Aggressive sellers have pushed stocks into a lower energy configuration - happens all the time - and explained on CNBC. Either that or the buyers refuse to be as agressive today.
164 2018-12-04 22:55:55 They were SO good to us when i started- $30 free shit a month, stocks (that were actually worth a few bucks), wear what we wanted. A goddamn LANYARD for my NAMETAG was all i got for 5 YEARS in the end. Worthless stock, no more perks, and after i left they had to wear uniforms lol
165 2018-12-04 22:55:45 You lie everyday. No one knows the truth. Why did stocks drop 700+ points today?
166 2018-12-04 22:55:40 Ty Lori!
167 2018-12-04 22:55:37 GoPro have stocks why DJI dont have stocks?

Emerging market stocks will have a “more favorable climate” in 2019 thanks to a potentially flat to marginally weak U.S. dollar; relatively better economic growth, earnings and valuations; and rising global capex, Credit Suisse
170 2018-12-04 22:53:44 Stocks dropped 700+ points today.
171 2018-12-04 22:53:37 Yea, and looks like the stock market didn't like it. Nearly 800 pts lost today. Yea, I hope you take credit for this drop like you take credit for great news on stocks.
172 2018-12-04 22:53:31 >.> Ik it isn’t everything but being a pro player and big YTer is slim if you don’t dedicate your life to it and are competing against a lot of ppl that want the same shit but he does have other options like hard labor, entrepreneurship and investing into stocks etc
173 2018-12-04 22:52:52 $MOMO Now that the trade wars are over I think Chinese stocks are starting to look more desirable
174 2018-12-04 22:52:24 Before she was like she has so much money this doesn't make a difference and it's all getting put into stocks anyway.  now she's like this is cold cash and she's  all jacked up about this cause it's not gonna be part of her asset port.  come on
175 2018-12-04 22:51:24 You're not alone. I have some wonderful small cap growth stocks that after 15 years are still small cap. Now they're small cap value stocks 
176 2018-12-04 22:50:55 @realDonaldTrump My God, stocks are down AGAIN! Straighten out this mess!
177 2018-12-04 22:50:38 Someone needs to investigate donald trump to see if he is intentionally crashed the stock market so his associates/family can buy cheap stocks to sell them at a higher price in the future. #Impeach45 #InsiderTrading
178 2018-12-04 22:50:00 How are the stocks doing?
179 2018-12-04 22:49:23 Stocks are down, don't see #Obama taking credit for any of it. Weird, he only loves taking credit when things are going well. 
So dignified of him.

181 2018-12-04 22:48:56 I definitely need to look in to weed stocks 
182 2018-12-04 22:48:53 What about better stocks market
183 2018-12-04 22:48:32 Stocks are closed because of the funeral
184 2018-12-04 22:48:30 Ugh. I’m hoping they make an 18+ tumblr since their stocks ranked yesterday! I have three Tumblr blogs, only one was naughty.
185 2018-12-04 22:48:23 Transport stocks had Worst day since 2016. This economy appears to have a flat. #StockMarket #Economy #BahHumbug
186 2018-12-04 22:48:11 A class you obviously skipped. Actually the "47%" are the creators of jobs. Wealthy horde their money in stocks, bonds, money markets. Those who make under 100k spend their money buying goods and services that in turn create jobs.
187 2018-12-04 22:47:35 KHQLOCALNEWS: RT AP: BREAKING: Stocks close sharply lower as trade jitters rattle investors; Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges nearly 800 points.
188 2018-12-04 22:47:11 Calling himself “Tariff Man” was a little corny.  But they do work. For the first time China is dealing seriously with American concerns regarding commerce. Unlike previous administrations who were treated like laughing stocks and the butt of jokes.
189 2018-12-04 22:46:37 He thinks our stocks are like golf. Low score wins, and it doesn’t matter if he cheats.
190 2018-12-04 22:46:19 Yeah but different mkt sizes obviously. So when the S&P 500 rises 3% in a day, you'll say us stocks made more money than all of crypto combined?
191 2018-12-04 22:46:11 Stocks had a 800 point drop on same day as  this Tumblr nonsense
192 2018-12-04 22:46:02 Let China  go broke.  Their Stocks are in a nose dive.  Let the country crash and burn and then trade with them.

201 2018-12-04 22:40:40 @NaijaFlyingDr I was really inspired by your speech during the #yeep2018. You are doing something truly amazing. I followed you cause you said you post about the stocks you invest in so I'll be waiting
202 2018-12-04 22:40:35 Here's a couple of stocks I picked earlier D............
203 2018-12-04 22:39:47 The DOW dropped 3% today after Trump's "Tariff Man" comment. I don't know enough about the stocks to know if that had an effect, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
204 2018-12-04 22:39:40 I sold the stocks I needed to on Friday. Suck on it, you people who are slightly poorer than me.
205 2018-12-04 22:39:39 The capital gains tax rate incentivizes living off stocks instead of working for those who have a choice. We’re subsidizing the lazy rich. Same with getting rid of the estate tax.
206 2018-12-04 22:38:26 "Stocks slide as Trump says something else completely idiotic and wrong".
207 2018-12-04 22:38:20 U.S. stocks closes far lower Tuesday 12/04/2018. $DJIA -3.10% at 25,027.07, $SPX -3.24% at 2,700.06, $COMPQ -3.80% at 7,158.43, $RUT -4.40% at $1480.75.
208 2018-12-04 22:38:05 The daughter of an investing friend of mine told him she was going to take a chunk of money and buy pot stocks. We tried to talk her out of it on Sunday.

209 2018-12-04 22:37:36 Stocks are kinda interesting once you learn about it
210 2018-12-04 22:37:28 YEAH WTF! The overall premise of the app is to have a blog that you post/repost cute pics and that’s not an adult only concept...it’s not like it’s a website to buy fucking stocks and bonds, 15 year olds should be allowed to reblog some god damn mountains and deep quotes and shit
211 2018-12-04 22:37:13 Stocks drop 800 points on his trade war/tariff tweet. How long ?
212 2018-12-04 22:36:54 Time to buy when the stocks are low

223 2018-12-04 22:32:58 I do not support the NRA, nor have I ever supported the NRA. As for the NRA winning, membership has been going down, if I recall correctly, likely in no small part because they supported bans on bump stocks among other compromises.

225 2018-12-04 22:32:15 It's great, I can create a bot which uses sentiment analysis to predict which stocks I should short
226 2018-12-04 22:31:51 How do you figure? Obviously if they are long term stocks such as amazon which most likely will be above $2,000 next year then they aren’t losing money. People see a decline one day and panic. Long term investors who know what they are doing tend not to panic
227 2018-12-04 22:31:30 Fears of Brexit problems also weighs on U.S. Stocks today.
228 2018-12-04 22:31:08 Worst year for stocks in quite a while!
229 2018-12-04 22:30:49 @markminervini Reading through your book and you've clearly built an amazing career in the market. What's your take on options? Do you ever trade them? Even as a way to hedge? Or stick strictly to stocks..thanks as always.
230 2018-12-04 22:30:12 US pot stocks lack institutional investment and involve real cash registers.  All the Latin America transactions and IP deals will continue to get hammered by shorts.
231 2018-12-04 22:29:49 Instead of them getting deals,immunity,retirement,the House,Bump stocks and our free speech....Just saying.

236 2018-12-04 22:28:53 Stocks fall because the president lied about the situation.
237 2018-12-04 22:28:51 with three minutes left in the office hours of the history department, the most exciting thing to happen today was clardy complaining about the stocks

239 2018-12-04 22:28:16 Stocks Update: $SPY $QQQ $DOW fell today, but we are not selling because:

1) Yield Curve Inversion” has historically proceeded stock market peaks by 3-18 months

2) Trump or Fed could easily reverse risk-off sentiment. Cosmetic not systemic. Very different from housing bubble.
240 2018-12-04 22:27:44 And this post just now on CNBC twitter feed. “Stocks plunge may have been a too fearful reaction to trade, economic worries”
241 2018-12-04 22:27:39 Non-US stocks, Emerging market stocks, non-US small caps all down > 10% total return on the year.

252 2018-12-04 22:24:29 I've kept some $ tucked away for when the market really crashes so I can go in & buy up less expensive stocks... bcs they tend to rebound in a few days. So yeah, maybe I'm profiting off DT's idiotic rantings, but I may as well use it to my advantage since my IRA has taken a hit.
253 2018-12-04 22:24:29 - The stocks suffered a meltdown
- Economic growth is slowing
- 33 people have been indicted in the Mueller probe
- His long-time lawyer, friend, and "fixer-upper" just pled guilty
- Democrats are about to take control of the House

When's all this winning going to start, Donald?
254 2018-12-04 22:24:11 There are so many factors that can affect...  Are you referring to the greater stock market as a whole, stocks within a specific sector (i.e. energy), or an individual stock?
255 2018-12-04 22:23:04 Russian you say
256 2018-12-04 22:23:03 I’m ignorant when it comes to stocks and which ones to care about.. Typically stock drops are bad.. Is the Dow dropping one to worry about?  Ik its the stock I hear most frequently about, so this isn’t good right? Dumb question ik lol
257 2018-12-04 22:22:07 The biggest culprits in selloff had nothing to do with fundamentals 
-Trump trade tweet (the admin working on deal that's only news)
-Yield Inversion (signals recession in two years)
-Technicals (key resistance held triggered selling)
-Hard Brexit News
-Momentum Stocks Plunge
258 2018-12-04 22:22:05 *Facebook stocks down 50%*

260 2018-12-04 22:21:09 for a hot minute i was really invested in the process of understanding stocks for the purpose of roasting tumblr+verizon before i remembered that it’s kinda boring and also a weird flex when u can just say “site bad just look at it” instead
261 2018-12-04 22:21:08 Assumption is that Call buyers know something others don't. May be 'an' indication on thinly traded stocks, less so on very liquid mega caps and certainly not so on large indexes. My .02
262 2018-12-04 22:20:52 Big down day for the markets... received about 15 messages from my financial websites telling me that certain stocks were trading below normal ranges... Traders locking in positions before the close tomm?  I'll have my eye on a few div stocks on Thurs! #invest #dividend #stocks
263 2018-12-04 22:20:20 So, I do day trading with stocks and every time the stock market tumbles more, people are like “Rough day, huh?”. 

Uhmmm, no. It would have been if I was invested in long term stocks (Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, etc), but I’m not. So no, not a rough day for me.
264 2018-12-04 22:19:33 Is there a market for requiring Theresa May impersonators…?

Ah silly me, of course there’s a lot of scope for her to get put in stocks around the country. D’uh

268 2018-12-04 22:17:15 They don't hurt the smart people who buy quality stocks when short sellers crash the markets.Always winners and losers
269 2018-12-04 22:16:42 Stock markets are not a lot better than binary options nowadays

270 2018-12-04 22:16:19 U.S. stocks are battered in one of their worst days of 2018 as U.S.-China trade deal appears to sputter
271 2018-12-04 22:16:11 Last month, when the stocks were doing great, you said it was all Obamas' doing.
272 2018-12-04 22:16:04 Funny but my OTC stocks were all pretty much green today too. Most dont realize that amidst big board carnage even in bad markets or recession OTCs can still perform! LoveMyOtcs & ready to buck any downward big board trends over comin months & yrs! All bout %s! Oh & #STAYPUTHEAVY
273 2018-12-04 22:15:38 How much were the stocks individually worth when you bought them?
274 2018-12-04 22:15:23 Jig is up w/ the clown show in the Whitehouse. #Trump trade deal truce w/ China was another lie! Wall Street is finally tiring of him. Good Obama #economy Trump inherited is ending. Now companies are laying off people, stocks lower, interest rates higher, CEOs are turning on him.
275 2018-12-04 22:15:08 Layoffs reduce companies liabilities when revenues fall and stocks sell off - making credit ratings a risk category. Only a foolish worker would think not a problem for me
276 2018-12-04 22:15:07 @CNBCFastMoney winter is here. What natural gas company stocks should I buy?
277 2018-12-04 22:14:59 Today the Dow went down,  tomorrow  it will go up buying  those stocks  that went down.
Analysts  have no idea yet are paid millions to guess.
278 2018-12-04 22:14:58 Sell in January because things will get hairy
Risk off February, things will get scary
Don't buy in March, stocks will arch
No stocks April, bonds are a staple
Sell in May etc.
Never buy in June, you buffoon!
Sell in July when stocks are high

Basically nvr hold stocks. It rhymes
279 2018-12-04 22:14:33 @msttrader I use your techniques for trading and I've had strong results August to mid October but I've had poor results in November. I was just shaken out of $F and $MCHP today. Do you have any suggestions for stocks/sectors that are unaffected by current market volatility?
280 2018-12-04 22:14:07 Most of them probably don’t own any Stocks.
281 2018-12-04 22:14:07 What we did was 0 all stocks and invest in tangible assets. Zeroed mortgages. Rental properties. Etc... The stock market is beyond dangerous and most people's 401ks are nothing but a convenient fiction. I'm actually surprised it's not MORE volatile.
282 2018-12-04 22:14:06 Cathy Wood is arguing a yield curve inversion is good for stocks and different this time because of 'disruptive innovation'. 

$ARKW $TSLA $NVDA
283 2018-12-04 22:13:50 Imagine Trump owns stocks. Pretend he knows the market can tumble bc of his words/ actions. Maybe he sells stocks the day b4 these KNOWING market will drop and buys them back when it does...
284 2018-12-04 22:13:46 I am getting ready to dump stocks to payoff vacation home,before stocks drop big time.
285 2018-12-04 22:13:23 After more than 9y it seems the #bull super cycle in #stocks comes to an end. #2019 will be tough.
286 2018-12-04 22:13:19 Dow Jones crashing. Chinese stocks up. What does this tell you “Tariff Man”?
287 2018-12-04 22:12:21 where do you trade stocks?
288 2018-12-04 22:12:11 Stocks are down and jobs are not keeping up with inflation. BTW the recovery started under Obama. Trump's job and stock performance does not compare favorably to Obama's.
289 2018-12-04 22:12:02 - Flattening Treasury yield curve helps bring down global stocks - Ederson 10-year yield falls to lowest…
290 2018-12-04 22:11:34 I am guessing the recently update marketcap of #XRP from @ForbesCrypto, @YahooFinance, @Apple stocks & @LiveCoinWatch is wrong and you are right? or is it the other way around?!?
291 2018-12-04 22:10:56 This is the official (Please let @dogbitedog2 ) loose on the threads of @HotCopper #Poll , I need the entertainment while no stocks bleed Red My vote 100% YES !
292 2018-12-04 22:10:48 Dow dropped almost 800 points as U.S. stocks had their worst day is nearly 2 months

“We’re going to win. We’re going to win so much. We’re going to win at trade, we’re going to win at the border. We’re going to win so much, you’re going to be so sick and tired of winning,” 
293 2018-12-04 22:10:47 yeah man. im going through charts right now. I think I saw this kind of damage the Sunday before 911. My main watch has over 100 stocks. The Mern 100, had 4 greens and two of those were short based vehicles.
294 2018-12-04 22:10:46 tech stocks, pot stocks, crypto, student loan debt, human population, etc.
295 2018-12-04 22:10:02 Market Close: MBS +8bps; DOW -799.36; NASDAQ -283.09;  S&P 500 -90.31; 10yr Treasury 2.92%; Stocks completely tanked on concerns over drop in Yields & Fed Rate Hikes, which will lead to an Inverted Yield Curve.  Markets will be closed tomorrow, so no reports to report ;)
296 2018-12-04 22:09:59 Let's you've added $1.5Trillion to Govt debt with your #TaxCutScam and wiped $800 Billion off of stocks. Time to resign I'd say, your #shitheadOnomics ain't #MAGA that's for sure..
297 2018-12-04 22:09:49 Fail is a process back in 1929. It took 1 1/2yrs for stocks be 90% down.
Now worries modern folk we have 1 ~ 3 Quadrillion derivatives dump the system faster.  Seems everyone in modern age wants instant service.
Ta'Da!
Any articles today of the Deutsche bank?
298 2018-12-04 22:09:46 The investment course he gives is about how to implement these principles. His advice, which is counter to what most people teach, is to find stocks that are at 52 week highs and trending up. Keep them if they keep rising, dump them if they drop. It's very interesting stuff.
299 2018-12-04 22:09:30 Likely short covering to reduce margin on a terrible day for most other stocks. Not a TSLA strength.
300 2018-12-04 22:09:21 question those that have been to taboo etc (not to say you may not have done this) but if you had bought shares. stocks, bonds etc with the money spent there - or even on black business would you be better or worse off? #AskingForAFriend #ChairmansConversation #RupertOnPOWER
301 2018-12-04 22:09:06 I’m sorry. That’s stocks. Not market.
302 2018-12-04 22:08:22 Not to mention housing stocks and the stock market in general is tanking. I have a suspicion that the recession we are about to see may mean that we no longer need about 95% of trade builders.
303 2018-12-04 22:08:18 It really feels like Powell and Trump telegraphed or tweeted fake messages to Market that Rates won't be raised much any time soon & Trade war with China is ending soon in 90 days just to help fund managers unload Billions of dollars worth of stocks funds before 2019 recession.
304 2018-12-04 22:08:11 Where are the bubbles?   Government spending and Treasury yields.  Certainly not stocks, housing, consumer spending, etc.
305 2018-12-04 22:08:09 To all $crypto haters:
Don't you wish you were invested in #crypto today instead of #stocks? 
$BTCUSD $ETHUSD $Dow $NASDAQ
306 2018-12-04 22:07:33 It’s still good. Everyone else (Wall Street brokers etc) are praising it for him. Jobs up, stocks up. The man could shit gold bouillon and you all would gripe the shape is wrong
307 2018-12-04 22:07:21 The headline: "Stocks Slide After Trump Tweets on Trade, While Bond Market Sounds Recession Warning"
Slides AFTER TRUMP TWEETS on Trade.  Your irresponsible stream of consciousness internet comment have consequences. Action have consequences.
308 2018-12-04 22:07:21 If you know enough to buy and track individual stocks and do it right, you might outperform index funds. Jonathan teaches that the two things you really need to know about any investment is (1) its price and (2) its trend (is it steadily rising, steadily falling, or up and down)?

311 2018-12-04 22:06:37 Spare us and go look at your 401K or stocks..Oh..you don't care that he is stealing it all!!!
312 2018-12-04 22:06:28 Via @AP: Stocks slumped on Wall Street on Tuesday as traders worried that the U.S. and China made less progress than originally thought on defusing their trade dispute. Bond prices surged, sending yields sharply lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 800 points.
313 2018-12-04 22:06:22 It really feels like Powell and Trump telegraphed or tweeted fake messages to Market that Rates won't be raised much any time soon & Trade war with China is ending soon in 90 days just to help fund managers unload Billions of dollars worth of stocks funds before 2019 recession.
314 2018-12-04 22:06:20 The stocks are down 700 points. Who are you kidding?
315 2018-12-04 22:06:02 see mr president hawkish powell has nothing to do with your stocks crashing
316 2018-12-04 22:05:36 I haven't watched financial tv in 3 yrs. It's just noise that clouds reality and sound judgement. Indexes don't concern me much either. On any given day, some stocks go up and some stocks go down.
317 2018-12-04 22:05:29 Hah, so this is why Kang was talking up uranium stocks on @COINTALKSHOW past week…
318 2018-12-04 22:05:22 So, with stocks tumbling today, probably not the best of days to look at your 401K. Yikes
319 2018-12-04 22:04:51 Yesterday - Industry: #ENERGY was 14% Positive, with #REAL ESTATE 3% Positive. Stocks: $IHL was 22% Positive, with $AUZ 1% Positive. #ASX
320 2018-12-04 22:04:42 Love to see how the Trump family members are managing their stocks in advance of the blowhard's statements. Is all this just another way for them to get rich and the rest of us to subsidize that? @WSJ @DowJones @washingtonpost @nytimes
321 2018-12-04 22:04:25 Guess all the Corporate giants he handed out the billions and billions too are now preparing their move to buy the stocks back and greatly reduced prices!  Trump logic once again proves fatal, for the other that Corporate giants
322 2018-12-04 22:04:14 Stocks tumbled Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 800 points, as investors worried that a U.S.-China trade truce reached over the weekend wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
323 2018-12-04 22:03:26 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-04, is 359.7. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
324 2018-12-04 22:03:09 However I will say that AA has a history of selling well ranked or liked prospects before their stocks take a big dive.... Norris, Hoffman, Castro  and several others
325 2018-12-04 22:02:55 I'm not saying they don't need another year.  IMO both of their stocks have dropped.  I just don't see them sticking around.
326 2018-12-04 22:02:46 Think of how easy it would be to monetize the Trump presidency by warning certain friends when he was about to say something stupid on Twitter like “I’m a tariff man” and then short-selling certain stocks...
327 2018-12-04 22:02:40 I meant stocks buy today before they go up tomorrow after the 90 day tariff treaty was announced. The market was crashing hard today. That will get companies through the end of the year so that they can make their financial statements look good.
328 2018-12-04 22:02:34 Stocks tumbled Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 800 points, as investors worried that a U.S.-China trade truce reached over the weekend wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
329 2018-12-04 22:02:30 Neither have I, but from seeing what happened in past bear markets like 2008 yes another 15-20% haircut atleast on indexes could easily be in the works, all stocks will get hammered regardless how good they are. Will be some great buy opportunities when it’s all over
330 2018-12-04 22:02:25 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-12-04, is 342.84. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
331 2018-12-04 22:02:21 Think of how easy it would be to monetize the Trump presidency by warning certain friends when he was about to say something stupid on Twitter like “I’m a tariff man” and then short-selling certain stocks...
332 2018-12-04 22:02:09 Gold and silver stocks
333 2018-12-04 22:01:44 It's double dipping in a way when the stocks are higher than your init investment sell those off, then cause panic sell off (other people start dumping stock before they think they're losing money) then buy back your initial investment plus devalued stock. Similar to inside trade
334 2018-12-04 22:01:30 Yeah and she's so humble. Let me share an instance. We were at jaipur in 2009-10, don't remember exactly tbh, holidaying there. One of local jpr friend told me about Cnbc investor camp on that Sunday morning,in shereton jpr, we went there. Met udayan and her. We talked stocks.
335 2018-12-04 22:01:10 That’s not happening JT.  That’s fear mongering, like a demagogue.  It’s disingenuous, and in bad faith.  Democrats want to preserve legal gun ownership with common sense refs. Just not stupid paramilitary style weapons like ARs, with silencers and bump stocks.  That ok with you?
336 2018-12-04 22:01:01 Duh - "sell in July when stocks are high." Everyone knows that.
337 2018-12-04 22:00:58 Je me rends compte que j'ai peu de respectful même sur mon portable
Du coup envoyez moi vos stocks svp
338 2018-12-04 22:00:42 i still have no clue how stocks work
339 2018-12-04 22:00:42 Stock drop: $BNED and 213 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #BNED
340 2018-12-04 21:59:49 799.36 at closing!!!  Makes me glad we don't own any stocks.
341 2018-12-04 21:59:24 Do you subscribe to Bill O Neil's holding of only a few stocks at a time or do you just take as many set ups and breakouts that become available as long as you are managing risk?
342 2018-12-04 21:58:57 It seems like when the stock market is down,my OTC stocks are up. My portfolio closed up 11% today!Everything either stayed at the opening price/went up; nothing went down for the day!I wonder if that's typical for the OTC. It's been my experience generally for the past 1 1/2 yrs
343 2018-12-04 21:58:28 Amen brother!  DJT has egg on his face, and I get to take my last trip to the stocks store during the “everything is 40% off!” sale. Win win
344 2018-12-04 21:58:22 Stocks tumbled Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 800 points, as investors worried that a U.S.-China trade truce reached over the weekend wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
345 2018-12-04 21:58:05 @sportsrage @CamStewartLive  I'm a hypocrite lol.  I hate Nike's child labor practices but not gonna lie I'll wear their shoes cause I like them and I'll buy their stocks if it can make me a buck
346 2018-12-04 21:57:48 I mean nou standard bank is involved in a corruption scandal but the media isn’t reporting about it because they don’t want their stocks to fall,what kind of nonsense is this?othef banks are probably involved in the same scandal but now they won’t be exposed
347 2018-12-04 21:57:14 jesus i hope i don't have any stocks
348 2018-12-04 21:57:13 Signed up for UO with 10% off. Received an email but promo code was left blank. No code given. I've had to place £80 order as stocks low.... are you going to refund me my 10% please? @UrbanOutfitters
349 2018-12-04 21:56:58 Passing C and A Stocks gave it more variety and were prettier IMO 
350 2018-12-04 21:56:43 Watch this time it will still be bad for stocks lmaffooooooooo
351 2018-12-04 21:56:27 The Magats dont own stocks or have jobs. As long as big pharma keeps pushing oxy their way, and Trump feeds them a daily dose of MAGA, they feel like their winning 
352 2018-12-04 21:56:18 I am beginning to think that these people are too stupid to know they are the #TrumpCrimeFamily. Our stocks crashed today. Layoffs like crazy happening. Soybeans rotten. #MAGA MY ASS
353 2018-12-04 21:55:51 What a disgusting individual. I hope they catch her soon. Bring back the stocks!
354 2018-12-04 21:55:42 For sure!   And my pot stocks took a hit today.  Not happy!!!
355 2018-12-04 21:55:40 Yep just like this little fella , "we all gona be rich !"  ( oh no you ain't! )
356 2018-12-04 21:55:17 So many big-name stocks down more than 5% today. Here are a few:

$NVDA -7.6%
$UPS -7.4
BestBuy $BBY -7.1
Caterpillar $CAT -6.9
$GE -6.8
Deere $DE -6.6
$AMZN -5.9
SunTrust $STI -5.8
$AIG -5.6
Macy's $M -5.6
Schwab $SCHW -5.4
BankAmerica $BAC -5.4
$NFLX -5.2
$GM -5.0

vs S&P -3.2%
357 2018-12-04 21:55:15 I focus only on DJIA, S&P and NDX ETFs. Indiv stocks can buck the trend at times and indices easier to read due to mass emotion. That's just me tho - everyone different. Don't get greedy and don't fret missing something.
358 2018-12-04 21:55:05 I get what you're saying but there's plenty of light top tiers and he has ways to prolong his stocks where other characters wouldn't.
359 2018-12-04 21:54:58 Signed up for UO with 10% off. Received an email but promo code was left blank. No code given. I've had to place £80 order as stocks low.... are you going to refund me my 10% please?
360 2018-12-04 21:54:35 Make Stocks Great Again
361 2018-12-04 21:53:38 I love penny stocks and all but a lot of times the traders have me SMH I mean there was zero reasons why this traded below the 200 DMA to close the day 
It took under 1 Million shares to bring it from .0165-.0133 I mean give me a damn break lol
Major accumulation going on here
362 2018-12-04 21:53:37 More than half of S&P 500 stocks are down over 20%. Other than FANG, it’s been a disaster. Stocks are leading indicators. We’ll have a negative job print by July.
363 2018-12-04 21:52:35 He's probably invested in marijana stocks w/ his old sensei John Boenhner.
364 2018-12-04 21:52:27 Depends on the stock. Twitter / facebook / most banking stocks = sell. 
Aluminum and steel production with good reports would be buys.
New emerging tech companies with clear path to success = buy.
I really like New IPO's. Alibaba was the last one that I followed.
365 2018-12-04 21:52:19 I just saw @ntengler on @CNBC talking bullish about stocks when all signs point to a bear market.  She said her firm will be buying stocks tomorrow.  

Nancy, the market is closed tomorrow.  Also, I think your optimism proves that the selling isn't over yet. #ContrarianIndicator
366 2018-12-04 21:52:01 Congrats! Tariff talk, 800 poi t Dow drop, stocks now negative for the year.
367 2018-12-04 21:52:00 Time to buy stocks in preserved food bins.
368 2018-12-04 21:51:41 Yes just stocks, bonds and cme futs on them
369 2018-12-04 21:51:27 I bet old Bernie boy has stocks in some great green companies just like Al Gore.
Now, if we can just force people to buy them...
370 2018-12-04 21:50:48 When Mike Pondsmith chips in, the stocks for both Intel and PepsiCo climb by 300 points. #mikepondsmithfacts
371 2018-12-04 21:50:18 Back in the day, 2013-2015 i was part of ross chat. Back then it was free. But as more people got into the chatroom it became hard to not move the stocks once he called them out. I dont think he's a scam, but his style is not methodical. More of scalping breakouts for .10 or so
372 2018-12-04 21:50:06 Stocks fell again today, nearly 3% ... #MAGA supporters/@GOP, in all seriousness, where is the winning? Please point me to the specific examples in which the "stable genius" @realDonaldTrump has steered us for the win?
373 2018-12-04 21:49:12 No we said he would win and stocks would go up lol. But ok lol
374 2018-12-04 21:49:08 what's that really really old saying, if the shoe shine boy is giving stock advice it's time to get out of stocks? I feel that this applies.   Recession imminent.
375 2018-12-04 21:48:54 @Howie18123 I checked to see if comcast carried CNBC and they do, but the problem is its all about stocks. I'm excited that Deal No Deal is coming back.
376 2018-12-04 21:48:36 Shouldn't that read "U.S. stocks are battered in one of their worst days in history as U.S.-China trade deal appears to sputter"? I mean, yeah, it was one of the worst trading days of 2018, but also, it was a historically bad day.
377 2018-12-04 21:47:57 It's the Fed's fault when stocks decline. Trump only takes credit when it goes up 
378 2018-12-04 21:47:54 CNBC headline about a week ago, "Cramer Volatility charts suggest now is the time to buy stocks." #Dow today -800. How does the old saying go, "buy headlines and you'll end up selling newspaper."
379 2018-12-04 21:47:44 You'd think the financial community would know what they're getting themselves into with this uber ipo , but they don't , it's like the village drunk selling iou's in the pub to go on the lash & no one suspects a thing , all are buying into it
380 2018-12-04 21:47:29 So Trump said he's a Tariff man and stocks plunge. It seems this happens whenever he opens his big mouth. He said he's going to go after China with high Tariff's. The problem here is someone will have to pay for these high Tariff's and I can tell you, It won't be the Chinese.
381 2018-12-04 21:47:28 30 years of appeasing foreign nations and subsidizing their growth by holding corporate tax rates high and allowing them to hold tariffs high had to come to an end.  How do you propose to deal with that?  1.2% gain in Dow this year vs 9% drop in Euro stocks.  What toxicity?
382 2018-12-04 21:47:18 FANG stocks got crushed today.
Time to look at value stocks??
383 2018-12-04 21:47:12 Stocks down by 800 today. The banks on the world stage are built with match sticks and bottom floor is smoking.

#DowJones #MarketWatch
384 2018-12-04 21:46:54 Trump tweets "MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN"; stocks plunge
385 2018-12-04 21:46:48 @realDonaldTrump hey #MAGA..crashed market..jobs lost...stocks now negative ytd..farmers lost millions and you had to pay their subsidies (welfare)..defecit out of control....are you tired of winning yet?

387 2018-12-04 21:46:32 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your insomnia

391 2018-12-04 21:45:30 Ayy boi, my stocks down 3% because of you.
392 2018-12-04 21:44:52 I don't see that perspective. Is he complaining having too much in stocks and thus having too little?
393 2018-12-04 21:44:15 His cult ignores it because they don’t own stocks. A 700 drop means nothing to them.
394 2018-12-04 21:44:06 RT brendanclark: NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks close sharply lower as trade jitters rattle investors; Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges nearly 800 points. WCBD
395 2018-12-04 21:44:00 The fine line between trading and investing. If solid DD is done & your stock falls due to other sources then just hold/invest.. Since when was investing in growth stocks smooth? Oh .. we live in a time of instant gratification.....
396 2018-12-04 21:43:48 One of the only few stocks to remain green in today's correction was $TSLA. 

Once again proving that Ponzi schemes are the best investment ever.
397 2018-12-04 21:43:21 And now stocks have fallen and the bond market is sounding a recession warning, thanks to your complete lack of understanding about macroeconomics. Great job, Moron! You owe my husband for devaluing his Wharton degree. (And owe the country for... everything.)
398 2018-12-04 21:42:45 If I KNEW a recession or bear market was coming, I would not buy individual stocks and use the "Stay and Pray" technique.  I'd simply get in $SQQQ or $SPXS and make money while the market sells off for months and even years.  Very few stocks are spared in a bear market/recession.
399 2018-12-04 21:42:43 Next time send me a txt first so i can sell my stocks like your buddies before the market crashes! Trying to make a living on firefighter pay thanks! I voted for you and now im getting sour
400 2018-12-04 21:42:36 Irrespective I think we have to watch stocks. Personal experience with essar, il&fs,, Bajaj hind.
401 2018-12-04 21:41:34 No; #stocks finally reacting to the obvious realities:
43% of recent college grads now underemployed ("Fortune" August).
GM just downsized a whole small town of good-wage jobs.
402 2018-12-04 21:41:25 The 2 yr to 5 year has inverted. The yield curve is the uber indicator of where stocks are going. It never fails.
403 2018-12-04 21:41:13 Anyone is right if they trash Trump. Lol. This Conway is another Trump wannabe. I am still@looking for the stocks from yesterday Dow up 600+. Fake news media
404 2018-12-04 21:40:55 Nope. But what is funny - BMW stocks exploded. Trump made it
405 2018-12-04 21:40:18 I suspect if he accepted more advice the stocks would do better, we wouldn't have such a hard time defending him, and people wouldn't believe he was 'literally Hitler'.  But we take the bad with the good.
406 2018-12-04 21:39:41 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
407 2018-12-04 21:39:40 Freakin THANK YOU! I get so tired of reading headlines like “Stocks Slide on China Fears” and “Stocks Rise as China Fear Subsides.” 
408 2018-12-04 21:39:33 4:18 PM : Stocks have ended the day sharply lower. The Dow closed 799.36 at 25,027.07 and the S&P 500 closed -90.31 at 2,700.06. Mortgage Bonds are +9bp at 100.92.
409 2018-12-04 21:38:30 Man, CNBC today. Is the drop cause of yield curve? Powell and the Fed? Trade confusion? LOL- no. It was because Trump lied on the week-end and stocks gained Monday. The lie unravelled and they gave it back today.
410 2018-12-04 21:38:22 i really want to buy NVDA stocks, I am just not sure if the price correction is over
411 2018-12-04 21:38:14 Stocks have done good but then all the gains for the year got wiped out but to be fair someone should have told him not to make the same mistake Obama did by making comments on stocks.
412 2018-12-04 21:37:54 Stocks going down now due to trumponomics auto factories shutting down, people not buying and cost of cars increased average of $4000 each due to trump tariffs
413 2018-12-04 21:37:49 If you wanted to be accurate you would say the yield curve sent stocks plummeting.
414 2018-12-04 21:37:36 also, Loaf are doing a special Christmas swirl this year, looks like their usual cinnamon swirl/brioche, only filled with mince and with candied peel on top

available around Auckland in cafes, or try Farro for stocks
415 2018-12-04 21:37:28 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $AMD, $URI, $EFTC, $WYNN, and $MU.
416 2018-12-04 21:37:02 S&P 500 is down more, 3.24% compared to 3.1% for the Dow. NASDAQ down 3.8%, but okay.  This is what happens when you lie to inflate stocks and then have to walk back the lie a few days later.
417 2018-12-04 21:36:34 It’s fine though if you just want GB to remain a playoff team with no real shot at the super bowl because you want to keep our GM who can’t build a D to help get us there.

421 2018-12-04 21:35:56 The top five stocks that closed higher today $AZO, $NEM, $ETR, $EIX, and $CCI.
422 2018-12-04 21:35:54 $SEK.AX $NUF.AX $IAG.AX making reversal breakouts. $TTT.AX $RRL.AX making inverted H & S patterns. In a strong market, these stocks would be a no brainer. But in this market....its questionable. #technicalanalysis #charts #ASX #risk
423 2018-12-04 21:35:47 I would like to trade individual stocks but when I see all those gaps on the Dly I back off. Its pretty much the only market I dont do yet.

425 2018-12-04 21:35:36 Dont forget shorts caused by blog info word of mouth, trick money, click money stocks.
426 2018-12-04 21:35:30 Hey #TariffMan: 
Stocks are TANKING based on your reckless trade war.
The market has NO CONFIDENCE in you or your incoherent policies.
Dow down 800 points today alone.
Dow Jan 1: 24,859
Dow Dec 4: 25,027
That's a whopping YTD gain of 0.07%
$$'s better off in mattress than market.
427 2018-12-04 21:35:30 Stocks markets had a tough day as investors were spooked by a flattening yield curve which happens when short term rates move as high as long term rates.  It typically takes years when the yield curve first flattens to recession.  Investors weren't taking any chances today!
428 2018-12-04 21:35:24 Stocks got chopped today because of options. Having markets closed on a Wednesday really screws up the options markets. You'll see a nice rally on Thursday. #FAANG, $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $NVDA, $QQQ, $GOOG, $FB, $BABA
429 2018-12-04 21:35:22 Is it just me or does the stock market always drop the day after u just bought more stocks?
430 2018-12-04 21:35:20 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $F, and $T.
431 2018-12-04 21:35:17 let them work for the yanked dollar
432 2018-12-04 21:35:14 Twitter Stocks will rise in the coming days and now is the best time to buy
433 2018-12-04 21:35:10 With the wild swings I think the market is trying to find a bottom more than setting up for a big fall. Good stocks are still better than bonds.
434 2018-12-04 21:34:57 Lol this dude gonna hold stocks until the recession is staring him in the face. Markets are forward looking. If you wait until it shows up on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, you'll be selling at the bottom.
435 2018-12-04 21:34:49 I need to learn how to play with stocks. Really good investment but high risks
436 2018-12-04 21:34:44 If that train wreck was elected president the stocks would drop like a watermelon thrown from the roof of a 100 story tower
437 2018-12-04 21:34:27 I’m sharing it with the multi trillion ares that are gonna be paying me and giving me theyre stocks so we could regrow all the marijuana
438 2018-12-04 21:34:24 With banks looking bearish and no long setup one can just be in cash and chill. Mkt going much lower. Need gold stocks to set up this week or 2. Besides that take 
439 2018-12-04 21:34:22 You should look at percentage drops, since Dow is near all-time high. But, yes, Trump is the stock market’s worst nightmare. He has also attacked great American companies like Harley Davidson, Ford, Apple, Amazon, n Carrier. Trump often crashes American stocks. #DowJones
440 2018-12-04 21:34:21 Meanwhile, Trump and Trump Businesses know the tweets he'll send about economic policy, about car companies, mergers, etc. and isn't stopped and creates bookends for his business to short stocks for profit.  Again, how's he in it for you, his voters?

442 2018-12-04 21:34:02 Jon, GB has used at least three out of their first four picks on defense for the last 4 years, and have missed on almost all except Clark & maybe Alexander. Teams who invest that heavily on defense tend to get better unless you’re Ted Thompson & can’t evaluate talent.
443 2018-12-04 21:33:45 Not to undermine people... were the guys that work at Stocks & Stocks and MacSteel Int, at Elandsfontein awake listening to Johann? Phela catching the 05:50am/06:15am train means you gotta be awake by 04:30am... 
444 2018-12-04 21:33:44 There is for sure something happening behind the scene and soon the markets will get bullish. We`re going through the same cycle as stocks market. XRP is extremely undervalued, if you consider the use cases and the objectives of Ripple. We need to be patient and time will tell.
445 2018-12-04 21:33:43 None of the Dow 30 stocks wound up finishing the day in green. $MCD $VZ $PG $JNJ $KO were all flattish. And only 31 stocks in the S&P 500 were higher. Oof.
446 2018-12-04 21:33:24 Hey @bux will the new stocks app also offer options trading? Thanks guys!
447 2018-12-04 21:33:21 Most people have to do something. Trading stocks is like an addictive game... must. Press. BUY!
448 2018-12-04 21:33:19 Just looking at the charts/parabolic rises of so many leading stocks it’s no surprise the market has fallen. A recession isn’t imminent for sure, even with an inverted yield curve around the corner and trade/debt issues. But it sure feels like all the short term catalysts are .
449 2018-12-04 21:33:02 Stocks a little slow on the uptake, evidently.
450 2018-12-04 21:32:56 If you had advance knowledge of what Tariff Man would tweet about trade, you might be able to make some $$$ short selling certain stocks. Just saying.
451 2018-12-04 21:32:07 Lefties are gonna have to pick one:

B) I want strict gun control that will have to be enforced against well armed gun nuts  by an even better armed and equipped police.

Barney Fife can't disarm people with bump stocks.
452 2018-12-04 21:31:45 And hoping the tax breaks might help. But we also have investment in stocks and sometimes it’s good but it’s been more rocky. Crazy thing is husband voted trump. I did not. So I can have a discussion. Just most the time the magas I run into think he’s god.
453 2018-12-04 21:31:45 $spy days like today always remind me how easy it is to make money trading etfs and futures vs. stocks. Must say.

455 2018-12-04 21:31:40 Hypothetical question: Is there really anything that stops the President from shorting a bunch of different company stocks then tweeting some nonsense about China and trade to drive the market down in an afternoon? Is tweeting BS insider trading?

459 2018-12-04 21:30:44  Oh i got money on some stocks. We’ll see what it does in the next 10 years  but fr tho. I ain’t banking on the shit
460 2018-12-04 21:30:25 We can look at historical data points to measure how the averages would have performed. Before the Tax Cuts, Stocks performed a lot better even as Trump was president for about 11 months, after the Tax Cut, using the same measure, it performed poorly. #GoFigure

463 2018-12-04 21:29:29 Not every asset class drops regularly 80-90% in a year. Third time in 10 years, I call that regular. Shouldn't treat crypto as stocks, nor as a RE portfolio. Cryptos are highly volatile and SAFTs aside mostly liquid, and hedgable via regulated assets. That's what futures are for.

466 2018-12-04 21:28:41 So to follow the pattern of the last couple of months, I presume stocks will rally tomorrow because the US is closed
467 2018-12-04 21:28:31 "Stocks Slide, Yields on Treasurys Fall as Trade Jitters Return" Really? Is it worry about trade or the fact that the CARRY trade c/o the @federalreserve is ended?? @jimcramer

647 2018-12-04 21:00:31 Just invested into stocks and bonds.
648 2018-12-04 21:00:29 HEY REPUGNANTS!
THE STOCKS ARE FALLING, LIKE THE AN IMMIGRANT MOTHER'S TEARS! 
ENJOY!
649 2018-12-04 21:00:12 Good news for young retirement savers!  Stocks are on sale today!   Now you will get more shares for each dollar invested.
650 2018-12-04 21:00:10 Getting mad at your stocks is foolish. Does no good. Have a sound, proven plan and stick with it. If you don't have a plan, get one.  A viable one.  (And turn off the noise.) #stocks
651 2018-12-04 20:59:55 FACT: US stocks *never* had a red day when the market is closed for presidential funerals

656 2018-12-04 20:58:41 I may be in Seattle for a little but you’ll never catch me in ‘stocks and socks.
657 2018-12-04 20:58:32 I called the low values for bank stocks early.I was RIGHT.
658 2018-12-04 20:57:56 Markets are selling stocks and buying treasuries as usual. It's not strange.
659 2018-12-04 20:57:52 What do they seem to be doing to you? All I know is usually when the stocks go down, the bonds go up.
660 2018-12-04 20:57:51 Stocks diving for a big finish—wheeee!!!

662 2018-12-04 20:57:11 Unbelievable the idiocy of “great deal” wknd & today “Tariff Guy”, he never put any $$ in stocks unlike “genuine” billionaires so guess didnt realize impact after mos of Powell criticism & “passing thrash” to fed for Dow
663 2018-12-04 20:57:02 My inner evil cynic is asking if this was a set-up and did the Trump Organization buy up stocks prior to the rosy tweet from Trump that caused the market to go temporarily ga-ga, just prior to diving off the cliff.
664 2018-12-04 20:56:49 Don't blame Trump because you own the most overvalued stocks in the face of a slowing global economy. The data regarding slowing global growth has been obvious for the last 6 months, the market is only just now starting to pay attention. You should too.
665 2018-12-04 20:56:42 My cost is 7.9 brought last Friday....Do you think it is better to sell it and move to other stocks?
666 2018-12-04 20:56:11 Dawg the net since the beginning of November for alot of these stocks are soo horrible jesus
667 2018-12-04 20:55:56 What did douchebag #Trump do now to get the #Stocks to drop? Who will @realDonaldTrump blame this time? #Obama, #Hillary, #Mueller, the #NFL #PLAYERS, #SpongeBob? #ImpeachTrump
668 2018-12-04 20:55:37 It's not surprising. Some are selling stocks and buying bonds naturally.

670 2018-12-04 20:55:18 Market was likely expecting something more than Soybean exports. 

Another month of bad Chinese data can pound stocks to new lows.

672 2018-12-04 20:55:12 Stocks fall on algos before closed mkt day and misunderstanding of Trump tweet! Algos screw investors in favor of Traders! Stay put people! This too, shall pass.
673 2018-12-04 20:54:51 10yr-2yr spread is almost near 0. Previous times it first went 0 in a bull mkt...

675 2018-12-04 20:54:00 Stock market swings around .. nothing to do with anything.. if Pakistanis can manipulate the Dollar rate then they can easily tamper with the stocks.
Last 35 years Nawaz & Zardari have done nothing but legitimised Dishonesty Deceit and  Daka.. plus Treason also very trendy!!
676 2018-12-04 20:53:47 Since we found out we would have a split government for at least 2 years. The stocks have been in unstable markets, people are afraid the growing economy is coming to a stop.
677 2018-12-04 20:53:43 Now how can stocks be down?  In a year this movie has flopped with sales of $5.9 million.  Either you printed 100 copies or your entire basement is filled with DVD’s of this tripe.
678 2018-12-04 20:53:29 Got any put options to help ride this out?

It may be wise to do some dd on your portfolio and identify which stocks should be trimmed or sold completely INCASE selloff continues and long b4 further pressure on the shrinking equity portion produces forced sales

682 2018-12-04 20:52:52 When I began in this business-early 90's, it was said: "You can't own stocks in a non-managed portfolio".  Today: "What!! Are you nuts? Your managing your equities!"  #marketmentalitypendulumgoestoextremes

686 2018-12-04 20:51:39 No fun at all: US stocks fall 3% on renewed trade fears.

689 2018-12-04 20:51:02 The system is entropic and is only sustainable by the injection and consumption of new financial energy.

In a closed system it would eventually succumb to heat death as all stocks reach permanent, static values.
690 2018-12-04 20:50:56 What happened? #stocks

695 2018-12-04 20:49:52 Market close to its lows on the day....#Dow -770.  Inverted yield curves, pessimism on a trade deal, #iPhone demand weakness....all adds up to a toxic brew for stocks.
696 2018-12-04 20:49:50 Maybe they just looked at their stocks this morning and are just too depressed
697 2018-12-04 20:49:35 Question - did the Trump family perhaps sell some stocks yesterday on knowledge that it was gonna likely crash today?
698 2018-12-04 20:49:21 I own shares in two Marijuana stocks, could not have said that during the "war on drugs"
699 2018-12-04 20:49:02 Is ot worth learning to trade stocks in the long run? Is it difficult? Should we stick to crypto (or forex)?

702 2018-12-04 20:47:56 With the Dow Jones Down 800 points I guess we can safely say investors saw through the phony in the White House & his BS trade truce w/China. Stocks R down >3% across the board mainly cause dt's an ass who should not even B allowed 2 breathe fresh air in America let alone B Pres!
703 2018-12-04 20:46:46 Bof, il dépouillait quand même monsieur et madame tout le monde pour faire du pump & dump sur des penny stocks. Mais là clairement c'est pas la même échelle
704 2018-12-04 20:46:45 The stocks app on the iPhone man is so useful
705 2018-12-04 20:46:34 It didn't happen two years ago. I don't think you know how the stock market works.

It's been climbing for two years. It's up 30% from when Trump took office. This has been a very good time to own stocks.

Watch the markets the rest of the week, to early to say anything.
706 2018-12-04 20:46:23 Not comparable stocks. One has $50B in net income. The other? U check
707 2018-12-04 20:46:16 So, who owns all those tech stocks that every single one of @cnbc guests "got our clients out of months ago"?  @KeithMcCullough
708 2018-12-04 20:45:41 Uncle! 
Stocks are down roughly 3% with concerns about U.S. housing weakening, corporate credit and bond market volatility.
709 2018-12-04 20:45:40 That fucker Trump and his cronies are making tons of money manipulating the stock markets with his stupid ass tweets! They short stocks and then he sends out the trade tweet, market drops 700 points!

722 2018-12-04 20:42:33 I´m not afraid of the market going down a bit more. News come and go. Stochastics travel from high to low levels and vice versa.  A  few cyclical effects sometimes can be used for rebalancing (e.g. goldmines vs defensive consumer stocks vs HighTech vs oil). Nothing new on WallStr
723 2018-12-04 20:42:06 “60% of your assets should be put into things that can help it grow fast/big like stocks
30% should be in safer investments like bonds
10% should be accessible” 

sheeeeesh that’s hard

725 2018-12-04 20:41:57 Regardless of if it was someone they liked or not or were affiliated with, the stock market's closed when things like this happen and trailers affect stocks, they're not dropping it. But people just need to relax and the extra day won't be too bad, hopefully no couch burning
726 2018-12-04 20:41:32 Don’t know if he dumped his stocks but he manipulates the stock market all the time. His tweets have cost me thousands personally so yeah the #SEC should at least hit him up similarly as they did @elonmusk for his tweet.
727 2018-12-04 20:41:06 nope, i just want you to listen to your customers and ignore the bias. @ForbesCrypto, @YahooFinance, @Apple stocks & @LiveCoinWatch 
did the right thing. so can you.
728 2018-12-04 20:40:45 This displays how dangerous and destructive this President is.  He not only lies all the time but lies about conversations and agreements he's made with major foreign powers.  You just cost millions of Americans a ton of money, while you sold your stocks before the big drop
729 2018-12-04 20:39:59 I kinda wanna start trading stocks to keep the axe sharpened 

Currency is my bag but I wanna be the fucking best.
730 2018-12-04 20:39:52 Stocks plunge on fears of slowing economic growth: CRASH 'n BURN, BABY, CRASH 'n BURN ! Y'ALL DONE STOLE MORE THAN Y'ALL CAN CARRY ALREADY !! MAY  OUR LORD GOD PERMANENTLY DISPOSE OF EVERYONE OF YA MANGY "KOCH"-SUKKAS !!
731 2018-12-04 20:39:39 Markets closed tomorrow. Bet you're happy about that! #stocks
732 2018-12-04 20:39:25 In your experience how long can the markets behave like this? Can u find trending stocks in a non trending market?
733 2018-12-04 20:39:21 Stock market and reality are two different things.  The market is being led by those who want to destroy the President even if the people and country are tremendously damaged.  We see through this #stocks #MAGA
734 2018-12-04 20:39:20 Stocks plunge: NASDAQ DOWN 3.7 PERCENT. S&P down 3 percent. Dow off 700 points.

736 2018-12-04 20:38:03 does the pokemon center ship their stocks from japan because at first I thought it was from New York but there's no reason for it to go to kentucky if that was the case
737 2018-12-04 20:37:42 Pot stocks in the toilet.. mainstream ones at least
738 2018-12-04 20:37:37 Dk if this is true,  but it is true that his buddy and advisor Icahn definitely did dump $30mm in steel dependent stocks just before Trump announced this bs earlier this year.   
#InsiderTrading for sure.
739 2018-12-04 20:37:30 "Stocks dive and yields on Treasurys fall as trade jitters return.
The Dow tumbled more than 600 points as investors scrutinized the merits of a trade truce struck between the U.S. and China. Treasury yields fell as investors also worried about the pace of U.S. growth"

742 2018-12-04 20:37:24 I’m willing to pay a few cents more for a grocery item so that people can live with wages that keep a roof over their head and their children fed. Not everyone can be the manager and I’m tired of my taxes going toward companies that buy back stocks instead of paying their workers
743 2018-12-04 20:37:20 To all on the left who said that the economy wouldn't survive the tarrifs with China, look at the stocks. @realDonaldTrump is making America prosperous again.

746 2018-12-04 20:36:46 3/ I would have loved to some some in-depth reporting on these topics this year, which I think have an audience beyond Arctic nerds like me: the negotiation of the Arctic fisheries agreement (Asian states’ 1st Arctic Agreement, Russian reluctance overcome, unknown fish stocks)
747 2018-12-04 20:36:37 A rational person who believes in the Efficient Markets Hypothesis?  That there are a lot of external developments rapidly changing the long term outlook for stocks (interest rates, wars, new technologies, weather, etc).
748 2018-12-04 20:36:32 1) Trump and the risk of Tariffs with China. 

2) Toll Brothers a house builder said less housing is being built.
Housing starts are a leading indicator and look 6 months into the future

3) Stocks hate uncertainty. If not sure people sell.

4) Herd Mentality....

753 2018-12-04 20:33:39 If this continues to happen at this pace... people will start losing their principal on investment because... the loses compound and individual stocks never find their footing again.  Yea the majors could be up again but stocks are still not at those 52 week highs.
754 2018-12-04 20:33:29 Your lies are catching up to you FAST!! Stocks down 800 today based on the truth that you lied about the trade “agreement”
755 2018-12-04 20:33:19 Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday in the biggest decline since the October rout as investors worried about a bond-market phenomenon signaling a possible economic slowdown. Lingering worries around U.S.-China trade also sent jitters down Wall Street.
756 2018-12-04 20:33:09 Love too make money on the stocks' exchange
757 2018-12-04 20:32:40 The top 10% wealthiest Americans own 84% of all stocks, so when it takes a dive... I don't care at all.
758 2018-12-04 20:32:36 As you say, believe what  you want.  Assume what you will.  Trump is a con man and a liar.  His helpers do try to steer things a positive direction but $$ always win in his game.  Keep watching your economic indicators.  Great day today in stocks huh?
759 2018-12-04 20:32:30 WE need to explain to you that as President manipulating the stock markets for personal and others illegal gains will be prosecuted fully.  You are manipulating through false claims you make like China talks that were not what you claimed.  You also try to hurt/help some stocks!
760 2018-12-04 20:32:06 We already know it. All you have to do is confirm it. Having one human confirm it to power hungry politicians one at a time and/or in small privileged groups so y'all can sell/buy stocks for personal gain seems really shitty to normal people.
761 2018-12-04 20:31:43 That show was Wall Street Warriors... Notice the look on the lady's face when he explains why he can't scale his strategy because he only trades penny stocks. Priceless.

In the end it doesn t really matter. We all have these stocks, directly or indirectly in our ETFs, 401k etc., since their market cap is so huge. But stockpicking is always possible of course.

786 2018-12-04 20:20:55 There are many Democrats that own guns sensible restrictions are not an attempt to subvert the constitution or any of your rights. Sensible people with sensible ideas lead to sensible legislation that most agree to. Even trump wants to ban bumper stocks.
787 2018-12-04 20:20:53 One sometimes wonders why we don't bring back the stocks.

790 2018-12-04 20:20:31 I remember when I used to struggle to wake up for a 7:45 start. That’s child’s play compared to a 4am start. Don’t do stocks kids, it ruins your sleep for good
791 2018-12-04 20:20:28 Stocks go up and down,  he is a permabull, over the looong term.  He also has $100B+ in cash so... I think he would welcome a bear market.  He has more dry powder than anyone.
792 2018-12-04 20:20:22 I thought this was about illegal migration. He must own stocks.
793 2018-12-04 20:20:17 Aaaand Trump caused US stocks to drop with his stupid tweeting.

806 2018-12-04 20:16:38 Buy low sell high. Not marry to any stocks.
807 2018-12-04 20:15:51 Well that's called market manipulation. Both when it went up and when it crashed. If you think that's a mania then the same can be said about Amazon, Yahoo and other "dot com" stocks that went through 90+% drops a few years ago, and look at them now.
808 2018-12-04 20:15:37 Porn is the greatest power of all, look at what Bowsette did for Nintendo's stocks, and banning porn did to Verison's

827 2018-12-04 20:08:20 Ha no chance on that one for me (actually I don’t touch weed stocks as I have said many times don’t like the sector)! Also I don’t believe any announcements that happen Mercury retro as they will likely change in some way

839 2018-12-04 20:06:09 The stock market excuse still doesn't make sense to me, they released Lion King's trailer on Thanksgiving while the stocks were closed, and the Captain Marvel trailer was released after the stocks closed. Nah I think it's because they were going to debut it on @GMA

846 2018-12-04 20:05:03 Industrial and bank stocks led broad selling as bond yield inversion  signaled growing concerns about the overall health of the American  economy, and uncertainty regarding the U.S.-China trade truce weighed on  equities.

848 2018-12-04 20:04:20 If JP Morgan is saying "It's better to be in cash rather than stocks" and #Trump's econ advisors complain that the media should write about the present and not the future...well, y'know some bad economic shit is coming down the road. #Kudlow
849 2018-12-04 20:04:18 Newsflash from the NYTimes to the clueless tariff man: "Stocks fell on Tuesday, after President Trump sowed confusion over the status of a truce in the trade war between the United States and China."
850 2018-12-04 20:03:58 @ManaByte explained it fairly well, the NYSE is shut down tomorrow, so they won't do anything that can affect Disney's stocks (i.e drop the trailer)

852 2018-12-04 20:03:35 How I understand it. Me... Just want to make it known.
News about a product/service. McD’s offering all day breakfast probably shot stock up for a bit then it balanced out. But Starbucks CEO steps down. Stocks may have dropped a bit then leveled out.
Situations like that. Get it?

864 2018-12-04 19:59:53 If you want to successfully trade stocks you need to know everything about the company, it's dependencies, and it's competitors. There are still things that affect share price which are beyond your control but that knowledge will almost never steer you wrong.

Sudden changes can do anything. Stuff like An executive being fired, new product being introduced, weather (impacts product or service), etc.

911 2018-12-04 19:45:11 1. Laws may be broken by some but will be followed by others.
If it's illegal for a shop to sell bump stocks, a customer will have to do much more research, go much further, and pay much more for one.
Any of these could deter a person from pursuing that sale.

922 2018-12-04 19:40:45 Because millions of these hateful bigots are living on welfare and don't invest in stocks.
923 2018-12-04 19:40:39 he has talked to me about either getting into sports gambling or stocks 
he wants big money from his risk and that’s better for gambling than stocks no?

927 2018-12-04 19:39:14 Some stocks hiting the round trip from trump election rally 

Including Goldman Sacs in 15 or so pts.  Probably nothing
928 2018-12-04 19:39:09 Lol I def will . I think I’ll start with stocks that have dividends
929 2018-12-04 19:39:01 I’m not on Bitmex. I trade cryptos on MetaTrader4 with JAFX and also trade Forex, indices, stocks, futures, etc. on LMFX. So what does that equal in $? I’d appreciate it if you let me know. I know XBT is the same as BTC but I know you didn’t withdraw 1.5 M BTC. That’s over $5B.
930 2018-12-04 19:38:13 Ooooh, yeah, that makes sense. Still, I'm kinda bummed that you can't set it to 3v3 or 5v5 with multiple stocks for each player, but I guess it makes sense if you think of the players as stocks
931 2018-12-04 19:38:09 Start doing stocks?
932 2018-12-04 19:38:09 Sorry,  I can't keep track of anything!   It's such a mess. Even my dividend paying recession proof stocks that I had held are getting a haircut.
933 2018-12-04 19:37:48 The carnage in US retail stocks is especially striking given 1) lower oil prices frees up more money for consumer to spend 2) truce of tariffs lowers cost of imported consumer goods 3) employment and income gains are solid, 4) it is not very interest sensitive
934 2018-12-04 19:37:43 Leading stocks in previous days such as $OMCL, $ETSY and $CDW are still holding nicely above their buy points.......today looks like an overbought sell-off
935 2018-12-04 19:36:52 Because they repealed regulations and allowed companies to sell garbage stocks and fuck peoples accounts over that were held up by faith alone, the banks were bailed out and held no accountability afterwards they need to be regulated

You. “How can I short stocks? Millions will die?”
Charioteer: Arjuno, you must honor god by doing that which you are best at”
940 2018-12-04 19:35:24 1) People would buy shares in the hopes of the value going up and making money
2)People bought the shares with credit and if the value dropped they wouldn't be able to pay it back
3)Experts predicted the market would crash and sold their stocks causing people to panik sell
941 2018-12-04 19:34:57 Even the half of Americans who don't own any stocks know 'dropping x-number of points' is a bad thing for stockholders. Also, we don't take pleasure in being evil to less fortunate people because 'profit'. But enough about us...
942 2018-12-04 19:34:49 There are still plenty of wypipo with high time preferences and it is a mistake to think all tribes with white skin are genetically identical. Hence the different outcomes of various societies developed from those stocks.
943 2018-12-04 19:34:31 This crooked Tariff man pulled a hell of a stunt ystdy by making false announcement of Chinese agreeing to drop US auto tariffs, causing DOW to surge 400 points Monday, when he dumped his stocks before Chinese denying such agreement making DOW drop 800 today.
SEC must investigate
944 2018-12-04 19:34:28 Can't you have a reasonable explanation for the overall trend of the market (not clear what time frame) and have no good clue about individual stocks or even sectors? (Serious question)

956 2018-12-04 19:31:21 Irelevant. The market making these kinds of drops the way they have the last three months can lead to investor fears that can create a recession. Already 2018 has been a flat year for stocks. It's off 1700 points since June of this year. That's 6.3%.
957 2018-12-04 19:30:42 Did u chase the gap up yesterday? Hopefully you had stops in place. #Stocks #market

959 2018-12-04 19:29:49 President Trump, 
PLease do something immediately about the stock market. Stocks have gone down a record 700 points today. Fix this! Investors are very nervous.
960 2018-12-04 19:29:41 posit) trump dubs himself Tariff Man
consequence) stocks panic, drop 600-800 points
result) economy looks shaky
conclusion) trump needs to stop nicknaming himself
bonus) trump should go to jail before he causes more damage
961 2018-12-04 19:29:29 While in Muhuru I saw birds that have migrated from the lakeshore on our side because of dwindling fish stocks and imvasive hyacinth. It was beautiful seeing the birds again. Only mbuta is now found on our side but it cant beat the taste of fresh tilapia.

964 2018-12-04 19:28:53 Do I care. Russian, Chinese, Latin American and Indian stocks make a perfect foil to Don the Ponz. He couldn’t keep cutting US taxes to allow buybacks by his buddies forever could he? You really don’t understand, shortermism, markets or geopolitics do you?
965 2018-12-04 19:28:02 My coworker: stocks are down 800 points. Wonder what’s going on?

972 2018-12-04 19:26:02 Jacob Wohl, soon: “Trump is trying to make stocks cheaper so Americans can buy buy buy at low prices!”
973 2018-12-04 19:26:01 This hurts.  I need better rallies to readjust.  Stocks always act as 1 asset class.  If we’re down 400 might be good at this rate
974 2018-12-04 19:25:56 Really? The Dow is down by 649 and has been down all day. People are moving stocks to bonds- this is what happened before the last recession! Yea, I think we all want to see visuals of Paris chanting "We want Trump." Liar.
975 2018-12-04 19:25:33 I don’t know how stocks work, but it does all seem too high. But I have felt that way for the last 5,000 points!

Telling y’all. Bears become Bulls. Go cash and wait. Buy that shit when everyone is selling.
984 2018-12-04 19:21:23 We’re not even on it. Tariffs or not our stocks representing the dow index needed a healthy pullback before continue running. Investing 101 implies that if anything keeps running up without pullbacks it’ll drop harder.

987 2018-12-04 19:20:27 .@ChrisJansing @SRuhle HELLLLOOOOOOO! The stocks are tanking because @realDonaldTrump LIES and the dutiful media still believes him. He has always been a grifting conman. Instead of chasing his tweets or believing him then fact checking, assume EVERYTHING he or says is a LIE.

991 2018-12-04 19:19:08 Just looked. It's at 640 and whipsawing all over the place. Fraid to look at my stocks. Supposed to be stable ones. Nothing stable today.

994 2018-12-04 19:17:08 #CNBC - way too funny listening to a bunch of financial journalists and one economist trying to explain the decline in stocks today and what to do.
995 2018-12-04 19:17:05 The twat dumped the country in the shit then did a runner to his country estate. In a just world he would have been touring the country in stocks so people could throw rotten eggs at him. Pig fucking moon faced arse.
996 2018-12-04 19:16:50 I was wondering what the hell happened to my stocks today.  Pinhead!!! You owe me money Trump!!
997 2018-12-04 19:16:30 ".. also thinks that the US government should ban investors from trading US stocks.."
"this whole idea of the government owning all the businesses and assets has already been tried before.
"It was called the Soviet Union.

"Lenin would be so proud."
Don't read history - relive it
998 2018-12-04 19:16:20 LOL! Why are some people buying stocks in a market like this?
999 2018-12-04 19:16:10 News flash: bump stocks
1000 2018-12-04 19:15:55 "no one should ever lose. It’s like the economic equivalent of a participation trophy… no one should go home empty handed.

"Economist Roger E.A. Farmer .. thinks the Fed should step in and start buying stocks to prop up the stock market.
1001 2018-12-04 19:15:52 Short selling seldom classified as a core “investment” strategy... experienced short sellers may shy away from labeling short selling as an investment strategy per se. Some famed hedge fund managers may hold “strategic” short positions in certain stocks or sector in 3...2...1
1002 2018-12-04 19:15:11 So you think stocks are bought and sold because of Twitter? All those dumb hedge fund managers following @POTUS twitter for stock advice!
1003 2018-12-04 19:15:04 Damn it I should have taken some profits yesterday. I knew captain flip-flop Trump would ruin it. Anyway, learn to #HODL #stocktraders like #bitcoin #crypto  folks, because #stocks aren't winning either.

1009 2018-12-04 19:13:44 Good... They have to buy some bonds b/c The Fed is not buying the US bonds that they were over the last 10 years..... It is possible for stocks & bonds to exhibit an uptrend at the same time
1010 2018-12-04 19:13:36 I have to wonder, did the oil plunge even help retail?  I know retail stocks have rallied but they always seem to rally between Labor Day and Black Friday.  I mean I know higher gas = less money for everything else, maybe I’m just questioning if we got a boost recently anyways
1011 2018-12-04 19:13:31 Stocks plunge nearly 3%, Dow sheds more than 700 points today..was trump confused or just lying about Monday's meeting with the Chinese on the trade talks. It seems that trump's support staff was doing around trump's tweets to make sense of it.The financial market reacts negative
1012 2018-12-04 19:13:29 I feel like every month trump claims there’s a deal and stocks surge and then they collapse again when everyone realizes he’s full of shit. At what point are they gonna just stop taking him at his word
1013 2018-12-04 19:13:14 Hey genius while I'm over here collecting my nice cool 3% your stocks are plunging today because of your orange God in the White House. Good job keep up the great work
1014 2018-12-04 19:13:10 Humbled. I say so because I know what it means to lack. For a child born and raised at the shores of lake Edward in Uganda, its disturbing to see fish stocks reduce in catch at the lake. So any program to diversify the sect are all welcome.

In this environment, you should have upside plays keyed for strong stocks, and downside plays keyed up for weak ones.

Now Tariff Man says he loves tariffs, deal or no deal.

Steel and aluminum tariffs not lifted on Canada and Mexico, even though we have a deal.

Maybe auto tariffs soon.

Dow plunges more than 500 points on confusion over status of U.S.-China trade deal
Global stocks gave up the gains they notched a day before on investor optimism that the United States and China would reach an accord on a trade deal.
1031 2018-12-04 19:09:02 And when Americans are poorer the stocks go down like today
1032 2018-12-04 19:08:48 An ugly board as freight/logistics stocks take a beating along with the rest of the market. Biggest losers: Hub Group -10.3%, Daseke -11.4%, Knight-Swift -10%, YRC -9.9%, Schneider National -9.4%, Covenant -9% XPO Logistics -7.9%. Dow Transports -4.35%

1040 2018-12-04 19:06:27 That dow is dropping fast, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that trump is about to take a very public hit.. I'm sure no Russian money buying massive amounts of stocks to prop up trumps presidency is being pulled from the markets to make his fall harder

1043 2018-12-04 19:05:59 The grand majority of my trading decisions are made based on the pressure or lack of pressure I feel in my account and how my watch list of stocks are behaving.. Today, I'm not feeling nearly as much pressure as the indexes would suggest. .. very little.

1047 2018-12-04 19:05:21 That's crazy how I was talking about wanting to invest in some stocks and today the stock market takes a plunge smh
1048 2018-12-04 19:05:16 Good for stocks.
1049 2018-12-04 19:04:45 Seems pretty tight brah. Prices are going down. Gas is $1.87 here and it was over $2 just a few weeks ago. Besides, markets are really getting more volatile since major companies are consolidating themselves more. Why do you think everyone is doing buybacks on their stocks?
1050 2018-12-04 19:03:26 Amazing the RNC hacked, stocks sell off, d5 panic?
1051 2018-12-04 19:02:39 If today we had a bad close on heavy volume and if stocks started to fail their pivot points and bases.
1052 2018-12-04 19:02:32 This just in: stocks tumble on realization that the President of the United States is so full of shit that if you gave him an enema you could bury what remains in an Altoids tin.
1053 2018-12-04 19:02:27 If you are in mutual funds and shit you dont have to mover money you are diversified. If you own stocks and you have gains sell. But you should have sold 2 months ago when I said this. Don't wait longer, some stocks wont come back because they where shit to begin with
1054 2018-12-04 19:02:23 Trump has done 3 things right since Russia got him elected: Pulled out of TPP, banned bump stocks and declared tomorrow a National Holiday. (See? Credit due)

1065 2018-12-04 19:00:00 how are your stocks doing?????
1066 2018-12-04 19:00:00 Markets on Monday cheered the temporary trade-war cease-fire following Trump’s dinner with Xi in Buenos Aires. But stocks gave up a chunk of those gains on Tuesday as the details of any agreement remained unclear - Bloomberg
1067 2018-12-04 18:59:51 MSM Monday: stocks are rallying because of the deal with China                   
MSM Tuesday : stock are tanking because of the deal with China
1068 2018-12-04 18:59:44 I wonder whom Trump thinks he is kidding? And what was the point of exaggerating Xi meeting outcome? Is he giving his friends shorting window on stocks? He can not remain as President or we will have a DEEP recession.
1069 2018-12-04 18:59:36 U.S. stocks plunged, as a litany of concerns wiped out the rally in risk assets!
1070 2018-12-04 18:59:30 STOCK MARKET UPDATE: Lions I want you to focus on what is happening right now and it is big. Stocks are dropping and there are FEW buyers. Sound familiar? This is how the 29' crash started. Take note...@realDonaldTrump @GregMannarino

1074 2018-12-04 18:58:03 @Stephanie_Link You have to stop going on @HalftimeReport as it is clear the show does not look at fundamental valuations in stocks, rather purpose is just to create fear, without any concrete basis, so Wall Street firms such as $MS can pick up assets cheaper.
1075 2018-12-04 18:57:17 It'll be a great time to own the automotive parts stocks.  People will be forced to repair their significantly underwater car because they still need transportation.  Autozone, Advance Auto, O'Rillys, and Genuine Parts.   $ORLY is best of breed

1077 2018-12-04 18:56:56 Nah man, their stocks are so low and their game sold so poorly we will see a repeat of Battlefront 2. I do not expect this game to produce the updates it was promised. Do not be surprised. #GoWokeGoBroke
1078 2018-12-04 18:56:42 my stocks and bonds are doing terribly today!
1079 2018-12-04 18:56:27 You lie!

Billions predicted it. Some, I'm sure, were very fine people who had he ability to short large amounts of stocks and securities so they got richer no matter what.
1080 2018-12-04 18:56:15 People buying bank stocks and small caps should understand the risk.
1081 2018-12-04 18:55:45 When I look at the profiles of most of these young guys on Twitter, I notice virtually none of them weren't even alive when I made my first million trading stocks. Lots of inexperienced traders. God bless you... I hope you can have as long of a career as a trader as I have.

1084 2018-12-04 18:55:30 Yes but he’s saying building wealth off of the buisness or being wealthy but not being able to using that money that was earned to extend it. Opening shares,stocks, and businesses is “building wealth.” Can’t request a business loan without buisness experience

1086 2018-12-04 18:54:54 lol I picked a great time to buy some stocks
1087 2018-12-04 18:54:48 Working to just pay bills and never have enough set aside for a trip, or to invest/save your money. That’s not normal or right. It’s not how life used to be. Meanwhile, executives wages keep increasing, companies making record profits aren’t raising wages. They buy back stocks
1088 2018-12-04 18:54:47 Stocks were up and now they're down lmao
1089 2018-12-04 18:54:46 ) Cent vingt-deux jours après avoir quitté les Fréoles et Nouchka en amont de Port-Choon, nous entrâmes, en guenilles mais debout, tous stocks des flotteurs consommés, dans une cité sans âge qui devait être Chawondasee.

1091 2018-12-04 18:54:31 Personally I think he’s done his time in prison and should now be strung up in public for a while and then left in stocks for a time before being drowned by the incoming tide at Traitors’ Gate! 
1092 2018-12-04 18:53:59 Some midstream companies have extremely boring businesses like $WMB. But the stocks act like they are Chinese steel companies
1093 2018-12-04 18:53:43 you don't fucking buy utility stocks at 2% divy if you're feeling mighty bullish
1094 2018-12-04 18:53:34 Stocks getting hammered today
1095 2018-12-04 18:53:32 The big weight on the $SPY here is likely Mueller's court filing on Michael Flynn's involvement in the Russia investigation, which is planned to be submitted by midnight. FYI. Short term pain could produce good opps in great #stocks. Is your watch list ready?
1096 2018-12-04 18:53:31 Wall Street seems to be done with any initial enthusiasm over the US-China talks. As it becomes clear the agreement was light on details and not an end to the trade war, stocks are tumbling. Dow is now down 700+ points.
1097 2018-12-04 18:53:20 Fed should be buying stocks to save our 401ks!!!
1098 2018-12-04 18:53:00 Canadian Pot Stocks.
1099 2018-12-04 18:52:56 #stocks Major market top appears to be in place.  Looks to us like defacto peak was in January; nominal new highs reached recently are, we thnk, false breakouts.  If this is correct, then top formation has been ongoing for 11 months. Not good!
1100 2018-12-04 18:52:32 Went all cash sold all my stocks yest and today. Before the sell off. Killed it this year. Haven't had a losing trade since 2016 I believe.

Couldn't care less if you don't believe me BTW :).
1101 2018-12-04 18:52:25 ok so the way it works is that on national days of mourning the nyse shuts down which means if Disney released the trailer tomorrow, they would lose an opportunity on A LOT of their stocks rising. it’s a financial move that is necessary, they’d be missing out on millions possibly
1102 2018-12-04 18:52:20 I agree that Media exacerbates everything (part of the reason why the housing finance stocks are at the bottom though they hv governance and sound earnings). But the things mentioned in the article shows that the top management enriched themselves at the expense of the company
1103 2018-12-04 18:51:47 I'm hoping SEC (@SEC_News) keeps an eye on what Trump Co and Kushner Co sold right after the president announced all is rosy, and the stocks went up, and whether they're buying the same stocks now, that everything is down.
1104 2018-12-04 18:51:35 Shorts a lots of stocks today. Working well.
1105 2018-12-04 18:51:28 I think alpha men are too emotional to be in charge of something as important as trading stocks anymore.
1106 2018-12-04 18:50:58 Stocks may be taking the elevator down but everything is fine if the cable can hold up...

1108 2018-12-04 18:49:21 most stocks are down 10-20 % TODAY/// that is a #Crash
1109 2018-12-04 18:49:21 Whenever the market is down big, I look at the individual stocks for a "read" to see if there's widespread pivot failures, or worse, base failures. Right now, I'm not seeing much damage.
1110 2018-12-04 18:49:16 Stocks taking a pounding today!
1111 2018-12-04 18:49:12 Has @simonjbridges not noticed that the populist right is in trouble throughout the English speaking world?

1112 2018-12-04 18:48:48 Fari do you think the smart money is leaving stocks for bonds?
1113 2018-12-04 18:48:38 Who is buying stocks now?

1117 2018-12-04 18:48:25 And stocks are plummeting once again thanks to Trumps 'Brilliant' economic policies.

Tariff man has done it again.

Stock markets down. US consumers paying for all those tariffs...
1118 2018-12-04 18:48:02 i can't keep up with the stock market lately. since late September, the volatility has been absurd. various stocks up 5% one day, and down 5%+ the next day.

1135 2018-12-04 18:44:55 CNBC is laughing as Dow collapses 750 pts. as bank stocks, trade, China supposedly depress our ' slowing economy.'  What is slowing??

1166 2018-12-04 18:37:20 Whoa! Stocks down a lot more going into my lunch. HALF HEDGES STILL ON, TREND STILL DOWN FOR NOW. Well on our way to shaking out a lot of investors. For the rest of us, enjoy the ride!
1167 2018-12-04 18:37:18 I won’t go long without good reason. High float stocks have to put out more than acquisitions to entice me. When I go long, it’s usually for a very limited time. Small caps to me are not investments. They are short term trades.
1168 2018-12-04 18:37:17 Is it possible to get the money back from you, what I invest yesterday in stocks because of your „real deal“ with China???
Hmmm, Elon Musk had to took responsibility for disinforming. What about Mr. Trump???

1178 2018-12-04 18:35:14 Euro banks are leaders, US banks have major problems. Buybacks drying up and it isn't even a blackout period. Nobody buying stocks, smart money is long gone, retail only fools left
1179 2018-12-04 18:35:02 From a business standpoint, day traders ruin the stock market. Consistent buying out and selling of stocks not only drops the value of that stock for the company, but drops the overall gain and value of that stock in the market place which affects daily market growth.

1240 2018-12-04 18:22:01 Looks like #bonds#stocks##stock market Looks very much like the flight to safety has begun.  Partial yield curve inversion is historically reliable leading indicator of forthcoming recession. Think big bear has arrived, or else is very close.

1264 2018-12-04 18:14:44 agree completely, I guess I read your post wrong. I thought you meant today they are trying to support stocks via artificial manipulated lower rates where I see the rates are crashing on their own based on growth outlooks being very poor

1307 2018-12-04 18:04:36 Well in rare good news for me: I moved my 401k from 100% stocks to 80% cash yesterday afternoon. Wish I’d done the same with my personal portfolio. Still 100% invested, gunshy to cash out after getting burned with my sell then chase in October.

1315 2018-12-04 18:02:36 Stocks tank when they lose confidence that "that China Tariff Thing" was real.  If it's a hoax, it was a really expensive one.   China's been around way longer than us.  But Tangerine Tito might not know that.

1412 2018-12-04 17:38:36 $spx #stocks I think we’ll close above 20dma of 2727. Yield curve is fine — main points are positively sloped: Bills-2y-5y-10y-30y. Ignore illiquid securities. No recession coming - we haven’t even gotten capex wave from tax cut yet given tariff BS. This market has YEARS to run.
1413 2018-12-04 17:38:33 It's not just random jitteryness. Stocks fell because the yield curve on Treasury bonds inverted today, a move that typically signals a coming market contraction.

1433 2018-12-04 17:33:45 Stock market in early October: "10-year yield rising too fast! Must sell stocks!"

Stock market today: "10-year yield has fallen too fast! Must sell stocks!"

*Rinse and repeat until crazy.*
1434 2018-12-04 17:33:44 Stocks popped  then dropped 

I love it.

1438 2018-12-04 17:32:48 Media views fluctuate like the prices of stocks. When confidence is low, media bring it lower. When confidence is high, media takes it to the roof.

1479 2018-12-04 17:25:14 I don't have a lot of short positions.  I actually have very small positions in a handful of stocks. About 15% of my trading account.  I am short $AMZN today. Was  neutral on it via BeCS and BuPS (Iron Condor). But I've flipped. Now short the stock and long puts...and happily so.

1485 2018-12-04 17:24:16 I noted the crazy divergence between bonds and stocks in terms of "truce" reaction yesterday. Stocks tried to ignore it for a while. Not working out so well now.
1486 2018-12-04 17:24:10 The Friday+Monday rally only pushed SP500 to fulfill the objective of retesting the previous support and several stocks filling gaps.  With core China economic news remaining bad, trade deal is less important.  Stocks will go down.

I invest in stocks & bonds and make a fortune. People who "invest" in bitcoin are like people who "invest" in Powerball tickets.
1495 2018-12-04 17:20:17 U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as investors reassessed the significance of an agreement reached by the U.S. and China to postpone new tariffs and as the market digested a flattening yield curve in U.S. government debt.

1496 2018-12-04 17:20:13 L'IFI est pour moi aussi une aberration, mais il a déjà une logique plus cohérente : taxer les stocks improductifs et libérer les flux qui peuvent créer de la croissance.

1563 2018-12-04 16:58:11 I need to start investing in stocks
1564 2018-12-04 16:58:01 it's amazing how the stocks fluctuate.  one day you rich, one day you broke af
1565 2018-12-04 16:57:55 Fidelity prevented my getting $766 NIKE check 330 days in 2017. Complained & they said my account was closed!

Under law they cannot shut off account & remove stocks yet I can’t  add money to it & thus have inactive account! That’s what I get for being client since 2006? SCAM!
1566 2018-12-04 16:57:50 We are referring to publicly traded companies as the notion was re stocks and their viability to sustain.

If you believe 200 publicly traded MJ companies can survive on their own in Canada in one year then you are an idiot.
1567 2018-12-04 16:57:48 Yet when Yellen's FED gave all the banks the green light to buy back stocks, no peep from Dimon....and the stock has more than doubled since....smells putrid imo.
1568 2018-12-04 16:57:36 In 2000 it was y 2 k boom and it stocks were over the roof and constitute most of the indices which gave the distorted picture,2000 top was not broad based,that's why in we parlance it is considered as wave b and not major impulsive top
1569 2018-12-04 16:57:00 I fear the Yellen suggestion and SNB practice of directly buying equities thus further decimating what was once a "market of stocks".....
1570 2018-12-04 16:56:48 $meip data is nice. Entry was at $1.50.  Long ball game.  For all stocks have done absolutely nothing for awhile.
1571 2018-12-04 16:56:39 You also think $FB and $AAPL are garbage stocks
1572 2018-12-04 16:56:33 $study what I want to see is a bunch of narrow range days and/or back filling and bouncing in the leading stocks. gaps in base like $irbt $splnk super bullish if narrow range day 2.  $tsla perfect back fill and bounce today.

1576 2018-12-04 16:54:53 Dry Bulk Carrier Stocks Win Big On China Tariff Delay
1577 2018-12-04 16:54:31 Stocks are retreating this morning over new skepticism on China/US Trade and upcoming Negative Yield Curve.  MBS is up 9bps, pushing up against double ceiling of Fibonacci and 100 DMA.  Yields have dropped to 2.94% and is falling below it's 200 DMA.
1578 2018-12-04 16:53:04 I *highly* doubt anyone has ever actually used them for the purposes they say they have, or would. They do not work right. You have to finesse it, and even then they can fail if they are manufactured and centimeter this or that way. 

This has never been about bump stocks.
1579 2018-12-04 16:52:30 I can't even look at my stocks anymore, I can understand why some people throw themselves off buildings now....
1580 2018-12-04 16:52:22 Reveling and swimming in the lucrative profits of their corporate stocks?
1581 2018-12-04 16:51:41 Yep! 
& the big joke is, bump stocks are a pain in the (you know what)  any that friends and I have tested dont work properly. Nothing close to an actual full auto. The newest ones I tested worked for 2 -3 shots then just sucked. And u have to fire loose hold as heck! 
1582 2018-12-04 16:51:32 Ridiculous. To preserve their control and their billions in pharmaceutical stocks, they’ll stoop to any level.
1583 2018-12-04 16:50:43 Fuck you @northernassist sending a 2 carriage train to Preston from Manchester at rush hour. You’re a bunch of feckless cunts who should be put in stocks and pelted like the vermin you are. Eat shit and die.
1584 2018-12-04 16:50:17 These active stocks are from short sellers?
1585 2018-12-04 16:50:15 Bastards! Bring back the stocks!
1586 2018-12-04 16:49:49 EA is also a good buy now, and if I were you, I would also buy some Take Two shares. There are some pretty strong evidence that either a new bioshock or borderlands will be showed off at the game awards, which would surely send the stocks flying
1587 2018-12-04 16:49:42 A big lie on America is booming. The stocks of the RICH are booming, but mainstream workers are still struggling.
1588 2018-12-04 16:49:38 If promoters are into creating artificial panic and they have time to do this then forget at seeing at 2000. Because if it is at 2000 then other pharma stocks would have given higher multiple returns sir
1589 2018-12-04 16:49:07 The recent drama for $APHA shows just how much of a speculative sector #PotStocks are. Good or bad news sends a stock to the sky or the gutter.  Although, recently, good news (other than $CRON) hasn't been doing much to help pot stocks. That's why technical analysis is important.
1590 2018-12-04 16:49:06 Players are just like stocks. They are commodities not what makes the franchise.

1598 2018-12-04 16:43:44 I think that stocks should make a return.  A gossips tongue was nailed to a post in the market square during the middle ages.  What should happen to a pseudo president who can't keep it in his pants?
1599 2018-12-04 16:43:28 That was a false I mpression he left for voters. But the truth is he sold GM stocks & foreign service properties to balance budgets at a loss. He & Mulroney both added the vast majority of debt we currently have. And though cutting many pgms, still managed consecutive deficits.

1610 2018-12-04 16:36:56 definitely some negative sentiment/price action in the #cannabis stocks of late and fuel was added to the fire with the short report on $APHA but don't lose sight of the positive backdrop that has emerged in the U.S. politically/economically/medically; still in the 3rd inning

1632 2018-12-04 16:28:44 With the extreme money printing since 2008, the gap has become much worse. The cheap money has flooded into property, stocks and shares, and the asset price inflation has created the huge wealth gap. Most people without assets have suffered austerity, debt, wage deflation.
1633 2018-12-04 16:28:17 Everyday exercise: buy stocks w/ great fundies and enormous mutliples that could easily compress 20-30% in a heartbeat or buy very beaten up stocks w/ further (reasonable) earnings risk and are dirt cheap (w/ est assumptions)- seems to account for 2/3 of what I look at...

1656 2018-12-04 16:20:04 So let me get this straight. 

The 2-10-year curve flattening isn't a signal as it falls all the way to zero, but then the second it falls below it becomes important?

Then you need to get the recession's timing and it's affect on stocks right too?

Have fun with that...
1657 2018-12-04 16:18:23 The main implication of an inverted yield curve for investors is that bonds are likely to outperform stocks for the next several years.  Instead of arguing about whether there will be a recession, sensible people will be busy reallocating towards high quality fixed income.
1658 2018-12-04 16:18:04 We must have plans. Plans to buy. Plans to sell into strength. Plans to limit losses. Each is crucial. And you need all 3 laid out BEFORE you buy.  #stocks

1755 2018-12-04 15:43:46 Anyone citing that S&P 500 *non-GAAP* corporate profit for the year (up better than +20% YTD) is a noisy and even unreliable data series should consider that the much cleaner / much broader NIPA (BEA) data shows corporate profits up YTD by about the same amount. #earnings #stocks

1836 2018-12-04 15:19:10 Many people think that stocks over $100 can be tough to trade. The smaller the position size actually minimizes your risk. The larger Average True Range could actually mean bigger profits with proper risk management

1932 2018-12-04 14:44:37 One problem for palladium is a relative lack of investment options. There's physical bullion. But that has a huge premium and it's not as liquid as gold. And there are ETFs. But again, liquidity might be a concern. And what, a handful of stocks, most of which aren't pure plays.

2001 2018-12-04 14:21:21 Yea that's good. The reason why I think shorting is difficult is because by the time you get clear signals the market is ready to turn back on you. Rather wait for stocks to go down and wait for long opportunities.

2074 2018-12-04 13:51:48 Remember in OCT, when the "big call" was that "its different this time because stocks and Treasury Bonds are going down at the same time"?
2075 2018-12-04 13:51:18 That's been discounted. That's why the market dropped more than 10% & most cyclical stocks much more than that. Correction is over & lows are in. As you know I am predicting a 1% long bond for later in 2019. A bust is coming but first a market melt-up. Avoid linear thinking.

2088 2018-12-04 13:47:55 Nikkei raised 1000 yen in one week. However, today wasn’t. Japanese stocks have been controlled by great deal of foreign investors. Maybe they wanted to get gains before crushing. Their selling caused today’s crush, I think.

2162 2018-12-04 13:00:03 I picked 8 stocks to invest into and hold in December 2017. 4 came out in profit, 2 broke even and 2 came into a loss. One of the profit stocks however doubled in  value over the year meaning the profits well outweighed the losses of the other 2. Yet, I'm still not ready yet IMO.
2163 2018-12-04 12:59:41 Watch OSU because if they keep Day, they're going to be even better. Buy Purdue and Michigan, next season both will at least hold their value. Sell Iowa and NW, talent leaving will mean a downturn in their stocks.

2283 2018-12-04 11:21:00 I needed to buy a couple of stocks yesterday to replace a bond that was called. Saw market was up because investors actually believed Trump accomplished something with Xi. Going to wait till people realize it's a con and market settles back down. Maybe as early as today.

2314 2018-12-04 10:55:38 Both the stocks are fundamentally sound, however valuations remain expensive. Hence, Buy on dips would be appropriate
2315 2018-12-04 10:53:52 Thinking about this and you wonder why the IC tips the same junk month after month.  I have come to the conclusion it is because their senior writers like junk.  Simon T mostly tips junk.  The number of Simon T's stocks that have gone bust is probably in the 100's now.
2316 2018-12-04 10:53:22 @umarashraf_28 Why you prefer trading with stock instead of currency pairs? Or you just started first with stocks and didn't try with currencies?
2317 2018-12-04 10:51:47 Totally agree with it. If anything learn coding or stocks.

2327 2018-12-04 10:43:45 Brokerages and analysts are responsible for people to run away or sell the stocks because of their downward revisions just because of market corrections. Every brokerage should give fair value, bull/bear market targets, so that people can act based on the situation.

7. Pay taxes
...you get the picture, people ain't really doing nothing to stop the bankers- me included. All that talk is irrelevant.
2360 2018-12-04 10:15:36 Traders like stocks with a lot of liquidity (heavy volume). That keeps bid/ask spread tight and makes it easier for them to open and close positions
2361 2018-12-04 10:15:14 I often use the Darvas box to buy stocks.  This year there were more head fakes than breakouts. The market makers do not let me make money easy this year.
2362 2018-12-04 10:15:00 I certainly do. Companies bought back stock and did not create new jobs. In fact, they are laying people off. Their stockholders were happy but those people who don't own stocks got shafted. Maybe you have no idea how tax cuts work.

2415 2018-12-04 09:31:32 Subbarao on vulnerability "Vulnerability is if something goes wrong, suddenly a lot goes wrong, very quickly. That is what happened to our system." That is what also happens to stocks that are vulnerable. When they have lost price strength & when bad news follows they break

2474 2018-12-04 08:41:47 I would not get over excited about it; as with all stocks/ITs it is just supply and demand. Any real judgement on performance could only really be valid after around 3 years IMO (which is true for any portfolio in my view).
2475 2018-12-04 08:41:23 Thank J, but I think $URA doesn't explain this de-correlation in #uranium stocks since in some companies $URA sales have been small and months ago. My theory is that spot/ term price has not reached the minimum viable to produce $40-$60. At that point the rise will be brutal.

Not everybody is cut to be a successful trader. If you are consistently losing than it’s best to accept it & move on with your core job/business

2482 2018-12-04 08:32:35 Well, of course, just far too early for any meaningful appreciation (or decline) in value of the basket of stocks but the point that encourages me is that as I suspected it would, the IT trades at a premium.

2486 2018-12-04 08:31:51 replacement. A player being at a struggling team doesn't negate their talent, Robertson and Maguire (Hull) are prime examples. Boly at Wolves also looks to have great potential too, IMO he'd improve our current CB stocks, esp because he's a left sided CB and he'd be cheaper

2. Manafort sentencing memo Fri, Dec 7.

Why is this important for stocks? In my honest opinion, we'll probably see some market-moving attention diversion tactics.
2568 2018-12-04 07:01:08 @KevinYoder We had problems with tariffs that screwed farmers. We had problems with trade wars which hurt our businesses. We did not like tax cuts that big corps used to buy back stocks for their executives. We watched our VA system get worse. It was about lack of priorities.
2569 2018-12-04 06:56:47 It's already here. It began when we accommodated immigrants. It began when we suspended six yr old for using stocks for guns. Suspended others for scribbling. When we quit saying merry Xmas, etc etc add it up n we aren't America anymore

2574 2018-12-04 06:47:26 There's a lot of misconceptions here that it's only "bad companies" (Activision, EA) with stock drops. Unfortunately, it's part of a bigger problem - since October, most tech-related stocks have dropped around 35%, which was already declining since July.

2577 2018-12-04 06:42:58 Some clarification, almost every stock in gaming went down at least 35% since October. Take 2, Activision, and almost all tech stocks in general plummeted. There was fear (and still is) of another recession.
2578 2018-12-04 06:42:52 They are using more. Look around at the Red Flag laws popping up. And Trump is considering banning bump stocks. OK fine no loss. But for the government to suddenly deem your property illegal and forcibly take your property without out reasonable compensation is Theft.

2645 2018-12-04 05:39:19 $SPY Exactly So what about their opinions. Traders calling for stocks/markets to go down all the while my stocks have been going up, for over a week. Expected a pullback this morning. Stocks go up and down. It's what they do. A lot of yip yap everyday. Execution is what matters.

2648 2018-12-04 05:33:23 I think what they said is that the big pharma stocks they own are still good investments.  Give me a break.
2649 2018-12-04 05:32:30 PSX is still very overpriced given the recent interest rate hikes. It should go further down. Let's keep some cash till the stocks are available at the right prices.

2656 2018-12-04 05:29:25 anyone tracking $swi looks like another IPO that could run.  I remember $tpic from 2 years ago had big ipo run so these alt energy stocks sometimes have some power.
2657 2018-12-04 05:29:01 Yep, Put I run my own business.
Repatriation was a one time benefit. Raised large sums of tax dollars. Yes, my my 401k doubled since trump won. And markets never continue to rise. My value is double now. Guess you are in wrong stocks. 9/18 month increase 1.1% couple w lower tax.

2676 2018-12-04 05:16:05 buying govt loans (or maybe even distressed loans) from banks who need dollar funding because they also have dollar deposits. obv china has a lot of dollar denominated loans. so now banks get dollar liquidty. but PBOC is making them buy stocks to get that dollar liquidty
2677 2018-12-04 05:15:53 Tough to find value in PM stocks, esp on TSX/TSXV.  Why buy an explorer or developer when you can buy $RMS.ax or $SLR.ax so cheap?

2688 2018-12-04 05:09:06 Apparently people are leaving the place en mass because they are removing all nsfw content and thats what the majority of the websites users come for and stocks are dropping like crazy. At this rate I doubt tumblr will even be a thing in the near future lol

PHARMA SECTOR OF THE DAYS
2690 2018-12-04 05:06:48 If a stock is going to down in price and also announce bad results; it’s in a pretty bad position, downward trend. it doesn’t mean that is going to capitulate.

The negative effect is clear, but capitulate/ death spiral? I don‘t see it and that’s why I brought up the stocks.
2691 2018-12-04 05:06:17 its mostly bc Everyone is abandoning since stocks have already went down by like 3% since they announced it
2692 2018-12-04 05:04:49 anyone knows lithium battery manufacturers or related companies in india, which are listed? planning to buy related stocks for long term!
2693 2018-12-04 05:04:26 U.S Stock market settling down after tough October and November. Trump giving China 90 days to resolve trade issues will help in short term. But if negotiations don't resolve trade issues when 90 days are over, watch out below for stocks!
2694 2018-12-04 05:02:14 Stocks ki lagi padi he.
2695 2018-12-04 05:01:48 I was long sino too and got out! And another shoe company really saved myself. But got burned on $crx
2696 2018-12-04 05:01:16 They’ll have to print. Buy financial assets, including stocks, provide guaranteed income, etc.
2697 2018-12-04 05:00:24 Disagree ,   Everyone now knows where Turnbull”s  Real Party of choice was , Labor !  The Libs stocks go up every time the creep tries to advise or undermine !
2698 2018-12-04 04:59:38 They got huge pressure on Dec 3rd when JP Morgan downrated Verizon and Verizon stocks went down 4.3%. Shortly after, tumbler announced the change probably to get back into the ios app store.
Their announcement is a joke. "Responsibility" and "impact" when it is all about $. 
2699 2018-12-04 04:57:51 Stocks in the news: Sun Pharma, Ceinsys Tech, VST Tillers, NCC, Uflex, Ramky Infra, Infibeam Avenues, Omax Autos and Gravity (India) are stocks which are in the news today.

2700 2018-12-04 04:57:30 I know, it's one after another after another. Their stocks plummeted the day they started this new no nsfw ruling. I can't imagine they are every going to completely recover with all of us gone.
2701 2018-12-04 04:57:08 I have experience of doing this early on the expiry and had the painful experience of sitting the whole expiry in loss to finallly get the credit of the trade when the stock moved in my favour learnt a lot there no ratio spreads early on and never on stocks with IV over 100&near
2702 2018-12-04 04:56:46 I only hated it because 4 was a 2 stock game with rage. If Ultimate is 3 or even 4 stocks then sure, let's kill early.
2703 2018-12-04 04:56:36 Advantage of being active on social media is one can identify the "hot stocks" and "hot sectors"......And stay away from it. A lesson to remember, 'There are no free lunches!!'
2704 2018-12-04 04:56:33 A Major indicator that recession  is coming next year big time! The recent fall of the housing and auto stocks are the canary in the coal mine as they are huge parts of the economy.  Here comes quantitative easing 2.0 leading to big inflation time to buy gold &gold mining stocks.
2705 2018-12-04 04:55:44 I hope that the approach to Smash Ultimate balance this time does not consist of: let's literally take all kill options out of the game so that stocks last for 10000000 years zzzzzzz
2706 2018-12-04 04:55:15 OKAY LETS sekali out of stocks.

2709 2018-12-04 04:53:23 May be another reason why the dollar and stocks are selling off in after hours, while bonds, gold, and oil are big.
2710 2018-12-04 04:53:19 RT TheBullBull "There is silent buying going on in a group of stocks that are connected to lithium batteries. 

You will get the news only after these stocks have appreciated 100%."
2711 2018-12-04 04:53:11 They make their money through funding on being allowed on app stores and getting taken off apples had their stocks plummet so that’s why they’ve agreed to take it off so receive it mostly back.
2712 2018-12-04 04:53:07 I'm 60% allocated into bonds. I'm getting a solid 3%, and if we get a year end rally, I'm gunnar dial it up to 80%.

2766 2018-12-04 04:09:07 Look at it like this: They ban bump stocks because they can make a semiautomatic fire close to the same rate of fire as a full automatic. Ok, then they come back with you don’t need a special bump stock to bump fire any semiautomatic (that has recoil). Now gotta get the guns.

2770 2018-12-04 04:06:14 Yes. Watching the YouTube video right now. Crazy. Stocks broken. Others are better to own imo.
2771 2018-12-04 04:04:53 This is what happens when you’re turning an illegal industry into a legal one. Most of these pot stocks are run by CEOs that are about as trustworthy as an ICO advisor. There are a lot of scams rife in this industry. So don’t trust everything you hear. Research it and confirm it.

2775 2018-12-04 04:02:51 Like showing list of poor stock picks and saying stocks a scam. 7% commission over a 7 year hold equal to same 1%/yr many charge for managed money AUM fee. New structures (Tshares/daily NAV) = lower internal fees than trad. Ashs. Some compelling programs exist for right client.
2776 2018-12-04 04:01:55 And the Democrats friends in the fossil fuel industry? Uranium One, BP, Exon and many more contributed to the Obamas and Clinton’s. How about George Soros? Looked at his energy stocks and investments lately. You can’t fool us all.
2777 2018-12-04 04:00:49 I said in a previous tweet and agree with you, stocks probably make "new highs" if the curve flattens and inverts just like 2006-2007 and 2000. The fed is walking a very tight rope....

2798 2018-12-04 03:46:02 People take this cease-fire for 90 days (too long?) as a good sign for stocks, but at what cost? Commodity has to go down to generate extra cash to be invested in stocks... US/EU Mkts. seem to have different perceptions than EM Mkt...
2799 2018-12-04 03:46:02 Not expensive if you consider how much you can make.Nucleus is more catalyst driven trades on small caps, and millionaire roadmap is more technical swing trades in small caps, the stocks are different as these 2 mentors trade differently, so no overlapping imo.

2809 2018-12-04 03:39:48 Mixed feelings about the markets today. Stocks are up on China resolution hopes, but the treasury yield curve inverted (a bad signal that typically predicts recessions). 

In oil, prices are up and look poised to keep rising on supply cuts (good for Alaska, bad for L48 economy).
2810 2018-12-04 03:39:30 Market is supreme. Not the analysts, smart or ace investors but the 'market downturn' that reveals the hollowness of some of the stocks that flourish under the veil of great businesses in the market upturn.

2823 2018-12-04 03:29:00 Sorry, the facts don’t support you.  GM got tax cuts, they used the money to buy back stocks, now they’re closing down plants and jobs. Only the executives are making out like bandits. And California is doing great.
2824 2018-12-04 03:28:55 I like some analysts because they only call stocks a buy when it’s ready on the charts.  Not some $GS $MS $BAC analysts who only call a buy after the chart is at overbought level just to dump to some unsuspecting retail traders.  Only #Barron can give you the best

2882 2018-12-04 02:44:33 Eh, I'd dispute it. In 2014 there were a lot of mini bubbles going on. Crypto had its first bubble pop, there was a mini bubble in cannabis stocks, and a mini bubble in penny stocks (remember $PLUG? LOL) Much the same as today, ppl were pointing to them as signs of froth.

2884 2018-12-04 02:44:16 @netflix I highly suggest you capitalize in advertising for upcoming movies to subsidize better deals for yourself so you can license them on your service for the future. 1 ad per episode or movie isn't going to be bad at all. Your stocks may go up too!

2889 2018-12-04 02:39:18 I like to short weak stocks and trade the downtrend instead of playing weak bounces. Playing bounces and catching falling knives is a technique that makes me feel uncomfortable
2890 2018-12-04 02:38:58 Yes. We still have stocks. :)
2891 2018-12-04 02:38:38 its funny that they all say the same thing.... "market of stocks" "ones that are working" "driving each other" ... its like they all have a bs word phrase book that the share with each other
2892 2018-12-04 02:38:34 Those are the colors used in South Korea and I assume a few other Asian countries to denote up and down markets and stocks. (Red is good luck in much of Asia) Lived there for years and it never ceased to confuse the F out of me.
2893 2018-12-04 02:36:57 Hi Manas - Good to hear abt you nailing GSS. But out of curiosity, Was GSS part of your portfolio? If not how did u pick the stock? I mean, with numerous stocks around, what is your recommendation on picking specific stocks out from nifty's numerous stocks? Regards
2894 2018-12-04 02:34:41 Hmm $vz already slumped 3.5% on a day where most us stocks were up dramatically. They bought yahoo for 4.5bn, yahoo paid 1.1bn for tumblr verizon lost 10bn from their market cap yesterday, so I guess its priced in pretty well. :/ shame, would love an excuse to short Verizon!
2895 2018-12-04 02:33:32 Stocks still priced too high for 2019 stock and macro data. That hasn’t changed

2904 2018-12-04 02:26:42 S&P still remains range-bound despite this 6% rally off of November's lows.

2920 2018-12-04 02:18:23 One way to slow down the building of financial walls by the 1% is a basic income. And pay for it with a tax on stocks/royalties/rentier income that created the 1% in the first place.

2931 2018-12-04 02:13:34 U.S. Market Check

    Stocks rallied after the U.S. and China declared a truce in their trade war, while the dollar weakened and oil gained.

    The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.98 percent.
2932 2018-12-04 02:13:19 Asian stocks slipped Tuesday, signaling fading investor applause for the U.S.-China trade truce.

Stocks in Japan, Korea and Australia posted modest losses while Hong Kong futures pointed lower.

2958 2018-12-04 01:58:23 You’re not very good at misinformation.

Not exactly a surprise that he kept the same message during the primary and then the general election.

3001 2018-12-04 01:22:49 I am so in love w/the fact that my Reno supermarket stocks & will deliver Mint it’s it’s to me. My California friend is jealous of the minty goodness bc they don’t sell them out there.
3002 2018-12-04 01:22:23 Thier stocks is gonna tank then they realized how bad they screwed up.
3003 2018-12-04 01:21:38 I traded stocks on the tweet because I knew it was a lie.  If @realDonaldTrump says something related to the markets there is a better than 80% chance it is a lie and the initial market reaction will reverse.  Easy money!
3004 2018-12-04 01:21:29 I think all of them are similar: owner makes a call, and when he buys lots of other buyers buy. I wish when I bought stocks the price always move in my favor (regardless big ir small). A single trader can move price, many traders following is a clear advantage fir the owner.
3005 2018-12-04 01:20:42 You need to research the gold propaganda or maybe not.Only a proportion of gold stocks were sold. The gold was sold for yen I think and then into Euro I think as far as I remember. A profit was made at the time but obviously the gold price rose since that time,hence the gold myth
3006 2018-12-04 01:20:12 That's good considering there's 3 stocks now

3008 2018-12-04 01:19:30 Holy cow! Down 28%! I sure hope they didn’t pay someone to do research on stocks that are going down and then forgot to short them!
3009 2018-12-04 01:17:26 Growth slowdown fears in China, oil price collapse and corporate earnings recession were perfect storm for stocks to correct. Crypto market too small at the time to really have an influence.

3012 2018-12-04 01:16:04 The reason why is Trump's economic policies are effective for the moment. People's 401K plans and stocks are finally seeing gains and jobs are being created.  Not great paying jobs, mind you. I think in the future the problem will be the National Debt and a middle class tax cut.

3014 2018-12-04 01:15:21 oh and just to add on, between the apps you can see the styles are different because I have less options with PicsArt so I have to either add more stocks/textures/glow or use a filter.

3016 2018-12-04 01:15:00 I didn't sell the stock at a loss. The market crashed and its value plummeted.

My only point I was making is that stocks are risky and saying that money in an HSA would take care of your medical expenses is far beyond the reach of many middle class and poor people.
3017 2018-12-04 01:14:05 I don’t care about projections right now. I’ve seen guys who were projected this and that have there stocks raised thru combine etc. There is not much more he can do to improve his stock playing against VIRGINIA... come on man get real.

3028 2018-12-04 01:02:44 The theme is we’re—finally—seriously talking about correcting China’s atrocious behavior.

That’s good.

US stocks up around 50% since the 2016 election.  China’s down about the same.  That’s 1) not a coincidence and 2) not Obama’s legacy.

It’s equity investors believing Trump.

3044 2018-12-04 00:54:37 Yeah. I was just trying to correct the error in the image. Stocks didn't drop cause of ban but because of JP Morgan downgrading Verizon. Which I think is the REAL problem. They are talking big about responsibility and impact when it really is only about shares and money.

A 1/4 century down the road we’ll see a law that swings the pendulum back (I.E. bump stocks legal for some). Also need to make sure to secure 2020.

3070 2018-12-04 00:40:46 European markets rose on Monday as mining, auto, technology and oil stocks surged after US and Chinese leaders halted additional tariffs and agreed to fresh talks.

3075 2018-12-04 00:38:34 US stocks rose on Monday, with the S&P 500 having its best start to December in eight years after the US and China called a temporary truce to their trade conflict, triggering relief buying of perceived riskier assets such as equities
3076 2018-12-04 00:37:38 That is the moment JP Morgan downgraded #Verizon which sent stocks 4.3% down. Verizon owns #tumblr and shortly after they announce the ban to get back into the ios app store.
It is just about money.
3077 2018-12-04 00:33:07 So #Verizon owns #tumblr.
#JPMorgan downgrades Verizon and send #Verizon stocks tumbling down 4.3% on Dec 3rd.

Then tumblr announces to ban porn on the same day?
Coincidence? You decide.

3092 2018-12-04 00:22:20 Suggesting we invest @RayDalio style?

Allocations:
Stocks 30% (gain on average 9.2%/yr)
LT Treasuries 40%
Intermediate Treasuries 15%
Gold 7.5%
Commodities 7.5%

This allocation lost < 4% in '08. Not an expert but I don't think bonds/Treasuries are as safe as they were in 2008.
3093 2018-12-04 00:20:55 The Simpsons have predicted so many things & it’s always true but people don’t pay attention till after it happens lol.

3094 2018-12-04 00:20:41 What stocks? All stocks?
