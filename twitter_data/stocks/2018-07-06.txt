43 2018-07-07 23:13:29 OK @JdfMike and @Pearskw here is some feedback.. the fishing is being restricted to protect our fish stocks from extinction. How will you feel when you look back and realize your actions helped kill off our salmon?
44 2018-07-07 23:12:36 Whatever $ you invested in your tits, I'm sure the return on investment is better than many stocks. Kudos!

53 2018-07-07 22:58:08 Just finished getting our house painted. Took up most of my evenings this week, moving stuff around.  Nice little break from cannabis stocks... but time to look for the next buy the dip opportunity.
54 2018-07-07 22:57:34 So without kbuu, the only two ways to get true blockstring into 50/50s that you can't challenge with reflect or something with A21 is either by doing 236H with 4 stocks + gotenks or by having Sonic Warp stocked + gotenks atm. Everything else is reflectable rip
55 2018-07-07 22:56:50 It is what I think. If you don’t why invest in this stock or better yet short it. When I buy stocks I do so because I believe they have potential to go up.  I am not looking for them to go down. If you don’t think it will go up, I would like to know why?
56 2018-07-07 22:56:22 Et selon mon pote, qui pour la première année a migré dans cette seconde partie, c'est là que ça a "tapé". Assez forts pour certains (relativement à leurs stocks).

Le hall 6 était blindé d'illu et objets Pokemon pas du tout officiels. Donc les "tout petits" semblent épargnés.

63 2018-07-07 22:46:38 So NASCAR Heat 3 is just an updated version of Dirt to Daytona. Just with Late Models instead of Street Stocks. 

Cool and all...but I have no prob just playing the original. PS2 graphics don't bother me one bit.
64 2018-07-07 22:45:16 I go into blow-by-blow detail in a few yday posts re how i manage an intraday futures trade. With stocks, there is no set reward/risk ratio. Each person should gravitate to what is best for their personal makeup. Good question

68 2018-07-07 22:39:11 Its been said that with this trade war w China...Americans will buy more American products...plus it is hurting China's economy/stocks
69 2018-07-07 22:36:48 It's a conservative right problem thinking that bump stocks and AR-15's are a necessity for a civilian to own.
70 2018-07-07 22:36:11 If I were you I will retire from politics because you didn't have stocks to sell out in the market of politics. 
You are disgrace to the Honourable senators of federal Republic of Nigeria.
71 2018-07-07 22:35:42 Have you noticed that its only the white people who have complained about their high capacity magazines and bump stocks being taken away?
72 2018-07-07 22:35:27 C Politicos article Wall Street helping China understand Trump Corps bought those stocks cheap Not getting rid tariffs those stocks will take longtime 2 increase in value preventing corps from capitalizing on an increase. They can't afford 2 leave that $in limbo Loss of big $

78 2018-07-07 22:28:20 I like a Galaxy Ripple! The British shop here stocks them. I didn’t realize UK Milky Way changed, good to know!
79 2018-07-07 22:26:35 Just so you know (for when you move here). The grocery store that is LITERALLY two minutes walk out my front door, stocks Kinder eggs in every checkout lane.
80 2018-07-07 22:26:15 So far from what I've read big corps have not only benefit from tax cut but they're using that $2 buy back their stocks cheaply. Wall Street HAS 2 stop the tariff effect if they don't stocks may not rise preventing corps from capitalizing on their buyback
81 2018-07-07 22:25:59 For example a person can pay a portfolio manager to buy and sell their stocks to for potential gains without any knowledge of trading themselves and the stocks they buy are backed by strong companies, Amazon, google, Apple, Coca-Cola etc.
82 2018-07-07 22:25:10 Oh good choice! My local grocery store now stocks the HUGE bags of them, and it’s soooo tempting.

84 2018-07-07 22:24:00 Public shaming is as old as wooden stocks. He deserves it.
85 2018-07-07 22:19:18 Oh man stocks in graph paper going up
86 2018-07-07 22:16:19 He doesn't paint. He is not a painter. He literally lifts weights and talks about stocks and eats a lot of spinach pizza and hearing him say that made me wanna cry
87 2018-07-07 22:15:49 Yes -- the stocks!  More popcorn.........
88 2018-07-07 22:10:42 Tone deaf besides completely corrupt ... holding a can of soup saying a price increase is soo small, while shorting stocks left and right. Fell asleep at a meeting, drooled, and mopped it up with a thousand dollar tie. SEC is all over him, yesss.
89 2018-07-07 22:09:31 i have 4 charts: 2D 1min, 2D 5min, 15D 15min & daily. the $SPY is always on another monitor too. i mostly trade off 1min. i've traded $S & $GE in the past, no reason to think i wouldn't again. but for the immediate future, i'm building my account with the market leading stocks
90 2018-07-07 22:09:01 I lost to Mata the Wario player 2-1. Hes really good, i had an awful fast fall c stick nair sd there, and missed free kills costing me stocks but its ok.

Managed to beat Ho3k Dill 2-1, and Bow a very good Mario player 2-0 to make it out.

In losers top 48. Still in this
91 2018-07-07 22:09:00 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
92 2018-07-07 22:04:03 When stocks devalue, people with money buy more waiting for the return to mean. In no way will a stock plunge hurt the wealthy. They carry wealth in other classes than just stocks. In fact many wealthy families made their fortunes drying downturns buying low values assets.
93 2018-07-07 22:01:15 ETF’s can be a powerful tool for passive investors. Do yourself a favour and save some fees! Little research goes a long way. #investing #buyandhold #stocks #ETFs #market #business #finance
94 2018-07-07 22:01:11 We got stocks at moulsecoombe fayre on Saturday 14th. Why not come and let Lloyd get his own back :)
95 2018-07-07 21:58:59 In case this helps shortcut a longer debate:

The fact that everyone started investing in housing - instead of business or stocks - just shows how ridiculous the government burden on the economy is, that everyone jumped on the loophole with everything they had.

...
96 2018-07-07 21:58:03 Have since spent hours searching for similar houses in warmer climes online. I think it could become a lifelong internet search.
97 2018-07-07 21:57:49 My last time saying it, if you want to get In to stocks text me 5163091271
98 2018-07-07 21:56:34 We viewed a few houses when we were in France last month and one of them had pedigree cattle and vintage machinery in the barns. It was the holy grail of farm and property joy - I fear I embarrassed myself.
99 2018-07-07 21:54:07 Further, when I show ppl what I do when they ask, is I'm blending my fruit to a smoothie,almost all fruit w/ skin on other than citrus. 

The peels can be brined & candied later for a snack. Or used in stocks.

Not sure why snark (not you PD) is so heavy on attempts to be healthy
100 2018-07-07 21:54:05 He never did stocks, lots of bonds tho and CD accounts, back when they used to actually pay decent interest
101 2018-07-07 21:53:23 Anyway, I can while away many hours by typing ‘vintage agricultural’ into EBay.
102 2018-07-07 21:52:18 Stacking penny stocks while I’m flipping these birds
103 2018-07-07 21:50:34 Sold 3 properties and 3 bits of land this year. One left to sell, fingers crossed. Then never want to see an Estate agent again 
104 2018-07-07 21:49:40 We don't know what happened. But stable Acetobacter in mono association can be lost if stocks kept in a standard way, together with other stocks. Different processes might have happened in the many stocks kept for so many years in labs. @InessPais @markowenmartin

107 2018-07-07 21:46:19 Now that @EdMartin704 @704NASCARHeat have laid the groundwork and put late models in Nascar Heat 3, an all dirt game with Pure Stocks, Modifieds, Late Models etc would be awesome.
108 2018-07-07 21:37:18 I switched from being bullish to being neutral several months ago. I expect stocks to go sideways for a while. The easy money is gone. Psychology is changing.
109 2018-07-07 21:36:38 I just figure when I get blocked its because I was right and they don't want to even debate the point as they have nothing to stand on :)
110 2018-07-07 21:35:56 Stocks are safer
111 2018-07-07 21:35:52 Wish I had. Wheely bins were thrown, pint glasses smashed, and a crowbar wielded. We had to call the police, think things would have got pretty gnarly if they hadn't turned up!
112 2018-07-07 21:34:57 I believe Acuna is...its weird. I was looking for Bowman, admittedly months late and then one random night went into a local Target and they had blaster boxes, a card guy apparently stocks that department not employees and just brought them, I bought three next day, all gone
113 2018-07-07 21:32:18 Stocks up on condoms.
114 2018-07-07 21:32:14 I don’t think the store near me stocks them which is annoying but thanks anyway.
115 2018-07-07 21:31:46 Wrong. Stocks have discounted cash flows.
116 2018-07-07 21:31:29 I'm not looking at sector specific stocks. I guess I wouldn't turn down a pot stock because it's in the marijuana industry, but from I'm not actively looking into them

$EPAM $OMCL $MDSO $PRAH $ZTO $HUYA $SE $SFIX $NOW $BABA $QLYS $MEDP $BSTI
118 2018-07-07 21:30:45 Look into uranium stocks. Not the actual substance itself but companies that handle uranium. They've bottomed out
119 2018-07-07 21:30:00 US #stocks ended higher for the holiday-shortened week, as investor sentiment was lifted by a batch of encouraging economic data amid the escalation of global trade tensions.
120 2018-07-07 21:29:43 1broker you can do it, but they don't have $FIT. Their selection is pretty limited for stocks.
121 2018-07-07 21:29:04 Stocks don't mean dick, most ppl are in serious debt or living paycheck to paycheck.
122 2018-07-07 21:26:44 Stocks and skateboards. Interesting mix.
123 2018-07-07 21:24:41 Would you consider pot stocks too?
124 2018-07-07 21:23:48 Since moving farms in March i am happy to say my long term addiction to Rightmove is cured.
125 2018-07-07 21:23:47 after one week of having my youtube channel monetized I have made $3.19. should I get into stocks?
126 2018-07-07 21:23:01 No, I don't own $MDXG  and don't short stocks either. What you say makes sense philosophically but not when you're dealing with stock promoters. Then it is safe to disregard everything they say.
127 2018-07-07 21:22:30 Oh also completing the challenge in Smash Wii U where you have to complete Classic Mode on 9.0 intensity without losing any stocks.
128 2018-07-07 21:18:05 I’m sure that soil piece will pay for a pad with a pool in the south of France ......
129 2018-07-07 21:16:19 Los fundamentales no son algo pobres? Según Finviz, el EPS este año ha descendido... aunque lo cierto es que las ventas y los cortos van como cohetes 
130 2018-07-07 21:15:50 the fidget spinner stocks have just rose as a result of this photo
131 2018-07-07 21:14:59 What they mean "safety" is their bank account balance. That's the only thing they want to keep "safe." Because they have stocks in the detention centers and they profit from ICE detaining people. They don't give a flying FUCK about the "safety" of the public.
132 2018-07-07 21:13:52 ...a bigger divide in our class system. The money never trickles down. They're greedy, they reinvest in their own stocks and dividends, wages have been stagnated for decades.  The autocrats, the plutocrats and oligarchs have made a kill - they won't give it up unless the working
133 2018-07-07 21:13:26 Oh, I don't need a new house either. I just enjoy looking at what I could afford in other cities and countries. 

I should probably get myself an actual hobby....
134 2018-07-07 21:12:53 it does appear to be micro-fractional shares based on purchase amount - will look into this more - and if it only offers certain stocks then it may not be much better than the early challenges of Cardlytics - but i’m hopeful this could be a good model (I have ways to improve it)
135 2018-07-07 21:12:10 Salute all my niggas who really focused on the stocks and not focused on the ppl
136 2018-07-07 21:09:23 My life entirely. Well, except I don’t need a new house.
137 2018-07-07 21:08:42 Are you sure about that ,what if the person has a car sale doesn’t bank people buy cars he stocks cash , um not saying that’s the case but please avoid saying your normative facts as if they were facts
138 2018-07-07 21:07:39 Sorry about your commenting issues; I have them myself sometimes. For example, WordPress thinks I'm a bot 

If you're close to retirement, or currently retired, I think only 20% in stocks is a good move--especially in anticipation of an imminent correction.
139 2018-07-07 21:06:40 Sorry for lack of updates, my phone died

Quadruple 2 stocks for my first 2 sets so far. Dill got upset by a Robin player (i was projected to play Dill for winners top 48).

148 2018-07-07 20:44:04 It'll take a while, most shit stocks from the late 90's took a couple of years to get delisted and unregistered. We're also relying on a crappy private website to track total marketcap and crypto listings.

152 2018-07-07 20:39:06 Fake accounts...hacked accounts...have been wondering if Facebook and Twitter casually let those happen because they could count it as growth...and without growth stocks can become less attractive...the markets fascinate me, but i am no expert*...

157 2018-07-07 20:36:26 that’s probably a good idea...the shoppers I work at stocks them, so you might be able to find a copy at one? copies usually last a while cuz people don’t often go there to buy games

163 2018-07-07 20:26:23 Lol, because I'm waiting to learn how I can piss away more than most people make. Seriously though, what's your ratio of stocks to bonds? Is it too risky to invest in the energy sector right now? 
164 2018-07-07 20:26:05 That doesn’t mean the overall market is doing poorly. It means you didn’t pick great stocks.
165 2018-07-07 20:25:28 I just reread what you wrote. "The economy is not in a good place."
This just so wrong.

Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week that they are optimistic about U.S. stocks on expectations of double-digit earnings growth, accelerated buybacks, and pro-business policies.

168 2018-07-07 20:21:50 Thanks, Carolyn. It will be insightful to track $REGN, $CELG, $IBB and especially $BIIB in the upcoming trading sessions. When stocks trade in #SectorSympathy there is often a "breaking of the ranks" in some issues. In essence, it highlights and separates the weak from the strong

184 2018-07-07 20:05:14 Don’t mistaken a recession for investors taking profits from over valued stocks !!  That could cover up to 3,000 - 5,000 points !! I wouldn’t hold my breath too long for either one happening anytime soon !!
185 2018-07-07 20:02:16 Its all about marketing. There stocks are increased 7.27 +% just because this rumor.

187 2018-07-07 20:00:27 I don’t feel that way. People my age almost always go for real estate before stocks, if they have the money. They didn’t have any money during 08 to get burned in the first place.

The lousy prick does something sick to the poor & weak that the only fit punishment once Mueller tears him a new one is the stocks, on the Mall, for a year, so everyone he's harmed can come squeeze his flabby cheeks & slap him like Mo on Curly

194 2018-07-07 19:55:11 Tony, i would be careful about adding anything of an anecdotal nature to your analysis, e.g. "shorts hit today," or "it has high short interest so it's ripe for a big move." One does not want anything other than the lines on a chart to influence one's thinking, imo #stocks

200 2018-07-07 19:49:47 @HouseGOP Are you sack of shits so desperate to have a republican president that will ignore that the idiot trump & family continues to turn OUR country upside down & laughing stocks of the world? He lies continually, he has raped & groped women, he continues to bully women..
201 2018-07-07 19:48:46 Remember your PROMISES!! Or wasn’t it the truth?? Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Shame on you, Donald Trump!!

204 2018-07-07 19:43:18 This is from a Chinese newspaper.

Chinese technology stocks fall to lowest in 43 months ahead of deadline for US tariffs

On Friday US tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese goods are set to go into effect, raising investor fears over the global economic outlook.
205 2018-07-07 19:41:56 I can also follow each company much closer than if I held 12-15 stocks. I literally watch the green growing and if my investment thesis does not play out, i can reallocate. My next 10 best ideas are also fine, but simply not as good as the top 6.
206 2018-07-07 19:41:18 Please God that your account is taken off. You should be ashamed of your childish rants No other world leader behaves like you. Very few have Twitter accounts and none of are laughing stocks. You bring shame on the great office of President of the USA. You are not fit for office
207 2018-07-07 19:40:57 Lol you would have to get with somebody that’s into stocks and bonds. I know places like Subway, Store front Dominos pizza, even Chick-fil-A don’t cost that much to franchise.

212 2018-07-07 19:35:44 Why don’t I hear about the 17% dip in China’s stocks on the MSM?  Is it because that would prove our POTUS is actually winning for our country?  Thanks again Mr. President

218 2018-07-07 19:25:05 I believe that #AssetAllocation LOWERS your #returns significantly because instead of being invested in high-earning stocks, you are spread out among lower return vehicles and they bring down the entire portfolio. Hence, 10 is the new 4.

222 2018-07-07 19:23:00 If you can always buy back that is great.   For me, I know I struggle to buy back stocks since the pattern is usually not as clean as my initial entry.  Many stocks can re-breakout from less than ideal patterns during an uptrend.    I want to keep my decisions to a minimum
223 2018-07-07 19:18:28 Can you short stocks on Webull?
Also, I tried sending you a private message without any success.  Can you shoot me a message? I have a few more questions.
224 2018-07-07 19:14:12 I did not advise Bush officials on policy. I advised them on financial conflicts of interest, just as I am now advising Senator Tina Smith to sell her millions of dollars in medical device stocks before voting on health care.  The only person hoping she doesn’t is @KarinHousley
225 2018-07-07 19:14:09 You fool. They were in SAA stocks before this or with the UN forces in the area.
226 2018-07-07 19:14:05 Ouch. Stock market isn’t a good argument. My stocks are doing horrible.
227 2018-07-07 19:14:04 Brian QE is meant to be "reflationary" and in the US it was as investors sold risk free assets i.e. bonds to buy stocks. The charts are clear.
228 2018-07-07 19:13:46 It is very important to view mice as reagents, although they are obviously living ones that should be respected as such. But like all reagents, they can get contaminated and change over time. It is thus necessary to check their « quality », replenish stocks and do controls.
229 2018-07-07 19:13:10 Look @ the weekly charts like BA, NVDA, NFLX, AMD, AMZN. Great example of how stocks in an uptrend break all the rules. Fun fact I owned 8k shares of AMD around $3 in 2015. Held through its lows of 1.80 and started selling around $5.50 - $7.00 "because it can't go higher". It did
230 2018-07-07 19:12:23 In short, usury-based financing means faster growth and more concentration of wealth. If you lose, the bank doesn't. Asset based is like stocks. If the company lose, you lose too.

234 2018-07-07 19:10:15 It's the marketwide pull backs that are getting me out of the larger trend now.  I guess it's okay as those same stocks are on my watch list and I just rebuy them when market pressure eases
235 2018-07-07 19:09:49 ONE VERY HUGE POINT with the Stock market... As companies buy back their Stocks, 84% of Stocks are owned by 10% Americans; with 10% owned by FOREIGN INVESTORS - Leaving 6% owned by 90% of Americans - THERE IS NOTHING SUPPORT 401Ks now!  They have no reason to be "Happy"
236 2018-07-07 19:09:06 Surveille les stocks et alertes pour Lana déjà... Après au pire du pire si tu te décides et qu'elle est sold out y aura toujours des duos sympas
237 2018-07-07 19:08:42 Also there’s lots of stocks I have bearish opinions on, I don’t go out of my way to invest ANY time into exposing it to “help” people. I take my time and invest it in finding companies I want to invest in, not deter people from investing in.
238 2018-07-07 19:06:34 that's why the Trump tax cut was so stupid,  especially cutting corporate taxes , it did not bring money back into the economy ,it gave money back to the corporation so that they could buy back their stocks and like Harley Davidson move their Factory someplace cheaper.
239 2018-07-07 19:06:12 Well, could you imagine legislation banning weapons from civilians that are "civilian" semi auto but modifyable through bump stocks... Isn't there a stigma for hunters using modern ARs as being bad anyway?

245 2018-07-07 19:00:30 #Investment is never certain. And yet, mathematically, if you are in the right #stocks, even when there are down times in the long term you are still better off staying in the #market than dropping out. But psychologically people react more strongly to losses than gains.
246 2018-07-07 18:59:49 Analysts have no incentive to take an extra effort. Also most analysts have never invested in stocks, they are smart kids out of MBA college.

252 2018-07-07 18:53:44 Discovered on a value-investing binge: "Interestingly, there were 29 stocks within the S&P 500 that traded above ten times revenues at the peak of the dotcom mania (though that number did surge higher after prices had already peaked). Today, there are 28." (h/t @jessefelder)
253 2018-07-07 18:49:07 Why does @W7makeup charge crazy prices for their products on their online store, when everywhere else that stocks their products sells it for half the price?
254 2018-07-07 18:48:42 I knew I was different because when I got my first $100 at age 10 I invested it into stocks & bonds.
255 2018-07-07 18:45:51 That is why company’s buy back their stocks, and indicates the company was in a good enough financial position, with cash in hand, to be able to do the buy back.
256 2018-07-07 18:45:07 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

258 2018-07-07 18:41:59 I was not skeptical in 2013 as valuations looked extremely cheap in small, medium and select large cap stocks. Those who sounds very optimistic right now are indeed trapping you.
We have seen huge inflows thru MF's ... Nifty still near highs, MF's giving negative returns.

262 2018-07-07 18:32:49 Where I am, now hiring signs up everywhere. All jobs needed, can’t be filled. A company buying stock back isn’t market manipulation, it means the company wants to take back more control of their company. It also means the company was doing well and didn’t need stocks any longer

275 2018-07-07 18:22:11 Thank you for the update and all the advice about penny stocks!
276 2018-07-07 18:21:53 If you do figure out a way to fix this, Brandon, could you also fix the other problem I'm having: too many of the stocks hitting 52 week lows are in my portfolio.
277 2018-07-07 18:20:52 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?
278 2018-07-07 18:20:11 No stocks < $10

281 2018-07-07 18:17:32 The same Good Idea Fairy that told *all* the manufacturers that push button/turn knob shifting was a good idea.

Whomever that was, they should be put in the stocks for a week.
282 2018-07-07 18:17:12 As an oceanographer, all I can think about is, all the pollution in the oceans, all the plastic, the depleting fish stocks, the bleaching corals, CO2 mixing with H2O to make carbonic acid reducing the pH, the oil spills and all the other insults humans have brought.
283 2018-07-07 18:17:01 Ouais puis ensuite ils vont annoncer la date de sortie pour 3 mois plus tard, rupture de stocks, livraison 14 semaines et tout le délire. Mais au pire, dès qu'il sort je me choppe le 2 et je giveaway celui là :D

286 2018-07-07 18:13:47 Why would anyone want a leftover from the 94-04 federal gun ban???  So many better PCRs out there now. @sigsauerinc @czusafirearms and many others with >9 round magazines, muzzle devices, and folding or adjustable stocks instead of that POS  thumbhole design.  Garbage
287 2018-07-07 18:11:33 You mean you're mad that your human trafficking stocks coming through the border went down?  You have a strange way of truth telling.

289 2018-07-07 18:09:32 And, unfortunately, probably not one of these lives would be saved by changing laws or banning bump stocks or large-capacity clips. There are just TOO MANY GUNS out there—especially in and around Chicago.

292 2018-07-07 18:05:44 C'est surtout qu'en occasion ils doivent se faire une marge sur le prix de rachat qui ne se réfère pas aux même stocks que les jeux neufs. Du coup lors de promos on arrive à ce genre de situation "wtf".
293 2018-07-07 18:05:13 Yeah for sure one sec!
294 2018-07-07 18:04:20 I’m hearing all Craiola crayon stocks have been cleared off the shelves in England...something to do with kids emulating henderson and Kane 
295 2018-07-07 18:03:01 Lol stocks are just paper wealth, until you sell....then you get paper money.
296 2018-07-07 18:01:17 $CELZ ~ When researching penny stocks, you should carefully weigh any potential gains versus fundamental factors underlying the company i.e its debt, cash flow, & “BUYOUT POTENTIAL”. DD CELZ ASAP!

306 2018-07-07 17:45:36 Chicago is disappointed in you! As the NRA zeroed in on bump stocks, use of silencers in the state of IL, your silence was heard loud and clear. I cannot wait until November to vote you out!
307 2018-07-07 17:44:43 Left stocks to go to crypto, now going back to stocks. Should've just done both
308 2018-07-07 17:44:40 No, my stocks are fluctuating so rapidly I’m not sure where they end up.  Taxes, time will tell. I’m terrified for my journalist friends. You may feel safer but I’m in a state of constant terror for the Country.  If how I’m feeling now is how you felt under Obama, I’m sorry.
309 2018-07-07 17:44:20 Focused on stocks > $10
310 2018-07-07 17:43:47 Invest in secondary market, Buddy!! Many stocks have gone into value zone

314 2018-07-07 17:41:07 I think what I'll start doing is cash tag searching all of my tickers and blocking every single person who has anything negative or neutral to say about it, and then next time I search the ticker, all I will see is good stuff!! That helps the stock go up
315 2018-07-07 17:40:55 All the wisest people in the world chose to stay conceited, right?
316 2018-07-07 17:38:21 I love it when someone disagrees with another's opinion so they announce to everyone "BLOCKED" 
Lololol what a brave, heroic move! The person on the other end always suffers!!
317 2018-07-07 17:37:12 I have 7 stocks lined up to open on Monday. All pretty solid I think....LNC, IONS, EOG, VALE, NRG, CLR and LNG. I trade with x2 leverage and aim for 10-20% gains.
318 2018-07-07 17:36:17 One thing i'd love to see is a "tag team" mode where you play stocks with multiple characters on your team.

323 2018-07-07 17:29:35 There is no wrong answer though and I am focusing this on stocks >$10 i just ran out of characters! $NFLX could probably get that before it reports 7/16 AH lol
324 2018-07-07 17:28:16 I'm going to post the names of stocks >$10 in a googl doc and track it!
325 2018-07-07 17:25:59 just saw a very disrespectful snap of 3/4 lumbee ambassadors and i’m speechless. very immature.
326 2018-07-07 17:23:18 Thank you for all the wisdom you shared on penny stocks. Im assuming this applies to $MPX as well? I know they have printed 300M shares to date (dilution) and are currently under $1.00CAD. Is this one you are staying away from?
327 2018-07-07 17:23:06 How many of y’all are interested in learning to invest in stocks ??
328 2018-07-07 17:22:25 We was in bracket and dude left it on 3 stocks and we played then after he died and was at 50% he SD’d and said rules were wrong . Everybody said loser could have SD last stock lol you gotta hold that and I won...is that fair ?

333 2018-07-07 17:18:00 Just in case you’re looking for a house. #LA has about 100 $10mil plus houses for sale. Amazing anyone talks about stocks being overvalued. Low rates have made real estate ridiculous. This will change.
334 2018-07-07 17:16:26 For investors who are eager to get rich asap, such stocks sound boring
How foolish

339 2018-07-07 17:10:14 Nope. I have excellent stocks that did fantastic during Obama's tenure. Stagnant now.
340 2018-07-07 17:10:04 AH HAHAHAH! Evidently you don't have a DIME in stocks! Obama TRIPLED the Dow (That's 3X or 300% since your grasp of math is 0%) and it has raised 20% since Trumplethinskin took office.

346 2018-07-07 17:06:42 On a renouvelé les stocks xD
347 2018-07-07 17:05:58 This is a totally wrong approach! The power of a good analyst is not to give u one great pick. Its ability to give u a basket of stocks with good chances to break out. Never ask for just one pick. Ask for the five best ones and make five equal bets! It's hard learned truth
348 2018-07-07 17:05:12 $tsla #solar $sedg $nee our green energy stocks.
349 2018-07-07 17:01:44 Red states AZ, OK, FL,& ME have all passed gun control laws in <4 months. 6 states banned bump stocks w/ more pending. ~ 250K voters registered by a gun control lobby. Nationally televised protests almost every month. Seems like they're well on track to take all your guns away.
350 2018-07-07 17:01:25 A huge thank you to @friendsofmaps for organising a great fete today and to all of the children and families who came to support us. Mr N in the stocks was certainly popular!!
351 2018-07-07 17:00:44 Causal approach is fine. But the NRA must also get out of the way of sensible gun safety laws. Aren’t you guys still fighting bump stocks in some states?@MomsDemand @shannonrwatts
352 2018-07-07 16:59:56 My grandpa is the kind of person who doesn’t eat sweets but stocks his house full for his grandkids
353 2018-07-07 16:59:25 You should open a demo account (or your real acc. If you’re feeling feisty) and buy the stocks. You know, a fun little competition.
354 2018-07-07 16:59:10 Brawl had 3 stocks. JV 4 stock is when you 3 stock someone while taking no damage 
355 2018-07-07 16:57:40 If I was given a million dollars right now I would deadass save half in an interest bearing account, then invest a quarter of those savings into stocks/bonds, then live off the other half while working on doubling it... And paying taxes lol 
356 2018-07-07 16:57:22 @Yusetpozo overall index’s like soxx,qqq,spy,xrt have an affect also,if they are up,stocks in their sector go up unless news,and vice versa

365 2018-07-07 16:41:05 ok so please show me where there is an official report that bump stocks were used.

I'll save you the trouble, there isn't one. Bump stocks were found however NO linkage between guns found in the room to the victims has ever been released. 

U just posted, "Fake News".
366 2018-07-07 16:40:38 @HulkCapitalPro I looked at stocks in different sectors and the best charts I found: GILD, JNJ, CELG, NVS.
367 2018-07-07 16:40:11 If we're talking 0 knowledge of comp it would go to Melee because of the dominance of combos. As broken as MK was he still needed reads and such to destroy stocks. Comboing someone in Melee that doesn't know how to DI or escape is guaranteed stocks.
368 2018-07-07 16:39:21 And give their immediate family protection too... you know treat them like humans- or at least valued stocks?
369 2018-07-07 16:38:40 We also spend an unneeded ungodly amount of money on the largest military in the world; by far. Other countries are more sensible with their population's tax dollars.
Raytheon, McDonnell Douglas, Boeing & many others are good stocks to buy right now.

374 2018-07-07 16:35:14 I can't recommend specific stocks because it's not legal for me to do so. I instead give you the knowledge necessary (keeping in mind that I recommend numerous other books in that step and on my site to further that) to make the appropriate investments. It's all there for you.

380 2018-07-07 16:28:16 QOTD: If you had to pick 1 stock that you think had the best chance of going up at least 10% within the next 30 days what would your pick be? Note, once it hits 10%, you will set the stop there & if its hit you make 10%. Tight stop candidates (w/in 2%). #Stocks $SPX $NDX #TopPick

397 2018-07-07 16:07:39 Uranium One accounted for about 20% of U.S. production capacity. (This is different from the total stock of uranium.) The uranium stocks in the U.S. owned by Uranium One still remains in the U.S. 

The uranium is still under the same control as it always has been. 3/3
398 2018-07-07 16:05:52 It's worth looking at what other outstanding investors with long term track records have put real money to work in.   When other investors buys stocks, unlike Wall Street analysts, they have skin in the game.  That's not to say you still don't have to do your own work.

401 2018-07-07 16:04:27 Well unless there's some magic world where adults don't have to work in the summer then I'm betting the calls on July 5th were because some of the neighbors had to get up and go to work and would have enjoyed a decent nights sleep.
402 2018-07-07 16:04:08 I've been tempted to get something like this to help with my solo performances (when I eventually get some music made), I'll watch with interest what you think of it. My local DJ shop stocks these and will do me a discount I think.

410 2018-07-07 15:56:49 Go for "chance" trading in & out of your carefully chosen stocks, gradually increasing the "certainty" quantum of money made.....
411 2018-07-07 15:54:53 We spend more on loans .. but bank stocks are down...why..???

416 2018-07-07 15:49:38 Well isn’t it time to be cautious for near term.... market at peak is not likely to give extra ordinary return in near term... unless one is exceptionally awesome in detecting stocks like hdfc bank or Dmart and mind u that they were also not small caps....

420 2018-07-07 15:46:47 I just started it. I have heard good things. My goal is to read a ton of books. I have a whole file of about 200 books about trading/stocks/options/Forex/Futures I want to get through. I’m a sponge when it comes to trading information. If you want any, I will gladly share.
421 2018-07-07 15:45:38 What? SmallCap Stocks are growing at 8%? Unbelievable..

When was the last time that SmallCap growth was at that? 1960s? I know its been decades!!

So I do the deed
Get up and leave

423 2018-07-07 15:43:44 I do. focused re  type stocks, and their momentum - albeit some good, diverse stocks around which are cheap (US/UK banks).
424 2018-07-07 15:43:38 And the Crunchie audit has resulted in a need to increase stocks further to allow for accidental meltdown
425 2018-07-07 15:42:47 My friend got it for me :) the 2018 one released today. Not sure about stocks because last year a lot girls went and bought these  I’ll check the website and see if they have online purchase

429 2018-07-07 15:39:06 Where would the buyback index be without buybacks taking place is the question. A lot of companies do buybacks as financial engineering to cover up deteriorating businesses. Can’t find the link but stocks outperform for 90 days after buyback is announced.

432 2018-07-07 15:36:14 I guess reading really is fundamental...while the complaints were from May, the article stated that they were also called in the early hours of July 5th.
433 2018-07-07 15:34:17 CYRILLE: TRADING VS STOCKS HAHDHSHDHSHSHE
434 2018-07-07 15:33:28 Yeah, but...a narrow class of investors is ‘winning’ per commentary: “Small-cap stocks, which rely less on trade trends than large-cap stocks, in particular are hot lately, with the Russell 2000 up more than 9 percent for the year-to-date”
435 2018-07-07 15:31:32 Hi Andrew earlier this week it was quoted as 1/3 now its "only" a half First question can you confirm DFS Salary and a percentage for this cheap share purchase for this non producing aim company please ?
436 2018-07-07 15:30:23 When I come home my dad stocks up on all the same foods I used to eat as a kid and I love it 
437 2018-07-07 15:29:41 That’s my worry. The demand is way too high & supply of affordable homes continues to decline. many parents own more than 1 property. We may see our generation selling off and investing more in stocks and less in property, increasing supply and normalising the prices.. I hope so
438 2018-07-07 15:29:30 No. We’re trying to rebuild America’s foreign policy that @BarackObama seemed to destroy. No longer will we be laughing stocks or be bowing down. America First
439 2018-07-07 15:28:40 Not a guess at all. If you move a significant portion of a U.S. stock portfolio into bonds, you would dramatically reduce risk. If you moved it into international stocks, you'd reduce risk only a little, but the correlation between the two is so high.

455 2018-07-07 15:08:35 Such abrupt bans are most ridiculous. What will happen to the distributors/wholesalers/retailers who have stocked lots of goods for trade? Traders should be given at least 3 months to liquidate the existing stocks.

457 2018-07-07 15:07:13 Military weapons were the right of the people, was banned by the NFA, military look a-likes are no different than any other rifle, plus out of all murders 4% were rifles, less than 1% of that were AR-15 a statistical zero. Out of millions of bump stocks, one was ever used.

472 2018-07-07 14:46:58 Stocks are flat. Trumps policies are in effect as of jan 2018. They just do not know how bad it actually is yet. Once they do stocks will plumit and unemployment will skyrocket. If trump is given 8 years in office we will see another 2008 recession.

475 2018-07-07 14:40:16 AND? "Fake news" is DELIBERATE propaganda as put out by #FauxNewsPropagandaNetwork. Bias is not fabrication.

Maybe you "forgot" that the Vegas shooter used bump stocks, which essentially turn semi-automatic weapons into (less accurate) automatic weapons? And they're STILL legal?
476 2018-07-07 14:37:53 Are you focusing on basis point differences in expenses or percentage point differences in expected returns?

US Stocks (1928-2017)

Large Growth = +7.9%
Large Index = +9.6%

Large Value = +11.3%

494 2018-07-07 14:18:48 It's quite simple, if companies can earn a return greater than an individual investor, that's when the retention should/will happen. The principle of reinvestment. In stocks, capital appreciation is what matters not the dividends. Popular dividend theories also suggest the same.

522 2018-07-07 13:56:58 If you want to stay profitable, only trade what is on a upward trend. Sell when it starts to pullback. Move onto the next. Have no regrets even if the stocks runs up 10,000% after you sold. Because you can only work with what you have in the moment.

538 2018-07-07 13:49:02 @jimcramer Still don't understand having only 10 stocks in portfolio as portfolio wealth increases.Seems like too much risk. Help?
539 2018-07-07 13:46:43 A recession might happen in the next 12-24 months, but many of those same folks predicting, just missed some great gains. This past year was my best ever in stocks with over 25%. Just bought @Snap in $10.60's and @ATT at $31.75 to counter any  coming recession. T's dividend 6%!
540 2018-07-07 13:45:31 Who authored and passed the 2009 legislation that caused medical insurance stocks to increase sixfold, smartypants?
541 2018-07-07 13:45:10 Oh wait. That was my evil side talking.... stocks are going up up up, American hostages are being release, and well, the weather is still a bit crazy...
542 2018-07-07 13:45:07 The Wingston Superstore (2 in stock), the Loughborough Extra (5 in stock), the Bedworth Extra (6 in stock), the Loughborough Rushes Superstore (5 in stock). I cannot guarantee the stocks will be the same once you get there. :( 2/3
543 2018-07-07 13:43:36 No it's not. companies are still bailing and using their gains to buyback stocks, artificially keeping the market afloat. You're still a dotard.
544 2018-07-07 13:42:19 Ya! The economy is doing so bad since he got in. Stocks are plummeting, people are getting killed, Fire is literally falling from heaven!
545 2018-07-07 13:42:01 I’m mad too  plus I jwu with less hours of sleep and this is what I woke up to, they said “unlimited stocks” and they were “ready” bruuuuuuh unlimited stocks whereeee

551 2018-07-07 13:37:50 Instead of worrying about what policies dems will run on you could worry about:
-children being reunited
-corruption throughout the administration 
-fixing (not sabotaging) healthcare issues 
-banning bump stocks 
-#Listening to constituents
552 2018-07-07 13:37:24 Nice spin Steve. But what you failed to point out is that those who already have jobs have NOT received a raise above 2% which are few & far between. That same 2% top end that has existed for over 10yrs while company's buy back their stocks. So much for your GREAT TAX CUT
553 2018-07-07 13:36:44 I haven’t been in to stocks as long as you guys but something about it I love . It’s very interesting it works my mind . My profits are small as I learn but I transfer my gains and taking my family on our cruise with them .
554 2018-07-07 13:34:36 Before 1991 - hospital ward bed stocks 'belonged' to Consultants

In 1992 - responsibility for bed stock transferred to CEOs

This was then devolved into nursing

The Bed Manager era was born!

557 2018-07-07 13:33:01 So your betting choices are these for this football match:

- Bet on England to win
- Buy stocks in pharmaceutical companies that sell anti-depresants in the UK.
558 2018-07-07 13:32:42 Smaller starter positions...
Almost like your fishing and you leverage the bait to get a nibble, once u get a nibble you real in profit by doubling down positions....

This gives you a sense of stocks movements, while maintain risk management instilling a “trigger” for the trade.

562 2018-07-07 13:29:10 I love all these verifieds talking about how bad unpaid internships because it’s true. Now I want some theater folks to do the same for some equity Summer stocks where college kids actually pay like 5 grand to be interns...because that’s the biggest scam of all time imo
563 2018-07-07 13:28:03 I'm skeptical that leveraged micro-caps bought at 11-12x EBITDA would do far better in a downturn than a broader index comprised of many more stocks that are larger and less leveraged.
564 2018-07-07 13:26:23 What are those 3 stocks?
565 2018-07-07 13:24:44 Just invested in my first stocks, so stoked 
566 2018-07-07 13:24:13 Agree, but if I can easily find stocks that suit my trading style offshore, then this volatile, thin and fraught with problems JSE is a last choice.
567 2018-07-07 13:24:07 Stocks @ fresh 52-week high

HEG, Graphite India, Britannia, Jubilant FoodWorks, RBL Bank, Tata Elxsi, Infosys 0.02 %, Bata India and GSK Pharma.
568 2018-07-07 13:23:56 Stocks @ fresh 52-week high: As many as 15 stocks in the BSE 500 index scaled fresh 52-week high last week. The list included stocks such as V-Mart Retail, Tata Consultancy Services 1.74 %, Zydus Wellness, Zydus Wellness,
569 2018-07-07 13:23:47 Many stocks will be next graphite but the fact is 2018 is not for mid/smallcap..
570 2018-07-07 13:23:30 Whether I do or not is irrelevant. When Bitcoin floated it then became open to manipulation because stocks markets can be, and frequently are manipulated.

572 2018-07-07 13:22:00 Melting metal: Rising trade woes between the US and  other major economies hurt metal and mining stocks. The BSE Metal index  plunged the most 3.40 per cent on the BSE. Consumer durbales, power and  realty indices slipped up to 3.08 per cent.
573 2018-07-07 13:21:59 Very true. But people beg for black yeezys and when we get em they sit longer then others. Finally glad stocks = demand !! Makes me a happy wearer
574 2018-07-07 13:21:13 Additionally, sectors that are expected to underperform are IT,  metals and FMCG. Investors must follow a buy-on-dips strategy and  accumulate quality stocks in their portfolio for a long-term horizon.
575 2018-07-07 13:21:08 Well offshore has been giving me a lot of opportunities, there I can find stocks that suit my trading style. So do more of what works.
576 2018-07-07 13:19:15 Wish we would loose some. I’ve wanted to own these stocks!

581 2018-07-07 13:16:48 Nothing to do with an anti-Trump factor. They are significantly tech heavy.  Have you seen tech stocks in the last few years?
582 2018-07-07 13:16:28 im not sure if there's stocks left or not.. :(
583 2018-07-07 13:15:58 As a value investor, one should not look for which is obvious. If monsoon is good, the current prices already might have factored the same. Do you really think that this is information edge? Those days are gone. You shouldn't buy a stocks based on next 3 months.
584 2018-07-07 13:13:22 Doesn’t go far enough. The online short-term accommodation industry has to be impacting on long-term accommodation stocks.

669 2018-07-07 11:51:07 If you want to invest in lower risk, more mature stocks that’s fine, that’s your choice. There are many here that want to take an early position and make bigger gains at a higher risk that’s fine too. Part of that is trying to assess potential mc if a resource is found.
670 2018-07-07 11:48:40 Have you ever owned any mining stocks? I’m just curious if you have looked at $GCM.TO. Trades around 2x EV/EBITDA with no analyst coverage and growing production / FCF. They burned investors last cycle so no forgiveness yet!

676 2018-07-07 11:41:06 Analysts recommendations globally and particularly in India are directly correlated to high PE, PB, Price to Sales and Price to Cash Flows while inversely correlated to Dividend Yield.

681 2018-07-07 11:30:49 20 years ago when I was just 13 years, my plan was to acquire a large portfolio of dividend paying stocks & live off the dividends.  In 2008, I learned that I needed to add a method for reducing risk.  In 2015, I discovered trading and the puzzle was completed. #BigPictureThink

688 2018-07-07 11:20:33 All stocks follow Bitcoin's basic pattern, starts at 0, people get ahead of themselves, reach a frenzy, crash to about 50% of what the trendline should be following, everyone gets burned for being greedy, suppressed line until the vets build up and start up the cycle all over.

697 2018-07-07 11:12:41 Ross stocks up but the USD was down almost with all other currencies. If USD moves down the purchasing power of all that upside is worthless. This is why in devaluating currencies interest rates are higher to offset the inflation since the actual paper money has less value.

788 2018-07-07 08:20:53 First, "assault wepon" is not the same as "assault rifle." You still haven't defined what guns you mean when you say "assault weapon." Second, bump stocks do not mimic select fire, they mimic full auto. MIMIC. A bump stock on a gun still does not make it shoot with (1/2)

791 2018-07-07 08:16:40 The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. This point cannot be overemphasized. Every year finds a spate of books on how to pick stocks or find the winning mutual fund. But all this good information is useless without the willpower.
792 2018-07-07 08:16:06 While I was looking for a starter for my circular bulb (in my closet since I have stocks of those stuff, don't judge me), I found a pair of earphones I bought last year. Unboxed but still unused. Tested it. It sounds superb. I think the brand's Modocee.

794 2018-07-07 08:12:25 Pull up a 40-yr chart of companies like Navistar (NAV) and AMD. Tell me at what point in their 40-yr history they were "cheap". That's right, they have never been cheap because they are capital destroyers. The long-term trend (in USD) is down. Now apply that to most EM stocks.

811 2018-07-07 07:52:37 Chanos is a smart person.  But his long-term relative performance highlights how shorting is a very tough business.  I don't think shorting as a primary strategy works.  Opportunistic shorting may add some value.  But you have to short weak companies and not "overvalued" stocks.

930 2018-07-07 04:45:08 As one of those from the South I can tell you that it’s the seniors who are old for their age, Evangelicals and watch their stocks every day. The rest of us are anything but Trumpsters and are definitely not hanging out with old people!!!
931 2018-07-07 04:42:58 Made it out at 7th in dubs tonight with my boy J24, I still detest doubles. Also took like 10 stocks with my Bowser in a crews match I played lol.

940 2018-07-07 04:35:32 Yeah, liked how trading cryptos was so much easier than stocks. Been reading on TAs and trying out few things. Gotta say, learning how to trade is becoming increasingly more expensive than my grad school tuition fees :)
941 2018-07-07 04:30:01 What may happen to or how will Chinese stocks perform in US market when the actual war starts?
942 2018-07-07 04:25:17 Stocks can only go up so fast for so long. Their stock is still far above and beyond where it was before switch launched.
943 2018-07-07 04:24:21 Last month I sold the last of my Chinese stocks, too much #TrumpTariffs risk. I’m holding on to all US and ignoring #trump for now. 19% of $nvda biz w/China, so they can weather it, since no #gpu substitutes.

950 2018-07-07 04:20:17 How to do the whole trading stocks thing.  I've read up on it and tried to figure it out, but economic stuff is definitely not my forte!  Oh, unless it can be something magical, then something like immortality or befriending every animal!

1055 2018-07-07 01:48:05 Trump KNOWS this. That is why Trump's  company is SHORTING STOCKS like there's no tomorrow. For those who don't know what "shorting stocks" means, it means to to place a BET on the stock market that a company's will go DOWN. When that stock goes DOWN, TRUMP gets RICHER!
1056 2018-07-07 01:46:34 Ya they sell out quickly. Most of the time when @BHOAdventures stocks them they are gone within an hour. A few times within 15 minutes. So when you see he's stocking get ready and be on his site at 8 pm central time and add to cart and check out asap

. I have been observing stocks like $GEVO, $AXON, $GBR, etc, low float stocks, will it work to short swing these trades, risking its all time high during the move? appreciate your views.

1073 2018-07-07 01:21:30 Initial takeaways from trading stocks as opposed to crypto: 
1. man it's nice to have a market-close time for a change.
2. eliminating the threat of a -30% 15-min candle is pretty relaxing im not gonna lie.

1095 2018-07-07 00:49:47 Alot of the money the tax cuts gave to companies were used for stock buy backs that artificially boost the price of their stocks and boost the economy over all but that can cause over inflation.

1103 2018-07-07 00:42:06 Whatever happened to bump stocks? Doesn't that debate seem like forever ago?
1104 2018-07-07 00:41:50 If that makes zero sense to you, then you shouldn’t be investing in stocks. Good luck with that curiosity.

1117 2018-07-07 00:30:31 Wrong again. Stocks are not entering bear market and correlation has been and still is about zero, but go put a correlation spread trade and go broke. Always baffled by the fallacies crypto crowds believe in.

1120 2018-07-07 00:29:27 ...5. Bump Stocks are banned.
6.  Red flag laws are suspect as hell, which you simply need to play out in your head to understand why.
7. I really like the idea of mandatory licensing/training.
8. Registration is a NO GO.
9. Insurance maybe, I like what the NRA does.
1121 2018-07-07 00:28:44 Thanks, staying humble given these markets.  Good to see $SILVER stocks are ignoring asset price declines and leading the way.  We have a long way to go in this move, as it’s only just begun.
1122 2018-07-07 00:18:04 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..

1131 2018-07-08 23:56:09 Giving tax cuts to 1/2 country already wealthy & corporations w/ pre- existing conditions of record profits who used $ to buy back stocks no use to 1/2 country w/o investments & taking away pre-existing med conditions+Medicare/ Medicaid to pay for other 1/2 inexplicable.
1132 2018-07-08 23:55:37 Define " Great " please.
So far, all I've seen is corporations buying back stocks, and NO increase in wages, nor the inflation rate go down.

So.... How is this making America Great ?

1169 2018-07-08 23:32:59 Allow me to translate: If unions have lost power to negotiate standards for wages and benefits, it leaves that duty to corporate hiring boards who mainly care about profitability. As wages and benefits decrease, stocks will go up and Trump will brag more about the economy.
1170 2018-07-08 23:31:27 The audacity is astounding. 0% chance he owns 0 stocks.

1187 2018-07-08 23:14:22 Not sure you can compare Einhorn to Soros in terms of their long-term results.  In my view, Einhorn doesn't follow an optimal approach and so will inevitably have issues.  For example, shorting stocks based on them being too "expensive."  I like Einhorn as a person though.
1188 2018-07-08 23:13:24 The only time the Dow was over trendline was for a brief melt-up that collapsed into a correction it hasn't recovered from. The Nasdaq and S&P are hanging onto a few tech stocks holding value

1195 2018-07-08 23:01:04 I also know someone that concentrated a big chunk of his portfolio in oil and gas pipeline MLP stocks because they were tax efficient and ignored sector weighting, commodity prices, & other issues.

Montgomery Securities was responsible for commercializing EPO in Europe.

1285 2018-07-08 21:26:31 It would be more. The cash value kn ur insurance policies are the same stocks bonds and mutual funds you can buy outside of them. How do i know, i manage the investments in peoples insurance policies. If u bought the exact stuff minus the fees you’d have more money.

1299 2018-07-08 21:05:04 I got a large bonus once and one of my friends asked what I was going to buy with it. Gadget, stocks, or a case of tennis balls. I get a weird look and she tells me I really need new shoes. Another friend told me that she was glad my 16-year-old work shirt got a huge hole in it.

1306 2018-07-08 20:55:38 Disregarding the specific stocks in play today isn't this sort of selective bear market exactly what we want to see as a long-term normal versus business cycle style collapses? This is one of those moments when the expansion of volatility and nth moment products appears fruitful.
1307 2018-07-08 20:55:18 I was talking about the big stocks in bio are the buyers of small bios. So higher there stock price move they can buy.

1309 2018-07-08 20:54:34 I think that people would be way happier with Nintendo's e3 direct if they hadnt announced smash bros back in march. Imagine tuning in to e3 and--surprise!--its smash.

Heck, stocks would probably have gone UP if they hadnt revealed it earlier.

1316 2018-07-08 20:47:35 Don't let ppl guilt you in feeling bad for not owning stocks either. The lack of exposure is not due mostly to your individual doing but more so the major players/stakeholders who haven't done enough to educate.

Hope I haven't done so, unintentionally of course.

1340 2018-07-08 20:25:53 Opinion: No matter what way I look at it China is going to suffer. If it's 50 billion a yr. less in trade or 100 Chinese investors are feeling the pain & it will continue . Gold & other metals will suffer from demand short term . Related stocks will have a high chance of EPS miss

1372 2018-07-08 19:43:33 Regular Testing is very key. Dischem stocks self test kits. Both partners have to test them try the ABC. It’s safer both know their status. The plan how to live depending on the results..

1374 2018-07-08 19:41:18 My notion from #McCallUsury (or somewhere else?), is that corporate bonds more resemble stocks than loans. Don't know yet about government bonds, but don't think that buying them is usury.
1375 2018-07-08 19:39:02 Scum. I hope they find them all and put them in the stocks.
1376 2018-07-08 19:37:00 Do you think that in the next year there will be crisis like in 2008? I'm wondering if it is good time to start investing in stocks or to wait.

1383 2018-07-08 19:30:09 The more I read about stocks the more political it seems
1384 2018-07-08 19:29:39 True, but if you think of it with that mindset it'll all go in a year. You need to invest it into stocks and properties to actually make use of it. Only keep 500k and the rest should be for investments and a house which fits your family.

1411 2018-07-08 19:01:18 It's not just tax, and we have to consider the wider implications of the term "worth". Obviously things like mineral rights (inc oil, coal, gas), fresh water, land (a lot of that is *not* in Scottish hands), fish stocks, renewable energy potential,  etc etc.

1431 2018-07-08 18:48:01 Market action summary – News has been poor. Market stopped going down before the 4th. Thursday and Friday were good days. Sector strength eveident in Chinese stocks, Biotech, Energy & IBD 50. EPS season starts in earnest Friday the 13th. 
1432 2018-07-08 18:46:06 everything will be alright but one needs to know the time and levels. I never ever bought PSU Banks but now, I am bullish on these coz I was looking at the filth, which is getting cleaned now. You will know in few years time. Institutions are bound to buy nifty stocks :)

1436 2018-07-08 18:45:02 I’m pleased with Kane tbh, he was the only one 100% gurenteed starter. Plus he had a similar personality to Southgate
1437 2018-07-08 18:42:22 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $MET, $PACW, $RJF, $ZION, all may climb w/in 25, 17, 22, 12 days up to 3.8%, 4.5%, 8.7%, 2.9% respectively

1439 2018-07-08 18:40:49 Our primary yardsticks for the economy are the stock market and the jobs report.  But the stock market really only applies to well-off people, because poor people don't own stocks.  And the jobs report is meaningless if it takes multiple jobs for working-class people to get by.
1440 2018-07-08 18:40:30 luh mga bes kahit ilan stocks ko sold out pa rin agad kapressure 
1441 2018-07-08 18:38:38 She's right and we will. Imagine what that will do to out of favour, high yielding defensive stocks.
1442 2018-07-08 18:38:01 Yeah he’s a proper leader. Even when he’s not captain he’s the one spurring everyone on! Nothing against Kane but hendo should be the captain!
1443 2018-07-08 18:37:49 Lots of sale items in Robinsons Magnolia. 

I can only window shop really. The stocks aren't so nice. Stuffs in 21men aren't what you see online.

1451 2018-07-08 18:33:10 I don’t know how to find a broker that allows me do long and short I used global futures as my broker company for two years and it didn’t work with a lot of stocks.

1456 2018-07-08 18:32:03 Was unfortunately in the 5th row for the England vs Costa Rica warm up game but it gave me a different perspective. All I could hear was him leading, talking people through the game. He was a joy to watch. Especially with so many young’uns in there.
1457 2018-07-08 18:30:29 Look for stocks that are making new price highs as they break out of proper, correct bases.
1458 2018-07-08 18:30:17 the GOP wants a crash, because their donors want a crash.  A crash allows them to swoop in and buy up stocks, real estate, etc. at rock bottom prices, thus widening the wealth gap even further.

1463 2018-07-08 18:19:57 The bloke from @ASI on @BBCCountryfile is the sort of person that should be put in the stocks and have low grade "free trade" shite fired at him from a cannon. One word for him - TWAT
1464 2018-07-08 18:19:40 @marcorubio Re-watching the CNN town hall after MSD shooting. You vowed to work to make sure it never happens again. What work have you done? Where are federal bills to limit assault rifles and bump stocks? To ensure background checks on every gun transfer?  What have YOU done?

1469 2018-07-08 18:17:16 So, YC, after its 1st purchase of 8.1 M lbs, should have about $30,000,000 to spend.  Also, Yellow Cake will store its load of uranium in Canada at Cameco’s "Port Hope" and "Blind River." Then they say that it is looking to invest in U Royalty assets. So, not a buyer of stocks?
1470 2018-07-08 18:16:46 Yeah precisely! He’s a right unsung hero for England. Been quality this World Cup. Like you say typical England fans cos he’s not scoring or saving goals they don’t care about him! Record speaks for itself

1505 2018-07-08 17:50:05 The bank stocks tumbling is result of insiders who understand the global financial system upon foundation of sand.

They are cashing out.

These primary banks across the globe swapping tier 1/2 assets quarterly w/ federal reserve also speaks volumes regarding fragility

1556 2018-07-08 17:02:00 It has to be a dull, boring phase IMO which leads to a rounded bottom instead of V shape bottom. V shape bottom in a correction like this happens mostly in Stocks, a perfect V bottom will only signal me a temporary bottom such as seen in Februay 6th ++
1557 2018-07-08 17:01:57 SHS gets ss protection because she is asked to leave restaurant because the owner doesn't like her lack of morals, not her politics, SB calls cops for being called trash but grieving parents from a school shooting ask for banned bump stocks and get thoughts and prayers. WTF?

1559 2018-07-08 17:01:43 Even bonds could tank if US credit rating sinks. 

Although if stocks tank investors go to bonds. Plus the fed usually cuts rates. And if we get deflation bonds hold value. But hopefully none of that happens.
1560 2018-07-08 17:00:49 I remember discussing with someone about ipo, and thought that the boys would be able to buy/get stocks and many said that they arnt allowed? I keep on wondering where this information is from because it seems to be a slight consensus within this fandom but I can’t find anything

1570 2018-07-08 16:49:51 Stocks are safer than Defined Contribution (DC) assets. It is clear when a stock has trouble and you can take action.  Whereas you are stuck when a DC asset falls apart. Ultimately I agree with you and the whining will be endless when this guy gets stung.

1572 2018-07-08 16:48:36 500 people weren't shot; Most guns are semi-auto, which makes this an irrelevant statement; statistics have proven that having a mother and father in the home give children better odds of success; bump stocks should be illegal without proper licenses/fees.

1576 2018-07-08 16:45:58 What would common sense changes be in you're eyes? If it is banning bump stocks, you are blind to went they are and how little they are used.... background checks are already in place..
1577 2018-07-08 16:45:31 If I recall..  health insurer's stocks started going up as soon as ACA was announced.  Everyone knew the ACA would lead to higher profits.  

The only real solution is to bring costs down, not argue over who pays for it.
1578 2018-07-08 16:45:16 If only the 57-year-old man in Las Vegas who shot 500 people and killed 58 with semiautomatic rifles and bump stocks had had nicer parents.

1615 2018-07-08 16:09:06 Very true, In total support to a brightly given healthy facts! Late meals and close to bedtime do not get easily digested and processed worse still, going to bed soon after food stocks calories instead of burning others. A risk to NCDs and a burden to health.
1616 2018-07-08 16:08:02 Technically, regular parents with bump stocks (maybe in their IRAs or 401ks?) can be just as bad so your core premise is null and void, I guess?

1667 2018-07-08 15:15:24 I think this is related to share market, when stocks will go up then sign is 'bull' & stocks is go down then sign is 'bear'.
1668 2018-07-08 15:15:04 That’s what is known as Great stocks vs Great Companies. For example Amazon is     a Great Company but at $800 B valuation is it a Great Stock ? I don’t know .....

1673 2018-07-08 15:11:18 Do you believe in buying stocks 'low' and selling them 'high'? Then you should have been around on this day in 1932 when the Dow fell to the lowest level of the Great Depression: 41.22. On Friday, the Dow closed at 24,456. IF you'd only known, right?

1680 2018-07-08 15:02:31 Is the 2% stop an intraday thing or 2% daily loss? I personally base my stop losses on daily closing levels and not intraday. Tons of stocks go down 2% intraday but then recover above that mark by the close. I will abide by the rules regardless but just curious for clarity sake.

1702 2018-07-08 14:40:43 My current trading strategy is to concentrate on a handful of stocks.  Only the best of the best.  Also to compound profits on these stocks wherever possible. Lots to learn, but having goals (and good teachers) will help, I'm sure!  $SPX $QQQ
1703 2018-07-08 14:38:45 Exactly, no criminal record or mental health concerns until after the shooting. This is why we need to ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
1704 2018-07-08 14:36:06 sure... no accountability there , either... they can do what they want. In stocks, c-level executives often have restrictions on selling shares of their own company.
1705 2018-07-08 14:36:01 Or how a recession is going for us because poor people will be able to afford some stocks.  #Cult45 backwards logic.
1706 2018-07-08 14:34:00 In Japan, there is some net-net stocks. But, they are not very attractive because they do not return to shareholders, then cash is accumulated...
1707 2018-07-08 14:33:31 I see inflation everywhere, maybe it's just me? ecological food, gas, coffe, services, housing, stocks, classic cars, boat prices, public transport, hair dressers etc.
1708 2018-07-08 14:33:20 I don't think living the second amendment applies to the gun nutters with a bunker filled with AR -15 weapons with bump stocks and thousands of rounds of ammo..
But Dana Loesch and the NRA think they are normal decent people.
1709 2018-07-08 14:33:03 The ‘headline’ risk to chip stocks due to China trade issues is large and accelerating by the day. There is no de-escalation on the horizon and I feel it will get worse before it gets better, so the stocks still have more downside risk.

1717 2018-07-08 14:24:32 When I’m bearish and I sell a stock, each sale must be at a lower level than the previous sale. When I am buying, the reverse is true. I must buy on a rising scale. I don’t buy long stocks on a scale down, I buy on a scale up.

1724 2018-07-08 14:15:17 Brit Hume's post confirms my suspicion, that the wall street hierarchy has been scamming the markets for the last eleven months,  using lame excuses to trash stocks when reporting improved earnings/forecasts for most U.S companies. Political or what?, talk about illegal collusion
1725 2018-07-08 14:13:25 That's what I was thinking. Domestic securitisation of industry has as large an effect -- in prior times, industry magnate families' fortunes would wax and wane, but now it's easy to diversify by allocating savings to stocks, bonds, and perhaps most importantly, MFs/HFs/ETFs.
1726 2018-07-08 14:13:25 I hate seeing how much my check is before taxes, retirement and buying stocks. Like fuck being a responsible adult.

1731 2018-07-08 14:09:29 I fail to see how ‘exports stalled’ and soybean and pork producers getting kicked in the balls, will equal ‘America has the most to gain.’ The only investments that will be temporarily unscathed will be US small company stocks with no foreign exposure. Few and far between.

1736 2018-07-08 14:01:23 Since the Permian Basin is red hot and growing like crazy, what penny oil stocks are going to go nuts? Any ideas?
1737 2018-07-08 13:59:20 I probably sit in the "engaged and motivated" camp when it comes to individual stocks, though I own very few and usually hold for less than a year. Holding a significant amount of a single stock feels like a game of hot potato to me  Indexes and bonds take up most of my folio!

1739 2018-07-08 13:55:53 Ah ok. Helpful feedback. But yes they’re a respected, mid tier brokerage that historically covered bank and financial stocks. Got acquired by Alliance something-or-other and dropped the “Sanford”

1741 2018-07-08 13:55:38 It would also be great if we can reduce people’s dependency on large grocery stores and instead encourage smaller grocery stores within sub-areas that can provides fresh foods, because wastage happen when we buy large stocks from hypermarket.

1817 2018-07-08 12:23:30 They provide a lot of information to their self-organized protection scheme, and to supervisory authorities as well (where required). However, they aren't issuing any tradeable securities (such as stocks or bonds), and are rarely selling securitized assets to the public.

1835 2018-07-08 12:01:52 @davidhogg111 " I’m pro 2A & gunsense " When did you take this stance and how do you define it? (i.c. banning rifles, semi-automatic firearms, standard mags and bump stocks plus higher taxes, removing rights 18-21..) Is this you?
1836 2018-07-08 12:00:33 Nonsense, such an idiotic thought, warren buffet, porunju, rakesh jhunjhunwala, rk damani these guys has built wealth by investing long term. My own investment in stocks for the last 5 years has given me a return of more than 100%
1837 2018-07-08 12:00:14 That is really a key point.  If one goes through the file of 70 stock charts that WON marked up in detail and put in newspaper-you see over and over again that the model stocks formed long, proper bases during corrections.  Those 70 charts/articles are a model book from him to us

1861 2018-07-08 11:20:46 You dont know facts. Unemployment went up last month for the first time since Obama was in office. Job creation was higher under Obama. GDP 2015 higher. Stocks grew faster. Trump was handed a great economy that he is actually making worse.

Banking- use different banks (ex. Bank1 = main deposits, bank 2 = Christmas fund).
1871 2018-07-08 10:59:15 ALL my loses this year have been on stocks that in hindsight were a great trade but should have been treated as that. If I had of taken the profit or part at least my portfolio would be much healthier.
1872 2018-07-08 10:54:00 When you look at a chart, ask yourself:

1. Where has price been?
2. Where is it likely to go?
3. What’s the risk if you’re wrong?
4. What’s the reward if you’re right?
You want to look left to plan right.

1880 2018-07-08 10:45:34 It's 2 out of 10 stocks *correction *
1881 2018-07-08 10:44:36 10 out of 2 stocks might have performed in long term.  Anything less than 10 yrs is a speculation in my view. 
Only consumer products did well
Exceptions are IT and Pharma did well coz of exports and decline in INR.

The uranium is still under the same control and export restrictions as it always has been. 12/13

1978 2018-07-08 07:23:13 Keep an eye on this. It will be a good indicator on which stocks to avoid.

2002 2018-07-08 06:48:02 Gotta go underdog Croatia ... but ... Russia v England would send defense stocks thru the roof! Also, biotechs to deal with the inevitable poisoning aftermath. Then laboratory/testing facilities to deal with the Ruskies ongoing doping. Woulda been bank. Alas.
2003 2018-07-08 06:47:35 Sir @profit_raining can u teach us how do you short list the stocks?
2004 2018-07-08 06:46:30 But I found out I suck at re-buying the same stocks as they don't often provide as nice volatility contraction as they did on my initial entry. They just turn out of blue and slip through my fingers. The fewer decisions I have to make, the better. Fortunately, patience is my edge
2005 2018-07-08 06:43:25 Have generally thought Oz banks are cheap relative to growth stocks if you take a benign view of Oz house prices and are sceptical of major disruptions in mortgage market (as I do/am). We’ll see!

2011 2018-07-08 06:36:42 His allocation changes drastically but I know, few stocks he holds where holding period is more than 2 years, with good allocation.  His strategy is not Buy and Hold. Strategy is buy and rotate.

2014 2018-07-08 06:26:12 I really hope the boys get stocks in bh because it'll be so unfair if they don't. It's obvious that they're the reason bh earns money and if they don't get a share of that wealth apart from their salaries. Hhhhh. Idk.
2015 2018-07-08 06:26:07 Stocks which are not widely covered are given to new analyst who have not seen complete earning cycle. They are mostly interested in 1yr/ 2 yr fwd projection and publishing reports in  few hours. Going wrong on such stocks won't hurt institution name.
2016 2018-07-08 06:25:55 If only the 57-year-old man in Las Vegas who shot 500 people and killed  58 with semiautomatic rifles and bump stocks had had nicer parents.
2017 2018-07-08 06:24:09 Agree with that. What i do is in a portfolio of 10 stocks (say) churn the lowest returning 2 stocks every year or so depending on certain other factors as well, while accumulating more in others. Is this similar to the idea you are trying to get across?

2022 2018-07-08 06:18:21 That's why I kept 80% of portfolio in liquid funds. Not a single Rs. investment in small cap stocks !
2023 2018-07-08 06:17:04 I see too many guns.
Too many assault rifles.
Lack of training and reckless handling.
Ban-em!  Ban all assault rifles!
Ban bump stocks. 
That’s my 2cents.

3. I also consider nifty trend as most of stocks trend with nifty.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

2028 2018-07-08 06:09:36 Theres alot of white schools that teach finance, taxes& stocks as an average part of the curriculum. Its normal. For us(or me) its limited to special courses, if said courses are even available at ur school. By the time real life comes into play, they already have an advantage
2029 2018-07-08 06:09:21 It is a problem now because the guns available then are not the same guns available today. PLUS no one is trying to take away guns from sane, law abiding citizens. Gun Control is about enforcing the background checks & taking bump stocks out of the civilian market.
2030 2018-07-08 06:08:58 @BMTheEquityDesk 
Sir it’s extremely confusing to built a long term portfolio. Stock that are high quality are very expensive and stocks that are cheap are low on quality. How to identify long term compounders and what price to buy.

2033 2018-07-08 06:01:07 Because, Justice, they are exhibition teams not professional teams.  Thats like asking why Ford stocks are worth $55 while Tesla stoks are $285.  You are comparing apples and oranges.  Exhibition teams make more than the WNBA the lowest paid employee makes more than Aja

That leaves 25% unless he unloads some b4 IPO. 2. Bang stated he will offer stocks to BH employees for being loyal & hardworking at lower $. ++

2076 2018-07-08 04:53:41 Active is 13.7% of Foreign Stocks, totals $48bn (which is big enough).
Japan equities, active is ~9.6%, US$35.4bn. 
In Japan bonds, active is 23.3%, $92.9bn.
Foreign Bonds:  6.3% and $9bn.

I expect active to rise (slowly) in foreign and dom stocks under the new incentive scheme.

2193 2018-07-08 02:17:32 just means more cash to buyback stocks at inflated prices. Nothing for the workers. Nothing that lowers prices. Empty economic plan based on Koch/Mercer stealing from workers to make capital owners richer.

2204 2018-07-08 02:07:06 My taxes weren't that much different from last year. Also haven't seen much in raises, bonuses, or incentives. More than likely big companies kept most of the tax breaks or bought back stocks to make themselves richer.

2226 2018-07-08 01:42:36 Would a long term decline in housing investment have any impact on the stock market? My thinking is it would redirect investors to dividend stocks.

Plenty of people in full/partial cash ATM too so another correction may see them returning to stocks.

Thoughts?

2228 2018-07-08 01:39:44 If you are following the national conversation at all, which it seems like you aren't, banning guns is not what anyone is talking about. Ideas being promoted are background checks, red flag laws, waiting periods, ban bump stocks. Also, it's easier to buy a gun than drive a car.

2230 2018-07-08 01:38:18 The Great Distractor!! Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Shame on you, Donald Trump!!

2330 2018-07-06 23:33:31 ....and US stocks (+0.88%) and Soybeans (+4.61%) rallied all day without stopping.  looks good to me too!
2331 2018-07-06 23:32:41 and that might be exactly what Trump's backers/manipulators are planning on doing. "Say you r going to do something terrible, while I short stocks, and then, find a reason to say that the opponent acquiessed and you're taking the steps back. Perhaps it's all a market play?
2332 2018-07-06 23:32:27 I wish I had the money to buy stocks 5 years ago. We would’ve been banking

why mine not working ? stocks on black screen
2334 2018-07-06 23:29:58 So are you going to buy more undisclosed stocks in companies and have the government hand them billions of dollars which you will get in dividends again? #5TIMESMOSTCORRUPT
2335 2018-07-06 23:29:43 You mean diversification of project A into project B is a bad thing? Is this why oil companies buy each other’s stocks? Your example is more than extreme. Also I have not seen ICOs do this.. it against the money grab culture.. also poor game theory
2336 2018-07-06 23:29:24 No doubt Mr. Sykes is the truth hands down I have read his books and watched his videos...He is basically giving us everything we will ever need to profit from penny stocks practically for free if your not blind enough to see!...This guy doesn’t have to tell us shit yet he is!...
2337 2018-07-06 23:26:47 Thanks for tips Nick. I find the hardest part about trading is finding the right stocks to trade..Im struggling in this area. Its a work in progress I need to improve

2339 2018-07-06 23:26:01 When picking my stocks, i analysed the entire stock along with hundreds of others, and that's why i know all 12 i picked won't flop
2340 2018-07-06 23:25:49 If stocks crash, USD will moon....If USD crashes and enters into a currency crisis, then Gold and Crypto will likely moon. People will be desperate to buy whatever they can to off load depreciating dollars. IMO.

 - DOW JONES (24 456,48)0.41% +99,74

2344 2018-07-06 23:20:00 2. Someone moving $20mm between, say, publicly traded stocks, bonds, and cash in the bank is also certainly not investing.  Nothing they do will have any impact on the real economy and the money will never flow through to real economic actors- it just gets shuffled around.

2354 2018-07-06 23:09:17 Hi Julius, Thanks for sharing useful information of RRG chart. Is it possible to use RRG chart to identify when to move to cash i.e, if fully invested in Stocks and if the momentum is weakening then move to cash. In such scenarios which symbols to use in the RRG chart. Thanks.

2356 2018-07-06 23:03:47 I'm just the bastard who stocks the limes I don't control what we order or when it shows up.
2357 2018-07-06 23:03:22 Trans girls are actual girls because your gender identity is not determined by what's in your pants.

Some trans girls have a penis and others don't, so there's no reason transness should be a deal breaker if there only concern is not liking dick.

Is your space bar broken?

Research Signals - June 2018

Relative to most global equity markets, US investors maintained a more positive outlook as earnings have held up amid trade tensions. However, US stocks have not been able to support sentiment globally, confirm…
2364 2018-07-06 22:55:31 More reasons to confirm that stock market does not follow economic news. Tariffs? Check! Low productivity? Check! Asset bubbles? Check! Wage stag? Check! Inflation? Check! Market is still resting their hope on leader who wants to invade Venezuela. #trump #stocks #venezuela #mkt
2365 2018-07-06 22:55:02 Yeah its not decentralised if its not being traded in a decentralised manner, buy IBM stocks

2371 2018-07-06 22:49:17 Couple stocks I been looking into still trying to understand
2372 2018-07-06 22:48:40 Stocks could be down for a number of reasons...one that we've a lunatic at the helm. I don't think warren is out for herself, and i think overregulations could be necessary to wake people up.  Right now, trump has taken away all consequences of bad behavoir.
2373 2018-07-06 22:47:52 Stocks -keep an eye on #SEE #VAST #AOR and #OPTI. Lots of potential.

We've been sitting down staring while people around us are discussing the properties they own/want to buy, calling the various doctors they know and stocks they're trading
2375 2018-07-06 22:44:41 And yet stocks climb.....
2376 2018-07-06 22:44:33 if ever there was a time for stocks, this is it.
2377 2018-07-06 22:44:22 Do you have any stocks in the town center where you can shackle Trump for a day or two?? 
2378 2018-07-06 22:43:14 whats not being said is that some of the weapons were illegally converted to machineguns and not with bump stocks.
2379 2018-07-06 22:42:51 ... Wilbur Ross is the one with the most exposure, his short selling of stocks ...
2380 2018-07-06 22:42:35 You are right Ajaya, Opportunity in India is much beyond the stocks.
2381 2018-07-06 22:40:30 reading @kamalravikant book: Live Your Truth - wow, just wow 
2382 2018-07-06 22:40:21 "Save 10% of your paycheck, put it away in some slow growth stocks or mutual funds, wait 50 years, and you'll be the richest person...in the cemetery." #investing #Marketing #makemoneyonline #OnlineMarketing #AffiliateMarketing #makemoneyfromhome #hustle #affiliate
2383 2018-07-06 22:40:14 Do you have that list of companies involved in the refugee rejections and family separations?  Middle class America needs to be able to tell its mutual fund managers which stocks to dump.

2385 2018-07-06 22:38:26 So you don’t know how much he put in and how much he returned, correct? He may be 10 per cent owner, he may be 100 per cent. They may be hugely successful, or bank stocks could have been a better investment.
2386 2018-07-06 22:38:22 so she doesn’t own or trade any stocks/securities?!?
2387 2018-07-06 22:38:16 Stocks did good too so I guess it isnt so bad
2388 2018-07-06 22:34:46 So what's one thing that the trump admin has done that's has benefited the masses. his tax breaks helped rich companies buy back stocks, NK is still producing nuclear weapons, there is no wall or funding for it and the EPA chief he hired just had to resign because of scandals.1/2
2389 2018-07-06 22:31:34 I need more stocks of twitter
2390 2018-07-06 22:31:32 Subdued wage growth = Fed will only hike gradually. High employment growth = demand is solid. Both positive for stocks.
2391 2018-07-06 22:30:22 But where's the relationship that links reducing AB plaques to disease modifying? I don't get it. Out of the 244 agents tested, there's only 0.4% bc the rest failed. And all of them where AB related . 
Oh, and I just added $AXON bc it's was a chart on AD's stocks 
2392 2018-07-06 22:30:14 Investers is who I was thinking of- stocks, bonds, $$$...
2393 2018-07-06 22:28:55 People won't leave him alone about this. He dared ask a question on social media, they couldn't wait to punish him for it Heaven forbid anyone dissent or disagree even slightly. Twitter attacks! It's worse than the Puritans and the stocks.
2394 2018-07-06 22:26:31 They say patience is a virtue, that’s why i’m controlling stocks.
2395 2018-07-06 22:25:46 When Obama wanted to disarm Americans his side kick Susan Rice bought a ton of stocks for both of them in gun and ammunition manufactures.
2396 2018-07-06 22:25:20 Not really, as the middle eastern oil barons not considered. Ps. @MarkZuckerbe1rg only worth that on paper because of all the idiots buying fakebook worthless stocks.........
2397 2018-07-06 22:25:18 Esa ya rompió hacr unos días....
2398 2018-07-06 22:24:53 Markets have all different price ranges because less valuable seats will always sell for less money. Same with homes or stocks. Or thousands of other products that flux on a scale of value. It's just how our world works. If a price doesn't work, it is lowered.
2399 2018-07-06 22:22:32 Thanks Mark - great lesson - Slowly I'm getting a clearer vision how to trade this stocks
2400 2018-07-06 22:21:24 Ah mais je sais bien.

2402 2018-07-06 22:19:57 Here’s what Trump wants.
Say you die with a $100 million portfolio of highly appreciated stocks, with a cost basis of just $10 million. There would be no estate tax, and your heirs could sell the stock right after your death and owe no capital gains taxes on the $90 million gain.
2403 2018-07-06 22:18:22 Despite @elonmusk leaving & data scandals, #Facebook hit its high making Zuckerberg 3rd richest in the world, passing @WarrenBuffett. It seems dominate, so is it and other #FANG stocks just plain monopolies but we don't care.

2420 2018-07-06 22:02:08 At all five of the comic shops I visited today I asked about Alterna comics. To those who weren't familiar with Alterna I sang it's praises. My LCS owner already stocks Alterna titles and sells out every week!
2421 2018-07-06 22:02:05 I need start day trading these stocks. Portfolio up $100 today but I just leave it alone and lose that gain shortly hereafter. I mean it comes back but I can increase my position if I get more active
2422 2018-07-06 22:02:02 @tipsforstocks how would you rank these following stocks for growth in the next 1-3 years? Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Disney, Facebook, Alibaba, Microsoft.

2424 2018-07-06 22:00:26 One way to increase your comfort with risk is to familiarize yourself with the history of the market. Yes, stock prices can be volatile, but over the long term, stocks have outperformed all other asset classes. #investingbasics
2425 2018-07-06 22:00:09 My stocks went up today? Trade war? NOT — just buy American Made Products screw any import products! We have enough variety with everything in the USA see your cereal/ice cream isle as example .... just learn to purchase product differently or DON’T BITCH at the ^ price

You know how it's gunna end.

2432 2018-07-06 21:53:48 I would hope nobody has been 100% in cash in the last 9 years. Even a retiree should have some money in bonds or even stocks. Adding just 10-15% of stocks to a bond portfolio helps via diversification

2436 2018-07-06 21:50:17 @MTPDailyTweets need to tell these dumb pundits farmers hedge their crops way in advance.  They locked in their commodity prices a long time ago.  Farmers are not day trading their soybeans like stocks.

2442 2018-07-06 21:47:03 @yankees177 as far as Twitter I mainly use it to get updates on stocks and Tesla. My main passions in life have always been tech and cars ( so that explains a lot ). For many Tesla is a hobby. If you haven't driven one I'd really suggest a drive, yoy might become a fan too.
2443 2018-07-06 21:42:58 Try bread. Friends with a farmer who stocks up on days old (not moldy) bread from bakeries. Cows come running.
2444 2018-07-06 21:42:43 ss11-131
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
2445 2018-07-06 21:41:42 Why would one want to be doubly exposed to “international “ stocks in these times? Investing in domestic stocks already covers companies international exposure. Isn’t that the Bogle philosophy?
2446 2018-07-06 21:41:25 I detest people who make Trading (stocks or forex) seem easy, it’s not. You will not become a successful trader after attending a three day course or after attending a seminar presented by a “ so called Trading guru”, it’s like any other profession, it takes time/effort to master
2447 2018-07-06 21:41:15 What about the bidder that was popping up at the open? I was wondering why would they do that? On mid/high float stocks it’s usually when they know the stock will head lower, so I was wondering if this is simply evident manipulation?
2448 2018-07-06 21:40:41 Non-Farm Payrolls rise more than expected. U.S. Stocks rise. Kohl's to begin hiring seasonal holiday workers.
2449 2018-07-06 21:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2450 2018-07-06 21:38:31 I feel. I'm debating on getting a real job for a lil while. I keep blowing up small accounts on options, tryna switch to a big account for regular stocks
2451 2018-07-06 21:38:11 Clearly you know nothing about economics. The reason it continues to rise is because President Obama’s polices are still in effect for a year or so after he left. Trumps effect is just beginning now. That’s why gas went up. That’s why the stocks are down.
2452 2018-07-06 21:38:03 Well they did get bump stocks banned. Which is stupid in my opinion.
2453 2018-07-06 21:37:48 my stocks blew up today, bag comin in

2458 2018-07-06 21:35:03 The tax cuts that companies used to buy back stocks, increased the debit, and created a revenue hole that poor people will have to pay for? And in exchange for a $1000 we get government corruption and a racist president who steals children from parents. But cool, I guess.
2459 2018-07-06 21:34:32 James Bond tries to stop the Ese Trust, who is planning to use a solar powered laser to distribute stocks.
2460 2018-07-06 21:33:58 Leave my stocks up watch em go up, young investors
2461 2018-07-06 21:32:22 Tim is the only one who’s been clued in. To be fair they have to juggle a lot of stocks and sectors while many of us on here are (mostly) just $TSLA obsessed shorts hah.
2462 2018-07-06 21:32:19 I need to get more organized in my portfolio.  Before I found FI I was looking for get rich quick stuff.  I've got fundrise, LC, individual stocks through robinhood, wealthfront, and then I added VTSAX.
2463 2018-07-06 21:30:22 Idiot, the bump stocks and high cap magazines... yeah I get, but when you aren’t on your knees in front of the NRA, things do look fixable. “some time soon” comes when politicians like you get voted out of office, seen you in Nov.
2464 2018-07-06 21:27:09 Just like Trump using an unsecured cell phone for WH business; cuts to disabled veterans programs, and he wants to cut funding to children's health care programs.  He promised he would ban bump stocks, didn't; he promised he'd raise the age to 21 for gun ownership, didn't.  #SAD
2465 2018-07-06 21:24:45 I offered a bank to switch margin credit in fiat with xrp, with set xrp price to .3$ (my suggestion). They asked what is xrp, after i explained theyve said aha, you mean ripple. I said no, i mean xrp, i have no ripple stocks. 
They said we dont take that. I said ok, but you will.
2466 2018-07-06 21:24:34 Daily short-term price movements don't tell us anything. Stocks can be manipulated short-term. My arguments are for long-term outcomes, not short-term daily stock moves. This is what is confusing you. It was very unethical of you to post unsubstantiated BK rumors to impact price
2467 2018-07-06 21:23:53 I have stock in both companies and am losing$$$... Let's get it together!!!! @jimcramer #NYSE #stocks
2468 2018-07-06 21:22:58 Meanwhile, Trump and his elites are busy selling and buying #stocks

2470 2018-07-06 21:22:37 I use a watch list of those stocks from prior week with largest daily volumes and widest ATR.  Then shortlist to those with best setups on many timeframes.  Day trade only list.  Works very well.  
2471 2018-07-06 21:22:22 All thanks to riding Obama’s coattails. Under Trump we have ended the continual positive economic growth stretch. Stocks have had record losses. Unemployment is on the way up again.
2472 2018-07-06 21:21:40 Capital gain is the profit one earns on the sale of an asset like stocks, bonds or real estate.
2473 2018-07-06 21:18:51 All reports were if Trump was elected stocks would fall we'd end up in another recession, all presidents inherit the past Presidents economy/problems. Trump has kept it going and has accomplished more than any other since Reagan. It just seems the left can't/won't give credit.

2475 2018-07-06 21:16:39 Investors push stocks up on strong U.S. jobs data, look past trade tensions
2476 2018-07-06 21:16:02 World stocks higher: Us +.9%; Europe +.2%. Investors focused on solid employment data & strong US economy. Pretended rising  trade possibility wasn't there. Too soon to predict as it is all in hands of an unpredictable President. Expect lots of volatility until clearer.

2484 2018-07-06 21:07:37 $T I don’t think that the stock will necessarily go down ex-dividend. This is not always the case specially with undervalued stocks.

2486 2018-07-06 21:05:22 Stocks closed broadly higher Friday, snapping two consecutive weekly declines for the market.
2487 2018-07-06 21:04:54 Yes it's a crappy week to discern economic news BUT stocks ended today pretty ugly against what is supposed to be a strong jobs number. The reason: still lots of skepticism that trumps tax cuts and deregulation will trump the possibly dire economic impact of his trade war

The too big to fail banks are still strong and subject to tough stress testing. Bank stocks are down perhaps because of overregulation.

2509 2018-07-06 20:59:16 You're just parroting your hero at this point.  And you're about seven months late. Trump doesn't talk about the stock market anymore, his tariffs are tanking stocks and forcing American businesses overseas, you know, where most of trump's manufacturing plants are.

2530 2018-07-06 20:44:00 1/2 But you have no problem supporting trump? He and his inauguration committee has relieved millions from corporations. So have the rest of the GOP. So it's ok for them to get donations from corps and own stocks in pharma but no one else?
2531 2018-07-06 20:43:50 2/2 Btw, how do we know what he owns stocks in? Perhaps his tax information was available. Where's trump's? We could only imagine where he has his $$ invested.

2571 2018-07-06 20:19:42 Then your stocks were badly managed, because the bull market began its record gains in about 2010, and has slowed down substantially in 2018.

2573 2018-07-06 20:18:45 You cannot invest in @Ripple. There aren't any Ripple stocks. Though i agree with your message, please learn. You're contributing to mis-information.
2574 2018-07-06 20:18:02 Not tied to timeline so much as the event itself. That said, crashes tend to occur from higher heights or cliffs couple with complacency. We don't see that in stocks right now, quite the opposite. Let's see how the next few weeks and months develop.
2575 2018-07-06 20:18:01 Also capitalism has not failed me. I am able to work 40 hours a week and make and save money. With that money I can invest in stocks, I can put it in the bank and earn interest, and I can start a small business or buy real estate. Let me know if a socialist gov let’s you do that.

2580 2018-07-06 20:16:25 Stocks rally broadly on strong June jobs report but the gains are fairly modest.

Dow ends +94, +0.4% to 24,451, 
Nasdaq +1.3%, S&P +0.8%, Russell 2000 +0.9%

Last 5 days: Dow +0.7%, S&P +1.5%, Nasdaq +2.4%, Russell 2000 +3.1%. So the old leaders (tech + small stocks) lead again.
2581 2018-07-06 20:16:20 Should have my general trading page up this weekend on my site.  Trading resources for charting, etc. Should be helpful for learning about stocks... as well as cryptos!  They are different beasts but charting is a must in either space.

2591 2018-07-06 20:09:04 I think the mistake made from any of us, including @davidein in regards to the bubble stocks, has been the unrelenting determination of central banks to, on a worldwide basis, hold short term real  yields firmly in negative territory.

I'm trying to figure out how to best protect myself sadly. I'm considering having my 401(k) buy some land - right now it's all stocks/bonds. That way I'd at least have a place to pop a tent lol. Ugh.

2600 2018-07-06 20:03:46 We do not believe the current implementation of tariffs will be the catalyst for a systemic move to the downside, we believe tariffs will be removed should they become politically/economically inconvenient.

2601 2018-07-06 20:03:37 Of course you are right, however "some" of that money will go to smallcap stocks on shore!
2602 2018-07-06 20:03:25 Also lobbyists and industry execs directly opposed to the missions of the organizations they run. Which I’m sure has nothing to do with insider knowledge of reg repeals or using that info for personal/friendly gain. That’s totally not why Icahn sold his steel stocks b4 tariffs.

2619 2018-07-06 19:55:20 Before I started #crypto, I invested in stocks, primarily tech stocks that had promising futures. 

I remember when $SQ was $10 and $NVDA was $32. Little did I know those were both influential to $BTC and mining.
2620 2018-07-06 19:54:56 I see, so the “invasion” rhetoric is a facade to keep his base tingly but really Trump is for open borders so his buddies who gave him campaign contributions can make millions on private prisons. Because I do remember when he was elected and private prison stocks skyrocketed.

Chinese IPO stocks are being hurt by trade war rhetoric, and commodities are too. Trevali now trading at 3x forward. That's even more insane than $ROXG.TO (which is ALSO insane).

2625 2018-07-06 19:49:25 My personal view is that having a long time horizon rather than trying to trade is a much better place to start if you want to ‘invest’. Stocks like $HYNS.L had loads of freehold assets & big divi to provide comfort whilst researching. Short time price movement can wash over.

2670 2018-07-06 19:21:57 In other news, major media outlets prove that their financial experts have no actual clue what drives stock market prices.

2687 2018-07-06 19:13:04 Biggest companies are the ones doing the most buybacks. So overall "index" like Nasdaq or S&P 500, which is weighted index by market cap, goes higher if the biggest stocks go higher (Apple, Facebook, etc.)

2718 2018-07-06 19:00:35 You still haven't figured out that stocks go up when people aren't buying, and go down when they do buy? Wall Street secrets

2721 2018-07-06 18:58:43 The health care industry depends on the Democrats cause they know with the poor they get rich 70% of all  healthcare lobbyists donations go 2 the democratic party.ever wonder why.

2727 2018-07-06 18:56:33 #Micron $MU and other US tech companies should be prepared for more tariff related attacks. Owning stocks which are less susceptible to tariffs makes more sense going forward. Time to find stocks which are immune to Trump, such makers of long red ties, fox news, and golf

2795 2018-07-06 18:16:49 One doubt, when filtering stocks out looking for long term trends (months to years), do you know if it's better to check the momentum on 3m, or 6m or 12m of price performance? I get quite different results depending on the filtering and I've not managed to clarify that just yet

2837 2018-07-06 17:56:33 why do you say stocks are overvalued?  Especially because it is impossible for us to really know things for certain due to all of the "unknowns"

2962 2018-07-06 16:47:35 I don't like the Chinese stocks and only own Tencent in my own portfolio. There's no way to know what's really going on in the business or financials. Additionally, they are the "winner" companies (chosen by the government.) No way to know if they can compete outside of China.
2963 2018-07-06 16:47:11 Academic teaches diversification. In practice I’ve done much better holding a handful of stocks especially growth names.
2964 2018-07-06 16:46:59 What happened to “let’s bomb the shit out of Isis?” Only relevant when Trump says it? Doubling the debt wasn’t great, but necessary to save the economy. We gained 11.6m jobs, & the unemployment rate dropped below historical norm. Corporate profit & stocks also increased 166%.
2965 2018-07-06 16:46:09 Stocks adding to gains. Mortgage Bond prices off highs.
2966 2018-07-06 16:45:56 Stocks near unchanged soon after the opening bell.

2970 2018-07-06 16:44:54 Plus both those stocks are in a down trend and IQ had some more bad news this morning and huya follows it
2971 2018-07-06 16:43:29 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2972 2018-07-06 16:43:21 @ShaquilleONeal9 I do invest in high risk options but success requires
strong moves in underlying stocks. One can take the more conservative 
route with the stock. Let me present my "fundamental view" approach to you and any others interested. I'm for real. Just want to give back

2974 2018-07-06 16:43:05 why are stocks going up? 

because people are buying

why are they buying?

because stocks are going up
2975 2018-07-06 16:42:37 I don’t get it if people want to be diversified there’s no better way than to own an index fund. For “enterprising” investors you need 15-20 stocks. People uncomfortable with volatility shouldn’t own stocks or reduce volatility of their net worth through holding cash
2976 2018-07-06 16:42:28 Unemployment Rate for workers with a bachelor degree or higher 2.3%, vs 2.0% in May, another reason why wages didn’t increase as much as expected in June

3005 2018-07-06 16:31:48 Consob is a stock authority in Italy, something like SEC in USA.

This huge spike in Juve's stocks in such a small span of time is not normal and it happened due to media spotlight. So Juve gave clarity to address the topic upon Consob's request.

Nothing to worry about.

3010 2018-07-06 16:30:24 only stocks pushing the mkts up are the FANGS again and again. If a few big firms like Goldman come out and finally downgrade the growth stocks, the markets will fall big. These stocks say economy is perfect, while rates say no.
3011 2018-07-06 16:29:17 That might be negative for stocks later right? 4% is still considered full employment though. What do you think is happening?
3012 2018-07-06 16:28:42 Only thing I would point out is the $2-plus sell-off in cash soybeans is a reflection of old-crop s&d rather than "assuming a normal crop", which I assumed to be new-crop. I still think there is a good chance that this year could see a contra-seasonal increase in USDA Q4 stocks.

3095 2018-07-06 16:00:25 On Monday, With Sun trine Neptune and Moon in nakshtra of Sun, I am bullish on 2 Stocks.

3097 2018-07-06 15:58:58 @FuzzyPandaShort picks vulnerable stocks to write botch job articles capitalizing on non-sophisticated investor bases. Anyone with a brain can read between the lines.
3098 2018-07-06 15:58:40 Let’s go. Reverse. Reverse.
3099 2018-07-06 15:57:23 I disagree, most of the promotors buy to trap gullible investors and then sell them at even higher prices and then rinse & repeat. If they are so interested in low prices of their stocks why not buy in huge quantities wrt their net worth ?

3102 2018-07-06 15:56:01 $SPY My hardest job today is sitting, watching my stocks go higher. OK, it's not that hard  :) lol
3103 2018-07-06 15:55:43 I like the lack of discrimination in those portfolios. Don’t just buy the good stocks, but own some bad ones too. And not just the big ones but the small ones. It’s more fair that way.

3114 2018-07-06 15:51:40 Hindsight talking? I never said it's going to recover fast now. I said it recovers much faster than any other assets in the world. The price you pay = huge volatility. But according to the graphs, it's a very good SoV, especially when stocks are entering the bear market now.

3205 2018-07-06 15:11:51 @NPR Just caught a news bump where you cheerily spun the rising unemployment number to favor trump, then fluffed Scott Pruitt by focusing on the friends he’s made in industry, then just closed with “stocks are up!” ..as if it’s just a great day in America. You’ve lost your way.
3206 2018-07-06 15:11:09 Wages are down; growth is at 2.3%, rather than 3%, as Trump claimed; the tax plan incentivized companies to buy up stocks, not benefit employees; regulatory rollbacks threaten stability; the tariffs are a disaster. Cite something reputable, not FOX.

3302 2018-07-06 14:25:54 That Chopra comment is idiotic. I track a lot of penny stocks for which a 1 cent up-tick from the bid to the ask qualifies as a 10% gain.  #ROFLMAO

3320 2018-07-06 14:18:33 Selling off stocks is just a part of the #GeneralStrike. We only need some people with stocks to sell off their stocks. We don't need to send Trump a message. We only need to send GOP donors a message...
3321 2018-07-06 14:18:17 The logic is appealing.  Just buying random stocks is probably a money loser over time right?  OK, then the opposite is...

3323 2018-07-06 14:16:26 But it's not the best economy. It's the best stock market in 60 years. The stock market is just an indication of how the rich are doing given that almost 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10%.
3324 2018-07-06 14:16:13 Workers why don't you want more immigrants, if we get more immigrants there will be more workers so your company can pay (you) less for labor and save money and stocks will go up?

3326 2018-07-06 14:15:16 "Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who've been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage."
- Peter Lynch
3327 2018-07-06 14:14:35 Usually I like #generalstrike but this one has flawed assumptions. Most people who oppose Trump don't own stocks. People who own stocks usually support Trump. Trump is not going to step down because we send him a message. We need a strike with real effects and complete shut down.
3328 2018-07-06 14:14:06 Alot of stock bouncing at the US open today even after the US/China (& Russian) tariff announcement. Suggests to me that it was already factored into the price of many stocks and I think we should continue to bounce into next week.

3333 2018-07-06 14:12:16 True, but it's also true for investments in other cryptos and in stocks. You put an evaluation to something and it's very hard to objectively translate "what is there" to a certain $ value. The speculative value of $DIG in comparison to it's price is why we are here imo haha.
3334 2018-07-06 14:11:29 A “high yield” savings account - at best! - treads water vis a vis inflation. Best long term passive strategy is to dollar cost average into index funds. Or even a diversified portfolio of blue-chip dividend stocks. Market prices already reflect the “critical thinking” consensus.

3365 2018-07-06 13:58:21 Yes but if you wait for the recession the value of your stocks and bonds will crash. Sell while value is high and buy when there’s blood on the streets. Same thing applies before events with political uncertainty eg 2019 elections. Free advice: follow foreign investors

3367 2018-07-06 13:58:08 I wonder the wisdom of listening to people talk about investing who have never made any money investing. Academics has a place. But the stock market is not academics. It’s the stock market.  The scoreboard is money. Not holding crap value stocks in a growth market.

3501 2018-07-06 12:47:20 Trump’s tax cuts provided a stimulus, tilting towards the wealthy & corporations, savings from tax cuts allowed companies in the S&P 500 to buy back a record number of stocks in the first quarter of 2018, yet have done little to generate substantial wage increases. #GOPTaxScam

3518 2018-07-06 12:42:15 Us payrolls actually quite positive for risk: US still producing a decent number of jobs each month, but wages tempered, so no extra rate hike surprises from the Fed. Hence US futures turned higher before the open. #NFP #Us #Economy #Stocks #Trading #Whattradewars !

3524 2018-07-06 12:40:25 Not remotely meaningless.  New money doesn't get spread evenly throughout the economy instantly.  This is why monetary inflation doesn't instantly raise CPI. It does however pump up stocks and asset prices which are typically held by more wealthy people.

This will happen just as stocks top and then everything sells off. Look and analysis pre 2008 crash. Metals rallied hard before the crash.
3609 2018-07-06 11:32:47 S&P 500 might reach close to  1800 within the next 12 months . Triggers would be @realDonaldTrump #tariffs #TradeWar #BrexitBritain . China likely to dump us trys , as a last case assault . #stocks #NovemberIsComing and world markets might likewise also crash.#Nifty

3617 2018-07-06 11:28:56 Remember after the Parkland shootings, @realDonaldTrump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

Neither has happened. 

The NRA controls Trump. 

TRUMP IS A WEAK, COWARDLY, OLD MAN.
3618 2018-07-06 11:27:35 and finally there are delays in the supply chain. Currently EU trucks go through ports in around 2 minutes. Non-EU trucks, 20 minutes, at best, often longer.  That destroys JIT supply systems meaning manufacturers have to build warehouses and purchase additional safety stocks (3)

So they got shares at .50 nothing we can do about that

lets see if they keep them or sell them. The later would send a bad signal. Keeping may say they feel the SP will rise much higher

3656 2018-07-06 10:58:36 To be fair, they did say “battlefield machine guns”.  AR-15s are neither used on the battlefield, nor are they machine guns (full-auto).  Bump stocks do not convert them to full-auto either.  And for the record, I don’t buy that people are trying to take guns away either.

Getting caught - yes. Getting punished doesn't matter.

If robbers could do a great risk-evaluation, they'd trade stocks, not gov banks.

You can't hedge against getting caught, anyway.

3863 2018-07-06 07:41:24 One reason is that we have lots of capital ( eg: Inflows in mutual funds ) but not many cutting edge technology companies or companies with powerful  brands . Money gets pushed to same old blue chip stocks (& some crap ).

Of doctrinal emancipations where the ultimatum has sighed--

A poem should be indomitable
As the projection of earningss.

You meant to say "I really insist on having >STOPS< on every single position at all times", not stocks. Also, what kind of turnaround deadline do you need with your book proofreading?
4017 2018-07-06 05:36:05 I own stocks with a ten to twenty year outlook. I keep track of the companies I own. I’ll sell only rarely. That is a self imposed discipline. The default option is buy and hold. Though I don’t rule out selling, I want that to be as infrequent as possible.

4113 2018-07-06 04:32:19 I hate all of these unnecessary terms in stocks; to be honest I think it's just trying to make finances unnecessarily complicated for the masses
4114 2018-07-06 04:32:05 Lots of stuff that appears in Media is planted by vested interest. These vested interests also include brokerage houses that print reports giving targets for stocks

4123 2018-07-06 04:25:43 Peggy, What Trump says is well beyond exaggerating, much of what he says is prosecutable criminally & libelous. It’s unimaginable that he isn’t involved in more lawsuits.  He’s tanked a number of company’s stocks, like Amazon’s twice, with false statements; that’s criminal.

4134 2018-07-06 04:17:01 One of the mistakes that investors make in early part of their journey is that they chase price of a stock. I did many a times and have learnt for better that you need to track a few business and then wait for the right price to enter. #Investments #stocks

4232 2018-07-06 03:14:12 Many #cryllionaire's recycle, upcycle and repurpose; eg. shop for clothes or household goods at op shops, and invest the money you saved into crypto, stocks, ETF's or property. Compost household waste & grow small veges. Use eBay to buy & sell :) Happy to chat :)
4233 2018-07-06 03:11:51 The analysis of volume you’ve been taught for trading #stocks, #Forex, and #futures is generally designed for trading daily charts, so when learning how to use volume in day trading, you must use a little different technique.
4234 2018-07-06 03:07:52 G'day Claudia :) Some #cryllionaire's are quite frugal; eg. shop at op shops to buy $300 outfit for $5 and invest the saved money into appreciating assets, eg. crypto, stocks, property, ETF's etc. Some of us drive an old car yet have new investments :)

4261 2018-07-06 02:46:13 “Know the difference between potential profit and potential FOR profit.”

We sometimes focus so much on how MUCH we can make, we lose focus on the likelihood of actually achieving that profit.

4263 2018-07-06 02:45:46 Very true.!!
We should not compare a high quality with a low quality in terms of their price, value or performance. Good quality stocks will be always costly, irrespective of the market conditions.

4264 2018-07-06 02:45:03 Teddy Roosevelt called to say Trump has the wrong idea. Doesn't it make more sense to conserve what we have rather than exploit it for next quarter's profit numbers? Scars from commercial fishing on the sea bottom and reduced stocks can be devastating and permanent.
4265 2018-07-06 02:41:47 On a lot of spec stocks these day about half the traded volume sometimes more is going through the ChiX rather than ASX platform

A lot of retail brokers still don’t show ChiX orders or volume throug their platforms and more problematic is that a lot of charts don’t either

Why?

4268 2018-07-06 02:37:29 Because I prefer more volatile stocks.  This moves too slow for me.  Not a fan of a 20 cent move that takes too long to materialize.

4348 2018-07-06 01:48:31 Yes, the stocks meets my SEPA criteria; I bought it today. Now it's just a matter of letting the stock prove the trade right or wrong. If it moves against me, my stop will limit my loss. Pretty straight forward.
4349 2018-07-06 01:47:58 Your definition of stocks is incomplete.  A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Stocks represent a claim on the company's assets and earnings.  So the taxes payed did not include the increased value in assets.  Checkmate.

4372 2018-07-06 01:28:59 There's a thing called paper trading. It's trading stocks with fake money in a simulation of the real stock market live. It's a good way to learn how to day or swing trade and practice without losing actual money.

4383 2018-07-06 01:18:10 Any ideas about how it could be done? For example, I know one fund manager that created a fund with 10 best idea stocks and a 10-year lock up. Stocks could be sold (and the capital returned to investors) but not bought. It did really well. 
4384 2018-07-06 01:17:59 Agreed. Any impact on yield will be met with intensification and require more resources/ increase pollution etc. If you're talking about spread of disease to wild stocks, lots of reports on this for salmonids, most saying better monitoring of wild stocks needed to assess.

4403 2018-07-06 00:56:39 @SenSanders  all you need to read is one book on economics. “Stocks for the Long Run” by Wharton school of Business Renown  economist Dr. JeremySiegel.  Learn about the economy and how the average person can thrive in a free country.  #economics
4404 2018-07-06 00:53:52 It was a good move, I am taking time off, as I survey the trade issue. Right now, it looks like all the damage is piling up on Asian Markets and Asian stocks, but there will be a point when this is not the outcome.
