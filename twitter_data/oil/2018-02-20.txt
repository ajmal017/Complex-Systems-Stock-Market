45 2018-02-20 23:56:36 How reliable are renewables?Although renewables are a step in the right direction, you've got to give your head a shake & do some research here. We live in Canada-not California. We are transitioning to clean energy, but it all comes down to supply & demand. Consumers demand oil.

85 2018-02-20 23:50:50 It's the same when people say 'Kill big oil' or 'Kill tobacco'. We all understand that these are industries and not people. Your being hyperbolic and frankly making yourself look stupid.

87 2018-02-20 23:50:28 Coal is good. Cheap, easily available, abundant deposits, good CO2 which is plant food, etc. Wind is ok if it costs the same or cheaper than other energy sources - as should be the case for solar, gas, oil and the rest. Opposing something on the basis purely of ideology is silly.
88 2018-02-20 23:50:08 RT @AcneSkinSite: It's vital even oily skin gets moisture because, without it, the skin will overcompensate for the loss of hydration (with more oil), leading to breakouts and an uneven skin texture. Take note: Moisturizing adds water to the skin, not oil.

117 2018-02-20 23:44:45 I'm not proposing restrictions on oil production.

150 2018-02-20 23:39:39 Info I found in google, conventional oil needs changing every 3k to 5k miles. Synthetic every 7k to 10k. And if you switch to synthetic, don't go back to conventional.
151 2018-02-20 23:39:27 What about oil and gas, aviation section bro, will be glad help me out in this...God bless you, will be waiting...
152 2018-02-20 23:39:27 As far as your vag goes just have quan use some face clippers down there....its the only way your gonna get it done. Just tell him to pull the skin right when he goes across it or it can still knick you, and use baby oil. It helps
153 2018-02-20 23:39:23 you’ll love it! Add a little tea tree oil, vitamin e oil and apple cider vinegar
154 2018-02-20 23:39:18 Following you back! Lol
155 2018-02-20 23:39:08 I cleaned and vacuumed my car out, changed my taillight and checked my oil. If I wasn't afraid of fucking some shit up I woulda changed my headlight too 
156 2018-02-20 23:38:42 I’m getting my car’s oil changed. I don’t know anything about cars so for every service they offer I’m thinking (I don’t know what that is), and I say “Sure, I should get that.”

160 2018-02-20 23:38:09 The feel of olive oil falling on the ear drum. Special
161 2018-02-20 23:38:03 I know it’s a love it/hate it thing but Marmite! Or I have just gotten into smashed avocado - I mash up one ripe avocado with the juice of half a lime, a pinch of salt and chilli flakes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a little squeeze of garlic paste - it’s so good! xx
162 2018-02-20 23:37:58 He & Henry Ford worked on a non petroleum based fuel, can’t imagine why standard oil didn’t let that come about.
163 2018-02-20 23:37:58 Have you or have you ever considered taking CBD oil?
164 2018-02-20 23:37:38 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
165 2018-02-20 23:37:14 Alberta Government, before you impose more climate damage on BC please clean up the tailings ponds and the abandoned oil wells.

174 2018-02-20 23:35:45 Look. Any country that simply hands a major industry (oil/gas) over to its rich neighbour by donating its resource is just plain stupid. QED

176 2018-02-20 23:35:25 Does anyone in Maynooth know what the creepy noise at night is? It's been going on for a few days and sounds like a someone needs to oil their giant metal gate
177 2018-02-20 23:35:25 Yeah, the car manual will have the info you need dealing with oil. Synthetic is best for high mileage vehicles. 60k miles isn't bad and wouldn't hurt to switch to synthetic.
178 2018-02-20 23:35:24 Why would I change my own oil when parts cost $35 when I can go to tiresplus for $25. Someone explain. I understand that it’s better oil, but is that the only thing?
179 2018-02-20 23:35:20 Same I unfollowed them too, I don’t feel they are reliable

183 2018-02-20 23:34:48 I've always loved #Fossils. From my earliest memories I've been fascinated by them. Bought my first #Trilobite when I was a child. Wish I hadn't lost it many years later. I've always loved #FossilFuels, too! From as long as I can remember. Pumped my first gas as a kid. #Oil #Gas

188 2018-02-20 23:34:11 Russia is hardly a 3rd World nothing. They have a reconstituted military that is close to/at Soviet era strength with a commitment to continue to grow. They have large oil reserves that they could cut off all of Eastern Europe
189 2018-02-20 23:34:06 LOL Gabe Kapler is a snake oil salesman. 59-101.
190 2018-02-20 23:34:01 Car Insurance Company: We can give you a lower price by sending us your emission report and number of oil checkups.
Me: The car is electric. There’s no emissions or oil changes.
CIC: But where do you put the oil? Don’t you smog check it?
Me: 
191 2018-02-20 23:33:08 Tonight, we’re rooting for the Fancy Cats and Oil Rigs, in addition to #GoBolts.

193 2018-02-20 23:33:00 What are your favorite uses for coconut oil??
194 2018-02-20 23:32:36 keep forgetting to buy castor oil for my brows bc my mom BROKE my other bottle
195 2018-02-20 23:32:25 If you've got money in oil stocks, then you're making money off oil companies. Stein's taken meetings with Russia, pushed an America First platform of ignoring what other countries do, and has supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine, all good for its oil expansion.
196 2018-02-20 23:32:15 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Don't look now but the oil companies are quietly stealing the disposable income you gave ball to us in the new tax bill. Prices at the pump are rising dramatically and hitting all of us in the wallet.
197 2018-02-20 23:32:07 Drop in the bucket. Dirty Russian oil $$$ totals $40M x *$25,000* -- and that's just oil money! These monies trickle down to the Rep level in Congress, where seemingly innocuous votes can be bought for a cool $mil or two. THIS GOES WAY DEEP.
198 2018-02-20 23:32:07 The way I do it is after I put the tea tree oil I’ll do one sheet mask, sometimes two depending on how dry my face is, cuz I have really dry skin
199 2018-02-20 23:32:04 Somebody, please RICO this bitch.
200 2018-02-20 23:32:04 Vegetable oil. Dripping is alright in powerful commercial fryers or chip pans, but knackers cheap domestic fryers.

Over years of neglect had lead to so much problems,  today China is influencing Srilanka , Maldives and Nepal  & they are in China's control.  We need to burn the midnight oil to change this situation.

A little setback, but certainly not game over for UKOG - 150 days of production and flow testing at HH is some plan B you have to admit...

208 2018-02-20 23:31:09 But Russians can swing an election by sprinkling a few hundred $ here and there?

211 2018-02-20 23:30:50 #OOTT | Market bulls are hopeful that narrowing price premium of Brent over WTI crude will last, which in turn could reduce U.S. supplies coming into Europe and Asia. cc. @InterfaxEnergy #WTI #Brent #Oil
212 2018-02-20 23:30:49 Venezuela offered a new crypto backed by Oil. That is like Oil backed by worthless dollars. Not a good understanding of the double spend. When you sell the Oil you deplete the Oil value. No exchange for value in the equation just diminishing returns.
213 2018-02-20 23:30:44 Genuinely just clicked on a video about an oil diffuser to see if I could smell it 
214 2018-02-20 23:30:41 Today is NOT our day  I just checked mine and it’s just a cracked oil pan so not too bad but still shitty.
215 2018-02-20 23:30:27 Kakaa oil
216 2018-02-20 23:30:15 Yes!!!!! I used vitamin E oil 25/8!!

219 2018-02-20 23:30:01 today i choked on rosemary and olive oil triscuits
220 2018-02-20 23:30:01 Oil prices are low because of a glut of cheap oil from the Saudi/OPEC nations.  Cheap oil=cheap gas! The 1st thing #Cult45 will bitch about when the price of oil rises is the cost of gas. O&G production isn’t a no brainer for those lacking the proper gray matter.
221 2018-02-20 23:29:49 Also President Trump has ended the ban on drilling and pipe lines.  The price of oil and gas is lower and this will crush Putin in the near future.
222 2018-02-20 23:29:42 I'm not bagging on the trade.  But it was Larsson at a high (because of short supply) and Hall at a low (because of perceived Oil urgency and warts magnified under those conditions).
223 2018-02-20 23:29:27 I swear on anything @OtterBox has gotta be the best protective phone case brand in the business. Literally just slammed my hood shut on my phone cuz I forgot to move it since I used it as a flashlight to check my oil. 3 slams later and not even a cracked screen. #blessed

227 2018-02-20 23:28:45 NOT snake, I assure you, haha. I had pecans and coconut, pan roasted with a little olive oil, palm sugar, and maple syrup. I just ruined my dinner. 
228 2018-02-20 23:28:27 We knew this would happen weeks ago, they will just continue to wait for the initial furor to die down then release everyone involved every time this happens. It's their roundabout method of removing monuments they can't legally remove.

234 2018-02-20 23:27:39 I’m so garbage at oil painting
235 2018-02-20 23:27:34 I was buying mineral oil in 10 litre drums (it is very expensive). Part of the problem with owning a Roller is that no one knows how to fix them, and every one charges mega-bucks for trying. Don't doubt 'your mate' made millions in the process. Hope I did not contribute!
236 2018-02-20 23:27:30 I'm not super familiar with Stein's policies (didn't feel the need to look further than the woo) so I don't really see the connection with the articles you've shared.

Orthogonally, would you consider me (who has a small amount of money in the S&P) to be taking big oil money?
237 2018-02-20 23:27:28 Oh wow! Try an oil (coconut, olive oil) or rubbing alcohol
238 2018-02-20 23:27:24 Westminster operates a creative accounting practice on Scots Taxation , from oil to export reclassification. Approximately the same as the psuedo deficit.

241 2018-02-20 23:26:54 You are the one being deceived by Trump and his snake oil. Trump is a con man and you’re his favorite type of mark.

251 2018-02-20 23:24:42 Oil? The Roller does not have a conventional suspension, but 'floats' on a bed of mineral oil in reservoirs with little pistons acting between the road and the cabin. One dickhead service-person (there were many) drove a screw through one of the reservoirs (they are linked) and
252 2018-02-20 23:24:41 Antony followed me till I blocked him.
253 2018-02-20 23:24:33 We also import a lot of things not including oil where a devalued dollar has less purchasing power. Market is getting spastic for a reason.

257 2018-02-20 23:24:06 Thank you, good to see that we still have politicians in parliament that have not been bought by oil money. It's sickening that @BorisJohnson supports Turkish/jihadist bombardment of the Kurds.

259 2018-02-20 23:23:58 Scotiabank Chief Economist on CTV PP gave very grim portrait of oil losses and unruly expenses resulting in crippled Canadian industry, and lost investment. Even Keystone, if ever, hands profit margin to USA. Don't kid selves, this affects every aspect of Canadian economics.
260 2018-02-20 23:23:30 someone teach me how to change my oil so places can stop trying to charge me $80
261 2018-02-20 23:22:55 Roast them with other veg (vine toms especially!!) with balsamic vinegar and chilli oil, season with garlic and salt and pep and serve with rice or quinoa salad!!

279 2018-02-20 23:20:22 Oil dropped to the supply of it. More wells means lower prices. Rockefeller understood this.
280 2018-02-20 23:20:21 Well, 
1. We're perfectionists, especially me (very annoying)
2. there is a risk of nasty anaerobic bacteria growing in water in oil. For example when people flavor oils with herbs, they must be careful the herbs have no water in them.

298 2018-02-20 23:17:52 Started an art series of oil pastel on canvas in patterns trying to depict my current perspective on life in colours and patterns. I'll be posting pics on Insta of the finished products- keep your eyes peeled and check them out

315 2018-02-20 23:15:31 If Mar A Lago were on a fault, we would have had it last January 21st. That's why drilling for oil off the coast of Florida was banned, leaving the rest of the coastal states vulnerable.
316 2018-02-20 23:15:25 So, the SNP will be to blame when the oil industry in Aberdeen picks up again? Say, in the last couple of months and the rest of 2018?
317 2018-02-20 23:15:10 Is pear "au feu d'enfer" an omega 3 fish oil?
318 2018-02-20 23:15:02 Is it just me who hates the whole olive oil + balsamic dip combo? Always seems a waste of good produce
319 2018-02-20 23:14:56 Yup. One of my colleagues did her PhD work on the Laysan Albatross. She got a shout-out from @StephenAtHome for her "albatresbian” discovery. I got bit, covered in shit, and never did get the squid oil smell out of that shirt. I think she got the better part of the deal. ;)

322 2018-02-20 23:14:32 Just think, the profits would soar and the kids would be safer! That is the voice of a snake oil salesman. I don't get the impression these students would support such a hideous idea.
323 2018-02-20 23:14:20 We swear by ostrich oil.  Ostrich oil is high in Omega 3, 6 and 9 which prevent stretch marks and help fade the ones already there. Smooth, soft and healthy skin!
324 2018-02-20 23:14:19 Was going to pipe up to recommend this. I use ylang ylang and lime oil. Smells so good. To be honest sometimes I just use the coconut oil and essential oil alone and it still works.
325 2018-02-20 23:13:56 Julie seems reasonable.

329 2018-02-20 23:13:43 Why isn’t ryan changing your oil
330 2018-02-20 23:13:36 Everyone does - except the Republican's who have taken the oil money.  They need a super SUPER majority to raise taxes (75%) they just had a vote and it failed.  There is no plan B.

Im all in for crypto and Im not telling who should use or not. Like scams we should just not support it
337 2018-02-20 23:13:12 Is it bad to just mix a bunch of oils in a oil defuser

Me: goes to the bathroom hits oil pen.
363 2018-02-20 23:10:16 And if we're talking about reducing GHG emissions- then shouldn't we be transporting our oil vis pipelines and NOT by rail?! I mean rail is FARRRRR more dangerous 4x more dangerous. #DYK pipelines produce 61-77% fewer GHG emissions than rail?

365 2018-02-20 23:10:12 First dates with me include:

- Me asking what essential oil is your favorite
- Asking to watch snatch game after I’ve already pulled it up on YouTube

368 2018-02-20 23:09:49 dejen de importar galletas, entreguen harina de trigo en el clap y que en su casa la gente haga galletas. Es inverosímil que cueste Bs. 400.000  un paquete de galletas. Y no se pueden hacer tortas en casa? Pero los panaderos todavia hacen lo que les da la gana @DenunciasSundde
369 2018-02-20 23:09:41 Did you talk with the Scotiabank about Canada losing 10.7 Billion from our economy as we strangle our oil production with pipeline constraints. Where are you going to find the monies as your policies bankrupt us?
370 2018-02-20 23:09:25 @Oil_Foundation if you could contact me at my email at chrismonteith50@gmail.com I submitted a request online but I can only do 6 weeks from now she might not have 6 weeks.
371 2018-02-20 23:09:17 We swear by ostrich oil. Plant-based lotions don't penetrate the same way animal based oils do. Ostrich oil is high in Omega 3, 6 and 9 which prevent stretch marks and help fade the ones already there. Smooth, soft and healthy skin!
372 2018-02-20 23:09:10 It should be in dollars instead of this cheap performance , Nigeria produces 2.3 million barrels per day with a benchmark of $53 per barrel which equals $121.9 million daily . That’s for oil alone. What about taxes, import duties , school fees ? It’s a shame

378 2018-02-20 23:07:49 Why do earlier immigrants get land absolutely and forever? They only got here earlier that anyone else. They didn’t know about oil, gold, electricity, etc. They killed each other for territory; so where is their payment to previous peoples?
379 2018-02-20 23:07:48 What are they going to do about the power grid and loss of gas tax for roads? Frankly I seriously doubt this happens. More open pit mines will upset the Green nuts more than oil.

386 2018-02-20 23:06:25 Oh dear, Midget keyboard warrior here, some facts for you, indyref assumed oil price at $100p/b today $62p/b, big improvement on the $43p/b in June 17, Scotland’s finances then don’t work. Scot GDP is approx £158b England’s GDP £1.5trillion, population eng 54m sco 5.3m

390 2018-02-20 23:06:17 Try ostrich oil! It penetrates deeply and is high in Omega 3, 6, and 9. ALL which prevent stretch marks and help minimize the ones you do have!
391 2018-02-20 23:06:11 Their a fucking hater and it was made for dry skin that’s why you’re suppose to use hydration oil before applying

406 2018-02-20 23:03:40 If women use oil paint or car paint for makeup, won't it last longer? It's just a suggestion, I don't have experience in these matters.
407 2018-02-20 23:03:22 Two thumbs up!
408 2018-02-20 23:03:12 It's clearly warmongering, isn't it?  Nobody looks at the phrase "peak trans" and thinks - oh, yeah - just like peak oil.  I'd never heard of "peak oil" until 30 seconds ago!
409 2018-02-20 23:03:02 I gather palm oil is only 49% saturated. Mainly palmitic acid c18. It’s 20% omega 6 linoleic acid. when fresh it is red due to high carotenoid content. These prevent oxidation, rancidification. By the time it gets to your plate, it’s RBD refined bleached deodorised. Stick to ghee

416 2018-02-20 23:02:12 Instead of Emu oil, you should try Ostrich Oil! Ostrich oil is very similar to emu, but it has more Omega 3, 6 and 9s. Plus it has smaller molecules which means it penetrates deeper.
417 2018-02-20 23:02:02 Still to see a chart, on the diversity, with regards to inclusion of first nation people. How many Australian Energy companies have aboriginals as CEO's? How many US oil and gas companies have native americans in leadership positions? Much worse ratio, and a lot less talked about
418 2018-02-20 23:01:58 That's not on them, that's on the organization. When it came to publicly dealing w/ sh*t, he was the one who continually sat and took it...unlike others.
419 2018-02-20 23:01:38 I could go into specifics but you probably know C60 is greasy. How can microscopic 'clumps' dissolve?
If we were to sell pulverized c60, it would be in a few ml of ethanol (normal alcohol). Having said that, the ethanol would evap out of oil pretty quickly.

441 2018-02-20 22:59:33 To be honest Jeremy, I think it's save to say the entire Fereence experiment blew up in this organization's face...from all directions. Nothing worse than having a captain who was incapable of contributing on the ice but sure liked to talk to the media and preach the gospel.
442 2018-02-20 22:59:33 Oil changed, new air filter & ordered the parts for my shifter, I’m a happy girl 
443 2018-02-20 22:59:18 Is there a link to the quotes in question?

445 2018-02-20 22:58:33 This evenings essential oil class is cancelled. Sorry for the inconvenience. We will see you at the next one on tuesday March 6th.
446 2018-02-20 22:58:21 When I’m in town tomorrow I’m going to buy A4 battery’s, extension leads,COD liver oil tablets and socks.
447 2018-02-20 22:58:19 Care to reword this and tweet again? 
Machine gun madness???????
448 2018-02-20 22:58:11 Wait till you discover Ostrich Oil. It is one case where bigger is definitely better!
449 2018-02-20 22:58:00 From the Mumsnet thread you clearly lurk on: 'It does not surprise me that transgender advocates claim that peak oil is not the point where extraction exceeds capacity but rather it is akin to women trying to diminish MRAs like Madigan to nothing.' 
450 2018-02-20 22:57:59 Lobster eating....extra omega oil, makes him "brainer"....?
451 2018-02-20 22:57:58 I thought you were allowed cbd oil as long as there was no thc in it. Or is this not suitable?
452 2018-02-20 22:57:54 I sometimes quote your advice of pumping the oil you hit, not what you drill for. I vaguely recall you saying that this was originally his line??
453 2018-02-20 22:57:42 You already did, you were great neighbors with ISIS, why no big war with them right away?  Enjoyed the cheap stolen oil?  #syria
454 2018-02-20 22:57:33 Jet power! That's what I'm talking about
#DragRace #NHRA #JETCARS #ThatsHowItsDone
455 2018-02-20 22:57:32 Has anyone used magnesium oil?
456 2018-02-20 22:57:29 Hi Delmy! For mostly dry skin, we recommend our Witch hazel herbal extract toner, but if your skin is more combination and prone to oil, we suggest our Bergamot herbal extract toner!
457 2018-02-20 22:57:23 Took accountability? By the comments of some of his former teammates, the kids didn't take or get held accountable nearly enough.
458 2018-02-20 22:57:18 @claytonswisher ,  Israel has usurped their land now they steal the Gas and Oil assets of Palestine. their Greed and Avarice is Obscene.
459 2018-02-20 22:57:12 To each his own. Never been one to guess as to what an athlete's attitude is or isn't and frankly don't care.
460 2018-02-20 22:57:07 So with a very conservative demand growth estimate to get a ballpark figure, global oil demand will be in the neighbourhood of 120mb/d by the time we reach $BP ’peak oil’.  Somebody had better start looking for some oil... #oott
461 2018-02-20 22:57:02 I just use a bunch of ogx products and double condition once a week. Ones a coconut oil, it works great
462 2018-02-20 22:56:45 @segalink @Tutsy22 @DemolaRewaju @beegeaglesblog we will have to bring a blue cock, the bladder of a crocodile, the teeth of a hen and 2 gallons of green palm oil. Abeg what sacrifice should Nigerians make again?
463 2018-02-20 22:56:04 Managed to get olbas oil in my eye. Would not recommend. 
464 2018-02-20 22:55:59 Turkey looking for a bigger piece of Syria now? How many children bombed today? #newsnight 
…meanwhile, how many barrels of oil from the occupied Golan?
465 2018-02-20 22:55:59 The only reason ur car breaks down @DawnStensland is bc ur @Richzeoli and think.the oil pan is an olive oil jar and needs to be totally full. @GREGSTOCKER @Himself3909
466 2018-02-20 22:55:54 Tea tree oil smells TERRIBLE
467 2018-02-20 22:55:45 Iya dipake sementara soalnya WHL lagi renov.. hmm apa harus arab oil invasi ke sini haha
468 2018-02-20 22:55:40 Like you & many others, I have no fscking time at all for the ladder-pulling motivational snake oil peddlers among us. They're cut from the same cloth as the fellas who brought us Brexit & President Trump.
469 2018-02-20 22:55:26 Whatever it was, he took a lot of maturing to get where he is now, and what he has in NJ is something he STILL wouldn't have in Edmonton.
470 2018-02-20 22:55:22 I tried the coconut oil in water before gym, incredible energy. Thanks @Boity for sharing, you're amazing!!
471 2018-02-20 22:55:13 A lot of birds, including some parrots, don't have the oil gland (uropygial gland) - Amazons and some of they macaws.  No one knows why not.
472 2018-02-20 22:55:11 Was thinking that myself. Probably not much harder to move grain than crude oil?
473 2018-02-20 22:55:09 Sounds like what she is saying is, she wants to NRA to cease to exists hence the kill the NRA hashtag. And by the NRA ceasing to exist is what she means that they have what is coming to them. Actually pretty easy to understand.
474 2018-02-20 22:54:53 I posted a thread earlier. I think that it was due to lofty expectations placed on himself to be a superstar that he was never able to realize in Edmonton. Most people saw him wearing a C at some point, maybe he did too, and couldn't figure out why Gagner and Ference were ahead
475 2018-02-20 22:54:52 Seafoam treatment and Lucas oil stabilizer are the best products by far 
476 2018-02-20 22:54:39 I saw you in your buggie on 72.. it’s from the oil spill 
477 2018-02-20 22:54:32 The The largest holders of our debt is China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters.
478 2018-02-20 22:54:30 Additionally, like I said, Carter was damned for NOT being supportive enough. And lets face it, his energy platform was not helping relations with nations that sourced foreign oil. But we were committed to Afghanistan, against the Soviet Invasion.
479 2018-02-20 22:54:26 Oil in the ground has only speculative value
480 2018-02-20 22:54:25 Hendrixx struggling right now I need gas a oil change and I hit this big ass pot hole
481 2018-02-20 22:54:24 You don’t need no more of that oil boi
482 2018-02-20 22:54:17 That is certainly the popular angle to be sure and yet during all those seasons of one failure after another, the  guy who stood up and took accountability time and time again was Hall.  Funny how that works.
483 2018-02-20 22:54:16 I just updated my Facebook and discovered a kiosk Mr Zuck opened called Marketplace. I thought I was going through an OLX app. This tech monopoly by Zuck is like J.D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly. #Facebook #tech #Monopoly #Zuckerberg
484 2018-02-20 22:54:15 Yes, there is merit in testing. However, before you decide to not change the coolant or oil you’ll want to make sure not doing so would represent a breach of your extended service warranty. It may be one of those “fine print” issues.
485 2018-02-20 22:53:59 The pressure at the oil change spot to actually know where the hood popping button is IMMENSE.
486 2018-02-20 22:53:45 Las cosas tan bien?
487 2018-02-20 22:53:36 I'm tired of Canada getting raped of its resources while we get next to nothing. We hold the power! Refine our resources and sell finished goods. Refine the oil, work the wood.
488 2018-02-20 22:53:35 Ship the oil south. Problem solved
489 2018-02-20 22:53:21 Holt is poorly so I bought him some Olbas Oil but he didn’t understand what it was and ended up frustrated and a little upset. Good grief.
490 2018-02-20 22:53:05 Wake up and smell the Anointing oil.
491 2018-02-20 22:52:23 Blue Sky Mine by Midnight Oil.
492 2018-02-20 22:52:21 I know for a fact all my exes will remember me by the oil stain left on their driveway left by my truck 
493 2018-02-20 22:52:03 That is where we disagree. Not exactly sure what how "his time in Edmonton went" even means. The Hall we saw over his last two yrs w/ Oilers was a far superior version to the one earlier in his career. He continued to improve but was in no way perfect. Was that the expectation?
494 2018-02-20 22:51:56 Full detailing, oil changes, and tomorrow re-tinting 
495 2018-02-20 22:51:45 That boy fleezy slicker than a slide covered in baby oil 
496 2018-02-20 22:51:15 Hashim thaqi taqi oil
497 2018-02-20 22:51:02 Thanks! So exciting and will bring sample oils , cheers 
498 2018-02-20 22:50:52 Definitely just almost ran over literally everyone who was trying to change my oil.
499 2018-02-20 22:50:50 Who probably fractured their wrist slipping on oil in a tech bay today???? ONLY I, AMBER THE DIAZ
500 2018-02-20 22:50:46 I think Denmark has plenty of oil.
501 2018-02-20 22:50:45 While you’re at it, thank Trump for allowing three highly sanctioned spies to enter the country. Thank him for further endangering YOUR CHILDREN by refusing to enact the Sanctions. For allowing sanctioned Russian oil & gas ships a safe harbor in our ports. Yes, thank him idiot.
502 2018-02-20 22:50:27 Tea tree oil is supposed to be good for acne scars.
503 2018-02-20 22:50:25 Let’s remember that his attitude just begged for being given a ‘tough time’.   Now he’s maybe getting the rules of life a little bit.
504 2018-02-20 22:50:21 I wouldn't outlaw all guns. Nothing against law abiding citizens having hunting rifles or a pistol for home protection. Just get rid of assault weapons whose only purpose is to oil lots of people very quickly.
505 2018-02-20 22:50:17 Cut off all oil supplies to BC and see what happens.....
506 2018-02-20 22:50:02 Its not only foreign reserves that went up bro. Our national debt went from 9 to 20 trillion. Fuel went from 87 to 145 to 250 naira.A bag of rice went from 8k to 20k.Big power oil went from 1200 to 2500naira,I better pass my neighbour generator went from 18k to 56k. Clowns!!
507 2018-02-20 22:49:57 Omg feel better if you can get oil of oregano get it and take it ASAP also thieves oil
508 2018-02-20 22:49:50 Oil and gas companies need cooks and food prep experts on offshore rigs!!
509 2018-02-20 22:49:47 I need to go get an oil change but I think I’m going to just run to Walmart an go first thing in the morning
510 2018-02-20 22:49:35 I have the farm to myself this afternoon for the first time in six months. Just made a beeswax candle and heated up a custom essential oil blend, now catching up on the very long back-log of tunes that's too weird to listen to with anyone else around. #MeTime
511 2018-02-20 22:49:34 I'm gonna use the ylang ylang floral water as a toner and the babassu oil for when I get out the shower. I'm also thinking about trying out the witch hazel to.
512 2018-02-20 22:48:52 Oil and power cant stop us ..
513 2018-02-20 22:48:50 Never fear! The lord hath punished me for cussing so much, as I added coconut oil to dinner last night not realizing it was body soap
514 2018-02-20 22:48:42 Waiting for an oil change is the worst 
515 2018-02-20 22:48:35 Haha not all of it! I had a few wraps put in my friends which grew into locks and I left them. But yeah they drive me nuts some days but my hair is a lot healthier with this routine. I need to invest in more coconut oil tho for the night before hair wash day haha.
516 2018-02-20 22:48:32 Does every 1L do a billion oil cases in Property, or is it just cuz this is Texas? How much does one possibly need to know about oil and fracking?
517 2018-02-20 22:48:29 We pulverize the C60 millions of times over a week. Pulverizing increases the frequency of C60. I might sell this pulverized form of C60 (no oil) if I thought people would buy it…
518 2018-02-20 22:48:19 A nation backed crude oil pegged crypto currency. I don’t see it being all that bad compared to 99% of the other crypto.
519 2018-02-20 22:48:02 No hes just removed protections so Putin&OTHER oil industies can drill in arctic&ELSEWHERE

Hes selling off our nations lands 2 likes of Kock bro

Letting coal mines pollute water ways

Might read the uranium one deal to understand what really transpired
520 2018-02-20 22:47:41 That's gross, gun barrel oil is not fit for human consumption.   At least wrap the barrel in foil first.

522 2018-02-20 22:47:40 I need to work on my peanut butter chocolate muffin recipe. It's a touch too dense. I think I cut back on the canola oil too much (to compensate for oil in the peanut butter). Maybe instead reduce the cocoa powder? 

Basically what I'm saying is I'll be making more muffins soon.
523 2018-02-20 22:47:25 Freedom bots are around for your own protection, it will uphold your values and democracy worldwide. US and its partner bots will bring civilization and religion to the darkest corners of asia, middle east, s.america, africa and all places with oil and gold and rare earths.
524 2018-02-20 22:47:24 People like you can protest all you want, but common sense will prevail, the pipeline will get built and Canadian economy will prosper for generations to come. All the fearmongerimg in the world won't change the fact that oil and gas are a vital export that we all benefit from
525 2018-02-20 22:47:11 She’s ... special
526 2018-02-20 22:47:02 "Don't feel too bad"

Boy, I didn't feel bad at all. You played me before and are randomly venting to me when I just need to find how to change my oil 
527 2018-02-20 22:46:58 I have applied so much tea tree oil to the most painful spot I’ve ever had the trauma of owning, I’m practically eating it 
528 2018-02-20 22:46:42 There's nothing "clean" about oil spills. We need solar and hydro and thermal. Oil needs to go.
529 2018-02-20 22:46:40 $65 for a oil change
530 2018-02-20 22:46:24 I don't think black lives matter care about the oil industry.
531 2018-02-20 22:46:21 #Radio Ya hablamos sobre la Intervención judicial de Oil Combustibles, principal empresa de Cristóbal López. Yaa en @ecomedios1220 Aireeee!!!
532 2018-02-20 22:46:16 Which one? The actor or the former FM of Scotland. He wisnae? Whale, oil, beef, octopus.
533 2018-02-20 22:46:08 Lol you don’t know the difference between a zygote, a fetus and baby. 

No I’m talking about the NRA that has bought politician’s inaction on sensible gun reform that the overwhelming majority of Americans support.
534 2018-02-20 22:45:35 Or maybe he needed to be traded to realize that he was the one making it a one way street.
535 2018-02-20 22:45:34 Trump is #soangrywithrussia for not buying his Trump Vodka. He was forced to sell it on the streets for 50 cents a bottle as an oil and stain remover.
536 2018-02-20 22:45:20 Can we buy oil with $PETRO COIN? It sounds like a LOOPHOLE against the economic sanction from US government. Anyway I see the future when Russia uses $GAS COIN if US-Russia relationship collapses.
537 2018-02-20 22:45:18 peak oil = max ever oil production. Literally what peak means.
peak Guardian = the most achingly Grauniad article that will ever be produced. Obv far jokier than the first. 
Has nothing to do with reducing something to nothing in either case.
538 2018-02-20 22:45:17 It looks like oil on canvas, so good.
539 2018-02-20 22:45:14 Right now I wish I had one of those essential oil sticks that help migraines
540 2018-02-20 22:45:10 Tea tree oil mmg oke, sy pernah pakai jugak dulu..lepas kne chikenpop, stop, mmg truk hancur muke, sampai abis smua kluar..last2 pakai 1produk organik ni, alhamdulillah
541 2018-02-20 22:45:00 opponents should question how dirty(carbon footprint) the rail transport of oil is (and the danger) . Pipeline IS the safer/cleaner choice...!!!
542 2018-02-20 22:44:48 Need to know what cameras these insta girls are using the clarity is wild, my pics are out here looking like oil paintings.
543 2018-02-20 22:44:33 honestly, life sucks when you go to change the oil in your car and you realize you bought 5W-30 synthetic instead of 5W-20....
544 2018-02-20 22:44:27 Dear Oprah, your origin is Hebrew Biafra. Your People are Slaughtered daily by British govt and the jihadists for oil , you have not said a word. Support Biafra Jews and Christians REFERENDUM.
545 2018-02-20 22:44:11 Who do oil changes for cheap.?
546 2018-02-20 22:44:02 Lot of variables go into when to change it and the condition of the oil at that point. Synthetic is better in most instances
547 2018-02-20 22:43:56 Just had a very hot bath. I think Peppermint oil helps. One problem when I have baths is that i still stay tense, and the bath is small so I'm all bunched up. So I tried to stretch various bits during the bath and detense myself. It helped a bit.
548 2018-02-20 22:43:53 Just to be sure  burning the midnight oil?
549 2018-02-20 22:43:29 always more to the story. If what he and his coach said today are 100% representative of the truth, then I see exactly why his time in Edmonton went the way that it did. I'm not saying it's entirely his fault but it adds up a lot more than what we had to go off of prior.
550 2018-02-20 22:43:26 Because North American oil companies plunder the oil there. 

Why would they want to hurt the stock markets that profit from it?
551 2018-02-20 22:43:23 Ok, let's explorer it..

1) How many borders will that create?

2) Who gets the North Sea Oil and gas.

3) What currency will NI, Scotland and Wales use, and how much spending money will Westminster have to give them?
552 2018-02-20 22:43:02 Can not wait to get some CBD oil, (tube) item currently sold out! You're doing good! (:+)
553 2018-02-20 22:42:58 finally found some coconut oil for my hair :'))
554 2018-02-20 22:42:37 I just took the longest, most luxurious shower. 

My skin is so soft and I’ve used up all of my Brazilian salt in oil body scrub.
555 2018-02-20 22:42:36 I have a couple charcoal cleansers I should be using by my face was in a dry spell so I kind of started holding off. Definitely going to need to try that oil and brand though, thank you!
556 2018-02-20 22:42:36 Alright. I'll reach there tomorrow. I hope they'll still be doing the promo
557 2018-02-20 22:42:30 Just because it's the first time we have heard him say it out loud doesn't mean it's taken out of context, he's probably been telling himself that for years. It's a talking point that gives a lot of credence to why he was traded. Sure you can say, "PC is terrible" but there was
558 2018-02-20 22:42:23 What SP will #UKOG open up at 2moro?? #oil #BROADFORDBRIDGE #HORSEHILL
559 2018-02-20 22:42:21 I keep quiet about the hog farm & the oil refinery tho
560 2018-02-20 22:42:18 Dunno. Just find it very funny. Everything was great but our (1 Michelin star Hedone sourdough bread at £1 for two pieces toasted with olive oil) didn’t have butter or balsamic so our night was ruined. 
561 2018-02-20 22:42:11 If this humidity keeps fucking around I’m gonna flip, whole face looking like a puddle of oil
562 2018-02-20 22:42:01 They told me to get an oil change in October, it’s February and my light just cut on
563 2018-02-20 22:41:56 I had a horse named Amber I'm not a bot go check your oil
564 2018-02-20 22:41:49 We vote. We eliminate these lobbyists like the NRA, big pharmacy, big oil etc from having so much control of the people’s power. We demand it. Together. Unity not violence.
565 2018-02-20 22:41:41 Good for you. I don't feel better. If I see anyone with a gun, I go in the other direction.
566 2018-02-20 22:41:37 My oil was on 5% all weekend. My shit on -2 now.  is my car gonna shut off?!!!
567 2018-02-20 22:41:37 i’m craving a Wawa ham and cheese hoagie with extra meat, with salt, pepper, oregano, oil and vinegar rn now.
568 2018-02-20 22:41:17 If the #TransMountain #pipeline isn't built what are the consequences? 

Chief @scotiabank economist Perrault says the expense of transporting the crude oil without a pipeline forces the price downwards--a pipeline would increase the profit for Canada

#ctvpp #cdnpoli
569 2018-02-20 22:41:13 Canada? Or the shareholders of foreign owned integrated oil companies who have set prices to their advantage for decades?
570 2018-02-20 22:41:11 Planned Parenthood?
571 2018-02-20 22:41:10 Spend a pan -- those little extra cooking oil.
572 2018-02-20 22:40:50 Ok cool. Lets burn this midnight oil. 
573 2018-02-20 22:40:46 Oil and Gas have been "rogue" for years. With a Corp owned media, we're just been excluded from hearing about their recent spills and wreckage.
574 2018-02-20 22:40:44 Vanilla cake made with tangerine shortbread icecream as a substitute for the oil 
575 2018-02-20 22:40:22 me: wow i can't believe people buy into this wellness bullshit
also me: *rubbing retinol oil into my face using a jade roller having done an hour of yoga*
576 2018-02-20 22:40:21 Watching ITV London news and just heard a woman who had a years worth of hair in her loft for an art project. She’s stuffed it all inside her tights to stop and oil slick on the River Lee. Did someone just spike my drink? 
577 2018-02-20 22:40:21 I make cardamom pancakes in coconut oil. Divine! And my cardamom & white chocolate chip cookies are always a hit. It's my go to secret ingredient when baking.
578 2018-02-20 22:40:21 Agreed, Most of the palm oil needs to be community and smallholder based. This is the model being explored in Liberia via the Norwegian funds. But @foe_us sound like they fight it at all costs w/o giving Liberia a chance to find a workable model. That’s harmful to Liberians.
579 2018-02-20 22:40:17 Changed my windshield wipers, got some cleaning stuffs, an air freshener, and car mats. Now I just gotta do my oil change this weekend
580 2018-02-20 22:39:50 Palmers stretch mark oil and cream. It's a whole little set at least like twice a day! Soon as I stopped using it they came it  So don't stop!
581 2018-02-20 22:39:45 My wife would probably take issue with that.
582 2018-02-20 22:39:44 Just finished eating about to soak my hair and face in coconut oil
583 2018-02-20 22:39:31 Crying bc it takes 700 gallons of water to produce 1 barrel of oil
584 2018-02-20 22:39:28 I guess it’s a sort of ‘pick your battles’ scenario. I personally don’t consume many almonds or almond products because I dislike how resource intensive they are when there are less RI foods available. 

What you’re asking is sort of like the ‘is palm oil vegan’ debate
585 2018-02-20 22:39:23 Worried oil seed rape changing too
586 2018-02-20 22:38:57 Trump has spoken a lot about oil. Remember him saying, “I would’ve taken the oil.” Putin and Trump are both in it, in part, for oil.
587 2018-02-20 22:38:46 Trump is allowing 90% of our US coastline to open up tp oil and fracking. No sane person will buy that he suddenly cares about anything, but himself, and taking other people's money.
588 2018-02-20 22:38:38 Hillary did and her biggest supporters were also oil industry lobbyists.  I hope you were this upset with her a couple years ago.  Somehow I doubt it.
589 2018-02-20 22:38:36 mixing them ;-; and then make small and then with oil
590 2018-02-20 22:38:16 Go with Full Synthetic your maintenance minder can adjust over time. With full synthetic you only typically have to change oil twice in a 12 month period depending on driving habits. But once you go synthetic don't go back to conventional
591 2018-02-20 22:38:16 If it is a corporation it is a “person.”
592 2018-02-20 22:38:11 Shiddddd it was all a dream. I miss working in a school with the autoshop class, them kids was professionals for pizza.  What car even allows 19.99 oil changes now?
593 2018-02-20 22:38:08 Shazam!!!!!!!!!!!! Where's the suntan oil?   
594 2018-02-20 22:37:57 Orphaned wells ? They are always made from crude oil.
595 2018-02-20 22:37:53 Let’s just add to my bad luck... the only oil my car can take is $87. So that’s cool.
596 2018-02-20 22:37:48 thanks for the oil btw.

598 2018-02-20 22:37:38 No thanks. You should put a sign on your forehead saying "bad guy" in case the police need to be warned.
599 2018-02-20 22:37:30 What oils do you use for your babies skin? I put jojoba in Rs bath but wanna know what else I could use. I also have sweet almond oil and coconut
600 2018-02-20 22:37:24 The oil companies have found ways around reclamation. Drain the resources dry, then file bankruptcy, which means they can not afford to do any clean up. Now the issue falls onto the government and eventually the public. A number of these cases are already in the courts...
601 2018-02-20 22:37:22 America loves hoarding up that oil. Guess that's why gas prices here are so cheap. What would be awesome is if we had our own oil. Maybe build like a pipeline or something that I'm sure people would never complain about.
602 2018-02-20 22:37:00 いいなぁ～クエリーちゃん！

トク玉で当たるなんて...w
603 2018-02-20 22:36:50 I suggest you go back and study what 'peak oil' actually means. Did you do this in school?
604 2018-02-20 22:36:49 I don’t believe in bias but I do believe that Buster Posey is gonna win the triple crown while Crawford hits 30 HR & 120 RBIs. Belt is gonna hit 40 HR & 140 RBIs while Bumgarner solves our oil crisis and McCutchen breaks the all time HR record this year. You don’t think so?

607 2018-02-20 22:36:15 I’m alone in my new place for the first time. It feels great.

Also I spilled a bottle of lavender oil so it smells pretty great, too.
608 2018-02-20 22:36:02 Snake oil sales is an absorbing state for nutters. Look at Infowars*

609 2018-02-20 22:35:51 @twhite0723 @spaldingjag ....remember when Trump said more jobs, done! Eliminate Isis, done! Lower Small Bus. TAXES, Done! Bringing back drilling for coal and oil, Done!...etc., etc., etc. Long story short....he's followed through w/ as many Promises as the Democrats would allow!
610 2018-02-20 22:35:45 yupp

612 2018-02-20 22:35:32 So fed up with my skin.. it’s so dry I’m slathering my face in oil/moisturiser and then breaking out in 4591 spots the next morning...

616 2018-02-20 22:35:18 It's called a frustrating situation that was made worse by a revolving door behind the bench. I think people are reading too much into that quote as a stand alone. No question he had his faults but taking too much from one sentence seems silly.

633 2018-02-20 22:33:04 The problem is that you never get physical oil in exchange of petro. They juste promise to accept it to pay taxes or other venezualian public services. That makes all the difference.
634 2018-02-20 22:33:02 That’s oil & has for you!

636 2018-02-20 22:32:45 you reset that timer. its based on miles. feel free to ignore it.

my leased golf did 40k miles between oil changes and the oil was still pristine. I wouldn't recommend that, but it shows you how long it lasts. it went 5x the distance and could have done more.

644 2018-02-20 22:31:37 Sovereign Cryptocurrency backed by oil, gas and gold. Could that pull the string on inflation rate that has destroyed the national currency? Will that restore "stability" in the monetary environment? This is the case we are closely following with Venezuela. #Note.

654 2018-02-20 22:30:32 Agreed. Trump is an existential threat to the Republic. We can re-litigate the merits of the Iraq War when this huckster & his gaggle of snake oil salesmen are out of the WH & behind bars.

670 2018-02-20 22:27:20 it would be standard oil from the factory. at any time you can switch from regular to synthetic. going the other way you need an engine flush.
671 2018-02-20 22:27:15 I’ve been told beard oil helps.

So fake dinosaurs . . . are made from real dinosaurs.

681 2018-02-20 22:26:23 It looks like a starch clump. Not pretty, but harmless! Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. Over time they collect in the oil, stick together and form clumps. We inspect for these but missed this one. I'm sorry!

693 2018-02-20 22:25:13 Blaming NRA, which encourages the safe use of firearms, for a massacre is like blaming flying clubs for 9/11 or car enthusiasts for drunk driving accidents.
694 2018-02-20 22:25:11 Really? You understand the difference between income and expense v long term assets? The last 50 years has seen a massive increase in public and private debt while cselling off our countries resources. Eg North Sea oil. Public utilities. Pensions.

All we see is your blaming EVERYONE but Putin!

711 2018-02-20 22:23:27 So 2030 GHG emissions from the oil sands in 2030 could be anything between 77 and 91 Mt, depending on technical assumptions?
712 2018-02-20 22:23:26 They are not "rebels." They are terrorists breaking up the country for oil profiteering. They have no #SITG. You do.
713 2018-02-20 22:23:18 Minuswell change it yourself lol. RT @EastPointMadeMe: My shade tree mechanic charges  $20 for oil changes but you have to bring your own oil & filter. Comes out to about $60-65 total
714 2018-02-20 22:23:07 The rising price of crude oil, mostly.
715 2018-02-20 22:23:04 oil painters get so much respect from me. painting in general drives me up the wall... sargent and nc wyeth style is especially nutty "looks detailed, zoom in and that eye is just a single paintstroke" go f-f-f-fuck yourself
716 2018-02-20 22:22:58 Won’t people support added taxes for schools?  Or everyone going to just let them take the oil and skeddadle.
717 2018-02-20 22:22:56 Maybe try the clay mask again and then oil your face after 
718 2018-02-20 22:22:45 So, my problem isn't jsut with oil sands... but with oil.  It's an industry that is responsible for irreparable harm to human health and the environment.  Someone certainly needs to continue pointing that out, & planning for a future (hopefully soon) when we won't use it any more

729 2018-02-20 22:21:17 It might bring us wealth...  but you've probably not seen how shipping channels dug for oil and gas have reshaped the Louisiana wetlands (I lived there)...   nor how the BP oil spill continues to cause health effects in people that I know.  It's absolutely criminal.

734 2018-02-20 22:20:46 If my hair gets too dry feeling I’ll put argon oil in it. My favorite dry shampoo is bumble&bumble it’s in a grey can at Sephora or the dove one works good as well
735 2018-02-20 22:20:40 Not me! Just the baby wipes, day and night. Maybe once a month I'll do a cucumber peel. I only just started wearing foundation, for those fancy evening things, otherwise it's been eyeliner, mascara & lipstick. Teatree oil on occasion.

746 2018-02-20 22:19:16 Depends what you want from your people. Would you rather they all simply fall in line and never question or would you rather someone who asks questions and looks at different potential paths...especially when things are not working? For me, I'd much rather the latter.

751 2018-02-20 22:19:02 Id like to see these people run to Saudi and start picketing there and blocking oil. They do it here because the government backs them up, and solely for that reason, if the government didn't back them up, they wouldn't be here. Time to take a stand.
752 2018-02-20 22:19:02 My shade tree mechanic charges  $20 for oil changes but you have to bring your own oil & filter. Comes out to about $60-65 total

798 2018-02-20 22:14:13 Is the Venezuelan state actually putting aside 100,000,000 barrels of oil (or equiv contracts) to back the $PETRO? Because if they're just creating $PETRO and selling oil as normal, this is a nice little one-time $1.1 billion USD windfall for the government. 
799 2018-02-20 22:14:08 It’s all about oil. That’s why we have this particular Secretary of State.

801 2018-02-20 22:13:38 Rob, you're a manager. That sounds like typical coach-speak for "man he's good, but you really have to work with him." Which connects all of the dots for me about why the Oilers moved on from him. Essentially saying he needs motivation that Oilers couldn't provide.

862 2018-02-20 22:06:29 @Audi Looking for Midwest Audi Rep contact info. Oil consumption prob ultimately destroyed my catalytic converter. Piston rings replaced now issue with cc. #replace or minimum supply parts #dotherightthing

864 2018-02-20 22:05:57 No don’t do that the railroad commission is actually a very important regulatory body that largely oversees the state’s oil and gas industry
865 2018-02-20 22:05:38 CBD Oil tastes like licking a pile of perfumed lawn clippings

868 2018-02-20 22:04:57 #Venezuela' economy is going into a spiral of dysfunctionality, mostly because of the mismanagement of the government that didn't try to diversify the economy when the oil prices where high, instead, they invested that money in ridiculous social programmes and what this was...1/2
869 2018-02-20 22:04:46 I can handle chilly. My hair is so frizzy and curly there’s not enough coconut oil to save me
870 2018-02-20 22:04:23 Trump is #SoAngryWithRussia he appointed Rexxon Tillerson Secretary of State, an person with zero diplomatic experience but much Russian oil deal experience.
871 2018-02-20 22:04:13 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-02-20, is 6.8.
872 2018-02-20 22:03:37 Were they 'so called' when you were buying oil from them?
873 2018-02-20 22:03:36 #BBNaija How often do you watch other channels since Big Brother..??..This show is more powerful than the Nigerian Economy, Both upstream and downstream oil sector..
874 2018-02-20 22:03:26 It was for oil.
875 2018-02-20 22:03:13 Saying it’s hurting there families what about our oil patch families there hurting
876 2018-02-20 22:03:12 Or you could call the place you get it changed at and have them tell you based on the type of oil you get how long should you go in between oil changes.
877 2018-02-20 22:03:05  would've been like "It's all good baby ...just turn over& hand me the baby oil."

882 2018-02-20 22:02:30 i can believe oil does because oil can become rancid, but salt...no.
883 2018-02-20 22:02:24 Of course, #brexit won't ditch the country into a mad max scenario. Mad Max was about how we all need to reduce our dependency on oil...
oh dear...
884 2018-02-20 22:02:24 The chassis on the ground and getting stuck or breaking shit like cracking an oil pan on a rock.

886 2018-02-20 22:02:18 Why does everything run out at once, makeup, skincare, and just looked and my hair oil and it is empty  LIFE.

888 2018-02-20 22:02:00 I’m putting Jamaican castor oil on to my beard does anyone know how long the effect will take to see improvements?
889 2018-02-20 22:01:53 I wish we could beat them at camp nou
890 2018-02-20 22:01:48 I get really expensive oil changes and it’s supposed to last longer than that. I just don’t know how long. 
891 2018-02-20 22:01:45 I said good.. F'cos it would have been better with a striker but the don't have a striker, they have Alvaro and Olive Oil.
892 2018-02-20 22:01:43 That just looks like car oil has been poured over it
893 2018-02-20 22:01:38 Leikmaður á heimsmeistaramótinu í pílukasti var sendur heim vegna þess að ólöglega efnið "PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED SOYBEAN OIL" fannst í blóði hans. Þetta er eitt af innihaldsefnunum í Snickers.
894 2018-02-20 22:01:08 Yaah mehn
895 2018-02-20 22:01:00 Why does an oil change take so long
896 2018-02-20 22:00:58 And if Marco Rubio, Trump or any human being sees what we are going through and is willing to help? We thank them! Not you, leeches! Who for some oil look the other way. 
897 2018-02-20 22:00:56 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this February? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
898 2018-02-20 22:00:48 Yeah, chocolate's definitely a cover-up - fruits definitely seems a good match! Also thought about possibly extra-virgin coconut oil for a bit of tropical flavor with the grassiness
(Alas, my Flavor Bible doesn't have a specific category for this particular flavor >.>)
899 2018-02-20 22:00:45 Gold long time cause of war. Now add oil. Both tear up the earth,environment. MMT ppl (they have #) think we can eternally print our way out of this.
900 2018-02-20 22:00:40 OIL DIFF: 3.41 -> 3.45
901 2018-02-20 22:00:38 February 20, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
902 2018-02-20 22:00:36 Late 90's Barbara Walters did series on prisons. Pell Grants went away, education opps dried up. Prisoners had it too good, by her standards
903 2018-02-20 22:00:34 Soros wasn't a Nazi. He was a child (a Jewish child at that) right through WW2.

Are you sure you weren't thinking of noted GOP donors the Koch brothers and how their family fortune came direct from Nazi oil?

No?
904 2018-02-20 22:00:32 I think you could be right...could get tickets you know. Seats available still. Barcelona did play well though. Looking forward to the away game...
905 2018-02-20 22:00:17 "Thyme oil is good for getting rid of acne and blemishes" .... if you want to burn your face off maybe

910 2018-02-20 22:00:02 @bobsbrgersfdtrk when is the next food truck festival?? “Oil spill!!!” #itsnotsubtle
911 2018-02-20 21:59:42 Oil meeeeeee, hyu-mahn.
912 2018-02-20 21:59:36 U need some help with that oil
913 2018-02-20 21:59:35 Good luck my dude !!! Make sure to get the ones u plug in to an outlet! There’s also a different type of calming product it’s like a gravy oil thing u put on their paw so they’d have to lick it or eat off their food & it’s similar. These 2 products together is like magic
914 2018-02-20 21:59:21 Immaturity is no surprise and the fact they surrounded those players with no veteran presence that could help them along the way & have an impact on the ice is on the organization. They did those kids no favours.
915 2018-02-20 21:59:20 I am a liberal independent  and what I don’t want is to be kissing my kids in the morning sending them off to school and praying to god they make it till 3:pm. You are a snake oil woman selling BS.
916 2018-02-20 21:59:03 Very few bacteria survive frying in oil, which is what one typically does with pancake mix.
917 2018-02-20 21:58:47 Yes it would be useful to actually TAX all that oil money so you can have SCHOOLS.
918 2018-02-20 21:58:39 Or if your views on marriage, abortion, guns, etc are different; you're vile, should be shouted down with the hecklers veto, abused, lose your job, scared for your kids, etc.
919 2018-02-20 21:58:37 Let's find out!
920 2018-02-20 21:58:32 the baby oil gel application right before you get out the shower is undefeated
921 2018-02-20 21:58:30 Just got my oil changed now gotta get two tires
922 2018-02-20 21:58:28 I just eat olive oil and cold chicken tikka masala for fun mate
923 2018-02-20 21:58:27 Lol amma that mistake was costly, wasa ya zama sabo
924 2018-02-20 21:58:26 I just had to drop $200 on my car . Wow! Went in for an oil change and then boom. Another issue 
925 2018-02-20 21:58:05 Have you reported this tweet??
926 2018-02-20 21:57:51 Shame unto the nation that produce oil and still have scarcity to the masses #ShameOnYou
927 2018-02-20 21:57:37 lavender oil
928 2018-02-20 21:57:35 Barca have that vital away goal.. it will be tough in the Nou Camp
929 2018-02-20 21:57:25 There is nothing in his statement that suggests he was a bad teammate...none. The misconception that many have in which athletes all need to get along on a team is not only laughable it's downright idiotic.
930 2018-02-20 21:57:23 When you accidentally spill a little bit of an essential oil in the office and almost immediately get a text from @chey_fred asking if you put said oil on 
931 2018-02-20 21:57:14 girlllahhhhh i have the cocoa butter baby oil ready ! Lmaoooo
932 2018-02-20 21:57:10 I hate when someone other than my grandfather changes my oil
933 2018-02-20 21:57:07 Cleaning up 120 barrels of spilled oil is exactly what I wanted to do with my day. 
934 2018-02-20 21:56:59 No. It isn't.
935 2018-02-20 21:56:51 Is anyone going to search for, capture and clean the birds affected in the River Lea/Lee oil spill? Someone needs to attend to those waterfowl covered in oil. #riverlee #oilspill #waterfowlrescue #wildliferescue
936 2018-02-20 21:56:41 My right hand constantly shakes and has done for a few years. Bought some CBD oil just to see what it’d do and it’s literally completely stops the shaking in a few minutes :o
937 2018-02-20 21:56:19 #UKOG - Does someone know something retail investors are currently unaware of? Despite todays RNS, market makers balanced the books. It appears that there was no shortage of buyers at 1.9-2.0p Interesting day ahead tomorrow! #BroadfordBridge #Oil #Gas
938 2018-02-20 21:56:19 If you look at my other subthread, I'm a founded member of a gun-owning household. I don't have an issue with responsible use of guns.  But the stuff the NRA is putting out there is dangerous.

940 2018-02-20 21:56:05 more snake oil from sanders today.   step right up folks, nothin to see here, mozy on down to obama tent.
941 2018-02-20 21:55:51 No he isn't. Silly.

Are you sure you're not thinking of, noted GOP financiers, the Koch brothers with their daddy's Nazi oil refinery?
942 2018-02-20 21:55:51 He certainly didn't mature hanging out at oil city roadhouse after losses. That's for sure!
943 2018-02-20 21:55:46 This time of year it's still all about the roasted root veggies for me...I toss them in a bit of olive oil and herbs and put them in the oven until they're like veggie-candy. 
944 2018-02-20 21:55:43 BS. I and many ppl work in secured facilities with single point controlled entry surrounded by fences/barbed wire/ cameras. Not a prison.
945 2018-02-20 21:55:12 @CWHemp Can give my dog the same olive oil flavored Everyday Plus that I use (using the dosages based on the CW Paws guidelines), or is there some other difference between CW Paws and the Everyday Plus that make that a bad idea?
946 2018-02-20 21:55:02 ...oil’spill’ port, more likely. #StopKM
947 2018-02-20 21:55:00 Dana Loesch's ads make me think that she and the NRA loathe people like me--normal, everyday soccer mom types who happen to be politically liberal-- to the core of their being, so I'm pretty much closed to anything she has to say, and she did it all herself.
948 2018-02-20 21:55:00 Biochemically palm oil is fine, its just rarely produced sustainably which means we are sacrificing old growth forest and orangutan habitat to produce it
949 2018-02-20 21:54:54 To be clear I am not short gold. But might short oil.
950 2018-02-20 21:54:28 Kept hillary out of office depriving them of more uranium, oil, gold, silver, lead and sulfur and $$$$$
951 2018-02-20 21:54:24 have you ever tried/made  za'atar man'ouche or za'atar, feta cheese, & olive oil on roasted tomatoes?
952 2018-02-20 21:54:23 i added a car wash to my oil change lady said dam must got taxes 
953 2018-02-20 21:54:22 *puts black castor oil in her hair and expects it  to have grown 6cm by tomorrow
954 2018-02-20 21:54:10 Remember to get your Anointing Oil close to you as we Pray tonight @ 12 Midnight

Please pass this around to your friends and loved ones.
955 2018-02-20 21:53:58 If you don't mind the smoke, before you put them in, rub with veg oil or sunflower oil,sprinkle with salt.....amazing
956 2018-02-20 21:53:52 I have a good friend who is a NRA member and took me shooting at their range down in Virginia where everyone was perfectly nice.
957 2018-02-20 21:53:51 I like truffle oil... not sure mom would like the smell of my arse after chilli oil! 
958 2018-02-20 21:53:45 Deporting illegal aliens would reduce by 20- 25%. Pretty good start since why are we providing resources to ppl who will be deported anyway?
959 2018-02-20 21:53:41 Sure, I sliced the tofu and marinated it in mustard, salt and pepper and a bit of oil. Left it for a couple of hours. Then I dipped in flour, then oat milk and seasoned breadcrumbs. I then layed them on parchment paper and baked them on 180 for 15 mins on each side. That's it 
960 2018-02-20 21:53:40 Everyone is talking inflation. I think we will see deflation or very muted inflation. Oil headed down. Same for gold. $SPX down.
961 2018-02-20 21:53:33 there were lots of people saying the immaturity and poor teammate comments about Taylor Hall after the trade was merely slander. This is pretty pretty clear evidence that it wasn't.
962 2018-02-20 21:52:48 The brand skin foods! It's Korean I believe and it's sold at Ulta. Their products are so gentle and I've seen definite results. I also use jojoba oil as a make-up remover and face serum. Charcoal cleaner's helped me with my acne but was drying so combat it with moisturizers!

964 2018-02-20 21:52:42 No boiling oil on the ramparts?
Pah!

965 2018-02-20 21:52:42 And America's stupid population -- the only American demographic said oil & gas robber barons + Russia were capable of conning.
966 2018-02-20 21:52:41 Ok... so the year was 1984... all the oil fields were broken and Marty McFly was president... I was just a wanderer trying to make my way and Jackie was hustling middle school kids out of their pogs behind the dumpster out back of the football field
967 2018-02-20 21:52:32 Now available: @HomesteadBeerCo Snake Oil Super Pale
968 2018-02-20 21:52:29 Tea tree oil is quite the magic! Just a bit yikes about the lavender essential oil, it can be a tad bit irritating!  I wholeheartedly recommend @aboutliahyoo, she's a skincare genius, just recently made a vid on essential oils! 
969 2018-02-20 21:52:28 It wasn't a charity drive to get oil to the EC, it was commerce.  The economics did not add up.  You can't just create a self-serving reason, in an effort to stoke your cause, and be considered reasonable.  If your goal is to appear like a zealot, good on ya.  It works against u.
970 2018-02-20 21:52:26 What do you call erdogan when he buys oil from Isis?
971 2018-02-20 21:52:20 I’ve been taking biotin, using horse shampoo/conditioner, and putting coconut oil in my hair. I just want it to groowwww.
972 2018-02-20 21:52:08 Oil of oh hey 
973 2018-02-20 21:52:03 They don't want the oil drips on their own driveway lol
974 2018-02-20 21:52:03 Chelsea did well...
975 2018-02-20 21:51:39 Care to talk about how your illegal #TransMountain #pipeline and 400 tankers/year in Vancouver is going to wipe out the Southern resident #Orcas, accelerate #climatechange and violate human rights in Canada? FRAUD alert. Oil>China=more ocean plastic garbage!
976 2018-02-20 21:51:26 Yea
977 2018-02-20 21:51:24 someone teach me how to change my oil please. I bought the stuff I just need to know what to do
978 2018-02-20 21:51:10 Welcome to the Republican controlled stonewallers club. Their roadmaps are laid out well ahead of time by the nasty paymasters (e.g. the NRA, Big Sugar, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Insurance, etc.). They demand max return on investment without fail. Voting against $ NEVER happens.
979 2018-02-20 21:51:09 #EminenceWinter Rosehip Tricle C+E firming oil!
980 2018-02-20 21:50:59 For all those Oilers fans who are ripping Hall for his comments...give your heads a shake. Guy is essentially telling everyone just how difficult it was to play for this organization during much of his tenure...but go ahead & focus on whatever angle you'd like.
981 2018-02-20 21:50:55 Spot on. Have now managed to eat well (& meat 1/2-1/3 of days) for £30 a week (for everything incl. toiletries and alcohol), but that requires buying big items like 2kg bags of flour, a range of herbs, oil, plastic tubs ahead of time. Starting from nothing, £30 is impossible.
982 2018-02-20 21:50:41 Are you an NRA lobbyist? Are you involved with bribing politicians to permit more kids to die?
983 2018-02-20 21:50:36 Can you image how gross he must feel eating that crap everyday.  Just look at his face, the oil is oozing out of it.  I can't stand him but I don't wish him dead.  I do wish someone would step in and take over his eating.  We want him to live out his prison sentance, don't we?
984 2018-02-20 21:50:24 So, second successful heat cycle complete. I've changed the oil and filter before refitting the fairings. It'll need a wash, but I might even get out on it this weekend! #Triumph #TriumphTT600 #WreckedBikeRebuildUK #BringOnTheTrumpets #CyclistsBeWarned #UnderpantsHeadlight
985 2018-02-20 21:50:22 kkkkkkkk  Barca lacked that extra Olive Oil
986 2018-02-20 21:50:21 There are millions of Pakistanis in KSA/GCC who send largest chunck of $20 Bln remmittences. KSA is our largest oil supplier, provided deferred payment option when we had financial issues in past. In 1990s, under sanctions, free oil was provided.
987 2018-02-20 21:50:11 A nice oil massage would be life rite now
988 2018-02-20 21:50:08 Which is exactly what NRA does.
989 2018-02-20 21:50:02 look, I'm a trash human being. I consume all this shit by the oil drum. I guess I'm just aware that I'm doing it.
990 2018-02-20 21:49:58 @laborgovph @alanpcayetano @arnellignacio @etulfo2011 - Sec Bello on Kuwait OFW ban, ito ba ang pagbabago? kami mga oil and gas engineers, aircraft mechanics etc. hindi kami DH oh my God Mr. President..we are professional OFW's..for god sake..help and be fair..
991 2018-02-20 21:49:51 Company whose business is to produce oil says publicly demand for its product is going to peak in 15-20 years (about two investment cycles away). What’s the positive? IR guy doing his job: spinning for company. Or you expected to tell you to sell the shares?
992 2018-02-20 21:49:47 Put some lavender oil on your pillow before bed and you'll feel so chill.
993 2018-02-20 21:49:41 Thanks! 

Would love to see a story with quotes or recordings of Assembly Appropriations Committee members explaining why they're apparently so gung-ho on dirty offshore oil drilling.
994 2018-02-20 21:49:32 We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say

995 2018-02-20 21:49:15 The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives"
996 2018-02-20 21:49:05 Scotland has been run by a Tory government for most of the time since oil was discovered and yet you keep telling us how shit and poor we are. Oil + Tories you get fucked over in order to make sure they and their pals are alright.
997 2018-02-20 21:49:05 Today at work someone threw fryer oil on my hand which is strange usually the people I work with are more passive aggressive
998 2018-02-20 21:49:02 Mate, you need to brush up your history.  Russia has been in Syria all along, over 60 years. Why are they incentivising their mercenaries to seize oil and gas in Syria ? Because they are trying to use energy as a weapon against the free world.

The discount simply reflects poor quality.

1137 2018-02-20 21:30:24 Dairy and soy caused this problem for me as did gluten. Dairy protein intolerance hit 3-4 years after going GF. Soy then quickly followed. Many vitamin preps including Vitamin D contain soy oil or soil lecithin. Unreal that supplements would contain any of the 8 major allergens.
1138 2018-02-20 21:30:15 Lavender essential oil is a natural sedative. It promotes relaxation in your nervous system. At times when you feel stressed or your conf...
1139 2018-02-20 21:30:03 う、うちの親と全く同じ──────
1140 2018-02-20 21:30:03 Not so fast my savvy, high tech friend...higher gas prices means product pricing at stores will be pushed on to the consumer...but we would all love to see more electric cars and the oil companies take some of the hit.
1141 2018-02-20 21:29:59 Tea babe. All the tea. Tell him to buy you a whole cupboard’s worth. And run you a hot essential oil bubble bath while he’s at it. And also make you some chicken noodle soup (not from a can - you don’t need that recklessness right now) with bone broth since he’s already there.
1142 2018-02-20 21:29:56 Can you guys pls recommend good essential oils for my dry skin and PLS don’t disrespect me by saying coconut oil
1143 2018-02-20 21:29:49 #Have Better Skin This Summer With Fish Oil Supplements  #article 103743 @netdatabiz
1144 2018-02-20 21:29:33 Pro...not probably, auto correct grrrrr.
1145 2018-02-20 21:29:28 
1146 2018-02-20 21:29:18 Put the bit in a vice and use a wrench on the once  black threaded keeper that you turn to unloosen it  soak it with penetrating oil but personally I would go to a pawnshop and get a new one and charge said employee for time and the price of it
1147 2018-02-20 21:29:09 God bless coconut oil
1148 2018-02-20 21:28:55 Funny how Russia is behaving themselves now isn’t it? Maybe the US reentry as a major producer in the world oil market fixed their wagon?
1149 2018-02-20 21:28:52 They're probably killing especially if the victim is an innocent unborn baby.
1150 2018-02-20 21:28:48 You: *has literally any chronic condition* Them: Did you try plant-based? Keto? CBD oil? Snake oil? Rubbing garlic on it?
1151 2018-02-20 21:28:44 Make sure your exfoliant isn't drying you out. A warm, soft washcloth is often enough. My forearms are even dry this winter. Ugh. I've started using l'Occitane almond oil in the shower. It's made a huge difference. I bought some of the Syrian soap bars so will try one too
1152 2018-02-20 21:28:43 I'd love it if kids would stop being killed as well, however, if every gun is confiscated from law abiding citizens, criminals will still obtain them. The FBI KNEW this kid was a problem and did NOTHING. If we enforce the laws we have, this could have been prevented. #DisbandFBI
1153 2018-02-20 21:28:37 And Margaret Sanger!
1154 2018-02-20 21:28:33 Hair Grease FC comes on to oil out a winning goal.
1155 2018-02-20 21:28:08 @CNN Trump’s economic policies are crushing Russia.  Energy policy alone is killing them.  We are on track to be largest oil and gas producer.   Far more effective than sanctioning a couple of Russians who will never be in the U.S. or seize a couple of diplomatic properties.
1156 2018-02-20 21:28:00 Missed #CorkToday on Is a drop in oil prices good news for motorists, #Mallow man updates us on the situation on receiving a life saving drug for his condition Alpha 1, Food Bank at #Tralee college @KcfePrincipal, Discussing relationships & more - Repeat at 11pm
1157 2018-02-20 21:27:58 In the Bizarro world of the Left everything is pretty much the opposite of what you'd logically expect, hence fascist becomes antifa. Proclaim being anti violence then advocate violence to further your cause. Misinform, obfuscate & blur lines while advocating public clarity.
1158 2018-02-20 21:27:42 薄荷油って名前だけど薄荷油使ったことないです
1159 2018-02-20 21:27:40 Nope.  Gang bangers and terrorist don’t get to wave their guns around because there is a right to own firearms.  Just like you don’t get to draw your gun on a cop as a right.  Now answer the question.
1160 2018-02-20 21:27:24 Running around the day before we leave for Convocation. All the things! Pick up flyers. Oil change for the Honda. Mail book orders. Dinner with @spiralingfire. Pick up @Liabra from the airport. Whee!!!!
1161 2018-02-20 21:27:12 Welcome home.  Good to have you back this side of the pond.  (These are mainly black oil sunflowers)
1162 2018-02-20 21:27:09 that coconut oil is useful on dry skin caused by exposure to lunar dust, tho.
1163 2018-02-20 21:27:09 Literally so blessed. To my knowledge my truck has never had an oil change. So that might be my first step! Loving the concern tho
1164 2018-02-20 21:27:07 The point that the growth in OECD economies is de-coupling from carbon is true. What's also true is that growth in the developing world is still carbon intensive. That's where the growth in the global demand for oil is coming from. And it is growing.
1165 2018-02-20 21:27:01 You sound like the type of person that pays someone else to change his oil.
1166 2018-02-20 21:26:57 @jaketapper oil is the most pressure on Russia.  Trump is pushing more oil while Obama shut it down. Wake up. Fools.
1167 2018-02-20 21:26:52 Knew someone had a bad back. Grew a huge garden and had 0 problem running a tiller or basically doing anything else. Scamming plain & simple
1168 2018-02-20 21:26:52 First of all, Not all fires are extinguished with H2O
✓Electric fire =>use CO2 extinguishers
✓flammable liquids, grease. When an oil pan catches fire, Don't pour H2O.
✓the worst combustible metals NEVER ever use H2O, water helps to propagate fire. 1/
1169 2018-02-20 21:26:51 Similar thing happened in Far East where allies were left at the mercy of China. China has got a huge space to grow its heft. Here at least US is showing some signs that it wants to be back. In Middle East it seems US has given up as they don’t need Oil.

1172 2018-02-20 21:26:26 Irrelevant.  The kid reached for a gun.  Is the NRA supposed to deny a cop the right to shoot if he feels his life is threstened as any reasonable person would be for someone reaching for a gun?

and if you somehow fuck it up or the pan gets sticky? idk man just throw some extra butter in there next time you're cooking, god forbid
1178 2018-02-20 21:25:45 The level of ur stupidity amazes me and its quit entertaining. I voted Trump dipshit. Did my comment about MLB or MLS touch a nerve? And what oil rich family are u talking about? U sound like ur just trying to hit some catch phrases lol We're you in a special class or something?

1184 2018-02-20 21:24:56 The right to bear arms means the right not to be shot for doing it.
1185 2018-02-20 21:24:55 points at my oil painting i’m doing rn “boy That’s a Mood”
1186 2018-02-20 21:24:55 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1187 2018-02-20 21:24:54 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
1188 2018-02-20 21:24:46 James' panties are all twisted.
1189 2018-02-20 21:24:46 I indulge myself with a soaking bath  while I read 2 x week. I may even put on a face mask. I rehydrate my skin with coconut oil afterwards.
1190 2018-02-20 21:24:43 Scared Snowflakes ?
1191 2018-02-20 21:24:40 The CBD oil is for my physical pain I don’t need it for my “head” my head is fine
1192 2018-02-20 21:24:31 Sean how dare you ofcourse oil is real it’s black gold
1193 2018-02-20 21:24:28 Irrelevant of smelling weed.  Its illegal to carry a firearm and drugs.  Castille had 6 grams in center consile in his car.  Thus He was illegally carrying a firearm.  Is the NRA suppose to support people carrying guns and drugs?  Answer the question.
1194 2018-02-20 21:24:27 Should I just trust my car to tell me when I need an oil change or should I check it myself? 
1195 2018-02-20 21:24:24 Sounds like she needs put into the NICS system. That much delusional angry directed at a group of law abiding citizens sounds like a mental illness.
1196 2018-02-20 21:24:14 did the mean lady hurt your feelings Will???  

Looks like the NRA has Snowflakes too
1197 2018-02-20 21:24:07 Going on 2 hours for an oil change. Nice
1198 2018-02-20 21:24:00 Being disabled is way expansive. Personally knew someone it turned into an alcoholic and destroyed her life. $1,200 a month to kill herself
1199 2018-02-20 21:23:58 I wake up every morning next to a headscarf & coconut oil, I’m married to a black queen #ThisIsUs #catchingup #BlackGirlMagic
1200 2018-02-20 21:23:49 I might as well live in my car, I’m always in this bitch anyways.  it hasn’t even been a month & I need an oil change again. 
1201 2018-02-20 21:23:49 *sees choco pies at store - buys*
Me: these taste good

1207 2018-02-20 21:23:08 The US remains a net importer of crude and is obviously dependent upon what OPEC does as the 250+ bankruptcies; $250 billion in lost capital; and $200+ billion in lost annual GDP since 2014 demonstrates.  $60 oil is also courtesy of Russia and OPEC.
1208 2018-02-20 21:23:06 literally drenched my scalp in oil this morning and you wouldn’t even know it by touching it smh
1209 2018-02-20 21:23:05 Remote area vehicular transport as well. Jatropha grows in extremely arid areas. Produces oil almost exactly like diesel. See mercedes jatropha. Millettia is another, mostly suited to areas already in cultivation.
1210 2018-02-20 21:23:00 My coconut oil melting is a great representation of how my day is going
1211 2018-02-20 21:23:00 He gave them an oil rich island off Alaska, lifted sanctions Bush had on them, & broke missile agreements that kept them in control
1212 2018-02-20 21:22:58 Vitamin E oil!! You might not need it for the smaller stretches but the bigger you go, yes.
1213 2018-02-20 21:22:34 The Prius is a good car. They're hard to kill. An old boss of mine would routinely go 15k miles between oil changes (Toyota recommends every 5k), and he never had major problems.
1214 2018-02-20 21:22:33 Hahahaha baka kelangan pa ng oil or vaporub  cheret!
1215 2018-02-20 21:22:22 And what percent of the land that oil companies have mined has been turned back into forests and wetlands?  I'll bet you anything it's less than 5%.   This is all PR.
1216 2018-02-20 21:22:07 1. saute zucchini/bell pepper/garlic/green onions in olive oil in a wok
2. when the veg gets brownish/soft, dump some rice onto it and mix
3. mix in soy sauce + oyster sauce
4. make a small space in the middle and crack an egg OR just fry an egg in a different pan
1217 2018-02-20 21:22:06 Of course Pruitt hasn’t lost Trump’s confidence-stealing from the American people and lying about EPA are literally what Trump and the oil industry picked Pruitt to do.
1218 2018-02-20 21:21:52 Oil isn’t necessarily bad for skin. 

“Oil-free” moisturizers cause more problems than they solve, because your skin has to produce extra oil to make up for it.
1219 2018-02-20 21:21:48 I think you don't give a shit about the second amendment if you think a cop who breaks down in tears during firearm training should be allowed to shoot children.
1220 2018-02-20 21:21:48 The rest of us really don't want to think of what it will be like if the left is successful, think Warsaw & the Jews, think Stalin, Hitler.
1221 2018-02-20 21:21:46 Avoid a breakdown, get your oil changed already.
1222 2018-02-20 21:21:43 No aumentaba y los impuestos que tiene la nafta los hacian correctamente. Como OIL...
1223 2018-02-20 21:21:41 Maybe AAA is a terrorist organization, more people are killed by drunk drivers than guns, and that doesn't even include the people killed in other accidents.

1240 2018-02-20 21:19:38 Evidentially objectives British Forces not been secure oil output/mineral wealth revenue such is price of British fuel at approx £1.30 per LITRE

1242 2018-02-20 21:19:21 Oh gee, more drilling in the western wilderness? No thanks. Oil and gas need to retire and make way for renewables.

1246 2018-02-20 21:19:03 Labour seem hell bent on destroying capitalism. Finance is the oil the makes everything else work!!!
1247 2018-02-20 21:18:58 We'll aren't you a special kind of stupid,
1248 2018-02-20 21:18:51 It takes the most expensive oil lol
1249 2018-02-20 21:18:31 Let's all vote this year for politicians that hopefully can not be bought by the drug and gun and oil and gas companies! 
1250 2018-02-20 21:18:27 Felt like I was back in high school again when I got so bored in my oil and gas valuation class that I ended up playing games on my calculator. It’s like a flashback to chemistry class.
1251 2018-02-20 21:18:19 Being in industry, the royalty conversation always annoys me, it’s a complex issue. (Aging, expensive basin).  Back in the 70’s nobody was thinking near term in Oil Sands development, and access to the resource was cheap.
1252 2018-02-20 21:18:18 It poured vr-12 in my motor at the oil spot
1253 2018-02-20 21:17:44 What power plants are you running this yr @j66anderson gotta have that steam under the hood
1254 2018-02-20 21:17:29 No apparently not, none of them have been charged, the @FA are a joke, we’d get nailed big time for something like this, guess the oil money is just too good to turn down
1255 2018-02-20 21:17:04 #mansplaining  versus reality day 1 you don't have the £1.12 for the oil. You have that to feed your self that day. Bulk buying isn't the option. So what do you do? The oil will last a few months but you have nothing to cook in it.
1256 2018-02-20 21:16:56 In the winter we wear Cocoa butter & Vaseline. In the spring & summer we wear Aveno & coconut oil

1260 2018-02-20 21:16:13 Oil rig
1261 2018-02-20 21:16:12 How can we stop people willing to commit murder, and in most cases die in the process, from not breaking gun laws? A person willing to exchange their own life to kill someone is a nightmare scenario even for Secret Service details.
1262 2018-02-20 21:16:06 Dips life in coconut oil*
1263 2018-02-20 21:16:05 Which essential oil will help me convince my wife that getting a motorcycle would be both fiscally and environmentally responsible?
1264 2018-02-20 21:16:02 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
1265 2018-02-20 21:15:53 A country that swaps oil for weapons and bombs hospitals and starves children. Please tell me why Australia is helping Saudis? Does anybody know?
1266 2018-02-20 21:15:39 And if you’re looking to just add color 20vol is where it’s at. And always prep your hair using mask and a tip from me is color your hair dirty, so the oils of your natural hair helps protect it. And lastly always use a hair mask, or coconut oil after the color.
1267 2018-02-20 21:15:37 ?? What’s ignored?? She calls NRA an organization-then refers to “them”.  Implying she is talking about people.  What are conservatives ignoring??? Specifically?

1270 2018-02-20 21:14:46 At least with #RussianMeddling you get a policy decision by a somewhat power hungry politician. When we (#USA) meddle, it's because plantation owners, oil & construction tycoons are leasing whichever administration as a means to an end. United Fruit Company, Standard Oil, Exxon
1271 2018-02-20 21:14:44 Denmark are funding their electric car program from selling oil to the rest of the world. They green though right.
1272 2018-02-20 21:14:16 Nah this oil change turned my shit to a M5 
1273 2018-02-20 21:14:10 How much CBD oil mg/day would you typically recommend for addiction? opiods, drugs, booze, PTSD?
1274 2018-02-20 21:14:07 @justinboots... Bought a pair of boots about a month ago, waterproofed them with mink oil and they're now falling apart.... Great to spend $200 on a pair of boots that are falling apart in less than 60 days of owning them
1275 2018-02-20 21:14:07 No deep fryer... but the pan is full of oil - Missing a point here BRUH!
1276 2018-02-20 21:13:56 Snake oil......
1277 2018-02-20 21:13:53 Gorgeous for my hair to look .....b-OIL-utiful  Thanks #LFW xxx
1278 2018-02-20 21:13:52 i don’t use coconut oil on my face now mostly bc i don’t put anything on my face but just didn’t know why i shouldn’t
1279 2018-02-20 21:13:46 This is going to matter a lot if someone starts targeting and killing NRA members. You don’t see how this rhetoric could be a big problem?
1280 2018-02-20 21:13:42 If we could outlaw lightning strikes we would..

Cancer kills far more than both of those things, but it's fallacious to believe that we should only legislate the "worst" thing. As a rule if we can stop people from dying, we should. Agree or nah?
1281 2018-02-20 21:13:36 What of mine 
1282 2018-02-20 21:13:35 Boutta oil up these legs and go to Tootie house in shorts 
1283 2018-02-20 21:13:34 Thanks I have made @philly311 aware of this issue a few times & the landlord but nothing gets done. The oil is environmental unsafe & the trash is disgusting. It's annoying trying to keep your area clean when other people don't & they don't recycle either.
1284 2018-02-20 21:13:22 Regarding Idaho & Montana:  Move them to "FSA" & give "PRS" an "easement" between the 48th & 49th parallels.

We need a way to get pipeline oil.

1287 2018-02-20 21:12:58 I think I might be willing to take the bet that Albertans would rather give up the part of their economy that relies on the oil sands than the part that relies of 50% of all car and plane travel.
1288 2018-02-20 21:12:58 Not surprised the  FA are corrupt they  must of taken a bung from the oil baron 
1289 2018-02-20 21:12:45 IT'S NOT A BABY NAME. 

It's the name of a guy who changes your oil.

For or against, this is done minus legislative action.

1293 2018-02-20 21:12:13 So who has used Caster oil on their lashes?? 

Iv always used Revita lash and it's fab, but caster oil is a fraction of the price.
1294 2018-02-20 21:12:07 Albertans or at least this Albertan does not want trains and trucks transporting dangerous chemicals of any kind, to or from BC ports, to cross through Alberta and since oil is apparently bad BC oil should not be transported by pipeline across Alberta either ...

1298 2018-02-20 21:11:15 What hand can anoint my wounds with oil?
1299 2018-02-20 21:11:13 #10: In 1923, LA produced 1/4 of the entire globe's oil. It sits atop the 3rd largest oil field in the USA. #zine #dimazine #eastwest #wcsu

1302 2018-02-20 21:10:54 we’re playing vengabus at top volume and mina just spilt hot oil in the food bin and someone’s at the DOOR and I’m astral projecting
1303 2018-02-20 21:10:44 Fixed LOW due to artificially low Canadian natural gas and oil prices DUE TO NO PIPELINES. BTW, big chunk of fuel cost is federal excise taxes. Look at the pump next time you fill up.

1307 2018-02-20 21:10:07 Err battery EVs are currently powered by coal powered electricity. Consumption of oil can drop but emissions will not.

1311 2018-02-20 21:09:49 Awe! I miss that car! I blew the engine in it though...apparently checking the oil in a turbo’d car is a thing! Haha
1312 2018-02-20 21:09:47 Yeah, i sure do miss the guy that let the BP oil spill continue on when he was being told how to stop it. Or the guy that gave Iran nuclear capabilities, or the guy that divided this nation based on race and set us back 40 years in race relations.
1313 2018-02-20 21:09:40 NO - YES to HFLC (coconut oil / MCT / butter / avocado etc etc)
1314 2018-02-20 21:09:38 It’s competent people who actually know what they’re talking about trying to talk sense to snake oil peddling charlatans. Yes, clearly speaking truth to incompetent egomanics doesn’t work very well.
1315 2018-02-20 21:09:36 Would you prefer to move oil through the Rockies on trains?  Your choice, trains or pipelines.

1317 2018-02-20 21:09:07 Yes. Jesus would be ashamed of anyone who dared to take his name on his or her lips while supporting the murder of unborn children. Faith in Jesus Christ and the support of abortion are like oil and water. They do not mix.

1324 2018-02-20 21:08:47 Castile:  He was illegally carrying a fire arm.  Do you think NRA should support people carrying drugs and firearms?  Rice:  is the NRa supposed to deny a cop a right to self defense when someone reaches for a gun?
1325 2018-02-20 21:08:27 He went in deep today 
He needed a oil rig drill to hit that low
1326 2018-02-20 21:07:28 @RBuafor WE LOVE YOU DADDY, MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESSING WITH FRESH OIL. AMEN
1327 2018-02-20 21:07:24 @KevinBrasier Please read my post again, I only used that as an example of what is going to happen to the FBI investigation into NRA and Russia involvement, nothing, absolutely nothing.
1328 2018-02-20 21:07:15 I owe u 10 gallons of fuel at galaxy oil inside spintex
1329 2018-02-20 21:07:11 But again... Who cares? You're all amazing people, does that make you feel better? If anything, you should be upset that non-NRA members are giving you such a bad name and seek to do something about it?

1331 2018-02-20 21:07:04 If we stopped for even a second and put half the energy into caring for veterans at home more than caring for making big oil money & fighting “wars” that we don’t need to be in, then we would be in a much better spot. If we do not have money to care for veterans, we have nothing.
1332 2018-02-20 21:07:00 Have you tried mint chocolate chip flavoured or olive oil?
1333 2018-02-20 21:06:58 It’s too bad that shell oil  removes any requirement for Canadian oil in the US 
1334 2018-02-20 21:06:57 It was made for Serpessence, the "snake oil".

1336 2018-02-20 21:06:40 Why don't we do like the Bible says and shut that country down? Set the oil fields afire and divert the Euphrates river so the Persian Gulf will fill with sand, they cannot be healed.
1337 2018-02-20 21:06:28 DO NOT PUT COCONUT OIL ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR FACE
1338 2018-02-20 21:06:24 The AARP is not a person. It also is an organization.

This isn’t really that confusing.
1339 2018-02-20 21:06:24 Most  SME's will not pay taxes if they don't make profit. We have terrible infrastructural deficiencies. If We must solve all this problems yes everyone needs to pay no matter how small.  We cant sustain the economy on revenues from oil alone

1341 2018-02-20 21:05:54 Or maybe when you gave Russia a pass on the "made in America" requirement for the pipelines? Or the pass you gave them in oil trades with North Korea? Or allowing their oil tanker to doc in the US? Or in allowing them to arm Assad? Or do you mean overcharging them for condos?
1342 2018-02-20 21:05:49 Oil is running out

1344 2018-02-20 21:05:07 Andrew, the graph you put up on twitter a few days ago had GHGs from the oil sands rising to about 90 Mt by 2030, but the one you published in Macleans has GHGs rising to 77 Mt. Something changed? Could you share a link to the CAPP data on emissions from the oil sands?
1345 2018-02-20 21:04:51 The NRA is an organization, not a person. 

You are a person and not the NRA. 

Ergo, no one is saying they want to kill you.
1346 2018-02-20 21:04:29 Do they've it aplenty to sustain all the citizens? No. So it's practically as they don't have anything. Diamonds and golds are not oil.

1348 2018-02-20 21:04:24 Tory times are tough times, but you know - you have to keep up with those tax cuts to corporations, oil companies and the rich!
1349 2018-02-20 21:04:16 EZ shares +0.8%, US shares -0.6% (not helped by a disappointing Walmart result). US 10 yr yld +1bp to 2.89%. Oil +0.4%. Iron ore +0.3%. ASX futures -0.5%. $A 0.7880

But you basically need a face wash/face masks/toner or face cream..  tree oil is good for irritated pimples and just pimples in general
1353 2018-02-20 21:03:38 only to have the ruling party give guns back only to those supporting them to ensure they stay in power. Their people are leaving in masses and all you have to do is ask them if they regret giving up their gun rights.

1355 2018-02-20 21:03:35 That's something else going unsaid here. It's not like most of these kids were Students for Trump members prior to the shooting. They were all most likely hard core liberal to begin with. They're from Broward County after all.

1369 2018-02-20 21:02:11 Problem.... over 2000 years of history. Better solution is to stop buying oil and let the Middle East settle back to the way it was.
1370 2018-02-20 21:02:05 And turned west as they left the desert. GO EAST ya morons -- there's lotsa oil there!

1372 2018-02-20 21:01:57 I can assure you that my thinking is in no way binary. I happen to believe in learning from history. If you need a modern reason for the 2A just look at Venezuela. What was once a vibrant Democracy, went socialist, gave up their gun rights in the name of safety, and then...
1373 2018-02-20 21:01:52 As a bowler, I can see the correlation with #curling. Even the sweeping makes sense to me now. It would be like if bowlers could actually adjust the oil pattern on the lane while the ball is rolling. OK. So I’m slightly less confused now.

1378 2018-02-20 21:01:02 I'm saying the risk is in the price. Centrica has a covered 9.2% dividend plus rising oil prices and strong cash flow and the negative sentiment you get during situations like this.
1379 2018-02-20 21:01:00 The question I always come up with is, should I use these fancy branded beard oils, or should I just be using some kind of oil that's more affordable

1384 2018-02-20 21:00:48 Yep. That’s the problem when your economy is based on oil and the world price dives.

1398 2018-02-20 20:59:11 Although it is theorized that there are oil reserves along the northern coast of Cuba, it is estimated that they are quite small.  Several countries have secured leases there, but only Repsol has drilled wells.  3 wells, 3 failures.  Repsol has since relinquished its leases.
1399 2018-02-20 20:59:07 lets face it, a good few of the TFSA are just there hoping to steal fridges tractors and olive oil

1404 2018-02-20 20:59:00 She called it a “terrorist organization”, so members of this organization are terrorists by definition. Hard to not take it that way. Certainly, there are idiots out there that will take it that way as well. Nothing good can come from this. #2A
1405 2018-02-20 20:58:46 Just a little side note, this is the flavor oil which makes ‘Earl Grey’ tea.  And if you add a few drops to a vanilla scented candle, it creates a wonderfully sophisticated aroma.
1406 2018-02-20 20:58:28 I still feel spacey . Smoked some saphire oil and it did help clarify me a bit.i think i did well on the presentation. I am trying to read my textbook now but having a ton of trouble concentrating
1407 2018-02-20 20:58:16 Oil and coal appear so big because so much has to be wasted to get to the end user. Your argument is bollocks.
1408 2018-02-20 20:57:56 Won’t be necessary. She’ll just bore us to death in the end.
1409 2018-02-20 20:57:43 don’t let coconut oil anywhere near your pretty face! HIGHLY comedogenic.

1412 2018-02-20 20:57:21 John Kelly is alternating dipping one of Trump's hands in olive oil and the other in peanut butter so he keeps dropping his phone while licking the PB off, then he switches hands and the cycle starts anew.
1413 2018-02-20 20:57:10 Try this a customer got an oil leak repaired now he’s blaming us because his backup camera doesn’t work? Like wtf does that have to do with anything
1414 2018-02-20 20:57:09 I’m a member of the @NRA too...and I’ve spent my entire adult life protecting others from harm (incl. #POTUS, #VPOTUS etc.).  Be assured that I always keep my head on a swivel, but it would be nice to know what I have coming for me...
1415 2018-02-20 20:57:02 Finally got the oil out of my hairty @lexilunaxoxo for the tip! It really worked
1416 2018-02-20 20:57:01 No, but it was just a mass of waxy, syrupy palm oil.  Turned my stomach even to take the lid off; went straight in the bin.

1419 2018-02-20 20:56:44 Liberalism is nothing more that just an emotional response to their "feelings". They don't think any position or situation through. They just go with how they feel about it. If they thought, then they would be conservatives.
1420 2018-02-20 20:56:33 I went to the pain clinic today, and they prescribed me hydrocodone-acetaminophen twice a day, and they want me to use that CBD oil. Im ready for some relief
1421 2018-02-20 20:56:30 Not digging the 1.5 hour curry as an ‘easy alternative’ to takeaways and think guilt-free label for cake made with: coconut oil, honey, 70% chocolate, peanut butter and bananas is plain confusing #JoeWicksTheBodyCoach
1422 2018-02-20 20:56:14 I’m actually embarrassed to be up here getting my oil changed. I’m only 8,000 miles overdue. Like literally no oil in my car, motor about to blow up fuck it tho
1423 2018-02-20 20:56:05 You are correct, some members don't agree with some things the board has done. Do think that we don't all support their fight for the second amendment. What most fail to realize is that the atrocity that happened in FL was due to Law enforcement breakdown not the gun.

1426 2018-02-20 20:55:42 There is more than one type of oil, and not all polymers come from fossil fuels. Many people are not even aware of the alternatives.

We need to phase out fossil fuels, otherwise we will be stuck in the past with expensive, dirty energy.
1427 2018-02-20 20:55:36 Misspelled EMOTION.  Nothing but facts.
1428 2018-02-20 20:55:34 The lawyer’s father-in-law, German Khan, also has connections to state run Russian oil company, Rosneft, via TNK-BP where he served as executive director, and TNK-BP was sold to Rosneft. (multiple sources, but you can read at Wikipedia for “German Khan”)
1429 2018-02-20 20:55:25 You mean "Zassar"....that's a favourite here...agree it's too oily though. Guess the oil is mainly used as a kinda preservative
1430 2018-02-20 20:55:25 @BBCNews reported Assad supporting IS, highly unlikely when his forces actively fighting IS

1433 2018-02-20 20:55:10 Honestly, I fear we are on a slow march that direction. Might be only a matter of time. Nobody thinks about the consequences of their words anymore.
1434 2018-02-20 20:55:03 OMFG THANKS. I didn’t think of that, I was just using my oil cleanser but that glue is hell to get off

1439 2018-02-20 20:54:07 Ah, that's good then. I had visions of it being something like an E-vape thing using a special oil that runs out after a few uses.

1450 2018-02-20 20:53:01 ...Granted the mix mushroom, mangetout & asparagus gyoza with ponzu dressing are @marksandspencer but the sesame oil griddled tomato & chia seed warm salad plus spring onion, edamame and braised celery (yeah cook your celery) side with chilli lemon & soy dressing were all me 2/2
1451 2018-02-20 20:52:57 My back-up plan for when my liver falls out is to cover salt, vinegar, olive oil, and the like. I'll have to change the website to Condimendation or something ;)
1452 2018-02-20 20:52:51 Do you fix the leak or just add oil? Its quicker to just add oil but it better to fix the leak. Someone hell bent on death and destruction will still find a way to commit terror. Im all for common sense gun regulation. We have alot of laws on the books,we need better enforcement.
1453 2018-02-20 20:52:49 That Spanish olive oil is bomb

1467 2018-02-20 20:51:06 These people are the modern day snake oil salesman. Sad considering people are actually working hard on these problems.

1473 2018-02-20 20:50:15 That there is "Peak Huck" is the best thing I've heard today, because maybe, like Peak Oil, it means it's all about to run out.

1482 2018-02-20 20:48:35 I’m worried where the agenda idiots promoting #KillTheNRA is going. Do they not understand what they are saying or doing. They are going to get far more people killed. If they outlaw guns then only people who can make bombs and grenades will get them and use them.
1483 2018-02-20 20:48:35 And doing it for a week when you probably already have store cupboard herbs, spices, oil, toilet paper,  deodorant, shower gel, washing up liquid, sanitary towels & other essential would make it much easier to do.  Try having to decide which of these or all to do without!
1484 2018-02-20 20:48:32 There are NRA members, I sure hope someone doesn’t start targeting them. This could escalate quickly.
1485 2018-02-20 20:48:24 That may be true. But their concerns are quite specialized. As is for farming, oil, arts, etc. I think more people would question the legitimacy of keeping guns prevalent over even things like outdated curricula or pesticide use.

1487 2018-02-20 20:48:06 I just want some Chinese food. I need the oil to suck up this liquor.
1488 2018-02-20 20:48:05 Question - what was the role of oil prices within the O&G investment cycle when Chavez changed his mind?
1489 2018-02-20 20:47:47 The cost of debt/YA means it's uninvestable....they need £10 for every £1 of the company ..it's a noose round the next 
Even if ANY oil..let alone commercial ..it will NEVER see light of day before UKOG go to dogs

1499 2018-02-20 20:46:40 He did just kill 300 Russians in Syria, made life harder for Russia diplomatically and economically thanks to revving up our oil and gas production. Obama sold out our Eastern European allies on missile defense, slow-walked aid to Ukraine and did  nothing when Crimea was annexed.
1500 2018-02-20 20:46:27 And there’s no way you can argue with a pint of Neck Oil
1501 2018-02-20 20:46:19 If you can define your term we can discuss that.  Otherwise we should ere on the side of not banning things.
1502 2018-02-20 20:45:49 im not too familiar with this sort of thing but breathing exercises are always good and if that doesnt help you could try lavander kalms, theyre just tablets of lavender oil but they help me when im having an anxiety attack :)
1503 2018-02-20 20:45:44 Yeah, Mauritian dishes don't tend to be spicy in themselves; we make them mild, and then you can add condiments like pima confi (pickled chillies) to taste. We also use less oil and more fresh herbs and spices, hence the fresh flavour.
1504 2018-02-20 20:45:42 I use "Abra-Cadabra". It works as well as the magic you ascribe to "God's awesome Grace and Power".

1510 2018-02-20 20:44:47 Yes, and there is a special council looking into Trump/Russia collusion that has yet to prove any such collusion existed after a year. Same thing will happen with this FBI investigation. Russia did do something, they used the media to drive a wedge separating this country.

Cheers man 
1520 2018-02-20 20:43:08 Actually, that's not what you said in your op-ed. You said, "(the Paris target) is unachievable with oil sands expansion," and that oil sands output will not grow with priced carbon - results that don't show up in a lot of your previous work.
1521 2018-02-20 20:43:07 why does coconut oil make me smell like raw potatoes fsdjksd
1522 2018-02-20 20:43:04 Because most cartridges are shitty distillate which is black crappy oil that has been put in a roto vap and washed to make it look clean. Get only carts that are HTFSE not distillate and you'll have a way more pleasant experience
1523 2018-02-20 20:42:51 @realDonaldTrump Second paycheck since new withholding tables...same net as since July 2017. When will this windfall find MY paycheck?  You are a carnival barker selling snake oil. And an illegitimate president.
1524 2018-02-20 20:42:37 @JulieAnnSilver are you calling for violence?  Are u going to kill the NRA with a Gun???? You are proving why the Message of the Left about gun control is not the objective of the Left at all?  You don’t want to solve the problem do you??

1541 2018-02-20 20:40:00 How much oil do you expect UKOG to produce and in what time frames?
1542 2018-02-20 20:39:53 Nivea almond oil cream.  def recommend

1547 2018-02-20 20:39:10 today is a very historical day for me! 

for 32 months in a row, i received a letter rejecting my application to be a nude oil painting model.
1548 2018-02-20 20:39:07 You just need some Nivea almond oil cream!! Best ever

1550 2018-02-20 20:38:56 Members of the NRA did comment on the Philando Castile case. The thing that most people that have never carried concealed don't understand is that everything he did went against what any instructional organization teaches and not to mention he lied on his CCW permit application.
1551 2018-02-20 20:38:30 Oil change! Yaaaassss.
1552 2018-02-20 20:38:29 We need Sovereign wealth fund to participate in the global investments, by owning shares in the top 100 global companies to back our commodity reliant economy, Dubia is doing it cause they know oil will run out and in our case platinum gold coal will run out we need a plan!
1553 2018-02-20 20:37:50 All of oil
1554 2018-02-20 20:37:50 Just ask @tonyseba @rethink_x he can predict from the outside in. Oil & Gas trends will sky rocket down as renewable energy @Tesla @ZENenergyau rapidly becomes the natural resource for the world.
1555 2018-02-20 20:37:48 Give it a rest with the coconut oil. Bit gross #JoeWicksTheBodyCoach
1556 2018-02-20 20:37:23 BP expects personal vehicles and industrial trucks “to be dominated by oil,” with demand for the fuel comprising around 85% of total transport fuel demand in 2040, compared with 94% today.
1557 2018-02-20 20:37:19 Great first half considering the team selection Hazard and Willian up for this. Small tweak Giroud or Morata for Pedro. UpTheChels #KTBFFH we got this #CFC
1558 2018-02-20 20:37:11 In my entirely non-scientific poll of two companies I own stock in, oil tankers (FRO) are not doing at all well, and refineries (VLO) are doing very well,  Can we refine more, ship less? It's hypocritical to claim to be green if we're exporting dirty and importing clean(ish)
1559 2018-02-20 20:36:26 Oil and Gas in Biafra belongs to all Israel through Joseph to Manasseh and Ephraim to all their descendants in Biafra. Referendum is the answer.
1560 2018-02-20 20:36:18 Kinda looks like the tardis is piloting through frying oil.
1561 2018-02-20 20:36:14 Thanks @MaySimpkin I used your recipe in @UKThermomix and they came out so delicious & fluffy, taste even better with vanilla coconut oil @Jeeva_Naturals

1563 2018-02-20 20:35:54 Chef Noel recommends that you use cottonseed oil. However you may use any vegetable oil you wish when making #beignets. #CupcakeHour
1564 2018-02-20 20:35:52 that's what bothers me..like Trump can literally come to manbij if anyone threatens their oil and their existence there.. but who cares about Afrin now? no oil here.!!
1565 2018-02-20 20:35:38 Coconut oil and drink lots of water.
1566 2018-02-20 20:35:28  Does Luxembourg have oil fields
1567 2018-02-20 20:35:17 The economy was like a old stream engine with out oil,  now  it's all oiled up and ready to run at full steam ahead it  needed someone with business sense not a politician that can't balance a checking account, the government is a big business

1570 2018-02-20 20:34:47 dang. my friend suggested hemp oil which I might try?
1571 2018-02-20 20:34:43 Now I can’t help coming up with really bab home remedies, the kind you’d find in a lifehack video. “Make a paste: 1 tsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp Ajax scrub. Now apply it gently to your screen...”
1572 2018-02-20 20:34:16 Totally agree about personal responsibility. But it cannot be enough. Government needs to establish infrastructure, supportive financial framework, encourage communities to invest in local renewables. A new Infrastructure Act aimed at renewables, not oil & gas, is key.

1579 2018-02-20 20:32:53 But again, the NRA isn't a person... So don't be upset when the NRA is scrutinized, it's not a reflection on you personally.
1580 2018-02-20 20:32:51 I came in for a smog check and an oil change and now I’m getting my serpentine belt changed nice
1581 2018-02-20 20:32:46 Somehow I don't think so. No matter how you ant read it, all you have to do is read the Federalist papers to know what they meant. SCOTUS has already expounded on the subject.
1582 2018-02-20 20:32:46 Awesome news! We are loving how the oil pipeline industry is expanding in Canada as a whole, and the pipeline management industry in Canada! So proud to be a Canadian company, especially at the moment! #oil #Canada
1583 2018-02-20 20:32:44 What does the"A" in NRA stand for, knucklehead?
1584 2018-02-20 20:32:32 Today’s highlights so far:
-woke up early and finished cleaning the house
-got my oil changed and car washed
-got coffee at Dutch bros
-went to the library

All completed with Danny of course

1589 2018-02-20 20:32:04 Why does my skin emit more oil than usual when I’m traveling?? I mean, for the most part I’m just sitting for long periods of time... 
1590 2018-02-20 20:31:38 Very true.  Sucks we lose more scoring on wings.  Wonder if oil couldn’t have asked him a month ago for a list of several teams to do a sign n trade.

1595 2018-02-20 20:30:36 it's a bit strange how I love olive oil but dislike olives
1596 2018-02-20 20:30:35 I can put an entire bottle of lotion AND coconut oil on and I’ll still have ashy ankles smh someone help
1597 2018-02-20 20:30:33 it depends on your skin really! but i personally use vitamin serums like b12 and C and tea trea oil afterwards

1599 2018-02-20 20:30:15 Washed my car after getting an oil change and shits covered in snow again lol. Good thing I got unlimited washes.
1600 2018-02-20 20:29:59 What has the Paris climate agreement done for you or anyone else? You realize that fracking was wildly promoted under obama and both Hillary and trump were planning to continue  alonnwoth pipelines and oil spills without consequence
1601 2018-02-20 20:29:55 I need to go get a oil change but I don’t feel like driving 
1602 2018-02-20 20:29:52 Not surprising. And I'll bet that video goes into something along that effect. I mean - he's a smart dude and everything, but still a snake oil salesman. I'm sure that if one of his little fans sees this, it'll make them tard out and virtue signal everywhere.
1603 2018-02-20 20:29:48 Modern day snake oil salesman. The King of advertisments.

1607 2018-02-20 20:28:41 Not enforcing the rule of law isn't small Government it's no Government or anarchy. 

All oil and gas wants is a predictable set of laws and regulations that can be relied on.  The rules should ensure that the public benefits are bigger than the impacts.  Why is that so hard.
1608 2018-02-20 20:28:26 Wow, I believe I'll get a membership... Thanks for the help Julie
1609 2018-02-20 20:28:14 Because until the assets are proven to produce at commercial rates for a sufficiently long period of time the oil will stay in the ground
1610 2018-02-20 20:28:13 I understand why egg rolls are bad as leftover food, anything cooked in oil generally is, I just wish it wasn’t the case.  #TrumpColluded
1611 2018-02-20 20:28:12 Humanity has to change the paradigm of evolution from “war factor” to “exploration of universe” and we could really live happier then ever! The real problem are the bankers and secret oil and war industry magnats which strictly mind their “own” business.
1612 2018-02-20 20:28:10 ..or maybe that was sesame oil...I cook the same way, just start tossing it in without really measuring.
1613 2018-02-20 20:28:07 put some oil in my car and changed another cars battery. Level 2 engine build NVQ really paying off

1624 2018-02-20 20:26:21 Check engine. Something is wrong. May need an oil change. Take it to auto zone they acn diagnosis it.

1631 2018-02-20 20:25:55 Oh well. At least oil is above $60 bbl and Euro Dollar is still in the 1.20 ro 1.24 range.
For now.
1632 2018-02-20 20:25:43 She is correct about one thing, the NRA is not a person, it is millions of people. Those that bash the NRA seem to ignore that it is not a corporation, but a member organization with millions of members living throughout the US.
1633 2018-02-20 20:25:01 well, where a society's conscience doesn't evolve towards equality, economics may force the hand. Look at Saudi Arabia, opening up to women's rights after realizing all there's to gain from it in economic activity and their urgency to develop economy beyond reliance on oil
1634 2018-02-20 20:24:48 My skin is the clearest it’s been in months, I just want to thank rose hip oil and lactic acid. Love you xo
1635 2018-02-20 20:24:45 I was recently reasoning with some wise elderly Rastamen who put it in my head that the reason for all this extreme violence we are currently witnessing in Jamaica is because oil has been discovered there & this is a deliberate plan of destabilization before a grab for resources.
1636 2018-02-20 20:24:39 After spending the best part of a week chasing a seemingly invisible oil leak, I found it!!

1648 2018-02-20 20:23:26 The lawyer Mueller charged with a federal felony today is the son-in-law of a Putin ally. That ally is connected to a Russian oil company and Alfa Group—whose pinging of Trump Tower systems during the campaign was never explained. So this charge isn't as far afield as some think.

1650 2018-02-20 20:23:14 The biggest mass shooting in a school, Virginia Tech, was done with two handguns. There are more deaths by stabbing than by all rifles combined. Perception is the problem, not the reality.
1651 2018-02-20 20:23:14 last night I was so excited to use a new scent for my oil diffuser that I went to bed like 2 hours early just to sit by it longer so that's what how age 23 is treating me

1656 2018-02-20 20:22:36 I suppose the word Atheist was made up by someone to attack non believers. If there were to many non believers then there would hardly be any wars, except for wars over oil maybe.
1657 2018-02-20 20:21:57 Maybe they should have used a different word, you know, like "STOP". They used "KILL". 

Now why would anybody do that?
1658 2018-02-20 20:21:45 #AndThatsHowIGotThisScar
I was like 3yo. My dad was oiling the doors while my mum played the piano. Everytime she does this, she has the door closed so when my dad had to get new oil little Anna wanted to close the door (which was unhinged) for her and the door attacked me.
1659 2018-02-20 20:21:43 Actually wasn't it the Gaines variant adding the sum of the lopsided equilateral to the square of the left shoe size of the reader, with the remainder mailed to a Nigerian Prince for a share of his oil wealth
1660 2018-02-20 20:21:38 You can take your oil pipeline & put it where the sun doesn't shine. We do not want our coastal waters full of your oily sludge. Shame on you for hurting our wine producers.
1661 2018-02-20 20:21:38 I'm not dissing him as long as he offers 36,000 mile warranties and free oil changes for a year.
1662 2018-02-20 20:21:33 hmmmmm seems like agg. does the una brennan oil cleanser last a while? And is it good for eye make up?

1664 2018-02-20 20:21:21 It was called the Barcelona Declaration 1995, apparently. Now we are paying the true price of those oil guarantees!
1665 2018-02-20 20:21:19 @AMCHelps Hi, does your popcorn have dairy in it? I assume the optional buttery topping does. But what about the oil/salt/seasoning?
1666 2018-02-20 20:21:18 And they wonder why we need guns.
1667 2018-02-20 20:21:13 It's a nonsense and I said 2yrs ago not a drop of commercial oil would be found or flow

1671 2018-02-20 20:20:27 I miss the days when chemistry practicals involved making aspirin and dropping it on the floor and watching Jake and James attempt to make oil soap without adding oil
1672 2018-02-20 20:20:26 I guess the millions of NRA members are also Russian bots. Is this the new norm, to call those that support a different view point then your own a Russian bot?
1673 2018-02-20 20:20:19 I’m so done with having car troubles, but apparently my new car is done with having oil in it, so I guess that’s fine too.

1675 2018-02-20 20:20:10 Poor people,  victims of USA/CIA economic sabotage warfare. It's tragic. They're slowly rolling out the tactics they used in Nicaragua. Just thankful they didn't get the Iraq treatment as far as oil warfare goes.

1680 2018-02-20 20:19:41 Wow- @VisitNC @ncrealtors @vrbo You need to do all you can to fight this. This will literally kill your tourism industry. No one wants to look at rigs while they're on the beach. No one wants a home on a beach destroyed by an oil spill. Oil kills marine life people come to see.
1681 2018-02-20 20:19:32 Olive OIl is not to be used for Deep Frying. The researchers are not accepting that Sesame Oil, Peanut Oil and Coconut oil are the only best oils for deep frying at high temps. They will not affect the cholesterol levels but Canola oil gets the American Heart Association's Pick
1682 2018-02-20 20:19:26 @JeepCares Is the oil filter/cooler housing covered under the 5yr/100,000 warranty? 2014 JK. thanks
1683 2018-02-20 20:19:23 Oh god. Bubble dude is a chemist now? I hope you all know antioxidant and snake oil are synonyms.
1684 2018-02-20 20:19:22 So this is 2012. The video is 2013. Sanctions evidently didn't work on Iran in Syria. 
Sanctions are, however, taking their toll on Syrians. 
But "rebels" don't really care about that. 
Or about America stealing part of Syria & its oil?

1686 2018-02-20 20:19:00 Marika, I never made it to the Ionian islands! Kept to the Cyclades. Crete has some GREAT olive oil. Small producers.

1688 2018-02-20 20:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.

1691 2018-02-20 20:18:24 Alberta oil stocks = backward OK oil stocks since mid Nov. oil stocks in US are artfully low (at first KSA have almost nullified export to US, next Harvey, since November also Cushing transportation problems). All US draw from mid Nov=Cushing oil draw
1692 2018-02-20 20:18:14 Whether an asset/product rises to inf or falls to 0, I couldn't care less. I just care if the market offers me a good reward to risk opportunity.

1693 2018-02-20 20:18:11 That, my friend is exactly what the leaders did in 1995 in exchange for oil guarantees after the 1973 oil crisis scared the hell out of them! The agreed to allow Muslims in without let or hindrance or even integration!
1694 2018-02-20 20:18:06 @FatKidDeals can you find deals on cbd oil?
1695 2018-02-20 20:18:02 Crude oil annoys me. Too much too remember about fractional distillation and the different fuels it makes in a spECIFIc order.
1696 2018-02-20 20:17:51 Hearing all this rain just makes me wanna do a hot oil treatment to my hair so bad lol

1698 2018-02-20 20:17:38 Lol it's not even NATO the US is getting used by the EU until the EU has it's own really GAY army.  The IMF and pedophiles trying to take over Ukrainian oil supply like The Nazis for global war.
1699 2018-02-20 20:17:18 Conditioned my hair now I have this oil sitting in it  #FeelingGood
1700 2018-02-20 20:17:07 Venezuela was doing well until oil prices tanked. Their entire economy is geared to it - 95% of exports.
Their history is a long list of military dictatorships, coups and political interference from Russia and the USA. Natural disasters killed thousands which didn't help.
1701 2018-02-20 20:17:07 Textiles, paper, omega oil and cannibus plastic! A winner for a new industry. Jobs!
1702 2018-02-20 20:17:06 

Dawn, what the hell? 
Have you been at the diesel oil again?

Crunch the top.
Scoop-lick first wave of goo creme.
Munch the sides.
Finish the dregs.
Scoff the base.
Suck choc residue off fingers.

Repeat.

Sweet eggy nectar from the heavens
1703 2018-02-20 20:17:01 No more $ for Oil industry!!! There’s people starving around the globe and all these folks care About is more money. There’s technology to go full green already but these big Oil gigants blocking it for years
1704 2018-02-20 20:16:59 Do we need to chip in and buy @julieannsilver an AR so she can start killing us?
1705 2018-02-20 20:16:58 They'll nationalize the banks most likely, along with whatever industry is left limping along after all the capital investment has fled. Venezuela did this with their oil & other industries, it's par for the Marxist course.
1706 2018-02-20 20:16:43 I pay average $65 for a semi synthetic oil change. It takes no longer than 15 mins and I get Juice and a snack. I don’t have to get out of the car and they run a full diagnostic while topping off some fluids.
1707 2018-02-20 20:16:43 I also learned that every oil change ain’t the same. So yea
1708 2018-02-20 20:16:39 Yes, Venezuela is the end result of socialism. The country with the highest oil reserves in the world and was the most wealthy country in Latin America, took less than one decade of socialism to descend into eating zoo animals.
1709 2018-02-20 20:16:37 Hi Chelsea!  Check out our Organic Coconut Oil and Honey Throat Drops - available in GINGER + TURMERIC and LEMON - great for dry mouth and throat!  We are at the Fresh Ideas Pavilion, booth F32!  Come by for a sample! #expowest #newprodexpo #pureandbeneficial #naturalremedy
1710 2018-02-20 20:16:31 I didn’t get any from my second child, but Coconut oil. && congratulations
1711 2018-02-20 20:16:29 So why has someone not bought UKOG - spend £100 million pounds to by billions of pounds of oil
1712 2018-02-20 20:16:20 Oil filter taps, gear levers, con rods, rockers? Just thinking outside the box.
1713 2018-02-20 20:16:15 i never said trump was a good man, he is a snake oil salesman a conman, i have said that from the beginning, and if you think they did not know this about him you are mistaken, ask your self how and why someone like this was able to run in the first place?

1715 2018-02-20 20:16:03 why was the oil being crude 
1716 2018-02-20 20:16:00 Yes, Venezuela is the end result of socialism. The country with the highest oil reserves in the world and was the most wealthy country in Latin America, took less than one decade of socialism to descend into eating zoo animals.
1717 2018-02-20 20:15:59 Coconut oil & the sun
1718 2018-02-20 20:15:46 @ShepNewsTeam Shep you used to be a hard news staple.  You have now turned into a gossip reporter.  The best way to hurt Russia is to increase domestic oil and gas production which lowers the price of energy and squeezes Russia.  Trump is doing that..btw he just killed 100
1719 2018-02-20 20:15:40 No, I think that would be the oil guy. 
1720 2018-02-20 20:15:37 The FBI is reportedly investigating whether the NRA illegally funneled Russian money into American political campaigns. Look it up.
1721 2018-02-20 20:15:28 Maybe that's true. To be honest, I can't really look at photos of me full stop. I see some pictures of me from that time and wonder how on earth people didn't recoil and cross the road. It's horrible. More oil rig, not oil painting!
1722 2018-02-20 20:15:27 I remember being told never go to the dealership for an oil change cuz they gon tax. But it’s the cheapest there lol NTB, jiffy lube, good year, valvoline the ones taxing lls
1723 2018-02-20 20:15:18 Agreed but how else will Big IT, Big Oil, and every other Big Corp and industry distract people from their own best biological interests? Neil Postman was right - #AmusingOurselvesToDeath.
1724 2018-02-20 20:15:15 Una Brennan are cruelty free and I use their oil cleanser and have for a while, I love it. It’s vit c too so nice and brightening (im oily and dehydrated)
1725 2018-02-20 20:15:13 Make sure to make note of the date after each oil change. #ClassicCars #TipTuesday
1726 2018-02-20 20:15:08 Basements are quite rare in UK homes, you assuming arsehole.
1727 2018-02-20 20:15:08 Why not dig huge moats around schools and have huge pots of boiling oil on the ramparts?
That''s at least as sane as arming teachers and having them go around with concealed weapons
1728 2018-02-20 20:15:02 He already a rude Que! I like it. Make sure I teach him the Oil Recipe when he turn 6
1729 2018-02-20 20:14:44 AARP isn't a person! The second "A" stands for "association"? It's made of people but that's like saying Chipotle is a person. It's a business..

1731 2018-02-20 20:14:14 I agree with the AHA on no to butter. Coconut oil is alright tho. Better to just eat the whole coconut.
1732 2018-02-20 20:14:06 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
1733 2018-02-20 20:14:02 Increasing oil shipping capacity for higher profits is not compromise - the consumption of oil has to stop. Leaving the existing pipelines in operation is compromise enough.
1734 2018-02-20 20:13:55 Oh god that happened to me right at the beginning of winter until I went to get an oil change and got the tires topped up. Almost had a heart attack.
1735 2018-02-20 20:13:34 Progressivism is built on broken eggs like you, man. Nothing personal.
1736 2018-02-20 20:13:30 Alright. I go reach there tomorrow. That 1k for 10gb bundle still dey go?
1737 2018-02-20 20:13:19 I spilt some beard oil my ball sack pubes and I have a photo shoot in a week. What do I do?
1738 2018-02-20 20:12:57 Good point.
1739 2018-02-20 20:12:51 Birth control injection at 1:40.
Oil change at 2:30.
1740 2018-02-20 20:12:48 @DGodfatherMoody don't knock essential oils. They work!!! I rub oregano oil on the bottom of my feet to get rid of sickness. I diffuse lavender to help me sleep. I rub oils on my belly to heal an upset stomach. They DO work!!!! #goDoterra
1741 2018-02-20 20:12:41 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
1742 2018-02-20 20:12:34 state values include leaving ALL Parks alone to the animals and the tribes and visitors.  it is NOT for oil/gas use. If u can't embrace this then don't run.   Vote Dem. instead.
1743 2018-02-20 20:12:21 Of course not?... I think a lot of people just want to limit the sale of high-powered rifles like AR-15's, since people keep killing other people with them. It's not about you lol
1744 2018-02-20 20:12:20 You'd be very surprised how many DO shy away.

I've stood my ground unarmed against guns, once an M-14, and here I stand.

Bullies tend to back down when you don't take it.

It's intimidation more than anything else, they know the penalty for murdering the unarmed.
1745 2018-02-20 20:12:18 @UNOPS so we should not deceive the people of south sudan about peace if the oil production is going on
1746 2018-02-20 20:12:12 Apparently, you must be sacrificed for the greater good.
1747 2018-02-20 20:12:11 My hair.. do you know what goes into caring for my hair? Shampoo, Conditioner, Deep conditioner, Leave in conditioner, Hemp oil, Castor oil, coconut oil, Various combs and brushes, Gel, Hair sprays, and not to mention if i buy hair extensions or a wig #Expensive
1748 2018-02-20 20:11:59 How can Megan tell me she went to this guys house and he was like ill give ya a massage and then pulls out his 50 shades of grey oil merch I AM DEAD
1749 2018-02-20 20:11:56 Oil of Oregano, couple of drops under the tongue 3-4 times a day. Wash it down with water, it works.
1750 2018-02-20 20:11:48 @MittRomney are u going to fight Zinke to leave the Parks alone instead of shrinking for oil/gas?  If not, you are not the right candidate. Vote Wilson instead. Trump's backing is bad luck. People always lose. U r an old.fash'd Repub. but will u sell out to trump like Zinke?????
1751 2018-02-20 20:11:42 Ur military is normally in countries defending your intetests like oil
1752 2018-02-20 20:11:31 Many in this moment would say that only war can bring the oil prices and demand up. But if humanity will change the paradigm of evolution from “war factor” to “exploration of universe” we could really live happier then ever and use the oil too?

1754 2018-02-20 20:11:28 Is she wearing coat made of crude oil?
1755 2018-02-20 20:11:22 R u stupid! Canada has no oil crisis, They already solved energy problem. As whole world they developed Electric car and now it's growing up. So next 5 year they will not need oil as you think!
1756 2018-02-20 20:11:15 People don't seem to understand what terrorism is which is alarming considering we have been dealing with it for decades. The NRA is as much a "terrorist organization" as the ACLU or NAACP are the terrorist organizations.  Calling it one does not make it so.
1757 2018-02-20 20:11:10 I found that tea tree oil worked best for me
1758 2018-02-20 20:10:48 So that’s why your dog erdogan was buying oil from Isis.... stay out of other people’s countries

1761 2018-02-20 20:10:34 nah. it's never been serious, just unpleasant/itchy. some things are worse than others - i can usually do tofu/soy sauce, but soy milk or oil based things, edamame, or really intense soy protein fake meats are no bueno
1762 2018-02-20 20:10:28 I just put beard oil in my corgis butt fur. I told them they needed to look their best on account of it being Rihanna's birthday.

1771 2018-02-20 20:09:07 Oil painting of a back hand is my fav 
1772 2018-02-20 20:09:02 It is really easy to get surplus' you just increase taxes on the rich until you have a surplus. You can slash subsidies to Big Oil make a slim efficient military, go after off shore money with avengance. 

All of a sudden big surplus as well as free tuition Pharmacare Dentacare.
1773 2018-02-20 20:08:14 And will there be any wonder why DJT will get re-elected? Many of the posts, not just recently about the NRA, but since DJT was elected, lack any substance whatsoever. She has a DJT colluded hashtag? That’s so yesterday.

1783 2018-02-20 20:07:09 One of the things that makes me so mad about West Virginia is tht there are so many people who still think oil and gas can save our state's economy, why try to save something that is dying?When we can move on to clean energy.This will bring in more/new jobs& improve public health
1784 2018-02-20 20:07:05 saturated my hair and my entire body with coconut oil. spice me, then braai me.

1786 2018-02-20 20:06:55 But the carbon tax has had the exact opposite effect, oil producers have  been forced to innovate to remain competitive and they have and the renewable sector does not  need to innovate as they are getting subsidized so have become lazy.
1787 2018-02-20 20:06:55 You gotta start massaging them with @DelishCondish oil blend.

1800 2018-02-20 20:05:15 Agreed. 

I find it ironic that those who tend to bully with guns shy away from aggression so quickly.
1801 2018-02-20 20:05:14 Tell that to all the men and women that have died in vane defending America's interest in over seas oil.

1805 2018-02-20 20:05:02 You can oppose the actions of an organization and not its members. I'm an old person who often opposes  AARP, but that doesn't mean I oppose all its old people members. Many reports say NRA members don't agree with the NRA, but that doesn't mean those members oppose themselves.
1806 2018-02-20 20:04:55 Wow, you Trumpers are the biggest snowflakes ever! A vandalized billboard you are worried about, but not Trump spending our tax payer money, out of control, him discussing gun control,  and him funding planned parenthood! #TrumpCult
1807 2018-02-20 20:04:46 Its time the left realized the right will do whatever its paid to do. Big Solar now has the clout to bribe the GOP as Big Oil traditionally has. And so on.
1808 2018-02-20 20:04:41 You have synthetic or regular oil?
1809 2018-02-20 20:04:40 Hmmm, the USARA??
1810 2018-02-20 20:04:39 Also, it’s an oil, and what’s concerning to me is, when you get oil over a surface, it goes sticky and really hard to clean, well, wouldn’t the oil in my ecig act the same?, inside the lung?
1811 2018-02-20 20:04:31 I guess we approaching peak shale Oil...  I give it 2 years before we see drop on Shale Production at max.

1820 2018-02-20 20:03:27 do you have holy water or anointing oil with you. just start praying in tongues and doing them pentecostal shenanigans

1822 2018-02-20 20:03:17 "shall i kill all humans or drink a bit of oil?"
1823 2018-02-20 20:03:04 What if we consider safe sanitary landfills as a storage of resources for the future? What about landfill mining? It is already happening and will become economically viable once oil prices goes up. 
in parallel a strong reduction of waste. Incineration is not a solution
1824 2018-02-20 20:02:56 EVerytime I see ppl talking abt “castor oil” my brain automatically says “BEAVER OIL” I’m stressed

1835 2018-02-20 20:02:00 Carter is responsible for the good in our energy programs, created the Dept of Energy, and raised U.S. and global concerns regarding dependence on foriegn oil. He phased out natural gas/crude oil price controls & began the incentive programs for solar energy and home insulation.

1848 2018-02-20 20:00:23 One thing that's confusing is that organizations are actually made up of people. It's all they are.
1849 2018-02-20 20:00:22 You let Russian spies in. You let sanctioned Russian ships bearing sanctioned Russian oil & gas enter. Obama repossessed 2 compounds, enacted sanctions, & kicked 35 RU spies out. U are a total failure as president. Weak. Refusing to enact RU sanctions in direct violation of laws.
1850 2018-02-20 20:00:16 Had to put a cone on the chihuahua, to keep him from licking off the coconut oil on the pug’s ears.
1851 2018-02-20 20:00:16 Mr Bianchi says that the very fact Petro is being backed by oil is also somewhat questionable. Sure, there is a reference to the price of oil in the white paper concerning the official rate offered by exchanges.
1852 2018-02-20 20:00:16 Cody wakes up from a deadass sleep cause his grandma came in the room and said “Cody mans” and he LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD “24.99 for an oil change”

1861 2018-02-20 19:59:14 got my oil change yesterday now i need new back breaks  feels good to just have the money to get shit fixed though
1862 2018-02-20 19:59:07 Venezuela is fighting quadruple-digit inflation with crude oil production down 29 % in 2017 and is arguably defaulting on its debts & unless 1 really believes that this is only due to outside financial sanctions, there is no reason why this couldn’t happen with the Petro as well
1863 2018-02-20 19:59:01 I can send you the products I use for sure. If you’re cool using snail mucus on your body it’s probably the best lotion mixed with rose oil. Lol! The mask I use is just a Korean skincare volcanic mud mask but the oil and mucus seem to be the best for skin clarity and appearance
1864 2018-02-20 19:58:48 Well they didn’t kill you but they trapped you in holy oil so...

1887 2018-02-20 19:55:22 If you think that is the case then why do oil rich tyrannical countries like Venezuela and Iran shoot dead their citizen protestors? The Founders were a lot wiser than some supposed bad ass from Iowa afraid of guns.

1912 2018-02-20 19:52:46 It’s a bit bonkers. Diamorphine on prescription but not canabis oil? Misuse of one can cause death. Misuse of the other makes you eat the fridge.

1923 2018-02-20 19:51:39 +honestly after all these years of watching the environmental groups, there has been very minor campaign about oil exploration in the Arctic.

My mature side wanted to respond with “Oh ya....oil changes are dumb”
1949 2018-02-20 19:49:08 If done properly according to US environmental standards, it's very low risk to the environment, actually there is far less wildlife diversity in the Arctic than the tropics where most oil platforms are. However the Russians are the main drillers there

1957 2018-02-20 19:48:15 Again, it's not literally nothing, but Russia is a huge economic power, one that Trump desperately wants to open back up. Their oil stores rival the middle east, their billionaires buy tons of homes here.

1959 2018-02-20 19:48:10 @Oil_Guns_Merica hi will- I know this is a crazy request, but would love to chat sometime. I’m curious about your perspective on guns (not judging it— just want to better understand your POV) DM me if you are open to it. Cheers
1960 2018-02-20 19:48:02 Yeah I don’t have a problem with chiros who stick to just fixing back issues. But so many sell snake oil “supplements” for your “toxins” and/or claim they can fix ANY medical issue w/ chiro.
1961 2018-02-20 19:48:01 I don't think there is a wrong way to fry tofu. ;-) I use safflower oil to alleviate some saturated fat guilt (& not smoke up house), then use a dusting of organic corn meal/fine corn grits. I mix up the flavors but prefer tamari sauce to salt (+ cumin, garlic, cayenne powders)

1965 2018-02-20 19:47:44 Why no fried pickles???? They probably don’t use lard in their oil unless you’ve asked before. And I figured I could fill up on alcohol and carb my cravings...that’s why I chose Wednesday lol
1966 2018-02-20 19:47:42 I imagine they sell hemp oil, isn’t the same thing.

1968 2018-02-20 19:47:35 I love making plain popcorn and then adding truffle infused olive oil and sea salt it is addictive af

Added to NX Gold $NXN, Sold $BTE, added to Granite Oil $GXO (12% dividend at present valuation, and likely sustainable) and Epsilon Energy (#Natgas play with midstream operations) instead. Added to Fission #Uranium $FCU also.

1973 2018-02-20 19:46:43 Saddam actually received a UN award for having the best free healthcare program when he was getting $100,000s per capita income from oil to fuel his socialist programs while killing 100,000s of political rivals

1976 2018-02-20 19:46:17 Do you need an oil can?
1977 2018-02-20 19:45:45 And yet, yesterday when I said I contacted tons of Jill supporters asking why they could support a candidate who invested in big pharma, big oil & big tobacco, they went after me saying ALL mutual funds invest in those OR she didn't know. Bots still out there.
1978 2018-02-20 19:45:38 And will be asking for at least $4 Million. Oil don’t gave cap space
1979 2018-02-20 19:45:38 Hoooold on a second! Isn't modern synthetic (not high mileage synth) the healthiest option for old bikes?
I realize that modern gasoline has all sorts of sht in it, but is there any advantage of new-vintage oil?

1985 2018-02-20 19:44:58 Actually, reminds me I have used coconut oil on wood pieces I wanted to polish up to a shine. Maybe that would work as a sealant on pyro pieces? Let me know if you find anything you like 
1986 2018-02-20 19:44:57 You know it feels good outside when your coconut oil starts melting

That refuses to criticize officers who kill American citizens lawfully exercising their right to bear arms.

You defend gun manufacturers. Not the 2nd Amendment.

2010 2018-02-20 19:42:20 Well, it is a terrorist organization. It spreads fear and hate. You don't care about lives lost. You don't care when kids die. You make up lies and excuses about why guns never hurt anyone. And after every death, NRA finds ways to sell even more guns after lives are lost.
2011 2018-02-20 19:42:19 Oil supplies are increasing. New fields opened just last year. But hey,  if you're a unionist facts don't matter.
2012 2018-02-20 19:42:19 20 plus years as a coach  fuckin hell mate u must be lashing that oil of ulay on every night 
2013 2018-02-20 19:41:59 It is a mess. Alberta had a chance to correct course decades ago, and diversify its economy. Even now as the AB NDP and UCP bicker about who can service the oil industry best, they are missing opportunities to adapt to a new economy, see new opportunities. A shameful mess indeed.

2101 2018-02-20 19:30:46 Whip together 9 tsps bisque with 1 cup bake. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve over kale.
2102 2018-02-20 19:30:36 In a blanket low carb recommendation sure. But since the entire premise is "healthy" for both lf and lc that means aiming to remove industrial food and those oils scream industrial food. If healthy lf removes flour/sugar and healthy lc doesn't remove soybean oil that's stupid.
2103 2018-02-20 19:30:31 This is a perfect example of why we don’t want leftists in power.
2104 2018-02-20 19:30:28 The guys giving my car an oil change are vacuuming the inside and I’m honestly embarrassed bc my passenger seat has about 5 empty water bottles lol

2108 2018-02-20 19:29:58 As the Dow sinks 180 points the 10 year rises along with oil.
2109 2018-02-20 19:29:33  thanks for not just texting me sis ! Smashbox oil primer is my bae
2110 2018-02-20 19:29:29 Cannabis Oil?
2111 2018-02-20 19:29:16 My money is on @BBCScotlandNews ignoring this and broadcasting @RuthDavidsonMSP selling more snake oil instead
2112 2018-02-20 19:29:02 Where I live it's almost impossible to get a gun, only 4% gun ownership here but we have 3 TIMES as many gun deaths than America has.
2113 2018-02-20 19:28:59 Just one example of how the Turks have profited from the conflict, along with cheap oil from ISIS and cheap labour from refugees.
2114 2018-02-20 19:28:58 Nah mann just get some smoothing oil while it’s wet and let it be free!
2115 2018-02-20 19:28:54 There’s so much olbas oil in ma house n it’s not clearing my nose 
2116 2018-02-20 19:28:53 I can't wait to try making Castile bars soon! Just olive oil, lye, chamomile fragrance and flowers :D
2117 2018-02-20 19:28:50 Putin’s point of view would justify ANY DAMAGE to USA & world order if it gets him MORE $, MORE POWER. Troll farms & campaign $ were his best investment ever, why is this so lightly covered while intangibles like “wanting to destroy western power” is discussed ad infinitum? #OIL
2118 2018-02-20 19:28:35 good see there's still plenty of snake oil to go around though, sophistry isn't what it used to be.
2119 2018-02-20 19:28:33 You do no it's only tax we get from oil ???
2120 2018-02-20 19:28:32 there seems to be a problem with that definition.... German National SOCIALISM (i.e. NAZI) follow by Right-Wing.... socialism and right-wing are polar opposites.
2121 2018-02-20 19:28:02 Same, my face is super oily everybody use to tell me to avoid oils but jojoba oil N coconut oil save my life 4real. Adding more oils tricks your body into not producing more. Also diet is vital. Lovin ju alwayz.
2122 2018-02-20 19:28:00 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2123 2018-02-20 19:27:58 Enjoy your snake oil.

2125 2018-02-20 19:27:46 Post lunch Anthony, some great Wedding soup, and chicken cacciatore, and then a good discussion of deep water oil production.
2126 2018-02-20 19:27:34 Reformed armed robber and decorated international blogger @BrokermanDaniel calls it wrong! Says UKOG had 3 bottles of oil when in fact, they had none. Building peoples hopes up only to be dashed. Shame on you Dan, three bottles indeed!

2128 2018-02-20 19:27:14 I think you are one of the people who think cannabis oil has medicinal properties when all ALL testing shows it doesn’t. You probably think acupuncture is real too. My big clue is you supporting something with very dubious & limited evidence.
2129 2018-02-20 19:27:00 Hello kailyn .Im from Melbourne.
How r u?.People should keep their mouths shut about you and your kids right .I've seen u from the start .ur an amazing mum and don't let people tell u otherwise ..

As for Jenelle.she should look at her own backyard .She is no oil painting
2130 2018-02-20 19:26:55 Maybe it was the time I grew up in. But it seems the majority of the people born after 1980 actually expect life to be safe. My growing up it was a possibility of WWIII. Or a new ice age. Or losing Middle Eastern oil & the economy goes into a depression. We still lived our lives.
2131 2018-02-20 19:26:49 Great news...some guys will bark on this news sitting on their iPads with fatty bums all around them and they will try to be an expert or sense of humanity will come in them and they are same guys who will pour milk, oil on deity following the same culture..keep quiet and cherish
2132 2018-02-20 19:26:46 Only the cbd oil which doesn't help all complaints 
The thc oil is illegal pretty much everywhere
2133 2018-02-20 19:26:45 Oh and don't forget to fill the pools and ponds with concrete or used oil and burn every building on your property to the ground. Those people can't build or rebuild. Destroy railways, powerlines ect. Without whites it will never be repaired.
2134 2018-02-20 19:26:35 I've never heard of this person before, but I'm blocked?  I don't even have 100 followers?  Interesting.
2135 2018-02-20 19:26:35 made a coconut oil, brown sugar & honey face scrub and my skin been glowin’ ever since
2136 2018-02-20 19:26:32 Sounds like she is anti-gun, but pro-killing.  I will take the millions of pro-gun, anti-killing members of the @nra any day of the week.
2137 2018-02-20 19:26:23 course oil and gas HAHAHAHAHA
2138 2018-02-20 19:26:16 The rupee is worthless thanks to the connivance of your Saudi brethren to prop up the petro$ as benchmark against 3rd world slave currencies. As well as shipping all their oil energy to their masters when poor people in oil rich countries themselves cannot afford it/load shedding
2139 2018-02-20 19:26:03 My bitch ass just bought essential oil vapes 
2140 2018-02-20 19:25:47 Midnight Oil zou helemaal te gek zijn. 21 pilots mag ook. Black Stone Cherry. Of Muse. Of Oscar and the Wolf. Rhys Lewis, NF.
2141 2018-02-20 19:25:45 Unfortunately, those tech agencies may be as dangerous to us as oil barons.
2142 2018-02-20 19:25:44 The kind of day I'm having: I've been compulsively rubbing Stress Away essential oil on my wrists and huffing it every 23 seconds.
2143 2018-02-20 19:25:33 yes. Join the military. So you can go and kill poor people in brown countries at the behest of oil companies and the military industrial complex. That’s SOOOOO much better.

2149 2018-02-20 19:24:59 - low exports
- government corruption and mismanagement
- decade of relying on oil and neglecting other sectors in the economy
- war
- lack of foreign investment due to the government's policies and bad rep

2156 2018-02-20 19:23:48 No it’s not hard at all. Raise some taxes on oil and gas. There it’s done.
2157 2018-02-20 19:23:24 @JulieAnnSilver I hope people’s children aren’t with them when you give them what they have coming.
2158 2018-02-20 19:23:20 I want to try lavender body oil though 
2159 2018-02-20 19:23:20 Bare minerals is awsum bae. Also try using cocnut oil to remove the makeup afterwards usually its those makeup wipes that give you irritation/acne. All in all natural makeup/products way 2 go
2160 2018-02-20 19:23:09 For those who think white supremacy doesn’t exist or isn’t that bad: “before saturating Hose (African American man) with oil and applying the torch, they (A GROUP OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO CALLED THIS EVENT A BARBECUE) cut off his ears, fingers, and genitals, and skinned his face...”

2164 2018-02-20 19:22:57 Does anybody include those in "healthy low carb"? Added oil should naturally be scarce in "healthy low fat". I don't currently have access to the study at all.
2165 2018-02-20 19:22:52 Geez. Sounds like she needs some anger management. Not healthy.

2168 2018-02-20 19:22:22 and he does it without coconut oil
2169 2018-02-20 19:22:14 Tax payers subsidize oil and gas - solar would love to complete on even field but that's not current reality.
2170 2018-02-20 19:22:10 Conflating oil/gasoline with electricity only works if you assume EVs are right around the corner. They are not, despite what Prof Jaccard and Bloomberg New Energy Finance might argue.

2177 2018-02-20 19:21:25 Canadian oil is only a few hundred km away. But Quebec likes Arab oil more than  Canadian oil. Quebec likes Alberta $ but not Albertans.

2182 2018-02-20 19:20:37 I was shot at as a teenager. I didn’t know anything about guns or gun laws because of it. Now that I have read and listened to arguments on the topic, I know a lot more. So I fully agree with you.

2208 2018-02-20 19:18:31 No need to hurt animals these days. So easy to go vegan. The real challenge (if you really want a challenge) is vegan whole food, no oil or SOS free. Even McDonalds has standard vegan stuff... easy!
2209 2018-02-20 19:18:28 WHY does nobody include the Exxon $500 billion contract with Russia (that was estimated to yield oil in the $trillions &was cancelled in 2014 after Crimea sanctions) in the motive to have DT as president?

2226 2018-02-20 19:16:27 He is busy reframeing oil and gas workers as rapists and sexual harrassers who swoop in on small towns.
2227 2018-02-20 19:16:17 This oil change ended up taking almost four hours. Even the service coordinator can't quite explain why. I'm taking myself to lunch after this.

2233 2018-02-20 19:15:27 BitConnect was a scam. There are plenty of snake oil salesmen on YouTube and many of them shilled for BitConnect. It takes courage to stand up and let people know the truth about ponzi schemes. Heroes earn thumbs down from sheep about to be slaughtered.

2236 2018-02-20 19:15:11 Obviously you have no understanding of economics and what Socialism actually means.

2242 2018-02-20 19:14:42 Charles Koch has a long history of RW extremism & libertarianism.  I now see why Ryan gravitates to them, linked not only by oil but ideology.  Their greed is an insatiable, bottomless black hole.
2243 2018-02-20 19:14:35 So @scotiabank says oil pipeline costs Cdn economy $10.7B this year.  That's a lot of jobs & taxes given to Donald Trump! #cdnpoli

2254 2018-02-20 19:13:10 You tried mixing cononut oil with the palmers stretch mark lotion and rubbing yourself down twice a day? I was huge and didn’t get any. Get the coconut oil from bed bath & beyond
2255 2018-02-20 19:13:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2256 2018-02-20 19:13:03 Got done taking a shower and shampooing my hair now i got egg and olive oil on my hair got to leave it for a few minutes
2257 2018-02-20 19:13:02 Who knows why he hasn’t applied sanctions? He has armed Poland, Ukraine & killing Russians in Syria. These moves make Russia spend $$ . Also US oil production is hurting Russia’s finances. We’re selling to their customers cutting intoRussia’s profits.
2258 2018-02-20 19:12:58 
are these waterbased? or oil based?
2259 2018-02-20 19:12:54 We've never said we want to stop all carbon emissions tomorrow.
We're saying the Huntly coal & gas generation should have been phased out this year as originally planned, and oil exploration should stop now. A rapid phase out of fossil fuels is required worldwide.

2260 2018-02-20 19:12:51 Or dynamite & fertilizer with a little fuel oil!
2261 2018-02-20 19:12:48 Agreed. Oil is a commodity. Products derived from oil can be acquired from the US. They have multiple US border crossings, rail access and a major port. There's nothing AB provides they cant get elsewhere.
2262 2018-02-20 19:12:46 Ckuehn76Kuehn Hi Christopher, Our Member's Mark peanut butter does contain palm oil.
2263 2018-02-20 19:12:41 the one benefit from dosing with an infused grapeseed oil tincture that no one really talks about is how gosh darn regular it'll make you 
2264 2018-02-20 19:12:37 1/2 
US stock market is on track, shunning away the noise in early Feb. All ranges of yields have been up since Sep. last year. Oil price is strong. Inflation is coming. Run ahead of inflation.

2272 2018-02-20 19:11:52 I hate how long it takes to get my oil changed.
2273 2018-02-20 19:11:51 My best friend just took a class and is now doing them, so I’d get them done for nothing or pretty cheap, but yeah upkeep is what’s turning me away, and also that I can’t use my oil makeup remover and or rub my eyes 
2274 2018-02-20 19:11:47 Slow Tuesday. Getting an oil change and tire rotation. So far, 40 minutes in.

2278 2018-02-20 19:11:31 Bleeech! - that face with it's smug-stupid expression, that voice, that coagulated oil spill that he calls a hairstyle - it all makes me 
2279 2018-02-20 19:11:27 Electrification of heating is also an option in some places - over 20 year timelines, it may make sense to replace end-of-life boilers with air source heat pumps. (I got one last year - replacing oil, but still - the economics stack up well, plus less worry about CO poisoning).

2286 2018-02-20 19:10:34 Whenever I get my oil changed, the guy shows me the dip stick with the oil, and I just nod my head and act cool about it like I understand what's going on.
2287 2018-02-20 19:10:30 A vile club with a vile manager, vile fans and vile oil money. That’s what last night looked like. You’ve heard enough, why don’t you & the other fan enjoy your vile title.
2288 2018-02-20 19:10:25 Steven.  Trumps not undermining the country in referencing the Russians. He’s promoting lots of oil production which should hurt Putin.  Pundits & reporters are helping to undermine America with their ant-Trump bias.   Just look at your headlines it’s disgusting & hurtful
2289 2018-02-20 19:10:19 All oil, well framed and he tucked the original photo from the 60s in the frame of each painting. It's kind of sweet. Maybe I'll grow to appreciate them...

2298 2018-02-20 19:09:17 I think this gets better the more oily the bread is. There's a Greek restaurant close to where my parents live that deep fries small flat breads, adds garlic oil and serves it with spicy garlic creme /tzatziki

2303 2018-02-20 19:08:48 I'll clarify:

There's already sanctions in place on certain sectors, and very specific persons, but stops short of specifically hitting oil/gas, which was what I was attempting to reference.

I don't quite have the degree or bonafides to talk in depth about effects (cont)
2304 2018-02-20 19:08:46 Sid fixed my headlights, did my oil change and now makin me breakfast in bed

2306 2018-02-20 19:08:06 US forces and @SenJohnMcCain's good terrorists are occupying Syria's oil and gas fields. The fields belong to Syrian people and not to us or @georgesoros. We are not good guys on this one. Truly shameful. @CNN @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff #Globalism

2329 2018-02-20 19:05:23 The oil helps. But Norway spends a tiny percentage of it. Similarly, many countries that have substantial oil reserves have not ended up where Norway is. It's the Nordic Model, which works in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Island as well (no oil!) that is the difference

Building power stations are part of infrastructure, I don't see a problem with building a renewable power station.

2344 2018-02-20 19:02:49 I've had acne forever it feels, and the only thing that helped me is getting a retinal/tretintoin cream from a derm! It takes a while to see a diff but it definitely worked for me! (I second whoever said jojoba oil) it's good to use at night bc the prescription causes drying!

2382 2018-02-20 18:59:02 Oil is more durable. A freshly oiled road is as smooth as a paved road. Practices change with environmental concerns.
2383 2018-02-20 18:59:01 Deep thoughts by Randy, #OOTT: From experience and observation,  "The average corporate oil & gas employee who decides that "anyone can trade oil and gas" & opens his/her own account to prove it, will lose $50,000 of personal money before seeking training & "try to make it back".

2385 2018-02-20 18:58:53 I'm more afraid of Spence!! But, yes, we do need to dirty our hands and work for change. Real change. No more corporations & banks & oil&gas & NRA and big pharma calling the shots. 
2386 2018-02-20 18:58:47 Buy Big Oil out, prune from the top, convert to B Corporations.
2387 2018-02-20 18:58:47 @Naveen_Odisha @otvnews There is counterfeit medicines, ghee, creams, engine oil, tobacco,liquor circulating in odisha. Police has to be vigilant. Culprits should be given death sentence. Immediate action needed
2388 2018-02-20 18:58:42 I have an entire walk-in closet full of large format oil paintings of Mexico. Probably 17 or 18 in total.

2401 2018-02-20 18:56:01 When I lived in the Florida panhandle a little while back, they sent water trucks out on occasion to wet the back roads down with water.

It kept the sand down. Sounds similar except I prefer the water to oil

2476 2018-02-20 18:45:49 True for overall averages, but
1. Plants that invest in CCS are likely to run more
2. If CCS is for EOR, CO2 needs for oil recovery will influence operation.

2499 2018-02-20 18:42:47 I am terrified of eyelash curlers.  I just use like 6 coats of mascara LOL. Coconut oil is great for removing makeup, but you might want to set your eyes with powder to keep things in place during the day.

2511 2018-02-20 18:41:03 The struggle in Flint been way too much about the governor and not enough about DuPont, General Motors, Sherwin Williams, Standard Oil. These are the people who poisoned us all, and directly interfered with/buried science that told the truth. It’s been a whole century
2512 2018-02-20 18:40:57 Have you heard that saying fight fire with fire not true you fight fire with water it really depends on what type of fire it is if it’s an oil fire or some type of material fire you have to know what type of substance will put the fire out
2513 2018-02-20 18:40:49 Obama's Economic Warfare was the real damage. Cutting oil down, strangling the Rusky financially, crushing Venezuela at the same time. Come on. The Economic warfare for the dollar, central banks, elite - not the people.
2514 2018-02-20 18:40:48 That's what you've got? When did we kill these Russians? The airstrike last April didn't even hurt a single Russian. And Russia isn't even in our top 5 for imports of oil. Oh, he has been TOUGH on NOT holding them accountable or placing sanctions on them, so there is that.
2515 2018-02-20 18:40:39 I made this pizza with Filet Mignon and artichoke hearts over Mozzarella and called it 'Buffalo Frisbee' because it also has Zaatar and olive oil on gluten-free crust.
2516 2018-02-20 18:40:29 I imagine it was because its results could have triggered a Scottish breakaway. However, you should read the long-term concerns in the report about a collapse in the oil price. Prescient or what!

2518 2018-02-20 18:40:25 Good to know! What would you recommend for a skinthusiast like myself looking for Vit C, hyaluronic acid & possibly niacinamide in serum or oil? So glad you  me...I'm thoroughly obsessed with you! Haha

2524 2018-02-20 18:39:01 But you know  I am  that kind who takes my chances and   surprisingly  people loved it  and  started spreading word of mouth.  This  encouraged  me to introduce  much  more others like braid sprays,  hot oil   treatments, shampoo, scalp   therapy, skin moisturizer and  many more.
2525 2018-02-20 18:38:59 Shannon have you had a good Oil Down yet? The same applies lol.
2526 2018-02-20 18:38:53 @EconguyRosie that's because of higher taxes higher loonie low price for our oil also alberta getting 0.00 for nat gas think about that price
2527 2018-02-20 18:38:18 @JeffMerkley I for one, and I know I speak for a lot of Americans when I say; We are tired of high gas prices at the pump and being dependent on foreign oil! How do you think the oil/natural gas was extracted? Just so you have the power to object to what America needs!?!?!

2537 2018-02-20 18:37:13 After this photo was taken, the robot had an oil leakage
2538 2018-02-20 18:36:56 I took my car in for an oil change yesterday and now they’re replacing the front axel. If this wasn’t all covered under warranty I’d definitely say this is a scam.
2539 2018-02-20 18:36:51 It would seem we are definitely headed Mozambique lite route debtwise or more like Ghana next stop borrowing against future oil revenues
2540 2018-02-20 18:36:46 I read that high heat changes the chemical structure of olive oil making it unhealthy.
2541 2018-02-20 18:36:46 Oil money
2542 2018-02-20 18:36:38 Hey can you also mention Saudi Arabian influence as well? Big oil for both Russia and S.A. have made huge impacts in prior elections as well. Just sayin'.....
2543 2018-02-20 18:36:35 Hmm Europe is probably the best-placed region of the world for dealing with 2020. Crude oil production in North Sea, WAF and Med has plenty of low sulfur grades, and most European refiners happy to make higher margin fuels. I wouldn't listen to #Rosneft for your main source

2561 2018-02-20 18:34:20 I need a distraction from the stress today. Getting an oil change. If there are any #TMITuesday questions, ask one and I’ll ask one back~

2563 2018-02-20 18:33:34 The truth is lost between a bottle of oil and a intro class

You're such a shameless
#FA
2571 2018-02-20 18:31:34 Coconut oil, modified starch, and flavourings. The company is Greek and has lots of varieties - mozzarella, cheddar etc. A whole new world and oh next time we cook together I can have it on roasted aubergines or something!
2572 2018-02-20 18:31:19 it's the first sovereign crypto, look out for massive appreciation because the backing is both by state and by commodity and remember price stability of oil (while not stellar) is actively managed via market forces discounting all headwinds
2573 2018-02-20 18:31:11 I'm talking "fat grandparents having sex while all lubed up in baby oil" levels of disgust
2574 2018-02-20 18:31:11 And the FA, as expected are a bunch of blind, oil money-swimming buffoons who aren’t taking any action against them. Jose would’ve been sentenced to death had he done it. But the FA guys and the media loves the freakin’ baldie, so cant help it now.
2575 2018-02-20 18:31:10 Alaskans own 13,853 shares of ENERGEN CORP, worth $754,157. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

Check the clarity of the oil, should look new & not black.

2597 2018-02-20 18:27:40 Get me the fuck off this oil rig
2598 2018-02-20 18:27:39 I've finished reading it. 18 pages, most of which focussed on the oil issue. I can understand why you were miffed though. However, we are where we are.
2599 2018-02-20 18:27:34 I don’t believe that anyone with a conscious would  be against some type of buy back program. Change isn’t easy, but it’s got to happen. If we can give oil companies billions in tax cuts, we can find a way to get this done. It may very well be our own lives we save.
2600 2018-02-20 18:27:15 Power is now travelling over the Maritime link, bringing power from NS into NL. It will save NL Hydro $50,000 a day compared with generating that power using oil at Holyrood #cbcnl

2610 2018-02-20 18:26:29 Actually, no, it's not right because water doesn't go in a deep fryer oil does, you fuckin fooligan
2611 2018-02-20 18:26:26 You know what’s the best? Reading oil and gas regulations. I’m just kidding. It’s not the best.
2612 2018-02-20 18:26:21 Colonized ctries wouldn't knw abt certain resources like oil, let alone have a use for them if it weren't for whites. Africa  is still VERY rich in nat. resources, what got stolen is nothing in comparison. All independent nations, very poor governing. Just easier to blame whites?

2616 2018-02-20 18:25:44 Oil and gas extraction produces significant volumes of wastewater. This "Produced Water" is the subject of a panel discussion tomorrow at 9 AM in SU 408 for Research Week. If you can't attend in person, watch live on @OStateTV
2617 2018-02-20 18:25:36 Look, like it or not, you are part of the U.K. This means that oil revenue belongs to us all, to be shared throughout the U.K. You can but hypothesise about how it may have impacted on Scotland, so there is no point going on about it.
2618 2018-02-20 18:25:31 Used to all the time.  Thank you CBD Oil. Now they are a rare event.  After 30+ years, big sigh of relief.

2639 2018-02-20 18:22:49 Here’s the relevant point. City are buying the best players and winning trophies with no academy players on the team. The stadium is called the Etihad ffs. There’s nothing Manchester about them, and the fans pretend they’re proud. It’s ALL bought with oil money

2650 2018-02-20 18:21:30 Two of his first platforms in the Gov race are to ban all oil drillling, fracking and exploration in the state. In addition to banning assault weapons. He was progressive before progressive was in the lexicon of American politics.

2655 2018-02-20 18:21:02 Oil for example is a resource that anaesthetises thoughts,  blurs vision and corrupts.
2656 2018-02-20 18:20:47 All good but the market is keen - I know I am - to know what NTOG's little share of all of this cash flow into US oil sector has been Matt! The uncertainty is a killer to serious investment and not so good for hard pressed PIs who have been loyal since 2009... :)
2657 2018-02-20 18:20:34 why does jojoba oil smell like bacon flavoured crisps

2661 2018-02-20 18:20:16 Oil and gas 
2662 2018-02-20 18:20:12 Olive oil is truly a powerhouse when it comes to hair, skin and beauty applications:
2663 2018-02-20 18:19:41 How is Norway doing or China with Socialism ? Borrowing too much money can happen to any country, not just a socialist country. That's why Venezuela is screwed, mostly because of the price of oil, which US & Saudi purposefully manipulated to hurt Venezuela, Russia, Iran....
2664 2018-02-20 18:19:38 So why are your BIG OIL FRIENDS KEEP RAISING GAS PRICES. WHAT TAX BREAK NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM
2665 2018-02-20 18:19:30 Oh, Joe got his pound of flesh out of me that day. 4 oil changes, 3 trips to PepBoys, 2 brake jobs, & 1 swept garage while letting me twist in the wind.
2666 2018-02-20 18:19:24 For samsu oil? Na 1k ee
2667 2018-02-20 18:19:17 It's his father in law, German Khan,who once described the Godfather films as a "manual for life" and who's tied to Alfa Bank and Rosneft Oil that you want to pay attention to
2668 2018-02-20 18:19:11 The engine actually works without any battery.  Any Size May be Made. Works forever no, Oil necessary
The engine cannot patent Weapons May,
2669 2018-02-20 18:19:08 I’m the worst car owner. I wash it one a year, forget oil changes and to put gas, and fail to read my dashboards lights. 
2670 2018-02-20 18:19:06 When you're out of salt, pepper, herbs, spices, cooking oil, tea, coffee, toilet roll, washing up liquid, powder, shampoo, tampons, painkillers & phone credit, when your boots leak, your coat & duvet are too thin, your towels & sheets threadbare and your hot water bottle burst...
2671 2018-02-20 18:18:58 That entire statement is confusing.  It’s like a man saying he’ll quit drinking to save his liver but will drink more because it tastes good. Errrrrmm I don’t see increased production of oil will reduce Emmissions. Oh right, they’re addressing  a 3rd World nation yes!??  Sigh!
2672 2018-02-20 18:18:57 Alaska with its socialist oil fund for residents. Republicans would love it! And deny it is socialist.
2673 2018-02-20 18:18:56 Nah mate.. love the football you boys play but not a fan of dirty oil money..
2674 2018-02-20 18:18:56 Soot includes fine black particles, chiefly compose of carbon, produced by incomplete combustion of coal, oil, or other fuels. #StopTheSoot
2675 2018-02-20 18:18:39 Peppermint oil in a diffuser helps ease cooking smells and it’s very inexpensive
2676 2018-02-20 18:18:38 Coconut oil girl!
2677 2018-02-20 18:18:32 let the oil cool down and keep the jug and pour it back in! It is easier to dispose of it that way!
2678 2018-02-20 18:18:30 You gotta rub coconut oil on your a cups every night to get them to grow.
2679 2018-02-20 18:18:20 Taking Bentley to get an oil change in a min
2680 2018-02-20 18:18:20 In order to fry something, firstly you need some oil.
2681 2018-02-20 18:18:12 Sadly taxes and co2 mitigation will do little for the climate. We are being sold snake oil.
2682 2018-02-20 18:17:59 Uv 3 who’s got tanning oil
2683 2018-02-20 18:17:57 Someone please tell me how long does a oil change normally take I’m going on two hours
2684 2018-02-20 18:17:55 Idiot even add Goya oil 
2685 2018-02-20 18:17:39 Anyone how any thoughts on castor oil making your lashes and brows become fuller?
2686 2018-02-20 18:17:37 LOL. If Islamic Regime  was capable of managing oil and gas resources they wouldn't have ruined them in #Iran. My guess is a lot of Syrian oil and gas revenue is going to go "missing".
2687 2018-02-20 18:17:33 @LovingVincent, It's a spectacular movie and it's the life of #VincentVanGogh. It's world's first full painted film. It's drawn by 125 professional artists & they drew 853 different oil paintings shots. The Movie length is 01:34 minutes and 12frames/second. Total 65,000 frames.
2688 2018-02-20 18:17:18 Dignified mobility is being able to move about one's day in a safe, comfortable and respectful manner, be that by walking, riding something on wheels or a vehicle. Being timely and thrifty is great. Dodging oil tankers and trucks on unplowed paths? Not to like.
2689 2018-02-20 18:17:17 I like mixing orange oil and vanilla as a natural alternative. Okay, so I smell like a Dreamsicle but....
2690 2018-02-20 18:17:10 Have 2 tickets to tonights Oil/Bruins game for sale.
217/8/5&6
Tickets are $129/each, will sell pair for $175.
2691 2018-02-20 18:17:03 Right now over 150 billion dollars worth of oil projects have been stopped.  They say they are protecting the environment but we already had strict government regulations in place. In Alberta  we have long line ups at the food bank. Anyone who disagrees with him are called Nazis.
2692 2018-02-20 18:16:53 Natural ORGANIC peppermint oil helps relieve headaches and migraines
2693 2018-02-20 18:16:47 Changing your oil, checking your tires and doing other car maintenance tasks today could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in the long run.
2694 2018-02-20 18:16:44 Sure, if it also doesn't care about protecting trade-exposed industries. Again, back to the carbon levy and OBAs. Oh, wait: "...oil sands output will not grow." Ah, there we go.
2695 2018-02-20 18:16:41 Changing your oil, checking your tires and doing other car maintenance tasks today could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in the long run.
2696 2018-02-20 18:16:39 Changing your oil, checking your tires and doing other car maintenance tasks today could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in the long run.
2697 2018-02-20 18:16:38 Changing your oil, checking your tires and doing other car maintenance tasks today could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in the long run.
2698 2018-02-20 18:16:37 Changing your oil, checking your tires and doing other car maintenance tasks today could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in the long run.
2699 2018-02-20 18:16:36 glanced thru white paper: backing Petro by Orinoco oil is nominal. not enforceable.

2701 2018-02-20 18:16:03 When you see that men have been wounded by the law, then it is time to pour in the Gospel oil.~Puritan Samuel Bolton
2702 2018-02-20 18:16:01 I was wearing shorts, tinkering with my motorcycle, gave its quick ride on the drive way, hit some oil, it slid out from under me, and I laid the hot exhaust pipe down on my exposed calf.  #AndThatsHowIGotThisScar
2703 2018-02-20 18:15:59 It's the same recipe that crushed Venezuela. Low oil prices hurt revenue and economy of oil producing nation, further exacerbated by sanctions that strangle GDP. Dictator then prints money to solve the problem leading to inflation.
2704 2018-02-20 18:15:55 rosehip oil does wonders
2705 2018-02-20 18:15:54 Honest question for those demanding #GunControlNow , do you blame the car, alcohol or the drunk person driving if they plowed into a crowd and kill others? Think about that before you answer. My money says you blame the person.
2706 2018-02-20 18:15:53 ok so what you’re tellin me is the jojoba oil should not b spread on the surface of my entire face unless I mix it 50/50 with the carrier oil.. or option b. is to go with a premade mix of the two
2707 2018-02-20 18:15:38 To be fair it would be a local derby of huge magnitude if it wasn't for oil money as they would be in the same division
2708 2018-02-20 18:15:36 Coming Real Soon Bro!!! Gotta get the oil changed
2709 2018-02-20 18:15:13 That delicious smell of garlic, olive oil, onions and cod...

2711 2018-02-20 18:14:59 I love tea tree oil

2715 2018-02-20 18:14:28 @TheBodyShopUK hello when are you going to stop using palm oil in your products even sustainable palm oil?
2716 2018-02-20 18:14:22 Looking to try #Cannabis cooking? @HealthyPharms has 500mg THC olive oil 10% off all this week. Try a vinaigrette or maybe olive oil cake! #MMJ #medicalmarijuana #Massachusetts
2717 2018-02-20 18:14:13 Currently, doing WNET freelance work, creating a tour announcement poster, cooking lunch for bf, tweeting about it all... I really need more hands. I'm glad Snake Oil band practice was called off today...

2719 2018-02-20 18:13:57 Cheapest way to watch the Olympics: pay $80 for an oil change and bum around the dealerships waiting area, while enjoying all the free Keurig coffee as well
2720 2018-02-20 18:13:46 @SoCalTelevision #Traffic #Alert > !! sigalert !! the ramp to the 118 west is closed because of an oil spill. i... #FOLLOW #SoCalTelevision
2721 2018-02-20 18:13:43 I believe they are running/ran out of money, have death spiral finance to convert, have not found oil....etc etc I could go on, You keep your rose colooured spectacles on and I will live in the real world.
2722 2018-02-20 18:13:30 Is Jaccard not aware of the carbon levy/OBAs regs, as well as the Carbon Competitiveness Incentives? The point is to reduce carbon-intensity per barrel so that total oil sands emissions DON'T rise as production increases.
2723 2018-02-20 18:13:30 Where I do agree is that there were no plans for reconstruction after Saddam was toppled, + there wouldn't be cos it was not in USA's interests (+ to a lesser extent UK et al), their main motives being oil + armaments, exploitation of other Iraqi resources etc
2724 2018-02-20 18:13:16 Shit be awkward as fuck! Like daym I'm tryna get some coconut oil and have a good day but everyone wanna stare
2725 2018-02-20 18:13:12 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.

2727 2018-02-20 18:13:11 Lol, I don't want my roommate to burn me with hot oil like she burns all the food she cooks.,     
2728 2018-02-20 18:13:09 found some oil in Dari's room. I think I'll gift it to L.

2731 2018-02-20 18:12:05 why is PAPER more expensive than OIL PASTELS
2732 2018-02-20 18:11:55 NO Hazard , Giroud , Willian 
2733 2018-02-20 18:11:49 Oh yes it feels magical out and tomorrow will be even nicer. Whipping out my corporate heaux fits and making sure my body is glistening in bronzer and baby oil.
2734 2018-02-20 18:11:43 DPR should go to Osun state, independent oil marketers are still selling beyond #145 including the MRS in osogbo
2735 2018-02-20 18:11:39 Que va a pagar!!! Y encima , la petrolera "Oil", ya se está endeudado de nuevo.
2736 2018-02-20 18:11:34 Just done the Oil tank wiggle with a large stick - at this rate of consumption and allowing for the #BeastFromTheEast - the radiators will frost over in seven weeks.
2737 2018-02-20 18:11:33 First few days I was using nipple cream but now I tend to forget every time. I just rub coconut oil on them everytime I shower
2738 2018-02-20 18:11:29 If you look at the facts, which the drive-by media refuses to do, you see that Trump has been SO MUCH TOUGHER on Russia than Obama was. We just killed dozens of Russians in a US-backed airstrike on Syria and have boosted our oil & gas production, which hurts Russia economically!
2739 2018-02-20 18:11:21 I was commenting on her not speaking to Trump. This isn’t about Obama. Let’s make gun reform work now and save the children. Let’s have students be able to study without worrying about being shot. Stay on the message. #GunContolNow
2740 2018-02-20 18:11:17 People pray for cake. Then when God gives them batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen
2741 2018-02-20 18:11:16 Not usually a fan of any vegetable, but stuff it with old fryer oil? !! Sounds like a good time!!
2742 2018-02-20 18:11:05 I’m stuck on oil ocean zone in sonic mania. The 2nd act boss battles

2747 2018-02-20 18:10:14 I think it was just vegetable oil.
2748 2018-02-20 18:10:05 Hair tip for today.
1.Oil your ends to stop them from breaking. This will help cut down friction against your clothes and when wearing hats. #naturalhairtips
2749 2018-02-20 18:10:02 Not bothering with the match tonight. I need to oil my beard then attend a Pub Quiz which offers a free half time buffet. Respect to the fans who plan on enduring it... #SAFC 
2750 2018-02-20 18:10:00 I smell like grease...honestly machine oil is like. my aroma
2751 2018-02-20 18:09:59 @andpizza WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE GARLIC OIL? How can I live now???
2752 2018-02-20 18:09:39 #MrPresident with massive deregulation when might we start to see oil production platforms in the gulf to start producing more oil and exporting to global markets? Thanking you in advance, if you care to reply Sir 
2753 2018-02-20 18:09:31 $ZN big open prospectus for offering, the company seems to know nothing about anything, bot even sure if the oil they found is useable or if they can even get it to the surface, what a sham!!!!
2754 2018-02-20 18:09:11 i nevet want to see oil cops beat little girls who went right back and faced those who tried to take the warriors heart no way
2755 2018-02-20 18:09:04 @talkSPORT @talkSPORTDrive @DGoughie big goose bumps listening to Chelsea V Barca commentary epic  #UCL #CHE
2756 2018-02-20 18:09:02 No mention about the palm oil and forests?
2757 2018-02-20 18:08:51 I've seen how both parties are owned by the same banks, oil companies, defense contractors, & weapons manufacturers so I can't unsee that, I agree with Rand Paul on his anti-war stances but most Republicans are for economic policies that redistribute worker earned profits up
2758 2018-02-20 18:08:33 Physio booked, Oil change booked, Cleaning the house. Cannot wait to be with all my best friends for the weekend, getting drunk, cooking food and most of all Celebrating Zoe's 20th. Weekend come faster 
2759 2018-02-20 18:08:27 Obama blocked a joint Exxon-Russia oil exploration venture in the Arctic as well. Trump put Exxon CEO and named 'friend of Russia' Rex Tillerson as head of the Department of State.
2760 2018-02-20 18:08:18 Oil would definitely destroy this present world without compliance and control. Alternative forms of energy must be boosted for obvious reasons. QUEEN
2761 2018-02-20 18:08:10 Going 7000 miles between oil changes is just part of smart budgeting... duh
2762 2018-02-20 18:08:01 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.

2764 2018-02-20 18:07:50 USA and Canada sees the strongest competitors and uses all shady ways to move them from the gold. What ever it is black gold ( oil ), sport gold, or real gold.
2765 2018-02-20 18:07:39 Wrong, report is vital to your ‚deficit remarks‘. Oil revenues of the last 30+ yrs would’ve made Scotland as wealthy as other EU oil countries. An example of how Scotland has been dealt with bu UKG. #scotref
2766 2018-02-20 18:07:26 2 cloves of garlic sliced and stuffed into the eye round. Covered the outside with extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt, pepper, and onion powder. Cooked on indirect heat on my kettle with 2 chunks of plum wood until it read about 130*. No sear since it was for sandwiches.
2767 2018-02-20 18:07:22 19:10 How tarry ye shall not labour from thee: after the oil without young things shall be of a snare: now when I shall have gods for meat offering, and in envy of their fathers: 7:19 Because of mine heart is as stubble; 9:14 If thou send me, and speak right unto death.
2768 2018-02-20 18:07:12 Not a bad thing. Heck, ban all semi-autos, let ppl use regular shotguns for self defense, rifles for hunting, and you've already helped. Shooters would find it harder to kill 17 ppl in 3 mins, it'd give ppl a chance to rush them or run away.

Anti-woman, anti-gun reform, pro wall st & big oil endorsements, pro Russia... what in the actual hell is progressive???
2777 2018-02-20 18:06:26 May Her Oil Rest In Peace
2778 2018-02-20 18:06:18 Trump can't impose tge sanctions. He overturned the ban of drilling in the Arctic and Russia and it's oil company Rosneft want to drill. The dossier says Trump owns 19% of Rosneft as a reward for colluding with Russia......

Quiénes son  los guiseros?
2783 2018-02-20 18:05:43 So tell me why petrol prices are high when the crude oil in international market is low..PM when in opposition was saying the petrol price is too high for common man..now what happen
2784 2018-02-20 18:05:43 We're back to Tuesday rains just to make oil mill messy for Wednesday market 
2785 2018-02-20 18:05:41 Did he explain to the wonders of socialism? How an oil rich country runs out of gasoline and food? How the socialists destroyed the economy and the people voted for exactly that? Take by government force from those producing wealth and redistribute to parasites.
2786 2018-02-20 18:05:36 @ClimateHome Hi, are you going to loose any words on the new BP ENERGY OUTLOOK 2018??? Based on that report, Oil is the future....
2787 2018-02-20 18:05:26 Just read news article on Huufpost that Mr.President was against environmental protection I don't believe it. That his youngest son would have to grow up in a land of pollution and oil spills

2791 2018-02-20 18:04:45 getting my oil changed is so annoying, but i enjoy looking at the mechanics
2792 2018-02-20 18:04:45 didn’t even think of tea tree oil thank you!!
2793 2018-02-20 18:04:37 This is about how much oil is in the foundations. Smaller oil stain the better for oily skin
2794 2018-02-20 18:04:23 First lightly boiled, then add olive oil with a little Montreal steak seasoning,
(just pepper & salt) 
then a few minutes low broiled. Enjoy.
2795 2018-02-20 18:04:09 Oh i did. No change. Helps when u got oil money. Enjoy the smidgen of relevance 
2796 2018-02-20 18:03:55 i use ponds dry face cream(walmart) and it’s the best, you can also try vitamin e oil (trader joe’s) if your skin is extra dry
2797 2018-02-20 18:03:55 The last time I went to great clips I got an oil change- Matt Sylvester
2798 2018-02-20 18:03:52 Coconut oil makes my face soft but breaks me out 
2799 2018-02-20 18:03:48 Yes - I am doing red meat tonight but  then my protein is over! It’s a hard balance! I need a lot of coconut oil. I’m doing fat bombs but need to do without peanut butter next time so less protein 
2800 2018-02-20 18:03:46 The mechanism of action is not dissolving oil. It is oil soluble but it works by loosening the attachments between cells.
2801 2018-02-20 18:03:28 The @UN literally issued a blank statement on #Syria saying that it had run out of words. 100 more people were killed today near Damascus. If Syria had oil, am sure some "Superpowers" would already be there!

2941 2018-02-20 17:45:49 You're exactly right, the purpose of the petro is to raise foreign capital, because monopoly over oil, expropriating private companies, and dealing drugs is no longer enough.

2944 2018-02-20 17:45:01 And how much is the gas and oil industry putting in to pay for environmental degradation and potential disasters?

2950 2018-02-20 17:43:59 Yes! And, that includes oil re-refiners who emit many tons of toxic air pollutants and have little or no regulations or controls placed on them by @OregonDEQ. When you cross the Columbia River and enter OR, you enter the Wild, Wild West of environmental law.
2951 2018-02-20 17:43:57 basically syria didnt accepte oil and gas line from qatar to eurpe to pass over its land so here we are after 7 years :)
2952 2018-02-20 17:43:54 If you want to parse the semantics go ahead.
I suggest you go back and look at all the rhetoric, in the period referenced in the original tweet, that said there could never be a material increase in US oil production.  Flat wrong.
2953 2018-02-20 17:43:41 Hahaha Oil money is the only way to go these days
2954 2018-02-20 17:43:39 Thinking about putting a bikini and some baby oil on and causing a car crash on 10th street by laying out on my driveway... Not because I'm hot. Because I'm so Damn white it's blinding and embarrassing!

2958 2018-02-20 17:42:49 The ones that die for oil?

That aren't even allowed to read or look at the documented truth of why their lives are traded for corporate profits?

That watch their leaders lie to their countrymen on TV every single day?

Democracy doesn't exist. We have more say in American Idol.
2959 2018-02-20 17:42:25 Thank God you're putting order California goes on the California coast and the California deserve what they get we need oil screw the fish in the environment

2961 2018-02-20 17:42:11 Ya know, it's not just the NRA buying up legislators but the Pharma and Oil industries as well. Must stop this money from getting to Congress. And punish those who allow lobbyists to write the laws of this country.
2962 2018-02-20 17:42:06 Soros???? WTAF @JackKingston? What are Koch bros doing for RWNJ members of Congress? The NRA? ISPs? Oil and gas cos? The Mercers? Sheldon Adelson? Have a seat Jack. You sound insane
2963 2018-02-20 17:41:48 Lavender and Frankincense is hands down the best essential oil combo
2964 2018-02-20 17:41:43 Because he wants us dependant on oil... That's why he isn't enforcing the sanctions! That's why he colluded with Russia. 
He needs to be imprisoned for Treason!!!

2973 2018-02-20 17:41:05 Absolutely agree.
2974 2018-02-20 17:41:01 I like castor oil better. Arian oil is too oily on my hair and works best if I use it as a hot oil treatment. I like castor oil because it’s thicker. Neither should be used every day.

2979 2018-02-20 17:40:25 For years? We had done Copenhagen modelling by 2012, published in 2014 as Kniewasser thesis - for which you graciously provided data. Showed Copenhagen not possible with the trend of oil sands expansion.
2980 2018-02-20 17:40:18 In other news:

"Plastic bans worldwide will increase oil & gas demand growth for glass-making furnaces, and, transportation energy use moving the much-heavier product, says BP"
2981 2018-02-20 17:40:00 I also always rinse the rice and always add a little oil and salt. Rice is grown in old cotton fields and can have arsenic contamination.
2982 2018-02-20 17:39:54 I shoutout carnegie for caring about the people and making an improvement in the society not like what the oil company is doing!!
2983 2018-02-20 17:39:45 A target is zero sum. You can replace oil sands with any other sector and the more emissions in any sector means more effort in other sectors.

3007 2018-02-20 17:36:57 @realDonaldTrump 
Idea to keep schools safe! Volunteer former military and police officers. Have trained K-9 dogs that can smell gun powder drugs Gun oil. Put them at the opening of the school. 4 volunteers and 4 K9 dogs per School. Two ways to get in 2 people + 2 dogs per door.
3008 2018-02-20 17:36:38 This kind of a terrible way to graph this. WC oil production was at a 9%+ annualized growth rate through to 2014-5, was it not? That's the real issue here -- way above world/pipeline/needed growth rates.

3021 2018-02-20 17:35:32 Yeah I use off scalp bleach it's not a huge deal it mostly is a risk of burning/itching feeling from it 

My recommendation? Go a couple days w/out washing your hair so your scalp has oil built up it is less likely to burn that way
3022 2018-02-20 17:35:21 If you would add Pharmacies, banks, law firms, and oil and gas companies, and promise to protect our National Parks you would be the answer to Utah politics.
3023 2018-02-20 17:35:12 Also.. crude oil has evolved overtime to make cars more fuel efficient. By application wouldn’t cells become more evolved too? We must always embark on new frontiers.. we’ll never know if we don’t push it as far as it will go

3032 2018-02-20 17:33:59 Philosophy, its too early for that. We have pesto and white sauce pizzas, even oil based sauces. Cheese is almost always there, but sometimes its just parm grated on top. Maybe a bit of mascarpone for strawberries.

3045 2018-02-20 17:32:16 Agreed 1000% on lack of vision. Remaining handcuffed to oil & gas is a serious long-term danger. Particularly since deepwater offshore is more vulnerable than fracking to dropping oil prices and looming peak oil.
3046 2018-02-20 17:32:06 @WolfChaseToyota This past Saturday, I took my Lexus for oil change. I’ve been taking my car to them for oil changes for years, regardless that I’ve been done wrong before. Nine yrs ago, they busted a cap off of the trunk of my Prius.

3049 2018-02-20 17:31:15 No. Your climate fraud is built on shutting down Oil, gas & coal industry, on carbon taxes that punishes the most vulnerable.
3050 2018-02-20 17:31:13 Just what do you plan on doing once the oil runs out? You must know that oil is a non-renewable resource. What use is there for your pipeline then? Also to the damage and pollution a pipeline will most certainly cause. What then?
3051 2018-02-20 17:31:04 Doesn’t bother me.  It’s like being insulted by my 7 year old.  Isn’t your 30 minute lunch break at the local oil lube over?

3060 2018-02-20 17:29:33 that is located on the Navajo Nation. The Dineh-bi-Keyah has produced in excess of 18,300,000 barrels of oil since 1969. The initial production rate of individual wells was as high as 3,300 barrels of oil per day. The #4 Navajo well has produced more than 3.5 million barrels.
3061 2018-02-20 17:29:28 Go on then. Support the “Greenhouse effect” with peer reviewed published papers and sound repeatable data. You know it was Margaret Thatcher that commissioned the IPCC funded by Rothschilds and Rockefeller. To close down the mining industry in U.K.  And burn oil and gas instead.

3081 2018-02-20 17:26:59 "It was no accident...that Phil Fontaine, three-time elected leader of the AFN, went on to become a highly paid consultant for Canadian banks, then an oil industry player & then turned up, literally, front & centre at the Trudeau victory celebration in October 2015." - Art Manuel
3082 2018-02-20 17:26:40 Coconut oil really should’ve been mentioned in the Black Panther credits
3083 2018-02-20 17:25:58 Di talaga ako nakikinig kay Reese Lansangan  and di ko din alam kung bakit nasa recommended ko siya after watching the Oil In Water version ng The Hound And The Fox but ang galing ng pagkakasulat ng Grammar Nazi

Baka maging fan ako nito

3084 2018-02-20 17:25:56 I respect your opinion, but you and @andrew_leach need to talk.
 
My understanding is that we need to reduce *demand* for fossil fuels (e.g. through CO2 pricing) - if we try to reduce Cdn *supply*, other suppliers (like US shale oil) will just take up the slack.
3085 2018-02-20 17:25:52 Did you get any oil on your flag pole?

3087 2018-02-20 17:25:51 PS--It's said that Oil (Koch, etc) and Tobacco Industry funded the Tea Party & paid demonstrators beginning at least in the 1980's. That's why EVERY protest by Progressive groups is labeled by Trump & others as "paid protestors." Wondering how all those payments get to millions?
3088 2018-02-20 17:25:46 Abeg wetin we do USA that they want to abandon our oil? Did Nigeria abuse his hair? Boko Haram again? I thought and thought again that they've been destroyed. @LagosTalks913

3092 2018-02-20 17:25:29 This nigga has literally made it to Fontana in my truck and is already calling me and all he’s doing is getting the oil changed.
3093 2018-02-20 17:25:12 Baby tip: If your baby has cradle cap try rubbing baby oil on the area
3094 2018-02-20 17:25:07 What about equality in things like oil jobs officers and construction as well? Or they just want the fun rich jobs?
3095 2018-02-20 17:25:00 That palm oil they use and definitely the awesome dick

3097 2018-02-20 17:24:58 no! I have a charcoal and coconut oil exfoliating shampoo and one of the huge reasons I use it is because it smells so good 
3098 2018-02-20 17:24:49 It means what it says...your club was essentially non-existent and irrelevant for 30 years until oil money came along
3099 2018-02-20 17:24:33 Haa you guys. If it's not face powder it may be oil from an oily face ka. But also you can buy her makeup remover ka
3100 2018-02-20 17:24:33 Have you *seen* some of the cars on the road?  Insurance isn't for MAINTENANCE...it's for accidents.

I can't get reimbursed for a ring job that I need after not changing my oil regularly. 

You're killing me with policy-by-silly-analogy!

$Oil was also boosted by supply disruptions from a key Canadian pipeline to the US.
3103 2018-02-20 17:23:51 Can I get a hug and an oil change?
3104 2018-02-20 17:23:10 Ukraine must have oil....
3105 2018-02-20 17:23:06 It also may be increasing support for more oil drilling in wilderness areas.
3106 2018-02-20 17:22:56 I agree Chris - I want independence, EU membership and internationalism, not isolationism (which seems to be a Brexiteer preference).  We don't need money from the English treasury (heck, Scotland's oil is keeping it afloat), we have massive oil reserves, our own industries, etc.
3107 2018-02-20 17:22:53 I think he is just anti Canadian oil. He sure seems to like the Saudi stuff - a lot!
3108 2018-02-20 17:22:53 That combined with Lavender essential oil in the diffuser should do the trick.

3115 2018-02-20 17:22:17 1/3 is tied to banking - consumer cannot be any more leveraged. 1/3 is tied to oil/resources: we can no longer compete - lower cost producers and over supply / Trudeau is bending us over on trade agreeements. Housing prices correcting = the HELOC atm spending growth = diminished.
3116 2018-02-20 17:22:03 Maduro asking for people's money in exchange for Petro without clear guidance on its use. No infrastructure for efficient exchange of this currency and is basically a government bond (oil backed). Using the crypto hype to try and replace lack of government trust?
3117 2018-02-20 17:21:57 Mystery Oil is some good stuff
3118 2018-02-20 17:21:47 any witches out there have natural menstural pain relief suggestions to get me through the workday? my back aches and cramps have gotten more intense and sometimes my CBD oil just doesn’t cut it. i could take motrin...but i take so much motrin.
3119 2018-02-20 17:21:41 ..who has noticed that the oil in condoms have been reduced.
3120 2018-02-20 17:21:40 Actually disarming US would restore our democracy. As it are we're a faux-democratic fascist oligarchy ruled by the military-CIA-Wall St-insurance-oil complex w 900 military bases & counterterrorism ops on indigenous protesters. Maybe pulling back on militarism wouldn't be so bad
3121 2018-02-20 17:21:35 Louisville just got their 2013 NCAA basketball vacated...Everybody know they won it that year...I went to the 2013 Elite 8 game between L'ville/Duke at Lucas Oil Stadium...

3131 2018-02-20 17:19:52 great point!! WHO at CPAC thinks IMF & Central Banks are "Conservative" entities or true Capitalist?? EU is all about One Size Fits All, you can check in but not check out ie BREXIT? Like mixing oil and water...doesn't work.

3163 2018-02-20 17:16:46 Coconut oil is not a moisturizer it’s a sealant. It seals in the moisture you already have which isn’t gonna help you if your skin/hair is dehydrated. Just gonna make it worse over time.

3213 2018-02-20 17:11:53 Took some fish oil after my tea earlier and realize it's a potentiator. Get your healthy fats in kids!
3214 2018-02-20 17:11:51 I’m not gonna mince words - I’m tired of co-workers asking me to donate to their kids school fundraisers.  When I was a kid I never asked my parents to hock my schools snake oil at their jobs.

You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over.

3218 2018-02-20 17:11:23 Meantime the father of the Koch brothers - notable GOP donors -amassed the family fortune through a Nazi oil refinery.

Look it up.
3219 2018-02-20 17:11:17 I read the so called "whitepaper" of the petro. The least I can say is that it is very approximate... I don't "oil backing" mechanism will actually work
3220 2018-02-20 17:11:15 Never Ever Have I Ever: touch  hot oil
3221 2018-02-20 17:11:11  I go on grosebeck it's like half a mile after dollar general. Just tell them you need an oil change
3222 2018-02-20 17:11:05 all I do is hand tools to the boys and sometimes pour oil into the car if i'm lucky, but im still 100% convinced i'm a real mechanic
3223 2018-02-20 17:10:47 Malcom, thank you for speaking the truth clearly!  Tillerson was hand picked for the Sec. of State job by Putin, as you mentioned he cut a $500B oil exploration deal with him while at Exxon.  Russia invaded Crimea to get control of port to export that oil!
3224 2018-02-20 17:10:34 BC currently has a surplus of hydro electric power and is building a new dam (site C I believe) I'd rather get that energy than more oil.
3225 2018-02-20 17:10:25 our Military are to be credited. Anyhow, it was all about Syrian Oil producing area.
3226 2018-02-20 17:10:14 This recent two Nirav Modi and rotomac case is very big. Oil is becoming costlier. Macroeconomics and microeconomics both in bad shape now.
3227 2018-02-20 17:10:12 what a beautiful day to do my oil and brakes

3233 2018-02-20 17:09:52 SOS someone send olive oil salt n straw ice cream to my dorm 
3234 2018-02-20 17:09:50 its profits that stand in the way of best practice - how can a plant described in the Bible with healing properties be illegal... plant oil has been around since day one,  the American constitution was written on hemp, hemp can replace all plastics - private profit dictates sense
3235 2018-02-20 17:09:50 I dont know all the details but as of July 1st (Canada Day), I believe it will be legal across the country for recreational use as well. I don't have all the details because I can currently use so I haven't been following along as closely as some.
I've been using oil for 2 years.
3236 2018-02-20 17:09:48 cum inna yuh belly every oil ride out
3237 2018-02-20 17:09:43 Engine oil*
3238 2018-02-20 17:09:27 I'm of the opinion that Oil of O'Lay should be just for flomenco dancers .
3239 2018-02-20 17:09:27 Well, she won the popular vote within the margin of error for the polls. So, the polls weren't wrong - they were pretty spot on. The analysis of the polls being peddled by some media outlets was just off. The reality is that most Americans think you people are scary as shit.
3240 2018-02-20 17:09:04 Also, what if the seller had no idea that hash oil contained the controlled substance tetrahydrocannabinol?
3241 2018-02-20 17:09:04 See, I never lived in that period. All I know is that during that time Britain went through a great deal of economic turmoil. Admittedly much of that was caused by external factors like oil cartels, but the point of the EU is to insulate from those factors.
3242 2018-02-20 17:09:01 Vitamin E oil got me out here glowin .

3245 2018-02-20 17:08:53 I don't deserve my boyfriend. After he saw how much pain I was in he started researching CBD oil. He went to the weed store and came back with CBD chocolates, oil, and lotion. #arthritis
3246 2018-02-20 17:08:49 All that Pitino hair oil finally ignited
3247 2018-02-20 17:08:47 @HamillHimself in “Corvette Summer,” when the bD Guy’s dunked you in that barrel of used motor oil, thAt wasn’t REALLY used motor oil, was it? I mean, that stuff is toxic. 
3248 2018-02-20 17:08:47 is it pronounced oil, or oil?
3249 2018-02-20 17:08:42 1bn does not go very far in oil clean up. Look at Alaska and the Exxon Valdez disaster
3250 2018-02-20 17:08:33 
3251 2018-02-20 17:08:29 That would imply he ever had it to lose. He's always been a con man & a fake. Sadly he's sold his snake oil to a lot of our fellow Americans.
3252 2018-02-20 17:08:28 If you are AGAINST Republicans receiving money from the #NRA  then YOU MUST be AGAINST Democrats receiving from Big Pharma, Healthcare Insurance, Real Estate Developers, Oil & Gas, Student Loan Collectors - who have put ppl in poverty, homelessness, illness, & death. #NOEXCUSES

3254 2018-02-20 17:07:59 What??? What's that got to do with anything?? (and Israel, incidentally, gave up the Sinai with all it's mineral & oil resource in a peace deal with Egypt...which still stands today...oh if only the Pals would choose peace instead of terrorism, eh?)
3255 2018-02-20 17:07:43 I hate coming to car places I just want new tires and they ask me a million other things.. do you want an inspection... new parts... want an oil change.. NO JUST THE TIRES

3262 2018-02-20 17:07:21 I’m saying there is public opinion only cares about what is on the front page of our news outlets. The more frequency of solar we see the more likely we are to adopt these practice and enhance the cells to be duly dependent on them. And not oil which is the root of most evil
3263 2018-02-20 17:07:21 I would love to oil you up

3265 2018-02-20 17:07:01 Coconut oil rub downs will do the trick.
3266 2018-02-20 17:06:48 Yes Vietnam was the straw. But you’re forgetting the petrodollar. USD became standard for oil in 74. Kissinger’s master plan in addition to there being no other country to challenge US hegemony during that time resulted in dollar reserve currency for a while longer...
3267 2018-02-20 17:06:45 i have oil paint EVERYWHERE it’s literally INSIDE my shoes !!!!
3268 2018-02-20 17:06:44 PSA if you see me today and my hair looks greasy I did in fact wash it, however I used coconut oil for a hair mask and that unfortunately makes my hair greasy but don’t worried I’m not s complete scrub I did shower
3269 2018-02-20 17:06:33 Man I was wondering why my car sounded like that  It was low on oil.
3270 2018-02-20 17:06:20 Not sure I could go out in public with processed oils on my hair. For starters the oil we have is lemon or basil as we brought it back from italy. So if I went out with that on my hair I might be followed home by all the neighborhood especially on Pancake day 
3271 2018-02-20 17:06:18 Today is expiration for March crude oil #OOTT
3272 2018-02-20 17:06:12 To put some numbers in perspective: In 2015 Total consumption of oil by transportation sector was around 2500 Million Tonnes Oil Equivalen(MtOE). Roughly that’s about 30,000 Terrawatt Hours.
3273 2018-02-20 17:06:02 PS. You can always use linseed oil or the sorts to treat the wood before using since it will be outside in the elements.
3274 2018-02-20 17:06:00 favouritism &, friendship in a working place can turn in to oil and water at the end.

3276 2018-02-20 17:05:37 I do know the UAE takes care of their citizens with oil money. But non-citizens are tolerated until their job ends then they boot them out. Non-citizens get nothing there. We should try that and save tons.

3279 2018-02-20 17:04:45 It’s clear people who are invested in the old system of fiat are gonna do what they can to hold it back. Humans have created an engine that runs on air, but Big Oil bought the design and hid it from the public. Big Banks are gonna do the same. #altcoins #btc #bitcoin #crypto
3280 2018-02-20 17:04:42 I wish they'd revolt against the political party and media that divides everyone into groups and foments hatred within the country. This is a morals/society/mental health issue.
3281 2018-02-20 17:04:41 Money backed by oil?? You mean oil meant to be burn??? You mean I trust Maduro to keep oil to back a coin????? Is this serious???????????

3285 2018-02-20 17:04:02 By the way, I just bought some new oil pastels yesterday, one of them is actually called "Dusty Rose" and looks remarkably similar to that SKIN color.

Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry.
3288 2018-02-20 17:03:52 I'm going to be completely honest. I had no idea Ed wore black clothes so oil stains from his arms and legs wouldn't show.
3289 2018-02-20 17:03:50 Not feeling bullish on a barrel of oil per coin? If you can't trust Maduro who can you trust?

3298 2018-02-20 17:02:34 I use ashes arnd the plant, spray with a neem oil solution, Marigold arnd helps. Don’t wet the cabbage when watering, prune away leaves dragging on earth. And above all be vigilant when they start to fold, I examine them twice daily to pick of worms etc. Some persons use nets.
3299 2018-02-20 17:02:11 Pa always give us a teaspoon of turpentine every fall to keep us from gettin the croup and a tablespoon of caster oil in the spring. We didn’t have no healthcare and we’s all doin grate.

3306 2018-02-20 17:01:23 Me too. Adored my Q5. Oil drama for daysss... Followed by “mechatronics” (a sin that I even know the word). Then finally went out of motor plan with no end in sight to the problems. I was gutted and feel the brand let me down BIG time. Never expected to pay that much for rubbish
3307 2018-02-20 17:01:23 Also Cannabis or more appropriately ‘Hemp’, has many many uses, such as- Precisely, Grass is Green! Henry Ford built a car 70 years ago from HempGlass Fibre for the panels, fuel, lubrication and Hydraulic fluids made from Hemp Seed Oil.

3309 2018-02-20 17:01:13 I've heard that this product called "Banish" works well. Bio oil is more for stretchmarks and uneven skin tones. It might work for acne scarring though. Who knows

3329 2018-02-20 16:59:14 stay away from this, they will just take all your cash.  The government is not making enough from oil... they need some other way to take your money! And this time not only from Venezuelans this is a scam left and right, this is not a government, it's band of thieves.
3330 2018-02-20 16:58:45 Enquest says that its Kraken project has overcome start-up issues and is now performing better than expected, sending shares in the North Sea oil producer sharply higher.

3340 2018-02-20 16:57:44 People constantly rail against CA, but they do protect their citizens (at least they try). I'm fine paying taxes to combat - not enrich - Big Oil, the NRA, scammers/fraudsters and other groups tearing down other states and locales.
3341 2018-02-20 16:57:30 The same interests that got Hemp criminalised in the beginning, the Timber and Oil, Industries etc. Who made the propaganda ‘info commercial’ vid called ‘Reefa Madness’, that shows ‘conventional looking’ people falling all over the place, out of control and loosing it.

3345 2018-02-20 16:57:24 Very good analysis, nicely detailed and explained, thx. Is the conclusion that both KMX and TMX are needed, given oil sands production (from existing operations) outlook over the next few years, or that one of them +/- rail is sufficient to eliminate the discount?
3346 2018-02-20 16:57:22 Fossil fuels are on the way out. Our position must be ASAP. The Canadian economy is booming without the polluting Tar Sands. Even Alberta is fine without oil. Nobody needs it.
3347 2018-02-20 16:57:13 @globaltimesnews Of course, Elon will also help you with electric car technology.  The U.S. wants to stand and protect big oil so we will not be a competitor.
3348 2018-02-20 16:57:12 I luved watching Oil Rich $$ Citeah crash out of the FA Cup and the ode to Will Griggs:
Roses are red

Your quadruple is too
3349 2018-02-20 16:57:08 There is a war between Iran and Israel and the oil failed will be target for Iranian because it is easy to reach so be ready this war will start any second so good luck
3350 2018-02-20 16:57:07 The eye area has virtually no oil glands. Therefore, it’s the first area of the face to show aging from facial expressions like squinting and smiling. It’s essential to protect this area with a well-formulated eye cream #skincare
3351 2018-02-20 16:56:56 He’s probably already set up a few oil companies to make sure he profits from oil
3352 2018-02-20 16:56:50 Cut the gas and oil to BC. Let them freeze in the dark.
3353 2018-02-20 16:56:49 Twice a day tu like gap between 12 hours right ? Hmmm macam lama sangat dah oil and dirts bukak kampung baru nanti

3357 2018-02-20 16:56:33 but you're the oil minister? Tell us who is corrupt there
3358 2018-02-20 16:56:15 I dabble in the icecold showers here an their and I’ve seen benefits it’s just a matter of having the discipline to b more consistent with it.. isn’t the jojoba oil more for concentrated blemishes tho or can I spread it across my whole face for an overall healthier complexion?
3359 2018-02-20 16:56:13 ive smoked sutin along those lines, the lavender turns to oil, n calms u n ur lungs, very lit
3360 2018-02-20 16:56:00 Let me tell yall how I get burn with hot oil this morning, my hand still hurting 
3361 2018-02-20 16:55:59 Good morning to jojoba oil users only
3362 2018-02-20 16:55:41 Yes I do like the natural product. Much more gentle on your hair and body for that matter. I am not sure about putting olive oil on my hair though. I might smell of pasta making ! 
3363 2018-02-20 16:55:28 Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission director Matt Lepore resigning effective March 2. Headed to Adamantine Energy. Julie Murphy, of Energy and Minerals at CO DNR, appointed to be new director.
3364 2018-02-20 16:55:22 $CHK just on oil alone not NG. U talking 100k/day @ ~ $60. That’s 6 mil/day *365 =2.1 B /yr just on oil rev. Y’all worried bout 9 b debt?
3365 2018-02-20 16:55:20 Very excited that we just inked a deal to replace our oil furnace with an air source heat pump. Working towards a #FossilFreeFuture. Care to join me?
3366 2018-02-20 16:55:15 clean energy? batteties assiciated w wind+solar are clean? Renewable is not clean, but cleanER than oil and burning fossil fuels. Batteries for power storage require oil and machinery and chems for production. Just a thought.  Cleaner is better but still not "clean".
3367 2018-02-20 16:55:10 ये बात बिल्कुल सच है, नीच कुत्ते का बीज है केजरीवाल और ये नीच से नीच कर्म कर सकता है । इसको तो जूता चप्पल से मरना चाहिए और संतोष कोली के कटल के इल्जाम में फांसी देनी चाहिए ।

3369 2018-02-20 16:55:06 When heating up oil on pan. Is it called boiling the oil or frying it??
3370 2018-02-20 16:55:05 Damn this pic looks like an oil painting.. I see no imperfections, just a work of art like you are  Even though there's too much hair on your face 
Anyway I'm coming in Rome and Milan   See you there boo 
3371 2018-02-20 16:55:05 Nothing like getting your oil changed to waste a work day
3372 2018-02-20 16:54:52 But the flames on the candles didn’t ignite the oil!
3373 2018-02-20 16:54:42 Loads of oil needed to satisfy those two holes hump day is hear 
3374 2018-02-20 16:54:29 when there’s no wait to get an oil change >

3379 2018-02-20 16:53:28 What makes your hair grow and don’t tell me coconut oil 
3380 2018-02-20 16:53:26 Methane is trapped in the perfafrost... because it's made up of decomposing organic material, including oil/gas... I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here? That permafrost isn't made from organic material? That melting permafrost doesn't crack house foundations?
3381 2018-02-20 16:53:24 Ther is something called baby oil use it 
3382 2018-02-20 16:53:22 Colorado’s official charged with regulating the oil and gas industry will resign effective March 2
3383 2018-02-20 16:53:12 Then impose the sanctions. The ones for Russian attack on a the Ukraine. The sanctions that froze the deal between Exxon and the Putin controlled oil company.     That's what they paid you for. The money trail is what will get you.  Greed is your Achilles heel.
3384 2018-02-20 16:53:02 I Need To Get Some More Castor Oil

3387 2018-02-20 16:52:39 #Abbas delivering a “moderate” speech to the #UNSC is akin to the “snake oil” salesman guaranteeing a cure for what ails you. No one who has tried it, buys it again.
3388 2018-02-20 16:52:36 Barring occasional riots over pork or such, things seem to have been OK, they hold prominent local positions, serve in the army and so on, even got advertised as exotic minority, esp for oil rich Arabs.. my impression they were fairly integrated..
3389 2018-02-20 16:52:36 Ever eat any gummy candies? The. You’ve eaten oil, anything deep fried? Oil again, bought anything at a supermarket? How you think it got there? Don’t get me wrong I’m a strong proponent for green energy but you won’t have it at the expense of the oil industry.
3390 2018-02-20 16:52:35 Stupid See the crude oil price for 2011, 2012 and 2013
3391 2018-02-20 16:52:23 Can you imagine what we can achieve if we help Ontarians add a daily dose of exercise and protective foods (eg. Medi diet) ? Starting to prescribe exercise, now let's prescribe vegetables,fruits, nuts, olive oil,yoghurt and fish! @Mac_AgingNews @CEPhealth #lifestyleismedicine
3392 2018-02-20 16:52:21 Public so easily swayed to take their eyes off prize. Don’t get distracted. Every day they get us to stop talking abt Wealth Inequality, Single Payer, Election Reform, Net Neutrality, Big Oil, Environment, Police Violence etc. They consider it victory. For the 1% #TuesdayThoughts
3393 2018-02-20 16:52:19 Are you using CBD oil?  Share with us! What is it helping you with? 
Never used it? The comments are going to blow your mind! 
3394 2018-02-20 16:52:17 This oil change is it
3395 2018-02-20 16:52:14 What’s wrong with coconut oil though?
3396 2018-02-20 16:52:02 I’m on the hunt for a good beard oil or beard balm. Anyone know any good brands??
3397 2018-02-20 16:51:43 My bonnet just started smoking while I was driving after I refilled my oil and I’ve never shit myself so much in my life
3398 2018-02-20 16:51:42 Mix of chicken and oil. I pour it down my drain with hot water.

3400 2018-02-20 16:51:33 @DavidDavisMP I must have missed the bit where people predicted that water and oil would become scarce commodities post-brexit leading to an apocalyptic battle Royale between road warrior tribes ruled by chieftain overlords. Thanks for the clarity of the govt position at last!
3401 2018-02-20 16:51:31 Fuck what the establishment are saying, get out there and get some oil! My grandad used it when he had cancer and he not only felt relieved, but actually went into a remission. Not saying it was the oil, but he definitely lived more comfortably whilst using it.
3402 2018-02-20 16:51:21 No soy fanática. Me molesta mucho quienes buscan el pelo en la leche (q POR SUPUESTO hay q colar), pero no ven el bosque de fondos públicos q debemos recuperar. X ej. No es lo mismo evasión impositiva, q defraudación al fisco (Oil C. y Oca), sobreprecios (Lázaro) o coimas (Jaime)
3403 2018-02-20 16:51:13 pruitt, zinke, perry, rexxon, koch bros., putin. big oil deal underway.

3406 2018-02-20 16:50:59 To be exact, the pain is regional.  On regional basis, the pain is similar to OPEC nations, and probably worse because workers in national oil companies do not lose their jobs with lower oil prices.  Check the finances of states like Alaska, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.
3407 2018-02-20 16:50:41 Gh8rii8u ggt 4 GC jr oil H decree ut ithoihoi hoi you tyouri tptf
3408 2018-02-20 16:50:32 Think you will find the oil is still there, but they now have to hit the correct spot with all the new data collected... Onto HH1 now where it has already flowed handsomely.
3409 2018-02-20 16:50:13 @Convertbond opinion on oil futures? You’ve been spot on in the past sir.
3410 2018-02-20 16:50:02 I for one, would not eat oil.
3411 2018-02-20 16:49:52 Coconut oil in ur coffee. Its an energy boost too! Who knew? 
3412 2018-02-20 16:49:37 Well, I'd say there's an even bigger difference between the troll farm indictment which was probably only intended to place a noose around Congress' neck to preserve the investigation, and today's indictment of Van der Zwaan with ties directly to Russian oil and money laundering.
3413 2018-02-20 16:49:33 Would be interesting to know how MCT oil supplementation only (no diet changes) would turn out. Also, kids on these diets need routine blood monitoring for cholesterol levels etc.
3414 2018-02-20 16:49:26 肌汚くなってきた
3415 2018-02-20 16:49:21 I don't measure but 1:1:2 of coffee, sugar and oil should be ok. You can just use coffee grounds+oil too.
3416 2018-02-20 16:49:20 Great info from @SytorusDP  “personal data is the new oil”. - Clive humby - lots to think about.
3417 2018-02-20 16:49:20 Got more oil in my garden shed..absolutely disgraceful from Lenigas and NOMAD
3418 2018-02-20 16:49:14 Or try vitamin e oil! Vitamin e oil for skin is made specifically for scarring and healthy aging, everyone’s skin type is different so if you don’t see results from that, give that a go too 
3419 2018-02-20 16:49:12 Donny Eat some KFC please. May be that oil stained fingers will keep you from tweeting
3420 2018-02-20 16:48:52 You forgot the illegal targeting of conservative non-profits by the IRS. You want un-American? How about the billions of tax dollars sent to support overseas oil while crippling our own oil industry.
3421 2018-02-20 16:48:45 Most PDS beneficiaries in Delhi probably prefer dal and oil instead. Cc @msisodia @AtishiMarlena one good turn (getting rid of aadhaar) deserves another (adding dal and oil).
3422 2018-02-20 16:48:41 Syrian border ??  US and PYD respect syria's unity and sovereignity ??????      what does pyd try to do.. ??? They have been hired to US  to fight for US ' oil kingdom
3423 2018-02-20 16:48:14 Laura Govan’s hair is hair goals...time to castor oil my shit day and night
3424 2018-02-20 16:48:09 @Uncanny @dgrams yep. These guys on here . They don’t understand how much money $chk is making. These guys are pumping oil
3425 2018-02-20 16:48:04 djt, rexxon, putin want to get control of artic worth billions in oil.
3426 2018-02-20 16:47:54 I think to James’ point, American society is much less likely to feel the pain of oil price collapse (and in many/most it is a windfall) than the societies of the avg OPEC nation. Investors losses in US are much more isolated from broader society than redistribution practices.
3427 2018-02-20 16:47:51 A lot of exclamation points!!!! Maybe that will make her stupid argument sound better!!!!
3428 2018-02-20 16:47:47 And oil ol
3429 2018-02-20 16:47:46 Maybe 1% of@public are talking about wind turbines. Money is in oil and people wanna eat and pay their bills
3430 2018-02-20 16:47:45 I understand plenty it has no NO medical effect whatsoever by the time it gets to oil you might as well chug sunflower all for all the actual effect it has. Evidence based medicine is necessary for genuine treatment not fairy tails and a pat on the head.
3431 2018-02-20 16:47:45 It's amazing. In South Africa, cannabis oil has become mainstream for pain relief, for both humans and animals, apparently. Just anecdotally, people in my circle swear by it for chronic pain relief. Sounds like a serious policy debate is overdue for the UK.
3432 2018-02-20 16:47:41 Maybe is was Sanderson's escape truck.  No oil here!!!
3433 2018-02-20 16:47:24 Ready to try something new? Our Nurturing Rose Shampoo & Conditioner contains a moisturising blend of coconut & olive oil for healthy hair!
3434 2018-02-20 16:47:15 We hold this truth to be self-evident: NRA, Pharma and Oil, etc. = East India Trading Co.'s influence upon Parliament 242 years ago.
3435 2018-02-20 16:47:11 Dry shampoo on top, hair oil on the ends...#hairproblems #ouai
3436 2018-02-20 16:46:59 Use WD40 or equiv. Douche it heavily in it and let it soak. Repeat every half hour for a while. Dont rush it, let the oil do what its good at. Try removing tomorrow.

You can buy new holders and nuts for it, as long as you dont damage the spindle attached to the Dremel itself
3437 2018-02-20 16:46:53 Omg. We have big oil in Canada too. (  see Tar Sands Alberta & Kinder Morgan pipeline) but we DO NOT rage a war with the  Solar Industry. I have friends with kids who work in the Solar industry. That is where the jobs are now.
3438 2018-02-20 16:46:50 With world population rising, demand for food will increase, making it more expensive & less available for UK. Couple that with oil reserves reducing long term, the sooner UK becomes more sustainable, the better.
If we can produce a surplus of some products, all the better.
3439 2018-02-20 16:46:43 Probably fried the eggs on the engine and cooked the hashbrowns in motor oil
3440 2018-02-20 16:46:39 I didnt put oil but i finally did put it in sumpah rasa awkward cs ive been wearing nose stud all along  u ada piercing ke oniee?
3441 2018-02-20 16:46:38 US crude oil rise on opec cuts, falling dollar, pipeline disruptions in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria
3442 2018-02-20 16:46:37 Something, something, "peak oil", they said.
Old enough to remember someone saying "drill baby drill"
3443 2018-02-20 16:46:36 kids playing with G.I.joes is so cute, i love how they put so much imagination into superhero’s who are designed to protect the U.S’s foreign oil interests
3444 2018-02-20 16:46:27 Agreed. It's always about the econony. We can't abandon millions of American workers just to take down the oil industries. We need as many people on-board as possible.
3445 2018-02-20 16:46:26 Don't fret about Singapore.
State of Alaska has been paying its people dividends from oil.
3446 2018-02-20 16:46:12 There's no other "ally" that can actually get unconstitutional laws passed that prohibit boycotting their war crimes & they're the only "ally" that all our politicians bend over backwards for to get involved in all their pointless oil wars. We'd be much better off without them.
3447 2018-02-20 16:46:07 Talk to us when City don't buy the league with Oil money

3448 2018-02-20 16:45:52 I got my oil diffusers today  the trap house is about to smell all types of wonderful
3449 2018-02-20 16:45:44 It likely is, all these companies are together on this product development. The driving force was a major oil and gas organization in north america
3450 2018-02-20 16:45:09 uncomfortability & growth are like oil & water... they don’t go together.
3451 2018-02-20 16:45:08 Alex's father-in-law is German Khan. Russian oligarch worth billions. He sold his oil company to Rosneft Oil in 2013. Rosneft is huge part of the Steele dossier. Where Trump was promised 19.5% of the company in exchange for cooperating with / colluding in the 2016 election.
3452 2018-02-20 16:45:08 Coal is by far the #1 source of electricity in Germany and there is no conceivable way coal will lose that top position soon. 
Note: in TOTAL energy, oil is the #1 source of energy in Germany.

3456 2018-02-20 16:44:59 only if the yanks butt out... but unfortunately the CIA (et all )been pimping out South American countries & there governments to the oil & drugs industries for generations. Don't see civility & justices coming in a hurry to Venezuela.. unless we crucify the U.S. of Assholes
3457 2018-02-20 16:44:59 my face is getting so damn oily from my damn moisturizer. this is why I buy oil free moisturizer oh my god
3458 2018-02-20 16:43:59 I wonder what nation you want to build. A nation that don't see you as an equal citizen. A nation that have brutalised your people. I wonder why people don't see that one nigeria is only about oil.
3459 2018-02-20 16:43:58 Hate sitting waiting for my car to get a oil change. Seem like they take forever #onlywhenitsfree
3460 2018-02-20 16:43:42 CBD oil is the way forward, even FORBES predict a bright future. All natural has to be good for those like me who can't take prescription drugs or weed.
3461 2018-02-20 16:43:37 Who will have oil in their lamps? And who will be trying to buy oil when He comes?
3462 2018-02-20 16:43:30 They've gotten away with this kind of stuff for yrs. they are surprised now that many smart men and women are laying bare their dishonesty and cheating. trump is a prime example. He's always been a fraud and a charlatan, lying and cheating his way to success. A snake oil salesman
3463 2018-02-20 16:43:19 OK, explain Trump's decision and justication to keep hold of Syria's resources (50% of his oil production) for the Kurds when they make up 10% of the population? This is blatantly an illegal move considering US presence in Syria is Int. illegal.
3464 2018-02-20 16:43:00 What would change your stance on #FRR? 80m MC with 30m Debt (not exact figures), say if FRR come in with a commercial field with multi TCF recoverable and 100s of millions of recoverable oil. And internal estimates of 202tcf of gas resource.
3465 2018-02-20 16:42:57 Significant upside reversals in $CL_F right around 11am (European close) last 5 trading days. Seems that as soon as the brits head for the pub, American start buying oil hand over fist... #OOTT

3468 2018-02-20 16:42:52 I need to take my car for an oil change before I go to Charlotte
3469 2018-02-20 16:42:33 "You've got oil on your face.", he muttered and wiped it away with his sleeve.

"It's a very simple speeder but it can be very fast if one should want that."
3470 2018-02-20 16:42:31 Toad trump has been bought & paid, just like Scott Pruitt by the gas & oil & coal industry.
3471 2018-02-20 16:42:29 but really I got this nice package oil and deals on wheels fam
3472 2018-02-20 16:42:21 Think of other ways to prosper rather than dirty oil! Shame on Alberta policy makers, I live in Alberta!
3473 2018-02-20 16:42:14 Please understand more about cbd oil.

3478 2018-02-20 16:41:34 राजनाथ अंकल पहली बार आप को कुछ करने का मौका मिला है 4 साल में, फुस्स मत हो जाना ।
3479 2018-02-20 16:41:34 A simple bit of Googling reveals all my friend. Subsidies abound where politicians can be bought.

Just because you’re an oil and gas advocate doesn’t mean you can abdicate your responsibility to the environment and, more importantly, your kids.
3480 2018-02-20 16:41:26 Tea tree oil is such a good alternative to moisturizer. It smells great 

Goodnight world!

3482 2018-02-20 16:40:43 Matt why do you, Cristina Duran, and Ellienot support a 2500 ft setback from oil and gas activity?

3486 2018-02-20 16:39:54 I have IBD, and when shit gets bad (pun intended, sorry), the relief I get from smoking a small joint is instant. Pain gone, body relaxed & I wake up feeling better. Don't want to be stoned 24/7 though, so cannabis medication would be ideal (CBD oil is not affordable long term).
3487 2018-02-20 16:39:48 Peak shale is when no matter how much effort you exert you cannot increase production profitably . If the price of oil goes back up to 200$ barrel production should rise

3494 2018-02-20 16:39:16 Depends on your tank system. Ours runs on heating oil and we have it leased from the oil company, meaning it gets a yearly service + 24/7 emergency service if something goes wrong (which it did, on a holiday, and we had someone come right out). I can't speak to electric though.
3495 2018-02-20 16:39:12 You had the neocons running around saying Iraq’s oil would pay for the war. Rumsfeld was a cheap hawk who tried to run Iraq on the cheap post-invasion. That worked out horribly. Horribly.

3504 2018-02-20 16:38:40 Today's close: USD-INR: 64.79

3510 2018-02-20 16:38:07 I looveeeee it! It makes my skin feel great! But I mix the tea tree because it’s not good to apply a strong concentration of the oil directly to your face
3511 2018-02-20 16:38:03 How nice of us to give away our oil.
3512 2018-02-20 16:37:26 I just put coconut oil in my coffee and I actually really like it
3513 2018-02-20 16:37:26 $zn worth maybe $0.50. Any oil discovery will make it worth less, as the expenses are going to rise; dilution increase; assets decrease.

3527 2018-02-20 16:35:12 As a British Columbian opposed to the pipeline, the solution seems so simple.  The oil industry, guaranteed by the Province of Alberta and/or the Govt of Canada, agree to clean up any spill in the pipeline or on the coast.
3528 2018-02-20 16:34:58 Egyptians been using argan oil for centuries.  I use it for everything from hair conditioner to body oil, nails, skin, hair, dog and you can buy food quality stuff too. Lol.  Either that or black seed oil. Lol. Any but oil is best for hair, argan, macadamia, almond or olive oil.

3531 2018-02-20 16:34:40 Any way I agree that the fact BC uses oil is not an argument for someone who is against Canada exporting it's resources. 

I am for Canada exploiting it's global environmental advantage to export the lowest impact resources on the planet and make our lives better.

3583 2018-02-20 16:27:30 Yes of course of I realize it, that's why I would rather go to a functional democracy where people still have more rights than corporations.

3623 2018-02-20 16:23:25 Yeah, cleansers can definitely be the culprit! I tend to use balm or oil cleansers once it gets colder, they leave behind a nice amount of nourishing moisture.

3629 2018-02-20 16:22:20 All you have to do is look at innovation & tech coming from Europe that makes them less dependent on oil and contrast that with the continued dependence of Americans (Canada included). on oil. Just look at Alberta's gov't. Slow oil consumption while promoting continued sales?

3633 2018-02-20 16:21:47 Like refusing to implement the Russian Sanctions Bill, which was passed in July with only five no votes from both the Senate and House of Representatives? You reluctantly sign it but refused to enact the bill. Maybe it’s that $500 billion oil deal that drives you. #FollowTheMoney

3645 2018-02-20 16:20:31 Yesterday in class my Geology professor attempted to give a demonstration of how oil extraction works on an oil rig... using her hands and mouth... it was literally a demonstration on sucking cock.
3646 2018-02-20 16:20:31 Ican't believe that the only time I wast on a healthy  diet  was  during my  first  trimester cause I craved boiled veggies without cooking oil only row tomatoes  those days  
3647 2018-02-20 16:20:23 That was exactly my impression. Or Saddam's proposed move to switch to the Euro for Iraqi oil. Or the unfortunate deep sea cable accident streak when Iran's Oil Bourse started.

3650 2018-02-20 16:19:47 Either way, oil looks poised to repeat it's falling act. I arrived to my destination. Flying and staring out the window is fun. Flying and see oil fall is fun too :)
3651 2018-02-20 16:19:23 They do oil changes with the drivers in the wheel now. I opened up to get out and he like “nah you good, you can sit in the car if you want”
3652 2018-02-20 16:19:19 @HighwaysSEAST if I ask very nicely could you possibly turn Cam 15152 (A3 Wisley) around to face the M25? I think it may have been moved after last weeks oil spill and not turned back? Thanks Adam @eagleradio

3667 2018-02-20 16:18:15 All this story does ia reaffirm my belief that everyone has a price. And that all roads lead to Russia, which seems to be able to spend a lot of money on propaganda. Must be oil money.
3668 2018-02-20 16:18:01 mane, I hate coming to get a oil change
3669 2018-02-20 16:17:19 Because canadian oil is selling at $30 discount to WTI

3672 2018-02-20 16:17:11 Haha. True. Ikut kulit masing-masing. Ada yg mmg dah banned certain ingredient dlm produk. Tak kira lah org suka sgt. Tapi aku tetap tak minat. Contohnya mineral oil.

3674 2018-02-20 16:17:09 I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but if you're looking for a healthy way of keeping your skin moisturized while wearing make up then definitely try oil drop primer that consists of real oil that's good for yo skin.
3675 2018-02-20 16:17:08 Considering I live in the HQ city of Irving Oil, there are surprisingly few Irving gas stations in the city. There’s an Irving on every corner at home. I miss Cole harbour.

3677 2018-02-20 16:17:02 Lol!Yeah, I usually do too. Haven’t interfaced with a liberal troll lately. I’m sure it won’t be long before the name calling starts then it tootles little sheep.

3679 2018-02-20 16:16:58 Public spending is counted in sterling. But you cannot run the country's economy on sterling alone. You yourself said we need USD to buy oil. We also need Euros to buy Irish beef and French Golden Delicious. We are not a single currency economy.
3680 2018-02-20 16:16:51 Love clean coal.  Love clean fracking.  Love clean oil.  Clean is the way to go.   Love rubber tires cleanly burning.
3681 2018-02-20 16:16:43 So as to turn public against them? Do they publish the cost impact of subsidies to the oil & gas industries on energy bills?

3689 2018-02-20 16:15:37 Employee purge continues @CITGO with more employees relieved deemed "too close" to the former regime ...being let go is better than being thrown into military prison like some CITGO officers, the legal department was hard hit, along with a leading oil trader  #PDVSA #CITGO #oil
3690 2018-02-20 16:15:34 Remember really well what things were like,

3692 2018-02-20 16:15:23 You'll get oil and other pollutants on it that will never come out.
3693 2018-02-20 16:15:20 fyi I would note oil's dragonfly doji (or is it a shooting star, now)  is exactly what we saw in the $SOX index on Friday ...  $WTI $OIL #confirmation
3694 2018-02-20 16:15:17 i quite like you..however yr being disingenuous regarding venezuela..sactions by america and the saudi's reducing the price of oil dramatically is the main cause of their problem..cuz they dont go along with the globle agenda..yr an intelligent women..so surely you know this?
3695 2018-02-20 16:14:40 CNN has articles in support of oil companies and just saw an ad for Koch Industries on NBC a couple days ago while watching the Olympics. Bet I can guess why they don't cover climate change stories.

The Brave Daughter KUYILI drenched herself in OIL & Ghee, set herself on fire and blew up the ammunitions stored by the British in Storehouse.
3697 2018-02-20 16:14:33 I guess it’s due to economy..India is Iran’s 2nd biggest customer for the oil !!

3702 2018-02-20 16:14:04 Getting off oil because it spawns violence.  Ok, given oil is all over the planet but Lithium Mining, Cobalt mining, rare-earths, copper is not as wide-spread and in smaller regions, who is to say same tribal-violence doesn't "protect" those raw inputs?

3706 2018-02-20 16:12:36 No only that, TU Delft sells technologies to national oil companies like Saudi Aramco which provide them the capacity to produce more oil, to buy weapons, which enable them to terrorise Yemen, killing kids indiscriminately.@Tudelft

3709 2018-02-20 16:12:13 Tell me about it. Same with our oil supplier. They won't fill mine cos it's got a small crack on top of the tank.

3711 2018-02-20 16:11:39 Definitely feels safer to be walking around a #solarpeaker than a refinery. Maybe this will change the "smells like money" attitude of the oil sector. MOST solar installers do not realize that distributed solar battery market segment offers the best ROI for MOST of the USA.

3716 2018-02-20 16:11:04 This is an excellent question, the answer to which may well be a determining factor in the success of the project. Maduro has stated that each coin will be redeemable for 1 barrel of oil and has earmarked 5 billion barrels for this purpose. The devil will be in the details.
3717 2018-02-20 16:11:01 Having a massage is all fun and games until the masseuse gets oil in your hair and you spend the rest of the day looking like you have no idea what shampoo is
3718 2018-02-20 16:10:50 Unfortunately, it will probably be delayed again and again. Big oil interests are just too huge. Unless people start realizing despite info-intoxication and stop voting for petrol-heads. Or just BEV cars become cheaper to buy than dinosaur ones (which will happen in a few years).

3727 2018-02-20 16:10:09 Yes! We have to ensure that those in the oil industry have jobs after the the oil industry falls. They will still produce energy, but their line of work will be much more meaningful and may pay more. We can't abandon them, or else they will vote us out.

3763 2018-02-20 16:07:13 @howitbeganshow Hi Brad, would love to pitch a podcast segment on the forgotten women of NH who fought against Aristotle Onassis' plan to build an oil refinery. Interested?
3764 2018-02-20 16:07:08 I'm. Still. Waiting. to see the Trump administration making a smart move in Syria. Other than supporting YPG (mostly in areas where the Kurds control oil fields but emphatically not where they have olive oil fields) the US has only been navel gazing and bowing down to Turkey
3765 2018-02-20 16:07:07 oh yeah. I have 16k miles on my car. should have had the tires rotated at 5k and my oil changed at 10k 
3766 2018-02-20 16:07:02 All sorts of businesses employ Cartographers - very popular are emery - Oil and Gas and renewables - councils, environmental companies, but also more into graphic designers who work with urban designers.

3770 2018-02-20 16:06:34 Aku nggak pernah smoothing dll sih tapi coba pakai L'oreal Extraordinary Oil, itu bikin rambut jadi halus banget gampang disisir, jadi lebih jatuh.
3771 2018-02-20 16:06:33 Yet when she got elected she started working with the oil sector. Funny how her entire life stopped when she was elected. Are you bitching about Jason's hand in the current transfer payments, or that Alberta jobs are given to non Albertans from his TFW program?

3773 2018-02-20 16:06:11 But the economy! ....which is totally a hollow argument since new investment and jobs in greener energy would way offset any losses as we wean ourselves of oil and coal.  They only care to get richer....
3774 2018-02-20 16:06:07 You probably should have already had your oil changed and tires rotated allie 
3775 2018-02-20 16:05:44 Aw, c’mon. Can’t you do better that that?  I’m expending creative energy here and you’re going to respond with cut and paste?  Everywhere has poor folks, honey.  Well, gotta go.  The oil in this Durango isn’t going to change itself.
3776 2018-02-20 16:05:39 it was a good ego check for me to take my car to the shop, proud that i could identify that the problem is with the VTEC in my engine, just for them to call me and say it went out because i neglected to put oil in the engine for too long ....  i tried
3777 2018-02-20 16:05:37 Let's hope the police and stewards hit by advertising boardings start legal proceedings against the brainless citeh fans. Classless club, oil money, small club.
3778 2018-02-20 16:05:32 Wow! Just like I said, skysports would do everything possible to shift blame away from oil city. It's only proving to more neutral fans that city have an unhealthy relationship with certain media . Already the most hated team in the UK, now skysports are losing subscribers
3779 2018-02-20 16:05:18 Gonna start oil pulling every morning. Then brushing my teeth with activated charcoal.
3780 2018-02-20 16:05:11 Hi Karen, great to hear you are saying YES to #sustainable #palmoil. Consumer demand for sustainable palm oil will help in transforming the industry, ensuring that this type of palm oil becomes the norm.

3800 2018-02-20 16:03:30 In the early 20c, lockbox bills around fuel taxes were pushed by driver lobbies, not by Standard Oil.
3801 2018-02-20 16:03:05 are you not smart enough people to refine your oil yourselves or are you lazy and find it easiest to just sell the least valuable profitable part of oil
3802 2018-02-20 16:03:04 Poor reading comprehension? If I said the political parties don’t control the price of oil why would I blame the NDP.
3803 2018-02-20 16:03:00 I was using clove oil the last few days which stopped the pain but last night  even that stopped working
3804 2018-02-20 16:02:53 I hate this. Is no one caring that Syria is nothing but rubble and a killing field? My heart cries for these trapped men women and children. We must make a better more loving world. Is oil all that counts?

You act like you’re the only person who knows anything about everything and you never have an intelligent tweet about anything.  Just negative, aggressive, egotistical comments.  And you can’t spell and your truck still leaks oil.

3857 2018-02-20 15:58:20 2) when confronted with an oil spill, whether maritime or pipeline, history shows us that too often an observing EMPLOYEE often calls corporate first and not the government.  Meanwhile precious time is lost while corporate lawyers deliberate response and “handling” the message.

3907 2018-02-20 15:51:40 India needs a future-ready strategy to meet its energy needs. Hoping oil prices will remain low is not a strategy. The country will have the world's largest energy demand growth by the early 2030s, according to the latest BP energy outlook.

3910 2018-02-20 15:51:17 Oh, lemon botol kuning, yang oil control. Welcome! 
3911 2018-02-20 15:50:58 Notley has gone out of her way to destroy every vestige of the oil patch in AB by hiring the likes of Berman, Topp etc. Notley has been anti oil her whole life, and proud of it.  The picture is her truth.
3912 2018-02-20 15:50:57 A bit confused here. Oil was left out of the fiscal plans last time and we were still able to survive. Oil is the unionist’s secret weapon with all the fibs they’ve told.

4048 2018-02-20 15:35:29 How that saying go... Can't slick a can of oil.... or something like that

4053 2018-02-20 15:34:43 Have you ever tried CBD oil Beth? I can't take any painkillers as I react to all of them, so CBD oil has been a frickin' miracle for me.
4054 2018-02-20 15:34:39 || It’s dark as fuck in my apartment and I went to grab a drink.
Waking back to my room only to realise...I just poured myself a nice glass of fucking vegetable oil...

4056 2018-02-20 15:34:30 I think it’s called quid pro quo... Tillerson has done a bad job as SOS and how can we forget his $759B Russian oil deal that has been held up by sanctions? Gutting the sanctions dept?
4057 2018-02-20 15:34:27 The richest black woman in the world isn't Oprah, it's a Nigerian Philanthropist/Oil Tycoon named Folorunsho Alakija.
4058 2018-02-20 15:34:05 They won’t unless the Oil tell us. The rub against Chia and even TMAC is that it is perceived that the oil went oh TMACs available let’s hire him, Chia’s available let’s hire him. Most teams announce they are “looking” and in most cases they let known who they interviewed?
4059 2018-02-20 15:34:01 Congressman:  Ask for a Declaration of War Against Russia if you want Trump to act forcefully.  We can Nuke them tomorrow.  Use Cyber to shut down their country.  Best punishment is Drill Baby Drill to cut oil prices to destroy Russian economy.  Your move!  JM

They have proven they can’t handle guns.... only our side should have them!!!
4065 2018-02-20 15:33:35 Clean energy jobs pay more than oil jobs.
You have endless winter sun, and winds on the prairies.
Temporary foreign workers are paid crap wages and so do crap work. Hundreds of Canadian workers out of a job because of TFWs.

Conclusion: big oil money lining your pockets.

4079 2018-02-20 15:32:47 Thanks for sharing! I got sinus surgery & it did nothing (still mad at my doctor) but TBH at this point I'm open to anything.

Totally understand the Icy Hot. I have the Migrastil Migraine Stick which is basically just peppermint oil, and it's a life saver.
4080 2018-02-20 15:32:35 I support it but when people cry it’s much cleaner and less carbon impact then oil&gas they need to get hit with the truth

4088 2018-02-20 15:31:51 Hey babes, we all just wanna wake up to thick, long eyelashes. Instead of getting expensive eyelash extensions u could make ur eyelashes long and thick at home with just castor oil. Castor oil won’t only make ur eyelashes long and thick it would make them harder to break. Ly

4098 2018-02-20 15:30:24 When OPEC chatters didn't manage to move price lately, you know it's influence over oil is waning... Come on shale.. Say something...

4106 2018-02-20 15:30:02 Isn’t that why Trump put Pruitt in charge to destroy EPA, so all the Big Pollutants, oil, gas, coal, chemical plants can make money! It’s all about money! Who cares if it destroys our environment and poisons people!

4110 2018-02-20 15:29:07 Egypt faces a possible over-abundance of natural gas after 2 Israeli companies proposed a $15 billion supply deal, raising the prospect that the Arab nation may turn its surplus into LNG & export it to a market currently glutted with LNG #Oil #LNG #Israel #Egypt

4130 2018-02-20 15:27:14 Part of the reason for Keystone XL was to 'reuse, recycle' an existing refinery, perfectly suited to refining oil sands oil-why build a new plant here? Think of emissions/materials and expanded GHG footprint of shipping refined product after that. Sea freight cheapest transport.
4131 2018-02-20 15:27:08 They gave them actual tax $ from producing something, oil and they had to balance a budget in doing this.  Are you actually suggesting raising taxes & balancing the budget to do this nationally??  #WSJidots
4132 2018-02-20 15:26:56 seriously don't buy these the oil on ur fingers wears down the gold and they look brown and gross within like a month
4133 2018-02-20 15:26:55 Get the right perspective on that declaration ;by our population we evidently ought to be the biggest economy in volume of transactions. Our major dependency on oil revenue is a fact. Recession was guaranteed  after GEJ ;so much NOI predicted the recession was coming

4141 2018-02-20 15:26:22 just dropped my car off at the shop to get an oil change and never felt so dumb before in my life, WHY DO YOU THINK I KNOW CAR THINGS MR. GARAGE MAN?! my father does these things!!!!
4142 2018-02-20 15:26:17 i looove coconut oil  just bought some pink shampoo too, ty! hahahaha as if you used ketchup man
4143 2018-02-20 15:26:04 Aww fuck, there’s now a pyramid scheme company selling cbd oil 
4144 2018-02-20 15:26:04 アッ！！！！！(体温が上がり過ぎて死亡)
4145 2018-02-20 15:25:52 I would definitely suggest some sort of lube- I'm just using coconut oil and it works just fine but jojoba oil works well too. And they're cheaper than the ear lube at spencers
4146 2018-02-20 15:25:49 Agreed that oil-by-rail numbers are awfully lagged. Some higher frequency data from Association of American Railroads but it isn’t perfect/apples-to-apples comparable.

Mostly following news reports and any uptick implied by falling spreads (cart or horse?)

4149 2018-02-20 15:25:26 Damn Axelrod, you really obsess. Perhaps you should write about Cubs & White Sox baseball for awhile, improve your mental health. Your "salad days" in politics are behind you, Mr Mustachioed snake oil purveyor.
4150 2018-02-20 15:25:21 Already made it the rewind, “peeing oil” made me laugh.
4151 2018-02-20 15:25:17 does JBCO = just basic coconut oil ?!
4152 2018-02-20 15:25:10 So you are telling me that the oil light was on all day?  How did that make you feel?
4153 2018-02-20 15:25:08 Number of incidents of gun violence at your typical NRA convention? Zero.
4154 2018-02-20 15:24:51 Time that economies stopped relying and depending on oil for all its purposes
4155 2018-02-20 15:24:51 Woooooow is there enough space in them tankers for that much oil. B.P must literally be writing you a buy out right now . You absolute mugs 
4156 2018-02-20 15:24:40 I asked her to pick me up while my car getting a oil change. She gone say “Girl bye you shoulda caught me when I was on that side of town. I don’t have any babies” 
4157 2018-02-20 15:24:32 i put exacto knife into the floor it just was cooking oil
4158 2018-02-20 15:24:11 lavender oil has really been a life saver for me
4159 2018-02-20 15:24:04 “I’m a white girl what I’m not like a WHITE girl,” I try to tell myself as I refill my oil diffuser
4160 2018-02-20 15:24:03 Just a thought: All politicians stops accepting donations from the NRA, Planned Parenthood, Big Pharma, labor unions, Wall Street, banks, oil companies & environmental lobbyists. Might help them put representing their constituents first.
4161 2018-02-20 15:23:59 If Ottawa wants Alberta’s oil so bad, maybe they should build the pipeline eastward.
4162 2018-02-20 15:23:51 No, thanks if you aim to drill for oil off my beautiful coast. The chance of a spill is 100%. I will ride my bike instead so we can have less reliance on oil PERIOD.
4163 2018-02-20 15:23:50 Yes it is very popular. After anaerobic digestion is complete, the digest is often offered as a fertilising agent - how ever much or how ever small the oil-based plastic has biodegraded to, it then gets put on land. A ban on all single use oil based plastic would be a start :)
4164 2018-02-20 15:23:48 ~nakaka t a e ang castor oil~ if masakit tyan mo and gusto mo ma-tae, go na ma hahaha
4165 2018-02-20 15:23:39 Do what he should have done from the beginning by explaining to the country how his party came up with the solution of a carbon tax and how important it was to get the oil companies on side.
4166 2018-02-20 15:23:27 Dry skin! Get some baby oil into your bath.
4167 2018-02-20 15:23:21 #UKOG wow! Feel for holders who bought into the hype, just about producing enough oil to light a candle . . . .
4168 2018-02-20 15:23:19 It's probably not a good thing when the light at the end of the tunnel is a train. Do you watch any proxy indicators for oil-by-rail? The NEB/EIA data seems pretty infrequent (forgive me for all the questions, it's not an area I understand well!)
4169 2018-02-20 15:23:18 I recently got oil paints so I mean the obvious first thing to use them on is a Bob Ross paint-along
4170 2018-02-20 15:23:10 They will be designated our enemy, as ISIS has been not for the atrocities they commit, but as an excuse to steal their Oil.

I think, as you can see on my pinned tweet, on my profile, who our REAL enemies are.

But those 3 are on the same side as the NWO who want all the Oil.
4171 2018-02-20 15:23:05 So why didn't SLAB do anything when in power? They held WM as well and Scotland had the poorest constituencies in Europe. Glasgow had slums that would have shamed a third world country in the 70/80s during the oil boom. Labour are full of it.
4172 2018-02-20 15:23:00 ive been doing this shitty oil painting for so long now and i still havent even finished half of it and it shouldve been finished a month ago i hate this so much
4173 2018-02-20 15:22:52 " At least our industry is now putting some effort into dispelling the myths." Oh? Story for you: I asked a CKNW producer (I'm regularly interviewed re oil/gas, pipelines) why he didn't have CAPP on talk radio. Him: What's a CAPP? Industry NEVER shows its face in Vancouver.
4174 2018-02-20 15:22:43 Oh man... those are handmade stuffed Italian cherry peppers in stuffed with salami, prosciutto, & provolone cheese packed in an olive oil & other secret ingredients marinade... so... what they are is #defuckinlicious .
4175 2018-02-20 15:22:30 I love it! I just fear that it isn't enough. We need to cut our ties with oil and natural gas. These models show that it is possible to live well and live small, but too few people hear of it.
4176 2018-02-20 15:22:27 In actual sense total Eco size is approx 995 billion and out of which we spend 930 billion for oil and gas import and reminder goes for the development and running the country . 2.439 tr is the size of the Nominal Eco . Some way you are right but factually what I said
4177 2018-02-20 15:22:17 According to Rainforest Rescue, 90 percent of the world’s palm oil is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia. Between 2011 and 2012, 8,000 square miles of forest was cleared in Indonesia, mainly for palm oil production.  #deforestation #orangutan #elephants #palmoil 
4178 2018-02-20 15:22:10 That began long ago and Hillary would have allowed it to continue. 

Name ONE POLICY where Hill earned my vote over STEIN?

Why did DNC steer ALL money and promotion toward Hillary and push media blackout of Bernie?

Do you know WHY the MIC wants war w Rus? 

OIL SYRIA PIPELINE
4179 2018-02-20 15:22:05 Sad representation for Louisiana.  trump administration including Pruitt (who is owned by the oil companies) getting rid of all regulations that protect the coastlines from oil spills.  You are going to need a lot of royalties to pay for the catastrophes that are coming.
4180 2018-02-20 15:21:59 Are people panic buying again? I’ve seen about four people today with huge stashes of sugar, cooking oil etc.
4181 2018-02-20 15:21:50 What about Big oil. Sueing them ? We're putting our homes that we don't have in our gas tanks ! Bc your in wonderland!
4182 2018-02-20 15:21:31 We have to phase out oil use in Canada, quite rapidly. Even conservative economists show that the cost is reasonable, involving already commercial technologies and energy forms - creating a lot of jobs and helping our kids and grandkids.
4183 2018-02-20 15:21:06 Does oil's petrochemical use cause the same amount of GHG emissions as ICE combustion?
4184 2018-02-20 15:21:01 Venezuela's oil backed cryptocurrency has launched. Akin to a govt bond backed by oil reserves, but Russia and China have already prepaid for a billion barrels and the state owned petro company is on the verge of failing. Wonder what US regulators will do.

4198 2018-02-20 15:18:58 The inflation was caused by the Barbour boom which lagged 2 years into 1975 and by the OPEC restriction on Petrol Production. Global clearing of Oil is in USD. So external cost pressure pushed prices up. We are not sovereign in Dollars.

Palm oil is driving orangutans and other endangered species to extinction , the industry is riddled with human rights abuses and on top of that palm oil is bad for your health as well.

Was it when you asked Putin twice if he meddled then told us all he didn’t?

Was it when you ignored Russia sneaking oil to NK?

Was it after Russian troops attacked our troops in Syria?

Bottom line, scraping your teeth on Putin’s dick doesn’t count as being tough.

4418 2018-02-20 14:52:04 But in studying this mitzvah and drawing correlations to other things He told us to do, we understand that God wants certain things to remain separate. Certain things are never meant to be mixed. Oil and water, bleach and ammonia, etc.

4464 2018-02-20 14:46:54 So drilling for NG is ok but oil is not? No difference between the two. Drilling is drilling anyway you slice it up.
4465 2018-02-20 14:46:54 Wow! I'd guess many of those things were attempts to address the oil leakage. I recall c. 30 years ago Museum of Wales, Cardiff used specialist leather conservators to solve a similar problem with their giant Harlech specimen.
4466 2018-02-20 14:46:53 Okay oh, already doing that( mixed with coconut oil and carrot oil), I believe it's genetic, you either have, or  you don't.

4471 2018-02-20 14:46:22 #whiston theft of oil from a property on Castle Ashby road. Happened on the 16th Feb. Any info call 101. Crime reference number 18000080983.
4472 2018-02-20 14:46:16 Woke up late and thought I had a test which meant I have to sit through 2 hrs of traffic. So in a state of panic I put on @josie_maran argan oil so I could at least do some of my morning skincare routine.

I guess it worked since I got a compliment about my glowing skin 
4473 2018-02-20 14:46:07 I bought new sponges and dish soap for the office kitchen, put them out yesterday, and this morning I came in to find that someone from the work crew used the sponges to wash engine oil off their hands, and wasted a ton of the soap. I don't know if I've ever been this angry.
4474 2018-02-20 14:45:54 Yes! I was thinking the same thing.  Food stamps are better! No real cost.  People can, for instance, get foods w/o peanut oil.  People/families have different needs and the food stamps are PERFECT! So why fix it when it isn't broken?
4475 2018-02-20 14:45:44 How much money do you make selling this snake oil?  Do you ever feel guilty for shilling for someone who may be headed for the deepest ignominy since WW II?
4476 2018-02-20 14:45:37 Considering they have not managed to find any more big oil wells for a long, long time, hence why there is tar sand, I think they are only happy if there is a ban on plastic production since oil is used to power up civilization as a whole and they rather use it on that I bet.

4605 2018-02-20 14:30:00 Oh you, Mr Fish Finger, got a huge pan filled with hot oil.
4606 2018-02-20 14:29:58 Gimme some oil instead
4607 2018-02-20 14:29:56 History will remember, there was a country which killed millions of children just for oil and control.

4609 2018-02-20 14:29:34 But he would’ve gotten more exercise if he’d gone to The Shire to get the hobbits to do it. (Already saw myself out.  )
4610 2018-02-20 14:29:04 That's what I thought! But you couldn't do that if you were like, roaming in the apocalypse. You'd have to have a stable home base I think in order to make oil? Or trade for it, but the traders would know exactly what you're doing with it. I thought about this a lot.
4611 2018-02-20 14:29:01 Appear to shove all of Scotland's oil into a great big tanker.
Run around getting chased by mental Yoons until its miles away from the real fuel (sneaked away inside camper vans).
Oh, the look on their faces once they find out they've been had.
Use oil to negotiate good EU deal.

4613 2018-02-20 14:28:52 Market access is huge, but the overall framework of the CLP and the feds price on pollution has driven $ elesewhere. I actually sit with people who make capital allocations and that’s what they tell me. Not short cycle (fracing) vs. Long cycle (oil sands). It’s the governments.

4617 2018-02-20 14:27:40 There are "studies" to back all arguments made by big oil thanks to their very deep pockets
Thanks but I get all the propaganda I need right here on twitter

I don't need "evidence" because I know for a fact that most of the worlds oil is crude oil right from the ground
4618 2018-02-20 14:27:39 No, by abiotic I mean that there are nutters who think that oil is generated by lava in the earths mantle and not by long term decomposition of organisms.
4619 2018-02-20 14:27:24 Oh yeah, I'd like to get my oil in THAT phallic engine!

More than 10 times the price of a barrel of oil. Yes OIL.
4651 2018-02-20 14:22:37 Lol i am not even living in Pakistan. Pakistan electricity generation was never a problem it was just they cant afford oil price. Circular debt is again on same 2013 level. So this summer you guys are going to NJOY.
4652 2018-02-20 14:22:33 @BJWilsonWGR pro style oil patterns LITERALLY have a 2-3 board wide target you have to hit or else you'll miss the pocket and split.
4653 2018-02-20 14:22:28 Nothing to do with it. France, on this measure, was asset rich as well, having confiscated valuable church property. Church farmland was an important asset in an agricultural economy, just as oil is today for a modern economy. Fact is both governments were and are broke.
4654 2018-02-20 14:22:16 Greenpeace is opposed to the expansion of oil infrastructure EVERYWHERE

The tar sands is the biggest, dirtiest and most energy intensive, so they get more attention

4675 2018-02-20 14:19:26 Oil and gas continue to receive large tax breaks (=subsidy).

Renewables have used subsidies to develop the technology.

The UKs first £0 subsidy solar & wind farms are now coming on line.
Commercial operation. No subsidy. 

Why can't big oil do the same?

4752 2018-02-20 14:11:31 Yes. Most of the products are not stocked in all sizes/quantities eg you can find kimbo cooking oil 3ltrs, 1ltr but no 5ltr.
4753 2018-02-20 14:11:27 Not sure if you understood the question. Ask is does a carbon emission reduce or stop just cause it will be say 2℅ more expensive. Asking on lines of what Denmark keeps doing. May be their whole country cycles but they continue to drill oil close to sensitive polar region.
4754 2018-02-20 14:11:26 Thank you Sassy! May be I'll make such work by oil

4756 2018-02-20 14:11:05 The Arctic, onshore and offshore, contains vital energy resources that can reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve the national balance of payments.

4758 2018-02-20 14:11:00 Sadly true. As the means to support today’s standard of living declines, the US will be flipping our discounted crude oil to China for a profit and the climate will be worse off, not better, and Jaccard will have his indexed public pension.
4759 2018-02-20 14:10:59 The people who flipped to liking this "big" awful tax cut have the same thought process of someone who says "look how much money I save by no longer changing the oil in my car!"

Short term gains (bribes to not think critically, really) that will explode into long term cost.

4764 2018-02-20 14:10:16 Well, if the both would stop pouring oil on troubled waters, sit at the table, have an adult debate, and FIND A SOLUTION in which the demands of both or somehow met then things would maybe move.  We can expect that or should from our elected leaders no?  Damn #kindergarten

4768 2018-02-20 14:09:49 Conversations you don’t think you’ll have: asking the dude in @HobgoblinMusic how to remove Exorcist-style pea soup from one’s instrument (lovely folks in there). Where do I get tea tree oil?

4773 2018-02-20 14:09:28 At this rate climate change, drought, flood, rise in oil prices, panda extinction, trump being the us president, thanos outbeating the avenger ass, YG BALDING,...it all happened bcos of ikonic

"But mummy, I'm hungry!"

"Well kid, we were gonna share that ready meal I spotted for £2.50, but on Phil's advice I got the oil instead. So it's a shot of that, or wait and see what tomorrow brings I guess."

4783 2018-02-20 14:08:24 @AamAadmiParty So, does plastic sink back into the earth, separating the zinc, lead and chlorides as it goes down back into the mineral oil table? My experience says it does, tho’ it does do a lot of temporary damage to plants, the water table and soil on the way.

4791 2018-02-20 14:07:42 I'm busy running around trying to pump all the oil like an out of mother earth BABY! It's like handing the keys to the vault to a bunch of Republicans.. oh, we did.
4792 2018-02-20 14:07:34 That sounds as plausible as 13 Russian trolls derailing Hillary's well oil political machine by posting mean memes on Facebook. It's a wonder that the old USSR lost the Cold War.

4802 2018-02-20 14:06:29 Working out just as you would expect. Outspoken bigotry, guns everywhere, Russians in our business, public lands sold to big oil, gas, mining, ect ect ect...
4803 2018-02-20 14:06:26 Hard to follow this reasoning?! If mineral/land owners continue to benefit from the oil development I would assume the oil companies will also continue to benefit? Oil companies benefit so do the state coffers & all of our communities?
4804 2018-02-20 14:06:20 General Nutrition Tips #GNT :

4880 2018-02-20 13:56:06 feeling a bit smug with the heating oil delivery the week before the cold weather - all you on mains (water, sewage, gas etc) should never take it for granted
4881 2018-02-20 13:56:01 That’s fine but a free trade Canada with no borders should go both ways, the oil province need to get their product to market then it works for all of Canada one way or another your going to have tankers on your coast if western oil shuts the taps off to bc oil u still need it

It’s a disaster, hence the ongoing delay in the SNP showing Scotland their new ‘case’ for separation. They know it’s unsellable.

Sheikh Mansour is still alive, having been preserved through mystical middle eastern oil sorcery

Man City FC is a global superpower, buying Amazon, Google and Microsoft in a single week without breaching FFP, just to annoy the rags

Wigan still beat us in the FA cup
5018 2018-02-20 13:34:57 Okay, could. But even with >$100 oil rating could be between A and Baa, not Aa1. Basing an economy on a volatile commodity is foolish; basing an economy on a volatile economy while telling people you're not doing so is extremely foolish.

Bush/Cheney tried to sell us that Iraq would welcome us w/ open arms & their oil would pay for the war, not a single penny have we received, US taxpayers paid for his unlawful war. Bush warning means nothing after creating it.

5094 2018-02-20 13:26:28 The bill is shocking when it comes - also numbing. We got all the characters in a rush the first 4 minutes of our meal. Overall it’s the first character meal I would not recommend doing again, and maybe not even once.  Unless perhaps you are an oil baron.
5095 2018-02-20 13:26:12 I ran out of jelly last night and it must've messed with me a lot more than I thought because I really internalized it. So last night I had a dream that I was cleaning up an oil spill-esque situation, but it was jelly. And the whole time @runawaybrother was cheering me on.

5113 2018-02-20 13:23:28 This is simply more apologetics for the oil industry.  Canada has to take a leadership role and meet our commitments to the Paris climate agreement.  The tar sands has to contract 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.  That's in our national interest.

Rubbing the interior with oil for instance? Any guidance appreciated and I can’t waiting for Buffering to ask!
5116 2018-02-20 13:22:54 I would say in the middle! The body cleanser is more like an oil and the lotion is more like an actual lotion but it isn't too thick

5118 2018-02-20 13:22:21 I thin you’re making that up in your head and actually believe it.

Tax bracket percentages were lowered, standard deductions were doubled, child care tax credits were doubled...

Price of gas has everything to do with the oil supply and nothing to do with Trump
5119 2018-02-20 13:21:59 You got paid to think you were keeping ‘global democracy’ when in reality you were just protecting the interests of elite’s. protecting oil fields and so on and fighting a mercenary religious proped up army made by the CIA. Go and cry to your family about how brave you were.
5120 2018-02-20 13:21:50 Soros has been investing in oil companies since the beginning

5297 2018-02-20 12:58:01 Not to start drawing on conspiracies but i feel the supply shortages are artifically imposed by manufacturers so that customers get fed up with delays and buy an oil burner instead
5298 2018-02-20 12:57:50 Vast swathes of eons-old rainforest, esp. in Malaysia & Indonesia, have been destroyed to grow palm oil trees for oil profits. Land then depleted, left barren.

5321 2018-02-20 12:54:29 Pennsylvania average is currently $2.83/gal. If oil prices remain supported, price at pump should drift higher - $3/gal is not beyond the realms of possibility. Sorry!
5322 2018-02-20 12:54:19 We all know what your sorry ass would have done had he mentioned Russia's obvious support of your candidacy. Only the Dumb among us are buying the snake oil you are selling.
5323 2018-02-20 12:54:16 FYI

That will do more damage to muh Russia than any sanction ever could

5328 2018-02-20 12:53:41 hey baby anon -- Rex ran the world's largest oil company so comparing him to a movie star seems off track.
5329 2018-02-20 12:53:34 BP Energy Outlook out this afternoon. The headlines should (but won't) read 'oil major expects to see climate crisis unleashed'.
5330 2018-02-20 12:53:13 It's obvious why their so mad. Free, cheap, clean energy is for suckers. They want to be oil dependent like the all the great nations of the world.
5331 2018-02-20 12:52:24 Germany benefits from not being a free market capitalist state. It uses regulation to stabilise its economy. It's a social market economy.

Norway has that fund because of its oil. Sweden has less terrorism than Britain.

Nordic countries have the highest living standards.

5335 2018-02-20 12:51:51 @jamieoliver Your restaurants were the Emperor's new clothes - open a jar, pour on some olive oil (branded by you), flash it under a grill, toss a salad and serve. No cooking, at max prices. Restaurants are full, nothing to do with Brexit.

5365 2018-02-20 12:47:25 @MorningBlend969  I just love how @muddasick presents his ignorance.  To suggest we had a safe operating oil refinery company is nonsense.  Between 1970-85, BORCO spilled over 4 billion gallons of oil into our environment, recovered only 75%.
5366 2018-02-20 12:47:25 Wouldn't you agree it was the best game to play at that time? What do you do when you had neither economic or hard power back then? Eg- India has massively reduced oil imports from Iran in retaliation to Farzad-B now.

5377 2018-02-20 12:46:25 It was the music more than anything. It's engine oil - why such a melancholy thing?

5379 2018-02-20 12:46:14 @VOCMOpenline the present gas reserves of the operating wells is a strategic component of the oil recovery, all those increased recoverable oil numbers is based on having the gas available... It's not as simple as sitting on it.
5380 2018-02-20 12:46:13 @Lululushmodel2 yes darling I'd love to rub olive oil over your body and your tits and your ass
5381 2018-02-20 12:46:13 Good, this farming is so dangerous to the ecology and negative results are just beginning to be noticed. Just like oil pipelines, there’s always weak spots causing a leak to which the ecological damage is outweighed by their products.
5382 2018-02-20 12:46:09 it pedals so much easier now all the oil has been cleaned off…

5395 2018-02-20 12:44:06 Probably making the drought too. But republicans think they don’t need water as long as they have oil and money. It won’t end well.
5396 2018-02-20 12:44:01 Did you know olives have an effect on your appetite? Olive oil contains a compound called oleocanthals, which binds with digestive receptors and reduces appetite. This is actually a healthy way of losing weight if you are not the one who would exercise regularly.
5397 2018-02-20 12:43:50 Once upon a time Libya use to offer jobs for many westerners in their oil fields + harbored many African migrants then after the American intervention the Libyans themselves started leaving the country let alone giving others jobs and shelter . #just_saying

5402 2018-02-20 12:43:23 #Venezuela shunned by the US and the West becomes first the nation to recogniize the use of 'Petro' crypto-currency. A barrel of crude oil is equivalent to a Petro currency. Very few believe this Communist mismanaged and capitalist shunned nation can revive this way.
5403 2018-02-20 12:43:12 Passing some advice along that helped me a lot: a spoonful of coconut oil apparently tricks your brain into thinking it's eating sugar, easing any cravings.

5408 2018-02-20 12:42:49 SaftyTipTues: The safety culture of the oil & gas industry, with multiple contractors on every site, is one of shared responsibility. With that comes awareness & dedication to your own company's culture. You are responsible for your own safety, but keep a keen eye around you.

5440 2018-02-20 12:38:01 You can use olive oil to remove car grease from your hands. Simply make a mixture of 1 teaspoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt or sugar, and rub it into your hands, palms  and between your fingers for couple of minutes. Rinse it off to get cleaner, softer hands.

Can't u do the simple calculation to workout the income??  

20% of £15.5bn = £3.1bn would be the income. A very large sum which was OMITED from GERS hence why it is not accurate!

To maximise the potential of OEO in commercial livestock production, 2 factors are key: 1) oil should be natural 2) the composition of oil used should be standardised. OEO is more than just thymol and carvacrol.

"Beautiful way to start your day before going into the oil field. Very American"
6002 2018-02-20 10:56:54 Do you mean to sprinkle soya oil on roads?  Won't it be costly?
6003 2018-02-20 10:56:53 Also washing up liquid and bicarbonate of soda too! You should get a hot oil treatment from Lush, olaplex or some coconut oil once you’ve stripped it to help with the damage too!!
6004 2018-02-20 10:56:22 There are big differences, sure. But American oil companies benefit from  state patronage and the revolving door constantly. Is it not a difference in degree?

It's based on ONS data(WM controlled) & doesn't  give holistic info on tax & spend. Eg: last year it we found oil barreled at sea isn't attributed to Sco eco, that was £15bn over 2 years = £3bn omitted from our accounts!

6068 2018-02-20 10:41:17 @ErikSTownsend what’s your opinion: if oil goes down, won’t the Fed magically say there’s a risk of deflation again and then hold off with further rate hikes, thereby exacerbating the rally in equities?

6544 2018-02-20 08:56:00 Scottish GDP is not reliant on oil. If we taxed oil companies in a similar way as Norway,oil will always be beneficial to our economy. Me might even have a oil fund. Yes all that renewable energy, fish,whisky,gin,finance,farming,fresh GM free produce makes us fiscally prudent.

6719 2018-02-20 08:15:07 NATO’s military intervention may have been a resounding success for America’s military elite and oil companies but for the ordinary Libyan, the military campaign may indeed go down in history as one of the greatest failures of the 21st century.

6958 2018-02-20 07:25:48 Please, does condensate sell for the same price  as oil?

*understand

Every factory owner knows the imperative of scheduled maintenance and the destructiveness of deferred maintenance.

Even the most basic machine care is a regular drop of oil
6973 2018-02-20 07:23:15 Let's see: 

You voted straight (D) and "Yes" on all bond measures, tax increases and social welfare.  If in Cali. you voted for the guns and ammo. restrictions and you support "Sanctuary" status.  

You oppose oil and nuke plants and blame "greedy" corps. for high energy prices.

6987 2018-02-20 07:19:36 Talk about it doesn't change something about the trueness. :) But Moscowian propaganda has changed the view point in the free world. Oil and dictatorships is a question, how you can create wealth not with free, but dependent people.
6988 2018-02-20 07:19:35 Precisely. You can't tell us apart. In any case, all 4 of my grandparents were born in Northern India.

6990 2018-02-20 07:18:57 @drjasonfung Hi Jason, is it optimal to eat daily protein intake in one meal during IF (for me that's 22/2) as insulin will only be raised once? Then if feeling hungry during fast then would a small mct/coconut oil coffee(given their non insulin response)not stall autophagy?
6991 2018-02-20 07:18:54 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
6992 2018-02-20 07:18:42 Sheet masks - twice a week. Cleanser, Tone with a nonalcoholic toner (Thayers is pretty good), Serum, Moisturizer. If you have some free time at home - luxuriate in some face oil. At night, a nice thick cream does wonders, like Nivea (apparently German produced Nivea is the best)
6993 2018-02-20 07:18:31 Wait for spring.  Some say that you should wash your hair every day, others say you definitely should not wash you hair too often to combat dry/flaky scalp. I've heard that a scalp massage using olive oil might help.

7103 2018-02-20 06:55:18 CIA uses the word contractor for its black military ops mostly for scouting natural resourcers, oil gas rare earths and fresh water. Absolutely Certain Russias' contractors are retired or active spooks too.
7104 2018-02-20 06:55:15 @Deuce9lives I want you to cover me in oil after I cover you. I want you to massage me and rub me.
7105 2018-02-20 06:54:49 Yeah, it dries your skin up by shutting down the oil glands and I also suffered from fatigue whilst taking it. It was well worth it though after years of struggling on other lotions, creams and pills that just didn’t work.

7112 2018-02-20 06:52:58 I always find it amusing when people argue that we need to stop using oil. While I wholeheartedly agree with that, I'm also calm in my thinking that means end of life as we know it because civilization runs on oil and I think most forget this.

7240 2018-02-20 06:21:22 My dad taught me never to depend on a man and I’m so thankful. I can change my own oil and fix things around the house. I have a wonderful husband who does most of it for me, but I don’t NEED him too.

7242 2018-02-20 06:21:20 I actually agree that April is likely. Stock Market will collapse if the US$ loses faith, and one way to do that is through losing control of the oil markets. China Petro futures are launching end of March!!! Could play an effect! #petroyuan
7243 2018-02-20 06:21:18 @VinnieTortorich just listened to a few minutes of "The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss" OMG what absolute BS.. He (a Dr.) says that sugar does not turn into fat and that fat (like olive oil) does not satisfy hunger and causes you to be fat. Seriously, how is this sold?
7244 2018-02-20 06:21:03 ไม่ง่วงกันเหรอคะ
7245 2018-02-20 06:20:59 Most of Cherry Point's crude oil is from the Alaska North Slope. It is brought in by petroleum tankers via the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Rosario Strait and delivered directly of Georgia... The remainder of the crude comes from a pipeline connected to reserves in Western Canada.
7246 2018-02-20 06:20:58 This campaign by Sierra Club is deeply flawed in its messaging. It’s a leftover from its partnership on nat gas and oil. Really please drop it and move to Beyond Fossil Fuels. Coal plants are being closed and new nat gas plants opened.
7247 2018-02-20 06:20:49 Maybe because higher quality animal fats (ghee, tallow, lard, butter) & fruit fats (EVOO & avocado oil)
7248 2018-02-20 06:20:29 And the other part is paid for by companies that live off the fringes of oil and gas.
7249 2018-02-20 06:20:02 #IOC will invest Rs 70,000 crore to raise its oil refining capacity by about a quarter by 2030 as it takes the lead to meet rising energy needs of the country.

7254 2018-02-20 06:19:08 I'll keep retweeting the jobs that exist NOT in oil which is a losing proposition. Not like fisheries are going to gobble up anyone else's job or load up stacked deck of foreign monied bought politicos. That's what big oil does.

7265 2018-02-20 06:17:30 I can assure you I am no socialist.  More free market economist and libertarian if you prescribe anything on me.  My observation is that the US stance against Venezuela has merely pushed this agenda as a consequence.  Venezuela has largest oil reserves.
7266 2018-02-20 06:17:30 Ba ha ha - please present your data on mining, oil and gas subsidies and show me where green energy is economic without subsidies. Also will you be willing to fly across Canada on an electric plane? I’ll buy your ticket!

7271 2018-02-20 06:16:41 Put it to vote . Stupid politicians. Always fucking up the economy.  Led by the silent majority. Do the right thing and bring the pipeline. Also send the pipeline east ! Rather than import oil from other countries.  Why bolster other economies ?

But how would the free market work for long term benefit at the cost of short term gain? Ex- oil vs climate?

7299 2018-02-20 06:10:49 Advice for getting rid of skin tags or really just getting rid of nearly anything: Tea tree oil. Lots of places tell you to dilute it but nah, don't do that. Will it dry out your skin? Ye. But it will ALSO get rid of tags and zits and sometimes scars if you apply it often enough.

7311 2018-02-20 06:07:43 From the Chinese Communications Office: An oil spill from an Iranian tanker has left 136,000 tons of oil in the East China Sea. China has recruited Japan for clean up so they won't be effected by the oil.

7315 2018-02-20 06:06:44 In the past, Russian business ties have done much to assist Trump's bottom line. Rex Tillerson was with ExxonMobil.

7328 2018-02-20 06:04:35 Oil prices fell no more for those at the bottom than those at the top, and I'm pretty sure they use the same deflator for both. So yeah, yay for falling oil prices, but when inequality declines that's worth celebrating.

7338 2018-02-20 06:02:30 Maybe; but I think the higher inflation (incl. higher oil prices), lower bond demands & US economy will force BOC to raise rates a few times this year so similar to mortgage stress test, OSFI should start monitoring more closely HELOC exposure/usages before future rate hikes.

7377 2018-02-20 05:56:59 Amen. The chemicals used to create the scents in laundry products are really difficult to get rid of in washers and dryers, once they are there. Certain orange oil based cleaners can get them out over time--but then you have to wait for the orange oil to dissipate as well!

7391 2018-02-20 05:52:57 I cooked hamburgers at a Micky D's in the 1970s and there was no oil involved there either.  There was sufficient fat in the ground beef to cook on a hot plate without sticking...

7428 2018-02-20 05:46:44 The mild level of reporting abt #Pep just goes to show how much oil money has been used grease the #FA and the media. Only way for d FA to be forced into acting is continuous social media posts. #Pep wondering how 2 answer d sheikh now after spending so much

Why does Russia want to help them? @maddow
7434 2018-02-20 05:46:13 3)Ensure you wear loose fitting clothing and avoid other activities that may cause friction or irritation to the area

My viewpoint is oil/gas is going to be used for next 30+ yrs even with Paris agreement. If you fill the wells this is to your benefit
7498 2018-02-20 05:31:21 No it’s for overall, I just use it on my problem spots, because the oil is so concentrated. You can buy diluted oil. Moisturizer after these oils are the key tho they work hand in hand. I got a baby soft non oily face.
7499 2018-02-20 05:30:59 Carter was useless. Clinton was and still remains a con artist. Bush 2 straddled the fence and allowed his VP and friends become rich from war times.

7524 2018-02-20 05:24:51 Always Falsehood. REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa and see true innovations without Foriegn aids or continue to steal oil with the help of jihadist.
7525 2018-02-20 05:24:40 I love cooking my steak with mushrooms and onions without oil f you oil!

7529 2018-02-20 05:23:42 Important point! I would also like to add the risks with inhalation of oilmist or oil smoke at work. Same sized particles as PM2.5 and PM1.0. Levels often multiple higher.

7533 2018-02-20 05:22:50 1. I vote to the old one because of the environment style. 2. There is a tendency to overpolish things in art. I have the same experience with oil paint. 3. Test the new design in the environment so you can compare the feeling.
7534 2018-02-20 05:22:31 They fix iphones, cut grass, change oil. You really don't have to leave the house with Amazon.
7535 2018-02-20 05:22:29 I was thinking an android getting its oil changed manually but sure I'll go with that one
7536 2018-02-20 05:22:26 Why do the "pro pipeline" voices always resort to the argument that Westcoasters use oil. Of course we do. Just like you breathe clean air.

Anti-pipeline proponents never claim they don't use oil. They simply don't want it pouring into coastal waters or shipped overseas.
7537 2018-02-20 05:22:21 Noah a moter pad is slow as heck have you driven one its like a scooter motorcycles are fast because they have a big battery and lots of gas and oil the power inside it is like a car but with a loud engine and tons of energy the miles are pretty good I have a harley 3 years old

7540 2018-02-20 05:21:50 He is a daily wage  looter with GOI and oil companies
Ril + GOI + oil cos = RS. 78 for petrol
Ril keeps 10% more margin
GOI Rob's / tax's it's citizens with more than 60%
Oil cos are managed poorly
Nepal buys petrol from us and sells for RS. 57 today ie 21 rupees less than us
7541 2018-02-20 05:21:39 They frieghter uses oil for fuel, so if it goes down it releases more than just vegetables. Best to be safe and not run anything that uses fuel. Sailboats will suffice. The refrigerant also uses chemicals, so better to be safe and not have that either.
7542 2018-02-20 05:21:36 I’m in the Oil and Gas industry and this lack of pipe to foreign markets is seriously hurting our AB economy, I’m for Boycotting all of BC products, time for Canada to step up!

7544 2018-02-20 05:21:26 That's because Greenpeace is being paid to sabotage Canada's oil industry, not anyone elses's.
7545 2018-02-20 05:20:18 I made this pizza with Tofu cubes and button mushrooms over Mozzarella and called it 'Buffalo Cracker' because it also has Zaatar and olive oil on cracker crust.

7559 2018-02-20 05:17:47 Excellent suggestion @FloydShivambu re: the sovereign wealth fund. Norway (population 5,2 million) has a $1 trillion fund. They didn't squander their oil and gas money. That money funds arguably the best social security system in human history.
7560 2018-02-20 05:17:32 Black seed oil back in rotation..

7570 2018-02-20 05:16:03 Kenapa nak kena sapu vaseline? Kalau double cleansing tu kita setakat guna micellar water atau cleansing oil utk dissolve the oils/makeup/sunblock, diikuti dgn water-based cleanser utk cuci balik semua residue.

7572 2018-02-20 05:15:46 Mix 9 tsps chick peas with 9 oz eggs. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with salmon
7573 2018-02-20 05:15:44 How many jobs is Alberta losing by not refining oil? Like BC's insistence on shipping raw logs, by settling for the quick buck, we all lose in the long run. I am will pay more for anything Canadian, such as Alberta beef and BC wine...but why aren't we refining our own oil?

7583 2018-02-20 05:14:10 Bill Nye came to Jasper dark skies and told lies about the oil sands. I saw him as an idol until then and was just stunned that he would share such a tainted narrative, especially to an Alberta crowd that paid good money to see him.
7584 2018-02-20 05:14:08 Try putting coconut oil on a cotton ball & wipe it on your lashes. It works for me & I use waterproof makeup so 
7585 2018-02-20 05:14:06 Baby oil/coconut oil or really any oil that won’t irritate your eyes will take off ANY eye makeup waterproof or not
7586 2018-02-20 05:14:00 確か、普通に使用していた場合（シビアコンディションでなければ）、オイル交換時にOILの表示が出てきて、促してくれたと思います。少なくとも、125の取説にはそう書いていましたよ。Vベルトも同様だったと思います。交換時に表示のリセットをお忘れなく！

7592 2018-02-20 05:13:24 Struggling to grasp as to just why B.C so passionately wishes to cripple Alberta's already damaged economy. The Kinder Morgan pipeline is paramount to the creation of more jobs in our province whose entire sustenance predominantly runs on oil.

7608 2018-02-20 05:10:17 But doesn't Quebec take billions from Alberta in equalization payments? Are you happier with oil tankers? Did you read up on their emissions? Quebec imports lots of oil. YOur carbon footprint is bigger because of it vs local production. What's a good analogy for that? Nose/face?
7609 2018-02-20 05:10:11 So let me get this straight: You want people to unfollow them because their message is basically: "Eat real food, avoid processed crap and inflammatory veg. oil. It leads to far better outcomes than eating a crappy diet sprinkled with statins".

7610 2018-02-20 05:09:42 Silly comment. How does either party control the price of oil? I’m asking if the NDP has done something since no party can take credit for the price of oil.

7640 2018-02-20 05:04:39 No,  drilling for oil causes sink holes, earthquakes, pollution & is out dated source of energy. Oil industry should be more conservative when it comes to removing what rightfully belongs to earth. Global warming is real. Civilized countries are moving towards alternative fuels.
7641 2018-02-20 05:04:32 Typical @bcliberals logic. The BC and Canadian economy are on fire at precisely the time that the Oil / Gas sector is not. It is a myth that the O/G sector is anything other than a bystander in the BC and Canadian economy. It's time to diversify for the 21st century

We don't know what happens to diluted bitumen if it spills in the ocean and we have no way to clean it up if it does. Risk everything for what? So a US oil company can increase it's profit margins?

7669 2018-02-20 04:59:36 Btw - back in November, the Keystone Pipeline leaked over 200K gallons of oil onto South Dakota.  This was exactly the kind of accident the protestors of these pipelines warned us about.

7675 2018-02-20 04:58:16 What is your point? This article, while arguing that dilbit won’t sink, also agrees that an oil spill of any kind is a catastrophic event. Increased tanker traffic = increased risk of a spill. So, no thanks. It’s already bad enough
7676 2018-02-20 04:58:16 Green peace!  American money given to protesters to block Canadian oil from making it to market.
7677 2018-02-20 04:58:02 World oil consumption is forecast to rise to 120 mm/b/d by 2040.  Importing at world $ and exporting at discounted $ is costing Canadians $B
7678 2018-02-20 04:57:40 This surely represents trump and what he does and what he is hiding, including his tax returns, which show most of trump income comes from oil deals with russia.

7693 2018-02-20 04:55:32 Yup. And since oil went $60/barrel, there has been alot of tanker cars on the rails lately. #WestCdnAg Its crucial we get more pipeline capacity up here.  If Canada produces another record crop for #plant18 and oil continues to rise, grain shipments will suffer.  #cdnag #cdnpoli

7815 2018-02-20 04:36:01 If it can pull it off by 2050 they will have a nail in their coffin. Oil companies sell their most prized possessions for pennies.

7818 2018-02-20 04:35:53 It's Presidents Day, and I celebrate privately. I would appreciate some space while I study these oil paintings of a young Rutherford B. Hayes.
7819 2018-02-20 04:35:40 The dirty oil industry wants to continue interfering with governments &their people. Down with the dirty fossil fuels &welcome 2renewable energy resources. While they keep creating chaos the oil industry is investing in renewables. They know that those are the future!
7820 2018-02-20 04:35:35 Would express an immense amount of gratitude towards the person who would gift me beard oil. Is that still a thing?

7824 2018-02-20 04:35:17 I really want to try cbd oil for the pain I’m always in, but I’m terrified of getting high. Idk if it gets you high or not, but I’m scared that it might lol I’m deathly afraid of being drunk or high

7826 2018-02-20 04:34:44 They can think that. However scientific evidence to support that claim is lacking. Not keeping score and “main steaming” does not encourage  a child to excel and do well.Also, the fee healthcare, college, among other things Norwegians enjoy is funded by oil and not by taxpayers.
7827 2018-02-20 04:34:43 Gemara explains:
Rav: Daniel placed the prohibition of gentile oil on his heart, and also instructed other Jews to follow
Shmuel: Only on his heart, not for other Jews (i.e. only a personal commitment, not a general law) #DafYomi 36a
7828 2018-02-20 04:34:41 Hold onto your wallet & purses I've a feeling that under this Corrupt government we have more misery to come, Trudeau's attempt to bankrupt this country, destroy all trade & with Whynne chase all investment & manufacturing away, end oil sands, were doomed to misery

7831 2018-02-20 04:34:24 I have a diesel oil heater at home, and it definitely never bullshitted about being ‘clean’, it said it would be efficient :)
7832 2018-02-20 04:34:05 why do some girls wear so much makeup that they end up looking like an oil painting
7833 2018-02-20 04:33:51 The dilemma of a Snake Oil salesman; your lies always return to haunt and bite you. 
7834 2018-02-20 04:33:45 You also have to walk to the volcano, even though you have mothereffing giant eagles at your disposal. Them’s the rules.
7835 2018-02-20 04:33:36 Back burning the midnight oil again after a nice refreshing stretch off. While it was refreshing, vacation time always goes way too fast...
7836 2018-02-20 04:33:36 Big oil has had to tip every energy official across the board. They will go broke trying to win this war. Oil innovation has been met by even greater renewable innovation. Oil has been living on credit cards. About the equivalent to second mortgage on the house to buy stock.
7837 2018-02-20 04:33:32 @seanmdav he should volunteer for  school security and stop being a tool for the media! Breaking his gun zero difference
7838 2018-02-20 04:33:21 There's no enough. 16% of oil in spills gets cleaned up. $1.5 billion is a drop in the bucket. There's no plan able to protect BC's coast from a catastrophic spill. There is no economic way to remove that carbon from the air, once it is there. Not a tradeoff I'm willing to make.
7839 2018-02-20 04:33:02 I love to fry them up in some avocado oil and eat them with some eggs & hot sauce or in a lettuce wrap with a little guacamole. Wife hates that I stink up the house though.  Can’t blame her the smell sticks around a bit. And I throw the can in the trash. But I love them.
7840 2018-02-20 04:32:58 Rav: If R. Yehuda HaNasi's court didn't expound the verse, will we not expound? In Dan 1:8, Daniel committed in his heart two types of drinking משתיו (written in the plural), meaning, wine and oil #DafYomi 36a
7841 2018-02-20 04:32:42 I was under the impression that all granola had nuts in it. I just read the ingredients in mine and it's just oats, sugar, oil, and honey mostly. Doesn't seem as wholesome when you put it that way.
7842 2018-02-20 04:32:34 You are a snake oil salesman
7843 2018-02-20 04:32:32 Ok so I got tea tree oil at ulta, you just dab it on your fingers and apply to the problem areas. Jojoba oil from amazonI’m sure you can get both from there. Start every 2-3 days then work your way to every other day. Rotating oils. You’ll see a difference! Younger healthy skin
7844 2018-02-20 04:32:20 Elon has been pouching his navy from the offshore oil industry that both the deep sea tugs and barges used by #SpaceX were originally made to support. Even the hydraulic turbines the drone ships use to hold position were designed for exploratory drilling rigs.

オリーブ油(extra virgin oilが良いでしょう)は、入れなくてもいいんですが、梅肉とはよく合います。それに、納豆は独特の匂いが有るので、オリーブ油は、上手く和らげてくれます。試してみて、好みに合えば

7872 2018-02-20 04:28:30 But by all means tell us The Faith of Donald Trump!! 

Let's cut to the chase:The real Faith of Donald Trump is that he believes with all his heart the rubes he cons will keep defending him, proclaiming him a man of integrity, when he's just selling them the snake oil. True faith

7880 2018-02-20 04:27:12 Shmuel to Rav: Acc to you who says Daniel decreed the prohibition against gentile oil, how could R. Yehuda HaNasi have permitted it?

7881 2018-02-20 04:27:08 A lil tip that I’ve recently started doing: use coconut oil to shave/as a moisturizer when you get out of the shower, it leaves your skin so soft & feeling amazing 
7882 2018-02-20 04:27:07 Unless they’re hiding hella oil money, it won’t bother 45 a bit. Poor kids are too young to know what makes the  go round and it ain’t demonstrations or die ins.

7891 2018-02-20 04:25:09 R. Simlai: R. Yehuda HaNasi's court were counted (voted) and permitted gentile oil

7925 2018-02-20 04:19:31 I too share the same opinion. Batteries will be scarcity like oil if no concrete steps are taken now

P.S. The unemployment numbers looked great before you got there, but those were fake. What changed in the calculation, you snake oil salesman?
7933 2018-02-20 04:18:33 @fayedsouza Few years ago a committee constituted by the government had reccomended that special norms should be adopted by all Oil Marketing Companies while posting officers/personnel at sensitive locations
7934 2018-02-20 04:17:59 What I find interesting is our government insists on taxing oil but does comparatively little to tax the actual polluters. We tax oil but don't tax car and aerospace manufacturers for producing carbon polluters.

7945 2018-02-20 04:16:47 Dammit I was hoping that with taking the CBD oil tonight + drinking more water I'd be able to sleep easier. I think I know the source of tonight's stress causing insomnia to take hold pretty strong tonight.... work related stress.

7962 2018-02-20 04:14:29 One can hope that this isn't the case. I would believe Iran couldn't afford a war with the conditions back home. Lebanon is no better off. Syria has to rebuild in the coming decades. Russia just wants to sell weapons and export oil.
7963 2018-02-20 04:14:23 What sort of money are the oil companies paying you anyway?
7964 2018-02-20 04:14:17 I am aware of that. As an American myself, I know that Americans commit these types of crimes too. I don't see that the fact that he's Mexican changes anything, since Americans do these horrible things too. We also bomb other countries to steal their oil.

8104 2018-02-20 03:56:25 America NEEDS TO run on renewable energy. Oil, gas and coal are dinosaurs. Invest in new, green energy sources or get out of the way while someone else does.
8105 2018-02-20 03:56:16 We’ll see how permanent these jobs or any will be as oil companies are reluctant to invest in Canada as the immigrants can’t even find jobs. Harper was Harper & we had a recession- all you in opposition is relate to 10yrs and no debt like in the last 2 which has no recovery date
8106 2018-02-20 03:56:11 A big shout out 2 all the ladies who wear their real hair. It seems so rare nowadays with weaves +  wigs running around that there are people who deep condition and put vitamin oil treatments in it. #relaxdontdoit #IAmNotARobot #realhair

8109 2018-02-20 03:55:43 Christians sell weapons to Muslims, steal oil from Muslims and bomb Muslims and then seem bemused by terrorist attacks.

The only problem being that most people who regard themselves as Christian are not at all and the same applies to Muslims who distort their faith to kill.
8110 2018-02-20 03:55:22 I don’t think that’s the question one should be asking at this point. Film v digital is analogous to oil v acrylic; you’re going to get a stellar image (if handled properly) with both but what you look for is an aesthetic quality that doesn’t factor in “emulation”.

8174 2018-02-20 03:46:11 Tucker, when you asked that clown Chris Hahn about going to war with China because they tried to influence our election and he said “no I just want sanctions” does he know how WW2 started with Japan?  Oil embargo - look it up.

8200 2018-02-20 03:43:50 US is obsessed in saturating global's oil market with its own oil production from fracking of shale that has caused acute environmental concern from methane released during the process.

8242 2018-02-20 03:36:39 i remember this couple i think, kidnapped an oil exec and put him in a coffin and then put him into a storage locker. he basically cooked to death from the heat.
8243 2018-02-20 03:36:30 How does it influence the oil price? Do You believe like tim rogers in a huge stock market crash in 2018-2019?
8244 2018-02-20 03:36:15 While selling out the US and its interests. If Ru/Iran/Syria/Quatar and China get their pipeline it screws Saudi Arabia and could result in the world not having to purchase oil in US dollar a.k.a. Petrodollar-that would make our sanctions worthless. It’s a theory—I’m not certain.

8246 2018-02-20 03:36:04 i would  have to see more evidence than your tweets. I live in ND where we just had an oil boom. 2% unemployment. Restaurants had a huge increase in customers but some  went out of business because they had to pay too much for wages. I didn't do their books just  saw the results
8247 2018-02-20 03:35:55 BIO OIL WILL SAVE YOUR FACE FROM ACNE SCARS
8248 2018-02-20 03:35:51 LOL.  You're joking right?!?!  Donald Trump and faith go together like oil and water.
8249 2018-02-20 03:35:46 Expensive but its pretty good for you. I dont eat healthy but ik chicken gets old. Only other option really is fish and salad. Olive oil garlic and lemon bro. So good for your body. Someone said cobb salad thats good too.
8250 2018-02-20 03:35:45 @davidhogg111 NRA cares about MONEY not children. Forever DEAD KIDS- they couldn’t care less. Big Oil feels the same
8251 2018-02-20 03:35:45 I’ve been putting coconut oil in Elijah’s bath water & his eczema has not come back 
8252 2018-02-20 03:35:10 Yess bc it claims that this bio treatment oil can improve the healing of scars and wounds. So kalau letak kat jerawat yg pedih or baru pecah tu bangun pagi esok dah kering dah

8262 2018-02-20 03:33:54 This is rather profound ignorance. Dr.Jill Stein is leader of the Green Party in the US. The policies of this party are entirely opposed to big oil, military expansion and Wall Street. A little reading might be useful.
8263 2018-02-20 03:33:42 Gotta pay my couch bill, get an oil change, and get new wipers

8267 2018-02-20 03:33:33 everybody knows that when DonaldTrump abolishes a crucial regulation, a true #Christian dies a slow emotional death
8268 2018-02-20 03:33:24 Peter Kelly prefers killing of foreign Gays.  Canada’s Gay friendly oil & gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil & gas from regimes that throw  off Buildings. Protesting pipelines = supporting #LGBTQ murder @vancouverpride @uvicpride Say hi to Gay hating Peter in Victoria
8269 2018-02-20 03:33:18 Yes. And to his other point, hopefully women will demand equal representation in dangerous jobs like mining, oil rigs, etc.
8270 2018-02-20 03:33:14 He blamed the Secret Service for the cancellation of White House tours.

Blamed Republicans for the BP oil spill.

Sebelius went under the bus for Obamacare.

Fox News was responsible for his many scandals.

Blamed Reagan for a distrust of government.
8271 2018-02-20 03:33:09 See Alaska before the Republicans sell off our pristine wilderness & oceans to the oil companies. The GOP already has made it legal to kill hibernating bears and shoot animals with high powered rifles from the air! The GOP kills anything for the right price

8274 2018-02-20 03:32:38 This is all Alberta’s fault. They don’t understand social licence and are not negotiating fairly. It’s really easy. Shut down all of the oil sands, fire everyone, declare bankruptcy, and basically just go die. Then you can have your pipeline. See, social licence is easy!!!
8275 2018-02-20 03:32:37 Freighters have caused a number of fuel oil spills around Vancouver, but they're not protesting to shut off their supply of iPhones.

8298 2018-02-20 03:29:23 Not necessarily.  She can lie & pout & go through a bottle of baby oil per nudie shoot. That doesn't make her qualified for Mensa. I don't see a problem with that comment.

8324 2018-02-20 03:25:08 Correct, @gop is not for the small business man. However, they have very much shown they are for big business...look at the tax bill, look at the roll backs on regulations. It is obvious. Particularly in the financial arena and oil/gas.
8325 2018-02-20 03:24:36 There is no greater con job than the one Trump pulled on evangelicals. His "spirituality" is whatever snake oil he has to sell to get votes.

8342 2018-02-20 03:22:21 America controlling oil has little value to us. The only thing we benefit from our partnership is your military. That’s sanctioned military not some yokel faction. Unfortunately in order to keep that partnership our troops have to die.
8343 2018-02-20 03:22:17 Your to not conform to the patterns of the world but revelations is a warning. Pay attention to the signs of time and what to look for and by God this is it. Draw from wells either oil or uranium and by fire in a diverse place and the anti Christ would come as a political figure.
8344 2018-02-20 03:22:15 I think you can shave some and add it to olive oil to flavor it too
8345 2018-02-20 03:22:02 Start working towards saving lives instead of defending a sociopath, parasite, illegitimate who stole the WH & is systematically destroying our government, our country -he sold us out to get his loans from Russia paid off - all for no sanctions so Putin can have the OIL! wakeup!

8348 2018-02-20 03:21:42 And that top Democrat is an oil executive. What a state.
8349 2018-02-20 03:21:38 Here for the world to see and enjoy:

1 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup almond butter
1/4 cup cacao powder
1 tbsp maple syrup (or honey or nothing, up to you)
1/4 tsp vanilla
Pinch of cinnamon

Whisk it all in a small saucepan to melt then pour in ice cube tray & freeze to set!


8350 2018-02-20 03:21:35 TIL that the French have major drone bases in West Africa that interestingly coincide geographically with uranium mines they're invested in. America put a drone base in Niger a year after major oil reserves went up for development. They're not even hiding it, let alone ending it.

8384 2018-02-20 03:15:32 Hey Bison, when you have no air to breath, no water to drink, no roads to drive, no air traffic control, when you pay the highest prices for internet in the world for the crappiest service, when you beaches are covered with oil, it will suck to be you.

- #MYR also benefited from encouraging oil prices & economic data.
- #GDP came in @ 5.9% 4Q17. 2018 may see some moderation, but #growth expectations still in 5% levels.

8395 2018-02-20 03:14:08 I was in bed for 4 hours and took some oil that makes me motivated and less moody in order to do it. I really shouldn’t have dairy so i’m not doing any favours for anybody here

8409 2018-02-20 03:12:32 No one could rationally support Trump, he's systematically done everything he can do to tear down our country - every environmental protection was sold to oil and mining, every human right was sold to the religious right wackos, he's even loosening gun laws - and TREASON!!

8412 2018-02-20 03:12:09 Well said. The thing that gets me really frustrated is when people are so used to calling high-level shots that they end up favoring the snake oil and can’t see real value when it appears. That gets real old real quick.

8433 2018-02-20 03:09:49 Another great thing is called thieves oil! I know it sucks so bad, hot showers made me feel better, you'll start feeling better in a couple of days. Smoothies are also good if you got the puking part of the cold.. Mine got so bad.

8448 2018-02-20 03:06:22 See? Look at you both. 

You're just screaming about socialism and not actually giving specifics. but if I point to state-owned businesses that work: literally most of the other oil, Europe's rail services, the NHS (even with Tory underfunding) - you have nothing to say.
8449 2018-02-20 03:06:19 Completely different concept.  Alaska’s citizens receive an oil royalty, which varies annually, depending on the state’s oil revenues.
8450 2018-02-20 03:06:08 Russia gets a significant portion of their GDP from oil and gas. Why would Putin want a POTUS that would expand US oil and gas production?
8451 2018-02-20 03:05:55 I've seen it happen over and over. In my own field (network IPS), the market isn't smart enough to distinguish snake oil from things that work, so it was full of snake oil. Sometimes the snake oil salesmen hired engineers that eventually got their product to work.
8452 2018-02-20 03:05:47 arab status quo have big ambition with oil field reservoir but without measured their power or economic is very low. Syrian Refugees exist in Turkey many years since the conflict started.

8569 2018-02-20 02:48:35 You need to get the rose moisturizer from Fresh. If you’re lacking oil check out the sugar body oil... also from fresh and put that on top of your moisturizer before bed twice a week. Also make sure you’re not using a stripping cleanser
8570 2018-02-20 02:48:29 Norway's sovereign wealth fund was built from oil proceeds when prices peaked. They fund is $1 trillion strong. Angola's only got to about $5bn. You need resource prices to go your way and unfortunately those days are gone. Sadly, it is unlikely to happen for us anytime soon.

Add 2 thinly sliced leeks (if no leeks, use white onion & a shallot if possible). Stir occasionally til translucent.
8588 2018-02-20 02:45:34 Half point because the fact they relied exclusively on oil is the major reason their economy collapsed after the price of oil crashed,

8676 2018-02-20 02:32:12 We could have had many refinery jobs and selling gasoline and diesel etc to the rest of the country at full price. Worth 5 times more than you will ever get for tar oil.

8682 2018-02-20 02:30:58 Very true. Indigenous call oil "The Black Death" for a reason! They are the true owners of this country, being slaughtered generation after generation, left to live in abhorrent conditions, where water is tainted and scarce. Sickening!

8692 2018-02-20 02:30:03 So Americans are doing it safely and expanding oil exports, so Canadian are not a smart, careful and capable as your southern neighbors? Methinks not. 

You're making the case that oil can/is being exported by bulk vessel responsibly and carefully to world markets. You stay poor

8717 2018-02-20 02:26:39 Stunning people dismiss notion of a tyrannical govt & the rights of an armed population. We've seen oil wealthy states of Iran & Venezuela shooting unarmed protestors who they oppress dead in streets. The Founders enshired that we could protect outselves and our families
8718 2018-02-20 02:26:35 You don't know what you're talking about. We can increase to 15 Million barrels per day and still be the last nation producing oil. If we are not shipping worldwide soon, we become a war prize of the superpowers in 10-15 years.
8719 2018-02-20 02:26:19 lol they had private  enterprise until the government took control of the oil sector, the only advantage they had, and ran it into the ground, stopping all the flow of money into the country and dragging the rest of the propped-up economy with it. In 2007 the government

8846 2018-02-20 02:04:40 It’s true everything can’t be cured. It’s true that some things are hard to diagnose. But it’s pretty unlikely that some snake oil salesman is gonna succeed where medical science can’t.  Get a second opinion. Read up in real medical literature.

8896 2018-02-20 01:58:14 Something with Shea butter and/or coconut oil is your best bet. Vaseline works, too. Idk if they have it in Canada, but Neosporin actually makes a lip balm. It comes in a little white tub.

8939 2018-02-20 01:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8940 2018-02-20 01:49:52 Do you use a leave in conditioner? That could help. Also a VERY VERY small amount of oil (like coconut oil) just on the ends could help. But if you straighten/use heat on your hair put the oil on after (if it’s an oil you can cook with) otherwise it could fry your hair.

8955 2018-02-20 01:47:08 Dont think anyone care,  which caused the collapse of the oil market.  We the people remember.  We  remember pleading dont make that deal but no one gave a fck.  And as quick as that deal was made it was forgotten.

8957 2018-02-20 01:46:46 Define “friendly”. No point for jt explo w/ tsayna as d era of oil is finished. The new milieu of LNG, fuel cells and battery is dawning.  Even tsayna has laid a policy banning vehicles running on oil by 2030. Hence, heavy capex on oil search is useless. There’s a 4GW battery now
8958 2018-02-20 01:46:42 Lavender bedroom spray or lavender burning oil helped me. Sprayed her sheets or burned the oil for about 20-30 minutes before putting her to bed. Home girl was OUTTA THERE

8962 2018-02-20 01:46:14 They all think there is a switch that when its flipped we are able to magically transform our society away from oil instantly. Nice to see you challenge them, no one is more guilty of this than E May.

8986 2018-02-20 01:42:08 Ok Bio Oil. You put it on your face over night. Works miracles. This is the stuff we ladies use on stretch marks after giving birth. I am certain nothing, absolutely NOTHING about your face exceeds that degree of difficulty.

9019 2018-02-20 01:38:21 Great idea Mike!.... It's time for Canada to ask our oil dependent environmentalists to pay more in taxes if leaving resources in the ground is their answer. Any volunteers...? #reasourcespayyourwelfare
9020 2018-02-20 01:38:18 Somehow in a 3-2 Blades OT win all 3 stars are Oil Kings. I get that it doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things but that is some rampant homerism right there.

9027 2018-02-20 01:36:36 We’re supposed to feel bad for these families, but not the families that work in the oil and gas sector who’s pipelines are being blocked, which has costed Canadians $177 billion over the past 7 years. Boo-hoo, BC.
9028 2018-02-20 01:36:22 I keep hearing "data is the new oil" all the time. I know it's true but let's come up with fresh slogans every so often please.
9029 2018-02-20 01:36:12 It appears that someone is upset that idiots are spending tons on Goop for high end snake oil and wants here piece of the pie.

9032 2018-02-20 01:35:53 This makes perfect sense when you realize that the US cares only about who controls Kirkuk oil. They need Iran/Russia for boots on the ground, but don't want them to get too powerful.
9033 2018-02-20 01:35:52 We are one great big Canadian family! Why don’t you invite Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to BC and sit down together an resolve this oil pipeline and wine dispute once and for all over formal discussions. Show some professionalism as Premier an help protect jobs in AB n BC.

9060 2018-02-20 01:33:00 You will "protect" our oceans and resources as vigilantly as you "protected" ANWR. Meaning you will tweet and give lip service and hold them as bargaining chips until you can sell the right to exploit them for profit to the highest bidder like big oil in exchange for a bribe.
9061 2018-02-20 01:33:00 How does Tia's hair never get greasy?? We have the same kind of hair and with the amount she touches it, mine would be soaaaaked in oil. #TheBachelor
9062 2018-02-20 01:32:40 If you’re really about “America First”, you would be behind efforts to use renewables and not be dependent on oil from the Middle East. You’d also be for not ruining America by burning fossil fuels or fracking. Just a thought.

9069 2018-02-20 01:31:49 Even though I don't care for him I disagree. He can better spend his money to help humanity than our federal government can and he knows it. That's why he probably has 5 tax attorneys on retainer to help him pay as little as possible in taxes.

9098 2018-02-20 01:28:04 is this a worldwide picture or Canada? also, I have not said stop all oil production, I just do not see the need to increase it when many places are turning to alternate sources of energy as we debate
9099 2018-02-20 01:28:03 I also tested fries for the first time. Sliced up some big ole' russets into long fried. Tossed in a big Ziplock with a drizzle of avocado oil and a little salt. Air fry for 15 minutes. yummy and much healthier.

9109 2018-02-20 01:25:36 The rose toner and rose oil at Trader Joe’s is delightful. I suggest you make the purchase. $10 for the pair. #whatadeal
9110 2018-02-20 01:25:33 Common sense  democrats is the same thing as oil n water they don’t mix or make sense because communist democRATS have no brains ! Thank God for our founding fathers who gave us the constitution because they loved this country ...
9111 2018-02-20 01:25:14 I had an oil spot on my back seat from carmex that fell out of a jacket pocket and melted.
9112 2018-02-20 01:25:00 It and it’s healing properties were mentioned in the Torah, Bible (Old Testament, book of Isiah, called Black cumin), and the Quran.  Muhammad said Black seed oil cured most ailments except death.
9113 2018-02-20 01:24:57 Delincuente por comprar gas oil en la frontera jaja escucha a este loco, te sientan en la guaranga a impuestos, y a la plata que te queda la tenes que gastarla en donde ellos quieren, después el sistema esclavista es otro...
9114 2018-02-20 01:24:44 Unprecedented for the last century, anyway. And Harding didn't have Harding-branded oil wells.
9115 2018-02-20 01:24:35 C'mon! Europe has had enough of 'anti-Russia' sanctions - which have hurt their farming and industrial exports and put energy supplies in jeopardy.
Russia has used it as a stimulus to local production, whilst US tries to force their oil/gas exports to replace Russian supplies.
9116 2018-02-20 01:24:23 And when they forced the Japanese to retaliate on Pearl Harbor by cutting off trade and oil to where they were one week before being depleted, just so they could have an excuse to drop that bomb. But that part never gets told. Why would Japan attack an enemy who is more armed.
9117 2018-02-20 01:24:21 Yes I do but they have dug holes so deep I'm hoping they hit oil! 
9118 2018-02-20 01:24:13 That’d be a terrible mix lmfao. Like oil and water
9119 2018-02-20 01:23:50 I’ve trusted his advice. I now own an oil company, and 21 Properties. I’m financially free, and I could retire today if I wanted to. I’ll make over $100K this year, mostly passive income from my Real Estate. I listen to him every week on the APP

9126 2018-02-20 01:22:51 Wow, time to change that oil Junior.
9127 2018-02-20 01:22:50 It can be reversed, it's not completely new. Harding sold the naval oil reserves to his oil industry friends.
9128 2018-02-20 01:22:46 Then you better get busy banning the 18,000 large ferry crossings that occur every year across the Salish Sea. Those ferries are powered by dirty bunker oil that according to you cannot be moved safely. Or are you merely an orca protector of convenience?

9136 2018-02-20 01:22:00 @Chris HAHN we don’t have Oil because Obama Stopped the Oil because of Solar, Green Energy, $800Billion Package The yr. he Got In.

9137 2018-02-20 01:21:59 Actually every weld is xrayed, every inch of coating inspected every inch of the whole pipeline smart pigged. Stop asking the questions over and over and answer one question: Canadian oil safely thru the established route of KM2 or blood oil by tanker? PICK ONE

9141 2018-02-20 01:21:11 If enough effort is put in, we can extract oil by squeezing sand. You may be able to drink water at a mirage. It is also possible to even spot a rabbit with horns while roaming around the world. However it is impossible to get a prejudiced fool to see logic.
9142 2018-02-20 01:20:56 It's the sanctions. The arctic oil deal. tRump is just in it for the big payday.
9143 2018-02-20 01:20:22 Skin looking edible af! Coconut oil be the plug for real. 
9144 2018-02-20 01:20:20 Always freeze the tahini until no chunks remain.  Make extra to freeze for later!  Remember to add olive oil to the ice.  Delicious!
9145 2018-02-20 01:20:18 - That 747-8F in the foreground was purchased brand new from Boeing for market rates.

- The fuel, oil, parts, deicing, catering, insurance, etc that keep it running are purchased at market rates.

- But the pilot’s that fly it across the globe are expected to work for 60% less?

9180 2018-02-20 01:14:32 Oil industry creates so much money they’ll never let us go to all electric or water powered cars. Vehicles in the 80’s could get 20-30 mpg and we still getting the same shit. You can’t tell me we couldn’t be driving 50-70mpg by now but that would cost them too much money.
9181 2018-02-20 01:14:23 Wrong, world consumption is increasing and they want  our oil. By delaying the pipeline you are only helping the USA and trump, they buy our oil at a discount and turn around and sell at market price.

9183 2018-02-20 01:13:30 Oil either comes by pipe or rail from Canada or the Us (with lower safety) or It comes from countries with poor human rights records and if they have a spill there is NOTHING canada can do about it. You don't want K2 or tankers then suggest a solution.
9184 2018-02-20 01:13:25 No, you provided oil shill talking points and ignored actual research. You think you've got all the answers....but stupid can't be fixed, I'm afraid, so I think we're done here.

9220 2018-02-20 01:09:41 10s of thousands work in the oil and gas industry in BC. Most of wich is in NEBC . The oil and gas industry also contributes heavily to infastructure on the lower mainland. The oil and gas industry has not once hurt our tourism industry either.

9239 2018-02-20 01:06:29 I don't understand, was Israel still occupying Syrian land and taking the oil? Were they in Syrian airspace and if so what were they doing there? Until these questions are answered you should refrain from any rash decisions.
9240 2018-02-20 01:06:12 it’s a bolder flavor than olive oil but i love it....get a small bottle and give it a try!

9250 2018-02-20 01:05:00 Except that it's increasingly important on the two markets Russia depends on: EU and China. Gas prices are generally oil indexed so it's not about disruption unless LNG competes on a market with pipelines. It does in many EU markets, which are integrating, and is key for China.
9251 2018-02-20 01:05:00 Jumping in here, but if I ever get that perfume made based on each song (each has a specific essential oil), I decided when the album came out that the perfume would be called "Unspoken Longings".

9254 2018-02-20 01:04:33 Then why can't you understand that this is the choice: A=KM2 brings oil to LML or B=foreign tankers do. There is no 3rd option. If you say no to KM2 then you are picking B. If you're actually against tankers you should be saying yes to KM2 so the LML fuel comes via pipe not ship.

9258 2018-02-20 01:04:19 The concept is simple. Run your dirty oil to a refinery that doesn't require it to be shipped over the ocean in an oil tanker or build your own refineries and do what you please with it. You won't get approval to ship more by sea from Vancouver.

9270 2018-02-20 01:02:24 So...LNG is right now only a fraction, and not (yet) enough to disrupt the system on the aggregate...it wouldn't be relevant competition compared to what a prolonged oil glut would do, IMO.

9272 2018-02-20 01:02:03 you may also have actual fears as you relayed a message to me to incite fear, that the port will blow up. I’m sure you educated yourself on those probabilities. I think everyone in the city that cares has concerns about things like LNG, oil refineries, chlorine etc
9273 2018-02-20 01:02:00 @Dennis_Kucinich simply stopping drilling does nothing but shift the problem elsewhere. That is NOT leadership.

9372 2018-02-20 00:46:59 I got this lil diffuser done dropped some peppermint oil in that joint.... #heaven
9373 2018-02-20 00:46:43 Because the Kurdish "spice must flow" (and not through Turkey)...  Through Iran->Pakistan pipeline.  Wonder why Saudis are training Pakistanis?  And if Israel is there, too, ready to ensure the deliveries of Kurdish oil (recently Exxon handed it off to Russia) on the OBOR?
9374 2018-02-20 00:46:43 Just slather lavender essential oil all over yourself and hope for the best 
9375 2018-02-20 00:46:40 If your gel flakes, mix it with an oil! 
9376 2018-02-20 00:46:38 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
9377 2018-02-20 00:46:29 They are kids who are being pulled from all sides. They are being exploited by the media and gun control activists. They are scared and confused. They need love. Tough love I'm sure, but still, a little understanding. I'd hate to be in their shoes.
9378 2018-02-20 00:46:25 I traveled to Newfoundland to consult with Premier about pensions 

The whole plane was loaded with workers returning from the oil patch 
Think I was only come from away on jet 

Regrettably province is insolvent today as never could get pension changes

9380 2018-02-20 00:46:11 Fair enough but off the top of my head can't think of another socialist country that doesn't have privatisation. It was the oil price manipulation that collapsed the economy but the socialist policies made the fall harder and left them in the current dystopian disaster
9381 2018-02-20 00:45:54 I just did the last oil change of my life!  Got my 2nd #Tesla about 2 weeks ago (#Model3 ), and did final service before selling my ICE car.
Thank you #ElonMusk !
9382 2018-02-20 00:45:47 You lost me when you delved into semantics. "Tar sands" is far more accurate than the PR-ed "oil sands," both of which terms are used ubiquitously.
9383 2018-02-20 00:45:37 I’m honestly surprised they couldn’t get Morrow Field House at SRU to hold the GC-George Junior and Oil City-Sharon game. Geographically it makes sense, but I guess not in the eyes of the District...
9384 2018-02-20 00:45:33 @ local barnard folks. does anyone have a mixing bowl, vegetable oil or an egg?? i really really need them lol
9385 2018-02-20 00:45:31 To be expected when someone like Hansen says development of AB oil sands means "game over for the climate" and they all lap it up.

9391 2018-02-20 00:44:31 Watching jacques pepin spill truffle oil all over his dish. Same.
9392 2018-02-20 00:44:30 0/10 recommend putting tea tree oil in your bath. My skin fucking burns.

9394 2018-02-20 00:43:47 I love how Argan oil smells
9395 2018-02-20 00:43:12 You know what, it's kinda tasty lol. Like for real. I think it's because of the corn but I added some olive oil to it too. Might try avocado oil next time.

9399 2018-02-20 00:42:55 Do you know that spills as small as 0.5L have to be reported and cleaned up? That every time there is a land based spill that every gram of soil for double the distance of the spill is vacuumed up and remediated? How would you plan to pick oil from an incoming tanker?
9400 2018-02-20 00:42:41 For your face - ROSEHIP OIL. It has changed my life
9401 2018-02-20 00:42:31 @cnnbrk Trump is arming Ukraine. , putting missile defense in eastearn Europe, killing Russians in Syria. Beefing up us oil/ gas to Europe. Thing the pussycat BO would not do.
9402 2018-02-20 00:42:25 Bitch you and I been tired and did better than that oil
9403 2018-02-20 00:42:25 I feel like the coconut oil eco styler doesn’t have a strong hold as the one I normally use
9404 2018-02-20 00:42:04 Well he didn't keep his promise that when he became President he would show us his taxes-come on-we know what a liar he is-and tell him thanks for all the deregs-Making it easier for the mentally ill to get guns, we don't really mind dirty air water unsafe oil rigs elder abuse

9407 2018-02-20 00:41:52 In North Korea, citizens still aren’t able to get clean drinking water in some cities. There are regularly massacres in churches and schools across the country. Their government is being dismantled by a group of corrupt billionaires and oil companies.

Never mind, that’s America.
9408 2018-02-20 00:41:20 I'm guessing Oil City is the victim of having to play in a doubleheader. With most of the teams playing that night in the Sharon area.

9411 2018-02-20 00:40:37 Jamaican castor oil has saved my life
9412 2018-02-20 00:40:32 I don't think you get it. I don't suffer fools gladly. I find people's unwillingness to be logical in the face of cold hard facts to be irresponsible and tragic. I have no respect for Trump because I know him from his days in NY and NJ, long before MAGA fans bought his snake oil.
9413 2018-02-20 00:40:26 I would encourage the editor to make their own! Once you make it and realize it’s just yolks, oil, Dijon, and lemon, you understand it better. Plus it tastes 10x better than the processed junk on the shelves!

9424 2018-02-20 00:39:20 Mizon snail recovery gel changed my life moisturizer-wise but like Erica said an oil cleanser (naive or inisfree, which takes off makeup!! Even waterproof eyeliner!) and then a foam cleanser (aveeno rn)

9426 2018-02-20 00:38:40 No pain meds? I wouldn’t recommend alcohol. I’d go for CBD oil over that. Alcohol gets dangerous....once used it as a sleep aid.
9427 2018-02-20 00:38:28 Him instead of edmonton. Every single one of those teams is run better than the jokers that control the oil. Mcdavid probably would have a cup by now.

9435 2018-02-20 00:37:04 @T18_p

9436 2018-02-20 00:37:02 life is hard right now and my furnace ran out of oil last night and it’s supposed to snow again this week. i’m very cold and it’s making coping with my chronic illness a lot harder
9437 2018-02-20 00:37:02 Lucy was sooper gentle w/ snax but inhaled mommas fingers when she gave those! Do you think it’s better than other kinds of fish oil?
9438 2018-02-20 00:36:45 Y "la autoridad" si le puede faltar el respeto al ciudadano? Porque el Sr Presidente los acusó de contrabandistas de gas oil.
9439 2018-02-20 00:36:45 So Oil Kings have 9 shots on goal through 2 periods....and two of those shots were a bit dubious.
9440 2018-02-20 00:36:25 My dad had Shingles down his throat, eating or swallowing was almost impossible. And my wife had it, she applied the correct essential oil and quickly recovered.
9441 2018-02-20 00:36:17 The dreaded carb flu. Hang in there. It's worth it!! Add extra fat - Olive or coconut oil.

9449 2018-02-20 00:34:45 @RaysBaseball I know this might be a silly question. But my prized Rays Jersey has had some type of oil poured on it. I found it after it has soaked in. I have soaked and treated with oxyclean and washed several times. No luck. Any recommendations to save my jersey?

9473 2018-02-20 00:31:43 Wow you are really hung up on LA in 92. You cannot assume outcomes with weapons would have been different in those other situations. Are you a fortune teller or a snake oil salesman?
9474 2018-02-20 00:31:22 Too much oil too! A common problem! Sure, cook the bacon and a little sausage to add to the shrimp, but DAMN--drain it first, please!!

9493 2018-02-20 00:29:12 Arguing that building pipelines to carry bitumen to tidewater for export will reduce oil imports to eastern Canada is also disingenuous.

Cheap, free , renewable energy have less profits for them.  Real news.  People choke because the elite prefers it .
9513 2018-02-20 00:26:39 You are grasping at straws and repeating the same baseless arguments ad nauseum even after I've presented facts over and over. You actually want more risk claiming it's less risk. Itss really simple: Safe oil through KM or high risk oil from countries with no human rights.

9516 2018-02-20 00:26:34 The left want to give them a national platform and claim they're immune from criticism. Well, if they're gonna use them to sell falsehoods they have to be corrected. It's wrong to put them in this debate because of this but they don't care.
9517 2018-02-20 00:26:32 Yes, we do use sesame oil in some of our entrees.

9526 2018-02-20 00:25:24 Three options, IMO:
1. Exploit as many chasms in the intl system to sow larger disintegration.
2. Reverse course and seek European integration.
3. Sink the oil/gas tentacle into Europe, which has nearly no resources.

US can sanctions only when Russia exits Crimea, no exceptions.
9527 2018-02-20 00:25:24 Sure you must know the market will be flooded with snake oil salesmen. Look at the state of the internet today. Preying on the desperation of families is not the way to go here.

9533 2018-02-20 00:24:46 If we don't produce oil, usa will. There's no ifs ands or buts about it. Why cant we produce natural resources and transition to renewables at the same time. Your smoking analogy isn't quite the same.

9543 2018-02-20 00:23:46 Another of many things that Russia does to affect oil markets.  Fortunately, capitalist ideals run strong in the oil fields of the USA.  IF money is to be made, it will be made.  @EnergyPhilFlynn does Russia trade in US dollars or another currency?

9548 2018-02-20 00:22:50 Pretty logical.
9549 2018-02-20 00:22:42 Once “Build 3x” is in full swing, we can expect inflation to remain high. When the economy is booming, unemployment is low in the short run but inflation tends to be high. 

Coupled with a weaker peso and higher world oil prices, inflation will likely not drop any time soon.
9550 2018-02-20 00:22:32 I just watched this documentary though on Netflix with Leonardo Decaprio and they said that just changing your diet, eliminating palm oil and beef, is good enough.
9551 2018-02-20 00:22:23 “Russian Bots” is just what he calls his hands.
9552 2018-02-20 00:22:14 Yes I am. I lived in Delta for many years. Yes it's my coast too. But I work in the industry (I used to hydrovac expose pipeline for inspection) so I know what I am talking about. If you choose against KM your choosing blood oil brought by high risk tankers from countries like SA
9553 2018-02-20 00:22:12 I see the sheikhs are furiously pumping more oil tonight to grease the palms of the #FA #Aguero# WiganvManCity

9555 2018-02-20 00:21:16 Sending you a hug. 
9556 2018-02-20 00:20:41 In any case, since vast majority of oil spills on our coast are from fuel barges, I suggest they walk the talk and shut down all oil, gasolene, jet fuel and diesel going to the island.

9559 2018-02-20 00:20:24 No no that’s not what I mean, that shit is good but I cook it then empty the water then eat that shit it’s actually good af with some olive oil and the spice 
9560 2018-02-20 00:20:05 So question is.  Why is Saudi the centre point for Western Governments.  This goes beyond oil. You say Zionists control the world.  What about the Saudi influence?
9561 2018-02-20 00:19:59 @searscares I scheduled a synthetic oil change online for $51.99. #labor not included!# #hidden service fees!Went up to $88.00 out the door! #Beware of Sears coupons!!!!
9562 2018-02-20 00:19:52 The same companies which disclose under the authority of the Texas railroad commission for oil and gas well head production don’t make the same data available to the Queensland government. #OOTT #qldpol #auspol
9563 2018-02-20 00:19:49 @ETNreisenweber Any reason why Sharon gets to play Oil City in their backyard on Thursday?
9564 2018-02-20 00:19:37 Where, then, did you get the notion that climate change is fake? The only people I’ve seen disagree with that are politicians, the people that follow them, and the big oil/gas companies that pay them to say that.

9572 2018-02-20 00:18:34 I have baby oil too which helps but like that's so much work
9573 2018-02-20 00:18:33 Is there a basic, running website where we can find out the biggest drops of cash(public) to our lawmakers? NRA,  big pharma, companies that bid for state/federal projects,  oil companies,  etc? For lack of a better term,  a shaming list?
9574 2018-02-20 00:18:25 Are they another USA funded anti cdn job/resource industry/anti oil group?
9575 2018-02-20 00:18:22 You want lowl costs & increased safety; but you don't want a pipeline that you don't even know the route for. You want your cake and to eat it too. That pipeline is 4.6 x safer than rail. That is fact & means no foreign tankers bringing oil for $4/L from places that stone women.
9576 2018-02-20 00:18:15 Up and down till summer. Then inflation down. Watch crude oil. Up now, going down, goes up again in May till June 30, then down, down, down. Where she stops nobody knows.

9604 2018-02-20 00:14:34 I meant Cathedral also an attractor of sort, the point society will converge to. As I see, human societies left alone (no wars) are converging to something similar.

9616 2018-02-20 00:13:18 I always tell my clients rinsing your conditioner out with warm water is like rinsing  a greasy Pan. If you want to get the oil off it’s great. But, with conditioner you want to get your moneys worth and allow it to work. I promise the difference will be instant.
9617 2018-02-20 00:13:08 My suggestion is an oil free spray! I use LimeLight by Alcone’s first base primer spray. I know Too Faced has the hangover primer spray and smashbox has a primer water as well!!

9653 2018-02-20 00:08:06 In Social Media the “squeaky wheel” gets the oil. You have to put yourself out there... - Jessica Northey #Quote
9654 2018-02-20 00:08:01 Does she think that putting oil in it was a good idea
9655 2018-02-20 00:07:47 Essential Oil Tip : Palmarosa grass produces an oil with an aroma that can be stimulating & soothing when diffused. #essentialoils
9656 2018-02-20 00:07:44 I really do not like labels.  I have found in my long life they’re rarely true and serve no purpose but to divide.  I remember a “United we stand” America.  We do not have to agree but we still love each other. If we who know God chose not to show love than who will? 
9657 2018-02-20 00:07:28 Someone tell Bill he can write any amount check to the IRS and they'll cash it.

9659 2018-02-20 00:07:12 #Crude #Oil NEW HOD!!! $CL_F @ 62.59 +1.04 +1.69%...
9660 2018-02-20 00:06:59 Oil change 
9661 2018-02-20 00:06:53 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9662 2018-02-20 00:06:47 Good point! Lots of olive oil fraud out there.
9663 2018-02-20 00:06:46 ALSO! If you ever get a breakout, TEA TREE OIL!!! Pop some on before you go to bed and you’ll be looking like a new man in the morning
9664 2018-02-20 00:06:33 Love is when your SO gets up early to change the oil in your car before you go to work. #KindnessMatters #Love
9665 2018-02-20 00:06:23 Aloe vera & coconut oil to shave  My skin so soft man
9666 2018-02-20 00:06:05 Needs some castor & jojoba oil
9667 2018-02-20 00:06:04 They were. It's a pretty simple recipe if you want to make it yourself. It's just potatoes, salt and oil. Cut the potatoes into pieces and fry them in a pan or a deep fryer with some oil and then salt them.

9670 2018-02-20 00:05:32 Use beard oil and shampoo.. smooth untadi
9671 2018-02-20 00:05:25 Oh no! I had it. It was BAD!!!! Stay away from sugar! Drink lots of warm liquids (no comments from you!) and get some oil of oregano. Monitor your temperature.
9672 2018-02-20 00:05:23 Not a fan of deforestation either. Nice strawman. The pace of unchecked oil sands development in Alberta (subsidized by royalties paid by AB to the companies who are realizing all the profits) has already far exceeded ability to reclaim.
9673 2018-02-20 00:05:06 Vitamin C oil  trust
9674 2018-02-20 00:05:04 Dow masih di 25.219. S&P500 masih di 2.732. Oil di 61,32 dan Emas di 1346
9675 2018-02-20 00:05:03 Dont worry about free markets & rising oil prices. Ana’s centrally planned economic model (alla Soviet Union) will ensure free energy 4 all
9676 2018-02-20 00:05:02 You’ll have books for those too. But not the oil. The Americans won’t let us have any oil. 
9677 2018-02-20 00:04:59 Lies .. oil related
9678 2018-02-20 00:04:51 Proving that you can't buy class, even with oil money.
9679 2018-02-20 00:04:44 Eggs, Asparagus, with a little bit of mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and some sea salt.

I still hate the taste of asparagus but it was good for me and I got some delicious eggs around it :)
9680 2018-02-20 00:04:31 At dealership for an oil change & working on a screenplay about young love & street racing in 1973 post-Vietnam oil & financial crisis & Watergate & a lady customer just complained that the coffee machine has been out of hot chocolate for at least a year
9681 2018-02-20 00:04:07 Dudes who have a preference of bitters in their bar-ordered Old Fashions absolutely go home and jerk off with organic hemp oil while listening to Hemingway on vinyl
9682 2018-02-20 00:04:03 That’s why I don’t eat cake. Never seen a cake recipe that asks for garlic or olive oil.
9683 2018-02-20 00:03:44 I wish Venezuela the best of luck with this interesting idea, but I think they need to get rid of the current govt if their situation is to improve.
In theory, the petro should shadow the price of oil, much like Tether/USD, depending on investors' faith in the Venezuelan govt...
9684 2018-02-20 00:03:36 Norway puts a lot of its oil and gas revenues into “quality of life” related spending... Their #xcski team has a waxing budget bigger than our team’s budget. Most our population lives in the green south and now don’t even like #winter
9685 2018-02-20 00:03:26 Totally gratuitous. He worried he may go off someday?
9686 2018-02-20 00:03:21 And if you read the article "the science" is such horseshit.  Liberal illogic at its best.
Evidence = some Marine life leaves area when seismic is being shot.  
Conclusion =  marine life being driven extinct by seismic activity.
Solution = stop all oil and gas exploration
9687 2018-02-20 00:03:02 The squeaky wheel usually needs the oil
9688 2018-02-20 00:03:00 My mom tried to steal my coconut oil from me and I broke out in rage. #imahippyomg
9689 2018-02-20 00:02:56 Do you cleanse before moisturizing both times? Or just cleanse once a day but moisturize twice. Also the moisturizer I use is 100% unrefined jojoba oil
9690 2018-02-20 00:02:43 Baby oil show on mfc tonight!!  10pm to 2am! Show starts as soon as I get naked!! @MyFreeCams @MFCShare @MFCLoungePromo @MFCpromotion @babyoil
9691 2018-02-20 00:02:28 Anybody can suggest any website that i can browse to get better understanding oil & gas process and activities? Both upstream and downstream. Bonus kalau ada equipment and materials used for the activities. I need to accelerate my learning for products/services knowledge.
9692 2018-02-20 00:02:28 Should be relying on less oil all together by putting solar on every home possible, using electric & fusion type cars Saving oil for the longer haul trucks & for manufacturing needs
 But of course we should work on using our own oil resources
9693 2018-02-20 00:02:25 Solution: an oil pipeline going west and a wine pipeline going east. #bcpoli #abpoli @RachelNotley @jjhorgan
9694 2018-02-20 00:02:17 Without oil ownership you would be nothing but our irritating little brother. Just like Liverpool to Everton.

9697 2018-02-20 00:02:08 To be or not to be. Sharp $DXY move up to make a short squeeze with another wave of a "crash" lowering bond yields, oil and gold prices, or $DXY break down below 87 and inflationary spike which will lead to a final crash. Left or right. No middle choice...
9698 2018-02-20 00:02:07 Washington's goal for Syria involves partition and regime change, as well as a permanent entrenchment of the US military, the expulsion of Russia and Iran and the securing of all oil fields and pipeline routes.
9699 2018-02-20 00:01:50 Tip of the night: Wash your hair with warm/hot water to get into the follicles & clean them out. When you condition, rinse your hair in cool to cold water to close the foillicles and allow the conditioner to do its job. Conditioner is like oil on a pan but in a good way. 
9700 2018-02-20 00:01:43 Exactly!! @repgregwalden needs to read this and consider their votes to ravage our contry for the benefit of oil, conagra, and.monsanto. #outside #wilderness #freshair
9701 2018-02-20 00:01:41 Add Russia Today, Luke Oil, and Ural Motorcycles to the list of Russian crap to keep out of The United States! If Russia wants to sell anything to the US then get rid of your asshole leader Putin. Until Putin is removed ban Russia’s entering the US. We need a Russian Travel Ban!!
9702 2018-02-20 00:01:23 You are a black goddess. So stunning. Have my babies and wash their future curly hair with coconut oil plz.
9703 2018-02-20 00:01:22 They also threw coins at the police .... that oil money doesn't half get around!
9704 2018-02-20 00:01:11 Try castor oil, hair oil, and the number of Border Patrol Stations.
9705 2018-02-20 00:01:02 Hemp oil readily available in the UK 
9706 2018-02-20 00:00:41 OIL DIFF: 3.17 -> 3.21
9707 2018-02-20 00:00:40 i have sensitive skin & moisturizing twice a day really helps! you just have to be mindful of the ingredients/chemicals in each one though!! Vitamin E oil/lotions are god sent!!! Also, if your skin is typically more dry then use a hydrating face mask after the charcoal one! Xoxo
9708 2018-02-20 00:00:20 Only charletans would sign up to peddle Trump's snake oil science policy.
9709 2018-02-20 00:00:10 You really don't understand us. "If BC had oil sands" well the fact is we don't, Our employment comes from the health of the environment, in many and varoius ways, you think it is acceptable to demand we put everthing we have at risk - we have a problem with that.
