72 2018-09-18 23:16:50 Funny I looked at the 10yr chart today and wow it doesn’t look bearish to me but I expected rates to rise into this resistance. I’m less about predicting and more about adapting so if rates want to bust through 3.1 I’ll add more sectors and stocks that do well as rates rise

    China responded on Tuesday by unveiling 10 percent tariffs on about $60 billion of U.S. goods effective Sept. 24.
Initially they were talking about tariffs in the 20 to 25 percent range, and that's actually been lowered to 10 percent.

132 2018-09-18 22:38:45 Here’s some advice on $TLRY or any other stock up 800%. Just remember that all stocks that go to the MOON end up in someone’s URANUS.
133 2018-09-18 22:35:41 This is the issue you have to deal with trading a stock with pending issues.  Everyone know SEC is investigating them.  You don’t have this if you trade FANG stocks
134 2018-09-18 22:35:32 yes, it's what I plan on trading.. the watchlist are the main 4-5 stocks I am watching.. I have charts up of the same 6 stocks every day on a different screen..
135 2018-09-18 22:35:30 These are the 6 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$BX, $ROL, $PGR, $ICE, $AON, $AJG
136 2018-09-18 22:34:31 $FNGD is right at it's 4 month high and trending higher.   It is short 10 of the #FANG like stocks.  They are all going down, just not at the same time.  Being short has better risk reward right now.. $TSLA $FB could be down 40% in the next year.
137 2018-09-18 22:34:12 I'll buy and actual piece of shit if i know it will make me a profit..  I use stocks/crypto/s and options as a vehicle to buy and sell for a profit... No emotion.. Turd or OCN.. Lets make money !

155 2018-09-18 22:22:56 Loving the #potstocks right now. I think this is the start of more monster runs like back in early 2014 and 2016. $ACBFF $TGODF $MMNFF #cannabis #marijuana #stocks
156 2018-09-18 22:22:55 I mean it did crash and it likely will never make that run again, like pot stocks and other offbeat moves before...but it still being up 100% tells you this market protects even its worst sectors
157 2018-09-18 22:22:12 los estados financieramente se componen de flujos,no de stock,los unicos stocks que recibis son negativos,deuda,contratos y obligaciones,y en ese contexto ,el macrismo recibio uno de los ratios de deuda mas bajos del mundo ,por eso le prestaron las cifras que le prestaron
158 2018-09-18 22:21:17 I find that people don't WANT 2 believe this. They want 2 believe that there's some objective merit metric that can determine max profit...kinda like how hedge funds think they can pick stocks better than index funds. When people want to believe something, they will.

172 2018-09-18 22:11:07 You missed my analogy,lol. Some eat up MSM as their source. Would you trade stocks based on Crammer or do you do your own digging.
173 2018-09-18 22:10:59 $SPY Stop looking at the stocks you wish you were in and start thinking about how you can be in those stocks, before the run higher. $STUDY

197 2018-09-18 21:56:49 @globeandmail so you guys spread FUD about marijuana stocks and now you’re selling a newsletter for $999 a year? Who wants to pay $999 to read biased news all the time. You’re obviously biased against marijuana legalization. Best of luck with your very over priced subscription
198 2018-09-18 21:56:30 If you read the paper, you might agree with what it proposes, but I digress. (1) Bump stocks should be treated as NFA items again, but are irrelevant to 99.99% of gun deaths. (2) No, and they already can't.

Again, if you had ever heard what these kids are asking for, you might agree with them. 
Do you believe there should be stricter penalties for selling/owning bump stocks? Do you think the mentally ill should purchase firearms? #CommonSense
205 2018-09-18 21:51:05 where did BNN get the information on the deal?
206 2018-09-18 21:49:50 I hear you just curious if a Nasdaq stock can go under a penny. . I took my loss too around a nickel or so
207 2018-09-18 21:49:07 Fun fact I didn’t know until I purchased some: When you purchase stock options, the premium you paid, fluctuates like the stock market. You spend $100, it could stay at $100 value or go up or down. I had no idea. You can also sell the options like you can stocks.
208 2018-09-18 21:48:46 Nearly a billion can definitely move even large cap/liquid stocks around.

210 2018-09-18 21:48:41 @jimcramer  if they need to raise more stocks, why wouldn't $TLRY consider a 5 for 1 split to get more shares instead of doing a secondary offering and tick off it's shareholders
211 2018-09-18 21:48:31 1st off, a claim is not evidence. None of these people came forward for decades until his name was suggested as speaker. 2nd, tax breaks are beneficial for millions that don't own stocks.

213 2018-09-18 21:46:42 I'm a little wary of Pot stocks right now.  I wanted CGC, been trading it over several weeks.  TLRY - Kicking myself as I new it would go back in the 30's.  I want5ed a pullback.... no such thing.   LOL
214 2018-09-18 21:44:00 My rule of thumb is that I do not hold onto overvalued stocks. This would be a nice day trade though, but I had my eyes on another stock today that did even better
215 2018-09-18 21:43:40 1/3 of $TLRY stocks are being shorted. Does that mean 2/3 of investors are that clueless? #cannabis #PotStocks
216 2018-09-18 21:43:20 $TLRY So Cramer just said the pot stocks are going to come down hard....when?
217 2018-09-18 21:42:33 I bot one 8.1450. CARGILL marketing programs, representing millions of bushels CZ18, SX18, have to be fully hedged soon. They waited, but it never turned. Play was stocks use ratio. Pops tonite?

219 2018-09-18 21:41:45 How weird is it @jimcramer to mention marijuana stocks on the air?!  @tilray 
220 2018-09-18 21:41:41 So Cramer saying they have to raise money Cramer is also saying these stocks going to crash after October 17th you idiots are still buying $TLRY
221 2018-09-18 21:40:47 I'll be the first to admit Idk shit about stocks, but Netlist has done good by me today.
222 2018-09-18 21:40:32 $TLRY will be the same as Bitcoin stocks.

233 2018-09-18 21:34:26 London Stocks - a lovely brick, with a lovely colour to them. No wonder they were so popular... 
234 2018-09-18 21:34:20 Yep. No "getting out" in aggregate. Someone has to hold every share until it's retired. Meanwhile, buybacks plow cash and debt proceeds into stocks at extreme valuations (as 2000, 2007). Less a "return of capital" to all shareholders than a bailout of future losses for a few.

Do you support common sense gun laws?

274 2018-09-18 21:18:37 This abuser of people and power has gotten on my last nerve yet again. There is no depth to which this poor excuse for a human being will not stoop. When he's done abusing us, let's bring back stocks and pillory in the public square.

279 2018-09-18 21:18:06 well done Patrick! I hit a new portfolio low for the year today, down 60% now I think it is. CANN dropping 13% after someone sold 800k in the last 2 mins sealed my day's underperformance. Its a cruel market when you aren't in the few stocks that are performing well
280 2018-09-18 21:17:10 @RepSwalwell Apparently, Rep, you don't understand the part where the president has the final authority on declassifying information. You should just sit down and go back to watching cartoons.

296 2018-09-18 21:10:52 Maybe this makes me in a crash caller, but when UST10Y gets close to 3.5, US bonds should come to eat US stocks' lunch. It may not mean a stock dump but at least a range bound market for months.

343 2018-09-18 20:50:32 Cannabis stocks feel a lot like the .com bubble. I make no predictions about the when... but eventually, all about two or three are going to crash hard. Maybe all of them and still only a couple survive.
344 2018-09-18 20:50:28 XRP seems to be the real deal and being in the center of a concrete usage of cryptocurrencies. XRP solves a problem. Most, if not all of the other cryptocurrencies have no purpose whatsoever. This could mean buying XRP today could be like buying Amazon stocks in the 90’s.

352 2018-09-18 20:47:10 Sorry Rebecca, we don't have the heads up on this. It's for a limited time only, while stocks last. Give us a shout if we can help with anything else.
353 2018-09-18 20:47:07 May even be lower since similar stocks have essentially been flat since Elliott initially filed.
354 2018-09-18 20:46:37 Exactly. How well stocks are doing only measures how artificially rich people who can afford to buy stocks are getting. What would happen to a stock price if a company announced large pay increases to its lowest earners instead of dividends? “Pro-business” = pro rich people.

361 2018-09-18 20:43:19 Agreed and add brand awareness. Those aspects is where Canopy outshines.

373 2018-09-18 20:38:12 Tyranny always comes in the form of "protection."

Probably 90% of the people who are able to trade Cryptos wouldn't be allowed to trade stocks because of the "consumer protections" in place.

407 2018-09-18 20:21:30 I think that the stocks will grow but will cap off quick once everyone starts to go public. That's why investing in nutrients as well as marijuana will be more lucrative

409 2018-09-18 20:21:14 You have no clue how stocks work. News today doesn’t effect stock prices. Quarterly reports and sales affect the stock. Number of shares sold/bought move the needle not news. Stick to sports because you are clueless about stocks and the markets

413 2018-09-18 20:17:58 Investors are now flocking to cannabis stocks.  Their hope is to buy shares low . . . and then sell them high.  Really, really high.

415 2018-09-18 20:17:13 No. Prove those BS numbers. Not one new good job has been created since 2008, including under Obama. The tax cuts went to the wealthy to buy back stocks. Wall Street is destroying the middle class, not poor immigrants. Americans are not being victimzed by other victims. Get real.
416 2018-09-18 20:16:57 I know its bad for farmers globally, but we we could a few more years like 2018 to deplete global stocks somewhat then the people will maybe sit up and take just how important farmers are to society when you can't get what you want from elsewhere in the world.

465 2018-09-18 19:51:11 Stocks take longer than people "want" to move the way they want, in order to frustrate the hands that always need stocks to move daily. Longer, tighter and quieter the base, nicer the breakout since people without patience will be squeezed out due to their own weakness.

510 2018-09-18 19:29:39 A 12.5-percent reduction is not a "big cut". In fact, for what it is intended—to conserve perilously low #chinook stocks, the only food of some #orca populations that straddle the Canada-US border—it is pathetically LOW.
A 50-percent cut s/b the minimum, a 5-year moratorium best.

519 2018-09-18 19:26:05 True. But that was a mid-cycle adjustment in rates, one that came only a few years into an economic expansion. Now we're 9+ years into one, an expansion that has been accompanied by the longest bull market in stocks ever. Not sure the situation is very analogous, you know?

527 2018-09-18 19:21:44 Also for those of us keeping track, watch for HUUUUGE buying opportunities next week with $BILI lockup on Monday, and $IQ lockup on Tuesday. Those stocks are up big since IPO, and there'll probably be some pretty wicked selling.

554 2018-09-18 19:04:56 In reading about $tsla, I constantly hear how it is 'one of the most heavily-shorted stocks in the market'.  Disingenuous.  40% of the short position is due to the prime broker hedging Musk's 13.6 mm pledged shares. Then there are the converts.  So the majority is self-inflected.

656 2018-09-18 18:15:19 I'd be interest in learning whether Prof. Ford received any unusual amount of money in her account, her relatives accounts, or property, or stocks, etc. from BEFORE, DURING or AFTER making these accusations about Judge Kavanaugh.
And any FUTURE financial questionable gains...

660 2018-09-18 18:13:31 He clearly maniputed the market. He's not a successful entrepreneur for no reason. Elon knows how to make money. He might need the stock price cheaper for a big fish to load the trialer on Tesla stocks.

681 2018-09-18 18:07:02 One of those stocks is up about 25% today. Over the past month a buyer could have easily taken profits on half their position recovering the initial investment plus a nice return-holding the rest for pure speculation. The risk is to those who are late to the trade.

The last time the yield spread was this generous in favor of bonds was in December 2007, which as some traders still around today may recall, is when the recession officially started.

689 2018-09-18 18:03:20 And the BOJ is also purchasing different asset classes, stocks (ETFs) and even indirectly real estate (REITs) whereas the Fed didn’t do anything like that, also because of legal restrictions, I guess.

Do we just trust they do the right thing? 

I don't see why it does not work, just replace stocks with tokens, security or utility, its all semantics bro. I mean I don't see ICX doing a scam on the whole world.
717 2018-09-18 17:52:26 Hmm ya, I didn't invest in pot stocks either. Maybe I'm a bit chicken. I like to buy and hold for awhile, and I wonder if there won't be quite a few of the companies going bankrupt. It's like a gold rush right now, but in the end there are only a few big gold companies, right?

733 2018-09-18 17:48:11 Honestly fab was being funny with that guns and butter song but if you actually listen he’s giving real life facts. You have your guns ; Cars, clothes shit that depreciates with value. Then you have stocks and bonds. THATS THE BUTTER. Guns and butter baby
734 2018-09-18 17:48:10 Can’t believe there aren’t more etfs dedicated to cannabis-related equities - as you write, there were hundreds of tobacco companies before the giants consolidated. Holding a pool of cannabis growth stocks seems like a logical way to gain exposure to the cannabis industry
735 2018-09-18 17:47:55 I’m a newbie. Just started following the market and researching companies. Some of these stocks are trading higher than companies who have been around for years and worth more. It’s so confusing
736 2018-09-18 17:47:35 A temporary setback & you know it! Just like with Nike. Maybe stocks are up because this all fell during a school year & retailers are dropping the price to get rid of them but in a few months Nike will feel the burn!
737 2018-09-18 17:47:34 I thought tokens in this space = investing in stocks, if you invest in stocks, you are essentially buying a piece of a company, correct?

I thought the same was true with tokens.

741 2018-09-18 17:46:06 Absolute insanity. There is an etf trading under MJ that is tempting, but in my opinion holds too many tobacco stocks with no cannabis exposure
742 2018-09-18 17:45:59 I think the point here is to disprove people’s immediate and un-educated opinions that Nike is done and their stocks will nose-dive.  He shouldn’t get credit for the brief drop and current rise.
743 2018-09-18 17:45:38 If your invested with daily returns in mind, you can reach your goal.
If you trade for pennies each day,  make a dollar  invested right you’ll reach your goal.

756 2018-09-18 17:42:00 there is one really reliable way to spot tops:  it's when guys like you start getting loud about how the good times last forever, the bubble baby stocks are LT investments, and the shills that push them are new paradigm prophets.

787 2018-09-18 17:27:36 EXO literally brings in the most money for SM. So duh, they’re obviously going to invest more in groups that bring in more. Just look at how their stocks increased when they announced an EXO comeback and then decreased when our comeback was pushed back further.

810 2018-09-18 17:14:12 Stocks go up, stocks go down.  It will take 6-12 months to see if their decision will affect stock prices.  My guess is that the decision will have little to no effect on stock prices.

That said, people burning their Nike apparel are idiots.

841 2018-09-18 16:59:45 Well, being “correct” trumps everything.  But to your point, we disagree, I guess. Sometimes momentum endures and trends continue and sometimes they don’t. Stocks being non-serially auto-correlated is a statistical fact impossible to buck.

845 2018-09-18 16:58:34 GCL and YCA are your lot on the UK markets. YCA hold physical U, GCL is a bag of U stocks. There's BKY but they have political/environmental problems.
846 2018-09-18 16:57:53 Agree it’s the right thing to do LT, but stocks are just reacting to excess liquidity in the short term in my view. A very light QT month before the Fed and ECB start more aggressively draining. Ultimately it will reduce discretionary income and be very hard to walk back.
847 2018-09-18 16:57:10 Stocks adding to gains, hit session highs. MBS getting weaker - be on guard.
848 2018-09-18 16:57:09 People are also forgetting that there is a segment of the market that puts pressure on stocks based on what public reaction might be. Stocks don’t move in perfect correlation with news or earnings or actual value. Shorting a stock can often be an art

903 2018-09-18 16:37:35 RSP is lagging the SPY today, but broke an all-time high while the SPY has not. I'm still of the belief that many of the overweighted tech stocks with excessive valuations are giving traders the willies. We'll see if volatility rises again when QQQ and SPY reach new highs.
904 2018-09-18 16:37:33 During a recession stocks take a huge hit because they're correlated with how the economy functions. I see smart money putting money into an uncorrelated asset like btc during a market crash to hedge against an economic downturn.

996 2018-09-18 16:00:28 From a backward-looking perspective it has never made sense to own "emerging markets".

That includes owning American stocks in 1900.

An investment in emerging markets is a bet is on the expanding prosperity and innovation of our species, and cannot be modelled in retrospect.

1030 2018-09-18 15:48:52 I agree on interest costs and think more people should be paying attention (we have both written abou it) - its gonna bite hard - but nobody cares right now and thus the short term keeps the current narrative alive - higher dollar/rates/stocks
1031 2018-09-18 15:48:47 I feel like we trade same stocks lol although I think I was just to patient on this one. Each time I put orders out stock got there but pulled quick so no fills.

1046 2018-09-18 15:43:46 Okay market is telling me something different from my own trading.  Have been playing short the indicies for the past few days, and now stopped out.  Guess Trade war is great for Stocks.  Who'd have thunked!

1048 2018-09-18 15:43:35 No matter what, markets keep going up anyway, this is insane. The risk is reaching insanity levels if this bubble pops. I wonder what would be the financial situation of all those companies that has been buying their own stocks once everything comes down...

1177 2018-09-18 15:03:03 I should spend more time thinking about how delta hedging can exacerbate the move in certain SMID cap stocks , both higher and lower.  Looking at you $SGMS.  The  open interest in the calls suggests this is a coiled spring on any move higher
1178 2018-09-18 15:02:52 What the mother fuck am I supposed to do between now and whenever the fuck that shade comes out and the launch and the limited stocks they'll only provide and so on.
1179 2018-09-18 15:02:29 I think everyone stocks up on Americano. It's is the best after all.
1180 2018-09-18 15:02:23 The weight of the evidence on an absolute & relative basis continues to be bearish for bonds & bullish for equities. We are getting very close to bond bulls throwing in the towel. If the consolidation in stocks resolves to the upside we are going much higher.
1181 2018-09-18 15:02:21 Lot of watch lost stocks moving well today.
1182 2018-09-18 15:02:12 I reckon their stocks will go up, like Nike.  Only in this case it will be for the sheer mockery value.
1183 2018-09-18 15:02:00 Opinion : Hottest #stocks have been pot stocks . Time to be careful after the fantastic run.  AMD is showing clear signs of a $3.00 trading range until new guidence. 31-33 /  MU has plenty of room to run !!  #TradingStrategy #investing

1187 2018-09-18 14:59:40 The marriage of big corporations with the emerging Cannabis market is going to happen...there is no stopping it. Its a great product that sells! Bigley!

1203 2018-09-18 14:53:39 I think the downtrend is more on large shareholders selling off if anything. But yeah, fundamentals are solid since they are still positive with income, which is rare with growth stocks.

1224 2018-09-18 14:47:58 Canadian pot stocks make me laugh!

The absurdity, other than valuation, is that they grow it indoors.  The future world cannabis market will be dominated by outdoor growers, located in the proper climate, as their costs will be pennies.

1251 2018-09-18 14:38:51 BTW, this works with non-currency instruments, as well.  The bid-ask spread for stocks like GM, XOM, MSFT, AAPL, etc. are very small. You can infer that they're very liquid.  The bid-ask for microcap stocks (less than $20 million mkt cap.) are much wider and less liquid.

1265 2018-09-18 14:33:38 Stocks represent a share of a company, something concrete that creates value for an economy. Currency is a medium of exchange which is very different. The crypto boom was pure speculation and in those instances somebody’s win is somebody else’s loss.
1266 2018-09-18 14:33:31 A steady stream of robust earnings and economic data has virtually zapped volatility from U.S. stocks, but a coming freeze on share buybacks could challenge the market.

1305 2018-09-18 14:19:25 I find stocks by reading @AjAwesomecalls 8:30am morning tweet, reading @psk2329 moring tweets, and a basic gap scanner. I prefer stocks gapping more than $2 and priced over $20.
1306 2018-09-18 14:19:07 Someone should investigate all congress in terms of insider trading they have engaged in accepting tips on stocks and later supporting bills that would increase their own investments, this would surely scatter the cockroaches.
1307 2018-09-18 14:19:07 Having a good government that plans for the benefit of everyone instead of narrow self interest is what makes Germany the economic powerhouse in Europe. The UK economy is bases on trading stocks, shares and laundering stolen money via the City.

1309 2018-09-18 14:19:04 What are you smoking now? when did tether stopped working? 
I still do not understand why people still talking about tether. I know for sure 2.8B tether is backed with USD, but it is possible that some tether printed prior wiring USD last year. Similar to leverage in stocks.

1314 2018-09-18 14:14:31 Is it possible some people actively hunt for opportunities like this? Getting in while everyone's running away and buying stocks on the cheap then getting out when the hedge funds come back in. 

Basically B.R.I.C and Next Eleven countries. High stakes speculation for high profit

Just trying a new strategy. Ppl post evidence of how scummy this Company is and stocks goes higher. Maybe if short sellers start praising this company ... stock will go down!

1336 2018-09-18 14:06:25 And Mr. Trump raving the economy is going so great. If you're in the 1% it IS going great. If you're a corporation using your "tax break" to buy back your stocks and lift the stock markets to new heights, it's going great. If you're a middle-class or poor family, there's nothing!

1349 2018-09-18 14:01:29 Agreed that swapping one 0-interest rate bearing asset for another does little. They bought stocks and REITs too. Hard to imagine that there is no wealth effect boosting C, and no effect on investment from doing this. I think they did affect real variables, but hard to prove

1438 2018-09-18 13:29:25 Orrin morals Hatch that co led the tax bill. Largest tax cuts for big business in the history of our country. 

What did big businesses do with the tax cut? Hire employees? Pay raises? Technology investments?

NOPE! CEOs bought back their own stocks giving themselves a raise lol
1439 2018-09-18 13:29:12 I heard the Crypto Cowboy dips into Chinese stocks 
1440 2018-09-18 13:28:50 Looks like its gonna be quiet day w penny stocks. Watching for now only @NBEV. Possible play. Still... 
1441 2018-09-18 13:28:34 There is no sign of shelving off stocks at Mussa. Also that the majority shop at Mussa is biased as well, yes it's big but cannot translate to your statement.

1448 2018-09-18 13:27:29 I have the feeling a lot of people who wanted to make fast money in cryptocurrency are about to start buying weed stocks. It’s ok to ride the rollercoaster up  But don’t get greedy. Remember it can come down just as fast 
1449 2018-09-18 13:27:20 Yea true. That was my rationale that it could potentially make more in stocks than a savings account

1451 2018-09-18 13:25:48 Dont you think it should be the other way round. One should invest more money in the times of uncertainty. Because only in the times of uncertainty, stocks would be available at bargain prices.
1452 2018-09-18 13:25:46 Hopefully the damn corretion comes within days and not months... Last night's Vshape recovery was a total joke... I dont follow japanese individual stocks but Nikkei breaking out of the multi week consolidation heading to Jan highs was totally unexpected IMO

1458 2018-09-18 13:23:28 First time since 2014, Goldman Sachs has downgraded Indian Equities from BUY to HOLD. Reasons are Expensive Valuation and Upcoming Election.
Goldman has been bullish on Indian stocks since March 2014 because of expected 'pro-growth government policies and structural reforms'.
1459 2018-09-18 13:22:23 Agreed. Even when China first announced the retaliation an hour or so ago stocks fell (as expected) but aud/yen and CNH rallied ....
1460 2018-09-18 13:22:10 Hot take:

Yoshi has top tier frame data and attributes, but bad hitboxes, no jank, and can't create opportunities on his own to deal damage or take stocks.  He can only win based on an opponent's mistakes.

1464 2018-09-18 13:20:44 Give me one good reason why I should feign interest when LPs boast about:

- being publicly traded (not everyone is involved with stocks)
- new grow rooms (when the current ones are not producing quality as is)
- their profitability as a company (this helps patients how?)

1480 2018-09-18 13:14:24 We don't buy pub stocks in the mkt so we have no stake in whoever they partner with.  Even though up from its 2018 lows, $ACB is still far below its highs-this might change that but the boat seems hard to miss if one wanted to buy it.

$BIDU
1492 2018-09-18 13:10:20 #Weed stocks continue to climb with jumps so significant that some are calling it the new #Crypto. The only problem with that is I see #Weed stocks being much more sustainable.
1493 2018-09-18 13:09:47 Domestic stock markets ended lower today, amid increased trade tensions between the US and China. Declines in metal, auto, banking and energy stocks also dragged the indices lower. Sensex and Nifty ended 0.78% and 0.87% lower respectively.
1494 2018-09-18 13:09:33 Look for the markets to bounce back today and specifically look for the #HurricaneFlorence related stocks to surge. After modest gains yesterday, $GNRC is due for a more significant value increase. Similarly, $HD will see steady gains.
1495 2018-09-18 13:08:16 ok, devils advocate here....  29 & 87 were both stock market tops, we're currently at an ath in stocks, so why would this theory apply solely to $BTC?   I completely agree, the stock market looks ready to tank, that's why I buy Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin...
1496 2018-09-18 13:08:15 I’m loving the updated Apple Stocks App. The new UX/UI is intuitive and easy to follow.
1497 2018-09-18 13:08:09 Are we ready for upcoming financial crisis? Do we save enough money now? We were lucky to survive in 2008. Can we make it for next one? Is it coming? If we have enough to buy cheapest stocks, how do we help others through adversity? What a great worrier. ╮(╯_╰)╭

1511 2018-09-18 12:55:58 Tech stocks always seem 2 B on a collision course w/ the reality that the general American public can never catch up 2 the newest "best" #SOTA thing 4 their daily use. I've seen this "trend" since the 90's & the explosion of the Internet, when I was an IBM PCB Test Engineer.
1512 2018-09-18 12:55:15 Deutsche Bank upgrades #Italy stocks to neutral from underweight following 13% underperformance since May peak. Sees 10% upside in 6 months. But FPR believes the crisis is just starting in Europe. It won’t be pretty.

Base metals valuations becoming more attractive: After the correction over the past few weeks stocks are now trading at a 13.2% discount to NAV at the forward curve. Historically, a discount of around 20% has been a good entry point.
1524 2018-09-18 12:46:07 The market surging for reasons that don’t help the middle and lower classes is bad for wealth equality. How many people have stocks? How many in the lower brackets.

1542 2018-09-18 12:37:26 @Tony_BATtista The Talmud instructed ancient Jews to keep one third of their assets in land.

1575 2018-09-18 12:17:13 China peaked in 2014-15 and this market correction is long overdue. Every major market outside the US is down this year and the Dow is down since January. 
If you think this is because of “trade wars” I have some weed stocks to sell you.

1577 2018-09-18 12:16:57 If JPM thinks Micron ( MU ) is a double then it would be wise to look at LRCX who sells the equipement for DRAM & NAND. Bad news was priced in & it appears that the news may be overstated & #stocks from the semiconductor & equipement for that sector may be way oversold. AMAT etc.

1591 2018-09-18 12:11:29 On Bitmex, when bitcoin is raging higher, longs usually pay shorts to incentivize them to short.

Trading under portfolio asset value atm, and one of their holdings, @MediPharmLabs, is listing this month (hopefully) and I expect it will do very well.

2072 2018-09-18 05:48:53 so that now you had twice as many stocks as you did before with no reduction in anything else, that might make you go buy a few TVs!

Is this making sense?
2073 2018-09-18 05:48:15 Like, if your financial planner called up and said that she shifted all your assets from stocks to bonds, that probably wouldn't make you go buy anything. On the other hand, if she called up and said you won some sort of competition and your portfolio had just doubled in size,

2103 2018-09-18 05:20:45 Can your scans locate any other stocks that have the same chart formation as $WHD ? That long asymentrical triangle with a flat top. I've been long some months and waiting for a breakout to add. The movement seems independant of other other oil services stocks.
2104 2018-09-18 05:20:00 On top of the base wage, we get biannual raises the first 2 years.  Monthly bonuses, full benefits package, PTO and UPT hours, Co stocks, lots of ways to promote or further your education.  It's up to me to increase my earnings from there.

2130 2018-09-18 04:56:53 Observation: These days you don't need to look at Nifty to do short-term trading .When Nifty broke out 11200 towards 11800 only key index stocks moved while small/mid caps dashed. Now Nifty comes down, select large caps are coming off while small/mid cap are having own trends.
2131 2018-09-18 04:56:03 Very true. Fund managers churn stocks like any other trader /investor. Not much difference really in the buying and selling.

2256 2018-09-18 03:11:52 Sure... real estate is local, stocks are national and global. Stable and moderate house price inflation is generally good. Regional house price deflation is an indication of bad economic conditions in that region. Stay away, get out, unless/until potential for recovery.

2260 2018-09-18 03:09:29 Instead of buying back their own stocks to inflate share prices, perhaps invest some of that windfall into their companies, build more factories, create good jobs, etc. You know, things that actually benefit most folks rather than only making the rich richer.

2304 2018-09-18 02:36:24 I like this Cos. Technology-ACB has invested in them.Only problem is,they seem richly valued .Sort of reminds me of  at Sector stocks in January.But what do I know?
2305 2018-09-18 02:35:37 Share market ല്‌ പണം ഉണ്ടാകണമെങ്കിൽ never invest in individual stocks. You will never be able to follow each one. Leave it to the experts who manage mutual funds. അവർ ഒരു വർഷം 1.5% എടുകുമായിരിക്കും , but only after giving you better than market returns.
2306 2018-09-18 02:35:29 it’s nothing strange with stray cats coming to our house and staying tbh it’s happened quite a lot of times before so we have stocks of cat’s food.
2307 2018-09-18 02:35:14 This is just awesome Mr @Stock_Hunter89 , i feel this would be a great move for me, due to my hectic work schedule i feel trading options is better than stocks. I can let them sit longer and merinate. @AjAwesomecalls will there by any chance be an annual sign up for this soon?
2308 2018-09-18 02:34:28 It’s not about the numbers

Stocks are priced at impossibly cheap levels vs core fundamentals

The more exposure to China the harder they’ve been hit

Trump’s tariffs gimmick based on a fundamental lack of how global economics work are. It’s no wonder Kudlow had a heart attack.

2316 2018-09-18 02:31:12 Other countries fiat is nose diving. Gold and silver will be citizens saving grace. Stocks and bonds are just paper when the bubble pop's. Central banking fault, not Trump.
2317 2018-09-18 02:30:14 U.S. Market Check
U.S.  stocks tumbled the most in a month as investors grappled with the  latest American threats to expand tariffs on Chinese goods.The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell one basis point to 2.98 percent.
2318 2018-09-18 02:30:02 Asian stocks had a mixed open even as U.S. stock futures declined  after the Trump administration’s latest barrage of tariffs against China.

Equity benchmarks in Japan were flat-to-higher, while stocks in Australia and South Korea edged lower.

2323 2018-09-18 02:28:10 LIAR!!!!  First, define "a lot" and "very good profit"
"there" stocks are doing very well?  Define "there" and "doing very well"
Define what you mean by "big raises" and " good things"   Again trump.  you are being vague and dishonest.  Name ten businesses with record profits?
2324 2018-09-18 02:28:05 There stocks?
No. "Their stocks" is correct. It is a possessive, not a location.
2325 2018-09-18 02:27:54 Please let that be the case as they couldn't be in better hands if he does have them. Better buy those popcorn stocks now, I have a feeling they're going to skyrocket to a new high in the very near future. That's one thing Trump will be able to legitimately take credit for
2326 2018-09-18 02:27:02 Stocks decline as market capitalisation sheds N46bn
2327 2018-09-18 02:26:51 How does investing in multiple mutual funds fare with respect to this statement?
I mean, even if you have 6 mutual fund investments with atleast 15 different stocks each, you have 80 stocks each at 1-5% capital! Surely a motherson sumi gets trapped?
2328 2018-09-18 02:26:29 Omg. People,

The stocks. And the stock market is different from the economy.
2329 2018-09-18 02:26:01 We shall see.....hopefully sooner that’s later....
2330 2018-09-18 02:25:58 V few names are building bases. Speculators should play it cozy in here w/ respect to fresh money buys, especially since the liquid glamours are no longer being accumulated, in itself a tell. $Naz is just above prior swing low, the break of which turns the trend to down. #stocks
2331 2018-09-18 02:25:19 Stocks down overall won't go down forever. Expect a small bounce at least from people seeing them as a discount.
2332 2018-09-18 02:24:34 When dogs overeat, their valuations start to feel like a bloated stomach and they puke  up the exciting profits. Today is a great reminder that the bloated tech growth stocks are going to be corrected and the value players are going to win the next season.
2333 2018-09-18 02:23:33 Also maybe get X number of stocks back after each map (maybe doesn't have to all go to one player) to keep it from becoming last stock v last stock after each person

2347 2018-09-18 02:10:29 Just watched he @smbcapital web seminar. Pretty excited as the two trades they showed are almost identical to the two I’ve been figuring out since starting last week. My main problems: 
- I can’t trade these stocks I find
- I can’t trade pre-market

Solution = find a new broker.
2348 2018-09-18 02:09:44 U.S. stock futures and Asian shares fell on Tuesday after Trump said he will impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

2381 2018-09-18 01:44:19 It is not big UNTIL you sell. Because stocks can go down 80% in less than a day.

2414 2018-09-18 01:25:13 The TSX has so many stocks in it that the dogs most likely are about to get de listed so most likely won’t work. The dogs of the Dow, however, are still one of the 30 largest companies listed on NYSE. This prescreen increases the chance of success of the Dow strategy.
2415 2018-09-18 01:23:49 Come on Daniel.... I’ve owned FFMGF and GLDLF for a few years because these were the gold stocks that were going to go vertical and fund my retirement...you are losing credibility by the day... getting 3 websites to hump same stock only works for so long
2416 2018-09-18 01:23:33 No, it’s dispersion model. It essentially buys beaten down quality stocks, hedging against SPY. It makes money as past performance quantiles reconverge, and loses money as they diverge. Normally makes decent money but loss periods are quite auto correlated...
2417 2018-09-18 01:23:15 Question when playing large cap stocks what time frame chart do you use 5min or larger thanks
2418 2018-09-18 01:22:44 Putting a good amount of my money into stocks 
2419 2018-09-18 01:22:33 buying stocks on the way up is safer than on the way down.  Xene has a strong chart, pump & dump would have been over long time ago. Calling something overvalued because they’ve gone up so much is also not a valid argument. $14 raise sends a strong message, there is still demand.
2420 2018-09-18 01:22:25 Of the deep state
2421 2018-09-18 01:22:01 Wow, what an issue.  Bart, and all of us, know that many of these stocks are going up 5x to 10x but can only buy if they double or triple.  So, those that bought up some stock inventory from URA probably had that issue too that made it more difficult for URA to unload some.

2424 2018-09-18 01:19:19 I would agree, it must be perfect conditions. The bed was full of tiny delicate Gray mushrooms in the early morning, the "melted" as the day went by.  You can see their withered stocks in the mulch around the slime. I will check tomorrow morning to see if there's more. Fun!

2427 2018-09-18 01:16:40 @Nike As a young up-and-coming investor, I strongly believe in Nike's message. Can't wait to buy some stocks next week. #Newinvestor #Nike #stockmarket
2428 2018-09-18 01:15:33 Tesla stock falling means the sky is falling and the end is near. Sure there are other stocks but $TSLA is the one almighty stock that rules over them all. TSLA is the savior of mankind. Thou shalt not short.

2436 2018-09-18 01:11:28 If Kendricks is in my face like he was Robinson. I'd be like, "Dawg you're going to jail in a few weeks, check the stocks"
2437 2018-09-18 01:11:00 im moving up in the world, imma be all like mhmm and not really say anything while some guy on the phone talks for three hours about stocks
2438 2018-09-18 01:09:52 ok well it's a Mag or Magazine there smart guy..Being "around" guns doesn't make you smart on the subject apparently..And bump stocks actually diminish accuracy so they dont necessarily "kill more".. Please educate yourself..
2439 2018-09-18 01:09:31 Yo, Canadian stocks listed on the TSX that announce a listing in the US are not "uplisting". It's a dual listing. The TSX is not a junior market to the US.
2440 2018-09-18 01:09:10 Combined with insider trading by SOROS CHERTOFF MURREN ADELSON etcetc..Remember these scumbags gambled MILLIONS that MANDALAY BAY/MGM stocks would plummet by purchasing PUT options..They made BILLIONS..WHERES THE OUTRAGE..xcop.
2441 2018-09-18 01:07:43 Time to take the heat off oil tankers and salmon farms. Sewage cannot be doing wild salmon stocks and orcas any good.
2442 2018-09-18 01:07:37 Stewie, do you find these types of stocks don't care about the overall market conditions? Are they still tradable in choppy periods?
2443 2018-09-18 01:07:34 Absolutely have the right to voice your opinion but you clearly have a gripe. It listed at 20c, delisting at 1:25 or so. I need more stocks you are sceptical about
2444 2018-09-18 01:05:48 It can be hard to convince millennials to enter the stock market. He has a 403b with a target date fund and a pension and a lot of cash which is in short-term CDs. It took me a couple of years to get him to open a brokerage account and just to even consider stocks. 10 years down
2445 2018-09-18 01:03:36 The border has no information on your personal investment....this is bullshit propaganda to scare people...and it worked. The stocks dropped bad for 1 day

2448 2018-09-18 01:00:55 All 3 big cap loser Pharma co’s w zero innovation and no growth. I rather buy anything else 
2449 2018-09-18 01:00:21 Yikes. Ugly index action. 5th distribution day. Leading stocks were down, but orderly. No reason to sell strong positions. Or not try new breakouts. Not feeling a bear market, just a pullback/correction that needs more time. That's what the market is telling me! $SPY $QQQ
2450 2018-09-18 01:00:12 The legal standard doesn’t include “whiffs” or allegations when determining guilt. He hasn’t even been charged with anything. Innocent until proven guilty.

Also, there’s nothing nefarious about paying off large debts all at once. You sell a block of stocks or withdraw 401K $.
2451 2018-09-18 00:57:28 I didnt allege that but actually my facts PERFECTLY fit that narrative. Wow. Packers fans are dense. Explains why people purchase meaningless stocks.
2452 2018-09-18 00:56:48 Also...Environmental stewards don’t buy pipelines that are guaranteed going to cause the extinction of a invaluable pod of #SouthernResidentOrcas, break our commitment to the #ParisAgreement and further jeopardize our endangered #WildSalmon stocks. #ClimateAction #Reconciliation
2453 2018-09-18 00:56:44 I mostly buy ETFs, which are doing very well, but I started buying individual stocks this year, not so lucky 
2454 2018-09-18 00:56:12 AWC, JAKS and MMSV should be on the watchlist for swing traders. However, latent trend are not strong enough if we look at the last week volumes for the respective stocks. #klse ##bursamalaysia

2456 2018-09-18 00:53:25 Stocks go up and down all the time. But America ALWAYS ends up on top. A drop in the American stock market is ALWAYS temporary. You leave that money in for 20 years. You BUY when stocks are low. Otherwise, you leave your money in a savings account. Leave it in a bank. @GOP @DNC
2457 2018-09-18 00:52:03 You buy individual stocks? I’m a boring index fund guy... tech stocks down today, not sure why. See what rest of market does tomorrow after new tariffs...
2458 2018-09-18 00:50:51 I mean, we all knew it was a sham. Companies used those tax cuts to buy back their stocks, and hoard the wealth. Meanwhile wages are stagnant during a freaking labor shortage.
2459 2018-09-18 00:50:50 The stocks are the highest ever because of him
2460 2018-09-18 00:50:39 Fuck. This means that Skip Bayless was right about something. Time to go cash in all my stocks and just vacation in the Bahamas until the apocalypse.

2465 2018-09-18 00:47:44 I've been learning about stocks, and cryptos lately. It still amazes me how much I dont retain information. Con's  of dyslexia.  I feel for everyone that knows this feeling. Such a frustrating  but beautiful thing..
2466 2018-09-18 00:47:27 Someone saw me wearing my Birkenstocks with socks today and went “stocks ‘n’ socks” and I can’t stop thinking about it.
2467 2018-09-18 00:46:03 One suspects that playing off China in stocks is the wrong game entirely. That trade is so crowded.
2468 2018-09-18 00:45:29 Be put in the stocks on public display!
2469 2018-09-18 00:45:13 The stocks are completely in the trash right now. What a better time to buy..
2470 2018-09-18 00:43:26 Same here. All cash plus some puts on china stocks
2471 2018-09-18 00:43:18 European stocks fell on Monday as trade tensions surged again amid reports that the White House was about to announce additional tariffs on Chinese goods.
2472 2018-09-18 00:43:12 Sounds like ur an emotional wreck over all this good economy, employment and soaring stocks. Geeze, what u do while Obama wa pres?
2473 2018-09-18 00:42:12 The FANG stocks are down an average of 15% from their 52-week highs.
2474 2018-09-18 00:42:06 Lol IT crazy market where pot stocks offer safe haven
2475 2018-09-18 00:42:00 investing in cryptocurrencies and stocks is where it’s at. 
2476 2018-09-18 00:41:29 US stocks fell on Monday as president Donald Trump prepared to announce tariffs on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese goods and China indicated it would retaliate in kind.
2477 2018-09-18 00:41:12 As I wrote in the blog this weekend. Pot stocks will be in play for a while. Some nice trading today with $cgc and $tlry. Follow the price.
2478 2018-09-18 00:40:18 I was wondering how high stocks would have to go before he reared his head again.
2479 2018-09-18 00:39:01 Well I can already say after seeing what was happening after hours, I will not be checking up on my stocks tomorrow...  #yikes

2481 2018-09-18 00:36:05 @natspooner5 what curve do you use? Saw some pro stocks that I think are yours, looks like Bauer PM9 or similar.
2482 2018-09-18 00:35:35 I know right 
2483 2018-09-18 00:35:26 Or just before lunch, as it turns out....
2484 2018-09-18 00:35:21 Stocks climb a wall of worry.
2485 2018-09-18 00:35:20 *their*stocks. Bow tie is too tight.
2486 2018-09-18 00:35:06 I think you meant to say that you have no time to be accountable for false information you put out.  Just because you can spell IT doesn’t mean you should report on it....I hear marijuana stocks are a hot topic
2487 2018-09-18 00:34:27 Take a look our our media news. How often do they dwell on stocks? Roughly 2-3mins. Politics, lunching, workshops has taken over the news.
2488 2018-09-18 00:32:44 avg down all #chinese stocks r down on tariff s
2489 2018-09-18 00:32:35 One for the business and one for my stocks 
2490 2018-09-18 00:32:31 Gold & Silver - massive value proposition at current levels - Gold stocks such as Gold Corp, Harmony, Silverlake Res, Perseus and many others appear extreme opportune at current price levels - I’m in it and add to holdings.
2491 2018-09-18 00:32:26 What I want to know is when can we start using the pillory, village stocks, and flogging as punishment again?
2492 2018-09-18 00:31:24 So definitely in it to make money...which at this point might mean save some of my money from evaporating. Dunno, no one does, but I would feel foolish being heavy duty long stocks in this environment...even though that’s where I really always want to be.
2493 2018-09-18 00:29:33 Yaaa i mean melnyk stocks and trading karlsson was crazy stupid and heart breaking buttt people are acting like its the end of the world
2494 2018-09-18 00:29:23 Thank you John, I do pay attn to stocks because I learned how at Wharton every other Sat for 5 yrs. Sessions begin again this month. It matters and knowing how to watch w/understanding is great.
2495 2018-09-18 00:28:38 New research from Citibank says Amazon should split into two companies in order to avoid regulation. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, Dion Rabouin, Andy Serwer and Benchmark CEO, Kevin Kelly discuss.

They heard Dr_Stocks
2496 2018-09-18 00:28:26 Haha.  Yeah when you engage in quantitative easing and print money out of thin air faster than any other President in history the stocks better go up.  Stocks are measured in dollars so the faster the dollar is devalued the faster the stocks go up.
2497 2018-09-18 00:25:15 Obama told people that stocks were super cheap in 2010 and would be a great time to invest, maybe you should have listened to him then instead of Zero Hedge

I’m clearly nuts.  My risk meter is broken.  I’m investing in penny stocks without great knowledge of the topic .
2501 2018-09-18 00:21:36 I'd be satisfied if we just brought back the stocks.
2502 2018-09-18 00:21:22 A lot of Dow stocks started high today and then the announcement was made...
2503 2018-09-18 00:20:44 LOL How many automatic weapons have you fired? Auto is spray and pray. thats the reason the military went from full auto to burst fire in the M-16's. Bump stocks are a novelty in most cases, used once in a mass shooting and he could have killed more without them
2504 2018-09-18 00:20:31 Yeah, I mean stocks only go up, so let's not panic.
2505 2018-09-18 00:20:09 There’s a 24 hour Budgens not a mile and a half away which stocks said item. Not to mention a great number of raidable, neighbourly window sills. Who is this fellow?
2506 2018-09-18 00:20:06 Not if all us investors dump China stocks
2507 2018-09-18 00:19:17 Congrats to you $14D folks. Well played 
Silenced the twitter trolling. Never understand why people feel need to rubbish stocks they don't hold. And are often wrong about anyway.
2508 2018-09-18 00:19:03 Don't trade S&P but had a strange dream the other night about watching stocks plummeting, a big crash, I recall amazon and facebook getting hit hard, but it was whole market thing.

I would however add that u were *prepared* in *receiving* it because u had a great education and/or long work experience *that* landed u at an amazing company. JHuang is brilliant
2517 2018-09-18 00:14:31 Baby! With a big new mortgage.

I think I'm shifting to long-term assets like bonds and treasuries within the next few months. I've already liquidated all of my actual stocks and have retreated to mutuals and index funds. It's just a matter of time before I head for safer assets.
2518 2018-09-18 00:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2519 2018-09-18 00:14:08 I’ve been shopping/cooking for a family since 1970 and I remember vividly the limited stocks and food/drink varieties in our pre EEC supermarkets, with only Liebfraumilch to accompany! Corned beef and tinned fruit was the staple British diet back then!
2520 2018-09-18 00:13:42 apple stocks rise by 35%.
2521 2018-09-18 00:12:47 I don't trade stocks but I quit bottom picking a long time ago.. I can recall only once being being right.. felt good, problem is all the other numerous times I wasted time and money.

2523 2018-09-18 00:12:11 As an example, I wouldn’t short crypto or pot stocks, or tech, but i would recognize the price action is miscalculated.  I think the same about the general market
2524 2018-09-18 00:10:47 America's economy is booming under Pres Trump's policies of less regulations, lower taxes and better choice of jobs, Wall Street is trading on most stocks instead of just the 6 high tech companies. Like under the past failure Obama administration
