35 2018-04-09 23:58:13 All about the oil. The US wants to tax every drop used anywhere in the world. Look at the history of every country that tried to refuse to sell oil in USD and what countries that do get away with.
36 2018-04-09 23:57:57 The Koch Bros own 1000's or acres of oil sands in Alberta. The Mercers probably have funneled money to The Rebel and the NRA have ties with Canada's gun lobby. There are ways around it, that are too devious for normal honest people, like you and I, to get our heads around.

53 2018-04-09 23:55:29 Sometimes I think about "what if I had tried to join the military after high school." Then I remember that I probably wouldnt enjoy being one of the U.S.'s oil mercanaries. Rather continue wiping tables for a living. 
54 2018-04-09 23:55:15 Climate change is happening, it’s always happening, and we are contributing, but not to the extent that the media would have you believe. We can do things to minimize our impact, but not at the expense of people’s livelihoods, and not in a panic. Besides...

59 2018-04-09 23:54:46 Burning the oil to gain more horsepower? I'd say that is exactly a big factor. That sounds like "party mode."
60 2018-04-09 23:54:38 I got this car in October with 98,000 miles on it. Its now April and Im at 148,000 miles.

Oil changes every 3 weeks and the amount of gasoline Ive burned through are blowing my mind.

Its said that this business owes you nothing, but it's gonna at least buy me a new car someday.

71 2018-04-09 23:53:23 I live in a high ship-traffic area.  Met a Navy sub captain & an oil tanker captain at separate functions, asked both about autonomous ships. Both brought up saving others’ lives at sea (as examples of something autonomous boat can’t/won’t do). Cooperation req’d at sea.
72 2018-04-09 23:53:23 Isn't it best to call for moratorium on all #palmoil as much of it - perhaps over 80% is still unsustainable?

77 2018-04-09 23:52:49 @OutFrontCNN look the reason we are hated in the Middle East is because we put people in power that exploited their people so we could get the oil. If we do the right thing and put a new government in Syria.
78 2018-04-09 23:52:35 I wonder how the good people of Ontario feel about the fact that a big reason they will have to pay a federal carbon tax is so that Alberta can increase its pollution in the oil sands?
79 2018-04-09 23:52:29 That one guy last time was straight up mad at you for mentioning $UVXY. Emotional market. Metals and oil are due sometime soon. I agree. Maybe a break isn't such a bad thing though. Everyone being a cowboy you can only dodge so many bullets.
80 2018-04-09 23:52:25 I was so high I spilled my cup of lean all over myself oil spoil 
81 2018-04-09 23:52:09 It's inevitable. We live in such a  unsustainable way it's not if but when our society, government, economy will fall apart. Look at oil even of we manage to not engage in a nuclear holocaust we are dependent on a finite resource that has peaked.
82 2018-04-09 23:51:45 You only got one that Pruitt has done to destroy our drinking water, contaminating our oceans, destroying all wildlife, taking away parts of our National Monuments and Parks to allow drilling for oil. Polluting our air.
83 2018-04-09 23:51:41 Pretty frustrating to read that article. Talk about snatching defeat from the clutches of victory. Notley has nothing to be proud of, unless her goal was destruction of alberta’s oil industry.
84 2018-04-09 23:51:24 It is DELICIOUS! Now we will see how long I go without coughing. It feels good going down. Was  a little leery when measuring out the coconut oil...as it is solid but it melted nicely and mixed in well with the honey and lemon. Will be putting this in my tea, too!

92 2018-04-09 23:50:53 Oil and gas take thousands of years to be produced naturally. We are consuming at a higher rate than it can naturally reproduce. It makes no sense to continue using something so destructive and finite.

96 2018-04-09 23:50:35 The pipeline is not designed to just ship off shore though. That’s the priority for sure. But it locks gas investors into BC and the accessibility of high quality oil/gas Into BC.

102 2018-04-09 23:49:58 yes when Assad gets his country back, Yemen is returned to the people and the SAudi's GTF out of it, when the Palestinians get their land back and the US and UK butt their noses out of matters that have nothing to do with them and stop invading countries to steal their oil.
103 2018-04-09 23:49:57 Got new product for my hair (cuz long lengths require extra moisture) Anyhoop...it has olive oil in it.

#SavieShenanigans
104 2018-04-09 23:49:50 Ah, we don't rely on Syria for oil. The issue remains Assad using chemical weapons, whether now or in the past. Once the US or another country can get in there, they will confirm through soil testing & human examination. That will ultimately reveal the truth & remove speculation.
105 2018-04-09 23:49:50 So not for a humanitarian reasons NO, just Oil and Gas is all about what you are Thinking ! am kinda surprised that Statue of Liberty  is still at its place already!
106 2018-04-09 23:49:40 Nope! You're just spewing the "ethical oil" shit. I want to live post fossil fuels. Stop your addiction to easy $ and jobs.

109 2018-04-09 23:49:30 Build Canadian refineries before piprline, USA is ripping us off - world glut of oil and prices have risen $0.30 with no price increases south of border. Trudeau and Alberta are screwing us.

114 2018-04-09 23:49:20 Just found the baby oil 
115 2018-04-09 23:49:18 But if your article is dated 4/7 and it says they removed all the top soil and seeded. I’m saying that’s bullshit Bc I live in this area. My brother lives less than 15 miles from the site. Says you can smell the oil in the air literally.
116 2018-04-09 23:49:11 GK anime could be better if the studio were able to blend the 3D CGI and the 2D animations imo because in this case they're like trying so hard to mix oil and water without knowing detergent exists
117 2018-04-09 23:49:05 i'm about to wash the purple dye out of my hair and i see green poking through where the blue had faded. if i wind up an oil slick hag queen i will be very pleased.

119 2018-04-09 23:48:54 Divinity exists in the contrast. heaven and hell. water and oil. 
Maybe we all exist between the sin and the prayer. And if heaven be above us and hell beneath; perhaps we’re the savior we’ve been praying for.

122 2018-04-09 23:48:37 No we need to take care of our debt and our country! Let the rich in oil Middle East take care of themselves!
123 2018-04-09 23:48:27 Well, offshore drilling is the least safe, and of oil extracting countries, Canada has some of the better environmental protections. It's far from perfect, but most oil sources are worse

130 2018-04-09 23:47:55 does the USA have permission from the democratically elected Syrian government to maintain a military presents there? Why are we occupying the Syrian oil fields? is the USA in violation of international law? Who created ISIS? JM,HRC,BO? +G+
131 2018-04-09 23:47:40 As Che Guevara said  ‘If you tremble with indignation at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine’  well, whose side do you chose, who wants the oil, who is orchestrating it, is it Russia or the USA, Do you know for sure, prove it.

133 2018-04-09 23:47:14 Sounds like the end of Canada as a country so no point in continuing.  Time to start negotiating with BC as independent country.   No trains, trucks or oil/gas through our two provinces without tariffs.  Good luck BC...

135 2018-04-09 23:46:50 Are you joking?))) Libya does not exist as a state. At all. It is divided by local gangs who control this or that peace of land with oil field. Libya is the biggest slavery market in the World now. Libya sends more refugees to Europe than all other states...

137 2018-04-09 23:46:40 We aren't on the verge of a civil war.  This is all just #DeepState lighting the oil wells on fire as they retreat.
138 2018-04-09 23:46:29 @jjhorgan I hope Alberta has the guts to stop all oil/gas shipments to BC. Then we can see how much we actually depend on pipelines. Without all the gas that comes from Edmonton our vehicles won't move and our planes won't fly...would you finally be happy then?¿ @RachelNotley
139 2018-04-09 23:46:21 I love being suddenly summon to work so i don’t have change of clothes and I accidentally got an oil stain on my svt sweat shirt 
140 2018-04-09 23:46:15 I hope if the government approves this they will allow the same on the east coast and stand up to Quebec and allow Nfld hydro accross That province and oil to NB
141 2018-04-09 23:46:14 You've got to check your stats, man. Also you're actually the one who wants natural resources (oil, etc) to continue... Smartening up is taking action against injustices. These people deserve consequence, but I want to know why it's being suggested criminal charges be laid.

144 2018-04-09 23:46:06 I hate coconut so much & it's EVERYWHERE . Hair need washing? Coconut shampoo. Thirsty? Have a Coconut water. Frying something? Coconut oil. Skin dry? Slather yourself in Coconut oil.

145 2018-04-09 23:46:00 I miss my good old Pony had one in high school and had to oil on the ground and tires just to get it to do a break burn or even spin the tires hahahaha.
146 2018-04-09 23:45:55 Clean jobs are the future but putting aside that: This pipeline is to get oil to foreign markets so it can be sold for higher &. Not for domestic heating, driving etc needs.
147 2018-04-09 23:45:45 Or get em in olive oil
148 2018-04-09 23:45:38 Oh no ADD OIL WEN!!!!! We are all learning and improving 
149 2018-04-09 23:45:24 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
150 2018-04-09 23:45:16 Do you have no shame at all? You are blatantly corrupt and selling out your own country for big oil money. How disgusting is that?
151 2018-04-09 23:45:14 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
152 2018-04-09 23:45:05 John Swinney doesn't set oil policy and extraction costs are comparable to Norway

154 2018-04-09 23:44:55 @kevintaftab Ph.D. Business has recently released "Oil's Deep State: How the petroleum industry undermines democracy and stops action on global warming - in Alberta and in Ottawa" . A succinct and factually supported analysis. Disturbing 
155 2018-04-09 23:44:55 I'm back to my full time job and away from markets every single day.
 I hate it. I do short vol with $uvxy puts when I can get to it. (don't everyone lecture me please)   haha
I see a silver, natgas , and oil trade forming but when I'm not around realtime my trades are longterm
156 2018-04-09 23:44:53 We should not finance coal or nuclear power.  Nat gas is cleaner, cheaper and can help wean the US off the OIL teat...until renewables take over.
157 2018-04-09 23:44:40 @OpenMilitary He can't save Syrians from Assad. He only can reserve lands rich for oil. While doing that, his soldiers may rape women,kill children and steal money. Are these fantasies?No.Iraq isn't too far away.1 million pp died one way or another. Thousands of women got raped.
158 2018-04-09 23:44:02 Sure hope no one fell for your and Trump's political theater over the oil drilling off Florida coasts.   You became quite concerned about the FL environment in the last 6 months after promoting its exploitation/destruction for 7.5 years
159 2018-04-09 23:43:56 Enough new legislation and patting themselves on court victories, time to tell the rcmp to enforce the law at the oil blockade protests.
160 2018-04-09 23:43:36 Replace "reported" with "alleged". The Golan Heights is the objective. Israel needs US forces to secure that oil reserve with billions of barrels to be tapped. The RAND corporation is overseeing the mission. Why would they care about civilian casualties? False Flag op.

165 2018-04-09 23:43:15 "i have oil in my backyard" 
166 2018-04-09 23:43:14 There's a number of humanitarian problems with pipelines as a whole, let alone this pipeline, which would invalidate other people's livelihoods. Nobody wants your oil being dumped into the BC coastline; sod off with it.
167 2018-04-09 23:43:11 If you're used to cutting your diesel fuel with waste engine oil and waste atf, you should be able to manage this.

It might be really bad for you, but so are occupying forces.

170 2018-04-09 23:43:05 What about Standing Rock. Did you have the right ? To put an oil pipeline through there that LEAKED LESS THAN A WEEK LATER???

176 2018-04-09 23:42:36 Yes this is horrible and so is the gator hunting in the US. The Inuit use the seal meat, fat, fur and oil, so even if the commercial seal hunting is stopped the First Nations people will still be able to hunt as part of their culture.
177 2018-04-09 23:42:24 why are you so obsessed with this shitty pipeline? The writing on the wall is pretty clear: pipelines are not safe enough to bank on them not rupturing and covering the earth in oil. You're willing to destroy more native land and push our environment further down for what?
178 2018-04-09 23:42:13 We do have a great opportunity spotlighting the various technologies to replace oil and how that is in the National Interest.

We are not wasting it 
179 2018-04-09 23:42:11 And that's why sewage is treated as bad as oil products when spilled . Where I work but it's completely acceptable for a city to dump it hmmmmmmmmmm. Double standard ?
180 2018-04-09 23:42:03 Most modern stuff, after the era of PCBs, seems to have a viscosity of about 50cS. While that is much thicker than diesel (3-5cS) it compares favorably with #4 fuel oil (36cS) and hydraulic oil (43cS). Much thinner than 10wt motor oil (110cS).

184 2018-04-09 23:41:49 most la place i’ve been in a while: “in line for cbd oil between two horny australian teens and a mom from Simi Valley”
185 2018-04-09 23:41:44 Don’t put all BCers in same boat, I and many northern BC wanted this pipeline, not only for the work but for Canada....selling our oil to the US at a loss because your oil is landlocked is insane
186 2018-04-09 23:41:43 The sooner the oil finish the sooner our Syrian bros & sisters will have peaceful life.
187 2018-04-09 23:41:36 Incredible! Another oil producer country...
188 2018-04-09 23:41:11 Drop 2-3 drops off an oil you like the smell of onto them, let it sink in and dry for a few hours, then use with your laundry as normal!
189 2018-04-09 23:41:09 FYI: If you eat any food w/rapeseed oil....rapeseed has high levels of erucic acid, which is not soluble in water. #DoNotEat #GROI YWxo.
190 2018-04-09 23:41:07 Back to ACV and organic coconut oil for my skincare.
191 2018-04-09 23:41:05 There is an oil for that 
192 2018-04-09 23:40:59 One of my dearest friends and fellow workers made me some Come To Me oil and hunny I used it today..... Whew
193 2018-04-09 23:40:53 How many seats do the Liberals have in BC in comparison to the province of Saskatchewan?  So the Alberta government is forced to send oil in the United States at 50% discount and the Americans double the price when they ship it up to Canada through NB.
194 2018-04-09 23:40:50 I be having the whole house smelling like tea tree oil
195 2018-04-09 23:40:47 alsO im so happy bc i think acutane is reALLY working well for me like i havent experienced any of the bad side effects (((yet???))) and my face isnt covered in oil by the end of the day thaNK
196 2018-04-09 23:40:38 Unfortunately, I doubt it. They oil the eggs to prevent them from hatching. Cruel!
197 2018-04-09 23:40:35 Investors shifted back towards growth in overnight trading. Oil and base metals rallied as stocks posted gains, and bonds sold off @MicMcCarthy_CMC
198 2018-04-09 23:40:27 A born-and-raised Edmontonian/Albertan now living in Vancouver, who also understands economic importance of oil to Alberta because it FAILED to diversify for many years, I’m sad to read you seem to want to ram pipeline through when NO CLEAR party established to cleanup spills?
199 2018-04-09 23:40:26 I think I actually posted it a year or so ago. Along with "We're going to need some duck tape, some zip ties, a gallon of peanut oil, and two rubber chickens."

202 2018-04-09 23:40:19 I just said out loud "Holy shit!" That painting is amazing! Thank you for sharing! I'm terrified to try oil because of the wait time. I'm a fairly antsy person and the idea of waiting days for a piece to dry before I can continue working on it sounds like torture!

206 2018-04-09 23:39:55 How do you know? Before the advent of easy oil money our Native Authorities (NA)
used the instrument of poll tax to extort money out of the poor, some of who went on exile for being unable to pay. And the Emirs & their acolytes still lived big even by todays standards

209 2018-04-09 23:39:45 I boiled em for the first 2 weeks but got pretty bored of em so I started frying them with just a little bit of olive oil, & my doctor said adding hot sauce to them was fine so I’ve been eating em like that haha

228 2018-04-09 23:38:04 Your delusional if you think anyone gives a dam about your plan Victor as far as climate change  I don't trust the snake oil salesmen who push it .
229 2018-04-09 23:37:59 Okay i will give you that, it is BBC of course. Assad is a B*stard as much as the rest..none of them are decent, The West is backing Isreal as it wants the Oil & Gas!

234 2018-04-09 23:37:25 I'll leave you with. We cannot condemn the Oil Sands in the name of Climate Change, when our solution to our oil dependency is to import our requirements. 
That doesn't absolve our environmental responsibility.
235 2018-04-09 23:37:06 The US invades other countries for oil bih
236 2018-04-09 23:37:00 Just the oil down, screw them.

238 2018-04-09 23:36:51 Id rather bathe in olive oil and get the same results 
239 2018-04-09 23:36:36 You call for a pipeline and allow USA to increase Canadian fuel prices by $0.30 /ltr. When it's our oil. Fuck  Kindrmorgan and the Chinese,  focus on the Canadian  pricing , gas didn't go up $1.20/gal. In usa
240 2018-04-09 23:36:27 SCOMO the Snake oil merchant. Not worth the air he breathes.
241 2018-04-09 23:36:04 does peppermint oil cause you issues? I've got asthma and we use it in the bathroom at work, and it doesn't set mine off the way a lot of commercial air fresheners do.
242 2018-04-09 23:35:39 Most of the middle east has been war pawns of Euro American interests based around oil. Military Keynsian proxy war that keeps millions in well paid work. 

When the oil runs out the West will walk away. 

Leaving a land in the middle that can never fit into the jigsaw?

247 2018-04-09 23:34:25 When OIL is sent to United States from Mexico, there is a Tariff to be paid of 18-20%. When oil is sent to Mexico from United States there is a Tariff to be paid of 50%. Does that sound like a FAIR TRADE... NO, IT´S A STUPID TRADE!!!!! Also going for years....

257 2018-04-09 23:33:47 @RachelNotley I live in Vancouver but stand with Alberta, PLEASE shut off all fuel/oil shipments to BC. If these environmentalists hate pipelines so much show them what its like to live without them @jkenney

267 2018-04-09 23:31:45 Nagode dear
268 2018-04-09 23:31:42 I believe it's a combination of higher extraction costs and lower oil taxes, as insisted on by Mr John Swinney of the SNP, that account for the difference.
269 2018-04-09 23:31:36 personally I am not angry at refugees, Janice may see this different, however, her message about #Trudeau is clear, he is a rotten spoiled useless toy selected by big greedy corporations eg #Oil your last sentence I do not understand, "copy it"? Janice & I have a common goal
270 2018-04-09 23:31:35 The US government should support the green energy nationwide and slow down our dependence on the oil!

281 2018-04-09 23:30:34 I'm not so sure shipping the oil off shore will help our gas prices.
282 2018-04-09 23:30:33 I don't understand how this isn't treasonous. bullying the indigenous and BC for the interests of an AMERICAN oil company. it breaks my heart and makes me sick.
283 2018-04-09 23:30:28 i know it’s a fact lol i just never liked them together. they’re like oil and water to me.

285 2018-04-09 23:30:21 What if there are people that are paid to make traffic jams. So the big oil companies can get more fuel money from the fuel you waste. 
286 2018-04-09 23:30:20 give me your headcanons about the unopneed bottle of olive oil from aldi sitting on my countertop
287 2018-04-09 23:30:03 Oh. So as long as it's not in your country, it doesn't count? It isn't a dangerous game. Supporting Canadian oil is supporting divestment, supports equality. Supports the BS climate change agendas. 
Do you buy conflict diamonds?

293 2018-04-09 23:29:25 Doesn't seem a hugely relevant thing to say unless you've noted all the TV failures in economy also
294 2018-04-09 23:29:15 In Israel? No oil whatsoever. You’re on pure fiction there. 

Daniel’s dad a”h was an oil man if I remember right. No oil in Israel. Some in Sinai. A little just found in Golan.
295 2018-04-09 23:29:14 Just changed the oil in my truck in the garage. Went 2000 miles over by accident. Good thing I’m handy with vehicles  and actually enjoy working on them.
296 2018-04-09 23:29:09 My new favourite meme is the US Army oil thing
297 2018-04-09 23:29:01 The political hackery, bias and blatant obvious corruption here is astounding considering Republicans control everything. WTF?
298 2018-04-09 23:28:50 He may or may not be a mad man, I don’t know or care. Here’s what I do know.  He has pipelines, he is allied with Russia, We don’t want them controlling said pipelines (bc we are too influence by Libs to drill for our own damn oil), We want Him out. So, I’m skeptical 
299 2018-04-09 23:28:48 I need to find me some medicated oil for my hair , so i can get it braided.
300 2018-04-09 23:28:43 No facts - i've given you charts - you have said 'Scottish oil inn that good and companies own it' - that's just nonsense!
301 2018-04-09 23:28:17 Then you need to adjust your redline. My redline is buying oil from countries that stones women and gays. My redline is supporting equality. My redline is not supporting terrorist organization that sell women (and worse).
302 2018-04-09 23:28:09 Aw that’s so sweet, she probs can’t wait either! I use a hair mask after I wash the coconut oil off w shampoo bc it helps get the remaining oil residue out. This process made my hair grow SO long n I miss that (n need it) bc hair just got chopped
303 2018-04-09 23:27:56 Ranu doesn't like Oil On Water.. I need a moment.
304 2018-04-09 23:27:48 Obviously there us much more oil in larger ones.

But much, much more danger.

Still, if you need petroleum base or fuel oil bad enough...

306 2018-04-09 23:27:35 PBS News Hour. Linda Hogan, indigenous writer, has novel about the oil boom in Oklahoma entitled Mean Spirit. It has a difficult publishing history and it needs attention. This book was a Pultizer finalist, was sold to new publishers without the author's consent.
307 2018-04-09 23:27:30 Coconut Oil&Hemp Lotion are my favorite things 
308 2018-04-09 23:27:18 Premier...is this not the Minister that was holding the activist sign destroying our Oil industry? Were you not standing behind her in support? Your government has no credibility left!
309 2018-04-09 23:27:16 You've just been brainwashed into accepting that the oil industry get special treatment. I'm trying to get you to see just how irrational and unreasonable it all is.
310 2018-04-09 23:27:07 We sold the most pristine coast line to the highest bidder   Lots of people have prospered but the next generation sold out.   All Canada needs is our fresh clean water refine our own oil, & lumber. We have everything. Please don’t sell it all. Oh to late
311 2018-04-09 23:27:02 Best of luck
312 2018-04-09 23:26:47 I showed Jordan the body lava yesterday and he real life told me to just rub some coconut oil on myself and spinkle some glitter

314 2018-04-09 23:26:36 hey guys welcome back to my channel today we’re putting mango la croix in an oil diffuser like and subscribe below
315 2018-04-09 23:26:18 If by national interest you mean the interests of an American oil company’s profit margin, you’re right!
316 2018-04-09 23:26:10 Yeeee yeeee eat em up! But the olive oil still leaves a good taste but a lot healthier
317 2018-04-09 23:26:05 This is very important. The different approach on oil nationalization in #Iran & #SaudiArabia has also had a direct impact on where both #NIOC and #SaudiAramco are standing today.
318 2018-04-09 23:25:39 Rub some avacado oil on that pan instead of spraying 
319 2018-04-09 23:25:35 Is the Trudeau government's real agenda to NATIONALIZE / ACQUIRE Alberta's oil and gas industry? Now that they've all but destroyed it and slashed company valuations, that may be the end game. If so, it would be entirely in keeping with Trudeau's anti-Alberta world view.
320 2018-04-09 23:25:31 Would they real threaten to close down bc fossil fuel expansion re #bclng because of our lack of support for a Fossil fuel oil pipeline?

Come on. Get the popcorn out.
321 2018-04-09 23:25:28 You're completely off your trolley, totally ignorant about economics, the EU, oil and probably everything else on planet Earth, assuming you're on planet Earth.
322 2018-04-09 23:25:25 @DBChirpy nope. Only oil companies and gun makers. @gop has moved so far right they have fallen off the conservative spectrum.

325 2018-04-09 23:25:14 I’m not tryna Pay $90 for an oil change again.. like I will literally ride my shit until it’s on 1%
326 2018-04-09 23:25:11 Yes! That would’ve been MOST convenient seeing that he was FLYING AROUND (but not using any form of transportation that requires OIL!)in Western Canada! You  blew it again, Boy Blunder!
327 2018-04-09 23:25:08 I’m always disgusted by the charade of hauling a commercial company executive.....pharma companies, bankers, oil company, Facebook...name your industry...in for a public flogging in a congressional hearing.
328 2018-04-09 23:25:07 You and your partisan political hackery is our greatest danger. You know this whole thing  stinks but your eager to use it to destroy Trump
329 2018-04-09 23:25:02 I’m doing a crossword waiting for an oil change pretty sure I’m a senior citizen now
330 2018-04-09 23:24:50 Really hoping @GeorgeHeyman making plans for BC to follow other jurisdictions in getting off oil, not just because it reduces power of AB to cajole, but because it's also the right thing to do. #bcpoli
331 2018-04-09 23:24:50 If you don't live in South Dakota in the area of the XL Pipeline, be thankful. It has sprung a major leak of that nasty tar Sands oil.

The pipeline isn't that old it & should not be springing leaks.
332 2018-04-09 23:24:48 He's been losing money ever since the price of oil halved in early 2015. We haven't seen any sizeable investments since; our net spend has been more similar to mid-table clubs. We have been outbid by top clubs fee/wages for nearly every big name transfer target...
333 2018-04-09 23:24:42 Here's a bottle of holy oil, you do the rest.
334 2018-04-09 23:24:33 I'm sticking with Syria. Everything else is BS right now. They are trying very hard to lead us into war with Iran. We stole their oil in '53. They took it back in '79, and they've been the target ever since.
335 2018-04-09 23:24:27 Russia is weaker than most think. Their economy is shit outside of oil, their military isn’t that great. Sanctions have Hurt them badly. 
Iran has some Military there but not strong presence. 
Israel could do it, but with how they feel about Assad, they may take him out

338 2018-04-09 23:24:02 Your comments are nonsensical. Railcars have a finite capacity issue. You're assuming that, without as much oil to haul, people will loss work. I'm stating that oil is pushing other products out. With less oil comes more room for the products that are dependent on rail.
339 2018-04-09 23:23:49 See tourism if people boycott BC tourism. Boycott BC products. Shut off oil taps to BC.
340 2018-04-09 23:23:44 Hahah 'Scottish oil is worthless and not as good quality' --- hahha - sort of same for some Unionists.
341 2018-04-09 23:23:39 Also, not a written assignment, but I do the oil pricing game to introduce rational actor and game theory.

343 2018-04-09 23:23:18 And there is next to no tax revenue because oil companies have massive expensive to offset against profits and because Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies - which he did. So no, no significant tax revenues from oil.
344 2018-04-09 23:23:12 You have no way of knowing how the Bahrain find will impact the price of oil. Horizontal drilling and fracking shale oil from ocean platforms isn't cheap. It will be many years before the field is even developed.
345 2018-04-09 23:23:01 Hey kids! Oil your mom up! Daddy got a raise!

353 2018-04-09 23:21:54 That is one of the best thing that can happen to a country like Ven, oil output has taken the elevator down, so corrupted individuals cannot use the industry for their own benefit and it will contribute to squeeze the regime of Maduro, this yr alone PDVSA needs to pay almost 9B.
354 2018-04-09 23:21:47 'Poor quality and worthless' - it's from the same beds as Norwegian oil you absolut fruit cake.
355 2018-04-09 23:21:31 Well, that’ll be worth it then. A country poorer in every respect for decades so that UK olive oil producers can use traditional urns.

Oh, hang on.

360 2018-04-09 23:20:57 Hola Lerato !! Thank you. We will wait you.
361 2018-04-09 23:20:39 Would you please address the fact that the protests in BC are being led by First Nations, whose unceded territories are being invaded by a foreign oil company? I have noticed you and PM Trudeau have avoided this issue.
362 2018-04-09 23:20:38 The key is not to do too much. If you start with a fresh, delicious book, then really a little salt, pepper, and good olive oil is all you need!
363 2018-04-09 23:20:38 Eat two servings of salad or green veggies a couple of times a day, and one serving of the others.  Eat a lot of "good" protein & fat, stuff like fish, chicken, beef, avocados, almonds, walnuts, olives/olive oil, eggs, etc.
364 2018-04-09 23:20:37 The point that nobody will sign term contracts at $80/bbl is asinine. That's not how the market works. Nobody would sign that deal for any grade of oil. Nor does oil price dictate pipeline economics when supply exceeds takeaway capacity.
365 2018-04-09 23:20:32 That's much like I thought when I saw the Prices for Midnight Oil's reunion tour last Year.

372 2018-04-09 23:19:58 Just need Derby contenders named Vegetable Oil, Maltodextrin, Monosodium Glutamate (>18 oops), Onion Powder, etc, etc!!
373 2018-04-09 23:19:56 Thats what y’all say. Just be transparent enough to show us how much money we have in the excess crude oil account ECA for the last two years alone. Let us be the judges , not the brainwashed presidency who would call white a black.
374 2018-04-09 23:19:40 Oh. So oil companies sell something that doesn’t belong to them and make a profit?
How does that work?
375 2018-04-09 23:19:39 You can't answer that can you. The SNP have got nothing to do with the management and taxation of oil production, that is all down to the inept mismanagement of Westminster. Energy policy is reserved.

380 2018-04-09 23:19:05 It does not matter how many times you Canadians jump up and down.  It does not matter how much smoke comes out of your Canadian ears.  BC will *never* allow your dirty oil over our waters. *Ever.* *No matter what.*
381 2018-04-09 23:19:04 Of course you need different cars to haul different products. If a finite capacity is used for oil, because it is more profitable (?), then you don't have enough capacity to haul grain. What didn't I understand?

387 2018-04-09 23:18:05  lol ...hmm but I apply witch hazel to my face everyday along w/ a moisturizer for oily skin, or sometimes vitamin e or lavender oil. I exfoliate like maybe twice a week. Try to not touch my face a lot or have hair rubbing against it.

394 2018-04-09 23:17:43 @jasoncundy05 there is an oil that you can buy over the counter, you simply apply it twice a day and within 2 weeks, you wont even notice when it falls off
395 2018-04-09 23:17:40 Douma is the only place that kiked isis in the first place , on the the other hand just google from whome the assad regaim was buying oil?? Who was funding isis by buying from them.

401 2018-04-09 23:17:02 In 2004 and 2005 when it was clear that an oil shock was on the way, I was engaged in an online discussion with energy policy gurus. The positive options and related inherent synergies for wind+solar+EVs+batteries were clear even then. Now the primary barriers are political.

406 2018-04-09 23:16:19 The only difference in regulations here are the Canadian pilots. The technology is the same and the ships themselves are almost always the same. Just last week an oil tanker lost power and had to drop an emergency anchor. Shit happens. Increasing that risk is not worth it.
407 2018-04-09 23:16:15 Buy them marinated in oil if you like those kind of things, or make them stuffed with breadcrumbs and cheese 
408 2018-04-09 23:15:58 Hey ! I’m in!! Let me know when and where and I’ll bring a 5 Gallon bucket of heated oriental massage oil! ..... (Wait a minute ... sorry ... for a brief moment I was thinking about California) hey! Set me up again!!
409 2018-04-09 23:15:58 No, it isn't. Scottish oil is worth pretty much nothing in government revenue terms now. You do know that income from oil is only tax on profits? And there are massive expenses to set against profits. And the SNP begged to have tax on oil slashed, so Osborne agreed.
410 2018-04-09 23:15:54 Hope you recover soon. Try taking oregano oil.
411 2018-04-09 23:15:48 So let's go kill us some people, sounds like a sane persons solution, good job no-one is advocating stopping stupid people from having access to internet with the same standard of logic. US couldn't even stop Isis moving oil about, I recon your well out a luck impeding Russia.

416 2018-04-09 23:15:00 I almost forgot to oil my edges today.
417 2018-04-09 23:14:52 Not nearly as many tax dollars are wasted on ethanol as there are wasted on big oil. Your argument is not valid.

419 2018-04-09 23:14:30 The oil companies don't own the oil, the have a licence to drill for it from the country that owns it.
420 2018-04-09 23:14:27 Seen two swans covered in oil when I took the baby to feed the ducks, so I rang the rspca & they called me to say they've been taken to a wildlife centre to be cleaned & they wouldn't of survived without my call
421 2018-04-09 23:14:24 Geographically those 22% apposed have the most to loose. Makes sense they are the ones with the biggest beef. Personally I care less about it, but my place in Merritt aint getting covered in oil if theres a spill.
422 2018-04-09 23:14:21 It’s as if the Syrian people and the country has not been punished enough they have been punished for the past seven years all in the name of oil everybody’s fighting for the oil and the poor innocent people of Syria and Iraq are paying the price

424 2018-04-09 23:14:10 I agree  that is why I retweeted it. I will be one of those medical patients in Texas in June not able to bring my medicine with me that all my doctors including cancer doctor are okay with me taking medical hemp oil and canniibas. Thank You!!!!  Bob
425 2018-04-09 23:14:09 Coconut oil all over my body 
426 2018-04-09 23:14:09 Health care in Canada cost $242 billion per year in 2017. That will be increasing. The revenue from the pipeline is less than 1% of that and decreasing as years go by. Won’t make much of a difference. Plus there are health costs of oil use and extraction.
427 2018-04-09 23:14:01 わーい

431 2018-04-09 23:13:31 Better not disappoint us 
432 2018-04-09 23:13:23 For one, all pipeline-supporting politicians should commit to working in the field cleaning up the first oil spill
433 2018-04-09 23:13:23 Correct but at some point cutting off oil/gas becomes necessary to send a clear message to everyone that Alberta has had it!
434 2018-04-09 23:13:17 Haven’t been using powder my skins been way too dry lately:(((  went from using powder base to oil based and still can’t find any good ones;(
435 2018-04-09 23:13:11 Check what the wealthy & corporations get from the tax cut & compare it to your $800. In order to pay for the huge tax cut for the wealthy & corporations he increased the national debt by over one trillion. Keep drinking the snake oil.

442 2018-04-09 23:12:19 So this means a lot of people did spot the arm bundle and yes the Lion of Judah oil
443 2018-04-09 23:12:09 US is dependent on the global oil trade being conducted in  USD to ensure global demand for US currency remains high enough to keep it inflated and set as the defacto world trade currency.

The US is in this for its own interests, your standard of living is dependent on this too.
444 2018-04-09 23:11:56 Funny that you didn’t spot Obama as the snake oil salesmen that he was.

456 2018-04-09 23:10:24 If this happens Obama/Hillary will have fulfilled their goal and removed Assad at all cost. Yes just like Libya their is Oil/Gas but the tragedy will start when the Syrian Gov is removed- Syria is secular  Jews Christians Shiite Sunni Muslims -allsorts- orchestrated propoganda

461 2018-04-09 23:10:01 Does “being a fart catcher for big oil” apply to anyone who doesn’t agree with you?  Hopefully you gave your students a more objective perspective...

463 2018-04-09 23:09:54 @SenJohnBarrasso Hate the lack of ethics in repug party to expand illegalities in mining, oil and filthy industries, auto emissions.

464 2018-04-09 23:09:49 ALBERTA would make a great replacement. Oil, water farm land and c9nservative people.  Trudope is killing us.

472 2018-04-09 23:08:39 I hope we can make an oil deal with Washington state, and stop buying our oil from Alberta. Yank that leverage right out of Alberta's hands. #transmountian #bcpoli #cdnpoli

We had enough. And u r only talking about oil. Is this humanity to yoy. ?!?! U should really be ashamed of such word

481 2018-04-09 23:07:44 I think it's a salad dressing made with red wine vinegar and mustard and oil.
482 2018-04-09 23:07:44 The way YOU can do your part is: Do not use any fossil based company products. Recruit likeminded and live happily after!

Proven/data driven = techniques / strategies that have worked in similar contexts & enable long term change in memory.Twitter is awash with gurus selling snake oil, e.g.  edutainment that doesn't educate, it engages for engagements sake.
486 2018-04-09 23:06:50 ‘Liberals’ care more about Trump’s sex life than they do about his threats of mass murder for oil that could lead to WW3. Bunch of spineless morons. Ugh. Those who STILL aren’t speaking out against imperialism, are a lost cause.
487 2018-04-09 23:06:42 Thinking about getting lash extensions too but idk. I use oil on m face a lot and I heard that’s what fuck them up and make them fall out
488 2018-04-09 23:06:39 That is one of the dumbest articles yet to come out regarding the Alberta oil industry. The economic assumptions it makes in support of its premise isn't at the level of a first year undergraduate. McKay is an environmental reporter who gave up and now writes children's books...
489 2018-04-09 23:06:29 Ahhh bueh se desmadro todo lpqlp es champagne contra gas oil 
490 2018-04-09 23:06:12 Seems to me that the point being made here is that the #USD becomes de-linked from #oil but will take a long time (and a substitute) to erase network effects of #USD as primary reserve. Thus, #USD becomes more directly linked to current account trade flows beyond oil. No?
491 2018-04-09 23:05:55 15 year old me would be very disappointed that I just halved the olive oil content on my fucking roasted beets because I didn’t want them to be too terribly bad for me.

495 2018-04-09 23:05:25 Trump claims the #SDNY #FBI #raid on #MichaelCohen's locations are "a real disgrace" and "an attack on our country." 

Actually, the FBI is DEFENDING our country from "a real disgrace", AKA snake oil salesman Trump as POTUS.
496 2018-04-09 23:05:22 Every high school should have a mandatory class called “LIFE”which teaches you how to: sew, change a tire/oil, do taxes, basic first aid, basic cooking skills, and communication skills, etc. Basic things that you need to survive in this world that are lost as of now.
497 2018-04-09 23:05:03 right, because oil workers are the ONLY resource workers in Canada. I like how u are pretending to be behind the handful of workers who would benefit from the pipeline. I think we all know it's the company u support.

514 2018-04-09 23:03:07 Yep and @GovAbbott might be able to court all of our oil companies to move their HQs to Houston and get our drillers too. I am not sure what other companies are HQ’ed here.

519 2018-04-09 23:02:51 The auto industry? Or the oil industry?
520 2018-04-09 23:02:42 Hell, you don't even have to look at it on a per capita basis; the answer is none. Of course Canada ranks below other affluent countries in Europe that have few or zero oil and gas reserves.
521 2018-04-09 23:02:42 Dept. of Revenue: The original goal of the tax credits was to expand the development of our oil and gas resources. "Alaska is not competitive" if it fails to reimburse companies that invested in good faith. #akleg

Not being there right now is not a reason to stop progressing toward that goal.

536 2018-04-09 23:00:37 The threat is encroachment in the Golan Heights region. Research Genie Oil in Syria and take a look at the Board of Directors. Gears will begin turning.
537 2018-04-09 23:00:29 They didn't give me any chili oil. Just some brown sauce *Which was so good * and a bottle of  Sriracha hot sauce. I didn't need it tho. The fresh jalapenos lit my mouth up 
538 2018-04-09 23:00:17 the problem with this statement is that it implys Alberta's ONLY industry is Oil. Is it though? Really?
539 2018-04-09 23:00:12 no problem, these syrians are coming to canada, and the arms trade of the united states will increase, like the gasoline in the world, enriching the big oil companies

554 2018-04-09 22:59:06 I get those. My current hypotheses for the causes of mine are
- Prolonged narrowing of the field of visual attention
- Eating chili suspended in oil (concievable that the capsaicin is getting places it shouldn't and causing inflamation)
Experiments look good so far.

562 2018-04-09 22:58:27 We could be M(aking)AGA but instead...oil! To be more specific, Genie Oil in the Golan Heights of Syria. A couple of prominent names on the board of directors for Genie Oil: Rupert Murdoch, Dick Cheney, James Woolsey, and others...
563 2018-04-09 22:58:25 Where can I get an oil change for cheap?
564 2018-04-09 22:58:25 こんなの毎日やってたら体壊すよなあ
565 2018-04-09 22:58:16 What's puzzling is Trump have no proof Syria is responsible for the attack !? In addition, Syria and the other Muslim countries attacked for oil had no reports of ever chemically attacking their people until 9/11/2001, Hmmmmmmm ???????
566 2018-04-09 22:58:10 The other day at the dollar store, this old man was frantically shoving jars of coconut oil into several baskets, and when he saw me staring at him, he stopped and yelled “IT’S FOR A RECEIPE!!” And then ran to the check out line and he is making drugs I’m sure of it.
567 2018-04-09 22:57:59 Simple. Burning oil CO2 and climate change
568 2018-04-09 22:57:50 What about Gab?
569 2018-04-09 22:57:48 $91.00 for a fucking oil change I’m so ready to get rid of this high ass car
570 2018-04-09 22:57:45 1-Ott
2-Buf
3- da Oil
571 2018-04-09 22:57:36 Without thinking too hard I could name half a dozen countries where human rights are violated on a daily basis, why don't we go after those countries? 
A. Oil
B. We sell them arms
C. They'd bite back
D. All the above
572 2018-04-09 22:57:35 Daily Trains & Semi’s haul dangerous deadly toxic chemicals east from BC through prairie cities & towns. Crashes & derailments have happened causing mass evacuations. BC doesn’t give a damn about it or oil benefit to they illegally protest twinning an existing safe pipeline.
573 2018-04-09 22:57:33 Plenty of work in reclaiming the land damaged by oil production.If govt really wants to provide jobs, this is an industry in waiting.  Instead of subsidizing the oil industry the same $$ could be go into cleaning up the mess & shifting to a green economy. #abpoli #cdnpoli
574 2018-04-09 22:57:26 Kinder Morgan isn't in the oil extraction business.
575 2018-04-09 22:57:26 it's not the pressure cooker that makes strong individuals, it's the individuals with a strong anchor (sense of being) that are willing and able to make it through to the end when the pressure is released
576 2018-04-09 22:57:20 Gross I have a layer of oil on my nose. Why am I so oily?!
577 2018-04-09 22:57:19 BC gets most of its oil from Washington State not Alberta.  Impossible to put bitumen in your gas tank.
578 2018-04-09 22:57:09 Take the oil?
579 2018-04-09 22:57:04 Billions are mere schillings to the oil industry.
580 2018-04-09 22:57:02 週5で1限。クソ。
581 2018-04-09 22:57:00 It’s just business bruh. He looking for that oil money
582 2018-04-09 22:56:58 111 Delta communities threaten to shut down oil field
583 2018-04-09 22:56:45 BOBA. ITS TAPIOCA BALLS. ANYTIME YOU HAVE BOBA, THEY GIVE YOU A FAT STRAW TO GET THE BOBA. HAHAHAHAHA  OOPS. NOW YOU KNOW. THIS PHO LOOKS DELICIOUS. I ADD A LOT OF CHILI OIL IN MINE
584 2018-04-09 22:56:35 It doesn’t have to be a must though. Like they’re selling off their oil, Canadian oil, and forcing it to be purchased back from foreign refineries—all at the profit of big money. Makes no sense, I guess other than jobs, but that’s decreased recently.
585 2018-04-09 22:56:28 I'm not one to wish ill will towards anyone, BUT when you are a snake oil salesman... #MichaelCohen #happymonday
586 2018-04-09 22:56:18 Im game to try anything if it works! Planning to give some of these a go tonight. Gonna lay there with my white noise, my herb tea, lavender oil, old books to read, new books to plot...im getting sleepy just thinking about it all! 
587 2018-04-09 22:56:11 Russian oil company, it's really fucked up and should be dismantled.

I'm not a fan of massive oil companies, to say the least.
588 2018-04-09 22:56:09 อาจจะเป็นพี่ลีไงพี่ออย5555
589 2018-04-09 22:55:49 So whose Tony Robbins and why is he attacking women?  My daughters say he is the snake oil salesman of our generation.  Oh, that lunatic!   Thought he disappeared years ago.  The Flim-Fam Man.

591 2018-04-09 22:55:39 The surplus is now going by rail (less safe)& the reality is oil will be around for 50  years. Energy diversity is whats needed as we switch reliance from one major source to another.
592 2018-04-09 22:55:35 @jackieaina sooooo I see in this body lava video I see that Sol de Janerio glow oil behind you...could we get a comparison video with those two? Or some comparison swatches?
593 2018-04-09 22:55:15 Just like the keystone pipeline. Has already leaked 1000 barrels of oil. Cutting regulations causes cutting corners which is bad for environment and workers
594 2018-04-09 22:55:14 Yes, because they both plan to expand and share the land that was once Syria, as soon as they succeed in their material support to destroy the Assad regime.

More land for Israel, oil/gas pipeline to Mediterranean for Saudi Arabia.
595 2018-04-09 22:55:07  that heartbreaking moment when you've stocked up on essentials then you rem your vatika oil  keni better be gone by tmrw!  
596 2018-04-09 22:55:00 We don’t burn oil for electricity, we do burn natural gas! They are two different fuels!
597 2018-04-09 22:54:56 I'll bring you grapeseed oil tomorrow.
598 2018-04-09 22:54:52 Can you admit that importing oil needs does not actually change the global GHG emissions? If Canada can meet the BS Paris goals, but other countries can't (because we are importing their products), what's the point? It's a global commitment.
599 2018-04-09 22:54:40 More than AB, they are killing all of the provs with oil & gas
600 2018-04-09 22:54:38 We're watching House Resources today for House Bill 331, the oil tax credit reimbursement bill. Stay tuned. #akleg

Home Region game tomorrow 4pm vs Oil City
603 2018-04-09 22:54:24 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
604 2018-04-09 22:54:19 Like, I want to?? But I use coconut oil and a simple foaming cleanser and it does the trick and its SO cheap like I just cant be bothered
605 2018-04-09 22:54:13 I LOVE making my own popcorn but use Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
606 2018-04-09 22:54:10 As much as I love you Mayor Nenshi, I'm concerned that your statement is all about short term economic gain. No mention of our climate change goals, or of the fact that in a couple decades (or less) no one will be buying our oil
607 2018-04-09 22:53:55 here you go lying again, it is because there is no market for tarsands oil,there does not seem to be trouble with crude oil markets Jaasson. GET YOUR LIES STRAIT

609 2018-04-09 22:53:43 The war in Syria has one giant and simple explanation; who gets to run the oil pipeline through it. Us, or Russia. Yes, Trump really is that dumb. #TYTLive
610 2018-04-09 22:53:33 BC can just buy more oil from the gas station problem solved.
611 2018-04-09 22:53:28 Oil or bitumen? 

And yes, of course a pipeline would be a more efficient way to ship grain.

How about beverages? Let's build a pipeline for Coca cola or Molson?
612 2018-04-09 22:53:25 witch hazel + tee tree oil =

614 2018-04-09 22:53:22 Put a couple drops of clary sage oil in my ginger tea. Apparently it combats menstrual cramps naturally.

616 2018-04-09 22:53:06 We will need a bottle of anointing oil, the mantle, the communion and feet washing items to perform a deliverance session on a sister that has gone mad...
617 2018-04-09 22:53:01 OIL
618 2018-04-09 22:52:39 I noticed that.  During the selloff crude held at 63.38.  I was wondering if the oil market was broken or maybe the batteries died
619 2018-04-09 22:52:38 Oh, I guess the Gulf of Mexico isn't tidewater; my bad! I guess Texas doesn't have some of the largest ports and oil export terminals in the world... Just shut the fuck up you ignorant sack of shit.
620 2018-04-09 22:52:30 Hey, there’s like at least a little baby powder to dull the shine of all the oil.
621 2018-04-09 22:52:23 Really annoying buying oil based foundations with no spf on them and presuming there’s non to find out there’s a huge flashback:)))
622 2018-04-09 22:52:23 I've been using cbd/thc oil for my recovery from an open liver op. Helps massively with sleep too. Good luck man!

628 2018-04-09 22:51:23 The 1970's  #Uranium price increased more than tenfold from $3 to $43. Some #Uranium stocks shot up by 100. Nuclear power use was the driver compared to high oil prices. Accidents like Three Mile Island and then Chernobyl stopped the bulls as well as new production.

630 2018-04-09 22:51:11 prevention: don’t touch or mess with the facial inflammation

632 2018-04-09 22:50:58 The terrorists are getting them from the US and Israel. They are waging a proxy war. This is the Oded Yinon/ Thomas PM Barnett plan. It's a set up because IS were almost eradicated and the war brokers and oil corporatists need to maintain the war.
633 2018-04-09 22:50:37 SYRIA HAZ OIL end of story

636 2018-04-09 22:50:09 And it is also worth pointing out it has to remain in the ground if to prevent climate change. It is also worth pointing out US is not dependent on Middle East oil. #oil #climate
637 2018-04-09 22:50:05 If you have to govern by force, then you lose the right to lead.  Bringing the army to BC will only backfire on Alberta, Big Oil and Ottawa.  Harper and Trudeau failed to get consent.
638 2018-04-09 22:49:51 This weekend, it's going to be 70 degrees & I have no oil pens. Someone help me !
639 2018-04-09 22:49:27 Quick give Michael Moore a few million dollars to make a film about Syria's oil fields or a pipeline or some other diversionary shit..

642 2018-04-09 22:49:17 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
643 2018-04-09 22:49:13 Lmaooo niggas ridin onna same oil from 3 months ago
644 2018-04-09 22:49:11 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
645 2018-04-09 22:49:10 Alberta is gonna starve BC of oil and then the cars will run out of gas and we'll start walking and get really buff and then ride each other to work
646 2018-04-09 22:49:06 Olive oil > butter
647 2018-04-09 22:49:04 "We are really of the opinion that with the way the economy is in #WestVirginia, we really think that natural #oilandgas is going to present the real future for West Virginia," said Charlie Burd, executive director of the Independent Oil and Natural Gas Association.
648 2018-04-09 22:48:48 Those wigs are offensive to mankind. Just sits there like Tin Man when he didn’t have any oil.
649 2018-04-09 22:48:38 How to live healthy:

1. Drink 5L of apple cider vinegar a day
2. Rub coconut oil in your eyes
3. Wear kale underwear
4. Snort lines of quinoa each morning
5. Shower in green tea
6. Brush your teeth with turmeric
7. Avoid meat, dairy, water, air and people

650 2018-04-09 22:48:36 You're right about futuristic vision. Promises enticing early investors was building new books of business in oil, gas, space, commodities and medicine with technology fanning the flames. The rails and 3 ports didn't take long to coin it The Golden State.
651 2018-04-09 22:48:21 You need a new comeback to Trump’s issues.  The house isn’t on fire yet, but there’s matches, there’s oil, there’s rags.  At some point, EVEN YOU, will have to face reality.
652 2018-04-09 22:48:20 Yup, I like black castor oil and olive oil
653 2018-04-09 22:48:17 The #fossilfuel benefits are real—cheap transportation, cheap products from cheap energy. But oil is not the only way to provide cheap energy, just the one we know best. Technology will fill the #renewableenergy gap in a couple of decades, I bet.
654 2018-04-09 22:48:14 fr mess around and get it then they dont even change the oil lmao they playin dirty
655 2018-04-09 22:48:12 Please read just one book on investing in solar energy and the oil lobby. Just one.
656 2018-04-09 22:48:03 I really really really want to do a squirting&oil scene 
657 2018-04-09 22:48:02 So your argument is that we should place our coast at increased risk via oil-by-rail and unescorted tankers even though oil sands has very comparable emission profiles and provides economic benefits not seen by foreign imports?
658 2018-04-09 22:47:44 The one wey you give me abi, share oil money reach us na baba. Show us the way.
659 2018-04-09 22:47:40 Definitely just ordered a Creamsicle type essential oil for my diffuser
660 2018-04-09 22:47:09 My poor car was way overdue for an oil change.
661 2018-04-09 22:47:06 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

664 2018-04-09 22:46:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
665 2018-04-09 22:46:01 In any case, assuming that the brotherhood has some sort of leverage over European governments by means of oil, I would like to understand how exactly this plays out. The mere notion that most oil reserves are controlled by muslim countries, doesn’t quite suffice.
666 2018-04-09 22:45:49 My doctor asked me what vitamins & such I take regularly & was highly disappointed when I said acidophilus and CBD. 

She wanted me to say vitamins b,c,d & MCT oil. 
667 2018-04-09 22:45:37 If you want to die for an Israeli oil pipeline, go join ISIS.
668 2018-04-09 22:45:36 Remember I went through a stage of hating my stretch marks and I bought some bio oil but I’m such a lazy bitch I never opened the box so just decided I wouldn’t hate them instead
669 2018-04-09 22:45:31 @JustinTrudeau listening to Canadians that live on the west coast, who would be most affected by the environmental impacts of an oil or gas spill. An oil or gas spill would also be costly to the fishing industry which many Canadian communities depend on.
670 2018-04-09 22:45:11 who decided that seasame oil can be that strong

674 2018-04-09 22:44:38 So, I guess you support crooked legislators?  Look into their campaign funds and backers. There are reasons they protect oil and natural gas executives. The union is not to blame for anything. Easy target, but misguided.   Vote the crooks out!
675 2018-04-09 22:44:05 Oil, petrol, gas? 
676 2018-04-09 22:43:58 this sativa oil hella flames for my anxiety but the need for junk food and naps is fucking with me
677 2018-04-09 22:43:51 They pointed to Big Oil in the 2006 documentary "Who Killed the Electric Car?". Since electric cars found new life, Big Oil needs to offset those loses.
678 2018-04-09 22:43:41 Don't worry, poor people, America has plenty of money to fund wars for oil, that is what you really need, right?

683 2018-04-09 22:43:25 They will *want* to binge, but world #fossilfuel economics may well make doing so difficult. There's a lot of low-priced oil flowing around these days.

BC’s NDP Govt is now allowing Tankers of LNG along BC coast & Alaska sends Oil Tankers down the coast daily. 90’/, of Vanc oil, gas is fr Alberta by pipeline, it could stop?

Anything that involves gold (and oil) is...... very 1970s
687 2018-04-09 22:42:15 When one watches the Ed Henry interview, it becomes clear PRUITT is a snake oil salesman.
688 2018-04-09 22:42:09 This is a motorcycle oil cooler.
689 2018-04-09 22:42:06 Coconut oil is LIFE 
690 2018-04-09 22:42:06 Pls where is the massive infrastructure located? Is it in the oil sector, power, education, health, road or where exactly? I'm just curious
691 2018-04-09 22:41:58 Okay and I've mowed the lawn, changed the oil, and I've also scooped the driveway of snow. You can't put gender labels on the "chores" you do.
692 2018-04-09 22:41:57 All Canadians especially Albertans should read Mr Taft's book Oil's Deep State. We have been taken advantage of by elected governments that were run by Big Oil.
693 2018-04-09 22:41:44 Propaganda without logic. If Russia wanted war its had plenty of excuses to go to war. The only reason war hasnt escalated is cause they havent retaliated to attacks. This is all about oil, pipelines, and Western money. US military doesnt care about Syrians.
694 2018-04-09 22:41:33 Sure, expensive oil made a lot of expensive development proceed. Still didn’t get any oil to tide water as the original comment you commented on mentioned...
695 2018-04-09 22:41:26 Indeed, I have a large cloth with me, neem oil and have pre-requested a bucket. But now that I am in the airport none of this seems like a good idea, a) because it's freezing cold and b) because I just got my period.
696 2018-04-09 22:41:21 And quashing what bits of an economy we have left.
Colluding with mr. Buffet and his trainset to move oil....no pipeline required as long as that ilk is killing us off!
697 2018-04-09 22:41:15 I actually miss chilling at mine with all my friends in the sun covered in oil drinking and singing. Where is the sun
698 2018-04-09 22:41:13 So you would rather we NOT invest in assuring a viable oil and gas sector?

703 2018-04-09 22:40:50 Alberta: "damn ndp spending all of our money...."
Also Alberta: "we should totally throw our money at subsidizing the oil and gas industry"

#bcpoli #abpoli
704 2018-04-09 22:40:48 Yep and they get puppet regimes in the middle east, cheap controlled oil and start all over again to the next area to exploit
705 2018-04-09 22:40:18 What about the £Billions taken from North Sea as Unknown Region Oil as it does not come ashore in Scotland to be refined.
Google HMRC and Unknown Region North Sea Oil..

and there's nothing inherently wrong with not planning either
709 2018-04-09 22:39:49 Vitamin E skin oil works GREAT!
710 2018-04-09 22:39:42 Then City's oil money came into town and the man dipped, would've been battered if he kept on going until today lol
711 2018-04-09 22:39:20 The move exponentially 
No need for mirrors
You must work for big oil
712 2018-04-09 22:39:19 The more flavours you add the more correct your list is

· new(?) books 
· motor oil, straight from bottle 
· your friend's parent's glass patio table convos at 3am that were  weird but y'all keep trying to say it was like, pivotal 
· Motor oil, 3 months after last change 
· Pep!
713 2018-04-09 22:38:56 @KimCPosey Did I hear you correctly ? Dr. McKenzie is not the one making false claims, perhaps you  must be breathing to much of that Oil and Gas air!  Little documentary for you to watch called Toxic Homefront! Than report on inflammatory comments! #Colorado #
714 2018-04-09 22:38:56 Dum da dum dum,....sanctions!  Crisis acting to force oil interests.
715 2018-04-09 22:38:55 False. There’s enough alternative energy & innovation to go around. New industry sectors needed to keep our natural resources in Canada. Not sold to the highest bidder. Not even oil slaves want to work in oil. Reform education. immigrant slavery is not an option. #bcpoli #stopkm
716 2018-04-09 22:38:50 Coconut oil will help you get over it
717 2018-04-09 22:38:47 Cover signature with saran wrap taped on around to cover the signatuee. Spritz rest of jersey with a spray bottle of a mixture of rubbing alcohol with a few drop of teatree oil and another scent such as lavendar or lemon. Let air dry hanging. Lightly spray not drench.
718 2018-04-09 22:38:41 When a man is mad at me & ask why I did, it definitely only pours oil to fire that he is upset. After then he got more angry. It finally is that he just get angry
719 2018-04-09 22:38:36 Nah I wish but this mainly happened since my car got no oil through the system
720 2018-04-09 22:38:16 Maybe they can learn how to make some good Mexican food!  If you marinate a skirt steak in olive oil salt cilantro lime juice onions and garlic for 8 to  24 hours then they might do something useful!  Sorry you joined the National Guard to be used for politics!!!
721 2018-04-09 22:38:14 NEB rigged. Oil lobbyists wrote terms. Calgary bought BC election largely appointing Christy Clark. BC Liberals took foreign donations & Calgary funded campaign largely. Pipeline was re-routed on native land & through city & provincial parks. Etc. #IMHO #pnpcbc #bcpoli #cdnpoli
722 2018-04-09 22:38:11 Your oil dispenser has a look of Bernie Clifton. 
723 2018-04-09 22:38:03 I suggest a base of higher end extra virgin olive oil & red wine vinegar. From there add your own twist (mustard powder, poppy seeds, lemon juice etc) 
Hope that helps 
724 2018-04-09 22:37:44 Martin as far as i know it's more difficult to find a product that doesn't use it..
We have to live with palm oil because it's part of the food chain now BUT we do NOT have to keep destroying rainforests.
A balance has to be found between what we have and what we haven't
725 2018-04-09 22:37:34 found a chain, @snappysalads while in tx
they make their own creamy caesar dressing without soy oil.
chipotle-lime vinaigrette could use a bit more lime juice.
726 2018-04-09 22:37:29 Hot tempered? Maybe but at least he wears his heart on his sleeve. Kathleen Wynne has the ability to hypnotize much like a Cobra. Opportunistic? Doug doesn't need the money. To quote myself " the public would rather have the bombast rather than the snake oil.
727 2018-04-09 22:37:25 when u have Christian parents n one start having them death visions dream u know it's about to get real *get out blessing oil
728 2018-04-09 22:37:20 They might want to reconsider. After all. It is OIL MONEY that flows from Alberta to Quebec and BC. If Quebec and The Lower Mainland do not want oil going through, then they should give up 100% of any revenue that comes from it. Can’t have it both ways
729 2018-04-09 22:37:19 New camera.

My beard oil is delivered on a regular schedule by a guy who plays an accordion when I open the door. I don’t need email reminders for that.
730 2018-04-09 22:37:13 So, the nondoms with their fingers in the oil pie and trade route get their goodies and they hand back the UK to us, after having held it to ransom..?
731 2018-04-09 22:37:08 @chrislhayes is masturbating with patchouli oil ahead of tonight's show.
732 2018-04-09 22:36:54 It’s far from a dying horse in fact oil demand is on the rise, with new technologies, Oil is much cleaner now then what is was. Canada is a resource based country lots of our social programs are there because of oil revenue so you can’t have it both ways.
733 2018-04-09 22:36:53 Gee, who expected @NYGovCuomo & the IDC to be snake oil salesmen? #NoIDCNY
734 2018-04-09 22:36:53 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
735 2018-04-09 22:36:49 Anto drinking that oil like its H2O  #BBNaija

739 2018-04-09 22:36:25 Sorry. Nathan Pritikin of the @PritikinCenter already did that 1985 in the @NEJM   Clean on Plant no oil diet after failed stress test decades before.  Next.
740 2018-04-09 22:36:18 .@realDonaldTrump you use da bestest words  from your amazing mouth  remember if you want to drop a few pounds, olive oil. A quart a day. Buhleeve me #stormy #stormy #stormy #stormy #stormy
741 2018-04-09 22:36:13 Is that oil?? 
742 2018-04-09 22:35:56 Nope, there is literally a belief the “god” put the oil in the ground for us to exploit.
743 2018-04-09 22:35:53 So this boy put bra for head go bring groundnut oil
He is a monkey
744 2018-04-09 22:35:41 Coconut oil
745 2018-04-09 22:35:14 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
746 2018-04-09 22:34:59 Because they have no oil...
747 2018-04-09 22:34:58 Forgot my pachouli oil at home and I’m sad
748 2018-04-09 22:34:54 You know who's making real changes to our oil addiction? Bob Loblaw.
749 2018-04-09 22:34:38 Mid 1990's oil hit $8
750 2018-04-09 22:34:19 suspension of disbelief is being willing to accept "I don't know"
751 2018-04-09 22:34:17 Well gee, what business does someone with an ass the size of an oil tanker have telling anyone how to eat?
752 2018-04-09 22:34:12 imagine if oil was found on Antarctica lmaooo
753 2018-04-09 22:33:53 Done. This is horrible. The world has failed Syria. Those poor people caught in the crossfire of the barbarian who is slaughtering them and the thugs who want to control their oil.
754 2018-04-09 22:33:50 Which has more “good” fats - butter or coconut oil?
755 2018-04-09 22:33:47 Wash, rinse, repeat. Have you seen Florida lately?
756 2018-04-09 22:33:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
757 2018-04-09 22:33:27 Its ordinary eye kernel brings out oil
758 2018-04-09 22:33:23 Me and eeb like oil and water .. but then again we just alike 
759 2018-04-09 22:33:15 finally getting this oil change done 
760 2018-04-09 22:33:08 I love taking burning hot showers, getting out, rubbing olive oil crean through my hair and chillin in my towel for 2 hours  #finallyhomeee

765 2018-04-09 22:32:37 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.

767 2018-04-09 22:32:15 Oil and gas are only for the political elite, the rest of us can eat cake
768 2018-04-09 22:32:10 You’re wrong. Keystone was proposed in 05, approved in 07 and Phase 1 to Illinois was built in 2010. Phase 3 to Gulf of Mexico was built in 2014. To date it has safely delivered over 1 billion barrels of Alberta oil to the USA. Gulf of Mexico  is tidewater
769 2018-04-09 22:32:02 Oil change is a must too

771 2018-04-09 22:31:54 This new style of eating , is actually not bad.

Dinner no oil no fat and no dairy

glass rice noodle veggie spring rolls

Asian salad

Grilled Thai tempai
772 2018-04-09 22:31:43 We won’t sell It anywhere without pipelines but  for the cheapest price for oil! Check stock exchange oil prices for oil you’ll be surprised! And our dollar value will drop also and that will ruin also our buying power and the taxes that can spendJustin will drop too!
773 2018-04-09 22:31:39 I ask velly to pick up VEGETABLE oil.. then he calls me when he gets to the store to ask what kind of oil. I tell him again VEGETABLE oil .. he gets here with fucking sunflower oil................................... LIKE  
774 2018-04-09 22:31:38 Ferrari has definitely made a big step with its PU relative to Mercedes, and that is showing in quali. But oil burn (whoever was doing it in the past) isn’t such a big factor in races.
775 2018-04-09 22:31:09 Just who appointed the USA World Policeman? Russia has a naval base in #Syria & is protecting that asset. The USA has absolutely no history whatsoever in Syria, yet funds the rebels, has troops on the ground & has bombed Syrian Government's facilities. #Imperialism #Oil
776 2018-04-09 22:31:00 So I’ve basically been sat with this Olbas oil inhaler shoved up my nose all day and I just read that it shouldn’t be used more that four times an hour.... but technically I didnt take it out of my nose so that counts as one use.......right....
777 2018-04-09 22:30:58 Keni wait I need to get my vatika oil from Askol first 
778 2018-04-09 22:30:54 We’ve tried that for years. BC are the ones breaking federal law. There are consequences. What’s the point of being a country if we are going to stop the flow of products through our territory. BC managed to get the NDP this worked up. The same NDP who had members protesting oil
779 2018-04-09 22:30:47 No I’m just clumsy and I use oil in the shower so my tub is slippery
780 2018-04-09 22:30:46 Our take: The US wants to continue the chaos in the ME 1) US oil industry needs a higher oil price. 2) China is the biggest oil importer and for that reason, more chaos in the ME will be a problem for China 3) The Israeli-Jews do not want Asad to win: Iran-Iraq-Syria-Lebanon
781 2018-04-09 22:30:45 Horgan claims he's (merely) protecting #bcpoli enviro and regrettably it's true Fedgovt has under-invested on sea-based oil-spill-response capacity plus Feds negligent in failing to sign treaties w FNs affected enabling them to blackmail developers like @KM_Canada while PMJT AWOL
782 2018-04-09 22:30:43 Is this gonna be a grapes of wrath, dust bowl payment or will he make it up to any farmer who has oil, natural gas, coal or rare minerals on their farms?

786 2018-04-09 22:30:29 Think long about what would happen if China & Russia & Iran all agreed that the new market for gold was $5,000/oz, exchangeable at that rate in HK. Dubai, or SGEI for Chinese goods or Iranian or Russian oil.  Bye bye global USD shortage...  :)
787 2018-04-09 22:30:22 Is you who needs firing. There is no climate crisis, and it's not settled, by a long stretch. Its your snake oil salesman reputation that's having the crisis, that fewer & fewer people are believing and following you & your fake shrieking.
788 2018-04-09 22:30:10 Why would such a line ever be approved. Oil will scorch our earth over time as spills and natural cause disrupt these lines. SHANE ON ANY AND ALL WHO SUPPORTED IT AND SHAME ON THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT....DRILL and ship your oil from that point..no NEED for this
789 2018-04-09 22:30:05 It’s a conundrum for them. The good fortune of all that oil, yet so far inland. If I believed in god I’d think he/she had a sense of humour

796 2018-04-09 22:29:09 They use the same oil? I hope they use the bbq grease on the feet and not vice versa.
797 2018-04-09 22:28:53 Need you oil
798 2018-04-09 22:28:41 The eggs this morning were made with cannabis oil
799 2018-04-09 22:28:38 @AndrewScheer have you ever worked a day in the oil fields? Not even oil slaves wanna work in the oil sands. Time to reform education. if you can’t think of alternative ways of living, you might want to think about going back to school. #bcpoli #stopkm
800 2018-04-09 22:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

802 2018-04-09 22:28:12 Doug...
Doug..
Doug.
Check the polls buddy. 23%. 900,000 people. in a prov of 3.9M. Doesn't look like "BC" opposes the OIL (tar is a manmade synthetic) sands or pipelines. It looks like big city folks making a stand on a subject they really don't understand. Familiar?
803 2018-04-09 22:28:10 Mac has feet that smell like popcorn.   Toby usually doesn’t have problems.   The popcorn smell is yeast.   Virgin Coconut oil helps to a certain extent...applied to feet.   Let them lick it a little or give them a 1/4 teaspoon to eat.   But we typically use vet wipes.
804 2018-04-09 22:27:49 I got so lucky! They had the coconut oil at the dollar store. Have all my ingredients and will make the brew in a little bit. Resting and soup first. 
805 2018-04-09 22:27:49 Exactly!
806 2018-04-09 22:27:48 His people have been killed for oil and gas. wake up sweety. Syrians love Assad.
807 2018-04-09 22:27:46 Fuck I think I stepped in oil
808 2018-04-09 22:27:21 Ever since I started using Jamaican castor oil, peppermint oil, and tea trea oil together my hair has been growing like crazy and my curl pattern is changing!!
809 2018-04-09 22:27:16 so. about the price of a 488 oil change
810 2018-04-09 22:27:01 I have read bits of research on things that might be beneficial (eg tree nuts, which luckily I’d started eating anyway!) and after seeing your thread about CBD oil I was actually thinking about writing a blog post on the topic of food/supplements etc...
811 2018-04-09 22:26:56 I have been advocating for a Midnight Oil reunion show for years. If he gets elected say goodbye to that dream. Oh, and he’s a horrible garbage human. I’ve decided to go w/the “garbage human” reason.
812 2018-04-09 22:26:55 @CalilyTm loved your anti-fungal tea tree oil body wash. Wish I could get some more.
813 2018-04-09 22:26:48 Ahaha. I still do oil, acrylic and watercolour demonstrations and workshops for Winsor & newton but I demonstrate for Pebeo on their mixed media range too
814 2018-04-09 22:26:40 about 97% of scientists have the data to back up my statement. suggest you stop reading the 3% who are on the payroll of the oil folks. although, even the oil folks admit climate change is real. nice try though.
815 2018-04-09 22:26:21 If you have coconut oil it works really well but let it soak into them for a while to soften them up x
816 2018-04-09 22:26:21 I'm very excited to get back to BC and be drafted on the battlefield into the inevitable oil war between British Columbia and Alberta.
817 2018-04-09 22:26:20 Holy shit!!! I’m officially psychotic and so embarrassed.. I just realized I have a stress relief candle, a stress relief oil diffuser, a stress relief wall scent AND stress relief hand soap... Wtf is wrong with me?!?!
818 2018-04-09 22:26:10 Somali government is weak and how the fuck they can’t shut down UAE embassy in Mogadishu because the money was going to support al shabab and I don’t understand why Somalis like garbage Araba who we use to support and feed when the didn’t had the oil
819 2018-04-09 22:26:05 Snake Oil Salesman!!!
820 2018-04-09 22:26:02 here is the solution. forget the pipeline and refine the oil in Alberta or somewhere else in Canada. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
821 2018-04-09 22:25:59 its all about oil (fat), sugar and salt.
822 2018-04-09 22:25:55 I mixed my trophy wife with baby oil & it gives such a peng glow but now the shimmer doesn’t wanna come off 
823 2018-04-09 22:25:55 أفخم ملكي
824 2018-04-09 22:25:43 the “one day” thing is absurd, but even if you walk it back + project over the next 12 months, there’s so many factors that go into that calculation. plus, what if price of oil spikes or china starts buying more stuff from russia? what if oil plummets and china buys less stuff?
825 2018-04-09 22:25:24 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
826 2018-04-09 22:25:01 #pnpcbc here we go!! Ndp using the, we need to refine oil products...
Then we'll need a pipeline for each product, pretty hard to do, when one pipeline is too many
827 2018-04-09 22:24:53 .@CDPHE Chief Medical Officer & Executive Dir. Dr. Larry Wolk says of new McKenzie study "5. A detailed risk assessment is currently being conducted using more comprehensive data collected by CSU researchers on substances directly emitted from oil and gas operations..." (1/2)
828 2018-04-09 22:24:51 My mom just made me lick some oil off my hand “to make me feel better” which I don’t even think is safe ..
829 2018-04-09 22:24:49 I'm not familiar with this one, but it looks yummy!  Google UC Davis olive oil study and there are some there.  But personally I only ever use @VillaCappelli
830 2018-04-09 22:24:42 Yes, but these oil reserves are not necessarily controlled by the muslim brotherhood and neither are all (or most) muslims represented by them. They probably have the strongest ties with the Qatari’s, who are currently at odds with the Arab Liga for their Iranian ties.
831 2018-04-09 22:24:34 #Crazy “journalism” absolute rubbish article. I’d like to know what big picture is... Rothschild? oil? What’s causing us to create a motive towards a 3rd world war. So called Chem attack in Uk = point at Russia, Syrian attack when Assad had no need, blame Assad + Russia. 2+2=....
832 2018-04-09 22:24:31 Hindi biro mag golden brown ang pancake ng walang butter oil.
833 2018-04-09 22:24:18 Most of the country was believing the snake oil salesman.
834 2018-04-09 22:24:16 I’ve so many, but I just love old oil lanterns and vintage-y taper candle holders. Now if the time and money to dig through dusty antique sales just lined up with my love, I’d be all set.  I was fascinated you the descriptions of watch and clock making in Goudge’s Deans Watch
835 2018-04-09 22:24:10 Does anyone know of a place locally that I could buy geranium essential oil?
836 2018-04-09 22:24:08 Snake oil
837 2018-04-09 22:23:53 Everytime someone tells me I'm not funny,it keeps me doing stand up..like I appreciate support but what I really need is someone constantly telling me I'm fucking trash..it's the oil in the engine of this stupid dream of mine.
838 2018-04-09 22:23:52 Been back but I time myself in the shower I have to pay for everything water n oil to heat up the water so I get in n out as quickly as possible
839 2018-04-09 22:23:50 I think technology will be disruptive with AI playing crucial role.higher changes that tech will be misused leading to the redefinition of borders,internet,work,finance...cyber war is inevitable. Oil/minerals...won't be most valuable assets anymore leaving the place to data,AI..
840 2018-04-09 22:23:49 Having worked around the world in the oil patch, Alberta has nothing to apologize for other then losing the PR war and being easy to attack.

843 2018-04-09 22:23:38 Oh here we go, the oil industry's talking heads gonna tell us how it's going to be. Right, weren't you guys cheerleading for MacBloe during the Clayoquot stand off too?
844 2018-04-09 22:23:26 They are doing so, thru gold & oil.  PBOC advisors began talking about this back in mid-2015.
845 2018-04-09 22:23:15 Worth much more than crude oil.
846 2018-04-09 22:23:12 @OchsnerHealth wonder how many illnesses could have been treated for the same cost as the self playing piano in the metairie branch? How many for the same cost as all those oil paintings?

856 2018-04-09 22:21:53 I looked really cute for work tonight and no one has told me I look cute yet so you could say this is an emergency natural disaster oil spill disaster
857 2018-04-09 22:21:51 Did you see I called out that oil spill 3 days in advance before it hit news when I give prophecy it happens fast
858 2018-04-09 22:21:50 I needed a oil change , get my tire pressure checked and go get some house necessities

860 2018-04-09 22:21:45 The Holy Ointment recipe looks hella shady in the NKJV.  We prefer the common sense approach to Exodus chapter 30, verses 22-25 -->  6 kg of pure myrrh, 3 kg of cinnamon, 3 kg of "Kaneh bosm," 6 kg of cassia, mixed with 4.73 liters of olive oil.
861 2018-04-09 22:21:43 Oil could go as low as $10

This report underscores the potential public health importance of the 500-foot setback and the need to collect more comprehensive air quality data in communities in close proximity to oil and gas operations."

864 2018-04-09 22:21:29 My mom has started using CBD oil for general pains, she thinks it may have helped somewhat with the neuropathic but back pain seems to be quite bad at present. But she's also using other pain meds. What strength is this?
865 2018-04-09 22:21:28 Maybe if we start a rumor the war in Syria is all about "Halliburton"'and a pipeline, they'll be back out on the bridges with" No blood for oil" signs ... and Pelosi and Kerry will again be phoning Assad for dinner dates.

868 2018-04-09 22:21:20 It’s hard to explain to people that part of what I love about the franchise is it’s 55 years of a mom-and-pop business bringing their weird fixations to a blockbuster series. 

THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH happened because Barbara watched a cnn report about competing oil pipelines.
869 2018-04-09 22:21:19 Agreed. I think what’s happening is sea change in public opinion re: #oil #pipelines

881 2018-04-09 22:20:29 at night for cleansing I use erborian solid cleansing oil followed by neogen’s real fresh green tea cleansing stick. from there on out, cosrx (blackhead power liquid and whitehead power liquid, snail mucin, and vitamin c serum when I don’t use the bha/ahas)
882 2018-04-09 22:20:23 The world cannot change or survive the next 50 years with out oil and by products. Do ur and reduce ur consumption by 30! I bet u cannot! Can’t tweet with out oil, cannot eat pineapple, ride a bike or drive a car

884 2018-04-09 22:20:11 That is because you appear unaware of the difference in grades of crude and the uses of each grade. Bituminous oil is not "crap" and actually produces more refined fuel per barrel than the light crude people appear to love so much

Ever.
897 2018-04-09 22:18:33 “Audio grade” caps try to optimize for a flatter ESR over frequency curve, though no manufacturer I’ve ever seen actually publishes that curve. So, whether they’re pushing snake oil or not, I can’t tell. But it is a real thing and can be measured.
898 2018-04-09 22:18:33 Theyre all after Russias oil and gas. Theyve none left and they will kill happily for it, without any mandate from voters.
899 2018-04-09 22:18:25 @cenkuygur Just heard you say Trump approved pipelines. No, it was OBAMA. Who also repealed the 40-year ban on exporting oil! And then eminent domain was used ILLEGALLY, since the pipelines profit the FEW and are not for the good of all.

903 2018-04-09 22:17:47 Not a "higher" price, Doug. They want the "same" price everyone else in the world gets. Even the ones that export millions of barrels into eastern Canada.
So its ok to run your cars on Saudi oil but not AB oil at half the price.
Things that make you go, "hmmm".

912 2018-04-09 22:16:40 #tytlive The pipelines leaking are still a win for the oil & gas companies as these corporations own the companies that supposedly clean up any spills

923 2018-04-09 22:15:21 Here's a little something for the oil fans to think on...

The price of oil going up is what birthed the oil sands. The prices did that, because the market was kept in check, in part by OPEC and in part by environmental concerns. Every once and a while, OPEC likes to make the
924 2018-04-09 22:15:10 He’s waiting for Kinder Morgan to walk away and the blame oil prices like he did with energy east.
925 2018-04-09 22:14:51 How would moving to alternative energies and reducing the oil needed in this country cause that?

931 2018-04-09 22:14:18 Why is does this photo look like an oil painting?
932 2018-04-09 22:13:33 Yes, finally Alberta has a government that followed up on their promise to diversify...not like the last 8 PC governments who promised to diversify after the 1982 drop in oil prices..but just couldn't see beyond oil.

We, as mankind, have so much knowledge, so much information, so much history... but still this world seems to be on fire and people try to extinguish this fire with oil and wonder why it gets worse

946 2018-04-09 22:11:55 People don’t become friends with you on social media so you can solicit whatever snake oil you’re selling that’s not a real job to them.
947 2018-04-09 22:11:45 The only thing stopping the Kinder Morgan pipeline is the lack of consent from the communities involved, the consent that Trudeau himself said must be there. Also the product is not oil, it's bitumen, the most offensive of substances.
948 2018-04-09 22:11:20 What do you expect from ethically challenged politicians from coal and oil states, that get major contributions from oil and coal companies. Rand Paul is from Kentucky and the drinking water is tainted and smells like diesel in some parts. Sounds like a job for the EPA.

978 2018-04-09 22:07:50 Here's what pipeline proponents can't seem to grasp.  Pipeline expansions are built for future growth.  There is lots of capacity in place today.  Time to stop building new oil infrastructure and focus on clean energy.

3 bunches collards: wash, remove stems, & chop
*add that shit to the pot & stir, then add some broth &

990 2018-04-09 22:05:42 I hate the smell of Cocnut Oil, but the wonders it does to my hair make it worth it.. 
991 2018-04-09 22:05:41 Sadly, they are still dying till tomorrow of oil population in Africa, racism in the US and many other vices perpetrated against blacks all over the globe. Shamelessly,in Africa,the black are aiding the killing of their brothers and sisters and children
992 2018-04-09 22:05:29 Even petrostates and oil and gas companies are moving towards diversification. There's a strong economic argument that we must do the same, or risk serious consequences. We think (hope) that more Canadians are starting to understand this.
993 2018-04-09 22:05:09 Holy Motiva Batman!!!  Chief Executive Brian Coffman, of Motiva, said Saturday that the company is considering increasing the crude oil capacity of the Port Arthur refinery from 603,000 barrels-per-day to up to 1.5 million bpd, which would make it the world's largest.

1000 2018-04-09 22:04:15 I am sure praying was heavily relied upon as a game plan to bring back sky high oil prices! Oh lord...I promise that if you bring back the money made from insanely high oil prices that this time we won't screw things up! We'll save and invest in infrastructure, we promise! #ableg

1005 2018-04-09 22:03:50 They are not ‘no more’. They are canon. Episode 7 and 8 are just delusions of Threepio’s while he takes an oil bath. Entertaining but wrong. You wait. First scene of episode 9 is him being rebooted by Cakhmaim. I absolutely guarantee it.
1006 2018-04-09 22:03:32 Ohh really but I find her views very absurd. The crisis in Syria has nothing to do with Assad, Sunni Vs shiaa. It's about oil, gas, resources and finally the NWO!

1019 2018-04-09 22:02:34 Trump might pull us from Syria and oil is still only ~$68. How is this not a massive buy?

1021 2018-04-09 22:02:07 Chaos in the ME is in the interest of the US. 1) It will increase the price of oil, US shale needs a higher oil price 2) it serves the Jewish-Israeli interest 3) it will harm China that now imports more oil than the US. We are pretty accurate with our projections.
1022 2018-04-09 22:01:56 I hear you. I'm arguing that for many Notley's pipeline promoting and oil sands cheerleading doesn't come across like a "substantive address of climate issues." And it certainly doesn't address the FN rights and spill risks that motivate many here.

1032 2018-04-09 22:00:57 Squeaks, squeals and metal-to-metal grinding noises are typical signs you’re past due for new brake pads or rotors. If it’s been more than two years since your brake parts were replaced, it’s a good idea to have the brakes checked at every oil change or every six months.

1054 2018-04-09 21:58:29 So I am debating on whether to get the fenty beauty body oil. If I do it, I have to buy a whole new wardrobe (which is already true because summer clothes for me are just the ones I wear all year minus the sweaters.) UGH but I want to glow like a lighting bug

Nobody likes them. Nobody wants to be like them. They produce nothing (oil just happens to be there.) Makes no sense.
1065 2018-04-09 21:56:51 Sorry, but everyone who voted for Trump deserves everything they get.  He’s like the old snake oil salesmen, you buy, you get robbed.

1084 2018-04-09 21:54:32 @MargaretWente Canada is stuck in backward energy policy. Foreign oil Corps pay low royalty rates and we send raw product to foreign refineries and buy it back at higher prices. The same as B.C. shipping raw logs to Asia. We could work together to fix that instead of infighting

1087 2018-04-09 21:54:16 Since the cost of refining bitumen will remain higher than the price of oil for the foreseeable future, Kinder Morgan has been building a pipeline to nowhere that has provided a pretext for multinational fossil fuel companies to unload their stranded Canadian assets on Canadians.

1095 2018-04-09 21:53:21 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
1096 2018-04-09 21:53:19 There is a tremendous global market for crude oil of a WTI equivalent. More than dilbit by both value and volume. 
Refineries and upgraders do cost billions of dollars, and so what? Capital is avilable to these companies. Hey! Maybe they can raise it from the Rocef's & Buffet!
1097 2018-04-09 21:53:16 She needs to be fired or asked to step down. Really!? How dare she begin an oil war in Canada when Canadians in BC are standing up to protecting the environment...that is NOT a CRIME. It's our Constitutional Right as Canadians to FREEDOM of SPEECH! 
1098 2018-04-09 21:52:58 Refinery plants, aren't cheap. Alberta's oil is low grade. As-a-result, it has limited uses. Also, there's the less international import/export restrictions on the unrefined/raw product.
1099 2018-04-09 21:52:46 Sadly I'm not a Sam. Or a Chris, Dan or Josh. So I suck, right?
1100 2018-04-09 21:52:44 I will not be swayed by fear mongering.The reality is the only winners in these projects are the oil companies. We have one of the lowest tax rates for big oil in the world. It's embarrassing. We are losing BILLIONS in tax revenues. We should be moving forward, not backwards.
1101 2018-04-09 21:52:34 Fracking leads to earthquakes due to the change in density underground when the oil is replaced. How many more earthquakes do you need before you stop?

1102 2018-04-09 21:52:18 No. The lemmings who are stupid enough to buy into their propaganda and fight against our own nation are doing it for free. But I'm sure oil execs around the world in boardrooms are cheering on those who are getting arrested for them.
1103 2018-04-09 21:52:09 I advocated that Canada, provinces, & business should combine to build a #refinery in Alberta so that the oil shipped to Burrard Inlet is not #bitumen, but refined oil - although number of tankers would increase, the cargo would be less damaging and easier to clean if spilled
1104 2018-04-09 21:52:03 EU makes life harder.
Today at Tuscan vineyard we learned the ancient practice of proving olive oil in ceramic urns must end as EU directive insists steel barrels must be used,

Can't trust the people....
1105 2018-04-09 21:51:58 A pipeline over land is one thing. A pipeline to the BC coast and increased oil tanker traffic is quite another!! Keep pipeline away from OUR beautiful BC waters which are a national treasure! GOD SAVE THE WHALES TOO!!
1106 2018-04-09 21:51:50 @PnPCBC Time to go back to the drawing board. The whole process was suspect. Alberta must answer BC concerns about oil spills

1121 2018-04-09 21:49:47 Canada’s oil has to be sold at a discount below WTI and Brent Crude. Also, comparatively, Alberta's oil is pretty crappy and has limited uses.

1130 2018-04-09 21:49:02 We will not give up until the real dangers facing our country are dealt with. 1) sensible gun laws. 2) rising sea levels 3) the right to practice my beliefs 3) the freedom of the FREE press. You're selling great snake oil. #GrifterDonny
1131 2018-04-09 21:48:36 Coincidently there’s a major oil pipeline running through that country.

1138 2018-04-09 21:47:30 Oh yeah! Oil itself does the jobs its set out to do, but like just has something to base your economy on, not so much.
1139 2018-04-09 21:47:15 The #Oklahoma wind industry pays 2x more taxes than oil and gas. Do not over-tax clean #renewables to make up for tax breaks to oil and gas. Lawmakers should incentivize, not punish, clean energy. Vote NO on HB3710 & 1035xx. #okleg #oklaedwalkout @MBlancett @SenStanislawski
1140 2018-04-09 21:47:10 I’ll never open up cause I know people change like the oil
1141 2018-04-09 21:47:00 The US should get the hell out of there. Have you no shame, telling a Syrian that your country is illegally in Syria to prevent Russia exporting oil while Syrian people get killed. You imperialist, I hope you will be around to see the US empire collapse, hopefully very soon.
1142 2018-04-09 21:46:58 We are all being raped at the gas pumps: no good reason: oil is only 63 dollars per barrel: Trudeau’s and Gerald Butts plan in full motion. Wake up people. #justintrudeau
1143 2018-04-09 21:46:56 This is my shocked face. Got to love that Saudi Arabian oil $$$. Bought the Reigns victory from Mania. Wonder how much a Rousey title win will cost? @davemeltzerWON
1144 2018-04-09 21:46:52 Yes, was of a similar mind to you but have been assured what we do is hike our currency to whatever it is related to the oil, so if at the time it’s high on sterling, we go there, but we can hike it to the dollar too, but retain our choice of currency.
1145 2018-04-09 21:46:51 Why do my biggest bills fall in the same week every month? Why are there so many birthdays so close together for me? Why do i need an oil change already? Why am i poor?
1146 2018-04-09 21:46:50 It’s never fun changing oil on your car when you take the oil filter and the seal stays on the car.
1147 2018-04-09 21:46:48 Grilling makes all food carcinogenic and ingesting damaged fats is never good. The same would occur if one were to grill or overcook vegetables in olive oil.

1153 2018-04-09 21:46:15 So if pipeline built to an acceptable level of safety would you be okay with it? What do you say to people of Alberta where their livelihood depends on oil and gas sector?

1158 2018-04-09 21:45:36 Benefit Agreement/Revenue Sharing is a legally binding contract signed between the nation and the corporation involved with the activity (be it mining, fishing, oil or gas) and is therefore 100% made with consent (like all other legal contracts)
To state otherwise is just false.

1163 2018-04-09 21:45:04 Ok thats what I thought you mean't. Relying on one industry is silly as fuck, but I was like "idk the products that oil itself produces seem pretty consistent and reliable."

1168 2018-04-09 21:44:28 Accidents happen and hard working men and women will clean it up. Just like during oil spills from tankers on the ocean. Who will not be cleaning it up are people like you Bernie that have never had a real job and have mooched off government your entire life.
1169 2018-04-09 21:44:15 At least she fired the gun. I had a friend over from Australia... I finally got her to pick it up, but she refused to fire it. And it was chambered in .22. At the plinking range. Some women are not cut out for guns. Yet. They haven't had that life experience that hardens them...

1175 2018-04-09 21:43:32 further I suppose @andrewscheer takes full responsibility for the drop in oil prices that occurred under Harper's tenure  cuz he didn't control OPEC outputand which caused hardship and job losses in Canada's oil industry  right

You come up with these blasphemous heresies on your own?
1191 2018-04-09 21:41:44 Do not back down on this. They've invented a deadline and they're making it an ultimatum. We can't let an oil company from Texas tell us what to do.

1206 2018-04-09 21:41:04 The economy of it is too up and down. We shouldn't (can't) rely on it has a main source of income because when its down it destroys other industries and affects those not even involved in oil. If we put our eggs in other baskets, instead of one, I just feel it would be better...

1210 2018-04-09 21:40:32 The Kinder Morgan pipeline will become the "hill to die on", and the only way to weaken the power big oil has on our governments. The Feds will either listen to the voters, or the oil industry, their choice.

1220 2018-04-09 21:39:34 Dear Andy, do you feel just a tad hypocritical posting this? 10 years in office, height of the oil boom, not one pipeline to tidal waters. No refinery built in Alberta. Face it the PC Party failed Alberta at every level.
1221 2018-04-09 21:39:27 I ended up loosing the will to live and lathered my eyes in coconut oil and pulled them out hahaxx
1222 2018-04-09 21:39:18 Alberta thinks they can bully BC. We will remember this when oil collapses and Alberta is a welfare state
1223 2018-04-09 21:38:53 Read an article this a.m. saying softwood is having a tough time getting to market because of rail. "Output from the BC Interior remains depressed due to shipping constraints (down 18%). Rail routes affected by cold weather and unexpected volume. Could that volume be oil by rail?

1234 2018-04-09 21:37:39 I don't just want to stop the pipelines. I want to get off of fossil fuels completely. Use hemp oil and other alternatives for manufacturing. Solar & wind for electricity generation. Electric vehicles, and any other possibilities. You want to keep things as is.
1235 2018-04-09 21:37:24 Is it wrong or selfish of me to charge my sister gas money for always borrowing my car? I normally wouldn’t but I’ve had to get my tags, my breaks, and my oil changed. I can barely afford to get groceries and I make less than $200 every week
1236 2018-04-09 21:37:23 I miss Mike’s charred string beans, but today I get to do my own except on some heat with little oil

1241 2018-04-09 21:36:31 USA's debt itself is equal to GDP of 10 Indias. That's the level of finance disparity we are talking about. And such empty dollar was given value by oil dirty money. Petrodollar.
1242 2018-04-09 21:36:29 @JustinTrudeau how about we worry about pipelines for clean water on the reserves instead of forcing another oil pipeline through to poison their land #WaterIsLife

1245 2018-04-09 21:36:15 I get it....it is all about the oil $$ the Saudi's are paying, and the need to do good business.  That being said, it is a bad look that this event is not only getting the WM treatment, but also the Royal Rumble...just without women.

1247 2018-04-09 21:35:59 Hundreds of dollars later, my bills for the month are paid, got a new car battery and oil changed.
1248 2018-04-09 21:35:44 Chinese buy $100B oil from US and sells 100B to Rest of World. Net zero.

US sells 100B more to China and RoW buys 100B less from US (or exports more to it)
Net zero.

Everyone has same total deficit, but now with different countries.

Bilateral deficits are mostly a distraction.

#IAmNewIndia
1255 2018-04-09 21:34:47 Not surprising to find out that Saudi Arabia produces the most oil daily in the world. They produce 11.75 million barrels per day, thats 3 times as much as Canada, and represents it 13.24% of all oil produced daily in the world. #Lesson5 #OilSands #Petroleum

It's sad to see infowars going down.

1266 2018-04-09 21:33:01 When the pipeline bursts or springs a leak & it's almost a certainty, will the rule of law apply to the oil company too? Or just a slap on the wrist for polluting our environment?

1268 2018-04-09 21:32:57 I hate those  my grandparents gave me the oil every morning before school.
1269 2018-04-09 21:32:50 @ValentineShow Saudi’s oil company Aramko is going public. They want price of oil up to 70 to increase the IPO valuation.
1270 2018-04-09 21:32:42 I got smell of fuel/oil giving me a headache new injectors leaking I think! I’ve had windscreen wipers come loose before and go all spastic on me before 
1271 2018-04-09 21:32:40 Same. When going LC, I used to have mayonnaise but have now completely dropped it. Fat sources are now clarified butter (make my own), butter, olive and coconut oil, duck and goose fat, lard.And when I say lard,I mean I fry bacon first then fry whatever comes next in rendered fat
1272 2018-04-09 21:32:37 I thought I was losing my eyesight when I got tea tree oil in it the other night 
1273 2018-04-09 21:32:35 I just Googled and found out soybean oil was the highest concentration of omega-6 oils on the market, so not draining sardines is basically negating the omega-3 benefits. Hell, let them sit on some paper towel for a while.
1274 2018-04-09 21:32:35 I came on strong? Wouldn't you? You are selling my children short to protect yours. You know I was once narrow minded towards oil, and still hate our dependence. I also know oil is at least a 30 year market, whether we try to choke it or not. Oil pays for green initiatives.
1275 2018-04-09 21:32:16 I know from experience that usually the next scenario is either the car not starting at all or the car starts spitting oil
1276 2018-04-09 21:32:03 Well we shall see I might throw some fish oil gels for the benefits of it
1277 2018-04-09 21:31:46 You have yet to make a case that this pipeline is in the 'national interest'. You have yet to provide evidence that the pipeline is safe for BC, or how the world can meet its Paris goals with it. To this point this pipeline is in the interest of a foreign oil company not Canada.
1278 2018-04-09 21:31:13 I get real fancy with the head and shoulders with eucalyptus. And I get separate argan oil shampoo and conditioner since using dandruff shampoo every day is hard on my hair

1292 2018-04-09 21:29:39 Despite the vast quantities of oil reserves in Canada, most of it is found in tar sands. Sadly, we lack the technology and the money needed to refine the oil so we export 71% of it to the US and then buy back the refined products such as gasoline, etc. #Lesson5 #TarSands #Oil
1293 2018-04-09 21:29:20 So everybody chose to get their Oil changed today wow
1294 2018-04-09 21:29:12 so i think i'm addicted to mystery coffins from @vampfangs now. they sent me a body oil that's called funeral parlor and i'm in love. eternally in love.

1297 2018-04-09 21:29:01 Exactly the truth. These people would kill everyone on planet earth to get the oil and put it in Israel's ass
1298 2018-04-09 21:28:43 The U.S. interest is the same INTEREST they habve when they interfered with LYBIA and occupied Iraq. Now, Syria. You want to know what all of them have in common:

2. Oil..... Oil.... Oil....

Slanders companies with no evidence, just because he disagrees with oil.
1302 2018-04-09 21:28:09 If Syria had massive Oil reserves, the Yanks would've invaded by now...
1303 2018-04-09 21:28:08 And to selling snake oil.
1304 2018-04-09 21:28:05 As Oil rises to $68.65, the Jamboree for 2019 will soon commence
1305 2018-04-09 21:27:58 It's time to admit something. There are no good guys in Syria. Neither side is worth our time or blood or cash. However, if we are going to use any force, demolish the damn place & take the oil. We could even split it with Putin. Oh, that would be "collusion"........
1306 2018-04-09 21:27:54 We don't stop building cars because of car crashes.
When are we supposed to run out of oil?
There are 7 billion people living on Earth. WHEN will #climatechange wipe us all out?
Electric cars aren't feasible yet. Oil is needed for things other than cars: plastics, etc
1307 2018-04-09 21:27:50 Just finished recording a #FuturesRadio show with @anasalhajji & @chigrl about Trading Using Fundamentals & Technicals in Oil Markets!  Comes out a week from today!!! @chigrl cat also makes an appearance LOL
1308 2018-04-09 21:27:46 Quick maths......increased oil price and bond issuance
1309 2018-04-09 21:27:28 What?  Russia and Iran stopped the War that Obama and the Deep State wanted to commit and they also helped Assad fight the US Deep State backed terrorists known as ISIS, al Nusra et al who INVADED Syria.  Syria can do whatever Oil deals they want with whoever they want.
1310 2018-04-09 21:27:25 I’m ridiculously self conscious whilst getting my oil changed. Like I’m at the doctors. When they’re inspecting I’m wondering, “can they tell that the only maintenance I do is gas and this long overdue oil change??” That’s right. I consider putting gas into my car “maintenance.”
1311 2018-04-09 21:27:22 Deep state wants US to attack Syria and Trump is walking into the trap. It will cost US heavy. Russia obviously would like to see oil up
1312 2018-04-09 21:27:22 I feel ZERO pity that they bought his snake oil. If I,and the rest of the world, have to suffer under this administration it seems fair that they do too.
1313 2018-04-09 21:27:15 My coconut oil stayed liquid all winter and we had the coldest winter ever. It's the twilight zone over here.

1315 2018-04-09 21:27:05 So if no pipeline is built, you do realize more oil will move by rail which is proven more accident prone then pipelines. How many more jobs will that cost? Oh wait....you don't see that because it's outside your train of thought.
1316 2018-04-09 21:27:03 Will you get butt naked and oil yourself around me
1317 2018-04-09 21:26:41 Nobody objected when US oil companies (and SunCor) popped the cork on  the new Hebron oil field off the east coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Yup, loads of offshore drilling, oil tankers, and plans for more out east.  Where are the Green party on that file? Crapping on AB it seems.

Lets say it wasn't Israel supported rebels but it was Assad, he used a WMD, we invade them, Israel and neo-cons take over all their minerals/oil fields, we steal artifacts, hang Assad then we learn it wasn't them and they didn't have WMDs. Sounds like a plan

1345 2018-04-09 21:23:40 Yes, we use oil for other purposes than for fuel, but that can change too as plastics are becoming a serious problem as well. Biodegradable plastics and pharmaceuticals can be made from biological sources.

1382 2018-04-09 21:19:43 Literally half my paycheck went to an oil change 
1383 2018-04-09 21:19:31 Only issue with the old M120 V12 is the common oil leak between the heads which necessitates the heads to have to be removed to get to it! Would rather have the almost unbreakable M113 in Supercharged form in one....that would be some car!
1384 2018-04-09 21:19:28 Just found out there are no truffles in truffle oil. Whatever next? No crab in crabsticks? #QI
1385 2018-04-09 21:19:21 The public must pay for their complete mishandling of the oil sands portfolio. $100/barrel and they still messed up.
1386 2018-04-09 21:19:19 Yes those poor little Green Climaphobes are so destitute compare to those Evil oil companies.

1390 2018-04-09 21:19:03 Unfortunately lumber is not something I would short imho...  Fundamentals are too strong, even with subdued housing starts... Probable it will continue to rally over the midterm until the us economy rolls over.  Cut your losses, short oil...

1394 2018-04-09 21:18:46 Its called alcohol.  It works and it can be produced within our own country.  Its a very easy transfer from oil.  Get it done Bernie its not that hard for someone like yourself.
1395 2018-04-09 21:18:33 Don’t think I’ve ever not wanted to go back to work as much  Had fab week off just being, & being active. Slumped today. Luckily only 3 day week.
Unluckily no heating and hot water due to oil tank replacement except a small oil filled radiator and a kettle.

1402 2018-04-09 21:17:37 That's not a simple question, idiot. How could he give a firm answer without nationalizing the oil industry?
1403 2018-04-09 21:17:37 iirc they're heading for a oil tanker first and manage to turn around with backup controls to just scrape the side of it but they turned to face the town. btw the tanker ends up blowing up anyway
1404 2018-04-09 21:17:32 BC cannot have it both ways if Alberta curtails oil or even gasoline shipments to BC and the price of gas sky rockets to like 5.00 a liter sure heads will roll in Victoria and granola eaters will be eating crow.@jjhorgan @GlobalBC

1411 2018-04-09 21:16:59 It was the US oil industry, and the government was plenty complicit with what they did in that regard. I'm saying this as a person from the US, btw. Not trying to talk down Europe's role in this, just not undersell the US's.

1417 2018-04-09 21:16:18 Thats right 
Why they don't attack Al assad ? they do it fast in Iraq ! ( they don't have any right to do this )
Because there is no money no oil no gold they don't care whats happen to any country they care about $$$$
1418 2018-04-09 21:16:10 Time for #farms to send their grain thru northern Manitoba so BC grain handlers tell their premier to rethink pipelines. #ag #oil #gas

1421 2018-04-09 21:15:45 That thick lasting intensely penetrating smell that covers everything that crosses the threshold at daycare? = Essential oil diffuser, took me three weeks to figure out ...and now it’s growing on me
1422 2018-04-09 21:15:40 My aesthetic: nude, fresh out of the shower and lathered in oil, breaking fast at 3 pm with 3 perfectly ripe mangoes, juice dripping down my hands
1423 2018-04-09 21:15:36 Watched a few reviews on the Body Lava and I think I’m guna go for the Sol De Janeiro Glow Oil instead
1424 2018-04-09 21:15:34 haven't been there but worked in the oil field for years.i know the routine.haven't heard about any more leaks from there,have you?somebody would have reported it if it happened again.problem fixed.

1426 2018-04-09 21:15:23 No it  does not! Maybe u should get rid of, windmills, solar panels, your computer, cell phone, stop wearing clothes, lipstick, chapstick, liquid containers, television, pots pans, anything plastic! There r @ least 6000 things made from one 42 gal barrel of oil! Good try
1427 2018-04-09 21:15:21 Not when you understand that the goal is to discredit President Trump, Remove President Trump and send a message to any non-establishment types who dare run for office again. Then it makes perfect sense.
1428 2018-04-09 21:15:14 Without protecting the Saudis and Kuwaitis from Iraqi invaders, we would not have had access to most of the oil we had at the time. That national interest would've greatly impacted your freedoms on several levels, primarily economic. #ingrate
1429 2018-04-09 21:15:08 i left the pharmacy carrying a prescription and a guy tried to hit on me by telling me that medication is a scam and that i should throw it out and buy fish oil pills from costco
1430 2018-04-09 21:15:03 I mean, in respect to making makeup stay put. Setting powder has the other function of interacting with the oil of makeup and make it more matte. Setting spray doesn't do that.

*Support for #US oil & gas exploration, exploitation & export on Russia's economy & therefore also sustainability of #PutinOligarchyRegime.

1440 2018-04-09 21:13:43 First of all it’s Not True. Why is it when other countries Drill and Frack for oil and gas it’s progress and ok but when the United States does it then it’s destroying the environment? Canada and other Countries have been fracking since 1947 and they still frack including the US.
1441 2018-04-09 21:13:43 Oil.
1442 2018-04-09 21:13:37 Isn't goo gone essentially mineral oil like baby oil?
1443 2018-04-09 21:13:35 As it will then, be THEIR OIL
1444 2018-04-09 21:13:27 Over 40 First Nations in BC support the Kinder Morgan pipeline.  Let’s get ‘er done, we can’t keep relying on the U.S. market with our oil.

1445 2018-04-09 21:13:25 How did we end up here? Well Jim Carr’s Chief of Staff, is @ZoeCaron and she’s anti oil. This is our minister of natural resources!!
1446 2018-04-09 21:13:24 BUY OIL!
1447 2018-04-09 21:13:18 Ummmmm we don't have a clue what to do. We are spineless liberals and we hate oil.
1448 2018-04-09 21:13:17 Never know why studies are required. Isn't it blazingly obvious that any woman who inhales cleaning fluid fumes daily would have her health compromised? It's like walking down busy street. You're inhaling filth. Result? Cancer. Shall we launch another study? No, says oil industry
1449 2018-04-09 21:13:10 Imagine what  a low oil price and fracking  in the USA  can make people figure out!
1450 2018-04-09 21:13:06 it was mossad, israel killed kids in gaza and now want us in syria because of the oil. Pretext to stop massacers yet they conduct massacres in gaza, and syria but blame it on others. how stupid do politicians think the voters are? Stop the killings do your job
1451 2018-04-09 21:13:06 data produced far less oil
1452 2018-04-09 21:13:05 The goal posts have shifted it's not about the land or minerals or oil, it's about IP. Intellectual property has no boundaries or ties to a piece of land. Our people are being left behind again, education is the key.
1453 2018-04-09 21:13:01 Streamlining destruction of public lands. Forcing BLM employees to wear Oil Rigs on their uniforms. He shows where his priorities like--in the toilet.

1456 2018-04-09 21:12:28 I bet you have a car, laptop, heat your home, eat food etc all supplied by oil! Give them up and maybe we can take you seriously!
1457 2018-04-09 21:12:16 Bro life hack/ ghetto advice if you’re still stuck at work and chapped, rub olive oil on your lips. Just a little. ;)
1458 2018-04-09 21:12:15 , In a province where a huge % of the population have been believing for decades that the oil industry IS cleaning up after itself and replanting after destroying lands, it isn't hard to understand them being stupid about transfer payments. Might be the fumes.

1469 2018-04-09 21:10:57 to be clear i mean retinol (vitamin a) is good and vitamin c is good. rose hip oil has vitamin c and a in it!  i also have an azelaic acid cream that i think has faded a lot of my hyperpigmentation but it takes a long time.
1470 2018-04-09 21:10:45 It's high time you guys learned that your opinions do not equal facts. Talk radio, Alex Jones, Fox News etc... continue a long tradition of snake oil salesmen in America. If you put out news in any form, you should be made to use rigorous source checking.

1473 2018-04-09 21:10:32 I can't believe Scott Pruitt would LIE to us -- about keeping his mistress, meeting with foreign investors for Carl Icahn, sirens to herald his arrival, receiving death threats, allowing Oil and Gas to write his reports...

1476 2018-04-09 21:10:27 Russia best watch their step. We know why Syria is in their interest. As why it's in ours. Oil as always being the forefront for chaos in this region. Pipelines run through Syria so its a matter of control.
1477 2018-04-09 21:10:20 Islamists terrorize the world but EU & UK demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew

How investing in technologies that reduce are good things. Stopping 100% is impossible. As everyone knows.

1487 2018-04-09 21:09:07 They actually hunt them for meat, skin and oil, and it is done in no way like this. Don’t believe everything you see

1496 2018-04-09 21:08:23 Gary, time we admitted there are forces at play not wanting @TransMtn Exp. because they are making a killing on the differential between WTI & WCS. They quietly ship oil south & pocket large profits. Ppln opponents are their stooges & accomplices.
1497 2018-04-09 21:08:22 More $ for fuel, more $ for oil, gotta plug the damn things in....
1498 2018-04-09 21:08:17 First, I think you meant “oil” and second, Alberta isn’t the only province producing oil. It’s not greed to want to employ Canadians and the oil industry has supported Canada for generations. Crawl back into your hole. Hear your home with wood and ride a bike. Hypocrite
1499 2018-04-09 21:08:15 It amazes me.  Last month we saw Libs talking about this raid and that raid and nothing came from it.  Now they’ve put ALL their hopes on this Cohen raid!   What sad, little virtue signaling scum bag snake oil salesmen you Libs are.  
1500 2018-04-09 21:08:05 Here at Fresh Life Now farm we keep the rabbits and deer away with cilantro and nutmeg essential oil. We grew the cilantro last fall. We added 5 drops mixed and put on base of plant.

1505 2018-04-09 21:07:33 Think Trump will neutralize Assad to distract us? Putin would agree only if we conquer Syria and keep Syria ports open for oil transport. I can almost see it.. Sad to say.
1506 2018-04-09 21:07:25 i wanna try using oil paints but i JUST bought more acrylic and i cant afford any
1507 2018-04-09 21:07:22 Just remembered the library program I had about oil spills one time. The presenter poured motor oil in to a (fish-less) fish tank to show how it coats everything. Then, after the program, I caught her rinsing it down the drain in the janitor's closet.
1508 2018-04-09 21:07:21 Hope am that brother!

1 cup coffee grounds
1 cup coconut oil
1/2 cinnamon 
1 cup sugar

Some lavender oil on my pillow...
1514 2018-04-09 21:06:45 The world is gradually moving away from oil and Nigeria is so heavily invested and dependent on it.
1515 2018-04-09 21:06:30 Make sure to do it while the oil is hot in the pan! It more easily dissolved and brings out the best flavor!
1516 2018-04-09 21:06:28 $70 to change my cars oil *cries*
1517 2018-04-09 21:06:24 Just got a free oil change! This is going to be a good week!

1532 2018-04-09 21:04:31 Thank you for asking. Specifications and grade for our hydro oil is proprietary information to Exmark.
1533 2018-04-09 21:04:30 Well, we had car issues. It needed an oil change so instead of taking it to the dealer because of busy week, we went to a shop yesterday, immediately having stalling problems afterwards which wasn't a thing before. $80 and a trip to the dealer today, we hate life choices.

1539 2018-04-09 21:04:15 Saudis are Beni Khyber, Jews from the seventh century who converted to a slam and are very radical that's why the British chose them as the leaders of the new Saudi Arabian country formed in 1932 so they would support Israel and protect them and give them oil now you know
1540 2018-04-09 21:03:58 So you think the oil spill should happen in Canada because you think that's better for the environment? I think Canadians (and logic) would disagree.
1541 2018-04-09 21:03:58 It’s a 1B upgrader...but I agree, should have done it a while back. And once we have it in place, there is still the transportation of refined oil to deal with...
1542 2018-04-09 21:03:43 What battle? Killing & maiming innocent kids & people in schools, churches, nightclubs and country music concerts as though they are animals? How about the farmers in Nebraska? Were they able to stop the government-sanctioned placement of oil pipes on their property with guns?
1543 2018-04-09 21:03:38 And I would also do oil massages/leave oil in my hair with a shower cap over it once a week. And just used less heat on it. But I think ur curls would look popping blonde.
1544 2018-04-09 21:03:33 you can get electricity from wind, water, solar, geothermal...
coal, nuclear and oil aren't the only options
1545 2018-04-09 21:03:32 Except Eastern Canada gets a lot of cheap, reliable oil from the Middle East, so this sensible policy suggestion is dead before it’s born.

1548 2018-04-09 21:03:25 @realDonaldTrump ...I am incensed that the azzholes in your admin, the pentagon, and the state department (lower case intentional), are really willing to destroy everyone on the planet because they don't get to put the oil pipeline through Syria.....

1556 2018-04-09 21:02:41 I have no friends or family involved in the Oil & Gas industry.  That stated if the Kinder Morgan pipeline is approved then arrest the protesters interfering!  Enough of this crap as a Canadian I want our resources going to market.

1560 2018-04-09 21:02:24 America and Israel threatens Iran on a daily basis. It enacts sanctions which is an economic act of war trying to economically destroy the country by ganging up on them through the U.N. They want control of their oil.

1565 2018-04-09 21:01:54 he visto que en corea hay un sitio que hacen olive oil fried chicken y he visto 3 vídeos y me muero del hambre y ahora quiero ir a un kfc
1566 2018-04-09 21:01:52 Nope, I looked. I thought about that, BUT maybe the ale oil itself is wheat and barley? I could add honey and berries, coffee, pine, grapfruit...endless possibilities, but not sure what works best for idea or scents.
1567 2018-04-09 21:01:45 That's Canadian oil leaking on U.S. Soil. Trump's State Department approved it after Trump ordered it. Do not forget in November.

1576 2018-04-09 21:00:51 Corporate greed has it's price. They gave China all our manufacturing jobs to increase profit and now it's time to pay the price. China's economy keeps growing and with that so does their military power. We now even get to compete with them for bidding on oil. Great deal.

1585 2018-04-09 20:58:58 Yes spot on, the UK’S oil revenue should have been much better spent.
1586 2018-04-09 20:58:56 I just found out that I've been saying oil the wrong way for my entire life!
1587 2018-04-09 20:58:56 It’s a new and inclusive OPEC.
“OPEC: We’re here for ALL oil producers, no matter how much you produce”
1588 2018-04-09 20:58:55 But but we have invested oil money ......... its called the London Financial Centre
1589 2018-04-09 20:58:50 @jjhorgan Stop holding up the Kinder Morgan pipeline.  It is the safest way to ship natural gas and oil to ports. You've lost my support with this crappy move. We will become a poor province and even poorer neighbour to AB.

1597 2018-04-09 20:58:27 Think this Oil is a very shy thing
Everytime it comes under the Indy spotlight it seems to shrivel up and project a short lifetime if not its death-throws
1598 2018-04-09 20:58:21 Govt is funding alternative energy projects; their budget = Infrastructure Spending one (ie fix & build stuff while creating jobs). NO way 2 change from Oil based econ 2 anything else immediately. *Transition* requires maintaining sufficient of old while building new #cdnpoli
1599 2018-04-09 20:58:20 Agreed
1600 2018-04-09 20:58:19 We just approved the LNG in BC, we can't be open to everything. BC liberals skirted major  investments from wind, solar & geothermal for over a decade. It's time to diversify our economy. Oil markets fluctuate drastically, jobs aren't stable.
1601 2018-04-09 20:58:11 Can oil corp. put together a pipeline project, which doesn't involve using 50-60 yo pipes? East or West, it's the same BS plan. It's like: "we don't want to invest, but want big $$$ from it." Nobody's getting communities involved either, it's more like droppings bombs everywhere.
1602 2018-04-09 20:57:58 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
1603 2018-04-09 20:57:53 Lauren Mckinnie baths in oil the grease monkey
1604 2018-04-09 20:57:33 The problem with sanctions on Russian "elite" that exclude ressources (presumably to please energy-begging Europe) is their resources are owned by the state. So when ruble goes down they export more in local currency + the oil price goes up on "geopolitical risk".
1605 2018-04-09 20:57:13 @SenBillNelson did a great job today when interviewed by Wolf B. on CNN. Yes, health care, and enjoy that view off the coast with no oil rigs? Thank Bill for that and vote please? 
1606 2018-04-09 20:57:07 This right here is the truth of what's really going on, Israel COMMITTED this gassing in order to blame Assad so they can steal land and oil. It's all a lie ppl wake up.
1607 2018-04-09 20:57:04 AB govt talks non-stop about the importance of bitumen and pipelines to our economy, but so little about the better future we could have by weaning ourselves off this dependence on oil royalties. Where is the vision? #ableg #abpoli #capoli
1608 2018-04-09 20:56:44 Wait... was it the man on the grassy knoll? Or perhaps the Mob that plotted to destroy Canada’s Oil & Gas? Oh wait... nope... it’s own citizens who are whining from their ivory towers while reaping the benefits off the blood sweat and tears of Alberta’s oil workers!
1609 2018-04-09 20:56:41 well if the federal government actually wanted the pipeline bc could have lots to lose.   An increase to the surcharge on oil products to make up for the money lost ... Jet fuel, gasoline, diesel.... could hurt the industries there pretty hard.
1610 2018-04-09 20:56:25 you most likely know this,. but it is best to Boil Mushrooms first for a short time before frying.   Reason to reduce the oil content in the mushrooms and also keeps them more succulent.
1611 2018-04-09 20:56:19 There is a gallon or so of light oil in every 'power pole' transformer. Pop a hole with a .45 from underneath, put the oil in your diesel fuel or heating oil tank.

And the transformer will go boom in a few minutes.
1612 2018-04-09 20:56:12 An oil temp thermometer will calm your fears, you will know if the oil is too hot (or too cold, giving you slimy chicken)
1613 2018-04-09 20:56:06 The BP Oil spill occurred 02/2009 shut down the Gulf. I’m oilfield sales had 6 months in my savings. Proactively called Wells Fargo and told them this and I would not get a paycheck for 6 Months. Commission was 70% of my income.
1614 2018-04-09 20:55:59 Oil companies that have permits to build pipelines have the right to build pipelines without being harassed or obstructed
1615 2018-04-09 20:55:58 @Umich: The Straits of Mackinac is “the worst possible place for an oil spill in the Great Lakes” due to the ecological diversity and fragility of the area #NoMoreLine5
1616 2018-04-09 20:55:48 LOL girl I couldn’t change my oil I got claustrophobic but I did watch my dad do it from start to finish. I feel like I could do it if I didn’t feel like my car was gonna crush me. I’ve bought like 4-5 sets of tires in my lifetime so I that’s why I know to check them. 
1617 2018-04-09 20:55:45 Jai aussi acheté de la bio oil i told u guys I’m ready to have a better skin and better hair
1618 2018-04-09 20:55:34 The sad reality I've noted is that Catholics seem to have turned the U.S Government and military into their own proxy force to steal oil and natural gas and they make fake news to give politicians cover for bombing campaigns and theft.
1619 2018-04-09 20:55:32 Haha awesome! You’re living the dream :)
Now you can bath in that oil AND Reddit karma ;)
1620 2018-04-09 20:55:30 a lady at the store said urijah shouldn’t wear a necklace, because he’s not a girl

1622 2018-04-09 20:55:10 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
1623 2018-04-09 20:55:09 Some people use silicone sheets, but mainly while the scar is forming. Bio oil is supposed to help soften a scar, be careful using it, it is very runny and stains your carpet! (Personal experience).

1625 2018-04-09 20:54:48 When they put anointing oil on you,so  you smell like it for ten weeks.
1626 2018-04-09 20:54:38 I do not believe in any political office holder in this country. You are all beds of same feather. Only after the oil money.
1627 2018-04-09 20:54:16 Too much oil bro..
1628 2018-04-09 20:54:16 Lessons I’ve learned today: wrangling pigs is very difficult, and one should always at least change their clothes afterward, especially if you don’t want to smell like pig shit while waiting four hours for an oil change. (Insert Robert Pickton joke here.)
1629 2018-04-09 20:54:15 I’m scared Trump will start a nuclear war to distract, and to throw a curveball (and to protect oil reserves near by), he will do that to North Korea. I live in Fukuoka, the closest big city to Korea in Japan. I sleeping in a missile bunker until Trump is in jail.
1630 2018-04-09 20:54:04 Same I get anchovies in extra virgin oil as well it makes everything taste better.
1631 2018-04-09 20:54:02 @Valvoline (1/3) Brought my year and a half old Ford Escape 30,000 miles in for an oil change and air filter replacement in Glastonbury, CT.  Two days later I sense a noise coming from engine on acceleration, two days later I had to have it towed to dealership I bought it from..
1632 2018-04-09 20:54:00 I need to get an oil change 
1633 2018-04-09 20:53:56 i want to drown myself in st barths tanning oil and spend five hours laying on the beach reading my favorite books and having the time of my life with someone i love
1634 2018-04-09 20:53:56 Hopefully its just some broken plastic tank or hose or something.. 
As long as the exhaust is clear and does not smell sweet, and no oil in the radiator it should be a cheap fix..
1635 2018-04-09 20:53:41 If a company had a permit to build a pipeline, obstruction is NOT "peaceful protesting". For example, setting up a blockade to stop a woman from getting an abortion is also not "peaceful protesting" either.
Oil spills would be less likely if we transported oil with PIPELINES!
1636 2018-04-09 20:53:31 They'll probably invade Venezuela for their oil reserves, that's my prediction. Venezuela will get invaded at some point by some nation in the future 100%...
1637 2018-04-09 20:53:05 @RobBreakenridge Question I wonder who Quebec would by oil from if they separated, likely Alberta! How long do you think it would take Trump to build Kinder Morgan? Like I've said before Rob, weak,weak, leaders in Canada! It's not good for the whole country!
1638 2018-04-09 20:53:05 Another photo op for you to ask them to praise the Dear Leader again? I cannot wait till you are gone and we can go back to being proper Americans again. You're a snake oil salesman. Trump University anyone? You are weak and are weakeaning our standing in the world.
1639 2018-04-09 20:52:54 Astonishing fact: Norway produced 5% less Oil & Gas than Scotland between 1964 and 2016. 
Where is our money?
Where is our Norwegian living standard?
Where is our 2018 annual Sovereign Wealth fund declaring $131.5Bn profit?
Happy being ripped off in the union?

1642 2018-04-09 20:52:28 I used to blend butter and coffee together (with MCT oil) and it was surprisingly good 
1643 2018-04-09 20:52:23 Yep it’s had tremendous results for many people. I work for a cbd oil company if you have any other specific questions. I personally take it under the tongue and use a 30ml 1000mg tincture
1644 2018-04-09 20:52:23 I need a oil change....
1645 2018-04-09 20:52:20 I've actually walked in wooden shoes as a kid.  Check @CrownstoneRocks for an environmental business which sets yet another step to get away from our oil addiction. Only using electricity/energy when you are present is key to energy savings.
1646 2018-04-09 20:52:17 Trump Sudan is living in the crises of oil and health and electronic blocking Please intervene and thank Trump elegant
1647 2018-04-09 20:52:15 @Valvoline (1/3) Brought my year and a half old Ford Escape 30,000 miles in for an oil change and air filter replacement in Glastonbury, CT.  Two days later I sense a noise coming from engine on acceleration, two days later I had to have it towed to dealership I bought it from...
1648 2018-04-09 20:52:14 The same Republic of Congo that produces a whopping 354 kbo/d? Perhaps the Niobrara tight oil play in Colorado should apply for OPEC membership too!
1649 2018-04-09 20:51:50 @TroyBilt should I drain the oil from my three stage blower for summer storage? Also should I keep fuel with added stabilizer for the summer as well or should it be empty?
1650 2018-04-09 20:51:28 Need some good beard oil, I’m all out 
1651 2018-04-09 20:51:12 If oil companies are going to continue to cause #okquakes, can we at least make them pay enough taxes to teach kids enough math, science, reading, and writing so that someday they will better understand how the world works and be able to do something to make it safer?
1652 2018-04-09 20:51:12 What kind of oil change takes two hours??? 
1653 2018-04-09 20:51:09 When you get an oil change and don’t get any bad news about your car 
1654 2018-04-09 20:51:07 Okay, okay, let's do it
1655 2018-04-09 20:51:05 i remember when i first went vegan it was around the time when hclf and raw til 4 was poppin and i literally thought i was going to die if i ate any healthy fats or had oil lmaooo tbt
1656 2018-04-09 20:50:57 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the 2nd rec room with the dagger!
1657 2018-04-09 20:50:56 Lol I see
1658 2018-04-09 20:50:55 I dont know if I believe that. My brother lives up there and said you could smell the oil yet.
1659 2018-04-09 20:50:48 No spots of oil on the road, that's what I'm looking forward to when all vehicles are electric. Let's start with trucks, buses and Land Rovers.
1660 2018-04-09 20:50:48 I went to get my oil changed today. According to the sticker it had been 5k miles or 8 months (old car, high mileage oil) Somehow the oil was still clean??? The sticker would indicate if it was synthetic, unless they mixed it up and then didn't charge me for it? Fuckin' weird.
1661 2018-04-09 20:50:26 @OSMLFC I wanna run oil on you
1662 2018-04-09 20:50:22 Yes even though tight, this has a big impact on cdn oil.

Suprise this is not being analysed more by Cdn msm. (Not:)
1663 2018-04-09 20:50:10 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1664 2018-04-09 20:50:10 @DannyVaughnVox @dan_reed Hi Both!  Any news on when the Snake Oil shirts will be on their way. Desperate to show it off! Thanks
1665 2018-04-09 20:50:10 The UK won't send in a military presence ... well not until they want #Syria's oil. Then they'll suddently justify butting in and accidently walk away with all the oil!
1666 2018-04-09 20:50:08 “You’ve struck oil, stop drilling”
1667 2018-04-09 20:49:54 Seriously, we all knew. Hillary warned us. Heck HE told us himself many times. Even the mildest amount of curiosity about his past would have uncovered a lifetime of callous opportunism, snake oil sales, grifting and dirty tricks. Nobody should be surprised at this.
1668 2018-04-09 20:49:51 @JustinTrudeau is just another oil company stooge like Steve Harper. Will he let CAPP write the budget, too?
1669 2018-04-09 20:49:47 Nigeria, is in many important ways, dead.

Final nail on the coffin is when crude oil revenues can no longer sustain the greedy elite.
1670 2018-04-09 20:49:46 Be still my beating ! Thanks, Foo !
1671 2018-04-09 20:49:46 Yes. But. Oil companies call for a Co2 tax to *legitimise* their business model, by calling for it set at a price that’s enough to be noticed, but not enough to drastically change oil usage.  A Co2 tax at a 1.5/2 degrees level would be far, far higher to radically shape usage.
1672 2018-04-09 20:49:44 I got oil
1673 2018-04-09 20:49:44 Perfume oil not Pounded yam
1674 2018-04-09 20:49:39 You know you're old school West Indian when the smell of @OLBAS_Remedies, Vicks Vapor rub and Eucalyptus oil doesn't bother you. 
1675 2018-04-09 20:49:30 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
1676 2018-04-09 20:49:22 It's OK to believe God loves the idiot but hates the idiocy -- & the destruction of God's created works for oil as energy, which is now dated, along with the moral decay that festers in the soul of the USA.
1677 2018-04-09 20:49:16 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
1678 2018-04-09 20:49:14 How about money laundering and a plot to bankrupt america and change the world order, as well as getting all the oil they need, which they just did from QATAR
1679 2018-04-09 20:49:08 Hey Kickz just thought I'd touch base about Undead Legacy Great Mod. Started playing after watching you. which I do all the time. anyway there is a desert  west of your location follow road to 395 N 1228 W for oil shale.
also there are clumps to be found in the burnt biome
1680 2018-04-09 20:49:07 Canada's Liberal government is under pressure to push through the  expansion of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's Trans Mountain pipeline from the  Alberta oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia.
1681 2018-04-09 20:48:54 I wish they'd hurry up and devalue already! I got BTC and oil investments that need a little kick baby!
1682 2018-04-09 20:48:46 In some parts in North India guests will think of host as cheap and rude if there is no butter | oil smeared or floating on some items if not all of the food.
1683 2018-04-09 20:48:14 Wouldn’t it be great if the investment dried up before the oil!!! Can you hear that giant asset bubble creaking?!
1684 2018-04-09 20:48:14 So a billionaire was upset that a Democrat won the presidency. In other shocking news, execs from oil and gas companies prefer. Republican president over a Democrat.
1685 2018-04-09 20:48:13 Using oil you may get larger icons
1686 2018-04-09 20:48:11 Interested in what? I can’t see who you’re talking to. Is it trowels? Or oil tankers?
1687 2018-04-09 20:48:03 In case anyone was wondering, it’s taken almost two hours for the Nissan dealership in Murfreesboro to do an oil change and put air in my tires. This is ridiculous. Will I ever get my car back? Probably not.
1688 2018-04-09 20:47:57 I use My Magic Mud brand and it's good!! It's also good as a spot treatment for pimples because it's only charcoal, clay and coconut oil 
1689 2018-04-09 20:47:53 Oil industry in its death throes taking as many with it as it can .soil ,water ,animal life ..possibly us .
1690 2018-04-09 20:47:50 BC has its own oil and gas industry, that's why this pipeline also isn't in National interest and Notely seems to think conflict of interest for a Texan company on behalf of China is smart. Maybe she should stop her trade visits to China #abpoli It's NOT Canada. #yeg #nokm
1691 2018-04-09 20:47:44 Is this true? How does that compare with oil and gas?
1692 2018-04-09 20:47:43 Coconut oil works wonders on your skin.
1693 2018-04-09 20:47:41 It's ok because the oil industry OWNES @senrobportman @WarrenDavidson @EPAScottPruitt and the entire @GOP so it's cool there is no price to pay for polluting our land/water system
1694 2018-04-09 20:47:34 you do realize that most of soy production is used for soybean oil/soy meal in feedstuffs for animal animal??????
1695 2018-04-09 20:47:27 this was just a quick something while my oil got changed in my car, but i decided that we’d just do papa johns for dinner later since he’s been craving it 
1696 2018-04-09 20:47:17 the Superdrug Vitamin E range is actually saving my skin atm !!!!(specifically the skin oil and oatmeal exfoliator)
1697 2018-04-09 20:47:13 Yes, gotta build those roads going to the oil wells! BS...it's all BS
1698 2018-04-09 20:47:10 Oil
1699 2018-04-09 20:47:07 I thought so Ed but I googled it and first thing I saw was oil. Maybe there is shortage of spinach. Anyway this is baffling. Hope it does not sit idle like convenience store on 12th and Powell $2.67 a gallon.
1700 2018-04-09 20:46:36 you can even add a smell to it if you wanna
like some rose or lavender oil so it really "smells" 
"it smells good for us people but not to monsters"
1701 2018-04-09 20:46:33 Oil get another 1st overall and still suck #inept
1702 2018-04-09 20:46:27 Exactly that Jan - I love the way really fresh #veg squeaks! I sauteed it in a little butter & olive oil, with just a couple of grinds of #organic black pepper - it had such a wonderful sweet flavour it need nothing else.
1703 2018-04-09 20:46:16 Thank you all at Greenpeace!  Now that it’s public knowledge that OIL knew from the beginning they were threatening the health and well being of the planet and it’s inhabitants they are doomed.  No morality in corporate culture, only greed.
1704 2018-04-09 20:46:08 O/G is it's own worst enemy - refusing to debate the veracity of #ClimateChange, fight #CarbonTax and promote the economic, hi-tech and social benefits the country derives from oil and gas... they made their bed...@OilGasCanada #TMX
1705 2018-04-09 20:46:03 Coconut oil or cocoa butter lotion!

1709 2018-04-09 20:45:51 His stance on gay rights, drug testing public assistance recipients, until recently wanting big oil offshore...I could go on and on
1710 2018-04-09 20:45:49 I remember it well.  In the mid 90s i Walked out of a meeting with these snake oil salesmen and told them to stuff this B'S where the sun doesn't shine

1715 2018-04-09 20:45:03 Not saying it should not be done, just saying we had a company and sold it. Should have kept it. Also, we did not get lower gas prices out of our govt owned oil co. venture
1716 2018-04-09 20:45:02 Ahh ......Obama the snake oil salesman, why did this country vote for a nobody, never held a job, very sketchy associates, never vetted, yet the country chose the incompetent one.... TWICE Ugh
1717 2018-04-09 20:44:58 that looks amazing! who do you guys use for a oil filter system? 
1718 2018-04-09 20:44:53 If I could put hot oil on everything I would
1719 2018-04-09 20:44:47 Appreciate the stance Bernie, but conversion from fossil fuels to renewables is not overnight, and the economy needs to continue working during a transition. Pipelines are more profitable and safer than Oil transport by rail. It is not an either/or issue.
1720 2018-04-09 20:44:45 20th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement and the only segment ye have on the north is whether or not 2 Brits can play a foreign sport for Ireland. I would've settled for 5 minutes of Tim Pat Coogan oil wrestling Fintan O'Toole. #CBlive
1721 2018-04-09 20:44:33 O ga ghan.

Olu moves like a shadow when food is concerned.

Now now you'll see him.

Now now food is missing.

No trace of oil.

And he'll be wearing white o.

No stain.
1722 2018-04-09 20:44:24 The core problem here is not so much pipelines as petroleum falling prices and Canadian increasing petroleum consumption. If not Canadian petroleum, Canada will import it from Venezuela or elsewhere, and possibly even « dirtier » petroleum than Albertan oil sands. #polcan
1723 2018-04-09 20:44:21 Bullshit eric, it's a false flag. Israel is just stealing oil again, or land, or both. Man Christians love assad, ask them.
1724 2018-04-09 20:44:16 It's Snowing again in Oil City, pa!!
1725 2018-04-09 20:44:10 @NathanDahm When is your bill calling for an end to oil and gas tax credits coming?
1726 2018-04-09 20:44:09 The year is 2058, Earth's oil has nearly nearly run out. What little is left is drunk solely by the mega rich, always served as a shot within a goblet of Red Bull. The People's Republic of Netflix has just declared war on the United States of Hulu. Tennis is illegal.
1727 2018-04-09 20:44:01 I always imagine the smallest of Rabbit’s friends and relations to be an oil beetle.
1728 2018-04-09 20:43:48 I prefer sesame oil.
1729 2018-04-09 20:43:45 @broightergold Leona, your hickory smoked oil is unbelievable! I've used it to make homemade oven chips and they are delicious (if I do say so myself). Hope the weekend went well for you x
1730 2018-04-09 20:43:45 I understand that both those terminals have been shutdown for routine maintenance.  Thus , where is that oil coming from?

1733 2018-04-09 20:43:32 Caprese is tomato, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, salt. Balsamic is not part of the equation.
1734 2018-04-09 20:43:29 @armstrongcbc I just watched your piece on the news, with the 2 oil industry heavyweights. There is justly still a lot of concern about the truthfulness of the motivation behind the KM pipeline. Trudeau can say science is with him all he wants, but it doesn’t make it true. (1)
1735 2018-04-09 20:43:14 Buzzed hair is super soft, and I bet he uses beard oil to maintain his facial hair's softness.
1736 2018-04-09 20:43:10 Came to get my oil change at the right time
1737 2018-04-09 20:43:02 Thanks! And yay, I found it at another store close by!  Can’t live without my  MCT oil!!
1738 2018-04-09 20:42:55 Hey there friends! We have been getting multiple calls today about products being in stock, especially our CBD products and Rick Simpson Oil. Please try to understand that we are trying to get things back in stock as soon as we possibly can
1739 2018-04-09 20:42:50 Cue the $280,000 to be wasted on the inquiry into why our oil industry is in decline.
1740 2018-04-09 20:42:39 Did you read this Donald ? They are going to kick our butts in this and there is no question it is the future. While you hold onto oil gas and coal.
1741 2018-04-09 20:42:36 Bro Fenty body lava just looks like oil mixed with glitter :/ I am disappointed.

1743 2018-04-09 20:42:31 Great news. Good riddance. Big Oil has long since shown itself to be an enemy of mankind.

1749 2018-04-09 20:41:31 What nerve  that thing will leak oil
1750 2018-04-09 20:41:31 come rub this coconut oil all over my booty
1751 2018-04-09 20:40:58 And coconut oil is not just for hair so 
1752 2018-04-09 20:40:56 not sure how a pipeline under the ground in a province makes them rich. Oil companies? Sure, but not the suckers who take the risks of spills for a dying industry that has never paid its share of the costs of its products
1753 2018-04-09 20:40:46 My preference is for oil and vinegar and bacon drippings.  Agreed on Miracle Whip, sorry @JimMcMahon
1754 2018-04-09 20:40:37 Holiday here, oil painting class is off for another week yet.

1759 2018-04-09 20:40:16 Take all those arrested, transport them to a camp of tents about 80 kms. off the Dempster Highway, on the way to Inuvik, air drop basic necessities once a week, andonly pick them up hours before their presence is required in court.  No phones, no electricity, no oil or propane.
1760 2018-04-09 20:40:16 And there you have the problem with nearly all EVs except Tesla, they are design for commuter cars and if you don’t want to burn oil as soon as you drive longer distances then Tesla is the only option. Nissan says they are leader of EV but don’t make EV for long trips.
1761 2018-04-09 20:40:10 @RachelNotley and @jkenney I think we should slow the flow of oil and nat gas to all of Canada not just BC! This will wake the country up!

1771 2018-04-09 20:39:03 it's like Nashville hot chicken but the oil soaks up all the spice instead so it stays crispy instead of gettin soggy
1772 2018-04-09 20:38:59 for the same reason our tax dollars support the oil industry in Alberta, and the Auto sector in Ontario.

1775 2018-04-09 20:38:13 Here is a fine example on how the people of BC are not and will never be her concern. She wants to hurt us into submission. In the event of an oil spill she will certainly blame BC and find a way to wash her hands off her responsibilities.

- #ISIS support
- land/oil appropriation

1790 2018-04-09 20:36:51 Surely Iceland was allowed to get away with taking control of nearby seas cos the 2 countries which fished there - UK & Norway - were doing the same trick over control of oil.

1793 2018-04-09 20:36:43 Sounds like he’s been gargling motor oil.
1794 2018-04-09 20:36:32 Minister, why don't u implement climate plan in stages, 1st to eliminate ALL CDN coal power ASAP. Then incentivize the fuel CDN fuel refining system to stop using imported oil. If U still want a CO2 tax do not impose it on oil/gas that is being exported. That's nuts.
1795 2018-04-09 20:36:23 Need more obfuscation on those names, some nice oil and gas companies in there

1798 2018-04-09 20:36:05 I was hyper-sensitive to teaching our kids to eat actual food, not junk food. Now that they are grown and gone, we buy much less at the stores. I like real cheese, not whipped vegetable oil, so I don't buy KRAFT anything. We buy a few food items at the store (meats, organics, TP)
1799 2018-04-09 20:36:03 Why don’t you invest in a oil refinery to increase the value of your oil?
1800 2018-04-09 20:35:57 Forget the rhetoric ..how has buhari demonstrated tribalism?...yes like chibok like dapchi but what response and result did we see from the two incidents...plus these days, how many territories does the BH hold?...Economy?..heard of oil dependency?
1801 2018-04-09 20:35:49 She sure uses a lot of oil
1802 2018-04-09 20:35:31 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1803 2018-04-09 20:35:14 Lisa McKenzie, whose thoroughly debunked work is routinely cited by anti-fossil fuel activists, has published yet another study attempting to link health issues to oil and gas development in Colorado.

1808 2018-04-09 20:34:48 Netanyahu and friends want all the oil fields, so they play dirty and kill innocent people and blame Assad. Saudi and Israel want access to Syria and Iran. Nikki Hayley you have Palestinians blood on your hands, and you have no credibility, Israel's puppet.
1809 2018-04-09 20:34:47 Those that say news does not matter have never day traded crude oil. CL holding up even as ES breaks, which is a switch.

1815 2018-04-09 20:33:29 If your republican precedent presidents did not make up WMD from bunch of lies and invade Iraq for no reason other than satisfying oil companies, then there wouldn't be a disaster after all. This is THE reason for all Middle East mess including those in Turkey.
1816 2018-04-09 20:33:27 If anyone needs me I moved to @CapChevyAustin. I came in for an oil change at 1 PM and they are still not done so I guess I live here now. Someone favor me some food, my phone is on 10% just like my heart.
1817 2018-04-09 20:33:19 I also think we should have a federal trade embargo on oil from corrupt countries, which would also make consumers think about how to source energy ethically and locally

1821 2018-04-09 20:33:06 I think you are confusing the oil industry with the automotive industry in Ontario or perhaps the aerospace industry in Quebec, or maybe the shipbuilding industry. The oil industry continues to “prop up” the Canadian economy. It’s not asking for handouts, just the rule of law.

1823 2018-04-09 20:32:57 I think people are being much too hard on Gov. Palin...she did not reference the country in which she would seek office. Barama, Kumranistan, and Qumran are all reported to have extensive oil reserves (and all are countries in fiction novels).
1824 2018-04-09 20:32:50 This is the typical response of Canadian based fans. If this was the American fan base you would have had the opposite result. I’m not saying this is good or bad, just pointing out the disparity

1827 2018-04-09 20:32:34 So, how do you explain Israel's vast success and the arab world's horrific failure? The arab world has plenty of oil money to buy pretty much anything they want....
1828 2018-04-09 20:32:26 The most likely scenario is that oil prices will at some point enter a terminal decline as renewable energy costs continue to drop.  Marginal oil producers will go bankrupt en masse and there will be an enormous mess for "somebody" to clean up.

1830 2018-04-09 20:32:02 The more shit you put on your face the more shit there is to clog your pores. The more oil you strip off your face, the drier and more irritated it gets. Don’t get me started on charcoal and those stupid peel masks.

1832 2018-04-09 20:31:47 Fascinating! If the toxic chemicals in question come from the oil or natural gas used in plastic making, and the oil/natural gas came from plants, would they be considered toxins? I'm guessing not, since the plants probably didn't produce them in the first place back in the day.

1836 2018-04-09 20:31:11 I will not vote for him.  Been voting in FL 20+ yrs, he is a snake oil salesman. Hope Rubio gets voted out as well.
1837 2018-04-09 20:31:03 Bill Nelson has been a great defender of the environment in the age of Trump, he has worked valiantly to stop the scourge of offshore oil drilling and combat climate change and sea level rise, which he, unlike Marco Rubio, acknowledges as being real and man made.
1838 2018-04-09 20:31:01 I have a pile of working I need to finish up. Had plans to burn the mid night oil. Flu is creeping up on me, I took flu medication. I am now feeling drowsy. Guess ngubani ijoke.

1842 2018-04-09 20:30:26 You can't fucking fight climate change by burning fossil fuels. How about you push to get alberta and the rest of the country away from oil. Oil is a dying industry make the change before it goes completely belly up or your econ will crash again like it did a few years ago.
1843 2018-04-09 20:30:23 Syria is a relatively small oil producer, accounting for just 0.5 percent of the global production in 2010.

1854 2018-04-09 20:29:12 The Feds have no problem bailing out bombardier or the auto industry so why not the oil and gas sector? They may actually see a return on their investment this time.

1856 2018-04-09 20:29:07 Agreed that "psychological profiles" were snake oil, but there was more. Elections are an arms race. Teddy Goff, Clinton's head of digital strategy focused on conventional ads and world-of-mouth via social media from Clinton's supporters.

1866 2018-04-09 20:27:00 We know why there is support for Pruitt, and most of it falls back on the benefits for gas and oil companies on deregulation, and what seems to benefit Pruitt as well. The possible impact on the oceans, fresh water, air and natural resources......

1868 2018-04-09 20:26:51 It's going to hurt electric car companies the most. Just like the tariffs on solar. Dig deep enough into the trade war and you will see that it's all about oil.
1869 2018-04-09 20:26:45 So I just got my first jar of coconut oil. How do people stand having this on their skin or hair? It's still very much, you know, oily.
1870 2018-04-09 20:26:41 Sanctions are just to keep competition away and allow companies with right connections to make even more money because they can buy oil, rare earth metals etc at prices way below real marketvalue and sell them in legaal circuit
1871 2018-04-09 20:26:31 'Bold actions' you mean selling our national parks to big oil

1873 2018-04-09 20:26:27 Because of the same reason as Trudeau isn't. protestors paid by foreign actors who have ulterior motives to not seeing Canadian oil in the marketplace. 

So get off your anti CPC high horse. This affects all Canadians no matter their politics.

1905 2018-04-09 20:22:35 Notley can't control which direction oil flows -- only overall production levels. But I suppose she could say "Will no one rid me of this meddlesome BC Government?!?" and the oil shippers could decide to reduce shipments all on their own? Nothing would surprise me anymore...

1911 2018-04-09 20:22:08 Right . Baby oil and gold glitter 
1912 2018-04-09 20:22:07 Most important would be to know who in fact is funding the rather sophisticated objections and legal work. My guess is American interests wanting to remain in the shadows but having much to gain by having Canadian oil run through their pipelines.
1913 2018-04-09 20:21:59 It’s not dirty but you’re ok with oil from places like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela. Great human rights track records over there.

1920 2018-04-09 20:21:03 Literally, no one disagrees with Bernie, that we should be seeking alternative energy sources and moving away from fossil fuels. But, now, back to reality and the present, we are dependent on oil and pipelines are the safest means of transporting oil.
1921 2018-04-09 20:20:59 Well there's always Mars. I like Elon Musks plans for it. Great blueprint..seeing our Koched out leaders like oil stains and money over life and technological advancement. Big sun out there..pretty big and full of energy!

1923 2018-04-09 20:20:53 He doesn’t want a pipeline to benefit Canadians. His family is in the oil business, been for centuries. Hence the close ties to the Middle East! Would encroach on his profits
1924 2018-04-09 20:20:53 I'm glad my girl knows her way around cars so that when she goes to get things taken care of like her inspection or an oil change I know she's not going to get ripped off
1925 2018-04-09 20:20:45 New strawberry soap and lavender lotion and tea tree oil :)
1926 2018-04-09 20:20:34 Lol oil change  not just lol change x
1927 2018-04-09 20:20:14 Saved you a click: Definition of oleaginous. 1 : resembling or having the properties of oil : oily; also : containing or producing oil. 2 : marked by an offensively ingratiating manner or quality.
1928 2018-04-09 20:20:10 Hi! Sams are awesome. Obviously @PolitiBunny, but also @SamuelMarcLowe @SAshworthHayes @Samfr @s8mbr @SamHooper @_samcorfield @SamDoesPolitics @s8mb @hamandcheese @Sam_Dumitriu
1929 2018-04-09 20:20:01 Like we give a fuck as you do not give a fuck about the oil industry as it will be paying for your mortgage net going to Quebec like always. Get off your ass and use the federal powers to put BC in it place.
1930 2018-04-09 20:19:55 Someone else burning the midnight oil... yeah -- that photo though was  about three days ago which was the hottest recently. In fact the hot  season is very mild this April and we have had rain a few times.
1931 2018-04-09 20:19:54 #A3 northbound between A3100 and A247 nr #Guildford. 1 lane (of 3) remains closed due to a 2 car collision and overturned vehicle earlier. There's oil and debris still to clear and barrier repairs required before lane closure can be removed. Minor delays in the area.
1932 2018-04-09 20:19:52 That is exactly right! They got a 6,000 raise first! Now they want more money for that schools! They taxed our Oil and Gas Industry, which was just recovering! They want to raise our State Taxes again! So Oklahoma can just forget about The National Tax cuts! Enough!
1933 2018-04-09 20:19:47 I mixed mine with coconut oil, idk what it does though, probably conditions
1934 2018-04-09 20:19:41 Cooking something in hot oil, with no shirt on, is bravery personified.
1935 2018-04-09 20:19:34 I'm not clever enough to get into the politics of what's happening again in Syria but it just seems that while there is oil there will never be peace in the middle east
1936 2018-04-09 20:19:18 Hold Pruitt accountable. He has treated our national parks as if they were the play ground of our gas, oil, and lumber corporations. He has stolen people's rights to their parks by eliminating millions of acreage. Not to mention his elimination of carbon dioxide protections.
1937 2018-04-09 20:19:12 Or they could upgrade the existing refineries out east to process it so those refineries wouldn't have to depend on importing foreign oil, but I guess Montreal's mayor told @JustinTrudeau he couldn't do it so now it's BC's problem.
1938 2018-04-09 20:19:09 shit in your hands and rub it in ur eyes, same concept with oil.
1939 2018-04-09 20:19:05 Need some oil Sheen....
1940 2018-04-09 20:19:01 I feel really rude being on my phone while these guys change my oil but I'm super awkward and don't know what to do with myself right now
1941 2018-04-09 20:19:01 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1942 2018-04-09 20:19:01 Its a 2016 article sir. Oil prices have since swung up. But I do get your point
1943 2018-04-09 20:18:53 put it in a pan with some olive oil to saute it. five minutes later, there will be barely any spinach left. it evaporates.
1944 2018-04-09 20:18:42 last night I ran out of lemon essential oil and my bf looks at me and says it should be here in a couple days. um I luv u
1945 2018-04-09 20:18:29 "We just want common-sense horticulture legislation," they said.
1946 2018-04-09 20:18:17 A ridiculous, irrelevant question, since we are not at a point where America’s oil needs can be replaced with wind and solar. The only relevant question is how do pipelines compare to other methods of oil transportations? Answer: They are far safer.
1947 2018-04-09 20:18:16 Maybe with turpentine oil? Depends on what kind of color they used...
1948 2018-04-09 20:18:15 I just want to stop and thank @ashweissenbach for telling me to put coconut oil in coffee...it’s so creamy and good oh my goodness
1949 2018-04-09 20:18:09 Any theories on Trump, Putin, Netanyahu and Syria? 

I’m losing the thread. Initially, it seemed Putin put Trump in place to facilitate a pipeline across Syria & Big Oil crony Tillerson was Sec of State to facilitate. 

Now Trump throws mixed signals & Tillerson is gone. #syria
1950 2018-04-09 20:18:08 Two hours for a oil change nmms
1951 2018-04-09 20:17:57 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for blue butterfly powder, and put some moon dust essential oil in my diffuser.
1952 2018-04-09 20:17:54 Have you tried a higher potency of CBD oil?
1953 2018-04-09 20:17:39 Unfortunately weaker RUB while improving exporters P&L hurts everyone else who has to buy imported goods and equipment and pay currency debt. In 2014 RUB sold off on a back of Ukraine situation and falling oil prices and foreigners selling RUB risk assets
1954 2018-04-09 20:17:25 just castor oil or do you mix it with anything??
1955 2018-04-09 20:17:25 @TimmyTrill how’s that beard oil
1956 2018-04-09 20:17:14 My vape pen tastes like sesame oil, AMA.
1957 2018-04-09 20:17:07 Chillin waiting for an oil change what about y’all?
1958 2018-04-09 20:16:56 Stop oil right as we become a leading exporter? You know socialism will take money to implement right?
1959 2018-04-09 20:16:50 @JUULvapor must be absolutely thrilled with all the free publicity they are getting from public health cranks terrified of losing their jobs due to the ineffective nature of the snake oil they’ve been peddling for decades.
1960 2018-04-09 20:16:46 Thanks!
1961 2018-04-09 20:16:40 Oh man girl I grew out my brows one summer and put castor oil on every night and it worked! It just smells weird

1968 2018-04-09 20:15:53 Wait and see, she just has to  "suspend" permits for pipelines going west and the oil companies where OK when it was done before and will be again - hell they're losing money every day so losing a bit more will be money well spent (lost) if it works like it did before
1969 2018-04-09 20:15:47 @NuxeUK please help , loving my sparky body oil and apparently so does my 11 year old who has lost the spray cap ! Can we get a replacement ?
1970 2018-04-09 20:15:33 They didn't even taste palm oil with garri.
1971 2018-04-09 20:15:29 But not for oil industry?  Or aviation industry? Agriculture? Why is governement in the business of tipping capitalism?
1972 2018-04-09 20:15:20 Millenialism Christ or justified belief’s claim to align the strata of oil and the gaps, making sense that it as far as Derleth
1973 2018-04-09 20:15:16 yup! I use it right after applying body butter & dry oil so I glisten and glow 
1974 2018-04-09 20:15:15 When next they tell you all oil wells are own by Northerners, hiss and walkaway.
Check list on my wall.
1975 2018-04-09 20:14:47 I was told it would be over Saudi Oil.
1976 2018-04-09 20:14:46 Make the oil stop flowing and the renewables will be implemented as fast as they can be built. The way landfills were shut down was by people stopping news ones being built and old ones expanded.
1977 2018-04-09 20:13:54 Butter is a dairy product(made with cream/milk). Margerine is an oil-based product(made with veg oil&water)
1978 2018-04-09 20:13:43 And remember folks if you're against bombing countries&slaughtering people because Israel wants access to other countries oil reserves you will be labelled a traitor&a coward.
1979 2018-04-09 20:13:43 Yeah I know, I've done tons of runs of the first two games, and Mordecai is my main on the first game. It just seemed rather dramatic since the footage was from the 1st game. He never screamed like that when I was trying to get 25 off shore oil cans! (I might have tho)

1982 2018-04-09 20:13:11 this is basically the whole oil and gas industry
1983 2018-04-09 20:13:01 Plastic comes from oil. Childrens's toys are made from plastic. Are you against children having toys? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1984 2018-04-09 20:12:52 @duffgoldman I’m hoping my imaginary celebrity husband (that’s you) could answer a cake question... why do you have to make 3 wells in depression cake to keep the vinegar, vanilla, and oil separate before adding water?
1985 2018-04-09 20:12:42 I once wrote a comment during Harper’s years about the risk of « putting all Canadian eggs in the same oil basket » instead of diversifying through intensive research and development of alternative ways and technologies. #polcan
1986 2018-04-09 20:12:37 This Minister has “ no answers “ . The Trudeau Federal Liberals are liars and most incompetent ministers ever OR they want to destroy the oil industry! Which one Trudeau?
1987 2018-04-09 20:12:31 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic
It's time you stepped up to protect the Antarctic by ditching krill oil products now!
1988 2018-04-09 20:12:29 He just need their oil and that pipeline through Syria
1989 2018-04-09 20:12:27 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic please help protect the arctic and the creatures who live there by ditching products with krill oil in them.
1990 2018-04-09 20:12:18 I think it may have something to do with US oil companies who control  the refineries. I think...  If we could get the dilbit through Quebec to  New Brunswick, I'm pretty sure the Irvings would refine it.
1991 2018-04-09 20:12:17 Heyman says NEB decision failed to take into account impacts to British Columbia and how difficult it would be to clean up oil spill. #bcpoli
1992 2018-04-09 20:12:08 The secret is wet sanding with oil, gives it a very nice polished finish.
1993 2018-04-09 20:12:01 @BootsUK ditch the Krill oil guys - please! #saveouroceans x
1994 2018-04-09 20:11:59 Every 2,800 years, there could be a major oil spill. 20% higher risk than today. That’s the reality of the risk assessment.
1995 2018-04-09 20:11:32 I’d rather use American oil than foreign oil and have American jobs they produce it
1996 2018-04-09 20:11:25 True say, I dont even think the oil they cook it in is legit kosher.
1997 2018-04-09 20:11:22 Exception: omg my oily nose makes it look like I’m wearing a highlighter when it’s just oil haha so cool 

Reality: rude ass painful pimples forming around your nose
1998 2018-04-09 20:11:20 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1999 2018-04-09 20:11:19 I understand your concern as an Albertan, but 1) please don't take it personally, the goal is to stop oil everywhere not just in AB, 2) the atmosphere needs much less GHG ASAP, and 3) there are other jobs & technologies & sources to replace oil & gas.
2000 2018-04-09 20:11:05 Omg waiting for an oil change is torture

2010 2018-04-09 20:10:01 The SP was in long enough and  had enough years with big oil money to fix the roads. They thought the boom would last forever because they aren't the brightest bulbs. But sure, keep blaming the NDP

2013 2018-04-09 20:09:35 Dude, there wasn't free oil. There wasn't even that. Literally men were sent in there to remove the threat of Saddam for Israel and secure Oil refineries for countries who were selling it for outrageous prices back in the West. Stop looking with the premise that Israel is good.

2015 2018-04-09 20:09:28 Fort Mac literally caught fire, and prices at the pump barely increased. This isn't about Alberta oil supply to BC. It's about giving away raw product to foreign corporations for minimal royalties that they won't even collect half the time.

2020 2018-04-09 20:09:10 Here's another statement for you:  Saudi Arabia is the biggest procurer of blond haired, blue-eyed children and infants for sexual exploitation, kidnapped around the globe and paid for with Saudi's obscene oil money.  Just a little hobby of theirs. (Nothing to do with religion.)
2021 2018-04-09 20:09:05 Anyone need an oil change?
2022 2018-04-09 20:09:02 We love you Ben. And at least I love you Will. But I must ask the independent adjudicator @HuggyDave - are Ben and Will good enough for Britain?
2023 2018-04-09 20:08:59 Let's keep moving oil by train. Hmmmm. How SAFE is that?
2024 2018-04-09 20:08:40 Don't forget about gas which has become more important than oil. Iran ranks first in natural gas reserves according to BP.

2030 2018-04-09 20:08:11 I love the smell of burnt oil in the morning. It smells like freedom!
2031 2018-04-09 20:08:11 That’s such BS,Canada is one of the most stable,expanding rich in oil nations in the world and if KM moves out the next big company will jump at the chance to invest.
2032 2018-04-09 20:08:07 I been running all day  still got get a lawyer & ah oil change
2033 2018-04-09 20:08:00 Only if they're on sale! Wait for a good sale and stock up! Highly recommend the foaming kind (I'm lazy) and the ones with oil in them for dry hands in the winter. K, bye

2038 2018-04-09 20:07:46 Good job @okiefarmer1. Look out your window.  Guess what industries are keeping Ag afloat and paying the bills for them.  Yep Oil and Gas and Wind.  Why is it Ag is alway broke?
2039 2018-04-09 20:07:34 I have zero regrets of it... I learned how to change oil and change a tire before any girl I know... Worth it!
2040 2018-04-09 20:07:30 Had a Civic come back from a dealer maintenance check. Let my wife take it for a oil change later at a local place (non dealer). They tried to tell her the brakes needed work. I let them know they are cheats
2041 2018-04-09 20:07:29 Oh please this NDP government is anti oil and gas just look at who the people are at protests. Posers

2044 2018-04-09 20:07:26 Scott Pruitt is a CROOK! An Oil&Gas Industry Advocate in the most corrupt manner.  He is erasing rules that protect lives.  He works to make BIG RICH MEN, richer & children sick w asthma & cancer. Everything he does will end up in court, costing us all even MORE. We all lose.
2045 2018-04-09 20:07:12 For years, I went to a Thanksgiving dinner that included a deep-fried turkey precariously lowered with an improvised contraption into a giant pot of boiling oil. But for some reason frying a few pieces of chicken in my house is more nerve-wracking.
2046 2018-04-09 20:07:06 You can tweet about Olive Oyle's bmi. (Swear she was banting...olive oil...spinach....!) 
2047 2018-04-09 20:07:05 On my first day of vacation I got my oil changed.
2048 2018-04-09 20:06:57 Not likely.  When BC goes broke, the history will say : "Why did those people stand in the way of one of the largest sources of Canadian income when there were no viable alternative sources of income to replace $ from oil that fund our social programs" #cdnpoli #bcpoli @jjhorgan

2052 2018-04-09 20:06:32 About sixty-seven (67) oil licenses won't be renewed in 2019. Hmm! Little wonder why we have sponsored attack everywhere...
2053 2018-04-09 20:06:29 Anyone use CBD oil? Let me know your experience with it. My doctor recommended it, so I’m trying to get all the info I can. Thank you! 
2054 2018-04-09 20:06:05 Venezuela, world's largest oil reserves,  is under political siege and military threat from the USA because it already has switched from the petro-dollar for its oil transactions to petro-yuan...Just as Russia, China,  and Iran are doing so.

Dollar supremecy days are numbered.
2055 2018-04-09 20:06:01 Saudis are the problem in Middle East,American Obsession with Iran have nothing to do with Democracy or NUKE. It is The Saudi and Israeli wish to dominate Middle East.the Saudi scum bags are using the oil money for protection, and Israeli have THIER NUKE.

2061 2018-04-09 20:04:55 Only the feds can regulate commerce amongst the provinces like this Alberta would have to reduce oil flows without discrimination to which province basically stabbing itself and every other province in the front.

2065 2018-04-09 20:04:38 Why do you think Israel is the reason we are in the middle east? Its clearly because of oil and natural gas. Those things have nothing to do with Israel. 

We want Assad out so we can install our own nat gas pipeline so we can sell to Europe instead of the Russians.
2066 2018-04-09 20:04:38 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

2071 2018-04-09 20:04:10 In this metaphor, the bucket of oil is jack, right?
2072 2018-04-09 20:04:07 Well because Daddy Putin and a bunch of old white men smelling of oil and greed told him to oh wait I'm sorry the answer he will give if any is "uh deregulation is good for children" and then just stare blankly if asked any follow up questions
2073 2018-04-09 20:03:50 My doctor told me I’m allergic to coconut oil but I refuse to accept it 
2074 2018-04-09 20:03:50 Bout to put oil all over my body and turn into a glazed donut.
2075 2018-04-09 20:03:49 U know I have power
2076 2018-04-09 20:03:46 They must be sick of it especially the women. It is so far fine due to oil richs. But they will eventually run out.
2077 2018-04-09 20:03:41 Billions in subsidies to oil companies that will produce more than a trillion dollars worth of revenue for the country over the next 20 years all while holding extremely high environmental standards that improve daily.
2078 2018-04-09 20:03:40 Cannabis oil kills cancer.  Magnesium also kills cancer consumed from whole food sources.  turmeric, the spice is a cancer killer.
2079 2018-04-09 20:03:34 I believe I read somewhere Putin wants the ports to transport his oil that is landlocked. I can't say with  certainty and I don't remember the source, but it makes sense.
2080 2018-04-09 20:03:07 Has anyone checked his bank accounts for payoffs from energy,  oil companies? Bet he has emea or Caribbean hidden bank accounts. ,maybe even in his kids names.

2082 2018-04-09 20:02:56 Isn't GMB owned by Rupert Murdoch? The war profiteering scumbag whose company Genie Oil's success depends on ousting Assad & replacing him with a western puppet. The same Murdoch who also has investments with a number of weapons manufacturers. The same one for whom war = $$$.
2083 2018-04-09 20:02:53 So they are gonna raise price they pay for the oil and gold they claim to be soon backing their currency with (but not really)?
2084 2018-04-09 20:02:43 No, you Dems are a joke & who can help but laugh.  Oil spills & water pollution were the norm under Obama -  the BP spill?  How about the tar sand oil spill into the Kalamazoo River?? How about in Schumer's back yard - all the people in NYS drinking toxic water?? LOL!
2085 2018-04-09 20:02:41 It’s this oil one from pure romance lol I don’t think I showed it to you, wore it everyday sophomore year

2089 2018-04-09 20:02:07 Where is trump planning on getting the $$$ to “make it up” to farmers due to trade war. Is he hoping to create more from oil drilling in Yosemite National Park. Maybe he has a secret way to get $$$ from Russia. #TradeWars #ImpeachTrump
2090 2018-04-09 20:02:07 I guess I should have had a drawing at 710. LoL Cannafam, gets the joke? 710 upside down and backwards is oil. Like hashish oil.;)
2091 2018-04-09 20:01:57 That's not what it was about, I'm tired of hearing that same bullshit lie over and over, yet where's the fucking free oil? where's Israel's peace? Palestine is attacking every day claiming to be the victim, newsflash, if they stop attacking, they'll stop getting their ass kicked.
2092 2018-04-09 20:01:36 This is trash and an absolute waste of legal resources. Peaceful protesting where people block a road?? Where is the criminality in that?? Can’t stand our fucking legal system! Spend time on something that matters! I dunno- perhaps like oil spills that kill our environment!
2093 2018-04-09 20:01:32 All you need is some olive oil and Jojoba oil  but that’s if you already got it it ain’t gone help you get em 
2094 2018-04-09 20:01:25 I had a proper double take, then the oil filter position and then the horrors came back of stuck oil filter.

2125 2018-04-09 19:58:28 yeah for sure, I will be happy to see the industry go, but at the same time I think even the most ambitious timelines will take us decades to wean off oil and in the meantime do you keep with the same old inefficient infrastructure? I guess I don't know. depends on the numbers.

2137 2018-04-09 19:57:35 Its all about oil. Trump wants to go to war with Iran. 10% of proven oil reserves are in Iran. We went to war with Iraq for oil. Iran is next on the list. Wake up.

2140 2018-04-09 19:57:25 Why not invest in building your own oil refinery?
2141 2018-04-09 19:57:19 Your answer is embedded in your question. Gas prices are climbing precisely *because* we're exporting more oil.
2142 2018-04-09 19:57:14 That's stupid. Let's get out of Syria and leave all these oil grounds to Russia and Iran.
2143 2018-04-09 19:57:14 I love it..I heard someone else call him a bloviated ignoramus & I  cracked up laughing. He is all that & more. BTW, I hate to see our hard working farmers taken in by him. He's nothing but a lying sack of BS. #DonTheCon is nothing but a  crooked snake oil salesman. 
2144 2018-04-09 19:57:12 The NeoCon warmongers will have their war. The weapons makers will sell their weapons. The gas and oil companies will get their hydrocarbons. The US will keep it’s footprint in the Middle East. And it matters not who is in the White House.

2146 2018-04-09 19:56:59 It is up to Iran to engage in the west to sell their oil, unfortunately the US does not like other countries that are key power players

2148 2018-04-09 19:56:41 you are just parroting the same nonsense as all the other idiots, Inflation in Germany just hit it's highest level in 5 yrs, if they have to increase interest rates all the low GDP members are in trouble, UK inflation was due to a rise in oil prices.

2161 2018-04-09 19:55:46 Did you know that there's more oil under the Falklands than there's ever been under the middle east?
2162 2018-04-09 19:55:41 I have the worst experience with the finish of that foundation! Have you tried adding one to two drops of oil to it before applying? It may help with the dryness.
2163 2018-04-09 19:55:30 We don't owe them Mexico does they have billionaires there making money off their oil and other things like cell phones
2164 2018-04-09 19:55:29 @bcalmanac your last caller is right! We can not trust BIG oil!!!!
2165 2018-04-09 19:55:24 Fight for what? A decent environment to leave as a legacy for future generations? Too late for that. The tar sands extraction has decimated the environment. Alberta has been destroyed by oil greed. Are you prepared to share that truth with your kids?
2166 2018-04-09 19:55:23 Went to get an oil change, they told me my battery is so bad that it could die at anytime  praying to be able to get a new car sooner rather than later

2170 2018-04-09 19:54:50 There are plenty of pipelines that are being illegally built right now which is why it’s a huge deal for everyone. Even if a pipeline manages to avoid spilling/leaking oil, they are bound to have “man camps” which draw their own set of problems to communities affected by pipeline
2171 2018-04-09 19:54:39 Yes mate shes drove well, quite happy mate, needs a good muck out n degreasing, agricultural engineers van so stinks of hydraulic oil n grease,  nice on road and everything works on her

2174 2018-04-09 19:54:19 Maybe but RUB also took a beating. My argument was simple: div yld was close to PE, earnings were growing as economy recovers and global energy stocks had lagged the rise in the oil price. It was one of my 10 surprises for the year, so have to stick with it.

2178 2018-04-09 19:53:58 Well it is our yard. It would be unreasonable for anyone to think that we are not going to fight for the health of our yard.

But I'm thinking of your yard too. Would it not be better for Albertans to attract corps that is environmentally safe rather than the tired used oil?
2179 2018-04-09 19:53:57 McGwire couldnt stay healthy early in his career. He hit titanic Home runs long before he ever was accused of juicing. He wouldve hit in the high 50's but not 70. Bonds wpuldve never reached 50. He was leaking oil as a player before he started juicing
2180 2018-04-09 19:53:47 This is why China launching oil contract.  If oil in USD only, China's current acct will get crushed.  If China can print CNY for oil, it won't.  See our podcast on @realvision last week.
2181 2018-04-09 19:53:46 I gotta confess, that when I first saw tonights image my immediate thought was K75RT  Thankfully I took my time. It was Wheels/ pipes/Oil filter that gave it away in the end. that and the fact it's not a K75...
2182 2018-04-09 19:53:44 Naw you 13’ bruh. Tell me how much chicken you want and how many cups of oil. You get set owt offtop.

2184 2018-04-09 19:53:37 Mary Fallin is hoping that her state splits wide open and swallows up all the teachers and students so she doesn't have to worry about that expense. It makes it easier to kiss the asses of the fraking and oil companies in her state.
2185 2018-04-09 19:53:36 yeah that shit tastes so good. i put a ton of cinnamon and coconut oil, cuz they have good health benefits, and then i'll add in a scoop of whatever protein powder. and its really filling for awhile so i like it. its not insane in terms of carbs, but not good for you either lmao
2186 2018-04-09 19:53:32 but aloe vera & olive/argan oil is dat shit
2187 2018-04-09 19:53:27 Haven’t tried the cbd  oil but thanks for the tip. Where can I find dosing information?
2188 2018-04-09 19:53:18 10% of the world's total proven petroleum reserves are in Iran. They have nearly 100 years worth of oil in their reserves. Thought I'd point this out now.
2189 2018-04-09 19:52:35 Trump has major decisions and he’s business minded thankfully unlike bush 2 who was the worst with business owners the Texan rangers baseball team from oil money
2190 2018-04-09 19:52:25 I agree. For now we need to ship our oil and LNG. As it is, it stays in Alberta until it gets shipped to the states, who really don't want to give us a fair price. Still for the life of me don't understand why we don't refine it here.
2191 2018-04-09 19:52:07 How much one eventual rise in the oil prices will not hit China? Probably this is more vast and complex than we think
2192 2018-04-09 19:52:03 So WHY doesnt Alberta refine its own oil?
2193 2018-04-09 19:51:50 Great idea, i have rosehip oil xx
2194 2018-04-09 19:51:48 Ooh, quick question, my fryer currently takes 9l of oil. I want to use tallow, it's sold in 20kg packs. How much will I use in kg to make 9 litres??? 
2195 2018-04-09 19:51:32 It will also strip your natural oil (see: saving birds from oil spills) so tread lightly and do an oil-pack conditioner after if you need it.
2196 2018-04-09 19:51:31 @CatherineBizTV the same old liberal talking points!! Leads me to believe this was the plan all along, to idle the oil sands!!
2197 2018-04-09 19:51:27 Gotta do my hair today need a hot oil treatment
2198 2018-04-09 19:51:16 It's in America's Best Interests FIRST, then a handout to Canadians in splurts, irregardless of any ecological damage which may be done.America needs Huge Amounts of Oil to go to WAR. Screw the environment."It's Every Man (and Nation) Out For Itself.Goodbye Sweet Mother Nature!"
2199 2018-04-09 19:51:12 Came for another oil change let’s see how they try to juke me this time
2200 2018-04-09 19:51:08 I'm pretty sure it's just olive or vegetable oil with salt but I could def be wrong
2201 2018-04-09 19:51:01 I completely agree with you with that statement. More to it is the everything that is made of oil is already being made in environmentally safe ways. It's in these companies that have the permanent jobs.
2202 2018-04-09 19:50:58 You do understand a tax on carbon is to reduce the use of oil right? BC doesn't want more oil going through the coast so two different issues. The fact the carbon tax is not being put towards renewable energy and EVs is a different discussion.
2203 2018-04-09 19:50:57 Relocating from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION to JAKANDE LEKKI is a slow and steady drive

2206 2018-04-09 19:50:37 Pipelines leak. Alot. Oil companies lie about pipelines leaking, alot. So the question is; how good will their cleanup be? And if it's lacking, will they forced to pay to get it to where it needs to be?
2207 2018-04-09 19:50:35 If they buy his snake oil again they deserve everthing they get.
2208 2018-04-09 19:50:30 I just made the dopest lunch. Italian sausage and veggies baked with olive oil and spices served over rice. Yum!

2211 2018-04-09 19:50:18 (We might have to rent a penguin for appearances sake, and pour a bit of motor oil on it, so it looks like an Exon Valdez refugee.)
2212 2018-04-09 19:50:17 You smoking something dangerous. .. It will kill you...  Casper is not in that league. .. ha o mmatla bolela. . Don't mix water with oil
2213 2018-04-09 19:50:16 The problem is that oil companies prefer sending raw bitumen to far more competitive US refineries built with massive subsidies when oil price was high. Now oil price is low and the level of corporate welfare it would take to build refineries here is not going to be popular.
2214 2018-04-09 19:50:11 I HATE PUTTING OIL IN MY EAR AAAAA

2216 2018-04-09 19:49:56 But not the farmers, it’s like no oil drilling in Florida.
2217 2018-04-09 19:49:50 Make renewables viable and the oil stops flowing, simple.  Stopping oil before they're ready won't solve anything other than sending jobs/tax dollars to other countries.
2218 2018-04-09 19:49:46 If you are in favour of this project you are supporting a 40% increase in the oil sands. That is absolutely incompatible with lowering our carbon footprint.

The entire country is being forced to pay a carbon tax so that we in Alberta can keep expanding

Its selfish and reckless
2219 2018-04-09 19:49:43 BUT DONGHAE DROPPED TGE COOKING OIL LID IN WITH THE FOOD AND SHINDONG FOUND IT OHMH GOD
2220 2018-04-09 19:49:41 Made the mistake of enjoying a lunch crepe with truffle oil and now I can't get the smell out of my desk (and possibly my hair). I regret everything.
2221 2018-04-09 19:49:37 Honestly I’m in the mood to change some oil today & im not talking about on no car...
2222 2018-04-09 19:49:29 LOL?  Is this a joke to you?  Trump cabinet emptying US Treasury faster than tax breaks for billionaires!  Oil spills and pollution of land, water and air a joke?
2223 2018-04-09 19:49:23 Had time after my oil change and before my 2nf workout so I treated myself to a Starbucks

2231 2018-04-09 19:48:47 RT @AlbertaAltruist: A lot of focus in this pipeline debate is on Big Oil, Kinder Morgan, and the protests. The thousands of small businesses and their staff may not be able to continue while the heel dragging continues. #ableg #cdnpoli

2236 2018-04-09 19:48:26 Dré literally start over, I mean throw all the “black soap “ away and exfoliate every 2 to 3 days and use coconut oil as a moisturizer... this helped my skin, and not to sound like a broken record but WATER WATER WATER you have to keep your skin hydrated

2240 2018-04-09 19:48:01 Ya neh...being rich and dumb at the same time you know it's a case of mixing oil with water.
2241 2018-04-09 19:47:53 We are currently importing less than 1/3 of the oil we were importing in 2005.  At this point we are exerting more influence on oil than foreign sources are.
2242 2018-04-09 19:47:40 I agree totally with you. There is something changing the game. Did US want a different leadership in Syria from start? Get a deal on the resourses? What about Turkey and Nato.? ISIS Handed Over Euphrates East Bank, Oil Assets, to US that we know, but are they thirsty for more?
2243 2018-04-09 19:47:36 Put cling film into a mug, rub with olive oil. Crack the egg in and tie the clingfilm then put the bag in to the water
2244 2018-04-09 19:47:27 Have you even taken the time to see a reclaimed heavy oil site? I would say from your tweet the answer is no.
2245 2018-04-09 19:47:20 Serious question; how does blocking Alberta oil stop oil development? We’re not the only ones who try to sell it and even if the powers that be manage to keep AB oil in the ground, we’ll all just have to import from somewhere else; through your port. Win?
2246 2018-04-09 19:47:17 Yes. How about the ‘new world order’ with China and Russia the major powers? America is owned by China and due to ‘the blockade’ Qatar was forced into Russia’s open arms. Now partners in ROSNEFT. Plenty of oil.
2247 2018-04-09 19:47:07 Fear and discomfort!

2250 2018-04-09 19:46:57 People just don't realize that their comfortable lives are due in great part to the oil & gas industry, every aspect of their lives is made better by petroleum & petroleum products. Trouble is, they won't realize it until the supply is cut off. Guess we'll see.
2251 2018-04-09 19:46:49 We are great at shooting ourselves in the foot. #Trudeau is the laughing-stock of international leaders. We have the 2nd largest global oil reserves. O&G is the largest sector by 2 fold. & w/ record low oil prices,#YVR pays more than Europe for gas & getting worse! #kindermorgan
2252 2018-04-09 19:46:43 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
2253 2018-04-09 19:46:40 I'd think so ! Saudi shale oil drying up may make the blockade more difficult in the future for them to Qatar....
2254 2018-04-09 19:46:37 Or putting that another way maybe: Short oil position to capture contango $ for a portion of portfolio also works as a hedge when it will matter most.

2272 2018-04-09 19:45:08 "100% renewable energy by 2050" ... that's the plan. And if that's the plan, why in the world would anyone invest in development of Canadian oil and gas? Kinder Morgan has figured out (correctly) that they are not in the federal government's plan.
2273 2018-04-09 19:45:03 If there was oil in Syria we won't be having this conversation.
2274 2018-04-09 19:44:42 Audi costs a little bit more but it’s because it takes synthetic oil and i don’t need oil changes nearly as frequently. For peace of mind, if you don’t have an individual mechanic you trust, the dealer isn’t a bad option.

2294 2018-04-09 19:42:39 Sounds sweet but contains the same fallacy. As well as the one that trumpets Canada's "environmental standards" and at the tar sands no less, which have been cited by international bodies as well below par, while the idea we can't have a social safety net without oil is cynical.
2295 2018-04-09 19:42:38 Perhaps you should talk to @JustinTrudeau about the KM pipeline... All hands on deck means reducing ALL fossil fuels, not just coal. Leading the charge on coal is not hard, time to step up and deal with the powerful oil groups.
2296 2018-04-09 19:42:32 if you don't pay the taxes due you go to jail! nobody knows how the taxes are distributed across society only budgets..it can only be effected by change of government and policy and lots of standing up to corporate lobbyists and the shareholders of those oil companies

2320 2018-04-09 19:40:32 I’m going to create a 9 in 1 product. Shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, toothpaste, deodorant, motor oil, milk, something to get you a lil tipsy, and hand soap all in one bottle.

2322 2018-04-09 19:40:14 next time I go to the beauty supply store imma try getting that jamaican black castor oil shit. I’ll try it one time
2323 2018-04-09 19:40:14 No lie tho, once I make my own oil I’m giving up backwoods till I’m an old dyke, selling them on the pier.
2324 2018-04-09 19:40:11 Trying coconut oil and diatomaceous earth for natural non-toxic flee control on the cats, Cosmo didn't put up too much of a fight but didn't enjoy it, and now there's a grooming-fest going on, probably feels weird. Only applied it on the chin and neck areas.

2327 2018-04-09 19:39:34 I'd suggest not using real oil/grease.
2328 2018-04-09 19:39:32 U niggas will court and try to pet any set of legs with baby oil on them
2329 2018-04-09 19:39:04 Happy birthday to all of you Aires out there. This month will be an interesting one for you. Not only is the Sun's position in your sign but Uranus and Mercury are there too. This month will find you experimenting with ideas a lot. #keepajournalhandy. You might strike oil.

2331 2018-04-09 19:38:54 You’re full of shit, pipelines owned by kinder-Morgan average a spill a week. Even if they are minor spills, this is not the location to have even one drop. Unrefined bitumen oil does not float, it sinks and can not be cleaned 100%
2332 2018-04-09 19:38:52 OIL
2333 2018-04-09 19:38:45 How do you not notice:

Condos go up so does Homeless
ICE raids are successful now tomatoes are $2
CA Legalizes weed but kids are still doing time for smoking
Political Powers take heat for Sexual offenses & the Sex Industry crumbles.
Solar panels are a thing but we bomb for oil.
2334 2018-04-09 19:38:36 Eating soft bacon is like drinking bacon oil lmao
2335 2018-04-09 19:38:31 It's the paper-thin skin on those keyboard-soft fingers, dude. Go chop some wood or change your oil. Get some callouses! :-)
2336 2018-04-09 19:38:31 Because my buddies in Big Oil asked me to....
2337 2018-04-09 19:38:25 Also never taking my car back to @jiffylube in spring branch. I specifically asked to have my windshield wiper fluid replaced w/ my oil change(which they’re already supposed to do) &she said yes we’ll do that we always do! Took it to an auto shop today & found out they never did.
2338 2018-04-09 19:38:13 PSA: The fda tests none of this as long as it makes no medicinal claims (it can say what it contains, but not what it "does")! That is how snake oil companies get away with such a low bar. None of these products are tested as compounds themselves or for delivery efficacy.
2339 2018-04-09 19:38:07 Couldn't unlock my phone because there was olive oil on my thumb. But in actuality, that's how it should know it's me
2340 2018-04-09 19:37:46 If you hate on Turkish food, then you're tastebuds have long left you.

I'll take my donner that's just had a bath in olive oil please.
2341 2018-04-09 19:37:38 Put coconut oil in your hair from roots to ends. Put it up in a nice bun. Go to bed. Wake up shampoo it out. And you got some bomb ass soft hair. Thank me later.

2343 2018-04-09 19:37:21 @bcalmanac The oil industry is at the end of its life.There is no reason to build infrastructure for future use, especially when allowing the project will make it impossible for Canada to meet the Paris Agreement.We owe it to our children and the planet to not allow KM.
2344 2018-04-09 19:37:16 Of course everybody is at the dealership getting a service the day I wanna get my oil changed
2345 2018-04-09 19:37:14 ... So long as Americans won't discover that "oil" can be "extracted" from them? I, think?
2346 2018-04-09 19:36:56 I know that a fair number of BC residents work in the Oil Patch and Ft.Mac, I wonder if the BC gov't has factored that into any of their thinking and statements?
2347 2018-04-09 19:36:52 hope she does. And gives a reality check to all the dippers the life without oil. LOL #bcpoli
2348 2018-04-09 19:36:49 Does that mean more bombs on their way to #Syria ? how long will the thieves who have been looting and pillaging our economy and our ignorance rob us?
Oil will be done in a few years - this syria war is a waste of money and precious lives!
2349 2018-04-09 19:36:32 I try not to be too prescriptive as I would prefer people kind of go with their staples only at a higher magnitude if trying to protocol. Changing your current foods to eat different food for the experiment adds more confounders (with the exception of no coffee, MCT, coconut oil)
2350 2018-04-09 19:36:29 Electrical Officer - Edible Oil/FMCG (3-7 yrs) Rajasthan/Alwar (Electrical/Mechanical)...
2351 2018-04-09 19:36:29 Anne 53 of 53 first nations that are on the pipeline route have signed on with KM. So please stop using them as a crutch. Where is your protest of all the oil tankers that come into port through BC waters into Washington State? Or how about into the St. Lawrence?
2352 2018-04-09 19:36:27 Seriously, who are you going to trust? An astronaut or @realDonaldTrump ‘s snake oil salesmen Rick Scott?’ This isn’t hard.
2353 2018-04-09 19:36:27 I hope the Bush family got their belly’s full of revenge against SH. All of this for retaliation for 43 and Halliburton’s oil.
2354 2018-04-09 19:36:23 @ntvkenya Kindly share that story about avocado oil production in Western.
2355 2018-04-09 19:36:18 Nobody is against oil here, we're against expansion. People have little say in what  manufacturers use in their products, this is our way of saying find alternatives.
2356 2018-04-09 19:36:11 Mary "I just fell to my knees in Kwikfit."
You could have just tipped the fella for changing your oil love...  #CoronationStreet
2357 2018-04-09 19:36:02 Yea I’m down in broward so it’s the same. Tree is decriminalized but they’ll get your ass for oil
2358 2018-04-09 19:35:56 Except that CA was almost entirely selling snake oil and had a minimal role in the US election.
2359 2018-04-09 19:35:54 Kenya has oil...sooon
2360 2018-04-09 19:35:36 The government couldn't provide us "with alternative options" the alternatives were staring them in the face. You could always Google what the oil industry is doing to remain active in alternate energy sources. It's really quite interesting.
2361 2018-04-09 19:35:33 Matter of opinion- in my book it was more than enough judging by the the 22% approval rating as they left office in discrace a lot of other people felt the same way- and most of them don't even know about China and the oil corporations all over Iraqs oil
2362 2018-04-09 19:35:31 No shit. The same inspectors claimed that Sadam Hussein had no chemical weapons   The guys name was Scott Ritter. Bush destroyed Iraq for the oil companies  they want a pipeline to Europe need to go through Syria and Iraq
2363 2018-04-09 19:35:27 Psychic mediums are genuine con-men. They prey on mentally vulnerable people who are seeking answers and play into confirmation bias to convince con them that what their selling is real. Absolute snake oil salesmen
2364 2018-04-09 19:35:23 Buying oil from offshore suppliers instead of Alberta is going to change that?
2365 2018-04-09 19:35:13 My coconut oil is almost a liquid again #SummerIsHere
2366 2018-04-09 19:35:10 Also. Sidenote. Coconut Oil is not the best thing to use as lube. Don't ask me how I know this.
2367 2018-04-09 19:35:09 We are able to service all foreign and domestic makes and models from a routine oil change to a complete engine overhaul. We provide quality auto service for the customers. #SouthsideCustoms #NorthBrunswick #AutoRepair #AutoMaintenance

2370 2018-04-09 19:34:27 Put a (very) little olive oil and Greek seasoning on my cucumbers today, and I'm v happy with myself.
2371 2018-04-09 19:34:06 how much do yall pay for oil changes at the dealership? I drive a honda and I think my free oil change period is over.
2372 2018-04-09 19:33:56 India is supplying electricity 24 hours to villeges to reduce dependence on oil.
2373 2018-04-09 19:33:24 in the ph y'all can cook from all the oil on my face, but here in the uae i become so fucking crusty :)) wHEN WILL MY SKIN LOOK OKAY IS2G

2375 2018-04-09 19:33:08 One of my colleagues made the point that the whole issue should be reframed: 'we need a backup to our  50+ yr old pipelines, that have served us so well. We are vulnerable. Every sector depends on oil and existing pipelines need to be duplicated. A proven transport mode.'
2376 2018-04-09 19:33:08 Your oil isn't for domestic use.  We have always had to buy from Washington State.  The tiny refinery we do have, will lose it's contract with KM as it can't do high quantity runs.  They only want to export in high quantities.
2377 2018-04-09 19:32:40 Is this oil painting, do you know?
2378 2018-04-09 19:32:25 Hayibo  yerrr can’t you use coconut oil instead
2379 2018-04-09 19:32:12 “The Sumas pump station/terminal are located in Abbotsford. Both facilities route crude oil from the TMPL mainline into Washington State via KMC’s Puget Sound pipeline system. The terminal contains can handle volumes of approximately 715,000 barrels”. ...didn’t find BPD stats.
2380 2018-04-09 19:32:00 Finally getting my oil changed. Now I have to sit here for 45 mins.
2381 2018-04-09 19:31:51 Rih not goin gettin me with that shimmer oil cause i made my own and it was way lit.... 1 suggestion don’t wear it to the beach.. in still burnt from Bahamas
2382 2018-04-09 19:31:36 Their agenda is free gas and oil,  create Islamophobia and the middle east becomes Israel.
2383 2018-04-09 19:31:10 Mostly think oil will start to correlate strongly when a true world economic meltdown becomes apparent like in 2008.  Demand from businesses will drop too hard for oil price not to drop with it.
2384 2018-04-09 19:31:06 And now we have ISIS running around thanks to the illegal invasion (for oil + other classified material obtained |space related| )

2386 2018-04-09 19:30:57 Oil prices dropped by 70%? Why haven't they dropped by a considerable amount in Kenya?
2387 2018-04-09 19:30:46 Combine 4 tsps cereal with 9 tsps cupcakes. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve in 3 inch slices
2388 2018-04-09 19:30:44 Try building a factory in most states and see how far you get. Not one new oil refinery has been built in the last 30 some years and one of the existing ones is on the verge of bankruptcy due to government rules about ethanol blending they can no longer afford.
2389 2018-04-09 19:30:42 Like I said, I do not want retaliation on my car because I went above their heads. Last time I did they just gave the car back at me the next day with a massive oil leak saying it stopped having issues when it still had the same issues it started with as well.
2390 2018-04-09 19:30:36 That’s kinda impressive. Better than I can do.
2391 2018-04-09 19:30:35 Gather round, gentle folk! Come buy the Magic Mr.Jones' secret elixir! It cures all that ails you! Frogs gone gay? Cured! Trans-dimensional pedophilic vampires?? Be gone! Pesky minorities? Pacified! Buy my snake oil!!!
2392 2018-04-09 19:30:34 Going to go get an oil change 
2393 2018-04-09 19:30:33 There is no way to clean a huge oil spill up proper! It will destroy so much and for the benefit of a few people :( 
Our government needs  to start building the new clean green renewable energy infrastructure ! Canadians Jobs that will last and protect the environment !
2394 2018-04-09 19:30:31 Patt got me at Honda getting a oil. The guy instantly says “oh no, you’re here for much more than an oil change.” 
2395 2018-04-09 19:30:27 I like it tossed in garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper, a little parmesan and baked or grilled!
2396 2018-04-09 19:30:26 The unelected & detested, medieval saudi junta is in power only on the back of US arms and support.

This Sauds are just 'titular' owners of Aramco's oil since TE Lawrence's time (it was Standard Oil then).

They dont even fart without prior  permission
2397 2018-04-09 19:30:20 How much do you depend on your #car When was the last time you changed the oil?
2398 2018-04-09 19:30:11 Today is not my day. I’m covered in turbine oil so that’s cool.
2399 2018-04-09 19:30:09 If you led a country wouldn't you be doing everything in your power to not have to suck up to these Saudi's or any oil producing country?
2400 2018-04-09 19:30:08 The #MondayMotivaton for me today is simply multiple butt-biting deadlines. I did just take a 20-minute power nap, preparing for the inevitable midnight oil burn tonight. Feast or famine in #entrepreneurlife sometimes, so you gorge when the bounty presents itself.
2401 2018-04-09 19:30:04 Cooked in peanut oil?
2402 2018-04-09 19:30:01 Rather than saying Alberta will invest in Kinder Morgan I strongly suggest you invest in developing an effective means of dilbit (bitumen) cleanup as none currently exists. In fact when oil cleanup levels on water reach 15% it's considered to be a  success. Dilbit sinks.
2403 2018-04-09 19:29:45 TFW you try hard to sell snake oil that isn’t working. You do it because  you know you’re getting over 250k richer every year because of it.

2406 2018-04-09 19:29:07 Natural gas isn't all that clean, and fracking for it is even worse. Fracking is but an oil lobby way to impede a real shift to greener energy sources.
2407 2018-04-09 19:28:55 because the oil will move, pipeline or not, is your preference that it is moved by CO2 producing rail; by a mode of transportation far more susceptible to derailment with spills? Can we live with another Lac Megantic?
2408 2018-04-09 19:28:33 Does anyone have any info on #CBD oil? I think I'm going to start using it for my arthritis. I would love some feedback!

2412 2018-04-09 19:27:59 Yeah.. as long as you get their oil.
Since when, did butchering millions to steal their oil became 'legit'?
The world is yet to see any WMD from Iraq!
US is the world's biggest war criminal and the mother hub of all terrorism.
History'll not be that merciful to you.
2413 2018-04-09 19:27:51 Remember $19.99 +T/F conventional oil changes up to 5 quarts, Tuesday-Thursday. Appointments fill up fast call LUKE at MIDAS (847)455-0364
2414 2018-04-09 19:27:40 Hilarious.  BC gets most of its oil from Washington State.  BC Ferries has been switching to natural gas.  Alberta exports it's unrefined bitumen, that wasn't going to change.  Keep your dirty tar sands sludge.
2415 2018-04-09 19:27:39 Wish I would have known this 19 goddamn years ago, your cousin had a bottle of 30% capsaicin oil that he used to cook with. 

Would have saved me a lot of heartache.

2423 2018-04-09 19:25:57 That is what the Brits have tried to do elsewhere, but generally where there is oil to be had.

2426 2018-04-09 19:25:34 Like most left wing governments or opposition parties they’re afraid to embrace their core values. They yearn for acceptance of the right, playing right into their hands. Seemingly never learning a damn thing. Notley squandered a crash in oil prices, and a historic election win.
2427 2018-04-09 19:25:32 "Coastal First Nations" read that again for clarity. Then apply your broken logic again. Eagle Spirit doesn't have the support of Coast First Nations, they have stated their case loud and clear. No oil through their lands and waters.
2428 2018-04-09 19:25:23 They got 4500 soldiers killed so the oil companies that put them in power, and China who loaned the trillions for the invasion (that we will pay for) could do what they wanted in Iraq- anyone that can't see that doesn't want to

2433 2018-04-09 19:24:59 I think it’s an evil brew of emotion driven xenophiles and governments in hoc to oil interests allied to vain attempts at geopolitical control.
Concern for the common citizen doesn’t figure at all or is based on false premises.

2437 2018-04-09 19:24:31 If it was bad news why is the largest oil union cheering today?
2438 2018-04-09 19:24:25 I've seen numerous sources call him "life coach", "self-help guru", "motivational speaker"...so all those terms (in THIS case) are interchangeable & we all know what it means.  I can think of some other terms for Tony Robbins ...charlatan...grifter...snake oil salesman...con man
2439 2018-04-09 19:24:23 I’ve got baked chicken, steamed veggies, and sweet potato wedges (with like no oil!) for supper tonight- basically a salad but also like CHICKEN AND CHIPS!!! For me, it’s about tricking my brain 
2440 2018-04-09 19:24:23 They don't get it..the energy and oil guys want farms to fail so they can buy cheap land..real estate guys love it too.

2443 2018-04-09 19:23:52 Your know, the old Trust Me” statement from the snake oil salesman in chief.
I think our farmers are a lot smarter than he thinks they are to know when they’re getting a load of bs!
2444 2018-04-09 19:23:46 Is that a rhetorical question? Military correspondents know The US & UK have been building their military forces in the Mediterranean for months, in readiness to respond to this expected event! Syria has always been about restructure of the middle east and oil resource supplies!
2445 2018-04-09 19:23:29 You don't think economic conditions have a part to play in it? Or colonialism? Dictatorships etc? I'd disagree. It's the root problem. Nevermind that western governments are willing to support horrible regimes like saudis for oil. :/
2446 2018-04-09 19:23:24 They got their raise Betsy. They are still trying to get money for education of the students because the Republicans have taken it all away to cover other projects and allowed the oil companies to not pay their taxes.

2450 2018-04-09 19:23:12 It is NOT a civil war @AlanDersh IT IS NOT A CIVIL WAR. The Syrian people were mauled, raped and slaughtered by terrorists that @BarackObama and others paid with money, oil, weapons etc.
Its disgusting the criminality of the horrific Obama admin.
BHO will show as worst Prez ever!

2452 2018-04-09 19:23:03 Oil sales bro. Much of the borrowing is being done locally. We sell our oil & collect dollars into our reserve & then spend the naira. What we're mostly borrowing is naira via treasury bills and some foreign eurobonds (a mix of local and foreign to levering low foreign interest)
2453 2018-04-09 19:22:47 I told them you change ur oil and I don’t even know when my tires are done i need to get my shit together

And BTW, it's Coconut oil not the L word  f#ck is wrong with you
2471 2018-04-09 19:20:15 You cannot freeze the assets of Gazprom & Rosneft, as half of EU would be left without gas or oil.
2472 2018-04-09 19:20:14 America's regime change push in Syria is coming to a head. The end game involves Israeli expansion, balkanization, securing of oil reserves, establishing pipeline routes and the withdrawal of Russia and Iran.

Kinda like comparing the intellectual capacity of NASA to Andy Scheer or Doug Ford and claiming its a tie.
2489 2018-04-09 19:18:25 LOL That is a good 1. Alberta and it's resources mean nothing to him. The votes r in B.C. Ontario and Quebec all haters of oil that does not come from Saudi Arabia Nigeria or trained in from the Bakken. Another Lac Megantic won't lose him votes a pipe line expansion will.

2491 2018-04-09 19:18:14 Trump said as much during the debates - you create a power vacuum, it bites you in the ass. And if you HAVE to - "keep the oil." Y'know, so groups like ISIS can't seize wells and fund a vast terrorist empire. And gee whiz what are the Kurds sitting on right now? Oil fields!
2492 2018-04-09 19:18:11 Lol, I don't qualify for @AdvanceAuto oil change specials.

2502 2018-04-09 19:17:10 It’s just like a detox mask, pulls the shit out of your pores. You can mix with ACV but sensitive types should prob just use water. I put a few drops of tea tree oil w/ water in mine and that’s it

2508 2018-04-09 19:16:53 tankers using the Washington refinery are already close to 10X more that what's happening in Burnaby.  And they I have plans to increase that volume....  bc apparently doesn't want Alberta oil, so they'll get it from Washington that uses tankers to bring it in...makes sense
2509 2018-04-09 19:16:52 If we use the rest of the oil and gas reserves it probably is. So the question is, do we change while we can or destroy the world as we know it and let the surviving life forms wait it out a few 100000 year while the globe cools again. If it does. #SolarPower #globalwarming

2515 2018-04-09 19:16:14 I agree, but ignoring all data that counters this narrative is alarming. Even if you say those horrible Big Oil companies funded the opposition research, can we completely poo poo the data gathered? My take would lead me believe something between the two views. Debate is NOT over

2529 2018-04-09 19:14:19 Wheat can’t be shipped by pipeline that’s part of the reason oil should be. Because it can and it would likely be much more energy efficient. To the point about not just shipping raw materials though, I would like to see more infrastructure on the prairies to add value to grain.

2534 2018-04-09 19:13:19 @realDonaldTrump You do realize that our issues with China are stemming from fucking soybeans, and the whole reason we are still in the middle east has everything, still, to do with oil, right?

2560 2018-04-09 19:10:48 IMO BC residents have the most to lose and AB, the most to gain. The pipeline company and oil producers most of all.

Perhaps the pipeline company, Oil producers and AB should post a $5-10 billion bond to be used by BC in case the inevitable happens.

2565 2018-04-09 19:10:32 Which madman? All sides have gone mad. Take a big breathe and tell me who is in the right here? The US (and the UK) have played the middle East like a violin for a century. We like the chaos, it allows us to steal their wealth. Oil. Disaster capitalism. Colonialism.

2572 2018-04-09 19:09:40 Well we have tried going about it a certain way for a long time and this is what we have to resort to. Revolutions don't happen quietly homie. If our state hadn't put all of its eggs in the oil and gas basket then there would be more avenues.
2573 2018-04-09 19:09:31 We appreciate you letting us know, Rachel.

I bet farmers would like a wheat 'pipeline' to cut costs too.
2579 2018-04-09 19:09:06 That sounds like a lie that lots of people (shorts, competitors, dealers, oil industry, etc) want to believe
2580 2018-04-09 19:09:02 getting my oil changed and i have no idea if any of the things they r charging me for r legit but i do not care just fix the car i want to drive it
2581 2018-04-09 19:08:59 Throw in a Million Gallons of pure Snake Oil too. He'll go for that. He needs it to resell 
2582 2018-04-09 19:08:56 BC is in a much more advantageous position to block Alberta oil because you can just get it from somewhere else. Sure, that will still mean tankers in your port but your province won’t go without. BC has nothing to lose with this.
2583 2018-04-09 19:08:50 Go to Ft.MacMurray Alberta and tell them how u feel about oil, I dare u
2584 2018-04-09 19:08:40 If the oil industry is such a driver then it doesn't need those subsides from taxpayers does it?
2585 2018-04-09 19:08:26 Hell no. The Intel on Assad is fake! Just like they are trying to take Trump down, Deepstate is trying to get Assad out. Genie oil is waiting in the wings for overthrow. 
It is a terrorist faction that is using chemicals.

2586 2018-04-09 19:08:22 DSDP means Direct Swap Direct Purchase. This is done using the domestic allocation of Crude for settling internal petroleum products needs. However, since there is an "under recovery" factor, that deduction is made directly from Oil sold by NNPC, on behalf of Nigeria.

2590 2018-04-09 19:07:47 the people using the Borneo oil spill as ammo in their opposition to Kinder Morgan probably aren't going to tell you that the company responsible for the rusted pipe that burst is 

Government Owned and Maintained. 

Obviously, maintenance wasn't a high priority.  #cdnpoli
2591 2018-04-09 19:07:33 Took this quiz, it recommended a Mediterranean diet featuring fish and oil. Both are inflammatory. This is horribly misguided. What you eat, esp. for rheumatoid arthritis, does matter and should not include fish. Or dairy. Or eggs. Have you missed the research or ignoring?
2592 2018-04-09 19:07:33 Like the green left propping up the nationalists in scotland. Because nationalism has so often proven to be a positive force. (Lets not mention the oil)
2593 2018-04-09 19:07:17 Try tea tree oil
2594 2018-04-09 19:07:15 Wait, not to sound ignorant but what exactly is happening with the coconut oil 
2595 2018-04-09 19:07:03 let our money for oil taLk
2596 2018-04-09 19:06:57 That's IT! I'm covering us both in oil and we're going to wrestle this out.
2597 2018-04-09 19:06:50 Our farm system works just fine without it, always has. 
As a consumer we avoid buying anything with palm oil but it’s bloody hard!
Have to focus on what we can control, and that’s not being implicated in the industry by using PKE.

2602 2018-04-09 19:06:16 He kind of talks you through it on Episode 3 of Queer Eye but basically it's 
remove grapefruit skin and section into wedges, slice the avocado, dressing is 2 TBS olive oil 1 TBS acid (lemon juice), some Dijon mustard (tsp?), salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle over top. YUM.
2603 2018-04-09 19:06:14 Yeah .... that's what I'm saying ... that ... oil prices made projects economic ... not .. Harper's skill. In fact, his tactics actually cost oil and gas because he enlivened enviro and indigenous opposition by not following federal rules. I can go slower if you'd like.
2604 2018-04-09 19:06:01 I love having no oil in my heater, I've been recently saying how this spring is too warm

2609 2018-04-09 19:05:47 Yes you can. I have a highlighting loose powder that I mix it with a little Marula oil and it literally looks just like that body oil stuff

2612 2018-04-09 19:05:29 Just to give a sense of what Nigeria gets from a barrel of crude sold vs the amount of PMS we import. I didn't discuss the Crude swap or DSDP contracts, which involves a direct exchange of Oil for ONLY PMS delivered via NNPC.
2613 2018-04-09 19:05:28 @deszeppelin_  Any essential oil recommendations to add to mineral baths?  Also haven't forgotten about an oil diffuser for your room. 
2614 2018-04-09 19:05:23 Haha we were supposed to get paid from foreign oil companies to protest? That's a load of crap.
2615 2018-04-09 19:05:16 National economy? Sounds like the #VanRE folks have been hanging out with their AB buddies! Poor planning by the oil co's should not warrant strong arming another province. Too bad AB/oil co's didn't have a tiny bit of foresight & secured transport &/or refineries. BC's fault?

2618 2018-04-09 19:05:06 Cool thanks. I was considering trying out avocado oil. Plus right after I tweeted you I saw @AJA_Cortes just put out a video about good vs bad oils. Good stuff.

2622 2018-04-09 19:04:40 Phils have 10 fielding errors in 9 games. Kapler has asked all players to use Coconut oil to make their gloves more supple.
2623 2018-04-09 19:04:32 I would prefer that our products not be blockaded from getting to the consumer. If it didn’t cost so much to ship our oil East then maybe it would be more affordable for those refineries to work with it rather than importing oil.
2624 2018-04-09 19:04:10 Instead of fast tracking tarmacking this road, connecting Nairobi to the only oil producing region, you opt to dual Kiambu Road?
2625 2018-04-09 19:04:09 well with pc's and kenney's party yes. But with alberta ndp not so much bought but afraid of big oil and big oil funded media
2626 2018-04-09 19:03:59 Now i can say you’ve been successfully brainwashed by the very people who are informed to deny such science by their donors (specifically oil and gas companies). Odd that you say leftist use division when conservatives constantly use fear mongering to convince gullible people—-

2629 2018-04-09 19:03:50 Great! So you won't mind if Alberta shuts off the taps for oil and natural gas. Your cars and trains can run on rainbows.

2633 2018-04-09 19:03:40 Marula oil is also nice as a carrier, and I find it soaks in faster than coconut.
2634 2018-04-09 19:03:26 Was so good! I'm done with tuna packed in water - it stays dry and unedible no matter what I do. I'm hooked on this brand of tuna packed in oil!
2635 2018-04-09 19:03:25 And my point were, they won't have anyone to sell to because oil will be obsolete when the rest of the world uses #SolarPower
2636 2018-04-09 19:03:25 Market Close: Oil futures moved higher today, but for the most part not threatening new highs. A different picture is seen in physical markets, where some of the coastal areas are seeing some of the highest gasoline prices of 2018. #OOTT
2637 2018-04-09 19:03:23 It’s bc they top it off when u get ur oil changed! Hahaha I’ve only run out of it once in the last 8 years of driving

2639 2018-04-09 19:03:12 It gets scary to us in the lab because there are so many extremes happening,in our data, all at once. We so don’t want it to be a perfect storm. Truth is: Oil drilling and it’s products has to stop. They can’t accept industry cost.Till then..scary.

2645 2018-04-09 19:02:22 We need to offer European countries cheap clean Natural Gas and get them off Russian oil, if you take the Russian oil out of the equation Russia has no economic resources.

2650 2018-04-09 19:02:08 Did You Know? A single quart of motor oil, if disposed improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.
2651 2018-04-09 19:02:06 Rihanna is charging $60 for a sticky, glittery oil. She’s ripping her fans off. You can get the same result by mixing illuminator drops with your lotion. If not better.... Fenty Beauty is the most overrated, overhyped brand that’s come out in the last five years.

2665 2018-04-09 19:00:33 They think they are in control.:) It had topped 10 weeks ago  at 66.66 and no progress after that. It is costing them quite a penny to save it week after week.

2675 2018-04-09 18:59:44 Are you aware Canada is a net exporter of oil by about 400%.

The free market imports oil in one place and exports 4 times more in another because that is more profitable. 

 So do you want to nationalize the industry? No argument here.

2680 2018-04-09 18:59:07 BC doesn’t want pipeline. Well perhaps they shouldn’t get any oil as well. And Morgan pipeline doesn’t need taxpayers money. They need the climate change nitwits living off taxpayers to get the hell out of the way.  Trudeau as always ready to throw taxpayers under bus.

2692 2018-04-09 18:57:07 Well many of them have proof this theory to be very correct. Very unintelligent educated illiterates.
Talking about PMS as the only by product of a barrel of oil? Is like I'm in another planet. That's why I've to read the poorly sewn thread over and over again.
2693 2018-04-09 18:57:07 The hardship that allows letting refiners off the hook must be the same one that allows Big oil to spend $1million/day influencing people/gov’t.    I have a REAL challenge due to very low corn prices (could be much better if we just let RFS work as written) BUT I can still TWEET
2694 2018-04-09 18:57:02 Because the energy industry is dependent on Canada & it’s not the major driver of the economy. I hope BC gets its way. No pipelines, but no transfer payments, (who needs 6 billion), no Canadian oil. Those gas prices & Saudi oil will look great on you folks. #TurnOffTheTaps
2695 2018-04-09 18:56:58 Now think about how much money isis took selling oil in the beginning 
And the ppl who made it possible for them to takeover 

Does anyone really believe they did it for nothing

2699 2018-04-09 18:56:33 Perhaps Texas parents, teachers & kids will wake up & stop politicians from taking away school funding to give oil barons & CEO’s more tax breaks for another Gulf Stream or another ski vacation home to go with their Florida waterfront vaca place.

2710 2018-04-09 18:55:35 I mean Russia should be going to BB paper or so if there are huge bailouts, even on this oil price. And sure the bets gotta be taken somewhere (in many ways as you mention it already is) but to far far fewer.
2711 2018-04-09 18:55:31 No, just acrylic - I've never braved oil! But thanks.
2712 2018-04-09 18:55:29 What about rose hip oil?
2713 2018-04-09 18:55:27 The KM pipeline will be shipping crude oil to Asia not to the people of BC
2714 2018-04-09 18:55:25 Price reduction! We're passing the savings on to you. Oil lined TWAX pre-rolls are now $10 for half gram, and $15 for full gram!
2715 2018-04-09 18:55:09 bonus you can mix a few drops of oil in it for simultaneous... oiling
2716 2018-04-09 18:54:55 The oil companies aren’t gender neutral enough.
2717 2018-04-09 18:54:54 No amount of rhetorical nonsense from Trudeau & Carr or threats from Notley and Kenney will change the fact that there is no science for recovering spilled diluted oil sand bitumen in sea water. Being unable to respond is no “World Class” spill response.

2719 2018-04-09 18:54:50 The one on the right - is that oil? Very impressive!
2720 2018-04-09 18:54:46 Hahaha No more oil wells for the thieves,  Sai Baba 2019
2721 2018-04-09 18:54:37 Roast them with olive oil and lots of garlic 
2722 2018-04-09 18:54:24 His insistence that Saudi oil is clean speaks volumes as to his ignorance of everything involved in the oil industry.
2723 2018-04-09 18:54:16 Yeah but the thing is is that we have been wanting Syria for a looong time. It’s the last country on the list to conquer. For oil.
2724 2018-04-09 18:54:10 And KM should shut down the other pipeline as well because it is 60 years old and far more likely to fail then a new one! Then figure out how to get gas and oil to the Lower Mainland.
2725 2018-04-09 18:53:52 Jamaican oil.
Custer oil. 
Coconut oil.
Olive oil.

2726 2018-04-09 18:53:48 DT the economist? Does he expect people making 3rd world wages (worse than Walmart) to buy equal numbers of electronics or toys built in the US? There is a reason for trade deficits, he just has no idea. Does he want the Saudis to buy an equal amount of oil from the US? Ok, arms?
2727 2018-04-09 18:53:46 That man Wakefield has a lot to answer for...and now he is selling his snake oil in the USA and getting idiots falling in behind him. Why are people so gullible?
2728 2018-04-09 18:53:40 Let me tell you. Our heart is bleeding. I see the park in my neighbourhood getting ready for the pipeline. Water park, pool, the trails in the wood. 
Yes votes count but this is about comon sense vs money & pollution.
To top it off we buy our oil from the US at top price.
2729 2018-04-09 18:53:39 The oil is in a #pipeline. Pipelines have been functioning for decades. You've been using products derived from #oil since day you were born. Google product list.
2730 2018-04-09 18:53:37 I do and you have them. You can't touch me unless you spray yourself with tea tree oil.
2731 2018-04-09 18:53:28 We use a special vegetable dye I get at a Greek grocery.  Stained my fingers temporarily red, too, while rubbing with olive oil for a nice shine! #HappyEaster
2732 2018-04-09 18:53:13 that's the option for sure but not for the lvl of oil i have rn on my head
2733 2018-04-09 18:53:08 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
2734 2018-04-09 18:53:06 Lots of industries grow quickly before they die. It’s kind of like a cancer cell. Cancer cells grow and grow and grow and they grow fastest right before the host organism dies. The host organism in this analogy is the earth, and the cancer is Oil & Gas
2735 2018-04-09 18:52:48 Oil production is at record high levels and two pipelines are under construction and two more have been approved. 

How much is enough?
2736 2018-04-09 18:52:30 And so oil will continue to be transported to BC by rail and transport trucks from the East coast. BRILLIANT
2737 2018-04-09 18:52:29 I'm so sorry!! If you don't mind me making some suggestions based on where I work: 
Extra magnesium supplements can help nerve damage
You can get magnesium oil to apply topically also
And tumeric can help, it's a strong anti-inflammatory herb that's a strong antioxidant
2738 2018-04-09 18:52:25 GOP desperately seeking to nullify Trump's awesome shit-Midas abilities. Keep Trump from pulling out the rug under all those Repub farmers, get them to vote this fall instead of receding into apathy & depression over trade war. Coming up? Trump's oil war. Farmers gonna love that.
2739 2018-04-09 18:52:23 If I recall correctly - greens, beans, grains, fruit, veggies, occasionally meat to flavor a dish, olive oil, and, of course, community gathering first and foremost.  No burgers & fries.

2741 2018-04-09 18:52:09 more public money for big oil. Rachel you are letting all Canadians down!
2742 2018-04-09 18:52:05 Oil is a finite resource. And the more we continue to burn it the less we have. As we continue to burn it, it will make the planet uninhabitable for several reasons. And you can’t have an infinite economic growth from a finite resource. It’s mathematics. And it doesn’t work.
2743 2018-04-09 18:51:50 For squared to target two-handed pistol stance, a pro once told me "grip with your toes - sounds kinda silly but it works to keep people off their heels".
2744 2018-04-09 18:51:48 At least you aren't that foolish to try cooking and burn your finger with boiling sunflower oil. STILL RECOVERING... I need a therapyst
2745 2018-04-09 18:51:43 I forgot to put  my coconut oil on face face again! 
2746 2018-04-09 18:51:33 Reality Check: You live in a war zone, your government has all but declared war on your number one supplier of oil, your country has no reserves to speak of and the we're heading into a mini ice-age.
2747 2018-04-09 18:51:27 .@ChuckGrassley now on Pruiit's case:  “appears EPA granted a secret waiver that is legally reserved for small refiners to one of the largest oil refining companies in the country," to avoid obligations of renewable fuel std.
2748 2018-04-09 18:51:27 Fam company, they had to change the oil because it’s was unhealthy
2749 2018-04-09 18:51:12 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
2750 2018-04-09 18:51:06 "Because my engine requires it. Without oil my engine and gears would simply get stuck, stop moving or overheat which could end up in fatal damage if not leading to a blasting self-destruction. Yes, Iowa-chan's an all American made Battleship! And quite proud of it!"
2751 2018-04-09 18:51:03 Take action against themselves for doing yet another chemical attack to make yet another excuse for the illegal war they are in as an excuse to kill Assad & steal the oil like Iraq?

2754 2018-04-09 18:50:48 Now, the armchair economist in me would say the BEST option would be to pump all those dollars into the currency reserve fund in very public fashion, like say, "$10 billion in oil profits being added to the currency reserve fund!" +prosecute regime offiials who abused the banks
2755 2018-04-09 18:50:47 @BNN should do a poll would Canadians like to see oil moved by #rail or by #pipeline which is safer and more secure

2757 2018-04-09 18:50:43 I used the oil & the grease for thicker hair & they have one for anti itch I used that one too. & for my natural hair they have this leave in straightener it’s super light.
2758 2018-04-09 18:50:43 As usual @Tzeporah leaves out lots of the info to suit her agenda. What are all you hypocrites doing about all the other LNG and oil mega projects being built around the world? @JustinTrudeau probably time you do something other than PR photo ops and lip service
2759 2018-04-09 18:50:41 i meant to buy this numbing oil i seen before my next sugar appt and completely forgot  it was sketch to me anyway.
2760 2018-04-09 18:50:29 one of the sales ladies in my office has been on the phone shouting about cannibis oil and getting “medical” marijuana under the table literally since 9 AM and no one is batting an eye??
2761 2018-04-09 18:50:28 i feel u girl i’m currently dousing myself in coconut oil and desperately conditioning
2762 2018-04-09 18:50:28 Question:  If the U.S. is producing more oil and becoming a major oil producer and exporter, why are gas prices rising? We need to get out of OPEC.    @SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump
2763 2018-04-09 18:50:28 There's a strong smell of burning oil around Blackmores Path area if Lynton ... anyone's fire or boiler not worked big properly?
2764 2018-04-09 18:50:25 So I’ve ran out of oil 
2765 2018-04-09 18:50:16 The leaders of Muslim countries are far more concerned about money and oil then actually helping their own people. Sad but harsh reality
2766 2018-04-09 18:50:10 @ThomasRhett my oil delivery for an almost empty tank - cost less then two tickets & VIPs...... -  good thing you're worth it 
2767 2018-04-09 18:50:02 Thank you.  Genetics and Tea Tree Oil...lol.
2768 2018-04-09 18:49:45 Not long ago there were news that even Saudi-Arabia is planning a billion dollar solar energy plant, and they don't need to(yet). But they know that oil don't last forever so they probably plan to shut production down while some is still in reserve. #RenewableEnergy #SolarPower
2769 2018-04-09 18:49:26 Globe and Mail reports BC will now build up its own oil infrastructure, leaving Alberta in the cold.
2770 2018-04-09 18:49:26 Can anyone imagine what late 20th century would have been like if there was a pan-Arab Nation that spanned MENA, controlled much of the world's oil reserves, and was allied with the USSR and the Communist bloc? The oil embargo of the 70s would have been a walk in the park.
2771 2018-04-09 18:49:25 Maybe it's best we didn't get an independent Scotland. We would have had all the natural resources and the nukes.   And we know what happened to the last country who had oil & weapons of mass destruction.

2776 2018-04-09 18:48:54 Homeless? Lol. We need to diversify our economy. That's why Alberta crashed so hard. What did oil companies do when that happened? Shut down!
Why isn't Alberta getting rafineries to sell our ressource to us rather then china?
Why do I need to pay their carbon tax?
2777 2018-04-09 18:48:51 The oil and gas sold to BC schould have been stopped 6 months ago and all BC products boycotted
2778 2018-04-09 18:48:45 Relationship management with an adversary is a delicate balance. You push Putin by dropping the price of oil and stealing his gas customers, pushing EU to defend itself, boosting defense. Then you horse trade
2779 2018-04-09 18:48:43 I had to stop eating both garlic and onion for a few months to see if they were triggering my tum and I didn’t miss them nearly as much as I thought? Although garlic infused oil was the real MVP
2780 2018-04-09 18:48:31 Notley shouldn't have to do anything.  It's federal jurisdiction, having provinces battle is silly.  on a funny note Believe Bc produces 60 mb/d and uses 120 mb/d  Guess they'll make up difference by importing from washington... How do they get oil in.....tankers
2781 2018-04-09 18:48:25 Who are you calling enemies here? People who want Canada to join other countries on the planet in evolving to stop destroying the ecosystem of earth? Who is enemy here & enemy to what? Enemy to Texas oil cartels yes. Enemy to Canada, land, water, people & future generations? No.
2782 2018-04-09 18:48:17 A lot of these wars are not about oil and money  or nationality but what lies beneath the surface . 

Religion/Spirituality 
&& hidden secrets and history .
2783 2018-04-09 18:48:05 BC was investigating whether they could control/restrict oil tanker shipments
2784 2018-04-09 18:48:02 Oil fracking is just a douche for the earth #apgov
2785 2018-04-09 18:48:00 Like throwing a hot dog down a oil well
2786 2018-04-09 18:47:53 Bullshit! How about the billions of litres of raw sewage BC has been dumping in the Pacific ocean for many, many decades? That is not Fake News. Fix that despicable problem & you might earn some social license to criticize the oil industry.#TransMountainPipeline
2787 2018-04-09 18:47:46 You big headed, coal feet burning snake oil salesman. You're just bummed you got called out
2788 2018-04-09 18:47:42 To be fair to her they ain't exactly oil paintings either. She must really like sausage because four sounds exhausting to me aha.
2789 2018-04-09 18:47:39 I am no fan of Assad, but why would he use now, he has control of most of the towns, and rebels were on the run. This is a desperate and evil act by the rebels supported by Saudis and Israel, to get US involved and grab the oil fields. Saudi $1.2b to Kushners
2790 2018-04-09 18:47:31 Super .. this from the same TNPCB which watched people clear oil spillage in buckets for weeks ????
2791 2018-04-09 18:47:29 It's threats, that oil trade isn't as important as one thinks. Otherwise they would have done something already. Pushing the public to support it but still having Iraq and Afghanistan fresh on the mind as a waste, it's harder to persuade. Ukraine was more important to Russia.
2792 2018-04-09 18:47:17 ... Traveling gluten free: cross contamination is a killer, especially fried potatoes (they cook everything else in that pot of oil)...
2793 2018-04-09 18:47:15 Considering body lava but I don’t think it’ll top my TF shimmer oil...
2794 2018-04-09 18:46:58 Thank you so much beautiful! Great advice! I’ve got peppermint oil & will get the charcoal in case it happens again. Terrified of it coming back!
2795 2018-04-09 18:46:51 The UAE is world-renowned for many things: its immense oil riches, the bright lights and sky-high buildings of Dubai,...

2799 2018-04-09 18:46:39 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2800 2018-04-09 18:46:37 I can’t find the tweet but someone said Shuri put Bucky on coconut oil to make his hair look like that in the iw trailer and I am in tears
2801 2018-04-09 18:46:35 How I would change America Part 1

1. Metric System, today

Don’t worry, if we can learn modern video games, photo editing, oil pulling, face contouring, mumble rap, and the new Snapchat, we’ll learn the metric system too.

We got this.

What would you improve?
2802 2018-04-09 18:46:24 If the Prime minister is saying an oil pipeline is in the National interest, why didn’t he treat Energy East with the same importance
2803 2018-04-09 18:46:07 really I have seen online whole kit for beards so many products gel, well, hell, cream, wax, oil, shampoo, what not 
2804 2018-04-09 18:46:06 Where I'm from in Wisconsin, we had science textbooks from the 70s until about 2003. It predicted earth would be out of oil by the year 2000.
2805 2018-04-09 18:46:02 Holiness is to be found in the details:
The little detail that wine was running out at a party.
...that one sheep was missing.
...of noticing the widow who offered her two small coins.
...of having spare oil for the lamps, should the bridegroom delay.
etc.

2807 2018-04-09 18:45:56 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2808 2018-04-09 18:45:51 An expat in the UK and travel to Germany often I’ve seen the dramatic changing landscape here w/ massive land and sea structures tap into wind, solar, water and waste for energy - all with their own costs. Energy is a messy business. Maybe stop making oil look like the bad guy?
2809 2018-04-09 18:45:30 Oil futures recoup about half of last week's losses
2810 2018-04-09 18:45:29 Darn the luck. I need to get over and see you so I can be your oil guy. 
2811 2018-04-09 18:45:23 the smell of coconut oil is magical

You're drinking engine oil because?
Oh wait...you're a battleship,I forgot."
2813 2018-04-09 18:45:13 Whaaaaat?? the OIL guys.....?
2814 2018-04-09 18:45:10 So that she'll invade their backyard for the oil
2815 2018-04-09 18:45:07 Surrounded yourself with anti oil people?? I don’t get you. What did you expect?
2816 2018-04-09 18:44:57 My oil pen was worth every penny  > 
2817 2018-04-09 18:44:57 They really can't wait to invade Syria like. Obviously nothing to do with oil. Not like Rupert Murdoch and co own an oil company out there.
2818 2018-04-09 18:44:52 "Iowa-chan just can! Oil keeps the engine working, candy keeps my motivation high!" The American's attitude surely was a result of her heavy sugar abuse. "I couldn't even get 'nough of them~!"
2819 2018-04-09 18:44:21 I can pay for oil in any currency I choose. That's what FX markets are for. The only thing that matters is that the USD will always be a reserve currency as long as other countries sell more to the US than they buy. Period. Everything else is fluff and nonsense.
2820 2018-04-09 18:44:05 ‘Daddy Christmas’ is killing me bro, but I wasn’t using anything I only copped some beard oil like last week so I’ll tell you if it works well, but as for now like just let it grow bro don’t trim it or anything when you’re getting haircut, that’s what I did

2833 2018-04-09 18:43:01 Republicans are like the snake oil salesman Professor Marvel in the Wizard of Oz. They claim to be fiscally conservative but when you look behind the curtain, it's smoke, mirrors, and a lot of bluster.
2834 2018-04-09 18:42:41 True. But #palmoil can sometimes extract a terrible price, a price that consumers & users do not have to pay for other vegetable oils. I don’t think #sunflower oil ever harmed an #orangutan.
2835 2018-04-09 18:42:38 Hey @Starburst I love you but why you gotta do the orangutans dirty and use palm oil?

2841 2018-04-09 18:42:08 @GarethJBond thing that frustrates me with pub grub is the healthy option is often a 900 calorie ceaser salad with loads of oil and cheese

2847 2018-04-09 18:41:45 WHY DO ALL HAIR PRODUCTS HAVE COCONUT OIL IN THEM NOW 
2848 2018-04-09 18:41:28 It's just baby oil and makeup lol
2849 2018-04-09 18:41:27 & NO 1 talks about the pipeline #Russia want$ to build going THROUGH Syria. Countries DON'T want corrupt oil companies in their country-who could blame them?& so this shows what happens when 1 refuses to work w/fossil fuel giants- TERRORISM-FORCE-WAR-MASS MURDER of civilians
2850 2018-04-09 18:41:23 Tires? Rotated.
Oil? Changed.
Parental permission? No.

2851 2018-04-09 18:41:22 But if you buy a new car you won’t need to get an oil change!
2852 2018-04-09 18:41:18 Coconut oil does wonders for your hair
2853 2018-04-09 18:41:09 However, just 2 mill bbl per day can qualify for WTI crude oil. All other grades sell at significant discount to WTI and are in my definition not crude oil. Shale is producing the wrong barrels.
2854 2018-04-09 18:41:01 The bosses want to keep a marketable IP as-is. They pay Azaria a lot and want their money’s worth. That’s what made this decision.
2855 2018-04-09 18:40:57 Mate just ordered a pint of neck oil and even though I know it's a beer I still shuddered.
2856 2018-04-09 18:40:56 It's 90% of it. That of coarse split into the oil trade and the other half being perpetual war. Others, like Israel, have different interests. But as for Russia and America... That's about it.
2857 2018-04-09 18:40:46 Royal Dutch Shell paid a total of $4,322,742,582 (about N1.5 trillion) to the Nigerian government in 2017, according to its annual reports. 

Nigeria earned a total revenue of N10.6 trillion in 2017 from both oil and non-oil sources according to CBN Economic Report.

2868 2018-04-09 18:39:47 plus not all palm oil is bad... Just the kind that is exported and used in processed foods. The stuff used in countries that culturally use it, use the good stuff that hasn't been modified and is much healthier... But yah screw that guy and trying to shame your food choices

2871 2018-04-09 18:39:34 We kill innocent people in the Middle East, we destroy homes and families, we instal puppet leaders to support this oil addiction, and this leads to nothing but radical extremism! How are we pissed at terrorist that we created?
2872 2018-04-09 18:39:33 The oil industry has been gettin help from the government for years,  ethanol is left to stand alone, and even get held back by incorrect data that the EPA will not fix.  If you want to mess with ethanol, lets level the playing field.
2873 2018-04-09 18:39:29 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part lemon juice and 1 part mayonnaise. Add paprika and brown sugar to taste.
2874 2018-04-09 18:39:28 A pipe line so we can ship or $42 a barrel oil and  Buy $62 barrel oil makes sense  with  are   Desired valued Canadian peso

2876 2018-04-09 18:39:21 I rebuke this in Jesus name of Jamaican castor oil
2877 2018-04-09 18:39:17 Hey Lauren, thanks for sharing this. We hope to not see you go! We are happy to let you know that we stopped using palm oil in our Quest Bars beginning November last year. So any Quest Bars that were produced since then don't contain it.
2878 2018-04-09 18:39:10 BC doesn’t want dirty tar sand oil polluting our pristine coastline.
2879 2018-04-09 18:39:03 Thanks for the clarification. And, we don't export oil.  We export unrefined bitumen and dilbit. We should be leaving it in the ground or only dig up what we need and refine it here. Over 3 billion in annual subsidies for the Canadian Oil Industry. Let's put that $ to better use.
2880 2018-04-09 18:38:59 Poor instruction.
2881 2018-04-09 18:38:47 You really just mentioned susuki and gore?! 2 of the biggest hypocrites out there! It’s nice that you had a great career, with a gold plated pension, on the back of taxpayers money, from an oil based economy. No wonder you don’t give a !
2882 2018-04-09 18:38:42 the funds to the states education budget for more than a decade in order to attract more oil companies.
Too bad the oil companies don't want to relocate there bc the executives want better schools for their employees.
2883 2018-04-09 18:38:37 I'm not sure i believe you oil painting people btw.
2884 2018-04-09 18:38:32 @DaveKeto if no MCT or coconut oil what sources of fat do you use? Can u please give examples of meals? Tks Dave...
2885 2018-04-09 18:38:31 Tfw you realize you got the organic peanut butter instead of the super processed kind and you open the jar and the oil has completely separated from the peanut butter and it's spilling out everywhere and your hands and kitchen are covered in oil and you can't mix it back in

2890 2018-04-09 18:37:59 What do you expect?  This is a socialist dictatorship in a country that was once well off from oil revenue and has been destroyed by socialists.  So go there and vaccinate these children.
2891 2018-04-09 18:37:56 I’m Im not a Floridian, but the NRA and Big Oil has him by the dick.
2892 2018-04-09 18:37:53 $oil up nicely today +2.35% 63.52 maybe some bs numbers from EIA this week to slow it down? $oil $stocks $dnr $chk
2893 2018-04-09 18:37:49 I'm about 500 yards from Lucas Oil Stadium right now - hysterical that they have pictures of two players on the front of the stadium, one of who gained all his fame with New England @Patriots
2894 2018-04-09 18:37:47 no "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil", no "canola" (rapeseed) oil, no "high fructose corn syrup". and watch those food "dyes", they are more than just color.
2895 2018-04-09 18:37:46 Oil filter for me says CX?
2896 2018-04-09 18:37:44 perhaps we can wean off sooner.  I wrote a letter once as a disgruntled farmer with the oil patch.  I got a personal hand written explanation back.  We have that again at the moment.  Need to diversify however voters are in other provinces. Trudeau needs to put that aside and ..
2897 2018-04-09 18:37:42 @AlbertaatNoon  There are 5 large oil refineries in Washington State with the largest 2 (BP Cherry Point near Blain and Shell Anacortes) within 50kms of the border. Ironic that BC is willing to purchase about 50,000 bopd from these US facilities yet don't want their own.
2898 2018-04-09 18:37:40 Snake Oil Idiots
2899 2018-04-09 18:37:28 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2900 2018-04-09 18:37:12 Louisville oil spill was sooooo fat last year
2901 2018-04-09 18:37:06 What Iraq got after 15 years of removal of Saddam? 

Democracy? Bright future? Equal rights? 

And then you are offering the same dreams to Syria, why?? 

Can't you just live with the Oil in The US?

@POTUS @POTUS44 @GeorgeHWBush

2903 2018-04-09 18:36:55 Need to get someone's son to apply olive oil on my tits daily
2904 2018-04-09 18:36:53 Syria war summary: Everybody is saying we are fighting for citizens of Syria but fact is Millions of people  are displaced or killed so that foreign countries could get free/cheap oil.
2905 2018-04-09 18:36:52 I'm guessing that Ohio State hasn't done one, because everyone there know Urban is a snake oil salesman. He is so greasy, that Saban chastises his recruitment.

2910 2018-04-09 18:36:24 Canada doesn't have a problem yet Canadians are the ones suffering. No other country keeps their oil in the ground. No other country allows protesters the upper hand. Oil is here to stay but were the ones getting f*cked over.
2911 2018-04-09 18:36:03 Maybe the Kurds, like the Palestinians, feel they have a legitimate claim to the land but the Turks don’t want them to have it because of the oil reserves... Always two sides to a story, aren’t there?
2912 2018-04-09 18:36:03 A lad i knew had an XS400, the threads were stripped on the sump plug co here put it in with Araldite, To change the oil he used to take off the oil filter and start it, When the oil stopped squirting out he would stop the engine 
2913 2018-04-09 18:36:00 The question is... have @Total adequately prepared the ground for their own transition..?  I have a feeling many oil co's have simply left it too late to pivot their strategies to cope with a rapid energy transition
2914 2018-04-09 18:35:59 .@EPAScottPruitt, After all the hardship waivers for big oil, we, the biofuels industry will still be here with our 400,000 American jobs.  Moving forward, with or without you and @realDonaldTrump.

2918 2018-04-09 18:35:11 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2919 2018-04-09 18:35:10 And until then, I'd rather get oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia or Iraq where there's almost NO standards.

2922 2018-04-09 18:34:59 @SatiarShah @jawnjang Oh man I am the stay at home dad I got injured badly working in the oil patch so I was gone all the time. So I absolutely love being home but good lord this is the toughest job I've ever had. Whoa. Haha.
2923 2018-04-09 18:34:41 This just about the Middle East Pipeline that needs to pass by Syria and Russia is trying so hard to have control of oil in Europe. You’re all being played. Time to let go of these issues that doesn’t affect Americans. Bottomline, oil and money. Next issue please.
2924 2018-04-09 18:34:38 Lemon, olive oil and sesame oil x

Bend the knee you oil money plastic cunts!
2930 2018-04-09 18:34:14 @Costco  very poor customer service at Oshawa location. I went to automotive department for oil change. Department manger is misleading people. When I complained to management he didn’t like it . Then he told me after hour of waiting that my van has some filter issues.
2931 2018-04-09 18:34:06 You sure are! And despite what you've been convinced, u'r doing it to the detrement of Canadians. If you stop and think, u'll realize that we're better off upgrading and refining the product domestically.
Of course, the CDN oil co's u'r slurping on don't see it that way.
2932 2018-04-09 18:34:06 Veggie tots surprisingly good - a little pan frying in olive oil after out of oven helps

2934 2018-04-09 18:33:57 Just bought the oil and filter for the first change on the new scoot, plus rear brake pads. All together, it cost Ouch dollars. #ThereGoesTheTaxRefund
2935 2018-04-09 18:33:54 Former cattleman. Former landman.  Would really love to get off of oil in a more inviromently friendly environment. Its hard living with oil however at the moment a necessity. Need to keep it healthy and the country needs oil and if we keep it internal and a healthy economy...
2936 2018-04-09 18:33:52 not street tune, but tune up as in spark plugs, wires, ignition coils, filters, oil etc yeah
2937 2018-04-09 18:33:51 I need an oil change :(
2938 2018-04-09 18:33:51 Harding is often considered the most corrupt president, with his biggest scandal being Teapot Dome, when he sold the naval oil reserves to his friends in the oil industry. Trump has a Teapot Dome-sized scandal about once a week.
2939 2018-04-09 18:33:48 Niles, that just sounds like oil wrestling. I don't think I'm ready for that.
2940 2018-04-09 18:33:47 Earlier, @Lee_Saks  was like whack this mofo man.  

And I did. And $CL_F dropped to 63.25. Lee is an Oil god. He is an honorary Arab.
2941 2018-04-09 18:33:40 As long as you use oil it will be produced. STOP using oil products now!
2942 2018-04-09 18:33:39 Hey there, when I was studying for exams.... many years ago now someone recommended me an essential oil for concentration and it worked really well. Can't remember which one it was though do you know?
2943 2018-04-09 18:33:25 Albertans want to trade the future of Bc’s coast for short-term profits for a Texan oil company. You’re deluded and insane.
2944 2018-04-09 18:33:20 Graham is about as credible as any other carnival barker or snake oil salesman fleecing the rubes. White trash in a bespoke suit.
2945 2018-04-09 18:33:14 I am I full support of this. I've had some serious words with him before and it's already escalated higher up so I don't think he did himself any favours by adding this oil to the fire.

Our work prides itself on equal opportunities and doesn't stand for this.

2947 2018-04-09 18:33:09 Actually in the US the oil and gas industry (and nuclear) get far more subsidies than any green power source, and they are still frequently underpriced by renewables. Coal can't compete with anything on price now. My power company offers 100% renewable plans for <10% difference
2948 2018-04-09 18:33:08 CUT EDUCATION BUDGET SO RELYING ON GAMBLING PROFITS TO FUND SCHOOLS ALONE....MADE A JOKE OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, SIDED WITH UTILITIES TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS PAY INVESTMENT FOR NUKE PLANT WITHOUT REFUNDS CIRCUMVENTING INVESTMENT BONDS ON WALL STREET, WILL ALLOW OIL DRILLING

2951 2018-04-09 18:32:43 Buddy that’s all the oil sands is. A clean up effort. This shit is seeping out of the ground. Alberta is cleaning natures oil spill. Nature put it there not man. We are cleaning up the mess. Social justification enough for you?
2952 2018-04-09 18:32:37 Oil me up, daddy
2953 2018-04-09 18:32:32 Egyptian Magic!! Get it on amazon or Whole Foods!!! It’s more of an solid oil but I love it!
2954 2018-04-09 18:32:30 Your toiletless 3rd world country still like that oil money. If you think you are that superior, then Why you indians come to Qatar for opportunities?
2955 2018-04-09 18:32:24 WHO DECIDED TOUCHSCREENS WERE A GOOD IDEA FOR CARS
2956 2018-04-09 18:32:22 Loved the added feature of the oil inspection porthole. You could make sure the oil emulsified nicely..
2957 2018-04-09 18:32:15 #basicartistunite today was the release of the patent pending Carbon Odorless Relaxer with Blackseed Oil. Class is definitely in session @basichaircare #basichair #corelaxer
2958 2018-04-09 18:32:06 Maybe the turks just want the US to not arm the kurds and replace the population of northern Syria with the armed rebels that keep fighting Turkey for the last 50 years in order to hijack the oil through their new, toxic puppet state?
2959 2018-04-09 18:31:57 Ooooh I love to oil Brooke’s hot body all up and take her real good
2960 2018-04-09 18:31:21 @EnergyInDepth you guys represent the oil companies that are destroying our country
2961 2018-04-09 18:31:12 Only if we want to grab some oil, be America's bitch and increase out target profile for terrorists as we bomb innocent civilians.
2962 2018-04-09 18:31:11 Folks when selecting snake oil you've GOT to find someone trustworthy.
2963 2018-04-09 18:31:07 He prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies. He amounts my head with oil. My cup runs over 
2964 2018-04-09 18:30:52 Or, Mr. Strawman, instead, let's break our dependency on oil.
2965 2018-04-09 18:30:51 @PMOIndia Jab cruid oil ka price down hota hai to next day hi tax increase or dete ho. Aur jab aaj cruid oil ka price daybyday increase ho RHA hai to soch main ho Kam kare ya nai... Wha see Modi Sarkar... Sabka sath aur keval apna vikas

2974 2018-04-09 18:29:54 BS. The price of oil tanked. Not everyone in Canada wants your stinking tar leaks in their provincial parks and on native land. They can go rape a 3rd world nation of their resources, where they can buy politicians and not clean up after. Move on.

2976 2018-04-09 18:29:30 La Scala in Little Italy in Baltimore has the best olive oil that they import from Italy. Available for purchase.
2977 2018-04-09 18:29:24 Just let them have their oil fields, rat lines or whatever the hell &  we just focus on free clean zero point energy

2980 2018-04-09 18:29:11 the most unsurprising canadian politics heel move is the ab ndp & federal liberals abandoning reconciliation the second oil is involved

2982 2018-04-09 18:28:16 Also, screw you @AcadianWolfe if you think only Albertans should be weighing in on whether we should continue burning all the oil in the fucking Tar Sands. It affects all of us.

2985 2018-04-09 18:27:12 I love tinned beans & sausage. I had some pre-made fresh fish cakes and salad set aside. We just dunked them in the dressing, or in my case some garlic olive oil.
2986 2018-04-09 18:27:07 Anointing oil was always brought out in one of the churches I grew up in! So I mean kinda normal lmao
2987 2018-04-09 18:27:07 Mr. President,  ISIS, Russia and Iran will get a clear message if the bottom falls out of the price of a barrel of oil. No foreign oil purchased by the USA will send a message loud and clear. We cannot have chemical weapons used on ANY human beings or animals.

2989 2018-04-09 18:26:45 Oh yeah, you're right. Thanks for reminding me about pre 2014 petrol prices when the crude oil price were relatively higher. Post 2014 has really worked wonders..
2990 2018-04-09 18:26:33 Lol. Threatening the people of BC. You're a moron! How about you stop digging up the earth in the most harmful way of getting oil? You don't care about BC. Have you come here and met with those that oppose it to hear them out? Get off your twitter and stop bitching like Trump!
2991 2018-04-09 18:26:32 @cheapyxo Tea Tree oil has been the best thing for my skin. Have you ever used it. It’s amazing.
2992 2018-04-09 18:26:21 In Turkey, an oil tanker ran into a seaside mansion. On the bright side, now we know what the director of "The Emoji  Movie," is doing.

2996 2018-04-09 18:25:38 When we took to the streets in 2011, we knew we weren’t just fighting one government - we were fighting against six governments in the Gulf, who readily sent in their armies, backed by the West, who care more about their oil interests - @MARYAMALKHAWAJA
2997 2018-04-09 18:25:36 Pruitt should be water boarded with oil, given PTSD and left in Iraq with nothing! Exxon owns him!
2998 2018-04-09 18:25:32 You didn't read the studies. Of course stopping TMX reduces supply and demand because it makes oil more expensive...ex: trains cost more. Econ 101. Read the studies if you want to understand the issue.
2999 2018-04-09 18:25:30 The US is paying home owners to not let people check for oil on their properties! Been doing this since the ‘40’s! Look it up! #JusttheFacts CheckIt!

3004 2018-04-09 18:24:53 @AlbertaatNoon a little research shows that the opposition to TMX is largely funded by foreign interests in an effort to land lock Albertan oil. Why are our governments allowing foreign interest to block a project that is in Canada's best interest?!
3005 2018-04-09 18:24:47 Finger pop her and have ya hands smelling and looking like you just changed the oil on a '57 chevy.

3011 2018-04-09 18:24:23 Its also quite possible they've been vastly overstating their oil reserves for some time

3013 2018-04-09 18:24:03 I think everyone else's engines have improved on power output since last season, but Mercedes was absolutely stunted because they can't burn oil like they used to. That's why these 2 races haven't been an absolute blow out by Mercedes.

3018 2018-04-09 18:23:45 The only thing that’s going to make a difference is when the first Nations get in the oil and take the government and the diocese out of the loop

3021 2018-04-09 18:23:23 The truth is that for hundreds of years people worshiped as the pleased in Arab lands until these countries were colonized, oil discovered, and conservative tribes like the Wahabis found source of political empowerment by denying others right to worship.

3029 2018-04-09 18:22:45 During that meeting with Putin, Trump is trying to figure out how to give that money back. Probably in a secret oil deal somewhere in the world.
3030 2018-04-09 18:22:10 There is no requirement to pay for oil in dollars, it's just a convenient measure. But if you want to believe it makes a difference, I'm not going to argue.
3031 2018-04-09 18:22:07 How is there no baby oil I’m tryna get charcoal

3033 2018-04-09 18:22:02 I control my food intake, I use olive oil, I reduced butter and fats intake. I run for 10 minutes and cardio for 40 minutes at least 3x per week. I consume only plain water. I avoid late night dinner. Where did this 2.3kg come from?

3037 2018-04-09 18:21:40 Fair comment. I think concern is the salary karlson would command which may hamper his value. I think what ottawa would want is several assets and a dman thats a number one pairing. So for the oilers klefbom is the best oil dman in the past couple years. Doubt it will happen tho
3038 2018-04-09 18:21:37 Sigh.
Premier Notley announced today ( and previously) that restricting the oil flow that crosses the border between AB and BC is a definite option. 
2 I find it hypocritical that BC is fighting this expansion when they rely on our gas and oil to provide the lifestyles they have.
3039 2018-04-09 18:21:22 This has escalated to the point that until that first barrel of oil slurps out of the end of the pipe (years from now), nobody is going to believe it will actually happen.
3040 2018-04-09 18:21:12 Actually they'd import more oil from Washington. @jjhorgan helping @realDonaldTrump Make America Great Again.
3041 2018-04-09 18:21:08 It sounds like you want a Hunger Games type world where the cities can impose upon the people in the rural areas?  It could be so efficient, you could force everybody in Iowa to farm, force those in West Virginia to mine and North Dakotans will frack for oil and gas.
3042 2018-04-09 18:21:06 @Matters26382652 Let’s organize & stop waiting for a handout morsel from slow US banks... let’s go international! let’s be oil tycoons! #WeAreThePeople
3043 2018-04-09 18:21:04 We love the Cherry Harvest...almost as much as our Olive Harvest to make our DOP Extra Virgin Olive Oil! 
3044 2018-04-09 18:21:02 My point is, on the long run it's not sustainable.

Prices of crude oil would soon crash, nigerias debt is rising.

The cost of these programmes are enormous and they would expand. Meaning LESS INCOME AND MORE DEBT.

Greece would be childs play if something isn't done soon
3045 2018-04-09 18:20:53 Michelle compared Trump to one kind of parent while comparing Obama to another. That is analogy, not desire for nanny state. Are you distorting on purpose or do you lack reading skills? I’m not impressed with your oil industry shill site.
3046 2018-04-09 18:20:52 It is so frustrating!  They talk and act like snake oil salesman and they get away with it
3047 2018-04-09 18:20:49 Take baby oil and your fav loose pigment or highlight and mix : Fenty Body Lava..dame texture and everything lol
3048 2018-04-09 18:20:44  ooh, good thinking. Would you add anything else? Or just salt/pepper/oil?
3049 2018-04-09 18:20:37 Dear #BritishColumbia it's time we find out how committed you are to your convictions. Since you can't block new oil & gas development & expect to share in it's abundance elsewhere, a choice will soon be at hand. Either allow the pipeline or pay $4/litre for gas! #TurnOffTheTaps
3050 2018-04-09 18:20:36 Well, it's even now. Mercedes can't burn the oil in the engine anymore. Lewis wasn't the better driver when it is even. I agree that luck is a factor in every race though.
3051 2018-04-09 18:20:33 The federal government just gives the oil industry billions?!??!?
Bwahahahaha.
It's funny because you actually believe this.

3053 2018-04-09 18:20:19 Alberta lives on oil. They don't care about anyone but themselves.
3054 2018-04-09 18:20:13 You mean you didn’t have to change the timing belt or ever get an oil change or transmission fluid or power steering or brakes?

3061 2018-04-09 18:19:30 I highly doubt if the UK trained Dr. Bashar would gas his people. 1st time it was a false flag to attack him. Bibi & Trump knew about the 911 & plots to attack Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Cuba back in Bibi’s 1990’s book. Bibi’s script to help Israel expand & steal Arab oil.

2. Eat less (else wont be well productive)
3. More water and vitamin C helps
4. Have a good sleep before studying
5. Have only a book on the table, empty table helps.
6. Bathe, apply oil and comb and good perfume.

3106 2018-04-09 18:13:39 Recent reports claim Ford and GM plan to cut production of small cars and sedans in the U.S. Fuel prices are low and sales of pickups and SUV's are soaring. But are automakers ready if gas or oil spikes again?

3115 2018-04-09 18:12:45 Not the cost of oil, the cost of everyday life and civilization.
3116 2018-04-09 18:12:45 No.
It is cheaper for production companies to transport oil to market by pipeline, than by rail. If pipeline capacity is offered, it will be taken, and inefficient rail will be dropped. Simple economics.
3117 2018-04-09 18:12:42 i clean it with argon oil wash lol
3118 2018-04-09 18:12:38 On a side note, I won a mini scented oil diffuser from an amazon giveaway

3121 2018-04-09 18:12:17 For the oil discoveries forecasting, we argue that the IMF should *at least* wait until Final Investment Decisions have been taken before factoring in the growth boom. Some countries - like Ghana and Moz - got caught out with heavy oil/gas-spurred borrowing when oil price crashed

3125 2018-04-09 18:12:05 I use pussy juice as beard oil. Keeps it from looking and smelling like a hipster beard.
3126 2018-04-09 18:12:03 Because XI aren’t paying much to play there are they? Like the article said, could turn into a discussion of “well Lucas Oil is just fine, why do you need a stadium?”
3127 2018-04-09 18:11:55 I hate when I stress out about ordinary social interactions. Idk how I would ever be able to talk to Yadi if I can't even talk to the woman at Wal-Mart about getting an oil change. #stlcards
3128 2018-04-09 18:11:48 I want that Purpul oil plus Spray. Also want Nat Moisture Hair spray. My hair better thank me 
3129 2018-04-09 18:11:43 Sure! Our potus wants the good old oil days. The.people want clean energy and all the jobs that come with it. We should be leading this not resisting it. Of course we don't have a leader so...
3130 2018-04-09 18:11:40 People are going to use oil, we should use our own instead of shipping it in.
3131 2018-04-09 18:11:21 And don’t forget that apart from Israel’s illegal occupation of Golan Heights it is also illegally drilling for oil there with approval of #US
3132 2018-04-09 18:11:19 Given 1/2 a chance jjhorgan would support n approve oil pipelines.

3133 2018-04-09 18:11:17 worst case, you can always scour them & reseason. It takes awhile & many coats of linseed oil but well worth the trouble.

3135 2018-04-09 18:11:01 Why is the #oklaleg going after everything BUT oil?  We are not taxing them even close to the regional avg.  They won’t leave our oil untapped,  they are literally trapped here and should pay equitable taxes.  #OklahomaTeachersWalkout @OklaEd

mom: well did you read your horoscope? maybe try some coconut oil..
3143 2018-04-09 18:10:10 Hard to believe there was a time in my teen years when I rubbed ALCOHOL on my face. Smeared toothpaste on zits to dry them.
Now I am googling the fastest shipping method for face oil and eye hydration masks while rubbing on hand lotion.

3145 2018-04-09 18:10:05 Yeah, oil companies are dependent on the government & rest of Canada, not the other way around. 

Pipelines are much safer than rail. Ethically?? You’d prefer oil from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela than Canadian! You’re a special kind of stupid. #TransMountain #CdnPoli
3146 2018-04-09 18:10:02 Back in the 70's we could have had solar power but oil and gas stopped it. Then the 80's hit and it all started going down hill.
3147 2018-04-09 18:09:56 Not sure where in the world you are at, but for us, the beans are going mostly to China (for now), corn tends to go south, Wheat goes to General Mills in MSP.  It costs a lot to move beans west by rail, especially when the rails were full of oil.
3148 2018-04-09 18:09:42 Nobody should be planting at 10MPH in rocks but the cylinder will bypass oil to prevent damage. No-till will require more down pressure and is a perfect fit for Delta. Just make sure your planter is heavy enough to keep the units in the ground. That’s why we have weights on ours

3152 2018-04-09 18:09:29 It’s not a conspiracy site is common fucking sense. It’s the same reason the head of the Environment Protection Agency is an oil tycoon, the head of the Federral reserve is a Wall Street banker, etc etc stop trusting your government so much they have been bought a long time ago

3156 2018-04-09 18:09:04 If pop centers skewed results say in TX, then CA should blow TX or any other red state away on scale. It doesn't apparently.
3157 2018-04-09 18:08:55 Left pic is the Golan heights. Vast oil reserves that Israel already sold the rights to.
3158 2018-04-09 18:08:54 People on FB asking what language the Jah Oil armed robbers were speaking. Our desperate need to attribute evil to the other, to sanitize our image and position ourselves as incapable of doing bad. Smh
3159 2018-04-09 18:08:52 So...we don’t have 5$ a litre gas now, every major economy is pushing towards electric cars and heat and moving away from oil as demand for it is at an all time low... there certainly won’t be much of Alberta left for tourists to visit...
3160 2018-04-09 18:08:31 Lol try Castor Oil !!! It made me go in labor the same night
3161 2018-04-09 18:08:26 Well I don’t like baby oil. I bought it because i like to support Rihanna 
3162 2018-04-09 18:08:22 Can't go wrong with a little red onion. Or maybe some spinach pan-seared with a bit of sesame oil
3163 2018-04-09 18:08:18 It’s obvious that RealDonad_Trump is hankering after war at the bidding of Israel.  

Let’s not forget Israel is still in illegal occupation in Golan Heights (Syria) and also illegally drilling for oil there (Genie Energy).  Nothing said about that of course by #US and #UK govts.
3164 2018-04-09 18:08:10 We already have access to world markets and ship oil.  The BC people don't want the extra because of rightful enviromental concerns.  Also you promised First Nations right on their own lands ... so now you are going to break that?  You are playing with fire.
3165 2018-04-09 18:08:06 Everytime I take my car to Jiffy Lube for a OIL CHANGE so as the dude come back and star talking......

"Other than the oil change you need-"

Me: Aaaaaahhhhhhh stop talking! Oil change that's it!! What I don't know won't hurt me lol...
3166 2018-04-09 18:07:58 Ah effectivement il a du l'enlever, c t sur l'armée US et l'oil
3167 2018-04-09 18:07:56 I need  to make an appointment to get my oil changed but i would rather take a nap
3168 2018-04-09 18:07:56 Mr. President, you must know that Israel would love aside to be removed? Then they can create a Palestinians Homeland in today Syrian land? Islamic brotherhood would be the new Islamic Syrian state? Turkey gets oil? WTF!
3169 2018-04-09 18:07:51 depends on how much diamonds gold oil copper platinum ...can get ..? 'world' needs 'resources' 

plenty people ( +all costing dollars ) 

you asking very difficult question

give you answer in 24-48hrs after exploding heads committee meeting ?
3170 2018-04-09 18:07:47 There are lots of physical assets - land, schools, hospitals, territorial waters, oil, etc. Isn’t all that matters that people trust the currency?
3171 2018-04-09 18:07:39 I would be interested how the discussion goes when Eleven gets a full season at Lucas Oil under their belt. Good for those teams. Even more apparent that Eleven are victim of circumstance
3172 2018-04-09 18:07:24 Actually, the price of gasoline has been consistent with the rise in oil prices. My data shows $10 rise in barrel equals .25 cents at pump. So when oil was $40 a barrel, gas was $2.259. Course you have states ripping you off to pay for other nonsense.
3173 2018-04-09 18:06:33 So...the Royal family drinks? They also fly in models for paid sex, enslave women from the developing world as their sex slaves, party 24/7, and steal all that oil revenue to buy art works.  Any conscious Muslim who thinks “Saudi” is Dar-ul-Islam needs to be medically examined.
3174 2018-04-09 18:06:30 Useless. We're about to deplete all the oil reservers and we'll all be driving electric vehicles in the future.  But teddy bear futures are looking bright! 
3175 2018-04-09 18:06:26 Don't run from GOOD fats! Raw almonds, olive oil and avocado... Its necessary to help absorb the nutrients from other foods you eat!!!
3176 2018-04-09 18:06:23 "The incident has been blamed for the deaths of five fishermen in a fire sparked by clean-up workers who were trying to clear the oil by burning it off the water's surface"

"We got this"
*lights fire*
"Oh..."

3179 2018-04-09 18:05:57 coconut oil is the answer to everything

3181 2018-04-09 18:05:52 Genius on policy is a real stretch.  He was given a list to roll back clean water and air rules for oil and gas and we are all going to pay for it.
3182 2018-04-09 18:05:52 Wow! More than £2,000! Jeezo Scotsman, you are going to get an award for this magnificent piece of reporting. Seeing as you are on top of your game, any chance of finding out what happened to Scotland's oil wealth? I'll give you a wee hint, it's maybe got to do with Westminster.
3183 2018-04-09 18:05:40 Jason wants people to think Canada is only country to have carbon tax.  Jason loves the uneducated.  All investment should be in oil, it will always be worth more than 110 a barrel.
3184 2018-04-09 18:05:32 As far as they're concerned, Intel could've come from mosquitos as long as it gave them a pretext to bomb Syria. They don't care about the truth or evidence. They want regime change, a puppet they can control in Damascus, and all that syrian oil.
3185 2018-04-09 18:05:32 Wouldn't they have to buy about $500B?  And that's going to be a problem because the US only exported $77B worth of oil in 2017.  They'd have to overpay and probably end up losing about $100B on the deal.  Every year.
3186 2018-04-09 18:05:03 While Black Widow could use her spycraft skills to expose the ways in which oil etc. companies have been pretending they don't know about climate change, and are paying lip service to green energy
3187 2018-04-09 18:04:59 WTI oil at $62.70/barrel, +$0.65.
3188 2018-04-09 18:04:56 *เข้ามานั่งฟัง*
3189 2018-04-09 18:04:55 Tell them they owe you another oil change. They could’ve messed your engine up
3190 2018-04-09 18:04:53 “Truth be told, we don’t think there ought to be a carbon-based energy industry by the middle of this century,” @gmButts, May 2012.

Also, Butts claimed the oil sands had expanded too much and needed to be stopped, including stopping pipelines.

Mission accomplished

3191 2018-04-09 18:04:31 Is it that they can’t handle it, or that they make more money rifining lighter crude because sask and Alberta oil costs too much to get there? I honestly don’t know this answer and am looking for information.

3195 2018-04-09 18:04:04 Chain jewelry in a knot? Put olive oil on it, put it on a flat surface and pick it apart with needles. Then wash in soapy water
3196 2018-04-09 18:03:53 The point is: let’s start innovating! Researching, developing, etc. Let’s stop selling off our dirty oil, not caring whose lives, lands and waters it damages. Let’s stop beating this dying horse of an industry and be leaders in new industries.

3201 2018-04-09 18:03:08 So anyone who climbs an oil rig is a hero now? If Gabby Giffords climbed an oil rig, would that make her a hero? No, she's a hero because she fights for new gun laws to make it harder for crazy people to shoot at Congresspeople (like Giffords, Scalise, Jeff Flake, etc).
3202 2018-04-09 18:03:06 I was telling my fil about my inspection needing to be done and the oil changed but chase didn’t have time even though he’s off today running errands in mp but that’s beside the point he took my car and let me drive his truck back to work and he’s getting all that done for me 
3203 2018-04-09 18:03:05 trump would prefer to 'retire' the House and Senate and be the sole authority. This is,of course, dictatorship. He'd also like to hand Russia Syria on a platter. All that's left is oil. Killing civilians means no one in the way to protest the new power structure.
3204 2018-04-09 18:03:02 I've pointed out a simple solution which should have been considered when billions were pouring into the oil sands-build a refinery in AB so the value add is within province. I have nothing against oil production & pipeline but I do have an issue with heavy oil  in our waters.

3207 2018-04-09 18:02:55 Nice for Rachel to say that but, As an Albertan, I doubt the sincerity. She believes oil should be left in the ground.

RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.

3238 2018-04-09 18:00:19 Those refineries can't handle heavy oil. That was also an export pipeline. 

Nfld oil should supply eastern Canada but they ship it to the US instead.

3245 2018-04-09 17:59:53 Massaging oil into your entire scalp everyday when you’re not washing it is not a hair growth method. Why do people think it is?
3246 2018-04-09 17:59:48 I live in Las Vegas and over the years have had lots of friends and clients (web development) who were prostitutes. The sentiment you express is based upon complete ignorance.

3252 2018-04-09 17:59:11 How does a seed germinate?

First, it drinks. Water swells its stale body and softens its husk. The molecular gears of long-dormant mitochondria lurch and turn. Within minutes, the embryo begins to breathe. Starved, it unseals its reservoirs of oil and starch
3253 2018-04-09 17:59:08 Had the same experience stopped using it. I also still use the skin care oil

3291 2018-04-09 17:55:47 Syria is complicated. But 2 things are irrefutable: 1-US & allies have spent billions to fund headchoppers who've butchered 1000s. 2-US has stolen Syrian land & oil. You have no credibility. Furthermore, you've proven your loyalty is to Israel, who badly want Syria destroyed.

The transfer payments did not exist until 1957 !

Back when the east was sending money to west it was a couple hundred million a year.
When the price of oil skyrocketed the flow of cash reversed.

Alberta sends Billions not millions every year. 

Do the math

At times I add some different things but that’s the base 

For example I use a cinnamon coconut Oil, and XCT oil the last few times

3369 2018-04-09 17:45:03 Did you just not read this part? 

"More than 300 impact and benefit agreements have been signed between energy proponents and Indigenous communities in the last decade"

Yeah they talked to a guy, and then continued giving examples of other nations that have bought into oil.
3370 2018-04-09 17:44:47 But @razorfist Michael Moore said we went in for oil!
3371 2018-04-09 17:44:20 Disgraced ex-journalist @ggreenwald on @democracynow pushing his bizarre counter narrative of Trump/Russia unopposed. Going so far as to normalize Rex Tillerson as (former) Sec. State. 'of course all Oil Men are friends of Russia!'
3372 2018-04-09 17:43:59 With all respect.  Mr. Trump is about to take us into another false flag war in the Middle East.  For oil and the pocketbook of the industrial-military complex and screw We The People.  Q is a CIA psyop.  We better all be soldiers now, cause Russia isn't going to sit by this time
3373 2018-04-09 17:43:48 The vast majority of our fuel comes from Washington State.  Even with the pipeline expansion that wouldn't change.  Why?  Because your unrefined oil goes to export not domestic use.
3374 2018-04-09 17:43:44 Those are actually "oil" burners and better used for meth than crack.

3385 2018-04-09 17:42:30 Say what you will about our dependence on fossil fuels, but the oil & gas industry in areas such as discovery and pipeline and wellhead management provide great use cases for BD and data science. #clouderaac
3386 2018-04-09 17:42:27 So your allowed to use it? In some cases?.
There was a time when i didnt want to use oil. But that was short term. Some substrates or surfaces just need an oil finish. Such as that beautiful door you finished. Regulations are alot different here oil. But the times are changing...

3410 2018-04-09 17:40:34 So you want to repeal theCtax and go back to taxing the major oil sands polluters?

3423 2018-04-09 17:39:19 course he would the people from AB just dont seem to get is that BC’rs love their land &coast more than oil & money. All alberta need to do is convince the operators of the pipelines to pay for any spills on land or coast butt they have yet to even put that option on the table.

Takes decades for these type of massive shifts in a society. The carbon targets are unrealistic and won't be met.

Also my car showing me error of adaptive light after service but they refuse to fix. Pathetic service experience
3434 2018-04-09 17:38:05 First of all. Look at all the oil they got onto the backdrop I’m equally concerned with that

We're not a petro-state Jim.    The oilsands is privatized.    The loss is to the Texas oil corp.

3446 2018-04-09 17:37:14 When we learn to punish greed, abolish racism, become smarter about religion, teach kindness and mindfulness for others as a species.

Achieve that we have a new world overnight.

But that world doesn’t suit those who sell arms, oil and opium, who benefit financially from greed.

3448 2018-04-09 17:36:55 I agree, but removing Assad doesn't create stability. If one justify war over oil then one at least should have the guts to admit that. The Saudi regime is a bloodthirsty dictatorship too, no one complains about that.

3454 2018-04-09 17:36:21 I called the dealership and he said whoever said that was incorrect he said normally they’ll trip because I didn’t get the oil changed but I told him there was never a light that came on so I didn’t know... so he said he was 90% sure he could get it covered for me

3467 2018-04-09 17:34:56 Campaigning again/still/always @RachelNotley ? Why can't The Feds and Alberta demonstrate to BC that an oil spill will never happen and that the corporations responsible will pay for the clean up? They can't! and that is the bottom line. Trudeau screwed up big time on this one.

3469 2018-04-09 17:34:44 @simisara980  Absolutely yes for the pipeline I voted NDP and will again but they are dead wrong here we need oil products and the money made from shipping it for a while to come I drive and car and heat my home and am realistic!
3470 2018-04-09 17:34:35 Since oil wars unless seriously ill or missing limbs you aint even in same league as new comers who many hail and hearty but mention PTSD etc and get up to top of list. All been planned. For me thise born here all races should get higher points to stay in area. Now i see yuppies.
3471 2018-04-09 17:34:25 No,  oil Jonny. I wish it was 
3472 2018-04-09 17:34:24 While I appreciate you need for political capital in Alberta, what the world needs from leaders now is leadership in the face of #climatechange Supporting oil is not what is needed. Support businesses that are part of the solution, not the problem. #CalgarianAgainstKM
3473 2018-04-09 17:34:23 I am certainly not advocating Alberta separation. I am pointing out the absurdity of a landlocked province separating from a tricoastal federation because it has hit a roadblock in getting its oil/natural gas to tidewater.
3474 2018-04-09 17:34:19 The word is out that oil is not a fossil fuel.  It’s a renewable hidden by the those benefiting

3484 2018-04-09 17:33:34 I wonder if any of the neighbors know I'm the one that's been putting baby oil on the car door handles while they sleep. So far I've watched a few accidental face smacks but not anyone that deserved it.
3485 2018-04-09 17:33:26 Not super tankers that carry 130,000 tonns of crude oil!
Just truck it from Burnaby!

We’re not anti pipeline, just don’t want the risk of our waters & coast!

Alberta stands to benefit billions as does All@of Canada, but we suffer the consequences when there is a spill, forever
3486 2018-04-09 17:33:26 New truss-rod nut, bit of oil. Action seems pretty sorted now, but there's adjustment in it, if needs be.
3487 2018-04-09 17:33:18 Actually that is the point of taking down statues and revisionist history. To make ppl forget. The smart ones never do.

3491 2018-04-09 17:32:21 Ok point taken. How much is the oil?
3492 2018-04-09 17:32:21 Been putting coconut oil on my face and arms after showering for years now, and lemme just say that it’s a godsend for super dry skin.
3493 2018-04-09 17:32:19 There's also a helluva lot of oil and minerals. The only reason they create wars.
3494 2018-04-09 17:32:09 Leah’s a diamond! She just sat there for an hour rubbing coconut oil in my eyes to get the eyelash extensions off
3495 2018-04-09 17:32:06 I hate getting oil changes!!! They always gotta come with some extra shit that gonna cost you more than what was expected!!!!
3496 2018-04-09 17:31:52 Oil on canvas?!!! This is epic
3497 2018-04-09 17:31:46 my oil change is taking forever .....and I’m hungry
3498 2018-04-09 17:31:18 What is basis for saying Chinese solar subsidies are in excess of multiples of market costs? Do market costs include carbon, health costs of burning coal and oil?
3499 2018-04-09 17:31:07 Yo I’m also impatient as hell  but ima try it. I have the latisse lash growth oil or whatever it is but I don’t see a difference so I need something else
3500 2018-04-09 17:30:58 Be  smart enough to know to Fight wars on your own home turf, let them come to you. On their turf you will lose - they have upper hand and know the terrain. Greed/oil are the only reasons our soldiers have been sent there.  Its sad that our military soldiers are pawns of Greed.
3501 2018-04-09 17:30:55 It’s actually shocking how much (shit juice) oil is extracted when you grill meat. I’m constantly astounded.
3502 2018-04-09 17:30:51 True, but is shows what you are truly willing to do and what initiatives are you willing to take on to lessen the need. I am tired of being portrayed as ignorant, when I have been following the oil issues for over a decade now. That's why I know we can't just turn off the tap.
3503 2018-04-09 17:30:44 I mean if he advances battery technology where all the oil oligarchs lose out, then I’d consider that a win. Bring on the Battery Barrons’!!
3504 2018-04-09 17:30:38 One of the reasons I’m for “green” energy is that if we reduce dependency on oil, we can save buckets (tankers?) of money by not providing security to the Middle East. Until we do, it’s in “our interest” (or Exxon’s at least) to ensure there is regional stability.
3505 2018-04-09 17:30:32 Y ni hablar de los medicamentos que consumí desde la niñez. Y el colesterol, los metales pesados de los años que viví en ciudades, los humos de gas oil con azufre, etc
3506 2018-04-09 17:30:32 It seems like the Moslems and the Isrealies, and lately the US, have no qualms in using their own as assets and martyrs, and stopping the oil to Europe is resource-control Subversion. Care to Kazackstan & other pipelines. China would be up next.
3507 2018-04-09 17:30:30 I suppose you're talking about his return of the money that didn't belong to the US, and I suppose we should keep the oil too?  How soon small minds remember where we were when Obama started,  more growth in his 8 years than since.  So sad how our education system has failed you.
3508 2018-04-09 17:30:24 RU pipelines to EU bypassing Iranian waters. Turkey big beneficiary if RU oil cheap option. Follow the money....
3509 2018-04-09 17:30:20 i wanna see u fry the chicken without u running away the moment it touches the oil
3510 2018-04-09 17:30:14 My type of self medicating is guzzlig oregano oil and chasing it down with airplane fuel

3512 2018-04-09 17:30:05 I need to get my oil changed.
3513 2018-04-09 17:30:03 Use better oil
3514 2018-04-09 17:29:57 I agree let's turn off there gas and oil and then see if they want to stop the pipeline
3515 2018-04-09 17:29:56 So, you recommend we bomb and destroy a stable nation so that we can commandeer their oil, natural gas, pipeline?

Gotcha
3516 2018-04-09 17:29:55 After miss dolezal is thru you gonna need some plugs I bet she’d oil your scalp with chicken grease
3517 2018-04-09 17:29:49 The House just passed @kcbecker & @Singer4Colorado's bill to require increased reporting for oil & gas incidents. Every House Republican voted 'no.'  The bill now goes to the Senate #coleg #copolitics
3518 2018-04-09 17:29:46 Coming from an Alberta NDP minister holding an activist sign destroying our Oil industry. Sad Shannon.
3519 2018-04-09 17:29:42 PSA: peppermint oil does wonders for bus sickness. 
3520 2018-04-09 17:29:39 If you think there is a difference between the Conservatives and Justin Trudeau you don't know about what bills they both support. 

Both parties are lead by the Oil and banking industries. 

Both parties support fascism and Wahhabism.
 
#NDP is the only alternative.

3521 2018-04-09 17:29:36 As someone who has worked in both, heavy crude and so called clean oil,I can attest that they're both pretty dirty when you get them on yourself.
3522 2018-04-09 17:29:18 "Alright. I just hope this prophecy doesn't come true. Right now it's darker than the oil in Oil Ocean, the Black Arms, and Shadow's primary fur color combined."
3523 2018-04-09 17:29:13 Except... He absolutely has signed off on a lot more than what you're talking about. Look at the Stay of Requirements on the Emission Standards for the Oil & Natural Gas sector.
3524 2018-04-09 17:29:06 Corey gardener dose not represent his constituents and hides from us like the pos snake he is. He strictly works for oil industry. Funny how after adapt took over his office in the chase building he decided to move into a federal building...
Says a lot about him.
3525 2018-04-09 17:29:03 Amazing how when you talk about getting OUT of SYRIA, BOOM! All of a sudden there is another CHEMICAL ATTACK....REALLY? YOUR BUYING THIS BS???? WHY would they do it? YOUR BEING PLAYED ONCE AGAIN! It's all ABOUT THE OIL! GET THE HELL OUT OF SYRIA!
3526 2018-04-09 17:29:02 We are not stupid, closed  refineries, build leaky pipelines, send oil to USA, refine, pay to bring it back.
3527 2018-04-09 17:28:48 Amazing how when you talk about getting OUT of SYRIA, BOOM! All of a sudden there is another CHEMICAL ATTACK....REALLY? YOUR BUYING THIS BS???? WHY would they do it? YOUR BEING PLAYED ONCE AGAIN! It's all ABOUT THE OIL! GET THE HELL OUT OF SYRIA!
3528 2018-04-09 17:28:42 Most effective long term is education, though it is multi pronged attack. Education, workplace, on streets and in machinery of gov.
3529 2018-04-09 17:28:41 Name one renewable that employs as many people nation wide than oil and name one that creates the money needed for this socialist country to keep its head above the water. Name one!

3533 2018-04-09 17:28:23 House worth £250K in Wrectum, must have at least two bedrooms full of cocaine and be built on a fucking oil well. Horrible shithole that place.
3534 2018-04-09 17:28:22 Massive load shedding in Karachi, no one asking to KE they are changing fuel adjustment charges with full units, but not paying to @SSGC_Official so they reduced their gas pressure. If @KElectricPk cannot run their generator's from oil then why they charge fuel adjustment charges
3535 2018-04-09 17:28:22 THAT ORANGE OIL STRESSES ME TF OUT BUT THE END PRODUCT IS SO GOOOOOD.
3536 2018-04-09 17:28:16 you're delusional. do your own research if you actually give a damn but I don't really imagine you do. and maybe look up 'ecosystem' &  'sustainability': two things that don't matter to oil shills, but do matter to living creatures including humans who's survival depend upon them
3537 2018-04-09 17:28:05 For the oil companies
3538 2018-04-09 17:27:55 Today I found out that some people use monkeys to collect coconuts for their oil and so essentially coconut oil is useless to me rn there is nothing good left in this world
3539 2018-04-09 17:27:47 What trust?

In Trump?

The VERY FIRST THING Trump's GOP congress did was to try to eliminate ETHICS OVERSIGHT!

Trump's cabinet is THE most corrupt since before Roosevelt.

Billionaires like the Kochs, Mercers, Russian oligarchs & lobbyists like the NRA & Big Oil OWN the GOP.
3540 2018-04-09 17:27:39 It's not easy transitioning away from oil.  We can only do a few things at a time.
3541 2018-04-09 17:27:29 HUGE shout out & thank you to @HeritageMazdaBA @MazdaUSA This Mama was brought to instant tears after an incredibly kind gesture. Knowing I was headed back to my daughter in @AIDHC, they waved my oil change fee so I would have one less worry. I truly can’t thank you enough  
3542 2018-04-09 17:27:27 1st thing to understand is Fraser Institute a corporate funded mouthpiece for the oil, gas extraction industry in the nasty business of disseminating propaganda intended to minimize effects of global warming whose 'studies' are neither scientific or peer-reviewed; thanks anyway..

3550 2018-04-09 17:26:20 Agreed with fall of Ottoman Empire. Many of the new nations were created with "unnatural" political borders, requiring stongman-rulers to keep them in check. The US disposed of the democratically elected leader of Iran in favor of the Shah due to oil nationalization efforts.
3551 2018-04-09 17:26:05 Or alternately, ask "do you support turning Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet into an oil port" and most people respond with an overwhelming NO

Scotland has the following % of UK production...
96% oil
62% seafood
60% gas
40% wind, marine and solar energy.
Scotland has a higher GDP than 6 other EU countries combined.

I say @RachelNotley needs to immediately stop the carbon tax & join @PremierScottMoe fight @JustinTrudeau.

3568 2018-04-09 17:24:48 Sir, considering oil, in whose interest would it be to drag us back in, further endangering our relationship with Russia? What if one of ours did this? The refugee situation in Europe is coalescing; my hunch is that they’re related.
3569 2018-04-09 17:24:43 It’s not theory, these are technical facts that one commoner doesn’t know about, Electricity is produced either from Gas or furnace oil currently other than Coal or Bagasse ... Gas is acquired from SSGC which takes from Oil & Has Exploration companies.

3594 2018-04-09 17:22:57 Where are pipelines poisoning waters? People didn’t put the oil in the sand that is oozing into the water table around fort Mac. People are cleaning up the place by removing the oil that is naturally there. And we are using that to keep cars going and people alive.

3598 2018-04-09 17:22:41 All we know that the oil went to Israel . Baghdad govt and politicians knew and when some Kurd politicians faced with a question they did not deny but said let it go wherever . this came up to the surface when wrangling began between two main Kurdish parties . ISIS took part too

3623 2018-04-09 17:20:28 Yes, and Bahrain's tight oil will be light sweet crude, which doesn't compete with Alberta oil sands' heavy crude. So, apples and oranges.

3626 2018-04-09 17:20:09 I alternate between the eco olive oil and the eco Jamaican black castor. The olive gives me the best definition but it can be a little drying. I'm actually gonna start trying a natural gel like aloe Vera or flaxseed for a better moisture balance
3627 2018-04-09 17:19:27 Demanding more money from hard working Canadians will never earn respect! Exporting  oil means Billions for Canada making life easier for tax paying Canadians & Natives. How does Twinning existing pipeline scare anyone? Alaska sends Oil Tankers past BC everyday & it’s OK Why?
3628 2018-04-09 17:19:16 Climate change, Fukushima, oil spills and plastic garbage.
3629 2018-04-09 17:19:16 All you have are quotes from oil exectutives FFS!!!  

C'mon that's just stupid.
3630 2018-04-09 17:19:07 Possible scenario but costly: the cost of imported oil will increase proportionally inside China. Also, it is going to hurt the supposedly yuan-denominated oil futures contract that China is trying to use to make its own crude marker

3632 2018-04-09 17:19:05 He made 140k last year driving for uber & Lyft! It’s more cost effective for him too since he doesn’t pay for oil changes or gas.
3633 2018-04-09 17:19:02 I get flaking really easily so I keep my products simple. I moisturize with aloe Vera juice/gel then seal it with a light oil like almond (coconut is too much protein for me). Then I let that soak into my hair for about 10 minutes. Then I go through with a denman brush and gel
3634 2018-04-09 17:19:00 If you're wondering why @EPAScottPruitt hasn't been fired yet, it's because he's doing EXACTLY what his boss wants him to do. Deregulate, help out @realDonaldTrump's friends in the oil industry, and...building a soundproof phone booth for some reason?

3638 2018-04-09 17:18:46 I came to this dealership 2 hours ago for an oil change. Since then they’ve recommended $1,100 worth of additional maintenance and have yet to finish said oil change. Does anyone know a hostage negotiator in the Columbus area? I just want to go home.
3639 2018-04-09 17:18:41 i just got the most amazing massage and now i forever want to slather myself in lavender body oil
3640 2018-04-09 17:18:40 What about corporate welfare for the oil and gas industry? If we’re going after corporate welfare, then we need to do it consistently. #oklaed will not be used for partisan infighting. #oklaedwalkout #okea #NotEnoughOK
3641 2018-04-09 17:18:37 @MyproteinUK Curious why Vitamin D3 and Antarctic Krill oil are substantially more expensive than in January? £5.26 to £8.49 and £12.59 to £19.49.
3642 2018-04-09 17:18:30 Seriously fuck doing an oil change on the ground in 85 degree weather.
3643 2018-04-09 17:18:27 Carter literally took coconut oil last night to anoint me in the kitchen because I was having an emotional breakdown.

3645 2018-04-09 17:18:22 U.S. Military has no business being in Syria, we were not invited but the Russians were. THIS IS BULLSHIT!!! NO MORE WARS FOR OIL AND OPIUM!!! Let Assad investigate the matter as a sovereign country it is their right.  U.S. needs to focus on the deep state operatives UK, ISRAEL.

3647 2018-04-09 17:18:17 Hydroquine is what worked best for me. I liked the Murad age spot stuff. And I LOVE the Sunday Riley UFO oil it’s been really good for the dark spots from pimples
3648 2018-04-09 17:18:06 Did K-Elec manage to overcome line losses and electricity theft incidents? Karachi is huge equivalent to about 4 cities of Lahore size. Ore Haan we have depleting Gas reserves with too low exploration activity due to declining oil prices. Int’l companies are leaving country.
3649 2018-04-09 17:18:06 Kenny Kent Chevrolet literally charged me for them to fuck up my car harder than it was when they got it. They’re money-grubbing pieces of shit who tried to charge me $700 AND THEY DID NOTHING EXCEPT DRAIN MY BATTERY AND PUT A HOLE IN MY OIL PAN.
3650 2018-04-09 17:18:02 It doesn't though, that's the issue! Everyone assumes no pipeline! No oil! The oil is still going to travel, just now it will tie up rail. These arguements become invalid  because now you create more uncertainty in the transportation of said oil.

3651 2018-04-09 17:17:51 finally know how to use oil paint, it’s goinnnnn
3652 2018-04-09 17:17:36 well, yes....but the positions are pretty inflexible....the basic facts of KM pipeline: ie, huge increase in number of Burrard Inlet oil tankers and vociferous First Nations opposition, make compromise ultra-difficult....
3653 2018-04-09 17:17:34 So Amber Rudd sets up a cross party team to take on the knife crime... what a way to wriggle out of the police cuts and sucker other parties to share the blame when it all fails  @UKLabour is there any oil left in the lamp ?
3654 2018-04-09 17:17:27 There is no coconut oil in coconut sugar. Have a great week ahead!
3655 2018-04-09 17:17:25 Put coconut oil on like a cotton swab/napkin and they come off like crazy
3656 2018-04-09 17:17:15 Keep hoping they'll take on domestic assault, but probably not
3657 2018-04-09 17:17:08 It would be like Bush congratulating the Daytona 500 winner and then saying he uses Bush oil in his car.   Or Carter congratulating World Wildlife Federation and then saying that the elephants eat Carter peanuts.    No .. not something they would do
3658 2018-04-09 17:16:37 Sibanda is a smart guy, he's only welcoming a guest who is too desperate for a photoshoot with war vets. In simple terms, Sibanda is against sanctions yet @nelsonchamisa is an advocate of sanctions. The two are like water and oil. Lol
3659 2018-04-09 17:16:36 มี oil กับ soil ด้วยค่ะ ตอนเด็กๆอ่านออยกะซอยมาตลอด พึ่งมารู้ตอนฟังเพลง55555
3660 2018-04-09 17:16:35 The money would be better spent helping citizens trade their gas engine in for an electric car. But go ahead and promote big oil. Help them kill the planet. Shame.
3661 2018-04-09 17:16:35  A lot of people see words they can't pronounce and think 'dangerous chemicals'. Many of these products are things like canola oil and garlic powder. Nothing to be scared of. Transparency is good.
3662 2018-04-09 17:16:32 We have arrived from work today and the fridge was even louder and there is a crude oil/ rotten egg smell in the kitchen.  I've recorded a video with decibel meter. Emailed your customer services and opened windows and doors. Fridge spec says 44dB -Sound is 72DB 4 metres from FF.

3664 2018-04-09 17:16:31 when i was younger our teacher was asking everyone what our fathers did. i didn't want to say he worked for an oil company for obvious reasons so instead i said he worked in lubrication 
3665 2018-04-09 17:16:17 today I am making calendula oil 
3666 2018-04-09 17:16:16 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3667 2018-04-09 17:16:14 Thanks Becky. They are all natural dyes/flavours although it looks ridiculously bright. It was a pin head drop of each colour! And low sugar oil based cake, but the icing and surprise sweets are another story! I've found a few random talents since start of #phd
3668 2018-04-09 17:16:13 Sorry, that doesn't necessarily follow. It's irrelevant what currency oil is settled in. What's relevant is if China sells more to the US than it buys, it ends up holding US dollars, period. They must use those dollars for something priced in US$. Paper or goods. No other option.
3669 2018-04-09 17:16:13 I have a trick, leftover liquids like stock or wine I freeze in ice cube trays then pop them out and store in ziploc bags, u can also puree up herbs with a bit of oil and put into containers to use in sauces or chop and freeze to add to recipes
3670 2018-04-09 17:16:11 Weasel Weaver and Horrible Horgan are bowing to the USA’s strategy to keep Canadian Oil and LNG landlocked  the losers are every one of us Canadians 
3671 2018-04-09 17:16:11 “preemptive action” to help a Texan oil company? Is it really in our “national interest” to meet the demands of a foreign corporation?
3672 2018-04-09 17:16:01 Plant Therapy has chosen to work very closely with world renowned essential oil expert Robert Tisserand on this subject. We echo his view on this subject, that There are many reasons why some essential oils are not recommended to be used on or around children.
3673 2018-04-09 17:16:00 @dbrand is there any other skin with rough texture like dragon skin? I also bought marble and wood skins but they feel like soft plastic and easily get scratches and skin oil smudges.
3674 2018-04-09 17:16:00 Our policies against Russia are a big mistake Putin backs Assad bc he buys oil. If the Senate wouldn't force them to do business with a small country bc of US sanctions, he could stop backing Assad. Just like Cuba if we would bought their sugar, Cuba could have been an ally
3675 2018-04-09 17:15:56 Weasel Weaver and Horrible Horgan are bowing to the USA’s strategy to keep Canadian Oil and LNG landlocked  the losers are every one of us Canadians 
3676 2018-04-09 17:15:55 Avoid ! We have been in one with China for years. China Free Rides on world oil flow. They do not pay the true cost of WAR for free flowing oil but seek to displace the US petro dollar as the worlds reserve currency!! Oh then they steal our IP and block markets.
3677 2018-04-09 17:15:54 You are a fashion icon but yesterday's  red oil  didnt work for me.
3678 2018-04-09 17:15:52 What if I drank my weight in red wine and bread dipped in olive oil?
3679 2018-04-09 17:15:47 @trader280 rare to see it down with crude up 1.3$. Pb is last usda reports were bearish for bean oil.

3682 2018-04-09 17:15:16 Yeah it really didn’t help that we had a public demo slot on the last day and so all the midnight oil was burned refining that at the last minute on top. Madness
3683 2018-04-09 17:15:16 You haven't tried the cbd oil ?
3684 2018-04-09 17:14:59 Just a quick reminder to everyone that u all take FIVE GUYS for granted imagine everyone telling you it does the BEST burgers but u will never ever be able to try one cos they cook their fucking chips in peanut oil ((((: feeling a bit of sympathy for myself tbh

3686 2018-04-09 17:14:47 So basically you're a 'bum-boy' for @RachelNotley & Big Oil? Quelle surprise!  Is that bitumen on your chin? #SiteC #KinderMorgan #LNG #undrip #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3687 2018-04-09 17:14:41 A lot of focus in this pipeline debate is on Big Oil, Kinder Morgan, and the protests. The thousands of small businesses and their staff may not be able to continue while the heel dragging continues. #ableg #cdnpoli
3688 2018-04-09 17:14:39 Yes babes
Already tried Vaseline and I’m testing the castor oil 
I just started it yesterday
3689 2018-04-09 17:14:22 @ChickfilA my local store just gave me a drive through order with napkins shoved into the fry carton, ketchup on top holding them in place. Made them completely unusable since they soaked up the fry oil. Make sure stores know to be careful when putting napkins in, pretty please
3690 2018-04-09 17:14:01 With Chinese and wine? Then oil up and play a bit of sax after?
3691 2018-04-09 17:14:00 Arganmidas Moroccon Argan oil 5ml bottle @190tk only
3692 2018-04-09 17:13:57 Co to te absorbing oil sheets ?
3693 2018-04-09 17:13:50 IMO for 3 reasons: 1. oil industry needs to plug their s#it everywhere. 2. composites provide reasonable resistance w/less weight so more fuel economy provided steel frame gives protection. 3. other materials require scorched earth cultures, mass animal slaughter + higher costs
3694 2018-04-09 17:13:45 There hasnt been much news about The Umbrella Academy series but I have found out that there is an oil painting of #5 on set and thats great

3697 2018-04-09 17:13:08 Hey wait a minute....you campaigned on a promise to diversify the Alberta economy so we could get off the oil price roller coaster and now you want to invest the people’s money in this pipeline....already campaigning for the next election eh!
3698 2018-04-09 17:13:01 Stop producing oil and there will be billions of people without food. I produce food. I depend on fuel and oil to operate to help feed the world. Can you say the same? If you don’t depend on oil like you claim, then I doubt you contribute as much food to the world as I do.
3699 2018-04-09 17:13:00 That cannot be any further from the truth. The railway is already at its breaking point from a traffic stand point. So much now, that grain and many other international agriculture shipments are being pushed aside to make room for energy. Oil belongs in a pipeline, not on a train
3700 2018-04-09 17:12:58 Slap my ass call me Cindy shove your fist in my ear and slather vegetable oil all on my penis you beautifully created infant retard @burkeeeeeeee
3701 2018-04-09 17:12:52 it’s mayo with a lower oil content so it’s lighter and it has both corn syrup and sugar so it’s sweeter and apparently some spices
3702 2018-04-09 17:12:52 Imma put some cooking oil on the door handle and lock the door.
3703 2018-04-09 17:12:49 Well said and can't help thinking they wouldn't stir the pot having heard Trump was pulling out or even giving more negativity with the  Russian involvement with the Salisbury attack  and  chemical weapons. All the timing just stinks of not Assad, Trump said he would get the oil.
3704 2018-04-09 17:12:44 would recommend that you lightly pan fry it over some oil to get rid of the bitter outer layer, add water and let it boil, and let it simmer down after the water boils :) good luck, Jen!
3705 2018-04-09 17:12:36 control oil heater makes you canned
3706 2018-04-09 17:12:28 Okay, I was scared bc I can’t afford to go any lighter  I tried oil but that didn’t help, I’ll try again tonight though!
3707 2018-04-09 17:12:19 Putting carrot oil on instead of suncream is the worst thing I have ever done
3708 2018-04-09 17:12:08 How many times have I told you that you give them bitches the dick and oil money minus your heart?  HOW MANY GADDAMN TIMES?!
3709 2018-04-09 17:12:07 ALSO TODAY in Locust research: finding their traces in British officer's accounts of the Iranian oil fields in the 1920s and 30s.  A certain Capt Cadman was continually stymied by swarms...and the fact that Persian oil workers ate so many locusts they had to get med treatment
3710 2018-04-09 17:11:52 I'd accept "Oil moves in price, nobody really knows why, but we'd be willing to offer a guess, if you'll click this link"
3711 2018-04-09 17:11:51 How sure are you it was Assad? Doesn’t make sense at all. Syrian rebels have been accused of doing this to their own people. 
War. Oil. $.
America is not asleep anymore.
3712 2018-04-09 17:11:48 He clearly said his mind is made up. Saudi oil is Cleeaaannnn Oil. It's just bull.

3715 2018-04-09 17:11:36 Came to a new spot in Douglas to get my oil change so I wouldn’t have to drive all the way to Valdosta to the dealer and never in my life have I seen some one change ya oil AND vacuum out ya car Ain’t God good I’m sold they just made a new customer off that alone
3716 2018-04-09 17:11:36 I think after a few days it will!! That’s happened to me before..believe it or not with my pale ass lol...maybe use a good moisturizer and an oil? Idk..lol but it’ll go away!!
3717 2018-04-09 17:11:33 Meanwhile our waterways will be polluted by coal, oil, and the rest of the crap Pruitt will allow dumped into our streams.  Please just quit the lying
3718 2018-04-09 17:11:24 1) This is not US shale.
2) Bahrain coastal tight oil does not need a vast and expensive pipeline
3) If #TransMountain has all the capital they need to build KM, why are they now asking Alberta govt to buy in?  

#bcpoli #cdnpoli
#StopKM #KinderMorgan
3719 2018-04-09 17:11:21 The Deep State, George Soros, is committed to taking out Assad they want pipelines to Mediterranean so oil doesn’t have to go through the Strait of Hormuz or Turkey. Naturally Europeans won’t  do their own Dirty work.
3720 2018-04-09 17:11:14 @realDonaldTrump You're going to start #WW3 based on a possible false flag? Why would Assad, Iran, Russia do a chemical attack? If you do this you will historically be known as the duped president who started WW3 so #GreaterIsrael can have its oil expansion & world domination.

3735 2018-04-09 17:09:51 Yg argan & virgin olive oil. For straight to frizzy/ dull hair
3736 2018-04-09 17:09:47 My Mom copped this coconut oil shampoo/conditioner and my hair lookin and feelin so right
3737 2018-04-09 17:09:35 Accepted on all points.  Beyond the question of crude oil pipelines (I live in Vancouver), what concerns me is the lack of collective clarity on the way forward.  Are we then are ragtag of incoherent visions from sea to sea? Is this how we will feel our way forward?
3738 2018-04-09 17:09:33 I don’t really like how Hyundai suggests oil changes every 7k - way to not take care of your vehicle.
3739 2018-04-09 17:09:30 Now... I know the people changing my oil out smell the loud.
3740 2018-04-09 17:09:25 How about getting the Burnaby protesters out of there with a larger population of pro oil Canadians? It's time
3741 2018-04-09 17:09:23 Probably does not shower or bath to conserve our most precious resource water. Likely no water bottles of any type. I don’t know what has happened to balance. We seem to seek extremes. It is fine to preserve and reduce oil use but realism is needed.
3742 2018-04-09 17:09:23 Is there a shop I can buy your linseed oil at in London these days?
3743 2018-04-09 17:09:21 Wah coconut oil do for u tho
3744 2018-04-09 17:09:12 Mmmm!
3745 2018-04-09 17:09:01 How the hell are pipelines allowed to be built without segments that automatically shut off any oil flow at that site once a leak is detected and sensors every 100 feet to detect if there is a leak? What lack of rules allow these massive spills over and and over? Use technology!!
3746 2018-04-09 17:08:44 2/2 Or we will be forced to send the army against some first nations people who are against it. No one wins. We all lose except Big Oil. How did we allow this?
3747 2018-04-09 17:08:32 I work everyday until Thursday this week and I have to do laundry, get an oil change, put windshield wiper fluid in and pack for myself and my boyfriend AND pack my dogs stuff for my parents 
3748 2018-04-09 17:08:15 here’s my advice:

- yes eat that
- no, do not text back the fuckboy

3749 2018-04-09 17:08:14 Ag loves Pruitt on WOTUS. Everything else tips the scales hard to oil, which is fine, I mean, if you're an oil gal/guy. Not so good for biofuels.
3750 2018-04-09 17:08:14 It's not just the Turks and Qatar that want that pipeline. America, Britain, Germany and Saudi Arabia want it. It's big money and it would wreck the Russian economy, so Putin and Iran won't allow it. Turkey wants Syria's Northern oil fields too.
3751 2018-04-09 17:08:14 #Alberta #NEP2 #ABseparation I'm not sure I'm sold on joining the US. They have lots of their own issues. But separation looks better every week. It may not help get oil to tidewater, but it will end equalization. I imagine SK and MB would join us.
3752 2018-04-09 17:08:09 "And it’s not just that he’s incurious and inflexible: selling snake oil is his business model, and he can’t change without losing everything."

The hope of Larry Kudlow.
3753 2018-04-09 17:08:01 Things like this reinforce the idea of an "establishment" that sets the country on a certain path no matter who is in power. Whether you watch Fox or MSNBC, war with Syria is being sold to the public despite all the holes in the story. Gas and oil are being universally ignored.

3760 2018-04-09 17:07:25 The British, went as far as south America, took the land that doesn't belong to them, fought because of the land and kill millions because of oil, shame to Britain
3761 2018-04-09 17:06:45 I’ve never tried that. At first I was using all olive oil products but I had to change it.
3762 2018-04-09 17:06:34 Coconut oil is a tan girl's bestfriend i s2g yall gotta stop sleepin on it
3763 2018-04-09 17:06:23 Oil is a commodity (with a suspect future), while Ontario cars and Quebec aerospace are not.  Fair that that plays a factor?
3764 2018-04-09 17:06:22 Hearing people talk about how a global recession is coming SOON, BASED ON CURRENT DATA, is just like hearing environmentalists 40 years ago talk about how the world would run out of oil in 30 years. This isn't to say that the constant overleveraging of nations isn't bad in the LR
3765 2018-04-09 17:06:14 Exactly. And the oil industry is a master at getting subsidies from every government on the planet.
3766 2018-04-09 17:05:57 Notley says today Canada is not "far off" from a constitutional crisis. She also told cabinet she talked to John Horgan, and told him Alberta will introduce legislation this week to turn-off-the-taps (or at least control the flow of oil to BC)
3767 2018-04-09 17:05:53 Threats to undermine the #RFS are threats to the men and women of rural America. @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump - it’s time to stop bailing out oil refiners and grant #RVPrelief

3774 2018-04-09 17:04:51 Then, later, they got better support from China and the USSR funneled through newly independent South Yemen (IIRC) and shit got real. And Oman got increasing support from then-monarchy Iran and from Britain (who owned their oil concession...).
3775 2018-04-09 17:04:49 surely the solution is to get rid of London green belt & restrictive planning laws & move the economically active population into that area - Scottish oil has already been used to pay for London infrastructure so a couple of million Scots are entitled to move to jobs there

3784 2018-04-09 17:04:08 Proud of you and your work. A sister died of myelofibrosis MF after more than 30 years of multiple miscarriages, periodic blood infusions, implanted radiation seed. Drs said was likely caused by toxic chemicals in oil saturated soil.
3785 2018-04-09 17:03:58 Kissinger white paper after OPEC flexed its cartel muscle in the 70’s. Mother Jones mag reported it; can’t find it online now but I’ll keep looking. 

Basically, plan was to occupy ME militarily, to secure our access to oil and be able to deny access to USSR & China.
3786 2018-04-09 17:03:57 Scotland is the18th richest country in the world, one of the few with oil. We also have vast natural resources. Under the control of another country who controls our economy. Now just imagine what we could do if we controlled our own powers & levers. Too wee, too poor

3794 2018-04-09 17:03:03 biofuels as "waste byproducts" of other industrial processes tend to be economical but low quantities (French fries oil). Biofuels for the sake of "not oil" tend to be highly inefficiently produced (corn ethanol)

3805 2018-04-09 17:02:04 This is the state they created intentionally. They created the refugee crisis by getting involved (and still do, we just moved some ships to syria for example) they create terrorists for profit (oil among others) then invite them in, there can only be one reason for it, control.
3806 2018-04-09 17:01:54 Why do @kennedystewart @ElizabethMay @MPJulian @DonDavies @FinDonnelly @R_Garrison prefer getting Alaska oil via Washington than from their neighbouring province?

3809 2018-04-09 17:01:46 But it makes more expensive considering logistics arrangements and maintaining inventory to meet rising load requirements in summers. Oil is expensive than Gas. Current price of oil is around $ 62/bbl but Gas costs about $3/MMbtu  - it’s not as easy as it looks.

3828 2018-04-09 17:00:20 It's a conflict over oil and natural gas. Russia is supporting Assad because it doesn't want a pipeline deal with Qatar. The US is allying with Qatar and Saudi Arabia to hurt Russia and gain additional influence in the region. Neither side has good intentions, neither will fold.

3832 2018-04-09 16:59:59 There will be a time to short oil stocks/ETF's, but I don't think 2H18 is the time to do it, as oil market dynamics are tightening at a rapid pace.

Once Tesla gets to annual million of cars, tens of thousands of semi's, and Level 5 autonomy (~2025), then I'll short it with you.
3833 2018-04-09 16:59:58 You’re welcome and Mine had did the same thing. Then it broke off. Never seen my hair so short. So I cut it and started natural remedies. Like mayonnaise with egg honey and olive oil. Our hair is so sensitive. We gotta show it extra love and care
3834 2018-04-09 16:59:52 I’m curious how you manage your oil-free lifestyle on Twitter. Did all protesters walk to site or were they bussed in? Are environmentalists the only ones allowed to use oil products and determine who else is allowed to use them? Time to take the blinders off.
3835 2018-04-09 16:59:40 There is huge number of people who fly into the oil sands to work and then return with a pay cheque to spend in their B.C. community.  Oil Sands employment helps ALL of Canada.
3836 2018-04-09 16:59:31 Why u don't run plant with furnace oil
3837 2018-04-09 16:59:30 Again, you assume the world is going to follow this idea of no oil. So while we could rip off the band-aid, and not transition, we would actually be doing a disservice to the world. Even renewable energy has negatve side effects, what are your answers to those?
#AcadianWolfe
3838 2018-04-09 16:59:30 They're alright ; - ; I would suggest using an oil cleanser following up w/ foam cleanser for 100% makeup removal bc it'll require less friction and force against your skin 
3839 2018-04-09 16:59:30 So keep crushing our oil industry
3840 2018-04-09 16:59:26 Wow. My three year old just looked me dead in the face and said: "Ecomodernists are selling you snake oil." This is huge.
3841 2018-04-09 16:59:24 Jason always happy to spend money to help out foreign oil companies as long as funds are not wasted on schools and hospitals.

3843 2018-04-09 16:59:19 I live in Alberta and I know introducing renewable energies will give more to local economies than supporting giant oil corporations and their pipelines.

You're asking for another global, economic depression as you're left with depleting resources and a destroyed environment.
3844 2018-04-09 16:59:17 If we did rule the world it would be a better place. We would be too pissed to give a shit about oil 
3845 2018-04-09 16:59:13 Thanks.  Scanning the match ups has drawn me deeply into the playoffs in spite of the Oil.  It spells out very clearly that I will cheer against the Ducks with all the fervor of otherwise cheering for the Oilers.

3852 2018-04-09 16:58:44 When @ElizabethMay stops flying anywhere or doesn't use any oil related products . We know she drinks enough wine that is delivered by diesel.  She should lead by example. Turn off her gas heat to her homes. Only eat what she grows..  canada needs to get it's products to markets
3853 2018-04-09 16:58:39 Wetin be all these? I just know palm oil, g/oil and blue band. Taink you!
3854 2018-04-09 16:58:37 He’s not a deep thinker. When Joe Rogan told him the Iraq war was about oil, he said “but we didn’t take the oil, that’s a conspiracy theory. It was about democracy...” It’s like the historically and politically curious/literate parts of his brain are missing.
3855 2018-04-09 16:58:34 Why is regular coconut oil for food cost less than those for hair when it’s basically the same thing expect one say for Hair? #naturalhair
3856 2018-04-09 16:58:14 The current ruler, Sultan Qaboos, ousted and replaced his father and began receiving revenues from oil concessions and the thing turned almost immediately, as he focused on co-opting former leaders of the rebellion, building infrastructure in the areas they drew support, etc.

3861 2018-04-09 16:57:36 Ok. Try going through a day of your life without the use of any oil or it’s byproducts. We are dependant on the oil industry. A transition away from oil will take way longer than you can imagine and at the expense of what? Just by existing we deplete the planet.
3862 2018-04-09 16:57:28 I need to know what people are using to make themselves look so shiny. I got body oil and I am no where near as wet looking as I want to be-wtf is the recipe?!

3864 2018-04-09 16:57:01 Premier @RachelNotley says she had a very frank chat with BC Premier @jjhorgan and told him Alberta will move forward on legislation giving Alberta the power to restrict oil flowing into his province. #ableg #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3865 2018-04-09 16:57:00 Hemp seed oil was what Henry Ford wanted to run cars on. As well as build them from the plastics made from hemp fibre.
3866 2018-04-09 16:56:58 True. Funny to see the governor of Washington state at a news conference with Horgan backing the latter on blocking TMX. His state receives so much oil tanker traffic from Alaska.
3867 2018-04-09 16:56:40 Alaska? Oil? Pretty legit
3868 2018-04-09 16:56:23 Ugh! Those are the worst. Have you tried a lavender or tea tree oil on it? Heard somewhere that's supposed to help.
3869 2018-04-09 16:56:18 the us is obsessed with oil
3870 2018-04-09 16:56:18 As one of Thatcher's cabinet admitted, they couldn't have afforded the de-industrialisation without the flow of Scottish North Sea oil. Don't all thank us at once.
3871 2018-04-09 16:56:12 Why are the Koch Brothers still free? Everyone knows they are guilty of bribery.

Why is George Bush still free? Everyone knows he only started the wars in the Middle East to destabilize the region to raise oil prices so his family can make more money.

3877 2018-04-09 16:55:43 they are cursed since they killed the grandsons of the Prophet. They are so dumb that they cant even drill the oil and sell. They need BP and other to do this. UK gives them 30%, these morons spend that money to buy weapon or football clubs.
3878 2018-04-09 16:55:41 a 40% increase in oils sands production is key to your climate plan? 

And it is not my oil industry and they can damn well use all the existing infrastructure they have.

3880 2018-04-09 16:55:23 I am a Republican because I believe the purpose of Government is to protect and serve the wealthy and privileged classes, wage war for profit, reduce government spending on education, infrastructure, social security, and medicare, and to turn over public lands to the oil industry

3883 2018-04-09 16:55:01 personally i would have thought highlighting the fact that nearly 50.000 vessels transit the bosphorus every year, the danger of such an accident affecting oil/grain/ferts supply out of the black sea is enormous, especially with ukr/rus/rom/bulg grain exports adding up to be cont
3884 2018-04-09 16:54:56 The Moroccan Black Soap is made from Olea (olive oil & macerated olives) and is basically an olive Ferment...super nourishing, but the smell . I just can’t. So does anyone use this kind of soap and love it??
3885 2018-04-09 16:54:56 my boyfriend put some argan oil shit on my hair to massage my scalp and make my hair all nice n soft but now i’m at work looking like a greasy ass dog
3886 2018-04-09 16:54:55 use coconut oil if u have some!
3887 2018-04-09 16:54:50 To try and get Assad to let pipeline through from Qatar,  for Europe natural gas/oil
3888 2018-04-09 16:54:47 And there is another win for the foreign oil & gas companies funding the attacks on Canadian energy companies.
3889 2018-04-09 16:54:44 there is actually no evidence it's just people telling stories and the evidence that is shown is horrible like the hand that is so white supposably or the oil on the curtains at looks like grease from cooking too much hamburger meat
3890 2018-04-09 16:54:21 interview for oil & gas company tomorrow, big bread 
3891 2018-04-09 16:54:19 He doesn’t care about anything else but oil. If it doesn’t make money, he just doesn’t think about animal cruelty. As a Canadian, I’m also disgusted
3892 2018-04-09 16:54:18 The only time I ever saw four dollars a gallon for gasoline was under Obama shutting down the pipeline and limiting oil production didn’t bring the price down at all
3893 2018-04-09 16:53:32 That tweet reminds me fellas make sure to take your biotin fish oil and one-a-dayz…summa about to hit and we don’t need these women effecting our health…hair line..or our wallets
3894 2018-04-09 16:53:27 Norway punches above its weight due to wise investment of its oil & gas wealth in its massive sovereign fund, the Swiss are EU rule takers, Iceland were over dependent on the financial sector and sufferered in the badly crash, an experience the UK is likely to follow on Brexit...
3895 2018-04-09 16:53:25 I haven't heard any news on Paul Martens family owning most of the oil tankers bringing crude  into the East Coast.  Why would they want to get rid of their cash cow?
3896 2018-04-09 16:53:23 What do you think of SCO short oil industry etf. Not been going up as much as I hoped from the electric revolution. My Exxon puts worked much better.
3897 2018-04-09 16:53:20 Adulting for today led to paying some bills, scheduling my oil change, and taking a moment to thank God for being able to do everything I put my mind to.
3898 2018-04-09 16:53:15 Made homeless by the US regime change policies. Syrians of all walks of life had a country until the US and their allies decided to bring freedom to the Syrian oil fields

3900 2018-04-09 16:53:09 EAC/EAB has been telling U about the Prophecy against Damascus (Isaiah 17:1-3 KJV) right? UR the POTUS 4 such a time as this! I'm sure U have been told that. Heard U said that there is evil N DC, not just bad people, but evil. Put anointing oil on the Resolute Desk & C change.
3901 2018-04-09 16:53:09 They've got to get @PaulStamets out to North Dakota with his awesome (Oyster?) mushrooms to eat up that Keystone oil spill! Break down those ancient carbon chains the old fashion way!
3902 2018-04-09 16:53:04 Definitely spilled hot oil on myself today trying to cook.

3906 2018-04-09 16:52:50 Hey, loves!!! Has anyone ever used REAL Moroccan Black Soap??? If so, did you add anything to it to kind of cover it’s scent?!  I was sent one from a family in Morocco that makes it & also provides Argan Oil for some of the top skincare & cosmetic brands in the U.S.

3911 2018-04-09 16:52:28 Excellent point. Personally, I failed to see what was so chic about a woman with a rear end the size of a oil tanker.

3914 2018-04-09 16:51:44 There's oil and there's tar sands oil. Tar sands oil is neither high quality, profitable, competitive, or sustainable. There's a point where we should know to call quits.
3915 2018-04-09 16:51:24 So on Saturday while enjoying my "me" time, while busy cooking I realise I'm out cooking oil & don't have money to buy it, Karabo rocked up the ff day with malvapudding & custard, rolls, wine & the oil. 

Friends like that are a blessing from God.

3918 2018-04-09 16:51:12 Yeah, except most forecasts show oil consumption growing to about 115 million b/d by 2040. Decline in consumption probably won't start until 2050 or 2060.

3921 2018-04-09 16:51:06 Americans will pay more for gas this summer than they have in years, reports The Wall Street Journal, with prices at the pump likely the highest since 2014. Average prices reached $2.70 per gallon last week, with OPEC’s 2016 decision to cut oil production driving up crude costs

3924 2018-04-09 16:50:37 Nothing will ever happen under this Liberal government......Gerry Butts is on record saying ‘We’ want to progress away from our Nation’s dependency on oil. Won’t matter how bad the economy gets, how big the national deficit grows, or how bad unemployment gets. Libs are brutal.

3926 2018-04-09 16:50:13 I belonged to the yellow house at school. They've been around for about 200 years. And I painted my room yellow in 2014 and I own a stunning yellow gown, sarong, silk sari, curtains & face oil. I think it's safe to say I'm the one cashing the royalties today. $BTC preferred
3927 2018-04-09 16:50:03 Why aren’t we using our own oil to refine?
3928 2018-04-09 16:49:40 After 2001 when 15 saudis (out of 19 attackers) flew into the twin towers to create the iraq war in 2003, they became the richest oil company on the planet over 15 years, they own nearly all our assets, they are on the UN panel for womens rights and now in control of western law.
3929 2018-04-09 16:49:21 Welp, time to oil my laptop cooling pad again. :p
3930 2018-04-09 16:49:18 He is doing great harm to our environment, public lands, water & by de-Regulations that should stay in place. Trump & he  are oil & gas guys to the point of leasing our land & giving away our natural resources. All for industry profit. Not to benefit the country. It’s a sellout

3932 2018-04-09 16:49:11 Your post is why I lose faith in Americas future and the role of immigration. It shows absolute ignorance of the world and economics. The poster is misinformed, a moron or both. America is now a net exporter of oil. Even when America imported oil, it paid for it, did not steal it

3934 2018-04-09 16:49:06 Let's say we could stop the flow of raw bitumen tomorrow, are you actually aware of the calamity involved there? Where is all that energy going to come from? I hate oil, and our dependence on it, but I also understand reality. So instead of pretending to be an eco warrior[1 of 2]

3947 2018-04-09 16:47:02 JK isn't investing in oil companies. He will deregulate, cut tax, cut the beauracracy and allow the free market to invest, as it should. An entrepreneur would understand that.
3948 2018-04-09 16:46:39 Well you’ve done a whale of a job keeping, resurrecting, primping and perfecting an archeological specimen of motorcycle history whose footprint is older than most readers, so Whale Oil seems not out of bounds of your huge accomplishments.
3949 2018-04-09 16:46:38 Traders are clearly looking the gift moose in the mouth today: Bank of Canada released a positive Outlook Survey, the greenback fell, oil prices rose 2%, and Mexico’s Finance Minister put odds on a new NAFTA deal around 80% - but the loonie is up less than a cent.

3953 2018-04-09 16:46:30 His pat answer to questions about which he has no clue:  "we'll know soon".
Looks like it'll be Iran, cause Russia is Trump's sugar daddy, and Russia loves Assad. So Trump can not go against either.
That leaves Iran.
Guess who has lots of oil?
WWIII if Trump goes against Iran.
3954 2018-04-09 16:46:03 Depends what for... if it’s baking - bananas are great as well as vegetable oil or aquafaba. In the mornings I have tofu scramble which is yummy!
3955 2018-04-09 16:45:56 I remember reading once that it's the closest oil chemically to human sebum, after spermaceti (from whales, so not a good thing these days) & it's absorbed very readily & is non greasy & has many uses.
3956 2018-04-09 16:45:56 Do you know what an analogy is? A good parent wouldn't let their kids smoke in the house b/c it pollutes the air. A bad parent would let their kids smoke in the house, polluting the air. Wind & solar energy is INNOVATION. Oil & coal are literally ANCIENT, FOSSIL fuels.

3968 2018-04-09 16:44:11 China targets solar for jobs to maintain social stability, the top priority of Chinese Communist Party. Solar also can help with public health crisis caused by burning coal, oil. And it helps China with its climate problems that it accepts and struggles with its response.
3969 2018-04-09 16:44:04 American Niggas: "Y'all got oil?"
3970 2018-04-09 16:43:57 It's criminal, we should be a major exporter of fish given our resources, we don't let foreigners sail in and take our North Sea oil, hands off our fish!

Btw, they make powdered peanut butter which is a horrible thing when you use it as intended (reconstituted with water for oil free lower calorie peanut butter) but excellent for blending into shakes for deliciousness and protein.
3980 2018-04-09 16:43:09 So me and Pippa have just fixed a plumbing problem in the house and I’ve never been more proud of anything in my life.

3983 2018-04-09 16:42:33 Governor Failing is failing you, Oklahoma. Why do oil companies pay such a low corporate tax rate in Oklahoma but neighboring states collect much more? WHO is in the pockets of the oil companies? Hint: She wanted to be President Dennison's VP: @GovMaryFallin

3991 2018-04-09 16:41:35 Nope. Making a mint selling snake oil for years to folks looking for help doesn’t earn anyone the benefit of the doubt. Quite the opposite.
3992 2018-04-09 16:41:31 Forgive me my ignorance, but doesn't the dearth of arable land in the ME make for an inherently unstable situation? How do they feed themselves?Seems like their only asset is oil, and the use of that endangers the planet. Could they start farming solar energy there, helped by UN?

3998 2018-04-09 16:40:30 Not taking into account Treaties, unceded lands? UNDRIP? Or the fact that when it’s built this will be a relic as the rest of the world moves to green infrastructure and Canada is still digging dirty oil out of the ground. We need to start the transition to GREEN now!!

4000 2018-04-09 16:40:26 Yes, thanks to the PCs who governed AB for 4 decades, and their so-called "AB advantage," prov squandered all its oil revenue or gave it away, and made public services dependent on royalty revenue--which will not come back.

If you can't operate responsibly without threatening public health + safety, then you're not welcome to do business here. This is a business opportunity for the right investors

4010 2018-04-09 16:39:25 For all #Trump bluster and theatrics, never lose sight of the fact that he is nothing more than a #lowrentKardashian A snake oil salesman selling a flawed product that kills. He promotes corruption. His mantra is lies. He IS NOT America!
4011 2018-04-09 16:39:21 Oh how could we forget about tea tree oil!! (But lowkey she's kind of a bop) but ya, all I do is drink water  can't help if this doesn't apply to you 
4012 2018-04-09 16:39:20 If you're looking for a recommendation, you might try Rihanna's Fenty matte foundation. I have oily skin too and I finally decided to try it..amazing. My oil hardly comes through even in hot/humid weather.
4013 2018-04-09 16:39:19 @De12a14 este cleri es el mismo que encabeza marchas violentas ! Que le reclamé al amigo de ellos Cristóbalito por lo de oil.Pagaron más de mil millones de dólares de mas al club de París y por sus vivezas nos retuvieron la fragata libertad por meses.102 años plus para la memoria

4017 2018-04-09 16:38:57 I get maaaad anxiety when I get my oil changed, I’m not prepared to find out more shit wrong with my car 
4018 2018-04-09 16:38:51 We are going to start protest, now KE will be responsible for law and order situation..if they charged per unit as per oil price why still no electricity, still no electricity, Pak army should take action

4020 2018-04-09 16:38:26 Ants lucky to have me. Filled up his tank and got his oil changed and put new windshield wipers on his car.
4021 2018-04-09 16:38:24 I’m happy for the Devils but keep in mind that Hall has been a huge driver to the Devils turnaround. He was disgruntled and cancerous with the Oil but he rediscovered his All-Star way with the Devils. But I do agree with your statement regarding Sabres.
4022 2018-04-09 16:38:19 Oil & gas workers in North Dakota have a death rate of 75/100K workers. Do you think wind or solar workers in ND have a death rate HIGHER or LOWER than that? Over all industries, death rate is 3.2/100K workers. Why should we send good men to their death just to pollute the air?
4023 2018-04-09 16:38:15 And where the hell do you think all the energy should come from? Solar? Wind? That technology is 50 plus years away from meeting even 10% of demand. I guess the Oil will just come from those country’s with despicable human rights. Educate yourself.
4024 2018-04-09 16:38:00 @POTUS progressives used to be the people that thought the car would take place is a horse. Now we sink clean and sustainable energy will take the place of oil! No one can stop progress. #renewablenergy
4025 2018-04-09 16:37:56 At my oil change I discovered my VIN was registered at the dealer in someone else's name for some reason.

DEALER REP:  (looking at her iPad after typing in my VIN) "Ripley?"

ME: "Huh?"

DEALER REP: "Ripley?  Is that you?"

ME:

4027 2018-04-09 16:37:49 Are you really asking if they know there are pipelines in Canada? Seems to me that's the problem here...renewable energy is the only answer and continuing to rely on oil and not move forward with the renewable Industrial Revolution ASAP is self-sabotage.
4028 2018-04-09 16:37:40 I haven’t used castor oil, but coconut oil has worked really well for me in the past!
4029 2018-04-09 16:37:32 #Oil and gas industries still receive subsidies. #ethanol industry receives no subsidies to produce a superior product. The same clowns want to put an end to federal crop insurance. These are good times for the fat cats.
4030 2018-04-09 16:37:19 No, stay out of the Middle East. We don’t need their oil and it’s time for the Middle East to fight Assad not us.
4031 2018-04-09 16:37:14 I had these for a little bit - or smth similar - and was told to use vitamin E oil(I got one from the body shop) and the patches did become way less red!  Not sure if it was due to the product or skin getting better on its own but rly worth a try!!
4032 2018-04-09 16:36:55 I really need to learn and remember how to change my oil lmao I can’t do these 90$ oil changes anymore 
4033 2018-04-09 16:36:45 After three fucking weeks of trying to figure out why my car is leaking out ALL of its oil... We have finally found out that the last mechanic probably caused the issue. Lols.
4034 2018-04-09 16:36:24 @JustinTrudeau You are in the unique position to guide Alberta into a more sustainable future. The oil sands, and all of the people working there, will become redundant as the world focuses on greener pastures. You have made a global commitment to those greener pastures.
4035 2018-04-09 16:36:16 if you're sensitive, maybe try wiping them off with baby oil?

4037 2018-04-09 16:35:42 Israel and the US (Deep State) are to blame for ALL the genocide in Syria since they are connected to ISIS et al by training, arming and funding them for YEARS to invade Syria for another NWO Regime Change and of course for the OIL Pipeline that Assad and Russia worked out a deal
4038 2018-04-09 16:35:40 'Attacks on Islam'? The adherents of #Islam number in the billions are well organised and have a warrior ideology. They are also supported by the political establishment  across most of the Western world and funded by oil money. Who needs defending from who?

4041 2018-04-09 16:35:01 Should be added to weekly supply data, US is no longer in a world of its own in oil.
4042 2018-04-09 16:34:58 If you  blame APC for GEJ's lack of savings during the oil boom of his tenure, and aren't willing to blame the "independent" NASS for scuttling  PMB's economic agenda (or trying to), then you're a HYPOCRITE
4043 2018-04-09 16:34:54 Sharing the story of #palmoil worker S -"Her husband works on a palm oil plantation of PepsiCo's business partner, Indofood. S is forced to go to work her husband--without pay--to help her husband meet a daily quota of work he couldn't reach alone." This is worker exploitation!

4051 2018-04-09 16:33:56 I bet it will also trigger their wives (if they have one). Oil rigs are one of the most dangerous jobs, w/ risk of death 8x higher. From 2003-2013, oil & gas extraction employees died at ~108/year, a yearly fatality rate of 25/100K (75/100K in ND), vs 3.2/100K in all industries.
4052 2018-04-09 16:33:56 Oooh!! I see!! Well I treated it with oil and it got better too but I am afraid to bleach them again...
4053 2018-04-09 16:33:54 Yooo, I was like “what? A giant person?” And then I was like “whattt? A dope oil painting under plastic??” And THEN “OoooH shiT! The WHOLE THING!!!”

4055 2018-04-09 16:33:42 Do you know the components of the increase in figures?
Were they from crude oil sales or exports?
Or cash swaps with foreign banks?

Please educate yourself and stop following dodgy narratives all around.
4056 2018-04-09 16:33:38 The righteous and lawless separate like water & oil no matter what you do they can never come together... Go figure
4057 2018-04-09 16:33:31 Agreed #PatientsBeforeProfits always, but the state is the one that should be providing the people in need with what they need, in my opinion. I don't mind growing and making oil for others, I would continue to do that regardless of them but it's their place to do it safely
4058 2018-04-09 16:33:28 The GOP thought climate change was not real long before Trump. As long as the fossil fuel industry has told them, with contributions, not to worry about it. At least since the 80's according to the leaked Shell Oil study.
4059 2018-04-09 16:33:19 When have you done anything but scream to leave knowledge to the high priest class and buy indulgences in carbon credits.

4063 2018-04-09 16:32:57 I hope Alberta turns the tap off to BC.  You guys want just enough of Alberta's oil to keep you smug & comfy and the Cdn economy as a whole is of little interest to you. But then: If socialists understood economics they wouldn't be socialists.
4064 2018-04-09 16:32:53 Trump should spend the rest of his life in an orange jumpsuit washing oil covered animals with Dawn for twelve hours a day, seven days a week. He would be chained to the wash station lest he wander off. He can just relieve himself in the jumpsuit.

4075 2018-04-09 16:32:00 The oil industry, contrary to what most believe, is very conscious of the environment. There are, & will continue to be, failures at times that result in leaks/spills. We don’t want this to happen any more than you do. Don’t believe everything negative about O/G industry.

4081 2018-04-09 16:31:19 You hate oil? Use less of it. 

Ammonia icy ball for the heat
Rocket mass heater for the cold
Natural building alone would take a big chunk out of fossil fuel use.

Legalize these if you hate fossil fuel oh so much.
4082 2018-04-09 16:30:58 Never. Always just rubbed coconut oil on him.  Washed him once and he sulked for about a week.
4083 2018-04-09 16:30:56 Combined 2017 net income for just 6 oil cos. (Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Total SA, Phillips66, Valero) = $59.4 billion. Combined net farm income for 2.2 million US farms = $59.5 billion. Still trying to find the hardship oil is experiencing. #ethanol #RFSWorks

4085 2018-04-09 16:30:46 You want to talk ethical???   Do you know how much foreign oil comes into ports in eastern Canada?    Last I looked those counties are not pillars of human rights, women’s rights or religious rights.
4086 2018-04-09 16:30:44 I got an invite to Happy Hour from a Toyota dealership. I felt honored until I saw that they're just trying to sell me an oil change.
4087 2018-04-09 16:30:39 "We're a minority, too"

4090 2018-04-09 16:30:25 My car been smelling funny every since I got my oil changed 
4091 2018-04-09 16:30:18 So if someone invests in a counties resource production which is ethical based due to Albertas ethical stance on clean production of oil there’s a conflict? I haven’t seen anyone shot in Canada or forced to work for nothing to get the oil out of the ground have you?
4092 2018-04-09 16:30:13 Tell me more. I’m desperate for a real candidate.
4093 2018-04-09 16:30:09 Let’s see how this shea butter oil works out for this growth 
4094 2018-04-09 16:30:05 Fair enough. Mine is basically oil changes. I've had it 2 years, and I've changed the brakes (almost as soon as I bought it ) and an oxygen sensor. That's it.
4095 2018-04-09 16:29:56 “...and then the Israelis beat off the Arab invasions... uh, stopped them...um, and the OPECkers retaliated by ...oh jeez...OPEC cut production which raised oil prices.”

4096 2018-04-09 16:29:50 Just something fishy about an Irish guy named Beto.
4097 2018-04-09 16:29:50 You wonder whether Trump, MBS, and Putin have a plan to spike oil to $100+ with a FAKE escalation in Syria while preventing Iran from receiving a net economic benefit. (war w/ Iran, sanctions). Everyone gets something, even Netanyahu.  Why would Assad launch nerve gas attack NOW?
4098 2018-04-09 16:29:36 Ridiculous, but unsurprising. One of the Zionist movement’s major successes is getting racist Westerners to see The Jewish People as white enough to be prioritized over those swarthy Arab hordes who are breeding and terroring all over our oil supply. But they’re still Jews.
4099 2018-04-09 16:29:26 @L0rdJu Sounds like a plan! Did you get the oil changed yet?
4100 2018-04-09 16:29:17 No, that would be like cutting off our dink cause a girl wouldn’t sleep with us. Put a $20/bbl tariff on all oil going there currently.
4101 2018-04-09 16:29:12 Winning contracts approved by the Iraqi’s is hardly “stealing”

This is called trade.

My issue was with your insinuation that oil was being taken without fair  compensation.
4102 2018-04-09 16:29:00 Follow the directions on the F52 link, and use lemon juice/oil and your favorite cheese. It'll be a delicious salad! (I like kale cooked better though - with garlic)

4111 2018-04-09 16:28:33 I never cared for @TonyRobbins any way. Slick snake oil. But he attacks #MeToo by using an example of why its needed. Hey asshole why dont you teach your clients how to control themselves? #charlatan
4112 2018-04-09 16:28:32 I agree and I wasn’t talking default. You inferred USTs aren’t speculative (=high degree of loss). “High” is relative but 5.5 points in TY (~3.5%) would be painful to UST holders.  So fair to consider what other invstments CH could diversify into.  Gold/oil won’t default either
4113 2018-04-09 16:28:17 Haha. Go live off the land hippie. Absolute hypocrite. Hates pipelines and corporations yet you likely purchase everything from corporations that are byproducts of oil. Correction; your parents likely buy you
4114 2018-04-09 16:28:15 Monsanto

Funny you were calling for more government earlier. Now it's the opposite.
4115 2018-04-09 16:27:47 @JoyAnnReid leader of Syria says he had nothing to do with this attack I would not put it past Putin and Donald Trump orchestrating a takeover using this as an excuse to gain control of Syria's oil and resources let's see who has controlled in the end
4116 2018-04-09 16:27:30 Every time he speaks - looking for any semblance of substance in his words...it’s like trying to juggle olive oil.

It’s beyond word salad. Just vaguely implied nothingness that he can never be held accountable for, yet sounds potentially significant.

And nothing will happen.
4117 2018-04-09 16:27:27 Not as wierd as an Irish guy named Beto.

Coal is brutal Y  dont  U keep that in the ground like oil? love 2 hear ur take on it.
4121 2018-04-09 16:26:32 What he is doing is pointing out the anti oil and industry policies of the NDP and Liberals so in just over a year voters will kick the Socialists out of office.
4122 2018-04-09 16:26:30 Oil Prices rose on, boosted by investor caution over an air strike on a Syrian airbase over the weekend, which overshadowed some of the concern that has undermined the crude market over an intensifying trade dispute between China and the United States
4123 2018-04-09 16:26:28 US automaker all in for Europeans growing electric car revolution! While hiding them in the US, to keep us sucking on the oil pipe!

4128 2018-04-09 16:26:06 How about CND gov starts using CND oil instead of importing it from unethical producers as well as the US we have the 3 largest oil supply in the world. Unless the others start cleaning up they simply do not reap the rewards of making money.

4137 2018-04-09 16:25:31 Congrats to grad student @Tiomurph for being awarded summer funding from the UNC Center for the Study of the American South for his awesome project on subsurface property rights in Texas' oil and gas sector. Thanks for your support, @UNCSouth!!

4139 2018-04-09 16:25:06 Honestly I love the oil memes because anything that takes the piss out of US military endeavors is good in my book.

Van leaking oil being towed to mechanic.
Money needed to fix it.

4143 2018-04-09 16:24:50 I think it's not 47..It might be 4T. Anything related to gulf oil?
4144 2018-04-09 16:24:46 Can’t wait for my Rosehip oil to arrive
4145 2018-04-09 16:24:45 The evidence is all around you and yet you don't see it. How long have you been a bot? I will not be distracted into a long conversation with a bot. Oil your parts. You sound like the tin man.
4146 2018-04-09 16:24:42 1- Risk of disruption increases, regardless of how small it is, & has to be reflected in the price. 
2- Permanent damage happens when capacity is destroyed, and that has to be reflected in lower current and future supply, which affect the price. Here we talk about oil facilities
4147 2018-04-09 16:24:29 Japanese was wrong. Iraq was intentional to get into a profitable war and for oil. The best way to not get shot is to show your hands and not make sudden movements and not reach for things and not run and not put the cops in danger at all.
4148 2018-04-09 16:24:25 The oil spills already as big as Paris and not a single peep from your fucking dear president. Thats what statesmenship these days for you ain't it? Fucking moron!
4149 2018-04-09 16:24:18 Did you know one Mr Rupert Murdoch and his friend Mr Dick Cheney have big interests in Syrian oil pipeline??? Just saying!!
4150 2018-04-09 16:24:13 Oven baked aubergine, so I had olive oil on it XD
4151 2018-04-09 16:24:09 Sydney Crosby uses coconut oil.
4152 2018-04-09 16:23:57 Even with the infrastructure, it's a lot more expensive to get oil out the ground in Argentina than in the US, and, with the US' success, oil prices remain suppressed.
One could say that Vaca Muerta's biggest obstacle is US shale success.
4153 2018-04-09 16:23:56 Whatever we get paid by England for our oil and gas :)
4154 2018-04-09 16:23:54 Shameless. Picking pictures to support your narrative. Opinion poll experts are akin to snake oil salesmen. "Maybe if we create enough blather, people will buy what we are selling". Butt out of the political prediction game. You further corrupt an already broken system.
4155 2018-04-09 16:23:52 Oh please, that would mean every pipeline to tanker port in the WORLD is a irreparable mess. News flash, they’re not!!! Oil is completely natural in its raw form. It IS literally plants & critters.  Biodegradable. Get over it.
4156 2018-04-09 16:23:50 You consider this makeup? I mean if anything it’s more of a body oil. It’s for your body....not the face
4157 2018-04-09 16:23:42 I’m officially a believer in the eco style black castor oil and flaxseed! My hair still soft and defined and NOT FLAKY on day tree! Believe de hype

4163 2018-04-09 16:23:01 put some coconut oil in it!! and just as long as you don’t regularly use a hair dryer, straightener or curler it’ll be growin in no time!!
4164 2018-04-09 16:23:00 In 1914, Britain was the worlds biggest creditor. 6 years later , it acquired war time sized debts & lost reserve ccy status to the US. The US chose to settle its debts with Britain. The US did not run trade surpluses with Britain to acquire GPB to buy oil.
4165 2018-04-09 16:22:52 Astonishing that anyone could buy the claim that "anti-resource" groups are better funded than international oil & gas & mining & all else.
The powerful posing as victims - and actually believing it.
4166 2018-04-09 16:22:51 You meant teach them (girls) how to cut the grass, change a tire, and check their oil.
4167 2018-04-09 16:22:49 If it doesn’t work, castor oil has done wonders for my eyebrows and eyelashes and it’s way cheap so it’s a viable 2nd option!
4168 2018-04-09 16:22:45 Pulled into a oil change place bc it said $25.00 oil change now!

“Okay that’ll be $76.34!” 
4169 2018-04-09 16:22:38 Yeah, but my career aspirations are p strict about plant usage, and I wanted to ask before buying cbd oil cause it's a little pricy

4171 2018-04-09 16:22:30 They use "Washington Based" like THAT gives it some credibility. 
To me, it has the opposite effect.
4172 2018-04-09 16:22:24 Oil is finite.  The more demand increases (war), the less available to the broader economy. Demand is relatively static, thus any interruption in supply has an out-sized impact on price. Selling would never be in order, so long as the supply/demand construct is seller loaded.

4175 2018-04-09 16:22:19 I hope your bemusement is tongue in cheek Simon, but for those out of the loop, the US energy playing field is dominated by executive policy, but Warren Buffet is who killed solar in Nevada; oil monopolies killed it in Arizona. Trump killed it in California with tariffs.
4176 2018-04-09 16:22:04 Oil is up refiners are buying directly from producers. As specs have stepped away. Now if managed money wants to buy they have to pay up a little. Last time this happened in size was Aug end. #oott
4177 2018-04-09 16:21:41 Here is hoping @NNPCgroup  start processing pending applications for oil companies to start producing and making Nigeria income. It is starting to put off inward investment from oil companies.. Lekoil a very good example..

4180 2018-04-09 16:21:33 May and Trump were stunned when Assad regained control in Syria backed by Russia. UK, USA, Israel and Saudi, were planning to share the spoils OIL. But Russia put the blockers on that, hence the story of Chem. Weapons being used on their own civilians by Assad. Remember Libya?
4181 2018-04-09 16:21:32 Rosehip oil udah wishlist ku dari bbrp bulan lalu dan katanya seampuh ini
4182 2018-04-09 16:21:28 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

4189 2018-04-09 16:21:04 Justin Trudeau is just a weak "play boy" in front of the oil companies, and saddly North America is becoming a "petroleum colony"
4190 2018-04-09 16:20:57 I was frequently paying an English based agency that UKTI were promoting to do oil and gas shows where often 70% of the company’s were from scotland.
You also had to pay this agency thousands each year to get access to their data gathered.
It was a rip off
4191 2018-04-09 16:20:52 If #Oil #Pipelines Didnt always leak&spill=No 1 would have a problem with them.

4194 2018-04-09 16:20:32 A little google searching has revealed fish oil apparently actually increases anxiety for some people. I did not know that. :/
4195 2018-04-09 16:20:30 They would have given service vouchers worth the amount. I dunno. Or free engine oil..

4201 2018-04-09 16:20:07 I think I may have at least figured out why my anxiety is through the roof today, although I'm pretty disappointed if this is the cause. I just started taking fish oil as a supplement to kind of tide me over until my psych appointment.

4203 2018-04-09 16:20:01 I think I may have at least figured out why my anxiety is through the roof today, although I'm pretty disappointed if this is the cause. At the recommendation of my therapist, I just started taking fish oil as a supplement to kind of tide me over until my psych appointment.
4204 2018-04-09 16:20:00 Sure I have too,I've actually seen an artist recently documented on CNN and had displays as a prestigious Art gallery in new York he also worked oil paintings, it was glorious, even for a novice like me who knows little about Art
4205 2018-04-09 16:19:53 Usually writers praised for their psychological depth paint subtle shades of feeling. Dostoevsky is over the top with shouting, laughter, tears, blows, sex, death — grubby venality shining like an oil slick on a mud puddle, grace shooting up like a flower from a dung hill.

4207 2018-04-09 16:19:45 Lol for real...like there was nooo tread, wires coming out... probably should get my oil changed while I'm being lucky
4208 2018-04-09 16:19:33 That's cool. How about you get rid of every oil based product you own (cell phone, car, clothing, laptop, food from the grocery store etc..) then proceed to turn off the natural gas heat to your home and go back to the Stone age.
4209 2018-04-09 16:19:31 Please outline with references the costs associated in producing one barrel of Alberta tarsands bitumen compared to producing one barrel of Bahrain off shore shale tight oil with references. 
TY.
4210 2018-04-09 16:19:29 I need to get a oil change 
4211 2018-04-09 16:19:28 What are you smoking this morning? Do you use oil or byproducts of oil? If yes you need pipelines, plain and simple son.
4212 2018-04-09 16:19:28 I need to do my laundry and get the oil in my car changed but I also just really don’t wanna get up
4213 2018-04-09 16:19:24 whenever i miss erie too much i like to go look at aivazovosky’s oil paintings again because it’s the only seascapes where the water looks appropriately polluted enough to remind me of home.
4214 2018-04-09 16:19:22 for my hair I personally love olive oil a lot better than coconut oil but that’s just me
4215 2018-04-09 16:19:22 Demand = Down. Buyers cannot meet climate targets using AB oil.
4216 2018-04-09 16:19:18 yes i love coconut oil
4217 2018-04-09 16:19:17 @CanRevAgency why does snake oil salesman @JoelOsteen have a registered charity in Canada?
4218 2018-04-09 16:19:12 It’s not the Canadian economy, it’s western Canada’s economy. If the oil sands were in Quebec or Ontario, they’d be supported one million percent.
4219 2018-04-09 16:19:11 Your #TheFutureIsClean tag doesn't jive with your government's insistence in overcoming local and indigenous's people's rights to move foreign-owned dirty tar oil over their land. Just saying #cdnpoli @JustinTrudeau #KinderMorgan

4225 2018-04-09 16:18:47 You can make some solid pasta if you take the tuna mix it with some olive oil, fresh tomatoes, black olives and capers.
4226 2018-04-09 16:18:43 It won't be. Too much hot air, not enough oil.

4228 2018-04-09 16:18:13 I’m not generally excitable about ~future technology~ by I just realized a self driving car could take itself to get an oil change so now I’m all in
4229 2018-04-09 16:18:10 The thing about hurricanes, wars and the rumor of war is that the oil is still there. Oil jumping in light of these things is not a trend. It might even be a point where selling would be in order.

4232 2018-04-09 16:17:58 Apply butter after washing your beard and washing your face. Beard wash twice a week. Oil as needed and particularly in trouble areas. Balm on top of the oil to lock in the badassery. Lip balm is important because chapped lips in a great beard is like a spare tire on a Benz
4233 2018-04-09 16:17:55 So you would be ok with a pipeline going threw your neighborhood and oil in your water NO so don’t even try it that’s rude and disrespectful
4234 2018-04-09 16:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.
4235 2018-04-09 16:17:46 Why do people listen to this quack?
He is another snake oil salesmans... Always first with halftruths... 

Funny thing is most of ya'l would listen to this quack, before listening to Malema about racial divides and land inequalities.
4236 2018-04-09 16:17:43 Excuse me, but Chavez was already in power and our economy socialist when the middle east crisis bumped oil prices to 100+ USD per barrel

4240 2018-04-09 16:16:52 It took a long time to get my hair healthy, but coconut oil and products w no sulfates or parabens
4241 2018-04-09 16:16:49 You have to wonder if the Syrian chemical weapon attack was a Russian effort as retaliation after the Oligarchs were sanctioned. They know the aftermath will destabilize the middle east, driving up oil prices and, as a result, the Russian oil producers will profit.
4242 2018-04-09 16:16:43 Chef Kawasaki cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with cheese.
4243 2018-04-09 16:16:39 Problem is that their networks are just as full as ours.  Even rail is totally full. Oil on rail cars is currently taking up room that could be used by grain farmers. Everyone needs to realize that we are a society that is industrialized. We’re not agrarian any more.
4244 2018-04-09 16:16:39 I swear whenever i get an oil change i feel like my car drives way better 
4245 2018-04-09 16:16:39 It’s just like highways and railroads. Some pipelines are even bi-directional, and can transport different commodities on the same system. Pipelines transport propane, ethylene, butane, light oil, heavy oil, jet fuel, gasoline, water, natural gas and even beer (in Europe).

4247 2018-04-09 16:16:30 Yep.  The same guy who talks about a "tax on everything" that trickles down from the top.  I highly doubt large multi-national oil companies are going to have their shareholders eat the extra costs, rather than pass them on to the consumer in theproducts they sell.

4252 2018-04-09 16:15:37 Waited about two hours @AdamsonFord to find out I needed to make an appointment to run the computer. Took it to @ExpressOil in Mt. Brook. Ran the computer in five minutes. Check engine light on because had 1QT too much oil. Guess who changed the oil a week ago? @AdamsonFord ...
4253 2018-04-09 16:15:35 Great job Mr. President! Don’t let these nay-sayers discourage you! They are miserable with themselves! It’s past time these few squeaky wheels got the oil! Rock on! I’m a soldier and proud to serve you as my Commander-in-Chief!

4257 2018-04-09 16:15:07 We know, we've known forever that Sean Hannity is a hypocrite.  Hypocrites shouldn't be allowed to take advantage of people.  There are laws against snake oil salesmen & the same should apply to the Hannity's of the world who practice fraud.
4258 2018-04-09 16:15:02 How incongruous that POTUS calls for U.S. troops out of Syria then 4 days later, people get gassed. Deep State trying to keep USA in Syria. If Assad is protecting Christians from radical Islamics there, why is he the bad guy? This is more about oil pipeline thru Syria....
4259 2018-04-09 16:15:00 TOMORROW: @laurafriedman43's #AB2828 - prohibits new projects that use oil wastewater to irrigate food crops until the practice has been proven safe - is scheduled for a hearing in the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee

4262 2018-04-09 16:14:41 how would this differ from Norway's investment in oil, for instance?
4263 2018-04-09 16:14:31 So what are they going to do about it? Nothing, because peoples attitudes towards more oil sands production has shifted
4264 2018-04-09 16:14:26 And for an “environmentalist”, you sure trust a big oil company a lot. And maybe some day try to learn about the rest of Canada. Have a great day!
4265 2018-04-09 16:14:26 .@POTUS READ “THE ART OF WAR.” YOU MUST HAVE THE PEOPLE BEHIND YOUR DECISION FOR WAR. AMERICA DOES NOT SUPPORT YOUR FIGHTING FOR ISRAEL’s PIPELINE THROUGH SYRIA TO SELL SYRIA’s OIL THAT ISRAEL IS STEALING! Do you really think America will sacrifice their sons to make Israel rich?
4266 2018-04-09 16:14:21 2 NDP leaders that hate Pipelines and a Liberal Government that put insurmountable obstacles in the oil industry’s way negotiating a pipeline deal. Absurd! #Alberta

4270 2018-04-09 16:13:40 Actually I do prefer facts but every oil project skews the facts. On one hand you have an economist saying that Alberta doesn't need any more pipeline capacity and then you have a discredited report that encourages the pipeline. Where are the real facts?
4271 2018-04-09 16:13:38 also this. yes mood. my trips to get an oil change have improved DRASTICALLY since i stopped being read as female
4272 2018-04-09 16:13:23 tbh, in my fandom like everyone r super duper rich like u guys have own oil wells, and yah it except me lol 
4273 2018-04-09 16:13:16 We are a federation, once the Federal Government has made a ruling we either obey or go to prison. Catering to a mindless few who think that by blocking a pipeline they can stop the use of oil is unacceptable. They are only hurting Canada. Cease and desist at once.
4274 2018-04-09 16:12:58 Corporations do the damage providing products to individuals. It’s called supply and demand. So back to my original comments, if you hate oil and pipelines DONT USE IT
4275 2018-04-09 16:12:57 Yea, but she’s really into this brand Young Living that she’s obsessed. I already bought an oil from her for $40 and it’s tiny af! Their least expensive diffuser is $80ish
4276 2018-04-09 16:12:53 US NAVY have closed the three Stargates in central Syria they are not going to be reopened. 
it wasn't about the oil. 
Theresa May sets up another chemical attack on Syria the Russians told them not to do it. 
But they did!

4278 2018-04-09 16:12:34 america had oil
4279 2018-04-09 16:12:32 .@ScottPruittOK's abuse of privilege is orders of magnitude worse than anything that Tom Price did that got him canned from HHS. But we're numbed by #Trump admin scandals, and the outrageous has become "normal". Will the imperative to cater to Big Oil & destroy the #EPA win out?
4280 2018-04-09 16:12:11 Aww thank you I almost started bathing in Oil of Olay but those words are the best I can hope to hear 
4281 2018-04-09 16:12:05 If you mix it with some hydrating oil, it's nice and dewy 
4282 2018-04-09 16:11:55 Vg?

4288 2018-04-09 16:11:29 He is just another snake oil salesmen/grifter like @realDonaldTrump and his family.
4289 2018-04-09 16:11:28 The worst part is that I’m trying to read and my oil lamp keeps going out!
4290 2018-04-09 16:11:22 Does that mean Hawthorn wood contains resin, an oil, or?
4291 2018-04-09 16:11:21 Electric vehicle can reduce oil import bill of the country...
4292 2018-04-09 16:11:15 Nice! but - that would exacerbate their trade balance with other countries (although one could argue that other countries don't care!). The other issue is, once the market knows China needs to sell 100bln worth of oil, prices may move against them! But clever indeed
4293 2018-04-09 16:11:09 เที่ยวไหนอะรายยย พาแม่มาหาหมอที่ศิริราชอ่ะพี่ออย 
4294 2018-04-09 16:11:05 @potus. IMHO if u want to teach Putin a lesson. Flood the E Europe market with cheap oil & natural gas. Drive Russian economy into a tailspin
4295 2018-04-09 16:11:03 No it isn't. Russia, the US and middle East will all ramp up production to meet demand that would otherwise have been met by oil sands. If you want to lower demand, it needs to be on the demand side not the supply side. This won't reduce world wide demand one iota.
4296 2018-04-09 16:11:00 "Our resorces" (sic). Emmmm! Scottish education? Oor oil? Oor whisky? Oor deficit? Oor divided society? Oor desire to stay in the EU? Oor Barnett formula? What exactly are you talking about?
4297 2018-04-09 16:10:49 Heck, why is beard oil so expensive
4298 2018-04-09 16:10:46 I understand the term. Certainly the risk from fuels transported by rail is an externality. There are many risks from our dependence on oil.
4299 2018-04-09 16:10:42 Its a comeback win in a derby against the league leaders. Let's not discuss what that oil company did to you lot a few times this season, had you managed even a draw in one of those games you'd have celebrated like it was 2004 again 
4300 2018-04-09 16:10:40 I agree with her. The President hasn't done anything for farmers. Took us out of TPP.  Move the point of obligation for ethanol to help oil. Wants  out of NAFTA. His budget calls for massive USDA cuts. And now he picks a trade fight with our 2nd largest customer.  C'mon man.
4301 2018-04-09 16:10:35 Trump ran on keeping the refugees out, then opened his big gob about America pulling out of Syria, letting Assad clearly know of his lack of interest so people died. Putin, who wants the balance of power via oil via Syria tipped in his direction is laughing his ass off
4302 2018-04-09 16:10:26 Putin wants and oil pipeline with a Mediterranean seaport to expand in Syria.
4303 2018-04-09 16:10:16 Ice cream, baby oil, and strawberries
4304 2018-04-09 16:10:14 I can't help bit imagine @Jenna_Marbles and @juliensolomita getting into an actual adult life argument and halfway through julien just bullshitting like he does while playing snake oil.
4305 2018-04-09 16:10:14 I have lost count of how many times I've washed AND dried a load of laundry with a chapstick. Let's see if I can fix these oil stains 
4306 2018-04-09 16:10:12 we thought it'd be more like an oil but it has a gel consistency sadly
4307 2018-04-09 16:10:08 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
4308 2018-04-09 16:09:38 Yes 100%. He started them for oil. Now why did Obama go back?
4309 2018-04-09 16:09:35 Hot grape seed oil is an amazing hot oil treatment wow
4310 2018-04-09 16:09:25 Are you even aware of how much of these pipelines are out there all across the country?

Old, new, it doesn’t matter. The new Bakken oil pipeline in North Dakota spilled oil three times in one week this year.
4311 2018-04-09 16:09:20 #BNEFSummit US Sec of Energy Rick Perry @SecretaryPerry speaking @BloombergNEF on energy & oil production. Trying to innovate to lower carbon emissions & more efficientcy.

4313 2018-04-09 16:09:19 Stop warmongering AP. Would you care to disclose that your owners are illegaly drilling oil in Syria? Self serving false flag you think?
4314 2018-04-09 16:09:17 Putin in its fourth session has $ 200 billion, which, every period after another, creates the wars of oil and gas. The world will not rest until when it neutralizes his evils
4315 2018-04-09 16:09:02 There's a couple very popular Right accounts who are saying "It's not always about oil" when Genie is mentioned. Be weary.
4316 2018-04-09 16:08:56 Scotland was told the oil discovered in the North Sea was of poor quality which was more difficult to refine.

4322 2018-04-09 16:08:45 Zinke is corrupt like the rest of the WH. I'm all for wind power, but selling of public for oil and mining is a travesty.
4323 2018-04-09 16:08:43 Nothing whatsoever to do with human rights. Every nation on Earth trades with every dictatorship that has oil. Ethical oil is an oxymoron.

4333 2018-04-09 16:07:47 oh you have to pretend America is only the USA and that we have never done anything to Brazil. ( when we threatened them because they wanted a modern navy? And oil platforms? ) So yes they have a right to an opinion as much as you do. Sadly most U.S. Opinions R feelings not fact.
4334 2018-04-09 16:07:25 I have nothing to do today other than go get an oil change. But let me tell you. I'm going to shower, do my makeup, BLOWDRY my hair. And look fine af and I'll be feelin myself ALL DAY TODAY. 
4335 2018-04-09 16:07:24 The economy of California is largely driven by tourism. Oil leaks could devastate coastline. This is not rocket science.
4336 2018-04-09 16:07:23 @HamdanMohammed Please ask your father to pay for 40 oil paintings he had promised at Blackheath house & Carlton Tower in presence of John Leats and others.

4337 2018-04-09 16:07:21 @JeepCares I have an 06 Grand Cherokee Loredo and my oil pressure gage drops to zero when I let off the gas but goes back up when pressing the gas. Any ideas?
4338 2018-04-09 16:06:59 @LushLtd hey lovelies, one of your wonderful store staff gave me samples of Celestial and Imperialis - non-oil-based moisturisers for dry skin. I love them both so how do I choose? Do you have any fun facts about them?
4339 2018-04-09 16:06:57 I’m using a new beard oil that’s scented (because literally the only one I could find) and I like the smell (bergamot & cedar) but I’m very conscious that it is scented and it’s weird for me... (1/?)

4343 2018-04-09 16:06:44 What I learned today:
Project Rulison: On Sept 10th, 1969, near the town of Parachute, CO, the Atomic Energy Commission with industrial partner Austral Oil Co, fracked a gas deposit with a 2.5KT nuclear weapon. The gas recovered was unusable due to radioactive tritium isotopes.
4344 2018-04-09 16:06:38 So the job you have in Calgary is in no way affected or influenced by Alberta’s oil industry?

4349 2018-04-09 16:06:03 We agree that more needs to be done for the environment. At the same time, Scott did a good job of managing with the hand we are dealt. The reality is that oil ect. Are efficient forms of energy. You probably drive, use energy, and don’t like freezing in the winter.
4350 2018-04-09 16:05:56 While you were in cabinet, @stephenharper did nothing to assuage the fears of peoples across the country. 

Your treatment of the oil industry with kiddy gloves  is the direct cause of this. 

Also you  all over Indigenous peoples further alienating them.

4352 2018-04-09 16:05:36 The judicial system of India is being gamed by these people, just as it is being exploited and manipulated the world over, funded by oil money from the Middle East and our own blind liberals lead the charge of the usurper against their own. History will be the judge.

4355 2018-04-09 16:05:19 Of course it is Iraqi oil been illegally sold by the Barzani  administration and the revenues went to their pocket even Kurd ppl did not benefit from it
4356 2018-04-09 16:05:12 ISIS was created to spread Propaganda in Libya to justify starting the war in Libya to kill Gaddafi. 70+ tons of gold & chemical weapons gone. ISIS retains Libya & sells the oil to Turkey who sold it to us. Chemical weapons show up in Syria & we start funding ISIS & Al Qaeda?

4360 2018-04-09 16:04:42 I'd say you don't understand the term, the environmental impact is only one factor.  Ask the citizens of Lac Megantic how they feel about transportation more combustible petroleum products.  Transportation of refined fuel or shale oil for instance.

4375 2018-04-09 16:03:04 Moron... Do you know how many people the Oil & Gas business employs? Our money stimulates the economy. Highly unlikely your paycheck from McDonalds would have as big an impact. Just so you can buy cheap gas?  You need an Economy class

4383 2018-04-09 16:02:42 Sorry, wasn't referring to oil but rather the services, if which there were many, that they provided. Not enuff  charachters to enumirate. Had friend involved in some of it. Never illegal but sure skated the edge.

4396 2018-04-09 16:01:47 Almost a drop of oil in my phone
4397 2018-04-09 16:01:40 Why are you trying to advance the oil industry with a roll back?
4398 2018-04-09 16:01:40 So basically blowing up an oil pipeline, causing an oil spill, to protest the environmental damage a pipeline would cause if it broke and spilled?
4399 2018-04-09 16:01:28 1 more:  I’m in the oil business and not the biggest fan of the EPA. Obamas last move was to have us install equip to monitor/report methane emissions at every well/facility. Would have literally put many out of business - just to monitor less methane than what a cow produces.
4400 2018-04-09 16:01:26 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
4401 2018-04-09 16:01:23 *applies tea tree oil on all my problems*
4402 2018-04-09 16:01:08 With all due respect folks! Oil is not the future. What are we doing? The emphasis on oil is mind boggling! Look to the future, not the past. Some countries will soon phase out the use of fossil fuels in automobiles. What will you do then? You will left holding debt
4403 2018-04-09 16:00:54 But about oil, kabila let Angola benefit of our oil.

4406 2018-04-09 16:00:37 This is soo beautiful...America will come for your oil tho!
4407 2018-04-09 16:00:34 RT @MikeHudema: Alberta has averaged 2 oil spills a day for the past 37 years and its pushing for more pipelines. Enough is enough: https:/…
4408 2018-04-09 16:00:26 @BootsUK please do not stock krill oil products. and if you must, make it very clear which these are as i don’t want to use them. thanks.
4409 2018-04-09 16:00:24 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
4410 2018-04-09 16:00:16 Worry about Alberta. Try to multitask away from just oil. You seem like a one trick pony.
4411 2018-04-09 16:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

4415 2018-04-09 15:59:41 so proud to have a prime minister who's NOT AFRAID to stand up for our country's deeply held values:

1. oil
2. shooting unarmed protestors
3. also journalists
4416 2018-04-09 15:59:38 I got everything on my grocery list except flicking olive oil
4417 2018-04-09 15:59:26 The blue one, with sea weed. Aaaand Sex bomb is one of my faves too and thr galaxy one.

I also really enjoy their bath oil balls, the small ones.

4418 2018-04-09 15:59:26 No it isn't. There are plenty of ways to make a living and we need to start transitioning to a low carbon economy now.  

Oil production in Canada is already accelerating at an irresponsible rate.
4419 2018-04-09 15:59:16 Do you also have shares of Genie? Need a regime change to secure your oil?  Dr. Assad has zero reasons to harm his people,while you and your puppetmasters have $millions of reasons.
4420 2018-04-09 15:59:16 I'm afraid the Liar-in-Chief knows what he is doing - playing to his base voters, who, due to ignorance or susceptibility to his snake oil spiel, believe what he says. They are drinking the kool-aid by choice, because they like the crap he's shoveling.

4427 2018-04-09 15:58:19 Mike Nesbitt , yesterday's man has supported the use of violence by British Army right across the world . Usually the only interest Britain has is wealth from Oil Gold & other commodities. For that matter all members of the DUP are similar war mongers
4428 2018-04-09 15:58:18 50回でもまあまあしんどいっすね
4429 2018-04-09 15:58:12 Why does that not surprise me. They are a Tory Govt who don't know their ass from their elbow. I guarantee the oil rich Arabs would have no such trouble.
4430 2018-04-09 15:58:11 I had the Jo Malone bath oil and it smells exactly the same
4431 2018-04-09 15:58:08 I liked Rick Scott better when he was the lead singer of Midnight Oil
4432 2018-04-09 15:58:08 Woke up at 7am just for a oil change #annoyed
4433 2018-04-09 15:58:00 @amgreetings so I was driving in Westlake around 11pm on Saturday night. You must have a lot of people burning the midnight oil cuz every light was on. I’m no environmentalist but seems like a waste of resources for all those lights and no one to use them
4434 2018-04-09 15:57:58 Oil dey ur head
4435 2018-04-09 15:57:36 Every cooking show, ever:

Chef: Add just a touch of oil to the pan 

<adds at least a cup of oil to the pan>
<adds a stick of butter to sauce>
<adds 1 pound of grated cheese to sauce> 

Chef: This healthy, low fat appetizer tastes great!

4437 2018-04-09 15:57:25 Err, not quite. Despite fighting in Iraq for almost a decade, the USA got no oil out of the conflict. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry following the end of the war.
4438 2018-04-09 15:57:23 "But we already put down a deposit."
4439 2018-04-09 15:57:21 They say that we well run dry, it's time that we realize, that we own something worth more than oil and gold
4440 2018-04-09 15:57:19 ...you do realize the pipelines are exporting the oil, right? And if we do end up buying back the end product of what we are exporting we will have to import it...
4441 2018-04-09 15:57:17 Fuck 'em. I hope anyone who voted for him gets screwed over by it. Never felt like this before, but my God, they fucking elected an unstable snake oil salesman.
4442 2018-04-09 15:56:59 Yeah right, thank God we don’t have oil, you guys would have dismantled us piece by piece.
4443 2018-04-09 15:56:53 @realDonaldTrump please see the actual harm that these #tariffs will cause and the damage the @EPA is causing by giving bailouts to oil refineries that have an annual income of $1.5 billion.  Farmers and rural Americans call on you to give your whole nation a brighter future.
4444 2018-04-09 15:56:48 You’re supposed to pour oil in it to get it off. Look it up
4445 2018-04-09 15:56:43 You can try @yb_cbd! They sell an oil for under your tongue that will help! It’s CBD so it won’t get you high but will help you relax!
4446 2018-04-09 15:56:43 #dailygratitudejournal I'm grateful for: supportive colleagues helping with some marking, beautiful sunny days, and oil diffusers.
4447 2018-04-09 15:56:35 Not saying you don’t, but just like with oil and Ag it is time to take a look at what we all can do to the benefit of this state.
4448 2018-04-09 15:56:21 I use Bepanthen for first 5 days or so, then switch to coconut oil. Honestly, keeping it moisturised helps somewhat with itchiness, but.. it's just got to go through that stage stage
4449 2018-04-09 15:56:15 It amazes me how many people buy a 60 thousand dollar truck and then complain about a $55 oil change
4450 2018-04-09 15:56:13 2 fish oil capsules and 2 packs of tuna = some nasty ass burps  #SomeThingIsFishy
4451 2018-04-09 15:56:04 Fasting has gone to take oil 
4452 2018-04-09 15:55:59 Time to start getting dinner on - Lean pork steaks, mashed potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower and gravy.  2 syns for a teaspoon of oil for frying the pork, 4 syns for 2 teaspoons of butter to mash the potatoes 2 syns for a tiny bit of gravy 
4453 2018-04-09 15:55:28 He'd have had nukes by now. Read 'the bomb in my garden' by Iraq's lead nuclear physicist madhi obeidi. Imagine that, 2008 oil prices and the prospect of the psychotic sons powergrab. Anyone who says we'd have been better off with Saddam in place needs their head examining.
4454 2018-04-09 15:55:24 day one of using castor oil and my eyebrows & eyelashes aren’t like vernons yet so i want my money back.
4455 2018-04-09 15:55:24 If you think you were defending the Constitution you’re about 100 years to late. You defended corporate interests and oil, that’s about it.

4474 2018-04-09 15:53:27 I’m waiting for my oil to be changed and I just keep thinking waiting rooms should have something constructive for people to do. Like scanning images of the universe for unusual items or cold case files.
4475 2018-04-09 15:53:27 one of my simplest pleasures in life is water + peppermint oil
4476 2018-04-09 15:53:19 Tell him, Katica. What a poser. He’s as much a loser as his loser fracking queen. Democrat tactics are all about deceit & deception. Liars & phonies. At least when Republicans take money from Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Ag & Wall St. they don’t hide it.
4477 2018-04-09 15:53:12 This is so sad given that the country has the largest oil reserves in the world.
4478 2018-04-09 15:52:56 That’s true. There was not and is not a good solution for the US alone. This would have to be a global effort without oil as a prize.

4482 2018-04-09 15:52:04 Tacos run forever. Just keep up on oil changes, spark plugs and timing belt at 100k and shit like that. Take care of it and it’ll last. That or I’ll sell you the mazdarati

4503 2018-04-09 15:49:53 I have one errand to get done before 12 & it’s taking everything in me to get the ball rolling  but if I don’t get this oil change today I’m sure my car will explode before the week ends.

4512 2018-04-09 15:48:41 you don't need aspirin. we luckily dodged the bullet and managed to not ban coconut oil as the left wanted to do in the 80' & 90's and since we now know coconut oil can cure cancer....

4518 2018-04-09 15:48:17 So 1 to 2 weeks after a pour should be good....lots of plumbing required for their process...I imagine after the hydro hook ups and other operational amenities they gonna be at least 4 months before they can turn on the oil processors....what's you link to RTI

4521 2018-04-09 15:48:02 The problem with making an appointment for an oil change on my day off is that my car will be there forever and i can’t get anything done

4528 2018-04-09 15:47:27 @DOMSEaseOil hey guys. Just want to thank you again for taking my aches away.

You’re getting it right!

4533 2018-04-09 15:46:57 If we go back 40 years many organizations predicted that today we will not have oil, food to the billions population, enough water and many other false “news”. Hope in the future what we “must” not have are false predictions or “scientists” that have fun with absurd “visions”.

4541 2018-04-09 15:45:53 I’ve never met a Canadian activist of any flavour, in the last 50 years, who didn’t have a bitter irrational HATRED for ALL THINGS AMERICAN. But these eco activists inadvertently, have jumped into bed with big American OIL, and they seem to feel no shame! #cdnpoli #bcpoli
4542 2018-04-09 15:45:51 I’m pretty sure that light indicates service is needed, and it’s most likely just an oil change.
4543 2018-04-09 15:45:47 Hypocritical..BC and Canadians opposing this pipeline still want to drive, go boating, buy cell phones, use plastics, cosmetics and a multitude of other products yet it’s ok if the oil comes from somewhere else.

IMF suggests Guyana should rewrite tax laws after 'favorable' XOM deal
Exxon Mobil got such a “favorable” deal from Guyana, home to some recent large oil discoveries (I, II, III), that the South American country shd rewrite its tax laws, the International Monetary Fund says.
4545 2018-04-09 15:45:37 You're obviously not familiar with the concept of economic "rent" and the ability of oil and gas to generate rents. Have a good day.

4605 2018-04-09 15:40:01 So there is no compromise? #Alberta gave up on Northern Gateway, has gone through multiple environmental reviews - but that's not good enough.
Sorry, Alberta, you don't get to compete on the world market because BC is OK with American oil tankers from Alaska, but nothing for Ab.

4616 2018-04-09 15:39:12 They sell the same amount of oil as they buy.  No change in oil price (except maybe some transaction costs).
4617 2018-04-09 15:39:03 When Scheer makes a pronouncement (guns,oil, taxes, reproductive and LGBTQ2 rights) he is speaking on behalf of his moneyed donors.
4618 2018-04-09 15:38:55 The risk exists either way. Oil will be transported to the coast. It's a matter of whether you'd rather it be transported on rail and truck instead of safely via pipeline under the ground.
4619 2018-04-09 15:38:44 Major oil companies are already preparing and are part of the transition. Covering their corporate asses with new renewable assets. I suggest workers get behind their unions and do the same.
4620 2018-04-09 15:38:37 while everyone is distracted the oil folks are quietly having a field day. And the silence is deafening #oilprice
4621 2018-04-09 15:38:10 No it wouldn't. They would sell the exact same amount of oil as they buy.

4636 2018-04-09 15:36:49 i disagree on state and federal level. with all the boom in oil during pdp they ruined the country. imagine if it was pdp that experienced the recession they created, we would be in hell now. if PDP was that good, the country wont be in a mess.
4637 2018-04-09 15:36:43 The other side of the coin is that in the 70s, there was a LOT of money sloshing around in AB and NWT thanks to federal PIP-grants. Wardair ran two Hercs servicing oil exploration in the Arctic. 50 return trips just to remove a rig from Ellef Ringnes Island. /2
4638 2018-04-09 15:36:41 The @Wawa sub I got from the DC store had no vinegar and oil on it or even with it and wasn’t cut in half. That was pretty disappointing yesterday when I opened it on my ride from DC to NJ

4691 2018-04-09 15:31:43 Note to self: bring camellia oil with me when I travel. 

Travel is so drying to hair and skin. I put a little on my hair yesterday and my curls are back. Which makes me happy.
4692 2018-04-09 15:31:35 Naturally, CFIB used spurious numbers to urge more corporate handouts - and wants another Corp tax cut to pay for it.

4693 2018-04-09 15:31:32 Yeah just dump the oil, open the windows and wait. not much else you can do.
4694 2018-04-09 15:31:31 Hmmm have just been invited to a roller disco party.  Just need to get a bit of 3-in-1 oil on the roller skate boots in the garage and I am in.

Come to think of it some of that oil on one or more joints would probably be more fruitful.

4700 2018-04-09 15:30:35 Seems to be that Congress sat on it for a while after passing it for whatever reason. It was only delivered to Trump for signature April 3rd, so he still has plenty of time formally sign it into law if he wants, and pocket veto doesn't seem to be an option after all.
4701 2018-04-09 15:30:33 Elle, 2 things:
1) Oil is everything, it’s money & power. It makes the  go around. If oil is not a “Real” reason for war, there isn’t one. 2) We don’t need ANY oil from Syria! We are now an energy EXPORTER! You R using same worn out line from the 80s BTW, I am against  the war.

We Oil fans have seen many.. the team, nothing crazy for this group, IMO. Guys get traded and see new coaches that way too, and some thrive from that.

Sir, a hotel called “Bowl O China” opposite to rasoolpura metro station is serving really bad food and causing people health problems.I request you to take severe action on such Chinese hotels. Using excess oil etc.

4739 2018-04-09 15:27:34 Sure. Harper had $120 oil. Trudeau inherited a commodities crash. Back then, the US still needed our oil, they've moved drastically toward energy independence since then. Many projects now uneconomic.  Reaching new markets is much greater challenge, that's where Harper failed.
4740 2018-04-09 15:27:30 Stfu calling other fans plastic when you're praising city nobody's excited by second it's just a good improvement from 6th last season what Herrera did on Saturday shows he's passionate about the club and doesn't give a shit about a non-history oil club

4819 2018-04-09 15:18:52 I had a ganglion on my finger for years - often hurt when bumped and easily infected. Doctors said the only fix was surgery.

After research I got pure frankincense oil and wrapped my finger each day in a bandaid with one drop of the oil.  One week later - gone. Never came back.
4820 2018-04-09 15:18:49 It's funny. 10yrs of flux rosters in October, 1yr without... that 1 yr ended up w points that put the oil in playoffs. Who's pulling who's chain still? #tier2couchcoach

Few oil producing regions in the world are as green as Alberta and it oshould be producing more, not less. If you want to stop use of fossil fuels, then target consumers.

4864 2018-04-09 15:15:56 Actually Atiya the heavy Alberta crude is blended in with lighter Mexican crude to produce a blend similar to Saudi oil.  Since the KM pipeline would ship via tanker to US refineries it would indeed displace Saudi oil.

4881 2018-04-09 15:14:16 Agreed with the sentiment! But given Big Oil's history of covering up its own scientists' findings, I'd bet they saw this coming better than anyone. The prob is that consequences for such disasters are still outweighed on purely capitalist ledgers by profits available in between.
4882 2018-04-09 15:14:13 do you loop the cracked oil products back into the system? I don't know how you don't keep it from backing up since oil's limited by the max capacity of the least used resource...
4883 2018-04-09 15:14:09 Muslims are taught to poach other community girls. They think it is part of jihad and Isalam permits them to convert girls forcefully. Muslims are emboldened after oil money.

4893 2018-04-09 15:12:52 The very fact that China has any USD at all, is purely a function of China being more productive than the USA. China doesn't need $ reserves to buy oil. It could have a Yuan that's worth 40% more & accomplish the same thing by just going into the $ market, getting $ to buy oil.

4917 2018-04-09 15:10:37 It's a new pipeline, full of bitumen, not oil- this is a RAIN FOREST AREA - we already endured a 12  hour oil spill with ZERO RESPONSE and you need to increase tankers that  can't fit and all for china and your company doesn't clean up oil  spills.

4929 2018-04-09 15:08:57 Does anybody know where Russia gets their oil
4930 2018-04-09 15:08:54 It is mind boggling that these #idiots don't understand how many $$$$ from oil and gas go into our taxes. You know, the $$$$ that pays for hospitals, schools, roads, education. They will find out the hard way, as these companies and more, flee Canada.
4931 2018-04-09 15:08:52 Remember, EE arose 1) because KXL lost a permit and 2) because oil export demand was growing. If TMX was cancelled, maybe EE re-emerges, but conditions affecting TMX affect EE in spades.

Over 90% of all products shipped in the United States are shipped in corrugated boxes, which totals more than 400 billion square feet of cardboard.

4962 2018-04-09 15:05:33 Luckily there’s a finite amount oil and coal, but we can continue to mass produce animals.. so it’d seem the first problem is self correcting in a sense

4970 2018-04-09 15:05:07 Yes it can, as long as it allows resale of excess Yuan back to it at stable price. EG: Trade Saudi-China
1. Done in Yuan. Sell oil, get yuan, buy chinese goods, spend yuan.
2. Positive balance of yuan? sell it back to PBOC.

4988 2018-04-09 15:03:37  it feels good to roll around in bed, I gotta take my car in for an oil change but it's my day off and I wanna be lazy. #APerfectDayFor #BeingLazy
4989 2018-04-09 15:03:34 Let us not forget that France  was one of the nations that supported the FSA earlier when the crisis was in an infant stage training and helping the terrorists to steal OIL through Turkey to sell in a black market
4990 2018-04-09 15:03:34 It used to be my go-to oil for hair and skin but I've all-but forgotten about it. Silly, really. It hasn't changed. I've been washing up & my hands are like parchment; rubbed some oil into one & not the other. The hand with the oil is instantly restored.
4991 2018-04-09 15:03:32 At Easter, she made white cupcakes. They were good, but weighed a pound each and stuck to your teeth. She used corn syrup instead of oil for the mix. Thank heavens my uncle and his wife hosted dinner!  her tho. She tries.

4999 2018-04-09 15:02:46 The thing is. UN was not established and most of the world was not involved with conflict that was none of our business. It became our business. Once oil became the key factor. Greed tends to create drama.
5000 2018-04-09 15:02:43 If you're like us, then you love the underdog. Today America's farmers are the underdog taking the fight to Big Oil. @realDonaldTrump & @EPAScottPruitt - keep your promises to American farmers and support the American heartland. #RFSWorks

5008 2018-04-09 15:02:15 I'd forgotten what a brilliant oil jojoba is. It's kind of being side-lined these days by the newer, more exotic oils like argan, baobab, marula and so on. I got a bottle for making beeswax wraps with but I'll be using it on me, too.
5009 2018-04-09 15:02:11 People who use marijuana I'll use it for different reasons & the different ways people use marijuana whether it be smoking it, eating it or putting an oil into a drink they're all very different and all done for different reasons so think before you speak
5010 2018-04-09 15:02:09 Last time I looked up the Saudis were mentioned as an oil rich country living off their oil income...
5011 2018-04-09 15:02:00 Don't doubt it, and it must be like turning round an oil tanker.
5012 2018-04-09 15:02:00 I’m have to check it out my next oil change. Good looking tho

5018 2018-04-09 15:01:23 The government of Maldives has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Debra Messing in a kente cloth wig.
5019 2018-04-09 15:01:20 You must be happy with a flat earth from which to extract endless oil
5020 2018-04-09 15:01:15 It's a good thing you feel Canada is so wealthy it can give up on revenues from the majority of jobs the pipeline puts at risk. Let me guess, oil shill?
5021 2018-04-09 15:01:14 USA NOW WANTS PEACE AFTER DRAINING SYRIA OF ALL ITS OIL !
5022 2018-04-09 15:01:07 Engine oil this guy no correct o 
5023 2018-04-09 15:01:03 Nothing. He doesn’t want any of it. Remember he wants to phase out oil. It’s perfect  he won’t be blamed. It’s never his fault.
5024 2018-04-09 15:00:55 your shame tastes like engine oil
5025 2018-04-09 15:00:52 How about the half million Canadians employed by oil sands activity? Or the farmers that can't move their product because railways are over capacity?
5026 2018-04-09 15:00:46 @GovMaryFallin I'm tired of being awakened by these earthquakes brought on by waste water injection wells.  Do something to stop this process.  Our homes are at stake here.  Quit cow toeing to the oil industry and listen to the people that voted for you.
5027 2018-04-09 15:00:46 Why are we shipping oil out of the country anyway? Refine it here! #valueadded Same with logs! We ship this stuff offshore for processing then buy it back and leave the profits offshore.
5028 2018-04-09 15:00:45 Hahaha just secretly throw away the oil in one of the jars xD
5029 2018-04-09 15:00:41 Unfortunately, where foreign policy in relation to the Middle East is concerned, alliances are & have been for at least the last century governed by who supplies whom with oil. Humanitarian concerns come a poor second to business interests.
5030 2018-04-09 15:00:35 And here we sit, with our thumbs up our azz drilling and spilling oil. Smh

5042 2018-04-09 14:59:50 Love how The Boston media bashed the TB12 method and called Brady a snake oil salesman when it fit their narrative then turn around and bash The Pats and BB for not using it. When the dynasty ends and the Pats go back to 8-8 you will all be out of jobs.
5043 2018-04-09 14:59:48 I think that's what beard oil is for. You rub it into the beard to change the face underneath it.

5045 2018-04-09 14:59:31 Canada could stop oil+gas, we could stop driving... we could stop breathing ... we wouldl make NO diff, none whatsoever, to world GHG's.  > 1) Focus on immediate elimination of coal pwr, 2) add Import tax to foreign oil and 3) incentivize long term reduction in Nat Gas pwr ...
5046 2018-04-09 14:59:31 I would be very nervous holding long meal, short oil into tomorrows report. That trade getting very stretched and even a bullish Argentine number may not hold it.

5050 2018-04-09 14:58:58 The fed .govt. should push for the energy east option for Alberta's oil.....many more jobs with Canadian steel to a willing refinery, for self sufficiency...We are all responsible for OUR Pacific  marine renewable resources....
5051 2018-04-09 14:58:57 You likely could have found Jojoba at HEB, Whole Foods, any health place like Vitamin Shoppe, etc. Never heard of having to use oil for stretching. I never did when I had mine before.
5052 2018-04-09 14:58:39 Again fakenews, conspiracy theorist BS, maybe the only place were they fly their drones is the golan heights, which is Syrian and was stolen fyi by Israel, they simply took it from Syria, a lot of oil in that region.

5064 2018-04-09 14:57:25 It should be a wake up call to all Conservatives in general, not just oil&gas. Collectivism runs rampant in Canada, the rule of law has broken down, our governments are working on behalf of foreign interests and not the interests of Canadians anymore.

In the meantime, Jason, are you going to call for permits being yanked that allow oil to flow to BC from Alberta? @allnews2nite

5239 2018-04-09 14:39:32 there are alternative sources out there. I guess it depends on where you stand re: the environment as to whether you think  wastewater subsidies or alternative fuels are any better than oil.

5250 2018-04-09 14:38:49 That would be nice if it were true. Unfortunately they have just printed money to pay for the oil. That’s rapidly coming to an end finally as US becomes energy independent.

5265 2018-04-09 14:37:29 No. It's a false flag. We're tired of these transparent tricks. Let them have the oil fields.
5266 2018-04-09 14:37:23 Annual average U.S. crude oil production reached 9.3 MMbpd in 2017 (+464,000 bpd from 2016 levels) < in Nov. 2017 monthly U.S. crude oil production reached 10.07 MMbpd, the highest monthly level of crude oil production in U.S. history #Oil #USA #business #economics

Then you cut taxes for the wealthy and what happens? Oil & Gas was an empty promise & no for education.

5409 2018-04-09 14:24:13 The premium is the price received relative to Brent at the refinery gate due to lower sulfur content. Also, a less complex refining fleet in Europe is a good fit for lighter crude grades after the 2020 IMO bunker fuel spec change as they produce very little high sulfur fuel oil.

5411 2018-04-09 14:24:04 How has the government mistreated AB?

An economy so reliant on oil is not stable (or on house sales, or any other single industry, etc). What happens when it crashes again? We should be investing more in other industries and energies at the same time.

5448 2018-04-09 14:21:05 Can't build refineries in Canada due to the carbon footprint? So we ship our oil to China to be refined there and then ship it back to Canada. Refining in China produces the identical amount of CO2. And China gets the profits and the jobs. THAT is called Climate Progress.

5450 2018-04-09 14:20:48 Yes it does pollute a certain amount, but there are bacteria that do break down heavy oil (bitumen).  It is a slow process but it does work.  As far as chemicals go for cleanup, orange products work good because they are natural and there are many others.

I also feel like if the collective we actually care about the environment as much as we pretend we need to change Big Oil in general. We don't want to change our life styles.
5499 2018-04-09 14:16:38 Re: Kinder Morgan
Interesting that the same group which states we have the technology to replace fossil fuels states that we do not have the technology to move crude oil safely through a pipeline.

5502 2018-04-09 14:16:12 Will Trump's #TradeWar help to fight #climatechange? According to @FGEnergy, a 1% reduction in global trade growth would curb oil demand growth in 150 kb/d. As each barrel contains 0.43 tonns of CO2 (EPA), we would avoid the emission of 64,500 CO2 tonnes per day.Thank you Donald!
5503 2018-04-09 14:16:06 Do you take your car in to get the oil changed & then decide you need new wipers - I guess u think the wipers should be free right?

5638 2018-04-09 14:02:19 Well not necessarily. We could drop to part time and as soon as promotion was achieved we could go full time. There have been a few who have done that. Cost cutting has to start somewhere I guess. Raj isn't an oil rich tycoon.
5639 2018-04-09 14:02:07 It's quite bizarre to watch Calgary morning news these days.

CAPP (Canadian Association of Oil Producers) is praising a Prime Minister named Trudeau and urging him to use his "federal authority" to force a western province (BC) to bend to his wishes on a national energy policy.
5640 2018-04-09 14:01:57 Always wanted to ask. Do you think the UWF would have been hugely successful if the Oil bust hadn't decimated the territory?

5646 2018-04-09 14:01:30 I think we're allowed to have something in the center of ours and if so I am so inspired now. I want to put one on the underside of the trunk in the corner for every time I go in for oil changes.

5653 2018-04-09 14:00:37 They will just move more of it by rail and transport truck, bullish for oil as it just consumes even more oil transporting it this way instead of pipeline. Pipelines are the most efficient, but not the only way to move product.
5654 2018-04-09 14:00:35 I normally don't do these....but your MCM is letting nixxaz check his oil in the yard over in Max...

5665 2018-04-09 13:59:00 Where are the Peak Oil negatoids these days?
5666 2018-04-09 13:58:55 @ed1950 It is time for citizens and  #oil & #gas industries to put another plan on a plank.  Polite is not effective.
5667 2018-04-09 13:58:52 Thank you, Avey.  I don't need the source.

Pipelines are not for now, they are for decades to come.  Once built, there is a strong impetus to keep them full.  Demand isn't fixed, it's altered by supply and price.  The more oil infrastructure we build, the longer the transition.

5672 2018-04-09 13:58:26 Oddly enough, the increased oil shipments planned in KinderMorgan are not going to BC. It's all exported. The Energy East pipeline would have seen some Bitumen refined in Canada and increased the supply of Canadian oil in Canada.

5678 2018-04-09 13:57:05 Check d gradual increase in external reserve and the oil price at that time and compared to when oil price was extremely high. Tabulate it
5679 2018-04-09 13:57:05 personally i love the shea moisture manuka honey hair mask so i’d definitely recommend that one! for homemade, i always do a mix of aloe vera, castor oil, and coconut oil. that one adds shine too and it’s cheap 
5680 2018-04-09 13:57:03 I do love a butter coffee with some MCT oil , get those brain cells firing :)
5681 2018-04-09 13:57:03 Not to be a hater but I’m pretty sure I can make a dupe for body lava with an oil and highlight I have laying around. The texture is very nice though
5682 2018-04-09 13:56:54 Curious as to what the Estée Lauder bronze goddess shimmery oil looks like. Prob similar to this body shop one and almost the same packaging. I just love the scent of the EL. What’s this smell like?
5683 2018-04-09 13:56:48 When a thirsty nigga pay for your oil change...cuz he thirsty....so you go buy yourself some ice cream since you saved some money

5687 2018-04-09 13:55:49 At that time, it was quite a feat considering average oil price throughout his admin was <$35. GEJ plundered reserves in more ways than the layman can comprehend. PMB has raised debt levels to increase reserves...we are the ones that need to demonstrate we can’t be hoodwinked

5689 2018-04-09 13:55:47 The CDC hasn't banned Cod Liver Oil?
5690 2018-04-09 13:55:24 Btw, I knew about Mille watches when you were shitting in your fake Pampers. We knew about expensive stuff before there was oil in our backyard.

2 things you can't buy: 

Style and brain.
5691 2018-04-09 13:55:22 Red wine + dried herring in olive oil + salsa + Gouda + dark chocolate + macadamia while watching movies at home. Whoever said life's pleasures have to be expensive is a fool!
5692 2018-04-09 13:55:19 Well then you better get off your phone and return almost everything inside your home as well as any mode of transportation you have as this is all because of the oil industry. Reduce your usage and there won't be a need for oil #TrudeauMustGo #KinderMorgan
5693 2018-04-09 13:55:19 Maybe not. Mismanagement of Venezuela's PDVSA means that oil output in that country is declining and will continue to do so. The rest of OPEC can not bother with cuts.

5700 2018-04-09 13:54:01 Luckily you dont use any oil...right?
5701 2018-04-09 13:53:54 That’s it spot on Mark he’s a know it all, he won’t see anything from anyone else’s side or position. He knows about how the TXE works, big deal, most drivers don’t even know how to put oil in, but you can still have a civil debate with them !
5702 2018-04-09 13:53:47 Yep, shame on all the yes-voters (including Heitkamp and Manchin), and especially on Republicans for shooting down the motion to delay his confirmation vote until the batch of email correspondence between Pruitt and oil/coal companies could be reviewed.
5703 2018-04-09 13:53:39 He is a glorified snake oil salesman. I can’t believe anyone would listen to his nonsense, let alone pay for it.
5704 2018-04-09 13:53:32 I forgot I hotboxed yesterday & the guy changing my oil was like “ayyy you smoke?” LMAO
5705 2018-04-09 13:53:26 They don’t because there’s no oil or enough resistance there that they could wage a war and make money from....  They wouldn’t want to look like bullies and baby killers... It’s all about the PR and money.

5709 2018-04-09 13:53:08 Has anybody asked why @EPAScottPruitt is granting "hardship" waivers to ANY oil company? #ethanol is cheaper than gasoline.  NO oil company can say it's causing economic hardship. Consumers are helped! Farmers are facing hardship today. Help @realDonaldTrump #RFSWorks

5714 2018-04-09 13:52:45 It isn’t about a company! It’s about the right to export.  I guess you prefer to keep importing oil from countries other than your own who don’t care a less about your values!

gotta try Nova, although her design seems super bland imo
5719 2018-04-09 13:52:10 We have learned that, prosperity is not steel, it’s not oil, it’s not even roads, rail, or infrastructure. Those are simply static manifestations of prosperity. Prosperity is a continuous commitment to innovation. It is a process, not an event; a journey, not a destination.

5729 2018-04-09 13:51:46 The other side: I wear swim shirts over my swimsuit & a floppy hat at the beach. Why? Allergic reaction to sunburn & too many friends w/skin cancer. I'm of the generation when girls baked outside w/baby oil to tan! A little sun is great, but I wish 16y/o me used a sun umbrella.
5730 2018-04-09 13:51:44 @POTUS stop letting @EPAScottPruitt make back room deals for his oil buddies. Let the #RFSwork
5731 2018-04-09 13:51:35 Mix egg, coconut oil and peppermint oil. Leave it for about an hour then wash it. It does wonders
5732 2018-04-09 13:51:11 Global oil demand will not decrease in our lifetimes, it will grow by 1.4-1.6% from 2017 to 2018 and is showing no signs of slowing down. If you value the prosperity of , you should support this project.

5734 2018-04-09 13:51:03 Sure, I have a Xinwang Dagu, takes leaded gas and gutter oil in the crankcase and gets 7mpg. The blue exhaust looks sporty.
5735 2018-04-09 13:50:54 Unfortunately most people cannot afford a Tesla. And the oil men are not impressed by anyone edging them out of their cash cow. Need a rethink on the public benefits of letting a few people access mineral rights.

5749 2018-04-09 13:49:53 I have an idea. Those who want oil can move to one area of the country where they frack so they can experience the joys of contaminated water tables and soil. See who lasts longer.
5750 2018-04-09 13:49:51 You run the Dept. Of Education and are not on the side of teachers? You blame us for asking for the bare minimum? These strikes are NOT our fault.

5766 2018-04-09 13:47:36 Oil. Its all about the oil. Whoever has it, becomes a target. There was no ISIS until the US *invaded* and plundered the resources of the middle east. Again. Now they've kicked a hornet's nest, what did they expect?

End rant. Lol.
5767 2018-04-09 13:47:23 I'm having a reasonably good day today the sun is shing here in Wales and I've covered myself in lemon oil while drinking a chamomile and spearmint tea 
5768 2018-04-09 13:47:22 Lisa gas prices are going up because of the cost of oil. The gas tax is a fixed per gallon cost. 
If CA is so bad the answer this why is it the 6th largest economy in the world and growing at 2x the rate of the rest of the country.
Pot is legal just like elsewhere

5771 2018-04-09 13:47:01 Haven’t been sleeping well this week. Thinking it could be that I’m not using magnesium oil (though I did increase my mag glycinate) or that I’ve been out of DIM detox & CBD oil for a week. #chronicillness #spoonie

5784 2018-04-09 13:44:59 They can sell people coffee while they wait - I think a barrel of Starbucks coffee costs more than a barrel of oil.
5785 2018-04-09 13:44:56 Notley just lost the next election. Albertans will never forgive Alberta NDP for lack of response to BC’s NDP. One wonders if Notleys crew only paid pipeline lip service in order to gain jobs with BC’s NDP after loosing the election. One of her inner circle is a strong oil critic
5786 2018-04-09 13:44:53 my skin isnt sensitive but i been careful anyway bc i didnt know how much was too much. i been doing after shower oil then glytone then body butter only at night. but its safe to use exfoliating lotions twice a day?
5787 2018-04-09 13:44:45 i love thinking about how so many people suffered due to the american govt’s greed over oil and money and power! amazing! make america great again!
5788 2018-04-09 13:44:44 God gives us beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness (see Isaiah 61: 3). God gives us whatever we need to be victorious. Because He enables us, we credit Him for all the good things in our lives.
5789 2018-04-09 13:44:25 #TwitterArguments: We have to loosen our dependence on fossil fuels and oil, and make a plan to save our planet BUT scream bloody murder when a province/indigenous people stop an oil pipeline from crossing it's territory. We can't have both. #cdnpoli #cdnmedia
5790 2018-04-09 13:44:25 As my recent Drive West to East through I-40 demonstrated even the oil patch understands that when the wind blows take advantage of it.  Banks of 30 - >200 turbines for hundreds of miles with power lines heading south to Austin & San Antonio.
5791 2018-04-09 13:44:24 If your club has Messi, run by single team in the league or has oil money to spend billions, then go for any1 but Pep will be best.

5803 2018-04-09 13:43:51 Pretty clear that prairie provinces need a reliable port, not just for oil and gas but for all industries. Can’t count on access to existing ports. Wonder if Alaska would work with Canada again?

5817 2018-04-09 13:42:13 Yes. But even David Lewis felt nationalization of Canada's oil and gas industry was a no-go zone. After the 1972 crisis, it would have made sense. Lougheed used the issue to consolidate power and PET gave up, unable to convince either QC or the West. History brought us here.

5826 2018-04-09 13:41:36 I agree. Gov will take full advantage.   The sooner we get the cross country recharge stations installed for electric vehicles the better.  Always disagreed with the unpredictable price increases unilaterally imposed by oil companies.

5887 2018-04-09 13:33:23 I’m 4th generation independent oil producer. I welcome expansion to other sources of energy BUT none can/will replace fossil fuels. US has abundant  recoverable reserves. You can’t just stop using fossil fuels & expect to survive. Easier said than done.

5889 2018-04-09 13:33:07 Wind energy gets 1/10th the credits, rebates, and tax relief that oil and gas receive.  The attack on renewables we’re seeing now is crazy. Why, oh why, does Oklahoma keep insisting on going backward?

5915 2018-04-09 13:29:50 It's no different than here. The perception that Republicans are the only ones in Congress manipulated by oil interests is a false one. Heitkamp, Clinton, Landrieu and others have been among Oil's happiest recipients. I'm sure it's no different there.

5951 2018-04-09 13:25:20 It’s imperative that we transport our resources to international markets, and pipelines are objectively the safest way to transport oil. Adopting a pragmatic, fact-based approach to the issue isn’t just good politics, it’s also the right way to go about it.

5957 2018-04-09 13:24:33 One of the most shameful times the country has seen. Most folks tucked their tails between their legs and stood in ques placing their trust in a snake oil salesman. Same way they are ready to swallow the Blue Pill of Aadhaar, about to sign their freedom away.

6102 2018-04-09 13:10:10 Jobs are being lost in Canadian oil because the differential between WTI and Canadian oil is so high. Lack of transport capacity is creating a massive discount on Canadian oil. 

This reduces the tax base, first, and then creates layoffs and bankruptcies.

6166 2018-04-09 13:02:29 Actually it isn’t, because the nations that would have bought Canadian oil, where rule of law and government oversight can provide environmental safeguards, will simply by if from somewhere else, possibly a nation that couldn’t care less about the environment or human rights.

6199 2018-04-09 12:59:27 It’s either that or they have to get oils instead and...oil up their bones with it.

6234 2018-04-09 12:54:33 Crude oil prices also saw carry-over pressure from Wed's EIA report showing that U.S. oil production rose by +0.3% w/w to a new record high. Friday's Baker Hughes report was bearish since it showed that the number of active oil rigs jumped by 11 rigs to a 3-year high of 808 rigs.

6241 2018-04-09 12:53:55 I had a read last night after you mentioned Genie. It all make sense. Saying that, Golan Heights is a water source for Isreal so regardless of the oil it’s worth keeping in a sun ravaged country. But yes, that black gold makes even more important.

When I cook green cabbage, I sauté it in olive oil with sliced leek, root ginger, garlic, & lemon juice: then add a little butter/sour cream before serving.
Lemon & ginger tea is not unpalatable & quite good for my colitis too

You should definitely listen to this great podcast. @ttmygh clears that right up...

This has more to do with currencies and flow of goods (and oil, yes priced and purchased in yuan). Gold is just one of the byproducts in this dance.

Ahh, here we are again with the "corporations will regulate themselves magically" thesis.
How does it work out when we allow extractive industries police themselves?
If data is the new oil (debatable notion), is it not just the new extraction needing regulation?

The looting of public lands for oil and gas and land developers. the crippling of key functions of the govt that protect vulnerable from the rich greedy.

6449 2018-04-09 12:31:41 Wonderful in principal, far trickier when you are the PM for the entire country and you have Alberta with substantial number of jobs dependent on oil and gas resources. As PM what should he suggest - that they move?

6452 2018-04-09 12:31:24 I have really dry skin so I wash my face with soap/water then apply it and leave it on all night & by morning it's completely absorbed into my skin.. some days I wash it in the am and put the oil on it as well.. my make up looks fine over top of the coconut oil..

6456 2018-04-09 12:30:56 It’s gotten to be commonplace here. We don’t expect them to be life threatening; although they are damaging. It’s the earth complaining because our oil/gas industry is injecting saltwater deep into the earth after its been used to extract resources.
6457 2018-04-09 12:30:53 The problem with the "war for oil" thesis re: #IraqWar is that for a small fraction of the cost of the war, US Gov't could have paid to redo the oil contracts in Iraq.

6469 2018-04-09 12:29:58 and don't misinterpret what i say....the banking world has no ability to offset the fact that long Oil will win, other than being long themselves...those 29 million new drivers in China this year alone are more real than the backwardation.
6470 2018-04-09 12:29:57 Wrong.  It’s actually art and culture as you say that’s at about 2%.  Don’t get me wrong - I love art and am a collector.  But when you add up what comes from oil and gas, and the uptick from the business it creates (refining, manufacturing) art does not compare.
6471 2018-04-09 12:29:57 Olive oil has lots of "fake virgins" also.
6472 2018-04-09 12:29:55 I had mild TBI from getting hit by that double-tanker oil truck in 2016. I had continuing short-term memory issues, etc. No access to oil until recently and now I can remember that I just took my vitamins, instead of not remembering, etc. I'm about 100% now due to cannabis oil.

6477 2018-04-09 12:29:29 So would investing in technologies like wave, gravity, photosynthesis, solar, wind, & geothermal.

6494 2018-04-09 12:28:13 @ReelHannah Palm Oil itself isn’t poisonous to dogs. There were a couple of articles a few years back were dogs were eating palm oil off beaches and becoming ill. However this was generally because the palm oil had been washed up by big ships and as such becomes toxic to dogs 1/2

AFTER US says they r supposedly leaving Syria?Asaad family has been in power so many years & all of a sudden, he becomes a ruthless dictator? is main goal 2 get to Syria oil & gas? Anyone remember the TR recording?
6593 2018-04-09 12:16:50 The loss of our environment is too high a price for oil.
6594 2018-04-09 12:16:43 Still won’t change the situation that #okleg put us in. Tax on wells and tax on disposal is the same thing. You can’t get oil out of the ground without waste water going back in.
6595 2018-04-09 12:16:41 I don't agree. There's no "different scenario" - just a continuation of ongoing US support to Israeli / Wahhabist agendas & their proxies in order to protect oil interests & petro-currency. Assad opted for the wrong pipeline.
You could say Assad / Russia could prove otherwise...

2. Like you said, we already steal enough oil from the other countries we invaded, that’s where the money comes from.

6727 2018-04-09 12:01:58 Resource control and regional autonomy are the key to reducing corruption in Nigeria.

Not only is cotton an efficient water user, it offers one unique advantage: It provides both food and fibre. Cottonseed accounts for 2/3 of a harvest's weight and is used to make an edible oil and animal feed. No other agricultural crop can say that!

6800 2018-04-09 11:51:40 Malfeasance is the offence.  Knowing imposition of regressive subsidies on the fact by law, that can only make each claimed problem expensively worse in engineering fact.

The changeover in Line 9 taking oil west to east was also approved.

6904 2018-04-09 11:38:47 The US is being manipulated into a war against Assad on behalf of Israel. It's an oil war. Syria has the proper claim to the Golan Heights Cf. Genie Energy. Also this is the Oded Yinon plan. IS are mostly radicalised muslims, but they are a proxy army headed by Mossad/CIA/MI6.
6905 2018-04-09 11:38:32 A friend’s family formally owned an oil company in Toronto; they delivered oil to homes when oil furnaces were a thing.

I remember their Dad questioning why gas prices fluctuated at gas stations when it didn’t for him to purchase. Essentially oil pricing is a capitalist’s design

6930 2018-04-09 11:35:42 We are indeed driving on oil from Saudi and propping up their misogynistic regime as well as others, some worse, thanks to our government's failure to build the refineries and pipelines needed to use our own resources.

6933 2018-04-09 11:35:19 You need power for those things, which you can get many other ways than oil. There are literally oil/coal power free countries in Europe already. This has nothing to do with keeping your lights on and everything to do with rich people getting richer.
6934 2018-04-09 11:35:19 I understand you’re argument. However what good are all these (temporary) jobs, and oil dollars if our children won’t even be able to breath the air in 50 years? We are way off all our emissions targets and have been for many years.

6997 2018-04-09 11:25:44 Portes is selling the continuous growth with compound mass immigration to support it invisible snake oil. He must be either catastrophically dumb or hopes he will be dead by the time the whole ponzi scheme explodes and he is exposed.
6998 2018-04-09 11:25:39 Claims to treat multiple unrelated maladies.
Sure fire snake oil red flag. Just admit it. You’re an idle stoner.
6999 2018-04-09 11:25:38 If we refined our own oil, we wouldn't have to get it to market for export. We can use existing pipelines and transport currently in place, and stop importing Saudi's oil. Prices for oil are low. And how about we seriously look at alternatives to tar sands? Because it's 2018.

7001 2018-04-09 11:25:23 Then set an example stop using all products and energy produced from oil. You are hypocrite, either paid for by foreign interests or delusional.

Wake up life by your beliefs stop using oil.
7002 2018-04-09 11:25:19 Further to the argument, if Canada needs oil, why are we shipping it offshore?  Shouldn’t we refine it ourselves for domestic use?
7003 2018-04-09 11:25:09 she has spent her whole time as premier shutting down the oil industry along with about every other industry in Alberta,  now its coming up to election time she is pretending to care about the people of Alberta?  a skunk does not change its stripes.

7035 2018-04-09 11:20:56 Do not know the answer, but it seems that the government decides where to intervene based on secondary interests (resources such as oil etc). 
The bigger question is on the UN as collaborative effort and why they do not intervene - they have funds from US + many other nations...

7138 2018-04-09 11:09:14 How is it possible that we can sell oil cheaper to other countries and it is expensive to consumers in #Canada- we produce it?!

What Kinder Morgan is doing benefits Texas oil executives- not #Canadians.  In fact, harm has been done.

I think about #Canadian companies/organizations wanting to ‘own’:
Amazon Forest fresh water
Africa resource rich minerals
and what we do to get this.
The effect on the people & land is devastating.

Oil is not the only way

7204 2018-04-09 11:00:38 mmmmm it assumes agreement can be reached, from what I can see regulation is used when agreement can't be reached. EG BP would drill for oil anywhere if regulation didn't protect our marine parks

7254 2018-04-09 10:52:30 You have countries in the world producing oil without issue and growing their economies.  In Canada they are hamstrung and cannot get their product out and help the Canadian economy.  The govt cannot rely on taxation alone unless you like to see your taxes keep going up...

7261 2018-04-09 10:51:25 concept that if you are guilty of using oil you can’t protest the tar sands or fracking is simple and dumb, a simpletons argument. Using oil is not a choice, it’s been forced on us, it’s the world we live in. To try for better is not hippocritical it’s only responsible action.

7299 2018-04-09 10:44:45 You'd know that the tariffs hurt the oil to industry too if you would bother to learn an iota of what it actually does.
7300 2018-04-09 10:44:43 The value of this project is critical for the economy. Canada is already crumbling. Canada has the safest oil sands and one of the lowest carbon emitters in the world. Canada's global impact is minuscule vs China, vs USA. Stupid to not build this.
7301 2018-04-09 10:44:34 So is there a fight on to stop tankers on the oceans full of it? Rail cars full of it? Trucks full of it?  Reduce the uses of it rather than focus on the transportation of it...  oil is not only used for planes trains and automobiles, we make plastics with it, lubricants...

7303 2018-04-09 10:43:51 Exactly & government shouldn't have to foot the bill for rapid response, which we don't even have now, successive provincial governments left it to the feds & "drill, baby, drill" CPC did squat, closed Kits Coast Guard Station FFS & can we trust the oil industry to do it? Nope.
7304 2018-04-09 10:43:46 I’ve been experimenting with skincare and here’s my verdict. Oil cleansing does wonders for whitehead. Get a good toner, for gentle exfoliation and moisturising. Never skip moisturiser. My skin texture is SO much better now

7336 2018-04-09 10:38:22 It talked about deep water drilling and fracking decades before they became commonplace. The thing it really hit on was that the demand for energy would continue to increase, and the possible ways to use new techniques alongside oil and gas to meet those needs.
7337 2018-04-09 10:37:27 The problem is, no matter what they promise, the fossile fuel industry has a long history of hiding and covering up oil spills. Usually the public ends up paying for the clean up. None of the protesters are going to believe them.

7531 2018-04-09 09:52:36 No it won’t. The people are rising up! Big Oil’s time is up. Stop exporting  raw oil and logs, refine them in . Sell the gas in . If too much 4  market stop drilling and fracking. Stop mining the tar sands or burn the stuff for electricity. Build a national grid
7532 2018-04-09 09:52:34 Not a very good example, Jimmy. Natural rubber has not been used in tires since WWII. Styrene butadiene and other oil based compounds were invented, using a resource that originates back to the dinosaurs.

7545 2018-04-09 09:51:06 They're easy to tackle, if there's will. Just tax shipping. And also forbid the shipping of all products that are imported because the delocalized production is cheaper due to worse environmental regulation. (Palm oil anyone?)

7558 2018-04-09 09:48:14 Easy & tasty! Boil a pot of water with a pinch or two of salt, simmer octopus for 45-60 minutes. Then in the same water boil peeled & diced pieces of potatoes. Cut octopus into bite size pieces and arrange on a plate with potatoes. Sprinkle with sea salt, pimienton, olive oil.

7560 2018-04-09 09:48:06 Dear @tedlieu Please stop using swamps as a metaphor for bad places with monsters. Swamps give back to the environment. Oil fields would be a better descriptor for those who suck public resources & leave behind destruction. Thanks for listening!
7561 2018-04-09 09:48:04 Pep's tactics have been exposed now everyone knows how to play against them, will be interesting next season when nobody will fear them anymore.

7566 2018-04-09 09:46:48 Why would producers sell oil/commodities for devalued yuan?
7567 2018-04-09 09:46:47 @UBS In view of lower #OPEC supply, new supply risks and stronger demand we have raised our oil price forecasts. We now expect Brent to trade at USD 65/bbl in six months (previously #USD 57/bbl) and USD 62/bbl in 12 months (previously USD 57/bbl). #forex #fx #oil #Brent
7568 2018-04-09 09:46:39 I randomly have two knives on my desk. One is a Swiss Army Knife that I use for such varied things as trimming nose hairs, opening boxes and even once for opening a can of tuna. The other is a folder I use to eat jerky with cause the other knife has some mystery oil on it.

7615 2018-04-09 09:38:28 and the Paris Agreement is not meaningless. It's the only international agreement which requires signatories to take action. That's why the coal and oil sectors are fighting it
7616 2018-04-09 09:38:23 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

7623 2018-04-09 09:37:35 Tony Robbins is a fucking snake oil salesman. That anyone is surprised by his misogyny surprises the hell out of me.
7624 2018-04-09 09:37:26 WHERE IS THE FUCKING OIL YOU UMBRAL BITCH!!?
7625 2018-04-09 09:37:15 Transformers are usually filled with oil, so that would explain the oil slick. It would be possible it was blown off a pole during Irma.
7626 2018-04-09 09:37:02 If they get the part that burns with "fire n sulphur", maybe that means they'll be rich on oil money ? "Sulfur is the third most abundant mineral in the body, about half being concentrated in the muscles, skin and bones, and is essential for life." Sounds like we all need sulphur

7628 2018-04-09 09:36:51 p.s So-called 'Scottish oil money' to rUK & rUK billions to Scotland today is proof that pooling works. The UK can run a massive debt to fund all this, Scotland couldn't. With Scotland's massive deficit (ask Sturgeon) now over £13billion a year we'd be bankrupt in no time.

7710 2018-04-09 09:17:37 Syria's oil and gas resources are tiny. Events in the Middle East are driven by Israeli interests/neocons. Their aim has been to have USA troops engaging Muslims as Israeli proxies. They don't like Trump's plan to remove troops from Syria.
7711 2018-04-09 09:17:34 I remember my geography teacher telling me in 1986 that *all* of Scotland's oil would have been extracted by about 1995-2000.

Since the very first drop was extracted the official line's been "it'll run out in about a decade".

7718 2018-04-09 09:15:11 At the same time, Canada should be working towards a nationalization of our oil and gas industries. Not to increase the amount of oil and gas that we exploit and send abroad, but to help expedite our shift towards renewable forms of energy production.

7738 2018-04-09 09:10:59 Now thats funny!! They both hate oil, deepdown they would rather see the pipeline fail! The ironic part is Trudeaus trust fund was built on his families profiteering from oil. His family was in the oil business
7739 2018-04-09 09:10:46 So another screw-up in the Gulf? Oil fouling the Hamptons? How about Martha's Vineyard? The Chesapeake Bay & up the Potomac? Naval Station Norfolk? Naval Base San Diego?
Obviously the drilling will be done by foreign companies that ignore US laws (e.g., BP).

7776 2018-04-09 09:02:03 I don't believe even entire US GDP could save the ME from inevitable meltdown in the coming decades, as the oil era ends, or save Russia for that matter. The world order of the last 50 years is about to change fundamentally, absolutely. US needs to be highly selective. Triage.

7778 2018-04-09 09:01:27 Pertamina said the disaster has nothing to do with its nearby refinery or undersea   pipelines that run across the bay, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The firm's tests on oil samples found marine fuel oil used for ships, not crude oil, it said.

8117 2018-04-09 07:50:12 I'm sure Scotland is open to ideas. Scotland (GDP: £164B) v New Zealand (GDP: £132B) ?
Scotland can not act like New Zealand. NZ has the full loaf in terms of economic drivers. 
We could also learn from Norway, which amassed a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund from oil.

8136 2018-04-09 07:46:02 This globalist plot to take down Syria and the @Presidency_Sy, and discrediting @PutinRF_Eng for chemical attacks, it's all about control and oil.
The global oligarchy must be worried about the #Awakening. Their court jester @BorisJohnson accuses Russia before the findings!

8213 2018-04-09 07:31:24 Okay, good, I rarely wear it too. The main reason why oily skin gets worse is because a majority of products dry out the skin and your body chemistry is obviously not having it. Lol. So, it produces more oil, which is why things get worse.

8244 2018-04-09 07:23:49 No that would be worse!

Just don’t add a tanker a day with 130,000 tonns of crude oil up and down our coast!
Truck it down!

Truck it from here! That’s fine!
Just don’t add ANOTHER big ass tanker.
8245 2018-04-09 07:23:39 Why would China use FX as a tool. She doesn't need to. And defeats purpose of CNY/oil contract. These people still living in world where US trade with China is significant. It isn't anymore. Now CNY will take own path away from US
8246 2018-04-09 07:23:23 Between the extreme left, and extreme right, little wonder why no one can get along. I hear all these reasons why not, but no one here has offered a solution. Until you stop using all by-products of oil, you are hypocrites, sorry. Quit trying to eat the cake.

Understand that the coastal waters are important to us. An additional tanker holding 130,000 barrels of crude oil a day on our waters, is a big risk!
If there was a guarantee of no spillage, it would be different!

8381 2018-04-09 06:59:00 I needed lotion for my sunburnt ass head this morning and checked @AteTheNoJeans travel bag and proceeded to count:

4 bottles of beard oil, 3 bottles of beard pomeade, like 9 different brushes, and like 12 different beard shampoos. The man is a god damn chemist!

8393 2018-04-09 06:56:29 I support your sentiment. I'm merely saying that unless palm oil disappears, there will be PKE in the world and we can't pretend that by moving PKE out of NZ that there's a magical environmental improvement on a global level. The net global enviro outcome could be even worse.

8398 2018-04-09 06:54:03 The CBD oil is better, it comes in capsules and can be ordered online. When marijuana is smoked you do receive a contact high when smoked from the THC levels. Varying on the type of marijuana really depends on the level of THC.

8412 2018-04-09 06:50:36 The markets will decide where the oil industry goes. But, be assured, it is a mature industry operating in a very long sunset. The majors know this, which is why they are diversifying.

8421 2018-04-09 06:49:11 We produce 5% of the world's supply of oil. We aren't "world class", we are price-takers. Stop demanding that other provinces and Canadians worship Alberta, and that they grovel for the business that gets thrown their way. It's unseemly and arrogant.

8429 2018-04-09 06:47:36 I've worked for NGO's. If you don't understand how they function or where that money comes from and goes too, you're inclined to believe the false narrative drummed up by the oil and gas backed "news" agencies. Ignorance is easier than diligence. Don't be a patsy.

Russia wants a Kurdish autonomous zone within Syria to annoy Turkey, and the US is eyeing breaking off them and their oil to weaken Assad/Russia.

8592 2018-04-09 06:18:15 What is our national interest in Middle East? We produce more oil than Middle East countries. Clinton Obama’s Middle East war produced more terrorists

8777 2018-04-09 05:45:15 And still some of the most brutal traffic in the country. LOL I agree with the sentiment but our regional oil and gas development is a natural priority over importing until we get to that carbon free utopia.

8783 2018-04-09 05:44:40 Yeah, their bbq sauce is good, kind of an oil based Hawaiian thing going on.
8784 2018-04-09 05:44:23 Its NOT a civil war.
Us is there to protect and get oil in the northeastern area.
Russia is there to steal huge amounts of gas as agreed with Animal Assad.
Iran is there for religious belief and to steal land and houses everywhere.
Lebanon? Iraq?..
How come you call it CIVIL ?!!!

8792 2018-04-09 05:43:08 Not asking a normative question. I am asking descriptive. How will things play out given what you know of world economics and politics? Saudis are in a vulnerable position; they're bluffing about their oil reserves, and the latest prince read the books; they're going for scam.

8803 2018-04-09 05:40:40 back to the original point which you have failed to answer. Do you believe Shetlanders have the right to self determination in event of Indy Scotland? Shetland has the majority of oil and richest fishing waters. Why be controlled by neighbour that it has no land border with?

8810 2018-04-09 05:39:55 down down down down down in every area. The poor are getting poorer. Big Oil loves her. She’s a fake Betsy DeVos wannabe.

8812 2018-04-09 05:39:35 You forgot that it all started withe the people of Syria wanting to get rid of the Assad opression? That's what isis took advantage from to take over. Now the people are being brought back to square one, with the help of Putin(who wants oil) and Erdogan (who wants all Kurds dead)
8813 2018-04-09 05:39:35 And saved literally billions over the last three decades through industrial agriculture and global trade, all powered by oil.
8814 2018-04-09 05:39:26 She paved the way to a Trump election by displaying how close a babbling imbecile can get to the presidency simply by bending to the will of big oil and NRA interests.
8815 2018-04-09 05:39:23 My mom asked me if my oil pen was marijuana and I told her it was a hookah.
8816 2018-04-09 05:39:07 BMW is a terrorist organization.
8817 2018-04-09 05:38:54 Manipulated by the companies controlling oil, and those profiting from it. IE BP recently saying oil spills are good for local economies. The military industrial complex has been influenced by oil production. The lack of investment into other modes of transport IE electric cars.
8818 2018-04-09 05:38:51 Run out of olive oil for my ear. Middle age right there.
8819 2018-04-09 05:38:46 It must not have oil as well

8822 2018-04-09 05:38:20 Anya kuwa? Let's ask @dawisu bfor condemning I don't think it's true.
8823 2018-04-09 05:38:17 That's $9000 more than my EV last year. And you bought gas and oil for it on top of that.
8824 2018-04-09 05:38:02 where is your opposition to Oil Tankers coming up the St Lawrence River????
Hypocrite!
8825 2018-04-09 05:37:45  I'm oil city so this makes sense
8826 2018-04-09 05:37:43 ปล่อยให้เป็นบ้าสติแตกไปแบบนั้นแหละ บอกไม่อยากให้มีดราม่าแต่ที่ตัวเองทำอยู่มันเรียกว่าอะไรไหนพูด ? ศลป.ใครๆก็รัก ลองให้ไปว่าเมนตัวเองบ้างมั้ยจะได้รู้สึก ใจเขาใจเราอ้ะ จำไว้ในหัวสมองบ้างนะ
8827 2018-04-09 05:37:40 Feels so good having my car back :(
I took her for granted, but now I’m gonna do every oil change, every tire rotation, go the speed limit, I’m gonna love this bitch
8828 2018-04-09 05:37:14 If he is...he could have helped her out and scrap up some castor oil for edges or at least a lil side gig at the location dang....
8829 2018-04-09 05:37:02 Trump, Ryan, McConnell & other Republicans are OK with Pruitt ripping off the American people as long as he keeps the coal & oil industry happy. We ask Republicans who protects us, the buyers of coal & oil, for without us their industry fails to exist
8830 2018-04-09 05:37:00 Donate face oil to chiefs for $100 an ounce
8831 2018-04-09 05:36:52 @potus must believe select people will get something now. And that something most likely is oil. #GenieEnergy
8832 2018-04-09 05:36:50 I think not letting Saddam control Saudi and Kuwaiti oil was good.  I think removing him from power was bad.  I think we didn’t appreciate the Shi’a/Sunni civil war in Iraq that only a strongman could contain.  I think Syria presents very similar issues
8833 2018-04-09 05:36:50 He’s got a point though!...oil economy is dropping with technology + Dubai (although a state) doesn’t depend on oil as it does with tourism and look where it took them
8834 2018-04-09 05:36:46 Don’t you mean because he’s carrying out the policies of the oil and gas industry? Pruitt’s corruption is unprecedented, even  for the most corrupt Executive Branch in the history of our country.
8835 2018-04-09 05:36:24 Times like these I wish I had a personal masseuse. An hour PLEASE !! Don’t forget the peppermint oil.
8836 2018-04-09 05:36:13 The issue is the pipeline is there. The oil spilled. What else matters
8837 2018-04-09 05:36:10 If face oil was worth as much as regular oil I wouldn’t have to complain about adult acne
8838 2018-04-09 05:35:59 Minister, there is enough conventional oil in the world to get us through the transition to renewables. I don't believe there's any further excuse for either tar sands or undersea drilling. Canada should be leading the world in innovative clean energy. Get with it! @SquamishJason
8839 2018-04-09 05:35:50 throw some black castor oil on it.
8840 2018-04-09 05:35:37 But no castor oil or protein treatment for your edges??? Jigga What???
8841 2018-04-09 05:35:32 "Just use a bit of oil to cook"
"But idk how to cook"

Dude its just a thin layer of oil and you put your chicken on it. Also I recommended use butter instead and he said "muh cholesterol"
8842 2018-04-09 05:35:18 The Chinese...early and controversial investor in oil  sands projects... took a good look and substantially divested a few years ago. Things have only gotten worse since that point for attraction and retention of both foreign and domestic investment. The world knows....
8843 2018-04-09 05:35:04 “Dumping”? Demand is increasing annually. Yes, China has an air problem due to cheap coal and bad filters. There’s not enough “green” energy to drive all the energy the world requires .. for 8B people .. roughly 250M+ BOE daily. 100M is oil and 2/3 of rest is coal, nuclear or gas
8844 2018-04-09 05:34:43 Now google these specific goats and Argan oil 
8845 2018-04-09 05:34:43 ตอนแรกคุยกับเพื่อนเรื่องสิวฮอร์โมน ว่าทำยังไง รำคาญจัง เพื่อนก็แนะนำว่ากิน evening primrose oil แล้วดีขึ้น ก็เลยไปลองอ่านดู เห็นว่าช่วยเกี่ยวกับสุขภาพของผู้หญิง ฮอร์โมน ผิวพรรณงี้ กินมา 3 เดือน เรื่องสิว สำหรับเราไม่ได้ช่วยมาก แต่ก็ลดลงนิดหน่อย ไม่มีพวกเม็ดใหญ่ๆปวดๆขึ้นเท่าไหร่
8846 2018-04-09 05:34:23 and stealing land, dont forget stealing land which are rich in oil and water.. oh yea and stealing maritime borders,
8847 2018-04-09 05:34:16 Oh don't forget you need to get your air, fuel, and oil filters replaced every so often too 
8848 2018-04-09 05:34:15 Won't happen. There's no oil to be had in the USA. I would like to see so many of these "true patriots" try to stand up to an invasion force though, since they claim that's why they "need guns."
8849 2018-04-09 05:34:01 ...and the Turks buy oil from ISIS
8850 2018-04-09 05:33:59 Me, face dripping like I just took a bath in a deep fryer: just a lil bit more argan oil I need that dewy glow

8856 2018-04-09 05:32:30 RT!!! She can’t take that new car to the beauty supply and pick up some castor oil?
8857 2018-04-09 05:32:16 Oil is a BIG inducement to meddling (under false pretenses, of course), but not the only one.  But, broadly speaking, such interventions/regime-change wars, etc., are far more often due to resources/money/power than the well-being of the people of that country or safety of USA.
8858 2018-04-09 05:32:15 Got an oil change Friday car felt good. I cleaned air filter an replaced the intake an car feels amazing now. I don’t work on my car but to have it feeling like this knowing I did it makes me happy
8859 2018-04-09 05:32:12 Somebody is pissed that’s a Trump was planning on pulling troops OUT of Syria. That person is McCain, backed by his financiers, one of which is George Soros. They all want to profit on Syrian oil. Them and the FSA. Free Syria Army.
8860 2018-04-09 05:32:12 yeah I think I pushed the cotton in too far or sumchin, nothing some olive oil can’t fix tho
8861 2018-04-09 05:32:12 Not to mention how can anyone afford Apple brand gas, oil, tires, wiper fluid and headlights?
8862 2018-04-09 05:31:56 From the little I know, #Norway has managed its oil assets admirably. Why has #Alberta managed theirs so abysmally? And I’m not talking about the current NDP government. #cdnpoli
8863 2018-04-09 05:31:32 Don’t forget all the OIL in them!
8864 2018-04-09 05:31:28 took my car to get an oil change today and parked next to another civic (completely random) and they told me to come back in an hour. ten minutes later, the lady calls me and says she can’t get the key in the ignition to turn and she was deadass in some random persons car. 
8865 2018-04-09 05:31:25 @BCLiberals huge donors are horrified that @bcndp cannot be bought. Wilkinson goes to bat for oil cartels. #corruption must stop. #bcpoli.
8866 2018-04-09 05:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but removal.
8867 2018-04-09 05:31:07 MAD RESPECT!!! Yeah I just let my stuff air dry for the most part but I def need to get on that blowdryer wave. 
Also i work w mad oil so you gotta wait mad long to even THINK of starting a new layer. Some pieces take months to do in oil for me.
8868 2018-04-09 05:30:59 "It's vanilla oil.." She smiles, feeling her cheeks burning red hot. Normally overly aggressive language would be a turnoff, but something about Nigel makes it.. different. He's so sexy, so manly.. so.. yum. Selene breathes gently, pressing her knees closer together -

8874 2018-04-09 05:29:45 My recommendation to Putin was let the Kurds have the oil, it won't do any good without a strong partner with a seaport...

Let Syria Rest in Peace, they have been through enough pain.
8875 2018-04-09 05:29:38 yeah I have my cast iron and a stainless steel pan for that. 

I’m now reading reviews and… apparently people seriously want to cook without butter or oil???

Will be interesting to see how these wear.
8876 2018-04-09 05:29:11 crow: *replaces rom's sesame oil with lube*
8877 2018-04-09 05:28:57 It would not affect the railways in the sense that they might not ship as much oil but the gap would be filled by the need of farmers. Currently the rail companies do not have enough locomotives and cars to handle demand of the oil sector as well as agricultural sectors.

8879 2018-04-09 05:28:41 The process of touching your face to check if your acne is gone to find out it's not and you just rubbed oil all on your acne I'd a vicious cycle
8880 2018-04-09 05:28:22 This is so correct, only you forgot who is working on the infrastructure and the oil?
The same that destroyed all
8881 2018-04-09 05:28:20 I guess I should have specified oil investments. Gas is land locked, different market. I actually hope you are right and I am wrong. I dearly hope so. I am not a perms-bear. Perhaps we can even get some investment to develop the Alberta Bakkan field.
8882 2018-04-09 05:28:17 Why do you describe the oil market as rampant. In many respects it is manipulated
8883 2018-04-09 05:28:11 Bawangnya ditumis sih pake olive oil dikiiitttt ajah. nanti minyak2 dr ayamnya jg ada.

8886 2018-04-09 05:27:31 Texas eh? Is that where “all” of the AB oil capital originates? Might wanna do some research before you throw that dart. Ever hear of a company called BP? CNRL? Maybe find out who owns those before laying blame on one state!
8887 2018-04-09 05:27:25 So when the taps from Alberta turn off, how will you replace those lost barrels of oil? Oh I know, you will bring the oil in by tanker from foreign sources. Yes, I see the logic here

8917 2018-04-09 05:23:41 Ridiculous comparison anyway.  Barrel of oil weighs 300 lbs, so this spill has so far spewed 1,455 tons of toxic sludge, harder to remove from the environment than human waste. Even believing the likely inflated figure of 5 tons of waste, this is more than 291 protests’ worth.
8918 2018-04-09 05:23:20 the decision to double the pipeline and dump all that oil in Burnaby and then to ship it out the Georgia straight was insane!   #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
8919 2018-04-09 05:23:12 The problem isn’t just potential oil spills. It’s pushing use of a product that’s exacerbating climate change. Invest in sustainable sources

8923 2018-04-09 05:22:06 Sorry. Got so tired of the black oil and Cigarette Smoking Man. And corn and bees. My faves remain the Monster of the Week, for the most part.
8924 2018-04-09 05:21:54 I love BURNING THE SHIT OUT OF MYSELF with 500 DEGREE OIL.
8925 2018-04-09 05:21:47 Seriously. Take the subsidies given each year to big oil, invest in a giant battery plant in Fort Mac, mandate 20% EV production in Canada by 2020. Give Canadians a carbon tax generated subsidy to kickstart demand. There. Better plan in 30 seconds.
8926 2018-04-09 05:21:31 Hot refrigeration system apparently used chilli oil as Velveeta to real cheese
8927 2018-04-09 05:21:09 I just burned my face with boiling oil.
8928 2018-04-09 05:21:07 The new pipeline would allow the bitumen get to a market that pays more than the USA. The USA controls our oil right now. Bitumen is also wanted around the world for many other uses ie. Shingles, road Building, road repair and more. There is a $1 billion bitumen plant approved.
8929 2018-04-09 05:21:06 Yeah, FBI is burning the midnight oil on the case! The "investigation" has been going on supposedly since 2015. The only people claiming impropriety with campaign money are Hillary cultists that are still pissed their queen didn't get her coronation.
8930 2018-04-09 05:21:01 Many times have repeated that Brent is called Brent Oil not crude oil, where as WTI crude is called crude oil.Brent is from North Sea that does not reflect OPEC reference price.

8937 2018-04-09 05:20:15 Why do we have to run out cars in oil or gas? Brazil or Peru runs its vehicles off of sugar.

8954 2018-04-09 05:17:19 The problem is that there will be 7 times the tankers (from 4 to 28) a month.
The upgrade will allow for much bigger tankers too (120,000 TONNS of crude oil per tanker).

If we never have an accident, it will be phenomenal for the Alberta & Canada. 1 accident, it will cost BC!

8963 2018-04-09 05:16:11 Unless you count the continued and very large importation of foreign oil to eastern refineries, with the commensurate loss of billions in tax revenue and access to global oil price. You know, that consequence. @GasBuddyDan

8988 2018-04-09 05:13:03 I would love to hear the rebuttals to this article. The demand for oil is NOT going down, will we take it by increasingly congested and aging railways or by a modern pipeline?

8992 2018-04-09 05:12:43 Alberta has given the Oil companies BILLIONS $$ by not requiring them to pay full Royalties until construction is complete.

8996 2018-04-09 05:11:48 How about the Feds and Provinces CUT all oil company subsidies? Unless, they build some refinery capacity in the lower mainland? Then that creates the jobs in Canada, not China. Then we can stop importing 70% of our refined products from the USA.

8998 2018-04-09 05:11:23 Bitumen is only a part of the O&G products, even comparable grade oil gets a discount because we are a single customer country with a pipeline bottleneck
8999 2018-04-09 05:11:13 No one else has the motivation. This is about oil deposits Israel has already sold.

9006 2018-04-09 05:09:25 & there is Alberta's problem..... Short sighted. Should have planned for refineries while developing oil sands production rather than depending on a single country's (US) investment in refineries.

9031 2018-04-09 05:05:38 It’s in the national interest to invest in green energy, and move away from oil. I know your in a hard place, with the oil industry and Canadian jobs on the line. But there are jobs in green energy as well, and it’s more than worth it to make the move, and soon.

9040 2018-04-09 05:04:47 big oil is scared of any serious look into their operations. They know oil will never be as big a part of energy consumption as it was. Wind solar & other greeen energy prigrams are changing the game. If the feds see proof they may stop tax $$ they give big oil.

9049 2018-04-09 05:02:27 The fact of the matter is that this is not what Engineers and Financial staff at Oil & Gas companies are good at. They are not built as politically oriented entities but need to do a much better job of it. It confuses them when they have all permits to be held up.

9053 2018-04-09 05:02:12 They are not getting so much money from oil so they are jumping on the tech bandwagon.  With the way they reamed the United States and the rest of the world with OPEC the world must beware!
9054 2018-04-09 05:01:53 Who? The same People who owns the whole 45th floor of Trump Tower . The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is my guess . I heard that Saudi Arabia Oil Fortune Dependency is not Sustainable. Saudi Arabia might go broke by 2020

9060 2018-04-09 05:01:16 I put body oil on right after I get out the shower then after like 5-10 mins put lotion on
9061 2018-04-09 05:01:13 I completely agree , especially with the quality requirements in the US. But.. what about supplementing with krill oil, vitamin C , he shou wu and @mercola ‘s multi-V’s ?
9062 2018-04-09 05:01:01 Listening to these 70s tunes while my heart cries and the oil burns.. how about u hot mama?
9063 2018-04-09 05:00:58 Was it hard to remain on those wooden stairs with that oil on? or did you keep sliding off?
9064 2018-04-09 05:00:56 In my opinion, could be unpopular or a bad idea, but the pipeline does not make sense. Fighting a strong market with our oil, and paying the price refineries charge; so why not have permanent jobs and a Canadian refinery with own oil?
9065 2018-04-09 05:00:50 Started using tea tree oil on my face and it feels so soft and smooth.

9074 2018-04-09 04:58:52 Yeah. Kinda inferred that. Self or other employed job? I work with my students to carve out more time in their days. It's funny the things and places we spend time without thinking about it. Even grabbing 30 minutes back to yourself is awesome.  Add oil!

9083 2018-04-09 04:57:28 The hype around olive oil is the same. Olive oil is only good uncooked, to drizzle on salads. It is not good or healthy when heated. For that the sesame, groundnut and coconut oils are the best. Yet I hear Indians boasting about using olive oil of late.

Saudis want Assad out & have a motive(oil/gas pipelines) to create a"false flag"event. I obviously don't know WHO did it, but...

9093 2018-04-09 04:55:56 Over 100 years of safe oil shipping through Haro Strait so far. You seem to think the way to de-risk the future is to prevent the major maritime safety upgrade program coming with TMEP.

9096 2018-04-09 04:54:56 They need to show stewardship over the environment to gain that elusive social license. KM will sit on the sidelines if they can't prove this to Canadians. The other oil superpowers are laughing at our internal dysfunction.

9103 2018-04-09 04:53:44 You're not sorry and what you claim re "oil port" is not true either; after the terminal and pipeline expansion oil tankers would still be only a minority of ship movements in Burrard Inlet. Also it's not a LM project, it's national w a federal mandate and shld have prov support.

9114 2018-04-09 04:52:11 Oil is power. Wars are fought over oil. This was planned from the start.
9115 2018-04-09 04:52:09 One might think, if the goal were to keep an oil cartel from forming (or an existing one from growing in clout -- OPEC is already here), one would want to avoid making a top ally of one of the world's two top oil producers and a despised enemy of the other, even via proxy wars.
9116 2018-04-09 04:52:07 Not only is Pruitt a self serving crook, but he is a destroyer of the earth.  He should be arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to 40 years of community service cleaning up oil spills.
9117 2018-04-09 04:51:12 Y’all remember when we came together for the cheap wig thread? Can we do one for cheap beauty hacks? Witch Hazel for toner, african shea butter and self-tanner for glowing skin, shaving with baby oil, like gimme y’alls secrets cause ppl be looking so bomb these daysss 
9118 2018-04-09 04:51:00 There are people who don't learn from other's mistakes or experiences. The port city of Balikpapan levelled in fire from an oil spill that filled the port and that was refined oil not this hugely toxic and volatile "garbage crude" (as China referred to it)
9119 2018-04-09 04:50:33 People are the engine, oil just lubricates the economy so it runs fast and hot without seizing. Which it inevitably does when the oil is no longer valuable.
9120 2018-04-09 04:50:31 I only put baby oil on half my body  I'm not doing the other half I'm sleepy 
9121 2018-04-09 04:50:21 Make no mistake Port Vancouver is one of the busiest ports. Ships navigate the Gulf Islands regularly without issues, usually. There have been accidents. Now enter oil tankers. Thsi IS a non renewable resource. You need to sail the Gulf Islands
9122 2018-04-09 04:50:17 Lol.. hemp can replace oil as well as many other materials/foods. We can make facilities to recycle plastic back into oil and fuel, eliminating plastic and replacing with other materials that dont harm the environment.

9130 2018-04-09 04:48:53 That's an interesting article!

As usual the nuances require a lot of study.

Interesting that they agree that Alberta's continual reliance on oil is the source of their problems (not the cure).
9131 2018-04-09 04:48:53 Kinder Morgan share holders should sue the Canadian government. Should site Trudeau being in a cult of global warming/climate change being anti science. Also, oil is organic.

9137 2018-04-09 04:48:02 That means oil prices change. It means we no longer get the most preferential negotiation positions at the table. It means we can be subjected to sanctions and trade wars. It means that GOP and corporatocratic wealth will be the subject of targeting by international players.
9138 2018-04-09 04:47:30 The biggest regional player in oil is "our ally" the Saudi regime, so that's a dubious excuse for meddling in OTHER M.E. countries to keep oil manipulators from taking over. And that still doesn't refute the power & ulterior motives of US military-industrial complex (+UK cronies)

9141 2018-04-09 04:47:14 Exactly....so we refine oil in Alberta, break it down into numerous products, which will need to get to market by....numerous pipelines.... which the eco terrorists oppose, so how are we ahead?
9142 2018-04-09 04:47:13 India is second largest importer of Kuwati Crude Oil, yet we are made to suffer because of this unfair regulation.
9143 2018-04-09 04:46:46 US government is run by many special un-elected global interests, including banking sector, military complex and oil industry, and not Israel per say. Israel does have a lot of influence on US foreign policy, and even that only in specific sectors of interest, Macron is Dog of US

9150 2018-04-09 04:46:01 Meanwhile solar power has become the most cost efficient form of power globally and China who you want to sell oil to is becoming world leader in renewables. Ironic isn’t it. Stupid Canadians - selling its soul and future for a buck.

9155 2018-04-09 04:44:44 Oil pipelines can be refurbished to transport hydrogen right?
9156 2018-04-09 04:44:30 For the record, our children's future is terribly imperilled by the fossil fuel reserves of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Bahrain, Nigeria, Mexico, and numerous other petro-states. No one's horizon is limited to AB' oil sands. This is a global struggle for survival.@350

9161 2018-04-09 04:43:47 The BC NDP just did what was hard but necessary, slapped massive taxes on Real Estate - which pays BC gov more in tax revenue than royalties AB gets from oil. They did what was HARD but necessary. Notley is showing ZERO leadership on this.

9171 2018-04-09 04:42:40 Why would Mr. Trudeau comment about Alberta's fiscal arrangements? Ms. Notley is stuck with Alberta's idea that the oil industry should pay for everything. A PST is a third-rail that even the NDP can't bring itself to touch.
9172 2018-04-09 04:42:40 No, Alberta will be better off without KM, because it's not going to go down with the Big Oil Titanic.

9173 2018-04-09 04:42:31 Berkshire Hathaway is Buffet's company. The Rockefeller charities divested from oil (loudly) a few years ago. Of course they give to enviro charities. It doesn't have anything to do with US Oil wanting to preserve price. Nobody has linked Koch to LN, Tides, or any other ENGO.

9177 2018-04-09 04:42:00 .I think your last sentence is the most important and my point in responding. It’s not the current governments fault. It’s the price of oil; the changing O&G landscape; US shale oil; not the NDP. The #UCP should build s narrative; but not an untrue narrative; that’s fiction.
9178 2018-04-09 04:41:57 Yes you can feel the panic of those associated with the oil industry trying to maximize their take while they can, the days are numbered.
9179 2018-04-09 04:41:38 the world wants oil....to the tune of 100mmbbl/d.  we are trying to provide it.
9180 2018-04-09 04:41:27 No money to be made on our border. Oil, natural gas, pipelines, human trafficking, drugs, arm deals etc. in the middle east. Just a taxpayer investment for the deep state to make a fortune

9182 2018-04-09 04:41:16 Tomatoes and onions proves depend on the crop season and export.. Petrol is solely set by the government based on the international crude oil price.. Mr modi ok his campaign highlighted the then increased fuel price and said ache din aree aur abhi pavbhaji kaare ?
9183 2018-04-09 04:41:12 今までがｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰ知らなすぎた
9184 2018-04-09 04:41:12 Keep up the good work. Yes it's sad for Alberta oil workers, but if they need alternative job ideas they could always start cleanup on the environmental disaster they've made. That $27B+ job would create lots of employment and be environmentally responsible too.
9185 2018-04-09 04:41:09 More wine for me and #Cascadia. Oh and the price of gas in the lower mainland has always been a joke. We’ve had decades of big oil making up prices here. Sick of them. So fuck’em, we will find a cleaner way.
9186 2018-04-09 04:41:05 The tried energy East, blamed them. Tried Keystone, blames Obama, then moved on to Kinder Morgan, blamed BC. Fact, there is too much oil sloshing around. And guess what Keystone is now approved.
9187 2018-04-09 04:41:04 My poor car. Needs a cleaning, Oil Change & I need my Tires rotated.
9188 2018-04-09 04:40:56 腹減った
9189 2018-04-09 04:40:46 Can we please dispense with the "you use petroleum products, so you can't be anti-pipeline" BS? Just because we live in a society full of oil products today doesn't mean we can't advocate for less destructive solutions tomorrow.
9190 2018-04-09 04:40:43 I wonder why continuing to invest in a dying unsustainable industry makes sense. While the rest of the world (and now big oil corps) find solutions and make some real progressive change in a renewable infrastructure Canada and the U.S. fall far behind arguing weather to move on.
9191 2018-04-09 04:40:43 US government is run by many special un-elected global interests, including banking sector, military complex and oil industry, and not Israel per say. Israel does have a lot of influence on US foreign policy, and even that only in specific sectors of interest,

9194 2018-04-09 04:40:32 a) The planned and in-progress mega-projects have been completed; b) there are easier/faster ways to make money than the oil sands (which are capital intensive); c) in a supply glut, jurisdictions with few regulations will undoubtedly attract investment. Race to the bottom.

9198 2018-04-09 04:40:08 You'll be on the radio to apologize to your huge donors from the #oil companies.  @bcliberals corruption is not being cleaned up.  Nobody even ran for the leadership on a cleanup platform.  #corruption #influence peddling. #bcpoli
9199 2018-04-09 04:40:08 I believe you 100%. I also know (because I know some of them) that these companies pay environmental engineers that do what they can to lower the risk. There will always be a risk, and an environmental impact with oil, and I want us to invest heavily to move away from it.
9200 2018-04-09 04:40:08 Exactly. U.S. has made a mess of Middle East. Arms for oil exacerbates all the rivalries and resentments there. Who would have thought of the Saudis and Israelis as a team? It's wild and crazy.
9201 2018-04-09 04:39:49 Sunday Service was so incredible.......got an oil change, soon after, went to visit 1 of my uncles in a nursing facility. How i love him so......so much fun, hes something else.
9202 2018-04-09 04:39:46 Several years ago while living in KL, a friend - then with Shell - was invited to the Hague for a weekend  to participate in a think-tank entitled "Shell in a Hundred Years". Their conclusion? Shell would be an energy (not just oil & gas) company trading a suite of energy types.

9207 2018-04-09 04:38:57 Look man, they applied for the permit in 2013. Keystone got approved. Send your oil to the states. Fracking has changed oil economics for next 30 years. Adapt and stop blaming BC for a pipeline that no one wants.
9208 2018-04-09 04:38:57 They all seem to be in the tank for big oil. Rex gets big $$$ for "speeches" at industry gab fests. We dont know about the other 2.
9209 2018-04-09 04:38:53 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK.  We can survive without krill oil; other species need krill to survive - pls stop what you're doing.
9210 2018-04-09 04:38:52 Can ruin anything you liked about a show honestly
9211 2018-04-09 04:38:43 The oil is UNrefined (dirty bitumen) to ship to China. Does NOT make sense for Canadians - whether they drive or not - and definitely NOT worth the risk of a spill!
9212 2018-04-09 04:38:38 My skin is super dry so I’m like ok skin here have some oil please love urself
9213 2018-04-09 04:38:35 Im scared to death of having cancer. I take soursop oil, turmeric tincture, help tincture I'm vegan so yeah and I try to use the microwave as little as possible (when I get my own place I won't even have one). I'm trynna prevent it at all costs. Most of my family has had it

9215 2018-04-09 04:38:32 Just wait till Kenny gets in that will happen. But let's first spend 300k to see why canada can't export our oil.
9216 2018-04-09 04:38:23 Syria is not a major oil producer.. It's oil reserves account for  less than  0.5% of global reserves..that's why USA is not interested and UN is  USA's puppet anyway...

9218 2018-04-09 04:38:20 Unfortunately, it seems to be human nature not to change until we are forced to change. The end of #fossilfuel is a huge change, and we can make it hard or less hard (easy no longer an option). But oil people are not the best ones to make that choice. @ReeferMadness
9219 2018-04-09 04:38:05 I grew up on the water, lived and traveled the world. Worked in the Middle East oil fields in the marine side. Still have cousins working in marine industry in US West Coast. I've seen what is right and wrong. WA State is right. BC clueless.
9220 2018-04-09 04:37:59 I finally did an oil change on my car I’ve been lagging it shit was over 7,000 miles

9227 2018-04-09 04:37:29 @RachelNotley You should come to visit with the resident orcas and see the whales and consume wild BC Salmon. Maybe then you might see why @sk8bccoast (the B.C. Coast) is so committed to protecting our coast. Then again, your oil soaked cowboy boots might not walk you here.
9228 2018-04-09 04:37:25 two men, one is FN, the other i can't tell (no accent) positioning environmentalists as the ones who are supressing and intimidating FNs...

maybe yes...some white environmentalists do use FNs to push their agendas...but wow...

whereas uranium/oil sands comps good partners...

9234 2018-04-09 04:36:59 The Bushes should be embarassed they made the Saudis their buds, even protected them personally after 9/11 when they would have been investigated. Instead, the Bushes are proud as punch, Texas oil men. The long standing friendship is between them n Saudi Royal family.
9235 2018-04-09 04:36:51 Then what happens once the oil runs out?  BTW insults are a sure sign you don’t have an argument that makes any sense at all.
9236 2018-04-09 04:36:49 We have govt so we can tell bad actors to get back in line. In this case the bad actors are the oil companies.
9237 2018-04-09 04:36:36 Tell me if these sound familiar: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Libya and finishing off with Iran. Basically those countries have a lot of oil and strategic importance against Russia. Russia is Syria's biggest ally. They are stopping this plan in Syria.

9241 2018-04-09 04:35:52 I’m a loud and proud liberal. I work in the oil industry. If you can’t name 3 people in your immediate group of friends who would risk everything for their truth, you need a better group of friends.

9248 2018-04-09 04:34:32 What do you expect. In most places in Indiana, only @FoxNews is on in places to eat, Dr offices, even waiting to get your oil changed. One candidate running for Senator brags about supporting trump. IN farmers can go to hell.

9251 2018-04-09 04:34:04 I think this will work well for the short term, hopefully long enough to stop relying on oil as much.
9252 2018-04-09 04:33:56 so it looks like the problem with the axidraw might be that i need to oil it and i'm surprised i didn't recognize this weird behavior from when my sewing machine acted up a few years ago. i need to order some oil...

9255 2018-04-09 04:33:29 So is the clean up of the oil the responsibility of the backhoe operator?  Clean up is on those who profit from the product, not the saboteur
9256 2018-04-09 04:33:28 hehe 2nite I’m washing w a muji oil cleanser and then using some moisturizing toner from kikumasamune and then the ordinary’s buffet and stratia liquid gold then the ordinary marula oil and some first aid beauty ultra repair cream
9257 2018-04-09 04:33:14 An American corporation that wants to ship Alberta's oil to China (for a low price) doesn't care about Albertans or British Columbians.

The questionable thing is how, instead of working with both provinces to come up with solutions, they're acting shady and domineering.
9258 2018-04-09 04:33:03 listening to a chief advocate for oil sands b/c of a culture of poverty that is destroying their indigenous culture....

what do you say to that?

paraphrasing..."oil sands = more money = more culrure/language..."

i hear ppl back home make the same statements...and smh...
9259 2018-04-09 04:32:57 No, you dolt, I'm referring to B.C.'s ability to import refined oil from anywhere in the world through our ports. We don't care what you do with your oil and don't need it.
9260 2018-04-09 04:32:45 And exactly why Mr Trump and big oil wants him to stay as long as possible. So gross
9261 2018-04-09 04:32:10 Can some of you fuckers in Congress get off your asses, and lobby the oil/gas/chemical companies to offer extremely lucrative kickbacks to build a manufacturing plant next to Scott Pruitt's home?
9262 2018-04-09 04:31:58 Norway has a Trillion saved from its oil revenues. Alberta has no one to blame but itself.

9266 2018-04-09 04:31:37 my skin is dry so i used vitamin e oil, fresh aloe & a mix of apple cider vinegar and green tea for when i went to sleep. and twice a week aztec clay!
9267 2018-04-09 04:31:31 Why r we going backwards Prime Minister? Our reliance on oil to maintain our economy should almost be behind us. Your going to punish us with a tax for using it, and on the other hand, your risking destroying our soil, water & air with this destructive chemical. #NoOilPipes
9268 2018-04-09 04:31:19 How about you ask Alberta oil companies invest in a new refinery in the lower mainland? To offset the jobs they are exporting? They closed three in Vancouver area.
9269 2018-04-09 04:31:15 Tomorrow's to do list: clean my room, then get an oil change.

9271 2018-04-09 04:31:12 The #wrestling channel in the Discord is currently speculating that Vince got paid a *ton* of oil money to have Brock drop it in Jeddah instead later this month.

Which, that is totally a thing the Saudi royal family would do.
9272 2018-04-09 04:31:07 I love how my face is oily as a bottle of olive oil yet dry as the Sahara that you could scratch my face and a layer of skin would come off.
9273 2018-04-09 04:31:00 Because it is owned by the oil companies? Just askin for a friend...
9274 2018-04-09 04:30:53 Certo, è strano che questa guerra finanziaria sia rivolta a uno dei maggiori depositari del debito pubblico statunitense... tranne che... si sia ricomposto l'asse angloamericano su #goldbullion e #oil agli effetti d'una nuova 'cross currency' a tutto vantaggio del #dollaro

9282 2018-04-09 04:30:09 Bb I gotchu. Coconut oil, vitamin c & k oil, and formula 10.06. If you have any makeup that tests on animals, ditch it cause it probably has pore clogging parabens.
9283 2018-04-09 04:30:09 Your texan company shipping oil for a chinese-owned company in Alberta to China doesn't pay any taxes (they get rebates) or for social services like healthcare; they take your $ to export it and then put their profits in a company shell offshore. Don't be stupid. #bcpoli #ableg
9284 2018-04-09 04:30:07 I just put coconut oil on my face, hoping I don't break out
9285 2018-04-09 04:30:06 I don't understand why Israel is bombing them?
Is it just for oil? So they have the same stupid military advisers,  & greedy oil investors we have ! 
9286 2018-04-09 04:30:02 You call this good oil. $4.60 into $2.60 and you tip it an hour ago. Genius!!
9287 2018-04-09 04:30:01 100% agree!  The US murdered democratically elected south american leaders in service of united fruit company profit margins.  The US targets any dictator that threatens USD hegemony or the flow of oil.

9293 2018-04-09 04:29:36 Renewable energy will collapse the tar sands within a few years and even the existing damage will not be covered. Let's not add more, no economic sense.

The future of energy is already here and is renewable, especially wind and solar. Oil is just a bad investment.
9294 2018-04-09 04:29:27 I started using facial oil on my face at night and oh my god I look like a new person
9295 2018-04-09 04:29:21 Politicians tend to see themselves as indispensable in the scheme of things. I can imagine a great many of them literally in complete denial of the possibility that an oil company might just decide, "Ah, I don't need this shit."
9296 2018-04-09 04:29:11 That would be because it is a huge find and it would be pumping oil and gas out for years. Genie corp is easy to find just look it up lots of US guys involved like Dick Cheney.  I have nothing against Israelis just the Zionists. Read The Grand Chessboard it's an eye opener.

9299 2018-04-09 04:28:41 I wish we weren't in the Middle East.  And to the extent that it was for oil, nothing frustrated me more than all those who prevented us from drilling on our own land for environmentalism, exporting the various detriments to other countries.
9300 2018-04-09 04:28:35 I gotta get up tm & get some more tea tree oil for my nose 
9301 2018-04-09 04:28:12 because these dictators operate like Cartel and rule the world through the price of oil. And that pissed off the USA/UK and even Russia at one point in its history. Until such a time that energy is distributed with new better sources (hydrogen), then any cartel will be shut down

9304 2018-04-09 04:28:07 Oily skin is skin that’s not hydrated enough. My T zone is pretty oily and I hate it. Try hydrating masks! And moisturize after your face air dries. And if you wear foundation, prime your face before hand. It helps control oil
9305 2018-04-09 04:28:01 Yeah I guess I live in a fantasy world where oil spills contaminate water and people need clean water to live. And there are alternatives to fossil fuels that become more viable when fossil fuels are not subsidized by governments.

9310 2018-04-09 04:27:09 “Wash day” is tiring AF man.. it consist of oil treatments, deep conditions, countless massages 
9311 2018-04-09 04:26:53 Is it possible that it would be easier to deal with an oil spill in the port of Amsterdam that it would be in the Gulf Island?????
9312 2018-04-09 04:26:47 Are you a journalist or like Rex Murphy and Lorrie Goldstein in the tank for big oil.
9313 2018-04-09 04:26:46 once you’ve found cleansers (oil first step gel second step) and moisturizer and suncreen that work for you you can look into targeting specific skin concerns
9314 2018-04-09 04:26:43 I disagree with the "US/UK are too corrupt" ..Think about the phoney oil shortages of the 80s and what the price per barrel was then ? and then when the higher prices enabled local development of oil in the west and Russia, then they dropped the price to below $10 a barrel ? Why?
9315 2018-04-09 04:26:42 along with my broken essential oil diffuser, i’ve now got a broken heart. RIP to falling laviously into sleep vis lavender scent
9316 2018-04-09 04:26:28 You do know we have refineries in Canada, right? Two in the lower mainland in fact, yet that area still imports 54% of it's fuel requirements, by barge, from US ports. 
And you want off oil? Stop using the products. Starting with whatever technology you used to tweet.
9317 2018-04-09 04:26:23 Coconut oil and extra Virgin olive oil overnight hair masks do me so good 
9318 2018-04-09 04:26:23 Oil markets stabilised on Monday after slumping around 2 percent last Friday on concerns over an intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as increased U.S. drilling activity.
9319 2018-04-09 04:26:22 Love the smell of tea tree oil.
9320 2018-04-09 04:26:20 Oh, shit, I just realized that Vince changed the outcome of the main event of #WrestleMania so Brock can drop the title in Saudi Arabia at The Greatest Rumble.

Roman bled so Vince can get oil money.
9321 2018-04-09 04:26:19 Oil markets stabilised on Monday after slumping around 2 percent last Friday on concerns over an intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as increased U.S. drilling activity.
9322 2018-04-09 04:26:10 I bought a big bottle of rosehip oil from winners for $15 like 6 months ago and idk, I'm no skincare queen but I like it and I'm not even halfway done
9323 2018-04-09 04:26:07 The result of the NEP - made-in-Canada oil price aside, which was ludicrous - is a large, integrated oil company (Suncor/PetroCanada). A lot of money sloshed around AB as a consequence of PIP-grant fuelled Arctic exploration (Panarctic, Dome, Canmar, etc.).
9324 2018-04-09 04:26:01 I haven’t ever used any oil and the food still comes out great. The key is just nailing the timing for the crispness you want. And don’t avoid the preheat. It really works well & is a life saver for leftovers lol
9325 2018-04-09 04:25:51 Hi @ImanAbdulRahim , antara muji oil cleanser and hada labo oil cleanser, mana lagi best and you prefer?
9326 2018-04-09 04:25:40 I need that olive oil..
9327 2018-04-09 04:25:38 Oil markets stabilised on Monday after slumping around 2 percent last Friday on concerns over an intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as increased U.S. drilling activity.
9328 2018-04-09 04:25:34 So have any of my makeup lovers here tried the OG setting spray by skindanavia? I just purchased the oil control, and bridal setting spray. I need to know that I did the right thing . I was going to buy the milk makeup blur spray but this was a better deal .
9329 2018-04-09 04:25:34 The contractor hit the pipe because it was not marked properly. We cleaned up as much as possible. Houses were destroyed, and 40% of the spill made its way into the inlet. Come here and I'll show you the oil in the sand on the beach where I take my dog.
9330 2018-04-09 04:25:31 Those glasses sir, that you are wearing are most likely polymer made from oil products. I’m in the industry, there is no getting away from o and g.

9332 2018-04-09 04:25:24 My aunty just rubbed blessed oil on my swollen legs and my belly. 
9333 2018-04-09 04:25:12 What is clear is that there is a marked lack of reasoning and logical ability on the side of pro oil and pro pipeline.
They are also stuck in an individualized approach to success, a la, Ayn Rand!
9334 2018-04-09 04:25:06 Who is benefiting from blocking Canadian oil?
The U.S.?
Saudi Arabia?
Who???

9335 2018-04-09 04:24:44 Seriously though I need to get my oil changed or my car will blow up
9336 2018-04-09 04:24:42 A 20 piece chicken nuggets, pint of baby oil, jug of hand sanitizer, and an uzi.
9337 2018-04-09 04:24:38 3. Assad is an enemy because he supports the Iranian regime rather than supporting the Saudis. This is the only fact that is true. Oil/energy benefits Russia, Iran. We cannot lie about gas attacks and expect Americans to jump for war. Mattis himself stated Assad ised no gas
9338 2018-04-09 04:24:38 All that oil being produced explains why Taxifornia has the highest gas and diesel prices on the planet. Not to mention the highest gas tax on the planet.
9339 2018-04-09 04:24:34 あーっ！お客様お客様！！あーっ！！
9340 2018-04-09 04:24:07 It’s not about using fossil fuels or not. It’s about creating a smart transition. People are not anti-oil, they are pro smart use of oil. The government continues to fail to provide us with alternative options. While we work for those options in meantime, we still need our cars.
9341 2018-04-09 04:23:55 I just need something get the extra oil and dirt off my face
9342 2018-04-09 04:23:52 its like being a lakers fan but with a lot more baby oil
9343 2018-04-09 04:23:52 Just a big honking tube-shaped ceramic resistor in a can full of oil.

I have a box full of those resistors somewhere, and I'm going to someday make dummy loads out of them and sell 'em.
9344 2018-04-09 04:23:51 just like the rest of the middle east    they want syrias oil
9345 2018-04-09 04:23:50 in my two snaps i’m studying next to oil diffusers. is this my life now?
9346 2018-04-09 04:23:34 Hope you have the oil for them, they not crossing the border. Railway conductor's in Canada voting on taking job action. #strike #nooilmoving #nograinmoving
9347 2018-04-09 04:23:18 @cherishoriley, I hate preaching doom and gloom my beautiful woman, but I am extremely passionate about this particular subject. Trump,Putin, oil barons, billionaire criminals, bankers, traders are just a few who would wipe us off the planet if they thought it was possible. Scary
9348 2018-04-09 04:23:14 You really should choose between being a journalist and being a fat catcher for big oil.

9373 2018-04-09 04:20:28 Thanks, do you still use a little oil with yours? I don't know how it can get stuff so crispy like in the pictures lol
9374 2018-04-09 04:20:16 Nationalize the oil industry and we’ll talk!

9379 2018-04-09 04:19:50 depends on what kind of scars you have but i recommend looking into vitamin c, SUNSCREEN, chemical exfoliation (aha/bha) roeship oil/squalane oil
9380 2018-04-09 04:19:47 Before he was elected Trudeau made no secret of his support for oil. Practically speaking the west needs the revenue. But I hoped he'd have a vision that wasn't solely based on raping our land (like pretty much every other PM to date).
9381 2018-04-09 04:19:43 These 2 weeks of no processed foods has been amazing. Love feeling so clean. Also keeping oil out as well.

9385 2018-04-09 04:19:24 US has demonstrated it does not want to occupy countries there. it is NOT in their best interest to create animosity with Muslims creating more radicalization. But it also does not want to deal with a Cartel of oil dealers that act like drug dealers - playing unfair price rigging
9386 2018-04-09 04:19:13 But whatever, I’m sure you kind Albertans will help me find a job when oil spills destroy Vancouver’s economy

9388 2018-04-09 04:18:58 It's not that easy.This whole thing sprung out control after the Arab spring and it got worse when Turkey got involved in helping Assad's oppostion because of their rivalry and land dispute (Hatay) and also their ongoing Kurdish problem. I doubt that oil is a major factor.

9395 2018-04-09 04:18:19 Everyday I see trains going by 2 locomotives pulling, 1 in the middle & 1 pushing. 90%tank cars with oil & LPG. They should be hauling grain & pulses to the coast. If anything pipelines reduce ghg emissions.
9396 2018-04-09 04:18:10 Please stop bringing mamas, babies, and children into this. Book a flight to Austin and fight this out in a hot oil wrestling ring. Yes, we have one. Coincidentally, it’s located inside a strip club. Point is: leave mamas and chilluns out of this....
9397 2018-04-09 04:18:04 What?   Who's afraid.. the oil industry?  What ?    People are saying it's a waste of money not saying please don't do it.   Government intervention has made it so nobody wants to invest in cdn oil.   Easier to put your money in the u.s.

9401 2018-04-09 04:17:27 I could get a fill, but i could also get a oil change, oh yea and i could also get a tire.
9402 2018-04-09 04:17:27 here's a plan - start harvesting the plastic and use it for roading as India is. It'll lessen our reliance on oil which could be used for more productive purposes. Then lets impose a litter tax on all companies producing non bio-degradable packaging - like in germany
9403 2018-04-09 04:17:22 Actually most of our debt was created by the Harper and Mulroney governments. And Norway made their oil resources public. Ours was sold off to foreign multi-nationals long ago - nothing to do with "zoolander".

9407 2018-04-09 04:16:47 Why? I crafted the car out of reeds by myself (ok my sister helped a little) and pedal it around with my feet like in the Flintstones. Also I'm tweeting you from inside the Ministry of Oil right now.
9408 2018-04-09 04:16:39 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9409 2018-04-09 04:16:08 Yes but the UN is pressuring you and you won't drill much in case you have to give it back. Most know how much oil and gas was found and who owns Genie Corp. You might want to have a look at who surrounds Israel. When Americans find out Israel's involvement in 9-11 it's game over

9420 2018-04-09 04:14:35 You are wrong, majority of the infrastructure is based on natural resources like oil and gas. In most provinces it snow for 6-8 months a year. Renewable energy cannot supply the power that needed at low cost for the infrastructure like vehicles and homes.

9435 2018-04-09 04:12:54 If our government ends up being litigated into bedrock by an oil company for abusing its power to harass a project that was only opposed by 10% of British Columbians *and* was the lynch-pin to the national climate framework, they will *never* live it down.

9446 2018-04-09 04:12:09 No like wait how do you paint using oil thou This is amazing ey 
9447 2018-04-09 04:12:09 It’s happening right now, including oil produced in the northern part of the province of BC. You’re kidding right?
9448 2018-04-09 04:11:53 My clothes and car are made of reeds I will never sit down and I will never stop calling out the Oil Minister which is definitely a thing.
9449 2018-04-09 04:11:35 2018-19 oil revenue 48 billlion .
9450 2018-04-09 04:11:28 Ain’t nothing slicker than a baby momma spilling baby oil 
9451 2018-04-09 04:11:24 Pampanga pa-change oil hahaha
9452 2018-04-09 04:11:17 Well I guess you will see when our flow of oil stops.
9453 2018-04-09 04:11:02 Please, call me what my car calls me, GASCAP OIL CHANGE
9454 2018-04-09 04:11:01 Japan and South Korea are not even on the list. Oil can do wonders.
9455 2018-04-09 04:10:52 Speaking politically, Notley hasn't had much of an option at all—her only hope for reelection is to be the oil industry's biggest cheerleader. Fed Liberals have been all over the map. Big statements, but also a lot of "don't do it by half if you can do it by quarters."

9459 2018-04-09 04:10:09 More expansion means more emissions? Sounds great, so you won’t be needing all that extra oil from Alaska then...
9460 2018-04-09 04:10:05 Why is one pipeline life or death? Is it because Alberta should have saved it's oil revenues for a rainy day instead of buying everyone color tv's?
9461 2018-04-09 04:10:00 Can’t slick a can of oil....
9462 2018-04-09 04:09:59 It was supposed to go by rail at the beginning of January, they didn't have space until now.  That's what a lot of farmers across the country are dealing with while oil clogs up the railways
9463 2018-04-09 04:09:50 I think about this CONSTANTLY. Rose hip oil, Kindle in conjunction with library card, marble contact paper, disher (for cookies AND meatballs), Warby Parker glasses.
9464 2018-04-09 04:09:38 sir OIL long hold or exit ?
9465 2018-04-09 04:09:30 So it's not about the oil than. Blocked for being stupid.

9469 2018-04-09 04:08:59 I think that’s a game for you Donald, your just want to enter and find a door for the oil, that’s all what you care about.
9470 2018-04-09 04:08:56 how much? what kind of oil? what if you bring your own?
9471 2018-04-09 04:08:55 @SeamusORegan, did you? Many Newfoundland and Labradorians feed their families from money made from oil and gas. #Transmountain #NLpoli #CDNpoli
9472 2018-04-09 04:08:53 Right... about the time Albertans pay 20% annual tax on BC property holdings. You know, to be held in a legacy fund for oil spill clean ups? Oh hey, if you sold that dilbit line to us for refined product as well, you might have had it built already. Rip/Ship of no value.

9476 2018-04-09 04:08:20 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
9477 2018-04-09 04:07:59 What does money matter to BC?  The province has already cost Alberta and Canada billions in revenue which could have easily paid for a world class spill response   several times over.  It's not just about oil. I worked for a farmer last week that was delivering his canola finally
9478 2018-04-09 04:07:48 the baby oil to hair ratio is bad
9479 2018-04-09 04:07:40 But Notley and Trudeau both had options to not double down on this. They bear responsibility, too.

(And if you want to argue the oil case: Lougheed and his ilk who stopped the NEP and the pipelines it would've built then.)
9480 2018-04-09 04:07:38 Indian Oil buys 17 per cent stake in Oman oil field
9481 2018-04-09 04:07:30 Is that the the record, growing  global oil consumption year over year talking? Or the fact that Canada has the third largest reserve?  #factsmatter #TheMoreYouKnow
9482 2018-04-09 04:06:57 Your clearly delusional and misinformed which is what the 19th century automakers and big oil want you to believe as they rape your wallet & bank accounts. There are over 35 new EV models for sale today and a few even lower cost used if an  owner traded to upgrade.
9483 2018-04-09 04:06:31 There is little chance of an oil spill and the benefits for so many people outweigh the risks.

More oil. House are NOT the same relative to wages.  Problem is not young people read a stat. 50 years ago student loan debt was crippling.
9487 2018-04-09 04:06:02 What about those 500,000 killed by the USA forces in Iraq , Vietnam and Afghanistan for Mainly to Get their dirty hands on their Oil resources . USA is the biggest War criminal in the world . Stop worrying about us and start focusing on China and Russia.

9490 2018-04-09 04:05:33 On April 4, Oil Minister Mohammed bin Khalifa al-Khalifa revealed that Bahrain's recently discovered oil and gas field, Khaleej Al Bahrain, holds an estimated 81.5 billion barrels of oil and 390 billion cubic meters of associated gas in place.
9491 2018-04-09 04:05:32 we made homemade rosewater w lemon and vitamin e oil. organic n shiiiii. none of that mario badescu anymore
9492 2018-04-09 04:05:28 IF only they didnt have our oil under their land.
9493 2018-04-09 04:05:27 Squint
9494 2018-04-09 04:05:27 Not really. Renewables employ more people than the oil sands do now and it is a growing sector whereas oil/gas is a dying (and deathly) game.
9495 2018-04-09 04:05:27 How is piping oil a “core national interest” anyway, how about nationalize the oil then? We all get to share the profits? Hey where are you going...

9501 2018-04-09 04:04:22 Good oil! I’m assuming by the time I visit you guys I’ll have to come with new vegetarian recipes:)
9502 2018-04-09 04:04:22 Hello bot, you can't even lie well. People swim all over Vancouver and Victoria and up and down the coast. The only time they can't is when there is an oil spill in Burrard Inlet.
9503 2018-04-09 04:04:18 Hmmm... He look like he in the pain... (Grabs his computer screen and shakes it) YOU NEED THE OIL!!! IT HURT IF NO USE THE OIL!!!
9504 2018-04-09 04:04:09 That article is definitely laughing at AB and BC's squabbling.

Even with this pipeline, the "oil boom" isn't coming back.
9505 2018-04-09 04:04:07 Well, William, between the two, U.S. & Israel who is more likely to want to 'start' a war between U.S. & Russia? Israel has just bombed Gaza as well. They also know Assad has stated he plans 2 regain the Golan. Israel has illegally sold the oil/gas rights of Golan to Genie Energy

9512 2018-04-09 04:03:21 their programms were not planned well as anticipated.with alot of money came in as loans from out side on anticipation to get oil money
9513 2018-04-09 04:03:18 Answer is still no guys. No amount of bullying is going to change that. Your total incompetence and refusal to use that Oil wealth to build a refinery is coming back to bite you.

Instead of being prudent, you lie. Now oil is 30 less a barrel,and you try to give BC all the risk ?

9521 2018-04-09 04:02:47 Elon Musk is pulling it together. That's the issue here. Media reports are against Tesla (probably influenced buy oil money) so they don't report on all the good news/development of Tesla. Elon is producing Model 3 like a mad man, according to the media he has trouble producing.
9522 2018-04-09 04:02:43 He’s clearly bought and paid for by the oil lobby and social conservatives. 

Absolutely betrothed to them.

9527 2018-04-09 04:02:16 A movement fuelled and financed by American oil interests. Landlock Canadian oil is the underlying mantra.
9528 2018-04-09 04:02:15 Oil ongc again not performing
9529 2018-04-09 04:02:08 I hope they come from Alberta, made with Alberta oil, by Albertans. Keep the jobs here, it's such a no brainer.

9535 2018-04-09 04:01:52 Horgan is decimating the Alberta oil industry. The bastard is very un-Canadian.
9536 2018-04-09 04:01:45 What a great dinner- HUGE artichokes from Calabasas Farmers Market- boiled and then oven baked with lemon honey butter- and Wild Rockfish on wild greens, avocado, onion with aged white balsamic and olive oil - topped with sautéed leeks in French butter. — feeling happy
9537 2018-04-09 04:01:35 Perhaps that $280,000 consultation the Liberals have ordered will help shed light on the mystery as to why investment in Canadian oil continues to evaporate.  I mean clearly scenarios like this have not made it obvious enough to everyone.
9538 2018-04-09 04:01:34 I'd guess some kind of oil or gel?

9550 2018-04-09 04:01:05 Exactly. Its a shame they became so protective. They need to clean up their oil/gas quality as well. Its dirty and watered down.
9551 2018-04-09 04:00:59 They have already conflated provincial interests with the interests of the oil companies. They may as well make it official.
9552 2018-04-09 04:00:47 Gas and Oil folks don't want electric cars.
9553 2018-04-09 04:00:46 one thing i would like to thank keto for introducing me to is putting a little bit of coconut oil in coffee and tea - it is SO YUMMY and a great way for someone like me who doesn't like cooking with coconut oil (too distinct of a flavor) to ingest this wonderful thing
9554 2018-04-09 04:00:40 You’ll have to forgive Tom. He made his billions in the oil industry, so he thinks that he runs the world.

9556 2018-04-09 04:00:24 I believe most Albertans are offended when a province that benefits from Alberta’s oil industry fights against that industry.  Why on earth would it be otherwise?
9557 2018-04-09 04:00:23 After I get out the shower, I put on an excessive amount of coconut oil on my skin. Now I’m literally drippin everywhere

9581 2018-04-09 03:58:22 I take the environmental harm of batteries over the environmental harm of oil/fossil fuel any day. Electric cars are in their baby shoes and need further development/inventions. The fossil fuel industry is harming the environment so much more and it's not evolving from that.
9582 2018-04-09 03:58:22 Well at least you're not trying to hide the fact that you're a straight up shill for the oil industry. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #bc #stopkm
9583 2018-04-09 03:58:15 The Conservatives approved Northern Gateway which the Liberals killed and 4 other major pipelines which are moving oil right now. Stop with the falsehoods!
9584 2018-04-09 03:58:06 It's all about the Iran pipeline & Russian dominance over natural gas to Europe. This is why the Ukraine regime fell as well. Genie oil drilling rights. A number of specific reasons. But, it is energy dominance. Russia & Iran could hold a monopoly on European energy markets.
9585 2018-04-09 03:58:05 yeah the ones that have tea tree oil in them are, you can get ones that are okay for animals, we have cats and rabbits which are inside pets and we used candles for the smell, however my mom started making her own after awhile and we burn homemade ones
9586 2018-04-09 03:58:03 She is on 4 capsules of fish oil a day. So no issue with dry hair. :) Vegetables are chopped. But I might have to soften the kibbles... She doesn’t like to drink water... ><
9587 2018-04-09 03:58:02 Actually yes, I protested a housing development that tried to build on protected agricultural land last year. That "few bits" of new development will triple the amount of oil and increase tanker traffic 7-fold in a very narrow inlet, numb nuts.
9588 2018-04-09 03:57:40 Something to do with a gas or oil pipeline that needs to run through Syria?
9589 2018-04-09 03:57:34 Trying out CBD oil to assist my recovery from BED/bulimia. The BED is usually a response to a stressor and if CBD helps me curb that response then I'm all for it.
9590 2018-04-09 03:57:29 15% off oil changes & tire rotations isn’t great reimbursement IMHO.

Basically when you're under pressure your skin produces stress hormones, including cortisol, that can stimulate your oil glands to make testosterone that then increases oil production and clogs pores.”

9602 2018-04-09 03:56:04 LMAO. So far he has sent that "miracle water", rubber band, ashes,a hand cut out of cloth with "miracle oil"... I figure it is wasting his money not mine and no I did not send a penny...
9603 2018-04-09 03:55:53 Doubtful that Assad is poisoning his people. Sounds like dirty work of US #CIA. 
We have lost thousands of young men and women plus Trillions of dollars benefiting the Military Industrial Complex and oil companies. #FollowtheMoney.
9604 2018-04-09 03:55:39 What part of long term consequences of using the oil from that source are you failing to understand?
9605 2018-04-09 03:55:38 We got under armor body suits with all these microfiber technologies to add warm layers under your clothes and big leaguers are rubbing themselves down with baby oil and Vaseline to close their pores for warmth??????

9608 2018-04-09 03:55:29 This is bullshit, US did the chemical attack, blamed it on assad so they can have a reason for attack. Simple  politics. You can not trust the US, Remember what they said about Iraq, look what happened after, there was no nuclear weapons. Killed millions stole there oil and left

Scott, can't you outlaw cars that get more than 30mpg.  It would be a great boon to the oil industry. And can't you get rid of those damn Prius's.  They get over 50mph. It's unAmerican.
9611 2018-04-09 03:54:49 With the Omnibus Bill he is funding Planned Parenthood, not funding the wall.  He's being run by the military.  He has not brought the troops home.  We have been at war in Syria and Afghanistan for oil and drugs and God knows what else.
9612 2018-04-09 03:54:48 I don’t do too much to it at home. Just coconut oil, Cantu Argan oil serum and wild growth
9613 2018-04-09 03:54:45 So let's get oil from a country foolish enough to accept the spillage danger... Same price to us, and no tax $ from my paycheque to pay for it!!

9617 2018-04-09 03:54:27 Canada has one of the healthiest environments in the world. Eventually move away from oil but not till there are CHEAPER solutions. Why punish Canadians & the economy? Canada has the worlds third largest oil resource, that isn't short term for jobs or for attracting investors.
9618 2018-04-09 03:54:26 Can we please stop burning food?  Pretty please.  There is no longer an oil shortage which prompted the 10% ethanol program taxpayer paid subsidies.
9619 2018-04-09 03:54:10 I agree that we need to move away from fossil fuels, but a wholesale change is not viable for our economy - nevermind that all the protests stink of American and others wanting oil here to sell for $35/bl and not market value. Plus, where are the protesters at CN/CP Rail Lines?
9620 2018-04-09 03:54:00 Massive traffic at indian oil near delhi cantt, and at hanuman mandir near domestic airport...Spent 25 Min. Still in traffic @DelhiPolice @dtptraffic .
9621 2018-04-09 03:53:56 coconut oil is a major key
9622 2018-04-09 03:53:52 Ok so please name a better option available? Solar? Wind? Tidal? ALL of them come from OIL BY-PRODUCTS.
9623 2018-04-09 03:53:49 Conservatives policies have been really attractive ever since, especially the energy sector ones. I dropped Trudeau long ago when he postulated that plans are underway to phase out oil sands.
9624 2018-04-09 03:53:47 I swear me and the O’Reilly employee have the same conversation every time I change my oil and he tells me I’m putting diesel oil in my Subaru and that I shouldn’t. Yes Im aware and no it’s not hurting my car I’ve been running it since I bought the car
9625 2018-04-09 03:53:22 frfr..oil me tf up with that shiii
9626 2018-04-09 03:53:18 Hey twitter algorithm why am I seeing ads that support Big Oil companies trying to make them family friendly and an integral part of allowing young girls to enter the STEAM fields when...I dunno...they’re fucking terrible?
9627 2018-04-09 03:53:07 Misogyny and snake oil psycho babble bullshit. What a wonderful combination. It's a good thing he isn't just selling his own "significance" to make money and maintain his cult status.
9628 2018-04-09 03:53:07 It is oil u even define it as such. Hence the laughing... you don't know what you arguing.
9629 2018-04-09 03:52:55 Can smell the happy oil from the pic

9632 2018-04-09 03:52:15 You are wrong. If you are against oil and protest it’s use and distribution don’t use it. You should have said if you are against roads don’t use them. You make no sense. You are a hypocrite.
9633 2018-04-09 03:52:10 Also the reason is that China doesnt have Nuclear powered Warships
So they depend on oil and there is a significant amount of oil being used to reach Indian ocean as well as being reserved for return.
So having a Naval presence in Indian ocean is not practical for them now.
9634 2018-04-09 03:52:01 @KasieDC was reading today  that there was a major oil leak at the Keystone XL pipe line in North Dakota. Haven’t heard anything from the EPA
9635 2018-04-09 03:52:01 Go ahead admit it you used oil today

9642 2018-04-09 03:51:17 ... not oil. Dilbit. Let’s be clear. Next: Energy East- decent project. Took unrefined product and upgraded it in value-add way, would have mitigated import of dirty/sketchy stuff.  I don’t have much concern over tankers and pipelines. Just poor economics and 19th century tech
9643 2018-04-09 03:51:17 6 WASH YOUR FACE
 
-   Wash your face in the morning when you wake up and before you go to bed  to get rid of excess dirt and oil.  Also frequently wash your pillow cases  because they will have your face oil  on them and you do not want to put your clean face on oil 
9644 2018-04-09 03:51:14 In the plus side of the torture the kids hair definitely grew several inches. S/o to doo gro, castor oil and protective styles 
9645 2018-04-09 03:51:13 it's already written it's in the constitution of our province that Alberta can turn off the taps to any province in Canada we hold the rights to the oil and gas and have a say on where it goes. They used it on Ottawa several years ago #turnoffthetaps #shutdownBC
9646 2018-04-09 03:51:06 So logically then... We should get   oil from countries that do allow and accept oil spills on their coastline? Out of sight/mind.. The is no economic benefit to BC residence from Alberta Oil...still same $/litre to them?
9647 2018-04-09 03:50:57 nilagyan ko ng chili oil yung extra hot pancit tapos parang nabawasan yung anghang wth
9648 2018-04-09 03:50:41 I thought after Harper bailed the auto industry out with Canadian taxpayer money, they were ours.
Obviously the oil industry is wildly persecuted, the poor wee defenseless things.
Couldn't have anything to do with the nature of the product.
9649 2018-04-09 03:50:33 1. WA States shipping prevention and oil recovery has been world class since Exxon Valdez. Canada has what? 2. WA State has fleets of Escort Tugs and ERTV's. Canada has what. 3. POVan 3rd largest port in NA doesn't have these yet! 4. WA State taxpayers don't pay!
9650 2018-04-09 03:50:29 Having a pounding headache when your trying to go to sleep isnt fun. But what makes it worse is when you accidently get essential oil in your eye on top of the headache, and it  really makes you reevaluate where your life is going
9651 2018-04-09 03:50:26 I just realized America's war in the Middle East is not just about oil, it's about POC. POC Genocide is part of the neocons global eugenics agenda
9652 2018-04-09 03:50:15 yeah lies hurt, but have you ever gotten peppermint essential oil in your eye
9653 2018-04-09 03:50:15 all of my oil spilled

9659 2018-04-09 03:49:26 Why from the end of the rule? It should be average, of each term, separately. If anything Modi had many things working for him and he screwed it. Ridiculously low oil prices, good global economy and absolute majority. Still gave mediocre results at best...

9662 2018-04-09 03:49:07 Freeze Russian Oligarchs money in Germany? Why hasn't Germany done that already since most of it is in the EU.  Angela Merkel is Obama's bff and she won't/didn't do shit against Putin because he will cut off her oil and gas and her economy collapses!  Same with most of the EU...

9671 2018-04-09 03:47:44 I'm particularly enjoying all the suggestions that landlocked Alberta (& maybe Saskatchewan) consider separating from Canada because it can't get its oil to tidewater in the Canadian federation.
9672 2018-04-09 03:47:33 The war re: Syria, Russia etc is about an oil pipeline that Russia is building or already did before Trump became Prez and built them here....Russia thought they would supply the world's oil and keep Europe freezing without it.
9673 2018-04-09 03:47:06 sometimes in my head, all i hear is myself internally screaming at myself to be productive, like boo you got homework, clean your room, drop and give me 50, change your oil, don’t you have laundry to do, please get your shit together sarah
9674 2018-04-09 03:47:04 Broadly speaking, I agree, but the bulk of available evidence strongly points to Russia having gotten involved only reluctantly, when it appeared clear that Syria would become the next Libya without Russian intervention (solicited by the Syrian govt., BTW). Yes, oil/gas is huge..
9675 2018-04-09 03:46:49 I come home in 2 days so @Jordanshells1 better get to drinkin some castor oil
9676 2018-04-09 03:46:42 Roman is a handsome oil slick.
9677 2018-04-09 03:46:41 Mayne time to move away from oil as much as possible. And yes, the research has indicated that the oil from the tar sands if far dirtier than any from elsewhere - short term jobs for long term destruction makes no sense. But you'll just chalk up people wanting a future to spite.

9681 2018-04-09 03:46:14 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
9682 2018-04-09 03:46:14 I work in marketing, I don't work for an oil and gas company. I am 100% supportive of the pipeline because it will bring much needed tax revenue to AB.

9685 2018-04-09 03:45:40 Came back from Florida trip & toured steel plants on threat of tariff, does nothing on pipelines. So in East Saudi oil is used, AB &SK sell oil half price to US BC uses AB oill...all in a country that easily could b self-sufficient and make huge $$$ from abundant resources
9686 2018-04-09 03:45:37 Curiously the AB govt has long claimed that the oil resource is ours and ours alone. But when another province exerts sovereignty over its territory, suddenly we're federalists?

9721 2018-04-09 03:41:50 Anger the crowd with a 10 yr old becoming a tag champion and follow it with Reigns vs Lesnar??? Isn't that like throwing oil on a fire?? #WrestleMania
9722 2018-04-09 03:41:49 They should make a mini fenty body lava cos my ass can't commit to a $60 body oil
9723 2018-04-09 03:41:45 an article just came out that Miami will flood everyday by 2070. I guess that means the same for Vancouver. What is the cost of all the mitigation? More than all the oil in Alberta would be my guess. A loss for Canada.
9724 2018-04-09 03:41:35 Baby boomers are retiring, that is a non issue. And house prices are no higher now than they were 50 years ago in relation to wages. Problem is young people want to start their life in New homes. Oil is needed so everyone has a job to live.

9727 2018-04-09 03:41:17 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9728 2018-04-09 03:41:16 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9730 2018-04-09 03:40:46 Excellent. Keep us posted. Matches my fundamental view that the Fed needs higher oil for higher inflation expectations in order to justify more rate hikes.
9731 2018-04-09 03:40:41 And by devil, we mean, "They think they should get to keep their land and oil."

9734 2018-04-09 03:40:18 WRONG WRONG ; 90% of Van clean products are from Alberta. Cherry Pt is a short term truck supply only. Wash also gets approx 40% of refined product from Ab in the KM line. Only real export is bitumin. I perform product fuel audits on KM/TM on behalf of oil companies so I DO KNOW.

9738 2018-04-09 03:40:06 You're likely right. Interesting how oil is "Evil" until it is beneficial in some way, and as you say, not straight out of the ground/barrel.
9739 2018-04-09 03:39:58 Undercutting Russian state-owned oil companies by selling our domestic energy to European countries (allowing them to turn back on Russia) is one thing... Your suggesting an actual WAR with Russia? Wtf?

9742 2018-04-09 03:39:31 Comparing the navigational issues of Amsterdam to Vancouver and the route to open water? Look again. The ships are planned to be super tankers not costal tankers. What are the oil spill responses in Amsterdam, none in Vancouver.

9744 2018-04-09 03:39:25 It’s interesting if CN or CP wanted to twin their track through BC so they could carry more oil tanker trains to port would there be all this debate? I don’t think anyone would even notice. Pipelines are sexy in all the wrong ways.
9745 2018-04-09 03:39:24 @jjhorgan Please continue to stand with those of us who value the environment. The proposed pipeline is fraught with issues, from desecrating Indigenous traditional lands to the inevitable oil spills along our coast damaging wildlife and industry. #StopKM #ProtectOurCoasts
9746 2018-04-09 03:39:22 But I thought oil was a myth created by the Clinton administration to cover up their drunken karaoke habit and allies in the Middle East

9752 2018-04-09 03:38:20 that might be to hard to understand for some folks though. if it's not oil straight out the barrel/ground then the by-products don't count (pretty sure that's their logic)
9753 2018-04-09 03:37:52 does castor oil work

9756 2018-04-09 03:37:35 Except nobody in their right mind honestly believes that the NEB did a proper impact assess job, no proponent offers real #s that include all lifecycle costs & dilbit isn't oil.

9758 2018-04-09 03:37:05 Isn't Iran's oil cheaper to produce? Our oil is more expensive to extract, wouldn't countries looking to buy it go for the cheaper stuff regardless? And hey, they've only got enough reserves for 100 years, Saudis are looking at 60, we'll outlive em? ;)

9785 2018-04-09 03:33:53 Beyond the picket fences and the oil wells, the happy endings, and the fairy tales, is the reality of shattered lives and broken dreams.
9786 2018-04-09 03:33:53 You don't want Alberta oil & gas. We in Alberta will make that possible very soon. I'm sure your constituents will appreciate the $2-$3 per liter that follows. Let see what the price of groceries is like in BC after that.
9787 2018-04-09 03:33:50 Just curious, but what are your plans for alternative industries? You know, in case oil and gas become redundant again.
9788 2018-04-09 03:33:49 Grandkids are too important to worry about the tar sands.  Save it for when oil is gone and we need some, if we do.  A liveable earth is more important.
9789 2018-04-09 03:33:48 I like the salad but fuck the croutons they are just unnecessary. It is just like eating a salad with ranch instead of just some olive oil and vinegar.

9802 2018-04-09 03:31:22 coconut oil is essential.
9803 2018-04-09 03:31:22 This is bullshit Naomi. Far fewer than 50% of British Columbians oppose the pipeline. Oil well cleanup has to come out of public funds and billions spent on Site C are you're "clean  energy", Al the while Canada imports millons of BPD from paragons like Venezuela and Saudi
9804 2018-04-09 03:31:17 So black every time you get out the car the oil light come on
9805 2018-04-09 03:31:08 its really interesting that when we started having trouble was the same time oil started becoming a problem in American Politics...there were even Muslims who fought during our revolutionary war! the very 1st country to recognize the United States of America was Muslim Morocco!
9806 2018-04-09 03:31:08 Unfortunately that is a secondary goal of the criminals who rule America after regime change & control of the Syrian oil pipeline. Of course they'll say Russia did it without evidence or investigation because it's likely US/Israel funded ISIS factions behind it.
9807 2018-04-09 03:31:07 is this tweet robber? and to put oil on fire you omitted dupty @RaziDada
9808 2018-04-09 03:30:57 Try using products free of frangance I moisturize with pure raw virgin olive oil after I wash up it helps me

9810 2018-04-09 03:30:34 Bloomjew idiot writers said something again. All this is going to do is make Iran sell oil in currency other than the green back which is the entire premise of Iran deal to keep the petrodollar printing press going.  So sanctions help no one.

9814 2018-04-09 03:30:08 Ain’t shit slick to a can of oil 
9815 2018-04-09 03:30:05 So we should purchase and use oil from any other country cause it’s a necessity and have it shipped in by tankers but we should not get our product to tidal waters because pipelines are dangerous?
9816 2018-04-09 03:29:57 1/ I'm not sure this is primary objective of the yuan oil/gold contract. IMO China, Russia, etc. want to completely bypass the USD for their oil trade. Oil exporters not (yet) ok to hold surplus in yuan, so enter yuan gold contract that offers immediate convertibility.
9817 2018-04-09 03:29:53 It's not about the oil anymore. New options. Syria is charred. As Bill pointed out a bit ago, Roths want Assad gone. Prob so. Combo of things at this point.. $, war, making Trump look bad, distraction. Classic  tactics that are so obvious only the  will believe it.
9818 2018-04-09 03:29:52 Nobody objected when US oil companies (and SunCor) popped the cork on the new Hebron oil field off the east coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Yea, lots of offshore drilling, oil tankers, and plans for more out east. Where are the eco-crazies on that file? Crapping on AB it seems.
9819 2018-04-09 03:29:46 Public/WIKI side: Arab Spring led to Syrian civil war, US supported Rebels, ISIL/ISIS encroached, coalition efforts to combat Islamic State. Some rebels split to side with Turkey, US sides with Kurdish Rebels (holding key oil fields) being attacked by Turkey and Syria (Assad)...
9820 2018-04-09 03:29:29 The Pipeline Dream is dead,Trudeau will be happy along with BC. NDP will look at other ways to tax Albertans. Alberta oil is land-lock.

9824 2018-04-09 03:29:06 It’s simple. There’s no money in keeping things alive that get in the way of things like pipelines, oil fields, trees that can be harvested, etc.

9828 2018-04-09 03:27:47 All the money in the world could not repair the damage to our coastline from dirty Alberta oil.  What would it cost BC if we lost the tourist revenue from people who come to enjoy its beauty?  What about the entire salmon industry?
9829 2018-04-09 03:27:42 He's never going to be able to take any of it back. Everything he said, everything he did, all the idiotic and disgusting things her said will be out there forever. I hope this finally discredits him. Snake oil salesman and prime manipulator.
9830 2018-04-09 03:27:31 He can't do that he's going to drive home, cook a steak on his gas bbq before he goes inside to watch his oil based plastic tv and tweet on his plastic phone.
9831 2018-04-09 03:27:28 Everyone know US DOS is working w/Soros White Helmets in Syria staging these false attacks so Pentagon can go in & take the oil.

9834 2018-04-09 03:27:10 Great. We can go back to the trains and the record amounts of oil spills that gas caused. Even list a whole town in Quebec by using rail
9835 2018-04-09 03:27:03 The interests of Seattle boardrooms seem acceptable to influence #bcpoli decisions. The 500 oil supertankers that enter the Salish Sea every year to supply WA refineries and BC gas stations never get airplay. Why? Inconvenient truth? Counter to the “save the coast” rhetoric ?

9851 2018-04-09 03:25:16 Alberta should separate from Canada and become an American state.  Albertans know Americans want the oil, they're building a massive pipeline already and know that Canadians in both directions don't want anything to do with oil and gas which drives Alberta's economy.
9852 2018-04-09 03:25:14 まじ
9853 2018-04-09 03:25:13 never. I don’t eem use butter really. I use the lil vegetable oil spray. Healthy ho
9854 2018-04-09 03:24:59 I’ve been in the oil business for 15+ years. I have performed clean ups and dealt with EPA. Whether is 25 gallons or a million bbls the clean up is the same.
9855 2018-04-09 03:24:59 @JustinTrudeau you really need to rethink this. Your losing us supporters in BC. 300,000 a day is enough. Let's move on o a new economy now to after all the oil is gone, Vancouver is underwater and Alberta is scorched earth. It's what you promised. The oilmen are the dinosaurs.

9862 2018-04-09 03:23:42 Maybe what's really needed is an adult discussion about climate change and what needs to be done to prevent it.  Not too mention the plunging costs of renewable energy and the effects on the prices of heavy oil.
9863 2018-04-09 03:23:19 Steve, from one Marine to another, I work in the oil and gas industry for 35 years now. The man that told you about the evils of FRACKING lied. Please look it up, we stopped using harmful chemicals year ago
9864 2018-04-09 03:23:11 The dirt will be scooped up and taken to a facility that heats the soil which turns b the oil loose from the soil...in the meantime fresh soil will be trucked in to replace that which was contaminated...this will cost the oil company bunches
9865 2018-04-09 03:23:04 can someone tell the oil in my hair to calmmm tf down

9867 2018-04-09 03:22:44 from georgia, tennessee, or some parts of texas. maybe alabama if i’m feeling spicy enough to allow it... you also have to use the word “britches” at least once a week, and have to know what the phrase “now we’re cookin in peanut oil” means. 

it’s a lifestyle, really.
9868 2018-04-09 03:22:44 Oil on head.  Yes, sir.
9869 2018-04-09 03:22:41 I put WAY too many drops of oil in my diffuser 
9870 2018-04-09 03:22:15 i basically letak tea tree oil tu dekat satu muka
9871 2018-04-09 03:22:08 Why is lemon balm oil so expensive? Like what's the distillation process like that makes it so expensive?
9872 2018-04-09 03:22:01 Stocks on defense and oil, will truly bless from our suffocating children.
9873 2018-04-09 03:22:00 3 Natural Remedies @TheAltDaily I AM 80, MY MOM.ALWAYS PUT WARM " SWEET OIL" IN OUR EARS WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. I JUST STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS, BOUGHT A LITTLE BOTTLE. OLD REMEDIES BEST!
9874 2018-04-09 03:21:57 Do you Liberals just make shit up? Can't win an argument so just make it up as you go? ALL OF OBAMA'S SANCTIONS ARE STILL IN AFFECT!
Sanctions don't mean shit to Russia because Germany, France, even Ukraine still BUY Russian OIL. Russia is oil dominant and supplies most of Europe
9875 2018-04-09 03:21:45 In Turkey, an oil tanker crashed into a seaside mansion. The name of the tanker was the SS Spirit Airlines.
9876 2018-04-09 03:21:33 I don't think you understand my total concern. It's not just a few buckets of sand to cover some small amounts of oil ( or even some larger amounts). It's so much more!! I doubt you would agree, but thanks for your input.
9877 2018-04-09 03:21:30 This coconut oil has my skin feeling like I’m fresh out my mama’s womb
9878 2018-04-09 03:21:28 It's gear oil... Tranny fluid is offensive
9879 2018-04-09 03:21:28 I would say it's oil related. More the transportation of oil as in pipelines. Why else would we fight in a desert. Africa has many of the same problems yet we don't involve ourselves near as much.
9880 2018-04-09 03:21:22 Companies will just leave and take those high paying middle class jobs with them. Meanwhile we'll keep selling oil to US half price and importing Saud Arabia oil.
9881 2018-04-09 03:21:19 iraq was fought on the WMD Lie anyway.that was the 2nd war. In Gulf war 1 was the incubator Lie. Fun Fact: Saddam Hussein informed the U.S. & prez Bush1, that he would invade Kuweit (they were slant drilling oil from Iraq=theft & were former iraq territory) Bush1 did not object
9882 2018-04-09 03:21:17 Enough talk.  Start doing! Use your constitutional authority to enforce what's good for Canada.  If you don't, then it is the end of Canada as there's no value in a federation.  Just a bunch of feudal feuding provinces. Alberta will separate and ration your oil and gas.
9883 2018-04-09 03:21:05 Where can I order the cdb oil?
9884 2018-04-09 03:21:01 Because of that sweet oil money
9885 2018-04-09 03:20:52 当たったことない
9886 2018-04-09 03:20:45 So why would @RachelNotley want to tarnish “her” backyard?  If another province had started drilling for oil, d’ya think Albertans would have stood by silently watching?
9887 2018-04-09 03:20:39 Just keep buying oil from the US or Saudi - it’s just so much better then the bad Alberta oil.
9888 2018-04-09 03:20:38 I need to invest in a heater for the garage for when I do oil changes on Deidre’s car when it’s -30 out in April.
9889 2018-04-09 03:20:25 Los metales seguirán tendencialmente al oil siempre y cuando el dxy nos dé una mano.
9890 2018-04-09 03:20:21 they hit issa whole collarbone wit baby oil for this music video
9891 2018-04-09 03:20:20 You didn’t even know what an oil refinery was till I told you, you’ll never be a true Oklahoman
9892 2018-04-09 03:20:19 2) those in that middle ground do include oil companies operating in oil sands that recognize they need to be “energy companies” not “oil companies”. Enbridge for example is a major invested in wind in AB.
9893 2018-04-09 03:20:14 We can do this one tweet at. Time forget bc shut the tap off move more grain through there I’ll bet the people in  Churchill will like it gets some off our oil to tide water and maybe moves some mor grain looks like bc does not want it
9894 2018-04-09 03:20:12 That sounds like cuck talk! None of that now!
You pound that so hard like you are digging for oil!
9895 2018-04-09 03:20:05 Forget y’all that use this wild growth oil! Not once did y’all say this stuff ... smells like blue star ointment.
9896 2018-04-09 03:19:48 真面目（ツイ廃）
9897 2018-04-09 03:19:38 I heard tea tree oil was really beneficial for oral health, so I started adding a bit to my toothpaste. Lets see if I notice any difference
9898 2018-04-09 03:19:37 If we hike capital gains then I wonder how many companies will move their HQs? All of the oil companies could move to TX. MidFirst to Arizona. Not sure how many other HQs we have here. I wonder why we couldn’t get Amazon to build here.

9905 2018-04-09 03:18:46 Rick, Canada is a net exporter of oil. By far. The oil industry itself (refiners) decide where they are getting their feedstock from. They make business decisions.
9906 2018-04-09 03:18:43 I get that. Two quick things before I plug the phone for the night. 1) not just debate between greens and oilers as you put it, but climate concerned people that do think we need oil in short term even if we have to have long term transition. That nuance is entirely lost imo
9907 2018-04-09 03:18:41 smelling like coconut oil 
9908 2018-04-09 03:18:36 Coconut oil really the best..
9909 2018-04-09 03:18:35 @WBrettWilson  JT u gave more money to foreign countries while Alberta suffered. Green jobs like picking bottles off the road. U stepped for the steel industry, but shuned oil industry while taking the money for 'have not' provinces. You had no green plan.
9910 2018-04-09 03:18:30 Every 5d, the Sun provides Earth w as much energy as ALL proven supplies of oil, coal AND natural gas.
If we capture just 1 part in 6,000 in available solar energy, we’d be able to meet 100 percent of earth's energy needs.

9911 2018-04-09 03:18:27 I use to really like him until I found out he was with the oil line going threw native land that’s not cool
9912 2018-04-09 03:18:13 Russia are our allies. They are being demonized by those in power who desire West Asian oil & natural gas supplies.
9913 2018-04-09 03:18:01 oil, gas, pipelines? Kabuki?
9914 2018-04-09 03:17:56 And I was out here thinking he was talking about some beard oil smh
9915 2018-04-09 03:17:43 Cabal and black hats want control of the oil pipelines and Syria indebted to them like many other eastern nations???  Power and control.
9916 2018-04-09 03:17:38 As long we using oil, how
9917 2018-04-09 03:17:09 台湾やべえの？
9918 2018-04-09 03:17:00 Same reason we're anywhere in the ME.  Oil.
9919 2018-04-09 03:16:46 Oooh! Didn't they fight butt naked and covered in olive oil?
9920 2018-04-09 03:16:46 Google Zapata Oil.
9921 2018-04-09 03:16:45 Alleged trash? You’re an idiot. The Army Corp of Engineers had to weigh it in order to bill The People. It’s unfortunate about the oil spill last November, but the hypocrisy of the protest was counter productive due to a few, not all, of the protesters that trashed the property.
9922 2018-04-09 03:16:43 I need to be rubbed head to toe & in between with some coconut oil, a bomb playlist in the background on a soft bed w a blunt in my hand and some bangles lit. Lil shit
9923 2018-04-09 03:16:43 try 99 fucking percent of the province. but wait you must be one of those live entirely off the land, don't rely on oil and gas products to live
9924 2018-04-09 03:16:36 I pondered oil since Genie oil has been there for a while.
9925 2018-04-09 03:16:35 What I am starting to ask is what in flint is so important that they want. Because, like puerto rico, the active anti help these places are getting has a purpose, we just dont know yet what it is. Puerto rico as a rich persons playground of course but flint...idk. Oil? Gas?
9926 2018-04-09 03:16:31 Newfoundland seemed to lean too heavily on a few years of great oil revenue at the expense of the traditional fisheries. What’s happened to cod stocks is a crime.
9927 2018-04-09 03:16:30 And coconut oil oh god
9928 2018-04-09 03:16:23 Gonna be cranking up the fuel on the 300D tomorrow after the oil change  might also see about cranking up the boost, need to do more research on that.
9929 2018-04-09 03:15:36 The existing pipeline is unique, it can ship different products such as gasoline, diesel crude!  Chevron refinery has to bring in crude by rail due to pipeline capacity!  One would think that a new pipeline would free up space to ship more gasoline and oil for chevron
9930 2018-04-09 03:15:15 It’s like saying oil painting and paper mache are the same thing and artists shouldn’t care that they are forced to pick one.
9931 2018-04-09 03:15:13 Tea: thanks or best friends with caramel, smoked salmon, garlic onion dip mix, rosemary olive oil crackers, Mediterranean sea salt
9932 2018-04-09 03:15:09 Ok let’s start this man sask ab pipeline to Churchill and fix the rail line ya it’s a shorter window but it will work oil there grain there shut the tap off
9933 2018-04-09 03:15:06 If AB gov pays 4 all direct/indirect dmge claims bc of oil spills, and holds CEOs personally responsible. go 4 it. Why no local refinery 2?
9934 2018-04-09 03:15:03 If I become an oil baron, I won’t spend this wealth on a soccer team
9935 2018-04-09 03:15:02 Development by BJP 4 yrs in Railways, Roads, Electricity, Fertilizer, Jute & Textile industry Jobs, Revised Oil, Gas and Petroleum price tie up with Gulf, International relationship. If this all done in 4 yrs then just imagine India''s development if BJP comes again in 2019.
9936 2018-04-09 03:14:55 This just in from the "JESUS! GET A ROOM!" department:

Senator Gene Yaw once gave Cabot Oil & Gas an award just because Gov. Corbett gave Cabot an award*! 

(*2016 Governor's ImPAct award. Yeah, Cabot caused some Impacts, that's for sure)
9937 2018-04-09 03:14:55 GIRL WHYY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG TO GET AN OIL CHANGE WAITING ONLY MAKES IT WORSE 
9938 2018-04-09 03:14:46 Looks klike the protesters won;t stop blocking #TransMountain and do not want oil on the coast or a repeat of #ExxonValez. Anyway i doubt the validity of that so called "poll" British Columbia has the right to say no oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

9940 2018-04-09 03:14:40 Except for a complete failure to do anything to insulate the province from the inevitable downturns in the oil economy...

9944 2018-04-09 03:13:27 you can get an oil change from my guy for like $20. i think it’s like $25 max.

9950 2018-04-09 03:12:52 This is the cause of using everydrop of oil, from my phone, wifi, fan, fridge, stove and my car.
9951 2018-04-09 03:12:33 Funny how everybody in Alberta is a shareholder yet you forgot to actually get any meaningful dividends as a bulwark against a future with less oil work, like Norway did. Maybe Alberta is a bad board member and should be removed.
9952 2018-04-09 03:12:32 Replacing these unhealthy saturated/trans fats with unsaturated fats can lower LDL levels and even raise HDL levels. Eat lots of nuts, fish, and oil from plants! It’s important to know what fats are going in your body so you can control your cholesterol and your heart
9953 2018-04-09 03:12:30 Dude,  you’re defending a war monger.  The guy is a coward who ducked out of vietnam, but he will send your kids to die in a desert we don’t belong in fighting for oil and Israel.  the war mongers
9954 2018-04-09 03:12:30 All this mental masturbation and high fantasy is going on about “cutting BC off”. It’s not happening. Is a Prov. Gov’t going to tell oil, rail and trucking companies they can’t ship? Even if they did, the Federal gov’t would end it in 5 minutes. #abpoli

9961 2018-04-09 03:10:50 It's about oil and gas
9962 2018-04-09 03:10:43 We have to keep them in check it's very important because Russia will move in with Syria to Israel and take the oil
9963 2018-04-09 03:10:37 Lol that’s not what I’m arguing. It’s not fracking so you can’t label it that as really “bad” for the environment. Gas taken from the oil fields doesn’t  use invasive water extraction process. Natural gas is a good energy fuel. Solar and nuclear are good too.
9964 2018-04-09 03:10:37 Your brain capacity is broken. Did oil become less valuable overnight? You think other companies wont invest? What in the fuck qualifies you to talk about pipelines? What area of expertise do you possess that we should listen to a word you're saying right now?

9983 2018-04-09 03:08:32 What measures?
There are no such measures - just "best in the world" band-aids that we already know can't handle the job even with oil instead of dilbit.
It's like handing out handkerchiefs - and claiming they're parachutes (but hey, they're the best handkerchiefs in the world!).
9984 2018-04-09 03:08:21 I know Albertans are kinda stupid but who gives a fuck about kinder morgan? It's oil, there are literally dozens of companies that can build pipelines. Dont worry, once we figure out the legal bullshit it'll be built by someone. Till then stop crying. You look stupid...er

9990 2018-04-09 03:07:17 I’m aware of its use. My point is that getting Canada’s oil to tidal waters is good for our nation. Our imported oil is brought to us by tankers and pipelines. Do your homework brah
9991 2018-04-09 03:07:10 Oil ลง แต่เหมือน ptt pttep จะไม่ลงตามสักเท่าไหร่
9992 2018-04-09 03:07:07 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
9993 2018-04-09 03:07:05 We have tried vacumming these beetles, luring pouches of cloves and bay leaves up, wiping down walls with citrus disinfectant and Now dowsing my room with citrus essentiel oil. If this  doesn’t get rid of these bugs, the bugs will have officailly gotten rid of me. 
9994 2018-04-09 03:06:56 Blah blah blah. BC exports 30+ million tons of coal annually to Asia so clearly it’s not about saving the planet! 98 million barrels of oil moves around the globe daily in tankers with no spills. Uninformed people like you are the problem!

9997 2018-04-09 03:06:39 Youre thinking of 'traitor'. Also, most are probably concerned about the environmental impacts of using oil from tar sands - it's not people trying to block someone else ou of spite. Pity if you feel that way.
9998 2018-04-09 03:06:28 Top scientists to politicians: You need to keep the oil *in the ground*
Politicians to scientists: We’ll build more pipelines

Top technologists to politicians: AI will cause a massive job losses & autonomous weapons will threaten society 
Politicians: Let’s invest heavily in AI

I will fear no evil for you are with me, your rod and your staff, Comforts me.
 You prepare a table before me, in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil,my cup overflows.
10000 2018-04-09 03:05:37 Lol stop flexing. It’s from the hard water , also ion really oil myself after showers
10001 2018-04-09 03:05:33 Why not protect the BC coast and all the fisheries, and start up Energy East. So then the oil is refined by people with worker protection and worker rights? Please respond @JustinTrudeau @jimcarr_wpg @rachelnotely, @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC
10002 2018-04-09 03:05:21 @Saudi_Aramco I think it is a good idea to build many many more oil and gas companies in the whole world and in the whole universe and beyond and in the whole multiverse and beyond. But more money are needed to build more oil and gas companies.

10005 2018-04-09 03:04:55 The fact is while Obama was neglecting the US military and US oil, Putin was rebuilding Russia's military, exporting oil, taking the offensive in Ukraine, Syria, the Arctic, Crimea, hacking the @DNC and screwing with our election regime. 

Mueller is investigating the wrong guy.

10007 2018-04-09 03:04:36 Did DJT bomb anyone today? What oil was stolen today? What regime change took place today? The only thing that *actually*  happened today was your display of disloyalty over nothing.
10008 2018-04-09 03:04:30 Obviously if the rich investors are not seeing future profits the government would invest taxpayer money while subsidized oil producers pay less royalties lol
10009 2018-04-09 03:04:13 What does a person’s resume look like after shilling for Trump and not even believing it when they’re shilling?

“At my previous position, I assisted in the Marketing and Promotion of Snake Oil. Flexible with morals and allegiances. Willing to travel.”

@SportsnetSpec this would be a good move for the Oil
10011 2018-04-09 03:04:07 Tip from @LynetteCenee: a drop of olive oil on cuticles makes nails grow faster. #manicure
10012 2018-04-09 03:03:45 You are burning midnight oil to keep our Party in a fight during upcoming election....it's very good.
We will give reservation to those journalist whom BJP term as fake reporter...
And that responsibility is yours to identify our Warrior reporters.
Jai Congress.
10013 2018-04-09 03:03:25 Sure it would send ripples to the economy, but it wouldn't destroy the whole economy like what happened in Venezuela. Why weren't there any companies doing something else in Venezuela? It' s not like oil is their only resources. Might it be because Chavez was directing everything
