43 2018-01-21 21:32:59 Ulol. It seems di mo alam ang mangyayari with the TRAIN. Yes, you will have a not-so big THP, but the prices of commodities will all increase for the next 3-5 years and that we be a big hurt to all filipinos. Don't be stupid, read the neg effects of TRAIN. Huwag magpa-GAGO.
44 2018-01-21 21:27:26 I believe it follows AMZ strategy of doing retail where commodities are sold with rich selection, seamlessly & with unprecedented convenience backed by data recognition. Thus, exposing retailers who just sell “stuff” with no added value.  Too many retailers are just middlemen.

48 2018-01-21 21:14:31 For most, buying commodities like broadband is transactional. Many of us feel deeply connected to home and neighbourhood in a way that extends beyond exchanging money for a service. Yet for tenants, switching landlord isn’t an option. Hardly surprising many want to get involved?

50 2018-01-21 21:12:27 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
51 2018-01-21 21:04:27 That’s a great look. All these possible confirming signs in commodities getting me giddy.
52 2018-01-21 21:00:39 @Matt_Hougan Long term returns of alternative #ETFs, such as commodity ETFs may not be what you expect because you're not actually buying commodities, but commodity futures

55 2018-01-21 20:39:00 Sadly I agree.  They have made many statements where they describe us as commodities, to be used and discarded by the British. But we are people!
56 2018-01-21 20:20:36 Actual question is whether the amazon branding actually helps or hurts in these categories. It’s usually synonymous for generic low end commodities. In food that’s prob not a good thing?

60 2018-01-21 19:41:56 I think this one was posted by Chris Kimble. Not sure. Either way commodities are cheap and Silver is very cheap vs gold. Many Silver names breaking out. $FSM $WPM. Will take a look to see what you mean.....

65 2018-01-21 19:09:49 In the last 6 months the amount of money a truck driver can make hauling local produced commodities has increased substantially. I can finally afford to paint my house and repair the deck but I’ll have to hire illegals since all my legit friends and I are swamped with work.

68 2018-01-21 18:48:54 After Indy ASDA, Tesco and all the big retailers will still be trading here, the London Commodities Exchange will be begging to still trade Scottish oil and they will need our electricity to keep their lights on, except we won’t be hit with highest grid fees!
69 2018-01-21 18:36:37 How much copper is needed for EVs?   How much nickel?  2x current production?   How much cobalt? 4x current production?  These commodities come out of the ground.  Mining.  Digging.  How much diesel is needed?
70 2018-01-21 18:17:07 Yes you are correct why would our Gov award them for breaking the law as you can see in my post that they are bringing them here in droves and relocating them throughout the U.S. anotherwards they don't give a shit what Americans want we are just commodities to be used !!!

74 2018-01-21 17:58:26 The fact that minorities have been viewed as commodities and not people is still with us today. Until we see everyone as an equal - some will still view those that are different as objects, to be controlled. It’s sickening.

79 2018-01-21 17:44:49 I interprete "be a wife" as an euphemism for "Be the person that you would want to date/marry" And this applies to men too! It's sad that we live in this patriarchal society where women have to polished, desirable commodities.

5. Shattered dreams & hopes,
6. Disregard of the Constitution.

97 2018-01-21 15:19:58 Moral inflation occurs when you pay a disproportionate moral price in exchange for certain commodities basic to human pride and dignity .Under Buhari govt in Nigeria it may come to a point when one may be required to seek official permission to make love to his wife or husband.
98 2018-01-21 15:08:47 There have been hundreds of commodities/instruments that have been the underlying in futures trading that simply no longer exist. They will ALWAYS take a stab a new instrument.
99 2018-01-21 15:01:32 Rare commodities are worth more than good
100 2018-01-21 15:00:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
101 2018-01-21 14:53:58 Here is my long term prediction for Bitcoin. It will establish itself as the commodity of all commodities in terms of stored value and not as a payment processor, too slow for merchant adoption . Governments will adopt  and use as a new "Gold Standard".
102 2018-01-21 14:48:17 @johnpavlovitz Thank you for sharing from your heart. You have given so much love, honesty, & strength - rare commodities these days.

109 2018-01-21 14:27:48 The problem is people treating animals as things, objects, stock, property, slaves, commodities, instead of what they are: living fellow sentient beings who value their lives as we do ours.

111 2018-01-21 14:19:18 Just came across this pod - enjoyed it. Interesting points especially on being an export nation/pan-africanism. Being an export lead economy is actually a great thing - the focus however should be on exporting value added items not raw commodities.
112 2018-01-21 14:18:09 Haha yeah that’s what I mean, trying to give directions to some of these people that deliver commodities is brutal. All of the truckers like you that are our age understand technology and are easy to deal with lol
113 2018-01-21 13:56:32 Time and attention are precious commodities
114 2018-01-21 13:51:01 Agree. But is Nifty or Sensex represent the diversified market one should look for? Both are so much inclined towards financials and commodities? Should we look to Nifty Next 50 rather than Nifty 50 for long term?

121 2018-01-21 12:58:38 on average commercials wrong in commodities, since they pay insurance to speculators to hedge, especially in classic natural backwardation situations like now. commercials and small traders are on average a cointrarian signal. "hedging pressue" factor really works.
122 2018-01-21 12:50:29 Intelligence and Bateman are increasingly divergent commodities. He and MacWhirter are neck and neck in a losing-the-plot race.
123 2018-01-21 12:50:16 If doctors are now commodities then presumably the government will also pay back the training costs of overseas-trained doctors that work in the NHS long term to the countries concerned?
124 2018-01-21 12:50:16 These animals, who care for their babies and each other, scream when cut & bled or their child taken away, just like you do/would, co-exist with us, not for us. Just b/c we can, we treat them like objects, commodities, like human slaves were (and still are!) treated.
125 2018-01-21 12:47:07 One of the most expensive commodities right now: privacy.
126 2018-01-21 12:46:09 you 'removed' tax from people who earn 250k gross annual income, then spreads that tax like a disease in everday commodities like rice and canned goods.... PUTA PAANO NA YUNG MGA TAONG BELOW MINIMUM WAGE ??!!?? 

you compromised the poor to please the majority.
127 2018-01-21 12:45:54 @CNBCTV18Live Looks like the whole investing and trading community is only speculating what 2018 would bring to the fore.

129 2018-01-21 12:34:28 Truly. Without removing BJP govt. from the Centre, India can not make any progress. BJP is responsible for least industrial growth, unemployment, agrarian crisis, high price of food grains and all essential commodities with rising communal hatred and division amongst people.

Let's flood the streets with commodities and vend.

140 2018-01-21 10:03:22 There you have it, commodities, as I said all along.  All animals have intrinsic worth so killing one is equal to killing another.  Breeding them to use and kill is the ultimate injustice.
141 2018-01-21 10:00:46 Cows are commodities kangaroos are not. What is the greater evil killing a cow or killing a swan.
142 2018-01-21 09:57:17 @_DigitalIndia @NPCI_BHIM 

Wholesale Milk Suppliers from Dairy to Retailer are still not accepting Cheque or Digital Money.

The Reason retail Milk shop are still transacting Cash.

This is same for other Commodities. (Experience from Mumbai)
143 2018-01-21 09:54:29 Employment growth in such quick time after the collapse of the commodities boom is testament to good government. Sluggish wages growth is an international phenomenon exacerbated in Australia by a lag following the “overhang” form exceedingly high wages growth during the boom.
144 2018-01-21 09:41:06 Humans are not bred to be used to produce something and then get sick due to being overbred, overused, etc and then killed because they are no longer profitable.  Don't confuse euthanasia with disposal of unprofitable commodities.
145 2018-01-21 09:25:37 The sci-fi of #darkness is now a reality:

Basic commodities rapidly increased.
Inflation rate increases too. Pweh..!

171 2018-01-21 04:15:41 My question to each panelist: Bull runs in commodities often stem from an unexpected catalyst, a disruptor that analysts didn't see coming, ie. EV boom->Lithium. What disruptive catalysts to fuel a Uranium Bull do you see on the horizon that analysts have missed or dismissed?

I resist because I don’t like taking a back seat while callous and cruel politicians treat human lives like commodities. Like all others who resist, I know this country can be amazing and I want to do my part in making it amazing.
175 2018-01-21 03:31:08 1. I'm just referring to the insane housing rent runups, the wildly inflating food and commodities prices since they let non-producers trade in them, while the steady deflation in other consumer goods continues. Basically, finance piles into everything that the rest of us need.
176 2018-01-21 03:18:49 Poor dog. I really do hate people who mistreat animals or treat them like commodities.

178 2018-01-21 03:00:28 If we like coins/tokens being legal... We want government interactions to be on par with assets or commodities.
179 2018-01-21 02:45:11 All resources belong to everybody. No one will have more than anyone else. So no one will have “more of anything” to determine different values of commodities. In other words, “prices” won’t exist.
180 2018-01-21 02:42:09 I'm just waiting for the next big storm to hit. One time the city (most) was without power for 2 weeks. Riots over ice!!! The most valuable commodities were water, TP, PT, cash, bullets and  propane. Quite an eye opener. So yup we gotta pray. It works wonders.

182 2018-01-21 01:59:43 Some of these like time, sequence, social prefs & bounded cognition issues become fatal to any pref orderings above trivial numbers, especially in conjunction with each other.  I mean they limit our prefs to a very small number of POSSIBLE values & commodities entirely.
183 2018-01-21 01:51:00 Because the market determines what commodities cost. More people value their Phones/Cars/Technology (including medical technology), than their nurses or teachers. Not saying it's right or moral, but it's reality.

239 2018-01-20 21:47:18 since a self-proclaimed "marxist-leninist" quote tweeted this in confusion, i'll elaborate: money as such can only exist, when there is exchange of commodities between owners of private property. with the negation of private property, money ceases to exist.
240 2018-01-20 21:36:08 So many ways to answer that question. Amazon is the next-gen Walmart: primarily a logistics company that strips friction out of assembling then delivering commodities. Atlanta is the US logistics hub and, arguably, the epicentre of the New South.
241 2018-01-20 21:20:54 And this may be an simplistic intuition but my feeling is that we are selling out or most precious commodities, our Values, Resources, Innovative Tech etc in exchange for container ships full of crap to fill our dollar stores.

263 2018-01-20 18:19:37 Oh, of course. Shelf space & time are valuable commodities, I completely get it.
264 2018-01-20 18:13:28 Important lesson to all of the blue bloods with aging coaches. Keep an active shortlist of proven commodities and don’t make a hire in haste. Both UConn and Louisville took leaps of faith on unproven assistants.
265 2018-01-20 17:55:44 Every year India imports agricultural commodities worth more than one lac Crore. Our country has the potential to be self-sufficient and even generate surplus in #Agriculture.

273 2018-01-20 16:58:11 To quote PP&M “when will they ever learn?”  Corporations have shaped the education system to mine our minds for the commodities that they value at the expense of our humanity.  However it is only in encouraging our humanity that the rest of us those skills can develop.
274 2018-01-20 16:45:32 Sim, Gusma. Em ano em podem ocorrer oscilações bruscas, small caps são mais arriscadas. Há empresa cíclicas, com elevado beta e atrelada a commodities no cardápio. Citei algumas, vc citou a PETR4 e, estudando com calma, acharmos outras.
275 2018-01-20 16:38:49 O negócio é dinâmico. Eu já estou começando a achar que hora de trocar algumas smallcaps (que já andaram relativamente bem) para empresas ligadas a commodities. Os menores multiplos estão ali. A ver!

277 2018-01-20 16:32:55 @Libropt Gold is more than 1300 dollars an ounce. Farming is an expensive operation and farmers work longer hours than miners. Why should milk be cheaper than gold? Both are valuable commodities.

279 2018-01-20 16:25:53 Most crypto #HODLers don't have a clue what generates wealth long  term...  It ain't currencies nor commodities.  It's real businesses and  real estate that produce steady cash flow and profits.
280 2018-01-20 16:18:24 Because we spend so much food and fuel, the market for other commodities shrinks, and the rate of inflation slows down.

283 2018-01-20 15:55:57 Yeah, because people aren't commodities. We have the power to take collective action to secure better lives for our families, by taking power from capital.
284 2018-01-20 15:49:09 It's only a transfer of wealth if you sell and convert into ownership of real businesses and real estate that produce cash flow and profits. Most crypto #HODL don't have a clue what generates wealth long term...  It ain't currencies nor commodities.
285 2018-01-20 15:47:11 Mas produzimos basicamente commodities, precisamos investir muito em educação para aumentamos a produtividade, fazendo produtos de alto valor agregado, o que vai aumentar a renda per capita e trazer benefícios reais para o povo.
286 2018-01-20 15:42:16 Ta em voga o call de commodities, porque elas estariam, em tese, no low do ciclo. @hbredda, @marciopdn2, @schiavos e o Felipe Miranda da empiricus atentaram pra isso ja há algum tempo.

300 2018-01-20 14:24:00 Just explain one last thing - if I do a Euro Yen swap and my Japanese counterparty wants to clear in London as that’s where all of his other exposures are netted ( commodities /insurance/gold) what will I say ? Oh you can’t do that trade ?
301 2018-01-20 14:18:27 this,
also, the idea there will be no commodities is naive at best. even in post-scarcity there will still be things in limited supply and thus barter and the need for a proxy.
302 2018-01-20 14:11:09 Yeah. I’m so angry to be reminded that women’s bodies are seen as commodities to be taken. I’m angry at feeling powerless. I’m angry that I my initial reaction was disbelief and being frozen.

306 2018-01-20 14:01:46 Hi @KatWoolnough ....we are all consumers. We eat and wear clothes etc etc.  Our society survives by trading goods and services. This isn't sustainable if we treat commodities as disposable. Building a circular economy  and sustainable consumerism that avoids waste  can be a goal
307 2018-01-20 13:51:21 Tokenizing commodities seems more absurd than writing contracts for them?
308 2018-01-20 13:45:15 Why wasn't CHIP funded on its own separate bill?  Children are not commodities to be leveraged in your lopsided deal.

313 2018-01-20 13:16:31 I'm so glad you see what I'm seeing. It's so crazy because traders in Oyingbo and Mushin especially are selling edible commodities just "inside" the dirts.

328 2018-01-20 11:24:22 It will be different as it will become another cycle. Commodities are geared differently in price and their own cycle. An example is oil going up so dramatically will drag inflation up. There are continual signals and reference points. P.s I dont know them all
329 2018-01-20 11:18:30 I'll let you know a secret: Financial experts can't tell the future. Everyday they report in the business news what is going to happen to equities, to commodities, to economies. The next day another group of experts explain why something different happened.

333 2018-01-20 10:37:20 The USD is everyone's favorite liability but no one's favorite asset No one wants to hold the USD but they want to buy companies, commodities, return-free risk bonds, real estate, heck even digital coins that no one really knows where they come from with all USD debt they can
334 2018-01-20 10:34:33 All it would achieve is the splintering of markets and hinder trading in euros and commodities as traders would not be able to cross boarder net positions .

389 2018-01-20 03:56:59 The only hope for the obsessional is the afterlife. To imagine all the endlessly novel commodities as already decaying and depreciating, as Proust and Benjamin did, is perhaps then a cure.

399 2018-01-20 02:38:30 If interested in #investing #stocks/commodities/bonds, #ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are good options. ETFs are the funds tracking almost anything such as stock indices (e.g. #TSX), gold, oil & etc. Even one can profit from #market decline (short position) by buying inverse ETFs!
400 2018-01-20 02:22:03 I too agree in the broader sense, but select ones can outperform. Commodities (iron ore) seems to be rising due to China production cuts and good demand.

I am sitting on mainly debt funds, so gradually adding equity on dips.
401 2018-01-20 02:14:13 The sell off in August 2007 was ferocious. We made marginal new highs after Q3, but I knew we were going lower. 2008 was bizarre, the fantasy of bailouts, FED easing,BRIC/commodities kept the markets from flushing out. Ultimately credit collapsed and equity markets followed.

407 2018-01-20 01:15:37 Nice Jon. A common sense approach that the broad public can access for growing and protecting their assets in stocks/bonds/commodities/cash etc. Logical, and profitable, over time. Do you use hard, limit stops? i.e. pre set or do you enter them as they get triggered?

452 2018-01-19 22:19:19 Like do you see any reason that commodities generally would not start to catch a bid? Grains in particular are in the tank. IMO they are just waiting for a small S/D disruptive event. Drought etc. Beans, bean oil, meal, wheat are building a multi year base.

503 2018-01-19 17:34:57 Mr President Sir, whilst there is need to protect our local manufacturer section 68 which restrict importation of basic commodities is contributing to the shortages of the commodities which in turn calls for less competition to the local manufacturers and that triggers price rise

632 2018-01-19 06:23:04 And owning an asset hoping for rise in price pretty much covers all assets. That's the one similarity they all have, be it crypto, shares, bonds, commodities, real estate, baseball cards. Hence the term "investment", but that's where similarity ends.

641 2018-01-19 04:51:25 Too much hypocrisy you have there, buddy. Your right to set 0 budget to those congressmen who oppose you? We also have the right on that budget you are talking about. It came from our monthly salary, from our consumptions of basic commodities. Imbecile!
642 2018-01-19 04:46:54 Not to mention Mr. Calvert, who delivered a long string of balanced budgets and just started to enjoy the commodities super-cycle when the less fuddy-duddy Brad Wall arrived on the scene and surfed along on that boom until it collapsed.

659 2018-01-19 02:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
660 2018-01-19 02:04:27 The volume doesn’t give it cred. The fact that it’s on a major exchange does. Oats, lumber, OJ = no volume. But still a “real” market. And I know those are actual commodities so it’s maybe not a comparison.

662 2018-01-19 01:52:54 What sucks is I haven't seen Trump convince politicians to control imports for other commodities. Just about everybody in the energy sector threw a shit fit about regulating importing coal and keeping more coal stock for "brownouts" (in which no coal isn't the cause)

666 2018-01-19 01:38:07 Just an observation.

Over the years the vast majority of macro analysis I've ever read regarding the next big thing in markets has without fail proven wrong as other commodities or technologies render the present line of thought obsolete

Worth thinking about re lithium.
667 2018-01-19 01:37:55 also on the topic of self care i think its really important to realise that, even when its hard, it can be simple

668 2018-01-19 01:37:35 These white designers see black people as commodities, especially celebrities. Black is a fashion to them. These black artists be so quick and honored to rep these designers who only see them as a life size doll. A toy that could quickly get thrown aside.
669 2018-01-19 01:32:02 ...just like money has flooded into ETFs for bonds, stocks, commodities. It would flow into crypto ETFs. Larger investor base, liquidity and ease of funds onto Main Street, e.g. people scared of exchanges.
