89 2018-07-19 23:00:41 54% of Americans own stocks in some way (401k, retirement, savings, etc). Stock buybacks lift the market and the economy, make businesses more efficient (because stocks are a form of debt that add costs), allow companies to hire more, etc. It's generally a sign of a good economy.

115 2018-07-19 22:45:14 I thought that bearish rising wedge should appear when the stock is in general downtrend. It's quite opposite to the falling wedges which Stewie likes: those more often appear for uptrending stocks.

120 2018-07-19 22:42:20 Bingo. How is that a middle-class tax cut? I believe ~50% of Americans don’t even own stocks so it’s not like they’ll benefit from that. Bonuses were a nice gift for some but it’s temporary. Workers need meaningful wage increases.

127 2018-07-19 22:35:37 It won't be an economic crash like 2008. Most stocks will dip again but it won't be anything close to back then. This is stuff that happens every 10-15 years and is healthy for an economy when it comes to lowering interest rates and adjusting for inflation.

135 2018-07-19 22:28:56 Bump stocks and assault rifles. The left's biggest target and the one that will save the fewest lives.
136 2018-07-19 22:28:20 Bump stocks and silencers.  
NO civilian needs those!!
137 2018-07-19 22:27:19 I used to watch $DUST and gold stocks all the time. Not as much anymore.
138 2018-07-19 22:26:02 Better to trade stocks with history of earnings growth than unproven IPOs. Not a bad strategy to invest if there's a strong LT thesis but betting that they will skyrocket in the ST because they've done already isn't likely going to work out. Oh and what about that trade war.
139 2018-07-19 22:24:42 that is such a great percentage amount, I am so happy to have taken a part in commenting to help ban bump stocks on that website!

142 2018-07-19 22:22:54 1%ers do pay a lot in taxes but then so do the rest of us. And, gee, I don’t have any off shore tax havens to help me out. Most corporations profits don’t “trickle down” to employees/consumers. They buy back stocks and dividends go right back in their pockets. Now even richer.

149 2018-07-19 22:17:33 Wondering about the future of #fintech? @jimcramer talks on growth #stocks in the sector (along with #medtech sector) on @MadMoneyOnCNBC - tremendous potential! Looks like fintech is likely to continue rising.
150 2018-07-19 22:17:15 Upon further analysis, @Bell_Potter has decided TechnologyOne $TNE will grow near 15% pa and potentially even higher paced from FY22 onwards. Buy. Target lifts to $5.75 from $5.01 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
151 2018-07-19 22:16:36 Leavenworth for telling an NCO to fuck off? No, kid. This is how I know you were never in the military - You have a child's understanding of it. Do you think we get thrown into the stocks for getting seconds at chow, too?
152 2018-07-19 22:16:28 How about medicare for all?  why don't you work on single payer health care that would cover all americans?  Of course health care in this country is sick care profit driven insurance that only benefits the pockets of the CEOS and those who own stocks in the companies.

154 2018-07-19 22:16:03 $AAPL - "They cant keep growing, they're not innovating"
$AMZN & $NFLX - "The PE is way too high, no way they can keep this up." Famous last words of people who called these stocks cults
155 2018-07-19 22:16:02 Dear followers, now, I just follow the Nikkei. I stop forecasts for the others stocks.
156 2018-07-19 22:15:20 $MSFT continues to impress. @satyanadella positioned the company to be a competitor in the cloud and it's paying off. The future is looking bright for $MSFT. #stocks #StockMarket
157 2018-07-19 22:14:57 Haha! They are positive on TechnologyOne $TNE, which matches my own view, and I note the share price has rallied in a hurry from near $4 to above $5. About time, too! #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

- first: there is no billions of coins of premining, 1% is total. It is equal to 1.84 billion. This used to run Coin for example : 0.6 btc listing fee for stocks paid by premining.
- Cryptonote starter instructions is not enough to build and run coin.
161 2018-07-19 22:12:00 Yup. Most people don’t know how stocks work. 

And if he did sell shares to pay employees he’d be diluted and eventually lose control of his own company.
162 2018-07-19 22:11:47 I've been mentioning that this earnings season will be a bumpy ride ... Note there will be more stocks which make nasty surprises like $NFLX, so this time around EITHER play my pre-earnings with conditional orders, OR better still, focus on #OVI POST-Earnings setups.
163 2018-07-19 22:11:43 Let’s buy stocks together

167 2018-07-19 22:07:52 Man. All these articles come out saying "A correction is coming in weed stocks" or "a correction is coming in China tech". Honestly. $IQ is down about 25% from its highs. $CGC $WEED is down almost 33%. How much of a 'correction' are you expecting here?!?
168 2018-07-19 22:06:56 Wow...capitalism has gone haywire. A company makes huge profits but stocks stay idle, while numerous companies who burn cash soar high in the stock market.
169 2018-07-19 22:06:31 I’m going 3 going back in time and heavily investing in key stocks. I’m also buying the Patriots for the steal Kraft got.

173 2018-07-19 22:04:01 1.- Jeff Bezos don't have 150 billions of us$, that is market value of his stock inmediato Amazon.
2.- i guess, on Amazon people work for a montly o weekly payment, so, no, they don't have any right over amazons stocks.
3.- grow up.

176 2018-07-19 22:02:32 Nice job. Which stocks? Also, how much are your commissions per trade?
177 2018-07-19 22:02:19 I will forever stand by the unpopular opinion that 3 stocks would’ve been so much better for smash 4.
178 2018-07-19 22:01:58 Umm have you seen the numbers? Our economy is on fire! Wages up, stocks up, taxes down
179 2018-07-19 22:01:47 #GetRidofNathan Nathan never talks about any stocks or options without bashing Trump. This would make him a FAKE Jew. I’m a REAL one:). Nathan subverts any Judaism he may have (Could easily be secular Atheist:) to his REAL “religion”...Uber Radical Libt@rdism!
180 2018-07-19 21:59:38 ...in cash, stocks, bonds...or just a promissory note?
181 2018-07-19 21:58:56 Stocks up
182 2018-07-19 21:55:30 I deadass had a kid teach me the ways of investing into stocks. Shit was crazy.
183 2018-07-19 21:55:10 Do you do donations to school library stocks?
184 2018-07-19 21:54:36 Knew nothing about economy before Crash, but read & learned. Trump seems to have learned everything he thinks he knows from daddy Fred & has learned nothing since; stuck in a time warp. Rate hike helps his voters w/CDs, too poor to invest in stocks.
185 2018-07-19 21:54:26 The primary tech stocks driving the NASDAQ index’s returns are Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google, commonly known by the acronym, “FAANG.” Out of the entire index, these heavily-weighted large cap stocks typically rank within the top 10 and frequently have influence on

187 2018-07-19 21:52:17 The ANNUAL return difference between:

*US stocks (S&P 500) and 5-YR T-Notes since 1926 is 5.1%

*US stock asset classes since 1927 is 5.3%

*Int’l stock asset classes since 1975 is 6.4%

Asset allocation decisions have a much bigger long-term effect than  small fee differences

191 2018-07-19 21:47:25 Novichok?
192 2018-07-19 21:45:32 You just ignored everything I said. It's a bad idea because you're buffing a character that doesn't need one. There's no need to change stocks or percentages. This still makes Cloud an unfair character. Stocks are the same so it's a fair fight. Can you not be stupid?
193 2018-07-19 21:44:41 Shoutout to 80s guy on this train in full Miami Vice suit and new wave hair, on his phone talking about stocks and trades the whole trip so far.
194 2018-07-19 21:44:29 Argh you’re kidding?! My youth is flashing before my very eyes, trying to clean up the squits in the middle of an earthquake 
195 2018-07-19 21:43:21 So ur only argument to this is that people will complain about it? They can make it so the adjusted stocks/percentage can be auto inputted so you don't have to adjust the numbers every time. Also what did I ignore?
196 2018-07-19 21:42:37 I agree at this point in time with stocks way overvalued at #ATH and Schiller P/E only higher/riskier once since the great depression. Once stocks crash they will be a good buy and less risky, for now bitcoin and gold are the buys for normal people.

198 2018-07-19 21:41:35 Investing in crypto is like investing in start-up. Trading crypto is like trading penny stocks.

207 2018-07-19 21:35:40 My point is that your idea doesn't help at all. It's still going to be the same but soon or later someones going to complain about it, this is why all stocks and percentages should all be at default to be fair. Also you just ignored your whole idea being bad, which is what I said

222 2018-07-19 21:25:21 The big hair boom of the late 80’s/early 90’s caused hair spray stocks to necessarily skyrocket.
223 2018-07-19 21:23:48 Based on $msft and $ibm earnings. I would think $nvda $fb $aapl are going to also beat and stocks should go up.
224 2018-07-19 21:23:31 Two interesting economic expectations possibilities with regard to trumps fed sound bite

265 2018-07-19 21:05:00 VORP kind of considers the player’s value in isolation. If you can manage to determine the right “replacement player”. I believe a better way is to treat your team as a portfolio of stocks.. & try to optimize your investments based on return & risk within the budget & constraints

315 2018-07-19 20:39:37 Hey @kurteichenwald! US equities have vastly outperformed foreign markets this year. You talked a lot when the inverse was happening and said it was evidence that Trump actually had a negative effect on the economy, stocks, etc. Thoughts?
316 2018-07-19 20:39:25 Exactly - he's proud of the prospect of walking off, not paying his bills.  Like a sleazy conmen.  How did the people of Wokingham vote in this liar.

I'd like a session of 'truth or tomatoes' - put him in the stocks, and let him talk. Everytime he lies he gets pelted with toms.

a very good question.
324 2018-07-19 20:35:48 I know what the loophole is, It's all about how the LP's are misrepresenting their listings as a medical product, with no mention of 'Cannabis" this is how US Financial Holding companies are able to Trade, exchange, and claim their stocks I have even contacted the SEC about this
325 2018-07-19 20:35:45 Of course I'M not paying for it. About $5.4M in stocks and the rest will be paid for by the idiot ratepayers...I mean really smart voters.
326 2018-07-19 20:35:30 Yeah my stocks are really showing it.  (not really)
327 2018-07-19 20:34:59 Of course they did. Many supported Trump specifically for #SCOTUS and dems tend to vote against #2A rights. It's silly to think they wouldn't. I think they are represented fairly well. Most members didn't like the capitulation on bump stocks
328 2018-07-19 20:34:56 And stocks....
329 2018-07-19 20:33:32 I don’t know why anyone is surprised by this. She’s always been like this. She can hardly admit “fuck knows, we have no idea about any of it, we’re just doing this to make a killing on stocks and investments we couldn’t possibly make otherwise”, can she.

388 2018-07-19 20:02:35 Lost in the magic of fancy tech stocks is the fact that $ATH.TO reports on Tuesday. They had a pretty mediocre Q1, and it's trading at around the same level as when they reported then. Numbers will presumably be much better (highly leveraged to WTI).

520 2018-07-19 18:48:18 think it's odd that we are still referring to today's economy as an "economic recovery." the recessecion was a decade ago, stocks are at new highs, home values are at new highs. we are past recovered. that the "recovery" gains  went to the very wealthy is a whole nother matter
521 2018-07-19 18:47:07 #Mortgage Bonds modestly higher. #Stocks lower. 10-yr yield edges lower to 2.84%.

641 2018-07-19 17:42:51 Listen to any mutual fund show where new recent investors ask questions & look their portfolio they mainly hold the mid & small cap funds (not one but all folio filled with small midcap). No wonder mid & small cap performed in last 2 yrs.. Same stocks being churned to move higher
642 2018-07-19 17:42:48 It's based on the proctor & gamble economic conspiracy theory imho. Proctor started loosing their stocks because people wouldn't buy soap & toothpaste, and that in large part was because they were loosing enormous amounts of self confidence and self respect from the world crisis.

644 2018-07-19 17:41:44 One could argue Folty and Nick’s stocks are as high as they have ever been. I love the guys, espically nick, but for the right price I’d part ways. I just can’t bring myself to understand why we’d give up kolby allard or Ian Anderson for a rental. Appreciate your feedback :)
645 2018-07-19 17:41:25 Not entirely true, but we know you are trying to make this state a Democratic one---In your issues you want to ban bump stocks. Our Republican President has already done this. There has always been universal background checks
646 2018-07-19 17:41:11 Mike, on the decile graph, does this place stocks by decile where they started the year, or where they are now?  Might make a difference, especially for the top and bottom decile.
647 2018-07-19 17:41:05 So I calculate the number of equivalent "stocks" in the S&P 500 to be about 120 at the moment, taking the reciprocal of the Herf of the current percentage weights. Don't know how that compares to the distribution historically.

649 2018-07-19 17:38:36 Why do you put ittle dew so low? I think her combo game and her ability to end stocks off of a stray hit should help her up to top 3. I think she is 2nd right now.
650 2018-07-19 17:35:24 I my opinion we need to consider the idea that this isn’t our year. Teams give up prospects to win out and the goal is WS that same year. We should think about what was expected before the year began and enjoy all that we’ve accomplished. We should look to sell guys with stocks

657 2018-07-19 17:31:56 Just thinking that the Gini is hard to interpret, while the reciprocal of the Herf has a direct meaning. For example, if the reciprocal of the Herf is 25 for the market cap distribution of the S&P 500 we can say that the concentration in the S&P 500 is equivalent to ~25 stocks.

764 2018-07-19 16:41:11 Stocks are trading in negative territory, as they currently sit in an "over-bought" position.  MBS is currently up 11bps, as it started on the 25 DMA and is testing the 100 DMA ceiling.  Yields have dropped down to 2.85%.
765 2018-07-19 16:41:00 Spot prices are up, yet futures from October  on are down significantly. This indicates that longer term oil is going sideways and it is bearish for stocks.
766 2018-07-19 16:40:47 Yes I remember it well. 
767 2018-07-19 16:40:21 In my almost 2 decades of tracking/analysis mkts, have not seen such a large and long disconnect between the larger cap and smaller cap stocks. Its a new beast to deal with and we will need some new age tools to dissect it.
768 2018-07-19 16:39:14 -ATH & 52wk high stocks will most likely go higher.
-stocks climb cliff on way up & take elevator on way down.
-profit is only when you sell.
769 2018-07-19 16:38:56 Stocks lower on trade tariff issues, disappointing earnings. Mortgage Bonds flat.
770 2018-07-19 16:38:40 Bump stocks for ar 10s. Third with the wealth of paddock he could afford a Vietnam era m60 machine gun shooting 308. Had he done that...
771 2018-07-19 16:38:36 Stocks open lower with modest losses. Dow -55 points.

774 2018-07-19 16:37:37 This means nothing if the jobs don’t pay living wage. The tax scam didn’t help, raises are not being given. Companies are using the money to buy back stocks. You lie to us daily we will remember in 2020
775 2018-07-19 16:37:21 You reckon these mid and small caps will not correct further if these 15-20 stocks begin to fall?
776 2018-07-19 16:37:12 When the stocks are failing , why don't they ask the companies , what is the reason for fall
777 2018-07-19 16:37:00 Thanks to #AmIDiversified and @JimCramer for weekly reminding me of the importance of portfolio diversification.  Today $PEP $HD and $AAPL are bolstering the 8 stocks in my portfolio that are down.
778 2018-07-19 16:36:22 Stocks run, then retrace to the 10ema, which in this case is the gap, then they do the REAL run! Basic trading here! GL

781 2018-07-19 16:35:29 I've read the article twice and don't understand what they are doing. Are they buying the stocks that get removed from $SPLV because they were removed after quarterly rebalance? Or buying stocks in financials and industrial sector #ETF that have seen outflows.
782 2018-07-19 16:35:22 I know it was concrete lol. And most of it went to Skegness especially the safety barriers that are still used today after 21 years
783 2018-07-19 16:34:28 Basically it points (a) worsening fundamentals/growing debt at majority companies, eventually leading to banking crisis (b) worsening job situation as most companies cutting jobs, few like AMZN creating small now (c) all funds owning same few stocks and buying them every day

789 2018-07-19 16:30:58 Inflation is up, wages have fallen & corporations did not hire more with their tax breaks, they bought more stocks
790 2018-07-19 16:30:43 Market II: Despite small declines for most key indexes, here is one positive divergence: winners beating losers handily on both #nasdaq (roughly 4-3 margin) and #nyse (3 #stocks up for every 2 down).

796 2018-07-19 16:28:34 This is why I’m usually bearish on pot stocks right now. The government will ruin the sales potential by slapping insane taxes on it. If the near future is so bright and profitable for pot companies then why do they keep doing PP’s left right and centre?

798 2018-07-19 16:28:25 This stock will rebound. It's one of those protected stocks backed by communist propagandist to warp people's minds and turn them into soulless degenerates.

801 2018-07-19 16:26:37 I disagree.  They understand the stocks part.  Isn't that where they stick your head into one hole and your hands into two other holes?  Like in a guillotine?
802 2018-07-19 16:26:37 An investment app. You can set it up however you’d like but typically it takes your excess change (it rounds up purchases you’ve made on your card) and invests it into stocks. I just have mine taking out a set amount each week. I haven’t earned much but I +
803 2018-07-19 16:26:03 Market ran up into this announcement.   Sold the easy news.  Still a yr away from 232.  Now the stocks will sell off.    Watch which one s hold up better

808 2018-07-19 16:22:28 I asked for the receipt where they said that they don't want to invest in stocks, I didn't ask anything about Yoongi or if they could do whatever they want.

811 2018-07-19 16:20:56 Charles, Tariffs help the economy (especially stocks) the short term. In the long term they help also assuming they negotiate better trade deals. They have the opposite effect of the Reagan tax cuts. Tariffs create urgency to make purchases before they go into effect.
812 2018-07-19 16:20:35 Industrial stocks popping on solid Q2 and higher guidance. Its the only S&P 500 sector where every company has beat EPS and Sales est, thus far (I know it's early). And no, the #s weren't slashed going into the reporting period. #trade $XLI $SPY
813 2018-07-19 16:20:24 Whose wages?  CEOs?  They're implementing hundreds of billions of dollars in stock buybacks, about $5 billion a DAY, and CEOs are cashing in their stocks nearly $10 billion a month.

815 2018-07-19 16:19:48 Lots of good stocks yet to correct , once they do ,the ones already correcting/cted might stop !
816 2018-07-19 16:19:47 @SunriseTrader See to many posting stocks that are already up significantly just to look good. You're one of the few that actually post with the opportunity for an entry on a stock with reasonable downside risk, along with good upside potential.  Appreciated!
817 2018-07-19 16:19:21 That’s also using the singular case of Apple, one of the best performing stocks ever.

819 2018-07-19 16:18:32 This is to prevent the mistake made in the power sector, where people got those licences without having the financial muscle. I won't be surprised if it's through stocks and it gets over subscribed soon. Dangote did the same just of recent. No need to put pressure on our Naira
820 2018-07-19 16:18:16 @HouseGOP That is a lie!  Here are the facts: Worker wages drop while companies spend billions to boost stocks!
821 2018-07-19 16:16:58 $PDCO  sweeping on top of the rumor ....     $DHR spin off   has dental stocks popping
822 2018-07-19 16:16:56 Uh, pension/retirement funds buy stocks. I'd wager nearly all of them own AMZN.
823 2018-07-19 16:15:22 Stocks: Over longer periods, the line that resembles a ride on a roller coaster morphs into a gently rising upward slope.
824 2018-07-19 16:15:18 Well unless 100,000s of successful day traders are just lucky across all markets, forex ,commodity, stocks, bonds, etc.then I I'd go with option A.
It's been repeated countless times, 90% of day traders fail.

827 2018-07-19 16:14:43 If u r invested in any mid-cap or small-cap india financial stocks....its time to sell.....that market is gonna be hit hard by the current inflation rate, and huge income tax and when the government can't pay the bills anymore..there'll be chaos in this market..time to buy gold!
828 2018-07-19 16:14:38 can you share the link/video/whatever where they said that they don't want to invest in stocks? this would help clarify many things instead of acting like haters
829 2018-07-19 16:14:29 Weiss is a NEVER Trumper so it doesnt matter what happens he will find something wrong with it. He has his stocks BUT IF you bring into it Trump then everything sucks.

832 2018-07-19 16:13:08 @HalftimeReport Mkc, Fizz, tgt, numerous retail stocks....it’s not just tech and FANG.
833 2018-07-19 16:12:45 well that was a cause of the melt down in 07 when so many lost stocks and bonds from bank and financial closings-we are finally in a recovery that is real not those QE1&2 that only did benefit the uberrich (under Yellan) give it time to take effect
834 2018-07-19 16:12:40 But are the wages rising?  Are corporate profits rising?  Are CEOs selling their stocks now before they tank?
835 2018-07-19 16:12:30 TV pundits claim the market would be down if it weren’t for the FANG stocks..... incorrect. They must be justifying their poor stock picking. Plenty stocks going up in most sectors. $$

839 2018-07-19 16:09:37 Its always perplexed me to see the valuations of the FANG stocks compared to their P/E ratio and the overwhelming % they take up in the value of the NASDAQ. I do like what they have been doing on the Real Estate front with Google buying Chelsea Market in NYC.
840 2018-07-19 16:08:40 Long Eaton had them kinda fences but most had missing concrete blocks so you could easily walk through from the bank in to the pits.@johnbayliss5353 I agree it’s brafield pits
841 2018-07-19 16:08:39 Only 10 stocks are driving the market.Investing in over valued & expensive stocks tantamounts to lazy investing in the hope that  only expensive stocks are highly growth oriented and most safe to invest.
842 2018-07-19 16:08:33 Worker wages drop,companies spend billions on stocks.
Washing machines, large appliances cost 20% more. Cars are planned to go up $4000-$7000.
And farmers are losing money on their crops.

844 2018-07-19 16:07:34 My wages went up! Gas prices go up & down.  Health care reform was F'd over by Traitor McCain.  My Company is hiring rapidly instead of furloughing 100's.

846 2018-07-19 16:07:15 Hmm. Ask yourself, buying back stocks from where? I’ll give you a hint. Were you ok with a lot of our T-bills owned foreign? Were you ok when we began to buy back our T-bills?
847 2018-07-19 16:07:05 My patience has grown a lot in recent years but only for short plays lol! If anything ive lost some patience when going long but will incorporate more of it in my game over time. I'm effective going long, but WAY MORE EFFECTIVE shorting bs stocks masquerading good companies..

850 2018-07-19 16:06:11 Now some of the Largecaps are very very expensive due exuberant buying as all are chasing these 20 Index Stocks, whereas Midcaps / Smallcaps are languishing and are available at quite attractive valuations

868 2018-07-19 15:59:34 For it to work, one would have to purchase ENOUGH stock for the interest to make up the expense of the product. For example, I bought 5 stocks of Apple years ago and have made $337.86 total gain. That's not enough to cover the iphones I've purchased since then.

907 2018-07-19 15:41:26 The real question is, since most of us young investors have not experienced a bear market yet, will you have the mental strength when the time comes to take money from your emergency fund into more stocks?
908 2018-07-19 15:41:25 One thing I have noticed with trading stocks. Certain stocks react better to certain technicals. For example; some stocks are unchanged regardless of the VWAP.  Find the technicals that consistently effect certain stocks and master them. 
909 2018-07-19 15:41:17 But I try to only get into stocks I'll hold over well over a year, because that way you only pay capital gains tax instead of full bracket tax. So these are all long plays for me.

1015 2018-07-19 15:02:23 @dbongino very interesting fact of how Netflix has lost stocks due to subscribers since Susan Rice and Obama were hired onto Netflix

1017 2018-07-19 14:59:13 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks

1025 2018-07-19 14:55:20 If we are being #honest with ourselves, that's the #commondenominator. Every champ in the WNBA seems to have Top 10 talent in their Starting Lineups.

1026 2018-07-19 14:55:09 It's my sincere belief that stock markets will never be regulated. Not because they can't be, but because anyone in a position to do so will immediately be targeted by corporate interests, and the action plan will be "make them rich by giving them stocks."
1027 2018-07-19 14:55:02 Such a beautiful chart! MAny retail stocks had a similar chart setup to that $M this week and many of them played out nicely!!...

That's why they are #legit contenders for the title right now.  Tina Charles is Top 10.  She would make @Sloot22, @alliequigley & tm better.

1033 2018-07-19 14:50:35 It is already ending badly for many. If one does not own inflated stock or real estate assets they are already being hurt.

Nor is it failure if the MF sells your stocks mindlessly.

You need to play the game to suit yourself. Others don't quite matter if you play it fair and right.

1266 2018-07-19 13:18:11 What is good is going to be the best ! Coz they have survived the worst phase of markets ! So I feel 15-20 stocks will grown to 40-45 stocks and that will take market ahead !
1267 2018-07-19 13:18:01 @WillFussey Hear your graduation was today - congrats! How did you do, and what’s the plan next?

1272 2018-07-19 13:16:25 Going to talk about using Russian money to help Donnie (aka Putin’s bitch) win the election?  Or maybe, talk about arming kindergarteners to keep everyone safe?  How awesome bump stocks are?
1273 2018-07-19 13:16:24 Today is THE PERFECT day to look for "relative strength" plays 

Look for stocks that are flat or green at the open..... or better yet, stocks that open red but quickly go green.
1274 2018-07-19 13:15:48 I personally do a mix of both index funds and individual stocks. I'd prefer to have more Microsoft in my portfolio than Netflix, while still having the diversity of index funds included
1275 2018-07-19 13:15:37 Problem is there is no bottom the way small and midcap stocks were beaten down .

1278 2018-07-19 13:15:24 20% of the stocks would create 80% of the wealth. And 80% of the wealth would be created in 20% of the time. So have a focused portfolio and be prepared for lumpy returns.

1280 2018-07-19 13:14:57 I went to Triage via A&E a couple of weeks ago and came out the other side with 2 crutches a leg brace and 3 breaks in my Fibula. So you are very wise getting stocks together

1285 2018-07-19 13:12:18 Nice idea man. Did you use the same 5 stocks going back thru history tho? I’d think the top 5 priced Dow stocks changes quite frequently - do you adjust the Fab 5 index when they do?
1286 2018-07-19 13:12:03 The article states most people should not buy individual stocks, and he is stating why he personally chooses not to. I'd recommend commenting on the post so he can respond to you, allowing a healthy convo.
1287 2018-07-19 13:10:47 If I could go back in time, I'd invent a time machine so I could buy Amazon and Apple IPO stocks.

1305 2018-07-19 13:00:15 Investors were very scared during the second quarter and Low Quality stocks (up 14.5%) led the performance derby.  It’s why low quality does so well over the long-term.  Ever-present wall of worry.
1306 2018-07-19 13:00:04 Forex or penny stocks?
1307 2018-07-19 12:59:26 Aside from being personal opinion l, it overlooks that indexes are self-cleansing.  If you invest in single stock in the wrong industry you’re screwed, but invest in an index, sure you’ll take a short term hit, but long term, stocks are replaced by the new next best thing
1308 2018-07-19 12:59:06 Wow. Very interesting. Thanks
I assume for stocks an astro-investor would look at dates of incorporation of a Co? Or date of IPO or RTO? prob all wud have meaning and should fit in with original chart anyway?
Just for interest; find it fascinating.  Cheers

1367 2018-07-19 12:15:16 All those money invested in Graphite stocks.
1368 2018-07-19 12:15:00 Quantitative easing has been going on in stock market since Dodd Frank was passed July 2010. How much money is the fed feeding wall street per month with our tax dollars? Fed was pumping 85 billion a month starting 2010. This has been artificially inflating stocks and 401K’s.
1369 2018-07-19 12:14:47 He also sees over valued stocks as well,  and an opportunity to strengthen his valuable stock as well !!  As usual the greedy investors on Wall Street want some of that money in their pockets !!
1370 2018-07-19 12:13:49 We notified Russia because Russian soldiers man the air defense facilities. They were given time to get out because we were not attacking Russia, we were bombing Syria. 1 hour notice.

1372 2018-07-19 12:12:57 Less income for the Nation for infrastructure and proving for the General Welfare of the Nation. Stock buybacks for the corporations. Increased dividends for their shareholders (just 54% of Americans own stocks). Off the top of my head. Why do you ask?
1373 2018-07-19 12:12:44 ;-) so it did start with a B.
1374 2018-07-19 12:11:42 Mid & small-cap carnage seems overdone.  Paranoia will vanish soon. Money hiding behind top 15-20 stocks will soon start looking for rational valuations.

1414 2018-07-19 11:51:04 Of course. The tariffs won't do anything but spook people really. Any levy's will just be balancers in the unfair trade that's been going on for ages. If done right it can be a big bonus for stocks.

1426 2018-07-19 11:38:42 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

1442 2018-07-19 11:28:36 Most of the "quality" stocks are now over owned and substantially expensive.

1449 2018-07-19 11:19:26 I do not agree here. There are still slowly changing physical stocks at the core of all our economies.

Eventually prices will probably normalize.

1759 2018-07-19 06:02:44 When everything is down, instead of buying what your friends are adding - you should trust your “in-house” research and add to your core conviction quality stocks.

Remember you know more about what you already own instead of borrowed conviction.

Luck has to be your side!

1874 2018-07-19 04:44:35 Sir, the fact remains that we are in a bear market with no bottom when it comes to broader market. You have been putting a very brave face since last 7 months. But everyday the small and mid cap stocks collapse like no tomorrow. 3-5% downfall each day is normal for them. VERY SAD

1913 2018-07-19 04:13:21 Stocks go up when they can’t go down & vice versa.  This simple notion explains most of all stock price movement apart from some Alpha.

1995 2018-07-19 03:02:00 Someone tell my H.S. Economics teacher that $WWE stock topped $80/share today. I’ll be busy telling 2017 Me that they were stupid for unloading all of their shares, randomly, to spend a few hours day-trading dirty pharmaceutical stocks.
1996 2018-07-19 03:01:12 Done in the morning. We aren’t looking at a ton of garbage stocks.  Core few that members hammer welllllllllll in advance  
1997 2018-07-19 03:00:52 Can we pay you to proclaim the same about other stocks we hold?  Every time I have bought more $APT the price has immediately fallen 10%  such is the life of an investor!
1998 2018-07-19 03:00:46 My stocks are way up. But you know what? They are over valued. No way the stocks I put in a Roth in the early 90s are worth 10 times as much now. And since I'm not retired, I'm paying those inflated prices for stuff I know will take by the time I do retire.

2004 2018-07-19 02:59:09 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

2005 2018-07-19 02:57:51 Wilbur Ross had short sells and puts on stocks he owned recently.... do you suspect he has short sells and puts on the overall market and is encouraging Trump to continue his Trade War to make millions on those market bets????!

2013 2018-07-19 02:45:32 That's why I'm suggesting Cloud players compete with fewer stocks and/or have some percent damage already taken to make it fair. I don't like how Cloud was ruined for the sake of 'balance'. Playing with the shorten/nerfed Buster Sword makes me feel dead inside.

Just stay invested. Midcaps gain fast as they lose. Patience is the key
2073 2018-07-19 02:21:18 So yes, that goes back to the bond market, if you did that, somebody somewhere is missing out on a management fee.

2077 2018-07-19 02:15:27 Copy paste:   I sincerely believe that the so called "quality basket" is treading in the bubble territory and is avoidable for any fresh investment. I am rather inclined to take out some money from this and put in the stocks that have become quality due to undue price correction.
2078 2018-07-19 02:14:23 An analysis of current portfolios of top 25 mutual fund schemes shows that their portfolios are highly concentrated in a handful of stocks, irrespective of the original mandate of the fund or expectations of the investors.
2079 2018-07-19 02:14:13 Sure, they watch share prices in gold stocks, but would never downgrade bubble tech stocks like AMZN using the same logic

2104 2018-07-19 01:58:52 Look for stocks that move.  Do your homework. Know how a stock normally moves during each earnings season and what normally happens when it meets, misses and beat earnings estimates.

2108 2018-07-19 01:54:53 I understand how stocks work.  I'm saying if Bezos couldn't liquidate his stocks if he wanted to he wouldn't hold on to them.  He's been quoted in saying that the only thing he can think of to spend his money on is space exploration.
2109 2018-07-19 01:53:56 @Buffett15 stocks have that happen daily will not disagree with that but think of yahoo how long that sit at that area from the 1990's
2110 2018-07-19 01:53:23 Especially when these stocks are incredibly liquid for all intents and purposes. All these CEOs need to do is fill out a form for the SEC and their buy and sell orders will execute just as fast as anyone elses (instantly). See Buffet, Gates, etc giving their stock to charity.
2111 2018-07-19 01:53:23 Canes name one president who has done anything like this? 
Name one President that hasn't divisted from business and stocks they own, and put them in a Trust. 
Name one President that owned a golf course or hotel and then charged the American taxpayers to stay there.

2113 2018-07-19 01:52:30 And you still aren't correct. Canada bought the uranium stocks (this isn't actual physical uranium numbnuts, it's rights only) and then sold them to Russia as is our right as a sovereign nation.

2119 2018-07-19 01:50:15 For him it s all about $. Who give a crap about freedom and democracy if money is flowing around. I just need to wear the same t shirt and get 1 dollar salary to show the rest of the world I dont care about money, i own the stocks anyways and i called fb users “stupid fks”
2120 2018-07-19 01:49:37 If stocks weren't a relatively safe way to hold value no one would buy them.
2121 2018-07-19 01:48:08 The value of money fluctuates.  Stocks are just another form of currency.  Its extremely fair to use wealth tied in stocks to calculate net worth.
2122 2018-07-19 01:47:35 will you get the divident if you pledge the stocks ?

2125 2018-07-19 01:46:12 Historically stocks have returned 7% annually after inflation. Tough to say what the future holds, but I used 7% as the assumption to generate this chart
2126 2018-07-19 01:46:07 lol look at penguinz0 video on it, I was legit thinking the exact same thing when he criticized the use of stocks. I think he was expecting like a render or something?
2127 2018-07-19 01:46:01 He should give his stocks to his workers
2128 2018-07-19 01:45:01 Contrary to what Wall Street thinks, Warren Buffett's decision to buy his own stock is not bullish. It means everything he sees is overpriced. 

What happens to overpriced stocks/

2136 2018-07-19 01:34:39 Flint's water isn't his responsibility and world hunger isn't an issue you just throw a couple billion at and it's over. Besides most of his money comes from stocks whose value changes all the time it's not like he's sitting on a stack of cash.
2137 2018-07-19 01:34:14 Oh shit. This is such a chart crime that for a moment I thought top 5 stocks were 50% of the S&P 500. I was so vexed. "How the hell can that be?" 

You need to do 3-5 years time without Excel, Batnick.
2138 2018-07-19 01:31:28 LOL. You’re one of those. Dow is really meaningless as a barometer. Traders like myself go off the S&P. Dow- 30 stocks! I’m sure you weren’t aware of that. If the DOW was at $22,000 on a gradual move instead of exploding, ppl would still be in awe. 7 TRILLION in wealth created
2139 2018-07-19 01:31:13 The problem is he doesn't have that much money. His money is in stocks. If he sells his stocks then he doesn't own the company. He Probally has maybe $2B in cash and assets.

2199 2018-07-19 00:39:06 The world is not as simple as “just give away all your money”. A lot of these billionaires worth is in stocks and bonds. You can’t just “cash out” everything and give it away. Idk why you’re criticizing someone giving away billions of dollars anyways.
2200 2018-07-19 00:37:32 The biggest issue for social media stocks are fake, active accounts. If i had a large position in a social stock id create a bot farm that actively kept accounts alive to fudge AUC on earnings. Huge risk that is never trully priced in.
2201 2018-07-19 00:36:54 Agree, it is not an endorsement to invest in foreign stocks, but rather a commentary regarding those who kept saying "foreign markets are getting hit hard; the U.S. markets are next."

Most of the investing public today is completely blind to how risky longer-term bonds are. They’ve been far riskier than stocks for retirees.
