Not a whim .. but a plan.He's considered the most powerful VP in US history.He was teaching Bush Jr. the ropes, but he held the ropes. He wanted that damn oil in Iraq,etc.

44 2018-03-19 23:56:14 It's the same thing with neoliberal politicians, they all act like this is some kind of sci-fi dream that will never happen, when in reality the current trajectory of society where we keep using *any* oil (not just less) but nothing bad happens is the insane dream.
45 2018-03-19 23:56:14 a lot of ppl were recommending cbd oil for my knee pain bc nothing else was helping, time to give it a try i guess
46 2018-03-19 23:56:10 Fuck the lotion he needs some coconut oil in his life 
47 2018-03-19 23:56:08 Huh y
48 2018-03-19 23:55:52 That's wrong. Malvinas belongs to Argentina since colonial times. There was an argentine governor and population when it was invaded by force and against international law by british force. UK and NATO want the islands for fishing, oil, Antartic projection and strategic position
49 2018-03-19 23:55:13 It was almost easier to find premium hash than premium bud in the 80's.
Especially in maritime Canada, hash and oil were more common than primo bud. Now mexican brick, was everywhere.
50 2018-03-19 23:55:00 It depends on what it is meant by "China". Politburo trades crude oil for itself for example, not for the Chinese nation. They have hired Russian traders
51 2018-03-19 23:55:00 Our guess? Oil and natural gas production has a positive impact on the world economy.
52 2018-03-19 23:54:57 I almost just coated my spaghetti squash rings with balsamic vinegar instead of olive oil, so WOAH maybe I should think about cooking more and RPGs less.
53 2018-03-19 23:54:53 For one, you can use that steel to make pipelines so we can get market value for our oil and use increased taxes to fund needed services.

60 2018-03-19 23:53:54 I dunno, I feel like some people are a lot more able to spot snake oil salesmen like Peterson because those who behave with integrity have a knack for spotting people in the habit of behaving without it.
61 2018-03-19 23:53:54 Lies are like oil on the hands almost impossible to grasp anything.  Dump Trump & Save America!
62 2018-03-19 23:53:34 Notice that the propaganda poster you attached deals with U.S. pipelines but the “tar sands campaign” only targets Canadian pipelines because the purpose of the campaign is to land lock Canadian oil.
63 2018-03-19 23:53:32 @carlyraejepsen Everyone knows Steve’s father is Syrian ? Where Jesus going to land? In theory . 
And plus I need oil. I am going to invade Iraq and took the oil. Lots of oil we need to inject to the system .

66 2018-03-19 23:53:17  supposedly if you put it on your lures it's supposed to attract the walleye more due to it having shark liver oil as an ingredient.  I thought he was toying with me but if you Google it alot of the walleye guys talk about it lol. I still don't have faith in that crap tho

72 2018-03-19 23:52:59 As far as the us is concerned, the money we would save from not importing oil would eliminate the trade deficit and make the entire thing *net profitable* 10 after completion. 

(I.e. we actually save more money on oil imports then we spend on installing solar panels)
73 2018-03-19 23:52:43 He robbed a few billion and now the state can pay people to sit around for a while and hope the price of oil goes up
74 2018-03-19 23:52:24 Following the money isn't stopping Saudi's ability to take oil to ten dollars a barrel the bottom line to USA being oil independent and Russia even having a country also so Russian oligarchs can steal oil money laundered in trump properties

76 2018-03-19 23:52:20 What about oil, I don’t know anything about Azerbaijan but I always default to how much Putin is dependent on oil for revenue and he can’t be happy with our increased production or 60bbl.

81 2018-03-19 23:51:24 Venezuela nationalized the oil industry and kicked out those capitalists who knew what they were doing. Production slowed to the point of non-existence. Seems a problem with socialism.

86 2018-03-19 23:50:57 Just measuring the resource inputs doesn't really capture it.

It's also like there's this cult of oil. As if people are incapable of imagining the world without it,l. You can just sit down and do the math on transition to 95% wind/solar in 10 years, it's not hard.

Boys...not men...untrained boys were given oil wealth to spend without oversight. They not only blew away the oil fortune, they started to borrow ...
92 2018-03-19 23:49:53 Yes, & so is oil (largely).  So if China wants to lower oil px's w/the CNY contract (as you have asserted, & which with I agree), while US shale needs ~$55-60 to keep growing production, what will happen to CNY/USD if oil falls in CNY but stays here in USD?  CNY will have to rise
93 2018-03-19 23:49:42 Yep. Thomas Sowell distrusts experts because human expertise is severely limited--but the Trumpanzees turn that on its head.  They exalt the wisdom of Deliverance Hillbillies and snake oil salesmen.

96 2018-03-19 23:49:26 Highly agree for many reasons, 2 of my friends have MS and thanks to medical marijuana do not suffer, as well as my cousin's daughter who is prone to seizures takes an oil derived from marijuana with it's THC content removed, now she has drastically fewer seizures.
97 2018-03-19 23:49:23 Just as easy (and more accurate) to say “A state dependent on tankers and Alberta oil wants to stop being dependent on tankers and Alberta oil.” That’s not hypocrisy, that’s progress.

104 2018-03-19 23:48:16 My theory is that most of their technology is less hewn from stone than created like coral by their advanced biological engineering.  Possibly this is an attempt to recreate mid 20th century western culture after the Death of Oil?

136 2018-03-19 23:44:50 Your best bet is to use great skin care and. Mattifying primer. Use oil free foundations. I use Lancôme, Smashbox, Black Opal, Maybelline and L'Oréal foundations that promise a matte finish. I set my fave with a MAC or Maybelline Matte and Poreless powders.

141 2018-03-19 23:44:19 More seriously...Oil money was the balm for the correct economic fears of the 'less persuaded'

You won't change your mind..but others are..hence the softening of support.

You can't see, or accept this; I get that.  I'm not even trying to persuade you.
142 2018-03-19 23:44:18 I don’t mean the MSM.Trump supporters are brainwashed because of their blind faith&belief in Trump despite his words&actions.Any criticism of Trump is instantly met w/dismissal&accusations despite proof to the contrary.They are mindless sheep following a snake oil salesmen.
143 2018-03-19 23:44:18 And you only use olive oil, never butter, right?
Re: Jack Pepin dammit! and sour cream doesnt belong on fruit Jack for ****s sake
144 2018-03-19 23:44:07 In BC we do not want a new pipeline to export raw bitumen. If you read the article carefully, you will see that Washington state takes only Alaska North Slope oil (ANSO)—not raw bitumen. What they get via transmountain is upgraded in Alberta to an ANSO blend. #bcpoli #wapoli

150 2018-03-19 23:43:12 Seeing how Wells Fargo was one of the banks responsible for forcing Native Americans off their land for the oil pipeline in North Dakota. I am pretty sure he might actually get promoted and a raise.

154 2018-03-19 23:42:28 The US hasn’t exactly been helpful in the ME. Unfortunately, 55% of our oil comes from them.

160 2018-03-19 23:41:50 That would be really nice to do, before it's forced on us, but it will require much better questions than we are currently asking if we are going to pull it off.

165 2018-03-19 23:41:38 Unfortunate? It's a disgrace. These guys put their bodies, heart and mind on the line whenever they step out there to fight. Apparently it's wrong to have some CBD oil or a cheeky spliff to numb the pain from pre/post fight? It gives no advantage to a fighter at all  #

170 2018-03-19 23:41:16 Your side started it !

In the book of things no union side person ever said:"It's our oil"

You'll be accusing me of basing my historical views on little more than a film made by an Australian next... .
171 2018-03-19 23:41:08 昨日、命の母デビューして思ったんですけど、なんでチョコラBBみたいに１錠ずつしか出さないぞ的な穴にしなかったんでしょうかね？がばーっと出して数えてがばーっと容器に戻すのもストレスな更年期です。おはようございます。
172 2018-03-19 23:41:08 It’s just one pipeline- there’s a real limit to how much production it can handle. And there’s a very real limit to its economic benefits. It will create a few short term construction jobs. It will not suddenly put Alberta oil on an equal footing with Texas crude.
173 2018-03-19 23:40:59 So my sister gets really bad eczema and tried coconut oil after I suggested it, not knowing how good it really was but omg her skin is so soft now, I’m amazed
174 2018-03-19 23:40:53 Goooood luck with the $300 oil changes.

179 2018-03-19 23:40:00 It was definitely rigged to a degree. We might find out in about 50 yrs by how much. When our oil & Gas have gone & they left us a desert.
180 2018-03-19 23:39:50 You have to mention Hebrew Biafra from SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE by British govt to steal oil. It is still ongoing.
181 2018-03-19 23:39:43 All of the refineries in Washington state that process Alaskan oil that is shipped daily through #Canadianwaters. More tankers than #KinderMorgan will ever see.
182 2018-03-19 23:39:24 Castor oil helps too
183 2018-03-19 23:39:00 I use black seed oil every night before going to sleep, my co-worker recommended it he works for the Whole Body department. I use coconut oil in the daytime
184 2018-03-19 23:38:39 Shot opppp you use amla oil. You fresh bag
185 2018-03-19 23:38:16 Her pinta smelled like hot oil

187 2018-03-19 23:37:47 Hemp oil Cannabis oil without the THC that's your natural remedy to pain relief prescription drugs just make you feel better don't solve the problem like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound
188 2018-03-19 23:37:35 i was slacking off, applying for my PFD, in my history of energy class exactly when they were talking about the beginning of Alaskan oil production, which is hilarious
189 2018-03-19 23:37:34 I thought your argument was that oil was worthless
190 2018-03-19 23:37:22 Love transit until someone drops a bottle of fish oil on the #skytrain.
191 2018-03-19 23:37:19 If people like you lived like they preach imagine the good work that would actually get done. Instead you rather stick a gun to everyone else’s head and tell them to pay up. It’s amazing people buy into your snake oil.
192 2018-03-19 23:37:10 Singham talking snake oil bollocks as usual...
193 2018-03-19 23:37:09 Gotta pretty big tool time coming up. Oil change, spark plugs, and control arm 
194 2018-03-19 23:36:45 Is that a rotary? I really hope you put some 2 stroke oil in with the fuel every now and again or they tend to die (or so I've heard)
195 2018-03-19 23:36:30 I hope you’re right….kind of. I also do worry about the impacts when policy makers and politicians believe the cyber/infowar snake oil and act accordingly. (Remember that it is the anniversary of “Iraqi Freedom” & such ideologies were all the rage then too.)
196 2018-03-19 23:36:24 Just when I think my skin cannot possibly produce any more oil, it never ceases to amaze 
197 2018-03-19 23:36:13 FWIW I have started taking CBD oil and I think it helps with both pain and anxiety. You can get it online (but make sure it's not hempSEED oil, not the same thing)

202 2018-03-19 23:35:01 I need my car cleaned inside and out and my oil changed  sounds like a job for Artel 
203 2018-03-19 23:35:00 Using their moronic neighbor to the north to fight for the interests of their own industry at home.  Who would want to pay a fair market value for Alberta oil when they can use the dumbest policiticans in the world to protect their discount.
204 2018-03-19 23:34:56 OO.i know this from working food processing plants,,,oil refineries and i even worked a copper mine,,,,all the same.
205 2018-03-19 23:34:46 @Wilt_Thou_Oil Ok give me your top combo. for diffusing!  Thanks for connecting.
206 2018-03-19 23:34:27 Lil Olive Oil
207 2018-03-19 23:33:41 Lol! The republicans themselves are saying the trade tariffs will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Coal is dead and oil is on its way out. Jobs are readily available in wind and renewable energy.
208 2018-03-19 23:33:32 This is really quite unrealistic. We need oil and will do for some time.

211 2018-03-19 23:32:31 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
212 2018-03-19 23:32:31 I would love to get my oil changed ONE TIME without men w knuckle tats trying to get my number.
213 2018-03-19 23:32:26 Me: This hair oil smells like that fish food block I used to buy for my goldfish.
Me 5 min later: Girl, you can remember the smell of the gold fish food from 10 years ago, but you couldn't remember paper towels at the grocery store this morning?!
214 2018-03-19 23:32:23 Possible but last 20 years cons led by Grover norquist have linked special interest groups guns, taxes, abortion, oil etc so they all work together to funnel money and support into politics in a coordinated way so maybe backfire with NRA but doubt it, too much synergy to quit
215 2018-03-19 23:32:17 This witch hazel and tea tree oil is not helping my piercings heel at all  l just want this pain to go away and for this to heal 
216 2018-03-19 23:32:17 One way to make #keto vegetable dishes taste lighter is to use olive oil instead of butter, which makes a big difference. It may not feel like spring yet here in #Boston, but we are ramping up for #Ramps (only 5.5 net carbs for half a cup).
217 2018-03-19 23:32:11 No, I don’t think we should ignore our oil. It’s an important resource and we can do remarkable things with it. But we desperately need to get to a place where it’s not the biggest game in town.
218 2018-03-19 23:31:39 They are playing Ke$ha at the oil change place
219 2018-03-19 23:31:37 Stay on them Bernie , its got to stop , he greed has to stop , it funnels right thru wall street and banking systems , pharma companies , big oil , America wake up ! Trump and GOP r jot doing us any favors !
220 2018-03-19 23:31:33 I'm confused about the relevance here. So Washington state's leadership has nothing to lose while Canada, Alberta and even B.C. have tons to lose. I guess the fact that they will be buying refined oil from ... um... let's say ... Washington that explains their position..
221 2018-03-19 23:31:31 Have you ever gone to get an oil change before that doesn’t include $740 worth of stuff they also recommend me to do or is it just me?
222 2018-03-19 23:31:20 Let's also remember she threw farmers and ranchers under the bus when it came to their property rights against a foreign oil company. @SenatorFischer lost her way a long time ago. @JaneRaybould will represent our families with integrity.
223 2018-03-19 23:31:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however American futures.

227 2018-03-19 23:30:45 Gotta love how I had to basically browbeat my landlord into agreeing not to discuss billing issues with her contractor. Roommate got stopped in the driveway so he could tell my roommate I'm "a nut" because I was unhappy my landlord tried to bill me for her oil delivery.
228 2018-03-19 23:30:44 9/10 I’ll forget to even use an oil but I thought I was alone! Seems like everyone uses conditioner, cream, gel, oil
229 2018-03-19 23:30:43 my uncle outside tryna change his own oil u like a okie
230 2018-03-19 23:30:26 And use our reserves when the KSA and opec runs out, here we come w the oil at 500 a barrel. 

Like democrats tried to combine socialism w fascism for their benefits...and the death of freedom

235 2018-03-19 23:29:44 Politics and environmental damage will always get in the way with massive amounts of oil...
236 2018-03-19 23:29:24 I feel daft. 

I've always asked "Why are there climate change deniers? How can they shirk just this one thing scientifically?"

Blue collar workers that WORK for coal, gas, and oil companies would be out of jobs. Possibly work they've done for generations. Duh. 
237 2018-03-19 23:29:14 Reality is taking time to assert itself. But do not be mistaken. In oil, reality asserts itself eventually.
238 2018-03-19 23:28:56 My biggest regret of the day was not using the oil before class. Now I’m stuff in a plastic chair for two hours and my ass is already numb 
239 2018-03-19 23:28:50 We better hope advanced aliens don't visit Earth.

240 2018-03-19 23:28:47 <Ding> Your car is due for an oil change.  Two days later, <Ring,ring> “Hi, we got a notification from your car that it’s time for an oil change.  Did you want to schedule that?”  Creepy!
241 2018-03-19 23:28:41 Now, if the Europeans could only wake up to his snake oil barker show while he's there, we've have him extradited.
242 2018-03-19 23:28:30 One question. 
Why do we park in a driveway and drive in a parkway?
Well?
243 2018-03-19 23:28:23 Great guess... basket of resources would b ideal, w ability to add a as we advance, pockets of rare earth minerals all around, when one is found, deep state says hush, and they nationalize the land, and who knows, I would think same strategy used with oil, to drive prices up...
244 2018-03-19 23:28:20 You want to discuss the theft of CDN resources. Take a look at what the US pays us for the same oil we could be selling at world market prices instead. That's theft!
245 2018-03-19 23:28:15 They refer to less than exemplary behavior and all their policies encourage this behavior.  Insanity is continuing with the same policies and expecting a different outcome.  #Socialismfails
246 2018-03-19 23:28:02 To everyone out there who owns a car, please be careful! I fell for a scam today. “Toyota” called me about getting an extended warranty. They had all my car records (last oil change, mileage, etc). So I thought it must be legit. Now I’m out $50 until my banks claim goes through.

249 2018-03-19 23:27:29 My, (admittedly shallow) understanding of the expansion is that it will barely, or not even, handle the output that is already online or nearly online which means hopefully less oil discount for the oil sold to the states.

#YESiCAN !!!
254 2018-03-19 23:26:46 Of course it hasn't. After supplying a portion of the export demand, there is no remaining capacity. That is why we need the twin. So there is room to ship refined product AND increase the amount of oil available for sale at WORLD prices. Not discounted US prices.
255 2018-03-19 23:26:44 My sister is making fun of me because I wanted to use an oil filter wrench to open a jelly jar 

It would work though

Also "next" where you name a place (eg Rome), next person then has to name a place starting in your last letter ("e")
257 2018-03-19 23:26:27 I think it’s a way for auto manufacturers to deflect away from electric cars, to produce self driving cars; simply because in my humble opinion oil producing middle eastern nations have grabbed our governments and car companies by the balls and won’t let go.
258 2018-03-19 23:25:34 Today I took my car to get cleaned, I bought new windshield wipers, I got an oil change and filled up my tank. Am I considered a car girl yet?? 
259 2018-03-19 23:25:09 lavender oil + vanilla extract + water and boom! you have car air freshener
260 2018-03-19 23:24:37 Because more problems are good, yes. Oil leak, and front right CV making noise, and now phone is showing signs of battery being very near end of life. Let's just spend all the time and money I don't have, sure.

266 2018-03-19 23:24:03 he would add extra seasoning and serve them with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil

269 2018-03-19 23:23:51 I call bullshit on the claims that the oil industry has 11,000 high-paying jobs in NZ - but even if it did, what's the point of 11000 jobs today if there are no jobs tomorrow? #nzpol
270 2018-03-19 23:23:51  I just texted my sister in law if I need to put oil when frying eggs smfh
271 2018-03-19 23:23:47 I can't find that app - is it available on android does anyone know? I've found another one but it's American and dosnt have the barcode scanner. If anyone could post a link to the app I'd be really grateful. Palm oil free shopping is such hard work :( #ethicalhour
272 2018-03-19 23:23:42 Lavender oil get the best quality you can.
273 2018-03-19 23:23:23 Nobody is suggesting we can or should stop all oil use or production tomorrow. We're saying that to make the transition away from fossil fuels that we have to in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, we have to stop looking for new oil.
274 2018-03-19 23:23:20 I definitely want to try eggs and the fish oil! Hopefully all of this will help his highness like his food better

279 2018-03-19 23:22:48 Stat Oil & others quote $15 / b extraction costs which have now been reduced to $12/b since the redundancies. There is plenty profit even at $50/b

281 2018-03-19 23:22:41 The point is about the choices you made. You courted Steve Bannon. You courted Mercer's millions and Russian oil money. You sided with the discredited Leave Campaign.  You boasted about cyber weaponry.  You exploited FaceBook's naivety.  You are the enemy. #jailcambridgeanalytica
282 2018-03-19 23:22:41 The problem is, he may really think that is what he wants. Embrace Russia? How long will that last? Oh, there is oil and pipelines involved. This is a Russia, Iran, Turkey, Assad deal.
283 2018-03-19 23:22:36 Constantly. Like, it's a problem. They don't have meetings for such doings. If they did I'd go and masturbate there, and on the drive to and from too. Send a woman with loose morals, I'm almost out of coconut oil.

289 2018-03-19 23:21:19 I don’t know why I shake my head like I know what’s going on when the people at Valvoline show me my new oil levels after an oil change. Like I know what that stick is supposed to look like.

293 2018-03-19 23:20:54 Currently it is beyond the realm of possibility, because people, companies and governments continue to fail to invest appropriately and with conviction into renewable energy, and instead double down on oil and carbon.  /1
294 2018-03-19 23:20:48 I like to chill out by taking essential oil baths

298 2018-03-19 23:19:46 And he is 100% right.  She has always been a strident activist, and a "force" of good...ramming it down our throats on what faux libs define as "good"...like my mother use to give castor oil...can't wait till she's history as with McGuinty.. Trudeau, Butts, Telford et al next.
299 2018-03-19 23:19:40 In all seriousness, what form do you think we need to be more creative about? Ignoring our oil opportunities and generating revenue other ways?
300 2018-03-19 23:19:36 If you’re in the market for tanning oil, check out Bali body!! They have a watermelon and a pineapple tanning oil and it smells like dole whip omg (just don’t forget sunscreen plzzz)

302 2018-03-19 23:19:22 You don't get to have it both ways.
Either we're the cleanest and most ethical oil producers, or we ship it raw to China to be processed by Chinese standards.
303 2018-03-19 23:19:19 Our government got a petition delivered yesterday to stop mining new oil fields .Our media think the world will end . Our economy will crumble and we will all die .For god sakes it’s the opposite.Our govts are killing us in their quest for tax dollars .Our economy is agriculture

313 2018-03-19 23:17:34 Poor move is right, Brent. But it’s a little too late now. In all honesty though, I don’t believe ONE of my brothers country friends would change my oil, let alone check it.

319 2018-03-19 23:16:36 I have heard about any changes in the macro narrative. Want to be clear I have not chased it in about a week so my eye is not as sharp. Focusing on TVIX and Oil. Gas and gold were giving my fits.
320 2018-03-19 23:16:14 FYI she’s a fraud. Snake oil salesperson.
321 2018-03-19 23:16:12 Abserloutely Tom, took words right out of my mouth. Similarly next article you read that’s pessimistic about “people being ready for EVs” change to “I have interests in oil companies”
322 2018-03-19 23:15:54 Just the facts man! Trudeau the oil millionaire is very disrespected.
323 2018-03-19 23:15:44 I was with EURO when OTS. And I was hoping it was right. I did oil up my shovel tho and I also stayed at a @HolidayInn last night.
324 2018-03-19 23:15:39 Soon to be replaced by the sound of an oil rig on top of their bones.
325 2018-03-19 23:15:38 Ontario should only see the usual increases during the busy vacation season. Oil is steady at $60/bbl and refinery capacity is good.
326 2018-03-19 23:15:35 Yaudah naikin aja. Apa susahnya.. nanti kalau oil 30 dolar harusnya 4000.
327 2018-03-19 23:15:34 There is little difference between a pastor and a comedian.  At least the comedian is telling you he’s selling snake oil up front

331 2018-03-19 23:15:22 You think we are going to find suitable replacements for oil within 32 years? That is beyond the realm of realism. How many products have you personally stopped using because they are petroleum byproducts, contain them or packaged in them? #highhorse

334 2018-03-19 23:15:08 But thats also true. Trinidad has a lot of money from oil and is a socialist economy for the most part. Academia reflects this circumstance

342 2018-03-19 23:14:33 OIL BRENT US$66.11/bbl -0.12%. Total buys 20% in Umm Shaif-Nasr and 5% of Lower Zakum in UAE for US$1.45bn; net 80kbpd of oil.
343 2018-03-19 23:14:15 @SamSeder how can you honestly argue that money paid to Schumer by interests don’t influence him bc the two “just agree on issues”, and the next day argue the GOP is beholding to NRA money and Big Oil? This is patently hypocritical. Money clearly influences our politicians.
344 2018-03-19 23:14:12 I'm really exhausted of the people who keep saying 'it doesn't matter what we do, the big oil companies make all the pollution anyway'
Yes, they make an incredible deal of pollution. But telling people it isn't worth it because they can't make a big difference is -very- harmful.
345 2018-03-19 23:14:09 I was writing reviews on Amazon for stuff I bought because I was bored and one of them was Call Me By Your Name and the other was a Tea Tree Oil face wash and I wasn’t looking and accidentally reviewed CMBYN like “feels great on my skin, my favourite new face product”
346 2018-03-19 23:14:06 The only difference between a software bot and a bio-bot is the fuel, and hours of availability. Software bots are 24/7, run on oil/coal. 

Bio-bots run on carbohydrates, require daily down-time. Otherwise, they communicate with each other, reinforce each other.

349 2018-03-19 23:13:45 No problem. Some recipes, they add a little melted butter to the batter. No good for you being vegan and not sure what it adds, as I haven't tried it. Photos please. If you like a funnel with muslin, drain the oil into a bottle when cold and reuse it each time you make them.

355 2018-03-19 23:12:33 If we can spend billions of pounds /euros / dollars on sending kids to war in the middle east to secure the thousand mile long oil pipelines I'm sure hell that we can pipe water from one corner of the globe to another. #ThinkBigger

374 2018-03-19 23:10:05 I love it when they call us shills, and then refer us to Rowbotham, who made money lecturing about flat Earth and selling snake oil calling himself “Doctor” Birley.
375 2018-03-19 23:09:58 EVERYONE, YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT A NEW BOOK THAT WILL BE COMING OUT IN MAY, IT IS CALLED "THE KILLING OF UNCLE SAM".

380 2018-03-19 23:09:31 Could he not be the “scoring winger” the Oil are looking for. Could have had 30 goals if he didn’t get injured. 
381 2018-03-19 23:09:23 That's a damn shame then.
382 2018-03-19 23:09:14 If you’re congested at all, it might be humidity. An air humidifier with some kind of essential oil like peppermint might be super helpful and it helps with pain!!! Otherwise, a neti pot. The least caffeine possible as well momentarily

388 2018-03-19 23:08:30 That sucks for coconut oil manufacturers; but, as long as good quality coconut oil remains available for good prices, I'm happy. I cook with olive or avocado oil. I use coconut oil for skincare products.

392 2018-03-19 23:07:59 I recommend lightly brushing the buns with olive oil (or butter) and toast them on the griddle before adding everything else, it'll elevate it to the next level! :D
393 2018-03-19 23:07:58 I just make it to my tastes but a rough estimate is 1-2 tbs brown sugar/honey/sweetener 1/4 cup soy sauce, splash of vinegar, splash of sesame oil, 1/4 cup beef broth some crushed red pepper flakes, and some fresh grated ginger.
394 2018-03-19 23:07:54 I’ve used so much peppermint oil today that i smell like Christmas and I still have a migraine
395 2018-03-19 23:07:21 This tea tree oil saved my life
396 2018-03-19 23:07:09 Think where things would be if Harper didn't push oil over manufacturing causing a high $ & decimating SWO manufacturing. Ask yourself if ON pursued tight fiscal policies like the UK or PIIGS in pushing austerity, where the economy would be today? These things effect real people.

399 2018-03-19 23:07:00 The light is usually oil change.  But the stuff they talk about when discussing service items, i.e. acc. belts, timing belts, any fluids, brakes, suspension etc, can be confusing if you're not familiar with it.
400 2018-03-19 23:06:26 and exports, thing is the only thing we export now is oil because the government went on an holy war on private property to seize the means of production. The result? they mismanaged everything and ran all industry to the ground. Yes, all industries. /2 (am I doing this right?)

403 2018-03-19 23:06:10 I just paid 180 dollars for a doctor to use the words “I’ll take your word for it” for my self diagnosis and to “put mineral oil on it”... then telling me I was wrong when I said I couldn’t hear out of one of my ears. American Healthcare at its finest.
404 2018-03-19 23:06:00 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
405 2018-03-19 23:05:59 Hw much did publishing cost you
406 2018-03-19 23:05:57 Well considering that Ireland produces pretty much no oil or gas of its own, I imagine their economy will be just fine

419 2018-03-19 23:03:29 And then kicks that off by implying that ‘those people’ aren’t likely to be well spoken.   MSM would be pouncing if that came from a non-lefty.   
420 2018-03-19 23:03:18 At the oil shop, I spot an oil called 'Black Woman'.

Me: So what the hell does Black Woman smell like? We have a smell? Stfu.

Sales clerk: 

Me: Where is the White Woman oil? Does she have a scent?

Sales clerk: I want you to smell.

Me: ♡ You got it down, I'll take 1

423 2018-03-19 23:02:34 I have severe neuropathy myself - the thing that works best is cannabis. CBD oil is legal in all 50 states (because the THC has been removed). Opioids didn't even touch the pain. With the CBD oil, I can feel my fingers and actually walk barefoot again.

428 2018-03-19 23:02:01 Our cat knocked the vegetable oil off the counter, the dogs stole it and managed to chew the lid off, and everyone had a grand time licking up the oil. Needless to say I am out of oil and I forsee a very bad booty situation for all of my pets. Send help. And carpet cleaner.
429 2018-03-19 23:01:56 This is the lamest argument for oil I’ve ever heard. And I’m well aware of it’s requirements for modern industry.

431 2018-03-19 23:01:47 Sure- which is why getting rid of Cuomo is so needed.  Albany needs to be blown up.

New York is the richest state in the nation (ignoring Alaska with its weird oil money) yet schools and subways aren't adequately funded.  That's on Cuomo after 8 years.

446 2018-03-19 23:00:20 The next time you travel on a highway or street, think about which type of oil is used on the surface, it's not top grade. All countries what our oil for more than feul.
447 2018-03-19 23:00:16 Trains go off the tracks all the time. Oil should not be on rolling stock.
448 2018-03-19 23:00:16 So, going by that logic, it would be okay to turn Europe into burning hell, because of all the madness that was going on there hundreds and thousands of years ago?

The US has NOTHING to do in Iraq or anywhere in the ME, other than Israels interests and oil.

Oil filled heaters rather than halogen,  better yet would be a super ser style gas heater. Tinfoil behind radiators can help heat spread as well.

475 2018-03-19 22:55:40 I've never thought about subbing natural peanut butter for the oil! Probably because I tend to only have regular PB on hand and I'll just throw a dollop in. But that's a great idea!

502 2018-03-19 22:52:02 If you’re a ‘nationalist’ you shouldn’t rely on an oil economy. 

Oil consumption causes destruction of nature. Destroying Scotland’s climate and *stunning* scenery through oil consumption isn’t fitting with ‘loving’ your country. 

Love scotland? Drop the oil.
503 2018-03-19 22:51:55 I'm with you there. And the concentration of econ/political power in question here is the dying fossil fuel industry.

507 2018-03-19 22:51:46 We actually assumed we’d run out of oil. Again. And felt quite stupid. Only to discover the tank is one third full, so it’s the boilers fault. Thankfully we have two stoves keeping the place warm. Pain in the arse tho.
508 2018-03-19 22:51:43 I hate getting my oil changed or doing any type of maintenance on my car. This shit takes way too long 
509 2018-03-19 22:51:36 I like the city and all, but people here don't pronounce the word "oil" like they have a mouth full of it like they do back home and idk, it's just not the same..
510 2018-03-19 22:51:33 Catfish-related waste is important. But we have a whale in the White House that has all but devoured our democracy. Some institutional foundations still sticking out of his mouth ready to be swallowed while the fishermen are watching hoping the whale will yield some useful oil.
511 2018-03-19 22:51:20 Another way to look at this is: who really needs to add a large chunk of long-term exposure to oil, at this point? Myriad, liquid vehicles exist already; institutions are cutting, not adding, oil exposure; and the outlook is not bright.
512 2018-03-19 22:51:09 It’s not like percaps, the money comes from oil and gas production.
513 2018-03-19 22:51:09 Who's minding these chickens ? The farmers are heading towards unemployment along with the fishermen. At least we have our oil and gas....wait, what ?

550 2018-03-19 22:45:07 The only reason you would want to ship more oil to Westridge, is if you were planning on putting that oil on a tanker. We don’t have the refinery capacity in B.C. for more oil and they won’t be building another one here, so again the primary motive is shipping oil by sea.
551 2018-03-19 22:45:06 Ofcourse I dont mind! You’re more than welcome to ask.. I use @GaryRomHair products (its a South African brand but its also sold online) their cool silver shampoo is magical, the cortex repair mask as a conditioner and the sheer brilliance oil are my 3 favourites
552 2018-03-19 22:44:51 Been at this shop for over a fckin hour and they still haven't done my oil change.. never again will I do this shit on my own 
553 2018-03-19 22:44:46 There isn't pumpkin oil in Japan ;_;

You make me want to go to EU!
554 2018-03-19 22:44:46 Sadam Hussein (Adolf Hitler) kills his own citizens & invades Kuwait (The Rhineland) to use its oil (coal) to feed his war machine. From 1934 to 1939 no one did a thing except go to the Olympics in Berlin.
555 2018-03-19 22:44:42 Meanwhile in Azersheepdjan:
-Drink oil
-fuck a sheep
-Suck erdogan and Aliev
-kill armenian in Hungary when his sleeping
-go jaill
-return sheep contry and be a hero
-drink oil
-have a good sheep sexual life
-Killed by an armenian drunked sheep
-go in Hell
- drink oil with Hitler
556 2018-03-19 22:44:29 If you work in the tourism industry, your future is dependent on oil. If you work in an export industry, your future is dependent on oil.
557 2018-03-19 22:44:12 Because I don’t have time, I’m not carrying hundreds of people and if my oil light comes on I’ll pull over.   Ohhh and I don’t have my garage full of engineers.
558 2018-03-19 22:44:09 Cane to get my oil changed..man said “what oil do you use, what do you prefer we use?”...I’m a faggot I don’t know what you’re talking about just use whatever!
559 2018-03-19 22:44:03 Let me see if I can guess this one: they want to learn how to sue oil companies, forcing them to charge higher prices, which they hope will have the same effect as a carbon tax. Or how to kill their business through excessive government regulations?
560 2018-03-19 22:43:31 Way more train derailments with oil than pipeline bursts ! Look it up !

566 2018-03-19 22:42:39 No, what he should do is: Enforce the Russian Sanctions; Allow our country to defend itself against Russian cyber attacks; Forget the damned wall; Forget allowing big oil  and coal from ruining our environment; forget womanizing for 15 minutes;  Forget kissing Putin's ass & on &.
567 2018-03-19 22:42:34 The smoke shop by my house is selling CBD oil & I am so excited to try it.
568 2018-03-19 22:42:15 Canada is selling oil at half price and buying it at full price. Liberal thinking. These people are not very intelegent.
569 2018-03-19 22:42:14 @PeterHartcherAO dont fall for blaming Myanmar, Its the worlds troublemakers wanting to do a deal with Rohonigya over oil and gas in the future. They are using HRW etc to push this agenda - George Soros meddling again. You helping him

573 2018-03-19 22:41:13 i really bet dabin drizzles coconut oil on his head
574 2018-03-19 22:41:09 I’m ridiculously dry, L’Oreal does a facial oil, it’s meant for 50-60 year old skin but when mixed with a foundation makes my skin so plump and moisturises! It’s the age perfect oil, about £20 last I checked :)
575 2018-03-19 22:41:04 Oh yeah. And then the people who ask of they can get the same oil or whatever at AutoZone. I've started just saying "I don't know, I don't work at AutoZone. I work here. You'd have to call them and ask them."
576 2018-03-19 22:40:54 Windwhistle Red: straws, sourdough bites, Pierrot assorted cookies, garlic & olive oil crackers, asiago cheese spread. The decorative
577 2018-03-19 22:40:42 That would be considered racist on what he said.
578 2018-03-19 22:40:37 Don't suppose you have any oil? Or other moistures?
579 2018-03-19 22:40:37 even tho he may fall in the apostasy (2Thess2:3) because I doubt he has enough oil in his lamp, he is still a Christian, and the left (towards communism/socialism from atheism) do hate him. It is written.
580 2018-03-19 22:40:31 But that traffic isn’t up for discussion, #KM is...until it gets either built or killed. I’m betting the political pressure NOT to introduce substantially more oil tanker traffic out of Westridge will prevail as more of the public finds out what the pipeline is really all about.

591 2018-03-19 22:39:30 Nope a bag of potatoes here is 5-$8 pkg - a bag of frozen chips is less than $2  there r lots of examples- butter vs margarine vs cost of making your own, mince vs buying a premade burger, canola oil vs coconut oil- ready made is mostly cheaper &then there is question of access
592 2018-03-19 22:39:29 Gato dicen que Oil se la quieren entregar a YPF, para después darcela a un amigo empresario que empieza con M el apellido, puede ser??
593 2018-03-19 22:39:22 Just log off mate I've never spoken about Lacazette in my life by now that you mention it morata spends more time putting oil in his hair than playing
594 2018-03-19 22:39:20 def get a toner & moisturizer too and it’ll help w the oil. tea tree oil by itself hurts like a mf but it rlly does help 
595 2018-03-19 22:39:07 I was their to be fair, 2 secs before that footage you will see him get attacked by a short mask man with the same stick. He took the stick off him and the rest you all can see.
596 2018-03-19 22:39:00 I wonder o, because I want to prove myself as a good petrol chemical engineer I will leave shell oil company to iya Risi palm oil company?
597 2018-03-19 22:38:53 You did NOT grow up poor. Your grandmother was the VP of a bank.  Maybe thats why you systematically took away our rights & let #occupywallstreet protesters be brutalized. Turns out Lolo Soetoro was a brutal oil tycoon as well-being. You’re a conman. The richest POTUS in history.
598 2018-03-19 22:38:43 ur work is always so gorgeous n i love how you paint w/ all the layers of colour omgg ,, is hyungwon in acrylic or oil, i love that one so much aa !! (i thought the former but it looks kinda oil like; if so, what mixed media sketchbook do u use? thank youu~)
599 2018-03-19 22:38:40 From a variety of sources related to oil exploitation.
600 2018-03-19 22:38:26 They have a right to a nuclear program. It's called diversifying their sources of energy. The west wants Iran to be weak & dependent on oil. But nowadays with investments from Russia, China, and India, the west is losing its influence & throwing a tantrum. Cry more *yawn*

603 2018-03-19 22:38:04 I’ll try it. I use the tea tree oil wash and my skin is 10x better but doesn’t help with the blemishes and discoloration so 
604 2018-03-19 22:38:01 And it was reported Russia went after or tried Canada oil. Cons support pipelines more than LIBS.This is all propaganda Russian style!
605 2018-03-19 22:37:55 Obviously because the protest was funded by Arab Oil money.

618 2018-03-19 22:36:17 These people gushed and eat chain up from "the powers you think I have" man 5 years ago. You'd think they'd learn and monitor the situation before taking out the oil from the alabaster box to anoint the feet of our latest saviour.

622 2018-03-19 22:35:31 Human behavior is insane, the states in their eagerness to increase their finances based on the extraction of oil and coal have conditioned our extinction, we must stop the mining of fossil fuels.

Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork, add a spritz of lime juice and olive oil and a sprinkle of cilantro.
639 2018-03-19 22:33:11 Yes, but to equal the stored chemical energy of any single oil field, it would take tens of millions of years of all the life in the area dying & collecting on the sea floor. If all the life on earth today died,  it would not equal the stored energy of one Texas oil field

651 2018-03-19 22:31:11 Her car was leaking oil and blew a rod in the engine and then the water pump went out in the new one and warped the head in the engine... she’s currently using my car 
652 2018-03-19 22:31:02 this is why so many US military generals question "what's our endgame in the ME?" since 2007 & it's all about this oil pipeline because Israel has nothing of its own to export (ie natural resources)

669 2018-03-19 22:29:29 ....because you need votes. When you succeed in your election, you will then bring out the real devil in you. You will start to narrate how the oil in Rivers or Delta belongs to your family and cronies. Have you spoken to condemn the killer Fulani Herdsmen? Of course not.
670 2018-03-19 22:29:23 I bet he's got an oil painting in the attic that looks exactly like Gregg Araki.
671 2018-03-19 22:29:03 No they found it too silly because it is such a ridiculous claim. His argument that if we dug up and burned all the oil in the oil sands defies logic, common sense or simple physics.  It is made by individuals unconcerned with facts and the Globe and Mail cares about facts
672 2018-03-19 22:28:59 Omg babe that’s why you don’t go to a dealership for an oil change you should’ve called me!

684 2018-03-19 22:27:24 That’s because Paul Martin’s magical tankers don’t ever leak, plus the Saudi oil that the tankers carry doesn’t create any C02/ as well, it’s not anti woman/anti gay

686 2018-03-19 22:26:56 U choose to ignore d fact  oil marketers were n stil are in control of the importation ,storage ,mrkting n distrbutn of oil accross nig
687 2018-03-19 22:26:50 The USA is irrelevant anyway. China is now the world superpower and the largest purchaser of oil. Venezuela has the largest known oil reserve. If China buys the Petro it will be huge. If China doesn't buy then it will be worthless.

689 2018-03-19 22:26:46 Nothing! Wars are being started for reasons other than protecting the homeland. Iraq was invaded because the USA wanted the oil. Who knows why Saudi is blowing up Yemen. USA and Russia are fighting in Syria because they can.

692 2018-03-19 22:26:17 Unfortunately Kenney is saying that oil is the single defining trait of Alberta since as he says being anti-oil mean being anti Alberta.

That is just sad.

705 2018-03-19 22:24:59 The USA would rather the people of Venezuela starve to death rather than allow a socialist regime to survive. The USA would do the same to China if they could. The USA creates money out of thin air but they will not allow a socialist country to have a currency back by oil.

715 2018-03-19 22:23:39 The beauty of stopping oil exploration is that if clean power doesn't work out after all, we sat on our oil reserves for longer, and they'll be worth more when we do exploit them.

What matters to them is marketing that drives consumer demand.

826 2018-03-19 22:06:41 Just points out why we shouldn't give our oil away to foreign owned companies to import back at greedy prices. Thanks to tories who didn't encourage the building of Canadian refineries.
827 2018-03-19 22:06:05 25% of the carbon budget by 2035 for 1.5- 2C will be used for the 20% of the world that fly .Not very equitable when the rest of us are trying to cycle to save a few drops of oil
828 2018-03-19 22:05:58 Good point. If only Canadian owned oil corporations received this corporate welfare there’d be hell to pay. As it is they’re enjoying taking our money.
829 2018-03-19 22:05:50 and I can’t even stop to get oil cause Cocoa in the car
830 2018-03-19 22:05:48 May I point out, again..Hillary was very focused, laid out her vision & MSM often cut from her talking to gatherings to Trump getting on an airplane, Trump spewing crap,etc. But she held her ground/focus. And, many are just naive, and believe the snake oil salesman w/promises...
831 2018-03-19 22:05:46 Home Bargains £1 Beard Oil works fine.
832 2018-03-19 22:05:41 We were told by Harper and his henchmen that the response on the west coast was "world class", and yet it took a couple days to respond to a diesel spill. We do need better response resources since there are now oil tankers on the coast. Dilbit is another level completely.
833 2018-03-19 22:05:35 That vitamin e oil and coconut oil is amazing
834 2018-03-19 22:05:33 Funnily enough I got rid of the telly a few days after I started musing on whether Oil of Olay would actually delay my first wrinkle. It's more than 10 years now since I binned the TV and the wrinkle still hasn't appeared.
835 2018-03-19 22:05:27 Geweldig.Verplichte kost voor politici. Reacties voorspelbaar : Van Beurden hoort bij Big Oil, het fossiele kamp e.d. Als we willen kan het. Let op : iets dergelijks wordt de reactie van Urgenda, Milieudefensie en andere leden van de Groene Khmer, zoals Groen Links en Greenpeace.

837 2018-03-19 22:04:56 Dude. They lied their asses off. They never mentioned carbon levies AT ALL. They hired known pipeline activists to head advisory panels on oil sands and pipelines. And Notley herself promised balanced budgets.

853 2018-03-19 22:02:43 Why didn't any other country's oil industry fail due to, you know, failing global markets?
854 2018-03-19 22:02:42 Heavens, that Martlet looks like she’s got her motor going! Getting ready to launch  or simply trying to keep the oil warm?  Launch and recovery ops in those seas and that weather have my most sincere professional respect.
855 2018-03-19 22:02:36 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
856 2018-03-19 22:02:14 The USA is irrelevant anyway. China is now the world superpower and the largest purchaser of oil. Venezuela has the largest know oil reserve. If China buys the Petro it will be huge. If China doesn't buy then it will be worthless.
857 2018-03-19 22:02:14 of course he does!! You idiots! They buy our oil at half the frigging price ! and meanwhile US oil tankers go through he Straits unhindered !! WAKE UP !!
858 2018-03-19 22:02:10 But he didn’t lie like Trump does constantly. You do know how to tell ifTrump oil lying don’t you?? He’s lips are moving!
859 2018-03-19 22:02:05 We diverged from the rest of the UK via the 1706 Act of Union. Hence, separate banking, education and legal systems from the off.

The snake oil you're selling is nothing less than the merger of Scotland into England.
860 2018-03-19 22:02:01 Oil price seems to be struggling at the moment, economic uncertainty and nervous equity markets as well as US shale production does not provide much reason for the price to rally which does not help Aramco attain a $2 trillion valuation. @CNBCJou @russelljones25 @ZaksTradersCafe

870 2018-03-19 22:00:42 Japan imports oil from the US. Mineral fuels including oil: US$141.3 billion (21.1% of total imports)  Their economic structure is very different from Alberta.
871 2018-03-19 22:00:29 TRY BLACK CASTOR OIL 

Mango & Lime Jamaican Black Castor Oil is an excellent multi-purpose oil and affordable option. They even come in several scents with supportive oils for the hair such as lavender, mango papaya, coconut oil, and more.

876 2018-03-19 22:00:17 IMHO the whole argument about dilBit vs crude is a red herring. The fed govt and the oil industry has not put in the capacity to deal with  a big petro spill. The best they can do is 10% clean up. You can't clean it up. You have to prevent it from happening. TUGS and response.

881 2018-03-19 22:00:08 I just want to put in a good word for The Anointing Woman, my special patronus. I think of her every time I exfoliate and moisurize with coconut oil. She saw God, she knew where it was all going, she poured that 'nard with abandon. You have to.
882 2018-03-19 21:59:28 Seeing all the stuff he’s using to sit in the tree doesn’t come from a drop of oil
883 2018-03-19 21:59:26 I walked into monros to get a 15$ oil change and now paying 715$ in total repairs. What a day
884 2018-03-19 21:59:25 So, "the staggered implementation in hash oil and edibles regulations" is a horrible and awkward mouthful, and I'm tired of making journalists suffer through it.

I propose instead that we refer to it as The Dab Delay.

#dabdelay
885 2018-03-19 21:59:23 I’d rather be looking for new ways instead of oil waves 
886 2018-03-19 21:59:14 Oh, how I wish I didn't dislike the taste of cilantro. I bought some cilantro oil... is that in any way as effective?
887 2018-03-19 21:59:10 This is quite funny and ironic. Believe it or not,i live with a rare chronic mystery illness that includes extreme food intolerance. Salmon (frozen within 24 hours of catch), white rice, sunflower oil, salt are the only foods i can eat. I've eaten salmon at every meal for a year!

891 2018-03-19 21:59:01 microwave popcorn is the greatest sham: half are burnt and/or half haven't popped. just cut that shit open, throw it in a pan of hot oil and enjoy a uniformly delicious treat #food
892 2018-03-19 21:58:34 So sorry for any confusion! The coconut oil used is highly refined, which means it doesn’t contain the protein from the coconut, which is what causes the allergen. As this is not an allergen, it was not called out on the packaging. Thank you!
893 2018-03-19 21:58:26 It looks like a Victorian oil painting! Bet you couldn’t get them to pose like that again
894 2018-03-19 21:58:07 So I'm doing some number crunching and it looks like the Oil could be bumped out of the top 10 of this draft if they lose.. So those that follow this year's draft.. who do the Oilers go for if they are 7-12th? (Can't see them Winning the lottery)

897 2018-03-19 21:58:03 also my tip in return for both of your guys tips is to buy a cleansing oil and use it after a mask. i apply it and wait for 5 minutes and massage in circles and then i can feel my pores emptying. then u just tone and moisturise
898 2018-03-19 21:57:59 You can’t have closed borders, but no border in Ireland. You can’t make trade deals without pooling sovereignty. You can’t stop immigration to a country with an aging population without terminal economic decline. Brexit is snake oil.
899 2018-03-19 21:57:58 imagine blaming people for shipping real actors and that they see it but actually pooring oil on the fire the minute after and tagging them in it, shayaronnie can relate instead of having a life
900 2018-03-19 21:57:48 I am trying to figure out why becoming energy self sufficient somehow increased the going price of crude oil from $42.06 to $62.00, once regulations were eliminated and corporate taxes lowered. We need to get back to the Gold Standard and eliminate the petrodollar! #endglobalism
901 2018-03-19 21:57:43 Yall ever eat cookout and just taste every bit of peanut oil that they cook with

917 2018-03-19 21:55:42 What really matters is whether China buys it. China is the largest purchaser of oil and the new world superpower. Now that Yuan Oil Futures are starting on 26th March and countries like Saudi Arabia will be required to accept the Yuan it means the USD is no longer backed by oil.
918 2018-03-19 21:55:38 The market price of oil, fell today by -0.09 cents, or -0.14%, but yet still, the price for gasoline at the pumps in Ontario went up. Go figure again!

926 2018-03-19 21:54:30 takes a little muscle, but. if you already have the flexible water supply line it's straight forward . pop the caps covering the bolts and soak them with penetrating oil for as long as you can. make sure to have a new wax gasket

948 2018-03-19 21:51:54 2) the reason that statement isn't comprehensible to you is because those are Alberta regulations designed to reduce the carbon-intensity of oil sands crude to that of an average American crude... and you know nothing about them. My, my, you are informed, aren't you?

952 2018-03-19 21:51:34 It costs $532 to mine 1 BTC in Venezuela. The Chinese would probably love to swap mining gear for oil, at a discount. How will (must) Trump act on bitcoin if Maduro sets up a massive mining operation owned by the Venezuelan government? Scary thought. ASIC resistance ftw!

960 2018-03-19 21:50:22 PS... There was not actually a 1710 report published called "Darien: There's loads of oil....."

It was published in 1711 called : "Darien: The oil is just a bonus!"
961 2018-03-19 21:50:16 I had to make an adult executive decision get my nails done or my oil changed ! Well I post poned nail appointment 
962 2018-03-19 21:50:15 i eat so much garlic and olive oil wtf
963 2018-03-19 21:50:07 Sure, you get a pretty display for $100 but you don’t get a CAN expander w/ 3 additional 5v analog sensor inputs which lets me add fuel pressure, oil pressure, and oil temperature channels to my data logging.
964 2018-03-19 21:49:44 Full synthetic oil change damn near $100 ... well I don’t put bad food in my body so won’t put bad oil in my RT!
965 2018-03-19 21:49:38 Wtf kinda oil change you getting ?
966 2018-03-19 21:49:32 Ghost rider kakeji,Alhazan abj sunsha riding
967 2018-03-19 21:49:23 absolutely. data is the new oil
968 2018-03-19 21:49:05 Ohhh yes! Haha I didn’t know what you meant at first. I think CBD oil is a great alternative for someone that wants the benefits without the psychoactive effects. I just recently just got some to see if it helps with my anxiety so I don’t have to take pharmaceutical meds
969 2018-03-19 21:48:58 Venezuela was following the Nordic model, lol. Their crisis now is not related to how they approached socialism but in their reliance on oil revenue to fund basically everything, plus neo-colonialism.
970 2018-03-19 21:48:48 Possible that some oil leaked through and is sitting on top of the connector on ether the cart or battery, even a little bit would cause that to happen.
971 2018-03-19 21:48:35 My daughter does too That shea moisture shit is too heavy and it dries hard (the orange bottle) and I shouldn’t have got it cus ppl was saying that in the target reviews. I’m using mane choice kids now and Camille rose natural growth oil and it’s like my girl got a perm
972 2018-03-19 21:48:33 Oh the joys of renting a room for dance classes! They’ve run out of oil so no heating 
973 2018-03-19 21:48:29 Mr Swinney destroyed Edinburgh's finances with his panicky backing of Sue Bruce and Vic Emery in 2011....  and his *rescue* of Named Persons has been the biggest political time-wasting since the 1710 report :" Darien: Don't vote for Union it has loads of oil"was published.....
974 2018-03-19 21:48:22 He never knew that his Government was still running 'Oil Subsidy' scheme. 

He does not even know that Kaduna, Taraba, Plateau and Benue States have been hit with genocide led by the notorious Fulani Herdsmen. 

He didn't know the IGP flaunted his orders and left Benue same day.
975 2018-03-19 21:48:20 Some dildo at autozone tried to tell me what oil my bike takes.....
976 2018-03-19 21:48:19 Like 80% of Venezuela's economy is private, and also, their entire economy basically relies on oil. Also while things are bad thing, they've been exaggerated thanks to propaganda. Venezuela BTW has the largest oil reserves in the world. Coincidence?
977 2018-03-19 21:48:01 Sorry Tony in the midst of reno, watching my oil based paint dry. Maybe in 2047
978 2018-03-19 21:47:52 Little mans appointment in the morning then I need to go TC to pick my CBD Oil up! Fellow #MSERS have tried and say it works for them! What are your thoughts?
979 2018-03-19 21:47:13 Fish oil salesmen
980 2018-03-19 21:47:10 I got this cruelty free Argan oil conditioner but it comes in these small bottles and I already know my hair is gunna take half the damn bottle
981 2018-03-19 21:47:06 i have oil stains all the way down the side of my new lulus....im heatedddd
982 2018-03-19 21:46:54 For instance, canola is 46% oil which means 54% is waste ie pulp & husks, which gets fed to livestock.
Then you read that farmers waste most food and most food gets fed to animals. 
But it’s the waste that gets fed, if we weren’t feeding it to animals it would end up in landfill
983 2018-03-19 21:46:41 Since when is a sauce good if it’s ‘unctuous’? From the Latin ‘unctus’ meaning act of anointing.

“Mmm this oil of chrism jus is just divine”

984 2018-03-19 21:46:35 Oil should give some good trending days
985 2018-03-19 21:46:33 Never any doubt.

PMJT spends 3 days with steelworkers that don't need his help (no tarrifs) but can't find a way to get on the ground in Alberta or BC where oil workers DO need his help.

Steel is made with coal.  Didn't bother him a bit.  

Steel = Ontario.  Oil = Alberta.
986 2018-03-19 21:46:28 "An economy could be roaring along, but that is not much use to ordinary people if all that extra income, production and consumption is being enjoyed by a privileged elite. Until the crash of oil prices in 2014, the Angolan economy was growing at more  1/3
987 2018-03-19 21:46:25 Presently at 57% in the polls. Hard to believe they won't win, especially given protest against carbon tax in Alberta and the oil industry. We have to start planning national direction on facts instead of twisting policy to serve a special interest.  Story of Canada. #cdnpoli
988 2018-03-19 21:46:23 i’m talking about in terms of side effects! some people get really paranoid no matter what strains they’re smoking but CBD oil is great for that

990 2018-03-19 21:46:14 I expect there will be some midnight oil burning around the shredder tonight though!
991 2018-03-19 21:46:13 As of September 2014, foreigners owned $6.06 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $12.8 trillion and 34% of the total debt of $17.8 trillion. The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters.
992 2018-03-19 21:46:07 Venezuela is poorly ran country. If they can’t make a profit from crude oil. Why would I trust them with their new petro crypto? By investing in Venezuela petro crypto your only making their autocratic leader richer. If Citibank can’t make a profit there. Don’t invest.
993 2018-03-19 21:46:02 Baked ziti was just oil I'm taking it down now

998 2018-03-19 21:45:32 where were they when the Kurds were fighting ISIS? oh yeah buying cheap oil from ISIS. Now the war is won see how the Kurds are repaid

1019 2018-03-19 21:42:39 dont wash your face. coconut oil will make you flawless. exfoliating with scrubs will hell with acne. 
1020 2018-03-19 21:42:38 sausage, cheese, potato salad,I like it very much! 

but pumpkin oil？I've never heard that before.
1021 2018-03-19 21:42:28 hope you feel better soon - the only thing i can think of is inhaling some olbas oil or vicks but that only works if it’s a sinus-y headache
1022 2018-03-19 21:42:22 Ha! I did! But also glad there's some oil & gas/river taming fact-checking in those replies, even though I know the intent was humorous. :D New Orleans, the city that shouldn't exist, but by god I'm glad it does.
1023 2018-03-19 21:42:20 and just changed the oil in my truck.

Was time to do so....have today and tomorrow off work, so figured now was a good time to do it lol
1024 2018-03-19 21:42:18 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
1025 2018-03-19 21:42:18 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1026 2018-03-19 21:42:15 Well it could be that. Inhale steam, if you have peppermint or eucalyptus oil that will help clear them, or just a minty tea bag in steam. Unblock and hydrate.
1027 2018-03-19 21:42:00 Sinus headache or tension headache are top of the list of likely suspects. Sinuses: steam head over a sink of hot water with a drop of olbas oil in it. Tension headache: hot bath, cocoa, hot water bottle on back of neck, early night.
1028 2018-03-19 21:41:17 Thanks Dan. At what point do we shed ‘internet’ and just become mates? When I cover you in oil and push you in a jacuzzi full of ‘Bodian girls?

1033 2018-03-19 21:40:47 Gold's up nearly 50% in oil terms since that story was written.  Why isn't gold up in USD?  That will likely require a political decision somewhere...
1034 2018-03-19 21:40:41 We don't recommend misting with water & oil. Plain water would be better.

All I’ve got is a GREASY mess looking like I’ve hit the treadmill for the past day that won’t wash out bc silly me forgot that oil and water do NOT mix!!

Peddle your snake oil elsewhere.
1044 2018-03-19 21:39:09 You mean back when Trump was a Democrat and endorsed Hillary? Or did you forget that your snake oil salesman of a President was a Democrat until he saw he could win as a Republican!?!
1045 2018-03-19 21:39:05 Two words oil politics
1046 2018-03-19 21:38:52 I’m going to go and search for some oil. I expect some as soon as I get off the plane!
1047 2018-03-19 21:38:43 no oil you have to take care of the rivers and seas!
1048 2018-03-19 21:38:38 Not to nitpick but no, we haven't. We're acutely aware of your warmongering, oil theft and human rights abuses, racism, whitewashing of history and your horrific treatment of the native Americans. Don't lie to yourself.

1051 2018-03-19 21:38:18 I love going in to get my oil changed and being told I need over $1,200 worth of work done to my car :))))))))
1052 2018-03-19 21:38:08 I ever looked at an employee parking lot compared to a supervisor lot ? The difference in cars is amazing. And I’ll take one step further. The difference in oil spots Is  bigger. It’s not even about how nice your car is. It’s that most employees don’t even have a dependable car
1053 2018-03-19 21:38:00 Just sleep off my dear na ur papa get oil and gas
1054 2018-03-19 21:37:57 We shall see how this stirfry is going to be. I’m going to make thinly sliced pieces of steak with quinoa and blck beans. I’ll add some sesami seed oil as a sauce. I’ve got to make the steak with something since i took it out. This will happen later though.
1055 2018-03-19 21:37:55 Thanks ! Sad that Kurds, that put their lives on the line to stop suni salafist wahabbi Daesh,Qaeda, etc. would now be under deadly attack by sunni Turks, who already helped Jihad fighters sell Syria Oil in Turkey in exchange for weapons & explosives, very unfair !

1059 2018-03-19 21:37:34 Why do you think Iran and Turkey were forced to go sub rosa to exchange oil for gold? Hint: because there are people in high places paying VERY close attention to such things, and when they detect it, they will, if possible, prevent it with all their might.

1063 2018-03-19 21:37:19 Somehow, some way, there's something in this for you & the #FossilFuel industry. I don't know anything about chemistry, but I bet it has something to do with encouraging PFAS alternatives derived from natural gas, oil, & coal. #PollutingPruitt @jclement4maine

1068 2018-03-19 21:36:50 We've known that for a long time: Nigeria's economy is more diversified than often reported. The big income earner is Agriculture at over 45% followed by distributive trade (20%). Oil coming at third place only accounts for 15%.

1079 2018-03-19 21:35:35 That isn’t practical experience with vitamins, supplements, and nutrition. Which is why consumers ARE so vulnerable to the snake oil that is out there.

1101 2018-03-19 21:32:42 Press alert ! Stop the oil sands for 100 buffalo that the natives are poaching anyways, and the one guy that lives there year round. Don’t think so..
1102 2018-03-19 21:32:34 Excellent service by @jiffylube at 86th & Michigan Rd in Indianapolis. I have and will continue to get my car’s oil changed here due to their professionalism and honesty.
1103 2018-03-19 21:32:03 All this furore about Westminster and Tories selling oot the fishermen, that voted them in , and rejected indy, and probably voted brexit for too. Ye kin think the same thing about Scottish oil, and Aberdeen, or on the Clyde.

We are not family, we are assets to be stripped.
1104 2018-03-19 21:32:00 Just like #Iraq's Oil was going 2 pay 4 the #War! #GOVTLies!!!
1105 2018-03-19 21:31:54 @realDonaldTrump is setting table to refuse to meet Mueller. His strategy is as you say to 'brand' his opponents as dishonest & biased against him.  He's effective at branding others with nicknames but he's destroyed TRUMP brand. In court the snake oil salesman will be defeated.
1106 2018-03-19 21:31:49 Yes, the government tried running the oil business and ran it into the ground.
1107 2018-03-19 21:31:37 Also coconut oil is madd healthy for you. It keeps you satiated thru the day, and reduces hunger pangs. 

This ain't my first rodeo aha. Check my track record in the past.
1108 2018-03-19 21:31:32 Last serious citywide effort I can recall to address the homeless problem came from Meg Salyer (ironically, herself responsible for increasing the number of homeless in Oklahoma during the 80's oil bust). I believe her preferred solution was to criminalize it. Genius.

1110 2018-03-19 21:31:27 After more than a decade of sanctions and two Gulf Wars, Iraq’s oil infrastructure needs modernization and investment.
1111 2018-03-19 21:31:26 1. never cross anything over a blade
2. remember kickback, make sure the guard is working, don't pinch the blade tip, stay away from rocks
3. chain oil
4. sharpen it
Chainsaws are very handy tools and you really just have to treat them with respect
1112 2018-03-19 21:31:22 When annibe send ziyatte for cannabis oil, does it seem bad for you?
1113 2018-03-19 21:31:13 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

1118 2018-03-19 21:30:44 Brookings: "Saddam Hussein’s regime was less than candid in its reports on oil reserve estimates—especially during the past 12 years, when Iraq’s oil fields were inaccessible to reputable Western companies." Despite the instability, Iraq ranks No. 1 in largest proven reserves.
1119 2018-03-19 21:30:42 Well so they say, it's not clear if they were just snake oil salesman. If anything good comes of this though it's more light been shone on facebook themselves, who are the real problem imo.
1120 2018-03-19 21:30:38 How about refocusing that oil money on renewable energy? That way we don't have to pretend smog is a #newfilter for the next generation.

1127 2018-03-19 21:30:16 Coastal erosion and letting oil companies build private canals explains most of it. Check similarly detailed maps from 20, 50, and 100 years ago to see the drastic changes
1128 2018-03-19 21:30:16 Whale oil was a genuine part of a car for quite some time. It was used in some vehicle transmission systems until 1973.

1134 2018-03-19 21:28:57 When the Iraqs were being pushed out of Kuwait they lit all the oil wells on fire on their retreat.   The Libs are lighting the treasury on fire on their retreat.
1135 2018-03-19 21:28:54 Chariot O&G Raise at 13pence was clever. Drill costs down from $80million to under $20million. 1/4 of 5 years ago so 3/4 less dilution for same drill. Ultimately #Char needs to find oil and the more drilling the better. Why get low balled when drilling is so cheap?? #Oil #AIM
1136 2018-03-19 21:28:51 Hey @Delta why would you wait until all of us boarded to determine there was an oil leak? Already delayed flight delayed even more for a plane change? C’mon DUDE!
1137 2018-03-19 21:28:18 Big data , big science  BIG BUSINESS. DATA is the new oil...now wonder even network providers keep sending us annoying ads (betting/gambling ads). Social media is inadvertently being used to undermine democracy GLOBALLY.

1146 2018-03-19 21:27:04 Hang in there Nancy we support you all the way.We need single payer and less of the pentagon and more green energy. All the heavy hitters want oil because they make a fortune off it. Wind and sun they cannot make a profit. This is the future and it will happen. we need congress

1149 2018-03-19 21:26:48 Really? News: California produces the most food (by value) in the United States followed by Iowa and Nebraska. We also have tech, industry, oil/gas - we're the 6th largest economy in the WORLD & we're a donor state. Middle America can't make it without us.
1150 2018-03-19 21:26:39 Furthermore, although one might be able to sell oil for USD and then use USD to purchase gold at a retail level, for a relatively small amount, try to do that trick for substantial quantities of gold and find out how well it works. Hint: it won't. It's effectively prohibited.
1151 2018-03-19 21:26:05 my goal for the rest of the year is to cook with less oil and use the microwave less.

1157 2018-03-19 21:25:06 One analyst from Ninepoint Partners, Eric Nuttall has said he has never seen a disconnect between oil and equities prices this wide in his whole career.

1161 2018-03-19 21:24:39 oil changes are fake. if you've ever paid to have your oil changed you've been scammed.
1162 2018-03-19 21:24:25 - Called the psychiatrist
- Applied at one Dr
- Got application for 2nd Dr which is accepting patients in April
- At vet w Jet

So far a successful day.

Now I have to
- Get a new chapstick
- Get my oil changed
- Remember to take my meds when u get home
1163 2018-03-19 21:24:23 I waited so long and was patient. Somehow they messed up my service ticket and I got a free (accidental) oil change and a voucher for a free tire rotation 
Patience pays off and God is good 
1164 2018-03-19 21:24:13 Right! And we’re more prone to melanoma! And you also still need to moisturize if you’re oily. Even if you’re oily when you don’t moisturize it confuses your skin and makes it produce even more oil to make up for it.
1165 2018-03-19 21:24:12 But what he's talking about has nothing to do with elections, their programs were funded by the Russian oil industry and were mostly ongoing energy related efforts, the Russians also financed the radical environmentalist groups that tried to shutdown US #fracking and pipelines
1166 2018-03-19 21:24:04 Of course you can. The question is: can you sell oil for RMB and buy gold with that RMB? And what will be the second- and third-order effects of being able to do so? You condescendingly refer to those discussing this as "fanatics," but you're the one not thinking it through.

They are on camera admitting to working with 3d party intelligence agencies to influence an election as well as entrapping elected officials. Their data program may be junk, but it doesn't mean it all is.

1175 2018-03-19 21:23:06 sometimes I make things out of wood for utility; sometimes I make things out of wood because I need about a cubic foot of sawdust a week to clean up the oil, gas, and ATF all leaking from separate places on the truck

Or they invent a crazy whisky tax fact,believe it for 3 years until they're told to never mention it again. 
1178 2018-03-19 21:22:54 any concerns on Oil holding up strong with markets selling off. Wti should've been down 3% + today

1180 2018-03-19 21:22:46 Of course the first time I get a legit cold in a while is during my spring break.  At least I have medicine, a heated mattress pad, tea, and an essential oil diffuser
1181 2018-03-19 21:22:39 I definitely hear what you are saying. Most these stocks have disconnected  from the oil price as much as 60%. All the negatives are magnified. No doubt they are undervalued considering that oil is still 60+. Can be a frustrating sector to be in at the moment, but it will pay off
1182 2018-03-19 21:22:38 Maybe I should go to Lucas Oil every day after work and I’ll just be like so productive. Except I don’t want to pay to have my oil changed each time.
1183 2018-03-19 21:22:37 In the 1970-72 negotiations to join the Common market, Brussels made noises about North Sea Oil being a Common Asset. Even Ted Heath wouldn't take that. An IS application would being that policy forward from the back burner.

1190 2018-03-19 21:21:34 Finally figured out how to empty the oil from the snow thrower. Had trouble figuring it out because where the manual says the oil drain is, is wrong. In both spots.
1191 2018-03-19 21:21:27 ...and 2nd hand Leafs etc getting cheaper all the time, and remember no oil changes, cam belts, exhausts, brakes, clutch, etc etc etc....oh and no road tax or fuel duty. Should be under 2p a mile all in. You pay more upfront but one hell of a lot less to run it.

1203 2018-03-19 21:20:17 I think deferring to the "private sector" for everything that someone else deems as "not a necessity" is reckless and an irresponsible expenditure of tax dollars.  Talk to Norway about it..... they have a state owned oil company, no debt, and a trillion in the bank.
1204 2018-03-19 21:19:53 You mean Chavez seized the oil industry and staffed it with incompetent loyalists. Your view that centralised control could lead to anything but totalitarianism and the torture of the masses is utterly blind to the realities of history and the present.

1216 2018-03-19 21:18:30 What strikes me, is that the gap between oil stocks and oil price is getting bigger by the day. I can understand, that they go with the market, but not why CRZO fell by 4.4% as oil was virtually unchanged.
1217 2018-03-19 21:18:18 Worthy of investigation. Activist resources being used to manipulate oil & gas market prices to profit through buying/selling? 
1218 2018-03-19 21:18:03 I’m sitting in Pep Boys right now waiting for an oil change and all I can think about is how personal I took it when they opened up in place of Nunleys. Was to young to even know what Pep boys was, but I knew I hated them with the burning passion of a 1000 suns.

1226 2018-03-19 21:17:22 The West doesn’t need to replace Putin but they do need to stop allowing criminal money flowing in, enforce extreme sanctions, stop oil deals, and make sure all oligarchs show the source of every dollar coming in.. stringent measures will weaken Putin’s hold and ability to move
1227 2018-03-19 21:17:17 Way way worse cos of the influx of expats working for big oil companies.
1228 2018-03-19 21:16:58 Makes oil and energy look clean. Says the oil and energy advisor....
1229 2018-03-19 21:16:56 Not when the olive oil is 3 WHAT. They can miss my 18billsespecially if it don’t eem work

1235 2018-03-19 21:15:42 His production is okay since he hits posts, crossbars, its like all the oil have had a strange yr like this. His play is much better than yr one. I watched alot of the Condors games when he was their and he was doing great, and next year will be his coming out time! IMO
1236 2018-03-19 21:15:41 Took a punt on some out of date Olbas oil and double dropped it with some Vicks for a steam bath. It burnt my eyes but I did give birth to an alien out of my nose.  Still feel rotten. Happy Monday y'all #BLB
1237 2018-03-19 21:15:35 It all depends on the boiling point...if its lower it's worse to fry in as it turns from a simple fat to a more complex fat and harder for our body to break down...ahahah that's my geek coming out from A-level chemistry....so i think rapeseed is good...olive oil not so much!
1238 2018-03-19 21:15:25 Do you prefer oil paint, acrylic paint or airbrush?
1239 2018-03-19 21:15:20 Crude oil is used to produce not only a range of fuels, but also petrochemical ingredients for plastics, inks, tires, pharmaceuticals, and a host of other products.
1240 2018-03-19 21:15:18 I tried to get cbd oil for my mother in law when she had pancreatic cancer. By the time all the paperwork and fingerprints were processed  for her medical marijuana card in Illinois she died.
1241 2018-03-19 21:15:11 I’m at Home Depot buying tools so I can change my own oil on my motorcycle and boy am I overwhelmed lmao
1242 2018-03-19 21:15:09 おはありです～！
1243 2018-03-19 21:15:01 @Jim_Jordan is a fast talking snake oil salesman.

1252 2018-03-19 21:14:15 any recommendations on where i should get my oil changed 
1253 2018-03-19 21:14:13 The University of Alberta did not have to support a province of 4 million people through a severe oil price recession while clawing out of an infrastructure deficit left by a past government ignoring its responsibilities. The NDP gov't did. Apples, oranges... 1/ #ableg
1254 2018-03-19 21:14:08 So an old rich white guy, a rich white woman that pretended to be a minority, and a fat rich white guy are gonna talk about how having money and being white are bad and should be stopped?

Makes perfect sense.
1255 2018-03-19 21:13:57 Just spent 475 new hub bearings oil and coolant change. I wasn’t even in the mood  the parts  it’ll be back x3 this week fuck it.
1256 2018-03-19 21:13:56 Appreciate. The bigger question is now if CA was working with Russian Oil Companies who were also involved in politics of Ukraine and money laundering through American Real Estate was Palantir and One of FB board members & how much pressure involvement did that board member have.
1257 2018-03-19 21:13:46 He told his friend he would be there that night and to clean up. His friend Moon came and got the cat. He left his hood up with oil on the roof so nobody would suspect anything when the car was there for a while. He planned the whole thing, and she was supposed to die with him.
1258 2018-03-19 21:13:35 a small suggestion for the anxiety mate
try legal cannabis oil , sell it on amazon and ebay
does not get ya stoned or nothing but chills you .

1261 2018-03-19 21:13:25 Nigga got all kinda pump it up and coconut oil on his face
1262 2018-03-19 21:13:22 Y yo sueño con que Charlize Theron me amarre a una cama de 4 postes y se embadurne de baby oil y me brinque encima, pero ninguna de las dos cosas va a pasar.
1263 2018-03-19 21:12:59 Coal is primarily made from decaying leaf litter accumulating over millions of years & oil mainly came from plankton, algae and other massively numerous microscopic sea life in ancient shallow sea beds dying, falling to the bottom, accumulating & decaying over millions of years
1264 2018-03-19 21:12:49 موفقين
1265 2018-03-19 21:12:42 Need to get an oil change this weekend.
1266 2018-03-19 21:12:42 Just had photo taken for new book hitting the shelves in September....Nice Mr Jim Tannock and Harry Broad had me and the old boy standing in grove and pouring oil ...
1267 2018-03-19 21:12:23 We've been frying in extra virgin olive oil for centuries in the Mediterranean, and our diet is know to be pretty healthy  #ethicalhour
1268 2018-03-19 21:12:23 Doesn't mean that at all. In fact, the oil theft means Britain is living on borrowed time, a bit like how Britain pillaged the world to build their #nhs at the huge human cost of foreign lives overseas @EmpireExposed
1269 2018-03-19 21:12:12 So it's ok for the Islamic Saudis to invest here because... oil? 9/11?  No seriosuly why?
Why MAGA why?
1270 2018-03-19 21:12:05 ...only for a status quo long past its sell-by date. Lets have a debate rather than an obtuse and obstructive government, blood on its hands, in thrall to Russian oligarchs and Saudi oil wealth.
1271 2018-03-19 21:11:54 I HATE SMOKING SHITTY OIL
1272 2018-03-19 21:11:39 That black castor oil really does wonders for a patchy beard
1273 2018-03-19 21:11:36 I have to edit: 

Our vodka and president are Russian.

Our oil is Saudi Arabian and American destroying our Native American Land.
1274 2018-03-19 21:11:32 Wow I put castor oil in my hair and my curls actually look like they are hydrated for once.
1275 2018-03-19 21:11:24 Np yw as I got older I started having dry patches I found that using a washing facial scrub then rinse and then moisturizer and after oil help for a better canvas for foundation
1276 2018-03-19 21:11:18 Grilled asparagus and mushrooms with olive oil?
1277 2018-03-19 21:11:12 Who is the big money behind the KM pipeline?  Texas oil interests.  Who is the big money in tar sands and LNG in Alberta?  Koch Brothers of Kansas. Yes, it is US money.
1278 2018-03-19 21:11:12 Marula oil.
1279 2018-03-19 21:11:10 Whale oil? Not cool bro.
1280 2018-03-19 21:10:53 .Hey Zac.  Appreciate your voice.  We could use it for the upcoming district 4 race for supervisor in AG/Nipomo.  Help us save the SLO coastline form oil drilling by endorsing Jimmy Paulding for Supervisor?
1281 2018-03-19 21:10:49 I have two paxes, the oil one is smaller and way more affordable! I've been curious about it, lmk more emi lol
1282 2018-03-19 21:10:30 Back in my side nigga days all I did was fuck and smoke, no taking her out to dinner, not changing her oil, those boyfriend duties

1285 2018-03-19 21:10:13 Waiting to get my oil changed for my car before I head to the gym
1286 2018-03-19 21:10:12 I always get my oil changed at the same jiffy lube mostly because of this one hot mechanic dad.
1287 2018-03-19 21:10:11 Learned my lesson twice sis. It may take a few weeks but after a good hot oil treatment your curls should be back to norm
1288 2018-03-19 21:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this March? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
1289 2018-03-19 21:10:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
1290 2018-03-19 21:09:40 And for perspective - because lots of people can’t see the big picture through these numbers - that’s OVER $7/gallon (imperial measure)
PS. The 1988 Canada-US “free trade” deal means Canadians pay world prices for our own oil, not cost of production. 
#cdnpoli
1291 2018-03-19 21:09:25 also condition the shit out of it and soak it overnight in coconut oil so it doesn’t break and die
1292 2018-03-19 21:09:23 yes, it'd be awful if the US started "literally" having wars for resources, for example, for oil...  #iliterallycanteven  Isn't it sickening how the horrors of government are always conveniently placed on the free market?
1293 2018-03-19 21:09:12 Not jobs that threaten their future, rather jobs that promote a sustainable future. Divestment of oil doesn’t mean we’ll stop using it tomorrow, but intensification is the wrong route. We either are concerned about their future or not. Actions and inaction will dictate our values
1294 2018-03-19 21:09:11 I'm on Facebook and I hate Facebook, but that's my dilemma. I hate that FB never stops trying to connect all of us like an overlord matchmaker. I hate that so many FB ads are scams and snake oil. Also, the drip of fake stuff I'm always debunking to my dumb friends.
1295 2018-03-19 21:09:08 Okay I’m tired! How do I make my struggle beard grow?  I mean without using beard oil....
1296 2018-03-19 21:09:08 I know may of you over the past few months have followed closely my quest for the perfect cooking oil, and I can happily announce my current favourite is Rice Bran Oil. Who knew?!
1297 2018-03-19 21:09:03 Shouldn't that read it's odd, when Oil has a good game.
1298 2018-03-19 21:08:55 #oil $oil $mur $djia
1299 2018-03-19 21:08:53 I dislike the spoon-fed TL I get with @Twitter. This isn't a free country, in case you were wondering. Corporations own the politicians and the CEOs are fascist by nature. Silicon Valley's been put in its place by the war profiteers who, after all, are world's biggest oil buyers.
1300 2018-03-19 21:08:50 That's terrific!! I remember when my mom did it like 25 years ago. She still draws, paints, watercolour & oil, charcoal, even ink.
1301 2018-03-19 21:08:32 Oil change and tire rotation type of day
1302 2018-03-19 21:08:27 Omg I use a beard wash and a hand crafted beard oil(wow this is the most hipster thing I’ve said today). I also condition it a few times a week
1303 2018-03-19 21:08:22 Gold, as sentiment indicator, fell aforehand. Then came up from test of 1308. US indices now behind. So, If gold presist up here in a soft test of 1325 again, US futts should follow. Notice oil didn’t take t plunge. Gold will though go opposite in a panic situastion. Was it?
1304 2018-03-19 21:08:13 They’re a fringe group that most people find disgusting in 2018
1305 2018-03-19 21:08:12 cursed smell: neem oil
1306 2018-03-19 21:08:11 No, I don't...  
But getting one shouldn't be a problem
1307 2018-03-19 21:08:00 Well, just like crude oil, the main value of #Data is in the refined information..
1308 2018-03-19 21:07:59 Once again I just want to apologize to all of those affected by oil spill that occurred 8 years ago next month. 

-TH
1309 2018-03-19 21:07:54 Seriously @JSTR_1 will you kindly massage my feet with oil and sprinkle turmeric powder on them too?
1310 2018-03-19 21:07:46 ok y’all i’m here 4 some guidance. best primers/setting sprays that control oil pls
1311 2018-03-19 21:07:40 It’s quite scary even listening to my peers who are older millennials. I literally had one the other day tell me that the kkk is a real danger. I was like dude the kkk has maybe 8k members and have no real power anymore.
1312 2018-03-19 21:07:37 Very good point!  the oil price needed to pay for imports key, also a good way to bring back in the FX rate -source + price of imports matter. Few countries are politically willing to contract imports like Venezuela. Watch how much imports rise with dev plans in GCC (esp KSA)
1313 2018-03-19 21:07:36 Perilla oil!
1314 2018-03-19 21:07:23 Des Rosneft fit in here somewhere? Russian oil ?  Blackmail and more?

1317 2018-03-19 21:07:16 I do! I have a huge ba. Of chamomile, some hibiscus... all that shit. I’m an oil infusing weirdo.

1319 2018-03-19 21:07:03 Today I oiled my scalp and oiled my hair in coconut oil , like stated in the #hairvibeschallange ! My hair feels very soft and smells great ! I won’t be taking pictures, but I did heat up the oil because it would be better to apply melted and I used my spray bottle! #naturalhair
1320 2018-03-19 21:06:58 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
1321 2018-03-19 21:06:45 You have a bicycle?
1322 2018-03-19 21:06:44 brushing castor oil on with a spoolie! not as extreme of a result as some serums, but a bit more natural and likely cheaper lmao
1323 2018-03-19 21:06:41 Try useing baby oil if u haven't next time guaranteed to work
1324 2018-03-19 21:06:26 @ThatDudeeRuddy Oh, wow! Well, if you ever need an oil change or other maintenance, keep us in mind? :)

1326 2018-03-19 21:06:25 Yes I know what you mean. I have been told its not great to heat rapeseed oil then someone else told me it was fine....  #EthicalHour
1327 2018-03-19 21:06:16 But Edmonton’s PP is terrible and many players have poor PP numbers. I don’t blame him for the Oil PP struggles

A little oil lamp said let's debate in the evening.
1329 2018-03-19 21:06:03 Why they have you schedule an appointment for an oil change and a hour later you’re still waiting on your car.
1330 2018-03-19 21:06:01 This poll chose to exclude the choice of polling for 100% renewable energy for both electricity and heating, which would have been more meaningful. It points to Sierra Club's ongoing problem in its relationship w/ O&G in the continued growth of fracked gas & oil especially in CO.
1331 2018-03-19 21:05:46 Try using baby oil if u haven't next time guaranteed to work
1332 2018-03-19 21:05:17 Something I am quite confused with is which oil can be heated and which one can’t. So many things to learn  #ethicalhour
1333 2018-03-19 21:05:16 These protesters want to hurt oil exploration companies by costing them money and intimidating there suppliers and workers. And Taylor knows exactly what has been done in the past.The court should uphold the injunction .

1339 2018-03-19 21:04:43 Hey now - Broward and Dade counties have their own special kind of stupid! Not the whole state now.       As I drive past the power pole shaped like Mickeys ears...
1340 2018-03-19 21:04:34 Its a poverty tax! Those of us who cant afford solar on our homes or an electric car. Im 100% for clean energy - but this is just pushing the numbers on everyday ppl and leaving the Gov to pump oil and rich bog corp to benefit while we get charged!

1342 2018-03-19 21:04:11 I've only been using this Jamaican Black Castor oil for a few days and i can see the difference 
1343 2018-03-19 21:04:06 Funny cuz the east & all the enviro nuts hate AB so they would be fine but AB is the one that mostly funds Eastern Cdn with equalization transfers so then they would feel it. Libs have put stricter controls on our oil than Saudi imports. Stupidity mindblowing
1344 2018-03-19 21:04:04 @stephenmusgrave do you know why Historic permits to remove old oil tanks take so long? Shouldn't this be automatic by now?
1345 2018-03-19 21:04:04 Just go for it dude!!
1346 2018-03-19 21:03:56 @Dodge has fucked me over 3 times now in attempts to fix a simple oil pan leak & I’m livid
1347 2018-03-19 21:03:30 Oil will end. 

Unless we have some way to make new sources appear in years instead of the millions of years it took to make in geological terms.

If we are talking post-oil organics, fine, or other tech solutions fine.

But oil will end.
1348 2018-03-19 21:03:20 Had a chap bought a petrol car from me 3 years ago despite doing 15k a year. Warned him, but insisted Bristol would penalise oil burners. 2 years later came back and bought a diesel. Explained EUR6 to him…

1358 2018-03-19 21:01:19 Why is this goal only for electricity, rather than heating too. It's fairly meaningless until you address the entire picture, as climate science indicates no new fossil fuel extraction and the immediate draw down of all fossil fuels, incl fracked gas & oil.

I was so wrapped up with orangutans and palm oil (don't get me wrong, still care massively) but it wasn't until I started looking closer to home that I realised how damaged the UK was and how blind I was to the massive decline in native species  #ConservationChatUk
1363 2018-03-19 21:00:53 It’s almost like you said “& so is the end of oil!” and he just pretended like you hadn’t said it…
1364 2018-03-19 21:00:42 เกลียดพวกนี้มาก ถังแตกไม่มีเงิน เสือกมาเก็บภาษีนั่นนี่ เมื่อไรแม่งจะออกไปให้หมดดลำคาญ ล่าสุดจะเก็บภาษีคนเลี้ยงหมาเลี้ยงแมวเอาเงินไปให้ควายแบบพวกมึงแดกหรอ
1365 2018-03-19 21:00:34 Currently smelling of deep heat, cough sweets and lavender oil..... form a orderly queue gents 
1366 2018-03-19 21:00:33 cafe: on offer: Scone, biscuit, tarts, crumbles, Slices, cream cake, Brownies, Pies, Sausage rolls, Quiche, Croissant, pizzas w oil cheese, Sandwiches, Savoury Tarts, Cakes, Ice creams, pastries, chips, battered fish, chicken nuggets, etc not much evidence for low fat there
1367 2018-03-19 21:00:31 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this March? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
1368 2018-03-19 21:00:27 ooh never tried it in cakes. How is the taste? We often pop in coconut oil. #ethicalhour
1369 2018-03-19 21:00:13 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1370 2018-03-19 21:00:08 March 19, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1371 2018-03-19 21:00:06 Seems like acceleration wasn't really a problem.

1376 2018-03-19 20:59:18 im bout to change sparkplugs and change oil on the whip fuck that choppin shit
1377 2018-03-19 20:59:14 But your good mate Arron Banks says not.  Trouble is, it is rather difficult to know who to trust isn’t it?  “What me, a snake oil salesman?”.  Anyway, your entire credibility is being flushed down the toilet right now.
1378 2018-03-19 20:59:07 Lol annnnnnd done
1379 2018-03-19 20:58:55 His son also got a nice oil deal in Ukraine right after the coup d'etat there. Seems to be a pattern he is not even trying to hide.
1380 2018-03-19 20:58:36 Tried to leave my baby with my gma so I can get my hubs an oil change & I drove all way down the street & drove my ass back to pick him up cause I couldn't leave him lmfao!!! I'm tripping
1381 2018-03-19 20:58:29 We need industries in delta not oil  let the government know retweet till they get this message.
1382 2018-03-19 20:58:16 Who's his media consultant? Joe Biden?
1383 2018-03-19 20:58:13 he certainly can memorize his lines well.
1384 2018-03-19 20:58:12 Have a read if oil pulling if you want to think about teeth brushing @reblev @zonca @abcbrisbane
1385 2018-03-19 20:58:05 Oil is for real #petro is fake money and money Laundry.
1386 2018-03-19 20:58:05 i just ate linguini and clam sauce i made last night and bbq ribs i baked at slow for 3 hours..... i feel asleep high thank god i smelled the burning off the aluminum foil oil....lol shit came out good anyway thogh smothered in bbqqqq sauce i dump vinegar on it
1387 2018-03-19 20:57:49 Rapeseed oil is yummy too #ethicalhour i use it in cakes instead of butter.
1388 2018-03-19 20:57:39 Will you massage my feet with oil, Yogi? Perhaps feed me grapes too?
1389 2018-03-19 20:57:33 I eat my dinner of dead animals
I fill my car with dead animals
I cover my skin with dead animals

And one of these days
I'm gonna be someone else's oil.
1390 2018-03-19 20:57:26 Our oil exports and imports are two different markets. If we stop exploration and exports it changes the dollar value for the economy. We would not have the export value to offset the cost of imports, like to fly aeroplanes for example.
1391 2018-03-19 20:57:16 needed better Brakeants??? or better Steeroids????
1392 2018-03-19 20:57:11 @DesThaKang Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
1393 2018-03-19 20:57:09 Why is the Oil Industry Summit being held in New Zealand? 
Is it because they take us all for fools - ready to do anything for money and have no scruples. 
This country used to be a leader and stand against wrong - now we're nothing but arse kissers.
1394 2018-03-19 20:56:57 It amazes me how well Young Living essential oil helps with runny nose, burns and bug bites.
1395 2018-03-19 20:56:41 I just got some so called organic peanut butter only to discover it was 10% palm oil and sugar. Even if the sugar and palm oil are organic, it is a gross violation to call it peanut butter. Organic peanut butter is just peanuts, nothing else. 
1396 2018-03-19 20:56:17 That idea is very sophisticated in a country where people usually just expect to be promised 2kg of rice and 750ml of cooking oil
1397 2018-03-19 20:56:03 Sadly the more I read about these, the more I believe them to be snake oil.

They make claims of equivalent purification to 275 trees, but trees act as a barrier to pollution rather than a sponge.

What is the equivalent number of household air purifiers to one of these?

1399 2018-03-19 20:55:56 Looks like coconut oil 
1400 2018-03-19 20:55:55 Main difference is the Earl Grey component - Jo's version is based on a lightly flavoured Darjeeling, the one in your blend is a tad maltier and stronger with more essential oil.
1401 2018-03-19 20:55:49 Oils even coconut/ olive oil, they oxidise rapidly.  Cook with cream butter and lard and you’ll live much longer!
1402 2018-03-19 20:55:42 GFI in Scottish its Go for it.
1403 2018-03-19 20:55:26  thighs with oil and towel p3 de3 hmmm
1404 2018-03-19 20:55:17 Water has become the new oil - only it is much more vital. We must not allow it to be squandered or stolen.
1405 2018-03-19 20:55:13 You are out of your damn mind. It did absolutely fucking nothing for Osama. It was Obama and his team that did that. Your Father legacy is tainted. He drove us to a needless war in Iraq for oil. He killed over 100,000 Iraqui Citizens and American Soldiers who didn’t have to die
1406 2018-03-19 20:55:12 this was made by official russian customs embargo on all milk products from EU-which made all cheese shortages, but KGB found a solution - Russia now is the largest importer of palm oil, it used to make cheese surrogates, so poor people are eating poison (palm oil is not edible)
1407 2018-03-19 20:55:09 It's also crazy to think about how long it took for those organisms to create the oil and natural gas!!!

1412 2018-03-19 20:54:57 They must be coming up with a way for big pharma to capitalize on cannabis and cbd oil.
1413 2018-03-19 20:54:54 No I don’t cuz I’m doing more important stuff and the way my life is gonna be set up looks like I’m gonna hire someone to do all that domestic stuff for me and future man lol. However the whole tweet is oil and water..

1415 2018-03-19 20:54:44 Forrest Gump 2: ( thread ) 

The year is 2023. There is one ruling party in America. Overfishing & oil spills have decimated the gulf shrimp population, ultimately destroying bubba gump shrimp co & devastating the local economy.
1416 2018-03-19 20:54:35 A strait-laced ex-army friend of ours who broke her neck whilst serving has been on 3 slow-release Tramadol per day for 5-6 years I think. Recently took plunge & tried some CBD oil from H&B. They called other day, now down to 2 tabs per day & gonna try drop another next week! :)
1417 2018-03-19 20:54:30 How about an ex oil tanker filled with soil and planted with trees and crops.
1418 2018-03-19 20:54:20 LOL!Its called common senseHe couldve just said its maybe soft but he went on talking bout the oil and vs rough hands, in a way hes even trynna justify. As a citizen with an IQ more than zero I can tell that's experience and guilt talking and not a guessed explaination. Grow up
1419 2018-03-19 20:54:16 TRY BLACK CASTOR OIL 

 Jamaican black castor oil is excellent for relieving a dry and itchy scalp during winter. Simply massage into scalp daily and it will even promote hair growth especially for those who may be experiencing hair loss
1420 2018-03-19 20:54:11 What, did they want it with a drizzle of olive oil during post to get that smokey finish?
1421 2018-03-19 20:54:04 Face routine:
Remove Makeup with Micellar Water and/or Removing Wipes
Exfoliate (1-2 times a week, never more)
Oil Based Cleanser
Water BasedCleanser
Toner
Eye Cream 
Serum
Moisturizer
Cream 
Face Mask (2-3 times a week)

More:
Staying hydrated
Sleep, including naps 
Relax time!
1422 2018-03-19 20:54:00 I think that's the oil pax right?
1423 2018-03-19 20:53:48 The world does not have a political system, it has an economy/ debt money system.

All debt-money economies are foundationally socialist = the many retire the obligations of the few.

Venezuela falls the same way Pemex fails = the oil industry is insolvent.
1424 2018-03-19 20:53:47 So this morning Maya and I came to the dealership to get an oil change. I had an appointment but I came a little early anyway. We got here at 10 am. I kept checking on the status of my car and finally around 1pm they pulled my car in.
1425 2018-03-19 20:53:41 @BaberSis        correcting my tweet! 

Love the hill country and the Lavendar Fields....just had a diffuser and some lavender essential oil delivered...
Need it to stay calm...in the environment of today’s world!

1427 2018-03-19 20:53:27 you're relying on data from an organisation whose board have vested interests oil  there is a shift in thinking around energy, move with it, oil is not sustainable or environmentally sound there are clean alternatives which must be explored fully and funded accordingly
1428 2018-03-19 20:53:08 Except the US has the strongest middle class in the world bar a few countries like Norway (oil) and Switzerland (more capitalistic than the US). And we do it with a deeply diverse population of 320 million people... pretty delusional stuff
1429 2018-03-19 20:53:08 LOC METHOD 

For moisture that will last all week, try the LOC method when styling your hair. The LOC method consists of a leave-in conditioner to hydrate, an oil to seal the moisture, and a cream to define. This set is a triple threat when it comes to combating winter dryness
1430 2018-03-19 20:53:04 Booby love, yo! Lotion bobs, oil bobs, paint bobs, glitter bobs,  wash bobs, repeat. 
1431 2018-03-19 20:52:54 So if Oil prices start falling, USD starts rising against EUR ?
Maybe.

If USD starts rising against Euro, Oil prices start falling ?
Maybe.
1432 2018-03-19 20:52:51 Kid is trying way too hard now. It is embarrassing.
1433 2018-03-19 20:52:45 I read a book called 'The Big Fat surprise' by Nina Teicholz it is a real eye opener about the food industry and western diets, For example olive oil was traditionally used to anoint, never for cooking, only the wars & lack of meat forced it on the diet.
1434 2018-03-19 20:52:33 Spiders hate Eucalyptus oil..try using it if there are no sensitivities..
1435 2018-03-19 20:52:31 It’s weird how the people who think they’re using “reason and logic” constantly repeat propaganda for oil companies and billionaires
1436 2018-03-19 20:52:28 I just realized that "Actively participate in turnaround executions" probably has a very different connotation for people who don't work in the oil and gas industry...
1437 2018-03-19 20:52:27 Like "oh here are some black truffle oil sprinkled hot dogs".
1438 2018-03-19 20:52:24 Yeah I did! ;) thanks!!!
It’s acrylic and oil pastel
1439 2018-03-19 20:52:16 It's looking good, though I'm waiting for the oil company's backlash.
1440 2018-03-19 20:51:53 I haven’t had garlic in my house in years. I may try garlic oil soon though.
1441 2018-03-19 20:51:46 I love lavender oil! I'm a jewelry designer and I use it every day in solders and pastes! I have to back off sometimes because I get too used to it's lovely fragrance but what a delight!
1442 2018-03-19 20:51:38 When you go to Jiffy Lube to get an oil change and they want to test all your signals and you don’t know how to turn on your lights because they are automatic, and you forget how to pop your hood, and you just flat embarrass yourself 
1443 2018-03-19 20:51:35 Tilapia Aquafeed are mostly made from ingredients such as soya bean, fish meal, palm oil, cassava flour with vitamin supplements.
Local farmers that can't afford commercial feed will rely on locally available plant protein sources that may include groundnut husk, wheat bran etc
1444 2018-03-19 20:51:33 I don't understand. Just as a ton of ginger, garlic, and chili oil, maybe some soy sauce, and you're good to go.
1445 2018-03-19 20:51:33 It really depends on the season and how well she moisturized w oil etc... there’s levels to this shit
1446 2018-03-19 20:51:33 Lack of oil in the Pleiades Nebula unfortunately
1447 2018-03-19 20:51:31 I am becoming seriously confused. You don't want oil, gas or hydro. Just what exactly are we supposed to use while we search for new green sources?
And don't tell me solar and wind power is ready to replace all other forms of energy.
1448 2018-03-19 20:51:26 Lol..
1449 2018-03-19 20:51:24 No, like the savory kind. People love to shove truffle oil into stuff and i hate it.
1450 2018-03-19 20:51:04 that's a rip off for the Scottish people considering they the English take the oil & gas revenue's & every thing else that they can get there grubby hands on
1451 2018-03-19 20:50:56 Probably secret stockpiling for the coming zombie apocalypse. Federal Building makes perfect sense for this. Is there an oil and vinegar display down a different hallway?
1452 2018-03-19 20:50:54 she's trying to temp me by rubbing breast and legs in olive oil. She's doing roast duck now 
1453 2018-03-19 20:50:49 Peppermint oil is wonderful but be careful with it because it can cause your uterus to contract! I used it though when I was pregnant and would smell it or rub it on the bottom of my feet!
1454 2018-03-19 20:50:45 the #deepstate dont control Putin. no #illumiminat control in Russia since the Romanovs were ousted in the Revolution. this is why the #deepstate reduced the oil price to starve him of cash. Putin is the best chance the world has right now cos he isnt controlled
1455 2018-03-19 20:50:38 It's really less about that and more about the fact that the petro challenges the US Dollar's dominance over the crude oil market. I whole heatedly believe that's why we see this happening
1456 2018-03-19 20:50:37 Can't support someone who wants to continue to spend taxpayer dollars fighting a plant. CBD oil is only part of what marijuana has to offer. I appreciate the bipartisan reach by @ClayTippins, but his "slippery slope" comment on his page makes him look foolish.
1457 2018-03-19 20:50:31 Baby oil party all day!!!
1458 2018-03-19 20:50:27 thank you @CatOilandGas for the follow!

1460 2018-03-19 20:50:15 Bet Arnold doesn't know that plastics come from oil.
1461 2018-03-19 20:50:12 Yes snake oil salesman.
1462 2018-03-19 20:50:10 i gots to get my oil change n car wash n a haircut. i’ll be a new bitch after 7pm today.
1463 2018-03-19 20:50:00 I have a question: if these people are so dead set against oil/pipelines etc, why have they done nothing for the 60 years the existing line has been in place?

Attention whores!
1464 2018-03-19 20:49:51 The molecular structure of plant based oil changes when heated and can be toxic. Animal fats have been used for centuries, but were outlawed in the 1950's since then folks have got fatter & unhealthy eating a low fat diet
1465 2018-03-19 20:49:42 Oil exploration is very detrimental to our natural environment/wild-life. 
Amazing how wealthy/greedy aren't prepared to give up their fancy lifestyles for the future of humanity. 
It seems the less you have to lose, the more you are prepared to lose it for the good of the planet
1466 2018-03-19 20:49:40 With a little superior olive oil and Herbamare, it’s ok!
1467 2018-03-19 20:49:40 An all women’s shop got me in and out for an oil change in 20 minutes  and taught me how to change me cabin air filter, cause I only knew how to get to the one under the hood

1472 2018-03-19 20:48:29 Why did I decide to wait for my oil change to be done been here for an hour and half now
1473 2018-03-19 20:48:24 Just way too much deep fried food in one sitting. My digestive system can't handle that much oil anymore.

But it was SO GOOD! I couldn't help myself!

1475 2018-03-19 20:48:01 If they would allow research on Cannabis, they would find very beneficial pain relievers within that are natural and non-addictive. Just like Big Oil, Big Drug doesn't want the American people to have it. We need to allow this vital research, Cannabis is historically sensible.

1501 2018-03-19 20:45:24 Yes you are right...but dubai is a city of 2.5mil people(per c 32.2) while Nigeria is country of 195mil ppl(per c 2.1) ..dubai has a gdp of 82bil while nig has 400 bil... besides oil is not the main source of income in dubai.............

1505 2018-03-19 20:44:57 I’ve been trying to find a method to get this endometriosis under control. I’ve opted for trying CBD oil and it has helped immensely. This the only time you will ever see me with a vape.

1507 2018-03-19 20:44:34 Dips are great. Just need crock pot. You can roast carrots onions potatoes and other root veggies lil oil and garlic. Some gets charred some not all delicious
1508 2018-03-19 20:44:28 Lol I would push my cuticles back a lot and oil my cuticles and they grow and I go to the nail salon to get an acrylic overlay no extra nails just the overlay cause it keeps the nail hard so it won’t break and your own nail won’t break when the overlay is taken off
1509 2018-03-19 20:44:28 He hasn't faced any obstacles. He's been coddled and promoted every step of the way, no matter how bigoted the words out of his mouth are.

Just like he's probably been his entire life.
1510 2018-03-19 20:44:27 Speaking of questions and answers when is Andy Scheer going to answer for his ridiculous trip to England which accomplished exactly nothing? Or ante up to who his private donors are (oil industry fossils and religiously insane Fundies) ?? #cdnpoli
1511 2018-03-19 20:44:20 It's 4:45. I have dumped half a bottle of oil on the counter, broken the chick's heat lamp, broken the dishwasher, and my kid has a giant bruise/scrape on her nose (she has inherited my clumsiness). I'd like this day to be over now.
1512 2018-03-19 20:44:19 I bought CBD oil in Holland and Barrett at the weekend, will be interesting to see if it works. I've had next to 0 success with non-pharmaceuticals so I'm obvs a total sucker.
1513 2018-03-19 20:44:02 I know.I honestly thought it was an oil painting at first 
1514 2018-03-19 20:43:34 I have cleared 3 hectares of land at oloko kwara , I want to plant moringa trees and sell seed and extract oil to sell. #myinvestmentplan
1515 2018-03-19 20:43:34 This isn’t expansion, this oil, whether it goes here or there is still going to flow. If KM gets stopped that oil will still go somewhere via existing lines or rail. The difference is we lose billions in revenue, money that goes to all these social services we all like.
1516 2018-03-19 20:43:20 I'm no fan of either of you but with this comment, he really hasn't done anything wrong he watched your video and was going to donate to charity I understand that oil whites merch is shit but you've taken this way to far

1521 2018-03-19 20:43:00 Great #IIFG20 meetings and seeing the ARG gov’ putting infrastructure first for the G20. Oil prices are the global economy’s thermometer: looking good, but need more long-term policy solutions. Repair the roof while the sun is shining!

1524 2018-03-19 20:42:45 Oh no! The fish was perfectly fine! It was eating FOUR PIECES of deep fried fish along with a DOUBLE HELPING of deep fried fries that did me in! My liver and gall bladder are no longer equipped to handle that much oil in one sitting! 
1525 2018-03-19 20:42:36 Where are the Las Vegas survivors?
1526 2018-03-19 20:42:35 I use it 2 times a week cause it’s a lil strong. Eg,whenever I have a lil pimple I apply some a bit of the oil overnight and it literally disappears.

They woke up this morning to find out she lied to them.

1531 2018-03-19 20:42:08 Why. You believe Trump. He is worst president in the world. Peoples Are dying in the midel east because of usa,rusia, europe,israel. They want just middle east oil. They dont care about human die.
1532 2018-03-19 20:42:01 Came to get an oil change and the dude who pulled up my car probably thought like damn it smells like dank 
1533 2018-03-19 20:41:58 and trump is removing safety regulations from many, if not all projects (ocean oil platrorms, fracking, coal mines etc etc etc)!   we will see more disasters and deaths with less regulations.
1534 2018-03-19 20:41:57 Had to get my new baby an oil change
1535 2018-03-19 20:41:38 Just as cole mining and working on offshore oil riggs. Its a bloody shame.

Keep the phone OUT OF THE POOL! 

Wash your hair with regular shampoo to get the chlorine out! Deep Condition! Seal in the moisture with oil (while still wet of course). Use a good leave-in conditioner! Don't steal my ish! Style as usual.

1540 2018-03-19 20:40:42 5) Olive oil

Olive oil is good for eyelashes because this allows them to become stronger and moisturised. Use a clean mascara wand and apply directly to the lashes only using a small amount
1541 2018-03-19 20:40:41 Baby said you got your oil changed and hauled ass on me

1544 2018-03-19 20:40:27 @GeorgeFreemanMP Are you aware of the inability of local heating oil suppliers to meet customers needs? A few days with difficult driving conditions and we now have to wait +/- a month for oil! #Unacceptable. (Like Broadband and mobile signal). Please address the issue.
1545 2018-03-19 20:40:26 But i read somewhere that the oil is not to be directly applied rather it be diluted.
1546 2018-03-19 20:40:23 You can beat a good old ballon release after talking about the plastic problem on the environment what’s planned for tomorrow a debate on marine life then a tip a barrel of oil into the sea ?? #TheOneShow

1551 2018-03-19 20:39:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
1552 2018-03-19 20:39:36 In France, I saw an ad campaign trying to rehabilitate palm oil. So confusing for the consumers! Personally, I don’t like to stop completely one ingredient and I do my best to check the composition to vary a lot. That is such a time-consuming job! #ethicalhour
1553 2018-03-19 20:39:32 Be there, in your swim wear.  I used baby oil that summer to lay out with and got super dark. Need to do the Sames this year
1554 2018-03-19 20:39:13 This oil is fuegooooo
1555 2018-03-19 20:39:05 Yep, if #NZ stops drilling for oil can companies stop drilling for our water? 
1556 2018-03-19 20:39:04 Nick’s mom got me nail oil pens for my birthday and I’m so pumped about it
1557 2018-03-19 20:38:57 Well done Jo. I'll try even coverage of oil & butter for my 3rd attempt. 1st attempt - soggy pancakes; 2nd attempt burnt pancakes. But I still ate both the soggy & burnt pancakes. Nothing like home cooking.

1560 2018-03-19 20:38:52 ooh I could never  coconut oil clogs my pores so bad
1561 2018-03-19 20:38:47 Gross.  @tedcruz has a long history of posting porn.  But now we gotta see his violent homoerotic fantasies?  Spandex and oil and trumps slippery blubber?
1562 2018-03-19 20:38:37 Tried out some new kind of tofu tonight and it really didn't behave like tofu at all. It tasted like fish but the only things it was made of were soy, oil and calcium..
1563 2018-03-19 20:38:35 Just saying you reached the east side of DeZ city in about a week to prevent SAA expanding.. You went through 100km in ISIS territory without spending a bullet... Then digged in oil fields. Moved again to race for Abu Kamal (you lost that one)
1564 2018-03-19 20:38:22 Sadly, he doesn’t care. Big oil wants to drill. Obama protected the land. Ergo trump killed the regs that will destroy the land
1565 2018-03-19 20:38:19 *kids hospitalized for something other than gun-shot wounds*

Some folks: *eye roll* "and people think guns are the issue..."

That's like saying, "and people think sharks are the issue," when fish die from an oil spill.

Guns aren't the only factor, but changes need to be made.
1566 2018-03-19 20:38:15 currencies, bonds and oil. Werent indicating market weakness. Why i went very long QQQ
1567 2018-03-19 20:38:09 An whole hour waiting for a oil change  to tell me you didn't touch my car yet and I have to wait another half hour . I'm not coming back to pep boys
1568 2018-03-19 20:38:02 hello from a craft salesperson. oil based paint markers or leather paint would work. seal with leather lacker or just let it be without sealing. now go make that akashi-case u weebie.

1580 2018-03-19 20:36:34 Of course it's interesting to here the ATA spout forth the benefits of ethical oil (Ezra's rant) finally.

1582 2018-03-19 20:36:33 They are obviously controlled/intimidated by threats of law-suits, scandals, financial ruin and worse.  IMO we spent far too much money on foreign oil and now they are spending it.
1583 2018-03-19 20:36:32 It’s really big! About 180 million+ of people. I mean they better change their mind though. The country relies so much on oil for their source of revenues, and the oil prices haven’t been great either 
1584 2018-03-19 20:36:26 I’ve been using the face wash, toner, matifying lotion and oil for a year now. I stopped using the toner and switched to Nature’s Nourishment Rose water. Started using the mask yesterday. Apply a few drops of the oil to affected area.(I only use it at night)

1587 2018-03-19 20:36:18 not "bread lines" LOL, every citizen of Rome was entitled to food, that's what most Roman expansion was about, they would gloat over bringing back to Rome "Olive oil, grain, cattle and sheep" 
not that we don't loot other countries too, it's just we don't feed our people with it
1588 2018-03-19 20:36:10 Sounds like the future may be turning oil pipelines into water pipelines.
1589 2018-03-19 20:36:05 Northwestern paused. They need a seal and DTE light. They will get oil I have seal.
1590 2018-03-19 20:36:02 Lets sell our oil reserves now so these guys will have our children “over a barrel” later! Whoohoo!
1591 2018-03-19 20:35:56 3) Coconut oil

Coconut oil is also beneficial for hair growth because this stimulates the hair and causes it to thicken and darken!

1599 2018-03-19 20:35:25 Another factor is that self driving cars mean a lot less people will own cars. If you can just press a button on your phone and a car pulls up in 5 minutes, that's convenient enough. However, less cars mean car and oil companies get screwed. Thats some counter pressure.
1600 2018-03-19 20:35:14 Yes they obviously care too much their hearts Aren't Dead Like Yours more oil or bitumen more better
1601 2018-03-19 20:34:56 You are ignoring that what will be transported is dilbit, not oil. You are also ignoring the effect of expanded tarsands on our climate goals.

1615 2018-03-19 20:33:26 2) Castor oil

Castor oil is great for hair growth
Use a clean mascara brush and apply to your eyelashes before bed! Do not use too much as this will cause build up and make sure to wash off in the morning
1616 2018-03-19 20:33:02 Try coconut oil
1617 2018-03-19 20:32:45 I prefer “on broccoli” or “on flaxseed oil.”
1618 2018-03-19 20:32:40 Try CBD oil. Less paranoia.
1619 2018-03-19 20:32:37 A perfect example of why socialists have no clue how an economy works .you cannot just print money when ever you need it this causes inflation and destroys the buying power of the currency.also the currency is tied to oil this is what helps gives it value.

1627 2018-03-19 20:31:15 Do you realize how long it takes for a tax cuts to become a job, if ever? I don't know which car manufacturer you mean, but if they decided last year to move jobs, they still need to create infrastructure for those jobs. So they wouldn't be counted. What do you mean by #1 in oil?
1628 2018-03-19 20:31:04 I NEED oil to roll over. Making money everywhere else.
1629 2018-03-19 20:31:04 Is that sarcasm I detect? Or is that you just being your regular "special" self ? Do you have a point or just enjoy attempting to insult others who are seeking out an alternative to oil dependency?
1630 2018-03-19 20:30:45 Lol, Na self triggered oh. I even want to soak it in anointing oil. 
1631 2018-03-19 20:30:44 I’ve realized with my hair it take drowning it in oil for 1 hour rinsing with warm water and then putting it in a protective style!

Please give me money!

1640 2018-03-19 20:29:24 I always spray some setting spray on whichever palette thing I’m about to use because it helps to apply more smoothly, that or some oil should help with application and blending!
1641 2018-03-19 20:29:24 I do wonder about that - who is the independent body verifying palm oil is sourced sustainably?  #EthicalHour
1642 2018-03-19 20:29:22 Yea. But I've told you it wasn't creamy anymore bc its oil leaked
1643 2018-03-19 20:29:22 They aren’t talking about pure oil.
1644 2018-03-19 20:29:13 I remember the first gulf war when people were screaming for war just because the guys at the top finally decided the oil belonging to one dictatorship was being threatened by another dictatorship

 "..men who are regarded as incompetent, callow, senile, or racist sail back into office, and are even canonized as heroic figures once they retreat into the postpresidential sunset, clearing brush or painting oil portraits."

1649 2018-03-19 20:28:41 Why? Oil prices up?
1650 2018-03-19 20:28:23 Y’all ever walk by a colleague’s desk and see the oddest shit? Why do they have a bottle of olive oil on their shelf? Why does it look like they keep all of their shoes under their desk? Is that a real bone?
1651 2018-03-19 20:28:16 Palm oil - how to stay away from it? And how to know if "sustainably sourced" really is, or if it's just another case of greenwashing? It's in EVERYTHING and it's production creates such destruction. #EthicalHour #palmoil #sustainable @EthicalHour

1689 2018-03-19 20:24:12 It’s a lil pricey but the Clinique take off the day balm is great and I also use micellar water after to take off the oil residue from the clinique balm. It’s truly worth EVERY penny.
1690 2018-03-19 20:24:10 This study doesn’t take into account how those economic measures implemented by Chavez ended up destroying the economy on the long run. Over regulation, corruption and making us solely reliant on oil brought us to this. You are defending the indefensible

1695 2018-03-19 20:23:53 OK GDP= $190 Billion
Oil/Gas = $65 Billion (37 output, rest in employment)
Total Tax Receipts= $9 billion
Taxes on Oil/Gas = $2.5B(only 400m in production taxes)

Oil/Gas pays 80% of taxes like all other businesses. The "production tax" is tiny and is not the cause of high taxes

1763 2018-03-19 20:15:29 So what you’re recognising is that that the discovery and use of  oil did more to save the whales than anything else. Well done you.
1764 2018-03-19 20:15:25 Disgusting ppl.  Being duped...by American interests. Being paid by American oil companies to protest the somerhing tbat wpuld benefit us all here in Canada.  Shame on the lot of you.
1765 2018-03-19 20:15:16 Can you give me a link to the CAG report? The production costs of deep sea wells was north of six dollars around the world when Reliance reduced production. Also drilling was expensive as oil and gas prices were very high during those days and there was a lot of drilling going on
1766 2018-03-19 20:15:05 so I saw Iran dropped the dollar let's drop all trade with them and work mass production of biofuel and bio conversion kit for any and all cars on the states so any oil from the middle East they can learn to drink that shit so we don't have to buy it.

1772 2018-03-19 20:14:04 I think ethically can be a bit trickier....the labels aren't so easy to identify whats ethical/what's not especially when there is palm oil involved! But now you can get apps that scan it and help you to identify the good brands

The Bush's war with Saddam Hussein is just one example of Repub propaganda too.  However they can get hold of oil.
1775 2018-03-19 20:13:57 that would ultimately be a much more bearish setup for oil. But not my view
1776 2018-03-19 20:13:52 From the Financial Times: Despite the global focus on reducing carbon emissions, the fact is that the world will still need some 100m barrels of oil a day for many years to come.

1784 2018-03-19 20:12:39 At the mo it's just over half of what it was then.. I suppose it's all about how one defines the term 'collapsed?

However the substantive point, made in 2014 ,when The voice of Russia was pushing $113pb rising to $120 &&*maybe even $200*...  was that oil was too volatile

It take a second to work in, but leaves your hands smooth and not sticky.
1789 2018-03-19 20:12:10 CA taught us that 1. A twatty Etonian can still sell snake oil 2. AI is worth shit electorally and 3. Hookers and blackmail always works
1790 2018-03-19 20:12:02 "Effect of oil spillage on soil and ground water " Man I worked hard on that. Tope even had a crazier time with Prof Odigi.  Drunkard like that
1791 2018-03-19 20:11:47 Aaand he looks like a snake oil salesman too...
1792 2018-03-19 20:11:36 So are you suggesting that our relaince on foreign oil is Trudeau's doing?
1793 2018-03-19 20:11:29 The Avocado Face Oil has avocado, squalane and sunflower plus essential oils which are good for dry skin. The oil helps to protect dry skin from damage while replenishing it with the fatty acids it needs.
1794 2018-03-19 20:11:21 Or go to Lucas Oil Raceway (IRP back then)
1795 2018-03-19 20:11:15 We love the oil too! Thanks for sharing, shoot us an email at dibellasmarketing@dibellas.com so we can get you some swag!
1796 2018-03-19 20:10:53 I hate that my car tells me to change my oil every time I turn it on. Like goddamn car, I’ll get to it in like 2 months
1797 2018-03-19 20:10:28 Its pretty tasty. I think the pasta is a little dry though so next time I’ll use a little more olive oil.

1802 2018-03-19 20:09:56 I love the way guys follow pages like @SI_Swimsuit, you gawk at the photos and make negative comments. Lads you ain't exactly oil painting's. I wouldn't throw too many comments on how women look. Everyone has their opinion and if you don't like what you see then scroll on. 
1803 2018-03-19 20:09:51 Happy to read that your good organization Aramco will only list on the Saudi stock exchange; I'm confident international traders prefer this.

Aramco stock is my #1 choice to trade oil prices.

Excited!
1804 2018-03-19 20:09:34 I hope you didn’t promote pipeline investments. We don’t want intensification. We want leadership in divesting in our oil dependency’s. Our children’s future is too important to ignore.
1805 2018-03-19 20:09:17 Most E&P companies cannot grow within cash flow therefore they are faced with higher leverage or dilution at some point in the future without even higher oil prices. This doesn't apply to the best companies,  it does trade at valuations that don't make sense to me.
1806 2018-03-19 20:09:16 Hi all, we're olive farmers, & land activists, making beautuful olive oil in Crete, selling in UK. Direct trade = fair trade! Think our labels are pretty clear #ethicalhour
1807 2018-03-19 20:09:11 But how many of those people (including me) think the deep state is made up of Republicans, Russia, and Wall Street and the oil industry? Fronted by Fox News.
1808 2018-03-19 20:09:10 seriously :^O
1809 2018-03-19 20:09:10 More absolute rubbish. Britain is at far greater risk by their illegal wars for oil and geopolitical control
1810 2018-03-19 20:09:09 In 1973 the pound was nose diving and oil revenues did not really make any substantive difference until the early 80s.

1812 2018-03-19 20:08:51 So is alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. Marijuana itself is not dangerous. It's when you alter its natural state i.e. dabs, edibles, wax and oil. The stronger they make it the more dangerous it becomes. So I can agree with you to a certain degree.
1813 2018-03-19 20:08:49 Absolutely - our Mandarin Cleansing Oil is a gentle and soothing cleanser that doesn’t strip away the skin’s natural moisture which is great for dry skin. We also have an Avocado Face Oil being released soon which is for dry/ sensitive skin

1815 2018-03-19 20:08:42 Alberta is tanking because bitumen is very difficult and expensive. Oil really can function at $80 a barrel. American shale can function at much lower levels. Of course there are anti fracking movements.
1816 2018-03-19 20:08:39 THOSE ARE ERIN'S CURTAINS, IF THEY WERE MY CURTAINS THEY WOULD BE BEAR PELTS DRIPPING IN MOTOR OIL. RIGHT @RustOwl ?
1817 2018-03-19 20:08:18 You wouldn't believe what washes ashore form oil platforms
1818 2018-03-19 20:08:17 ya, but that doesn’t mean they are any better than a successful snake oil salesman.
1819 2018-03-19 20:08:16 If there was no oil, would there be a "Kurdish problem", I dont think so. Am I correct?

1829 2018-03-19 20:07:22 Essential oils are not the answer to every damn problem. 
Anxiety meds are sometimes needed. Lavendar essential oil isnt going to cure actual mental disorders. Its a chemical imalance.... I fail to see how sniffing lavendar will fix that.

1852 2018-03-19 20:04:11 To be very clear, average price per barrel of oil during the N87 era was $90. Since the N145 era, the average price is approximately $50. So basically Nigerians bought fuel at a cheaper price when oil was more costly. The only explanation is massive corruption & ineptitude!

Then the first thing they did was secure the oil fields which Saddam had wisely set ablaze. Turns out VP Cheney's Halliburton was given no-bid contracts to work Iraq.

1864 2018-03-19 20:01:55 Just oil is about 100 million barrels a day when you consider the inefficiencies of extraction (when you "frac" a geological shale deposit you don't recover 100% of the available oil); that translates to ~ 4 billion gallons of portable fuel a day... #TheHydrogenSolution

1938 2018-03-19 19:54:14 Over 750 BC business supply the oil industry. The oil sands alone pay approx $23B per year in federal taxes (which we all spend). The largest supplier of labour from outside of AB is from BC. This will help reduce our discount which in turn helps B.C. generate my royalties...

Were they repairing something, or planting/building something?

1963 2018-03-19 19:51:21 I stopped to watch a bunch of people eating during lunch. All the business-attire people are having such serious conversations. There’s a table of people who work at a nearby game company. They’re all smiling and laughing.

1981 2018-03-19 19:49:14 Industries focusing on mineral resources like tin, gold, steel and aluminium especial the Ikot abasi aluminium smelter, refineries should start refining. How come the militants refine the oil locally why can’t we modernise their methods.......
1982 2018-03-19 19:49:13 taking a survey for jiffy lube after an oil change and they're asking me which is more important, trustworthy employees or quality of work? and like it should be PRETTY OBVIOUS that both of those need to be high

1997 2018-03-19 19:47:10 Esthetician here. You still need moisturizer if you’re oily. Oil doesn’t give your skin moisture.
1998 2018-03-19 19:47:05 This is the most pointless story I've read in a while. The WH Press Sex called it "Operation Iraqi Liberation" 2x, or else Jay has no joke.

2067 2018-03-19 19:40:03 this isn't what I'm talking about. Yeah, there was a point where America played Iraq against Iran. Then a point where due to oil concerns the G.H.W. Bush admin went to war against Iraq. It's AFTER that the Democrats conceived of the WMD lie while in power
2068 2018-03-19 19:39:59 Do you think that if I swallow oil painting I’ll ***
2069 2018-03-19 19:39:58 Its okay Israel armed us to fight and bought oil from the wedge.... We have a head knod with Austria???? All the while fighting with indians
2070 2018-03-19 19:39:43 Yeah, and I have an argan oil hair gel that my hair LOVES, so... xD I liked how long the Amplified I got like 5 years ago lasted in my hair but it's just not as cheap an option as this sale, lol.
2071 2018-03-19 19:39:32 hehehehe, should not America warn itself against looting Syrian oil.
2072 2018-03-19 19:39:31 If people can put fucking broccoli on pizza then pineapple 9000% belongs!!! 
FIGHT ME! 
But also.... having pineapple and feta on pizza with a garlic oil base instead of tomato sauce will change your damn life!
2073 2018-03-19 19:39:22 usine oil based cleansers and moisturizers! it seems counterintuitive but using oils actually kinda “trains” the skin to jot produce as much!
2074 2018-03-19 19:39:16 The government takes eminent domain for oil pipelines. It's a devastating threat to Midwest landowners @BoldNebraska, Native Americans, us all.  It runs highways & people lose homes. Guns don't protect citizens' rights from government. They don't serve the purpose the NRA claims.
2075 2018-03-19 19:39:10 Not my finest moment in the kitchen tonight - I spilled hot oil all over the floor then set the oven glove on fire... 
2076 2018-03-19 19:39:07 I can't wait to get my birthday presents I ordered the oil lip colours,the highlighter trio and eye brow duo xx
2077 2018-03-19 19:39:06 The difference is that Norway govt considers resources to belong to the country - its people. PC party in AB (& Harper) consider oil as an asset for multinational companies & used royalties to provide corp tax cuts where Norway saved $ for its people. @CFIB fail, Tufts! #cdnpoli

2081 2018-03-19 19:38:46 To earn credits under the #LowCarbon Fuel Standard system, companies can also take part in a range of R&D, service programs under gov agreements. Clever example: @BCScrapIt incentive for BC citizens to replace ICE with EV in a program funded by an oil company for credits.
2082 2018-03-19 19:38:22 OH MY HEART 

so i’m at the auto shop getting my oil changed and this white man in a suit comes into the atrium area 

this precious little black boy, maybe 6 or 7 years old, comes up to him. “are you the boss?” 

“yes i am.  but you are going to be a boss too someday!”
2083 2018-03-19 19:38:08 The same argument can be made for any other commodity to be a currency. A barrel of oil, at some level, can also function in those three capacities as well. But we don’t typically use it for that. Why? More efficacious alternatives.
2084 2018-03-19 19:38:06 I took my foot out of my shoe at work to warm my toes & Jim said you’ve got really nice feet for a man, I bet you want to rub oil into them I replied!

He looked lost for words & so did the customer watching

2087 2018-03-19 19:37:55 I often say that oil is the jizz of Satan, and am very fond of this figure of speech. 

Cambridge Analytica is Satan's ballsack sweat.

2091 2018-03-19 19:37:27 I haven’t, actually. But i can imagine it wouldn’t be too harsh on your hair because of the argan oil. Ive only used redken and the color brilliance though. Once I find something I like, I don’t budge 
2092 2018-03-19 19:37:23 Has anyone done any research into whether all this psychographic profiling actually works or are we dealing with a bunch of snake oil salesmen with Trump as their biggest rube?

2103 2018-03-19 19:36:01 What is in the anointing oil?
1)The oil carries the spirit of God. Acts 10:38 
2)The anointing is the breakthrough power of God.
Joel 2:23 
Isaiah 6:7
3)The protective Power of God. Psalms 105:15

2104 2018-03-19 19:35:42 Petro cannot be buyed by all people, cannot be buyed by people with less than 18-21 years old, maybe even more, not like other cryptocurrencies, i dont even consider  Petro a cryptocurrenciy, is more like a title of ownership of goods, oil..., not a currency.

2108 2018-03-19 19:35:24 If we're going by how their economy functions then they're still capitalist with the exception of some key industries (eg. oil). If we're going by government spending as percent of GDP then they're less socialist than we are.
2109 2018-03-19 19:35:11 Ran out of oil. But it wasn't due for a change in over 200 miles and it has only been a few months. And the oil light never came on as a warning. Apparently 2012 Subarus are notorious of oil guzzling and I was unawares.

2124 2018-03-19 19:33:08 #Venezuela has the largest oil reserves on the planet. But it’s not economic unless the price per barrel goes above ~$72. Which it will. In about 20 years it will be the most valuable asset on the planet. That’s why you are so invested in imposing crony capitalism on Venezuela.
2125 2018-03-19 19:32:53 a lot of them have coconut oil or coconut derived ingredients in them and i’m allergic so i can’t wear it

Which is why Jesus dies after the 5th wound on the cross. The oil then goes the hypothalamus gland where it’s sits for 2 1/2 days.

2136 2018-03-19 19:31:01 I would laugh if you're sincerity wasn't real. The USA media by no means projects renewables as the only solution. Media is PR and coal and crude oil run their campaigns.
Dichotomizing nuclear vs. coal is also antiquated. 
We currently rely on a fossil fuel baseload because
2137 2018-03-19 19:30:44 But let me ask you why the US forces launched a war on Iraq and killed many innocent citizens !!? Tell me why !! Is it for oil !!?

It is insulting - and condescending.
2152 2018-03-19 19:29:19 @HondaCanada when are you going to have a fix for the gas in the oil issue? What will you do for your customers to ensure their vehicle is not adversely affected?
2153 2018-03-19 19:29:13 No support for a scam.
We live in a large country, it takes alot of energy to transport goods east, west and far north. That doesn't happen without oil. We heat our homes at least 6mths a year. Why penalize our citizens for living in a large northern country?

2205 2018-03-19 19:19:38 Coincidencia es la hija del ministro que firmó el convenio con la empresa Gente Oil, coincidencia ???
2206 2018-03-19 19:18:59 Exactly. I used a vitamin e oil as a primer when I first started doing makeup a few years back, & it's completely calmed the skin down. Made my skin so much more balanced. I could use any foundation or product simply off preference.
2207 2018-03-19 19:18:58 Afraid not. The big (Oil) FIve want to hold on to power, so they bought E.
2208 2018-03-19 19:18:55 Woohoo! An instant win AND the coveted Banana Oil trophy!

2212 2018-03-19 19:18:37 churches are full of charlatans and snake oil salesmen all their property should be taxed so the tax base is expanded so citizens pay less, if you want to donate to a church fine get a tax break but no more giving the hypocrites tax breaks.
2213 2018-03-19 19:18:36 Today, the bus driver is telling me all the old country remedies from his childhood. Vick’s salve, castor oil and “sugar tit:” a rag soaked with butter, sugar, and a drop of kerosene to clear his lungs.
2214 2018-03-19 19:18:18 @NafisMarwanR Hi its James from the C&C chat. Hey I am doing the same things as you but the rocket buggies and gattling cannon trucks attack mr from the cliffs and kill my supply trucks and vehicles and oil derrick (especially if I load a save). how did you stop this?

2216 2018-03-19 19:17:45 Their economy will never be diversified, it will never veer from oil and natural gas, that's all they do. But the guy rebuilt his country & military while we wasted 10 trillion in the Middle East. Seemed to put quite a scare into a lot of Americans too, u know, the 'meddling' 
2217 2018-03-19 19:17:37 Ethics, honesty and qualifications for this WH are unknowns. They are like oil and water--can never blend or mix. Cynics and government haters don't seem to mind at all. Alert and decent Americans find this revolting.
2218 2018-03-19 19:17:36 lol omg! Smh. I keep mine on the Lo setting. Also if you’re into burning oils & stuff, I put my fabuloso in my oil burner too! Has the same effect.
2219 2018-03-19 19:17:35 If you don't get a Costco membership, what are you gonna do that day you need 10 pounds of hot dogs, 6 gallons of vegetable oil, a garage door opener, and snow tires?
2220 2018-03-19 19:17:30 Weren't most of the Sunday talk shows back in the day sponsored by oil companies at one point -- followed by Big Ag (Archer-Daniels-Midland)? Try getting away with that today!! LOL!!
2221 2018-03-19 19:17:30 Sitting, waiting to get my oil change & there are like 5 different people talking on the phone

2223 2018-03-19 19:17:17 wow; this teatree oil has been doing wonders for my skin. i wish i took before and after pictures
2224 2018-03-19 19:17:14 Facebook mining by Cambridge Analytica funded by  Republican Donors facilitated by Steve Bannon, Corey  Lewandowski & a Russian-American with ties to a Russian oil company = Russian targeting of Americans in swing districts. Money to pay for this flowing through the Seychelles?
2225 2018-03-19 19:16:57 Oregano oil!
2226 2018-03-19 19:16:39 America needs to KEEP PUMPING oil to suffocate these prices bringing them down to a level where REGULAR mortals can afford them ! "Car Insurance" peddlers are the very next cancer needing to be suffocted and REDUCED to the same level !
2227 2018-03-19 19:16:36 I rubbed agave body oil on my belly at work~self carelmao

2229 2018-03-19 19:16:00 Roads for oil mining?
2230 2018-03-19 19:15:53 Probably has an oil leak or sum
2231 2018-03-19 19:15:48 Where ever The petroleum cartel can't get there nasty hands on oil Or the Federal reserve can't manipulate currency we seem to have sanctions that harm people or Boots on the ground . Your policy is total BS Don..
2232 2018-03-19 19:15:46 You should be pissed he's doing the bidding of Wall St., big pharma, big oil, just like I am when Dems take Wall St. or Silicon Valley money. People on the left and the right should both be fighting money in politics and our country will be a lot better once we win that fight.
2233 2018-03-19 19:15:44 Me handing over cash to pay off my loan for $580 and to pay off my $350 car loan today and I still gotta do an oil change and grocery shop  money come money go bye bye 
2234 2018-03-19 19:15:34 Jim you are being conned and have been more so since the 70s with oil discovery. Don't accept it.
2235 2018-03-19 19:15:31 Even if you beat us I doubt you'll win it. Anyone can play at the top with unlimited oil money so don't flatter yourselves. Money might buy you trophies but will never buy you love. Shows in your complete & utter shite support you have.
2236 2018-03-19 19:15:25 I LOVE the @theouai hair oil. Really want to try the shampoo/conditioner. Has anyone tried it? Thoughts!? 
2237 2018-03-19 19:15:02 This is actually the longest I’ve had it out! since January my hair has seen no weave or braids nothing all it’s been seeing is a lot of oil treatment and hair food
2238 2018-03-19 19:14:55 An economic miracle can always be replicated by investment in human resources. That is the only sustainable resources not Oil or Dollars.
2239 2018-03-19 19:14:52 Made kale chips last night. This particular batch was much better fresh from the oven. I think I used too much oil and should not have put them in a plastic bag. Duly noted for next batch. #foodie #foodislife #foodismedicine
2240 2018-03-19 19:14:50 Does coconut oil really help with hair growth 
2241 2018-03-19 19:14:35 Some people I know that discovered coconut oil, live, breathe, and eat coconut oil in and on everything
2242 2018-03-19 19:14:35 milk + chocolate protein powder + peanut butter + honey + a little bit of olive oil for extra calories
2243 2018-03-19 19:14:35 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

2246 2018-03-19 19:13:32 I want to know absolutely everything that's happened until now,
First the Earth cooled, then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat and died and they turned into oil

2259 2018-03-19 19:11:25 Don't dip your goods in water....that will spread the oil around.  rub bread on your goods.
2260 2018-03-19 19:11:20 Sure its not for the Oil rigs?
After all you did sell out wilderness for the tax scam.
2261 2018-03-19 19:11:13 I think we might be talking about the same thing.. Tokens are the fluid/ glue that makes the ecosystem work, align and evolve. Engines need oil to work and oil needs engines to have purpose/ value.

2272 2018-03-19 19:10:09 Incident 230 of 19/03/2018 refers to theft of heating oil for a property on Heighington Road, Canwick.

Offender(s) have removed a large quantity of heating oil.

This has occurred sometime over the weekend.

2275 2018-03-19 19:09:42 I've always said I enjoy general assignment reporting because you get to learn about a lot of different things. But honestly, I could've gone without learning exactly how fish meal and fish oil are made.
2276 2018-03-19 19:09:36 I hate hate hate going to get my car's oil changed.

2280 2018-03-19 19:09:05 "A pointless meander from nowhere to nowhere." would be my review. Trump has opened all our coasts to oil drilling and turned over precious nation monuments to frackers.
2281 2018-03-19 19:09:04 @chrisinsilico I'm scared for you: You named a Russian oil company.  You need @MichaelAvenatti .
2282 2018-03-19 19:09:03 @SalishTankers tracks oil tanker traffic to and from refineries and terminals on the west coast. In the current debate about pipelines in Canada, it’s often lost that there are 5 refineries in WA State vs. 1 in BC. US tanker traffic far exceeds Canadian tanker traffic.

2291 2018-03-19 19:08:10 The one that split? That Polar Vortex? Arctic winters now tend to be warm and sees sea ice melt. Read the science and stop buying snake oil! You have the basic knowledge but you can’t face up to it, that is your problem. Courage!
2292 2018-03-19 19:08:04 2) Before the taking of Kirkuk by iraqis the British oil companies had already signed agreements with Iraq for Kirkuk oil
2293 2018-03-19 19:07:37 lol thinkin bout puttin lots a baby oil on my girlfriend

2296 2018-03-19 19:07:03 No impurities! Not to be mistaking for veggie oil.
2297 2018-03-19 19:07:01 Yes the 70% private economy is obviously socialism! Recessions could never be cause by a massive decrease in oil prices (Venezuela's main export), and then have the situation made worse by rich capitalists trying to make a profit!
2298 2018-03-19 19:06:59 All that baby oil isn’t gonna get cleaned up itself
2299 2018-03-19 19:06:46 Just pulled up for an oil change...they better not tell me shit else is wrong me my car

2302 2018-03-19 19:06:24 Are they just out of alignment? Also I found in Berlin that cold really affects hub gears. May a night indoors and a squirt of oil?
2303 2018-03-19 19:06:24 Me right now: plastic bag over hair, soaking in coconut oil.

2306 2018-03-19 19:05:55 But it shouldn't be used with some hormonal cancers as high thc makes some cancers worse, until we've done more research about it I won't feel happy recommending it to any cancer patients. CBD oil though is great for the side effects of chemo :)
2307 2018-03-19 19:05:54 How about sanctioning France for unleashing the murderous religious theocracy on Iran and Iranians, by sending Khomeini to take over the country 40 years ago!?  Surely it wasn’t for human rights, was it for cheap oil? @AFP @khamenei_ir @HassanRouhani @CNN
2308 2018-03-19 19:05:46 We know what they do but this time they went very far and paid a lot of Money to get our personal info from FB to give to an Oil Giant in Russia. Now tell me Jules, what would interest an Oil Giant of Russia's to want that info? I'll wait...
2309 2018-03-19 19:05:41 Canada has been gamed in the oil game !our people have been tricked by Foreign Government and Foreign Companies! They are pumping and shipping their Oil and making a profit. While we lose a fortune everyday!!Nice Guys Finish Last!!

2311 2018-03-19 19:05:34 Poor little denier. Look up those papers I mentioned.

The world is warming. The ice is melting. Sea levels are rising.

A GSM would give a transient 0.3°C cooling! The LIA was only 0.5°C cooler than early 1900s temperatures. Stop buying snake oil! Read the real science!
2312 2018-03-19 19:05:32 Switch to olive oil and shea butter
2313 2018-03-19 19:05:17 ironically "paprika oil" and "paprika extract" still are english words
2314 2018-03-19 19:05:17 This has got to be the most utterly moronic piece of garbage I've had the misfortune of reading. You do know that they English Premier League is being propped up by oligarch's, oil sheiks and absurd TV deals? Scottish Football will be just fine, cunto.
2315 2018-03-19 19:05:11 Nope. Big Pharma is one of the biggest lobbying groups out there besides Big Oil, Big Tech, and the NRA
2316 2018-03-19 19:05:07 Producers price oil (spot & forward) in $. Spot $/CNY is irrelevant to futures contracts priced in Yuan which enable producers to hedge forward sales to China. Producers need only sell forward to China at depressed $ price levels if they are distressed by inability to store oil

2322 2018-03-19 19:04:29 Meanwhile in the real world; tankers are moving through Canadian waters every day without incident. Only tankers bound for expanded facilities in Canada are blocked by the Liberals in order to kill Alberta oil.

2329 2018-03-19 19:03:49 No, it's got minimal thc in it in the UK, by law it has to be under 0.03% or 1mg per 1000mg. Cannabis oil however, the stuff in the pipettes that apparently 'cures' cancer is full plant extract including THC.
2330 2018-03-19 19:03:48 My yiayia told me she’s concerned that I’m not eating enough olive oil while at school, and if that isn’t the Greekest thing you’ve ever heard in your life than idk what is.

2344 2018-03-19 19:02:20 Another speaker warns of snake oil CUAS companies. @TheDroneDealer
2345 2018-03-19 19:02:18 Ok so what is your suggestion. Gas prices are skyrocketing. Electric is no good because they use “oil” to make them. So what. Transit and bike is not an option for me at my profession.  So let’s hear your brilliant suggestion.  At least w/ electric i save money.
2346 2018-03-19 19:02:12 I buy all my on amazon what about you?? 
Im trying to hop on fish oil pills too  do you take those?
2347 2018-03-19 19:02:07 The CBD oil (no THC) is working wonders for the anxiety.

Now I’m only bored out of my mind at work instead of desperate and upset .
2348 2018-03-19 19:01:42 I was weaned on Huntley - Brinkley.

When was that?

I remember an oil tanker in the intro.
2349 2018-03-19 19:01:37 Bihhhh my dealer is $1OO don’t wanna go there, yours take synthetic oil too?

2351 2018-03-19 19:01:33 Nigga dropped that Welch’s grape jelly & picked up a bottle of baby oil & just hoed out
2352 2018-03-19 19:01:30  finish the beardless fake oil dealer
2353 2018-03-19 19:01:28 An incredible tapestry giving the history of oil currently on display at the Glenbow Museum! @Glenbow #talkenergy #YYC
2354 2018-03-19 19:01:26 At this point I think there will be no major changes to Oil in off-season. PK & PP better. Troika of 97, RNH, 29 getting figured out. Cam back in form. Klef healthy & Bear coming on D. Yam & maturing Jesse.  No GM/coach change, maybe assistants (Coffey). Maybe find 1 wing.

2359 2018-03-19 19:00:54 KRG cabinet statement says Baghdad failed in its duty to pay all salaries- Baghdad tells us they had agreemnt w Krg tt 1/2 salary from Fed govt and 1/2 fr Krg oil revenue. Fed payment made + 1/2 salary paid.
2360 2018-03-19 19:00:50 RT @LS_Nutrition: Remind #patients this March: #Safflower Oil #supplements can interact with #Anticoagulants and other drugs.
2361 2018-03-19 19:00:33 I mean it was never a good idea to hand your BTC over to a dictator, whose country is in default on billions in debt, in exchange for an IOU for oil.
2362 2018-03-19 19:00:33 Yeah. But oil prices hit bottom in 1998. Then rise to a peak in 2008. This, more than anything Putin did, explains Russians' rising fortunes.
2363 2018-03-19 19:00:29 My dream man is a basketball player with a connecting beard or an Arab with some oil money.  But that's all it is,  a dream

Marijuana, sugar, alcohol or tobacco
2367 2018-03-19 19:00:21 Goes right to root of problem. Democrats hate that because it dismantles all faux arguments and makes identity politics irrelevant.
2368 2018-03-19 19:00:19 Kiir appoints official acquitted in theft case as oil ministry undersecretary. What's the logic behind apeasing criminals in a system????

2372 2018-03-19 19:00:14 I’m listening to songs from a playlist titled songs to sing in the shower & I’ve got coconut oil in my hair doing its thing. My mood is improving.
2373 2018-03-19 19:00:04 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy

2375 2018-03-19 18:59:55 diGenova looks like he sells counterfeit snake oil. 

BTW, @screwgub has the PRIMO Snakeoil, highly recommend you check it out
2376 2018-03-19 18:59:51 Try using baking soda mixed with peppermint oil for a natural and non-abrasive clean. Also rinse/ gargle with sea salt & warm water for the swollen gums & cavities -works like a charm (you could also just brush with the sea salt although it obvs doesn’t taste great )
2377 2018-03-19 18:59:42 nothing except the smuggling of oil from Iraqi Kurdistan to Israel via Turkey
2378 2018-03-19 18:59:37 According to CRT the Lee navigation is open, mind you they have said that before only to close it a few days later. The Environment Agency have cleared as much oil as possible but small pockets will remain around moored boats, this will be  cleaned over coming weeks.
2379 2018-03-19 18:59:31 See: Sheehan, Cindy. Gold until Obama.
2380 2018-03-19 18:59:25 (hes covered in oil)
2381 2018-03-19 18:59:22 Yah Letestu could one time it, except it would take him an hour to getting a shooting position. So Strome can move quicker but doesn't one time it, and is actually slow at making decisions with the puck: upgrade or downgrade?
2382 2018-03-19 18:59:18 How do we allow this to happen every week ? We know that this is nothing more than a tax grab by the government right ??? Oil is at 61$/ barrel !!! Are you kidding me !!
2383 2018-03-19 18:59:03 Persian or Jazz
Abyssinian oil makes me think of cats. Pink makes me think of Persians since it begins with a P and they are a beautiful breed.
Smooth and soft hair is like Jazz music. Relaxing and it moves you.
2384 2018-03-19 18:58:58 The UK & US didn't go in to protect the Kurds, they went in on the basis of a lie and to rob Iraq of it's assets and Oil
2385 2018-03-19 18:58:58 With your support, BF was able to distribute blankets, shoes, coats, gloves, rice, flour & oil to families in various parts of the country.
2386 2018-03-19 18:58:57 Du får lese partiprogramma til dei som sit i regjering. Sjå om det ikkje står noko om privat eigarskap kontra statleg. Det er nok Stat i navnet som smertar, ikkje oil.
2387 2018-03-19 18:58:56 ... filled with skunk oil
2388 2018-03-19 18:58:23 Whilst it is theoretically true that deals on Scotch whisky won’t be held up by negotiations on Greek tobacco or Italian olive oil, the reality is a bloc of 500m consumers has considerably more negotiating power than one of 60m.
2389 2018-03-19 18:57:43 using baby oil to soften my skin makes me feel so soft lol i feel like a baby now
2390 2018-03-19 18:57:39 And money from foreign powers that want to control us....like Tides, a California based anti Canadian oil lobby
2391 2018-03-19 18:57:39 Got a facial earlier with an oil treatment for my dry af face. Immediately had a dr appointment afterwards. I bet they’re thinking I have showered in a week. Hell nah... I’m just boujee
2392 2018-03-19 18:57:27 It is claimed that Listeriosis dies at 60 degrees. Quarter filling like polony, Russians, Viennas etc are fried at boiling oil. Why should kasie food outlets suffer? Just a thought.
2393 2018-03-19 18:57:24 Hate to say it but, no. BMW's were all air cooled flat twins at the time. 

I want an oil head.
2394 2018-03-19 18:57:20 Getting my oil changed hyyyyypppeee
2395 2018-03-19 18:57:18 In this household we use coconut oil for everything but moisturizing your face with it. 
2396 2018-03-19 18:57:01 mopped my room with orange essential oil, check!
2397 2018-03-19 18:56:58 This same tactic is how Kim Jong-il convinced the US government to remove sanctions and provide them oil. And in secret, the reactors kept running, making refined uranium and plutonium.
2398 2018-03-19 18:56:55 Battery low , low tire pressure, oil change needed  like ok shut up
2399 2018-03-19 18:56:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! Hip-hop is a mind control technique invented to get people’s hands in the air! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2400 2018-03-19 18:56:51 Wow I just looked this up, outrageous. Perfect example of the idea we can combine some stripped down industrial "foods" like vegetable oil, pour in tons of vitamin supplements, and pretend it's a valid alternative to, you know, an actual meal made from, hey, actual ingredients.
2401 2018-03-19 18:56:42 Put it on a rack and fill the roasting tin with boiling water (about an inch) rub olive oil into the skin cover with foil - cook on a low heat initially - should work like a steamer
2402 2018-03-19 18:56:41 That coconut oil is good for your face IT AINT
2403 2018-03-19 18:56:37 I pray to God my sister takes me car in to get an oil change today  or else I’m fucked because I don’t have time 
2404 2018-03-19 18:56:36 Even with the oil they're still cave men
2405 2018-03-19 18:56:31 Dying for a rich man's selfish desires is not Patriotism. Refusing to do so is.

Debt Slaves love to oil the Masters whip.
2406 2018-03-19 18:56:27 You’re a snake skin oil vapor vaper.
2407 2018-03-19 18:56:19 Lmao is tea tree oil supposed to burn or should I douse myself in cold water immediately 
2408 2018-03-19 18:56:16 3/18 dinner: mushroom pizza, edamame 

3/19 breakfast: plain yogurt w blueberries, olive oil, honey
2409 2018-03-19 18:56:00 it's too heavy for my face, causes me to produce a lot of oil and that leads to whiteheads I get
2410 2018-03-19 18:56:00 “I need an oil change. It doesn’t mean I’m out of oil. Just that it needs to be changed.” #shitShanikasays
2411 2018-03-19 18:55:55 @pulpmx how often did you change the oil on a fork at Factory Yamaha and redo the coils during the outdoor series?
2412 2018-03-19 18:55:50 The girl who’s doing my paperwork for this oil change is lovely man lemme tell you. Customer service 11/10
2413 2018-03-19 18:55:36 The oil was drippppping flowing like a river!
2414 2018-03-19 18:55:34 @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC I can't fucking believe you're covering his whole speech. I turned down the volume so I wouldn't have to listen to the vacuous, mendacious, egotistical, megalomaniacal, needy, low-class, snake oil salesman con man called @realDonaldTrump and there he is spewing
2415 2018-03-19 18:55:32 Jojoba oil is THAT bitch
2416 2018-03-19 18:55:23 I just tried using tea tree oil on my skin for the first time and I’m obsessed
2417 2018-03-19 18:55:22 Fuck me UP w peppermint essential oil
2418 2018-03-19 18:55:14 Hillary and Bill are more connected than Trump.

Your hatred blinds you.
2419 2018-03-19 18:55:11 Did you know that you can apply Coriander to the back of neck or bottom of feet to promote relaxation.  Dilute with dōTERRA Fractionated Coconut Oil to minimize any skin sensitivity. Coriander comes in 15mL Bottles.
2420 2018-03-19 18:55:11 coba vco(virgin coco oil)+baking soda bang, bilasan terakhir pakai air+cuka apel.
2421 2018-03-19 18:55:06 It does. Skin over produces sebum when it’s dehydrated so adding moisture back in by using hyaluronic acid, drinking water, jojoba oil will help balance the skin out.
2422 2018-03-19 18:54:51 Fishing is sold out; oil  industry let go down the drain; Grampian left for dead and no one gives a ****.
2423 2018-03-19 18:54:48 Vene needs light oil as an input into its refineries right, and gets it from the US, so by trying to block it the US is trying to speed up the collapse of the regime?
2424 2018-03-19 18:54:39 What's up with the oil slick that's always on the left side of your head @realDonaldTrump ?
Ear infection?  Herpes?
2425 2018-03-19 18:54:33 Admiration and respect to Donad Trump, as a painter I wish to paint in oil to the presidential family Donald and Melanie. Do I require authorization? 593 998120249
2426 2018-03-19 18:54:14 lmfao. Their economy is shit, and his increased aggressiveness suggests it's even worse then it seems.

he wasn't smart enough to diversify away from oil back when it was $100+ and now he's paying the price
2427 2018-03-19 18:53:48 While we continue to buy their oil? Hmm.
2428 2018-03-19 18:53:42 Oil paints and I never get along

2432 2018-03-19 18:53:07 War not pretty and neat it’s messy and unfair Bush started this war remember for oil not even for the Americans who died on 911
2433 2018-03-19 18:53:06 The spf one is a lie, but your technically don't need mosturizer if your oily, you should get a vitamin e oil, or an oily in the same family & use it for a whole season and it will normalize your skin.
2434 2018-03-19 18:53:04 ....and another thing! A few weeks ago I did a full service and pin change on our mini digger and got sprayed in the face and arms by steaming hot hydraulic oil and fuck knows what’s in it but they won’t heal at all!
2435 2018-03-19 18:53:02 I'm useding vegetable oil spread cuz the butter is unspreadable

2437 2018-03-19 18:52:31 when you have to drive all the way to New Iberia for a oil change just glad i got this out the way though
2438 2018-03-19 18:52:29 Coconut oil on the beard before you go down on shorty 
2439 2018-03-19 18:52:14 Well now they have individual sanctions on the drug dealers and the passport sellers. And there are sanctions on using capital markets for new debt.  And cutting off oil sales actually drives them closer into the arms of Russia, China and Iran.
2440 2018-03-19 18:52:00 I must like the idea of blowing up in a car or something because I always leave this oil thing for the last minute

Don't worry unless the US itself comes to invade your plate of fried potatoes.
Your food is healthy.
2444 2018-03-19 18:51:39 WHY DID THIS OIL CHANGE TAKE 2 HOURS

2446 2018-03-19 18:51:18 Alberto has many projects planned and said even possibly movies. 

Why isn't he doing oil painting like his uncle? Does he make his own cheese like Vampiro?
2447 2018-03-19 18:51:17 So are we to cut down our Forrest’s for steel or put o2 scrubbers on the stacks.   Currently we scrub the stacks even in electrical production and it is cleaner for the environment than oil
2448 2018-03-19 18:51:15 U.S. oil prices give back nearly all of last week's gains
2449 2018-03-19 18:51:09 I try to tell everyone coconut oil does more damage than help to your face!
2450 2018-03-19 18:51:07 toothpaste gets rid of pimples, coconut oil is the best thing ever for skin, the usuals i think but never heard the hand sanitizer one
2451 2018-03-19 18:51:06 Can y’all start exfoliating yalls backs please? It takes but a sec to reach the loofah back there and give it a Lil scrub. Because y’all upper backs be looking like chocolate chip cookies. All that oil and dirt from ur weaves just creating pimples all over ur backs 
2452 2018-03-19 18:51:05 I was on the steps of Parliament and I’ve listened to the audio again and unless the Prime Minister whispered it or my recording cut out she did not once mention the block offer. She gave a clear impression she was talking about an end to oil exploration.
2453 2018-03-19 18:51:04 I used 4 cheeses, and ran our of breadcrumbs, but they were toasted with garlic and olive oil. Baked for about 15 minutes, edges were crisp
2454 2018-03-19 18:50:59 If you do bleach your hair. Line the base with coconut oil before applying the chemicals. Another option is buying hair the colour you want or bleaching hair after you buy it. Colour would look bomb on you tbh
2455 2018-03-19 18:50:43 I was in the phone shop waiting to get my phone fixed and this dude was saying how he puts these cannabis oil drops on his children tongue so she won’t get ill

2457 2018-03-19 18:50:38 Oil stocks are selling off. #crudeoil isn't. Take notice.
2458 2018-03-19 18:50:33 You might also want to include water ecosystems, food systems and ocean health in your narrowly crafted comment. The argument against expansion includes many facets from indeginous right, BC tourism economy, orca population, oil spill  recovery, bitumen dispersant info etc etc
2459 2018-03-19 18:50:25 Egypt does not have oil, it also has years of civilization dating to the pharaohs go read some books
2460 2018-03-19 18:50:20 What about grape seed oil?
2461 2018-03-19 18:50:16 Chinese technique - velvetting. Oil or water (I use water) bring pan to the boil, chuck in chicken (diced) turn heat OFF leave it for about 4/5 mins, cooked through and the opposite of dry! Eat it like that or throw it in sauces etc.
2462 2018-03-19 18:50:15 IMO they are trying to stop the flow of physical oil that might support CNY contract - Russia, Venezuela, Iran
2463 2018-03-19 18:50:14 why do women have to be hairless beings dipped in oil and put on display but men can scratch their bare assholes in public and look like wildebeests ? not fair
2464 2018-03-19 18:50:13 While oil & gas are v important for Russia's exports, they account for <20% of GDP so they alone do not explain movements in GDPpc. Note also that oil & gas were equally or more important in the 1970-80s but people hardly focused on them to explain growth of USSR.
2465 2018-03-19 18:50:10 Moroccan oil ! Swear by it but then age has kicked in and #extensions
2466 2018-03-19 18:50:02 Yes, India is the best alternative. Since oil exports to the US also fell, the decline might just be the result of collapsing production.
2467 2018-03-19 18:49:59 @juliemason we already have an effective, non-addictive pain killer, hemp-based CBD oil, but it is categorized a Schedule 1 drug *rolleyes*

Well that and oil.

2470 2018-03-19 18:49:32 Fun Fact: coconut oil is too heavy to be used on your face. Castor oil is safe, Olive oil is safe, Kukui oil is safe and argan oil, tea tree, and rose oil
2471 2018-03-19 18:49:13 necesito plata pa comprarme tea tree oil y mascarillas :(
2472 2018-03-19 18:49:05 Yeah but £250 seems a bit extreme for an oil change, right?
2473 2018-03-19 18:49:04 Con un plan de gobierno de abajo oil, se van inv extranjeros de sector minería, mas presión arriba dólar posible 3500 cop por dólar, deficit mas grande y país con crédito al 8.5% minimo...
2474 2018-03-19 18:49:01 So they are equal opportunity meddlers for Russian oil giants?
2475 2018-03-19 18:48:59 @elonmusk get some flammable oil in a jar, light it with fire, get another empty jar, pour ibto 2nd jar

2482 2018-03-19 18:47:49 Also define soon?  Other than your useless rhetoric, I’ve seen no realistic study that suggest this can be done before 2050 at the earliest. That’s beyond the useful economic life of an oil sands facility and a pipeline, so what’s your issue with extraction today?
2483 2018-03-19 18:47:48 IT IS BAD TO SLIDE YOUR VEHICLE DOWN THE SLOPE WITH GEAR LEVER IN NEUTRAL POSITION (Automatic Vehicle)...
It deprives the transmission of proper lubrication by stopping oil supply causing wear. The repair costs are not worth the negligible fuel savings.
2484 2018-03-19 18:47:42 I need some coconut oil for these bitches
2485 2018-03-19 18:47:14 My father worked in the oil industry back in the 80s - some colleagues visited the UK from Eastern Europe, they had a free afternoon and my father asked them whether he could take them sightseeing and instead they just asked him to take them to a supermarket.
2486 2018-03-19 18:46:53 I use coconut oil; LOTS of it! And water... drink lots and lots.

I love the Adirondacks... Similar tho here, although, more up in the mountaints. You'll never dessicate THERE!
2487 2018-03-19 18:46:49 The eco freaks want less oil to the coast so I say we should oblige them and see how they do with their own in-house eco campaign.  I wonder if they have ANY idea how many products they're using have or are transported with oil?  Doubt it.
2488 2018-03-19 18:46:47 It is not oil. It's tears of fans ...
2489 2018-03-19 18:46:40 Oh I forgot my magical recipe to ease the cold and breathe: Tea (whatever sort you prefer, I like green or rooibos) 
Fresh pealed Ginger. Lemon slices or squeeze it in. Honey bc it can be sour. 2-3 drops of Japanese peppermint oil. And sometimes I add a little rum too - Cheers;)
2490 2018-03-19 18:46:32 what about me soaked down head to toe with baby oil playing super smash brawl at your house OwO???
2491 2018-03-19 18:46:22 They are liberalizing the country. MS has basically banished the mullahs that had so much power. Hes allowing some women to drive. He's trying to be more like UAE because he knows oil can only do so much for them and their people. These are good changes.
2492 2018-03-19 18:46:07 We’ve gone to changing hub oils every year,  have one tractor with 3000hrs haven’t touched a seal.  Oil is cheap.
2493 2018-03-19 18:45:51 お前ら寝ろよ
2494 2018-03-19 18:45:50 I need to get an oil change ughhhh
2495 2018-03-19 18:45:43 We should send them food, they send us oil. Nobody should go hungry. It sad the country is so screwed up with resources like Venezuela has... Give up some oil, we will send the food...and some troops to hand it out so you don’t screw that up as well
2496 2018-03-19 18:45:33 I'm Venezuelan It is NOT a crypto. Is Venezuelan oil debt that can't be dig. only bought by some corrupts narco dealers investigate about Goodman sachs and Venezuela
2497 2018-03-19 18:45:20 I do agree with ur first statment through, US is dependent on their oil, that is what it was all about.. pure economically driven war, paid for by the flesh and blood of the innocents
2498 2018-03-19 18:45:19 They are training and preparing to protect mom and dad right here at home. Not Gona fight for Gold,oil,and dope!
2499 2018-03-19 18:45:13 It's why the UK government haven't given a damn about things like renewables, which could have been a key economy for Aberdeen if/when oil runs out: it just doesn't matter to the UK gov in London. It would to a gov of 5 million in Edinburgh,
2500 2018-03-19 18:45:07 #IfIWereAFoodOrDrink I'd be a living can of orange slices doused in chili oil!
2501 2018-03-19 18:44:58 I’m already a husk of a person. So.... do they have olive oil, or moose oil that I can slather up with? Cuz if so I’m good. You Canadians are very lucky. I also want to go to Nunavit. But let me get to the Adirondacks first...
2502 2018-03-19 18:44:56 This about our beautiful coast getting ruined by an oil spill..no one has proven to me they have enough safety measures and clean up measures in place to warrant more tankers..
2503 2018-03-19 18:44:33 I said the same thing about goons protesting during the Petroleum conf. in Calgary some decades past. If they had any integrity they would not use any gas/oil enabled transports to get there or any modern conveniences that enjoy petroleum uses. But we all know they're hypocrites.
2504 2018-03-19 18:44:27 Seriously tho, today's projects thus far:

1) Taking in a gunbelt and recutting/finishing the buckle attachment point.
2) Heating and applying a wax/oil mix to two pieces for a portmanteau design I'm working on
3) Try hand-stitching those pieces together after letting wax set
2505 2018-03-19 18:44:16 Thank you for your opinion.  You’re allowed to have one because this is Canada. I don’t know how you jumped from oil sands being uneconomic to assuming I am a climate change denier based on my economic beliefs. You really are full of left wing virtue signalling taking points
2506 2018-03-19 18:44:09 I hope the shortage is due to the regulations they put on these companies who use an abundance of Palm oil.  Huge pollutors and absolutely destroying the rainforest. #beforethestorm
2507 2018-03-19 18:44:07 I understand.  I use the argan oil Eco Styler too and it doesn't do that much for me either. You're welcome!
2508 2018-03-19 18:44:05 Change the oil in my car but you have to be naked
2509 2018-03-19 18:44:00 Avoid movie theatre #popcorn. Most contain ~1 tsp harmful #saturated fat #coconut oil/cup of UNbuttered popcorn
2510 2018-03-19 18:43:57 That's the key argument for independence. Scotland is only 5 million people out of 60 million. Democratically we don't matter. Economically, none of our cities matter. Our economy - whisky, oil, etc does - but the cities and people around them? Nope.

2519 2018-03-19 18:43:12 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2525 2018-03-19 18:42:28 I wanna hear everyone’s opinion on coconut oil in coffee
2526 2018-03-19 18:42:16 How do people drive around missing hubcaps? It costs less than an oil change for a brand new set of 4
2527 2018-03-19 18:42:15 My Gelato oil gets me through the day 
2528 2018-03-19 18:42:09 How do you add water while frying? Isn’t the oil going to be all over the place?
2529 2018-03-19 18:41:59 who has cannabis oil in columbus?!?
2530 2018-03-19 18:41:53 I truly hate the smell of coconut oil idk how these beauty gurus are using it head to toe cause it “smells good”
2531 2018-03-19 18:41:50 studies confirm that that once Mr. Drumpf breathes heavily, a member of congress whistles the #starspangledbanner
2532 2018-03-19 18:41:50 People are dying in Venezuela from corruption of a practical dictatorship... external pressure on oil sales too doesn’t help

Who’s we? Talk for yourself.  If you want to talk about American history talk about all elements then.. the issues lie in the present not the past
2533 2018-03-19 18:41:49 I'm just slicker than niggas like olive oil.
2534 2018-03-19 18:41:45 Hey guys, you didn't say how many litres of oil you are going to carry...
2535 2018-03-19 18:41:35 think i over did it with the cocunt oil today
2536 2018-03-19 18:41:35 If steel is a national security issue why not have a strategic reserve like we have with oil?

2538 2018-03-19 18:41:11 #RT @cryptoSqueeze: RT @needacoin: If history has taught you nothing you don't mess with oil.
2539 2018-03-19 18:41:07 I didn’t call her a liar. Where’s the proof? I said it’s impossible. Which is a fact. There needs to be truth behind a claim. Or else we’d still all be using snake oil.
2540 2018-03-19 18:40:59 That’s not true at all. There is an economic benefit to AB, Sask, BC and everyone else. If we stop selling our oil at a huge discount, we all make more. Do you think the GST rate was lowered by magic?
2541 2018-03-19 18:40:43 Depends on the zombie. Ubiquitous Romero/Walking Dead ones need brainstem destruction (headshot, hammer, vehicle, acid, etc). Return of the Living Dead ones can't be killed - containment is only option. Oil drums work ok, unless opened by curious teens/careless handling.

2543 2018-03-19 18:40:21 Finally got to great "cut everyone a cheque" piece by @irbrodie. No essay can address everything but it did raise two qs

1.) What about inter-generational equity? Piece does note we won't run out of oil soon- maybe  answer enough. I'd like to see issue explicitly addressed tho.
2544 2018-03-19 18:40:16 With all the talk about cbd oil, what makes one better than another.  experts only please.

2550 2018-03-19 18:40:00 Or.. portions.. pan fry with some butter and oil for about 10-15 mins, or poach it with some chicken stock..
2551 2018-03-19 18:39:36 @jacindaardern NZ and the world still need oil, and will continue to do so long after we transition to other energy sources. To stop exploration is a virtue signalling exercise that will impoverish us. @winstonpeters @simonjbridges @JudithCollinsMP

2554 2018-03-19 18:39:31 For soup, cook sliced shallots in oil, then simmer with fish, rosemary, mushroom broth and spinach. Top with tortilla strips.
2555 2018-03-19 18:39:10 I grew up in NOLA, it was polluted early on by oil. Politics were frequently corrupt or controlled by money. So I've seen this before.
2556 2018-03-19 18:39:02 I thought it was backed by their oil. ?
2557 2018-03-19 18:39:01 I have great news for everyone. If someone can guess what it is I’ll send you a video of me rubbing oil all over my tatters 
2558 2018-03-19 18:38:54 no ji cong is back with their dirty tricks to grab power this time many regional parties are up to pour oil in burning fire. tough challenge 4 bjp and acid test for our mother nation
2559 2018-03-19 18:38:52 If oil falls in CNY but not in USD, what happens to CNY/USD?  :)
2560 2018-03-19 18:38:37 Roasting it? Butter and tarragon under the skin. Hot pan, oil, lay it breast side down for 15 mins, then turn every 15 mins till all four sides have been done and it's breast side up. The butter will baste it. Take it out oven and lt it rest for 15-20 mins.
2561 2018-03-19 18:38:05 So I did my sisters lashes and told her not to use any oil based products and she thought I said to use oil based products so she's been using pure coconut oil to remove her makeup
2562 2018-03-19 18:38:03 Is this petro something we should be looking to buy once oil finally gets back down big time? Also decent day today. I'm long waiting for that big blue arrow up. No problem going up making money.....before the inevitable fall to make even more :)

2566 2018-03-19 18:37:32 All the real money was made in real estate, stocks, gold or tsy's before 2007. So no. As a millennial, I've lost money in stocks (bought dow in 07) gold (bought in 2010) real estate (bought in Alberta before the oil crash)
2567 2018-03-19 18:37:28 Almost just got my fucking car totaled because some bitch thought it was ok to pass me & an oil truck around a corner & when she realized someone was right there she swerved back into my lane hard & fast almost hitting me. Don’t fucking drive if you don’t know how #roadrage
2568 2018-03-19 18:37:28 So you're against Oil companies? the tobacco industry? Most factories in the U.S who bribe politicians so they can dump their waste wherever they feel like it? NRA? ect...?
2569 2018-03-19 18:37:14 While I dislike Wynne as much as the next person - and take it from me, I'm not a fan - you seriously think the entire debt increase came from a single pair of Liberal premiers in Toronto? And not, y'know, the oil busts and government spending increasing to grow the econonmy?

2572 2018-03-19 18:37:00 Lavender is one of the best, all-purpose herbs and oils to have around. Use lavender for dream magic, grounding, emotional balance, easing anxiety, rebirth, and much much more.

Bonus: our Lavender essential oil is on sale at the moment!
2573 2018-03-19 18:36:55 I don’t use an oven AHA; I put oil in a pan, wait for it to be warm/hot and place one tortilla at a time? just so they’re not soggy but not hard.. like place one for 2 seconds, flip, dip in chile and then add cheese——

2579 2018-03-19 18:36:28 •A very smart convenience of taking    your car anywhere.

•Maybe not so good when the city comes and tickets you or tows it.

•But on the bright side, all that money you saved on gas,oil, and tires, you could afford to get taxed.

2585 2018-03-19 18:36:03 Looks like the 30mg of THC per ml of cannabis oil is staying - was really hoping this would be changed
2586 2018-03-19 18:36:02 Thoughtful isn't a word I'd use. As long as the demand for oil continues...this country should be a energy powerhouse and benefit from it economically.

2605 2018-03-19 18:34:03 2/2 Unlike oil gold is not consumed; is compact to store; and does not deteriorate. If China does what I would do then buyers will pull ICE priced physical bids & watch contango & stocks build while placing a $40/$45/bbl or equivalent standing futures bid in Shanghai

A keg of palm oil is N7,500 from farm and it's been sold N9,500 to N10,000 in the market.
If N100000 can buy close to 12 or 13 kegs and the profit on it will be 12 multiply N2000 or N2,500

2611 2018-03-19 18:33:35 It’s even so socialist that, while being supported by the United States and Israel, it went on a land grab to seize Syrian oil fields. Western “leftists” clamor to support the western countries pillaging oil from the middle east.

2615 2018-03-19 18:33:17 No you can't. You can believe it helped you with whatever issue you had, but you have zero proof that it wasn't something else that helped it or was t resolved naturally. Homeopathy is junk medicine. Modern day snake oil salesmen.

- calling net carb zeroing foods "free"
- less anxiety about carbs
2619 2018-03-19 18:32:52 I hate coming to get my oil changed 
2620 2018-03-19 18:32:52 Somewhere on main lol I was waiting for an oil change
2621 2018-03-19 18:32:43 Chap stick = underrated beard oil
2622 2018-03-19 18:32:41 Am I wrong, or do tits always smell like soap or perfume, or my personal fav, coconut suntan oil. Mmmmmmmm.
2623 2018-03-19 18:32:38 Moreso Sir,findout From If The M.D of KAWKAB OIL&GAS SYRIA,IF they are through with their followup of the network presidential acceptance later to the reply of the proposal they sent to the network as worldbank &,amerikan president directed them
2624 2018-03-19 18:32:35 ahh yes i did but i was given a nasal spray that i already had!! and i actually do have rhinitis :,-)  i'm currently relying on this essential oil that burned a hole in my wallet so we'll jst wait i guess hahah thank you tho!! 
2625 2018-03-19 18:32:16 Okay l think I can relate. Their cooking oil has a foreign scent yaz
2626 2018-03-19 18:32:14 May you be anointed with fresh oil. May you be imparted with a gift that you may serve God with joy and gladness in Jesus name. #Dailyprophecy
2627 2018-03-19 18:32:13 Actually that was from price of oil... which is up abput 26% since then. There was very little Harper could do about that. Today it's because of Trumps pro industry stance along with our weak industry stance plus soft wood and steel. All influenced by the sitting government.

2629 2018-03-19 18:31:56 Coffee with a scoop of Coconut Oil. If you’re doing fruit on your diet eat a banana too. If not you’ll be good to go
2630 2018-03-19 18:31:52 ...’kay.

As long as you bring the oil! 
2631 2018-03-19 18:31:50 #kplckenya pls siphon transformer oil faster then mwashe stima tutumie ...soon I'll be posting videos of your activities
2632 2018-03-19 18:31:49 Why no coconut oil on face? I would think it's fine for legs, but aloe may be better for soothing and healing.
2633 2018-03-19 18:31:47 I don't like to complain but my Waitrose ran out of prosciutto AND white truffle oil today and I just don't  understand why bad things like this keep happening to me  AM I A BAD PERSON????
2634 2018-03-19 18:31:42 Asking when will batteries kill fossil fuels is like asking when will oil pipelines kill horses.
2635 2018-03-19 18:31:41 Vesper Oil
2636 2018-03-19 18:31:34 They won't be once we stop sending oil there nor will they once gas climbs above +3.00 dollars a litre as a result.
2637 2018-03-19 18:31:23 Ugh I just want to get my oil paints already
2638 2018-03-19 18:31:12 Just wait until AB cuts off the supply of oil to you protesting yuppies.
2639 2018-03-19 18:31:04 Yes, sun has emitted slightly less radiation since 1980 yet the world has still warmed! Lot of snake oil being sold these days!
2640 2018-03-19 18:31:02 How big of a role do you think the decline in # of oil and gas mega-projects plays in this forecast?  For instance CVX Gorgon had 5 big GE units.
2641 2018-03-19 18:31:01 Several year's ago, I came across a White Paper that made the case that the next big war(s) would be fought over water. The White Paper was removed, but I remember Canada is to be invaded for our water. Not oil, water. Think about that.
2642 2018-03-19 18:31:00 Watermelon, Basil, Fresh Mozz with salt and pepper, balsamic vinegar, olive oil. ITS DOPE!
2643 2018-03-19 18:30:56 People pray for cake. Then God gives you the batter, eggs, oil, pan, and oven you get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
2644 2018-03-19 18:30:30 Would have to cut back on truffle oil though
2645 2018-03-19 18:30:27 RT @matt_odell: Maduro's real play is most likely mining.

Converting oil into $$ through mining. Hard to block or detect that. I'd be surprised if they don't already have a state owned mining op. They wouldn't tell us if they did but this article seems to imply they do: (1/2)
2646 2018-03-19 18:30:23 yooo

2649 2018-03-19 18:30:09 Wetin b d difference between person wey dey use anointing oil for good luck and one wey dey use juju(charm)? Either everything b juju or nothing b juju.
2650 2018-03-19 18:30:05 OIL DIFF: 4.07 -> 4.13
2651 2018-03-19 18:29:51 Well in Norway the left had the idea that oil companies should pay nearly 90% tax. That kinda worked. Single payer healthcare works. 1 year maternity leave works. Left ain't commies right ain't nazis
2652 2018-03-19 18:29:43 We usually stay in one spot for a week or two at a time, so it's easy to stock a kitchen well. And in most airbnbs the staples are already there (oil, spices, coffee, tea, etc).
2653 2018-03-19 18:29:41 A lot of it had to do also with government subsidizing housing, low oil prices and post ww2 boom. Suburbs are a recent creation, a product of the automobile.
2654 2018-03-19 18:29:36 If oil is settled in multiple currencies, producers no longer need to have the big if of cooperating (restricting supply.)  They can simply price oil in the currency that best suits them.  This shifts power to the producers in a much more sustainable way than a fragile cartel
2655 2018-03-19 18:29:20 U.S. considering all options to put pressure on Maduro regime in Venezuela, including oil sector sanctions. It would have ramifications not just for regime but also impact Caribbean and US economy - senior administration official

2659 2018-03-19 18:28:39 Why is Ruth Davidson, and what Ruth Davidson represents, so utterly terrified of RT? Could it be the RT analysis of the power struggles in the ME for land, oil and gas and oil pipelines which are in Syria and which belong to Syria?
2660 2018-03-19 18:28:35 On April 20th, 2010, 11 men lost their lives on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. so sad...
2661 2018-03-19 18:28:30 The meeet and oil which is sold in mall.big bazar......there is packing is already plastic...............so why they are not stop this things..........this is just fool things
2662 2018-03-19 18:28:28 NDP has proven to be just as corrupt and bought and sold
heres some examples
Alberta? Shilling for oil companies 
Saskatchewan? Selling potash corp and austerity 
BC? Calling welfare users cheats and varmints and slashing welfare. 
Manitoba? 17 years of highest poverty in Canada
2663 2018-03-19 18:28:12 Trump says it’s a hoax because all the people who gave him campaign money want coal to come back. They want coal, fracking and drilling for oil, so they paid Trump to say what he says. To endorse coal instead of renewable. To put tariffs on solar panels.

*reaching into nightstand drawer*

Her: KY is not an essential oil
2670 2018-03-19 18:27:33 Strange to think a few months ago I had never used a @LushLtd product, scared of what it might do to my skin. Now I use the Rose Toner Water, Coalface, Bubblegum Lip Scrub and the Marilyn Hot Oil Treatment AND can't wait to try more 
2671 2018-03-19 18:27:20 @jillyQVC @qvcuk I watched Judith’s dance on Germany’s Strictly equivalent and she was so beautiful. Her skin is glowing and she was a fab ambassador for her products and boy she can waltz. Even scored a 9! Well done Judith. My can’t live without product is your rose oil
2672 2018-03-19 18:27:20 Scrambled. I use Spanish olive oil. try not to eat the yolk as much. Yes , sure !
2673 2018-03-19 18:27:15 WTI oil at $62.28/barrel, near unchanged.
2674 2018-03-19 18:26:45 Maybe inviting them to appear is less productive than compelling them to appear?
2675 2018-03-19 18:26:24 A more likely reason SW Kansas salaries are relatively high is that it's harder to recruit and retain teachers. The salary situation predates the resurgence of the oil industry, which mostly targets a different workforce anyway.

2685 2018-03-19 18:25:49 Mr Godfrey, a caller on Buharimeter Radio asked ''considering that Ogoniland has contributed immensely to the economy of Nigeria, is it fair or correct that the @AsoRock rather has focused on oil exploration in the Chad Basin and spent huge sums of moment?

#Buharimeter
2686 2018-03-19 18:25:32 Well apparently we are not going to be going to exploring for oil or gas anymore in New Zealand so it will be interesting to see what relationships the Govt builds to guarantee foreign supplies are not restricted.
2687 2018-03-19 18:25:17 @RT_Erdogan MURDERER AND THIEF... YOU HAVE STOLEN THE OIL ON ALEPPO DESTROYED ALEPPO AND AFRIN... REVENGE IS COMMING.... AND SYRIA WILL BE BACK
2688 2018-03-19 18:25:17 Well, AGW alarmists keep backing down the curve. Yes, the oil companies have brought this stupidity upon themselves by pandering to such silliness, most Neville Chamberlain-like, by trying to appease rabid fools pretending to be scientists.
2689 2018-03-19 18:25:08 Diffusing eucalyptus, peppermint, and lavender oil while I sleep seems to help, too. Even if it's just placebo, it smells nice and the humidity helps.
2690 2018-03-19 18:24:59 Jesus I just saw an ad for a new St. Ives face wash w the featured ingredient COCONUT OIL I mean fuck first the apricot scrub and now this I swear their plan is to fuck up ur face as much as possible so u keep buying more products it’s a TRAP
2691 2018-03-19 18:24:49 I buy them. Probably would be healthier to make them, but I'm not the greatest cook.  They have flax seed and olive oil. Pretty decent.
2692 2018-03-19 18:24:48 there is no worse pain that that of dousing yourself in too much pepper mint oil

2695 2018-03-19 18:24:25 He took over such a shitshow to begin with, many could have done this. Economy, debts, military, incomes, mostly a result of oil/natural resources exports then profit redistribution. Supporting orth xtian revival not an achievement! His greatest strength is retaining power.

2697 2018-03-19 18:24:10 @zaidalattar2018 can you explain to me what a currency auction actually does? Specifically in Iraq.

They’re selling dollars to get dinars? Or the other way around? Why do it at all? Where are the entities that are bidding? Is it something about oil? W/ Venezuela doing it too

Mikhail Fridman, net worth: $15.1 billion.  
In addition to foreign oil & gas fields, the Russian tycoon has a myriad of int'l interests, such as a $3 BILLION investment in U.S. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS & a $200 million stake in UBER.
2705 2018-03-19 18:23:39 Basically, we’ll sell arms to anybody & don’t care who gets killed as long as they don’t threaten our oil or money pipelines.
2706 2018-03-19 18:23:34 Actually Oil is traded in USD. I don't get your point though. You realize Maduro has created petro in order to take advantage of his citizens as well as crpyto community. He is not contributing. Why is this not a good thing? Why would helping a dictator taking advantage be good?

2712 2018-03-19 18:22:48 Yeah, true. I like to sometimes just slice them into thin pieces and pan fry them these days. I have to use oil or it will dry up and  cake onto the pan. It sucks.

2717 2018-03-19 18:22:22 At approximately 1:15 PM today, Monday, March 19, 2018 there was an oil spill at West Elm Street, and Corson Street. The spill came from a tank truck vehicle. At this time the road has been closed to contain the spill.
2718 2018-03-19 18:22:15 Automobiles literally produce poison as they run!   Lethal poison from the tailpipes!      Not to mention the inestimable global misery created to secure oil fields.  You think they care about warming?

2724 2018-03-19 18:21:52 yeah but why does this look like an oil painting
2725 2018-03-19 18:21:36 There is far too much oil already discovered for the world to absorb their emissions and survive. Plastics is tiny versus fuel use.
2726 2018-03-19 18:21:27 Either oil goes back to sub $40 or energy equities double.
2727 2018-03-19 18:20:59 Oh, tasteless oil is any oil without much flavor, like canola, corn or a special kind of olive oil that is almost tasteless as well. The idea is to send calories into your body without you feeling any flavor. It changes something in the brain, sounds like witchcraft but it works.
2728 2018-03-19 18:20:58 I just came to get an oil change not to buy a carcan I have my keys back now

2747 2018-03-19 18:18:14 Patricia De Lille proving that DA & transparency are oil & water. At the same time refusing to answer @KarimaBrown
2748 2018-03-19 18:18:12 You cancel that...and I'll make sure that Procurement cancel the boiling oil method of repelling sales!!

2751 2018-03-19 18:18:03 It's not smoking it that cures cancer
Its the oils taken from it that are supposed 2 help with it
Smoking it increases ur chances as ur damaging ur lungs with inhalation of fumes
Even if U don't use tobacco
Its in tablet & oil form when people buy it for cancer 
Not a spliff 
2752 2018-03-19 18:18:00 Taylor going thru cost of teacher salaries in different regions: Southwest KS surprisingly high. She ties to growth in oil & gas industry, driving up avg. wages in community. #ksleg #ksed
2753 2018-03-19 18:17:38 You better use butter to make popcorn and not oil
2754 2018-03-19 18:17:36 I can’t wait to see how twitch handle the first time Logan oil violates TOS.
2755 2018-03-19 18:17:25 Oil sources are depleting, so it's obvius.
2756 2018-03-19 18:17:21 OK on foreign currency I always do 500 leverage, on oil and gold x1000 leverage, on crypto I play safe as the market is very much corrupt, mostly x5 or x1000 and only enter when all signals show bearish of bullish
2757 2018-03-19 18:17:16 BAD usa declaring unlawful #oil backed #venezuela petrocoij #cryptocurrency = whats $$ backed by eh #fed? o? NO #gold? NO NOTHING @federalreserve? "this note is #legal tender" NOT EVEN #trustme ;) #quackery++

2759 2018-03-19 18:17:07 FOR USA TO TAX US made GOODS & NOT TARIFF IMPORTS, may supply US consumers w/ cheap goods, but exports our neighbor's jobs as well!  To be totally dependent on imports for: Oil, Steel & aluminum= extremely unwise. What if suppliers become our enemies?  Military up creek!
2760 2018-03-19 18:17:04 Moshe being Moshe will make light of any situation. Today he reminded me of how we used to make “poached eggs” back in varsity. Not because we wanted to but because we didn’t have money to buy, as he puts it “frying oil”. Lol we laugh at it now but man was it tough.
2761 2018-03-19 18:16:57 It was a stoke of luck that my Dad ask me to go out on an offshore oil rig as a radio operator and ended up meeting a Geologist that encouraged me to pursue a degree in Geology.  Best thing I ever did .
2762 2018-03-19 18:16:52 It's interesting to see what "triggers" a nation's leadership to want to try banning a cryptoasset. America is pursuing fairly hands-off approach --- except when you start futzing around with oil, and by proxy, the petrodollar.
2763 2018-03-19 18:16:52 Commissioner Fisher shows Senate Finance at chart showing that state unrestricted general fund revenue would be over $7B if oil was $120 per barrel, going down to $1B at $20 per barrel. #akleg
2764 2018-03-19 18:16:49 Oil sources are depleting.
2765 2018-03-19 18:16:47 --I Trade Technicals only, but it is interesting to note that oil did not SELL-OFF with the overall Markets . Oil back above 64 is a Strong probability.
2766 2018-03-19 18:16:44 We are broke because of the failed policies of Gov Mary Fallin and a Gop majority in both house and senate. Our tax rates for oil & gas producers are a joke. Reduced from 8% to 3.2% along with an income tax reduction. Where did they think the revenue was going to come from?
2767 2018-03-19 18:16:42 Jesus. all this vinegar and oil in my salad giving me a headache
2768 2018-03-19 18:16:35 I guess a social warrior designed the generators and blades for wind. P S as a geologist I'm offended that someone thinks engineers found the gas and oil in the first place
2769 2018-03-19 18:16:33 I was trying to be responsible and squeeze an oil change into my break but it’s not been over an hour and I’m late back to work and it’s still not done

2771 2018-03-19 18:16:24 Meanwhile, trump tries to kill wind power by citing bird strikes—industry is working to reduce risk, while mining, oil, and Ag impacts are greater by orders of magnitude and nothing is being done!
2772 2018-03-19 18:16:17 I have to put on my game face every time I go to Jiffy Lube because I ONLY want an OIL CHANGE.

2776 2018-03-19 18:16:01 Maybe we should go round the 45,000 people who signed a petition to cease oil & gas exploration and take their phones & PCs off them. What do you think they're made of?
Next week we'll be complaining (again) thatNZ can't afford medical & other services that other countries can.
2777 2018-03-19 18:15:56 It must be weird eating food with no taste!!! Never heard of that oil!!!

2779 2018-03-19 18:15:37 I just got my oil changed in January and here I am again.  I drove 13,400 miles in 3 months.

2787 2018-03-19 18:14:54 Wondering if there is more to this thought? As the Trump policy has weakened the dollar it has led to higher oil prices. Hurts American consumers but helps....Putin and Russia as their economy is dependent on oil. Has anyone studied this @JoeNBC @jheil @mikebarnicle ?

2792 2018-03-19 18:14:33 Yeah. I’m getting the oil changed in my car and I legit called the place and was like ‘I’m outside where do I have to go?’  I did the same thing when I had to go to the doctors two weeks ago 
2793 2018-03-19 18:14:29 @potus  more earthquakes in the Midwest this weekend thanks to waste water injection from the oil industry. Ethanol does not cause earthquakes, oil slicks or dirty air/water. #RFSWORKS

2796 2018-03-19 18:14:10 @Badeggi Israel is dragging us into endless wars in the Middle East bur so are our own oil corporations and military contractors. It is just plain madness.
2797 2018-03-19 18:13:46 I think you are a bit of a chatterbox like me though.
2798 2018-03-19 18:13:43 Welcome to #petropruitt world of regulatory certainty, where big oil and Big Ag can be certain that they will not have to worry about epa oversight

2800 2018-03-19 18:13:36 If it’s natural remedies big pharmaceutical WILL attack it. No surprise. But some man made oil or pill will surely give you better results.

2809 2018-03-19 18:12:36 Do you realize how revolutionary "buy-side pricing of oil" would be?  Do you realize how bad "buy-side pricing of oil in non-USD" would be for the USD?  If we get "buy side pricing of oil", why won't we also get "buy-side pricing of gold"?
2810 2018-03-19 18:12:32 Bless ta very much :)

2813 2018-03-19 18:12:27 3rd and 8th game hurt. What was the oil pattern?
2814 2018-03-19 18:12:27 Why everyone in Austin smell like patchouli oil
2815 2018-03-19 18:12:26 50 million Americans didn't agree to have our personal information compromised for Putins oil giant Luke Oil. Now did we? See how your mole hill turned into a mountain. If only you did it without trying to aid Putin to help Trump. Now guess who's responsible for Seth Rich. YOU
2816 2018-03-19 18:12:25 I tell the lady I want mustard on my sandwich. She grabs the oil. One of those is not like the other.

2818 2018-03-19 18:12:02 #MotivationalMonday Quote! Have a quote? Share it!

“Don’t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.”  - John D. Rockefeller, Founder of Standard Oil Company
2819 2018-03-19 18:12:01 China surpassed UK and NL to become the second-largest destination for US crude oil exports in 2017, accounting for a fifth of the 527,000 b/d total year-over-year increase in foreign sales.
2820 2018-03-19 18:11:58 The use of *bonus* was just desperate scrambling when the oil price collapsed... It was essentially meaningless chuntering ...
2821 2018-03-19 18:11:43 Not like these ppl can't afford own security if they want to travel or anywhere else. Legislation needed to means test security costs
2822 2018-03-19 18:11:41 (But more seriously, I don't know how to think about markets where there's one store but a million different producers who sell at it. Like Amazon eBooks, or something. That feels different from Ma Bell and Standard Oil somehow...is it?)
2823 2018-03-19 18:11:40 Such an apt analogy. I could truly see Humpty Trumpty riding a across the Old West, selling snake oil as a cure for all ailments. In this case, the GOP in Congress and 35% of the people in this country, are hypnotized by his crass rhetoric into ignoring the destruction of America
2824 2018-03-19 18:11:28 My water bath leaked and ruined my sponge cake! Noooo! That's OK, I can try again tomorrow with a different pan. Two failed sponge cakes, but at least I know that butter worked instead of oil!

2830 2018-03-19 18:10:49 Iran has invaded and bombed nobody? Tell the people of Eastern Ghouta or Aleppo that. Or the Yemenis? Also ask yourself this, shy does Russia seek to protect the likes of Saddam and Assad? Is it altruism and love for their fellow man? Or oil and the arms trade?

2834 2018-03-19 18:10:21 Few would. Everything in front of you screams Flying Fortress. The level nose shows it isn't a tail dragger and you can work out the high shouldered wing and oil coolers on the engine nacelle sides which give them the unique oval of the B-24.
2835 2018-03-19 18:10:17  Trump putting an executive order to stop people buying Venezuelas oil #Crypto.  Anyone actually buying that scam coin is a fool.
2836 2018-03-19 18:10:14 My dad would just buy the big bags and roast them on the stove, over a hot coil, brush them with sesame oil and salt them himself.

2841 2018-03-19 18:09:55 Who is this senseless person spilling oil at our sea?
2842 2018-03-19 18:09:47 I've only been using it for a short time, but if anyone is interested, cbd oil has helped me sooo much regarding anxiety and self esteem issues. Would recommend x
2843 2018-03-19 18:09:46 Sure. But pricing & settlement-  particularly for forward contracts-are different functions. Key point with Shanghai is it is IMHO designed to be settled in oil & to lead to buy-side pricing of oil (which will remain in $ unit of account)
2844 2018-03-19 18:09:39 Salad Cream is different to dressing, it's a flour based sauce rather than an oil based dressing :P Sorry it's a british thing
2845 2018-03-19 18:09:38 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.

2848 2018-03-19 18:09:26 "some of his caucus wanted to boil people in oil but he said 'no that's not my style' instead he just cut taxes to the point where massive public service cuts impacting the vulnerable were made so give him his damn cookie"

2850 2018-03-19 18:08:55 @Budget We planned day trip to Tucson, and the oil light came on. When car was returned to PHX, we were told to wait in line (waited over an hour the first time) to get car replaced. If the car was given to us properly checked in the first place we would not be wasting a day.

2853 2018-03-19 18:08:24 So far, the #ShangriLaDiet seems to be helping me a lot! I do not care if it's placebo or not, all the times I did it, my appetite was reduced. Once a day, take 1 spoon of tasteless oil without being in contact with flavors 1 h after/before per 9 Kg you want to lose (max 3/day)
2854 2018-03-19 18:08:19 Pls check out the 10 largest producers of oil in d world .They r no 8.Production @ about 3.09mill barrel per day .

2856 2018-03-19 18:08:17 /Victor's a snake oil salesman. Wolcott's Wondrous Wares is a cross between some sort of new age gift shops, crystals and candles and the like as well as selling supplements and pills and mood boosters. All the stuff that has no scientific basis.

2860 2018-03-19 18:07:24 So far I’ve added a cleansing oil, foaming cleanser and facial gel serum. I started adding the no ordinary vitamin c powder to the serum too.
2861 2018-03-19 18:07:24 Ate burger with mushrooms and truffle oil. Mushroom with oil fell out. Rolled down shirt and pants. Left stains that won’t dry. Going home to work remote rest of the day...

2867 2018-03-19 18:06:05 Who wants Canada to be more like Venezuela??? Their oil industry is being destroyed and Turdeau  is working on ours.
2868 2018-03-19 18:06:01 I thought it meant you fell in a patch of poison ivy and needed the steroids to dry up the itchy oil your body produces when you fell in a patch of poison ivy, as I did once while in Northern MN. It doesn't mean that?
2869 2018-03-19 18:05:57 @DustinNickerson mind if we use “The Cult Essential Oil” to open our show this week? It’s great and fits well with our topic of cults.
2870 2018-03-19 18:05:46 We applaud when we clean up the oceans from oil but somehow people have something against the GREAT SOIL CLEAN UP in Canada....I don't get the logic!
2871 2018-03-19 18:05:26 It would also be good if you reiterated why Scotland is so precious to the union .... oil, whisky, tourism, fish etc etc etc just once say it once !!!
2872 2018-03-19 18:05:22 Not only do we supply the finest automotive oil and lubricants in the industry, but we can also carry out fleet surveys. It’s vital with new engines to ensure you are using the correct oil in your vehicles. Our expert engineers can aid this process 0330 055 5655
2873 2018-03-19 18:05:20 A bit like a pasta e fagioli recipe I do. Onions, celery, carrot, tomatoes, beans, pancetta & small pasta towards the end + olive oil & parmesan on top. Good 2-days-worth soup!
2874 2018-03-19 18:05:19 I’d rather dive in a tub of boiling oil than be in this class.
2875 2018-03-19 18:05:18 nightmares are usually due to your stress level when falling asleep, relax and possibly get some lavender oil to put on your neck before bed

2877 2018-03-19 18:05:10 Oh Adrian....the plot really does thicken here. You are going to be on overtime here with so much going on now.
2878 2018-03-19 18:05:08 As long as you know whats in the water you can design a system to clean it and it'd be safe. Just depends on what you want to take out. Oil field water is much worse that sewer water. It just turns people off to think they're drinking toilet water
2879 2018-03-19 18:04:54 Lawn mowers have sharpened blades, oil changes, and new oil and air filters where applicable; I'm ready for the 2018 mowing season.
2880 2018-03-19 18:04:53 The oil meme is getting lame
2881 2018-03-19 18:04:44 Is he going to give the U.S. mail the death penalty? The U.S. war in Afghanistan #1 and China #2 Opiate producers ,is the cause of the crisis. It's all about turf ,not oil.

2886 2018-03-19 18:03:50 .@pmiccic asks if the administration is pushing #akleg for its oil tax credit bond legislation. Fisher says state will calculate credits again: "We have been clear with the credit holders the forecast we had in the fall ... would change in the spring (and affect credits)."
2887 2018-03-19 18:03:50 I hate the way he gutted State, but we've learned that that was driven by Gingrich and Trump more than Tillerson.

I think he basically had an impossible situation. I almost feel bad for him...almost...then I remember his original motive of an oil deal and stop feeling bad. 
2888 2018-03-19 18:03:50 Baby oil!!! Look and smell good at the same time.
2889 2018-03-19 18:03:39 Correct!! I guess i can now reveal more! The only clues in this image were the unique -24 engine oil cooler design and angle of the nose showing it wasn't a tail dragger.
2890 2018-03-19 18:03:27 Well that's not a surprise is it?  Its always been about killing the capitalism side of oil and gas.  More government control.  More subservience of the population.  Socialist will tell us where to live how to live what to earn what to pay in taxes and what we can keep.
2891 2018-03-19 18:03:26 But, according to him, that isn't "worth" talking about.  But holding the screws to big oil? Now there's some real money there.

I'm sure a 40% retroactive wholesale tax on big oil would have them clamoring to do business here too.  Just give up some of them "greedy profits!"
2892 2018-03-19 18:03:20 Hope to see you when you get back miss. Not looking forward to the eagle oil tho 
2893 2018-03-19 18:03:14 Michael Blooberg talked about renewables cheaper than dirty coal. Gas and oil are not renewable, but better than coal. With gas pipeline added, the Northeast can benefit from gas at a reliable price.
2894 2018-03-19 18:02:59 Orthodontist, registration sticker, oil change, gas & car wash all in one day  feeling accomplished. Now let’s see if I can get all my laundry done lol

2896 2018-03-19 18:02:54 Just marinated my lunch meat for tomorrow and frankly I'm a bit shocked that it took me over 1 hour to cut & caramelize an onion, mix it up with oil, apple vinegar, honey and a bunch of freshly grounded spices
+ messily putting it in bags with the meat and cleaning up everything
2897 2018-03-19 18:02:45 That ermine-gland oil in the other night?
2898 2018-03-19 18:02:42 So my car dealership is about to reimburse me a fat ass check ... I’m supposed to have free oil changes bc I have a maintenance plan and y’all be charging me 35$ per oil change ... LOL RUN ME MY MONEY
2899 2018-03-19 18:02:38 That too.
*Note to self: Buy a lot of baby oil*

2901 2018-03-19 18:02:35 Chemicals in Lavender Oil and Tea Tree Oil contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals that activate estrogen-receptor alpha and may contribute to prepubertal gynecomastia, says J. Tyler Ramsey of @NIEHS #ENDO2018
2902 2018-03-19 18:02:32 When I was a kid, the girls used to put baby oil and iodine in a spray bottle and baste themselves with it.   There was sunscreen but the cool kids didn’t use it.

2906 2018-03-19 18:02:22 Funny thing about Tillerson is that we went in under the recommendation of Cheney and Codi Rice to fix the Exxon deal w Russia.

So not necessarily Russia allied, but willing to work with them to get the deal done. However, once he got the full picture, he chose country over oil.
2907 2018-03-19 18:02:16 First read it as Christmas Oil and was like wtf is thst.

2911 2018-03-19 18:01:52 Coastal communities have been sold out and had NO extra thrown at them unlike north east after de manufacturing. We are an island it’s our advantage FFS you can’t even be a ski instructor in the alps unless you’re French. We stuck up for Kuwait when Iraq stoke their oil....

*Checks oil*

"It's fine"

"Will you put some in just to be safe?"

"Putting some in when it doesn't need it is the opposite of safe."

"Yes, but will you just put some in anyway?"

"No"

"Why not?"


2917 2018-03-19 18:01:43 Got olbas oil in my eye
2918 2018-03-19 18:01:38 Well, when people expect to stop making money from oil and gas then - yes - they will close it.
2919 2018-03-19 18:01:22 Do you have a favorite herb or essential oil?
2920 2018-03-19 18:01:19 I'm lazy to oil mine coz of the washing part but let me start using that shampoo and I'll let you know

2923 2018-03-19 18:00:59 Worst oil rigger in the history of oil riggers
2924 2018-03-19 18:00:28 Slightly concerned about my intake of these. Add reading over the weekend that lavender oil (very useful for burns amingst otner things) may also have some similar affects and I'm perturbed. Mrs. W on the other hand delighted!
2925 2018-03-19 18:00:27 All I really want is peanut oil for frying. Is that to much to ask? Oh and green beans for the Seder.
2926 2018-03-19 18:00:18 Transportation, maybe, in that OPEC controls 73% of oil reserves (though only 44% of production)? Housing supply is determined by a local cartel but that's not what most people think of when they say "monopoly".
2927 2018-03-19 18:00:17 Nothing exposes the hollowness of the oligarchy more than the desperate and cringe-inducing last grabs at wealth and power before the planet killing oil based economy collapses at the hands of ever increasing knowledge of climate change cause and effect.

2929 2018-03-19 18:00:13 My co-worker expressed concern the other day that barely educated 20 somethings were no longer able to earn $150k in the oil industry. I wasn't very sympathetic.
2930 2018-03-19 18:00:12 If oil is settled in more than 1 currency, then oil exporters have free market to decide which currency to settle in, based on each currency's fundamentals (BoP, trade realities w/oil exporter, external debt, etc.)  USD looks worst in world on virtually all of those metrics...
2931 2018-03-19 18:00:08 Yes but then it had a protective layer of coal dust and oil on it - think health & safety!xx
2932 2018-03-19 18:00:04 OIL DIFF: 4.09 -> 4.15

2934 2018-03-19 18:00:00 "The cost of kerosene is a poverty trap. Amongst the poorest populations, kerosene alone consumes up to 30% of their income."
In a nutshell, this is the problem with thinking LNG is any kind of answer. The poorest populations would switch dependence on foreign oil to foreign gas.

2939 2018-03-19 17:59:34 I wish they tried  Simon with him and Hags, if not Rust. I think they can move the puck beautifully together and seems like Simon can one time the puck pretty well, so they can work. But it would be Horny so more oil and water action 
2940 2018-03-19 17:59:30 Let's face it,  the republicans set up EVERYTHING to lose so that they could win a smooth road for big oil.

Take our lumps and put up with the mango mussolini for 2 more years.  Or a tandem jfk solution.  Immortalized for posterity might be worth stabilization.  Holy cow

2950 2018-03-19 17:57:23 Sen. MacKinnon says she supports oil tax credits based on the formula the state has been using -- the same position as @AkGovBillWalker. The House wants to use a lower calculation. Lawyers say the law is ambiguous -- but administration's opinion carries some legal weight. #akleg
2951 2018-03-19 17:57:09 Dumb question: if Lukoil is basically Putin’s oil company why is your state contracting with them to run the Garden State service plazas?
2952 2018-03-19 17:56:53 @Bourdain i've been putting truffle oil on stuff and every time i do it i hear you in some radio interview talking about how fucking sick you are of truffle oil. just thought you should know

2960 2018-03-19 17:56:28 Excellent presentation on the endocrine disruptive potential of lavender and tea tree oil by @ramseyjtyler at #ENDO2018. Keeping this in mind when shopping for body lotions next time.
2961 2018-03-19 17:56:26 Changed D3 brand bcz cldn't figure out why the drops didn't make D3 soar. Wondered whether D3 less effective in oil base. Assume once levels go up, easier to rely on sun/food. Much research on northern climes in U.S. , so geography/sunlight key. Not all locales created D3-equal.
2962 2018-03-19 17:56:21 My coworker got me CBD oil , I smoked it last night and fell asleep like a baby , didn’t wake up in pain:) good shit dude
2963 2018-03-19 17:56:01 Natural bergamot oil adds a delicious flavor! It's also a natural mood booster since it contains alpha-pinene and limonene, compounds that act as natural antidepressants!
2964 2018-03-19 17:55:54 The anti oil brigade used to argue that we were going to run out of it, that proved incorrect. Now they have had to change their argument to  global warming, I wonder how that will turn out.

2966 2018-03-19 17:55:48 if we remove the enviro side of things and decided as a country that we want energy security for the next 200 years, the oil interests would rail against the idea.

2970 2018-03-19 17:55:27 We’re starting with the largest income tax cut in MB history and a small business tax cut. It’s pretty clearly laid out in the budget. Cuts will continue, including a one point PST cut. They’re cuts for Manitobans, not oil companies, so I understand your dismissal of them

2974 2018-03-19 17:54:33 Had a dream that I had built a panhead and it ended blowing a head gasket and I was covered in oil
2975 2018-03-19 17:54:33 Well at the time they needed money and oil as simple as that.
2976 2018-03-19 17:54:20 OIL 1H volatility is still ON FULL and appears to be splitting use both high and low as it tests within the bounds of 1D WEDGE pattern. 15M closes above 20MA and then GAPS up and is moving higher. Is there enough to break out above WEDGE? WATCH
2977 2018-03-19 17:54:17 unfortunately boss, otherwise try the avocado oil instead. 
Do let me know how whichever option you choose treats you.

2980 2018-03-19 17:54:11 Trump is apparently "banning" the Petro, Venezuela's crypto. I really don't understand what people saw in this scam. It's supposedly pegged to oil so it's not going to moon unless oil does! You might as well just invest in oil CFDs and avoid dealing with the shady Vnzn govt...
2981 2018-03-19 17:54:10 Imagine you had to buy car ins for car washes, oil changes, and window tinting. So why all inclusive health ins? Be #selfish and think NO!

2987 2018-03-19 17:53:49 I'd agree if the brain drain on Venezuela left him with anyone who still knew how to get oil out of the ground in large, quality, quantities.

They also need to find a seller of miners who isn't subject to UN sanctions that are coming. Not an easy job.

3003 2018-03-19 17:51:26 My oil painting professor is retiring this year and I’ve only had him for half a semester and I’m sad. I love it when people have that effect on you. You barely know them but you already enjoy their company and personality because they’re just such good people.
3004 2018-03-19 17:51:25 I don't know about that. Presto Manning's Dad and the Social Credit were hard core social cons and even tried to have their own money. As accurate as your statements are, the RW lunacy goes back before finding oil.
3005 2018-03-19 17:51:19 It's effing freezing in my (unheated - no money for oil!) kitchen - and bathroom! Brr!

3006 2018-03-19 17:51:01 and a Russian Oil company connection?
3007 2018-03-19 17:50:51 When the price of oil slumped in 2016 that was sanctions on Russia this is all to get Russia’s oil prices dropped n USA make more money of us keep it in the family
3008 2018-03-19 17:50:50 Your MCM runs away so fast after throwing in one potato in oil while deep frying them..
3009 2018-03-19 17:50:46 Yes. Those that don’t read the slide. The post isn’t about economic growth rate. It’s about oil production.
3010 2018-03-19 17:50:40 3 months if CDB oil from cannabis flower (not hemp) did more for my mother's cancer than 2.5 years of chemo treatments. This may not be the case for everyone but please consider it an option. Western cancer care is debilitatingly expensive for many families.

3012 2018-03-19 17:50:21 I just spent $80 on CBD oil, fingers crossed that it works.

3016 2018-03-19 17:50:02 เราเศร้าอ่ะ เห้อม

3019 2018-03-19 17:49:56 @harbhajan_singh who're you to suggest @ICC to ban @BCBTigers for some matches? Before throwing a comment you should oil yourself. And #Gavaskar is an another brilliant unsmart. You are so....

3021 2018-03-19 17:49:40 Blocked US citizens participating in any "crypto" based in Venezuela..

($PETRO, the oil backed governmental piece of shit that was an attempt to save its crumbling economy)
3022 2018-03-19 17:49:40 The war against Saddam was to stop him from selling oil for Euros/Gold.
3023 2018-03-19 17:49:31 คิดมากจริงๆอ่ะแหละ
3024 2018-03-19 17:49:30 Oil it  I actually ordered shampoo from a girl who does aroma and mixes stuff for your problem areas. If it works I'll let you know and you can try find someone in your area

3027 2018-03-19 17:49:16 What have you ever done for the EU? Help when there is oil to catch?
3028 2018-03-19 17:49:12 Being honest. Not pretending that Brexit will achieve a fishing nirvana, accepting and negotiating quotas and environmental standards, getting on with the day job. Ruth Davidson looks a lot like a snake oil merchant right now. Same old Tories, same old lies. From Ted Heath onward
3029 2018-03-19 17:49:08 Russia wants to take over Syria so it can control any oil pipelines running from Arabia to the Mediterranean. The war was a good excuse.
3030 2018-03-19 17:49:06 I don't know if they're safe, but they are useless snake oil.
3031 2018-03-19 17:49:06 Horse people said the same thing when cars were developed. Trains and boat businesses complained about planes. Realize that oil and coal jobs will become renewable energy jobs. Things change, people complain, things turn out okay.
3032 2018-03-19 17:48:39 its nominally socialist, thats not the discussion. 

The Discussion is about the rare context in which Venezuela has carved itself into.  An oil rich, USA oppositional South American nation - the only of which (now the Cuba has bowed down) to attempt to stand with sovereignty
3033 2018-03-19 17:48:37 Sure, there is no deep state or crooked DEMS disrupting the people's work.  Truth is an antiseptic.  We need an oil reserves worth to scrub this corrupt government clean.
3034 2018-03-19 17:48:24 Imagine the benefits for NZ of not continuing to spend billions per year importing oil for transport. Electrification of transport means we can generate our own renewable transport energy from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal. No wonder oil cos hate it!
3035 2018-03-19 17:47:57 Get my oil change and pay this carnote .
3036 2018-03-19 17:47:50 lots of proof that the iraq war was blood for oil though; carpet bombing falleujah by a general that now enjoys a powerful administrative position is interesting in itself.
3037 2018-03-19 17:47:33 ไม่ได้อยากเป็นความผิดพลาดของใครสะหน่อย..
3038 2018-03-19 17:47:32 Designer shit spoil ya. Rub you down with the oil.
3039 2018-03-19 17:47:30 The eco terrorist would lose their minds , if they realized EVERYTHING they own is made with oil . Inconvenient thruth .
3040 2018-03-19 17:47:22 American Oil Memes!!!!
3041 2018-03-19 17:47:19 With 100k, I can start a palm oil business. From villages to town there big money inside the business.
3042 2018-03-19 17:47:14 I got hair oil on my work chair had to use spot remover to get it out lol 
3043 2018-03-19 17:47:13 ทำไมมันเศร้าแบบนี้

3045 2018-03-19 17:46:59 @Take5_OilChange yall put a faulty oil filter on my car and almost locked my engine up smh
3046 2018-03-19 17:46:57 It can sink itself, slide under large platforms and rise back up. Think oil platforms, even other ships.
3047 2018-03-19 17:46:53 That oil has a nice color to it!
3048 2018-03-19 17:46:52 @badassbeardcare before i order some beard oil. does it work for black men? DM
3049 2018-03-19 17:46:48 Talk is cheap.

What about some legislation or something? Isn't that what you're there to do? Or has the legislative branch been slashed out of the Constitution so that its only purpose is to gin up lifetime pensions and healthcare for snake oil salesmen?
3050 2018-03-19 17:46:47 อยากให้มันนานกว่านี้ แต่คงจะไม่แล้วอ่ะมั้ง
3051 2018-03-19 17:46:43 I’m trying to justify spending $1000 on a doula (but she also includes a birth photography session) when there’s bills to pay and my benz needs a $59583853 tune up and oil change and I want my boobs done next year too and mama has n o  j o b so yeah who wants feet pics for $200
3052 2018-03-19 17:46:41 Don't worry she serve Jim a good dose of Lamp oil
3053 2018-03-19 17:46:28 Why are oil corporations receiving subsidies. The enormous tax cuts should be enough. No corporations should receive subsidies any longer.
3054 2018-03-19 17:46:27 When was the very last time you checked and changed your vehicle oil? 
#Car #CarCare #Warranty #Oil
3055 2018-03-19 17:46:17 We can never have enough Earl Grey when it uses natural bergamot oil!
3056 2018-03-19 17:46:13 ทั้งคิดถึงทั้งเสียใจ พูดไม่ออกอ่ะ
3057 2018-03-19 17:46:12 What would eagle oil do? 
3058 2018-03-19 17:45:59 @KayBurleySky marina litvinenko just talked about #dritymoney and where did all oil money go not to people @SkyNews yes she's correct the people of Scotland understand that only to well #Westminster #CORRUPTION
3059 2018-03-19 17:45:59 Chicks be in whole r’ships wit dudes who can’t change a tire, swap out a battery, &/or check a oil stick.. dawg lol
3060 2018-03-19 17:45:57 Listening to alt hype on race and genetics is like listening to a scientist in the pocket of the oil industry... trying to discredit climate change.

Or an anti Vaxer saying that vaccines cause autism.
3061 2018-03-19 17:45:57 เสียใจนะ ที่คิดอะไรไว้เยอะแยะ แต่สุดท้ายก็ไม่ได้ทำ
3062 2018-03-19 17:45:50 lol’ing at all the products he used/wears that were made possible by oil / oil byproducts.
3063 2018-03-19 17:45:47 Other ships? Oil platforms?
3064 2018-03-19 17:45:32 อีก6วันก้ครบเดือนแล้วที่เป็นแบบนี้
3065 2018-03-19 17:45:32 Let the lamp oil work on the Wharf Dwog
3066 2018-03-19 17:45:19 A mint/essential oil candle may have been the best purchase I’ve made in a while 
3067 2018-03-19 17:45:12 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
3068 2018-03-19 17:45:01 You can make your poll say anything, Vancouver doesn’t need your dirty oil
3069 2018-03-19 17:44:55 Not many people involved, halpens in few communities. Suspect we could say the same of forrestry, agriculture, crofting, mining, hydro-electric, docklands, refinering oil, fashion, designing, etc......
Not much to be bothered about, by your calculations.
3070 2018-03-19 17:44:49 Ok will order that for my face next. Thank you so much, I will say bye to Coconut oil.
3071 2018-03-19 17:44:45 Indeed! Both Tories and Labour wer4e aware of this secret report back then, Heath set up the report just before the 1974 GE which makes it more sickening, both these unionist parties shafting Scotland & depriving us of our right to know what our maritime sea full of oil was worth
3072 2018-03-19 17:44:26 I feel like Glossier is just 2 parts baby oil and 1 part chicken grease in a tube prove me wrong
3073 2018-03-19 17:44:21 The oil giants like Russia and Saudi arabi are just waiting for the entire 2million  a day Venezuela barrels to come off the market
3074 2018-03-19 17:44:19 However, oil equities tanked much more than oil. What is wrong here?
3075 2018-03-19 17:44:14 Looks like an obvious attempt at ripping off oil sheikhs.
3076 2018-03-19 17:44:06 It's pretty great! Did you know it's also a mood booster -  natural bergamot  essential oil contains alpha-pinene and limonene, compounds that act as natural antidepressants!
3077 2018-03-19 17:44:02 Hahaha I hear this!

Yesterday I fried my cheese sandwich in leftover bacon/sausage oil. That was a new low for me .
3078 2018-03-19 17:43:59 The snake oil.... It's apparently genetic 
3079 2018-03-19 17:43:56 I love cocoa butter & coconut oil.
3080 2018-03-19 17:43:54 socialism isnt the venezuelan crisis.
a greedy heavy healed regime leader is certainly a strong impact
but even moreso, its about their national oil reserves 
and unwillingness to cater to US/ western capital dictation
3081 2018-03-19 17:43:52 Ah the hypocrisy of it all! These Arabs have no democracy, behead enemies, give their women little rights etc but because they have money and oil they are America's best friend.
3082 2018-03-19 17:43:51 Usa backed Kurds took %80 of Syrian oil reserves , and from now they are saying it is Kurdish, and are spreading their ideology in it, and they are calling it by a #Kurdish name, and they will not stop there, they want to take over all of Iraq & Jordan border .
3083 2018-03-19 17:43:40 Yea, where they’re half naked with oil all over them. There’s a difference. You only know the difference if you’ve been in this position.
3084 2018-03-19 17:43:20 in a pooled oil on wet asphalt mood tbh

3086 2018-03-19 17:43:18 if you put oil and water in the same container, is the water wet with oil? or is the oil wet with water?

3088 2018-03-19 17:43:05 Every technology dies, adapt or become obsolete. I worked for 7 years in oil research for Esso (Exxon), I was "downsized". I turned out okay, because of education. Coal miners can go to school and get better educations, I have no sympathy for them.
3089 2018-03-19 17:42:54 How very fascist of you. US only wants their oil in the end. Who cares if their Socialist, they’re no threat to us.
3090 2018-03-19 17:42:42 So we are meant to take the words of an ex oil firm man about his downers on EV’s? Big oil trying desperately to cling to the hope that diesel and petrol will survive......nowt like a bit of balanced journalism

3094 2018-03-19 17:42:16 Are you a climate change denier? If so, you're denying a broad scientific concensus.  The world is moving away from fossil fuels & fossil fools like yourselves apologizing for some of the most nrg-intensive, water-using and polluting oil production on Earth will soon be defunct.
3095 2018-03-19 17:41:55 The whistling noise, or so I’m told, is the crank mounted centrifugal oil breather. Either way, it sounds great. #triumph #triple #955i

3097 2018-03-19 17:41:49 Damn! Matt, I just got "Old guy'd" By the oil change service man.

"That's how you reset the oil light, okkkkkkk???" (The tone goes up at the end).

Or was it "Dumb-guy'd"?
3098 2018-03-19 17:41:41 my intel is they're using different fry oil and not as good as the mothership.
3099 2018-03-19 17:41:37 Yeah you guys are funded and ran by big oil. You are literally trying to destroy salmon habitat. Standing for the Chuitna Coal mine?!! COAL?!! It’s 2018. Coal is dead and it will ruin our rivers with its byproducts of mining. Seriously you people should have to live within
3100 2018-03-19 17:41:32 Let all oil manufacturing countries enjoy for next 5 years. It includes USA. The demand will fall by 50%. Electrical n driverless cars including Uber.
3101 2018-03-19 17:41:29 I somehow managed to get my oil changed, get my radio somewhat fixed, and went to get my passport all while dying of some type of sickness happy Monday
3102 2018-03-19 17:41:21 There’s lip oil matte lipstick a bag and a eyeshadow palette. I’d probably just get the eyeshadow palette and try it out
3103 2018-03-19 17:41:18 Someone take my camaro to get an oil change and tire rotation. I don't feel like going to get it done
3104 2018-03-19 17:41:17 wtf? emitting greenhouse gas is half the fun!
3105 2018-03-19 17:41:15 Don't give a crap about the bloated oil companies.
3106 2018-03-19 17:40:57 Last night, I was watching @60Minutes which featured an interview with Saudi prince MBS. At one point, the Crown Prince parenthetically mentioned a $3bn investment they had made in Uber and my thought immediately was, "Stick to oil, Sheikh"
3107 2018-03-19 17:40:55 Oregano oil is great stuff, but mostly for external use. It tastes so bad that you'll think it's a cruel practical joke.
3108 2018-03-19 17:40:54 เสมอมา
3109 2018-03-19 17:40:46 I also believe one of the reasons corruption is rampant in Nigeria is because we do not think the money the politician is stealing is my money (I.e., my taxes) we feel it is our money (i.e., oil money).
3110 2018-03-19 17:40:42 That's the problem, Gowdy.  He can't do it! My God, the fact that you guys are just catching up to the fact that Trump is a con artist, snake oil salesman, carnival barker and criminal is just mind boggling. What else have you guys let slide on your watch?

3113 2018-03-19 17:40:18 Of the approximately 1.2 million barrels per day that goes though the strait, about 500,000 barrels of mainly Alaskan oil (similar to diluted oil sands crude) move south to the Seattle area.

3118 2018-03-19 17:39:48 A fun thing that you kinda had to be there for was they were gonna call it "Operation Iraqi Liberation," but it turns out that is an acronym for OIL so it became "Freedom"

3127 2018-03-19 17:38:33 I genuinely cannot stand getting my car serviced. I been here for 2 hours for an oil change & tire rotation. Then they want to come up and talk about there has been a recall on your key chime........

3130 2018-03-19 17:38:26 These Oil Memes  
3131 2018-03-19 17:38:15 i recommend oil pastels and a blank paper. the permanency of oil pastels forces you to go along with whatever you did
3132 2018-03-19 17:38:15 Why did we invade Iraq?

To what ends?

Was it to destroy a country to steal resources as a payment for business contracts? 

My ex worked for Bechtel during that time. They smuggled out oil, gold artifacts. And how is Iraq now?
3133 2018-03-19 17:38:14 NHTSB says auto 102 deaths daily in 2016..Is this store stopping sales of Oil & Batteries?
3134 2018-03-19 17:37:56 I used coconut oil for my face mixed with water after washing my face, and I ended up with a rash. NOT COOL!

3140 2018-03-19 17:37:01 Didn't certain oil companies get more favorable deals post-war? Seems like a fair trade-off, right?

3144 2018-03-19 17:36:17 I just read that after you wash less for a little bit your scalp stops producing as much oil. So imma try it out lol
3145 2018-03-19 17:36:17 they can be total divas  also, try fish oil! It’s good for their skin, heart, kidneys + joints! Not the most pleasant dog breath, but super beneficial lol and eggs!

3152 2018-03-19 17:35:26 Yep, this is why they're so active in hacking and Facebook manipulation: it's way cheaper than tanks and the ROI is much better. They're not a financial power unless oil prices are high.
3153 2018-03-19 17:35:23 "DMAU doses of 400 mg, formulated as powder in capsule or in castor oil, suppress serum T to near castrate levels." WHAT THE FUCK????
3154 2018-03-19 17:35:04 Also try using black jamacian caster oil on the bald spot.
3155 2018-03-19 17:35:01 If you could drive your car an entire year without changing the oil, increase its life and save money, why wouldn't you??? Ask me for more details.
3156 2018-03-19 17:34:57 The bike seems to have a bit of a thirst for oil. Annoyingly, I can't figure out where it's all going.

3160 2018-03-19 17:34:20 Joy got back home once the car was repaired and took a quick shower since she was filled with dirty oil. Then she puts some jeans and a shirt on before putting her jacket on. She doesn't wear that much make up. She puts some perfume on for god knows why and she drives to Jake's.

3162 2018-03-19 17:34:11 I love all tgibgs coconut.  I even use coconut oil for... basically everything.  Cuts, bruises, bite relief... even as a face wash
3163 2018-03-19 17:34:02 I know how hard you try.

3176 2018-03-19 17:32:37 You can make them more interesting. I am currently frying courgettes, mushrooms & peppers in a bit of olive oil for lunch. It's yum. Sometimes I do a mushroom omelette.
3177 2018-03-19 17:32:36 Thank you for the suggestions on my latest video! Gonna remove my makeup with coconut oil.. silly puffy eyes...
3178 2018-03-19 17:32:18 Okay, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world but more then 80% of its population live in poverty. Wealth of resources alone don’t guarantee economic prosperity. But let’s agree to disagree Jr, time will tell. A good evening to you.

3183 2018-03-19 17:31:47 Oh please.

Talk about form over substance.

Trump's GOP is an amalgam of Oil & Gas, NRA, Big Bank, Defense and Manufacturing Market Players. He's the first President "promoting" inflation and these suggestions provide a pretext for price manipulation.

3185 2018-03-19 17:31:22 In a certain country with huge crude oil reserves, in the coast of West Africa. Statistics has shown that every Friday, men withdraw huge sums of money and on Monday morning, women deposits huge sums in like manner.

3187 2018-03-19 17:31:14 I want petrol-diesel to progressively 10x in price. It is poisoning the environment, wrecks our health, causes wars, etc. There's nothing good about it. If burning oil in an open fire to heat your house was dirt cheap but poisoned you would you still do it? Of course not.

3193 2018-03-19 17:30:36 Oil changes are by far the most pointless and annoying things to spend money on
3194 2018-03-19 17:30:35 Emissions trading fraud, river water quality, oil and gas exploration, Pike River mining on DOC land, MEPS, bio-fuel subsidy, Oteake Park, prospecting in national parks, home insulation scheme, public transport, DOC funding, ECAN, ...+ many more failures
3195 2018-03-19 17:30:34 I worked in oil industry in the 70s in N Scotland- a local man told me that people like me (from England) were referred to as FEBs by the locals - the only repeatable word being for the E-English. I witnessed a similar incident in Leeds as a student. There are haters everywhere

3205 2018-03-19 17:28:57 Really depends on the play, well depth and oil cut of the well. No one well is similar. But many wells in the scoop and stack are easily 80% water, and maybe 5% sellable crude. And not lite sweet at that. So the spot price can be much lower than WTI.
3206 2018-03-19 17:28:51 Patently false claim, brought to you by an oil and gas lobbying arm. In PA the promise lower gas prices and jobs and neither happens . They bring in workers from out of state and ship the gas overseas. They create sinkholes and leaks.

3208 2018-03-19 17:28:41 (1/4) Let's remember that when @cathmckenna and @TransMtn say Kinder Morgan will raise "almost $50 billion" in gov't revenue & "create lots of jobs" this assumes an oil price well above $100/barrel, and comes from questionable input-output modelling by @Conferenceboard
3209 2018-03-19 17:28:40 Simple: the Alberta oil and tarsands industries are owned (or in a feudal relationship with) Americans, so why would they complain?
3210 2018-03-19 17:28:22 Same. I just started taking a fish oil pill to ease it.

3214 2018-03-19 17:27:29 I don't think "staying the course on oil" is a very clear vision.

There's always the cognitive bias to stick with what you know, but the evidence is overwhelming that doing that is the worst thing possible.
3215 2018-03-19 17:27:28 This response reminds me of Tony Hayward, BP's CEO, saying "I just want my life back," as gallons of oil was spewing into the Gulf Coast. #DeepwaterHorizon
3216 2018-03-19 17:27:25 If history has taught you nothing you don't mess with oil.

3284 2018-03-19 17:19:43 Maybe because in the 50s the US and UK plotted to overthrown a popular prime minister who was planning on nationalize the oil and gas which was bad news for their oil tycoon friends and give absolute power to a puppet monarch, reason why people resorted to a religious extremist..

3296 2018-03-19 17:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
3297 2018-03-19 17:18:39 I miss the smell of oil paints
3298 2018-03-19 17:18:36 In my fridge  damn autocorrect
But technically I am gonna pan fry the scallops quick and have them with a very green salad - steamed green beans, avocado and coriander, with dressing of very spicy nuoc cham with avocado oil.

3303 2018-03-19 17:17:33 Imagine this as an oil on canvas. Stunning!
3304 2018-03-19 17:17:28 get the oil! You can use it for so much. If you get the capsules you’ll probably end up breaking them for the oil
3305 2018-03-19 17:17:28 ありがとうございます！

3309 2018-03-19 17:16:48 Prior to public review of several National Monuments, an email was sent by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)'s office to the DOI suggesting how to open oil and gas deposits in Bears Ears. Following Zinke’s review, the suggested changes in that email were followed almost exactly.
3310 2018-03-19 17:16:44 do u ingest the oil or the capsules?

3313 2018-03-19 17:16:37 Absolutely. Cannot believe how long I was consuming Canola oil. Probably shaved 20 yrs off my life already. Peace, my friend.

3316 2018-03-19 17:16:23 We should tell everyone to be careful on follow back. I had an oil company bot sneak in on my follow back yesterday. Look before we leap. I unfollowed and immediately he disappeared. Nobody is that fast.
3317 2018-03-19 17:16:21 Trying everything to starve ppl to death. All in the name of oil. Evil bastards
3318 2018-03-19 17:16:19 Ukraine Crimea region is sufficient reason for Russian aggression as Russia was crippled without Crimea.
Now has durect access to Mediterranean sea via Crimea.
Dustributes Ukraine oil global distribution to North Korea via sea.
Oil pipeline distribution to eastern Russia.
3319 2018-03-19 17:16:12 What kind of bugs? If they are ticks, I vote with your husband.   Can you spray peppermint oil on them? I'd be worried that they multiply in the vacuum bag.
3320 2018-03-19 17:15:54 @eczemaxpert tried Neem oil for my son and it’s working amazingly!!

3323 2018-03-19 17:15:47 Excited to get my car worked on today. Oil change, new brake pads, air conditioning fixed and a full inspection 
3324 2018-03-19 17:15:32 You get a little drunk and want to do a little art I get it but maybe use the many house paints that we have instead of my good oil and acrylic paint......also maybe ask first?
3325 2018-03-19 17:15:09 U sound like the Jews that hated Jesus. They were disgusted & appalled by his very existence. When Jesus went n2 the temple & thru out the $changers & snake oil salesman & told them 2 F off- the Jews boiled over w hatred & wantd him dead bc he was uncovering their evil ways. 
3326 2018-03-19 17:15:08 …
Likewise, the threats from immigrants, Mexican workers and people of the Muslim faith are either grossly exaggerated or dead wrong.

Ditto harm from global trade.

So Trump offers remedies like a quack physician’s snake oil. We need health but his stuff kills you.
3327 2018-03-19 17:14:46 But it would be a undervalued ICO which can go up and HODL! , especially with oil prices (I am kidding)
3328 2018-03-19 17:14:33 Maybe go protest cows and chickens. They do more damage to the environment than oil and gas will ever do

3330 2018-03-19 17:14:16 Supertweeters, coalescing drops of oil
3331 2018-03-19 17:14:13 Yeah. Remember when Coca Cola was like "we did research, SUGAR IS SOOOO GOOD FOR YOU"
oh and Exxon "we studied climate change and altered our data, OIL FOR EVERYONE, IT'S FINE"
You're the same idiots that don't trust pharmaceutical companies research.

3334 2018-03-19 17:13:45 @jimcramer hey Jim, just a quick question for you. ¿What oil/gas stocks would you consider are the best to invest at this time?
3335 2018-03-19 17:13:43 

Working on my mower today.  I need to replace the oil sump gasket.  Tired of it leaking all over the garage floor.  
3336 2018-03-19 17:13:35 Finally got my act together and ordered some great oil and butter from @detroitgrooming this morning. This beard thing is real, and I want to be looking good!

3338 2018-03-19 17:13:26 I did this last month and turmeric and cbd oil helped a lot
3339 2018-03-19 17:13:20 So you would still have Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Bell Telephones, both obvious monopolies?
3340 2018-03-19 17:12:35 @PlainLauraJane Hi. The servicing schedule is designed to keep your car in good working order. It has to be serviced every year or 10,000 miles (whichever comes first). Things like oil need changing regularly, even if the car hasn't done many miles. Thanks.
3341 2018-03-19 17:12:16 I guess this sets the stage for a US invasion so we can go after all that oil.
3342 2018-03-19 17:12:12 I am. So be happy because they are swimming in oil?
3343 2018-03-19 17:12:09 Yes things are correlated but if you've seen enough liquidations, correlations do not matter. Flood gates open they sell, no regard for rates, dollar, oil etc... It is what is is. Sometimes no need to over analyze move.

3345 2018-03-19 17:11:59 Great news for @UKOGlistedonAIM  it means they can focus 100% on getting the oil out and proving commercial viability #ukog
3346 2018-03-19 17:11:51 the obvious similarity of a deceived westerner by Isis and YPG/PKK. One was deceived with religious belief, the other was deceived in the name of nationalist socialism. Both parties are actually serving US destabilizing middle east and get the oil wealth #afrin #ypg #USPolitics
3347 2018-03-19 17:11:46 Comey, the Poster Boy for the Corrupt Obama Regeim is a Consummate Liar, Fraud  and Snake Oil Salesman.
3348 2018-03-19 17:11:42 He is protecting naive USA firms & individuals from loosing money in shady Petro-Crypto fraud. Can't be backed by oil in the ground bc it is banned by Constitution. Additionally, action prevents giving $$$bloodline to failed State oppressing Venezuelans

3350 2018-03-19 17:11:24 Glad I didn’t. I was tempted at $65 per barrel of Oil. Extremely sketchy, decided against it.
3351 2018-03-19 17:11:24 I gotta get a oil change & some dress pants but I do NOT feel like fucking moving 
3352 2018-03-19 17:10:58 Thank the Lord for tea tree oil
3353 2018-03-19 17:10:42 This documentary about saddam never mentioned anything about the American interests in Iraq's oil and about its threat to Israel.

Fuck your propaganda!

3358 2018-03-19 17:10:20 The massive gap from what? A project that doesn't exist yet? This is like a non-smoker fretting about what they'll do without two packs of cigarettes a day. Oil income a year from now will come from them same place it does today, while we work like hell to replace it asap.
3359 2018-03-19 17:10:15 Huh oil dont speak to me like that
3360 2018-03-19 17:10:09 ฮรือออ เป็นบ้า
3361 2018-03-19 17:10:08 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
3362 2018-03-19 17:09:44 Take a look at that nasty snake oil salesman reaching out his hand to the nasty erdogan there couldn't be a nastier couple of men right there I don't even like men or like women either but I like men less
3363 2018-03-19 17:09:39 What gap? We're talking about NOT doubling production. So Alberta ticks along at the same rate as before. 

Zero growth in oil sands doesn't mean zero GDP.

3366 2018-03-19 17:09:13 The limited vocabulary, so impressive. Repeating the same THING over and over dosen't make it true. Explain the Russian hotel deals, and oil deals. Traitor
3367 2018-03-19 17:09:07 “isn’t it weird we put oil on our food to fry it, AND put oil on our skin to fry it”
3368 2018-03-19 17:08:59 How about are turning into yam now now, I’ve got red oil in the kitchen???
3369 2018-03-19 17:08:35 Are you saying that more than 47 people will die if an oil tanker catches fire in Burnard Inlet? How will this tanker catch fire?
3370 2018-03-19 17:08:22 and you are you an oil paintiing!!!!
3371 2018-03-19 17:08:15 Oil acting stubborn , doesn't want to crack with markets.  Maybe a sign on strength to new highs coming in OIL , over 66.66?
3372 2018-03-19 17:08:15 Thankyou, my brain often takes curious turns. LOVE the banana!I'll have golden banana oil 
3373 2018-03-19 17:08:00 High Carb low fat is definitely poison, along with vegetable oil. Try finding even a yoghurt to buy that isn't low fat. Fruit sugars with their fruit acids really suck too.  Yet people think Smoothies are"Healthy"?  All the best.
3374 2018-03-19 17:07:59 coconut oil is actually the best thing in the world 
3375 2018-03-19 17:07:46 Mad as hell sad as hell that I ran out of Vitamin E oil.
3376 2018-03-19 17:07:25 My "foundational assumption" is that Russia & China know US will use the USD to destroy both economically, the way they did to Iran.  Russia's the world's biggest oil exporter, China it's biggest importer, & both have nukes.  Whatever they say gold is worth in oil terms, is a mkt
3377 2018-03-19 17:07:20 -deep conditionnnn. 
-I keep my hair natural as much as possible. I don't use heat probably more than once a month.
-also use Moroccan argan oil once its dry after a wash
-i use a paddle brush or a comb. never a bristle brush

3381 2018-03-19 17:06:59 of course the USA (Trump) would would ban a foreign #crypto that is backed by oil....that don't surprise me at all lol....
3382 2018-03-19 17:06:40 I don’t even understand why anybody would buy these in the first place.  To my knowledge, Venezuelans can’t buy it with their bolivars to pay down debt or taxes. It’s pegged to the price of oil but doesn’t give a security interest in any oil.

3392 2018-03-19 17:05:25 Hopefully it’s the death rattle of our dependence on oil, I’m so done with that shit
3393 2018-03-19 17:05:20 oil is a sealant. therefore, it’s perfectly ok to moisturize in your lotion of choice b4 you drench in oil.
3394 2018-03-19 17:05:13 i always feel better about myself when i get my cars oil changed lol

3398 2018-03-19 17:04:50 A few months ago I was naive. I thought all WV legislators represented the people & the good of the state. Now I know many represent lobbyists & our state is run by big pharma & oil! It’s time 2 change that #55ignited #Ojeda4Congress #rememberinMayandNovember

3410 2018-03-19 17:03:34 Lots of oil cars on the rails already.  So many that it's causing a backup of grain cars and financial hardships for farmers.  Pipelines are the only solution.
3411 2018-03-19 17:03:32 yes I did Jamaican black castor oil
3412 2018-03-19 17:03:27 Don't consume foods cooked in #oliveoil #safloweroil #canolaoil #avocadooil #grapeseedoil or any other liquid oil because they oxidize with heat.

3441 2018-03-19 17:00:03 Mind and oil, I really feel lonely because I can't talk with my friends..also yesterday was so awful..great.
3442 2018-03-19 17:00:01 Frying with olive oil not only satisfies your fried food cravings, but it also fulfills nutritional requirements for a healthy dietary fat too!
3443 2018-03-19 16:59:36 The smoke is definitely the worst (my throat starts this fun closing up thing 0_0) but the oil in food makes me itchy and nauseated. It's just a no good in general. For migraine/joint pain, I've gotten really good results from acupuncture, so I don't feel like I'm missing out lol
3444 2018-03-19 16:59:15 This lip oil I got from Ulta is amazing. I’m really in love with it

3456 2018-03-19 16:57:30 Ukraine has demanded sanctions against former German chancellor Schroeder who left office to take a job with Putin’s oil giant. He is now chairman of the second gas pipeline between Russia and Germany which will undercut Ukraine and E.Europe and increase Russia’s hold on Germany.
3457 2018-03-19 16:57:10 This is anti Russian western LIES against russia , NATO wants more money and bombs, guns etc then the the two main leaders in NATO the US UK can go to war to bring down Russia and get all there oil and gas ..!
3458 2018-03-19 16:57:01 Now that I think of it, I first heard "war for oil" in fall 2002. Iraq hadn't even started yet.

3464 2018-03-19 16:56:15 A loss of £8bn in oil taxation revenue, the loss of fiscal transfer from rUK, the costs of setting up a new state including currency reserves... But the separatists would be happy because although Scotland would be running a massive deficit at least they'd be "free!".

3468 2018-03-19 16:55:52 In 2017, our #1 export was oil - $70 billion.  #2 was autos - $29 billion.  It does not take a rocket scientist, or a climate zealot (Barb) to figure out where our bread is buttered.  Restrictions on oil is costing us billions per year in revenue.
3469 2018-03-19 16:55:49 I think I accidentally gave myself food poisoning because I forgot to clean the small cast iron be for reheating the cabbage I thought somebody recently used it so I reused the oil oh lord is my gut a rocket but doin dishes drinking water

3491 2018-03-19 16:53:31 Is that the essential oil of beer? Does it have the same effects on women? What if you applied to your feet, would your feet get larger? Wasn’t Newsweek sold for $1.00 not too long ago because they are a crap publication?
3492 2018-03-19 16:53:31 It's so embarrassing having to take your car to a dealership to get an oil change when my car is so disgustingly dirty
3493 2018-03-19 16:53:20 Additionally, "no gold is used in producing oil" has only been factually true since 1971.  For the 121 years that oil was commercialized prior to 1971, gold (-backed GBP & then gold-backed USD) WERE used in producing oil.  :)

3503 2018-03-19 16:52:40 In my analysis, once Saudi realised how Obama had screwed them, they switched reserves at that point to € denominated debt (bunds) and reinflated the oil price using ECB QE as liquidity. But it's possible, even probable, they insisted on gold collateral for Bunds

3510 2018-03-19 16:51:58 It is not pointless. The point is for the Saudis to take/control the vast, newly discovered Yemeni oil reserves, which may be larger than the Saudi reserves.

3575 2018-03-19 16:43:35 That ipo is funny considering it was an American co. Standard oil that got that ball rolling way back. How many $ trillions does it take to satisfy some?
3576 2018-03-19 16:43:32 Hi Harry. As a responsible retailer, we have met our commitment to exclusively use certified sustainable palm oil for all of our food products. We have completed an extensive programme of moving all of the palm oil in our own-label food products to RSPO certified oil 1/2

3579 2018-03-19 16:43:21 Footnote: Gov'ts said there would be open public debate on the pipeline... yet 4 years ago saw the oil company stock piling pipe in the interior of B.C. Before approval! No matter what side one is on, the public should NOT be handled with a SHAM!!
3580 2018-03-19 16:43:18 I think it is an essential oil with eucalyptus. But I am not sure

3586 2018-03-19 16:42:55 Putins greatest foe is green renewable energy, Putin exports oil and weapons.

We don't need what Putin is selling? Guess what, Putin fails, and his lucrative middle eastern wars?

They stop!
3587 2018-03-19 16:42:39 Can your dog get bored of eating their food? Atlas used to LOVE his food, and eating in general and lately he just hasn’t been into it and today he won’t even touch his food even when I put coconut oil on top. He’ll lick the oil off, but leaves his food.
3588 2018-03-19 16:42:32 If y’all know me you know my history with cars has been filled with horrible luck and my heart rate has not dropped to resting since I pulled up to the oil change place
3589 2018-03-19 16:42:27 Oprah!!
3590 2018-03-19 16:42:24 Just soak your hair in castor oil
3591 2018-03-19 16:42:22 Too many government actors have investment in big oil
3592 2018-03-19 16:42:17 If you have yet to discover the 10,000 magical uses of coconut oil, 

WAKEUPSIS. 
  .....
3593 2018-03-19 16:42:14 psa ladies: if you’re ever trying to use your lashes more than once/twice, use coconut oil to remove them & then add more coconut oil to them on the strip and the glue comes off really easy, then just clean em & let em dry
3594 2018-03-19 16:42:05 For that very reason I avoid Palm Oil like the plague, it is the only way. Thank you for your very informative tweets!

3596 2018-03-19 16:41:59 Oh yes I should do that. Right now I’m rubbing lavender oil on my temples.

3601 2018-03-19 16:40:43 have to go get an oil change 
3602 2018-03-19 16:40:38 Man the night when @meechrp_ poured oil on the nigga fake pradas I cried real tears man

3605 2018-03-19 16:40:20 49734617 pls report to the maintenance bay for your initial 45-day oil change.
3606 2018-03-19 16:39:47 what do you expect from a
someone who sells oil and makes alliances to what supposed to be their enemey?
3607 2018-03-19 16:39:32 So today I have purchased a 2 hour oil change (supposed to be 45 mins) and spent nearly $25 more on a pair of women's hiking boots than the identical men's pair cost. Feeling crabby. @CanadianTire @SportChek (same company!!!).
3608 2018-03-19 16:39:22 I can change my own oil...and tires.
Take out my own trash.

I’d rather pay the dealership to do some shit than a nigga expect me to clean up after his dirty ass just cuz he got a dick.
3609 2018-03-19 16:39:20 Kayaking protesters in Seattle were protesting oil pipelines.  In plastic kayaks that were carried to the water on top of SUVs.
3610 2018-03-19 16:39:18 How are they possibly keeping up with their school work?
3611 2018-03-19 16:39:16 Brave women of conviction scare you, hey @jkenney? I wouldn't expect anyone of loose and shady morals such as yourself to understand how brave Oil Activists are.
3612 2018-03-19 16:39:06  Just be careful to ONLY use extra virgin olive oil if you go this route because other oils can really clog your pores badly and cause more problems than it's worth! 
3613 2018-03-19 16:39:03 With which comparative trade advantages will they compete with each other? Crude oil or limestones?
3614 2018-03-19 16:38:58 SHELL OIL
3615 2018-03-19 16:38:43 @Toyota 3rd time getting my car serviced (oil change, etc) and 3rd time the car wash has been broken. I asked if I could at least get my windows cleaned (like @jiffylube ) and met w/ “if we have the supplies” 
3616 2018-03-19 16:38:36 They were standing out  I could smell the coconut oil and fresh wash n go's from a mile away. 
3617 2018-03-19 16:38:17 And finally...Young men who are regularly exposed to lavender or tree—or tea tree oil may be at the risk of developing large breasts.

Tp karena suka males beli online, jd face wash jepang aja yg ada di watsons(tamagohada hadalabo atau senka petfect whip misalnya) yg surfactant-nya coconut oil derived, sodium myristol, g deterjen SLES, at least
3621 2018-03-19 16:37:56 Then get the republican congressman to pass the legislation to protect him....Trump is pushing to see if your going to push back. ..statements arent enough! Call your political partners ...hope you are trying the weed oil combo that kills brain cancer...get well
3622 2018-03-19 16:37:54 Oatcakes for me, breadsticks for the boss. Or white bread with a touch of olive oil. My stepmother swore by rice porridge, but truth be told that was her cure for everything.
3623 2018-03-19 16:37:45 Not a good idea to fry with olive oil either, it becomes carcinogenic after being exposed to high temperatures.
3624 2018-03-19 16:37:38 "aye and use of hot oil to cook meat and another one tis of chocolate and fruit "
3625 2018-03-19 16:37:35 IDK ARE THEY @TIME @OIL
3626 2018-03-19 16:37:30 Japanese oil? What is it?

3628 2018-03-19 16:37:13 If they control our resources, as they do oil and gas, they control Scotland.
3629 2018-03-19 16:37:04 I imagine it could work as some oil would evaporate with the water. However, I just bake mine in the oven in a single layer at 375-400 til done
3630 2018-03-19 16:36:51 You gotta love how versatile coconut oil is
3631 2018-03-19 16:36:51 Even an 18 yr old knows Congress n Hinduism are like water n oil. Did Lakshmana , younger brother of Sri Ram made his presence felt n battle of Kurukshetra! Sir ask your pandits n reply.
3632 2018-03-19 16:36:36 What I would recommend for you to do is come on down to Spradley Ford Lincoln and see Dylan and he can set you up with a new car. Much easier than getting an oil change!
3633 2018-03-19 16:36:23 Getting an oil change & this lady is going crazy sobbing about life and how everything happens to her & blah blah blah.....i wanna slap her with positivity

3636 2018-03-19 16:35:57 However! A cheaper option is using extra virgin olive oil! I used to use it to remove my makeup but after a bit, it just felt /too/ oily for my taste. But there are people who use it very regularly
3637 2018-03-19 16:35:55 The engine is apparently shot. I had no problems with my car before I let a family friend change my oil. He drove it without putting the oil in for whatever reason and now I'm out $2200
3638 2018-03-19 16:35:54 Abscess drainage... I start eating nuff shit M, like constant takeaways & then my body rejects it so I get abscesses sometimes.. it's the fast food oil my body don't like!

3641 2018-03-19 16:35:30 if the 1% plans it just right, the world will stop fighting over the need for oil at about the same time the fresh water wars begin.
3642 2018-03-19 16:35:24 Omg! I feel really bad for both of them. My doctor told me that mesh in that area should be avoided if possible! So many complications.
3643 2018-03-19 16:35:00 came to get a lil $18 oil change, but instead my tab is at $450.. over today already
3644 2018-03-19 16:34:42 At 12:30pm  I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLK18) and USO on my software.
3645 2018-03-19 16:34:25 Their high salaries were justified 4-8 years ago in the then massive oil boom, but not today. #Alberta #teachers highest paid in country for no good reason anymore. 10 year wage freeze to bring salaries in line with reality is in order. Ditto with #nurses. @jkenney @RachelNotley

3659 2018-03-19 16:32:56 Oil and water don't mix but it will this summer 
3660 2018-03-19 16:32:35 Did they even go to any of the funerals?...or did they interfere with their tv appearances?
3661 2018-03-19 16:32:12 I’m with your doubts on this too Lisa. Could be a sham . I trust So. Korea much more than trump. 
My opinion, China, Russia, NK have a pact. Russia never stopped delivering oil/gas. China already has NK under their wing. God knows what trumps playing at.
3662 2018-03-19 16:32:04 We have pipelines that move oil all over the world and can desalinate water...so...
3663 2018-03-19 16:32:04 Please turn to cannabis oil! This will help you defeat your cancer, turn your pain down and helps you're body to recover from chemo

First and foremost because the @liberal_party have done nothing for #Newfoundland and #Labrador. Secondly, they're bad for oil and any party bad for oil is bad for the current NL economy.

Wake up, #NL.

3667 2018-03-19 16:31:46 More evidence that we need to keep Canadian oil products in Canada, for Canadians to use. Develop Canadian refining capacity, for North American market.

3673 2018-03-19 16:30:56 Is the new high oil prices a way to get this line pushed through? 
The big oil companies are holding Canada hostage wail they "give" away it away in USA. Sad
3674 2018-03-19 16:30:48 Further to Rex Article where is the outcry demanding the steel industry be shutdown. GHG emissions globally over 2B tons! Oil sands 250K. What about the 700K+ barrels of oil imported everyday? Why aren't these environuts protesting at the Port of Montreal, SArabia Nigeria Venez?

3681 2018-03-19 16:30:11 It’s hemp oil. Basically an edible version of hemp without the THC. It can be made with coconut oil or another form of a fat oil. It has mellowing effects.
3682 2018-03-19 16:30:09 The UAE and Saudi Arabia have SWFs for oil exports, which's why they're petro-states. Just cuz you don't want it to be true doesn't mean it isn't. An SWF is very common for petro-states.
3683 2018-03-19 16:30:07 Whats up with Canadian journalism?  And why do not anyone react on this lack of objectivity in the Quebec/Canadian journalism? Its a treat to democracy. Who will benefit the most if Canadian local oil and gas stays in the ground?. U.S.of America.
3684 2018-03-19 16:30:05 Bout to annoint you with oil
3685 2018-03-19 16:30:00 Nooooooooooo. That sounds not great. Even in oil form where it doesn’t get you high (that’s what I do for my anxiety)-but is good for pain relief and stuff?
3686 2018-03-19 16:29:58 Mode of such intake always matters.
For instance -: The Turmeric which is being taken for medicinal purposes is being heated through steamed/boiled water but once when being deep-fried into edible oil, it becomes useless and a cause for GIT related problems.

3698 2018-03-19 16:28:49 2/2 Bu inflation hedging funded inflated oil prices, in turn enabling Petrodollars (ie Eurodollar loans to consumers) to fund new shale reserves as 2nd Tier SPR & to bin the Saudis....then along came Trump & Obama's #TransitionthroughGas strategy became #EnergyDominance #OOTT
3699 2018-03-19 16:28:35 Dude, Norway is one of the largest net oil exporters in the world. By definition, it's already disqualified.

And I'm not sure how true that is. In 50% of the year in Scandinavia, the sun doesn't shine. How is solar practical?

3704 2018-03-19 16:27:34 I guess with oil spills we know the irrepairable damage it does to the environment.

we're seeing some of what happens when data is abused - weaponizing of data to manipulate voters and foreign powers influencing elections - and still, no consequences.
3705 2018-03-19 16:27:19 What power has SNP had, we are still in the EU? Did Scotland expect to get off ' free' on EU migrants. fishing & oil? EU had legislation ready if Remain vote to take over UK fuel resources for EU 'distribution'!

3716 2018-03-19 16:26:09 was hard core vegetarian with a very soy based diet for a decade - no breast growth
tried tea tree oil and lavendar for short  period no results pre hrt - reports i read referred to "young boys" which probably had more growth hormone(HGH) also in retrospect the time was too short

3721 2018-03-19 16:25:01 She would also blame the car manufacturer, the oil company providing gas for the vehicle, Jim Beam and, of course, the poor puppy!

3739 2018-03-19 16:22:44 No wonder we have plenty oil
3740 2018-03-19 16:22:38 One time when getting my oil changed the guy asked me for all my information. Then he asked me for my social I didn’t think anything about it and just started telling him. He cut me off saying he was joking but I still feel dumb for ALMOST giving my social out to a stranger

3761 2018-03-19 16:20:48 Yup, I remember using baby oil and laying out in the sun listening to the soundtrack of Pretty in Pink on tape. My friend and I used to argue over who's turn it was to flip the tape. Kid have no idea of the struggle with their fancy iPods and stuff...

3763 2018-03-19 16:20:34 Replication of a crystal structure is obtainable in laboratory, so what? That does not stop the need for oil drilling. Oil companies don't just poke random holes in the ground to find oil. They use fossil evidence and radiometric dating to prospect for oil reserves,
3764 2018-03-19 16:20:31 And you are a fucking hypocrite as you sit there and dismiss the benefits of oil writing your reply on a petroleum product. Give it all up then

Now it has crashed, what plans did they have to deal with such a horrendous loss of income?
The fact were in the UK means the gap left from zero oil revenues is made up by the UK.

3794 2018-03-19 16:17:56 Is transboundary water trading a plausible solution? Some regions will have increased rainfall in the wake of climate change.  Perhaps those regions can trade their excess like oil is currently being traded.

3802 2018-03-19 16:17:05 Back to using the woodstove for some good radiant heat, since the temperatures have really dropped reminding us winter is still here. We heat with wood in the really cold weather and use ground source geothermal in the milder weather. It is cheaper than oil .
3803 2018-03-19 16:17:05 I was talking with my parents about renewable energy today and we decided that next time we have money to spare we will get solar panels and heat pumps sober can make our own electricity and stop burning oil.

3838 2018-03-19 16:13:41 Did you change the oil after it sat since October? Might wanna do that. Prolly just the converter bolts cause it if threw a rod, it would be a lot different sounding than that I would think

3841 2018-03-19 16:13:32 I made this point elsewhere. The oil companies are desperate to double production because in a few years it won't be economical to process it at all. 

This is a desperate attempt to free stranded assets.

3847 2018-03-19 16:12:55 I tried cannabis oil for my Psoriasis, didn't work, now what?
3848 2018-03-19 16:12:52 China playbook is no help in this commodities cycle
 
Expected rise in electric vehicle demand will have the biggest effect on metals, not oil
3849 2018-03-19 16:12:51 iron, omega-3 (fish oil), mag, calcium, & vitamin K are ones women normally need more of, but ask your doctor! you should only take supplements for vitamins you actually need! like, vitamin k can be dangerous to take if you have blood clotting issues you aren’t aware of.
3850 2018-03-19 16:12:31 Oil changes mid week are the most inconvenient tasks
3851 2018-03-19 16:12:25 I take Hair Skin and Nail Vitamins with Biotin. (Gummies )
Drink Water
Exfoliate on Wednesday and Sunday.
Moisturize with CoCoa Butter 
And Seal with Coconut Oil. 
Beautiful Skin.
3852 2018-03-19 16:11:54 interesting that China etc are now not using dollars to buy Oil, the USA said hardly anybody else can do it. Now EU have agreed deal with USA to trade derivatives. the world keeps moving......
3853 2018-03-19 16:11:51 Nah I’m finna go get a oil change
3854 2018-03-19 16:11:50 Same. As soon as I’m out the shower. My after shower oil and butter
3855 2018-03-19 16:11:48 Ooh I agree especially if you’re referring to the Naija food. Cos the packaged Naija food we get in shops here like Egusi, ogbono, crayfish, palm oil are all trash!! The difference is so clear.
3856 2018-03-19 16:11:45 American students come to Florence but they really don’t know where they are.
It’s like I would try to cook fried chicken without oil. Unbelievable.

Russian oil producer says repayments are being made on schedule
3858 2018-03-19 16:11:41 Now that gas wholesalers have a narrative to blame anti pipeline activists & an BCNDP gov't to scapegoat, look out for jacked gas prices we would never see were we still using the old "maintenance at US refineries" excuse.
"Oil's Deep State"( recommended reading) is alive in B.C.

3861 2018-03-19 16:11:25 I have a simple goal. I just want some nice balsamic vinegar and some flavourful olive oil to dip some nice bread in.
3862 2018-03-19 16:11:24 And then there's Trump, who is reputed to be an enemy of the Deep State, but is the leading advocate for the Defense Industry, the Banking Industry, for the Oil Industry, for the Saudis ... while his cult-like followers believe he is fighting the very forces he's unleashing.
3863 2018-03-19 16:11:22 Didn't AlGore already do that?
3864 2018-03-19 16:11:13 honestly i usually get all my art supplies in store at blick when i go to the city but getting stuff online is so much cheaper holy shit pack of 25 oil pastels for 3.24 im going ham
3865 2018-03-19 16:11:13 Not an engine failure but great hyperbole @cnn. When one engine fails in a helicopter it's a forced landing in a field. When an engine is out of spec (they are very careful about the Sea King heli and metal fragments detected in the oil) then you divert to an airport.

3869 2018-03-19 16:10:43 Canada is arresting First Nations people for protesting against new pipeline for dirty tar sands oil @350Canada on land stolen from them. If an amoral authoritarian such as Putin does the same it is at least consistent with his overall philosophy.
3870 2018-03-19 16:10:40 It's not spring until dandelions are out, they are tasty greens! Just a light drizzle good quality olive oil w salt n pepper. Gotta try making the jam this year. It's comical when normies go mental over these wild flowers.

3872 2018-03-19 16:10:28 While the U.S. Supreme Court considers a Baker's religious right to not sell a wedding cake to a LGBT couple, oil and mining companies are preparing to destroy sacred Native American sites in Utah. On balance, which is more important? Gender based bias or heritage destruction.
3873 2018-03-19 16:10:24 It’s only right to put some oil on her butt before you hit it from the back. So I’ve been told

3882 2018-03-19 16:09:00 We're looking to speak to people involved in the oil and gas industry (as analysts, consultants, economists etc) regarding the recent 1.6% drop in the CNPC's crude production, as reported by Reuters #journorequest #prrequest
3883 2018-03-19 16:08:52 Walmart has two stations where they do oil changes and they only use one. Been here for almost two hours smh
3884 2018-03-19 16:08:49 ...and BC will not allow an increase in oil tankers out of Westridge through our waters at entirely at our risk. I don't think dorky Andrew Scheer has a hope in hell of being anyone's PM one day so...we'll see, once we roll closer to closer to 2019 with public sentiment. #cdnpoli
3885 2018-03-19 16:08:47 Tea tree oil too.

3887 2018-03-19 16:08:38 He’s got all the tools no doubt. Big, great skater, good shot. Even developing his forecheck. But cmon matt, uve gotta admit he looks fairly ineffective out there for the last while. And that ur at least somewhat concerned he doesn’t turn into that beast 30 goal guy we hoped.
3888 2018-03-19 16:08:31 Sis... craziest thing... I’m trying to ‘help’ my sister get to this point - and it feels like trying to get oil out of water... like the problems are SO obvious And on the surface. But it feels impossible at the same time- weird analogy but the closest thing I can think of
3889 2018-03-19 16:08:31 Is there more than what happened yesterday?
3890 2018-03-19 16:08:28 จริงดิ โอ้ยยยดีจาย
3891 2018-03-19 16:08:16 If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly, you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage.
3892 2018-03-19 16:08:16 Haha.... I can practically smell the Mojitos and coconut oil.
3893 2018-03-19 16:08:05 @naeyeson completing your bio.... I don't like sardine oil... I always discard it... But oops here it is on twitter and I now follow it...
3894 2018-03-19 16:07:38 So once again you insist on considering only part of the argument in the hopes that it will help your case. We live in the real world where you don't simply get to ignore that shutting down the pipeline expansion means more oil-by-rail
3895 2018-03-19 16:07:28 Ps I'm a local.I want oil from HH.
3896 2018-03-19 16:07:25 مشكلة العلمي مشكلة

3898 2018-03-19 16:07:11 So if you buy a Tesla or other EV speculating that oil price inflation will drive prices higher on fuel vs on electricity prices... Would the SEC consider your Tesla a security?
3899 2018-03-19 16:07:07 Ive never tried castor oil. How does it feel?
3900 2018-03-19 16:07:05 kapit na lang ako sa efficascent oil ngayon para kahit papano mawala yung sakit ng kamay at binti ko.

3902 2018-03-19 16:06:54 I received a tip that the Dutch Bakery may be frying their donuts in oil containing some trans fats. It is incumbent upon people of good character to not allow these trespasses of secular culture creep into our community.
3903 2018-03-19 16:06:47 Throughout the 90s , Metro Vancouver closed all but one oil refinery,assured  that Alta. refineries could supply gas for BC via Kinder Morgan pipeline. Does anyone know why they thought that, now that the NW US gas companies,who "top up BC's gas supply"are raping BC.?#bcpoli
3904 2018-03-19 16:06:42 Have you been to the Vancouver Olive Oil Company? They have stuff brought in seasonally that you buy bulk. Best option for you.

3907 2018-03-19 16:06:32 I remember Cheny on MTP telling Russert it would cost $1-2 billion after $$ from oil contracts American orgs would be getting.
3908 2018-03-19 16:06:15 Here's the thing; the reason the multinational oil co. R so desperate to ship the dilbit is that in just a few years it's not going to be economical to even dig it out of the ground. 

This isn't a "national interest" story, it's the last desperate attempt to free stranded assets
3909 2018-03-19 16:06:14 Hi Philip, not for Oil burners unless it is connected in a dual heating system that includes solid fuel central heating.  Thank you.

3912 2018-03-19 16:05:33 I sympathize, friend - on my day off last month, I took the car in for an oil change. Ended up with $400 total repairs

3916 2018-03-19 16:05:11 Who has heard of CBD oil?
3917 2018-03-19 16:05:10 No....argues that an oil fire in the Burrard Inlet caused by an oil tanker is going to cause a much worse disaster than even the Lac-Mégantic train disaster! You're back to being a lobbyist again for Big Oil @BlairKing_ca ! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

3920 2018-03-19 16:05:05 Gude: #ACSNOLA Spike or decline in voltage from these sensors can indicate a problem with an oil pipeline--before a major leak develops. It will have a transmitter to send the info to people.
3921 2018-03-19 16:05:01 @SecretaryPerry What else do you expect from an oil man from an oil state, surrounded by oil supported Russian lackeys? Blinded by smog.
3922 2018-03-19 16:04:58 I just FaceTimed my dad, and he complimented my skin, and how clear it looked! I’ve been using Hemp Oil for a few weeks. And it’s so nice that someone who doesn’t see me very often, noticed!  #clearskin #hempoil
3923 2018-03-19 16:04:58 Yeah my skin is the same too. For me is I’ll just get 1 big pimple when my period comes but I spot treat with tea tree oil & I wake up brand new
3924 2018-03-19 16:04:37 Car Insurance should cover regular maintenance like oil changes and headlights
3925 2018-03-19 16:04:34 Aint nun a lil holy oil won’t help
3926 2018-03-19 16:04:22 Ah, I see. In the UK the 'old' fats have gone out of fashion. Cooking will mostly be with vegetable (rapeseed/sunflower) oil and Olive oil. Adventurous cooks like me will also have sesame, peanut, full fat butter, ghee and the like. Never read the labels 
3927 2018-03-19 16:04:11 By indulgences, do you mean carbon credits? Because Climate Change Pope Gore has already led the way in those
3928 2018-03-19 16:03:44 Gude: #ACSNOLA These microbial sensors can survive harsh conditions where these pipelines are and can eat oil. They are placed outside of pipelines.

3931 2018-03-19 16:03:29 Dear monday, at least use some oil. 
3932 2018-03-19 16:03:29 I thought it was dropping off oil (or picking it up) as only really seen big tankers out there.

3950 2018-03-19 16:01:17 Trains don't go over water Blair, this is about oil tankers of oil burning even more out of control than a train of oil burning. What's the biological impact of that in the Burrard Inlet? #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #sanchi
3951 2018-03-19 16:01:17 There’s that tantalizing item in the dossier about the mysterious unclaimed 19.5% share in Rosneft. Can oil deals run the world?? Certainly explains Tillerson.
3952 2018-03-19 16:01:10 I love rose water and @doterra rose essential oil  
3953 2018-03-19 16:01:10 I was looking for a new night hydrating cream, and after reviews and a lot of research and went and got myself some good ol' coconut oil.
3954 2018-03-19 16:01:07 Want.

Even though Kitsilano has a strong Greek community, it's still tough to get the good olive oil. :(
3955 2018-03-19 16:00:59 With oil profits becoming more unreliable the Saudis are gonna have to build a more diversified economy. You can't do that with half a potential workforce at home.
3956 2018-03-19 16:00:56 Good work by the RNC. I was in grade 12 in 1986 and we were told that the offshore oil industry would create a boom and bust scenario. It would also create a drug problem and increase in crime. We scoffed at it back then, but now it's here.
3957 2018-03-19 16:00:50 Went to get my oil changed, they told me 3 hours, said never mind and went to target and shopped. I’m a bad “adult”
3958 2018-03-19 16:00:48 I could go on, but I'm not a troll so I won't
Unless you want me to
These are tame compared to what these SAME COMPANIES do in other countries
Believe me, ethics are nowhere to be found in the Big Oil industry except in their propaganda

3959 2018-03-19 16:00:46 Benzene is a natural part of crude oil and gasoline.  It is also a byproduct of cigarette smoke. It can be used to make plastics, resins, nylon, synthetic fibers, lubricants, rubbers, dyes, detergents, drugs and pesticides.
3960 2018-03-19 16:00:45 I think overall we benefit from a lower dollar. Fishery, Tourism, Oil, Minerals.  All huge sectors. Are there canadian based alternativesfor you?
3961 2018-03-19 16:00:43 Exogenous exposures could be topical androgens, chicken, milk, lavender oil, tea tree oils, and #EDCs in children w precocious #puberty

3962 2018-03-19 16:00:36 And the fact that you believe she actually said that probably makes you mindless.  Plus, you bought the Snake Oil peddled by #45, and swallowed his fish stories hook, line and sinker.  That speaks volumes.  You need to stop watching FOX faux news.  And stay away from Russian bots
3963 2018-03-19 16:00:29 Worth noting that renewable energy systems like wind and solar are not water hogs. This is in stark contrast to coal, oil, gas.
3964 2018-03-19 16:00:27 Ponds deposits oil in your face don’t do that, use a water based moisturizer so it hydrated but doesn’t make you oily. A good drugstore one is neutrogena hydra boost. Cetaphil is good but your skin will get immune to it after a while so try switching things up in between

3976 2018-03-19 15:59:03 This lady thinks because she brings oil, comb, and brush I’m going to lower the price.... ummm no
3977 2018-03-19 15:59:00 i think oil is just back testing

3984 2018-03-19 15:58:17 On the contrary, the reason I was trying to find the beef grease was reading peer-reviewed papers on the evils of partially-hydronated oils. The best fats according to the papers are coconut oil and beef tallow. Canola oil is not good because it's a close cousin to rape seed. Bad
3985 2018-03-19 15:58:16 .@CMSennott says Tillerson and Trump got along like oil and water — or rather, like "oil and Diet Coke"
3986 2018-03-19 15:58:14 It’s only a matter of time. But of course the same politicians who push an expanded oil sands can’t publicly speak of such things.
3987 2018-03-19 15:58:13 Right now, the Republicans are "bending over" while Trump screws the country. Good thing they are also friends of big oil and lubricants.
3988 2018-03-19 15:58:10 And I hate canola oil 
3989 2018-03-19 15:58:09 If there was a small oil well in Afrin, I would cover all the international community there and fight only for oil theft. Unfortunately, there is only olive in Afrin.

3994 2018-03-19 15:57:39 Just seen rates were cut. Not sure they will mean anything. 

I stopped having faith in these fiscal /monetary tools after Eurobond. I also thought cheap oil would do us good, but anyways!!
3995 2018-03-19 15:57:37 I really wish somebody could buy me tea tree oil and jojoba oil.. Just for being a good person
3996 2018-03-19 15:57:36 Cut regulations too that will make more money for big oil!  Are we winning yet?
3997 2018-03-19 15:57:30 Yes, I get that. The fact is the risk isn't zero and the consequences are huge. And we're making that risk a lot larger.

Personally I agree it's generally safe. My reason to keep the oil in the ground is that I like skiing, and would like the shoreline to stay where it is.

4000 2018-03-19 15:56:57 Well done! Etymologically, the word 'diet' means 'way of life' - as a nutritional and cognitive behavioural therapist, I find huge improvements in mood & energy when we remove the primary allergens - as well as sugar and wheat, sunflower oil is linked with depression and fatigue.

4003 2018-03-19 15:56:30 Of course the USA is better off without Canada getting its oil to shoreline! 
They are the ones with Russia helping to fund anti pipeline activists!

4009 2018-03-19 15:55:31 Reminded once again that, "we don't have time to implement a process" is akin to, "I don't have time to change my car's oil". It doesn't matter until it's too late.
4010 2018-03-19 15:55:24 @News18India The villagers were not "looting" oil infact they were utilizing the spilling oil.

4043 2018-03-19 15:52:38 It's based on the steady erosion of services paired with the ill-fated creation of a town-centric petro-state economy with everything based on the notoriously volatile price of oil. The subversion of every facet of the economy except oil, then the idiotic obsession with MF.

4068 2018-03-19 15:48:07 Isn't this just another way to divert attention toward tech and away from our fossil fuel consumption? To me this just seems like a way for big money (fossil fuel) to make it seem like everything is ok. Instead of selling more oil and aerosols let's just control our consumption.

4079 2018-03-19 15:47:06 2/ ...the ability to use CNY oil & gold to create Chinese current acct autonomy means the IMF "FX reserve adequacy math" many China/CNY bears are using becomes irrelevant.  This means the US cannot use the USD to sink China like it did to USSR & multiple other EM's past 40 yrs.

4106 2018-03-19 15:45:03 Back in 2003 petroleum experts thought we'd be facing $300/bbl oil today. Still predicted $300 as recently as 2011. Iraq/Afghanistan set us up to enter Iran. Ruthless? Yes. But $300 oil in Gulf state hands? No thanks. 

Only a mistake w hindsight of shale oil.

4124 2018-03-19 15:43:17 But why? Lol! Oh "Oil Tot" you deserve so much better then a #LoganPaul moment! #TheMoreYOuKnow
4125 2018-03-19 15:43:01 @SEAT_cars_UK SERE (approved SEAT servicing) tell me SEAT say it's ok for my Leon to have an oil leak, "it's within SEAT guidelines". Is it true you have guidelines that allow oil leaks?
4126 2018-03-19 15:42:58 I'm in the Offshore oil gas and renewables industry. I have a very knowledgeable understanding of our energy mix and demand in the U.K.
4127 2018-03-19 15:42:50 Naw son you never had a platonic friendship you commissioned a car sized oil painting of ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
4128 2018-03-19 15:42:40 Yup! So true babe ... that oil is amazing!
4129 2018-03-19 15:42:30 And thats why all have not provinces have one thing in common none of them have developed oil and gas fields.
4130 2018-03-19 15:42:24 More likely to be hydrogenated corn oil or chlorinated chicken fat now.
4131 2018-03-19 15:42:14 Be careful, the olive may tire of your games and pass you by. For what it's worth I can't get on board with olive oil. It's a necessary evil now that chip fat is out of fashion.
4132 2018-03-19 15:42:13 Then, why are we talking about how it's shipped TO the coast and talk about 7 times more oil tankers out of Westridge, through densely populated Metro Vancouver, through the Straight of Juan de Fuca and up our rugged NW Coast and the risks associated to that! #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4133 2018-03-19 15:42:01 Maybe include a few drops of lavender (or other essential oil) on a tissue near pillow 
4134 2018-03-19 15:42:00 Yeeees!! That oil is magic! 
4135 2018-03-19 15:41:52 If any of my twitter friends are interested in CBD oil Please DM me as I have just become a distributor for the very best available in the UK
4136 2018-03-19 15:41:35 Apply Rapeseed oil and I hope YOUR friend takes my invaluable advise 
4137 2018-03-19 15:41:33 คือของคนอื่นเขาก็ไม่พริ้วขนาดนี้ไง 555
4138 2018-03-19 15:41:31 Yeah some products are definitely predatory like that. Some ingredients like coconut oil people just be putting on they face cuz it sounds good but that’s one of the more pore clogging oils out there
4139 2018-03-19 15:41:26 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once Orange Hairpiece cries about #CNN being unfair, a famous mouse cries for mama #resist
4140 2018-03-19 15:41:18 สุดท้ายก็เหมือนเดิม คนเดียวเพิ่มเติมคือเกิดอะไรขึ้น?
4141 2018-03-19 15:41:10 Not here it wasn't sweets, we can put him on mute. Has he said a thing? What really bothers me is the people who don't live here, you know the bots putting thier 2cents in sow thier own special brand of oil whats worse, Americans playing into their stuff. We are scared!
4142 2018-03-19 15:41:02 Broccoli. Carrot. Fried in coconut oil with a touch of salt, black pepper and fresh ginger. Cooked with a beef cube and then pureed and finished off with cream, or not.

My #recipebook is long overdue.
4143 2018-03-19 15:41:00 Trade pricing requires only a rate. Producers/traders may settle Shanghai futures contract in oil. Indeed the contract has been specifically designed to achieve this & is closer to LME forward contracts than to the financialised regulatory disaster zone of the Brent contract
4144 2018-03-19 15:40:51 Left a tampon on the seat of my car so the oil change guy had to move it lol
4145 2018-03-19 15:40:50 US relationship with S Arabia is not based only on oil. S.Arabia has  funded Iraq war against Iran for 10 years, it is supporting Egypt's Illegally elected President Sisi with billions of $ aid. In fact S Arabia has been serving US interests in Middle East for last 50 years.
4146 2018-03-19 15:40:47 I SPRAYED SO MUCH PEPPERMINT OIL WHY IS THERE STILL WASPS GETTING IN HERE
4147 2018-03-19 15:40:37 Oh please we all know the liberals are anti oil and anti pipeline. Tell us why upstream and downstream regulations are only put on Canadian oil and imported Mid East oil gets a pass?
4148 2018-03-19 15:40:31 たらこって美味いよな！
4149 2018-03-19 15:40:25 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
4150 2018-03-19 15:40:23 Might be worth looping @MollyMcKew into the convo. From what I can glean she is pretty dismissive of snake oil sales people while ALSO providing sober cyber threat analysis. Some portion of this assessment may be in her wheelhouse.
4151 2018-03-19 15:40:14 Why would NOTLEY be embarrassed? This has been her plan, put anti oil in positions of influence & claim impartial as they attack oil and gas
4152 2018-03-19 15:40:11 I think he uses condom because the oil will actually feel soft coz the hand is hard
4153 2018-03-19 15:39:49 Arrest them all and make them cleanup their garbage . Wanna support US oil / economy just move there , cause if we don’t make it they will .
4154 2018-03-19 15:39:39 @punditclass  
If they were not receiving gov't paychecks 2feed their family and relied on oil 4 a livelihood They wouldn't B there
4155 2018-03-19 15:39:38 Why pay for laser eye surgery when you can just put CBD Oil directly into your eyeballs
4156 2018-03-19 15:39:12 It is about relative spill risk which is what you keep forgetting. Given the increased likelihood of a spill by oil-by-rail or an unassisted tanker then the numbers change. That is the part you choose to ignore
4157 2018-03-19 15:39:06 We are dealing with eco-terrorists in BC. The societal chaos that turning off the gas taps would elicit an immediate retreat from the B.C. govt. The oil sands are a national treasure abused by its nation. It’s time for hardball. #shutoffthetaps
4158 2018-03-19 15:38:52 LeBron's teammates said he gained 7 pounds in a game? That's easy for him. Quick oil change at halftime.
4159 2018-03-19 15:38:50 @realDonaldTrump My friend working in Iraq,doing generators happened to see an old oil tanker parked by his job ,being boared he decided to explore truck.he opened top latch to tanker and inside was neatly piled up GOLD BARS each bar weighing 75 lb. he steped in and took a

4161 2018-03-19 15:38:32 きたくした。おなかすいた
4162 2018-03-19 15:38:30 Need to drop my car off for a oil change , tune up , alignment , a wash, just a makeover baby 
4163 2018-03-19 15:38:18 very quietly... and I meant quiet, there was an oil spill into the McKenzie River in Eugene. For those who don't know, almost everyone in Lane County gets its drinking water from the McKenzie...
4164 2018-03-19 15:38:17 I would invest in cannabis oil because they are lots of sick folks out there and cannabis oil can help them.
4165 2018-03-19 15:38:09 やめてっ！
ありんこさんのライフはゼロよ！！
4166 2018-03-19 15:38:08 Plenty of Arabs are living very high on the horse. They own their own oil. Not sure why you keep using the oil argument. We export oil now, we don’t own any oil fields in the Middle East.
4167 2018-03-19 15:38:05 I wouldn't recommend HTX. I live here and don't like it. Traffic is awful and city lacks a spirit of creativity and innovation. Still an oil/gas town. Try Austin or Dallas (my hometown). 
4168 2018-03-19 15:37:48 Or the oil runs out in about 90 years? And we haven't even started the development of the collar site around the stadium which will have a stratospheric impact on our revenue.
4169 2018-03-19 15:37:41 Not shit!! Wyd?? Change my oil for me
4170 2018-03-19 15:37:38 You could have saved space by just saying “ok. I’m stupid now”. Automatic weapons?? Maybe oil lamps? Gas not around til early 1800s.  Would that be the “select few” 70 million gun owners? Lemme guess...YOU have no use for guns. Thanks for sharing. Great intelligent discussion
4171 2018-03-19 15:37:33 My grandpa built his own furnace out of a 60-gallon oil drum. Unfortunately was also an amateur veterinarian to his cats, as well as his own in-home urologist (too painful to explain). Toughest son of a bitch the world has ever seen. Lived on his own for 99 out of his 100 years.
4172 2018-03-19 15:37:29 Anyone ever use one of the new oil less fryers?  Does it work?  Is the food good?  Would you recommend buying one?
4173 2018-03-19 15:37:25 ไม่เข้าใจเลย
4174 2018-03-19 15:37:23 Let’s see in 73-74 the Country was in a deep recession, stock market crash, 9% unemployment, oil crisis/embargo and high inflation...How are the numbers now?
4175 2018-03-19 15:37:22 I have to drive thru this stuff when I go to the dump. When the weather is wet or snowy I exit the dump with a car literally coated in what looks like black crude oil. Clumps under the chassis and coats everything. Nightmare! Now again, in our waterways.
4176 2018-03-19 15:37:22 I was young when all of this happened but wasnt the entire reason for this war because of Oil?
4177 2018-03-19 15:37:19 baby oil is great for this but i think i was in elementary school the last time i was in a house that had baby oil

4179 2018-03-19 15:36:59 You are a broken record.  Blabbing on about benefits of oil 
The truth is foreign Oil Companies take their profits home or to off shore investments.  They leave behind a paltry % to Canada.
They have raped this land long enough #cdnpoli #StopKM
4180 2018-03-19 15:36:52 Oil bet he is planning a world tour of natural resources to be exploited.
4181 2018-03-19 15:36:52 I will agree that a conversation on how we get our energy is important. However it’s also important to understand that we need to diversify our energy. That doesn’t mean the death of oil or jobs. It’s also important to look at the whole picture even if you’re not for green energy

4189 2018-03-19 15:35:41 From low base the private players must have doubled their share. They just milk where sale potential is high, while PSU Oil Co's fan out to all and sundry places.Pvt players are just fairweather business & will not lift a little finger to meet the larger needs of the country.
4190 2018-03-19 15:35:31 All in this month I’ve needed new brakes, rotors, a new trunk (bc my stepdad hit my car), replaced an LED taillight, an oil change, replaced a tire, found out today I have a nail in my other tire....long story short I’m selling an Audi A4 for $125 or best offer hmu
4191 2018-03-19 15:35:30 A hydrating facial mask, earthy blue, with woad, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating softwood microbeads. It comes as a powder in a simple plastic flask.
4192 2018-03-19 15:35:29 As for lipstick etc. You have to remember that refined crude oil is a fairly recent invention. Before that humans relied on rendered animal fats for much in daily life. Natural gas and petroleum products are to thank for ending the whaling industry
4193 2018-03-19 15:35:15 It takes a long time to assimilate folks to freedom. That's why our current mad rush of immigration is so bonkers.

4195 2018-03-19 15:35:05 CDWP approved Petroleum Technology Institute KARAK for Rs 2.2 Billion presented by ACS KP and CEO KPOGCL in Planning Commission Islamabad today.
1200 students and 165 new jobs for the province.
4196 2018-03-19 15:35:03 Kids are also voting left because they are the only parties who put forward serious environmental policies, and a goal for a low-carbon future. Conservative parties would have us bury our heads in the sand, and pump oil 'til the cows come home!
4197 2018-03-19 15:34:57 The look of a man who knows that when we finally exhaust our dwindling oil supplies, he and his will rule us.
4198 2018-03-19 15:34:48 That's as absurd as me saying to you, if you don't care about the environment stop breathing the air and drinking the water. The safest way is to say NO to an increase in oil tankers by not allowing the #KM expansion to Westridge if it's about creating oil spill risk. #bcpoli
4199 2018-03-19 15:34:44 ใช่ค่าาากรอบฟิล์ม
4200 2018-03-19 15:34:33 irl told me to buy tea tree oil for my skin but it’s so expensive.. is it worth it? is it worth 10 thousand dollars?
4201 2018-03-19 15:34:18 the fact that I have to choose between getting my oil changed or going to the doctors for my swollen lips is the most depressing adult thing I've come across thus yet.
4202 2018-03-19 15:34:18 Oil and gas pun okay rasanya 
4203 2018-03-19 15:34:12 If we can send oil across the country in pipelines, why not water? The spills would be much easier to deal with.
4204 2018-03-19 15:34:04 How many people are asking for 50/50 gender representation on oil rigs or waste management, or active duty military? Seems awfully selective which industries are targeted for "equal representation".
4205 2018-03-19 15:34:04 WRONG OIL, ROBOT
4206 2018-03-19 15:34:03 How about the good people of Alberta that work in the oil sands? No love for them?

4216 2018-03-19 15:33:03 Yea bro like venezuela ever treat Guyana as sister nation ? After oil was discovered, maduro sign decree claiming the area where it was discovered. Then terminated numerous trade agreements including rice deal. Thats not sisterly love.
4217 2018-03-19 15:32:57 持ってないねんけどな
4218 2018-03-19 15:32:44 So Cambridge Analytica caught in lie about working with Russian contacts (Russian Oil Olegarch) is now connected with Facebook heist, Parscale, Bannon, Kushner, Wikileaks, and NRA too. Let's let fake Pres Trump keep running the country into the ground though. No rush @GOP
4219 2018-03-19 15:32:32 yeah that’s what i’m trying to stretch to! i took them out this morning and they were both pouring blood down my neck lol. i put bactine and coconut oil a bit ago after i showered.
4220 2018-03-19 15:32:26 5. You have companies (local and international) waiting to drill but no one can be bothered to sign documents.
6.Nigeria is too slow for the oil business
7. You will be using all your own oil for refining - Unless you drill more
4221 2018-03-19 15:32:10 Of course UK should have set up something similar, as ever Tories used it to suit only themselves. As for calling it Scotland’s oil, a few miles off the Lincs coast there are vast turbines harvesting what, if you use the same logic, is England’s wind. Do we keep that or share?
4222 2018-03-19 15:32:07 Totally guilty of doing an oil deal with Russia.
Massive obstruction of Justice!
4223 2018-03-19 15:31:52 Changing the oil in the car. Competitive weed eating. Testing the smoke detectors.
4224 2018-03-19 15:31:39 That’s why they are selling Oil!
4225 2018-03-19 15:31:36 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4226 2018-03-19 15:31:32 The fact is, a collision is certain. From 1995-2008, 14 oil spills from tankers in Washington State released 13,709 gallons, and there were 132 near-miss reportable incidents. (just with oil tankers) 

That's just the US who tracks this suff better.
4227 2018-03-19 15:31:30 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
4228 2018-03-19 15:31:26 No..it's an oil spill you've been trying to see all this time and that's the sell point you haven't convinced anyone of yet so? You've indicated you're a Registered Professional Biologist...Let's talk Marine Biology! And Spills @BlairKing_ca ! That's what this is all about right?

4234 2018-03-19 15:30:58 US/Saudi #BigLong supports $ oil price at Seller Market clearing level c $25/bbl above Buyer Market level. IMHO Shanghai contract aim is to cut back ICE Brent priced bids backed by 1bn bbl of SPR & to reset oil price at lower level. Doing so saves China >$200m per day oil costs

4237 2018-03-19 15:30:23 First I heard of him was an indyref debate in 2014 in which he referred to No voters as traitors then explained why the Afghanistan invasion happened: all to do with an oil pipeline, & never once mentioned fact 3,000 innocent people had been murdered in NY. A joke.

4242 2018-03-19 15:29:57 First of all, I am flattered 
Secondly, not all of it is natural, some of it is an extension 
But, I spray a concoction of Vitafro hair oil, coconut oil, water, and pink oil all mixed up real good. (Note 50% of the volume is water)

4250 2018-03-19 15:29:15 Certainly an argument to be made that the best teams are determined by their bankroll, but it’s definitely the fairest. That said - there’s nothing stopping an Arab oil prince from buying and dumping a ton of money into a team like Norwich City.
4251 2018-03-19 15:29:09 While all of you are worried about what celebrities are doing, I’m worried about oil and natural gas drilling and dumping. People are messed up.

4267 2018-03-19 15:27:43 tbh now i just really mad like this whole video thing was never an issue to start with but people are calling it a "controversy" and trying to make it sound bad. Some ppl just like to stir up drama and bc this issue doesnt affect them, they'll just keep adding oil to the fire

4270 2018-03-19 15:27:28 People moan about oil/power companies but still drive a car and warm their homes. These are the biggest ad servers. No other choice. The salient point is there was an election, parties promote themselves... No news here, but if you really care where’s the Tory comparison?
4271 2018-03-19 15:27:27 Agreed. I think Iran is going on Trumps naughty list just like Venezuela. Basically the majority of that oil will be off the market except within the Russian-Chinese-Indian sphere. Canada will be the US biggest source of heavy. US also to replace Russian oil and gas in Europe.

4312 2018-03-19 15:22:09 That's not the correct context.  If China can print CNY for oil, it's FX reserves (26% of GDP or ~$3.1T) can move towards the same level of the only other nation that can print ccy for oil (the US), whose FX reserves = 0.6% of GDP.  If so, who'll fund rising US govt deficits?

4318 2018-03-19 15:21:33 Soz, it’s how locals speak in the broch, which is the area around Peterhead & Fraserburgh since Aberdeen Council fucked the fish trade to concentrate on the big buck oil trade.

4404 2018-03-19 15:12:35 If Brent is $4 to $7 over WTI & you price against Brent globally with minor differentials why would you send oil to the US unless you have an additional contract mandating supply? Unit of account is irrelevant with a liquid FX market #OOTT
4405 2018-03-19 15:12:26 K so craig has a drilling rig I guess. I don't know much about drilling rigs, as it turns out. Prior to this thread I assumed rig worker tools were large, strong, heavy specialized gear coated in oil. Hard to imagine scenario when 1m cross-cut hand saw is exactly what you need.

The story they were responding to was about Bombardier, not oil -- and it was published in the Globe. Maybe get your basic facts in line.

4429 2018-03-19 15:10:02 This is true, all of the red tape this govt has rolled out is killing the oil industry slowly but surely. Companies over hired and over spent in 12/13, the massive loss of jobs in such a short period of time will take its toll for years to come. Confidence is lost.
4430 2018-03-19 15:09:56 If Venezuela have "free cash flow" Why Venezuelans are going from the country ??? why are they dying of hunger? why are they dying to not get medicines? Russia has other interests on venezuela not interested in money or oil are panders of the Venezuelan narcoregimen

4437 2018-03-19 15:09:10 ...furthermore, b/c Putin's moves will drive gold higher in terms of oil, this then means that "whoever" has been pseudo-pegging USD/gold at $1150-1300 for the past 5 yrs is, post-Putin actions w/gold, capping the USD of oil, which is not helpful to US shale growth needed...
4438 2018-03-19 15:09:08 By early 2010, stocks had bounced 80%, oil was trading $100-150bbl, China had launched a massive fiscal stimulus and the Fed had loaded the bazooka. Expecting rates to crawl back to 2-2.5% didn’t seem so crazy.
4439 2018-03-19 15:08:50 So, where are you talking about oil spills on spawning streams, on salmon, on Southern Resident Orcas...on the impact of an oil spill to ALL the creatures I see, living from the sea as I walk along the coast. Never heard you talk about that...for Big Oil, of course! #bcpoli
4440 2018-03-19 15:08:49 I know whatcha sayin fam. Gotta keep them engine warm.  Gotta make sure all that oil be flowing smoothly
4441 2018-03-19 15:08:49 80 first nations groups are behind the pipeline expansion. Every first nations group is behind a warm home and fuel for there truck. All first nations groups want government services that are paid for by a strong economy. Would you like to pay to import oil and not export any?

4443 2018-03-19 15:08:48 No problem, I got into a bad accident a couple years back and lime with coconut oil really helped reduce some of mine. Mine were on my body though if you have scars on your face do a little more research before you put stuff on your face it could be more damaging.
4444 2018-03-19 15:08:31 I've tried 10+ anti oil shampoos, and finally found one that works. But it makes my head unbearably itchy. I can't cut my hair short, cause seeing my forehead causes too much emotional grief. Pls send help

4450 2018-03-19 15:07:46 No, he'll see the gold price rise in oil terms; indeed, in Sep-14 when SGEI launched, gold was 13 bbls/oz; 4 mths later, 30 bbls.  12 months after that, 45 bbls.  It has since pulled back to 22x, but that's still > LT ceiling of ~20x that had persisted prior to SGEI launch...

4457 2018-03-19 15:07:14 Really, A few questions for you:
1- says who iraq was looting kuwait oil? As all documents state, it was a point of dispute, and there were suspicions that kuwait with US were drilling wells with slopes that would actually drag down Iraq oil toward kuwat wells
4458 2018-03-19 15:07:08 It’s all about renewables. Solar, wind, wave, etc. Stop support for dirty fuels. No more oil, gas, coal. We must address climate change!
4459 2018-03-19 15:07:00 The irony of this is... their kayaks are made of..plastic which is made with......petroleum products  which is....OIL as is most of the clothing, vehicles, etc they use every single day to protest what... pipelines, oil tankers and so on and so on
4460 2018-03-19 15:06:49 Let’s see, I get my teeth cleaned twice a year, maybe two doctor appointments, four or five oil changes...

4466 2018-03-19 15:05:53 Imaginative. But to the extent Putin withholds oil from the market & demands gold from buyers he'll see the oil price rise in $ terms. So other producers make out like bandits at Russia's expense while China laughs all the way to the bank by paying for deliveries in gold

4485 2018-03-19 15:04:00 Russia's economy is sandwiched some where between California's & Texas' economies. It depends mainly on oil as its primary export. In essence, Russia (Putin) hasn't diversified & invests little in it's people. It depends heavily on world oil prices which are declining & volatile.

4509 2018-03-19 15:00:51 Coconut oil seems to easily coagulate in the same way that butter or palm oil do, I don’t tend to trust in highly coagulative oils while am not in a warm country.

4513 2018-03-19 15:00:36 Credibility is in what is being posted. It's all facts...t's all legitimate concerns for the environmental impact of an oil tanker spill in our BC waters. If it's about anyone's greed, it's Alberta's and Big Oil for asking us to sacrifice our most precious resource for oil tax.

4530 2018-03-19 14:58:58 Not asking SNP to have a crystal but am asking them not to base a fiscal plan on a volatile commodity, and not to do so and pretend that it is "just a bonus". There are many reasons why Scotland voted 'No'; this misrepresentation over oil revenue is just one reason.

4542 2018-03-19 14:56:53 The only thing keeping me going at this stage is David, those little steam bags of vegetables and coconut oil the rest of me is just a sack of shit x

4545 2018-03-19 14:56:44 Sadly millions like you believed the hype surrounding Trumps blustering speeches . Rather than taking a moment to examine his business past . If you had done this you would have realised he is nothing more than a card sharp/ flim flan man, a Snake Oil Salesman.
4546 2018-03-19 14:56:41 I’m really about to cop some CBD oil for my other vape dawg

4552 2018-03-19 14:55:37 Oil just got nuked. Good luck Spoos
4553 2018-03-19 14:55:31 Caution on OIL, going lower. Rejects key 62 test higher and going lower continues the 1D chart WEDGE. Break higher did not sustain from Friday. WEDGE very NARROW here has it fills out lower today.
4554 2018-03-19 14:55:25 Even now if you Google "DAPL Facts"  @Google takes you to slick Oil company paid websites burying actual Tribal factual websites.
4555 2018-03-19 14:55:20 I lunge yelling "Maybe you can kill puppies in Indiana but this is ELL EFFF KAAAY!!!!" He looses footing on the aforementioned hot oil and glides away, slip & slide style.
4556 2018-03-19 14:55:17 @jamesdmanning1 you’re forgetting the Russian oil company that is linked to the data cull.  You’re also forgetting how people on Facebook were targeted: Through the use of Russian trolls. It makes a difference in that it’s a piece of a larger conspiracy. Wake up.
4557 2018-03-19 14:55:06 Pretend it's snow. Oil builds up on the road and takes a while to wash off. Especially at intersections.
4558 2018-03-19 14:55:05 AKs are made all over the world these days. 

Or how about America pours in Stingers to the mujahedin of Afghanistan to kill more commies (the muj then became Al-Quaida eventually).

Or how about the Iran tensions came about because BP wanted to pay less for oil and just invaded?
4559 2018-03-19 14:55:04 The sun is out and I'm covered in coconut oil, I smell like a toasted marshmallow.
4560 2018-03-19 14:54:53 "The sun's nuclear reactor has produced all the oil, coal and gas over billions of years through photosynthesis, and will continue to produce vegetation for billions more. We've been harvesting these indirect forms of solar energy for all of human history" - @Dieter_Helm
4561 2018-03-19 14:54:45 I dropped an oil filler cap down into the engine bay, once.

Thank God, long arms.
4562 2018-03-19 14:54:33 Hi Jil, all of the palm oil Kellogg's uses is sustainably sourced and we are working with our suppliers to source fully traceable palm oil.
 Also, we are pleased to announce that our new W.K Kellogg range is completely palm oil free!
4563 2018-03-19 14:54:28 homeboy need more then coconut oil for them ashy ass hands and lips tf
4564 2018-03-19 14:54:20 Agreed...as demonstrated by Japan on the positive side and peripheral Europe on the negative, CA position is usually far more binding than the fiscal position.  Most ME producers still in the BOP black at $65-$70 oil, suggesting they are comfortable at the current equilibrium
4565 2018-03-19 14:54:20 oil tumbling with stocks... again
4566 2018-03-19 14:54:06 Maybe they shook the plants? Apparently that turns undetectable amounts of plant extract into insanely powerful snake oil.
4567 2018-03-19 14:54:01 No decision by high court today on injunction for oil company UKOG against protestors near its sites in south east England

4569 2018-03-19 14:53:46 I don't buy it.  The oil companies are not dumb.  More likely that that was a rationalization, and this is the old "innovator's dilemma" at work.
4570 2018-03-19 14:53:43 Nigerian oil & Gas is owned by foreigners & not benefiting Nigerians, ask the Niger Delta Avengers

4572 2018-03-19 14:53:30 Reading the comments of a public post is like willfully drinking boiling oil. You're not surprised by how you feel during the act, but it's painful just the same...
4573 2018-03-19 14:53:20 1. Abu Dhabi provides Dubai with the oil 2. Gulf is located strategically in the centre between asia and africa (easier for shipping/pipelines/transport) 3. UAE has one of the strictest regimes hard to be corrupt without getting punished. 4 Nigerian corruption
4574 2018-03-19 14:53:00 Ukraine’s Foreign Minister demands sanctions against Gerhard Schröder for pushing Putin’s projects overseas, Pavlo Klimkin told Bild. The former German chancellor chairs the Russian-controlled oil firm Rosneft and Nord Stream gas pipeline company. #Germany #Russia #Putin
4575 2018-03-19 14:52:58 @theresa_may @DavidDavisMP @MichelBarnier @CommonsEUexit @HouseofCommons I’m never voting again. You’re all a bunch of snake oil salesmen.
4576 2018-03-19 14:52:53 I use organic castor oil, the benefit of which is that it's known to promote hair growth... so if you want thicker, longer lashes (I mean, we're not talking fake-lash level, but slightly thicker, slightly longer), use castor!  But it needs to be organic. Get at Vita Health.
4577 2018-03-19 14:52:51 true. Mark Twain was a frequent visitor to this area. He knew Henry Huddleson who was a prominent business man who made his fortune in oil back in the 1800's.

They wont mention oil and gas of course
4586 2018-03-19 14:51:49 Oleochem ni cabang kimia yang fokus study dia belajar berkaitan proses minyak dengan lemak.. Dia berkaitan dengan palm oil sebab negara kita kan pengeluar minyak sawit, jadi, memang belajar pun fokus banyak kat minyak ni.. Tapi minyak dengan lemak jenis lain pun belajar jugak 
4587 2018-03-19 14:51:40 i followed up because i saw your other tweet about oil in your eyes.
4588 2018-03-19 14:51:34 Yes, it was difficult to get at. I was looking for some oil paint.
4589 2018-03-19 14:51:30 Someone told me i had to be dipped Fully in Water to be Truly Baptized and that Sign of the Cross thing they did to me with Anointing Oil was a Scam,I really don’t know how to feel.
4590 2018-03-19 14:51:27 So oil is a harm to the temple of God cause obesity, Coca-Cola is harmful to the temple of God no Coca-Cola, chocolates are harmful to the temple of God, etc so why attach drunkards only attack all
4591 2018-03-19 14:51:24 Sooo what restrictions has this admin placed on Venezuela??? Considering oil restrictions is NOT restriction! @SquawkStreet @SquawkAlley
4592 2018-03-19 14:51:22 Scott I am glad you are a champion of the energy sector. Can you please explain to me why we continue to buy Saudi oil? @MPRandyHoback won't return my calls or emails. I can't seem to get an honest answer from any federal politician about our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
4593 2018-03-19 14:51:13 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4594 2018-03-19 14:50:48 the oil cleansers i've used don't give me oily, cloudy eyes. also the removers often contain silicones that give it that slip/cloudy eye business, not necessarily the oils in them
4595 2018-03-19 14:50:46 if you own enough oil then yes
4596 2018-03-19 14:50:46 Things that cause me abnormal amounts of anxiety that shouldn’t: oil changes and car washes
4597 2018-03-19 14:50:32 i hate the feeling of oil in/near my eyes but i will do it if you tell me to
4598 2018-03-19 14:50:28 (鼻炎)薬が切れたか…
4599 2018-03-19 14:50:18 I never thought I'd see the day that our land would be just bassically given away to rape for oil and gas. This is a sacriledge.
4600 2018-03-19 14:50:15 わかりみ深い
4601 2018-03-19 14:49:55 I like the plain old recipe. Chickpeas, Garlic, Tahini, Olive oil, Lemon juice, Red chilli. Baas tevdhach.
4602 2018-03-19 14:49:55 I did take most of the stapler apart looking for a reason. I will oil it to see if that helps. Thanks.
4603 2018-03-19 14:49:54 You can use like jojoba oil or similar oils instead of makeup remover.
4604 2018-03-19 14:49:48 Thought I might watch @60Minutes last night. Then I saw the kiddos and the oil prince...turned that shit off. Two stories I don’t give a rip about.
4605 2018-03-19 14:49:33 What is inflation? Has their oil reserves wealth reduced coz there is "inflation"?
4606 2018-03-19 14:49:30 yes. yes. it might. ok you just need a new remover. i double cleanse with an oil cleanser first and then a foaming cleanser. if your aim to remove stubborn makeup, you can just oil cleanse your eye area and then rinse it clean. most any oil works, even plain old olive oil.
4607 2018-03-19 14:49:27 ごめん全然関係ないけどカニ食べたくなった
4608 2018-03-19 14:49:14 So I’m in the waiting room getting my oil changed and this little boy sits by me nudges me with his cast and says “I broke my arm but you’re pretty”  best pick up line ever

4613 2018-03-19 14:48:38 the key is to mist the skin suit at least thrice times a day, with a mixture of water, carbonation, and peppermint essential oil.

4617 2018-03-19 14:48:12 true true. ok still put the coconut oil in and if you go to a hair salon don’t let them put you under the dryer while you’re bleaching because that happened to me my first time and it killed my hair :((
4618 2018-03-19 14:47:54 Lol!  Just how are you going to fight the Democrats! I’m a Registered but Principled Republican & a Christian. And believe me, Trump is a narcissistic, lying, vindictive conman. Sounds like you are buying his snake oil sweetie!

4621 2018-03-19 14:47:44 That's definitely a factor, though I'm seeing the effect in counties that don't have oil and natural gas jobs as well. Things like less class based sorting of primary/high schools, cheap public universities, and generally low cost of living probably contribute as well.
4622 2018-03-19 14:47:38 They will continue to scatch & claw until #WeThePeople STOP them by not buying their "snake oil" for years WE lost OUR Voice ! THOSE DAYS ARE OVER ! Thank you @FoxNews & @seanhannity for keeping US informed !

4629 2018-03-19 14:47:08 Reminds me of the beautiful break even charts of a few years ago that "proved" that oil couldn't fall below $100 per barrel.

4636 2018-03-19 14:46:11 Why turn your clocks back when you can turn their entire life around with the right essential oil
4637 2018-03-19 14:46:10 Probably because you’re an evil, racist, white supremacist, male chauvinist, transphobic, lactose intolerant person.

4639 2018-03-19 14:46:05 Yet, I will not use the event to pour oil on SDF or SAA. 7 years. Unity really needed.

4669 2018-03-19 14:41:58 Yesterday I put a cotton bud in my ear & accidentally shoved a huge lump of wax/insect/crayon right down it. Now filling ear with warm olive oil. I didn’t think being a grown up would be like this.
4670 2018-03-19 14:41:55 gross. if you get tired of the oil patch that you call home hmu
4671 2018-03-19 14:41:55 Putin's oil gives Russia economic independence if they adopt the #OilStandard which in my analysis the US has now implemented. Using gold as support for trade clearing remains valid pending a new system. But as a reserve underpinning capital investment gold is inappropriate

4674 2018-03-19 14:41:28 Russia is a 'threat' because the West threatens constantly in Eurasia. Non-stop wars for control of oil. Brexit I suspect you'll survive. Far right extremists? What the 100 of them? You chose 'Islam' instead of 'Islamic extremists'. Why? I can't fathom why you chose that wording.
4675 2018-03-19 14:41:23 I hear that. I don't prefer pharma meds either. I take lithium orotate 5mg (diff than heavy duty lithium) which helps, along w/ other stuff that helps w/ depression like good quality fish oil, Vit B12 complex, stuff to help balance my hormones.

The stance is taken as read but what happens after 2018 is still open to conjecture and I'm sure suitably fraught ongoing talks.

4695 2018-03-19 14:38:30 My car is in the shop for some odd place oil leak. I’m glad they gave me a loaner car to get to work and everything, but this sucker is gonna cost like $816 to repair.  I’m so upset about it.

4697 2018-03-19 14:38:18 This is why they're referred to as scenarios and not forecasts. They show a notional future where oil demand peaks, or EV penetration reaches X%, etc. 

Also, important how folks use the scenarios (forecasts) in their own modeling..

4711 2018-03-19 14:37:03 BOTH. China's consumption, oil imports keep growing-- along w/ EV, as storage progress. ALL of China's cheap EV's use recyclable lead acid, Not expensive LI.

EV's don't include heavy equipment, aircraft, military and industrail consumption,
4712 2018-03-19 14:37:02 Seems like I've been letting the olive come to me for years, but I continue to rebuff her advances. It's funny, because I consider olive oil to be one of the great loves of my life. So many issues...
4713 2018-03-19 14:36:50 @luxmanara thanks for the coconut oil tip
4714 2018-03-19 14:36:47 But there is naturally a lack of accountability for a lot of people.  Some truly want to believe that they've not made any bad choices and the government is simply shutting down oil on them.  Trust me, I've worked with them.

4768 2018-03-19 14:30:50 Oil pricing is a unit of account (flow) question. Reserves are a store of value (stocks) question

4776 2018-03-19 14:30:05 It could be.. but things might be more and more errors if sooji keep flushes the oil in the fire of their misunderstanding

4793 2018-03-19 14:27:36 This cht shows what so few analysts understood in 2014 & understand to this day.  By pricing oil in non-USD & then stockpiling gold, Putin has given himself the ability to re-price his FX reserves in terms of his biggest output (energy) - IOW, economic independence fr the US/USD.

4831 2018-03-19 14:23:57 You know what pisses me off?! The fact that cars can run off corn oil yet the government likes making money off a type of fuel that is high in pollution & very harmful to this earth

4836 2018-03-19 14:23:25 Haha, wrong. You’re defending the guy who thinks there is such a thing as clean coal, people don’t know: Iraq has the largest oil reserve in the world, healthcare is hard, Lincoln was GOP. He thinks he invented “fake”. Not enough characters on twitter.
4837 2018-03-19 14:23:24 This sums up everything Trump <context: knowingly lying about his ratings> "Billy, look, you just tell them and they believe it. That's it: you just tell them and they believe. They just do." This is a con-man, nothing more. All of you that still support him, drink your snake oil
4838 2018-03-19 14:23:19 Rad! 
Honestly, I'm kind of jealous of your oil bill.......
4839 2018-03-19 14:23:16 Times report said Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant. Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters.

4841 2018-03-19 14:23:04 I don’t know whether it’s placebo effect but I feel like my lashes and brows are getting longer and fuller than usual from the castor oil.... miracle oil
4842 2018-03-19 14:22:54 Lush is pretty heavily greenwashed and has palm oil in it. I was hopeful about them bcs I've heard such good things.


4843 2018-03-19 14:22:53 Carco. Lightning McQueen, loses a race, has a crisis of confidence, dies and goes to the Carfterlife to meet his parents who tell him to go really fast because it was in his oil all along

4845 2018-03-19 14:22:49 Yes, I agree... sanctions... but that's just the beginning. We need to now build our military, nuke arsenal, place missile defense says in Europe. Cripple Russia's economy by flooding Europe with cheap oil n gas. Cyber attacks etc

4874 2018-03-19 14:19:05 @HLJiffyLube changed my oil, the car broke as a result, and they haven’t spoken to me or returned calls in 3 weeks. No one should ever go to Jiffy Lube again.
4875 2018-03-19 14:19:01 If I were Trump, I wouldn’t want to be black in America .. Why?  Because blacks in America own NO wealth, no gold, no oil, no trade, have no unity, no power, and no political or judicial influence and stupidly vote Democrat that keeps them that way.. Trump is fine they way he is.

4884 2018-03-19 14:17:40 Marriage, like a car, NEEDS SERVICING. The couple can self-service by collectively & constantly checking “the water, the oil, & making sure that the car is clean”. Then you may bring your marriage to a marriage counselor for deeper diagnosis, oil change & other key area checks.

4891 2018-03-19 14:16:08 I grew tomatoes a few years ago and had so much unripe I had to ripen and then dry in the oven then in oil. I'd say per red yoke I was running about €10 a piece.
4892 2018-03-19 14:16:04 Foraminiferal evolution is proven evidence of evolution. 
How do you think geologists find oil? They check for fossil evidence of things like foraminfera which have distinct features according to the time they lived.  You use gasoline and ignore that it took millions to form!

4897 2018-03-19 14:15:46 theyve become more than oil. they still have the trade routes, they are invested in western economies. id like to for what you said to be 100% true but I'm skeptical

4908 2018-03-19 14:14:13 Green technology is the wave of the future but elites can't profit off the sun, wind and land like they can with oil and war.  Converting more cars to electric would end wars quicker than trying to get Greedy corporations to do the right thing
4909 2018-03-19 14:14:07 When electric lobbyists have enough  
to out bid big oil legislation will be changed. 
You don’t expect big oil to keep paying if electric has taken over and someone has to fill the void. One thing for sure is corruption will not go away.
4910 2018-03-19 14:13:46 Have you looked at Lush's stuff? I don't know if they're as big in the US, but I adore their moisturisers. They don't test on animals and I'm pretty sure no palm oil in the one I use (but I'm not home to check for sure).

4912 2018-03-19 14:13:26 Oil, gas and petroleum accounts for approx 70% of Russia's exports. Let's drill more and export more oil? Let's target their economy? 
We have no idea what Trump has planned as far as retaliation. Time will tell. However we do know the previous administration did nothing
4913 2018-03-19 14:13:26 And send your sons out to die securing corporations foreign oil sources!?

And with a lot of oil. Israel attacked Iran several times in the past, with mutual distrust on both sides for many reasons.
4935 2018-03-19 14:10:51 Holy shit! Apparently I am going down to Texas tomorrow. I bring an empty down there, drop it. Pick up a different empty go to Oklahoma, load it with used oil and then bring it back to Council Bluffs. Is it going to be one hell of a week for miles.

4945 2018-03-19 14:09:28 After over 30 years in business, & many of those years have seen low oil, this battle is only partially to do w/ low oil. It’s being beat when we are already down.

Anyone have recommendations for light, (combination skin) palm oil free, not tested on animals skin care?

5065 2018-03-19 13:54:19 Natural Beauty Tip for Face Cleanser:- 

Rub a slice of grapefruit on the skin to make it more clean and glowing.

It reduces the excess oil from your skin and removes the particles of dirt and dust.
5066 2018-03-19 13:54:12 Natural Beauty Tip for Face Cleanser:- 

Baking soda is a great exfoliater and works great as a cleanser.

All you need is to add jojoba oil and honey to baking soda.

Use this for a week and see the difference.

5239 2018-03-19 13:33:46 Yes i think that demand for imported oil is higher since they have better quality and at a lower price compared to the local oil. I think the manufacturers abroad have managed to do this because of the economies of scale. I HAVE SEEN local manufacturers which produce high-

5287 2018-03-19 13:26:32 I think the first option is more likely. Israel’s future is with the post-oil Middle East (whatever form that will take);the US will take much less interest in Israel (and the Middle East in general) when oil is obsolete

5300 2018-03-19 13:25:04 2. if the issue is that bost Local and Imported Oil have the same Quality, and only difference is that due to Production scale of Imported Oil, it is cheaper, even after Tariffs compared to local oil which comes from small production scales, Then Tarrifs *might be the answer

Cleaning is one thing but damaging your skin or a healthy oil/probiotic balance is a good way to make things worse.

5656 2018-03-19 12:38:46 I will invest in agriculture. Palm fruits to be precise. After purchase, and processing, I will sell the palm kernel and the palm oil. The proceeds should be enough to purchase extra tonne. That way I will make more profit.

5680 2018-03-19 12:32:35 Seriously? You really think peace means that people taking bribes on passports, power stations, hospitals, oil, LNG tankers etc should go unpunished? That the people who ordered the murder of a journalist should go unpunished? And YOU claim to know what peace is? Unbelievable!
5681 2018-03-19 12:32:25 That was Corbett's idea with the gas tax. As of yet, Wolf hasn't raised taxes on any thing. U must be stupid if you'd rather pay the taxes instead of big oil, they have enough profits to keep them going- unless you work for oil.

5756 2018-03-19 12:21:56 Peace means that the people taking commissions on passports, power stations, hospitals, oil, LNG tankers etc. get prosecuted and if found guilty, jailed. Documenting that corruption is an act of political journalism and killing the journalist that does it is a political murder.

5771 2018-03-19 12:20:46 After a dry spell when it finally rains, you have to be careful. Oil collects on roads and water displaces oil. So when it rains, water soak in and oil comes to the surface of the road making them slick.

5893 2018-03-19 12:02:40 It has nothing to do with being out of gas.

The first sightings of bags on pumps was during the Oil Embargo in 1973.  Carter was in office.  Troubling times.

Because gas was in short supply, the bags were used by thieves who didn't want to leave their fingerprints behind.

5966 2018-03-19 11:51:03 I would think that an incident showing the extent of blatant criminality of tactics used by oil companies in acquiring Colorado land for fracking would have Colorado journalists salivating. Nope. Are they anticipating highest bid?

5979 2018-03-19 11:49:22 Butter > olive oil > margarine, canola, etc.

Neither is as good as bacon fat for frying an egg.
5980 2018-03-19 11:49:10 Cetaphil cream, it’s designed for people taking roaccutane for acne which removes every last bit of moisture from your body so it’s deeply moisturising but won’t block your pores causing further break outs. Also, mix an oil such as argan or jojoba in with your foundation 
5981 2018-03-19 11:49:07 Dishes aren’t bad, I always do the dishes. Sometimes I even have them done before sitting down to eat! But shallots, oh, yes ... on an earthenware dish surrounded by root vegetables, drizzled with olive oil and fresh herbs, roasted. Yum!

6093 2018-03-19 11:31:07 Investing in properties is a zillion times less complicated than oil and gas but how ex footballers prefer the later to the former always beat me. I am not against oil and gas business, it's just that you need advanced education and ruthlessness to trade in oil and gas.
6094 2018-03-19 11:30:38 The British took some oil palm from Calabar over a century ago, to Malaysia. I read this in Calabar history books as the Efik that I am.

In February 2018, the trade deficit narrowed to just $12 billion, in spite of a huge surge of 32% in oil imports.

6112 2018-03-19 11:27:59 I think the lithium market has been too small for the oil majors to care about thus far. Lithium revenues last were were ~$2B globally. XOM Q4 revenue was $67B. This plus the technical expertise needed for lithium chemical production are what has larger players hesitating IMO.

6128 2018-03-19 11:26:02 Could take a while. Moreover, as I understand it Russia's economy is overwhelmingly reliant on exporting oil and gas; when they eventually run out, unless it diversifies and modernises massively, it will be bankrupt - esp if keeps up its current level of military spending.

6186 2018-03-19 11:17:28 The herbalist gave her an oil and told her to massage it into her mother in law's shoulders every night for a month, and to wash her own hands afterwards. This would cause a toxic buildup that would kill the old woman.

6677 2018-03-19 09:42:10 If Climate Change is as devastating and catastrophic as is being described, why are we not moving to ban the IMPORTATION of oil and gas? Banning exploration does ZERO to reduce CO2 emissions in the forseeable future.

6684 2018-03-19 09:41:22 There is something the leaders are not telling us, I think we signed a secret pact to not refine crude oil...it would be obviously more lucrative to refine our own crude oil, why aren't we doing that ?

6686 2018-03-19 09:41:00 Of course I'm saying this while speaking in the most general sense. As a pwani oil products employee for instance, I do not expect you to be advocating for the sale of bidco oil products on the TL. I also expect you to use your company's products at home not the competitor's.

6703 2018-03-19 09:36:55 That’s right @dbseymour. I ask time and again what this does except to shift production offshore and to weaken the NZ economy, and oil and gas opponents can never give any form of compelling case.  The only winner of this sort of ban is the Saudis.

6778 2018-03-19 09:18:10 The rhetoric is there is no viable economic alternative to oil which is false. Dependence on oil irrespective of where it originates from must stop it is also about environmental degradation at source, not only emissions due to shipping from source to plant.

6780 2018-03-19 09:17:54 Not alone it won’t, no. Before too long we will also have to stop drilling for for oil and stop importing it too, because the future cannot include burning fossil fuels.

6790 2018-03-19 09:16:16 One of the things I find fascinating about DUBAI is its vision for the future. I followed a series of documentaries on @NatGeo about its economic trajectory. DUBAI's leadership KNOWS that OIL IS NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE, so they must 'build' fast and later on turn to tourism industry.

7320 2018-03-19 06:57:30 It’s a shame that solar doesn’t have the side dividends, like oil does, just think of all the lost revenue from arms sales, not just for us, but for exports to.
7321 2018-03-19 06:57:16 And no, we didn't use it, but I don't think it would have helped much - we tried washing with water earlier :) (Basically - water stuck in ear after swimming - sounds minor but more problematic with a damaged eardrum; needed an oil/acid-based solution to ease)
7322 2018-03-19 06:57:06 On what ground? Herdsmen no longer allow people to go to farm. He promised agriculture as alternative to oil but people are being killed by fulanis in their farms and at homes daily. Farm destroyed by cows and farm produce set ablaze. Whc foundation now?

7330 2018-03-19 06:53:22 Reshiram appears in legends. It seems not to attack enemies on its own, but the creator had trouble selling it to his coal miner clientele as tea, so it became possessed, ever searching for the one who threw it away so it can even flatten steel oil drums.

7453 2018-03-19 06:25:29 I agree with you but “hausawa” da kasa in your statement is unislamic fa. Its not because you are a muslim or hausa yasa baka threesome din even though that could have contributed,but kasani cewa akwai wadanda ba musulmai ba kuma ba hausawa ba that’ll never indulge in such!

7596 2018-03-19 05:56:12 Oil sweep the season series against MacGregor. Couple young bucks couldn't salvage their great goaltending tonight. @devinreinhardt announced he's backing out like a bitch next year. @rycksyappletree @carlwinslow19 slated to join the squad #paulandthegang #usedoilers
7597 2018-03-19 05:56:06 This is exceptionally worrying, as fracking will continue at current rates and expand due to US oil consumption and national security concerns. I knew that fracking had some harmful effects (contaminated groundwater, earthquakes, etc...), but this is new, thank you for the info
7598 2018-03-19 05:55:43 British never sent any Congress leader to Kala Paani where each prisoner was required to grind 20 pounds of oil every day by working in mill in place of oxen. Savarkar was doing that when Gandhi was lodged in Birla Bhawan & Nehru was enjoying VIP facilities in Jail @RahulGandhi

7606 2018-03-19 05:54:51 I took a social media break because I needed to finish a writing thing but instead spent that time covering my body from neck to toe in castor oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil and coconut oil because of an allergic reaction to bugs
7607 2018-03-19 05:54:29 They could’ve at least applied oil

7610 2018-03-19 05:54:13 Quite a bit, yea. 1) it’s not wonder bread—only a good artisan whole grain loaf 2) seasoning: garlic powder, pink salt, cracked pepper, cayenne 3) garnish: lemon juice, olive/sesame oil, black sesame seeds, smoked salmon, chopped egg, scallion, arugula, etc
7611 2018-03-19 05:54:05 Why don't they shut down ONE plant at a time. 
AND what about oil being sent from Alberta, or the USA - their plants aren't shut down.

7621 2018-03-19 05:51:51 .@OrrinHatch and @SecretaryZinke say #BearsEars reduction is to "help Utah schools". We call BS! Fucking idiots, we know full well the schools get 1% (or less), the oil companies get 99%, and they get their pockets lined. A wicked and corrupt generation.
7622 2018-03-19 05:51:35 Super dodgy. Head gasket cracks are usually diagnosable without pulling the head off (usually oil in coolant or coolant in oil)
7623 2018-03-19 05:51:29 Bahaha! Nobody is having any trouble selling barrels of oil Forrest! Keep dreaming
7624 2018-03-19 05:51:08 Losing water is a bad sign if there's no obvious leak. Should be bowing a little (or a lot) of white steam/smoke AND/OR the engine oil/coolant should have water/oil in it.

7636 2018-03-19 05:46:45 Is it losing water? Is it spewing steam? Has it lost power? How many KMs? Has it been low on oil or water in the near past? It's a shame but engines don't last forever, but you should expect 200-300KMs from a modern car engine.

7648 2018-03-19 05:43:56 Once built, assuming declining oil prices, pipeline owners will still have an incentive to lower shipping tolls to gets some revenues to recover some sunk costs, thereby enabling more years of production of oilsands. Assumption: oilsands GHGs/bbl don't materially decline.

7661 2018-03-19 05:39:26 pretty narrow views from those guys. Nothing about costs for climate change damage & Madgewick was shifty about numbers of those working in industry - how can it be better environmentally to keep drilling & using more oil & gas? That surely is far more dangerous.

7688 2018-03-19 05:32:57 Sis.. all you need is wheat flour, water and oil! Mix all of them in a bowl to make a firm dough, let it rest for 15 minutes, divide them into small balls, roll em out thin and cook em up in a pan! THATS IT
7689 2018-03-19 05:32:52 There's an oil field here, right?! Should we really be throwing bombs around?
7690 2018-03-19 05:32:34 We are now going to import all our oil\petrol because shipping it here is safer than taking it out of the ground ourselves.

7694 2018-03-19 05:32:00 ...4 years ago, oil was trading at over $100/bbl & dollar was over .90USD.

Fuel SHOULD be down about 30cents/litre from where it was then.

What ate up that 30cents+?

Taxes.

Remember to thank your govt, BC...it’s about to get a whole pile worse as oil prices recover.

7695 2018-03-19 05:31:59 I made two terrible LUSH-based mistakes in tonight’s bath.

2nd I took it out and threw in an actual bin that turned out to be blood red.

7738 2018-03-19 05:18:45 I want to see gas hit $4/L, businesses close and the tourism economy tank for about 6 months. Just so people understand how BC relys on the oil patch. I feel bad for the sensible people. But it's coming. BC will fall into one of the worst provinces in Canada economically. #TMX

7743 2018-03-19 05:17:02 Welcome @Adam_Sieminski we need to have a robust economic research that stands for the oil industry challenges and support “energy realism” notion to mitigate the world’s energy security concerns.

7752 2018-03-19 05:15:07 Interesting. Doesn’t seem to be much there. I mean, not much there that’s positive beyond what you’d get from a couple tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil. No? Possibly delicious though.

7757 2018-03-19 05:13:47 The censorship in Outlaw Star is so odd. People getting shot is almost never allowed, gore doesn't exist, yet a dude ripping off his broken cyborg arm, showing the stump and what is meant to be oil but is CLEARLY blood pouring down it is totally okay.

7883 2018-03-19 04:45:23 This brings up the issue of TFW, CNOOC Canada and Canadian-operated oil companies with strong staff/financial/etc ties to their US counterparts. Or at least it would, if I had any appetite to continue without booze. We can pick this up at Easter.
7884 2018-03-19 04:45:04 My favorite grocery store beauty buy is baby oil to remove my eye makeup!

7886 2018-03-19 04:44:58 Then go after the demand, don't go after our supply. You think that if we stop producing oil, Saudi, Venezuela, Russia et Al will stop producing oil that doesn't meet our human rights standards, let alone environmental standards? They won't, so we must be the world's #1 supplier

7888 2018-03-19 04:44:57 i had a mcd porridge before class then felt like wiping my mouth jn. saw some stains on the tissue so i thought “hmm my porridge had this much of chilli oil?” so i wiped harder.
turned out i wiped off my matte foundation.

and now my friend and I can’t stop laughing in class hELP

7890 2018-03-19 04:44:16 Yes. Scary
7891 2018-03-19 04:44:05 That is the point.  Expansion.  Also I believe the original pipeline ran real oil through it, not dilbit.
7892 2018-03-19 04:43:55 Can't seem to find an eye make up remover for my apparently v v sensitive under eye skin *and* remove mascara? Using micellar oil, gentle enough but soooo oily & still wake up with big smudges? Perhaps @petrarchsmuse you Know Things? Thinking of just avoiding mascara for ever but

7894 2018-03-19 04:43:36 A very real concern is that in developing countries this pseudo-science is being sold and marketed as a cure for all kinds of things.  People who have not had the advantages of education regarding healthcare are being bombarded with snake oil, basically.

7906 2018-03-19 04:42:11 Obama put sanctions on Russian oil after they invaded Ukraine. Then Russian oil company gets presentation from Cambridge Analytica on how to use CA data to overthrow a government. Trump and Russia partner with CA and Facebook and overthrow our government.
7907 2018-03-19 04:41:47 Damn.  That he can say that with a straight face is remarkable in and of itself.  Wht a snake oil salesman or simply a snake for short.

7917 2018-03-19 04:38:46 Absolutely nonsense.... Alaska is a textbook case of how not to manage oil windfalls. Norway IS an example of how to do that... sock the windfall away for future generations (oil's run will end one way or another). GOA must live on its day to day revenues bolstered by a 5% VAT.

7922 2018-03-19 04:37:43 This is why we CANNOT rely on nuclear energy to supply power for "Electric Cars". Oil waste clean up is terrible......BUT it doesn't last and destroy Billions of lives for billions of years. Radiation Sucks! Fukishima Anyone?
7923 2018-03-19 04:37:34 So your assertion is — just to be clear — that Tides Canada is being funded by its American counterpart, an environmental org, to stop the Kinder Morgan pipeline so unrelated American companies can have a larger share of international oil exports?
7924 2018-03-19 04:37:32 I had so many issues with my car in the summer that when I called the car repair shop to schedule an oil change the secretary asked me how college is going & can’t wait to catch up tomorrow
7925 2018-03-19 04:37:29 Not sure what the fan base is like, or if they were content on watching USL. Rochester had a long history of Pro Soccer. I watched them in the middle 70’s when I had ST for the old San Jose Earthquakes. I enjoyed the article. Sure looks like some snake oil salesmen in charge.
7926 2018-03-19 04:37:19 not only that...by this was U.S is planning to run kurdish oil from these area over ıraq/jordan to israel and meditteranian...

7929 2018-03-19 04:36:54 We need the money to pay social programs and we should also built it east and stop paying billions for dirty arab oil

7931 2018-03-19 04:36:34 The oil companies would pay a considerable amount tax and employ  a huge number of people. Government needs  to pay those dole Bludging, tree hugging  Greens, not to mention lifting all those children out of poverty, where 
do they think the money come from

7940 2018-03-19 04:34:36 I like ogx they have a volume one I think it’s purple and they’re under $10. Also use a bit of coconut oil on your hair after showers and when styling!
7941 2018-03-19 04:34:29 so I used organic coconut oil mixed with sugar as an exfoliator for my entire body & it is the BEST decision I've made this year. I. AM. GLOWING.
7942 2018-03-19 04:34:14 Jesus Christ. There are needs for oil. Not all needs should be used as it causes reactions inclement to survival. Amounts toxic is a level..

7991 2018-03-19 04:22:38 Seymour simply made the point that shutting down production here does nothing except to shift production elsewhere. We will import oil. And NZ loses the economic benefits of jobs and export revenue. You haven’t said what research will shows that is wrong.

7997 2018-03-19 04:22:01 Yes! I’d say try some lavender in your life. Compared to other oils, it is cheaper, but it works well for everything! Look it up! It’d be a great “gateway” oil if you find that it is useful to you.

8007 2018-03-19 04:19:43 Except a pipeline expansion will save few in the short term and no one in the medium term. Construction jobs will quickly end, there will still be a glut in world oil markets, oil prices will still be volatile, Alberta oil will still frequently sell at a lower price.

8018 2018-03-19 04:18:52 Well yes it is. Which means if Sessions lied about that then why should anyone believe the rest of his assertion? That’s like saying you should buy more snake oil after the first batch didn’t work

8087 2018-03-19 04:06:20 Trump-Kushner Crime Family continues to destroy other people's lives to accrue their own wealth.

 ”Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?” Indeed.
8319 2018-03-19 03:28:47 I can unequivocally advise how to handle if you bust a fish oil capsule in the pocket of a pair of jeans: Throw them out. 
Or you’ll think they’re clean/fixed but 2 hours after you put them on, you will be out somewhere and realise they are not

8323 2018-03-19 03:28:01 You'd think... if we went to war with Iran and Saudi Arabi and shut down the Straight of Hormurz... We could take a 20% share of the world's oil market out... that would be AMAZING for our profits. No one tell John Bolton

8325 2018-03-19 03:27:56 Take coco oil like the white paste rub it on the tips and let it sit for like the entire pride and prejudice movie and then wash it out. It should help 
8326 2018-03-19 03:27:43 Typical of liberal democrats to look up to that president. RFK took America into the Vietnam war where many young men were killed, let’s not forget about bay of pigs and the fact that family made money selling oil to Nazi’s during WWII.

8355 2018-03-19 03:23:34 PA is the only state in the country that has a robust fracking industry that DOESN'T tax oil companies. I would rather tax them for our bridges and roads instead of taxing OUR gas for them like Corbett did.

8469 2018-03-19 03:05:50 I think I need to do something about it, because I think oil doesn't come out. But what I wonder. I just need to get in the same frame of mind as taking a break for art and take a break to go find more places for lunch food.

8472 2018-03-19 03:05:33 bro it’s so hot in my room my coconut oil liquified 
8473 2018-03-19 03:05:18 My family been there.  Saudi has no option but to change. can no longer depend on oil.  Lk 4 women to drive, work, entertainment - don't look 4 justice system change. -Let's see if they put Christian Ch up - Qatar, Dubai,have. Crown Prince is ruthless, executions, arrest, torture
8474 2018-03-19 03:05:06 The Pixi Glow Tonic is a good glycolic toner, great reviews from many experts. At target. Trilogy rosehip oil isn't the cheapest, but you only need a few drops as a nighttime moisturizer. Natural source of vitamin C. And smells nice.
8475 2018-03-19 03:05:05 If the figures are correct we’re selling off our children and grandchildren’s inheritance - that isn’t ours to sell off. Like oil in Saudi Arabia - pure drinking water from NZ is our ticket out of debt and poverty. So why can’t we just make all water bottling plants public assets
8476 2018-03-19 03:04:44 vape oil. Please I must see
8477 2018-03-19 03:04:38 So, testing out my lipbalm, I can describe it as:
-Feels like rubbing vaseline on your lips, not the 'dry' feeling like chapsticks
-Lips look very shiny because beeswax-to-oil content is less than your normal over the counter stuff
-melts on contact; effortless glide on lips
8478 2018-03-19 03:04:11 The climate science is plain: we need a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to avoid a climate catastrophe. And we have the technology to do exactly this. stopping the search for more oil is the first step.
8479 2018-03-19 03:03:51 These three do realize they’re part of the wealthy class....right??
8480 2018-03-19 03:03:42 I need some oil
8481 2018-03-19 03:03:40 Running low on my cbd oil capsules. Where I can I just get a pen & oil so I’m not constantly buying capsules???
8482 2018-03-19 03:03:19 Aye boy you don’t need no more of that oil boy
8483 2018-03-19 03:03:14 #SupportTheNRA
8484 2018-03-19 03:03:07 today my mom told that she's been using the grapeseed face oil that I left at their place and she loves it and her co-workers all commented on how well it was working and she bought a bunch in bulk and gifted it them to her co-workers
8485 2018-03-19 03:02:45 And now we know the Russian troll farm went for Pm over oil, spreading stupidity about Castro etc. I have screenshots of a guy today who said PET was a Nazi. Even showed a fake pic. Unbelievable.
8486 2018-03-19 03:02:44 I put lavender oil (and grapefruit oil) in my mop water once a month or so. Is that too much exposure?
8487 2018-03-19 03:02:37 That’s true, but for the few jobs that aren’t subsidized by Saudi oil money it’s important that there’s equal pay.
8488 2018-03-19 03:02:35 I've never understood why people don't understand why putting oil on your face is not a good idea.
8489 2018-03-19 03:02:30 I know it's cool to say "computers are bad lol" but, like, I'm starting to realize that engineering across the board is the same.

I just made a small shim to stick in a oil line to prevent oil starvation to an motor top end. This was suggested in a Yamaha tech bulletin.
8490 2018-03-19 03:02:29 誰がクソビッチだ
8491 2018-03-19 03:02:27 i just figured out that the syrup i put on my waffles this morning was actually leftover oil.
8492 2018-03-19 03:02:07 guys who use baby oil to wank off must have like super moisturized dicks, this stuff actually works wonders
8493 2018-03-19 03:02:03 exactly what does that mean, 'actively considering'? Its time now to end oil & gas exploration, this world needs no more it may already be too late to save the planet from catastrophic destructive from 'climate change'
8494 2018-03-19 03:01:58 What’s the point ! They do exactly what they want at the expense of others ! Ask why they haven’t stopped bombing in Yemen and how they allow Assad’s to continue killing ! Wait til Russia comes for your oil !
8495 2018-03-19 03:01:49 “Turkey never sold ISIS oil!!! I swear on Erdoğan!!!”
8496 2018-03-19 03:01:45 my dads face has so much oil on it an I gave him a makeup wipe to clean it an he said “I feel like a brand new bitch”  I’m fuckin cryin I hate my dad 
8497 2018-03-19 03:01:40 Fried foods are being chemically change once it hits.the oil, so all the cells are burnt and gonna cause cancer - liberal talk

8503 2018-03-19 03:00:38 @CBSThisMorning The Crown Prince has got to diversify... oil might go to hell. If a business man is good 4 Saudi than why not US? Norah shows how naive she is abt segregation, how lucky women in USA are. Interesting how much CBS respects religion outside USA except Christianity.
8504 2018-03-19 03:00:12 OIL DIFF: 3.91 -> 3.93

Nigga on the Phone: “So you want me to put some baby oil on yo ass?”
8508 2018-03-19 02:59:41 She's completely delusional! US was once a strong economic power, they became shit in 70's with the oil sanctions of OPEC. As well as the reduction of local manufacturing of Auto and steel ect in modern days. It needs to return to its former glory.
8509 2018-03-19 02:59:29 oooo you can put mini lipsticks or lip stains, or even oil blotting wipes bc they’re daily needs???
8510 2018-03-19 02:59:21 She mean lil ashli oil?
8511 2018-03-19 02:59:20 seriously this cough syrup is like a congealed blend of rotten plums, fish oil, and battery acid 
8512 2018-03-19 02:59:14 U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for the seventh time in the last eight weeks on expectations crude prices in 2018 will top 2017, prompting more drillers to boost spending plans for this year.
8513 2018-03-19 02:58:26 nice chart. what's your take on oil?
8514 2018-03-19 02:58:25 Idk what's going on internally w me atm but my face oil god bless tha bees .
8515 2018-03-19 02:58:20 I was gonna oil paint outside tomorrow but I guess not 
8516 2018-03-19 02:57:35 #Oil prices fell as rising drilling activity in the United States pointed to further increases in output, raising concerns about a return of oversupply.
8517 2018-03-19 02:57:32 Oil down 0.5% after 2% spike on Friday

8518 2018-03-19 02:57:26 This would be super funny if I wasn't living in an oil town that is being destroyed by this complete nonsense.  Thank you Steve please fight on @SteveSGoddard
8519 2018-03-19 02:57:20 Gas is $1.29/L in Prince George, $1.26/L in Toronto, $1.41/L in Montreal. In Vancouver? Why, right around the same price as when oil was $100/barrel. $1.68/L and expected to keep climbing. This place is ridiculous.
8520 2018-03-19 02:57:19 Russian oil... hmm. Something Carter Pagey about that.
8521 2018-03-19 02:57:09 Ha! No one is buying your snake oil lady.

You do realize that The FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) recommended Andrew McCabe’s firing. 

And The head of the OPR Candice Will was appointed to the position by none other than Robert Mueller.
8522 2018-03-19 02:57:02 Its to smoke concentrated weed (dabs, oil, resin - anything made of weed) out of.

8528 2018-03-19 02:55:36 I wonder how much you'd have to do that before it's cheaper to buy a home-scale theatre-style popcorn machine and flavacol (the stuff theatres add to the oil that makes theatre popcorn taste like theatre popcorn)?
8529 2018-03-19 02:55:31 I kept telling all the way that you were paid by the opposition to tweet on their behalf. Eventually the truth like oil comes to the surface. People will see magets as they are. @rumaalu2
8530 2018-03-19 02:55:22 I thought economics was your thing? 98% of South Sudan's government revenue is crude oil. I'd expect you'd know, there's not much demand for subsistence farmers (most of the rest), in inner Melbourne. It's not an easy process.

8534 2018-03-19 02:54:57 Mix caster oil, coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil and put them on them.  They will FLOURISH.

8539 2018-03-19 02:54:27 Umm..... Clean energy employs more workers then either coal or oil.  If any one isn't supporting American energy workers it's those fighting to prevent the inevitable transition.
8540 2018-03-19 02:54:08 Um... the investors were in Canada, they were prepared to create oil and pipeline jobs.
to the tune of 260 BILLION DOLLARS! 
Then, between Justin’s extra hoops, taxes and interference, along with “environmentalists” extra regulations, they left Canada and to their $$$ elseware!
8541 2018-03-19 02:53:44 Oh and I consume the oil probably at least a half hour before I go to sleep as apart of a routine
8542 2018-03-19 02:53:34 Fuck it, lets give em all the oil available
8543 2018-03-19 02:53:06 YOU GOT THIS GRANDMA
8544 2018-03-19 02:52:58 Our respects and appreciations for your support, mr McCain, we know, you know that  #Putin’s post-Soviet mafia state #Russia is not so strong military nor economically, you can’t build a superpower based just on corrupt elites and oil/gas revenues, the West should act more tough
8545 2018-03-19 02:52:23 It takes some experimenting to find what brand and serving works for you. For sleeping I use CBD Plus oil and each squirt is .5 mgs, depending on the night I’ll have four squirts or ten
8546 2018-03-19 02:52:19 THE CBD OIL IS GIVEN TO CHILDREN AND BABIES THAT HAVE SEICURES. PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ARE ACTUALLY HAVING TO MOVE TO THE STATES WHERE CANNIBIS IS LEGAL IN ORDER TO GET THERE CHILDREN TREATED WITH THIS MIRACLE CURE.

8555 2018-03-19 02:51:29 When you use Vaseline and castor oil for your hair, now that's black.
8556 2018-03-19 02:51:25 Wha!!!! Cannabis oil massage?? How was it? I usually use grapeseed oil for body, and eat hemp oil.

8559 2018-03-19 02:51:04 This may sound weird but making your own PB is highly underrated. You just put raw peanuts in a blender, can also add brown sugar or coconut oil. You’ll never buy PB again
8560 2018-03-19 02:51:01 Yes preferably almond oil or vitamin e cream
8561 2018-03-19 02:50:44 Let's not forget, this is all about oil isn't it. Somewhere, somehow along the way, it always comes back to big oil. Am I right? @RexTillersonWH @ScottPruittOK
8562 2018-03-19 02:50:33 Not if you live in Vancouver & understand the economy of this city relies on a safe, working, & clean harbour, for other industrial users of the harbour, tourism, & intl image. Can you imagine what would happen if there was a major spill of oil here, now assume it's #bitumen
8563 2018-03-19 02:50:32 i’m tryna leave this tunnel in tho! cause i’ve tried stretching to this size 3 times and it’s always torn. i’ll try a sea salt soak and then bactine and coconut oil after!
8564 2018-03-19 02:50:28 From the article...
Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.
8565 2018-03-19 02:50:08 Eventually climate change will put every job at risk because it puts our planet at risk - didn't say that's happening right now in 'world ending' fashion. But phasing out oil extraction is a good step we can take right now in preparation for that reality down the track
8566 2018-03-19 02:49:54 Venezuela is now pricing oil in Chinese Yuan, shunning USD. China, Russia, Iran etc. hard-buying what can’t be sanctioned: gold and silver. Many countries repatriating it. Russian sanctions have unintentional but real drawback accelerating an end of USD global reserve hegemony.
8567 2018-03-19 02:49:46 How do you use the CBD oil? Recently acquired some; I legit have no idea how it works but have heard it’s good for stress?
8568 2018-03-19 02:49:16 Foreign sources run by corrupt govts with poor environmental records!  So not such a great idea importing oil from these places costing NZ more in balance of trade deficit and destroying local jobs.  Oh, and costing the govt precious tax and royalty from oil and gas production!
8569 2018-03-19 02:49:12 @PreetBharara Not really a legal question but...the way Tillerson was dismantling our state department...Exxon reps still there in other countries (at least those w/oil) to represent "America"? Was this his mission/plan all along?
8570 2018-03-19 02:48:25 No but you do need them to find oil! (Black gold, Texas Tea)
8571 2018-03-19 02:48:19 Olive oil and black soap might be the recipe.
8572 2018-03-19 02:48:15 Checkin that oil
8573 2018-03-19 02:48:11 Underwater tunnel now, last time I heard they want to build a new port including oil pipelines.
8574 2018-03-19 02:48:02 I decided to try cooking butternut squash, but I just tossed it in olive oil, salt and pepper and put it in the oven....so here goes 
8575 2018-03-19 02:47:59 Also illogical.  Why did you bring *this up if you thought the tar goes to China and India.  btw, where is your source for it going to India?    *”Don’t worry washington state can supply us with all the oil we need!”
8576 2018-03-19 02:47:57 I like making Avocado toast with 1 slice of wheat bread toasted, 1/2 Avocado sliced, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Delicious!!#SugarFreeChallenge
8577 2018-03-19 02:47:42 In a FB group on alt med: woman tells another woman to treat yeast infection with cbd oil and vaginal ozone therapy. FFS! By alk means please be miserable instead of getting a prescription for diflucan.

8579 2018-03-19 02:47:18 I was gonna RT this but didn’t wanna advertise anymore for them
8580 2018-03-19 02:47:12 Absolutely! We will pollute our shores with oil spills, along with the pristine Arctic preserve. Not to mention coal sludge polluting streams and all industry polluting the air. Oh yes, great place to live, if you can breathe.
8581 2018-03-19 02:46:59 اسأل الله لكِ الثبات وأن يحذو الاخوات حذوك ، وحذو الصحابيات وأن يكُن صالحات مصلحات في هذا الزمن الذي كثرت فيه الفتن

8583 2018-03-19 02:46:41 And CA subsequently had a meeting with Russian oil company Lukoil. It was supposed to be about the local soccer team, but all they wanted to talk about was using CA to sway election results. So CA sent them all their information on how to use FB to sway an election. Good job boys
8584 2018-03-19 02:46:09 Specific Amino Acids as highlighted in Dr. Longo’s book the Longevity Diet are going to be more influential, but carbs/blood sugar is a contributor. Fats that raise cholesterol are dangerous, however Lorenzo’s Oil was interesting case study, some fats might be protective.
8585 2018-03-19 02:45:48 My shitty roommate ends up making the whole living room smokey even with the window open. He really needs to invest in cooking oil.
8586 2018-03-19 02:45:47 Fine then coconut oil 
8587 2018-03-19 02:45:43 The Siege of Leningrad, Moscow, and most notably Stalingrad (Hitler was after the oil in the south) were absolute slaughterhouses on both sides. 

Germany with its mechanized blitzkrieg & Russia with its wave after wave of conscripts.

8589 2018-03-19 02:45:15 Because Venezuela has that oil
8590 2018-03-19 02:45:10 I just remembered why I don't like putting oil in my hair at night 
8591 2018-03-19 02:44:59 Ummm... Creepy. Is that allowed??? 
A mechanic once got my number from the customer files after I got an oil change, started texting me and I got his ass fired.
8592 2018-03-19 02:44:56 Does she even know what exactly Flynn was caught lying about? No. Olive Oil is no patriot-maybe Flynn shouldn’t be representing foreign nations and lying about it while in office? How about that
8593 2018-03-19 02:44:12 Bwahahaha! Are they REALLY that oblivious? Dump the motherfucker in an oil spill.
8594 2018-03-19 02:44:12 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
8595 2018-03-19 02:44:11 Oil cleansers are the best. The face shops light cleansing oil is my goto
8596 2018-03-19 02:44:11 I double my cup like i double my efforts to milk the land of spoil,im fresh smelling like Tom Ford macking this lady wile checking my oil,these monsters around me is business,oun really think much of em,cause everybody that say they yo dawg you can't just automatically trust em!
8597 2018-03-19 02:44:04 There are people in City Hall who deserve boiling in oil for the way they have warped the SSE debate, although I would use only waste oil lest a deserving batch of would-be frites might otherwise go wanting.
8598 2018-03-19 02:43:58 This oil has my beard feeling extra soft and luxurious
8599 2018-03-19 02:43:49 I’ve smelled something for the first time in days! It’s the not so pleasant smell of the vitamin E oil I put on my raw nose but I’m so excited that I may be able to taste the tea I’m making.

8602 2018-03-19 02:43:14 How ignorant must one be that when oil is doing well, the trickle effect serves to benefit everyone. This province is not set up nor has the revenue to become a multiple trick pony.

8611 2018-03-19 02:42:04 You gotta start somewhere. I'm not a radical who says we need to end our dependency on oil right now. But stopping the drilling of oil in our own back yard is a good place to start :)
8612 2018-03-19 02:41:38 Pash tb her auntie she gone say “she all about that god shit she put that god oil on me “ she tb she in the car blew

8617 2018-03-19 02:40:53 You know when you hear that cooking oil sizzle it's lit 
8618 2018-03-19 02:40:37 oooo i’ve never tried olive oil! once i’m done with my castor oil i’m gonna check it out
8619 2018-03-19 02:40:22 If it's that serious then why are we not proposing a banning on oil IMPORTATION

8622 2018-03-19 02:39:54 i got tea tree oil in my eye & madalyn is stressing me out help
8623 2018-03-19 02:39:51 Barry, I recommend elderberry syrup and oregano oil to help his immune system.
8624 2018-03-19 02:39:50 I don’t understand the hype around coconut oil. It did nothing for my hair and I definitely wasn’t putting it on my face. Skin care twitter is in shambles right now.
8625 2018-03-19 02:39:39 Just saying I feel that. Once you start using beard oil it’s like you got promoted to a whole new level of the beard game.
8626 2018-03-19 02:39:21 i’m allergic to baby oil... like come on BABY OIL 
8627 2018-03-19 02:39:03 Exfoliate & oil your body down after  baby girl
8628 2018-03-19 02:39:03 Dawn is used by wildlife agencies & volunteers to clean animals affected by oils spills. It’s gentle enough not to harm the wildlife but gets rid of the oil & sludge on these poor animals caught up in it~
8629 2018-03-19 02:39:01 I met him, about a year ago, I was seeing a Major M.P. and his friends gave him a retirement Party, in Virginia, he's originally from West Texas, he flys his own Helicopter, he has 2 of them, his little Cow calf operation, is 18,000 acres, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and 3 oil wells
8630 2018-03-19 02:38:55 Thank god I took drama class in 11th grade now when the guy changing my oil shows me that stick thing I can nod and  pretend I see it too
8631 2018-03-19 02:38:09 I think I will just stick to the baking soda and coconut oil facial remedy!
8632 2018-03-19 02:38:08 Exactly!  And the price of oil / barrel is no longer relevant in today's pricing. Just tonight from East Van to Surrey I saw 146.9, 150.9, and 154.9 just nuts!
8633 2018-03-19 02:37:56 Kemaren2 banyak yg ngomongin natural pacific, tp pas aku baca review sana sini. Khasiatnya hampir sama kaya rosehip oil ga sih
8634 2018-03-19 02:37:45 Put coal and seacans on rail, lumber and other forest products. Ag products. Oil and gas belong in pipelines as much as humanly possible. Much safer for everyone and the environment too.  #abpoli #KinderMorgan #bcpoli #cdnpoli

8637 2018-03-19 02:37:22 Interesting point indeed!Could there be alternatives to producing profits/equalization for the few&the many other than oil?Is diversification useful across platforms?Great conversation! Being right is not the point from this perspective,engaging in convo is!
8638 2018-03-19 02:37:05 This ends badly for black folk. When they drive all the productive, knowledge folks off the land, they are the one that suffer.  Please see Zimbabwe

8640 2018-03-19 02:36:26 Hard to tell.  If China presses ahead and launches PetroYuan Gold backed oil contracts it could send a message to sell Dollars.  Launch mooted for 26th March 2018.

8643 2018-03-19 02:36:09 human over dolphin ffs, and it isn't a dying fuel, peak oil my arse lol. "spills waste" acceptable minimal risks
8644 2018-03-19 02:36:01 Notley is playing the people of Alberta for all she can. Trying to sound like she is fighting for the oil industry while just behind her, her own people are effectively shutting it down. I honestly can not fathom her level of contempt for the province and it's people.

8646 2018-03-19 02:35:47 Find a camelina oil product! They work really really well.
8647 2018-03-19 02:35:35 I like how @LeBatardShow thinks that they stopped making spin offs.

8648 2018-03-19 02:35:33 yo @asapmarinaa i bought that rimmel “oil” spice lipliner from your vid cute shade
8649 2018-03-19 02:35:18 Ummm perhaps braised beef, stir fried asparagus tips in garlic and olive oil, baby potatoes topped w a tzatziki/hollandaise fusion sauce?
8650 2018-03-19 02:34:56 I worked with her once in 2015. She walked into rehearsal and quickly made everyone leave the room...she also drank olive oil in between takes and was extremely negative overall. Show turned out great though!

8654 2018-03-19 02:34:24 If i take a shower right now, im going to just knock out. But im so icky and greasy from the oil change LMAO...
8655 2018-03-19 02:34:20 一緒にすんなこら
8656 2018-03-19 02:34:05 After that dove and baby oil treatment, I’m feeling all moisturized 
8657 2018-03-19 02:33:49 environment risks aren't worth it for a dying fuel. Killing the Maui dolphin, oil spills, waste, the risk doesn't stack up to those that are sane.
8658 2018-03-19 02:33:35 Like pipelines are bringing oil for use in BC. #naive
8659 2018-03-19 02:33:16 So I put baby oil in my bath water and bust my ass when I got in 
8660 2018-03-19 02:32:40 and whilst they wait, the planet dies a little more each day. 
What can be so hard in giving a date (how about 1 September 2018) for the end of gas/oil exploration?
8661 2018-03-19 02:32:32 Frying pan. Add a little oil and toss them on high heat for few minutes. Heats them up really well and if you cook a little longer you can make them crispier than they were originally too. Can even add additional spices like pepper or paprika!
8662 2018-03-19 02:32:27 Well, so far, they're not helping him get accepted to colleges. He's getting turned down everywhere, it seems.
8663 2018-03-19 02:32:14 So lavender and tea tree oil are good for the boobies
8664 2018-03-19 02:31:56 The one I use is more like an oil really. I might need something with a bit more control.
8665 2018-03-19 02:31:54 Says the person supporting a man/party trying to tell states how to run themselves, trying to force guns on public schools, selling off state lands to oil/gas/mining industry, handing out tax cuts to rich, increasing Americans debt by multiple trillions...shall I go on?
8666 2018-03-19 02:31:49 Easiest maybe, but it may not take and if you’re really good with it go ahead, but I’m still getting the implant. {I moan softly as I browse the desserts} I’m thinking the roasted garlic and oil dipping sauce to start?{smiling as the server fills my wine glass I continue looking>

8678 2018-03-19 02:29:49 Now that Pruitt has has done whatever he could to destroy the environment and cashed his checks from the oil industry, he is aiming for a job that he is even more unqualified for. VOTE in Nov--ALL Republicans up for re-election or election have to go. No exceptions.
8679 2018-03-19 02:29:34 If I heard @JoyAnnReid right, Facebook gave user (and friends of friends of friends) data to Cambridge Analytics which gave it to a Russian *oil* company . . . to target voters.  And we would buy gas from Lukoil why?
#NyetLukoil
8680 2018-03-19 02:29:25 Might as well get an oil change tomorrow
8681 2018-03-19 02:29:13 We have tons of water and plenty of sun. 
I doubt we'll run out of electricity as long as we have a govt that is prepared to get rid of oil and gas electricity and put $$$ into sustainable sources of energy.
8682 2018-03-19 02:29:08 Lavender oil... my best friend tonight ...
8683 2018-03-19 02:29:05 Coconut oil is growing my baby hair like crazy
8684 2018-03-19 02:28:41 if you don't have an environment and peoples health the oil and gas is worthless
8685 2018-03-19 02:28:04 Society doesn’t import oil, companies do. And they do it because it makes competitive sense to do so.
8686 2018-03-19 02:27:32 Tinned sardines in olive oil, mix gently with lemon juice, dill (or other fave fresh herbs), pepper, salt, red pepper flakes. Spoon on baguette. So good.

8694 2018-03-19 02:25:17 Thoughts on futures here? Surprised to see Nasdaq and oil down - guess futures always lay bait and switch
8695 2018-03-19 02:25:07 Make sure to wear black tomorrow to represent oil. Watch OTV for our intro to green week where the devastating affects oil has on our environment who'll be shared, and what YOU can do to help save our oceans!
8696 2018-03-19 02:24:41 Trump is a sham, promising the opposite of what he has delivered, running on a pack of lies, losing the vote, and installed by hackers rigging the process. Get off your snake oil box, and pack it in.

8702 2018-03-19 02:23:50 In the 1970's, oil prices were high, so USSR was able to sustain itself by financing these exports through its oil revenues. However, in the 1980's, oil prices dropped significantly. It was able to sustain itself through relying on the debt markets for some time...

8714 2018-03-19 02:22:32 It happened to me too I went to aamco for a oil change and they caught it and plugged it.
8715 2018-03-19 02:22:20 Oh! and we give them fish oil too!
8716 2018-03-19 02:22:11 @nerdycreep Thanks for the retweet to David Lynch. Actually, I've since found it's a better "kick" to mix in coconut oil with coffee. Try it!!

8723 2018-03-19 02:20:51 What? US Environmentalists just shut down an expansion of oil exports out of Washington State. Just as Canadian Environmentalists will shut down an expansion of Dilbit exports out of Burrard Inlet.
8724 2018-03-19 02:20:47 No oil moving or produced means less resource revenue for governments. Profits for the few? We all profit from equalization. Where do you think that money comes from? Windmills, AI or ????? Respond.

8730 2018-03-19 02:20:24 Not that law... The one that let this happen in the first place. And speaking of damage, consider the property damage from an oil spill.

8735 2018-03-19 02:19:52 I need to watch it to be honest... we were in the car on the way back from @Disneyland & @ACSupdates this week, so we only heard it on radio... from what I've heard/read so far, my answer would be yes...
8736 2018-03-19 02:19:48 Sorry sport. Anyone that wilfully puts known lies and Big Oil financed narratives like this one ( tar sands are the biggest source of carbon emissions on the planet, and easily the biggest polluting way to get oil ) earns an immediate block.

8766 2018-03-19 02:15:56 It's now being taught that being fat is beautiful. And it was the government that told everyone that simple sugars are good for you, & fat (i.e. butter, oil) is bad for you. I'd rather not pay for insurance for people that refuse to take care of themselves.

8803 2018-03-19 02:10:29 Not sure I understand this, but I think you're saying that the oil companies would lose a lot of money. 

Yeah... too bad for them.
8804 2018-03-19 02:10:25 I roasted it. Cut the cabbage head into slices then drizzled with olive oil, kosher salt, black pepper, and granulated garlic. Depending on how thick they are, it takes about 30-45 minutes. I like mine crusty though so I go longer.

8816 2018-03-19 02:08:41 It's ironic that the oil and gas was created out of a low oxygen CO2 rich planet hundreds of millions of years ago. You may call those conditions on earth back then "wrecked" also. It's a matter of perspective.

8827 2018-03-19 02:06:40 sit in the bath for 20 minutes with a handful of epsom or sea salts, 10 drops of lavender essential oil, and a half cup of baking soda. It draws out toxins, reduces stress, and balances your pH levels.  #PositiveVibesOnly
8828 2018-03-19 02:06:38 Been seeing a lot about not using coconut oil on your face.  

Possibly because my face is already super oily is seems unbothered by it + I only use it as a makeup remover followed by my cleaner.

8860 2018-03-19 02:01:38 Notice what I was suggesting we take away. Things directly made from oil - Their phones, sunglasses, lotions, rubber on shoe soles, clothing made of polyester etc etc. This is what THEY are protesting. Holding people directly accountable works very well to create an awareness.

8874 2018-03-19 02:00:04 Not if it is replaced with other jobs over a period of time. Oil and gas aren't renewable and I'm not sure if you noticed, but the planet is wrecked and we are running out of time. We have to start somewhere. Bad enough the US has an attitude like you - money over everything.
8875 2018-03-19 01:59:49 Apparently that's acceptable to BC NDP......it's not Alberta oil.
8876 2018-03-19 01:59:41 That is what I have been trying to tell him. We spend one billion dollars a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have money for the military but they want to get assistance for heating oil for the poor.
8877 2018-03-19 01:59:00 When you smell really good oil... and it makes your nostrils orgasm.

8881 2018-03-19 01:58:45 The recent @WorldBank report on India has this very reassuring take on Oil, which IMHO is the biggest external risk we face

"Given the benign prognosis of oil prices, a further large hike in oil prices and its fall out on the Indian economy is *not* perceived to be a major risk"

8887 2018-03-19 01:56:25 But we both know what was really behind this.  Syrian territorial integrity is secondary to Russia's need for oil pipelines and economic boosts for their failing economy, courtesy of Turkey.
8888 2018-03-19 01:56:22 now if u excuse me im gonna take a lavender oil bath and watch queer eye
8889 2018-03-19 01:56:17 I don't use K&N filters anymore as some research has been done that puts in question how well those filters filter and some oil tests show traces of silica from oils of the filter getting into the motor oil.
8890 2018-03-19 01:56:13 i have lawn mower oil in my hair.
8891 2018-03-19 01:55:52 Ya boy got a new career as a floorhand on a oil rig as well

8893 2018-03-19 01:55:23 Another day of hoping the black oil from the x files infects my piece of shit neighbors and... I don't really remember what that shit even did but I think it made the people less loud so if thats the case thsts what I hope happens to them. Or they move.
8894 2018-03-19 01:55:22 BABY OIL!
8895 2018-03-19 01:55:18 ...added spices fried in olive oil: garam masala, cayenne, cinnamon, ginger, cumin. Blended it all up on high in a blender. Served warm or cold.
8896 2018-03-19 01:55:10 Brilliant video, thanks for that. Don't forget to use THC oil Stephen. I'm sure you're up on all this. X

8898 2018-03-19 01:54:35 
8899 2018-03-19 01:54:24 Mmm, dunno how much I'm willing to concede on that. Prior to Operation Ajax you still had decades of British oil interests converging with Great Game maneuvers against Russia involving Iran

8903 2018-03-19 01:53:53 I picked up some anima-infused vegetables today. They're quite delicious in salads. Sweet and nutty, a bit of an oil aftertaste but still not bad.

8906 2018-03-19 01:53:31 Or... or... you’re just lying to yourself. The first step is admitting you’re a dope. Humanities biggest issue is global climate change. As long as we’re still messing with coal and oil, were bound to leave this planet; painfully.
8907 2018-03-19 01:53:25 The Saudis have their currency tied to the dollar and are obliged to sell their oil likewise. The world moves forward slowly, but it is moving, and away from the dollar. The idea of the Petroyuan is to move to a collateral based currency, something accepted by all.

8914 2018-03-19 01:50:56 It’s also important to remind people that all provinces benefit from Canada’s crude oil exports fetching fair value and would benefit from the project going ahead.
8915 2018-03-19 01:50:36 Nothing sadder than my oil finishing 
8916 2018-03-19 01:50:36 Yall shouldn't compare a country that produces 30% of the world's oil (Saudi), with a country that produces 30% of the world's Shawarma (Turkey)

8920 2018-03-19 01:50:31 Massive military & low oil price….
8921 2018-03-19 01:50:19 All I do is put sugar in the palm of my hand & pour baby oil into it.. then scrub whatever area & repeat

8923 2018-03-19 01:49:30 They buy their oil from the US.
8924 2018-03-19 01:49:19 But it isn't enough. Should have been done 15 years ago They were too slow and stupid. Just imagine Saudi Arabia wanting Yuan for their oil. The US will just walk away and leave the Saudi royal family to fend for themselves. The poor population will eat them alive.
8925 2018-03-19 01:49:19 Let's use yours "Specifically, Britain was interested in protecting the investments of Shell-BP in Nigerian oil. Furthermore, Britain was ALSO at the time desperate to keep Nigerian oil flowing in order to mitigate the impact of its domestic oil shortfalls" hence ARMS transfers

8949 2018-03-19 01:44:14 Ah the itch. It’s the WORST! Quickly patting it or slapping it helps and doesn’t do damage. I bought vitamin E oil from DG and apply it in thin layers and it helped me significantly!! Good luck! At least an itchy peely tattoo means it’s almostttt done

8959 2018-03-19 01:42:56 Miceller water is an easier step than oil cleansing for lazy days, because you just use it with a cotton pad and don't rinse it off

8962 2018-03-19 01:42:15 Yeah, miceller water is the same step as an oil based cleanser. :) a toner preps your skin for more products and makes them perform better.

8966 2018-03-19 01:41:50 And China during that time also used/managed the ratio between commodities to drive preferred economic outcomes...yet most westerners find the possibility of china using gold/oil ratio to drive preferred economic outcome (current account surplus mgmt) "inconceivable!"

8968 2018-03-19 01:41:30 If you're already doing an oil cleanse you shouldn't need it since it's an oil based cleanser. Imo of course. I'm no expert
8969 2018-03-19 01:41:24 It’s a typical reply to trolls who try to pass themselves off as educated critical thinkers but are merely mouthing vacuous rhetoric from tortuously-crafted scripts. Nice try, so hawk your snake oil quips elsewhere.  Not worth wasting my spittle on.

8971 2018-03-19 01:40:51 Advanced Oil Processing and cracking. Lots of solid fuel turned into rocket fuel. Basically if you get the correct ratio for cracking as early as you can, you shouldn't have extra light or heavy oil.

9028 2018-03-19 01:32:49 TY 4 your article Will. Like I said, I'm not for fracking, dapl, etp, tpp, keystone, etc. There's always going 2 b an issue 4 me, but, as i stated I'm glad 4 the extra prov as o/states do not have that clause. & yes its big $$ & there are cur 2 cand who have int in oil that
9029 2018-03-19 01:32:45 Conservatives in ND are wonderful and practical self-reliant folks.
Yet, the state owns a successful bank and grain elevators, and I believe moving ahead with an oil refinery.  All are very socialist but important to the successful operation of the State.

9031 2018-03-19 01:32:25 Billionaires can't get rich from teachers. Although that is changing. 
Typically it's oil and war.
So there we have it.
Totally unconscionable.
9032 2018-03-19 01:32:17 Sis. Tea tree and coconut oil on your yoni is the only way of life. Try it.
9033 2018-03-19 01:31:49 Didn't have any baby oil so I had to use olive oil to take off the adhesive from my bandages 
9034 2018-03-19 01:31:47 My dad changed my car’s oil, rotated my tires, washed my car, & filled up my tank I love him sm
9035 2018-03-19 01:31:21 Oh yes not too tight can’t do that I usually tell them leave a little bit of hair.. to make it grow back just add Jamaican oil on it watch how fast it grows

9041 2018-03-19 01:30:20 Face mask , coconut oil in my hair I just need to focus on me
9042 2018-03-19 01:30:20 isn't the US the biggest supplier of oil to the world now?  pipelines and all and tar sands and all?  perhaps that's why we're aiming to crush Venezuela to get their oil?
9043 2018-03-19 01:30:14 "I used to masturbate exclusively with motor oil...... yeah I was that guy"
9044 2018-03-19 01:30:01 No matter what string you pull it leads back to Russia, oil and sanctions.
9045 2018-03-19 01:30:01 Some oil behind your ears and pull until you hear aPOP. things will be brighter.
9046 2018-03-19 01:29:59 Lots of pimps out there. But he'll probably go the way of Sandra Fluke.
9047 2018-03-19 01:29:42 I hear that pays well.  Most folk don't pay that much attention.
9048 2018-03-19 01:29:36 If they were so rich then why his great grand father Ibn Saud was receiving stipend from their colonial Masters the British. Before oil they were dirt poor.
9049 2018-03-19 01:29:27 Tuna in olive oil 
9050 2018-03-19 01:29:19 I do things like rub my feet with a mix of black castor oil, peppermint oil, and coconut oil then put socks on. The type of sleep I get after this is dope. Plus, it feel pretty damn good
9051 2018-03-19 01:29:15 I’VE BEEN SAYIN COCONUT OIL IS TRASH it doesn’t even do anything for my hair
9052 2018-03-19 01:29:14 Coconut oil is good for the soul
9053 2018-03-19 01:28:40 Hmmmm... Did I forget to turn the oil taps off?
9054 2018-03-19 01:28:34 I may be late but what's going on here?? It looks malnutritioned. Not we nough oil to feed on huh?! 
9055 2018-03-19 01:28:31 If the Republicans were true conservatives, they would lead a national effort on the scale of WWII to move America to 100% renewable energy so that the terrorists would no longer profit from our oil consumption.
9056 2018-03-19 01:28:25 Thankful for peppermint oil
9057 2018-03-19 01:28:18 But... Oil...
9058 2018-03-19 01:28:10 I do agree with that but underestimating liberal idiots is a mistake.  F they're winning.
9059 2018-03-19 01:27:58 Acne is cause by bacteria, sebum (the oil your pores produce) blockages, and dead skin. Oils (not coconut oil, but say sunflower oil) attract oil, and oil soluble bacteria. 
Oils high in omega 3& 6 fatty acids help nourish the skin, so that it will stop sebum gland overproduction
9060 2018-03-19 01:27:54 헐..... OIL MONEY....
9061 2018-03-19 01:27:34 Just gotta continually hit the oil pen to keep ur brain balanced...

9063 2018-03-19 01:27:12 how patient? also vitamin e oil is soo thicc
9064 2018-03-19 01:27:04 I know it’s sounds so easy but the newly educated left wing kids are taught to hate without reason rather then to be objective,Which I find strange because educators are the cheapest people on the planet and they are payed by tax payers who work in the oil industry!!!!
9065 2018-03-19 01:26:59 Guess I’m burning the midnight oil 
9066 2018-03-19 01:26:53 my momma just rubbed my whole back down with peppermint, eucalyptus and coconut oil cause I hurt it at work...I love this woman

9068 2018-03-19 01:26:18 I just ate patchouli oil by accident.
9069 2018-03-19 01:25:51 Is there a chiropractor in your area? I had a pinched nerve in my neck and he worked miracles. He also sold magnesium oil (concentrated) that eased so much of my pain. You can order it on Amazon I think. Hope it gets better 
9070 2018-03-19 01:25:26 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
9071 2018-03-19 01:25:24 This girl mixed avacado, olive oil & coconut oil. I thought I was about to watch a avocado toast recipe, she was making hair conditioner

9073 2018-03-19 01:25:00 Libby tries to be nice and bake brownies for us, but she uses olive oil instead of vegetable oil  and let’s just say they taste awful 
9074 2018-03-19 01:24:59 I remember your tomatoes, so thought you should know.

1 Tbl spoon of baking soda,
2½ Tbl of vegetable oil,
1 tspoon of liquid soap
1 US gallon of water

can prevent, cure, in case you want to try
9075 2018-03-19 01:24:53 Just the first half.
9076 2018-03-19 01:24:49 Morning I’m so sleepy.

9079 2018-03-19 01:24:35 Am i the only one that feels like baby oil in the bedroom is just messy and impractical.
9080 2018-03-19 01:24:27 Tea tree oil on my face every night keeps my face relatively pretty clear of break outs
9081 2018-03-19 01:24:24 Haha.  You raised a teenager.  He's not all about being stoned and girls.  T be fair
9082 2018-03-19 01:24:16 If you find you a that knows how to change your tire or oil any of that. Be grateful because these niggas don’t know shit now a days
9083 2018-03-19 01:24:04 And people downstate know how often DNR holds coal and oil companies accountable to rules on the books. Almost never.
9084 2018-03-19 01:23:54 He always looks like he just oozes oil. I think he just produces it; doesn't even have to grease his hair down it just oozes out of his smarmy self!
9085 2018-03-19 01:23:32 Has anyone ever tried primrose oil ? 
9086 2018-03-19 01:23:03 Where are the parents and the School Board they elected?
9087 2018-03-19 01:22:38 Uh-oh... somebody's about to spill whale oil in the church again.  #Hearties @WCTH_TV @hallmarkchannel
9088 2018-03-19 01:22:31 @BabestationTV don’t get me wrong I’m about to get sooooo naughty with @jesswestxxx but surely there’s @xAliceGoodwinx in the house there obvs baby oil in the house #Alice+Oil TONIGHT
9089 2018-03-19 01:22:29 Ill see if i can find a bulk supplier of olive oil then we can get the ball rolling
9090 2018-03-19 01:22:27 طاح اللي في راسك ولبستي 
9091 2018-03-19 01:22:18 I scrape said oil to my cheeks and nose just like a real makeup ho!
9092 2018-03-19 01:22:15 Who are you?  Drumming up respect points?  McKinnon pretty clear. You will have some who love the Oil and want McDavid to win everything regardless. They are called “fans”. It’s not. Bad thing Gregory. If that is your real name...
9093 2018-03-19 01:22:07 So gross. What parent would let that happen.
9094 2018-03-19 01:21:59 What business?
Buying wepans to kill Muslim innocents and selling the oil to US?
Bouth r Shemless leaders. #MuslimsForPeace @islaminind @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi
9095 2018-03-19 01:21:56 And gotta be right back up in the morning for an oil change 
9096 2018-03-19 01:21:45 Hot chicken broth with red child oil. Fix you right up.
9097 2018-03-19 01:21:23 I am amazed that TRump still has supporters. I’m no political genius but I knew from the start he was a snake oil salesman. I never knew I could despise someone as much as I do tRump. He is a psychopathic liar and narcissist. I can hardly wait until Mueller does him in. #HangHim
9098 2018-03-19 01:21:21 Soy boy.
9099 2018-03-19 01:21:19 My dog is obsessed with coconut oil 
9100 2018-03-19 01:21:09 I did a full body scrup with sugar & honey and olive oil. And my skin is breathing so loud now.
9101 2018-03-19 01:20:55 This hurts more than a heartbreak. Hot oil when frying things arent a joke
9102 2018-03-19 01:20:54 Hope they will vote yes next Indy, knowing how the 'no' side lied, cheated and treated people like dirt, all to achieve the tory aim of keeping Scottish oil to build their own 'reserves' in their tax havens!
9103 2018-03-19 01:20:27 Never have trusted or liked Ryan. He has always struck me as a sleezy snake oil salesman.
9104 2018-03-19 01:20:27 He’s a liberal. He has no problem accepting handouts for no reason
9105 2018-03-19 01:20:26 Just applied castor oil on my eyebrows. Let’s hope this works cause I need them to grow lol
9106 2018-03-19 01:20:20 I agree, but substance abuse is a reality for a lot of people which leads them to have these psychotic episodes. I can totally understand where there may be benefits (hemp oil etc) but we can’t ignore that there are also serious adverse effects affecting people mentally
9107 2018-03-19 01:20:02 Hey aren’t you supposed to be eloping or something?
9108 2018-03-19 01:19:58 He's actually a smart kid.  I think he hopes for it.  Dreams of it.  And I'll ultimately be disappointed by them.
9109 2018-03-19 01:19:14 now that spring break is over i think the real question is whether coconut oil or a bag of rice will work better to revive my grades
9110 2018-03-19 01:18:56 (#^-^)ﾒﾗﾒﾗ……ﾒﾗﾒﾗ…
9111 2018-03-19 01:18:56 What have you the right to blow through tax payers money like it was your inheritance? We are so disappointed that you burn through our taxpayer dollars, and that you can be bought and paid for by oil and mineral companies.
9112 2018-03-19 01:18:47 @CTVVancouver Watched the segment on gas prices. Certainly the cost is high but the ‘Gas Buddy’ is offline. Putting the pipeline through brings bitumin to the port not to a refinery. Look out the window, how many refineries do you see? Building the pipeline sends oil overseas.

9121 2018-03-19 01:16:43 You have nothing on black people. It is our culture your useless kids want to emulate. What is Saudi Arabia known for if not terrorism? What have you done with all that oil an gold. Why are there still poor people in your rich kingdom?

Purée cilantro, jalapeños, garlic, oil, lime juice, and salt in a blender until combined. Add mayonnaise and purée until well blended. Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and chill until ready to use.
9123 2018-03-19 01:16:27 Shame on big oil money!
9124 2018-03-19 01:16:27 i wish i could make it but i’m going to smoke a blunt lather myself in lavender oil and take a boiling hot shower instead
9125 2018-03-19 01:16:23 news flash - the names may be changed but your party is as deep in someone else's pockets as any of the republicans. the kochs, soros, the nra, big pharma & oil...there is just 1 politician who has been fighting to get money OUT OF POLITICS. i'll give u a hint - it ain't shillary
9126 2018-03-19 01:16:13 And how many people have you killed with your snake oil claims? Ur trying to sell a glorified fidget spinner, and here u r arguing with a doc who is actually informed on the peer reviewed literature, I think I’m gonna be .
9127 2018-03-19 01:16:08 And you don’t even question their hypocrisy? Washington’s oil infrastructure is huge compared to ours...yet these goofs protest ours

9129 2018-03-19 01:16:01 obviously not, but he had status/power and general social rank amongst cote d'azur socialites. that certainly put him over emirati chodes with oil dollaz who h ave to resort to raw sponsorship game.
9130 2018-03-19 01:15:56 What amazes me is that Hubble pictures often look like oil portraits. This one is surreal. What a gift Hubble has been to all of humanity.
9131 2018-03-19 01:15:53 There’s an oil crisis you damn peens
9132 2018-03-19 01:15:46 Kindly remove all the oily things up there in the stadium, Americans fucking love oil, might invade the stadium.
9133 2018-03-19 01:15:45 My dearest trump. I can not stop thinking of our time spent together at my lake house in the old country. Those long cold nights where you applied the oil to my pecks was unforgettable. The way your tiny hands worked their magic..
9134 2018-03-19 01:15:34 I definitely accidentally made them in Australia when we were low on sweet potato and I needed to pretend we weren't for something we were hosting. then my happy accident begat the best thing ever. garlic salt, olive oil, and cayenne pepper on carrot "fries"

9142 2018-03-19 01:13:44 Cast iron skillet with olive oil and Kerry Gold butter and a little thyme near the end. Be sure to dry the steaks after they’ve been in the bag. Badge with the butter then make a pan sauce. Good stuff!
9143 2018-03-19 01:13:33 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9144 2018-03-19 01:13:29 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
9145 2018-03-19 01:12:39 Throw a little bacon or panchetta in with them, toss ‘em with that and some oil and shallots and roast. My favorite is when the outside leaves fall off and get super crispy.
9146 2018-03-19 01:12:31 it won’t help immediately, but castor oil is really good for hair growth! i put it on every night and my lashes and eyebrows grew a lot
9147 2018-03-19 01:12:14 Asia is selling off. News related? #markets #trading #forex #USDJPY is down. #oil may follow too.
9148 2018-03-19 01:12:07 How can Europe and other politicians and countries be so ignorant. Islam and western culture just cannot mix. It’s like oil and water....  with Trump leading America is this western worlds only hope. No hatred meant just fact... I’ve experienced myself spoken with knowledge

All the oil things at the store smelled the same to me but now that I put it in the diffuser it smells like super strong grandpa cologne 
9153 2018-03-19 01:11:40 ALSO if ur not getting hypertrophic scarring cut the tea tree oil altogether. you should really only be using antimicrobial soap and rinsing it and the salt spray as an extra cleanser

9158 2018-03-19 01:10:39 If we can agree that too many parties want to dump the dollar as WRC, we can also agree there is not another fiat standard to replace it. So the parties must agree on a commodity standard, to restore trade as an exchange of real for real. They default to oil and gold.

9162 2018-03-19 01:10:10 I suspect Putin’s motives were 1) keep military-invasion-friendly HRC out of the WH, and 2) assure djt loan repayments & oil & $ laundering pipeline. Cannot imagine that he wants U.S. to initiate more, worse wars w/Iran or NK.

9168 2018-03-19 01:09:15 It’s not ridiculous to say that in a league where more than half the teams make the playoffs you need to be at least in contention to win MVP. Oil been done since November.
9169 2018-03-19 01:09:08 Oh, God.  Modern day snake oil salesmen.
9170 2018-03-19 01:09:08 That works too, but I use my cast-iron frying pan. No need to heat up the whole oven.  Just turn on the heat, put in the pizza slice (no oil needed), crisp the crust then cover for a minute to re-soften the cheese. Quick, easy and energy efficient!
9171 2018-03-19 01:09:06 What is new. Up to 300 a day thanks to lax regulation of oil and gas industry. Now that prices are going up it will get worse.
9172 2018-03-19 01:08:59 So why don't the Russians sell the oil in roubles to the Chinese? The Russians are making the same mistake as the Chinese. The energy producer should be calling the shots and not the consumer.
9173 2018-03-19 01:08:56 The article got the target demographic right: People with giant yachts, and people with oil wells.
9174 2018-03-19 01:08:54 optimizing the game for the mac books we are using is like trying to get a car to run efficiently on olive oil
9175 2018-03-19 01:08:54 Need a natural and safe way to calm down after these #MarchMadness games? Lavender essential oil gets the job done! (While you are ordering might as well get a few organic beauty products as well ) #organic #clean #beauty #UMBC?
9176 2018-03-19 01:08:27 You could put sticky notes starting at the top of Shaq's head and run it down the length of his body, and it still wouldn't equal the to do list from the wife on our first full day back tomorrow. Oil changes and inspections for both cars, taxes, groceries, calls, etc. Cringing.
9177 2018-03-19 01:08:22 In need of some essential oil I need to bless my personal spaces
9178 2018-03-19 01:08:06 Go be gay in Russia and get back to us. California has a bigger economy than Russia. What does Russia produce?  Vodka, fur coats, oil gas reserves?  Go back girlfriend.
9179 2018-03-19 01:07:53 Of course.  And if it is ever to serve as a reserve asset in any capacity, it must be made much "bigger" than it is today.  Annual phys gold production is roughly 1/10  annual oil production alone & ~1/10 China's annual commodity import bill...

9182 2018-03-19 01:06:41 You could say “we need the expansion because oil is important and good for our economy” and make an argument for that, or maybe an argument that pipelines are safer, I don’t know. But that previous argument is a bad one.
9183 2018-03-19 01:06:29 Oven at 400F, sprouts cut in half & tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, roasted for about 30-40min on a flat pan. That's about it. :)

9200 2018-03-19 01:03:59 You’re right. That is why Russia sells its oil to the Chinese in local currency and the Petroyuan is being floated. China is not and probably never will be self-sufficient in energy. They need to buy, but not with the dollar.
9201 2018-03-19 01:03:21 Bad people though. Look at Pepsi and palm oil.
9202 2018-03-19 01:03:07 you know when it smells too much like oil and you suddenly can't breathe? i feel like i'm dying

9211 2018-03-19 01:00:44 Denmark isn't nearly as oil rich as Norway. And both are countries with populations have the size of London. I travel to both places a lot every year, and I don't know anybody in either country who thinks they'd be better off outside the EU. But obviously I don't know them all!
9212 2018-03-19 01:00:41 the economy improved from breaking up Standard Oil and ma Bell, along with the Bell Labs consent decree, common carrier regulations and so on. There's really no reason not to break up Google

Or he said: NO! I LIKE LOOKING STUPID!
9219 2018-03-19 01:00:13 I can see three arguments in favour of Moar Drillz! 1. Not all fossil fuels are equally bad - gas would be a good step away from Oil in the short term...2. FU give us money, rather than those foreigners (for our oil and not theirs). 3. Burn it all - Climate Change is made up. 1/2
9220 2018-03-19 01:00:04 What are you talking about? Manifest destiny didn’t start until the US started to expand westward, the US didn’t even exist when the Mystic Massacre occurred. And I’m fairly sure oil isn’t the blood of Satan, it’s jut oil.
9221 2018-03-19 01:00:04 I recently watched the first 2 part episode of "Dynasty," the 1980's Texas oil soap opera. The thing is, you can see how Trump was influenced by it, in behavior and pattern. Unethical and sordid actors, and lots of gold and possessing of, and lying to, women.

9232 2018-03-19 00:58:43 I'm definitely that customer at the supermarket with her list of what's on sale & if the vegetable oil says $2.98 on the flyer why your screen show $3.99?!

9252 2018-03-19 00:54:57 There is no science behind "ex-gay therapy". It's religious quackery pretending to be psychology. There are no standards of care in your snake oil.

I've seen it firsthand, particularly corporate friends in oil and gas and financial industries, losing their common sense humanity
9265 2018-03-19 00:52:16 just you drink tis here oil of the snake

9306 2018-03-19 00:46:00 ざっくり計算したけどSSR率4%切ってました…。リミキャラとはいわずとも金月くらいもう少しほしかった…
9307 2018-03-19 00:45:55 And I bet you’re one of the causniks that protested urainium too! Go protest India’s and China’s coal fired plants. The carbon tax is hugely disproportional to our contribution and oil is cleaner than coal!
9308 2018-03-19 00:45:45 So we just import the oil instead? brilliant...its come on ships..tankers...that burn even more oil...absolute genius...NOT #dontendoil
9309 2018-03-19 00:45:40 I love my aches and pains night time oil.

9315 2018-03-19 00:44:57 They invented ISIS as a way of stealing Syrian oil. Trading in below market oil.
9316 2018-03-19 00:44:51 Not oil, ghee.
9317 2018-03-19 00:44:17 Selling snake oil.
9318 2018-03-19 00:44:05 I'm not fully invested into my bacon making process until I get spit on with oil. Now this shit is personal.
9319 2018-03-19 00:43:54 I suggest you walk the walk and stop using oil products. Your phone in your hand uses more than a barrel of oil to produce. 

Look at the research rather than listen to Greenpeace and Tides: bitumen floats and can be recovered if there is a spill.
9320 2018-03-19 00:43:53 I went as part of a team to look at the ones in Lubec - must be 25 years ago now They wreaked of oil and smoke - any spark would set them alight Really interesting - local group was trying to get them recognized on historic register One of them just washed out to sea
9321 2018-03-19 00:43:49 i feel like people who have hair that the oil slides down while brushing it can do this, but as a curly lady, the ends of my hair never see natural oils, and if i brush it too much, it fucks up my curl pattern...you'll save so much $! and its so good for the environment too 
9322 2018-03-19 00:43:45 so brain-ambushed and totally drained by being around a crew of people for just one day that i'm pushing my forthcoming sobriety challenge back a night and cuddling up with pizza, scandal, an essential oil diffuser, duck, and a nice last malbec that i may not use a glass with

9327 2018-03-19 00:43:12 Hi @elonmusk how does @TheBoringCompany plan to avoid the 10,000 oil wells scattered randomly throughout the LA area?
9328 2018-03-19 00:43:04 The Irving refineries in New Brunswick do not have the capacity to refine dilbit.  It requires a different process and is too costly for them to justify.  That is why they continue to import crude oil from Saudi Arabia.

9331 2018-03-19 00:42:34 Anakin Skywalker hearing the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise totally illustrates how tide pods turned into a snake oil orgy
9332 2018-03-19 00:42:33 I asked Allergy Girl if she wanted that  (olive oil/no cheese) & she said no, she’d rather have spaghetti. So I made the eggplant pizza for myself but made her try a piece.
9333 2018-03-19 00:42:24 Creooo q no vamoss a llegar  ni a la oil
9334 2018-03-19 00:42:23 Good moisturizer, hair conditioning oil, etc. Been using it for centuries in South Asia. Now y'all have finally caught on.
9335 2018-03-19 00:42:20 Maybe they were just thinking of their mortgage, paying for swimming lessons for their kids and getting their oil changed. These are people, people.
9336 2018-03-19 00:42:18 The US has started wars for oil and such things have occurred so I think it’s just a mirror of our society
9337 2018-03-19 00:42:15 100連もきて御理解までしたけど期待値まで全然届かなかったよ！
9338 2018-03-19 00:42:09 you’ll have to bleach more than once to get it out so if you haven’t already put coconut oil on your hair before you bleach, it will lighten the same amount but will protect from some of the damage
9339 2018-03-19 00:42:06 Sooo is "coconut oil as a moisturizer" the new "pineapple on pizza" debate?

9341 2018-03-19 00:41:54 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9342 2018-03-19 00:41:54 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9351 2018-03-19 00:40:35 Ok buddy. You keep working for that coal plant. Hopefully the coal industry business model is better than the whale oil industry was. Or the typewriter. Or fax machine etc.
9352 2018-03-19 00:40:28 I made ramen I dropped it in the sink but I added sesame oil and soy sauce and mmmm can’t taste the grime fellas

9355 2018-03-19 00:40:18 It's not oil, it's dilbit. A spill would see asphalt which would sink and be unrecoverable and gassing off of toxic solvents which is a fire hazard but also possibly  lethal if it reaches a community
9356 2018-03-19 00:40:16 I know @SashaRJones streams oil painting and other traditional stuffs. He might have some suggestions.
9357 2018-03-19 00:40:15 Thst family were small time thugs during several centuries of Ottoman rule. Prince stop distorting history. You're rich because you usurp a large amount of that wealth emanating from oil and other national resources. Wealth that actually belongs to the people.
9358 2018-03-19 00:40:15 They gave credit to the guys who said they invented everything. Pretty sure that works every time. They gave credit to the Brits for oil production (Iroquois), those agricultural practises (N&S America), NA democracy (also Iroquois), & so on...

9361 2018-03-19 00:40:07 I wish you build some new sets guys so we can start unleash the #OldSkool A-Bomb with #Oil and getting #XRated with her
9362 2018-03-19 00:40:00 Only take out of a hard case to play, if the woods need it use a humidifier, I use the dunlop body conditioner every few sessions to protect the finish, and lemon oil the fretboard a couple times a year. Need to try @CrimsonGuitars fretboard juice sometime, s'posed to be better.

9367 2018-03-19 00:39:21 The idea that since I use oil I should unquestioningly accept expanded oil infrastructure is so maddening.  I mean what, like even if satan himself, with horns and everything was openly murdering puppies to get oil, I'm a hypocrite if I criticize that and drive a car to work?
9368 2018-03-19 00:38:58 Social license began with a decent premise but it became a "Look!  Squirrel!" initiative to drive heavy oil producers and supporters down a dead end road where there is no license.
9369 2018-03-19 00:38:58 Me acne skin... i pakai cream faoundation, cleanser yg mane sesuai?? Oil or milk?? Skrg i pakai clenser sebamed je...

9373 2018-03-19 00:38:25 I wish Saudi Arabia well, and respect their efforts on political & economic reform. But I don’t see why we need a Saudi-centric foreign policy when America is an oil exporter.
9374 2018-03-19 00:38:18 Pro tip always make sure your Korean chili oil is FULLY SEALED before putting it in the fridge. On its side.

9379 2018-03-19 00:37:45 Telling someone to roast anything in olive oil at a temp above 405 degrees like your smoke detector isn't going to freak out is straight up disrespectful.
9380 2018-03-19 00:37:43 Yep—requires little or no oil. I’ve made silver dollar hashbrowns and egg rolls so far and neither required any oil and came out SUPER crispy. No mess, no gross oil to get rid of, and way healthier and faster.
9381 2018-03-19 00:37:33 if anything is wrong there are 3 helpful healers; water, weed, or coconut oil. if none of those work well then you're fucked.

9385 2018-03-19 00:37:15 Sadly it is the resource rich north, with oil, gas, forestry and mining paying for the ability of the urban 'green' to cross over the Fraser in their resource-consuming SUV's to protest those who work in the industry.  Some hypocrisy going on here.
9386 2018-03-19 00:37:06 Towns and counties decide they are "dry", plant count ordinances are implemented and politicians are clueless. 12 plants for someone making oil for a child w seizures or a cancer patient is NOTHING.

Somewhere inside that gov’t there has to be a small group of brave souls to stand up to the tyranny of oil.

9432 2018-03-19 00:27:26 They had to do this, because of their failed oil war with us.  Trump should quietly expand the number of drilling premits to further tighten the screws against OPEC.

9435 2018-03-19 00:27:00 ABSOLUTE BALONEY! My d-i-law did coring testing for new fields. She's geologist/geoscientist. She said in 2014 there are MANY DECADES of oil left & it is inexpensively recoverable!! New recovery procedures came in then making it cheap & easy to recover! You're talking HOGWASH.
9436 2018-03-19 00:26:38 So what happens when we are the last untapped oil field in the world? I’ll tell you that we’ll suffer just like any other country that has withheld oil from the biggest users, so we may as well get rid of it now. & use it in our own economy to ease petrol price pressure.
9437 2018-03-19 00:26:14 Million dollar question.  CIA assisted neo nazi types in Ukrainian coup. Why? Oil fields discovered?  Bidens son now VP for energy company in Ukraine.

9439 2018-03-19 00:26:01 And IF fomc is a catalyst for the move higher then oil is likely headed back to lower support.

However I don't make it a habit to try and make bearish bets against oil.  I've been dead on right and yet still wrong

9444 2018-03-19 00:25:22 1/4 cup Olive oil, 1/2 tsp each dried oregano and basil, 1/2 tsp sugar, and salt and pepper. They’re great for pasta, pizza, sandwiches or eating straight up.
9445 2018-03-19 00:25:17 Until oil prices tank again. Ask North Dakota how well that works out.
9446 2018-03-19 00:25:05 You couldn’t reach the sun flower oil in the top shelve, pipe down further
9447 2018-03-19 00:24:52 I'm no oil painting but a troll is pushing it (don't believe the avatar). Far right? Don't think so, never have been, nor will I ever be. Critical of Islam? Most definitely. Sick to the back teeth of the EU and it's immigration policy? I'll leave you to work it out Edith.
9448 2018-03-19 00:24:15 yeah pretty sure it isn’t a partisan issue . Jill Stein has about a million in oil shares, and Obama was in office when they were laying pipeline on the ranch.  See all parties love oil,
9449 2018-03-19 00:24:15 The only difference btwn me washing my hair & spraying a leave in & oil vs adding strengthening milk & a cream/gel then oil, is those products make my hair stiff (longer lasting style) & clump my curls more. My curls are no looser or tighter.
9450 2018-03-19 00:24:14 Tonight I made rice noodles, steamed baby brocolli, steamed tofu, dressed in soy sauce and sesame oil. 

I'm not bragging. It was disgusting.
9451 2018-03-19 00:24:08 Squalane and Marula oil are also great for the skin 
9452 2018-03-19 00:24:02 Why isn't Janet chaining herself to a Saudi tanker coming into Canadian ports oh right she needs gas for the SUV to see the grand kids. These protestors are so very selective of their oil outrage.
9453 2018-03-19 00:24:00 How could you Pete. Nutella contains palm oil. You've just made an orangutan homeless. Bon appetit.
9454 2018-03-19 00:23:49 Get on the cbd oil m8. My mum Is stage 4 and of that chemo shit
9455 2018-03-19 00:23:43 There's a reason for that. The Military Industrial Complex are out to make money. BAE's share price would plummet if Corbyn was in charge. The oil and gas sector would also take a massive hit. The banks would lose out too. It'd be very bad for business but good for the world.
9456 2018-03-19 00:23:31 I just brushed Cleo’s teeth with coconut oil and she was living for it
9457 2018-03-19 00:23:27 Oh that's fine you didn't mention all those other bits of confirmation. Have sales of German motors fallen in US or is it The US made cars which are dropping oil on people's drives?
9458 2018-03-19 00:23:26 Tea tree oil be a savior
9459 2018-03-19 00:23:26 this is a relatable oil painting feels twitter
9460 2018-03-19 00:23:25 Nah I stop but get you some Jamaican castor oil
9461 2018-03-19 00:23:15 Was it a lot of oil?
9462 2018-03-19 00:23:14 ok look it has been a whole-ass two (2) days since I bought and have been using argan oil in my skincare routine and I'm already v happy with what it's doing

9464 2018-03-19 00:23:04 If you thought we was wild at the beach just wait till Oil Spill 
9465 2018-03-19 00:22:46 not sure the snark is totally necessary here but what i’m saying is that on top of all the valid concerns over data and privacy...we don’t actually know if the thing we are freaked out about is snake oil or truly effective
9466 2018-03-19 00:22:29 75% of Saudi Arabia’s citizens are under 30. Because oil is no longer a predictable revenue source, the cradle-to-grave services--including healthcare and education--guaranteed to everyone are imperiled.
9467 2018-03-19 00:22:25 Oil on canvas Jacques-Louis David.
9468 2018-03-19 00:22:22 Going add my voice to those arguing that Cambridge Analytica is simultaneously (1) sleazy (both in terms of the politics it supports and its use of data) and (2) peddling snake oil. (1/x)
9469 2018-03-19 00:22:14 Ran outta heating oil, not getting any delivered till tomorrow morning... its gon be a cold af night
9470 2018-03-19 00:22:10 It worries me how much water it takes to extract oil from shale rock, and the surge of earthquakes in those areas. I do hope care is taken around Yellowstone.
9471 2018-03-19 00:22:03 A radio appeared in the bathroom the year Mariah hit the scene. The year I discovered through hearsay that baby oil was not only for babies. Draw your own conclusions, but I promise you that this tweet is 110% about one of my earliest masturbation memories.
9472 2018-03-19 00:21:45 Convention of States needed NOW! 
Big Government spreading like cancer while some are in denial, and many believin the snake oil salesman ... Yes Aunt Bea, Ladies you been snookered...
9473 2018-03-19 00:21:40 If Catalonians were armed, this could have turned into a huge bloodbath.  That is preferable in your eyes?
9474 2018-03-19 00:21:33 I say we ought to refine it here in Canada (just like we shouldn't ship raw logs) and use our oil to achieve at least a modicum of energy independence while transitioning to renewables and retraining portions of the workforce into new technology.

9476 2018-03-19 00:21:11 Sir, we are the public of Birpara Chowpati requesting intervention for shifting of Guwahati Siliguri Pipe Line of OIL INDIA LTD. besides NSPL from Birpara Chowpati to save shops and houses of 500 families for widening of "ASIAN HIGHWAY 48"@dpradhanbjp
9477 2018-03-19 00:21:10 Haha - find a photo of environmental destruction (oil spills, endangered animals, plastic in oceans, etc.) and print it out for an assignment. If you can’t print, you can email it to me!
9478 2018-03-19 00:20:56 You can get half an oil change in a Gallardo for $200! ;)
9479 2018-03-19 00:20:55 Cod liver oil 
9480 2018-03-19 00:20:52 Maybe for now, but it won’t last. Saudi Arabia is too because of the gushing oil revenues, but what happens when that dries up? Capitalism that gives everyone a chance to prosper is better than a handout. People want to come to the US for a chance to prosper, not a handout.

9483 2018-03-19 00:20:08 The internet better not have been lying when it said putting castor oil on your eyelashes helps them grow because I sure as hell am not going to sleep with greasy eyelashes right now for the fun of it

9487 2018-03-19 00:19:43 The only reason an extraction tax isn't already imposed on oil companies in  PA is because Republicans in Harrisburg are protecting their oil buddies and their own pockets. Govnr. Wolf ran on it before and he should  do it again.
9488 2018-03-19 00:19:36 That's a little overkill for a fire. I recommend a pot of boiling oil instead.
9489 2018-03-19 00:19:32 Trump is the modern day version of the snake oil salesman. People would pay for this miracle oil that was nothing more than sugar and water....Some folks swore it worked.....till the day they died..... 
9490 2018-03-19 00:19:31 Nickel plated oil field sucker pipe. It looks really cool, but is a disaster to try and weld
9491 2018-03-19 00:19:28 Also, it isn't personal. Thousands of people were forced to watch their loved ones suffer, unsure how to pay for their dying family member's care while the GOP used that as a lever to get oil concessions.
9492 2018-03-19 00:19:22 Rose hip seed oil is my favorite
9493 2018-03-19 00:19:14 All hypocrites- the lot of you. Everything you own has plastic in it- it’s all petroleum based. You have all been bought out by anti Canadian oil groups out of US! While US has refineries in the west coast already! You are selfish BC people who live carbon intensive lifestyles.

9495 2018-03-19 00:18:53 DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - this stuff melts makeup, then emulsifies to a soap when u add water. Combine w/their 2nd step soap- skin feels AMAZING. Have never found another cleanser that left my skin feeling so good.
9496 2018-03-19 00:18:50 A CISO/CPO working in a company that sells users' data is like a renewable energy executive working in an oil company. :P @alexstamos

9498 2018-03-19 00:18:36 Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.
9499 2018-03-19 00:18:29 So good. They are so, so good. In the summer I will saute sardines in olive oil and red pepper flake then eat them over rice, but I’m not above eating them from the can with a pack of crackers.
9500 2018-03-19 00:18:20 I'm fine
9501 2018-03-19 00:18:12 "I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:" ~Psalms 89:20 #Bible
9502 2018-03-19 00:18:00 I have a problem. But, then, that's my problem. Good morning. Oil your own machine. 
9503 2018-03-19 00:17:48 This relationship show being portrayed as An NBA championship, I have NO vested interest in! Nor do the mindless mental triggers matter anymore! Stop slamming your doors before even WD40 oil much less Gods oil work to fix them
9504 2018-03-19 00:17:45 "I'm like oil. Everyone wants some. Everyone needs some. But not everyone can get some. It's all about supply and demand. I'm expensive bitch" - @Mhyykol . We should all have this level if self love and confidence

9509 2018-03-19 00:16:44 I need to get an oil change and don't feel like it
9510 2018-03-19 00:16:27 We(USA) should have become closer to Russia after the Social Democrats lost control in early ‘90’s. They had oil, we had food. We chose Saudi Arabia & radical Islam over people wanting a chance to become better. They aren’t evil, we are corrupt. - DC #TruthHurts
9511 2018-03-19 00:16:26 Saudi intentionally dropped the price of oil so it would drive the fracking industry out of the market. If it costs more to get out it's not worth it.
9512 2018-03-19 00:16:23 Gurll use tea tree oil before going to sleep on that pimple. The next day its gone. I swear by it :)
9513 2018-03-19 00:16:09 Let me know if you find my Aussie oil skin  jacket I left in one of their compartments a few years ago. They never returned it.
9514 2018-03-19 00:16:06 Also interesting to look at the early oil places (Ohio, etc) and the reasons they hit their sigmoidal curves
9515 2018-03-19 00:15:52 Bush; do you ever age or do you have an oil painting in the attic?
9516 2018-03-19 00:15:52 24 was a right wing fantasy too yet their bad guys included oil tycoons, victims of US imperialism, PMCs, *a sitting US president*

9522 2018-03-19 00:14:59 @dominos A bit sad to see you supporting the pipeline protestors. A group of jobless kids who have no idea how the oil industry impacts all of Canada. Keep supplying them free pizza. I’ll pay for mine elsewhere.
9523 2018-03-19 00:14:49 あっ そういう事でしたか。

9525 2018-03-19 00:14:39 I do like tinned sardines in olive oil, but I usually like it on saltines, or harder crackers + cheese, or on crispy baguettes as a sorta bruschetta almost
9526 2018-03-19 00:14:33 OiLさん、おはようございます
9527 2018-03-19 00:14:21 Limited government is dangerous now. Corporations have too much money and power. Corporations, banks, big oil, for-profit hospitals... they serve their stock holders. Government serves the people, all the people.  We are witnessing the erosion of American constitutional values.
9528 2018-03-19 00:14:13 Also, though N. Dakota did experience a new oil boom, one they hoped would last as long as the  one in the 80s, the boom slowed as soon as the Saudis increased production, which put up to 1/3 of drillers out of biz by June of last year. Commodities are tough.
9529 2018-03-19 00:14:10 Interesting. Why not Texas? Lots of defense industry, lots of oil prospecting.

One reason I like the gold rush theory is that Seattle also had a gold rush boom. (Klondike gold rush.)
9530 2018-03-19 00:13:54 Beli lagi satu pencuci muka jenis foam punya... boleh buat double cleansing utk biore oil cleansing tu.

2. Any facial wash jenis foam#

Done.
9531 2018-03-19 00:13:48 .. increased oil production massively, became an oil exporter & is now the biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. #KMPipeline helps US & reduces Canadian ability to fetch higher prices in Asia or the US. As such, all US support of strikes here ought to be illegal.
9532 2018-03-19 00:13:22 No click is there a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for the best insult when you think yall mind if you're
9533 2018-03-19 00:13:21 A completely serious question: what are your feelings on tinned sardines or anchovies or other fish? I'm already a big fan of tuna in olive oil, but I wanna take advantage of more nutritious, sustainable fish.
9534 2018-03-19 00:13:06 You can't expect Apple to suddenly start building cars.
The company is not equipped to do so.

You also can't expect oil companies that have been told to have minimal environmental impact to ALSO come up with capital for alternative energy projects.
9535 2018-03-19 00:13:05 i’m allergic to peppermint oil & rubbed it into my eyes. i am my own demise ffs.
9536 2018-03-19 00:12:54 Were you there to lobby for gas & oil interests? Sell off our lands to the highest bidder? Did you get there by plane needed for fighting wildfires somewhere else? Making deals with ultra-rich buddies? 
I'm sure it was just to "hike".
9537 2018-03-19 00:12:53 @La_Cornisa_ por favor oreguntele al sr.presidente... sobre Oil. Si va a seguir como tal..

9543 2018-03-19 00:12:11 I go to the beauty supply at least twice a week and still forget hair oil.
9544 2018-03-19 00:12:05 The oil companies have huge investments in petro extraction, and they've directed their capital to extracting it with minimal environmental disturbance, minimal process-related pollutants, and maximum post extraction reclaimation.
9545 2018-03-19 00:12:01 roast it in coconut oil, rosemary, salt and pepper and lather with dairy free yogurt and pom seeds! SO GOOD!

Find something better to sell the world or the world will find something better and put you out of business.
9567 2018-03-19 00:09:32 現環境だとそれでも普通くらいなのがヤバい
9568 2018-03-19 00:09:03 I would much rather be drilling for oil in our own backyard with our own rules and regulations than buying it from a corrupt govt in the Middle East. Oil is here for a long time. Let’s work out a way to burn it cleaner instead
9569 2018-03-19 00:08:59 I love that so many brands on the market are now eliminating parabens, mineral oil, sulfates, and other harmful ingredients from products, but still giving me a great price point to splurge.  #winning #savingmoney #HealthyLife

9579 2018-03-19 00:07:54 Oil and gas companies not only should pay their fair share, but also they should not be allowed to pass the tax costs onto the consumers.

9586 2018-03-19 00:06:58 Greetings of Gudi Padva, Chaitra Navratri, Navreh, Ugadi & Cheti Chand Pray Devi save us from supporters of Loan and Tax grabbers, Mafias of Mines, Daal, Network, Edible Oil, Oil and Gas, School and Medical education,  Panama, Sahara, Pardise and HSBC named Cronies,..?
9587 2018-03-19 00:06:53 Some say when he masturbates he ejaculates crude oil.
9588 2018-03-19 00:06:45 Just started watching @LaBeautyologist YouTube channel and she is so informative about everything skin. Love it! Shoutout to @richiebrave for tweeting one of her links. I definitely did the coconut oil on my face one too LOOOOL! Didn't break out but I hear you! :D
9589 2018-03-19 00:06:39 And the oil companies are putting massive investments into environmental reclaimation projects, lowering extraction and refining emissions, and yet the people that work for them get slapped wit carbon taxes.
9590 2018-03-19 00:06:29 The West could take him on so easily if they chose to. We lack the political will. Tell Russia: Turn to democracy or no thanks to deals involving oil and gas, etc.
9591 2018-03-19 00:06:22 So they tariff us, require technical transfer to do business in China and outright steal IP, and we just take it? 
9592 2018-03-19 00:06:08 Oil and water
9593 2018-03-19 00:06:04 Fracking is a dangerous diversion from the need to make the immediate switch to renewables. The already-developed oil and gas reserves will push us beyond Paris targets. No new fossil fuel projects should be approved--fracking included.
9594 2018-03-19 00:06:04 If u wanna wash my hair or oil my scalp... in the words of dmx, "get at me dog"

9599 2018-03-19 00:05:36 And now he wants the death penalty for drug dealers? He’s only for the constitution when it’s convenient.  He had a “listening” session with Parkland residents and then what? Nothing. He’s a snake oil salesmen and far too many have bought from him. Not me!
9600 2018-03-19 00:05:33 Soooo, am I the only one who have to argue with a mechanic about what else needs fixing on my car when I just go for an oil change? “you need to change the air filter” nigga, it was working just fine otw here. give me my keys. 
9601 2018-03-19 00:05:21 フライゴン…w
9602 2018-03-19 00:05:20 Forse perché gli USA e l'Arabia Saudita abbassano artificialmente ll prezzo del petrolio con lo scopo di mettere in difficoltà i paesi emergenti?Io lavoro nel settore e certe cose le so.Lavoro per gli americani,i francesi ed i tedeschi nel settore oil&gas quindi so di cosa parlo.
9603 2018-03-19 00:05:06 If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. Mother Teresa
9604 2018-03-19 00:05:05 I mixed my foundation with maracuja oil yesterday & i cant believe i ddnt try it sooner, it was FLAWLESS
9605 2018-03-19 00:05:03 Akhir mg lalu Dow naik +72,85 (+0,29%) di 24.946. S&P500 naik +4,68 (+0,17%) di 2.752. Oil di 62,25 dan Emas di 1313
9606 2018-03-19 00:04:44 Does not cure an oil fire
9607 2018-03-19 00:04:42 Anyway I don't give up and I am conducting my HCA project for patients, for family and for caregivers. Because our HCA project shows the remarkable recovery from cognitive decline of patients. Do you know the coconuts oil treatment? It will be effective, because HCA compete it.
9608 2018-03-19 00:04:38 my latest favorite thing is dipping garlic bread in an olive oil vinaigrette and thanks to the auburn men's basketball team i will be doing a lot of that tonight
9609 2018-03-19 00:03:48 @NorahODonnell is the WORST! Second only to @ScottPelley @60Minutes borders on unwatchable. (Which is sad, bc at one time I looked forward to watching.)
9610 2018-03-19 00:03:31 Thank God for Olbas Oil
9611 2018-03-19 00:03:23 Other thing no one talks about about California: lots of oil, especially near LA, e.g Chevron.

Also how Hollywood locked down film industry is well-covered in Tim Wu’s “The Master Switch”.
9612 2018-03-19 00:03:21 The NERVES of the 27% not supporting oil and global warming.
9613 2018-03-19 00:03:13 She's our oil..
9614 2018-03-19 00:03:01 It would likely be the single greatest rearrangement  to a new order.  Russia has nothing anyone wants except for arms, gas & oil.  They lack tech to get the oil out cheaply.   Many don’t understand that much of the current Russian agressiveness is fundamentally about oil.
9615 2018-03-19 00:02:50 As soon as my roommate saw my sunburns she covered me in coconut oil and now I smell so WEIRD
9616 2018-03-19 00:02:25 What makes an oil essential? Who decides that?

9619 2018-03-19 00:02:07 BC can buy foreign oil like eastern Canada does.
9620 2018-03-19 00:02:02 Are you scouting for uranium mine sites or oil well sites creep?
9621 2018-03-19 00:01:57 bruh it’s time for an oil change AGAIN
9622 2018-03-19 00:01:54 whole thing was a cover- to tell us it was one thing, when really- it was the other. Hasn't it ever struck you? Doesn't it ever bother- the deeper parts of you to know that Google, Yahoo, Microsoft ARE the Industrial Giants? Just of another resource now, not gas, or oil or water?
9623 2018-03-19 00:01:45 But in northern Alberta, the oil industry is removing the tar from the soil. Why are you opposed this cleanup effort?
9624 2018-03-19 00:01:37 Stole a 57$ oil fragrance bc it was called “Double Cross” and bc the stores name, Boy Fort, both aroused and annoyed me! – bij Case Study Coffee
9625 2018-03-19 00:01:34 oddly Obama allowed the NA tar sands oil pipeline and put more  oots into Afgan, oddly Trumps tax plan has had an anti tax avoidance effect on googles money laundering system google irl)

9627 2018-03-19 00:00:55 Roasted with olive oil, salt, and lemon.
9628 2018-03-19 00:00:53 You're an idiot, Pipeline is the safest way to transport oil. What about all the sewage Victoria dumps into the ocean? You enviro lunatics never have an answer for that
9629 2018-03-19 00:00:41 I would argue 1970's were result of supply shock rather demand shift (2 oil crises when oil mattered as key input) so stagflation was due Yom Kippur/Iran Iraq wars rather than failed Keynesianism. Besides no one ever practiced his theories as he preached them (no surplus saving)
9630 2018-03-19 00:00:24 On the stove, fried, in the teensiest bit of oil

9632 2018-03-19 00:00:19 OIL DIFF: 3.97 -> 4.1
9633 2018-03-19 00:00:10 When you work for a charlatan you get toxic snake oil all over you.
9634 2018-03-19 00:00:07 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
9635 2018-03-19 00:00:03 The mask smells like chocolate mint due to the abundance of peppermint oil that helps tone and refresh the skin to leave it feeling rejuvenated.  We're thrilled to hear you're loving the mask!
