45 2018-02-28 21:00:38 My distinction is between "commodity" and "financial asset" which I think get used interchangeably, and shouldn't. But commodities (as a rule) get mass-produced and are responsive to prices. We'd be better off if housing did.

60 2018-02-28 19:58:04 In 2016, for the 7th straight year, Minnesota was the nation's top state for business volume conducted by agricultural cooperatives. The state conducted $21.4 billion in gross business from marketing farm commodities, selling farm supplies, or providing services.
61 2018-02-28 19:47:13 Thats not as material as the macro data coming out of China. But it would cause a move. The bigger picture is how hedge funds have gone over 90% net long on most inflation commodities in 2017 and now have to unwind as macro data reverses.
62 2018-02-28 19:44:00 I saw that...not good for most commodities. I might have to rethink long hogs which is being driven by cash market right now. Open interest has been dropping which has been attractive.

72 2018-02-28 19:01:11 Actually, that's Anarchy. You're thinking of anarchists there.
Socialists demand the government steals from the rich and gives the money back to the poor class. As well as making commodities free or affordable, and all other sorts of things.
73 2018-02-28 19:00:57 Who said “I” take dogs from their mothers? Stop being silly.  

I’m against breeding animals as “pets”, “livestock” etc because they are NOT commodities.  I believe in rescuing/adopting animals (dogs, pigs, etc who need care).  

Adopting kids is fine, trafficking kids is not.

I don't see a this roadmap playing out without primarily: weaker USD, higher commodities, and growth led by China. In this situation, high asset prices should lead to people spending.
77 2018-02-28 18:42:19 So I will celebrate the scarcity of commodities and the rice contracts. Please I love my country, not sure that I loved the Government of that time. The only good thing were the cooperatives that emerged amongst the women.

89 2018-02-28 17:50:49 I think a lot of us got  taught the Black Nationalist version of chattel slavery, which tends to minimize the role that Africans played in selling other africans for textiles, alcohol ect. they make it seam like everyone was war captives instead of "commodities"

114 2018-02-28 15:37:04 That's what treasury bonds or stable commodities are supposed to be for, not real estate. If real estate gave minimal returns, they'd find another vehicle that was similarly stable but with better returns
115 2018-02-28 15:35:57 Gopal, you value such commodities players at a PE multiple of 25? On a long term sustainable basis, these companies will not trade at more than 12 multiple which justifies the current valuation.

122 2018-02-28 15:15:50 long term commodities will go up. Asia needs them all.
123 2018-02-28 15:10:16 Sold about 2/3 of gold bought usci (commodities).  Commodities at long term lows. Inflation, higher wages will increase commodity prices.  And I see the dollar tanking, can't say when but it will happen.  Too much debt.
124 2018-02-28 15:07:51 Trying to figure out how the pay raise made a difference when the prices of commodities hiked and an increase of two to three dollars per dish in local food businesses or franchises.
125 2018-02-28 15:07:42 Looks like wheat is on the upswing all of a sudden. Wonder if all the vol in the stock market is making grains look favorable? It's about time for another commodities boom!
126 2018-02-28 15:07:05 $TLT $GLD $EURO $UWT $GDXJ all hitting lows for the morning simultaneously. Commodities are getting hit hard. Curious to see if the $SPY can continue to diverge from the other macro elements. Everything else is pointing to a huge down move in equities, but it hasn't happened yet
127 2018-02-28 15:02:53 theyre so damn rich already but they still find ways to further treat their artists as mere commodities to get money- THIS, this is why capitalism is a fckin fucked up system.
128 2018-02-28 15:01:41 591T all due from Jan1 until today. Tomorrow is the first... then we start adding more tons to that number. Grain buyer says they don’t foresee us being able to haul commodities for another 5-6 weeks

133 2018-02-28 14:52:23 I want a world in which sentient beings are given the justice they deserve and are no longer treated as commodities.  Farmers who say they care already give animals moral consideration. I want that consideration extended to its logical conclusion: veganism (minimum). #Februdairy
134 2018-02-28 14:47:21 Of course....it says news madness, and we couldn't agree more in case of Rs 10000 crore #NSEL fraud, where no commodities were found in warehouse when fraud happened.

138 2018-02-28 14:31:28 I appreciate that they should have checked TARIC before running the story, but the point holds. The EU chooses to discriminate (esp in TBT/SPS regs, but also in tariffs and TRQs) against those countries which could profit from increased export of improved commodities.
139 2018-02-28 14:25:01 I am good with it. Free market would be nice. But that can't happen till commodities aren't traded any more and that won't happen. Farmers have no choice at all what they sell their product for unless it is to a private business or individual.
140 2018-02-28 14:22:33 Tras 30 años de crecimiento y mandatos presidenciales limitados, China se vuelve a convertir en dictadura hereditaria. Podrá India ocupar el lugar de China en la demanda de commodities o estamos fritos?
141 2018-02-28 14:11:57 All great fortunes have ultimately been made on the simple commodities which the poorest people need. The more those at the bottom have to spend the richer those at the top (and those in between) will become. Re-distribution is investment and growth. Trickles go down the drain.

229 2018-02-28 04:15:28 Star Wars was designed as a hyper-commodity; not so much a film as a fictional system - a plane of consistency that could be populated with any number of commodities. The switch is from a system of objects to a hype-system where what is sold is abstract, fictional - but very real
230 2018-02-28 04:11:45 The same guy who called our children COMMODITIES? MY CHILDREN ARE NOT YOUR OIL DUDE!
231 2018-02-28 04:05:24 Did he? Really? It wasnt the strength of the chinese economy & their appetite 4 our commodities? Our strong banking system? The strong no-net debt position left by Howard/Costello?
Would we've been fucked by those that followed? Or have they been fucked by actions of Krudd/Swan?

235 2018-02-28 03:00:32 In the US Children are consumers the moment they open their eyes.  They'll be taught everything they need is a commodity bought. They'll learn their thoughts,  feelings and dreams are commodities to be sold...
236 2018-02-28 03:00:31 It's beautiful how financial markets prevent full fledged war! Destroy prices of exported commodities, ruin it's investment markets and the war is already won
237 2018-02-28 02:53:19 Días pasado se conocían buenas cifras del sector Comercio  (calculadas por ellos mismos), luego el aumento de las exportaciones y en particular algunas agropecuarias, después la recuperación de algunos precios de commodities, pero algunos siguen  insistiendo en la CRISIS.
238 2018-02-28 02:51:44 Those who understand it buy only when prices are low with the idea of selling when they are high; and they operate only in the stocks or commodities which they can move best so they may secure the highest possible rate of turnover of inventories.

245 2018-02-28 02:39:03 Reality hits hard on bang hajis. fuel cost is up 127%
Utility bills up by 400%. General commodities at an average of 8%. 
246 2018-02-28 02:33:40 Many food, drug and other essential commodities gave gone up. No reduction in seen in most of the places affecting many middle class house holds.
247 2018-02-28 02:19:17 Perhaps because the prison system is run by  private businessness paid for in our tax dollars. Mass incarceration is a huge business in America. People are commodities. What’s happening?

251 2018-02-28 01:56:51 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
252 2018-02-28 01:51:37 That would require effort and interest.  Those are two commodities I lack.
253 2018-02-28 01:50:33 Kids walking out of school, families not going to work. It takes that commitment to effect businesspeople as commodities.
254 2018-02-28 01:44:40 Are there any Black Hockey Players that are hot commodities?  Even though the game was created by runaway slaves, its Historically white?

257 2018-02-28 01:33:55 Other than “dividend growth stocks” the asset classes are pretty standard. They don’t invest in direct commodities, but that can be defended. The portfolio construction methodology will matter quite a bit though.

259 2018-02-28 01:32:41 No worries. I live in hope for a time when such malignant characters are viewed by @twitter as calamities rather than commodities.
260 2018-02-28 01:24:44 El endeudamiento en dólares para una economía emergente dependiente de commodities es una trampa autodestructiva. "Original Sin"...
261 2018-02-28 01:08:40 A historic and proven #Inflation hedge in #Commodities is selling off in #USD, while a currency losing 10% vs its peers, likely losing more than 2% adjusted to inflation, and printed to infinity got the safe haven bid. As long as it always says $1 face value, sheep are happy.
262 2018-02-28 01:06:15 Generally, a decline in Chinese data is considered negatively for the Aussie dollar. Conversely, an upbeat round of numbers are deemed positive. 

Australian economic growth relies heavily on exporting raw commodities. China has become the biggest trading partner of Australia.

265 2018-02-28 00:48:25 "Fue un modelo dañino y sin éxito de desarrollo", "..descansaron en los precios altos de las commodities", "..hubo una corrupción enorme". Esto piensa Chomsky sobre los gobiernos de izquierda populista como el de @MashiRafael; quien tampoco aplicó la teoría del Socialismo S. XXI

267 2018-02-28 00:45:36 @MaureenManos Ever been in board meeting discussing commodities?Consumers & human resources. 1 makes money, 1 costs money
268 2018-02-28 00:36:04 Investment banks are terrible when making calls on commodities generally. They said the Iron Ore price would crash for over a decade before it actually did.
269 2018-02-28 00:34:36 Na verdade estão falando como são as coisas pra eles e pra maioria: animais “de produção” são “commodities”, ou como o reply que recebi: eles estão aí pra gente comer mesmo
270 2018-02-28 00:28:41 Sure.  But to control the real value of the debt, one must also control the pricing of commodities, and specifically, oil.  I find this incredibly misunderstood by investors.  This is the key to the CNY oil contract.  It breaks the USD's ctrl of commodities, & therefore USD debt
271 2018-02-28 00:24:50 Used to be too cheap to buy butter but now since I have a big kid job I can afford such commodities. Feeling like a privileged colonial settler.
272 2018-02-28 00:02:44 The natural target would psy' $20. Eyes on the $CRB, as commodities are still m/t bullish.
