Is a bank bailout not a handout? 
Is 50B over the past few years to Israel not a handout?

46 2018-07-26 23:46:04 Funny thing is the idea that stocks represent "potential value" has never been truer than here, since the platform has little actual value beyond ad space. Seems like this won't kill them or even really hurt?

53 2018-07-26 23:42:10 Hey Bakari. Even though that’s huge. It’s misleading. I’m not a stocks person, even though I can interpret trends and gains. For most companies that would be a tremendous loss. Remember, it’s Facebook. Large, REALLY big. That amount (get this) is only a 3 month gain.

66 2018-07-26 23:35:06 Good point Peter however I found small cap resource stocks in the ASX did the same and more during the mining boom. Specifically stocks like FMG.ASX went from 10c to over $13 at their peak. From my experience bubbles all trade the same, no matter the market. Happy trading.
67 2018-07-26 23:34:21 LOL OK, I just have a Business Degree, IT Diploma in Web Programming & Certificates for licensing to Sell Stocks, Bonds & Insurance. How about you tell me what your point is & what I should read specifically? In fact, post it on Reddit for real discussion if you feel so confident
68 2018-07-26 23:33:38 Global liberal media folks are grinning from ear to ear, crossing their fingers that Facebook will go down. Loss of stocks is nothing compared to loss of influence.

82 2018-07-26 23:22:50 IMO its knowing what stocks have the highest odds/potential for a nasty fade to maximize and which ones we should nail & bail. If we always have the nail & nail mindset we are not maximising our potential. Its obviously easier said then done :p
83 2018-07-26 23:22:33 Crude prices rallied as #Saudi Arabia suspended shipments in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait after two tankers were attacked by #Yemeni #Houthis. Meanwhile #US #crude stocks have dropped to their lowest point since 2015 reflecting ongoing tightness in the market.
84 2018-07-26 23:21:48 That's why Obama allowed the Fed to Artificially Inseminate the Stock Market to the tune of 85 Billion a month for 6 years.
They over valuated stocks without real money behind it.

103 2018-07-26 23:11:15 It's because of the float...that why I like low float stocks
104 2018-07-26 23:09:56 1/2 I prefer to look at EV/EBITDA for auto/RV stocks since it accounts for debt. Thor traded at roughly 6X EBITDA going into the recession, fell as low as 2.5, and then traded between 6-10 when earnings began normalizing again in 2011.

110 2018-07-26 23:06:31 "bad losses" shouldn't be a strong determining factor in rankings. Smash 4 is a wild game: 2 stocks, rage, tons of ways to die at 40%. Consistency is impressive but getting a couple Ls in a season isn't unreasonable enough to be punished hard for.

138 2018-07-26 22:50:05 South Korea just legalize marijuana, do y’all know how big this is for stocks in India and Asia? That’s why they really making more jobs in America cause Asia ain’t fixing to do “LOTF” slave work when they got it for themselves Asia is set now.
139 2018-07-26 22:49:48 No worries, Zuckerberg cashed out most of his stocks prior to losing $15b. 

Figures.
140 2018-07-26 22:49:42 Tech stocks have ups and downs (remember the bending iPhone effect on $appl ?). Is $fb done going up? Don’t think so
141 2018-07-26 22:48:55 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity glad to see Facebook stocks heading south. To bad he got away with selling off massive shares weeks ago. Let's go after that $$$ as well the sale of Rothschild's family estate. Time for them to feel some real pain of what it has been like for others!
142 2018-07-26 22:48:14 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Watching you show today about raising cash.  How do I know what stocks to sell?  How do I determine which stocks to sell off to raise cash?
143 2018-07-26 22:48:06 Obama, John Brennan and the CIA's 2012 creation-ISIS, funded by Saudi Arabia! ISIS trained+armed by the CIA, UK's MI6, French, Israeli and Saudi  Intel, with Hillary Clinton sending ISIS captured stocks of Libyan weapons from Benghazi!

145 2018-07-26 22:46:42 I'm done with sick people trying to bash stocks to get in for cheaper. Guys like pitman and slicetrader on $FLTT board I'm giving you a fair warning here. I will expose you. Just worry about your fat $DCAC instead of making up "gaps" that need to fill...
146 2018-07-26 22:46:17 real talk, though, having dated somebody who got them, companies ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT give you any form of alternative compensation. They won't give you a raise instead, don't wanna pay bonuses - it's stocks or fucking nothing.
147 2018-07-26 22:46:08 As more and more young people invest in Crypto, to what extent will this affect daily volatility across stocks such as $FB ,  $SNAP , $TWTR
Will we see more volatility in Stocks due to crypto over the coming years?

149 2018-07-26 22:45:51 I’m trying to figure out what caused this tank for Facebook stocks. #MarkZuckerberg
150 2018-07-26 22:45:48 I don't care what they think anymore.  If McCarthy wins, we would be laughing stocks anyways.  Meadows is too much of a Paul Ryan.
151 2018-07-26 22:45:46 European stocks opened higher o/n, pushing world stocks to new 4 month highs after the EU & the US agreed to negotiate on trade, easing some of the fears of a trans-Atlantic trade war. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 27 points higher at 6,224.
152 2018-07-26 22:44:45 Facebook stocks drop by billions after scandal, WhatsApp exploiting affairs, ppl seemingly uneasy with IG... The best time to gain market share but,  Twitter programmers dem sleeping.
153 2018-07-26 22:43:39 omg i really dont know how the foreign stocks buying would work hahahaha.. may chance kaya na pwede akong makabili from here sa ph? lol
154 2018-07-26 22:43:25 Maybe all the #FAANG stocks will tank causing my  $SPY puts to do some work
155 2018-07-26 22:43:23 Not sure why Amazon shares fell so much today-- 2.8% only to rise 3% after hours.  Also, I can understand Facebook falling, but it took a beating.  It's a buying opportunity now.   #stocks #FANG
156 2018-07-26 22:43:19 I wish I understood stocks.
157 2018-07-26 22:42:13 Sorry, Bernie.  Those same people are part of the 401K that grows when stocks and profits go up. Those profits are taxed so Gov Rev just went up. Workers have feet…if don’t like what they get they can walk. Welcome to America, Bernie. Capitalism at work.

161 2018-07-26 22:39:34 I guess Zuckerberg is at home right about now crying & getting drunk now that Facebook lost Billions & their stocks dropped BIG TIME on Wall Street? Well, at least he has his Asian wife to eat some Chop Suey & egg rolls with & make him feel better.

167 2018-07-26 22:37:19 Right! because for the @SEC_News today penny stocks are not much worse and do bring more societal value than crypto. Np, SEC, take your time and let foreign ETFs frolic in a brand new ultra-high growth commodity until after the US gets only leftovers. Tip: it's a WORLD asset. 
168 2018-07-26 22:36:15 Senile former trump attorney on @AriMelber saying Cohen attorney doing everything to help Clinton'snit Cohen. WTF? She responsible fro FB stocks tanking too?

170 2018-07-26 22:35:57 3 out of 4 FANG stocks have now guided lower than expected on growth. The last time this happened, the term FANG wasn't coined. Keep in mind, this is a data point for longer term direction change. Next Q results would be extremely interesting

171 2018-07-26 22:34:55 Hey, all @jack has to do is look at the kneecapping Zuckerberg took today. #facebook stocks tanked. If this b.s. from Twitter keeps up, he may not be far behind.

200 2018-07-26 22:22:02 The gains we seen from FB still outweighs today’s shellacking. Sticks go up. Stocks go down. If you invest for the long term it always works in you’re favor. Now day traders? Some of those had a really bad day ;)

208 2018-07-26 22:18:26 Robinhood isn’t created for day trading, especially day trading shitty illiquid penny stocks. Not only that but did you check the spread? Probably was wide and just didn’t notice. Don’t blame the technology, it’s you as a trader.

211 2018-07-26 22:17:53 Yes I agree so many stocks I bought I ended up losing money instead of a profit on bc I got scared and sold when people screamed dillution. The Stock market is an easy game if you have patience and wits.

232 2018-07-26 22:10:55 The way you get rid of shadow banning is to boycott advertisers that support this practice. Stocks will fall just like Facebook. Sick and tired of my conservative voice being censored and muted.
233 2018-07-26 22:10:47 If you are tired of the so call narrowness of the market and feel out sync when the the “market” is up and your stocks are down, then just own the index.
234 2018-07-26 22:10:20 @MarketWatch People should not invest in social media companies at all—like Facebook. Buy stocks of companies that give jobs to people- Walmart, airlines, manufacturing companies, Publix, etc. Amazon is a big online consignment business that you can’t trust

243 2018-07-26 22:07:32 Why do we not hear from the companies that have made plastic goods for years, earned vast fortunes & stocks shares ,are never mentioned or brought  up when are they going to invest millions to help they CAUSED IT.
244 2018-07-26 22:06:05 Facebook is one of the "FANG" stocks.

F Facebook
A Amazon
N Netflix
G Google

Those four stocks on their own, have account for most of the recent gains. Fang stock losses are the tipping point everyone has been waiting for.

Crash Soon?

266 2018-07-26 21:59:21 Stocks are good in a way but crypto is awesome
267 2018-07-26 21:57:55 Right on James, to attack their stocks best way to let them know that heir bias, sucks
268 2018-07-26 21:56:53 Never bought into the leftist run stocks of any kind. Scum like them deserve nothing from me. That's why I have all my ad blockers maxed out on these sites.
269 2018-07-26 21:56:40 Since Facebook stocks are crashing does this mean Tom can bring MySpace back for us?
270 2018-07-26 21:56:35 Fractional shares dipshit. They were issued today, so everyone sold them as soon as they could.
271 2018-07-26 21:55:57 That’s what I’m gonna do, if it goes well I’ll throw more in as it’s better interest than a Stocks and Shares ISA, but I won’t throw anything sizeable/my whole savings, just a portion of leftover money outside of my current budgeting each month I guess.

275 2018-07-26 21:54:02 $FB earnings report sent a wakeup call that there's no safety net in the tech sector. Interesting to see where market goes in the next 3 months if tech levels out

290 2018-07-26 21:47:39 Right, to Jennifer’s point stocks fluctuate all the time. Honestly, you have to research trends, the market, and how the stock did a yr, 3 yrs, 5 yrs ago.

But I’m telling you that you won’t seen any quick and large returns unless your investing in $5000, $10,000+

296 2018-07-26 21:45:01 RIP anyone who invested in Facebook stocks

309 2018-07-26 21:40:22 I have #Facebook going back up to $195 in the shortterm. In my opinion, these losses are premature. What are your thoughts? #investments #stockmarket #stocks

328 2018-07-26 21:28:02 So, about baseball cards...

Their value isn't actually an indicator of the quality of those represented.
Their value is arbitrary, and has no firm connection with reality at all.
You shouldn't bank your retirement on their value.

Did I say baseball cards? I meant stocks.
329 2018-07-26 21:27:32 FB stocks dropped 110 Billion basically overnight

336 2018-07-26 21:25:46 yeah that makes more sense. Stocks are fun like that lol
337 2018-07-26 21:25:27 But with fishing rights split between haves and have nots and rampant overfishing of the major stocks back then meant today's consequences were bound to happen. Opportunism for the non TAC species means you fish one stock down then move on... But this is flawed thinking.
338 2018-07-26 21:25:25 Correct, in the sense of a static hit, but stocks are dynamic and he definitely knows it can go right back up next quarter. Plus, it’s not as if he sells stock every day to live life.
339 2018-07-26 21:24:43 MoviePass surging price algorithm tries to get rid of the abusive users and make money. While AMC tries to kill MoviePass with A-List, which will reduce the revenue for the next quarter and so on.

355 2018-07-26 21:20:52 Explain this to me. You start a trade war. Have prices skyrocket. Have stocks tumble. Force companies to ship factory jobs overseas. Then claim all is well.
356 2018-07-26 21:20:36 It’s decent, good way to save and make money at same time, I love football so it makes sense, it’s similar to normal stocks, demand, performance etc, get dividends for media and daily perfomances

383 2018-07-26 21:10:30 I remember back in high school, how popular MySpace was, but do we even talk about it anymore? I was like you would have to be a fool to buy Facebook stocks, we are the product, and we aren't paying for it, so how do they get their money?  And btw, we are so unreliable.
384 2018-07-26 21:10:07 can't afford a crash based on bank exposure to risk and the CPP's exposure to banks & energy stocks. government can't afford to but that many pension funds at risk and would just prop it up anyways.

425 2018-07-26 20:59:51 It won't be long before you are saying Bitcoin was down 10% last night, we lost the entire market cap of all the Fang Stocks.
426 2018-07-26 20:59:00 ha. nope, no direct ownership in any platforms, tech, media stocks... easiest way for me to eliminate conflicts. If I have an opinion, it's based on studying the industry.
427 2018-07-26 20:58:53 Must be why paychecks are up. Stocks are up. Jobs are everywhere, unemployment is down. My taxes are less. Yeah... All terrible things. It was way better under Obama when you couldn't buy a job. 
428 2018-07-26 20:58:46 Damn bro them Facebook stocks took a HIT today 
429 2018-07-26 20:58:28 Sounds like #Facebook stocks are on sale!
430 2018-07-26 20:58:15 Soon, we’ll be able to say that about a lot of stocks 
431 2018-07-26 20:58:03 People don’t invest in #crypto because is “too risky” and they have most of their portfolio in stocks where they will face for sure, soon, a bear market, potentially losing 70% #winteriscoming
432 2018-07-26 20:58:02 Hola @adolfo_stocks  estás hecho un monstruo buscando empresas,ya lo eras en visionarios y lo eres cada vez más,naciste pa esto macho. ¿Vas a ir publicando ideas de inversión? Sería de gran ayuda para nosotros :) ¿Te podemos seguir en algún sitio además de twitter ? Lo odio xDD
433 2018-07-26 20:57:50 Some tech stocks really taking it in the shorts, and yet the DJIA keeps rising.
434 2018-07-26 20:57:33 Also.. do more. Speak less. Not the other way around. Everyone knows that. Just venting. Stupid antibiotic stocks ... 
435 2018-07-26 20:57:00  GDP, unemployment, stocks, wages, taxes, trade deals... Pretty sure it isn't us who doesn't get it. Lol
436 2018-07-26 20:56:44 I had the volume down on that Trump video. Q: is that the speech where he suggests that bump stocks are “gone” and where due process comes after the jack boots confiscate firearms first?
437 2018-07-26 20:56:17 I’ve been asking myself why Facebook stocks in the market suddenly dropped
438 2018-07-26 20:56:10 No one can really answer that question because stocks are not guaranteed to increase. I would start with getting a strong financial foundation and doing as much research as possible on how everything works before buying anything.
439 2018-07-26 20:55:45 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close lower as Facebook weighs.
440 2018-07-26 20:55:42 Sad. Then even I would buy cryto but it must be easy to trade like Stocks.
441 2018-07-26 20:55:09 Stocks mixed today. NASDAQ down. Dow up. TREND STILL UP, NO HEDGES. Risk still on. I am moving up stops and enjoying the ride.
442 2018-07-26 20:55:06 Is it possible in 5 minutes?  Stocks for fb up.
443 2018-07-26 20:53:16 #investors #investing #stocks #stockmarket #finance  Time stamp 4:50 P.M. ETS.
First take-away, both Dow Jones 30 and 20 stochastics are above 80--that is over-bought territory.  The NASDAQ is very near a sell signal.
444 2018-07-26 20:53:07 Before you swear off stocks because of Facebook's 20% loss today, realize that it went up 500% over the last five years.  #perspective. Long term investing works.
445 2018-07-26 20:52:47 strange, I don't think it's dramatic to be worried about whether people who need them will still have access to medicine, where the English are going to get their power from (whoever submitted A50 at the end of winter when British fuel stocks are depleted?!).
446 2018-07-26 20:52:22 #stocks
The sell-off vaporized about $119 billion in market value — the biggest single-day loss for any public company in history, according to Thomson Reuters.
447 2018-07-26 20:52:08 There should be a study of stock names. Do stocks with family names perform better than others? Or maybe companies named after real life things do better
448 2018-07-26 20:51:56 I’m positive you can make a ton of money shorting stocks especially on days like this. Not like it’ll go up you probably still can get some money
449 2018-07-26 20:51:39 I can just see #MarkZuckerberg tweet to #3WordsICannotStand ... @facebook stocks collapse
450 2018-07-26 20:51:38 Can Facebook stocks go up in next 10 minutes?  Wood panel mom pics and bend over clothes for men on computer.  Make it happen.
451 2018-07-26 20:51:33 $AMZN #earnings showed #stocks can be up it's impossible for aany company to beat on every metric hope $NFLX investors know that as long as u belive in the roadmap
452 2018-07-26 20:51:29 Yawn. Stocks, esp sexy ones, are worth whatever everybody thinks everybody thinks they're worth. Reality hasn't changed, nor have FB's fundamentals, just b/c of today's price drop.
453 2018-07-26 20:51:27 Twitter your stocks will fall soon stop #shadowbanning
454 2018-07-26 20:51:10 @Macys your website is such a nightmare to use/navigate. If you’re wondering why your stocks are in the crapper, your crap website might be why. U multiply items in my bag that I have to remove, gwp selections glitch so I can’t select gwp I qualify for. I’m abandoning my cart!
455 2018-07-26 20:50:37 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $NLSN, $FB, $MHK, $ABMD, and $SYF.
456 2018-07-26 20:49:58 Slow transport and unreliable communications used to mean that all businesses kept lots of stock, so that when things went wrong they had what they needed. Now we have just-in-time, and low stocks because that saves £. If a newt sneezed they would run out.
457 2018-07-26 20:49:55 The irony is that it came after stocks rose yesterday following Trump's announcement on trade with the EU.
458 2018-07-26 20:49:35 I do most of that too. Where I'm different is I spend some of the fortune by visiting merchants and buying all their stocks of important items (healing items, ammo etc.) and then stockpiling those as well. 
459 2018-07-26 20:49:35 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $AMD, $ARNC, $DHI, $XLNX, and $ALK.
460 2018-07-26 20:49:14 Does Zuckerberg’s A.I./ET eyes get bigger the further his stocks drop. Then when the market bottoms out does he shapeshift into the slime lizard he knows he is?
461 2018-07-26 20:48:22 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $FB, $F, $GE, and $BAC.
462 2018-07-26 20:48:06 the entire barbershop was talking crypto and stocks — completely stayed out of that conversation.
463 2018-07-26 20:48:04 Revenues miss and guidelines soft. Earnings strong. However you must be perfect when you are priced for perfection like tech stocks today
464 2018-07-26 20:46:55 Personally Im not into stocks yet this is my cryptocurrency portfolio
465 2018-07-26 20:45:58 Our personal taxes will be lower next year, and what we have in stocks are making money and unemployment is the lowest it has been in years. I like Trump's SCOTUS picks and I like Trump is strong on illegal immigration.
466 2018-07-26 20:45:52 For people out there who have investment dollars tied to FB or to funds that include FB stocks, it’s definitely not imaginary money
467 2018-07-26 20:44:37 So how long would it take for these stocks to turn around or increase?
468 2018-07-26 20:44:33 FB stocks truck -18.96% well you want to run with the liberals and Democrats tand keep shadowban people and they're free speech yep they you go I hope you crumble
469 2018-07-26 20:44:30 Let me seriously look into shorting some of these stocks 
470 2018-07-26 20:43:35 Plays outta the gate tomorrow $AMZN $EA $ATVI $CMG $WDC $EXPE

471 2018-07-26 20:42:16 No one is short since reverse split management is converting shares to cash to pay bills as fast as they can.

474 2018-07-26 20:40:46 Bank of India share price rose nearly 9% today (1month high), partly due to its huge gold holdings, 1 year chart suggests it will continue the rise. #Forex #Trading #Daytrader #Stocks #Shares #eToro #Tips #Finance
475 2018-07-26 20:40:42 … Also stocks are extremely up and job numbers look great and we just got a huge boost from the EU… But hey please share with us those five seconds that you need to dote on today
476 2018-07-26 20:37:42 When it happens, the value of stock have a correction. Often it's very hard correction. Because, well, people over-speculated the growth. So for a long term investor Benjamin Graham suggested not to invest in growth stocks for the inevitable correction.
477 2018-07-26 20:37:40 $SPY slightly green on the day. tons of #Earnings just announced like $AMZN $INTL $SBUX. Tomorrow all eyes are on that GDP number. have a great day y'all!!

478 2018-07-26 20:37:04 Great news! According to @Pride_Fund, the public responses to the ATF's proposed ban on bump stocks were overwhelmingly positive. Thanks to comments left by the Youth Coalition and citizens all across the country, calls to ban bump stocks beat negative comments by 3 to 1.
479 2018-07-26 20:36:55 "Watch on Facebook"....I guess this explains why their stocks plunged! 
480 2018-07-26 20:36:10 @JoeTalkShow Facebook stocks drop 19% after POTUS vows to investigate them for the illegal shadow banning practice!  Kudos POTUS, expose those left wing Hippocratic nut jobs!
481 2018-07-26 20:35:04 Growth stocks are stock of which the growth of value is higher than the market average. In hindsight, it may look like a good idea to invest in them. But mostly growth stocks are speculative on growth of the company which is bound to stall at some point.
482 2018-07-26 20:34:54 Im going minute details w/ stocks investment & businesses, I'll probably set up shops in Toronto do something learn something could be work on a focus point.
483 2018-07-26 20:34:49  and if Trump is elected the stock market will crash so sell off all you’re stocks
484 2018-07-26 20:34:24 Going LONG on popcorn stocks.
485 2018-07-26 20:32:56 You wont be able to trade the company’s stocks or,  options, any more by then. It will be taken over.
486 2018-07-26 20:32:51 This is going to happen regardless of any legislation or lobbying. Just like POTUS ban on bump stocks. Laws can't and won't be able to keep up with technology and people who don't care about the laws will break them.
487 2018-07-26 20:32:46 Awwwww facebook stocks fell 20%  a new record. Congrats Zuckerberg
488 2018-07-26 20:32:32 I mean the photo kind of undercut your point before you made it, so I’m confused as to what you’re going for here...

Are we not looking at the same synthetic plant that every dollar store stocks?
489 2018-07-26 20:32:32 With current Russian wheat prices much lower than EU, Russia likely to export more or similar to last year in first half of Marketing year. With stocks coming down local prices will go up and Govt may intervene.
490 2018-07-26 20:32:12 Stock market is artificially inflated by the top 1% buying and selling stocks with there tax cuts. Looking at the stock market is terrible practice for wealth, pay gap and median wage of poorest 10% is where you need to look. The gap is growing.
491 2018-07-26 20:32:10 Its been great for me. My stocks are up, taxes low, and got a raise this year. I appreciate his focus on securing the border. Globally, NK has agreed to suspend nuke tests & ISIS is all but forgotten. It's a good time to be an American. Turn of the MSM and enjoy life a little.
492 2018-07-26 20:31:51 US stocks ended today session mixed, with the Dow closing at its highest level in five months. The Dow Jones ended up 0.4%, marking its third straight gain and its highest close since Feb. 26. The S&P 500 ended 0.3% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite, finished the day off 1%
493 2018-07-26 20:31:26 Facebook stocks are plummeting.... Zuckerberg loses 16B today....
494 2018-07-26 20:30:54 PORTFOLIO up 0.4% today - I'd get more excited if I felt it was the start of a move up but I suspect we have more of this Summer grind to endure. Volatility is very high with some crazy swings on my Stocks during the day.
495 2018-07-26 20:30:51 A plunge in Facebook Inc's shares pushed the Nasdaq down more than 1 percent on Thursday, the index's biggest one-day drop in a month, but industrial stocks rose after the United States and the European Union said they would negotiate
496 2018-07-26 20:30:28 $AMZN Weak AWS revenue from Amazon. Losing share. 49% growth vs $MSFT who delivered 89% for Azure at a much much lower valuation! #stocks

499 2018-07-26 20:28:47 Many people who are neither Short or long, feel this way. They were told there would be a $35,000 car. I was excited way, way back in the beginning. You seem to think any negativity has to do with stocks. It's called being completely mislead.
500 2018-07-26 20:28:43 Keep in mind ALL the global warming predictions from the 1990's about how hot it would be the past ten years have all been wrong! But you still believe them! If someone gave you predictions about stocks that were all wrong, I bet you would NOT believe them!
501 2018-07-26 20:27:43 more stocks than not in some of the biggest names and the WS darlings over the last years have been clocked from 5-15% on earn reports for q2. Amazing the level of volatility that isn't seen in the VIX or other place where fears hunker down.
502 2018-07-26 20:27:09 If higher real rates are the result of higher gdp growth and more confidence about the future, why would stocks sink? Bonds on the other hand...
503 2018-07-26 20:26:27 @TraderBlake Tomorrow it should crash. It’s Friday no one likes to hold long over weekend on low stocks

goal: take 2 stocks (can be in different games)
514 2018-07-26 20:23:58 Not a bad day $budd continues to gain traction $gtec pulled back with big support. See everyone tommo. Weed stocks getting close to bounce zone.
515 2018-07-26 20:23:52 What a shit week for stocks I am sitting in
516 2018-07-26 20:23:23 So investing in stocks wouldve been pretty nice, 5 yrs 3 times the return in some places. Big big money these last 5 yrs, economic booms among many my actions.
517 2018-07-26 20:23:18 nice 50 pt scalp on short side but damn that made me dizzy whatever happen to stock splits-- With this fed all stocks will be at 50k a share
518 2018-07-26 20:23:09 A friend of mine has been telling me that there is too much risk to navigate is crypto, and I should shore up my investment portfolio with less volatile stocks, like Facebook.

We just had a fun phone call.
519 2018-07-26 20:22:49 Ive been meaning to win stocks, play poker like 2007 but these days poker have a better player place entrench in & win rates at an all time low really.
520 2018-07-26 20:22:35 Do you wonder why stocks have dived?
521 2018-07-26 20:21:41 Yet WS is plugging AMD and Micron very hard as proof the sector goes on. There continues to be a narrative for everything until....Like very cycle higher on the day before it craters, stocks and indexes run
522 2018-07-26 20:21:30 Love that FB stocks dropped but... gotta admit... I’m waiting... somewhat patiently... for Mueller to be done... Huber to announce indictments. Ready to focus on the great things Trump does everyday.
523 2018-07-26 20:20:52 As I value stability, I am done trading in volatile stocks like Facebook, and henceforth will move all my investment portfolio to Bitcoin.
524 2018-07-26 20:20:39 Very true. If you look at my obnoxious, repetitive tweets, you'll see that, well, stocks will go up until the Fed lets them fall or they lose control. Hardly makes sense in free (yeah, right) mkts...Until then, buy all dips. Yippie!

528 2018-07-26 20:18:03 the only graph that wd pertain to "10 years" -the timeframe of my original comment- is the S&P 500 in the center:
one can see there how low the stocks were at the beginning of President Obama's first term & how the trend came up.
In short, you gave credence to my comments -thanks
529 2018-07-26 20:17:46 Just like his stocks portfolio, Pump & Dump.
530 2018-07-26 20:17:28 as if the OSRS team is going to have any say what-so-ever when their chinese overlords give the demand for them to add MTX to raise their stocks from 2.7 cents/share
531 2018-07-26 20:17:22 Mark Zuckerberg just lost $150,000,000,000.00.  Facebook stocks drop 20% today!

576 2018-07-26 20:00:05 I kinda disagree.  Reading stocks is more than looking at earnings and trade volumes, especially on soft goods like tech stocks.  Facebook and Zucks rep is suffering and so this was a lot of investors reading the trends and getting out early.

661 2018-07-26 19:25:05 Damn Zuck just got ZUCCED  FB stocks down 41%

667 2018-07-26 19:23:14 probably a good idea to go long on dividend paying stocks

674 2018-07-26 19:19:08 My wet dream: To buy shares in @money_button (with GROUP tokens). It would be like buying FANG stocks early times ten!

696 2018-07-26 19:11:02 First thing I would tell someone before even thinking about stocks is to learn the fundamentals of valuing a business. Forget the charts, the news, markets, economics, etc. Just learn financial statements and the business itself.

700 2018-07-26 19:09:20 Remarkable line from @mikeallen this am: "According to Merrill Lynch FAANG stocks (FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOG) were single-handedly responsible for S&P 500 being positive through the first half of 2018. Without them, the index’s first half performance would have been -0.73%."
701 2018-07-26 19:09:19 Facebook has today lost $100 billion in market cap.  It is the first company to lose such an amount in one day since early 2000 when Intel lost $91 billion in one  day. 

 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is $15 billion poorer. It's a wait and see whether the stocks will recover

708 2018-07-26 19:06:05 $fb dropping 20% is another example of why it's important not to chase stocks.  Consistent, planned, diversified investments may protect against the down turns of stocks.  The market goes up, down, and sideways...our focus should be to avoid big losses instead of chasing gains.

As a youngin, ur portiolio should be “diversified” aggressively w mostly stocks/ETFs and some bonds. As you get older, ur account should have a greater share of bonds.
794 2018-07-26 18:34:32 Spud stocks will be tight. Poland might take some of the market but I wouldn’t be surprised if their spuds magically become “Irish roosters” in the shops. @Bordbia need to look at their @OriginGreen brand and call out multiples that don’t know the meaning of sustainability.

796 2018-07-26 18:33:34 "The thing is, you only need to become a competent investor. For sure, it takes time and dedication to become competent, but it is a lot easier than becoming a professional."

803 2018-07-26 18:30:56 I don’t believe they’ll do well (on average), just that they can be rational about it based on their time frame / source of capital. Overall, charging 2 / 20 and trading just stocks is a very hard game if benchmark is S&P.

811 2018-07-26 18:28:53 I had this conversation with someone, and he said that, instead of complaining about the banks, I should just "buy bank stocks". he was serious. But it's not healthy for the economy, society and democracy to have so much money and power concentrated in so few hands.

909 2018-07-26 17:53:08 Back when I attempted to trade stocks, I thought a stop loss order would protect me against this sort of thing. Then I learned that stop orders were useless as most big drops happen overnight when regular folk like me can’t trade. I don’t trade anymore.
910 2018-07-26 17:52:53 Had long conv w/ actual financial advisor. He tried to get me to allocate much more of my money to growth stocks. Said, "Look at the market off lows early in year!"

912 2018-07-26 17:49:55 Just a note-- this type of 15-25% ER drop w/ FANG stocks ie. $NFLX $FB w.o huge recovery by month end is the kind of event that can change IT/LT trend on charts. If now broken ST monthly support 5/10/12m becomes resistance and starts to curl its slope could open up more selling.

916 2018-07-26 17:49:04 another thing to consider is that these large cap tech stocks never move in isolation.  $NFLX just had a big subscriber miss. And the Alphabet numbers are meaningful, maybe margins in the 20’s is actually normal and $FB is beginning a structural correction

918 2018-07-26 17:47:53 Right, but the damage was localized to the inherently risky FB. And, just to be unrelentingly negative, I noted that on your latest podcast–days before FB got hit–you and Ben essentially dissed other than *pure* software tech plays as "hw stocks" and inherently risky.

926 2018-07-26 17:44:15 To me this is the worst feature of Indian market. Foreigners are enriching themselves at cost of Indian. The wealth belongs to Indians and they take a slice away because they are smarter. If I remember correctly, about 35% of stocks in BSE 500 were owned by FIIs.
927 2018-07-26 17:43:08 Remember when it snowed for two days and old ladies were slitting each others throats for a loaf of bread in tesco? Any small interruption in supply has a huge effect on our supermarket stocks. A no deal brexit may cause a little supply wobble?

968 2018-07-26 17:27:57 ummm when stocks are going up, i.e. for the last 8 years, it's because money is coming into the stock market. companies are being rewarded for generating economic returns. So I can guarantee you there has been more money coming into the stock market than going out.

1000 2018-07-26 17:16:46 Extremely easy credit, like zero interest under the Obuma, and overly tight monetary policies by the Fed are the primary factors that caused the Depression.

They should look at their competitors stocks and see what happens when you block conservatives
1056 2018-07-26 16:58:14 15% locked in. Not a huge amount, I don’t like to short such cult-following stocks because a lot of the time the fundamentals dont matter
1057 2018-07-26 16:57:36 Yeah, that was brutal for their stocks and Zuckerberg’s net worth
1058 2018-07-26 16:56:56 Coca Cola stocks went up so now they want to knock them down by raising prices.
1059 2018-07-26 16:56:19 Your argument is based on the past. I am making a suggestion of the future. World demand has to either fall +/-20MMT or else 20MMT of EU/BS wheat demand needs to shift elsewhere. Oz forget it, Argie will be part solution. US stocks is what the world has to draw down on. IMO.
1060 2018-07-26 16:56:07 Older folks tend to do that. This is why investment portfolios go from aggressive (stocks) to conservative (mutual funds) as you near retirement.

I suppose that perspective and approach warrants higher speculation in crypto, and for that I don't blame you. #longterm #HODL
1061 2018-07-26 16:56:07 Stocks are trading Mixed, as Facebook disappoints with their Earnings Reports and is dragging the Tech Sector down today, while facing their largest one day decline (thus far, about 19%).  MBS is up 5bps and Yields are hanging around 2.97%.

1064 2018-07-26 16:55:26 Facebook stocks are dropping because young people are not using it, see it as their parents' social media, and are flocking to all the alternatives instead.  It has jack shit to do with angry conservatives.
1065 2018-07-26 16:55:22 The most important factor contributing to returns over the last 12 months has actually been resource stocks. For the year to the end of June the FTSE/JSE Resources 10 Index gained 44.6%.

BHP Billiton was up over 55% during this period, Anglo American gained around 76%, and

1067 2018-07-26 16:55:04 Facebook rattles Nasdaq, but trade optimism boosts Dow: Facebook's plunge sparked a selloff in high-growth stocks that sent the Nasdaq lower on Thursday, but the contagion was contained by optimism after the United States and the European Union said they would negotiate on trade.

1081 2018-07-26 16:50:36 Most people don't understand working capital (even some bankers). But building up stocks takes finance - takes cash. You're basically investing cash in extra stocks that won't be sold for some considerable time. Not good if balance sheet's already stretched.

1100 2018-07-26 16:44:17 If facebook stocks crashes and Zuck loses almost everything. I won't feel bad. Facebook is a cesspool of comments that is over the line of harassment. Instagram no better in folks posting images of smut and other obscene intimate images. UK's The Sun is reporting it.
1101 2018-07-26 16:44:01 So you’re saying that you’re buying a stock with a P/E in the 40s because of what you think/hope will happen in the future?   Nvidia holders feel the same way.  Sorry, Mr. Hickey. Gold stocks are not “dirt cheap”.  And I’ve never seen FCF numbers on this blog to show otherwise.
1102 2018-07-26 16:43:57 Zuck doesn't realize that young people don't do FB because their parents and grandparents are on it. And of the old fogies that are on it at least 1/2 are conservative. And my bet is (tho I can't validate it) is that more conservative own stocks than libs.
1103 2018-07-26 16:43:19 A value investor doesn’t have a new idea for his/her portfolio every week. If you find yourself liking so many different names, then maybe you’re a speculator and not an investor. You probably like the idea of finding stocks more than you like holding them while they do nothing.
1104 2018-07-26 16:42:56 It's highly likely that the ECB/FED lost a lot of money there. A lot of technology stocks are overvalued anyway.

1108 2018-07-26 16:40:40 Why Other Faang Stocks Could Drop ...
1109 2018-07-26 16:40:39 Sell social media stocks and invest in home improvement stocks.
1110 2018-07-26 16:40:26 Stocks are mixed at mid-morning Thursday. Facebook (FB) is down about 20% after a worse-than-expected quarterly report. That has dragged a number of tech stocks lower. At present, the S&P 500 is down 0.08%, the DJIA is up 0.47%, and the NASDAQ is down 1.22%. (CFRA).
1111 2018-07-26 16:40:18 Good day for #UJO but ridiculous evaluation until 0.2p atleast. And as always, it's one of the less hashtagged stocks.
1112 2018-07-26 16:39:42 Congressman Lewis, you're gaslighting us. The tax cuts went toward businesses used to buy back their own stocks. Workers have not benefited; wages stagnant.
1113 2018-07-26 16:39:26 Unfortunately the stock will go up after ER, normally FANG stocks don't blow it twice in row, but i wish a repeat of FB, but it won't happen 
1114 2018-07-26 16:39:06 Everytime I retweet my Conservative friends "Sorry, that tweet has been deleted" pops up...I hope @jack's stocks crash worse than Cuckerberg's

Please try to look into all aspects. ILFS is having a huge value of Real Estate Holdings bought at rock bottom. For once, LIC could actually be making a killing here. It is LIC's investments in RIL or TCS or INFY which are risky as those stocks are overvalued today.

1432 2018-07-26 14:53:07 Mark Zuckerberg already made his money The people who bought stocks and made him rich will never get back their money. Their money is lost, forever.
1433 2018-07-26 14:52:57 lol, yes, because institutional investors and large fund managers who hold most of these stocks are going to make strategic investment decisions based on the ramblings of a has-been actor... that's precisely what happened to FB
1434 2018-07-26 14:52:15 Today #nifty made an all time high around 11185 .So far the best performing Asian market this year.

1435 2018-07-26 14:52:03 Not exactly, the price action so far doesn't fit to most technical indicators. Fundamentally since the value itself is the underlying asset, it is inconsistent with traditional analysis methods. It's behaving more like penny stocks with insider trading .

1439 2018-07-26 14:50:15 $SPY My guess is under the hood some lesser quality stocks are rallying to compensate for $FB fall. Now my thesis is such stocks don´t have the sustain/endurance FB has meaning they rally as easy as they are dumped. Let analysts explain which blue chip heavyweight is up 20% 2day

1442 2018-07-26 14:49:12 Yeah I read something that before the 2008 recession, 75% of Americans had some sort of investment in stocks/bonds. Today, it’s closer to 50%, as people lost confidence and more people just don’t have the money now. 50% of the country missed out on the 10 years of growth
1443 2018-07-26 14:48:10 yea. I get it. but totally ignores that if you own enough the most you can lose in one market/stock is 100% but some markets/stocks will go up well over 100%.

1475 2018-07-26 14:37:44 Thing about high flier NASDAQ mega-cap tech stocks, is that some aren’t really tech stocks anymore.
$FB is basically an advertising co.
$AAPL is basically a consumer discretionary co.
$AMZN after taking share from traditional retail, is now just a big proxy on retail spending.
1476 2018-07-26 14:37:13 the theory is that if huge weights in ETFs blowup they would cause a cascade effect thru all the other stocks as the ETFs / indices have to stay in balance.   Forced selling in FB etc may cause forced selling in smaller mkt cap names that are totally unrelated

1480 2018-07-26 14:36:18 Doug kass has said to short FANG stocks for many years. He's been completely destroyed. And ironically, he COVERED his face book short two days for a massive loss.
1481 2018-07-26 14:36:02 Gonna call BS on "Trade Tariffs" as being the cause. It's really the massive interest rate hikes.  Banksters give themselves a raise (via interest rate hikes) 2stash their cash - as the smart  exits stocks b4 crash from hikes. It's actually f'ing hysterical at this point.

1489 2018-07-26 14:34:52 Facebook stocks nosedive because they tell shareholders they're focused on privacy. They jumped ship because short term quarterly profits are going to decline as a result of this.

1544 2018-07-26 14:16:12 Most of the cannabis stocks are already overvalued. They are valued @ price which holds if a lot more people start consuming weed suddenly.

1545 2018-07-26 14:15:20 The Spot is at $24.50 and stocks are up in limited amounts.  CCJ was up $0.79/sh earlier.  To me this pushes out my timetable. Good news but not great.

1560 2018-07-26 14:10:26 The oil curve is inverted; which people believe means that crude demand will be low/ Supplies high in the future. This hurts E&P stocks as investors are always looking for “growth”. This is silly, you can’t predict the future. The curve indicates that E&Ps are hedging. THATS ALL

1562 2018-07-26 14:09:40 Tracking - but how could i capm apply to cross sectional returns bonds, currencies or commodities?  That is the question in my mind - q^5 makes sense that it would subsume traditional factor models in stocks...but traditional factor models work lots of other places.

1568 2018-07-26 14:06:24 Your point is facile. None of those accept stocks I own. Stocks are not currency and (at this point), neither is $BTC. However, unlike stocks, $BTC holds the potential to be both an asset and a currency.

1686 2018-07-26 13:34:57 (2/4) Obviously, this calculation doesn’t include the impact of currency moves. It doesn't take into account when & at what prices the SNB acquired $FB. And the SNB owns many other stocks, some of which will rise today (The SNB follows an index approach to investing)
1687 2018-07-26 13:34:47 That was lame. People always scream "manipulation"m, when their stocks don't perform. It's a noobie mistake, to argue with the chart, If a hedge fund is hammering you stock down below $10, it's probably for a good reason. It doesn't prove a conspiracy...
1688 2018-07-26 13:34:09 In 1995: do people use e-commerce? Nope. Always in 1995: then should I buy this amazon stocks? Nope

1692 2018-07-26 13:32:43 Hahahahahahahahahahha ... did you see him advising investors to take their money out of UK stocks? Mogg setting up Dublin funds; Odey betting £500Mill against UK Co's ... ALL THE RICH ELITES know what brexshit means to UK economy, just the gullible amoeba think we'll succeed...?!

1695 2018-07-26 13:31:46 I don't use Facebook but I know it's part of a clutch of tech stocks that drive the market. FB decline drags others down.
1696 2018-07-26 13:31:45 If $SPX makes a new high today with what $FB is doing, does that forever kill the “its only a few big stocks” narrative ?
1697 2018-07-26 13:31:34 The risk would be if and when the producer wants to roll to another delivery period and the elevator has to spread to a different option month... with cash the time of delivery is baked into price and the elevator would treat is same as owned stocks - at least that how I see it
1698 2018-07-26 13:30:32 Heh, I remember needing to buy stocks in blocks of 100.
1699 2018-07-26 13:30:10 Folks wanna bet the house on those tech stocks. Good luck.
1700 2018-07-26 13:30:08 I’m not really a fan of maguire tbh. Decent World Cup but that’s it. 65 mill is ridiculous for him but don’t blame Leicester, they don’t want to sell. Maguire might not get an opportunity like this again, has to go and Leicester should sell while stocks high. We shall see ..#mufc

5) $TSLA never worked!
1712 2018-07-26 13:24:51 NASDAQ reopens in a few minutes. Any bets as to how much Facebook will be tanking by? Are we looking at a privacy-driven minicrash of internet stocks?

1722 2018-07-26 13:22:29 The idea is to sell when Volitility is high. Select stocks with high IV Rank which you can find on Traders Lounge Beta site.

1734 2018-07-26 13:17:35 I never heard of MDB.  But there are areas/stocks that are very attractive without the premiums, provide value AND growth. Be opportunistic on weakness. Tech had taken the spotlight and it was worth the ride but you cant be greedy like $FB.

1736 2018-07-26 13:16:52 We have a tactic: sell MOST of your shares into  strength before earnings. We did this on FB. We could sell the rest here and we still have a good profit on our trade. #stocks.
1737 2018-07-26 13:16:20 Armageddon in $FB is either going to turn #stocks into a disaster... or a massive buying opportunity. As long as you know what to look for... All in all, this is going to be fun to watch (from the sidelines of course)... $nflx $amzn $twtr

1787 2018-07-26 12:58:13 I get that, but it's a balancing act. Do we really need to give companies $4000 per $50k so they can buy back their stocks and destroy small businesses? I'm fine with giving them some money, but that much of a tax percentage is insane.

the bottom half. The top five weight has jumped from 10.1% in April 2016 to
14.0% at the end of June, suggesting breadth has narrowed. However, this is still below the 18.2% weight at the major peak in 2000.

1846 2018-07-26 12:31:13 I think we need to focus on Q1 results of companies where share prices have fallen by more than 30-40%, Tata Mot, BEL, KNR Cons, PSU Banks, Metal/Mining stocks etc ... expectations are low ...even if results are marginally better than expectations some of these stocks could fly.

1865 2018-07-26 12:18:58 I'm a little surprised that Facebook earnings aren't dragging down Amazon more. Not because FB's problems map to AMZN (per se) but because the results (I think) show how wrong the market can get these stocks and how easy it is to be blindsided by near-term change.

1876 2018-07-26 12:13:25 Have you got into the details ? EBITDA was inline. Financial income missed by 40pct. 20pct of Marutis PAT comes from Financial other income....

The irony is that ppl give 27x on Marutis PAT of which 20pct is Financial Income...such a shame....

And BTW, Brokers don't own stocks.
1877 2018-07-26 12:13:24 If this doesn't serve as a wake up call to overly complacent investors, analysts, and others, I don't know what will. Especially when you combine it with the fact we've seen massive, easy money-driven inflation in many other asset classes (outside of tech stocks)
1878 2018-07-26 12:12:12 How smart is Trump when it comes to the stock market? In June of 2016 he said we were in a bubble & he sold out all his stocks. The S&P 500 Index was 200 at the time. Today it is 284. He missed a 40%+ move not counting 2%+ of dividends per year. Well a market timer he is not.
1879 2018-07-26 12:11:43 You totally missed my point. In SP500, FAANG stocks make up the same market-cap weight as bottom 282 stocks. That’s why fundamentally-weighted indices are safer.

Also it doesn't help that people can be reported for harmless things, but not incitement of actual crimes.

1891 2018-07-26 12:08:25 It's under performed for 18 years! And getting 3% a year in a secular bull market is a crime. This is why every investor needs to take a good look at their stocks every year and ask "is this still a good investment?"

1904 2018-07-26 12:02:19 The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky, as their prices rise and less risky, as their prices fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks more costly to buy. You should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale
1905 2018-07-26 12:02:18 Also in between Modi & Jaitley introduced 10 per cent tax - LTCG - on stocks. Pls take that also in consideration. U take risk u lose money & in case u make some profit we take a part of it.

1907 2018-07-26 12:01:44 Is that why the stocks dropped? Just really sad and hurtful. One of the most horrific days in our history, and I don't understand these people who cause all of these families so much pain still? Painful.

1913 2018-07-26 11:57:14 Today is a great reminder of why market cap weighted index funds are not as cheap and safe as many think.  Using math and fundamentals to weight stocks is harder, but avoids the market-cap menace.
1914 2018-07-26 11:56:03 I agree with the ppl only freak when stocks have a bad day. I wrote a note last time it dropped in March and again today comparing it to Steph Curry having a bad couple games. It isn't good but imp to remember how HUGE it's been for your returns.

2216 2018-07-26 08:19:59 Great to see two stocks that I like Smart Group and Aristocrat each reach record highs today in a flat market overall. The ASX was down as much as 33 points today. They are examples of characteristics I like in local stocks - mid caps, growing economic moats and few competitors.

2221 2018-07-26 08:16:05 @AaratiKrishnan Maam in your recent @ValueResearch article you said that MidCap funds are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis SmallCap funds as their universe is only 150 stocks & 65% should be invested in them.

2238 2018-07-26 08:01:22 I get it and I do think 7% doesn't qualify as "good". First you can easily get that with boring real estate and a little leverage. Second, if you aim for 7% return stocks you will get a few losers and other misfortunes and end up with <<7%. Think 10% should at least be the target

2245 2018-07-26 07:56:37 Your tweet implied UK farmers replacing imports, which will be "frozen" whilst quotas/ import rights end with "No deal" hence stocks being built up, Irish imports will have the same problems.

2261 2018-07-26 07:41:50 In fairness, NHS Blood have been saying for the past 10 weeks that stores of all types are critically low.

2262 2018-07-26 07:39:53 That is true. Even sensex so high due to few stocks and not all are going up. Was looking at midcap fund returns. Most negative for last year. Anyways have never been fan of them.

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

2555 2018-07-26 04:09:51 So does the Stocks app. Love to play with that when I’m bored.
2556 2018-07-26 04:09:21 You obviously have a F U money and suspect that a lot of it’s not from Entertainment. Just wondering how your portfolio looks? Businesses, stocks, index funds, VC, real estate? Keep on being awesome!
2557 2018-07-26 04:09:15 Grabe akala namin andami na stocks. PUCHA wala pa kami sa kalahati 
2558 2018-07-26 04:08:31 I look at various listings esp new highs, RS  at new high along with volumes (prefer less crowded stocks) . Checkout MEDP , IIIN . Got MEDP options but very thin volume with huge bid/ask and IIIN stocks
2559 2018-07-26 04:08:08 Quite a few stocks of mine are ATH, if only I could have said that for the entire Equity Portfolio.
2560 2018-07-26 04:07:46 Yeah the people in the red states own a lot of stocks from the huge companies in their states 
2561 2018-07-26 04:07:39 I'm looking at my stocks (bc my job gives me shares???) and i'm so confused like they told me to fill out something important and I did???? Adulting ?? ??  ?

2565 2018-07-26 04:04:52 It literally takes about 10 minutes to search for Japanese domestic stocks that pay 3%ish dividends. But there is nobody cold calling you on those.

2568 2018-07-26 04:02:51 The stocks are exactly what the Founders had in mind in prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment in the 8th.

2569 2018-07-26 04:02:03 Today is that day when Nifty touches all time high levels! All the stocks in the portfolio are in green but portfolio is still down by 20% on a YTD basis!  #LifeStandsOnParadox

2572 2018-07-26 03:58:24 Even a point new high and the CNBC guys get so excited and the saddest part is some the stocks that I hold are nowhere even near my buy price 
2573 2018-07-26 03:57:53 Hard to trust crypto related stocks, BTC swings too much and traders punish these stocks, mini pumps only

2578 2018-07-26 03:56:21 @facebook just cratered -24% after-hours (the worst 1-day drop for the company). this is your wake-up call.

while it's unlikely FANG stocks would collectively drop -24% in the same single-day, on any random day they could still experience a collective & chilling drop of ½ that!

2585 2018-07-26 03:52:44 e.g. government that owned all fish in ocean & licensed fishing rights to highest bidder would get way more fish out of it. Present system we overfish. In everyone's interest to let fish stocks recover but any particular person's interest is to fish as much as can.

2610 2018-07-26 03:35:32 What's funny is the only people that maybe--maybe--deserve the stocks are the ones who hint at putting peaceful protestors in the stocks.

2611 2018-07-26 03:35:24 That's something that's been in the back of my mind since I started following stocks a year ago. The staff cut was about 25% of total staff and they are also closing some factories. Profit margin down from 41% to 30%. I think a buyout by Hasbro is more likely though.

2617 2018-07-26 03:30:47 Bulls, I am liking the rollovers for August series. Brace yourself for a smooth expiry. Bullish bias for Nifty.

No one is trying to disarm anyone. Keep your hand guns, revolver, rifles. But there is no logical reason stock pile guns or ammo to have assault weapons, bump stocks or 20+ magazines. Complete background checks and wait periods are necessary

2629 2018-07-26 03:21:12 It is my understanding, that ETF's create shares, and must follow the price of the underlying stocks they hold.  What happens to the underlying, when millions of shares of a major underlying turn into pixie dust?  Could the ETFs LEAD the holdings DOWN??  @jimiuorio
2630 2018-07-26 03:21:03 This has to do with earnings not customers. Investors have driven the so called FANG stocks (FB, Google, Netflix, Amazon) to ridiculous highs. The technology sector as a whole is way overbought, so any bad earnings report will be severely punished.

2670 2018-07-26 03:00:58 I think The uncertainty about being able to turn a profit is the stocks biggest issue. This earnings report is  gonna be a big one. Even if Tesla were to hit hard times, I think a rival company would love to buy them out. Tesla’s are status symbols. There’s a market for that

2677 2018-07-26 02:54:50 Active vs Passive Investing.

I believe that Active investing (picking stocks) can be rewarding as long fees are kept really low and you are constantly researching and learning. Own stocks for years, not trading

If not, stick to index funds with low fees!
2678 2018-07-26 02:53:44 Started leading groups in training and started investing in stocks. It's definitely been a progressive month

Now the criminal in the WH is doing all he can to ruin the good economy passed down to him by our last President.
Petty revenge.
2688 2018-07-26 02:47:11 I look at it this way, they will lose money when their stocks drop because they keep screwing around with conservatives. Facebook found that out real quick. I left FB, I bet others here did as well.

2695 2018-07-26 02:43:29 Seriously @HMNYHQ1 your asking these questions when your stock is at penny stocks levels and your CEO and Board tries to talk investors into funding your burn rate of $20M/month.

2746 2018-07-26 02:25:02 All investment carries higher risk than holding cash no matter your strategy. Also, that cash you sold is absolutely being held by someone. If stocks are overvalued in the short term they might rather hold a nondilutive form of cash over fiat

2757 2018-07-26 02:14:59 We're market skeptics. Historically when NASDAQ index hits record highs, it's usually followed by a market crash. The FANG stocks are the most overvalued of them all, and they drove the index up by themselves. So AMZN, NFLIX... might not last.
2758 2018-07-26 02:14:54 And yet, people talk about less volatility and safety in large caps over mid n small caps..

2787 2018-07-26 02:00:24 @jack stop shadowbanning conservative voices! Facebook stocks have dropped 24% from this censorship (accident). Learn from their mistakes
2788 2018-07-26 02:00:17 JUST IN: 

 Mark Zuckerberg has just lost $150,000,000,000.00 as Facebook stocks dives 20% in under two hours.”

I say, that’s what he gets for trying to censor me and conservative friends. 
2789 2018-07-26 01:58:52 Madam what does Facebook has to do with Indian tech stocks
2790 2018-07-26 01:58:42 You should have a look at the Australian uranium stocks trading right now.  Bannerman is up over 10% and Peninsula is up over 5%.
2791 2018-07-26 01:58:37 FB is one of the most widely held stocks on the planet and many that own it have no idea they do via ETFs.  The unloading on this will be exceptional.
2792 2018-07-26 01:58:28 Does that mean stocks and poker to be a close match? I doubt!

Perhaps 80:20 could be that in poker It's 80% Luck and 20% psychology, wherein in stocks it is vice versa. Infact maybe Luck:Psychology stands at 2:98.

End of the day you've got to have some luck on your side :)
2793 2018-07-26 01:57:55 Many times I have been accused by the people sent from the devil of being paid to tell #TheTruth 
#GOD does not need to pay anyone to tell the truth!
2794 2018-07-26 01:56:33 I generally stay away from talking stocks on this account, but, if security tokens are regulated with similar rules as stocks, figure out how to evaluate a company's growth potential, competitive advantages, risks, and financial health. You'll be ahead of the game.
2795 2018-07-26 01:56:24 dude next to me on this plane is looking at stocks and going "what?! Son of a bitch"
2796 2018-07-26 01:55:52 He said he was selling all his stocks when Trump won. Smart move right there.
2797 2018-07-26 01:53:24 Sweden has a better pollution handle than the USA does, they down cycle some output streams so that the waste products of one industry is the feed stocks of another. Though we can't all be great at that if we don't try, Iceland is trying to get out of fossil fuel use as well.
2798 2018-07-26 01:52:28 should have bought fashion nova stocks
2799 2018-07-26 01:52:22 It was just as crazy then as it is now to buy bitcoin. Much better to build a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds and preserve your wealth instead
2800 2018-07-26 01:52:00 Note to self; buy stocks in almond flour. #glutenisthedevil #highwayrobbery
2801 2018-07-26 01:51:34 to think that Montana Skeptic was presenting a bear case for #tsla because his employer was long some oil stocks is beyond the pale
2802 2018-07-26 01:50:54 Let me know so I can stock up on healthcare insurance stocks again. Thanks Obama for making me rich.
2803 2018-07-26 01:50:48 This is what a real successful security AI company looks like; $OMVS, not so much 
2804 2018-07-26 01:50:35 Plus the usual liquidity constraints etc. Would much rather a factor fund focusing on the top 50 or 100 stocks. Maximum capacity in exchange for potentially lower max alpha.
2805 2018-07-26 01:49:43 lol this is a legendary lesson to learn for new traders. Nothing is guaranteed not even the praised FAANG stocks. Can’t expose your neck like that ever in the mkt.
2806 2018-07-26 01:47:15 Facebook has lost a little over 20%of its stock since the market closed. Wow... Is this the beginning of the end for Facebook? #Stocks
2807 2018-07-26 01:46:49 It's happening for long. Promoters getting their stocks peddled on TV/blogs by famous small cap investors. Now even that cannot restart the show.
2808 2018-07-26 01:46:36 Nabobo ako sa stocks
2809 2018-07-26 01:44:57 Most Americans don’t invest in stocks
2810 2018-07-26 01:44:33 Im seriously curious.... How can the stock market measure in fractions of a penny? #stocks #base #haypenny #bringbackthehaypenny #haypennyrevolution #stockmarket #ticker
2811 2018-07-26 01:44:00 Put some money into some stocks and forgot all about it,just checked and now I got some more money chilling with my old money that was chillin doing nothing

2814 2018-07-26 01:40:50 This is so Biggie and Tupac.  KD and CJ playing everyone.
2815 2018-07-26 01:40:36 Having a stocks account is kinda scary. I just bought the Megaman X Legacy Collection 1 last night. Today my stocks account made $20. This is weird.
2816 2018-07-26 01:40:32 Dividends don’t help a stock appreciate if the company needs capital to grow.  Many funds are unable to buy stocks in companies without a dividend, so merely by starting a dividend it would help Tesla.  A penny a share would be a great start, but only after “free cash flow +”.
2817 2018-07-26 01:40:08 I'm still wondering if @NancyPelosi dumped her stocks when Mark did. Insider info?
2818 2018-07-26 01:39:54 I used to like Nunes too, this year has shown a different side to her, Her Stocks are dropping. Cris vs Nunes should've been booked by now and a Date set
2819 2018-07-26 01:38:35 Damn you are loaded lmao. Stocks huh
2820 2018-07-26 01:37:42 He’s actually a pretty good writer and I’ve never seen a post of his predicting stocks. I’ve seen lots of his posts slamming the Trumpkins and esp the alt-right.  Y’all sure it’s not the latter that bothers you?
2821 2018-07-26 01:37:40 "I fell in love so hard with you today, I dropped so far like Facebook's stocks on the 25th/26th of July."
2822 2018-07-26 01:37:01 wow, crazy to see how @NeinHammer went from bottoming out in singles to being the MVP of the crew battle for Req. He took 5 stocks vs westchester (the 2nd place team)

2824 2018-07-26 01:36:18 If you think you are having a bad day? 
Just remember that Mark Zuckerberg lost $150,000,000,000.00 as Facebook stocks dives 20% in under two hours earlier today.
2825 2018-07-26 01:35:49 Oh yea they run scammed ads all the time I remember clicking on am ad about stocks and lead me to a site that was just trying to identity theft.
2826 2018-07-26 01:33:44 Lowest possible?? Is today your first day trading stocks?
2827 2018-07-26 01:33:24 @TDAmeritrade Just a thought here as a retail trader of options. The algos run 24/7 and as a retail trader I can only trade during market open hours. Yet I can trade stocks 24/7. What is wrong with this picture. I have lost thousands of dollars because of this and it is wrong.
2828 2018-07-26 01:33:10 I legit love talking stocks with my pops. We speak the same language.
2829 2018-07-26 01:32:25 It may be time to start looking at mining stocks, the cycle is on the up. most Goldie’s are on the move.
2830 2018-07-26 01:31:58 Especially in this market but some of these high flying stocks deserve a reality check.
2831 2018-07-26 01:31:48 @JasonBondPicks you mean I can be just like you if I trade penny stocks?........
2832 2018-07-26 01:31:18 I prefer dividend paying stocks (with a long history) as my “safe” investments.  Still have to be cognizant of their situations though. GE’s do happen with high debt and opaque earnings
2833 2018-07-26 01:29:23 Plan b is cheaper online but who the fuck stocks up on it. Put that overnight shipping on it and it’s basically the same over the counter lolol

2839 2018-07-26 01:27:56 I knw you're not a fan of mutual funds. But the capital growth in my IRA and 13  of my individual stocks (mostly tech and/or growth stocks) doesn't equal the capital grown in 5 of my mutual funds
2840 2018-07-26 01:27:50 Stocks will be going up
2841 2018-07-26 01:27:42 Stocks ....lol

2843 2018-07-26 01:26:03 Too funny.  I got banned yesterday from fb (only 24 hours)...and their stocks went spiralling down.

That's what they get for messing with me!!! 
2844 2018-07-26 01:23:11 my tech stocks were up a lot today
2845 2018-07-26 01:22:26 its good long and short term investment, doesnt really matter what amount ,but probably wouldnt invest into stocks without 1k +$
2846 2018-07-26 01:22:01 @jimcramer  Netflix and Facebook have had some very large moves lately. Do you consider the fang stocks to be in a bubble even though they are profitable?

2857 2018-07-26 01:16:17 Genius, Hamish was quoted in the @afr yesterday as saying stocks could fall 30%. And they did! Or $FB did at least...
2858 2018-07-26 01:15:47 Official closing price is the closing price on the primary exchange. Ie. NYSE listed stocks final price on NYSE, not the other 12 exchanges. The NYSE closing price typically reports a few seconds after 4 pm. If there is a huge closing imbalance, NYSE close could be well after 4.

2860 2018-07-26 01:14:56 For when the next recession hits, out of the top tech stocks $MSFT seems to be the strongest and most capable to do "well" through it.
2861 2018-07-26 01:14:39 Hi. It is at 50% off. However, there are only limited stocks left. Thank you,
2862 2018-07-26 01:14:30 Exactly one more time than the maximum number where they remain profitable.

Which might be about one less than this given what just happened to their stocks.
2863 2018-07-26 01:11:55 We need a critical mass of people in order to strike. However, everyone can boycott, take their money out of the bank (Leave only what is necessary short term), sell their stocks, and protest.

Yes or no?  

On the record, Senor Innuendo.

2876 2018-07-26 01:00:59 I’m a patient long time investor but today wasn’t the best. Facebook and Ford absolutely cratered today. It’s appropriate that the 2 biggest losing stocks begin with ‘F’ because there is a F word I want to repeat a lot.
2877 2018-07-26 01:00:04 Sometimes I wish there was a “Send Message” button next to the MM’s on our stock platforms so that I could send them a message that says “HEY FUCK YOU BUDDY.” Just a thought. #Stocks

2879 2018-07-26 00:59:20 I’m buying those Karma stocks, it’s about time that smile was wiped off that arrogant bots face
2880 2018-07-26 00:58:04 Yeah but they are not small errors. The point of journalism is to get the truth out objectively. They completely failed their AR-15 demonstration on how bump stocks work, they did not cover Clinton's e-mails, they covered trump crazily and forgotten that there is other news.
2881 2018-07-26 00:57:28 That's right, keep bragging about how well the Stock Market is doing to the people WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY STOCKS!
2882 2018-07-26 00:56:43 Huge, humongous revenue miss for FB.  Stock may go down 15% from today's high.  And there will be a general bloodbath in tech stocks tomorrow.  Tread with caution. #Facebook #FB

2900 2018-07-26 00:40:14 We consumed the stuff we bought.

They bought stocks and bonds of our corps.
They financed a huge cyber war capability

2903 2018-07-26 00:38:10 AXXA had news though, you know how much penny stocks love the news. Got it on my watch list for now, hit my scanner today. Want to see if a new base forms
2904 2018-07-26 00:38:09 I'm sure they'll still be able to afford that along with all the stocks they're buying back in their own companies.  Gettin' richer every day, don't ya know.

2908 2018-07-26 00:36:14 Have been thinking that all year, about higher risk free rates and impacts on DCFs, leading to shift from “all in the terminal value” stocks like $NFLX and $AMZN to near term high FCF yield stocks. But somehow it hasn’t worked and accelerated the other way so far! Maybe now turn?
2909 2018-07-26 00:36:04 Except I just watched them say on the cnbc stock market channel that Trump's winning the trade war. 
Stocks were up and they said it could hit an all time high
2910 2018-07-26 00:35:57 However they do try to take the guns now don't they? Between all of the staged school shootings, staged Church shootings not to mention the completely forgot about Las Vegas shooting. It's all about bump stocks silencers large-capacity magazines and anything else they can drum up
2911 2018-07-26 00:35:39 I buy stocks on amazon to buy more stuff on amazon. its like i get free stuff on amazon.
2912 2018-07-26 00:35:23 Hey @facebook keep censoring conservatives.  It's doing wonders for your stocks.
2913 2018-07-26 00:34:56 Stocks are forward looking and they missed expectations (part of the stock price is the expectation of future growth not just what they are currently doing, hence the high market cap). The problem is not just the miss on earnings here, but the forecasting of future growth.

2921 2018-07-26 00:29:10 Well done.  I certainly made my share of money from FB, and even some on TWTR, but knew gravy train was ending.  When the momo stocks crack it's breathtaking!  SNAP was a loser from day 1 (OK, day 3;-)
2922 2018-07-26 00:29:07 No. That's a wrong way to look at it. Bitcoin is not just going to replace money , it's going to be 99% SoV and 1% money. That 99% is going to compete with gold, bonds, real estate, stocks etc.
2923 2018-07-26 00:25:48 Good. And as long as they’re promoting Alex Jones and harming democracies, stocks can go straight to Hell with Zuckerberg.
2924 2018-07-26 00:25:22 But suck was able to transfer stocks before this?? That seems unethical and possibly illegal
2925 2018-07-26 00:24:44 The economy hasn't been better in 30 years,  trade deals are getting better,  stocks are up, north Korea hasn't blown anything up in  9 months . who cares what he did 10 years ago.  not me

2927 2018-07-26 00:23:50 A tough night on European exchanges turned strongly positive after the White House announced a preliminary trade deal with the European Union. US stocks rose and bonds are under pressure globally. As the US dollar weakened gold is back above US $1,230 an ounce.@MicMcCarthy_CMC
2928 2018-07-26 00:22:23 Yes no doubt. I own some stocks. On lighter note, FB dating feature news caused Match group stock to go down by double digit. They must be smiling now.
2929 2018-07-26 00:22:05 I see wayyy too many newbies going all-in on Tech / Marijuana stocks. If you want to bet on a sector, thats your call; just be sure to hedge your bets through put options or other means

The name of the game is protecting your capital, while maximizing upside exposure #investing

2934 2018-07-26 00:19:26 Unless Amazon crushes her earnings tomorrow....Look for Dow stocks to outperform.....Just my opinion.
2935 2018-07-26 00:18:20 I didn't say it was wrong! It's brilliant! At the end of the day talking about discussed stocks is how you get to be in front of the masses and that's ok as you do a good job pn the whole - but in fairness there can be some mismatch in some reports v what is recom to subscribers
2936 2018-07-26 00:16:49 How much is Mark Zuckerberg going to shed in the stock tomorrow if it does open at where it is right now? #stocks #FB

2940 2018-07-26 00:13:41 Theoretically your money should@slowly shift to more conservative investments (more cash and bonds, less stocks) as you age. Less risk, less reward, more stability

2946 2018-07-26 00:10:46 If you depend on stock prices, it is wise to think about who buys those stocks and keep your political opinions to a minimum if you need millions of customers
2947 2018-07-26 00:10:46 Anyway with these secular growth stocks you can't get too caught up in catching the bottom tick. I think buying at $175 and below should be fine, although I think a clear case can be made for decline to $150 and even lower.

2956 2018-07-26 00:05:48 You have #2A in your bio yet you support Hawley, who wants to ban bump stocks. Petersen, on the other hand, is literally raffling off a 3D printer that prints guns. Who’s the REAL #2A candidate in the race?

2960 2018-07-26 00:04:59 I'm sure their Stocks would do better after a few months of telling everyone that "facebook" can help America to know who's Stalking them, Stalkers can feel the need to invest in fbook stocks, instead of spending so much of their time going out to Stalk.
