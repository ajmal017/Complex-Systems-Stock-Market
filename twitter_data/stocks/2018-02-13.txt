5 2018-02-13 23:53:55 Hope you all know this is what these guys want so they can buy in cheap; the old guys with stocks missed the boat on crypto, now they are FUDing the hell out of it to drop the price so they can buy. Don't fall for the BS.

11 2018-02-13 23:51:38 Why choose real estate over stocks?

Real estate investments offer an alternative to the stock market and with the right properties they are lower risk, yield better returns and is something concrete that you can control by hiring good managment.

42 2018-02-13 23:42:35 I have no defense for multiple semi auto weapons. But suppressors for competitive shooters for ear protection for both shooter and spectator. Also suppressors as a courtesy to other hunters in the woods. Bump stocks I am not aware of the practical use.

49 2018-02-13 23:35:34 4 signs the market is balanced: 1.) The #stockmarket is now paying attention to the bond market & the sharp rise in yields. 2.)

52 2018-02-13 23:33:39 I appreciate that. Personal protection is a valid reason for gun ownership. But, there's a line, no? A person wouldn't need 1,000 rounds of ammo, or multiple semi-automatic weapons, or modifiers like bump stocks or suppressors for personal protection. Now where that line is--

72 2018-02-13 23:21:19 I disagree. A soft CPI will be ‘wait and see’ which is good for stocks. A strong inflation number surpassing expectations would reaffirm the case for higher rates (ie 4 hikes). The 10yr in this case will continue the march toward 3+. Bad for stocks in the short term at a minimum.
73 2018-02-13 23:21:10 Why do you lie? You are just as bad as #FakePresident. 12% are benefiting from tax bill. These bonuses are nothing but a one time "OK" and then what? CEOs have already said they will invest back to shares and stocks dividends. Remember 345 million Americans and 12 %.

Is the data for the interruption timeframe ( e.g. Europe pre/post WWII) based on pure stock portfolios or a mixed stock/ bond / cash position of an average inbvestor ?
Cash would have been a desaster but stocks should have done quiet well, isn´t it?

94 2018-02-13 23:06:19 Looking at CAPE historically I honestly don’t know what it measures. For example in 2011 you could easily say that it was high - and yet stocks skyrocketed afterwards. Need to look at the calculation to gain some insight.

109 2018-02-13 22:56:21 In learning how to value stocks, there is a certain degree of irony that the margin of safety principle introduces into valuation's actual application:

115 2018-02-13 22:53:29 Just cuz the market "dropped 1500" doesnt mean its THE time to buy. In fact its a moment for pause, this market hasnt experienced volatility in a few years.

High print; and we may re-try the 3% goal.. Higher rates, lower equities, higher USD is what many will watch

A few players want a "V" correction on stocks.. the "see, I told you. US rates can do 4%.. fed may hike 5 times" camp

139 2018-02-13 22:41:10 It's less that Bayonetta is ridiculous compared to the rest of the cast, it's more that her design philosophy feels different. People hate how quickly their stocks can evaporate in a usually pretty "tame" punish game. Her counter is undeniably poorly made, if she counters any hit
140 2018-02-13 22:41:05 Sort of indifferent as to whether stocks go up or down, but I'm starting to miss all the fun
141 2018-02-13 22:40:26 Greed kinda like penny stocks. If the can make 5 cents on each taxpayer scam by scam they are richer
142 2018-02-13 22:40:03 I can give you a few runs through stocks if you want. Should help.

145 2018-02-13 22:35:36 Greed for easy return will drive this fledgling industry forwards. Some coins need to go to zero, they are not needed. ICO's in the future is where speculation akin to stocks will take place, but we need mass adoption before then. The basic building blocks need foundation stones.

158 2018-02-13 22:27:14 World stocks mixed: US +.3%; Europe -.6%. Buyers & sellers battled to essentially a tie. The market is at an inflection point & that signals lots of short-term volatility. Long-term still looks good for single-digit 2018 returns for those that stay the course.
159 2018-02-13 22:26:49 You know that moment when you seached through all social media played a game on your phone and then debate wether you should open up stocks on your phone cuz you got nothing better to do cuz you finished your test in class

187 2018-02-13 22:07:20 Watch this Company. There fund charges are hidden. If you look at the portfolio of any fund i.e. which actual shares it is invested in say circe 80% most stocks are large blue chip companies Only10% oils, gold, far east, european or flavour of the day.
188 2018-02-13 22:06:19 I am sure she is talking about day and swing trading stocks. and not long term investing. Although the same can apply to crypto also.
189 2018-02-13 22:06:14 Maybe a national database? Violent misdemeanors? No one on no fly lists? Regulate *all* private sales with background checks nationwide? And I don't care if Obama was potus when bump stocks were made legal. They shouldn't be.

195 2018-02-13 22:01:54 Looks like a hatchery release site.  Where local genetic stocks are hatched ashore and released to the wild ecosystem to eat wild food & grow alongside wild fish and be sustainably harvested.  Entirely unlike a fish farm.  Or is it something else in the picture?

198 2018-02-13 21:59:56 And with a lot of stocks beaten down, I think it's good play with ER right now. If good, should go up where many times sells off with stocks so high in heated market.

204 2018-02-13 21:57:30 Hi Edward, it's a good strategy if done infrequently and tactically in my opinion. If always buying puts against stocks you own it can be a nasty drag on performance. also consider put spreads or collars to reduce premium outlay and decay.

211 2018-02-13 21:53:45 I recommend nobody ever get into stocks cause come tax season you gotta literally input every trade you've done last year. This has me dead because I literally did over 300+ and I have to do this manually on this form or wait until next Monday to get it done free
212 2018-02-13 21:52:34 @ZachScheidt why is it anytime I find a stock that I want to look up I have to buy someone else's new sheet in order to get it I thought you were getting us the best deals on stocks
213 2018-02-13 21:52:17 I don’t think that necessarily means Wall Street will be “done,” but I do think it means that Wall Street will change. 

In other words, the tokenization (not the elimination) of stocks.

Imagine 1:1 Airdrop of “$APPL Coin” for Shareholders.

Sounds crazy now, but a possibility.
214 2018-02-13 21:52:04 I agree. Bump stocks look cool and work so well
215 2018-02-13 21:51:18 I'm so jelly

229 2018-02-13 21:46:34 Neither are stock prices. Stocks priced in the hundreds against the dollar are very inflationary. Dollar not worth as much as in 1900. But look at what companies gave us in return. Trains, planes, automobiles...

245 2018-02-13 21:37:47 No.  I don't think unilateral value of that stock is the objective function of a non-trivial fraction of people who have control stocks.  Either they are interested in broader performance of the markets or in things way beyond stock market value or both.

265 2018-02-13 21:25:07 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-12, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
266 2018-02-13 21:24:59 Big defense stocks flying higher on  generous new defense budget. Looks like we are preparing for a war with #NorthKorea. Check out the rallies in #NOC, #LMT and #RTN, all holding up better than the rest of the market after the recent correction. See also ITA sector tracking ETF.

278 2018-02-13 21:19:34 An initial stop is a must in my view. It is also possible to stay in trades for years using stops, you just need to define terms and decide on you time frame. Agree Minervini trader style difficult to replicate in UK market on all but most liquid stocks.

287 2018-02-13 21:13:47 Given REIT structure, hard to make the numbers work for mall stocks to de-lever enough to ultimately avoid BK. Rents are only going lower and vacancy hasn't picked up (as I had expected it to). If they could legally route dividend payouts to debt paydown, I'd be more interested.
288 2018-02-13 21:13:15 ...however, using broad strokes, we can see that the wealthy (these wealthy anyway) do not have a huge concentration of assets in publicly traded stocks and bonds.  I like to think of a portfolio as a ship moving through the ocean.  If you only have a small single-purpose vessel
289 2018-02-13 21:13:10 In learning how to value stocks, there is a certain degree of irony that the margin of safety principle introduces into valuation's actual application:

We're not so much looking for what a stock is worth as much as what it isn't.

299 2018-02-13 21:07:32 Right now seems to big volume buys and then low volume falls so what your saying seems correct. Moves but not recovery. But then again we should have a lower leg down in EVERYTHING. Bonds, Stocks, cryptos ect maybe even gold.
300 2018-02-13 21:07:27 It's only truly lost if you sell at a lower price. For these people the loss is only on paper. It means nothing to them. Those who are really hurting are retirees and parents with kids in college who make periodic sales and may have to have the money before the stocks rebound.

314 2018-02-13 21:02:29 Why is it so difficult to make money from speculating (stocks, real estate, bitcoin, etc)? You have to buy BEFORE the hype. If you buy AFTER the hype, it's too late. Speculating successfully requires that you are clairvoyant in some ways. :-)

322 2018-02-13 20:59:11 I'll add that quantitative testing finds adding a value constraint to a system of buying momentum stocks improves consistency. It helps to avoid the extreme overbought/overvalued stocks (biggest winners) so it can smooth the equity curve/reduce drawdown.

383 2018-02-13 20:22:59 There is 200 trillion dollars currently tied up in stocks, cash, bonds and gold..... If Crypto even captures 1% of that value, that brings us to a 2 trillion market cap.

496 2018-02-13 19:18:23 The markets are collapsing. The system is broke. If Fed has to choose between supporting bond bubble or stocks, it will choose bonds. In a debt-saturated world such as today, if stocks collapse, investors and Wall Street are pissed. If bonds collapse, entire countries go bust.

498 2018-02-13 19:18:05 A bad (high) CPI will probably spook stocks and bonds, sending both down.  Keep in mind oil has dropped below $60/bbl.  Early surveys suggest those who received "Trump bonuses" from tax reduction are paying down debt rather than going on spending sprees.  That's not inflationary.

555 2018-02-13 18:45:23 C’mon peter. You know better. It’s all about preservation of capital. The real bubble is in GOVT BONDS. Capital will flee to private assets, including stocks and gold, as well as corporate bonds in some cases.
556 2018-02-13 18:45:13 No. It appears to be you that refuses to see, or is ignorant of economics. On a micro level, who owns “stocks” (as you put it)? And what happens to the value of stocks when there is demand (rich ppl buying)? Answer those 2 questions and I’ll move you to the next phase.
557 2018-02-13 18:45:01 If you want my opinion, you should look to take a position (or add to your holdings) in precious metal stocks. They continue to lag gold prices #tuesdaytips #preciousmetals #stocks #ideas #investments

564 2018-02-13 18:39:37 I don't pay attention to P/E on my individual stocks since my focus in on high EPS growth and high momentum. Adding a P/E filter simply removes most of them - including the biggest winners. High relative/absolute momentum is often positively correlated with high beta and P/E.
565 2018-02-13 18:39:05 Stocks going up, a great time to watch the magic.
566 2018-02-13 18:38:56 #StockMarket  Somethings to keep in mind. Can your survive in any mutual or index fund during a market crash if investors in mostl funds are heading for the exits? Would you fare any better if your held stocks, bonds, etc. outside a mutual or index fund and only you didn't panic?

2) Fully informed but Sociopathic

576 2018-02-13 18:34:48 It "can" matter with individual stocks, as I've observed/tested, but a high P/E will keep you out of the biggest growth leaders as high P/E necessarily implies big optimism of the company and it's earnings, etc. and they tend to stay high.

666 2018-02-13 17:46:48 The heroin epidemic is about to go from bad to horrific within 3-5 yrs. The govt will have to legalize marijuana just to pay for the war on heroin. Time to load up on weed stocks I suppose.

669 2018-02-13 17:45:47 It’s been tried a couple times and FAILED!  The rich are just investing in stocks. Your government is cutting funds for Medicare and a disability and Social Security to pay for the tax cuts. You really need an education.

676 2018-02-13 17:40:47 Gambling is a sin. Yen yen yen. 

Elites can invest in stocks. Isn't that a form of gambling? 

An attempt to ensure the WORKING CLASS only earn through HARDWORK.

See, some issues in the scriptures aren't outright SIN but carefully inserted to maintain Zero Sum WORLD ORDER.

When a gun man shows up, it's a bit late to sign a petition to ban bump stocks.  Hide if you can, or fight

701 2018-02-13 17:27:36 Would you support a national VAT and/or a financial transaction tax on stocks, etc. to pay down the national debt?
702 2018-02-13 17:26:24 $TSLA in a flat market target stocks with high short interest for huge upside squeeze. 325. This baby held that key 295 and what a bounce. Elon forecasting profitability in Q3. If 325 crosses I think we could see a superspike to 347.50 and 360 as it's done all 3 previous times
703 2018-02-13 17:26:22 Several months of overconfidence bid the market up too high, too fast and as a result a lot of stocks were overvalued, so there was a sell off/correction.
Similar thing happened in late December 2015, but wasn't as big.
704 2018-02-13 17:25:30 A Wall Street speculators pay no tax on their share of a yearly turnover of over $5 quadrillion (5,000 trillion dollars) in stocks, bonds and derivatives. A 1% tax on this turnover, equally divided between the federal and state governments, largely solves the budget deficit.
705 2018-02-13 17:25:01 just noticing how they never discuss stocks being too expensive.  not a regular viewer, but seems like lopsided commentary  "we buy everyday"   "big QQQ calll buyers"

711 2018-02-13 17:22:55 IF US CPI is under 1.8%, US stocks might have massive recovery, but if it is over, the game will be over for the bullside completely
712 2018-02-13 17:22:43 #InterestRates and #inflation need to be much higher on an absolute level before they substantially raise the prospects of an economic #recession in the US and a decline in corporate fundamentals that can spark a decline in equity valuations-Alger #stocks
713 2018-02-13 17:22:41 that 14% is basically the cost of owning a deep otm equity put.  if the market priced ff at 100% then you get a free option.   but that's not necessarily related to this cpi print but fact fed won't hike if stocks drop 50% tmw
714 2018-02-13 17:22:34 My situations different tho..i also get profit sharing which is matched dollar for dollar..so i can afford to be conservative on my 401k until im 40 and extremely aggressive in my stocks

723 2018-02-13 17:17:53 even housing rental REITs falling...IDK, but people gotta live somewhere. It makes no sense to me for the homebuilders' stocks to continue going higher either, lumber at historical highs, etc. Something is not right...

But with Bayo this time it's a lot more toxic with less actual discussion or debate
738 2018-02-13 17:08:06 Whats your email @Papa_Stocks
739 2018-02-13 17:08:05 Always feel it’s a futile discussion. Who knows the value of a business. It’s only perception based which keeps on changing. Otherwise it’s all theoretical. Stocks March up over longer time frame as long as the business is making good money
740 2018-02-13 17:07:58 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $BAC, $GE, $UA, $AMD, and $MU.

783 2018-02-13 16:44:29 The banks already have it in their T&C’s that you cannot use a credit card for speculative purposes (stocks/shares/etc). Coinbase control the type of transaction so I’d assume an agreement was made between all, but yes coinbase should have advised customers before it changed.
784 2018-02-13 16:43:33 I'd say the wider market doesn't often look at data, they look at sales, revenue and the like, so I wouldn't read too much into stocks immediately following. I have shares in both, but your bias is very obvious!

786 2018-02-13 16:42:41 Many financial institutions have restricted stocks of what they allow you buy or even minimum holding periods.  These limitations aren’t violating anyone’s rights since you aren’t forced to work for these companies. Let’s not create a problem where a problem doesn’t exist.

847 2018-02-13 16:09:54 When you trade small cap stocks - especially ones with small float, the prices can be easily affected by one or two big buy/sell orders. So stay calm when prices fluctuate violently all of a sudden, don't get shaken out of the positions.

929 2018-02-13 15:33:16 LOL fake President. Hmm, companies are staying and coming back to America because of the economy, stocks are still way up from before Trump got in to office, unemployment for everyone is super low, tax cuts gave people and companies more money.  Yeah, sounds fake to me.  Idiot.

941 2018-02-13 15:28:52 #stocks If you're a 20 something you should be holding the highest divdend paying stocks with a solid 75 to 100 years of payouts in a 401K or Roth IRA. Assuming you're 40 or more yrs away from retirement, you should keep buying these stocks on dips as cheaply as you can.

1069 2018-02-13 14:27:32 Someone just wrote a comment that this week will be day traders dream and the most volatile ever! Well to me that is the definition of being out of sync with the markets.

1102 2018-02-13 14:09:58  I agree that they'll delay a 180 as long as possible (Mester confirmed this morning that stocks have to go a lot lower first) but I don't believe they have any choice ultimately. They may sacrifice the $ ST as an offset to these tighter money policies.

1382 2018-02-13 10:29:09 In my experience, stocks with strong growth in Earnings may face the heat in a general market correction but they are usually less corrected and would be the quickest ones to bounce off as long as Earning growth is sustained.

1398 2018-02-13 10:08:27 Positive correlation = move up/down together.  Negative correlation = opposite directions.  We don't want BTC and stocks to dip/correct at the same time, so it's nice to see that when one dips, correlation turns negative.

Elle a été exonérée d'ISF. Pour elle, le choix a été très vite fait : je me gave et vous, vous vous serrez la ceinture
1416 2018-02-13 09:38:09 Exactly and gave a few examples that everyone knows "like Litecoin or Ripple". Dude, there are hundreds of coins better than BTC - you have no idea what you are talking about. Go back to stocks because you are way over your head in this
1417 2018-02-13 09:37:15 I dont get it, its the greed, the moon shit, money , money , money , no patience from guys like you. Whats your contribution to cryptocurrencys? You want fast profits, thats all.  Buy stocks, if that is the only usecase of cryptos for you. Or gamble in a casino.
1418 2018-02-13 09:32:36 Why are you lying? I thought stocks are hot in Trump economy.HAHAHA!!!
1419 2018-02-13 09:32:09 people, i am NOT a preacher, but I do know the diff./ between right n WRONG! Trump is a F-in LIE. So, the stock market has gone up, how many of you have stocks ?. ok, you wage went up- big deal, U will pay more in taxes! wake up plz. U all need 2 realize that WE R in the S-can
1420 2018-02-13 09:31:39 Why not just buy and sell pot directly to consumers. I mean returns are way better and you are in control of the whole operation. There is labor involved but its minimal. Why invest in a weed company when you can invest in your own . But yes I also bought the damn stocks.

1423 2018-02-13 09:28:36 Strange. When I offer exactly this service every time I walk past a shop that stocks it, no one is interested. They’re all like “put the pen down or I’m calling the police”.

1462 2018-02-13 08:36:54 The marketplace of ideas sure is overdue for a correction. Some really garbage stocks have been trading far above their value for a long time.

1475 2018-02-13 08:20:18 European stocks mostly a little lower to start the day A minor dip in European stocks as we get things going
Slightly softer tone as investors look to be more cautious in early trading so far. The S&P 500 futures are also lingering near the lows of the day, so it's not time …
1476 2018-02-13 08:20:11 Sure does look that way and there is definitely a good fundamental case for being long commodities given $ moves of year past. However, could we not see stocks drop while commodities stay flat in $-terms? This would adjust the ratio too.

1497 2018-02-13 07:57:43 I assume you bought stocks in the last 4 years and think you’re a pro? All shit rises in a bull market and everything rises with inflation. Unless you’re beating the market you’re nothing special. I can say I am, I won’t presume to know what you’re doing but I’ll guess
1498 2018-02-13 07:55:24 The way to stimulate the economy would be to give a stimulus to the bottom half of society.they. will spend  100 to 110% of their income. Stimulus to the top will only maybe spend  5% and invest in a private stocks over seas.trickle down is a complete scam.never been proven.

1500 2018-02-13 07:54:09 Best to choose great stocks and stay long. If you don't understand what's going on best to do nothing. The market has always gone higher after every correction or crash
1501 2018-02-13 07:53:29 My bet is it's based on rates. Given that it turned in '07 right around when LIBOR spiked, my bet would be somekind of spread based on money market/eurodollar funding. When liquidity/money dries up usually bad things happen to stocks. But I'm curious as well what it is.

1503 2018-02-13 07:52:29 I’m guessing most presidents can make that claim. It’s called a trend, the trend is (unless you’re presiding over some really turbulent times) employment, standard of living and stocks rise. The fact is, Trump (and his followers) actually believe he’s influencing it!!!!

1535 2018-02-13 07:22:34 USDJPY has gone to a new low and a new level of bizarre. Stocks and yields are higher. But because stocks have rallied the market believes yields can or will fall taking USD lower. In short, the USD has inverted as a risk vehicle.

1543 2018-02-13 07:17:24 A low volatility PF delivers a far superior long term return than investing in high volatility circuit-2-circuit stocks. And BTW - this low volatility PF even lets you sleep well. Higher returns come with lower risk, period.

1556 2018-02-13 07:12:20 House prices, just like the values of stocks and shares that underpin nearly all pension funds, ruse and fall. So it's a gamble either way. Plus most people, after paying off their 25yr mortgages don't have enough spare funds to put aside for private pensions.

1679 2018-02-13 05:06:38 Yeah definitely true but that’s still the same as stocks. Buying amazon, apple or Microsoft at anytime during the dot com bubble would still be an excellent investment today as long as you didn’t sodl.

1699 2018-02-13 04:40:25 of course Trump sold ALL of his stocks which was a BIG loss, forego-ed his salary for a BIG loss, and donated MILLIONS, and divested himself of all of his companies by transferring that wealth to his kids.

1712 2018-02-13 04:21:32 Years of doing it myself, starting in daytrading of stocks.  Then I got into Forex and that's where my learning accelerated.  In University I spent a total of a year working for a large bank and received a lot of exposure on their trading floor, but that was a long time ago.

1714 2018-02-13 04:21:04 That's what happens! When a common man starts thinking to put money in the markets - of course looking at everyday rising stocks, it's the actual time to exit!
1715 2018-02-13 04:17:16 Perfect! Anyone who buys stocks on others recommendation and then blames for any fall is either naive or shirks his own responsibility.

1717 2018-02-13 04:14:49 If I bought a stock taking a recommendation on a TV show, a book or a blog

It still is solely my responsibility. I own the decision.

Others are free to market their stocks. I chose to ignore them. Or buy them. If one can’t  take responsibility, then he must not buy stocks.

Bro it's ur money if u are satisfied with 50% profits then u exit. In 6 quarters itself both the names have ability to give u more than 50% returns... Take ur call
1728 2018-02-13 04:05:38 Yep yep. My favorite thing about the "tax cut" is over 80% of it is being used to buy back stocks, which are majority owned by the top 10%. Middle class what?

1740 2018-02-13 03:55:47 Can he legally do this? This money wasn't supposed to be touched. SSI is all a lot of people have, they are not privileged enough to have 401k's stocks or bonds. Why can't you guys impeach him? I am sure that there are some Republicans that want him out. It is theft, in my eyes
1741 2018-02-13 03:55:12 Reinstate regulations that are necessary for our environment and safety. Investigate NRA. Ban bump stocks. Those Trumpers are crazy!!!
1742 2018-02-13 03:54:34 Steph Branch of the SBL averages two stocks (steals plus blocks) a game, has a 15.0 TRB%, which is extremely impressive for a 6'3'' guard, and is long and athletic. If he can figure out his handle, court vision, and shot, the Lakers could have something here.
1743 2018-02-13 03:53:54 I plan for 3 yrs minimum. But remain flexible, as everything depends on valuations, growth prospects.

Some stocks, I am holding for almost 15 years. And some I might get out in 15 days too, if I realize I have made a mistake or if some event occurs.
1744 2018-02-13 03:52:55 I plan to buy more good stocks.
1745 2018-02-13 03:51:49 Very good piece of advise for kids and grown ups alike. I see many people complaining about government policies while they can benefit more by focusing on picking right stocks. LTCG initiated discount sales was an example - many debated very few profited !!!

1788 2018-02-13 03:10:55 Rarely do I disagree with you, but to make this forecast there must be a good answer as to why dollar has sunk till last 2 weeks. While treasuries & dollar may rally hard near term, espec if stocks sell off, in 2 yrs trsry yields HIGHER, $ lower.
1789 2018-02-13 03:08:37 The reason "bump stock" legislation has been kicked to ATF is because original, hastily drafted bill included ambiguous language that would lead to potentially banning of most guns, not just bump stocks.

1797 2018-02-13 03:00:15 What a poor comment. Overlooks some of the hospitality stocks are 2-5x in few months, lazes away from reading even an AR, shies away from even finding out, paints every co in same situation. Overlooks change

1800 2018-02-13 02:57:29 It really does not matter to a great extent which stocks or coins you follow and trade, as long as you follow them closely - The ones you study the most will yield the best results since you will have a good feel for the ebb and flow. #chedsblog

1802 2018-02-13 02:56:29 VIX is implied Volatility. There is also an implied correlation. It’s just a measure of  how much stocks move together. Higher correlation equals lower diversification. Correlation tends to rise in selloffs (which is why you can ‘t truly diversify stocks with other stocks).

1810 2018-02-13 02:53:28 You can do a lot in your TFSA instead of keeping it as cash or bonds, barely staying above inflation. You can invest in $AAPL or other US/CAN stocks, put physical gold in it, play stock options (very risky!), bet on Bitcoin with GBTC... If you make great gains, they are tax free!

1824 2018-02-13 02:42:43 I had a friend who was a genius with finance, stocks and bonds, etc. He gave it all up to open a bike shop.
1825 2018-02-13 02:42:42 Got into penny stocks five or six years ago.  Lost about 20k doing it.  The whole time people on the forums would say stop wasting your time in these things and buy bitcoin.  Almost did but it was more difficult back then so I didn't.  If i did i would have 500 to 1000 worth.
1826 2018-02-13 02:41:51 I'm up 136% on Lithium Americas at the moment. Was up over 200% at its peak a month or so ago. I am confident I will at least triple my money before the year is over on most, if not all, of my current stocks, including $AUZ.

1830 2018-02-13 02:37:38 You're right; it is my friend, which is why I'm up 36% on my stocks right now as a whole, despite the recent pullback in lithium and cobalt stocks, while you're up in here bitching about a stock you don't even own. Clown.
1831 2018-02-13 02:34:30 So buy pot stocks when the nations most powerful law enforcement figure is actively trying to mess it up?  I’d say the right time is when there is some progress on laws.

1838 2018-02-13 02:27:49 All I’m saying is, all you first time investors are so confident in penny stocks. Which to me is crazy. Your portfolio should have 30% btc. 30%eth 20%Neo 10-20% ALt coins. Be smart and do research on your high risk coins.

1862 2018-02-13 02:10:45 Higher stock prices mean nothing. It's only paper. Ppl only gain when they sell. The vast majority of ppl in US don't own stocks anyway. What Rs claimed (what they always claim, & what is never true) is that cos would pass their savings along to employees. That's not happening.
1863 2018-02-13 02:10:36 All about perception and the fact that Bond yields have risen from 2.05% to 2.89% in just a few months while stocks just got hammered 10% in 2 weeks suggests that even if this is the case, all eyes are on the Fed.

1906 2018-02-13 01:39:11 Hell no, stocks will be good in winter so could go with 20s-22s for summer
1907 2018-02-13 01:38:32 It is  a good observation. I noticed that during the two recent big down days cons discr stocks were going down less than many cons staples stocks.

1926 2018-02-13 01:25:54 The PSEi failed to hold above the 8,500 level, and now looks to test its 61.8% retracement at 8,440, as well as the 8,400 level. It will likely rebound from these supports today after US stocks surged before the release of Wednesday’s inflation data.

1932 2018-02-13 01:23:37 I didn’t follow the logic of today’s podcast, why would an investor in a short vix position be encouraged to sell stocks when the market is going down?
1933 2018-02-13 01:22:00 Its happened with some other stocks I've owned, most recently UNH and FDX. The stocks usually bounce back but it can take few days or weeks. Not sure how much of a threat AMZN can be to NVDA though.

1944 2018-02-13 01:13:33 >#2A & starting a civil war. Fully automatic weapons are already heavily restricted (again, with little evidence to suggest it's necessary).

As to legal uses—bump stocks get used to dump large amounts of money on shooting junk, suppressors for managing noise pollution & home >
1945 2018-02-13 01:12:03 @CoinMarketCap when $Bins listed on CMC?? this $Bins already on tidex and stocks exchange.
1946 2018-02-13 01:10:39 Ugh… no military on the planet uses (nor would use) bump stocks—they're nothing more than a stupid toy.

There's no reason to restrict suppressors—if criminals wanted them, they could (& would) make them out of oil filters.

You can't restrict semi-auto handguns w/o repealing >

1963 2018-02-13 00:55:18 These tips have been getting really weird. The “set stop losses on your stocks” was also really weird. Unfollowing so that my head doesn’t explode trying to figure these out anymore.

1965 2018-02-13 00:53:43 You still don't get my argument. I'm not advocating hodling forever! If you spend your crypto it WILL NOT lose value, only if the person that gets it sells it for another store of value. But you can't SPEND stocks.
1966 2018-02-13 00:53:07 Stocks are recovering quickly from a double-digit plunge, and some investors wonder if the gains are too swift.
1967 2018-02-13 00:51:27 Poor guy in the photo was probably sipping tea and checking his stocks when he found out he was on the internet for this.
1968 2018-02-13 00:50:24 I guess I don't see how having opinions on firearms is a violation of his oath. 
For example, I find continued legalization of "bump stocks" to be pure lunacy, and can't for the life of me see how accoutrements as such are protected by 2A. Does this mean that I'm in violation?
1969 2018-02-13 00:46:56 Not much difference when you're talking stocks at this level, ended today 1386. If you sold at 1350 and made $, it's not a bad thing.

1972 2018-02-13 00:45:46 This is not at all true. Assad always says this to his followers 'If you buy stocks that I mention here, it's a ticket to centrelink'. 
He always looks after his clients through a separate handle & has made them loads of money. 
Please stop this false propaganda !!
1973 2018-02-13 00:43:56 As a person knowledgeable of both stocks and crypto, this is very wrong. I’d bet you are either clueless re stocks or trying to spread misinformation for your own gain. On average US stocks pay a dividend equal to 2% of market value. Doesn’t sound like a lot but is of done right.
1974 2018-02-13 00:42:12 All of these trades depended on low vol.  Low vol gave mom & pop the confidence to flood index ETFs with cash....stocks never go down!
1975 2018-02-13 00:42:05 So @Ally convinced me to keep my stock account open saying my issues (including  $100 req purchases), were due to the 5 letter codes or foreign stocks. That was a lie, tried to butly a couple USA stocks that req a min $100 purchase or the stock was worth too little. #closing
1976 2018-02-13 00:41:37 You can always become a short seller or buy an inverse S&P 500 ETF if you run out of stocks, but those are really terrible ideas for long-term investors. Gold and government bonds are much better investments for stock bears.

1983 2018-02-13 00:34:14 Really depends on how many you already have sold. If you don't have many sold I'd be moving some. We're down to gambling stocks so going to wait a while.

1997 2018-02-13 00:19:04 Asian stocks gained Mondayy, after U.S. stocks gained on Friday and S&P 500 Index futures surged in Asia trading hours. May extend gains today
1998 2018-02-13 00:18:41 Stocks have no utility. Few companies pay dividends and few people have enough shares to have a vote. So they are just an investment. But you have to exit it at one point. So it's a game of hot potato. Cryptocurrency is useful. It can circulate forever without losing value.
