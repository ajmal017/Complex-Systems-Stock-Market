6 2018-09-02 23:50:04 Does the thought of spending money on #marketing and #advertising make you nervous?  Think of it as an investment rather than an expense. Done right, it makes you more money in the long-term game, sort of like investing in stocks or property. The pay off will come over time!

13 2018-09-02 23:38:34 Well the stock has risen exponentially since then for whatever reason but we should pick stocks that are under $25 a share that would go up from there anything much higher than that is unfathomable for the average worker

You want a decent return then stick with index funds, mutual funds and ETF's.  Do your own homework & never rely on a broker.

I'll *settle* for the orange guy in an orange suit for at least 8 years (as long as a legitimate president can serve), with all his assets seized.
62 2018-09-02 23:13:40 Global trade fears affected risk appetite last week, strengthening the #USD against most majors. The AUD was hardest hit amongst continuing trade tensions. Surprisingly, macro risk sentiment did little to US stocks, which will trade quietly due to the Labor Day holiday.

72 2018-09-02 22:58:32 Socio-economic issues would be best served by getting the stocks back to a healthy state as quickly as possible.
73 2018-09-02 22:57:07 Only productivity creates prosperity, never regulations or redistribution. 
Nobody "hoardes" wealth. Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy.

75 2018-09-02 22:56:16 Because public stocks already IPOed. Crazy rapid valuations occur for fast growing start ups mostly.
76 2018-09-02 22:48:26 If he really wanted the stock to skyrocket then he would not be charging to say it. The point of a company selling stocks is to raise money.
77 2018-09-02 22:47:30 when I first started to learn about stocks two decades ago the big thing was to diversify. Now the big call for beginners is to invest in what you know. Which I totally agree with more. I believe diversification is important but to a lesser degree than familiarity
78 2018-09-02 22:42:28 Agree and then on top of that there are 46 stocks in fno which have compulsory cash settlement so remember those also. No constructive work from the regulators
79 2018-09-02 22:40:53 Always thought future price derivation was applicable to stocks only.

84 2018-09-02 22:38:31 I wouldn't spend too much time, if any waiting on a maybe at best stock myself. Too many other good stocks to go long on.

86 2018-09-02 22:34:17 Seems some others never read a Clancy book and complain that Ryan is too boring. In the first book he had a job trading stocks for crying out loud and people expect the character to be John McLain.

119 2018-09-02 21:49:11 No need to click on that, if they were going to tell you the stocks they could have fit it in the tweet.
120 2018-09-02 21:47:26 Never tried it, so can't really comment. Depends on so many macro-variables I don't feel I adequately grasp at the moment. Haven't felt the need to learn yet with all the opportunities in stocks.

138 2018-09-02 21:21:15 Palace stocks really nice crockery 
139 2018-09-02 21:21:08 It will seem sudden. But they know. They're getting theirs while they can. It will be global & horrible IMO. Developing nations almost there right now. Bidding stocks up way beyond value,take the profits & crash
140 2018-09-02 21:20:56 Why am I not surprised lol njoy the holiday Big yin. Don’t forget the stocks a rock 
141 2018-09-02 21:19:30 @modern_rock Hey boss, just a quick question: Whats your opinion on trading forex? Is it harder trading it than stocks? Greetings
142 2018-09-02 21:19:23 LOL what a total idiot who ever is running for president or break laws while in office or still in office is the business of every American. Not big on education are you? Highest record taxes collected jobs, lowest unemployment GDP 4.2% stocks/401Ks record highs ISIS gone wages
143 2018-09-02 21:19:18 @incradible22 I just wanna know whether you track your trades? Per setup? Do you have favourite setup? You have IB account so shorting hot stocks can not be your focus. To start being consistable you have to have 1 single setup that you know you'll bank longterm. Any chatrooms?
144 2018-09-02 21:18:08 mon gloss c'est vraiment le meilleure fau jme rachete des stocks
145 2018-09-02 21:15:18 The tragedy, to me, is that in every hype cycle... No money is lost. It simply changes hands. During the dot com bubble... There were people who sold stocks at the top... The same is true of cryptocurrencies... Some people are making a ton of money every time a pump happens.
146 2018-09-02 21:11:54 I was listening then read that Harper and Trudeau are financially invested in oil stocks ! Is this true and why not a conflict of interest?
147 2018-09-02 21:11:43 So all the companies bringing back jobs happening now I guess was based off of Obama’s sound economy. The gdp at 4.2 was based of Obama’s sound economy his new norm was 1.9. Stocks new record highes under Trump. Obama’s policies and regulations shut all that down.
148 2018-09-02 21:11:32 Don't have to worry about dilution in the same way. Also I think you do see this is public companies but no one talks about. I have bought plenty of stocks at different price points. A bet that was right in 2008 can still be right in 2018 and you may want to keep adding to it

152 2018-09-02 21:10:05 Yeah they must be beside themselves about keeping their Halloumi stocks up at a fraction of the price. Phew!
153 2018-09-02 21:08:52 Then why is it that American big tobacco stocks have droppped immensely this year yet in India where they just banned ecigs the tobacco stocks rose 16% on the news?
154 2018-09-02 21:08:50 Any record store that stocks Ugly Things is a record store worth going to
155 2018-09-02 21:05:25 You are old.
60% of Workers have 40lKs and/or IRAs.
rising stock market drives up retirement benefits for those 60% and helps gov workers/unions workers whose defined benefit pensions are  backed by stocks.

157 2018-09-02 21:03:34 A few notes on this months picks:
- I can't accept US market or NEX stocks
- There were a couple who submitted EPIC codes which didn't exist. Let me know if you pick is missing
- Submitting picks using other peoples twitter username is pretty immoral if not borderline fraudulent
158 2018-09-02 21:03:31 There's a rally in those pot stocks at the moment.  I won't trade them out of principle.
159 2018-09-02 21:02:42 Another thing I was thinking about this week, as stocks like Apple and Lululemon hit new all time highs is all the minor stumbles that seemed like a big deal along the way. Like Antennagate. Or when those yoga pants pilled. Huge stories at the time. Ultimately irrelevant.
160 2018-09-02 21:02:20 You should always have at least a little bit in stocks.
161 2018-09-02 21:01:24 y’a pu ma taille sur asos pour le jogging :( eske ils refont souvent des stocks?
162 2018-09-02 21:01:20 How’s that when stocks had broken another record
163 2018-09-02 21:00:32 No since I'm not very particular with it. If I want a certain look I just switch film stocks. Then again I am more of a C41 colour shooter.

165 2018-09-02 20:59:54 It's a privately owned company, there are no stocks to buy....unfortunately!
166 2018-09-02 20:58:55 Very cool! @McGillins has amazing Sunday night karaoke  @FSPhiladelphia has a great lounge and new location @nordstromrack great sales - save $ for stocks ;) @July4thPhilly come back then! @dpbell @michael_nutter
167 2018-09-02 20:58:41 If those stocks are to be avoided, need to wait for another month for initila entry ? 
Or taking an entry as per Q1 and making an exit if after close of Month 2 CCI 34 M does not remain above 100 ?
168 2018-09-02 20:57:09 Well John I feel for you not being able to profit on some of these pot stocks the past two weeks - some great action both long & short on them. Check out these scans as they have been providing great alerts.
169 2018-09-02 20:57:04 This means the first day after close of the month, for how many stocks CCI 34 on monthly still remains above 100 ?
And an entry on retracement (when CCI D dips to 60) to be taken. 
Is it ok to go from monthly to Hourly for finding best entry ?
170 2018-09-02 20:54:30 First time playing 64 and I took 10 stocks in a crew battle because I’m a fucking god
171 2018-09-02 20:54:22 am i weird being excited for stocks on christmas eve now?
172 2018-09-02 20:53:05 Indeed, different industries. Strategic investors attracted into utilities, their shareholders know they own defensive stocks. FMCG e.g. beer are growth stocks, hence higher returns.
173 2018-09-02 20:51:41 Cryptocurrencies and Cannabis had the strong year 2018. Both gaining more than 1000% in Marketcap. Why is there no ICO for a Token used in Canadian Weed Stores and builds new stores with the Revenue? #iwouldinvest #noad #bitcoin #cannabis #canada #stocks #ifthereisonenameit
174 2018-09-02 20:51:07 accepting such a destiny, and, finally, punishment, its cruelty, the intrinsic quality which enables a criminal to glory in stocks
175 2018-09-02 20:49:37 Here’s the thing: MOST OF US don’t have stocks to care. We allowed pensions to get turned into 401Ks so stock boys could play with our money. Some folks lost their entire retirement and they only say ‘oops’. This gambling problem must go.
176 2018-09-02 20:48:19 Niveau disponibilité... Le fait que ce soit encore un jeune éditeur  empeche de dire si il va y avoir des stocks épuisés, surtout qu'il ne  s'agit pas de "grosses" séries

187 2018-09-02 20:33:22 Oh don't get me wrong it's not the climate science getting the coin. It's all those enjoying the govt subsidies and mining stocks. 
Warren Buffett famously said the only reason why he has invested in renewables is because of govt subsidies. It's a safeguard bet.
188 2018-09-02 20:33:05 Yeah, plenty of reason P/S can change with evolution of index components. But still concerned that trailing P/Es (even adjusted for taxes) are at levels where stocks have lagged treasuries for decade+ periods.
189 2018-09-02 20:28:45 I heard the other day 40-50 % of US stocks are owned by foreigners anyway so good for them.
190 2018-09-02 20:28:18 I think last week i learned the importance of not over reacting and automatically selling stocks when i see a dip because some things take time to turn into their final form
191 2018-09-02 20:27:19 Fine, if companies, as you said, lower their prices to the point of making no money or even losing money, wat do you think will happen to their stocks, do you actually think someone whould risk that? Also, wouldn’t it be more profitable to buy the company??
192 2018-09-02 20:26:16 After the first CCI 34 Mthly pip above 100 there is a tendency to dip below 100 next month. Skip those stocks.
193 2018-09-02 20:22:02 How will small companies produce capital? Each will issue a shitcoin? More likely bitcoin-backed tokens will be used to buy small cap stocks.
194 2018-09-02 20:21:15 Are those the only two stocks he’s picked?
195 2018-09-02 20:21:00 
196 2018-09-02 20:19:23 Who trynna show me how to invest in stocks
197 2018-09-02 20:17:40 Bullish Bearish or Sharkish. 

Asset backed (#crypto) coins will eventually replace small cap stocks.

Have picked stocks where CCI34 (Monthly) has crossed 100 from below this month and closed with Strength candle. (1/3)
201 2018-09-02 20:15:29 We need to ban more bump stocks.  That’s the problem.

211 2018-09-02 20:08:09 In the spartan stocks, Steve Dorer had issues in the #2 Bob Bauer owned car, and has switch to the #07 owned by Jordan Harvey. After a couple car shuffles, we have 18 spartan stocks.
212 2018-09-02 20:07:42 So I hope my stocks go off the charts in the following order .. for personal re-investment reasons   #AAOG  then #Thor which allows me to bring my average down on #ecr and punt #xtr and maybe #ast before dropping more on #ggp which is my biggest holding.
213 2018-09-02 20:04:56 Does the new e book touch on your favorite stocks in these sectors ?
214 2018-09-02 20:04:42 My trading strategy is always the same with these sub-penny and penny stocks. They are all trash. Trade the price action. Wait for the reaction to the news. And when the pumpers really turn up the heat and their BS hype...SELL into strength. I'll hold $INND a little longer.
215 2018-09-02 20:04:42 Anyone can pick stocks in a bull market! What about his losers? Everyone brags about winners but not losers. It’s not about how much money you make, it’s about how much you can’t lose!

226 2018-09-02 19:52:09 put it a different way, if momentum algos were allowed to trade mkts freely without central bank "regulation" what do you think would happen?  momentum algos would sell stocks to zero and send 10yr yields to 10% in a matter of months. mkts will never trade freely again
227 2018-09-02 19:51:57 Thinking of starting to buy stocks. Worth it?

233 2018-09-02 19:36:36 Been look at a number of tech/pharm stocks that have exponential growth the past year...unsustainable.

250 2018-09-02 19:19:15 Good analysis. To add to the point, running the speed option to the weak side ruins the whole point of overloading the zone, you’re running into a double team...

261 2018-09-02 19:13:44 I keep it simple. Buy stocks that are above the 5ema on monthly chart. And my stop is prior months low. Ive learned many lessons over the years with over trading and making emotional decision.

268 2018-09-02 19:07:53 The people piling on with hate are all strangers to her feed and content, without a doubt. They just saw it going viral somewhere and waded in for the modern equivalent of hurling rotten fruit at someone in the stocks. Their abuse says far more about themselves!
269 2018-09-02 19:03:05 That’s $550 in 1yr, that’s $5500 in 10yrs , you can get NEtflix stocks now and watch it compound in 10yrs to stupid folds. #thinkFuture
270 2018-09-02 19:02:48 been listening to Motley Fool for a while now.  I think they are fool of crap and talk out of both sides of their mouth. In one article they are promoting MJ stocks and then saying the bubble will burst. They cover all the bases and then they can later say how they told  us so
271 2018-09-02 19:01:53 You’re so funny Mike! You change your mind/opinion like a day trader trades stocks!

302 2018-09-02 18:29:01 Not once have they offered a deal. Maybe because they know I wouldn’t except it, plus they want me gone from this earth. Because I know the stole $200,000 of stocks, bonds and CDs from my mother. Then tortured her to death. I’m the one who can testify to all of this!
303 2018-09-02 18:28:10 Seriously. They can’t name any policy that Trump has passed that would have any effect on those things. Unemployment has been decreasing since 2010. Stocks are up thanks to corporations getting a huge permanent windfall from the tax cut that will harm the working class.

305 2018-09-02 18:26:43 Here's a question, if a fund mgr has $tsla as part of their buy side portfolio with strong conviction, would you go long or short on the other stocks in his her portfolio?

346 2018-09-02 17:35:15 stocks are more for investors to know when its time to pull / increase their shares based on a company choices, if they were used purely for a company life, everytime shares were pulled from APPL, NIKE, AMZN they would be “supposedly” closing

351 2018-09-02 17:30:13 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

357 2018-09-02 17:19:18 I think I pulled a hamstring at stocks and I’ve never been so embarrassed / disappointed in myself
358 2018-09-02 17:18:44 Keeping all kinds of stocks is a portfolio right. Why are you avoiding 40 to 50% growth companies. I can't understand your logic behind that.
359 2018-09-02 17:18:37 Yes. He's bankrupted more companies than I can count. He's have done better putting his money into stocks than his properties. He owes as much as his properties are worth, to foreign banks because no one in America would lend to him. Oh and he's been played internationally. Next?
360 2018-09-02 17:15:25 Obama didn’t rob us.  The fact that many w preconditions could now get health care was and is a great thing- it is no different then social security and Medicare.

364 2018-09-02 17:12:31 I buys stocks because I see upside. Them beign a client has no bearing on my buys. I hold companies that are not client and companies that are. They all have one thing in common, I reckon it a decent investment. Of course I'm as correct as the next man.

367 2018-09-02 17:12:13 There will be survivors but I think 80% will fail miserably. It’s not much different than the stock market in that regard. How many micro cap (penny stocks) actually survive the long run?
368 2018-09-02 17:11:36 الله يسلمك من الشر
369 2018-09-02 17:11:31 The cost of a single is stupidly high. 4/6/6/7/8+ USD for a slice of story that entertains for way less than an hour (Including re-reads) is too much. Drop the shiny paper, save fancy stocks of covers and paper for events and TPB or prestige books.
370 2018-09-02 17:11:30 No one with intelligence is drinking your koolaid, Jim Jones. My stocks have nearly doubled, nicely recovering from the crash course they were on under Obama's reign.
371 2018-09-02 17:11:05 I completely agree with all your stocks. Shea looked pretty good too enjoying a little more brew than maize last night and I wondered why he wasn’t trying to scramble but after re watching the 1st half, it’s kinda hard when you have both edge rushers in your face all game!
372 2018-09-02 17:10:51 I see two key factors that set this case apart: 1) Mandate is wide enough to make it conceivable that two similar mgrs could implement using entirely different stocks 2) Huge embedded gain (+ outflows). You don’t usually have both of these factors present.

379 2018-09-02 17:06:53 Found it one oF the best channel....Accuracy, timing and stocks selection are amazing.
380 2018-09-02 17:05:57 I should say I don't disagree stocks may be overvalued. But at what opportunity cost are you leaning on that?  January 2017 is more than a few S&P points ago. But, that's what makes a market I guess.
381 2018-09-02 17:05:27 LMBO! I'm also in the blue collar league, and I have experienced the opposite! More jobs, and my stocks have skyrocketed, recovering from the terrifying crash course they were on under Obamas watch.

386 2018-09-02 17:02:12 Fix it by giving, no, GIFTING, taxpayer $$ to corps who buyback stocks, & his buds? That’s not a fix, it’s a fux!
387 2018-09-02 17:00:58 Lazy. How do you feel about the Amber Stocks dismissal?
388 2018-09-02 17:00:42 The math only works if you're long and short. E.g writing covered options on a larger number of high Beta stocks while hedging SPY. Or algo trading 8000 stocks. But being long-only, and in this asset class, not so. Need negative delta. Their real save is the Lendroid partnership.
389 2018-09-02 16:59:30 Use lists to view what you want, when you want. If you are into politics and stocks, have a list for each. If you get on Twitter and just want stocks, go to your list!

410 2018-09-02 16:43:47 stocks rise by 1%.
411 2018-09-02 16:43:18 of course, it's just that for those from the traditional markets, they can't comprehend holding assets after such a decline, although stocks don't produce such gains either.
412 2018-09-02 16:42:11 You can buy 1$ worth of Bitcoin even if you don't have a bank account. Far from "leaving out everyone without excess capital". I know people who own Bitcoin but not stocks because they don't have the capital to qualify for a brokerage account.
413 2018-09-02 16:41:59 Why pick on crypto, the same could be said about almost any financial or real asset that rises in price against fiat. People who buy early are compensated for risk and the TVM with  houses, land, companies, stocks , comic books, etc.

452 2018-09-02 15:51:46 That’s the point of large block sizes. Every tx that is pending on the network should clear within the next block, which is at most 10 minutes. Stocks and credit work in a similar way. Yes, “centralized databases”, but both “switch hands” faster than they actually settle.

540 2018-09-02 14:40:07 Stop trying to hold and hope for the homeruns on these garbage sub-penny stocks. Take your quick profits and then look for another similar trade. Practice and repetition is important in this game. You have to become self sufficient and stop listening to the pumpers to win.

562 2018-09-02 14:28:15 Declaring victory on the last 2 years of returns shows a lot of hubris.  Stocks at these multiples have always lagged treasuries on a decade+ basis. Good chance any “lost opportunity” is ephemeral. Anybody w/ a bias towards capital preservation has been wise to be cautious.

609 2018-09-02 13:53:43 What do you think think are shorts doing. Spreading fake news about Tesla without disclosing their positions on other stocks such as oil and other car companies where they stand to benefit if Tesla fails. Earth needs Tesla to succeed and big oil to fail.

664 2018-09-02 12:54:59 My mean reversion strategy is rolling me into gold stocks fairly aggressively. Compelling but a little scary when you look at the chart action and no catalyst for any currency but USD. Not sure which "mean" is going to happen here   :)

667 2018-09-02 12:49:14 It's a meme, where you replicate a stupid point the opposite side of an argument always keeps bringing up. For example-

674 2018-09-02 12:39:13 Not by itself. But you add in crap like trickle down economics(voodoo ), buying back stocks to artificially inflate value while companies on teetering on collapse, less and less elite pay their fair in taxes only covering capital gains tax, then tax break becomes tipping point
675 2018-09-02 12:39:12 is there a group out there that does stock market talk for young/new investors? i want to start investing in stocks but it seems so intimidating (and stuffy) (plus is it even a good idea in this duterte economy)

681 2018-09-02 12:33:24 Well put a feather in your cap for having equity in the stock market.  I however know that in my work place of 13 people, 11 don’t own any stocks let alone have a 401k.  Success on Wall Street doesn’t mean success on Main Street.
682 2018-09-02 12:33:05 In legitimate terms, lots of people that voted for him own 401ks, that contain stocks and mutual funds. So she is factually wrong...again.

696 2018-09-02 12:15:47 This is a poor application of the term. In the stock market, ROI has importance because an investor typically has a fixed amount to invest, that is far below the total value of a company. Therefore, picking the higher ROI between two stocks for an equal investment makes sense. …

831 2018-09-02 09:36:43 100% agree. When I was more active on AIM earlier in the year I had around 40 stocks in my portfolio. Now down to a more manageable 20. Less impact if there are poor performers that need to be cut. Hence I was able to close positions with 40% plus losses.

925 2018-09-02 06:54:14 Again. Similar situation to Titanfall 3. It's more than likely not gonna happen without a meat shield to take the PR Nightmare heat.

If they even try to, it could be a financial nightmare for their sheep and stocks. Rightfully so. Karma's not a kind queen to the wicked.

937 2018-09-02 06:36:01 Greed is on another level. It used to be closer to 50% stocks & 50% bonds was ideal, and something more along the lines of 70% bonds & 30% stocks when you were closer to retirement. Everyone just wants to chase yield these days. People have become immune to the risk with stocks.

943 2018-09-02 06:26:53 This critic is not desparate.  Just sad that evidently many are willing to accept that the ends justify the means: loss of health care, attacks on education, acceptance of white supremacists, destruction of the environment.  But hey, stocks are up.
944 2018-09-02 06:24:47 Thanks for the generous comments Reb. I sold CCC + 1 other on Friday banking a touch more profit so that leaves me now with 16 stocks + war chest inside the Voyager. That number will, of course, limit newsflow so from Sep the log will be weekly or fortnightly as RNSs flow.
945 2018-09-02 06:21:25 If you’re not investing eg in a stocks and shares ISA, you are losing real wealth every year as these savings accounts return less than real inflation. Cash ISAs etc are a total waste of time.

1056 2018-09-02 03:43:45 All this retirement talk makes me wonder who will make my health and financial decisions when I'm no longer able to take care of myself. Who will get the stocks? Who will get the assets?
1057 2018-09-02 03:41:38 People can't understand when and why I don't want to talk about what I do also who tells anyone about their next move. And they just want to get tips for stocks investment. Honey do your own research..

1068 2018-09-02 03:26:20 Haha hahaha....a few anecdotal examples.
Most of the corps did exactly what they said, the money would go to their invested to buy back stocks.
It didn't go to their employees.

1097 2018-09-02 02:48:29 TAX software, look into TradeLog , TOS stocks = Yes..Futures = Nope. Works with Ninjatrader and others. Download data, it puts all data into correct place, forms, etc.
1098 2018-09-02 02:47:48 Sadly most do. Especially the small guy. With respect you may not remember 98-00 period where the small investor was swiping his credit card at the store to buy ‘stocks of the day’ he didn’t know what the stock were. Cramer and the rest of the CNBC lunatics are people to avoid.

1129 2018-09-02 02:07:27 Generic but useful Smash(4) advice.

Assess follow up situations better. People lose stocks all the time from getting like down throw -> airdodge read -> Upsmashed when, more often than not, the most they would have ate was a bair/uair that wouldn't KO.
1130 2018-09-02 02:06:19 What fun, a promoted tweet.

1136 2018-09-02 01:59:14 There's a few laws I could get on board with. Like they can't sit on boards while serving. Cannot invest in stocks or businesses. Fully divested.  I have another. Damn it escaped me. But see where I was going?

1141 2018-09-02 01:54:12 When President Bush left, this country was economically broken. Two pathetic war didn’t leave anything for the government to give a federal worker a raise but senators and congressmen made millions from companies stocks who sold arms and ammunition to the government.
1142 2018-09-02 01:53:02 I got a weed ETF and some stocks on Robinhood.  $300 total in, worth $280 now after 9 months...

1144 2018-09-02 01:47:14 I think we’re heading towards a world where most firms offer cheap or free ETF’s and NO stock trading. 

I think in 10-15 years, it will be hard to find a firm that will allow you to buy and sell individual stocks. 

I know it sounds crazy.

This Fidelity free news is big IMO
1145 2018-09-02 01:45:59 Really? Only about 4% of workers will see increases in pay or will receive bonuses tied to the Trump administration taxcuts. The majority of companies will use the taxcut revenue for stock buybacks, which mostly helps the rich. The richest 10% own 84% of all stocks.
1146 2018-09-02 01:45:26 I know some of my followers are super investment savvy, so I hereby call upon you smartie pants for some words of wisdom!

1147 2018-09-02 01:42:05 "boom times" stock markets are up for one reason: deficit-fueled tax breaks allow the rich to buy more stocks, buying stocks increases the price of stocks. end of story. there are no boom times, just a bunch of gingerbread men eating their own gingerbread house

1155 2018-09-02 01:31:10 From investment POV the value prop. in crypto is that you could buy assets early (listings early) and HODL long term. 

If we compare even growth stocks Apple did ~10x in the last 10 years, BTC performed a slight bit better in this time. 

Short term is a waste of time IMO

1157 2018-09-02 01:31:01 Plus this isn't the stock market. Buying stocks u buy low sell high. Drafting you take a player and want them to contribute on the field, not build them up then sell. Otherwise u end up with a bunch of mediocre players and a stockpile of future draft picks.

1168 2018-09-02 01:16:27 Having it called the Wall Street speculation tax is deceptively misleading, it wouldn’t have affected only ws type firms, but all investment purchases (stocks, bonds, etc.).  This is mainly how the middle class retires.

1170 2018-09-02 01:11:42  ummmm, no. We struggled through the 8 years, besides wasn’t it you guys who said it was Trumps fault when stocks dipped a little? Now it’s thanks Obama?Can’t have it both ways, sorry can’t brainwash this one, I can think for myself.

1176 2018-09-02 01:01:45 Why is it never considered that when they sold they may have made venture investments? Or bought a building? Or acreage in the Permian? So many investments out there besides stocks, bonds and cash!

1178 2018-09-02 00:58:07 Before the stockmarket crash in 1929, there was a huge boom and a lot of regular people had stocks and gathered wealth. Those same people suffered more after the boom cause they kept investin in what had worked for them. The banks were subsidizing 75% of some investments.
1179 2018-09-02 00:56:23 I remain very cautious, although fully invested in U.S. stocks. The stronger the economy, the stronger the stock market, the stronger corporate profits, the higher income, the pressure on the Fed is mitigated, not negated, but mitigated. Each week, month, year must be reevaluated
1180 2018-09-02 00:55:23 Sobering, isn't it? When stocks are high Wall Street wins, when stocks go down little guy suffers.
1181 2018-09-02 00:55:07 Thank you! We had to leave our country to bring our kids to a free country and now we are terrified that our grandkids may have to grow up in the same nightmare we left behind ! I just can't believe how people can belive the socialists lies !

1186 2018-09-02 00:44:33 I listen to his speeches. Watch what he does/says and even tweets. It's safer that way. Listen, if some crap surfaces about him colluding with Russia, I'm first in linreto denounce him. I just don't see it and my stocks are up.

1191 2018-09-02 00:39:26 That’s my summarized answer lol, and I said bump stops and meant bump stocks!
1192 2018-09-02 00:38:33 There is blind, and blind hate. Sadly both refer to the loser libs & MSM who are crippled with the Clinton election loss. Against economy boom? Jobs? Stocks soaring? Tax cuts? Peace? Trade deals? COME ON! 
1193 2018-09-02 00:37:37 The people who helped Stephen Harper hoodwink the gormless NIMBY crowd don't care that he was lousy at public policy - they hate go'vt & didn't help him to power for us, they did it for themselves! He said himself of the recession "good time to buy stocks " (Let them eat cake)
1194 2018-09-02 00:37:28 There is no brainwashing. Stocks are high! Unemployment for all Americans is low. You got tax breaks so did we. We want to value our country and citizens. We want safety. We want honesty. HRC was and always be a bad choice.
1195 2018-09-02 00:37:27 That bull market started with Obama. Stocks are up more because corps are buying back stock than for any other reason. What part do you not understand?
1196 2018-09-02 00:37:10 I think they got money out of Disney sales. It can't be their stocks they aren't selling any of it as far as I know.

1199 2018-09-02 00:30:56 Buy stocks on margin , order sell at 4 % lost ,    of course maybe something you cannt do because of the pain of being on a capitialist campaign. But if you truly care about everyone equally just burn all your mo ey this will increase the value of the dollar.
1200 2018-09-02 00:28:53 PSA: People who are loaded honestly don’t consider themselves loaded. I’m talking owning 10 houses (some rental properties), stocks, making WAY over 6 figures etc... they consider themselves comfortable because there are always people with more money than them.

1266 2018-09-01 23:34:56 Most Americans cannot afford a 401k. 80% of stocks owned are owned by the top 10% wealth holders in America. Sounds like you prefer party over country. A proud Venezuelan tradition. One party rule, like NK, China, Russia, Cuba. Coming soon to USA if Republicans get their way.
1267 2018-09-01 23:34:04 Saying a real estate man bankrupted so many companies is like saying  a stockbroker / picker lost on so many stocks. Ea real estate deal is in a separate make-or-break company.  That’s wrong.

1278 2018-09-01 23:24:17 Empirically, i have found that earnings estimates lose their effect on a stock when the fiscal yr in question is < six months away. So when a company has a December fiscal yr, I will no longer look at that yr's estimate after June. This is also logical, as most believe...#stocks

1288 2018-09-01 23:16:59 LOL  I've always like safer investments like mutual funds and cd's, but even mutual funds is like gambling.  Stocks are worse.  Dad did call it gambling, but with a better chance of getting lucky.

1291 2018-09-01 23:11:13 For those who value earnings estimates, the '18 estimates should be ignored since the '18 calendar year is over in four mos. Institutions are focused on companies' prospects for '19 as they make decisions whether to buy, add, or fold #stocks

1294 2018-09-01 23:10:12 Being aware of economics is when one becomes an adult after 21, or 25 start earning, knowing how to save, skimp, invest, spend sendibly, we then get to receive sales invoices, pay slips, perhaps watch stocks which I did not know till I was in my 40s.Test questions not relevant

1297 2018-09-01 23:05:16 Fair point.  If you bought stocks in April 2000 u just broke even.  We can slice this a lot of ways.
1298 2018-09-01 23:03:36 I am going to run for office and submit a bill to tax everyone including politicians and the elite at 100%, confiscate all bank accounts, 401Ks, stocks.

1304 2018-09-01 22:58:47 Well, if you're into stocks, this is a good thing, right? The hemline index. Which, btw,  was proposed by a prof from the same school Trump went to ...Wharton.

1306 2018-09-01 22:56:54 Wall street will crash bases on inflation cost of living so buying stocks goes down why ppl won't be able to affordable the products that has a investment on wall street by buying shares of such will drive wall street down but inflation rising based on relations down to nothing

1309 2018-09-01 22:56:05 Investors fail to recognize Sprott's brilliance. It has not been stock picking. He made the vast majority of his fortune on one brilliant move. He and his funds unloading tech in 1999-00 and going full bore into commodity stocks, especially gold, at the very start of the bull.

1311 2018-09-01 22:54:40 TWN Stocks: Let's get back to TMB (4147 中裕) - let's say it can achieve $100M NTD in sales this year (don't think it can), there are 250M shares outstanding.  Valuing TMB (4147 中裕) at sales will give it a share price of $0.40 NTD per share.  In other words, it's a total fraud.
1312 2018-09-01 22:52:57 When it hits high enough cash out and start investing in some big boy stocks

1318 2018-09-01 22:48:04 stocks trading below $5 could be considered risky with no fundamental story to invest in though these stocks could pay well if story changes on positive news. We can all go back and can name so many stocks below $5 at one point and now are blockbuster companies in the making.
1319 2018-09-01 22:46:38 I’d suggest reading or even trying to get a job in real estate and learn the trade. I can’t really help out cause I mainly focus on trading/buying stocks. Reading does help a lot though

1334 2018-09-01 22:26:50 I will also add that your 30% growth would be a valid argument if investors bought stocks and never wanted their money back. But the last I checked, people do want their money back ;) 

People don't buy stocks cuz they love stocks. They buy stocks cuz they want more real money.

1343 2018-09-01 22:13:22 I can’t prove it, just observe odd behavior in the stocks, esp $BABA. On days or weeks when US-China trade news worsens, somehow it is flat or up. Even $CAT or $DE go up and down more logically. Almost feels like someone trying to keep $BABA afloat. Wonder when they’ll let it go.
1344 2018-09-01 22:12:38 Wish you all the best, with Trump and the trade wars are going to hurt a lot of people, people we depend on for food, yes stocks are going up, but not the ones the will help the famers , and the banks are not offering to help, really sad!

1351 2018-09-01 22:06:57 You mean the stock market which is pure speculation, tied with the massive tax cuts to large corp's which let them use much of their capital to buy back their own stocks and raise their value. That has nothing to do with the Job market or wage growth.

1396 2018-09-01 21:21:38 I don't get the appeal to combos that unnecessarily trade stocks when stocks are tied. You were bodying your opponent, you could have a stock lead, but now it's tied again. 

It just seems suboptimal unless you guarantee a lead
1397 2018-09-01 21:20:40 Thats factually  wrong on its face.  The tax cut (as has happened each time trickle down economics is attempted) failed to reach the working class. Corporate America simply bought their own stocks with the extra scratch, and the cut has added trillions to our debt. It FAILED.
1398 2018-09-01 21:20:36 do my own stock investments and percentage wise,  my portfolio has out performed my " home " return year after year. The joy of stocks is you can buy /sell /profit take anytime. If you know what you are doing...it works. Balance sheet & buy what you know.

1406 2018-09-01 21:06:09 You are absolutely ignorant. 18 million people live in extreme poverty in the US. Stocks are up but wages are down.   And the cost of living just went up 3.2 percent.  How is that good for anyone but the rich?
1407 2018-09-01 21:04:01 The rich earn passive income using these 3 main sources:

1412 2018-09-01 20:55:26 This is my dilemma. I like the active management, and possibly it works better in crypto. An example of the other way: simply holding FANG stocks absolutely crushed actively-managed funds over the past 8 years. And during other market cycles, active funds beat hodl funds.
1413 2018-09-01 20:55:20 I understand the consequence inflating stocks and investment assets of the rich. I just question whether the poorest 20% benefited at all.
1414 2018-09-01 20:50:58 Well, I'm not a fan, but coming from a moderately educated standpoint, unemployment has dropped, stocks have risen, and there are works in progress to help fix our poor VA healthcare. Guy's a douche, but he is trying.
1415 2018-09-01 20:50:40 Bull shit!  You obviously don't have any stocks, or own your home, or have an EDUCATION. WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE. Just because you've had your food stamps taken away is no reason to bash out President.  LEAVE!
1416 2018-09-01 20:50:25 Pero "VALUE STOCKS" sin aquéllas que están infravaloradas por sus ratios y mas "GROWTH STOCKS" las que tienen flujo de caja positivo y cuyos ingresos y beneficios crecen de forma constante y no suelen pagar dividendo, sino que aprovechan el di ero para seguir creciendo, ¿no?
1417 2018-09-01 20:49:17 I wasn’t clear enough.  I wasn’t suggesting a trade/ market timing, just that we need to anticipate we may have a nasty correction in the stocks before they really take off, but also a buying opportunity.
1418 2018-09-01 20:47:12 Still like my re-run of the town square stocks.

Very therapeutic.
1419 2018-09-01 20:47:09 I will check stocks and let you know what we have. Short sleeve or long sleeve?
1420 2018-09-01 20:45:28 Again. You read nothing and never tried it and you know everything. You are a pharmaceutical industry rep or you have some vested interest in the stocks of allopathic medicine or you would not be so vehemently against natural cures. In use homeopathy numbnutz. It works.
1421 2018-09-01 20:43:50 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1422 2018-09-01 20:42:27 Just read moving averages which was a great book well done Steve. Now looking for criteria on selecting stocks, which book helps with that?
1423 2018-09-01 20:40:10 A fund versus all eggs in one basket. I can never decide which to go with. In the stock market, I made my money firing hard at 1-3 stocks against recommendations to diversify. In crypto I start with a thesis on a few coins but usually end up fomo-ing onto coins into a fund.

1431 2018-09-01 20:31:24 @BothamsofWhitby hi can you tell me where stocks your biscuits? Got some today and they are lush.
1432 2018-09-01 20:30:48 I have bought quite a few different stocks from ebay, Nik & Trick and had a few rolls of Kodak 50D from @mparry1234 .. he bought a bulk roll and was selling them ... do you follow him?

1436 2018-09-01 20:24:06 Absolutely agree and been saying so for years. Latest tinkering & rushed legislation doesn't help. We just bounce along here with no stability whilst the pre 2003 can progress and improve with security. More carrots less stocks e.g income tax suggestion.

1439 2018-09-01 20:20:25 Central questions pressed into hands & actions larger than mine is:
1) will we file in time to get what we paid for?
2) will it get any better borrowing cheap & buying from ourselves w  loans anymore? 
3) can retail interest in stocks to grow outpace int & inflation ahead?
Nope
1440 2018-09-01 20:19:33 It's okay dude, it's @OfficialSPGB that has to release me. It's crazy as we have people @PeoplesMomentum in the UK who think that this is the solution to their problems, or low growth, stagnant wages and lack of government spending. It scares me. I hope you're ok now.

1445 2018-09-01 20:11:47 The economy is performing at roughly the same rate it was from 2013-2017. The stock market has risen largely due to the fact that stocks have a high rate of return compared to bonds. And our allies are laughing at us.

1521 2018-09-01 18:55:39 If it plays out that way, then we can probably expect a bit more ramp in #u308 prices and big ramp in stocks, then a potentially large drop in the stocks sometime next year when the expected rocket ship hasn't taken off yet.  If that plays out, major buying opportunity coming up.

1523 2018-09-01 18:53:48 In my experience, the public, middle class and wealthy alike, have a very weak understanding of asset returns and risks.

1526 2018-09-01 18:47:28 To answer your original question, try and buy one good stock each month for next 12 months. Change the plan only if you find a major market drawdown. In that case, buy 2-3 stocks post 10-15% index correction, then continue with balance of monthly purchases.
1527 2018-09-01 18:46:58 Feels like I have a lot of stocks hovering in the upper 80s. Might be a good test to see if that 90/100 rule still works.

1563 2018-09-01 18:00:33 Fruit and veg stocks are rubbish in Kirkstall Morrisons. Had to go to a separate supermarket just to buy 1 bloody cauliflower. Don't even get me started on the quality of the loose bananas that were left.
1564 2018-09-01 18:00:31 I had tweeted earlier this year that many old adages like 'Sell in May...'  were exactly that - old!, Looking through a list of bellwether stocks that I review now and then. the vast majority showed 'breakouts' in April & May and since have run up handsomely! Trust the charts!!
1565 2018-09-01 17:58:54 With car payment and house payment I probably am negative.  But I do have some stocks and saving, plus a pension.
1566 2018-09-01 17:58:04 Donald J Trump is THE worst ever trade dealer the world has ever seen! 
Yes the stock markets may be increasing while he’s been in power, but stocks do not make Presidents!
Country leaders help their country to prosper! Trump sanctions everyone and puts tariffs on them....
1567 2018-09-01 17:57:47 As management executes and stocks ascend, liquidity increases. Don’t worry about illiquidity, worry about being right.
1568 2018-09-01 17:52:58 A lot of Dow stocks are not acting healthy. As soon as they get a few days of traction they get beaten back down.

1574 2018-09-01 17:50:27 Took the advice of an employee who mentioned one store that stocked Clinique also stocks Bvlgari.

They were correct especially when I would go out of town to test out some of the newer fragrances. It is always good to try and find them at a local store versus travelling outside.
1575 2018-09-01 17:50:17 1) No nos va mal económicamente por la corrupción (aunque ayuda) sino por el Estatismo, que es la causa. 2) Nos iba bien por el viento de cola internacional, y nos comíamos los stocks, no se invertía (luz, agua, rutas, hospitales, escuelas...).Ahora pagás las consec de la fiesta.

1581 2018-09-01 17:45:54 It varies right, nothing is set in stone, correlations do break. A great way to look at that is looking at correlations between US stocks and US bonds and how they change through time. Or with gold.
1582 2018-09-01 17:45:52 Government run health care and huge donations from Big Pharm equals a lot of money for insurance companies investors (think stocks), Big Pharm and corrupt politicians. Why do you think Bernie and other socialists and liberals are pushing it ?
1583 2018-09-01 17:45:37 Yea I just come on twitter and make stuff up with no basis in reality.   I was totally off when I said Dollar strength would cause ROW problems.  Totally off when said a currency crisis would begin.  Totally off when said US stocks would rise.

1587 2018-09-01 17:44:12 For most stocks I carefully pick entry points and establish exit point with the margin I am happy with. Works for me.

For crypto, we are way too early. I keep accumulating - and hodling obviously, for at least a few more years.

1592 2018-09-01 17:39:33 Absolutely, locals are caught up in the speculation, by choice and not, Foreign funds seem to be trading #vanre like hot stocks. Demand measures & opening up supply, with a focus on PBR. No CAC's on PBR! The $4k/month places will be the cheap ones in the future. Build lots!
1593 2018-09-01 17:39:23 Iff you have stocks.  And therein Shep will attest this trend started under Obama and has nothing to do with politics.  The 2008 bailout gave biz a lift and the success is theirs.

1596 2018-09-01 17:33:45 Dividend stocks are great if you need consistent income and don’t care about growth. They also have less volatility during recessions.
1597 2018-09-01 17:33:17 1Don't think low/high about self, have strong emotion control
2Nobody has control over stock rallies or fall, nobody is expert
3Don't start with small stocks, start with proven businesses
4Don't buy at 52w high
5If crowd is chasing a stock don't buy it
Final one read good books!

It's like feminism.  If you're not a feminist, you're a misogynist, period.

1627 2018-09-01 17:02:40 $BTC approaching resistance at $8k. If it breaks with volume it's game on. Expect block chain stocks to follow suit.
1628 2018-09-01 17:00:31 Haha yeah. I have ~4 scams tucked away just in case, but only the best of the best. Low float, low dilutive potential, charts primed for ATHs. Honestly though, there are so many stocks to trade. I'm not gonna beat myself up over missing a bunch if I catch the moves I want.
1629 2018-09-01 16:59:49 Van a tener que liquidar stocks asumiendo algún tipo de pérdida. Cuál es el problema. Acaso salimos todos indemnes de esto?
1630 2018-09-01 16:58:41 I don't have the answer. I just know the economy is very strong and the stocks that should benefit are not. Thus my question.
1631 2018-09-01 16:56:48 When you buy used takatakas, you think everyone stocks used.
1632 2018-09-01 16:56:27 Hard time digesting that anything had to do with light skinned or not, they spoke of moods, nuances, the economy will take care of itself with or without a POTUS, corp. tax breaks will pump up stocks short term the engine is the consumer
1633 2018-09-01 16:55:55 Over the short run Mr Market acts like a wildly emotional guy who can buy or sell stocks at depressed or inflated prices.

1637 2018-09-01 16:52:58 My pet peeve with youtube comments on stock videos is that stocks isn't a hard science which means there are multiple ways to be "right". And since everyone has an opinion, everyone just agrees and supports with what they think is right.

2. Select Large, Prominent, Conservatively Financed Companies...

1. Note down all the suggested stocks with conditions
2. find which stock started moving
3. Take small quantity
4. if it goes your way add some more quantity
5. make strong SL as suggested

1671 2018-09-01 16:28:35 it's relative growth expectations. People must go long some stocks and short/sell some other stocks. They choose to go long $AMZN and $MSFT, etc. and short or sell $IP and others Beyond that it's hard to find causality.

Check it again in about 10 weeks and all the money I invested will be worth close to double could cash out now but I wann invest in more companies
1680 2018-09-01 16:20:57 If they bring someone with experience in, I wouldn’t be mad about a coach/GM position. I don’t think they set Coach Stocks up for success with that, even if she wanted it that way. I’ll be interested to see who they pick — and if players get much say.
1681 2018-09-01 16:20:41 Wouldn’t it be nice to regularly get airtime on CNBC to ‘promote’ your fave stocks. Over the last several years that channel‘s turned into quite a shit show.
1682 2018-09-01 16:19:21 Two pieces of advice for you Judy , Get out of a blue state… And go buy some stocks! And the rise of groceries is inflation , And That’ll never stop! Doesn’t matter who’s in office, it went up under Obama too. Oh, quit shopping at Whole Foods.

1684 2018-09-01 16:17:46 Institutions or fund managers have extremely huge volumes of stocks to buy and sell so they normally choose the news items, result days where lot of retail investors can be trapped to fulfill their needs so be aware of result days and news.Just think of who is on the other side.
1685 2018-09-01 16:16:34 Investing in mane on the stocks, a wise judgment or a terrible call, who gives a fuck
1686 2018-09-01 16:15:52 I think auto's have peaked, excuse me yes peaked.  Rates, prices, more leased auto's returning in the cycle.  So why is SIRI hanging in there when F, GM, and other auto stocks are not?
1687 2018-09-01 16:14:12 or mock them and make the people holding them laughing stocks so the next person doesn't think to do this.
1688 2018-09-01 16:14:09 Why haven’t you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?

1691 2018-09-01 16:12:24 We need to curb corporate oligarchs who take advantage of the system to benefit the few.  Limit CEO pay in stocks and increase profit sharing among its workers.

1708 2018-09-01 15:57:10 . . . they said they would do.  They are using the windfall to buy back stocks and to give themselves raises. None of it is going to the workers. In the meantime workers' incomes are not keeping up with inflation. What are you doing in the WH? Please GO AWAY!!!
1709 2018-09-01 15:56:42 I last purchased something in June... but it’s very sporadic investment based on opportunities. The overall market impression is we’ve reached a very expensive valuation. I am not comfortable investing in stocks with >25pe
1710 2018-09-01 15:56:33 Why won’t any of them (including the #MAGA people now) admit that the measures we use for the economy have nothing to do with regular people who don’t own stocks and live paycheck to paycheck?
1711 2018-09-01 15:55:46 I feel like more of an adult when I’m checking stocks before Snapchat’s.

-Beer
-Stocks
-Cars/Truck
-Airfare

FACT: The U.S. Federal deficit was $587 billion in Obama’s last year and it grew to $666 billion in Trump’s first year of his presidency.

1717 2018-09-01 15:53:45 For what ??? Stocks booming economy great!! Jobs every where all that other noise is just that noise
1718 2018-09-01 15:52:48 Stocks tend to take the stairs to the upside and the elevator to the downside. Therefore, the VIX volatility index typically rises during selloffs and acts as a put option on the equities market.
1719 2018-09-01 15:52:35 Why won’t any of them (including the #MAGA people now) admit that the measures we use for the economy have nothing to do with regular people who don’t own stocks and live paycheck to paycheck?
1720 2018-09-01 15:52:35 Trump is your President. Either you Hate it or You like it. learn to Love it. Going to be a strong 6 more years. My 401k is going great, nice raise, my stocks are going up, GDP highest its been in decades.
1721 2018-09-01 15:50:02 You will be surprised how little I trade on main accounts. And it takes time and discipline, can’t change overnight. It’s funny I was telling other friend last night to focus just few stocks and only have one or two positions. I advise something I can’t even do. LoL
1722 2018-09-01 15:49:04 Is 1broker stock trading? Only ever used Interactive Brokers+Robinhood for stocks. Thus far, only used Bittrex+GDax+Kraken for crypto.
1723 2018-09-01 15:48:38 The only person brainwashed is the person spewing this garbage.
Where are the facts to back up your gibberish ?
Stocks up! Unemployment down. Consumer confidence up. Median household income is up. Gas prices are down.
Jobs are being created. Better trade deals for the USA !

1727 2018-09-01 15:45:20 My thoughts were on the index and not in any individual stocks. Within the index there will always be out peformers &  under performers.  Stick to your own strategy to exit

1731 2018-09-01 15:40:26 Now that makes me reconsider keeping my account and stocks with them. Just because of principle.

1735 2018-09-01 15:38:20 Would be great to invest into this company stocks ..
1736 2018-09-01 15:37:58 Ya CNBC was sorta interfering with the election saying how stocks would plummet if trump was elected for over a month. You should really stop 
1737 2018-09-01 15:37:41 Who the fu*k eats spag bol on public transport?! This person needs to be named and shamed - then put in the stocks so we can throw meatball at them!
1738 2018-09-01 15:37:41 so tell me everything your investment portfolio contains stocks of? 
if you can't be thankful you have an investment portfolio & never forget young black men are systematically brought into the prison system because they create more revenue for L & R arms & families be damned...
1739 2018-09-01 15:36:48 Stackin my money, invest in the stocks
1740 2018-09-01 15:36:41 Watching my stocks climb.
1741 2018-09-01 15:36:30 Cryptocurrency is not money or stocks and is bought by naive people. Risk value is enormous!
1742 2018-09-01 15:35:20 With stocks at all-time highs (again), all of those telling you to sell US stocks have been very wrong and have missed one of the greatest bull markets of all-time. Did you listen to those clowns or did you follow price instead? We choose price every time. It’s the only truth.
1743 2018-09-01 15:35:11 A third:  #dinosaur.  Inconceivable that a major #CPG company wouldn't know who stocks it and where. Whoever wrote the tweet was too lazy to track down the info.
1744 2018-09-01 15:35:03 You just can't give the name of the stock?  You are making tons of $$$$ from all these stocks and you just can't bring yourself to give the name of this 1 stock? I get it, you provide a service, but stop rubbing others peoples noses in your wealth and say you need more money.
1745 2018-09-01 15:33:44 Things I have always wanted to do in RP but have never had the time, partner, or chance:

Partake an actual gangbang.
Cum on someone and present them to the TL still coated.
Drag someone stuck on a knotted cock into public.
Double barrel blowjob.

See the pattern ???!!!
1752 2018-09-01 15:27:37 Yeah but he’s the best and most proven of the three and hands down their best player...meanwhile Gruden stocks the roster with veteran (OLD) retreads... LMFAO Chucky’s gone senile bruh... #ImLovingIt #FailureNation
1753 2018-09-01 15:26:45 Be interesting to see which stocks ‘his’ companies buy after he says something negative or imposes legislation....then flips the statement or decision. Market always responds....
1754 2018-09-01 15:26:07 Oh, right. Women don't buy stocks. I forgot about that.
1755 2018-09-01 15:25:50 35-14, Stocks over from close out.

1759 2018-09-01 15:24:18 Seeing how you predicted him getting elected would sink stocks! We can not believe you.
1760 2018-09-01 15:24:05 Themes:
$XLK - Stretched, setups already been played out. Few stocks that offer good R/R. Needs to pull back/consolidate/and set up for next leg.
$XLY - Same as above.
$XOP - Looks ready to RIP. Rotation back in?
$XLP - grinding lower, could see rotation into it from tech
1761 2018-09-01 15:23:46 Stocks are overwhelming owned by older citizens using their 401 k etc to supplement their retirement. These ppl are Main Street Americans. This is a truth the left conveniently leave out.

1770 2018-09-01 15:16:16 That's the part that makes crypto a trap like the wild west of Forex, penny stocks.

1778 2018-09-01 15:10:31 Sir, What about stocks in your PMS ? You have become too complacent on the past performance and didn’t bother to act on your current portfolio when it’s falling like a knife. Some are down 60% from your buying point. Hope you are watching them.

1781 2018-09-01 15:09:33 Mine been moving up slow but I’ll be up soon, I have like 4 different stocks
1782 2018-09-01 15:08:45 Yep..  Hear hear with some merit. 

US Equities? Safe Haven?

It was all a setup, a bull trap in a hugely illiquid market one week before the long weekend pumping 2 stocks - APPL and Bezos.

Wait until next week, when the real traders come back from vacation.
1783 2018-09-01 15:08:33 The stock market is doing great. Do you have stocks? Has that helped you? Check with someone who needs the VA and tell me he's doing better under Trump. and SCOTUS? Really? McConnell stole that pick from Obama and you're touting it?
1784 2018-09-01 15:08:32 Aumentas el precio de lista, q es la base, dsp arrancas con las promociones  ( descuentos ) y financiaciones baratas, ahi bajan los precios. Es asi como regulan los stocks y vtas
1785 2018-09-01 15:07:04 So what if people own stocks. It's a great investment with trumps pro business agenda. When you pull $ out- it is taxed, no way around it. I love my "crumbs" I get from the trump tax cuts- economy is booming. Lib talking points can't debunked that.
1786 2018-09-01 15:04:27 Buying Pharma and PSU Banks makes sense here. If there is pain in PSU Banks, medicines will help. If there is pain in Pharma stocks, personal loans from PSU Banks would help
1787 2018-09-01 15:03:31 I need to take stocks on footsites asap
1788 2018-09-01 15:03:12 28-0 after 'Trees pressure on line, Stocks break and slip lots of tackles to go in under the posts. 80m play
1789 2018-09-01 15:02:22 like i guess it's better to call them "stocks" with a predefined growth in share count, where fluctuations as high as these are just possible
1790 2018-09-01 15:01:56 A really sweet spot is when you have selected a suite of stocks where frequent buy and homework evaluations result in longterm buy and hold for these stocks. You should address transaction costs.
1791 2018-09-01 15:01:07 For those pondering whether this parabolic move on stocks has more to run, you have an issue.  Last Monday, the $SPX gapped up, creating an ISLAND at highs, if this gap gets filled and holds then maybe we go higher, if it dont, or we gap down to it, get your parachutes ready
1792 2018-09-01 15:00:56 Look into how Pelosi AND Schumer got rich? When Obama was about to bail out banks, he told them. They dumped their underperforming stocks & bought those banks for pennies on the $. When banks were bailed they made millions. Insider trading. It’s same thing Martha S. jailed for.
1793 2018-09-01 14:58:31 You’re more likely to find happiness by shorting the FANG stocks than by believing in the Chicago Bears
1794 2018-09-01 14:58:27 Full disclosure, please... over that same five year period, what other stocks did he recommend that ended up tanking, or would have tanked someone's portfolio if they had relied on his advice? Please don't tell me that, in the course of five years, he recommended only two stocks.
1795 2018-09-01 14:57:36 Hola Michael. Las estrategias que enseña Tim son muy buenas a mi parecer. Y sobretodo las Reglas, manejo de capital, patrones y estilo son lo mejor para Penny Stocks Traders. Es mi opinión personal.
1796 2018-09-01 14:57:21 Fantasy football draft strategy... and pot stocks.. can they make you a millionaire?
1797 2018-09-01 14:56:29 Watched James Dean’s “Rebel Without a Cause.” What a movie. Timeless. Couldn’t help but notice the 10 cent coffees and 25 cent shoe shines. My reaction? Own stocks, not bonds. Inflation is unrelenting. Have you noticed your SBUX latte cost?
1798 2018-09-01 14:55:23 Haha what happened?!
1799 2018-09-01 14:54:48 What a great day. Playing TVIX in the first hour and stocks like CRC for the rest of the day has worked out well. Glad to be here.
1800 2018-09-01 14:53:58 I made the mistake of thinking maybe people would start treating the stocks like they represent real companies instead of like bitcoin.
1801 2018-09-01 14:52:49 They used the8 dollar figure as a reference.  He could have placed the 5-6 dollar figure in there.  He is right that we are shrinking stocks year to year even after huge crops.  It will catch up soon.
1802 2018-09-01 14:51:34 s/o to adrian for putting me into these stocks and the gym this 2018. It’s all been worth it.
1803 2018-09-01 14:51:25 Possibly yes. They can use the latest manufacturer’s price list to increase the price of their own stocks, for which they didn’t pay any GST or Sales Tax. In worst cases, traders could wantonly increase price on all goods including those which are exempted...
1804 2018-09-01 14:50:29 La crisis de los lazos amarillos sera ¿ por que los fabricantes de cintas amarillas han terminado los stocks ?, los de la sexta olvidan que se pueden comprar cintas por internet............. fuera de España.
1805 2018-09-01 14:50:29 At end of 2017, Wilshire 5000 only had 3492 stocks. Largest companies buying back more stock than new IPOs coming. Valuation = IRRELEVANT. Supply/Demand. Recession = end of buybacks. THEN down. Just ask all the Elliottwave guys who've been dead wrong and wondering why.
1806 2018-09-01 14:49:27 Looking forward to today’s show. I’m sitting on two stocks that have had 30-50% returns in the past 4 months as I’ve built my pyramid. I’m getting nervous about holding on much longer, and feel tempted to sell, but the trend is still strong for both... (USPH and AMZN)
1807 2018-09-01 14:49:19 My game involves years of waiting, I think a lot of people grow impatient

Gunna make sure I lock in profits with each run (still down from previous buy ins)

So I’m with you. I think we got one or two solid crazy bull runs left before things even out

Then it’ll be like stocks
1808 2018-09-01 14:49:06 Growth stocks have made a tremendous run so I am always a little skeptical when something hasn’t made a mov yet
1809 2018-09-01 14:49:04 Well I was a realtor in Massachusetts for a while which gave me a lot of freedom to learn how to trade as I worked on my own schedule but I still had a broker above me even though I was a subcontractor technically but yes then I learned to trade stocks and crypto and I’m doing it
1810 2018-09-01 14:48:51 At least  food stocks going up
1811 2018-09-01 14:48:23 Just learned my iPhone autocorrects “stoics” to “stocks,” in some kind of depressing statement about our capitalist society
1812 2018-09-01 14:48:14 Amazing how many don't understand 'supply and demand'. Valuation is irrelevant. It's about the amount of money vs amount of stock to buy. Wilshire 5000 as of end 2017 only has 3492 stocks! Companies buying more stock back than new IPOs coming out. ONLY when that reverses = down
1813 2018-09-01 14:48:10 Would initiation of Trump impeachment proceedings hurt Biopharma stocks?
1814 2018-09-01 14:48:04 September has finally arrived and our local malls have started playing Christmas songs and some stores having a sale for old stocks of Christmas decors.

Happy Berrrrr months~

1816 2018-09-01 14:43:54 Hmmmmmm 5 points:
1. Tech stocks doing well in a tech centered ecomomy.
2. "On track" is just a prediction. Not reality.
3. Minimum wage, fast food jobs.
4. Thanks Obama
5. This is vague to the point of being meaningless.

We are resisting a cruel, repulsive, petty, criminal.
1817 2018-09-01 14:43:35 In cases like this I'd be happy to see them put in stocks in the middle of town for a few days. Let them see the disgust of the public.
1818 2018-09-01 14:39:12 I’m pretty much “planted”but trying to keep a little cash.. going back to work part time next week.. more $ to buy stocks but can’t watch markets all day so I’m gonna have to resort to bathroom trading...

1821 2018-09-01 14:38:26 Haha....Similar....I bought ACB at $2.75 and rode it up to $12, thinking I was an absolute boss!  I promptly took my profits and pissed it all away in stupid, poorly thought out, horrible penny stocks. I am much wiser today having had those expensive lessons.
1822 2018-09-01 14:35:39 Strive to select stocks w/ highest caliber at outset w/ goal of minimizing portfolio turnover

Doesn’t mean Buy + Forget

Carefully track execution w/ a critical eye through external checks [not JUST what mgmt SAYS]

Minimizes tax drag 

Increases chances of landing a compounder
1823 2018-09-01 14:33:06 Bob's strategy applies to stocks too. He takes them all the time
1824 2018-09-01 14:31:51 The advice to stay continually invested in stocks is based on US financial history where markets have recovered briskly after downturns. If markets of future don’t repeat their history, this venerated advice isn’t valid.
1825 2018-09-01 14:31:40 That’s not really what she’s saying but we should all note the increase in positive sentiment on TRY, stocks and corporates. Unless something else political happens, markets may sense an opportunity arising from over-panic.
1826 2018-09-01 14:31:16 Rpower was a bubble... But in 2008 all ADAG stocks were doing well fundamentally as well... What they after that is now haunting them now... They got over leveraged entered business contracts that did not make any business sense.

1831 2018-09-01 14:26:52 but if someone tried to steal his stocks (idk if that’s even possible lol) then the gov would have a responsibility to protect his right to own them and would stop the criminal
1832 2018-09-01 14:25:44 The point is that European stocks would fall further and more even in that case

1834 2018-09-01 14:24:59 Nice infomercial you made. Your REAL motivation is to get folks buying stocks so the wealthy can profit from the lift that provides. Unless people work for a small biz they’re unaffected. More helpful TO ALL would be increasing Soc Security, retiree tax breaks or lowering the age
1835 2018-09-01 14:24:57 HAPPY 2018/19 EVERYONE!! How much #corn and #soybeans do we have stateside at this moment? We won't know until the end of the month, but those are the all-important 17/18 ending stocks/beginning stocks for this year. 
1836 2018-09-01 14:20:42 Everyone is telling me my money should be in stocks and forget about crypto. You mean to tell me to go long on a 9 year bull market and completely forget about a market that’s probably found bottom?! 
1837 2018-09-01 14:19:46 I’m being trailed around IKEA and Meadowhall pal... give me a lawn mower any day!

1839 2018-09-01 14:19:04 Satoshi would be rolling in his grave if he thought his Bitcoins would be layered upon with the proliferation of regulated inline-exchange profit-models like this.  This wasn't the intent for Bitcoin.  It could just as easily be gold, or stocks, underlying the transactions.
1840 2018-09-01 14:18:26 Pablo, Bob Dunn is a great mentor, I learned a lot from him. I ended up moving to stocks to manage risk better. I do plan on going back to the futures at some point. If you haven't checked out @thechartist, I highly recommend him, he has made me consistently profitable
1841 2018-09-01 14:18:07 A lot of the leading stocks are very extended so not posting everything but will throw out a few still in range
1842 2018-09-01 14:17:42 Market rising really doesn't affect us much, including your 401k, as fluctuation in indivudual stocks will always be factor. We've had a bull market for years now with 83% of the gains occurring under Obama, so again, on the same trajectory.
Trump walked into this.
1843 2018-09-01 14:16:49 Tweet 1 of 2: Management’s response will be critical in the coming weeks. How they respond to this will impact the stock permanently. I believe the following response would eliminate permanent damage from the stock:

1. Continuing with Long Bets in Century Tex with 950 as fresh trail SL & TGT 1030-1050

5. PSU Power stocks like REC & Power Grid looks Good for short term.

1852 2018-09-01 14:13:05 Go to some of TRUMP states, highest welfare recipients, those struggling, they don't have stocks, 401k, they are forced for food banks, meals for kids being sent home from schools. Worst education system. They need a step up not more steped upon!
1853 2018-09-01 14:12:24 Also the best part about MF is that there are fund managers who continuously monitor the markets and each stock in their portfolio. So you won't have to worry about monitoring individual stocks and market trends on a constant basis.
1854 2018-09-01 14:12:12 So basically they went public earlier this year and they have been buzzing in the stocks. They released new partnerships with Struggling Hulu and others. Lastly, they want to get into making there own speakers or form a partnership with an audio manufacturer and I support it all!

1902 2018-09-01 13:41:31 Hey! I appreciate your question. The book is still relevant today. It's a road map to long term investing and the psychology behind long term gain from investing in stocks! As long as there's a stock market, it's relevant!
1903 2018-09-01 13:41:12 Should ask many bull pundits this. No one in the permabull crowd pays the slightest attention to what individual stocks and sectors are communicating.  
The intellectual dishonesty......

1906 2018-09-01 13:36:04 With the exception of maybe J. Cole (he is respected by a lot of rap fans but he's also the butt of a lot of jokes from many rap fans too), all the rappers mentioned in the tweet are laughing stocks of the rap game, way more than Mac Miller who I don't see that much hate for.

1915 2018-09-01 13:30:23 No, she should not be in jail. She should be tried and fined, sentenced to a week in the stocks at a public location, then flogged. Jails and prisons are schools for crime and a great unnecessary expense. Inflict some bodily pain and embarrassment!
1916 2018-09-01 13:30:19 How as the economy slowed? Unless you use CNN mentality the growth of 4.2 is amazing and the stocks are indicative of the economy when you dissect the various sectors so what you say about stock not connected to economy is foolish. 

I guess you love entitlements and taxation

1936 2018-09-01 13:08:12 The French scallop fishers should be protected by the French navy as they seek to protect their fish stocks. UK fishermen should be observing all best practice in marine conservation, not trying to hoover up stocks to which they will have no access next season. #bbcaq

1952 2018-09-01 12:55:29 Apr #StrayReflections: "Now that stock markets around the world have witnessed a sharp correction and the prospect of trade wars has caught investors’ attention, we think the incredible bull run in stocks will continue." $SPY

1954 2018-09-01 12:54:04 Staggering ignorance from @HelenGrantMP on the scallop clash.
Apparently when we leave the EU, 'we'll take back control". Of EU waters? I don't think so.
And the fishing policy has achieved nothing? Just the recovery of our fish stocks.
If you don't know, say so.
1955 2018-09-01 12:52:42 Those articles *do not* rifute the XX and XY binary of biological sex. They just don't. And for good reason, because otherwise those journals would make themselves laughing stocks.
1956 2018-09-01 12:51:40 @fathernice11 "Trading stocks, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t.  Always something new to learn." --> Have you tried closed end funds?
1957 2018-09-01 12:51:28 Je suis tenté de prendre ma valise taille M pour 3jrs comme ça je l’a rempli de paquets d’algues coréenne pr renflouer mes stocks 
1958 2018-09-01 12:51:22 Does she even know that scallop fishing isn't overseen by the EU? #bbcaq Seems it needs to be if British sorts who don't care about conserving stocks won't play nicely.
1959 2018-09-01 12:50:46 Dividend stocks tempt me for this reason. So far, I'm sticking with accumulation funds.  Its cool to see their value increase, but I think having pounds paid back to you would be even better!
1960 2018-09-01 12:50:00 One thing that it might be: stocks vs. flows. We are at 1/3 women in econ students, now. Women overproportionally decide to leave academia for administration/institutions. So today‘s flow is 1/5. If the flow 25 years ago was half of that you are roughly there. More senior = older
1961 2018-09-01 12:49:46 They’re still prospects though...like stocks in the market if you catch my drift
1962 2018-09-01 12:49:39 Too much of this disrespect from people now. Time to stop the softly softly approach. Bring back town stocks let public dish out punishment
1963 2018-09-01 12:48:11 Powell has ramped up the reversal. I & many others on Wall St anticipated MAJOR problems for the market, potentially even a crash as a result of this, yet stocks are at new ATHs. Fed is raising rates AND draining debt from the system - this has never been attempted at this scale.
1964 2018-09-01 12:47:17 Trump still around? Are we going to hear all the bickering and crying for another six more years? Instead of actually doing something productive, let’s all just cry. Buy stocks in napkin companies because we are about to run out 
1965 2018-09-01 12:47:11 Would we have any cod at all, if it weren't for recovery of stocks under EU policy? #bbcaq

1968 2018-09-01 12:45:13 No. I'm saying that his policies aren't affecting the economy. Stock buybacks are at the highest levels since a decade ago, meaning companies repatriate foreign profits to buy back stocks, not raising wages or investing the economy.

1973 2018-09-01 12:42:49 Usually when you’re on a big show you place a certain percentage of your earnings in stocks or mutual funds so they grow over time. Howard Jones was a popular musician in the 80s. He was frugal with his $$ and hasn’t had a pop hit in 30 years and is still very well off. No excuse

2061 2018-09-01 10:41:09 I'm with the French over the 'Scallop wars', Stocks should be allowed to recover. What is the point of the French looking after our future food if the British are going to destroy it? As a Brit, I'm embarrassed by this.

2063 2018-09-01 10:40:19 Pensar que la FANB no tiene capacidad de combate es un error. Y mayor error aún es pensar que ante el colapso del Estado venezolano por el conflicto se restablecerá el orden en un país lleno de facciones militares, colectivos y narcos que tendrán acceso a stocks de la FANB.

2071 2018-09-01 10:34:09 @realDonaldTrump Why is the crooked Federal Reserve continuing to print money and feed it to the Central banks so they can keep the stocks, bonds and derivatives markets at an all time high.  Continuing the 2008 bank bail out?
2072 2018-09-01 10:32:38 Why don’t you use the money you got by insider trading when you were found guilty of violating the stck act by using government info to buy stocks illegally
2073 2018-09-01 10:31:44 That was my instant thought to. Its a blatant contradiction. But flaunting continual contradictions and dictating lies are true are standard abuser tactics. Thats what this is, plus a threat - same as threats of violence if regime is prosecuted, or his threats stocks will plunge

Remember that stocks are never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling
2118 2018-09-01 09:21:44 In digital era data is the new gold. Make sure your data about your customers, suppliers, stocks, products and financial transactions are complete, accurate and up to date.
2119 2018-09-01 09:19:37 Let’s just put him in the stocks. It’s a joke @Jack , it’s just a silly joke.
2120 2018-09-01 09:18:59 My point is all these statistics with the market don’t always translate into higher economic growth like Trump conveniently brags about. Wall Street is not Main Street. Stocks are heavily favored to corporate America not middle class Americans.  It is a very practical opinion
2121 2018-09-01 09:18:37 Hahaha you wish the democrats are actually OUT OF CONTROL over this it is an obsession with them,what I don't understand is if you work the stock market like you say you do I would think that you would be very happy knowing that stocks are up,when was the last time a democrat
2122 2018-09-01 09:17:43 Well, played Smash with my college's Smash group and got to know them. We also did crew battles and I did extremely well by taking 12 stocks without losing a stock (until their last player). All and all I'm very happy
2123 2018-09-01 09:16:00 Thanks, Susan.  I actually already receive a livable wage ($15ish/hr) and full benefits.  We also get stocks in the co and monthly bonuses.

2126 2018-09-01 09:12:39 When the share moves against you and the fundamentals have NOT changed, you have three options:

1. Average down
2. Sell at a loss and buy lower (not advisable)
3. Hold and buy other stocks to make profits

When the fundamentals change, selling is better than waiting for change.

2138 2018-09-01 08:59:53 I think one of the sentences Dump should get, after being impeached, indicted, tried, & convicted is to have to list and apologize publicly for every single lie he told the American people. I know it will take a long time, but he’ll also be restrained in stocks.

2140 2018-09-01 08:57:01 I get the feeling some folk want him in stocks and beaten out of town. This is 2018 not 1018.

2141 2018-09-01 08:56:00 IDK.  I'm sure he's talked to someone.  I've read the articles on social media about the varying conditions; I was shocked.  My FC is nothing like they've described.  I make about $15/hr, full benefits, bonuses, stocks, opportunities to move up.  Supportive coworkers/managers.
2142 2018-09-01 08:55:07 The narrowness of this market that brought the market to record highs on January is getting even narrower with much smaller percentage of stocks responsible for this new record highs on sp500..N this narrowness will eventually bring indices down to its knees..
2143 2018-09-01 08:54:58 If english boats were voluntarily leaving one of our south coast ports alone to let stocks recover, and then the french came along to fish it out, would we seriously think it appropriate for the French navy to rock up to help them 'because its legal'?

2173 2018-09-01 08:14:04 A question for the clan..

When swing trading, do you enter trades and use daily candles only? 

Or do you also watch intraday activity closely? 

What is the best way to set effective stop losses on options if not baby sitting the stocks?
2174 2018-09-01 08:13:45 It is because they are obtaining cheaper export refinance here and investing in stocks and real estate;few also invest in India and Bangladesh. Personal interests win over national interests.

2198 2018-09-01 07:43:10 They may also be aware central banks are now the biggest investors in the markets. They print money to buy stocks so are artificially inflated (Fang stocks in particular). When they sell up to relieve the balance sheets the great stock unwind will commence.

2202 2018-09-01 07:36:00 Our entry level rate starts at $13.25 right now, vs state min which is like $11.50.  BUT, FT also gets a monthly bonus and benefits that are effective the first day.  PLUS, stocks in the Co that vest every 2 years.

2226 2018-09-01 07:10:52 I've worked at Amazon for over a year and am not on any type of state assistance.  As a FT associate, I make right around $15+OT/bonuses/stocks.  Our benefits package is very affordable too!
2227 2018-09-01 07:09:42 What's an investment bag?  Is it a fancy name for a portfolio of stocks?
2228 2018-09-01 07:05:33 Hi Dom, I focus on stocks but at AOT we work in a "community" type environment so I encourage options traders to share their trades and share with everyone how they are structuring their options trades once I issue out trades and/or setups. That's why more than 1/2 trade options
2229 2018-09-01 07:01:29 Thans Sir for reply...

2234 2018-09-01 06:52:55 Hi Dave, great view as usual. Though when i look at the individual tech stocks like AAPL, AMZN..etc, i hv a feeling they will consolidate to new high in Sept before something breaks in Oct. So im looking for a top during mid-late Sept window
2235 2018-09-01 06:51:52 FAANG is an acronym for the market's top-performing performing tech stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet's Google. It was originally FANG when CNBC's Jim Cramer first coined the term as it did not include Apple.
2236 2018-09-01 06:50:46 sana meron pa silang stocks nito by october 
2237 2018-09-01 06:48:37 Doc, I said nothing unfair here. Both points made are factual.

I made no reference to whether you held shares or not at the time of the podcasts.

It’s more a question of why you continue to promote certain stocks that are complete dogs like #PCGE & #AGQ for example.

2241 2018-09-01 06:40:44 In science, we call that an anecdote. Using the stock market example, the fact that stocks were down last month or last year, does not mean it is not a bull market. We look at pattern in science and in stocks. The pattern as the graph shows is that of a warming earth.
2242 2018-09-01 06:38:18 So, the larger establishment will have the hedging advantage. So they continue to exhibit low pricing until SST stocks come in. By then, the increase is not too obvious because they are known to be “cheap”.

2. Ownership(like myself) did not see a future w/Amber Stocks

2308 2018-09-01 04:48:43 This is why active managers don’t faithfully dispense their fiduciary duty which caused proliferation of passive funds in USA. They accept money when they should be returning money and they put money in same stocks which everyone and their mother are buying.

But if you overpay at the top of a bull market, your future returns on stocks will probably be poor.
2319 2018-09-01 04:34:27 It's on NIFTY 50 Stock Futures. Stop is always 1% and Targets ranges from 1-1.5-2%. I don't think it's easily possible to target over that in Intraday for NIFTY 50 Stocks that are largest of large caps.
2320 2018-09-01 04:33:33 And how many regular, everyday, hard working people have stocks? Wages haven’t gone up but cost of living has! Middle to lower income people are just fighting to make ends meet! So NO, no further questions-just facts & reality

2322 2018-09-01 04:29:04 Just look at all the stocks he crashed via tweet. You know he went in and bought low before he started praising the companies to raise value.
2323 2018-09-01 04:28:29 Does anyone get the feeling we are not far off approaching peak bubble in tech stocks ?
2324 2018-09-01 04:28:16 It also shows the value of proactive planning by domestic end users who have managed drought risk through owning domestic stocks. More accurate domestic stocks reporting (and greater understanding of how to manage risk) would greatly assist others to take similar action.

2331 2018-09-01 04:18:52 If I remember right: Allan Mecham, Arlington Value hedge fund does the same technique, instead of buy & hold. Does it very often on his PF stocks within his Circle of Competency stocks.

2333 2018-09-01 04:15:23 Q: Sir, IMHO: what if the profit on those txns are greater than stock's movement over same period? V can only discuss, if 1ly net returns after Txn charges r lower than stocks return if bought & held all thru. 
with so much volatility v cant assume 1ly buy & hold gives alpha.
2334 2018-09-01 04:13:37 MOST brought their stock. How does a one time $2K bonus do for you? It's a bonus and taxed higher. Why not give raises and more benefits? Hmm..likely the common folks this was slated to help, don't even own stocks. Do you own stocks?  Did you get more dividends?

2363 2018-09-01 03:45:06 That’s what happens when they mess with conservatives! Just ask FB stocks!
2364 2018-09-01 03:42:33 Stocks go down and no one becomes richer, but when stocks go up (make more rich people), most of that new wealth is going only to a few people. That is causing fewer and fewer people to become rich over time

2370 2018-09-01 03:37:04 Instead of watching the stock market daily, I think it's time to invest in some stocks. 
2371 2018-09-01 03:35:54 And The Love is reciprocated back.  Who do I have to call to get that feature on Minnesota’s chances?  Ok that’s not fair to Harbaugh.
2372 2018-09-01 03:35:46 You're absolutely so right about #China Senator! The 99% of China's companies LIE about their books to get going public to get the FREE capital! The US should ban Chinese biz listing on our stock market. As investors, DO NOT BUY STOCKS THAT'RE FROM A CHINESE COMPANY!
2373 2018-09-01 03:34:47 That's the name of the game pal and that's why I hunt these #BottomFishing #ChartPicks down every couple of weeks.. Bring them on, it's easier when there is more than one pair of eyes and I'm sure there are more #Crypto stocks out there that aren't on my #CryptoStockList. 
2374 2018-09-01 03:34:14 Part of risk management is weighing all the scenarios, including the negative ones. The risk of keeping Donaldson through this year included a) either his performance tanks, or b) he gets injured.  Glad these guys don't manage my stocks.

Tcw is service but at 800m valuation and 10%, soon to be 15 fcf yield, them buying back ~ like 10% of float per year seems like a no brainer , i think they will probably outperform all stocks discussed above.

2422 2018-09-01 02:51:27 Multiple issues here 1) it’s a bad idea 2) don’t be hypocritical...if you were for the fairness doctrine, you can’t be against this 3) market cap of FANG stocks makes them deserving of investigation into potential breakup a la at&t.

2428 2018-09-01 02:45:37 Well it started.

2438 2018-09-01 02:36:01 @notthefakeSVP curious as to when you’re going to have that 1 on 1 convo with Paul Chryst?  You know because Michigan and Harbaugh have definitely earned the right to have that conversation.  What’s their goal his year 3 losses?
2439 2018-09-01 02:35:25 The stock market means ALL to that 36% who support the orange lard bucket. As long as their stocks are going up, the hell with everything else. It's plain as day.

2441 2018-09-01 02:34:30 Something is holding these stocks back...not exactly sure what.  But, sticking with them.  As you said, fundamentals are strong so downside should be limited.  Hopefully some upside presents itself soon.  Hard to tell with this being Sept and potential sell off in the cards.

2444 2018-09-01 02:30:02 Fell in love with the stock market 45 years ago in jr high school.  Have tried many approaches since.  Investing in dividend stocks has worked the best.  Having a Roth IRA clinched it.

2478 2018-09-01 01:46:09 @lewisbloomNHRA I went to the U. S. Nationals in 1962. It was the 1st year for the Indy track and there were so many cars there, they had to use the parking lot of a new shopping center to inspect the stockers. Speaking of stocks how about the 171 car count at Indy this year!

2483 2018-09-01 01:39:21 I consider corporate donations to politicians to be bribes and the Supreme Court gave them the green light.  Why do you think insurance companies stocks went up when Obamacare passed?  Because they wrote the legislation.  Plenty of greasy palms in DC.
2484 2018-09-01 01:39:21 I make $48K a year. And I have a 401K. There are stocks in said 401K. Does that make me an evil shareholder?
2485 2018-09-01 01:37:47 I’d ask why your not long but realized you don’t have to actually buy stocks to sell subscriptions. 
2486 2018-09-01 01:37:37 @DaveRieff There is nothing like the U. S. Nationals. 171 stocks and 172 super stocks.

2496 2018-09-01 01:27:47 It's not whether market news or figures are good or bad; it is simply how much they vary from the prevailing expectation at a given moment that moves market prices. Unemployment could be 2% but if conventional wisdom had predicted 1.7%, Stocks could drop in disappointment.

2508 2018-09-01 01:14:47 You may have noticed companies buying back their stocks? Exactly what Democrats said would happen when they got their large tax breaks. Wages meanwhile have remained stagnant or gone up so little that they fall behind the cost of living. You are right Ron.

2513 2018-09-01 01:11:01 A ban on bump stocks doesn't prevent all shootings, true. But let's be honest and admit it would cut down on the horrifying number of casualties in mass shootings on a scale like we saw in Vegas. Please stop putting the profits of gun manufacturers ahead of public health.
2514 2018-09-01 01:10:07 E. All of the above and an extended period of time in the stocks (yes, like in Colonial times). $1 per vegetable thrown, $2 for canned veggies.
2515 2018-09-01 01:09:57 hi amber stocks
2516 2018-09-01 01:09:16 Not bullish on stocks means he won't take the time to learn your name.
2517 2018-09-01 01:08:37 But what I was gonna say <@!251169535489605632> was all these rising wedges are usually bearish, and if you’ve traded stocks at all recently you’d be joining the $“TA is useless” team 
2518 2018-09-01 01:07:16 Wow stocks fired

2526 2018-09-01 00:52:38 Their record reflected the 3-4 games they blew when they didn't have proper Coaching...
Games got close. Stocks bucked them eyes and let lead after lead fade away.
They cudda used Jessica Breland's defense and clutch scoring.
They cudda used LESS Stephanie Dolson...
2527 2018-09-01 00:50:14 So pumped that @Dymocksbooks stocks Anarchy by @MeganDeVosBooks! I can’t wait to go get a copy or three
2528 2018-09-01 00:49:27 Which stocks
2529 2018-09-01 00:48:50 I agree 1000%
Amber Stocks in-game Coaching was horrid.
She played Dolson over 
Coates and Parker. And they never got a chance to flourish.
#Sky will move forward w/a Coach, better with the x & o's.
I recommend @NancyLieberman for the job!

- #SB1346 to ban bump stocks passed

2533 2018-09-01 00:45:07 I agree w/@MechelleV 1,000 %
Stocks played Dolson when she was obviously not in shape & ineffective.
by playing Dolson, she didn't allow Coates/Parker's games to flourish.
She let Breland walk when Sky desperately needed a PF
who could defend & score.
& her in-game Coaching stunk
2534 2018-09-01 00:44:40 Economy has been great and taxes cut to where i was able to buy a summer home in Maine and vacation in Italy all last month.  By midterms i will expand sales and operations by 6 more making 2018-2019 even more profitable after 8 years of flat line. 
Stocks went up 12%.

2541 2018-09-01 00:37:38 I kinda agree. I didn't think Stocks was a bad coach but I do remember a game this past season where the team quit on her. But I'm still surprised.

Would she have retained her job if she landed the 1st pick?

2552 2018-09-01 00:27:47 I’m investing in Asian stocks.
Every time Trump bashes China, it’s a gift.
I think Trump will cut a deal with China.
Then you’ll get a fantastic rally out of the Asian stock markets.

2555 2018-09-01 00:21:36 It's not really about one person owning a few stocks, it's more about the wealth gap in America. When republicans claim the economy is booming that doesn't really help middle America or the poor. Real wages have actually decreased vs. inflation since Trump's tax cuts.
2556 2018-09-01 00:20:38 Because Iran invested in American stocks, and they were frozen. That was the amount they were owed. Oh, who broke the accord? Trump, Should Iran resume nuclear ambitions, I would, if I were them.

2565 2018-09-01 00:12:29 $tsla a short thanks to Elon and the famous #fundingsecured short till some big sales numbers come out then it squeeze to $350+...once the pumpers go to hiding stocks a buy...till then short short short
2566 2018-09-01 00:07:54 It’s uncommitted cash that you can use to buy more stocks, bonds, etc.
2567 2018-09-01 00:07:34 Don't know what the pros say but personally I'd rather see fewer new highs, makes it easier to find leading stocks.
2568 2018-09-01 00:07:08 So for May 2019, babe and I are each gonna sell one of our stocks, use that money to ball out in Vegas and then after EDC fly to Anaheim for 2/3 days in Disneyland  IT’S LITTY TITTY FAM
2569 2018-09-01 00:05:07 There is no sense in arguing from emotions! There is all sense in owning a rifle that can protect you from criminals or anyone who wants to hurt your family. How will banning bump stocks and all that end gun violence when most people are shot by criminals using hand guns?
2570 2018-09-01 00:02:24 I like my stocks going up and a fatter paycheck-for me.  More than I need a President to smooth talk our way into funding terrorists and making open book test agreements we can’t enforce. Socialism sucks so bad, but u guys aren’t learning from Venezuela.
2571 2018-09-01 00:01:42 I dont know how long we can hold out! We are down to less than a half bottle of prosseco left, gin stocks are now being heavily attacked. These attacks have become bogged down now that cheese on toast is being deployed. We are all out of quiche. The humanity! #SNPCivilWar
2572 2018-09-01 00:01:20 Stocks Are Science Not Gambling !
2573 2018-09-01 00:01:17 I’m highly thinking of shorting stock if it goes any higher , big probability it can’t sustain or increase much more then this... can it  don’t get me wrong I hope it keeps going up as all other weed stocks increase . But a correction is evident
2574 2018-09-01 00:01:00 Like the 1.5T big cooperations (Welfare Queens) took from the American poeple and promise pay raises but only buy back there only stocks to inflate there own companies?
2575 2018-09-01 00:00:39 Over half of America is involved in stocks and it is a predictor of how the economy is doing.

2578 2018-08-31 23:55:58 Parish crash? Did they have stocks and shares in the Church? Are you proposing a Godfather 3 style conspiracy involving the Catholic Church?
2579 2018-08-31 23:54:21 Exactly. There is more than financial success that is important to people. Healthcare, affordable housing, environment...not just stocks which most Americans aren’t involved in anyway.
2580 2018-08-31 23:52:46 The Richest 10% of Americans Own 84% of All Stocks.

2582 2018-08-31 23:52:15 I understand your logic buddy, but that applies to stocks only. This is crypto, it will go nuts soon, in 2020 it will either be over 100K or 0. I believe it will be over 100K
2583 2018-08-31 23:51:15 Why are those people that said they would go to Canada if Trump wins the White House still here and trading stocks? Bragging about their stocks and acting like how smart they are. You should be up in Canada.
2584 2018-08-31 23:50:07 Because it's false growth! Central banks around the world are PRINTING money and buying FAANG stocks and a handful of others. The entire market is a massive bubble.
2585 2018-08-31 23:50:03 I mean was China NOT AAPL's biggest future growth engine? Wasn't Pres. Trump supposed to favor Oil/GAS/Infrastructure stocks and shun tech? Now Timmy and Trump are Brohiems and China trade issues DON'T worry AAPL investors ...Yet MOVIE STOCKS SELL OFF?

2588 2018-08-31 23:47:46 Have you re assessed the gold price as only a month  ago you spoke of a new bull market in gold? Gold stocks will capitulate at $850

2616 2018-08-31 23:38:07 “Bill”, everything you wrote is not true. There has been no wage growth under Trump. The only business investment is buy backs of Corp. stocks, followed by layoffs. Check the REAL facts.
2617 2018-08-31 23:37:00 Mostly I have done Short Strangles with High IV stocks. Sent you the PM with details. Infact your last year webinar was an eye opener and after successful completion of @SantoshPasi workshop I started making 3 to 5% consistent profit.
2618 2018-08-31 23:34:58 If it hasn't been costed how do you know it's a problem?
Embodied CO2 in wind turbines and solar panels is offset within months.
Yes, mining is required to make batteries - same is true of fossil fuel and nuclear power stations - but none is needed for renewable fuel stocks.
2619 2018-08-31 23:34:09 (manipulating stocks to bankrupt microsoft) this is lit as hell
2620 2018-08-31 23:33:33 Is 4.2% GDP a record? The Stock Market is not relevant to the majority of Americans, less than 50% own stocks, do you really care about African American employment? I think not.
2621 2018-08-31 23:32:26 Reports of an outbreak of #SNPCivilWar in West Edinburgh proved false - a corner shop with stocks of 38% Irn Bru was the scene of a ramraid by local neds

2635 2018-08-31 23:23:00 We just had had to switch from an in-home daycare that charged $30 a day to one that is $20k a year. In other news, I will be living on baked beans and ramen and am trying to pay my students loans each month via profits from day trading Canadian weed stocks. AMA
2636 2018-08-31 23:22:29 I’m all about those volatile cannabis stocks. Pro tip: @sprint is actually a good buy anywhere below $6.5. Pending merger 9.5 shares will turn into 1 TMUS share. If today’s values hold at my purchase rate of 6.30 I’ll have about 5 shares for 6 less a piece.

2638 2018-08-31 23:20:59 Look stocks with market cap >80M. Uranium Penny stocks in general are shit.

The best strategy is buy American producers like Fuels, UR or Peninsula that can rise production in months with good contracts. Add some Canadian explorers, my favorite are Denison and Nexgen.
2639 2018-08-31 23:20:21 Maybe more for the stocks but ehhhhh its pretty good. Just dont blow all of it is the best idea.

2642 2018-08-31 23:18:35 Because money that use to be paid by the 1% have been cut. What you are seeing is a booming economy that cannot keep up with spending. The spending outweighs the money coming in. And all the companies are doing is buying stocks and reinvesting.
2643 2018-08-31 23:17:30 Printed n BIG BOLD BLACK LETTERS. GET THIS TEAM INTO PLAYOFFS OR U FIRED, MRS. AMBER STOCKS/COACH AND GM.
2644 2018-08-31 23:17:11 No.  I was joking. 
These stocks are all ridiculously overbought. IMO.

Good companies.
2645 2018-08-31 23:17:03 Jerome, just out of curiosity what stocks do you own?
2646 2018-08-31 23:14:48 You made it so companies can gamble larger amounts of people's retirement. If the company loses it in stocks, they are under no obligation to pay out. Many just claim it and pocket it. More shady business practices from the king of con.
2647 2018-08-31 23:13:06 It's like everything liberals do. Look at Dicks Sporting goods.  They got rid of guns & now their stocks are worthless because nobody shops there anymore.
2648 2018-08-31 23:12:57 You can choose the stocks for each character
2649 2018-08-31 23:12:24 I bet Cheshire stores only stocks the £20 ones tbf
2650 2018-08-31 23:11:00 Oh fuck knows what that nasty little man has in store. He'd bring back the stocks I'm sure. Teachers would be encouraged to use the tawse or cane. The poor would be papped in workhouses.
2651 2018-08-31 23:10:40 Man I really fucked up selling stocks too early 
2652 2018-08-31 23:09:23 First time ko mamalengke ng mag isa. Goodluck to me  buti nalang hindi stocks sa bahay yung bibilin ko wahaha
2653 2018-08-31 23:08:47 If you look at the valuation of financial assets - stocks and bonds are discounting totally different outcomes. Bonds are acting like long term growth and inflation will be modest. The stock market needs strong growth to stay highly valued. Worldwide debt levels are too high.
2654 2018-08-31 23:08:05 Aside from jon saying that, I see no actual confirmation. Hell, the podcast guy even said you can set the stocks for each character.
2655 2018-08-31 23:07:43 September is upon us tomorrow. You know what that means?? #MJ #stocks season with #FarmBill2018 approaching!! & guess what? $GRPS .007 announces stake of a Hemp Cultivation a few weeks back with already $2m in orders. Same CEO as $POTN (.008-$1) and same AS too! #yuuuge. All imo
2656 2018-08-31 23:07:33 Catherine just made the current rules up without notice and comment. Hell even the ATF had to complete notice and comment before trying to ban bump stocks.  The Federal Courts don't seem to share your point of view.
2657 2018-08-31 23:06:53 I’d go further: don’t take loans to invest in any asset class as purely an investment. Ever. Period. 

Gold? No!
Stocks? No!
Futures? No!
Shitcoins? AYFKM?!

Unless it’s a house you are going to live in for 10+ years or a car to get you to work don’t take a f’ing loan.

2660 2018-08-31 23:05:41 The Target site just seems to always be a disaster in my experience. Their stocks never seem to be accurate for the entire site or local stocks. I got the exclusive Ian Malcom Pop in store when it said it was completely out of stock. Same story with the Rex.

2665 2018-08-31 23:01:55 What?..Don't you guys literally blow your mind when a Spanish fishing boat slings by the bay?  Maybe these French guys feel the same way about British trawlers DREDGING off the Normandy sea bed when they've been told to stop to allow stocks to recover?  Sound at all familiar?
2666 2018-08-31 23:00:48 @Amber_Stocks had nothing last yr inheriting a .500 team With EDD in ‘16. Drafted well & played 2 fine rookies this yr. Emphasis on rookies.
By any reasonable analysis Coach Stocks was not given enough time to be successful. Bear this in mind anyone interviewing for Sky HC.

2667 2018-08-31 22:59:30 He has a swing trading strategy (ie holding stocks for multiple days), so you can apply the strategy while you work your full-time job instead of a day trading strategy where you would have to spend hours watching the markets - @super_trades is legit!
2668 2018-08-31 22:59:10 I agree
2669 2018-08-31 22:58:44 Nick Barr just dm me he said he talked to Elon Musk and there’s an internship open for me with Tesla I just have to Venmo him 5 grand to invest in company stocks
2670 2018-08-31 22:56:26 Worker’s wages on average are -9% growth since 2006.  430+ billion in Q2 in corporate profits have been used to buy back stocks, to the benefit of execs and shareholders...220+ billion in Q2...
2671 2018-08-31 22:55:13 The recent tax breaks went to buying back stocks - inflating the value of the stock so shareholders can make (and claim) profit.  No expansions or growth of companies because the demand for it isn't there, no new jobs, no paying workers more, just the rich playing with themselves
2672 2018-08-31 22:54:45 Great #stocks of #growthmindset #companies #WY #NTR #MDR..... #agriculture #Energy #oil #NatGas #timberlands #Commodities
2673 2018-08-31 22:54:09 Actually tax & regulation cuts help all people that work for a living. My stocks have been phenomenal and I just rec’d my 1st significant raise & bonus in years. FYI, I’m not a corporation. Company’s/small business can finally hire again! Leave your echo chamber and  the #’s
2674 2018-08-31 22:53:56 Time to sell my stocks before they become another Sears
2675 2018-08-31 22:51:28 I want to as soon as I get my stocks lol
2676 2018-08-31 22:51:03 It’s normal for stocks to fluctuate.

2679 2018-08-31 22:46:46 Nope, never around 50.  More like late 30's at most.  I agree that certain stocks do perform well in the long-term if you invest in your early 20's.
2680 2018-08-31 22:45:24 gotta give stocks month/years bro mainly years
2681 2018-08-31 22:45:23 In my trading pot I own around 50 different stocks.  Moving around as the tides roll in and out.

Its a great way for me to stay engaged with the whole market yet detached.

I've learned a lot and still have much to learn.

2684 2018-08-31 22:40:13 Sorry, 401k and pensions. Every public teacher and public employee in America has a pension and they’re mostly all invested in stocks. It’s still about 80% of working Americans that own some stock.
2685 2018-08-31 22:40:13 Amber Stocks had wrong matchups n starting 5 against other team lineups. I think Veteran Coach will change the starting line-up based upon opponents line-ups. That's the first move. Second Deshields will have the green light to shoot or create her offense and it will run thru her
2686 2018-08-31 22:40:03 Although I agree that everyone should learn to play both sides, the best trader that I know plays strictly bullish. He finds the most bullish market weather it be stocks, forex, or crypto and trades it. Its all about what suits your style.
2687 2018-08-31 22:39:00 I have mixed emotions on Scott, he placated the left by banning bump stocks as well as raising the age to purchase a rifle to 21...... Neither of those laws will stop mass shootings from taking place. However allowing non felon adults to carry without a permit is a solution.
2688 2018-08-31 22:38:43 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Jim, counter to conventional wisdom, the more money you have in retirement, the less meaningful a losswill have in a downturn. I am 100% in stocks, mostly established dividend payers, and way out-perform a 60-40 portfolio. I am 73 and don’t feel vulnerable at all.
2689 2018-08-31 22:36:32 tl;dr doesn't this ultimately translate to low P/E and EV/EBIT(DA) multiples? the first factor is also boosted by low ROE.... so is the takeaway that a basket of deep value stocks outperforms mkt?
2690 2018-08-31 22:35:05 Well, Laimbeer will make it happen this year. Sky truly has no use for Coates with Parker/Dolson and others on that team. Coates average 3-5 minutes a game under Amber Stocks and Coates own play n that system was bad. She never truly was able to showcase her rebounding skills.
2691 2018-08-31 22:34:44 Nice. It’s funny how 4.20 is a significant level for most pot stocks.

2699 2018-08-31 22:28:17 One idea I had was put a gentleman's clause on Squad Strike, so both players have to agree to play it in a set. Assuming we use 3 stocks of course (or 5, although that's pretty unlikely). If we use some other number this whole thing is thrown out the window. :P

2702 2018-08-31 22:21:23 Calling the bottom or a bounce?

I like the set up, but also think that any huge move up in PMs will be be preceded by a historic move up, then down, in fiat assets... R > F one day.

Not sure this happens with PMs not destroyed, real yields fine, stocks near ATHs..
2703 2018-08-31 22:20:27 You crazy!! Let’s talk about how President Trump has helped the American people. Jobs, money and corps moving back to America, strengthening our military, more ppl off food stamps , rise in stocks, jobs opening up from Hussein regulations.  Are you kidding me ?
2704 2018-08-31 22:19:08 Butt stocks, silencers, etc.  But even decent engineers with a printer or fabrication equipment can made crude weapons.  There's no simple answer but there needs to be a rational start.

2707 2018-08-31 22:16:43 True. But the price is still the price. And I would also say there are a lot of strong stocks in this ETF besides $AMZN. Plus, you could say the same thing about many "index" ETFs, having skewed weightings to 1 stock. $XOM is 22% of $XLE.

2712 2018-08-31 22:12:45 This kind of trading is likely to be substantially similar to penny stocks/pink sheets compared to blockchain-enabled equity-based securities.  Surprising to me the amount of investment in OTC trading platforms for altcoins.
2713 2018-08-31 22:12:23 Clueless. 80% of Americans have a 401K. They consist of stocks. Every middle class paycheck in America is bigger. You dont have a choice because it’s a tax reform. Nice try though.

2717 2018-08-31 22:09:44 I’ve been continually baffled how they manage to price their comics so low. Even with non-gloss paper stock, the conventional wisdom has been that having covers and interiors of two different paper stocks actually increases the cost per unit because you need two machines.

2726 2018-08-31 22:04:29 backup Center due to the fact she is prone to fouls. Also though she is 6'5 and wide, she cannot out rebound bigs at the center position so Parker should have been the starting center this season. Stocks entire starting 5 was at a mismatch that lead to a lot of losses for the Sky

2734 2018-08-31 21:51:29 I don’t spend more than I make and our government shouldn’t either. What happened to Republicans who were deficit hawks? Corporations used the tax breaks to buy back stocks and reward senior management. Wages are stagnant. Trickle down economics never works.
2735 2018-08-31 21:50:07 A growing economy needs a growing supply of money. Yes, spending too much can be inflationary, but that’s not limited to just government spending. Even private spending can be inflationary, like now with stocks & real-estate. Those are asset inflation caused by private spending.

2739 2018-08-31 21:48:02 I liked Stocks too. At least 1 more year or half year would’ve felt right for me.

I think they want to get to the playoffs. I think we’re going all Vet everything. Vet coach, vets in free agency, maybe even trading the pick for a vet. It’s playoffs or bust right now I think.
2740 2018-08-31 21:48:00 Some thought about news/social media discussion on stocks: I used to believe that media discussion about stocks is useless because the future is so unpredictable. Well, it depends. If your goal is to get a hot tip on what to buy and make a quick profit, good luck with that.
2741 2018-08-31 21:46:29 Wait. I think our banks will be part and parcel of the equation. USA banks are disallowed in Canada. I hear it's among contentious issues. Get Manhattan Chase in Canada & see what happens to Canadian bank stocks.

2748 2018-08-31 21:43:20 I think September will be ugly for stocks
2749 2018-08-31 21:42:59 I think you guys are missing g the point. Trump gave huge tax cuts to billionaires, who did NOT put it towards wages, they put it towards their stocks, enriching themselves. Meanwhile Trump's tariffs & rising gas prices are being paid for by the middle class & poor.
2750 2018-08-31 21:42:57 Been so busy cooking and cleaning that I hadn’t even had time to look at stocks today.
2751 2018-08-31 21:42:20 3. As for "banning guns," you're operating from a position that's only been held for about 20 years. As a nation, we used to agree that civilians shouldn't have war weapons, and we banned machine guns. Now the climate is SO EXTREME that the GOP promotes garbage like bump stocks.

2757 2018-08-31 21:38:22 The estimated 69.6 million Americans who are expected to travel by car during the Labor Day weekend will face the highest gasoline prices since 2014 - Gas stocks must make up a large part of trump’s stock portfolio.
2758 2018-08-31 21:38:14 Fair point if corporations didn't use their tax cut money to buy back their stocks at a high price, boosting artificially the stock market
2759 2018-08-31 21:37:43 LTC at $225 in 10 yrs? Probably more like $1,500 to $3,000. This study seems very  conservative. But even still some very strong annual rates of return...better than stocks.

2763 2018-08-31 21:35:03 Forcing stocks to trade by the nickel is so backwards nuts. Big money can still trade via pennies, which means they can trade in the void.

2797 2018-08-31 21:15:44 He's right that stocks are better than bonds. Bonds are for clowns and low risk institutions only.  However, businesses dont change much day to day. But price changes day to day. So WHEN to buy is most important decision in the analysis (that IS knowable, but obv not to buffet)
2798 2018-08-31 21:15:24 There aren't so many garden birds around right now. Many are lying low while they get their new plumage and also there's lots of food available in the fields and hedgerows. Persevere and they'll turn up once the natural food stocks get low.
2799 2018-08-31 21:14:58 Well what's important to consider is the fact that it doesn't force you play all unique characters so new players can all play one character and good players can play for example two stocks with their main in one stock with their secondary. What makes it good is it flexible

1: You don’t owe nobody anything, your here for you.
2: If you have a problem or something bothering you, call it out, dwelling heals nothing.
3: Sometimes you don’t get closure, you just move on.

2812 2018-08-31 21:06:28 You are going about it all wrong. First you need to change tax policy so that corporations are taxed to pay for retraining of workers that loose their job through outsourcing or relocation to another state.  Then you need to tax Wall Street transactions based on time stocks are/1

2929 2018-08-31 19:54:50 @ZevFima seems like there’s a few stocks the club would want to add to at these levels, especially with all the cash raising recently. Are you holding off because of the long weekend and potential for negative news? Is that an appropriate strategy for weekends like this?

2934 2018-08-31 19:47:24 Heading to the close and the S&P looks stuck at 2900. What an incredible run US stocks have had since the financial crisis. It has now been just shy of 9 1/2 years since the infamous 666 level the S&P hit in March of 2009.
2935 2018-08-31 19:47:10 I thought that Amber Stocks would get at least one more year to try and bring the Sky back to the playoffs before she would be on the hot seat. I guess that seat was hot much earlier than expected @WNBAinsidr #WNBA
2936 2018-08-31 19:45:21 CNBC at the low in the stock market they said "we are going to have to learn how to short stocks to make money in this market" They told us how great housing was when Valet parking guys in Vegas had 20 homes. Who is left to buy. They lied because they were told to.

2940 2018-08-31 19:42:42 Well they've stated that Sony already made the maximum that they will be making. So right now the few times that stocks have returned are just handfuls that had been canceled or held back, so good luck on that wait

2942 2018-08-31 19:41:17 If you're talking hyperinflation, yes, stocks will go up big in nominal terms. If you're just talking higher inflation, they will do down big as the multiple contracts in response to higher nominal rates.
2943 2018-08-31 19:40:21 I don't get what you're saying when you said it's more lenient if you know it's 10% for basically all stocks.

2949 2018-08-31 19:36:18 If I can play 3 stocks on one character I'm fine with it, bit otherwise just keep it to a side event please. Only really want to specialize in one maybe two characters.
2950 2018-08-31 19:36:04 I'm worried people will sell the retail stocks when they come to work on Tuesday and it's a magical Christmas snowscape. They'll think maybe 3mo of Christmas has been priced in over the last 2 weeks...
2951 2018-08-31 19:35:34 I personally think Amber Stocks should’ve been given 1 more season. This was her 1st year with lottery pick rookies. They played pretty good and the team looked like it was coming together towards the end of the season... #wnba

2958 2018-08-31 19:31:25 I think @Amber_Stocks is a great coach, a shame she wasn't given more time with @wnbachicagosky .  I expect she'll continue to contribute and be an important influence on the game.
2959 2018-08-31 19:31:24 Hold on though, aren't circuit breakers more lenient in terms of %s with <$2 stocks? Seems like that based off of what I read on Investopedia.
2960 2018-08-31 19:31:05 I am tired of being told that MTG is expensive because of investors treating it like stocks, that argument is such a strawman-Cards are expensive because of high demand/low supply, spectators make up a much smaller portion of demand that players who want to play with the cards
2961 2018-08-31 19:31:03 Pot stocks  It’s not even LEGAL yet. Invest in pot stocks now so that when the farm bill passes in October &cannabis is rescheduled, you make a killing  They’re also SO easy to trade BC there’s no smart comps or algos in pot stocks BC institutional investors can’t invest.
2962 2018-08-31 19:30:21 Don’t invest long term in penny stocks. Too volatile get in and out quick. It’s all about the patterns

2981 2018-08-31 19:16:33 Like the buyand hold method with solid price entry and dividend reinvestment. It’s all about what you pay for a stock within its valuations. Which for high volume stocks is pretty tough right now.

2986 2018-08-31 19:15:19 I feel like she's got another dip in her first as we get into shoulder season, but with stocks low, any good demand period could really punch it up to that level down the road.

2993 2018-08-31 19:12:01 Heed Trump’s advice and buy stocks. You can think of Trump as the CEO of America right now; Americans will never get an insider trading tip quite like this.

2998 2018-08-31 19:08:47 this is why they are stuffing courts. They know they are headed for the same jails that have been funding their campaigns for years. Fact: prison stocks were way down last Sept/Oct. They surged immediately after the election. SURGED
2999 2018-08-31 19:08:21 Wouldn’t it be more interesting to look at the total value of the volume instead of the amount of stocks? Higher prices usually amount to buying fewer stocks but still amount to the same value.

3016 2018-08-31 18:58:07 I feel bad for the Chicago Sky. They not too long ago fired Pokey Chatman.  Now they’ve fired her replacement, Amber Stocks. I mean, what is it with that organization??? #WNBA
3017 2018-08-31 18:57:55 If it’s flexible like JC said it could even be the main mode. Imagine a guy who plays 1 stock of a mid tier he specializes in and 2 stocks of his top tier main fighting a low tier hero who plays 3 characters no one ever gets to usually see and kicks ass.

3057 2018-08-31 18:40:05 @elonmusk  Dear Mr. Elon Musk. I am a big fan of your thoughts. Based on your earlier tweet that Tesla will go private with buy back at $420 - I bought tesla stocks on Aug 8th at $375.70 - 10 stocks . Today the stock is $300. I lost about $760. Kindly help is possible. Thanks

Is it right to continue to anticipate strong global growth and buy stocks into this pullback? Or are we sufficiently close to the end of the cycle that they should be switching into more defensive assets and selling into any rally?

3163 2018-08-31 17:56:31 Agree! Stocks was instrumental in picking Diamond and I don't think the team was 100% healthy the entire season. And without a full roster training camp. Just the name of the game I guess.
3164 2018-08-31 17:55:28 Amber Stocks did amazing in drafted Diamond DeShields and Gabby Williams
3165 2018-08-31 17:53:30 Haha the usual advice on when to get conservative is I think more like age 50! Yeah, asset allocate for sure. But stocks have the best long term return by far. I'm liking Bitcoin and ethereum too.

3168 2018-08-31 17:52:48 Stocks' dismissal today makes you wonder what or if she knew anything and what ownership had in mind for the future of the franchise as she sat on national TV representing the organization during Tuesday's draft lottery. Very interesting timing for the move @WNBAinsidr #WNBA

3171 2018-08-31 17:51:54 In the UK a percentage of monthly wages now has to go into pension funds which are used to buy stocks. Its compulsory. Institutional stock ownership will be off-loaded in this way. Companies will create blockchain assets that they can pump from zero instead
3172 2018-08-31 17:51:48 My life is much more secure. My house is worth a lot more. My stocks have gone up. The economy is thriving once again. And I have a sense that America will once again be the greatest Nation on Earth. Just to name a few.

3186 2018-08-31 17:48:21 There is one fund management house that launched on the basis that asset allocation drives returns.  Their approach seemed poor i.e. buy Chinese equities they are cheap, European stocks are set to recover or  exit commodities.  They had little clue what they actually owned.
3187 2018-08-31 17:48:04 Avoid risk completely in the market. Doesn't mean buy overvalued stocks. Doesnt mean sell  everything. Just avoid debt ridden, cyclical companies and inflated small caps.

3196 2018-08-31 17:45:39 Is all this tussling over trade a big deal to the market, or no big deal to the market? Bottom line is that you don't know for sure, so assume nothing. Just watch the stocks!

3206 2018-08-31 17:43:49 But but but US stocks and specifically IWM must be completely insulated bc price and mkt has been right and all trends are our friends, whatever has been going up or down must continue
3207 2018-08-31 17:42:56 No, none. Only use RSI to time market bottoms in indexes. Never for individual stocks.
3208 2018-08-31 17:42:30 Strategic asset allocation is to match investment goals (i.e. reduce risk).  Tactical is to generate returns.  Terry Smith article is saying that asset allocation isn't a good driver of returns i.e. tactical.  He is saying it is best to find the best stocks on a global basis.
3209 2018-08-31 17:41:44 Fair enough if you are waiting for a confirmed reversal in BTC then that's fine. Not bullish on stocks though.
3210 2018-08-31 17:41:33 3) Thought experiment. You have an extra $1M; you want it to last for generations. What do you do with it? Buy a house? Buy stocks? keep in bonds? (which currency?) Buy gold?

3218 2018-08-31 17:37:21 The stock market is great.  The poor and middle-class are not.  Stocks   are a tool for the rich to gain wealth while paying a reduced tax  rate.

3408 2018-08-31 16:03:23 @1a Shockingly clueless segment on scallop conflict.

3422 2018-08-31 15:54:06 You just describe something that happens with tons of other assets... stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, etc. Your point is rising asset prices are unfair?  Investors who risk capital by buying early deserve no reward?  I don't get your strange logic.

3431 2018-08-31 15:50:57 Did a little restructuring on the $LULU iron condor. Closed out the 155c/157.5c and moved the topside range to 160c/165c.  Now the iron condor sits at a build of 120/122/160/165 with a credit, instead of loss. #options #trading #stocks #finance #volatility
3432 2018-08-31 15:49:33 It doesn't apply to individual investments. It applies to their risk contribution as part of all risky assets portfolio. So first we should calculate their beta against all risky assets portfolio (not against stocks only portfolio) to see what their return should be.

3449 2018-08-31 15:42:02 The ads on youtube about "I made $10k this morning trading stocks, you can too" make you wonder

1. The infomercial doesn't disclaim "I made $10k on $10 million, which is a 0.1% return"
2. The informercial doesn't disclaim "I lost $20k yesterday"

3491 2018-08-31 15:32:26 But can you do it while calling your bookie and getting insider information on stocks
3492 2018-08-31 15:32:13 Twitter accounts, like people, like stocks; follow, make them smile or purchase  them before someone else does. 
3493 2018-08-31 15:31:55 Well let’s be realistic. Only 31% of Americans participate in a 401k. Secondly, not all of them invest their money in stocks. Most don’t invest that much, and unless they’ve been saving for many years the increase in their 401k is a blip. Nice try though.
3494 2018-08-31 15:31:33 I agree lack of liquidity is any's exchange biggest nightmare. However, that doesn't mean the market is not tradable, especially with capitals less than $10M. If I had to categorize the stocks at QSE based on liquidity: 34% actively traded, 33% somewhat active and 33% inactive.
3495 2018-08-31 15:30:50 #AIM garbage. So many playing pass the parcel on shite illiquid stocks trying to make a quick buck.
3496 2018-08-31 15:29:53 Love it!!! Love to see market manipulation in crypro. That's how we make money. We don't want boring 3% per year returns on the old brigade stocks.  We want violent moves and the REKED Twitter bots in overdrive
3497 2018-08-31 15:29:46 I have it on my watch list for reversal when ready! 
3498 2018-08-31 15:28:32 I think the big current risk in the economy is the lack of risk being priced into very much of anything. Bonds, stocks, real estate, etc are all priced like there's no chance anything could go wrong. We've been through that before.
3499 2018-08-31 15:28:04 Which of you stocks the garage with Amway merchandise and which of you throws it into the sea, pretending you've sold it all, because the shared illusion of your "business on the side" is the only thread still holding this sham marriage together?

3509 2018-08-31 15:23:07 The boom isn't reflecting in wages though, and most net job growth post-recession has been in poor jobs, is it possible that this is the result of the wealthiest americans plundering more from the poorest?

3528 2018-08-31 15:11:34 Basically, CryptoBonds are similar to traditional bonds. They are less risky and more stable with moderate interest rates than stocks. Bond’s prices reflect the level of trust in the government or corporates that issue bonds. #ico #Tgt #TwoGap #eth
3529 2018-08-31 15:10:49 Also, is it possible that stocks of groundnut oil exceed demand and these are old stocks being dumped in market?  Adulteration apart I am just guessing if such mechanics are at work?

3555 2018-08-31 14:59:56 Interesting. The tear and water resistant part is a little odd, but if they have a good surface and have that air cushion, I'm down. Some of those style stocks are terrible for tricks though. How much?
3556 2018-08-31 14:58:17 OK, I've checked it out. The VXF tracks the S&P Completion index, which includes all stocks that aren't in the S&P 500 but are in the total market index - it's basically a small-cap index. Deluard's exercise that I cited is different.
3557 2018-08-31 14:58:11 How? It literally says it would replace the raising and lowering of interest rates by printing money and trading it for stocks (where is the mechanism for raising interest rates by the way)
3558 2018-08-31 14:57:55 On a day-to-day basis, the market goes up and down basically randomly. Don't read too much into it. Unless you're a day trader, what you want to do is find some stocks that are likely to go up over an extended period of time. Much higher chances of success IMHO.
3559 2018-08-31 14:57:33 Further proof that salmon farming isn't to blame for demise of wild salmon stocks. Just look at the waste in this video. Perhaps it's time for Ms. Morton to give her activism plugged head a shake and apologize to salmon farmers.

3585 2018-08-31 14:44:50 Please, people. Stop comparing stocks that are doing really well to the one you want to do really well. It's short-sighted and doesn't reflect how the market actually works. All it does is prove you will pump a stock on the short term. Know what you own; give facts; don't pump.

3678 2018-08-31 14:09:12 Yes, totally with you on cyclicals: best be out of then B4 the trouble starts. Last time we had a big awful bear, PSN could be had at a low of ubder £2. The trouble is after such torid times people are scared and incredibly cautios of buying stocks, I know I was!
3679 2018-08-31 14:08:12 That makes a lot of sense - how often do you override the Stoploss and stick with it?  I'm moving more to a Long Term Quality Stocks approach and SL make even less sense with such a style.

3730 2018-08-31 13:56:43 3 of 3: if you have very high conviction stocks remaining then maybe don’t not sell but simply ride out the slope and top up when opportunity presents. In all scenarios, when the downturn is over, that’s when shopping is at it’s best.

3732 2018-08-31 13:55:47 2 of 3: these days when I sense that there could be trouble ahead I gradually without panic, move to a high cash position ensuring any low conviction stocks are sold and taking some degree of profit on overheated stocks/peak lopping. You have to have a plan.

3811 2018-08-31 13:29:18 I personally think he uses CNBC as a platform to drive his narrative creating a self fulfilling prophecy on his current short position. I think this blow off is good for Cannabis stocks in general. I sold because I felt they were becoming a bit “bitcoinish”

3912 2018-08-31 12:50:30 All fake data by PM Modi. Look at bank stocks, look at 5 bank CEO’s charged for fraud, look at bank NPA’s (worst in the world), look at the Indian Rupee. Billionaires run every quarter from the country. This is fake data due to May 2019 election preparation.

3942 2018-08-31 12:38:26 Willingness to take small losses in some stocks and to let profits grow bigger and bigger in more promising stocks is a sign of good investment management. Taking small profits in good investments and letting losses grow in bad ones is a sign of abominable investment judgement.

3947 2018-08-31 12:36:52 Trump wants to move ahead with imposing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports next week. China threatened to retaliate with duties on $60 billion of U.S. goods. The U.S. has so far imposed levies on $50 billion in Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating in kind. Stocks fell

4022 2018-08-31 11:54:26 They’ve kept on board hydrogen technology squashed since the 1920’s to save oil stocks, granted gasoline is only 20% of oil use, but 20% is huge when added to all the gas taxes. They murdered Nicolai Tesla because he was going to give the world free electricity!  Its all a scam!

4037 2018-08-31 11:42:11 I really like your approach SW. You have obviously thought hard about how to invest successfully (rather than protecting your ego). Not surprising that we have quite a few stocks in common (GAW, IGR, XPP...). Looking forward to reading more including catching up on past blogs.

4044 2018-08-31 11:40:22 That first study he cites equates risk with volatility though, which is debatable. Also that chart only shows the returns from the most- and least-volatile 10% of stocks. Far more useful to see them all, to avoid cherrypicking.
4045 2018-08-31 11:39:59 Here's why you will own more China stocks in the near future ...
4046 2018-08-31 11:39:35 Distribuidora. Retención de stocks y suba generalizada del 5% por las dudas. El Gte de Finanzas asegura que el US$ se estabiliza entre $30 y $32 hasta fin de año.

4048 2018-08-31 11:38:38 No son economías comparables. Chávez tenía un commodity a precio record y vivió de stocks. Esto es otra cosa. El mejor ejemplo es el valor del dólar que se aprecia y los resultados en general que está teniendo

There is no coincidence that Bakkt will be operational before Dec-18. 
I personally feel this will result in a massive shift in value from fiat based assets (bonds, stocks, etc) into Digital Assets. Compounding this is people fleeing their depreciating currency into crypto
4050 2018-08-31 11:36:16 Man I'm only going to buy aggressive growing stocks I'm trying to get rich right now
4051 2018-08-31 11:35:46 There were vague plans at a local authority level but my archival searches on Greater London plans of the 1980s show that these were generic (relying on 'available food stocks' from MAFF).

4057 2018-08-31 11:29:43 Chuck, you lack any integrity. The Russia story was a complete hoax and you know it. It was only ever about removing Trump the anti globalist from office. You and countless others will be historical laughing stocks. You know you have an agenda coming down from on high. Cuck Todd.
4058 2018-08-31 11:29:14 Probably stocks, economy, rates in that order
4059 2018-08-31 11:27:45 Comparing this is ridiculous. FMG at the time was making nearly $100us per ton of iron ore at that peak. Once the boom was over driven by China middle class boom the party was over. FMG stocks follow commodity prices. BTC isn't that simple.
4060 2018-08-31 11:26:52 which is one reason I don't want government or FI in crypto just yet. I want retail investors to accumulate as much as they can now, so when the crisis does hit they have a fighting chance. Maybe I'm a simpleton. Slowly unloading stocks, ex tech & been ramping up XRP
4061 2018-08-31 11:26:07 Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple. Over the centuries, they've weaseled their way back in. Today's TV preachers don't know Jesus, but they are fully invested in stocks, bonds, and off-shore accounts.

4071 2018-08-31 11:20:37 "Imagine if you had to invest in stocks/never allowed to look at the chart history."

Not necessary to imagine--some employers switched 401k's &used "proprietary comingled funds" to replace mutual funds...no history of performance, only "intention" (large cap growth, int'l, etc.)

4077 2018-08-31 11:09:43 $SPY To me a new all time high isn't (always) the ultimate signal to buy. It's the confirmation that I made a good buy on my stocks, lower.

4102 2018-08-31 10:45:43 Thanks for listening to the @VoxPodcast  output. Yes, they might at the margin but (a) it is a slightly different model and; (b) Wonga indicates that these are lower quality stocks that should not be at a big multiple. Buyer (and borrower) beware!

4104 2018-08-31 10:45:11 Not really, this is more why the stock has gone from 20 to 2 and why it is clamped. However as you can see in the table, there aren't that many stocks to be issued to convert all the bonds for YA ~1.000.000 stocks + ~500k warrants...

4262 2018-08-31 08:16:17 Given how well all the previous boycotts have gone, I'm rushing out to buy In-N-Out stocks

4265 2018-08-31 08:14:45 I'm not sure what any of this has to do with socialism.
Chances are this guy sold all his stocks in terror after the election, now he's bitter. In fact maybe he went short, anticipating a 'communist crash' and he's burnt.
Now he's like "Please! I need a crash! A recession!"
4266 2018-08-31 08:14:31 HODLing long term is hard. Over the years, profit taking and selling covered calls in stocks has capped so many trades that could have been exponential for me.

4296 2018-08-31 07:45:34 Seems to me that one of the things making it harder for Smith to drop Jennings is Cook's poor form - as you point out, their recent records are almost identical and if we need to replace one we really need to replace both. Too hard with current stocks?

4298 2018-08-31 07:43:51 But the wage in question, in the FCs, is the starting point.  We get bi-annual raises the first 2 years/variable monthly bonuses (if the FC as a whole is more productive, our raises go up even more)/stocks, OT and a lot of options to either move up the ladder or upskill yourself.

4455 2018-08-31 05:25:28 Stocks are at ATH so sell them. BTC is reaching it’s bottom (or has already hit it) so it’s a good time to accumulate. Sure stocks may go a bit higher, and Bitcoin could go a bit lower, but you don’t need to hit the very top or bottom for profit. Buy low and sell high. Simple.

4518 2018-08-31 04:30:59 3 stocks have contributed 50% of Nifty gains over the last one year.

4522 2018-08-31 04:27:11 Mr Trump is thinking f introducing capital gain tax break by issuing regulation tht wld index gains to inflation. If Trump govt manages to push this reform, it wld b an est $100bn tax cut fr those who own assets like stocks & real estate. This measure would propel US mkt further.

4524 2018-08-31 04:25:41 @GujralAshwani @_anujsinghal Futures premium is less a function of demand-supply more a function of interest rates and dividends nifty constituents stocks pay. Given start of new series, a 60-pt prem is not very significant. Ignoring dividend, its just 6% interest rate annualized

4526 2018-08-31 04:24:13 1929 isn't relevant here, since the factors leading up to the crash aren't present now. Unemployment is down, and stocks aren't over-valued.

4540 2018-08-31 04:12:42 @zerodhaonline - Guys, there has been some serious mismatch in the OHLC candle formation on Nifty 50 spot and many other stocks. It goes to the extent where it shows Green in Zerodha Pi and Red in Trading view.

I’m a leaver by the way but if things are a good idea we should copy them.
We can’t have dwindling fish stocks again- it isn’t responsible.

4546 2018-08-31 04:06:40 The S&P 500 and NASDAQ climbed to all-time highs following Monday’s announcement.

4547 2018-08-31 04:06:11 This is actually true, which is why the minimum wage needs to be raised or employers get charged for the cost of federal benefits going to their employees.

4549 2018-08-31 04:05:10 Bernie is right.  The conditions in the warehouse in Haslet, Texas is deplorable. The insurance is ok, but the cost is still expensive. $20 per hour should be the beginning wage, Mr. Bezos, and incentives for workers to remain in the job. Stocks are ok, but workers pay for them.
4550 2018-08-31 04:04:59 Zero, because I do not want to assume the risk that comes along with owning a small business. I am willing to accept a lower mean return for reduced variance, like investing in bonds instead of stocks.

4555 2018-08-31 04:01:19 #aurobindopharma at 700 levels today shall move to 780-800 in one month with a stop loss at 630. The pharma stock is above all imp averages and just 10 % away from 52 weeks high and with pharma stocks bottoming out, the risk-reward seems great.

4561 2018-08-31 03:56:18 Equity is the best Asset to create Wealth/Retirement corpus interms of Returns & Liquidity. Invest in a basket of stocks regularly.

4608 2018-08-31 03:27:57 if you're older and you have less years and earnings to expect in the future you want to weight your portfolio more towards the bond index, real estate index, less riskier stocks. This is because you need the guaranteed income more and you can't tolerate swings in the market
4609 2018-08-31 03:25:52 I differ in my thoughts on that one. Banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines are things that I believe can pass. Banning ar-15s will never go over.

4635 2018-08-31 03:08:43 I'll keep my ears open for my stocks to fly just as soon as Q happens, or the tooth fairy leaves $100 under my pillow. Whichever comes first. lol
4636 2018-08-31 03:07:47 Pensalo eh! No es urgente obvio. Pero me parece que hay un gran malentendido con esto. No puede haber "demanda de dólares para fuga" (que no sea de stocks, que por definición no puede ser permanente) si no se están generando USD x otro lado.
4637 2018-08-31 03:07:18 I love diamonds and Amazon stocks!
4638 2018-08-31 03:06:23 Will not touch aviation stocks despite steep correction. Have never bought or even recommended any aviation stock despite strong recommendations by so called market pundits. Their theory was 'Migration' but they overlooked risks of higher fuel costs & fierce competition
4639 2018-08-31 03:05:17 To end this, Billionaires pay nearly 400% more in taxes than the average middle class tax contributing person. You make money on stocks, tax, you're life insurance payments are tax deductible, because billionaires capitalist pay so much. Buy more, the fed gives you more.
4640 2018-08-31 03:05:08 Because it has been a lie. The economy is not good for 99% of Americans. The wealthy who buy back stocks to make it look like the company is soaring is a lie to make you think we are fine. Trillions of dollars in 18 months raising the deficit beyond bad. Trump is hurting America.
4641 2018-08-31 03:04:52 Not dissimilar to momentum stocks where the first few months would be easy to start to pick up speed but to continue speed you have to grow by much more bc you have compound off that higher number?
4642 2018-08-31 03:03:01 Much easier to say that when we have stocks 2 play with isn’t it. Trying to get the 2 worlds to play nice and learn from each other. It’s all relevant and both make $$$. Building wealth applies to All investments.

4644 2018-08-31 03:02:13 So if you're not stupid you will benefit regardless because the money you lost from value in stocks isn't actually gone because you still OWN the stocks
4645 2018-08-31 03:01:55 So what’s your point? All of those stocks Have at least made it over a penny. So when is your lover sam going to retire those shares? Keep pumping this bitch in your ass and your mouth.
4646 2018-08-31 03:01:37 When you don’t make enough to make ends meet because your employer has undervalued your work so s/he can buy stocks, pay exorbitant salaries and give bonuses to upper mngmt where are they supposed to get that money for “goods and services”  your tweet makes no sense to me.
4647 2018-08-31 03:00:56 Even if the stock market crashes. That's good for you. Because the crash literally sucks the risk right out of the market by reducing the price on overvalued stocks

4652 2018-08-31 02:57:17 the secret is literally all index funds:
1. Low expense costs compared to actual ETFs and individual stocks
2. Statistically high return vs quality investors - even beat warren buffett
3. Insanely low risk due to diversification over a majority of stocks
4. Stupid easy
4653 2018-08-31 02:56:52 Highly volatile stocks so you either make big gains or end up in debt

4675 2018-08-31 02:46:00 Some people seem to have the view that people buying stocks at high valuation are being irrational. 
But if the stock has shown ability to run hot and it is reasonable to expect it to continue to do so, then buying it to make a profit seems rational, so long as risk is managed.

2.) It's more fun when you know the companies and their progress is logically tied to their price

4747 2018-08-31 02:14:30 I don't think the economy is going to stay positive.  It may for people who own stocks,  who can afford great financial advisers  (that write-off is now gone), but everyday Joe-Blow who is working for a living?  It's not looking good for the future.
4748 2018-08-31 02:13:55 So what stocks are you in that are not “trash”?

Its hard for young people. Rent, student debt, low wage growth etc.. Stocks are high but many don’t own any.

4761 2018-08-31 02:06:36 Meanwhile, the rest of us, who live in the real world, where we don’t have stocks & giant 401K accounts are  seeing stagnant wages. My net this school year is less than last year and my bills are certainly not going down. Your economic policies are for YOU and your cronies!
4762 2018-08-31 02:05:55 OTC and penny stocks are even worse.

“Oh you want buy shares in a private placement for SpaceX? Nope. Sorry you need to be accredited.”

4767 2018-08-31 02:02:23 What they lost is the premium, not the actual move of the stocks. And that is small. The guys who are really short the shares are the ARB traders, and they don't lose on the short position (offset by CB moves).

4781 2018-08-31 01:53:57 He’s doing a great job for millionaires who pay their employees crap wages so low that they collect food stamps and use Medicaid. The American workers pays for these programs while they get wealthier with their tax cuts and rising stocks.
4782 2018-08-31 01:52:49 I don’t disagree with you but I think there is still some money to be made from cannabis stocks.  CGC TLRY and CRON in particular because they are on the major US exchanges.  Just my thoughts.
4783 2018-08-31 01:51:24 Sure the business leaders and shareholder love how their coffers are growing. But the majority of Americans don’t own stocks or have adequate retirement plans and aren’t seeing those gains. In fact a couple of million federal workers got their measly raises taken away today.
4784 2018-08-31 01:50:32 Of course... we can’t give federal employees a raise because we had to give corporations a raise so they could buy back their own stocks (20 billion $ worth)!

4788 2018-08-31 01:48:44 Its simply a rewrite of NAFTA. And by the way stocks dropped, @realDonaldTrump froze fed salaries as he needed to make up for tax breaks for the rich and fails this country yet again

IMHO, best place on the web to find sophisticated discussions on investing in individual stocks. A criminally underused resource.
4817 2018-08-31 01:30:05 Don’t really call it “day trading” ‘cause I think of day traders as those who trade dozens of times a day and stay glued to their monitors and charts all day. I swing-trade stocks and options anywhere from a few hours (rarely) to a few days or weeks (more common).

4819 2018-08-31 01:28:44 Yes Kay is amazing in his picks. I have been following him for several years and he is consistently the best at picking stocks. His TA is the best on twitter and he is also just a great person.
4820 2018-08-31 01:28:13 Imagine if you had to invest in stocks but you were never allowed to look at the chart history.
4821 2018-08-31 01:28:05 that is what I am saying and everyone else who was buying knows that to be true, there are a million reasons why these weed stocks are what they are. Ill give you one example. It basically cures fucking cancer and epilepsy and so many other sicknesses.
4822 2018-08-31 01:27:58 Saul's Knowledgebase is absolutely fantastic. The recent posts explaining the SaaS business model and how to value such stocks are also really good. That being said, would I model my portfolio after Saul's? No way. But it's a great place to learn.
4823 2018-08-31 01:27:31 It’s much worse than that. This is *just* in retirement, money market deposit, checking and savings and certificate of deposit accounts, according to the article.

4866 2018-08-31 00:55:40 Probably would have a greater effect on real estate than stocks. Point being, the “white collar” workers are already avoiding the taxes. It would free that money up and get used in the economy

4872 2018-08-31 00:50:13 When you invest, fund has to buy underlying stocks & pay cost (STT+Brokerage). In case of ETF that cost is recovered from an investor. For Index Fund that is added to acquisition cost. (1)

4874 2018-08-31 00:47:07 Let me propose a different question: what percentage of traders have a 1% profit every day for a whole year? I daresay with statistic confidence that it's a black swan kind of event, if you dig into the numbers, studying the distribution of stocks amongst the traders...
4875 2018-08-31 00:46:53 I'm with you, tired of him crashing the stocks, his chaos.
4876 2018-08-31 00:45:37 Btw this is not to say that stocks will fall 30%. No one knows that of course, but if you use leverage you have to consider that possibility in the risk determination.
4877 2018-08-31 00:45:27 My stocks rising, I’m going public... -@BigSean
4878 2018-08-31 00:44:11 For some reason people didnot grab the gravity of the policy change. Stock was still 195 (1.3x book given equities had grown since qtr end). $210 is 1.4x, not terrible, but not where I’d use leverage. If stocks fall 30% or economic picture worsens, BRK BV & price can easily drop.
4879 2018-08-31 00:43:36 That doesn’t mean all workers can afford to take advantage. Less than 1/2 of Americans own any stocks including in retirement plans. Stocks rose 254% under Obama yet you credit Trump for less than than during his term? Stocks dropped today over more tariffs against Chinese goods.

4884 2018-08-31 00:38:22 David, I like what your doing, but don't fall into that trap of the media isn't covering it because they don't want us to see America working.

4885 2018-08-31 00:38:08 Totally unacceptable...maybe it’s time to humiliate these criminals and bring back the stocks!
4886 2018-08-31 00:36:17 Andrew shorts stocks & then he put outs tweets accusing the company of fraud to scare investors into selling. Then all these law firms jump on to take advantage of the people that lost money due to the fall in stock price. We see your games. What is he, the stock price police?
4887 2018-08-31 00:35:44 NFA is selling its stocks to the rice retailers. Although if you go to their warehouse, a person can buy rice on a per kilo basis. If you notice, NFA is only engaging in rice distribution. Buy and sell is what they do. They buy locally or imported to stabilize the cost of rice.

 #TradersDoItSitting
4891 2018-08-31 00:32:14 Because our economy is great. Stocks have broken records never reaches before. All Democrats said Trump will never reach 2GDP he’s reached 4! Nothing you say takes away our economy under the current President Trump. Which you hate hearing
4892 2018-08-31 00:31:35 Let this sink in. Same DAY Trump said he would cancel pay increases for 1000s of civil & military workers he said he is might give "an estimated $100 billion tax cut that would benefit largely those who own assets such as stocks & real estate" by tying cap gains rate to inflation
4893 2018-08-31 00:29:53 News released doesn’t always move the needle. Some OTC stocks release something almost daily and can remain flat...which is annoying.
4894 2018-08-31 00:29:33 If the Ottawa wealth effect around pot stocks is any indicator... probably quite a few.
4895 2018-08-31 00:26:17 Any day EA loses money is a good day in my book. Nice to see the stocks dropping because of Battlefield.
4896 2018-08-31 00:24:23 All good. thx for the reply. What particular type of stocks do you follow?
4897 2018-08-31 00:24:09 That's because stocks always go up no matter what - Federal Reserve

4899 2018-08-31 00:20:29 into the supply, the rarer it becomes until the supply runs out. Take Bitcoin for example, it keeps increasing in value as people mine more and more Bitcoin. Imagine how much it will be worth when it hits its limited supply. Cryptos is different from cash and stocks.
4900 2018-08-31 00:20:22 I'm continually in the process of narrowing my focus to what I consider to be select stocks. Simply put, ones with better than average probability of success, with significant upside potential and reasonable downside risk. Process is based on real evidence as it presents itself.

4902 2018-08-31 00:20:00 Diana is given a blood transfusion from the hospital’s stocks of O Regis negative blood while attempts are made to resuscitate her and restart her heart.

It is not looking good.
4903 2018-08-31 00:19:27 They’re basically waiting to die and sitting on properties n stocks instead of cashing em in and using the money to avoid tax hits. Same reason Warren Buffett will never sell his Coca-Cola stocks
4904 2018-08-31 00:19:05 You would be correct if we were talking about cash or stocks because they have an infinite supply so anytime you create more cash or stocks, it's dilutes the supply and value. But we are talking about crypto which only has a limited amount so the more tokens that are introduced
4905 2018-08-31 00:17:56 Older couples selling their homes long after children have left using money for retirement. Near elimination of 1031 exchanges and wasteful legal fees that come w it. Folks holding onto stocks w huge gains
4906 2018-08-31 00:16:27 This and all DJIA long term historical charts are silly most of the stocks or cos in the index in 1929 don't exist anymore. Some die some get eaten or eat others new ones puff inserted.
4907 2018-08-31 00:16:19 Full time workers at BNA3 are paid 12.75.  While part time get paid more. Employees that work there that are on government assistance and their mental health suffers. Bonuses are gone if you miss 1 hour two times per quarter. You can't get stocks for 2 years.  Tell the truth AMZ!

4911 2018-08-31 00:10:41 Chicago has very strict gun laws but it’s like the Wild West every week. No bump stocks used there. Out of 71 shootings a few weeks ago only one arrest. So what good would that do? Just asking
4912 2018-08-31 00:10:10 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4913 2018-08-31 00:09:28 The money proceeds from the sale of the stocks. NFA's mandate is to buy from farmers & distribute it at local market. If there's nothing to buy, they have to import so that the cost of the rice in the market is stable. If they aren't doing their job, then they should be abolished
4914 2018-08-31 00:09:26 401k's won't benefit in the long term, when it comes back down due to irresponsible handouts to the wealthy. Only the short term stock trades, stock buybacks, buying up smaller companies, and eventual shorting stocks will come out on top of this.
4915 2018-08-31 00:07:59 unfortunatly Donny only wealthier people own stocks. This means nothing to the average working-class person

Seeking ur suggestion...
4917 2018-08-31 00:04:49 J'ai suis d'accord! There are strict rules on size and amount of shellfish allowed to be taken, and French adhere to the rules!
If marauders are allowed to destroy the stocks, there will be no scallops.
4918 2018-08-31 00:03:30 BTW, in 2013 LegiStorm reported that O'Rourke may have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, O'Rourke had purchased seven stocks, including stock in Twitter, at IPO prices, seeing a 39 percent increase on shares! Ethics Violation!! Look up the story!!
4919 2018-08-31 00:03:01 Its not just the 4.5 billion of our money they pissed away buying a  60 year old pipeline that they have no intention of twinning. Canadian oil stocks dropped over 7% on todays news as well for countless billions more. This is all on Trudeaus head.
4920 2018-08-31 00:01:09 Stocks still nice
4921 2018-08-31 00:00:59 ...other examples of this type of instl quality: $PYPL $TWTR $BABA The challenge is holding through normal corrections, which requires trimming, but not folding, the position. Having a profit cushion going into a correction makes it easier #stocks
4922 2018-08-31 00:00:43 Personal bias it seems. Stocks dont slide 10% because everything is great.
