"Livestock" (living commodities) should not exist.  Commodifying animals is wrong. Shelters aren't solutions to puppy mills either.

41 2018-02-26 20:56:15 You probably know the answer. But before I provide the facts. I think the premise of your question pitting commodities against each other is flawed. Should we only have wheat based products on our plate in Australia?  How much water for milk, nuts, fruit, wine, veggies etc

65 2018-02-26 19:28:30 Buy 7 or 8 commodities that are trading below the galactic average 5 tons at a time and test sell them in systems where you think they may be in demand.  

That little test investment pays off if you keep notes.
66 2018-02-26 19:25:40 Look at what has a high demand number/graph in every system you visit. Compare the buy price with how far it is above the Galactic average to see what commodities are "hot".

Then visit the systems that produce those items, compare the sell price to see if there is overstock.

82 2018-02-26 18:14:45 and the £ against the $ is now back to pre vote levels & most commodities are priced in dollars which is why inflation is falling back & prices are stable

84 2018-02-26 18:08:25 No, I just don't agree with the way you frame this. There is art that is state funded and there is art that is bought privately. The two hardly cross over. Commodities are not controlled by the state, and the art market has very little to do with the state.

I've been saying this since the Clintons came on the scene in the 90's when Soros became a trillionaire on commodities & funds (Quantum esp). I tried 2 warn EVERYONE of this in 2008, but they "wanted to make history" & there lies the problem!
88 2018-02-26 17:56:37 Those lumber prices were cratering 2 years ago and the home prices kept ramping up (I had often tweeted the price of plywood and copper wire crashing).

I'm sympathetic to the commodity cost issue... but that showed me that this wasn't about commodities.

112 2018-02-26 16:42:22 As much as we love food, we also understand there are some inherent challenges. Although food production is a critical livelihood for local farmers, we also know that food, among other commodities, is responsible for deforestation! We work with brands to counter this!

134 2018-02-26 15:10:22 Given that about half the reported deficit is the result of tax avoidance and the other half is the result of offshore borrowing, putting tariffs on low margin commodities like steel and aluminum may just move the trade deficit to higher value added products.

231 2018-02-26 05:58:37 The best investment is commodities as we are about to enter into a new super cycle. We are either going to get the inflation the sages have been calling for, or we will continue to see global growth in deflationary backdrop. Either outcome is bullish for commodities. Asymmetric

249 2018-02-26 03:40:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
250 2018-02-26 03:25:49 We must have Universal #Broadband, Streamline SNAP funding, Omnibus Comprehensive Reforming of Our Commodities, Nutritional and Supplemental Insurance. We must have federal Initiative that would help States and local governments partner with small family farmers!

251 2018-02-26 03:23:53 the lack of intrinsic value is apparent in all currencies, stocks, bonds, assets, and commodities. The value of any asset solely depends on its supply and demand, and the market is responsible for its value - the market decides.

262 2018-02-26 02:20:16 Very wise Lesley, people forget how manipulated BTC is by traders, miners, banks and politicians. LTC and ETH are alot less painful to hold. Like commodities in real life both of them just need time.

264 2018-02-26 01:49:54 Yep! Dehumanization of celebs is a big factor too :/ I wonder if it’s also because of how celeb culture is packaged as commodities to us. I see this behavior more blatantly in kpop tbh but I think the US does it, just that it’s more hidden.
265 2018-02-26 01:45:30 But this isn’t about liquid milk - it’s about traded dairy commodities (milk powder, butter and cheese) which move the price of milk.
266 2018-02-26 01:40:55 America needs a children's rights platform - period.   Link all of these ills in our society and gun violence to our disinterest in the preservation of youth.  These detractors are saying that children are throw-away commodities. Press that point.  Its not the Medieval Age.

278 2018-02-26 00:38:56 Does nat gas trade in tandem with gold, oil and other commodities when there is possible deflation pressure as you show (ie down) or does it march to its own drumbeat at times independent of other commodities?
279 2018-02-26 00:34:28 Because even if they do get rid of that rule, they will just try and pay the next tier of talent that will HAVE to go to college. Those players will become the commodities after a select few will succeed at making the jump.
280 2018-02-26 00:16:27 True but in my opinion I still think we can relate with these states coming to the negotiating table with the goal of securing favourable trade conditions between our countries. This could be in terms of us exporting commodities for technical know how
281 2018-02-26 00:13:25 Haha of course he does; I'm being a smart ass. The idea referenced—that what ppl want from entertainment commodities *is* their subjection—is ofc not restricted to Adorno's writings on jazz; it's his thesis wrt the whole culture industry.
282 2018-02-26 00:06:01 IMO, a coming strong $ will contribute to continued asset price inflation in US based on capital flows (deflation elsewhere).  I think commodities may rise but not brk out until we get past apex of $ rise.  $ & Gold can rise together due to global problems that a strong $ causes.
