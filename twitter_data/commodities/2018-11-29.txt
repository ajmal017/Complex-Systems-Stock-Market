42 2018-11-29 22:25:47 Understd.  If they're running a $700B goods surplus ex-commodities, gain the ability to print CNY for commodities by offering net gold settlement & opening up bond mkt a bit, this prevents exposing themselves to western game of flood capital in & flood capital out to destroy them

47 2018-11-29 21:58:07 Can @CNRailway & CPR ship a additional 450000 bpd without hurting other commodities or is @RachelNotley making the wrong call instead curtailing production of those without integrated processing. Could it work or should they just ride it out. #abpoli #cndpoli

49 2018-11-29 21:53:53 Because whether or not tax payer money goes to their other options & not abortion is irrelevant. If we put up sanctions on trade (the trade of goods/commodities doesn't directly fund injustice) against countries because they commit human rights violations, then the same for PP.
50 2018-11-29 21:31:45 Yes trading commodities is super shady business.  You should try it, beats the hell out of being a wage slave.
51 2018-11-29 21:25:45 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
52 2018-11-29 21:24:19 El valor del #Petro sigue teniendo inconsistencias:
El precio del @PetroDivisa sube a pesar de que el valor de los commodities que lo respaldan (petróleo y oro) han caído
Mientras la @sunacrip reporta que se vende en Bs.S. 5.100, el BCV dice que cuesta Bs.S. 3.600
53 2018-11-29 21:18:14 4.22%... S&P 500, Nasdaq: 2%... economic news: 2nd rev., 3rd quarter GDP, expected,  unchanged: 3.5%, 2nd quarter, growth of 4.2%... commodities: global oil prices, suff. West Texas Intermediate: $50 per barrel... crude lost 23%...
54 2018-11-29 21:13:56 I'm not convinced that commodities are easy to class in "national interest". Defense & aerospace is a better fit, especially when they also do rail & transportation systems....
Actually, on that topic, remember the F18 swap to 'peg?  That was aeons ago, but...

55 2018-11-29 21:08:45 All commodities are a sell these are not real businesses
56 2018-11-29 21:06:51 Why in a time of low CPI and low interest rates how they demand more pay. Maybe this is a reflection of the struggle majority of genuine workers have in maintaining a moderate living style when prices for services, commodities, food, fuel, energy, housing have eroded cash flow
57 2018-11-29 21:03:41 Sentiment? Oil down, inflation slowing, earnings slowing, GDP slowing. Markets down from all-time highs. Commodities wrecked. I could go on. But a couple of tweets about a "great meeting with the wonderful Mr. Commie leader" will fix it.

59 2018-11-29 20:50:37 We're pretty sure this wasn't reported...can't imagine why. And if anyone is aware of an Insurance company that does offer coverage for commodities such as this, please let us know. On the quiet like.
60 2018-11-29 20:49:37 They say they're in charge of the economy,when masses are suffering what type of tax is that taxable on commodities and not (y)based what kind of theory are you applying for wat out come??
61 2018-11-29 20:48:30 Like cattle, cord wood or grist for the mill. Commodities. Receptacles. Not human beings. Rich men in the thick of the system "feeding". That's what's important to power, keeping uppity wave makers in their place. Do not disturb the status quo.
62 2018-11-29 20:43:55 E aí perde-se bilhões de dólares em aquisições de commodities brasileiras, além de milhares de empregos diretos e indiretos.
63 2018-11-29 20:42:54 I don't know, maybe some are and some aren't. What does this have to do with taking away anything? Communism is an economic system in which there is no class ownership of capital and people exchange labour instead of commodities. It has nothing to do with redistribution
64 2018-11-29 20:37:16 Time and change are the raw materials of life. These are the two things you can’t stop and they keep moving, they keep happening and they build your life. Time and change are building blocks, in other words they are the only commodities in life that every human has in common.

66 2018-11-29 20:31:03 Suggest, you get your story or communication right. It looks plain stupid. And stop pointing at capped discounts on certain products. Neither parties are new to buying / selling commodities online.

68 2018-11-29 20:26:57 Modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities. When shoppers purchase tangible products (other than groceries), they want those items to either tell a story, fit into their lifestyle, be completely unique, or all of the above.
69 2018-11-29 20:14:27 DESTAQUE DA SEMANA - COMMODITIES: As exportações de soja do Brasil no acumulado do ano até agora somaram 78,5 milhões de toneladas, aumento de mais de 10 milhões de toneladas na comparação com o volume exportado em todo o ano de 2017, segundo dados do governo.

75 2018-11-29 19:53:45 The act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Companies like @Amazon & subscription businesses will make this easier through offerings like auto-renewals, one-tap purchases, & same-day delivery, so the routine component of shopping will become more streamlined.

Crypto = commodities and if they aren’t they are securities and then they are basically illegal to trade in the current legal framework.

95 2018-11-29 18:36:50 Both just prove, as in Terez Paylor’s article, that fans will forgive anything if the dude is good...will even cheer him and defend him, all because he helps their team. Sad and disgusting, but fact. And teams themselves, view players as commodities, not people.

98 2018-11-29 18:31:06 USD's reserve status can't be changed quickly until foreign arbitrage in commodities, land and financial markets is allowed. This requires an open capital account to reprice CNY and interest rates. That's what they're scared of. It's their move first, not the world.

106 2018-11-29 18:08:44 Mm, it is always worth the time of stopping to look at the specific language being used.  This certainly does suggest a worldview of materialism, commodities, the price of everything and the value of nothing.

112 2018-11-29 17:49:32 Matt, that is spot on! Why are we giving away to Nestle the most valuable of commodities that we have-water? Because GOP leaders get boatloads of $ from Nestle and don't care about the people of MI or America

123 2018-11-29 17:15:50 #MSW You are talking to a great man there, MAMADOU GAYE is a living legend, since I knew him I always feel goosebumps whenever he talks football in Africa, one of the rare commodities we have in Africa who is not scared of anybody... I love his journalistic style @robertmarawa

125 2018-11-29 17:03:18 Have you back tested astro for crypto? If is, how far back does it correlate? What aspects are you focusing on. In the 90's Goldman used eclipses as indicators and in the 1800's-early 1900's it was used for commodities trading.
126 2018-11-29 16:56:31 Dollar week, should help indices and commodities
127 2018-11-29 16:55:54 Regardless what Chinese „statistics“ say (have details on how some of these are compiled, hair-raisingly large tolerances owing to assumptions) , if prices rise or drop in China then this is due to domestic supply/demand balance unhinged. Valid for all commodities.
128 2018-11-29 16:54:31 Sir.. The bottleneck lies in the logistical challenges... especially for perishable commodities like apples. The initiative of dry port could have been a game changer... 
Hope someone takes it up again!
129 2018-11-29 16:53:47 symbols of social justice are commodities, maybe it's best to uplift ideology for the people instead of placeholding critical thinking with slogans and icons

135 2018-11-29 16:32:51  excellent article. Apple should buy Tesla. Google's AI based call screening, photos will be super good. Phones may become commodities (like PC became) & services maybe be the advantage.
136 2018-11-29 16:30:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.

138 2018-11-29 16:22:20 @EIU_Commodities the commodities market should be closed at 5 pm global markets maximum effects indian market and investors loss money

140 2018-11-29 16:03:52 i think that might be backwards, since commodities are actually worth something and have intrinsic value.
141 2018-11-29 16:03:09 I'm sure we could debate this till the cows come home. But quote from wikipedia: ripple supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.Ripple uses gateways  similar to banks ...
142 2018-11-29 16:01:59 tbh i really wish we paid more attention to how much the framework of commodities and consumption informs our engagement with hobbies, passions, or things that we love- that presumably could be bought and sold by others
143 2018-11-29 15:59:13 Menor Inflación anticipa menos subidas de la TPM por parte de la Reserva Federal USA.

145 2018-11-29 15:56:18 i love to make herbal medicine, do yoga, cook, etc. but the highest  expression of my love isn't actually turning those things into consumptable commodities

148 2018-11-29 15:49:18 Caitlin, hopefully Jake will correct me, but spot crypto exchanges are  handling  either commodities (e.g. bitcoin), in which case they don't need permission from SEC/CFTC, or securities in which case getting an ATS license would allow them to operate without any trouble from SEC
149 2018-11-29 15:47:48 Free markets of commodities cannot exist until free markets of CURRENCIES exist! End of story!
150 2018-11-29 15:45:58 FilmStruck died because I didn’t mention it enough in Jeremy Morris’s Digital Commodities seminar.
151 2018-11-29 15:38:34 Those who market (not produce) commodities create consumers first. Those who create jobs create minds for the jobs first.
152 2018-11-29 15:35:22 Imagine if Obama, or any Democratic POTUS destroyed relationship with one of the largest buyers (China) of U.S. farm commodities. The reaction on th right wld b days of rage, farmers would be blocking freeways with their tractors. .. 1/
153 2018-11-29 15:31:59 @The_Real_JSP I'm just catching up with @loosewomen and wanted to say re the vegan discussion my husband grew up on a farm surrounded by farmers so knows exactly what goes on. He went vegetarian then vegan as the bottom line is farm animals are just commodities and pound signs 
154 2018-11-29 15:27:18 Therefore, different commodities are traded and circulated in a diversified way, so that everyone can acquire the consumption ability and use it. So in the process of this transaction, we all need to strive to maintain a balance between "get" and "use".

157 2018-11-29 15:22:36 GM cited three factors that are devastating US auto makers:

1. Rising commodities prices (Trump tariffs)
2. Rising interest rates (Trump hand-picked Fed chairman)
3. Difficult trade environment (Trump trade wars)

Do you recognize the common denominator in these three factors?
158 2018-11-29 15:11:22 yeah ive been at offices like that. My work currently is all laptops. monitors do get shut off, and laptops closed & taken home. Lights all off :).

I do wonder how much energy the stock market takes compared to crypto. given they’re both commodities of traded value.

160 2018-11-29 15:05:15 Most of the "next day" or "swing target" trading "formulas" used by current and former floor traders in active commodities work best when the "close" or "settle" is factored in #OOTT #natgas

162 2018-11-29 15:01:16 US' monetary sovereignty is changing on relative basis; past 70 yrs only US could print USDs for imported commodities.  That is changing, which changes calculus you describe in meaningful ways over time.  This is prob partly why CB's have bought gold & sold USTs on net since 2013
163 2018-11-29 14:54:45 it's the ciiiiiiiircle of commodities / and it moves us aaaaaall
164 2018-11-29 14:53:55 I think this would be kowtowing to a bunch of cowardly bullies, reinforcing their beliefs that certain human beings should be viewed as mere commodities.  Does not actually solve underlying issues and lift humanity up.

167 2018-11-29 14:48:52 for a number of commodities like wheat, milk, etc, if the price threatens to go below a certain threshold the government buys up surplus supply at that threshold price to ensure that our domestic wheat industry doesn't go belly up

169 2018-11-29 14:44:11 Well, let us see we are ten minutes into the day and if I was a young gun of say 1985, I would reach for a Cohiba and thank the markets for the day. 

I'll keep the humidor closed for a bit as this has not even remotely started with commodities.
170 2018-11-29 14:39:03 Not really. Reagan's best line was that he wouldn't make his opponents youth and inexperience an issue.  With age comes experience, wisdom and courtesy.  Housing & autos are DIW; oil & many commodities down:  this pause made sense.  The Fed was trying to push as much as it could.
171 2018-11-29 14:38:51 Bitcoin and Ethereum will probably always be lousy currencies. They can be valuable liquid commodities that power systems that host fiat-backed value transfers however. And I think that’s the way things are going.
172 2018-11-29 14:34:41 Tem q ser muito ordinário p/ ver Lula entregar refinaria nossa pra Bolívia, passar anos sustentando o ForoSP com dinheiro do BNDES, vendendo nossas commodities a preço d banana pra chineses e chamar um cara q quer negociações bilaterais com os americanos de entreguista!

174 2018-11-29 14:31:51 Why does the cost of fuel delay the flight? I can see how availability of fuel might, but not cost. Unless they are waiting for the international market in commodities to decide that there’s a glut of supply. Very odd

230 2018-11-29 11:32:54 Fair & remunerative prices for all agri commodities. This is your promise too, after all, @NarendraModi. #WadaNibhao #KisanMuktiMarch
231 2018-11-29 11:32:09 We have a duty of opening up & accelerating exploration for the development of the #OilAndGas sector. The sector can only grow when there is exploration & we find commodities. #InvestSA
232 2018-11-29 11:29:29 WTI Oil Falls Below $50 
In commodities, oil prices sank to their lowest levels in more than a year, with the U.S. benchmark dropping below $50, as swelling domestic inventories and record production scared off investors.
233 2018-11-29 11:29:19 #AdulterationIsHaraam 
They mix inferior and dangerous things in the daily eatables. Even the medicine and drugs are adulterated.
We can not even think of having the commodities like petrol, ghee, oil, salt and milk, 
free from impurities.
234 2018-11-29 11:28:13 Well of course not, we don't use them currently (and never have). It WILL impede trade because around 85% of our traded commodities will be unscheduled and unable to be traded.
235 2018-11-29 11:27:11 Sold tech. Bought TLT, utilities, consumer staples, healthcare. Lightened up oil and commodities. China is a huge risk IMHO... all my Chinese friends and contacts are fearful right now.
236 2018-11-29 11:21:23 "Farmer" means a person actively engaged in the economic and/or livelihood activity of growing crops and producing primary agricultural commodities with or without land ownership. #KisanMuktiBills seek to confer legal rights on all farmers. @PMOIndia #KisanMuktiMarch
237 2018-11-29 11:20:43 #AdulterationIsHaraam
Merchants mix inferior and dangerous things in the daily eatables. Even the medicine and drugs are adulterated. We can not even think of having the commodities like petrol, ghee, oil, salt and milk, free from impurities.
238 2018-11-29 11:20:23 Far too much of a push on commodities as an industry from farm level all the way through to coop.
239 2018-11-29 11:15:53 I think this way we will not run short of basic commodities and no need for the Government to squeeze the USD out of our pockets: We will freely give 
- Demand for goods will go down 
- Inflation will go down
240 2018-11-29 11:14:52 "Agricultural commodity" means all livestock& animal products like meat, eggs & poultry, honey, silkworm cocoons. Farmers are demanding Guaranteed, Remunerative Minimum Support Prices for all these commodities. #KisanMuktiBills #KisanMuktiMarch
241 2018-11-29 11:12:38 "Agriculture" includes cultivation of seasonal and annual crops, horticulture,farming & growing of medicinal plants, crops and intercrops as well as production of commodities like milk, meat etc. in @aikscc1’s #KisanMuktiBills  #KisanMuktiMarch
242 2018-11-29 11:08:57 Until we start selling more niche products than commodities then it will rise

246 2018-11-29 11:00:32 É pq a Conab não faz levantamentos de safra dos hortifrutis... Os estudos de safra são para os grãos e commodities. Dos hortifrutis recolhemos apenas os preços de comercializacao nas Ceasas, que deve ter sido o q vc já achou.
247 2018-11-29 10:53:35 I would rephrase it: When the global monetary system is stable and not inflationary expanding the price of oil/commodities/etc is rather stable and long term investment is flourishing enabling exploration, investment not just pump-deliver just-in-time mode. ... or...

Would this be a bottom for Commodities and Resource plays or just $RIO based on the Gann Cycle?
254 2018-11-29 10:35:23 ONU só apoia terroristas. A Venezuela está precisando de vocês. Brasil só exporta commodities. O problema para o mundo é justamente se o Brasil parasse de exportar.

258 2018-11-29 10:11:26 Government critics in the Philippines wished that inflation will reach its highest liken to what happened to Venezuela but God did not permit it to happen in a religious nation under PRRD. Thanks, the Filipinos were relieved from a soaring prices of basic commodities now.

So how is the US$ under pillows going to get to the RBZ
Because people will never spend much forex on basic commodities or even bank it on 1:1 joke.

262 2018-11-29 09:53:35 Baloch activists are in India. Free. Every terror act is comparable. You can't conveniently cherry pick what you want and bring it up and conveniently ignore the other.. Bias BJP hindutva.. Akhand bharat all that are commodities you can sell but not at the cost of blood.
263 2018-11-29 09:52:36 Not  surprising that the fashion industry given it’s long history of presenting womanhood as extreme performance and it’s fetishising of femininity to the edge of porn is thrilled to promote this ‘ideal’ of female-a delicious sum of all the commodities the fashion industry sells
264 2018-11-29 09:50:09 Media ,banks and Hollywood are the means used but they control the big industries like war machines of all sorts, oil 8ndustry .. commodities like wheat diamonds ... etc
265 2018-11-29 09:45:31 Please share the list of commodities for which BIS certification is compulsory
266 2018-11-29 09:41:54 Negotiating like that is also called bargaining. What else do people bargain over? Goods and services i.e. commodities. So yeah it's buying
267 2018-11-29 09:33:06 Dude if people owned the elephants we could get a billion on them too. No shortage of cows, dogs, cats, chickens, goats,  salmon, goldfish, or even now buffalo. Commodities get protection
268 2018-11-29 09:23:53 Nada disso. A Austrália e a NZelandia também o são. Alias, suas matrizes de exportação são quase 100% de commodities. E são países ricos. 
A questão é ser bom nisso. E deixar a população livre para empreender.

272 2018-11-29 08:52:42 Says to the world that we are a colonial outpost settled before the industrial revolution (ie steam or internal combustion) and relying on commodities to survive. Accurate other than our more recent mendicant status, but not very aspirational.
273 2018-11-29 08:42:50 Japan's attitude to all kinds of foreign workers is that we're disposable commodities. Not just details that need hashing out, a whole cultural shift is needed first.
274 2018-11-29 08:40:34 "Artificial scarcity" sums it up very well. If our bureaucracy and their many rules aren't put under some restraint, one day even water and air might become scarce commodities!
275 2018-11-29 08:40:33 nxaa surplus my foot, how can you say surplus whilst we are suffering like that, no fuel, no basic commodities, no medicine in hospitals. u are a big joke.
276 2018-11-29 08:37:42 i guess Chinese stocks meltdown continues, so more sanctions ahead, as FX is overoptimistic and US Equities are by a large above their credit fair value. no run up in commodities = low real expecations and probably nothing to come..
277 2018-11-29 08:33:51 Get well soon mdhara. Tiri kuzipigwa kuno. Fuel and basic commodities shortages. Huyai tizipigwe Cde.
278 2018-11-29 08:17:04 I hope commodities follows...
279 2018-11-29 08:14:13 Well, now I've spent half an hour looking for stuff a consumer could not-buy from MS, and it's just depressing as fuck. It's all low-value agricultural commodities, and two car factories. These people don't need a boycott, they need... I dunno. Help, of some kind.
280 2018-11-29 08:11:45 Not going to be easy but our leaders need to start making power moves to benefit more for the commodities supply chain. We're losing out big time on just about everything we export

284 2018-11-29 07:54:57 Mas é que não dá para ser competitivo quando se trata disso, não faz muita diferença para quem se vende quando estamos falando de commodities como a soja e o minério de ferro, as principais pautas de exportações para a China, isso tem preço fixo.

286 2018-11-29 07:40:53 Agreed. However, the process is such that they cannot be agreed by March 30th now. It was a Fast Track application that most now follow the full process, which can't be done in the timeframe. The uncertified schedules cover about 15% of the commodities we trade. Terrible option.
287 2018-11-29 07:32:58 EM profit growth is influenced by what? They supply materials for cellphones and commodities, but what else? I don't think you can just accept what MS says re: the chart bottoming. If you just care about the chart then maybe wait for a cup and handle before getting into EM.
288 2018-11-29 07:21:57 There is no analogy of forking to gold. Reality is not a ledger of commodities! :P
289 2018-11-29 07:16:19 there can't be peace without fuel, jobs, basic commodities shooting over the roof. No hazvigoni!!
290 2018-11-29 07:12:11 Mnangagwa downfall is not being able to all the cash crisis, no cash in banks, no fuel in garages,  shortages of basic commodities of available prices have trippled 4 e 1st time in 9yrs. That's what we call lack of strategy. Lef childish Chamisa be, EDs fall is far worse
291 2018-11-29 07:10:32 Wool.. angora... down. Fur. These animals are commodities, not living beings to the people who use them for their gain. Nearly all of the big name cosmetic brands test on animals too - saying they don't do it in the UK/EU or even US but markets like China insist on it. So they do
292 2018-11-29 06:43:35 Imagine a situation when you suffer month end with all the basics cooking oil,salt,sugar ,mealie meal,rent,soap,transport money used up!   This can also happen at a national level,fuel,prices,basics 
 and essential commodities vanish
293 2018-11-29 06:25:30 Dear Sir, with all due respect, we would request you to consider relook at the tax bracket for common man. The price has gone up for almost all commodities and there is no meaning even if we earn more, as it is nullified to that extent.
294 2018-11-29 06:00:04 It's amazing some people still support this guy while being overtaxed and paying exorbitant prices for basic commodities (when they are available), apparently we're not all in the same boat...
295 2018-11-29 05:38:43 These countries are in the business of commodities exports

306 2018-11-29 04:27:07 @eikebatista Mas os chineses também são grandes compradores de commodities minerais. É uma mentira histórica absurda a sugestão de que o Brasil acabou privilegiando suas relações com a China em detrimento das transações comerciais com os EUA.
307 2018-11-29 04:26:55 @eikebatista commodities, é o maior — por razões que lhe são próprias. O Brasil tem a sorte de ser fornecedor de parte considerável daquilo que aquele país precisa comprar. E de ter preços competitivos, o que se deve à competência, em particular, do agronegócio brasileiro.

310 2018-11-29 03:41:53 If more rate hikes expectation diminishes, the $USD will weaken more and other riskier currencies would rise against $USD,  bullush for $SPX.

312 2018-11-29 03:29:50 All of these supply chains are full of imperfect competition and effective monopsonies, as the intermediate products are bespoke, not commodities.  So the end producer will re-source the intermediate from a country not affected by the tariff, with minimal end price change.

Yet, I wouldn’t be surprised as today some people even think commodities are ‘rights’ & that making something a right generates it.
331 2018-11-29 01:21:19 Doesn't do away with the fact that commodities may be a "sunset industry" for M'sia & that those hoping for the glory days of rampant CPO, oil, LNG & rubber prices could be sorely mistaken. Buyers have wised up. Suppliers are engaged in brutal competition.
