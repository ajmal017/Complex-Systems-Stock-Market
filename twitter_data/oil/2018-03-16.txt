41 2018-03-18 23:57:41 "The other guys use boiling oil!"

You're saying we ought to be more like ISIS? Some terrorists torture, therefore so should we? By the way, when has it ever been proven that water boarding saved an American life?
42 2018-03-18 23:57:32 光のゴリラは可愛いだろ！！
43 2018-03-18 23:57:26 Ahhhh so that's what those UKGov tax breaks for oil companies are for.
- Shareholders and executives raking it in.
44 2018-03-18 23:57:23 I saw (after you got it right ) the "water" as being the oil, the serpent as either the wick or spout and the bird as the flame
45 2018-03-18 23:57:13 Things like this make me wonder ; Why do we keep invading the wrong countries. Seems off-shore bank havens would be immensely easier pickings than oil rich arab countries that are used to and prepared for 'whitey' to invade.  /js

50 2018-03-18 23:56:26 You mean protect american oil interests.  Go protest Washington state and the 5 refinery’s they have going full tilt pumping out full tankers just south of the border?

Lemon juice, fresh or Delallo  (deodorant) bentonite clay (antiperspirant).

53 2018-03-18 23:55:27 And none of these questions are getting answered - the responses I always get back are "why are you against protecting the environment!" and "you're just protecting the oil companies that pay you!" or "are you a climate change denialist?!"
54 2018-03-18 23:55:27 giving myself a hot oil treatment lord knows my follicles was screaming for it
55 2018-03-18 23:55:26 Absolutely, but what exactly IS ethical oil exploration & drilling?
56 2018-03-18 23:54:58 Excellent that the legal moves to stop this have failed 

I do wonder if they will come out looking more like snake oil salesmen as opposed to data geniuses though 

After all, they can’t be that smart to allow a fake client to snoop around for several months
57 2018-03-18 23:54:36 The USA interest is to destabilize the Middle East thus selling weapons , getting cheaper oil and bankrupting Saudi Arabia  and at that they are succeeding. So maybe they are geniuses.

66 2018-03-18 23:52:00 Nobody is talking about the positive/negatives of those countries' role. But Saudi Arabia, it's oil and alliances makes it the most influential. They've always been a loyal US ally, have influence over every Arab State as well all Sunni countries and China and India as well
67 2018-03-18 23:51:51 Hey, you know what's terrifying? When your cast iron skillet cracks all the way through. It was fine when @jcjray washed it before use. I put oil in it, and suddenly we had a major fire on our stove. We just got very lucky. @LodgeCastIron
68 2018-03-18 23:51:50 Because as a plant it could not be patented, and as a favored medicine in the US before demonization it was dampening profits of the chemical and oil based concoctions being newly promoted then. So labeled it non-native Maria and Juan.

147 2018-03-18 23:41:10 Haha there might be a good lesson to learn from using oil paints which is most def patience.
148 2018-03-18 23:41:08 Trudeau and McKenna honestly think importing oil with zero enviro regulation is better then producing it in country because of climate goals.  It’s not problem the tax payer just covers it.  They need to get launched by a catapult into the Atlantic

173 2018-03-18 23:37:35 No, she doesn't make a very good model. Although she did learn a lesson abt painting - we don't jump up on the artist's lap when working. She had a blue streak, thank goodness I use acrylic & not oil.
174 2018-03-18 23:37:34 Yamapi said he likes sushi but grilled fish as well. He doesn't like boiled fish very much. He heard somewhere that in human body fish oil melts away and human body doesn't use it much, so fish is good for dieting, also it's good for brain #sound_tripper

190 2018-03-18 23:35:13 Busy day; 3hr lift, rotated tires/changed oil/washed my soon-to-be-new vehicle. So I think some time at the bar with some friends is well earned

193 2018-03-18 23:34:47 So to be clear, you think BTC should be the only asset in existence?

No fiat is allowed? No stocks? No oil? Because those are the things that are listed on shitcoinmarketcap as part of the dominance index
194 2018-03-18 23:34:29 Stew, you left out how @SecretaryZinke was bought off long ago by coal, oil, pipeline and natural gas slimeballs (like Arch Coal, Haliburton, Peabody Energy, etc) and has supported Nazi scum like Taylor Rose. Left the Navy SEALs under black cloud for numerous "transgressions"
195 2018-03-18 23:34:12 If everybody "coperates" then we all lose. You and I both know oil lobbyists and the like will never settle for a solution that will let us meet our targets.
196 2018-03-18 23:33:55 Green plantains peel them, cut in up in like 5 put them in cold water. Dry them off then fry them@in hella@oil that overs them. Cook half way then take them out put on some wax paper or foil. Use some to mash it out. Then drop them back in the oil

199 2018-03-18 23:33:48 I be seeing some musty ass beauty blenders

All yall gotta do is soak it 6+ hours in water, blue dawn dish soap, and a tsp of olive oil & I promise it will look brand new. 

I wash mine before every application, but the deep clean helps the foundation stains come off.
200 2018-03-18 23:33:39 @Jatheish can you do a patch on oil vain (rag) 34.4 68.3 it’s glitched right out and won’t let me place my pump

202 2018-03-18 23:33:13 Almond oil smells amazing. I blend it with vitamin E oil and put it on everything with skin. Castor oil will make your lashes and brows grow too.
203 2018-03-18 23:33:05 Love doing olive oil masks on my hair
204 2018-03-18 23:32:56 いってきま
205 2018-03-18 23:32:56 I wouldn’t use it to much on my skin because it is still an “oil”. I was thinking about, more around the eyes and lip care with that. Oil with coco butter for around the eyes then oil with Shea butter for lips. The Shea will keep the lips hydrated. At least for me lol
206 2018-03-18 23:32:47 Oooh yes, with walnuts! I roast spaghetti squash cut in half drizzled with olive oil after I dig the seeds out. Note: Don't make something like chicken tetrazzini if you've roasted the squash w/olive oil because it tastes gross #fbjam

208 2018-03-18 23:32:29 You call it partner, when all it is is shipping hazardous oil through Metro Vancouver. Putting the creatures and people who depend on the sea for their livelihood at risk for oil tax revenue. There are plenty of other markets for your oil than at our environmental risk! #bcpoli
209 2018-03-18 23:32:28 Oil combustibles nos cobro impuestos como agente de retencion por cuenta y orden del estado. No les dio los fondos al estado sino que los uso para otros fines.
Lo grave es creer que es evasion, cuando es robo a los contribuyentes que engañan y fraude al estado que les encomienda.

212 2018-03-18 23:31:46 I live in the middle of a region that has produced oil since the 1950s. I do not see this environmental destruction you describe. Perhaps you imagine it, to justify campaigning against other folk's employment.
213 2018-03-18 23:31:27 There seems to be an assumption that people trying this recipe both understand how to make a roux and do not.  Also note the term “salad oil” again: oil wasn’t something one cooked with, normally, I’m guessing.
214 2018-03-18 23:31:25 It's not 700% if you include the U.S. tankers carrying crude oil from Alaska to Washington  state.

217 2018-03-18 23:30:53 @pepsi @PepsiCo @bublywater PepsiCo needs to address its massive Conflict Palm Oil problem. There’s nothing “bubly” about the pattern of exploitation by PepsiCo’s shady business partner Indofood or the fact that rainforests continue to fall for the palm oil used in their snacks
218 2018-03-18 23:30:50  Yeah I'll help you out. But I don't use coconut oil much anymore cause it dries me out if I use it too often .

222 2018-03-18 23:29:51 I live in Alaska. We call Alaska the "The Last Frontier" "The Greatland." Then it happened the Exxon Valdez not Valdeez. Spilled oil and to this day it has not been the same. We need to learn from this continuing disaster that these companies do not care about what they leave.
223 2018-03-18 23:29:50 Lucky you were born on the 20th @lindsayell the 24th in 89 is Exxon Valdez oil spill. Having that on my 10th bday wasn’t good

231 2018-03-18 23:28:49 I am currently making big pork thingies in butter, rosemary, olive oil, parsley, minced garlic, actual garlic, and finely(ish) diced onions.
I started cooking it in a pan at medium-low heat, then moved it into the oven where it's currently cruise-cooking for like an eon.
232 2018-03-18 23:28:21 Not to be dramatic but I would rather preheat my oven to 450 and then crawl inside slathered in coconut oil than play anything on Gustav Cannon

238 2018-03-18 23:27:41 I'm crying yall. My mom played tennis so when I was a kid she used to take a soup pot, fill it with hot water, epsom salt and olive oil and soak her feet in it. My dad thought it was DISGUSTING AND NOW IM DOING THE EXACT SAME THING AT 23

244 2018-03-18 23:26:06 who was the one who went to war with the middle east for oil?  Republicans. Who pulled out of the middle east because they were against the war in Iraq? Democrats. You tell me who the warmongers really are.
245 2018-03-18 23:25:58 What a biased jackass.  What did Trump do to Russia?  Kept oil prices low hurting Russia’s economy. Got NATO to strengthen forces and began putting US forces on Eastern Europe. Confronted Assad and Russia in Syria. Strengthened US forces.
246 2018-03-18 23:25:39 Do you know how much Saudi Arabia spend in your economy? If there is no Saudi money in your economy you will be nothing compared to China. Imagine if Saudi Arabia and China work together. So don't say we did not do anything for you. You protect the oil you protect your economy.
247 2018-03-18 23:25:35 They sell cuticle oil for that. Or just use hand cream & massage it into your fingers
248 2018-03-18 23:25:35 And CNNABCCBSPBRNBCFOX are real news, right? Even poor the chemtrail snake oil salesman gets it right occasionally. Let's hope this is one time he's right.
249 2018-03-18 23:25:31 Even aveeno breaks me out  but since I started layering coconut oil and lotion on my body I haven’t been getting any spots as long as my water intake and diet stays balanced. Sometimes I’ll even use Shea on my entire body but it’s so heavy so it’s rare
250 2018-03-18 23:25:25 Maybe someone should actually listen to these people and consider how bad of an idea this is. We need to move to renewables now, not blast through the landscape for more pipes to carry oil so we can totally destroy this planet.

275 2018-03-18 23:21:20 Most likely the engine is blown. But it can also be no water in the water pump, or a lack of oil changes. Take it to a shop to be sure
276 2018-03-18 23:20:55 I guess it’s nice to tell folks whatever you’re cooking with. Where I grew up, butter was the default. Or maybe lard or shortening. Oil was for frying only. It wouldn’t even occur to me to mention if I was using butter or olive oil or what have you. I’ll have to remember this.

298 2018-03-18 23:15:56 This is utter nonsense. The Energy East pipeline should be adopted so that we refine our own oil. We have the capacity to do that without building one additional refinery. Take the provincial politics out of pipelines and do the right thing for Canada. Create value added here.

Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low.
301 2018-03-18 23:15:27 If your only way of making a living, David, undermines the basic health of our planetary systems - water, air, atmosphere - then you & those telling you your 'oil or starve' economic views are legitimate suffer from a devastating lack of imagination.  #chainedtocarbon

310 2018-03-18 23:13:37 oh bud that looks like it really misses the olive oil :( how could those instructions leave this important fact out!!!
311 2018-03-18 23:13:27 Yes, especially here in Saudi Arabia we have a city called Al-Ahsa I think they have the biggest oil well in the world and they so adore with plams
312 2018-03-18 23:12:56 Sugar is nature’s battery, meaning if we could extract the energy that sugar stores, oil & gas would be obsolete!!! #GoGreen

314 2018-03-18 23:12:23 Today I had coffee with cream and coconut oil, a 350g ribeye, 7x brussels sprouts and desert spoon of crunchy peanut butter (3.4%CHO). 

(May have overdone it on the sprouts)

329 2018-03-18 23:09:49 President Hillary Clinton still has not explained why her data firm gathered information on tens of million Americans, then gave it to an oil company.

331 2018-03-18 23:09:48 Yuan is 2% of daily mkt transactions. Gold conversion is the only way to get oil producers to accept Yuan. Iran's 1M bbl/day shipped to Eurozone may be rerouted for something real in exchange.

Not the NRA, not gun manufacturers, not oil executives or pharmaceutical companies, but us. When did we resign ourselves to just letting them do this to us?

337 2018-03-18 23:08:12 dad used to like it when they had to take cod liver oil.
338 2018-03-18 23:08:05 The only thing you seem to understand is what the price of crude is today without any sort of realization as to how or why it's at that price or how industry disruptions will impact it and how that may affect the oil sands. Arrogant retard

351 2018-03-18 23:06:30 First panic attack, thank fuck for cannabis oil 
352 2018-03-18 23:05:51 Went from 7% to 3% (and even that was begrudging on the govt part, was a NATO resolution). Just not feasible with the declining economy (Arab oil embargo, worker strikes and IMF loan) and rise in domestic spending (25% - 1971).
353 2018-03-18 23:05:49 NEW coal or oil plants are never going to be built, NEW solar, wind, and  hydro plants are now cheaper to build.  No smart buisness is going to invest in a more expensive way to produce the same product, energy.

361 2018-03-18 23:04:10 Oil made those canoes. You aren’t seriously that ignorant that you’re ignoring the thousands of everyday items we rely on that are made from oil products? Obviously the irony of protestors in plastic canoes went right over your head.
362 2018-03-18 23:04:09 I can assure you that my education is many time greater than yours, if you want to compare resumes feel fee to direct message me. My point is that the oil sands will not be viable long term, I back that with facts. You on the other hand have no facts

364 2018-03-18 23:03:35 Not because Ward is anywhere near ready, but because he may not see the future he's hoping for at MSU. Been oil and water at times with Izzo's system, rotation and expectations. Depends on where Nick's mind is with all of this.
365 2018-03-18 23:03:26 Even with oil, £664bn of UK national debt, a third, is down to Barnett Formula. All those higlands just aren't economic, not now, not in 1707 when it joined England etc. Everyone forgets hundreds of years with 80%+ English sailors defending the North Sea etc. Scotland bankrupted!
366 2018-03-18 23:03:19 If you respect these workers so much, you should fight for giving these future unemployed the opportunity to train in a new energy sector with higher wages more benefits and massively less health risk.  Clean energy already employees more then coal or oil.

372 2018-03-18 23:02:59 I would say make sure yours styling on damp hair, maybe try Jane carter incredible curls or curl defining cream, or shea moisture curl and style milk. Then to keep it moisturized seal it all in with either a butter or a oil.
373 2018-03-18 23:02:53 Is there a way to regress that figure onto world crude oil prices?  I imagine the rebound is much smaller once you account for the Bush-era resource boom.

428 2018-03-18 22:57:11 ELF THOUGHT: What do you suppose @cathmckenna uses to shovel snow? Because I can't think of any kind of shovel that's not oil based plastic or coal forged steel. Oh right...the climate changed! It doesn't snow in #Canada anymore. Silly me. Carry on.
429 2018-03-18 22:57:11 Those opposing #Pipelines are confusing consumption with production. Stopping Canadian production without dealing with consumption simply increases the flow of foreign oil which hurts the environment because it's produced with lower environmental standards.

433 2018-03-18 22:56:19 Tasted a bit of the offcuts, it tastes ok but I don't taste the chocolate or the vanilla… my mum's recipe had oil in it and I thought cake had butter and milk in it. This one had neither lol
434 2018-03-18 22:56:12 To be fair to them, massaging raw kale with oil makes is much more palatable :)
435 2018-03-18 22:56:10 cilantro bunch + garlic cloves + olive oil + cumin + s&p --> blender = dinner!

438 2018-03-18 22:55:35 He is actually the most aggressive dictator. He exploits russian people for his Machiavellian ambitions on international arena while his loyal maphia and oil magnates oppress russian people.
439 2018-03-18 22:55:29 Terrible
440 2018-03-18 22:55:23 The biggest inconvenience about this weather is that my coconut oil has gone back to being solid 
441 2018-03-18 22:55:10 Most of what happens to gas prices is external to our country. You would think having one of the world's largest oil reserves would mean low prices but that's not the case. We pay one of the highest :( so much for trickle down economics.

444 2018-03-18 22:54:34 Tetmosol soap with Citronella oil. I might buy up every stock in Nigeria. Why didn't anyone think of this invention previously? It repels mosquitoes.
445 2018-03-18 22:54:26 I wonder if adding peanut butter or a little more coconut oil would help?
446 2018-03-18 22:54:15 who buys lavendar and teen oil for their household ornaments, you lubricate machines,  you pimple
447 2018-03-18 22:53:51 Find out there's no oil in the generator..
448 2018-03-18 22:53:48 One of my favorite things in oil paintings is to see a mere splotch or squiggle up close that becomes a photo-realistic glint of light on lace or a curl of hair when you back up.
449 2018-03-18 22:53:33 Letters to Juliet (2010) is NOT a good movie but damn if it doesn’t make me want to wear a sundress and inject olive oil directly into my veins
450 2018-03-18 22:53:30 Avocado oil changed my life.
451 2018-03-18 22:53:29 BEVERLY HILLS: All westbound lanes have reopened on Stoney Creek Rd after an earlier oil spill.
452 2018-03-18 22:53:24 Beautiful what oil are you using
453 2018-03-18 22:53:22 It’s so annoying that ford puts 2 different size bolts on the 1 piece of plastic I need to take off to take out my oil filter
454 2018-03-18 22:53:19 Be sure to have coconut oil nearby... just in case

462 2018-03-18 22:52:00 It should have been a backdrop of Saudi Arabia, with someone about to get his/her head chopped off, and millions of dollars raining down on her, with her thousand pound leopard print shoes in the shot. Maybe some pumping oil in there somewhere ass well.
463 2018-03-18 22:51:50 Your hair just told me to go deep condition and do a hot oil treatment

465 2018-03-18 22:51:32 Why when you have acne/scarring everyone you come across becomes a dermatologist and tells you to use bio oil  don’t you think I would have tried the all the cheaper options first before I spent a lot of money on chemical peels and acids 
466 2018-03-18 22:51:27 Spot on - now get your forces out of Syria! Stop funding terrorists for oil! Stand up to the war hawks. Are you a man or a mouse - or just a puppet?
467 2018-03-18 22:51:23 What is a reasonable timeline? The world will eventually run out of oil at some point. Why not sink our teeth into something renewable? Why wait until it runs out?

472 2018-03-18 22:50:45 American steering our protesters to challenge our businesses and courts and Chinese investors demanding more of their oil in Alberta be shipped overseas—oh, Canada, is there anything you own anymore?

477 2018-03-18 22:50:06 Where exactly does he think the oil and gas come from and arre used,
478 2018-03-18 22:50:00 If the niger delta was alone as a country,not amalgamated to the rest of Nigeria,there would have been similar developments,bcos d oil generated would be enough for d smaller population,corruption would still be very high though

485 2018-03-18 22:49:17 Lotsa headwinds for oil near term...
486 2018-03-18 22:49:14 It's a global crisis of survival, time to stop oil IMPORTATION
487 2018-03-18 22:49:12 How many goals does lucic have?
488 2018-03-18 22:48:56 A recent CD Howe study by Ben Dachis compared oil/gas costs from govts in various jurisdictions for a typical well. They were all virtually the same. Alberta not much different than Texas. So, you know, economic analysis....
489 2018-03-18 22:48:40 Ooooh he has google....I'm scared! It is a theory that has merit. Which came first, the spiders web or the oil on his legs that keeps him from getting caught in his own web? Which came first, the retina or the optic nerve?
490 2018-03-18 22:48:32 Oil Sands only accounts for 0.16 percent of global CO2 emissions. 

Go protest in China if that’s what you’re really on about. Stop getting in the way of our resource development!
491 2018-03-18 22:48:13 America will go any length to get what dey want,dey kill murmur because of oil,they framed billadin,9/11,their is this book titled "unviel how america fools the world,try and get and read it,and u shall see the whole truth on 9/11,how are in the building?
492 2018-03-18 22:48:03 Coconut oil has a salutary effect on abrasions and sometimes allergic reactions to lube, if that helps.

495 2018-03-18 22:47:52 So many people go to YouTube to learn how to do something, from changing the car’s oil to French braiding hair. Google should embrace this and create “YouTube Classroom” or YouTube University” or even “YouTube U.” Maybe bundle it with YouTube Red.
496 2018-03-18 22:47:42 That sounds yummy! My mom usually roasts hers with olive oil & balsamic vinegar #fbjam
497 2018-03-18 22:47:42 The country needs a pipeline to provide needed economic support for all Canadians. The sad part is @Greenpeace knows that as Canadians we would rather import oil from such democratic titans like Venezuela, Iraq and Saudi Arabia than provide Canadian oil to Canadians.

It doesn't STAY up there
501 2018-03-18 22:47:01 I love left over pasta heated up in a fry pan with olive oil. Better than the 1st time. Almost as good as chili.

If you’re using a lot of oil you may find that mild shampoos simply aren’t able to clean your hair, sufficiently. Build up could make water unable to penetrate your hair.
508 2018-03-18 22:46:24 Or BCers who don’t realize it’s THEIR OIL and THEIR resources. I see your point but each province is rather proprietary regarding the turf with their boundaries.
509 2018-03-18 22:46:24 What about Argan oil?
510 2018-03-18 22:46:11 Oil will go the way of candles.
511 2018-03-18 22:46:10 @realDonaldTrump No phase 2 tax cuts, you are just trying to buy more votes. Leatve our public lands, National Parks, and landmarks alone stop letting oil drilling and mining there now.

514 2018-03-18 22:45:41 Yes democracy and Zanu pf are just like oil and water.  ED is a power hungry dictator who loves to be bootlicked. He needs to be told that these people busy bootlicking him will dump him the same day Zanu is removed! These cheerleaders are unreliable!
515 2018-03-18 22:45:39 It can definitely be used as a daily facial and body cleanser, Aqua Marina is packed with mineral-rich seaweed, kaolin and calamine to calm and absorb excess oil! X Shirley & The LUSH Team
516 2018-03-18 22:45:22 You tend to lean more oily don’t you? Shape tape is good for oilier skin. But I recommend the Amazonian clay found bc it absorbs oil but leaves hydration
517 2018-03-18 22:45:12 What are you talking by about? How does EXporting dilbit to China help us in BC? Let's refine in Canada. But that's not profitable enough (notice that it would be profitable) for the Texas-owned oil giant KM.
518 2018-03-18 22:45:07 Cocoa butter + coconut oil + argan oil + blackseed oil + patchouli oil.
519 2018-03-18 22:45:00 Not necessarily much more so than having a smartphone, buying avocados or olive oil (a lot of production being controlled by drug cartels), cotton clothing (huge water/energy footprint), most illegal drugs, pet dogs (huge carbon footprint), air travel, etc.

527 2018-03-18 22:44:17 Yep. And the impending launch of this CNY/oil contract is not the *beginning* of the process; but rather the beginning of the *end* of the process.
528 2018-03-18 22:44:06 So tell me more about this, 
Is coconut oil comedogenic? I’m a cosmetologist trained in all fields, but I didn’t take skin care of the face too seriously lol.
529 2018-03-18 22:44:01 @SierraClub  Yeah, you didn't go over there to fight just to protect the profits of Big Oil.. oh, wait... hmm...
530 2018-03-18 22:43:42 OK so I put a few drops of Eden’s garden peppermint, greek lavender, And Teatree Essential oil in  my conditioner & mixed it up.  Used it today. I do this help prevent/Soothe itching – I’m sensitive to many things and even shampoo makes me itch –  1/

549 2018-03-18 22:41:16 The #EnergyDominance is bad public policy which is “Let’s use ours up first.” Oil is cheap now. Leave it in the ground - it isn’t going anywhere. Do it for economic, national security and environmental reasons.
550 2018-03-18 22:41:08 Exactly! They put sanctions against Russia (discourage EU/others to buy oil & Gas from them) but for their winters buy Russian LNG (OK by US trade law). US fool others that it would be an exporter soon when their own leaders held  pipeline connectivity across the country.

554 2018-03-18 22:40:55 If McKinnon played in Canada or the east coast of America he'd be a shoo in for MVP. Now 3rd in scoring having played 7/8 games less do to injury, best ppg avg. Without him AVs have no chance to make playoffs. I'm thinking where oil would be without Mcdavid. Prob the same place.
555 2018-03-18 22:40:44 My daughter will be taught how to change a vehicles oil and change a tire. Kids these days know absolutely nothing about cars.
556 2018-03-18 22:40:40 10 years ago they were talking about "peak oil" supply. Oh, how times have changed.
557 2018-03-18 22:40:36 The best thing to prevent "foreign meddling" is for Syria to dig up the 50 billion tons of shale oil in their country and give it to someone else. 

Plenty of leaders supported by the U.S. have done things far worse than Assad. But they grow bananas, not oil.

561 2018-03-18 22:40:09 "Get your own". When you have Crude Oil yet you don't pump it just because your salaries are too high and it's easier to buy for manipulated market price.
562 2018-03-18 22:40:04 Most of the Albertans pro oil tweets have been rude, insulting and nasty.  Haven’t noticed that quite as much in the BC anti expansion tweets.
563 2018-03-18 22:40:02 The stock market is strange because it’s seems to be based in  confidence in other peoples opinions on things. Sometimes its opions of real things like ammounts of oil drilled, but other times it’s opinions about peoples opinions. These are not distinguished.
564 2018-03-18 22:39:55 No. Just calling out the hypocrisy about complaining about alleged US money supporting protests yet not a peep about US money funding the pipeline and the oil industry.
565 2018-03-18 22:39:39 Multi-currency oil settlement will move currencies back towards pricing on Balance of Payments fundamentals, the way they traded for pretty much all of history up until 1971.  If currencies trades on BoP fundamentals, the USD is by definition the "dirtiest dirty shirt"

567 2018-03-18 22:39:26 I only wish you to let go of hate, if you dont accept my invitation to education, thats fine. And yes thanks to the oil we are not Afghanistan nor the USA we are proud citizens of Saudi.
568 2018-03-18 22:39:26 Oh it was when oil was really expensive so there bill was high anyway, then it just kept going up. 9 or ten years ago I think.

570 2018-03-18 22:39:11 As Nicola has stated, it's commonly the cheapest form of energy over the last 10 years. I believe that the future is in multiple sources of energy as oil is a declining medium (I'm a heating engineer), but for now, it's your cheapest and safest bet.

579 2018-03-18 22:37:08 Yep. That aspect is going to be brutal for them. I think the wheels will fall off for the oil companies in a compounded fashion; we move from petrol, so people buy less. Oil continues to get harder to extract. Always will. People use petrol stations less as EVs come on.

581 2018-03-18 22:37:00 Bitumen floats like other types of oil. Elizabeth May has been lying to you. 

Are you afraid of Asians who want to use oil? Or are you one of those who has enough oil and doesn't want others to have any?
582 2018-03-18 22:36:59 If that’s a crime then the whole of EU shouldn’t use any energy or oil cause lots of them come from Russia
583 2018-03-18 22:36:58 @LouiseinBC  It’s very clear that your passion for the environment is superseded only by your hate for AB. You would gladly pay whatever USA asks you to for barges of fuel. It will be American oil that will paint your coastline black - and you will still hate AB.

Placing heavy sanctions.Syria..Oh, that’s right, approving 2 yr $1.5 triion dollar build up for the military. Hey Vlad, BUDDY! Thanks for getting me elected.
587 2018-03-18 22:36:22 we are alway fighting for American oil ......we went to Vietnam for American oil .......the domino effect was just another made up bullshit theory..................
588 2018-03-18 22:36:20 The more I think about it, the more I should have tossed her a dime. And who needs a twelve pack of oil of Olay soap and two pump bottles of oil of Olay soap and oil of Olay wipes all at once? Is she having some sort of oil of Olay emergency?
589 2018-03-18 22:36:06 I'm pretty sure it's a dab rig. They're essentially a bong specific for dabs, which is essentially the THC in marijuana extracted with a solvent to form a sticky concentrated oil. 
590 2018-03-18 22:35:54 Harper had a bachelor’s degree in economics as well as his masters. He never actually worked as an Economist though. 

He did work in a mail room at an oil company though....

Then a spotlight turns on, a cone of light shining from above on a lone chair.

Hell yeah.
605 2018-03-18 22:32:11 Crude oil prices dont make gas 4.50 in Ca, and 2.50 2miles down the road in Az.  That is the Brown gas tax and price gouging.

613 2018-03-18 22:31:25 It’s not that simple though. What’s going going to power planes, ships etc. It’s not just fuel that oil is used for either.
614 2018-03-18 22:31:24 With auto repair they often have a price list with a set # of labor hours for each type of work (oil change, fuel pump, etc.) even though the amount of time the tech takes can vary greatly depending on their skill.

619 2018-03-18 22:30:42 NDP finally figured out they ran out of other people’s money, and the only way to get the gravy train running is to get our oil prices uo as the the current discount to the US leaves her no play money.

621 2018-03-18 22:30:25 I like them too, sadly I don't purchase any @CadburyUK chocolate as they use, in my opinion, poor quality ingredients.
Palm oil and glucose fructose syrup are on my avoid list. Apart from material cost, there's no reason to use them.
622 2018-03-18 22:30:15 Agreed. The most corrupt party of all: the Democrat party.
623 2018-03-18 22:29:57 NDP aren’t pro pipelines. They might get their wish of shutting down all pipelines under the guise of helping the oil industry.
624 2018-03-18 22:29:47 Because he owes them millions of dollars so they have leverage in the form of the man charged with leading the free world.  They can use that position to get what they want, better trade deals, tariffs, less sanctions, more oil money

649 2018-03-18 22:26:52 It also speaks about Neophytes in the Church: "Each newborn servant of the Crucified bears on their brow the seal of Him who died".

666 2018-03-18 22:24:59 Russia is a petro-state with an economy the size of Brazil's, dependent on exports of oil,gas, arms. Only in armaments could it be considered a world power. So Putin must militarize all tensions.

689 2018-03-18 22:21:50 is this an admission that they need us far more than we need them? 
in fact we don't need them at all, they're draining our resources & we see precious little benefit, just imagine if the income from oil was spent by Scotland instead of in London, what we could achieve with it
690 2018-03-18 22:21:37 I'm just hoping his coach next year agrees with us
691 2018-03-18 22:21:19 Spritz & Seal
Apply three oils that penetrate hair (coconut, olive, or avocado) or try them all in the shower after shampooing your hair. Make sure to ring out excess water and apply oil all over. Great for protective styles. Heavy oils and thick butters are the best sealants.
692 2018-03-18 22:21:18 A better proposal, use U.N. to a ply sanctions to all sectors of Russian interior, they have been pissing-off a lot of nations; when they scream for products; we will take their oil in trade.   Suck them dry for a while, take the burden off OPEC ?

694 2018-03-18 22:21:11 And many of those people who do not have cirizenship here DO work, DO pay taxes, and have families here. And the price of crude oil going up is hardly the fault of any individual state.
695 2018-03-18 22:21:09 The priority should be an 'Autocrats to Alternatives' plan that protects human rights, increases national security, and stabilizes the climate. The best way to get off of oil is to stop buying blood oil.

716 2018-03-18 22:18:46 Not just Putin, but the US too. The US washed their hands hoping Turkey will give Rojava an outlet for Syria’s oil. Why else was the Rojava Kurd’s response so lame? Plus, the US likely told them it had to be given to Erdogan, but definitely not back to Syria.
717 2018-03-18 22:18:34 Lettuce is really yummy friend in coconut oil and served with hoisin sauce

Just saying
718 2018-03-18 22:18:33 Well @RachelNotley won't like the US Governors opposition... so guess she'll have to cut off oil through American KM pipeline to Americans in Washington State. Im sure they'll be ok with that
719 2018-03-18 22:18:17 The one thing I would say is that all we can do is hold our own accountable. Also, I wouldn't have very much faith in the safety record of Canada's oil industry. They have a pretty strong history of regulatory capture, and not a very stellar record when it comes to the real world
720 2018-03-18 22:18:09 UAE produces 3 million, we produce 2.2 million and that's when there is peace in the Delta. One strike on an oil well or pipeline and we fall down to 1 million+. 
50+ years after we still import fuel. Doesn't it bother you that despite it's endowments Nigeria is still 3rd world?
721 2018-03-18 22:17:58 My mom’s white friend adopted a black baby girl and she keep texting my mom on what to do with her hair. She’s like “what type of oil do I put in her hair.”
722 2018-03-18 22:17:53 @tedcruz lay that pipe down in me like I was full of oil and you were a Texan
723 2018-03-18 22:17:31 At this point in Canada, who isn't broke? No one can afford an oil spill, so smarter to move to other energy sources.
724 2018-03-18 22:17:25 Hmm, what was scale of migration?

I have typically attributed modern SV to post-WWII migration of talent. And some things around that. Hadn't connected it to the gold/oil/railroad stuff--but interested to unpack this theory more.

Area I think you should really apply your theory

741 2018-03-18 22:14:54 Can you get oil,without digging for it?

748 2018-03-18 22:14:19 Costs rose January 1st, 2016 on Ontario due to cap and trade. Added 4 cents a little to gas and also added to gas and oil heating bills, so 2 years ago makes sensehttps://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3894270-

784 2018-03-18 22:10:12 Hello Sir, oil was found in commercial quantities in 1956, what was our population then? Why didn't we develop our non oil sector? Why are we still dependent on aide, borrowing and rent seeking?

795 2018-03-18 22:08:46 @JustinTrudeau please strengthen our EU trading agreements in oil & gas as our economy depends on it.  As EU are considering to add more sanctions to Russia we must have a stronger ties with our allies.  The USA can't be depended upon as a fair broker in trade so we must move on.

806 2018-03-18 22:07:19 I am waiting for an example. Berating me for not having the same expertise in your chosen field is juvenile. Critiquing a snake oil salesman is not selling an idea. It is exposing someone before they can do more harm

813 2018-03-18 22:04:48 Also, it's interesting to note that the fund was set up because of the knowledge that oil isn't sustainable and was meant to benefit future generations when the oil runs out. Recipients must have lived in AK for a full calendar year (can't just show up and get paid).

831 2018-03-18 22:02:18 Yes. Lots of confusion. Flawed permit process. Distrust of oil industry. Suspicion that US enviros fighting KM are doing so to help US trade.

854 2018-03-18 21:59:32 Listening to the @EdmontonOilers game on the radio while driving at work. Can someone PLEASE tell Jack Michaels there’s a hockey game going on? All this commentary during the play is driving me to turn it off! @630CHED I don’t want to have to buy Sirius just to listen to the Oil!
855 2018-03-18 21:59:19 If u have crappy skin like me 10/10 recommend rose hip oil for ur skin :-)
856 2018-03-18 21:59:15 Does China need gold to print Yuan for oil or any commodity? Paying in gold would be another matter no?
857 2018-03-18 21:59:10 Should other ppl in India then die eating pesticides? Lands in TN are the most fertile and our govts start extracting oil and kill farming. So much insensitivity to farming
858 2018-03-18 21:59:08 Oil & Water.  That's the old saying.
859 2018-03-18 21:59:06 まぁ夏ぐらいにはどうせ復刻してくるやろ・・・
860 2018-03-18 21:59:04 Come on, Raoul! Your apparent refusal to see the very likely connection between the soon-to-launch CNY/oil contract and the well-establised CNY/gold contract is the *KEY* to this entire issue. I know @ttmygh gets it, and that he must have discussed it with you. Think it through.
861 2018-03-18 21:58:58 What's the difference between a Texas ATM and a regular ATM? The latter dispenses money; the former...oil? steaks?
862 2018-03-18 21:58:54 Matthew Robertson's 2nd of the game and 7th of the year is the lone goal in the 2nd period. The Oil Kings lead the Hitmen 6-2 after 40. Shots 23-21 Calgary. PPs Edm 5/6, Cal 1/2 working their 3rd.
863 2018-03-18 21:58:40 Journal of James Yonge #17 But Genoa is still a good place for trade "Here is much rice, fine earthen ware, paper, velvet, satin, oil, and anchovas .."; Leaving Genoa Jan 5th they sail south along the west coast of Italy to Messina in Sicily landing "goods".
864 2018-03-18 21:58:21 My car needed an oil change like 4,000 miles ago I’m sos sorry Lucy please don’t die on me
865 2018-03-18 21:58:00 3 eggs
3 bacon strips
100g steak
2tbsp coconut oil
1/2 avocado
3/4 scoop protein
20 almonds
1 tbsp peanut butter

Breakfast.
866 2018-03-18 21:57:46 Ok zan gwada insha Allah, thank you
867 2018-03-18 21:57:23 - CAUTION -
If your car is leaking oil, make sure you fix it before you find an American tank following you.
868 2018-03-18 21:57:18 Sos need brown oil paint
869 2018-03-18 21:56:54 If reducing CO2 emissions is important, the world (not only Australia) will HAVE to go nuclear. If it is not important then we still have loads of coal, natural gas and oil. No hurry.
870 2018-03-18 21:56:52 Try doing the olive oil mayo treatment
871 2018-03-18 21:56:48 The pancake itself is buckwheat. Though any kind of pancake is delicious. Dealers choice. Butter milk, eggs, baking powder, and a dollop of cremefresh. Oil.

873 2018-03-18 21:56:48 It doesn't seem there is anything to stop the bear market ATM. Once Yuan Oil Futures start trading in the 26th March it could be a significant step towards loss of faith in the USD and movement of money into other stores of value, including crypto. That might signal the bottom.
874 2018-03-18 21:56:29 so an old bottle of flax seed oil broke open & leaked,,,, all over,,,, my entire spice cabinet....
I JUST SPENT 3 HOURS CLEANING IT UP WITH BOILING HOT WATER BC THATS ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD DO IT.
i need a nap.
875 2018-03-18 21:56:11 "Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region..The petroleum industry in Syria forms a major part of their economy."
Does this ring a bell?
876 2018-03-18 21:56:07 Why not. It's affordable to Canadians if we stop giving away our oil, lumber and electricity to the US.
877 2018-03-18 21:55:38 Coconut oil extra virgin ;).
878 2018-03-18 21:55:31 gregg night in the woods: "got oil on my face"
879 2018-03-18 21:55:24 Your oil costed...
so please protect it...
#ItwasntFree
880 2018-03-18 21:55:18 I put on too much coconut oil and now instead of feeling moisturised I feel like someone tried to make chips on my face
881 2018-03-18 21:55:17 And yet Starbucks has better pastries
882 2018-03-18 21:55:04 “I use coconut oil on my face and it works” is the equivalent to “I eat whatever I want and don’t gain weight”  well said by Jackie A.
883 2018-03-18 21:54:52 bad news is that my face wash leaked while I was travelling. good news is that everything smells like tea tree oil now so that's nice
884 2018-03-18 21:54:51 Hate when mechanics tell me I have A-Z wrong with my car.....bitch I came here for an oil change lemmelone
885 2018-03-18 21:54:48 Lmao they’re not THAT bad, I’ll just throw some castor oil n grow and they’ll be set in about a week.
886 2018-03-18 21:54:40 おはー。俺もだめだったよ。
887 2018-03-18 21:54:36 Guess I
888 2018-03-18 21:54:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love nutglob waistband are weak.
889 2018-03-18 21:54:01 What about argon oil?
890 2018-03-18 21:53:54 I just tidy it up and go home, and I won't be able to make a roux with oil instead of narcissus.
891 2018-03-18 21:53:53 それな。
早く物販の話出ないかなー
892 2018-03-18 21:53:48 Pro oil. Pro coal. Pro big biz.
893 2018-03-18 21:53:44 My Mitsubishi is expensive as hell for oil changes & gas  but it is good on gas mileage
894 2018-03-18 21:53:12 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.
895 2018-03-18 21:53:02 Nantz talmbout The Tradition. Time to change the oil on the 84 Yamaha
896 2018-03-18 21:53:00 I personally did not vote NDP but many did and now wish they hadn't. With the carbon tax and the destruction of the oil industry, many losing their jobs I can assure you the NDP will not see a second term.
897 2018-03-18 21:52:24 Yep. Please have your say. Strong support for good Council cycling plans is the oil in our gears.
898 2018-03-18 21:52:08 Or you can wash your car for free and spend $30 to change your own oil, just a thought
899 2018-03-18 21:52:05 Can you #believe this? I'm answering ads where people are looking for #workathome opportunities right?..... Well, I had like 1/2 dozen hang ups today. #unbelievable. One says she can sell ice to Eskimos, water to fish, fire to the devil. But not CBD oil, nope! never called back
900 2018-03-18 21:52:03 When you sanction a country you don’t do business with them and they lose millions of dollars a day. You don’t allow people to use their banks, buy their oil and gas, or sell them products their country needs to import. You can google it for more info but it is effective.
901 2018-03-18 21:52:02 Having its own CNY oil & gold contracts mean that PBOC has a 2nd lever to be able to avoid a CNY currency crisis.  IMF FX reserve adequacy math becomes irrelevant to China, just as irrelevant as it is for the US.  This is not well understood by investors.
902 2018-03-18 21:51:56 He"s heading for the south east Asian oil fields, If he"s looking at all ?                                         17 million reasons to kick-back !.............or invest ?

904 2018-03-18 21:51:50 Haha €591 would probably fill the tank with oil 
905 2018-03-18 21:51:44 When even your oil diffuser isn't curing the hangover, it's a real problem
906 2018-03-18 21:51:40 This oil poppin me way more than my mom ever has
907 2018-03-18 21:51:35 Tonight 7pm @ SCS Civic Arena the matchup everyone has been waiting for: D5 takes on Wolverine Oil for the chance to play for the title.

909 2018-03-18 21:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
910 2018-03-18 21:51:19 Once Yuan Oil Futures start next week and Saudi Arabia accepts Yuan as payment for Oil it's hard to understand have the USD will retain value.
911 2018-03-18 21:51:11 Allah sa albarka
912 2018-03-18 21:51:03 I saw somewhere that he uses ufo oil
913 2018-03-18 21:51:02 La Creme Rose water and violet oil paper face masks
914 2018-03-18 21:50:40 Croutons! Extra small and crispy toast pieces basically. People like to put butter, olive oil and/or herbs on them but plain is also great.
915 2018-03-18 21:50:37 The way we women are gullible sometimes, men can be so smooth with their tricks *sprays holy oil to protect me*
916 2018-03-18 21:50:36 I always put the warframe prime accessories on my steam wishlist in case some generous oil tycoon finds it and decides to gift it to me
917 2018-03-18 21:50:20 Besides Coffee, does anything smell better than onions and garlic sautéing in olive oil??
918 2018-03-18 21:50:17 When you use a slur, you should understand it. Goebbels was a propagandist for the party holding all the levers of power, much like your beloved oil and gas industry. Also, look up "irony," you may be surprised to find out how it applies here.
919 2018-03-18 21:49:57 Ironically no, because it would open the door to more questions like why we were willing to let war criminals get away with it for oil, exposing them to be war criminals themselves, and the 'terror' campaign will switch to US Foreign Policy, and everyone involved. No immunity
920 2018-03-18 21:49:51 Of course it would ruin her deal. Wouldn't have oil, whisky, water, gin, fish etc, to plunder and sell off to whoever.
921 2018-03-18 21:49:47 So that's how Ronaldo decided to cover Salah's shine
922 2018-03-18 21:49:43 Robertson walks in from the blue line and rips one past the blocker of Schneider for the Oil Kings' first even-strength goal of the game to go up 6-2.
923 2018-03-18 21:49:30 If I don’t get an oil change my shit gonna be fucked anyway 
924 2018-03-18 21:49:30 @ZipcarProv Heads up on Ford Focus Almeta: check oil and break light. That's what the car computer says
925 2018-03-18 21:49:26 6-2 Oil Kings  #CGYvsEDM
926 2018-03-18 21:49:20 Just put some olive oil on top and pretend
927 2018-03-18 21:49:20 The folks in those positions do seem to leave a lot to be desired. It’s always important to look at this from a few perspectives: BIS/IMF, Europe, Middle East. This is not only a US/China view - this is a creditor/debtor view that affects oil in general
928 2018-03-18 21:49:13 "It didn’t make any sense to me," says Wylie. "I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?"
929 2018-03-18 21:49:10 I need to go back to putting coconut oil on my hair overnight  twice a week.
930 2018-03-18 21:49:08 you didn’t even put motor oil, let alone like “oil for car” lmao vegetable oil
931 2018-03-18 21:49:07 Mix it with Palm oil.
932 2018-03-18 21:49:03 Russia, their number one source for oil, may well but I doubt Saudi(#2) will go along with anything that impedes their access to the arms they need to compete  with Iran.
933 2018-03-18 21:48:57 @SecretaryZinke Okay. Now that you have proven yourself to be an big oil twit or massive proportions, is there any way that we can kindly ask you to resign? You know, before you make an even bigger twit of yourself.
934 2018-03-18 21:48:50 When you go to Rock Oil and they don’t have wings 
935 2018-03-18 21:48:46 Just wondered who gave that bs about Brockham to the BBC and the Times ..and why..Night.
936 2018-03-18 21:48:42 Whether they will is unclear to me, but what is clear is that once CNY oil contract launches, if it is convertible (as I hear it is), China could use this to deleverage their banking system any time they saw fit/were forced to.
937 2018-03-18 21:48:36 I never realized until the Thomas Fire how many oil wells there were over by Ventura.  CRAZY.
938 2018-03-18 21:48:31 They might not know how to change their oil, but they might know the different between there and their! 
939 2018-03-18 21:48:19 I tried kava oil in some water last week and it was very relaxing.
940 2018-03-18 21:48:16 おはようございます！(｀･ω･´)ゞ

942 2018-03-18 21:47:55 I just read this tweet out of context  my how my juvenile mind laughed.  I find adding olive oil and lemon juice soon gets the right consistency, just on the right side of runny.

948 2018-03-18 21:47:03 新人に入る＝新人キラーとは限りませんよ
949 2018-03-18 21:46:59 Nope.  In commodity markets, and especially nearly perfect commodity markets like oil, "the marginal barrel prices the whole."  If you believe that markets work, you cannot also believe the world can simultaneously have 2 different gold/oil ratios (CNY & USD.)
950 2018-03-18 21:46:57 Nothing is worse than getting out of a nice hot shower and not being able to put on lotion, oil, or deodorant  #BeautyIsPain #FlawlessLaser #Sacrifice 
951 2018-03-18 21:46:54 Oil and gas are part of business. Theyre not environment like a walrus or a tree
952 2018-03-18 21:46:52 Yeah, the seed oil imparts telekinesis with prolonged consumption so they don’t really use motorized transport machinery.
953 2018-03-18 21:46:43 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
954 2018-03-18 21:46:26 Just goes to show there’s no justice in this world. Just like the snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump who is blatantly lining his pocket with taxpayers money & is openely serving Putin has still not been impeached or indicted for his many crimes. #DonTheCon #TrumpRussia
955 2018-03-18 21:46:25 Which of my neighbours is cooking beans with original local palm oil this night? My mama village people, is that you?

957 2018-03-18 21:46:17 my uncle tried teaching me how to check the oil for my car and i am just too gay for this
958 2018-03-18 21:46:15 @theresa_may We get the najority of our oil from Norway and WE DO NOT NEED FRACKING! Even tories said so last year, as do energy companies. Reinvest in renewables you backward looking fool.

961 2018-03-18 21:46:06 Run up on me we gon spray that boy head like oil sheen
962 2018-03-18 21:46:05 The incompetent local hegemons and their enablers at the center have cooked up another opportunity to fleece ND Oil Resources once again. BH worked well for them, hence this new twist. But the truth shall be told one day.
963 2018-03-18 21:46:03 the moisture surge comes in a pink container, got a sample of it once with the usual clinique stuff i buy and it was so moisturizing but not heavy at all. i heard about jojoba oil from my friend. i would try those :)
964 2018-03-18 21:45:52 Not too late tonight our Adrian, We need your batteries charged for a big week ahead. Flask and ciggies at the ready young man. Night Love Heid.
965 2018-03-18 21:45:48 There are adults that don't even know how to pump gas, so changing their own oil is 100% outta the question.
966 2018-03-18 21:45:43 People in BC complaining about gas prices make me a bit crazy. Honestly, you can’t have it both ways. You prefer oil spills in the ocean over build a safe pipeline. #WakeUp #StopComplaining @WBrettWilson
967 2018-03-18 21:45:42 Will I fuck ever use oil again on the sunbeds, my back has never been so bloody itchy in my life
968 2018-03-18 21:45:38 I think the only levels i had trouble with were the last one and oil ocean and those took me maybe 7 mins per run
969 2018-03-18 21:45:37 It's OK to cite Dubai as example of an economy sustained without oil today; but at its darkest hour in 2009 when it nearly sank on an impending default of a whopping $4.1Billion Sukuk and d world was in panic, t'was Abu Dhabi that bailed Dubai out with solid $10Billion oil money.
970 2018-03-18 21:45:37 Now I have acrylic paint , oil paint , markers and color pencils

972 2018-03-18 21:45:25 few more days, babe. add oil unto your scalp. massage it. also, do it before you sleep. it took bout a week and a few days for me to go bck to sleep properly.
973 2018-03-18 21:45:20 C-P-C has lowered gasoline and diesel prices at the pump from this morning by 0.1 N-T per liter in reflection of decline in international global crude oil prices.
974 2018-03-18 21:45:11 good to hear oil and gas aren't "the environment", everything's going to be fine I guess
975 2018-03-18 21:45:10 The renewable energy sources should have to replace the oil.
976 2018-03-18 21:44:56 For the first time over 30 years the world can dump the USD once Yuan Oil Futures start trading next week and countries like Saudi Arabia are forced to accept currencies such as the Yuan.
977 2018-03-18 21:44:54 As a result of the Oil Kings inability to gain the zone for the first 1:30 of their sixth power play, the Hitmen actually killed one off.
978 2018-03-18 21:44:48 how come my lips are always hella dry, but my face is an oil slick.

979 2018-03-18 21:44:44 At the end of the day all we really need is to find someone who you love being with as much as the US military loves invading  countries with oil
980 2018-03-18 21:44:29 I'm off to bed with a book and hot chocolate. 

Sliding right past forty and into my seventies with that bedtime routine. I just need some Oil of Ulay on my face and I'm my Nanna.
981 2018-03-18 21:44:24 I’m not sure what your point is? It seems to have become lost in your self absorption. My point is ( just a reminder), there is no viable replacement for oil at this point. Oil is necessary to drive the worlds economy. Once you have graduated kindergarten, you’ll learn that.
982 2018-03-18 21:44:11 Why are so many Republican politicians afraid of a President that is tearing the GOP apart & doing horrible things right & left. He makes up lies and sells them like an old timey snake oil salesman. He created the fictional "deep state" and now he is the biggest swamp creature.
983 2018-03-18 21:44:06 My skin has been SO CLEAR lately (aside from my rosacea) and I owe it all to the tea tree oil I use every day as a toner. And not wearing makeup this past week helped too obviously. And staying hydrated.
984 2018-03-18 21:43:55 This graph doesn't seem appropriate. Per this graph, it could simply mean those nations could simply be making more from other projects. 

Like Russia's sale of LNG to Europe. 

Shouldn't this graph be a comparison of oil costs vs. electric costs to the consumer?
985 2018-03-18 21:43:51 If you like a lot of chili oil on your pita, join our club!
986 2018-03-18 21:43:49 FYI: don’t change your oil while your car’s still hot.
987 2018-03-18 21:43:23 Putin crony meets Pruitt crony in undisclosed location out of the country. Crony offers to channel $millions into PAC supporting Pruitt’s 2024 prez election run. Pruitt in turn overrules EPA and allows Russia access to our oil reserves without a Crimea - like invasion.

989 2018-03-18 21:43:20 Fact check: North African and middle eastern people we're building some of the greatest civilisation ever know while Europeans were still living in caves. If they didn't have oil, the West wouldn't have been boning them for decades. Nice try though 
990 2018-03-18 21:43:19 Honestly check a comedogenic scale, because I’m pretty sure it’s a safe oil but I’m not 100% and don’t wanna give bad information
991 2018-03-18 21:43:19 Time to drop $$$$ on peppermint oil

995 2018-03-18 21:42:52 Man doesn’t fade. Just like Ororo - groundnut oil.
996 2018-03-18 21:42:50 Non-fungibility of CNY for oil market, true.  However, for sovereigns, CNY can be exchanged for CNY goods, or for physical gold that today trades at 1/30th the value of its 1980 value in terms of US foreign-held UST's.  This is not understood in the west, but known in the east.
997 2018-03-18 21:42:43 I’m not sure I want to know WHY there is a jar of coconut oil on the counter.... in the bathroom...
998 2018-03-18 21:42:41 I use the NYX oil control it it works amazing
999 2018-03-18 21:42:18 How can they manage nice uniforms, equipment with a bankrupt failed state and an army near mutiny?  Can't they see Crimea, with jobs,  voted 91% for Putin  while Whole Russia averaged 72%? Ukraine had an easy job: "charge a fee for letting Russian oil go to Europe"
1000 2018-03-18 21:41:57 Will the petitioners drive to Parliament or take the bus or train?

All green terrorists are personal Oil users who could not live without it 

why import oil rather than find our own?
1001 2018-03-18 21:41:53 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1002 2018-03-18 21:41:53 Oh I'm 100% sure it does. @M_Sahli_Wells is doing really great work around trying to ban oil extraction on public land in Culver City!

1006 2018-03-18 21:41:43 Well obviously krill oil doesn’t work because she looks like a wrinkly bag. Why do we need anti ageing products? Ageing is natural just embrace it. Sod the media and silly cosmetics industry. It’s all a con.
1007 2018-03-18 21:41:39 I predicted the following before like a mad man and all coming true:
1) Oil industry is going down (Electric car)
2) Diamond industry going down (Lab diamonds)
3) Cryptocurrency going down (Regulation)
4) I am starting a Commercial National Newspaper (Its happening)

1008 2018-03-18 21:41:39 In Mayo for 591,00 you could build a mansion of a house, furbish it, fill the tank with oil and probably put up a decent slatted house for the cows as well! #RoomToImprove

1010 2018-03-18 21:41:24 Back to d subject, Its in d public domain that 95% of UAE's entire oil is from Abu Dhabi, yet Abu Dhabi's economic growth is behind that of Dubai, why is it so? What is ur answer? That Dubai diversified from oil doesnt mean it didnt enjoy d advantage of oil wealth at some point.
1011 2018-03-18 21:41:17 China is using gold to gain the ability to print CNY for oil.  Also, China understands gold is the Achilles heel in the USD system, or more specifically, physical gold.  So they are constructing an elegant arbitrage to exploit the USD's Achilles heel.
1012 2018-03-18 21:41:08 coconut oil.... imma start using that
1013 2018-03-18 21:41:01 Dizziness.Fatigue.Muscle cramping.All symptoms of #ms & dehydration!

1030 2018-03-18 21:38:44 What is your govt doing about getting Alberta oil to tidal waters? It is in national interests. And when will you hold our holidaying PM accountable?
1031 2018-03-18 21:38:36 When my ex had a car i paid for the oil change and gas etc just out of the kindness of my heart and to be fair it was the only car being used it was the least i could have done... but i don’t know where the money went to pay that car note... i handed it to him and poof.. GONE
1032 2018-03-18 21:38:26 I ought to go to the gym, but I'm so tired. In burning energy like the US burns oil. My brain is trying to check out, had been since noon
1033 2018-03-18 21:38:19 The stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones we found something better. The age of oil will be ended by renewable energy and the lithium ion battery. The government is irrelevant now the tide has turned and it can't be stopped.

1040 2018-03-18 21:37:19 They are short massive amounts of USD's...and are about to launch a system that allows them to control the international trade value of the USD through oil and gold markets.  It is so elegant...
1041 2018-03-18 21:37:10 U keep forgeting 40 days ago Russia made a deal with Ypg for Conoco and then US bombed russian mercenariws killing 300 of them. Hours after that sky opened. Russia then knew US is jn control of oil gas fields not Kurds
1042 2018-03-18 21:36:37 It's like The Fly, except instead of a fly in the laboratory with Turbovicki, it was just a rental bottle of olive oil.
1043 2018-03-18 21:36:36 Oil rig workers (and wine connoisseurs). 
1044 2018-03-18 21:36:35 Interesting points for consolidating the Kurdish state but, tribalism issues aside, it's difficult for a landlocked oil exporting state to survive without at least one friendly neighbour.
1045 2018-03-18 21:36:24 I use the Balea (I think it was Balea...) oil all over my face. Never went back to using wipes or other stuff.
Double oil cleanse and maybe some micelluar water after to make sure it's SQUEAKY clean. *v* best highly recommended

1047 2018-03-18 21:36:22 Oh! Oh! I Know! Lets release half our strategic oil reserve and manipulate our tariffs to crash the Russian economy tomorrow as an election present to Putin. Isn't that basically what Reagan did, caused them to overextend then crash their economy?
1048 2018-03-18 21:36:19 Solidarity with real democracy in Venezuela.  If you want oil, get out your wallet and pay the people — or do you only deal with thieving plutocrats? (Please read a history book, I beg of you. Please!)
1049 2018-03-18 21:36:15 IMO key is bigger.  If China can print CNY for oil, we can throw all the IMF's FX reserve adequacy math on China right out the window.  It cannot have an EM Bal of Pmts crisis, b/c it can always print CNY for oil.  Huge deal for CNY & most CNY bears aren't watching this at all

1063 2018-03-18 21:35:01 I simply do not understand how/why this is such a difficult concept to grasp, unless it militates so strongly against a fondly held strong-dollar thesis that some willfully refuse to see it.

The CNY/oil contract doesn't need to gain much market share to achieve its purpose.
1064 2018-03-18 21:34:36 The chinese importers would definitely want a chinese deliedeliverable contract so they can manipulate large paper oil markets via a relatively small physical delivery market.
1065 2018-03-18 21:34:32 Are there legit people out there that don’t know how to change there cars oil? Lol

Even OPEC can't claim to know how much Dubai contributes to UAE's quota since Dubai became a net oil importer.

1079 2018-03-18 21:31:46 When we do run out of oil you will remember Groove and Sharepoint workspace.
1080 2018-03-18 21:31:45 When SGEI opened in Sep-14, gold/oil ratio rose fr 13x to 30x in < 4 months.  In the 40 yrs prior to 3q14, gold rarely traded >20 barrels/oz.  Since 3q14, gold hasnt traded < 20x - ie there's already been a re-rating as China's uses gold to gain the ability to print CNY for oil.
1081 2018-03-18 21:31:40 Indeed - however, as long as you have oil, water system is lagged, logs for wood stoves etc, you can get through this.
1082 2018-03-18 21:31:21 Most of us support oil. The so called 'movie stars' do not represent America, and certainly not Texas.

Also, if CNY oil price falls, China's current account increases, making them more solvent, not less...see what's happening here?

1133 2018-03-18 21:22:43 Hey, @marcorubio , why did you wait til now to say something? Why are you and your colleagues so afraid of the buffoon - in - chief? He's nothing but a snake oil salesman
1134 2018-03-18 21:22:37 Laundry  Oil Change  car washed swept and cleaned out 
It's been a productive day
1135 2018-03-18 21:22:23 Gearbox leaking oil onto clutch, had to take it out
1136 2018-03-18 21:22:19 This is so important.  The only thing standing in the way of a stronger move to electrification is the still emerging field of energy storage.  Government's should take the oil subsidies and invest them into storage technology research.
1137 2018-03-18 21:21:57 Of us. People like doing deals with me because they know I dont. Like it or not, oil is the home of the brave.

1141 2018-03-18 21:21:12 The boobs on a boy using tea tree oil are redundant.
1142 2018-03-18 21:20:58 End of the first period and the Oil Kings are 5/5 on the powerplay, so I wondered what the WHL record for PP goals in a game was.

Turns out it's 10. Well, nevermind then...
1143 2018-03-18 21:20:52 Gearbox leaking oil all over the clutch 
1144 2018-03-18 21:20:50 Not gonna lie if u only oil yourself up with gasoline you’re the only one that would die nice try though btw idk how you gonna fuck me with your bussy
1145 2018-03-18 21:20:48 Still having bought my oil painting supplies 
1146 2018-03-18 21:20:32 Women are like soil without them niggas can’t grow but we burn through them like some oil and feed pollution to they soul
1147 2018-03-18 21:20:29 If I’m gonna be doing this cooking thing for the fam, I’m gonna need to buy some olive oil. I’ve been substituting it with vegetable oil. Or does that even really matter???
1148 2018-03-18 21:20:08 I used to work for an oil major sorting their global agreements/contracts for goods & services. These took months to negotiate & a forest worth of trees in paper work. Is there a platform that’s going to replace this sort of work?
1149 2018-03-18 21:19:57 Well it’s certainly a great start to the season gearbox leaking oil on the clutch 
1150 2018-03-18 21:19:50 The reason Jay Inslee weighed in this week on Kinder Morgan was because he's getting an earful from his constituents about the exact same concerns people have here. You're right the Salish Sea has a lot of old coal & oil infrastructure. That's not a reason to build more.
1151 2018-03-18 21:19:47 The oil industry and its well paid mouthpieces are trying to invoke a faux nationalism by framing this as a choice between Canadian oil and foreign oil.
1152 2018-03-18 21:19:40 It's single farm cold-pressed tangerine olive oil.
1153 2018-03-18 21:19:32 I’ve been in Mro for a while and Apc cop - can’t believe xom is $75 again with oil $60+? Huge drops in cvx too. Unbelievable
1154 2018-03-18 21:19:24 In January, China imported oil products for 1.5 USD and exported oil products for USD 2.1 bn. Total net exports are just USD 0.6 bn. However, for some categories China is an  net importer e.g. condensates.
1155 2018-03-18 21:19:09 If she can't support her country. Shut her valves off & deny her all products made from oil. That will encourage her to think real quick. No heat. No gas. No car. No bike. No campfire. No tent. No lawn chair she is sitting on. No cooking utensils. No medication. List goes on..
1156 2018-03-18 21:19:00 See yous lot get oil or something on the end of your nose as a natural shihiter we have to put it on lmao
1157 2018-03-18 21:18:50 For the pipeline. Connect Canada coast to coast with our own oil
1158 2018-03-18 21:18:44 put it on last. retinol cream, moisturizer then the oil.
1159 2018-03-18 21:18:31 My dream is to die drowned in coconut oil
1160 2018-03-18 21:18:15 I will fuck you without a condom and oil myself with gasoline and light a match we dying with my dick inside you dont come at me with that shit ever again.
1161 2018-03-18 21:18:14 Oil subsidies help low income consumers. Everything they purchase gets transported. Sometimes those low income consumers even need to heat their homes. How can you not know that?
1162 2018-03-18 21:18:13 Mun tattauna da wani top oil man. Yayi mana justifying wannan zaman hotel din. 
Abun perspective ne.
1163 2018-03-18 21:17:54 My uncle has Gbm and has been put on a morphine syringe, however he’s still eating and drinking, he had been on the oil but can’t now because of the morphine. He’s gone downhill rapidly and I believe because of this. I’d like to stop the morphine and put him back on oil???
1164 2018-03-18 21:17:34 too much oil or not the right strained tomatoes
1165 2018-03-18 21:17:27 I appreciate the knowledge u dropped in your video cause I was jus about to use coconut oil as a makeup remover. Is hemp seed oil cool as a moisturizer?
1166 2018-03-18 21:17:22 Castor Oil is actually a cleansing oil. It’s a base ingredient in a lot of Oil Cleansers for face. It’s great to use it on your scalp for dryness & increasing blood flow for growth! It’s even good for to take in internally!
1167 2018-03-18 21:16:42 Not to mention your dandruff all momentarily goes away. And no more oil. You don't use all your shampoo. Etc.
1168 2018-03-18 21:16:40 Is there any guy that has never suffered heart break???
1169 2018-03-18 21:16:35 Rewatched ‘Skyfall’ the other day too; forgot how beautiful the cinematography was! A bit clichéd but still gorgeous. Plenty of stills could be oil paintings hanging in a gallery.
1170 2018-03-18 21:16:20 Lotion then some kind of oil
1171 2018-03-18 21:16:17 Venezuela had toilet paper and baby food in 1998 (year Chavez was elected) despite oil being only half the current (inflation-adjusted) price.
1172 2018-03-18 21:16:14 Yesss zeker! ik heb chronische rugpijn & schouderklachten because big boobies, vermindert gewoon binnen 30min-1uur after taking the oil. ik voel me vaak licht in me hoofd + knallende hoofdpijn wnnr ik ongesteld ben, geen last van wnnr ik de olie gebruik
1173 2018-03-18 21:16:04 No, I think right now you’re in my mentions defending American oil imperialism and environmental damage and I can’t for the life of me think of why you won’t just say the Americans are as bad as Alberta or worse
1174 2018-03-18 21:16:00 It is not just the west. By insisting on extracting and selling oil to foreign corporations and governments, you affect me as well as the rest of the world. It is no longer possible to isolate yourself.
1175 2018-03-18 21:15:59 I'm a woman and I love Star Trek, and so does my (male) business partner and bff. We have an Star Trek oil painting hanging in our law office!
1176 2018-03-18 21:15:52 Wasn’t Berman let go from the Oil Advisory Group last June?
1177 2018-03-18 21:15:46 Whip together 3 cups cake with 2 cups eggplant. Mix in Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve a la mode
1178 2018-03-18 21:15:45 He just watched his family eat French Toast while he ate egg whites fried in peanut oil over a lightly toasted rice cake. That'd drive anyone mad
1179 2018-03-18 21:15:32 My natural scent is weed and coconut oil.
1180 2018-03-18 21:15:31 Witch hazel and tea tree oil literally saved my face
1181 2018-03-18 21:15:30 Caking takes two eggs, a cup, some oil & water creating messes and bakes.  minus one & messes no bakes!
1182 2018-03-18 21:15:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1183 2018-03-18 21:15:13 help stop oil polluting Bay   @SenBillNelson @RepTedDeutch #ProtectTheInlet We know how horrible oilspills r #deepWaterHorizon
1184 2018-03-18 21:15:03 Hey, Russian oil companies have a vested interest in how to affect American elections, obvs.
1185 2018-03-18 21:14:55 Castor oil is so sticky though 
1186 2018-03-18 21:14:47 You have discovered a planet. It is rust. It is mega. It is excellent. The breeze is airy and has the smell of oil. Pack your hoody.
1187 2018-03-18 21:14:38 u need some coconut oil 
1188 2018-03-18 21:14:32 I would agree with you if we were still in Umudike when I knew you wasn't so exposed 2 Bias but had genuine intelligence. 

1. Luxembourg is Richer than US bt don't produce or export Oil.
2. US is more developed thn Russia, bt Russia produces more Oil.

#GreatestUmudyke
1189 2018-03-18 21:14:31 You seriously do not know what you're missing out on. U haven't tasted fried plantain until you've fried it in virgin coconut oil
1190 2018-03-18 21:14:17 Well I’ve gone through the EIA data for overall Alaskan production and it’s lower than 600k so there can’t be more oil than is produced coming here. It’s probably in the 480k-ish range. That’s just heavy crude though. You are correct about fuel barges, etc also playing a role
1191 2018-03-18 21:14:17 No, bit off bagged  nitrogen , but mostly oil industry, tower cranes , abnormal loads bit off machinery . Uk , Europe. On way to Isle of Skye with part off tower crane at moment. The weather must be playing havoc with your spring work this year !
1192 2018-03-18 21:14:05 getting my oil changed and my biggest worry is that they’re going to tell me I need a lot more work done on the car ._.
1193 2018-03-18 21:14:03 Dee..I've just returned from Walmart..our U.S. equivalent to your Tesco..you'll be happy to know that the Vinegar was with the Condiments..No Virgin Oil in sight..
1194 2018-03-18 21:14:00 If y’all don’t stop putting coconut oil on y’all face...
1195 2018-03-18 21:13:49 Dubai became part of UAE in 1971. Prior to that it was a country. However it's planned non dependence on oil and investment into building infrastructure happened earlier when Dubai was a country.
1196 2018-03-18 21:13:47 There has always been snake oil salesmen and those willing to buy it.  And for some reason a fascination with poop.   Darwin needs to settle this.
1197 2018-03-18 21:13:45 For sure... data is and was the new oil but like Standard oil, they are now entering a riskier phase
1198 2018-03-18 21:13:29 100 years ago there were roughly 60,000 Jews in the land of #Israel 
70 years ago there were over 700,000
Today there are over 6,500,000 
Futurist #Bible #Prophecy is true and it is happening now. 
Get that oil in your lamp, #Church.
1199 2018-03-18 21:13:18 Why not focus on promoting renewable solutions instead of fighting oil? If/when renewables provide a reliable & affordable solution, supply and demand will take over.
1200 2018-03-18 21:13:11 Fulani Herdsmen killing people..
Igbo kidnappers killing people..
Igbo drug barons killing people..
Yoruba ritualists killing people

Since the crime is now synonymous to some tribes, let's keep shaking this table by tagging #CrimeAndTribe 
1201 2018-03-18 21:13:04 Was that when oil supplies where cut miners along with other workers where been withheld investment steel workers railways etc infavour for foreign imports reap what you sow please read some truth in your life hope you and  your family are coping
1202 2018-03-18 21:13:00 Your MCM uses anointing oil as lubricant 
1203 2018-03-18 21:12:55 i am this week cos it’s minus 5 and our oil ran out so we don’t have any heating HELO
1204 2018-03-18 21:12:48 Are those the kayaks made from oil byproducts? Probably sitting in their neoprene suits, drinking from plastic bottles. 
1205 2018-03-18 21:12:45 
1206 2018-03-18 21:12:42 “never mind the fact that Alberta’s oil was already the most environmentally friendly petroleum in the world.” ???
1207 2018-03-18 21:12:30 It’s a 1/5 on the comedogenic scale. Don’t use Jamaican black castor oil on your face though, not the same
1208 2018-03-18 21:12:28 More time for Twitter posts with no worry of deletion!!
1209 2018-03-18 21:12:23 Not just NRA (include $$ from oil & gas sales to terrorist states, too), but NRA $$ will probably be the one that pisses people off the most.
1210 2018-03-18 21:12:21 Without oil, there is not enough food for everybody. As easy as that.
1211 2018-03-18 21:12:17 They say: these are our lands, go away there are no gold, oil, gas or diamonds we do not want to end up like the natives !!!
1212 2018-03-18 21:12:10 Oooh sounds yummy. never fried in coconut oil before
1213 2018-03-18 21:11:52 @jiffylube wow I never been talked out of having an oil change before  who cares if it’s an hour wait!? #4465
1214 2018-03-18 21:11:45 @rhettandlink I’m an Esthetician(skin care) in Nevada and Arizona and I would love to sell your beard oil in my home business after facials. Can I get a deal on a case of it?
1215 2018-03-18 21:11:43 @LukeGromen In 2014, I thought oil dropped due to fracking.  You're saying OPEC switched to selling in a different currency?
1216 2018-03-18 21:11:39 However, today was not without injuries. First, Mother slipped on some ice but nothing severe happened luckily. Then, while preparing dinner, some hot oil shot itself away from the frying pan and onto my hand...in result giving me a burn...
1217 2018-03-18 21:11:37 put some coconut oil around ur bussy right after u shave it. it’ll do numbers
1218 2018-03-18 21:11:32 Countries who heavily depend on oil for revenue are working on diversifying their economy, unlike Nigeria.
1219 2018-03-18 21:11:26 So you acknowledge that the land scarcity argument as a mathematical impossibility to do anything is snake oil?
1220 2018-03-18 21:11:24 LMAO, we lost manufacturing for a myriad of reasons, any person paying attention would be fully aware of this. The economy, the dollar, the oil manufacturing, and so on. None of which had anything to do with socialism. Neo-liberalism on the other hand... 
1221 2018-03-18 21:11:15 If a company sells olive oil AND the ideology IS about the olive, then fine, since it IS relevant to the product.
BUT, WotC sells a products based on ROLE PLAYING, not REAL LIFE.
WHY are they "implementing AND(the important part) PARADING" diversity/inclusivity?

1222 2018-03-18 21:11:11 I understand Putin is a thug, he’s just an irrelevant thug outside of Russia/former Soviet states. The future of oil is poor, the future of Russia is poor and Facebook click bait and Twitter trolling only goes so far...
1223 2018-03-18 21:11:10 @linklamont @rhettandlink I’m an Esthetician(skin care) in Nevada and Arizona and I would love to sell your beard oil in my home business after facials. Can I get a deal on a case of it?
1224 2018-03-18 21:11:08 I do most work around the house either in gym shorts or boxers now cause I've ruined enough with bleach, paint, oil, shellac, sealer... It always sucks
1225 2018-03-18 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: no crust with damp coconut oil and spinach.
1226 2018-03-18 21:11:05 Water and coconut oil are the answers to everything

1233 2018-03-18 21:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this March? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.

1235 2018-03-18 21:09:39 The point is it's big enough. No new infrastructure pipelines or oil expansion

1237 2018-03-18 21:09:27 No one ever wants to put too much oil in their car engine and many don't understand that chronic #overnutrition leads to too much #fats inside the cells, causing #inflammation & diseases.
Here is a mechanic advise: if you ran too much oil too long, you have trashed your engine!
1238 2018-03-18 21:09:15 WHY DOES COREAU SLIDE LIKE HE HAS COOKING OIL ON HIS PADS  #DETvsCOL
1239 2018-03-18 21:09:07 woah castor oil for your face???
1240 2018-03-18 21:09:06 Let's go Oil!!!!'
1241 2018-03-18 21:09:05 vegetable oil
1242 2018-03-18 21:08:55 Oil products aren’t going away because extracting the raw material is bad for the environment. Once the tech is available the market will shift over time. You cannot turn your back on a province (Alberta) because you don’t like what they are producing.
1243 2018-03-18 21:08:46 Also like to pat dry the steaks before the salt and pepper. Olive oil in the pan to sear as well.
1244 2018-03-18 21:08:26 jojoba oil is very nice too
1245 2018-03-18 21:08:10 You are right about the difference. Oil and oregano aren't on subs. Damn, now I'm getting hungry...
1246 2018-03-18 21:07:57 Im either going mad or CBD oil is really helping me sleep properly through the night 
1247 2018-03-18 21:07:54 寝てないから若干吐きそう
意地でも吐かないけどな
1248 2018-03-18 21:07:40 Even if coconut oil doesn’t clog your pores (despite it doing that for most people) there sooo many better oils out there. Ex: Rose hip, castor, sunflower, sweet almond, baobab. Coconut just doesn’t have the fatty acids or vitamin a like others
1249 2018-03-18 21:07:19 And wil tomchuk scores the GWG from Fort McMurray Alberta and oil baron alumi once a baron always a baron

1252 2018-03-18 21:06:58 My forehead makes so much oil i could fry eggs on it so that's the part i wash, really. My cheeks just get the run off cos they are downstream.

Before December I washed all of my face in simple soap always every day with no bother for almost 42 years. Bizarrest thing ever.

1255 2018-03-18 21:06:37 Perhaps we all should do more to stop all kinds of bad projects but just fighting  one massive billion dollar project is hard enough. 

That being said dignifying conspiracy theories about environmentalists being Russian agitators or oil industry shills is ridiculous.
1256 2018-03-18 21:06:24 they are supposed to be doing "the peoples business"...instead get enrich themselves on things like oil!
1257 2018-03-18 21:06:13 How many Black owned banks in our community plan to open branches in Sub-Saharan Africa and London to make Black folks compete at the global stage when it comes to infrastructure and investment in oil, gas and agriculture?
1258 2018-03-18 21:06:11 Another thing which is very soothing for dry skin is 'double cleansing' - you use an oil on your skin first, gently rinse that off with a wet flannel, and then use a cleansing cream as normal. I try and do this every day in winter to avoid getting dry/chapped cheeks and lips
1259 2018-03-18 21:06:05 I just don't like the thought of letting go of that much food supply to a foreign country.  Our dependence on foreign oil is bad enough
1260 2018-03-18 21:06:01 There’s a growing demand for oil?What about this”climate chance” crusade?Shouldn’t we stop using oil to make the world a better place?Sounds to me,like the hypocrite brigade is out in full force!Great to see we get taxed for this nonsense! While other countries still spew it out
1261 2018-03-18 21:05:55 Then let’s talk about his great cabinet picks ! How about climate deniers the own oil companies and heart chemical companies to head to EPA ? Betsy divorce a billionaire who never went to public school to head our education system , the list goes on and on
1262 2018-03-18 21:05:30 Give me your oil to me , lol 
1263 2018-03-18 21:05:17 Are you making a case against the pipeline? You are aware the pipeline is meant to export even more Canadian oil?
1264 2018-03-18 21:05:11 The masseuse took a look at me and decided to bring in the big guns. Just had a cannabis oil (and some other oils) massage.  Have u tried it?
1265 2018-03-18 21:05:04 coconut oil, any green tea face wash and drink 78 water bottles a day
1266 2018-03-18 21:05:02 Buzzing I won £100 worth of CBD oil from #Entourageeffect via a Facebook competition. Happy days 
1267 2018-03-18 21:04:55 Put castor oil on ur stomach then put the heating pad
1268 2018-03-18 21:04:42 Us & nato are morons -idiotic all bc their western hegemony is failing and for what - oil, gas another failed state - millions of lives destroyed more immigrants - people in charge need locking up. RF won't stand by - get the message U hve been told
1269 2018-03-18 21:04:33 Ban foreign buyers and market starts crashing overnight. 50% down within a yr. You are the one selling snake oil by telling everyone that’s impossible to do anything.
1270 2018-03-18 21:04:29 Of course the other option is secede from Canada, join the USA & make them an energy superpower with that same oil.
1271 2018-03-18 21:04:23 I smell of olbas oil lol
1272 2018-03-18 21:04:12 We’re so far behind we think we’re ahead. The world needed an oil producer to reduce its production supply to stabilize the market price for oil.

1281 2018-03-18 21:03:25 Run out of heating oil...that's me off to fucking bed in a hat, scarf and gloves tonight then! 
1282 2018-03-18 21:03:19 Well, I support this, and I encourage you to go public anyway, with whichever media or activist groups you can get to cover the story. In my experience working in government it's best to go straight to the top or go public. Squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1283 2018-03-18 21:03:19 So it's ok for you to use oil, but it's wrong to transport oil to fulfil the demand that your use creates? #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

1285 2018-03-18 21:03:05 You know asphalt is made from oil right? Why would we buy it someplace else to make roads here? Why should Albertans continue to sell oil to only one customer that gets a nearly 50% discount when we can make a healthy profit selling to overseas markets?
1286 2018-03-18 21:02:45 i don't believe this. Putin wants Canada's oil held back. He wants a weak Canada under Trudeau if he even cares. Conservatives seem to be more aggressive towards him than Liberals. Except for Freeland.

1304 2018-03-18 21:00:48 This absolutely happened when my ex husband used tea tree oil full strength. Anecdotal evidence to add to other case reports.
1305 2018-03-18 21:00:29 They did it. They really did. A point shot squeaks through Schneiders 5-hole. Probably should have had that one. Oil Kings 5/6 on the PP so far and there's still 2 min left in the frame.
1306 2018-03-18 21:00:26 Interesting to note that vegans claim that Oreos are vegan. But they're not. They have cross contact with milk, and they are made with palm oil. While palm oil is obviously not an animal product, the palm oil industry drove the Sumatran orangutan to near-extinction.

1331 2018-03-18 20:56:25 I've just found it on Amazon! The thing is tho - I don't have oily skin. I always assumed I did, bc acne, but actually, turns out it's sensitive and dry. So I'm not using any astringents on it anymore, bc they actually make the skin swell up & react more. Hence: Tamanu oil :)

1415 2018-03-18 20:40:39 You will have the Lord's favor. Hold on to your oil. You don't have to prove yourself to people. God is on your side. Are you dangling on the edge? Step back & things will happen for you. Folks can drag you, but not throw you. Step back. Get your faith up. God's got you! - PJFH

1420 2018-03-18 20:40:06 Olive oil and veg stock. You can use non-dairy Flora too. And sprinkle with some nutritional yeast, which tastes better than it sounds and adds a savoury, cheese, slightly nutty flavour.

1422 2018-03-18 20:39:52 allow me to disagree... blocking the pipeline is hugely symbolic to Canada & its energy strategy. 

it could force us to adopt a Norwegian style royalty, divestment and EV strategy. or French renewables obsession. or China w solar.

if oil sands don't expand, the world benefits.

1425 2018-03-18 20:39:25 My go to cure? Mario Badescu buffering lotion. It is a MIRACLE. I’m also using rosehip oil at night twice a week and loving how my skin feels afterwards.
1426 2018-03-18 20:39:08 So I went to Walmart today to buy some oil and washer fluid for my truck. And after I checkout the guy offered my receipt i said no thanks. I went along to the exit and this old lady takes my stuff and says you can't leave without a receipt...

1434 2018-03-18 20:37:16 I use coconut milk oil! My hair doesn’t get as frizzy and my curls are 10x better
1435 2018-03-18 20:36:29 Yes. It does correspond with a change, whereby 
- in the PP years (i.e. Clinton), he was defending the economics profession from outside snake oil merchants, 
- to the post-Bush years (at the NYT) where he was chiding the profession for its response to the GFC.

1441 2018-03-18 20:35:50 BP

US Oil

Shell Oil

Tesoro

Phillips 66

These are the five companies who own the American refineries that flooded the Salish Sea with tankers for decades. 

Why are they never mentioned? Where are the divestment campaigns for them?
1442 2018-03-18 20:35:43 The debt will rise and fall just like oil does   When oil is high it makes anyone look good   We are 40 yrs behind in infrastructure,schools, hospital repairs, roads should have been taken care of long ago !
1443 2018-03-18 20:35:37 No one will sell oil at 30bbls/oz. if they really prefer gold, they can sell oil for dollars at spot and use the dollars to buy 35% more gold.
1444 2018-03-18 20:35:34 And many people boomerang back.

One family I knew long ago boomeranged after a year, leaving one oil company for another, and were able to move into their old house as if they’d never left.

I do not want to be lied to while being called collateral damage
1454 2018-03-18 20:34:12 my business risks are basically zero because I use oil burner really often so if that won't work they won't go to waste :)
1455 2018-03-18 20:34:05 What’s the value if there’s no success though? I agree in principle, but Hall, Kopitar, and MacKinnon were more important for their teams this year than McDavid was for the oilers, because the oil were never in it. Nothing to be gained from his presence.

These "troll farms" also posted about Oil Spills... And this counts as them trolling to influence an election? I mean, that's stated in the article...

This is getting pathetic.

1461 2018-03-18 20:33:14 I seriously want to bathe in the aftercare serum the dude that did my tattoo last night makes. Not only does it smell fucking fantastic, but it has CCBD oil in it, so my whole arm just feels numb instead of inflamed and in pain.
Holy shit 
1462 2018-03-18 20:33:07 It already has Yuan agreements with many oil producers. Also, what’s this got to do with Gold? And also, just because futures exists doesn’t mean they will be traded due to non-fungability of yuan for general oil market
1463 2018-03-18 20:33:00 macronutrients! carbs aren’t bad for you. you actually NEED a lot of complex carbs to maintain healthy energy and body mass, it’s important to reduce simple carbs and sugars, and stick to healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, etc. & it’s likely you’re not getting enough protein.
1464 2018-03-18 20:32:56 Not concerned about the oil on it?

1470 2018-03-18 20:31:45 Retired people are the biggest benefactors of the revenue generated by the oil and gas sector,as more people retire the added revenue generated by getting market price will help fund our seniors getting a better quality of life.She is literally biting the hand that feeds her
1471 2018-03-18 20:31:32 I mostly stick to not using a full brand for all my products, so like I'll have a different oil brand, the cremes like curl definers and leave-in conditioners will be another brand, and then anything i need for moisture. Which can be expensive, but I think it works for me.

1475 2018-03-18 20:31:17 traded 4 hours a day, compared to 23 on ICE and CME...if it gains any traction (which I highly doubt) they would use it to sink the price of oil for their own benefit ...which would be exacerbated by the bounce in USD that is forthcoming
1476 2018-03-18 20:31:16 They sacrificed a lot and they have a lot of land and oil to show for it. They have more than they have ever had. They should just leave everything west of euphrates.

1483 2018-03-18 20:30:20 Sadly blood money

It was part of a British Govt oil holdings

But a court case effectively voided the agreement

& the UK/US kicked off a coup to retail control

But it is likely they ended up as part of BP

So you might want to ask BPs registrars or a (few) stockbroker(s)

1523 2018-03-18 20:24:08 If COMEX/NYMEX = 22 bbls/oz & CNY is 30 bbls/oz, means either oil up, gold up (ie USD down) or gold flat, oil down (USD up, China's current account surplus up).  CNY oil contract means China can manage current acct, means cannot have a BoP crisis bc can print CNY for oil.

1541 2018-03-18 20:22:03 Brother I RT everything I can from @SPEEDSPORT and love watching the races you have on lucas oil tv ..Plus I tell my buddies to buy the online subscription like I’ve done. It’s a great value.
1542 2018-03-18 20:21:40 Yea, Ive heard of 2 strokes. I also know of the turbojet ignition that is used. Oil/carbon fouling has been one of the issues with DI.  I wouldnt doubt if the flame holes in the injector/plug module could see build up.
1543 2018-03-18 20:21:36 took my car into the shop to get an alignment and an oil change.. leaving with news that over 700$ of work needs to be done to my car .. i want to die. thank u god for credit cards

1546 2018-03-18 20:21:17 Just as a note if you need dressings, duo derm hydrocolloid bandages leave a layer of something that feels like sugar set on your skin. It was horrible to remove even using oil.
1547 2018-03-18 20:21:08 Infowars is selling conspiracy theory and snake oil “medicine”. They can say what they like. But it’s not journalism or remotely close to what the guardian and the Scott trust which oversees it does. They are entirely different things
1548 2018-03-18 20:21:02 I need a nap. I thought this dove commercial said their soap contained “semen oil” but it said “Sea Minerals”

1551 2018-03-18 20:20:50 I do - find less oil is better - took me ages to get the hang of it :-)
1552 2018-03-18 20:20:44 This is a false equivalency logical fallacy as well as ad hominem, and it may mean he's not coming to the table with unclean hands, but it doesn't have anything to do with the argument against oil and gas companies or their responsibility for climate change.
1553 2018-03-18 20:20:35 Can you remember a time when the olive oil in your kitchen wasn't jizzy? I can't

1558 2018-03-18 20:19:55 If CNY is convertible under the oil contract (as I've heard it will be) & gets some volume, then when combined w CNY gold contracts in SGEI/HK/Dubai, China will have the ability to control the int'l trade value of the USD via mgmt of the gold/oil ratio.  Let's watch...

1563 2018-03-18 20:19:05 These statistics  speak of The WHEN not IF fact of oil leaks.  How many signatures does it take to stop these?  Those petitions were ignored by big money.  The possible rate of undetectable spillage WHEN it happens will contaminate The Missouri River And connected rivers.
1564 2018-03-18 20:19:00 Black castor oil or the laxative? I’m legit considering this suggestion.

1574 2018-03-18 20:17:15 The United States was never an ally of the Kurds. The U.S. is only  looking to project its power and the Kurds had a use for that. They  wanted military bases in Syria and to cripple Syria's economy by  sitting on its oil wealth. The Kurds are no longer needed now.

1592 2018-03-18 20:15:20 The number of U.S. jobs in solar energy overtook those in oil and natural gas extraction for the first time last year, helping drive a global surge in employment in the clean-energy business as fossil-fuel companies faltered.
1593 2018-03-18 20:15:13 Like oil and water
1594 2018-03-18 20:14:57 Hope you browned the bubble an squeak nicely in butter (browns easier than oil).
It's an eternal temptation and to be honest, could eat that (w/ an odd egg or mushroom) until I died 
1595 2018-03-18 20:14:40 Put some washing up liquid on it and use a toothbrush or your finger to work in the soap. I’m pretty sure washing up liquid is an emulsifier and breaks down oil to make it mix w water
1596 2018-03-18 20:14:38 15   you poured hot oil on your junk and made it all blister   now showers aren't happening....

1608 2018-03-18 20:13:18 Well, I stated at the beginning of the tweet that my comment is just to do a factual correction. And I did. I did not make any comment about the validity of how we have not used our oil wealth to develop our country more than we have done.

1615 2018-03-18 20:12:43 Why can't the Syria government destroy the oil fields in the east!
1616 2018-03-18 20:12:36 More likely the collapse in oil prices. And lack of pipelines

1623 2018-03-18 20:11:21 2) I think he's going to demand elimination of all sanctions, under threat of use of the new weapons & his cybercontrol of our systems.

He wants sanctions gone so as to free up that trillion$ in oil he had a deal pending w/Exxon to develop.Their economy is so dependent upon oil.
1624 2018-03-18 20:11:12 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1625 2018-03-18 20:11:11 the American oil memes are so stupid but so funny
1626 2018-03-18 20:10:37 I suggest that you read some industry reports that detail how even a small dent in oil demand will cause the price of crude to tumble instead of getting horned out on the current price of crude. Clueless arrogant albertans, living in a world of fantasy
1627 2018-03-18 20:10:36 What oil products have you given up? My guess is none, that makes you a hypocrite.

1638 2018-03-18 20:09:19 I think the only reason Tillerson got that job was because the Orange Clown thought he could weasel his way into that Oil Deal Rex signed with Putin and when he found out Putin was playing him his feelings got hurt, GOOD !!!

1641 2018-03-18 20:08:50 The Catalans and other Spanish have just as much in common. Nigeria will hold together as long as oil money lasts - or can pay for an army to enforce unity. With US and Spain, the nature of the rifts are different.

1649 2018-03-18 20:07:29 @orengo_james How do we tackle unemployment of citizen; equitable resourse allocation. service Kenya's debt, brain drain, poverty and to ensure every Kenya participates effectively at right position in its economic agenda. Bills to harness discovery of oil etc is center stage

Tomatoes: remove skins if possible, chop; add to the other veggies in the pot, add 1/2 teaspoon sugar and a pinch of salt, saute covered for 15 minutes

1659 2018-03-18 20:05:38 Those steaks look overcooked and they are literally swimming in the oil in that pan.
1660 2018-03-18 20:05:27 Treating China with protectionistic trade policies instead of subsidies is still wrong. Again, a country with the polulation the size of the US, not to mention their foreign interventionistic policies does imply that they need domestic production of steel, much like oil.
1661 2018-03-18 20:05:25 if u don't brush or wash a double coated doggo then the dead hair forms a really tight layer near the skin that traps skin flakes, oil, and other dead hair. Eventually a mix like that forms a mat, but the precursor is often called "packed" hair or fur

1674 2018-03-18 20:03:36 Is it possible the launch of this CNY/oil contract is merely coincidental with rising US/China tensions? Sure. But if there *IS* a connection, I submit it has far less to do with oil (for now) than it does with gold. Therefore, let's watch what happens with the gold/oil ratio.
1675 2018-03-18 20:03:32 Mommy woke up this morning and said she’s feeling to make a oil down today. She got up, made it and she’s now serving me.  Let me grab my bib. 

Wow. Wow. How did I get so lucky?

1679 2018-03-18 20:02:56 this weekend I learned that coconut oil can be used as lube and is often considered better than your typical water based lubricants due to its anti-fungal and antibacterial properties. WOW IS THERE ANYTHING COCONUT OIL CANT DO????????
1680 2018-03-18 20:02:47 Water and Oil don't Mix
1681 2018-03-18 20:02:43 Oh! That's me! Just me, I think. I roast them in a hot oven with sweet potatoes, carrots, other root veggies, w olive oil and salt.
1682 2018-03-18 20:02:36 Yes. They need to squeeze every dollar out of oil.... But @CocaCola doesn't need to play along. They can change.
1683 2018-03-18 20:02:34 @AngelFaceDGAF is not playing about her coconut oil

1 onion
1 carrot

1685 2018-03-18 20:02:03 How much energy is (was) there in 1.8l of engine oil?
Why do EU road vehicles have to feed all breathers into the engine inlet?
1686 2018-03-18 20:02:00 Oil period is going to be burned whether it's CDN oil or from elsewhere. The demand ain't going anywhere soon. Why would you rather Saudi Arabia get that money from China instead of us? I pick us. Every. Time.
1687 2018-03-18 20:01:54 Albertans will not forget in 2019! Knotley until very recent opposed pipelines and wanted to keep our oil in the ground. Only when her pie in the sky naive plans blew up into her face and her job is on the line, she suddenly is a pipeline crusader. Rank opportunist!!
1688 2018-03-18 20:01:50 >The same Russian online troll farm that meddled in the American presidential election has also taken swipes at Canadian targets, including oil infrastructure and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Literally the first sentence.

1705 2018-03-18 19:59:26 Of course, no commercial interest, they prob have already been tapping that for yearsssss. Now the oil vultures show their greed in politics. But we know, thanks to #FreePress It’s really unbelievable. Algorithms are meant for ads/sales, not false, hurtful propaganda.

1707 2018-03-18 19:59:23 I encourage your movement, it's fair. The policy of a country musn't to be the matter of any other country. Less if they fly over your country to kill your innocent people and steal your oil and change your policy this is call Colonisation from the sky.
1708 2018-03-18 19:59:08 So. I've noticed I only like my FB foundation when I add argan oil drops to it. Otherwise it almost just sits on my skin. I'm so sad to have discovered this, too. The color match is perfect but the finish isn't my favorite.

1720 2018-03-18 19:58:18 I for one want to know what the Mercer’s and Zuckerberg were doing with the Russian oil industry. Did they want the sanctions lifted?  It’s what they got when Trump took office?  What did they receive?

1727 2018-03-18 19:57:00 Perhaps. However, it *may* prove to have ramifications far beyond a lightly traded futures contract if, as rumored (albeit not established, yet) it proves to be easily convertible to a CNY/gold contract. Let's see what happens with the gold/oil ratio over the next several weeks.
1728 2018-03-18 19:56:58 Have you tried leaving coconut oil on it overnight?
1729 2018-03-18 19:56:54 doesn’t for me I just use coconut oil!
1730 2018-03-18 19:56:47 He’ll be mad at the vet for that one  I’ll oil them once or twice a year, but I am not going to be the one who removes them. Nope. Not me. Not ever.

1732 2018-03-18 19:56:37 I haven’t had carne asada in months because I refuse to eat that stove top bullshit y’all cook at home with oil n shit on a comal. I’m marinating, prepping with time/love and drinking beers by the grill today. This evening will be perfect 
1733 2018-03-18 19:56:34 LOL Trinidad and Tobago's government pays for our tertiary education so almost everyone here has a degree. We also have resources like oil and enough money for free health care and the water service is just fine but hey lmao whatever makes you sleep well at night.
1734 2018-03-18 19:56:16 @realDonaldTrump don’t forget American oil companies were in Russia helping extract oil once Russia knew how the expelled American oil companies i was there watching stupid America giving away technology and know how Stupid greedy American globalist that was Tillerson I bet

1737 2018-03-18 19:55:26 He has zero interest in political stability on Russia’s borders!
Ukraine ring any bells?
Crimea?
He wants chaos in the west (and Middle East) so he can take back the former Soviet countries and secure more of the world’s oil
That’s why he helped push Trump & Brexit
1738 2018-03-18 19:55:22 Prolly cause it’s priced like oil.

1744 2018-03-18 19:54:00 Just as it was at Standing Rock, the Water Protectors warned of the danger of oil leaking from the Dakota Access pipeline & they were dismissed as alarmists. Within 2 months there was a major spill. I hope the Coast Protectors will be taken seriously.

1748 2018-03-18 19:53:20 I think the LNG problem is wicked b/c it’s intertwined with oil production and refining. Methane capture, though, is mostly about maintenance procedures. We could solve that one if politicians and regulatory bodies had the will to deal with it head on.
1749 2018-03-18 19:53:11 What happened to the proceeds of your oil?
What happened to the proceeds of Norway's oil?
Lees people, less tax plus more money needed for infrastructure as distances are far. Somehow they manage that.

1753 2018-03-18 19:52:49 Its pathetic why don’t we ask what is the interest of putin to raise the price of oil, so Russia can pay his citizens to

1789 2018-03-18 19:47:30 That's not how it works. Food is still grown by people, and increasingly by machines. Without economic blackmail to make people build oil pipelines, we can use those human resources for good projects people want.

1814 2018-03-18 19:44:18 Oil spill is so horrible.  
My experience was with the air pollution in Port Harcourt. On Friday last week, when it rained heavily, I put a bucket outside to collect water, sooth water kept filling the bucket for 1hour,  then I knew this city was in trouble.
1815 2018-03-18 19:44:07 No, I don’t. because Petro is based on the price of the oil, a commodity that right now is decreasing on their sales price, as well as that level of the corruption that the country has, leaving with no credibility for investors to realize business with this currency.
1816 2018-03-18 19:44:06 That would amount to one more oil tanker a day to what has been going in and out of the port for how many years...
1817 2018-03-18 19:44:05 My wife & I were there in February.  So, so somber to see it in person.  Guide said they estimate fuel & oil will still seep out for another 70 years.
1818 2018-03-18 19:44:03 Yeses this gentlemagic oil guys. Don't sleep on it .

1819 2018-03-18 19:43:53 Fully agree. It’s going to be inherently less corrupt, because you can’t monopolise the sun or wind - unlike a coal mine or oil rig. Probably why some vested interests are so against it. I like S H’AC ‘s writing - he’s a very sensible guy.

1827 2018-03-18 19:43:18 What do you not understand? These men devoted their lives to public service. Sorting out the good from the bad, the lies from the truth. Protecting our country and living with a code of honor. Trump has spent his whole life lying, selling, promoting. No honor. Just snake oil.
1828 2018-03-18 19:43:17 It smells super good kinda like baby oil but fresher if that makes sense
1829 2018-03-18 19:43:08 Tenn could really had just said that he is worried about RIku instead of putting oil to fire when they fight XD
1830 2018-03-18 19:43:02 In the Port of Seattle, @kindermorgan is shipping in the dirtiest form of oil - #tarsands. Today, dozens of kayaktivists are here to say #StopKM! Let’s have an #OilFreeSalishSea

1832 2018-03-18 19:42:56 How is it incorrect? Are u taking the oil reserve as the amount produced per day? Because what u shared showed about 2.9million barrel per day just as he tweeted...
1833 2018-03-18 19:42:51 Uh dermatologists say it's perfectly fine to use coconut oil as a makeup remover and it's also perfectly fine to use Shea butter on ur skin, everyone's skin is different there are no sweeping rules u can state as fact and as an esthetician u should know that
1834 2018-03-18 19:42:42 Social license is obtained every time someone uses a car, buys groceries that get delivered by a (diesel) truck, goes to Mexico on vacation by airplane or takes a public transit (diesel) bus. Users demand oil. Without demand, there would be no oil supply. @jkenney @RachelNotley

1858 2018-03-18 19:40:09 Family Nutrition: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this March? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
1859 2018-03-18 19:40:03 Yeah, because that has worked out so well in Germany. Not to mention, poor countries depend on oil and coal. But I guess they don't matter in the scheme of things..... Right?
1860 2018-03-18 19:39:59 Gotta get oil change before lol
1861 2018-03-18 19:39:50 Wait so Rex Tillerson who ran the largest oil company in the world is not a smart business guy? Yeah I guess it’s easier then putting your name on some shitty steaks and water brands and shitty high rises
1862 2018-03-18 19:39:36 Yes omg but lemme pray that tree tea oil will help
1863 2018-03-18 19:39:36 OH and sometime people also add sesame oil but i didn't have that so i added some sort of spicy oil instead?

...

why do i feel like that screencap of a commentary on a recipe that was basically "i changed everything. great recipe!"
1864 2018-03-18 19:39:27 Someone needs to do an oil painting of this

1878 2018-03-18 19:37:20 The oil price collapsed soon afterwards. They were saved from their own hubris.
1879 2018-03-18 19:37:16 Beware! Bought a @NOWFoods essential oil diffuser yesterday. It did not work straight out of the box. The store, Herbal Connections, will not exchange or return it. So now I have to go through Mfg. They better make it good. GL

Seriously, do a minimum of research.

1901 2018-03-18 19:34:07 You used too much fish oil
1902 2018-03-18 19:33:38 Problem with doing that is when the conditioner and water dry
Your hair will be so dry that when you comb it its painful
So use coconut oil or hair food or even moisturizer

1909 2018-03-18 19:32:39 Correct and rational. And must stop.

It would also be great if Syrians themselves were not digging up these lines to make them larger and pouring oil on it via powerful social platform nor calling for more civil war.

Foreign push, but YOU are the lead actors. Deal with it!
1910 2018-03-18 19:32:21 Dear Catherine, #KinderMorgan #TransMountain pipeline will not be built. Threats to cut off oil flow or to send in the army won’t change the fact that BC is unceded territory, First Nations People are clearly saying NO & there’s no way 2 reverse damage caused by dilbit spills.
1911 2018-03-18 19:32:19 And odds are, the experimental drug you want for Matt is worse than snake oil.  That some have access doesn’t mean others should as well.  If you want to support the terminally ill, you should advocate for fully funding the FDA and NIH

1916 2018-03-18 19:31:37 2/3 Olive oil and 1/3 castor oil mixed and massage into face use a facecloth with warm water to create a steam effect do that a few times and then just wipe off. The 2 oils work together for cleansing and detoxify your face and naturally moisturize.  It is amazing
1917 2018-03-18 19:31:36 This is the same excuse the snake oil salesmen use. I appreciate RCT is perhaps not feasible but nonetheless without independent evidence it remains nothing more than a good idea - as at the time was leeching :)

1919 2018-03-18 19:30:56 I feel like it’s okay to use once in a while , not like a daily thing. But i use a lot  argan oil products, macadamia nut products, or anything with nuts in general. And of course the basics, coconut oil, and aloe, i don’t know the names atm bc I’m not home but I’ll lyk later !
1920 2018-03-18 19:30:53 I blocked the man who believes in Russia oil deals monopolies chemical murder and acts of war as amusing or was he just trying to move that obese body around the golf course.
1921 2018-03-18 19:30:35 I agree re 59.5 completely and I think once that goes 55 may not hold either. However crude likes extremes and just as I expect spx to go to one so may oil.  I’m not wedded to this though.
1922 2018-03-18 19:30:30 Subsidies? Clearly you have never scrutinized the @ENERGY budget (Fossil and nuclear still get lion's share). CO2 tax? All oil major CEOs support placing a price on carbon. Why parrot such #FakeNews talking points when we could find points of agreement?

1925 2018-03-18 19:29:27 When does technological evolution and QC/best practice play a role in your decision making? Are you not proud of the leaps and bounds our scientific and engineering community have made with respect to capturing oil and gas for our betterment? I’m disappointed.
1926 2018-03-18 19:29:25 It's all about spreading anti science & disbelief. How many lobbies do you know that will lose power because of #science?
Oil & carbon vs #ClimateChange.
Industry vs CO2 emissions.
Recycling vs programmed obsolescence...

1936 2018-03-18 19:27:46 stop the wind and sunshine, I think big Coal, Gas, Oil, and Uranium are working on it.

1938 2018-03-18 19:27:42 Which ones Iraqi, Turkish or Syrians?

Basically nobody wants them. They're not liked by the Iraqis and Turkey has a monster of a problem with them.

The Americans were happy to let them stay in North Iraq to guard the oil fields for them, but not sure what's happening there now?
1939 2018-03-18 19:27:42 Business idea: Meal ingredients in a to go pack. Washed and cleaned. You go shopping at the supermarket and you can buy a Seafood Banga for 5 bag for 5k. Has the oil extract, all ingredients washed and cleaned with the appropriate portions measured in, comes with a free recipe.
1940 2018-03-18 19:27:31 Started with a very low dose and it takes the edge off for a short time, found I could not tolerate a full dose even of the low strength oil it drained an already broken energy supply.

1945 2018-03-18 19:27:01 Then you didn't read the article, which says " this low-income baker is infringing on France’s regulation that mandates at least one day of rest per week." A regulation is not a contract freely entered.

1954 2018-03-18 19:24:20 Olive oil????
1955 2018-03-18 19:23:39 Couple of reasons I voted for Trudeau was the promise of election reform and banning oil tankers off the northern BC coast, so I am VERY disappointed what transpired on ER but happy on the tanker ban, BUT I am not going to do anything that may bring back the HarperCONS #cdnpoli
1956 2018-03-18 19:23:27 It’s all they have. Their countries produce nothing. If they had no oil, they’d be cavemen.
1957 2018-03-18 19:23:18 To say nothing of bilge water discharged by those foreign tankers coming down the St. Lawrence to bring oil to ports. Who knows what's in that? Meanwhile hypocrite cripples Energy East for resources....disgusting, while she lets that sewage flow. Political orders from top..
1958 2018-03-18 19:23:15 Everyone’s having chicken  this weekend. We had it last weekend.

1960 2018-03-18 19:23:08 I had just enough coconut oil left to drench my hair in it. Now i get to look greasy for the next few hours
1961 2018-03-18 19:23:08 That is precisely right. He’s owned, otherwise he’d show his tax returns. That is probably the only thing he cares about in terms of image: money. Without it, he has nothing. Just a snake oil man. And then his base would turn on him.
1962 2018-03-18 19:22:59 @cRcKosher in 2014 u said that pompeian grape seed oil did not require Pesach certification. Still true?
1963 2018-03-18 19:22:56 Thank you for your concern guys.. Please enough of this gist. If you have anything to say kindly quote the tweet. God bless you all
1964 2018-03-18 19:22:52 I’m still loving this frankincense oil mixed with bay oil... the aroma is intoxicating
1965 2018-03-18 19:22:48 They’re a pretty good precedent on how the oil money fairytale will eventually work out if and when the club structure isn’t developed to the absolute highest level. Not a crash, but performance level fading little by little. It’ll probably happen to City too.
1966 2018-03-18 19:22:44 It's not enough thou  . Do you know how much is cooking oil ? Alone nje
1967 2018-03-18 19:22:20 I would roast at high temp with olive oil.  Or steam and then dress with lemon juice, olive oil, and capers.  Delish.
1968 2018-03-18 19:22:06 Yesterday encountered BD w/visibility down to 1/4 mile from E-W oil field lease roads in Pecos Co.
1969 2018-03-18 19:21:59 1.Dont put coconut oil on your face. Clogs your pores.
2. Sugar has giant particles that just scratch your face worse.

1978 2018-03-18 19:20:42 I predicted that Western attempts to back Kurdish separatism in Syria will unite Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq together. If the US keeps occupying Syria, the SDF will splinter. Turkey will leave NATO. Syrian forces will fight for Al Omar oil fields. The Yanks are in a tight spot.
1979 2018-03-18 19:20:36 A true Sunday vibe: blasting music through the house while cooking curry chicken and rice, dancing, and deep conditioning my hair in Jamaican Castor Oil

1985 2018-03-18 19:18:33 Do y’all have stock in the coconut oil market or what?
1986 2018-03-18 19:18:07 I got shadow ban yesterday for calling Trudy an SOB for putting sanctions on Canadian oil but nothing on Saudi or Venezuela oil.
1987 2018-03-18 19:18:07 Had only been aware of this outcome in boys who had ingested a lot of tofu or products/protein pwdr containing soy. Not so many guys into aromatherapy + many commercial lavender scents are synthetic. Can't figure out how ess oil of lavender became a thing for adolescent boys.

1994 2018-03-18 19:17:03 Turkey allowed ISIS fighters to trade oil, cross their borders and use their hospitals whilst Kurds and other refugees suffered, Turkey are now actively partaking in these killings #BreakSilenceOnAfrin.
1995 2018-03-18 19:16:46 Remember one thing, Muslims/Pakistanis dint have world War 1 and 2, we dint kill millions, we dint attack Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Who attacked and killed are real terrorists. They are only selling weapons and getting free oil from these countries and drugs
1996 2018-03-18 19:16:43 not really ...but Oil 101 by Morgan Downey is a good book...a bit technical ...but if you like that...you will like this book

2006 2018-03-18 19:15:21 The avocado is high in vitamin E so substitute these high vitamin E with almonds, apricots, spinach.  It might be worth trying out organic extra virgin avocado oil. no real  replacement for avocado, too unique. a nutritional replacement of sorts  can be had with olive..
2007 2018-03-18 19:15:15 I love adding healthy fats to my salads! I add a 1/4 sliced avocado and a light dressing made with olive oil, lemon juice and herbs... so healthy and delicious! #SugarFreeChallenge

2009 2018-03-18 19:15:01 They also talked about the TYPE OF COCONUT oil and how that makes a difference in the likelihood off it clogging your pores, ie how it’s processed. Something you didn’t discuss
2010 2018-03-18 19:14:58 Everyday I find autos driving in wrong side from graphite to hoodi. No police no action. Why?  The are cops standing between graphite and INDIAN OIL  petrol pump,  below tree shade.  Can u please enforce traffic rules with higher penalty and follow up
2011 2018-03-18 19:14:15 I love roast potatoes. I need to ban myself from them. Especially if roasted with garlic and rosemary and a nice bit of good olive oil. *Drools*.

2033 2018-03-18 19:11:54 Green oil requires no death to produce.  The positive karma is eternal life. The karma for black oil is old age and saggy buts.
2034 2018-03-18 19:11:52 I love it. The front looks good and I cut all the bad dead ends too. I also did a avocado, olive oil and coconut oil and yolk mask and my hair is soooo soft.
2035 2018-03-18 19:11:40 You know why USA says freedom and not peace when bombing countries ? Becoz irony would die so hard .

2037 2018-03-18 19:11:23 Why don’t they protest in US where oil production has reached 10 million bpd. Three million bpd alone in Permian. What these morons don’t realize is that whatever decline in production we have, it will be picked up by other countries including Venezuela and Iran.
2038 2018-03-18 19:11:10 Life tip: if you suffer from cystic acne where the blemishes are massively swollen & painful & take ages to subside? I've recently been dabbing Tamanu oil (I know! Oil!) on emerging blemishes am/pm and it has worked wonders to stop swelling & pain. YMMV, but it's worth a go.

2041 2018-03-18 19:11:04 Most people say riders are brave or stupid. You decide  I recall riders continuing racing at the TT despite oil leaks that pissed oil all over the boots etc, but still carrying on. Between the walls. It's called grim determination
2042 2018-03-18 19:10:58 Ignoramus, UAE of which Dubai is one of the emirates produces about 3 million barrels of oil daily with a population that is far less than ours. They used a percentage of their oil revenue to develop their non-oil sector which has led to their phenomenal transformation.
2043 2018-03-18 19:10:57 Mannn chop it off (I know you rolled your eyes at me) and just restart... then don't put any heat... and my growth secret is coconut oil, real shea butter and aloe Vera gel from plant and mix all that up and just use it as a leave in... you can wash it with the aloe also
2044 2018-03-18 19:10:54 'Round my neck of the woods, the worst auto shop is a few shops in the Valvoline chain. I swear they are crooks, charged my mom 75$ to do a 20$ oil change, and every car ive ever worked on after them has had a sign of their sh*tty work.

2046 2018-03-18 19:10:28 Because the point of all this is to remove Assad’s strongest allie: PUTIN! Israel then gets to keep the GOLAN HEIGHTS and take more oil rich land from Syria that happens to have fresh water. And then Israel’s enemy IRAN becomes isolated and alone! How dumb are u?

2073 2018-03-18 19:07:03 As you said its our culture, we liked it, so get your nose out of it, and wait fifty years for our oil to finish
2074 2018-03-18 19:06:59 It has almond oil but i thought cold pressed oils dont promote an allergic response. I just use it and never had an issue. 
2075 2018-03-18 19:06:37 That is stupid to cut off our largest oil supply.

2079 2018-03-18 19:06:26 Underestimated your opponent! Go full strength at Besiktas when you led from first leg 5-0 then rested many important players when you played against one of your rivals. Deserved lose.

2132 2018-03-18 18:59:57 I really wish people would stop pretending Rex Tillerson took the SoS position as a public servant. He thought it would be an excellent opportunity to enable massive international giveaways to the oil extraction business.

2146 2018-03-18 18:57:30 I agree, but don’t include Letestu in that list. He was a good addition to the Oil. Just regressed to the mean.
2147 2018-03-18 18:57:11 Oh really When was the last natural disaster? You’ve got hit with plenty of hurricanes since Katrina and they spilled a shit ton of oil in your water FOH 
2148 2018-03-18 18:57:07 No you believe in carbon taxes and government subsidies.  The US is already becoming energy independent in oil and gas.
2149 2018-03-18 18:57:05 I think you have to oil it down to fix it up
2150 2018-03-18 18:57:05 Would be interesting to know if the Energy East Pipeline was ever a target of Russian trolls. The killing of that project was a loss for Canada, but a victory for Russian oil and for Russian influence over Europe.

2156 2018-03-18 18:56:18 That industry can just ram their pipelines through residential communities astounds me. It proves Canada is controlled by oil interests and not its’ citizens.
2157 2018-03-18 18:56:16 3/ is just no scenario where all those guns will come in useful to defend our country.  It's a fantasy the right tells itself to pump up their feelings of worth, but it's a fairy tale. And a lot of us are sick of people dying so you can tell yourself that lie
2158 2018-03-18 18:55:55 2/w/the Israelis, they'd now possibility be richer than the the oil sheiks. The tech developed in Israel has & will continue 2 fuel that economic engine long after Arab oil runs out (&/or we stop using such a terrible pollutant). They'd also have their own state! Big blunders!

2. Prior to 2016, GOP generally dismiss CA for not having grasp of US electorate because it’s not a US co.

2172 2018-03-18 18:54:21 That means investing a lot of money on an ongoing basis to be prepared for a fairly remote, but inevitable disaster.  Who is prepared to pay for that?  Oil companies? Alberta? BC? /4

2182 2018-03-18 18:53:27 yeah, but you said pork rinds are fine and they have rapeseed oil. so should i just avoid at all? or are there ones with good oils available?

2200 2018-03-18 18:51:05 It is very offensive for Belorussians, Poles, Romanians and Hungarian to compare their leadership to Turkey’s.

2204 2018-03-18 18:50:00 So, I'd start w that and start addressing basics one piece a time. I'd discuss various metrics and components and the frequent errors. The deficit pt is a good one and didn't need oil thrown in to confuse issue.
2205 2018-03-18 18:49:41 trump is a con man & snake oil salesman...the fact that he fooled so many into believing his not surprising...what is most upsetting is that they LIKE what he is selling & think it is GOOD.
Many of US are corrupted & vile to the core.

2216 2018-03-18 18:47:29 When the world is looking for renewable energy why are these people hard selling oil n gas
2217 2018-03-18 18:47:25 I’m sure the foreign oil companies who funded Tides, LeadNow, Dogwood & more to organize these will be pleased. They will be celebrating her in their boardrooms.
2218 2018-03-18 18:47:18 Any speculation that President Trump is considering an attack on Assad's Syria is low considering his stated goal is to get out of Syria after ISIS is cleaned out. He does not want to spend one more dime on the middle east unless he has to. US has plenty of its own oil now.
2219 2018-03-18 18:47:17 please stop putting oil on y’all hair before you flat iron it

2224 2018-03-18 18:46:19 With almost 8 billions ppl on Earth we cannot go and live in caves...oil is bad and ...with out oil will be much more. We spent trillions on arms and wars...more important is to end wars then oil in my opinion
2225 2018-03-18 18:46:11 It’s just ground-up chickpeas with oil and seasonsings—what did you think?

2228 2018-03-18 18:45:50 Stop giving airtime to @GasBuddy #danmcteague its pretty clear he’s in collusion with big oil and @KinderMorgan  why does not a single journalist investigate this?!?

2235 2018-03-18 18:45:21 I thought it was cool that I only had brothers coz then no one would be using my products...and yet between face creams, body scrubs and argon oil shampoos these men keep finding their way into my shit.

2237 2018-03-18 18:45:09 One of the diy that I did twice was coffee scrub. Ran out of facial oil so i used coconut oil but i recoil at the thought of oils on my face on any day so the facial scrub turned to body scrub. Now will limit coconut oil only for my body thanks to this video 
2238 2018-03-18 18:45:07 I love homemade popcorn. air popped if I'm being more healthy or in a pot with a lil oil cuz I love that flavor.

2241 2018-03-18 18:44:24 huh? nah. i just know the actual numbers, and know that they're greener than ICE cars, even with the current manufacturing overhead. but of course i'm falling for the marketing, not those standing behind big oil saying EVs pollute.
2242 2018-03-18 18:44:15 I just re-read "The Calorie Myth". Love most of the recipes. I say most because a lot of them include shredded coconut.  I can deal with the milk, oil and flour, though. The texture in the meat, not so much.

2249 2018-03-18 18:43:14 If we are to make america great again we must help our President, drain the swamp. We can do this by not re-electing the incumbents. Those who have sided with big oil and gas corporations. As well as those tied in with the deep state. We need a new senate and house. No more B/S.
2250 2018-03-18 18:43:13 First stop on my birthday? Oil change. Looks like the air filter is getting replaced as well. Next on the list? Home Depot. Time to buy some tools and hopefully the hot dog dude will be there.
2251 2018-03-18 18:43:01 Best stat from @CERAWeek - Samir Assaf's comment how @HSBC 2017 balance sheet exposure to #Oil & Gas sector is $30B, #Renewables ~$1B. By 2025 green energy will grow to $100B! They are 5th largest bank. Also FSB pressure to line item exposure by 2022. @MLiebreich

2259 2018-03-18 18:41:55 I think All Queda an them are in dire need of a political commissar. anti imperialism is a philosophy we all subscribe to but why can't they take out things like the petroleum giants oil shipments..? what does slicing the neck of a mere agent have to do with anything?
2260 2018-03-18 18:41:38 I tried CBD oil for the first time this morning. I tried to leave it under my tongue without swallowing for one whole minute and I couldn’t.. I started gipping and ended up throwing up because god damn it tasted disgusting!!

2262 2018-03-18 18:41:34 You would think that since you’re oily, you would need matte products to cover it up but really, your skin is overproducing oil to tell you that it needs hydration. Try a hydrating primer to see if that helps. If not, you can just go back to a matte primer 
2263 2018-03-18 18:41:34 Pour some garlic oil in the ear. It has never failed with my kids earaches.

2269 2018-03-18 18:40:40 Even with that if we ever want independence from US fuel then we'll need more refineries which will require more oil. We're just coming full circle. The pipeline is needed.

2279 2018-03-18 18:39:53 Great idea.While you're at it try convincing oil companies to stop making gasoline.

2284 2018-03-18 18:39:22 Already to some extent.  I was looking for a new car and my longtime trusted mechanics said stay away from anything made in Germany unless you like oil stains on your driveway.  No BMW or Benz for me....

2286 2018-03-18 18:39:19 Personally I like @HonestAmish_com products. Their balm is fantastic as is their oil! And mostly local for me!
2287 2018-03-18 18:39:14 Virgin olive oil is good but sometimes you just want to dip your bread in shit that’s fucked before you know?
2288 2018-03-18 18:39:10 Olive oil and castor oil for my face wash
2289 2018-03-18 18:38:59 For soup, cook crushed ginger in oil, then simmer with eggs, curry powder, chicken broth and peas. Top with tarragon.
2290 2018-03-18 18:38:57 Oil is a valuable resource, We probably shouldn't be wasting it for fuel.
2291 2018-03-18 18:38:42 Soon crude oil will become history;citizens of UAE will look back &thank their leaders for foresight,visionary leadership,their accomplishments,& pace at which their nation developed.
Nigerians on the other hand will gnash her teeth at how they were plagued with accursed leaders.

2294 2018-03-18 18:38:07 Same logic applies to literally every emitting activity in the country. We do not have a plan for how any of it fits under our target. There is zip different about an oil sands pipeline.
2295 2018-03-18 18:38:07 Anybody arguing coconut oil is good for the face is just ...voided lol
2296 2018-03-18 18:38:05 US fracking is a lot of oil but cost is high so oil price must be up enough for profit. Fracking is a terrible thing 4 the environment. Oil has had a terrible hold on the world & created terrible destruction to climate,environment. Seems like human bent on self extinction.
2297 2018-03-18 18:37:30 You can buy your clean water and oil from U.S. in Syrian Kurdistan part.
2298 2018-03-18 18:36:51 Hahaha bjp gandu party hai
2299 2018-03-18 18:36:51 Totally ignores the foreign money funding the oil industry, funding the Conservative think tanks like Fraser Institute, ignores the money flowing to universities to try to cast doubt on the science. Yep, for Chuck it seems to count only if it's the "other" folks doing it.
2300 2018-03-18 18:36:21 1/ I assume rhetorical question. But 4 the normies: original plan was 2 divide  into 3. Northern segment w/oil fields 2 go 2 then-ally . Southern segment w/natural gas 2B annexed by . Baghdad left 2 starve 2 death, cut off from means 2 buy food.
2301 2018-03-18 18:35:46 Don’t DM me if you can’t change a tire or change oil in the car.
2302 2018-03-18 18:35:26 Veggie curry potato pie sounds ace. Ditto triple cooked chips. Are they fried in oil or beef fat? And what shape are they?#PieAreSquare ?
2303 2018-03-18 18:35:15 This will change USA is going to be petro exporter when they stop importing oil ...$ will nosedive and this will whipp 21 trillions USA depth Chaina currency with gold backing will take over
2304 2018-03-18 18:35:14 The only thing that grows my hair is benny and Betty 2 lines and castor oil. That means... wig all the way. These funky hairstyles can miss me
2305 2018-03-18 18:35:06 Or the press/media who thought ut was all a joke & fun times in 2016 & before. Who helped people like Chafetz in his anti-Clinton campaign to get a GOP in that would break up Utah National Parks so they coukd sell the rights to miners, oil, & gas. Luv to see his bank acct
2306 2018-03-18 18:34:42 Should Protestors of the oil pipeline in BC Face a penalty if caught and ID by big brother or police, Have their Sources of income suspended or Cutoff. Im talking Welfare, EI, CPP, Pensions, Disability and other

2308 2018-03-18 18:34:20 Things my painting professor said that I still don't understand:

Nothing in an oil painting should be in the center. Everything must be off center. No central focus point ever.

"You need to composition BEFORE painting." "what's composiiton" "JUST COMPOSITION FIRST"
2309 2018-03-18 18:34:09 Put off getting my oil changed until the last possible moment of spring break wow
2310 2018-03-18 18:34:08 we managed to put the literal snake oil salesmen out of business for selling either worthless or harmful "remedies" in the 20th century...now we have a new brand of grifters in "alternative" medicine and "alternative" facts...this is horrifying
2311 2018-03-18 18:34:03 and justine will do aĺl that he can to insure canada will import oil even though we have enough to supply our needs.fucking wanker

2325 2018-03-18 18:31:47 No one is threatening oil works. It's purely market conditions and industry practices.

Oil production in Canada is at the highest level in history.
2326 2018-03-18 18:31:27 Sunday confession: I wanted something different, luxurious and spa like. So I lit up few tea lights and candles, run the shower on my usual eco set up but didn't turn the fan on, few drops of lavender oil under the mat and lights off. Voila, spa #ecofriendly #natural #lovelife
2327 2018-03-18 18:31:21 Naruh cleaning oil-nya Biore di kamar mandi adalah keputusan yang tepat. Di saat males pake kapas+Bioderma, cleansing oil + foam cleanser adalah efisiensi waktu dan tenaga saat ke kamar mandi.
2328 2018-03-18 18:31:11 Or using Solar to extract more oil
2329 2018-03-18 18:31:08 Totally didn’t create an age bubble in healthcare when you walk into a hospital and majority of Nurses are 24-30 or 50+. Nope, just a figment of our imagination. Also who knew there’d be an infrastructure deficit after green lighting every major oil proposal in the 90s?

2335 2018-03-18 18:30:33 A second pipeline beside the first , 7 times the capacity. The bitumen is then stored in a massive new oil tank facility in Burnaby (at great risk in earthquakes) and then sent by massive new tankers under 3 bridges into English Bay & out into Georgia Strait
2336 2018-03-18 18:30:23 I would fry more but I always worry how to dispose of the oil after and how to mitigate the hot oil smell pervading the house?
2337 2018-03-18 18:30:19 It has been many moons since I have had a nice long hot shower followed by fully annoiting my self in delicious smelling oil. HIGHLY reccommend.
2338 2018-03-18 18:30:14 We’ve been building bridges between the North and the South. The SW have finished theirs, so have the SS folks. And this isn’t even about ND oil (or Dangote refinery) or party politics.

2344 2018-03-18 18:29:37 an acquaintance of mine was in her house when that pipeline burst spraying oil all over her home & somehow causing scarring on her face. I don’t think she cares whether it was human negligence rather than the pipeline itself failing.
2345 2018-03-18 18:29:32 I've been making great power and drifting my exact set up for 6 years so try again with your bogan spec cam bearing spinning, oil starving, rod throwing, bent pushrod having ass.
2346 2018-03-18 18:29:19 Took car for oil change today. Had to go buy a new air filter as they were out, got a discount for no other reason than cashier was from Uruguay and saw my LFC license plate. #winning
2347 2018-03-18 18:29:05 You have that right. But we do not have to be SOCIALIST to be better.

2348 2018-03-18 18:28:57 @EggSlutLA @TheBurgerShow @HJBenjamin Idea for the "Fly Me to the Moon" burger: What if you added a plantain fried in dill-infused oil (or fried and topped with fresh dill)? In a pinch, a banana would also work (still crescent-shaped). And heck, why not: horseradish Gouda spread?

2351 2018-03-18 18:28:37 Trump knows enough of what Mueller knows, and has concluded that undermining the integrity of the FBI and Mueller is his only hope.  The facts will convict him but the master snake oil salesman will still try to convince his base that the Deep State have 'created' FAKE facts.
2352 2018-03-18 18:28:20 The sewage plant is being built now. It is debatable that it was actually necessary but we erred on the side of caution. A tar sands oil spill would be catastrophic..not debatable. Not able to be cleaned up either no matter how much $$$ is spent.

2355 2018-03-18 18:27:31 Any #artists know of a good website to buy oil and soft #pastels? I’m a bit of a beginner. I’ve been on a lot of sites but not sure which way to go. #Art
2356 2018-03-18 18:27:30 There are subtle ways to liquidate someone, no need to use a chemical agent that points to you, just before the presidential election, world cup, plus the economy is already struggling due to sanctions and low oil prices and you are a signatory to #CWC. But hey, who cares right?
2357 2018-03-18 18:27:22 @silkdynastystx conflicting views on oil all around... we lean bearish still yeah.
2358 2018-03-18 18:27:19 Been sniffing this peppermint oil for the past 2 hrs trying to get rid of a headache just to realize it was bc of my ponytail being too tight
2359 2018-03-18 18:27:18 My dogs know the words “cannabis oil” and come running when I say “come get your cannabis oil”. Oops wee druggie doggies
2360 2018-03-18 18:27:13 The irony is that the paid protesters used plastic zip ties to tie themselves to the gate. These fools don’t realize that plastic is derived in part from oil. SMH
2361 2018-03-18 18:27:11 Orange Juice helps. That's my medical opinion.  Also your body cleans you out by sweat and digestion, that's a good way to think about keeping healthy.  And body oil helps, especially if you're older.
2362 2018-03-18 18:27:09 Had @GovInslee proposed to close the much higher tanker traffic #WashingtonState #CherryPoint #oil refinery from where, in 1988, 875,000 litres of tar-like Bunker C fuel killed birds & coated shores from #Oregon to Dungeness Point, he would be more compelling.#bcpoli #notankers
2363 2018-03-18 18:26:38 Bring Lewi on.
2364 2018-03-18 18:26:37 I got this new body oil and I’m in love with it. It smells so good
2365 2018-03-18 18:26:36 What is mind boggling is that this tyrant abuser of power is now the only one who can protect Russia's oil from saudis stealing oil. saudis want Russia's oil bad. Real world is hard cold + unkind.
2366 2018-03-18 18:26:30 So the oil leak I see is from the seal apparently since my transmission pan didn't have one. Waiting on a ride to get more parts.
2367 2018-03-18 18:26:24 Aswear even me too,on my project defense day my breakup came
2368 2018-03-18 18:25:55 髪をおろしたパー様かっこいい(四コマ読みながら)
2369 2018-03-18 18:25:53 Nope,check your dictionary and thank me later after you delete it
2370 2018-03-18 18:25:32 If you've got oil changing problems I feel bad for you son;
I got 99 5 gallon buckets but I can't find 1
2371 2018-03-18 18:25:21 That’s what happens when you engage in the world’s atrocities & evil  my friend. When you just sit on your oil rich hands, your nose never gets bloodied. Yet that is also why so many are fleeing the despots of the Muslim / Arab world to the GREAT WESTERN WORLD!
2372 2018-03-18 18:24:57 The main ingredient in my new "bee friendly" weed killer is clove oil,  so my front yard now smells like 1985.
2373 2018-03-18 18:24:57 Oil???  what the hell be going down 
2374 2018-03-18 18:24:35 That is being dealt with even though it is debatable whether or not it actually was a problem. That a spill of tar sands oil would be catastrophic is not debatable.
2375 2018-03-18 18:24:35 The neck oil helped too burnsy. Nice way to spend a freezing Sunday afternoon
2376 2018-03-18 18:24:33 Me: yea you can use coconut oil for anything it fixes skin, hair,ecs.
 Friend: so can I put it my relationship to fix it too .                    Me:LOL yea maybe not everything
2377 2018-03-18 18:24:32 Got my oil changed yesterday on my car and I feel v adult. 

My car. MY car. My CAR. Even though I don’t drive it it’s my car. 
2378 2018-03-18 18:24:28 there was no good reason Russian Oil Company CEO was interested in #CA analytics of American people unless that CEO was fronting for Putin.

2382 2018-03-18 18:23:46 Asetrad y Aptij nos van a echar un mano para trasladarlo a la OIL.
2383 2018-03-18 18:23:44 Bout to drown my hair in this wild growth oil and hope for a miracle
2384 2018-03-18 18:23:28 Chelsea fans can shut the fuck up without oil money you’ll be playing counting Tranmere as a final

2389 2018-03-18 18:22:06 Same here it was just that God has been faithful, during those times love would have been d cause of me kicking d bucket
2390 2018-03-18 18:22:02 Yup - and the article blithely talks of UK oil imports halving as a result. Really? What do tractors, lorries, ships,   trains and 'planes run on? And the electricity for the cars will be generated ... how?
2391 2018-03-18 18:21:51 Do you have to have wipes? Because I use an oil free liquid thingy and I use a towel or a cotton pad... especially for my eyes
2392 2018-03-18 18:21:50 I'll throw something else on fire. MSM cranking up a bit on China too. Russia & China are backing their currency (just 4 trade,not sure) with gold which is a huge threat to the US petro $. If u look at Iraq,Saddam tried 2 sell oil for Euros. 1/2
2393 2018-03-18 18:21:49 Really? Oil isn’t just about energy Gus. Do a little research on what Oil does and is an ingredient to. Also, explain the wind and solar air travel, and ship transportation. Oil is needed now and in the future. Get over it. Improve oil technology.

2395 2018-03-18 18:21:41 I work in a steel mill we make pipe for the oil and gas industry. With the red tape cut more pipe will be needed
2396 2018-03-18 18:21:27 Rubbing alcohol & coconut oil does the trick
2397 2018-03-18 18:21:27 Doesn't fish oil give people super diarrhea? Also no mahney! :C I love you too but I hate what you've become (the capitalism thing also I'm kidding lol)
2398 2018-03-18 18:20:59 The real question is why there are so few good RCTs evaluating interventions. Should NHS staff pushing TEACCH, for example, be struck off while they wait for 1 decent trial? Hardly...but until then choices can look like different flavours of snake oil.
2399 2018-03-18 18:20:52 No it’s not Christmas, I just smell like peppermint oil.
2400 2018-03-18 18:20:49 Fyi- Hoppes #9 gun oil is great for oiling a Zebco 33 reel....
2401 2018-03-18 18:20:24 castor oil is good for inflammation!!
2402 2018-03-18 18:20:20 Make sure you put a drip pan under. We don’t wanna see any oil on the ground!
2403 2018-03-18 18:20:18 In a roomful of children, Rick Snyder fails to persuade President Trump that international bankers are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Ann Coulter
2404 2018-03-18 18:20:04 I rub tea tree oil on my memories
2405 2018-03-18 18:19:52 I ordered mine online thru target but they sell it at gnc and stuff just make sure it’s pure rosehip seed oil
2406 2018-03-18 18:19:51 You can't seriously believe that in a VERY short time Tillerson WON'T be back at EXXON Mobil???
He now has extremely SOLID Russian oil connections..
EXXON is lusting after more contracts!
2407 2018-03-18 18:19:44 That the more educated you are, the more able you are to recognize Trump as a snake oil salesmen.

The guy compained on build the wall, not power of the people. Xenophobia won it for him. Talk to old white people.
2408 2018-03-18 18:19:36 but these are like super vitamins with fish oil and all sorts of other shit in them as well
also I won't go away cause I looove yoooou

2410 2018-03-18 18:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
2411 2018-03-18 18:19:24 She prefers pouring oil on all other Syrian groups. The show is better that way.

2414 2018-03-18 18:18:48 That giant mess in Alberta may give you guys a clue as to why we have our reservations about allowing you to play oil in B.C. too. Also to suggest that people trying to prevent environmental disaster are traitors is kind of gross. Don’t you have enough money Brett? #bcpoli
2415 2018-03-18 18:18:47 You are deluded,,UK went to illegal war for oil,,do you think they will let scots vote indy then just walk away with their`s.
You will see the real WM when it comes to losing that 92%,they will fight to keep by whatever means,they don't care for you just the resources
2416 2018-03-18 18:18:44 Has to be put in context the FSA took entire area all the other towns and no evidence of looting other then driving a tractor or taking olive oil bottles so is this major or minor issue
2417 2018-03-18 18:18:34 The death of Iran's nuclear deal could set oil bulls loose:VERY SOON MORON TREASONOUS "KOCH"-SUKKA ain't gonna have anyone left of his hoods to blame but himself !!!

2423 2018-03-18 18:17:28 Go to Lush Cosmetics there's one at the Sherman Oaks and Topanga mall and ask for the tea tree oil one. If u have acne/oily skin tea tree oil is good for that and what toner basically does is remove all the dirt you missed while washing your face
2424 2018-03-18 18:17:24 She breathes stagnant, pungent reeking ache clouding the streets. it roils blood to the point where the pinpricks poking through skin are miasma; ready to infect and bite worse than the bark. legs drag. She haunts the streets like an oil stain where a painting once laid.》

2429 2018-03-18 18:16:55 Same applies if I'm getting an oil change, or yard work done, or whatever. Lemme know what I'm paying for and then I can decide if I want to move forward. It's not an insult, it's due diligence.

2434 2018-03-18 18:16:03 @HeatHeroIRL any products for people that have only an oil burner?
2435 2018-03-18 18:16:00 BTW, "reality" is not something you "check into," like a Trump hotel.
2436 2018-03-18 18:15:56 Way to start my morning: accidentally poured olive oil into my coffee. Good thing it floats.
2437 2018-03-18 18:15:40 As it stands, our nation's landfills are overflowing while our oil reserves are rapidly depleting.
2438 2018-03-18 18:15:06 Hi Brother, what is Turkeys plans in Syria. Why doesn't Turkey help Assad to remove US forces from Menbij and Rebels from Syria. Why was Turkey traffiking Syrian Oil.

2441 2018-03-18 18:14:37 Putin funds his country through oil and weapons export, we NEED to remove his power. 

How?

Putin is TERRIFIED of green energy, renewables and a united European/ western front. When we no longer need Putin/middle eastern oil...

Their funds dry up and wars STOP!

UNITE, go green
2442 2018-03-18 18:14:22 I think you might be projecting, and your cheque comes from big oil. Perhaps you would feel better if you found a way to earn a living in a way that did not accelerate the demise of the livability of our planet.

Your still going to marry us Somali men, so here’s some advice. The average bidaar needs coconut oil for a smooth salaax, so practice on your bidaar salaax skills haye?
2448 2018-03-18 18:13:42 Jeez :( guess after all that it can't hurt to try a drop of lavender oil in some warm water.
2449 2018-03-18 18:13:40 So appreciated.
2450 2018-03-18 18:13:31 As to what’s wrong with your statements, you state as fact supposed subsidies to oil and gas companies that really don’t exist. So called renewable energy is impractical and not cost effective.  Ask the animal activists what they think of wind power, ie killing birds
2451 2018-03-18 18:13:31 So I along with my oil patch brothers and sisters I say to all the tree hugging hippie protesters “your all welcome for your way of life so unless you want to live like a caveman stop whining about oil and gas!

2456 2018-03-18 18:12:02 'act outside the law'... i am sick of this rule of law sh*t when the corruption is so clear:
- NEB hiring former KM consultants
- oil industry 'donations' to BC Liberals
- rushed NEB hearings, no crossX, suppressed evidence...

these broken laws are far, far worse...

2474 2018-03-18 18:10:33 i know this is an old tweet, but pork rinds are usually friend in rapeseed oil. do you mean we should look for ones fried in lard/butter or is the rapeseed oil not much?

2476 2018-03-18 18:10:22 Yes. Maida is refined flour with all the goodness stripped.
Bran and Germ have fat and by removing that, the shelf life of Maida improved a great deal. Otherwise after milling, the flour will go rancid fast. Now corporates sell the bran oil back to us stating its healthy....
2477 2018-03-18 18:10:13 I wear that as perfume. *weird silence where everyone blinks* ...The essential oil. I mean the essential oil.
2478 2018-03-18 18:10:10 I thought that it was common knowledge that lavender oil could do this.

2482 2018-03-18 18:10:06 I absolutely hate this idea. Non-renewable resource revenue (NRRR) is for all current and FUTURE generations. We have a duty to prudently invest. 

Best way would be to put 100% of NRRR into the Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Reinvest interest earned until oil is no more.
2483 2018-03-18 18:10:01 Ahh that’s a shame, do you have any links I can read up on to see what type of / brand of cannabis oil she was using? My cousin has late stage cancer including lung and stomach and I would like to try and do some research re the cannabis oil treatments
2484 2018-03-18 18:09:58 Charming American Soldiers Obama gov sent to steal oil from Africa's orphan children who are defenceless. To give to saudisWhoClaim they produced oil! Stay tf away from them. In Africa U.S. is my enemy. They are being sacrificed by US gov. To be punished in death for hurting kids
2485 2018-03-18 18:09:53 No such thing as ak57 hon. And it STILL is one trigger oil, one bullet comes out.
2486 2018-03-18 18:09:49 Or you can take CBD oil daily and not deal with this at all!
2487 2018-03-18 18:09:47 Nah id go.  Just another career politician.  Putting money ahead of ppl.  We need tories and red tories out.  Had enough of all the wars they have over oil or supplying weapons to dictators and she'd be no different!

2494 2018-03-18 18:08:38 The analysis is actually what the two countries in comparison have been able to do with their oil outputs, no matter how small or how big

2504 2018-03-18 18:07:11 Adolf Hitler will not be remembered for his great oil paintings. Although I can’t imagine that Trump even has any artistic skill. A monster is still a monster.

2523 2018-03-18 18:04:42 They have winter & most other things sorted there. Heated pavements etc. 
That’s what happens when you don’t waste all that North Sea oil money!! 
Enjoy.
2524 2018-03-18 18:04:29 So now that there aren't any protections you aren't going to be worried about your family? You want them to shower in poisoned water from oil and mining companies? Contamination?
2525 2018-03-18 18:04:28 My enemies was anointed to push me into the cave. THANK YOU!!!!  The cave processed me to hold the OIL.
2526 2018-03-18 18:04:27 Seems coconut oil is the one

2535 2018-03-18 18:03:23 Ordering supplies. Some oils are very poor quality but I made my oils with the best products I could afford. The massage oil is a surprise. All the cheaper essential oils smelled like chemicals and burned. I couldn't use them. A small loss. #Business #beauty #Oils

2541 2018-03-18 18:02:20 I kinda wanna bleach the parts of my hair that are mad but I also don’t wanna do a coconut oil soak beforehand sooooo
2542 2018-03-18 18:01:45 Dad’s idea. We had a family biz in oil&gas. New investors took it on. We didn’t make much money from that. Sisters and I still  worked there but big sis had a falling out with management which spelt the end for the rest of us. We all switched to farming and property development.
2543 2018-03-18 18:01:44 Why do you always think you dont look anything, we are all different and yes some are born beautiful and some arent oil paintings but you have a wonderful personality and i think you have alovely face so there you go, enough said..xx

2547 2018-03-18 18:01:36 I never said that, They want to split #Syria because of #Israel. The oil is a side note.
2548 2018-03-18 18:01:31 Not to ramble, but subject is interesting. That "important" study from 2009 estimated 50% oil price drop would reduce cpi by < 0.19%. Also, energy component is subdivided bc of how it trickles into costs. It relates to fun debate re recent oil crash impact on retail spend & RPCE.
2549 2018-03-18 18:01:06 you dont need to worry about us - honestly. But we'll be taking the fishing grounds, all the renewables and the oil. Scotland is a very wealthy country. Not all members are  in the euro btw. Then theres EFTA

If I’m taking the FBI with a grain of salt the I’m taking Trump with an oil tanker full of salt. You have a huge blind spot with Trump man.
2554 2018-03-18 18:00:30 Remember! We can do custom oils. Also any of the perfume oils in stock work wonderfully in sonic diffusers and in oil heaters!!!!
2555 2018-03-18 18:00:28 Gee, Trump is a billionaire liberal.  Funny how their hatred for Trump is now more than their hatred for Big Oil and the Evil Exxon!  lol
2556 2018-03-18 18:00:12 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2557 2018-03-18 18:00:10 Yeah. You don't have to regulate all of this stuff if people are able to sue oil companies for spills that effect their property. Owning property along a stream is owning access to clean water.
The same would go for damning up a river.

2562 2018-03-18 17:59:18 Eucalyptus and Peppermint oil mixed together makes for a fresh, calming room. I might have overdone it and created a new shape of Polo mint.

2571 2018-03-18 17:58:25 Well everyone on my feed is now pretty much bullish again because of the algo ramp on tiny volume Friday. Oil is now in contango and MM are slowly reducing position, watch for the pump on open then dump tomorrow.

2576 2018-03-18 17:58:06 Biblical prophecy fulfilling before your very eyes. God has been prepping me for this since I was 14. I pray, save for His Elect, He will extend His Own Time, and bless President Trump to get a handle on this, but I am not going to be caught without oil in my lamp

2581 2018-03-18 17:57:54 Ok, that great, but I will like to know you more, I'm a rig oil and gas contractor. Can we chat inbox privately ?
2582 2018-03-18 17:57:45 If @CNN was as good as they believe they are, they should just give this dude a job straight out of high school. He's on the air more than @jaketapper now. May as well pay him.
2583 2018-03-18 17:57:39 No you set up systems where they cannot work by having the value of your country linked to it's very way of life. Oil will always be worth money regardless of how terrible or life is but if your economy is built on the strengths of its people it cannot be enslaved.
2584 2018-03-18 17:57:35 Do you know if the mushroom stall is on social media? The soup we got from him was amazing & we’ve bought some truffle oil from him before!
2585 2018-03-18 17:57:32 lathering your arm pit in tea tree oil works but only for those lightly sweaty days.not for the coming summer though.
2586 2018-03-18 17:57:24 Furthest thing from the truth. You obviously have no first hand experience with the actual oil industry.
2587 2018-03-18 17:57:17 I warm up castor and coco butter oil and massage it into my skin and it be feeling like silk

2589 2018-03-18 17:57:03 Because milk comes from living creatures and it should be worth much more because of the conditions they are in. In fact, humans shouldn't even drink milk.

Plus, gas is a scam. Research the oil hoax.
2590 2018-03-18 17:56:46 Oil was in bottom lane and that’s where @HBurtonRacing wi restart so hoping they get it cleaned up properly 
2591 2018-03-18 17:56:39 I need to get a oil change

2596 2018-03-18 17:55:56 ...then it can still be harmful to themselves. I've seen people with cancer place their faith in cannabis oil. It's hard to make headway against that kind of misguided faith mixed with ignorance. Individually it's not terrible but when peddled by influencers it is dangerous
2597 2018-03-18 17:55:48 Brilliant, well said. Wasn’t it Rockefeller that said “competition is a sin” and he was a real nice guy lol. You have to see @corbettreport docs on big oil /Big data and the Rockefeller’s, awesome work.

2600 2018-03-18 17:55:22 In 1991, President Salinas announces the closing of the oil refinery 18 de Marzo in Azcapotzalco. The shutdown came after weeks of pollution levels in Mexico City beyond the limits established by the World Health Organizaton.
2601 2018-03-18 17:55:21 OPEC, aka the Oil Cartel -- textbook example of a cartel.
2602 2018-03-18 17:55:14 And what if she was? Even not, putting her on that committee may have won over soft support or undecideds to Alberta’s efforts in extracting oil sands and exporting. There’ll never be 100% consensus.
2603 2018-03-18 17:54:59 Are we looking at 2019? Or will it open in 2018? I heard something about a study being done because the tracks go through the oil refinery
2604 2018-03-18 17:54:51 You can use old motor oil to fertilize your lawn? This guy sucks.
2605 2018-03-18 17:54:49 Definitely oil on the track, officials laying quick dry and taking care of it
2606 2018-03-18 17:54:32 And he has been quite successful at shutting down Canadian oil time benefit Russian oil. Trudeau and other liberals bought into the foreign protest hook, line a sinker.  Destroy Alberta, support Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and American economies at expense of Canadians.
2607 2018-03-18 17:54:30 People talking about Trinidad oil money let’s be real that control by the Chinese or Indians so no black person who be talking about oil because unfortunately we deemed the lowest class in Trinidad
2608 2018-03-18 17:54:28 GET OUT OF CANADA YOU LOSERS ! THIS COUNTRY IS VERY MUCH IN NEED OF THE OIL SALES ! WHY ARE YOU NOT PROTESTING ALL THE SHIPS WITH OIL COMING INTO BC PORTS! FROM ALL OVER HE WORLD !
2609 2018-03-18 17:54:21 Tesla battery powered cars and solar roof tiles will hopefully cut down the demand for oil 
and cut down the need for countries to invade/regime changes  smaller countries like Iraq and libya ,Syria for the oil killing thousands of  civillians in the process
2610 2018-03-18 17:54:18 I use rosehip oil during the day followed by sunscreen and then lemon overnight serum in the evening after washing my face
2611 2018-03-18 17:54:13 The tar sands would not even exist if it were not for all the government economic and environmental subsidies. Big oil has given up on the tar sands. It's a blight upon the earth...shut it down! 

Lougheed saw the tar sands as a moonscape with NO benefits to AB!
2612 2018-03-18 17:54:13 Looking forward to the follow-up townhall event to discuss the failure of government at nearly every level involved with this.

2621 2018-03-18 17:53:25 As long as Oil Companies can be held to account (sued in court) for any oil spills that damage other people's property (including property along a water way) I don't care where they build their pipelines.
2622 2018-03-18 17:52:55 If our gas and oil stop we'll have to return to candles and bumbies ... paper usage no plastic bags !!!
2623 2018-03-18 17:52:55 weird how the general orthodoxy up till like 2005 was the war would be over in a hot second, not kill that many people, pay for itself via oil dividends and massively improve iraqis' lives. the flashy TV explosions in 2003 were interpreted by most as if they were CGI effects
2624 2018-03-18 17:52:45 I don’t put it anywhere else on my face, but I definitely use coconut oil to take off eyemakeup. It melts mascara and I’m convinced it makes my lashes longer, but that’s probably in my mind
2625 2018-03-18 17:52:39 @KenyaPower_Care no power Nakuru Landan estate (Nakuru-Ravine Rd)around behind National Oil. Please respond
2626 2018-03-18 17:52:25 Ok smart ass. Tell the extraction cost for a barrel of oil from the Viking field?
2627 2018-03-18 17:52:09 Officials asking about oil. @HBurtonRacing can’t see any and isn’t going fast enough to feel it so not sure what they will do. Some cars had oil on their windshield
2628 2018-03-18 17:51:57 Finally words of consciousness, the rarest asset is USD, not all that jibberish about курсрубля (aka Russian roubles scat rate), remnimby gold and oil trades.
2629 2018-03-18 17:51:41 Win this in second half.
2630 2018-03-18 17:51:36 Who is shocked by this? These are the peeps who buy the snake oil.

2633 2018-03-18 17:51:04 Yeah the whole filming himself slitting his wrists should have ended it there. But they didn’t do anything, so they blame the NRA. Now Michael Moore is here hanging with David Hogg.
2634 2018-03-18 17:50:51 It killed a lot of people in the proces, and forced systems on these countries which the people disliked (very strong free market capitalism and strong liberalism). And the US gained huge amounts of profit (oil) and geopolitical power from the invasions.

2637 2018-03-18 17:50:38 I see a whole lot of clothing products there that require a whole lot of oil to produce and ship...Now think of your options to transport oil.  Think long and hard of each and which is preferred @WBrettWilson

Is looking for commercial support for a growing project in Asia  of legal CBD & CBG oil 5 > 28 %  THC  only 0,075 % . Who wants to ext cancer in this world pl follow !
2640 2018-03-18 17:50:29 Would be interesting to know if the Energy East Pipeline was ever a target of Russian trolls. The killing of that project was a victory for Russian oil and for Russian influence over Europe.
2641 2018-03-18 17:50:28 lmao ken i’m tired g, first coconut oil was a holy grail and now “lol y’all put coconut oil on your face? might as well use dirt” like pick one my guy 
2642 2018-03-18 17:50:27 War with Russia wouldn’t benefit them as much as the destabilization if the Middle East. They profit from the oil,natural gas, and the heroine in Afghanistan. We have seen the opioid problem really grow shortly after going into Afghanistan. They even guard the poppy fields.
2643 2018-03-18 17:50:22 I need Jesus, some milk, coconut oil, a glass of wine. ALLAT. Ya girl is losing it. 
2644 2018-03-18 17:50:13 Lost support for her as a female role model when she became the face of krill oil as an anti-ageing product. Knock-on effects of industrial krill industry have been devastating to Antarctic ecosystem. Our vanity shouldn’t be at the expense of wildlife. #krilloil
2645 2018-03-18 17:50:13 Yes oil has allowed advances. It’s provide energy to allow us to explore many others fuel sources. 
If you want clean limitless energy then nuclear is your answer. Has risks of course but weigh that against the damage that is being done now.
2646 2018-03-18 17:50:09 I already see her reactions, Allah sanya alkhairi
2647 2018-03-18 17:49:57 Lmao ok now we can talk about how yesterday I had oil from the fryers pop on my arm.  funny now but not so funny yesterday lol
2648 2018-03-18 17:49:41 And theyre able to do that because they made billions on oil sales.
2649 2018-03-18 17:49:33 So people should accept TMX because the Americans are shipping oil?  Or BC shouldn’t be friendly with WA for that reason?

Even in kuwait the suadis stopped the oil production in a shared oil field one sidedly to tackle kuwaiti government!

2664 2018-03-18 17:46:41 Canada has the third most oil reserves. Most of it's under forests and fragile areas of land though. A lot of it is also oil sands and other crap that costs more than it's worth. Honestly, where the heck are space solar farms that wirelessly beam energy to earth?
2665 2018-03-18 17:46:36 Not that you likely care, but #PalmOil is the #1 reason that the population is declining for Orangutans , Sun Bears and Rhinos, #JustSaying Palm Oil is not what is best for the environment.

2668 2018-03-18 17:46:28 Having worked in the non-profit sector, I know first hand how how significant the”big oil” contribution was, and is, to supporting charities. A cut at the gov’t level does not destroy charities, it allows the private sector to be more generous.
2669 2018-03-18 17:46:20 Mxm show me a white folk who died fighting for black folks to be free ? Y'all benefited from enslaving our people even now ,look at what America and London r doing in the middle east sending fighter jets killing hundreds or innocent people coz they after that oil

2673 2018-03-18 17:46:05 Norway is a great example of how oil should be harvested. Too bad we choose to follow the yanks.
2674 2018-03-18 17:46:05 It's not a minority. Every poll taken has about 70% or greater in BC are opposed to more oil on the West Coast. None of our provincial exports threatens another provinces resources or their harvesting of those resources.

2683 2018-03-18 17:45:25 Event with electric cars those idiots need oil. It takes 7 gallons of oil per tire....Ride a bicycle ...also have rubber tires unless you use wood wheels...use the train or boats and row it is the only option...walk at your destination...Marchers....

Wonder if they were made with out the use of oil and any part of there production? Shouldn’t you hippies be wearing leaves and mud tied together with vines ?
2686 2018-03-18 17:45:05 Wish every hair care item that I have tried wasn't made with coconut oil. I used to love it but now I am allergic and the last time had a coughing fit. My hair is a dry hot mess now and I don't know what to use. #coconutoil #helpagirlout

2728 2018-03-18 17:39:23 Sorry, but you're stupid or in denial.

EPA Administrator and climate change denier Scott Pruitt has been flying around the country to convene private meetings with oil industry groups – all while flying first-class on taxpayers' dime!

2730 2018-03-18 17:39:05 The correct answer is to split the difference between butter and olive oil and just fry them in a shit ton of bacon fat.
2731 2018-03-18 17:38:47 She has an oil.  But its not helping.
2732 2018-03-18 17:38:27 Always destroyed my stomach, just like B-Dubs, gotta be preperation or the oil theyre frying the wings in cause it puts me for a loop.

the system is so rotten that bank officials are blatantly giving away bank money.
2736 2018-03-18 17:37:46 Oh. Awesome. I would love to explore the castor oil life. Haven't found a light version for my fine hair 
2737 2018-03-18 17:37:43 over-drying can cause those small poppable bumps on your scalp, I don't know if it's acne or eczema or whatever but I get that after I bleach my hair and over-dry my scalp. moisturize it with olive oil or coconut oil and wash it out of your hair- leave a tiny bit on the scalp!
2738 2018-03-18 17:37:43 That isn't going to happen this century, if ever, the production and distribution costs are not insubstantial, other consequences would be a flood of people dumping gas and oil putting yet more pressure on electricity production and distribution.
2739 2018-03-18 17:37:42 The benefits far out way these so called scare monger tactic risks. Like all things - moderation is the key. Tea Tree oil was issued to Australian troops in jungle warfare WW2 as a first aid kit in a bottle and saved many lives.
2740 2018-03-18 17:37:39 On the upside I'm well rested... On the downside I didn't get to oil my hair

2753 2018-03-18 17:36:03 Look, that fact of the matter is that we do in fact refine Alberta oil to make BC fuel. Not all of it obviously. Alberta has been threatening to cut us off. If we don't play ball and loose our supply of Alberta oil then we're fucked.
2754 2018-03-18 17:35:54 Change your oil yourself. Any moron can do it. That way the dealer won’t “find” more things to charge you. #surreybc
2755 2018-03-18 17:35:43 If that happens, we should definitely build that wall with the US and stop shipping any of our precious oil and gas to them.
2756 2018-03-18 17:35:42 Buy solar panels and generators. Or pray karuma and isimba dams work as advertised. Meanwhile, we are getting an electrified rail and heated oil pipeline...

2758 2018-03-18 17:35:32 Rex Murphy: Trudeau is Captain Canada to our threatened steel workers. Our oil workers? Silence. Trudeau needs votes in Ontario or he is at risk of loosing his carbon tax. He’s supporting steel workers long enough to get them to vote for Wynne.

2760 2018-03-18 17:35:22 I hope these leaders will be brave enough to stop the war in Yemen. We need peace. Especially, in the middle east. But I'm skeptical about this, since they're not human centered but oil centered.

2763 2018-03-18 17:34:57 For the hair its mainly shea but I switch it with coconut or castor oil.

2775 2018-03-18 17:32:53 I use it on my face but today I decided to switch the coconut oil fot the argan oil. 
2776 2018-03-18 17:32:45 On top of that they haven't done anything about their use of Palm oil which is destroying rainforest, endangered species habitats & use slave labor (palm oil plantation owners often holding onto passports of employees so they can't leave)
2777 2018-03-18 17:32:38 In the case of the obvious reference, you go after the money. Shale gas collapsing the price of oil did massive damage. Keep certain countries onside, keep oil/gas low, nail the oligarch cash, but be ready for an irrational response.

2780 2018-03-18 17:32:13 Maybe when Trump talked about “draining the swap” he was thinking about draining the Everglades, you know, to open it up for more oil drillers?!?

2782 2018-03-18 17:31:56 Thank you for your service. And what exactly was the sacrifice for? Freedom? Oil? Politics? Carlyle Group? Northrop?
2783 2018-03-18 17:31:55 Wow! That's impressive Jon. Well Done! Roastie potato's are like THEE best bit. Ours are cooking away nicely as we tweet #SozLike. However.

2798 2018-03-18 17:29:52 funny that's nothing compared to Saudi Arabia. They considered halting IPO of their oil company in case they get sued by 9-11 survivors lol
2799 2018-03-18 17:29:48 Makes me so happy seeing this! Everyone is loving the Aura oil and EX paste and it makes me the happiest chick ever
2800 2018-03-18 17:29:31 Well, I can't argue some of your analysis as I always respect the ability of the threat of war to lift oil prices even amid evidence that it hasn't (yet) limited global supply.
2801 2018-03-18 17:29:30 It’s obviously subjective but for me ghee>olive oil for eggs.

2838 2018-03-18 17:24:31 The military is actually responsible for our country not using its oil wealth to turn this place into El Dorado. They oversaw a period of lower population, when the money could have gone round. Instead, they and their civilian collaborators kept most of it for themselves.

2857 2018-03-18 17:22:25 It is plausible that, even with a cut, Iran could recoup any volume sales loss in realized net margin increase, due to higher global price on oil.  “imperious immediacy of interest.”

2926 2018-03-18 17:12:42 That bar chart exposes the question as why is it half the price to extract Norwegian oil or US when there economic model tells us cost to do anything cost more. That pie chart tells me something’s wrong and my guess it dodge money being stolen like it’s always been from Scots.

2929 2018-03-18 17:12:08 Great shave. Razor is well balanced and comfortable to use. Shave oil has a lovely scent and helps the blade glide without clogging and rinses off well.
Will highly recommend and buy from you again

2931 2018-03-18 17:11:46 I was just figuring that if Iran's choice of customers is limited it might put pressure on the price Iran can ask for the oil. Later there will be the question of geopolitical risk after Iran, Saudi Arabia & other regional players start developing nuclear weapons.

2951 2018-03-18 17:09:33 Your pie chart is shite. Consecutive estimates predict between 17 billion to a top end of 40 billion barrels still extractable in the North Sea. NS is 60% of all euro oil reserves so even being generous 1% equates to 2.5 trillion barrels left world wide - SHITE.
2952 2018-03-18 17:09:26 Bakayoko's confidence is so low, he would soon discover oil. #LEICHE

2954 2018-03-18 17:09:18 Let me know what takes eye make-up off quicker than coconut oil and then ill stop putting it on my face.
2955 2018-03-18 17:09:15 Fry bacon in olive oil in the pan before, remove bacon, scramble eggs in the 'dirty oil'  sooooooooooooo much better
2956 2018-03-18 17:09:14 Hopefully I will find oil 
2957 2018-03-18 17:09:13 Well I mean maybe a hex can prevent us from going into a peak oil mad max hellscape
2958 2018-03-18 17:09:09 Tech innovation could very well save this small micro economy in Lafayette. Instead of hedging everything on oil, which WILL be gone soon, rolling out a strong push for tech would surely help.
2959 2018-03-18 17:09:09 I tried Trader Joe's Shea Butter and Coconut Oil hair mask last night. It smells good. I let it sit in my hair overnight, and I'm gonna wash it out later
2960 2018-03-18 17:09:03 You don't want to take an Omega 3-6-9 supplement b/c having too much of Omega 6 is not good You can get Omega 9 just by having olive oil What you want more of is Omega 3
2961 2018-03-18 17:08:55 Again, tell me where an advisory committee to discuss oil and gas must include only members that want more oil and gas usage?
2962 2018-03-18 17:08:46 That is  wrong.Just remember the prayers of Nabii Ibrahim when he building Kaaba with his son Ismail which was accepted by Allah 4 Mecca to be centre of trade in the world.Bfore Oil there were prosperous neighbours eg Yemen & Aden was an old Dubai.
2963 2018-03-18 17:08:39 PODRIDO de las mentiras en 2005 empezaron con la POLÍTICA del gas oil igual a la nafta!cambié mi camioneta diesel x una nafta en el 2010 x q además casi no entraban más gasoleras;HABLO DE LABURO FURGÓN HYUNDAI H1 NO 4X4!Que pasó;Ahora vuelven a hacer diferencia como antes!!!
2964 2018-03-18 17:08:24 Like I said before when you spammed me, the vicious British military aren't heroic at all. They are used to steal oil and invade nations to achieve geopolitical control.

2968 2018-03-18 17:08:03 It is good for the skin. Some primers are moisturizers, have a high SPF content, some can be used for oil control, and they also help with making your foundation last long
2969 2018-03-18 17:08:03 youtube just helped me change my own oil i literally can’t imagine the world without the internet
2970 2018-03-18 17:08:00 The first ever Global Recycling Day will highlight the need to conserve water, air, coal, oil, natural gas and minerals and celebrate the power of the newly termed “seventh resource,” the goods we recycle every day.
2971 2018-03-18 17:07:48 Depends on how US structures sanctions.  Won't impact China, directly, but could worsen relations (or can it?).

2972 2018-03-18 17:07:41 my dad filled up my tank with gas, checked the oil, and took my car through the car wash for me before i left for school today. truly the little things that make you realize how lucky you are

2996 2018-03-18 17:05:21 Traditionally, oil companies have tended to take pro-Arab positions on the Middle East.  In that regard, Rex Tillerson was far from unusual, being a former CEO of one of the major oil companies in America.
2997 2018-03-18 17:05:18 DG brand is actual butter. Everything else in my circle is "oil spread"
2998 2018-03-18 17:05:18 even a moderately good olive oil will make nice eggs, I think. but yes, the better the olive oil, the...better.
2999 2018-03-18 17:05:05 Don't put olive oil in a box, bro
3000 2018-03-18 17:05:02 I can already feel I need some oil.
3001 2018-03-18 17:04:52 I would much prefer we buy cheaper oil from AB than ship it up the coast from the US at a much higher price. Less tanker traffic and cheaper fuel + supporting Cdn products. #bcpoli
3002 2018-03-18 17:04:46 Listen to your old commie grandma. CBD oil will help. I'll ask my friend with fibro what type and dose if you're interested.
3003 2018-03-18 17:04:38 Lol, what's the price of oil dripping from our head?
3004 2018-03-18 17:04:29 With #Assad gone #UK #US #Israel will have power over #Syria's oil & take trade away from #Russia. They can't stand it being a Super Power.
3005 2018-03-18 17:04:25 I have a new goal, Desalination Plants. Within the coming decades, water will be what oil has been for the past 100 years.

Owning Desalination Plants will be like owning Oil Refineries. They’ll be with 100s of Billions.

3016 2018-03-18 17:03:40 The US is formally allied with Saudi Arabia. One more reason in the Pros of Green Energy column. As soon as the US kicks its Saudi oil addiction, Saudi Arabia will lose its unassailable status on the international stage. They're an insult to human dignity

3023 2018-03-18 17:02:41 VAT is on revenue, not on gross profits. Indian oil companies were bleeding and inflation was in double digits. 

Retail inflation was way higher so the food items claim is wrong.

3029 2018-03-18 17:02:13 What a tremendous waste of creamed asparagus soup with truffle oil that would be, I'd never be able to live it down!
3030 2018-03-18 17:02:11 Pls sell these refineries to people melting aluminium and iron and stop wastages ,use whatever you get to build even one modern one and save us this shame as a nation. The only crude oil producing nation importing PMS ,
3031 2018-03-18 17:02:09 Ive heard of them. It just replaces the oil with healthy fats, you can’t taste it!
3032 2018-03-18 17:02:09 ISIS has been terminated but still YPG controls these lands and USA has more than 20 military base at YPG areas. And these areas are  mostly oil lands. ISIS is a temporary toy for USA to reach real aim. Now USA controls importanta lands at Syria with YPG.
3033 2018-03-18 17:01:53 I thought the same thing until last year but actually, tea tree oil is recommended by most to all vets for cats and dogs on their hotspots! It keeps your fur baby from wanting to further lick it and helps the healing process as well! Just don’t put use it for an open cut!

3047 2018-03-18 17:00:58 it's how libyans make scrambled eggs. and yes, delicious. dice a few tomato chunks into the frying oil for a bit before adding the eggs.

3098 2018-03-18 16:53:48 A nation that can print its own currency for oil cannot have an EM Balance of Payments crisis.  Up until next week, only nation that could do that was US.  China joins those ranks next week w oil contract.  Huge implications

3113 2018-03-18 16:51:37 'U.S. oil refineries that are unable to sell a dirty fuel waste product at home are exporting vast quantities of it to India instead.'  I wonder where they are getting that stuff?
3114 2018-03-18 16:51:26 - Nigerian politicians are not ready to drop their evil ways. 
- No one is ready to be a hero.

3117 2018-03-18 16:51:06 Big Oil is happy to shit on our oceans as long as their CEOs take home huge bonuses. They don't want regulation because they are not trustworthy. They have proven that many times over. Trump supports them because he is just as greedy.
3118 2018-03-18 16:51:02 Not to mention the oil derived shoes, coats, cell phones, sun glasses, signs, and other gack that they carry to these events. They just don't think things through. Short sighted and not that smart.

3120 2018-03-18 16:50:43 There is nothing we need from other countries that we can't produce ourselves. Now, thanks to Pres Trump we're even oil-independent, and we're exporting oil to other countries.
3121 2018-03-18 16:50:36 Or that Trump has not drain the swamp and actually brought into CEOs of the largest banks and oil companies and has done nothing to change the campaign Finance laws or lobbying that has gotten Washington to care more about donors then voters. It's okay he fooled about half of you

3133 2018-03-18 16:48:22 Putin's threat to cut off oil and gas sounds like a great deal to me. We learn to stop depending on fossilised technology and he learns how to prop up a failed state without the money we send him to buy those fossils.

3139 2018-03-18 16:47:08 Saudi Arabia but its power is fading.  Fracking is taking away its ability to dominate oil markets and Iran is much stronger militarily. Without the US protecting Saudi Arabia Iran would be stronger.

3155 2018-03-18 16:45:23 Single best way to undermine Putin's robber capitalist nationalism is to stop buying his oil and gas by investing as much as possible in alternative energy and modern technology. His fossilised ideas end with our dependence on fossils.

3173 2018-03-18 16:43:45 small inflation on money is a good incentive for spending. Bitcoin has no inflation and people are stacking up with no incentive to spend. Inflation is like oil for the economy, it keeps the engine going.

3212 2018-03-18 16:40:37 I hate using oil to make popcorn but air popping them isn't an option because I'm terrified of using tin foil for anything other than wrapping stuff
3213 2018-03-18 16:40:34 My tea tree face mask and coconut oil hair treatment was supposed to be only 15 minutes. Two hours later, I'm still submerged, can we say pruney fingers!  
3214 2018-03-18 16:40:32 Coconut oil + sugar is apparently an amazing exfoliating combination.

3238 2018-03-18 16:37:17 Mentions once again the ANOINTMENT of the Holy oil. Anointment is internal BTW. Jesus commanded his disciples to give the Holy oil to the sick. Christ-"The anointed one." If you're waiting for the 2nd coming of Christ you're waiting for YOURSELF to become anointed.

3240 2018-03-18 16:37:05 @IndianOilcl @karnataka_ioc i specifically went to indian oil pump at Kengiri/Srinivas Auto Service to fill up diesel so i could get points with the new petro card u had boasted about. All fumbled with the card using it as a credit/debit card,said its not working. What a waste.
3241 2018-03-18 16:37:01 Still plenty oil left. Might get some real kickback vibes going . Fuck that party shit

3247 2018-03-18 16:36:47 Yup, it's sabotage.  Schmoozed all over steel, for good photo ops, but has been bought and/or duped  to shut up on energy; LNG, oil.  Foolish. In the process, he's made a trainwreck out of thousands of jobs, and national economy, minus its revenues.
3248 2018-03-18 16:36:43 I hope my heart is also strong! It's terrifying. I have been using CBD oil from Holland and Barrett which has helped a lot, but now I'm anxious that it will make the dog indicate on me!

3253 2018-03-18 16:36:18 Makes sense  I suppose. Even if taxes go up they are still probably lower than where they left.

3257 2018-03-18 16:35:42 Why push this pipeline? Send solid bitumen and use pipeline $$ to expand rail network so when @GeneralFusion makes oil obsolete in <20 years we don't have to pay to clean up a pipeline that ran for ten years and went bankrupt. K-M pipeline is worst method for jobs and revenue.

3295 2018-03-18 16:30:46 So what will you do about the American tankers that go GASP PAST VICTORIA TO CHERRY POINT REFINERY. Are they different. As an Alberta I support cutting bc off and taxing all natural gas and oil you ship through Alta to markets.there is more to bc than Vancouver

3320 2018-03-18 16:28:25 Because realistically we should he trying to get out of the business of oil production before that refinery would pay for itself.
3321 2018-03-18 16:28:23 It actually shows acres upon acres of  Tar sands they sift the used filth oil to reuse leaving  uninhabitable lands.

3322 2018-03-18 16:28:03 This "let's put coconut oil in EVERYTHING!!!!" trend needs to die... Like right now. Y'know, because of anaphylaxic shock since I am allergic. Kthanksbye.
3323 2018-03-18 16:28:03 Wouldn't the ones fleeing be leaving because they don't like high taxes and low growth?
3324 2018-03-18 16:28:00 I just blocked her. I have seen this before where someone starts being divisive. If you guys have not had any problems that's good enough for me tbh, especially as I've known and followed some here for quite some time, like Dave.

3337 2018-03-18 16:26:21 Morocco imports oil does not export oil. To have a pipeline usually there is something to put in it.

3339 2018-03-18 16:26:16 Though Modi has done some fiscal responsibility act it’s more because of import bill going down due to reduction in oil prices.

3346 2018-03-18 16:25:31 At the risk of diminishing the thought behind the picture, there is a heck of a lot of oil on the apron. That could be telling a story too.

3350 2018-03-16 23:59:59 So you prefer a 226-year old amendment over sensible gun reform? Do you wait 226 years to change the oil in your car? Check the foundation of your house? Visit your doctor for a check up?
3351 2018-03-16 23:59:46  yeah and if you put oil in them
3352 2018-03-16 23:59:38 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil
3353 2018-03-16 23:59:28 And not the good light oil either. Fracked right out of his gassy ass. Some body light a match and flare him to the moon.

3357 2018-03-16 23:58:29 A synthetic process that requires specialized equipment is not how the geologic processes of the Earth work to produce oil. It did take millions of years for fossil fuels to form NATURALLY. Nothing supernatural about it.

3394 2018-03-16 23:57:07 i changed the oil in my car by myself none of u say anything i am the man idc if u been known how. i am jesus 2 u now.
3395 2018-03-16 23:56:59 My solution to everything- tea tree oil 
3396 2018-03-16 23:56:58 Exactly why and what are doing in Iraq when supposibly we pulled out years ago. Oil field protection maybe?
3397 2018-03-16 23:56:57 Most carbon based products Oil included could be environmentally neutral if only they were used efficiently and sustainably- Hint: stop fricken burning it and throwing it away mid cycle
3398 2018-03-16 23:56:41 You’re not coconut oil. You cannot heal these ashy mfs. They are ashy today and will be ashy tomorrow. Go to sleep 
3399 2018-03-16 23:56:39 I am guessing she will be released with no charges and will end up back protesting tomorrow. Never any consequences these days for breaking the law. 
Oil Companies should sue them personally for loss of revenue for disruptions.
3400 2018-03-16 23:56:36 Who’s ready for singles week  plenty of oil  #FiveStarHotel @E4Tweets
3401 2018-03-16 23:56:32 You seem to think that I am against oil sands. I am not. I am simply against the stupidity of doing nothing, because it is hard. There is more energy sources avail than wind and solar. Geo thermal, is a huge benefit, we can utilize our garbage dumps for electricity.

 fucking gross babe @axcelross09
3405 2018-03-16 23:56:06 It was already underway, pipelines are the safest oil and gas transport method!
3406 2018-03-16 23:55:59 Rex didn’t accept the job because he wanted to serve the country, he accepted the job for 1 reason and that’s OIL! Rex wanted trump to lift the sanctions, but trump couldn’t do it fast enough so he quit! But they made it look like trump fired him.... he gave 2 weeks notice bro!
3407 2018-03-16 23:55:50 People who go to motive and expect you to drop them home without even discussing it with you.... I’m sorry but are you paying for my petrol. Last I checked the car ran on oil not kindness or friendship.

3409 2018-03-16 23:55:40 Omg this man is stupid and greedy. He is in the pocket of big oil and expects that we are all to stupid to see what he is up to!
3410 2018-03-16 23:55:28 How much do make from the oil industry?
3411 2018-03-16 23:55:26 Um, oil prices crashed.  How do you figure this wouldn't affect jobs?  Good thing Notley was there to keep our economy as stable as possible by not instituting austerity measures that would have made it worse and thrown thousands more to the street. Thankfully you weren't premier
3412 2018-03-16 23:55:24 yep.
3413 2018-03-16 23:55:20 Get off internet.  We did it for decades.
3414 2018-03-16 23:55:15 It is truly depressing how becoming a petro-state totally erodes political leaders' ethics and integrity. Oil is a political drug, and the users, people like @RachelNotley, @JustinTrudeau, and @cathmckenna begin to act just like crack addicts.
3415 2018-03-16 23:54:59 Going tomorrow right after my oil change 
3416 2018-03-16 23:54:49 Trump has no choice but to fire Mueller because,Trump the snake oil salesman, knows he will be exposed and all of his criminal activities will be public.  When he fires Mueller and if GOP still does nothing, it's up to the people, otherwise we are step closer to North Korea
3417 2018-03-16 23:54:47 Nor could we have healthcare, child care, or any other social programs associated with taxes or govt spending. The hipocrasy of "David Suzuki Environmentalist" who drive to oil sand protests and parade around with signs made from lumber, cardboard, and paper is astonishing.
3418 2018-03-16 23:54:45 Heard him mentioning oil  Ceec is inlove
3419 2018-03-16 23:54:43 OHL (oil)
3420 2018-03-16 23:54:38 Sir alvin ask ko lang po. Ano po ang status ng oil products? Rollback or increase?

3423 2018-03-16 23:54:15 Good to know about the vitamins. But do you just apply the coconut oil to your skin? I have had KP since middle school.
3424 2018-03-16 23:53:53 Dark skin women are unrepresented highly in everything y’all only tolerate us when we have oil dripping off our ass. So yes , I have no problem with Black Panther not having light skins. Next.
3425 2018-03-16 23:53:46 Oil cleanse all the way. My face doesn’t feel 100% clean if I just use my gel cleanser, but I only oil cleanse when I wear makeup. 
3426 2018-03-16 23:53:31 They may be able to get a job on all them oil rigs too. I heard the oil industry is looking for 100s of thousands of people
3427 2018-03-16 23:53:19 Well isn't that sweet. Washington will generously supply Vancouver with oil and fuel and host B.C's lower mainland shoppers in Washington state for gas, groceries and whatever else to avoid the the exorbitant cost and taxes.
3428 2018-03-16 23:52:53 So talking about #SonicManiaPlus: does anyone think the team went back and reworked Oil Ocean’s boss?
3429 2018-03-16 23:52:51 Syria is a net importer of oil, so this is a facile but bullshit answer.
3430 2018-03-16 23:52:37 Just did a hot oil treatment and deep condtion in my hair my head feels 10 times lighter
3431 2018-03-16 23:51:38 Did he really do it as an "act of service?" Or was he going to ease sanctions on Russia so all those oil fields locked down could be freed up to make billions for Exxon?

Just wondering.
3432 2018-03-16 23:51:37 To cool the burning I used Aloe Vera and my primary care ended up putting me on birth control bc my acne was hormonal and that helped a little but I also use for a cleanser Bare Minerals oil cleanser it’s not super drying and for pimples I use OXY spot treatment
3433 2018-03-16 23:51:24 My Oil diffuser stay on lol
3434 2018-03-16 23:51:22 Oil futures settle higher to notch a second straight weekly rise
3435 2018-03-16 23:51:14 Things look rosy and prosperous in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States only because the West wishes it. When the world finally loses its dependence on oil, they will finally tire of the princes and all these pretty concrete and glass structures will come crashing down
3436 2018-03-16 23:51:06 I have never been one to say we should shut down the oil sands. To me it is asinine, it is needed for everything that we build. Can't have bikes, tires, windmills, solar, batteries, clothes, houses, paper, or food without some sort of oil sands contributions.
3437 2018-03-16 23:51:00 But it looks like a lovely oil painting in the photograph? #ArtOfTheDay
3438 2018-03-16 23:50:57 If simply go back to oil and call it a mistake! Maybe tell his associates 45 truly is nuts... in case anyone still doubts the veracity of this assertion!
3439 2018-03-16 23:50:45 @Eaze_Team   How much oil/concentrate is there in the Dom all-in-one pens?  Thanks!
3440 2018-03-16 23:50:40 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that there was a belief that the Falkands sat on a huge amount of oil.
3441 2018-03-16 23:50:29 You have to treat them a few times.  Olive oil 3 to 4 hours in an enclosure in heat then take them out rinse them off let them soak in water Then do it again in a week
3442 2018-03-16 23:50:19 VO5 hot oil mixed with warm tears

3450 2018-03-16 23:48:51 Another brow tip: No brow gel? Use a clear hair gel infused with castor oil to set your brows, it’ll help with hair growth
3451 2018-03-16 23:48:50 Absent the Trans Mountain Washington will see more oil trains full of explosive Bakken Crude rolling through the built up areas of Washington. That is simply a fact
3452 2018-03-16 23:48:43 I have never thought that it is a one size fits all approach. The coast could use wave, Sun, and wind. The interior could use wind and solar with a top up from geothermal. East coast would be similar to west coast. Calling oil sand dirty though is also a bit cheap IMO.
3453 2018-03-16 23:48:39 Came to get an oil change now I need new front tires lol why y'all not minding yours tho but imma take care of that too now thank you

3478 2018-03-16 23:45:46 It's Muslim oil, probably the biggest transfer of wealth from Canada to Muslim countries in Canadian history, over the last 2 years.

3496 2018-03-16 23:44:13 Wondering why oil is being "kept" (aka manipulated) over 60, especially after European close and on Fridays. I could have understood if the Aramco IPO was around the corner but that ain't happening either. What could the driver be here?
3497 2018-03-16 23:44:13 My ass always traveling in clusters and then I wonder why I need a oil change every 5 mins
3498 2018-03-16 23:44:11 I think both
3499 2018-03-16 23:43:46 This morning when I was getting my oil changed, a woman burped loudly, looked at me and asked if I taught at the school on my sweatshirt then asked if they had a good forensic psychology program.

3502 2018-03-16 23:43:32 It was not public service. It was to gut State Department and get sanctions removed for mega billion oil deal.

3507 2018-03-16 23:43:21 Canada should ask China to help out the Rohingyas. After all the PLA(N) has plans (excuse the pun) for the Bay of Bengal, including a oil/gas terminal and a naval base at #kyaukphyu where the Rohingyas used to live.
3508 2018-03-16 23:42:38 The moral compass is pointing directly at palm oil being the problem. Have a look through your cupboards... take your moral compass... it won't know where to point first.

3510 2018-03-16 23:42:15 That oil ain't no joke
3511 2018-03-16 23:41:59 I suspect Rex is only thinking about how he failed to secure the .05% back hand payment to the Trump Crime Family for the Rosneft Oil Deal - the only reason he was hired.
3512 2018-03-16 23:41:58 This cream is BOMB but for my combo skin I found out that it works best (for my skin) under a moisturizer. I used it for months without one and my skin began to over produce oil like crazy because I wasn’t moisturizing.
3513 2018-03-16 23:41:57 We could all stop relying on oil as well as keep trying to get this war stopped.

3523 2018-03-16 23:40:41 What oil are you beefing about? From Iraq? Did 1 drop of it reach UK or USA? France & Germany bought most of the oil from Iraq What they couldn’t buy was sold by ISIS to Turkey & Syria If you knew world oil markets, you would have learnt that at least
3524 2018-03-16 23:40:38 It’s getting harder and harder to get oil out of the ground, so we have had to get more drilling rigs and send them out to drill wells

3534 2018-03-16 23:40:11 Moisturizing , protective styles, and wrap your hair or wear a bonnet at night. Satin pillow covers too. And don’t wear it out all the time that’s how you get breakage. Cantu for leave in for natural hair is super good paired with olive oil and water

That's how good my parents have it
3537 2018-03-16 23:39:47 I bet they used oil to take their fight there.
3538 2018-03-16 23:39:42 If you want to naturally exfoliate, I recommend using coffee and honey or coffee and avocado oil twice a week. My skin always feel amazing afterwards and my dry patches are pretty much nonexistent!

3541 2018-03-16 23:39:30 Ask them if they would have preferred a pipeline over a train loaded with oil? There is no safer way to move oil than pipelines. Though I'd bet modern tankers are a close second. Life is full of risks, always will be. Smart people choose the least risky for the desired outcome.

3548 2018-03-16 23:37:50 I bet Coconut oil will do the job fine. We used to comb our daughters scalp (gently obv) to get that stuff out. It helped a ton. Hope this helps lol
3549 2018-03-16 23:37:39 How about sweet almond oil?

3605 2018-03-16 23:29:27 She is right! The US and Turkey apparently made the deal: Turkey takes all west of Euphrates and US gets to control the east of Euphrates where the major oil and gas fields are. Ultimate fault, however, is with Kurds, who betrayed their country Syria & allied themselves with US.

3613 2018-03-16 23:28:01 Why are pipelines more important now that oil is worth half as much as it was 10 years ago? Why couldn't all of those conservative governments at so many levels get these pipelines built? What makes them think they could do it now?

3621 2018-03-16 23:27:02 I have a more radical view. The US shall withdraw the JCPOA and press to sack the I.R from UN. It should put full embargo on oil sell. A regime which openly sponsors terrorism must not be admitted as a Nation in the UN. Look how Britain is treating Russia post the London murders.
3622 2018-03-16 23:27:00 Thanks! I've actually tried tamanu oil but it didn't really do anything for me. Like everything, skincare is 100% YMMV (I also have a routine that works I just haven't followed it since I've alternated between being stressed and sick the past few weeks)

3638 2018-03-16 23:24:15 You should try organic Tamanu Oil. It work pretty well for me.
3639 2018-03-16 23:24:11 The Jobs left when oil prices dropped and these so called world class industries set sail. That's what Pierre Trudeau was trying to STOP with the National Energy Program! Canada does NOT bomb other countries for NO reason. Harper commited crimes against humanity!
3640 2018-03-16 23:23:17 Democracy Now with Amy Goodman is also an excellent show since Amy brings news from all over the world including from Israel. She also covers the Afrkan Americnas that are suffering due to oil pollution in the USA. #news #truth
3641 2018-03-16 23:23:11 Need an oil change like...2 weeks ago.
3642 2018-03-16 23:23:09 Oil change with a free car wash and vacuum ! #yesssssirrrrrr !!
3643 2018-03-16 23:23:05 Vayan los empleados del Grupo I.,.oil, etc a conversar con el "secuestrado" ahora en libertad, para qué con la derivada ($) ponga las cuentas en orden y les devuelva el trabajo. Sería justo. Inviable....es Argentina. Todo se olvida.
3644 2018-03-16 23:22:59 Your like the Dennis Miller of oil men
3645 2018-03-16 23:22:37 That would make a great oil painting
3646 2018-03-16 23:22:35 When you make your stir fry with too much cocoanut oil 

And you don’t like cocoanut oil that much 


3647 2018-03-16 23:22:22 I never saw Tillerson's motivations as an act of public service.  I thought he was there to ensure the sanctions were lifted so the $500 billion Exxon deal for Russian oil could go forward.  Didn't work out that way.  Now he leave a couple weeks after Exxon pulls out of the deal.
3648 2018-03-16 23:22:22 If USA stops taking democracy and peace to Syria,  it will stop.
Oil found in Somalia ,  wait and see; USA will immy try to take democracy to there.
3649 2018-03-16 23:22:21 The eggs are in the packaging & often in produce like rice, flour, cereal etc. If you put the products in the freezer for a few days before you put them in the cupboard it will eliminate them. Try wiping cupboard surfaces with eucalyptus oil to get rid of those already there.
3650 2018-03-16 23:22:21 What makes most sense to crooked @SecretaryZinke is maximizing profit for the oil, gas, and coal industry.
3651 2018-03-16 23:21:54 Are you referencing a certain youtuber?......
3652 2018-03-16 23:21:38 Though recent visit of Saudi Crown Prince was somewhat overshadowed by incidents in Salisbury, Al-Yamamah was effectively continued with order of 48 Typhoons from BAE. 

Perhaps Boris can give us some insight into where missing £billions have gone from the oil for arms slush fund
3653 2018-03-16 23:21:36 "Rex Tillerson Was" all set to close a $1/2 trillion oil deal with Russia until the US Congress shut it down by not lifting sanctions. He subsequently gutted his own State Department & refused to spend appropriated funds to fight Russian influence.
Enjoy your medal of friendship
3654 2018-03-16 23:21:15 Toss it in a olive oil sprinkle with salt, place on a baking tray on gas mark 6 for 10 to 20 mins

3657 2018-03-16 23:20:39 There is no oil. What little there is is worthless. If Scotland isn’t in the EU no one will extract it. Did I get that last bit wrong?
3658 2018-03-16 23:20:34 Oil heat??

3677 2018-03-16 23:17:33 Don't comb it, spritz with water, oil & leave in conditioner every day. Shea moisture (I know, they're cancelled) leave in conditioner.
3678 2018-03-16 23:17:32 @elonmusk for everything there is a custom I speak from my grim life, in my substandard abode. Entire nations of families put food on the table through the old industry(oil industry). I propose "Tesla Student Grants" to help former oil industry workers/tradesman thrive.
3679 2018-03-16 23:17:26 His dad's FBI right?  I was on the fence but now I'm concerned about the FBI.  Very concerned.
3680 2018-03-16 23:17:09 dont drive too long on 3 cylinders, the one not firing is filling the cylinder and eventually your oil pan with fuel
3681 2018-03-16 23:17:02 All the rhetoric about keeping oil in the ground is not for the environment, but for later retrieval.

Like Venezuela, the economy can suffer, it's only collateral damage that this govt doesn't have to bear.

Mandated by foriegn interests.

#Ableg #abpoli #ClimateChange is fake.
3682 2018-03-16 23:16:59 $100 over limit, count child support as 2/3 income. I’ve argued shelter, food, clothing. Doesn’t even cover half of the housing payment, forget oil (up to $2,000 this winter at 68 degrees in house). State doesn’t care. She’s 18, senior, then college, so until then, nope.
3683 2018-03-16 23:16:52 The shapeshifting lizard people can time travel too, actually!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3684 2018-03-16 23:16:47 Did you see them? An oil rig.
3685 2018-03-16 23:16:45 It's always true that "eventually Oil will always rise up to the water surface", even if the MSM conveniently misses reporting  the Dems corrupt practices..
3686 2018-03-16 23:16:29 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3687 2018-03-16 23:16:03 whoever puts clove oil in the same containers as poppers should be ashamed of themselves
3688 2018-03-16 23:15:40 This kid is getting rode hard and put up wet and doesn't even know it. 
When the left is done psychologically molesting him for their enjoyment, he'll be kicked to the curb.
3689 2018-03-16 23:15:30 He was only hired to get the oil out of Russia that Eexon has just sitting there!! To bad those pesky sanctions are getting in the way!
3690 2018-03-16 23:15:17 I meant that as a reply to your tweet. “Also to his father who failed him.”

3696 2018-03-16 23:14:54 Many people don't have symptoms until it's too late. People as young as 19 are getting diagnosed. I was 38. Other women I've met just turned 30. Cancer is an epidemic. Those chemo chairs are at capacity. Start shipping cannabis oil & see how fast patients heal.
3697 2018-03-16 23:14:46 Do you have an oil diffuser at home?

3703 2018-03-16 23:14:09 Oh absolutely. I had a rough towel w/ mineral oil run over it. it worked well to soften the feel of it. I'm still covered in little fibers. Is that all it needs? Because Some people do more which is where fire gets brought into the picture. .-.
3704 2018-03-16 23:14:07 what kind of castor oil do you use?
3705 2018-03-16 23:14:06 The irony is, he was the ceo of one of the most powerful oil companies systemically involved in covering up environmental catastrophes. This is what he really should be remembered for.
3706 2018-03-16 23:14:00 try it!! also i been using vitamin e oil and rose hip oil to moisturize instead of an actual moisturizer so that’s been improving my skin a lot.. and combing my eyebrows up w eyebrow gel before i conceal them and fill them in is also something ive been doing!!

3723 2018-03-16 23:11:39 Israel/Palestine requires neutralising Iran. So does building oil/gas pipelines and exploiting central Asia resources. Preventing terrorism in the West requires neutralising Iran. Afghanistan too, although Pakistan is a bigger player there. America can't afford these endless wars

3737 2018-03-16 23:10:11 I’ve made two oil change appointments in the past week and cancelled them both because that’s how much I hate getting an oil change.

3740 2018-03-16 23:10:03 Maybe they will supply tanker delivered Alaskan oil to BC. Pay the US to supply their oil.
3741 2018-03-16 23:10:00 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
3742 2018-03-16 23:09:56 my favorite thing about using my bread machine to knead bread is the big black oil streaks it puts in the dough.

3745 2018-03-16 23:09:40 Haha yea that foundation is dry af but try using a hydrating primer or even the oil primers the ones that have little droppers those work good for keeping my skin hydrated too
3746 2018-03-16 23:09:26 I'll add neem oil to that list. It worked for me.
3747 2018-03-16 23:09:14 Not exactly. I just cooked some chicken and put corn oil on one side and it tastes good though. Easier to clean up as well
3748 2018-03-16 23:08:23 IT reminds me of the old 70s lava lights. Think it's to do with density. The salt is heavier than the water but takes the oil with it then releases it again

3753 2018-03-16 23:07:46 Go to make poached fish in parchment but we’re out of white wine.

Close up parchment. 

DH: “You put the wine in there right?”

“Argh!”

3773 2018-03-16 23:05:34 How is it national interest to build a pipeline to ship unrefined oil to China then when the product could be refined, taxed several times over and used here to pay for green energy projects domestically?

3775 2018-03-16 23:05:16 It says its sustainable in the picture above, and non deforestation palm oil, as mentioned in Greenpeace article, is exactly that, sustainable. I know a thing or two about Greenpeace, and they don't let producers off the hook unless they are sure.

3783 2018-03-16 23:04:02 I'm against oil because I'm pro-earth
3784 2018-03-16 23:03:57 Coconut oil, planners, mailing supplies and decorations on holidays. Even learning flash cards for kids.
3785 2018-03-16 23:03:14 Wichita May have lost but I changed my oil filter for the first time myself so there’s that #adult
3786 2018-03-16 23:03:04 A phonetic spelling of how you say “oil” 
3787 2018-03-16 23:02:58 Very little prep! Kosher salt and black pepper, and pour a little olive oil on each side.  Run it in.  Let the steak get to almost room temp before putting on the grill.
3788 2018-03-16 23:02:56 drenched in olive oil and vinegar

3792 2018-03-16 23:02:03 What "value" have you and the NDP actually added to the Alberta resource sector? No doubt such value would be accurately reflected in the current price we get for our oil.
3793 2018-03-16 23:01:56 Also, i've moved 51 miles in 4 days.

Next step: chugging olive oil.

Although I did eat a pound of reeses cups by myself last night.

3799 2018-03-16 23:01:34 Well ain’t that a fine how do you do!
I got a weed oil cartridge today with a very high amount of THC in it because my stomach was so upset.  I underestimated the strength and now I’m fucked up rn.

3801 2018-03-16 23:00:56 Guy picks up RV at noon tomorrow, take the rest of my crap to storage unit, get oil changed in my car, get dog food, & maybe get my hair cut. Hopefully be on the road Sunday morning headed to Myrtle Beach, then Senoia, GA, to Nic & Norman’s restaurant on our voyage to NM.
3802 2018-03-16 23:00:51 えっローソン行ってくるわ
3803 2018-03-16 23:00:38 Of course he did. The more oil leaving Canada from our own coast the less money his state makes. 
If you think this was an altruistic move, you’re not looking hard enough. He’s a politician.
3804 2018-03-16 23:00:29 I don't see any of these princesses on oil platforms, slinging garbage cans or running a pig down a nat gas pipeline.

Why is it inclusive only to women? Where's muh diversity? 

Is it because you have an agenda?
3805 2018-03-16 23:00:20 why not start selling "garlic cloves in oil"
3806 2018-03-16 23:00:15 My mom drove my car to work yesterday while hers got an oil change and hearing her complain about how shitty it is is HILARIOUS to me.

3812 2018-03-16 22:59:36 Thanks for speaking for the rest of us Mike. We women just LOVE it when you do that!
3813 2018-03-16 22:59:33 How would suggest using it. I have a serum where the first ingredient is Ozonated olive oil then squalene. That doesn't sound like a serum to me 
3814 2018-03-16 22:59:29 Ah at least there's that. Use the oil daily. 4-6 drops should suffice. And if you can, brush it a bit before applying the oil.
3815 2018-03-16 22:59:25 Only reason we moved was because of oil. I do not like being in Satan’s armpit.
3816 2018-03-16 22:59:22 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
3817 2018-03-16 22:59:22 A lot of dispensaries will sell cbd only chocolate or gummies. It's a cheaper way to find out if it'll work for you before dropping money on a whole bottle of oil. You'll also find more variety if you get a med card in my experience.

3821 2018-03-16 22:58:22 Liberal News has no plans on pivoting anything! Always doing their best to create as much term oil as possible! What would really happen?If a liberal journalists had to be responsible for just one of their comments?Because they have never been! and don't really care about America
3822 2018-03-16 22:58:09 I shampoo it very rarely- ordering some beard oil now. I don't use a hair dryer, thankfully.
3823 2018-03-16 22:57:49 Today a Washington governor tried to dupe Canadians. While his city reaps huge rewards exporting oil, he attempts to stifle the same from “up north”.
Don’t be fooled. His interests are for the wealth of his constituents and fundraisers.
3824 2018-03-16 22:57:24 Listing coconut oil salt scrub tomorrow morning 
3825 2018-03-16 22:57:13 Yes but until a powerful white male says it, it is not real. And the marketisation of education is not only fees, it is also research funding competition, USS pension fund invested in arms, oil and exploitative corporations, precarious labour, low union enrollment....

3828 2018-03-16 22:56:44 Excellent Question. I did read yesterday that Putin had made a request for ex-pats from Russia to come back & "bring their money home". I have felt that since the price of oil tanked, Russia's economy has really suffered. Since 2014 Putin has spent more $, with less coming in.

3832 2018-03-16 22:55:39 Fun fact: WA is the number one mint oil producer in the nation

3836 2018-03-16 22:55:12 Tariffs on steel right now. This was a good play by PM Trudeau to go and get press coverage at steel & aluminum plants. Coverage & play in US would have been noticed by the one person who watches TV all the time. There will be another time for oil, likely sooner than later.
3837 2018-03-16 22:55:04 First he criticised the club, then he tries to lower our expectations by comparing us go a team who was founded on oil money in 2012, now he's calling the fan's idiots. The line has to be drawn here. Time to go
3838 2018-03-16 22:55:03 The legislature has corrected the CBD oil issue brought to light last year through SEA 52. I’m happy the #INLegis has taken a step in the right direction to improve health care options for Hoosiers, but legalized #medicalmarijuana is still needed.

3841 2018-03-16 22:54:45 Buy a good all natural beard oil. Bought an absolute gem from Amazon UK for around €16. It made most of beard druff disappear and >
3842 2018-03-16 22:54:44 Apparently olive oil fucks up your stomach. Two fucking tablespoons and now I can’t go to the gym

3849 2018-03-16 22:53:23 Damn! Why the peanut oil cost more than the other cooking oils?
3850 2018-03-16 22:53:20 More like 6th, the bugez is a machine and coffee is his gasoline and oil

3852 2018-03-16 22:52:49 Remember it's not the bondholders fault PREPA is dependent upon oil. It's management & the government's fault.
3853 2018-03-16 22:52:42 Viviani? Nooooo. He's funny looking for sure but then I'm no oil painting. I suspect Moscon for Sky might have a chance. Now HE is a rough diamond.
3854 2018-03-16 22:52:41 We see the same thing around here with trans Canada oil pumps. Good load but do nothing for the community's. Other customers certainly shouldn't be subsidizing these. Individual Commercial Demand rates might help some, who knows.
3855 2018-03-16 22:52:39 I'm so glad they made it into an oil... Lol
3856 2018-03-16 22:52:30 I feel this way about jujubes (literally just processed oil). The candy of the worker is peanut butter cups (dialectic taste profile).

3870 2018-03-16 22:51:15 This is some really cerebral stuff you're throwing around. You do realize our former PM's only "real job" (private sector), was a mailroom clerk for an oil company? Anonymous twitter is the brain stem of twitter: the lowest, most primitive area of the human brain.

3872 2018-03-16 22:51:03 Went with some friends to watch the Oil Kings game on Sunday. Three adults, three kids, and we all took the bus. The kids loved it, and it was fun and easy for us. On a Sunday - the worst bus day.
3873 2018-03-16 22:50:43 Sustainable is oil and gas. The UN runs the ponzi  scheme of taking over our resources so they can implement socialism and tax the middle class out of existence.  Don’t believe the narrative of the state run mainstream media in Canada.
3874 2018-03-16 22:50:37 Damn that’s hella early, hope all was well with the baby  I told myself if this oil shit didn’t work id stop trying shit & let nature take its course.. but I’m fucking mad it didn’t work lol

3876 2018-03-16 22:50:22 Well, we either need cuts or an increase in revenue. I'm of the impression most people do not want cuts to any services. If anything they want increases in funding to services.And anyone that thinks we will see oil revenue like days of old are probably going to be disappointed.
3877 2018-03-16 22:50:15 The hacks throughout our media have to provide the ill-informed public with an excuse for a full blown invasion of Syria, because Russia are eliminating our terrorist proxies & saving a sovereign nation. How dare they! There’s oil to be stolen!

3892 2018-03-16 22:48:13 Solar and wind won’t do in northern areas. Wind turbines are gas powered when there’s no wind. Steel made from coal, oil greased cogs and they kill bats and birds in the thousands. They cause cows to abort, make low frequency noise and collapse if they get a sideways gust.

3923 2018-03-16 22:43:32 Not a gas lamp. There were street lamps in New York, but they were fueled with oil until around 1825, when the conversion was made to gas.
3924 2018-03-16 22:43:18 My grandparents had a neighbor who did some pretty fantastic oil paintings of squirrels. He gave them one of 3 squirrels sitting around a campfire, roasting marshmallows. It's SPECTACULAR! Next time I go back home I'll send a pic. Or send the actual work. My gram doesn't want it.

3929 2018-03-16 22:42:56 Radios mmmm unless high quality intrusive; spa music with good sound system is heavenly and a diffuser with lavender oil

3933 2018-03-16 22:42:27 I think I put on too much rosemary oil. Will I overdose?  everything tingles.
3934 2018-03-16 22:42:10 Well not all business, just mining, oil, tobacco, media businesses.
3935 2018-03-16 22:42:10 And you better use just as much baby oil! 
3936 2018-03-16 22:42:07 tea tree oil is really my best friend rn

3938 2018-03-16 22:41:41 I find that cold compress combined with the scent from peppermint oil helps

3941 2018-03-16 22:41:28 Coat two baking potatoes in vegetable oil and salt, bake on 400 for 55 minutes and test with fork for tenderness. For toppings, use vegan butter. With cost, no other flavors really needed
3942 2018-03-16 22:41:25 I just bought the shea moisture beard oil, only to have the whole container empty in my duffle bag . Not one drop left.

3945 2018-03-16 22:41:18 Last time I was there, still nothing. It was supposed to be condos but I think the oil crash stopped that so it's just an empty lot. Such a waste
3946 2018-03-16 22:41:17 My friend developed tremors. I told him about coconut oil and sent him that video.  He ran out and got coconut oil, started cooking with it. In less than a month, his tremors were gone!
3947 2018-03-16 22:41:13 I can literally fry some eggs with the amount of oil my face produces
3948 2018-03-16 22:41:09 Undo damage then take a vacation!  In a National Monument or Park where I won't pay exorbitant fees, won't see any oil wells, pipelines or uranium mines, will be able to see free and living wildlife and can sit by clean water and breath clean air.  In other words, go back to 2016
3949 2018-03-16 22:41:04 “You’ll need to change your oil every 5,000 miles. And then get your tire rotated every other oil change... rotating your tires is moving them to different place on your vehicle so they don’t get worn down in one spot too quickly.” #Mansplaining
3950 2018-03-16 22:40:43 My favorite saying of my mom is when she talks about olive oil and says “virgin? We don’t like no virgins”

Them: Vegetable
Me: which vegetable?
Them : what? #foodallergies #problems

3959 2018-03-16 22:39:49 .@RyanZinke wants to double entry fees at our national parks at the same time proposing a cut in payments from energy companies to drill oil & gas on public lands & offshore waters which will destroy our lands & water. @realDonaldTrump is this your #TrumpMAGA #TrumpSwamp #SAD

downsides of burning ur entire hand in boiling oil: my flesh is peeling off with solidified coconut in chunky skin flakes :))
3964 2018-03-16 22:38:57 a stray drop of oil & all the precious work is undone
3965 2018-03-16 22:38:50 Later. The oil and gas lobby will get their government puppets to legislate it to death.

3969 2018-03-16 22:37:32 Even if I hadn’t personally given my keys to Billy today to take my car and change the oil I’d still know he drove it bec my seat was all the way back and the music was blasting in my car when I got in it

3976 2018-03-16 22:36:33 Coconut oil isn’t good your face either. Don’t @ me. Debate your muva.
3977 2018-03-16 22:36:26 You are pro oil and coal. Stop shrinking our national parks. Why did you spend over $130k for doors? You are a bum.

3981 2018-03-16 22:36:03 I’ll bet his answer in private is to sell off as much of the land as possible for oil and gas since national parks don’t make him any richer.
3982 2018-03-16 22:35:54 While in Victoria try some conversation with Horgy McHorganface about the sewage and oil pipelines.  
Penny for your thoughts.
3983 2018-03-16 22:35:48 Nothing will still change in Nigeria...even if d oil prices jump to $800. Politicians will make more money while the masses still remain in their state of hardship and untold living conditions to make ends meet.
Same people will come on social media to praise their oppressors
3984 2018-03-16 22:35:43 @DeliverooHelp Appalling service tonight, and your awful arrangements with @TheospizzaLDN  has led to their reputation suffering. Turned up an hour late but looks... great, for a cold pizza covered in leaked oil.
3985 2018-03-16 22:35:33 Got some $ from the bank, filled my tank w gas using a gift card from a dear friend, then windshield washer fluid, checked oil, parked under my maple tree, and the car is covered in bird poop. Forgot abt the birds. Supposed to rain and/or snow on the way 2 Columbus, will wash car
3986 2018-03-16 22:35:30 Maybe they struck oil.
3987 2018-03-16 22:35:24 Interesting, it must be the smell of all that old oil, new rubber and the sounds of lug nuts being ripped off by swearing mechanics...

3990 2018-03-16 22:34:20 Cool to see @HectorJr300 make history on the Lucas Oil Buell with the first 200 mph PSM run!
3991 2018-03-16 22:34:20 That wasnt dilbit and honestly do you even need the internet to tell you that gasoline is more flamable than any other form of heavy oil. Just use some common sense. Lac Magnetic was Bakken oil from the states being imported in to Canada to refine.
3992 2018-03-16 22:34:17 i will live vicariously through you. i ran the streets this morning at the dealership getting my oil changed. lol
3993 2018-03-16 22:34:14 I use EB butter on warm pancakes, muffins, breads...occasionally in recipes calling for butter that I’m Vegan-izing. I like olive oil and coconut oil for making most recipes though. Olive is super buttery in soups (to me) so I haven’t really missed cow’s butter.
3994 2018-03-16 22:34:05 Serving our country? How? We have no stake in the region. We get nothing from it. You didn't take the oil... oh you forgot about that?
3995 2018-03-16 22:33:57 — Gabriel was chained to the wall by a few Demons, and a ring of holy oil was lit around him. His wings instinctively pressed against his back, avoiding the heat of the flames.

Then, the torture began.

His screams were muffled by the strong stitching on his lips. He sobbed as —

4002 2018-03-16 22:32:59 man I'm hesitant to even put a grain of salt in it. I dunno about butter and coconut oil. I'm a meat and potatoes kinda coffee guy
4003 2018-03-16 22:32:53 This is simply a mis representation of facts. When the large oil companies and big business is on the same page as the govt in regards to carbon pricing, people need to realize this is the future and complaining about inevitability is a fools game. That's more my point

4008 2018-03-16 22:32:10 Things you say to your mechanic father- So like is my gas tank just going to be held on with ratchet straps forever or like? Also for the fifth time I need to know how much money parts are going to cost. You said you’d fix my brakes a month ago and I’m going to need an oil change
4009 2018-03-16 22:32:10 Being aware of trauma impact is as vital as cultural competence & other aspects of person-centered care. However,many clinicians & institutions use “trauma-informed care” as a way to spread #pseudoscience & snake oil. #mentalillness deserves evidence-based care as much as medical

4020 2018-03-16 22:30:43 I see you're not being obtuse your actually a bot of some kind. 
Majority of our imports are in fact Canadian oil sold tonthe USA refinwd there and then sold back to us un the East. Surely you now how to do a little research yourself or have YOU not been programmed to do that?
4021 2018-03-16 22:30:40 Things I learned this week: oil of oregano does NOT work to stop a cold, Tru TV is listening to our tweets (even when you don't @ them...), and I am WAY too into #MarchMadness.

4024 2018-03-16 22:30:03 I work in the oil and gas industry, so we can discuss this as a separate issue. I'm a moderate.
4025 2018-03-16 22:29:42 I’m on about day three of using @KrazyEssentials Balancing Oil. So far, my T-zone has been the more neutral it’s been in months. The skin on my cheeks that is normally dry has more of a healthy bounce & my forehead isn’t an oil pit anymore. I’ll post more updates in a few days
4026 2018-03-16 22:29:06 I'm neither self righteous or a hypocrite. Westerners forget, the West was built on funding from the East.. The East funded the start of the Western oil boom. I remember when there a lot more oil refineries in the East.
4027 2018-03-16 22:29:03 The US has repeatedly failed to deliver heavy oil and did not construct light water reactors as promised, Clintons administration admitted they hoped North Korea would collapse. The admission of nuclear program as claimed by Bush Jr administration is blatant lie used to break AF.
4028 2018-03-16 22:28:52 How come no one ever talks about the 6 billion gallons of oil that was spilled during the naval battles of WWII? By their logic the English Channel and the South Pacific should be an absolute wasteland.

Goodbye: Cammalari; Schlepachev; Aberg; Kassian, Puljujarvi (I think he’s another bust...but to the minors at least). I’m sure you’d get at least similar goal production if simply inserted players from the AJHL.

4035 2018-03-16 22:27:59 Nah, that's not how oil cleansers work. You could always remove it with a makeup wipe, though, and then use the second cleanser. But you still need to wash off with water.
4036 2018-03-16 22:27:58 Have you started the process of recruiting some oil rig workers to pilot the nuke rockets   ?

4042 2018-03-16 22:27:27 Lets change the subject from politics for a minute.  The economics of oil production is very complicated. For example 35% of the oil platforms are out of production at any one-time.    Keeps the price artificially high.  The request to expand offshore drilling is pure BS

4053 2018-03-16 22:25:48 Both the oil and the wick will change color during use. This is a natural reaction that occurs when oil is heated. Thank you for reaching out to us, Alyssa!

I, too, don't love the beauty water... it was sold as the second coming and it barely registers as sliced bread..
4060 2018-03-16 22:25:03 Use castor oil!
4061 2018-03-16 22:24:53 I relate to this too hard what I’ve done to compensate is wmget a big bowl of warm bubbly/soapy water with some nice oil in it, laid a towel out on the floor in front of my couch and soaked my feet while sitting here reading/computering is very nice

4069 2018-03-16 22:23:56 More plausible for methane, but not so much for more complex hydrocarbons...crude oil (and natural gas) is a composition of numerous hydrocarbon types. Methane being the simplest of them all.
4070 2018-03-16 22:23:39 No oil needed...just wet your lips slightly before you blow it.

4072 2018-03-16 22:23:28 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

4116 2018-03-16 22:16:46 Also companies use this same tactic to attempt to fool people into thinking they are more trustworthy than they are. And snake oil salesmen also buy fake followers to create perceived importance.

4140 2018-03-16 22:12:52 I was in Russia in 2007 (also briefly) & it wasn't the same feeling at all. Oil rubles were flowing all over (at least in Moscow). Russia was cohesive and kind of proud of it. It was the beginning of Putin's actual consolidation of power, in my opinion.
4141 2018-03-16 22:12:26 Russia seems to be in a hard place.  God forbid that Trump lowers the price of oil on the world market.

4166 2018-03-16 22:09:30 Those spills are definitely regrettable, regardless. Most of what has caused them is human negligence or error. I definitely hope that the oil companies learned from that rash of incidents. Outside that group of spills that happened, ruptures are remarkably rare.

4191 2018-03-16 22:05:47 @EricTheCarGuy what is the best way to find an oil leak
4192 2018-03-16 22:05:29 Why is the UAE building a base in Berbera, Somalia? Why is the UAE working to divide Yemen, & retain mercenaries in Yemen? What money do Prince, Trump, & Putin expect from future Yemeni oil contracts? Those violent greedy kleptocrats are scarier than defense contractors.
4193 2018-03-16 22:05:11 Taxation depends on income. The money that governments spend does not grow on trees. That means governments have to provide jobs. Good-paying jobs. Double shifts at Starbucks is not sufficient. Oil, LNG and mining, forestry, fisheries. #bcpoli
4194 2018-03-16 22:05:06 In Saskatchewan, its yet to be determined if we actually emit more  or sequester more. Certainly the move towards Wind and Power isn't going to solve anything. Solar has some uses in household or maybe community applications. So nothing to replace oil yet.
4195 2018-03-16 22:05:05 Yup. I have. The footprint is still smaller than the contributions of oil transported via rail or road. I'd be totally amenable to finding ways around those natural areas & fully compensating those displaced people. Both sides have to work together to find proper consensus. :-)
4196 2018-03-16 22:04:49 I add tea tree or eucalyptus oil. Makes it smell great.

4204 2018-03-16 22:03:12 Has anyone checked into how Vancouver Island gets its fuel? Gas? Oil? Diesel? Apparently by ocean-going barges from Island Tug and Barge Ltd from the mainland to a tank farm near Cowichan Bay. And this doesn't pose an environmental hazard? Check it out!
4205 2018-03-16 22:03:07 @UKPowerNetworks hi there, my parents live in PE13 and their power is low, lights are dim and oil boiler will not run. Is this a power network issue?

4208 2018-03-16 22:02:31 I tend to agree -- with this addition: If the U.K. wants to really hurt Putin & his oligarch cronies, they MUST seize assets in & around London. Homes, land & bulging bank accounts. 

But here's the rub. U.K. & western Europe rely heavily on Russian oil, so they are cautious.
4209 2018-03-16 22:02:26 الله المستعان
4210 2018-03-16 22:02:13 No one believes Trudeau is a champion of Kinder Morgan or any pipeline expansion. Over the next few decades we will continue to need oil regardless technical innovation. Import foreign oil and leave our resources in the ground? Talk about burning money.
4211 2018-03-16 22:02:00 Working for Google is like working in the oil field. You're constantly busting your ass 8-12 hours a day to make others happy. I'm sure that person is jobless and lives in their mommas basement.
4212 2018-03-16 22:01:59 You wicked gurl,y bully the young boi
4213 2018-03-16 22:01:59 If you can, I love your accent saying oil or oily, but something containing that. I’d buy that. Not sure how to convey that on merch though but it’s unique to you and your attitude about it is awesome.
4214 2018-03-16 22:01:46 Does bird = oil companies...he does what his master tells him. Zinke is owned. This entire administration has to go. Unbelievable
4215 2018-03-16 22:01:45 Why is it covered in oil? Yuck
4216 2018-03-16 22:01:41 You cannot give a board power to act when there's no law to back it up. Even the act (law) creating NESREA is silent on oil spill let alone a mere board.
4217 2018-03-16 22:01:26 Get the Italian stuff packed in olive oil. Life changing
4218 2018-03-16 22:01:24 The Bamboos - Eel Oil #NowPlaying
4219 2018-03-16 22:01:22 I think it’s MSM trying not to throw Chiarelli under the bus by saying that the Lucic deal is horrible. Easier to say trade RNH for a dman because he could get a better return. When in reality he screwed the organization over by signing his beantown boy to 6 mil a yr.
4220 2018-03-16 22:01:13 The Alberta Conservatives destroyed the oil sands industry by plain mismanagement. I think most Albertan are very happy with @RachelNotley. Why do people assume that NDP=Big expense. This is false. NDP stands for working Canadians. Strong economy=happy workers.
4221 2018-03-16 22:01:10 @GeorgianaGossip OK, the oil cleanser came. I just want to make sure inhale this right. I apply to dry skin then wash off with creamy cleanser?
4222 2018-03-16 22:00:58 Our tax dollars go to protect private oil industry interest. Not only them. When the 99%er protest were going on at diff banks, corps, ect; we paid for gov infiltrators
4223 2018-03-16 22:00:33 Stop Canadian oil at any Cost. Protests and now US Politicians. If people can’t see what’s going on, then they must be blind and stupid. Canada needs another Market for our resources
4224 2018-03-16 22:00:32 Why can't you have a wrestlmania at Lucas oil stadium in Indianapolis

4226 2018-03-16 22:00:21  get a little bowl of alcohol and water and a drop of oil & let them soak .

4229 2018-03-16 21:59:58 Fresh oil change. My car running smooveeee agajn
4230 2018-03-16 21:59:53 I wish I could get an oil change without talking to anyone lol
4231 2018-03-16 21:59:46 If you want to shift the discussion to the Environmental (E) costs of battery production from mining raw materials to end of life recycling we can. So what are the E cost(s) of Tar Sands Oil Production & Fracking. including oil spill & site restoration, but excluding subsidies?
4232 2018-03-16 21:59:34 The video is too short to accurately assess Zinke's full response. He's a tool of big oil, but we need to critique him on his full response, in my opinion.
4233 2018-03-16 21:59:24 I bet the barriers for women are huge, it couldn't be that they don't want to do it..  

Its never an issue for refuse collection or working on oil rigs.
4234 2018-03-16 21:58:48 They have local region, and low level capability. Blocking it probably limits their own oil exports. They like their 'swarms' of little boats.
4235 2018-03-16 21:58:30 Yeh lets burn all the coal oil & gas. Make a few people really rich. Because it's better to be greedy now and take everything from future generations. No one cares about them anyway. While were at it lets destroy the food chain and kill all the fish first.
Because we can!
4236 2018-03-16 21:58:28 While I'm pleased women are encouraging and promoting women in energy, the oil business - underscored by the ridiculous tone deaf speeches at the women in energy event - is the worst, and only worsened by the female apologists for it. And I covered private equity 10 years ago
4237 2018-03-16 21:58:26 @TravelerStadium Nice! If you're ever in the area again and need a car wash or oil change, keep us in mind?
4238 2018-03-16 21:58:17 Please Nigeria where are we heading?  Solar energy is taking over, vehicles and equipments are electrical. The use of our oil is gradually going into extinct. Our Government where is the future for us? How do we survive in 20years? Am still young
4239 2018-03-16 21:58:15 We just got some new *Portland Glue 1G - Hood Oil*
4240 2018-03-16 21:58:08 I just dropped a BRAND NEW bottle of face oil and that shit ain’t cheap
4241 2018-03-16 21:58:05 get that baby oil ready my melanin queens SUMMER IS APPROACHING  skin finna to look like fresh chocolate bar 
4242 2018-03-16 21:58:00 *jonah voice* water with coconut oil in it
4243 2018-03-16 21:57:56 The original snake oil salesman 
4244 2018-03-16 21:57:46 Look at the UK and see what the Muslim religious people have done. They need to go back to their country and rebuild the mess they helped create. We don’t need their oil nor their money. They won’t find it as easy to indoctrinate here!
4245 2018-03-16 21:57:45 they all go bad, at least for the small business owners he bilks. about the only thing he’s good at is bilking other people out of their money. a natural born snake oil con man.
4246 2018-03-16 21:57:44 We share a border with Canada here, at night you can see miles off shore in Lake Saint Clair Canada’s wind turbine red lights to steer the freighters clear. It’s inspring to see progress. They help ID the shipping channel; but they provide clean energy as well. Not an oil derrick
4247 2018-03-16 21:57:40 We have plenty of oil here.  Go home!
4248 2018-03-16 21:57:14 It’s like Medieval Catholics shocked that Protestants and Jews weren’t secretly demons who ate babies.  They still burned them at stake, though.
4249 2018-03-16 21:57:09 Grape seed oil!!
4250 2018-03-16 21:57:05 LMAO she said she puts oil underneath  i'm honestly baffled
4251 2018-03-16 21:56:37 I really really REALLY wanna do research with cannabis oil and cancer cells. I’ve been watching so many videos and tons of people are claiming that the oils have cured their cancer. It’s amazing.
4252 2018-03-16 21:56:36 @nkilvert Yet another article which makes us believe Australia's population will be 40 million by 2050. Shortages of resources (water, oil, power) will not allow this. There will be much more re-use and recycling as people will have less money
4253 2018-03-16 21:56:27 When I was bleaching my hair, I would put coconut oil on the strands before bed and wash it out in the morning
4254 2018-03-16 21:56:10 Llama la atención que salvo Roa el resto de los diarios omita nuevo papelón de Alberto en caso Oil
4255 2018-03-16 21:56:06 Proof the anti-gun walkout was wholly approved and abetted by the school.
4256 2018-03-16 21:56:02 they could make a regulation that says oil workers have to do the hokey pokey before they start work every day. Regulations are not inherently rational or even useful. And you miss the point entirely as the energy board is a NATIONAL jurisdiction - the province has no say here.
4257 2018-03-16 21:56:01 Stop oil drilling in our national parks
//secure.greenpeace.org.uk/acid-drilling-ty
4258 2018-03-16 21:55:57 Keep hair ties and claw clips EVERYWHERE. They WILL get lost.

I chemically straighten my hair and then flat iron so it's easier to manage.

The right shampoo and conditioner are essential for longer hair. 

Argan oil for frizz and softness.

Ponytail if you can't be bothered.
4259 2018-03-16 21:55:56 Just wait till they legally start voting. 
Its coming.
4260 2018-03-16 21:55:53 Might try spraying peppermint oil (mixed with water) to keep rodents out. It works well. Looks like one was making a nest in there.
4261 2018-03-16 21:55:34 The USA is in Syria illegally for OIL and needs to get out. End of story but the Oligarchs want there $$$$
4262 2018-03-16 21:55:32 Too bad the bump from fracked tight oil consists mostly of super/ultra light that very few refiners can actually refine.
4263 2018-03-16 21:55:24 Just climbed on the roof and sprayed my satellite dish with cooking oil. Clear signal now. The things we do for #marchmadness
4264 2018-03-16 21:54:49 But yup...Us pls farts triggered you...Yup yup.
4265 2018-03-16 21:54:41 Don’t understand why I started putting oil on my oily skin again
4266 2018-03-16 21:54:40 If you really think about it, a pipeline is just a big dick that jizzes out heavy oil. It's pretty fucked up that BC is body shaming us for wanting to build a big-ass dick.
4267 2018-03-16 21:54:31 Go solar to hell with oil gold wall street politicians thieves banks...
4268 2018-03-16 21:54:29  not even toast or noodles tossed in olive oil?
4269 2018-03-16 21:54:25 I don't care how fancy the pizza is, it will go better with beer than wine. Is it an oil thing? An acid thing? I don't know. I'm not a scientist. But I bet this could be objectively proven.
4270 2018-03-16 21:54:22 If i wore my natural hair more i would deff get the black castor oil eco styling gel my job just got
4271 2018-03-16 21:54:20 curry shrimp would be so oil rn
4272 2018-03-16 21:54:17 Hot oil treatments feel so good on your scalp 
4273 2018-03-16 21:54:16 Avocado oil chips 
4274 2018-03-16 21:54:05 Brown sugar and coconut oil is my holy grail when it comes to exfoliating....oh, also lemon and brown sugar on your vag helps with lightening skin and stop ingrown hairs
4275 2018-03-16 21:53:56 @HarrisCountyDAO is a hateful organization. Just look at it's history. Overzealous attacks on defendants from a position of hatred, not love. Powered by bloody oil revenue, known worldwide as a terrorist org, violating human rights en masse. Stand up, Rice. Have some backbone.
4276 2018-03-16 21:53:56 Dabs, wax, shatter, oil
4277 2018-03-16 21:53:43 Page is the managing partner of Global Energy Capital, a one-man investment fund and consulting firm specializing in the Russian and Central Asian oil and gas. Wouldn’t you think he’d have some sort of idea connection considering 50% of his biz comes from Moscow?
4278 2018-03-16 21:53:27 Oil prices... We have such a diversified economy.
4279 2018-03-16 21:53:13 There are two good reasons, the minor one is to make it impossible for the Russians to use their harbour in Syria, Tartus, the main reason is for Total and Engie, there is for ± 400 billion worth of oil and gas in Syrian waters. Russia got the exploration rights.
4280 2018-03-16 21:53:10 Ya cuz they’re the only ones buying your snake oil
4281 2018-03-16 21:52:53 Try oil first. See what you look like.
4282 2018-03-16 21:52:18 Me too extra mayo black pepper lite mustard and oil
4283 2018-03-16 21:52:02 We pay and they give oil so no one can live without each other. They should respect us in their country and we should do the same here.
4284 2018-03-16 21:52:01 But he has no problem with the 5 refineries in his state receiving oil by tanker from Alaska.
4285 2018-03-16 21:51:54 As I suspected; current escalation has a very big part to do with fossil fools ENERGY CONTROL; big oil gangs, gas, pipelines, drilling. 
cfr israel u.s. congress gave genie energy rights to illegally drill golan heights/syria and Genie Energy have/are violating international law.
4286 2018-03-16 21:51:45 Anybody in #Houston know of any good recruiters for Oil & Gas HR or Health Care Managment professionals??
4287 2018-03-16 21:51:27 Can we talk about wildlife killed and injured by oil spills?
4288 2018-03-16 21:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》

4289 2018-03-16 21:51:19 Not to mention all other damage such as armed conflict #MEFTA will agitate. Oil and the US have a bad history!
4290 2018-03-16 21:51:13 ..that have been tortured by there "owners" first. Left to die after having burning oil , ears cut off, tails, legs, ...in the UK.

4294 2018-03-16 21:51:01 yknow what im a fake bitch tho cos i still havent gotten past oil ocean act 2 in mania
4295 2018-03-16 21:50:48 Our vessel (body) is a lampstand. In order to keep shining, we must continue to fill our lampstand with the oil of God; which is the Holy Spirit and Word of God. Our light should never go dim or burn out.
4296 2018-03-16 21:50:47 Annual?
4297 2018-03-16 21:50:45 Tony told me his mum got her nails done and I said what kind, he replied ‘Yano when there is oil spilled on the ground’ , they are holographic 
4298 2018-03-16 21:50:39 There is a big difference between tankers carrying dilbit and tankers carrying medium grade crude oil. But you knew that already right?
#bcpoli
4299 2018-03-16 21:50:39 @itsbl0ndie hey girl! Love your channel and love watching your reviews but I just wanted to know what your thoughts on the Smashbox primer oil? If you have tried it. Thanks!
4300 2018-03-16 21:50:37 @rickygervais Just spotted a Reuters post on oil prices. I'm now wondering of a future where investors watch the price of David Brent Crude..
4301 2018-03-16 21:50:36 I also worked in the oil patch. It doesn't prove knowledge of issues. The Sturgeon refinery is too little too late but it will help a bit. It costs $10 B for a refinery and takes about 10 yrs to build. There won't be any new refineries anytime soon.
4302 2018-03-16 21:50:09 I like taking fish oil pills but miss that normal taste that only not taking fish oil pills can bring
4303 2018-03-16 21:50:05 Pedophile
4304 2018-03-16 21:49:54 Good article but they blame the 2008 recession and the drop in price for oil in 2014 damaged the economy. The article also says that Canada is now on the right path to better wage growth which the minimum wage did increase.
4305 2018-03-16 21:49:47 'STOP KILLING ALL THE RICH BLACKS AROUND THE WORLD, KILLING THE KIDS BLOWING UP THEY SCHOOLS TAKING THEY LAND.  STOP STEALING OIL AND POPPY!   YOU BITCHES!!!   ANTHONY D. HILL
4306 2018-03-16 21:49:43 My mom got a oil change for me  
4307 2018-03-16 21:49:40 Wonder if I can move this oil to another cartridge lol
4308 2018-03-16 21:49:17 Think the Exxon Valdez spill was particularly bad? Every 8 months the same volume of oil washes off US roads into the sea.
4309 2018-03-16 21:49:15 I have to dust off my writing skills. They need a lil oil
4310 2018-03-16 21:49:09 This isn’t about tourism, Trump wants to drill for oil in national parks in U.S. & roll back enviro regs.  This is about a climate-denying billionaire lobbying our minister for tourism to stop a renewable project.
4311 2018-03-16 21:49:03 Lol you should know donuts...About the only thing you can have sweet sex with...Heck...The entire froggy will go through the donut hole..
4312 2018-03-16 21:48:45 The horror.
4313 2018-03-16 21:48:43 I'd hope you also realize that nairobi is heavily polluted, raw sewage and industrial affluent run   openly, many garage's are operated in open places motor oil and petroleum products are spilled in the ground flowing into waterways..
Still think its a nice idea? Mhhh!
4314 2018-03-16 21:48:36 Who watches this fool? I turn the channel.
4315 2018-03-16 21:48:26 They'll probably lose their jobs over it and have to apologize publicly to the illegal immigrant "community".
4316 2018-03-16 21:48:21 What does that have to do with paying for your sucky oil?
4317 2018-03-16 21:48:21 Bones don’t turn to oil 
4318 2018-03-16 21:48:14 Fuck no I wish lol I took castor oil just to see & now a bitch has the bubble guts 
4319 2018-03-16 21:48:13 Terrible advice like this is why people keeping using coconut oil, lemon juice and sugar on they whole entire face and wondering why it's a mess 
4320 2018-03-16 21:48:04 As far as I can tell many of the people I meet in life are snake oil salesmen.
4321 2018-03-16 21:47:59 Just spent 94 and gotta spend some on an oil change Monday. Work got me on some good hours tho so I ain’t sweating too much but still, I gotta be careful y’know chief
4322 2018-03-16 21:47:53 I do not think Russians are scared of the Vicar of Dibley They have Orthodox Christianity Much tougher and Snow Wheat Forests Oil Gas Architecture and Tea and Butter We ran out of butter once and yet have the biggest Dairy Industry you can think of, Redundant cows litter England
4323 2018-03-16 21:47:47 As it turns out, being 14,000 miles over for getting my oil changed was the LEAST WRONG thing in my car, and it is now in the shop for the next little bit while they replace my brakes, callipers, and rear suspension.
4324 2018-03-16 21:47:29 @SecretaryZinke is a fraud & appointed puppet w/no legal authority. @RepRobBishop put a lie into House budget devaluing federal land so it would be easier to steal by transferring through DOI to states for sale & lease to oil, gas, coal & timber. It is all illegal-based on a lie.
4325 2018-03-16 21:47:25 It’s Zinke, the big Montana hunter head of the dept that is shrinking our national parks and allowing oil pipelines across them. He’s selling off public lands for oil exploration
Get the greedy corrupt Trump admin out of office! 
Trumps going down soon ans horror show with him!
4326 2018-03-16 21:47:07 This was the very first thing on my feed and I can understand why. So much wisdom and courage fills this tweet. Thank you "Oil Tot".
4327 2018-03-16 21:47:05 #FunFactFriday A spider’s body has an oil on it to keep the #spider from sticking to it’s own web.
4328 2018-03-16 21:47:04 I was just saying my car needs an oil change. Where is this garage?!? Lol!!
4329 2018-03-16 21:47:03 First of all. Who told my car to take full synthetic oil??!
4330 2018-03-16 21:46:51 Haha that's what shade of green he was last Sunday after a night out with the Oil Kings.
4331 2018-03-16 21:46:48 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
4332 2018-03-16 21:46:40 The mechanisms which resulted in @realDonaldTrump installation took decades to develop and state level spy master logistics to orchestrate. Covert ops were #Putin's main asset after #Oil reserves. It was subvert democracy and recover influence or be crushed under larger economies
4333 2018-03-16 21:46:34 My formula for success is rise early,work late,and strike oil,
4334 2018-03-16 21:46:26 Naw..mabe a little canna oil.
4335 2018-03-16 21:46:25 Cracked the oil pan again on my car. It’s time for a trade

4345 2018-03-16 21:44:28 Make sure you mention the Alaskan oil tankers off the coast every day to Seattle,Portland,and California
4346 2018-03-16 21:44:26 I'm not about blocking supply. I'm about not risking my economy, environment and livelihood so a US based Oil company operating in Alberta can ship Canadian oil resources to China. If Alberta wants to process Bitumen in Alberta, I'm totally in favor of it

4350 2018-03-16 21:44:04 Is Erik Prince’s plan to divide Yemen for future oil profits, on top of his mercenary profits, causing him to use the UAE to lobby for continued US support of the immoral & ill-advised Yemen War? He is destabilizing the entire ME & inviting Putin to share the spoils.
4351 2018-03-16 21:43:52 Get frankincense oil
4352 2018-03-16 21:43:48 I am optimistic that @jacindaardern and @Megan_Woods will do the right thing. With communities in the Pacific suffering impacts of climate change right now, NZ allowing oil & gas exploration is morally indefensible.

Changed her oil and oil filter. 

Topped off her fluids.

Even gave her belts some conditioner. 

I hope she kindly returns the favor with a trouble free journey. 

Side note: look like a clown car I've got so much in here!

4357 2018-03-16 21:43:16 Historically sanctions usually lead to war. The US should seriously think about the end goal of sanctions,they can lead to war. Research the history of sanctions. When the US put oil sanctions on the Japanese they attacked pearl harbour and invaded the Dutch East Indies for oil.
4358 2018-03-16 21:43:13 What, a guy can’t pull off a long nap on a Friday afternoon? Plus their changing the oil on AF1 before he goes to Mar-a-lago.

4360 2018-03-16 21:43:03 I think a more efficient way of putting pressure on Putin/the oligarchs is sectoral sections—i.e., on oil, natural gas, and all their derivatives—as well as sanctions on financial transfers and transactions. Restrictions on visas are meaningless, mean, & help Putin’s case

4368 2018-03-16 21:42:01 Canada's govt isnt going to help. The politicians are bought and paid for by oil companies. It's up to us to buy and promote electric vehicles and to install solar in places that use coal for electricity

I guess you are correct, as Imperial Oil is technically Canadian too.

4372 2018-03-16 21:41:03 Thought they stopped drilling for oil there in the 80’s ? Lots of plugged oil wells there still.
4373 2018-03-16 21:40:26 I wish there were more clean with me videos that weren't about essential oil mommies and their kids

4382 2018-03-16 21:39:32 its hard to know bc things work so differently for everyone. i guess just get hydrating face masks etc then use drying stuff/oil reducing face washes etc on ur oily areas
4383 2018-03-16 21:39:08 Sheesh. My sister just brought it home. I wonder where she got it.

Does the Lemon Essence have lemon oil in it?
4384 2018-03-16 21:39:01 I’ve heard that garnier water bomb is a dupe for aqua bomb but I’ve not used it so I can’t attest to that. The bio oil and vitamin c serum are my legit ride or dies. The bio oil is sooooo good for dry skin & over time it’s improved my skin texture and pigmentation

4397 2018-03-16 21:36:51 Peeled garlic is kind of crappy, but buy one of those big plastic delis full of it, put in a small sauce pan, oil to cover, oven ~225 (or just super slow) for like an hour. Garlic oil + garlic confit for the week. Super useful to have on hand.
4398 2018-03-16 21:36:49 Well you and I know that’s rubbish. If everyone was anti-war, if no one stood to gain from it, whether it be an arms trader/manufacturer, an oil seeker, a tyrant, an empire maker, a madman... there would be no war...  what’s history taught is? Some people love it.
4399 2018-03-16 21:36:46 lol so I guess it brings up her immune system and helps her fight off allergies? I know my had to take it once when her liver wasn't doing well. Who knew fish oil was that good

4415 2018-03-16 21:32:33 Maybe you should rub your forehead and apply that oil you get from there onto the rest of your face? Might help? Idk suggestion? Idk maybe I’ll just stop talking?

4419 2018-03-16 21:32:06 the secret is just reusing the same oil over and over again, I think

4462 2018-03-16 21:26:34 Fantastic, but this proposal is for 7 times more oil tankers out of Westridge through the Burrard Inlet and through our cities. What you’re talking about and what this is all about are 2 very different things. #bcpoli #cdnpoli

4469 2018-03-16 21:25:34 Why don’t you just sit down and shut up and let the people who know something about their jobs handle it. You best get back to calling the banks and oil companies for donations. You’re going to need them this November.

4476 2018-03-16 21:24:58 This is old news only now it’s Russia before it was N. Korea. Maybe NK is trading off with Russia. After all Russia is supplying NK food, oil and everything else.
4477 2018-03-16 21:24:56 Regardless of party, this guy is right...there is one heck of a clean-up bill coming and none of the parties who have been in government has held Big Oil's feet to the fire.  Get ready to open your wallets, #Alberta taxpayers. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

4485 2018-03-16 21:23:42 @MarieSutter8 ca c'est grâce à mon bi oil 
4486 2018-03-16 21:23:29 70% of Canadian crude is refined into diesel or gas, put a ten percent dent in that globally and tell me what the impact would be on crude demand. Oil isn't going away but the oil sands aren't far from being obsolete. They won't be viable for long
4487 2018-03-16 21:23:23 Oil is dying????
What is you replacement?
Absolutely every physical thing you can see, touch and eat required oil to get it to you. There is certainly no viable alternatives at this point.
4488 2018-03-16 21:23:19 Me iba a poner bio oil en la cara y me pasé acetona sin querer MI CARA ESTA EN FUEGO. Ser bruta es cosa seria.
4489 2018-03-16 21:23:02 Rick Perry thought the Department of Energy was all about that oil. It’s really a lot about nukes.
4490 2018-03-16 21:22:43 U.S. Adds One NatGas Rig as BHI Tally Rises on Oil
4491 2018-03-16 21:22:21 AZ, it’s gotta be the Kleenex. I think he’s back in his moms basement.
4492 2018-03-16 21:22:19 I'd argue that we need most of the major industrial countries on board, including China, in order to cut demand for fossil fuels. If we can cut demand, there won't be much profit in high-cost oil production.
4493 2018-03-16 21:22:16 Texas has oil money, control Congress, why easy for them. Way out on the western frontier, you got very little coming?
4494 2018-03-16 21:22:09 The companies report that corrosion causes many spills. Also what's your evidence for claiming that main reason for slow response is fault of communities? There's evidence in the oil spill reports that this happens occasionally but not all the time  @ReutersBiz
4495 2018-03-16 21:22:08 It’s one of the more embarrassing parts of being an Oil fan, and that’s a tough shitpile to stay on top of.
4496 2018-03-16 21:21:57  get your oil changed.

4498 2018-03-16 21:21:38 Shaka Smart sounds like Doc Rivers
Similar amount of head oil
4499 2018-03-16 21:21:37 It makes me happy to know I can change my own oil and fix some things on my car by myself, example my brakes for the 4th time in the last month because caliber was bad and then I was given the wrong one  it’s just a good feeling ya know 
4500 2018-03-16 21:21:33 imagine if u ordered sweat jeans and they gave u regular jeans. U WOULD BE INCENSED!!!
4501 2018-03-16 21:21:16 From MS to wrinkles!  That’s one amazzzing essential oil.  
4502 2018-03-16 21:21:14 You don't have to know the terms to do it?

Anyone can download Photoshop or any similar program and mess around with it. Also: Adobe Illustrator is a vector program. You can draw/paint like this with it.

Like seriously this is the Photoshop CS6 oil paint filter???
4503 2018-03-16 21:21:13 This man cooked rice for himself and I see almost one bottle of oil at the bottom of the pot. 
4504 2018-03-16 21:21:02 Mini oil lamps just came in!  They are so cute!
4505 2018-03-16 21:21:01 Coconut oil 1-2x a week! Ive been trying this hair mask by Amika and it smells so good and it makes my hair so soft! 10/10 would recommend
4506 2018-03-16 21:20:45 Na I'm going to focus my time on the Calgary Oil Barons playoff run #winnerswin
4507 2018-03-16 21:20:41 You're an a*****e @Oil_Guns_Merica
4508 2018-03-16 21:20:25 Playing with my oil paints! 
4509 2018-03-16 21:20:22 add oil 
4510 2018-03-16 21:20:12 A lot more oil and gas in Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan I would argue is more rural than either Alberta or Manitoba.
4511 2018-03-16 21:20:04 How do people actually sniff solvents without dying, I’ve been using oil based stuff 2 nights in a row and I’m done in from the fumes 
4512 2018-03-16 21:20:03 They don't have to invest in our country. We can do everything that they are going to do. Think about that. All the oil money for such a small country. We supposed to be looking like Dubai not looking for handouts. We have failed to advance. Take the slap and hush.
4513 2018-03-16 21:19:46 Hope rmthey dnt take all day changing this oil
4514 2018-03-16 21:19:41 Coconut oil actually blocks up your pores
4515 2018-03-16 21:19:11 I got my oil cleanser in my eyeballs and im lowkey crying
4516 2018-03-16 21:19:11 It’s amazing I just drain the can a lil bit & then I put the chickpeas in a pan & smash them with potato smasher until they are not so clumpy & then I turn on the flame & add oil, and just add as much oil until they aren’t dry anymore & wa laaaaa
4517 2018-03-16 21:19:05 colour the whole thing grey then add others, lock the base colour layer and use an oil/acrylic brush! clipping won't work bc it doesn't blend, using the blend tool decreases contrast, shadows aren't all gradients lol

use oranges and reds for skin <33 you can do it, hwaiting!!!!
4518 2018-03-16 21:18:56 i was reading off what bio oil is to my teacher and one of them is “helps aging skin” and he’s like “yeah i’ve noticed you look a lot younger
4519 2018-03-16 21:18:53 I only learned the signal for "I forgot to change the oil in my car"
4520 2018-03-16 21:18:50 I don’t like almond oil
4521 2018-03-16 21:18:45 wow i just asked my friend what my new twitter name should be and she said baby oil golden goddess. bye bitch
4522 2018-03-16 21:18:39 Yes, cut a lemon in half and apply the lemon onto the scar for a few minutes so it can absorb the juices. Another option is olive oil. Honey is also another good option.
4523 2018-03-16 21:18:27 It's not really armor, it's more like a layer of fat, padding. With some oil it'll shine right up.
4524 2018-03-16 21:18:26 Its about time we invaded space for oil.
4525 2018-03-16 21:18:21 @deepriversnacks Really knows how to make chips like I think I've become addicted to the Rosemary and Olive oil flavor 
4526 2018-03-16 21:18:19 You’re losing th PR battle @BlairKing_ca because you’re up against so many walls, so many common sense environmental reasons why taking it to the coast won’t happen. Each wall gets bigger all the way up to oil tankers and oil spills. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4527 2018-03-16 21:18:08 Ivory black, also known as bone char, was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil.
4528 2018-03-16 21:18:04 I feel really bad for the kid.  Those adults did this to him.  He looks so confused and disappointed.
4529 2018-03-16 21:17:48 Have you tried CBD oil?
4530 2018-03-16 21:17:38 I have to stop using Eco because every time I use it after putting any type of oil in my hair it flakes. It was good while it lasted but now I need a real moisturizer
4531 2018-03-16 21:17:32 Never mind. That's Olive Oil. 
4532 2018-03-16 21:17:29 The team that says don't worry about it because the cheap oil is about to run out and the electric grid can't function very well without it. Might have a few solar-powered laptops about, but supercomputers taking over the world? Where you going to get the juice for that?
4533 2018-03-16 21:17:06 Haha yup. At the Nissan dealership while I was getting an oil change
4534 2018-03-16 21:17:04 As a man raising my son to be a man. This is  garbage.
4535 2018-03-16 21:17:02 And even if I were as old as froggy makes me to be....Why does it think that being called old is an insult? Frogs are weird creatures indeed ...
4536 2018-03-16 21:16:48 50 dollars for a damn oil change 
4537 2018-03-16 21:16:47 TFW you believed the snake oil salesman and ended up with, well, snake oil.
4538 2018-03-16 21:16:43 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for probiotic vodka, and put some orange zest essential oil in my diffuser.

4542 2018-03-16 21:15:59 Of course national security is part of the presidents authority, dodo. That said Mexico should build it just on their side. If they refuse we should take over their oil fields by force. Drugs and terrorists are at war w our children. Its DEFENSE NOT OFFENSE. stop invasion.
4543 2018-03-16 21:15:30 Damn froggies get triggered do easily....lol
4544 2018-03-16 21:15:22 This girl saying don’t use coconut oil on ur face and I though this was common knowledge
4545 2018-03-16 21:15:17 Norway relies on oil money to fund its welfare state. What happens when it runs out? Also, nearly all of these countries are able to build their "socialism" because of US imperialism.
4546 2018-03-16 21:15:17 Today is so nice and the perfect day to get my oil changed but I guess the rest of Ada thinks so too
4547 2018-03-16 21:14:59 120 yrs of #Victoria pumping raw sewage into Juan de Fuca has done more environmental damage than 70 yrs of oil tankers moving through without incident ...
4548 2018-03-16 21:14:58 Coconut oil!
4549 2018-03-16 21:14:41 Just been looking at the photos of the embankment collapse - didnt realise how big it was - certainly trumps the oil spill. I think its going to be more than 2 days! 
4550 2018-03-16 21:14:38 Lol. He was allowed to get away with murder at Freddie’s Fashion mart
4551 2018-03-16 21:14:32 Yep NH...first in the union primary!  Borders sea and Canada so ICE reigns supreme.  An hour out of Logan AP in Boston.  Full up trumpling governor. Two corporate Dem women Senators who sold us out to big oil.  Used to be farmers and workers....now it’s gun freaks and malice.
4552 2018-03-16 21:14:20 Coincidentally, I'm awaiting an oil change on the same block where Elvis once broke up a fight.
4553 2018-03-16 21:14:20 super purge avec Oil et Ash
4554 2018-03-16 21:14:17 Those sanctions helped Russia in the long run.
Russia started to be less depended on gas/oil and on foreign imports.
So thanks America, give Russia please more sanctions
4555 2018-03-16 21:14:14 Did you just change your oil or something?  Jesus!  Hahaha.
4556 2018-03-16 21:14:04 Funny how we are constantly reminded of the deficit, but money available for tax scam, flying military, special doors, dining tables, trumps 400 vacations and yet they want to cut what we actually paid for: SS & Medicare. But then again they must keep giving free money to Oil Co
4557 2018-03-16 21:14:03 I got to cool it with my baby karma been roadtrippin too much she need an oil change
4558 2018-03-16 21:14:02 Obama: "Their economy doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms. They don’t innovate." Why have they failed to diversify their economies? I mean, there is no shortage of talents in Russia.
4559 2018-03-16 21:13:57 Most of the brightest minds left the Oil business long ago.
4560 2018-03-16 21:13:52 Went into @Ford to get The Works oil change and my broken stereo diagnosed. Waited 5.5 hours and the stereo still wasn’t even looked at. So glad they care. Waste of a day.  #frustrated #annoyed

4562 2018-03-16 21:13:22 Trade not aid hasn't helped much either. I tried to organise export of fruit from Nigeria. No cold stores or reefer trucks even at the ports. Non oil trade about what the Portuguese explorers found. Spice!
4563 2018-03-16 21:13:08 #Diva
4564 2018-03-16 21:13:05 Not so! An oil spill would impact us all here on the coast, right up to and including the folks who made their fortunes in business, bought multi million dollar estates along the coast and who don’t want that spoiled by an oil spill...and everyone in between. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4565 2018-03-16 21:13:04 Car wash done  and now oil change.
4566 2018-03-16 21:13:01 Tea tree and peppermint  oil for ingrown hairs. Thank me later
4567 2018-03-16 21:12:55 If I was in the market for spin and snake oil I’d be giving ol’ @afshinrattansi a call. Wow is he slick. Clearly got some HUGE issues with this country historically and politically. His beach house in Sochi is on Owners  Direct mind.... #bbcqt
4568 2018-03-16 21:12:50 Oh, I wasnt aware. Darn, I thought that was the Holy Grail of a solution.
4569 2018-03-16 21:12:47 Perks of living in a small town: 
*walks into Napa Auto Parts
Cashier: “what you need today?”
Me: “quart of oil”
Cashier: “if it’s for your car, I recommend the silver bottle second shelf down on the right. Charge it to Robert?”
Me: “yes sir”
Cashier: “ok thanks, see you later”
4570 2018-03-16 21:12:20 Coconut oil all over my body is so heavenly
4571 2018-03-16 21:12:06 I actually prefer oil rigs to private herds of cattle on federal land. The rigs don't compete for the space, water or grazing and won't attack the wild animals. And knowing a few roughnecks, they'll be bringing the horses carrots and other treats.
4572 2018-03-16 21:12:03 well he should complain if he orders a Diet Pepsi and gets a regular one.
4573 2018-03-16 21:11:42 You do realize, John, that rather than fight for all that, Dems backed making us the #1 arms dealer and frackers and oil extractors, with tax breaks, and approved all of Trump's appointments while they let GOP break records blocking Obama's. #McResistance
4574 2018-03-16 21:11:39 once the oil in the butter {FYI: THC is fat soluble which is why it doesn't work that good as a tea, but, works great in baked-baked goods...so, since the THC would be in ALLLL the fats in the butter they were right to charge it as such under the law...
4575 2018-03-16 21:11:36 -a little bit of baking soda 
-lavender (oil or dried buds)
-coconut oil
-bubble bath solution

4576 2018-03-16 21:10:55 and both powered by oil money  amazing how history echoes. hope we get the sixth so i can troll rival fans with this 

4577 2018-03-16 21:10:45 Deleted?
4578 2018-03-16 21:10:40 And the doilies, don't want them getting full of oil neither.
4579 2018-03-16 21:10:32 @cromwellc belated thanks to ur compliance folks for yesterday's C/E on $100 million m/c promo p&d "oil" issuer in OK/BC.

Got spring fever, kicking back and chilling the rest of the month.
4580 2018-03-16 21:10:28 The vet seems to think so. When I was little my mother tried to force feed me cod fish oil to help with my immune system. I wasn’t for it though. Lol

4583 2018-03-16 21:10:08 @USBC Come on Angie Brown fly the flag for the UK, there is oil there use it and bring some back to Taunton. Cads
4584 2018-03-16 21:10:08 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
4585 2018-03-16 21:09:59 I also use some beard oil the night before. Combing into the style I want and come the morning, it will behave and go the way I want too. Getcha self a nice mustache comb and comb that bad boy every night.
4586 2018-03-16 21:09:44 Palm oil - it’s in everything.
4587 2018-03-16 21:09:24 @BennyJshow we want want legal weed and industrial Hemp too...
Hemp is the miracle plant fiber and oil, that makes everything from paper, sails, cement, plastic, fuel, etc... it'll help turn the ag economy around too!
#LegalizeIt
4588 2018-03-16 21:09:13 It was Russia that supported Germany in 1939. Russia supplied oil, grain and other materials until Germany attacked in 1941. The U.K. fought fascism.
4589 2018-03-16 21:08:55 y las elecciones de aqui no han sido fraude?
4590 2018-03-16 21:08:54 Yeah we must be like 1000 in frog years. 
4591 2018-03-16 21:08:52 Why? Are other kinds of restraining orders abused?
4592 2018-03-16 21:08:47 @JJBabbles about your lipbalm saga... Maybe try a mix of lanolin and jojoba oil? Unless jojoba oil naturally has vitamin e in it, it should be out of the question. 
Or consider almond oil?
4593 2018-03-16 21:08:45 Hi Paul, thanks for covering our report, but this line in your article is wrong: "While oil companies frequently attribute spills to sabotage and theft, locals say they are often due to other issues such as corrosion."
4594 2018-03-16 21:08:36 + He liked oil paints more than crayons.

He let himself fall onto the bed and groaned at the contact.

It's comfy. Definitely comfier than his own bed. Hella fluffy. Wow.

"You slept here everyday?" He asked, slightly jealous but didn't show it much.
4595 2018-03-16 21:08:30 Only to find out after you replace the bottom bracket that your derailleur hanger is loose and those blade spikes need a little oil after you wash the wheel.
4596 2018-03-16 21:08:27 He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine
4597 2018-03-16 21:08:22 Ethical oil?
Once again, parroted propaganda
4598 2018-03-16 21:08:14 Trump made it easier for big corporations to pollute our water. Someday there will be Wars about water there are already Wars about oil. In the future we will Frack the world to death there will be more earthquakes. Global warming could destroy fishing by destroying the reefs sad
4599 2018-03-16 21:07:56 Lips pressed together, a laugh vibrating in the back of the Ginger’s throat.

“What do I want with him?”

He asked, in somewhat disbelief.

“What /I/ want, is for him to let loose! To break the ice! /Oil the works/.”

Eyebrows raised, winkles forming across his forehead.
4600 2018-03-16 21:07:55 I always smell like roses and coconut oil. My two fav scents 
4601 2018-03-16 21:07:47 baby oil in a bubble bath >
4602 2018-03-16 21:07:41 Maybe their trash because I don’t see Sears Holdings/Kmart lasting too much longer. Only went to them a few times in the past few years for cheap Groupon oil changes at Sears.
4603 2018-03-16 21:07:17 Extra virgin is extracted with less heat than other types, and it has a lower smoke point. It also meets certain acidity tests in a lab. Pure means nothing. Pure oil can still be refined and have a higher smoke point than extra virgin.
4604 2018-03-16 21:07:01 y eso porque Delsy no entregaras el poder? asi esta tu alma de corrupta que tienes miedo de rendir cuenta de la administracion de los cargos que has desempeñado en tan nefasto gobierno.
4605 2018-03-16 21:06:57 Happy birthday btw, we must now seize our Sovereignity back from WM. It's clearer every day they have no intention of loosening their grasp of our land, resources, Islands, Coasts, minerals , gas, oil, or our people. UKG will concede zero to HR. Their #powergrab  means no HR!
4606 2018-03-16 21:06:55 Mmm my girlfriend pays all of our bills and I pay my car insurance and phone bill  only because I do literally everything else cook,clean, wash clothes, change oil on our cars, etc. and take care of the kids it’s he least she can do
4607 2018-03-16 21:06:42 Prime Minister @jacindaardern not committing to implementing all recommendations from Climate Commission. She also won’t commit to ending oil and gas exploration permits. "I’m not going to pre-empt that decision, but we’re working on it." #nationnz #nzpol
4608 2018-03-16 21:06:38 Lol...mourinho and taking responsibilities is like mixing oil and water
4609 2018-03-16 21:06:23 Kudlow
 In 2014 he argued lower oil prices are unambiguously good -- versus the Fed’s and most economists’ view that there are winners and losers to lower oil prices as the U.S. has become a bigger producer.
4610 2018-03-16 21:06:18 I told you back pain , so you should have got something other than baby oil 
4611 2018-03-16 21:06:08 Your national #Arctic policy: Let Big Oil do whatever the *#>* they want to do.
4612 2018-03-16 21:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
4613 2018-03-16 21:05:56 Apple cider vinegar is not a toner. Coconut oil is not a moisturizer
4614 2018-03-16 21:05:53 Oh yeah. It sucks big time. Good thing there are no resource limits and oil lasts forever.
4615 2018-03-16 21:05:43 In a perfect world, they *might* work. We don't live in a perfect world, and replies to French's original tweets regarding GVRO's showed that.
4616 2018-03-16 21:05:36 Why y’all ain’t tell me carrot oil smelled this good??
4617 2018-03-16 21:05:24 Abeg make una forget all this one, let’s talk serious issues like can beans sellers sell beans without spilling oil on the side of the plate ??? #100nairanotes
4618 2018-03-16 21:05:12 The way you say oil is a very good term to put on a merch 
4619 2018-03-16 21:05:11 My car is clean inside and out and the oil is changed! I’ve been runnin the streets like crazy today! Not done either. I still need to get a few cold ones...  #weekendpreperations

4622 2018-03-16 21:04:44 Those of us living in W Lothian  & Lanarkshire know full well residents never personally gain from a shale oil rush !   It's taken 50 yrs to get rid of the evidence but hey our contribution to infrastructure in UK is priceless

4645 2018-03-16 21:01:38 There is a half decent conspiracy theory  that Russia b,ecause it derives so much revenue from oil, is heavily lobbying against green energy and the Republicans and Trump are getting money from them for that reason.

4666 2018-03-16 20:59:21 So I'm cooking in the kitchen and decide to use coconut oil. I look at the oils and see there are two different kinds; "extra virgin" and "pure". What's there a difference?
4667 2018-03-16 20:59:19 Let me get this straight... they made a coconut oil stick & put a white girl on the commercial?
4668 2018-03-16 20:59:02 @jjhorgan I'm with you all the way John.  This project does not help BC citizens - only Albertians.  Now even though crude oil is low the Alberta middleman are still charging us rediculous prices at the gas pump.  What are they going to charge afterwards?  What about spills?

4680 2018-03-16 20:56:53 Won't help. We have already greatly reduced our imports of oil due to increased production.  Trade balance even worse.

4686 2018-03-16 20:55:26 pathetic and corrupt 3rd world country that doesn't produce anything except gas and oil. Stop using Internet and social media, these things were invented in the States, you dummies.

3 days pass and then I’m over it and it gets dirty again.

4700 2018-03-16 20:53:22 My read of this is that a “new” cycle (or leg up in gold) started when the lines crossed/met in late 2015. Good support for those claiming gold is still in a secular bull market. Gold/oil ratio at ~21 today; Gold would have to hit ~$1900/oz to achieve a ratio of 30 at $62 WTI.

4721 2018-03-16 20:49:12 Oil revenue is part of total revenue, so it's perfectly normal to include it. UK was, and still is, heavily dependent on financial services, which brought UK to within 2 hours of a third bailout in 2008 and a deficit of £153bn (10.2% of GDP) in 2009-10. Should UK be self-ruled?

4739 2018-03-16 20:46:37 My mother is now googling for cannabis oil capsules..
4740 2018-03-16 20:46:36 And how does that compare to the Republican response? (i.e., leaving Paris Accords, mining in Arctic Refuge, destruction of Bears Ears, coastal offshore oil drilling, ending Clean Air and Clean Water standards, removing Endangered Species Act, silencing “Climate Change”)?
4741 2018-03-16 20:46:27 You want to plant on a brown site?

Also, what ya gonna do she, natural gas shoots back up?

Finally, those plastic and glass panels still require mining. Just remember that coal and oil are the most organic power sources we have.
4742 2018-03-16 20:46:24 I completely agree with medical cannabis. On a personal level, my mother has to take CBD oil due to epilepsy. She chose to do that rather than experimental and controversial drugs. Personally, I lean more towards the libertarian side of things, so I get your perspective.

4754 2018-03-16 20:44:23 I don't understand the argument that the pipeline will be used as long as it stands. The cost difference between shipping by pipeline and shipping by rail is something like $10/barrel. Not enough to sustain production if demand falls and the oil price drops.

4756 2018-03-16 20:44:18 during the referendum bt suggested it was folly to include oil in the mix

collapse of the oil price since has vindicated this position

it comes down to decision making skills

or the lack of them giving way to the mentality of a gambler

4774 2018-03-16 20:41:39 My argument is almost exactly the reverse. Trudeau and Notley are taking a compromise position: extend BC's policy nationwide, reducing fossil fuel demand by putting a rising price on CO2 emissions, while continuing to ship AB oil instead of leaving tens of billions on the table.

4895 2018-03-16 20:22:22 I still get my weekly hit or my skin plays up big time. Have loved the superfacialist oil cleanser for winter and use the @KiehlsUKI recovery oil once a week 
4896 2018-03-16 20:22:13 Again with that idiot.

He's not an expert. He's a snake oil salesman. He's Sean Hannity, Stefan Molyneux, Julian Assange, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones.

Please watch the video on my pinned tweet, I beg you.
4897 2018-03-16 20:22:08 I just spent the day with the Lipiodol guys and some other really important fertility experts. We presented the work to date which shows how good something as natural and risk free as poppy seed oil ( without the drugs man).. is at improving the chance of pregnancy when... (1/2)
4898 2018-03-16 20:22:04 US is going to let the Kurds camp on the rich oil reserve in Northern Syria... what dogs you are... Keep Turkey from getting it, by supplying arms to a mercenary army that is willing to defend it for USA...Uncle Sam what about Pres Assad?  Does Syria have say in on your decisions
4899 2018-03-16 20:21:40 In all honesty thought your oil disappeared until I watched you change it.

4904 2018-03-16 20:20:55 TIPS, Against Pepper Spray:

Use ANY “No Tears” Baby Shampoo to wash your face when you’re pepper sprayed.
Just like soap, it’ll help to remove the oil based pepper, and you can use it on sensitive areas like eyes to wash off the pepper, without causing more irritation.
4905 2018-03-16 20:20:46 IMF says Saudi needs $70/barrel in 2018.  Oilsands oil is profitable now at the discounted price that it sells for ($36.44 today).

4912 2018-03-16 20:20:15 (2) I also knew that texas pays more in federal taxes than any other states, yet receives nothing in return, due to its oil and balanced budget. it's not what you pay, it's what you get back, so the claim is stupid.
4913 2018-03-16 20:20:11 Sorry Guys, PM Trudeau doesn't really give a damn re: Canadian Oil Industry-even if it would cut down on huge "OIL SPILLS", our Royal Family is too busy "Vacationing" AGAIN & Justin loves counting the ARAB contributions to his Charity!!!
4914 2018-03-16 20:19:51 Serious question: do you use that kind of oil for dabs?  I accidentally bought one and my ex thought I was doing heroin. I usually just use wax or shatter.
4915 2018-03-16 20:19:49 Yeah it would be awesome if we just shut up about the oil money and the unfair spending and the lack of debates and the empty platform and just voted for whichever glossy caricature they told us to.  Right?  Keep those damaging opinions to ourselves...

4922 2018-03-16 20:18:33 This was an AP US Gov teacher. It's just natural that the kids in AP US Gov are going to care more about politics considering it's a relatively challenging course (supposedly, ez for me tho)  The NRA IS a powerful interest group so it isn't out of line to cover them that way

4926 2018-03-16 20:18:21 @Dabe lost two pounds since my first weighing on Wednesday and my ketone levels are up since I’ve been taking the oil you recommended. Half way through week two and feeling great about my progress already! Excited to keep going! Thanks for all your help, intronaut frond!!

4930 2018-03-16 20:17:57 @GordonRamsay How long should you heat up a cast iron skillet before putting oil/ a steak in, to make sure you get a restaurant quality dark crust? When I try with a normal pan, I struggle to get the initial dark colour, regardless of quantity of oil or temperature of the pan.
4931 2018-03-16 20:17:54 Buy an oil free moisturizer for face and use a mild soap. I used to be very oily too.

4962 2018-03-16 20:14:06 I used it a few yrs back, measuring oil production efficiency% - I think it worked quite well, in terms of visual effect. It does get used in other areas of reliability engineering (my area)
4963 2018-03-16 20:14:01 oh, I recommed trying some easy dishes first then, like, rolled omelette is also very easy :D (just have to beat the eggs, put some salt/spices into it and a bit of oil, then put it on a non-sticking pan thinly and roll it after a while), see, very easy :D
4964 2018-03-16 20:13:24 In pits..Every single coal mine was exactly the same, the coal was always nice height in identical seams, gas or water was always identical.
Or perhaps not.

And Pits just a few hundred yards apart had very different geologies,coal etc (therefore costs)..I imagine oil's the same?

4972 2018-03-16 20:11:59 Actually the pipeline has absolutely nothing to do with the safety of the coast.   Don’t get me wrong, I am in favour of this pipeline but tankers and their integrity is what ensures the safety of the coast.  The pipeline is definitely the safest way to get oil to those tankers.
4973 2018-03-16 20:11:44 Is @JoyAnnReid tired of talking about a false Russian-Collusion narrative?

4989 2018-03-16 20:09:46 None of this matters. As long as the oil & gas industry funds these campaigns, and the sheep continue to vote republican, this will be the reality. Soon, there won't be public education, only private schools for the wealthy. This is the plan.

5010 2018-03-16 20:07:00 I just want everyone here to know that this has been my favorite thread.
5011 2018-03-16 20:06:41 The answer in not even measurable. Oil and gas still receive way more funding. If you’re talking about the Libs renewables plan, that was more about making their friends rich then the technology used. This is the future and we’re falling behind.
5012 2018-03-16 20:06:32 The oil isn't in the water. 
Well it shouldn't be. 
5013 2018-03-16 20:06:14 It's a good combo of ag and oil, both of which we produce and others consume. Which does make SK look dirtier than it is, but at the same time, we're dragging our feet on any change.
5014 2018-03-16 20:06:13 Heater ran out of oil. Fuck.

5015 2018-03-16 20:06:09 Thank you for the great work,l! it is more than just really cool.  It will save lives & reduce oil demand which also work hand in hand.
5016 2018-03-16 20:06:07 Other then the liberals are easier to manipulate then conservatives, what other reasons do they have ? Foreign oil , globalism , population redistribution ? What could it be ? Is it even in Canada’s best interest ?
5017 2018-03-16 20:06:00 Agreed, yes it does, I prefer the robustness of bacon fat on denser fish and grape seed oil on milder flakier fish.
5018 2018-03-16 20:05:59 is it a rule in 2018 that when someone isn't following the basic logic of a discussion, they're the first ones to invoke the word "logic" lmao
5019 2018-03-16 20:05:42 How is buying oil from foreign countries better than buying from our own neighbours and allowing them to get product to market? Profits that can be redirected to better technologies verses sending Canadian money and oil profits to the middle east?
5020 2018-03-16 20:05:08 Tea break. I don’t want to work anymore today. Maybe I won’t. How will you afford your fancy olive oil then, Gerald? You’ll be down on the corner begging for the hard stuff.  “I need one more dollar for the Grade A Kalamata!”

(She filled the aromatherapy diffuser with essential oil, instead of floating a few drops on top of water - It was SO strong!)
5022 2018-03-16 20:04:53 Bloody idiot, talking about taxation. Just like mobile licences. Norway has an efficient star owned oil company and taxes the oil more, that's what I meant by harvesting
5023 2018-03-16 20:04:37 The oil industry (PDVSA) was the one who suffered the most because Chávez decided to fire over 20.000 professional workers and replace them with blind followers who knew nothing of oil refinery, making very common disasters like the Amuay explosions.
5024 2018-03-16 20:04:37 President Xi of China- We believe it will take $300 to $350 billion to rebuild Syria, I see a excellent chance for Chinese to get Syrian Oil as repayment. You know Syria needs money... And they deserve it... Open a line of credit with Syria... Money well invested...sir chew on it
5025 2018-03-16 20:04:07 Next task : oil change.
5026 2018-03-16 20:04:03 All they see is the shorter term money from oil and timber and other resources. We are cutting necessary programs left and right in order to appease oil companies.

5028 2018-03-16 20:03:39 Good they haven’t , because if they do; they would only put oil in fire
5029 2018-03-16 20:03:28 What a fuc$ing crock. He’s pro oil, pro-lining his pockets. Is he against solar because the entire administration is pro very alabaster skin?

5037 2018-03-16 20:01:50 War in Ukraine is German made with ex stasi active participation in Donbas. German partners acquire most of gazprom export - the way for Molotov/Ribbentrop pact remade to run the  EU;  oil/gas reserves in Ukraine are estimated at 100 bil barels and several trillion cubic meters
5038 2018-03-16 20:01:41 But a fairly transparent, binary offering Richard. Internet a whole lot worse if you consider for e.g. I, as a 40+ bloke in London, googling BP will get a different set of search results (share price etc) from a 20+ woman in Forida (oil spillages)
5039 2018-03-16 20:01:29 damn bro that shit looks bad u should check the oil maybe it needs a change too

5048 2018-03-16 20:00:51 The electricity became very cheap (subsidized by the oil) but, again, with no investment on it, more and more common became the shutdowns, with damaged many electrical products like TVs and PCs.
5049 2018-03-16 20:00:47 It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil.

5054 2018-03-16 20:00:23 that's because BC will be forced to buy WA state oil when Alberta cuts us off. At this point it is like Horgan is trying to secede from the federation

5080 2018-03-16 19:58:11 It’s nice an $80.00 car wash gets you a free oil change
5081 2018-03-16 19:57:54 Neither Iraq nor Syria have any relevance to keeping America safe. Troops are put in harm’s way for one reason: multinational corporations seeking global positioning for regional oil field thefts. We need to close all 800 foreign military bases and use that money at home.

5086 2018-03-16 19:57:27 Went in for an oil change and dealer asked if I had time for a car wash.

 Sure!

The car went from an even shade of dirt all over to large white spots all over.  

That didn't go the way I thought it would...
5087 2018-03-16 19:57:14 Want a huge discount on an oil change? NO PROBLEM! All you have to do is visit us today or tomorrow. THAT SIMPLE!
5088 2018-03-16 19:56:46 Getting my oil changed now because im a bad car owner and always wait till the last minute
5089 2018-03-16 19:56:41 fresh tuna steaks are also the jam (and easy). marinate for an hour in sesame oil + soy sauce + minced garlic + some pepper. sear on each side and serve with anything. delicious.

5092 2018-03-16 19:56:04 Fair question.
5093 2018-03-16 19:56:01 I've always had an interest in European culture. I also like how elegant some of the art is. A lot of old oil paintings are really pretty!;m; 
5094 2018-03-16 19:56:00 1st time cooking with coconut oil. Let's hope it comes out well.

5096 2018-03-16 19:55:44 on the last Friday of winter
I got a haircut and changed my car’s oil
in preparation for the changing of seasons.
5097 2018-03-16 19:55:43 I love the shop where I get my oil changed bc I go in on the two white guys who run the place. One is a Cubs fan and the other Cardinals fan- and I’m a Brewers fan. Tbh me and the Cubs fan have formed a low key alliance against the Cardinals fan out of principle 
5098 2018-03-16 19:55:26 Go-GURT is a more efficient fuel source than oil, but it's too tasty to waste.
5099 2018-03-16 19:55:25 So you call Bangladeshi uncivilized ? Indian are the most uncivilized people I've ever seen. Threw botols to the players or burn houses of the players when they loses. Oil your own machine first than come to teach others
5100 2018-03-16 19:55:11 When you go get an oil change, they waive the charge......but then tell say you need new tires and a battery ($700 later)
5101 2018-03-16 19:55:10 Murphy speaks the truth, we all listen but it doesn't matter, the spineless pm we have hasn't got a clue on the economy. If it weren't for the oil industry Canada would not be where it is at today, the world laughs as we cancel pipelines and they keep chugging away

5103 2018-03-16 19:55:08 Ich verstehe auch nicht, warum man dieses ganze synthetische Zeug braucht, das jetzt überall angeboten wird. Mit Oil of Rohloff bin ich super zufrieden und glaube kaum, dass es chemisch besser läuft.

5109 2018-03-16 19:54:30 Only I could splash hot oil over myself and only burn my fingertip  actually so inconvenient
5110 2018-03-16 19:54:29 ..it's shocking right enough Emma but there's thousands dying in Yemen where it's getting bombed back to the Stone Age and our government and USA govt are complicit. Again the presence of oil always makes me suspicious.
5111 2018-03-16 19:54:28 If the rumours are true, the pool at the hotel where City are staying is filled with oil.  #oilcnuts
5112 2018-03-16 19:54:14 I'm really disappointed that so many of Flying Tiger's food products have palm oil in them

5119 2018-03-16 19:53:16 Seems to be really really dark rye bread cut into soldiers, dried out, rubbed in pure garlic and fried in oil. Unreal beer food!
5120 2018-03-16 19:53:13 It should. Mahi-mahi to can hold up to barbecuing. 

West Africans also make a delicious dish out of black-eyed peas and plantain, often using tuna, called red-red. The issue there is the use of artery-clogging palm oil. Interested if there is a satisfactory work-around.
5121 2018-03-16 19:53:09 I sautee it with olive oil and garlic...very good..makes ur pee smell tho
5122 2018-03-16 19:52:50 And what is that supposed to show? The UK has under-harvested it's resources. While Norway gets 20 bn a year in revenues for similar turnover, even at its height the UK let all the profit go to private companies. And it shows that most of UK oil tax is actually scottish

5127 2018-03-16 19:52:19 In terms of economy, the regime (since 2002) started to nationalize the land and companies (including internet, water, gas, oil and electricity) which started to reduce our national productivity. This was covered through importations but that's no longer possible.

5139 2018-03-16 19:50:45 Wonder how much money s been forked into refineries and oil platforms. The option to not invest is to spend on building walls to prevent sea rise. Unless it’s too late..
5140 2018-03-16 19:50:32 That's just nutrition, this isn't wars over resources like food, water or oil. And it's specifically 5 and under.
5141 2018-03-16 19:50:11 Tiger balm the red strength formula-works like an anti-venom (bought at walmart walgreens, cvs etc). It is the cajuput oil that even in India is used against a snake bite. It really works.
5142 2018-03-16 19:50:11 We don't have enough? May be misreading. Didn't like him in beginning, oil man. But anyone who calls potus an effin moron is ok by me.
5143 2018-03-16 19:50:09 He used lies & inflation of his wealth to impress gullible people that he’s rich  & will make them successful too! Unfortunately it’s all smoke & mirrors he’s a liar! a snake oil salesman! He’s goal is to enrich himself & his cronies! He is using taxpayers money to live lavishly!

5145 2018-03-16 19:50:01 Well, there are looming bullish catalysts (Iran, Venezuela, MBS meeting, Trump) that could come very soon that will send the price of oil flying;  it seems unlikely to me that oil drops to $55 as the more difficult months [should] be behind us. I've been wrong before.

5149 2018-03-16 19:49:32 That doesn't answer the question. So what if Norway managed to do it? That doesn't mean we'd have been able to do it. There's more than just the raw cost/profit of oil to consider you know.

5159 2018-03-16 19:47:35 What a banner few days for the Washington State economy. First you give the Seattle tourism industry a gift with the cancelation of the World Cup and now you promote their oil industry at the expense of the Canadian economy. Brilliant. You’re the mark.
5160 2018-03-16 19:46:58 I use caster oil and shea moisture curling cream. I mix olive and caster oil in my spray bottle and spray my hair once a day when I take my wigs off
5161 2018-03-16 19:46:54 That show is just plain stupid.
5162 2018-03-16 19:46:38 Yes lol they do a tire rotation, they change the filter, oil change and a car wash and a regular car inspection
5163 2018-03-16 19:46:19 Nothing like a good ol beard wash and oil

5166 2018-03-16 19:46:09 @AliVelshi Every time they mention the goods trade deficit with Canada, you should remind them that Canada ships $54 billion in oil and natural gas to the US - there's a huge US surplus in manufactured products.

5170 2018-03-16 19:45:34 Do I nap today, and then get an oil change before I leave for Phoenix 

Or should I get an oil change today and then go to a party tired as fuck? Decisions
5171 2018-03-16 19:45:32 I had to chop mine off cause it was so ugly. I’ve been putting oil on my ends. Idk if it’s working lol.

5178 2018-03-16 19:44:45 As I said it is interesting read many things in #breastpain we don’t understand here is the uk we advice to use evening primrose oil or star flower oil, elsewhere in Europe they have progesterone creams and other things not available here this variation tells us we don’t know
5179 2018-03-16 19:44:22 Yes, but megalomaniacs never think that way. Germany had its own resources to grow out of Wiemar economy, Japan had to invade Korea, China, and SE Asia to get theirs. Iran lacks everything but oil???? Would have to invade to acquire more.

5188 2018-03-16 19:42:55 @AnnaVocino got a recipe for mayo made with olive oil?
5189 2018-03-16 19:42:52 Does this take into the account the impact of the whole barrel of crude oil from where the LDPE originated, or just the LDPE fraction?
5190 2018-03-16 19:42:19 Alot of golden tickets out there if you can hold for 12-24 months, the longer the most likely higher side of reward.  Personally, I am playing small and mid caps as they get better torque (albeit, more risk if you're bearish) with names that have strong leverage to oil prices.
5191 2018-03-16 19:42:17 Apparently if you lightly fry it in coconut oil it will slide into the bin that much easier!

5222 2018-03-16 19:39:05 Rethinkx and International Energy Agency both published reports on the impact that EV's will have on crude. Even if we ignore the artificial price of oil as it stands it's important to note that a reduction in oil demand will strand the oils sands
5223 2018-03-16 19:39:03 yes that would be The Absolute Tits that is exactly what I fk w/, that is exactly what we want, that is exactly what we need, this is the solution to the oil crisis, this is the solution to world hunger, this is the solution to y=mx+b, this is yes.

5235 2018-03-16 19:37:54 Great article. As a past oil industry employee who went through several oil busts, including the 80s, cuts were often directed at those making the highest income. In most cases, that was men. I went from full-time to part-time contract work. Industry corrections were over-due.
5236 2018-03-16 19:37:53 Thanks to all involved dealing with the chaos caused from the large oil spillage this afternoon, inc @HautesCapelles staff staying behind until parents/carers could get to school. @GuernseyPolice unravelling the traffic jam!  @StatesWorks always there ready to help.Well done all
5237 2018-03-16 19:37:32 today i woke up in tears via a nightmare, burned the absolute shit out of my arm with olive oil, ate a slice of bread before realizing it was moldy, and walked into an enourmous spiderweb that had me covered in eight legged freaks. i just wanted to say thanks.

5247 2018-03-16 19:35:40 In addition, why is the Secretary more driven to pursue oil and gas projects over mega renewable energy projects? The technology is there. It's far cleaner overall.

This is a bit lopsided.
5248 2018-03-16 19:35:39 Nah. I was busy not being Mad Online
5249 2018-03-16 19:35:34 Better put some oil in that hair with that humidity

5273 2018-03-16 19:33:06 So you dont want environmental scientists shaping environmental policy, @EPAScottPruitt? Oh let me guess!

5274 2018-03-16 19:33:02 You mean optimal tax? How is this different from a massive oil find making whale hunters lose their jobs?
5275 2018-03-16 19:33:00 We've been hearing from heavy oil exporters about "hungry Asian markets" for years.

Meanwhile Canada's heavy oil exports to Asia have tapered off to zero.

Why? Because shippers get a better price at refineries in Washington and California.

#KinderMorgan is a U.S. pipeline.

5277 2018-03-16 19:32:59 hell yeah and girl I put coconut oil in my hair and on my eyelashes every night before bed, it makes em grow faster
5278 2018-03-16 19:32:55 I slept with so much coconut oil in my hair last night. Is this even gonna do anything? I’m over here making fun of Jimin’s crispy ass hair when mine is just as dry
5279 2018-03-16 19:32:14 I wasn’t on this thread to address anything political - just calling out a pig that you felt the need to defend
5280 2018-03-16 19:32:12 Out of curiosity, if what you want to bet on is the price of oil, why use these small brittle companies as a derivative? Why not just directly buy options on oil and roll them over or whatever?
5281 2018-03-16 19:32:03 Just like they did for cigarettes just like you're trying to do for guns only it's not going to work. Because you can't conflate subjects. You do but it doesn't work it just makes people look you but it doesn't work it just makes people look dumb. Like mixing oil and water
5282 2018-03-16 19:31:59 Took my brand new car to get an oil change at the closest place by my house and now I have to get it TOWED to the dealership bc of some defective part ???? Lmfao why does this shit happen to me
5283 2018-03-16 19:31:49 Oh no! CBD hemp oil is supposed to be really helpful for that. I'm not sure if that's an option that's available to you, but I've heard it helps.
5284 2018-03-16 19:31:45 The oil, LNG & coal companies of The Earth have been defined, like the sugar water companies & the automebile companies as rackets.  All scientists & engineers associated with these groups commits fraud, if by no other means than not turning the selves there of in for child abuse
5285 2018-03-16 19:31:44 Anyone know any good cbd oil companies that actually work???
5286 2018-03-16 19:31:42 Coconut oil make my hair frizzy

5288 2018-03-16 19:31:33 According to Trump, we should have taken the oil with us when leaving Iraq. Sure. Using a giant straw, no doubt. #StupidTrump
5289 2018-03-16 19:31:25 Is it oil or matte vernish?
5290 2018-03-16 19:31:25 Castor oil
5291 2018-03-16 19:31:18 The companies you mention are only diversifying into those renewables in jurisdictions where they can receive massive subsidies. That tells you that they will do whatever wherever they can make $$. Doesn’t mean they think oil is dying.
5292 2018-03-16 19:31:05 Water & oil don’t mix
5293 2018-03-16 19:31:05 So where do I get this CBD oil? And is it good for pain and insomnia? I want to try it!
5294 2018-03-16 19:30:56 Yes! It’s a highly diluted essential oil blend for her sinuses. It smells minty.
5295 2018-03-16 19:30:49 Guessing oil spills have killed more birds than wind turbines ever will, and birds killed by oil spills suffer as they die. #Trump hires the best douchebags.

5303 2018-03-16 19:30:05 $WTI sigue firme 62.20/62.50 bien el articulo del salmonido papel comentando que Merval se partiria porque tenemos muchas petroleras hace unas ruedas...no paro el rebote. Si se parte no es por el OIL ...
5304 2018-03-16 19:29:58 I wonder if coconut oil would make fries "healthier" 
5305 2018-03-16 19:29:49 Fabulous. My kids had pizza there, with their uncle, every Friday. Proper pizza oven, could taste the olive oil in the base.

5307 2018-03-16 19:29:42 It broke my heart yesterday when my husband’s endo told him to cut down on fat and that he should be using margarine and Mazola oil.   We hate firing people, but this particular business IS personal. Thank you for what you do.
5308 2018-03-16 19:29:19 I mean Pep only managed Barca whilst they were already winning CL’s, Bayern just after a treble and then goes to oil rich City. When he’s gone and built a team like Liverpool or Spurs on a smaller budget then I’ll call him a ‘revolutionist’

5312 2018-03-16 19:28:45 I wish I had the skills to be a mechanic. I was getting my oil changed I looked up at this sign that said they get paid $120 an hour like bro & 160 if they start on it and finish it.
5313 2018-03-16 19:28:43 He needs a female mechanic who can change his hair oil every 3000 fcuk-ups.
5314 2018-03-16 19:28:34 I am wearing eyeshadow that's the exact same colour as my face oil god bless i'll be here all week.
5315 2018-03-16 19:28:32 Not like we can switch providers. For most of us Western Ky Rural Electric is the single choice. Sign up with them or get the oil lamps out!

5318 2018-03-16 19:28:16 @bcalmanac progressives of any stripe are not waiting for Feds #climatechange the walth myth is broken & ppl r shifting. Even @cathmckenna knows this if few others don’t. Even oil reality is a 25 yr window.?
5319 2018-03-16 19:28:01 At this point I think you realize that your message leaks oil. You're giving arbitrary preference to one form of personal identity, knowing that there are other factors with just as much influence, to justify your White Savior complex.
5320 2018-03-16 19:28:00 Lemme get this oil change and tire rotation before I head out to Savannah tonight.
5321 2018-03-16 19:27:57 Still in shock about Aubrey.  But massive amounts of debt and being at the mercy of oil price! .... isnt that investing 101? guess not.
5322 2018-03-16 19:27:56 @afneil not the most frightening country. Built his economy on two things he can't control, price of Oil & Gas.
5323 2018-03-16 19:27:53 I’m still compiling some data so I can’t drink just yet. Dude, 300k+ oil wells... 
5324 2018-03-16 19:27:49 unlike those oil fields, offshore drilling platforms, oil tankers, pipelines, refineries and combustion engines - those are all sparkly clean magical fairy technologies that ALSO reverse balding and smooth out wrinkles! 
5325 2018-03-16 19:27:38 Use oil paint instead then.
5326 2018-03-16 19:27:33 You are so typical of rich Westerners who think a country's wealth just materialised from thin air. China unlike US did not got rich with the 'benefits' of few Europeans overtaking an entire continent with massive natural resources, plus slave labours and cheap oil.
5327 2018-03-16 19:27:31 I think the sanctions were a blessing in disguise, allowing the imposition of a degree of autarchy that has kick-started a moribund economy that had relied overmuch on gas and oil sales.
5328 2018-03-16 19:27:22 Ek oil! 
5329 2018-03-16 19:27:10 There’s a lady here tweeting about Lolu being the worst cook on #BBNaija, Lmao ,f**king hypocrite wore a full apron and chef hat to prepare watery noodles last week and a pot of palm oil she called Egusi soup.
5330 2018-03-16 19:27:06 "Western intelligence officials said that they can track the ISIS oil shipments as they move into Turkey’s southern border regions. The Obama admin. was struggling to cut off the millions of dollars in oil revenue that has made the ISIS, but they were unable to persuade Turkey"

5333 2018-03-16 19:26:55 Thankfully not played at my car dealership was there yesterday for an oil change and I already had read prior tweets on Faux in Dr offices etc. They had one TV on HGTV other on DIY guess they want customers thinking about houses not their cars
5334 2018-03-16 19:26:50 when someone comes into mac grill to eat and tells me they’re allergic to olive oil? like ok???? you literally can only eat the bread????? LOL
5335 2018-03-16 19:26:49 I have worked in the oil patch business my whole life. So I know the issues very well. It is refined fuels we have to import. The Redwater Partnership is undergoing completion. Isn't it going to be handy for us in Alberta? Just saying...
5336 2018-03-16 19:26:48 Yeah.  For Zinke, that answer is entirely up to the oil companies.
5337 2018-03-16 19:26:44 You put actual oil in the batter? That might help, and letting them cook longer.  But tbh I'm sure now that I think of it that the problem is I stubbornly cook everything I eat in a 35 year old cast iron skillet which probably isn't the right surface (ok for pancakes though).
5338 2018-03-16 19:26:30 Ho humm...it seems it's OK for foreign money if you are a multinational oil company or some other big business....
5339 2018-03-16 19:26:13 The USA loves Horgan because he is making them billions on their oil exports! Horgan is a traitor to Canada  and British Columbia!
5340 2018-03-16 19:26:11 Barry Hinson is a snake oil salesman. He makes yearly mediocre performances seem like Herculean efforts. He could beat Rend Lake and spin it like he just won at Duke.
5341 2018-03-16 19:26:11 Needs to be a meme made of him with an oil slick on his head or something similar
5342 2018-03-16 19:25:57 Oil prices jumped on Friday despite an increase in the rig count, rising U.S. production and a subdued decline in oil inventories.
5343 2018-03-16 19:25:42 Guys, my car is leaking a small bit of oil and now government agents are pursuing me. Please help.
5344 2018-03-16 19:25:42 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
5345 2018-03-16 19:25:41 My legs need that good coconut oil rub down 
5346 2018-03-16 19:25:35 Please stop wasting people's time and money and do serious research on Cannabis Oil and Plant Based medicines. There are already cures for cancer but charities like yourselves and the pharmaceutical companies don't want people to know so you can continue profiting from the sick.
5347 2018-03-16 19:25:35 I will be getting a new sunscreen but this one does the job fine for now, the oil cleanser i only use at night and the physical exfoliator i use on my body every other day, and on my face like once every 2 weeks.
5348 2018-03-16 19:25:34 Okay I used oil based paint but it took about 2 days to dry completely. And I also repainted it and used acrylic paint and it only took a night to dry :)
5349 2018-03-16 19:25:31 Theyll collect it all and produce more oil with it?
5350 2018-03-16 19:24:56 @CertasBusiness You need to sort your website! Have had to order oil and pay as cannot use our money in credit, then claim a refund! #crazy!

5352 2018-03-16 19:24:52 threatening people with information that might be useful to them, it's an interesting concept

irrelevant who predicted an oil boom, all kinds of predictions are made all the time but using oil price forecasts to buoy a campaign for constitutional change is ludicrous

5361 2018-03-16 19:23:32 These Bond villains’ origin story: Father Fred Trump’s wealth from oil refineries in Hitler’s Germany; harsh upbringing by governesses & military schools; betrayals & lawsuits among the siblings; radical libertarian thirst for tax cuts, envt destruction & denial of worker rights.
5362 2018-03-16 19:23:26 Put olive oil on them at night it made mine grow out thicker and quick !
5363 2018-03-16 19:23:22 Looking greatt!! have you heard of Argan Oil ?
5364 2018-03-16 19:23:12 I did a stint as a vegan since lactose hurts. But real cheese is sadly the only thing that tastes like cheese. Daiya isnt bad if you melt it, add salt, add some basil, add some coconut oil, and then use it as a spread
5365 2018-03-16 19:23:06 Boo Back....Today  The good   I got like half a cup of lentils and throw in a pot with water(1 1/2...maybe 2) for like 10 minutes than add Half a potato carrots and what ever else.The bad I make french fries with the other other 1/2 of potato in olive oil.The ugly...None here

5370 2018-03-16 19:22:42 John, neither of our names are Katie Rich. I’m talking about this particular tweet about those particular girls. We all have sins from our past & I don’t go out making jokes about Barron, who’s a child. Politics aside I troll the trolls who troll the untrollworthy.
5371 2018-03-16 19:22:30 ten's ejaculate feel like boiling oil when it lands on you
5372 2018-03-16 19:22:28 I sold apartment buildings, oil properties, re-development projects and office towers. I wouldn’t waste my time with some piddly ass house. 
5373 2018-03-16 19:22:00 Yea, I reported her to her employer for that.  Did you?
5374 2018-03-16 19:21:57 No one is feasting in hotels. There are services available for all veterans. AGAIN, oil and gas is a boom/bust industry and everyone in AB knows it. If you want job security do not go into oil and gas. Its that simple. FYI we imported just as much oil under harper so be honest.

(AB emissions increased 18% over same time but population grew faster.)

5390 2018-03-16 19:19:57 1st season at united, José wins 2 trophies. 1st season at city, pep spends quarter billion and just scrapes top 4. Yet pep's a genius while José is criticised? José has a right to have a pop at media! There's more to football than oil funded city
5391 2018-03-16 19:19:52 You're misunderstanding this event. It's about oil companies giving money to politicians. Psycho elites? What is that? War? Propaganda?  Racism? Not a part of this. It's like you'll grab anything negative about the US and call it proof of wanting us to own the world.
5392 2018-03-16 19:19:49 but I make sure to put chill oil on it!!! all these ingredients together are buff but honestly I’m taking the piss, chicken comes 1st but tuna is deffo second

5398 2018-03-16 19:19:22 Is it really the Oil companies or is it our local and federal government?  The energy business and capital investment is going extremely well south of the border.  Things are even going better in Sask?  Why not in Alberta?  I think your missing the root cause.
5399 2018-03-16 19:19:03 I use 3 cups of flour when I make dough and increased the water from 1C to 1.25C and the oil from 2 tbs to 3tbs with good effect.

5406 2018-03-16 19:18:25 You're taking it out of context. Some people in the SNP believe that he should've treated oil revenues as a bonus when considering total revenue generation.
5407 2018-03-16 19:17:55 CHK, that’s another interesting one… After reading ‘Frackers’ it was clear to me that this is a terrible business. You can, against all odds and through sheer grit, discover massive amounts of oil and gas and still constantly be on the verge of going broke.

5419 2018-03-16 19:15:36 There are good ones you can go out and buy but you can make your own by just taking some corn starch in a little bowl, sprinkle in a little baking soda, add a few drops of your favorite Essential Oil
5420 2018-03-16 19:15:27 He is an absolute first class cockwomble....#anythingforattention  he encourages women to rub oil all over him then moans when they touch him wtf 
5421 2018-03-16 19:15:04 that makes them more slippery from the get-go, but i also oil the pan between each crepe. Also, assuming they are thin, you don't start trying to move them until the entire TOP is no longer wet. Then, depending on your pan tbh, you can either try to jiggle them loose, or like me,
5422 2018-03-16 19:15:04 I can’t wait to watch it. Last week’s made me want to never touch oil again.
5423 2018-03-16 19:14:58 day 2 of grapeseed oil >
5424 2018-03-16 19:14:51 I would average how many more fills ups I’d have, oil changes, maintenance, etc. if it equals out, then naw. If you’re still going to pocket substantially more money, do it!
5425 2018-03-16 19:14:48 I’ve been drinking used car oil so this is great news
5426 2018-03-16 19:14:22 Lol, blanket statements. Such intran3tz tuff guy who posts on UK white nationalist and lead tainted snake oil sales man twatter.
5427 2018-03-16 19:14:15 Yes we would need him with oil money too.

5429 2018-03-16 19:13:31 So of course it seems I am allergic to coconut oil.
5430 2018-03-16 19:13:31 Eco Styler’s coconut oil gel doesn’t hold my hair down for shit 
5431 2018-03-16 19:13:30 No I don’t want a new motor in my truck, I’m just here for an oil change man.
5432 2018-03-16 19:13:25 Haha i get that, but my people willing to make pancakes for me are too far so I've been forced into self-sufficiency :) i recently watched some french guy in the 60s make crepes and it was wild, he put in a litre of beer etc, but one thing i liked was that he put a bit of oil in,
5433 2018-03-16 19:13:00 Wal-Mart can be stacked to roof with cheap goods. Other countries dumping cheap goods does you no good if you don't have a job.
5434 2018-03-16 19:12:58 Day one was horrible I never wanna see lemons or olive oil again

5438 2018-03-16 19:12:31 It’s so weird that anyone sticks up for a man who talks shit about little girls so I will stay up here on my high judgmental horse. 
5439 2018-03-16 19:12:28 Got my toes did , 2 tires replaced and now I'm getting an oil change  very eventful morning
5440 2018-03-16 19:12:00 BNN guest Martin Pelletier is delusional. Texas is a hot-bed of activity because it's SHALE, not bitumen. In a world awash in oil, who wants to invest in bitumen (big protects, long lead times...). #cdnpoli
5441 2018-03-16 19:11:56 if i referenced yall to my favorite essential oil company would you buy from them (if it also supports and gives me income as well)? 

serious question
5442 2018-03-16 19:11:51 Cool, thank you. I know I was a troll & it was in jest, but I think this tiff further proves that the opposing sides are actually more aligned on this issue than most think. I can also agree that those signs were divisive but my heart goes out to making fun of middle schoolers.
5443 2018-03-16 19:11:49 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5444 2018-03-16 19:11:37 If BC would put the pipeline in we could use more AB oil at a cheaper price instead of floating US tanker oil up the coast at a much higher cost.
5445 2018-03-16 19:11:25 Oil
5446 2018-03-16 19:11:10 "Old Engine Oil porter", matured in Highland Park casks, 8%. That frankly sounds amazing. 
5447 2018-03-16 19:11:03 Also of note is increased HDL with coconut oil.
5448 2018-03-16 19:11:01 Free trade was 2,800 pages of an agreement locked in a secure room under armed guard? 
TPP.
I sell you a burrito, you sell me a hamburger?
5449 2018-03-16 19:10:58 Can someone take my car to get an oil change so I can sit in bed?
5450 2018-03-16 19:10:54 The old pipeline has been in existence since 1953. The proposed pipeline triples the amount to 890,000 barrels a day. Why not require a spill fund equal to the cost savings over transporting the oil by rail? They’re going to take it out of the ground anyway.
5451 2018-03-16 19:10:50 I really have been putting coconut oil on my face 2 times everyday for like 2 months.
5452 2018-03-16 19:10:40 I’d hate to get oil all over my good firefighter outfit tho.

5455 2018-03-16 19:09:58 Drinking palm oil like champagne, from the bottle. My enemies can’t win se
5456 2018-03-16 19:09:49 Same thing with fuel importation. Oil marketers stand to gain a lot from it, that's why they don't want refineries built.
5457 2018-03-16 19:09:36 Haven’t use oil to cook in so long
5458 2018-03-16 19:09:12 Does it say that my dick is bigger than his, John? That’s what I was hoping people would think.
5459 2018-03-16 19:09:01 I adulted today and I didn’t even have to leave my bed. Made an appointment for an oil change for Monday

5464 2018-03-16 19:08:43 All are welcome at the Crown Oil Arena. Nice little bar and food available.
5465 2018-03-16 19:08:22 The Oil & Gas media (@aljazeera & @AlArabiya) are parroting corporate-funded @CNN's anti-#Russia propaganda. They do an excellent job translating American rhetoric & propaganda into Arabic.
5466 2018-03-16 19:08:20 I swear Honda oil changes take thee longest....
5467 2018-03-16 19:08:02 You’re right about the high horse mentality but I actually do not believe all men who own guns have tiny penises. I’m very cool with gun ownership. Just wanted to troll a troll for trolling young girls.
5468 2018-03-16 19:07:49 yo olive oil with tea tree oil fucking works holy shit
5469 2018-03-16 19:07:48 RIP. #American presence in the Middle East is a win-win for both local people and Americans. Without Americans, all minorities like #Christians , #Yezidis , #Kurds would have been wiped out. In return for providing security, I dont mind them taking oil
5470 2018-03-16 19:07:45 Not sure which is worse: #DotardDonnieJr's hair in the photo, or his hair now. It looks like he starts his day by dunking his head in an oil barrel.
5471 2018-03-16 19:07:21 Gotta love the vol collapse we have had. Oil has been good to us right?! I still have a /ZS position on that I put on a few days ago, but it too has really come in.. Wish we could clean up in Nat gas like before, but little IV premium to sell. Still looking..

5478 2018-03-16 19:05:47 Serious question- do u think that there needs to be more gun regulation in the US, or do u think how things r now is OK? Or do u believe we currently have adequate restrictions but need better enforcement? I’m being serious & would appreciate ur perspective.
5479 2018-03-16 19:05:41 Sorry to hear about your skin cancer Susan, that's awful. I'm lucky because I'm a sun worshipper , and from the age of 17 only ever used a factor 2 oil,  now I'm more sensible and use a higher factor, but never burnt as I'm olive skinned.
5480 2018-03-16 19:05:33 Currently in an oil diffuser shop
5481 2018-03-16 19:05:28 Such is the life in the oil and gas industry. Anyone from AB has known that their entire lives. If your family isn't standing by you or you haven't figured out there is no job security in a particular industry you move on. Has nothing to do with any refugee.
5482 2018-03-16 19:05:15 Yeah, #NotAllMaleGunOwners but you were still the first in this thread to bring up someone's genitals. It says more about you than your intended target.
5483 2018-03-16 19:04:54 Damn near got my hand smashed with my truck’s hood all bc I was checking my oil. 

The hood hit my hand but i moved it before it coukd get smached in between tho.  That shit still hurt too 
5484 2018-03-16 19:04:49 Orange I say!  Orange!  Ginger I say!  Ginger!  You have a pain?  Rub on orange or ginger 100% essential oil and wait for just a little while.  Amazing stuff!    How did I not always know they existed and worked?  And I don't even work for them.
5485 2018-03-16 19:04:43 Got blocked again by a beautiful cheerleader . Wasn’t trying to be offensive when asking if they needed an oil boy.. ya know the ending of dumb and dumber..?
5486 2018-03-16 19:04:37 Playing with the iPhone X while I get an oil change is making me want one

5490 2018-03-16 19:03:52 Distilled White Vinegar is a deodorizer. You could dilute it, spray it and then mop it up with clean water and dry it with a rag. It’s a lot of work but I know that works. I put little bit of lavender essential oil to make it not so strong smelling.
5491 2018-03-16 19:03:42 @SBakerMD Question on steak preparation. I like to prepare mine with salt & pepper before I grill, and butter, Italian seasoning, paprika, a little garlic, and mayyybe a little onion/onion powder and a dash of chili powder during/after. Thoughts? Do you use any spices/butter/oil?
5492 2018-03-16 19:03:39 وواضح حمااسسسكم 
5493 2018-03-16 19:03:35 I think it's safe to assume, first, that the former CEO of WWF Canada, PM Butts, is unwilling to support Canadian oil workers. Second, it's clear that the PM has an aversion to associating himself with anything that isn't popular. Either way, it's the same ole Western alienation.
5494 2018-03-16 19:03:32 "you might end up sending a check to Big Oil for services rendered..." Do you actually have any credible study that finds net +ve benefits of climate change? Or are you just making that up? Plenty of studies show net -ve.
5495 2018-03-16 19:03:21 Sardines/ fish oil
5496 2018-03-16 19:03:16 I’m excited because it’ll be a nice change from the infinity war for oil I’ve been watching my whole life.
5497 2018-03-16 19:03:06 Ryan Zinke is really only interested in one bird; The one on dollar bills symbolizing the money he’s going to get from oil and gas and has received in the past from oil and gas interests.
5498 2018-03-16 19:02:59 Wooiii, pole Sana. Get some tea tree oil...its very effective....plus other series of benefits. Use few drops (like 3/4 drops at most) in hot water placed in a bowl, cover your head with towel and inhale the steam...
5499 2018-03-16 19:02:58 Yeah Tanning only helps if they aren’t as dark or whatever but bio oil helps to even out skin tone. I mean I have pretty deep ones on the side of my butt which I was always self conscious about but we should learn to love them anyways lol

CSKA is owned by Yuri Sechin of Rosneft (Russia's No. 1 oil exporter), a friend of Putin. The OAR roster was 60% SKA, 32% CSKA

5509 2018-03-16 19:01:10 We are resource rich! With all the restrictions we were allowed to farm it. We have so much natural gas on the Rockies, all the coal a country could want oil is everywhere but no fracking, no oil pipelines can't burn coal so much fresh water also
5510 2018-03-16 19:01:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet however many there may be.
5511 2018-03-16 19:01:04 LOL!  As a Scot I SHOULD object, but sadly I can acknowledge our cuisine is very meat-heavy.  Have you tried potato scones?  As long as they're cooked in vegetable oil they're vegan.

5522 2018-03-16 19:00:02 Crude oil has wound itself into an ever-tighter trading range – we look at what may be next:
5523 2018-03-16 19:00:00 Bruscetta;
Tomato, basil, olive oil and garlic, grilled ciabatta
5524 2018-03-16 18:59:53 Tbh I'd much prefer to smoke before taking my oil. Shut down the flip out (I have DID too) and then let the oil work. And therapy. You're so right about having a poc to help. I could never be totally honest with a person with so few shared xp's. Thank you for what you're doing
5525 2018-03-16 18:59:44 I spent all my money on designer clothes now I can’t get an oil change 
5526 2018-03-16 18:59:36 Anyways I learned something that I think is Important for you to know. If you look on your food label It includes any "hydrogenated" type of oil, DONT EAT IT. It's terrible for you. Palm oil is no better! Please look for alternatives, your arteries deserve better.
5527 2018-03-16 18:59:23 The company who produce the creams (schlagfix) have a faq section on their website about sustainable palm oil and their responsibilities. Hope this helps.

5542 2018-03-16 18:57:24 I've noticed that you're not exactly on a real man trajectory. 

Real men can disagree with others without the need to insult. Insults are just a sign of a lack of anything else to say that's actually relevant.

5567 2018-03-16 18:53:36 Agree.  CPCs too cozy w big oil so huge resistance to paradigm shift. Harper had no vision, putting us behind the 8 ball. With Trump, we've a great opportunity to lead NA in renewable energy. Trudeau's a visionary, on the right side of science and brave enough to leap.

5572 2018-03-16 18:53:19 I don’t think that oil really works. My gma has a million of those bottles.
5573 2018-03-16 18:53:19 That would explain why there's an oil man in charge of EPA, a private school promoter in charge of teh Dept of Education, and so on...

-We didn’t kill 1 million, that figure refers to the Al-Qaeda insurgency. Civilian casualties from our invasion were a fraction of that.
-It was US intelligence from Iraqi oppostion sources.
5577 2018-03-16 18:52:41 Are we still discussing about oil

Dear Friends,

In January, the Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, made an announcement in Tallahassee, saying Florida was "off the table" for oil drilling, after releasing a plan that opened up all U.S…

5587 2018-03-16 18:51:39 Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018, an analyst who correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's rally at the start of last year told CNBC... let's use Bitcoin to pay for all that oil
5588 2018-03-16 18:51:39 There’s literally enough oil on the planet to power us at our current usage for thousands of years. The supply isn’t dwindling any time soon. Needs to be a solution that makes sense economically as well as environmentally to start seeing ubiquitous switch over.
5589 2018-03-16 18:51:35 ปวดหัวง่าาา
5590 2018-03-16 18:51:25 Mr Kenny: How bout introducing a motion to pass Legislation limiting the volume of Oil & Gas in the existing pipeline to the Vancouver Area. It’s Legal ! They get 90 ‘/, Oil & Gas from Alberta. See what the NDP do. Would they do that to their NDP bedfellows in British Columbia
5591 2018-03-16 18:51:21 This is most likely the oil terminal just across the river from Oak Point, WA. 50 miles N of Portland near Rainier.

5606 2018-03-16 18:49:27 Coconut oil and eggs have stopped and reduced the symptoms of dementia. I have been taking care of my neighbor with dementia and he won't go a day without it. search it. Its all over the Internet. I watched it work. he also takes vitamin D fish oil and a prenatal vitamin

5609 2018-03-16 18:49:05 Sell your snake oil to the weak minded. Those countries still deal with mass violence. Guns and the #2A are not the problem. In fact trying to take them from law abiding citizens will cause a severe escalation in violence not seen since the American revolution.
5610 2018-03-16 18:48:59 So I’m getting my car worked on and apparently they don’t have synthetic oil for high mileage so uh I hope whatever oil they use won’t fuck up my car
5611 2018-03-16 18:48:58 abalone or oil slick
5612 2018-03-16 18:48:57 I wash mine every week and I use the line of shea moisturizer. I moisturize it every two days. With wild growth oil and she moisture curl enhancer
5613 2018-03-16 18:48:50 Don't tel WM we have all this oil, they'll never let us go.
5614 2018-03-16 18:48:42 Have you tried a drive thru oil change place? Theyre a bit more expensive but you dont even get out of the car
5615 2018-03-16 18:48:38 Putting coconut oil on my hair as soon as I got home so no one can corrupt me to go out was the best idea everrrrr

 I don't think the majority are celebrating that Juice is having surgery, it has more to do with him no longer being on the ice, being the defensive liability that he is.
5620 2018-03-16 18:48:33 could you add some cheese please with a smear of oil
5621 2018-03-16 18:48:17 Jojoba oil + Rose hip seed oil + Maracuja oil = great series/moisturizer

Raw honey= great skin exfoliation (leave on for 10 min for extra soft skin) 

Olive oil + honey + rice water (or regular water) = super hydrating hair mask. Leave on for 15 min and shampoo out

5626 2018-03-16 18:47:12 this is ur "Oil" this is ur "He"
5627 2018-03-16 18:47:11 The only reason to spend money on renewables now is for when we run out of oil and uranium... more than 100 years but you have some valid points. Your only real error was that a carbon tax today is not detrimental.
5628 2018-03-16 18:46:58 Not necessarily. It's the State that wants us to remain dependent on foreign oil, not the populace. The people want energy that doesn't pollute and isn't derived from a finite resource. The polling numbers are a farce.

5631 2018-03-16 18:46:44 Tanning helps me “hide” them but it all depends on your skin. I heard really good things about bio oil which I recently started issuing but I think you have to use it for long periods of time and constantly (up to 2 times a day) for it to actually work.
5632 2018-03-16 18:46:44 No idea how many it would take... how many before you turned into a skank, just so I have an idea ;)
5633 2018-03-16 18:46:40 It shouldn’t work against the morphine but the doses the can give are high enough to definitely make her comfortable even without the cbd and thc oil

5642 2018-03-16 18:45:25 I use jojoba oil and Rosehip oil on my face. I switched to a face cream and I immediately broke out. I guess I gotta stick to oil.
5643 2018-03-16 18:45:23 Raw honey on your face for exfoliation. I have a "face scrub" that is raw honey, oats, and sweet almond oil. Leave it on for 10 minutes and face is so smooth 
5644 2018-03-16 18:45:21 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5645 2018-03-16 18:45:18 A tough start to the day for Wilk We ran a 4.004 but as he approached the finish line the engine gave way to fire beneath the FC body.

5647 2018-03-16 18:45:15 Honestly don’t know what I’d do with out my phone during these 3 hour oil changes.
5648 2018-03-16 18:45:14 There's several industry reports highlighting this, royal Dutch Shell has accepted this and are diversifying into renewables as is Saudi Aramco the world's largest oil producer. Canadian oil companies are in denial
5649 2018-03-16 18:45:09 They’re snake oil salesmen.
5650 2018-03-16 18:45:06 Agree on one hand to her we have to protect our environment at any cost and on the other hand oil production increase and tanker traffic is safer for the coast line..I don't know if she knows what she's saying...I think all liberals are that way..Strange no one calls her on that?

5656 2018-03-16 18:44:41 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
5657 2018-03-16 18:44:40 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5659 2018-03-16 18:44:36 I’ve never worked with oil paints before and sadly I couldn’t get any mineral spirits so I’ll have to use turpentine

5662 2018-03-16 18:44:18 You want a mixed message on climate change?  How about the very next time you get on a plane in western Canada THAT OIL CAME FROM THE OIL SANDS.  Your continued use of petroleum while protesting petroleum distributors is the "mixed message" we should discuss.
5663 2018-03-16 18:44:13 stripped out a bunch of stuff and fixed the oil pickup issue today, now food
5664 2018-03-16 18:44:10 i like Casp Doc, think this is the year it will come good, been involved for a few years, they have had problems , hope they are now behind them and the oil starts to flow,
5665 2018-03-16 18:44:02 Yeah, kill more American soldiers for your riches and oil! Call it patriotism!
5666 2018-03-16 18:44:00 some good ol cannabis oil!!
5667 2018-03-16 18:43:57 Buy jojoba oil, maracuja oil, and rose hip seed oil for your face. Im hoerible at explaining but just look up the benefits of them. Tartes Maracuja oil is like $48 but on Amazon each of them costs $13.
5668 2018-03-16 18:43:57 You have to realize the inevitable, crude demand will peak within the next decade, the price of oil right now is artificially inflated by opec production cutbacks. Oil sands will die first, they're the highest cost oil in the world
5669 2018-03-16 18:43:56 Oilers gonna Oil

5674 2018-03-16 18:43:21 Not even remotely a Tory.

Pretty sure Russia doesn’t fancy its chances against NATO. Turns off the gas? Remember when all civilisation collapsed when the Arab world turned off the oil? Get real. 

No one wants war. Existence of nukes makes direct war impossible. Only sanctions.
5675 2018-03-16 18:43:20 Yooo it really almost cost me 100$ for an oil change?? Geez

5679 2018-03-16 18:42:33 Kale? Isn’t that the stuff farmers used to feed to cattle in the days before hipsters and coconut oil?
5680 2018-03-16 18:42:31 America has the greatest sense of smell for oil. That's the greatness we know.
5681 2018-03-16 18:42:22 Had a scheduled oil change at @FirestoneTires for 1:00. It’s now 2:40 and the jobs still not done. #ridiculous

5690 2018-03-16 18:41:40 Right.  I am not interested in undermining Sierra Club.  I think oil drilling is horrendous, but they need to understand that even if you block coastal drilling, the oil drilling is going to happen somewhere due to increased VMT.

5694 2018-03-16 18:41:04 "Gal Gadot" and "repulse" go together like oil and water
5695 2018-03-16 18:40:59 We are also buying oil from the US and shipping it up the coast at a much higher cost than buying it from AB. A pipeline would reduce tanker traffic from the US through Pudget Sound.
5696 2018-03-16 18:40:58 That won’t work. O3 depletion doesn’t contribute to Climate Change.

Must burn oil! Gas! Trees! Anything that burns. Burn it all!

Cover the wheat fields with salt so nothing will grow. 

We’ve got to destroy everything before Putin takes control. Leave him with nothing! 
5697 2018-03-16 18:40:55 Exactly. I'm all for legalizing weed, for people being able to use CBD oil or edibles to treat illnesses if it helps them. 

But guys, it's not a miracle cure. It's not going to magically fix everything. Stop acting like it's the be-all and end-all of treatments.
5698 2018-03-16 18:40:48 So aperture from oil exactly the same as Greece ? Dearie me that's embarrassing even for a fanatic !

5708 2018-03-16 18:39:39 Is that just a belief or do you have evidence. There are many things people believe in but that does not make them true. I understand that clinical trials on the effectiveness of C oil are being discussed so the validity of your belief may well be tested.

5712 2018-03-16 18:39:06 Every road trip is a gamble. Will I get a speeding ticket? Will my car break down? I think I can win but I know I don't deserve to because I drive like a bat out of hell and I haven't had an oil change since 'Nam
5713 2018-03-16 18:39:04 The golden rule in Canada...if it is an oil company, based in Vancouver, avoid.  Sames goes for mining companies based out of Calgary.

5715 2018-03-16 18:39:01 China's petrogold trade gives bullion to its oil suppliers. Holding Euros is just holding gold promises backed by Draghi. Oil producers globally will likely trust holding bullion more than Mr. Whatever-It-Takes' paper. Add a zero to gold price and Europe can deliver.  #petrogold

5717 2018-03-16 18:38:55 a totally normal thing to say from a totally normal guy
5718 2018-03-16 18:38:45 Wrong on all accounts  
Think coconut oil and the Real Thing 
5719 2018-03-16 18:38:44 Liberals think loserish comments like that are clever. I cringe when I read their rebuttals almost always. Imagine going that far back into sometimes Tweets and producing that tweet thinking ‘gotcha!’  They’re so pathetic I sometimes feel bad for them.
5720 2018-03-16 18:38:34 HAHAHAHA minsan sumusupsup ng virgin coconut oil. Minsan sumsupsup ng ʸᵉˡᵒ

5722 2018-03-16 18:38:26 Mulvaney is just another secretary appointed by Trump to dismantle the agency they are supposed to be working to protect. He is just like Pruitt at the EPA (won't protect environment) and Zinke at Interior ( gives our monument lands to big oil to drill). Carson at HUD is another.

5724 2018-03-16 18:38:17 This Eucalyptus essential oil smells like Pinesol. Would not order this brand again. The oils business is just getting off the ground. Made four bottles for us. My clients are family. So far, so good. Getting the scents right. #business #beauty #skincare #haircare #Oils

5727 2018-03-16 18:37:29 my view on US canada -- 

US runs a small surplus in manufactures/ small deficit in commodities (oil), but basically it is close to being in balance. 

Services trade globally hugely distorted by trade in intangibles with tax centers so not sure you can really sort out much there
5728 2018-03-16 18:37:28 The fact I'm being told how important it is makes me dismiss it totally.
5729 2018-03-16 18:37:27 Oil is fucked
5730 2018-03-16 18:37:12 I just remade my #Hoodoo money oil lamp. Yesterday I sensed negative energy from it and no matter how many times I changed the wick, it would not stay lit so I was guided to remake it today. There was black smoke coming out from the flame which means negative energy is leaving.
5731 2018-03-16 18:37:11 GOP primary gonna be like Glengarry Glen Ross, except they'll be selling snake oil.
5732 2018-03-16 18:37:11 I need to learn how to do my own oil changes 
5733 2018-03-16 18:37:06 Didn't read it all. The oil doesn't get in the blood then?
5734 2018-03-16 18:37:05 @LeoDiCaprio @MarkRuffalo @EllenPage Can y'all sue the EPA please and make them enforce environmental regulations? The Governator is suing Big Oil...go get the @EPA 
 I'd do it but I'm saddled with a ton of student loan debt.
5735 2018-03-16 18:36:48 By the way I do get the newest study about bituman balls not needing to be put in thin oil.

5755 2018-03-16 18:33:52 Lavender. If you can find a sachet with fresh lavender (fresh enough for a fairly strong scent) or an oil, just breathe in the aroma. If have sachet or something can place on pillow (or near your face) as go to sleep), that would be good follow-up to deep-breathing its aroma.

5766 2018-03-16 18:32:34 you havent told me, its been  confusing. So youre logic is Liverpool should win because City have oil money and would otherwise be irrelevant? Somehow "the only English team [you] can stand" is the one that has fans who think Firmino > Auba and banks on trophies from 10+ yrs ago

5777 2018-03-16 18:30:59 Hi Kate I love organic soaps and facial oils mixed with citrus, prickly pear and neroli or just plain oils like almond oil. I am trying to get away from chemicals on my skin. My skin is clearer as a result. I do get the occasional blemish and it is such a big deal. Lol take care
5778 2018-03-16 18:30:54 "Vladimir Putin said that “IS has big money, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, from selling oil [to Turkey]. In addition they are protected by the military of an entire nation. One can understand why they are acting so boldly and blatantly. "

5786 2018-03-16 18:30:06 The struggle is real. And those of us who have been here for a while remember the terrifying time that made the Interior Energy Project a necessity - when heating oil cost $4 per gallon and people were spending $1000 or more per month to heat a single-family home.
5787 2018-03-16 18:30:02 Seriously considering changing my own oil but like ugh

5789 2018-03-16 18:29:52 You know, if I were a US or Mid East oil man, I would do the same since Cdns are so gullible and won't stand up to a fight.
5790 2018-03-16 18:29:44 l hate oil business
5791 2018-03-16 18:29:43 Some local readjustments might be necessary but in the end shale oil is much more valuable than Mexican Maya or kind of Venezuelan Tar. And likely drop in diesel demand in Europe should help rebalance the light/heavy picture.

5795 2018-03-16 18:28:53 This is just rumor, and from people I trust. But back when my local dirt track used to host the Lucas oil late models once a year, they’d pay bloomquist $5-10k just to show up. Can’t imagine what a cup driver might cost.

5797 2018-03-16 18:28:30 So is tanker traffic, but who cares about marine species when China wants Alberta oil to literally make more goods that contribute to ocean plastics.

5802 2018-03-16 18:28:00 The entire surface of the Earth was covered with water for approximately a year. Due to the immense pressure from the weight of all that water tectonic shifting increased. In that time fossils were created and so was oil.

5832 2018-03-16 18:24:14 I struggle with this, and have in the past covering energy: "Fracking and oil drilling are two different things, duh." Shows up in guns, too: "That's not an AK-47, your point is invalid."
Either way, onus is on explainer to be clear, but make sure explanation is accessible.
5833 2018-03-16 18:24:07 There are many differences (dictatorship throughout the 20th century, very poor, not a super power or even a power, more blatant (arguably) corruption), why isolate one variable like it explains everything? Venezuela sells oil, their woes are also largely market-driven.
5834 2018-03-16 18:24:06 Nobody else remember the racism/misogyny/homophobia. losing loved ones to diseases/cancers that are easily cured now. The Eire/NI troubles, 3 day week/oil crisis. Cars = death traps, hooligans @ the .  2 channels on the . Pollution(&  ) everywhere?
5835 2018-03-16 18:24:02 Do agree more offensively gifted, Kass is also having a down year for sure. But that said if Kass is playing 4th line hes not worth the money, if he gets promoted next year, and maybe plays a more 3rd line role, than totally fine with that contract

5837 2018-03-16 18:23:43 I just witnessed a mother putting DEEP TANNING OIL on her daughter who couldn’t have been more than five. The kid kept asking why she needed it and telling her mom to stop putting so much on and her mother ignored her the entire time. What is wrong w the world.
5838 2018-03-16 18:23:41 I wish I done a before and after photo of my brows. Started using caster oil most nights on my brows since jan and I swear the growth is real! So gals if you need some growth on them brows #casteroil I swear by it! Haha
5839 2018-03-16 18:23:19 They did base it on oil though. Specifically on 7-8bn of oil taxes. Anyway, I’m glad we’re now debating facts rather than silly conspiracies.
5840 2018-03-16 18:23:15 Turkey is complicit because Turkey was stealing Syrian oil in exchange for arming ISIS. Russia went in at the request of Assad and started bombing the convoys.

5844 2018-03-16 18:22:36 They've spunked their reserves the economy pancakes with the oil price. The banking system is creaking. Interest rates crippled the consumer. Paranoid dictators are want to stir up a bit of agitation overseas to galvanize support.
5845 2018-03-16 18:22:30 No, you've been nothing but a massive disappointment. Stop pandering to Alberta, they will literally never vote Liberal. If the environment & economy go together why aren't we investing in cleaner tech, studies show they create more jobs than oil/gas?

5851 2018-03-16 18:22:03 OIL!
5852 2018-03-16 18:21:58 did you use any growth oil or anything?
5853 2018-03-16 18:21:54 That's a hand router, sometimes known as a "granny's tooth". Oil stone or diamond whetstone works.
5854 2018-03-16 18:21:39 Chicken Caesar Wrap, olive oil chips, spinach salad, coffee. I feel good. Ready to type even faster.
5855 2018-03-16 18:21:38 She can give you all the proof in the world and it doesn’t matter. You will choose not to accept it. Doesn’t matter anyway. Pipeline ain’t getting built. Economics will kill it. World is moving away from oil
5856 2018-03-16 18:21:34 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA ökade med 6 denna veckan till 990 (årsskiftet 929) enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil
5857 2018-03-16 18:21:30 Just googled what goes into a Telsa service and how often. It never crossed my mind until now..such a foreign concept to me. I've only just owned a vehicle for a year now that takes synthetic oil..lol. Previous 14 years I had to go in every 3k miles.
5858 2018-03-16 18:21:26 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5859 2018-03-16 18:21:10 I was scheduled for an oil change at 1, but I’m STILL. HERE. WAITING. 
5860 2018-03-16 18:21:07 Aloe Vera the plant or get ointment from pharmacy. It should work love. But lavender and tea tree oil are also antiseptic/antifungal

5862 2018-03-16 18:21:02 Why are you such an obvious snake oil salesman @matthewsyed?

Why do you never talk about marginal gains any more.

Gorilla oil
5869 2018-03-16 18:20:15 It's not that I CAN'T get oil changes and other necessary car maintenance, but I absolutely hate it (and the snooty attitudes I often encounter from the employees), so if I ever get married, it will be written in our vows that he has to deal with cars.
5870 2018-03-16 18:20:10 I think there will be structural tightness in the oil market over the next few years or until recession hits so I think that will be the driving theme but as usual won't be a straight line & plenty of room for the dollar bounce we both see to create some havoc in the meantime!
5871 2018-03-16 18:19:55 Even though my car has less than 75k mines on it i still have to get high mileage oil change because it’s a Camaro, so it’s like 60 bucks. 
5872 2018-03-16 18:19:54 @ddm_oficial buenas tardes. Soy la esposa de uno de los (tantos) empleados de Destileria OIL San Lorenzo.

5875 2018-03-16 18:19:28 Oil kills birds. Are you against oil? how about guns?
5876 2018-03-16 18:19:27 things that I like: when you go to an Italian restaurant and they give you seasoned oil to dip your bread in. like fam you’re actually eating straight up oil. love it
5877 2018-03-16 18:19:19 More food plans! Now lunch at Industrial Eatts, wine at Alma Rosa in Buellton and then olive oil tasting in Paso Robles!
5878 2018-03-16 18:19:09 Will never be able to convince these people. Will just have to wait till electric cars take over and oil prices collapse. Then economics will kill this pipeline
5879 2018-03-16 18:18:54 I have introduced the family to oil pastels!!! Dan likes!!
5880 2018-03-16 18:18:52 Trump doesn't need to pound his chest to hurt Putin. He's supplying weapons to Ukraine and again the gas/oil monopoly Putin had is gone
5881 2018-03-16 18:18:50 It is shameful that "clean, green" Oregon has sold out its natural resources. Environmental accountability is needed: clearcutting, air pollution, water pollution, oil spills from trains - the list is endless. Time to clean up!
5882 2018-03-16 18:18:43 Finally dropping my car off to get my tire fixed and an oil change  now i just need time do my breaks before i make this drive to Chicago 
5883 2018-03-16 18:18:40 Spicy "veggie" "shawarma"

You're welcome

5893 2018-03-16 18:18:04 I like you dude. You're cool. But please don't think that we're stupid. This was over oil and gas. After Iraq, its army fled north and found haven in Southern Syria. Assad, instead of fighting them, was forced to fight a SECOND FRONT Obama opened with FSA.

5895 2018-03-16 18:17:55 You also forget to mention under Obama the US built 1000's of miles of pipelines and more than doubled exports of US oil to eastern Canada - good business for them to fund anti pipeline groups here & land lock our oil & even block them within our own country - Canada is stupid
5896 2018-03-16 18:17:53 that would be french fry oil drinking C**t lol

5898 2018-03-16 18:17:34 Geez CBD oil works wonders. Why the hell is this stuff not more widespread?
5899 2018-03-16 18:17:26 Gimme 

You could also fry it with sesame oil to make it less spice and pungent! 
5900 2018-03-16 18:17:24 Then we disagree on that specidic. If you look at his usage, he’s a 3/4.
5901 2018-03-16 18:17:22 u know water and oil dont mix.
5902 2018-03-16 18:17:09 Not sure. I use a Sallys version of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo and conditioner daily with Aphogee Keratin rebuilder every other day. No issues with stuff like that.
5903 2018-03-16 18:16:58 Don’t use charcoal omfg that dries out oil
5904 2018-03-16 18:16:52 Imagine how much Pruitt's also pocketing from the oil companies.
5905 2018-03-16 18:16:36 Ye. I recommend Westchase cause I think it’s the gateway area for the oil market? That’s what my customers say anyways
5906 2018-03-16 18:16:32 We should just have bonfires of coal doused with crude oil.
5907 2018-03-16 18:16:30 Go and oil your own machine
5908 2018-03-16 18:16:30 Trump's actions against Russia have been stronger than the prior administration. The oil/gas alone which doesn't get near enough coverage is huge. You want to hurt Putin, that's the way to do it
5909 2018-03-16 18:16:25 I have made balsamic vinegar w toasted sesame oil as well as siracha (sp). They keep getting more yummy.
5910 2018-03-16 18:16:22 No!!! I need 400% rosemary olive oil flavor!! I want it to kill me!!!!!!

5915 2018-03-16 18:15:54 If olive oil didn't help I doubt cooking oil would and that sounds so risky
5916 2018-03-16 18:15:53 My doctor said not only were the drugs expensive, but they didn’t work well and some might even cause kidney failure.
He said keep the nails filed thin, keep feet dry, go barefoot as often as possible, soak nails in vinegar for 20 minutes 2x a day, tea tree oil on the nails.
5917 2018-03-16 18:15:49 Hold bevel on oil stone at fixed angle. If necessary put a stick of scrap under other end to maintain angle. When flat do the sole. Not hard.Keep sharp and take shallow cuts. Don't "scrub" with it!!
5918 2018-03-16 18:15:31 I need some hair oil

5921 2018-03-16 18:15:11 He is a snake oil salesman, plain and simple. He will say anything in furtherance of his agenda which is getting money.
5922 2018-03-16 18:15:04 has anyone looked back at the year 1973 when the US stayed on DST after the oil embargo? Guessing our legislators don't have time to research.
5923 2018-03-16 18:15:03 You made it , OK here is the assessment -Oil thoda Jyada hai, matar thode se kamm hai, aur namak dikhai nhi de rha  ..mirchi thodi teekhi hai uff..

5927 2018-03-16 18:14:13 I think someone spilled oil on wharf st. my office STINKS of it. and I'm hoping it's coming from outside.
5928 2018-03-16 18:14:09 I wonder if an oil pipeline would help with this problem?
5929 2018-03-16 18:14:01 The oil/chemical market in Houston is fucking huge. Look at the Westchase area. There’s a bunch of offices and the apts are cheap
5930 2018-03-16 18:13:52 Canada Rig Count is down 54 rigs from last week to 219, with #oil rigs down 52 to 144 and #gas rigs down 2 to 75.
5931 2018-03-16 18:13:45 As someone said earlier, drop out the blade & use an oil stone. Avoid rounded edges by sharpening the cutting surface 70% (7 strokes) & the upper edge 30% (3 strokes).
5932 2018-03-16 18:13:43 They had to check the oil leveller if it needed refill? 
5933 2018-03-16 18:13:35 Get that Jamaican Castor Oil

5936 2018-03-16 18:13:08 Paid 60$ for an oil change. They be taxing man.
5937 2018-03-16 18:13:01 @CertasBusiness @ValueOils my 73 yr old mum let down. No oil delivered on promised used day. No apology. No news. Freezing weekend. All sorts of phone calls and total let down. Final call, on hold for  nearly an hour then cut off. What are you going to do about it?
5938 2018-03-16 18:13:01 Oil change , then Outlet mall is on my agenda
5939 2018-03-16 18:12:57 Almost the opposite - trying to preserve the world's natural resources by installing a ground source heat pump. If they find oil it'll be a bonus though!

5944 2018-03-16 18:12:36 Yes, Zanu pf and Accountability are like oil and water,they don't mix.
5945 2018-03-16 18:12:36 (1/2) Dagens konspirasjonsteori: Timingen for navnebytte til #equinor virker umotivert. Jeg mistenker at Statoil ikke nødvendigvis bare vil bort fra oil, men vil distansere seg fra Stat. At Statoil fjerner seg fra statsselskap-branding gjør forholdene bedre for en stor fusjon.
5946 2018-03-16 18:12:34 I usually feel bad about how little I know about cars, but my man next to me at the oil change going on about 5 minutes trying to pop the hood. #feelinggoodaboutmyself
5947 2018-03-16 18:12:24 My god, THIS. I have an allergy to the oil, but IT SHOULDN’T EVEN MATTER. It’s likely that someone with chronic pain has explored most every commonly considered avenue. Just...don’t.
5948 2018-03-16 18:12:15 Fannie and Freddie make more money than the big Oil companies and are a great service for the 30 year loan. This used to be a pensioners stock because of stability and great dividends.
There has been alot of diservice to Americans.

5962 2018-03-16 18:10:43 I feel like such an adult! I went to work and did my expense request, got an oil change, went to the bank, and got groceries for the special dinner I’m making tonight 
5963 2018-03-16 18:10:31 @BoyhanVictor The council are threatening to take me to High Court over an alleged oil spill. They want my garden dug up I believe to remove sewage pollution.I could do with your help

5967 2018-03-16 18:10:16 My husband really has tried snake oil for hand pain! Our ex brought a pot back from Peru where it’s a traditional topical remedy. You’ll be unsurprised to hear it doesn’t work on Dupuytren's Contracture.

5970 2018-03-16 18:09:51 You would think if it were such a great idea the oil companies would pounce on it but they're not. Prairie farmers cannot get their grain to market because of rail delays. Cannot see it working in the near future.
5971 2018-03-16 18:09:44 I have been using cbd oil to help with cramps the past couple months and it has actually been helping soooo much. See if you can find somewhere to buy a tincture!
5972 2018-03-16 18:09:43 Yeah I think oil based cleansers are the best too! It is so hard, I still struggle with oiliness I think it is also a hormonal thing too

5981 2018-03-16 18:08:23 Yikes...so you're an "adult" that looks at teenage girls' "hotness," hey? Creeeeeeeeeepy.
5982 2018-03-16 18:07:58 Despite revenue collections from border customs, airports, taxes, oil production, donors contributions. Even no salaries for employees. We are told that there is no money at Central Bank....where is the money going? very sad!!!
5983 2018-03-16 18:07:52 Don't think at just 1000 barrels a day being treated it would be very economically feasible for oil companies though.
5984 2018-03-16 18:07:50 I can easily see ADT share price going lower than $7/share before we see any type of recovery in share price , that is my opinion , I have been wrong before , but Oil stocks and energy have been slammed past few years , that is the sector im looking at right now,buy low sell high
5985 2018-03-16 18:07:49 I've deffo upped the oil in recent years and now only really use oil based cleansers and try to use rosehip oil when I can (I find my spot cream doesn't sit on top of it very well so it's a toss up between spots or oil control, haha) but I'll definitely bear this in mind-thank u!
5986 2018-03-16 18:07:29 Recipe says I have to 'drizzle' the oil into the frying pan but I just poured it. Hopefully I'll get away with it
5987 2018-03-16 18:07:29 I usually use WD-40 and an old toothbrush, and a fresh application of some oil/lube to the chain and drive train components, including breaks, leavers and cable sleeves...

It was mainly used when making door linnings, as I did when I was an apprentice To sharpen you remove the blade and rub on an oil stone the same as a chisel

5991 2018-03-16 18:07:06 Such a shame that this response was initially so slow and lacklustre. The oil spread over weeks of ineffective measures has caused so much more damage and distress to wildlife & the waterway ecology. With little concern for boaters health or affected waterways businesses.
5992 2018-03-16 18:07:02 Word is he wants to get the hell outta Texas for reasons you only need one guess on. Problem with Shaka is his contract is sealed so he could have oil rigs included for all we know.

6032 2018-03-16 18:03:12 Yes Scotland didn't base our economy on oil taxes. You know they said it was a bonus. Ask poor Norway.  The bullocks is you defending the Tories stance as they have form (as do Labour) in the cover up of Scotlands wealth. Hiding the wealth is the conspiracy

6067 2018-03-16 17:59:22 What about @realDonaldTrump & his conscience?
What about this ability to sacrifice values to reach his own selfish ends.  To sacrifice the loss of lands to big oil, environment, clean air & water.
Is empathy for these things now become the aberration?

6133 2018-03-16 17:51:30 Once Russia flipped from total state control and the version of communism they had to rampant capitalism once the oil started to flow, they used the exact same tools but in a new set-up, adding internet powers to their extensive toolkit.
6134 2018-03-16 17:51:27 Maybe that generation shouldn’t have let communist have opinions!

6137 2018-03-16 17:51:01 What I got from this is he’s a legend in his own mind. He did a garbage job after being an oil CEO. His entire existence is based on stripping America for parts. But now he wants to have a soul? I dunno. Delusional.

6142 2018-03-16 17:49:55 Having three men speak (one of them twice) before the first women spoke at an event to highlight “the prominent role women play” in the #oil_gas_industry further illustrates why the industry needs to #LetWomenSpeak!

6166 2018-03-16 17:47:25 Let's fix @realDonaldTrump 's problem and refuse to sell ANY oil to the US. Then they will have a surplus in goods as well as services, as well as overall (Already US has surplus in services and overall trade with Canada). #USPolitics

6173 2018-03-16 17:46:21 My brother asked my for cooking oil, which I don't have. I think by the smell, he's cooking his steak in butter.

It smells wrong.

So very, very wrong.

6176 2018-03-16 17:46:00 Yes you’ll love it! Once I started treating my hair consistently with it, my hair started to get so much fuller and it didn’t break off so easily. I mix it with black castro oil 
6177 2018-03-16 17:45:50 is there any way to find the contributions from natural resources ( mines of Jharkhand / Orisha , oil of NE )?
6178 2018-03-16 17:45:48 Put them under your tongue. But get oil based ones not alcohol because the alcohol one will burn if you put it under your tongue
6179 2018-03-16 17:45:46 nope on the butter.  Just flour and oil, stir vigorously to keep is from burning.
6180 2018-03-16 17:45:43 I wish I could work in the oil field lol some good money there

Obvious because it did not result in higher consumer outgo. it was contractionary for oil producers. are citizens oil producers?

and tired are $40,000.

6197 2018-03-16 17:44:03 You are lying. Only if you consider goods only is there a deficit and there only due to oil. Services has surplus and over there is a surplus.
6198 2018-03-16 17:44:02 My point is that NG pipelines don't pose the same risks as oil pipeline do so equating the two is wrong.
6199 2018-03-16 17:43:56 Trying to drill for oil in your (my) backyard.
6200 2018-03-16 17:43:55 Let me get up..go get this oil change and get my car checked out
6201 2018-03-16 17:43:44 Update on Camp du Roi:

The roads affected by the earlier oil spill are being continually sanded and are likely to remain closed for the next few hours.

When they do reopen, a 15mph speed limit will be in place.

Motorists should drive with extreme caution in the area.

6204 2018-03-16 17:43:41 True, but Russia’s struggles in the 90s were mostly a result of historically low oil prices, and essentially disappeared during the 2000s energy crisis. Basically, the USSR collapsed at the most inopportune time, and Putin happened to rise to power at the most opportune time

6206 2018-03-16 17:42:55 I've been waiting for at least a hour for this oil change 
6207 2018-03-16 17:42:43 Cannon service is beyond horrible. I’ve been here since 10 and they’re just now pulling my car for an oil change 
6208 2018-03-16 17:42:20 I’ve been getting into oil painting and I’m excited to start working on three paintings at once.
6209 2018-03-16 17:42:07 Good. Their job is emergency response to disasters to make sure contained and those affected are helped. This has nothing to do with Al's scheme to shift money from oil barons to green energy hucksters.
6210 2018-03-16 17:42:02 They know I smoke when I'm not pregnant but they say nothing about it, because at the end of the day idc what they have to say, but my mom is all for like medical cannabis oil and stuff like that
6211 2018-03-16 17:42:01 Yes it’s a byproduct of palm oil industry, however using it still makes us complicit in rainforest destruction. Does not fit with positioning products within high value markets. 
Deer industry big user, many of us won’t go near it as we understand our consumers expectations
6212 2018-03-16 17:41:58 ok im curious  i do mine  for 24-48 hours  find when i do make my massage oil it makes people pass out(sleep) within 15 minutes of application(light shoulder rub)  how strong is it after 45 mins?  jst curious  i might want to try one out  to see the difference it in oil strength
6213 2018-03-16 17:41:53 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
6214 2018-03-16 17:41:45 @realDonaldTrump When are you going to lower gas and fuel oil prices?  It's been over a year.
6215 2018-03-16 17:41:28 Springtime is the worst for me. I've started using peppermint essential oil. So far so good. Hope you feel better soon.
6216 2018-03-16 17:41:20 And I'm now reading the bio of his first wife, Ivana. Another gold digger. Trump has a pattern alright. He also has a predator type of personality. There is nothing wrong with males desiring and perusing females. But Trump takes it to wrong levels.........really wrong levels.
6217 2018-03-16 17:41:10 This is awesome.... wait... did @SecretaryZinke strap mineral/oil/gas detection vests on them or something?  How in the world is he letting this happen! 
6218 2018-03-16 17:40:55 Do you really anybodys going to pay $20 a gallon for gas or heating oil so that everybody in the country can get a basic income? Saying "we just need to end it" doesn't make it so. Learn more about carbon tax/fee & dividend at @citizensclimate, @TheCLCouncil, @SforCD, etc.
6219 2018-03-16 17:40:51 @POTUS strategy on #Russia is to dominate the market on oil/gas to strangle #putin 's income, it's working. Europe could do more by applying #RussianSanctions on energy also but they probably won't. A US/Europe joint effort will bring  #putin to the table for real negotiations.

Russia would not enter into a clash with Turkey it is a trap US wants them 2 fall in. Sadly Kurds r victims of US vs Russia war
6230 2018-03-16 17:39:20 Eastern Syria's resources (oil and cotton export) were a major part of government revenues before the war. With economy in ruin and none willing to pay the bill for reconstruction Assad will badly need these resources.
6231 2018-03-16 17:39:20 Why petrol/ diesel /gas prices increasing despite crude oil prices not increasing worldwide
6232 2018-03-16 17:39:17 Wall Street's main indexes rose on Friday after strong economic data boosted financial stocks and a jump in oil prices lifted shares of energy companies.

6275 2018-03-16 17:34:59 Except for the fact that even with the ctax we still have the absolute lowest taxes in the country. We don't need a tax cut, we need a tax increase. Or the oil rollercoaster will destroy our public services.

My mum has no heating at all, is 73 and being told nothing can be done until next week after this freezing weekend.
6328 2018-03-16 17:25:54 Glad to finally see the Oil and Gas companies getting there way!

6338 2018-03-16 17:24:06 Be in bed if it helps you! You are deserving of rest. I was told that CBD oil causes the gut to relax and release due to lowered stress and inflammation. My body is "clearing out" the blockages.

6344 2018-03-16 17:23:30 @marketcall Joseph given your opening remarks about immediate future oil prices tanking should I continue to listen.
6345 2018-03-16 17:23:21 It’s a super absorbable oil, which makes it great for your hair but it clogs your pores!
6346 2018-03-16 17:23:14 Interesting fact, orcas are only affected by tankers carrying Canadian oil, not American oil...#eyeroll
6347 2018-03-16 17:23:12 Subarus have been known to burn extra oil because of their pistons. Too much oil burning and not enough fuel burning can cause the gas to become rich over time. Not to mention that subarus generally get modified which can easily add to the problem if it's not tuned right

6358 2018-03-16 17:21:51 If they're serious about Keep it In The Ground, keep oil prices low. It's that simple. Oil companies don't heed environmentalists, but they heed economic reality. If alternatives ramp up and oil prices stay low, they'll never have the incentive to drill in pristine areas.

6413 2018-03-16 17:14:44 Watching the weather channel while the shop is changing my oil. The story: having to move cows in the North due to snow.

Reporter: Time to moooooove them out

Reporter 5 minutes later: still laughing at her joke
6414 2018-03-16 17:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
6415 2018-03-16 17:14:33 Nope, dat wos dad’s chip mashine, it’s one of dem fryers wot u only puts a lickle bit of oil in
6416 2018-03-16 17:14:23 While you’re putting your nose in elections, sitting on your dairy aire tweeting everyday, Russia is sending mercenaries to steal oil fields in the Middle East. Not being able to walk and chew gum at the same time is hurting this country! Get Off Twitter!!
6417 2018-03-16 17:14:21 Nope.

6421 2018-03-16 17:14:10 Washington State has five oil refineries...and some 500 tankers a year inbound from Alaska. He thinks our tanker traffic is a problem?
6422 2018-03-16 17:14:01 AGREED! But at least it’ll save me from being arrested WITH a med card for a single cartridge of oil, but yes I do not want the gov. to touch marijuana with their ridiculous regulations

6425 2018-03-16 17:13:50 Russia is mucking about in Libya uncontested and mostly unreported.  They will soon have their own puppet regime and a military base established there.  Guess who will control the oil?
6426 2018-03-16 17:13:46 U can build with it nut he likes smashing it right away. 8 cups flour 1 cup baby oil

6430 2018-03-16 17:13:28 The big number for me today in the Baker Rig Count was +17 Horizontal rigs. These are the most productive, factors greater than vertical or directional wells. #oott

+1 Misc

6432 2018-03-16 17:13:20 Developing the tar sands is irresponsible : it will have a great and irreversible impact on air, soil and water It's the worst way to obtain oil
6433 2018-03-16 17:13:18 US recap: Four more oil rigs are up and US oil production is +599Kbpd since the beginning of the year, and it’s only the middle of March. Cushing may be down to 35%, but total commercial storage is up over 6M barrels and SPR is up 1.7MB. Exports steady at 1.45Mbpd #OOTT

6459 2018-03-16 17:10:16 LMAO. I hate how the media claims Trump had "an affair" with Stormy Daniels. Dude, she is a sex worker. I'm not trying to dehumanize her, but I doubt she would want to have free non-relationship sex with a 60 year old Donald Trump. Watch her expose his prostitute habits now.
6460 2018-03-16 17:10:13 There should be a store where you can get your oil changed and also a hair cut. Kinda have to do those things today.

6466 2018-03-16 17:09:45 Same here but it disappears too quick. And it's not just moist, my skin also doesn't produce any natural oil. So I'm permanently creaming and oiling. Even coconut oil disappears completely in a few minutes

6472 2018-03-16 17:09:02 for clarification that's 2012 and 2013 (504 crude oil quotes, 502 HAL and SLB quotes). Probably not the proper methodology but think it does a generally good job of rebutting.

6481 2018-03-16 17:08:17 When you eat Italian Beef you have to be dirty. Let the oil spill everywhere, let beef fall on your clothes. If you can accept that, you'll enjoy it dipped.
6482 2018-03-16 17:08:16 You can also get it cheaper if you buy the oil + filter yourself and essentially just pay for the labor involved in doing the oil change.
6483 2018-03-16 17:08:16 In case you were wondering what it’s like to date a mechanic:
For our anniversary he’s getting me new tires, an alignment and an oil change!  thanks babe, without you, I’d be broken down on the side of the road somewhere
6484 2018-03-16 17:08:05 Of course, oil and gas companies are against this. Makes you think....
Either way, if SCOTUS never formalized the decision, isn't it like not signing a contract? Invalid?
6485 2018-03-16 17:07:56 Oh no don’t do it. I did that shit in my car and busted my oil pan 
6486 2018-03-16 17:07:54 .@GovInslee says #WashState is looking at a suite of laws to protect the marine environment from oil tankers plying US waters in relation to the @TransMtn. Says ship noise harming Wash State Orca population. #bcpoli

6505 2018-03-16 17:06:13 The way he made himself available to be exposed on BBC London as corrupt ex president was laughable. I wish it was possible in Nigeria to investigate exp in the last10yrs. All oil blocks given free be withdrawn. Why there is a law like these if Any? If not why not investigate
6506 2018-03-16 17:06:10 I suppose that takes some of the guesswork out of it. 
6507 2018-03-16 17:06:07 Does this woman realize oil is dying, she hasn't read many industry reports on oil forecast and the industry disruption of EV's has she. Classic albertans, in denial

6524 2018-03-16 17:04:49 Nice try! Actually it just means more petroluem... more oil spills, more carcinogens and more contaminated soil, water and air! #ethanol.
6525 2018-03-16 17:04:48 Yes they were talking about I need a tire rotation which I did get and some other bs like a test drive on my car or something I was like huh? Lol so I got my oil change and tire rotation.

6527 2018-03-16 17:04:34 US troops aren't fighting ISIS and more so US allowed ISIS to take those very oil fields years ago. US shouldn't be in Syria, how they can justify killing 300 Russians is absolutely insane.
6528 2018-03-16 17:04:27 .@GovInslee says every oil well is essentially an oil spill from the perspective of it ends up in our air and in our water by coming out of exhaust pipes. #bcpoli #uspoli

6537 2018-03-16 17:03:04 I covered my oil short earlier in the week anyhow
6538 2018-03-16 17:02:56 Today Putin sent un-uniformed troops to take over refineries in Syria. Putin wants a hostile takeover for personal profit. An American General beat him back, killed his 'soldiers'. Remember @POTUS wanting to steal mid east oil & resources? Chilling.
6539 2018-03-16 17:02:55 If oil is propped up again here, you'll see more.
6540 2018-03-16 17:02:44 OK. So we've ditched the secret oil fields bollocks altogther. Nobody ever said oil wasn't good for jobs & industry in Scotland. We said it was daft to base public finances on oil taxes. It was: the case for indy was based on £7-8bn of oil revenues in 16/17. The reality was £208m

6552 2018-03-16 17:02:08 You need to go back to school....Canada sells the USA oil at $34/barrel and the USA sells its oil world wide at $60/barrel. Who is getting the better deal? You are an uneducated president. Messing with NAFTA will hurt the USA more than anyone else.
6553 2018-03-16 17:01:59 Mohammed bin Salman will be on '60 Minutes' on Sunday comparing Iran's Ayatollah to Hitler, and the battle in Ghouta, Syria, is ramping up. You can't be short oil over the weekend with all that going on in the region.

6683 2018-03-16 16:45:48 Blows my fucking mind that I have to explain to grown men that you can't just dump any old oil in your truck. Or that there's people out there with a driver's license that can't change a tire. If you can't do the most basic parts of maintenance do us a favor, shred your license
6684 2018-03-16 16:45:46 Not to mention is own family members cant get full security clearances.  That says alot about this clan of snake oil salesmen...and you buy in hook line and sinker.

6686 2018-03-16 16:45:36 Drizzling olive oil on your food is a reason to stay alive. The combination of flavor is wonderful!

6699 2018-03-16 16:44:07 My car is 10 years old today. It is a reliable car. I change the engine oil and the oil filter every 3 month, rotate the tire every 6 month and service the aircond almost every year. I take care of it and it take care of me.
6700 2018-03-17 23:59:56 Haha. I can relate!! Love the art of shaving products. The oil I use is from a company out of Philly called goodbeardday. Very cool guy. Check it out.
6701 2018-03-17 23:59:43 Finely chop onion and garlic, and celery if using.
Fry onion and garlic (and celery) in olive oil until nicely caramelised. 
Add lardons, cook for 3 more minutes 
Add risotto rice. Fry for 2 minutes.
Add vermouth or white wine. 
(Great aroma!)
Fry off alcohol.
6702 2018-03-17 23:59:30 So sorry Jenn I’m only seeing this now. Yes most are, if you take the oil out the Ramen one is too. I’d add the ginger & garlic to the stock.

6709 2018-03-17 23:58:06 Which is exactly why oil pipelines near important water sources will always be a bad idea. It’s not like it can’t be safe, it’s that the lowest bidder who wants to cut corners, probably won’t make it safe.

If healthy, at goal, enjoy, blend with cinnamon, chocolate.

6744 2018-03-17 23:55:56 I got a bottle of Argan oil at Trader Joe's way cheaper than Ive ever seen it so Ive been using it liberally (full body moisturization) & I've discovered that Argan oil doesn't smell great. Not as bad as Neem oil but not great.
6745 2018-03-17 23:55:54 Any country today would have the same issue.  You'd have to deal with the military first, then the civilians.  It's a deterrent, just like it is to tyranny, I mean how long were we at war with those in the middle East armed with AK-47's?  FIN

6750 2018-03-17 23:54:52 This morn the oil light popped on&it started acting funny, so I put oil in it. Then after work it was driving funny. It was driving slow while I was pressing on the accelerator. Pulled in pep boys& the guy put more oil til I get it looked at

6752 2018-03-17 23:53:53 From the FBI shows that rifles are the least used firearm in crimes.  And that means anything, bolt action single shot 22 to a semi auto 50 Cal.  So efforts to restrict rifles would have little impact on crime, despite many pundits saying otherwise.  As for invasion CONT

6757 2018-03-17 23:52:31 As Markham Hislop has astutely pointed out, part of the oil industry (the majors, the large producers in Canada) have received the memo but the other part of the industry (juniors, well-servicing, etc.) hasn't. He referred to it as a bit of a civil war. @politicalham
6758 2018-03-17 23:52:24 That's good. It means she has friends that care about her and won't let her. Look for a woman that has a good circle of close friends and is close with her family. THAT'S the girl you want.
6759 2018-03-17 23:51:34 The rest of what she says might be wrong. We're in an upward fractal cycle are we not? Short term, it might get higher than that 63-ish level she claimed would invalidate a drop to the mid-50s. Then when it gets there, oil may drop hard to that 55 to 53 level.
6760 2018-03-17 23:51:14 DNA samples can determine sire, but when coal, oil, gas producers hide the content of chemicals they use, then tracing birth defects back to these chemicals is difficult.

6765 2018-03-17 23:49:36 So pipeline protesters aren’t protestors they’re protectors. Protecting the profits of conflict oil and those that make higher profits if CAN oil can’t get to market.
6766 2018-03-17 23:49:34 BTW that was the latest year the FBI included weapon percentages in an easy to find place.  It was also the worst year for my position.  You will notice though that Aggravated Assault makes up most violent crime and involves the least firearms.  Additional information CONT

6775 2018-03-17 23:47:50 What you’ve just said confirms what my NO voting uncle told me 10 years ago when I asked him “how much oil is actually out there”
6776 2018-03-17 23:47:47 I'm ok for protesting but this makes no sense because pipelines r the safest form of transport of oil. It's gonna get built. So just do it legally in court if u have a case and stop wasting our tax dollars destroying our economy and wasting everyone's time.

6781 2018-03-17 23:46:59 Moody's lowered Oman's credit rating today. It estimates that oil prices will fluctuate between $45 and $65 over the medium term... "this means that Oman’s fiscal breakeven oil price of more than $80 per barrel will remain well above actual oil prices"
6782 2018-03-17 23:46:55 My roommate and her boyfriend are discussing what a surprise it was to learn that olive oil is made out of olives.

6817 2018-03-17 23:41:58 By contrast ‘refined’ plant based oils are getting a bad report from science. But coconut oil, Olive oil get better notes. On top of  that, what your ancestors ate matter, your body will usually digest that food more easily. So it will differ for people.

6820 2018-03-17 23:41:32 Maybe the guy who took a job, a job with one of the shittiest administrations ever, to make an oil deal doesn't need our sympathy
6821 2018-03-17 23:40:54 Nothing like driving down the beautiful coast and seeing all these off shore oil drills. Fuck yo moms @ the drill companies.
6822 2018-03-17 23:40:49 Yeah we could definitely learn a lot from our elders. Like how to break the Geneva convention repeatedly, sell billions of dollars in weapons to oil rich monarchy, throw black people in jail for profit, crush workers and unions, lower living standards for future generations, etc.

6830 2018-03-17 23:39:48 With the extra oil poured onto that cock, Dale groaned as Falco worked the oil well into his throbbing flesh. Tingles flowed through his lower body, and he grabbed the avian's ass with a soft squeeze.

"Mmm, that feels a-amazing.. Fuck.."

His hips slowly start to buck.

6835 2018-03-17 23:39:15 As to supplements, the only one we are aware of so far that is thought to have possible benefits is fish oil.  There are many kidney "supplements" sold, typically with no scientific support at all for their use.
6836 2018-03-17 23:39:02 And she also said tht micellar water's function is the same as cleansing oil, the diff is whom it's for. So it depends on your skin :)
6837 2018-03-17 23:38:32 I used to have it really bad. Try to wear a clean headband and pull your hair back every time. Also drink tons of water and use tea tree oil as a spot treatment. Zinc helps balance hormones

6840 2018-03-17 23:38:07 I would walk 50 miles with a 10 gal gas can before I would buy Luk oil. They always seemed like a run down, crappy station.
6841 2018-03-17 23:38:06 Where is all of this U.S. oil coming from?
6842 2018-03-17 23:37:54 2/ And then it's the irony of the Non-OECD reaching for electricity first as manufacturers (in advance of oil use growth), powered by coal, which then sets up those vast grid systems to more easily add wind and solar.

6847 2018-03-17 23:36:58 Have your rice boiling on the side with a pinch of salt. Lol melt some butter or use vegetable oil to sear your steak in a pan or wok; they’re small pieces so they won’t take long.
6848 2018-03-17 23:36:55 This just sounds like the media are losing major sources (McCabe) and they going for their fall back -- BIG OIL ala Cheney. They are literally grasping because they've lied for so long they can't find footing anymore.
6849 2018-03-17 23:36:51 Hi there, i went to aeon wellness for skin analysis and the p.i.c there said that cleansing oil is only for dry skin and that im not supposed to use it as i hve normal skin. It will only add oils to my skin
6850 2018-03-17 23:36:47 So True!
6851 2018-03-17 23:36:35 It's usually because of her parents.
6852 2018-03-17 23:36:17 1/ More like separate development lines coming into a convergence. For oil, it begins in 2000 when oil starts losing market share to other energy resources for 17 years straight. For wind and solar, it's the long, hard slog finally converting to rapid cost declines post 2012.
6853 2018-03-17 23:36:09 Oil demand is forecasted to grow from 97 to ~110 million barrels per day by 2040. How is this possible without expanding fossil fuel extraction? What you’re saying is that this is O-K just as long as Canada isn’t the supplier.
6854 2018-03-17 23:35:54 And thanks for the apology.  That is far more mature and graceful than 99% of tweeters manage.

6860 2018-03-17 23:35:18 Give the protesters in Burnaby what they want. Shut down flow of oil from Alberta to BC. Let's see how they like paying $5.00 a litre for gasoline and no jet fuel for their planes. #KinderMorgam #StopKM #BCpoli #ableg
6861 2018-03-17 23:34:59 Oh & FYI The Koch’s Father worked for both Stalin & Hitler building Oil Refineries & had a German Nazi loving Nanny. Per the Book Dark Money. So I’m guessing their right beside Mercers.
6862 2018-03-17 23:34:57 First, that number is vastly inflated, and must be weighed against the crimes commited with guns.  It is a net loss for the country.  Second, the world is vastly different than it was in  1945.  I'm asking what benefit it is today, not historically.
6863 2018-03-17 23:34:54 Jesus! Wtf????????
6864 2018-03-17 23:34:51 Pipelines are probably the safest way. However do a little homework on km. Bad history of spills. It’s not the pipeline so much as the transport of oil on the west coast that concerns most. Can’t clean up that stuff
6865 2018-03-17 23:34:19 Because all women grow up with a strong desire to bankrupt their parents with a ginormous wedding?
6866 2018-03-17 23:34:12 Agreed. So many people in high places and so many organizations are complicit. The gop, the nra, fox news, sessions. That plus several industries. Coal, oil, maybe even Facebook.

6877 2018-03-17 23:32:31 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
6878 2018-03-17 23:32:21 Lmao @jiffylube trying to charge me $120 for an oil change
6879 2018-03-17 23:32:17 Not caring if Asia gets oil at the expense of the environment probably has some bearing on their motives. Not really complicated.

6890 2018-03-17 23:31:08 He also had a personal stake in seeing Russian sanctions not be implemented.  I think in some ways he *tried* to do a good job.  But his "manage the State Department like an oil company" philosophy all but crippled the Department's effectiveness.

6893 2018-03-17 23:30:45 Pull on any thread in this corrupt mess and it *always* leads to the fossil fuel extraction industry. The entire state of Russia is essentially one big oil and gas company.
6894 2018-03-17 23:30:38 @nnpgrenada Now that we’ve found a potential oil and gas reserve is this going to be nationalised or owned by the GPG?
6895 2018-03-17 23:30:34 Jeez at least use peppermint oil. I'm not one of those crazy people who thinks essential oils can cure all illnesses but they have their place. For a mild headache I'll pull out the peppermint oil before trying a painkiller.

6900 2018-03-17 23:29:49 I think I may try the oil itself and see how it goes. I know it at least helps a little with the pain, so it wouldn't be a waste.
6901 2018-03-17 23:29:49 I have my little oil pen lol & I feel like Fortnite is sorta cheep b/c you make shit to survive unlike how PUBG is straight forward but they got doodoo graphics
6902 2018-03-17 23:29:34 Then you can shape patties, if they seem to fall apart you can add breadcrumbs or flour (I used corn breadcrumbs so it was also gf). Fry with a little of coconut/vegetable oil or bake in oven.

6905 2018-03-17 23:29:21 Can’t haul a portable gen set, welder and tools in a Prius. Some of us need real vehicles i.e. pickup trucks to do their jobs. Solution to price gauging at the pumps is less taxation and pipelines to Alberta to transport in cheaper, cleaner, ethical oil.

6907 2018-03-17 23:29:03 That’s fair. I think that if Trump is serious about punishing Russia, he’d have a better time at it if he was able to cut Gazprom off from the oil market and infiltrate the culture like Reagan/Thatcher.

I was very confused, until I realized she was pointedly tapping the word  VIRGIN in the  coconut oil description.

6929 2018-03-17 23:27:35 I got about 10 today. I just deleted the conversation. However, I now I am having a block party for them.
6930 2018-03-17 23:27:29 The argument for independence is more than oil.
6931 2018-03-17 23:27:29 Yes, Alberta's premier. And, she should absolutely speak to why someone who played a crucial role in bringing together a consensus to deescalate disproportionate conflict about oil sands is now manning the barricades in BC.
6932 2018-03-17 23:27:25 Oil extractors talk about who's winning a PR war while protestors/tectors speak of loss of clean and safe waters, destruction of lands and basic human rights. #OpticIllusion

6963 2018-03-17 23:22:43 Not going east! In the east they bring  in dirty Saudi Oil.
6964 2018-03-17 23:22:42 We have no problem killing or assisting others in the killing of Muslims.  Is it still about oil.
6965 2018-03-17 23:22:36 Not a good comparison, they depend mostly on oil and inported labour.
6966 2018-03-17 23:22:26 i finally got an oil change!
6967 2018-03-17 23:22:15 He got it wrong, but lets not kid ourselves into thinking we had any chance of winning it anyway, like he pointed out, it's not the first time it's happened either, won 2 trophies in his first season and we are a confortable 2nd now to a freak oil money team, best man for the job
6968 2018-03-17 23:22:03 いってらっしゃいませ～
6969 2018-03-17 23:22:03 Thank you British Empire to draw borders afterwards to give you oil and us peace. Or so.

6973 2018-03-17 23:21:15 is it sad that i’ve never used oil paints before
6974 2018-03-17 23:21:13 We need psychological profiles of American Voters please.
Why do you need them?
For selling oil. Only for selling oil.
6975 2018-03-17 23:21:03 Bovine excrement my friend! The oil industry is subsidized by you and me to the tune of billions of dollars a year. We sure could use those billions for roads schools heath care so on.

6978 2018-03-17 23:20:00 Especially when you go to Manitoba or other such place and see how devastatingly poor the native communities are, you realize how beneficial the oil industry is to the BC and Alberta tribes.
6979 2018-03-17 23:19:46 yeah, that would be best, but you have all these different products - pre-rolled, edibles, kief, shatter, vax, oil... and all that is mostly plastic, it come pre-packaged or something, but it's not just the bud

6981 2018-03-17 23:19:19 @realDonaldTrump thought that Tillerson was going to help get in on the Russian oil industry. Why else would he ever have hired him. Thank God Tillerson had some morals unlike DJT
6982 2018-03-17 23:19:10 Ok, and by that logic if they were proposed a miracle cure all by a snake oil salesman they’d buy it.

Not to mention dropping bobby pins in my keyboard. And not telling me about it.
And another broken flute which needs repair.

7005 2018-03-17 23:15:19 These mechanic companies really be getting over on people when it comes to oil changes. They charge like $50-$120 for a damn change, I did mine myself yesterday for a total of $20, that’s with Synthetic oil too, and I replaced my air filter as well

7018 2018-03-17 23:14:01 That oil isn’t for us. It’s for Alberta’s coffers and its oil for Asia. We will still import our oil. It provides 200 jobs after the pipeline is crushed through thousands of creeks and rivers. Then to be shipped through bc pristine waters to Asia.

Wonder where the rest of the oil wealth went? 
Panama???
7026 2018-03-17 23:12:31 Sigh - no. Tight oil is far less expensive to produce. I think you will find research can be your friend.

7029 2018-03-17 23:11:55 Clean with vinegar from a spray bottle then lightly apply olive oil with a soft towel and with the grain of the metal.  I kid you not, it works!  (Unless you have a dog like me that licks the olive oil after its on!)
7030 2018-03-17 23:11:47 Now what would a Russian oil company need US voter data for in 2014 + 2015!? Were they trying to get sanctions lifted by attempting to sway the opinions of US voters without them knowing it!?
7031 2018-03-17 23:11:32 @FoxNewsSunday our country can produce 41% more oil  just by converting coal into oil  which is not new in WW11 this process was perfected . one plant can do this for this nation  , best location is where once a coal generating plant was before OBAMA closed it

7039 2018-03-17 23:10:29 Also, there's a bit of a difference between a communist country in South America for whom oil makes up 95% of their exports and a liberal western democracy in Europe for whom oil makes up around 10% of exports. Argument for independence stretches far beyond oil.

7044 2018-03-17 23:09:35 Ok, so we agree the oil markets, over which Alberta has no control and never will have even a tiny measure of control, destroyed those jobs.
7045 2018-03-17 23:09:22 I don't care if we're broke. At least we'd be out of the bear pit.
Anyway, where's the oil going? You syphoning it off???? 
7046 2018-03-17 23:09:22 Saudi already nationalized foreign ownership of their oil once ... WHAT KIND OF MORON would BUY it again ... so after the next arab spring uprising the people can NATIONALIZE IT AGAIN??

7106 2018-03-17 23:00:24 You have been show proof. You're just too stupid to accept you were duped by a snake oil salesman.
7107 2018-03-17 23:00:20 @RonJichardson did that P. Oil work by the way? Remembered it from your show and now I’m in the same boat

7109 2018-03-17 23:00:06 Further, the statement "these offline variables don’t have any predictive power when predicting personality traits" is full of so many holes you could drive a Russian oil tanker through them. Is psychology a thing? Do people make emotional decisions? Does advertising work ever?

7121 2018-03-17 22:58:41 Bush w is a warmonger also! He bombed Iraq over a lie! The real reason the USA bombs these nations is they are trying to sell their oil outside of the US dollar! They’d rather have a gold backed currency! And that is the reason for bush w & Obama & trump wars!

7125 2018-03-17 22:58:27 Yeah, my book specifically says that "infused storebought oil is likely bull". So hopefully roughly  chopping the garlic, frying it and then straining it will work. Because I really don't want any of us to give up garlic 
7126 2018-03-17 22:58:23 Thank you for sharing what a wonderful chart.

7129 2018-03-17 22:58:08 That would take quite a bit of oil.
Also make them very hard to squeeze
7130 2018-03-17 22:58:04 Can’t trust this system. Must stick with CBD oil and stem cells. 
7131 2018-03-17 22:58:02 We'll have to agree to differ. The end of steam on the railways in the late 60s reduced demand by half. Electric, oil & gas central heating put an end to home use in the 70s. It left UK production four or five times the demand. You can't blame Thatcher for that. It's progress.
7132 2018-03-17 22:57:40 Why do men look at me funny when I’m checking my oil or putting air in the tires?
7133 2018-03-17 22:57:39 That's what happens when you get oil from your vehicle on the ground then the sun hits it a little bit 
7134 2018-03-17 22:57:35 @MariaBartiromo our country can produce oil from coal one plant will increase oil production 41%  with one plant operating . creates oil and coal jobs  not just that the market will go for this in big way because it is new.
7135 2018-03-17 22:57:31 then who are mr. Alexey Miller and mr. Igor Sechin? they run two of Russia's major state-controlled gas and oil companies, by the way.

7139 2018-03-17 22:56:47 Meanwhile, Scotland found oil and became the ragged trousered philanthropist of petroleum economies!
7140 2018-03-17 22:56:38 And I suppose Ralph Klein never made any of his oil buddies rich?

7147 2018-03-17 22:56:10 Educate your child using your money for that child to be a med doc and then repeat that statement again. 8 yrs in total training needs to compensated well. The Cuban doctors will be here in exchange of oil. It is not free service.
7148 2018-03-17 22:56:07 I wouldn't even consider UAE a Muslim county it's more of a white country these days all this oil has gassed them
7149 2018-03-17 22:56:04 By that thinking God also put oil in the ground for us to extract and make our lives comfortable.
7150 2018-03-17 22:55:57 Got you on that oil plug
7151 2018-03-17 22:55:57 Hauling oil by rail is ok but shipping by pipeline is better. Would free up capacity to move grain to port and help prairie farmers. Let's use some common sense and get the pipeline done.
7152 2018-03-17 22:55:20 I miss working on cars everyday  the smell of oil 
7153 2018-03-17 22:55:11 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

7155 2018-03-17 22:54:48 Cutting oil stink is the smell of progress.
7156 2018-03-17 22:54:46 And I can kinda of understand that they don't want a new pipeline but do people realize kinder Morgan transports the product, not produce.   So no pipeline doesn't mean less oil just means more rail delivery and diesel trucks delivering which seems more harmful to me but ???
7157 2018-03-17 22:53:28 Your oil spill is still in your old parking spot
7158 2018-03-17 22:53:22 Then you will not watch @ManUtd any time soon.
7159 2018-03-17 22:53:14 Dale watched as Falco got the oil, the poor guy looked a little worried. It wasn't surprising, Dale wasn't exactly small, and nodding to Falco's request he teased down his boxer shorts, kicking them aside. His thick shaft now free, it was a sight to truly behold..
7160 2018-03-17 22:52:59 Take Black Seed oil!! It has 101 benefits. One of the Best decisions I’ve made in a long time.

7163 2018-03-17 22:52:51 Yep, character of a snake oil salesman shining through.
7164 2018-03-17 22:52:33 Not for money. Not for oil!
7165 2018-03-17 22:52:21 While both are important on different levels for different reasons, its troubling that US, especially the media, is far more concerned with what Russian Govt is doing on Facebook that what they are doing with chemical weapons, proxy wars, and oil/gas manipulation of Europe.
7166 2018-03-17 22:52:20 If they’re so worried about the pipeline How come there so much sewage oil crap along the shores of BC   watch CBC you’ll see it all   let’s wake up people and smell the coffee
7167 2018-03-17 22:51:48 Pulled across the highway.  Thought to myself hey this is the field that I blew that fluky O ring on the hydraulic pump last year on a Saturday night.  30 minutes later looks at pump.  Shooting oil all over out of the same o ring.  What are the chances?

I am only mentionning those killed by the rebels. No mention of those killed by Daesh in alQadam and Deir Ezzor near the oil plant.
7170 2018-03-17 22:51:30 royalties mean we are all oil profiteers. More flow means more $ for you and all that it buys roads schools health care and so on.  #KinderMorgan
7171 2018-03-17 22:51:27 They are used to burn essential oils. The diffusers disseminate the oil into the air. There are different types of oils for different purposes. Some are relaxing, some are invigorating, some are for passion etc. I most use them 30 minutes before bed to help me relax

7176 2018-03-17 22:50:25 @FairQuestions Absolutely,  if our oil can't get to market more sales for them, smart move.
7177 2018-03-17 22:50:05 If they like let them increase it to 1000 per liter,Time will come when this oil will become unwanted resources in our hands,so far there is about 2.9million electrical cars been produce in the world,our leaders knows this that is why their kids n properties r nt in naija.

7178 2018-03-17 22:49:38 Because the book specifically says that infused storebought oil might not be the real thing. So I just want to check.
7179 2018-03-17 22:48:52 It’s simple.  Egg into a jar. Salt, pepper, garlic, lemon juice. Then 1 cup of avocado oil.  Blend.
7180 2018-03-17 22:48:45 Oil co’s have their own private CIAs…
7181 2018-03-17 22:48:42 @Zak_Bagans Question-did anyone get the oil drippings from the blinds tested?
7182 2018-03-17 22:48:41 Civilized people respect the law. Cozying up to US oil interests gives BC zero credibility. American oil tankers out of Washington and not a peep. Saudi oil into east coast and NOT A PEEP.
7183 2018-03-17 22:48:24 my first scrub had the same problem and basically what i’ve learned from that is never listen to recipes online bc they all are made by weirdos who love to slather oil all over their weird faces and bodies and don’t want to claw their skin off bc of it
7184 2018-03-17 22:48:23 Lmao. I saw your position. I hope you find Oil 
7185 2018-03-17 22:48:18 Hint: it was flooded centuries before we started burning oil in any capacity. Another hint: Its now called Climate change, not global warming.

7187 2018-03-17 22:48:11 Didn’t he have to put his assets in a blind trust and promise not to work for the oil industry for 10 years after he left the job? You can think he was 1 of the worst Sec of States in history, & he damaged the State Dept for a generation, but his motives were probably honorable.

7189 2018-03-17 22:47:47 Do you buy the infused oil or did you make it?
7190 2018-03-17 22:47:40 Both need a oil change
7191 2018-03-17 22:47:15 i wound up blending a shitload of aloe gel into it to balance it out and it turned out fantastic but this has been several “oh gooodddd ick oil too oily gross gross gross” attempts along before getting to like. good and not miserable
7192 2018-03-17 22:47:14 I need a massage. Like a full body one, oil and all lol
7193 2018-03-17 22:47:10 Last time, oil sanctions only halved the exports because China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea were exempt importers but at a quota. That said, no restrictions were placed on gas condensates because it wasn’t classed as crude oil.
7194 2018-03-17 22:46:58 Europe getting the oil is the axis on Saturday morning talk shows spending.
7195 2018-03-17 22:46:52 Blacks didn't even know about the minerals and oil etc they were sitting on. White rule is great for blacks - look at black population growth under apartheid.
7196 2018-03-17 22:46:24 Chronic headaches and migraines really suck. I was super excited after taking CBD oil cause I thought I had finally found something that worked, but it seems to have just been a fluke?

7200 2018-03-17 22:45:12 Oh, I agree the seizure laws in this country violate the 4th Amendment. I don’t think those guys deserved that. But their business model is about allowing others to sell financial snake oil. They’re operating in the gray area where others operate with far fewer scruples.

7211 2018-03-17 22:42:55 The revelation for me was that Brussel sprouts need not be boiled to nastiness. Tossed w olive oil & salt and lightly broiled they’re great.

7239 2018-03-17 22:38:22 Someone needs to ask her if she prefers RUSSIAN oil and gas. Does Gazprom sound better to her than helping our British allies with Canadian gas and oil so they can avoid dependency on Russia?

7245 2018-03-17 22:36:56 I’m not an opponent of Scotland, I love my country.The reason the oil companies are making more money now is through efficiencies forced by low oil price. Now price up a little they make more profits. Shale oil costs less than N sea. Fact. As is the deficit I’m afraid.
7246 2018-03-17 22:36:54 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator!

7250 2018-03-17 22:35:44 It will depend on the scope of the sanctions and which parties agree with it. Right now it seems like sanctions are targeting specific individuals. No mention yet of oil sanctions, is there? If US is alone without UN, very few will acknowledge it. Coalition Of The Billing.
7251 2018-03-17 22:35:39 ...and the first activity should take precedence over the second...it should be ...becasue at the end of it ..the tounge decide the mood :) 

O btw, is it a "Masala Dosa" or "plain dosa" or some other popular variant?? 

I used had ,less oil roasted dosa with chatni and sambar..

We consistently do not vote Tory but......they're rancid. Why stay. As for the oil.....don't go there!!!
7255 2018-03-17 22:34:47 Yeah, I know what good RSO can do, but how can you have a 1.5g of THC in 1g of oil?

7257 2018-03-17 22:34:06 Get your saturday on with 4 grams of AVO oil!
7258 2018-03-17 22:34:03 I was just about to drop the oil out of my snowblower and then my neighbor walked by and convinced me it might be too early for that jazz.

7269 2018-03-17 22:32:06 You right.  We do it all the time.  Oil spill clambake mardi gras and many other parties happen year over year, rape free. (And yes, some don't)

When you bring pretty women around niggas not used to pretty women...
7270 2018-03-17 22:31:52 this oil down smells so damn good
7271 2018-03-17 22:31:41 Noam Chomsky is probably worse.
7272 2018-03-17 22:31:22 Hopefully it will generate a lot of revenue for Kano state so they don't have to rely on VAT from alcohol and the federal oil based budget. Nonsense!
7273 2018-03-17 22:31:21 Let's forget that over a million killed in Iraq by Americans for oil and the threat of the Euro being the most used currency in the world, but hey the US has free speech and political correctness so that means they're the heroes right?
7274 2018-03-17 22:31:13 Where's Donochio going to get his snake oil from now?
7275 2018-03-17 22:30:54 I remember trying out a coconut oil & sugar face mask and it was so uncomfortable. ..
7276 2018-03-17 22:30:53 Is safer way of transporting petroleum, obviously. Can you in good conscience really say that mobile transportation of oil by Truck, Train or Ship is any better. At this point oil is a necessity for us and a stationary pipeline is the safest option.
7277 2018-03-17 22:30:38 I’ve added, thyme, rosemary , Garlic, to my saltbush ,pink salt and olive oil infused shoulder of lamb ( Rodger donated this shoulder) There are only Rodger chops left.
7278 2018-03-17 22:30:36 What do you use to keep your beard from itching? I use beard oil but sometimes it doesn’t seem to do a whole lot in that sense.
7279 2018-03-17 22:30:36 Estimated oil price changes next week:
Diesel, 30-40c/liter 
Gasoline, 0-10c/liter 
Kerosene, 50-60c/liter 
7280 2018-03-17 22:30:29 me, biting into fish oil pills: surely this poor man's caviar will cure my Depression
7281 2018-03-17 22:30:22 No I haven't for described reasons traded markets like : gold, dax, hsf. On no trading platform. Only oil but I gave up because it is so thin and "stressy". Nothing I like.
7282 2018-03-17 22:30:20 I need some help! I post about having a clean environment then I find out that individuals who have been treating me and my family horribly are getting funds from Big Oil in the form of a donation for poor people, but are not receiving The $$$
7283 2018-03-17 22:30:12 Its bn over 3 years I read their stories,but yesterday ppl were just hypercomenting,so I decided to read,n I even asked oomf if it was real cos I dnt bliv
7284 2018-03-17 22:30:09 Reheat your French Fries in a cast iron skillet with a bit of oil for maximum crunchiness. When you take them out and while they’re still hot, add some salt for more flavor!
7285 2018-03-17 22:29:58 Oh no it isn't.  What is it you don't like Lowest unemployment in 17 years, 2 million fewer on food stamps, lowest unemployment app. in 45 years, three straight quarters of avg. 3% economic growth, largest tax cut in over thirty years, now exporting more oil than we import, more
7286 2018-03-17 22:29:03 Hi!! Thanks so much for grabbing a jar. Yes it should absolutely be safe. The oil may be from us filling the jars.  If the seal on the side was intact it should be good to go!
7287 2018-03-17 22:29:01 Girl scout cookies among other awesome things, are also using sustainable palm oil. I love these young ladies!! (And their cookies, and the company who makes their cookies.) (And their cookies.) #girlscoutcookies
7288 2018-03-17 22:28:42 今日は仲村芽衣子さんの誕生日。めでたい
7289 2018-03-17 22:28:33 Sadly, the Oil would have to take Bobby Ryan and his anchor contract too.
7290 2018-03-17 22:28:33 Digo: en Europa sí aumenta algo, no lo compran.
¿Si NO comparamos NADA a Oil Combustibles?
7291 2018-03-17 22:28:21 Well this is my point that it will be shipped one way or another. Not a good thing necessarily but a massive derailment in the Rocky Mountains would be as terrible as an oil tanker leak, maybe worse.
7292 2018-03-17 22:28:14 Ok we will accept this but answer me about some other questions..
Foreign debts..?
Foreign investment..?
Exports..?
Imports..?
Currency value..?
Oil prices..?
Corruption case..?
Ahad cheema..?
Paragon...?
Laptop..?
Qatri latter..?
Calibri..?
Education level..?
Health level..?
7293 2018-03-17 22:27:54 芽衣子さん、お誕生日おめでとうございます。この一年のご活躍楽しみにしています(*^-^*)

7295 2018-03-17 22:27:34 While oil tankers leave Washington state. Makes perfect sense.
7296 2018-03-17 22:27:16 Circle jerk?
7297 2018-03-17 22:26:50 I have a better idea for the Oil. Deal Puljujarvi + 1st rounder + prospect for Erik Karlsson.
7298 2018-03-17 22:26:44 Did he walk? Or did he use oil and gas to get there like the rest of you hypocrites? 
7299 2018-03-17 22:26:25 Put them in the hot oil, pre frying
7300 2018-03-17 22:26:22 何があるか当てるの激ムズだからね()
7301 2018-03-17 22:26:19 “Liberal activists” have been backing huge job growth by supporting the creation of a renewable energy infrastructure. Solar employs more that oil, solar and wind employ more than fossil fuel and are growing

7303 2018-03-17 22:26:12 Dorado oil is on sale today! Normally a $25 gram is on sale for $15 today!
7304 2018-03-17 22:26:10 Given the current demand for snake oil, snakes may be extinct within 20 years.
7305 2018-03-17 22:26:06 So which is it to be?  Yes to royalties and any other taxes on oil, or no to them all?
7306 2018-03-17 22:25:54 @bdleblanc the Oil helped us out, the Kings are dead to me, so you’re up next! Let’s go Canes!! #cbj
7307 2018-03-17 22:25:49 Get the flour and oil and make your own, it ain’t that hard.
I do like their pork Tasso though, use it in all my beans.
7308 2018-03-17 22:25:46 God bless you.. I tried putting this on table while I was going through the diary but I later disagree. The statistics is so unbalanced
7309 2018-03-17 22:25:43 i would totally drink a glug of the best olive oil though come to think of it and now i kind of do want to take a bite out of a truffle
7310 2018-03-17 22:25:39 I’ve never seen a feminist change their own oil.
7311 2018-03-17 22:25:37 This tea tree oil shampoo & conditioner I been using got my hair so soft & smooth I love it
7312 2018-03-17 22:25:18 Well if it still is we will have to get rid of it. Wouldnt want it to interfere in oil and gas industry work.
7313 2018-03-17 22:25:08 たまにGORILLA乱用やめれ
7314 2018-03-17 22:24:59 I will look into the olive oil option again and ditch the canola.
7315 2018-03-17 22:24:55 I believe, he is referring to Communist related killings only. Oil related will be another figure to add-on.
7316 2018-03-17 22:24:48 Also. Try before bed getting a bowl full of steamy water and throw some olbas oil or vix. Troop through the stingy feeling but you’ll be clear x
7317 2018-03-17 22:24:44 If you mean a truffle as in the fungus... WHY? They are *not* pleasant on their own. Far too rich and a very weird texture. It's a bit like wanting to drink "the best extra virgin olive oil".
7318 2018-03-17 22:24:23 Fill containers with oil and ship away. Problem solved.
7319 2018-03-17 22:24:20 Comrade Khanna, you know that the oligarchy would never go for that. You need to stay out of their way so they can protect us by killing more brown and black people for oil.
7320 2018-03-17 22:24:06 Well my only advice is smell the oil and make sure it doesn't smell burnt, and go to 4k rpm and check how efficiently it shifts..goodluck
7321 2018-03-17 22:24:04 10,800 barrels of oil; and, when it was no reason to fear me, as yet undiscovered prime thing in anybody but himself.
7322 2018-03-17 22:23:58 Happy to hear it was more nuanced in delivery, as Washington State’s 1,500 oil tankers a year into Salish Sea are a bit of a conundrum if he’s claiming to be a climate warrior.
7323 2018-03-17 22:23:44 My horse is drinking Throughbred Red beer...
While listening to Toby Keith:"Beer for my horses"
7324 2018-03-17 22:23:34 Does look like a bit of an oil slick. I'm amazed one Otter could do that 
7325 2018-03-17 22:23:13 @BuenasBrand i was so psyched to try your products, and I even I went back and bought the last jar of chimichurri this afternoon! But one of the (sealed) jars had a little oil on it when I got home...a leak? Still safe?
7326 2018-03-17 22:23:12 so last night i made supervisor in the oil fields, blessed 
7327 2018-03-17 22:23:03 Pruitt is a self serving arrogant grifter. His exorbitant travel expenses are the least of his evil doings...now serving as a welcome distraction. He and Zinke are working like a well oiled team. Just follow the oil slick.
7328 2018-03-17 22:22:57 いや、それなって失礼だわㅎㅎ
7329 2018-03-17 22:22:40 I wish #bcpoli #cdnpoli would wake up & out the Trans Mountain pipeline in so BC could buy cheaper AB oil instead of shipping it up the coast from the US at higher prices. It's dumb all around not approving it.

7331 2018-03-17 22:22:33 Coconut oil is such a red flag ! Ew it gave me some serious acne
7332 2018-03-17 22:22:22 Did u give him cannabis oil yet x
7333 2018-03-17 22:22:16 Zade will do anything to pass of those last few cases of 'Ol' Zepfram's Smudging Oil'...
7334 2018-03-17 22:22:14 this is why universal is best park

vegetable oil > being mangled in horrible machinery
7335 2018-03-17 22:22:03 It’s not an economic recovery if you are just waiting for the price of oil to go up... got any other ideas? Just go. #yourembarrassingyourself
7336 2018-03-17 22:21:38 My understanding is, in addition to what is shipped through pipelines, #KinderMorgan owns roughly 210,000 barrels/day of rail capacity out of a terminal in Edmonton, Alta. however they won't divulge recent shipping volumes. Oil is shipped to West Coast to reach Asian markets.

7340 2018-03-17 22:21:14 K
7341 2018-03-17 22:21:12 Anybody looking for a job, Temecula olive oil company is hiring in old town San Diego.
7342 2018-03-17 22:21:12 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
7343 2018-03-17 22:21:10 Baby shampoo or coconut oil or micellar water
7344 2018-03-17 22:20:50 lol I would start changing my oil just to find out my car takes 6 quarts when I only have 5
7345 2018-03-17 22:20:46 it’s synthetic oil
7346 2018-03-17 22:20:35 none of them involve vegetable oil tho
7347 2018-03-17 22:20:34 as he would frame the point. Oddly, he works in a province where the economy has primarily run of taxes on oil under his party's banner for about 40 years. I refer to royalties on oil which are nothing but a tax.
7348 2018-03-17 22:20:32 Thank God for tea tree oil
7349 2018-03-17 22:20:28 Yes the statistics of age,graduation, marriage,from the boy and lady's secondary school days till the incident won't work out
7350 2018-03-17 22:20:25 How much does the company that extracts the oil get 
7351 2018-03-17 22:20:08 I'm all for discussion.  If no new pipeline is built the oil will be shipped by rail and truck.  Both of which is more carbon intense and dangerous.  A new pipeline is most cost effective and better for environment.    How do you see oil getting to market with no pipeline
7352 2018-03-17 22:20:08 Don’t use mineral spirits if it’s oil cause after washing minerals spirits can get into your ear drums causing much pain if latex wash it with soap
7353 2018-03-17 22:19:51 Unknown reason?! Money, Oil, etc
7354 2018-03-17 22:19:45 Cuz who doesn't wanna drive thru miles and miles and miles and miles of tumbleweeds and oil well pumps.
7355 2018-03-17 22:19:45 I never watch the news, or read a paper...all propaganda. It’s all about oil, money and power of them both! One family runs the planet 
7356 2018-03-17 22:19:38 Get some Black Seed Oil, it cures everything! You have a cold? Black Seed Oil. Hair falling out? Black Seed Oil. Face breaking out? Black Seed Oil!
7357 2018-03-17 22:19:22 Ugh, oil painting is so tedious, and it doesn’t help that all of my homework assignments are transcriptions of other paintings rather than anything original.
7358 2018-03-17 22:19:14 oye y Experto Augusto Tandazo cuenta en el video que él es abogado de Dygoil, la empresa que junto a Gente Oil (la que dirige la hija de Wilson Pastor) recibió la concesión del campo Singue?
7359 2018-03-17 22:18:59 気にしてはいないですよw
ただわざとって言ってるのが謎ですけどね...
7360 2018-03-17 22:18:52 And the next tin na knife,then her father was the boys senior,he spoilt the boy,at what age did her dad got married, gave birth to her,She grew up,and the guy just graduated from sec sch n uni,n she also served,cmon the statistics does not conform
7361 2018-03-17 22:18:50 @ACLU The American military smelled I was frying onion rigs and kicked down my door and stole my canola oil and called my dog dumb looking please respond.
7362 2018-03-17 22:18:49 I've given myself so many warm oil treatments on my ear lobes and BISH I AM HYDRATED. this is the healthiest they've ever been, yas
7363 2018-03-17 22:18:35 Do U think U made Alaska a better place by voting for the tax bill that undermines healthcare for many Americans and opens the Arctic to oil drilling?
7364 2018-03-17 22:18:17 Cbd oil some good stuff
7365 2018-03-17 22:18:15 hmmm that’s so weird. maybe invest in organic soap? Or use tea tree oil washes!
7366 2018-03-17 22:18:02 I have some for watercolour and oil paint textures and manga/comic panels etc
7367 2018-03-17 22:18:00 #BattleOfBritain From 15 May 1940 a night bomber campaign was launched against the German oil industry, communications and forest/crops
7368 2018-03-17 22:17:52 And of course you don't use any oil products ever right?
7369 2018-03-17 22:17:46 วันสุดท้ายแล้วโว้ย
7370 2018-03-17 22:17:45 That coconut oil rub down after a hot shower be life bro
7371 2018-03-17 22:17:41 Maybe you should consider correcting your tweet as it's not nice to spread wrong info like this. I don't know if you speak Spanish, if you don't just find someone that does and you'll get the confirmation of what I just wrote. Salam
7372 2018-03-17 22:17:40 Thank you!! I don't view it as walking out on the kids I see it as walking out FOR the kids. The funding for education has dropped in this state 28% in the last few years. The oil companies are getting all of the breaks. The GPT here is 2-3%. The lowest in the nation!
7373 2018-03-17 22:17:38 Your thoughts are excellent Mike! You are completely right. The problem is each group suffers from "confirmation bias".  Your response in defence of a poke at the right suggests you are either right-wing or looking for truth. Jason was whinging about carbon tax, a tax on oil
7374 2018-03-17 22:17:34 Texas supply’s oil careers more than any other state. Cali has Hollywood, and rich people.
7375 2018-03-17 22:17:33 Oil base or Latex ??
7376 2018-03-17 22:17:29 2nd time at big bar. 2nd time getting kicked out. Oil and vinegar
7377 2018-03-17 22:17:22 They'll have to invade a different household first and take their oil.
7378 2018-03-17 22:17:12 @caveofbeauty what do you think of bio oil for scarring?
7379 2018-03-17 22:17:05 They should all go home and think about the real problem all the plastic found in our oceans never mind about oil flowing in a safe pipe line
7380 2018-03-17 22:17:04 どうしてかい()
7381 2018-03-17 22:16:46 It's either or. So, Murphy's oil can build up. Not great for floors.
7382 2018-03-17 22:16:35 What does beard oil smell like
7383 2018-03-17 22:16:30 Oh my lord I’ll show you some pics next week I have. 1.4 MGW oil boiler back up and 2  500kw fan dryers in now there was a lot of room still love it it’s all my HEAD design on pipework that’s how I like to put it. Ha ha
7384 2018-03-17 22:16:26 こちらこそ、フォロバと、いいねとリツありがとうございますわあー！はい！嬉しすぎますなんて呼べばいいですか？
7385 2018-03-17 22:16:22 Better to be in Calgary than in other countries. The oil produced in Canada pays royalties and taxes to the government and provides jobs for Canadians. Oil from other countries do not.  You are likely a Russian where all oil is owned by Putin and his friends.
7386 2018-03-17 22:16:12 Great caption for the horse meme
7387 2018-03-17 22:15:47 The oil companies polluting the land, air and sea for profit, right?
7388 2018-03-17 22:15:44 ayurvedik tıpta Oil pulling diye birşey var, biraz uzun vadede çözüm sağlıyor ama pek çok şeye faydası olduğu gibi, alerjileri de rahatlatıyor, bi deneyebilirsin bence, kan grubun ne?
7389 2018-03-17 22:15:38 Senti te...io sono nato antifascista ed anticomunista...e ti dirò, fino a poco tempo fa abboccavo anche io al neo maccartismo imperante. Poi ho capito che per l'oil&gas l'occidente "civile" é disposto a fare rinascere addirittura il nazismo o assoldare tagliagole islamisti
7390 2018-03-17 22:15:30 You know it’s SXSW when the smell of beard oil and cheap weed overwhelms you stepping outside downtown.
7391 2018-03-17 22:15:28 Clever!  But I have good avocado oil. Not that veggie oil nonsense.
7392 2018-03-17 22:15:26 There will be no slingshot until the Liberals are out of government and someone with kahunas puts in the pipeline to the west coast. If this happens we will be oil and gas kings and the US will no longer matter!
7393 2018-03-17 22:15:26 おじぎにね(真顔)そそなどんどんどん
7394 2018-03-17 22:15:25 Uber, but for oil heaters.

All staff/cabinet changes mean Trump learned how to play the game

7417 2018-03-17 22:11:52 PLEASE add that some/most of those oils NEED to be in a carrier oil as to not fuck ul the skin. I know this seems like it’s common knowledge, but it’s not
7418 2018-03-17 22:11:45 Enough about the Carbon tax rants. All you ever did was ride an oil boom and then quit when you couldn't balance the books. Great legacy.

7421 2018-03-17 22:10:47 the battles look like you're playing on an RL diorama where it was cut out and painted. The best thing for this game would be sort of a soft watercolor or oil painting aesthetic for battlefields, but it made really good use of limited hardware.
7422 2018-03-17 22:10:41 The Oil would be lucky to flip Nuge for Hoffman. McDavid setting Hoffman up over 82 games would be scary. Hoff instantly becomes a 40+ goal player and Edmonton wins more games.

7436 2018-03-17 22:08:32 Anybody who hasn’t used any oil or gas products in the last 50 years may sue. Everybody else just STFU.

I can't find it on the site, I was sure I'd done it but never mind here it is
175g oil, 175g of sugar, 3 beaten eggs 2medium carrots grated, rind of one orange grated keeping the orange, mix eggs oil &sugar into a bowl or large jug, add the carrot and orange rind and mix

7439 2018-03-17 22:08:03 You know what I want to know: who discovered popcorn? Like, who found these corn kernels and thought, all they need now is some oil and a very high heat?!
7440 2018-03-17 22:07:58 Hi Karen. Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t have sufficient oil?
7441 2018-03-17 22:07:48 Canada should be interested too. I read a great Rueters article showing that much of the Koch fortune came from undermining Canadian oil refining - forcing Canadian crude to be sent to Koch refineries. Indirectly Tar Sands are now funding the Koch/Putin/Trump Coup d'etat.
7442 2018-03-17 22:07:43 Cause mobile oil transportation like trucks, trains and ships are somehow safer?!

7446 2018-03-17 22:07:04 Obama targeted the PRICE of oil.  Russia needed 100 a barrel to balance it's budget.  It went down to 40.  Obama asked the Saudi's to pump more oil..... they did.

7451 2018-03-17 22:06:27 I am totally against THC, however,150 years ago cannabis oil was used to heal a plethora of ills including some forms of  cancer. The AMA and FDA don't want any cheap cures on the market place.
7452 2018-03-17 22:05:56 Note to self pt 2: when doing laundry, check all pockets and DO NOT have chap stick go through the dryer. (It ruins your shirts...leaving them with oil stains btw)
7453 2018-03-17 22:05:43 Reading these arm chair protesters skewed perceptions of pipelines and the oil sands makes me wonder why anyone takes them seriously. You're all clearly misinformed. Canada is among the best in the world when it comes to environmentally concious pipeline construction #stopKM
7454 2018-03-17 22:05:34 Yah, but they still drive gas guzzling vehicles. Do you have any idea how many items in an average home are/or contain petroleum based products?! It will be a couple hundreds years before we are completely able to live without oil as a society.
7455 2018-03-17 22:05:28 Oil based cleansers and those makeup removing towels!!
7456 2018-03-17 22:05:25 My old 740 started to lose 3rd (used to jump out under power unless shifter held in place) but it was fixed by a gearbox oil change. Syncro remained a little crunchy though.
7457 2018-03-17 22:05:24 Missed your video, sorry. Norway does have an oil fund. But they have less people than Scotland. And charge £9 per pint. In any case, that ship has sailed. Now when oil gets to $70 US just ramp up shale production. So Salmond’s $113 was utter lies

7462 2018-03-17 22:04:34 But you didn’t answer my question where does all the oil shipped by train go for export? This is oil not shipped through pipelines; it comes through Ontario presumably for refineries in New Brunswick or the US East Coast.

7488 2018-03-17 22:01:12 This is why we need to focus on renewable energy and not be beholden to the oil and gas lobby- that is where our plastic comes from. This admin is taking us in the opposite direction...

7492 2018-03-17 22:00:37 do you use tea tree oil directly on your face or should it be diluted or anything?!

7497 2018-03-17 21:59:57 A slightly conflicted statement form a man heading a state with many pipelines and refineries and constant oil tanker traffic . 

Has he stopped any fossil fuel infrastructure in his own state?

7501 2018-03-17 21:59:30 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

7509 2018-03-17 21:58:47 She’s 9, we never tried glucosamine, the vet suggested we start it as preventative to future issues but the fish oil pills seem to be where it’s at. She eats them like candy too lol
7510 2018-03-17 21:58:44 Actually, they are a mixed economy too dependent on one resource, too much corruption siphoning money to the elites, and who's debt went into default when the price of oil tanked. Bingo! Hyperinflation.

People throwing bags of shit at each other.
7543 2018-03-17 21:53:01 I didn’t notice that on crude oil. I did notice it on the daily Dow chart. YM  and CL look just alike. That is a continuation pattern. It entered the wedge on the downside so it should exit in that direction?
7544 2018-03-17 21:53:00 THANK YOU!  I did not know this.  While I haven't read all citations I plan to, and think it's a good topic for contacting elected reps.  Have heard of this issue around Oakland & Richmond, Ca. (oil refineries).
7545 2018-03-17 21:52:32 Supposed to say buying the snake oil.   Don't get the autocorrect here!
7546 2018-03-17 21:52:27 With coconut oil——unrefined
7547 2018-03-17 21:52:25 When Gadafi took over in Libya, oil prod. plunged to 1 MMbbls/d. Analysts said Gadafi would soon fall as a result, they said "Libya cannot survive with 1 MMbbls/d". ONLY 1 analyst read the situation correctly (British): "Libya can't BUT Gadafi can and will... ". Rest is history.
7548 2018-03-17 21:52:25 Other countries are stealing crude oil we are stealing each other's crisis 
7549 2018-03-17 21:52:12 Friendship and money are like oil and water
7550 2018-03-17 21:52:09 Tea tree oil and the most offensive amount of vitamin C
7551 2018-03-17 21:52:05 Target the oil... lifeline of the Russian economy.
7552 2018-03-17 21:51:56 Granted. But how is all the oil shipped by train being put on tankers? I’m all for renewable energy but the oil being produced will be shipped somehow no? Is it all going east? Im asking.
7553 2018-03-17 21:51:55 I'm not deflecting, as I said earlier on, I think we're turning a blind eye to other risks that already exist plus the fact that you continue to consume oil from other countries... through your ports. The record is perfect. We can increase traffic without incident.
7554 2018-03-17 21:51:36 None of this makes any sense to me when they continue to bring oil to market in trains.  What's the point?  Forcing the issue of our sovereignty in this way could lead to massive individual disappointment about our status as a nation.   We don't even own this oil. #VassalState

Me: or I could think in terms of oil and gas
7558 2018-03-17 21:50:59 Trump and reality! are oil and water - it's a character defective..
7559 2018-03-17 21:50:52 The first time I used tea tree oil I wanted to rip my skin off 
7560 2018-03-17 21:50:47 I see the Fake Views are still strong in your eyes. Perhaps - young as you are - you need cataract surgery? Those blind spots can be problematic...
7561 2018-03-17 21:50:40 I Repeat DO NOT place essential oil on your face,  it’s sole purpose is to be burned during aromatherapy (It contains flammable chemicals ! Oil comes in three types, essential, pure, And mixed(With vitamin e or c, You can Apply pure, and mixed to you face but never “essential “
7562 2018-03-17 21:50:35 Mom decided to be "helpful" and start cooking my planned breakfast for me and she put too much oil and now I have an over-oiled rice mess I'm supposed to eat. Fuck
7563 2018-03-17 21:50:32 Best night ever. Me myself and I. A home manicure. A coconut oil hair mask. Lindt chocolate. And all the TV on @ITV #SaturdayNightTakeaway #TheVoiceUK
7564 2018-03-17 21:50:06 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
7565 2018-03-17 21:50:01 The oil sands have proven to only be economically viable under certain circumstances.
7566 2018-03-17 21:48:51 Interesting... we’re just about to launch for the oil industry our wireless prescriptive analytical IOT smart sensors that measure fatigue and predict faults before they happen..unable to stop a cyber attack, but able to measure pipes fatigue enabling a reduction in losses.
7567 2018-03-17 21:48:14 Your deflecting this to be about something else other than oil tankers now. Yes, other ships carry risk but none would have the environmental impact to our coast and all the marine life like an oil spill! #bcpoli #cdnpoli
7568 2018-03-17 21:48:10 Good grief! How does he explain the fact they find fossils millions of years old in said oil? Also, what of dinosaurs?
7569 2018-03-17 21:47:55 Yes. Actually D helped holding the salmon oil while I cleaned their ears and Hegs was ok with the nails.
7570 2018-03-17 21:47:52 The Russians had a small base there. It was natural for Syria to ask for assistance in their conflict. I don't get who invited the US/UK/Turkey into the conflict. Nope the US is there to hold territory (oil fields) and support Nusra and Al Quaeda - also direct ISIS towards SAA.
7571 2018-03-17 21:47:46 No thank you. That statement only becomes valid if your colonial masters return all the oil, gold, copper, diamonds, coffee, tea, sugar, spices, wool, all the artefacts in the 'British Museum' they stole from the world etc etc.
Only then you can make a statement like that :)
7572 2018-03-17 21:47:44 Well I guess if Russia had plenty of oil, they wouldn’t have to spend the money to bust up the Arctic ice.
7573 2018-03-17 21:47:44 It is rather ridiculous b/c as bad as Chiarelli's messed this up, McDavid is plenty good enough to carry one of these groups to a Cup or two. Imagine what might have been.
7574 2018-03-17 21:47:34 using linseed oil instead of turpentine to dilute my paint has lead me to the following realization: the constant headaches while i painted were me and my inability to open a window's own goddamn fault
7575 2018-03-17 21:47:34 That you did. Make sure you boop Zach with the oil. He will love it. 
7576 2018-03-17 21:47:27 Did I say anything about oil companies? No. I'm talking about all the scientists and experts who disagree with the scientists who are getting paid millions to push the climate change paranoia. If scientists can't agree on it, your opinion means nothing.
7577 2018-03-17 21:47:23 Agree it was a disappointing exercise. But what makes you think it impacted SA? For better or worse, SA green groups were never going to support ALP because of its oil and gas stance.
7578 2018-03-17 21:47:15 As a proud mostly Italian I'll have you know we do not in fact sweat pizza grease. I in fact sweat peperoncino oil and I know a guy who cries garlic butter.

7584 2018-03-17 21:46:42 There is no response to your post, Diane. Markets do what markets do. What do you suggest, nationalizing global oil production?
7585 2018-03-17 21:46:35 Oil is exhaustible, so why don't we just stick with the natural source of government funding and police the utilisation of whatever we're contributing more stringently?

7590 2018-03-17 21:45:13 We had a ship that lost power off the Queen Charlotte last summer, we had an unidentified slick on English Bay last week. No sinkings yet, but plenty of incidents! With an increase of 7 times the number of oil tankers proposed, that’s a significant increase in risk! #cdnpoli

7595 2018-03-17 21:43:41 That's all? End wars for oil? I agree, but supporting the round CO2-lie won't help, just wasting money for expensive renewables. There is a much better way. Generation IV nuclear power plants can do that job easily! #NukeWaste2Power #GenIV
7596 2018-03-17 21:43:34 Use the block button. He’s obviously a troll. I’m Australian and I know enough to know that reservations, sterilisation etc were attempts at genocide and even the oil pipeline protested against in 2017 threatened Native Americans.

7608 2018-03-17 21:41:46 I need some sweet almond oil
7609 2018-03-17 21:41:41 It is comical that they used zip ties. The more zip ties used or wasted the more oil needed to make new ones. The circle of life and the stupidity of a few.

7633 2018-03-17 21:39:24 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

7637 2018-03-17 21:38:32 Venezuela has the largest oil resources in the country, and the government foolishly built their economy and budget entirely around oil. This worked very well for a while, but when the oil price collapsed in 2014, so did Venezuela. (1/2)

7660 2018-03-17 21:34:43 TL;DR - oil - store it upside down.
7661 2018-03-17 21:34:30 Now you’re hoping for an earthquake in addition to an oil spill?

7672 2018-03-17 21:32:42 i know!! i used to do castor oil treatments but it got to be too much work lol
7673 2018-03-17 21:32:23 As long as demand for oil is there, supply will come from somewhere; if you blockade, you get it from even worse actors. Just like with drugs. Better to  move to cleaner/safer production and transport, mitigate neg consequences while alternatives develop. Think harm reduction.
7674 2018-03-17 21:32:21 Aside from oil tankers, are there any other cargo ships that carry dangerous, noxious goods? Any of the other 3,000 or so tankers? How many of them require the Port authority to guide them in and out?
7675 2018-03-17 21:32:18 2: certain essential oil/perfume smells, specifically: 
-patchouli
-ylang ylang (also how tf do you pronounce it)
-rose geranium (I’m always disappointed that it’s not actual rose, and it’s weirdly spicy/harsh)

7688 2018-03-17 21:31:15 "Lemme get uhhh.. 0W-20 in conventional oil"
7689 2018-03-17 21:31:15 Oil got me a Bankroll
7690 2018-03-17 21:30:57 Simple. Oil and Gas.
7691 2018-03-17 21:30:53 I think this is my least shambolic #StPatricksDay evarrrrh! Am almost certain that Olbas Oil doesn’t count as celebrating 
7692 2018-03-17 21:30:45 Yes they get the oil via train so more money for them and sell it back to us
7693 2018-03-17 21:30:39 This sign alone would deter would be shooters.
7694 2018-03-17 21:30:37 It may not be likely but McDavid still has a decent shot of hitting the 45-goal mark. 40+ goals and 100 points is awfully impressive considering he was sick for a good month of the season.  #Oilers
7695 2018-03-17 21:30:22 Did you down a whole bottle of baby oil then make this
7696 2018-03-17 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。

7698 2018-03-17 21:29:58 I'd rather drive my GMC ACADIA. It's  a 2013. Only put gas, oil n tires on it. Can you say that ....
7699 2018-03-17 21:29:45 The fact they were imprisoned speaks volumes. Establishment sees them as a threat to their agenda of appeasing their Saudi Muslim masters. It's all about oil and arms deals worth billions. Bigger picture at play, Fransen, Goulding collateral damage. Wake up Britain.
7700 2018-03-17 21:29:32 Just made some new essential oil roller balls 
7701 2018-03-17 21:29:28 I like to oil up before I wrestle that bastard. It gives me the advantage
7702 2018-03-17 21:29:25 I am sitting on the Queen of Oak Bay this very minute and I can tell you this Ferry is not an oil tanker full of oil, nor would it have the same impact if it caught fire like the #sanchi, hit something or sank. Ferry incidents have been plentiful over the years.
7703 2018-03-17 21:29:15 castor oil will also help it grow faster!! 
7704 2018-03-17 21:29:13 is there like an essential oil of halal cart?
7705 2018-03-17 21:28:30 Leave him. Ai daidai nake dashi.
7706 2018-03-17 21:28:17 You said canola oil was bad but smh you speak lies! 
7707 2018-03-17 21:28:08 Y will ppl b making fun of serious matters
7708 2018-03-17 21:28:01 I follow Back 100% Trump Train Strong 
7709 2018-03-17 21:27:54 You mix the Gluten Free flour in with the shredded carrots, potatoes, spinach and onion untill it forms a dough, season and drop batter onto oiled pan. I prefer Avocado Oil or Grape seed oil but EXTRA virgin Olive Oil will work well. 
& Enjoy!
7710 2018-03-17 21:27:37 I haven't seen it, but in principle I think it's a mistake. If you can't find an appropriately diverse cast then you can't put the show on. Would they do an all-white production of Oil and Water?
7711 2018-03-17 21:27:33 After I saw the article with the Washington Governor I changed my mind. We keep sending the oil so Washington can't get it. It's the gas we stop.
7712 2018-03-17 21:27:10 そうだねあは
7713 2018-03-17 21:26:25 Exactly! We need some grease in our lives. I think all the food on his shows look shit anyway. Even the seating looks wrong and not everyday olive oil goddamnit
7714 2018-03-17 21:26:07 You will soon see Susan. The rogue agencies are directed from the Oval Office. Watch and learn. See and know. Ignore the Fake Views of the Hollow Man, Donald.
7715 2018-03-17 21:26:04 The proposed increase is 7 times more for starters and I can tell you this initial increase is only for starters. They have big dreams of bringing their oil sands to our beaches! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
7716 2018-03-17 21:25:58 David you are taking in the propoganda to easy let me tell you goverments don't rule the world the secret society mainly the New World Order who are the world's richest people.bankers,oil kings,presidents.royals, they call the shots may ,is just a pawn she is told what to do
7717 2018-03-17 21:25:51 my hair smell like tea tree oil and chill
7718 2018-03-17 21:25:47 Yes grill cloth wld be fab, its a pity my stack is only mdf if it was a jcm I cld remove the tolex and sand the beech ply and lemon oil it, that wld be very cool.
7719 2018-03-17 21:25:40 Please tell me that they're protesting something to do with oil! Let's use a petroleum based product to protest petroleum products!!! Its moron inception!
7720 2018-03-17 21:25:00 No. Estaba preso porque se quedó con el impuesto a las naftas que vendía Oil. Eso no es evasión ni deuda. Es ROBO.
#JusticiaCorrupta
7721 2018-03-17 21:24:53 Dinner client tonight  asked me to have some fun with #blackbeans.  They said, "What u got?". I'm going with shallots, garlic,  fennel,  Sauvignon Blanc,  Wild Mushroom Stock, Creole Dust. A quick cook, finishing it w lump crab, tossed in garlic olive oil,  tarragon and togarashi
7722 2018-03-17 21:24:45 That artificially created sovereign micro state was drilling into Iraqi oil fields
7723 2018-03-17 21:24:29 Not like the fans have been talking about this for awhile now or anything....lol
7724 2018-03-17 21:24:06 Any Anime Character: What's this? The meat's plentiful juices mingle with the lightly-textured coating saturated with high quality oil and moderately seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and pepper along with the sweetness of oranie mixed in. Delicious!
Me: Yeah, that's good.
7725 2018-03-17 21:23:56 DIY hot oil treatment for da night, gonna get my hair together for NOLA 
7726 2018-03-17 21:23:53 If Texas gets overrun by Californians y'all can hide out here in Oklahoma. Probably the only place Californians hate more. Oil everywhere.
7727 2018-03-17 21:23:41 びゅーん(なんか違う)
7728 2018-03-17 21:23:36 In that case, lets through an entire oil refinery on the fire.   ;)
7729 2018-03-17 21:23:34 Olive oil is the GOAT
7730 2018-03-17 21:23:33 OMG! YOU AMERICANS DONT KNOW ANTHING ABOUT THE CLOWNS YOU PUT IN OFFICE! OBAMA DESTROYED LIBYA FOR SELLING THEIR OIL IN THE DINAR, INSTEAD OF THE PETROL DOLLAR! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THE LAST 8 YEARS!
7731 2018-03-17 21:23:21 You were down for a nigga with motor oil in his nice bout
7732 2018-03-17 21:23:19 Prof the annoying scam is saying the last administration left it at 20% when piers were erected already, only precast was assembled by this administration,and not yet paved.
7733 2018-03-17 21:23:02 And you Donna stop using your social media device made with oil.
7734 2018-03-17 21:22:56 WHY?  What can a in uneducated, privileged  fashion designer know about training for jobs in future technologies? WH policy is oil, not solar or wind or even ethenol. Wasting Iowans hard earned tax dollars, AGAIN, acting governor. Can't wait to repeal & replace you!
7735 2018-03-17 21:22:43 Yes I am fully aware of the orca/salmon issue. A possible oil spill is one of many issues. I guess we can round and round. I do respect your view and concern. I feel that our world class environmental review should be enough. I guess we'll see what happens.
7736 2018-03-17 21:22:41 Spring onions, sundried tomatoes (watch the oil)' teeny bits of red pepper. Assuming in the batter rather than stuffing?
7737 2018-03-17 21:22:26 You see what looks to be a well used and never cleaned hand-and-half sword called, "The Baster Sword." It smells delicious and deals additional 1D6 fire damage. Can also spray hot oil for 1D6 cone of fire damage by squeezing pommel. #DnD #DnDadjokes #PunBard
7738 2018-03-17 21:22:25 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I’ll take smart and evil over what we’ve got right now. Whatever it takes to have Trump removed from office, disgraced, jailed, his family and all his descendants destitute forever. FBI, CIA, neo-con war dog oil profiteers...anything.
7739 2018-03-17 21:22:15 The only purpose for extending the line beyond Abbotsford where it splits and runs south to WA refineries is to take it to Westridge to oil tankers. Once it is built the gun to our head Alberta has on us becomes loaded and we’ll be forced into accepting even more.
7740 2018-03-17 21:22:01 is that not waste? like from a car or something. a type of oil?
7741 2018-03-17 21:21:52 Stop allowing USA protesters to infiltrate and fund these protests as they try to keep Alberta oil landlocked so they can buy it cheaper.
7742 2018-03-17 21:21:49 Please remove oil sands emession cap as there is no three industry in the world that has these stupid caps. Hand cuffing the golden goose is a horrible policy.
7743 2018-03-17 21:21:25 なに、わいとも遊びに行こうよねえ(は)
それはそれはあ、そうだったね
7744 2018-03-17 21:21:18 It’s only decent if baked with some oil and salt.
7745 2018-03-17 21:21:17 And I get that but with the type of injury it is & the fact he's already had it once before, though I'm not sure if it's the same ankle, I'd push for the shutdown. But ultimately it is up to the player.
7746 2018-03-17 21:21:15 PS my hair grows like crazy when I don’t wash it. Many may think this is super gross, but I try not to wash it. I don’t add any oil to it when it’s braided. I just leave it alone and it flourishes. It’s so healthy RN it’s cray
7747 2018-03-17 21:20:50 Getting my oil changed shouldn't take this long fuck all these slow ass men.
7748 2018-03-17 21:20:45 If the criteria is to exclude things that everyone agrees smell gross, and only include scents you personally hate that others don’t mind, my top ranked most hated smells are:

Subway sandwich shops
Lavender oil

They both smell so repulsive to me. Anyone else I follow have one?
7749 2018-03-17 21:20:28 No doubt there are those who would love to be able to portray him as “chief salesman for Big Oil.” He’s clearly not taken the bait.
7750 2018-03-17 21:20:11 @gguu_kk00 タグリツありがとうございます！アイコンのグク可愛すぎます良ければ絡んでくれたりすると嬉しいです
7751 2018-03-17 21:19:58 Drink anointing oil
7752 2018-03-17 21:19:58 It becomes ever-more-apparent that this WH is only concerned with CONSOLIDATING WEALTH in hands of "Trump's 1%" and human beings OUTSIDE that sphere ... DON'T COUNT! He's no diff from predecessors, but he is BALD-FACED & HAM-HANDED re SLAUGHTERING PPL for OIL & POPPY-FIELDS.
7753 2018-03-17 21:19:57 Brian I saw JNK and HYG both roll over before Feb selloff 
Last two trading days JNK HYG rallied.  I think market has been consolidating for move higher near term 
Dxy could rally as a head wind but using that as catalyst for a breakdown in gold.  Seems safer than short oil
7754 2018-03-17 21:19:41 When I look at this picture& I look at the question,I'm like this is oil& water(two things that don't mix)but ke if you must know I appreciate my body when I'm alone,but hate it in the presence of other's (e.g. my boyfriend)
7755 2018-03-17 21:19:40 @ComfortUK why can't I find your jojoba oil conditioner in any local supermarkets please? Only one we can use.
7756 2018-03-17 21:19:21 Ah, okay that makes sense. I personally think a lot of conservation efforts should be focused towards renewable resources- i.e. stop using coal and oil, stop cutting down forests, ect. But like, y'know, big oil and coal companies are rich and evil, so
7757 2018-03-17 21:19:03 But wait ooo, imagine what will happen, what the media will look like, if that country decides to follow the S-Arabia path of raising funds, that is they decide to sell part of dia national oil company!!!
7758 2018-03-17 21:18:59 between Fukushima and the recent oil spills the Pacific ocean may be dead soon and everyone else too
7759 2018-03-17 21:18:58 My boss is so cute I gave him some peppermint oil and he asked if he should put it on his third eye lol
7760 2018-03-17 21:18:55 My dad called me and told me he was gonna give me his card tomorrow to get my oil changed and other things.. why he being so sweet to me y’all?
7761 2018-03-17 21:18:51 New fuel filter , Oil , spark plugs and Carbs boy i done stripped this mf nakedddd i said
7762 2018-03-17 21:18:45 Hmm Pls when vandals break oil pipeline what do call them? Niger Delta Militants? Or vandals?
7763 2018-03-17 21:18:39 Sure we do, by not allowing it. An oil spill in these waters would have a disastrous impact on salmon, spawning streams and all the creatures and people who depend on the sea for their existence...including our endangered southern resident orcas. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
7764 2018-03-17 21:18:37 No I am quoting the Port website that I shared. That said, please know this too - I don't disagree that there is an increased risk. Do you think that we are looking at one side of the equation though? Will there be an opportunity to stop Oil tankers coming in?
7765 2018-03-17 21:18:37 Usually a 1-to-1 ratio of flour and some kind of fat (oil, butter) cooked to a brown color and used as a base for certain dishes. Like a Cajun gumbo. Alternatively people use okra or file powder as a thickening agent.
7766 2018-03-17 21:18:35 @ap24x7justin The petroleum products are at the stage when the barrel of crude oil was at $145 and the current price is about $65. People bore the burden.  They will resent any further loot.
7767 2018-03-17 21:18:34 I’ll never understand the trend of naming your car. Like no Rachel, that’s not “Betty”, that’s a 2002 Honda Civic and it needs an oil change. And sorry Bobby, that’s not “Pearl”, that’s a ‘99 F-150 and you need a new muffler.
7768 2018-03-17 21:18:30 Wen u  wash the weed u get wax! Wen u wash the wax u get oil... 97% THC PUT THAT IN YA 8$ vape pen and see if u go back 2 rollin weed?
7769 2018-03-17 21:18:04 Hello is Bojan and excite CSUBakersfield condor town is friend for oilers. Condor best team and champions and hope oilers make competitions loose. And Bakersfield knows real oil too. Excite to watch oiler team and learn champion players and drill.
7770 2018-03-17 21:17:59 Good question Kevin cos you mention the amount of years of NS oil left yet Dave mentions money and jobs which has nothing to do with amounts of oil? It's like he didn't even read your tweet?
7771 2018-03-17 21:17:42 It shows no such thing, which came first, currency printing or a supply shock of foreign currency due to an oil sales boycott? You're trying to use V for dramtic effect and failing miserably.
7772 2018-03-17 21:17:22 use rose hip seed oil please listen to me on this one you will thank me this is the secret to ur best life
7773 2018-03-17 21:17:21 It was lovely to see you there Lis;  and I still can't believe that you have your 50 year #type1diabetes #T1D medal - you don't look old enough to warrant one! (Do you drink Oil of Olay???)
7774 2018-03-17 21:17:19 ITS TAKEN ME ALMOST A YEAR TO GET THEM THIS LONG AND I USE JOJOBA OIL ON THEM (WHEN I REMEMBER) TO KEEP THEM STRONG!! BUT THANK YOU
7775 2018-03-17 21:17:17 Their con job is over. get the truth out on #IsraelGate #BanAIPAC foreign power and #StopWW3.

You can also.

Stop Trump, Koch, AIPAC owned CIA pro-kxl Mike Pompeo and the other big oil gang warmongers through #BakkenGate.
7776 2018-03-17 21:17:01 What are you talking about my good man. If teams in are in a playoff race, guys will play through almost anything, regardless of sport. When the games don't matter, it's rather pointless. This is nothing new from my end.
7777 2018-03-17 21:16:54 good things? Let the Gestapo loose? Opened pristine areas to filthy oil drilling? Reduced national monuments for mining interests? Gave tax cuts to billionaires? DACA? Tariffs? Debased the presidency? Fucked a porn star? Which of these was good??
7778 2018-03-17 21:16:47 That’s oil that y’all are in Alaska!  Hope you guys make it to H-town sometime.
7779 2018-03-17 21:16:29 I am also correct that you take outstanding photos that always tell their own powerful story about living with oil and gas. Thank you, Julie.
7780 2018-03-17 21:16:26 NOW I know it’s time to start making the rest of these clowns who’s eyes  are NOT open to the deceivers of this WORLD are. Saints it’s time to start singing the gospel! Jesus is coming! Lights are shining brighter by the day! Do you have enough oil to FIGHT & Reveal TRUTH?
7781 2018-03-17 21:15:57 "Renewable" Biomass Power Generation is continuing to tear them down at a much faster rate than they can be replanted. So is Palm Oil production for biofuels and a myriad of food and cosmetic products.
7782 2018-03-17 21:15:29 Ceec body stiff ehn, she needs to drink engine oil #bbnaija
7783 2018-03-17 21:15:26 Spoken like a person of enormous privilege, ignoring history that current laws were written after we took their land at gunpoint. Sustainable energy is good for people & the environment. Oil mining benefits only a small minority. Only a hard choice for those who serve the 1%.
7784 2018-03-17 21:15:00 Cee c should just go and drink engine oil or something.... that girl is stiff #bbnaija
7785 2018-03-17 21:14:42 Save me please Mario!
7786 2018-03-17 21:14:38 Crude oil.
7787 2018-03-17 21:14:37 Lol... didn't know they used oil..I shouldn't waste your time dear
7788 2018-03-17 21:14:36 Prime up before she climb up Rastaman that used to sell corn would use this same line followed by gun oil!!! Shots fi Di gun
7789 2018-03-17 21:14:24 Agreed
7790 2018-03-17 21:14:21 初リプです！フォローとかしなくてもいいんで絡みたいです)
7791 2018-03-17 21:14:04 My grandfather had coal on his property. He used it for heat and cooking. He also had coal oil lamps and a spring for refrigeration. Technology, unless it meets certain standards is a dirty word and this is what the left wants to return too. minus the coal of course.
7792 2018-03-17 21:13:55 All my childhood: no ma, I won't get out of my house with oil in my hair.
Me: puts oil in my hair every time I shampoo, goes out with oiled hair everywhere.
7793 2018-03-17 21:13:52 To clarify on melting the oil down in water, I mean keeping the coconut oil still in the jar and using hot water to liquify it, not scooping oil directly into hot water lol
7794 2018-03-17 21:13:50 Well I thought kayla put Sun screen on me it was tanning oil. This is why I have trust issues.
7795 2018-03-17 21:13:33 He's now pace for 102. That would be a great achievement for McDavid in a season that hasn't had many things go right for the Oil.
7796 2018-03-17 21:13:24 Oil dey dah guy head
7797 2018-03-17 21:13:22 This soldering station had the bandcamp for a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for labels app is one of renraku
7798 2018-03-17 21:13:09 Which is why oil and gas leaders have come out in support of the carbon tax right? I love how Kenney cronies ignore that.
7799 2018-03-17 21:13:04 Now why it take over an hour to get an oil change?!?! Will NOT be going back to y’all again hell
7800 2018-03-17 21:12:52 Trains derail all the time, but the reason rail officials were held responsible in that case was due to the cargo difference and disaster scope. So where was the trial for the oil officials who put oil on that train? How would Lac-Mégantic officials differ from Port officials?
7801 2018-03-17 21:12:46 Harsh language. That's why she's practicing it on Twitter.
7802 2018-03-17 21:12:22 Hmm. Just got my essential oil’s from Eden’s Garden. I ordered Greek lavender but it doesn’t smell like lavender to me at all, it is more  camphorous than anything.
7803 2018-03-17 21:12:21 Same happened to me when I got my driver's license renewed. As I was waiting I kept fluffing my hair, dabbing away shiny parts, etc. when I got my license it looked like a ham shank wearing a wig drenched in baby oil. 
7804 2018-03-17 21:12:16 いや、やば
7805 2018-03-17 21:12:08 Holy fuck the chili oil I just used on my salmon destroyed my sinuses and my throat and my lungs and my eyes while that shit was cooking. Fuck that.
7806 2018-03-17 21:11:56 Russia does, they clearly are behind all of this~no sanctions being lifted=no need for Tillerson!! Since his only role was to oversee the Crimea/Russian oil pipeline once  45 was in office sans sanctions~so, IMHO they fired Tillerson to make him look tough on Russia WHICH HE ISNT
7807 2018-03-17 21:11:39 In the wake of what is currently happening at #Burnaby Mountain, I would like to get your opinion. Do you think it is right for these people to protest outside the oil pipeline company, or do you think they are just causing harm to an innocent company.
#fd87miccheckyo
7808 2018-03-17 21:11:39 "opals should never be kept in oil" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA
7809 2018-03-17 21:11:32 An edible one!! I’m making the next batch with almond oil
7810 2018-03-17 21:11:28 I'm a big fan of coconut oil. The only problem doing that with this machine is you'll want to melt it down before you put it in, either in a pot on low or in hot water. But coconut oil (raw if you like the flavor of coconut) + soy lecithin in this machine makes great cannaoil
7811 2018-03-17 21:11:27 What's funny is that we have a place by me called Cafe Lube. It's a coffee shop/oil change place!
7812 2018-03-17 21:11:25 John Calipari says he doesn’t know where the oil goes in a car….

He definitely knows where to put it in his hair.
7813 2018-03-17 21:11:19 Was an @Kameandkettle day over here, Irish Motor Oil
7814 2018-03-17 21:10:47 It's not surprising the right have no wit, charm or intelligence which is why 75% of the gdp come from blue cities. They are lucky they can dig holes for oil. It's embarrassing
7815 2018-03-17 21:10:44 That moment when your crush tells you about the person she's crushing on
7816 2018-03-17 21:10:44 Playing RNH with McD took a while too. Coaching cost this team a playoff berth
7817 2018-03-17 21:10:21 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…

7825 2018-03-17 21:09:15 just watched someone make a chocolate cupcake recipe, and they added water to chocolate to help melt it.
NONONONONONONONO.
adding any type of liquid to chocolate causes it to seize! melt it with a solid such as coconut oil or butter!

7827 2018-03-17 21:08:51 This proposal is about shipping 7 times more tankers of oil out of Westridge through a very busy Burrard Inlet and 2 difficult narrows. Lac-Mégantic was an oil transportation fire in a populated area, albeit not as populated and as risky as Vancouver and what happened there!
7828 2018-03-17 21:08:42 Hell I'll cheer for anyone wearing the Oil drop right now, but a successful reclamation project would be oh so good. Great hockey name too.
7829 2018-03-17 21:08:38 Hitting Ch19 of @tferriss 4HB like, “babe, do you want 2-3lbs of fatty organic grass-fed beef or 4 lg hard boiled eggs, Brazil nuts, 20 raw almonds, fermented cod liver oil and butter fat for dinner?”  I definitely have expendable pieces of furniture in my apartment.

7861 2018-03-17 21:01:12 That's 22 unit trains a day. 134 cars at 100MT each. I'm not sure oil and grain get that many trains a day combined.
7862 2018-03-17 21:00:45 Who know where I can find them oil pins from 
7863 2018-03-17 21:00:32 I have resorted to rationing the last few toradol injections I have & praying that CBD oil kicks in & does something.

7869 2018-03-17 21:00:03 March 17, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7870 2018-03-17 20:59:48 I’ve tried tea tree, coconut oil, and a treatment from Lush (I can’t remember the name) but they haven’t worked for me. I heard that aztec clay and apple cider vinegar as a hair mask works! I’ll definitely try jojoba oil.
7871 2018-03-17 20:59:47 Using diffusers with peppermint oil to deter the fruit flies. Think I used too much oil though because my nose is burning! 
7872 2018-03-17 20:59:40 This is why I get frustrated. You refer to a rail disaster and an open sea collision. These are things that muddy debate waters and deflect from issue at hand. Regarding Lac, had that oil flowed through Energy East... no rail disaster!
7873 2018-03-17 20:59:27 Who TF calls a pet store asking if they have marijuana!?

I mean we have catnip and CBD oil for nervous cockatiels
7874 2018-03-17 20:59:26 I hope we keep buying oil from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Just keep bringing in dirty oil from those countries when next door we have our own oil. I hope gas goes to 3 dollars now. #CloseTheTaps
7875 2018-03-17 20:58:50 #onmymind- #nigeria- 
The sooner some Nigerians face reality the better. 
The oil boom economy is grinding to a halt and we have to work hard to sustain ourselves and the next generation to come.
 It is a very serious matter.

7881 2018-03-17 20:58:02 The Arab oil billionaire needs  to pay an opposition player or even worse the teammates of Mo Salah to injure the damn king before our European tie. This is me admitting that Mohammed Salah is the best player at the moment in Europe behind Ronaldo and Messi.
7882 2018-03-17 20:57:55 No they haven't.   What';s happening is just history is moving on, as it tends to.

Scotland has been dropping away since 2014..part is the oil price collapse..but part is having a govt not interested in governing...when that ends things will get better again.
7883 2018-03-17 20:57:34 urgh I want oil paint but literally it brings me nothing but pain

7890 2018-03-17 20:56:52 kama haujawai use cooking oil as body lotion, you don't know the struggle..
7891 2018-03-17 20:56:31 By impeding and sabotaging our product you are boosting evil oil regimes abroad. You are helping the Saudi. You are helping the Russians. You are against Canada. #TransMountain
7892 2018-03-17 20:56:30 And oil does not destroy the environment the way you would be led to believe think about it, how come no body is protesting offshore drilling think about that for a minute? In the United States the largest producer of oil they literally are drilling in the ocean .. no protests ?
7893 2018-03-17 20:56:16 Natural Peanut butter has to be refrigerated because the oil can spoil. The regular PB is fine because of the chemicals.

7900 2018-03-17 20:55:25 I know, it’s the same principle. You put it on your stovetop. It rules, plus you can make coffee with it when you aren’t making butter or oil.

7909 2018-03-17 20:53:17 He's realizing the public isn't but in the snake oil and the blowback is building into a big blue tsunami.  He is playing candy land in a chess match and his lawyers can't control his impulses so he keeps digging.  He'll be in China soon.  Nowhere else to dig.

7911 2018-03-17 20:52:43 This has been enjoyable. I’m convinced Michael Bradley was built in a laboratory, and gets regular oil changes & diagnostic circuit maintenance. #MTL #TFC
7912 2018-03-17 20:52:43 yes thats correct Abu. and like you said, the people that will provide the $ are not donkeys ..but atleast s-arabia is thinking of lifting its economy off oil, unlike another country i know

7914 2018-03-17 20:51:43 Mixing a few drops of tea tree oil with my shampoo helped a lot. Focus the mix on your scalp rather than the hair

7917 2018-03-17 20:51:29 Strong choice there. 
Personally I just dive straight in.....although I'm on a diet so last time i did camembert  (garlic, chilli &oil) I had it with carrot sticks to make sure I was super healthy 
7918 2018-03-17 20:51:17 is there risk yea there is but not a bunch and I have physically and this is not bullshit cleaned up heavy oil spills much easier than traditional oil,just feels like We are not in this together imagine if middle provinces banned transport to mitigate risk of road collisions
7919 2018-03-17 20:51:17 The only significant difference I've felt after taking cannabis oil is crazy dreams at night.
7920 2018-03-17 20:51:03 Electric cars have been around for over 100 years, it couldn't replace oil powered vehicles because of poor battery technology. With d speed at which battery innovation is going, it will probably take another 100yrs b4 electric vehicles can completely replace oil powered vehicles

7922 2018-03-17 20:50:33 Have never dared buy a box of olive oil. Am v into corn oil atm. God I'm wild.
7923 2018-03-17 20:50:28 Una never see anything for Lagos. This your Governor put cotton wool with better engine oil for ear ooo. You better cover your nose with correct wet handkerchief.

Have you heard how much they use to guarantee the hapless company?
7924 2018-03-17 20:50:20 They’re building treatment facilities now. This is a false equivalence. Sewage is no where near as bad for the ocean as oil. Like comparing a B.B. gun to an AK!
7925 2018-03-17 20:49:49 Admittedly I find myself adding more and more butter and salt to things these days. And my olive oil is a 2 litre box.
7926 2018-03-17 20:49:44 Yep, just like 9/11, where everywhere across the world ppl could smell the BS and suspected an inside job by the Jews who were creating a False flag war under that buffoon Bush, as an excuse to raid oil rich arabs states, without demonstrations back home!

7942 2018-03-17 20:47:46 The oil memes on Reddit are pretty damn funny.
7943 2018-03-17 20:47:42 The Russians that come to Britain are businessmen who left Russia because they were suspected of stealing Russia's Gas and Oil money...from other businessmen suspected of stealing Russia's gas and oil.  They probably killed each other.

7950 2018-03-17 20:46:13 Questions from a snake oil salesman.
7951 2018-03-17 20:46:12 He took the job to lift Russian sanctions and get his hands on a cut of their oil money.  His motive was freed - not public service.
7952 2018-03-17 20:46:03 pfft that's why you put peanut butter on those vegetables XD or fry them up with oil & salt & eat em with delicious bread/rice/whatever ^_^

7954 2018-03-17 20:45:56 It's horrid, isn't it? Radical as this sounds (because it goes against everything that we think we know about problem skin) I've ditched shower gel completely because it was all awful and have reverted to an olive oil soap. It seems to have made a small difference.

Save for rainy days

Train oil workers for work in other sectors

Create policy for longevity not short term gain

7998 2018-03-17 20:39:39 Bradley, the Kinder Morgan proposal has nothing to do with water or your belief that we’ll be invaded by the US for our water. You’re way off track justifying oil tankers and oil spills, all of which don’t blend well with any water, drinkable or not.
7999 2018-03-17 20:39:24 Well we going to really find out more about the 10more oil plants in the United States of America they talking about building right

In summary, d pple data will provide those $ aren't fools.
8021 2018-03-17 20:33:47 I thought the common goal in the military was to “fight for freedom”? “Spread democracy”? “Get more oil”? One of those.
8022 2018-03-17 20:33:45 Adding more oil tankers to the equation is only going to increase risk...as would giving guns to teachers in US classrooms to add more weapons and bullets to the existing risk there. It’s called doubling down on oil spill risk! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
8023 2018-03-17 20:33:45 I look at this way, the oil is going to come here no matter what.

8052 2018-03-17 20:29:30 Check out the Brookings study that came out after the election. Small cities - anyplace under 250,000 have been left behind in the recovery. Without manufacturing what do those places have for income? What do you sell the rest of the country to pay for oil & goods? Hard to say.
8053 2018-03-17 20:29:11 Err... "Take notice"? Mulcair was the leader of the official opposition. And he killed it in the HoC. MSM intentionally ignored his status and successes. "Balanced budgets" was just the tired spin they used to cover their installation of a fresh Big Oil Lib-Con puppet.

8059 2018-03-17 20:28:19 @samstein This also requires a belief that Tillerson left the private sector for #Trump’s cabinet out of a sense of altruistic public service. It’s more likely he was chosen by Putin, as Trump was, to lift Obama sanctions that blocked their access to $500 billion in oil money.
8060 2018-03-17 20:28:05 Stop recommending coconut oil on your face. It’s a 4 on the comedogenic scale. Plz stop.
8061 2018-03-17 20:27:58 Yes there is loads left. But in 100 years we probably wont be using oil in the amounts used now so its value might fall.

8097 2018-03-17 20:22:33 On top of this, the IEA chronically underestimates global demand growth almost almost every single year. That’s why we crunch our own supply/demand balances and have been hugely bullish
8098 2018-03-17 20:22:31 Tea tree oil + jojoba oil applied right after the shower, directly to scalp. My sister has psoriasis on her scalp, so regular “dry scalp” remedies don’t work. This one does.
8099 2018-03-17 20:22:23 America has had enough of you your oil money & lies watch out give your security team a raise.might have a traitors in your crew
8100 2018-03-17 20:22:00 WINNING BIGLY! My federal action is close to LEGALIZING CANNABIS! 1st amendment, religious rights to have cannabis buds for the making of the Holy oil of Christ. It's right there in the BIBLE.
8101 2018-03-17 20:21:44 That’s not remotely true. It’s more cost effective than coal and oil. Both of those forms also receive aid from the government. Likewise, natural gas pipelines receive millions via eminent domain assistance.
8102 2018-03-17 20:21:42 Wow, and back in your day in nineteen dickety four $30 would buy four years’ supply of whale oil and hardtack.
8103 2018-03-17 20:21:41 Do you know that the pound was created by a Scotsman and the decommissioning in Norway is done by the oil companies not the tax payers? You parcel of rogues has mismanaged Scottish assets. Time to end that.
8104 2018-03-17 20:21:28 Thank you so much Ian for responding. I actually made your cake today and personally I like a good dense cake made with butter vs with oil. This recipe is by far the best carrot cake! Thank you so much again, and I hope your still baking!
8105 2018-03-17 20:21:15 My old one stunk. I read if you keep good oil in and keep them clean, they can be less smelly.
8106 2018-03-17 20:21:04 Oil is the blood of the earth and once depleted the earth and all is's inhabitants will die. So as capitalism will have it we're headed down a dead end street! Yelp, these are the end times!
8107 2018-03-17 20:21:02 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump our Sensible @POTUS ...We are not fighting over oil; We're producing it!

8109 2018-03-17 20:20:32 You're tweeting on a device made with help of oil. I'll tell you what, you liberals stop Flying all over the world on a daily basis, stop contributing to the climate change ideology you're pushing & I might think you're actually serious there's a problem.
8110 2018-03-17 20:19:56 olive oil + honey warmed. hair mask for like 30 mins, wash out, and then leave a damp microfibre towel in hair to retain moisture. i used this when my hair was suuuuper dry, with lots of dandruff. this also added lots of sheen.
8111 2018-03-17 20:19:53 Partly agree as fuel import cost Will drop but alternatives are not always lower on opex than f.ex. oil. Ex. Biogas production cost is between 140-200 euro per MWh. Power to gas opex still high... Of course in our sector we can not are beyond 36 months. Future is impossible to
8112 2018-03-17 20:19:23 No kidding!  Practically child abuse!  That kid is messed up!
8113 2018-03-17 20:19:21 They don’t burn too well these days try the heirloom oil paintings - they spark a good blaze

8115 2018-03-17 20:19:00 Canadian presiden gave permanent residency to 25000 Syrian refugees,
But we indians still have to burn the midnight oil to get that dream of holding PR status in Canada 
Atleast we gujaratis trying hard for it.
8116 2018-03-17 20:18:50 The oilers are 3 to 2 there working hard in sunrise Florida keep up the good work oil
8117 2018-03-17 20:18:45 Canadians have complained about this for years!OPEC has bin funding climate orgs and an American who made his billions off Canadian Oil Sands have both bin undermining Ethical North American fuel industries forever under the guise of Climate Change!
8118 2018-03-17 20:18:40 If water is wet, is oil fried?
8119 2018-03-17 20:18:31 Let's not mix issues. Back to my original point, the protesters don't seem to acknowledge their own dependency on oil and that BC demand is increasing and will be filled by US or other foreign oil. Electricity and renewables is a different issue altogether.
8120 2018-03-17 20:18:21 “Our” Sterling would be more correct. Remind us of the output of North Sea oil and the cost of decommissioning rigs?
8121 2018-03-17 20:17:57 The redness is the worst! I still suffer with it now on my face. The coconut oil helps so so much. Also, I’ve used Tropic Tamanu Healing balm. It smells like curry but it is a miracle worker! I also told one of my friends with eczema on her face and she loves it.
8122 2018-03-17 20:17:53 Three years ago at @GLOBE_Series in Vancouver, I overheard @Tzeporah offer a “social license” transaction to a Canada-based oil company executive. It is plain to see where that has got us.
8123 2018-03-17 20:17:48 Just washed my hair with Tea Tree Oil. Gotta use something green you know... #HappyStPatricksDay #green #teatreeoil #Melaleuca #MelaleucaOil #essentialoils #hairwashing

8126 2018-03-17 20:17:23 His obvious lack of intellectual acumen calls for remedial classes --even w/the low standards of a gov't. school.  It's doubtful any respectable college will accept this malcontent.
8127 2018-03-17 20:17:19 Tea tree oil 100% saved my life
8128 2018-03-17 20:17:13 Makes sense with oil supplies drying up
8129 2018-03-17 20:17:12 If you’re tryin to sell your drugs on Snapchat, stop touching all of it with your bare hands I don’t want oil that has your nasty sweat all over it.
8130 2018-03-17 20:16:48 What deal does Donald Jr. have with oil companies to keep his hair looking that way?
8131 2018-03-17 20:16:46 Spray some water on your legs and while they are wet massage with olive oil. 
Thank me later.
8132 2018-03-17 20:16:41 I’m sympathetic to the anti-pipeline movement but in Toronto when I see mile long oil tanker trains flying through midtown at high-speed I sometimes think maybe pipelines arent such a bad idea. I think the people of Lac Megantic might also agree
8133 2018-03-17 20:16:28 Drunk elephant has the loveliest face oil that I use!! It’s kinda pricy though. But like you can feel it soaking into your skin so well and like repairing what you’ve just broken down basically
8134 2018-03-17 20:16:26 As recommended by snake oil salesmen
8135 2018-03-17 20:15:56 Omg people are the worst. We’ve gone almost 5,000 over without getting an oil change, and we never get yelled at. People suck 
8136 2018-03-17 20:15:50 But not only do they get the weapons, but they also get US protection. That goes along way when you are the richest #oil country in the world and surrounded by hostility.
8137 2018-03-17 20:15:49 We’d agree that many are ignoring decline rates - some PMs/analysts we speak have no idea that shale well output can drop almost entirely after a few years. Shocking. We do have a non-OPEC supply estimate by country but unfortunately can only share that with our clients

8141 2018-03-17 20:14:55 "OIL TOT" no matter what place I'm in I'm always happy to be a part of your life. Your always considered "light" in my life as your pretty much of great importance so I agree with this post! Hugs for "Oil Tot"!
8142 2018-03-17 20:14:54 Contractors were not paid, oil theft at its peak, low allocation to states leading to unpaid salaries and u are saying fastes growing ecnomy. Ask Ngozi Okonjo to tell u what she said about the economy before u say what u dont know.
8143 2018-03-17 20:14:38 Does not our own oil generate its own measure of conflict? One should be careful when using terms like conflict, and ethical when referring to highly controversial subject. Someone can always call you on such terminology. #ableg #petrochemicals are divisive.
8144 2018-03-17 20:14:07 The dr jart is better as a daytime/everyday moisturizer. I usually follow up an AHA treatment with some kind of oil. Cuz that’s my extra. Dr jart better than nothing tho

8163 2018-03-17 20:11:55 CBD Oil; "Tonic" brand, works wonders for that sort of sleep disorder. I personally use it, it has a mint taste to it.
8164 2018-03-17 20:11:25 If they were doing BBNAIJA in NAIJA they would have had to find a way to get forte oil (Femi otedola ) to sponsor .
Because petrol!!!
8165 2018-03-17 20:11:05 Every time I see a weird liberal take like this about "leftist academia/theory" from nominally lefty folks it increases my desire to headbutt a nail. It's not that hard to understand that snake oil salesmen will ply their trade as long as people are willing to buy it.
8166 2018-03-17 20:10:58 The fact that Ireland outperforms the UK in quality of living, healthcare outcomes, education, life expectancy and GDP per capita (all without having access to the vast oil reserves that Scotland has) is evidence of the fact that the UK is demonstrably broken.
8167 2018-03-17 20:10:48 Why can’t the places you get your oil changed, JUST CHANGE YOUR OIL. Like I don’t need any of this extra shit, pls stop

8171 2018-03-17 20:10:11 Olive oil is amazing. Are you just using it and sea salt as a dressing?
8172 2018-03-17 20:10:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
8173 2018-03-17 20:10:08 Lol, olive oil is ok.

8179 2018-03-17 20:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

8192 2018-03-17 20:07:54 What has the US Southwest’s water problems have anything to do with shipping oil out of Westridge to Asia? Do you have any real reasons why you want oil tankers and oil spills in the Straight of Juan de Fuca or are you just looking to crawl under the covers with Alberta?
8193 2018-03-17 20:07:47 Fair. The only way I’m okay spending £88M on just a keeper when we have so many other positions to improve is if between now and deadline day we get bought by an oil baron.

8196 2018-03-17 20:06:23 in 2016, making up more than 2 percent of the total. This is bigger than extractive industries like mining, oil and gas combined — together, those industries contributed 1.4 percent — and double the economic impact of agriculture, including farming and logging.
8197 2018-03-17 20:06:19 Alberta's Notley threats to turn off oil to BC fails to take into account BC has access to Washington states oil industry a short 20 miles away! #fuckyoualberta

8202 2018-03-17 20:05:17 If it is oil base paint thinner or mineral spirits will get it out. Just put some on a piece of cloth and rub your hair. Water base paint will eventually wash out with soap and water.

8238 2018-03-17 19:59:25 Critical Thinking and Common Sense matter. A Strong and Patriotic Canada is needed again. Oil! Coal! LNG! Pipelines! Refineries! Proud Grandpa! #DumpTrudeau
8239 2018-03-17 19:59:19 Well they did raise him to be disrespectful and bratty, sooooo yes?

8242 2018-03-17 19:59:01 How does this compare to earning money from foreign countries when they purposefully stay at your hotels and clubs. 

If Obama rented his house in Chicago to the Ambassador of Pakistan and an oil oligarch from Russia, and kept the $$ would that bother you? Honestly?
8243 2018-03-17 19:58:56 Exactly. Then you act like we as a nation seek to raise I drastically. It’s simply so far from the truth it’s repulsive that anyone looks to you as a provider of knowledge. An energy transition can provide long-term solutions beyond peak oil. Your fear gives us nothing.
8244 2018-03-17 19:58:55 Of course it makes sense. It was in their interest to elect an American president who would lift the sanctions so Russian oil companies could do business here.
8245 2018-03-17 19:58:55 Missiles to Ukraine, 200 Russians killed in Syria, sanctions, expanding our oil capacity, and you have no idea what electronic black ops could be going on behind the scenes. Or should we, as the Obama admin would do, tell them what we’re doing to appease you.

8249 2018-03-17 19:58:21 To ensure that our products will meet your standards, each batch of oil undergoes an advanced Triple Lab TestedTM process to verify that there are no solvents, heavy metals, or other potentially harmful materials.
8250 2018-03-17 19:58:19 Ok. The #DemNPL18 convention is getting down right odd. Sleepy @JoeBiden just suggested a new campaign theme for @SenatorHeitkamp @HeidiHeitkamp - Don’t accuse @RepKevinCramer of being for big oil. #ConsensusNeeded. The crowd is asleep. Joe is truly the gift that keeps on giving
8251 2018-03-17 19:58:11 LOL. As it's the Independent, probably claiming it needs to be grilled in low-polyunsaturated & monounsaturated vegan 'Tofu' oil, or some such shite. 
8252 2018-03-17 19:58:10 Our hemp oil is derived from 100% legal non- GMO European grown hemp, and we utilize our proprietary extraction methods to extract the oil from the mature stalk of the plant.

8255 2018-03-17 19:57:43 I know what kind of problems exist EVERYWHERE! NOTHING will change until the GREED in Capitalism comes to a complete END World Wide! Americans don't know what is going on there except what the Major Media Mind Controlers like Fox etc., shove down their throats. Gold, Oil & Drugs!
8256 2018-03-17 19:57:28 I’ve been reading things that Ryan Zinke is proposing. Importing of elephant parts, big game hunting, Bears Ears, oil & gas drilling on public lands, doors, tables, airplane rides. . . I didn’t vote for Trump for this kind of stuff. Get rid of Zinke.
8257 2018-03-17 19:57:23 It is all about oil.
8258 2018-03-17 19:57:22 I LOVE Lube N' Go.  . . LoL Like,  they showed me the new oil they put in and the new air filter they put in.  . . Showing me the old one.  . . 

Like how they're suppose to.  . . I don't get that back in town.  . . LoL
8259 2018-03-17 19:57:10 I'm going to start getting into oil painting. I've been drawing with just pencil for forever lol ; I want to expand my art creativity!
8260 2018-03-17 19:57:01 my dad finally bought me a cover to protect my mattress and it was about time too because i really don’t want another olive oil incident
8261 2018-03-17 19:56:50 Just had the best mezze ever. Olive & sourdough bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar, green olives, semi-dried tomatoes & squeaky Yorkshire cheese. Locally sourced & bought from independent retailers. Too bad my stomach is trying to kill me now #IBSproblems #IBSsucks
8262 2018-03-17 19:56:47 Oil dey your head.
8263 2018-03-17 19:56:44 And what is the big conspiracy? That Kenney wants Alberta to get world market price for our oil rather than sell to the USA at a discount? What about E May that was born and raised in the USA and does all she can to kill pipeline which would benefit her home country?
8264 2018-03-17 19:56:44 Try baby oil!
8265 2018-03-17 19:56:26 Thank you, Queer Eye, for introducing me to the wonders of beard oil. And for hitting me right in the feels!
8266 2018-03-17 19:56:25 when I was a kid I remember watching emeril live and he talked about how he'd just roast heads of garlic in olive oil and eat them on the subway even though everyone hated him for it
8267 2018-03-17 19:56:16 People = sheep .  It is all about oil. Please wake up & do your own research.

8272 2018-03-17 19:55:39 On the computer...ha ha ha ha!!!! Reminds me of a time we had a closed bid for one car at work. Some man from eastern province came with his bid dripping with oil...anoitning oil.  He still didn't win because his bid amount was too low. Anointing oil didn't increase the  amount
8273 2018-03-17 19:55:39 @machinegunkelly coincidence that you are performing at 7:10 tomorrow?  #OiL
8274 2018-03-17 19:55:38 So, for some unknown reason, the oil change shop is playing a DVD of Bewitched? And she magicked what appeared to be a 67 Impala convertible into this dude's apartment  they couldn't fit the whole thing in frame, so I could only see the nose

8281 2018-03-17 19:54:17 well looking at female abstract expressionistic artists I thought of my mother and how growing up she told me she wanted to be and artist and never got to be... but she gave me my first oil painting kit which was hers... at 9 years old some things you never forget =)
8282 2018-03-17 19:54:00 There's an oil reserve in the Golan Heights?

Sounds like Syria needs some Freedom!
8283 2018-03-17 19:53:49 1. He did. 
2. No white candidate was ever asked to do so. 
3. Trump hasn't produced tax returns, which *are* traditionally provided. But he's a petty, self-promoting snake oil salesman owned by Russia, so.

8289 2018-03-17 19:52:49 I agree ET is no oil painting, but I'd never thought of him as an animated testicle before.
And now the image will not leave me.
8290 2018-03-17 19:52:41 Hi where are cheaper oil changes?
8291 2018-03-17 19:52:30 Sure, that's great. What's your plan with Alberta's oil? You just gonna leave that in the ground? How about a plan?

Maybe you could take some of that Bombardier money Trudeau handed out and invest in the patch again? How about a pipeline of two?
8292 2018-03-17 19:52:27 I hate to say it but yes. 

Aside the banks, oil and gas, maybe manufacturing, how many businesses have the same reveune as churches? 

Shashe banking or not; I daresay that N200Bn Zenith is touting upandan is small compared to some Big churches though. #MyOpinion
8293 2018-03-17 19:52:12 at least it's the nicest oil change waiting room I've ever seen...
8294 2018-03-17 19:51:56 Is it groundnut oil, red oil, olive oil or ynash oil?
8295 2018-03-17 19:51:46 What does everybody use on their stretch marks? I've been using baby oil but I want to hear better options
8296 2018-03-17 19:51:37 This made my day..

8300 2018-03-17 19:51:11 zinke is a shamelessly, corrupt tool of the oil companies.  a true embarrassment to our country and himself.

8304 2018-03-17 19:50:48 Haha. It’s sad that there exists in our population a certain number of people who actually believe this. These are the same people we have to protect from Nigerian oil men who need a favor.
8305 2018-03-17 19:50:44 Why does the oil change place insist on playing The Weather Channel all the time? I don’t like seeing these horrible tornado stories!!!!! 
8306 2018-03-17 19:50:06 You'd be missing out - a significant element of many artworks is texture. Also no print accurately conveys the depth of colour that you get with (for example) oil paint.
8307 2018-03-17 19:50:01 Okay, so what is the TRUTH? I've read a lot of information on the internet have friends in Southern Mexico, Central America & S. America. I believed Chavez was for the people the environment & saw the US, Russia and licking their lips to get at the oil, which I oppose!

8312 2018-03-17 19:49:26 If Washington state had Oil and Gas, they would be pumping it just like us.   They are just happy to refine it and sell it back to BC at huge profits.
8313 2018-03-17 19:49:11 Canadians are blessed by geography, and cursed by policy.  We stand upon vast energy wealth just below our feet, and our virtue signalling gvt calls it poison. In 2017 we exported $70 billion of oil (our #1 export). Trudeau wants to cut that back. The guy is nuts. We r doomed.
8314 2018-03-17 19:49:06 It’s. ridiculous that y’all take it so srsly when just a little of research and common sense you will see what ur doing is wrong and its bound to cause more harm than good. But go ahead and slather your skin with lemon juice and coconut oil. Go off sis.
8315 2018-03-17 19:49:03 If the only thing we had was carbon dating, that would be tricky but we have so many things all working in concert, plate tectonics, glaciers, rising of sea level, petrified forests, oil itself is pressurized organic material, layers of earth.

8320 2018-03-17 19:48:02 Andrew McCabe & James Comey honorably served their country and put themselves in harms way for over 20 years. You a dispicable,  lying,  snake oil salesman attempting to ruin people to save your own hide will get yours in the end. Truth Trumps All!

8322 2018-03-17 19:47:29 heres some tips i do for my crusty face: -washing ur face w cold water rather than hot water will hydrate ur face more and wake you up!

8328 2018-03-17 19:44:20 Beard oil. Come on!
8329 2018-03-17 19:44:20 Including spreading a false campaign on behalf of a Russian oil company that the 2014 Nigerian election was “rigged”. Clearly that wasn’t the theme of Trump’s campaign the last few months of 2016.
8330 2018-03-17 19:44:12 Well it does depend on the person, everyone is different but I’ve just heard nothing but bad. And once your skin gets adjusted to it, it’s super hard to come off the pill. Plus the main side affect,is it drying out your skin only cause it’s trying to reduce the production of oil
8331 2018-03-17 19:44:07 He sold himself to the oil Industry. Resist.
8332 2018-03-17 19:43:45 Stagflation occurs when a resource that makes other economic activity cheap suddenly becomes scarce,  leading to general price increases, lower economic activity,  and higher unemployment. E.g. oil.
8333 2018-03-17 19:43:41 The massive long position on oil pairs with the massive short position on the dollar... However, as per your DXY chart, this move could have a bit further to go before a hard reversal

8353 2018-03-17 19:39:13 Subsidize point-of-sale rewards for customers’ bringing reusable canvas bags. $1.00 or more each time no bag - plastic or paper - is needed. 

Many people don’t know that plastic bags are “petroleum byproducts”. Stop using them. Need fewer of them. Need less oil production WIN!

8356 2018-03-17 19:38:39 Reheat your French Fries in a cast iron skillet with a bit of oil for maximum crunchiness. When you take them out and while they’re still hot, add some salt for more flavor!
8357 2018-03-17 19:38:39 one of my larger #oil holding $cj.to had a very nice week. The dividend is still extraordinarily high and well covered in any #WTI scenario over around $52 USD. The hatred for Canadian oil still outrageous value if you have a constructive view on oil and a 2 year time horizon.
8358 2018-03-17 19:38:27 Which oil would be best for pampering my fledgling beard....olive or rapeseed
8359 2018-03-17 19:38:20 This would have to apply to all food - photos of felled rainforest and orphaned orangutans for foods containing palm oil etc.  Gets really complicated with processed foods.

8362 2018-03-17 19:37:25 ICYMI, #TransMountain is a private sector project, i.e. it is not an Alberta government project. And all the oil Alberta threatens to cut off to BC is developed by private companies as well- not by the government.
8363 2018-03-17 19:36:47 How about the oil and grease and artificiality genetically engineered meat  and food giving away cancer like the free toy in a #HappyMeal.

8373 2018-03-17 19:35:08 Is this to imply that training aids don't work?  I agree there is a lot of "snake oil" out there, but the @Impactsnap was completely game changing for me.  For specific issues, they can cut learning time significantly.
8374 2018-03-17 19:34:58 I dunno.. I'd rather have Russia's economic problems than the wests. Russia now has the 5th most FX reserves in the world. Miniscule budget deficit is based on $40 oil for the next 3 years. Lowest debt in the G20. Lowest inflation in history.
8375 2018-03-17 19:34:46 I’m sure old Rex made a fortune for himself and his oil buddies while he was supposed to be representing us. Don’t shed any tears for him, NYT. Although you have always loved Nazis, haven’t you?
8376 2018-03-17 19:34:43 If your out in the sun wear sunscreen! Two relatives of mine now have skin cancer because they didn't and did the opposite and used oil based products because they tan well. It also prematurely ages your skin and makes you look like a prune !
8377 2018-03-17 19:34:41 Lead them from temptation make them royalty alll the things we’re facing make us question it....lead us to salvation pour that oil please...that’s how we become kings and queens .... #frequency @JheneAiko
8378 2018-03-17 19:34:39 I always feel like an idiot when I get my car serviced. Do I pull up to the door? Do I park and go in? What kind of oil do I want? Should I get break fluid? Is Renny going to make it? 

So much to think about.
8379 2018-03-17 19:34:34 New battery.
New oil.
New filters.
New wipers. 

I’ve been adulting. 
8380 2018-03-17 19:34:27 He’s like a snake that’s lost it’s head, they writhe for hours! McCabe,arrogance, and dishonesty are like oil and water, they don’t mix! Crime doesn’t pay.
8381 2018-03-17 19:34:25 This firstly was about #gas which I had looked into. I can't claim to know as much about oil or coal but that wasn't my purpose. Fact is that misinformation was being given about #Russian gas, it would appear, as the industry seeks to try to convince the #public over #fracking.
8382 2018-03-17 19:33:54 Lmao. You think we’d go bust if the oil goes. Our owner has a country backing him and owns half of Ferrari. Think we’ll be okay.

8386 2018-03-17 19:33:12 Well I busted my oil pan again soooo
8387 2018-03-17 19:32:37 Thankful for Jamaican castor oil, flax seed gel and a dash of edge pomade 
8388 2018-03-17 19:32:36 So don't feed me bullshit about wanting what's good and right for Iranians or Muslim people at large.

You're just mad at the current Iranian government for the same reason you were mad at the MODERATE DEMOCRATIC government of 1953.

You want their oil but you can't get to it.

8390 2018-03-17 19:32:11 Lmaooo this shit happened to me when I was 10. I can never forget. Wanted to fry egg and left the oil on the stove too long, next thing 
8391 2018-03-17 19:31:39 You mean we have a goods trade deficit with a massive oil and raw materials exporting country while we export higher-paying services to generate better jobs. Oh no! Re-read his tweet. You look foolish.
8392 2018-03-17 19:31:30 I love paradox brainwash liberals. Less than 1/2 yr ago y'all were calling Tillerson a Russian puppet, bc he worked at ExxonMobil Oil company that has done business in Russia, & Putin gave him award in Russia. Now u use him in your Trump fired him bc Trump works for Russia, lol
8393 2018-03-17 19:31:29 Switch canola oil out for olive oil, it contains more nutrients and helps prevent arthritis and osteoporosis.
8394 2018-03-17 19:31:23 If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. Mother Teresa
8395 2018-03-17 19:31:17 Yes. We know what Iran looked like. It was ruled by the dictator Shah of Iran who tortured political dissidents. He was installed by MI5  and CIA (they fully admitted this in 2013) AFTER removing the democratically elected ruler Mosaddegh in 1953 cos the West wanted Iranian oil!
8396 2018-03-17 19:31:16 I suspected that I had fiddled too much.  The beauty of oil paint... you can scape it off.
8397 2018-03-17 19:31:13 Chia wrecked my B's and soon will finish off the Oilers. Oil are one big move from making it. Or breaking it.
8398 2018-03-17 19:31:08 ASMR oilで検索するといいよ
8399 2018-03-17 19:31:07 So I am dairy free- and just figuring out how hard it is to make fluffy wonderful pancakes using coconut milk instead of cow milk. Somebody talk me through this. Why are my pancakes with coconut milk flat greasy balls of oil instead of light and fluffy? How do I fix this?
8400 2018-03-17 19:30:29 Nope! I might accidentally toss cooking oil instead of water. Oops!
8401 2018-03-17 19:30:29 Lol, worked fine for me. Had gas & oil in it, let’s get this  done!
8402 2018-03-17 19:30:15 Curious timing: Cambridge Analytica’s late summer 2014 presentation to a top Russian oil company about election disruption techinques comes just a few months after the St Petersburg troll factory started its own efforts
8403 2018-03-17 19:30:07 I work in the oil industry and I’ve never seen it. Mostly imaginary, but I would condemn such behaviour if I saw it.
8404 2018-03-17 19:30:02 I get the amazing girlfriend award for today! I filled up my boyfriends car, bought and changed his windshield wipers, took his car to the car wash, and now took his car to get an oil change. Oh and I paid for all of it 
8405 2018-03-17 19:29:48 Yes please is right. I want to get some baby oil and wrestle you in a kiddie pool. And have @XXXJackHunter @JustinMatthewsx @MrBlakeMitchell referee

8407 2018-03-17 19:29:36 We should close the oil off from bc you would be all screwed.All those paid protesters that block the trans pipe line they all drive to work  or use a vehicle oh wait I use oil every day .

8409 2018-03-17 19:29:08 Guinness on St. Patrick’s Day. Motor oil might be better for me, ha ha.
8410 2018-03-17 19:29:08 While I agree that he's been put in a tough spot,his greed & power grab is essentially as dangerous.
Russia to stay relevant needs more oil, trade & influence over other nations, just like US. So, it's not just reactionary forces."The New Rome" complex is still alive in Russia.
8411 2018-03-17 19:28:55 Oh but he's shown the establishment he's gonna virtue signal at Trump given any opportunity so you better believe there's gonna be book deals, TV spots, maybe his own show, etc....
8412 2018-03-17 19:28:54 Coconut oil seems to be popular. Which coconut oil do you use? Did you also get it from umoyo?
8413 2018-03-17 19:28:49 ya, im no anarcho-capitalist. i do think that tech wealth gets used more productively than other wealth.. look at angel investor culture, hard to find similar patterns with like oil or railroad wealth
8414 2018-03-17 19:28:30 @marksandspencer  I don't know who is 'specially selecting' the 'British potatoes' in your crinkle-cut chips offering but they are truly tasteless, even though coated with sunflower oil. 
#neveragain
8415 2018-03-17 19:27:49 I only wanted my car oil changed. Pero, my rear tires need to be replaced now. 
8416 2018-03-17 19:27:34 When I grow up I want to wait forever for an oil change!  Said no one ever.

8418 2018-03-17 19:27:11 Just rinsed yesterday's product out of my hair; waiting for it to dry, then I'll apply my first home-made hair mask! 1 egg, 2 tbsp mayo, 1 tbsp each of coconut and olive oil, honey, and half an avocado! Will sit in that for 30 min w/ a shower cap, then shampoo and condition!
8419 2018-03-17 19:27:04 I hate black porn scenes that's using all that unnecessary ass baby oil... Im tryna get my nut in and I can’t even tell  if the pussy wet cause they done sprayed/pour soul glow all over the bitch 
8420 2018-03-17 19:27:00 We’ve heard the same thing about oil  and mineral companies in the past. We got burned a little on it with messes, so we are a little gun shy. The money would be nice though. Currently our county commission shut them down.
8421 2018-03-17 19:26:36 Your finianacially destroying our kids future, you hypocrite! You allow raw sewage to be dumped into oceans and water ways. You punish the cleanest most ethical oil in the world and allow the world's dirtiest, most unethical blood oil into Canada by the tanker full. Shame on you.
8422 2018-03-17 19:26:28 Kalau dah pakai chemical exfoliate, tak perlu pakai physical dah. Oil cleanser guna tak?
8423 2018-03-17 19:26:21 Oh right so he’s Egyptian so he doesn’t support City okay lad, answer this.. who did you support before the oil money? Get gone, bellend
8424 2018-03-17 19:26:20 Big pressed that all the super lubes doing half off oil changes the day after I got mine.
8425 2018-03-17 19:26:18 Unless Sauds/Qatar/UAE want to lose their business to Russia, they will toe the line. And US is in their pocket.  Either way, China wins.  And if US disrupts oil route, EVERYONE in the world will turn against them. Remember it is not only going to China.
8426 2018-03-17 19:26:14 Yes, the purpul oil, love it and even introduced some ladies at work to it.

8429 2018-03-17 19:26:06 Just imagine, a world without such creatures! I was telling a woman of plight of Orangutans/Palm oil.She laughed at me & said "sure when would I ever see an Orang utan?" as if that was the deciding factor?She has grandchildren!Ppl are so removed from nature.She has plastic plants
8430 2018-03-17 19:26:04 I had no idea that beard oil was a real thing. I thought @RikRankin was pulling my leg.
8431 2018-03-17 19:25:49 Yeah Robby gets pretty triggered over anything related to Stro. It's actually pretty cute to watch jealousy in action.
8432 2018-03-17 19:25:24 So the anti pipeline oil sands groups pay their own way... I call bullshit to that.
8433 2018-03-17 19:25:19 Lucas Oil Team Geriatric and Tony Lynch are out at Silverstone this weekend for the 1st round of the British Rallycross
8434 2018-03-17 19:25:12 Agreed > Send the global price of oil and gas into a free fall, sanctions on industry, banks (off SWIFT), and individuals, trade blockade, expel Russia businesses, seize properties and assets, close RT and Spunik, and finally  ..... expel Russian nationals. Russia would collapse.
8435 2018-03-17 19:25:07 why do you think that? Putin wants to sell gas and oil, Trump is trying to avoid this with sanctions to sell us his costly shale gas. It's all about money.
8436 2018-03-17 19:24:48 Cali for sure
8437 2018-03-17 19:24:48 Ohh...super...can u oil me

8439 2018-03-17 19:24:45 @permabear_uk - Perma, like energy here? Seems crazy how low things are compared to price of oil now
8440 2018-03-17 19:24:36 Feels a bit like trying to clean up an oil spill with a mop - investigation can’t keep up with pace of new crimes
8441 2018-03-17 19:24:18 I will feel better if McCabe is locked up.
8442 2018-03-17 19:23:49 He's also lieing about the First Nations in Alberta that are directly affected by the oil sands. Those Bands have not opposed the oil sands for decades and just recently signed new agreements.
8443 2018-03-17 19:23:46 Hmm..u do oil bath for yugadi?
8444 2018-03-17 19:23:40 I think this might be a case where different conditions lead to different experiences of similar concepts. Like, I get ADHD intrusive thoughts which are often more like “drink that entire bottle of cooking oil”, as well as BPD intrusive thoughts which...

8447 2018-03-17 19:23:06 The nice people in Mad Max 2 are really into scarfs and wraps - so I'm adding this to my head canon for the film. Also the bad guys are clearly short of clothes - so maybe the conflict was never about oil at all - it was a knitware based disparity.
8448 2018-03-17 19:22:27 And I wonder who should be believed, an internaut that googled through all the misinformation of the oil industry or the scientist which neutrality reputation is on the line.
8449 2018-03-17 19:22:26 Mar 21, 2017 - To see the state of Vladimir Putin's economy, look down at Russians’ feet. ... Under President Putin, Russia's economy has seen real income drop for the third consecutive year, poverty up by 15 percent as global oil prices remain low. Putin's woes stem from its oil
8450 2018-03-17 19:22:26 Wonder how nobody ever told me that if you let oil over heat and you pour pepper, the thing can catch fire from inside the pot and burn your hand. 

Who's going to call 911?
8451 2018-03-17 19:22:24 IM GONNA CRY WHAT THE FUCK BRO CHANGE MY OIL IN MY TRUCK OR SUCK MY DICK #bye
8452 2018-03-17 19:22:14 What’s your thoughts on the fact that Russia also supply’s 50% of the coal used in the UK? Oh, and 13% of all the Oil used in the UK? Happy now?
8453 2018-03-17 19:21:25 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!

8458 2018-03-17 19:20:35 I literally posted a screenshot of your words.  I'm not distorting them.  You said that firearms as a hobby "do not benefit the country" as a response to that being a reason to own firearms.
8459 2018-03-17 19:20:29 Gov #Wike has not done anything in Rivers State! Just playing politics with oil money. Yeye man! @tvcnewsng @EstherTVCnews
8460 2018-03-17 19:20:20 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @theroygreenshow Roy for 30 years we have heard the spin " we need oil etc to fund social programs " yet over those 30 years we have seen social programs\healthcare etc. gutted ( homeless people etc.)-- so Mr Roy history shows your argument is specious at best
8461 2018-03-17 19:20:05 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

8473 2018-03-17 19:17:40 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.

8506 2018-03-17 19:11:13 America hasn't been the greatest nation for long time.

Too much aggressiveness in advancing their agenda, w/ no concern for how it impact rest of world.

Wars over oil, invisible boundaries, etc.

But America will always have this perspective - its engrained in them from birth.

His mountebank/snake oil salesman like penchant for blustering & bullying prevarication somehow in their minds, "MAGA." Huh?

8516 2018-03-17 19:09:55 Jason wilson is a not so guardian"Guardian" writer,who seriously should be boiled in oil.Wilson's  spurious claims /assertions are so racist that his closed eyes comments abide  violence against SA white Farmers.He's a Lima declaration Fan,a hyena& a dissembling Cad and Bounder.
8517 2018-03-17 19:09:34 This thing of applying for jobs online is rubbish...now where do I pour the annointing oil papa gave me? On the memory stick or on the whole computer...where? Tell me now, where!?

8521 2018-03-17 19:08:57 He can’t be worried he would be rather happy that he is still in tight grip of the country holding unilateral uninterrupted power and a coveted control on the natural resources asset of the country and oil and gas worth trillions and counting who cares about general people #
8522 2018-03-17 19:08:39 Hi..nak tanye does micellar water act the same as oil cleanser? Does it enough to use only micellar water? BTW I'm not using a heavy makeup..
8523 2018-03-17 19:08:37 My timeline rlly got that oil based cleanser huh-no i heart radio hashtags eVERYWHERE FOR EVERY TWEET
8524 2018-03-17 19:08:35 It's become a fair thread Kevin, there is a future for chemical engineering graduates in the oil business and Scotland needs them
8525 2018-03-17 19:08:32 Sudan just lost most of their oil. Their research is pending, and NO breakthroughs have been discovered.
8526 2018-03-17 19:08:26 Just imagine if people working in other sectors as security, education, oil and gas e.t.c come out and tell us the rot in the system as those in the health sector are lamenting?

May God save us from us!
8527 2018-03-17 19:08:24 For instance, given what some American newspaper say, I could think that any American is a racist white men ready to kill for a drop of oil.
8528 2018-03-17 19:08:09 I wonder which state the "little green men" are going to invade first. Probably Alaska. It's the closest, they have a lot of oil and Don Jr's actually supported the idea of giving it back to Russia in the past...
8529 2018-03-17 19:08:08 Call him
8530 2018-03-17 19:08:00 You’re Rex Tillerson. You leave it all to profit from a Russian oil deal but you can’t pull it off, so your dismissed with the same crass indifference you showed to the American people. #Rosneft
8531 2018-03-17 19:07:51 Wow. And I'm not a big Spec fan myself, but somewhere along the line you deserve every negative comment you get on this one.
8532 2018-03-17 19:07:49 They don’t even understand, because there’s no oil on them yet
8533 2018-03-17 19:07:44 Not the best time to run out of heating oil  #beastfromtheast2 #extralayers
8534 2018-03-17 19:07:35 Have you left, been gone awhile and then flown back in? The first whiff smells like crude oil. As does some of the highways.
8535 2018-03-17 19:07:25 It's not a cure. It's a yreatment. I'm in the CBD oil industry.
8536 2018-03-17 19:07:24 Dipped in coconut oil 
8537 2018-03-17 19:07:22 did he really leave the oil industry?
8538 2018-03-17 19:07:06 Got my oil changed and missed all of the first period. Based on the crowd size in Sunrise, I guess everyone in Florida is also getting their oil changed #Oilers #emptyseats
8539 2018-03-17 19:06:54 Macam serum, tapi face oil ni utk lembapkan kulit muka.. untuk kulit yg kering should use face oil
8540 2018-03-17 19:06:42 You can't put a bullet in a pipeline, fire that bullet at the coast and then be amazed that you kill something. Safety first. Learn how to protect the orcas and effectively clean up oil spills before pushing more of it through the coast.
8541 2018-03-17 19:06:32 Agreed. My other current pet hate at the moment  is ‘snake oil’. A very nasty way of dismissing something you happen to disagree with. Best reserved for proven conmen rather than other educationalists.
8542 2018-03-17 19:06:27 I am literally sweating coconut oil under this dryer I can wait to see my shirt after this 
8543 2018-03-17 19:06:13 Whale oil beef hooked
8544 2018-03-17 19:06:09 I used butter as a sub for oil, so let’s hope these even taste ok when they’re done
8545 2018-03-17 19:06:02 Fair enough
8546 2018-03-17 19:05:59 Getting to my oil change place to discover their computers are down so they can’t touch my car until the systems are back up...I’ll be sitting here a while.

8548 2018-03-17 19:05:31 my day has consisted of an oil change, cartoons, and hosing a kid covered in shit off in a laundry tub... how's your St.Paddys going?
8549 2018-03-17 19:05:18 Such intelligence dazzles me, especially the grasp of the English language, expertise on guns, deep understanding of political dynamics, and how with all this seems to miss the face that the left believes is too immature to own a gun and just the type of voter they love. Doh!
8550 2018-03-17 19:05:06 Oil.
8551 2018-03-17 19:04:49 A lavender-rose skin oil would be a wondrous thing. @KorresUSA wyd?

8560 2018-03-17 19:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
8561 2018-03-17 19:02:17 Going to islamiyya tonight will be a  risk, with this hadari n almost raining weather,even Malam no go come
8562 2018-03-17 19:02:16 Whoa... my local oil change places charge $50 and $60 for a dexos oil change and WalMart only charges $35! I can’t even buy the stuff and do it myself for that price!
8563 2018-03-17 19:02:15 The United States is proud of you! Delaying a pipeline which would allow Canadian oil to access foreign markets. Now they can export their increased oil production without competition from Canada. The profits will be used to expand their oil industry even more.
8564 2018-03-17 19:02:15 Dearest Andrew - good news - we all get ESPN now, even here in the cow pastures. You must rest and can be assured we have heard of this news.  Even tweeting needlessly impacts your holstered side arm. PS how is your supply of possum oil salve? Love Mom.
8565 2018-03-17 19:01:54 This chicken is being roasted with lemon, rosemary, salt/pepper/olive oil, and about 35 cloves of wet garlic. I have much excite.
8566 2018-03-17 19:01:51 Afric Oil is the parent company originally owning all your every year names changing companies tell me if i’m wrong ? 
Changing a name can full stupid people only not everyone unfortunately...

8570 2018-03-17 19:01:23 It is truly frightening that so many people shun science and believe the snake oil peddlers. Face Book clearly complicit in the charade of the charlatans.

8576 2018-03-17 19:01:00 If you are prone to acne, be sure to keep hot oil treatments or heavy hair conditioners away from your bangs and hairline. This can cause breakouts. #protip
8577 2018-03-17 19:00:53 Just got in the car and need a oil change like can a girl win ????
8578 2018-03-17 19:00:49 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
8579 2018-03-17 19:00:45 also their fries are soggy bc they use cottonseed oil lmao. that shits evil.
8580 2018-03-17 19:00:30 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
8581 2018-03-17 19:00:23 3. I make considerable effort to be widely read – much further afield than the Tyee, Guardian, even Alberta Oil Magazine.
4. The transition to renewables is happening globally; Canada is just way behind.  This (even in a neoliberal version of ECON 101) is not good economics.

8584 2018-03-17 19:00:02 Yup also expect disinformation/snake oil in crypto to  so many it seems are so clueless which @Ripple's fidget spinner scam token and @NEO_Blockchain's market cap prove unfortunately 
8585 2018-03-17 18:59:59 Ooh! I don't use milk of any sort. I do use extra-light olive oil instead of butter.
8586 2018-03-17 18:59:57 The only modern car @FiatChrysler_NA even makes is the 500eeeeeee. I plan to buy one just to flaunt it in Marchione’s face. If he wasn’t so deep in Big Oil’s pants, he’d sell 500e’s globally. Most fun I’ve ever had on 4 wheels, and so cheap! Plus the most reliable @fiat ever!

8590 2018-03-17 18:59:09 Again; facts don’t lie. Afric Oil was acquired in 2017, Block 3 in 2010/11. Do some research then we can engage. Thank You.

8602 2018-03-17 18:57:12 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
8603 2018-03-17 18:56:59 How do you let all of the wealth of that family leave that family for a third wife? I can understand if it was the first wife who helped him build the Empire but the third wife? 

That's like Anna Nicole making off with billions from that oil guy! 

Dumb
8604 2018-03-17 18:56:53 Let’s us all be factual then, from Afric Oil a fuel distribution Company to acquiring the block 3 in Congo what was the financial capacity of your company back then ? This deal is the biggest ever you had why then getting rid of it so quickly by calling @Total to farm-in ?
8605 2018-03-17 18:56:51 Yeah, go on, If you don’t mind! I will swap you for that Double Chin Double Neck Oil I got for you. 
8606 2018-03-17 18:56:41 Unfortunately, free education and free healthcare would be impossible for a 300 million ppl country like the US. Norway is oil rich and has 4 million people. Sweden is not much bigger. Even with oil, taxes in Norway are over 60%. For life saving, they choose private healthcare.
8607 2018-03-17 18:56:38 Arbenz redistributed land that Standard Fruit was profiting off of. Mosadeggh nationalized Iran’s oil. Allende redistributed land and empowered labor. Qaddafi nationalized Libya’s oil and was working on a pan African currency based on the dinar to compete with the Afro franc.

8620 2018-03-17 18:54:41 From Haydn's Dict. of Dates c1863:- BUTTER. It was late before the Greeks had any notion of butter and by the early Romans it was used only as medicine - never as food. The Christians in Egypt burnt butter in their lamps instead of oil...
Burnt butter! Ugh...

Here is the secret, what if it was 1 oil baron in Dubai, who was worried that the price might shoot past 70$ before he could get all he wanted and just bought that ladder up. How many more oil barons can we take before mybit hits 300$+?

8649 2018-03-17 18:50:35 Almond shower oil gets rave reviews from my gift recipients here as well.
8650 2018-03-17 18:50:24 And CBD oil is great if you don’t want the high.  A couple of drops under my tongue and I’m out for the night.
8651 2018-03-17 18:50:07 burned myself with oil today so thats going to S U C K haha ha
8652 2018-03-17 18:50:05 RT @BKgrooming: Going for a ride this weekend?  Protect your nether regions with our Machine Oil. Packed with soothing castor and coconut oils, it'll help give you a chaffe-less ride.
8653 2018-03-17 18:50:04 The refineries in their state who benefit from cheap Alberta oil when we can’t send it anywhere else.
8654 2018-03-17 18:50:02 that it would hurt jobs unloading Saudi oil tankers. Trudeau ... great leadership
8655 2018-03-17 18:49:43 @lirarandall RUSSIA RUNS ON 50 PERCENT OIL HARMEIN COMPLACENT TO GIVING RUSSIA WORLD POWER AND DRIVING AMERICA IN GROUND WITH RUSSIA
8656 2018-03-17 18:49:43 @buglesofficial why do you add coconut oil to a product that never had it. You do realize some people are allergic to coconut and when you add it without notice it can and has caused problems. How about a label saying you've added it?
8657 2018-03-17 18:49:36 Anybody want ramping into an o&g e&p co. 13+bn prospective barrels of oil, major partners, $3mn cash, 2 giant drills 2018 subject to partner & a drill middle 2019 of at least 130mmboe net funded by majors (twice size of char drill). Bit of proven too. Valued at £10mn then Dm me
8658 2018-03-17 18:49:27 The key is flavored coffee!! I use a hazelnut vanilla blend. Add 1 tbsp of coconut oil, 1 tbsp butter, 1 tsp of organic stevia, a splash of vanilla & a dash of cinnamon. Blend blend blend 
8659 2018-03-17 18:49:09 Actually coconut oil is a new trend in US
8660 2018-03-17 18:49:03 Groundnut oil
8661 2018-03-17 18:48:55 I think you people should move out of the way and let grownups deal with climate change. Even the oil industry knows something must be done.
8662 2018-03-17 18:48:44 niao: how do I know if the oil's ready?
every single one of my uncles: put your hand inside.

8664 2018-03-17 18:48:16 She's doing more in just a few years then your party did in 9. You unregulated most of the Canadian Lakes and threw billions at oil giants to destroy the lands of Natives. As for First Nations, you polluted their water asshole!
8665 2018-03-17 18:48:13 I think it would be more accurate to say that it's based within a lineage of a specific strange of left anti-imperialism (e.g.
“Nato is an engine for the delivery of oil to the oil companies and the major nations of this world, make no illusions about that.”)

8666 2018-03-17 18:48:00 Jim get your facts straight, Syria is not fighting a civil war. It is fighting a US invasion by proxy forces. The US is working the Greater Israel project on behalf of its friends, Israel. The petrodollar and Genie Oil and Gas are incidental reasons for the stealthy attack.
8667 2018-03-17 18:47:59 カラオケオールしてますw
8668 2018-03-17 18:47:46 What exactly is the national interest Trudeau is supporting?Is it sustainable oil production from Alberta & Saskatchewan or the environmental folks opposed to pipeline construction.Seems like he prefers to deconstruct the oil industry to save face from his environmental dilemma
8669 2018-03-17 18:47:44 Definitely not in the long term except?
1) NNPC refineries work
2) Dangote refinery starts production
3) Modular refineries start working
4)Price of crude oil falls to less than $60/bbl.

8674 2018-03-17 18:47:04 I hope Alberta cuts off BC's oil supply soon. And I live in BC.

8676 2018-03-17 18:46:51 One of my favorite monopoly stories is Standard Oil being too damn lazy to think up new names for all the new companies it was broken up into. So you got things like Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of California and Standard Oil of New York--
8677 2018-03-17 18:46:50 Thank you for your inquiry, would you mind sending us a DM so we can send you some info about our Palm Oil use.
8678 2018-03-17 18:46:44 They should walk there if there against oil
8679 2018-03-17 18:46:42 Lol
8680 2018-03-17 18:46:03 That’s a shame, we can’t drink money or eat coins ... or breath oil ... the animals are here for a purpose, I am becoming convinced man is a giant plague upon the earth
8681 2018-03-17 18:45:56 On potential playoff teams or teams that have been out of the race for ages? Those are two different animals.
8682 2018-03-17 18:45:48 $1 Prerolls! $1 Grams of Flower! $10 Grams of Oil!
8683 2018-03-17 18:45:46 Stir together 3 cups honey with 8 oz Cabbage. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with a nice chianti.
8684 2018-03-17 18:45:45 Maryam you got a point but the stubborness of a girl can not be compared to that of a man.
8685 2018-03-17 18:45:31 I actually held it all together until I got in the car. It’s gonna take me about two months to grow them back as thick as they were... if I’m lucky! Here’s to tons of castor oil 
8686 2018-03-17 18:45:28 (Still it is better than the "Cannabis Oil cures cancer so stop taking your chemotherapy" thread I came across in a local FB group the other day.)
8687 2018-03-17 18:45:20 I love coconut oil.
8688 2018-03-17 18:45:09 Once done using a drill bit, clean it off and put a light coat of oil on it to increase its lifespan.
8689 2018-03-17 18:45:07 i’m trying out this sample of a vitamin c serum in oil form and it’s working really nicely but. i’m gonna need to find something else i can’t stand it..... non-active oils i try to mix in w something so i can make less of it stretch over my whole face if that makes sense
8690 2018-03-17 18:45:05 Don’t get me started  I worked on BP Forties Field at its peak. Basically the billions in oil revenue taxes funded Maggie’s Falkland Islands and Miners’ destruction. At the same time she cancelled school milk  Do things ever change?
8691 2018-03-17 18:44:58 My plum custard body wash + my almond shower oil work well together like milk and cookies. I kind of don't want to use anything else ever again.
8692 2018-03-17 18:44:57 “You got some baby oil?” Lmao
8693 2018-03-17 18:44:44 The smell of peppermint oil >>>
8694 2018-03-17 18:44:28 In Eichel’s case, for me, if he is cleared and he wants to it shouldn’t be an issue regardless of personal stats. It’s his call.
8695 2018-03-17 18:44:23 With all of the research on the benefits of a plant-based diet, I am going to try & replace one meal a day with just vegetables.  Just made a tray of roasted asparagus & broccoli topped with nutritional yeast & a side of roasted turnips + coconut oil. Who is this girl?! 
8696 2018-03-17 18:44:18 まだ起きてんのかいw
8697 2018-03-17 18:44:13 Sure, Ronna, keep selling your snake oil, just like @POTUS. Conor Lamb won in PA18, @SenDougJones won in AL, many other Dems winning in state legislatures, by meeting & talking to ppl about issues that matter.

8703 2018-03-17 18:43:42 PSA: if you are going to Supermac's, go there on Thursday or Friday. They change the cooking oil on Thursdays
8704 2018-03-17 18:43:30 Also don't use plastic products & other petroleum products. Don't travel on paved roads. All that stuff could have elements of AB & SK oil.

8709 2018-03-17 18:43:01 So, on average about 200 000 Litres of Oil spilled from #KinderMorgan every 2-3 years. Enough to kill off #salmon runs forever.
8710 2018-03-17 18:42:59 Oil Man Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout by Elevation Beer Company found at Lucky Pie. Get it before it's gone!
8711 2018-03-17 18:42:52 I’ve gotten close, you need a lot of grease, butter, oil, what have you. Heat is key as well.
8712 2018-03-17 18:42:45 In the future... 

Canada - "alright USA, you owe us 10 trillion US dollars for all that oil and shit youve been taking for over a hundred years, pay up" 

USA - "here's half a bitcoin and an ounce of gold"

Canada - "thanks, here's your change"

8713 2018-03-17 18:42:44 wait so that doesn’t work...it sorta worked for me but it was baking soda, lemon juice, peppermint & lavender oil. well shit...someone help my face out!!
8714 2018-03-17 18:42:43 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
8715 2018-03-17 18:42:43 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8716 2018-03-17 18:42:41 dude what why are you putting palm oil in bread
8717 2018-03-17 18:42:16 I bet Wilson sits last couple of games in DC if not for playoff chase, but it’s just a guess.
8718 2018-03-17 18:42:13 Gross darkness with some pepper & oil and you are good to go 
8719 2018-03-17 18:41:48 Rex is the luckiest dog alive. A repugnant oil company CEO, who publicly ate shit for Trump and ruined State from the inside, but somehow he's the good boy in all of this.
8720 2018-03-17 18:41:38 Venezuela’s problem is not socialism but corruption (as happens in most of latin america). Norway has a state-run oil company also, but it’s a rich developed country.
8721 2018-03-17 18:41:37 Teachers are clueless, confused by an ever changing curriculum and most trying to follow a text book. The apprenticeship program needs the backing it just isn't getting. My only advice is pick a main player engineering company in aviation, automotive or oil & gas 
8722 2018-03-17 18:41:37 20 min oil change for 57.00
8723 2018-03-17 18:41:30 every day Trump has a toddler tantrum, a famous mouse wants to become politician

8725 2018-03-17 18:41:23 I like to use an oil like Balm Balm's Miracle Oil, then a moisturiser like Kimberley Sayer's SPF one (although not 100% sure if thats vegan). For make up I swear by Ere Perez Arnica Concealer with PHB loose mineral foundation -these two make my skin so dewy with great coverage.
8726 2018-03-17 18:41:09 If you want to "fuck socialism"...something you clearly don't understand, then you had better do something about the sellout weasel you put in the WH before the official language of the US becomes Russian & we are all subservient to one oil metabolism stretching from Moscow to DC
8727 2018-03-17 18:41:08 That’s the stuff....and the old gloves with real leather are the best...just restring, oil them and away you
8728 2018-03-17 18:40:46 I don’t know their injuries, so hard to say. That’s the issue, we will never know. 
But to your point, mine is more of guys shutting it down when things go bad. Not always for bad intentions.

8736 2018-03-17 18:39:23 Congress  steered the economy out of the mess when the world collapsed in 2008. They were in power when oil was 140 usd/barrel. BJP had a very favourable oil regime ( mostly  40 usd) and still they complain? . If they were so good, why didnt they come to power 60 years ago ?
8737 2018-03-17 18:39:15 For soup, cook crushed ginger in oil, then simmer with beef, curry powder, mushroom broth and kale. Top with rosemary.
8738 2018-03-17 18:39:02 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
8739 2018-03-17 18:38:54 There are so many reasons why cannabis oil should be trialled & legalised but theres only one reason why it won't be.... and its that theres too much money in prescription meds than there would be in cannabis. Simple.

8746 2018-03-17 18:38:01 Only 25? What are the other 49% @HouseDemocrats doing? It's disheartening how so many #CongressionalDemocrats point out WH atrocities but have nearly #ZERO follow thru. If you're not taking action, you're condoning Trump & his minions. A squeaky wheel still squeaks w/o oil!
8747 2018-03-17 18:37:55 I make a mix of 90 % corn, 9% flour and 1 % cornstarch. Then salt, oil and boiling water. That’s my hack for tortillas.

You gonna get all this hydration..
8792 2018-03-17 18:31:51 It's a long standing idea that we try not to trample all of the countryside, so that we don't have to go abroad to find stuff that isn't full of oil wells, motorways, car parks, shopping centres, housing estates. Call me old fashioned, but I think the idea has merit.

8816 2018-03-17 18:29:44 That's good! Just had a little peep at the botanics oil though and that's such a good price! Do you use that one in the morning and do you think it helps with oil control?

But can it have a mid-life crisis in a world without oil?
8830 2018-03-17 18:28:05 Why are Facebook, Google, Amazon etc. not facing the same antitrust accusations that AT&T, Standard Oil and many other companies with similar market share have faced over the years? They were forced to break up, so should these modern tech monopolies.

8832 2018-03-17 18:27:58 Are you sure its a good idea to oil yourself up needlessly? I mean it does conduct electricity pretty well...
8833 2018-03-17 18:27:56 being a carefree black girl isn’t putting baby oil on your body and flowers in your hair. it’s eating hot cheetos out of a sheet of paper for breakfast and yelling “BESTFRAAAAAN” at 6:52 am.
8834 2018-03-17 18:27:50 The lady who cut my hair just sprayed this coconut oil stuff on it and I am living my absolute best life rn. That smell 
8835 2018-03-17 18:27:48 I work in the Offshore oil gas and renewables. Last year installing Hywind. Turbines heavily subsidised, ending this year and will probably put off companies. They are only in it for the money. Nothing else...

8838 2018-03-17 18:26:54 And if tOSU is down 2 and snyder cant do it in the last match, does tan tom just melt into a pool of tanning oil?
8839 2018-03-17 18:26:50 I still can't believe we're still using that much gas and oil in the 21st century.
8840 2018-03-17 18:26:27 You don't put any water in there. You don't put the lid on. You do weigh it down so the bottom gets all the heat it can. You do put just a bit of oil down so nothing sticks. You do wait a bit. You do get crispy bacon. You do have weird dishes to do.
8841 2018-03-17 18:26:26 HK of course is good place for selfi , meanwhile this news is obsolete and faulty. Ask CIA people why they need to imitate chemical attack in Syria. USA wants to have access to oil there, does it?
8842 2018-03-17 18:26:22 Natural Beauty Tip for Fair skin:- 

Apply a few drops of pure castor oil on your face and massage it well.

Leave it for half an hour or so, and then wipe with a wet cloth.
8843 2018-03-17 18:26:10 Reliable but don't neglect oil & filter changes because the timing chain will stretch and it's quite involved job to change it. Engine compartment fuseboxes can suffer from bad contacts causing melting and electrical issues but on the whole they are tough, reliable cars.

8845 2018-03-17 18:25:47 That’s just it, why is it our responsibility to take care of countries  that mismanage their money? The presidents or PM keep the money for themselves and let their people starve and die! Look at the ME and all the oil they have in their land but the money is kept by rich men!
8846 2018-03-17 18:25:29 If I don't wake up tomorrow its because I've used a chemical oil on loads of things in the house and i forgot I couldn't open the windows so yeah bye world 
8847 2018-03-17 18:25:20 Need to go cop that beard oil today.
8848 2018-03-17 18:25:10 Who knows, hope he does well though.
8849 2018-03-17 18:24:58 I think the numbers state how much we are dependant on oil. Think of all the oil required to produce the renewable infrastructure. Everything is moved by diesel truck or ship. See energy skeptic - when trucks stop running.
8850 2018-03-17 18:24:55 Ford told me my oil change would be an hour. It’s now been 2 hours and due to my boredom I have 3 amazon packages being delivered on Monday. What is wrong with me.

8852 2018-03-17 18:24:41 Sounds more legit than coconut oil 
8853 2018-03-17 18:24:37 In case you read this, can you please put some leadership into a solution to the flooding along the Mississippi and droughts in the west? If we can store and pipe oil thousands of miles, why can’t we do the same with water? I know it’s not simple. It IS achievable with willpower.

8863 2018-03-17 18:22:31 Adulting is spending your hard earned money on getting your oil changed on Saturday morning.

8868 2018-03-17 18:21:39 Who knew it would so hard to get a oil change 
8869 2018-03-17 18:21:39 I get the point you're trying to make, but the cure for cancer has already been found - CBD oil extracted from Cannabis plants.
8870 2018-03-17 18:21:17 No chance I’m good at the oil market but pretty useless for everything else. Lyrics are intro to Irish song: McApline’s Fusiliers
8871 2018-03-17 18:21:16 Natural Beauty Tip for Fair skin:- 

A mixture of olive oil and sea salt is needed. The ratio of the mixture must be two to one. 

Applying this body scrub and massage for a few minutes. Rinse with cool water.
8872 2018-03-17 18:20:52 They won’t go away but I’ve heard bio oil helps fade them. Also there’s a lot of other products that are targeted for post pregnancy stretch marks that will work very well too (if you’re really set on fading them).

8874 2018-03-17 18:20:37 So do you insure a lot of oil companies that are going to be sued? #CleanAir #AirPollutionDeaths More People Have DIED from Air Pollution than All Wars Combined. AND Your oh So Loved Oil Pollution Hits Babies and Seniors First!
8875 2018-03-17 18:20:36 You obviously ignored the "us win" portion in his next sentence. He was quite clearly responding to a question from his point of view...hence the use of the word "my". I get Stroman is not everyone's cup of tea but let's not make something out of nothing.
8876 2018-03-17 18:20:09 Oil money never runs dry.
8877 2018-03-17 18:19:57 The oil sands went through a lengthy process of technological improvement at the same time as global oil prices fluctuated. The federal government helped at different stages including the first one.
8878 2018-03-17 18:19:52 Yes. The oil man who willfully destroys the earth deserves our sympathy.

8882 2018-03-17 18:19:28 Most are atheists here so there is no reason to do any good when ungratefulness is the only wages we can expect. We just enjoy the oil money and shitpost on twitter.
8883 2018-03-17 18:19:06 @smerconish Agree fully...they're all getting too big, but why not add microsift to the technolohy monsters? And how about the oil giants that have been controlling us and our governments for years?

8887 2018-03-17 18:17:51 @EA Remember Road Rash? The games past Road Rash 3 weren't so great, but Road Rash 3 was awesome. Nunchucks, Mace, Cattle Prods, Crowbars, Chains, Clubs, Oil Slicks, and even the ability to kick your opponents off their bike. You should re-make a game like this, only with more
8888 2018-03-17 18:17:50 No. Starting with simple but strategic changes like #oil contracts in #reminbi or #euros or #renminbi as #IMF reserve currency, the multipolar #financial system adjusts differently to systemic stress next time.

8892 2018-03-17 18:17:38 The people who insist our demands for m4a amd free college and a living wage and criminal juatice reform are gonna lead to totalitarian corporatocracy are caping for the former second highest ranking cop in america and the world's most powerful oil magnate.

8894 2018-03-17 18:17:07 I also bartered some food so someone would change my oil in my car. I'm really living the American dream.
8895 2018-03-17 18:16:58 That’s a very good point. Fancy new buildings and they tell you they don’t make any money on new cars. I’ve started pushing my oil changes closer to what the manual says but do agree the intervals are based on perfect driving conditions
8896 2018-03-17 18:16:43 And I’m bout to pay for 80 dollar oil change lol. Fuck this car

8899 2018-03-17 18:16:12 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8900 2018-03-17 18:15:52 That’s horrible news. These oil spills are getting worse and more difficult to handle.

8920 2018-03-17 18:13:44 drink more water, work out, eat your fruits and vegetables, put coconut oil over your entire body, journal, never stop learning, and life will be ok.
8921 2018-03-17 18:13:31 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
8922 2018-03-17 18:13:27 I think it's almost like when speculators cause a rise or a fall in oil prices. My guess is that it's centered around influence.
8923 2018-03-17 18:13:22 Then you'll have to decide which gets to market, the oil or the grain because if you don't complete/build refineries & replace existing leaky old pipelines like #Line9 that's all that's getting to market. 
8924 2018-03-17 18:13:22 Let's see... the NRA, big Oil, RUSSIA. No, Trump isn't compromised at all by $$$.

8937 2018-03-17 18:11:45 It doesn't skimp, using sea salt and olive oil, making sauces from scratch as well as giving you raw, vegan, gluten-free and dairy-free options. Too good to be true? Check it out for yourself. Order it.

8940 2018-03-17 18:11:30 How many levels of school house rock do you have to be on to think Rex’s assumption of that job had anything to do with public service? Does he look like a singing oil can whistling to “How a US backed Coup Take Place” to you, you simpleton?

8969 2018-03-17 18:08:30 Steel + aluminum = Ontario & Quebec. Oil = Alberta. Political calculations are easy.
8970 2018-03-17 18:08:28 WATCH OUT FOR ENGINE OIL LEAKS!
We tend to neglect these leaks but they deprive the engine of lubrication to vital metal parts.  Overhauling or replacing a poorly maintained engine is one of the costliest avoidable expenses any car owner should wish to incur.
8971 2018-03-17 18:08:00 Nice. Is this a scripted event, or is this based on some AI/gameworld rules (i.e., the NPC just happened to put in too much oil which caused the lamp to explode)?

8973 2018-03-17 18:07:44 And then suddenly, the UK can't get food.  Also, do y'all have the refinery capacity locally?  Sure, you may protect the oil, but if you can't refine it, it's useless.
8974 2018-03-17 18:07:38 I marinate myself in coconut oil every night. It makes everyday sweet.

8981 2018-03-17 18:06:46 You're right. You've got a bit of oil. Really the only thing going for Russia these days. Some model of sustainability.
8982 2018-03-17 18:06:43 nah, why not just sanction his oil, and any country that buys it, the EU just needs to decide do they want the oil and gas more than they want to curb his behavior.
8983 2018-03-17 18:06:28 I would say turn off their oil/gas now but given how most of them look like, I'm guessing public transit and bicycles are their main mode of transportation. A better way to scare them would be to force them to bathe I believe.
8984 2018-03-17 18:06:22 Send the army there to dispel them. Oil will win!

8995 2018-03-17 18:04:29 See ehn I have a story to tell on how i was asked a complete bottle of 'holy' olive oil... Smh. You've said it all.
8996 2018-03-17 18:04:26 the article doesn't even mention that oil prices are the major driver of our economy here in OK.

Low oil prices = less work, less production, and less tax revenue.

Not mentioning that makes it obvious that this is agenda driven shilling for dems and higher taxes, not reporting

9021 2018-03-17 18:00:55 It’s nice to live in a fantasy world. The facts are that oil and gas are still required to produce, manufacture and transport everything. Including your EV’s.
9022 2018-03-17 18:00:34 Well, with aging parents, this guy, and this admin, are all about forbidding and prosecuting a plant and its oil that has far better efficacy and lack of dependency.

Many people look at it all as R vs D. It's not. As a person, as a parent, or a child, etc.

9088 2018-03-17 17:52:19 Went in for an oil change & discovered there is about $1500 worth of damage to the underneath of my car from driving over one of those fake speed bump things at my work MONTHS ago bc it caught underneath and literally dragged. How’s your day going? 
9089 2018-03-17 17:52:18 Maybe we should stop sending 75% of the engineering hours on oil sands projects to them.
9090 2018-03-17 17:51:47 Guy, leave story. You need to focus on Lagos to defend its revenue and what they have used it for and let the Niger Deltans focus on theirs. If the waste it it is no one's business. What has FG done with the 87% they received from oil?

9135 2018-03-17 17:44:56 New phone is officially christened - its been lovingly dabbed with cuticle oil from my fingertips. I'm tryin to get back into the cuticle oil habit because my nails were starting to get really bad.

9138 2018-03-17 17:44:33 Where did you get the coconut oil

9143 2018-03-17 17:44:16 Because we don't know what's in your multivitamin.  B complex alone is probably fine. But if you have fish oil or St. John's Wort mixed in to your multivitamin (among other things we watch for), it can interact with other medications we give or affect your clotting, etc.
9144 2018-03-17 17:44:08 Oil and Gas will fetch same in Nig, if you work offshore.
9145 2018-03-17 17:43:53 Agree with you on Zac,but I almost think he’s more of a reactive player in that with the poor Oil season he hasn’t been able to kick his game up. Unlike last year where success dragged the emotion out of him.A follower rather than a leader scenario.Obviously he needs to find that

9161 2018-03-17 17:41:53 I’m not convinced he’s right. The North Sea is a declining basin. While there’s still oil & gas there, “100’s of years” is simply untrue. The West of Shetland basin has a far better chance of prolonging Scotland’s O&G production than the North Sea.

9167 2018-03-17 17:41:31 Do not overestimate the Russian government: they are too self confident, hence dumb and straightforward in their goals. However, they own oil, gas and nuclear weapons, so the Western world has been allowing their barbaric politics for a long time.

9206 2018-03-17 17:36:56 Anyone who lives in Calgary knows that, Markham. But who forced oil companies to collectively find more supply? To develop the means to exploit tight oil? To drive down costs via efficiencies (automation, etc.)? The oil companies did. High prices drove overproduction.

9223 2018-03-17 17:34:01 Lately, have realized there are more important issues than some prick that didn't fit in the good old boys club. What about the destruction of the world we live in...Fracking for natural gas, oil drilling, destroying our atmosphere.
9224 2018-03-17 17:33:47 Did @realDonaldTrump undermine USA independence in gas & oil exploration, transportation & exportation?

No, that was Obama’s/Clinton
9225 2018-03-17 17:33:46 Though not the wooden trains, I remember adding a drop of oil to an older toy train to let off a curl of smoke as it traveled.

9234 2018-03-17 17:32:47 Asked @BookJedi about ingredients in foot soak we did. Him: oil, lavender.... I heard oil as whale. I sat straight up and shouted, “there’s whale in it???” So now that’s our thing. Is there whale in it?

9249 2018-03-17 17:30:55 Well not sure where your head is at, but not visible, what ever Indians burn if it's an alternative to their usual wood or cow dung, it will actually help the environment. How about you supporting ISIS and human rights abuses for importing ME sourced oil? That's real can't hide

I got recommended this product by my grandson, I was very dubious at first as I had no idea about CBD, after researching and researching I decided to purchase it. At my age and the medication I’m on I didn’t realise anything would help me as much as this oil has.

9255 2018-03-17 17:30:17 The bigger issue is that the lack of pipelines is forcing us to sell the oil to the U.S at a steep discount. Over 90% of our exports go to the U.S they have us over a barrel. The U.S and others have successfully kept us out.. oh we are collectively foolish

9269 2018-03-17 17:27:42 It is not the love of the north that is the problem. That man @MBuhari has never been competent. As oil minister, as ptf chair, as president. He has never been aware of evil things around him, and he is always desperate to lead. Somebody shd tell him leaders take responsibilities

9286 2018-03-17 17:24:43 Think about it. China & Russia already building a oil pipeline. EU should beat them to the punch and buy USA energy. Would help free economies around the world with prosperity. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FoxNews @foxandfriends

9298 2018-03-17 17:23:23 TYPE 1  Straight hair reflects the most sheen, is the most resistant and oily . of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage or  curl this hair texture. Because the sebum oil produced in the scalp glands gently works its way from the scalp to the ends without the interference
9299 2018-03-17 17:23:14 Make oil, from what's left, if any - export ;)
9300 2018-03-17 17:23:11 Hell no like oil and water don’t mix

9303 2018-03-17 17:22:59 Complexity? Maybe. More likely it is the availability of oil rents to subsidize stupidity&high-handed idiocy that encourages such follies.

If Eichel wants to play fine but unless it's b/c he is hoping to reach a bonus as @putzeh suggested, it makes zero sense
9306 2018-03-17 17:22:53 Dave,correct on that but in total About 30% of imported oil comes from Africa etc.. at it does come on tankers down the St. Lawrence. Now imagine if Manitoba said no Car parts made in Ont. will pass through our province and And we imported from Africa no one would have issues??
9307 2018-03-17 17:22:29 Oil on hyenas?

9316 2018-03-17 17:21:22 And yet they undercut the industry in other nations. Not an excuse that your oil wealth is used for that purpose. Could readily charge a competitive fare and still develop your infrastructure and economy.

9344 2018-03-17 17:17:35 Yes I have those figures - Govt figures. Stopped producing them because they showed Scotland only getting back max 45% or so that it was sending to the treasury. Jappy saw figures in 1968 showing same trend even before oil came into the equation.

9368 2018-03-17 17:14:39 If you have a chance, buy oil properties. They can provide royalty checks for generations. With new drilling methods (fracking, etc) wells can be drilled and taken advantage of for much longer. Oil prices will rise with new countries becoming more advanced.

9392 2018-03-17 17:11:19 Yes infrastructure we would not require if oil revenues etc had been distributed and used in a more "equal partners" kind of manner. One only has to go to eastern Europe to see how much can be done regarding infrastructure....then come to SCO to see how little.

9394 2018-03-17 17:11:11 @JoyAnnReid Thank you for connecting the dots today: Pres. Obama's sanctions disrupted a multi-billion dollar oil deal btwn Russia and Exxon Mobile. Removing those sanctions with Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State would have opened the door for POTUS deals.

9427 2018-03-17 17:06:52 The oil fields in Romania had manual valves and handles and such that a worker could just yank about as they saw fit. Not so in Austria. So, I submit to you that “randomly altering values will make a nuclear meltdown” is, if the ICS expert says “not true” then defer to them.

9462 2018-03-17 17:01:02 During WW2 the British had a propaganda campaign aimed at the Romanian oil fileds, slogan “give it a twist”.. idea: oil workers should just give every valve they saw a half turn; impossible to trace, yet certain to damage output. It was relatively successful.
9463 2018-03-17 17:01:00 Are referring to how most of the big oil companies in AB have come out not opposed to c tax? I would think it is because they are pretty confident consumption will not be affected and they will easily pass on cost.

9498 2018-03-17 16:56:02 I pinch the mechanic who did my oil change (he didn’t have on green ... but neither did I ). He pinches me back. Needless to say, his fingers were way more in shape than mine... I was ready to fight.
9499 2018-03-17 16:55:36 Yeah I know all that. Rand Paul called it out in Clinton's 11 hr testimony. But Israel "stealing" oil from Golan is questionable at best. Syria has no ownership rights ro anything in Golan since the 73 war.

9501 2018-03-17 16:55:31 Every generation likes to feel that they are somehow misunderstood and are better than the previous generation. Then we grow up and realize that it was all horse shit. Everything this generation is doing was done by previous generations, they aren’t special.
9502 2018-03-17 16:55:30 I feel like someone legit FUCKING cursed me. First I get the flu 3 days before this wedding and the day before I burn my whole hand with boiling water whilst trying to do a hot oil treatment.
9503 2018-03-17 16:55:15 Why is this even an issue. Stop using Facebook for Christ’s sake. I live in a red oil state that was rabid for trump. My co-workers filled my feed with that shit and I blocked them. It’s breathtaking just how based and stupid people can be. Facebook is a sewer people.

9512 2018-03-17 16:54:07 I’m fairly certain when a girl like myself walks into the auto store to get an oil change the guys behind the counter just think cha-ching

9514 2018-03-17 16:54:04 I hate that my works service department isnt open on the weekends so now instead of using my discount i get to spend triple on an oil change
9515 2018-03-17 16:54:03 #buisnessIdea for #nonprofit:  We take the used oil at eateries and give it at transportation cost to the businesses that use #lubricants. Reduces oil in gutters and creates value in the economy.

9517 2018-03-17 16:53:29 You'd think the constant laundering necessitated by all that dumping baby oil down the front of his trunks that Joey Ryan does would be murder on his gear.
9518 2018-03-17 16:53:28 I can’t decide if MCT oil makes me feel superhuman or very ill.
9519 2018-03-17 16:53:24 Yes, except that you clearly forgot the Girl Scout Law. You're not leading by example by devastating the environment and continuing to enslave us to oil.
9520 2018-03-17 16:53:17 True enough, but in a Putin style lightning/hybrid war scenario could focus first on arming commercial / oil and gas service ships working close to UK waters

9523 2018-03-17 16:53:08 Thanks to the Cops for their timely act. That saved many from from getting entangled in accidents.
However, the Cops must track and take stern action on the Oil tanker Driver, who caused that Oil spill.

9541 2018-03-17 16:50:46 It's metal too and the fluid seems light so it's not oil. Probably brake fluid. Metal is kind of old school by now.

but in the end she is bitter as gall,

Her feet go down to death;
her steps lead straight to the grave.
9579 2018-03-17 16:45:17 You belong in jail.  What you did is beneath contempt.  Actually, you are beneath contempt. A traitorous snake oil salesman.  You need to be sent to one of those private prisons.   Or sent to Russia.
9580 2018-03-17 16:45:14 I don't want to talk about how necessary and overdue my oil change is.

9591 2018-03-17 16:43:51 It is time Europe=(Oil providers etc. to Russia)  make it clear that oil to Russia will be cut off if they interfere with deal with NK, IRAN, Syria etc.
This should be a firm PAC!
9592 2018-03-17 16:43:41 Whale oil beef hooked!
9593 2018-03-17 16:43:38 Yea, the Russians have backed down in Syria and North Korea. Once we get our oil flowing and on the market the Russian economy is in real trouble. Lets not forget that some of our allies are dependant on Russian oil! Like Germany and many others in Europe.
9594 2018-03-17 16:43:37 I've always thought it would be cool to see her as an environmental hero. Batman says he's cool with it as long as she doesn't kill so she travels around defeating oil barons and stuff.
9595 2018-03-17 16:43:28 Only saw your tweet now! It's working. Just needed a little oil. Thanks!
9596 2018-03-17 16:43:26 It’s high time we get over the negativity that there will be a big spill. There are lots of processes and safety checks in place that are paid for by the oil companies. This is well under control and is monitored. As previous said the KM pipeline has been in place Since the 50’s

9607 2018-03-17 16:41:51 ちゅっちゅ！！！
9608 2018-03-17 16:41:43 Finally - Putin is not as strong as we fear. Russian economy and middle class is already struggling - and year by year it will get harder since > 50 %export comes from oil and its production declunes much faster than of other producers. This will destabilize Russia in 15 years.
9609 2018-03-17 16:41:42 Oil change?
9610 2018-03-17 16:41:36 I got an oil change and the kid who helped me gave me a better coupon than the one I had because he “knows the struggle.” There is good in the world !

9613 2018-03-17 16:41:26 If straight white men are so threatened by everyone else, why are they dominating all the things? Shouldn't they be cowering in a corner somewhere?
9614 2018-03-17 16:41:22 Thanks. Consumer nations need SPR, producers not so much. US #EnergyDominance & #OilStandard strategy monetises shale oil/gas reserves via (manipulated) high $ priced oil at consumer expense. I think China Shanghai contract aim is a buy-side benchmark (backed by 1bn bbls SPR)
9615 2018-03-17 16:41:09 Omg I know I'm gonna buy TO's plant-derived squalene very soon because I freakin love how lightweight oil texture (like EUK134) feels on my skin!!

9626 2018-03-17 16:39:56 I think Ferrari is trying to force the previous regs regarding this so they could burn oil again. They seem to have a fuel thirsty engine in 2018.
Oil burning would help.

9636 2018-03-17 16:37:47 Ok! Tea and snack break done. I wasted a bit of time to get the oil changed in my car (which I waited outside for and forgot gloves) but im back to cleaning!
9637 2018-03-17 16:37:36 This Canadian election and ethical oil interference should be neutralized from within. It should be judicially charged as espionage and terrorism to our country.

9640 2018-03-17 16:37:30 I think after this roll bounce (another ~ $2) we may see oil sell off again..if we break $58 funds will start liquidating
9641 2018-03-17 16:37:28 Da vet du sikkert at Esso egentlig er SO og står for Standard Oil ?

9643 2018-03-17 16:37:11 A big part is luck, and there's tons of people preying on the gullible who think it is just a matter of changing their way of thinking... and of course buying books and seminars and other snake oil that they're selling.  Survivors bias is a real thing!

9646 2018-03-17 16:36:45 Those oil paintings are just so GOOOD
9647 2018-03-17 16:36:41 Very informative article.Thank you! Was about to feel sorry for Rex-left with only his $300+million from his time at Exxon and without the billions from lifting sanctions so Rosneft (sp?)/Russian oil deal could proceed. Perhaps his final message being tough on Russia was for show
9648 2018-03-17 16:36:16 How do you get Canada’s oil & gas to markets around the world? Breaking news, it is products like this that pay for all of your benefits, health care,infrastructure,transit,just to name a few,also tens of thousands of jobs, a solar panel & windmill won’t cut it.
9649 2018-03-17 16:36:05 Yeah, we use Olive Oil.
9650 2018-03-17 16:35:40 My gran bought 25 litres of sunflower oil cos it was on offer  #gujjuantics
9651 2018-03-17 16:35:29 This guy literally just paid $2000 worth of repairs on his car with cash...my oil change is $40 and I'm using my card  what is going on?
9652 2018-03-17 16:35:25 It was all a bribe by Trudeau... and now it's clear he's a liar!.. it's been over two years and not one pipeline started...let alone built...he won the election with Foreign interference who want to keep Canada depending on foreign oil...he now has to pay them back..no pipelines.
9653 2018-03-17 16:35:25 It's not so much about the oil, as it is about the sugar you intake. By sugar, I mean more about the processed sugar which is present in soft drinks and pastries, and not white sugar alone. Try to avoid excessive carbs and maida.

On oils specifically, olive oil is healthy.
9654 2018-03-17 16:35:13 I haven't tried it sha... To think I don't even like Palm oil
9655 2018-03-17 16:35:02 Lead them from temptation, make them royalty

9656 2018-03-17 16:34:46 If you have chili, you have to have turmeric, too. And coconut oil for the saturated fats. And bone broth. But only from grass fed non gmo cows in Europe.

9658 2018-03-17 16:34:34 That was because groundnut money is too small to ginger up serious development but it was real labour not a free gift of nature like oil.
9659 2018-03-17 16:34:05 シャイニングは 静謐 好きだー。
9660 2018-03-17 16:33:59 So a US state who buys Canadian oil at bargain basement prices because we don't have a pipeline, doesn't want us to build a pipeline! Shocking! What's disgusting is that our own media won't tell that side of the story, you make @gmbutts proud of you today!
9661 2018-03-17 16:33:45 I do love a facial oil!
9662 2018-03-17 16:33:40 @VinnieTortorich eating this type of salad 5 days a week,  (romaine, cabbage, tomato, pepper, radish, carrot, with chicken, olive oil and white vinegar.  Is that acceptable?
9663 2018-03-17 16:33:24 Most of the Businessman don't consume that they produce by himself.... Mustard oil wala Ghee ya other oil katha hai na ki khud ka.... Mustard oil....  I doubt that it's real news......
9664 2018-03-17 16:33:21 Its pretty clear, despite the fact that his family fortune began with oil money, that he has no respect for the industry. Maybe a psychiatrist can connect the dots on that one.

9673 2018-03-17 16:31:50 It’s not a single pipe.much is quite old & there are joints. Bitumen is much more caustic than oil
9674 2018-03-17 16:31:48 Why does the USA still treat Olive Oil (of which most is labeled EVOO grade) as a commodity vs a premium food? Like Chocolate Cheese or Wine? Let’s chat about this Wednesday at my presentation @WorldOliveOil

9789 2018-03-17 16:16:55 And don't come with the easy peazy "It s your fault West!". You did an excellent job to ingnit that chaos upon yourselves, over which vulture USA and others poured oil for selfish interest.
If you had been fair and united, no one could have done this to you.

9793 2018-03-17 16:16:09 Obama is a slick, smooth-talking, snake oil salesmen. That despicable trait is found in all races.
9794 2018-03-17 16:16:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however without fear about these important and sensitive issues.
9795 2018-03-17 16:16:00 may not finish..but will become irrelevant with Electric cars..47% of crude oil is used for Transport.

9797 2018-03-17 16:15:50 The biggest problem for the anti-oil movement is they don't have anything to replace it. Developing countries are NOT going to stop using coal and oil if it means being trapped in poverty.

9812 2018-03-17 16:14:44 >corbyn vouches for someone worthless >the West Is nice to the people sitting on the most valuable resource ever conceived of by man that we owe all development to. Oil is like real life Vibranium. Its a lynchpin.

9842 2018-03-17 16:11:28 If you roast them in the oven they taste so much better, i say they're actually sweet tasting! All you need is a little olive oil salt and pepper. The ones in the can are not very good. And most people boil them in water and I don't think they taste very good that way!

9844 2018-03-17 16:11:17 I wish I could tell you :/ I had been using olive oil before and had seen some results then switched to Vaseline so maybe a month or so with the Vaseline? Mine were already pretty long as well but it definitely made them thicker!

9902 2018-03-17 16:06:17 That's the story. You pretty much summed it up. Heating oil for the cabin. Bag to knock down the fumes in the car.
9903 2018-03-17 16:06:17 I love using coconut oil, it's great for your skin, hair... well actually pretty much everything.

9905 2018-03-17 16:05:47 I never use coconut oil on my face. That will make you break out. I do put it on my eye area though. My body and my hair 
9906 2018-03-17 16:05:40 And if that's the case, no problem whatsoever. In that situation, there is a reason for it. Though with the amount of time he's missed, I don't think that's the case.

9909 2018-03-17 16:05:17 I've heard the same thing is going on in W. Texas. Wells are becoming progressively more gas and less oil.
9910 2018-03-17 16:05:08 No, you have to dry immediately after washing. Don’t let it air dry. The light apply if oil right after drying will also prevent rust. We don’t let it sit in the sink full of water before washing either.
9911 2018-03-17 16:05:00 Oh you misread or I am bad at the English language. To many people bullish Euro the next move typically would be dollar strength. Similar to when oil is to short or long;

9925 2018-03-17 16:03:45 That's interesting, didn't realize that. Haven't been to Venezuela since Chavez. I imagined the Socialist government would be controlling the universities.

9935 2018-03-17 16:02:28 @SunPatOfficial the shape of your  plastic jars means you can’t get all the peanut butter out the bottom, it’s a real hassle & waste, you get brownie points for not using palm oil but what’s wrong with a straight sided glass jar?

9944 2018-03-17 16:01:49 You'll be fighting big oil companies for the water, guess what, big oil will win. We are no longer a democracy, we are a corporation,and a bankrupt corporation at that, since 1933.#Facts.

March 17, 1978: The oil supertanker Amoco Cadiz runs aground and loses its entire cargo of 1.6 million barrels of oil. An oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long pollutes approximately 200 miles of France’s Brittany coastline.

9965 2018-03-17 15:59:41 We dont have a choice with the Saudis, they supply the world with oil. Fidel castro routinely put gays in punishment camps, he didnt have anything to give the world. But Corbyn loves him, so does Justin Truduea. Its madness

9979 2018-03-17 15:58:00 Proper tail off of the North Sea will happen in under that time , though the reserves will still be there. We are heading towards post oil economies , where Europe wont have any NEW internal combustion engine cars for sale after 2035.

Scotland needs indy or that income is gone.
9980 2018-03-17 15:57:56 I meant the type of oil that would be preferable.
9981 2018-03-17 15:57:51 Well that's a win win for Washington now isn't it.  All part of the plan.  Stop Canadian oil while they ramp up production and reap the benefits.
9982 2018-03-17 15:57:50 Your petition is pointless. It's a democracy and Scot Parliament has mandate to hold another ref. Why are you so anxious to keep us tied to the sinking ship. Oil perhaps? Or our vibrant food industry
9983 2018-03-17 15:57:49 I went to school in the 80s. I had rifles and shotguns the whole time, no one batted an eye, they were in cases in a closet. We hunted regularly. Carried them in and out of dorms all the time, frat house too. Iowa. Nobody cared, nobody was threatened, if they weren't pheasants.
9984 2018-03-17 15:57:31 SPX and easier call than Oil right now. SPX due another dump imminently before a higher high this summer IMHO. Oil could go either way.

9993 2018-03-17 15:56:10 No doubt, stupidity in numbers is something the anti-capitalist, oil hating hypocrites have to their advantage. It will be a pleasure to see more of them charged and locked up before this pipeline is built & flowing black gold

9994 2018-03-17 15:55:55 Read labels don't buy anything with palm oil No demand no more cutting of rain forests  It's a huge impact on the environment  We all can do without palm oil.  Kraft was using it I've seen new things from them without  Call companies tell them you don't buy palm oil products
9995 2018-03-17 15:55:31 @VarsityGamingYT Oi mate, enjoy the content, can’t catch your streams cause of my work schedule, but enjoy the YouTube content. Quick question though, since you’re from Canada which province are ya from? I’m in Alberta truck loving, oil rich people lmao 
9996 2018-03-17 15:55:22 getting my oil changed and the dude who served me at the desk had a teardrop tattoo if i dont tweet after this y’all know why
9997 2018-03-17 15:55:22 This would be tricky for teachers. Are there facts pertaining to "Why are we still at war?" Or is it all just shades of political spin? I think I know. CIA/Oil/Profit!

10001 2018-03-17 15:55:00 Always remember to read your product labels. Products with "Mineral oil & Petroleum" Are a BIG NO-NO!!! #naturalhairjourney #Getcomfywithit #loveyourkinksandcurls #natualhairjourney #kinkychicks #kinky_chicks1 #naturalhair #teamnatural #naturallycurly #naturalhaircommunity
10002 2018-03-17 15:54:51 Yes it was pretty poor timing for me which is why I went into the oil field because I had five kids and wanted to make sure they are fed. Looking back on it we probably would’ve been OK but I’m happy to be home now. I loved my time there but my family is here.
10003 2018-03-17 15:54:42 Finessed my father into going to get my oil changed 
10004 2018-03-17 15:54:39 hahahah mahilig sa baby oil

10006 2018-03-17 15:54:35 Yes because it doesn't happen every single season this time of the year around the league...or much earlier if we are talking about the Maple Leafs #Lupul
10007 2018-03-17 15:54:34 i’m high asf and at an oil tasting store
10008 2018-03-17 15:54:22 Dads are supposed to be better than you (more experience) and teach you, I would suggest start small and do basic maintenance on your vehicle until you feel fine with it, stuff like rotate tires, swap out air filters, change oil and filter, change bulbs, check your battery, etc.
10009 2018-03-17 15:54:15 Well Elliot you will see rUK oil revenues dropping to almost zero when we do leave the UK  Do some real homework on GERS which is almost total guesswork with little real Scotland figures. Plenty of discussion on that issue over the years.
10010 2018-03-17 15:54:09 Sweden is becoming a 7th century shithole. Norway had the sense to use their oil as a savings account. We squandered ours! Finland has the highest suicide rates in the world. 
Now stop being silly and bring Brian Cox to heel.
10011 2018-03-17 15:54:08 These fbi cronnies were colluding with Hillary Clinton who was colluding with the Russians as part of that crooked uranium deal..u know ! Every mineral or gas and oil that's on federal lands are the property of all Americans..and that's a fact!
10012 2018-03-17 15:53:52 (Ik kijk 't *verbaasd* aan. Eerst Rutte, EU, "vergezicht". Nu "linkse" v/d Burg offeren. En dan nog "tovenaarsleerling" en "snake oil")

10014 2018-03-17 15:53:36 Since the US dollar is tied to oil sales in the Middle East (oil must be bought in US dollars)...
10015 2018-03-17 15:53:26 That's my point. They are able to achieve a certain level of "equality" beacuse of acess to these unique conditions (created by/c of political will & history) & natural resources (sheer luck of birth/geography.) But the debate is whether it's sustainable or an oil house of cards.
10016 2018-03-17 15:53:20 Old pipelines are the only ones leaking anywhere,  unless they were damaged by equipment. Leaking pipelines are the fault of enviros who won't let them be replaced. Pipelines are safer & cleaner than moving oil by truck or train
10017 2018-03-17 15:53:03 We do not much maint. I think we seasoned them last a few years ago. Cook, scrub (yes, with soap), dry, maybe toss a small layer of oil on before putting away.
10018 2018-03-17 15:52:55 Cutting down the rain forests planting palm trees to use for cheap palm oil in our foods is Wrong  Several Large companies are doing this for profit  It's bad for us the animals and environment  Burning trees that store toxins for us released into the atmosphere causing harm
10019 2018-03-17 15:52:50 Eh, I'll eat both, but I try to avoid the canned stuff with mayo. Olive oil and either capers or pickles... that's where it's at.
10020 2018-03-17 15:52:37 I just want an oil change... that’s it dawg 
10021 2018-03-17 15:52:35 According to some RAND researchers, it is normal that the teen is still asleep as we approach noon. What doesn’t seem fair is that I’m still sleep deprived what with all the mindful nurturing on my plate. And coconut oil.
10022 2018-03-17 15:51:38 I just mixed Ice Water and Que Oil in the same cup. Happy St. Fratty’s
10023 2018-03-17 15:51:34 100% and if that discussion took place and the player doesn't recognize the benefit, there is a communication issue between the two sides.
10024 2018-03-17 15:51:29 Who has Sunday tickets to Amalie Motor Oil NHRA Gatornationals?
10025 2018-03-17 15:51:26 England is built on coal...But of course that resource is a fossil fuel and fading...just like oil....  And England and Wales are building renewables..Dogger Bank field alone will exceed all present SCottish onshore AND offshore wind capacity..without wrecking the countryside
10026 2018-03-17 15:51:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
10027 2018-03-17 15:51:23 Yeah. I prefer chilli oil.

10031 2018-03-17 15:50:45 I accidentally made this once when i used coconut oil instead of butter.

I don't eat mash either way so this did not offend my palate.
10032 2018-03-17 15:50:45 oil change ?????
10033 2018-03-17 15:50:23 A country that has been the largest producer of oil well before I read those history books yet it's people continue to dwindle in abject poverty! #RescueNigeria classic example of Man eat Man Society!
10034 2018-03-17 15:50:14 After blaming my son for not having heating oil, an hour later he had asked me if I spoken with a lawyer. I got to move out first. So, I told him, "Honest to God, no."
10035 2018-03-17 15:50:09 He will continue doing this that’s all he cares about money and big oil companies
