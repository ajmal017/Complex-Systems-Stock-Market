45 2018-01-10 22:30:17 Human attention is the most powerful asset. It's the attention that makes or breaks technologies, products, and commodities.
46 2018-01-10 22:25:39 Topic that takes too long to talk about. The costs just trickle down to the consumer. Pricing carbon is another tax which all of these commodities are already heavily taxed but use a different name. Think another tax magically solves it all? Why didn’t the other taxes then?
47 2018-01-10 22:23:50 Do you know what’s unfair? The children of a Baltimore school wearing winter gear during instruction time. Children are our magic gold dust, precious priceless commodities and one of a kind diamonds in the rough. Who is ACCOUNTABLE, who?
48 2018-01-10 22:16:08 Yes - they are in the driver seat. Most are already SOEs so probably not worthwhile to pull a SNB. The world will soon begin to realize that China is the price setter for commodities (hint: petro-yuan coming soon) thus rendering the $USD and its massive deficits obsolete.

55 2018-01-10 22:07:47 USDCAD....while NAFTA may be ONE of the factors in BoC's decision not to raise rates, more importantly, what is 100% certain is the fact that economic growth is accelerating + commodities outperforming + seeing wage pressure and growth. Trade the knowns - not what IFs

60 2018-01-10 21:56:59 Labors worth, like all commodities, is relative and not easily fixed. Particularly when you have an enormously large cohort of people who have no interest in working.

64 2018-01-10 21:41:40 Oh, don't we all know that. The point of the comment is that any institution requires funding, and the execution and implementation of a new plan would require additional resources, both human and commodities which means additional funding is necessary.

105 2018-01-10 18:41:24 Audio recap: Inflation is coming Audio recap of today's trading
The return of
inflation is going to be a big conversation in 2018 given the broader macro
implications and overall risk to financial markets. Commodities prices are back
on the rise and could already be stirring…
106 2018-01-10 18:41:15 Nothing New The GOP has been using Humans as Commodities to make Billions in Profits for Healthcare Industry especially the Pharmaceutical Companies. Truth to Americans we DO NOT have the best Healthcare in the  not even close. Been to Emergency Room lately Wait time 8-12 hrs
107 2018-01-10 18:41:00 Neither of those points makes it a scam though, which was the point I was trying to make. Any new currency is largely based on the value of pre-existing currencies, because people already agree what one US cent or Euro means in terms of real world services and commodities.
108 2018-01-10 18:40:41 Why bother with specific commodities when you can overpay for virtually every fungible thing from barley to raw water -- with ContangoCoin©™® ? 

Remember: ContangoCoin©™® because smart contracts via crypto make this super doable. (And if we CAN do it, we SHOULD.)
109 2018-01-10 18:38:07 Does this mean that the prices of other commodities which are not basic can be increased wantonly ?
110 2018-01-10 18:22:12 Do you think a corollary of that would be targeting cryptos and projects that have already survived 4 plus years? Longevity and experience are scarce commodities in crypto. These projects have at least shown a dedicated team and have been attempting to evolve, offer value.

122 2018-01-10 17:32:51 CAT didn't buy BUCY in "07 or 08"...  it closed in mid 2011.... which was the peak of a number of commodities.

123 2018-01-10 17:30:57 Hector.
What commodities? And what's the location of the warehouses?
124 2018-01-10 17:21:59 Education is not for sale, but certificates are, and to sell such a commodity in a competitive market where quality is not a requirement for buyers, then marketing commodities is just part of doing business.
Simple formula
125 2018-01-10 17:19:39 If it is commodities, u can think about it as an online purchased item, which is there in some godown. Even if the market collapses u will have an item. 

Tax on profit or tax on purchase and sale ??
126 2018-01-10 17:05:45 Ah... referring to January 7, 1980, when the exchange rules regarding leverage were changed, as COMEX adopted "Silver Rule 7" placing heavy restrictions on the purchase of commodities on margin. The price dropped over 50% in just four days, causing panic in the markets.
127 2018-01-10 17:00:52 I’m so ready to get into the agriculture side of commodities go with my other JB plays..oh and I doubled up on SCHW when you were so enthusiastic the other day on HR..Thanks JB..I love following you and hope to actually pay you lol

144 2018-01-10 16:06:04 The latest #EIA data show US crude oil stockpiles falling again- pushing Brent crude prices that much closer to the US$70/barrel mark.  Interestingly, rising US crude production hasn't put much downward pressure on #oil prices of late.
145 2018-01-10 16:03:52 Argos tbh. Maplin are absolutely awful for commodities
146 2018-01-10 16:02:00 That a huge difference between the API and EIA data of over 6 million barrels! The drop in production (-290K bpd) is likely caused by the New-years,, so not really indicative.

251 2018-01-10 09:35:24 The real issues are those kids to whom we are unable to give protected future and present, those graduate who are roaming on road with degree seeking for jobs, the inflation due to which commodities have become untouchable to middle class.

266 2018-01-10 08:07:14 What is Trading?
  In Trading, the goal is to make a profit through frequent buying and selling of stocks, commodities, or digital currencies, selling at a higher price than the one you purchased. It is, therefore, a short-term investment.
