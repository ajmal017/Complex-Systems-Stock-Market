1 2018-12-09 23:59:34 You tagged satoshilite lmao
2 2018-12-09 23:59:18 Maybe you are having a psychotic episode. magic internet money was in your head. You are not a crypto millionaire. You work a McDonalds
3 2018-12-09 23:58:46 Yeah
4 2018-12-09 23:58:37 En éste programa, y en ésta cadena en general, parece que nunca han visto lo que es la objetividad. Manipulan todos los datos y dan la información a medias para decir lo que quieren. Por suerte, la gente no es tonta y se da cuenta de las cosas, dais verguenza #ObjetivoAndalucía
5 2018-12-09 23:58:35 Source?
6 2018-12-09 23:58:30 おはよ
7 2018-12-09 23:58:26 How do you know we have hit bottom?

$Crypto twitter is fun again!
8 2018-12-09 23:58:19 22!
9 2018-12-09 23:58:19 We can also grant wishes
10 2018-12-09 23:58:12 I remember so many of my friends bought crypto coins during the bubble. I thought, this is an obvious bubble and these coins have no actual intrinsic purpose right now so I won’t invest.... I won.
11 2018-12-09 23:58:05 Honored to be apart of this great list! Only person missing from here is @Bleeding_Crypto , he's awesome!
12 2018-12-09 23:57:54 Except the person making the argument is not the crypto investor. He just agrees with it. As do many people in the replies who are not crypto investors.
13 2018-12-09 23:57:49 My short was at $5840 
14 2018-12-09 23:57:47 That ratio is outrageous.
15 2018-12-09 23:57:47 Relax, friend. We just have dissimilar beliefs in a crypto. They are an anonymous currency and a risk, yes. I just so happen to enjoy them. Also, jack cheddar is an exquisite strain mixed with a dash of head doctor. 
16 2018-12-09 23:57:46 @Crypto_Core @CryptoMessiah @Crypto_Bitlord I think someone should chart % of new follows per month of OG accounts. I think that would be one hell oh an indicator!
17 2018-12-09 23:57:21 Low key shill like a boss
18 2018-12-09 23:56:49 Lets rewrite this headline: "@coinbase abandons its cautious approach with plan to list up to 30 new cryptocurrencies" | Should read - Coinbase cannibalizes #bitcoin and the crypto landscape as they blatantly grab for millions in large fees for listing scams. FTFY
19 2018-12-07 23:59:43 What a jerk! He reminds me of that other jerk I read about, Stalin
20 2018-12-07 23:59:43 POC of 2019 is going to be 6k. 

All of crypto Twitter just became nauseated.
21 2018-12-07 23:59:42 Thank you to all Crypto firms that keep working and believe in a better world despite the 11 months crashing in price , keep up the good work #lsk #strat #dcr #waves #xrp and many more
22 2018-12-07 23:59:34 Just to be clear ... I got ICT concepts into #crypto since 2014. His work is great and works well in alot of markets. The guy tho ... well, you will find out soon enough.
23 2018-12-07 23:59:07 Oh I do remember! And one day we will have our own « crypto summer dream » 
A road trip around the world (thank god we both love driving) to expand our knowledge and teach about ALL cryptocurrencies. @satoshigirls

24 2018-12-07 23:58:39 That's a mastering of Photoshop right there
25 2018-12-07 23:58:30 It’s like therapy to me. I work on wicked problems all day long, with complex nuances, different perspectives and values, and heaps of uncertainty. It’s challenging and exhausting.

Crypto is one of the only things in my life that is truly, purely stupid.
26 2018-12-07 23:58:13 Sometimes I am afraid you are playing us all with these beautiful charts, knowing no one will check what you are saying and thus confirming some of your sheep theories (people blindly following and believing what they want to hear)  - crypto got me suspicious
27 2018-12-07 23:58:07 Do t be sore....but more!  
28 2018-12-07 23:57:57 That’s a bit less than I thought... 
29 2018-12-07 23:57:56 Timing is everything with a good joke
30 2018-12-07 23:57:52 You’re behind! Do try to keep up.
31 2018-12-07 23:57:46 No worries. Sensitive times in crypto lol
32 2018-12-07 23:57:44 Just bought my way back into the #crypto #market. Nobody can time the market so I get back to #investment rule number one: #BUY THE FEAR - #SELL THE GREED.  

$BTC $ETH
33 2018-12-07 23:57:40 As bear market continues, a lot of Blockchain projects will run out of cash, and not like equity, they can’t raise again. ICO is a one time dose. 

This is good for the market in long-term as good project with good risk management will survive.

#blockchain #crypto
34 2018-12-07 23:57:29 By the way, good man for making a pearl necklace joke.
35 2018-12-07 23:57:20 You still run one of my favorite projects in crypto.
36 2018-12-07 23:57:14 Any Crypto would be at risk of that in places where it’s needed most. I don’t see Governments hostile to it b/c it is neutral, meaning no other Nation State owns it. If they did ban it how to enforce? Go around and harass the businesses who accept? That may make it go viral.
37 2018-12-08 23:59:40 #tron is about to bounce and make a bull run support at 0.0124 #buy #buybuybuy #crypto #Binance
38 2018-12-08 23:59:20 Then we'll have to use crypto for peer-to-peer cash or something...
39 2018-12-08 23:59:10 Sounds like a good idea. I don’t jniw what the average CTer looks like. How was Vegas? Full of hot investor nerds??
40 2018-12-08 23:58:44 @crypto_douglas 
Hi Kirk,
Thanks to you, I was called Spartacus in school. I was very young and I think it felt quite cool.
Thanks 
41 2018-12-08 23:58:32 Do you have insight into the remaining ~96.5% of ETH supply? Why do people find it so hard to understand that the only real difference is *visibility* of ETH held by ICOs versus ETH held by everybody else, including the *new* ETH rewarded to miners at a cost for that matter?
42 2018-12-08 23:57:57 2018 in retrospect: almost rekt my whole account 20+ times, decided to focus on entrepreneurship with no plan b fulltime January, got rekt multiple times in Crypto, a lot of all nighters, and trying to find my path. Gaining a bit of traction as a result. Pt 1.
43 2018-12-08 23:57:42 めちゃくちゃ下がったところで買えばいいじゃんっていう人には、BTCインバースチャートの去年の今頃を見せたい
44 2018-12-08 23:57:12 またこのパターンか
45 2018-12-08 23:56:55 I feel a lot more comfortable about your guys vision for crypto now. Nice job on massaging the emotions. Trust is everything. Let's see how you do in picking coins to add to your platform. That will really 'sell' the story.
46 2018-12-08 23:56:15 If you take away secure crytpto then only the bad guys will have secure crypto. Wait a second..
47 2018-12-08 23:56:03 Coins be down - 99% and now consensus is that they are overvalued :/
48 2018-12-08 23:55:59 @ModernInvest one of the very few crypto YouTubers I take seriously! Keep up the good work TMI, your hard work is very much appreciated 
49 2018-12-08 23:55:58 信玄さんでる！見学行きたい！
