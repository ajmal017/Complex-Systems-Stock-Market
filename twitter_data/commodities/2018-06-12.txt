41 2018-06-12 21:47:01 Historically the model for value has been on things held by persons and/or entities

Data as commodity has produced pricing models ie insurance, advertising, etc

However the value (trillions) is aggregated/traded by 3rd parties

Simply, persons 21stC value is commodities based

43 2018-06-12 21:41:45 Supply management IS eminently defensible when it involves ensuring security of supplies in essential commodities like dairy and poultry for a small economy like Canada's beside the boom-bust and heavily-subsidized and private-corporate-sector dairy and poultry industries in USA.
44 2018-06-12 21:39:39 This could be awesome for other commodities on the forex. It sets a precedent for lawsuits against silver manipulators.
45 2018-06-12 21:08:11 Sorry for the layoffs. Trump & his cronies own the problem just as they will own all the job losses in steel, aluminum & other commodities regardless of whether it is US imposed or a retaliatory tariff. I am also sorry for home builders eating US tarrifs on softwood

Also, what is bad with socialism? Scandinavia seems great.
54 2018-06-12 20:27:11 I sucks that I have to tell ya this, bub, but the laws of the Constitution are there to enable us to provide housing, education, and all other commodities (health care is a commodity) for OURSELVES and are specifically designed to eliminate the need of gov't dependence.
55 2018-06-12 20:25:31 Trump's actions at G7 make it clear that he's either going thru w/ pulling out of Paris Pact & implementing import tariffs on commodities that negatively affect US mfg, tech & Ag sectors.

66 2018-06-12 19:46:03 I think the best way he the president Buhari should bring the high cost of essential commodities down is to change his economic policies and stop being a hard liner on good people of this great country Nigeria. Killings in Benue should and must stop.
67 2018-06-12 19:35:11 One mentioned the idea of low energy, high volume medical refrigerators co-located in telephone mast sites.

120 2018-06-12 15:57:38 Great post! It's remarkable how much Western companies in a few selected industries (FMCG, fashion) dominate the list. Is there really no Asian company with a great supply chain? No online retailer? No commodities business?

122 2018-06-12 15:42:52 In other words he will blame the Clinton camp for their collusion with Kim and for not getting trade tariffs down to less than 1% for all commodities.

141 2018-06-12 14:17:29 I travel extensively in the US, it's not confined to borders - Price controls that subsidize production at the expense of consumers result in misallocation of investment and retard innovation - just as punitively taxing commodities like gasoline.

217 2018-06-12 06:09:28 They back off of the profits to allow states to jack up the Taxes and now they jack up the profits in commodities again so that everyone gets screwed at the pump BUT the States & Profiteers get rich at our expense. Now that’s what you call collusion!
218 2018-06-12 06:00:31 Obviously they keep these circumstances private due to future opportunities that may involve trade. It is now a global market and to prevent commodities from fluctuating privacy is of utmost precedence.

226 2018-06-12 04:52:46 This "idols are commodities" is so sad but in the sense of practicality, you wont get anywhere if you are not properly marketed. You won't reach a wider market if you aren't exposed. But still, it's sad.
227 2018-06-12 04:30:17 Centre's attitude towards Delhi govt has been outrageous.

Non-cooperation by bureaucrats is selfish, illegal and destructive. 

But Kejriwal's offer to support BJP for statehood is amoral. This man thinks ideology, principles & people's trust are trading commodities.
228 2018-06-12 04:29:33 So are 
Afghanistan.
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Diamonds & Other High Value Commodities.
Dual Use Goods.
Eritrea.
Guinea Bissau.
Haiti.
Iran.
Lebanon
Lyberia 
Kenya

To prescribe the reason wholly to the man keeping glorious communism down is wholly disingenuous.
229 2018-06-12 04:21:33 Is Trump signalling higher tariffs on Indian steel & other commodities ?? @CNBCTV18Live @ZeeBusiness @ETNOWlive ?
230 2018-06-12 04:20:10 Most of the players are Canadians; you know, exports, commodities, if you will, who will be subjected to a 25 percent tariff by the Canadian government, July 1.
231 2018-06-12 04:12:46 of course, the people they hate also grow their food, extract their fuel, mine their commodities, and protect their borders...

which they only seem to realize after they start shit they can't finish.
232 2018-06-12 04:11:53 #BudgetKE2018 they're amending the tax laws to increase tax on essential commodities. Lord save us
233 2018-06-12 03:54:14 I love how these people can deny facts that are openly available on actual government, corporation information and international commodities trade websites.
234 2018-06-12 03:54:10 Supply vs demand dictates the market. The Gov. can subsidize segments of the industry (short or long term) to off set #trade #commodities. Not the best scenario but it happens in every country.
235 2018-06-12 03:50:33 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
236 2018-06-12 03:20:34 Yo sé q con lo sgte, estaré hablando sola (me da lo mismo): ante esto de q  le ganó a  en producción de litio, QUÉ estamos ESPERANDO pa hacer de Chile un destino TURÍSTICO por excelencia como fuente de ingresos?! Basta ya de apoyarse en los volátiles commodities 
237 2018-06-12 03:06:26 Yeah… we are so often treated as commodities and so rarely as full-fledged persons.
238 2018-06-12 02:57:14 I'm vegan bc I don't think living beings are commodities.
239 2018-06-12 02:50:18 The argument would be, you tax the shit out some commodities from the US, why would it bother you if the US decides to tax some commodities from Canada? The eyebrow thing just makes me wonder WTF made him think that would be a good idea?
240 2018-06-12 02:47:02 Why? Don't be attached to an asset. Make money from both the rise and fall just like stocks, commodities, forex. BTC is nothing special in my eyes.
241 2018-06-12 02:34:16 Making the things worst than worse are the blind Liberal supporters who say : price rise in other commodities has nothing to do with gasoline price-hike.
242 2018-06-12 02:22:46 #Commodities
#Oil trades 0.2% higher after rising 0.5% overnight
#metals closed mixed, LME Index declined second day in a row
#Aluminum and #Lead closed positive
#Copper, #Zinc, #Nickel and #Tin closed negative
#Gold steady above $1300/oz
243 2018-06-12 02:14:22 The pound tanked & the price of gold went up a lot. Which is interesting when you look at the fact that Nigel Farage was a commodities broker in metals in the past.
244 2018-06-12 02:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
245 2018-06-12 02:00:21 Yes, but what do I know. Just looks like the S&P, Silver, EUR, Wheat, Cotton, multiple assets, vulnerable to a smackdown here. 25bp, possibly 50bp, but I give the latter low odds, just a risk. If wrong, all good for PMs, commodities, stocks. If right, even better, cheaper to buy!
246 2018-06-12 01:57:50 All I can say is that the S&P is primed for a pullback here, as are other assets like Silver and the EUR. I believe they could be surprisingly hawkish on Wed. If I'm wrong, great, if right, even better, just creates a cheaper buying opp for PMs, commodities, and stocks imho.
247 2018-06-12 01:51:25 Trump foi bem na condução das negociações com a Coreia do Norte até aqui, um grande feito. 
mas isso não apaga seus erros na política de taxação a algumas commodities E na política em relação ao Oriente Medio

Trump tem seus erros e seus acertos. 
#TrumpKimSummit
248 2018-06-12 01:41:50 As Livermore said, "the only thing one needs to when trading commodities is Supply/Demand...
249 2018-06-12 01:38:34 So what are the tariffs that are too high? Why doesn't trump just say he wants them lower? I actually don't know which commodities are are tariffed other than milk and eggs but that's bc our milk and eggs are more tightly regulated, so ours are more expensive but also safer. .
250 2018-06-12 01:24:22 ED pfee - no job
ED pfee - no money to pay rent 
ED pfee- no money to buy basic commodities
ED pfee- no medicine in hospitals 
ED pfee - urikurara parukukwe can not afford a bed. 
ED pfee - you wiping your bottom with a newspaper if not tree leaves 
ED pfee - can not afford  shif
251 2018-06-12 01:17:31 Investiu bastante porque estava se locupletando nas commodities... num cenário não criado por ele. Puramente conjuntural
252 2018-06-12 01:11:47 You can, but what I was referring to is automobile mfgs set a price for their cars. We don't do that and you can lose your ass in commodities. No thanks.
253 2018-06-12 01:08:03 He's important in understanding key features of the free market model. How surplus value works in Mills and why Marx applies a dialectic to his commodities (use values and exchange values).
254 2018-06-12 01:07:57 Nah education isn't a necessary prerequisite for labor. Lots of things are commodified under capitalism that otherwise aren't really commodities, education included. As far as socialist education, my party, FRSO, has plenty of resources on their website. PSL also has good stuff
255 2018-06-12 01:07:45 I'm just curious but how does it look when we factor in services. Just goods seems a bit shortsighted since we assuredly send a decent amount of service type commodities to our neighbors to the north and south.
256 2018-06-12 00:40:04 Kd o Mantega? Ah, claro, aquele idiota que insistiu nos commodities em plena crise econômica só enfraqueceu a nossa Economia que é pobre industrialmente e não tem royalties de quase porra nenhuma inventada aqui. Merece prêmio? Nem do PT, pelo visto.
257 2018-06-12 00:15:50 He did more than just vote, he did exactly what Clinton did to get Gramm-Leach-Billy and the Commodities Futures modernization act passed, he lobbied hard for the bill. He then proceeded to appoint Tim Geithner to Treasury Secretary.
258 2018-06-12 00:15:41 Uber every year lost billions of dollars and 'coins'  are not businesses, they are not supposed to make money just like curencies or commodities. But if they are used wider they gain value.
259 2018-06-12 00:06:21 How was he supposed to change the world when he appoints Larry Summers the biggest advocate for Gramm-Leach-Billy and the Commodities Futures modernization act,  and Robert Kagan the biggest advocate for the invasion of Iraq?
