4 2018-11-21 23:57:33 This Evan Spiegel guy got that 600 million dollar (in cash, not stocks) Snap IPO bonus last year when they went public and instantly stopped giving any fucks about Snap's success as a publicly traded company, the guy basically said I got my money, fuck the rest of y'all 
5 2018-11-21 23:57:24 I agree.  I was just trying to be a bit sarcastic.  Heard the other day how private prison stocks shot to the moon when Trump was elected.
6 2018-11-21 23:57:19 Is there any chance these tariffs are a way to beat the market down so Trump and his cronies can load up on stocks, end the tariffs, and ride the big bounce? His corruption is at this type of level. #DonTheCon
7 2018-11-21 23:56:39 Not every stocks went down is really bad. We have lot of great stocks are down. The only problem is NOT if but when to get in again.

12 2018-11-21 23:53:54 You mean the almost 3 month BEAR market? Riding it out - except I sold ALL of my chip stocks. It sucks bigtime. Trump sucks bigtime. Nothing else to do. *Bought more $FB!

40 2018-11-21 23:46:13 503 stocks were up 4% or more today, that's a decent amount. It was all about the $IWM
41 2018-11-21 23:45:26 Couldn’t agree more  

Yes I’ve been saying that over and over. All of my progressive dividend stocks have also been the best performing stocks and what’s more important is that’s gonna continue rather than stagnation from high yielding stocks.
42 2018-11-21 23:44:57 And check H&S in Dow Jones.
If it breaks. We can get stocks at much lower levels for next one year, at least!
43 2018-11-21 23:42:48 I spy Chef brown sauce! Yess! I just had to buy a case of 9 from Amazon to get some as it's one item that not a single shop here stocks. A rasher or spuds just not the same without it!
44 2018-11-21 23:40:49 I agree.. my point is that people have beliefs based on stuff that was said 30 years ago, that may or may not be correct. I certainly don’t agree in averaging down in stocks, but some people do it successfully and I don’t think it’s wrong.
45 2018-11-21 23:40:06 Nah man trying to poke someone derping in a shields dumb lol im trying to end stocks after 120
46 2018-11-21 23:40:01 @paulkrugman hey paul, is there a chance the recent stock markey downturn is a message of dissatisfaction about the 2,018 election sent by the wealthiest 5%?  after all, don't they own most of the stocks?

49 2018-11-21 23:38:35 What does Bitcoin and EA stocks have in common? 

Steep Downward slopes.
50 2018-11-21 23:35:52 Relaxing bank regs, ignoring school shootings,using land from national parks for drilling for oil,etc. The economy where stocks and investments,and retirement plans r tied to the stock market.Stocks losing all gains.Maybe I’m the only one bothered. Could be.
51 2018-11-21 23:35:40 Ruck Stocks & maybe tall defender…..Do not want to see Boyd or Schache in the ruck unless absolutley necessary. Need the talls working on their forward craft….
52 2018-11-21 23:35:30 @jimcramer I could give you a long list of stocks you've advised people watching your show to Buy. Over last 30-60days ago. No one expects you to be some super star. But don't act like you know it all. trying to use nice words/adjective. Don't be so damn egotistical and God like!
53 2018-11-21 23:35:25 You must be Kernen’s brother.  Seriously?  The guy rambles doesn’t add anything to market discussion.  He can’t talk stocks.  He can’t get into fundamentals. Are you frickin’ serious???
54 2018-11-21 23:35:01 There's a distinction that should be made, imo.  Averaging down in individual stocks typically ends in compounding your losses, and potential chaos to the account.  Averaging down into index funds if your time horizon is 15 yrs+ out has worked over time.
55 2018-11-21 23:34:47 Thank you for saying, "I don't see."  Because you don't, because you don't look.  There have been plenty of attempts to bring mental health care up, to reduce unnecessary items like bump stocks, and to introduce anger management ideas into schools. These are from both sides.
56 2018-11-21 23:34:47 Wag the dog! Because the Tech stocks... Nice.
57 2018-11-21 23:34:18 @AliVelshi talked about the stocks on @msnbc yesterday but u r right every station should be talking about it
58 2018-11-21 23:33:53 These companies are not diverse enough, that's the real issue.  Once their transphobia is stamped out the stocks will rise once more.
59 2018-11-21 23:33:24 You got put in the "stocks"? 
60 2018-11-21 23:32:02 You know when oil was higher it was stick bumps. Now that stocks are down, it is cheap gas. Pick a random measure, something is always in the good. Shit-shining as shineola.
61 2018-11-21 23:31:10 Stocks in Asia look set for a reprieve from the recent sell-off after a modest rebound in technology and energy shares underpinned gains in U.S. equities 
62 2018-11-21 23:31:06 To clarify, I never traded crypto but I banged out all the crypto stocks hard last year lol.
63 2018-11-21 23:29:52 Gold miners showing surprising strength. Probably people just trying to anticipate the flood of money into gold when "the market crashes." Dont like gold stocks along with 99% of people out there.. But I can't argue with $BTO $ABX charts
64 2018-11-21 23:29:24 Hot new weed stocks
65 2018-11-21 23:28:47 Soooooo I have my money in a stock app. I know what stocks to buy I just don’t know how many shares to buy.
66 2018-11-21 23:28:46 Can't wait for the day when I don't have to immediately sell my free stocks and can actually let it flourish
67 2018-11-21 23:28:36 @jimcramer,Seriously you need be real, not just now but for years. Lately you've told people to buy certain stocks not considering the end results of what the market,Feds and our great Machines which are pre program. You can blame the Feds but look in the mirror. be real not ego!

73 2018-11-21 23:21:30 Lawsuit should be filed. Need to find a willing lawyer. Gov. is negligent in their role of protecting wild stocks.
74 2018-11-21 23:20:08 Iceland have ample cheese football stocks
75 2018-11-21 23:19:06 Appreciate all the info you share about cannabis stocks here and the overall industry in your daily email. What do you think about the $BCO deal with $CGC? Any teeth in that for $BCO?
76 2018-11-21 23:18:58 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can't buy what is popular and do well.

85 2018-11-21 23:11:38 What’s so bad? Economy is booming, jobs are growing, unemployment is dropping. Stocks are up, gas prices are low, and you’re still free to speak your mind. Life is good here, if you don’t live in fear.
86 2018-11-21 23:11:28 hahahehe- god it doesnt matter what stocks anyway
everything has been beaten to death !
87 2018-11-21 23:10:55 My favorite thing to hear or read in markets reports is a hysterical phrase like “hitting the lowest level since March” or “the biggest decline since July” or “leaving stocks slightly down for the year.” Capital Shrug.

90 2018-11-21 23:09:45 @jimcramer excellent discussion and emphasis on suitability! It’s a huge part of the series 7 exam and something everyone needs to think about before pulling the trigger on purchasing stocks!
91 2018-11-21 23:08:53 MSCI Asean fell -0.3% to 749.14.

PXP: Philippine Energy Stocks Falls on vague/unclear South China Sea pact.

SMC Airport Concession Approved By DOTr.
92 2018-11-21 23:08:37 It’s like playing Lucario in crews and starting 2 stocks up
93 2018-11-21 23:07:19 Look at latest BAML fund manager survey. They said they’d buy 10 yr at 3.7 - the number has been drifting higher as stocks float..

When stocks are green, as they have been, there is opportunity cost.

Sympathetic to fiscal crowding out argument, but we’ll see. I like duration...
94 2018-11-21 23:05:59 Penny stocks are share of real companies and a lot of it, desappear after a couple of years. No more companies = noore penny stock. Saying 95% obviously is just a number without any sense, but there are a lot of coins out there without any working product. Nothing is forever

96 2018-11-21 23:03:16 Dear Sean, yesterday I explained the different between a tampon with or without an applicator to a shop assistant.  @lidl_ireland in Macroom only stocks tampons with applicators because, presumably the person doing the ordering, is unaware of the difference.  WHY????

98 2018-11-21 23:02:33 Go ask a weekly guy at Kern County or Lacrosse or Evergreen if they "reskin their cars every winter" Those are certainly the types of tracks where the new body having an aero advantage would kill you. Kern's gear rule in their Super Stocks makes it even harder to find speed.
99 2018-11-21 23:01:42 #TRANSLATION: We are deep into a short position on stocks and Forex. Now would be the perfect time to wipe billions off the ledgers.
100 2018-11-21 23:01:07 Follow up to the Federal wing selling off GM stocks at bargain basement prices.  If elected expect this to happen sometime around 2023, right before the election call.
101 2018-11-21 23:00:53 Why should they have to - when UK has its own fishing grounds rich in fish stocks but dictated to by EU quotas?  whilst French andSpanish waters have been overfished and their stocks depleted by them taking fish that are too small. You can see them on sale in the markets!
102 2018-11-21 23:00:50 Sell off some of their stocks and shares. Downgrade to a cheaper to run sports car.
103 2018-11-21 23:00:45 Baltimore has a middling Pension by Northeastern U.S. standards. Pension service was extended from 20 yrs to 25 years. Contribute 10% of salary to plan - retire at 25 yrs 60% of salary- no minimum age. City contributes and guarantees plan. Plan invests in stocks and bonds
104 2018-11-21 22:58:59 Lol. This is what you spend your time doing. Keep my Twitter stocks up. Thank you  
105 2018-11-21 22:58:43 I use Personal Capital but it's not amazing for short term planning. More like state of  your stocks/flows, and retirement planning.

107 2018-11-21 22:55:59 Sadly, these people cater to a group that lacks any sort of proper education, so they'll stay where they are.
On a positive note - they're the laughing stocks of people worldwide.
108 2018-11-21 22:55:01 Knew the lettuce bubble would eventually burst. Glad I shorted all my romaine stocks. Good money to be made in produce
109 2018-11-21 22:54:43 This is why I love junior miners and other small stocks that are buyout targets for bigger companies. The buyout announcement at a premium is the obvious sell signal. It takes the hardest part of a trading decision and makes it easy. Perfect setup when it works.
110 2018-11-21 22:53:26 you mean manipulation like in stocks and gold?  If you can trade it, you can  manipulate it.
We have a few examples in "normal" market everyday, such us oil

114 2018-11-21 22:51:18 The illogical angst for above average PE multiples once again exposed. CYBG $CYB shares almost halved since August (3 months ago!). Was this ever trading on High PE?

115 2018-11-21 22:51:09 Course they do, they get that sweet EU subsidiary cash. The fisheries dont get shit, just a slap in the face and told they cant go to sea bc the rest of the EU is busy plundering our fish stocks
116 2018-11-21 22:51:08 Nope, those are the facts! You must watch Fox “news” And Obama almost ruined us? You mean how he got us out of the worst recession in decades? The 75 consecutive months of job growth? Cut # of uninsured in half? Maybe the 47% growth in stocks his first year that began the rebound
117 2018-11-21 22:49:41 LOL.  When the markets are down all these people start to mention 95% of coins will die and this and that.

I dunno if you are aware of the fact in normal stocks there are also penny stocks and there will always be penny stocks. 

This market makes people act like they are smart.
118 2018-11-21 22:49:31 Stocks are down too

122 2018-11-21 22:46:42 Has Indiana put into place a red flag law or ban pump stocks, does Indiana have local police chief of cities in town determine who gets and who doesn't get a permit to carry a gun the way Massachusetts dose.
123 2018-11-21 22:45:48 Lettuce Stocks yes..
124 2018-11-21 22:45:28 Yes. I noticed that with a certain wry amusement a few days ago. To think that the authorities are worried that the sell-side might actually be bearish!
All stocks are equal, but some are more equal than others.

125 2018-11-21 22:45:24 I mostly do stocks so I don’t have to watch my charts! I have 3 jobs so I don’t really have the time for forex right now like all of my free time I want to spend with beanie 
126 2018-11-21 22:45:23 Becks Blue quite good.  But again hardly anyone stocks it.
127 2018-11-21 22:45:01 So a guy who’s made tons of money and lost tons making smart and bad guesses, made a really smart decision in the middle of a major downturn, by selling stocks facing headwinds. Or maybe it’s cuz he runs the world. You’re a dope.
128 2018-11-21 22:44:47 Ah, shit, I thought you meant like stocks and bonds, not the actually lettuce lol. My bad.
129 2018-11-21 22:44:37 @AskFrontier Yeah, I got a question. Why the fuck do you call it “fast rural internet” when I can’t even hit 1 Mb/s? Fucking dumbasses, no wonder your stocks dropped.
130 2018-11-21 22:43:36 According to CNN stocks went down. Many important companies affected. Was Donald Trump right?
131 2018-11-21 22:43:03 lemme just check my stocks before we go to the olive garden
132 2018-11-21 22:43:02 The rationale is that it's not needed. Stocks are basically a liquid asset that you can buy and sell with the click of a button. Real estate is not liquid, it takes way longer to realize a profit from it.
133 2018-11-21 22:41:50 I have ~10,000 shares of $INSG.  I’m trying to determine if it’s worth holding all of them, or diluting a portion to $MIXT or something similar.  

I believe the 5G stocks are the ship to be on right now.
134 2018-11-21 22:41:39 Stocks are also referred to as “shares”, stocks represent a unit of ownership in the issuing company. Investors can earn a return by selling shares for a higher price than acquired as well as in the form of dividends if applicable. #HomeTalksMoney #FinancialLiteracyMonth
135 2018-11-21 22:41:30 Macquarie: 2019 is promising to be an even more uncertain and eventful year than 2018. Discord between monetary and fiscal policies reigns supreme everywhere #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
136 2018-11-21 22:40:40 The number of stocks listed on the NY Stock Exchange is down 40% since the 1960''s. What does that tell you? All the money is being listed and spent in China and in the Far East.
137 2018-11-21 22:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
138 2018-11-21 22:39:48 And if I am a working person and have my 401k in stocks that lose money because you cancel these loans, what do I do?
139 2018-11-21 22:39:33 feels like a stealth rally coming in metals stocks indeed
140 2018-11-21 22:39:02 Agree Hunter. Growth was still accelerating back in January. Now it is decelerating. Big difference. Zero reason to be long stocks right now unless it’s based on hope that growth starts to accelerate again and fast.
141 2018-11-21 22:39:00 $65 Billion off crypto market. 

$1 Trillion of FANG stocks.
142 2018-11-21 22:37:51 Investors seek stability as they bail out of tech stocks
143 2018-11-21 22:37:40 No one capitalizes stocks go \ america gets weak.
144 2018-11-21 22:37:36 Everybody weighing in on an oversold Bitcoin bear market while stocks are going to sale off 40 to 50%. Anything near 4K is a bottom for $BTC imo
145 2018-11-21 22:37:30 Stupid question on bigger name stocks like nflx etc I don’t need borrows right?
146 2018-11-21 22:37:22 Just hope this rally continues.  I gave up on all parp stocks and I question this one's momentum.

149 2018-11-21 22:35:42 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed flat giving up early gains with US market closed Thursday Nov22 for Thanksgiving.
150 2018-11-21 22:35:42 Key difference here @AlexSaundersAU is that those FAANG stocks will likely recover. 90% +/- 5% of crypto won’t

158 2018-11-21 22:33:22 @JDhelpteam Hi! I wanna buy Nike Air Force 1'07 LV8 Utility Low, but now it is out of stock. I wonder if you will replenish stocks later?
159 2018-11-21 22:31:58 One of the biggest challenge of today crypto market is that the current investor base is also over exposed to FANG and to a lesser extent to cannabis stocks. This can be seen in the increasing correlation between Nasdaq and Bitcoin.
160 2018-11-21 22:31:28 if i am going to concern myself with saudi arabia, i would start by looking at their acquisition of tech stocks including their growing interest and involvement in US biotech and genetics

we should look closely at the so-called moonshots and the agenda of ppl behind them
161 2018-11-21 22:30:25 Currently looking for the trade... stocks and bonds and shit too
162 2018-11-21 22:30:20 accumulate high float mature stocks, then dump covered calls on bulls. (thats what buffy is doing with his $aapl holdings--that's his thing,
163 2018-11-21 22:29:48 Perhaps the greatest indicator of how much a company truly cares about its employees is the quality of the toilet paper it stocks in the restrooms.

165 2018-11-21 22:28:47 i wouldLike to buy stocks in this ....
166 2018-11-21 22:28:47 Why #Stocks are going down?

Because investors are selling off.

But why are investors are selling off?

Because the stocks are going down @StockCats
167 2018-11-21 22:28:31 Did you ever think you'd see the day that cash accounts would again be competitive with stocks? It's happening.

Vanguard Prime Money Market fund has earned 1.68% YTD.

Vanguard 500 Index stock fund has earned +0.7%, incl dividends.
168 2018-11-21 22:27:43 TBH - I didn’t think Cindy needed to be ask such a blatantly rhetorical question. Those that thought they were ‘acting in the public interest should be keel-hauled, doused in salt and put in stocks for public ridicule. There was no need for her to explain anything at all.
169 2018-11-21 22:27:31 Yeah...And the fact that the store only stocks about 5 of them anyway, and you are in line behind about 200 or so people! I can spend the same amount of time in DMV and actually have a better experience!
170 2018-11-21 22:26:42 Exactly. That’s what you would think or those who bought these stocks as bond proxies are moving into gov bonds.
171 2018-11-21 22:26:36 i do not feel upside momentum. a different feeling than i have had in quite awhile. the undercut and rallies that have worked well for the indices and individual stocks for many moons seems to have trouble. is the market telling us something?
172 2018-11-21 22:26:22 True. Housing market is looking very bad. Stocks may bounce, but trend will be down mid to long term for foreseeable future.
173 2018-11-21 22:25:43 $IQ $TCEHY $GDS $ATVI & $UA were my 5 TOP performing #stocks today.
174 2018-11-21 22:25:11 22/11/18: Dow was green all day but closed flat. Confirmation is needed whether this is double btm or will continue to slide. On back of $MIN & Albemarle deal, we may start to see interest flocking back to lithium stocks $CXO, $SYA, $LPD, $ASN
175 2018-11-21 22:24:59 Stocks crashing on the screen makes it even more miserable.
176 2018-11-21 22:24:39 I voted Yes because I wanted to live in a land that was funded by dwindling fossil fuel stocks, misery causing booze and where the concept of money was irrelevant. If only more people thought like me.
177 2018-11-21 22:24:26 My professor said there’s some cheap stocks where you can invest like 10 bucks. Fuck I forgot bro I would tell you

187 2018-11-21 22:16:40 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
188 2018-11-21 22:16:02 You would have to be absolutely bonkers to have a position in stocks or bonds. Extremely risky business. This is the best time to buy #Bitcoin.
189 2018-11-21 22:15:55 A few more weeks and stocks will fall hard because of sanctions, unemployment rate will rise because of sanctions, taxes on middle class will rise because of sanctions, and all of you trump lovers will get no tax refunds just like the rest of us.
190 2018-11-21 22:15:34 Access to fish stocks off our Coast is declining more as each season goes by. Women have minimal presence as primary harvesters now. By the time future generations are of age, the remaining stocks will have been traded to  other countries for other product market access. Brutal!
191 2018-11-21 22:15:10 RT @ArlanFF101: #Ethanol stocks fell to 22.8 million barrels in the week ending November 16, down from 23.5 million the previous week, but up from 21.9 million the previous year. #oatt

You gotta anticipate the dip
194 2018-11-21 22:12:55 Stocks edge higher on Wall Street after 2 days of big losses
195 2018-11-21 22:12:24 New products usually push these OTC stocks.
196 2018-11-21 22:10:17 The stocks went down and are continuing their downward spiral. Wall Street likes the Republicans and the job the President is doing, @POTUS has been threatened by idiots in the democrat House, thus the fear on Wall Street he will be too busy answering questions about nothing!

Every day in the past 6 months RIGHT UP TO ALL-TIME HIGHS, you TV traders were pushing stocks, hi-flying Techs, over-priced industrials..BUT NOW UR CONCERNED?
199 2018-11-21 22:08:29 For an acre of forest at least 50-to-500 huge trash bags. Buy more Hefty Bag stock along with them Rake Stocks. Get rich quick.
200 2018-11-21 22:08:19 In response to a number of responses to my tweets no one claimed that the market had bottomed , simply that there were a number of stocks that were extreme value right now . We all know that bearish sentiment will persist whilst markets struggle.
201 2018-11-21 22:07:14 If I wanted to chart a ratio between the metal and the stocks, would you use URA or something else like the fund you mentioned earlier.

203 2018-11-21 22:06:31 Hey @marcorubio here is a Bible verse for the unjust, also regardless of whether one is RICH or poor. Something else in common.
Acts 16:24 
 Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
204 2018-11-21 22:06:04 taxes...about 50%...donate 10% to my Church....  about $3million in Treasury Bills...nice income flow from that.... and buy some stocks that have been beat down recently...
205 2018-11-21 22:05:29 I would say yes, and my actions support it. This has nothing to do with our life savings, unless you were all-in with petro stocks. Move your investments. Be a decent person. Find the morality in you
206 2018-11-21 22:05:00 All this data is great but what is the conclusion? Stocks are pricing in too much 5G upside?
207 2018-11-21 22:04:02 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-11-21, is 318.88. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
208 2018-11-21 22:03:53 Stocks really be life changing. It’s beyond me why more people don’t trade. These last 1k+ days got me feeling right. 
209 2018-11-21 22:03:50 Skittish about tariffs? Well, don’t worry, Trump kinda knows what he’s doing...it’s helping our deficit already. But you guys don’t give any credit to that...& if stocks react to bozo dem antics after January... you’ll have a confirmation. Trump is doing everything @GOP wanted.
210 2018-11-21 22:03:24 Stocks some spirits, eats some ribs.

213 2018-11-21 22:01:55 The concerted action highlights a broad deterioration in sentiment as stocks have erased about $3 trillion in value from the September peak, sending the S&P 500 toward one of its worst years since the bull market began in 2009.

Ethanol stocks declined as well.  Markets are closed tomorrow, but open in a shortened session on Friday.
224 2018-11-21 21:57:02 And you believe that the Founding Fathers know there would be AR-15's with Bump Stocks that could kill hundreds of innocent people very efficiently and quickly, as opposed to muskets that could shoot one shot per 30 seconds.
225 2018-11-21 21:56:53 EZ shares +1.2%, US shares +0.3% (but couldn't hold highs and driven by tech stocks so nothing to indicate here we have seen the bottom).

$A 0.7264 with $US index -0.1%.
226 2018-11-21 21:55:37 I'm thinking, time to sell stocks, SERIOUSLY! Remember it was 7000 when #Obama took over?
227 2018-11-21 21:54:49 So is it CoreCivic or GEO stocks that you own? How do you benefit from the government contracts these private prison companies are receiving? First Step=Continued Prison Slavery!
228 2018-11-21 21:54:28 Don't know who that is, sorry. I don't see stocks; I see sales
229 2018-11-21 21:54:01 Easy pickens after 2 days of heavy losses. Those stocks were bargains at the market open, so it only made sense to see a small rise in averages today
230 2018-11-21 21:53:38 CNN on day when stocks are up: Thank you, Obama!
CNN on day when stocks are down: Drumpf is ruining the economy! Overturn the 2016 election and install Hillary now!
231 2018-11-21 21:52:32 I would hope not. He might be saving for a house or in stocks.
232 2018-11-21 21:52:11 I took profit on my stocks. Just sitting on the side lines now. Retirement port just chilling on the side letting ny life make those decisions
233 2018-11-21 21:52:02 But this proves the opposite of your point...yes stoneman douglas had security & police who were early on the scene..but it did not make much difference. Security is good but ending bump stocks and availability to assault weapons, & hiring the age to obtain a weapon is good too!
234 2018-11-21 21:51:57 I may use “fundamental value” for stocks or even real state or anything that generates cash flow.  But I don’t like “intrinsic value” because is an anchoring to objective theory of value, which I fully reject.
235 2018-11-21 21:51:02 U.S. stocks closes higher on Wednesday 11/21/2018. $DJIA -0.00% (-0.95) at 24,464.69, $SPX +0.30% (+8.04) at 2,649.93, $COMPQ +0.92% (+63.4) at 6,972.25.
236 2018-11-21 21:50:58 Never mind. everything good DT wants to claim credit when it's still good. Like the stock market ups and downs. Thought stocks investors are all smart people but can they see him through?  Just wonder.

246 2018-11-21 21:43:26 I heard FAANG stocks lost $1 trillion…I bet a few of those folks owned bitcoin. Even a small fraction of those stock owners choosing to cover losses with bitcoin profits (or simply derisking) could move bitcoin price quite a bit.
247 2018-11-21 21:43:10 send link to details. Stocks have lost 40% over last 5 months btw. Maybe it's reflecting that

259 2018-11-21 21:34:04 People always ask me what I want for a gift, whether it's my birthday or Christmas. There should be an easy way for someone to just buy you a share of a random stock. Get on it @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood ! #stocks #StockMarket #dividends #investing
260 2018-11-21 21:34:03 Retail investors either panic selling and out for good, or convinced we are going to 1k and selling anyway.

It does sound like loss but the value of share will be less.Stocks and bonds are basically gamble game so no matter what it's risk

301 2018-11-21 21:11:32 Fairly quiet markets today as Europe and NY stocks remained calm ahead of the long weekend. We saw USD retrace some of the gains from Tuesday with commodity currencies the biggest winners as Oil stabilised. EUR swung around 1.1400 for most of the day due to large expiries.
302 2018-11-21 21:11:13 World stocks generally higher: Europe +1.1%; US +.3%. Bargain hunters swept into US stocks early but rally faded a bit at end of day. Still, a very bad week for US market. Turnaround should be in full swing next week as investors reassess market realities of solid earnings & GDP.
303 2018-11-21 21:10:48 Stocks end mostly higher despite late selloff. Dow -1 to 24,464 after trading as high as 24,669.

But S&P +0.3%, Nasdaq +0.9%.
Russell 2000 small-stock index leads, +1.4%.

Winners top losers by nearly 3-1 on NYSE, Nasdaq 

Enjoy your turkey, sage grouse, or however you celebrate

308 2018-11-21 21:09:20 So much for that #stocks rebound. The S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, but a 200-point rally on the Dow vanished & it closed at session lows. Nasdaq gained nearly 1% but still down 3%+ on the week.

351 2018-11-21 20:48:12 You need only one portfolio for bond investing now: the Vanguard Total World Bond ETF.  A good place to be as stocks continue to crash, gold remains stable, the real estate glut worsens, and oil drops.

395 2018-11-21 20:26:46 Also people storing value in BTC makes global markets more efficient. Stocks/real estate will be valued not by the amount of people parking their savings in them, but by the actual valuation of the stock/real estate it's self

402 2018-11-21 20:21:13 QE (Quantitative Easing) is not free. When money supppy is expanded then Treasury Bonds are devalued. So one increases interest rates to maintain equilibrium. Higher interest rates lead to reduced borrowing, shift from investment in stocks (active) to bonds (passive). Cooling.
403 2018-11-21 20:20:59 Haha the gop is still in the house the stocks have been tanking before midterms. Once again the gop ruins the economy.

405 2018-11-21 20:19:44 So unlike what you said above - stocks recovered in part because of CFP and despite discards being part of the CFP process - I can agree with that

413 2018-11-21 20:17:12 The best shorts are always value stocks that become distressed. Without exaggeration low P/E shorts tend to be really profitable with relatively little risk as the cycle turns.

423 2018-11-21 20:10:33 On the subject of sliding stocks: did our usual year-end loss harvesting a couple of weeks ago and we're sitting on about 10 months' worth of cash now. So if worst comes to worst we'll be able to ride a good bit of it out. Don't time the markets, but do time your cash flow.
424 2018-11-21 20:10:30 For what it's worth, it's only restricted to publicly traded stocks. I think the theory is that a market of public stocks is socially useful but is harmed by insider trading. But public companies face large regulatory and disclosure burdens that wouldn't work for private assets.
425 2018-11-21 20:10:09 Aside from the feds raising interest rates, who is to blame for the market woes? Tech stocks..Apple and Facebook are is a free fall. Can't blame @POTUS for that, though I am sure YOU will.

435 2018-11-21 20:05:21 My guess is she doesn’t know anything about the economy. Trumpers use that talking point all the time, but when asked what *exactly* the economy has done 4 them personally, they don’t have an answer. Raise? Tax break? Stocks soaring? They are regurgitation words w/o any knowledge
436 2018-11-21 20:04:43 yes... however these are the tech companies losing ground! Facebook, twitter,Amazon, google... these stocks are over valued anyways... these are the companies that will get split up for corruption and fraud

444 2018-11-21 20:02:35 Good argument that stocks are recovering despite the CFP and not because of it,given what I highlighted I see that scenario as a disasterous management measure,difficult to think of anything more wasteful apart of course from continuing that same disasterous policy for years

449 2018-11-21 19:59:50 Lower oil --> higher corp earnings (Lower transport expenses) + more retail disposable income --> will reduce cost push inflation --> does not imply lower wages (unless macro recession) --> if higher stocks -- >> tighter Fed.
450 2018-11-21 19:58:08 Thanks for this slide, Becky. Dr. Liau has been concerned with surrogate markers for a while now. This summary from a Smith on Stocks post is from her talk almost exactly two years ago, 12/15/16, at the Seattle Science Foundation:

452 2018-11-21 19:57:53 It was around $33 in 2008. Seeing a connection here? Nothing like a Republican caused recession to lower oil prices. Real estate slowing, stocks running out of buyback tax cut money and more tariffs. Great recession 2.0

456 2018-11-21 19:55:30 I might be crazy but I think they want him to war with the saudis bc  they want the oil prices to skyrocket, they want stocks to plummet, so they can blame Trump. They hate that the economy is going well. They couldn't give 2 sh!ts about a Turkish journalist. Just my opinion.

462 2018-11-21 19:51:20 If there's a bond bubble collapse stocks and will see their prices rise as money seeks haven in real assets.

489 2018-11-21 19:39:00 Gas prices are low for the same reason stocks are tanking

Your tariffs and massive deficits coupled with global instability created by you is pushing the economy off a cliff. Drops in energy costs are a leading indicator of slackening demand
490 2018-11-21 19:38:42 what exactly are you keeping an eye on? do you think these stocks are getting (or could get) more interesting due to the recent "bumblast" or that the bumblasting could continue due to the illiquidity (weakness begets more weakness)?

512 2018-11-21 19:27:40 Joking about how my little brother who is 19, invests in stocks, and contributes monthly to his retirement account is going to have to take care of me financially for the rest of my bank-account-zero-life was all fun and games until my dad called him my ¨sugar-brother¨.
513 2018-11-21 19:27:18 Is light a particle or a wave?  It's both.  Stocks are the same...the chart and the fundamentals are just two different forms of the same thing.
514 2018-11-21 19:27:15 prices will be aviable all day on black friday ( or till stocks last depending on item) this is for the prizes for the giveaway!
515 2018-11-21 19:27:11 If it draws attention to the problem through flawed understanding of the methodology, then so be it. 

We've collectively ignored the results of letting kids, young kids, try a form of gambling as volatile as trading stocks. 

BACTA have bought political silence for too long.
516 2018-11-21 19:26:58 There is much "news" out there. Recession, Politics, Strife, The Wall, Scandals.  A month from now, when looking at the charts, you won't know what the news was. Moral? Just study the charts.  The "News" is in the charts.  #stocks

518 2018-11-21 19:26:38 yup, many stocks at technical lows, some all time lows and although they can stay low for sometime, securing stocks in this market should provide profits later, having available funds that can be left to ride it out is key plus a mentality that allows you to do it.

533 2018-11-21 19:20:52 I think the bigger risk with big tech is the MSFT/INTC situation of the 00's. Earnings continued to grow but multiples contracted as the stocks flatlined. It's hard to say GOOGL isnt a good value here but if it takes 10 years...that's a career.

Thanks for bringing on Mark Mahaney from RBC; IMO he's got the best insight to the FANG stocks.
543 2018-11-21 19:15:19 Confused. Didn't you start out trading stocks?
544 2018-11-21 19:14:51 Stocks plummet, wiping out all gains for the year. My IRA lost thousands in value last month. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
545 2018-11-21 19:14:48 Yeah. It's much better for those it matters to to frame it in terms of poor Derek and his son from Cornwall being beaten down by regulation, when the real story is very rich people wanting to deplete stocks to get richer.
546 2018-11-21 19:14:36 Microsoft (MSFT), meanwhile, was one of the top stocks in the Dow Jones, up around 2.5%.
547 2018-11-21 19:14:05 Except stocks are tied to revenue generating companies, which “digital assets” are not. 

XRP has utility in fintech & should be categorized as such. Any digi-coin with not function and no ability to generate revenue is what I like to refer to as speculative diarrhea.

556 2018-11-21 19:10:26 Then we need to rethink it. Everything is fake., fake money fake teachers fake stocks. Only one thing is real which is Gold. Gold is in the world before the humans, same like a God is this world before human. So Gold is God’a money rest is veryrhing is fake

562 2018-11-21 19:08:03 But at the end of the day these stocks generate profits. How many crypto companies generate profits from their tokens? And how much voting power does a token holder of these companies have?

The answer to both is zero.

565 2018-11-21 19:05:09 There's still a "SELL ON STRENGTH" that's plaguing this market right now. Sell the rip is still driving theme. 

Once we see start seeing stocks able to hold on to their gains and build on those gains on a more consistent basis, that's when we'll know that we're bottoming

572 2018-11-21 19:03:41 I'm hoping we have enough positive momentum re-established by then.  If we are at $12K and trending positively we could be a welcome escape from stocks.  If a recession came this month we would be screwed.
573 2018-11-21 19:03:03 Hi, thanks for getting in touch. The demand for the Hue outdoor products have exceeded expectations, we are hoping to have stocks replenished soon. We do not have a specific date for this, however keep an eye on our social media channels and website for updates.
574 2018-11-21 19:02:57 Regardless, I added to my crypto positions here... seeing a long value proposition.

I do share your stock sentiments however, and have been doing well betting against indexes like IWM and QQQ along with individual stocks.

579 2018-11-21 19:01:16 I highly doubt investors would put their money in an even riskier asset class than stocks if the market crashes. But gold is not moving as much as I expected lately either. So where is money flowing to nowadays?
580 2018-11-21 19:00:38 Risk sentiment improved overnight, news catalysts absent. The S&P500 is up 1.0%, led by tech stocks. Brent crude oil is up 3% as supply fears take a rest. US bond yields rose slightly, as did risk-sensitive currencies.
581 2018-11-21 19:00:32 Retail stocks are not the hottest commodities right now. Despite growing comparable sales, both $TGT and $KSS tumbled after earnings. A by-product of this is that both companies offer oversized dividend yields. ~ Jing Pan, Income Investors

637 2018-11-21 18:31:00 When are stocks of the over-65 vaccine going to be available in Hampshire?  The pharmacy at my local supermarket have been waiting, & so has my GP surgery.
638 2018-11-21 18:30:24 I see your point but dont you agree there is still a huge difference between bringing a gun or admitting you own stocks or smoke a joint? I mean, it's not a weapon. Anyway, 16% of canadians have smoked and may get denied entry. Too bad for America . Tourists $$$
639 2018-11-21 18:30:11 MJ stocks gaining more ground now. Holiday season of MJ? Gold, oil, crypto all choking
640 2018-11-21 18:29:33 I think we should be more accurate with how we represent this argument. Blackrock/Vanguard are merely indexing stocks, it's the buyers of those funds that are the issue. We should present alternative index funds like $ESGV and $VSGX as smart index investments w/o #fossilfuels.
641 2018-11-21 18:29:17 Stocks jogava na mesma equipe que o Caio. Será que pode rolar algo?
642 2018-11-21 18:28:26 Hey, if you had $1,000 to just throw away, even rebounding to $.10 would net you $99,000. That's the lure of severely devalued currencies and penny stocks. Small moves could net big wins. But probably not.
643 2018-11-21 18:27:32 At midday, Mortgage Bonds unchanged. Stocks holding gains. 10-yr yield 3.07%.
644 2018-11-21 18:26:47 I have a feeling that stocks would crash if all the news outlets reported on every Shark attack simultaneously.
645 2018-11-21 18:26:14 As soon as I'm done paying off my student debt and this car loan, I'm putting 50% of my paycheck into stocks, maxing out my 401K / Roth IRA, and savings.

We have to shop somewhere & it will be your competition, who are increasing stocks! Get rid of pizza occupying many freezers instead of the small vegan one!

652 2018-11-21 18:23:21 When many analysts predicted further fall,I suggested accumulating quality stocks.
Now Nifty & Small cap index trades at 6% gains in a period of 4 weeks.
653 2018-11-21 18:23:08 Bitcoin is still up 500% in the last 2 years. What stocks are up 500% in the last 2 years? That's right. #tryagain
654 2018-11-21 18:22:56 $HEDG has been around a long time focused on shorting stocks for not cheap 1.5% fee. Short tech and consumer discretionary stocks. Good record in last two months but long term record is horrible. Been time it right. @EricBalchunas
655 2018-11-21 18:21:22 Nice win Jeevan!
656 2018-11-21 18:21:07 Or invested in cannabis stocks...
657 2018-11-21 18:20:54 Again, Google “media embargo.”

When news comes out in medical journals, reporters frequently prepare stories beforehand. It’s an old system, and people who invest in biotech stocks should know about it.
658 2018-11-21 18:20:43 I’ve got a safe & cabinet full of semi auto rifles that can’t be converted & will take down any game in the world. We need to do something & starting with the AR style rifles makes the most sense. Ban bump stocks, high cap. mags & close gun show loop holes as well as backgrounds!
659 2018-11-21 18:20:21 Another idea. For every acre that's torn from the dwindling reservations of Native Americans they should be given a billion dollars from the people snatching away their land and culture. Big business wants to make a stake? That reservation deserves 50% of your company stocks
660 2018-11-21 18:20:20 Another red day, sounds familiar? 

Only two blue stocks AFM, great results this morning and MCL slightly higher.  Nine reds. Seems my sale of ITX was timely as it’s fallen another 17% 

Tomorrow should be a little better

662 2018-11-21 18:20:07 Yes. And f&g had to close the previously open winter season  below sH1 bridge to preserve fish stocks after years of decline .
663 2018-11-21 18:19:41 12x or next year’s earnings. Does it matter which one is wrong? Same story for countless stocks and the fallacy of using analyst estimates.
664 2018-11-21 18:19:38 @cnbc @wsj The market is in correction territory - some stocks are down 30-50%. But market analysts and technicians are not happy with any rebounds until they get their capitulation.  With no bids to catch falling stocks the declines continues. Self-fulfilling prophecies.

666 2018-11-21 18:18:28 It’s dumb, but here goes:

St. Peter says, what did you do?

St. P: no, what did you do for *others*?
B: ohhh. I gave a bum a dollar once.
St. P: uh, is that it?

667 2018-11-21 18:18:06 I give two  what large, corporate investors do with their money. For the little people, get out now, buy back when stocks tank (bc they will) and pick low risk investments. The tide will hopefully turn in 2020.
668 2018-11-21 18:17:23 Wondering how many in the Trumpsphere have shorted oil stocks this year.
669 2018-11-21 18:16:39 Want to wish all my friends on twtr a very Healthy and Happy thanksgiving to you and yours!! Stocks and money are one thing, but health and family trumps all. Be well!
670 2018-11-21 18:16:30 Last week's video covered another example.... 1994 was a tough year for both stocks and bonds (confusion/consolidation/harder market).  1995-2000 was a great period for stocks (easier market).   Have a fantastic Thanksgiving!  Chris and Kathy
671 2018-11-21 18:15:16 @hjta. With all the California Legislatuon underway, do you know how heavily invested the State pension system is invested in the utility stocks that may go bankrupt. Hope you guys will ramp up your efforts to protect the taxpayers that don’t have a public pension on the line.
672 2018-11-21 18:15:14 I don’t understand the hodling part of all this anyway... I mean I sort of understand people want to wait and sell high for profit... but aren’t coins supposed to be used for purchasing things instead of using fiat. I guess cryptocurrencies are treated more like stocks.

675 2018-11-21 18:14:35 Spot on - for 5 years! Which brings us to my original tweet saying they can get away with that style only for so long...There's the first time for everything...Regardless of whether the reason stocks going down is solely down to awful displays, it can't be good if it goes on...
676 2018-11-21 18:13:48 #crudeoil dropped 8% a day in a very "orderly" manner.  Also the drop in tech 2 days ago was 8% "orderly" in most stocks..let's call it an orderly slaughterhouse..
677 2018-11-21 18:13:05 I don't care what people say about him and Amazon.  It's the biggest brilliant landmark of the century.  Amzing how we even have to adjust our whole economy around Amzn! $15/hr.. Yes please.Benefits/Stocks.AAP $8.50/hr? hmmm
678 2018-11-21 18:13:03 @StockNewsGazette Indeed, but that has happened to a lot of stocks, and sentiment rarely drops below 70-80%.
679 2018-11-21 18:12:35 a large number of stocks are in the bear market....no bueno
680 2018-11-21 18:11:45 The other argument is that the 2000-2013 bear never ended and we are still in it. That would mean stocks would need to fall to retest the 2007 and 2013 highs. Could it happen? Sure. That would make this bear market, at 18 years, the second longest ever. Longest was 26 yrs.

689 2018-11-21 18:07:41 Considering moving my daytrading to stocks so I can trade both directions (also higher liquidity). Am I correct no crypto shorting exchanges permit US traders? Not interested in bypassing w/ VPN: (1) account could be closed w/o warning (2) tax reporting. Thoughts or feedback?
690 2018-11-21 18:07:26 esp when both stocks are prolly buys
691 2018-11-21 18:06:34 It is exactly what happened in 2015.    Bloomberg ran article at end of 2015 "The year nothing worked".   2016 was a great year.... it is a sign of confusion/consolidation..... Most likely big moves coming in some assets in next 12-24 months (see stocks 2016-2017).
692 2018-11-21 18:06:29 We haven't even tested 5.8k as a resistance yet. A long grind has just started. I do believe, one can make a fortune in these ranges as well. I say all this with a view that we'll bottom out like commodities do instead of deep v pattern like stocks. I can be wrong though.
693 2018-11-21 18:05:53 Is that book worth buying if one already has a more recent edition of  Stocks for the Long Run?

695 2018-11-21 18:03:26 Now I just need to learn to identify stocks before they break  out like ANY for example.  would have been great to get it or recognize the breakout before it happened.
696 2018-11-21 18:03:16 For oil and stocks there is green on the screen but red is far from dead
697 2018-11-21 18:02:44 New home purchases tumbled in September to the weakest pace since December 2016. Sales of previously owned homes dropped for a sixth straight month, the worst streak since 2014. Homebuilding stocks have lost more than a third of their value this year.   #WednesdayWisdom

701 2018-11-21 18:02:08 Hmm.. No comment.

All I can say is that Pharma stocks are down today in a rather risk-on rallying market.  
So, they both are right about the drug prices.
702 2018-11-21 18:01:48 What does this have to do with Scott Walker relaying his thoughts of F-16s and freedom? Absolutely NOTHING. You are an arse. Obama is not the topic of discussion. Grow UP and focus on the now or are you going to blame Obama for stocks tanking yesterday & your toe nail fungus too?

707 2018-11-21 17:59:05 Most likely Option #18: this company is partnering with multiple big players and creating something never seen before that will hybridize stocks and crypto ont one trusted exchange. 15billion in gold brings more parties to the table. #phoneboythinksmall
708 2018-11-21 17:58:24 Thats Normal and Nobody is surprised.
NIKE stocks got down coz of Kaepernick case and same happened to TESLA with Musk-SEC case and there are many examples. After that both stocks get stable before the DOWS correction. I think this can be a good Ad for Nissan against corruption.
709 2018-11-21 17:58:23 Is that so. Let me know how that works out. Seems like tech stocks are still down bigly. And China's GDP is through the roof. I said no wins in a trade war. I guess I was wrong. Just us , just us.

720 2018-11-21 17:54:59 My swing trade process for those interested:

741 2018-11-21 17:47:55 Makes perfect sense for stockholders; stocks soared when:
•PG&E: CA bailed them out from responsibility in the fires they caused.
•Logging Co. when #45 proposed logging as solution to wildfires.
•Private prison when CA pays $75k/year per inmate but pays $1/hr as firefighters.

779 2018-11-21 17:27:05 It looks like many Stocks did good work today (eg #ETO Hammer) but even if we bounce a bit we may not get far. I think lot more Chopping around etc will be needed before Market finally calms down. Sideways Range on FTSE100 has held.
780 2018-11-21 17:26:52 I completely agree on bump stocks. Don't think anyone's "for" bump stocks other than the manufacturer. I think the issue is how to define accessory devices to outlaw.

I need to understand what breaks down in background checks...does the law change or is it implementation?
781 2018-11-21 17:26:44 the market is the most ugliest i have seen since 2011, if i am not wrong. and the sad part is it is still grossly overbot. fad stocks like $twtr $fb etc are being held up by big boys even at these prices.
782 2018-11-21 17:24:57 Amazon employees doing “insider gentrification” ahead of the HQ announcement got me thinking.

Nov.20 (Dow Jones) -- By most measures the U.S. economy is in excellent health. Yet stocks are sinking, yields on corporate bonds are rising and commodity prices are tumbling—all typical precursors of a slowdown or recession.

792 2018-11-21 17:21:54 If a trend follower holding stocks or ETF’s for months/years at a time goes to cash every time the market takes a dip, he’s selling low, which only leads to buying high. This is the opposite of how to make money in the long run.
793 2018-11-21 17:20:13 Agree 100%.  It's just smart, especially in these market conditions to narrow your focus onto a few (select) stocks.
794 2018-11-21 17:19:36 This is extremly poorly written article. 1.) Cryto is a new asset class. As such it could be used as store of value when in a bull market. Last 9 years that were stocks. And it is much more handy as gold or bonds.2.) It better than money because there is no inflation.

810 2018-11-21 17:15:40 Today's Lessons.  
1) Don't trade 2 stocks simultaneously
2) Don't ever miss a stop loss on a trade
3) Cut losses, even when it's -$2k, better than -$16k
4) Be patient at the open. 
5) Trade <2k shares, not >3k  (0.10 loss = -$300)
811 2018-11-21 17:15:14 That’s what we’re hoping for. Great holiday retail sales, an agreement with China, duct tape on Powell’s mouth & people to invest Christmas bonuses in stocks. Oh darn & then I woke up.

817 2018-11-21 17:12:00 A mistake to buy the DIP. It's early profit taking & dumping of overvalued stocks by big boys. They're cashing in & you'll be trapped, the bigger sell off is on the way.

818 2018-11-21 17:11:55 Bump stocks? How about fixing the current background check process? How about using the same rules for background checks and scrutiny across borders (i.e. federalize)? Only unimaginative people assume ‘gun sense’ laws or fixes have to apply to just guns.

866 2018-11-21 16:54:07 It is widely accepted among emerging market investors that this year’s sell-off in EM assets was a product of dollar strength: the rising US currency, in conjunction with rising US interest rates and tighter lending conditions, sucked money out of EM currencies, bonds and stocks.

885 2018-11-21 16:45:49 Agreed! I try not to buy anything much over 15 forward P/E as a general rule. Most stocks just aren't very close to that. Still need another 10-15% drop for $ABBV, $PEP and other potential buys.

909 2018-11-21 16:35:30 At one point it was over $2. If you bought $1,000 worth now, and it ever rebounded to even $1, that would be a cool million. But that ain't going to happen anytime soon. Its like penny stocks. If you can risk a small loss, the returns can be incredible. But probably not.

993 2018-11-21 16:07:56 I guess that means people think there is a lot of upside in tech stocks. However, It could just mean theres a lot of downside to be had everywhere else.

1000 2018-11-21 16:06:04 I was thinking the same as the market was falling yesterday. Might not be a bad idea to start buying little pieces w/ the expectation of future buys but most stocks still aren’t providing a good enough risk/reward. High valuation tech stocks could still fall a lot more.

1054 2018-11-21 15:44:12 When I refer to liquidity, I am focusing on global net liquidity. The fact that both stocks and bonds fell is not surprising, suggests a bigger macro issue with US assets, which you've been alluding to, and I agree with. Foreign liquidity disappearing for both.

1114 2018-11-21 15:30:39 Seems to be a good day but I am never confident with Chinese stocks until the trade war is over . I bought at 13,05$ $BILI and yesterday $BZUN at 30,2$ and add some more today at 35$. This last one going from 45$ to 30$ in 2 weeks was no sense. Also in port. $AMRN $FNKO

1116 2018-11-21 15:28:49 So from tomorrow start buying stocks that sell chilli powders! @DelhiPolice authorises carrying chilli powder in pockets just like that!
1117 2018-11-21 15:28:41 2 green trades today I’m pumped #stocks #stockmarket 
1118 2018-11-21 15:28:27 Without the tariffs their profit last year would’ve also been higher than the previous two years. I am informed. Just because profit is down doesn’t mean they aren’t sellin just as much. When the tariffs end their stocks will reflect their sells again rather than tariffs.
1119 2018-11-21 15:28:15 How’s her 401k doing? How about stocks and bonds? Not newsworthy, I cannot believe some editor or producer didn’t flag this, oh, might require some ethics
1120 2018-11-21 15:27:39 The Chief Operating Officer or COO, in a business corporation or company, is the one that would be held most responsible and accountable as he or she manages the day-to-day operations of it, orders the hiring or dismissal of any employee, signs its certificates of stocks and
1121 2018-11-21 15:27:37 Ako din puro biggie nung college/adult life but nung natikman ko to ayun di na ako dumaan sa Wendy's  Yay thank you  Sana meron na nyan that time.. nag-ask na ako ng stocks hahaha 
1122 2018-11-21 15:27:33 Glad I sold my stocks before the plunge
1123 2018-11-21 15:26:59 1. oil prices are dropping bc of a supply gut
2. lower oil prices can continue to be a reason for a decline in the stock market. As oil prices drop, money managers will liquidate stocks to pay for Commodity Margin Calls @jimcramer
1124 2018-11-21 15:26:43 Everyone make sure to talk to your family about Weed stocks at Thanksgiving so we can have another Bitcoin like move into Christmas.
1125 2018-11-21 15:26:36 Hi Frank. I'm afraid none of these stores stock the Beyond Burgers which could be why my colleagues there don't know about them. The closest store to you that stocks them would be the Colney Hatch Extra. Hope this helps - Cameron
1126 2018-11-21 15:25:59 Well hopefully they don't sell out and go to WWE to become laughing stocks, or not get the push they deserve because of the creativity they possess
1127 2018-11-21 15:25:56 I admire anyone who has the nerve to trade stocks for a living.  And, there are many ways to skin the cat.. my way is just the way I know, and I'm an expert at it.  But one thing is universal. If you don't respect risk, you WILL go bust. It's just a matter of time.
1128 2018-11-21 15:25:48 I wonder: how I should do at this stage: I have a list of stocks for shorting, but the situation is embarrassing, because many stocks have already slumped significantly (NVDA, ALGN, GE, NLFX, etc). The risk reward ratio is not good for the trades too, but the downtrend is certain
1129 2018-11-21 15:25:12 Wouldn’t touch it. Terrible chart, expectations reset. Wait for substantial new orders. Valuation more reasonable given cash but asymmetric reasons to wait til real business improves. And stocks like these get destroyed in a down markets, so my guess is better entry.
1130 2018-11-21 15:24:00 He sure is. I predict a recession in 2019. Wish I had sold all of my stocks, not just half.
1131 2018-11-21 15:23:58 Apple stocks.
1132 2018-11-21 15:23:53 13/ Revenue is down. Stocks are a multiple of revenue. Insiders have sold on the bumps after stock buybacks were announced leaving remaining shareholders holding the bag as stock prices continue to slide.

Decreasing stock prices indicate the US is in a bear market.
1133 2018-11-21 15:23:43 @tadashboi 3 stocks und am Ende hab ich noch 3 Stocks

1136 2018-11-21 15:22:55 Did you like the Dow this morning? It has fallen so much is a depression getting ready to happen? You lost what you thought you had. People want to sell out stocks with a crazy President like you. Stop talking.
1137 2018-11-21 15:22:44 For someone who shorts stocks, no one is going to consider your bashing so called “advice”. Just dip, no need to cry about losing money every 5 minutes lol.

75% of Americans do not own stocks, and don't give a shit.
All that matters is the paycheck.
Week to week..
1141 2018-11-21 15:22:01 Today's only narrative to buy stocks is an expectation of Fed lowering interest rates - whatever happened to the story of trillion-dollar companies $AMZN $AAPL ???
1142 2018-11-21 15:21:26 Keeping any eye on it! With these ozzie stocks it seems like you need to actually make a real discovery before things go really crazy ... not many billion dollar glory holes.

1151 2018-11-21 15:18:15 El mercado avanza 100 puntos en apertura, recuperando parte de sus pérdidas de ayer. Ayer el mercado cerró en el piso técnico de 2640, lo que da una señal de que viene recuperación técnica. #trading #stocks #WallStreet $vix #DowJones #markets

1153 2018-11-21 15:18:00 Economy is not going to slow down. Buy stocks now. Rally time.

1157 2018-11-21 15:17:21 Mr President. If you advance or sign a comprehensive Agreement with China in the next few weeks, Markets will skyrocket again. Main issue now dragging down stocks and assets across the world Dangerous. Not Good. @larry_kudlow @stevenmnuchin1 @IvankaTrump @mike_pence
1158 2018-11-21 15:17:19 More to life and markets then FANG and IBD stocks...look at the charts of net lease REITs $WPC, $O, and $EPR...that's what relative strength looks like
1159 2018-11-21 15:16:49 Wall Street set to open higher as tech shares recover: Wall Street was set to claw back some of the losses from a brutal two-day selloff on Wednesday as Apple Inc and other major technology stocks regained a foothold and oil prices steadied.
1160 2018-11-21 15:16:42 proactive support for small business commencement would be stellar too, but no, subsidies go to large multi national corporations who buy back stocks and lay people off with free money....
1161 2018-11-21 15:16:03 I'm out here putzing along on Robinhood. Not all options available unfortunately. Some stocks aren't even supported.
1162 2018-11-21 15:15:57 Corrections - I’ve said that corrections are opportunities. It takes down good companies with the overpriced. Those are the stocks I hunt for and if they meet my criteria keys I buy. My targets are long term but if they run up fast, I analyze whether to sell or hold.
1163 2018-11-21 15:15:20 @BrianLehrer there are questions not being addressed on this stock market story --- not everyone is 100% in tech stocks! Some took a much smaller haircut on late becs of asset diversification. That needs to be discussed as well.
1164 2018-11-21 15:15:07 Please point this out to them? UK food security and sustainability are now at stake. A food system which has an estimated 3 to 5 days of stocks cannot just walk away from the EU which provides us with 31 per cent of our food. Anyone who thinks that this is simple is ill-informed
1165 2018-11-21 15:14:52 I think it just depends on what you have your money invested in. Tech stocks will probably be fine, but crude oil is dropping and may very well crash completely in 2019.
1166 2018-11-21 15:14:46 Le pétrole se reprend avant les stocks américains
1167 2018-11-21 15:14:15 In all the countries with active stock mkt including India, only 10-20% are the main participants - In India, it might be lower, but in USA the salaried ppl got to invest in stocks to get some tax benefit, so the number is much higher...
1168 2018-11-21 15:12:46 Stocks start higher as tech stocks bounce, oil prices recover

1183 2018-11-21 15:07:57 I’m not a stocks guy but the powers that be call for the deceleration in 2019 driven by tariffs, fading impact of tax cuts and higher borrowing costs caused by the federal reserve.
1184 2018-11-21 15:07:35 It thinks tech stocks may shift from being the bell weather indicator. It means IQT night have taken a hit. All fine and dandy unless maybe you're China. Some great individuals to use as indicators in Space Cos are @thesolarireport tho.

1187 2018-11-21 15:05:28 Chatter Fed backing off, weak econ data- bond yields up nicely, stocks bouncing- okay...maybe someone knows a China deal presser coming...
1188 2018-11-21 15:05:19 Comparing the yield of stocks, which mature at infinity and currently have a duration (~1/div_yield for perpetual security) of about 50 years, to that of bonds that mature in 2 years seems problematic.
1189 2018-11-21 15:04:54 its just insider trading for housing. its not like shelter is as important a commodity to human well-being as stocks.
1190 2018-11-21 15:04:39 Good points. Already thought of zoning in on 1 or 2 stocks ONLY next year. My style changes with markets. I’m sure that’s not real popular... to play one stock. But I’ve been there before.
1191 2018-11-21 15:04:37 U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday after two days of heavy  selling as Apple Inc and other major technology stocks bounced back and  oil prices steadied.

1195 2018-11-21 15:04:04 So why when it looked like Trump was going to win the stock market dropped way down before coming back up if politics has nothing to do with stocks? Just curious, not arguing
1196 2018-11-21 15:03:44 Headline: US stocks surge off poor economic data and decreasing sentiment.
1197 2018-11-21 15:03:01 Liquidity helps all markets. If they don’t want a major crash at stocks and property they will have to keep the money cheap. The beginning trade wars are not helping with inflation. So the outlook not too good. That being said crypto has crashed already so the place to be atm

1203 2018-11-21 15:01:05 9/ Insiders selling stock options, on a short bump, that they were paid to get them to think long-term, indicates loss of confidence & anticipated fall in share price. Share price is a multiple of revenue. As revenue falls, stocks becomes over valued & the composite indexes fall.
1204 2018-11-21 15:00:23 Market turbulence or not, the Fed is expected to go ahead with another quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate when it meets in December, though the pullback in stocks and bonds clouds its plans for next year.

1220 2018-11-21 14:53:05 Watching stocks that have taken placings closely.   There's not much liquidity in the market right now so any overhang might take a while to shift and places may become very impatient.

1222 2018-11-21 14:52:23 yeah, it is half science and half art to trade stocks.  when people are sad, wait until they want to kill themselves than be a buyer of stocks and when they are happy and talking about making millions sell. the masses are like a gaggle of geese, dont be a gaggle

1232 2018-11-21 14:49:52 #Bitcoin is down 75 percent from high of $20,000 last December. 
Its 1-year basis is a 30% loss.
But its 5-year basis is the best performing asset class, overshadowing commodities, currencies, stocks and bonds. 

This is just one reason we love #cryptocurrency. It's bonkers.

1242 2018-11-21 14:44:37 Are investors fearful enough to start buying stocks again?
Technical damage has been significant with percentage of stocks in a bear market above 40% again, according to Martin Roberge at Canaccord Genuity.

1244 2018-11-21 14:43:26 But for you, go out... go on vacation, enjoy it, maybe get yourself something nice, throw it into stocks, invent something that makes more money, buy a piece of a company. 

Dunno what you got now but there is so many things to do with even 5K.

1246 2018-11-21 14:42:51 Leuthold: market overvaluation in the 1999/2000 episode was concentrated in roughly the top-50 Mega Caps, while current overvaluation—though arguably not as extreme—afflicts nearly the entire list of publicly-traded U.S. stocks.

1252 2018-11-21 14:40:46 @JohnHuber72 Every time I look at stocks in the consumer staples sector, I always conclude that the conventional categorization of companies leads to occasional mispricing in certain stocks. e.g. What is more essential to you as a consumer: ketchup, cereal, Campbell's Soup,iPhone

1256 2018-11-21 14:39:56 5/ W Bush told Americans trading social security for stocks was good, to go shop & that the economy was great. Retirement accounts were reduced to fraction. The news said the economy was never better as the ultra high net worth sold options and exited Wall Street. Mom & pop lost.
1257 2018-11-21 14:39:41 Stocks start higher. Can we build some momo today. Lots of traders calling it early but we’re expecting record numbers this holiday season with record growth in sales for the last decade. Remember most people don’t follow the stock market. #Thanksgiving
1258 2018-11-21 14:39:39 We could all notify our 401K managers that we won’t stay in ANY defense contractor stocks.

1261 2018-11-21 14:38:41 ...lose, cut losses and run....want to try to pick a bottom, be my guess, it may never come back or it could go to near 0 or 0.  different assets act differently along with their stocks, it depends on balance sheet while others like commodities and for example BTC, another story.

1278 2018-11-21 14:34:05 I reject the idea that global warming is the cause in declining bay scallops on Nantucket Harbor. While some pollution may be contributing I still insist that with too many licenses issued it reduces the scallops stocks.

1291 2018-11-21 14:27:51 1) I never said it happened in one day, nor 3 years (count longer if #LVG and #Moyes are included). #Juventus stocks went down 10% in a space of a night after #Ronaldo rape allegations. You can deny it all you want and I won't say you're "making a fool of yourself"...

1297 2018-11-21 14:24:48 Trump loves to take credit for all time market highs despite the fact we've been having them for 60 years. That's what happens in the longest bull run in history.

1298 2018-11-21 14:24:31 I mean, this is why I don't dabble heavy in individual stocks, it's near impossible to beat the market long term. I'm mostly diversified in MFs and ETFs.
1299 2018-11-21 14:23:47 They probably have a Sadguru type explanation for that. "Stocks have memory. If you're angry with a company and stare at its stocks, they go down". Crap like that

1314 2018-11-21 14:19:00 1) Expect insiders to buy huge portions (stocks worth several $100.000 in 1-2 weeks).

2) Expect 3 new investment banks to initiate coverage this quarter.

3) Expect at least 1 new CrossLayer deal every week.

4) Expect more exposure, investor presentation a 3-5 year plan etc.
1315 2018-11-21 14:18:29 Sir, does "tax loss selling" have anything to do with this, in your view?  If so, how does that typically play out (by which I mean the effects on stocks after that is finished)?  And when would that season end?

1324 2018-11-21 14:16:14 Source for those figures? PS: It's likely that UK would have to negotiate its allowable catch after Brexit and it's required to ensure conservation of fish stocks and to co-operate with regional or global organisations in achieving this... I take it you like herring?
1325 2018-11-21 14:15:47 But does that mean retail stocks will increase over the holiday?
1326 2018-11-21 14:15:46 Probably but big money decides fate of stocks ..chartists dont
1327 2018-11-21 14:15:40 Yes, any idiot knows that trickle down economics does not work. The rich will invest in stocks instead of creating jobs. But stupid people keep believing the con men who sell this lie.

World hates trump and is looking to do business with non-USA based companies.  Secondly, the HUGE BUDGET DEFICITS.
1342 2018-11-21 14:09:23 Let's help you understand why ppl who think the economy is "great" are subjective:
* 84% of stocks owned by top 10%
* 40M in poverty
* $1.5T in student loan debt
* 45M forgo meds due to costs
* 40% of adults can't cover $400 emergency
* 45K/year die from lack of health insurance

1349 2018-11-21 14:06:21 I think the China trade war is the largest culprit in the Wall Street losses. China is close to crumbling on trade and if we hold out we should regain with exception of tech stocks which are mostly overvalued anyway.

1351 2018-11-21 14:06:09 Oct. Durable goods orders came in much weaker than expected, including unexpected downward revisions for Sept.  Everyone believes this bear market in stocks is just a healthy correction, as they believe the economy boom remains intact, even as evidence of the bust mounts.
1352 2018-11-21 14:05:34 It’s not really a coincidence that ever since you guys starting running this ad about a month ago, pot stocks have gone in the tank. You’re about 3 years late on this. How are you guys even a thing anymore?
1353 2018-11-21 14:05:09 Marijuana stocks have continued to present massive upside potential in a market that is growing faster than anything we see today. With this, however, comes a large amount of volatility and room for risk, but this is characteristic of most new markets.

1358 2018-11-21 14:03:02 When you read the comments down, it is the same sentiment shared of tech stocks...even the people that say the right things struggle hard with change. I can pull 100 articles from finance folks talking about Facebook being the biggest IPO bust of all time.
1359 2018-11-21 14:03:02 I have MANU stocks and sold shares , “sell high buy low”   At above 20+ share still massively overvalued and the NYSE  will continue to correct it self your stock advice is like most of Man United articles.

1361 2018-11-21 14:02:24 Energy stocks ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Hess (HES) all lost ground after US oil prices plummeted 7% to a 13-month low of $53.43 a barrel. Fears of a supply glut and weaker demand have knocked crude into a bear market. It's now down 30% from the recent high on October 3.
1362 2018-11-21 14:01:59 How long did it take dotcom stocks to re-reach their ATHs again after the bubble and bust? Yet 20 years later we see the tech everywhere. 

There may not be another crypto bull run as we know it. Don't get mixed up in the "next bull run" narrative. #crypto
1363 2018-11-21 14:01:52 Taking credit for this as well as plunging stocks?
1364 2018-11-21 14:01:07 These are the days when I wonder why I am focused on shorting.  Stocks start ripping, gapping and no shares are available.
1365 2018-11-21 13:59:33 Gas is the highest it’s been in years. Stocks are getting hammered and are down for the year. Sane individuals don’t believe a word you say. Pass to the Saudis to protect your business interests. Farmers are getting screwed tariff style. You are corrupt. Not all that great.

1374 2018-11-21 13:56:53 @jimcramer complaining about Fed raising rates on @MadMoneyOnCNBC. 
Sorry, you live by the sword you die by the sword. Stocks were fueled by QE now will fall with QT. You support monetary central planning now deal with it.

(Also, don't worry too much. There'll be more QE.)
1375 2018-11-21 13:56:26 Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.

Ignore the noise, trust the code.

1379 2018-11-21 13:54:23 Amen to that. Also mostly due to tech stocks run by liberal zillionaires who would do anything to bring down any success due President Trump, just sayin.

1478 2018-11-21 13:27:34 I guess you don’t have stocks. They’ve lost all gains for the whole yesrKim increased nuke production. Total failed
1479 2018-11-21 13:27:18 Looks like stocks are getting cheaper, too!  Housing is next to become more affordable thanks to the tax cut that will force many seniors and others on fixed incomes to in April when they see their taxes go up.
1480 2018-11-21 13:27:17 STOCKS DOWN and so is  approval ratings!

1483 2018-11-21 13:26:20 My portfolio somewhat decimated the past 2 months, its balance drip dripping away like financial water torture. Still have faith in my strategy which was forged in similar times. While the MM nonsense on #AIM frustrates, I believe in the fundamentals and futures of my stocks. GLA
1484 2018-11-21 13:26:19 Stocks 1: Camino a un repunte. Los futuros de los índices de U.S. apuntan a la alza, todo indica que las acciones de las empresas tecnológicas se recuperarán. Los futuros del #NASDAQ 100 suben un  0.75%, los futuros del #Dow, un 0.4% y los futuros del S&P 500, un 0.5%.
1485 2018-11-21 13:26:06 Moving from stocks to cash and timing the market in retirement accounts can be quite dangerous. Yes, it depends on time to 59 1/2-70 1/2
Someone under 40 that has 20 years to go, should NOT worry.
Most that sell will BUY back 10% higher than their sales.
1486 2018-11-21 13:26:04 Oil & gas is my livelihood. I'd love him to explain where the "tax cut" shows up for my family & others like it. Product prices aren't falling. Gas isn't cheaper. Companies aren't using increased margins to give bonuses or improve pay. Just rich folks scooping depressed stocks.
1487 2018-11-21 13:25:56 Atleast their SD 625 stocks are over.. 
1488 2018-11-21 13:25:52 Ah yes, the daigou (代购?) shoppers that have plagued all of the luxury stocks. It's cute when they pretend that they don't like the practice, etc. but in reality quite different.
1489 2018-11-21 13:25:24 Those knucklehead. As long as the regime fall down. Lol. The currency drops, stocks crashing, unwise decision of policymakers. Smh. Nothing is change.

1495 2018-11-21 13:23:52 Hargreaves Lansdown telling me today UK Private health care provider stocks are climbing on prospects of PM’s deal being implemented. What does that tell you about the privatisation prospects Of National Health Services in the Devolved Nations.

1497 2018-11-21 13:22:11 No. In fact, they invented Capitalism, and became the most successful Civillzation of all time with it. Study Roman Private Law, you will find that Rome, for example, was a titanic free-market metropolis. They even had stocks markets.

1502 2018-11-21 13:19:43 Yeah thats one way of conviction on same day, had the news coame little after market opened cud have given room to exit, but again as u said these stocks are prone to news coming anytime!
1503 2018-11-21 13:19:40 Yo pienso que la intolerancia de algunos es que se use dinero para esa porción de la población que no logra entrar dentro del capitalismo porque sus stocks solo alcanzan para utilizarlos en gastos corrientes y no de capital.
1504 2018-11-21 13:18:49 Doesn't the same happen with stocks? Why compare YoY returns? How about going back 2,3,4,5 years? 

Investing in $BTC isn't about just the profits, it's about having the belief in the idea of deregulated and decentralized value and wealth. 

There's no plight.
1505 2018-11-21 13:18:48 The market is tanking because tech stocks are losing money and people are basing their buys/sells on one facet of the economy and not considering all the gains and plusses throughout. IOW, people are hanging on to tech losers, not national gains and accomplishments.
1506 2018-11-21 13:18:31 The stock tanked because of Technology stocks. Facebook, Apple & Tweeter.
There dishonesty and yours people got tired of.
Fake Democrat News. N Korea does not send rockets over Japan any longer. It will take time, 
Every President gave them all they wanted, they can't deal with
1507 2018-11-21 13:18:19 The stock market is still up 27% over the past two years since the election even with the recent correction. Tech stocks leading the selloff for a reason. For those saying stocks lower than when @realDonaldTrump took office. #MAGA
1508 2018-11-21 13:17:59 Idk, I think #keemstar knows bots been weakened by #youtube like they do every November every year, he rants about it every year, just check back his tweets, that's hilarious. So he's trying to use #leafyishere to sell his scams ("girls", "pyramid stocks")...to whom though ?
1509 2018-11-21 13:17:42 CAP is the only reason some (non-millionaire) UK farmers can continue to farm and CFP is the primary reason there are still fish stocks worth catching in the North Sea. I suspect CFP likely to continue in some form, regardless of the fraudulent promises made by brexiteers.

Your base isn’t smart enough to understand the amount of damage that you’re creating by aligning with murderous dictators (like the Putin & the Crown Prince)... Gas prices = UP!

1540 2018-11-21 13:07:14 No they weren't. CAP is to subsidise French farmers and generate waste by ignoring the rules of supply and demand. CFP kills destroys fishing communities whilst doing little to preserve stocks. There is no English govt in the UK. #yourenotverybright

1547 2018-11-21 13:06:15 How come YG have 205.1B revenue but only 1.5B net profit? Did they invest huge money lately? I know SM is buying stocks from diff. companies & taking them under SM so their net profit is way lower than their revenue. Did YG also acquire any companies lately or are they expanding?
1548 2018-11-21 13:05:57 Here it is - when your stocks are falling, bring up this old chestnut and follow it with words about the wonderful military. So predictable. So pitiful.
1549 2018-11-21 13:05:50 Yes, all of the defense stocks have plummeted because dems don’t want to protect Americans
1550 2018-11-21 13:05:44 Dow finishes down 550 points as stocks erase all 2018 gains. Thank you Mr President and Saudi Arabia. But lets fall lower!

1551 2018-11-21 13:05:36 Will see lower if G20 no deals at all. China gets hit to 25% taxes in 2019. Also 50 on the way then stocks are all in dip holes.
1552 2018-11-21 13:05:08 When food shopping, you stock up when the prices drop, not rise. Don't do stocks any differently. They're on sale! They'll come back. Buy low, sell high, not the other way around.
1553 2018-11-21 13:05:06 Good time to buy tech stocks! Buy low and sell high.
1554 2018-11-21 13:04:49 That's why i said treated like penny stocks.

1558 2018-11-21 13:03:31 These five tech stocks combined have lost more than $800 billion in market value.
1559 2018-11-21 13:03:08 And what bearing does the stock market have on anything? It’s a capital generation tool. Low interest rates means no need to issue stocks. Enlighten me. MAGA!

1561 2018-11-21 13:02:27 Russian wheat export was about 20MMT for Jul.-mid Nov. This is 4.4MMT per month at avg. I suppose 12-13MMT of wheat will be shipped until Jul. 2019 vs. 19MMT for the same period a year ago. This could be 1.7MMT per month at avg. Wheat stocks are 25% lower, prices will be firmer..

1578 2018-11-21 12:57:39 People are wondering whether cryptocurrency can ever be as good as stocks.

Stocks will never be as good as the resource token of the blockchain that wins the next iteration of the "smart contract" wars.
1579 2018-11-21 12:57:29 Amazing how leftist are happy when stocks fall. Im guessing they would be happier with high unemployment rates too.
1580 2018-11-21 12:56:43 I usually write options on the stocks that I want to get rid of. The ones I intend to keep for long term, I try to avoid writing calls. I find it tough to resist myself from writing calls on my long term picks. calls for lot of discipline.

1592 2018-11-21 12:53:26 Before pension funds (stemming from FINSAC collapse) could invest specific %s of their holdings in assets such as Gov’t Paper, Stocks, USD etc. None in venture capital and the like. This change from 0% to 5% for VC will release $25 bn of funding access. Major for SMEs & small biz
1593 2018-11-21 12:53:05 You’re thanking Saudi Arabia, knowing that they had a WP journalist dismembered, and after telling us that we produce the most oil in the world?  We’ll need low gas prices since we’re all losing money on stocks. Looks like all gains have now been lost, thanks to you!

1596 2018-11-21 12:52:45 Stocks are easy to understand. More earnings, more eps, more growth, more dividend, higher P/E, higher share price !

Bonds ? Rates go up, demand down for low-rate bonds, fall in market price of existing stock (yield rises) - market value loss !

Get it ?

1602 2018-11-21 12:50:17 Few stocks were up in down market yesterday. The fads won’t work FAANGs, crypto, cannabis. Back to fundamentals,  quality, sustainable growth. Indexes might go side ways but lot of undervalued stocks will outperform imo. Amazon for example, priced in a decade in 1yr. $500B!

1604 2018-11-21 12:49:48 That had a little impact too, but it's not the primary reason for the Pemex bonds sunken. I mean, no other oil company bonds or stocks are falling as the Pemex one does.

1608 2018-11-21 12:48:28 My mother called last nite. Said the guy on the radio says we should be concerned about the FANG stocks.

That is all.
1609 2018-11-21 12:46:52 Hello Helene- do those ratios distinguish between buys vs sales? For example, if I were to sell a put to open, would that contribute to increasing the p/c? I ask because VVIX has been very stable on this move down in stocks which makes me think there is a lot of premium sellers
1610 2018-11-21 12:46:23 In today’s NYT - These 5 Tech Stocks Combined Have Lost More Than $800 Billion in Market Value - technology stocks never could price correctly
1611 2018-11-21 12:46:22 So, what the #FederalReserve is doing is helping to restore normalcy. Yes, #housing is cooling. But that's GOOD. Prices were rising at paces far outpacing wages/salaries. Yes, #FAANG stocks are falling. But that's after notching extraordinary gains ...

1617 2018-11-21 12:40:35 The market is just now starting to show the impact of #Trumpenomics. Tech stocks in free-fall, the market is now run almost totally by algorithm very few humans know how to stop it.  The systems pick up word cues.  What he tweets out comes back on investors and the whole nation.
1618 2018-11-21 12:40:25 It is quite simple. The people asks for justice. The right says no way. The revolution starts. The right has the army. The revolution is exterminated. The people get into moral and economic misery. And the stocks go up. The only good news is that this leads to humankind end...
1619 2018-11-21 12:40:12 I agree with research, but not every one can be reached.  Stocks are lindy. Bitcoin is not. As a result many simply do not know, they assume since stock shares are bought as a whole unit the same is true of bitcoin.  They still need plenty of education and research

1623 2018-11-21 12:37:56 My take in @FinancialTimes this morning. It was an “absolute bloodbath for technology stocks”, said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. “Anything tech related is getting smoked.”

1718 2018-11-21 11:45:35 He should just throw all that into stocks and by the time he gets out he will be rich
1719 2018-11-21 11:44:43 Have to look at figures in the context of total market value. Even with such large figures, a typical investment portfolio consisting of these stocks may only be down 10%, while a typical crypto portfolio in 2018 is down 80 - 90%
1720 2018-11-21 11:44:09 Sanctions day for ITALY. Stocks falling, the war with European Union has now just started today.

1735 2018-11-21 11:32:58 Bonjour,

Non, désolé. Ce produit n'est plus fabriqué (il a été mis en vente il y a 10 ans) et semble être en rupture de stocks un peu partout. Nous avons d'autres modèles d'aspirateurs balais disponibles mais ils ne sont pas pareils (au niveau du manche par exemple).
1736 2018-11-21 11:31:34 Correct me if I’m wrong: is the logic here that gilts become the safe haven (low bond yield = high bond price) compared to stocks, ie stocks expected to have weak growth?
1737 2018-11-21 11:30:39 Still bs. We never talked about it for 10 years. I forgot and it wasn't a promise. I didn't go to law school (my dad died when I made up my mind to go), and he was buying properties and investing in stocks for 10 years, in addition to 6 figure salary. I didn't even benefit. Smh
1738 2018-11-21 11:27:48 People keep hating on my company but like jokes on you when I work for a company with private stocks that have been rising tremendously compared to y’alls stock that you invested thousands of dollars in....

1757 2018-11-21 11:14:42 I agree with your context. But arguing on wrong notion that markets are 0 sum game. Lets say A paid to B Rs.100 as cost for CE. So B earned 100 (minus his costs of holding stocks) & at end of month Both made money, Total 2% profit got distributed among A & B & both happy. No loss

1760 2018-11-21 11:12:58 % doesn't matter with options only R/R and probability. Let's be realistic seeing these stocks do more than 3-5% on any given day is usually not the case.

1764 2018-11-21 11:11:41 Some investors make money from selling short stocks. Say AAPL, once it’s stock drop to certain level, it won’t drop further because it looks cheap for its fundamentals. But for Bitcoin, there is no fundamental. Some short sellers are making a killing here.

1839 2018-11-21 10:14:49 With so few stocks in the Voyager, I am building a watch list of ex-holdings that have fallen by anything from 20-40% since my sales in recent months, the likes of #CCC, #KWS, #SCT, #XPD, #GFRD: #OTB? I still expect a “lower end of expectations” from OTB. 1/2

1843 2018-11-21 10:13:21 Interesting, thanks for sharing! Just finished calculating the carbon stocks for Welsh marshes yesterday... & our estimates are 2 orders of magnitude higher than these figures! I have checked the paper & I can't find if their estimates are for 1 m of soil or maybe just topsoil?!
1844 2018-11-21 10:12:28 Mark's criteria uses relative strength line (i.e. wrt to other stocks/index) and not the RSI (Relative Strength Index). RS compares against other stocks whereas RSI compares against itself. Using RSI(14) is incorrect if trying to create Mark Minervini screener.

If you're buying a stocks for short-term say less than 2 years= More weightage is for Valuations.

For medium-term say less than 5 years= More weightage is for Growth.

For long-term say more than 10 years= More weightage is for Quality.

Key word: "Weightage"

1884 2018-11-21 09:32:13 True. The reversal of value stocks in the past was often sudden and furious, and when it happens, nobody really expects it. The gap up can be massive, but one has to be in the market to benefit from it. Timing the exact bottom is virtually impossible.

2202 2018-11-21 06:01:12 What are we waking up to? Sell off on #equity #markets continues with the #S&P, #Dow and #Nasdaq all closing lower last night. S&P and Dow are now negative for this year. Asian stocks have fallen while #Brent slipped to $61.73, #Oil has recovered slightly to $63.60.
2203 2018-11-21 06:00:23 It's November 21, 2018 at 02:00PM. Does anyone have any interesting #financial #stocks #tech stories to share?
2204 2018-11-21 06:00:00 buy now. limited stocks available. charot.
2205 2018-11-21 05:59:49 @mabena_bob being silly again, now a minister can't have a share portfolio in the top 40 stocks on the JSE? What shares would be acceptable to you? Do you not have a pension fund?
2206 2018-11-21 05:56:11 America first. So far great Job President Trump. Just stick to doing stuff by the Books and as you are and Im proud to call you president. Ps if your going to try to ban bump stocks and such ..do not pull an obama..do it the fair legal way .
2207 2018-11-21 05:55:38 Make it better to use stocks to buy instead of cash.
2208 2018-11-21 05:55:28 The joy of the stock market. Just watching the djia get crushed today killed me. I want people to make money not lose it.
Well except for the scam that was bitcoin. That can go into the peso stocks for all I care.. sorry if you put good money into it. But...

2212 2018-11-21 05:51:37 Why should taxpayers subsidise your investment? If it's new stock no issue as we need new housing. If you can't afford that then there's stocks, term investments etc etc.

2217 2018-11-21 05:42:51 @VoteOjeda2020 - Oppose Democrat-proposed gas tax! Say no to REGRESSIVE taxes which hit poor the hardest. PROGRESSIVE taxes cost fat cats more. Abolish #SocialSecurity cap of $127,200. Enact 1% #WallStSalesTax on turnover of all stocks, bonds and derivatives - Result = Trillion$

2219 2018-11-21 05:42:41 Adani Group stocks have started outperforming overall market, it is around same time 5 years back they had started outperforming sensing BJP win in 2014. Market strongly sensing BJP Return in 2019?

2221 2018-11-21 05:40:39 Another clue for #crypto investors: If whole market sinks, it’s not that you bought bad #crypto tokens. Same as with stocks. In 2008 all stocks collapsed over night. That’s always a sign that you have to wait it out, since it’s a global action that just loves the sin() fx. #wait

2227 2018-11-21 05:35:02 Sounds like "pump and dump" as is done with some stocks. The difference is that Trump's foreign policy has the potential to illegally manipulate value for his own gain.
2228 2018-11-21 05:34:40 "I came to the conclusion that the only stocks which would be of real interest to me would be those that were breaking all previous records: stocks not merely rising in price, but actually in their highest boxes ever."  - Nicolas Darvas

2232 2018-11-21 05:32:34 And if you’re Long Term in “boring ass” defensive stocks with dividends above 3% when you bought em.  Don’t even look until you have dependents #UnlessitsGE
2233 2018-11-21 05:32:00 Just stick to stocks
2234 2018-11-21 05:30:59 Currently it's 
1) Market manipulation
2) market crash in all stocks, bonds, etc.
3) get rich quick type of investors are capitulating at loss
4) no apparent improvement in crypto scalable txn.
5) lack of good UI UX in crypto products.

2235 2018-11-21 05:30:51 Yeah the performance of the stocks is quite interesting.  Not indicative of a new paradigm.
2236 2018-11-21 05:29:47 Thank u for your response @GrantPattison I fully understand limited stocks & while stocks last since it is BF but there should not be a price discrepancy on exact same bundle at 2 different stores with a diff of more than R1200.  Can I get the deal at Cornubia if stock is avail?

2248 2018-11-21 05:23:40 After decades trading the markets almost every successful trader develops a 'ZERO loyalty to stocks mindset'.

Amateurs on the other hand, 'fall in love with their stocks'.

The good news is: You do have a choice!
2249 2018-11-21 05:23:24 Not necessarily. I have been paying attention to the price of gold and silver, along with stocks and bitcoin. Keep in mind the market cap of the 3. Huge drops in stocks and crypto can easily only amount to a couple dollar move up in gold.
2250 2018-11-21 05:23:11 Your stockbroker or firm offers mixes of stocks from different areas of business & industry that will ‘hedge your bet’ - ie if some tank others are sure to make up for it in the mix. 

All of them have to be relatively non-risk unless expressly explained to you that they are.
2251 2018-11-21 05:22:39 Interesting, the stocks you have mentioned in this tweet have all been multibagger in 20 years..and likely to be in the next 20! #midasinvest #multibaggers
2252 2018-11-21 05:22:31 Where did you go to begin looking into stocks?
2253 2018-11-21 05:21:14 How ‘bout the 5 FAANG stocks collapsing… Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Google parent Alphabet
2254 2018-11-21 05:20:51 Make that a $3.8m EV. At this rate we will be shell value in a week with some great ground and a heap of exploration ongoing. Or you could chase stocks in Paterson with way higher caps 
2255 2018-11-21 05:19:39 Same here. We will find our way its only a matter of time. Good profit
2256 2018-11-21 05:19:31 Interesting. Trump gets elected and the stocks skyrocket. 
Dems take the house and stocks free fall. Just the thought of Dems having power can destroy an economy
2257 2018-11-21 05:18:32 I put that question to a lawyer friend of mine. I indicated I’d wanted my stock to go into small business. He said: The stock should be picked so it earns You money, you know, not them. 

But basically, stocks have a rating system for that reason. To prove projected worth.
2258 2018-11-21 05:18:20 Rather than a fixed number of large/small cap stocks, MS uses a flexible system. Large-cap stocks are the group that account for the top 70% of the capitalization of the geographic area Asia-Pacific ex-Japan; mid-cap stocks represent the next 20%; small-cap stocks the balance. 2/

2260 2018-11-21 05:17:10 check your stocks. and next morning you’ll just woke up to the news they close down your stores.
2261 2018-11-21 05:16:09 That's right! They are numbered and limited but they do not send the stocks to stores in one go so some may still expect to receive more. Our stores here are still accepting reservations as their first batch sold out fast. Good luck!! Hope you get it.

2278 2018-11-21 05:06:27 I mean, practically none of us own stocks.
2279 2018-11-21 05:05:33 Call stores! I think the stocks go in batches so you can ask if they can still accept reservations.

2284 2018-11-21 05:03:22 The corporate commentary, post Q2 results, continues to be cautious. May not be a bad idea, to raise cash levels, in portfolios. If one has to buy stocks, margin of safety will need to be very high!!
2285 2018-11-21 05:02:42 Stocks made my day with that raid 
2286 2018-11-21 05:02:40 We need additional stocks guyyyy. Rest of world site

2288 2018-11-21 05:01:51 Well he needs to be made to rue it - which he would if the platform was as neutral and unbiased as it should be. If #Twitter has an anti-Hindu agenda - we need to gradually shift out and disinvest in the stocks
2289 2018-11-21 05:01:15 I agree. Technically we are already in a bear market with 70 percent of most stocks 20 percent of their highs. A down turn which would likely have happened no matter who was President has been accelerated by his idiotic trade policies.
2290 2018-11-21 05:01:04 I understand your thesis, however I used to buy down trending stocks with disastrous results, waiting usually yrs to breakeven or make a profit. If you wait for the market to tell you the bottom is in, via higher highs & lows your probability of success skyrockets.

2292 2018-11-21 05:00:25 Funny how the left gets control of something & stocks price start to decline could it be investors know a bunch of growth choking regulations are on the way again. The stock market boomed because we knew regulations were getting scaled back even though Obama wants to take credit
2293 2018-11-21 04:59:40 Set special flags only on high, start with 3 stocks. 

The goal is to swat everyone else away and use the special flag to gain more stocks

This ideally works with 4-6 people and on a moderate size stage such as Duck Hunt.
2294 2018-11-21 04:59:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2295 2018-11-21 04:58:19 Just as stocks  go to zero bitcoin could soon meet that fate. Stick with real assets that produce real long-term income.
2296 2018-11-21 04:58:00 It's how people react in the market that tells you the true nature of the market. We are not in good market conditions right now as pointed by me earlier too, if we just look at the way stocks are reacting to minor minor disappointments

2309 2018-11-21 04:51:29 Trade war is scaring investors so stocks are plummetting.

Regulation is scaring investors so cryptos are plummetting.

Both market reactions are fear based. Fear is an emotion, emotions do not last forever. Massive market selloffs are where gems are found.

2314 2018-11-21 04:48:19 .@MichaelAvenatti: @bennyjohnson is extremely vulnerable to his audience. In his Daily Caller interview, Trump said he wants to work with the Dems on amnesty. That's like if Bernie came out for bump stocks.

Benny didn't say a peep about Trump pushing amnesty. Use against him.

2318 2018-11-21 04:45:14 My uncle. Owned a cabinet shop, nice home, net worth a bit north of $1MM. Lost nearly all of it day trading on .com stocks and spent the rest of his life drinking himself to death.
2319 2018-11-21 04:44:24 is it a good strategy to buy tech stocks when FAANG are falling
2320 2018-11-21 04:43:26 #BankNifty #Nifty Today is a settlement holiday. Stocks bought yesterday will not be available for selling today.
2321 2018-11-21 04:43:24 GLOBAL MARKET TODAY 
Asian stocks fell after another tumble on Wall Street, where concerns have spread to the corporate-bond market. Investors are also contending with no obvious havens, with Treasuries little changed so far this week and gold weaker.
2322 2018-11-21 04:43:02 Banking stocks: Indian banks may get a reprieve of about Rs 13,400 crore in capital exemption, as announced by the RBI board on Monday. The government stands to gain the most from this as RBI move would lessen the burden on it to help state-run banks.
2323 2018-11-21 04:42:11 You better cos stocks are low 
2324 2018-11-21 04:42:08 Deflation period where all stocks and commodities move down to push every one to cash the then hyperinflation? Then banks buy assets for the low and sell them back at a major mark up from their gains prior. Global reset from reserve notes incoming? Idk? To many youtube videoeslol
2325 2018-11-21 04:40:35 fwiw i was looking through sports reference for stocks guys and it seems this freshman class is off to an awful start there
2326 2018-11-21 04:40:30 Now you're a stock expert. There's ways to make money in stocks whether they go up or down. But I'll buy your book when it comes out.
2327 2018-11-21 04:40:17 We did that last year and soon after, stocks went sky high. Now I'm ok with my choice. Can't take the drama!
2328 2018-11-21 04:38:17 We know this is an incredibly popular promotion, each character is limited edition and while stocks last. We'll let our relevant team know that your stores have ran out, and they'll look into what they can do to ensure the store doesn't run out again. 2/2
2329 2018-11-21 04:37:11 I can’t stop playing in the stock market. 
Not even kidding. I started reading about it in the past month...I’m hooked. 
It’s so freaking fun!
I’m probably gonna lose my ass, but I have found some pretty cool stocks that I think will be amazing soon!  
I’m such a grown up. Wow.
2330 2018-11-21 04:36:45 Ive been thinking it seems quite weird that stocks are getting hammered but bonds aren’t going anywhere.
2331 2018-11-21 04:35:45 One good thing about Trump is that the good stocks go on Sale so frequently. Obama made the stocks waaaay too expensive to buy any. 

It's like when Bush ran that big sale on land and houses.
2332 2018-11-21 04:35:42 In Nov edition of @OutlookBusiness , Kamal Khetan CMD of Suntek Realty says he expects 20-25% return p.a. on his personal equity invstmnts. Sunteck Realtys ROE for 10 yrs is 7% & s stocks last 10 yrs CAGR is 12.19%. Waah bhai..apni co. ka 7% ROE & equity invstmnts he wants 20-25%
2333 2018-11-21 04:35:23 Value of the market is increasingly concentrated in a few stocks. Everyone chasing growth/returns.

What kind of growth does Netflix need to justify trading at 95 P/E?

You think they’re closer to start-up or mature company? See how much debt they’ve taken?

2337 2018-11-21 04:31:32 also if you have money in stocks, I would get it out. With the artificial boom, it's sure to collapse very soon.
2338 2018-11-21 04:30:48 That's great need Cath. So much opportunity for the commoners weaving marajuana stocks into baskets and stuff so we don't need plastic. This is such a great opportunity for non civil servants to make a bit more $$
2339 2018-11-21 04:30:20 Will watch for reversals tomorrow on strong stocks today. Was a few... but bearish engulfing with drops in XLF XLI should be telling.
2340 2018-11-21 04:29:32 ON HAND STOCKS FOR SALE TO BE POSTED 6PM KST!!! 
2341 2018-11-21 04:28:33 I can list 5 stocks (not American) which have been trading at 50% of their intrinsic value calculated via DCF model for more than a decade even in this 10 year bull. In the end, what matters is PA on the charts. If you think anything else, you are just another gambler
2342 2018-11-21 04:27:53 But us stock markets, as the Aussie stocks don’t have as much volatility as the us on a day to day basis
2343 2018-11-21 04:27:49 This is a good point. I only trade individual stocks in IRAs. My other accounts - HSA, DCP, defined benefit - have only fund options.
2344 2018-11-21 04:27:39 in-demand na siya nung di pa pino-post yan ni isda. Tapos nung pinost na niya (and nag-decide akong bumili) biglang pahirapan na sa stocks kasi di na raw uso HAHAHA
2345 2018-11-21 04:27:37 Best part was him criticizing Tom Lee today for being wrong on bitcoin (no opinion), but buddy have you read what you've been saying about FANG stocks for the last five years???
2346 2018-11-21 04:27:20 خليكم متفائلين يا جماعه.. ترى الأرزاق بيد الرزاق .. كل شي بيترتب
2347 2018-11-21 04:27:17 Non-niche setups should never even be in your mind. ONLY trade your specific edge and in the market we are in legging In is a necessity with the ranges of stocks. Need confirmation before size is earned
2348 2018-11-21 04:26:27 Telecom Stocks are falling like a a rock & this is their way to cut their losses by scamming us all. Govt entities are in their pocket. We both know how Vodafone has got away with not paying Tax to the Income tax department.
2349 2018-11-21 04:26:18 ya I know all about how stocks work. Stock traders depend a lot on intrinsic value of the company and believe that its a buying opportunity when it is trading below its intrinsic value. So? How does a stock holding give you control over the future of that company?
2350 2018-11-21 04:26:12 CUMI is far better than Wendt in every aspect, holding both in my PF.
Though Wendt is a micro cap, very small cap mfgs superior abbrasive products than CUMI.
Considering low equity, little floating stocks n excellent numbers may offer better chances of appreciation than CUMI.
2351 2018-11-21 04:25:06 I would certainly choose the first basket but if I could choose the 3: $BKNG $GOOG $PEP Also...1. Earnings are not the same as FCF. 2. None of those stocks are what anyone would consider "value" stocks at the moment. 3. Margin of Safety is vague (I.e. It's typically asset based).
2352 2018-11-21 04:24:16 He probably quietly stocks up on French toast making supplies before the stores sell out 

2353 2018-11-21 04:24:14 I’m with you on this. I am selling ETFs on rallies, and escaped the October melt down. Moving toward individual stocks and take my chances.
2354 2018-11-21 04:24:08 That is not true. And if your god is so awesome why did stocks drop today?
2355 2018-11-21 04:23:51 Stocks are forward looking. These stats are backwards looking. One possible reason for the discrepancy.

2357 2018-11-21 04:21:54 Your chief of staff promised you would get behind legislating a ban on bump stocks over a year ago. You are full of lies and NRA blood money. #enough
2358 2018-11-21 04:19:53 I think it's a lethal idea. It could get very dangerous & could lead to more complications. Besides why not have the same provisions for equity funds too. Delisted stocks can be put aside for any future turn around possibilities

Sell on rise mode.....

correction in IT stocks likely to result out-performance in #Banknifty in comparison to #Nifty.
2362 2018-11-21 04:17:25 Well if that happens to a strong stock like MSFT then most other stocks go back to those November 2016 pre-election levels or lower? The SPX was 2100 then fwiw. NFLX was 125..........
2363 2018-11-21 04:15:55 Frwd

If you're buying a stocks for short-term say less than 2 years= More weightage is for Valuations.

For medium-term say less than 5 years= More weightage is for Growth.

For long-term say more than 10 years= More weightage is for Quality.

Key word: "Weightage"
2364 2018-11-21 04:15:30 Away we go,  nibbling at stocks today.
2365 2018-11-21 04:14:47 @ANCALERTS @MaikiOreta keeps on making the same mistake. She keeps calling @RaineMusngi Mimi. I know Michelle Ong usually does the stock analysis but you have to be more focused. It's Raine who's now doing the stocks.

2368 2018-11-21 04:12:40 i'm getting some stocks not displaying their intraday SP data today - TTT BAF as examples - do you have same issue?
2369 2018-11-21 04:12:30 Fair enough , but the owners of radios shack stocks made out great. It’s the little man the franchise owner, the daily worker who lost a job. the small electronics  stores that went under. It’s the same story rich guy invested takes up wealth . Little guys left holding the bag
2370 2018-11-21 04:11:47 Stocks and Oil (Nasdaq below 6500 Brent below 62) are bearing the brunt of this sell-off. BullshitCoin at 4400. This is not over, but there might be a bounce back during the Thanksgiving holiday period. Long USD and Short GBP/EUR/JPY/INR/Gold/Oil stance remains.
2371 2018-11-21 04:11:19 Why investors shouldn't lose sleep over inflation!
Inflation is bad news for investors. It means people shop less, corporate profits are pinched and stocks are less valuable. High inflation increases the likelihood that the RBI will raise interest rates more quickly.
2372 2018-11-21 04:10:54 china stocks pa din ata mga play boss pas. namamahinga lang ata ung mga lumipad na lately
2373 2018-11-21 04:09:22 You guys are really full of sh*t. Stocks give you owner ship of a company. Your not investing in it for dividends. ALOT of companies don’t even issue dividends. You purchase stock of the company and ALL its REAL production.
2374 2018-11-21 04:09:06 Mr&Mrs DonMelanTrump r pathetic laughing stocks. Their lack of or distain4 real active participation &joy in American values, DEMOCRACY & traditional ways is disgusting. #11thhour #msnbc #cnn @JRubinBlogger @davidfrum @SRuhle @RWPUSA @jheil @SteveSchmidtSES @BillKristol
2375 2018-11-21 04:08:45 Game Over, Mark going down with the ship so cancel any hope for box shipments that infringe on memberships, it turned out to be a unresolved conflict of interest so stocks dictating massive loss is not uncommon a 2nd failure of CEB.

2377 2018-11-21 04:07:17 You know one comment from a minister can lead to billions of losses or gains in stocks,

2378 2018-11-21 04:07:11 +12k today! far out its been a long time between ok days for me! Better trades today on $MIN $GXY (Only 2 Lithium stocks with borrow available these days)  $FOD $APT $FMG $A2M ok now back to my intra-day disappearing act!
2379 2018-11-21 04:06:26 Not sure what you did other than chuck on a cc and drag in some stocks
2380 2018-11-21 04:05:44 As bad as this sounds, I hope the stock market keeps declining so it can pose a great buying opportunity. I am looking to increase my position in my current stocks, and load up on some others.
2381 2018-11-21 04:05:33 Anyone who thinks our economy is the “best it’s ever been” must not be looking at the same stocks I’m looking at..... nvm I’m just a lil black girl in Memphis who can’t possibly know what I’m talking about
2382 2018-11-21 04:04:58 I believe he contributed to the perfect storm for stocks deliberately. It's not coincidence they dumped starting that day. He spoke 4 times that week, he never speaks that often in such a short space of time. He knew the effect it would have.
2383 2018-11-21 04:04:06 As soon as President Trump became president stocks and funds went up! Our God is an awesome God! 
2384 2018-11-21 04:03:51 For what? These aren’t stocks. It’s a trading card game.
2385 2018-11-21 04:02:48 My thinking was that Treasuries were getting a safety bid with the turmoil in stocks and in anticipation that rates won't be hiked post Dec. Is that the case though?
2386 2018-11-21 04:02:47 Oh, I'm not falling for the Trump futures fake-out. It's a zero-sum game, man. Get into tech stocks now, while the getting is good. AI, Home Automation, and Drones, that's where it's at. How are you on cryptocurrency?

2392 2018-11-21 04:00:07 We know our government intimately. They can be easily controlled with bribes. And In this case, as telecom stocks are falling, they all must have paid them off to give them complete control over us to force us to pay more. #CronyCapitalism #TelecomScam #CorporateTerrorism

2396 2018-11-21 03:57:52 About AR15s I just don’t have a clue on how to regulate what’s already out there, but I think a weapon like that should be sold to the general public. Ban bump stocks. People w mental health problems should not have access or be able to buy a gun,
2397 2018-11-21 03:57:32 The steep fall in crude is a much bigger positive for us as compared to the negativity from the  sharp fall in the ridiculous valuations of global tech stocks.
2398 2018-11-21 03:56:56 Dit "elles peuvent ne pas en avoir en stocks" donc être obligé de commander, combien de personnes continueront de venir quand à chaque fois "Ah on n'a pas en stocks faut le commander".
Les petites pharmacies (la plupart) peuvent pas se le permettre.
2399 2018-11-21 03:56:17 I remember that. And I'm grateful the gov't took action. Just wish they would do that with guns...make any laws that protect us better. Remember the outrage against bump stocks? Still no Federal law....and only 7 States have banned them at the State level. #GunControlNow
2400 2018-11-21 03:55:10 What if the indicators work in reverse this time and stocks lead credit? Curve has been very flat for awhile. Maybe credit is late to the party

2404 2018-11-21 03:53:41 I know everything about the stocks I own and trade. I've been in the IT industry for 25 years, owned several tech companies going back to the late 90s and retired in my mid-40s. I have also read the BTC whitepaper that you've all been scammed with. Nothing really spectacular...
2405 2018-11-21 03:52:54 It wasn’t a dying tradition, you're just too worried about your feelings getting hurt so you didn’t go. How about you focus on the people that are still missing from the wildfires, focus on fixing the continually plummeting stocks.

2410 2018-11-21 03:51:32 Oh yes, I agree. It can't be kept propped up and I've charted most of the FAANG stocks to retrace between 80-90%. lol. 

I think in that event though people won't be buying gold/silver/bitcoin etc... they'll be cashing out to buy bread and survive an extra day.
2411 2018-11-21 03:50:28 STOCKS FALL! Erasing all 2018 gains! #MAGA have no worries, they don’t have stocks or retirement funds.
2412 2018-11-21 03:50:02 Telecom stocks are falling world over. This is a planned attack so they can maintain their profit. They have govt in their pocket which is why they are able to get away with many scams. Ethical? Pure Fraud. #TelecomScam
2413 2018-11-21 03:49:36 Tencent is doing far better than FANG stocks , the media got Tencent wrong always special Reuter .
2414 2018-11-21 03:49:16 Not really a long way down as they are only at 0.074 with a MC of 55 mill and expected revenue for 2019 of over 60 mill, easy value buy really. $BUB sitting at a MC of over 180 mill with expected 2019 revenue of under 40 mill. I buy value stocks and $JAT is extremely good value.
2415 2018-11-21 03:48:21 Telecom stocks are falling like a rock, hence this is their plan to loot the people to maintain their profit. We need to raise our voice or else they will come up with harsher rules to make us pay more.
2416 2018-11-21 03:45:15 Watch The Stocks
2417 2018-11-21 03:45:04 They literally said “The industry is growing...like a weed” and “cannabis stocks are...flying high”. E-fucking-nuff already!

2421 2018-11-21 03:42:21 As with any overextended asset class, the market in tech stocks is correcting. The influence of these huge names on the rest of the market is staggering because of their sheer size. That said, these companies are still hugely profitable.
2422 2018-11-21 03:42:15 That’s a topic which very near and dear in my lob :)

2428 2018-11-21 03:37:51 Market gains over the last couple of years have been heavily seen in growth stocks, which are dominated by big tech. It’s a crowded trade, and we’re seeing it unwind. A massive shift from growth to value right now.

2454 2018-11-21 03:21:03 What’s the difference between the stock traders who rally ?  I’d say none - except there are no contracts in place to protect investors who invest in and the major investors sell.  Laws are important around this - most founders have exit strategies for stocks - this is same same

2456 2018-11-21 03:20:36 Given the volatility and drawdowns in stock market it takes a certain temperament to keep holding stocks. Not to mention how hard picking individual stocks is, which many undiversified retail investors try to do.

2483 2018-11-21 03:08:06 True statements but how I see it is that even the legit cryptos are being misused... the practice of treating them as "stocks" severely hinders their rate of adoption (mainly its use case/blockchain tech). 

This prevents people from benefiting from great projects like SUB.
2484 2018-11-21 03:06:59 when i see the strength in economy, the jobs report, the gains in sectors since 2009, and ongoing...and then stocks lower their prices?  I'm in.  Count me in as a buyer for the next few days.  Wonderful opportunity!

2491 2018-11-21 03:04:06 I pretty much moved a good portion of my stock portfolio to cash at the right time a couple weeks back. It was more of a coincidence of some stocks hitting my sell point than anything else but the timing will allow me to buy back in hopefully during a very good sale spot.

2501 2018-11-21 02:59:13 I agree, but those that seem to be worrying aren't even fans of the team so what are they worried for in the first place? It's not their club. Hopefully the can execute, but they're in prime position to go any number of ways with large stocks of capital in both dollars & talent.
2502 2018-11-21 02:57:46 Well crypto has gone down quite a bit - to be expected. Stocks have taken a hit also. The Dow over 500 down points. Isn't crypto only about 10 yrs old? not bad
2503 2018-11-21 02:57:27 stocks going down down 
2504 2018-11-21 02:57:04 The stock market has never been a sure thing. Higher interest rates. Tariffs. Deficits. Oil prices. Crazy President. Uncertainty. Bubble. Should be much lower. Unemployment trending lower for years. Few stocks leading parade. Bad breadth.

2506 2018-11-21 02:54:47 Dow jones changes daily. They Sale off stocks, then use that money to buy new stocks. That how it works. Don't worry it will go up again.
2507 2018-11-21 02:54:16 Exactly. Long term approach. We preach the Peter Lynch teachings. Fundamentals, take all the emotion out of it. Well diversified portfolio of stocks, never to over load on any one position no matter how much you love it.
2508 2018-11-21 02:53:58 I have nothing against Cramer, the whole idea is ludicrous. There are like 6k stocks in the US market. To expect anyone to have even a remote thought on any particular stock is insane.

2510 2018-11-21 02:53:49 I bought some stocks today on the market dump. AAPL was definitely not one. 
2511 2018-11-21 02:52:47 But game breaking is subjective. Someone back then couldve posed your exact argument and said, "listen, i know that the freeze glitch and 999 strat makes the IC's the only viable character, but the core of melee is just taking the opponents stocks away"
2512 2018-11-21 02:52:14 I'd say the market is telling who ever wants to listen that stocks rose to far to fast. They will find a normal price like the fed rate and they will beat the 10 yr. 35% up is unavailable
2513 2018-11-21 02:52:08 Dems say that's why we should protect those workers by setting a livable minimum wage, with reasonable corporate taxes to fund worker education programs and incentives that motivate companies to invest profits back into worker wages instead of shareholder stocks and dividends.

2520 2018-11-21 02:47:57 Then you know valuations of “growth” stocks today bears no resemblance to 2000. Can they decline from here? Absolutely. But do you think there is much risk that the “growth” basket listed produces less cash flows than the value basket over 10 years?

For long-term say more than 10 years= More weightage is for Quality.

Key word: "Weightage"

2529 2018-11-21 02:42:48 I’ll buy those growth stocks again down another 20% then I’ll agree with you and I’m the guy who owned them all 4 months ago and pissed I took so long to sell. I was a value mgr 95-2000 that saw what happens when these stocks finally peak and we need more carnage first
2530 2018-11-21 02:41:39 Or we could let some them in and possibly save 1000's of lives.. btw most us citizens do NOT want a ban on guns, only those on the farthest left, just like those that want to legalize silencers and keep bump stocks around tend to be on the far right.. most just want common sense.
2531 2018-11-21 02:41:30 But which group offers more margin of safety in terms of current price of shares vs probability weighted future cash flows? Seems clear to me it’s the “growth” stocks that offer more “value”.
2532 2018-11-21 02:41:26 Ha no way pal. If you were talking about stocks you’d have a point. But with this hollow hoping over these pos coins...you’re nuts
2533 2018-11-21 02:40:43 Reason I threw the stocks back on and didn't give a fuck after
2534 2018-11-21 02:40:03 But which group offers better margin of safety in terms of current price of shares vs probability weighted future 10-year cash flows? Seems very clearly to me it is the “growth” stocks that offer better “value”.
2535 2018-11-21 02:39:32 It was a positive experience but did fall short for me. The foot stocks weren't very comfortable and it was a group tickling thing that was ultimately very short and not as intense as I had hoped it would be. Plus being in mixed company no lewd happened.

2545 2018-11-21 02:36:08 Yeah, you can’t trade a lot of thebturds anymore because a lot of people have blown accounts shorting them.. I’m disappointed about that. They like you to trade stocks with rules(big caps). I adapted.
2546 2018-11-21 02:35:12 So whats the difference between trading stocks and #btc? Nothing. what symbols you have means shit. You sell stocks to get fiat. You sell crypto to get btc or whatever or fiat. But Btc has a different potential one day it may not be traded for more fiat.
2547 2018-11-21 02:34:08 It's so simple. This is classic pre market boom. It had happened since the beginning of markets. Last example was internet boom, absolute blood bath people saying Amazon Google stocks etc are dying. Classic perfect storm.
2548 2018-11-21 02:33:52 idk if paliton kuba ni kay 5 nalang nabilin na stocks and nag sale pajud mygad Lord help me
2549 2018-11-21 02:33:24 They don’t even pay a dividend. Same goes for Google. These stocks are no better than trading in cryptocurrency, except that they have better liquidity and depth.
2550 2018-11-21 02:33:18 Additionally, at the market top, everyone is sucked in. They don't believe you when you say a downturn could be coming. At the top, no one would be telling me "buy bitcoin" as they have been today. Also, no one would be negative on stocks like they are right now.
2551 2018-11-21 02:32:56 Right now... Would you buy 1 APPL stock or 1 ETH?

2555 2018-11-21 02:31:57 Can’t reconcile the common statement that Druckenmiller has never had a down year in 30 years but yet Soros fired him for losing billions of dollars after loading up on tech stocks at the height of the dotcom bubble. Am I missing something?

2558 2018-11-21 02:31:35 Well, it has been a rough couple of weeks for tech stocks. Surely, those who invested in Bitcoin must be feeling relieved it has been scathed.

2560 2018-11-21 02:30:20 So it was you who caused all of their stocks to plummet.
2561 2018-11-21 02:30:09 Either way more stocks would be needed if FS meters would go competitive, so maybe that Roy combo won't be THAT bad with 4-5 stocks.
2562 2018-11-21 02:27:25 Hard to properly compare #cryptocurrency as an asset class vs. #stocks and #bonds as the rules of engagement for #crypto are still TBD — regulation, institutional ownership, liquidity, exchanges, and valuation are in a nascent stage. #bitcoin #bitcoincrash #ethereum
2563 2018-11-21 02:26:35 ‘Possibly’. Bump stocks are legal and likely the ‘fully automatic’ they are talking about.
2564 2018-11-21 02:26:14 horrors stocks just fell 50%
2565 2018-11-21 02:26:11 Stocks took a real L today
2566 2018-11-21 02:25:47 My Roth IRA is entirely invested in index funds (about 50% S&P 500, 30% emerging markets, and 20% other foreign markets). It's only my "play" money than I invest in individual stocks. I don't expect to outperform, but I hope to do alright, have some fun, & learn in the process :)
2567 2018-11-21 02:25:00 Twitterati knew about FANG stocks declining.... And also about the drop in crude... And crypto drawdown...

2568 2018-11-21 02:24:47 According to most of my family:
My stocks are (were) doing ok so Trump is doing great.
According to my husband:
Why do you pay so much attention to politics? What do the Russians matter? Trump is way better than Hillary. 

Fuck them all.

2571 2018-11-21 02:22:45 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as sinking oil prices hit energy companies, tech hardware continued to plunge with Apple leading the way, and retailers saw little joy from the coming Christmas shopping season.
2572 2018-11-21 02:22:25 Asian stocks are back in bear-market territory after another dive on  Wall Street, where concerns have spread to the corporate-bond market.
Equity benchmarks retreated in Japan, Australia and South Korea, while futures show Hong Kong is set to open lower.
2573 2018-11-21 02:22:13 Really? In another month stocks are going to crash 80% like bitcoin? Um...okay. Love the bearishness though. That's a really bullish sign for this stock rally.
2574 2018-11-21 02:21:50 Cues today
Dow Jones down 552 pts,erases gains for 2018

FIIs net sell 753cr in cash yest
2575 2018-11-21 02:21:32 Lol You must never heard of executive compensation. Also when you give corporations more money they buy back their own stocks it might help raise stock prices but it also prevents employee growth and pay increases. Meanwhile putting more money in executive pockets.

2579 2018-11-21 02:20:26 Here is what the law does: A comprehensive bill that includes a provision that raises the age to purchase a gun, bans bump stocks and allows law enforcement, with the approval of a judge, to bar a person deemed dangerous due to mental illness from owning guns for up to a year.
2580 2018-11-21 02:20:04 Brussel sprouts are bump stocks
2581 2018-11-21 02:19:32 Now ya stocks up, type wanted
2582 2018-11-21 02:18:59 2%, that's nothing, pot stocks commonly move 10%+ in a morning session.   fold up your tray table and hang on, because you are about to experience a little turbulence.  what was long is now a big short. giddy up.
2583 2018-11-21 02:18:51 I’d love to see his tax returns. How much has he got invested in arms related stocks?
2584 2018-11-21 02:18:50 What are they doing with the riches? Are they diving into it and swimming around like Scrooge McDuck?

Stock buybacks help those who have retirement tied up in stocks.

2588 2018-11-21 02:15:57 Bump stocks create automatic weapons. See what happened in Las Vegas. I also have a masters degree.
2589 2018-11-21 02:14:12 Ramen stocks are always a win in bad times
2590 2018-11-21 02:14:02 I never short stocks, but I might make an exception for insurance companies.
2591 2018-11-21 02:13:34 You should be on a safer allocation considering we're at the end of a bull run, stocks are the third most expensive they've ever been, and we have a fiscal incompetent as #POTUS. 

Good allocation: 50% stock, 20% bonds, 30% prime money market/cash account (earns 2.25%)
2592 2018-11-21 02:12:51 Ivanka Trump's drop below $5,000 proves its vulnerability compared to stocks and bonds via…
2593 2018-11-21 02:12:37 Yes, and by any metric they’re still the most overpriced stocks in the market
2594 2018-11-21 02:09:07 Yea not happy. But I had the risk highlighted so wasn’t bad. Got burned on a couple buys near the Q but all in all ~300-400% return isn’t bad for 11 months. Wish it would of ended better
2595 2018-11-21 02:08:49 Don’t disagree entirely. But spread your buying over a period of time until we are back to an up market on higher volumes. Finding stocks up on higher volume right now isn’t a bad trade. I need to start putting more into an S&P index fund now. My risk tolerance is lower at 58. :)
2596 2018-11-21 02:08:31 Do you... understand how the economy works?   The richest 1% aren't magically buying 99 times more t-shirts and televisions as the bottom 99%.  Unlike "poor quality" middle class folks, they're actually taking money OUT of the economic cycle in favor of nonsense like stocks.
2597 2018-11-21 02:07:12 oh wow, I haven’t reach the sales booth yet but I got some stocks already for mini photocards from my friend 
2598 2018-11-21 02:06:32 Move into bonds right now. I did a month ago and I actually made money today. They’re not fool prof of course, but when stocks go down then bonds go up. When all of this is over, l’ll be there to buy back into stocks at much lower cost per share.

Good luck. 
2599 2018-11-21 02:06:26 I feel like this explanation makes sense for someone who believes the market is likely to fall over the next couple of years.

2600 2018-11-21 02:05:36 @AriWald Hi Ari, one question...are you still bullish on momentum stocks (e.g. MTUM ETF) after their recent steep selloff? Any change to your outlook?  Thanks!

2616 2018-11-21 02:00:37 Same, now they make fun of it.

They also bought the top for stocks, haha.
2617 2018-11-21 02:00:20 if you're younger you can wait this out. In 5 years this will be a blip on the chart. Think of it as a stock being on sale for 80% of what it cost in September. We still have the exact number of stocks, bonds etc. Its just not valued as highly right now.
2618 2018-11-21 02:00:08 Luke, that is true but not helpful. Answer is probably cash, followed by gold and gold miners, but need to see dollar declining on Fed reversal before going heavy gold related securities. For now, probably cash. Stocks will be an opportunity again; but leaders will change.
2619 2018-11-21 01:59:05 No you don't understand the power of Preeti aapa and her club members. They single handedly managed to bring down all tech stocks.
What do you think of them eh? All world leaders how before them . Mind it you rascal.
2620 2018-11-21 01:59:01 Starting to see a slight break today. Even though the Dow traded down on above average volume. The S&P traded down on below average volume. Which tells me stocks on the S&P are nearing oversold.
BUT it’s only my opinion. I’m not responsible for bad trades. :)
2621 2018-11-21 01:58:00 Donald opens mouth spews Lies "BUSTED"  Ivanka (emails) Donald(Charge his enemies list)  Stocks plunged, with the S&P 500 and Dow erasing gains for the year.Both the S&P 500 and the Dow have erased year-to-date gains as of market close Tuesday. Each is now down about 1% this year
2622 2018-11-21 01:57:22 And all the stock markets gains he’s been bragging about all year were wiped out today, but of course when stocks drop it’s not his fault.
2623 2018-11-21 01:57:12 It’s amazing the amount of people who measure economic strength based on tech stocks. Even more amazing is the number of people celebrating market losses because they think it reflects poorly on Trump. This is gold.

2642 2018-11-21 01:45:31 US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as investors continued to be plagued by doubts surrounding slowing global growth, US-China trade relations, and the steady rise in interest rates that is expected to continue into next year.

2651 2018-11-21 01:41:26 We expect further pullbacks on the horizon for the major indices as the markets reprice growth stocks for a less optimistic 2019.

2681 2018-11-21 01:23:48 It was due to social media and technology stocks they need to get it together
2682 2018-11-21 01:23:12 ALL the FAANG stocks are now in a bear market. The Momo crowd is dumping them, and they were the only thing holding the stock market up the last 18 months. Cryptos have been getting absolutely slaughtered. BTC under $4500, ETH under $140. Oil hit a death cross today, IIRC #DOOM

2684 2018-11-21 01:23:05 Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.

Ignore the noise, trust the code.
2685 2018-11-21 01:22:37 Yes I believe they  are selling bonds used as collateral for owning levered stocks which now have margin calls . When sales subside bonds explode

2687 2018-11-21 01:22:03 Hello @AskRobinhood I’d love to make OTC trades for stocks like LBCC and other mining corps I found on the Internet as well as foreign companies like @Samsung Is there any hope of those coming to @RobinhoodApp anytime soon?
2688 2018-11-21 01:21:54 Maybe it’s the Chinese dumping US stocks in retaliation to his brilliant tariffs strategy.
2689 2018-11-21 01:21:04 @HumblePenny @Vikingsixty2 Was all about which stocks. Some exceptional ones like $PDD Others like $SQ pushed up well off lows with volume.

2702 2018-11-21 01:08:54 I am loving the world where Carlos Ghosn are villianised and stocks of Trump, MBS, Duterte, go up. Mediocrity is winning. Genius is condemned. Very AYN RAND.
2703 2018-11-21 01:08:53 There is. Karting (automatic and Shifter), Sprints, local stocks, Formula SAE, etc. etc. The list goes on. One just doesn’t obtain their provincial driving licence and then hop into an F3. They’re at that level because they’re good enough and experienced enough to be.
2704 2018-11-21 01:08:13 Trump is now the first sitting president to be sued over the emoluments clause. Stocks in free fall. Tired of winning yet republicans?

2706 2018-11-21 01:07:52 I don't think the bull is dead or dying right now, not until all the buybacks are dried up and global avg rates shoot up. Pick the right stocks, the right balance sheets; stay away from ETFs, be small and opportunistic, keep higher levels of cash.

2709 2018-11-21 01:06:15 UK finances far from perfect but project fear proven to be mythical. UK does have an over inflated stocks market thats needed asjustment & currency weakening that makes UK exporting more attractive. It improves UK balance of trade. EU economy is the big risk & will drag UK down.

2711 2018-11-21 01:04:53 Tokens that are considered securities absolutely serve a purpose! They could be the decentralized version of stocks granting owners the right to decide over a smart-company and getting a share of the profits in return.

2722 2018-11-21 00:57:47 Is that not some people's issue though? Stocks are pointless to them if they aren't allowed to exploit them. Take back control and fish it into the ground for the maximum short term gain?
2723 2018-11-21 00:57:04 I stuck too with about 10k

2725 2018-11-21 00:55:09 You’re simply wrong on this one, Swamo. 

There is no conspiracy theory in either client portfolio balancing before a “binary” readout or conviction investing in biotech stocks.

There is “no last to know”. I personally lost a decent chunk of cash and I had ALL the information.

2730 2018-11-21 00:53:18 Also, as far as investments go I have seen too many times how inside trades steal from IRAs and go into CEO pockets.  I think corp. putting worker money into stocks without their consent should be illega. Saving Bonds did very well for older American's before greed took over.
2731 2018-11-21 00:53:13 This guy is a loon. 
Some of the stocks I bought in April of this year that are up.
AstraZeneca up 23%
Diageo up 14%
Unilever up 10%
GlaxoSmithKline up 9% 
National Grid up 5%
Relx up 3%
All the others I hold are down but I read today US Stocks have given up all 2018 gains.

2744 2018-11-21 00:46:42 Gravity implies normal stocks. This is the stock that can make up financials. Those don't trade like the regular stocks. They are not bounded by economic laws. The end is always the same, though. Money runs out. So gravity is a wrong way to think about it.

2768 2018-11-21 00:35:16 I have seen in fintel that Morgan Stanley have reduced position in all the 4 stocks in my portfolio last 2 days . Maybe they are selling a little bit of everything ? Port: $AMRN $FNKO $BILI $BZUN . $BILI growing great even some metrics +200% but going down AH. Let’s see $BZUN tmw
2769 2018-11-21 00:35:02 Umm no, it’s because sales are falling below expectations. And why is that? Wages are stagnant but cost of commodities keep going up.  All those tax cuts that big business got? They used them to buy back their own stocks. Trickle down economics DO NOT F’ING WORK!!!!
2770 2018-11-21 00:34:28 Also, do not use bump stocks, automatic or semi-automatic firearms OR missile launchers. Do not point a gun at someone and then pull the trigger.  Don't leave your guns where a child can reach them and shoot themselves or you dead.  Dead is dead. Deader than romaine.
2771 2018-11-21 00:33:59 Only so long #stocks can keep climbing - while the visible economy looks like a big Caribbean tourist island of nil-wage jobs, "jobs" now typically don't leave investable income at the end of the month.
2772 2018-11-21 00:33:37 A lot of good and honest posters down at mo, best thing to do imo is just roll with it, good stocks will out in the end. Switch off an see it thru, enjoy the race, hopefully next few weeks will see a pick up.. we hope. GL

2776 2018-11-21 00:32:30 Stocks pullback isn't even close to what is happening in Bitcoin. For the year, the NASDAQ is basically flat. The small caps are down 5%. The S&P is down about 1%.

2780 2018-11-21 00:29:54 If you have tech stocks on NYSE you must be weeping in the corner, all the gains of 2018 went out the door as DOW fell 600 points today.
2781 2018-11-21 00:29:48 Of course, they are! Once the Dems took the House, stocks were doomed. The only thing that will save the economy is the Senate standing firm and fast against her and her zombie mob!
2782 2018-11-21 00:29:31 Any good stocks to invest in
2783 2018-11-21 00:29:25 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX declined after the bottom signal, a common bottom signal aftermath recently.  NDX then extended the bottom signal into a stronger version, also seen before lately.  This plus that SPX completed a bottom signal near the close, albeit a poor one, points to...

2790 2018-11-21 00:25:59 So let me get this straight. You say buy and hold bitcoin even though it's prone to 80 percent crashes, but investors should bail on stocks, even though stocks have a couple hundred year track record of continuously going up. #thatslogical
2791 2018-11-21 00:24:33 Legalizing hemp <> Legalizing CBD for human consumption. Plus many states have hemp on their own controlled substance lists that will need to be removed. So farm bill is a major positive for the industry, not exact for stocks tho imo

2793 2018-11-21 00:22:52 It includes a back-of-the-envelope calculation about how much should pay an investor for $AMZN stocks. Its conclusion is no more than $650 (in May 2017, -32%) to get a 10% annual return during 10 years, assuming Amazon´s annual growth of 30%!!! and PER 20 by the end of the period
2794 2018-11-21 00:22:28 Yes.  Not many people know that, though. Just before the referendum, I heard an expert explain that fish stocks in the Shetland area are - or were in 2016 - at a historic high, thanks to conservation measures.  But experts were out of fashion.
2795 2018-11-21 00:22:07 U.S. stocks tumble, putting the S&P 500 and Dow industrials at risk of wiping out their yearly gains. I believe that just the thought of the Marxist Democrats in charge of the House is to blame for this & it will get worse.
2796 2018-11-21 00:21:41 Just my opinion but the market sell off is due to the owners of those stocks...the Chinese. They also own huge amounts of our debt and interest rates rising. They also own HUGE amounts of real estate. AND it’s economy is crumbling and will until we come to terms.
2797 2018-11-21 00:20:54 Don’t own any alcohol stocks, but that’s not a bad idea either
2798 2018-11-21 00:19:04 Stocks! Start letting the veggies rot! And —bonus — something to do with all that romaine!
2799 2018-11-21 00:18:46 The Game, who’s been rapping for like 15 years, posted his bank account balance one time and it was only like $13 mil. I mean he could have money in other banks and stocks/investments so idk can’t really judge their value off their cash alone. PS fuck 6ix9ine
2800 2018-11-21 00:18:12 Saw it coming a long time ago. I dumped a lot of paper and shifted it to metal while prices were down. As stocks rise precious metals decline and vice versa. Stock market took off when Dems lost power now we will start to see the stalling of the economy.
2801 2018-11-21 00:17:59 lol, scuba stocks
now snorkling is your new term for buying stocks that are under water
you're welcome
2802 2018-11-21 00:17:10 Don’t worry about the market. Tech stocks are always overpriced and are almost a Ponzi scheme. Watch money flow out of the market and into the money market as interest rates rise
2803 2018-11-21 00:16:24 There’s a new board game out called ‘Pass the Buck’. Available from Tory HQ while stocks last.

2806 2018-11-21 00:14:55 OK. What stocks did he not sell?
2807 2018-11-21 00:14:45 There needs to be Black Friday deals on Stocks.
2808 2018-11-21 00:14:07 Sorry to hear that, Vishal. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will be checking on this and we'll make sure that this won't happen again in the future. Hope you were able to get one before stocks ran out today.
2809 2018-11-21 00:12:00 You may join this party but don't poop. Lemme put this way, it's like overvalued stocks during {pumping and dumping} period in securities trading.

Taking profits and walk away~

Don't mind my random mind
2810 2018-11-21 00:10:15 This Market Flush and the gutting out of all the zombie debt in our indexes would be a welcome event. Stocks will be real value and we can trust our investment grade debt and actually get a fair dividend.
2811 2018-11-21 00:09:56 Two stocks that survived my watch list this week. $EGBN & $USFD.
2812 2018-11-21 00:07:33 I'm against ridiculous calls, they do the same thing with oil and stocks
2813 2018-11-21 00:07:09 In Grade 10 History (CHC2D) students participated in the 1939 stock market simulation, where they had to buy and sell stocks. Students learned how easy it was to get caught up in wanting to buy more, but also in how they could lose everything.
2814 2018-11-21 00:06:36 "You don't need a research analyst when stocks are going up, you don't want a research analyst when stocks are going down" - Somebody said it.
2815 2018-11-21 00:06:31 The stocks icon?
2816 2018-11-21 00:05:14 All fang stocks look very oversold and could be entering a rally period very soon.  This selling cannot last forever and nothing continuously goes down.  A FANG rally would drag the whole market.

2818 2018-11-21 00:04:40 US stocks have extended their recent sell-off, with the S&P 500 hitting a three-week low, as energy shares dropped with oil prices and retailers including Target and Kohl's sank after weak earnings and forecasts.
2819 2018-11-21 00:04:12 Well sure but that’s not fun so why would you do that? Smash is about fun. Timed matches promote chaos and “smashing”, being more wild and better with parties, because if you lose all your stocks, you’re sitting there watching everyone else. That blows
2820 2018-11-21 00:04:02 Prob not a great signal for status of the bottoming process stocks are in. Let's spike vol and get a flight to quality bid sooner vs. later please.  

Or you think large amount of current and future treasury supply might keep flight to quality confined to short duration?
2821 2018-11-21 00:03:28 This guide incorrectly represents the @Highcarbonstock and needs to be corrected. The HCSA identifies all forests & not just about carbon - it includes biodiversity & rights/livelihoods. The guide says “only the forests with the highest carbon stocks (HDF) are classified as HCS”
2822 2018-11-21 00:02:54 Entertainment and movies and news reporting SHOULD be unbiased but like social media platforms it is more and more and people can't understand why tech companies dropped in the stocks I already dumped fb and soon Twitter.  GET TO THE MIDDLE AGAIN PLZ AMERICA NEEDS IT!!!

2824 2018-11-21 00:02:01 U.S stocks slipped whipping out yearly gains, investors drove down prices for everything from retailers and energy companies to oil and #bitcoin
2825 2018-11-21 00:01:55 I’m not sure exactly. It seems like a confluence of supply and demand issues both long and short term.  Normally one would expect more bond support with weaker stocks. This alone suggest a real problem looming mostly for stocks.
2826 2018-11-21 00:01:13 The stock market is finally adjusting and signaling the recession in midyear 2019. It is important to appreciate that the stock market is an excellent, not perfect, leading economic indicator. With tariffs, uncertainties and rising rates the economy is slowing. #stocks #wsj #ft
2827 2018-11-21 00:00:41 U.S stocks slipped whipping out yearly gains, investors drove down prices for everything from retailers and energy companies to oil and #bitcoin
2828 2018-11-21 00:00:40 And also it is moments like this where I really stepped back and took a deep breath and was like “good thing I started investing and buying stocks” because if not, my feelings in my gut would have been much worse.
